            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            ¶The preface to the booke of chyldren.
            
               ALthoughe (as I doubt not) euery good mā will enterpret this work to none other ende, but to be for ye comfort of them yt are dyſeaſed, and wyll eſteme no leſſe, of me by whom they profyte, then they wil be glad to receiue the benfeytes: Yet foraſmuch as it is impoſſible to auoid the teeth of malicious enuye, I thought it not vnneceſſary to preuent ye furies of ſome▪ which are euer gnawynge and bytynge vpon them that further any godly ſciences. To thoſe I proteſte, yt in all my ſtudyes, I neuer entended

nor yet do entēd to ſatiſfy ye mindes of any ſuch pikfaultes (which wyll do nothynge but detract and iudge other, ſnuffynge at all that offendeth the noſes of theyr momiſhe affeccions, howſoeuer laudable it be otherwayes:) but my purpoſe is here to doe them good that haue mooſt nede, yt is to ſaye children: and to ſhewe the remedies that god hath created for the vſe of mā, to diſtribut in Engliſhe to them that are vnlerned, part of ye treaſure that is in other lāguages, to prouoke them that are of better lernīg, to vtter theyr knowlege in ſuch lyke attemptes: finally to declare that to the vſe of many, whiche ought not to be ſecrete for lucre of a fewe: and to communicate the frute of my labours, to

them that wyl gently and thankefully receyue them, which yf any be ſo proude or ſupercilious, that they immediatly will deſpiſe, I ſhal frendly deſyre them, with the wordes of Horace: Quod ſi meliora nouiſti, Candidus imparti, ſi non, his vtere mecum. If they knowe better, let vs haue parte: yf they doe not, why repine they at me? why condemne they the thing that they cannot amēd? or yf they can, why diſſimule they theyr cō
               nyng? how long would they haue the people ignoraunt? why grutch they phiſike to come forth in Englyſſhe? wolde they haue no man to knowe but onely they? Or what make they thē ſelues? Marchauntes of our lyues and deathes, that we ſhulde bye our healthe onely of

them, and at theyr pryces? no good phiſicion is of that mynde. For yf Galene the prynce of thys arte beyng a Greciā wrote in ye Greke, kynge Auicenne of Arabie in the ſpech of his Arbyans: Yf Plinius Celſus, Serenus and other of the Latines wrote to the people in the Latyne tonge: Marſilius Ficinus (whome all men aſſente to be ſingulerly learned) diſdayned not to wryte in the language of Italy: generally, yf the entent of all that euer ſet forth any noble ſtudye, haue ben to bee read, of as many as wolde: What reaſon is it that wee ſhulde huther muther here among a fewe, the thing that was made to be common vnto all? Chryſt ſayeth: no man lyghteth a candle to couer it with a buſhell,

but ſetteth it to ſerue euery mans nede: &amp; theſe go about, not only to couer it when it is lyghted, but to quench it afore it be kīdled (if they myght by malice:) whych as it is a deteſtable thynge in any godlye ſcience: ſo me thynketh in thys ſo neceſſarye an arte, it is excedynge damnable and deuylyſhe, to debarre the fruycion of ſo ineſtimable benefytes, which our heauenly father hath prepared for our comfort and innumerable vſes, wherwyth he hath armed our impotent nature againſt the aſſaultes of ſo many ſickneſſes: whereby his infynyte mercye and aboundaunte goodneſſe is in nothyng els more apparauntly cōfeſſed, by the which benefites, as it were with moſte ſenſible argumentes ſpokē out of

heauē, he onſtraineth vs to thinke vpon our owne weakenes, and to knowledge, that in al fleſh is nothyng but myſerye, ſyckneſſe, ſorowes, ſynne, afflicciō, and death, no not ſo muche ſtrengthe as by oure owne power, to relyeue one member of our bodyes dyſeaſed. As for the knoweledge of medicines, comforte of herbes, maintenaunce of health, proſperytie, and life, they be his benefites, &amp; procede of hym, to the ende that we ſhould in common, helpe one an other, and ſo lyue together in hys lawes and commaundementes: in the which doyng we ſhal declare oure ſelues, to haue woorthelye employed them, and as frutefull ſeruauntes, be liberallye rewarded, Otherwyſe, vndoutedly the

talente whyche we haue hidden, ſhall be dygged vp, and diſtributed to them that ſhall be more diligente: a terrible confuſyon afore ſo hie a iuſtice, and at ſuch a court where no wager of lawe ſhall be taken, no proctoure lymytted to defende the cauſe, none excepcion allowed to reproue the wytnes, no councell admytted to qualifye the gloſes, the very bare texte ſhall be ther alleged. Cur non poſuiſti talentum in fenus. Whye haſte thou not beſtowed my talent to the vaū
               tage. Theſe and ſuch other examples, haue enforced me beyng oftentymes exercyſed in the ſtudye of phiſike, to deriue out of the pureſt fountaines of the ſame facultye, ſuche holſome remedyes, as are moſt approued, to the conſolacion

of them that are afflicted, as farre as God hath gyuen me vnderſtanding to perceiue: folowing therein, not onlye the famous and excellent authours of antiquitye, but alſo the mē of highe learning now of our daies, as Manardus, Fuchſius, Ruellius, Muſa, Cāpegius, Sebaſtiā of Auſtrike, Otho Brimfelſius, Leonellus. &amp;c. wyth diuers other for mine oportunitie, not omyttyng alſo the good and ſure experimentes that are found profitable by the daylye practyſe. And where as in the regimente of lyfe, whyche I tranſlated oute of the frenche tonge, it hath appered to ſome, more curyouſe than nedeth, by reaſon of the ſtraunge ingrediens, wherof it often treateth: Ye ſhall knowe that I haue

For lyke as the ayre is hote and moyſte: ſo is the bloud hote and moyſt. And as fyer is hote and dry: ſo is choler hote &amp; drye. And as water is colde and moiſt: ſo is phlegme colde and moiſte.

Colde and moiſt, which is the cōplexcion of the water &amp; of phlegme: and colde and dry, that is the complexion of earth and of melancholie.

                  ¶Remedye. Ye muſte geue hym morne and euen to drinke, ſirupe of violettes, or pomegranades with a meane draught of endiue water in a glaſſe, or of comin water ſodden and cooled agayne. And in ſtead of theſe ſirupes ye maye drynke water of endiue, ſuccorye, purcelane &amp; nenuphar myngled together, or one of them by them ſelf, two or .iii. daies at euenyng and morning. Then geue a drāme of pillule ſine quibus, at night to bedwarde, or about midnight, &amp; the day folowing kepe you ī your chāber. In ſtede of thoſe pilles, it is good euery

mornīg to take an houre afore ſūne a medicine to drynke, yt ſhall be made of halfe an ounce of Succo roſarum, mixt with two ounces of water of endiue. In ſteade of the ſaied ſucco roſarum, ye may take halfe an ounce of diaprunis laxatiue, &amp; ye muſt take hede in gyuyng ſuche purgacions, that the pacient be ſtrōg, for if he be weake, ye may gyue hym but the halfe of ye ſayd pylles or of the other laxatyues. And yf in diminiſhyng the quantitie of the ſayde medicines, it worketh not with the pacient as it ſhuld, it is conueniēt to gyue hym a common gliſter.
               
                  ¶An other remedy for the ſame peyne. Ye muſt laye theron a lynnen clothe moyſted in roſe water, plantayne water, morel water, and vinegre, or elles take the iuyce of lettuce and roſes, &amp; a litle vineger, and warme it together, and dippe therin a linnen clothe, and laye it to the payne.
               
                  An other. 
                  Ye muſt take the whytes of .ii. egges, wyth roſe water, and beate it well togyther: and wyth towe or flaxe, lay it to ye greued place. Alſo ye muſt ſhaue his heed, and mylke thereon womans mylke, that nouryſheth a wenche, or waſſhe hys heed wyth warme water, wherein haue bene ſodde vine leaues, ſage, floures of water lilies, &amp; roſes. Alſo it is neceſſary to waſh his feete &amp; legges wyth the ſayde water, ſo that the pacient haue no reume: for if there be reumatike matters, ye oughte nether to ſhaue his heed, waſh his legges nor to lay any colde thing or moiſt to his heed. Ye maye knowe that fleume is cauſe of the peine in the heed, when ye fele coldneſſe with great heuineſſe: ſpeciallye in the hyndre parte: when one ſpytteth often, and hath his face lyke ſunne brent.
               
                  ¶Remedye. Ye muſt drynke .iii. or .iiii. morninges ſirupe of ſticados with water of fenel, or ſirupe of wormewood, with a decoction

of ſauge and maiorym. Then ye muſt pourge the heade from the ſayde fleume, wyth pillule cochie, and wyth pilles of agarici, or pillule auree made with one of the ſayde ſirupes, fyue in a dramme, and take .iiii. or .v. at nyght to bedwardes, or about midnight. Or in ſtead of thoſe pylles ye maye take a pocion in the morning .v houres afore meat, made of half an ounce of diacartami diſſolued i.ii. or iii. ounces of betonye. After that ye ought to comfort the head, by wering of a coife, made of double linnen cloth, and ſowed lyke a cotten quilt, wherin ye muſt put floures of camomil, maiorim, cloues, nutmygges, maces, graines of Paradyſe and ſynamome in pouder, for ſuche thinges digeſt ye fleume, ſo that a purgacion be geuen of the ſayde pilles, or of pilles aſſagareth, or pilles of hierapicra, which are not ſo laxatyue as the other are.
               After the ſaide purgacion, ye muſte put in the noſe of the paciente, pouder

of pellitorye of Spayne or other, to make hī to neſe Alſo it is good to gargariſe his mouthe, with water wherein ſage hathe bene ſodden, and then to annoynte his head with oyle of lilies, camomil, or of rue.
               Beſide this, it is good to geue the pacient euerye morning to drinke, ſage-wine with water, to cōſume ye fleume and to coumfort the braine and the ſynowes. The ſayd wine is thus made.
               Put a litle bagge full of good ſage bruſed, in a quart of newe wyne, &amp; let it ſtande ſo a nyght, then wring it out and vſe it. Suche wyne of ſage the inhabiters of Pariſe and Fraunce, vſe to drinke after harueſte all the winter longe.
               When peine of the head procedeth of melancholie, the paciēt feleth heuines of ye heed, and hath terrible dreames, with great care &amp; thoughte, or feare, &amp; his peine is ſpecially vpon ye left ſide.
               
                  ¶Remedye. Take ſirupe of borage, heartes toūge

or fumytorye, with water of bugloſſe, and harteſtonge, or with the decocciō of ſage or time, for by theſe ſirupes ye ſhal digeſt and correct the ſaid melancholyke humours, and within a while the peyne wyll be releaſed. And yf it ceaſſe not for theſe medicines, after ye haue vſed .ii. or .iii. dayes one of ye ſaid ſirupes, or two or thre of thē togither, take a dramme of pylles, halfe auree: &amp; halfe ſine quibus: or elles halfe of hiera, &amp; halfe of pilles of fumytory: or in ſtede of pylles, ye may take in ye morning fyue houres afore meate .iii drammes and an half of diaſene, tempered in water of borage or hoppes, or in the decoccion of ſage, licorice, great reyſins, and cordiall floures &amp; frutes. Heed ache cōmeth of winde or ventoſitie, when the paciente thinketh that he heareth ſound or noyſe in his heed, and the peyne is flytteryng from one place to an other, wythout heuyneſſe or deſcendyng humoure.
               
                  ¶Remedye.

                  ¶An other remedy. Ye muſt take oile of Camomil, oyle of Dyll or Lylies, and annoynte the hed wyth one of thē, or wyth .ii. or .iii. or all togyther. Yf that helpe not, take oile of Rue, Spike, and of Caſtor, &amp; anoynt it therwyth: and adde therto alytle Pepper, and muſtard ſeede, yf ye would haue it ſore chafed or hette. Alſo it is good to drawe vp by the noſe, water of Hony, the iuice of Maiorim, and of Fenell, aromatiſed wyth a Nutmygge and lignum aloes.
               Raſis a great practicioner among phiſicions ſaythe: yt whoſoeuer often

               Yf peyne of the heade come of heat of the ſunne, ye muſt applie to the places diſeaſed, as it is ſaide in the remedyes of cholere.

a chicken, or veale, yf the paciente bee feble,
               When payne procedeth of a colde humour, the pacient ought to drynke no wyne in thre of the fyrſt dayes, but to drinke onelye peniale, or ſuche ſmale drinke, for although the wyne bee very comfortable, as concerning natural heate, yet it is contrarye and hurteful vnto the ſpirites animal of the brain, and alſo of the ſinnowes.
               And the paciente ought what payne ſoeuer it be of the head, to forbeare all vaporous meates, as garlyke, onions, leekes, peaſe, beanes, nuttes milke-meates, ſpyces, muſtard, greate colewortes, ſalt meates, and meates of yll dygeſtion.

in qualitie or quantitye, &amp; ſometimes by reaſō of the fleume that deſcendeth from the heade like a reume.
               
                  ¶Remedye. Keepe abſtinence, and eate ſoberlye light meates, and drinke good wine, and but litle. Purge the ſtomake, ī takynge pylles of ſymple hyera beefore meate .iii. or foure of the ſaid pilles at foure of the clocke in the mornyng. If the repletion be greate, ſlepyng in the nyght he muſte laye hys hande on hys ſtomake, or els laye a litle pillowe of fethers on it, or a bagge of wormwod &amp; margerim. Sometimes ther chaunceth ſuche debilitye, not for reume, or meate or drinke, but by viſcouſe &amp; ſlymy fleume, ī the mouth of ye ſtomake, which cauſeth to engender aboūdaūce of ventoſitye, and maketh the meat to ſwymme with litle thirſte. And ſometimes with ſour belchinges, and inflations, ſuch debilitye maye not perfectlye bee cured, but for a tyme mended wyth the remedies that folowe.
               
                  
                  ¶Remedyes for weakenes of the ſtomake. Fyrſt ye muſt take pillule ſtomatice ii. or .iii. houres afore meate, more or leſſe accordyng to ye quantitye of the fulnes of the ſtomake, &amp; after geue him euery mornyng .ii. houres afore meat, and one houre after ſupper, at euerye tyme a lozenge of a lectuary called diagalāga, or an other called diaciminō whiche lectuaries do conſume ventoſities, and with theyr cōfortable heat, driue away the colde and the windye complexion of the ſtomake.
               
                  ¶For the ſame. Grene ginger is verye good taken as is ſayd afore of electuaries. And it is holeſome to eate afore your meate, anyſe ſedes and fenel, and when ye begin to eate, take a toſt dipped in ſodden wine, or good malueſye withoute drinking of theſame wine, except it be a verye lytle after meate.
               
                  An other. Take maſtike and lapdanum, of euerye

one an ounce, mintes, and wormewood poudred, of eche a dramme, turbentine, as muche as ſhall nede to encorporate them together, make a plaiſter and ſpred it vpon lether, and laye it to the ſtomake. In ſtede of the ſayde plaiſter, it is good to annointe the ſtomake with oile of ſpikenard, and maſtike, or to laye on it hoote breade ſteped in good wyne, on the which bread ſtrowe pouder of cloues &amp; nutmigges.
               Sometimes ſuche debilitye of ſtomake cōmeth of hote cauſes, &amp; thē it is knowen by the litle appetite to meat, and great thyrſt, and heade ache before meate, and after, it commeth ſtinkyng belchyng, whereof ſometime foloweth vomiting, and is holpen on this wiſe.
               
                  Remedye. In ſuche debilitye if ther be great quantitie of ſpittle, and muche deſyre to vomite, it is good to take .x. drammes of hiera picra, with the decoction of cicers, or with two or thre oūces of water of wormewood, and after your

meat vſe coriander ſeed prepared, and beware ye drinke not thereafter, nor ſlepe in the day time,
               
                  To theſame. Mirabolanes condite are very good for the ſame purpoſe, to be geuen once in the weke, at four of the clocke ī the morning, half an ounce, or a hole oūce euerye tyme, and take awaye the ſtone that is within. If in the ſaide debilitie of ſtomake of hote cauſe, there be not aboundaunce of ſpittle, but drineſſe of mouth, with thriſt and vomiting, ſtinking &amp; fumiſhe, it is good to take euery mornyng ſyrupe of ſorell, ſyrupe of roſes, or ſirupe of quinces with endiue and ſuccorrye water, or water ſodden and cooled again, and then drinke hiera picra, as afore is ſaid, or take a purgacion as is declared in the payne of the head, comming of cholere. It is to be noted, that for ſuch debilitie of the ſtomake, ye maie not weare any cerote plaiſter, nor bagge, wherin is hote medicines leſt ye ſhould augmēte ye cauſe▪
                  
but it is conueniente to annoynte the ſtomake with colde oyles, as be oyles of roſes, and quinces, and yf ye wyll haue a plaiſter, make it of redde roſes and ſaunders.
               
                  For abhorryng of meate. SOmetime there chaunceth in the ſtomake, a dyſeaſe called faſtidium, or abhorrynge of meate, wherby the perſone agaynſt his wyl taketh in hate and abhominacion all maner of meates, that is offered vnto him: likewiſe as a hole man taketh pleaſure and delite in hys meat. The cauſe of this diſeaſe, is repleciō of cholericke humors or phlegmatike, groſſe and viſcouſe, whiche are in the ſtomake, &amp; the paciēt hath great thriſte, a drye tonge, the mouth bitter, &amp; ſometime doth vomit yelow cholere
               
                  Remedye. Ye muſte purge the cholere as hath bene ſaide afore, and yf the veines bee great and ful of bloud, ye ought to let him bloud on the right arme, &amp; on that

veine which appeareth moſte: and to quicken the appetite it is good to geue him to eate or drinke, ſuch as the pacient demaūdeth, although it bee not alwayes of the beſte, And alſo it is good to geue him ye iuce of pomegranades.
               
                  ¶For belchyng. Belchyng is a vētoſitye inſtatiue expulſed oute of the ſtomake to the mouth, and commeth by feblenes, and litle heat of the ſtomake, which engendreth winde, wherefore it ſignifieth a colde complexion, whiche is cauſe of ſuche ventoſitie after meate. And for this diſeaſe ye ſhall do as foloweth.
               
                  ¶Remedy for windineſſe of the ſtomake. Abſtaine from al fruites, and rawe herbes, peaſe, beanes, garlike, onions, leekes, cheſnuttes, courſe meates, great repaſte, and ſlepe on the daye. Ye ought to take faſtinge, comfites made of aneys, fenel, cummine, and carreway ſeedes, or els pouder of the ſayde thynges myxte wyth ſuger. Alſo it is

good to take in a morning two houres before meat, a lozenge of aromaticum roſatum, &amp; if ye haue an aking ſtomak and cold, it is good to take euery morning a lozenge of dianiſi, or diaciminū or ſome other cōfortable lozenge, &amp; to drinke after it a ſponful of good wine.
               
                  ¶Another remedy. Ye maye take a litle galingale, with a litle wine, or pouder of cumine with ſome good wyne.
               
                  ¶Another remedye. Drinke euery morning faſtyng, two oūces of wine wherin hath bene ſodden baye beries, anyſe, &amp; carraway ſedes, of eche a litle. And if ye put to it a litle pure frankenſence, it would be ye better. And withoute, it is good to laye a bagge full of camomyl floures, rue, wormewood, and maiorim made in pouder, or for to annoynte the ſtomake with oyle of wormewoode, rue, ſpikenard, or bayes.
               Sometimes ſuche belching and vē
                  toſitie cōmeth before meate, and it is

cauſed of fleume viſcouſe, or watriſh, that is in the ſtomake.
               
                  Remedye. Ye muſt purge the fleume with pillule cochie, or electuariū of diacartamy as hath bene ſaid in the remedy of peine of the heed cauſed of fleume. And ere ye geue the purgacion, ye ought .iii or .iiii. morninges two houres afore meate, to take two litle ſponefulles of ſirupe of wormewood or of mintes. After the which purgacion, it is good to annointe the ſtomake with oyle of maſtike, nardine, wormewod or lilies &amp; for to weare vpon the ſtomake a cerote beyng made lyke a plaſter, which ye may bye at the Apotecaris, called cerotum Galeni, or a bagge made of maiorim, and camomil floures, &amp; take euery mornyng a lozenge of the electuary aboue named, or of diagalanga.
               Item ye ſhal note, that yf the perſō can not take a purgaciō, to auoyd ſufficiently the fulnes of the ſtomake, which hyndreth the digeſtion of meat,

he muſte take a gliſter, and afterwarde pilles of elephangine, or of hiera ſimplicis, before diner or ſupper. Moreouer, yf before dynner ye fele an heuines in the ſtomake, ye oughte to take one of the ſayde pilles, halfe an houre before meate.
               
                  For the hicket. Hicket or yeaſkyng, is an euill mouing of the vertue expulſiue of the ſtomake prouoked by the vertue ſēſible, to expulſe that that dothe anoye. The ſaid hicket doth ſometimes happen by reaſon of emtines, by debilitie of the ſtomake after lōg ſickenes, or by fluxe of blud or laxe, or by ſome other ſtrāge euacuacion, which is very perillous &amp; oftentymes mortall. Therefore it is good to geue reſtoratiues to the pacient, and to geue hym ſoft egges, almō mylke, hulled barlye, culleyes of capons, or other thinges of good noriſhmente, and of eaſye digeſtion.
               Alſo ye ought to ſtoppe the laxe, &amp; to make the pacient to ſlepe long and annointe

the ſtomake with oyle of ſwete almons. Sometimes hicket procedeth of repletiō of matter humorous, or of drinke and meat which engēder groſſe ventoſitie, &amp; not very eaſy to conſume. Yf ye ſtomak be ouercharged with meates, kepe a lōg abſtinēce til digeſtiō be done, or els vomit and annoint thi ſtomake with oile of dil, maſtike, wormwood &amp; caſtor. If humors conteined in ye ſtomak be cauſe of ye ſaid hicket, take an ounce of hierapicra with water of wormwod or els pilles āte cibū .3. or 4 houres before meat, &amp; eueri mornīg folowīg ye operaciō of ye ſaid hierapicra, take a lozenge of dianiſi or diaciminū
                  ▪ or els a few aniſe ſedes &amp; carawaies.
               
                  ¶Regiment for al maner hicket. It is good to kepe longe and often hys breath, to neſe, to trauayle muche, to endure greate thyrſte and alſo to ſleape longe. And it is good to caſte cold water in the face of him that hath the hicket, and to threaten him, and ſo

put him in feare, and to anger hym, or els to prouoke hym to heauyneſſe, for by theſe thinges the naturall heat is reuoked and fortified within, and cauſeth the hicket to ceaſe.
               
                  For vomityng. Vomiting commeth ſometimes without great violence, &amp; thereby one getteth health, wherfore ye nede not geue him any remedy, for it is a good acciō of the naturall vertue of the ſtomake. Sometime vometinge commeth by a great violēt mouinge of the vertue expulſiue of the ſtomake, for the euyll thynges conteined in theſame.
               
                  ¶Remedye. One maye well helpe a man to vomite, geuyng hym warme water with a litle oyle to drinke, or els to put the finger in his mouth very lowe, or a fether wetre in oile, the better to vomit and mundifye the ſtomake, yf ſo be the perſone haue a wide throte, and that vomityng do not hurte him muche, as be they that haue but ſmal and ſtrayte

throtes, and long neckes and leane, &amp; he that hath an euyl ſyght, for al theſe it is euyll to vomite,
               Sometymes vometing commeth by weakenes of the ſtomake, cauſed of a hote and euil complexion, ye ſhal heale it after this maner.
               
                  Remedy. Take ſirupe of roſes, quynces, myrtylles, wyth water ſodden, and colde againe, or elles water of purcelane for to refreſſhe and quench the thirſt that chaunceth commonly in ſuche a caſe. And it is good to anoynt the ſtomake before dynner &amp; ſupper, with an ointment made of oyle of roſes, and quinces, wyth iuce of myntes▪ and a lytle waxe, or els to make a plaiſtre of mintes, roſes, wormewood, &amp; oile of roſes and laye it to the ſtomake
               
                  An other. Take frakenſence, maſtike, of eche half an ounce made ī pouder, and mē
                  gle them togyther, with the whyte of an egge, and a lytle barlye floure, then

ſprede it on a lytle towe, and laye it to the mouth of the ſtomake. At ye latter ende of diner, it is good to take a morſell of marmalade wythout drynke.
               Somtyme vometyng procedeth of eiul &amp; colde complexion of ye ſtomake.
               
                  ¶Remedye. Anoint the ſtomake with oyle of ſpikenarde &amp; maſtike, or els make an ointmente of the ſayde oyles, wyth a lytle maſtyke, corall, and waxe, and anoynt the ſtomake morning and euenynge.
               
                  ¶An other medicine. Make a bagge of wormewood, maiorym, and drye myntes, of eche a litle handful, cloues, galingale, and nutmiges, of eche halfe a dramme, the ſayde thynges poudred, and put betwyxt .ii. linen clothes with cotten enterbaſted and applied vpon the ſtomake, are of wonderful operacion. In ſtede of this ye maye take the ſayd herbes dried on an hote tileſtone, and put them in two linnen cloutes vpon the ſtomake.
               
                  ¶An other maner. 
                  Ye maye take a toſte of breed &amp; ſtepe it in the iuce of myntes, and caſt vpon it pouder of maſtyke, then lay it vpon the ſtomacke, and from thre houres to thre houres let it be renewed,
               
                  Otherwyſe. Take two handfulles of myntes, and a handfull of roſes ſodde in wyne, thā take two ounces of toſted breed, and moyſte it in wyne, and incorporate it wyth pouder of maſtike, and the ſayde roſes &amp; myntes, and make a playſter wherof one parte muſt be layed to the ſtomake when the pacient would eate any meate. The ſayde playſter is alſo good in all hote cauſes, yf for the ſaid wyne, ye ſeeth the myntes and roſes, and ſtepe the toſte in vinegre.
               
                  ¶To comforte the ſtomake after vomytynge. It is good to gyue vnto the pacient euery mornynge an ounce of ſirupe of wormewood, or myntes, in ſteade of whych it is cōuenient to take a lozēge of aromaticū roſatum, or diagalanga.
               
                  
                  For the ſame. Take euening and mornyng .iii. houres before meate .ii. cloues in pouder, with a ſponefull of the iuce of mintes, or halfe a ſponefull of rue, dryed, with a lytle wyne,
               Alſo it is good to take poudre of cloues, and lignum aloes the weyght of a crowne, wyth wyne .ii. houres before meate.
               
                  ¶A glyſtre for the ſame. And here ye muſte note, that in all vomiting, yf the pacient be harde bellied, it is good to take a lēitiue gliſtre made of the decoccion of marche mallowes, mallowes, violettes, and, barly wyth oile of violettes, home of roſes, and a litle caſſia. And yf the vomiting come of coldnes of the ſtomake, or of cold water cōteined in it, adde vnto ye ſaide gliſter, wormwood, yſope, rue, &amp; cammomylle in the ſethyng. And for oile of violettes, take oile of camomil or of lylyes, and geue the pacient a pil of maſtyke before meate. And ye ſhall

vnderſtande, that myntes brayed, and myngled wyth oyle of roſes, and applyed vpon the ſtomake, is verie good for all vomiting.
               
                  ¶For peyne of the ſtomake. Ache or peyne of the ſtomake commeth ſomtymes of wynde, &amp; it is called dolour extenſiue, the which is holpen with applyīg therto a ſponge wet ī wine, wherin hath ben ſoddē wormwood, rue and camomyll.
               Alſo ye maye helpe it as hath ben ſaid in the remedy of hycket or yeaſkynge, and as ſhalbe ſayd hereafter in the remedy for all peynes of the ſtomake.
               Sometymes the ſayde payne commeth of repletiō of humours, and it is called dolor aggrauatiuus. Whyche ought to be cured by purgacion, in giuing of caſſia newly drawen out, hiera picra, or pylles ſtomaticas, or of hiera ſimple, takyng ſome ſyrupe before the purgaciō, as is ſhewed in the remedy of debilitie of ſtomake.
               Somtymes payne of the ſtomake cō
                  meth

of cholere, or ſalte fleume verye ſharpe, and ye pacient hath bytter taſte or ſalt with great thirſt, and he fealeth heate and mordycatiō. Wherfore it is good to drynke ſirupe of roſes, or occiſaccarū ſimple with ſoddē water and coled. In ſtede whereof ye maye take endiue water, ſuccory and purcelane with one part of wormwood water, &amp; then take an euacuatyue that purgeth cholere, as is ſayd in the remedies for peyne of the head cōmyng of cholere, or let the pacient vomite, in geuing a ſharpe ſyrupe of ſorelle, wyth warme water, thā put his finger in his mouth ſo that he maye vomyt.
               Sicke folkes often diſeaſed in the ſtomake, demaunde nothing elles, but to take awaye the peyne, not regardinge ye time while the matter may be purged by vomitīg, gliſter or other laxes.
               Alſo there caunceth ſometyme ſo greate payne &amp; ſharpe, that for debilytie of vertu it is good to leaue ye cauſe and ſticke to the ſwaging of the paine▪
                  
wherefore it behoueth to procede in maner folowyng.
               
                  ¶Remedye for all paynes of the ſtomake. TAke camomil, melilote, wormwoode, mallowes with theyr rootes, leaues of bayes, parietary and peyryalle, of eche a handful, lineſeed a pounde, fenugreke halfe a pound, anees, and fenel ſeed, of eche halfe an ounce.
               The ſayde thynges bruſed and well ſodden in water, wet therin▪ ſponges, and the licour wel preſſed out, and applied vnto ye ſtomake, one after an other, and warmyng them againe, whē they begynne to cole, ſwage all maner paynes of ye ſtomacke, And afterward ye muſt annoīt the ſtomake with oyle of dylle and camomylle.
               
                  ¶An other remedye. Take an hogges bladder, and fyl it of the ſayde decoction, and lappe it in a linnen cloth, and lay it to the ſtomake and warme it agayne when it is cold.

But after ye haue made dyuerſe ſuche applicacions. Ye muſte annoynte the ſtomake wyth the oyle aforeſayde. Yf the payne be remouing from place to place, it ſignifieth it commeth of ventoſiti. Therfore lay vnto it a bagfull of meale, ſalte, and commin dried togyther.
               
                  ¶An other remedye. Take a ſponeful of hote aſſhes, dewe them wyth good wyne, and couer thē wyth a linnen cloth: that it goe round aboute the ſpoone, and laye it to the ſtomake.
               
                  ¶An other remedye. Take a ſheue of breed metely thycke, toſte it, and wete it in hote oyle of camomyl, as hote as it commeth from ye ouen, or in oyle of ſpyke, and wrappe it in a linnen, and lay it vpon ye paine.
               
                  ¶An other remedye. Put a great boxyng glaſſe vpon the nauyll, and let it be there .i. houre.
               
                  ¶An other remedye for payne of the ſtomake. 
                  Take two drammes of diaciminon, of dianiſi, of diagalanga, &amp; drynke it with a litle good wyne, an houre or .ii before meat. To drinke two oūces of malueſye, with a litle of one of ye ſayd electuaries, is very good for ſuch paines as procede of coldneſſe or vētoſite
               
                  ¶An other remedye. Take, a drāme of galingale in pouder, and giue it to drinke with a litle hote wyne, and aboue al thynges for paine of ventoſitie, a ſinguler remedye is to drinke a litle Caſtor, with good wine.
               
                  ¶An other. Lykewiſe to drynke two houres before meate thre or foure ounces of the decoction of mītes, anneis ſeedes, comyne and fyne frankenſence.
               Alſo it is good to drynke an electuarye called aromaticum, whereof ye maye receiue one lozenge euery mornyng faſtyng.
               
                  ¶An other ſpeciall medicyne. Take halfe an ounce of iuce of mintes,

               ¶The ſyxt Chapter, of remedyes for diſeaſes, of the liuer.
               
                  THe liuer is one of ye principall mēbres &amp; chefe inſtrumente of generacion of blood &amp; of other mēbres, it lyeth on the ryght ſyde vnder the ſhort rybbes, ye whyche is ordeined to digeſt the meate the ſecōd tyme, and thereof to make humours that nouryſheth al ye membres of mā
                  nes body, by his natural heat, cōforted by heat of the hert. But ſomtymes it is greued by blood in to much aboundaūce, or by cholerik humours, which cauſe to greate heate, or els by fleume

                  A remedie for an hote lyuer. Yf the lyuer be to hote, bycauſe of to moch blood, the perſon hath red vrine, haſty pulſe, his veines great &amp; ful, and he feleth his ſpattle, mouth and tonge ſweter then it was wont to be, wherfore it is good to be let blood of the liuer veine on the right arme, and to vſe letuſe, ſorelle, purcelane, &amp; hoppes in pottage, and ſometymes to drynke of ye waters of the ſaid herbes faſting, or els endiue water to refreſhe ye liuer.
               
                  Regiment for diſeaſe of the liuer comming of blood. 
                  YE muſte abſtaine frō drinkyng wine, and eatynge of fleſh, and yf at meat or drīk ye muſte otherwyſe, ye wine ought to be watred, and the fleſhe boiled with lettuſe and ſorel. It is better to drinke ptyſan, or ſtale cydre, &amp; eate brothe of peaſon, almon mylke, hulled barlye, or roſted apples, and damaſke

               And it is to be noted, yf the pacyente be very weake or eaſye to worke vpō, ye maye take away a drāme both of ye diaprunis, &amp; alſo of ſucco roſarū. After the ſayd purgaciō, it is good to refreſh the liuer with laying to without on the right ſide, vnder the nether ribbes, a playſter of cerotum ſcandalinū, ſpred vpon a linnen clothe of the bygneſſe of .iiii. fyngers, or bath the ſayde place with a lynnen cloth wet ī water of endyue, plantayne and roſes, warmed togyther. Moreouer it is good to take euery morning before meat, a lozenge

It is good to vſe broth of peaſe and veriuce, lettuce, popie, ſpinage, and borage, and ſometyme a litle vinegre yf he be not greued in the ſtomacke. This regimente is good alſo in tyme of peſtilence, and of to great heate.

the veines of the holowe parte of the lyuer, and is perceiued thē by ye griefe which the pacient feleth in his backe, and in his reines. And it is healed by thynges that opē, as by ſirupes of the three rootes, ſirupes of biſantius, ſyrupes of maydenheere, and by drynking ye decoction of rayſins, fenel, percely, ſmallache, cicory, or waters ſtilled of theſame herbes. Alſo rootes of aliſaunder is good for the ſame. &amp;c. Sometimes the ſaid oppilacion commeth of groſſe bloude, earthy, and melancholike, whiche the members ſend vnto the liuer, and beecauſe that ſuche engendred bloud can haue no iſſue, nor hath any way to departe to any other mēbers, therfore be ye veines of the liuer ſtopped vp by the groſſenes of the ſaide bloude. And it is knowen by the water, yt is very hie coloured, &amp; cleare.

                  ¶Medicines for the lyuer that may be eaſely had at al times. Take a good handeful of liuerworte that groweth vpon the ſtones, and an other of fumetorye, wyth as muche of harteſtonge, and ſeeth them in whaye clarefyed, and drinke them euery daye twyſe.
               The liuer of an hare dried and made in pouder, is good for all diſeaſes of ye liuer, as affirmeth Auicenne and other of the Arabians.
               Alſo for heate in the liuer ſeeth barberies in whey, and drinke them.
            
            
               ¶The .vij chapter, againſte the dyſeaſes of the gall.
               THe gal is placed in the holowneſſe of the lyuer, to receyue the ſuperfluitye of cholere, and to ſende it to the bowels to be auoided with the groſſer excrementes,

to thintente to clenſe the bloud of the ſaide cholere.
               To the which there commeth oftentymes oppilacions in the parties about by the liuer, or beneth in it ſelfe next the bowels, cauſyng great paine, by reaſon whereof the cholere turneth agayn vnto the lyuer, and there is mē
                  gled with ye bloud, and ſpred abrod into all the veines of the body, and bredeth a dyſeaſe named iaundis (ictericia in latin) wherof be thre kyndes▪ yt is to ſaye, yelowe iaundis that procedeth of cholere called citrine or yelow, grene iaūdis which procedeth of grene cholere, and blacke iaundis that proceth of blacke choler, whiche is called melancholy, and commonly commeth of the oppilacion of the ſplene.
               
                  Remedye for iaundis. Yf the iaundis happen in an ague, before the ſeuenth daye, the pacient is in great daunger of his lyfe, as Hipocrates ſayth. But yf it appeare in the ſixth daye, being a day iudicial or cretike

of the ague, or after, it is a verye good ſygne.
               And then ye muſt ſuccoure nature, in refreſhyng and digeſting the choler, with ſirupe of violettes, geuen in the morning wyth water of morel, or ſyrupe of endiue, with water of cicorye.
               After this purge the cholere as is ſayd in remedies of the liuer. And thā geue him a lozenge of triaſādali, with reubarbe, euerye morning two houres before meat, and drinke a litle waters of endiue, and cicorye, afore the ſayde lozenge.
               Moreuer, it is good to bathe the liuer as it is ſaide afore, and waſhe the pacientes eyes with vinegre, and womans mylke, &amp; drinke a ptiſane made of barly, liquirice, prunes, and ye rootes of fenel. And yf (when the feuer is paſte) the iaundis tarieth ſtyll, the paciente muſt drynke water of fenel, and morelle, with the ſyrupe of occiſaccarum compoſt, and it is good to laye a quicke tenche vpon the liuer.
               
                  Iaundis ſometime commeth without feuer, and maye bee healed by the thinges that I declared here beefore, or thus.

In ſtede wherof it is good to drinke eueri mornyng foure ounces of the decoction of horehounde, made in white wine, or as muche of the decoction of celidonie and barberies, with a litle honye and ſaffron.

Wherfore it is good nouriſhyng for al

the membres, and is ye cauſe that maketh a bodye merye, but oftentymes there happeneth oppilaciō or debilitie wherof commeth the blacke iaundys.
               And ſometymes it is greater, fuller, or groſſer then it ought to be, by ouermuch melancholie that is not natural, cauſed of the dregges of the bloud engendred in the liuer, &amp; doth hindre generacion of good bloud, wherthrough the members become drye for defaute of good nouriſhyng. And therefore the pacient is called ſplenetike, whiche ye maye knowe by that, that after meate they haue payne in theyr left ſyde, and are alwayes heauy, and hath theyr faces ſomwhat enclining vnto blaknes.

In oppilacions and apoſtemes of the ſplene, whether it be of hote humours or of colde, he ought to be let bloud on ye ſplene veine called ſaluatella, which is in thee left hande, betwene the litle finger, and the next fynger which they call medicus. And ye muſte drawe out

but a litle bloude.
               And if the pacient fele a burning on the left ſyde, and hath a drye tonge without appetite, it ſignifieth that ſuche diſeaſe of the ſplene, is cauſed of an hote humoure. Wherefore ye muſt geue the pacient four or .v. morninges faſtinge, ſyrupe of endiue water, and harteſtong, then a purgacion made as foloweth, thus.

Or whether it commeth of cholere, &amp; then ye muſte receiue a litle ſirupe of roſes, pomegranates, or ribes with water of plantain. Than purge ye choler yt geueth ſuch ſharpnes to ye bloud, by .x. drammes of trifera ſarracenica, wyth two ounces of plantayn water, or the medicine of reubarbe, wrytten in the treatiſe of the fluxe humorall.

                  ¶An other. Take the iuyce of colewortes and of walworte, and wyth beane floure, and pouder of redde roſes, and the floures of camomyl, make a playſter and laye it to the ſore.
               
                  ¶An other. Take oyle of roſes, crūmes of bread, yolkes of egges, &amp; cowes mylke, with a litle ſaffron, ſeeth thē togyther a lytle as ye wold make a pudding, afterwarde ſprede them vpon cloutes &amp; lay vpon the ſore.
               
                  
                  ¶An other. Make lye of the aſhes of roſemarye, or of oke, or of beane ſtalkes, &amp; boyle in it, ſauge, moleyne, prymroſe, camomil, and mellilote, and receiue ye fume vpon ye ſore place, or wette cloutes in ye ſayde decoccion, preſſe them and lay them vpon the payne.
               Al the ſayd remedies are verye good to ſwage the payne of the goute, after the which done, it is neceſſary to go about the comforting of iointes and ſinowes, and to that intent ye may apply the greſe of pyes, oyle of camomil &amp; of althea or holihocke, oile of a foxe, oyle of earthwormes, oyle of prymroſes, turbentine, oile of gromel brayde, wherwythall, or with one or two of them ye may annoynte the ſore place, and comforte both the ſynowes and ye ioyntes marueylouſly. Alſo thys ointmente that foloweth is ſynguler good for the ſame purpoſe.
               Take fyue or ſyxe handfulles of walworte, and ſeeth them well in wyne:

then ſtrayne them, and with a lyttle waxe, oyle of ſpike and aqua vite, make an oyntment wherwith ye muſt annoynte the place mornynge and euenyng euery daye.
               
                  An other oyntment for the goute. Take a fatte gooſe, and plucke her, and trymme her as yf ſhe ſhuld be eaten, then ſtuffe the belly within with two or thre yonge cattes, wel chopped in ſmal gobbettes, with an handful of baye ſalte, then ſowe her vp agayne, &amp; let her roſte at a ſmall fyre, and kepe the dryppyng for a precious ointment agaynſt all kyndes of goutes, and other diſeaſes of the iointes.
               
                  Medicines for the gout appropriate in al caſes. Take cowes donge, and ſeeth it in ſwete mylke, and lay a playſter to the goute hote.
               Alſo the yolkes of egges, womans mylke, lyneſeede, and ſaffron al together

in a plaiſter, ſwageth the diſeaſes of the goute.
               And yf ye be diſpoſed to brake thee ſkinne, and to let ye humours iſſue (as by ſuche manye one is eaſed) ye ſhall make a lytle playſter of blacke ſope, &amp; aqua vite, which wil bliſter it without any greate payne.
               Alſo very olde harde cheſe cutte and ſoddē in the broth of a gambon of bakon, and afterward ſtamped with a lytle of the broth, and made in maner of a playſter, is a ſinguler remedye for diſeaſes of the goute, and was fyrſt practiſed of Galene the prince of all phiſicians,
               
                  A prayer to God for helpe, agaynſt the perturbacions of the mynde. 
                  O Lord my God almightye father, &amp; ruler of my life, my health, my ſtrēgth, my redemer, and protectoure, ſēde vnto me the heauenly

beames of thy holy ſpirit, to illumine the darkeneſſe of my ſynfull hert, and to guide me to thy holy place. Shewe me ye light of thyne aboundaūt mercy (O Lorde) that I may no lōger ſleape in deedly ſynne. O only father of light which in very dede doſt lighten euery mā that commeth into this world, for thy great mercies ſake it maye pleaſe thee, to lyghten the eies of myne hert, and to endue me with the ſpyrite of grace, that I maye loke vpon myne owne ſinne, the great offences wherewith I haue offēded thee, and to know yt in my ſelf ther is no maner ſtrēgth, for to wythſtande▪ the death, but only throughe thee. And I beſeche thee, o lord, to couer theſe my carnall eyes, yt they ſe no vanitie, and gyue me thy grace, yt I fal not into cōcupiſcence, to thend I may eſchewe al euil thinges, and gyue my mynde hollye to the obſeruacion of thy commaundementes. Lord God I beſeche the, that ſyn may neyther raygne nor tarye in me, and

that I be not ſubiecte to myne owne fleſhly appetytes, but yt I may expel out of my thoughtes aſ vnlawfull luſtes, ſo that my ſoule and al my mind, maye be ſet holy vpon the. Lord God ſuffre not my ſoule to be oppreſſed▪ but receyue me into the proteccion of thy holy hand, and deſpiſe not me thy ſimple creature, whom thou haſte redemed with ye preciouſe blood of thine onely ſōne Ieſu Chriſt. Thy mercy O lord is aboue al yt thou haſte made, for thou doeſt differ the punyſhmēt of the wycked, yf perchaunce they would amende at laſt, thou loueſt al that thou haſte made, &amp; hateſt none but for their owne iniquities. And whē the wicked turne agayne to the, and crye vnto thy holye name with all theyr hertes, by &amp; by thy mercye is ready to receiue thē, euē as I mooſt deteſtable ſīner come with hert cōtrite vnto thy mercy this day: that I may obtayne remiſſion of my ſynnes. To the I cry out of ye veri depth &amp; botome of mine hert, go not

awaye from me my maker &amp; redemer, but heare the ſupplicaciō of my praier. For thou arte mine onelye hope and myne enheritaunce in the lande of liuers. I haue ſinned, I haue ſinned (O Lorde) and heaped vp iniquitie euen agaynſte heauen, and afore the. But I knowledge myne offences, and deſyre mercye according to thy goodneſſe. Deſtroy me not (O Lord) among ſiners, nor let me not deſcend into the lake of deathe, that I vnworthy creature being made worthy onely by the bounteouſneſſe of thy grace, may from henceforth lyue in thy commaundementes, loue, honour, and praiſe thee. For al heauenly powers, angels, thrones, and dominacions, laude and praiſe thy holy name▪ world without ende. Amen.

               But to them that doe repente, and put their onely truſte in him, who can doe but wonder at his infinyte benygnitie, and goodnes, that euen in the middeſte of al the ſaide affliccions, prouydeth them of remedyes leſt thei ſhould dyſpayre: cureth and amendeth all theyr grieuous ſores, languours and diſeaſes: he created medicine euen out of the earth, and of the wyſe manne it ſhall not bee dyſpyſed.

Whiche thing although many noble and moſte excellente learned men haue in times paſte worthely conſidered, and therevpō according to their ſinguler knowlage and induſtries geuen to them of

               A treatiſe of the peſtilence. What is ment or ſignified by this worde peſtilence,
               
                  PEſtilence is none other thing but a venemous infecciō of the ayre, enemye to the vital ſpirites, by a certayne malicyouſe and euyll property (and not of any quality elemental that is within it ſelf.) For euen as pure triacle is a coumforter of life, not becauſe of heat, cold, moiſtnes or drynes, but foraſmuch as out of al his cō
                  poſicion there redoundeth a certayne fourme agreing to the forme of the vital ſpyrites of our body: ſo is the foreſaid vapour enemy to our natures, not for any quality, as is ſaide before, but for that, yt his proporcion is direct euē contrary to our vital ſpirites, cōſiſting in ye heart, which vital ſpirites, if by ye wil of god, &amp; ordinary diet, be ſtronger in the paciēt thā ye foreſaid vapour is,

thei driue it from the bodye, &amp; wil not bee infected. And if it happen that the foreſaid ſpirites bee weaker then the venim, or the body ful of humors apte to putrefaccion, then it dothe incontynent aſſaut the liuelye membres, &amp; except remedy, bring the body quickly to deſtruccion. But when we do ſaye the vapoure to bee venemouſe, we meane not that it is a poyſō of it ſelf in dede, for then ſhoulde euery creature be indifferently infected, and none ſhoulde eſcape that draweth it in breath: but I cal it venemouſe, for that it is of ſuche a naughty qualitye, yt it may be lightlye conuerted into venime, that is to ſay, apt to burnyng and coroſion, as do mercury ſublimed, quicke lime or ratten bane, and other ſuch like kindes of venims. Thus ye maye perceiue that all the greate daunger that is in thys diſeaſe, commeth of the noughtines of humors, which are made apt to receiue the ſaid vapours, &amp; not by violence of ye infected aire only.

               A prouident phiſicion among many other thynges, ought to conſider the entring of the ſūne into Aries, by true equacion of the houſes and planetes, for that influēce hath more dominacion, thē haue all the other influences of the hole yere beſide, excepte the ſuperiour coniuncions of the planetes, or els ſome greate eclyps. And this entryng of the ſunne into Aries, paſſeth al the entringes of the ſunne into any other ſigne.
               Therefore you muſte conſyder how the lorde of the .vi. houſe in the figure is diſpoſed, for he is lorde of ſickenes, that is to ſay, you muſt conſider whether he be impedite or no, and yf he bee impedite, there ſhal be many ſickeneſſes,

accordynge to his nature and hys houſe, that is the .vi. houſe, as by example thus.
               Be in caſe that Saturne is the lord of the .vi. houſe, and ſome earthy ſigne is in theſame houſe, then moſt cōmonly the ſickenes of that yere, ſhalbe of like nature, that is, colde and drye.
               And ouer this thou muſte conſyder, whether that the lord of the .vi. houſe hath any aſpecte with the lorde of the houſe of death, or the lord of the houſe of death to him, then moſte commonly the ende of thoſe ſickeneſſes that are colde and drye ſhalbe death.
               And likewiſe as it is declared of the entring of the ſunne into Aries, ſo it muſt be ſaide of the coniunccions of ye ſunne and moone, through al the yere, marking euer the nature of the planet beyng in the .vi. houſe, yf ther be any, and the aſpectes to thoſe twoo houſes aforeſayde. &amp;c.
               Alſo he muſt conſider, whether this entryng of the ſunne into Aries, or anye

of the coniuncions of the luminaries, bee in the eighte houſe or no, for then it ſhould be much worſe.
               And note, that if the eclipſe of the ſunne or mone, be in any of the angles of the natiuity of any perſon, or in any of the angles of the reuolucion of hys natiuitye, then he ſhal ſuffer ſickeneſſe accordynge to the nature of the ſame angles. And if the ſaide eclypſe bee in the myddeſte of heauen, he ſhall ſuffer hurte in his honoure and fame: and yf it be in the aſcendente, he ſhalbe grieued in his body, and ſo foorth of other houſes, but it ſhalbe the worſer, in caſe the eclipſe be in the aſcendent, ſpecially if it be the eclipſe of the ſunne, for yt is the more daungerous of the two, for aſmuch as the effect of ye eclipſes of ye mone, is alwayes finiſhed in the ſpace of one yere at the moſte, ſometyme in leſſe, and for the moſte parte in three monethes.

               The Aſtrologians take the iudgement of the yere, by the entryng of the ſunne into Aries, in the firſte minute, and if it then happen that al the yl planetes be in the eyght houſe, whiche is the houſe of death, they ſaye that yere ſhall ryſe a peſtilence, and diuers other ſickeneſſes, accordinge to ye nature and condicion of thoſe planetes.
               And yf the moone in the ſame entryng be nere vnto the coniunction of ye ſōne, as ſometime happeneth, within .ii. or thre, or four degrees, that yere ſhalbe a death and peſtilence vniuerſal and that ſhortely after that coniunccicion, ſpeciallye at the comminge of the mone and the euyl planetes to infortunes, &amp; as ye infortunes be, yt effectes ſhall ſo appeare, be they more or leſſe.

                  ¶Of the thyrde roote or cauſe of thys outragious ſicknes. THe third rote or cauſe being inferiour, is the ſtynch and filthy ſauours that corrupte that ayre whiche we lyue in: for we can not liue wythout drawynge of the breath, and we haue none other breth but of the ayre rounde aboute vs, which yf it be ſtinking, venymous &amp; corrupt, and we

                  Of the fourth roote or cauſe of the ſayd diſeaſe. THe fourth rote is, the abuſe of thinges not natural, that is to wete of meate and drynke, of ſlepe and watching, of laboure and eaſe, of fulneſſe and emptyneſſe, of the paſſions of the minde, &amp; of the immoderate

vſe of lechery, for the exceſſe of al theſe thinges, be almoſt the chefe occaſion of all ſuch diſeaſes as raigne among vs now a dayes.
               For all that of our meate and drinke is not digeſted, turneth anon to putrefaction and to euyll qualities.
               And to muche ſlepe repleniſheth the body with to great aboundance of humours, but ouer muche watching doth drye vp the natural humidities.
               And as watching doth, ſo doth immoderate labour, and as ſlepe doth, ſo doeth reſt and eaſe out of meaſure, put the body in greate diſtemper, and maketh it apte vnto thys ſiknes, as is dayly ſene.
               And whoſo wyl be ruled as becometh him in thys caſe, ſhal neuer be lightly infected, &amp; if chaūce he be, he ſhal eaſelye with a lytle helpe, ye ſomtyme by verye nature onlye, ſaue him ſelfe and ouercome the ſicknes.
               Nowe ſeyng that the cauſes of thys ſayd diſeaſe be ſo great as is afore reherſed,

it is not to be wōdered, though the thinge it ſelfe be verye huge and daungerous, and of harde curacion▪ wherfore ſayeth Auiſen in his firſt of methaphiſikes (althoughe he were no chriſtian:) we muſt with good and vertuouſe lyuing mitigate the wrathe of god, and by continuall prayers kepe our ſelues ſtyll in the ſtate of grace.

And this done vndoubtedly the ſyckeneſſe of the bodye ſhal be the eaſyer to be cured,

                  Alſo it is good to rectifie the ayre within the houſe, yf it be in ſomer, by ſprynklyng in the chamber vynegre, &amp; water of roſes: if it be winter or colde make a luſty fier of clene wood, &amp; put in it encence, mirre, laurel tre, or iuniper, or cipres: and in tyme temperate, mingle the hote thinges with ye colde aforeſayde.

And in cold times, take ſage, laurell, minte, wormwood, nept, bawme, rue, and galingale, whiche thynges ye maye ſomtyme cary aboute wyth you in a cloth to take the ayer of them.

                  The Apoticaries ought to haue in ſtore bothe the twoo ſortes, and to ſee that they be ſufficiently leuened, and that the foreſaid aloes be elect &amp; pure.
                  They which haue the hemoroydes and woulde vſe the foreſayde pylles, lette them adde a litle maſtike, or the gumme that is called bdellium. Yf any haue a bloudye fluxe, or excoriacion

of the bowels, lette hym not receyue thē without a better counſel. Women alſo greate with chylde, and they that are ſubiect to any fluxe of bloud ought not to receyue them.
                  Amonge other thynges, it is a good preſeruatiue, and a thynge wel experte and commended, to eat in the morning faſtyng one drye fygge, one walnutte, and foure or .v. leaues of rue, chopped all together, and afterwarde to drynke a draught of good wyne. But it ſhalbe ſufficient for them that are with child to take the ſayde thynges, leuyng oute the rue.
                  In an hote ſeaſon it is good to temper the ſayd wine with a litle roſewater or of violettes. Some other take .v houres afore diner, thre times a weke, the weight of half a crowne of mithridatum, or of fine treacle, tempered in a litle good wine. But in time of heat and for hote complexions, it is good to put in it a litle conſerua roſes, &amp; to mingle them with water of ſorell, or

of borage, or of bugloſſe.
                  Mithridatum is a greate medicine againſt al kind of venime, for we reade that the founder of it, kynge Mythrydates, who dydde vſe to eate thereof, coulde neuer be hurt by anye kinde of poiſon. Theſame Mithridates beyng ouercome in battayle of ye Romaines, woulde haue killed himſelfe with the moſte ſwyfteſt poyſon that coulde bee deuyſed, but when he hadde dronken manye ſortes of ſuche, and neuer a one wroughte anye thynge to purpoſe, he cauſed hymſelfe to bee ſlayne of hys ſeruauntes, after whoſe death Pompeius, the graund captain of the hooſt, founde in hys ſecrete coffers, a certain byll written of hys owne hande, in effecte thus.
                  Twenty leaues of rue .ii. fatte figges, two walnuttes, and a litle ſalte, whoſoeuer eateth of this ſhal be ſure from al kynde of venime that daye.
                  The good triacle alſo hath a greate vertue, but there ought to be a puniſhment

of them that dooe abuſe it wyth counterfaicted ſtuffe, which deceiueth many people and cauſeth them to dye, that put theyr truſte in it.
                  Some other take in tyme of colde, a cloue or .ii. of garlike, which is called ye houſebandmans triacle, &amp; after drinke a draughte of good wine, and in hote time take and eate a few leaues of ſorell, and drynke a draughte of the water therof diſtilled, for it is excellent &amp; good in all complexions, tymes and ages. Alſo it is good to drynke euerye mornynge a draughte againſt the peſtilence that is thus made.
                  
                     ¶A drinke for the peſtilence. Take in the moneth of Iune or at any other conueniēt time, our lady thiſtle, burnet, ſcabious, gētiane, ſorel, of euery one a like much, floures of bugloſſe, red roſes, herbe dragons, and matfelon or marſus diaboli, twiſe as much as all the other, ſtepe them al in white wine &amp; roſewater, during one nyghte, then ſet them al in a cōmon ſtillatory,

waying in for euery pound of herbes, half an ounce of bole armeny poudred, augmentynge the proporcion, accordynge to the quantitye of the herbes: then ſtyl a water, and for euerye pynte of it, take the weighte of a crowne of ſaffron, half an ounce of yelowe ſaunders finelye poudred, and put them all in a violle with the foreſayde water ſtopped, and ſet them in the ſunne one moneth. This is a noble water for a manne whiche hath the peſtylence, to drynke.
                  And he that wil, maye put a litle ſuger, and pouder of cinamome in it, that it maye be more pleaſaunt in the taſte. He that can not fynde the ſayde herbe called matfelon, or morſus diaboli in latine, let him take the double weight of dragons. It hath a roote as it were halfe eaten of by the myddes, and it is ſo called, becauſe the fable is, the deuil bit it of, for thenuy he hath to mā, leſt we ſhoulde obtayne the great vertues of the ſame.
                  
                     The horne of an vnicorne put in the drinke, whole or ī pouder, hath a great effecte againſt the ſaid dyſeaſe, and againſte all kyndes of poyſon.
                  
                     ¶Here foloweth a very good preſeruatiue for the common people, ready at al tymes and of ſmal coſte. Take an ounce of leaues of rue, half an ounce of good figges, one ounce of Ienuper buries, twoo ounces of walnuttes piked .iiii. ounces of vineger, &amp; a good quantitye of ſaffron, ſtampe all the foreſaide thynges together, and reſerue them in an earthen cuppe, or a glaſſe faſte ſtopped, that no ayre yſſue, whereof yf ye receyue in the mornyng vpon a knifes poynte, the quaintity of a beane, or more, ye ſhalbe ſure by the grace of god not to be infected in four and twenty houres after.
                  
                     ¶An other pouder for the ſame. Take pure and electe bole armonyacke,

not counterfaict, but ſuche as is without grauel, ſmoth, ſomewhat ſhinynge, and to the eye a farre of moſte like a very ſtone, not to brittle, nor to hye coulored, for ſuch is commonly ſophiſticate. Take I ſaye, the ſayde bole armoniake, &amp; grynde it vnto fine pouder, than waſhe it in white wyne or in roſewater, or water of bugloſſe, ſorell, or wormewoode, or ſcabious, afterwarde drye it and pouder it agayn, and doe ſo .v. or .vi. tymes, euer waſhinge, drying and pouderyng the ſame, and at laſte ſet it vp in a cleane veſſell, tyll ye nede to vſe it.
                  Men of hote complexion, yf they wil receiue it, muſte take of it a ſponefull with vineger, or water of ſorel.
                  And they that be of colde complexion, maye take it in a litle wyne, or ſcabiouſe water in the mornynge. For it preſerueth the bodye, from all corrupcion, conſumeth the ſuperf
                        •
                     uous humours, and driueth awaye the venym from the herte.
                  
                     
                     An other ſinguler remedy preſeruatiue for ryche men and delicate of complexion. TAke zedoarie, lignum aloes, agrimoni, ſaffron, ariſtologia rotunda, yf it maye bee gotten, whyte dyptanye, gentian, the rinde of a citron, the ſede of citron, of euery one a ſcruple, corianders preparate, turmentil, red ſaūders, red coral, red roſes, iuori, mirabolanes, emblike, of eueri one a dramme, terra ſigillata, two drammes, bole armonyake three drammes, pouder all theſe, and wyth fyne ſuger, and ſirupe of acetoſitate citri, make a noble electuarye, and kepe it as a treaſure of mans health, in the tyme of peſtilence.
                  
                     An other ſoueraine and goodly receite bothe preſeruatiue and curatyue. 
                     TAke a hēnes egge, newly laid, and make a hole in the crown, by the which ye ſhall draw out al the white thereof, and leaue the yolke within the ſhell, which done fyll the ſame egge, with good englyſh ſaffron whole, as much as may be ſtuffed in the ſhell, than drye this egge againſt the fyer, or in an ouen, whan the bread is out, ſo longe tyl the ſhell bee vtterlye blacke and brent, and the reſt ſufficiently brittle and drie, make it in pouder in a morter, and adde to it aſmuch pouder of muſtarde ſede as ſhall weye al the hole egge: than take thys ingredience at the apothecaries. Ditamy, turmentille, nux vomica, of eche a dramme, pouder euery one of them by it ſelfe, then put them altogether, and put to it rewe, pionie roote, zedoarye, camphere, and fyne tryacle, of eche equal portion, ſo that the weight of thē v. be aſmuche as al the reſt, beat them in a morter by the ſpace of .ii. houres, tyll all bee incorporated together in a

lumpe, than put it in a glaſſe, and kepe it couered with a lefe of gold, in a cold place, for it wyl laſte thus .xxx. yeres, without corrupcion, and is a thing of ineſtimable value in this caſe: the doſe of it to preſerue, is but one halfe peny weight, or leſſe, yea the weyght of one barlye corne, hath in it a marueylouſe ſtrength, in defendyng the body.
                  But yf one were infected alredy, than he muſte receyue afore lettyng blood ii. or .iii. graynes, after his bleedynge gyue hym in the name of god, an hole ſcruple, or, ii. or, iii. (yf his ſtrengthe wyll ſerue) tempered with wine for a hote takynge, and in great colde with a litle aqua vite, and therupon ſweat. ¶I haue knowē whan the ſicke hath bene vtterlye deſperate, and could reteine nothing, yet by the grace of god, thorough ye meanes of two ſcrupules hereof, myxte with a litle aqua vite, bothe the vomyte immediatly ceaſſed, and nature recouered, eſcaped the daunger of death.
                  
                     
                     AS concerning ſwete waters to ſprinkle vpō your clothes and thynges of pleaſaunt odoure, to be caſte vpon the coles when ye aryſe on mornynges, and alſo the makynge of good and holſome pomaunders, to ſmel vpon in tyme of peſtilence, for the contentacion of them that are deſyrous, I ſhall here rehearſe i. or .ii. of euerye ſorte, to the entent ye maye (whan ye be diſpoſed) eyther vſe them, or deuiſe other of the ſame makynge: as it ſhall be requiſite accordyng to neceſſitye.
                  
                     Fyrſte a ſwete water that is made thus. TAke water of roſes, violettes or nenuphar, or one of them, or of al togyther one pound, good vinegre two oūces, ma

any gallia muſcata, adde thereto halfe a dramme, mingle them togither, and ſprinkle vpon your clothes, whē ye be diſpoſed. The ryghte excellente, and famouſe doctoure Iohannes Manardus alſo, in the thyrde epiſtle of hys fyfth boke, doeth ſhewe, how to make in tyme of Peſtilence, two ſoueraigne perfumes, the one for to ſerue in ſommer whyche is made thus.
                  
                     A Fumigation for Somer.

                     ¶But in winter ſeaſon ye maye vſe this. TAke ſtorax calamita, yreos, maſtyke, of ech two partes, cloues, maces, nutmigges, cinamome, ſaffron, of eche one parte, aumbre the fyfthe of one parte, muſhe the tenthe of one parte, mingle all togither and make a fumigacion.
                  And of theſe pouders ye may make litle balles or pomaūders, to beare about with you at al times, but the laſt receyte muſt be wel incorporate with a lytle ſtorax liquida, and lapdanum, &amp; the other with lapdanum, gumme, dragagant, and roſewater.
                  
                     ¶An other goodly pomaunder for gentlewemen and ladyes. TAke the rind of an orenge, cloues, lignum aloes, of eche, one dramme, calamus aromaticus half a dramme, alipta muſcata one dramme, roſes, myrtylles, of euery one half a dramme, nutmigge, cinamome,

                  ANd in the tyme of peſtilence, ye ought to kepe the houſe euery day til the ſonne be vp, and if it chaunce that ye go amōg a great multitude of people, wher is any daunger to be feared: ye may chew a litle zeddary in your mouth, ones in an houre or two, but hold it not cōtynuallye for hurtynge of the gummes, zedoarie (as ſayeth Auicenne in hys boke de viribus cordis) cōforteth the herte, and engendreth good blood, it is holſome for the ſtomake (as affyrmeth Plinie) maketh good digeſtyon, and prouoketh appetyte.

                  When the ſunne ſhinethe in a cleare day, ye maye walke in gardeynes, medowes, hilles &amp; by riuers, but beware of lakes, ſtandyng pooles, and fennes, for oftentymes the enfection of the ayre, aryſeth of the corrupte vapoures, boylyng out of ſuche vnholſome places.
               
            
            
               The ſeconde parte, of the cure of one that is enfected with the peſtilence alreadye.
               
                  Howe to knowe a man that is infected, the fyrſt chapter.
                  
                     WE ſayd in the beginninge, how ye peſtilence was engendred of the corrupt and noughtie ayer, turning all the humoures of the body quycklye to corrupcion &amp; to venyme. Wherefore we muſte take hede be tymes, leſt the vital mēbres be infected

of the ſayd poiſon, for it euer ſeketh to the hert, and yf it come vnto the hert, afore the medicine, then is there no recouery, for not one amōg an hūdred lyueth. For the ſayde venyme is ſo ſwyfte, ſo fearce, and ſo boyſtous of it ſelfe, that it wyll not (without greate difficultie) be put out of poſſeſſion, but dryueth awaye the medicine from the herte agayne.
                  But yf the medicine come vnto the hert afore the venym hath the vpperhande, then he dryueth it oute, by the helpe of the vertue expulſyue, of the ſpyrituall membres, and that expulſiō commonly is by ſwette.
                  And for becauſe ſomtimes a man is poyſoned, &amp; can not tell him ſelfe, nor none that is about him, wherof many daūgers doth ariſe, for as ye prouerbe is, one ſcabbye ſhepe enfecteth a hole flocke, therfore it ſhalbe neceſſary that euery man take hede vnto hym ſelfe, &amp; conſydre all the ſignes &amp; tokens that ſhal be ſayd herafter: for the more care

that he hath about that, the ſoner ſhal he eſcape out of the daunger.
                  And yf a mā feleth hym ſelfe infecte, aboue all thynge let hym remembre god, for it is a ſyckneſſe yt in a twinklīg of an eie may bring a mā to death.
                  Firſte let hym loke whether in hys arme holes, flākes, or vnder his necke there be any apoſteme or ſwellyng, or whether in any other partes of his bodi ther appeare any grene, blacke, or euil coulored ſore, for that is the ſigne that neuer fayleth, but the perſon certaynly is enfected, Notwithſtanding euery man enfected with ye peſtilence hath not ſuch vlcers, botches or ſores, wherefore ye muſte take heede of the other ſignes hereafter, that ye be not deceiued for lacke of ye ſaid apoſtemes. But what is the cauſe yt ſuch apoſtemes ſomtimes doth appeare, &amp; ſometimes doth not? no doubt, but becauſe that whē the venim is ſo vehement &amp; ſo furious, and hath gotten hold in the bodye of man, nature by reaſon of the

ſwyfteneſſe of the infecciō, is ſo troubled, letted, and entangled, that ſhe cā
                     not tell whiche waye to ſuccoure, &amp; ſo can driue out none apoſtemes, &amp; that is more perillous, thē yf ther wer many ſores. But againe, when ye venim is but meanely furious, &amp; the nature of ye pacient ſtrong ynough by reaſon of good humours, thē it defendeth itſelf and driueth the venim from the hert &amp; principall membres, to ſuch places as it may be beſt auoyded at, which breaketh forthe by comuvlſion in botches, carbuncles and other ſores.
                  The ſeconde ſygne is, yf ye feele a greate pryckyng and ſhotyng in youre bodye, and ſpecially in any of the .iii. clenſyng places, yt is to ſay the necke, the armeholes and the flankes.
                  The thyrde ſigne is when ye fele an outragious heate within you, as yf ye were in the fire. Which heat ſomtime ſpreadeth it ſelf abrode through al the hole body, and otherwhyle ther aryſeth ſuche a colde, that it maketh a mā
                     
to ſhake as yf he were in a feuer. Wherin al ye that be infected, muſte take hede: for ſome there be yt in the beginning fele not ſuch a feruēt heate outwardly, but it is within as greate as yf they burned, with moche heuyneſſe of ye head, dryneſſe of ye mouth, &amp; extreme thirſt. Wherby many one are compelled for to ſlepe euen for verye labour of the ſpirytes, and ſome other watch, and are ſo out of quyete that a man wold thynke they were fallen in to a phreneſye.
                  The fourth ſygne is, yf great vapours and fumes ariſe out of the body, when a man is in a bathe, and wolde fayne ſweate, but he can not.
                  The fifth ſigne is yf the paciente can not drawe his breath eaſely, for many one is ſo ſtrayte wynded, that he can not ſpeake, and when he breatheth it is with great laboure and difficultie.
                  The ſixt ſigne is vehemente payne of the heed, ſuche as is wont to be in a freneſy. But there be ſome for al that,

that in the beginning of the infeccion, fele nothīg ſo great peyne as we haue ſpoken of in the heed. Notwithſtanding this is a general rule, yt the peſtilence can not be in the body, without ſome payne, or heuineſſe in the heed▪ The .vii. ſigne is great deſyre to ſlepe, frō ye which many one can not abſtaine him ſelfe in any wiſe, nor can not be kept waking of thē yt are aboute him. The .viii. ſygne is chaungynge of the ſyght, for ſomtimes there commeth to the pacientes eies, as it wer a yelowe colour, ſomtimes al that he beholdeth he thynketh it to be grene.
                  The .ix. ſigne is peine of the mouthe, or an vnnatural taſt, bytter, ſoure, orſtinkinge. The tenthe ſygne is often 
                        •
                     omiting, bitter, &amp; of diuers colours. The .xi. is heuineſſe and dulnes of al the hole body, and ſwownynge, and weakeneſſe of the limmes, Theſe be ye principal ſignes &amp; tokens whereby ye may perceyue whē any mā is infected. Notwithſtandyng all theſe ſignes are

not euer manifeſt, for ſomtymes it is ſene, that one hath had the peſtilence, &amp; felt nothyng at all, yea and ſomtimes the vrine wyl be as fayre and as good to ſight, as in a hole man, becauſe the humours come not at the lyuer, and the feuer wylbe ſmal or none, for that the venime is not in a hote humoure, and ſo driueth out no heate, and yet the pacient by and by dyeth.
                  Somtymes alſo he ſhal thynke hym ſelfe hole, bycauſe that nature in the fyrſte brunt droue the venome from the herte, and yet anon after his lyfe paſſeth from hym, for that nature was not ſtrong ynough at the next aſſult, eyther by reſon it was vexed &amp; weried in the firſte, or els the venime peraduenture multiplied or chaunged into more malignitie or nerer to the herte than it was afore. Euery one in the begynnyng ſeme lightly to be better, for then the ſtrength of nature is gathered al togither to ſtād againſte hys enemye, but it is not ſo in other euyll

ſickeneſſes. The paciente alſo manye tymes thynketh hym ſelfe ſtronge ynoughe, becauſe the venime worketh not ſo cruellye vpon the other mēbres as it doth vpon the herte.
                  Wherfore in time of peſtilence, when ye fele your ſelfe in any thing diſeaſed, dryue not forth ye time in loking whē the ſignes aforeſaid ſhuld appeare, nor ſtande not in examining or doubtyng whether ye be infected or no, for ye maye be ſure, that ſo longe as thys dyſeaſe raigneth in ye country where ye are, ye ſhall haue fewe ſickneſſes, but eyther is peſtilence alreadye, or els wyll be within a whyle: and ſo gyue your ſelfe to ye cure of the Peſtilence, for while the noughty influence of that infecciō dureth, al ſuperfluous humours may lghtly be enfected, and that is the onlye cauſe, why in time of peſtilēce, ther is ſo few of other infirmities. For as ſoone as many ſortes of other ſykneſſes doo ariſe, the peſtilence abateth and is gone.
                  
                     And here is to be noted, that whatſoeuer chyld in the tyme of peſtilence, be vexed with the wormes, ye maye ſafely affirme yt he is infected, for it is a matter ſo diſpoſed to the peſtilence, euen as is brymſtone, to be kindled of the fyre. This haue many phiſicions not conſidered, &amp; bicauſe of that, haue bene deceiued in theyr cure. Here I haue declyned by occaſion, but now to our intent.
                  When one or two, or more of theſe ſygnes aforeſaid are knowē to be in a bodye, let hym not deſpyſe them, nor put any foolyſſh truſt in the ſtrēgth of his cōplexiō, as many one haue done, &amp; by and by dyed, nor let no man truſt ye colour of his vryne, or mouing of the pulſe: for ſomtymes the ſtrength is ſo exceſſyue in the venyme, that a man is deed afore the naturall vertues are able for to ſuccour him, or to dryue awaye the venim from the herte. And herein haue many wiſe phiſicions alſo ben deceyued, and haue euyl iudged of

the pacientes pronoſtyke.
                  Therfore by and by without delaye, ye muſte admynyſtre ſome good and holſome medicine, as ſhalbe ſayd herafter, or elles the ſtylled water that we ſpake of in ye former Chapiter, or ſome other valiaunt medicine againſt the peſtilence, that it may deſcend vnto the hert afore the venyme haue the vpperhande of nature.
                  For yf it bee once ſettled at the hert, I affirme plainely, ther is no hope at al. Yet there be ſome fooles, that tarye tyl the twelueth houre, or the foure &amp; twentye, after the infeccion, and they booſt them ſelues that they wil heale the pacient, but that is a manifeſt &amp; a a ſhameful errour, for yf any by chaūce is ſo recouered, it commeth of God, &amp; not of any medicine, for where as one ſo eſcapeth, an hundred other periſſhe.
                  Notwithſtandyng yf the caſe ſo be that ye be not called, or can gette no remedy afore the ſaid time, caſte not your ſelfe into diſpayre, or put not the

paciēt in diſcomfort, take or giue your medicine in ye name of God, and yf ye can not brooke it, take aſmuch agayn and do ſo many tymes til ye maye retayne it, thē lay ye downe to ſweate, and lyft vp your hert to God, callinge vpon hym, without whom there is no helth, and by the grace of Ieſu, ye nede not to be feareful of death, for that ye is impoſſible to man, is eaſye ynough with God, yea many times nature worketh it ſelfe, aboue al natural expectaciō. But I counſaill at the firſte begynnyng to receyue the medicines, when any of the forſayde ſignes appeareth, or when ye fele your ſelfe diſeaſed, for the venyme perceth ſoner to the herte, of the cholerike, thē either of the ſanguyne or the melancholyke, although the ſanguynes are apter to infeccion, then the other are, chefelye yf the ſyckneſſe be in ſomer.
                  They that are of melancholy be not lyghtly taken, but in caſe they be, thē the cure is very daūgerouſe and hard.
                  
                     Therefore I ſaye take heede at the beginnyng as the prouerbe is. Prīcipiis obſta, ſero medicina paratur Lū mala per longas inualuere moras.
                  Take the medicine quickely, and let thy ſelfe bloud, and remember god the phiſicion of thy ſoule, and withoute doubt, thou ſhalt well inough recouer.
                  Nowe we haue declared the ſignes by whiche ye maye eaſily know whan a perſon is infected, and wee ſayde it was conueniente to take the medicyne as ſoone as anye of them appeareth, without any longer tarying, afore the venime commeth to the hearte, here wee wyll enfourme you, howe ye ſhall perceiue whether the ſaide venime bee ſetled in the hearte or no.
                  Take a dramme of bole armeny made in pouder accordyng to the doctrine of ye laſt chapter in the firſt part, and if ye can not get it, take ſome other excellēt medicine againſt ye peſtilence, namely one of the receites that ſhall bee ſayde hereafter, and geue it to ye pacient, but

there can nothyng be better, then the foreſaide pouder yf ye haue it at hand.
                  Take I ſaye thereof one dramme, &amp; an ounce of white wyne, and odoriferous, with two ounces of water of roſes, mingle them, and geue them to the pacient. The blacke receit declared in the Chapter of preſeruatiues, maye be wel vſed in ſtede of the bole.
                  And yf he maye retayne the drynke within his ſtomake, it is a good ſigne that the venime was not at the hearte afore he toke the medicine, and therefore he may be let bloude wel inough.
                  But yf the pacient cannot broke the ſaide drinke, but caſt it vp and vomite, then ye maye be ſure, that the venyme hath bene at ye heart afore ye medicine.
                  Therfore by and by waſh his mouth with wine, or with water of ſcabious, of ſorel, or of roſes, and it ought to be very wel mundified and clenſed.
                  Then geue hym an other doſe of the ſaid drinke, and heat a cruſte of bread, and holde it to his noſe, that he maye

the better kepe the foreſayd pocion▪ And if the ſeconde tyme he caſte it vp againe, and is not able to reteine it, waſh his mouth as is ſaide before, and geue it him the thyrde tyme, with a litle vineger, that it may perce the better, and ſo .vi. or .vii. times, if he do not holde it, geue it hym agayne, and then whether he retayneth it, or retayneth it not, by and by ye ought to lette hym bloude.
                  But in caſe the paciente were infected xxiiii. houres afore ye geue the drinke, neuer let him bloud, for ye can nothing helpe him, but rather make him feble, but adminiſter a medicine ordeyned for the peſtilence, as is ſayde afore, or ſuch as ſhalbe ſpoken of hereafter, and that done prouoke hym to ſweate.
                  Nowe to oure purpoſe as concernyng dyet.
               
               
                  ¶The ſeconde Chapter, of the cure of peſtilence, by the waye of dyet.
                  
                     
                     FYrſt as ſoone as euer the paciēt feleth himſelfe infected, it is verye good to auoid ye corruptaire, by chaunginge into ſome other place: or els if he can not ſo, let him rectifye the ayre of his own houſe, or of his chamber, with water of roſes and vineger, or els with fumigacions as is ſpoken of before, according to the quality of ye time, &amp; the cōplexion of his own body.
                  Moreouer it is good for him to ſhiften his bedde out of one chamber into another, and from that to the fyrſte agayne the nexte daye, euer rectifying the ayre, of them both, as is aforeſaid.
                  And as touchynge meat and drinke, he ought not to abſtaine, or yet to take anye ſuperfluities, for to eate good meates meaſurablye (thoughe it be againſt his ſtomake) yet in this diſeaſe it ſhall doe him muche good; Let him

eate the brothe of chickens, capons, or coleyſes of rabbettes, and ſuche lyke meates, with a litle ſorell ſauce, or vyneger, &amp; roſewater, or wine of pomegranades, (yf they maye be gotten) or wyne of barberyes, and ſuche other.
                  If ye wyl haue other kynde of ſauces, or a pouder to ſtrowe vpon youre meate, ye may make it after this ſort.
                  Take graynes of paradiſe, whyte dyptanye, of eche an ounce, fine poudre of cinamome, and cloues, of eche halfe an ounce, make them al in pouder, and mingle it with ſuger. In this diſeaſe ye maye eate no queſye meates, as eles, geſe, duckes, and other ſuche as bee euyll.
                  I call them euyll meates, whych (accordyng vnto Galene De differentiis febrium) are eyther euil of theyr owne nature, or els if thei be naturallye good, yet by reaſon of ſome putrefaction, are as muche or more vnholſome, as the other are, partelye ſo, becauſe of longe kepynge, vncleane and

naughty dreſſyng, or when thei be laied vp in a filthye or ſtinking place, and partly by ſome yl infeccion, when thei were aliue: for he that vſeth ſuch kind of meates, is oftentimes accoumbred with manye naughtye ſyckneſſes, as corrupte &amp; peſtilencial feuers, ſcabbes, puſtles, lepries, and other euyll infirmytyes.
                  All fyſhe in this caſe are to be auoided. Brothe or gruell, made with borage, bugloſſe, endiue, ſuccorye, ſorell, purcelane, and other like herbes, with a litle ſaffron, and cleane wheat floure, or the crommes of breade in a broth of chickyns, or without a broth, maye be wel adminiſtred.
                  Potched egges alſo with ſorell ſauce and cinamome, vineger &amp; roſewater, are meruelous good in this caſe.
                  And yf the heate be very vehement, as well after meat, as afore, he maye wel drinke a draughte of ſodden water with the iuyce of orenges, limons, citrons, or of ſowre apples, wel mīgled

together, to quēch ye venimous fumes, that might ryſe vp to the brayne. And yf the paciente be younge, and ſtronge hauyng a good ſtomake, hole winded, hoate of complexion, and in tyme of heate, not ſubiecte to the colike, nor to none hydropſye, nor apoſtomes in the bowelles, he maye drynke a good draughte or twoo of cleare and colde water commynge out of a rocke, or of a runnynge water, or of a faire ſpring. For when nothynge elles can mytygate the thyrſte, yet wyll cleare water by lytle and lytle, dymyniſhe all the heate. But ye muſt beware ye take no greate exceſſe.
                  Aptiſane with ſuger of roſes, is verye good to drinke betwene meales.
                  The pacient oughte not for to ſleape duringe the fyrſte .xxiiii. houres, and in the time yt he receiueth his medicines. Afterward he mai ſlepe a litle at once, to comforte the weakeneſſe of the ſpirites, and he ought euery daye to go to ſyege once.
                  
                     And aboue al other thynges let him not diſpayre, but bidde him be of good comfort, and doubt not of his health, ſo he take no thought, but as much as is poſſible, make him to reioiſe, as wel by communicacion as by muſike, and bringyng in vnto hym good and holeſome herbes, fruites, boughes and other thynges of coumforte, but yet notwithſtanding ſee that he remember God, and notforget his own cōſcience, for in this ſickeneſſe the worſt is euer to be feared.

                  And if ye can not get the foreſaid pouder, or paraduenture ye wil abhorre to take it, thē drink a litle pocion of ye receit folowing, which is very excellēt.

                  But or euer ye lette him blood, it is good to gyue ſome good and holſome medicine agaynſt the venyme, ſuch as is declared in the chapters herbefore.
                  If the botche appeare vnderneth the eares, let him blood in the hed veyne of ye ſame arme, or els in the braunche of the ſame veyne, which is vpon the hand, betwene the myddle fynger and the nexte that is adioynynge,
                  If it appeare vnder the throte, take the ſame veyne, and within a whyle after, it is good to open the .ii. veynes vnderneth the tongue.
                  If the ſore be ſette within the armeholes, take the veyne called me
                        ••
                     ana, whiche is betwene the foreſayd heade veyne, and the veyne commynge from the lyue
                        •
                     .
                  If the ſore be ſette within the ſtankes, than ye muſte open the veyne called ſaphena, whiche is about the ancle

of the fote, on the inner ſide: and yf ye can not fynde it there, take the branch of it, yt is betwene the greate too, and the nexte vnto him, but the lettyng of bloode in that vayne is forbiddē vnto women when they be in healthe.
                  And yf there apere .ii. botches, one on euery ſyde, Manardus gyueth coūcell to take the right ſide and not the left. And in caſe there doth appere no ſigne of botche or ſwellyng, than he biddeth you to open both the veines ſaphenas on the right ſide and the lefte.
                  Notwithſtandynge, Marſilius Ficinus is of a contrarye opinion, and ſayeth that it is beſt when there doth no ſore appere, to take the common veyne on the ryghte arme.
                  I thynke herein Manardus councel rather to be folowed.
                  But yf ye ſe the botche ſtandyng outwarde more towarde the bounche, thā ye muſt open the veyne called ſciatica, whyche is aboute the ancle of the fote on the outſyde. The whiche openynge

of the veines muſte be done as ſone as is poſſible, alwaye preſuppoſed, that he hath receiued one or other medicine agaynſte the venym, and that he ſleape not in any wiſe, as is afore mēcioned.
                  And to them that can not lawfullye be letten blood, ye muſt in all haſt applye many ventoſes, with ſcarificatiō or withoute ſcarifienge, as it ſemethe beſt to your diſcretiō, ſo ye take a reaſonable order thus. If the ſoore be vnder the eares, or about the throte, lette youre ventoſes be applyed behynd vpon the necke.
                  If the botch appeare vnder the armes, ſet your ventoſes behynde vpon the ſhulders. If the ſore be in the flanke, or thyes, lette your ventoſes be ſette vpon the buttockes.
                  And yf the pacient be replete wyth humours and ſtronge, hauing no fluxe nor other impediment, &amp; ye thynke he nedeth to be purged: ye may gyue him in ye mornyng .i. ounce of caſſia, or of māna, with a litle dy aprunis laxatiue

more or leſſe, according to ye pacientes neceſſitie, tempered with water of ſcabiouſe, ſorell, or endiue, euer takynge hede, that he do receiue ſome medicine againſt the venim, during al the time of his diſeaſe.
               
               
                  ¶The fifth Chapiter, of applycation of outward medicines.
                  
                     HEre is to be noted yt no maner plaiſter repercuſſiue, mai be ſet vpō any botch of peſtilēce. But aſſone as is poſſible, after lettinge bloode, it is good to take an onion, &amp; to make an hole in the middeſt of it, thē fil it ful of good triacle, after that ſtoppe it, and ſet it on the harth to roſte, as it were an apple. And when it is roſt ſo longe tylle it be tendre, let it cole a litle: and ſet it hote vpon the botche, and when it hath bene there by the ſpace of two houres, take

it of, and laye an other on.
                  Or take a cocke and pull the fethers of, about his foundamente, &amp; put a litle ſalt in it, and ſet his foundamente vpō the ſaide botche, keping him on a good whyle, ſtoppyng many times his byll, that his breth may be reteyned, &amp; let hym blowe againe. And yf ye cocke dye, it ſhall be good to take another yonge cocke, and ſplytte it quycke aſounder, and lay it on ye botch, but ye muſte cōmaūde them that take them of, to caſt thē in ye fyre, and not to take the ſauor whē it is remoued: for that is verye daūgerous. Some there be yt lay aboute ye ſore, water leches called bloodſuckers, and it is very good, ſo they be well prepared, &amp; clenſed, from corrupciō. Other apply ventoſes with ſcarificatiō, but they ought fyrſt to be applied withouten any ſcarifying, ſo they ſhal ye better drawe ye venym out.
                  Other lay therto a playſter made of galbanū, diaquilō, &amp; armoniake, incorporate togyther, &amp; ſome other lay on it

a plaiſter made of figges, ſoure leuē, &amp; reiſins without kernels, braied &amp; incorporate altogyther in oyle of camomylle. There be alſo yt ſet vpon the botche an herbe called crowefoote, which is very hote, &amp; maketh a bliſter on ye ſkinne, &amp; that ſame they breake, and kepe the place open many dayes after. And in that caſe, yf the botch be in the verye arme holes: it is beſte to ſet ye ſayd herbe a loft vpon the arme.
                  And ſome other breake the forſayde botche with a ſtronge ruptory, hauing part of maturatiō, as for exāple thus. Take ſowre leuen foure ounces, muſtarde, rue, ſcabiouſe, wormewood, of euery one an handfull, white lilly rotes, the thyrde parte of all, grene copporoſe two drammes, cantharides in numbre .x. galbani one ounce, old nuttes, and ſomwhat fuſty, or els newe yf ye can not get them, in nūbre .iiii. oile of white lilles, as moch as ſhal ſuffice, ſeeth al the herbes and rootes in oile, accordyng to arte, with a double veſſel,

that is to ſay: the oyle being in one panne may ſeeth onely by the boiling of the water in an other greate panne, and make a playſter with the reſidue of the ſtuffe in a good fourme. It hath a greate vertue to breake a peſtilence ſore without moch payne, and afore ye lay it on, waſh the ſore with a ſponge dipped in the ſtraynyng of the foreſaid herbes and rotes.
                  Other take oyle olyue &amp; ſeth it with oken aſſhes, addynge vnto it a litle of blacke ſope, &amp; quicke lyme, and make a plaiſter of the ſame, it is not to be vſed, but in ſtrong complexions.
                  And al the forſaid waies are to be cō
                     mended. But after one hath vſed thē a whyle, &amp; ſeyth they begynne to come to maturation, let him take ye counſell of a lerned ſurgeon, or any other of good experience, and to ſet maturatiue emplayſters, vnctions, &amp; bathes, accordyng as becommeth, percing the apoſteme in the ſofteſte place, afterwarde procede with mundificaciō and incarnacion,

euen as in other kindes o fappoſtemes: wherein I humblye deſyre them to haue ſome pytie of the poore, that be diſeaſed, &amp; not to fauoure thē that haue ynough, but rather take ſomoche of the ryche, that they maye the better haue wherwith to helpe ye nedy. And forbycauſe the ſycke maye haue ſome comfort, if in caſe they ſhuld be deſtitute of ſurgeons, I will (beſydes the ſaid medicines whiche they may confidentlye vſe,) deſcribe ſome maturatiue emplayſters that are experte and proued in this cure of peſtilence.
                  
                     ¶A playſter to rype a botche commynge of the peſtilence. TAke mallowes, &amp; the rotes of holyhocke, &amp; onions, aſmuche as ſhal ſuffice, waſhe them and ſeeth them in water, &amp; afterward bray thē in a morter with poudre of

                  And afore that it be thorough rype, cauſe it to be perced as it is ſaid afore. And if after the ſayd percing there be great payne, take the yolke of an egge wel beaten, and a lytle oyle of roſes, &amp; annoynte a tent therin, and put into ye ſore, for to ceaſe the payne. Afterward mundifye the place with a ſalue made of yolkes of egges, fine barly floure, &amp; a lytle hony of roſes. Laſt of al, for the perfecte incarnacion, take the iuyce of

dayſes, and with a lytle waxe make a ſofte oyntmente, and vſe it, or ye maye lay therto any other ſalue incarnatiue as ye are wonte to do in other clene ſores. Prouided alwaye yt it is better in this caſe, to breake yt ſore betymes than to tary for the rypyng long, leſte perchaunce ye venym beyng included, gather ſtrength by the putrefaction, &amp; ſo returne agayne vnto the hart: therfore open it, afore it come to rypyng, &amp; after procede with your maturatiues, and other holſome playſters.
                  THus moche haue I ſpoken of ſurgery, in the exterior cure of one that hath the botch, ſo farre is god hath giuen me vnderſtandinge to perceyue, accordyng to the mindes of ſuch famouſe clerkes, as haue moſt effectually written of the ſame.

                  ¶The .vi. Chapiter, of the cure of carbuncles and anthrax.
                  
                     AS concernyng the curation both of a carbuncle &amp; the peſtilence ſore called anthrax, ye maye doe euerye thynge accordyng as we ſpake afore in the generall cure of the peſtilence, bothe as touchinge diete, medicines agaynſt the venyme, cordialles, laxatiues, blood lettinges, &amp; ventoſes, ye ſhal heale them as ye heale the botch, in al thinges. But as touching lettīge blood, when ye ſe a carbūcle or an anthrax by him ſelfe without apoſte me of ye emunctoryes, be it vpō the necke, or vpon the throte, or the face, or the head, ye muſt let him blood in the head beyne. If it be vpon the ſhoulders, breſtes, or arme or other place aboue ye 
                     
                        •
                     auyl, take the veine called mediana.
                  And yf it be beneth the ſayde places, downe vnto the knees, take the veyne ſaphena, but yf it be on the outſyde of the thygh, take the veyne ſciatica, euer

vpon the ſide that the ſore is on, (as is ſayd afore) conſyderyng the complexion, the ſtrength, the age, and the qualitie of the blood, euen as is ſaid in the chapter of the botch, and likewiſe applye the ventoſes vpon them that can not beare flebothomye.
                  Whyche thynges preſuppoſed, it is good to ſet vpō the carbūcle, whether it be with botch or without botch, the yolke of an egge, incorporate with as much ſalt as ye cā tēper with it, renuyng it euery houre duryng a hole day. Or els apply the ſayd leches or blood ſuckers round aboute the ſore, &amp; after they haue ſucked oute the bloode, ſet theron a cocke as is ſaid of the botch, or els a doue al hote ſplitte in ye middle. And he that can not gette the leches, yet let hym not fayle to applye the reſidue of ye ſayd medicines, euery one after other as afore is ſayde.
                  Or a hote lofe commynge out of the ouen, or take a ſower pomgranad, an

bruſed betwen two ſtones, or the rote of daiſes, or good ſowre dough, incorporate with ſalt and a litle oyle oliue: all theſe medicines are good to kyl the carbuncle.
                  The precious ſtone called a ſaphyre hath alſo great vertue againſt venime and ſpecially againſt a carbuncle, yf ye touche it with the ſtone, and drawe it round about the ſore by the ſpace of an houre. But whatſoeuer medicine ye ſet vnto a carbuncle, ye muſt laye a defenſiue about the ſore, whiche is made as hereafter foloweth.

Take ſanguis draconis, and bole armeni, of ech a like much, make them in pouder and incorporate them wyth oyle of roſes, and a litle vineger, and lay it in a cloth al about the ſore, without touching any part of it, &amp; renew it when it is harde and drye. But yf the perſon be of good abilitie and the carbuncle veri fearce and burning, cannot bee quenched with the meanes aforeſaide,

than ye muſte procede with an actual or potencial cauterie, and to remoue the eſcare, laye on capons grece or a litle butter, or els a playſter made of mallowe leaues, holihokes, violettes, lily rotes ſodden in broth of netes fete or other fleſhe, &amp; afterward ſtamped, ſtreyned, &amp; vpon the fyer mingled with pouder of lineſeede, barly floure, beane floure, freſhe butter, and ſwines grece, adding in the ende whan ye take it of, two yolkes of egges and a litle ſaffron, and ſtyrre it wel about.

            ¶ A declaracion of the veines in mannes bodye, and to what diſeaſes and infirmities the openyng of euery one of them do ſerue.
            
               IT is not vnknowen to anye whiche haue ſeene Anathomies, how ther be in a mans bodye .ii. hyndes of veines, general and ſpeciall.
            Generall or commune veynes are iii. which appeare in the middeſt of euery mannes arme on the inner ſyde, &amp; of them the higheſt is called of learned mē cephalica, or the head beine, and the loweſt of al three, is called commonly

baſilica or regia, in the righte arme by an other name epatica, or the veine of the liuer, but in the left arme, it is called pulmatica, the veine of the longes. The .iii. common veine, lieth betwene the other .ii. in the middes, and is named cordiaca, or the veine of the heart.
            The fyrſt that we dyd ſpeake of, that is to ſaie cephalica, is a veine moſt apt to be letten bloude, in al ye hyer partes of mannes body, and is opened for the head ache, and the eyes.
            This veine yf by chaunce ye touche it, and yf it blede not at the fyrſt ſtroke ye may be bold to ſtrike it once again, for there is no ieopardye of cutting of anye muſcle. And yf ye cannot finde it out, take hys hraunche that is aboute the thombes ende.
            The veine epatica, emptyeth from the middle partes of al the body, and it is euer opened againſt diſeaſes of the ſtomake, and ye ſplene, but ye ought therin to be very dilygent, that there be no muſcule perced.
            
               If ye can not ſpie it in the arme, ſeke the braunche of it betwen the litle finger and the fourth.
            The cordiaca veine draweth bloud as wel from beneth, as from aboue, for it is cōpouned of cephalica and epatica. If any feleth a weakenes at his heart, he ought to take good hede that he bee not opened in yt veine cordiaca, but yf neceſſitye be of bleding, let him blede in the cephalica or els mediana.
            So likewiſe of the other .ii. The cordiaca, is good to cure the paſſions of al the hole bodye, whan they doe procede of heate, ſpecially of the hearte and of the longes.
            But in the percing of it, ye muſte excedyngly beware, for vnder it is a certain muſcle, which if it bee very depelye cutte, the pacient is in ieopardy of his lyfe.
            When ye entend to let a perſon bloud in any veine, ye muſte bathe the arme wherin ye perce, in good hote water, &amp; draw ye hole abrod, yt the groſſe bloude

may the more eaſily paſſe. And here is to be noted, that in all ſickeneſſes and times (except only infeccion of ye peſtilence) ye muſte take the ſame veyne of the .iii. that doth appeare fuller &amp; bigger thā ye other are, for by that ye may perceiue that the members which belonge vnto it, are full of ſuperfluityes of to hote bloud, and this ſhal be ſuffycient of the foreſayde veynes general: now we wil reherce ye veines ſpeciall. ¶The veine in the higher parte of the forehead, is good to be opened ī al diſeaſes of the heade, &amp; of the braine, ſpecially yf they be of long continuaunce, and it cureth the newe begonne lepry. ¶The .ii. veines that are behinde the eares, are opened to preſerue ye memory, mundify the face, and to take away rumes and diſtillacions from ye head, and are good generallye in all diſeaſes of the mouth, and of the gummes. ¶The .ii. veines of the temples of the head, are good to voide humours from the eyes, and they ſerue alſo for al diſeaſes

of the eares.
            The .ii. veines in the corners of the iyes are opened in the cure of webbes, ſpottes, cloudes, miſtes, perles, rednes, cornes, and other infirmityes and weakeneſſe of the ſyght.
            The .ii. veines in the holowneſſe of the eares, ſerue to heale the ſhaking of the heade, ſwymminge of the eyes, doſines, ſounding of the eares, new deafnes, and vnclennes of the mouth.
            The veine in the tippe of the noſe, is good againſte apoſtemes of the heade, reumes, and fluxes of the iyes, it pourgeth the brain, and comforteth the memorye.
            This veine muſt bee ſoughte verye wyſely, for it lyeth depe, therfore he yt wyl be ſure of it, ſhall fynde it euen in the verye middes betwene the twoo ſides of the noſe ende.
            The two veines within the noſethrilles, are opened againſt the heauynes of the head.
            The veine of the lippes, is good to

take in al diſeaſes of the mouth.
            The .ii. veines within the mouth, are opened ī diſeaſes of ye head, toth ache, payne of the iawes, mouth and throte, and agaynſt frecles of the face.
            The foure veines in the palate of the mouth, are good to bee opened in the toth ache, reuines and catarres of the heade.
            The two veines in the hynder part of the head, are good againſt the phreneſye, ſwimming, aſtonying, and al other paines of the heade.
            The .ii. veines vnderneth the tong are opened againſt the fluxes of the heade, palſies, quincies, ſcrophules, apoplexia, cough, paines of the mouth, teeth, &amp; gummes, againſt impedimentes of the ſpeche, and generally in all diſeaſes of the breaſt, hearte, longes and arteries. The veyne that is betwene the chyn, and the nether lip, is good to open in curyng of a ſtynkyng breath.
            The veine that lieth ryght vnderneth the chynne, is good agaynſte theſame

diſeaſe, and alſo in diſeaſes of the head &amp; of the breaſte, polipus in ye noſe, paines of the chekes, ſtinking of the noſethriles, ſcrophules and ſpottes aboute the face. The .ii, veines of ye necke (one afore, another behynde) are excedynge good againſt the pleureſie, newe lepry, ſhakynge of the members, humours, and diſtillacions of the heade, and to muche ſtyfneſſe of lymmes.
            The .ii. veines vnder the arme holes, ſerue againſt ye ſtraitnes of the breaſt, payne of the mydryfe, and the longes, and agaynſt difficultye of breathyng, called aſthma.
            The two veynes aboue the elbowes are taken in all diſeaſes of the breaſt, ſwymmyng of the heade, ſpaſme, and epilepſia, commonly called the falling euyll. Vena purpurea, or the purple veine liyng in the ryght arme nexte epatica, toward the hande, is opened againſt diſeaſes of ſpirituall members, and of the bowels.
            The veyne illiaca nexte vnto the purple

               TO begyn a treatyſe of ye cure of childrē, it ſhoulde ſeme expedient, yt we ſhould declare ſomwhat of the principles, as of the generacion, the beyng in the womb, the tyme of procedynge, the maner of the byrthe, the byndynge of the nauyl, ſettynge of the members, lauatoryes, vnctions, ſwathinges, and entreatementes, with the cyrcumſtaunces of theſe &amp; many other: which if I ſhoulde reherſe in particles, it woulde requyre both a longer tyme, and encreaſe into a greater volume. But foraſmuch as the moſt of theſe thinges are very trite &amp; manifeſt, ſome pertainyng only to the office of a midwyfe, other for the reuerence

of the matter not mete to be diſcloſed to euery vyle perſon: I entende in this booke to let them all paſſe, and to treat onely of the thinges neceſſary, as to remoue the ſickneſſes, wherwith the tender babes are oftētimes afflicted, and deſolate of remedye, for ſomuche as manye doe ſuppoſe that ther is no cure to be miniſtred vnto thē, by reaſon of theyr weakenes. And by that vayne opinion, yea rather by a fooliſhe feare, they forſake manye that myghte be well recouered, as it ſhall appeare by the grace of god hereafter, in thys lytle treatyſe, when we come to declaracion of the medicines. In the meane ſeaſon for confinitye of the matter, I entend to write ſomewhat of ye nourc

            For that deuine Poet being throughly expert in ye priuities of nature, vnderſtode ryght wel how great an alteracion euery thynge taketh of the humoure, by the whyche it hath his alymente and nouriſhinge in the youthe
                  •
                whiche thynge alſo was conſidred &amp; alleged of many wyſe Philoſophers: Plato, Theophraſtus, Xenophon, Ariſtotle, and Plinie, who dydde all aſcribe vnto the nourcement as moch effect or more, as to the generacyon. And Phauorinus the Philoſopher (as wryteth Aulus gelius) affirmeth yt yf lambes be nouryſhed with ye milke of

goates, they ſhall haue courſe wolle, like the heare of goates: and yf kiddes in lyke maner ſucke vpō ſhepe, ye heare of them ſhalbe ſoft lyke wolle. Wherby it doth appeare, that the mylke and nouryſhyng hath a marueylous effecte in chaunging the complexiō, as we ſe likewiſe in herbes and in plantes, for let the ſeed or ympes be neuer ſo good &amp; pure, yet yf they be put into an vnkynde earth, or watred with a noughty and vnholſome humour, either they come not vp at al, or els they wyll degenerat and turne out of theyr kinde,

Wherfore as it is agreing to nature, ſo is it alſo neceſſarye &amp; comly for the own mother to nource the own child. Whiche yf it maye be done, it ſhal be moſt cōmendable and holſome, yf not ye muſt be well aduiſed in taking of 
                  •
               
               nource,

not of yll complexion and of worſe maners: but ſuch as ſhal be ſobre, honeſte and chaſte, well fourmed, amyable and chearefull, ſo that ſhe may accuſtome the infant vnto myrth, no dronkard, vyeyous nor ſluttyſſhe, for ſuche corruptethe the nature of the chylde.
            But an honeſt woman (ſuche as had a man chyld 
                  •
               aſt afore,) is beſt not within two monethes after her delyueraunce, nor approchyng nere vnto her time againe. Theſe thinges oughte to be cōſidred of euery wyſe perſon, that wyll ſet theyr children out to nource. Moreouer, it is good to loke vpon the milke, and to ſe whether it be thicke &amp; groſſe, or to moch thinne and watrye, blackyſſhe or blewe, or enclynyng to redneſſe or yelowe, for all ſuche are vnnaturall and euyll. Likewiſe whē ye taſte it in your mouthe, yf it be eyther bytter, ſalte, or ſoure, ye may we

                perceyue it is vnholſome.
            That mylke is good, that is whyte

and ſweete, and when ye droppe it on your nayle, and do moue your finger, neyther 
                  •
               eteth abrod at euery ſtering, nor wyll hange faſte vpon your naile, whē ye turne it downeward, but that whyche is betwene bothe is beſte. Somtime it chaunceth that the milke waſteth, ſo that ye nource can not haue ſufficiente to ſuſteine the child, for the which I wil declare remedies leauing out the cauſes for breuitie of time.
            
               ¶Remedies appropriate to ye encreaſyng of mylke in the breſtes. PAſneppe rootes, and fenelle rootes, ſoddē in broth of chickens, &amp; afterward eaten with a litle freſſhe butter, maketh encreaſe of mylke within the breſtes.

               Ryce alſo ſodden in cowes mylke, with the cromes of white breed, fenell ſeede in pouder, and a litle ſugre is excedyng good.
            
               ¶An other good medicine for the ſame. Take Criſtall, and make it in fyne pouder, and myxe it with aſmoche fenell ſeede and ſuger, and vſe to drinke it warme with a litle wyne.
            A playſter for the encreaſe of milke.

            Theſe thynges haue propertie to augment the mylke, dylle, anyſe ſeede, fenelle, criſtal, horehounde, freſh cheſe, honye, lettuſe, beetes, myntes, carette rootes, parſneppes, the dugges or ydder of a cowe or a ſhepe, gootes milke, blaunched almondes, ryce porrigge, a cowes toung dryed and made in pouder,

poched egges, ſaffron, and the iuce of roſted veale dronken.
            Thus moche of the nource, and of the mylke: nowe wil I declare the infirmities of children.
            Althoughe (as affirmeth Plinie,) there be innumerable paſſions &amp; diſeaſes, wherunto the bodye of man is ſubiecte, and as well maye chaunce in the yonge as in the olde: Yet for moſt commonly the tender age of children is chefely vexed &amp; greued with theſe diſeaſes folowyng.

               ¶Of ſcabbyneſſe and ytche.
SOmetyme by reaſon of exceſſe of heate, or ſharpeneſſe in the milke, throughe the nourſes eatyng of ſalt &amp; eygre meates, it happenethe that a chylde is ſene full of ytche by rubbing, fretyng, and chafyng of it ſelfe, encreſyng a ſcabbe called of the Grekes Pſora: whyche thynge alſo chaunceth vnto many after they be weaned, procedinge of ſalte and aduſte humoures, the cure wherof dyfferethe in none other, but according to the difference of age, for in a ſucking babe ye medicines may not be ſo ſharpe, as it may be ſuffered in one that is alredye weaned. Againſt ſuche vnkinde ytche, ye maye make an oyntment thus. Take water of betony .ii. good handfulles, dayſye leaues, &amp; alehofe otherwyſe called tūnour or ground yuye, of eche one handfull, the red docke rotes, two or thre, ſtampe them al togyther, and grinde them wel, then mingle thē with freſſhe greſe, and againe ſtampe

them. Let them ſo ſtande .viii. daies to putrifye tyll it be hore, then frye them out and ſtrayne them and kepe it for the ſame entent.
            Thys oyntment hath a greate effecte, both in yong and olde, and that without repercuſſion or dryuing backe of the matter, whyche ſhoulde be a peryllouſe thyng for a yong chld.
            The herbe water betonye alone, is a greate medicyne to quenche al vnkind heates without daūger, or the ſething of it in cleare well water, to annoynte the membres. It is a commen herbe, &amp; groweth by ryuers ſydes &amp; ſmal renning waters, and wette places, aryſīg many tymes the heygth of a mā out of the grounde, where he reioyſeth, with a ſtalke foure ſquare, and many braū
               ches on euery ſyde, and alſo it beareth a whytyſh blewe flowre very ſmal, &amp; in harueſt it hath innumerable ſeedes, blacke, and as fyne as the ſeed of tutſone or leſſe, the leues bygge and lōg, accordyng to the ground, ful of iuyce,

iagged on the ſides lyke a ſawe, euen as other betonye, to whom it approcheth in figure, &amp; obtemeth his name of water betony. The ſauoure of the leafe is ſomwhat heauye, moſte lyke to ye ſauoure of elders or walwort, but when it is bruſed it is more pleaſaūt, whych thyng induceth me to vary frō the myndes of them that thynke this herbe to be Galiopſis in Dioſcorides, wrytten of hym that it ſhulde ſtynke when it is ſtamped, but the more this herbe is ſtamped, the more ſwete and herbelyke it ſauoureth: therfore it can not be galeopſis: and beſides that, it is neuer founde in drye and ſtony groūd as the Galiopſis is. Neyther is thys herbe mencyoned of the newe or olde authours, as farre as I can ſee, but of only Vigo, ye famous ſurgion of oure tyme in Italye, whych wryteth on it, that this herbe exceadeth al other in a malo mortuo (ſo calleth he a kynde of 
                  •
               eprye elephantyk, or an vniuerſal &amp; fylthy ſcabbe of all the body:) and in

lyke maner he ſayeth it is good for to cure a canker in the breaſtes. Ye maye reade theſe thīges in his ſecond boke. Capitul .iii. and his fifte booke of the Frenche pockes, in the thyrd chapter: where he doth deſcribe thys aforeſaid herbe, with ſo manyfeſte tokens, that no mā wil doubt it to be water betony, conferryng the boke and the herbe duly togither. Moreouer he nameth in Italye a brydge where it growethe in the water in greate aboundaunce, and is called of yt nacion Alabeueratore, which in dede the Italtons that come hyther and knowe both the place and the herbe, doe affyrme playnely, it is our water betony.
            And where as he allegeth Dioſcorides in climeno, which by cōtemplaciō of both hath but ſmal affiniti or none with this herbe, it was for nothinge els but lack of the tōges, which faute is not to be ſo highly rebuked in a mā of his ſtudy, applying him ſelfe more in the practyſe of ſurgery, &amp; to handye

operaciō, wherin in dede he was nere incomparable, then he did to ſearch ye variaūce of tonges, &amp; rather regarded to declare ye operaciō of thinges with truthe, then to diſpute vpon the propertyes or names with eloquence.
            Thus haue I declyned agayne from my matter, partly to ſhewe ye deſcripcion of thys holeſome herbe, partelye to ſatiſfie the mindes of ye ſurgions in Vigo, whiche haue hitherto redde the ſayd places in vayne, and furthermore bicauſe ther is yet none that declareth manyfeſtly the ſame herbe.
            
               ¶An other remedye for ſcabbes and ytche. Take the rootes of dockes, and frye thē in freſh greſe, then put to it a quā
               titie of brimſtone in pouder, and vſe to rubbe the places twiſe or thriſe a day. Brimſtone poudred &amp; ſouped in a rere egge healeth the ſcabbes, which thing is alſo very good to deſtroye wormes.
            
               ¶A goodly ſwete ſope for ſcabbes and ytche. 
               Take whyte ſope halfe a pounde, and ſtepe it in ſuffyciente roſewater, til it be wel ſoked, then take two drammes of mercinye ſublymed, diſſolue it in a lytle roſewater, labour the ſope and ye roſewater wel together, &amp; afterward put in it a litle muſke or cyuette, and kepe it. This ſope is exceding good to cure a great ſcabbe or ytche, and that without perill, but in a chylde it ſhall ſuffyce to make it weaker of the mercurye.
            
               An other approued medicine for ſcabbyneſſe and ytche. Take fumyterrie, docke rootes, ſcabiouſe, &amp; the roote of walwort, ſtampe them al, &amp; ſet thē in freſh grece to putrifye, then frye them and ſtrayne thē, in which lycour ye ſhal put turpētine a lytle quantitie, brymſtone, and frā
               kenſence very fynely poudred and ſifted a porciō, and with ſufficient waxe make an ointment on a ſofte fyre: this is a ſinguler remedy for the ſame purpoſe. But ī this cure ye ought to gyue

the chylde no egges, nor any eygre or ſharpe meate, and the nurſe alſo muſte auoyde the ſame, and not to wrappe it in to hoote, and yf nedde be, to make a bathe of fumitorye, centaurye, fetherfewe, tanſie, wormwood, and ſauge alone, yf ye ſe the cauſe of the ytche or the ſcabbe to be wormes in ye ſkinne, for a bytter decoecion ſhal deſtroy thē and dry vp the moiſtures of the ſores.
            
               Of diſeaſes in the eares. MAny diſeaſes happen in the eares, as payne, apoſtemes ſwellynges, tynklynge and ſoūd in the heed, ſtoppinge of the organes of hearynge: Water, wormes, &amp; other infortunes gotten into the eares, wherof ſome of them are daungerous and harde to be cured, ſome other expelled of nature without medicyne.
            
               ¶Remedye for payne in the eares. For payne in the eares wythout a manifeſt cauſe, as often chaunceth, it is a ſinguler remedye to take the cheſt

wormes, that are found vnder barkes of trees, or in other ſtumpes in the groūd &amp; wil turne round like a peaſe, take of them a good quantytye, and ſeeth them in oyle, in the rynde of a pomegranarde on the hote ymbres, yt it brenne not, and after that ſtraine it and put into the eares a droppe or two luke warme, and then lette him lye vpon the other eare, and reſte. Ye maye gyue thys to al ages, but in a child ye muſte put a very lytle quantitie.
            
               ¶An other. The hame or ſkynne of an adder or a ſnake, that ſhe caſteth, boiled in oile, &amp; dropped into the eares, eaſeth ye paine, &amp; it is alſo good for an eare that mattereth mingled with a litel hony, and put in luke warme. It is alſo good to droppe into the eares the iuyce of organye and mylke.
            
               ¶For ſwellyng vnder the eares. Paynters oyle, which is oyle of lyneſeed, is excedyng good for ye ſwellyng

of the eares, and for paine in the eares of all cauſes.
            Item a plaiſter made of lineſeede and dille, with a litle duckes greſe &amp; hony, Yf ye ſe the apoſteme breke, &amp; renne, ye may clenſe it with the iuce of ſmallach, the white of an egge, barly flour, and hony, which is a common plaiſter to mundifye a ſore.
            When the eares haue receiued water or any other licour, it is good to take and ſtampe an onion and wryng out ye iuce with a litle goſegreſe, &amp; droppe it hote into the eare as it may be ſuffred, and laye hym downe on the contrarye ſyde an houre, after that cauſe hym to neſe yf his age will ſuffre, with a litle pellitorie of Spayne, or neſinge pouder, and then enclyne his eare downewarde, that the water maye iſſue.
            
               ¶For wormes in the eares. Take myrre, aloes, and the ſeede of colocinthis, called coloquintida of the apothecaries, a quantity of eche, ſeeth thē in oile of roſes, &amp; put a litle ī ye eare

Myrre hath a great vertue to remoue the ſtenche that is cauſed in the eares by any putrefaction, and the better with oyle of bitter almons, or ye may take ye iuce of wormwood with honye and ſalte peter.
            
               ¶For wynde in the eares and tinklyng. Take myrre, ſpykenarde, cumyne, dylle, and oyle of camomyl, and put a droppe in ye eares. They that haue not al theſe maye take ſome of them, and applye it accordyng to diſcretion.
            To amende deafneſſe ye ſhal make an ointment of an hares galle, and the greſe or droppyng of an ele, which is a ſouerayne thyng to recouer hearynge.
            
               ¶Of neſyng out of meaſure. 
               WHen a chylde neſeth out of meaſure, yt is to ſaye, with a longe continuaunce, and therby the braine and vertues animal be febled, it is good to ſtoppe it, to auoyde a further inconuenience.
            
               Wherfore ye ſhal annoynt the heade wyth the iuyce of purcelane, ſorel, and nyghtſhade, or ſome of them, and make a playſter of the whyte of an egge, and the iuyce, with a litle oyle of roſes, &amp; emplayſter the forhead and temples, with the mylke of a woman, oyle of roſes, and vynegre a lytle.
            If it come of cold reume, ye ſhall make a playſter of maſtyke, frankenſens, myrre, wine, and applye it to ye former parte of the head. A fume of the ſame receyued in

               axe, and layed vpon the chyldes head, is holſome.
            
               ¶Breedyng of teeth. 
               ABout ye ſeuēth moneth, ſomtime more, ſomtyme leſſe after ye byrth, it is natural for a chyld for to breede teeth, in which time many one is ſore bered, with ſōdry diſeaſes &amp; peines, as ſwelling of ye gummes &amp; iawes, vnquiete cryeng, feuers, crampes, palſies,

               tuxes, reumes, and other infirmities, ſpecially whā it is lōg or ye teeth come

forth, for the ſoner they apere, the better, and the more eafe it is to ye childe. There be diuers thinges ye are good to procure an eaſy breeding of teeth, among whom the chiefeſt is to annoint the gummes, with the braynes of an hare, myxte with aſmuch capons grece and hony, or any of theſe thynges alone, is exceadynge good to ſupple the gummes and the ſynewes.
            Alſo it is good to waſſhe the chylde two or three tymes, in a weeke, with warme water, of the decoccion of camomyll, hollyhocke and dylle.
            Freſh butter, with a litle barly flour, or honye, with the fine pouder of frā
               kinſence &amp; liquirice, are commēded of good authoures for the ſame entente. And whan the peyne is greatte, and intollerable, with apoſteme or inflāmmacion of the goummes, it is good to make an ointmēt of oile of roſes, with the iuyce of morelle, otherwiſe called nyghtſhade, and in lacke of it, annoint the

               awes within, with a litle freſſhe

butter and honye.
            For lacke of the hares brayne, ye may take the conyes, for they be alſo of the kynde of hares, and called of Plinye Daſypodes, whoſe mawes are of the ſame effecte in medicine, or rather more, than is written of authoures, of the mawes of hares.
            If ye ſe the gummes of the chylde to apoſteme or ſwelle with ſofte fleſſhe, full of matter and paynefull, the beſte ſhal be to annoint the ſore place with the brayne of an hare, &amp; capons grece, equally myxt togither, and after that ye haue vſed thys, ones or twiſe, annoynte the gummes, and apoſtemacions with honye.
            Thyrdlye yf this helpe not, take turpentyne myxte with a litle hony in equal porcion: And make a bath for the head of the chylde, in this fourme. Take the floures of camomylle and dyl, of eche an handful, ſeeth them in a quarte of pure rennyng water, vntil they be tender, and waſſhe the head afore

any meate, euerye mornyng, for ſe pourgeth the ſuperfluytye of the braynes, through the ſeames of the ſkull, and wythdraweth humours from the ſore place, fynally cōforteth ye braine and al the vertues animal of the child. To cauſe an eaſie breedyng of teethe, many thīges are reherſed of auctours beſydes the premiſſes, as the fyrſt caſt tooth of a colte ſet in ſyluer &amp; borne, or redde coralle in lyke maner, hanged about the necke, wher vpon the chylde ſhuld oftentimes labour his gummes, and many other lyke, whyche I leaue out at this time, to auoide tediouſnes, onely content to declare this of coral, that by conſent of al authours, it reſiſteth the force of lyghtenyng, helpeth the chyldren of the fallynge euyll, and is verye good to be made in pouder, &amp; dronken agaynſt al maner of bleeding of the noſe or fundament.

               ¶Remedies for the canker in the mouth of children. 
               TAke drye redde roſes, &amp; violettes, of eche a lyke quantity, make them in pouder, and myxt them with a lytle honye, thys medicine is verye good in a tender ſuckynge childe, and many times healeth alone, without any other thing at al. But yf ye ſe there be great heat &amp; burning in the ſore, with exceding paine, ye ſhal make a iuice of

purcelane, lettuſe &amp; nightſhade, &amp; waſh the ſore wyth a fyne pyece of ſylke, or driue it in with a ſpoute, called of the ſurgions a ſprynge.
            This by the grace of God, ſhall abate the brennyng, aſwage the peyne, and kyl the venime of the vlcer.
            But yf ye ſee the canker yet encreaſe with great corrupciō &amp; matter, ye ſhal make an oyntmente after this maner.
            Take mirre, galles wherewith they make ynke, or in defaute of them, oken apples dryed, frankinſence, of eche a lyke much, of the blacke buries growynge on the bramble, taken from the buſhe while they be grene, the .iii. part of al the reſt, make them al in pouder, and mixt them with aſmuch hony and ſaffron, as is ſufficient, and vſe it.
            
               ¶A ſtronger medicine for the canker in the mouth of children. Take the roote of celidonye dryed, the rinde of a pomegranate, redde corall in pouder, &amp; the pouder of a hartes horne, of eche a lyke, roche alume a litle.

Fyrſte waſhe the place wyth wyne, or warme water, and hony, and afterwarde putte on the foreſayd pouder, very fyne and ſubtyle.

Moreouer ſome write yt chriſtal made in fyne pouder, hath a ſinguler vertue to deſtroie the canker, and in lyke maner the pouder of an hartes horne brēt with aſmuche of the rinde of a pomegranade, and the iuyce of nyghtſhade, is very good and holſome.
            
               Of quinſye and ſwellyng of the throte. THe quinſy is a daūgerous ſicknes, both in young &amp; olde, called in latin angina, it is an inflammacion of the necke with ſwellyng and greate peyne, ſometyme it lyeth in the verye throte, vpon the weſaunt pype, and than it is exceding perillous for it ſtoppeth the breath, &amp; ſtranguleth the paciente anone.
            Other whyles it breaketh oute like a bonche on the one ſyde of the necke, and than alſo with verye great dyffycultye of breathynge, but it choketh not ſo ſone as the fyrſt doeth, and it is more obediente to receiue curacion. The ſignes are apparaunt to ſyghte, &amp;

beſides that the chylde can not crye, neyther ſwallow downe his meat and drynke without payne.
            
               ¶Remedye. It is good to annoynt the griefe with oyle of dyll, or oyle of camomyll, and lylies, and to laye vpon the head, hote cloutes dipte in the waters of roſemary, lauender, and ſauery.
            The chiefeſt remedy commended of authours in this outragious ſickenes, is the pouder of a ſwallow brent wyth fethers and all, and myxte with hony, whereof the paciente muſte ſwallowe downe a litle, and the reſte annoynted vpon the payne. They prayſe alſo the pouder of the chyldes dunge to the chyld, and of a man to a man, brente in a pot, and annointed with a litle hony. Some make a compouned oyntmente of both, the receite is thus. ℞. of the ſwallow brent, one porcion, of the ſecond pouder another, make it ī a thicke fourme with hony, and it wyll endure longe for the ſame entent,
            
               Item an other experiment for the quinſy and ſwellynge vnder the eares.
            Take the muſherun that groweth vpon an elder tree, called in englyſh, Iewes eares (for it is in dede croncled and 
                  •
               at, muche lyke an eare) heat it agaynſt the fyer, and put it hote in anye drinke, theſame drinke is good &amp; holeſome for the quinſye.
            Some hold opinion that whoſo vſeth to drinke with it, ſhall neuer bee troubled with this diſeaſe, and therefore carye it about with them in iorneys.
            
               ¶Of the cough. THe cough in children for ye moſt part, procedeth either of a cold, or by reaſon of reumes, deſcending from the head into ye pipes of the longes or the breaſte, and that is moſt commonly by ouermuche aboundaunce of milke, corruptyng the ſtomake and brayne: therefore in that caſe, it is good to fede the chylde wyth a more ſlender dyete, and to annoynte

the head ouer, with hony, and now and than to preſſe his toungue wyth youre fynger, holdyng downe hys heade that the reumes may iſſue, for by yt meanes the cauſe of the cough ſhall runne oute of his mouthe, and auoyde the chylde of many noughty and ſlimy humours: whiche done, many tymes the paciente am endeth, wythout any further helpe of medicine.
            
               ¶For the cough in a chylde. Take gumme arabike, gumme dragagant, quince ſedes, liquirice and peridies, at the pothecaries, break them al together, and geue the childe to ſuppe a litle at once, with a draught of milke newli warme, as it commeth from the cowe.
            Alſo ſtampe blaunched almons, and wringe them out with the iuyce of fenell, or water of fenell, and geue it to the chylde to fede with a litle ſuger.
            
               ¶Againſt the great cough, and heate in the bodye. The heades of whyte poppye, and

gumme dragagant, of eche a litle much, long cucumer ſeedes, as muche as al, ſeth them in whaye, wyth rayſons and ſuger, and lette the chylde drynke of it twyſe or thryſe a daye luke warme, or colde.
            
               ¶Of ſtraytneſſe of wynde. 
               AGainſt the ſtraitneſſe of breathyng whiche is no quinſie, the conſente of authours do attribute a great effecte, to lyueſede made in pouder, &amp; tempered with hony, for the chylde to ſwallowe downe a lytle at once. I find alſo yt the mylke of a mare newly receiued of ye chyld with ſuger, is a ſiguler remedy for ye ſame purpoſe, Which thing moreouer, is excedynge holeſome to make the belly laxe without trouble.
            
               ¶Of weakenes of the ſtomake, and vomitynge. 
               MAni times the ſtomake of the child is ſo feble that it cānot retain eyther meat or drinke, in which caſe, and for al debilitye therof, it is verye good, to waſhe the ſtomake, with warme water of roſes, wherein a litle muſke hathe beene diſſolued, for that by the odour and natural heate geueth a comfort to all the ſpirituall members.
            And then it is good to roſt a quince tender, &amp; with a litle pouder of cloues and ſuger to geue it to the child: to eat cōſerua quīces, with a litle cinamome and cloues, is ſynguler good for theſame entent. Alſo ye may make a iuice of quinces and geue it to the chylde to drinke with a litle ſuger.
            
               ¶An oyntmente for the ſtomake. Take gallia muſcata at the pothecaries .xx. graine weight, myrrhe a verye litle, make it vp in oyntment fourine, with oyle of maſtike, and water of roſes ſufficient, this is a very good ointment

for the ſtomake.
            
               ¶An other ſinguler receit. Take maſtike, frankinſence, and drye redde roſes, as muche as is ſufficient, make them in pouder, and temper thē vp, with the iuyce of mintes, and a ſponful of vineger, and vſe it.
            
               ¶An other. Take wheat floure, and parche it on a panne, tyll it begynne to brenne and waxe redde, than ſtampe it with vineger, and adde to it, the yolkes of two
                  •
                egges harde roſted, maſtike, gumme, &amp; frankinſence ſufficient, make a plaiſter and laye it to the ſtomake.
            To recouer an appetite loſt.
            Take a good handfull of ranke and luſtye rewe, and ſeth it in a pint of vyneger to the thyrde parte or leſſe, and make it very ſtronge, wherof yf it be a chylde, ye may take a tooſte of brown bread, and ſtampe it with the ſame vyneger, and laye it plaiſterwyſe to the ſtomake, and for a ſtronger age beſides the plaiſter, lette hym ſuppe morning

and euenyng of theſame vineger. This is alſo good to recouer a ſtomak loſt, by comming to a fyer after a long iourneye, and hath alſo a ſinguler vertue to reſtore a man that ſwowneth.
            
               ¶An experiment often approued of Raſis for the vomite of chyldren. Raſis a ſolemne practicioner amonge phiſicions, affyrmeth that he healed a great multitude of this diſeaſe, onelye with the practiſe folowinge, whiche he taketh to bee of great effect in all lyke eaſes.
            Fyrſt he maketh as it were an electuarye of pothecarye ſtuffe, that is to ſaye, lignum aloes, maſtike of euerye one half a dramme, galles half a ſcruple, make a lectuary with ſyrupe of roſes, and gallia muſcata and ſuger.
            Of this he gaue the children to eat a very litle at once &amp; often. Afterwarde he made a plaiſter thus. ℞, maſtike, aloes, ſloes, galles, frankenſence, and brent bread, of ech a like porcion, make

a plaiſter with oile and ſirupe of roſes to be laid to the childes ſtomake ho

               ¶An other oyntment for the ſtomake, deſcribed of Wilhel. Placentino. Take oyle of maſtike or of wormewood .ii. ounces, waxe .iii. ounces, cloues, macis, and cinamome of eche thre drammes, make an oyntment, adding in the ende a litle vineger.
            The yolke of an egge hard roſted, maſtyke, frankinſence and gumme, made in a playſter with oyle of quinces, is excedyng good for the ſame purpoſe.
            
               Of yeaxing or hicket 
               IT chaunceth oftētymes that a chyld yeaxeth out of meaſure. Wherfore it is expedient to make the ſtomake eigre afore it be fed, &amp; not to repleniſh it wyth to much at once, for this dyſeaſe cōmonly procedeth of fuines, for yf it come of emptines, or of ſharp humors in the mouth of the ſtomake, which is

               Of colike and rumblyng in the guttes. PEine in the belly is a common diſeaſe of children, it commeth either of wormes, or of taking cold, or of euyl mylke, yt ſignes thereof are to well knowen, for the chylde cannot reſt, but cryeth and fretteth it ſelfe, and manye tymes cannot make theyr vryne, by reaſon of winde, that oppreſſeth the necke of the bladder,

and is knowen alſo, by the member in a manne chylde, which in thys caſe, is alwaye ſtiffe, &amp; pricking, moreouer the noyſe and rumblinge in the guttes, hither and thyther, declareth ye chylde to be greued, with winde in the belly, and colike.
            
               ¶Cure. The nourſe muſte auoyde all maner meates, that engēder wind, as beanes peaſon, butter, harde egges, and ſuche.
            Than waſhe the childes bellye with hote water wherein hath bene ſodden comine, dyll and fenel, after that make a playſter of oyle and waxe, and clappe it hote vpon a cloth vnto the belly.
            
               An other good playſter for theſame entent. Take good ſtale ale and freſhe butter, ſeeth them with an handfull of comine poudred, and after put it all together into a ſwines bladder, &amp; bynde the mouth faſte, that the licoure yſſue not out, then wind it in a cloth, &amp; turne it vp and doune vpon the belly as hote

            Remedy for the fluxe in a chylde.
            Firſt make a bath of herbes that doe reſtrayne, as of plantaine, ſaint Iohns weede called ipericon, knotgraſſe, burſa paſtoris and other ſuche, or ſome of them, and vſe to bath him in it as hote as he mai wel ſuffer, then wrap him in with clothes, and laye hym downe to

ſlepe.
            And yf ye ſe by this twiſe or thryſe vſing, that the belly bee not ſtopped: Ye maye take an egges yolke harde roſted, and grinde it with a litle ſaffron, myrrhe and wyne, make a plaiſter, and apply it to the nauyl hote. Yf this ſuccede not, then it ſhalbe neceſſary for to make a pouder to geue him ī his meat with a litle ſuger and in a ſmal quantitye thus.
            Take the pouder of hartes horne brēt, the pouder of goates clawes, or of ſwines clawes brent, the pouder of ye ſede of roſe which remain in the bery when the roſe is fallen, of euery one a porcion, make them verye fyne, &amp; with good redde wyne or almon mylke, and wheat floure, make it as it w

            And here is to be noted, that a naturall fluxe is neuer to bee feared afore the ſeuenth daye, and except there iſſue bloude, it ought not to bee ſtopped afore the ſayde tyme.
            Pouder of the herbe called knotgraſſe or the iuce thereof in a poſſette dronkē, or a plaiſter of theſame herbe, and of burſa paſtoris, bolearmeny, and the iuyce of plantaine with a litle vyneger, and wheate floure is excedynge good for theſame cauſe.
            Alſo the rindle maw of a young ſuckynge kydde geuen to the chylde, the weight of .x. graines, with the yolke of an egge ſoft roſted, and let the pacient abſtayne from mylke by the ſpace of .ii houres before and after, in ſtede wherof ye maye geue a roſted quince or a warden with a litle ſuger and, ſinamome to eate.
            Item an other goodly receit for theſame entent.

            Many other thinges are written of authours in the ſayd diſeaſe, whiche I here leaue out for breuitie: &amp; alſo bycauſe the afore reherced medicines are ſufficiēt ynough in a caſe curable: yet wyl I not omytte a goodly practiſe in the ſayde cure. The peſyl of an hart or a ſtagge dryed in pouder and dronken, is of great &amp; wonderful effect in ſtoppyng a fluxe. Which thing alſo is approued in the lyuer of a beaſt called in Englyſſhe an otter. The ſtones of him dronken in pouder, a litle at ones thirtye daies togyther, hath healed men for euer of the ſallyng euyl.
            
               ¶Of ſtoppyng of the bellye. 
               
               EVen as a fluxe is daungerous, ſo is ſtoppynge &amp; hardeneſſe of the bellye greuous &amp; noyeſome to the chylde, and is often cauſe of the colycke and other diſeaſes.
            Wherfore in this caſe ye muſt alway put a litle hony into ye chyldes meate, and let the nource gyue hym honye to ſucke vpon her fynger, and if this wil not helpe, then the nexte is to myxe a lytle fyne and cleare turpentine, with honye, and ſo to reſolue it in a ſaucer, and let the chylde ſuppe of it a lytle. This medicine is deſcrybed of Paulus Agineta, and recited of dyuers other as a thyng very holſom and agreing to the nature of the child: for it doeth not only loſen ye bellye without grefe or daunger, but doeth alſo purge the lyuer and the longes, with ye ſplene and kidneies, generally comforting al the ſpirituall membres of the bodye.
            The gall of an oxe or a cowe layed

The ſignes dyffer according to ye wormes. For in the long &amp; roūd, the paciēt cōmonly hath a drye cough, paine in the belly about ye guttes, ſomtyme yeaxing &amp; trēbling in ye nighte, &amp; ſtarte ſodaynely, and fal aſlepe againe,

other whyles they gnaſſhe and grynd theyr teeth togither, the eies waxe holowe, with an eygre loke, &amp; haue great delyte in ſlombryng, and ſylence, very loth whē they are awaked. The pulſe is incertayne, and neuer at one ſtaye, ſomtyme a feuer with greate colde in ye ioyntes, which endureth thre or .iiii

The long and brode wormes are knowen by theſe ſygnes, that is to ſay, by yelowneſſe or whittiſhneſſe of ye eyes, intollerable hunger, greate gnawinge and grypyng in the belly, ſpecially afore meat, water commyng out at the mouth, or at ye foundament, continuall ytche and rubbing of the noſethrilles,

ſonken eies and a ſtynkyng breath, alſo when the perſon doth his eaſement, there appeareth in the donge lytle flat ſubſtaunces, moche lyke the ſeedes of cucumers or gourdes.
            The other leſſe ſorte are engendred in the great gutte, &amp; may wel be knowen by the excedyng ytche in the fundament within, &amp; are oftentimes ſene commyng out with the excrementes. They be called of phiſiciōs, aſcarydes.
            
               ¶Remedy for wormes, in chyldren. The herbe that is founde growyng vpon oiſters by the ſeas ſyde, is a ſynguler remedy to deſtroye wormes, and is called therfore of ye Grekes Scolytabotan
                  •
               , that is to ſay, the herbe that kylleth wormes: it muſte be made in pouder, and gyuen with ſweate milke to the chylde to drynke. The Phiſicions call the ſame herbe coralino.
            
               ¶A ſinguler receyte for to kyll wormes. Take the gall of a bull or oxe, newlye

kylled, and ſtampe in it an handful of good comyne, make a playſtre of it, and lay it ouer all the belly, remouing the ſame euery ſyxe houres.
            Item the gall of a bull with ſeedes of colocinthis, called colloquintida of the pothecaryes, and an handfull of baye beries wel made togither in a plaiſter, with a ſponful of ſtrong vinegre, is of greate effecte in the ſame caſe.
            Yf the childe be of age or ſtrong complexion, ye may make a fewe pilles of aloes, and the pouder of wormeſeed, then wynd them in a pece of a ſinging lofe, and annoynte them ouer wyth a lytle butter: and let thē be ſwalowed downe hole without chewyng.
            
               ¶Of ſwellyng of the nauill. IN a child lately borne, and tender, ſomtyme by cuttyng of the nauyll to nere, or at an inconueniente ſeaſon, ſometyme by ſwadlynge or byndynge amyſſe, or of moche cryinge, or coughynge, it happeneth otherwhyles, that the nauyll

aryſeth and ſwelleth with great paine and apoſtemacion, the remedy wherof is not muche differente from the cure of vlcers, ſauynge in thys that ye oughte to applye thynges of leſſe attraction, then in other kind of vlcers, as for an example, ye maye make an oyntmente vnder thys fourme. Take ſpike or lauender, halfe an ounce, make it in pouder, and wyth thre ounces of fyne and cleare turpentyne, tempre it in an oyntmente, addyng a portion of oyle of ſwete almons. But yf it come of cryinge, take a lytle beane floure, and the aſſhes of fyne lynnen cloutes brente, and tempre it with redde wine and honye, and laye it to the ſore.
            
               ¶A playſter for ſwellyng in the nauill. Take cowes donge, and drye it in poudre, barlye floure, and beane floure of eche a porcion, the iuyce of knotgraſſe a good quantitie, comine a litle, make a playſter of all and ſet it to the nauyl.
            
               
               ¶An other.
Take cowes donge and ſeeth it in the mylke of the ſame cowe, and lay it on the grefe. This is alſo marueylouſe effectuall to helpe a ſoodayne ache, or ſwelling in the legges.
            
               Of the ſtone in chyldren. THe tender age of children as I ſayd afore, is vexed and afflicted with manye greuous and peryllous diſeaſes, amōg whō there is fewe or none ſo violente or more to be feared in them, then that whiche is moſt feared in al kindes of ages, that is to ſay, the ſtone, an houge and a pityful diſeaſe, euer the more encreaſyng in dayes, ye more rebelling to the cure of Phyſycke, Therfore is it excedyng daungerouſe whan it falleth in children, for aſmoch as neither the bodyes of them may be wel purged of the matter antecedent, called humor peccans, nor yet cā abide any vyolent medecyne hauyng power

to breake it, by reaſon wherof the ſaid dyſeaſe acquyreth ſuche a ſtrengthe aboue nature, that in proceſſe of time it is vtterlye incurable.
            Yet in the begynning it is oftentimes healed thus.
            Fyrſte lette the nurſe be well dyeted, or the chyld, yf it be of age, abſtaining from al groſſe meates, and hard of digeſtion, as is beafe, bacon, ſalt meates and cheeſe, than make a pouder of the roote of peonye dryed, and myngle it with as muche hony as ſhal be ſufficient, or yf the child abhorre hony, make it vp with ſuger molten a lytle vpon the cooles, and gyue thereof vnto the chylde, more or leſſe, accordinge to the ſtrengthe, twyſe a daye, tylle ye ſe the vryne paſſe eaſelye, ye maye alſo giue it in a rere egge, for without dout it is a ſynguler remedye in chyldren.
            
               ¶An oyntment for the ſame. Oyle of ſcorpions, yf it may be gotten, is exceding good to annoint withal the membres, and the nether parte

of the bellye, ryghte agaynſt the bladder, ye may haue it at the pothecaries▪
            
            
               ¶A ſinguler bath for the ſame entent. Take mallowes, holyhocke, lyly rootes, lynſeed, and parietary of the wal, ſeeth them all in the broth of a ſhepes head, and therin vſe to bathe the chyld oftentymes, for it ſhal open the ſtraytnes of the condites, that the ſtone may iſſue, ſwage the payne, and brynge out the grauel with the vrine, but in more effect whan a playſter is made, as ſhal be ſayde herafter, and layed vpon the raynes, and the belly, immediatly after the bathyng.
            
               ¶A playſter for the ſtone. Take parietarie of the wal, one portion, and ſtampe it, doues donge an other porcion, and grynde it, than frye thē both in a panne, with a good quā
               titye of freſhe buttyre, and as hote, as may be ſuffered, lay it to the belly and the backe, and from .iiii. houres to .iiii let it be renewed.
            
               This is a ſouerayne medicine in all maner ages.
            Item an other pouder whiche is made thus.
            Take the kernels or ſtones that are found in the fruyte, called openers or meſpiles, or of ſome, medlars.
            Make them in fine pouder, whiche is wounderfull good for to breake the ſtone without daunger, both in yonge and olde.
            The cheſtwormes dryed and made in fyne pouder, taken with the brothe of a chycken, or a lytle ſuger, helpeth them, that can not make theyr vryne.
            
               ¶Of pyſſyng in the bedde. MAny times for debility of vertue retentiue of the reines or blader, as wel olde mē as children are oftentimes annoyed, whan their vrine iſſueth out either in theyr ſlepe or waking againſt theyr wylles, hauing no power to reteine it whan it cōmeth, therfore yf they wil be holpē, fyrſt they muſt auoid al fat meates, til

ye vertue retentiue be reſtored againe and to vſe this pouder in their meates and drynkes.
            Take the weſande of a cocke, and plucke it, thā brenne it in pouder, and vſe of it twiſe or thryes a daye. The ſtones of an hedgehogge poudred is of the ſame vertue.
            Item the clawes of a goate, made in pouder dronken, or eaten in pottage. If the pacient be of age, it is good to make fyne plates of leade, with holes in them, and lette them lye often to the naked backe.
            
               ¶Of bruſtynge. THe cauſes of it in a childe are many, for it may come of very lyghte occaſions, as of greate cryeng, &amp; ſtopping the breathe, byndyng to ſtrayghte, or by a fal, or of to greate rockyng, and ſuch lyke, may cauſe the filme that ſpreadeth ouer the bally, to breake or to ſlacke, and ſo the guttes fall downe, into the cod, which yf it be not vtterly vncurable, may be

healed after thys ſorte.
            Fyrſte laye the paciente ſo vpon his backe, that hys heade maye be lower than his heales, than take and reduce the bowels with youre hande, into the due place, afterwarde ye ſhall make a playſter to be layde vpon the coddes, and bounde with a lace round aboute the backe, after this fourme.
            Take roſin, frankynſence, maſtyke, comyne, lyneſeed, &amp; anyſe ſeed of euery one a lyke, pouder of oſmonde rootes, that is to ſaye of the brode ferne, ye .iiii. parte of al, make a plaiſter with ſufficient oyle olyue, and freſſhe ſwynes grece, and ſprede it on a lether, and let it cōtinue (except a great neceſſity) two or thre wekes, after that applye an other lyke, tyll ye ſee amendment. In thys caſe it is verye good to make a poudre of the heares of an hare, &amp; to temper it with ſugre or conſerua roſes and giue it to the child twies euery daye.
            If it be aboue the age of .vii. yere, ye

may make a ſinguler receyte in drinke to be taken euerye daye twyſe, thus.
            
               ¶A drynke for one that is broſten. Take matfelon, dayſies, comfery, and oſmundes, of euerye one a lyke, ſeet them in the water of a ſmythes forge to the third part, in a veſſel couered, o
                  •
                a ſofte fyer, than ſtrayne it and giue to drynke of it, a good draughte at ones mornyng and euenynge, addyng euermore in his meates and drinkes, the pouder of the heare of an hare, beynge dryed.
            
               ¶Of fallyng of the fundament. 
               MAny times it happeneth that the gut called of the latīes rectum inteſtinū, falleth out at the fūdament, &amp; can not be gotten in againe wythoute peyne and labour, whiche diſeaſe is a common thynge in children, comming oftentimes of a ſodayne cold or a long laxe, and maye well be cured by theſe ſubſcribed medicines.
            
               If the gutte hath ben longe out, and be ſo ſwollen that it cānot be repoſed, or by coldnes of the ayre be congeled, the beſt counſell is to let the child ſit on a hote bathe, made of the decoccion of mallowes, holihocke, lineſeed, and the rootes of lyllyes, wherin ye ſhall bathe the fundamente, wyth a ſofte cloute or a ſponge, and whan the place is ſuppled thruſte it in agayne, whiche done, than make a pouder thus.
            
               ¶A pouder for fallyng of the foundament. Take the poudre of an hartes horne brent, the cuppes of acornes dried, roſe leaues dryed, goates clawes brent, the rinde of a pomegranate, and of galles, of euerye one a portion. Make them in pouder, and ſtrowe it on the fundament. It ſhal be the better, yf ye put a lytle on the gutt, afore it be repoſed in ye place, &amp; after it be ſetled, to put more of it vpon the fūdament, than binde it in with hote lynnen clothes, and gyue the childe quynces, or a roſted warden

to eate with cinamome and ſuger.
            
               ¶An other good pouder for the ſame. Take galles, myrre, frankenſence, maſtike, and aloes, of euery one a litle make them in a pouder, and ſtrowe it on the place.
            A lytle tarre with goſegreſe is alſo very good in this caſe.
            
               ¶An other good remedye. Take the wolle from betwenethe legges, or of ye necke of a ſhepe, which is full of ſweate and fattie, than make a iuce of vnſette leekes, and dippe the wolle in it, and laye it to the place as whotte, as may be ſuffered, and whan it waxeth cold remoue it and apply an other hote, this is a very good remedy for fallynge of the fundament.
            If the chylde prouoke many tymes to ſeege, and can expell nothynge, that dyſeaſe is called of the Grekes teneſmos, for the whiche it ſhall be verye good to apply a playſter made of gardeine creſſis &amp; a comine in lyke quātitye,

frye them in butter, and laye it on the bellye as hote as he maye ſuffer. It is alſo commended, to fume the nether partes with turpentine and pitch, and to ſit longe vpon a bourd of ceder or iuniper, as maye be poſſible.
            
               ¶Chafyng of the ſkynne. IN the flankes, armeholes, &amp; vnder the eares, it chaunceth often times that the ſkynne fretteth, ether by the childes own vryne, or for the defaute of waſhyng, or els by wrappyng and kepyng to hote.
            Therefore in the begynnyng, ye ſhall annoint the places, with freſhe capons grece, then yf it wyll not heale, make an oyntment, and laye it on the place.
            
               ¶An oyntment for chafyng and gallyng. Take the roote of the floure deluyce dryed, of redde roſes dryed, galingale and maſtike, of eche a lyke quantytye, beate them into moſte ſubtyle pouder: than with oyle of roſes, or of lineſeede make a ſoft oyntment.
            
               Item the longes of a wether dryed, and made in very fyne pouder, healeth al chafynges of the ſkinne: and in lyke maner the fragmentes of ſhomakers lether, brent and caſt vpon the place, in as fine pouder as is poſſible, hath the ſame effecte, whiche thing is alſo good for the galling or chafing of the fete, of whatſoeuer cauſe it commeth.
            Item beane floure, barly floure, and the floure of fitches tempered with a lytle oyle of roſes, maketh a ſoueraine ointment for the ſame entent.
            If the chafinges be great, it is good to make a bath of holihocke, dyll, violets and lineſeede with a litle branne, than to waſhe theſame places oftentymes, and lay vpon the ſore, ſome of theſame thinges. The decoction of plantaine, burſa paſtoris, horſetaile and knot-graſſe, is exceadynge good to heale all chafynges of the ſkynne.

            They bee bothe of one nature, and procede of one cauſe, ſauinge that the meaſils are engendred of the inflāmacion of bloude, and the ſmall pockes of the inflammacion of bloude myngled with cholere.
            The ſygnes of them bothe are ſo manyfeſte to ſyghte, that they nede no farther declaracyon, for at the fyrſte ſome haue an ytche and a freting of the ſkynne as yf it hadde bene rubbed wyth nettles, payne in the heade and in the backe, the face redde in coloure and flecked, feare in the ſleepe, greate thyrſt, redneſſe of the eyes, beatynge in the temples, ſhotynge and pryckyng thorough all the bodye, then anone after, when they breake out, they bee ſene of dyuers faſhions and

fourmes, ſometimes as it were a drye ſcabbe or a lepry ſpredyng ouer all the members, other whiles ī puſhes, pimples, and wheles, rennyng with much corrupcion and matter, and with great peine of the face and throte, drines of the toungue, horcenes of voyce, and in ſome quiuerynge of the hearte with ſwownyng.
            The cauſes of theſe euil affeccions, are reherſed of authours, to be chiefly .iiii. Fyrſt of the ſuperfluities which might be corrupt in the womb of the mother, the chylde there beyng, and receiuinge theſame into the poores, the whiche at that tyme for debility of nature, could not be expelled, but ye chyld encreſyng afterward in ſtrength, bee dryuen out of the veines into the vpper ſkynne.
            Secondarilye it maye come of a corrupt generacion, that is to ſaye whan it was engendred in an euyll ſeaſon, ye mother being ſycke of her naturall infyrmitye, for ſuch as are begotten that tyme verye ſeldome eſcape the diſeaſe

of leprye.
            The thyrde cauſe maye bee an euyll dyete of the nourſe, or of the chylde it ſelf, whan they fede vpon meates that encreaſe rotten humours, as mylke and fyſhe both at one meale, lykewyſe exceſſe of eating and drinking, and ſurfitte.
            Fourthly this diſeaſe commeth by the waye of contagion, whan a ſycke perſon infecteth an other, and in that caſe it hath great affinitie with the peſtilence.
            
               ¶Remedy. The beſte and moſt ſure help in this caſe, is not to meddle with anye kynde of medicines, but to let nature worke her operacion, notwythſtandynge yf they be to ſlowe in commyng oute, it ſhal be good for you to geue the childe to drinke, ſodden mylke and ſaffron, &amp; ſo kepe hym cloſe, and warme, wherby they may the ſoner iſſue foorth, but in no caſe to adminiſter any thynge that myght eyther repreſſe the ſwelling of

the ſkinne, or to coole the heate that is within the members. For yf this dyſeaſe which ſhould be expelled by a natural accion of ye body to ye long health afterward of the pacient, wer by force of medicine cowched in againe, it wer euē inough to deſtroy the child Therfore abide ye ful breaking out of ye ſaid wheales, and then (if they be not ripe) eaſe the childes peyne by makynge a bath of holihock, dyl, camomil &amp; fenel: if thei be ripe &amp; matter, thē take fenel, wormewood and ſage, and ſeeth them in water, to the thirde part, wherin ye maye bathe him with a fine cloth or a ſponge. Alwaies prouided yt he take no cold duryng the time of his ſickeneſſe. The wyne wherein fygges haue bene ſod, is ſinguler good in theſame caſe, &amp; may be wel vſed in all times &amp; cauſes.
            Yf the wheales bee outragious and great, with much corroſiō and venime, ſome make a decoction of roſes &amp; plā
               taine, in the water of oke, and diſſolue in it a litle engliſhe hony &amp; camphore.
            
               The decoction of water betonye, is approued good in the ſayed diſeaſes. Likewiſe ye ointment of herbes, wherof I made menciō ī ye cure of ſcabbes, is exceding holſome after the ſores are rype.
            Moreouer it is good to droppe in the pacientes eyes .v. or vi. tymes a daye, a litle roſe or fenell water, to coumforte the ſyght, leſte it be hurte by continual rennīg of matter. This water muſt be miniſtred in the ſommer colde, &amp; in the wīter ye ought to apply it luke warm.
            Theſame roſe water is alſo good to gargle in his mouth, yf the chylde bee then payned in the throte.
            And leſt the condites of ye noſe ſhould be ſtopped, it ſhalbe very expedient to let him ſmel often to a ſponge wete in the iuce of ſauerye, ſtrong vineger, and a litle roſe water.
            To take away the ſpottes &amp; ſcarres of the ſmal pockes and meaſels.
            The bloude of a bull or of an hare is much commēded of authours to be annointed

hote vpon the ſcarres, &amp; alſo ye licour ye iſſueth out of ſhepes clawes or goates clawes het in the fier. Item the dripping of a cignet or ſwanne laid vpon the places oftentimes hote,
            
               Feuers. YF the feuer vſe to take the chylde with a great ſhakyng, and afterwarde hote, whether it be cotidian or tercian, it ſhall be ſinguler good to geue it in drinke, the blacke ſeedes of Peony made in fine pouder, ſearced and mingled with a litle ſuger.
            Alſo take plantain, fetherfew and verneine, and bath the chyld in it once or twyſe a daye, binding to the pulces of the handes and fete a plaiſter of ye ſame herbes ſtamped, and prouoke the child to ſweate afore the fitte commeth.
            Some geue counſell in a hote feuer, to applye a colde plaiſter to the breaſt, made in this wyſe. Take the iuyce of wormewood, plantain, mallowes and houſleke, and temper in them aſmuche barly floure as ſhal bee ſufficiente, and

vſe it. Or thus, and more better in a weake paciente.
            Take drye roſes and pouder them, then temper the pouder with the iuice of endiue or purcelane, roſe water, and barly floure, and make a plaiſter to the ſtomake.
            Item an ointmente for hys temples armes and legges, made of oyle of roſes, and populeon, of eche like muche.
            
               A good medicine for the ague in children. Take plantaine with the roote, and waſh it, then ſeeth it in fayre runnyng water to the thirde parte: whereof ye ſhal geue it a draught (yf it bee of age to drinke) with ſufficiente ſuger, &amp; laye the ſodden herbes as hote as maye be ſuffred, to the pulſes of the handes and fete. Thys muſt be done a litle afore ye fit, &amp; afterward couer it with clothes.
            The oyle of nettles wherof I ſpake in the title of ſtifnes of limmes, is exceding good to annointe the members in a colde ſhaking ague.
            
               
               of the griefe.
Yf there be muche inflāmacion or heate in the coddes, ye may make an oyntment of plantaine, the whyte and yolke of an egge, and a porcion of oyle of roſes, ſtyrre them wel aboute, &amp; applye it to ye grefe twiſe or thriſe a day.
            When the paine is intollerable, and the child of age, or of ſtrong complexion, yf the premiſſes wil not helpe, ye ſhal make a plaiſter after this ſorte. Take henbane leaues, an handful and an halfe, mallowe leaues, an handfull, ſeeth them well in cleare water, then ſtampe them and ſtyrre them, and with a litle of the brothe, beane floure, barly floure, oyle of roſes and camomyl ſufficient, make it vp and ſet on the ſwelling luke warme. Henbane as Auicēne ſayth, is excedynge good to reſolue the hardnes of the ſtones by a ſecret qualitye. Notwithſtandyng, yf it come of winde, it ſhalbe better to vſe the ſayde plaiſters yt are made with comine, for that is of a ſinguler operaciō in diſſoluyng

winde, as affirmeth Dioſcorides writyng of the qualities of cumine.
            
               Of ſacer ignis or chingles IN Greke heriſipelas, and of the Latines Sacer ignis, oure Engliſhe women call it the fyre of Saynt Anthony, or chingles, it is an inflammacion of members wyth exceding burnynge and redneſſe, harde in the feelyng, and for the moſte parte crepeth aboue the ſkynne or but a lytle depe within the fleſhe.
            It is a grieuous paine, &amp; may be likened to the fyre in conſuming. Wherefore the remedies yt are good for burning are alſo very holeſome here ī this caſe. And fyrſte the grene ointment of herbes deſcribed in ye chapter of itche, is of good effect alſo in this cure: more ouer ye medicines yt are here deſcribed. Take at the pothecaries of vnguentū Galeni an ounce and an halfe, oyle of roſes two ounces, vnguenti populeon one ounce, ye iuce of plantain, &amp; nightſhade one ounce or more, the whites of

iii. egges, heat thē altogether, &amp; ye ſhal haue a good ointmēt for the ſame purpoſe.
            
               An other. Take earthwormes and ſtampe them in vineger, then annoint the grefe euery two houres.
            Item ye donge of a ſwan, or in lacke of it the donge of a goſe ſtamped with the whyte and yolke of an egge, is good.
            Item doues donge ſtamped in ſalet oyle or other, is a ſinguler remedy for the ſame purpoſe.
            
               Of burnyng and ſcalding. FOr burning and ſcalding whether it be with fier, water, oile, leade, pytch, lime, or any ſuche infortune: Ye muſt beware ye ſet no repercuſſiue at ye fyrſt, that is to ſaye no medicine of extreme colde, for that might chaunce to driue the feruēt heat into the ſinowes and ſo ſtoppethe poores, that it could not iſſue, whereof ſhould happen much inconuenience in a great burnyng (but in ſmal it coulde not be ſo daungerous:) wherfore ye beſt

is when ye ſee a member eyther brent or ſcalded, as is ſayde afore.
            Take a good quantitie of brine, which is made of water and ſalt, not to excedyng eyger or ſtronge, but of a meane ſharpnes, and with a clout or a ſponge bathe the member in it colde, or at the leaſt bloud warm, thre or foure houres together, the longer the better: For it ſhall aſſwage muche of the peine, open the pores, cauſe alſo the fyer to vapour and geue a great comfort to the weake member. Thē annoint the place with one of theſe medicines.
            Take oyle of roſes one parte, ſwete creme two partes, hony halfe a parte, make an oyntment and vſe it.
            Item all the medicines deſcribed in the laſt chapter, are of greate effecte in this caſe, likewyſe the grene ointment made of water betonye.
            Item a ſoueraine medicine for burnynge and ſcaldynge, and all vnkynde heates is thus made. Take a doſen or more of hard roſted egges, and put the

yolkes in a pot on the fyer by thē ſelf, without licour, ſtyrre them and braye them with a ſtrong hand, tyll there aryſe as it wer a froth or ſpume of oyle to the mouth of the veſſell, then preſſe the yolkes and reſerue the licour, this is called oile of egges: a very precious thyng in the foreſayde cure.
            Moreouer ther is an oyntment made of ſheepes dounge fryed in oyle or in ſwines grece, than putte to it a litle waxe, and vſe it.
            Alſo take quicke lime and waſhe it in veriuce .ix. or .x. tymes, than mingle it with oile, &amp; kepe it for theſame entent. Item the iuyce of the leaues of lylyes v. partes, and vineger one parte, hony a lytle, maketh an excellent medicine, not onely for this entent, but for al other kynd of h

               ¶Of gogle eyes. THis impedimēt is neuer healed but in a very yong child, euen at the beginning,

whervnto there is appointed no manner kind of medicine, but only an order of kepyng, that is to ſaye, to laye the chylde ſo in his cradelle, that he maye beholde directe agaynſte the light, &amp; not to turne his eies on either of bothe ſydes.

            Item an herbe at the pothecaries called ſtauiſacre, brimſtone, and vinegre, is excedyng good.
            It is good to giue the pacient often in his drincke, pouder of an hartes horne brente.
            Stauiſacre with oile is a marueilouſe holſome thyng in thys caſe.
