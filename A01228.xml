            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            NOw that solempne feast of murdred Amyntas aproached:
            And by the late edict by Pembrokiana pronounced,
            Yuychurches nymphs and pastors duely prepared
            With fatall Garlands of newfound flowre Amaranthus,
            
            Downe in Amyntas dale, on Amyntas day be asembled.
            Pastymes ouerpast, and death's celebration ended,
            Matchles Lady regent, for a further grace to Amyntas
            
            Late transformd to a flowre; wills euery man to remember
            Some one God transformd, or that transformed an other:
            And enioynes each nymph to recount some tale of a Goddesse
            That was changd herself, or wrought some change in an other:
            And that as euery tale and history drew to an ending,
            Soe sage Elpinus with due attention harckning,
            Shuld his mynd disclose, and learned opinion vtter.
            
               Thirsis turne was first: whoe after his humble obeissance
            Made to the Lady regent, thus fram'de himself to be singing.
            
               When noe fyre, noe ayre, noe earth, noe water apeared,
               Confusd fyre, rude ayre, vast earth, dull water abyded.
               Water, th'earth and ayre and fyre extreamely defaced,
               And fyre, th'earth and ayre and water fowly deformed.
               For where water or earth, where ayre or fyre was abyding,
               Fyre, ayre, earth, water were also ioyntly remaynyng.
               Fyre and ayre and earth with a shapeles water abounded,
               And earth ayre and fyre, that shapeles water aforded,
               Eueryone was in all, and all was in euery one thing,
               
                  Soe each one made all, made this rude All, to be nothing,
               Nothing els but a heape, but a masse, but a lump, but a cluster;
               Cluster, lump, masse, heape, where seedes of things disagreeing
               Fyre, ayre, earth, water lay all confusd in a corner.
               Hoate things fled fro the colde, dry could not abide to be moystned,
               Hard contemned soft, and light fro the heauy retyred.
               Noe peace, noe concord, noe good conformable order,
               Nought but warrs and iarrs, all strife, and all on an vproare.
               Noe aire transparent, noe Sunne was cause of a daylight,
               Noe nights-light Phoebe was a chearfull guide to the darcknes;
               Earth was not yet firme, fire could not yeeld any sparkles,
               Water would not flow: til sou'raigne God Demogorgon
               
               Ends these broyles, brings peace, setts euery thing in an order.
               Heau'n fro the earth he dyuides, and earth fro the water he parteth,
               And pure Christall skye from grosse thick ayre he remoueth.
               These things thus distinct, in seu'rall places he setleth,
               Light fyre mounteth aloft, and lyfts it-self to the heauen,
               Ayre next in lightnes, next him was placed in highnes,
               Grosse earth drew downeward, and stayd herselfe by the centre,
               Water cleaues to the earth, and there as a border abydeth.
               Fyre, ayre, earth, water were euery howre in an vproare,
               Whilst they lay on a heape, and all dwelt ioyntly togeather;
               Fyre, ayre, earth, water were brought to a peacable order,
               When they lodged apart, each one in seueral harbor.
               Thus by a disioyning, Elements were mightily ioyned,
               And by disunyting vnyted fyrmely for euer.
               Each part thus placed, round earth was cast in a compas
               Lyke to a globe or a ball, that noe syde might be vnequall.
               Then were swelling Seas powrd foorth in places apoynted
               Here and there by the earth; whose braunches duly dyuyded
               Kyngdomes from kyngdomes: then first came springs fro the mountayns,
               Pooles were pitcht in moores, and lakes lay downe by the valleys,
               Ryuers flowd by the fyelds with a thowsand slippery wyndings,
               Some suckt vp by the earth, some ran to the sea with a restles
               race, his shoare for a banck with billowes mightyly beating.
               Then fyelds stretcht themselues, then meddowes gan to be flowring,
               Greene leaues cou'red trees, and trees gaue shade to the forrests,
               Mountayns mounted aloft, and dales drew speedyly downewarde.
               Ouer sea and earth, the relenting ayre he reposed,
               And there foggs and mystes and clustred clowds he apoynted.
               Thence come thunder-clapps, thence lightnings, there be the blustring
               Wyndes, whose roaring blasts would teare this world in a thousand
               
                  Peeces, might they rage at randon: but the prefixed
               Coastes are known, for these fowre brawling brethren apoynted.
               
                  Eurus flew to the East, where Memnons mother ariseth,
               Sweete Zephyrus to the Weast, where Sunnes reuolution endeth,
               Cold Boreas to the North, whence frosts are dayly proceeding,
               Moyst Auster to the South, where showres are euer abounding.
               Next to the ayre, bright sky, as a royall throane he reposed,
               And eache parte thereof with starrelight all to beesprinckled.
               Thus was an ougly Chaos transformd at last to a braue worlde,
               Soe braue, that t'was a world soe woorthy a world to be seeing.
               Euery quarter of it with such lyue things was adorned,
               As were conuenyent and seemely for euery quarter.
               Gods dwelt in bright skyes, and Christall-mantled Olympus,
               
               Fowles did fly by the ayre, and Fishes swam by the waters,
               Mylde beastes fed by the fyelds, and wylde beasts rangde by the Forrests.
               But man was wanting, who might be the absolut owner,
               And haue perfect rule and iurisdiction ouer
               Mylde beasts and wylde beasts, and Foules and slippery fishes.
               At length Man was made of mould by the crafty Prometheus,
               
               Crafty Prometheus, whoe by degrees contriued a picture,
               And gaue life to the same with fyre that he stole fro the heauens.
               And, where other beasts lay poaring downe to the grownd-wards,
               Man with a greater state had a looke lyft vp to Olympus,
               
               Whence his better part was then but lately deryued.
               Thiswas an age of gold, then was Saturnus an Emprour,
               Sythe-bearing Saturne rul'de iustly without any iudges,
               Noe lawes, noe lawyers were then, yet noebody lawlesse,
               Noe theeues and robbers were hangd, yet noebody robbed,
               Noe bloody manqueller was kyld, yet noebody murdred.
               Vndissembled loue and playne symplycyty ruled,
               Vncorrupted fayth and pure synceryty raigned.
               Hart conceaud noe harme; tong, harts interpreter only,
               Playnly without any glose or dissimulation op'ned
               Harts harmeles conceipts: hands, true and trusty to practyse,
               Did, what his hart contryu'd, or tong had truly delyu'red.
               Pinetrees pitcht vpon hills, gaue wonted grace to the hill-topp,
               Not with gaping gulfs of Auernus dayly bedashed,
               But with trickling showres of Olympus sweetly bedeawed.
               Euery man kept home, and where he receau'd a beginning,
               There did he make his graue, and drew his dayes to an ending.
               Noebodie was soe mad by the ragged rocks to be ranging,
               And with clowds, windes, seaes, nay heau'n and hell to be stryuyng,
               
                  Only to spy and ly, and feede fooles eares with a wonder,
               How fro Geneua to Gaunt, from Gaunt he repair'd to Vienna,
               
               How fro the Turk to the Pope, fro the Pope to the Souldan of Aegipt,
               
               And at last came back fro the newfound world as an old foole,
               With fowre Dutch-french woords, with a strange-cutt beard, or a Cassock.
               Noe townes were walled, noe walls were loftyly towred,
               Noe towres were planted with diu'ls inuention ord'nance.
               Euery bush was a bowre, and euery rustical harbor
               Was sort sufficient, where noe force was to be feared.
               Deaths-forerunner Drum did sownd no dreadful Alarum;
               Noe man-murdring man with a teare-flesh pyke, or a pollax,
               Or blood-sucking sweard was known by the name of a Sowldyer.
               Peace made euery man secure, securyty careles,
               Carelesnes causd myrth, myrth neuer dreeds any danger.
               Fruytefull ground vntorne, vntutcht, was free fro the plough snare,
               And self-sufficient, of her owne selfe yeelded aboundance.
               Noe new-found dishes were sought, noe costly deuises
               Farr-fetcht and deare bought: men simple lyued a simple
               Lyfe, vsd symple foode, sloe, nutt, plum, strawbery, apple,
               Ackorne falln fro the oake, and blackbery pluckt fro the bramble.
               Tygers were then tame, sharpe-tusked boare was obeissant,
               Stoordy Lyons lowted, noe woolf was knowne to be mankinde,
               Beares did bow at a beck, no serpent breathd any poyson.
               Spring was still-springing, whole yeare was wholly a spring-tyme,
               Eue-shyning sunne with clowds was neuer eclipsed,
               Euer-flowring flowrs with frosts were neuer anoyed.
               Lyfe-breathing Zephyrus with sweete blast charyly fostred
               Euery fruite, which th'earth of her owne free bounty aforded.
               Yea good-natur'd ground at last gaue plentiful haruest,
               Neuer sowd, still mowd▪ not tyld, yet syld with aboundance.
               Then floods flowde with mylke, each wel-spring then was a wyne-spring,
               Euery greene-hewde tree bare sweete and sugered honny.

                  THirsis hauing made an end of this tale to the content of the hearers generally; Elpinus began thus to worke vpon it. Poets and Painters (men say) may well goe together, sith pen and pencill be both alike free, and doo equally challeng the selfe same prerogatiue. Cicero reporteth, that Fabius a famous Romaine, thought it an especiall commendation, to be surnamed Pictor. And, Antiquissimum è doctis fuit poetarum genus, saith the same Cicero. When I talke of Painters, I meane not the ridiculous fraternitie of silly Wall-washers: neither doe I euer once thinke of our loftie rimers, when I make mention of Poets. Yet a wall may bee colored by an elegant Painter, but the conceite and elegancie is more then the colour: and poets (seeking as well to please, as to profit) haue well made choyce of verse, yet the making of a verse is no part of Poetrie: otherwise, the sweete and inimitable poeme of Heliodorus, should be no Poeme, and euery vnreasonable rimer should weare a Lawrell garland. Both poetry, a speaking picture, and paynting, a dumbe poetry, were like in this, that the one and the other did vnder an amyable figure and delightsome veyle, as it were, couer the most sacred mysteries of auncient philosophie. Nay, Pythagoras himselfe by his symbolicall kinde of teaching, as also Plato by his conceited parables and allegoricall discourses in his bookes called, Phoedrus, Timoeus, and Symposium, may make any man beleeue, that as the learned Indians, Aethiopians, and Aegyptians kept their doctrine religiously secret for feare of prophanation, so the Grecians by their example, haue wrapped vp in tales, such sweete inuentions, as of the learned vnfolder may well be deemed vonderfull though to a vulgar conceit, they seeme but friuolus imaginations. Yea that song of the most wise Salomon, called for the excellencie thereof the song of songs, is altogether mysticall and allegoricall, least any man thinke my speech but a tale, in attributing so much to poeticall tales: which, mee thinkes, may well bee compared to sweete grapes couered with leaues and brāches, or to the old Sileni, which being but ridiculous in shew, did yet inwardly conteine the sacred image of some God. He that cannot conceaue any sufficient cause which might induce antiquitie to deale thus warilie in matters of

such importance, let him knowe, that rerum 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , the picturing, fashioning figuring, or, as it were, personall representing of things in verse after this manner, is most effectuall and auayleable, to moue mens mindes, to stirre vp delight, to confirme memorie, and to allure and entice our cogitations by such familiar and sensible discourses, to matters of more diuine and higher contemplation. Poeticall songs are Galeries set forth with varietie of pictures, to hold euery mans eyes, Gardens stored with flowers of sundry sauours, to delite euery mans sence, orchyards furnished with all kindes of fruite, to please euery mans mouth. He that is but of a meane conceit, hath a pleasant and plausible narration, concerning the famous exploites of renowmed Heroes, set forth in most sweete and delightsome verse, to feede his rurall humor. They, whose capacitie is such, as that they can reach somewhat further then the external discourse and history, shall finde a morall sence included therein, extolling vertue, condemning vice, euery way profitable for the institution of a practicall and common wealth man. The rest, that are better borne and of a more noble spirit, shall meete with hidden mysteries of naturall, astrologicall, or diuine and metaphysicall philosophie, to entertaine their heauenly speculation. That this is true, let vs make triall, and first in Saturnus and Chaos, offered vnto vs by Thirsis: whereof, before we speake, it shall not be amisse to note this generally, for the better conceauing of ensuing particularities. Iupiter, Iuno, Neptune, Ceres, with the rest, are therfore called Gods and goddesses, for that in the superior and fierie region of the ayre noted by Iupiter, in the inferior, represented by Iuno, in the bowells of the earth, figured by Ceres, in the deapth of the Seaes, shadowed by Neptune, and so in others, there is, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , a certaine celestiall and diuine power, so called by Hippocrates, and by the ancient Poets more particularly expressed by the sundry titles of seuerall Deities proportionable thereunto. And, if the copulation or coniunction of these deified elements obserue the natural order of generation, it is called of the Poets a mariage of such a god and goddesse: if it swarue and degenerate from the wonted course of nature, they tearme it adulterie and libidinous loue, &amp; the parties, louers, not man and wife, as in the former kinde of copulation: so that, no mā hath cause to think it a ridiculous repugnancy &amp; impossibilitie, whē as Poets in their songs make mention of the loue, mariage, procreation, affinity, ofspring, pedegrees, and discents of their superior &amp; inferior gods.
               Now for the transformation of Thirsis his Chaos, true it is, that Ouid much after this manner discourseth of the creation of the world, of the reducing of the confused Chaos into distinct formes, of Prometheus his framing of man of the very earth it selfe: which things, no doubt, as also the distinction of times into foure seuerall ages, of gold, siluer, brasse, and yron, were taken, (although in part mistaken) out of the sacred monuments of Moyses.

Chaos as yet had not ended her chile-bearing labor &amp; trauaile, but was troubled with heauie burdens, fainty sweats, languishing groanes, &amp; fierie tormēting agonies; so that Demogorgon could not for pitie withdraw his helping hand, till by his assistance, she had brought forth Pan, with his three fatall sicters, and also Erebus, Aether, and Dies. Pan found such fauour, that Demogorgon committed vnto him the whole charge of his familie, commaunding his three sisters continually to waite and attend vpon him, as his handmaydes: And thus was Chaos at last deliuered, and eas
                     •
                  d of her childe-birth. By Demogorgon, or peraduenture, Demiurgon, is here vnderstood that one &amp; only creator of al, to whom Aeternitie is inseparably conioyned, sith himselfe is, was, and will be eternall and euerlasting. Chaos, in his eternall societie obteineth the third place, because she is that common, confused, and vndistinct matter, which the ancient Philosophers made Coeternall with the Creator: calling the one, the Father, the other the mother of al things formed; yet so, as they alwaies esteemed Demogorgon the chiefe and efficient, &amp; Chaos only the subsequent and secondary cause in this procreation. The reason why they ioyned Chaos with the Creator as a companion from all eternitie, was this: they thought it proceeded from him by a certaine eternall generation: so proceeding, as eternall, because alwaies proceeding; yet so eternall, as proceeding, because not of her selfe proceeding▪ but from the procreator. And as they made Chaos proc

                  erwards framed all things of this vnformed Chaos, not eternally, but in time. The tumult and vprore styrd vp in the bowels of Chaos is her naturall inclination and desire of bringing forth things variable and disagreeing. The hand of Demogorgon, which opened her bely, is that celestiall power, reducing the vniuersall and confused possibilities of Chaos, to distinct formes and actuall particularities, and giueth vs also to vnderstand, that this first production of things, was not vsuall and accustomed (as naturall generation is, which afterwards succeeded this supernaturall creation) but strang and wonderful, &amp; did therefore require the vse of Demogorgons hand, that is, the most mighty and effectuall instrument of all others. Strife came first forth: for from prima materia that

                  irst and generall matter of all that was made, the diuision and distinction of things, which before were confused and vndistinct, proceeded: &amp; this diuision is called strife; sith it conuerseth among foure striuing &amp; contrary elemēts, the one alwaies maligning &amp; repugning the other. His face was ougly &amp; deformed: for discord and diuision causeth defect,

want, &amp; imperfection, as vnion &amp; concord, are the authors of blessednes, beauty, and perfection. Strife striuing to get vp to heauen, was thrown down to the earth for in the celestiall bodies there is noe discord, noe repugnancy, and therfore consequently, noe destruction or mortalyty, effects thereof: but only in these earthly and inferior matters, contynually subiect to infynite decayes and dissolutions, caused by oppositions and contrarieties. The burdens, sweatings, groanings, and agonies of Chaos, are the euer-strugling and contending natures of the fowre elements, heauy earth, moyst water, breathing ayre, and consumyng fyre: for pacification whereof,

Scaliger lyketh not this cōceipt, sith they spare indeed rather the otherwise, one of thē only cutting of lyfe, whereas the other two maynteyn and preserue it. Varro thought they were in Latine called Parcae à pariendo of bringing foorth, whereupon their particular names were framed accordingly, of the tymes of byrth, the one being of the auncient Romayns called Nona, the other Decima, of the nynth and tenth moneth, in the which vsually by course of nature the childe is borne: yet, because whosoeuer is borne, is borne to dye, the third was named Morta of the Latyne Mors, which signifyeth Death, represented by the third fatall Lady.

They are here sayd to be borne of Chaos, sith in that first distinction and separation of things out of that confused heape and Masse, euery particular matter had his peculier desteny allotted vnto it: others would haue them to be borne of Erebus (the most hidden and remote part of the earth) and of Darcknes: that, by the obscurity of the father and mother, wee may imagine how difficult, nay how impossible a thing it is, to search out the hidden causes of Desteny.

               The sixt childe that Chaos brought foorth to Demogorgon, was named Erebus, a certaine naturall power incident to euery inferiour thing, and, as it were, cleauing and adhaerent thereunto: and this, in the terrestriall

globe, is the very matter it selfe, wherof things are made, the only cause of generation, corruption &amp; all other alterations in these inferior bodies: but in Man, the

                  , or little world, it signifieth that naturall appetite, and continuall desire, which man hath to obteyne new matters; whereupon the Poets haue also fayned, that this Erebus had many children, as Labour, Enuy, Feare, Deceipt, Fraud, Obstinacy, Pouerty, Mysery, Famyne, Lamentation, Sicknes, Death, and such like, whose mother they made Darknes, or Night, who bare to Erebus her husband this loathsome broode, according to those verses of Claudian in his first inuectiue against Rufinus.

               The two last children of Demogorgon, were Aether and Dies, the superirior region of the ayre, and the brightnes of the day: who, of brother and sister, became man and wife, and begat Caelius or Caelus, the heauen: which name was first attributed to Vranius, Father of Saturnus, king of Creete. This Vranius, for his excellency, was deemed rather caelestiall, (as his name importeth) then any earthly creature: representing that aethereall purity by his diuine wisedome, and the caelestiall light and brightnes, by his vertuous conuersation: this is the historicall sence: now for the Allegoricall conceipt, it is most manifest: for Caelus, the heauen, including and concluding euery thing, is therefore called the sonne of Aether and Dies, for that his nature is aethereall by reason of his most subtile and spirit all perspicuity; and also bright and lightsome by the plentifull and abundant light of those so many radiant starres wherewith it is sweetly garnished. And as Vranius himself for his vertue was called Caelus, heauen, soe Vesta his wife, because she was a fruitefull and happy mother, was called Terra, the Earth. Of these two, Saturnus was born, wholy addicted to husbandry and tilling of the earth, and of nature slowe and heauy, like the earth. Allegorically thus; Saturnus is Sonne to Caelus, because he is the first Planete, and nearest to the highest heauen. He is also sonne to the earth, as in most of his naturall proprieties resembling the earth. First his color is pale and leaden, like the earth: Secondly, as the earth of all other Elements

is most grosse and beauy, soe Saturne among other Planets is most slowe in finishing his reuolution, as requiring full thirty yeares for the accomplishing of the same; whereas Iupiter endeth his in twelue yeares, Mars in two, Sol, Venus, and Mercury in one, and Luna, the Moone, in one moneth only. Thirdly Saturne by his influence worketh such a constitution and temperature in mens bodies, as is altogeather agreeable with the qualities of the earth, to wette, cold and dry, making them in whom he is predominant, sad, melancholicall, graue, heauy, pale, giuen to husbandry, building, and such like exercises. Whereupon he is figured as an olde man, sad, euil-fauoured, musing, badly cloathed, with a sithe in his hand, a fit instrument for his earthly practise. He afordeth a reaching wit, profound cogitations, perfect knowledge, sage and graue aduice, constancy of minde and perseuerance: by reason that the earthly nature of his mother is qualified and tempered with that of his caelestiall Father. Lastly, as of his Father he causeth perfection and excellency of minde, so by his mother he is the author of deformity and destruction of the body,
               His wife was called Ops, his owne sister, borne of the same Father and Mother. Allegorically, Opis signifieth help or assistance, noting the ayde and furtherance of the earth herself towards the tilling of fyldes, building of howses, and founding of Cities. Soe is she worthily both sister to Saturne, as borne of Caelus, whose influence is the best mainteyner both of husbandry and earthly habitations: and also wife to Saturne, for that as he is the agent, soe herself is the patient in husbandry and fortification. Saturne bereft his father Caelus of those instruments which are fit for generation: Cronos, that is, Saturne, is time, time is the measurer of the worlds motion; therfore, as one world, soe one time, one Saturne; and Caelus can get no more like him, sith all is now spen

                   and consumed vpon him. Saturne fearing the prediction of Oracles, that his owne sonne should expell him out of his kingdome, consulting with his brother Titan, resolued to deuoure all the sonnes, that his wife Opis should beare vnto him; and for that intent commaunded her to shew him euery childe immediatly af
                     •
                  er the birth thereof. She first brought foorth Iupiter and Iuno: Iuno being a girle, and therefore not to be deuoured, was presented to her Father: but Iupiter was preserued from his rage and fury by the noyse of Cymballs &amp; Taburs, which soe possessed Saturne his eares, that he heard not the yong infant Iupiter, cry. Saturne angrily and earnestly demaunding where he was, his wife gaue him a Stone wrapped in a cloth, insteede of the boy, which stone for haste and rage, he swallowed, and afterwards vomited it vp againe, euen as he did all such of his other sonnes, whom he had deuoured. The like policy she vsed in preseruing of Neptune, making his father beleeue, that it was noe childe, but a yong colte, whereof she was then deliuered, which Saturne thinking to be true, glutted the colt accordingly, Next to these were Pluto and his sister Glauca borne: but Glauca being only shewed to Saturne, Pluto escaped aliue: all the rest of his sonnes he first deuoured, and presently vomyted, as before is mencioned

Allegorically, Titan the Sunne, and Saturne. Tyme, conspire together and resolue, that all things in tyme borne, shall also dye in time. For, as the deuouring continuance of outwearing time consumeth all things, so the life-giuing influence of the quickning sonne, is the chiefe cause of procreation: whereupon it is vsually said that Sol &amp; homo generant hominem, The sunne and man beget man. His daughters he deuoured not: for, time consumeth indiuidua, this thing, and that thing, but not the roote and ground of things, figured by the femall sex. Iuno the ayre, with Iupiter the fire, and Neptune and Pluto the water and earth, are not deuoured: for, the foure elements continue still: but the rest are still subiect to continuall corruption: corruption I meane in part, which is alwais a generation, of some other particularitie, not a totall or generall destruction: which is the cause, that time cannot digest and vtterly consume, but is enforced to vomite and restore euen those very bodies which hee first deuoured, according to that ould ground which giueth vs to learne, that, as nothing can be made of nothing▪ so nothing can be made to be nothing,
Gigni è nihilo nihil, in nihilum nil posse reuerti.

                  , for that be sucked Goates milke, the reason is this, a Goate is euer climing and getting vpward, as Iupiter is, noting the fierie and highest part of the ayre. This ethereall and superior part of the ayre, was thought of the Pythagoreans (by reason of the wonderfull celeritie and quick dispatch of his motion and reuolution) to cause a most sweete and melodious harmonie: whereupon Iupiter was reported to be preserued by the tinkeling of Cymballs and sounding of taburs.
               
                  Iupiter is placed immediatly after Saturne in heauen, as Iupiter King of Creete, succeeded his father Saturne in his kingdome. This Cr

                  etish King Iupiter for his bountifull and liberall nature was called by the name of that most good and beneficiall planet Iupiter; euen as his father, for the causes rehearsed, was named Saturnus. Hee that hath in his natiuitie Saturne predominant ouer Iupiter, is like to bee endued with no excellent qualities, especially those that vsually proceede from Iupiters influence, as Iustice, liberalitie magnificence, pietie, fauour, beauty, riches, promotion▪ loue, and such like: all which by the maligning nature of this damnifying planet Saturne are altogether corrupted and depraued, as the Creetish Iupiter when he was but a tender i

Saturne being imprisoned and chayned by the Titanes, was released by his dutifull and mercifull sonne Iupiter, who came with a mightie army to the succor of his father. Allegorically when the good and beneficiall Iupiter in any mans natiuitie ouer-ruleth preiudiciall Saturne, beholding the other planets with an amyable and fortunat aspect, which confoundeth the dead lookes and frowning face of Saturne, then is that man freed from th

                     aturnian chaynes of calamitie and miserie, which otherwise he were

subiect vnto. These Titanes were the sonnes of heauen and earth, signifying the foure elements, which include in themselues a certaine terrene and earthly nature, and are therefore continually depressed and beaten downe by the power of the superior bodies: for, vapors by the heate of the sunne (the sunne is called Titan) are drawne vp, which when they approach neere the celestiall region, are repelled and driuen downe againe, or els resolued into pure and subtile ayre, and this mounting vp, and throwing downe is perpetuall.
               
                  Iupiter, when he had thus enlarged his father, vsurped his crowne and royall dignitie bannishing Saturne into hell, or the infernall regions. Historically, Iupiter hauing freed his father from thaldome, tooke vpon himselfe the dignitie and regiment of Creete, enforcing Saturnus to flie into Italie; where he was honored liuing and dying as a God: for, such was the custome of that age to attribute diuine honors and titles vnto them as Gods, of whom they receaued any goodnesse: as they did indeede of this Saturnus, who taught them how to till and manure the ground, to coyne money of mettale, which before was of leather, to leaue bushes and caues, and liue more ciuily and orderly, and to obserue certaine lawes and constitutions by him inuented, as appeareth by Virgil. S. Aeneid. who therefore calleth that time, the Golden age. Now in truth Italy was then far inferior to Greece in Wealth and Dignitie, and might therefore be called the infernall region, or base and lowe countrey in respect of 
                     
                        •
                     aturns florishing kingdome: as also, for that Italie is lower then Greece, as inclining more to the west; and it is an vsuall thing, for men to call the East, the superior or higher region, and the West, he lower, downecast, and inferior; or lastly, as Varro wil haue it, qd 
                  latet Italia inter praecipitia Alpium &amp; Apennini: because Italie doth, as it were, lurke and lie hidden betweene the abrupt and high toppes of the Alpes &amp; the Mountaine Apenninus. That this is true which I report, of his being in Italie, besides the testimonie of Virgil in the place aboue alleaged (where he saith that Italie, was named Latium, a Latendo, because Saturne did lurke and lie there, to hide himselfe from his sonne Iupiter.) Ouid also will beare me witnes, who in the first of his Fasti, concluding this matter, saith, that for an eternall memoriall of his arriuall and good institutions, the Italian posteritie in their money of mettale, figured the ship wherein he came vnto them.
               
                  At bona posteritas puppim formauit in aere,
                  Hospitis aduentum testificata dei.
               
               Allegorically, as before; when in any mans action or natiuitie Iupiter is predominant, then doth he controle Saturne, depriuing him of his power and dominion, and driuing him out as his inferior. Sabinus thinketh that Saturne was therefore saide to be driuen into the infernal dungeons, for that he is of all other Planets, the most remote and furthest from the earth, making that infinite and vnmeasurable height of Heauen, to be this Tartarus, this infernall or strange and far remoued region. But the most conceipted allegory for this

purpose, is that folowing: for although that in Saturns time and raigne, that is, by the in
                     •
                  luence and vertue of this Planet Saturne, the seede is preserued in the bowels of the earth, and congcaled or thickned in the bodies of sensible cretures at the first generation and conception; yet when these things are brought forth and receaue increase and augmentation, then doth Iupiter shew himselfe to be King, and dealeth all in all, driuing out olde Saturne into corners, and blinde and obscure places, where the first seedes of things lie hidden, which only are subiect to Saturnus iurisdiction.
               Time is swift and euerpassing without stay: which may bee the cause why Saturne is changed to a swift courser, when his wife tooke him dallying with Philyra, of whom he begat Chiron the Centaure as hereafter will appeare.
               Thus haue wee the good olde Saturne in his raggs, with his foure children before him, his consuming syth in his right hand, and a stone couered with cloth put to his mouth, with the left hand.
               Out of Eusebius, he may be thus also figured: himselfe couered with a long roabe: two eyes before, as many behinde: of which foure, two did euer watch, whilest other two slept: foure wings were fastned to his shoulders, two spread foorth, as though he were ready to flie, two pluckt in, as though he meant to stand still: he had also two wings at his head. The foure eyes and wings note, that Time, though it seeme to sleepe, yet alwaies watcheth, and yet so watcheth, as it seemeth still to sleepe: and, as it standeth, it flyeth away, and yet in flying, after a manner standeth still. The two wings at his head are said to represent the intellectuall facultie and reasonable power of mans minde, the old Philosophers being of opinion, that the soule receaued from Saturnes spheare, the gift of reason and intelligence.

Vesta she is also called, because she is Vestita, that is, couered with corne and grasse as with a vesture: or, quia vistat, because she standeth by her owne force, quasi vista, according to that of Ouid in his Fasti.

great mother both of Gods and men, sith as well the Paegan Gods as men, being both mortall, must both acknowledge the earth their foundor and benefactor, whereof more in Tassoes Messagiero.

The Lyons note the mightie and Lyonlike operation of the celestiall bodies vpon the earth: or, that husbandmens bodies must be strong like Lions: or lastly, that the stoutest were tamed, and must liue and dye on and in the earth. Her scepter is a signe of earthly pompe and dignitie. Round about her be emptie and vacant seates; either, for that the earth hath alwaies places of habitation in store for succeeding people; or, for that houses, cities, and countries become many times desolate by pestilence, famine, sword, fire, or otherwise; or, because many regions were then thought to be vnhabitable. Isidorus maketh her hold a key in one hand; for that the earth is, as it were, closed and shut vp in the winter, fostring then and cherishing in her lap the seede, till spring time come, and then she openeth her selfe▪ and therefore is April so called of Aperio, quasi Aperilis, the open, or opening moneth, as Ouid doth expound it,
Aprilem memorant ab aperto tempore dictum.

                  Iupiters birth, who, as I said before, was by that meanes concealed frō his father Saturne: some referre the roundnes of the Taburs, to the roundnes of the earth, &amp; others there be who think that the Taburs and Cymballs did note the windes, stormes, clouds, &amp; thunders; al which come of the exhalatiōs of the earth, mounting vpwards. Pinus is sacred vnto Cybele, for that Atis a sweet young youth who she loued, was by her transformed into the same for pitie, seeing the poore boy (being reiected of her for violating his vowed virginitte) plague his owne body, by cutting off those partes wherewith he had offended. This Atis (saith Eusebius) representeth flowers which are fayre in shew, but fade and fall away, before they bring forth any fruite, which is the cause, that he is said to be depriued of his fructifying members, the tale is sweetly told by Ouid in his bookes de Fastis. Another Vesta they made to be Saturns daughter, signifying that vitall heate, which, dispersed all ouer and through the bowells of the Earth, giueth life to

all earthly things, On her seruice attended the Vestall Virgins in Rome, so called of their Mistres Vesta, of whom also Ouid in the same booke hath learnedly discoursed; among other things, adding this,

               In Saturns time, the harmeles simplicitie of his subiects gaue name to the golden age, as I said before; which by degrees declining to siluer, and brasse, in the end became all of yron. Then did Astraea leaue the polluted earth, and setled her selfe betweene the Starres called Leo and Libra, the Lyon, and the Balance, couering her face in the cloudes for griefe to behold such impietie. Allegorically, Astraea, of Astrum, a Starre, is celestiall and heauenly Iustice: a Iudge must be stout and of good courage, as a Lyon, least for feare of menaces he spare the due execution of iustice: yet he must also weigh each thing in an vpright ballance, that affection or corruption doe not peruert iudgement: Her face is couered with clouds: for, a Iudge must not behold the parties with affectionat and preiudicat eyes, seduced by wrath or drawne away by Partialitie.
               
                  Astraea thus gone, the Giants began to rebell: a bloudie broade, borne of Coelus his bloud, falling on the earth, when Saturne his sonne depriued him of his virility. Some other make them to be borne of Neptune and Iphimedea: Neptunes broode is furious and vnruly by reason of the superaboundant store of vnbridled humors: and Ihimedea, is nothing else but an obstinat and selfe-wild conceite and desire grounded in the minde, and not remoueable. These allegorically are seditious and rebellious subiects in a common wealth, or schismaticall and haereticall seducers in the Church. Iupiter, the King or supreame gouernour: the Giants, rebells or heretikes: the hills, their aspiring deseignes and accursed stratagems: Ioues lightning, the iust plague and confusion of such attempts: their serpentine feete signifie their permicious and poysonable policies, and their monstrous and most degenerate deformitie in opposing themselues against the commonwealth.

This Lycaon for his crueltie, is here transformed into a wolfe, which in Greeke is called

                  dation, is borrowed, by likelihood, out of Moyses, by adding thereunto the conceit of Deucalions and Pyrrhaes casting of stones behinde their backes for the renuing of our stony generation, For, both Lucian reporteth, that Deucalion entred an arke,

and beasts and fowles with him: and Plutarch, that he sent forth a Doue, which returning, brought a signe of the decreasing waters, all which agree with the historie of Noe. As for Deucalion, he is said to haue raigned sometime in Thessalia, which being for the most part drowned by sodaine waters, himselfe and his wife Pyrrha assembled on Mount Parnassus all such as escaped: and by their wisdome (figured by the oracle from Themis) brought them to be sociable againe, and multiplie as they did in former times.
               But all this while we forget the poore Prometheus, who yet lyeth groaning on the mountayne Caucasus, for stealing fyre from heauen to make his image lyue: and taketh it very vnkindely, that we haue, in this creation of the world, made noe mention of him, by whose bold enterprise, Man, the best part of the world, was both framed first, and quickned afterwards. Minerua, lyking Prometheus his woorke, bad him aske what he would that was in heauen, to furnish his begun woorkmanship: he aunswering, that, vnles he were there to see what was in heauen fit for his purpose, he could desire no certeyne thing, was brought vp thither by Minerua: where; seeing euery thing quickned with fire, he dre

               Historically, Prometheus is sayd to be the first who made any image of man, of clay, whence this poeticall imagination tooke his beginning, and by continuance of time grewe to this (by the accustomed policies of the olde deceauing serpent, who is euer ready to further Atheisme and 
                     •
                  dolatry) that Prometheus was honoured as a God, and had Temples dedicated, and Altars erected for his seruice accordingly. As apeareth by Pausanias, who reporteth, that in the Academy of Athens, there was an altar consecrated vnto Prometheus, and that at certaine times apointed for that purpose, diuers men came thither, and there lighted a number of burning brands, running with them one after an other all in a rowe to Athens, in such sort, that whosoeuer caryed his fire brand burning quite to the Citie, was reputed Victor: and if any mans brand were extinguished or put out by the way, he gaue place to his fellow folowing.
               Allegorically, Prometheus is the fore-seeing and fore-knowing of thinges before they come to passe (for soe the very woord importeth,) as Epimetheus is the knowledge which we get by the end and euent of things already past &amp; gone, whose daughter is Repentance. Prometheus was the sonne of Iapetus &amp; Themis: Iapetus is nothing els (saith Proclus) but the most quick motion of heauen, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

Remy Belleau bringeth in Prometheus lamenting in his Bergerie, Thus,

               A Roadian Syrinx was a Nymph most noble, amongst all
               
                  Naiades and Dryades, that, in olde times highly renowned
               
                  Arcadian fountaines and mountains euer aforded.
               Fleshly Satyrs, Fauni, Siluani dayly desired
               Braue bony Syrinx loue, yet loueles braue bony Syrinx
               
               Fleshly Satyrs, Fauni, Siluani dayly deceaued.
               
                  Syrinx tooke noe ioy in ioyes of Queene Cytheraea,
               
               But vowd life and loue, and hart and hand to Diana.
               
               Lyke to Diana she lyu'd, for a virgins lyfe she professed,
               Lyke to Diana she went, for in hunting roabes she delighted,
               And with bow and shafts stil practysd lyke to Diana;
               Onely the diffrence was, that, in-hunting-mighty Dianaes
               
               Bow, was made of gowld, and Syrinx bow of a cornell:
               Which noe great diffrence was not so greatly regarded,
               But that Nymphs and Gods eu'n so were dayly deceaued,
               And hunting Syrinx for mighty Diana reputed,
               So nere by Syrinx was mighty Diana resembled.
               
                  Pan, with a garland greene of Pinetree gayly bedecked
               Saw this Nymph on a time come back from lofty Lycaeus,
               
               And his rurall loue in rurall sort he bewraied.
               Scarce had he sayd, Bony sweete: but away went braue bony Syrinx,
               
               Went through hills and dales and woods: and lastly aryued,
               Where gentle Ladon with mylde streames sweetely resounded,
               
                  Ladon stopt her course, Ladon too deepe for a damsell.
               Then, quod Syrinx, Help, deare sisters; let not a virgin,
               
                  Immaculate virgin by a rurall Pan be defyled.
               Rather let Syrinx be a mourning read by the ryuer,
               Soe that Syrinx may be a mayden reade by the ryuer.
               By and by Syrinx was turnd to a reade by the ryuer:
               By and by came Pan, and snatcht at a reade for a Syrinx,
               
               And there sight and sobd, that he found but a seade for a Syrinx.
               
               Whilst Pan sighs and sobds, new tender reades by the whistling
               Wyndes, did shake and quake, and yeelded a heauy resounding,
               Yeelded a dolefull note and murmur like to a playning.
               Which Pan perceauing, and therewith greatly delighted,
               Sayd, that he would thenceforth of those reades make him a Syrinx.
               
               Then, when he had with wax, many reedes conioyned in order,
               His breath gaue them life: and soe Pan framed a Pastors
               Pipe, which of Syrinx is yet still called a Syrinx,
               
            
            
               SHort &amp; sweet, quod Elpinus; &amp; I meane not my self herein to be ouer-long. Pan therfore is sayd to haue two horns on his forehead, reaching vp euen to the heauens; a red &amp; fiery face, a long beard hanging down on his brest, a staffe and a Pipe compact of seauen reedes in his hande, a spotted and freckled skinne on his body, crooked, rough, and deformed lymmes, and legges like a Goate. Cupid and Pan contending for superiority, Pan had the woorst, and the worst was this, that he extreamely loued Syrinx, who extreamely hated him. Besides a certaine historicall discourse of an Arcadian, called Siluanus, who to ease his Loue-sittes, was much addicted to Musike, and first (as is reported,) found out the Pipe made of seauen reeds, there is in this tale a more philosophicall conceit. Pan in Greeke, as I sayd, signifieth, All▪ and doth both by name &amp; naturall lineaments betoken that vniuersall efficacy of nature, ruling and gouerning all. The two horns on his forehead reaching vp to heauen, represente the Arctike and Antarclike poles. His spotted skinne is the eight Spheare, distinguished with those heauenly lights of innumerable starres. his fiery face, conteyning two eares, two eyes, two nosethrills, and one mouth, proportionably shadow the fiery and bright nature of the seauen Planets, His long bristled beard and bush, be the beames of the Sunne, and other Planets and Starrs, whose influence is the cause of earthly generations. His crooked▪ rough, and deformed lymmes, are the foure Elements, and the bodies thereof made, which, compared with those aboue, are altogether rude and homely. His Goates feete &amp; leggs note out the crooked course of things terrestriall: for euen as Goats go neuer streight, nor continue any setled and direct co

                   vniversall nature affecteth and earnestly desireth a celestiall and perpetuall constancy

in these inferior bodies. Syrinx runs from Pan; soe doth immutable constancy forsake these inferior matters, which are dayly tossed to and fro, and continually subiect to tenthousand alterations. Syrinx in her maine flight is stopped and stayed by the Riuer Ladon: in like sort, the heauens and caelestiall bodies (which by reason of their continuall motion are like to a Riuer) dooe stay and bridle that wandring and inconstant constancy of inferior bodies: and though the heauēs thēselues, by reason of their perpetual motiō seeme somewhat varyable and inconstant, yet this their instability is indeed most stable, and motion immutable, noted by this spotles virgin transformed into reades, which being moued and breathed vpon by the life-inspiring Zephirus, yeelde this sweete melody; as those celestiall globes are said to doe, by the impulsion and direction of their intellectuall guydes and Spyrites. Hereupon is Pans pipe made of seauen reades, figuring that heauenly harmony of the seauen Planets, caused by their neuer-ending circumduction and reuolution. Pan lastly, besides his pipe, hath a staffe also, Sith by the stayed and setled motion of the seauen Planets, this vniuersall efficacie of nature ordereth the proceedings of these inferior bodies accordingly. The tale is told by Ouid, and Achilles Statius.

                  These Satyrs are sayd to be lytle Dandiprats, with two horns, crooked noses hayry and rough bodies, and goates feete. Plutarch writeth in Syllaes lyfe, that there was one of them caught not farre from Apollonia a city of Epirus, and brought to Sylla: which being by many interpreters demaunded who or what he was, vttred a kinde of voice, but such as no man vnderstood, it being a sound that resembled the neying of a horse togeather with the bleating of a Goate.
               It is reported, that Antony the Eremite, saw and spake with such a Satyre in the Desert of Egipt: who confessed that himself and his fellowes were but mortall creatures, inhabiting the wildernes, although the Gentiles seduced and blinded did honor them as Gods, calling them Fauni and Satyri: adding further, that he came as sent from his companions, desiring Antony to make intercession for them to his and their God, whom they did know and acknowledge, to haue come into the world to saue the world. Besides these rurall Gods, the auncient Poets perceauing that there was a life-giuing moysture and efficacie of humor, in trees, hilles, seas, flouds, lakes, wells, and such like, haue apoynted them their seuerall Nimphes and Deities, as Ladies of the same, hereof came these names, Dryades, Hamadryades, Ephidryades, Oreades, Napeae, Naiades, Limniades, and such others. The Satyrs aboue spoken of, by reason of their wanton and lasciuious nature, are made companions of Bacchus, the drunken God: but sith by talking of Pan, I haue thought of them here, I meane to leaue both him and them to their forrests and rurall harbors.

               Then she begins to demaunde, who brought that Cow to the pasture,
               Of what kynde shee came, and what man might be the owner.

               When she begins her griefe, and woefull case to remember,
               And would lyft vp her handes, to beseech vnmerciful Argus,
               
               Noe hands are left her, to beseech vnmerciful Argus.
               
               When she recounts her smart, and meanes her woe to be vttring,
               
                  Io lowes as a Cow, insteede of an heauy bewayling,
               
                  Io the lowing Cow frights Io the lasse, by the lowing.
               When to the syluer streames of fathers brooke she repayreth,
               Fathers syluer streames shewe daughters head to be horned,
               
                  Io the horned Cow, with her hornes feares Io the damsell.
               
                  Euery water-nymph stil lookt and gazed on Io,
               
               Neuer a water-nymph thought this same Cow to be Io,
               
               
                  Inachus her father still lookt and gazed on Io,
               
               
                  Ioes owne father did neuer thinck her his Io:
               
               And yet poore Io went euery day to the aged
               
                  Inachus: once himselfe pluckt grasse, and gaue to the heyfar:
               
                  Io the guift for giuers sake, very kindly receaued,
               And with streaming teares her fathers hand she besprinckled,
               Lykt and kissed his hand: and would haue gladly reuealed
               Her mischaunce; and this new transformation vttred,
               But stil, grones and lowes, insteede of woords, she deliu'red.
               At last, two letters with her hoofe shee prynts by the ryuer,
               
                  I, and, O, for a signe of late transfigured Io.
               
               
                  Inachus howld when he read this doleful letter of Io.
               
               
                  Inachus howld, and cride, and clipt disfigured Io,
               
               Hangd on her horns and neck: and art thou Io my daughter?
               
                  Io my daughter, alas, ô most vnfortunat Io.
               
               
                  Inachus euery where hath sought for beutiful Io,
               
               And now findes her a Cow, insteede of a beutiful Io.
               
               
                  Io better lost then found: for I lost her a braue lasse,
               But now haue found her, not a lasse, not a wench, not a woman,
               Found her a Cow, dumbe Cow, whose language is but a lowing:
               Whereas I, suspecting no such thing, sought for a husband
               For my deare Io, and Io hoapte for a yong son;
               
                  Io must haue calues for sons, and bull for a husband.
               
                  Inachus and Io thus leaning either on others
               Neck, complaind and wept: then coms illuminat Argus,
               
               And driues father away from daughters sight, to the fountains,
               And driues daughter away from fathers sight, to the mountains.
               
                  Iupiter impatient to behold disconsolat Io,
               
               Commaunds Mercurius, to deceaue vntractable Argus.
               
               
                  Mercury putts on his hat, takes staffe and wings in a moment,
               Flyes to the earth: where hat for a time, and wings he remoueth,
               And th'inchaunted staffe, as a sheepehooke, only reteigneth,
               And so plods to the downe with an oaten pipe as a pastor,
               And stil playes, as he plods, which strange mirth greatly delighted
               Cow-keeping Argus: who could not rest, til he called
               
                  Mercury vp to the mount. Now Mercury sits on a mountaine
               Hard by Argus side, and tells him there, of a purpose,
               This tale, and that tale: how worthily Phoebus Apollo
               
               Plagued prowd Niobe, and Pallas scorneful Arachne;
               And each tale had a song, and euery song had a piping.
               
                  
                  Argus twixt nodding and gaping lastly demaunded
               Who found out that pipe. Then Mercury gins to remember
               
                  Pan and Syrinx loue: but or halfe was brought to an ending,
               
                  Argus his hundred lights were all obscur'd with a darcknes,
               Al bade him good night. Here Mercury quickly repressed
               Both his pipe and voyce, and slumbring Argus he blessed
               With th'inchaunted staffe, that much more soundly he sleeped:
               By and by, fro the neck, his nodding head he diuided,
               And so by one clowd, one hundred starrs he eclipsed.
               
                  Iuno was all in a chafe; and Argus death she bewayled,
               And with self-same eyes her Peacocks traine she be-painted:
               And made poore Io, possest with an hellish Erinnis,
               
               Run fro the east to the west, and neuer finde any resting:
               Til by Ioues good meanes, fel Iunoe's fury relented,
               Forgaue poore Io, and gaue her leaue to be lightned,
               And, for a further blisse, to be call'd Aegyptian Isis.

                     aetas had now done: and Elpinus thus recontinued his intermitted labor. Iupiter in latine, is quasi Iuuans pater, that is, a helping father. In greeke he is called 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , à viuendo, of liuing, as being the autor and giuer of life. He reduced the old world from barbarisme to ciuilitie, he builded temples for the Gods, made lawes for men, and hauing subdued most part of the earth, diuided the same among his brethren and kinsfolke, reseruing to himselfe the mountaine Olympus, where he kept his court. Allegorically, these and the like be the effects and operations of this beneficiall planet Iupiter. Olympus, is of it selfe most high, passing the clowdes, the word is asmuch to say in Greeke, as, all and wholly light and bright, and so taken for heaven. Iupiter is commonly pictured sitting, sith the eternall Monarch of heauen, and earth, is alwaies immutable, one, and the same, and neuer subiect to any alteration. His vpper parts are bare and naked, the lower, couered and concealed, signifying, that those superior and celestiall spirites conceaue the hidden mysteries of Iupiter, who will not disclose himselfe to mortall men, dwelling on earth, and clogd with the heauie burden of a corruptible body. In his right hand he holdeth an all-ruling scepter, in his left, a sin-correcting lightning, and his Aeagle standeth by.

               The scepter noteth a temperate rule and moderate gouernement, correspondent to the mylde nature of that mercifull planet: yet he wanteth not a lightning to plague the wicked, which is therefore ascribed vnto him, sith he is middle betweene Saturne and Mars, whose contrary and repugnant qualities concurre both together in Iupiter, aswell the extremity of colde from the circle of Saturne, as the furious heate from the spheere of Mars, whose conflict and

strugling together causeth thunder and lightning: whereof there bee three kindes. The first, bright and cleare, of a most wonderfull piercing and subtile nature, melting gold, siluer, and brasse in a purse, the purse neuer tutcht, destroying the childe in the mothers wombe, the mother no way hurt, killing and spoyling a man, his garments not somuch as schorched. The second is that which burneth, and is red: the third is somewhat moyst, and burneth not, but maketh black and blew: which was the cause that his lightning was called Trisulcum. The Aegle is his byrde, as being, by report, neuer tutcht with thunder, but looketh directly on the burning beames of the sunne, and is King of birds, as Iupiter is Monarch among the Gods. Among trees, the oake is sacred vnto him: because in olde time, the oake by her ackorns, is said to haue giuen l
                     •
                  fe and foode, and Iupiter himselfe is the author of life. He maried his sister Iuno, so also called, à Iuuando, of helping. Allegorically, Iupiter noteth the celestiall and fierie region, Iuno the ayrie and inferior; and because that celestiall is immediately conioyned with this terrestriall, (and either of them is light and yeelding, leuis &amp; mobilis) they are called brother and sister: and sith the celestiall by reason of his heate is the agent, and the inferior because of her moysture the patient or recipient, they be therefore also Man and Wife, for without heate and moysture no procreation. But of Ioues mariage it were fitter time to speake, when Iuno his Wife comes in place. Now therefore to his Mynions and louetricks, which transformed him into sundry shapes of brute beasts: for this immoderate lust and wantonnes, is not onely beastlike it selfe, but maketh them also beasts which giue themselues ouer thereunto.
               For the matter remembred by Damaetas, I haue heard, that the Phaenicians did vsualy sayle to Argos in Greece: and being there on a time, when they had made shew of their marchandise, and diuers women of Argos (among which was also Io daughter to Inachus their King) came thither of purpose to buie; the Phaenicians tooke them away all to their ships, and brought them to Aegypt; where this Io was giuen in mariage to Osiris the Aegyptian King, surnamed Iupiter Ammon, as Diodorus Siculus maketh mention: and Io herselfe was afterwards among them honored for a goddesse, by the name of Isis. And because the Aegyptians, in respect of husbandrie, did with diuine seruice and ceremonies honor a Cow, thereupon the fable tooke his ground, that Io being stolne by Iupiter, was transformed to a Cow. The impression of a Cowes hoofe, resembleth a greeke ω with an 1 in the middle: whereupon it is said, that Io with her foo

The celestiall and heauenly power in Man, called reason or vnderstanding, figured by Mercurius, doth moderate, pacifie, and temper all those inordinate motions and affections proceding from that other facultie of the minde, proucking to wrath and anger. This cholerike and angry parte of mans mi

                  Iupiter conueyed away Europa, Agenors daughter in a Ship called, The Bull, which was the cause why hee is saide to rauish her by transforming himselfe into a Bull. In that hee was turned to a golden showre to obtaine Danae: we see, that golde ouerruleth, and that, as Cicero somewhere saith, Asellus auro onustus in castellum ascendere potest, an asse loaden with golde will enter any strong holde. Or else, Danae may represent mans soule, and Iupiters golden showre, the celestiall grace and influence deriued into our mindes from aboue. Niobe, for her excessiue pride and contempt of God, is worthily plagued, yea so extreamely plagued in those very thinges wherein she chiefely vaunted, that for very anguish of heart and vntolerable woe, shee is saide to bee turned to a dull and senceles marble stone. The like mischife befell Arachne, who being endued with excellent qualities, thought scorne of the goddesse which was her good Mistresse, and might haue beene her patronesse; and was therefore transformed to a spyder.
               
                  Elpinus hauing concluded this discourse, it was commaunded by the Lady regent, that because Iuno was by nature and mariage conioyned with Iupiter, they should also ioyntly be remembred, before any other of Saturns broode were medled withall. Fuluia therefore being apoynted for this narration, for that shee could not readily call to minde any memorable tale of Iuno herselfe, sang as foloweth of the Nymph Eccho, who was alwaies taken to be Iunoes daughter.

               This seemde strange for a while, but th'end proou'd all to be too true.

                     ssus (when he came at length to the sixteenth
               Yeare of his age, and might seeme either a boy, or a batchler)
               Had so louely a looke, soe sweete and cheareful a countnance,
               That Nymphes and Ladies Narcissus dayly desired:
               Yet soe loueles a looke, so prowd and scorneful a countnance,
               That Nymphes and Ladies, Narcissus dayly refused.
               
                  Eccho once a day, the resounding Eccho, that aunswers
               Euery question askt, and yet no question asketh,
               Saw this gallant youth, as he hunted a deere by the forrest.
               
                  Eccho the tatling Nymph was a true bodie then, not an onely
               Voyce, as now: although eu'n then that voyce was abridged
               Like as now: and this was done by Iuno the Empresse,
               Mother, as it was thought, to the prating Dandiprat Eccho.
               
               For when Ioue with Nymphs himselfe did meane to recomfort
               Here and there by the woods, and fetch his flings by the forrests,
               Shee with a long discourse her mother Iuno deteigned,
               Till Nymphs all were gone, and Ioues deuotion ended.
               
                  Iuno perceauing these tricks, cut short the deluding
               Tong of pratling elf: yet pratling elf thus abridged
               Of too much tatling and babling in the beginning,
               Vseth her ould custome, by redoubling words in an ending.
               Therefore when she see's Narcissus goe to the forrest,
               Step for step thither by a secret path she repayreth,
               Burning still for loue: and as she nearer aproacheth
               Vnto the loued boy, soe she more mightily burneth.
               How-many thousand times, poore soule, she desirde a desiring
               And intreating speech to the wandring boy to be vttring?
               But fatall nature would noe-way grant a beginning.
               And yet, what nature permits, she greedily listneth
               For some sound, which may make her to be quickly resounding.
               At last Narcissus from his hunting company straying
               Wisht and sayd, O God, that I could see, some-body comming.
               
                  Eccho repeated agayne these last words, Some-bodie comming.
               Some-bodie comming? Where? qd wandring hunter amased,
               Come then apace: And, Come then apace, poore Eccho replied.
               
                  Narcissus wonders, lookes back, see's noe-body comming;
               Why, qd he, callst-thou me, and yet stil runst fro my calling?
               Cryest and fliest? And, Cryest and flyest? were dolefuly doobled.
               
                  Then, qd 
                  Narcissus, let's meete, and both be together:
               
                  Eccho, these last words with most affection hearing,
               Answered him fiue times, Let's meete, and both be together,
               And soe runs to the boy, in a fond conceipt, fro the bushes,
               Clips him fast by the neck, and offers friendly to kisse him.
               But prowd boy, as prowd as fayre, disdainfuly frowning,
               Flies from her embracements, and sayes, Let greedie deuouring
               Boares and beares be my graue, if I euer yeeld to thy pleasure.
               
                  Eccho sayd nothing, but, I euer yeeld to thy pleasure.
               And, for griefe and shame to be too too proudly repulsed,
               Hides her-selfe in woods and caues, and dwels by the deserts,
               And yet loues him still, still pines with vnhappily louing.
               Careful loue, and sleeples cares brought Eccho to nothing,
               Nothing but bare bones with an hollow heauie resounding.
               For flesh was cleane gone, and quite consum'd to a powder,
               And life-giuing blood went all to an ayre from a vapor.
               Yea, very bones at last, were made to be stones: the resounding
               Voyce, and onely the voyce of forelorne Eccho remaineth:
               
                  Eccho remaineth a voyce, in deserts Eccho remaineth,
               
                  Eccho noc-where seene, heard euery where by the deserts.
               
                  Iuno laught no lesse, then when shee saw in Auernus
               
               Prowd Ixions wheele turne with reuolution endles.
               But th'ouer-weening princox, was iustly rewarded;
               Who, for not louing others soe loued his owne-self,
               That selfe-will, selfe-loue, as he saw himselfe in a fountaine,
               Made him loose himselfe, for a fading shade of his owne-self.
            
            
               THis tale being thus tolde by Fuluia, Elpinus tooke occasion thereby to discourse of Iuno much after this manner. Iuno, Ioues wife and sister, as I sayd before, is the Lady of mariage, and gouernesse of child-birth, called therefore Lucina, à Luce, sith she, as a coelestiall midwife, helpeth to bring forward the children in lucem, into light. These proprieties are assigned vnto her, for that she resembleth the vertue and efficacy of the ayre, and al this inferior composition, as I haue already tolde. Oceanus and Thetis brought her vp: the ayre is made of water rarified and subtiled. She brought foorth Vulcan vnto Iupiter: the ayre incensed and made hoate, breedeth fire. Homer maketh Iupiter binde Iuno with a golden chayne, hanging two great masses of Iron at her heeles, and that she thus tied, could be loosed by none, but by himself: Iuno is the ayre; the two weights of Iron, be the earth and water, betweene which two &amp; the superior bodies she hangeth chayned: &amp; this golden chayne is the cohoerent concatenation and depending of things vnited so in order, as none but only the almighty Iupiter can dissolue the same. The Peacock is Iunoes bird, and

draweth her chariot: Iuno is the goddesse of riches and honour, which are as glorious in shew, and as transitorie in truth, as the Peacoks spotted trayne, and make men as prowd and insolent, as a Peacocke, which in a vaunting and bragging conceipt▪ displayeth to the beholders, her feathers bespprinckled with Argus his eyes. Her Nymphs and handmayds expresse the variable change &amp; alteration of the ayre▪ portending either fayre or fowle weather, windes, stormes, rayne, hayle and such like: of whom Virgil maketh mention, 1. Aeneid. where Iuno offreth Aeolus the fayrest lasse of all her fourteene damsels.
               
                  Sunt mihi bis septem praestanti corpore Nymphae;
                  Quarum, quae forma pulcherrima, Deïopeiam,
                  
                  Connubio iungam stabili, propriam

                  Exigat, &amp; pulchra faciat te prole parentem.
               
               
                  Iuno might well command Aeolus, the king of windes, sith winde is nothing els but the ayre stirred, or an exhalation blustring in the ayre: therefore in that place Virgil maketh him thus answere Iuno.
               
               
                  Tuus ô regina, quid optes,

               Historically, Aeolus dwelling in a very hilly and windy countrie, perceaued and foretolde the mariners, by the flowing and reflowing of the seas, and such other Physical obseruations, what weather they should expect, noting and declaring vnto them before hand the sure and vnfallible tokens of the rising windes and tempests, whereupon he was called the king of windes, and his kingdome Aeolia, of his name: where he with his regall mace in his hand, pinneth vp those blustring brethren in his dungeons, barred with huge hils and mountaynes, as there Virgil also beareth witnes.

               The windes are painted winged, with swelling and puffing mouthes and cheekes, among the rest, Boreas hath this peculiar, that his feete be serpentine, according to his pinching and byting nature

               As Mercury is Iupiters messenger, so is Iris Iunoes. Iris hath her name 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   of speaking, for she speaketh and telleth when rayne is towards. Iris is the Rayn-bow, and Iuno is the ayre, wherein those raynie clowdes are cluttered together. Iris is the daughter of Thaumas and Electra: Thaumas is the sonne of Pontus, the sea, or water: and Electra is the daughter of heauen, or the sunne. Thaumas signifieth wondring and admiration, of 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and this bow, in truth, is euery way wonderful, by reason of those so many strange colours appearing therein. Electra is perspicuitie, or serenitie; of 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , the sunne, and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , bright and serene: so this bow proceedeth from water and serenitie, to weete from the reflexion of the sunnes beames, in a watery clowde. Iuno her selfe sitteth on a throne, with a scepter in her hand, a crowne on her head, and her Peacocke standing by her.
                     Iunoes picture.
                  
               
               
                  Iupiter iesting with Iuno, whether man or woman had more pleasure, the matter was referred to Tiresias, who had been both woman and man: but giuing sentence with Iupiter, was depriued of his sight by Iuno. It is not good therefore to iudge betweene our betters. Tiresias was a sage and contemplatiue man: and such are commonly blinde to other matters, for that they scorne these inferior things, as hauing vowed their whole soules to more heauenly cogitations. Eccho is Iunoes daughter, for she is nothing els, but the reuerberation and reduplication of the ayre. Eccho noteth bragging and vaunting▪ which being contemned and despised, turneth to a bare voyce, a winde, a blast, a thing of nothing. Narcissus is a louer of himselfe, and so it falleth out, that vaunting and bragging loues self-loue: He is turned to a flower, florishing to day, and fading to morrow, as such ouerweeners alwayes doe.
               
                  Ixion graced by Ioue, would needes dishonour Iuno: Iupiter framed a counterfait Iuno, intruth nought but a clowde: which Ixion vsing in stead of Iuno, begat the Centaures. This is a note of ambitious and aspiring loue, And these Centaures hereupon were called Nubigenae. Historically they liued in high mountaines in Thessalia, which gaue occasion to this fiction. They were called halfemen, for that being practised in riding, they grew most expers therein, sitting on horses continually, so that they seemed not men and horses distinct, but a thing made of horse and man together. These rude fellowes enraged with wine and lust, set all on an vprore at Pyrithous his wedding.
               
                  
                  But to returne to Eccho, I remember an odde conceited dialogue between her &amp; the affectionate louer, which as I heard it of late of a forren Pastor, so here for nouelties sake, I repeate it: that some of our company may another time either worke on the same ground, or lay himselfe a new foundation.

                  Philoueuia, being next by turne, was willed to remember what she could concerning the watery Nymphs &amp; Ladies of the seas; that therby Elpinus might shew his conceipt touching Neptune, the second heire of Saturnus. And this was her song.
            
            
               
                  SCilla sate her down, then a mayd, now changd to a monster,
               Sate her down on a banck with sea-borne Dame Galathea,
               
               Down on a flowring banck, not far from sulphurus Aetna.
               
               And there gan to recount ten thousand wilie deuises,
               Wherewith poore young youths in scornful sort she deluded.
               Yea, but alas, sayd then, with a far-fet sigh Galathea,
               
               They that seeke thy loue, yet suffer dayly repulses,
               Beare mens face, mens heart, and so are safely repulsed.
               But Galathea the wretch, (ô woful wretch Galathea)
               
               Could not auoyd leawd lust and rage of lout Polyphemus,
               
               Capten of Aetna'es f
                     •
                  ends, but alas, but alas with a danger,
               Nay with a death, ô death: and there grief stopt Galathea.
               
               At length, inward woe with weeping somwhat abated,
               Thus, for Scillaes sake her dearlings death she remembred.
               There was (woe worth was) was a fayre boy, beautiful Acis,
               
               
                  Acis, Faunus boy, and boy of louely Simethis,
               
               
                  Acis, Faunus ioy, and ioy of louely Simethis,
               
               Best boy of Faunus, best boy of louely Simethis,
               
               Most ioy of Faunus, most ioy of louely Simethis:
               
               And yet better boy, and greater ioy by a thousand
               Parts, to the blessed then, but now accurst Galathea,
               
               Then to the syre Faunus, to the mother louely Simethis,
               
               As Galathea thus did loue her beautiful Acis,
               
               So Polyphemus alas did loue his lasse Galathea,
               
               And Galathea still did loath that lusk Polyphemus.
               
               O deare Lady Venus, what a sou'raigne, mighty, triumphant,
               And most imperious princesse art thou in Olympus?
               
               This rude asse, brute beast, foule monster, sidebely Cyclops,
               
               This Polyphemus loues: this grim Polyphemus, a mocker
               Of both Gods and men: this blunt Polyphemus, a terror
               Vnto the wildest beasts: this vast Polyphemus, a horror
               Eu'n to the horrible hils and dens, where no man abideth,
               This Polyphemus lou's, and doates, and wooes Galathea:
               
               Forgoes his dungeons, forsakes his vnhospital harbors,
               
                  Leaues his sheepe and Goates, &amp; frames himself to be finish,
               Learns to be braue, forsooth, and seeks thereby to be pleasing,
               Cuts his bristled beard with a syth, and combs with an Iron
               Rake, his staring bush, and viewes himselfe in a fishpond;
               And there frameth a face, and there composeth a countnance,
               Face for a diu'ls good grace, &amp; countnance fit for a hell-hound.
               His bloodthirsting rage, for a while is somwhat abated,
               His brutish wildenes transformd to a contrary mildenes:
               Strangers come and goe, sail-bearing Ships by the Cyclops
               
               Passe and safely repasse, and neuer feare any danger;
               This Polyphemus now, is changd from that Polyphemus.
               
               
                  Telemus in meane time, as he sayld by Sicilian Aetna,
               
               
                  (Telemus in birds-flight had a passing singuler insight)
               Came to the ougly Gyant, and said, that he should be depriued
               Of that his one broad eie (which stood there filthily glooming
               In middle forehead) by crafts-contriuer Vlysses.
               
               Blinde foole, qd 
                  Polypheme, can a blinde man loose any eie-sight?
               Poore Polypheme of his eye was by Galathea depriued
               Long since, and cares not for crafts-contriuer Vlysses.
               
               Thus contemning that which after proued a true-tale,
               Either in hellish caues his diu'lish carkas he rouzeth,
               Or, by the shaking shore and sea-side lazily stalketh,
               Or, very rockes themselues with a lubbers burden he crusheth.
               There was a hill, that stretcht with sharpned point to the sea-ward,
               And had both his sides with Neptune dayly bedashed:
               Hither he climes, and here his cart-load lims he reposeth,
               Here his fellow Goates, and Rams, and Sheepe he beholdeth:
               Then layes downe his staffe (his walking staffe was a Pine-tree,
               One whole huge Pine-tree, that might wel serue for a main mast
               Vnto an Armado) and after, takes vp a iarring
               Pipe (fit for piper Polypheme, fit lute for a lowby)
               Compact of fiue-score and fifteene reedes, with a clumsie
               Fist, and scrapes, and blowes, and makes so shameful an out-cry.
               That both lands and seas did groane with a deadly resounding,
               Hearing this fowle Swad such rustical harmony making;
               For there vnder a rock, as I lay, and leaned in Acis
               
               Lap, this song I did heare, and beare with a heauy remembrance.
               More white then Lillies, then Primerose flowre Galathea,
               
               More fresh then greene grasse, more slyke &amp; smooththē a cockle
               Shell, thats washt and worne by the sea, more coy then a wanton
               Kyd, more brigt then glasse, more ioy to the heart then a winters
               Sunne, or sommers shade, more fayre and seemly to looke on
               
                  Then straight vp-mounting plante-tree, more cleare then a Christall
               Streame all froz'n, more woorth then a hoorde of melloed apples,
               More sweete then ripe grapes, more soft then downe of a cignet,
               And, (so that thou couldst accept poore woorme Polyphemus)
               
               More deare then Diamond to the louing woorme Polyphemus.
               
               And yet more stubborne then an vntam'de Ox, Galathea,
               
               More light then floating billowes, more hard then an aged
               Oake, more rude then a rock, more tough then twig of a Willow,
               More violent then streame of a brooke, more fierce then a wilde-fire,
               More sharpe and pricking then thorns, more prowd then a Peacock,
               More spiteful then a troaden snake, more curst then a whelping
               Beare, more deafe then seaes, and (which most greeues Polyphemus)
               
               More swift-pac't then a Hart, then winged windes, Galathea.
               
               O, but alas, run not, looke back, and know Polyphemus.
               
               My bowre with maine rocks and mounts is mightily vawted,
               That scalding sunbeames in summer neuer aproach it,
               And blustring tempests in winter neuer anoy it:
               My trees bend with fruite, my vines are euer abounding
               With grapes, some like gold, some others like to the purple:
               And both golden grapes, and purpled grapes be reserued
               For my sweete purpled, my golden wench Galathea.
               
               Thou with thine owne hands maist easily pluck fro the bushes
               Blackbery, hipps, and hawes, and such fine knacks by the forrest,
               Damsons, sloes, and nutts: and if thou wilt be my wedded
               Wife, each tree and twig, and bush shall bring thee a present,
               Euery bush, twig, tree, shall serue my wife Galathea.
               
               All these sheepe be my owne, which quickly without any calling
               Come and run to the pipe of their good Lord Polyphemus:
               
               And many thousands more, which either range by the mountains,
               Or feede in valleys, or keepe their places apointed
               And stalls hard by my bowre: and if thou aske me the number
               Of them, I know it not, for beggers vse to be telling
               How-many sheepe they keepe, my goodes, Galathea, be endles,
               My sheepe nomberles: yet among these so-many thousand
               Flocks of sheepe, not a sheepe did I euer prooue to be fruitles.
               Thou thy-self maist see my goates and sheepe to be stradling
               With bagging vdders, thou maist see how-many lambkins,
               And yong kyds I doe keepe, kyds and lambs both of a yeaning.
               Milke I doe neuer want, and part I reserue to be drunken,
               Part in curds and cheese, with thrift I prepare to be eaten.
               Neither shall my loue Galathea be only presented
               With birds neasts, kyds, doues, and such like paltery stale-stuffe,
               
                  And common loue-toyes, which easily may be aforded
               By each carters swaine: Polyphemus found on a mountaine
               Two braue yong Beare-whelps, either so like to an other,
               That who marks not well, will soone take one for an other:
               These did I finde of late, and these doe I keepe for a token,
               For to be playfellowes for my bonilasse Galathea.
               
               O then scorne not me, scorne not my guiftes, Galathea;
               This body shalbe thy spoyle, and this bloud shalbe thy bootie,
               These sheepe shalbe thy goods, and these hills shalbe thy dowry.
               Sweete pig, scorne not mee; for I know myselfe to be comely,
               Often I looke in a lake, and set my selfe by a fishpond,
               Making mine owne eyes of mine owne eyes the beholders,
               And when I see my face, I delite my face to be seeing.
               Looke how big I doe looke, how strong and stordily squared,
               Mark how mighty I am: no thundring Ioue in Olympus,
               
               (You fooles tell many tales of a thundring Ioue in Olympus)
               
               No great thundring Ioue is greater then Polyphemus.
               
               See what a swinging bush giues cou'ring vnto my countnance,
               And, as a thickset groaue, makes dreadful shade to my shoulders.
               My Flesh's hard indeede, all ouer-grown with a bristled
               Hyde, and rugged skin; but that's but a signe of a mans hart,
               And is no-more shame to the strong and stowt Polyphemus,
               
               Then broade leaues to a tree, then faire long mane to a foming
               Steede, then synnes to a fish, then feathers vnto a flying
               Fowle, or woolle to a sheepe. One eye stands steedily pitched
               In my front: but an eye, yet an eye as broade as a buckler.
               And what, I pray you, hath this sunne any more but his one eye?
               And yet he sees all things, and all things only with one eye.
               Lastly, my syre Neptune with threeforckt mace, as a sou'raigne
               Rul's in Sea's: and so shall sea-borne dame Galathea
               
               By taking Polypheme, best ympe of Seaes, for a husband,
               Haue also Neptune, chiefe Lord of Seaes, for a father,
               Earth-shaking Neptune, that stroue with mighty Minerua
               
               For the renowned Athens (as he often towld me his own-selfe)
               And raisd vp Troy walls with threatning towres to the heauens:
               With whose rage both Lands and seaes are fearefuly trembling,
               At whose beck springs, wels, floods, brooks, pooles, lakes be obeying,
               As soone as they heare his Triton mightily sounding.
               Then, Galathea relent, and yeeld to thy owne Polyphemus,
               
               Sith Polyphemus yeelds himselfe to his owne Galathea,
               
               Sith Polyphemus yeelds: who cares not a rush for a thundring
               Heu'n, and heauens King: thy frowning's worse then a thousand
               
                  Lightnings and thunders. Yet I could forbeare thee the better.
               If thou didst aswell scorne others, as Polyphemus.
               
               But why should Galathea refuse well growne Polyphemus.
               
               And yet like and loue and wooe, effoeminat Acis?
               
               Whome if I catch, Ile make him know, that great Polyphemus
               
               Arm's as strong as great. Ile paunce that paltery princox,
               Trayle his gutts by the fields, and teare his flesh in a thousand
               Gobbets, yea ile powre his bloud, hart-bloud to the waters:
               Eu'n thine owne waters, if I euer take Galathea
               
               Dealing with that boy, dwarfe Acis, dandiprat Acis,
               
               Elfe Acis: for I boyle with most outragius anger
               And most raging loue: me thinkes whole sulphurus Aetna.
               
               
                  Aetna with all his flames in my brest makes his abiding,
               And yet neither loue nor wrath can moue Galathea.
               
               Thus when he had this sweete loues lamentation ended,
               Vp-gets th'one eyde feende, and rangeth abroade by the forrest,
               Roaring out, as a bull, driu'n back with force from a heyfar:
               And at length spies out vs two there downe in a valley,
               Mee and Acis alas vnawares; and cries in a fury,
               Endles griefe and shame confound forelorne Polyphemus.
               
               If that I make not now your loue toyes all, to be ended.
               This did he roare, but he roarde this with so hellish an outcry,
               That mount Aetna with eccho resounds, and griesly Typhoeus
               
               Groanes for feare, and breaths foorth flashing flames to the heauen

                  Cerberus had broke loose with three-throate iawes to the heauens.
               Here I alas for feare, dopt vnderneath the reflowing
               Waues, and poore Acis fled back, and cride, Galathea,
               
               Helpe, Galathea, help; and let thy boy be receaued
               In thy watery boures, Polyphemus murdereth Acis.
               
               
                  Cyclops runs to a rock in a rage, and teares in a fury
               One greate peece, as big as a mount, and hurl's it at Acis:
               
               And but a litle peece thereof tutcht bewtiful Acis,
               
               Yet that litle peece orewhelmd whole bewtiful Acis.
               
               Here I alas, poore wretch, wrought all that desteny suffred
               For to be wrought, and causd his strength to be freshly renued,
               His life eu'n by a death now more and more to be lengthned,
               And his dearest name and fame to be dayly remembred,
               And my selfe and him, by a heauy diuorce, to be ioyned.
               
                  His blood sprang fro the lumpe; his blood first cherefuly purpled,
               Then by degrees it changd, and rednes somewhat abated,
               And lookt like to a poole troubled with raine from Olympus,
               
               Afterwards, it clearde: then lumpe cloaue, and fro the cleauing,
               Flowring reades sprang forth, and bubling water abounded.
               Beutiful Acis thus was then transformd to a horned
               Brooke; and yet this brooke tooke name of bewtiful Acis.
               
               
                  Acis a louing streame, runs downe with a louely resounding,
               Downe to the great sou'raigne of seaes with speedy reflowing,
               There, his yearely tribute to the three-forckt God to be paying▪
               
               And there, his Galathea for euermore to be meeting.
               Here Galathea did ende: and coy dame Scylla departed:
               Whom sea-God Glaucus (new God, late made of a fisher)
               Lou'd, but vnhappily lou'd: and wept, when he saw her a monster.
            
            
               THen, quoth Elpinus, Neptune was the second of the three brethren and sons of Saturne, which had the whole frame of the world parted among them; Ioue had the heauens, Neptune the seaes all the rest was Plutoes. Historically, as some thinke, Ioue had the East, Pluto the West, Neptune the seacosts: howsoeuer, Neptune is soueraigne of the seas, who also many times shaketh with his imperiall mace the very foundations of the earth, according to that of Ouid,
                  
                     Ipse tridente suo terram percussit, at illa
                     Intremuit, motu

For, in coast adioyning to the sea, earthquakes and inundations of waters are most vsuall. Homer for this cause calleth Neptune

                  , Earth-shaker. And as Pallas was president of Towres, and Iuno a gouernesse of Gates, so Neptune had care of the groundworkes and foundations of buildings; which are neuer said to be firme, vnles they be laide as deepe as the water. Therefore as Neptune was hired by Laomedon to builde those stately walls of Troy, so in the subuersion of the same, himself is as busie afterwards, as apeareth by that of Virgil 2. Aeneid.

                   sent ambassadors to Tiberius Caesar, giuing him to vnderstand, that in then countrey, there was one of these Tritons seene and heard singing: being a sea-monster, resembling a man by his vpper partes, and a fish by those belowe this colour was like the sea-water; his skinne hard with shels: and is called Neptunes trumpeter, to sound the retreite, when his master would haue the sea to be calme; because when he is heard thus singing, or seene apearing in the water, it is a signe of calme and fayre weather. Neptunes mace is also Tridens, threeforked, for that there is a triple and threefold vertue in waters, the first in wells, which are sweete: the second in seaes, and they are salte: the third in lakes, being vnpleasant and vnsauory: or rather, because euery one of the three brethren hath somewhat to doe in euery part of the tripertite kingdome: which may also be a cause why Iupiters lightning is also Trisulcum, and Plutoes Scepter Tridens. For albeit Iupiter is especially predominant in heauen, Neptune in the seaes, and Pluto in the lower regions; yet that almighty and all-ouerruling power is indifferently aparant in euery of these three kingdomes, and in heauen is called Iupiter, in seaes Neptune, below Pluto, whome therefore Virgil calleth stigium Iouem, the stigian Iupiter.

                  ficacie of nature ruling in seaes &amp; deeps. She is called Amphitrite of compassing, enuyroning, or turning about, as the sea embraceth and incloseth the earth. Neptune had an infinite number of sons and daughters: moysture is fit for generation; which was the cause that Thales the Philosopher made water to be the ground and beginning of euery thing; and Virgil calleth the sea, the father of things,
Oceanumque patrem rerum.

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , swift, for so is the flowing of the sea. When Neptune was kept from Saturnes deuouring mouth, his mother shewed a colt, insteede of him: and when Pallas and Neptune contended, who, as most beneficiall, should giue name to Athens, he with his mace stroke the earth, whence issued a horse: either for that a horse is swift, and the sea is violent; or because Neptune first taught how to ride a horse; or by reason that a horse loueth plaines and large places, where free scope is to run, as is the sea, for that cause called, aequor. Therefore the Romaine sports called Ludi circenses, wherein the race of horses was vsual, were celebrated in honor of Neptune; and Horace maketh Vlysses his sonne speake thus to Menelaus,
                  
                     Non est aptus equis Ithacae locus, vt neque planis

Galathea is so called of whitenes, and noteth the very froath of the Sea. Humor and moysture be the chiefe causes of augmentation; Neptune therefore, as hee hath many children, so hath hee some of them great and monstrous; among others, Polyphemus: who, though vast and rude, yet loued, (such is the force of loue) but loued like a lowte, such is the home-borne education of rurall clownes. Polyphemus, as the rest of that rout, was called Cyclops, of 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                  , as hauing but one round eye in his forehead; in truth meaning a buckler, framed round like an eye, although Seruius doe otherwise expound it. Hee is reported to bee a bloudy and theeuish manqueller, robbing and spoyling all along the Sicilian shore: from whome Vlisses wiselie esc

                  ped, and was therefore said to haue bored out his great eye with a firebrand. This tyran Polypheme loued a noble Lady named Galathea, but could not obteine her: at last, vsing force for law, kept her violently: and perceauing that she affected one Acis, more then himselfe, murdered the youth Acis, and threw his bodie into a riuer, which thereof bare that name. Allegorically, as some will haue it, Polyphemus is a miserable and worldly keeper of sheepe and kine: he loueth Galathea the Lady of milke: and, knowing that moyst places be best for milke, cannot abide, that Galathea should come nere Acis, a riuer in Sicilia, whose naturall proprietie was saide to be such, as that it would drie vp and consume milke.
               
                  Glaucus loued Scylla: but being reiected of her, he intreated Circe to make her affectionate by charming. Circe at first sight falleth in loue with Glaucus, who in like sort refuseth her, whereupon she infecting the waters where Scylla vsually bathed herselfe, transformed her into a monster, which afterwardes became a rock. This Glaucus, perceauing the fish which he had caught, by tasting a certaine herbe, presently to leap againe into the water, himselfe, for triall, did pluck and eate, and by vertue thereof transformed, threw himselfe also into the sea: where he was deified. The tale is reported by Ouid in the end of the thir

                  eenth and beginning of the fourteenth of his transformations, and expounded by Tasso in the second part of his dialogue, entituled Gonzago, ouero del piacer honesto: where, by the deified Glaucus, he vnderstandeth the intellectual part and facultie of man: by the sea wherein he fisheth, the body and all bodily matters, being the matter subiect of naturall philosophie, and subiect to continuall alteration like the sea: by his fishing, the discoursing and sylogisticall reasoning of Intellectus: by his netts: the instruments of naturall

Logick: by the fishe caught, those generall maximaes▪ and vniuersal grounds, and true conclusions and consequences: by the herbe which he did bite, the heauenly delite of contemplation, whereby he was made a God: by the casting of himselfe into the sea, his comming and descending from the quiet rest of contemplation, to the variable sea of action and operation, figured also by the double shape and twoforked tayle of Glaucus and the other sea-Gods. Thus doth Tasso transforme Glaucus to a God: and by a little turning of his exposition, he turneth him thus to a brute beast. Glaucus, by tasting the herbe, leapeth into the sea, together with his fishes: that is, by yeelding to the inchaunting force of pleasure, he so drowneth himselfe in the Aphrodisian sea of sensuality, that he becomes altogether beastlike.
               Historically, Scylla and Charibdis were two rocks in the Sicilian sea. Scylla had that name 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , of spoyling; or 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , of vexing: or else 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , of whelps or dogs, sith the beating of the waues vpon the rocke, made a noyse like the barking of curs. Charibdis was so called 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , of gaping, and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , to sup vp, or deuoure.
               By Typhoeus, Sabinus vnderstandeth the burning and flaming exhalations, cause of that fire in Aetna: which clustred together, and wanting free p

It seemeth, that the violent fury of the windes, is here also shadoed by Typhoeus: for, his hands reach from East to West, and his head to heauen, agreeing with the nature of the seuerall windes blowing in euery coast of Heauen. His body is couered with feathers, noting the swiftnes of the windes: about his legs are crawling adders, so the windes are oftentimes pestilent and hurtfull, his eyes are red as fire, and he breathes flames out of his mouth; for, the windes are made of hoate and dry vapors.

They are crowned with reades: reades grow plentifully in watery places, they are figured with long hayre and beard, like a man, alwaies lying, leaning on one elbow, or on some great vessell, whence water issueth aboundantly. I neede not make any explication hereof, all is so manifest.

               Among other sea-borne monsters the Mermaides must not be forgotten, they had the face and proportion of women to the waste, &amp; thence downewards, the resemblance of fishes: some others giue them wings, and scraping feete, like the feete of hens: they were three, Parthenope, that is, Virgins face: Leucosia, white and faire, and Ligia, which is, sounding. They were borne of Achelous, noting moysture, and the muse Calliope, that is, faire spoken: the one

sang, the other sounded a trumpet, the third played on a lute, so sweetely, that such as sayled, were enticed thereby to the dangerous rocks where they frequented. Vlysses being to passe that way, commaunded his companions to stop their owne eares with wax, and then fasten him to the mast of the ship, least that inchaunting melodie might be their bane: which policie did so confound the Sirenes with shame and sorrow, that they thereupon threw themselues headlong into the sea. Ouid maketh them Proserpinaes companions, who losing their Lady and Queene, were thus made birds in part, and yet reteigned their former face and beautie. Suidas saith, that in truth, they were certaine blinde and dangerus rocks, which by the breaking and beating of the billowes, did make such a sweetely resounding murmur, that it allured the passengers thither, to their owne destruction. Whatsoever they were, Allegorically they signifie the cosning tricks of counterfeit strumpets, the vndoubted shipwrack of all affectionat yonkers: and therefore is it said by Virgil, that the Mermaydes rocks are all ouer spread with bones of dead men, whose destruction their deceaueable allurements had procured. Xenophon is of this minde, that the Sirenes did learnedly and sweetely extoll the famous acts of renowned men: and that therefore Homer maketh them entertain Vlysses with their pleasing voyce, who indeede was for politick stratagems the chiefe ornament of Greece: and no doubt, these sweete and glorious commendations of great mens exploites, are the most effectuall charmes, to worke any impression in an heroicall minde, and with this conceite of Xenophon, Cicero doth also agree.

               Of the marine monsters, Proteus yet remayneth: who being King in Aegypt, did so wisely apply himselfe, and frame his wit to euery particular accident, that he was said to turne and transforme himselfe to any kinde of shape. Some referre this to the custome obserued of the Aegyptian kings, who neuer came abroade, but hauing some one or other ensigne on their head, as a token of their imperiall maiestie: and this they changed continually; sometimes vsing the image of a Lyon, sometimes of a Bull, sometimes this, and sometimes that, which variety gaue ground and occasion to this fable. It is reported, that hee raigned in the Isle Carpathus, whereof, the Carpathian sea by Aegypt, had his name: which because it had great store of sea-calues and other sea monsters, Proteus himselfe was called Neptunes heardsman, keeping his seaish flocks. Cornelius Gemma, in his booke de diuinis naturae characterismis allegorically expoundeth this tale out of the fourth of Virgils Georgicks, making Proteus, a type of nature. Plato compareth him to the wrangling of brabling

sophisters: and some there be that hereby vnderstand, the truth of things obscured by so many deceauable apparances: Lastly, there want not others, which meane hereby the vnderstanding and intellectual parte of mans minde, which vnles it seriously and attentiuely bend it selfe to the contemplation of things, shall neuer attaine to the truth, as Proteus would neuer reueale his propheticall knowledge, but first did turne and winde himselfe euery way to escape, vntil with bands he were enforced thereunto, as Homer (the first author of this inuention) in the fourth of his Odyssea discourseth at large.
               Lady Proserpina, with her mother Ceres, fell to Amaryllis, who by talking of them, discoursed also of Pluto, and so made an end of the three mightie Monarchs of the world.
            
            
               
                  PLuto the Duke of diu'ls, enrag'd with an hellish Erynnis,

               For that he wanted a wife: and now eu'n all the detested
               Infernal rablement, and loathsome broode of Auernus
               
               Clustred on heapes and troupes and threatned wars to Olympus.
               
               But Lachesis, fearing lest laws layd down by the thundrer,
               By the reuenging rout of feends might chance to be broken,
               Fate-spinning Lachesis cry'd out to the prince of Auernus.
               
               Sou'raigne Lord of damned Ghosts, and mightie Monarcha
               Of Stygian darknes, which giu'st each thing a beginning,
               And by thy dreadful doome, doest draw each thing to an ending,
               Ruling life and death with iurisdiction endles;
               O let those decrees and fatal lawes be obeyed,
               Which wee three sisters for you three brethren apoynted:
               Let that sacred league and peace last freely for euer;

               Though not well calmed, yet he yeelds at last to the fatall

               And a repyning heart, and Mercury sends to Olympus
               
               With this round message: Tell Ioue that stately triumpher,
               
                  Pluto cannot abide to be thus controll'd by a brother,
               Imperius brother: who though that he maketh a rumbling
               With scar-crow thunders, and hurls his flames in a fury
               On poore mortall men; yet he must not think that Auernus
               
               Vndaunted Capten, with buggs can so be deluded.
               Is't not enough that I liue in darksome dens of Auernus,
               
               Where fire, smokes, &amp; fogs, grief, plagues, &amp; horror aboundeth,

                  But that he must also forbid me the name of a husband,
               And restraine those ioyes which nature freely afordeth?
               Seas-sou'raigne Neptune embraceth his Amphitrite,

               Vnto my full content, Ile loose forth all the reuengful

               Ile confound heau'n, hell, light, night, Ile cast on a cluster

               That Stygian brother, should take Proserpina, daughter
               Vnto the Lady Ceres, pereles Proserpina: matchles,
               And yet fit for a match. Bloody Mars, and archer Apollo
               
               Sought her a long while since; Mars big &amp; fram'd for a buckler,
               
                  Phoebus fit for a bowe, Mars actiue, learned Apollo:
               
               
                  Mars offred Rhodope, Phoebus would giue her Amyclas,
               
               And Clarian temples, and Delos fayre for a dowrie.
               Lady Ceres cast off bloody Mars, and archer Apollo,
               
               Contemning Rhodope, despising proffred Amyclas:

               But Ioue, spightful Ioue tooke opportunity offred,
               And by the secret sleights and wyles of false Cytheroea,
               
               In mothers absence her daughter alas he betrayed.
               Goe, qd he, my wanton, goe now whilst mother is absent,
               Bring her daughter abroad to the flowring fields of a purpose;
               
                  Atropos hath decreed, that supreame Duke of Auernus
               
               My brother Pluto, must haue Proserpina, fatall
               Orders must be obeyd: thy iurisdiction hereby
               Shalbe the more enlarg'd, and fame fly daily the further,

               Shee (for a word was enough) conueyd her away in a momēt,
               And (for so Ioue would) Pallas with stately Diana
               
               Ioynd as companions: all which three lastly aryued
               
                  There, where Lady Ceres her daughters bowre had apoynted.
               Wyly Venus drawes on simple Proserpina foorthwith,
               Vnto the greene medows: herself went first as a leader,
               Next came fayre Phoebe, and Ioue-borne Pallas Athene,
               
               And shee between them both, who both thē rightly resembled,
               Sweete yet sweetly seuere Proserpina: eu'n very Phoebe,
               
               If that a bow were giu'n, if a target, Pallas Athene.
               
               And sweete water-Nymphs by the careful mother apoynted,
               Their mayden Princesse with a princelike company guarded:
               Chiefly of all others, Cyane there made her aparance,
               Whom for her excelling conceipt, and seemly behauiour,
               Chiefely of all other well-Nymphs Proserpina loued.
               There was a Christal brook by the fields, that ioyned on Aetna.
               
               Called Pergusa, transparent down to the bottome;
               Trembling leaues as a veyle, gaue cooling shade to the water,
               Trembling leaues of trees, that crownd this lake as a garland;
               Euery tree displayd his flowring boughs to the heauen,
               Euery bow had a bird which therein made her abyding,
               Euery bird on bow tooke ioy to be cherefuly chirping,
               Euery chirp was a song, perswading all to be louing.
               Fresh-colored medowes were ouer-spread with a mantle
               Figured, and Diapred with such and so many thousand
               Natures surpassing conceipts, that maruelus Iris
               
               Was no maruel at al, and spotted traine, but a trifle,
               Prowd-hart Peacocks spotted traine, compar'd to the matchles
               Art, which nature shewd, in shewing so-many strange shewes.
               Hither these Ladyes are come, and euery Lady
               Plucketh at euery flowre; seeing each flowre to be more fayre,
               More fresh, more radiant, more louely, then euery Lady.
               In meane time Pluto wounded by wyly Cupido,
               
               Intends his iourney to Sicilia; Griesly Megoera,
               
               And fell Alecto his foaming steedes be preparing,
               Steedes, that drank on Lethes Lake, and fed by the ioyles
               Bancks of Cocytus. Nycteus and sulphurus Aethon
               
               Swift, as a shaft; fierce Orphnaeus with fearful Alastor,

               And seeking passage, with strange and horrible earthquakes
               Ouer-turnd whole townes, and turrets stately defaced.
               Euery Nymph heard, felt, and fear'd this deadly resounding,
               And dreadful quaking, but of all this deadly resounding
               And dreadful quaking, not a nymph there knew the beginning,
               Sauing onely Venus; whose heart with terror amazed,

               Duke of Ghosts, missing of a way, through so-many by-waies,
               And all impatient with loues rage, brake with his Iron
               Mace, the

                  ebelling rocks, and piearst through th'earth to the heauens,

               Starres sled back for feare, Oríons hart was apaled,
               
                  Charles-Wayne ran to the sea, that he euermore had abhorred,

               Baleful breath of night-borne coursers darkned Olympus
               
               Chereful light, and loathed foame distild fro the bleeding
               Bits, infected th'ayre: and th'earth all torne by the trampling,
               Shakte and quakte for dread, and yeelded a heauy resounding.
               Ladies al ran away; Proserpina lastly remayned,
               Whom Stygian coachman both sought &amp; caught in a moment.
               
                  Pluto droue on apace, Proserpina woefuly wayling,
               Cald and cryed, alas, to the Nymphs, to the maids, to the Ladies;
               But Nymphs, Mayds, Ladies were all affrayd to be present,
               And her mothers chance, ill chance, was then to be absent.
               Now Stygian raptor those prayers lightly regarding
               In respect of a pray and prise so worthy the taking,
               Chears and calls his dreadful steedes, and shaketh his out-worne

               Lady Ceres all this meane time possest with a thousand
               Careful mothers thoughts, thought euery houre to be twenty,
               Till she returnd homeward: and home at last she returned,
               At last, but too late, to her house, but not to her houshold:
               Court was a wildernes, forelorne walkes, no-body walking,
               Gates turnd vpside downe, hall desolat, euery corner,
               Euery way left waste. But alas when lastly she entred
               
                  Persephone's chamber, seeing her curius hand-work,
               And embroydred clothes, all ouer-growne by the copwebs,
               But no Persephone; such inward anguish amased
               Her distressed sprites, that neither a word fro the speechles
               Mothers mouth could once come forth, nor a teare fro the sightles
               Eyes; eyes, mouth, sence, soule, were nothing els but a horror:
               Only she clipt, embrac't, and kist, and only reserued
               Her sweete daughters work, poore soule, insteed of a daughter,
               After long wandring, by chance shee found in a corner
               Her deare daughters nurse, Electra, wofuly wayling,
               With rent roabes, scratcht face, and beaten brest, for her only
               Harts-ioy Persephone: whom shee as charily tendred,
               As dearest mother could euer tender a dearest
               Daughter: shee, when griefe and inward horror aforded
               Time to reueale it selfe, this woful storie recounted
               All at large: How Persephone was forc't to be walking
               Greatly against her mind, and mothers wil, to the meddowes,
               How foure black coursers conuey'd her away on a sudden,
               No-body knew whither, nor what man might be the autor:
               How her companions were all gone: only the louing
               And loued Cyane, for grief was lately resolued
               Into a siluer streame; and all those sweetly resounding
               
                  Syrens, made to be birds in part, in part to be maydens,
               And she alone was left, left all forelorne in a corner,
               
                  Mourning Persephone and her so heauy departure.
               Silly Ceres hearing these dead newes, all in a furie
               Rayled on heau'n and earth, and ran to the sulphurus Aetna,
               
               Lighted two Pine-trees, and day and night by the deserts,
               Hils, dales, woods, waters, lands, seas, Proserpina searched,
               Searcht from th'East to the Weast: at last, al weary with endles
               Toyling and moyling, halfe dead for drink, she repayred
               Vnto a poore thatcht coat, and knockt, and meekly desired,
               That to a schorched mouth some water might be aforded.
               Th'ould Beldam coat-wife brought forth a domesticalHotchpot,
               Her chiefe food, both meat and drink, and gaue to the Goddes.
               Faintly Ceres feeding by the coat, was spy'd of a sawcie
               Crackrope boy, who mockt, and cald her a greedy deuouring
               Out-come witch in scorne: Whereat this Lady agreeued,
               And not forgetting Latonaes worthy reuengement
               On Lician Lobcocks, (who sith they rudely denied
               Water, were made frogs alwayes condemn'd to the water)
               Threw in this boyes face all that was left of her Hotchpot.
               Mocking gallowes thus by the Goddes strangely besprinckled,
               Was transformd to a Swyft; whose back grew al to be speckled,
               And his spiteful breast with wonted poyson abounded.
               Through what lands and seas this Goddes wofuly wandred,
               Twere too long to report: each part of th'earth she perused,
               Vainly perused alas: and home at last she returned
               Back to Sicil; cursing, banning, and daylie reuiling
               Euery soyle, but chiefly Sicil: Which now the detested
               More, then afore the desir'd: brake plowes, kild wearied oxen,
               Blasted corne, bred weedes and tares, sent forth the deuouring
               Foules, and too much drought, &amp; too much raine from Olympus.
               
               Fields for corne and graine of late so greatly renowned,
               Are to a barren waste, and wilde heath speedily changed.
               Whilst childeles mother thus rageth, faire Arethusa
               
               (Who by the secret caues of th'earth from Pisa to Aetna
               
               Fetcheth a restles race) vp-lifted her head to the heauens,
               And these first tidings to the forelorne Lady reported,
               How herselfe of late taking her way by thefearfull,
               Imperiured Styx, saw her lost childe in Auernus,
               
               Somwhat sad, yet a Prince and supreame Queene in Auernus;
               Queene to the mighty Monarch &amp; sou'raigne king of Auernus.
               
               Mournfull mother amas'd, for a while stoode like to a senceles
               Stocke or stone: at length, when fury remoued amasement,
               Vp to the heau'ns she flies, &amp; makes her moane to the thundrer.
               
                  Lord and loue, qd shee, vouchsafe at last to remember,
               Take some care in time of poore Proserpina, think her
               If not mine, yet thine, and if thine, not to be stollen:
               But let passe what's past, let rape and rage be remitted,
               So that thy daughter from his hellish dens be deliu'red.
               T'were no disparaging, qd 
                  Ioue, if prince of a mighty
               Empire, Ioues brother might haue Proserpina, ioyned

               Should haue no cause then to repine at lightsom Olympus.
               
               Yet notwithstanding, if thou stand fully resolued,
               And that my brother Pluto must needs be refused;
               Then let Persephone both mine and thine be reduced,
               If she be fasting yet: for so hath Atropos ordred,
               And fatall orders are neuermore to be altred.

                  ficacie and vertue of the earth (sayth Cicero, 2. de natura deorum) draweth vnto it the rootes of corne, growing &amp; increasing in the bowels of the earth. Ceres her mother seeketh Proserpina, and mourneth for her absence: the corne pursueth and foloweth the se

                  de: or, The earth seemeth to greeue, when the corne springeth not vp in due time. Proserpina was rauished in Cicil, the dearest soyle to Ceres: that was a most fruitful and fertile Island. Arethusa (signifying the natural power and vertue of the seede and roote) is the first that tolde Ceres tydings of Proserpina: In continuance and conueniencie of time, by that naturall efficacie and operation of the roote and seede, the grayne and corne itselfe appeareth &amp; springeth vp. Six moneths soe lies with her husbādial the winter time, whilest the sunne doth soiourne in the southerne signes: six aboue with her mother, when the sunne returneth to the northerne signes, bringing corne to ripenes and maturitie. She had this name Proserpina, of the latine word, Proserpo, which is to creepe forwards, because the rootes creepe along in the body of the earth. She was gathering flowers when Pluto tooke her away, and kept her below; for then is that naturall vertue of the seede working, to produce afterwards the fruit and flowre accordingly. Pluto was accompted the Lord of riches and treasure: Pluto is the earth, whence al mettals are digged.

Some make him blinde, because he dealeth partially in distributing riches, not according to desert. And they giue him a key in his hand, sith his hellish gates are so surely locked, that the Ghostes once entring, can neuer possibly returne. He is called the God of Ghosts, as some thinke, because he first instituted the funerall obsequies and solemnities vsed at mens burials. He sitteth as a prince on a throne, with a crowne on his head, a scepter in his hand, and Cerberus, his dogge, at his feete. Cupressus is sacred vnto him, for it is vsed in funerals, and being once cutte, neuer buddeth or brancheth afterward.

                  Proserpina being in hell, did eate: and, as some others report the tale, did eate poppie seedes; whose nature is to cause drowsines, sleepe, staying and resting. So Proserpina must stay below, till she haue gotten roote and bee well and sufficiently grounded. Her mother Ceres refused Mars and Apollo: for, wars, and ouer much heate of the sunne, are both bad for corne and plenty. Ceres, by reporte, first found and taught the vse of corne and grayne, and thereby brought men from that wilde and sauage wandering in woods and eating of Ackornes, to a ciuil conuersing, and more orderly dyet, and caused them to inhabite townes, to liue sociably, to obserue certain la

daughter. For in summer, when the beames of the sunne are hoate and burning. the countreymen seeke and gather the corne, then full ripe and ready for the sickle. Her chariot was drawne by two serpents or flying dragons: serpents are so called a serpendo, of creeping and crawling in and out, as the rootes of corne doe: or, for that the turning and winding bodies of dragons, resemble the crooked furrowes of the earth. Ceres, the earth, great by Ioue, the temperat heate of the ayre, brought forth Proserpina, corne and graine: A sow was sacrificed to Ceres, for she rooteth &amp; spoyleth the corne: so was the goate to Bacchus, for gnawing the vines: or, the sow is fruitefull, so is the earth; the sow euer walloweth in the myre and earth, and Ceres herselfe noteth the earth.

               Besides Ceres, there were other goddesses, that had care of the fruite of the earth, as, Pales, that lookt to the Pastures, and was the Pastors goddes; Pomona, the Lady of Apples, hauing her name of the latine Pomum, which signifieth an apple. Flora, the goddes of flowres, and wife to Zephyrus: Bona dea, the good goddes, (otherwise called Fauna, à fauendo, of cherishing and fauouring) noting that quickning efficacy of the earth, which norisheth and fostreth the seede cast into the same. Flora, they say, in truth was a Romaine strumpet, called Laurentia; who dying, left her wealth, which was excessiue, to the people of Rome, who for her honor, made her a goddes of flowres, and called her Flora, of the word Flos signifying, a flowre.
               
                  Iupiter, by report of Plato, perceauing that the auncient edict, commaunding euery man to be rewarded according to his desert, was not obserued because men being aliue were iudged by liuing iudges: did enact, that none from thenceforth should receaue triall, but after death: when all externall shewes of birth, bewty, strength, riches, nobilitie and such like, were altogether remoued. And that only his three sonnes, Aeacus, Minos, and Rhadamanthus (whereof the two last were borne in Asia, the first in Europe) should after their death, repaire to a meadow, called The field of truth (where were two waies, the one leading to the Elysian fields, the other to the place of torment) and there sit in iudgement of the spirites and ghosts of all, that had left their earthly mansion and habitation. Rhadamanthus was apointed to giue sentence of such as came from Asia; Aeacus iudged those of Europe: and Minos, if any doubt or ambiguitie arose, was the discusser and determiner thereof.

                  Cerberus is Plutoes dog, with three heades, watching that none goe out, but ready to let all in; fawning on these, deuouring those, according to his name. For 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                  : wherefore some vnderstand by him, the all-deuowring earth, eating and consuming all earthly bodies. Others, by Cerberus, intend mans bodie, prest and appliable to all sensuall lust, but repugning and abhoring vertue and contemplation. His three heads be taken of some to represent those three necessarie euills, which withdraw men from contemplation, I meane, hunger, thirst, and sleepe: to all which, we must offer a morsell, as Sybilla taught Aeneas in Virgil, we must yeeld, but not too much; so much only, as thereby nature may be susteined. Natalis Comes expoundeth it thus: Cerberus is Couetousnes: and a couetous man laughes when hee sees gold come in; but it greeues his heart to lay out one penie. His three heads note the manifold guiles and deceites of couetous men, Qui omnes pecuniae vias norunt, know all the waies in the world how to scrape coyne. Cerberus lyes in an hellish dungeon: a myser lurketh in corners, turnìng his rustie groates, without either profit to others, or pleasure to himselfe. Hercules drew him out of Hell, for, who can be a Hercules, and accomplish great matters, without money? Or thus, Hercules bound and brought out Cerberus, that is to say, he bridled and kept vnder concupiscence, and therefore returned safe from Hell: but Pyrithous going thither of purpose to rauish Plutoes Queene, and so to satisfie sensualitie, was deuoured of Cerberus: or, lastly, Hercules is a learned and absolute Philosopher: hee draweth the three-throated Cerberus out of Hell, by bringing to light the tripertite mysteries of Philosophie, naturall, morall, and dialecticall. Cerberus, for spite and rage, strugling with Hercules, did let his poysoned foame fall on the earth, whence proceeded the deadly Aconitum, for, what but rancor, can come frō a rancorous heart? Historically, as Pausanias reporteth, there was in a darke dungeō in Taenarus, leading to Hell, as the fame went, for the deepenes thereof, an hydeous and terrible serpent, which for his deadly poyson, and fearefull aspect, was called the Diuels dog, and was by Hercules drawne forth, and brought to King Euriftheus.

Some say, they vsed to sweare by water; because as water is the most ancient ground and beginning of things, so an oath should bee most strictly obserued and religiously honored, as a thing no lesse reuerenced, then water, the foundation of all: whatsoeuer was the cause, the matter is aparant by Homer and Virgil euery where, that they sweare by Styx▪ which therefore was called the imperiured riuer.

               Much like in nature to these furies, were the Harpyes, faced like Virgins▪ winged like birdes, with pale and hungry visages, and crooked scraping clawes, deciphring flatterers, or rather, couetous and snatching worldlings. Harpyae, (saith Natalis Comes, expounding it physically) haue this name of 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : noting the furious violence, and rage of the windes: the first was called Ocypete, swiftly flying: the second, Aello, that is a storme or tempest: the third Celaeno, the darkenes of the clowds driuen with windes. They were the daughters of Thaumas and Electra, by reason of the strange and wonderfull nature and might of the windes, which are eleuated and lifted vp by the beames of the sunne from the purer &amp; vpper-flowing water of the sea. Virgil describeth them, 3. aeneid. as the most detestable monsters, that euer issued out of the Stygian lak. Hither may be added those Haggs▪ called Lamiae, who with their sweete and maidenlike face, brest, and body, allure men vnto them, but with their serpentine clawes destroy them afterwards.

                  Chimera's vpper part was like a Lyon, the middle like a Goate, the lowest like a Serpent, slaine by Bellerophon. Historically, it was a mountaine in Lycia, breathing out fire, whose top Lyons did haunt, in the middle were pastures, where Goates fed, and the foote was frequented by Snakes and Serpents. Bellerophon made it habitable, and was therefore saide to haue killed Chimera. Chimera, the type of inordinate luste, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   first inuadeth men fiercely like a Lyon, then want only and lasciuiously like a Goate, afterwards brings poysoned sorrow and repentance figured by snakes and serpents. Bellerophon sollicited to folly by Antia, wife to Praetus King of the Arigiui, constantly refused

whereupon she falsly accused him to her husband, of violence offered. Bellerophon by these meanes banished, passing through diuers dangers and perills, riding on the winged horse Pegasus, and bearing his terrible Gorgon, at last slew Chimera. He was called Bellerophon, either of one Bellerus, a Corinthian Prince, whom he vanquisht; or, of 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , for that hee rooted out euills and mischiefes: or else, you may so tearme him, as 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , a wise and prudent counsailer, or 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , as Homer speaketh. Palaephatus reporteth, that Pegasus was the ship that brought Bellerophon. Allegorically, by Pegasus borne of the blood of Medusa, we may vnderstand immortalitie and euerlasting fame. For, vertue ouer-comming all terrible things, figured by Gorgon, breedeth fame: and fame is eternised by the sounding voyce of Poets: which was the cause that the learned well, was said to be opened by the hoofe of Pegasus, striking the Parnassian mount. Medusaes hayre (either for that Neptune in Mineruaes temple vsed her irreligiously, as Ou
                        •
                     d reporteth the tale 4. Metam. or, for that she gloried so much in her golden locks, as that she durst compare with goddesses) were turned into snakes, and the beholders thereof into stones. Medusa herselfe noteth lustfull beawty and voluptuousnes, turning men into stones; as making the greedy gazers thereon senceles and amased. None but Perseus, Ioues sonne, by Mineruaes help, ouercame her: celestiall grace and wisdome are the onely meanes, to represse this inordinate affection. Some, by the three Gorgons, note the three faculties of the soule in man: Medusa, of the three sisters, was only mortall, figuring the sensible and liuing power, common to beasts, beheaded by Perseus, that is, kept vnder by the good Genius or celestial grace. The second was Stheno, the reasonable facultie of the soule, the third Euryale, the light infused and intellectuall part. They turne the beholders into stones; for we must kill Medusa, all perturbations, and be in that respect, as dead as stones, else wee cannot enioy this intellectuall light. The borowed and common eye, which all they vse by course, is this infused light, deriued from one of them vnto another. Perseus beareth Gorgon; hee maketh men wonder at his excellent prowesse: Historically, Athenaeus reporteth, that in Lybia there was a kinde of beast like a calfe, killing with the very sight: one of them was brought dead to Marius, to Rome, his skinne being so diuersly colored that none there, could gesse what beast it was, and that Perseus, by likelihood, killed some of these, figured here by Medusa. Diodorus saith, that Gorgones were stout and warring women, the captaine whereof, Medusa, was slaine by Perseus. Others vnderstand the earth and earthly affections by Gorgon, dashed and daunted by Perseus borne of Ioue, that is▪ assisted by his heauenly helpe and influence. But I see, that Chimera, hath brought me too farre out of my way: Ixion therefore (to come back where I was before) is as I said already, plagued in hell, for his ambitious and aspyring arrogancie. The tale is notably well told by Kemy Belleau, 2. iòurnee, de la bergeric, beginning thus.
               
                  
                  Ie chante d'Ixion I'emprise audacieuse,
                  L'impudence, I'órgueil, &amp; I'idole venteuse
                  De la feinte Iunon, grosse de vent &amp; d'aer,
                  Ouurage industrieux des mains de Iupiter &amp;c.
               
               
                  Bartholomaeus Annulus in his picta poesi, hereby noteth a polluted conscience, which is euer his owne persecutor and tormentor, still flying, and yet still folowing himselfe, as Ixions wheele, that alwaies turns about, but neuer turns away. Sisiphus, being of Ioues counsaile, reuealed his secrets, and is therefore thus punished. Lucretius expoundeth it otherwise, of him that ambitiously gapeth after promotion, and is euer repulsed, toyling and moyling himselfe, with an endles rolling of a neuer-standing stone.
               
                  Sisiphus in vita quoque nobis ante oculos est,
                  Qui petere à populo fasces, saeuasque secures
                  Imbibit, &amp; semper victus tristisque recedit.
                  Nam, petere imperium, quod inane est, nec datur vnquam,
                  Atque in eo semper durum sufferre laborem:
                  Hoc est, aduerso nixantem trudere monte
                  Saxum, quod tamen à summo iam vertice rursum
                  Voluitur, &amp; plani raptim petit ae quora campi.
               
               Others expound it so, as meaning by the stone, the studies and endeuours of mortall men: by the hill, the whole course of mans life: by the hill top, the ioy and tranquillitie of the minde: by Hell, the earth, and men on earth: by Sisiphus, the soule and minde of man, which included in this prison of the body; striueth and contendeth by all meanes possible, to attaine to eternall rest, and perfect felicitie: which some repose in wealth, some in honor, some in pleasure: all which, hauing once gotten what they sought, begin againe as fast, to couet new matters, and neuer make an end of desiring: so that, he who first was wholly giuen to catch and snatch, being now growne to wealth, seeketh honor, and is as infinitely addicted to that vaine humor, as euer he was to the other miserable affection: this is the world, omnium rerum est vicissitudo: neither is it possible for any man (whilst he is a man) to enioy any setled felicitie in this life.
               
                  Tityus had his liuer, or, as some say, his heart, all day long deuoured by an Aegle; or, as others report it, by a vultur: and, as much as was consumed in the day, somuch was restored in the night; so that his torment was perpetuall. The liuer is the seate of lust and concupiscence, which in the night time suborneth vnchaste and wanton cogitations. Or physically thus, Tityus is the stalke or blade of corne, of 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , one letter being taken away: hee was horne of Iupiter and Elara, the daughter of Orchomenus, a riuer of Thessalia.
                  
This Elara, noteth the naturall humor and milke-white moisture in the seede of corne: and without Iupiter, that is heate, and Elara, moysture, the corne can neuer prosper. Iupiter therefore accompanying with Elara, when she had conceaued, and was great, hid her in the ground, for feare of Iuno: she in the ground was deliuered of Tityus, who being borne by his mothers death, was brought vp and nursed of the earth. The sence hereof i
                     •
                   this, the seede is caste into the ground, for feare of the iniury of the ayre, noted by Iuno: the mother dyeth, for the seede putrifieth: Tityus springs forth, being nursed by the earth, and aspyreth vp towards heauen, as though he were about to offer violence to Latona, and is therefore throwne downe and slaine by the darts of Diana and Apollo: that is to say, hee is ripened, and brought to maturity, by the heate of the sunne, and moysture of the moone, that at length hee may be cut downe by reapers. Vulturs consume his liuer: for, the chaffe and huske is left to birds, as being not conuenient for bread to be made thereof. He is stretched forth in length, so as with his body he couereth nine acres of land: meaning that the corne thus sowed and springing vp, possesseth and ouerspreadeth a great quantitie of grounde.
               
                  Tantalus, so named, as if a man would say, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , most vnfortunate and vnhappie, is the patterne of a miserable and couetous wretch, who aswell wanteth that which he hath, as that which he hath not: so Horace expoundeth it: But Ouid saith, he was thus tormented in Hell; to haue apples and waters alwaies before him, yet alwaies running from him, when he was about to reach them, because of his blabbing tongue,

                     Quaerit aquas in aquis, &amp; poma fugacia captat
                     Tantalus: hoc illi garrula lingua dedit.
                  
               
               
                  Tantalus was Iupiters son, a man fully instructed with naturall and celestiall Philosophie, and is therefore saide to haue eaten with the Gods, and to haue feasted and enterteigned them with a banquet; sith his whole delite was meditation and heauenly contemplation. In this banquet (to try whether the Gods knew all secrets) he killed and cut in peeces his sonne Pelops, and set him before them among other dishes: Ceres then present among the rest, did taste and eate the showlder of Pelops. Philosophers and learned men, whilst they wholly addict themselues to contemplation, neglecting their worldly and domesticall affaires, loose sometimes their goods, sometimes their children, or wife, or otherwise. Ouid telleth the tale in 6. Meta. adding further, that the Gods then pitying Pelops, vnited his torne members, and insteede of the shoulder deuoured by Ceres, made one vp of Iuory plaguing his father in Hell, for his offence. Some others make a stone hang ouer his head, still like to fall and breake him to powder; to note out the continual labor and vexation of spirit, incident to euery man, that is seriously bent to earnest meditation. He is saide

to haue imparted vnto men, Nectar and Ambrosia, the drinke and meate of the gods: because he did communicate among them, those hidden treasures of heauenly philosophie: for 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   is immortall, and Nectar hath in effect the same signification, noting, that the gods are immortall, and cannot dye, according to the verse,
Iupiter Ambrosia satur est, &amp; nectare viuit.
               
               
                  Belides, or Danaides, were the fiftie daughters of Danaus, who killed their husbands all in one night, sauing only one; and are therefore enioyned to fill broken tubs with water still running out. Lucretius hereby vnderstandeth our vnthankfull mindes and vnsatiable desires, who still hauing, desire still to haue: so that nature powreth her infinite blessings into vs, as into broken vessels, which are euer empty and ready for more. It may signifie the whole estate of mans life, neuer setled, neuer satisfied, euer dooing and vndooing, and dooing almost all, to no purpose at al. It may also note the exchecquer or treasury of a prince, which like the sea, still receaueth, and is neuer full: or lastly, the nature of a blab, that is like a broken tub, plenus rimarum, full of slifies, flowing out here and there, keeping nothing secret, that is imparted vnto him. With these and such like monsters, and monstrous torments, the poets haue furnished their hell. Virgil 6. aeneid, setteth downe all most plentifully, placing at the very entrance and gate of hell, a rable of hellish haggs, as woe, reuenge, wrath, sicknes, old age, feare, famine, penurie, death, labor, sleepe, warre, discord, and such others. The torments aboue rehearsed, are apointed for the wicked and damned ghosts: the good and blessed spirits enioy euerlasting happines in the Elysian fields, a place seuered from the comfortles lodge of the damned.
               The Sirenes (which I had almost forgotten) sought for, and folowed after Proserpina: strumpets and wanton huswiues folow riches &amp; aboundance, figured by Proserpina, the Lady of fruite and corne, according to that olde saying, Sine Cerere &amp; Baccho friget Venus.
               
               The mocking boy made a Swift, Ascalaphus (borne of Orphne and Acheron) turnd to an Owle, the loutes of Lycia transformed to Frogs, and Lyncus, changed to a Lynx, are all tokens of iust plagues inflicted on such offendors.
               
                  Triptolemus, historically, in a ship bearing the name of the Dragon, brought store of corne to Athens, being in his time miserably plagued with famine.
               These discourses thus ended, the Nymphs were suffered to rest for a time, and the Pastors enioyned freshly to pursue their interrupted narrations. Among whome Alphesibaeus told this tale of his master Phoebus.

               Gyrle; or shoote at crowes, if boyes will needes be a shooting,
               Such warlike weapons are far more meet for Apollo,
               
               Who with a thousand shafts of late, confounded an ougly
               Snake, whose poysned panch all ouerwhelmed a countrey.
               Well, qd winged boy, content: let mighty Apollo
               
               Shoote at snakes: and Lord of Loue at mighty Apollo:
               
               And as much as a snake is lesse then mighty Apollo,
               
               Soe much, Lord of Loue is more then mighty Apollo.
               
               This sayd, yeelding ayre with fluttring wings he deuideth,
               And Parnassus mount in a moment nymbly recou'reth:
               There two feath'red shafts from painted quiuer he plucketh,
               Of strong, yet diuers operation: one with a golden
               Sharp head, breeding loue: and th'other fram'd with a leaden
               Blunt head, feeding hate: Loue-breeder woundeth Apollo,
               
               Hate-feeder Daphne: and eu'n as much as Apollo
               
               Lou's Daphne, so much this Daphne hateth Apollo.
               
               
                  Daphne goes to the woods and vowes herself to Diana;
               
                  Phoebus growes starke wood, for loue and fancie to Daphne.
               
               When that he looks on her haire, fayre haire and sweetly beseeming,
               Though vndrest, vntrest, blowne here and there by the shoulders:
               Then doth he think: ô if these loose, yet sweetly beseeming
               Locks, were drest, and trest, and not left loose by the shoulders,
               How-much more would they seeme fayre and sweetly beseeming?
               When that he lookes on her eies, like sparkling stars in a frostie
               Night: and lips, (yet lips to be kissed, not to be lookt on)
               And armes all naked, fro the milk-white wrist to the elbow:
               Then doth he think: If I ioy these outward partes to be viewing,
               O, what a heau'n were it, those secret partes to be tutching?
               O, what auailes it now, with scorneful words to be bragging,
               And with winged boy, nay wicked boy, to be striuing?
               O, what auails it now to be Titan, Phoebus, Apollo,
               
               Bright, burning, radiant, with sight, light, beauty abounding?
               Thou, whose beames did burne heu'n, earth, and watery Empire,
               Art now scorcht, nay burnt, yea burnt to the bones with a wilde-fire:
               Thou, who shouldst by right, be the due and daily beholder
               Of both land and sea, doost now looke only on one thing,
               Only vpon Daphne: fixing those eyes on a Virgin,
               Which thou owst to the world: and gerst vp rath in a morning,
               For to behold her face: and goest downe late in an eu'ning,
               Sory to leaue her sight: sometimes thy beames be eclipsed,
               
                  Thy face discolored, thy countnance chearful, apaled,
               And makst mortal men with a soddayne terror amazed,
               And all this for loue: for, loue makes strong to be weakned,
               Loue all-seeing sunne, on a soddayne makes to be darkned:
               Simple Daphne feares, and flies, for feare, from Apollo:
               
               Louer Apollo runs, and thus complains as he runneth.
               O, stay deare Daphne, thy best friend hasteneth after,
               Fly not away, sweet soule; for so sheep run fro the Woolu's-iawes,

               Euery one from a foe: but Daphne flies from a faithful
               Friend, from a wounded soule, from a constant louer Apollo.

               O, stay, haste makes waste, these thorns may chāce to be pricking
               Those thy tender legs, and all through fault of Apollo:
               
               O, these waies are rough, and ouer-growne with a thousand
               Briers, if Daphne needs will goe, let her easily goe on,
               Easily goe on afore, and Ile haste easily after.
               And yet let Daphne not scorne to regard, to remember,
               And mark wel, what he is, that beares such fancie to Daphne.
               
               Noe brute mountaine bird, no swayne, no rustical Hoblob,
               No threed-bare pastor, with an hyred flock by the forrest,
               Prowd of a bawling curre, of a iarring pipe, or a sheep-hooke,
               But burning Tytan, bright Phoebus, chearful Apollo.
               
               
                  Delos mine Honnor, my fame and glory denounceth,
               And Clarian temples doe yeeld mee duetiful offrings.
               Simple wench, God knowes, thou knowst not Phoebus Apollo,
               
               And therfore thou runst as a simple wench, from Apollo,
               
               Worlds sight, and worlds light, worlds comfort, Phoebus Apollo,
               
               Soothsayer, singer, Ioues ofspring, Phoebus Apollo,
               
               Yea, and most stedfast, most cunning archer, Apollo,
               
               Had not that vile boy more stedfast hand then Apollo.
               
               Healing hearbs, strange rootes, sweet balmes, odoriferus oyntments
               Were found out, set forth, first taught by Phoebus Apollo,
               
               And yet alas, not an hearb, not a roote, not a balme, not an oyntment
               Is to be found that can cure cureles wound of Apollo.
               
               
                  Phoebus spake; and more by Phoebus was to be spoken,
               
                  Daphne breakes his speech, and runs for life fro the speaker.
               Sweet windes encountring Daphne (as loth to be leauing
               So braue lasse, and glad such tender lims to be tutching)
               With milde blasts did blow her garments easily backward,
               That bare skin, more white then snowe vntroaden, apeared,
               And wauing loose locks flew here and there by the shoulders.
               
                  Flight augments her forme, and barest parts be the brauest:
               Flight augments his loue, and nearest ioyes be the dearest:
               And as a nimble youth, as a youthful God, to the damsel
               Strayght with might and mayne, and all inraged he flieth,
               And leaues intreating and frames himself to a forcing.
               Like as a light-foot hound, and trembling hare, in an open
               Field, when as either runs, and either feares to be out-run,
               Either runs for life, and either runs for a hares life,
               Hare to prolong her life, and murdring hound to abridge it:
               Hound thrusts forth his snowt, girds out, and greedily snatcheth:
               Prest to deuour poore hare; poore hare scarce fully resolued
               Whether shee's yet caught or not caught, shrinkes fro the murdrers
               Teeth all on water: so Daphne, so was Apollo.
               
               Feare driues on Daphne, and loue stil lifts vp Apollo:
               
               Loue so lifts louer, that neare and nearer he vrgeth
               Poore fainting Daphne, now hard at her heeles he aprocheth▪
               
               Eu'n so hard at her heeles, that Daphnes hayre by Apollo,
               
               
                  Daphnes scattered hayre was blow'n by the breath of Apollo.
               
               Then weake and all spent, turning her face to the waters,
               
                  Poenaeus waters, there this last boone she desireth.
               Father Poenaeus, lend helping hand to thy daughter,
               If you brookes are Gods, and haue such grace from Olympus,
               
               Let this gaping earth conuey mee downe to Auernus,
               
               Or, let this my face, too pleasing face, be defaced,
               Let this forme, which causd my former woe, be deformed,
               And to an other shape by transformation altred.
               Her words scarce vttred, lims al were starck in a moment,
               And her tender breast, all ouer-grow'n with a tender
               Barck, and locks were leaues, &amp; bare armes grew to be branches:
               Swift foot was slow root, and crowne transformd to a tree-top;
               In stead of Daphne by the riuer sprang vp a Laurel,
               Laurel fresh and fayre, as fayre and fresh as a Daphne.
               
               
                  Phoebus comes sweating and blowing vnto the new tree,
               And, for his old loues sake, beares endles loue to the new tree:
               Yet when he tutcht new tree, new tree was afrayd of a tutching;
               Vnder a bark of a tree, Daphne was felt to be panting;
               Yea, when he offred a kisse to the tree, in stead of a Daphne,
               
               Tree bent back fro the kisse, and started aside as a Daphne.
               
               Well, qd he, though Daphne shall neuermore be Apolloes
               
               Wife, yet Daphnes tree shall euermore be Apolloes
               
               Tree, and deck both head, and hayre, and bow of Apollo.
               
               Yea, those noble Dukes, great Lords, and martial Emprors.
               
                  
                  Daphnes Laurel leaues at feasts and stately triumphings,
               In signe of conquest, shall euermore be adorning:
               And as Apolloes face is fresh and lyuely for euer,
               So shall Daphnes leaues grow greene and louely for euer,
               Thus did Apollo speak, and Laurell tree for a Daphne,
               
               Bowes her top for a head, and condiscends to Apollo.
               
               
                  Daphne thus transformd: Clymene was lou'd of Apollo,
               
               Lou'd, and bare him a son; Phaeton; too youthful a yonker,
               Whose ouer-weening was his ouerthrow, by presuming
               Rashly beyond his reach, his fathers coach to be guiding:
               Like to the foolish boy, who mounting vp to Olympus,
               
               Burnt his wings and wax, and soe fell downe to Auernus.
               
            
            
               YOu are a good scholler of the best master, sayd Elpinus to Alphesibaeus: And your masters mother, as I haue heard say, was Thia, that is, Diuine: &amp; his father, Hyperion, going ouer vs, or aboue vs, as the sunne doth. Some others make his mother to be Euriphaessa, late Splendens, glistering far and neere: but the vsuall, and most receaued opinion is, that Iupiter begat both Sunne and Moone of Latona: who being great, could finde no resting place, by reason of Iunoes wrath: vntill at last she came to the wandring Delos, where she was deliuered of them both. The reason alleadged by some, is this; after that cōfused &amp; vndistinct Chaos wherof alwas made, called Latona, 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , (as Plato would haue it) à Latendo, of lurking, and lying hid, and unknowen: Light (which chiefly proceeds from Sunne and Moone) was first framed by that all-framing creator. They are sayd to be borne in Delos (an eminent and high Island) because presently after the creation of light, things began to come to light, to be seene, to be knowen, which first lay confused and not perceaued, in the darkesome bottome of that all-including Chaos. Hereof came the name Delos, of

                  Apollo hath long yealow hayre: noting his rayes and beames, which heate and hit, like dartes, a far off; and therefore is he called of Homer

                  . He is young, fresh, and without any beard: for, his force neuer fadeth, and his heate is alwayes quickning. Therefore, the Tyran Dionisius did cut off Aesculapius his golden beard, saying, It was no reason, that the sonne should haue such a long beard, when as his father Phoebus had none at all. This perpetuall youth, and neuer decaying nor declining validitie of Phoebus and other the Gods, is figured by Hebe: signifiyng the very flowre of youth, whom Homer for the same cause maketh Ioues cup-bearer. This Hebe was Iunoes daughter: for, of the temperature of the ayre proceede all hearbs and flowres: Iupiter is her father: for, without the quickning heat of the ethereal region, no temperature can be in the lower ayre: yet some there be that would haue her borne of Iuno without any father: Hebe on a time, as she bare the cup to Iupiter, slipt, and in

The Corinthians erected her a temple, in a certaine groue full of Cipresse trees: wherein such as escaped captiuitie &amp; thraldome, hanged vp their gyues and fetters in honor of Hebe.

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , light and life) is not onely young and fresh, but he is also the author of Physicke, the founder of musick, the gouernour of the Muses, and father of Oracles, all which excellencies proceede from the operation of the Sunne. His beames be pestiferous, if too hote, and therefore doth Homer make him plague the Grecian armie: but healthful, if moderate and temperate. Of this moderate heate of the Sunne, comes the temperature of the ayre: of a temperate ayre grow holesome hearbes and flowres, the simples and ingredients of euery physicall composition, and therefore Phoebus the author of physicke.
               
                  Phlegias is the heate of the Sunne; for, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , is to burne: his daughter was Coronis, the ayre moderately moystned and heated, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : of this Coronis and Phoebus, Aesculapius, the temperature of the ayre, is borne: whose daughters were two: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , soundnes of body of good health; and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , the efficacie of physicke in healing and curing mens bodies, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , which is, to cure. Aesculapius was slayne by angry Ioues thunder: Phoebus sory, and grieued for his sons death, slew in like sorte the Cyclopes, which made Ioues thunder: that is, the beames of the Sun, by degrees, doe consume that pestilent outrage of these contagious vapours and exhalations, causers of mortalitie. Aesculapius, being borne, was committed to Chiron, a most excellent Chirurgian, to be brought vp: Chiron was the sonne of Saturne, and the Nymph Philyra: for, knowledge and excellencie in physick, as in all other artes, is gotten by continuance of time and long experience: whereof Saturne representeth the one, and Philyra the other; so called of the greeke words

Now, he is also Musicall; and therefore Mercurie gaue him a Lute; whereon he playeth; alluding to the harmonie of the coelestiall Globes, and the constancie and vniformitie, which the Sun obserueth most strictly in his course, as euer keeping the Eclipticall line: for which cause he is the master of the nine Muses, ruling the concent and melody of the nine Sphaeres. The Muses are the daughters of Ioue (for all goodnes comes of Ioue) and of Mnemosyne, Memory. Their nurse was Eupheme, Honor and Fame: for, Honos alit artes, honor and commendation is a spur to a student. They were nine, proportionably to the number of the Sphaeres, whose gouerning spirites the Platonists and Pythagoreans would haue them to be.

Thalia to the Moone, florishing. These be the eight Muses, as it were, the tunes of those eight Sphaeres, whereof is made the perfect concent and melodious harmonie, figured by the ninth, called Calliope, a sweete concent, the chiefe and guide of all the Muses, as Ouid witnesseth, 5. Metam:
                  Dedimus summam certaminis vni,
meaning Calliope. and,
Finierat doctos è nobis maxima cantus:
to weete, Calliope. They are called Musae, of the verb 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , which is, to teach and instruct a man in those things, that are sacred and holy, diuine and mysticall, whereof came the word mysterie. They are also called Camenae, à canendo, of singing: and, Pierides, of the mount Pierius, where they were borne: They all, hand in hand, daunce in a round, and Phoebus in the middle: all liberall sciences are vnited and chayned together, the one depending on the other; noting that absolute 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   and cohaerent concatenation and continuation of all ingenuous erudition. Lastly, Phoebus is the father of Oracles and prophecies, the eye of the world, seeing and hearing all things first▪ as Homer was woont to say, and Ouid in imitation of Homer,

Therefore Laurell is his tree, both for that it is alwayes greene, and neuer toucht with lightning (noting that the fame of vertue and learning is euer flourishing, and neuer dyeth) as also hoate and odoriferous, and (as it is reported) causeth true dreames being applyed to a mans head and temples: and

being cast into the fire, portendeth good luck, if it make a great noyce or crackling: bad, if either none, or but a little. Coruus, the Crowe is his bird: whose different chirps and prognostications of rayne, were obserued of soothsayers and diuiners, whose maister is Apollo. Cicnus, the Swan, is also his bird: the Swan is white and bright as the sunne; a singer as Phoebus, a foreteller of his owne death, and so a diuiner as Apollo. Cicnus was king of Liguria; he loued Musick, and is therefore of Ouid turnd to a Swanne. Lastly, the cock is Apolloes bird, who dutifully saluteth him, and bids him good morrow euery morning. He is figured, a young fresh youth, hauing long hayre, no beard, a lute in the one hand, a bowe in the other, in a chariot drawen with foure coursers, Pyroeis, Eous, Aethon, Phlegon, Ignitus, Matutinus, Ardens, Comburens, being all Epithetes incident to the nature of the sunne: whose Pallace and Chariot are described by Ouid: 2. Metam: In Latine he is called Sol, quasi solus, alone and incomparable.

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , is Iuno, and

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , which signifieth to crye or roare, thereby noting the roaring and blustring tempests of winter, which are calmed, and repressed by Hercules, that is to say, by the heate of the Sunne. The Oxen be the crashes of thunder, whose feareful sound resembleth the lowing of Oxen: and these thundrings are neuer lightly heard, but when Hercules hath slayne Gerion; when winter is ouerpast by the heate of the Sun.

Oxen set foreward husbandry, and the vitall heate and influence of the Sunne, is the chiefe cause of increase: so then, Apollo may well be called a pastor, because, as Pontanus sayth, he feedeth and maintayneth all that liueth,
Quòd pascat quicquid sub coeli nascitur oris.
               
               The Assyrians (by report of Macrobius) especially honoured one God aboue others, whom they named Adad: which signifieth one: to whom they ioyned a Goddes, for a companion, called Atargatis: attributing all to these two: by whom they vnderstande the Sunne and the earth. The picture of Adad had his beames and rayes inclyning downewardes towarde Atargatis, shewing that the heauens worke on and in the earth, by influence from the sunne. Atargatis was so framed, as that her beames ascended vpwardes towardes Adad: notyng, that whatsoeuer the earth brought foorth, it came by operation of the coelestiall vertue. Vnder Atargatis was a

Lyon, signifying, that she was the great mother of all things, Earth: who, a

                   I shewed before when I spake of Cibele, had her chariot drawen by Lyons.
                     The picture of Adad, &amp; Atargatis.
                  
               
               
                  Aesculapius was borne by the death of his mother, as Ouid telleth the tale in the second of his transformations: where, after that he had shewed, how Apollo in his furie slew Coronis, great with Aesculapius, hee addeth thus,

                     Non tulit in cineres labi sua Phoebus eosdem
                     Semina: sed natum flammis, vtero
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         parentis
                     Eripuit, gemini
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         tulit Chironis in antrum. &amp;c.
                  
               
               The vertue medicinable is hereby figured, drawen from the roots of hearbs, when the earth is pierced with the arrowes, that is, parched by the hoate beams of the Sunne. This is deliuered to Chiron, the learned and experienced Physitian, who thereof frameth wonderfull compositions.
               
                  Aesculapius is made sitting on a high seate, with a crowne of Laurell on his head, a long beard, a knotted staffe in his right hand (it is a difficult and hard matter to restore decayed health) and a Snake in his left hand: a serpent is quick of sight, and watchfull; so must a Phisitian be. A Snake may well bee taken for a signe of health; sith, as shee by casting her olde skinne, renueth her selfe, so the sick and crased body restored to his former health, seemeth to be young agayne.

               The morning is the fore-runner to the sunne, yet caused of the sunne. She is called the daughter of Thia and Hyperion, she is ruddie like roses, she hath yellow hayre golden roabes, and sitteth on a golden throne. Aurora loued Tithonus, Laomedons sonne; because he fett his wyfe from the East; hee being extreamly olde, was turned to a Grashopper: olde men neuer cease tatling and chirping. The distinctions of times called howres, Horae, 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , which signifieth to keepe; doe guide, conserue and keepe in order all proceedings whatsoeuer, and are the daughters of Ioue and Themis, to weete, Eunomie, Dice, Eirene: for, no way better shall a man perceaue the good or bad dealing of men, and the merciful or reuenging power of the Gods, then by the change of times &amp; howrs: therefore they keepe heauen gates, and attend on the Sun, causing fayre or fowle weather, when they lust, for the profite or plague of mortall men.
                     The picture

               Now to Alphesiboeus his tale. Phoebus kild Pytho: the heat of the Sun consumed those pestilent vapors left after the deluge causing putrefaction, signified by this word, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , whereupon some think, he was called Apollo, of the verbe 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , to kill. Pontanus,
                  
                     Tum tellus grauis imbre &amp; adhuc stagnantibus vndis
                     Humida, anhela, vagos tollebat ad aethera tortus,
                     Inuoluens caelum nube, &amp; caligine opaca:
                     
                        Hinc ille immanis Python, &amp;c.
                  
               
               This made Phoebus vaunt: yet was he daunted by Cupid, and forced affectionately to loue Daphne, daughter to the riuer Penaeus: whereby is vnderstood, that naturall and radicall humor of the earth, proceeding from the waters and riuers, that moysten her and make her fruitefull. The sunne coueteth this moysture, sends downe his attractiue beames to draw it vp, resolues it into vapors, and makes it fit for himselfe. On the other side, this moysture flieth and withdraweth herselfe from the heate of the sunne, as from her deadly foe. Againe, the violent and piercing beames of the sunne, compell this moysture to forsake the vppermost and superficiall parts of the earth, retyring backward into the deepest and remotest parts thereof. Which, being thither come, and yet euen thither and there, persecuted by the scalding and searching rayes of Phoebus, is at last, by the meanes of the celestiall powers, and help of the watery floods and riuers, defended from the violence of Apollo, and conuerted into fruitefull trees and plants. Daphne is transformed into a laurell tree, rather then any other, for that, by reason of her excellencie, continuance florishing greenenesse, odoriferous sent, and naturall heate, shee aboue all other doth shew her constitution to be tempered with due and proportionable commixtion of terrene moysture and celestiall heat
                     •
                  . Daphne is Penaeus his daughter: for, by the bankes and meddowes adioyning thereunto, an infinite number of lawrell trees were growing. Apollo garnished his Lute and Quiuer with Lawrell leaues: so should only famous poets, worthy of Apollos Lute: and renowmed conquerors figured by his Quiuer, be crowned with Laurel, in token of their neuer-dying glory. Laurell is long kept; so is the fame of learned and valyant men: Laurell is alwaies greene: so is their praise eternall and euer-florishing: Laurell is hoate and odoriferous: so dooth the heauenly-inspired spirit of poets, and all-contemning courage of Heroicall mindes, breath foorth the sweete sauour of vertues excellency: Lastly, Laurell is neuer tutcht with lightning, and their names are neuer defaced by Obliuion.
               The other tale of youthfull Phaeton, and his father Phoebus, may first giue vs warning, neither to wish vnaduisedly, nor sodainely to yeeld to rash demaunds: nor vnconsiderately to performe a promise foolishly made. Phaeton, Semele, Theseus, and others, by their owne wishes procured their owne confusion. Phaeton was the sonne of Phoebus and Clymene: toweet the heat and inflammation procee
                     •
                  ing from the sunne. For 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , is, to burne: and Clymene, is the water, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , to ouerflowe: and when these ouerflowing vapors eleuated by the sunne, are once inflamed, then doth this outragious heate breake out. Phaeton fell downe into the riuer Eridanus, after extraordinary drought, folow commonly, inundations of waters.
               
                  Phaeton is beaten downe with thunder: for, these vapors raised vp by the sunne, and by the enuironing coldnes of the middle region of the ayre, thrust into a narrow straite; by strugling for passage, cause thunder and lightning,

til the outrage of that heate bee so consumed. Phaetons sisters, Phaetusa and Lampetie (noting heate and brightnes) did so sorowfully lament their brothers death, that, for pity, they were turned into poplar trees: that is, of this humor, and exceeding heate of the sunne, many kindes of trees and plants doe plentifully proceede. Lucian expoundeth it historically thus: Phaeton began seriously to obserue the course and reuolution of the sunne, but, preuented by death, could not finish his attempted enterprise. The ethicall moralization, (which Ouid himselfe tutcheth in his bookes de Tristibus) may be this: Phaeton, a youth, and therefore vnable to gouerne, will needes be a magistrate: but alas, it is too great a burden for his weake shoulders.
               
                  Magna petis, Phaeton, &amp; quae non viribus istis
                  Munera conueniunt, nec tam iuuenilibus annis.
               
               The gouernement and administration of a common wealth or kingdome, is a heauenly charge.
               Sors tua mortalis: non est mortale quod optas.
               It is also as heauy as heauenly. The beginning and climing vp, is hard and difficult: the top thereof subiect to a thousand perills and dangers, which make euen the most experienced, much to feare: and the discent or comming downe is headlong.
               
                  Ardua prima via est, &amp; quà vix manè recentes
                  Enituntur equi: medio est altissima caelo;
                  Vnde mare &amp; terras ipsi mihi saepe videre
                  Sit timor, &amp; pauida trepidet formidine pectus.
                  Vltima prona via est, &amp; eget moderamine certo.
               
               Besides this, in a common wealth, there be Bulls, Centaurs, Lyons, Scorpions, and such like; that is, sauage and rude people, vngentle, cruel, crafty, and enuious; to whose open violence and secreate supplanting the gouerner is euer subiect.
               
                  Forsitan &amp; lucos illic vrbesque deorum
                  Concipias animo, delubraque diti a donis
                  Esse: per insidias iter est, formasque ferarum,
                  Vtque viam teneas, nulloque errore traharis,
                  Per tainen aduersi gradieris cornua tauri,
                  Haemoniosque arcus, violentique ora Leonis
                  
                     Saeuaque circuitu curuantem brachia longo
                  Scorpion, at
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      aliter curuantem brachia cancrum.
               
               Againe, the rude rablement of the vulgar sort, will hardly be maistred, or brought to any conformitie.
               
                  Nec tibi quadrupedes animosos ignibusillis
                  Quos in pectore habent, quos ore &amp; naribus efflant,
                  In promptu regere est: vix me patiuntur, vbi acres
                  Incaluêre animi, ceruixque repugnat habenis.
               
               These and such other imminent mischiefes laid open by Apollo, he falleth at last to intreating and perswasions▪ and fearefull cares of a louing father.
               
                  Pignora certa petis: do pignora certa timendo,
                  Et patrio pater esse metu probor, aspice vultus
                  Ecce meos: vtinamque oculos in pectora posses
                  Inserere, &amp; patrias intus deprendere curas.
               
               But ambition can heare no reason, and Phaeton will needs sit in his fathers chariot.
               
                  dictis tamen ille repugnant▪
                  
                  Propositumque petit, flagratque cupidine currus.
               
               This chariot is the glorious type of earthly honor and dignitie: the axell tree all of golde, golden buck, golden follies of the wheeles, and siluer spokes: the collars, traces, and hownces glystred with Chrysolites, and other pretious stones, which rauish the minde of the yonker Phaeton.
               
               
                  Aureus axis erat, temo aureus, aurea summae
                  Curuatura rotae, radiorum argenteus ordo:
                  Per iuga Chrysolithi, positae
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      ex ordine gemmae
                  Clara repercusso reddebant lumina Phoebo.
               
               And againe,
Dumque ea magnanimus Phaeton miratur, &amp; optat. &amp;c.
               
               
                  Phoebus his horses note the vulgar people, as I said before, altogether fierce and outragious: the bridles are the stay of gouernement. Phaeton thus being obstinate, &amp; resolued to be a ruler, is now instructed how to rule. Spare the whip, reine them hard.
               Parce puer stimulis, &amp; fortius vtere loris.
               
                  The whip noteth a rigorous and tyrannicall kinde of commaunding and ouerruling: the reines, a moderate and temperate kinde of discipline. Mount not too high, fall not too lowe, keepe betweene both.
               
                  Altius egressus, caelestia tecta cremabis,
                  Inferius terras, medio tutissimus ibis.
               
               These praecepts ended, the yong headed officer, by the fauour and countenance of great men, is set aloft in his brauery.
               
                  Occupat ille leuem iuuenili corpore currum,
                  Statque super, manibusque datas contingere habenas
                  Gaudet, &amp;c.
               
               But when any tumult or sedition is stirred vp among the people, then is he nobody, and esteemed of nobody.
               
                  Sed leue pondus erat, nec quod cognoscere possent
                  Solis equi, solitaque iugum grauitate carebat.
                  Vtque labant curuae iusto sine pondere naues,
                  Perque mare instabiles nimia leuitate feruntur,
                  Sic onere insueto vacuos dat in acre saltus,
                  Succutiturque altè, similisque est currus inani.
               
               This happeneth to al such magistrats as will not rule according to Apolloes rule. The sunne indeede hath a contrarie motion to that of the heauen: but he trauerseth the heauen gently, not crosseth it ouerthwartly: and so must a ruler ouerrule the stubburne vulgar. Phaeton, poore youth, when all is on fire, all on an vproare, is at his wits end.
               
                  Tum verò Phaeton cunctis è partibus orbem
                  Aspicit accensum; nec tantos sustinet aestus.
               
               Then Iupiter, at the pitifull complaint of the earth, that is, the commonwealth, coms to helpe.
               
                  Intonat, &amp; dextra libratum fulmen ab aure
                  Mittit in aurigam. &amp;c.
               
               Where foloweth the miserable end of these lusty commaunders, brought to vtter confusion.
               
                  
                  Illîc fraena iacent, illîc temone reuulsus
                  Axis &amp;c.
               
               When all is come to al, Phaetons ambitious conceit, gaines naught but this to comfort his destruction, that when by his aspiring, he hath procured his owne ouerthrow, men may say after his death, This felow caried a braue minde, and shott at mighty matters.
               
                  Hic situs est Phaeton, currus auriga paterni,
                  Quem si non tenuit, magnis tamen excidit ausis.
               
               The like folly and fall was that of Icarus, who soared so high with his waxed wings, that he gaue name to the Icarian sea, wherein he was drowned. Ouid 8. Metam. sweetely telleth this tale, and in 3. de tristibus, as sweetely doth expound it.
               Sith Mercury and Apollo were reconciled and made good friends, it was apointed, that Damon should ioyne Mercury to his companion Phoebus: who did it briefly, thus.
            
            
               LOuely Coronis kild by the balefull darts of a louer,
               And tale-telling Crowe made black, for a worthy requital:
               Yong Aesculapius, by repenting hands of Apollo
               
               Cut fro the mothers wombe, was carefuly sent to the schoolehouse
               Of Centaure Chiron to be taught: who made him a cunning
               Surgeon; so cunning, that he dead men strangly reuiued.
               Whereat Ioue incenst, with thunder fram'de by the Cyclops,
               
               Stroake him dead himselfe, who cured somany deaths-wounds.
               
                  Titan, sad to behold his son so spitefuly murdered,
               On slaughtred Cyclops, his slaughter kindely reuenged.
               Thundring Ioue much wroth, that such as fram'de him a thunder
               Sould suffer violence, and not from death be protected,
               Expelled Phoebus, for a certaine time, from Olympus.
               
               
                  Phoebus in exile now, contents himselfe with a pastors
               Poore estate, and feedes Admetus flock, by the riuer
               
                  Amphrisus: so sweete and so secure is a pastors
               Harmeles life: life next to the matchles life in Olympus.
               
               Once in an eu'ning-tide, whilst Phoebus lay in a valley,
               And with rurall pipe bestowd him
                     •
                  elf on a loues-lay,
               His sheepe (sheepe indeede, that leant no eare to a loues-lay)
               Through Pylian pastures chaunst heere and there to be straying.
               
                  Mercury, Ioues prety Page, fine-filcher Mercury, saw them,
               
                  Caught and brought them away, and kept them close in a thicker.
               
                  Phoebus knew nothing▪ for no-bodie saw, but an ould churle,
               One ould canckred churle, which there kept Mares by the mountains,
               Called bald Battus: whome Mercury friendly saluted,

               Turnd his tale with a trice, and theaft to the theefe he reuealed.

               Tutch stone, yet true stone; which each thing truely bewraieth,

               At last, all brabling and altercation ended,
               
                  Mercury and Phoebus made friends, gaue one to another
               Mutual embracements, and tokens: Pastor Apollo
               
               Gaue his charmed staffe to the Nuntio Mercury: and the
               
                  Nuntio Mercury gaue his Lute to the Pastor Apollo.
               
               Thus they parted friends: to the flock went Pastor Apollo;
               
                  Mercury sored aloft, til he seas'd on bewtiful Herse,

               And cursed Couetise, and worthily turnde to a black-stone,
               Black-stone, signe of a minde all black and fowly defiled.
               Not long after this, Phoebus with Mercury; ioyned
               In faire-prowd Chione: Chione bare either a dearling:
               
                  Mercury, Autolicus did father, Apollo, Philammon;
               Th'one well knowne for a theese, and th'other fit for a fiddle;
               But faire-prowde Chione was kild at last by Diana.
               
            
            
               
                  ELpinus glad of so short a discourse, made as short worke in explication of the same. Mercury was Ioues messenger indeede, yet not vsed onely by

                  Ioue, but sometimes by other Gods also. His feete were winged, his hat winged, his face beardles, his body bare but that he had a cloake cast ouer his shoulders, he held in his hand a staffe called Caduceus, which Phoebus gaue him in exchange for his Lute: the serpents, winding it about, are a signe of concord; and the rod it selfe was borne of those who intreated of peace, called thereo

                  Caduceatores. His winged hat and feete shew, that speech and words (whereof Mercury is the best deliuerer) once being vttred, fly without returne, according to that of Horace,
                  Nescit vox missa reuerti.

               And Homer calleth words,

                  Mercury, according to his diuers aspects, worketh diuers influences in mens minds: if he be predominant, he afordeth eloquence, elegancy, learning, and especially mathematicall knowledge. If he looke on Ioue luckily, he giueth skill in Philosophical &amp; Theological speculations: if on Mars happily, he maketh good Physitians, if vnhappily, he maketh thē either bad Physitians, or starke theeues: whēce came the fable, that Mercury begate on Chione a notable theefe, called Autolicus, as musical Phoebus by the same mother had fidling Philammon. Mercury therefore is a plaine turnecoate good with good, bad with bad. Such as be Mercuriall, are commonly not very rich: yet they finde out now and then conceits and deuises to drawe money out of the chests of princes &amp; mighty men; sith their crafty and cunning master Mercury, hath made them fit for the managing of princes affaires. And this was the meaning of the tale, that maketh Mercury steale Apolloes cattell: for, Apollo noteth Kings &amp; potentates, and his flocks, are their wealth and riches, and the Mercuriall is the fitcher. If, by chance, his Legierdumaine be perceaued, he can so sinely smooth vp al by facility of discourse, that he neuer is vtterly disgraced by the mighty men. This their friendship and exchange noteth that incomparable vnion of Iouial intelligence with Mercuriall eloquence, the only flower of Kings courts, and felicity of common wealths. The periured Battus is as worthyly plagued for his double tongue, as the blabbing clawback, and Brewbate Crow▪ for his long tongue. Coronis kild by Apollo, noteth the withered hearbs, by the withdrawing of the moysture to the rootes; whereof already in Apollo. Only this we may remember, that Phoebus killing Coronis, is a type of wrathfull iealosie, cause of present repentance. This tale (as also that of Herse &amp; Aglauros) is in the second of Ouids transformations: and the other of Chione, (signifying, that pride will haue a fall) in the eleuenth.
               
                  Mercuries reconciliation with Phoebus being thus briefely expounded, it was thought good time, to talke of Mars, who, (as seemed by the late discourse) is also diuersly affected by or to the same Mercurie. Coridon

               WHil'st lymping Vulcan did lay on loade on his anuile,
               With sweating Steropes, and fram'de Gradiuus a breast-peece:
               
                  Gradiuus tooke paines; and sweete Cytheraea belabr'ing,
               With like endeauour made horned Vulcan a head-peece.
               
                  Phoebus saw them first (Phoebus see's euery thing first)
               Saw, and gree'ud very much, so shameful a sight to be seeing,
               Ran to the forge straightway, and there told al to the blacksmith,

               Downe falls hart, downe falleth his head, downe falleth his hammer,
               And no life, no soule, in senceles carkas apeareth.
               At last, fine small nettes, and chayne, of wire he deuised,
               So small and so fine, that sight must needes be deceaued;
               Much more fine and small, then finest threed of a copweb:
               And so craftily fram'd, and with such my sterie forged,
               That, with a pluck they claspt, with a tutch they speedily cloased,
               And held each thing fast, and each thing greedily grasped.
               These with sleight and art on adultrous couch he reposeth;
               And, in a secreate place expects polluted adultresse,
               And hoate raging Mars: who there lay louely together,
               Either on others breast, and either in armes of another.

               Poynt, when two were one, when moysture fully resolued
               Sought for a freer scope, when pleasure cam to a fulnes,

               And their fainting soules, in a sleep, in a swowne, in a loue-trance:
               Then was Mars fast tide, fast tide was dame Cytheraea,
               
               Then was Mars cooled, cooled was dame Cytheraea.
               
               
                  Mars the adulter lay entangled with Cytheraea,
               
               And Cytheraea lay entangled with the adulter:
               
                  Vulcans wires hold fast, they lye vnseemely together,
               Either on others breast, and either in armes of another.

               And calld Gods, to behold so strange and louely a wonder:

               No-body but Neptune could possibly pacifie Vulcan.

               And his broode with lust and rage shee dayly bewitched:
               
                  Sometimes Leucothoe with an endles loue he desireth,
               And sometimes Clytie, and sometimes louely Coronis.

                  nes, ioyned with Mars, which noteth hoate and furious rage, giuing themselues ouer to excessiue and inordinate pleasure; are by Phoebus, figuring the light of reason, accused to Vulcan, who representeth naturall heate; which is weakned by this inordinate lust. Vulcan, by Phoebus his counsaile, linketh them together to their shame: for, when naturall heate is quailed, then the rage of lust is abated, yrkesome repentance and languishing debilitie ensuing thereupon. Vulcan sheweth them both to be mockt of the Gods: the naturall heate complayneth, as it were, and sheweth to all the other faculties (called Gods by reason of their heauenly frame and function) his decay and impotencie: whence foloweth of necessitie the impayring of all the other faculties: especially he calleth foorth Neptune, Mercurie, and Apollo; sith Neptune by reason of moysture, noteth the nourishing power deriued from the Lyuer: Mercurie, the sensible part proceeding from the brayne: and Apollo the vital and quickning vertue comming from the heart; which three are extreamly preiudiced by immoderate lust. No man could pacifie Vulcan, sauing only Neptune: nothing can restore the decay of nature, but supply of moysture and nourishment. Venus
                  
incensed, persecutes with deadly hate, the whole family of Phoebus, for this discouery: for lust is a continuall aduersary to reason, euer maligning and opposing it selfe against all her proceedings: the tale is briefly tolde by Ouid: 4. Metam: and more largely by Homer, 8. Odyss: and otherwise expounded by Plutarch, in his discourse of Homer. Ouid in the fourth of his transformations largely discourseth, how Leucothoe was turnd to a sprig of franckencense, and Clytie to an hearb called Heliotropium: that noting the sweet and odoriferous influence of the Sun, this expressing the nature and name of that hearb, euer turning towards the Sun.
               The Nymphs were all this while behinde hand in their songes: therfore the pastors were now suffred to pawse for a season: Pallas, Diana, and Venus, being referred to Licoris, Aresia, and Cassiopaea. Licoris the mery lasse, sayd as foloweth.

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , Minerua. She had a manly countenance and fierce: and glittering and flaming eyes. Her Helmet was of gold: wisdome shineth and is a glorius protection. Her head is therwith couered: wise men conceale their deuises and cogitations; which was the cause also, why commonly there was on her helmet, the image of a Sphinx, betokening silence and secrecie, hauing the head, face, and breast of a mayden, the wings of a bird, and the rest of the body like a Lyon: propounding obscure riddles, and deuouring those that could not vnfold them. Her speare is long: Valor and wisedome are mighty, and reach far. Her Shield is of Cristall: wisdome is bright and cleare. In her breast-plate was Gorgons head: wisdome is wonderfull to the wise, and maketh fooles amazed. The picture of Pallas, called Palladium, came downe from heauen into Troy; and, till it was gone, Troy could not be taken: wisdome is coelestiall, and the onely safegarde of Cities, and common wealths.
               
                  
                  Pallas was so called because shee slew Pallas a Gyant: or, of shaking her speare,

Minerua, à memoria, of memory, the treasury of wisdome: or, a minuendo, of diminishing: for, strength is diminished and weakned by earnest and continuall meditations: or, à minando, of menacing: for she is warlike as well as wise, and of Bellum, Warre, called also Bellona: though some distinguish them, making Pallas to note policie in wars; and Bellona, blood slaughter, murder, and destruction. Pallas bare away the name of the city of Athens, by bringing foorth the Olyue, noting fertilitie, more benef

                  Minerua was also the Goddes of spinning, weauing, and curious working of cloath: and therefore was she figured sometimes with a distaffe in her hand. She reiected the Crow for his tatling: blabs be no companions for wise men, who vse to think before they speak, and yet not vtter all they think. In his place, she admitted the Owle, who seeth in darknes, and is solitary and silent: all which properties are agreeable to the conditions of a Philosopher &amp; wise man. Athens was her chiefe delight: Athens was the most famous and learned Vniuersitie in all Greece; and she is the Lady of learning.

Iupiter offended, to see this fowle babe Vulcan take his mothers part, threw him out of heauen: and he falling in the Isle Lemnos, brake his legge.
               Historically, he raigned in Aegypt, was a stout warrior, halted by a wound receaued in battaile, &amp; first found out the way to make armor of Iron; which gaue cause to these poeticall conceipts, calling him the black smith, forger of armor for all the Gods. Vulcan was maryed to Venus: for, without naturall heate, no procreation. Vulcan strugleth with Minerua, but to no purpose; for, of that aether

                  Vulcan was also called Mulciber, quasi Mulcifer, quià mulcet ferrum: because the fire doth mollifie the hardnes of Iron, and maketh it malleable. He is paynted with a hat, as I sayd before, lame, black, swartie, filthy, for all the world like a smith at his forge.

               Luckles, vnhappy nephew Acteon, ioyed in hunting,
               Ouermuch hunting, til his own hounds hunted his own-self.
               And yet no mischiefe did he work, but suffred a mischaunce,
               No fault, but Fortune, causd his poore head to be horned.
               
                  Acteon on a time from his house vntimely departed,
               And to the green wood went with his hounds and hunts-men about him.
               Morning all was spent, and Phoebus loftily mounted
               Iust twixt East and Weast, drew euery shade to be shortest.
               Mates, sayd Acteon, it's now ful time to be resting;
               Wee haue had good sport: now burning Phoebus on each side
               Scalds vs, take vp toyles, and cease any more to be toyling;

                  Acteons counsel was lik'te, his company rested,
               Tooke vp tooles and toyles, and ceas't for a while to be toyling.
               There was a Dale, with Pine and Cypresse daintily shaded,
               Called Gargaphia, sacred to the Lady Diana.
               
               In whose furthest end was a playne and natural harbor,
               And yet so pleasant, so sweet, so chearful a harbor,
               That no arte could stayne this playne and natural harbor:

               And no sooner was that Virgin Lady ariued,
               But qviuer, sharp dartes, and vnbent bow she deliu'red

               But whilst Lady regent with a naked company guarded,
               Washt her self in spring, and no-mans company feared,
               In comes Acteon, from sleeping company seu'red,
               In comes Acteon, by chance, to the company naked.
               Naked Nymphs seeing, that a man saw them to be naked,
               Smote their naked breasts, and made so woful an out-cry,
               That woods, wells, and caues in like sorte yeelded an out-cry:
               And with naked breasts gaue cour'ing vnto the naked
               Goddes their mistres, ioynd all in a round, in a compas.
               But their matchles Queene, and Sou'raigne Lady Diana
               
               Was too talle to be hid by that same company naked,
               Ouer-lookt them quite, and so was seene to be naked:
               And like scarlet clowdes, where Tytans beams be reflected,
               Was their Mistres face, when she was seene to be naked:
               Red for shame, and red for griefe: for shame to be naked,
               And for griefe much more, for griefe to be taken vnarmed.
               Yet, thogh weaponles, she raught both hands to the wel-spring▪

               Naked, spare not a whit. This short narration ended,
               Poore Acteons head with an ould Harts hornes she adorned,
               Made eares sharp, nose flat, neck long, made armes to be spindle
               Shancks, and fingers feet, and couered al with a specled
               Hyde: and least any part of a Hart should seeme to be wanting,
               Fearful thoughts, and fleeting legges are giu'n to the hartles

                  But when he came to a brook, &amp; saw his head to be horned,
               And mouth enlarged, poore Hart, with terror amased
               Whould haue cryed, Alas: but, alas, poore soule he deliu'red
               Not so much as, Alas: sighs and brayes onely remayned
               For to bewray his griefe, and teares powr'd foorth with abundance,
               Trickling down his checks, not his own cheeks now, but a Harts cheeks.
               Of th'ould Acteon, th'ould minde now onely remayneth;
               And this same ould minde is tost and turnd with a thousand
               Conceits, cares, and feares. For, what shal he doe? shal he go home
               Vnto the King and Queene, or wander alone by the desert?
               Shame driu's Acteon fro the one; and feare fro the other:
               Shame, on a King and Queene with a horned face, to be staring,
               Feare, for a man forelorne by the desert stil to be wandring.
               As thus he stood doubting, his dogs espied his horned
               Head, light Loelaps first, with nimble-footed Aello
               
               Called alowd to the rest; and then whole kennel aproached:

               Pamphagus, Agriodos, Pterelas, Hylaeus, Hylactor:
               These and as many more, through thick and thinne, by the wayles
               Wayes, by the rocks and clyffes, by the hedge and ditch, by the desert
               Run for a pray, and poore Acteon runs from his owne houndes,
               And is chac'te himself, who was so lately a chacer,
               Hunted of hounds himself, who that same day was a hunter:
               
                  Acteon makes sporte and play with his houndes in a morning,
               And that self same day is a pray to his hounds by the eu'ning.
               Oftentimes did he strayne himself, and sought to be speaking
               Vnto his houndes, O leaue, leaue your vnnatural outrage,
               Let your master alone: But no words could be aforded:
               And the redoubled crie in mean time rang by the forrest.
               Greedy Melanchaetes did pinch him first by the haunches,
               Next came Theridamas: Oresitrophos hangd by the shoulder.
               These last, though latest, by crossing ouer a hill top,
               Gayne-coapte Acteon, and held him fast, til his other
               Hounds came trolling in: Who all so greedily fastned

               Groaned at euery gripe, and brayed at euery biting,

               Where poore Acteon, God knowes, did wish to be absent,
               But was forced, alas, to be too vnluckily present,
               And saw more then he sought, &amp; felt much more thē he lookt for.

Diana was sister to Phoebus, and daughter to Latona as I sayd before; Lady of hunting, regent of woods. Diana is so called, as if a man would say Deuiana, a stragler or wanderer: for, the Moone strayeth from the Eclipticall line, as hunts-men wander in woods and forrests, or els she may be called Diana, quià diem praecedit, because she is, as it were, a fore-runner to the day. She is also called Luna, à luce, of her light: figured with a sweet and amiable looke, and maydenlike face, her garments tuckt vp, her quiuer on her back, a fire brand in her hand: noting either the pinching torments of child-birth, whereof she also (by reason of her moysture) in a Goddes, or the light which shee afordeth for direction of men in the night season, wherof she is the gouernesse.

She had three faces, called for that, Triuia, Triformis, and Tergemina. For, in heauen she is called Luna, in the woods Diana, vnder the earth Hecate, or Proserpina. That of these three faces, which was on the right side, was the face and head of a horse, figuring the swif

The left was of a dogge, noting that when she hideth her self from vs, she is then Proserpina with her hellish hounde: the middle was of a boare, signifying her iurisdiction in fields and forrests. When the Gods fled into Aegypt, for feare of Typhoeus, and euery one transformed himselfe to some vncoth shape, Luna turned herselfe into a cat; who seeth in the night, aswell as in the day: and her sight doth increase and decrease, accordingly and proportionably to the Moone.

               It is historically reported, that Cadmus vanquishing one Draco, King of Beotia, established himselfe in his throne: and that afterwards, being beset with the friends of the dead King, who all combined themselues together to reuenge his death, he politikely, with seditious rumors, set them together by the eares among themselues, and so distracting and seuering their forces, easilie ouercame them: and this he did, by the aduise of Pallas: it being a part of wisdome, by these meanes to weaken the aduersaries power, which otherwise vnited would be more strong. Others, by the dragons teeth sowed by Cadmus in Beotia, vnderstand letters, which he first brought out of Aegypt into Greece: and, by the seditious and murdering brethren, they meane the men learned and lettred, the one still confuting and oppugning the other.

                  Actaeon fed and maintained a number of idle and vnthankefull persons, noted by his doggs. Others expounde it thus: we ought not to be ouer curious and inquisitiue in spying and prying into those matters, which be aboue our reache, least we be rewarded as Actaeon was. Ouid. 2. de tristib.
               
               
                  Inscius Actaeon vidit sine veste dianam:
                  Praeda fuit canibus non minus ille suis.
                  Scilicet in superis, etiam fortuna luenda est,
                  Nec veniam laeso numine casus habet.
               
               Or lastly, thus, a wiseman ought to refraine his eyes, from beholding sensible and corporall bewty, figured by Diana: least, as Actaeon was deuoured of his owne doggs, so he be distracted and torne in peeces with his owne affections, and perturbations. The names of his hounds are all fet from the naturall qualities and proprieties of doggs: Laelaps, Aello, Nebrophonos, Dorceus, Harpya, Lycisca, Melampus, Pamphagus, Agriodos, Pterelas, Hylaeus, Hylactor, Melanchaetes, Theridamas, Oresitrophos: signifying, Swift, Tempest, Killbuck, Spy, Snatch, Woolfe, Blackefoote, Eateal, Sauage, Lightfoote, Woodman, Ringwood, Black▪ Kildeare, Hillebread.
               
                  Endymion watching in the night, to obserue the course of the Moone in the Hill Latmos, was said to be kissed of the Moone. Which may also be the cause

why they of Thessalia were saide to force the Moone downe from Heauen, with their charmes and incantations, for that they were very curious in noting her nature and reuolution. Endymion, by some others, is a figure of the soule of man, kissed of Diana in the hill, that is, rauished by celestiall contemplation.
               
                  Pan enticed the Moone into the woods, by giuing her a faire fleece of white wooll: that is to say, nature doth induce and perswade the soule, by the gift of sensible bewty, to come downe into this world of generation, and propagation signified by the wood; Virgil hath some such thing. 3.

               Faire Venus was now left for faire Cassiopaea: who thus discouered the loue betweene her and Adonis.
               
            
            
               
                  MYrrha, the fathers hoore, and brothers mother, a myrrhor
               Of most monstrus lust, was late transformd to a Myrrh-tree:
               O how could sweete Myrrh come from so sinful a Myrrha?
               
               
                  Myrrha made Myrrh-tree, brought forth incestuus ofspring,
               And yet most delicate, most sweete, most bewtiful ofspring,
               Dame Natur's dearling, heu'ns ioy, worlds woonder, Adonis.
               
               Either take wings, bowe, and shafts from louely Cupido,
               
               Or giue bowe and shafts, and wings to the loued Adonis;
               And let louely Cupid stand hard by loued Adonis
               
               Either on others side, and aske, who list, the beholders,
               Which is louely Cupid, which is this loued Adonis;
               Euery man will swere, that both are louely Cupidoes,
               
               Both are Lords of loue, and neither loued Adonis,
               
               So like euery way were loue and loued Adonis.
               
               Yea such grace, such face, such eyes had loued Adonis,
               
               That very Enuies eyes must needes praise loued Adonis.
               
               Lord, how swift is time, and slideth away on a sudden
               Vnperceaud, vnspide? That wretched, lewdly begotten,
               Sisters, grandsires son, closd yesterday in a Myrrhe-tree,
               Borne but yesterday, is now so louely an infant,
               Sweete childe, tall springall, braue youth; that Queene Cytheraea
               
               Loues natures dearling, heu'ns ioy, worlds woonder Adonis.
               
               Lord of loue, by a chaunce, as he playd with Queene Aphrodite
               
               His louing mother, did rase her breast with an arrowe.
               Hence, qd Lady Venus, with this same paltery arrowe;
               
                  And putts back her son: but that same paltery arrow
               Gaue her a deeper wound indeede, then first she beleeued.
               Now Cytheraean bowres and towres Cytheraea renounceth,
               Fishy Cnidos, with watry Paphos Cytheraea refuseth,
               Yea leaues heau'n it selfe for loue, for loue of Adonis.
               
               Now she delites to be gay, and frames her lookes to be louely,
               Trims and tricks her selfe, and all for loue of Adonis.
               
               Sometimes downe by a well with Adonis sweetly she sitteth,
               And on Adonis face in well-spring louely she looketh,
               And then Adonis lipps with her owne lipps kindely she kisseth,
               Rolling tongue, moyst mouth with her owne mouth all to be sucking,
               Mouth and tong and lipps, with Ioues drinck Nectar abounding.
               Sometimes, louely records for Adonis sake, she reciteth;
               How Laeander dyde, as he swamme to the bewtiful Hero
                  ▪
               
               How great Alcides was brought from a club to a distaffe,
               How Medea the witch causd golden fleece to be conquerd,
               What lost Euridice; who first came safely to Circe.
               
               Sometimes vnto the shade of a braunched beech she repaireth,
               Where sweete bubling brooke with streames of siluer aboundeth,
               And faire-feathred birde on tree-top cherefuly chirpeth;
               There her voyce, which makes eu'n Ioue himselfe to be ioying,
               Vnto the waters fall, and birds chirpe ioyfuly tuning.
               Sometimes vnto the woods, and pleasant parks she resorteth▪
               
               With tuckt-vp garments, and Quiuer, like to Diana.
               
               And there harmeles game pursu's with loued Adonis,
               
               Trembling hare, swift hart, and Roebuck loftyly horned:
               As for Beares, and Woolu's, and such wilde beasts, she detested,
               Lest any harme might chaunce, by the chace thereof, to Adonis.
               
               Whilst that Lady Venus did thus conuerse with Adonis,
               
               Making more account of a heauens-ioy, then a heauen,
               
                  Ioue sent forth summons through purple-veiled Olympus,
               
               Forth-with commaunding all Gods and euery goddes,
               There at a stately triumph, on a certeine time to be present.
               Then was Lady Venus compelld to returne to Olympus
               
               Greatly against her minde, and leaue her loued Adonis:
               
               And yet afore she returnd, shee turnd herselfe to Adonis,
               
               And thus tooke her leaue, last leaue of loued Adonis.
               
               Sweete boy, sith that I must of force now goe to Olympus,
               
               (Neuer afore did I so vnwilling goe to Olympus)
               Make much of thyself, and ile make haste from Olympus.
               
               Sweete boy, looke to thyself, goe not too oft to the forrest,
               Where sharpe-tusked boares, and rau'nous woolus be resorting,
               
                  And strong stoordy Lyons are each where fearefuly roaring.
               Parks and launds are walkes more meete for yonker Adonis,
               
               Harts and Hyndes are game more fit for gentle Adonis.
               
               Tis no wit, sweete boy, with a greater foe to be striuing,
               Tis no wit, to be stout with strong, to be haughty with hardy:
               Forbeare for my sake, for my feare learne to be fearefull,
               Meddle not with beasts, whose euery limme is a weapon,
               Euery stroake is death: least too stowtharted Adonis
               
               Buy his praise too deare: thy face, yeares, bewty, behauiour
               Which possesse my soule, wil neuer moue the deuouring
               Woolues, and bristled swine, wil neuer finde any fauour
               In blood-thirsting eyes of a rugged bare, or a raging
               Ougly Lyon, most ougly Lyon; whose merciles ofspring
               Chiefly of all other wilde beasts Cytheraea detesteth.
               Then she begins to recount, how fayre and swift Atalanta
               
               Chaunst at length in race to be ouercome, by the golden
               Apples, which herselfe of her owne grace, gaue to the thanckles
               
                  Hippomenes, whose loue was therefore turnd to a lewd lust,
               So lewd; that Cybeles temple was fowly defiled,
               And themselues to Lyons, for a iust plague, speedily changed,
               Drawing her chariot, whose church they lately prophaned.
               Then, qd shee, fly these; and not these only, but all those
               Beasts, that will not fly. Such counsel gaue she Adonis,
               
               But no such counsel would serue too youthful Adonis.
               
               For, no sooner was sweete sea-borne Nymph Aphrodite
               
               Conueyd in chariot by siluer swans to Olympus,
               
               But to the wilde wood went too wilde and wilful Adonis:
               
               Where, when his hounds on a time, by chaunce, had rowzed a wilde-boare,
               Himselfe sets on first, and boare in a brauery woundeth.
               Boare enrag'de, runs forth, with foaming tusk, to Adonis,
               
               And teares those very parts, those tendrest parts of Adonis,
               
               Which were stil most deare to Adonis deare Aphrodite,
               
               Teares, and wounds, and kills Aphrodites loued Adonis.
               
               And now, eu'n iust now, when wilde Boare murdred Adonis,
               
               
                  Ioues great guests were gone, and all solemnities ended,
               And sweete louely Venus from Olympus newly departed;
               Thinking euery howre to be two, and two to be twenty,
               Til she beheld her boy: but alas too soone, she beheld him:
               Downe fro the skies she beheld her long-lookt loued Adonis
               
               Dismembred, wounded, with his owne blood all to besprinckled.
               Then to the dolefull dale, where murdred Adonis abideth,
               Her milke-white coursers, with might and maine she directeth,
               
                  Leaps downe, rents her roabes, and poore breast all to bebeateth,
               Teares hayre, scratcheth face, and deathswound deadly bewaileth.
               Hellish Fates, qd shee, though world be depriu'd of Adonis
               
               Corps, and loued lymmes, by you; yet world, to the worlds end,
               In despite of you, shall yearely remember Adonis,
               
               Yearely remember mee, by remembring yearely Adonis.
               
               Yea, this purpled blood wil I speedily turne to a purple
               Flowre; which shalbe a grace to the ground insteede of Adonis.
               
               If that Apollo could transforme his boy Hyacinthus
               
               Into a flowre for a fame, to the mourning flowre Hyacinthus,
               
               Which stil beares, ay, ay, in leaues, in signe of a wailing:
               If that Apollo could his dolefull boy Cyparissus,
               
               Turne to a dolefull tree, to the ioyles deadly Cupressus,
               
               Shall not Lady Venus doe the like for loued Adonis?
               
               Then with life-giuing Nectar, sweete blood she besprinkleth,
               And the besprinkled blood, with a round top swells, as a buble:
               Purpled round by degrees, is speedily changd to a purpled
               Flowre, that beares faire leaues, and fraile leaues; euery winde-puffe
               Blowes them away. So good things goe, so dyed Adonis:
               
               Flowre fades, eye dazeleth, face wrinkleth, bewty decayeth.
            
            
               
                  CAssiopaea, said Elpinus, hath so passionately discoursed of Venus and Adonis, that I feare me, vnder these names, she mourneth her owne loue, and vttreth her owne affection. Howsoeuer it be; Saturnus, that is, Tyme, with his sithe, as I said elsewhere, cut off his fathers manlike parts: of which, cast into the sea, Venus was borne. So Saturne destroyeth, Venus bringeth foorth; and both are necessary for the continuall propagation of these inferior bodies, sith the corruption of one, is the generation of another. Venus is faire, bewty enticeth to lust. She is naked, loue cannot be concealed. She is borne of the sea, louers are inconstant, like the troubled waues of the sea: Hereof was shee also called Aphrodite, of the froath of the sea, being like to Sperma. Shee is called Venus, qd ad omnia veniat, or else, à venustate: Swans and Doues drawe her chariot; Doues are wanton, and Swans are white and musicall, both being meanes to procure loue and lust. Myrrha is sacred vnto her, so is the rose also: that, because it is thought to cause loue; this, because it is fayre and fraile, pleasant and pricking, hauing a thorne aswell as a flowre, as loue hath. In Saxony, she was figured naked, in a chariot drawne with two Swannes and two doues, her head bound with myrtle leaues, a burning starre on her breast, a globe representing the earth, in her right hand, and three golden apples in her left: Behinde her were the three graces, back to back, hand in hand, and apples in their hand.
               
                  
The first picture of Venus.
               Now, for Venus her loue to Adonis, and lamentation for his death: by Adonis, is meant the sunne, by Venus, the vpper hemisphere of the earth (as by Proserpina the lower) by the boare, winter: by the death of Adonis, the absence of the sunne for the sixe wintrie moneths; all which time, the earth lamenteth: Adonis is wounded in those parts, which are the instruments of propagation: for, in winter the son seemeth impotent, and the earth barren: neither that being able to get, nor this to beare either fruite or flowres: and therefore Venus sits, lamentably hanging downe her head, leaning on her left hand, her garments all ouer her face.

                  Pontanus expresseth it thus,

                     Terra etenim solem queritur deserta cadentem,
                     Inuidit quem tristis hyems, cui saeuior apri
                     Horret cana gelu facies, cui plurimus imber
                     Crine madet, geminos &amp; cùm malè contudit armos.
                     Ac veluti virgo absenti cum sola marito
                     Suspirat sterilem lecto traducere vitam,
                     Illius expectans amplexus anxia charos:
                     Cum grauidos aperit
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         sinus, &amp; terra relaxat
                     Spiramenta, nouas veniat quà succus in herbas,
                     Diglomerat
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         niues, &amp; grandine verberat auras.
                     Nam cùm sol rebus praesit pater ipse creandis,
                     Vt sese ad manes brumae sub frigore transfert,
                     Tum tellus vidua sulcos oblimat in alno,
                     Et tandem complexa suum laetatur Adonim.
                  
               
               
                  Adonis was turnd to a fading flowre; bewty decayeth, and lust leaueth the Iust full, if they leaue not it. Equicola, expoundeth it thus: Adonis was borne of Myrrha; Myrrhe prouoketh lust: Adonis was kilde by a boare, that is, he was spent and weakened by old age: Venus lamenteth, lust decayeth.
               The companions of Venus were the three Graces; virgins▪ free, mery, amiable, all ioyning together. So good turns must bee willingly aforded without grudging. Some make Mercury their leader, because good turns ill bestowed, be bad turns; benefacta malè collocata malèfacta arbitror, therefore wisdome and discretion figured by Mercury, is here requisite. The first of them is Euphrosyne, of 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , to make mery, to cheare and comfort: the second Aglaia of 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , to bewtifie. The third Pithus, of 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , to perswade; or, Thalia
                  ▪ florishing, as others name her. Some make them winged, because a good turne is little worth, vnles it come quickly.
               
                  
                  Gratia, quae tarda est, ingrata est gratia: namque
                  Cùm properat fieri gratia, grata magis.
               
               Two of them looke towards vs, and one fromwards vs: we must yeeld double thanks, and double requitall for good turnes. They be in greeke called 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , of mirth and ioy. Natalis Comes referreth it to the tilling and fertiltie of the earth.

                         Graces.
                  
               
               The one hath in her hand a rose, the second a Dye the third a braunch of mirtle. The rose noteth ioy: the Dye is a token, that they ought to come in course. The myrtle, that they should neuer be forgotten but alwaies florish and continue fresh and greene.
               Before wee leaue Venus, wee must remember her sonne Cupido, who, (to omit the philosophicall discourses of the Platonists concerning diuers loues) was pictured, a boy; louers are childish: blinde; they see no reason: naked; they cannot conceale their passions: winged; loue soone flieth into our eyes and soules, and louers are light, as feathers. His bowe and arrowes note, that he hitteth a farre off: his burning lampe, the quickning light, and yet consuming heate of loue, Dulcis amaror amor.
               
               
                  Venus hauing brought forth Cupid, and seeing that he did not thriue, and growe; was told by Themis, that if Eros had Anteros, if Cupid had another Cupid for his brother, who might contend in loue with him, he would doe well. Venus hereupon, brought forth Anteros, and presently Eros reuiued, loue was lusty: and, as the one increased or decreased, so did the other, neuer deliting, but either in others loue and liking. Eros was figured with a branche of palme in his hand: Anteros contended to wrest it from him, but could not. Hee that will be loued, must loue: vt amêris, amabilis esto. We must contend to ouercome and get the palme and victory, by louing more, then we be loued so shall we still be loued more, Fomes amoris amor.
                  
                     The picture of E and Antros.
                  
               
               Many yong waggs wayte on great Cupido: they are borne of Nymphs; yong, naked, and haue curled hayre, and changeable colored winges: sometimes with a lampe or a bowe, sometimes without either bowe or Lampe.
               
                  Moschus in his wandring and fugitiue Cupid, maketh him not blinde, but hauing bright and cleare eyes. Tasso hath the like in Italian, to that of Moschus in greeke.
               The particuler histories briefely tutcht in this tale, as by the way, may as briefely be thus expounded. Leander and Heroes loue is in euery mans mouth: the light of the lanterne or lampe extinct (that is, naturall heate fayling)

lust decayeth, and Leander tossed with the cold storme of old age, is at last drowned. Ouid in his epistles passionately setteth it downe, and Boscan hath made a whole volume of it in spanish, entituled Historia de Leandro y Hero, beginning thus,

                     Canta con voz suaue y dolorosa,
                     O musa, los amores lastimeros,
                     Que en suaue dolorfueron criados.

                  Hercules was also called Alcides, of 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                  ▪ force and might: he was the sun of Iupiter and Alemena: 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , is strength and prowes. So then, Hercules is the type of a valiant, constant, and resolute Heros, borne of Iupiter, that is, endued with all heauenly qualities effected by Ioues influence, and so borne, as to purchase himselfe eternall fame and glorious renowne through the world by his admirable aduentures: which for that they were attempted and atcheeued by the malitious instigation and prouocation of Iuno; himselfe was thereof in Greeke named accordingly: for, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , is Iuno; and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , glory, or renowne, as I haue already mentioned: others had rather deriue the name,

                  ▪ which noteth vertue &amp; valor. In his infancie he strangled two snakes; the meaning is, that he began euen then to represse wantonnes. Afterwards hee slew a Lyon; noting wrath, pride, and crueltie; &amp; ouercame Hydra, the almost inuincible, &amp; still breeding beast, Enuy. Hydra lurked in moores &amp; fennes; Enuy creepeth on the ground, in base and abiect brests. Troy could not be taken without his arrowes: his arrowes are a figure of heroical fortitude. He wrestled with Antaeus, who euer throwne downe to the earth, receaued new strength from the earth, till at last, hee lifted him vp, and strangled him in the ayre: so the spirit still striueth with the body, but neuer can ouercome it, till he lift it vp so high from the ground, that with his feete, to weete his affections, he receaue no new assistance from his mother the earth. Diomedes, who fed his mares with mans flesh, was by Hercules enforced to feede them with his owne body. By Diomedes mares, some vnderstand his whoorish daughters, who robbed and consumed all that came vnto them. He killed the mighty Hart, he freed mens hearts from feare. He was euer couered with the Lyons spoyle: a valiant man vseth open and Lionlike prowesse, and not treacherous and foxelike wiles. He brake one of the hornes of the huge riuer Achelous: he reduced one part of the saide riuer into his woonted course, which was the cause of great fertilitie to all the countrey: and therefore it is saide, that the horne was dekt with flowres, and called Cornucopiae, the Horne of aboundance. He fetcht away the golden apples of the Hesperides, kept by the watching Dragon: Hesperides, the daughters of Hesperus, are the starres: their garden is in the weast, wherein grow golden apples: for such is the nature of the starres, to glister like gold, and seeme round in shew like apples. They grow

in the weast, because the stars neuer appeare, but when the sunne setteth, and that is in the weast: for, all the day long they are obscured, by the surpassing light of the sunne. The neuer-sleeping Dragon, that watcheth these apples &amp; keepeth the garden, is the cyrcle, called Signifer. Hercules brought these int
                     •
                   Grece, that is, he brought Astrologie into his countrey. So was he, for the same cause, fayned to beare the heauens on his shoulders, whilst Atlas rested himself: because he learned Astrologie of Atlas: who is therefore sayd to holde vp the heauens, because he continually obserued the motions of the heauens, and was thereof called Atlas, of 
                     •
                   which here is a note of augmentation, and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , to beare and sustaine. The Pleïades and Hyades be called his daughters, because he first noted their course, and obserued their operation. Ouid in the fourth of his transformations maketh this Atlas to be a king of Mauritania, turned to a mountaine of his owne name, when Perseus had shewed him Gorgons head, for denying him entertainment. In trueth, Atlas is a most huge and high hill in Mauritania, so threatning the heauens, that it gaue beginning to this fiction. Sometimes Hercules is paynted olde and balde, with his club, bow, and shafts, &amp; smal chaynes or wyres drawen from his toung, to othermens eares: signifiyng, that his sweete toung wrought more, then his strong body: and that the aged eloquence is most piercing and auayleable, as Homer maketh manifest vnder the person of olde Duke Nestor.

               Thus did Hercules his searching and heroicall heart leaue nothing vnattempted: but by his reaching capacitie, and inquisitiue speculation, pierced through heauen and hel: yet alas he that ouercame all, was at last ouercome himselfe: He that mastred men, was whipped by a woman, and enforced by her to spinne and handle a distuffe in stead of an Iron clubbe: so doth wantonnes effeminate the most warlike hearts, and so much harder it is▪ to resist pleasure, then not to be ouercome by payne. At length hauing passed through so many perils, and being infected with a shirt sent him from Deïanira, and polluted with the venymous blood of the Centaure Nessus, he burnt himselfe on the mount Oeta: that is to say, his terrestriall body being purged and purified, himselfe was afterwards de

Medea therefore (that is, such as are wise and aduised) leaueth her father, &amp; teareth in peeces her brother and children: to weete, all such affections as might be a let vnto her, and flyeth away with Iason, the phisitian and curer of her infirmities, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , to heale or cure. But when Iason giues himselfe ouer to filthines, then doth Medea
                  ▪ good counsel, flie away in her chariot drawne with winged Dragons, noting wisdome and policie. Iason was many wayes endangered, before he could atchieue the golden fleece: there is no man that can attayne to any excellency, without extraordinarie labour. The golden fleece noteth either great riches and treasure, or fame and immortality.
               
                  
                  Euridice, the wife of Orpheus, figureth Appetitum, the coueting and desiring faculty in man. The serpent byting her heele, is affection &amp; concupisence: for, veynes come from the heeles to those parts which are the instruments of lust. Therefore when Thetis washt her sonne Achilles in the Stygian waters, he was inuiolate and vnwoundable in euery part of his body, sauing only his heele, by the which she held him when she washed him, and in the same heele was hee wounded by Paris in the temple of Apollo, when he came to mary Polixena, that is to say, affection and lust to Polixena drew on his confusion. In imitation whereof, the good Thomalin in the new Shepheards Kalender, singeth thus of the winged boy.
               
                  Therewith afrayd I ran away:
                  But he that earst seem'd but to play,
                  a shaft in earnest snatched:
                  And hit me running in the heele;
                  For then, I litle smart did feele,
                  but soone the sore increased:
                  And now it ranckleth more and more,
                  And inwardly it festreth sore,
                  ne wot I how to cease it.
               
               
                  Orpheus the husband of Euridice, an eloquent and wise man, so wrought the rude people, that he made them sociable and conformable: when he obteined the bringing backe of his wife from Hell, he was inioyned not once to looke back towards her: A wise man ought not to be withdrawen from his contemplation, by any passion or affection whatsoeuer.
               
                  Circe may be either physically or ethically expounded: physically thus, She was called Circe, à miscendo, of mingling and tempring: for in the generation of bodies, these foure elements, as we call them, must needs bee tempered: which commixtion and composition is done by the influence and operation of the Sunne: and therefore Circe was borne of the Sunne and Perseis, the daughter of Occanus. Perseis or Perse is the humor and moysture of the Ocean, supplying the place of the matter or the woman, as the sunne is the efficient or the man. Circe had foure maydens, the foure elements: they gathered hearbs and flowres for her witcherie; these elements are autors of all motions and alterations. Circe herselfe is immortall; the generation of things is perpetuall. She transformed men into diuers shapes: for, as I sayd before, the corruption of one is the generation of another, not the same, but altred and transformed. She dwelt in the Isle Aeaea, so called of the groaning and wayling of mortall bodies, which by reason of the decay and dissolution of this bodylie composition, are subiect to diseases and griefes: for, ae, ae, ai, ai, signifieth,

alas, alas. She could not transforme Vlysses: the soule cannot be destroyed, though his companions, noting the elements cohaerent to the body, were changed. Shee wrought many wonders by inchaunting, she darkned the Moone, stayed the waters, dryed the fountaynes, burnt grasse and hearbes, and so foorth; vnorderly mixtion or composition, with abundance of vapours lifted vp, darken the moone, and worke twenty such like inconueniences. Ethically thus, lust is caused of heate and moysture, the Sunne, and Perseis: If she ouer rule vs, she transformeth vs into the shapes of seuerall beasts, according to the sundry beastly pleasures wherein we delight: vnles some heauenly helpe be aforded vs, as was to Vlysses. so Homer fayneth some of Vlysses companions to be deuoured by Polypheme the Cyclops, some by the Lestrigones, and some swallowed vp of Scylla, and such as were not dismayed with perils and daungers, did yet yeeld and giue ouer themselues to pleasure and sensualitie, whereof diuers became effeminate with the delicacie of the wanton Phaeaces: and others in the region of the Lothophagi, by tasting forren fruit, did forget their own coūtrey. The third sort, that resisted both pleasure &amp; paine, was ouercome with couetise; and, whilst Vlysses slept, opened the bagg stuft with winde (which Aeolus shut vp, and gaue to Vlysses) hoping it had been stoared with treasure. Lastly, a number of them drawen away with ambition and vayn-glorie, would haue yeelded to the deceiptfull sweetnes of the Syrenes, had not their Capten stopped their eares with waxe, as I sayd els-where, and caused himself to be bound to the mast of the ship: only Vlysses escaped▪ by heauenly help only, and liued with Circe familiarly.

They being made Lyons, are afterwards tamed, bridled, and enforced to draw Cybeles chariot: by olde age lust and loue are calmed. Hyacinthus his death teacheth vs not to toy; and Cyparissus, not to mourne too much for a thing of naught.
               The Pastors being now ouertaken by the Nymphs, began to bestirre themselues: among others, Ergastus, whose course was then come, ioyned Hermaphroditus to his mother Venus, much after this manner.

               Would say, Lady Venus bare Mercury Hermaphroditus.
               
               Water-nymphs for a time brought vp this yonker in Ida;
               But when sixteen yeares were spent by the yonker in Ida,
               
               Yonker could not abide, to abide any longer in Ida.
               
               All his ioy was now his fortune for to be trying,
               And forren countreyes with curius eye to be seeing,
               And outlandish wells, and vnknowne springs to be knowing.
               After much traueling, many strange sights, and many wonders;
               At last, from Lycian borders his course he directed
               Vnto the neighbor coasts of Caria: where he ariued
               Hard by a cristall poole, poole cristal-cleare to the bottome,
               And so 
                     •
                  ransparent, that a man might easily number
               Euery smalest stone, from th'vtmost brim to the bottome.
               There no barren reeke, no pricking reede was abounding,
               There no sedge, no rush, no moorish weede had abiding:
               But with fayre green turfe pooles brinck was chearfuly bordred,
               Green turfe with fresh flowres &amp; sweet hearbs daintily painted.
               There no boyes pluckt flowres their gay nose gaies to be making,
               Nor no nymphs: but a nymph: one nymph, and only but one nymph,
               One and only but one; but no such one in a thousand.
               For, neither car'd shee farre-wounding bow to be bearing,
               Nor with quick-sent hounds by the green-hewd woods to be hunting,
               Nor with water-nymphs by the smiling meades to be walking,
               Nor to Dianaes court with tuckt-vp coate to be trudging.
               Her feallow Fayries, stil prayd, and dayly desired;
               
                  Salmacis, either take thee a darte, or a feathered arrow,
               And intermingle these idle toyes, with a fruitfull
               And commendable acte, and sporte of mighty Diana.
               
               Yet she neither tooke her a darte, nor a feathered arrow,
               
                  Nor would intermingle her idle toyes, with a fruitful
               And commendable act, and sport of mighty Diana:
               
               But contents her self with dayly domestical Harbor:
               Bathes her loued limmes, fit for so louly a water,
               Sits on flowring banck, and combs her sweetly beseeming
               Hayre, &amp; lookes to the lake, and guides her combe by the water.
               Now her fayrest self, with finest lawne she adorneth,
               And fayre self, fine lawne on tender grasse she reposeth:
               Now fro the paunce to the rose, fro the rose to the lilly she wandreth,
               And herself with paunce, with rose, with lilly she paynteth.
               Whilst she bepaynts her self with a paunce, with a rose, with a lilly,
               Hard by the pearl-bright brooke, she beheld fayre Hermaphroditus,
               
               
                  Hermaphroditus a far; so like to a God, to a goddes;
               That shee wisht him a God, yet feard that he might be a Goddes.
               But when man-like roabes declar'd that he was not a woman,
               
                  Salmacis all on fire his diuine beautie desired,
               
                  Salmacis all on thornes, for so sweete company longed,
               Yet stayd, though on thornes, til her head, face, coate she had ordred,
               And made all things fine, and then to the boy she repayred.
               O sweete boy, whose more then mortall beauty deserueth
               For to be deemed a God, what God shal I call the my sweete boy?
               If that thou be a God, thou seemst to be goodly Cupido:
               
               If but a man, most happy the man, who might be thy father,
               Happy the woman, whom thy sweet self mad'st to be mother,
               Happy the Nymph, whom so braue brother causd to be sister,
               Happy the nurse, whose milk did feede so chearful a suckling:
               But much more blessed, but much more happy then all these,
               Were that lasse indeede, who might be thy wife, be thy bed-make:
               If thou haue any wife, let mee be thy loue for a short time,
               If thou haue no wife, let mee be thy friend for a long time:
               Whether a husband bound, or whether free as a batchler,
               Giue me a lawfull ioy, or priuily doe me a pleasure.
               Thus she bespake sweete boy; but alas, sweet boy was abashed,
               Knew not what loue was, but blusht, yet sweetly he blushed,
               And wel, too too wel that blushing beauty beseemed.
               
                  Salmacis askt but a kisse, when naught els might be procured,
               And fayre Iuory neck with her Iuory handes she beclasped:
               Either let me alone, or I goe, said Hermaphroditus.
               
               Nay, sweet friend, qd shee, stay here and play to thy pleasure,
               Stay and play by the poole, Ile goe: and so she retireth,
               And drawes back for a while, (yet looks back as she retyreth)
               Drawes back vnto a bush; and there all closely she lurketh,
               
                  And through euery creeke, to the boy shee craftily peepeth.
               Boy, vnspi'd, as he thought, as boys are wont, was a wandring
               Here and there by the meade; and comes at last to the water;
               Puts of his hose and shooes, and dips his feete to the anckles
               In the bedabling waues, that seem'd his toes to be tickling.
               By and by, draw'n on, by the coole and temperat humor
               Ofth'alluring lake, himselfe stark naked he stripped.
               But when Salmacis once had seene fayre Hermaphroditu
                        •
                     
                  
               
               Stript stark naked, alas her loue was turnd to a lusting,
               Lust to a rage, and rage to a fire, and fire to a flaming.
               Hardly she holdeth her hāds, she desires him now to be hādling,
               And all impatient his snow-white skin to be tutching.
               Stript boy leaps to the lake, lake serues as a veile to the stript boy,
               Bright transparent veile, as a glasse to a rose, or a lillie.
               Hid Nymph runs fro the bush, dispoyles her selfe in a moment,
               Casteth away her Lawnes, and flings her selfe to the water,
               Takes hold, embraces, clips, colls, clasps Hermaphroditus,
               
               (Striuing and strugling and wrestling Hermaphroditus)
               
               Feeles his naked lims, and sweete lipps all to be sucketh,
               Sticks fast, spraules, and turnes, and windes him about, as an Yuie
               Creepeth along on a tree, or a snake cleaues fast to an Egle,
               Snake snatcht vp fro the ground, by the gryping clawes of an Egle.
               Fond boy stil stil striues, and stil stil Salmacis vrgeth,
               And bowes her whole-selfe, bends her whole-selfe to the fond boy,
               Weighs him downe at last, and there lies all to be wrapped,
               All intangled lies, all intermingled about him.
               Peeuish boy, qd shee, now wrythe and wrest the a thousand
               Wayes, no way shall serue, for thus wil I holde the for euer.
               O, would God, would God, that I might so holde the for euer.
               Her boone was graunted: they liu'd so ioyntly for euer;
               They were one, not two: two coopled, yet not a coople,
               Neither boy nor wench, but a wench-boy now, or a boy-wench,
               Both, yet none of both; either, yet neither of either.
               When poore youth perceau'd this transformation, and saw
               Whereas he entred a man, that he turned back but a halfe-man:
               Eyes, and heart, and hand, and voyce, (but now not a mans voyce)
               Vp to the heau'ns did he lift, effeminat Hermaphroditus:
               
               Father, Mother, graunt this fountayne so to be charmed,
               That who goes in a man, may thence come foorth but a half-man.
               
                  Hermaphroditus chaunce, moude Hermes and Aphrodite:
               
               And for a worthy reuenge, that well they speedily charmed,
               That who goes in a man, comes alwayes foorth but a halfe-man.
            
            
               
               
                  ELpinus was as briefe, as Ergastus had been tedious in his tale of his two wantons. If, qd he, at any mans birth, there be a coniunction of Venus and Mercurie, it maketh him neither man nor woman, both woman and man, giuen to inordinate and vnnaturall lust, noted by Salmacis. For these two planets are so repugnant, that they can neuer be well conioyned; sith Venus is all for the body, and Mercury onely for the minde.
               LA secreta intelligentia di questa fauola, secondo alcuni, è, che nelle matrici delle donne sono sette le stanze che rioglieno il seme dell' huomo: tre dalla parte destra, che producono i maschi, e tre dalla sinistra, che producono le femine, &amp; vna nel mezzo, laquale ricogliendo il seme, ha forza di produrre l'uno e l'altro sesso insieme. e per questa cagione, vogliono dire, che Hermaphrodito nascesse di Mercurio, hauendo Venere raccolto il seme in quella stanza del mezzo: e pero sono chiamati &amp; sono Hermaphroditi tutti quelli che sono concetti nella medesima stanza.
               Meliboeus now lastly remayned of all the Pastors: who thus sent lusting Bacchus after wanton Venus.
            
            
               
                  CAdmeian Semele was great with child by the thundrer,
               Great with childe and quick. Whereat Saturnian Empres
               
                  Iuno, frets and fumes; and brawles and scoldes with her husband,
               At last, what bootes it, qd shee, my winde to be wasting,
               As though in fore-times Ioue gaue any eare to my scolding?
               Nay nay, workes, not wordes must plague that drabbe, that adultre
                     •
                  
               
               What? shall Iuno the Queene by a shameles queane be abused?
               
                  Iuno the Sou'raigne Queene? shal I raigne in skies with a golden
               Mace and scepter in hand, and yet parte stakes with a strumpet?
               If that an outcome whore be my mistres, why am I called
               
                  Ioues wife and sister? Nay sister alone: for I beare this
               Name of a wife for a shew, Ioues secret scapes to be cou'ring.
               Secret? nay shee vaunts, and takes a delight in her open
               Shame; shee's bagd forsooth, and great with childe with a vengeance;
               And lookes euery day and howre to be called a mother
               Of some brat, by a God, by a greatest God, by a thundring
               
                  Ioue; which scarce hath chaunc'te in so many yeares to a Iuno,
               
               But let my mistres no more take mee for a Iuno,
               
               If that I make her not with her owne mouth aske for her owne death,
               If that I make not Ioue, yea Ioue himselfe, to be autor
               
                  Of this death. This sayd, inclosde in a clowde, she remoued:
               And to the huswifes house, in a ielous fury repayred.
               Foltring toung, hoare hayre, sunck eyes, legs lasily limping,
               Face plowde with wrinckles, did make her like to the olde nurse,
               Olde Beldam Beroe, Semeles nurse. And, of a purpose,
               After long tatling, at length shee came to the name of
               
                  Iupiter, and then sight and sayd: Deare daughter, I pray God,
               That this prooue to be Ioue; but I doubt: for, alas, many harlots
               Vnder a fained name of Gods haue fouly deceaued
               Good-naturd damsels, and them with follie defiled.
               But suppose he be Ioue: yet that's not enough for a maydens
               Minde, vnles that he shew himselfe to be truly the thundring
               
                  Ioue: for, a disguisde Ioue is no Ioue: aske him a token,
               Aske him a signe thereof, deare childe: and surely, beleeue mee,
               No signe's sufficient, vnles that he company with thee,
               In that self-same sort as he doth with Iuno the Goddes,
               In that Princelike guise, in that maiestical order,
               With Sou'raigne scepter, with fire and thunder about him.
               Simple soule Semele, instructed thus by the Beldam,
               Asked a boone of Ioue, as soone as he came to the entry,
               But tolde not what boone: Ioue graunts, &amp; sweares by the sacred
               Horror of hellish Stix, that he would performe what he graūted.
               Why then, qd 
                  Semele, let mee kisse Ioue as a thundring
               And bright lightning Ioue, no lesse then Iuno the Goddes.
               
                  Ioue would fayne haue stopt her foolish mouth: but a fooles bolt
               Was soone, too soone shot, which Ioue extreamly molested:
               For, neither Semele could vnwish what she had once wisht,
               Nor lamenting Ioue vnsweare that which he had once sworne.
               Therefore sore displeased, he gets himselfe to Olympus,
               
               And with a stearne countnance and grim look, heaps on a cluster
               Thick clowds, blustring winds, black storms, fires fearfuly flashing,
               And th'vndaunted dint of thunders mightily roaring:
               And yet he makes himselfe as milde as he possibly may bee,
               And allayes his Sou'raigne force, and leaues the deuouring
               Fearful thunderbolt, that stroke downe griefly Typhoeus.
               
               There is an other kinde of thunder: there is a lightning
               Framed much more light, and of lesse might, by the Cyclops,
               
               Cald the second scepter: this he takes, and comes to the chamber
               Of longing Semele: who prowd and vayne as a woman,
               With fond selfe conceit drew self-destruction onwards.
               For, mortal Semele was quite consum'd in a moment
               By th'immortal strength, and matchles might of a thundrer.
               
                  Yet, th'imperfect fruite fro the mothers wombe he remoued,
               And (so ran the report) in his owne thigh strangely receau'd it,
               Til by continuance of time it grew to a ripenes,
               And the apoynted time by degrres was come to a fullnes.
               Then by his aunt Ino, for a while was he charily fostred,
               And soone after that, to the Nimphs of Nysa, deliu'red:
               And good-natur'd Nymphs from Iuno warily kept him
               In bowres and harbors, and gaue him milk for a season.
               This same twice-borne babe at length was called Iacchus,
               
               Sweete boy, pleasant impe, fayre lad, braue yonker Iacchus,
               
               Neuer sad, free-tongd, free-hart, free-handed Iacchus,
               
               And, when he wanteth his horns, as milde as a maiden, Iacchus,
               
               But, when he hath on his horns, as fierce as a Tyger, Iacchus.
               
            
            
               WHether Meliboeus bee beholding to Bacchus, or Bacchus to Meliboeus, I meane not to determine, said Elpinus: but this I haue heard, that Bacchus, a mightie warriour, ouercame Lycurgus, Pentheus, and diuers others, and subdued India, riding thence in triumphant manner, on an Elephant. Yet his greatest fame was procured by his inuention of wine, which hath made him painted and described accordingly, a yong mery youth, naked, crowned with an yuy garland, hauing a branch of a vine in his hand, riding in a chariot drawne by Tygers and Panthers: First, Bacchus is mery, Wine moderately taken▪ maketh men ioyfull; he is also naked; for, in vino veritas: drunkards tell all, and sometimes more then all. Tygers draw his chariot; druncken men are fierce and outragious. Of Venus and Bacchus, Priapus was borne: lust comes from wine and delicacie.

He was sowed into Ioues thigh, and so borne againe: for, wine is eftsoones pressed and troaden with feete. He is a companion of the Muses: wine quickeneth the wit. Women be his priests: women are sooner ouercome with wine, then men. He was, of the Aegyptians called Osiris; and was torne in peeces by the Titanes, and enterred, and yet reuiued, and had his seuered limmes laid together againe: For, of euery twig or braunch or grift of the vinetree, cut off, and burieed in the earth, whole vinetrees spring forth againe. He hath sometimes hornes, then is he intolerable, and fierce, like a Bull, being drunke immoderately. Satyres, and such wantons be his folowers; and among the rest, Silenus is his Tutor, a fat, grosse, stammering drunckard, balde, and flatnosde, with great cares, short neck▪ and swelling bely, riding on an asse, as not able, for swelling, to stand

on his feete; all effects of beastly carowsing. The water-nymphs tooke him from the burnt ashes of his mother, and brought him vp: the vine-tree is moyst of nature: or rather, the burning fire of Bacchus, must be quenched, wine must be allaied. He is called Bacchus,

               The Pastors hauing all made an end; Syluia, Dieromena, and Daphne, had yet said nothing. Syluia therefore remembred Pomona: and Dieromena in meane time, made herselfe ready for Rhamnusia: as for good old Daphne, she was odd in number, and as odd in conceit, and therefore very like, either to say nothing, or nothing like to that which had been said before. Syluia spake, as here ensueth.
            
            
               IN King Procae's time, Pomona, the Lady of apples
               Floorisht:

                  aire Pomona, the brauest nimph of a thousand
               Wood-nimphs: no wood-nimph was found so good for a garden,
               None so circumspect, so cunning was, for an orchyarde.
               No wells, no waters, no hills, no dales she frequented,
               Fishing, and fouling, and hunting life she refused,
               Fruite, and fruite-bearing branches Pomona desired,
               Gardens were her ioy, and all her care was her orchyard.
               Insteede of keene darts, shee arm's herself with a shredding
               Hooke, and therewith cutts and pares the super

               Which well sparde, makes stock to be strong, and fruit to be louely.
               Sometimes tender grifts from better tree she deriueth,
               And to a baser stock commits them for to be noorrisht.

                  Sometimes crumpled strings of thirsting roote she bewatreth,
               When raging dog-star burnt fruite-yard all to be scorcheth;
               And this is all her ioy, and herein stil she deliteth.
               As for Lady Venus, no such pastime she desireth,
               But walls her gardens, and orchyards warily wardeth,
               And mens sight shunneth, mens company dayly detesteth,
               Least by the rurall folk, violence might chaunce to be offred
               Vnto her owne sweeteself, or force and spoyle to her orchyard.

               Howmany thousand times did he turne himself to a reaper,
               And in a reapers weedes, bare sheaues of corne in a bundell,
               And when he so was dreast, each man would deeme him a reaper?
               How many thousand times did he change himself to a mower,
               And with long-toothd rake, with crookt sithe went to the meddowe,
               And when he thus made hay, each man tooke him for a mower?
               How many times did he then transforme himself to a ploweman,
               All in a leather pilch, with a goade in his hand, or a plowestaffe,
               And so shapte, each man would sweare that he were but a ploweman

               Yea how oft did he frame and shape himself as a gardner,
               Prest with a shredding hooke his vines and trees to be proyning,
               And so dight, no-man did doubt, but he was but a gardner?
               If that he met with a sweard, or a souldiers coate, or a cassock,
               Cassock, coate, and sweard did make him march as a souldier.
               And, when baits and hookes, and angling rods he receaued,
               Fishers and anglers so well, so right he resembled,
               That both Nymph and fish might well therewith be deceaued.
               So, and so did this Vertumnus, slippery turnecoate
               Turne, and winde, transforme, and change himself to a thousand
               Shapes; and all, to behold Pomona the Lady of apples.
               At last, with gray heares his wrinckled browes he bespreadeth,
               Putts on a red thrumbd hat, with a staffe goe's lasily hobling,
               Like to an old Beldame: and thus she begins to be tatling.
               O braue sweete apples, and ô most bewtiful orchyard,
               O paradise-garden, fit for so louely a gardner:
               And so giu's her a kisse; (too wanton a kisse for a Beldame.)
               
                  Then sits downe on a banck, and casteth her eyes to the garden
               Stoarde with trees, and tree's with fruitefull burden abounding.
               Ouer against this banck, where these two fate, was a goodly
               Elme, that leant herselfe, as a louing prop to a vine-tree,
               Vine-tree inclining, with clustred grapes, on her elme-tree.
               See, said th'old Beldame, to the sweete fac'te Lady of apples,
               See th
                     •
                   loued sight, and marke there, how many thousand
               Mutual imbracements, that vine-tree giu's to the elme-tree:
               Vine giu's grace to the elme, and elme giu's strength to the vine-tree,
               Either an others helpe, and either a ioy to an other.
               But yet alas, if th'elme stoode single alone fro the vine-tree,
               Or vine-tree be diuorct from her husbands company elmetree,
               Elme shuld haue nothing, but fruiteles leaues for a burden,
               Vine shuld lye on ground, which now mounts vp to the heauens,
               Then let Pomona example take by the vine-tree,
               Let Pomona loue, and ioyne herselfe to an elme-tree,
               Ioyne herselfe to a mate, or shew herselfe to be willing
               For to be ioynd to a mate. O how-many, how-many louers
               Should shee haue, if shee once shewd herself to be louing?
               Yea eu'n now (though now thou liue here sole in an orchyard,
               Sole in an orchyard here, and all inclosd as an anckresse)
               
                  Sileni, Fauni, Siluani, all the delightfull
               Crewe of rurall Gods, stil run to the Lady of apples.
               But thou (if thou wilt haue this thy match to be well made)
               Take heede, learne in time, and leand thine eare to a Beldame,
               Who, as a woman, must of right, wish well to a woman,
               And as an old woman, must needes know more then a damsell,
               Disdaine these Demy-gods, that rome and range by the deserts,
               Wood-gods, woodden gods, pide Pan, and filthy Priapus,
               
               And take Vertumnus to thy mate, who, more then a thousand
               
                  Sileni▪ Fauni, Siluani, dayly desires thee,
               And therefore (sith loue craues loue) more duly deseru's thee,
               And take mee for a pledge: for, I know, that nobody better
               Know's him then myself: his secreates all he reuealeth
               Vnto me, and in mee his surest trust he reposeth.
               And take this for a truth, Vertumnus goes not a gadding,
               Is not an out-come guest, but dwells hereby as a neighbour.
               Neither tak's he delite, his fancies dayly to alter,
               Or seeke for new loues, or choyce once made to be changing:
               Faithful Vertumnus loues with deuotion endles
               First loue and last loue, Pomona the Lady of apples:
               And can so con
                     •
                  orme, and frame himself to be pleasing,
               
                  That, what forme, or face, or shape Pomona desireth,
               Into the same himself Vertumnus speedily changeth.
               And, if like conceits are alwaies cause of a liking,
               You two loue and like with like affection, one thing.
               For, Pomona desires and loues faire plentiful orchyards,
               And Vertumnus takes first fruites of plentiful orchyards.
               And, though Vertumnus doe receaue these duetiful of
                     •
                  rings,
               And take in good part Pomonae's bewtiful apples,
               Plummes, and grapes, and hearbs, and flowres: yet he chiefly desireth
               Not those faire apples, but this faire Lady of apples,
               Not Pomonae's goods, but sweete Pomona the goddes,
               Not thine, but the alone. Therefore with mercy remember
               
                  Vertumnus torments, and thinke, that he mercy desireth
               With my mouth: thinke, that with these mine eyes he afordeth
               Teares: fea

                  e louely Venus, who wills each Nimph to be louely,
               Feare Nemesis, that plagues such girles, as loue to be loueles.
               Then she begins to recount many old wiues tales to the Lady,
               How that Anaxarete, for scorning bewtiful Iphis,
               
               Was transformd to a stone: with a thousand more: of a purpose
               For to procure her loue: and bade her looke to the fatall
               Fall of Anaxarete, and learne thereby to be louely;
               So might budding fruite from nipping frosts be defended,
               And halfe-ripe apples from blustring windes be protected.
               But sith th'old trott's shifts, and tales were lightly regarded,
               Turnecoate Vertumnus to a youth was speedily turned,
               Braue youth, gallant youth, as bright and sheene, as Apollo
               
               Seemes, when burning beames, which clouds had lately eclipsed,
               Haue their streaming light, and blazing bewty recou'red.
               Youthful Vertumnus to the chereful Lady aproached,
               And now offred force: but no force needes to be offred:
               Sweete face, and faire lookes, causd castles keyes to be yeelded.

                   the yeare: and is thus called of the Latine word, verto, which is, to turne, and Annus, signifying the yeare, as if a man would say, vertannus, the turning of the yeare. He is largely described and discoursed vpon by Propertius in the second Elegie of his fourth booke. Vertumnus at last, by turning himselfe to a youth, obteineth Pomona; that is, the spring comming on, the earth afordeth varietie of fruites and flowres. The like is that mariage of Zephyrus and Flora, celebrated by Ouid in the fifth booke of his Fasti. Vertumnus transformde to an old woman, goeth about to deceaue Pomona: it is good to abandon olde bawdes, which corrupt the mindes of tender girles.

                  Dieromena, hearing Syluia make mention of Iphis and Anaxarete, tooke occasion offered: and, by discouering her pride and plague, did thereby in
                     •
                  inuate the reuenging might of the seuere Lady Rhamnusia.

               Oftentimes he retir'de; yet loue stil forced him onward,

               Sometimes vnto the nurse his secreate smart he reuealeth,
               And by the milk, by the pap, by the blessed breast, he beseecheth.
               Sometimes vnto the friends of noble Dame he repaireth,
               And their helping hand with streaming teares he desireth.
               Sometimes wooing words in louing letter he writeth,
               And ten thousand times his lordlike Lady saluteth.
               Sometimes greene garlands with deaw of teares he bemoystneth▪
               
               And on posts and gates, his garlands watery fixeth.
               Sometimes tender side on threshold hard he reposeth,
               And there, locks and barres with curses vainly reuileth.
               Scorneful Anaxarete, with a frowning face, with a hard hart,

               Fayre-prowd, louely-cruell, til I also leaue to be liuing.
               With double darknes mine eyes shal at once be eclipsed,
               Of suns burning beames and light vntimely bereaued,
               And of Anaxarete's sweete sight vnkindly depriued.
               Neither needes any man these tidings for to be telling;
               
                  Iphis wilbe the newes, and Iphis wil be the bringer
               Of that selfsame newes: Iphis wil surely be present,
               And in presence dy: so Iphis shalbe reporter,
               So this Anaxarete in like sort shalbe beholder,
               And feede murdring sight with sight of murdered Iphis.
               
               Yet you gods (if mens affaires of gods be regarded,)
               Vouchsafe forlorne wretch with some smalle grace to remember;
               Let poore Iphis death, and cause of death be recorded:
               And by how much now his liuing dayes be abridged,
               Let, by somuch more his name and fame be prolonged.
               This said, brawne-falln armes, and eyes all watred, he lifted
               Vp to the posts, which earst with flowres he had often adorned,
               And there fastned a cord. These, these be the crowns, be the garlands,
               These be the flowres, which yeeld such pleasant sent to the scorneful
               Lady Anaxarete: so thrust in his head: yet he turned
               Head, and face, and eyes, eu'n at last gaspe, to the scorneful
               Lady Anaxarete: and there hangd woefuly tottring,
               With corde-strangled throate; his sprawling feete by the downefall
               Knockt her dore by chaunce; knockt dore did yeeld a resounding,
               Yeelded a mourneful sound, and made herself to be open,
               Wide open, to behold so strange and woeful an obiect.
               Dead dore, senceles dore, ten thousand times to be praised
               More then Anaxarete, who by no paines of a louer,

               And his poore mother with a sight so deadly presented,
               Old mother, childles mother, nay, now not a mother.
               Woeful woman, alas, clipt, kist, embraced her Iphis,
               
               Wept, cride out, hould, roard, performd al parts of a mother:

                  Brought through th'open streetes her sons dead corps in a coffin.
               Hard by the way, through which, this sad solemnity passed,
               Lady Anaxaretes braue bowre stoode loftily mounted:
               And, that dolefull sounde with mourning eccho redoobled
               Came to her eares at last (for now at last, the reuenging
               Goddes gan to requite) and forced her eyes to the windowe,
               For to behold and see poore Iphis laid in a coffin:
               Scarce she beheld and saw poore Iphis laid in a coffin,

                  ut that sightles sight was starck and stiffe on a sudden,
               And her purpled blood to a palenes speedily changed.
               Back she remou's her feete, her feete will not be remoued,
               Back she reflected her head, but her head would not be reflected;

               That same stone, which earst in her hard hart made his abiding,
               Dwelled in euery ioynt, and each where tooke vp a lodging

               In towne of Salamis, where famous Teucer abided,

               Stony Anaxarete, for a lasting signe of a stony
               Hart, stands fram'de of stone, in church of dame Cytheraea.
               
               Then let noble dames, let Ladies learne to be louely,
               And make more account of a gentle minde, then a gentry.
               Loue makes lowest high, and highest harts to be lowly,
               And by these meanes makes both highe and lowe to bee louely.
            
            
               THis reuenging goddes, qd 
                  Elpinus, was called Nemesis: she punished the insolencie of such, as in prosperitie bare themselues ouer arrogantly: especially those, who for their bewtie, were scornefull and disdainefull. She was also called Rhamnusia, of a place in Attica, where shee had a most sumptuous temple: and Adrastia, of one Adrastus, who was the first that euer did consecrate any temple vnto her. She was figured winged: for, punishment commeth quickly. She stoode on a wheele, and stearne of a ship: for she rolleth and ruleth all vpside downe. She held a bridle, and a rule or measure: for, we must temper our tongs, and deale iustly, as the Greke Epigramme expoundeth it.

                  ooner make an ende. The best is, I meane not to be so full of parables, as that Elpinus shall haue need to make any explication. I haue heard my mother many times in good sobrietie, make a long discourse of certayne schollers of Cambridge, who would needes finde out some way to mount vp to heauen, and vnderstand those mysteries which bee aboue the Moone. For this purpose they met together at Dawes cros
                     •
                  e: where, after long debating of the matter, it was resolued by the full consent of the learned assembly, that they should seeke and search, passe and repasse, from East to Weast, some by lande, some by sea, till they had found the way to heauen. O, it was a sweete sight, to beholde so many sageheads and gentle spirites thus vnited and assembled together. All being ready, they all made haste: some embarqued themselues, some traueled by land: others stayed in villages adioyning, expecting some heauenly apparition or reuelation from aboue. They that were in the ship, began to consult of their attempt; when, loe, on the sodayn, (such grace the heauens afforde to them that be heauenly affected) there came a straunger, yet an Aca
                        •
                     emique, vnto them: who perceauing that their resolution was, not to intermit their labour, till they had found the way how to goe to heauen aliue; toulde them, that peraduenture, himselfe could giue them best directions for that purpose: and that, if they would giue him the hearing, hee would discourse at large, both what himselfe was, and how diuers of his companions had attempted the like voyage, and what had befallen them in the same. They all thanked him, for his vnexpected courtesie; willed him to enter into the ship, and with this discourse helpe them to forget the daunger and yrksomenes of their trauel: which done, he thus began.
               I was borne and bred fiue miles beyond S. Michaels mount, foure summers before the greene winter: Saturne was predominant at my natiuity; my father, a man of prouidence, perceauing my terrestriall disposition, would needes haue me admitted a scholler in the Vniuersitie, called the Garden, whereof we all were named Gardiners: Our Conuocation house was a Harbor sytuate directly vnder the Arctike pole, where, euery new Moone, my selfe and my fellow Gardiners assembled together, and sang such compositions as we had seuerally framed of the vertue of hearbs, the pleasaunt liquor of the vine, the 
                     •
                  weetnes of fruits, the profite of husbandry, and dressing of Gardens and Orchyards: in such sort that our Vniuersity became famous, by reason of diuers learned monuments, daylie there deuised, and thence proceeding, to the publike profit of the common wealth, as, The vulgar Dioscorides, The Garden of Ladies, The moralization of the Georgikes, with many such wonderous workes. And as our selues

were delighted in dressing and keeping of Gardens, so did we choose vs distinct names &amp; additions of seueral hearbs accordingly: so that one was called a Violet, an other a Thistle, this Lettuce, that Succorie; the rest, either Borage, Hmlock, Pasnip, Cowslip, Rosemary, or some like. But so it fell out on a day, as we were thus busied in our Harbour, we heard of a reporte scattered abroad, that a general deluge and inundation of waters should happen that yeare, as was foretolde by some idle Prognosticators. This straunge newes troubled the whole countrey; and, among others, vs poore Gardiners: who, hauing read this lewd Almanack, and considering the florishing discourses of these Astrologicall doctors (which threatned the Vines, Gardens, and Orchyards, with blasts, frosts, caterpillers, and a thousand such phantastical dangers) layd our heads together, and dealt, as I am about to tell you. First we offered sacrifice to Bacchus and Priapus, and then concluded, to send some of our Vniuersity as ambassadours to heauen: who by this one iourney, might doe a double seruice: the one, in seeing whether these tale-tell Astrologers had any ground for their predictions; the other in obtaining grace &amp; mercie of the Gods, by graunting plen
                     •
                  y &amp; abundāce. Among others, Succhory, a pleasant &amp; mery cō
                  panion, had this conceipt in his head, to get vp to heauen. It were good, me thinks, qd he, to finde out a great &amp; mightie Egle, so strong, that some two of vs might mount on his back, &amp; he beare vs vp to the skies: Mary, we had need to look, that these 2 be not too heauy, or ouer-fat &amp; corpulent, lest the Egle be ouercharged. Therefore the Fennel, and the Violet, in my fancy, be the fittest for this purpose, as being deft and nimble fellowes, and as light as may be. Nay, sayd Cowslip, there is no reason at all to vse the help of an Egle in this matter, because you know that Iupiter himselfe was once transformed into an Egle, and caried vp to heauen an other kinde of burden, thē 
                  Fennell or Violet. Then out stept Hemlock, with his fryse bonnet, and sayd, that he had sound a better and more compendious way to heauen, then that. It were not amisse, qd he, if we had a cart; because the iourney is long: and, the ambassadours may by this meanes trauel with greater ease and facilitie. Besides this, they may therein conuey to Olympus, some of the best fruites of our Gardens, to present the Gods withal when they come thither. The graue aduice of this fore-casting Academike, was generally wel liked of: sauing that they could not conceaue, who should draw the Cart: and therefore this inuention, the more pitie, came also to nothing. All the Academike Gardiners deuised and mused much, how it might be brought to passe. Some remembring Lucians ship, thought it best to goe by water: Others, rather by land, through some great forrest, as Dante did: at last, they all agreed, that the surest way was, to make ladders of the poles that bare vp their hoppes, and by the meanes thereof, to builde and rayse vp a towre that should ouer-looke the whole worlde: and so might

they in short time pierce the clowdes: and by certaine engynes still draw vp new stuffe to increase the height of their fortification, if occasion were. The towre begun, and halfe ended (
                     •
                  or many hands make light worke) wee made choyce of three, the most expert men in all our Vniuersitie, in Astrologie, Mathematikes, and Philosophie; to weete, Hemlocke, Pasnip, and the Thistle, to be ambassadors. These three gathered diuers fruites, Raysons, and hearbs, to present the Lordes and Ladies of heauen withall, and to request diuers boones in the behalfe of our Vniuersitie. So we brought and accompanied them with great ioy, euen vnto the Ladders, &amp; saw them mount vp chearefuly. Hemlock was one Damoetas, of the Deareles parck, Fac-totū indeclinabile to the Lady of the Lake. Pasnip was a braue peece of a man, about foure and thirty yeares olde, fayre, streight, and vpright, so nimble and light, that he might well haue walked on the edge of a sworde, or poynt of a speare. The Thistle was more auncient, as hauing passed full fortie yeares, and was wholly addicted to contemplation.
               After much mounting, when the learned Thistle was almost at the first heauen, he began to obserue and marke, whether Strabo, Ptolomaeus, and other measurers of the world, had made a good suruey thereof. He viewed the toppe of the mount Parnassus, where Lactantius and Plutarchus apointed the limites of the deluge; and perceauing that from thence, it was a thousand thousand myles vp to heauen, hee laughed at their follie, and made a mock of Berosus, who would needes finde out the centre of the earth, by the Arke of Noah. Thus iesting at their ignorance, and hauing his head full of Cosmographicall Proclamations, he began to discourse to his companions, of the situation and distance of kingdomes, mountaines, seas, riuers, &amp; woods, of the eleuation of the Poles, the rising of the stars, &amp; the names of euery prouince, with their lawes, statutes, customes, and different kinds of discipline. He shewed new-found worlds, neuer known to Africa, Europe, or Asia. He made Aristotle an asse, who neuer thought that al the Zone vnder the Zodiake was habitable. With these &amp; the like speculations and sweete sightes, they passed the time, and continued further on their iourney. And further let them continue a while, sayd the ruler of the company that came from Dawes crosse, in the mean time, whilst your Gardiners are mounting vp to heauen, let vs learne of you, what became of the fearful prediction of those Astrological masters. Content, qd the straū
                  ger, &amp; thus it fell out. When these famous Astrologers with their nūbers, poynts, measures, Astrolabes, signes, &amp; instruments had concluded for certaine, that this inundation should ensue, which would ouerflow &amp; drown the whole world, so that not one person should escape aliue, publishing this their conceit abroad, by printing of their Almanacks and Prognostications,

shewing from day to day, in the houses of great men and palaces of princes, the signes, the eclipses of the moone, the coniunction of the planets, and other such fantasies, portending, as they sayd, this future inundation; they made euery man feare, and many run vp to hills, that, if they must needes dye, they might die last, and see others drownd before. Among the rest, the Prior of Saint Bartholomews, remoued from London to Harrow hill, and there bestowed an hundred markes, in fortifiyng and furnishing himselfe agaynst the flood. And now the time was at hand, when all should come to naught: When (I know not by what reuolution or influence) the ayre on the sodaine began to be black, clowds to lowre, and rayne to powre downe so fast, that euery man verily beleeued, the astrologicall predictions would prooue true in the ende, sith they seemed so likely in the beginning. This made men, women, and children, tag and rag, to climbe vp to trees, to the tops of houses, castles, and steeples, to saue their liues. All the world being thus on an vprore, there came an odde Astronomer, peraduenture hauing lesse learning, but surely more wit then the others, who seeing, what a pitifull howling and lamentation was made on euery side, began with bitter words and vehemencie of speech to inueigh agaynst the former Astrologers, saying, they were seditious fellowes, worthy to be clapt by the heeles, and that all was starke false which they had put downe to the terror of the poore people, who of all other deaths were most vnwilling to be choakte with water. This new doctor was for his labour, accompted a foole of wise and foole: for, still as hee thus preached, it rayned still. At last, about two or three houres after, as God would, the ayre began to cleare vp, the rayne ceased, the storme was past, and all was well agayne. Then came foorth the amased people, from trees, rocks, and Castles, distracted betweene hope and feare, scarce resolued whether themselues were dead or aliue, as if they had come from the new-found worlde, or out of Trophonius den: and by degrees comming to their former sence and witte, made great feasts and bonfires, for ioy that they had escaped a daunger which neuer hangd ouer their heads. The Astronomer that gaue out this comfortable contradiction, seeing that all fell out according to his speech (although peraduenture himselfe thought as the rest did) bare himselfe loftily, was made a doctor, and dubbed a knight for learning, which was neuer in his head: and the rest were scorned for fooles, which had published the contrary Prognostications. Shortly after this, the first Astrologers, seeing themselues fouly ouerseene, and that this other doctor, by some Seraphical instinct, had foretolde the trueth, came vnto him, reuerēced him as a Demy-God, &amp; desired him to imparte vnto them, the ground of this his knowledge, and conceipt: which done, they would acknowledge him for their onely master and

Capten in all their Astrological speculations. What ground, qd he? Mary▪ the surest ground, I assure you. For, are you such sottes, to imagin, that in this my prediction, I had regard to any astrological diuination, and not rather to a most sure and vnfallible consequence of reason, better then a thousand obseruations of signes and constellations? If this your vniuersall deluge had happened, my grand masters and doctors, who would then haue beene left aliue, to prooue me a lyer, all the world being drowned? If it happened not, (as in trueth it so falleth out) I was sure of the generall applause of the people, for this my plausible Prognostication. All the Congregatio sapientum laughed hereat: And now, (qd the chiefe of their company) it is like that your fellow Gardners, are almost at heauen by this; therefore, continue your discourse, as they, I hope, haue continued their iourney. With a good will, qd the stranger, and thus it came to passe. My fellowes at last came to a fayre and playne clowde, which tutched the very top of their tabernacle, thinking they had beene at their iourneies end, and that it had been an easie matter, to haue dispatched the rest on foote: but they missed their ma
                     •
                  ke, and came short of their account, which troubled them not a litle. And as they stoode thus consulting with themselues, how they might safely passe further, beholde, there came on a sodayne, a man and a woman, riding on a litle clowde, as though it had beene a courser: who saluted them courteously, and bade them welcome; demaunding what they sought for, in so high a place, where it was very difficult to mount vp further, and more daungerous to goe downe agayne. We are Academikes, 
                  qd 
                  Pasnip, and being of late troubled and perplexed with the repugnant conceipts of Astrologers, and menaced and threatned with their vnhappy predictions, haue traueled hither of purpose to vnderstand whether their diuinations be true or not: and if, as they say, the Gods haue determined to plague vs, and our gardens with sterilitie and inundations, then haue we diuers petitions to be preferred to the immortal Gods, on the behalfe of our selues and our Orchyards: which being once perused, and accordingly considered by their diuine Maiesties, wee haue brought with vs such simple fruites, as our poore abilitie could afforde, to present their coelestiall Deities withall. It is a straunge thing, sayd the man on the clowde, to see you here so high: but what contradiction finde you among your Astrologers? Me thinks you presume very much, in daring to reprehend great clerkes, and mount vp to the skies, your selues being but Gardiners and ignorant men. Though we be Gardiners, qd the Thistle, yet let not that be preiudicial vnto vs: for my selfe am a doctor of Astrologie, &amp; can yeeld you an accompt of the opinions of the Chaldees, Aegyptians, Indians, Mores, Arabians, Iewes, Grecians, Romaynes, modernes &amp; ancients whatsoeuer: al whose conceipts I finde as variable as the moone, &amp; themselues altogether Lunatike▪ Before I make aunswere hereunto, qd the man

that rode on the clowde, I will tell you my name: I am called Intellectus, vnderstanding, and this my sister is named Fantasie, or Opinion. Our duty and function is, to guide and conduct to heauen, all such persons as here ariue, but not as you haue aryued: though indeede, by reason of the small number of them that mount vp hither, we are not so pestred with busines, but that we haue leasure enough to conferre with you. Well then, my friends, you must know, that there be diuers wayes here, all which will bring you to one and the same ende. True it is, that there is one way, through which very few passe; because they see so many strange and most myraculous apparitions, that when they returne agayne to their companions below on the earth, they can meete with nothing there, to the which they may fully compare or resemble those heauenly myracles, when they seeke to make reporte thereof to their friends, or other company, desirous of their coelestiall newes. And in trueth, for any one that commeth hither with a commendable desire, to reforme the disorders of mans life, there be fiue thousand, that ambitiously are driuen forward by a foolish curiositie.
               When wee brought hither Plato, Aristotle, Proclus, Auerrois, and others that haue discoursed of the heauens, wee conducted them by such a way, that they saw but eight Sphaeres: Albertus magnus, I sake, and many others were guided through an other passage, and found out nine Sphaeres; and thus haue they euer from time to time, repugned their fellowes conceipts. Without doubt, qd 
                  Hemlock, I beleeue it is, as you say: for, so among vs below, if a man aske how many miles it is from Tugford to Tasley; seauen sayth one, eight sayth another; nay, so many men, so many different numbers of miles: insomuch, that hee which would indeede know the trueth, had neede to bring a line with him, and measure the miles himselfe.
               These aspiring wittes, quoth Intellectus, when they are thus eleuated, roame and wander about the incomprehensible quantity of the heauens, without my companie, and frame of their owne inuention, fiue hundred fooleries and monstrous imaginations in the heauens. Here they paynt a Bull, there a Dogge, here a Goate, there a Lyon, and such like, as beares, horses, and fishes: whereupon well might the Philosopher Bi

Incontinently, the clowde was eleuated vp to Olympus: and no sooner had they ariued in heauen, but Venus and Ganymedes (as women and children vse to doe) ran to them to see their flowers and fruites. Pasnip seeing Venus holde out her apron to receaue some of their prouision, gaue her leaue to take her choyce. Then came Lady Luna, who also tooke what shee would, and presently departed, as being inioyned euery day twice, to cause a flowing and reflowing in the Indian and Persian sea: besides a thousand other matters, wherewith she is euer occupied. Ganymedes was as busie about Hemlocke, who there so liberally bestowed the remnant of their fruites, that in the ende nothing remayne

                  Iupiter seeing these strangers aryued in heauen, in habite of ambassadors, bade them draw neare, himself then sitting in counsayle. Where, the iolly proloquutor Hemlock, in the name of the rest, began a braue oration▪ &amp; when he came to the poynt to vse these words: Loe here, the present which Priapus, the God of our earthly Gardēs, hath sent to your coelestial Maiesties: he foūd nothing at all left in his pannyers. Iupiter moued hereat, whould heare him no further; but catching him and Pasnip by the hayre of the head, threw them downe from heauen, to their Gardens on earth agayne: With this transformation, that they should both thencefoorth haue the forme and nature of that roote, and weede, whereof they bare the names. The Thistle being all this while in heauen, and perceauing how rygorously his fellowes were handled; scratched off all his tender haire from his head, for very griefe and anguish; so that it neuer after grew vp so firmly agayne, but that euery yeare once (for a memoriall of this admyrable accident) euerie little blast of winde blewe it all about the fieldes and Gardens.
               Thus perplexed, heeintreates Intellectus, and humbly besecheth him, that he would not forsake him in this extremitie. Intellectus pitying his wofull plight, excused him to the Gods, giuing them to vnderstand, that hee had neither in worde nor deede offended their diuine Maiestie.

Wherefore Iupiter, Phoebus, and Mercurie gaue him this prerogatiue and preheminence, that he might assigne new names to his nephews and succeeding posteritie, as Artichauks, and such like; which should euer after be had in great estimation among other fruites of the Garden, and serued at mighty mens tables as a dish of great dayntines and delicacie: and afterward gaue Intellectus leaue to leade him all about heauen; and to peruse his petitions, that his Patent might be sealed accordingly. As the Thistle was about to view the heauens; Stay, qd 
                  Intellectus, thou must first obtayne the good will of Time; who must also haue a sight of these thy demaundes: therefore reade them, and let me heare what they are.

               INprimis, that Hemlock neuer grow in Gardens; but onely in ditches and such like obscure and vnpleasant places, fitte for so vnsauorie and loathsome a weede.
               Item, That none vnder the degree of an Esquire, haue his bed stuft with the downe of a thistle.
               Item, That whosoeuer eateth buttered Pasnips without pepper, may dye without Auricular confession.
               Item, That no man, vnles he may dispend foure nobles by the yeare in good free-holde, shall breake his fast with an Artychauck pye.
               Item, That none aboue the age of seuen yeares, if he nettle his hande, shall be ridde of his payne by rubbing the place with a Dock, and saying, In Docke, out Nettle.
               Item, That if any maried man vse any nosegay, wherein the flowers be odde in number, he may stand in daunger of Acteons penaltie.
               Item, That whosoeuer drinketh Claret wine without Borage, or Sack without a sprig of Rosemary, may neuer be ridde of his Rheume by drinking Muscadell before he goe to bed.
               Item, That if a man be like to haue a Feuer quartane, for want of a figge, the master of the Garden, by the aduise of two Phisitians, may giue him leaue to pluck and eate.
               Item, That: Nay, qd 
                  Intellectus, no more Thats; for, this is too much already. These fooleries must not be any part of thy petition: thou shalt onely demaund a good stomack and taste, to the ende, that euery thing may be to thy good content and liking.
               So they passed on, towards the auncient pallace of Time. Time was a great man out of all measure, shewing a kinde of maiestie in his forehead. His face had three seuerall semblances: his browe and eyes resembling middle age; his mouth and cheekes, youth: his beard, olde age. He had before him three great glasses, looking now in one, now in an other: and,

according to that which he saw in them, he framed his countenance: sometimes ioyeus and mery, sometimes graue and moderate, sometimes sad and heauy. On his left side, was Weeping; on his right side, Laughing. His garment was of such a color, as the Thistle could not possibly discerne it, although, as hee tolde mee, hee marked it seriously, neither knew hee how to tearme it. He sawe about him an infinite nūber of se

In meane time, for a conclusion of this dayes exercise (sith it, seemed

conuenient to end with him, with whome they began) Amarillis and Cassiopaea sang these verses, which Amyntas liuing had made of the death of Phillis: which ended, they all departed.
