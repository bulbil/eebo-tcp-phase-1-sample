            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

And as for the orationOracy it selse which as it is most learned / so is it most elegant / to what purpose shoulde I make any wordes of it / seīge it praiseth it selfe ynough / &amp; sence good wyne nedeth no tauerne busshe / to vttre it. But yet in this oration who so ever thou arte most gentill read: thou shalte / 

beside other maters / see it notably &amp; learnedly handled / of what importaunce and how invincible the power and excellencie of Goddes truthe is: which as it maye now and than be pressed of enemies / so it can not possiblie be oppressed after suche sorte / but it commeth agayne at leynght behinde the scriene / more glorious and more welcome. Thou shalt see also / touchinge obediēce / that it is subiecte to truthe / and what is to be iudged true obedience. Besides this / of mennes tradicions / which for the most parte are vtterly repugnaunt against the truthe of Goddes lawe. And ther by the waye / he speaketh of the kinges said highnesses mariage / which / by the rype iudgement antoritie and priuilege of the most and principall vniuersities of the worlde / and than with the consent of the hole churche of Englande / he contracted with the most cleare and most noble Lady / Quene Anne.
            After that touching the Kinges Maiesties title / as perteynyng to the supreme headde of the churche of Englande.
            Lastly of all / of the false pretensed supremacie of the Bishop of Rome / in the realme of Englande / most iustly abrogated: and how all other bishoppes / being felowe like to him in

their function / yea and in som poyntes aboue him within their owne Provinces / were befor tyme bounde to him by their othe. But be thou most surely persuaded of this / good reader / that ye bishop of Rome / though ther were no cause elles but this mariage / will easyly cō

            It is an olde saide sawe: Marie Magdalene ꝓfited vs lesse in her quycke belefe that Christ was risen / than Thomas that was longer in doubt. A man maye rightly call him Fabius / that with his advysed taking of leasure / restored the mater. Albeit I speake not this as though Winchestre had not boulted out this ca se secretly with him selfe before hande (for he
                  
                     〈◊〉

mater out of the darke / although of it selfe it was sounde ynough / but by reason of sondry opiniones / it was lapped vp and made darke / &amp; than did he debate it wittyly to and fro / and so at last (after long and great deliberatiou had in the mater) because ther is no better coūsailourCoūsel lour. than leasure and tyme / he wolde resolutely wt his learned and consummate iudgement confirme it. Thou shouldest / gentill reader / esteme his censure and authoritie to be of the more weightye credēce / in asmuche as the mater was not rashely / and at all advētures / but with iudgement (as thou seest) and with wisedome examined and discussed. And this is no newe example / to be agaīst the bisshop of Rome / seīg that not only this man / but many men many ty mes / yea &amp; right great learned men / afore now have done the same / even iu writinges / wherin they bothe paynted him out in his colours / and made his sleightes / falsehead / fraudes / and deceiptfull wylés / openly knowne to the world. Therfore if thou at any tyme heretofore have doubted either of true obediēce / or of ye kinges maiesties mariage / or title / either elles of ye B.Marya ge. of Romes false pretensed supremacie / as if tho

Which Paule openyng that playnly vnto Titus / which he speaketh here generallye / commaunded him / to warne al men / to obeie their Princes. And ther be other men appoynted also of God / to require obedience / howbeit in an inferiour ordre. For the wife beinge in subieccion to her husbande / the seruant to the maister / and to whom so euer any mā is in subieccion / they must also obey their gouernours for Goddes sake.

                principally to be obeyde.
            
               As for example: The maister biddeth the ser uaunt doo a thinge / and the kinge commaundeth him to do a cleane contrary thinge / and bo the at one tyme / and in one moment.
            And forasmuche as they ought bothe to be obei de for goddes sake / by the worde of God / the very nature of thinges / can not admitte / bothe their commaundementes / to be applied in at al one selfe same time / and of al one selfe same mā here in like as it might perchaunce be doubted of som mā that hatheth not yet his wittes / mu che exercised / whether of them the seruaunt is bounden chiefly and most principally to obey / euen so vnto him / that marketh wel other like causes / the solucion of suche a question shall anon playnly appeare / that nature it self frameth the mater so / that ye inferiours must also serve and geve place to the superiours.
            Therfore in this propoūdeth example / the ser vaunt must not obey his maister / but the kinge / as his superiour mayster / as him / whom bothe / the maister and servaunt are bounden to obeye.
            And for asmuche as we acknowlage / that ther is one above bothe the servaunt / maister / and Kinge / even God / whiche is the Kinge of Kī ges and Lorde of Lordes / of whom al thinges /

            Therfore is the wife praised that obeyeth her husbande / yea / vnto deathe. For it is better to obey God than men.
            Thus in asmuche as it is manifest / yt an ordre ought to be kept in obedience / and that our due tie is to obey euery one chiefly / after such sorte / as he excelleth other in ordre and prerogatyve by the testimonie of Goddes lawe: I thinke it

            Wherin surely I see no cause / why any man shoulde be offended / that the kinge is called the headde of churche of Englande / rather than the headde of the realme of Englande.

But Paule taught not so / which sayde / that ye autoritie of maistres ouer their seruaūtes sholde not be chaūged or dyminished through pro fessing of Christ / but warned them to kepe it still in perfite autoritie / bidding servaūtes / to be obedient vnto their bodily maisters for goddes sake. The conuerting of a wife vnto faithe / withdraweth nothing from thautoritie ofCol. iij her husbande / for he is the headde of the wife / still / and because she / after she had professed ye faithe / shoulde shewe no token of mysordre / wherby she might plucke the mȳdes of som frō religion / Saint Petres mīde was / that wives having professed the faithe / shoulde leave of ye office of preachīg / which they executed by wor des / and winne (without ye worde) their hus bandes through their chaste conversacion.

               hede to your selues, and to the hole flocke, amōge whom the holy goost hathe set you to be ouerseers, to gouerne the churche of God, whom he hathe purchaced, with his owne bloude. And lest we shoulde passe ouer any thīg / although it is mēt to an other purpose / 

let vs not omitte that / that Petre speaketh / concernīge ye Royall priesthode. For this texte: Whatso euer thou shal bynde in earthe &amp;c. perteyneth to an other mater / and this: Fede my shepe: besides that / that Christ spake wt his owne mouthe / meaneth no more / but that I haue allready shewed / was commaunded / cō cerning the gouernement of the churche. These sentēces and suche like / though they be vnderstonden / as those mē wolde haue them / that is / that Bishopes &amp; ministres of the worde of God in the churche / are nothing against the kinges autoritie (but that he maye be called ye headde of the churche) no more / than the obediēce due to yt kinge / is any thīge nypped or diminyshed / in yt / that ye wife is cōmaunded to obey her hus bande / &amp; yt seruaūt his maister / as it were wt ge nerall speache of wordes. Forlike as wt the lawers / as they thē selues terme it / ther be now &amp; than sondry iurisdicciones yt ꝓcede out of al one thinge / &amp; yet they marre not one an other: but they cōsiste &amp; cōcurre by ye mutual helpe of one to an other: euē so in yt the gouernement of the churche is cōmitted to ye apostles / &amp; to those yt succede in their rowmes / maye not be thought to abrogate or diminishe yt / that God hathe cō
               mitted vnto prīces / in any cōdiciō. The person / 

vicare or ye parishe priestes cure of his parisheners / is neuer ye lesse / because the bishop ought also to ouersee: nether maye ye Bishoppes iurisdiccion be demed of nō effecte / because he must take ye Archebishoppe for his superiour. For ye curate / ye bishop &amp; tharchebishoppe do gouerne ye churche euery one in their degree &amp; ordre.
            Thā like as euery one of thē doing their office / seme not to hīdre one an other / but to helpe one an other / euenso / in ye we finde / ye gouernemēt of the churche was cōmitted to ye apostles / &amp; to those yt succede in their rowme / yt wc beforehāde is cōmitted of God to prīces / is in no wise taken awaye. But forasmuche as gouernemēt hathe nede of many thinges / especially teachīg &amp; preeminēce occording to ye sondry distribuciō of giftes / vnto som / God hathe committed the office of teachīg / &amp; ye ministerie of ye sacramētes in all one bodye / &amp; to som preeminence / not to be aduersaries / but as diuerse membres agree in one body / so in gouernemēt they shoude accorde together / &amp; euery one goo abouth is owne office wt charitie. But here me thinke / I heare som mē startle / &amp; as it were / wōdrous earnestly chide / because I had rather vse a newe makīge of distīcciō, thā yt olde accustumed Hū trū distīc ciō, wc as those mē thīke / dothe put a hādesom

differēce betwene the gouernemētes of a Prince / and of the churche: that is / that the Prince shoulde gouerne in temporall maters / and the churche in spirituall: after the whiche distinction / the Prince / as the moone which is called the lesse light / shoulde haue charge of suche ma ters / as are of the night / but the other / which be of the spirite &amp; of the daye light / he must re serue to the sonne alone / to be discussed. Forsothe a blynde distincciō / and full of darkenes. For if thou leave vnto a christian Prince the na me of a kinge still / so that his duetye is / not only to be the chief ouer the people / in Goddes stede / but also to gouerne them / and rule them:

This Ezechias therfore / the scripture commendeth so highly / that ther was non of all the Kinges of Iuda / which obserued all the lordes preceptes like vnto him. For his will was to seke the lorde with all his hole hearte / as he did in dede and pros pered / as the scripture testifieth. 
                  〈◊〉
               . Par. xxviij. What did this Ezechias / I saye? In the very

furst yeare &amp; furst moneth of his reigne / he did not only buylde vp the gates of the lordes house agayne / but also gave diligence to refourme the priestes them selues / and to repaire the lyuely buylding / that was decayed. For he not only admonished yt priestes / yt dwelt together on the east strete of the citie / of their necligēce in their office / but also like a man of autoritie / sayde: Hearken o ye Leuites and priestes: be ye sanctified and make cleane the house of the Lorde, the God of your fathers, &amp; put a waye all vncleānes frō the sayntuarie. &amp;c. I pray you / what coulde he speake more impe riously? For he spake not / as one / that exhorted thē / as inferiours / or those that be folowe like / vse to take in them selves with all / to cau se the communicacion of the mater / to be the more easily taken. Which maner of talke is re quisite som time in a gentill godly hearte in an others mānes cause. And if Ezechias lusted to haue spoken after that rate / he wolde not have sayde / Be ye santified / but let vs be santified: not make you cleane, but let vs make cleane: not put ye awaye, but let vs put awaye: or if the mater had ben suche / that it wolde not admitte feloweship / if a priuate man shoulde hawished or declared those cases / it had become

him nether to make him selfe felowe like with the mater to be required / to exhorte them / nor to require it by the waye of commaundemēt.
            But the right good prince Ezechias / beinge taught of God / what his Regall office / charge and administracion was / vsed suche maner tal ke vnto the priestes / as shoulde declare yt autori tie and power of the speaker. Therfore he spea keth in the imperatiue mode: Hearken, make cleane, and put awaye. And the priestes them selues (as it appeareth in the same place) did / as yt kinge had iustly bidden them / and obeyed his commaundement. Thus were those kingesGod wilbe angry ī these daies

formost ranke. Whom he knewe / to be of better courage in faithe / to breake the more daungerous raye of thenemies / because they were not tangled nor letted with any charge of worldly maters / and might by their example of constaunce / encourāge / allure / and provoke other of the weaker sorte / to become souldiours of yt bande also. In which kinde of warrefarre / though Christ / makīg choise of his owne / gaue the vppermost standing to Petre / among the brotherne / it was no marvaill: seinge he had so armed him / yt he knewe before hande / though he wolde geve backe from the enemye perhappes for a tyme / yet he wolde not geve it ouer so / but to it agayne stotaly / and fight like a tall felowe for the defense of the truthe. Ha / was Petre the chief than? No man saithe naye. For he confessed Christ / to be the very sonne of the lyvyng God / furst. And Petre was of as constaunt and stedfast myndes / in defending of the same truthe / at all tymes / as any mā was. He was the furst after Christ / that taught the Iewes. And ī thassemblye of thapostles / whā one shoulde nedes speake in all their names / Petre / somtyme as the mater required / was chief in the tale telling. Therfore I will not saye naye to the argument / which they call:

               Argumentum à coniugatis, but that Saint Petre / beīge by so many wayes and reasones / the furst / might also be thought to be chief among thapostles. For like as the wise man hathe wisedome / in that he is a wise man: so hathe the chief mā ye chief place or supremacie. What than? he yt is chief of all ye Phisicianes / hathe not he also the supremacie among Phisicianes? For why shoulde he not? Among Paynters also / if ther were any in these dayes / as connyng as Appelles or Pharrhasius was / and were called therfore ye head Paynter / wolde we not saye / that he had the supremacie amōg paynters? yea doubtles. In vniuersities / agayn / if it were agreed by all

                of Parrise / as being a vniuer sitie most playnteously furnished and occupied with great learned men / shoulde be called the headde vniuersitie of the worlde / might not ye name of supremacie be fitte for it / being chief among other vniuersities / yes doubtles. But let vs come nerer to the mater. If a man / whan he had set one man to gouerne the hole householde / wherin inasmuche as he had a great forte of yong men / whom he wolde fayne haue taught and instructed in good artes / and wolde provide many scholeruaisters / and among

other / ther were one man excellently wel learned aboue the rest / whom / as a notable man among other / he wolde call the chief of all the scholemaisters that he had gotten: and to whose instruccion he wolde committe / those that he setteth most by: hathe not he / seing he is chief scholemaister / the supremacie? yes. For the chief person can not chose / but haue chief rule in any mater: For these two wordes / Primus, which is furst / principall / or chief / &amp; Primatus, which is chief rule / preeminence / and is here rightly englished / supremacie / are coniugata, that is to saye / lynked to gether / the one depen ding of the other / not only in speache / but also in mater. Neuertheles this question maye be asked: he / of whom I spake / ye chief scholemaister in this householde / if ther shoulde fall any controuersie / touching maners / or ordre / whether of their autoritics shoulde be estemed aboue the other / his / vnto whom the householde was committed / or his / that is callad to instrue te the youthe? he that is called the chief / as I saide / and therfore he hathe the supremacie. Who doubteth / but his rowme is the greater / that hathe charge of the householde? why so? For it stōdeth most with reason / because ordre is somtyme chaunged by relacion. And that / 

which in one relacion is supreme and chief / in an other or in a cōtrary relaciō / hathe 
                  〈◊〉
                an inferiour place / and often tymes the lowest place of all. And so God ye sonne / is equal with the father / after his divinitie / but he is lesse thā the father / after is humanitie.
            Also God the sonne / in that he is God / is in ye begynnyng / and is the begynnyng it selse: but in that he is the sonne of God / he is the seconde person in nombre: 
                  〈◊〉
                without all consideracion of tyme / he is without begynnyng as God the father is. But to fette examples / out inferiour maters: Do we not fee all one man to vse diuerse offices at home / like Arithmeticall figu res / now to occupie the furst and chief rowme / than the seconde / afterwarde the thrid / &amp; somtyme a lower rowme / as the cause / wherin he is occupied / and place / wher company meteth / doo require? Doo we not see him / that sitteth highest amōg iudges / and for that cause / is called / the chief iudge / whan he is required / to be present in extraordinarie iudgementes / as it is often sene / placed after others in the thrid or fourthe rowme? But in divine offices / I pray you / how great a supremacie as I maye to call it / hathe the chappelayne ouer his maister / as long as he is in divine ministracion? And 
                  〈◊〉
               
               
whan he is out of the place / and cast of his gaire / he leaveth his supremacie behynde him.
            And it is no marvail. For in this cace / the mater stondeth so / that who so mindeth to reteyne the name of the chief person &amp; chief office still / must not swarve from the thinge / whervnto ye nvme was applyed and setto. Therfore to returne vnto examples. Admitte / ther were a fa mous chief Phisician / that is to saye / were as conning in Phisike as any man / and so / because the mater so requireth it / he kepeth still / his preeminence / yea Sir / but while he meddleth with Phisike: But forasmuche as ther is an other maner of office in the administracion of ye common weale / let him be contēt also with his seconde forme / &amp; stryve not to beare rule ouer other / because he is the chief Phisician: nether let him take autortie vpon him to be a cōmaunder of the rest of the Phisicianes / which is not geuen him in his preeminence / not because he coulde not geue it hī / which so preferred him / but because it was not his pleasur to geue it hī for it was no reason why he shoulde: or elles which is the sorest thinge to speake of all / why he did not: Mary Sir / because he made him not absolutely chief / but he called him the chief Phisician.

Let the vniuersitie of Parrise reioyce not so muche of the honour of the name / as to studie to make it good / that it attributed by the name. Finaly let this scholemaister / which is called to teache children / because the good man of the house thought not the person of the mā / but the vertue hidden vnder the person / whorthye the honour of chief scholemaister / remembre and remembre again / that he is not honoured / but burthened with ye name / and let him study rather according to ye the intēt of the name / to shewe him selfe chief / in the office of teaching / than to abuse the vayne title of a name / and as though he were chief absolutely without condicion / yet neclecting his office / and so losing his supremacie / to contende and stryve / about the name and terme of it / with them / that as being set in autoritie to gouerne the householde / haue the true and absolute supremacie in dede: and to myngle Goddes maters / and the worldes maters together / so that he maye ouercome / by right or by wrōg / and haue it as him lusteth: as for his function &amp;

Howbeit the name of a seruaūte / signifieth a seruice.

And forasmuche as we see that dayly chaunce / in sondry kindes of craftesmen / &amp; in euery trifling mater: it is no marvaill / though it be so in religion / wherin / all men wishe / that all thinges were ordred / according to the most perfite example / wherin for all that / many men partly distrust their owne wittes / partly vse currupte wittes / in that / they esteme straūge ware more than domesticall stuf: no man ought / I saye / to thinke it any marvaill / though the glorions name of the churche of Rome / beinge at that tyme famous in excellent vertue / drawing and alluring almost all the partes of the worlde / in to admiracion of it / for vertues sake / which is the most sure bonde / knyt all men to it / and cau sed that churche / whom al men might see so notably vertuous / to be reverenced / as the chief &amp; principall churche among other. And Godly mē beautified it also with those names / wc ye Ro mishe bishoppes make boast of to the worlde / as though they were set furthe by oracle from God / to the supremacie withall / not the supremacie of vertue / but the supremacie of power / and that earthly / an externe &amp; a fleshly power / such a one as Christ neuer exercised / nor committed it at any tyme to any

Wher is fidelitie? What maye a man beleve now a dayes? Whō maye a man trust? ffor he was made a bishop and by the priuilege of the Bishop of Rome / admitted in to the ordre of Bishoppes / and consecrated by his commaundement / and sworne vpon the

holy euangelistes to defende the rightes of the churche of Rome: all which thinges he willīgly and with al his hearte obeyde / and permised to performe. So / saye they / euen the very selfe same man / to the most horrible example of breache of his fidelitie / and forgotting the solemne othe / he made / or if not through forgotefulnes / yet (which is the worse of the twoo) having contemned and defied his othe and fidelitie / he professeth him selfe an open enemye of the chur che of Rome / and to shote his poysoned shaftes the more surely agaist it / he boroweth a pece of artillary as it were of obedience / and thinketh he lyeth closely in covert / as though his sides were ouerhilled / whan for all that / he lyeth open and naked to al menues sightes / bothe like a fole and a naughty man.

And for the more cleare demonstracion of this mater / I take this to be the most fitte example. A certain maried

man / whan he thought by most iust likelyhodes / that his furst wife had bē vndoubtedly deadde: as a man that had bē free from mariage / by the autoritie of the churche / toke another woman / which was a faire damoysell / &amp;An exā
                  ple / fatched not farre of. thought to be a mayde / to wife by cōsent of her parentes: by whō / after they had dwelt a fewe yeares together / and he had childrē by her: Lo / his former wife vnloked for / came againe / as it were peeping behinde the post. Well / she requireth to haue her husbande agayn / that had done evil in marieng an other woman. Than ye man being astonyed at that / as a mater allmost incredible / and dryven at the furst to denie her to be his wife: than to aske her what tokēs she coulde tell him / and last of all / because he was wonderous lothe to be divorced from her / that he had maried the later / to make as longe delayes as he coulde: and at leinght to cal her to the lawe / &amp; ther to make al the shifte he coulde / to defende his seconde wifes cause. But whan he was cast / he gaue place to the truthe / and taketh his furst wife to him agayn by the iudgement of the churche. In this cace now / if the woman / that he maried last be iustely put frō him / or for sorowe and heavines speakig neuer a worde / her Parentes or frendes wolde crye

out: Out vpon mennes maners? out vpon it / what a worlde is this? &amp; after this sorte wolde make suche a like wondremcnt / as these mē seme to vse against me: thow helhounde / thou wicked couenaunt breaker / doest thou forsake and cast of this woman now / vnto whom thou madest ones so faithfull a promise in the open face of the churche / whan God him selfe was a present witnesse? hast thou forgotē the wordes which thou spakest in the temple / the ministre of God rehearsing them vnto the / in the presences of so many people / this woman / yt thou hast now shamefully cast vp / being present / &amp; making covenaunt &amp; promise to the in like sorte agayne? Diddest not thou ones desire vs for her / and madest muche entreatie to haue her to thy wife / and promisedest vs vpon thy othe / yt thou woldcst vse her as the good wife of thy house for euer / and neuer to forsake her during thy lyfe? Arte thou not ashamed / seig thou hast suche children by her / to cast her of now / as though she were an whore? and now whan thou leavest her to take her parte / that caused the to be divorced frō her? Wher is the keping of othes become? wher is fidelitie? what maye a man beleve now a dayes? whom maye a mā trust? The husbande forsaketh the wife.
            
               Which maner of communictcion / as it maye be borne withall in the womans heavynes / bothe for the great grief of her present calamitie / and because she is the weaker vessell / euen so whan it is spoken of other mennes mouthes / which wolde haue folkes to thike / they speake pithily / it wolde make men thinke / they were starke foles / and in open company / euery body wolde laughe at them / and in triall of lawe noman couldc abyde them. But after a certain space / if a man wolde answer yr womau: and saye: woman you doo not well to accuse him / that you want now to be your husbande and defendour: For what faulte fynde you now in him? For as longe as the farther wife helde her awaye / he loved you / he honoured you / he vsed you as his wife: yea so muche / that whā the furst wife came agayne / whō he thought had ben deadde / he was not rashe in geuing credence vnto her / nor sodaynly assented vnto her: he coulde doo no more for your sake / than he did. If he had fallen to whores / and so forsaken you / your querell had ben somwhat. But now / what cast you him in ye tethe / with faithe breaking / which to kepe his faithe / departed from you / and kept him to that other wife / that he had laufully maried before? Why doo you complayne still? the

woman / I wene / wolde geue ouer: in dede she had no cause to complayne. Yf she had not bē a mayden / as she was takē for / but an evill dispo sed womā / &amp; had occasioned this mānes first wi fe / to be sent in to some ferre ylondes / to haue this mā to her husbāde in ye meane tyme / &amp; cauSaye youtrue doo you loue chaūge of women / as he did? sed ye furst mariage to be brokē: whether shoulde be thought to be more in the faulte? this mā / yt maried (as he thought) rightly / were in no faulte: and the subtyll womā werein yt greatest faulte / as one yt delighted to haue an other wo mās husbande.
