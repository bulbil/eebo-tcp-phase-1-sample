            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            THE AVTHOR TO HIS
Poeme.
            
               TRace the wide ſtage of ſpight and proud diſdaine,
               And mount the ſteps of ſcornefull enuies ſtaire,
               Imperfect embrion of an idle braine,
               Soare not aloft, vſe meane, do not deſpaire,
               The beſt way is betweene the ſea and ayre:
               Be like thy ſelfe, be neither proud nor baſe,
               One enuy gets, the other gaynes diſgrace.
            
            
               Be not too huge in ſhew, in ſtrength a childe,
               Theſe imateriall Epithites eſchew,
               Be to the ſcornfull proud, the humble milde,
               Put not thy cenſure to an open view,
               Speech enuy oft, but Silence neuer knew.
               When thou ſeeſt good then prayſe, when bad be blinde,
               Then wit will beare with thee, and fooles be kinde.
            
         
         
            
            To the Reader.
            
               I Which in ſilence neſt ſo many dayes
               Smoothered the ſlight of my vnfeathered quill,
               Becauſe I knew it could not merit prayſe,
               Here where the Muſes ſang and ſhewd their skill,
               For this did ſeeme to be Parnaſtus hill:
               But this amaz'd my minde, and grieu'd mine eye
               To ſee the Buzards with the Eagles flye.
            
            
               To ſee a troupe of Souldiers neuer tride,
               Beſiege a fort by nature fenc'd on high,
               I was aſham'd to ſee the heires of pride,
               Debaſe in vnexperienc'd Poetry,
               The immortall vertues of great Maieſtie,
               I theſe are they that do the Muſes ſtaine,
               One wanton pen makes all be iudged vaine.
            
            
               I which ſecurely on theſe errours gaz'd,
               And ſafely ſtood vpon the ſilent ſhore,
               When others Ships by enuies rockes were craz'd,
               Loue me conſtrain'd, as pride did them before,
               To truſt the rockes and leaue the ſilent ſhore:
               The loue of friends, not prayſe did me perſwade,
               Againſt my will, against the ſtreames to wade.
            
            
               Therefore to you whoſe iudgement is ſincere,
               If any fault, as many faults there be,
               Seeme harſh and iarring to a tuned eare,
               Impute the blame to thoſe, and not to me,
               Who made my pen ſhew his infirmitie:
               If any good as ſmall there is you ſee,
               Reape you the profit, yeeld but thankes to me.

               SItting with Clio by the gliding Thame,
                  Deſcription of Fortune.
               
               neere to her ſiluer girt the verdant ſtrand,
               I ſaw Rhamuſis ſo adornd by fame:
               Dauncing in meaſures, on the farther ſand,
               Holding a Ball of gold within her hand:
               She ſtood on that, that neuer ſtood but went,
               So muſt all thoſe that truſt her gouernment.
            
            
               Then did this Queene, her wandring coach aſcend,
               Whoſe wheeles were more inconſtant then the winde,
               A mighty troope this Empreſſe did attend,
               There might you Caius Marius caruing find,
               And martiall Scylla courting Venus kind:
               Times alter, and in times we changed bee,
               Chaunce onely conſtant is in leuitie.
            
            
               There might you ſee how Archimedes art,Geometry
               
               As a ſtrong bulwarke guarded Syracuſe:
               
               How Scipio fought and Cato ſtabd his hart,
               How Anthony did wrong the ſacred muſe,
               And Cleopatras body did abuſe.
               How Mago fell in Spaine, and Hanniball
               
               Did pitch his tents before Saturnias wall.
            
            
               
               His ſtratagems, his ſnares, vnequall fightes,
               Scipio, Sempronius, and Flaminius ſlaine:
               
               
                  Aemilius dead amidſt his wounded knights,
               How chance his youth with praiſe did entertaine,
               And in his age how Fortune wrought this paine:
               All this ſhee did, oh man her fraude perceiue,
               And truſt her not, for ſhee will thee deceiue.
            
            
               How Alexander roſe at Darius fall,
               
                  Lyſimachus within the Lyons den:
               How Scypio did beſiedge Numantias wall,
               And many thouſands more which ſcape my pen,
               Amongſt this fatall troope of Fortunes men:
               I ſaw an aged king except I erre,
               That cleaped was the high Cadwallader.

               One hand a ſtaffe, the other held a booke,
               On which his eyes continually did looke.

               The warres of England for the crowne of France,
               
               There many battels with their mournfull chance.
            
            
               The ciuill warres of Yorke and Lancaſter,
               
               The Cambrian helmet changde for Englands crowne:
               How true diſcent did Tudors blood preferre,
               The brow of peace diſpearced Mars his frowne,The helmet was the ancient creſt of the Teudors.
               
               The land of warre is rulde by iuſtice gowne.
               Theſe ſhall haue end, then ſhall ariſe a King
               Which plenty ſhall conduct, in concords ſtring.
            
            
               
               He with vnnumbred linkes of reaſons chaine,
               Shall three in one, and one in three vnite:
               
                  Britaine ſhould be the name, for Brute doth raigne,
               A King commands no Princes fauorite,
               This he intreates, for this his penne doth write:
               Ceaſe to command, learne ſubiects to obay,
               Reaſon where iuſtice rules, beares greateſt ſway.
            
            
               Is it not peerleſſe praiſe with peace to gaine,
               That for the which, our fathers ſpent their blood:
               And neuer age but ours could reobtaine?
               O happy men if that you ſaw ſuch good,
               But will is masked ſtill with errors hood.
               Let ture obeiſans vp this diet breake,

               The fect was this, the propheſie was ſuch
               Which he had read with carefull induſtry,
               And quoted euery line with iudgments touch,
               A midſt his ſtudy caſting vp his eye,
               Seeing his miſtreſſe Fortune was not nye.
               His booke he ſleightly ſet into his gowne,
               Which on the yellow ſand fell quickly downe.
            
            
               Thence poſted he on his maieſtique Aſſe,
               Like ſome ſlow rider pacing to the race:
               Than Iſis ſiluer channell did I paſſe,
               And thither went, where as mine eyes might gaze
               On that faire booke, clad in a golden caſe.
               I paſt the Annales, for it pleaſde mine eye,
               To muſe vpon that ſacred propheſie.
            
            
               
               When I had read vnto the latter lyne,
               I ſaw the aged king returne with ſpeede?
               Kind Syr (quoth he) ſaw you a booke of mine?
               I Syr (quoth I) if this be he indeed
               I gaue it him; he gaue me thankes for meed.
               He poſted thence, I to my ſtudy went,
               Where on this matter many houres I ſpent.
            
            
               At laſt I was reſolu'd for to relate
               In Poetry the things mine eyes did ſee:
               Which was the vncertainety of humane ſtate,
               To paint the things a right with equitie,
               I did implore the ayde of memorie.

                  Maugre ſweete, not reuenge, my lines loue peace,
               Doe not my ſhame before thou ſeeſt it tell:
               Marke euery line, and each wordes nature ſpell.
               Ere thou beginſt to reade, looke, beare in minde
               Of whom I write, yea how, and in what kind.

               Their warres, their ſpoiles, their fightes and victory,
               Their filthy vices, with their vertues rare:
               Their laud, diſpraiſe, their praiſe and infamy,
               Their conqueſts triumphes with their treachery.
               Then doth our muſe declare inteſtine warres,

                  Long ſmothred Enuy doth the Army guide,
                  Which made firme loue from true obedience ſlide:
                  'T was that great Neuill made proud George rebell,
                  Whoſe haughty ſpirits Warwicke knew too well.
               
               
                  
                  
                     Warwicke that raiſde the race of Mortimer,
                  
                  Whoſe eyes did ſee too ſoone, thy death ſaies ſo:
                  The downfall of immortall Lancaſter,
                  
                  'T was he that did, what could not Warwicke doo?
                  Make Kings and Queenes to loue and feare him too.
                  'T was that great Peere, who with one warlike hand,
                  Crown'd and vncrown'd two kings who rulde the land.
               
               
                  Thus while theſe Royall but diſloyall Peeres,
                  Maugre reuenge to him that knew not feare,
                  Vnnumbred bands of men and ſwarmes appeares
                  In North and South, Eaſt, Weſt, yea euery where
                  They throw away their Coats, and Corſlets weare.
                  Wiues, maides, and Orphants eyes are ſtuft with teares,
                  And cannot ſee the Spades tranſform'd to Speares.
               
               
                  The Shepheards hooke is made a ſouldiers pike,
                  Whoſe weather-beaten hands muſt learne aright
                  His ſpeare to traile, and with his ſword to ſtrike
                  Vpon the plumed beauer of a knight,
                  None muſt be ſparde by warres impartiall might.
                  If euery ſouldier were a King, what then?
                  Princes ſhould die as faſt as other men.
               
               
                  The Senator muſt leaue his skarlet gowne,
                  And keepe him in ſome Turret of defence:
                  When warres once flouriſh, Iuſtice muſt goe downe,
                  Lawes to correct, is lawleſſe warres pretence,
                  Valure doth greeue to ſee ill gotten pence.
                  To ſee a man without deſerts to riſe,
                  Makes warre ſuch men, not Iuſtice to deſpiſe.
               
               
                  
                  You that in peace by vſe of golden hoords
                  Your dunghill race to Barons did erect:
                  You that by Engliſh phraſe and choſen woords
                  Make heauens enuy your topleſle Architeck,
                  Your Angels cannot you from warres protect.
                  The Campe and Court in manners different are,
                  Words may in Peace, but deeds preuaile in Warre.
               
               
                  For Robes of honor furr'd with Miniuere
                  You muſt haue breſt-plates of well tempred ſteele,
                  And on your aged heads ſtrong Helmets weare,
                  All ſtates muſt turne when Fortune turnes her wheele,
                  That man which pleaſure taſtes muſt ſorrow feele.
                  Who ſees the wracke of mightie Empery,
                  He loues his life too well that will not dye.
               
               
                  When Kings muſt fight, ſhall ſubiects liue in peace?
                  What Coward is of ſuch a crauant race,
                  That loues not honor more than idle eaſe?
                  Great Romane I applaud thy worthy Phraſe,
                  To liue with ſhame, is worſe then dye with praiſe.
                  All which haue being, alwaies cannot bee,
                  For things corrupt muſt die, and ſo muſt wee.
               
               
                  Could Creſſus mightie mines from Cyrus hand,
                  His captiue carkaſſe or his ſtate defend?
                  Wealth cannot warre, nor ſiluer ſpeares withſtand:
                  By ſtrife we ſee the greateſt ſtates haue end,
                  And moſt they marre by warre, who moſt would mend.
                  When old warres ceaſe, then ſtraight their ſprings anew,
                  For harmes ſtill harmes, and euils do ills enſue.
               
               
                  
                  No ſooner had the gladſome eyes of peace
                  Beheld this warlike ſea inuiron'd Ile,
                  But diſobedience heire to ſluggiſh eaſe,
                  Did weake beleefe ſubdue with ſubtile ſtile,
                  Grace winnes the heart, but words the eares beguile.
                  Twas Warwicks tongue, whoſe ſpeech did all men pleaſe
                  Whoſe words were ſuch, or very like to theſe.
               
            
            
               The Earle of Warwicks ſpeech.
               
                  YOu know great Lords, your very eyes did ſee
                  The ſpotleſſe honor which my houſe and I
                  Did euer beare this kingdome; who but wee
                  Did checke the pride of wilfull tyranny:
                  And with our Grandſires we eſteemde it good,
                  For Englands weale to ſpill our deareſt blood.
               
               
                  Witneſſe the diſmall fall of Salisbury
                  
                  And Richard Duke of Yorke in Wakefield ſlaine,
                  The wracke of my decaied familie,
                  Why did we this, what profit did we gaine?
                  Twas but to ſhew our country our good will,
                  Which now we alſo do, and euer will.
               
               
                  How many times haue I in complete ſteele
                  Yea mounted on my ſteed purſude the chaſe?
                  Witneſſe theſe weary limbes, for age muſt feele,
                  If youth hath runn'd aſtray or tedious race.
                  Witneſſe theſe ſiluer haires which now appeares,
                  Cares makes vs old, though we be yong in yeares.
               
               
                  
                  When as theſe eyes, impartiall eyes of mine,
                  Beheld my king illuded and miſled
                  By baſer men, true honor did repine
                  To ſee great maieſtie with baſeneſſe wed:
                  For which I waged warre, and warring wan,
                  And winning, choſe a Tyger for a Lambe.
               
               
                  Both you and I great Lords, yea all the ſtate
                  With vniuerſall voice adiudg'd him wiſe:
                  Who now hath prou'd a tyrant and vngrate,
                  Humilitie makes time obſeruers riſe.
                  For you I choſe him king and ſpent my blood,
                  But tryall ſaies, good ſeeming is no good,
               
               
                  Now therefore friends let Warwicks tongue intreate,
                  Since that our hopes of Edwards loue diſpaire,
                  That Lancaſter may repoſſeſſe his ſeate,
                  Whom we vnkindly thruſt from honors chaire,
                  The reaſon is which gouernes our pretents,
                  Tyrants are worſer farre then Innocents.
               
               
                  Thus this enraged Lord doth inſtigate
                  With ſpurlike words ſwift courſers to the race:
                  Enuy ambition breeds, ambition hate:
                  Hate diſcontent breeds, diſcontent diſgrace,
                  Theſe be warres angry ſounds, pernitious race.
                  Theſe vices by Iniuſtice nouriſht are,
                  Affection in a Iudge is worſe then warre.
               
               
                  
                  Bleſſed that ſtate, thrice happie is the land
                  VVhere ſacred Iuſtice is eſteemde diuine:
                  And where the Iudge on one eare holds his hand,
                  My pen applaudes that ſentence iuſt of thine,
                  
                     Romes holy Prince, peace louing Antonine,
                  
                  As I am Marcus, I am not thy foe,
                  But being Iudge, I muſt be iuſt alſo.
               
               
                  That lawe deryding Peere, diſdaining Lord,
                  
                     Warwick doth his rebellious Enſignes reare:
                  And vowes reuenge on Edward with his ſword,
                  
                     Haſtings and Stanley do withſtand the Beare,
                  True honor neuer yeelds to ſeruile feare.
                  He is a friend that loues when Fate doth frowne,
                  He ſhall haue thouſands that doth weare a Crowne.
               
               
                  Thus while theſe threatnings like ſome blazing ſtarre,
                  The wracke of ſome great Emperour do portend:
                  Their friends on either ſide addreſſe for warre,
                  Great William Earle of Pembrooke doth entend,
                  Ere warre begin to make of warre an end.
                  And for that purpoſe for his friends he ſent,
                  To whom as thus he ſhewed his right intent.
               
            
            
               The Earle of Pembrookes Oration.
               
                  YOu that did euer with your ſwords maintaine,
                  The vndoubted title of the whiter Roſe:
                  By whoſe great ayde great Edward did obtaine,
                  The Royall crowne and homage held of thoſe,
                  VVhich now rebell, deere friends correct this ſinne,
                  'Tis as much praiſe to keepe, as praiſe to winne.
               
               
                  
                  If ſpeech might ſpur you to this glorious race,
                  Where endleſſe honor is the purchaſt fee:
                  Selected words my ruder ſpeech ſhould grace,
                  We pricke in vaine his ſides whoſe feete are free.
                  You euer did the houſe of Yorke adore,
                  True loue encreaſeth daily more and more.
               
               
                  Giue not occaſion to the enuious pen,
                  To brand you with the badge of infamie:
                  Be firme in reſolution worthy men,
                  And thinke vpon your auncient libertie.
                  Behold why Warwicke doth theſe warres entend,
                  A bad beginning hath a worſer end.
               
               
                  Looke with indifferent, not reſpecting eyes,
                  Vpon theſe two coriualls in the warre:
                  
                     Edward a King, couragious, honeſt, wiſe,
                  
                     Warwicke whoſe name is like a blazing ſtarre,
                  That ſome enſuing harmes doth foretell,
                  Enuy doth ſtill worke ill, but neuer well.
               
               
                  For whom doth he this bloody battell wage?
                  For aged Henry, and the Prince his ſonne:
                  Who but for him had led a quiet age,
                  But they poore Princes, were by him vndone.
                  I finde it true which hath bene often ſed,
                  Beares muſt ſometime with humane fleſh be fed.
               
               
                  
                  It is not loue to either of theſe twaine,
                  That doth enforce this proud ignoble Peere:
                  Theſe wandring troupes of rebells to maintaine,
                  But tis ambition whom he holds moſt deere,
                  That doth compell his willing hands to fight:
                  Vnſetled braines bloud ſtill reſpect, not right.
               
               
                  Nay, what if Henry ſhould enioy the wreath,
                  Thinke you by yeelding fauour to enioy?
                  Friends, when warres riſe ſay kings ſhould neuer breath,
                  Princes in neede men of regard imploy.
                  To this iuſt action loyall friends be mou'd,
                  The firmeſt faith in danger great is prou'd.
               
               
                  THus hath this Lord as with a touch-ſtone tride,
                  The courage of his countrey-men and loue:
                  The voyce of all is on warres, warres they cride,
                  The Princes vertues do the ſubiectes moue,
                  Dangers and perils eminent to proue.
                  The noble Earle with ſpeede purſues his fate,
                  Delay brings danger to the ſureſt ſtate.
               
               
                  When Fame reported this to Edwards care,
                  Hope vanquiſht feare and gaue encouragement:
                  To ſee them firme who euer faithfull were.
                  Then to Lord Stafford, Southwike Earle he ſent,
                  To muſter all his friends incontinent:
                  Then gaue he ioynt commiſsion to theſe twaine,
                  As equalles when they came in Campe to raigne.
               
               
                  
                  Thus theſe two Captaines as thoſe two of yore,
                  VVhen Romes ſelected youth in Cannas bled,
                  Equall in power, but not in Iudgements ſtore,
                  As Varro, Stafford from the battell fled,
                  As Paulus, ſo renowmed Pembrooke ſped.
                  Thus Lord-like ſtout Aemilius forth doth goe,
                  To chaſe the pride of his rebellious foe.
               
               
                  
                     Stafford and hee weake ſtaffe to leane vpon,
                  No Stafford he, nor ſprung from Buckingham,
                  
                  Nor let that name ſo baſe a man bemoane,
                  His cowardize eſcandalizde his fame.
                  Laſſiuious luſt did explaiten his ſhame.
                  Theſe two to Banbary with Armies bend,
                  Thence Stafford fled, there Herberts life did end.
               
               
                  There might you ſee a troope of warlike men,
                  Conducted by the glories of their Clyme:
                  Vnworthy I, with my vnworthy pen,
                  To aeternize in Layes vndecent Rime,
                  Their memories, which liue in ſpight of time.
                  Theſe two as Fabius and Marcellus weare,
                  
                     Romes guarding target and offending ſpeare.
               
               
                  
                     Richard was valorous, but his brother wiſe,

                  There might you ſee, O I am greeu'd to ſay,

                     Richard with his victorious ſword in hand,
                  Like a fierce Lyon paſſing from his den,
                  Or ſome ſterne Boare, whoſe anger plowes the land,
                  Securely paſſe through euery conquer'd band.
                  As a round bullet from a Canon ſent,
                  This Knight alone through fortie thouſand went.
               
               
                  And backe return'd to his amazed traine,
                  But more enraged with anger then before:
                  Begins to kill, where he before had ſlaine,
                  Like a cloſe myzer he augments his ſtore,
                  The more he ſlaies, to ſlaie he loues the more.
                  All this thou didſt, what latter age can tell,
                  Of one that better did, or halfe ſo well.

                  Till like to ſheepe they fled in order rude.

                  They ſold their liues for liues ere they were dead,
                  Their conquering blood their honors did emblaze,

                  But men borne baſe, a baſer word will ſay,

                  A ſtarre on earth, more bright than ſtarre can bee.
               
               
                  
                  To whom ſhall I this Northerne ſtarre compare▪
                  
                  To Caeſar which did firſt ſubdue the ſtate:
                  To Horſus who no limbe of Chriſt did ſpare,
                  Damming his ſoule this land to ruinate,
                  Great Williams conqueſt and the Normanes hate.
                  Thus doth my Muſe all wanting art begin,
                  To ſing thy vertues, and to ſhewe their ſin.
               
               
                  
                     Caeſar was twice repulſt ere he could ſee
                  This litle world from all the world remote:
                  Before we ſawe thy face we ſent to thee,
                  As to a Pilot for to guide our boate:
                  Which did in Seas of ſuddaine ſorrow floate.
                  He loſt his ſword before he conqueſt wan,
                  We yeeld thee all our hearts, and all we can.
               
               
                  
                     Horſus by cruell tyrant trechery,
                  Subdude Ambroſius that wiſe Prince of peace:
                  Witneſſe the hidden kniues at Salisbury,
                  
                  He trauaile brought, but thou doeſt bring vs eaſe,
                  Thy true deſcent makes greedy warres to ceaſe.
                  A Wolfe poſſeſt his heart, a Lyon thine,
                  He worſe then man, thou better more diuine.
               
               
                  
                     William was fierce in warre, and ſo art thou:
                  In counſell ſage, thou doeſt him aequalize:
                  His ſword forc't foes their trembling knees to bowe,
                  Thou conquerſt hearts, by thy hearts winning eyes
                  By force he wan, by merits thou doeſt riſe.
                  He brought ſubiection, thou doeſt freedome bring.
                  He loued warre, but thou of peace art King.
               
               
                  
                  
                     Rufus was rude, thou ciuill, gentle, kinde:
                  He was auſtere, thy browes hath mercies frowne:
                  He had a Neros hart, thou Caeſars minde:
                  He hunting lou'd, for pleaſure tumbled downe
                  Many a Caſtle fayre, and ſtately Towne:
                  Thou lou'ſt the chaſe, yet Cities doeſt adorne,
                  Thou wert for all the worlds great profit borne,
               
               
                  
                     Henry was grac't with artes, thou doeſt excell:
                  Children did bleſſe his age but ſoone did dye:
                  Children thou haſt in health and perfect well,
                  (God proſper them with pure proſperitie,)
                  Adorne their harts with louing pietie:
                  He was a worthy King, thou worthier farre,
                  Thou art our Northerne-Pole, harts-guiding ſtarre.
               
               
                  Soare humble thoughts, and let my abiect pen
                  Touch the high mounted Artike Northerne ſtarre,
                  And there compare this man excelling men:
                  VVe ſhould compare the things that equall are,
                  And who is like this light, this lampe, this ſtarre?
                  Mine eyes diſtill ſweete teares, the teares of ioy,
                  To ſee Troyes iſſue raigne in new found Troy.
                  
               
               
                  Let Barland ceaſe to write of wiſeſt Kings,
                  And Mellificius with his tuned voyce,
                  From whoſe ſweet tong ſprang learnings ſweeteſt ſprings?
                  Sing not of Perſians prayſe, or Caldeans ioyes,
                  The Grecians Emperour, Europs worthieſt choyce.
                  Theſe three combinde, each ſought the others fall,
                  
                     Britaine is ioynd, and Concord guides it all.
               
               
                  When Alexander ſawe that precious ſtone,
                  Vnder whoſe Iſye wings Achilles lay,
                  Shedding ambitious teares, he ſaid with mone,
                  
                     
Vnhappy I, and ten tunes happy they,
                  Whoſe enſignes prayſe, ſweet Homer did diſplay:
                  Then happy art thou King, whoſe raigne wee ſee
                  
                     Homer doth ſing thy prayſe, for thou art hee.
               
               
                  The Maieſtie of Marius fearefull face
                  Did terrifie the Cymbrians crauen minde:
                  Though he were armde with Clothos fatall mace,
                  And ſolemne oath to murther did him binde,
                  A wandring Bucke did feare the Eagles kinde:
                  So did thy Princely lookes and grace of God
                  Protect thy iſſue from a Traytors rod.
               
               
                  Now doth my Ship in plenties Ocean ſayle,
                  Puſht with a pleaſant gale of pleaſures winde:
                  But ſtay I here an enuious Momiſt rayle,
                  Thy toothleſſe threate doth not amaze my minde,
                  Barke, for thou canſt not bite, I ſcorne thy kinde,
                  That which I write, I reade, and both are true,
                  I dare not, nor I will not tell what will enſue.
               
               
                  My hope is good that we ſhall happy bee,
                  Hopeleſſe our foes, they feare, we ſtill ſecure:
                  We peace, they warre: Ye endleſſe peace ſhall ſee,
                  We plenty haue, they pouerty endure,
                  Religion we ſincere, but they impure.
                  They liuing ſeeme to dye, we dying gaine
                  To liue with Saints in Paradiſus plaine.
               
               
                  What ſaid the learned, thoſe that learning loue,
                  If cauſes periſh, then effects decay,
                  Pray for the cauſe, yea, pray to God aboue
                  That he may long the Albion Scepter ſway,
                  Who ſhinde like Sol in our Cimmerian day.
                  Liue, and liue long, great King, liue many dayes,
                  
                     Vſe that fayre Theame, Be as thou art alwayes.

               THe ſecond time doth my unworthy muſe
               Salute thy milde aſpect thriſe noble Knight,
               Let gracious cenſure his defects peruſe,
               Whoſe Genius waites on thy heroicke ſpright,
               Whoſe loue and life are bent to honour thee:
               And whileſt breath laſteth vſe both them and mee.
            
            
               Theſe Poems which my infant labours ſend
               As meſſengers of dutie to thine eares,
               Are of ſmall value, but if nature lend
               Some perfect dayes to my unripened yeares,
               My pen ſhall vſe a more iudicious vaine,
               And ſing thy glory in a higher ſtraine.
            
            
               Your Honours

            TO THE IVDICIOVS
Reader.
            
               I Which in bloudy warres haue ſleep'd my pen,
               Whoſe Muſe the paſſing bell of peace did wring,
               And how the world did looſe a world of men,
               Now chuſe to touch a more concordant ſtring,
               My Prince his prayſe, whoſe prayſe Ile euer ſing.
               Tis no mechanicke hope of hired gaine
               That mou'd my minde theſe labours to ſuſtaine.
            
            
               No, that ignoble baſeneſſe I abiure,
               It was the loue I euer bare the place
               Where firſt I breathed life did me allure,
               In pleaſant paines for to conſume a ſpace,
               And her to prayſe, though with mine owne diſgrace:
               With my diſgrace, why? though my verſe be ill,
               I do not doubt to pleaſe the good with will.
            
            
               To thee Iudicious Reader do I ſend
               Theſe fruites of youth, tis thee I hope to pleaſe:
               If that my muſe the ignorant offend,
               No lines of mine their fury ſhall appeaſe,
               I ſet iuſt warre before an vniuſt peace,
               I rayle not I, though I with Plato ſay,
               To pleaſe the wiſe, muſt bee the wiſeſt way.
            
            
               
               THe lotted ſeruant to rhy Infant age,
               Thrice glorious iſſue of a gracious King,
               Leaſt that her twelue-monthes fearefull tapynage,
               Ingratitude ſuſpect to thee ſhould bring,
               Me, though vnworthy, choſe thy prayſe to ſing
               Her mourning garments ſhe hath caſt aſide,
               And hopes ere long to entertaine her Bride.
            
            
               The Cleargie with the Barons borrowed light,
               Is now obſcured by thy tranſplendant ſhine:
               The Rochet nor the Border hath no right
               To rule, but that which doth from thee decline,
               She ioyes and glories to be onely thine:
               Shee deemes it honour, count it no diſpraiſe
               For thee with her to ſpend thy yonger dayes.
            
            
               No matchles Machauil, nor Arietine,
               
               Doth her plaine meaning breaſt with enuy breede,
               Her wits do moderne ſeeme, and not diuine,
               Loyall her loue though lowly is her weede,
               A ſympathie there is of word and deede:
               Such as theſe are, in Wales thine eyes ſhall ſee,
               Thouſands that will both liue and dye with thee.
            
            
               O was ſhe euer falſe, vntrue, vnkinde?
               Since her obedience did augment thy ſtile?
               Or ſince the parted Roſes were combinde,
               Did euer rebels blood her breſt defile?
               Or did ſhe euer Englands hopes beguile?
               Witneſſe the world, and thoſe that liue therein,
               Her ſpotleſſe ſoule did neuer taſte that ſin.
            
            
               
               Search Truthes Records, not times illuding lines,
               Then ſhall thy Princely thoughts and eyes be fed
               With the ſtrange wonders of thoſe warlike times,
               When thy great Grandſyres made our channels red
               With blood of thoſe that on our ſhoares laie dead.
               Teaching great Caeſar how to runne away,
               That neuer knew to ſlye before that day.
            
            
               Ten yeares did Rome and all the world admire,
               For all the world and Rome ten yeares did feare
               The luſture of thy Bekons ſet on fire,
               Great Odoniſis King, Character,
               
               Whoſe endleſſe worth my worthleſſe Muſe ſhall reare
               To that bright Spheare where honor doth remaine,
               She loues thee dead, thy life her loue did gaine.
            
            
               VVhat honor or what glory didſt thou win
               VVith the earthes ſtrength to conquer but an Ile,
               Maiſter of the worlds miſtres, mightie King?
               Only this grac'd the greatnes of thy ſtile,
               
                  Claudius with blood did not his hands defile.
               This triumph Rome did thee as highly grace,
               As when by Scipio Affrique conquered was.
            
            
               How many Legions Caeſar didſt thou ſend?
               How many Conſuls did returne of thine,
               VVhich ſought what others marr'd, by warres to mend?
               How many Emperours Britaine did repine,
               To ſee thy honor riſe, their praiſe decline.
               Let Tacitus vnto the world declare,
               No land ſaue Rome might with this land compare.
            
            
               
               I know yong Prince, and am agreeu'd to ſee
               The leeuy'd lookes of ſquint-cyde Theonyn:
               
               Who ſaies this ſault is proper vnto mee,
               To iudge all others baſe our ſelues diuine,
               No enuious Momiſt tis no fault of mine:
               That ſeme are ſo, I muſt confeſſe tis true,
               All are not bad of vs, nor good of you.
            
            
               The mellow fields haue tares as well as corne,
               And thiſtles grow amidſt the greeneſt graſſe:
               An Anacharſe in Tartary was borne,
               Vertue and vice do meete in euery place,
               
                  Clodius in Rome as well as Milo was.
               Both good and bad in euery land we ſee,
               And ſo are you, if of a land ye bee.
            
            
               Curbe the malignant pride of enuies rage,
               And checke the ſtubborne ſtomackes of diſdaine,
               Theſe penny Poets of our brazen ſtage
               Which alwayes wiſh, O let them wiſh in vaine,
               VVith Roſſius gate thy gouernment to ſtaine,
               Make them more milde, or be thou more auſtere,
               Tis veretue, vnto vice to be ſeuere.
            
            
               I ſpeake not this vnto the learned wiſe,
               For them I loue, becauſe the truth they loue:
               Tis the bleard iudgement of ſeditious eyes,
               That doth my muſe and my affection moue,
               A moſt vnwilling Satiriſt to proue:
               Nature hath made me milde, but theſe hard men
               Turn'd my ſoft quill into a brazen pen.
            
            
               
               Play not the Satyr peace affecting muſe,
               I doubt not but their conſcience will prouoke
               Theſe Luciliſts their follies to refuſe,
               And make them ſoft, though they were hard as oke,
               Conſcience makes bad men good, ſo wiſe men ſpoke
               I leaue them to their ſpurres, my muſe ſhall flye
               Vnto that Sphere where enuy dares not prye.
            
            
               Vnto that Sphere whoſe circuit doth containe
               The neuer ſpotted eſſence of his ſoule,
               Whoſe ſacred intellect no worldly ſtaine
               Could with deſires rebelling aide controule:
               This guilded Sphere is like a golden boule,
               Which many leſſer mazers doth containe,
               So many vertues in this one do raigne.
            
            
               Why parriall nature ſtepdame to my birth,
               Ye mixed elements affections ſlaues,
               VVhy did ye frame this veſſell but of earth?
               An equall matter to the dead mens graues,
               And ioynd thereto a ſpirt like the waues:
               Low as the earth although my Genius be,
               Yet doth it touch skye threatning Maieſtie.
            
            
               O were my wit but equall to my will,
               VVere I as wiſe as I am ignorant,
               Here were a place that would deſerue my skill,
               Had I as great experience as I want,
               Then would I in a booke of Adamant,
               And Inke compoz'd by water made of golde,
               VVith pens of Diamond thy prayſe vnfolde.
            
            
               
               Let Iuſtice rule the organ of thy ſpeech,
               And Clemency adorne thy Princely browe:
               Vnto thine eares long abſent patience teach,
               By theſe which good men wiſh, let all men knowe,
               None but thy ſelfe, thy ſelfe can ouerthrowe.
               Let pittie check the rod when we offend,
               That makes the good more good, the bad to mend.
            
            
               I witneſſe call the ſeuen hilled Queene,
               How we obey'd, when Lawes obey'd were:
               And ſhall not we be now as we have bene?
               Feare made vs then vnnaturall bondage beare,
               VVe now ſecurely liue, and cannot feare.
               Doubt not thereof,Cornelius Tanitus in the life of Agrippa. but come experience haue,
               VVe loue to ſerue, but loathe the name of ſlaue.
            
            
               Our gazing expectation longes to ſee
               The true admired Image of thy Syre:
               Which Nature hath ſo rightly grau'd in thee:
               As Phiſicke cauſes ſeem'd, they did conſpire
               To ſhape the like to him whom all admire.
               So Sions ſacred ſinger Dauid ſaies,
               Good trees bring forth good fruit, good fruit alwaies.
            
            
               Do not ſweete Sallets ſpring from ſoundeſt ſeed?
               And is not man like God, which man did make?
               Can bad effects from cauſes good proceed?
               Do we ſee fruite on any withered ſtake?
               Or do we ſee in ſea a buſh or brake?
               How canſt thou then not good and perfect bee,
               That wert engraft on ſuch a goodly tree?
            
            FINIS.
