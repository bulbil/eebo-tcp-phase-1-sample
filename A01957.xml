            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               williams Gouernour of the moſt famous ſocietie of Marchauntes Aduenturers into Flaunders. And to the righte VVorſhipfull the Conſult, Aſsiſtens, and comminaltie of the ſame ſocietie, Humfrey Baker wiſheth health with continuall increaſe of commoditie by their worthie trauaile.
            
               ALthough heretofore (right worſhipfull) diuers and ſundrye wel ſkilled men in y• feate, and ſcience of numbrynge, haue not ſpared their labour, not onelie in beatifiyng, but alſo in augmentyng the ſame with ſuch increaſe of witte, as hath excedinglye contained the ſtudientes therein, and made them riper, in the exacte knowledge and redineſſe of it. Yet becauſe an arte can not haue to muche ſetting furthe, neither can be to muche commonded, I (amonge, and after ſo man
                  •

wittes) am bolde to putte forthe the fruicte of my blunt vnderſtandyng and trauaile, in the like ſcience, not correctyng or reprouyng any mans former edition, but makyng an attempte of my groſſe, and meane ſtudie herein, to the entent that thys my enterpriſe maye (by other mennes doinges (bee either gentlie amended, or frendlie receiued. And becauſe I deſire ſpeciallie that it may bee gratfullie accepted, I haue choſen you (worſhipful) to be as defendours of this little lucubration, to whom I knowe it ſhall bee welcome, not ſo muche for my ſake, as for the ſcience loue it ſelfe, wherin it is wel knowen you haue ripe iudgement and good vnderſtandyng, as by youre daylie exerciſes it maie appeare. And although ſome foliſhe heades of fanſie ouerthwart, thinke this Arithmetical art peculier onely to a fewe, vſyng the trade of marchaundiſe, as though it were not ſo neceſſarie for other men: yet I am ſure, the wiſeſt and beſt learned

perceiuyng the wonderfull art, the depe diuiſes, and the cunnyng concluſions that are compriſed in it: affirme it (that of right) to bee the beſte whetſtone, or ſharpnyng of the witte of euerie man that euer was inuented, &amp; thinke it moſt neceſſary to be taught vnto children, without the whiche, nothinge either priuate or common can bee well ordered. And true it is, that whoſoeuer is ignorant of this ſcience of numbring, he ſtepeth in all the reſte and lacketh that promptitude of witt, whiche other haue in callynge and accomptynge of greate ſummes. Yea, I ſaie he that hath the exact knowledge of it, hath a ſpeciall gift of God, and carieth about hym a note and token of a good witte: and I doubt whether euer any was counted or eſtemed ſimple or foliſhe, that had this ſcience in his head Nowe if ſome curiours braine would aſke me this queſtion: ſix you cōmende much your art of numbering, can you tell who was the firſte inuentor of it, or

what this worde Arithmetica doth ſignifie, I would anſwere hym that it is vncertaine who inuented it firſte, but well I knowe, it is one of the ſeuen liberal ſciences: which, if I ſay god gaue vnto man to adourne his life with all, I ſaie as it is, &amp; as wee ought to beleue of whom we acknowledge to haue receiued them &amp; not of the Poetes, or heathen gods, as ſome ſchole men wil ſay. Moreouer, I knowe that Abraham taught it firſt vnto the Egiptians, and no man wil denie but that he receiued all his knowledge of god for he worſhipped no ſtraunge gods neither receiued any giftes or ſciences of them. And although many yeres after, Pythagoras declared it to the Grekes, yet was not he the firſte inuentor of it, but god. Plato alſo commended it as moſt neceſſarie, willinge it to be taught to all youth before all other thinges. And thinkes be to god, it appeareth that his precept hath been very well folowed here in Englande, for I finde not in any

nation (I ſpeake not flateryng my countrey men but commending them) more ready knowledge in this ſcience, then there is in the moſte parte of our youth here in Englande, and namely in London, whiche I ſéeyng it is in them, it is (out of queſtion) in their maſters and tutours, whiche by their greate care ouer theim, haue trained theim vp vnto the practiſe thereof, to whom the greateſte parte of the praiſe redoundeth. And nowe right worſhipfull, when I conſider how little profite my ſimple trauaill ſhall bryng, beyng but as it were an aſſaye of further attempt, I am cōpelled to craue at your handes onely to accepte my good will with the worke: for will &amp; abilitie are ſomewhat vnequall in me, but if abilitie were coreſpōdent to will, I would gladly pleaſure you in greater thinges then this is, whiche is but a ſhadowe incompariſon of other mēnes ſubſtanciall labour and trauail in this art: yet I truſte it is not altogether ſo vnpoliſhed,

but it hath paſſed vnder the file of ſome workemanſhippe, wherby ſome men maye take occaſion of profit and furtherance herein, which is my chiefe deſire, although I knowe many are able to do better: for England is not ſo deſtitute of learned heades, but my doinges may ſone be folowed, yea rather amended. But yet foraſmuche as I would thei ſhould knowe, that knowe not▪ I thought it not good to hide that which hath been opened vnto me. And ſo caſting with my ſelf the ſōme of all, I deſtre you eftſones, right worſhipful (to whome I thought it moſte mete to preſent the fruicte of my ſtudie) thankefullye to receiue it, as your wonted wiſedomes doth all thinges well and vertuouſlie purpoſed.
            Thus fare you well, deſtryng God to maintaine you in youre eſtate, to proſpere &amp; further all your traffickes and voyages, encreaſe you in vertue, and keepe you in good health.
            Amen.
         
      
      
         
            
            THE DIFFINITION of Nomber.
            
               NOmber is as much to ſay, as a multitude compound of manye vnityes, as two is compounde of two vnities, three is compounde of three vnities, foure of foure vnities, fyue of fyue vnities ten of ten, fourtene of fourtene, fyftene of fyftene, twentie of twentie vnities, &amp;c.
            And therefore an vnitie is no nomber, but the beginninge and originall of number, as yf you doe multiplye or diuide an vnitie by it ſelfe, it is reſolued into it ſelfe without increaſe. But it is in nomber otherwiſe, for there can be no nomber, howe great ſo euer it bee, but that it maye continuallye be encreaſed by addynge euermore one vnitie vnto the ſame.
            
               Numeration. Cap .i.
               
                  
NUumeration is the art wherby to expreſſe and declare the value of any ſumme propoſed, and is of two kyndes, the one gathereth y• value of a ſum propoſed, &amp; the other expreſſeth anye ſumme conceyued by oue figures and places, for the value is one thinge, and the figures are another thynge: and that cōmeth partlye by the diuerſitye of fygures, but chiefelye of the places wherein they be ordeclye ſei. And fyrſte marke, that there are but ten fygures or characters whiche are vſed in Arithmeticke, wherof nine of them are called ſignifiynge fygures, and the tenth is called a ciphar, whiche is made lyke an 0. and of it ſelfe ſignifieth nothinge, but it beynge ioyned with any of the other figures, encreaſeth their value, and theſe be they.
               
                  1 one.
                  2 two.
                  3 thre.
                  4 four.
                  5 fyue.
                  6 ſyre.
                  7 ſeuen.
                  8 eyght.
                  9. nyne.
               
               
                  
Alſo you ſhal vnderſtande that euery one of theſe fygures hath two values: One is alwaye certaine and hathe his ſignification of his owne forme, and the other is vncertayne whiche be taketh of his place.
               A place is called the ſcate or roome that a figure ſtandeth in, and howe many fygures ſo euer are written in one ſumme, ſo many places hathe the whole value thereof. And that is called the firſte place (whiche nexte is towarde the ryghte hande) of anye ſumme, and ſo recknynge by order towarde the lefte hande, ſo that, that place is laſte whiche is nexte the lefte hande. And contrarywiſe, when you expreſſe the value of the fygures in anye ſumme you muſte begynne at the lefte hande, and ſo recken towarde the ryght hande.
               Euerye of theſe nine fygures, (whiche are called ſignifiynge fygures) hath hys owne ſimple valew

when he is founde alone, or in the fyrſte place of anye ſume. In the ſeconde place towarde the lefte hande; he betokeneth his one valewe ten times. As. 70. is, ſeuen times ten: that is to ſaye ſeuentie, 80. is viii. times ten: that is to ſaye eyghtie. In the thirde place euery fygure betokeneth his owne valew a hundreth times. As. 700. in that thirde place betokeneth, a hundreth tymes. 7. that is to ſaye, ſeuen hundred: In the fourthe place euerye fygure betokeneth hys owne valew a thouſande times. As. 7000. is ſeuen thouſande, and 8000. is eyghte thouſande. Theſe foure fyrſte places muſte be had perfectlye in minde, ye and that by harte, for by the knowledge of them you maye expreſſe all kinde of nombres howe great ſo euer they be.
               In the fyfte place euery figure by tokeneth his owne valewe tenne thouſande times. As 70000. is ten tymes ſeauen thouſande, that is to

ſayē ſeauentie thouſand: In the ſytte place euerye fygure ſtandeth for his owne valew, a hundreth thouſande tymes. As 700000, is ſeauen hundreth thouſande. The vii. place a M. M. times, or a million: as 7000000, is vii. M. M. or vii. millions. And the viii. place .x. M. M. times, or ten millions, ſo that euery place towarde the lefte hande, excedeth the former ten times. But nowe for the eaſye readynge, and Redye expreſſynge orderlye of anye ſumme propoſed you ſhall practiſe this maner, folowing. And for example I propone this nomber 765432658. in the whiche are nine places. In the fyrſte place is 8. and betokeneth, but eyghte, in the ſeconde place is 5. and betokeneth, x. times fyue that is fyfte, in the thirde place is ſyxe, and betokeneth a. C. tymes ſyxe, that is .vi. C. In the forthe place is. 2. and that is twoo. M. And 3. in the fyfte places is x. M. tymes 3. that is xxx. M. So 4. in the ſyxie

place is a C. thouſand times. 4. that is .iiii. C. M. then fyue in the ſeuenth place is a. M. M. times 5. that is v. M. or rather 5. millyons. And 6. in the viii. place is .vi. times x. millions, that is lx. millions. And laſte of all .vii. in the. ix place, is vii. C. millions now foloweth the practiſe. Fyrſte put a prick ouer the fourthe fygure, and ſo ouer the ſeuenthe, and lykewyſe ouer the tenthe. And alſo ouer the 13, 16. or 19 if you had ſo many, and ſo ſtil leauinge twoo fygures betwene euerye twoo prickes and thoſe roomes from one pricke to an other are called ternaries, then you muſte pronounce euery three fygures from one pricke to an other as though they were written alone from the reſte. And at the ende of theyr valewe, adde ſo manye tymes thouſande, as your nomber hathe prickes (that is to ſaye, yf there be but 1. pricke, it is but one M. yf two prickes a M. M. or els a million yt 3. prickes a. M. M. M. or a M.

million, and ſo conſequentlye of all other fygures folowynge.) Then come lykewyſe to the nexte three fygures, and ſounde them as yf they were aparte from the reſte, and adde to their valewe ſo manye times thouſandes as there are pryckes betwene them and the fyrſt place of your whole nomber. And ſo do by they next three fygures folowyng and of all the reſte likewiſe as in exāple. 451234678567. The fyrſte pricke is ouer. 8. in the fourth place, whiche is the place of a. M. the Seconde pricke is ouer 4. in the vii. place, whiche is the place of a M. M. or one million, the third pricke is ouer the .x. place whiche is the place of a M. M. M. or of a M. million, as in the former example. Then for the expreſſynge of this nomber by the valewe of euerye fygure, accordynge to the place wherin they ſtande
                     •
                  , you ſhall fyrſte begynne at the laſte prycke ouer one, and take yt and the other twoo fygures. 5. and. 4.

whiche do folowe him &amp; valew them alone and they are iiij. C li. MMM. or els CCCC li. M. millions. Then take the other iij. fygures from one to the nerte pricke, and valewe them as if they were a parte from the other, and they are. 234. which are. CCxxxiiij. million, or 234. MM. Then come to the thyrde pricke ouer 8. and take the other ii. fygures behinde it, and recken them lykewyſe as yf they were alone, and they are vi C lxxviii. M. And laſte of all come to the other twoo fygures whiche remaine, that is. 567. and they are fyue Clxvii. Thus the whole ſume of theſe fygures, is iiii. Cli. M. ii Cxxxiiii. Millions, viC .lxxviii. M. vClxvii, as before.

               ¶ Of ſubſtraction in whole nomber. chap. 3.
               SUbſtraction teacheth howe you ſhal abate one leſſer number from a greater, and what there doth reremaine after that you ſhall haue abated the ſame, I ſpeake not of the abating of one egall nomber, from an other egall vnto it, for the facilitie therof requireth no Rule.
               In ſubſtraction are founde three nombers, the one is that, from the whiche the ſubſtraction is made. The ſeconde is the nomber, that is to be ſubſtracted, and the thirde is the nomber whiche remaineth after the ſubſtraction is ended. As when I woulde ſubſtract. 25. from 40. The 40. is the nomber from the which the ſubſtraction is made, 25. is the nombre to be ſubſtracted, and. 15. is the nomber whiche remaineth after you haue done the ſubſtraction, here foloweth the practiſe. You ſhall put the leſſer nōber vnder the greater in ſuch

ſorte, that euerye figure of the one numbre maye aunſwere vnto euerye fygure of the other orderlye, and then drawe a right lyne vnder thoſe twoo numbers, as you dyd in Addition. Then muſte you beginne at the right hande and take the fyrſte figure of the vndermoſte number, and abate that from the firſt figure of the vppermoſt numbre, and that whiche remaineth you muſte ſet vnderneth the line right vnder that figure which you haue ſubſtracted. Then afterwarde take likewiſe the ſeconde figure of the neither
                     •
                   moſte ſnumbre, and abate that alſo from the ſeconde fygure of the higher numbre. The thirde from the thirde, and ſoe fourth of all the reſte tyll you come to the ende, puttynge alwayes the remaine of euerye fygure vnder the line in hys order, example. I will ſubbſtracte. 2345. from 9876. 
                     〈 math 〉
                   after that I haue put them doune accordynge to the maner aforeſaied.

I take firſte. 5. from. 6. and there reſteth. 1. the whiche I ſette vnder the lyne right againſte. 5. Secondlye I abate. 4. from. 7. and there reſteth. 3. the whiche I ſet in the ſeconde place vnder the lyne, nexte after. 1. Thirdly, I abate. 3. from. 8. and there reſteth 15. The whiche I put vnder the line in the thirde place, finallye I doe abate. 2. from. 9. and there reſteth. 7. the whiche I putte vnder the lyne in the fourth and laſte place, and thus is this ſubſtraction ended, by the whiche there reſteth. 753.
               But when twoo fygures of one likenes doe chaunce to meete, ſo that the one muſte bee abated from the other, as if I ſhoulde abate ſeuen from ſeuen, there remaineth nothyng, and then muſte I ſet a ciphre. 0. vnder the line. But when the figure whiche is to bee abated, dothe excede the figure whiche is ouer hym, ſo that it can not be taken out of the ſame figure. Then muſte you abate the neather fygure

from, 10. And that whiche dothe remain you ſhall adde vnto the ſame figure whiche is vppermoſt. And the ſum whiche commeth therof ſhall you ſet vnder the line. But when ſo euer you do borow any ſuch. 10. of the ouer nomber: you muſte adde. 1. vnto the nexte neather fygure folowynge whiche is to bee abated. And there is nothinge elles to be done in ſubſtraction. Example I will ſubſtract 93576. from. 4037479. after that I haue placed my two nombers, as I ought to do, I do fyrſt.

                   Abate. 6. from 9. and there reſteth. 3. then I put the 3. vnder the line righte againſt. 6. And ſecondlye, I abate. 7. from 7. And there reſteth nothinge. I doe put a cipher. 0. vnder the line right againſte. 7. in the ſeconde place. Then I come to the third place where I finde. 5. whiche I cannot abate from the fygure ouer hym whiche is but

4: therfore I do abate it from 10. as before I taught, and there reſteth. 5. the whiche I doe adde wyth the. 4. whiche is ouer hym, and that maketh. 9. I put 9. in thirde place vnder the line for the thirde fygure, fourthlye for the. 10. whiche I borowed I adde one vnto the nerte neather fygure whiche is 3. and they make 4. the whiche I doe abate from the ouer fygure. 7. and there reſteth 3. I put. 3. vnder the lyne for the fourth fygure. And then I come to the fyfte place where I do fynde. 9. whiche I can not abate from the fygure ouer hym whiche is but. 3. but I abate 9. from 10. and there reſteth. 1. the whiche I do adde with 3. and they make, 4. I put. 4. vnder the lyne for the fyfte fygure. And if it were not, for that I did laſte borowe. 10. the ſubſtraction ſhoulde haue bene ended. But for bycauſe that I muſte (for euerye ſuche tenne that I borowe) alwayes adde. 1. vnto the nexte neather

figure folowyng, I muſte therefore proceade vnto the ſubſtraction. And for that, that there is noe other figure folowyng in the neather number, it ſhall ſuffice to haue kepte the vnitee, and to abate it from the nerte ouer figure. But I find there. 0. and I cannot abate. 1. from. 0. therefore I abate it from. 10. and there reſteth nine whiche I doe putte vnder the lyne in the ſixte place, fynallie for the tenthe, which I borowed, I kéepe. 1. in mind. The whiche I doe abate from. 4. and there remaineth thre, the whiche I do 
                     〈…〉
                  tte vnder the lyne in the ſeauenth place after nine. And the operation is thus ended.

                      But if there were many numbers to be ſubſtracted from one numbre alone, then muſte you firſte adde thoſe numbers together according vnto the

doctrine of the chapitre goyng before, and then to make your ſubſtraction as aboue ſaied. As if I would abate theſe thre ſummes. 123. 234. 456. frō. 98925 firſt I do adde the. 3 ſummes into one and thei are 813.

               ¶ Of multiplication. Chapiter. 4.
               
                  IN multiplication there are thre numbers to bee noted, that is to ſaie the numbre whiche is to bee multiplied, the whiche wee will call the multiplicande: and the numbre by the whiche we multiplie, we call the multiplier, or multiplicator. And the third numbre is that which commeth of the multiplication of the one by the other, which is called the product. As when I would knowe how much moūteth. 10. multiplied by 9. y• is to ſaie how much are. 10. tymes 9. I find that thei ar worth 90. thā 10. is the multiplicāo. 9. is the multipter.
               
                  
And 90. is called the producte: Then for to multiplye, is none other thinge, but to fynde a nombre whiche conteineth the multiplicande ſo many tymes, as the multiplyer conteineth vnities. As 10. multiplyed by 9. do make 90. as before ſaid. And 90. conteyneth 10. ſo manye tymes, as 9. conteineth vnities, that is to ſaye nyne times.
               In multiplycation, it forceth not muche whiche of the twoo nombers by the multiplicande, nor whiche be the multiplier. For 10. multiplyed by 9. maketh as manye as 9. multiplied by. 10. yet neuertheles it ſhalbe more commodious that the leſſer nomber be alwayes the multiplier.
               And for that, that the multiplication of fygures the one by the other, is the moſte chiefe and neceſſaryeſt kynde, whereby to knowe howe to worke in the multiplication of compounde nombers, and that euery man hath it not at the fingers

ende: I wyll therfore gyue you heare certein eaſye wayes of multiplication of diget nombers. When you woulde multiplye twoo ſimple fygures, or digits the one by the other, abate eche of thoſe diget nombers from 10. Then multiplye the twoo remaines the one by the other. And if the ſumme doe excede 10. writte onely the firſte fygure, and kepe the other to be added to the nexte operation, whiche is thus. Adde your two ſimple figures togither: And of the which reſulteth of that addicion, take onelye the fyrſte fygure, vnto the whiche you muſte adde the vnitye whiche you kept before. And that ſhalbe the ſeconde fygure of the ſumme which you do ſeeke. Example, I woulde multiply 7. by 6. I take 7. from 10. and there reſteth 3. likewiſe I abate 6. from 10. &amp; there reſteth 4. then I ſaye thus 3. times 4. make 12. I writte 2. for my firſt fygure, &amp; I kepe 1. in my minde, then I adde 6. with 7. and they are 13. of the

whiche I caſte awaie the ſeconde figure. 1. and I take onelie the firſte fygure. 3. vnto the whiche I adde the vnitie whiche I kepte, and they make 4. whiche I wryte in the ſeconde place after. 2. And thus I finde. 42. whiche is the valuer of 7. multiplied by. 6.
               Otherwiſe, and all commeth to one effecte, ſette doiune youre two dig
                     ••
                  e numbers the one right ouer the other, and right againſt euery or them towarde the right hande wryt &amp; hys owne diſtaunce from. 10. Then multiplie the two differences together, the figure whiche commeth thereof, ſhall you ſet doune vnder both the differences. But if there be two fygures ſette doune but the fyrſte, and keepe the other in youre mynde, afterwardes abate (from one of the two digit numbers) the difference of the other digite number that is to ſaie, croſwiſe. And vnto the remayne adde the fygure whiche you kepte, and that ſhall bée

the ſeconde nomber, and thus you ſhall haue your multiplication. Exā
                  ple of the like figures, that is to ſaie, of 7. multiplied by. 6. the diſtaunce of. 7. vnto. 10. is. 3. And the diſtaunce of. 6. from. 10. is. 4. I ſette them doune croſſewaies, as you ſee: 
                     〈 math 〉
                   And then I ſaie. 3. tymes. 4. are. 12. I ſette doune. 2. and keepe one in my mynde, then I abate. 4. from. 7. or els. 3. from. 6. it forceth not from whiche of theim: and there reſteth alwaies. 3. vnto the whiche I adde the vnitie, whiche I kepte in my mynde, and thei are fower, whiche ſhall bee the ſeconde figure of the multiplication. And thus I finde that ſeuen, multiplied by ſixe, maketh fowertle and twoo, as in the other operation. This practiſe hath no place where the twoo digette noumbers (dooe not exceade tenne) by addyng theim together, and then is

multiplication eaſye ynoughe without any rule.
               An other waye to knowe the multiplication of ſymple numbers, is by this table folowyng: the vſe whereof is thus.
               Fyrſte you ſhall vnderſtande, that the nombers from 1. and ſo downewardes to 9. ſet in the left part or hanging margin of this table do betoken the multipliers of all ſimple nombers. And the elements or fygures beyng put higheſt in euery ſquare roome drawynge towarde youre ryght hande right againſt euery of the multipliers, doe ſignifie, the multiplicands, vnto the multipliers of the hangyng margin. And the lower or inferiour nombers in euerye ſquare roome, do betoken the product of that multiplication, which is made in multiplyinge the vpper nomber ouer it, wyth the figure in the hanging margin, anſwering directly vnto the ſayd ſquare: as by example.

Firſte, becauſe one doeth not multiplie, I ſette in the vpper margin the figures from. 1. to. 9. bothe in the hier and alſo in the inferiour rowes, for one in the hangyng margine, multiplied by one the vpper nomber in the firſte ſquare bryngeth but one, ſo likewiſe twoo beyng the higher nomber in the ſeconde ſquare of the vpper margine, multiplied by. 1. in the hangyng margine, bryngeth twoo for the lower nō
                  ber in the ſeconde ſquare of the vpper margine, for one tymes one maketh but one, and one tymes twoo maketh twoo, then one tymes three maketh. 3. and one tymes fower maketh fower, and ſo continewyng toward the right hande, vntill you come to the figure of 9. whiche is one tymes. 9. maketh. 9. Then after multiplie twoo of the hangyng margine by twoo, the vpper nō
                  ber of the ſquare, nexte towarde the right hande, and that maketh fower, whiche is the producte of twoo, multiplied by twoo, whiche fower is ſet vnder

the twoo, for twoo times twoo are fower, and twoo tymes thred maketh ſixe, then twoo tymes fower maketh 8. and twoo tymes. 5. maketh. 10. and ſo conunewyng vnto twoo tymes. 9. whiche maketh. 18. The like is to bee doen with the thirde rowe, and ſo likewiſe of all the reſidue.
               Example, I would knowe what is the producte of. 9. multiplied by. 8. I ſeke in the hangyng margin the multiplier eight, and emongeſt the ſquares directly againſte eight, drawyng toward the right hande, I ſeke the multiplicande. 9. in the higher rowe, and I finde the producte right vnder. 9. to bee. 72. Then. 72. is the nomber which commeth of the multiplication of. 9. by eight, and ſo is to bee vnderſtande of all the reſte of the table, whiche table muſte bee of all menne learned by harte, or as thei ſaie without booke, whiche beyng learned, you ſhall the better attaine to the reſle of multiplication.

To come nowe vnto the practiſe of multiplication, when you woulde multiplye twoo nombers, the one by the other, you muſte ſet them downe after the ſame maner as you dyd in addicion, and in ſubſtraction. That is to ſaye, the firſt fygure of the multiplier, vnder the firſte figure of the multiplicande, the ſecond vnder the ſeconde, and the third vnder the third, yf there be ſo manye, and then drawe a ryghte lyne vnder them, as in the other operations goynge before.
               After you ſhall multiplie all the fygures of the multiplicande by the multiplyer, and ſet downe the fygures (commynge of any ſuche multiplication) vnder the lyne euery one in order.
               Example, I woulde multiplye 123. by. 3. that is to ſaye, I woulde knowe howe muche amounteth iij. tymes one hundreth, twentie and three. The twoo nombers beynge placed in ſuche order as is before

ſaied, you muſte beginne towardes the right hande: and ſay thus three tymes thrée are nine, wryte downe 9. vnder the line right againſte 3. for the firſte figure: 
                     〈 math 〉
                   ſecondlye by the ſame thrée you muſte multiplie the ſeconde fygure 2. and they make 6: putte downe 6. after the 9. vnder the line: Thirdly by the ſame 3. you ſhall multiplie the laſt figure. 1. and they are but 3. ſet doune 3 after 6. for the thirde and laſte figure. And thus is that worke ended: wherby you ſhal finde, that 123. being multiplied by 3. maketh 369.
               But when that of the multiplication of one figure by an other: The ſum whiche commeth thereof ſhal be of two figures, as it happeneth moſte often, then ſhall you wryte downe the firſte figure, and kepe the other figure to bee added vnto the multiplication of the next figure.
               Example. Syxe menne haue gained (euery one of them) 345. crownes,

I woulde knowe howe manye Crownes, thei hadde in all. 
                     〈 math 〉
                  Fyrſte I multiplye 6. times fiue are. 30. I wright. 0. vnder the line, and keepe. 3. to bee added to the next multiplication: Secondlye I ſaie 6. tymes four, are. 24. vnto the whyche I adde 3. whyche I reſerued. And thei make 27. I wryt. 7. in the ſecond place vnder the line, and I kéepe 2. to be added to the next multiplication, thirdlie I ſaie ſire tymes. 3. are 18. vnto the whiche I adde the. 2. whiche I kepe, and thei make. 20. the whiche I wright all doune for becauſe that is the laſte woorke. And ſo I fynde that 345. beyng multiplied by. 6. doe make 2070. Whan the multiplier is of manie figures you muſte multiplie al the whole multiplycande by euerye one of thoſe figures, &amp; wryte the productes euerie one vnder his owne figure.
               Example. I woulde knowe howe manye dayes are paſte from the natiuitie

of Ieſus Chriſte vntill the yeare 1560. full complete. I haue to multiplie. 1560. by 365. which are the daies of one whole yere. The leape yeares not beyng reckened, which haue euerie one of them. 366. daies.
               Firſt by the figure. 5. I multiplie 
                     〈 math 〉
                  all the higher fygures, ſaiyng thus. 5. tymes. 0. maketh. 0. I wryte. 0. vnder the lyne for the firſte fygure, and becauſe I kéepe nothyng for the next place. I procede and ſaye. 5. tymes 6. are. 30. I ſette 0. vnder the lyne for the ſeconde fygure, and I keepe. 3. to bee added to the next multiplication, thirdlie I ſay 5. tymes. 5. are. 25. The whiche with 3. that I keepe are. 28. I ſette doune 8. and keepe. 2. to bée added with the next multiplication. Then comming vnto the fourth and laſt fygure, I ſaie fiue tymes. 1. are. 5. the whiche with 2. that I reſerued are 7. I putte 7. for the laſte fygure of thys fyrſte operation

by the figure. 5. with the which figure we haue no more to doe. And therfore I cancel theſame. 8. with a little ſtrik through it, to ſignifie that wée haue finiſhed with that figure. And for as muche that in multiplication there is alwaies as manie ſimple operations, as the multiplier conteineth figures. There reſteth yet twoo operations to be made. I come then vnto the ſeconde operation, whiche is by the fygure 6. by the whiche I muſte againe multiply all the figures of the multiplicand as I did by 5 and the firſt figure, which ſhalbe produced, you muſte putte one ranke more lower then the figures of the operation euen nowe made by fiue: not right vnder the firſte fygure of the multiplier fiue, but vnder ſixe: that is to ſay: one place more forward then the fiue towarde the left hande, and one rancke more lower then the firſte operation: and you ſhall put afterwarde euerie of the other figures whiche commeth of the ſame multiplication

in their order: thirdlye you muſte make the multiplication by the thirde figure and that whiche ſhall come thereof you muſte ſette in hys rancke, as here vnder you ſee. And nowe wee néede make no further diſcourſe hereof, becauſe that hee whiche canne doe the firſte multiplication by fiue, may as eaſely doe all the others. It ſhall therefore ſuffice to ſette here vnder the examples.

               Nowe, if you will knowe howe muche the operations thus placed doe amount vnto, which in value are but one number: you muſt adde thoſe thre numbers together, but not after the ſame maner as wee haue done in the chapiter of addition, the firſt figure of the firſt ranck with the firſte figure of the ſecond ranck, and of the thirde: but

you muſte adde them in the ſame ſort as you ſhall finde them ſituated or placed: that is to ſaie, the firſte figure of the fyrſte rancke alone by it ſelfe the ſeconde of that ranck with the firſt of the ſeconde rancke. The thirde of the firſte rancke wyth the ſeconde fygure of the thyrde rancke: and ſo of all other as hereafter doth appeare.

And to be briefe, when the laſte figure of the multiplier is. 1. and all the reſt be ciphers, adde ſo many ciphers to your multiplicande, as ther ſhalbe foūd in your multiplier
                  But yf in multipliyng, the laſte fygure were not one, but that there were onelye certayne Cyphers in the beginnynge: and that the other were ſignifiynge fygures, and

likewiſe thoſe of that multiplicande, then ſhall you putte thoſe cyphers a part, and multiplie the ſignifiyng figures of the one by the ſignifiyng figures of the other. Than adde vnto the product of that multiplication, all the ciphers whiche you dyd before put a part. As if I would multiply. 46000 by 3500. I put apart the thrée ciphers of the fyrſte, and twoo ciphers of the ſeconde numbers. And then I multiply fourtie ſixe by 35. and thereof commeth 2610: vnto the whiche I add the 00000. and then the whole producte will be. 161000000.

               Of diuition the 5. chapiter.
               
                  DIuition or partition is, to ſeeke how many times one numbre dothe containe an other for in thys operation at firſt required two numbers for the findyng out of the thirde. The firſte numbre is called the diuidende or numbre whiche is to bee deuided, and that muſte bee the greater numbre, the other numbre is called the diuiſor, and that is the leſſer. And the thirde numbre which we ſeeke is called the quotient. As if I woulde deuide 36. by 9. the diuidend ſhal be 36. and the diuiſour is 9. And for becauſe that nine is conteined in 36. foure times, that is to ſaie, that 4: times 9. do make 36. The quotient ſhalbe 4. as in marking how many tymes 9. is conteined in 36.
               
                  The practiſe.
                  Write doune firſte the diuidende in the hygher number, and the diuiſor

vnderneth, in ſuche ſorte, that the firſt fygure of the diuiſour towarde the lefte hande be vnder the firſt of the diuidend, and euerie figure of the ſame diuiſour vnder hys lyke, that is to ſay, the fyrſte vnder the firſte, the ſeconde vnder the ſeconde, the third vnder the thyrde, and ſo conſequentlye of the other, yf there bée anie more, whiche is contrarie to the other three kyndes before ſpecified, but you muſte conſyder if all the lower fygures of the diuiſor, maye be taken out of the higher figures of the diuidence, by the order of ſubſtraction. The whiche if you canne not doe, then muſte you ſette the fyrſte fygure of the Dyuyſour (towarde the lefte hande) vnder the ſeconde figure of the diuidende, and ſoe conſequently the reſte, if anie bée to be ſette doune euerie one of them vnder his like as before is ſaied. And than drawe a line betwene the diuidence and the diuiſour. And at the ende of them an other croked line, behinde the whiche towarde

the right hand, ſhal be ſet your quotient. As by this example following wher the diuiſor is but of 1. figure
                  If you woulde diuide 860. by. 4. you muſte ſette doune. 4. vnder the. 8. with a line betwene them as herevnder you may ſee. 
                        〈 math 〉
                     
                  
                  And then you muſte ſeeke howe many times the diuiſour in contained in the higher numbre, or diuidende aunſwering to him, as in this our example I muſte ſeke how many tymes 4. is contained in. 8. in the whiche I finde 2. tymes, then I wryte doune. 2. aparte behinde the crooked lyne, as you ſe, whiche ſhall be the firſte figure of the quotient to come, ſecondlye by this figure (beeynge thus putte aparte) I muſt multiply the diuiſor: 
                        〈 math 〉
                      and vnder the ſame multiplication.
                  I muſte ſette that number whiche

commcth of the ſame multiplication, as two tymes foure doe make eight, whiche eight I doe ſet vnder the four, whiche is the diuiſour. Thirdlie I doe ſubſtract the producte of the ſaied multiplication (of the quotient by the diuiſor) from the higher numbre coreſpondant to the ſame, as if I abate 8. from 8. there rematneth nothyng, and then I cancell or ſtryke out that whiche is doen as you ſee. In theſe three operations is comprehended the art of diuition. The which ar to be obſeraed from point to point, for there is no diuerſity in the finiſhyng of the ſame whiche is thus.
                  I muſte remoue mye diuiſor one place nerer towarde my right hande, as in procedyng with. oure exāple, I remoue 
                        〈 math 〉
                      my diuiſour 4. whiche was vnder. 8. and I ſet it vnder. 6. then I ſeeke howe manye tymes. 4. is conteined in. 6. where I finde but one tyme, then I ſette. 1. behinde

the croked line behinde. 2. afterwarde by this laſte and new figure. 1. I multiplie the diuiſour. 4 and that maketh but. 4 (for an vninitie whiche is but. 1. encreaſeth nothyng) I abate 4. from the higher figure. 6. and there reſteth. 2. the whiche 2. I ſette ouer the 6. and I cancell the. 6. for ſo muſt you do when there reſteth any thing after you haue made the ſubſtractiō. Thirdlye for that there yet remaineth an other, figure in the diuidend, I remoue againe the diuiſour, and I ſett vnder the cipher. 0. Then I ſeeke how many tymes foure is in the higher number whiche is. 10. where I fynde 5. times, I put. 5. behinde 
                        〈 math 〉
                      the crooked iyne for the third and laſt figure of the quotient. Then by the ſame 5. I multiplie the diuiſour 4. and that maketh 20. the whiche I abate from the higher number, and there reſteth nothing. And ſo is thys diuiſyon ended: and I

haue founde that. 860. being diuided by foure, bringeth for the quotient 215. that is to ſaie, that. 4. is conteined in 860. twoo hundred and fiftene tymes. This is the moſte eaſteſt workynge that is in diuiſion, but that whiche foloweth, appertayneth to the whole and perfecte vnderſtandyng of the ſame. When the firſte figure of your diuiſor towarde your lefte hande is greater then the firſte of diuidende, you muſt not place the firſte figure of your diuiſor right vnderneth the firſt of your diuidend, but vnder y• 2. figure of the ſame diuidende, nerer to your right hand, as before is ſaied.
                  When the diuiſour is of manye figures, and that you haue to ſéeke howe manye tymes it is contained in the higher numbre (for the more eaſier workyng) you muſt uot ſeeke to abate the diuiſour all at one tyme, but you muſte ſee and marke howe maye tymes the firſte figure of the ſame towarde the leſte hande is contained in

the higher numbre aunſweringe to the ſaied numbre, and then to work after y• ſame maner as is before taught.
                  Erample. I haue. 316215. crownes to be deuided amonge. 45. menne for to make my diuiſion, I muſte not putte the firſte figure of the diuiſour whiche is. 4. vnder the firſte of the deuidende, whiche is. 3. becauſe that. 4. is greater number then. 3. And further, I can not take. 4. out of. 3. wherfore I muſte ſette the. 4. vnder the ſeconde figure of the higher number whiche is. 1. and the fygure. 5. of the diuiſour next right vnder the 6. as you maie ſée.
                  I muſte firſte ſéeke, home many tymes 
                        〈 math 〉
                      45. ie contayned in 316. whiche is but parte of the diuidende, wherefore for the more caſie workyng I nede but to ſeke how many tymes 4. is conteined in 31. &amp; becauſe I may haue it 7. tymes I put. 7. behinde the croked line, as is

afore ſaied, then by. 7. I multiply all the diuiſour. 45. and they are 315: the whiche I ſet vnder the ſame diuiſour, the fyrſte figure vnder the fyrſte. And the other in order towarde the lefte hande. Then I ſubſtract thre hundred fiftine, from the higher number. 316. and of this fyrſt working there remaineth but. 1. the whiche I ſette ouer the 6 and I cancell the 315, and the other figures 3, 1, 6, alſo the diuiſour: and then it will ſtande thus. 
                        〈 math 〉
                     
                  
                  And when I come to remoue the diuiſour, and that I muſte ſéeke howe manye tymes it is contained in the higher numbre, if I ſe that I can not finde it there, that is to ſaie that if the higher numbre be leſſer thā the diuiſonr, as it is in this example, then muſt I put a cipher in the quotient behind the croked line, and if ther remaine anye fygures in the diuidende

whiche are not finiſhed, I muſt remoue t
                        〈…〉
                      diuiſor againe nerer towarde my right hande by one place, for to finde a newe figure in the quociente. As in this our example, for after that I haue remoued the diuiſor, I ſeke how many tymes. 45. is conteined 
                        〈 math 〉
                      in. 12. and becauſe I can not haue. 45. in. 12. I put a 0. behinde the croked line after 7. then without multipliyng or abatyng, I remoue again the diuiſor nerer toward my right hand, and I ſeke how many tymes 4 (which is the firſt figure of the diuiſour) is in the higher nomber, that is to ſaie, in. 12. whereas 
                        〈 math 〉
                      I find it 3. times I putte. 3. behinde the croked line, for the thirde figure of the quocient: then by. 3. I multiply the diuiſor. 45. and thereof commeth 135.
                  
                     
But here is to bee noted, that if it happen that the figure beyng laſte founde, whiche is put in the quotient, doe produce or bryng for the a greater number (in multipliyng al the diuiſor by the ſame) then that whiche is ouer the ſaied diuiſor: you muſt then make the ſame figure of your quotient (whiche you dooe put doune) leſſer by one. and after that you haue cancelled the firſte multiplication, you muſte make a newe. And the ſame muſt be ſo doen as often tymes: as (in decreaſyng the ſame) it produceth a leſſer number, or at the leaſte, a number egall to that, whiche is ouer it. As in the laſte work for becauſe that the diuiſour, beyng multiplied by. 3. bryngeth for the 135. whiche amounteth more then 121. the ſame producte muſt be cancelled. And likewiſe the figure. 3. whiche I did put in the quotiēt, muſt be chaunged into a figure of. 2. Then by the ſaied. 2. I muſt multiplie the diuiſor. 45. &amp; therof commeth 90. the whiche I abate from

121. and there remaineth. 31. And then will the ſomme ſtande thus. 
                        〈 math 〉
                     
                  
                  And here is alſo to be noted, that the A note. ſomme whiche remaineth, muſt be alwaies leſſer then the diuiſor. Then finally, I remoue the diuiſor to the. 2. laſt figures towarde the right hande, and I ſeeke how many tymes 4. is in 31. And for becauſe I finde it. 7. times I put. 7. in the quotient: by the which I multiplie the diuiſoure, and thereof commeth. 315 the whiche I abate frō the higher number of the diuidende, and there remaineth nothyng, as here you maie ſee. 
                        〈 math 〉
                     
                  
                  
                     
But in caſe that after the diuiſion is ended, there doe remaine any thyng in the diuidende, as moſte often times there doeth: I muſt then ſette that remaine aparte behinde the croked line, after the entier quotiente, and the diuiſor, right vnder theſame remaine, with a line betwene them bothe, as in this diuiſion followyng, where there remaineth. 3. in the laſt woorke of the ſame. And we ſhall ſee what the ſame doeth ſignifie, when we ſhall treate of fractions, or broken nombers.

In ſomme, all the whole practiſe of diuiſion, maie be kept in remēbraūce by three letters, that is to ſaie: S. M. A whiche three letters dooe ſignifie to ſeeke, to multiplie, to abate.
                  Firſte, I muſt ſeeke how many tymes the diuiſor is conteined in the higher nomber: then, by the quotiente (whiche I finde) I muſt multiplie the diuiſor: finally, I muſt abate the producte of that multiplicacion, from the higher nomber to theſame correſpondent, that is to ſaie: out of the diuidēde aunſweryng to the diuiſor.
                  And further, beſides this kinde of woorkyng in diuiſion. The whiche is reguler and common: I will here put an other maner of woorkyng verie eaſie. The whiche ſhall ſerue for ſuche diuiſiōs as are difficil to be wrought. That is to witte, when the nomber to bee diuided is verie greate, and the diuiſor greate alſo, and it ſhall ſerue againe for to auoide errour in ſupputacion, and for the placyng of fewer

figures in the quotiente: and conſequently it ſhall ſaue muche labor vnto thē, whiche as yet haue not muche ſtudied in this art. The practiſe wherof is thus, as followeth.
                  I haue to deuide. 7894658. by 643. In the firſte place, you ſhall vnderſtande, that although the firſte figure of the diuiſor towarde your lefte hande, maie bee founde many tymes in the higher number, as. 10. tymes, 12. tymes or more: yet is it ſo, that you muſt neuer putte but one figure onely at a tyme in your quotient.
                  And thus you ſhall at no tyme put any number in your quotient, whiche exceadeth the figure of. 9. that is to ſaie, any number beyng greater then 9. for to come then vnto your practiſe, write donne your diuiſour one tyme: and behinde it towarde youre righte hande, drawe a line doune ſtraighte, and right againſt theſame diuiſor behinde the line put this figure. 1. Then double your ſaied diuiſour, and right

againſte the ſame (beyng doubled) put behinde the line the figure of. 2. After adde vnto the ſame number (whiche you doubled) your ſaied diuiſour, and right againſte the ſame producte, behinde the line putte the figure of 3. And vnto this thirde producte, you muſte adde againe your diuiſor: and right againſte the ſame producte, behinde the line ſette the figure. 4. And this muſte you dooe, vntill you come to the figure of. 9: in ſuche ſorte that euery of the productes doe ſurmounte ſo muche his former noumber, as all the diuiſoure dooeth amounte vnto: placyng at the right ſide of euery producte behinde the line, the noumber whiche ſignifieth howe muche he is in order. That is to ſaie, righte againſte the fifte producte, you muſte putte. 5. right againſte the ſixte producte, you muſt put. 6: and ſo likewiſe of all the other.
                  Example of the diuiſour proponed, 643. firſte, I write doune. 643. and

right againſt the ſame behinde the 
                        〈 math 〉
                      line, I put. 1. ſecondly, I double 643. and they make. 1286. and righte againſte hym behinde the line I put. 2.
                  Thirdly, vnto that ſame. 1286. I adde the diuiſor. 643. and thei are 1929. and right againſte the ſame I ſet. 3. Fourthly, vnto the ſaied 1929. I adde the diuiſor. 643. and thei are 2572. and right againſte the ſame I putte. 4. And thus muſt you dooe alwaies by encreaſyng ſo muche euery producte, as the diuiſor doeth amount vnto, vntill you haue ſo doen nine tymes, as you ſee in this preſent table.
                  This beyng dooen, you muſte ſette downe your diuiſor vnder the diuidende, after the ſame maner as is before declared: that is to ſaie. 643. vnder

the three firſte figures of the diuidende, towarde your righte hande, which are. 789: Then muſt you ſeke how many times. 643. are conteined in. 789: And for to knowe the ſame, I looke in my foreſaied table, if I maie there finde the ſame nombers. 789. the whiche is not there: The refore I muſt take a leſſer nomber, the nereſte to it in quantitie, that I can finde in the table, the whiche is. 643. whiche nomber hath againſte it on the righte hande of the line this diget. 1. Then I take the ſaid. 1. and I put it behind the croked line, for the firſte figure of the quotiente.
                  Then I doe abate. 643. from. 789 and there remaineth. 146. the which I putte ouer the. 789. and I cancell the. 789. and thus is the firſte operacion ended. Then I ſette forewarde the diuiſour, one figure nerer to my right hande, and I ſeeke a newe quotient, as I ſought this, where I finde the higher number ouer my diuiſour

to bée. 1464. The whiche I doe ſeeke in the table, and becauſe I can not finde it there, I take a leſſer number, the nigh
                        •
                     ſt to it that I can finde, and that is. 1286: whiche number hath againſte it this digette. 2. I putte. 2. for the ſeconde figure of the quotient behinde the line, and I dooe abate. 1286. from. 1464. and there remaineth. 178
                  Thirdly, I remone forward the diuiſor, as before, and I finde the higher number to be. 1786. and that the next leſſer number to it in my table, is againe. 1286. I putte the refore ones againe. 2. in the quotient for the thirde figure: and I abate. 1286. from. 1786. and there remaineth. 500.
                  Fourthly, I ſet forward the diuiſor and the higher nūber ouer it, is. 5005 and the next leſſer number to it in my table is. 4501. right againſt the which noumber is. 7. I putte. 7. in the quotiente, for the fowerth figure. And after that I haue abated. 4501. from 5005. there remaineth. 504.
                  
                     
Finally, I remoue forward my diuiſor vnto the laſte place: and I finde the higher number to bee. 5048. And the nexte leſſer noumber to it in my table, is. 4501. I ſette. 7. againe in the quotient, for the fifte and laſte figure. Then I take. 4501. from. 5048. and there remaineth. 547. whiche muſt be put at the ende of the whole quotieute with the diuiſor vnder it, and a line betwene them, in this maner folowing.

               ¶ Of progreſsion, the vi. Chapiter.
               
               
                  PRogreſſion Arithmeticall, Progreſſion Arithmeticalle. is a brief and ſpedie aſſemblyng, or addyng together of diuers figures or numbers, euery one ſurmountyng thother continually, by equall difference: as 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. &amp;c. here the diffrence, from the firſt to the ſeconde is but of 1. and ſo do al the other, euery one excede an other by. 1. ſtill to thende. Like waies. Here 2. 4. 6. 8. &amp;c. doe proceade by the difference of. 2. alſo. 3. 6. 9. 12. &amp;c. doe euery one differ from other by. 3. and ſo may theſe nūters continue. Infinitty after this order, in addyng vnto the thirds number, the quantitie wherein the ſecōde doth differ frō the firſt: like wates

addyng the ſame difference vnto the fowerth number, alſo to the fifte, and ſo vnto all the other. As. 14. the difference of the ſeconde to the firſte is. 3: adde. 3. vnto. 4: and thei are. 7. for the thirde number: Then adde. 3. vnto. 7: and thei make. 10. for the fowerth nū
                  ber, and ſo of all other.
               Then if you will adde quickly the number of any progreſſion, you ſhall doe thus, firſte tell how many numbers there are, and write their ſomme doune by it ſelf, as in this example, 2. 5. 8. 11. 14. where the numbers are 5 as you maie ſee, therefore you muſte ſette doune. 5. in a place alone, as I 5. haue dooen here in the margent.
               Then ſhall you adde the firſt number, and the laſte together, whiche in this example are. 14. and. 2. and thei make. 16. take halfe thereof, whiche is. 8. and multiplie it by the. 5. whiche I noted in the margente, for the nomber of the places, and the ſomme whiche amounteth of that multyplication,

is the iuſte ſomme of all thoſe figures added together, as in this example: 8. multiplied by. 5. dooe make. 40. and that is the ſomme of al the figures.
               An other example of parcelles that are euen, as thus. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. in this exāple you muſt likewaies note doun the number of the places, as before is taught, and thē adde together the laſt nomber and the firſt. And the ſomme whiche commeth of that additiō, ſhall you multiplie by halfe the nomber of the places, whiche before are noted, and that, whiche reſulteth of the ſame multiplication, is the whole ſomme of al thoſe figures, as in this former exā
                  ple, where the nomber of the places is 6. I note the 6. apart, and then I adde 6. 6. and 1. together, whiche are the laſte and firſte nombers, and thei make. 7. the whiche I multiplie by. 3. whiche is halfe the nomber of places, and thei make. 21. and ſo muche amounteth all thoſe figures added together.
               
                  
Progreſſion Geometricall is, when Progreſſion. geometricall. the ſecond nomber containeth the firſt in any proporcion. 2. 3. or. 4. times and ſo forthe. And in like proporcion ſhall the thirde nomber contain the ſecond, and the fowerth, the third, and the firſt the fowerth. &amp;c. As. 2. 4. 8. 16. 32. 64. here the proportion is double.
               Likewaies. 3. 9. 27. 81. 243. are in triple proportion.
               And. 2. 8. 32. 128. 512. are in proporcion quadruple.
               That is to ſaye, in the firſte example, where the proporcion is double, euery nomber containeth the other. 2. tymes. In the ſeconde example of triple proporcion, the noumbers exceade eche other thre times. And in the third example, the nombers exceade eche other fower times, and thus you ſe that progreſſion Arthmeticalle, differeth from Progreſſion Geometricalle for that, that in y• Arithmeticall. The exceſſe is only in quātitie, but in the Geometricall, the exceſſe is in proporcion.
               
                  
Nowe if you will eaſelie finde the ſomme of any ſoche nombers, you ſhal dooe thus, conſider by what noumber thei be multiplied, whether by. 2. 3. 4. 5. or any other, and by the ſame nomber you muſt multiply the laſt ſomme in the progreſſion. And from the producte of the ſame multiplication, you ſhall abate the firſt nomber of the progreſſion. And that whiche remaineth of the ſaied multiplicacion, you ſhall diuide by. 1. leſſe then was the nomber, by the which I did multiplie. And the quotient ſhall ſhew you the ſōme of all the nombers in any Progreſſion. As in this exaumple. 5. 15. 45. 135. 405. whiche are in triple proporcion: now muſte you multiplie. 405. by. 3. and thei are. 1215. from the which you ſhal abate the firſt nomber of the progreſſion, whiche is. 5. and there reſteth 1210. the whiche you ſhall diuide by the nōber leſſe by. 1. then by the which you did multiplie, that is to ſaie, by. 2. and you ſhall finde in the quociēt 605.

whiche is the totall ſomme of the nō
                  bers of that progreſſion. Likewiſe. 4. 16. 64. 256. 1024. whiche are in proportion quadruple: therfore multiplie 1024. by. 4. and thereof commeth 4096. from the whiche abate the firſt nomber. 4. and there reſteth. 4092: the whiche you muſt deuide by. 3. and you ſhall finde in your quotient. 1364 whiche is the total ſomme of that progreſſion, and this ſhalbe ſufficient for progreſſion.
            
            
               ¶ The .vij. Chapiter treateth of the Rule of. 3. called the golden Rule.
               
                  THE rule of three is the chiefeſt, the moſte profitable, and the moſte excellente rule of all the rules of Arithmetike. For al other rules haue nede of it, and it paſſeth all the other, for the whiche cauſe it is ſaied, that the Philoſophers did name it the golden rule. And after others opinion and iudgemente, it is

called the rule of proportions of nombers. But now in theſe daies, by vs it is called the rule of thrée, be cauſe it requireth three nombers in his operacion. Of the whiche three nombers, the twoo firſt are ſet in a certain proportion. And in ſuche proportion as thei be ſtabliſhed, this rule ſerueth to finde out vnto the third nomber, the fourth nomber to hym proportioned, in ſuche ſort as the ſeeonde is proportioned vnto the firſte. Not for that, that the fower noumbers, nor yet the three, are or bee proportionall, or ſet in one proportion, but ſuche proportion, as is from the firſte to the ſeconde, ought to bee from the thirde vnto the fowerth, that is to ſate, if the ſeconde noumber dooe contain the firſte, twoo tymes or more, ſo many tymes ſhall the fourth nomber containe the thirde. And note well that the firſte noumber, and the thirde in euery rule of three, oughte and muſt bee alwaies ſemblable, and of one condition. And the ſecond nomber,

and the fowerth muſte likewiſe bee of one ſemblaunce and nature.
               And are diſſemblaunte, and contrarie to the other twoo noumbers: that is to ſaie to the firſte, and the thirde. And if you dooe multiplie the firſte by the fowerth. And the ſeconde noumber by the thirde. The twoo multiplications will bee egall. Likewiſe if you diuide the one ſembleaunte by the other, that is to ſaie, the thirde noumber by the firſte. And likewiſe the one diſſembleaunt by the other: that is to ſaie, the fowerth nomber by the ſecond (which are diſſembleaunt to the other twoo nombers) your twoo quocientes will be egall
               The ſtile of this rule in thus, you Regul. muſte ſette doune your three noumbers in a certaine order, as by example here vnder ſhal appeare. And then multiplie the thirde noumber, by the ſeconde. And the producte thereof you muſt diuide by the firſte noumber, or otherwiſe, diuide the firſte noumber

by the ſeconde. And the quocient therof ſhalbee diuiſor alſo vnto the third nōber that is to ſaie, the thirde nomber ſhall bee diuided by the quotient of the foreſaied diuiſion, that is of the firſte noumber diuided by the ſeconde. Or otherwiſe diuide the ſecond noumber by the firſte. And that whiche cōmeth into your quotiente, you ſhall multiplie it by the thirde nomber. And thus ſhall you haue the fowerth noumber, whiche you ſeke for.
               
                  ¶ Example.
                  IF, 8. be worthe. 12. what are 14. worth after the rate, or els if. 8. require. 12. for his proportionall, what will. 14. demaunde? The whiche three noumbers maie conuenientlie bee ſette in ſoche order, as hereafter doeth appere.
                  If. 8.-12.-14. multiplie the thirde nomber. 14. by the ſeconde, whiche is. 12. And thereof commeth

(for the whole producte of this multiplication. 168. the whiche (as the rule teacheth) you muſte diuide by the firſt nomber, that is to ſaie by. 8. and therof commeth. 21. And ſo muche are the 14. worthe. This is the waie, whiche is moſte vſed.
                  Otherwiſe diuide. 8. by. 12. whiche you can not doe, for thei are 8/72. wherefore abreuie. 8/12. and thei are 2/9. for your quotient, then diuide the thirde nomber. 14. by the ſaied ⅖, and you ſhall haue. 21. as before. Orels diuide the ſeconde nomber. 12. by the firſte nomber. 8. thereof commeth. 1 ½. the whiche 1 ½ you ſhall multiplie by 14. and therof will come. 21. as is aboue ſaied, and thus muſte you dooe of all other. And although, that the nōbers of this rule maie bee founde in three differences, for ſometymes thei are whole nombers and broken together, ſometymes broken and broken together, and ſomtymes all whole nombers, if thei bee whole nombers, you muſte doe none

otherwiſe, then you did in the laſt erā
                     ple. But in caſe thei be broken noumbers, or broken and whole noumbers together, the maner and waie to dooe theim, recetueth a certaine variacion, and difficultee, according to the varietie of the noumbers, the whiche operation eaſeiy to do, and vnuariable, this rule teacheth.
                  The three noumbers beyng ſotte doune, according vnto the order of the whole noumbers aforeſaied, without any broken nomber, let. 1. bee put alwaies vnderneath euery whole nomber, with a line betwene them fractiō wiſe, as thus 8/1. and that. 1. is denominatour to euery ſoche whole nomber. When you haue whole nomber and broken, thei muſt bee reduced and added with their broken nomber, and if there bée broken nomber without any whole nomber, theſame broken muſt remain in their eſtate.
               
               
                  A Rule.
                  This beynge deen, you ſhall multiplie

the denominatour of the firſte nomber, by the numeratour of the ſecond, and the producte thereof againe by the numerator of the third nōber. And ſo ſhall you haue the diuidende, or nomber whiche muſte bee diuided, then multiplie the numeratour of the firſt nōber, by the denominator of the ſeconde, and the product thereof by the denominator of the third nomber, and that which cōmeth of this multiplication ſhalbe your diuiſor. Then diuide the nomber, whiche is to bee diuided, by the diuiſour, and you ſhall finde the fowerth nomber that you ſeke. Of the which maner and faſhions of the rule of. 3. are diuers kindes, wherof the firſt is of. 3. whole nombers, as was the laſt example, and here foloweth the ſecond

And here you muſte marke that the firſt nōber &amp; the thirde in this queſtiō be of one denominaciō, and like wiſe the ſecond &amp; the fowerth which you haue found are of one ſemblaunce: but in caſe that the firſt nomber and the third in any queſtion: bee not of like denominacion, you muſte in workyng bryng them into one, as in this exāple folowing. If. 12. nobles do gaine me 6. nobles, how many nobles wil. 48. poundes gatne me: Here you ſe that y• denominaciō of the firſt

nomber is nobles, and the denominacion of the thirde, is poundes, wherefore, before you doe procede to worke by the rule of three, you muſte firſte turne the poūdes into nobles in multipliyng. 48. poundes by three nobles and they make. 144. nobles, for that there is in euery pounde of money. 3. nobles, or otherwiſe if you will, you maie bryng the firſt nomber beyng. 12 nobles, into poundes, by diuiding thē by. 3. and thus ſhal your firſt and third nombers, bee brought into one denominacion. Then ſhal you ſette doune your. 3. nombers in order thus.
                  If. 12. nobles doe gaine me. 6. nobles, what ſhall. 144. nobles gaine? the which. 144. are the nobles which are in. 48. 
                        〈◊〉
                     . Then multiplie the third nomber. 144. by the ſeconde nomber 6. and thereof cometh 864. the whiche you muſte diuide by. 12. nobles, and thereof commeth. 72. nobles.
                  But here it maie perchaunce make ſome menne maſſe, to ſee all the three

nombers in this rule of three, to bee of one denomination, whiche can not otherwiſe bee dooen, if you reduce the third nomber, to the denominacion of the firſte. But if you will reduce the firſte nomber, to the denomination of the thirde, that is to ſaie the. 12. nobles into poundes, then ſhall the firſte and the third nombers onely agree in one denominacion, and the fowerth nomber which you ſeke, ſhalbe of the ſame denominacion as is the ſeconde, as in the former example. If. 12. nobles doe yelde me. 6. nobles, what will. 48. poundes yeld me: firſt you ſhall diuide 12. nobles by three to bryng theim in poundes, and thei ſhall bee like to the thirde nomber, whiche is alſo poundes, then will thei ſtande thus.

There is yet a more exacte waie to woorke in this rule of three, whiche is thus. You muſte marke if the third &amp; firſt nombers in the rule of three, maie bee bothe diuided by one like diuiſor: the which after you haue diuided thē, you ſhall write doune eche of the quocientes orderly, in the ſaied rule of. 3. euery one of theim in his owne place, as though thoſe were twoo of the nō
                     bers of your queſtion, and not chaungyng the middle noumber, that is to ſaie the ſeconde, as thus, if. 50. Croudes doe buye me. 44. yardes of clothe, howe manye yardes ſhall I haue for 120, here you maye ſee that the thirde and the firſte nombers, maie be diuided by. 10. whiche in the thirde nomber is. 12. tymes, and in the firſte. 5. times. Wherefore you ſhall put. 12. for the thirde nomber in the rule of three▪ in ſtede of 120. and 5. for the firſt nomber in ſtede of 50. and let. 44. remain ſtill in the middeſt for the ſecond nomber, after this ſorte as foloweth, and

then worke by the rule as before.

                  Multiplie. 44. by. 12. and thereof commeth. 528. diuide theſame. 528. by 5. and you ſhall finde in your quocient 105. ⅕. and euē ſo many yardes ſhould you haue founde, if you had wrought the rule of thre, by the firſt nōbers propoſed. There is yet certaine other varieties, in woorkinge by the rule of three, but for that they require the knowledge of fractions, and becauſe thei are not ſo eaſte as this firſt waie, whiche is common, therefore content your ſelues with this ſame, vntil you haue taſted the fractions, the whiche by gods helpe I intende to fet forth in ſeconde part of this boke, incontinently after that I haue firſte taught you

the backer rule of three.
                  The backer rule of thre is ſo called: becauſe it requireth a contrary woorkyng to that, whiche doeth the rule of three directe, where of wee haue nowe treated. For in the directe rule of three the greater the thirde noumber is, ſo moche the greater will the fourth be. But here in this backer rule it is contrariwiſe, for the greater the third nō
                     ber is, ſo moche leſſer wil the fowerth bee. Then, where as in the rule of. 3. directe, the third noumber is multiplied by the ſeconde, and the producte thereof diuided by the firſte. Here you muſte multiplie the ſeconde noumber by the firſte, and diuide the producte of the ſame by the third, and the nomber whiche commeth in the quotiente, anſwereth to the queſtiō. For ſuche practiſe commeth often tymes in vſe: In ſuche ſorte, that if you woorke theſame by the rule of three directe (not hauyng a regarde vnto the Propoſition of the queſtion) you ſhould then

committe an euidente and open errour.

                  ber aboue the line, is called the numerator, and. 4. whiche is vnder the line is called the denominator. And it is al waies conuenient, that the numerator

be leſſe in nomber, then the denominator. For if the numerator, and the denominator were egall in value: then ſhould thei repreſente a whole nomber, thus, as 1/1, 2/2, 3/3, whiche are whole nombers: by reaſon that the numerators of theſe, and al ſuche like maie bee diuided by their denominators, and their quotiētes will alwaies be but. 1. But in caſe that y• numerator do excede his denominator, then it is more then I whole: as 20/18, is more thā a whole nomber by 2/18, other diffinition dooeth not hereunto appertaine. Furthermore it is to bée vnderſtande, that the middeſt of all broken nombers, is the iuſte halfe of. 1. whole, as 5/12, 7/14, 8/16, 9/18 and other like, are the halfes of one whole nomber, wherof doeth growe, and come forthe 2. progreſſions natural: the one progrediyng by augmentyng, or encreaſyng, as theſe.

And thei doe proceade infinitely, and wil neuer reche to make a whole nomber, thus 1/1. And the other progreſſion, dooeth progrede by diminiſhyng or decreaſyng, as thus.
               ½ ⅓ ¼ ⅕ ⅙ 1/7 ⅛ 1/9 1/10 &amp;c.
               And theſe dooe proceade infinitely, and ſhall neuer come to make a. ○. whiche ſignifieth nothyng, but ſhall euer reiaine ſome certaine nomber whatſoeuer, whereby it doeth appere that broken nombers are infinite.

                  REduction, is as muche as to bryng together, or to put in ſembleaunce, twoo or many noumbers diſſembling one from the other, in reducyng

them vnto a common denominator. For bicauſe the diuerſitie and difference of the broken numbers, doe come of the denominators part, or of diuers denominators, and for the vnderſtanding hereof, there is a general rule whoſe operation is thus. Multiple the Denominators the one by the other, and ſo you ſhall haue a new denominator cōmon to al, the whiche denominator diuide by the perticuler denominators, and multiplye euerie quotiēt by his numerator and ſo you ſhall haue newe numerators, for the numbers whiche you woulde reduce, as appeareth by thys example followyng.

                  If you will reduce ½, ⅔, ¾, ⅚, together, you muſt multiplie all the denominators, the one by the other, that is to ſaie, 2. by. 3. maketh. 6. then. 6. by 4. and mounteth. 24.

               ¶ The thirde Chapter treateth of abbreuiation of one greate broken number into a leſſer broken.
               
                  ABbreuiation is aſmuch as to ſet downe, or to write a brokē nūber by figures of leſſe ſignification, &amp; not diminiſhing y• value thereof. The whiche to doe, there is a rule whoſe operation is thus, diuide the numerator and likewiſe the denominator, by one whole number, the greateſt yt you maye fynde in the ſame broken number, and of the quotient of that numerator, make it the numerator, and likewiſe of that of the denominator, make it your denominator, as by example.
               1. If you wyl abbreuiat 54/8
                     •
                  , you ſhal vnderſtande that the greateſt whole number that you maye take, by the which you maye diuide the numerator &amp; denominator is 27, which is the half of y• numerator, &amp; that is a whole number, for you can not take a whole

number oute of the denominator. 81. but that there will bee either more or leſſe than a whole number, therefore if you diuide 54. by 27. you ſhall 
                     〈 math 〉
                   finde 2. for the numerator, likewiſe if you diuide 81. by 27. you ſhall finde 3. for the denominator. then put. 2. ouer the 3. with a line betwene thē, and you ſhall find ⅔ and thus by this rule the 53/81 are abreuted vnto ⅔, as appeareth in the margent, and ſo is to be vnderſtande all other.
               ¶ The forme &amp; maner how to finde oute the greater number, by the which you mai wholy diuide, y• numerator &amp; denominator (to thende yt you may abreuiat them) is thus.
               
                  
Firſt, diuide the denominator by hys numerator, and if anye number doe remaine, let your diuiſor be diuided by the ſame number, and ſo you muſt continue vntill you haue ſo diuided y• there maye nothing remaine, then is it to be vnderſtande, that your laſt diuiſor (wherat you did ende, and that o did remaine after your laſt diuiſion) is the greateſt number, by the whiche you muſt abreuiat, as you did in the laſte example, but in caſe that your laſt diuiſor be 1. it is a token that the ſame nūber can not bee abreuied. Example, of 54/81 diuide 81. (whiche is the denomination) by 54. which is his numerator, and there reſteth 27. then diuide 54. by 27. and there remaineth nothinge, wherefore your laſt diuiſor 27. is the number, by the whiche you muſt abreuiat 54/81 as in the laſte example is ſpecifyed.
               
                  ¶ An other ſtile of abbreuiation.
                  
                     
2. Mediate the numerator, and alſo the denominator of your fraction in caſe the noumbers be euen, that is to ſaye, take alwayes the halfe of the numerator, and likewiſe of the denominator, and of the mediatiō or halfe of the numerator, make the numerator, alſo of ½ the denominator, make your denominator, and ſo continue as often as you may in takinge alwayes the ½ of the numerator, and ſemblablie of the denominator, or els ſee if you may abbreuiate the numbers which doe remaine, by 3. by 4. by 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. or by 10. for you muſt abbreuiate them as often as you can by any of the ſaide numbers, and it is to bée noted, that with whatſoeuer number of theſe, you doe abbreuiate the Numerator of your Fraction, by the ſame you muſte abbreuiate likewyſe the Denominator, ſo continuynge vntil they can no more bee abbreuied. And it is to bee vnderſtande that if the Numerator and the Denominator

be euen numbers, as you maye know when the fyrſte fygure is an euen nūber, or a 
                        〈◊〉
                     , thē maye you perceaue if both the Numerator and the Denominator may be abbreuied by 10. by 8 by 4. or by 2. although yt ſome times they maye bee abbreuied by three.
                  And if they be odde numbers, then muſte you conſider if they maye bee abbreuied by 9. by 7 by. 5. or by 3: but when the firſt number, as well of the Numerator, as of the Denominator are euen numbers, then may you well knowe that ſuche numbers maye bee abbreuied be 2. as is aforeſaide. And if you adde the fygures of the Numerator togither, in ſuche manner as you doe in makynge the proofe by nyne in whole Numbers: that is, if you fynde 9. 
                        〈◊〉

                      that number by 9. And lykewiſe by 3. and ſometimes by 6. if you fynde 6. it maye bee abbreuied by 6. and

alwaies by 3. if you finde 3. it is a ſigne that you may abreuiate by 3. And by whatſoeuer nomber that you doe abreuiate the numerator, by the ſame muſt you abreuiate likewiſe the denominator, and if the firſt figures of the ſame nomber be. 5. or 0. you maye abreuiate them by 5. but if the firſte fygures be both 0. they may be abreuied by 10. in cutting awaye the twoo Cyphers thus, as 
                        〈◊〉
                      whiche maketh 2/

                  3. Furthermore you ſhall vnderſtande that ſometimes it happeneth, that all the fygures of the numerator are egall vnto them of the denominator, which when it ſo happeneth, you maye thē take one of them of the numerator, and alſo one of them of the denominator, and it ſhall bee abreuyed as 555/888, beinge abreuiated after this maner commeth to ⅝. And yet it happeneth ſometimes, that two, or manye fygures of the numerator are proportioned vnto two, or many fyguree

of their denominators and the other fygures of the ſame number doe beholde the one the other in thys proportion? Then may you take twoo or many fygures, as well of the numerator as of the denominator, and by this maner the ſame number ſhall bee abbreuied, as 4747/

               FOr to adde broken numbers togither, there is a generall rule, which is thus, if the nū
                  bers be vnlike yt one to the other, you muſt reduce thē into a cōmō denomination, whiche after you haue reduced thē, you muſt then adde both y• numerators togither, &amp; ſet y• product of the ſaide addition ouer the croſſe, &amp; diuide the ſame by the common denominator, as by this exāple folowinge.
               
                  
1. If you wyll adde ⅔ wyth ¾, you muſte fyrſt reduce the twoo fractions bothe into one denomination, accordinge to the introduction of the fyrſte reduction, that is to ſaye, in multiplyinge the denominator of the firſte fraction whiche is 3, by the denominator of the other fraction whiche is foure, and they make 12. for your common denominator,

                   the which 12. ſet vnder the croſſe, thē multiplie yt fyrſt numerator 2. by the laſt denominator 4. and thereof commeth 8. whiche ſett ouer the ⅔, and then multiply y• laſt numerator 3. by the fyrſte denominator 3. and therof commeth 9. whiche you muſt ſet ouer the ¾, then adde the numerator 8. with the numerator 9. &amp; they make 17. which ſet ouer the croſſe, and then your fraction wyll be 17/12 whiche is the addition of the ⅔ wyth ¾. And bycauſe

your numerator 17. is greater thā his denominator 12. therfore you muſt diuide 17. by 12. and thereof will come 1. and 5. remaining, which 5. are worth

               NOte, that in diuiſion of broken nombers, you muſte ſette

your diuiſor downe firſte, nexte vnto the lefte hande, and the diuidende or nomber, whiche is to bee diuided alwaies towarde the right hande.
               And then multiplie croſſe wiſe, that is to ſaie, the numeratour of youre Diuiſour by the Denominator of the Diuidende, and the producte ſhalbee the Denominatour, whiche afterwarde ſhall bee your Diuiſour. And likewiſe you muſte multiplie the Denominatour of your firſte noumber, that is to ſaie of your Diuiſour: By the Numeratour of the Diuidende, whiche afterwarde ſhall bee the Diuidende, and that muſte bee ſette ouer the Croſſe, and the Denominatour vnder the Croſſe, then ſhall you diuide the Numeratour by the Denominatour, if any maie bee diuided, if not, you muſte abreuiate theim, as hereafter by examples ſhall more plainly appeare.
               1. If you will diuide ¾. by ⅔, you muſte ſette the Diuiſour (whiche is

⅖) nexte to the lefte hande, and the diuidende ¾. towarde your right hande, with a croſſe betwene them: as maie appere by this example in the margente. Then

Then finally, you ſhall diuide. 9. by. 8. and thereof commeth into the quotient. 1. 2/8 and ſo often times is ⅔. conteined in ¾, as dooeth appeare before in the margente. But in caſe you would diuide ⅔. by. ¾, you muſte likewiſe ſette your

diuiſor ¾ nexte to your left hande, as is before ſaid. And then procede, as is aboue declared, &amp; you ſhall finde that ⅔ diuided by ¾ bringeth into ye quotiēt 2/9, whiche can not be diuided nor abbreuied, wherfore it appereth that ⅔ diuided by ¾ bringeth but 2/9 of one vnitie into the quotient as doth appere.

ſet that vnder ye croſſe &amp; multiply 3. by 1. which is 3. for the numerator, that ſet ouer the croſſe, and it is 3/52 as appeareth in the margent. But if you will diuide 13. by ¾ then ſet the ¾ nexte your left hand and put one vnder 13. as in the laſt example, &amp; it is

                  ber by whole number and broken, or els whole nūber and broken by whole number, as to diuide 20. by 5. ⅚, you ſhall reduce 5. ⅚ into his broken by ye ſixt reduction, &amp; it maketh 35/

                   for your

                   35. by 1. and 20. by 6. as is taught in the other diuiſions, and you ſhall finde 220/3: then diuide 12. by 35. and you ſhall fynde in your quotient 3. 3/

               But if you will diuide 5. 3/6 by 20. you muſt diuide 35. by 120. which you can not, wherefore you ſhall abbreuiate 35/120, and thereof commeth. 7/24.
               4. If you will diuide a broken number by whole number and broken, or els a whole number and broken, by a broken number. As to diuide ¾ by 13. ⅔, you muſte reduce 13. ⅔, into hys broken, by the ſyxte reduction

And they be 41/3 for your diuiſor, then multiplye 41. by 4. &amp; they make 164. for your denominator, likewiſe multiplye 3. by 3. and they make 9. for the numerator, and then will your ſūme be 9/104. But yf you will diuide 13. ⅔ by ¾ then you muſt diuide 164. by 9. and you ſhall fynde 18. 2/9.
               5. If you will diuide whole number and broken, by whole number &amp; broken, as to diuide 7. ¾ by 13. ⅔ you muſt reduce the whole numbers into their broken, by the doctrine of the ſixt reduction, &amp; you ſhall fynde 31/4 for the 7. ¾, &amp; 41/3 for the 13. ⅔. Then ſett downe 41/3 towarde

                     〈◊〉
                   as before

doth appere.
               But if you will diuide 13⅔. by 7. ¾ you muſte contrariwyſe to the other example, diuide 164. by 93. and you ſhall fynde in the quotient 1. 71/93.
               6. The broken numbers of broken, muſte be diuided in ſuche maner as broken numbers are, &amp; there is no difference, ſauing onely that of many broken numbers you muſt make but two broken numbers, that is to ſaye ye diuiſor, and the diuidend, or number that is to be diuided, example. If you will diuide the ¾ of ⅗ of ½, by the 2/2 of 4/7. For the fyrſt, the ¾ of ⅗ of ½ are 9/4. by the thirde reduction: and the ⅔ of 4/7 are by the ſame Reductiō 8/21, then haue you 8/21 for your 
                     〈 math 〉
                   diuiſor, &amp; 9/40 for your nū
                  ber to bee diuided, then multiply 8. by 40. which maketh 320. ſet that vnder the croſſe and multiply 9. by 21: &amp; thereof cōmeth 189. which ſet ouer the croſſe for the numerator, and they

make 189/120 for this diuiſion as doth appere.
               But if you woulde diuide 1/21 by 9/200. you muſt worke contrary to the laſte example, that is to ſaye, you muſt diuide 320. by 189. And therof commeth in the quotient 1. 131/189.
            
            
               ¶ The eyght Chapter treateth of duplation, triplation, and quadruplation of all broken numbers.
               IF you wyll double any broken number, you ſhall diuide ye ſame by½: likewiſe if you wyll triple any fraction you muſte diuide it by ⅔. And for to quadruple any broken nū
                  ber, you ſhall diuide it by ¼, and ſo is to be vnderſtande of all other.
               
                  Example of duplation.
                  IF you will double ⅜ you ſhal diuide 3/
                        •

                      are ¾: as by example.
                  
                     
Or otherwiſe, in caſe the denominator of any fraction bee an euen number, you may take halfe the ſayde denominator, without anye other operation, and the numerator to abyde ſtill ye numerator, vnto the ſaid halfe of the denominator of the Fractiō, as by the other exāple before rehearſed: that is to ſay of

But in caſe the denominator bee an odde nomber, that is to ſay, not euen, then you may multiply the numerator by 2. or els double ye numerator, whiche is al one thing; and that fraction ſhall bee doubled. Example, if you will double

                   rules, for that by thē many queſtions maie be doen with quicker expeditiō, then by the rule of thre. There bée others, whiche call them the ſmall multiplication, for becauſe that the producte, is alwaies leſſe in quantitie, then the nomber whiche is to be multiplied. This practiſe commeth not in vſe, but onely emong ſmall kindes of nombers, whiche haue ouer theim, other nombers that are greater. And this beyng well conſidered, is no other thyng, but to conuerte leſſer and perticuler kindes of nōber, into greater, the whiche maie bee dooen by the

meanes of diuiſion, in taking the half, the third, the fowerth, the fift, or ſuche other partes of the ſomme, whiche is to bee multiplied, as the multiplier is part of his greater kinde, &amp; that which commeth thereof is worthe as muche (not in quantitie, but in his owne forme) as if you did multiplie ſimplie the twoo ſommes, the one by thother, and for the better vnderſtandyng of ſuche conuerſions, you muſt haue reſpecte to one of theſe twoo conſiderations. The firſt is, when one would demaunde this queſtion. At 6. pence the yarde of Cotton, what are. 18. yardes worth by the price? It is manifeſt that thei are worthe. 18. peeces of. 6. pence the pece, or. 18. halfe ſhillynges, which muſt be tourned into ſhillynges, in takyng the halfe of. 18. ſhillynges, and thei make. 9. ſhillinges. Or otherwiſe you muſte conſider, that at. 1 ſhillyng the yarde, the. 18. yardes are worth. 18. ſhillynges, wherefore at. 6. pence thei ſhalbe but halfe ſo muche, for. 6. pence

is but the ½ of. 1. ſhiliyng. Therefore you muſt take ½ of. 18. and thei make 9 ſhillinges, whiche are worth as much as. 108. pence, that is to ſaie, as. 18. times. 6. pence.
               2. Firſte, if you will multiplie any nomber, after this maner by pence, whereof the nomber of theſame pence doe not extende vnto. 12. and therof to bryng ſhillinges into the product: you muſt knowe the certaine partes of. 12 whiche are theſe: that is to ſaie, 6, 4. 3. 2. and. 1. For. 6. is the ½ of. 12. and. 4. is the

                  . of. 12: 3. is the ¼: 2 is the ⅙: and 1. is the. 
                     •
                  /12. Then for. 6. pence, whiche is the halfe of. 1. ſhillyng, you muſt take the ½ of all the nomber, whiche is to be multiplied. And that which commeth thereof, ſhalbe ſhillynges, if there do remaine. 1. it is. 6. pence.
               For fower pence you muſt take the 
                     •
                  /4 of all the nomber, that is to bée multiplied: and if any vnities doe remaine thei ſhalbe thirdes of a ſhillyng, euery one beyng in value. 4. pence.
               
                  
For. 3. pence you muſte take the, ¼. of all the ſomme: if any vnities dooe remaine, thei ſhall bee fowerthes of a ſhillyng, euery one beyng worthe three pence.
               For 2 pēce you muſt take the ⅙ of all the the ſomme, and if any vnities doe remaine, thei ſhall bee ſixe partes of a ſhillyng, beyng euery one of theim worthe twoo pence.
               For. 1. penie, take the 1/12 of the whole ſomme, if any vnities remaine, thei are. 12. partes of a ſhillyng, eche of them beyng in value. 1. penie, as by theſe examples folowing doeth plainly appeare.

Here you maie ſe in the firſt exāple, that. 59. yardes, at. 6. pence the yarde is worthe. 29. ſhillynges. 6. in taking the ½ of. 59. And in the ſeconde example, the. 82. yardes at. 4. pēce the yarde is worthe. 27. ſhillynges. 4. pence, in takyng the ⅓ of. 82.
               Likewiſe, in the third example. 97 yardes, at three pence the yarde, bringeeh. 24. ſhillynges. 3. pence, in takyng the ¼ of. 97. Alſo in the 
                     •

                   of. 346. And final-

in the fyft example. 343. yardes, at I. d. the yarde, amount to 28. ſhill. 7. d. in taking the 1/12 of 343. And ſo is to be done of all ſuche lyke, when the nomber of the pence, is any of the certaine partes of 12.
               But if the nomber of the pence be not a certain parte of 12. you muſte reduce them into ſome certaine partes of 12. and after the foreſayd maner you ſhall make two or three productes as neede ſhall require, and adde them togither into one ſumme as 5. d. may be reduced into 4. &amp; I. or els into 3. &amp; 2. wherfore if you wil work by 4. &amp; by I: you muſte for 4. d. take fyrſt the ⅓. of ye nomber, that is to bée multiplied, and for I. d. take the 1/12, or rather for I. d. you may take the ¼ of the producte whiche did come of the 4. d. bycauſe that I. d. is the ¼ of 4. d. But if you wyll worke by. 3. and you ſhal take for 3. d. the ¼ of the nomber whiche is to bee multiplied: and likewiſe for 2. d. the ⅙ of the ſame nomber, adding togyther both

the productes. The totall ſumme of thoſe two nombers ſhall be the ſolution to the queſtion. And in like maner is to be done of all other. As by theſe former folowyng may appeare.

               Otherwiſe for 7. d. take firſt the ½, of the whole ſūme for 6. d. Then for 1. d. take the ⅙ of the ſame product, and

adde them togither, ſo ſhall you haue the like ſumme as before.

                  /3 of the whole ſūme for 4. pence, and another

                   for other 4. d. and adde thē togither as in the. 3. example doth euidently appeare. Where the queſtion is thus, at 8. d. the yarde, what are 40 yardes worth? Firſte for 4. d. I take the ⅓ of 40. which is 13. s. 4. d. Againe, I take another ⅓ for the other 4 pence which is alſo 13. ſhillings &amp; 4. pence. Theſe twoo ſummes being added togither, do make 26. ſhillings 8. pence, and ſo muche are the 40. yards worth at 8. pence the yard, as in the third example aboueſayd doth appeare.
               Otherwayes, for eyght pence you may take firſt the ½ of the whole ſūme for 6. d. Then for 2. d. you ſhal take the 
                     •
                  /3 of the product, which did come of the ſaid ½, and adde them togither, ſo ſhall you haue likewiſe the ſolution to the queſtion. As in the ſame third exāple of 40. yardes, I take firſt the ½ of 40.

for 6. d. and thereof commeth 20. ſhil. then for 2. d. I take

               For 9. d. you muſt take the

Firſt for 6. d. I take the ½ of 73. and therof commeth 36. s. 6. d. then for 3. d. I take ½ of ye ſame 36. ſhil. 6. d. which is 18. s. 3. d. theſe twoo ſummes doe I adde togither, &amp; they make 54. ſhil. 9. d. as in ye ſaid fourth example is euident.
               For 10. d. take firſt the ½, then ye ⅓ of the whole ſumme, &amp; adde thē togither
               For 11.

               Or els for 11. d take firſt the ½ then then ⅓ of the whole ſumme, and finallye the ¼ of the laſte producte, addinge them togither.
               3. Lykewiſe by the ſame reaſon, when you wil multiply (by ſhillings) anye nomber that is vnder xx. s. you ſhall haue in the product poundes, if you knowe the certaine partes of 20: which are theſe. 10. 5. 4. 2. &amp;. 1. For 10. is the ½ of 20. 5. is the ¼ part: 4 is the ½. 2. is the 1/10: and 1. is the 1/20.
               Then for 10. s. which is the ½ of a pounde: you muſte take the 
                     •
                  /2 of the nomber, whiche is to bee multiplied, and you ſhal haue poundes in the product. If there doe remaine 1, it ſhalbe worth ten ſhillings.
               For 5. ſhillinges you muſte take the ¼ of the nomber whiche is to bee multiplied, &amp; if there do remaine any vnities, they ſhall be foure partes of

a poūd, euery one being in value 5. s.

               For 2. ſhillings you muſt take the 1/10 of the nōber that is to be multiplied. Wherefore, if you wyll take the 1/10 of any nomber, you muſte ſeparate the laſt figure of the ſame number whiche is nereſt your righte hande, from all

the other fygures. For all the other figures whiche doe remaine towarde your lefte hande, from the ſame fygure, which is ſeparated, ſhall bee the ſayde 1/1
                     •
                   of a pounde: and that ſeparated fygure, towarde your right hand ſhall be ſo many peeces of 2. ſhillings the peece: the whiche fygure muſt be doubled, to make therof ſhillings, as by theſe examples appeareth.

               Herevpō doth depend an other exact way for to multiply by ſhillings (if ye nomber of ſhillings be euen) which is thus: you ſhall take 
                     〈◊〉
                   the nōber of the ſame ſhillings, and conuert them into peeces of 2. ſhillings. Then by the

nomber of this halfe, you muſt firſte multiply the laſt figure towarde your right hande, of the nōber which is to be multiplied: And if ther be any tennes in the ſame product, thoſe muſt you reſerue in your minde: But if (wyth the ſame of els without the ſame) you doe finde any diget nomber, the ſame diget nomber ſhall you double, &amp; put it in the place of ſhillings: Then muſt you proceede to the multiplication of the other figures, adding vnto ye product the tennes whiche you before reſerued: and therof ſhall come pounds.
               Nowe, for your better vnderſtanding of this which hath bene ſaid and by the way of example, I will propone vnto you this queſtion.

                  . the groſſe, what are 97 groſſe? Firſt the ½ of 8. s. whiche is 4. s. being ſet apart behind the crooked line, as before is ſaid: thē I multiplye ye 97 by 4. ſaying firſt, 4. times 7. is 28. I double ye diget nūber 8. and

that maketh 16, the which 16, I do put vnder the line, in the place of ſhillings &amp; I kepe y• tennes in my mind, which here are 2. For 20. are two times ten: Then ſecondly, I multiply 9. by the ſayd 4, and thereof cōmeth 36: whervnto I adde the 2. tennes, whiche before I reſerued, and they make 38. Therfore I put 38, vnder the lyne in the place of poundes, and the whole ſumme will be 38 .li. 16. s. Thus much are the 97. groſſe worth, at eight ſhillings the groſſe: the like is to be done of all other. As of 12. ſhillings in multipliyng by 6. Likewiſe of 6. ſhillings if you multiply by 3. alſo of 14. if you multiply by 7. And ſo of all euen nombers after the ſame maner.
               For 1. Shilling you muſt take the ½ of the 1/10 parte of any nomber that is to be multiplied. And if any thyng 
                     〈 math 〉
                   do remaine, they are ſhil. Thus by thys maner ſhil.

are conuerted into poundes: for it is euen like, as if you did diuide thē by 20. s. as by this exāple in the margent doth appeare. Wher it is demaunded at 1. s. the yard, the peece, or any other thing, what are 350. worth?
               Firſt I ſeparate the laſte fygure of 359. nexte to my ryght hand, which is the 0 with a line betwene it and the figure 5. Then I make a line vnder the 3 |0, and I take the ½ of 35, after this maner: ſaiyng the ½ of 3. is I. and I remaineth, whiche remaine ſignifieth 10. in that ſecōd place. Then I put I. vnder the line againſt 3, &amp; I proceede to the reſt, ſaiyng: the halfe of 15. is 7. (which 15. came of the I. that remayned, and of the 5. in y• firſt place) I put 7. vnder the line right againſt 5, and they make 17 li. The I. which did laſt remaine, is 10. s. Therfore I put 10. s aparte vnder the line, and the whole ſumme is 17 .li. 19. s. ſo much are 350. worth at I. s. the peece.
               But when the nomber of ſhillings

is not ſome certaine parte of 20. ſhil. you muſt then conuert the ſame nomber of ſhillings, into the certain parts of 20. and make twoo or thrée products, as nede ſhall require, the whiche muſt bee added togither after this maner following.
               For 3. ſhillings you muſt firſte take for 2. ſhil. the 1/10 of the nomber that is to be multiplied, thē for 1. ſhilling you muſt take the ½ of the producte whiche did come of the ſame 1/10 part: and adde thoſe twoo ſūmes togither, as appeareth by this example following.
               At 3. s. the peece of any thing, what ſhall 684 peeces coſte mee after the rate. Firſt, for 2 ſhillings I take the 1/10 of 684, which is 68: in ſeparating the laſt 
                     〈 math 〉
                   figure 4, whiche 4 I muſt double, &amp; they be 8. I ſet eight ſhillings aparte from the place of poundes, and then I haue 68. poū
                  des 8. s. for the 1/10 parte, that is to ſay,

for the 2. s. ſecondlye, for 1. ſhil. I take the ½ of the product, that is to ſaye: of 68 .li. 8. s. whiche is 34 .li. 4. s. and I put the ſame vnder the 68 .li. 8. ſhil. Then finally, I adde thoſe two ſummes together, that is to ſaie, 68 .li. 8. s. and 34 .li. 4. ſhil. ſo they make 102 .li. 12. s. and ſo much are the 684. peeces worth at 3. ſhillings the peece, as may appere in the margent.
               For 6. ſhll. take 3/
                     ••
                   of the nomber whiche is to be multiplied: that is to ſay, firſt 1/10, then double the product of the ſame 1/10 and adde them together. Or otherwiſe for 4. s. take firſt ye ⅕ of ye nōber that is to be multiplied, then take the ½ of the product which is for two. s. and adde them togither.
               Or els take for 5. ſhill. the ¼ of the whole ſumme, then for 1. ſhil. the 1/
                     ••
                   of the product and adde them togither.
               Likewiſe for 7. ſhil. take firſte for 5. ſhil. the ¼ then for 2. ſhillings take the 1/10 of the nomber whiche is to be multiplied, and adde them togither.

For eyght ſhillings take the ⅖ at two ſundry times, that is to ſay, firſt ⅖ for 4. ſhil. and then as muche more for other 4. ſhil. and adde them togyther.
               For 9. ſhil. take firſt the ¼ and lykewiſe the ⅓ of the nomber that is to be multiplied, and adde them togither.
               For 11. ſhil. take firſt ½ for 10. s. Thē for 1. ſhil. take the 1/10 of the producte, &amp; adde them togither.
               For 12. ſhil. take firſt the ½ for 10. ſhil then for 2. s. take the ⅖ part of the product, and adde them togither,
               For 13. ſhil. take the ¼ then the ⅕, and againe another ⅕ of the nomber which is to be multiplied. And adde the productes togither, that is to ſaye: fyrſte for 5. ſhil. take the ¼, then for 4. ſhil. take the ⅕. And againe, another ⅕ for the other 4 ſhil. and aſſemble the three productes, the like is to be done of all others, when the price of the thynge which is valued, is onely of ſhillings. And as by theſe examples followyng doth plainly appeare.

4. Likewiſe in multipliyng by pēce you ſhall haue (at the firſte inſtaunte) poundes in the producte, in caſe you knowe the certaine partes of the 1/10 of a pounde, or of. 24. pence, whiche are theſe, 12. pence. 6. 4. 3. and. 2. For. 12. is the ½ of. 24:8. is the ⅕:6. is the ¼. 4. is the ⅙:3. is the ⅛:2. the 1/12: but for. 12. pence, whiche is 1. ſhillyng: wee haue before made mention thereof.
               For 8 pence you muſte take the ⅓ of the 1/10, and the reſte whiche are the peces of 8 pence, muſte bee doubled to make of them peeces of. 4. pence. And of the ſame nomber beyng doubled, you muſte take the ⅓, whiche will bee

ſhillynges, and if there doe yet remain any thing, thei are thirds of a ſhilling being in value 4 pence the pece.
               For 6 pence take the ¼ of the 1/12, and of that whiche remaineth, you muſte take the ½, whiche ſhall be ſhillynges, if there doe yet remaine. 1. it ſhall bee in value. 6. pence.
               For 4 pence you muſt take the ¼ of the 1/10, and of that whiche reſteth, take the ⅓ to make therof ſhillynges, if any thyng dooe yet remaine, thei are thirdes of a ſhillyng, beyng in value. 4. pence the pece.
               For 3 pence take the ⅕ of the 1/10, and of that whiche remaineth, take the ¼, to make of theim ſhillynges: if any thyng doe yet remaine, thei are fourethes of a ſhillyng, euery one of theim beyng worthe 3. pence.
               For 2 pence take the 1/12 of the 1/10: and of that whiche reſteth take the ⅙, the whiche are ſhi. if there do ſtill remain any thing, thei ſhalbe ſixte partes of a ſhilling, euery one being in value 2 d.
               
                  
For 1, penie it is impoſſible with eaſe, to bryng of pence, poundes (into the producte) vpon the totall ſomme: But firſte you muſt bryng them into ſhillinges by the order of the ſeconde rule of this chapiter, and then afterwarde you ſhall conuerte them into pounds, if nede ſo require. As by theſe examples followyng may appere. 
                     〈 math 〉
                  
               
               
                  
But if the number of pence, be not a certaine parte of 24. pence. Then muſt you bring them into the certain partes of 24. and make thereof diuers productes, which muſt be added together, as ſhall hereafter appeare.
               For. 5. pence you ſhall firſt take for 3. pence, then for. 2. pence, and adde thē together, accordyng to the inſtruction of the laſte rule. Or els firſte take for 4. pence, and then for. 1. penie.
               For. 7. pence, firſt take for. 4. pence then for. 3. d, and adde them together.
               For 9 pence, firſte take for 6 pence, then for 3 pence adoyng thē together.
               For. 10. pence, firſte take for 6. d. then for. 4. d, and adde them together.
               For. 11. pence take firſte for. 8. pence then for. 3. pence, and adde them together: as by theſe examples followyng doeth appeare.

                  
                     〈 math 〉
                  
               
               5. If you will multiplie any nōber by ſhillynges and pence, beyng bothe

together, you muſt take firſt for the. s. accordyng to the inſtructiō of the third rule of this chapiter, then take for the pence, after the order of the 
                     •
                  owerth rule before mentioned: but if there be any certaine partes of. 1. pounde, containyng bothe ſhillynges and pence, then for ſuche partes you ſhal take the like parte of the nomber that is to bee multiplied, as the nomber is part of 1 .li. the whiche certain partes are theſe, 6. s. 8. d: 3. s. 4. d: 2. s. 6. d: and. 1. s. 8. d: For 6. s. 8. d. is the ⅓ of a li. 3. s. 4. d. is the ⅙ of a li. 2. s. 6. d. is the ⅛: and 1. s. 8. d. is the 1/12: then for 6. s. 8. d. you muſte take the ⅓ of the nomber that is to bee multiplied: and if any thyng dooe remain, thei are thirdes of a pound, euery one being worthe 6 s. 8. pence. For 3. s. 4 d. you muſt take ye ⅙ if any thing doe remain, thei are 6 partes of a li. euery one beyng in valor 3. s. 4. d. For 2. s. 6. pēce, you muſt take the ⅛▪ if any thing be remainyng, the
                     •
                   are 8 partes of a li. euery one being worth 2.

                  . 6. d.
               
                  
For. 1. ſhillyng. 8. pence, you ſhall take the 
                     •
                  /12, if there dooe any thyng remaine, thei are twelfth partes of a .li. euery one beyng valued at. 1. s. 8. d. 
                     〈 math 〉
                  
               
               6. Here ſhall you accuſtome your ſelf, to multiplie by all ſortes of ſommes, beyng compounde of ſhillynges, and pence, whiche maie come to practiſe. As thus, for. 1. ſhillyng. 1. penie: for. 1. ſhillyng. 2. pence: for. 1. ſhillyng 3. pence: for. 1. ſhillyng 4. pence. Likewiſe for 2. ſhillynges 1. penie: 2. ſhilly. 2. pence: 2. ſhillynges. 3. pence. 2. s. 4. d And ſo of all other: conſideryng moreouer,

many ſubtile abreuiations, whiche happen oftentymes, that are eaſie to bee conceiued. As thus: at 11. s. 3. d. after that I haue taken firſte the ½ for 10. ſhillynges. Then for 1. ſhillyng. 3. pence. I take the ⅛ of the product, becauſe 1. ſhillyng. 3. pence is the ⅛ of 10 ſhillynges, in takyng theſaied ⅛ of the producte. And by this meanes, when ye haue taken one producte, ye maie oftentymes vpon the ſame, take an other more briefly, then vpon the ſōme that is to be multiplied, whiche thyng you muſt foreſée. 
                     〈 math 〉
                  
               
               
                  
7. But if you will multiplie, by poundes, ſhillinges &amp; pence being together. Firſte you muſte wholly multiplie by poundes. Then take for the ſhillyngs &amp; pēce, as in the. 5. rule of this chapiter is plainly declared. And as by theſe examples folowyng maie appeare. 
                     〈 math 〉
                  
               
               
                  
8. So theſe rules do ſerue, both to buy &amp; ſel, at ſuche a price the ell, the yard, y• pece, the li. waight or any other thing: how much ſuch a thing. Likewiſe thei are very neceſſary to conuert all peces of gold &amp; ſiluer into li. for I may aſwel ſaie, at. 4. s. 8. d. the Frenche croune, what are 135 crounes worth? As to ſay at. 4. s. 8. d. the yarde of clothe, what are 135. yardes worthe?
               9. When any 1 of the ſōmes (which is to be multiplied) is cōpounde of many denominations: &amp; thother is of one figure alone: then ſhall ye multiplie al the denominations of thother ſomme, by the ſame one figure, beginning firſt with y• ſomme, which is leaſt in value towards your right hand, &amp; bryng the product of thoſe pence into ſhi. and the product of the ſhillinges into poundes as by this example doeth appeare. 
                     〈 math 〉
                  
               
               
                  
10. But (
                     〈…〉
                   of the nombers whiche are to be multiplied) there bee with it a broken nomber, you muſte (accordyng to his denominator) take one or many partes of the nomber, as nede doeth require: and ſette the nomber whiche commeth thereof, vnder the productes, addyng the ſame together. As thus: At 5. pounde 7. ſhillynges 8. pence the groſſe, what ſhall. 34. groſſe ½ coſt? Firſt you ſhall multiplie 
                     〈 math 〉
                   5. pound. 7. s. 8. pence by. 34. groſſe, ſaiyng. 5. tymes. 34. dooe make 170. pound then for. 6. ſhilly. 8. pence, take the 
                     •
                  /3 of. 34. whiche is. 11. pounde. 6. ſhillynges, 8. pence. Thirdly, for. 1. ſhillyng, take. 34. ſhillynges, whiche is 1 pounde 14. ſhillynges. 0.
               Laſtly, for the ½ groſſe, you muſte take ½ of the. 5. pounde 7. ſhillynges 8

pence, whiche is. 2. pounde. 13. s. 10. d. And then adde thē all together, ſo you ſhall finde that the. 34. groſſe ½ at. 5 .li. 7. ſhillynges. 8 pence is worthe. 185. pounde. 14. ſhillynges. 6. pence, as appeareth in the margent.
               And as in this laſt example, you did take the halfe of the money, (whiche one groſſe was worthe) for the ½ groſſe Becauſe that one groſſe beyng worth 5. pounde. 7. ſhillynges. 8, pence, the ½ groſſe muſt be worthe halfe ſo muche So likewiſe, if you haue ⅓ of a groſſe or of any other thyng, you muſte take the. ⅓. of the price, that one groſſe is worthe. Semblable, for the. ¼. of any thyng you ſhall take the ¼ of the price, that one is worth, and of all other fractions, as by theſe examples folowing doth appeare. 
                     〈 math 〉
                  
               
               
                  
11. If you will make the proofe of theſe rules aforſaid, you muſt firſt abate the ſomme of money (which the fractiō of the multiplicand doeth importe) from the total ſomme. And diuide the reſt of the poundes of the ſaid totall ſōme, by the whole multiplicande, the fraction onely accepted. And if any thing dooe remain after the diuiſion is made, that remain ſhalbe multiplied by 20 &amp; vnto

the producte of that multiplication, you ſhal adde the ſhi. which remained of the reſt of the totall ſōme. Again, if anything do remain after the ſame diuiſion, you muſt multiply the ſame by 12 &amp; vnto ye product adde the pence of ye total ſōme that remained if any be left And thus if ye haue truely wrought, you ſhall finde again the higher ſōme of your queſtiō, that is to ſaie, the price that one groſſe, or any other thyng is worthe, whereof you demaunde.
               Or otherwiſe, reduce the remaine of the totall ſomme (the value of the money that the fraction is worthe, beyng firſte deducted) all into pence, in multipliyng the poundes by. 20. and the ſhillynges by. 12. addyng thereunto the ſhillynges and pence, which are i
                     •
                  igned with the remaine of the ſaied totall ſomme, if any ſuche be, then diuide thoſe pence by the foreſaied nomber that is to be multiplied, the fraction of the ſame nomber being alſo abated. So ſhall you finde the price that

one pece, I groſſe, or any other thyng is valued at. As in the firſte example goyng before, where the totall ſōme is. 201. pounde. 10. ſhillynges, from the whiche I dooe firſt abate the price of the halfe groſſe, whiche is. 2. pound 3. ſhillynges. 4. pence, the reſte is 199 .li. 6. ſhillynges 8. pence, whiche being reduced into pence, bringeth 47840. d. I diuide theſame by 46. and thereof commeth 1040. d. Then I diuide that 1040. d. by 12, and thei bryng 86. s. 8. d. that is to ſaie 4 .li. 6. s. 8. pēce, which is the price that one groſſe, or any other thyng did coſte, as in that firſte example doeth eppeare.
               12. The like is to bee doen of any maner of thyng, that is ſolde by the hundred, or by Kintall. As thus: at 12. pounde ſeuen ſhillynges ſix pence the hundreth pounde waight: what ſhall. 374. pounde waight coſte. You ſhall firſt multiplie twelue pound ſeuen ſhillinges, ſixe pence by thre: that is to ſaie, by three hundreth. Then for

50 .li. waight, you 
                     〈 math 〉
                   ſhall take the ½ of 12 .li. 7. s. 6. d. bicauſe 50 .li. is the ½ of 100 .li. Likewiſe for 20. pound waight, which is the ⅕ of 100 .l. take the ⅕ of 12 .li. 7. ſhil. 6. d. laſtly for 4 .li. waight take the ⅕ of the laſte product. This done, you muſte adde all theſe productes into one ſumme, whiche will make the ſumme of 64 .li. 5. s. 7. d. ⅘, as by this exāply aboue written doth appeare.
               The proofe is made by reducinge the totall ſumme into pence. And to diuide the product by the nomber y• is to be multiplyed, that is to ſaie by 374 likewiſe diuide the quotient produced of that firſt diuiſion by 12. ſo ſhall you finde againe the higher ſumme 12 .li. 7 ſhil. 6. d. whiche is the price of 100 .li. wayght, as before.
               13. Alſo the like maye be done of

our vſuall waight here in Englande (whiche is 112 .li. for euerye hundred pounde waight). in caſe you knowe the certaine parts of a hundred, that is to ſay, of 112 .li. waight, whiche are theſe 56 .li. 28 .li. 14 .li. 7 .li. For 56 .li. is the ½ of 112. 28 .li. is the ¼ of 112 .li. 14 .li. is the ⅛, and 7 .li. is the 1/16.
               Therfore, for 56 .li. take the ½ of the ſumme of money, that the 112. pound waight is worth.
               For 28 .li. take the ¼ of the ſumme of money that the 112 .li. is worth.
               For 14 li. take the ⅛ of the ſumme that the C. is worth.
               For 7 .li. take the 1/16 of the ſumme of money that the C, is worth.
               As thus: at 3 .li. 6. s. 8. d. the hundreth pounds waight, that is to ſaye, the 112, li. What ſhall 24. C. 3. quar. 21, li. coſt after the ra

which is 8, li. for

Likewiſe multiplye 100. by 6000, and diuide the producte by 11400, and you ſhal finde 52. 12/19 and ſo muche muſt the ſecond man haue for his parte of the gayne.
                  
                     
2. Two marchaunts haue companied togither, the firſt hath put in the firſt of Ianuary 640 .li. The ſeconde can lay in nothing vntil the firſt of Aprill. I demaunde how much he ſhall then laye in, to the ende that he maye take halfe the gaines? Aunſwere, Multiply 640 li. by 12. monethes that his money abideth in the companye, and therof cōmeth 7680 li. for his layinge in. And ſo muche oughte the ſeconde mannes layinge in to be, for becauſe he taketh ½ of the gaine: But for that, that be putteth in nothinge vntill the firſt of Aprill, his money can be in cō
                     pany no lōger than 9 monethes. And therefore diuide 8680 by 9, and therof commeth 753 li. ⅓ So much oughte the ſeconde marchaunt to laye in the firſt of Aprill, to the ende that he maye take the one moy

                     y of the gaynes.
                  3. Three Marchayntes haue companied togither. the firſte layed in the firſte of Marche 100 li. The ſeconde

laide in ye firſt of Iune ſo muche money, that of the gaine, he muſte haue the ⅓ parte: and the thirde laide in ye firſt of Nouember ſo muche money, that of the gaines he muſte haue likewiſe ⅓ and thei continued in company, vntil ye next Marche folowing. I demaunde howe muche the ſeconde and the thirde Marchauntes did laye in? Anſwere, Multiply 100. which the firſte man did lay in, by 12. monethes that his money continued in companie, and therof commeth 1200. for his laying in: and ſo muche ought the ſeconde and the thirde marchaunt eche of them to lay in: Bicauſe they parte the gaynes by thirdes. But for that, that the ſeconde Marchaunt putteth in nothinge tyll the firſt of Iune, hys money can bee in companye but nine monethes. Therefore diuide 1200. by nine monethes, and therof commeth 133. ⅓. And ſo muche ought the ſeconde Marchaunt to laye in: Then, foraſmuch as the thirde Marchaunt, dyd

laye in nothing vntil the firſt of Nouember: His money abideth in companye but the ſpace of foure monethes. Therefore diuide 1200. by 4. and thereof commeth three hundred pounde. And ſo much ought the thirde marchaunt to lay into companye.
                  4. Three Marchauntes haue companied togither, the fyrſte layde in the fyrſt of Ianuary a hundred Duckettes. The ſeconde hath layed in fyftye pounde, the fyrſte of Marche: And the thirde putte in a Iewell the fyrſte of Iulye: And at the yeares ende, they had gained foure hundred crownes: of the whiche, the fyrſte marchaunt muſt haue fifty crownes, and the ſeconde muſte haue 80. I demaunde what the Duc
                        •
                     et was worth and at what price the Iewell was valued, whiche the thirde Marchaunte layde in?
                  
                     
                     Aunſwere: the firſte mannes money is 1200 as afore is ſayde, and he taketh 50 crownes of the gayne: therefore ſay, if fifty crownes of gayne be come of 1200, whice was his ſtock, of how much ſhall come 80. crownes of gaine that the ſeconde man taketh? multiplye and diuide, and you ſhall finde 1920. for the ſecond marchaunts laying in. Then ſay again, if 50 crownes be come of 1200. ſtocke: of howe much ſhal come 270. crownes, which the thirde man taketh of the gayne? Multiply and diuide, &amp; you ſhall finde 6480. for the third marchauntes laying in. Then diuide 1920, whiche is the ſeconde mannes laying in, by 10. monethes that his money did continue in company, and you ſhall fynde 192 Duckets, which are worth 50 .li. bicauſe he layed in 50 li. Then diuide 192 Duckets by the ſayde 50, li. (being reduced into ſhillinges) and thereof commeth 5. ſhillings 2. pence, ½. So muche was the Ducket worth: Finallye,

diuide 6480. (whiche is the third mannes layinge in) by 6. monethes that his Iewel remained in companye, and you ſhall finde 1080 Duckets: and for that price was ye Iewell put in company.
                  5. Three Marchauntes haue companied togither: the firſt layed in the firſt of Ianuary 100 li. and the firſte of April he hath taken backe againe 20 .li. The ſecond hath layed in the firſte of Marche 60 .li. and afterward he dyd put in more 100 li. the firſt of Auguſt. The third layd in the firſt of Iuly 150 .li. And the firſt of October he did take backe againe 50 li. And at the yeres end, they found that they had gained 160 li. I demaunde how muche euery man ſhall haue? Aunſwere, Multiply 100 li. which the firſt man layed, by 12 monethes, and therof commeth 1200. li from that nomber abate 9 times 20 which are 180. and there wil remaine 1020, for the firſt mans laying in. Thē
                     
multiplie 60. which the ſeconde man layde in, by ten &amp; you ſhall haue 600 vnto the which adde 5. times one hundred, which are 500. ſo all amounteth to 1100. for the ſecond mans laying in Afterwardes, multiplie 150. pounde, which the thyrde man hath layed in, by 6. monethes, and therof commeth 900. from the which nōber abate three times 50. and they are 150: ſo there reſteth 750. for the thyrde mans laying in. Then procede wyth the reſte, as in the firſte Queſtion of the rule of felowſhip with tyme, in adding 1020, 1100. and 750. altogither, whiche ſhall be your Diuiſor: Then multiplie 160 by 1020. by 1100. and by 750. &amp; diuide at euery time by your Diuiſor, which is by all theyr layinges in added togither, and they make 2870, ſo you ſhal fynde 56. 241/287: for the fyrſte man, 61. 93/
                        •

                  6. Two Marchaunts haue companied

togither, the fyrſte hath put in 960. pounde, for the ſpace of 12. monthes, and he ought to haue 8. pounde vpon the hundred pound of the gaine. The ſecond hath layed in 1120 .li. for the ſpace of eight monthes, &amp; he ought to haue after 12. pounde vpon the 100. pound of the gaine.
                  And at the yeares ende, they haue gained eyght hundred pounde. I demaunde how much eche of them ſhall haue of the gaine. Anſwere, multiplie 960. that the firſt mā did lay in, by 12. monethes, and the product thereof, multiplie againe by 8. and you ſhall haue 62160. for the fyrſt mans laying in: then multiplye the 1120. that the ſeconde hath layed in by eyght monethes, and that whiche commeth thereof you ſhall multiplie againe by 12. and you ſhal finde 10
                        •
                     520. for the ſeconde mans layinge in, then proceede with the reſt, as in the firſt Queſtion of the Rule of Felowſhippe, and as in the laſte Exaumple, and you ſhall

finde 3993/13 for the firſt man: and 430 .li. 10/13 for the ſecond man.
               
               
                  ¶ The rule of company, betwene Marchauntes and their Factours.
                  7. The eſtimation of the bodye or perſone of a Factour, is in ſuche proportion to the ſtocke, whiche the Marchaunt layeth in: as the gaine of the ſayd Factour is vnto the gayne of the ſayd Marchaunt. As thus: if a Marchaunt do put into the handes of hys Factour 200 li. to employe, and he to haue halfe the profiſe, the perſone of the ſayd Factour ſhal be eſteemed 200 li. And if the Factour do take but the 
                        •
                     /3 of the gaine, he ſhoulde haue but ½ ſo much of the gaine as the marchaunt taketh, which ſhould take ⅔ wherfore the perſone of the Factour is eſtemed but the ½ of that which the Marchaunt layeth in, that is to ſay 100 li.
                  And if the Factour did take the ⅖ of

the gaine, then the Marchaunt ſhall take the reſidue, which are ⅗ of ye gaine wherefore the gayne of the Mayſter vnto that of the Factoure is in ſuche proportion as 3 vnto 2. Then if you will knowe the eſtimation of the perſone of the Factour, ſay if 3 giue me 2 what wil 200 giue? Multiply 200 by 2 and diuide be 3 ſo you ſhall finde 133 
                        •
                     /3 Otherwiſe, conſider that the Factour taketh the ⅗ of that whiche the Marchaunte taketh. And therfore take the ⅔ of 200, and you ſhall fynde 133. ⅓ as before: and ſo muche is the perſone of the Factoure eſteemed to bee worthe.
                  8. And if the Marchaunt ſhould deliuer vnto his Factoure 200 .li. and the Factour would laye in 40 .li. and his perſon, to the ende he might haue the halfe of the gaine: I demaund for how much ſhall his perſon be eſteemed Anſ. abate 40 li. from 200 li. and ther will remaine 160 .li. And at ſo much

ſhall his perſon be eſtemed.
                  And if the factour woulde take the ⅔ of the gaine, his perſon with his 40 pounde, ſhall bee eſteemed twiſe as muche as the ſtock that the marchant layeth in, which ſhoulde haue but ⅔ of the gaine: for ⅔ vnto ⅓, is in double proportion. Therefore double twoo hundred pounde, therof cōmeth 400 .li. from the which abate 40 .li. &amp; there will remaine 360 .li. And if the Factour would take but the ⅓ of the gaine, that ſhall bee but the ½ of ⅔ whiche the marchaunt taketh: then the eſtima
                     
                        •
                     ion of his perſon, with his layinge in ſhould be eſteemed but the halfe of the whiche the marchaunt layeth in: take therfore the 
                        •
                     /2 of 200 .li. whiche is 100 .li. from the which abate fourty pound and the reſt whiche is 60 .li. is the eſtimation of his perſon.
                  9. If it ſo chaunce that for to make traffick of 240 .li. ye perſon of the factour ſhould be ſo eſtemed, yt he ſhoulde

haue but the ¼ of the gaine, and yet he would haue the ⅔, I demaunde howe much he ſhoulde put in of readye money, beſides his perſon? Aunſwere, ſeing that his perſon gaineth the ¼, all the whole layinge in, ſhall gaine the reſt that is to ſaye the ¾: nowe for bycauſe ¼ is the ⅓ of ¾ therfore his perſon ſhalbe eſtemed the ⅓ of all the layinge in. Take then the ⅓ of 240. and you ſhall haue 80. for the eſtimation of his perſon, and for that, that he wyll haue the halfe of ye gaine, you ſhal adde 80. with 240 .li. and therof commeth 320. of the which take the halfe, which is 160. and from the ſame you ſhal abate the 80. and there wyll remaine other 80. which he ought to lay in of readye money, and the marchaunt muſte lay in the ouerplus, whiche amounteth to 160 .li.
                  10. A marchaunt hath deliuered to his Factour 1200 .li. to gouerne them in the trade of Marchandiſe vpon ſuch condition that hee for hys ſeruyce

ſhall haue the ⅓ of ye gaine if any thing be gayned, or of the loſſe if any thing be loſt: I demaund for how much hys perſon was eſtemed? Anſwere, ſeeing that the Factoure taketh the ⅓ of the gaine, hys perſone ought to bee eſteemed as muche as ½ of the ſtock whiche the Marchaunte layeth in, that is to ſay ye ½ of 1200 li. which is 900 l. The reaſon is, bycauſe the ⅓ of the gayne that the Factoure taketh, is the 
                        •
                     /2 of the ⅔ of the gaine that the Marchaunt taketh.
                  11. A Marchaunt that deliuereth vnto his Factour 1200 li. and ye Factour layeth in 500 li. and his perſon: Now, bicauſe he laieth in 500 li. and his perſone, it is agreed betwene them that be ſhal take the ⅖ of y• gain: I demaūde for how much his perſone was eſteemed? Aunſwere, Foraſmuche as the Factour taketh the ⅖ of the gaine, he ſaketh the ⅔ of that which y• March
                        •
                     ūt taketh, for ⅖ are the ⅔ of ⅗: and therefore

the Factours laiyng in ought to be 800. pound, which is the ⅔ of 1200. pounde, that the marchaunt laied in: Then abate 500. pounde, whiche the Factour did lay in, from 800. pounde, whiche ſhould be his whole ſtock and there remaineth thrée hundred pound for the eſtimation of his perſone.
                  12. More, a marchaunt hath deliuered vnto hys factoure a thouſande pounde vpon ſuche condition, that the factour for his paines and ſeruice, ſhal haue the gaines of 2. hundred pound, as though he had laide ſo muche in of redy money: I demand what the portion of the gaine, the ſaide Factour ſhall take? Aunſwere: Sée what parte the two hundreth pounde (whiche the Factour layed in) is of one thouſande twoo hundreth whiche is the whole ſtocke of their companie, and you ſhal finde that it is the ⅙, and ſuch parte of the gaine ſhall the Factour take.
                  But in caſe that in making the couenauntes, it were agreed that the

Factour ſhould haue the gaine of two boundred pounde of the ſtocke, whiche the marchaunte layeth in, that is to ſaie of the thouſande pounde. Then ſhoulde the Factour take the ⅕ part of the gaine. For twoo hundred pounde is the ⅕ of a thouſande pounde.
               
            
            
               ¶ The 11 Chapiter treatteth of the Rules of barter.
               TWoo Marchaunts will chaūge their marchandiſe, the one with the other. The one of them hath clothe of 7. s. 1. d. the yarde to ſelle for readie money, but in barter he wil ſel it for 8. s. 4. d. The other hath Sinamon of 4. s. 7. d. the li. to ſell for readie money. I demaunde how he ſhall ſell it in barter to the ende he be no loſer? Aunſwere, ſaie, if 7. 1/12 (whiche is the price that the yarde of clothe is worth in readie money (be ſolde in barter for 8. ⅓ for what ſhal 4. 7/12 be ſolde in barter which 4. 7/12 is the price that the l. of Synamon is worth in readie money, reduce the whole numbers in to their

broken, and then multiply and diuide, and you ſhall finde 5. s. 4. d. 
                     •
                  2/1
                     •
                   parts, of a penie, and for ſo much ſhall he ſell the pounde of Synamon in barter.
               2. Two Marchaunts will chaunge their marchaundiſe the one with the other, the one of them hath Chamlets of two pounde 18. s. 4. pence the péece to ſell for ready money, and in barter he will ſell the péece for 4 .li. 3, s. 4. d. the other hath fine cappes of 35. s. 10. d. the doſſen to ſell in barter. I demaund what the doſen of caps did coſt in redy money? Anſwere: ſaie if 4 .li. 3. s. 4. d. whiche is the ouerprice of the péece of Chamlet, become of 2 .li. 18. s. 4. pence whiche was the iuſt price of the ſame, of what ſhal come 35. s. 10. d. whiche is the ouerprice of the doſſen of cappes? Multiplie and deuide, and you ſhall finde 25. ſhil. 1. d. and ſo muche are the doſſen of caps worthe in redie money.
               3. Two Mharchants will chaunge their marchaundiſe the one with the other: the one of them hath Fuſtians

of 18. s. 4. d. the peece to ſell for readye money, and in barter hee will ſell the pece for 26. s. 8. pence. The other hath tapiſtrie of 15. d. the ell to ſel for readie money, and in barter he will ſell it for 20. pence the ell: I demaunde whiche of them gaineth, and how muche vppon the hundred pounde of money?
               
                  Aunſwere: ſaye if 18. s. ⅓ (which is the iuſte price of the peece of F
                     •
                  itian) bee ſolde in barter for 16. s. ⅔: for howe muche ſhall 1. s. ¼ (whiche is the iuſte price of the ell of Tapiſtry) be ſolde in barter? Multiplie and diuide, and you ſhall finde 21. d. 9/11. And he doeth ouerſel it but for 20. d. ſo that of 21. d. 9/11: bée maketh but 20. d. And therefore ſaye by the rule of three, yf the ſeconde marchaunte, of 21 9/11, do make but 20/1 how muche ſhall he loſe vpon the 100/1? Multiplie and deuide, and you ſhall find 21. ⅔, the which being abated from a hundred there wil remaine 8. ⅓. And after the rate of 8. ⅓. doeth the ſeconde marchant loſe vpon the 100. And conſèquently

the firſte marchant, of 20. d. maketh 21. d. 9/11: and therfore ſay again by the rule of thre, if the firſt marchāt of 10/11, doe make 21. 9/11 how much ſhall he gaine vpon 100/1? Multiplie and diuide, and you ſhall finde 102 .li. 1/11. Thus the firſte gaineth after the rate of nine pounde. 1/11 vpon the hundred pounde of money.
               For your better vnderſtandyng of theſe queſtions, you muſte note that when one Marchante gaineth of an other after the rate of ten pound vpon the hundred pounde hee gaineth the 
                     〈◊〉
                   of his owne principall, and the other whiche loſeth after the rate of 9. 1/11 vppon the hundred he loſeth the 1/11 of his principal. And it may be proued thus: When one marchaunt will ſell hys wares vnto an other, whiche wares ſtand him but in 100 .li. and he wil ſel thē for 110 .li. he of his 100 .li. maketh 110 .li. wherfore he gaineth after 10. li vpon the 100. whiche is the 1/1
                     •
                   of his principall, and the other whiche byeth

wares for 110 .li. that coſte but 110 .li. of the 110. poūd he maketh but 100 .li. And therfore ſay by the rule of three, if 110. become of 100. of howe muche ſhall come 100? Multiplie and deuide, and you ſhall finde 90. 10/11, the whiche abate from 100: and there reſteth 9. 1/11 whiche is the 1/11 of his principall that y• ſecond leſeth vpon the 100. as afo
                     ••
                   is ſaied. And therefore, who ſo that will know what one marchant gaineth of another, either after the rate of tenne vpon the hundred, whiche is the 1/11 of hys principall, or elſe after the rate of twentie vpon the hundred which is the ⅕, or of anye other parte, and that he would likewiſe knowe what parts the other loſeth of his principall: hee muſte take for the numeratour of the broken number of hym that loſeth, as much as for him that gaineth, then adde the numerator and the denominator (of the broken number of hym that gaineth) both togither, and make therof the denominator of the broken

number of hym that loſeth, and then ſhall you haue the parte of hym that loſeth, as by example, of him that gaineth after ten pound vpon the 100 .li. which is the 1/10 of his principall: take the numerator whiche is 1. and make that the numeratoure of the broken number of hym that loſeth, then adde 1. whiche is the numerator of the fraction of hym that gaineth with tenne, whiche is his denominator, and you ſhall haue 11. for the denominatour of the fraction of hym that loſeth. Then put one ouer the 11. and you ſhal haue 1/11. Thus it appeareth when one marchaunt gaineth of an other after ten vpon the hundred, he gaineth the 1/10 of his principall, and the other loſeth 9. 1/11 whiche is the 1/11 of hys principall. And if he woulde gaine after twentie vppon the hundred whiche is the ⅕ of hys principall, the other ſhoulde loſe ſixtine ⅖ whiche is the ⅙ of hys principall, and ſo is to bee vnderſtande of al other fractions.
               
                  
4. Two marchaunts wil chaunge their marchaundiſe the one with the other, the one of them hath Seies of 20. s. &amp; 10. d. the peece to ſel for readie moneye, and in barter he will ſell the peece for 23. s. 4 d. and yet he wil gain moreouer after ten pounde vppon the hundred pounde. The other hath wol of 50. s. the hundred to ſell for readye money. I demaunde how he ſhall ſell the C. of woll in barter; Anſwere: ſay if 20. s. 10. d. whiche is the iuſte price of the peece of Seye, be ſolde in barter for 23. s. 4. d. for how much ſhall 50. s. (which is the iuſt price of y• C. of woll) be ſolde in barter? Multipliye &amp; diuide, and you ſhal finde 56. s. Then for becauſe the firſt marchant gaineth after 10. li vpō the C .li. he maketh of his c .li. 110 .li. and conſequently the ſecond marchant maketh of 110 .li. but 100 .l. And therefore ſaie, if the ſeconde marchaunt of 110. doe make but 100 how much ſhal he mak of 56: Multiply and diuide &amp; you ſhal finde 50. s. 20. d. 10/12 of

a penie, and for ſo muche ſhall he ſelle the hundred of woll in barter.
               5. More, two Marchauntes wyll chaunge their marchaundiſe, the one with the other, the one of theim hath Taffeta, of 16 crownes the peece to ſell for readie money, and in barter he will ſel the peece for twenty crownes, and yet he wyll gaine moreouer after ten pounde, vpon the hundred pound. The other hath ginger of 3. s 9. d. the pounde waight, to ſell in barter. I demaunde what the pounde did coſte in readie moneye? Anſwere: ſaye if twenty crownes which is the ſurprice of the peece of Laffeta, become of 16. crownes the iuſte price, of how muche ſhall come. 3. s. 9. d. whiche is the price of the ouerſelling the pounde of Ginger? Multiply and diuide and you ſhal finde 3. s. Then, for becauſe that the Marchaunt of Laffeta will gaine after the rate of ten vppon the hundred▪ ſay if 100. doe giue 100. what ſhal 3. s. giue? Multiplie and deuide and you

ſhall finde thre ſhillinges thre pence 
                     〈◊〉

               ¶ The 13 Chapter treateth of the Rule of Alligation.
               THe Rule of Alligation is ſo named, for that it teacheth to alligate or binde togither diuers percelles of ſundrie prices, and to knowe howe muche you muſte take of euerye percell, accordynge to the nombers of the Queſtion.
               
                  Example.
                  1 A Goldſmythe hath three ſortes of Golde. The fyrſte is worth thirtye Crownes the pounde weyghte: The ſecende is worthe 36 Crownes. And the thyrde is worthe 45. crownes, and of theſe three ſortes he will make a Scepter of ſixe pound weight, whiche ſhalbe worthe 40, Crownes the pounde. I demaunde howe muche he muſte take of euery ſorte?

                     Anſwere: firſt you muſt ſet downe the nōbers whereof you wyl make the Alligation (which are 30. 36. 38, and 45) orderly the one vnder the other, as if you ſhoulde make of them an addiciō: and the common nomber whereunto you will reduce them, ſhall you ſet on the left hand, which common nomber in this example is 40. Then marke what ſummes bee leſſer, then that common nomber, and whiche bee greater, and wyth a draught of your penne, euermore lynke two nombers togither, ſo that the one be leſſer then that common nomber, and the other greater then he. For 2 greater nor twoo ſmaller nombers maye not bee linked together, for they wyll eyther be leſſer, or els greater then the common nomber: but one greater nomber, and one ſmaller maye be ſo mixed, that they will make the common nomber. And two greater or twoo ſmaller nombers, can neuer make the common nomber in dewe order,

as here after ſhall appeare.
                  After that you haue thus lynked them, then make howe muche eche of the leſſer nombers is ſmaller then the common nomber, and that difference ſhall you ſet againſt the greater nombers, whiche bee linked with thoſe ſmaller, eche of them with his matche ſtyll on the righte hande. And lykewiſe you muſte ſet the exceſſe of the greater nombers againſte the leſſer which be combyned with them. Then ſhall you adde all thoſe differences into one ſumme, whiche ſhalbe the firſt nomber in the rule of three, and the ſecond nomber ſhalbe the whole maſſye pece that you will haue of all the perticulers, the thirde ſumme ſhalbe eche difference by it ſelfe, and by them ſhall you finde out the fourth nomber declarynge the luſte portion of euerye perticuler in that mixture, as nowe by the former example, I wyll make it plaine.

                     
                        〈 math 〉
                     
                  
                  Here in this former example, you ſee that I haue ſet downe the ſeuerall prices, whiche be 30, 36. 42. 45, and haue linked together 30, with 45. &amp; 36. with 42. The cōmon price 40, I haue ſet on the lefte ſyde, and the difference of it from euerye ſeuerall price, I haue ſet on the ryght hande, agaynſte that ſumme wyth the whiche it is lynked. So the difference of 30 from

40 is 10, whiche I ſet againſt 45, that he is lynked wythall, and the difference of 45, aboue 40 is 5. whiche I haue ſet againſt 30.
                  So lykewayes, the differences of 42 aboue 40, is 2, that I haue ſette againſte 36. And the difference betwen 36 and 40 (whiche is 4) I haue ſette againſte 42. Then I adde all thoſe differences togither and they make 21, whiche I make the fyrſte nomber in the Rule of three, and 6 the ſeconde nomber, which is the weyght of the Scepter of Golde, and the thyrde nomber ſhall bee euerye perticuler difference. Then I worke by the Rule of three: ſayinge yf 21. (whiche is the differences added together) doe geue me 6 pounde, whiche is the weyghte of the Scepter, what ſhall 5 gyue, whiche is the firſt difference?
                  Multiplie and diuide, and you ſhall fynde one pounde 1/7: ſo muche muſte I haue of the fyrſte price.

Then doe likewiſe with the reſte and you ſhall finde 4/7 of the ſeconde price, 1 li. 1/7 of the thirde price, and 2 .li. 6/7 of the fourth, the whiche 4 ſummes beinge added together, do make 6 li. whiche is the totall that I would haue. And now to proue if the prices do agre, you ſhall do thus: Firſte multiplie this totall ſumme 6 by the common price 40 and it will make 240 Crownes, whiche you ſhall kepe be it ſelfe. And afterward multiplie euery ſeuerall ſumme of weight by the price belongynge to the ſame weyght, and if that ſume do agree with the firſt that you kepte by it ſelfe, then is youre worke well done, as here 1 li. 3/7 is the weyght of that ſorte of golde whiche is of 30 Crownes price. Then multiplie 30. by 1 li. 3/
                        •
                     , and it maketh 42. crownes, 6/7, which you ſhall ſet downe. Then multiplie 4/7 (whiche is the weyght of the ſeconde ſorte of golde) by 36, which is the price of the ſame, &amp; therof cōmeth 20 crownes 4/2: ſo again
                  
                     
1 .li. ⅓ multiplyed by 42, doth make 48 crownes. And laſte of all 2 pounde. 
                        〈◊〉
                      multiplied by 45. maketh 128 crownes 4/7. Al theſe added together dothe make 240 crownes, agreable to the former ſumme of 40 multiplied by 6: And thus I maye affirme that this worke is well done.
                  2. A Tauerner hathe foure ſortes of wine, of foure ſeuerall prices, the firſte of 8 pence the Gallonde, the ſeconde of tenne pence the Gallonde, the third of 15 pence, and the fourht of 18 pence. And he will mingle one pū
                     chen with all theſe ſortes, ſo that the Gallonde ſhalbe worthe but twelfe pence. I demaunde howe many Gallondes he muſte take of euery ſorte? Aunſwere: Firſte ſuppoſe the punchen to holde ſome certayne meaſure, as to conteyne 84 Gallondes and then the (forme wyll bee after this ſorte, as you ſee here after folowynge.

               THe Rule of falſehod is ſo named not for that it teacheth any deceyte of falſehode, but that by fayned nombers taken at all aduentures, it teacheth to finde out the true nōber that is demaunded. And this (of all the vulgare Rules whiche are in practiſe) is the moſt excellent: this rule hath two parts, the one is of one falſe poſition alone: the other is of two poſitions as here after ſhall appeare.
               
                  
Thoſe queſtions whiche are done by falſe poſitions, haue theyr operations, in a maner like vnto that of the rule of three, but onely that in the rule of three, we haue three nombers knowen, and here in this rule wee haue but one (I meane that commeth in operation) vnto the likenes whereof we muſte diuiſe two other, the one multiplying, and the other diuidyng, as by example.

Here you ſee that there are diuers termes: but the chiefe to worke with all is 500 li. whiche commeth of the other nombers, that is to ſaye, of 10, and 100 for of them is compounde the tenour

of the queſtion, the practiſe whereof is thus.
               Let vs faine a nomber at pleaſure, and with the ſame let vs make oure diſcourſe, euen as though it were the principalll ſumme that we ſeke for. As by Example. Suppoſe that I deliuered hym at the firſte 200 pounde, the whiche were worthe to me in 10 yeares 120 pounde after the rate of 6 vpon the hundred pound. Then 120 pounde added with 200 pounde. Do make but 320 li. and I muſt haue 500 li. Thus you ſee that I haue three termes for the rule of three: the one which ſhall conteine the Queſtion the other two, which I haue 200, &amp; 320: in ſuch ſorte, that 320, ought ta haue ſuthe proporcion to 200, as 500 hat vnto the nomber that I ſeeke: that is to ſay, vnto the true principal ſumme, then muſt I haue recourſe vnto the rule of three, after this ſorte, ſaying.

If 320. pound become of 200. pounde of howe muche ſhall come 500. pound Multiply 500: by 200. and thei are 100000. the whiche you ſhall diuide by 320. pounde and thereof commeth 312. pounde. ½ whiche is the ſumme that I deliuered at the firſte, and thus, this rule hath ſome congruence with the double rule of three.
               2. I haue a Ceſterne with 3. vnegal cockes conteining 60. pipes of water: And if the greateſt cocke bée opened, the water will auoyde cleane in one houre, at the ſeconde yt will anoyde in twoo houres, and at the thirde it will require three houres. Nowe I demande in what ſpace wil it auoide, all the cocks beyng ſet open. Suppoſe that it wyll auoide in halfe an houre, that is to ſaie, in 30. minutes. Then muſte there auoide at the firſte cocke, the ½, whiche is thirtie pipes, and by the ſeconde cocke the ¼ whiche is 15, pipes, and by the thirde cocke the ⅙, that is tenne pypes, all the whiche

ſummes beeyng added together doeo make fiftie fiue pipes, but it ſhoulde be ſixtie pipes. Therefore I ſaie by the rule of thrée, if fiftie fiue pipes doe voide in thirtie minutes: in how manye minutes will ſixtie pipes voide? Multiplie and diuide, and you ſhall finde thirtie twoo minutes 40/55. And in that ſpace will the water auoide if all the cockes be ſet open.
               
                  ¶ Of the rule of two falſe poſitions.
                  THe ſumme of this rule of two falſe poſitions is thus, when any queſtion is proponed appertaining to this rule. Firſt imagine any nūber at your pleaſure, which you ſhal name the firſt poſition, and with the ſame ſhall you worke in ſtede of the true number, as the queſtion doth import, and if you ſée that you haue miſſed. Then is the laſt number of ye worke either to great or to litle, yt ſhal you note for to be the firſt errour,

in the which you haue miſſed with the ſigne of more, or leſſe, whiche ſignes ſhalbe noted with theſe figures, 4
                        •
                     :—This figure 4: betokeneth more, and this plaine line—ſignifieth leſſe, that is to ſaie the one ſignifieth to muche &amp; the other to little: then begin again, &amp; take an other number, whiche ſhal be the ſecond poſition, and worke by the queſtion as before, if you haue miſſed againe, note the exceſſe or want, for that is the ſeconde errour. Then ſhall you multiplie the firſt poſition by the ſecond errour croſſewiſe, and againe the ſeconde poſition by the firſt errour (and this muſt alwaies be obſerued) &amp; keepe the two productes: then if the ſignes be both like, that is to ſaie, either both to muche, or both to little, abate the leſſer producte frō the greater and likewiſe, you ſhall ſubſtract the leſſer error from ye greater, &amp; by the remaine of thoſe errours, you ſhal diuide the reſidue of the products: the quotient ſhal be the true number that you ſéeke for.

But if the twoo ſignes be vnlyke, that is to ſay, the one to muche and the other to lyttle, then ſhall you adde thoſe productes together ſo ſhall you alſo adde bothe the errours together, and by the ſumme of thoſe errours, diuide the totall ſumme of both the products: the quotient ſhall be likewiſe the true number that the queſtion ſeketh, and this is the wholerule, as by example. 
                        •
                     3. A manlying at the point of death, ſaied that he had in a certain Coffer a hundred duckets, the which he bequea ched to 3. of his frends by him named, after this ſorte. The firſt muſt haue a certain portion, the 2. muſt haue twiſe ſo manie as the firſt abatyng 8. Duckets &amp; the third muſte haue 3. times ſo many as the firſt, leſſe by 15 Duckets. Nowe, I demaunde howe many euerie of them muſt haue. Anſwere: Firſt I doe imagine that the firſte man had thirtie Duckets, then by the order of the queſtion, the ſeconde ſhoulde haue fiftie twoo: and the third ſeuentie fiue.

Theſe three ſummes beyng added together doe make 157: and I ſhoulde haue but a hundred ſoe that this fiirſte errour is to much by fiftie ſeuen, then I note a parte the firſt poſition thirtie, with hys errour fiftie ſeuen, to muche after this ſorte thirtie. 457.
                  Therefore I proſecute my worke and I ſuppoſe that the firſte hadde twentie foure, then by the orderder of the queſtion, the ſeconde ſhould haue 40. and the third, fiftie ſeuen, theſe three ſummes beyng added together, doe ma
                        ••
                      121. and I muſt haue but a hundred, ſo the ſeconde errour, is to muche by 21. Therefore I note 24. 421. vnder the thirtie. 457. as you maye ſee in the margent of the nexte ſide following. Then I multiplie croſſewaies, thirty (which is the firſte poſition) by twelue which is the ſeconde errour, and therof commeth 630. likewiſe I multiplie twentie and four (which is the ſecond poſition) by fiftie ſeuen, whiche is the firſte errour, and I finde 1368: then

becauſe the ſignes of the errours are 
                        〈 math 〉
                      bothe like: that is to ſaye muche, I muſt therfore ſubſtracte 630. from 1368. and ther wil remain 731 which is the diuidende: again I muſt ſubſtract the leſſer error from the greater, that is to wit, 21. out of 57. and there will remain 36. whiche ſhalbee my diuiſor. Thys done I diuide 738 by 36 and the quotient will bee 20. 
                        〈◊〉
                     . The which 20. ½ is the iuſt number of the duckets that the firſt man had for his parte, ſo conſequently the ſeconde manne had thirtie three Duckets, and the thirde fourty ſix ½, as by proofe in the margent maie appeare.
                  
                     
The like number wil alſo appeare. in caſe the errours wer both to little, as in makyng the twoo poſitions by 18. and 20. where you ſhal finde the 
                        〈 math 〉
                      two errours both to little, the firſte will bée to lyttle by 15. and the ſeconde to little by 3. as by peruſing this worke in the margent you ſhal well perceiue.
                  Againe if one of the errours were to muche, and the other to little, yet ſhall I haue the true number, as before: As if the twoo poſitions were 24. and 20. I ſhall finde that the firſte errour will be 21. to muche, and the ſeconde wil be three to little: Therfore I multiplie twentie foure by thirtie, croſſewaies, thereof commeth 72.

Likewiſe I multiplie twentie by 21. 
                        〈 math 〉
                      the product will be 420: Theſe twoo ſummes 72. and 420, I adde both together becauſe ye ſignes of the errours bee vnlyke, and thei mak. 492. the whiche ſhalbee my diuidende, and againe, I addde the leſſer errour three, with the greater errour 21. and they mak 24. for my diuiſor, then diuiding foure hundred ninetie two by twenty foure, the quotiet wilbe twentie ½: as in the margent doth plainlie appeare.
                  And now becauſe you ſhall not forget this parte of the rule, learne thys briefe remembraunce followyng.
                  The ſignes both like ſubſtraction doe require
                  And vnlike ſignes addition will deſire
                  
                     
The meanyng whereof is thus yf both the errours haue lyke ſygnes, then muſte the diuidende and the diuiſor bee made by ſubſtraction, as is taught before, and if thoſe ſygnes bee vnlike, then muſte I by addition gather the diuidende, and the diuiſor, as I haue done in this laſte example.
                  4. A man hath twoo ſiluer cups of vnegall waight, hauynge to them bothe, but one couer, the waight whereof is fiue ounces, if the couer be putte to the leſſer cuppe, it wyll bee in double proportion vnto the waight of the greater, and the couer béeyng put to the greater cuppe, will bee in triple proportion, vnto the waight of the leſſer. I demaunde what was the waight of euery cuppe.
                  Suppoſe that the leſſer cuppe dyd wayghe ſeauen ounces, then wyth the couer it muſte waigh twelue, and this waight ſhoulde be in double proportion vnto the greater, therefore

the greater muſte waigh ſix ounces

                      adde vnto it 5 ounces for ye couer, all wil be 11. ounces, but it ſhould be 21 for to haue it in triple proportion, vnto 7. which repreſēteth ye weght of the leſſer cuppe So that this firſt errour is to little by 10. which you ſhall note after ſeuen in this ſorte. 7.-10.
                  After you ſhall ſuppoſe ſome other number, as 9. and make the like work as before, ſo ſhal you finde 15. to little, for the ſecond errour, which you ſhall put behind nine, and then worke with the reſte as aboue is ſayed, and you ſhall finde that the leſſer cuppe wayed three ounces, and conſequentlye the greater foure ounces.
