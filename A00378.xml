            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

shuld be loved and norisshed indifferently / as the membres of one bodye. That evyll men yf they can not be reformed and brought in to a good ordre ought to be suffered. That they whiche are despoyled of theyr goodes / and put from their po

Paraventure another whiche is not Christen shall more subtyllye dispute / by what maner the Angelles vnderstond: How be it to persuade and exhorte / that we may here lyve pure and immaculate from all vices and iniquites. And to lede an angelles liffe / that is the office and deutye of a Christen and devine. If eny man wold obiecte / and say that these are grosse / and vnsavery thinges. To hym wold I none other wysse answere. But that Christ chefly hath taught these thinges. And that the Apostles to these have vs exhorted.



This learninge and doctrine be it never so vnsaverye hath brought vs forthe so many good christen / and so thike swarmes of faithfull martyrs. This vnlearned (as they calle it) philosophy / hath subdued vnder her lawes the most noble princes so many kingdoms / so many nations: whiche thinge no kinges power. Nother learninge of the philosophers was ever able to bringe to passe: Nother will I resist thē but that they maye dispute their profounde and sotle questions (yf it please them) amonge the more perfecte / how be it the rude multitude of the christen may be comforted / be cause truly thappostles did never teach soch thinges. Whether they knewe them or no I wold other men shuld iudge.

            THe cause why the apostle did write this presente chapter was this. The Corinthiās whiche dyd receave the doctrine of Christe ād so did become his servantes / and specyally they whiche before had folowed ye Iewes wayes / did observe both the Euangely / and also the lawe of Moses. Now hadde Moses commaunded that every man shulde be maried. So that a man by the lawe of matrimony shulde be associate and kepe company with a womā / ād the womā with a man

               dempned / as a state baren and vnfrutefull. The cause was this. God hadde promysed in the olde testamente that Christe shulde descende of the seede of Abrahā. Now did no body yet knowe what parsones were the seede that shulde begette him. It was therfore necessaryly required that the Hebrues all / which were Iewes shulde be coniugate in mariage for honore ād love of this seede / and to engendre children vntill the advente and cominge of Christe.
            For this cause didde the Corinthyans demaunde / whether they were bounde to kepe the aforesayde lawe? And whethere yt was

Wherfore this evill of vnwilfull chastite can by no medicine be holpen and healed / onles when a man ys ridde from dawnger ofsinne. Whiche can be by no nother waies then by the healpe and remedy of mariage. But other exterior grefes or trobles concerninge mānes body maye be holpen by pacience / allthough a man be never ridde from them.

That ys to saye. A man vnto whom ys gevē of god / that he cā gladly with hys very harte and wylle abyde syngle / the same man may leade a quyet lyfe. Thys doth reporte the comō proverbes / that mē vse to speake. Suche as be thes / Be thou maryed o fole (doth on saye vnto an other) and thy ioye shall shortly have an ende. Also / maryage ys a shorte ioye and a longe sorowe / and suche other lyke. Whyche all do



well agree with this place of Paule / Yt is good for a man not to touche a woman. Therfore dyd Moses also commawnde in the lawe that a man newly maryed shulde be quyte and fre from all publike charges by the space of an whole yeare / yt he myght have ioye and make mery with hys wyfe / nother shulde he be called to goo in warfare / nother to beare eny charge or office. As though Moses shuld saye / he shall lyve a yeare in gladnesse / and after he shall suffer troble sorowe and angwysshe.
               But yf yt be not gevē a man to lyve with his very harte and mynde chaste or vnmaryed. Yt is better for hym to take a wyfe to be hys cōpanyon. Ye there is no thynge elles at all lefte or remayninge / that maye ease ād healpe the / excepte honest ād chaste matrimony. Wherfore where it ys not geven a mā to enioye and vse the cōmodytes of syngle livinge and chastite. It is necessarye to geve him silf vnto the troble / pay

                  es / and vexations of mariage. For it ys alwaye better to leade a miserable or sory lyfe with out sinne in mariage / then to lyve ioyfully in the foule sinne of lecherye vnmaryed. But there is no body that wille gladly put them selves into suche paynes and sorinesse. And therfore doth well nygh every man for his parte abhorre wedlocke. Wherfore it is a comon vsed by worde. He muste be hardye



that shall mary a wyfe. And with out fayle he had nede to be very hardye Nother ys there / eny parsone that leveth more blessydly or quietly then a pure christian / whiche beyng ledde and gyded by faith can so fassion him sylfe agayne trobles and stormy seasons of aduersyte / that he doth no whit complayne / nother crye / ne blaspheme god and his worde: Lyke as do the mad and blindewise men of this worlde.
               Thus doth saynte Paule here meane in this place / when he so sodenly after the cō
                  mendacion and prayse of chastite returneth vnto mariage sayeng / but to avoyde fornication / lett every man haue hys wife / and lett every woman haue hyr husbāde.

No thinge verily elles / but where as suche maner quietnes ys not / that a man can willingly lyve chaste / that then he shulde wayte after no thinge more surely to folowe or to come / then fornicacion and lecherye. Wherfore yf the gyfte of chastite do lacke / yt ys better to be with out the pleasure and profytes of chastyte / ād to gyve hym selfe vnto the miseryes / trobles / and paynes of matrimony / for avoydīge of synne.

Here you se that maryed folkes are so mightely knitte and coniugate to gether that one ought not to absente or wythdrawe thē selves frō the other with out they both consente. No not for cause of fastinge nor of prayer. So yt he had rather prayer and fastinge to be lette passe and vndone / then one of then shulde absente their bodyes from the other.

That they shulde praye continually with out cessinge. This fastinge is mesurabyll vsage of meates ād drinkes. And prayer is a criyng sigh / desyer / and morninge.
               That in our englisshe texte we do here rede / withdrawe not yowe selves one from an other / it sowndeth rather after the Greke and laten examples / if it shulde be translate worde for worde: defraude you not or deceave you not one an other. Neverthelesse our englisshe texte doth right well and expressely shewe the sense and meaninge of this place / lyke as it doth excellently well of all other poyntes. For a man or a woman that is maryed for avoyding of fornicacyon hath no power over their awne bodyes. But the wife hath power over the body of hyr husbā
                  de / and like wise hath the man the same power over his wife. So that yf the one shulde withdrawe them selves from the other / deniyng them their bodyes to vse accordinge to naturall vsage / permitted vnto mariage / it is vndouted that they shulde so defraude them / and do them wronge.
               Also this naturall vsage of my body is



before called due benevolence that Paule 
                     •
                   litell before biddeth every man to geve vnto his wife. Yf I therfore shulde wythdrawe me or denie it. I shulde wythdrawe that is my dutye to geve. And that were no thinge elles but fraude ād deceate. So that you have here clerely shewed before youre eyes that suche wythdrawing is very fraude / and no thinge elles. This have I shewed you / that you shulde not lacke eny knowledge other of this place or yet of eny other / yt I by the grace of god can helpe you vnto. And moreover to blanke and confownde oure pharisees &amp; enimies of the trueth. Whiche yf they ones heare that I do interprete this place other wyse then it standeth writtē in the englisshe translacyon of the testamente / shulde paravē

Loe they contrary themselves on an other / how mad therfore ar ye to beleve them? Therfore lesse yt you shulde be trobled by suche deceavable reasons and argumētes I have shewed you by reasons manyfeste / &amp; authorite sufficient that we do not vary / ne contrary one an other. But that he vsing this worde wythdrawe / doth both well interprete or translate / and by so translatynge also notably



and playnly doth expounde what is naturally signified by the greke and laten examples which if they were translate in to englisshe / worde for worde shulde be as I haue tolde you before thus moche to saye: 
                     •
                  efraude you not on an other. And this fraude is whē a mā withdraweth hī frō his wife / or the wife from hir husbande.
               What the causes of this fraude or withdrawing might be / can I not shewe you so well / as they that have had experience. Neverthelesse I can lightly beleve that there be diverse causes / as is sitting for that state / which is ordeyned for the time of troble ād adversite / and not only for time of pleasure / and prosperite. In this state doth ofte times aryse anger / variance and debate. And other whil

               The cause which sainte Paule sheweth / is that two maryed persones maye consente to abide severalle a fewe dayes the one from the other to tame and chastise their flesshe by speciall or singular ceremonies as fastinge and fervente prayer / specially if so at eny time neade doth require / for stronge and

With out doute he willeth mariage to be a free thinge so that no man shulde be compelled to binde

               Thou wilte here obiecte againste me: No parsone shall then by this sentence abyde single or chaste: but every man shall contracte matrimony whyche thynge shulde be contrary vnto this texte of Paule. I wolde that all men were / as I my silfe am? To this I make answere / that I dyd now speake of the spretualle estates compared vnto matrimony / and not of syngle lyvinge or chastite.

More over syngle and chaste lyvynge be an other maner thynge then a spretualle estate. Of spretuall estates doth Paule here speake no thinge at all: But he speaketh of true chastite / for no estate (I reporte me vnto yow) ys more vnchaste ne more prone vnto wantonnes lecherye / or fornycacyon / 



then is this whiche we calle ecclesiastike or spretualle / as experience doth now a dayes over moche shewe. But if so be that some of them do lyve chaste / yet not wyth standinge they do not vse chastite accordī

So that it can not be that chastite / wherof sainte Paule doth here make mencyon / for they of chastite do make avaunsemente of merite / excellencye / and dignite or worthynesse before god and man. But saint Paule maketh it an easinesse / &amp; quietnesse / wherby one may the morceasely / lightly and quietly / serve in the worde of God / gevinge more hede or attendance vnto ye same. So that finally in learninge therof he maye growe / and be mo

Have not we (sayth Paule) power to leade aboute a sister to wife as wele as other apostles / and as the bretherne of the lorde and Cephas? Other only I and Barnabas have not power this to do? But this doth not prove that Paule did alwaye lyve single / but moche more doth it rather shewe that he had a wife / yet for all that wolde not he leade hir aboute with him as the other apostles did leade aboute their wyfes. So that by this texte only / he shewed plainly vnto our vnderstandinge / yt he now was as an other widdower with out a wife / and yet neverthelesse he had power la

from power to marye a wife / ne have yt taken a waye from hym / he is verely after the popes lawe digamus. All be it he recketh not therfore: And to be digamus by the Popes lawe is a thinge so hydeous and detestable / that all though a man so beyng were with out a wife / yet shulde he not be admitted for to be a pryste. Finally digamus betokeneth hī / that hath had two wifes. Suche in the olde testamente were those called / that had two wyfes at ones / or to gether. But the canon lawe / whiche is made by the pope / and his clyentes hath translate this worde in to an other significacyon. And hath made thre maner of digamus. The fyrste ys yf a man by processe of tyme be twise maried / all be yt other eche of the women / whom he did mary were maydens or vergyns. Secondly yf a man doth mary but ones / yf so she whome he maried were a widdowe. Thyrdely yf a man do mary one / that hath ben defloured in stedde of a mayde.
               And these be all of the pope called digami / Nother may any man after the deth of suche wifes be promoted (as they are wonte to calle y

               For asmoche therfore as they be compelled to knowledge that the apostles even after their apostlesshippe did abyde styll and continue in matrimony I wolde faine knowe why that prystes do not mary? Or elles wherfore they maye not mary? Is maryage suche a devillysshe thinge / if so yt be begonne after pristehode / and so godly if it go b

at hys fyngers endes / yt what so ever thinge may be godly with pryste hode and after it / ye very same maye be well begūne in pristehode / and before it. Moreover this maye right well be called a shamefull iuggkynge and a sore deceavable colour / that matrimony shulde be called ād preached to be a godly thinge (as in very dede it is) and graunted of them to be an holy sacramente / and yet may not be admitted that a godly thinge &amp; sacramente shulde have place with our prystes O miserable ād blynde blyndenes / that men not only can not be made beleve that suche thinges be very tryfles / and delusyons but also yt they be broughte in mynde to iudge that maner of lyvynge to be of all other moste excellente and beste / howe myghtever this thinge have come to passe / onles ye wrathe of god had thus punisshed the worlde / and plaged it with blindenesse?
               Let vs therfore abyde here by Paule / whiche in no wise shall deceave vs. He doth ordeyne that widdowers maye lefully marye wifes whether they be prystes / or no: besyde forthe that all maner widdowers or vnmaryed men may mary wifes. So that it shulde nother hurte ne hynder vnto pristehode yf one maryed a widdowe. Nor any whit helpe and further / yf he marye a mayde / and vyrgen. For there ought to be no suche respecte of parsons concerninge this purpose.



But all soche thinges amonges christē mē ought to be free / and in their electyon to take whether they luste / other mayde / or widdowe to be their laufu

And bycause he doth separate none estate / ne parsone: yt shall not be lefulle for vs to applye and appointe his worde vnto laye mē only / nor yet vnto any other certen estate or parsone.
               Sainte Paule truly did knowe fulle well both by the doctrine / &amp; also by ye ordinaūce of Christe / yt nother ye worke of god might be letted / or forbiddē / ne his creature fordone &amp; destroyed. Now is mā verely the creature / &amp; worke of god / made or create to begette childre / ād to multiplye his seade / as appereth Gene. i. For asmoche therfore as god which is alway cōstante / like minded / &amp; with out any altera

Nother to lette the worke or operacyō of mānes nature whiche of god ar naturally in thē implanted. But what other thinge is it to saye / when a priste is forbiddē to mary / then that a mā shulde not be a mā And yt the creature or worke of god shulde

               I saye vnto the vnmaryed mē / ād widdowes: It is good for thē yf they abyde even as I do: But and yf they can not abstayne / let them mary. For it is better to marye / then to burne.
               ¶It is good verely to abide as Paule did / but in continente he addeth wherfore it is not good ād yt it is better to cōtracte matrimony / then to abyde in widdowhode or vnmaryed. And Paule doth here shewe forth all at ones all the causes of matrimony / and se

                  teth abounde to mesure or enclose all the glory of castite / when he sayeth: But and yf they can not abstayne / lette



them marye. This is as moche to saye. Necessite compelleth the to mary againe. How excellently so ever therfore chastyte be praysed / and how noble so ever the gifte therof be / yet necessite causeth that very fewe do there vnto attaine / for they can not abstaine and abyde chaste / for all be it yt we are christen / havinge the sprete of god by faith: yet is not the worke and creature of god in vs stroyed and taken awaye from vs / that thou muste cesse to be a woman / and I a mā. Nother doth the sorete bereve from the body his inclinacyon and naturalle workes / but that it may eate / drinke / slepe / disgeste / and disgeftyon avoyde / like as the body of an other man.
               In lyke wise doth not the sprete take awaye from man ne frome woman their shappes / their lymmes / or membres / their seade / ne their frute and operacyon / for a christen mā
                  nes body muste aswelle norisshe seade / begette childre / and multiplye / as the body of other men of byrdes and of all bestes / and lyvely thinges. Vnto the whiche purpose it also was create. As ys shewed Genesis .i. So that man of necessite muste appete naturally a woman / and the woman a mā / onles god wonderfully by a singular &amp; excellent gyfte do holde them therfro and delyver them. And thus meaneth Paule here in this place / when he sayeth: But yf he cā not



abstaine / let him mary. As though he shulde saye. Vnto whom god hath not geven a singular grace / but leaveth in his body the nature and disposicion of the same: It is good for him / ye it is necessary that he do mary / forsakinge both verginite and also wyddowhede / furthermore it is not the mynde of god to make a principalle and singular gifte comon vnto many / but wolde that maryage shulde be comon to eche body: like as he dyd ones ordene and create yt / he wille not take awaye his creature from every man / ne lette the operacyon of the same.
               Moreover a Christen man is sprete and flesshe. By reason of the sprete he neadeth not of matrimony. But bycause his flesshe hath communion &amp; felishippe with the corrupte flesshe in Adam and Eve / &amp; so is fulle of luste and concupiscence / for this disease and malady hath he truly neade of matrimony: and by his awne strenght / or power can he not be with out them / for his flesshe rageth / burneth / ād breadeth seade / as wele as doth the flesshe of eny other parsone. Where as by matrimony / as by a medicine there vnto moche necessary and behovable he doth not ease / helpe / quenche / and represse yt / for in the .iij. chapter of Genesi. he sheweth clerely before oure face / what thinge he wolde suffer in man / when he did not only not take away the blessinge of multiplicacion



/but rather dyd alowe and conferme yt. When notwithstādinge he dyd knowe full well / that suche blessynge coulde not be fulfylled and performed of nature (that was corrupte and fulle of concupiscence) whith out synne.
               But that matrimony is comenly had in disdayne as a thinge that is cause of many myseries / paynes / troble / and hevynes / and so yōge people are thereby persuaded to decline there fro vnto vnwylfull chastite: yt ys a reason vnprofitable ād of no value / but pevisshe ād moche synfulle. Nother have they so made good the cause of their chastite. For necessite doth alwaye prevēte and stoppe out this forechaste or provisiō. Whiche sayeth that yt nother is / ne yet cā so be. For no mā cā grounde or set him selfe faste in heven: Accordinge as here doth affirme saynte Paule: he that can not abstayne (sayeth he) / lett him mary. Agayne warde that matrimony is hyghly commended as a thinge that is hevynly and godly &amp; moste fulle of all goodnes. This is lyke wysse a reasone of smalle effecte / ād prevayleth not. Forthere is no mā o

It is therfore called necessite / for nature muste nedes have an yssue / and go forthe / that it maye encrease and be multiplyed. But thys wille not god admitte with out matrimony Therfore hath every man neade to go there vnto / necessite so requiringe ād constreynige him to do / yf so he wille here before God passe his lyve with a good conscience. And were it not that this necessyte did thus bynde / wreste / and dryve me / I wote not truly what matrimony the other causes shulde make &amp; stablisshe.

               But what meaneth he by this yt he sayeth it is better to mary thē to burne? Every mā no faile that with out mariage &amp; a specialle grace at tēpteth to lyve single or chaste knoweth right well what this sayeng is &amp; what it doth meane. Nother doth he here touche

And the womā which hath vnto hyr husbande and infidele / yf he consente to dwelle with hir let hir not put hem a waye.
               
                  ¶Whē sainte paule recordeth that this parte is not his saiyng / but y• saiyng of y• lorde / he sheweth yt it is not cōmaūded of god to do other this or elles that / for he divideth his sayenge from the worde or sayeng of God. So that the sayinge of god is a precepte and cōmavndemente / but his / is a counsell. More over his entente is to saye thus. To the remnaunte / that is to wit / where raigneth no debate and brawlinge betwyxte maryed mates. As whē two ar coupled in matrimony. Of whiche the one is a christian / &amp; the other havinge no knowlege of christe (like as it was comonly sene when fayth was at the firste tyme preached amonges the gentilles that one shulde turne him vnto Christe / and an other turne frō him) All be it that in this case a Christen parsone may departe from one that is not Christen. Yet neverthelesse the councelle of the apostle is that soche shulde not departe. Inasmoche as his maryed mate whyche ys not Christen doth accepte hym and ys contente wyth hym And doth not let him to coūterfette and expresse Christe in maner of lyvinge / nother cō
                  strayneth hym to lyve wyckedly or to abiure Christe.
               This doth Paule signifye in this worde yf she consente or be contente to dwelle with him &amp;c. That is to saye if an infidele or vnbelever be contente / ād will dwelle with him

                  h maryed her / and wille suffer hyr to do all that pertayneth vnto a christen body / for matrimony is but a corporalle and an outwarde thinge whiche doth nother hurte ne helpe / nother doth hinder ne further faith: And in whiche the one may be a christian / and the other an infidele. As well as one that is sworne vnto Christe maye eate / drī

                  erfecte and devoute Christian and the other a wicked and famed or false Christyan. So that matrimony for cause of byleve or vn byleve ought not to be broken &amp; fordone.
               But yf an infidele wolde not suffer hys maryed mate to abyde Christian / or to lyve a Christian lyfe / but wolde persecute and lett her. There were it conveniente tyme y• a christen body shulde vse the sentence of Christe / whiche saith in the .x chapter of Mathew: He that loveth his wife or childre more thē me / is not worthy of me.

So y• yet vnto the parsone which disyreth to have peace &amp; atonemente shall not be denied authorite afterwarde to mary an other / as ys specifyed before / for Christe whiche ys the

to forsake them and departe awaye frō them. Of this is gathered. That those be wicked examples. In whiche we do fynde that certen maryed womē by consente of their husbandes (whiche had bene imp

The reasō why is / where his maryed fellow doth not compelle him to forsake and renounce christian lyvinge / fayth is so mighty a thinge that no hurte can be to it / ne to the possessioners therof by lyvinge or company keping with infideles and vnbelevers. And it is all one vnto them whether the thinge be holy or vnholy / pure or elles vnpure / yt they do vse / for even very deth whiche is of all thinges moste hydeous and terrible is vnto them thorow faith an holy &amp; a precyons thī
                  ge faith doth vse all thinges well and accordingly / whether they be good or elles evill / excepte only vnbileve ād the frutes ther of / for they as strayte as a lyne be contrary vnto faith / and thruste it out of place. Elles what so ever doth not expelle faith ād put it out of place / is by reason of the same fayth harmelesse / pure / clene / holy / profitable ād holsome: So that faith may company with them / vse them / and finally continue with them with out any hurte or ieoperde / that maye vnto it thorow them befalle for onles it were thus: No parsone might ever lyve christiā / for he muste nedes abide &amp; passe the covrse of his lyfe in ye middes of vnbelevīge evill &amp; wicked people, But whē he foloweth



not their manners / but doth ryghtly vse thē / he may well lyve by them / and amōges thē / that by his good behavore and diligēce they finally maye be striken with remorse &amp; compuncciō of minde &amp; become godly &amp; christiā
               
               In this ys all the worlde vnto a true christian nothinge but holynesse / purenesse / profite / and goodnesse. Contrary wyse / All the whole worlde ys vnto an vnbelever or an in fydele vnholynesse / vnclennesse / hurte &amp; destructiō / yee evē god hī silfe with all his vniuersalle goodnesse. As Davyd writeth in ye xvij. psalme sayng: Thou shalte with holy be holy / and thou with the good and innocente shalte be innocēte and good. And with the chosen shalte thou be chosen / and with the perverse and weywarde shalte thou be weywarde. And whyr for holy folkes and saintes / that is to saye belevinge persones do holyly and blessydly vse all thinges. But the vnholy and vnbelevinge or infideles do dismerite or deserve the contrary / that ys to saye they misuse / make vnclene / and defyle them selves in all thinges vniuersally / ād that alwaye. For they can vse no thinge well or holyly / that yt shall profite them vnto blysse. Thus be also infātes holy &amp; clene / allthough they have not yet receaved baptisme Not bicause they be in their awne persone clene ād holy. Of whiche holinesse or clēnesse ys here of Paule made no mencion: But bycause



they be clene ād holy to the. For thy holyne

                     •
                   are their parentes were / holy or clene. For in this wise entendeth here Paule to saye / yf a chrysten body shulde happly have childre with an infidele / whiche chyldre were growen vnto yeres of discrecion (as in that tyme was often sene) ād they wolde not assente to be yet baptised ne become the servantes of Chryste. Then for so moche as no persone ought to be cōstrayned vnto fayth / but there vnto to be drawen of god thorow preachinge of the evāgely. Nother of ye fryndes shulde therfore purpose in their minde to forsake their childre / ne denye ād take from thē fattherly or motherly love and kyndenesse / whiche they also do owe vnto them / as though they dyd synne and defyle thē sylves by abydinge with their vnbelevinge childre. But bodyly they owe to be presente with them / overseyng / rulyng / and nurtringe them as well as they were moste holy christianes / fo
                     •
                   they are not vnclene (sayth Paule) but holy &amp; pure. That is to saye / Thy fayth maye so be well occupied &amp; exercised aboute thē / that yt shall yet abyde both holy &amp; pur

                  gely / they ought not therfor to be refused &amp; caste awaie / but thou shulde take diligēte kepe &amp;



make provision for them / as well as yf they were moste faythfulle or Christian. Their faith commended vnto god / so longe as in other pointes they were buxum / and behaved thē honestly in worldly and outwar / de thinges. For the outwarde dedes like as the parētes may evē so are they also bounde to let and inh

                  bite with punisshinētes: But vnbeleve &amp; inwarde evilles. Nother can ony parsone let / ne by chastysemente refraine excepte god onley. So that this texte of sainte Paule remayneth stylle a mighty and valyant defense for vs / teachinge that all thinges be holy and pure to thē that beleve / and have faith.
            
            
               But ād yf the vnbelevinge departe / let him departe. A brother or a sister is not in subiection to soche. God hath called vs in peace.
               ¶In this place Paule delyvereth ād setteth quyte a christian maryed parsone gevinge sentence for him / that when his maried mate being an infidele or an vnbelevīge body will departe or elles will not graunte ye he shall folowe Christe. Then doth he geve him libertye to mary againe with an other. And that Paule doth here speake of maryed mate / being an infidele or payneme / the same ought to be vnderstande also of fayned or false christian. That yf one maryed mate wolde

               But this doth Paule here denie sayenge. That vnto soche is not a brother or a sister in subiectiō / ne thraulde. as though he shulde saye: Vnto other parsones o

But where as the one wille straine the other vnto wicked and vngodly lyvinge / or elles they wille departe a sondre / In soche poyntes is not a christen body bounde ne compelled to abyde with soche mates eny longer. If then he standeth not bounde / then is he ridde &amp; dispatched. And if he be ridde and dispatched he maye thē lefully mary with an other. As though the parsone whiche is coupled vnto him in mariage were decessed.
               
                  But what yf the secōde mariage dyd not by chaunce hym well / so that the one wolde compelle the other / the husbande his wife or contrary wyse / to lyve vngodly / ād after the fassyon of paynemis / vntylle that he shulde come vnto .iij. or .iiij. maryages / shulde yt be lefulle then for a manne so ofte to marye a new wyfe as his olde were soche one as I have spoke of before? so yt he had stylle lyvinge ten wives or elles more that had lefte and forsaken hym?

                   that he was in before / ād hath not in the meane seasone maryed with an other / he maye then receave his firste mate / whiche he was ioyned vnto afore / but dyd departe from him / &amp; not only he maye thus do / but also he ought to be coūcelled so for to do / that they maye love eche other againe and companie to gether / lyke as they did at the firste. But if in the meane space he shall parhappes be maried vnto an other / then ye partye whiche did forsake hyr maryed cō

And vnto this purpose serveth well that is writē of Moses Deuteronom ii. xxiiij If a man be maryed or take a wiffe / to whō he casteth no favoure be cause she hathe some deformite / he shall write a libell of divorsement and geve it her in here awne handes / and so shall let here departe from his house And when she is departed and hath maryed an other husbande / yf he also hate here and will geve her a lybell of dyvorsemente / and so demysse her from his house / or els

For doutlesse yf yt were so done all soche dyvorse and departinge of maryed couples / shulde consequētly be a bated / dymynisshed / and lefte.
               But now when the Pope hath opened awaye for soche runners / ād defendeth their runninge and lewdenesse / gevynge them leave and au

Which Sathan hath sought and studyed to bringe a boute thorow these lawes. But yf both partyes be founde culpable in soche

                   runnynge a waye or departinge: Then yt ys right / that eche of them do forgyve other their offenses / and be reconcyled / and dwelle agayne to gether And this doctrine of Paule extendeth so farre / that yt comprehendeth all manner of dyvorsemente. As when the husbande and his wife departeth a so

                  dre the one frō the other not only bycause of Christian faith / but also for what soever other cause / be yt other for anger or elles for any other displeasure. So that in all soche thinges the



causer of dyvorse ought other to reconcyle hym vnto his maryed mate / or elles abyde vnmaryed: and then the partye whiche is innocente and fautlesse beyng dysmyssed and sette free / shall have power / yf so his mate wille not be pacifyed and come to agremente to chaunge his estate / and mary with an other. For this is vtterly a wycked / vngodly / and hethen maner that maried folkes shuld

                   be separate / and goo awaye the one from the other / for cause of anger or elles of any other fylthy &amp; vncleane thinge / and wylle not rather suffer and take parte to gether of good and evylle / of swete &amp; of sower / lyke as they are boūde to do. Wherfore soche maried people be verely hethen ād infideles.
               God (sayth he) hath called vs in peace / that is to saye / that we shulde spende oure lyfe in reaste and peace. So that a Christyan husbande / or a Christian wife ought not to stryve for cause of faith or vnbyleve / nor yet departe / or go awaye: Yf that the vnbele
                     •
                  er wille not violently pulle the awaye frō godlynesse. But every parsone ought to be suffered to abyde in their awne beleve. The cause therof referryd vnto God. For vnto fayth no man nother can / ne ought to enforce and straine an other. Only god muste drawe mē ther vnto by his grace. And it is requisyte that we do teache / exhorte / ād praye forthe



same / but cōpelle any parsone we maye not Wherfor a Christian &amp; belevinge body ought to lyve peasably with his maryed companion beynge an infidele / or of misbeleve as touchinge the exteriordedes of matrimony and not to dystroble him nother with thretennniges / departinge / ne persecucyon. For God is not causer of stryfe / but of peace As is testifyed Roma .xv. and also in ye .xiiij chapter of this pistle. Therfore doth he not teache stryfe and discorde / but kepeth &amp; preserveth vs all vnto peace. Now sainte Paule procedeth forthe.
            
            
               For howe knowest thou o wō
                  man whether thou shalte save thy husbāde or not? Other howe knoweste thou o man whether thou shalte save thy wyfe or not? But even as god hath distributed vnto every man.
               ¶ That is to saye / ye ought therfore to kepe mutuall peace one with an other in matrimony / ād yt also with your wives or husbandes being infideles (whē they withstāde not / ne let you to byleve and folowe christe) &amp; not to manace / thretne / drive &amp; enforse thē vnto faith. For it is not in your power / ne your dede yt one may come or turne to ye faith of christe

But yf it shall please god thorow yow to save thē / he there vnto shall hel

                  e and ayde yow dealinge his grace ād giftes vnto to yow / whiche are to soche an effecte belonginge. This seameth vnto me the very minde and meaninge of Paule in this place: That he wolde have no parsone enforced other to ye faith or godlines / but one maryed mate to ly

               Thus muste we do with a maryed mate that is an infidele or misbelever / his evyll livynge of vs muste peaseably be sufferyd / nother ought we to constraine him vnto fayth and godlynes / but cur

                  eously bringe him there vnto with softe entreatinge and tranquillite / for paraventure thou art vnworthy that any parsone thorow the shulde come vnto goodnes / or waxe better: But yf thou be worthy god of hys good wille shall gravnte

               As the lorde hath called every parsone / so let him walke. And so ordeyne I in all congregacyons.
               ¶This is the conclusion &amp; summe of this parte of matrimony. In which he entendeth to saye thus: Faith and christianite is so free a thinge that it is bounde to none estate / but is preferred / ruleth / and reygneth in thē all and over them all. Wherfor a man neadeth to chose none estate for to come vnto blysse. But in what so ever estate / and condicyon / the evangly or fayth shall fynde the in / be thou no
                     •
                   adouted but that thou maiste be saved in the same. Therfore that thou shuldeste forsake wedlocke and kepe separate thy silfe from a maryed mate / for cause of faith



or salvacyon / it is not nedefulle.
               And contrary wise that thou shuldeste be coupled in matrimony other with a christiā / or elles with an infidele for cause of faith or salvacyon / is also not nedefulle. And to telle yow at ones in fewe wordes. Yf thou be weddid other with a christiā / or elles with an infidele / thou art therfore nother saved ne condempned. Or yf thou be vnmaryed / thou art lyke wise therfore nother saved ne condempned. For all these thinges are here free and indifferent. But when thou shalte be a Christian / and so lyve / then shalte thou be saved / and yf thou be not a christian / but an vnbelever or an infidele / thou shalte then be damned.
               So do I ordeyne in all congregacyons / that is to saye amonges all Christen parsones / where I do preache the Evangely. For I do not teache yt they shulde forsake their estates / and make troble or debate / but yt they shulde in them continue / and passe the course of their lyfe in peace. Marke here well / &amp; 
                     •
                  hou maiste now see that Paule doth leve here none estate blessed / excepte the estate only of christianite or of a christen body. All other doth he make free. That of them selves they nother make for salvacion ne

                  et fordānaciō: but all they thorow faith be holsome / and thorow vnbylefe hurtefulle or noysome / ād that even when they be beste kepte.



What cā now oure monkes / nōnes / freres / &amp; suche other cloysterers here saye? whiche do magnifye / boste / &amp; coūte their estates as ye gretteste estates of s

               These .ij. sayinges let not a man take vncircuncision / and let him not be circuncised / ought not to be so vnderstande as though Paule dyd forbydde both circuncysion and vncircuncision. For who can observe or kepe both to gether. He shulde then do contraryate to be circuncysed / and also vncircū
                  cised. And he him silfe doth heresaye yt circuncision is no thinge. Which sentēce shulde be contrary vnto this that he sayeth / let him not chose to be vncircūcided / for yf he



ought not to take vncircucision or be vncircuncided / he ought then to be circuncided. How may then circuncision be no thinge? And by this meanes / this saiyng vncircuncision is no thinge shulde repugne with that he sayeth. Let him not be circuncided / for yf he ought not to be circuncided / he muste thē chose vncircuncision / how therfore shall vncircuncision be no thinge? But yow muste vnderstande that he doth not here inhibite / and forfende the estate of circuncision o

                  ste not lyve circuncised. Nother cōtrary wise so to take circuncision / as though by necessite he were so bounde to do Nother of these is worthy of blisse And yet both of them may be suffered with out any charge and grefe of conscience. So that to be borne a Iewe or elles a Gentille that is to saye circūcided or elles vncircūcided doth nother helpe a man to god ne lette him from God. But this cometh only of fayth and vnbyleve.
               
                  Accordinge vnto this ought also be sayed vnto owr people. To be wedded is nothinge / and to be vnwedded ys nothinge / To be maried with an infidele or mis belever is no thige / Also to be maried with a christiā is no thīge. He yt is maried / let hī abyde maried / he yt ys vnmaried let hī not desyer mariage. That is to saye / let hym not suffre his consciēce to be greved / as thowgh he ought other to lyve maried / or elles that he ought to abyde vnmaried. Moreover to be a monke or a frere ys no thinge / Also to be a laye man ys nothynge: To be a pryste ys nothinge. And to be a monke ys lyke wyse nothīge. He therfore that ys a laye mā let hym not be a mōke / And he that is a mō
                  ke let hym not be a laye man: That is to saye let him not thinke that he hath necessite to be the one / or elles the other er make ony stickinge or gradge in conscience by cause he ys this or that: but let him abyde the mā / that he ys / and in the same estate. So that yet 
                     •
                  ys fayth do remayne pure &amp; sure. For where as fayth cā not persever there necessite bī
                  deth as well a monke to departe as an other man / whiche is called awaye and with drawen from Chryste by his wicked maried fellow.
               But here may the Iewes make obiection and laye agaynste Paule. Sayest thou that circumcision is nothinge worthe / but that



the commaundemente of god is all to gether. Circumcysion ys straytly commaunded vnto vs of god: how then doest thou saye yt yt ys no thinge? This ys a longer matter / then yt I cā nowe (accordyng as yt is worthy) speake of. but I have of yt sufficiently wrytten in other places. Notwithstandinge have ye yet now agayne my minde in fewe wordes. All the lawes of Moses were wryttē ād gevē vntylle the comīge of christe / he at hys comynge ought both to teache and also to geve or deale vnto his servantes fayth and love. Where as they be / all the commaundementes and lawes are fulfylled abrogate and made free. So that after the cominge of Chryste no cō
                  maundemente ys any lenger necessary / onles yt concerne fayth and love. Therfore where love shall requyre / I shall suffer to be circūcyded / elles I shall let yt passe. Where charite shall requyre anger / there am I b

What charyte ys / and howe that yt seketh the profyte &amp; pleasure of oure neyghbore ād also what fayth ys / hath ben many tymes shewed in other places.
            
            
               
               Let every man abyde in the same state wherin he wascalled Art thou called beyng a servante? Care not for yt. Neverthelesse yf thou mayste be free / vse yt rather.
               ¶ He doth here repete agayne his conclusyon / puttyng an other example concerninge the same of a servante and a free man. In that tyme many were as one wolde saye not their awne men / lyke as nowe a dayes in certen places besome that hath no power over their awne body / and are comonly called bō

But yet he that is called in this state sayeth the Apostle let thym not care for yt: That ys to saye / It hyndereth hym not from godlinesse / ne letteth in him Christian fayth.

In lyke wyse also here when he sayeth: he that is called in the lorde beyng a seruante is the lordes freeman.

Whiche libertye &amp; egalnesse caused by faith / mennys tradicions do destroye / and avoydinge libertie do combre mennes



consciences bryngynge them in to a strayte. For he that teacheth that a Christen body maye not mary with an vnchristyan and so dwelle to gether (whiche thinge the Popes lawes are not adouted to do) the same letteth and fordoeth thys lybertye that is here ordeyned and spoken of by Paule / and causeth that people do rather obeye them / then God or elles his worde. And thys doth Paule in thys place calle servyce of men / when he sayeth / be not the servantes of men. In so doyng thynke the people / that they be the servantes of God / and do obeye serve and honore him. When not with standynge they attendinge and folowynge the doctryne of men are made only the servantes of men.

And in that ys taken awaye the honor / whiche oure greate preachers have ther vnto a fore thys tyme attributed. For where ys no commaundemente / there ys lefte before god nother meryte ne mede / but a sole libertye. Yt ys of lyke estymacion afore god / and all on matter whether thou be a virgyne or no virgine.

For all these thinges before god are all one nother ys there any difference of persones / ne meryte of dedes / but only fayth whiche ys egalle and lyke in all / and by all thinges.

               Here in have yow both vttered / and also overthrowen the dyvelyshe doctrine of the braynles and dotynge doctores or preachers of the devyll whyche do forge syngular coronettes for nonnes and all virginnes in heven / callinge them the spouses of Chryste. As though other Chrystyan people were not the spouses of Chryste. myserable and folysshe youth hearynge



thys lewde preachinge runneth who maye fasteste covetyng to fylle and replenisshe heven with vyrgines and the spouses of Christe. In the meane season Christian faith ys forgotten and not cared for / but suppressed and quenchidde. Whiche notwithstandinge all only doth finally obtayne this crowne / and maketh the spouses of Christe. But knowe thou well this / and be thou suer that of soche crowned vyrgines (that truste in these doctrines / and by reason of soche opinions do shewe and pretende virginite / dyspysinge / or slenderly regardinge this doctrine of Paule) is not so moche as one founde pure or remayninge a virgine / and fynally that ys a vyrgyne or elles the spouse of Christe.
               Furthermore he sayeth accordinge after his faythfulle and trusty advysemente that virginite is good for this presente necessite. This is the firste cōmendacyon that Paule bringeth of virginite. And here mayste thou see what goodnesse Paule did meane of before in the beginnīge of this chapter / whē he sayede / yt is good for a man not to touche a woman. For he wrytteth not here one worde of merite / mede / or rewarde that we shall have in heven.
               But he spake of transitory goodnes ād cō
                  modites of this lyfe / as here after we shalle see more often. This is then a good cause to



continue in virginite and to eschue mariage whiche is fulle of troble and miseries. That alwaye over the shulders of a Christian body hangeth redy for love of the Evangely persecucyon / and he is every houre as men are wonte to saye sette as it were betwixte ye hāmer &amp; ye stethy so yt he must put in ieoparde hys goodes / his fryndes / &amp; his lyfe other to be dryven &amp; taken awaye / or elles to be slayne. And this doth Paule here calle presente necessite.
               But now where I beseche yow shall one canne finde so moche as one virgine in all the cloysteres of the Popes kingdome (for in soche doth he principallye reygne) yt lyveth a virgine for soche a cause? For then possessions / lyfe / and companye be made so sure / and safe by so many and so grete pryvyledges / and authoritees both of kinges / Emperoures / and of Popes that never a fore vnto this daye was any people in the worlde more safe / or more sure. So that every man muste nedes knowledge &amp; graunte that these do not lyve virgynes for cause of necessite / or of any ieoparde / but only for love of sykernesse / assurance / and savetye / and that no necessite shulde ever touche ne assayle them. Whiche thinge is cleane cōtrarye vnto the cause alledged here of Paule / for yf everywhere in cloysteres &amp; monasteries necessite / and persecuciō shulde be loked for / ye shulde



se expressely that where as now are redy bylded a thousande and a thousande cloysters / shulde vnnethes be one stocke or studde But what shall I nede tarye any longer aboute to declare yow this. It is playnly set a fore the eyes of all mē / what necessyte and perylle cloysteres / their god the pope / with all his officers / mynisters / clyentes / and accessaries do suffer / other in body / or in goodes. They be all in a grosse sume swyne and sowes that are masted / pampered / and fedde delicately.
               But thou wylte here obiecte agaynste me Maried people ought to be in perylle and necessite for the euangely / as well as virgines or vnmaried persones. For as the euangely ys vnto all people comone / so muste also the crosse and persecucion be. For Abrahā was in necessite ād to gether also with

                  him his wife Sara / whiche when he had forsaken hys father and hys goodes or substance was caused to be alwaye put in ieoparde of deth? I make answere. Yet for all that doth not Paule commaunde that any persone fo

                   cause of that necessite shulde te bounde to abyde syngle and vnmaried. But he sayeth ye yt is good and profitable so to abyde. Thys necessite that Paule doth here speake of is a comone thynge. But virgyns be in better case to abyde ād endure yt then are maryed folkes. For yf Abrahā had ben without hys wife



Sara / he shulde have had lesse / troble labore / and care / and shulde in cōclusyon have escapyd with more ease the perylles and ieoperdes yt he was in. A virgyne is onl

Here is faith assayled sharpely / &amp; put vnto no lytill plūge For what a grevous burdon do they bere when they be pinched and wrōge with penury? Beside what a vexaciō is it for thē to beholde the misfortunes that be falle both vnto thēselves / &amp; also vnto their householde &amp; family / with the iopardye yt they do dayly stande in / of losinge both godes &amp; cattelle?

Thus muste he humble hīsilfe moste louly / keping hī quiet &amp; stille / &amp; brouke or disgeste doune many evill vexacions / and that principally because he is bounde in wedlocke with a wife / whiche thinges all he shulde lytelle or nothinge nede to regarde / yf so he were loose &amp; stode free. Forthermore the womānes myserye



and affliction is to bere childer / to be delyvered of them in paine / and to bringe them vp in laboure and travayle / to reste or slepe litelle in the night / to be strayte and harde vnto hir silfe / and to forsake all hir felicite or pleasure. Whiche thinge she shulde have no nede to do / yf she hadde lyved a mayde. And this beside all experience dyd God him silfe shewe vnto Eve in the .iij. chapter of Genesis sayng: In payne shalte thou bere and bringe forth children.

But yet all bondage or lybertye exterior doth stille abyde and remayne / and is nother sinne ne goodnes or merite: but a certē exteryor ordre of thinges in due frame and proporciō of troble and solace / payne ād ioye / lyke a

               Bretherne let every man wherin he is called / therī abyde with God.
               here doth he now the thirde tyme repete his conclusion of christian lybertye. That all exterior thinges before god are free / and that a Christen body maye vse them accordinge after his appetite or pleasure / other levinge thē or elles takinge them. And he addeth expressely / before god. That is to saye as concernī
                  ge vnto thy silfe and vnto God. For thou doest not honor vnto god in this that thou art coupled in matrimony / or elles that thou abydeste vnmaryed / that thou art a servant / or elles that thou art a freman. In that thou art made this thinge or that / or elles doest eate this meate or yt. On the other syde thou doest not displease him / nother doest thou sinne yf any of these thinges thou shalte do awaye and leave dndone. And to telle yow shortly. Thou oweste nothinge vnto god / but fayth and confession / when I bere / saye confession. I meane not that whysperinge of synnes in to ye prystes eare / whiche is called auricular confession / ne yet the confessiō of thy sinnes vnto god / but I meane as sainte Paule doth Roma. x. sayēge: Yf thou shalt knowledge or confesse with thy mouth / that



cause they cōprehēde in thē many other. But yet is all this nother sinne ne offense before god / but only a tēporalle incōmodite / vexacion / &amp; misery the which he muste nedes fele / ye other lusteth or elles by necessite is enforsed to be ioyned in matrimony. And with out doute ye apostle hath therfore here touched these greves / &amp; vexacions of matrimony / lesse ony parsone shulde for cause of thē dispise ye state / as though it pleased not god or in which god could not be served. Like as vnto this daye oure false prophetes have bē wont to do. Whiche have in maner put all worshuppinge of god / &amp; good dedes / out of this state / callynge maryed people / secularlaye / worldely / yee and the very worlde yt silse / and other that lyve vnmaryed / but yet not all chaste spretuall ecclesiasticalle / and the churche. As though they only were spretualle &amp; the churche. And the maryed were not so / but the cōtrary / yee they calle the vnmaried the knightes of god / god dys servantes / the spouse of god &amp; soche other names which it is pitye to se howe farre they be disagreyng frō their dedes &amp; cōdicions. What elles is this then in so avauncinge thēselves in yt they be vnmaried to teache that in mariage mē can not be lyke? Ne do the same that they do beyng vnmaried.

There is difference betwene a virgyn ād a wife. The single womā careth for the thinges of the lorde that she may be pure both in body and also in sprete: but she that ys maried careth for thinges of the worlde / howe she maye please hir husbande.
               ¶Here is shewed an other cōmodite &amp; profite yt cometh of chastite in this worlde. That they maye ye more intētively care &amp; study to do godly thinges &amp; goddes service I meane not in reding / soundīge of organes / &amp; singī
                  ge / like as now a dayes supersticious / religious &amp; cloisterers are wōte to do amōges whō is al y• very service &amp; honor of god suppressed &amp; quēchidde: But that by a blisshed quietnesse a mā may sticke harde &amp; geve diligēte attēdāce dayly vnto ye worde of god in redinge prayng / &amp; alwayes talkinge therof / &amp; finally in preachīge it: accordinge as paule doth exhorte .i.

A maide or an vnmaried body is not distracte &amp; so divided in to diverse charges



or cares / but she may wholy geve hir silfe vnto godly and divine thinges:
               Yet doth not the apostle intende to damne matrimony / though here he saye yt a maried parsone doth not only take care for the worlde: but also that he ys in a maner divided from god / and endureth moche care: So that he can not continually praye / study / or speake the worde of god. For all though truly soche a parsones care &amp; laboure be not evill Neverthelesse it had ben more profitable for him yf he had abydden loose and free both as concerning for prayer / and also for treatinge and speakinge the worde of god / furthermore in vtteringe the worde of God he maye do pro

               ¶This is a moche wonderfulle texte / that a man may gyve his virgyne or his mayde to be maryed only for avoydinge shame or skornīge wich do therof growe / yt in some countrees yt hath be thought vncomly / yf a man shulde kepe hys virgyne vnmaried over longe / or beyonde tyme of mariage. Beholde here as saynte Paule wolde have every persone in thys poynte free / and to do that shulde be good and profitable for them. He sayeth therfore yf so nede requyre / That is to saye / yf it cā be none other wyse / and the manner of yowr cowntry be so / and the custome doth with yow so requyre that yt be shame for a man to reteyne and kepe hys vyrgine vntylle she waxe aged / let hym then do what he lyketh.

grosse and contente of this chapter is: It is good not to mary / excepte necessite constraneth and causeth the contrary. And there is necessite where as god hath not gevē the noble gifte of chastite / for no man ne womā is create vnto chastite: but all ar create / &amp; made to engrendre and begette yssue / and to suffer the troble / and myseries of wedlocke / as ys shewed Genesis .ij. &amp; .iij.

By whiche yf man be not made continent and chaste. I do not denye / but they maye begynne to live chaste: but it shall never come to a good effecte and ende.
