            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            To the right honorable the Lorde
Edwarde Beauchampe, Earle
of Hartforde, W. Baldwyn
wyssheth encrease of vertue,
honor and learnyng.
            
               WHan I had finished
this tretise
(right honorable
lorde)
I thought it
mete accordīg
to the good &amp;
accustomed vsage
of wryters, to dedicate it vnto
some woorthye person, whose
thankful receyuyng and allowyng
thereof, myghte cause it to be the
better accepted of other. And forso
muche as it was not of value to be
geuen to any auncient Counsayler
whiche are all therein sufficientlye

seen already, I iudged it most conuenient
to be geuen to somme that
were yonger: Emong whome for
so muche as your learnyng, &amp; vertuouse
towardnes, was greatlye
commended of dyuers and sundry
credible persons, I doubted not
but that your good disposicion naturally
taken of your vertuous parentes,
woulde take in worthe the
gyft of this simple treatyse, which
although it answer not fully vnto
youre estate, yet disagreeth it not
muche with your age, whiche with
your good report and vertuous disposicion,
hath emboldened me to
dedicate it vnto you rather than to
any other: humbly besechyng you
to pardon myne audacitie herein,
and to take in good parte the simplenes
of my gyfte. In whiche so
doyng, ye shall not onely ensue the

steppes of your honorable father,
whome God for his excellent and
manyfolde vertues, ioyned with
very gentylnes, hath called to the
high office protector of this realme
vnder ouer soueraygne Lorde the
kynges Royall maiestie: but shall
also cause other the more gladly to
desyre it, to the greate encoragyng
of me and other lyke, whiche for
the commoditie of our countreye,
woulde gladly helpe forwarde all
honest and vertuous studyes: Among
whome although I am the
least bothe in age, learnyng &amp; wit,
yet is my good wyll not muche behynde
the formoste.
            And because that your lordshyp
maye the better knowe how to vse
this treatise, and all other of morall
Phylosophie, I haue in my
prologe to the Reader shewed the

ryght vse thereof: wysshyng that
all whiche shall reade the Booke,
shulde fyrst note the Prologe: that
Phylosophye maye haue her
lawfull prayse, the holy
scriptures, theyr due
seruice &amp; reuerence,
and God hys
honor,
worshyp, and glorye: Who
kepe your lordship, with

            ¶The Prologue to the
Reader.
            
               WHan Pericles had
gathered an armye,
makyng expedition
towardes the battayle
of Peloponesus,
whan his nauy
was ready rygged,
and at the poynte to
launche forthe, sodaynly
there chaunced
so great a darknes through an Eclips
of the Sunne, that the daye was as dark
as yf it had bene nyght, in so muche that
the starres appered: at whiche so sodayne
and prodigious a wonder the Pylote beyng
amased and affrayed, as were also diuers
of the souldyers, refused to sayle any
farther. Whiche whan Pericles perceyued,
whether it were in contempte of
Astronomye, or to encorage his astonished
souldyers, be toke his cloke and blynded
there with, the Maryners eyes: and at
the last vncouering them agayne, he asked
hym yf he thought it any wonder because
his eyes had be couered a whyle, and yet
were neuer the worse therfore. And whan
the Pylote answered that it was not: No
more is it (sayde Pericles) althoughe the
Moone shadowyng the Sūne, take away

his lyght for a season. And so contemning
a good admonicion sent as than by god, he
sayled forwarde, to the destruction of hys
souldyers, besydes the great detriment of
all the whole lande of Brecia.
            In lyke maner there be manye nowe a
dayes, which as Pericles despysed Astronomye,
despyse all other sciences: deuysyng
proper toyes (as he dyd) to dasshe
them out of countenaunce, tunnyng headlyng
through Ignoraunce, into contempt
of all good learnyng: Not only inuentyng
tryfelyng toyed, but also wrestyng the holy
scriptures whiche they vnderstand not
to serue for their pyuish purpose. For yf it
chaunce them to be improued with any of
the good sayinges of the auncient philosophers,
which so playnly impugneth theyr
vices, that they be vnable by good reason
to refell it, tha
                  •
                on goeth the brasen face,
and a cloke must be sought oute of Scrypture
eyther to do deface all Phylosophye, or
els to blynde mennes eyes withall: But
yf they vnderstoode the Scriptures, or yf
arrogancie woulde let them learne to vnderstande
them as they be trulye meaned,
than shoulde they, confessyng theyr lewde
and wylful blyndnes, be ashamed of their
many vices, &amp; cease to disprayse that, that
is greatly to be commended.
            
               
For although (Good Reader) that Philosophye
is not to be compared with the
moste holy scriptures, yet is it not vtterlye
to be despised: whiche (yf men wyl credyt
the holy doctours) maye be proued by
the iudgement of S. Augustine, which in
his booke De doctrina Christiana. cap. xl
exhorteth vs to the reading therof, saying
Yf they whiche be called Phylosophers,
specially of Plato his secte, haue spoken
ought that is true, and appertinent to our
faythe, we ought not onely not to feare it,
but also to chalenge it as 
                  〈◊〉
                owne, from
them whiche are no ryght owners therof.
For lyke as the Egyptians had not onely
Idoles and great burdens which the Israelites
did hate and flye, but also vessels
ornamentes, and goodly Iewels of golde
and syluer, whiche the Israelytes departyng
from Egypt, vnder the colour of borowyng,
stole priuilye from them, not of
theyr owne mynde, but by the commaundement
of God, to turne that to a better
vse whiche the Egyptians abused: So in
the doctrine of the Bentyles are not only
contayned supersticious and fayned rites,
with great burdens of vayne labour, all
whiche we Christians followyng Christe
out from among the vnbeleuyng gentiles,
shulde vtterly detest and auoyde: but also
much good learnyng, mete for to serue the

truthe, wyth some moste profytable preceptes
of good maners, wherein are folide
some truthe, howe to worshyp the eternal
and onely God. &amp;c.
            These be the woordes, iudgement, and
councell of that moste holye Doctour concernyng
Philosophie, the whiche yf many
had wel remembred. whiche vnder the
tytle of philosophicall science, haue with
Sophistrie, corrupted the true sense of holy
scripture, neyther shoulde ther haue ben
suche contencion as nowe raygneth euery
where, neyther faultles philosophye haue
bene so muche despysed. Yet thynke not
(Louyng Reader) that I allowe philosophie
to be Scriptures Interpretour, but
rather woulde haue it as an handmayden
to perswade suche thynges as Scripture
doeth cōmaunde. In whiche kynde whan
it is vsed, than maye al the prayses be veryfyed
therupou, with whiche the auncyent
phylosophers haue magnifyed it.
            Emonge whome Demosthenes the moste
famouse Oratoure among the Greciens,
calleth it, namely the moral parte, An inuencion
and gyfte of God. After whome
Licero the mooste excellent aud eloquent
Oratour emong the Romaynes, calleth it
the gyde of lyfe, and the expulser of vice.
            These and many moe lyke cōmendacions
haue ben therto attributed, whiche auaunce

it excedyngly, neyther disagreyng
with the holy Scriptures. Wherfore euery
christen man ought diligently to applye
it, namely the morall parte: whiche God
wrote fyrste in the hartes of men, and afterwarde
wyllyng to haue euerye man to
knowe it, he wrote it in the tables of stone
whiche he gaue to Moyses, promisinge by
hym a rewarde for suche thynges, whiche
before were obserued for vertues sake.
            So that Moral philosophye maye wel be
called that parte of goddes lawe, whiche
geueth commaundement of outwarde behauyour:
Whiche differeth from the gospel,
in as muche as the gospell promyseth
remission of sinnes, reconciling to god, and
the gyfte of the holy goste, and of eternal
lyfe, for Christes sake, whiche promyse is
reueled to vs from aboue, not able to be cō
               prehended
by reason, according to the saying
of S. Iohn. The sunne whiche is in
his fathers bosome hath shewed it to vs.
And as for philosophie is nothyng els but
the obseruyng &amp; eschuyng of such thinges
as reason iudgeth to be good &amp; bad in the
mutuall conuersacion of lyfe, to whyche
god hath promysed a rewarde, and thretened
a punishment: so that the gospel is cō
               prehended
only by faythe, and philosophy
is iudged by reason.
            Reason only was the cause why al the

phylosofers haue so extolled philosophie
whiche consydered that nothiuge was so
requisite and behouefull for mannes lyfe,
as to lyue togyther well and louyngly.
For lyke as lyfe can not be mayntayned
without meate and drynke and other lyke
good gyftes of Nature: no more coulde it
continue long withoute lawes &amp; maners:
the lacke wherof, saynt Iohn in his Epistle
argueth to be the lacke of godlynesse,
saying: Yf we loue not oure neyghboure
whome we see, howe can we saye we loue
God whome we see not? Which texte beyng
well pondered, maketh as muche for
the commendacion of Moral philosophie
as any of saynt Paules do to the dispraise
therof. Wherefore I humblye beseche the
(most gentle Reader) to take in good part
this simple philosopycal treatyse, &amp; so to
vse it as sainct Augustine hath taught vs,
takyng the good, and leauyng the bad, neyther
reuerencyng it as the gospel, neyther
yet despysing it as a thing of no value.
            And sithens the hollye Scriptures are
nowe come to lyght, &amp; Christians haue
professed to followe and fulfyl the same,
hauyng also innumerable blessynges and
rewardes promysed of God, for oure so
doyng: let vs be ashamed that a droppe or
sparkle of reason shoulde doe more in the

Heathen Infidles (as we cal them,) than

                  •
               ll the promyses of God among vs, whi
               
                  •
               he
take vpon vs the name of Christians:

                  •
               nd let vs so end euour oure selues euery
man in his vocation, to vse suche morall

                  •
               ertues, and vertuous behauyours one to
wardes an other, that oure loue
and charitie vsed towardes
our brotherne, maye
testify our fayth
and loue towardes
god.
            To whome be all prayse honor,
and gloyye, for
euer &amp; euer.

Philosophy. Cap. i.
               
                  SOme perhaps, seyng
we entende to speake
of a kynde of Philosophye,
wyll moue
thys question more
curious than necessarye: where &amp;
howe Philosophye began, &amp; who
the enuenters therof, and in what
nation. Of whiche sith there is so
great diuersitie among wryters,
some attrybutyng it to one, &amp; some
to another, as the Tracians to
Orpheus, the Grecians to Linus
the Lybians to Atlas, the Pheniciens
to Ochus, the Perciens to
theyr Magos, ye Assiriens to their
Chaldees, the Indians to theyr
Gymnosophistes, of whiche Buddas
was chefe, and the Italians
to Pythagoras, the Frenche men
to theyr Druides, bryngyng eche
one of them brobable reasōs,

to confirme herein theyr opinions:
It shalbe harde for a man of our
tyme (in whiche many wrytinges
are lost, or at lest hyd) fully herein
to satisfye their question. Neuertheles
for so muche as God hym
selfe (as witnesseth our most holy
scriptures) is the author &amp; beginnyng
of wysedome, ye wisdome
it selfe, whiche is called of the
Philosophers Sophia, therefore
I suppose that god, which alwayes
loued moste the Hebrues,
taught it them first, yf ye aske to
whome, I thinke (as also testifieth
Iosephus) to his seruaunt Abraham,
who being ī Assiria, taught it
both to the Caldees and to the Egiptians.
The sonnes of Seth
were also studious in astronomye
whiche is a parte of Philosophy,
as appered by the Pyllers, wherein
after Noes fludde (whiche they

by theyr graunde father Abraham
had knowledge of) their science was
founde by them engraued: and after
the flud was by Noe, and his
chyldren taught to other nations,
of whiche I graunt that he whiche
euery countrye calleth the fyrst finder,
hath ben in the same countrye
better than the rest: as among the
Egyptians Mercurius trismegistus
or Hermes, whose workes
bothe diuyne and Philosophicall,
excede farre all other that thereof
haue entreted. Neuertheles ye Gretians
(whiche haue ben alwayes
destrous of glory) chalenge to thē
selues the inuention therof, and
haue therin taken great paynes,
naming it first Sophia, and suche
as therein were skilled Sophistes
or wysardes, whiche so continued
vntyll Pythagoras tyme, whiche
being muche wyser than many other

before hym, consideryng that
there was no wisdome but of god,
and that God hym selfe was alone
wyse, he called hym selfe a Philosopher,
a louer of wysedome, and
his science Philosophye. There
were besides these Sophistes, an
other kynde called Sapientes or
Sages, as was Thales, Solon,
Periander, Cleobolus, Chilon, Bias &amp; Pittachus, &amp; thus there were
in all thre sectes, that is to saye,
wysardes whiche were called Sophistes,
and sages whiche were
called sapientes, &amp; louers of wisedome
which were called Philosophers,
all whose science, was Philosophye,
as we may call it natural
wysdome. Of whiche the kinde
called Ionica began in Anaximander,
and ended in Theophrastus,
And thother kynde called Italica.
began in Pythagoras, and
ended in the Epicure.
            
            
               
               ¶Of the partes of Philosophie.
Cap. ii
               
                  PHilosophie is sorted
into .iii. partes, Phisicke,
Ethicke, and
Dialectyke. The offyce
of phisicke is, to
discerne and Iudge of the worlde,
and of suche thinges as are therin:
It is the parte of Ethicke, to
trete of lyfe and maners, and it is
the dutie of Dialectike, that is Logicke,
to make resons to proue
and improue bothe phisicke and
also Ethicke, whiche is moral Philosophye.
Nowe as for Phisicke,
althoghe it altogyther be not frō
our pourpose, for why it cōserueth
ye bodye in health, without whiche
moral wisedome auaileth litle, yet
because it is more than we maye
accomplish, shalbe omitted, and
suche as therein haue delyte,
(whiche all oughte to haue, that

that loue their bodily health) may
rede Galene, Hypocrates, Aristotle,
and other suche, which thereof
entrete plentifully, absolutely, &amp;
perfectly. Logycke also, because
our matter is so playne, that experience
dayly proueth it, shall not
greatly nede for our pourpose,
whiche desire rather to be playne
&amp; well vnderstanded, than eyther
with logicke or rethoricke, to dispute
and garnysh our matter. But
morall Philosophye, whiche is the
knowledge of preceptes of al honest
maners, whiche reson acknowledgeth
to belong and appertayne to
mans nature (as ye thing in which
we differre from other beastes)
and also is necessary for the comly
gouernance of mannes lyfe, shall
here be spoken of: not reasoned to
the tryall, but simply and rudely
declared: yet so, that suche as therin

delite, although not fully satisfied,
shall not be vtterly deceyued of
their pourpose.
            
            
               ¶Of the begynnyng of morall
Philosophye.
Cap. iii.
               
                  NEcessitie as I iudge
(&amp; that not without
cause) was the firste
fynder out of morall
Philosophye, &amp; Experience,
whiche is a
good teacher, was the first master
therof, &amp; taught suche as gaue diligence
to marke &amp; considre thīges,
to teache and instruct other therin:
and because Socrates in a maner
despisyng the other two kyndes
of Philosophy, added this as the
thyrd, &amp; taught it more thā any of
the rest, therfore (because men must
be the begynners of mennes matters)
I assente with Laertius,

to call hym the first beginner therof.
For although euen among the
Atheniences, the Sages, as Thales
and Solon, both spake and
wrot of lyke matter before him, yet
because he so ernestly embraced it,
and equally placed it with the other
twayne, he deserueth well the
glory of the firste beginner therof:
and although he wrote it not in
bokes (for whiche as him thought
he had a lawefull excuse, or rather
a good cause) yet his disciple Plato
hath writen suche thinges of his
teaching, as fewe so fully wrote of
before: whiche was as it is euydent,
many yeres before Iesus the
sonne of Sirache, whose worke we
for the puritie of the doctrine therin
conteyned, reuerence and honour:
which as he hym selfe calleth
it, is a boke of morall wisedome,
thought full of diuinitie, as are

also many of Platoes workes, as
witnesseth Saint Augustine. And
therfore because Socrates was
before Iesus Sirache, I referre
the inuention, I shulde saye the
beginning therof, vnto hym.
As for Salomons workes
are more diuine than morall,
&amp; therfore I rather
worship in hym the
diuinitie, than
ascribe the
beginnyng of moral Philosophie,
wishing al men and exhortyng
them both to learne and to
folowe, those so diuine and
holy workes, vttered
by hym in his boke
of prouerbes.
            
            
               
               ¶Of the kyndes of teachyng of
morall Philososophye. Cap. iiii.
               
                  AL that haue written
of morall Philosophye,
haue for ye most
part taught it, either
by preceptes, counsell,
and lawes, orels
by prouerbes, parables, &amp; semblables.
For whiche cause it may well
be deuyded into. iii. kyndes, of
whiche the first is by councelles,
lawes, &amp; preceptes, of which Licurgus,
Solon, Isocrates, Cato, and
other more, haue written muche.
Councellyng and admonishinge
men to vertue by preceptes, &amp; by
theyr lawes fraying thē from vice.
               The seconde kynde of teaching,
is by Prouerbes &amp; Adages: whiche
kynde, of Philosophers most
commonly is vsed, in whiche they
shewe ye contrarieties of thinges,

ferryng alwaye the best, declaring
therby both the profites of vertue,
&amp; the inconueniēces of vices, yt we
consideryng bothe, maye embrace
the good, and eschue the euyll.
               The thyrde kynde is by Parables,
Examples and Sēblables.
Wherin by esye and familier truthes,
harder thinges &amp; more out of
vse are declared, that by ye one the
other maye be better perceyued &amp;
borne in mynd: whiche waye oure
sauiour Christ hym selfe, whan he
taught ye grosse Iues, any diuine
thing, most commonly vsed.
               Parrables, semblables and examples,
(though differing in sumwhat)
drawe al to one kynde. The
which kynde Esopus moste of all
vsed, alludyng and bryngyng vnreasonable
thinges, to teache and
instructe men, in graue &amp; wayghtye
matters.
            
            
               
               ¶The order of this boke.
Cap. v.
               
                  OF these .iii. kyndes of
morall Pholosophye
last rehearsed, consisteth
this worke, euery
kynde by it selfe
sundred into a boke,
that it maye the better be vnderstande
of all that shall reade the
same, the matter of all whiche thre,
is gathered out of the workes of
the most pure &amp; auncient Philosophers,
and specially of these foloyng.
               Mercurius trismegistus Hermes.
               Pythagoras Italicus.
               Thales Milesius.

               Seneca.
               And for so muche as the good
lyfe of a man, is cause of his better
estimation, the liues of all these
before named, shalbe first shewed
in a boke by thēselues: wherin also,
parte of theyr wyttye answers
are conteyned: whiche is set forthe
onely for thys pourpose, that we

Christians ashamed of our selues,
in beholdyng the lyues of these
Heathen persons, maye amende,
and folowe the good doctrine that
they haue taught vs.
               In the seconde booke whiche is
called the booke of preceptes and
counselles, shalbe declared what
these men thought of god, of the
soule, of ye worlde, of death, of frēdshyp,
of counsell, of silence, of ryches
and of pouertie, wyth theyr
wittie sayinges of, and concerning
the same matters: After whyche
theyr good preceptes orderly shall
followe.
               In the thyrde boke, whiche is the
boke of prouerbes or pytthy sayinges,
shal thinges be shewed worthy
of memorie. In the ende wherof
shal folowe some of theyr principall
sentences, drawen into meter,
to the intent they maye be the

eselyer learned, and better kept in
mynde.
               In in forthe boke, called the boke
of parables or semblables, shall
appeare ye greate zeale yt the Phylisophers
alwayes haue had, to
teache by all maner meanes that
wit might ymagin, this so precious
and nedeful a science, to all kynde
of people. And yf it shall chaunce
that in any of these bookes, thorough
Ignoraunce or Negligence
somewhat shall be misordered, or
not to fully handled as it shulde
be, and as the matter requyreth:
The excuse shalbe yt in this treatise
no perfection is pretended,
and onely is set forth as a shewe,
to make men thereby desirouse,
to haue the perfection of ye thing,
whiche it representeth. And lyke
as a whetstone although it be dull
it selfe, yet causeth instrumentes,

to be more kene
                     •
                  : So by this blūt

to others workes
whiche here
vpon maye

               Nowe the order and intent of the

               ¶The lyues and wittye answers
of the Philophers, and first
of Hermes. Cap. vi.
               
                  FOr as muche as of
all the philosophers,
of whome we pourpose
to wryte, Hermes,
otherwyse called
Mercuriꝰ Trismegistus,
is not onely the most excellent,
but also the most auncient,
therfore as he is most worthy, his
lyfe shalbe first declared: which because
it is not wholly set forth, nor
all agreing in yt whiche is set forth,
therfore geuyng credit to the most
true wryters, it shalbe set furth as
they among them by pyeces haue
preserued it. Of whome saynt Augustine
the worshypfull docter
sayeth.
               Atlas the Astrologian, the brother
of Promotheus the Phisition,

floryshed, and was hyghly accepted,
the same tyme, in whiche Moses
was borne: whiche Atlas was
graundfather by the mother syde,
to Mercurius the elder, whose Nephewe
was this Mercurius Trismegistus,
which in the Egiptian
toūge is called Hermes. Howbeit
some whiche wryte of hym, holde
opiniō that he was Enoch, whiche
as they saye, signifieth the same in
Hebrue, that Hermes dothe in the
Egiptian tong. And so make hym
in the seuenth degre from Adam:
reconyng after this sorte. Adam
begat Sethe, the father of Enos,
the father of Caynan, the father of
Malalael, the father of Matusale
the father of Iareth, whiche is the
father of Enoche. Which opinion
(although it be not to be vtterly reiected)
yet is not sufficient without
profe to be beleued. For Enoche

whome they take for Hermes, was
before Noes flud, in whiche al the
workes whiche were wrytten, yf
they had at that tyme any vse of
letters, were drowned: but ye workes
of this Hermes of whome we
entreate, are yet appearing in dyuers
languages, wherfore it shuld
seme that this was not he, except
we shulde say that he graued it in
the stone pyllers, in which in tyme
of the flud, Astronomye was preserued,
whiche myght well be, and
but that saynt Augustine, &amp; Pamphilus
in his chronicle, and saynct
Ierom thervpon, appoynt ye contrary,
I coulde wel beleue. For
Iamblicus &amp; diuers other, wryte
much of Mercurius Pyllers. And
Mercurius was of suche same among
ye Egiptians, that they put
forth all theyr workes vnder hys
name. And the Poetes for his singuler

learnyng, make hym a god,
&amp; call hym the messenger of Iupiter,
whome they call ye god of heauen
&amp; gouerner of all. And it maye
be, that the pyllers whiche the sonnes
of Seth (of whose image he
was) made, were grauen by hym,
whiche (as many wryte) are full of
learnīg: out of which as testifyeth
Iamblicus, both Pythagoras and
Plato wt diuers other more, learned
Philosophy. But those pillers
I take rather to be hys .ii. goodlye
bookes, whych maye very well
be called Pyllers, for why they
beare both diuinitie, (yf with Lactancius
I maye so call it) and also
Philosophy, whiche were peraduenture
also grauen in Sethes
chyldrens pyllers, &amp; therout drawē
by some that hath ben since. Of
whiche .ii. bokes the firste called
Pymander, is so full of diuinitie,

as may astonysh the wyttes of
suche as therin shal reade: which
causeth. S. Augustine, to doute
whether he spake suche thinges as
he dyd by knowledge of Astronomy,
or els by reuelatiō of spirites.
Howe be it Lactantiꝰ douteth not
to count him amonge the Cibiles,
and Prophetes. The other boke
called Asclepius being but smal,
conteyneth in it the hole sūme of
naturall Philosophye, oute of
whiche I thinke no lesse, but that
the Philosophers haue learned
oute theyr Science. Tully &amp; Lactanciꝰ
(not shewing in what time)
saye that there were fyue Mercuries,
&amp; that this is the fift, whome
the Egipcians call Theuth, and
the greciens Trismegistus, &amp; that
this is he whiche slewe Argus, &amp;
was ruler of the Egipcians, and
gaue them lawes, and instructed

thē in learning, &amp; deuysed markes
&amp; shapes of letters after the forme
of beastes, &amp; trees. He was called
Trismegistus, because he was
the chefest Philosopher, the chefest
prest, &amp; the chefest kynge. He prophesied
of the regeneration, and
beleued the resurrectiō of ye body,
and the immortalitie of the soule,
and gaue his subiectes warnynge
to eschue sinne, thretnyng them
with the iugement of god, wherin
they shuld geue accōptes of theyr
wycked deades. He taught them
also to worship god with diuers
kindes of ceremonies, and taught
them in all matters to make theyr
prayers vnto god, and instructed
the Ylandes in the knowledge of
god. And whan he had lyued into
a perfecte olde age, he gaue place
to nature. Hys preceptes, prouerbes,
and parables, shalbe spoken
of in theyr places.
            
            
               
               ¶Of Pythagoras Cap. vii.
               
                  PYthagoras the Philosopher
borne in
Samia, was a ryche
marchaunt mannes
sōne, called Demarratꝰ,
howbeit he was
richer than his father, whiche was
not able with hys marchandise to
get so muche, as he despised: which
was both riche in abstinence from
couetise, and also in Wysedome,
whiche is the very riches: of which
in his youth he was so desirous,
that he went fyrst to Egypt, and
after to Babylon, to learne Astronomye,
and the beginnyng of the
worldes creation: whiche when he
had learned, he returned īto Crete,
&amp; Lacedemonia, to se Lycurgus,
and Mynoes lawes. In whiche
when he was perfecte, he went vnto
Ceuona, where was a people

excedingly geuen to luxurie, and
all kynde of vice, among whome
he so behaued hym selfe, that he refourmed
them from theyr euyll
maners, &amp; in small tyme brought
them to suche sobrenes, that men
wolde neuer haue thought it had
ben possible. For the wyues, that
were forsaken of theyr husbandes,
and chyldren cast of by theyr parentes,
he so instructed, that they
were receyued agayne. He caused
the women also to set asyde theyr
gorgious attyres, reaching them
that chastitie, was the chefe ornament
of honest women. This
Pythagoras (as sayeth Boetius)
was the inuenter of Musycke among
the Grecians, whiche he
founde out by the soundes of hammers,
wherof he wrot a boke, which
Boetius and Apuleyus, translated
into Latyn. Saynt Augustyne

in his .viii. booke de ciuitate dei,
sayth yt Philosophy was so named
by hym, whiche before was called
Sophia. For whan it was asked
hym what sciencer he was, he answered
a Philosopher, whiche is a
desirer of wisedome: thinking it a
great arrogancie, to haue called
him selfe wise. Tullius sayeth that
Pythagoras spake so wysely, and
so ornatly before Leontius a king,
that he, wondryng at his wyt, and
Eloquence, desyred hym to shewe
what science he knewe best, to whō
he answered, that he knewe no science:
but was a Philosopher. At
whiche, for the newnes of the name
the kyng astonyshed, asked hym
what was a Philosopher, &amp; what
difference was betwene Philosophers
and other men. To whome
Pythagoras sayde. Mans lyfe semeth
to me, to be like a cōgregatiō
                  
of people gathered to see a game,
to whyche men resort for sondrye
pourposes: some by theyr owne actiuitie
to wyn the worshyp of the
game, &amp; other some for lucre sake,
to by or sell somwhat, and othersome
myndyng neyther to gainne
nor to profit, come onely to behold
and se what is done: And in lyke
maner men whiche are come vnto
thys lyfe, as out of an other lyfe &amp;
nature, occupye them selues with
diligence, to get prayse or profit, or
regardyng neyther, apply theyr
mindes to serche and to knowe the
nature of thinges, which sorte last
named, we call Philosophers, that
is to saye louers of wysedome:
Thus by thys goodly parable he
vttred his mynde, in the continuance
wherof also, he prayseth and
proueth his sciēce to be best, sayīg.
Lyke as he which cōmeth to se the

game onely, is more liberalle, ye
and more to be praysed, than the
rest: so lykewyse he whiche in this
lyfe geueth his mynde to wysedome
and knowledge, ought more
to be accepted than any of the rest.
Saynt Augustine sayeth that he
was wel skylled in Nicromancye,
whiche may be very wel, for in that
time it was muche set by, and none
thought wyse, that therin was ignorant.
Ualerius sayeth that hys
hearers worshipped him so muche,
yt they thought it a great sinne to
forget ought which they hearde of
hym, in disputyng any matter.
               His wordes were so estemed that
it was a cause good and suffycient
in any matter, to saye yt Pythagoras
sayde so.
               He was so good a Philosopher,
as scarce any deserueth to be hys
matche. He kept iustice so muche,

that after hys death, the autoritie
of his name ruled the people of Italic,
whiche in tyme past was called
Magna Grecia. He was so
sparyng and profitable, that some
thinke he neuer did eate any daynty
meates. He taught many yong
men, whose aptnes he knewe alwayes
by theyr countenaunce, gesture
and maners. And he with all
his disciples, lyued in common to
gether, as well in loue, as in other
maners. For he taught them, that
true frendship was, to make one
harte and mynde of a greate many
hartes &amp; bodyes. In so muche that
Damon and Pithias whiche were
of his sect, loued so to gether (as
sayeth Ualerius Maximus) that
whan Dionisius the Tyrant wold
haue kylled the one of them, which
desiring licence to go and dispose
his goodes before his death, was

graunted his request, yf he coulde
get another in ye meane whyle that
wold be his pledge, who yf he cam
not agayne at ye tyme appoynted,
shulde dye for hym: his felowe not
regardyng hys lyfe, so muche as
hys true frendeshyp: became his
pledge. And the other beynge let
go, came agayne at his tyme appoynted,
to redeme his felowe frō
his death: whiche faythfulnes in
bothe the tyraunt Dionisiꝰ scing,
not onely forgaue them bothe, but
also desyred that he myght be the
thyrde of that felowship, that had
rather dye than to fayle in frendshyp.
A notable example of most
constant frendshyp, and of good
instruction therin. To one that asked
him what he thought of womens
wepyng, he sayde. There are
in a womans eyes, two kyndes of
teares: The one of grefe, and the other

of deceyte. To a couetous mā
he sayde: O role thy ryches are lost
vpon the, and are very pouertye,
for why thou art neyther the warmer,
better fed, nor richer for them.
It was axed hym yf he desyred to
be ryche, to whiche he answered
naye, saying: I despyse to haue
those ryches, whiche with lyberalitie
are wasted and lost, and with
sparyng, do rust and rot. To one yt
was gaylye apparelled, and spake
vncomly thinges, he sayde: Eyther
make thy speche like vnto thy garmentes,
orels thy garmentes lyke
vnto thy language. It chaunced a
fole in Pythagoras presence, to say
that he had rather be conuersant
among women, than among Philosophers,
to whiche he sayde: yea,
swyne had rather lye rowtyng in
durt &amp; in draffe, than in clere and
fayre water. Beinge asked what

newe thinge was in the worlde, he
answered: nothinge.
               Beyng asked what was Phylosophye,
he sayd: The meditation or
remembraūce of death, labouryng
daylye to get the soule libertye in
this pryson of the bodye.
               He was the first among the Grecians
that helde opinion that the
soule was immortall.
               He kept scole in Italie, and lyued
in to a greate age, and after
that he was dead, the people reuerenced
hym so muche, that they
made a temple of hys house, and
worshypped hym as a god.
He florished in the tyme of Nabuchodonoser,
kynge of
Babylon. Hys preceptes,
prouerbes, and
parables, shall folowe
in theyr
places.
            
            
               
               ¶Of Thales Milesius.
Cap. viii.
               
                  THales (as sayeth Herodotus,
Democritus and
Duris) had to his father
a noble mā, called Examius,
and to his mother Cleobulina,
of the stocke of Cadinus &amp; Age
nor: and was borne (sayeth Plato)
vnder D
                     •
                  masiꝰ prince of Athens,
and is the fyrste that euer was called
a Sage, or wyseman.
               He florished at Milerum what
tyme Oseas was iudge ī Israel, &amp;
Romulus Emperour of Rome:
what time Scnnacherib king of ye
Chaldees, sent the Assirians to inhabit
Iurye, whiche after the coū
                  tyng
of Eusebius, was thē. 4450.
yeare frō the creation of the world.
               This Thales was very well
learned, bothe in Astronomye and
Phisicke: &amp; wrote manye goodly

workes, &amp; was a citizen at Miletum,
as Phalerius wryteth, and
was come of a noble linage, who
after he had dispatched hys busines
belonging to ye cōmon weale,
gaue him selfe to the searchynge
out of naturall causes. And surely
he was a profitable counsayler to
the common weale: For whan as
Cresus demaunded to haue had
his felowes, he wolde not graunt
to it, which afterward whā Cyrus
had gotten the victory, was cause
of sauynge theyr citie. Heraclides
sayeth that he lyued solitarilye,
but some saye he toke a wyfe, and
had a childe called Cidistus, and
other saye that he lyued chaste all
his life long: &amp; whan it was asked
him why he wold not get children,
he answered, because he wolde not
be bound to loue them. Whan hys
mother cryed on hym contynually

to take a wyfe, he wold say he was
to young: and afterwarde whan
hys youth was past, and hys mother
still importunate, he wolde
saye it was out of seasō, &amp; to late.
               He woulde saye alwayes he
was bounde to thanke Fortune,
but forthre causes chefely: first because
he had reson, and was not a
beast: secondly because he was a
man, and not a womā: thyrdly because
he was borne a Gretian and
no Barbarian. He sayde there was
no difference betwene deathe and
and lyfe, and beyng axed therfore
why he dyed not, because (ꝙ he) I
shulde than make a difference:
when he was asked whether god
knowe mens euell worckes. Ye (ꝙ
he) and theyr thoughtes to. To an
aduowtrer that axed hym whyther
he myght sweare that he was no
aduouterer, he sayde. Pariury is

not worse than aduoutry. whan he
was asked what thīg was hardest?
He answered: A man to knowe him
selfe: &amp; what was esiest? He sayd to
admonyshe other, what was sweatest?
For a mā (sayth he) to vse that
he hath: what is god? That that
lacketh be ginnyng and ende. And
whan he was asked what was the
most difficill &amp; seldest sene thinge?
               He answered an olde Tyrant. A
selde sene thinge in deade, for god
eyther taketh them awaye before
they be olde, orels in theyr olde age
chaungeth theyr hartes, beyng demaunded
howe a man myght best
suffre aduersitie? To se (sayde he)
his enemies in worse plyght than
hym selfe. It was axed hym howe
we myght lyue best and most righteously?
to whiche he answered: to
flye those thinges our selues which
we reproue in other. Beynge axed

who was happye, he sayde: he that
hath his bodyly health, is fortunate
in riches, not of a vayne mind
but learned. These are part of hys
wittye answers, his preceptes, prouerbes,
&amp; semblables, shalbe spokē
of in their places. This Thales as

lviii. Olimpiade, and floryshed in
Cresus tyme, to whome he promised,
that he wolde cause the ryuer
Alm, to rūne backwardes agaynst

this name as testifieth Demetrius,
Duris, &amp; Dionisius, but thys
Thales Milesius the sage, beinge
olde, &amp; worne in age, dyed of heate
&amp; thirst, whiles he beheld a triūphe.
Some saye that as he went forth
of his house to beholde the starres,
he fell doune sodaynlye into a pit,

and was therfore mocked of an
olde wyfe that he kept in his house
with this saying: O Thales howe

canst not se suche thinges as are

               ¶Of Solon Salaminus. Ca. ix.
               
                  LYke as there is amōg
writers great variaunce
(as I sayd before)
about the firste
Philosopher, euen so
is there greate contention whiche
were the seuen sages: but as theyr
variaunce maketh doutfull which
were the persons, so theyr hole cō
                  sent
assureth that there were suche.
And for because we entend, not so
muche to shewe the persones and
names, as theyr good doctrine,
therfore it shalbe sufficient that a
wyse and approued Philosopher

hathe sayde suche thynges as to
thē are attributed, yet as for good
causes, I haue allowed Socrates
for ye first morall Philosopher, after
Lacrtius mynd, 
                     •
                  o do I best alowe
Lacrtiꝰ Iugement in this matter,
which saieth yt these wer they: Thales,
Solon, Periander, Cleobulꝰ,
Chilon, Bias, and Pittachus.
               Of whome althoughe Periander
were a tyrant, yet because yt for hys
good doctrine he hath of the learned
longe tyme bene allowed, therfore
shall he enioye that, whiche
they haue geuen hym.
               Of Thales ye haue hearde alreadye,
after whōe Solon is next,
whiche was the sonne of Existides,
and was borne in Salamina, and
therof was called Salaminus. He
gaue many good lawes, and dyd
many worthy deades, worthy to be
remembred: Among whiche this is

very notable. After that the Athemences
and Megarences, had
made greate warre and greate
slaughter betwene them, to haue
had the signory of hys countrye
Salamina, and were bothe sore
weryed wyth warres, they made a
lawe at Athens that no mā payne
of hys head, shulde speake or perswade
ought to chalenge the Ylande,
any more. Than Solon beynge
troubled and thoughfull for
hys countrey, fearyng least wyth
holding his peace, he shuld do smal
good to the common weale, and
agayne if he shulde speake, it shuld
be for his hurte, sodaynly fayned
him selfe madde: thinkyng therby,
not onely to speake, but also to do
suche thinges as were forbydden.
And disguisinge hym selfe
                     •
                   he ran
abrode amonge he hartles people,
And there in the maner of a cryer

he perswaded the people yt whiche
was forbydden, &amp; styrred vp theyr
myndes so much, that incontinent
they began warre to obtayne the
Yland, and so at last they got it. He
perswaded them also to chalenge
Chersonesū a citie ī Tracie, affirming
that it was theyr ryght. And
by this meanes so wan the peoples
loue, that they gladly wolde haue
made him Ruler: but as sayth So
sicrates, he had a neyghbour called
Pisistratus whiche tyranously
endeuoured to hurte hym, whiche
as sone as he knewe, he armed him
selfe and went into the streate, and
whan he had called a greate company
about him, he discouered Pisistratus
treason, and not onlye
that, but also that he was readye
to amend it, &amp; that he wolde fyght
for his libertye, saying.
               
                  
Ye men of Athenes, I am wyser
then some, &amp; valianter then other
sōe. I am wiser thā those yt marke
not Pisistratus, and I am valianter
than those, whiche knowe him
and dare not for feare shewe what
he is: But the Senate that toke
Pisistratus parte, sayde he was
mad, and whan he sawe he coulde
haue no redresse, he layde downe
his harneys before them, &amp; sayde.
O countrey I haue alwayes holpe
the bothe with word &amp; deade: And
then sayled into Cipres, and there
met with Cresus, who demaūding
of him whome he thought happy,
he layde: Thelus of Athens, and
Byto, and suche other, whiche all
all mē spake of. Another time whā
Cresus had garnished hym selfe
rychelye, and was set in his highe
trone: he asked hym, yf euer he had
seene a more gorgious sight, ye (ꝙ

he) both Capons, Fesantes, and
Pecockes, for their goodly colours
are naturall. From Cresus he wēt
into Cilicia, and there buylded a
citie, and after his owne name, called
it Solos. He made many good
lawes for suche as were warriers,
yf any had got victorye, he shulde
haue a greate rewarde for hys labour,
and suche as were slaine, had
theyr wife and children founde of
the common purse euer after. He
made a lawe, yt no executour shuld
dwell with any orphans mother,
nor that any shulde be executour
to whom after ye heyres death his
goodes shall belonge. And that no

                     •
                  yng or seale maker shulde kepe ye
print of any 
                     •
                  olde seale. And that
who so euer had put out a mannes
eye, shall lose bothe his owne for
it. And yt whosoeuer toke oughte
that was not his owne, shulde dye

for it. And that yf any gouerner
were founde dronken, to dye for it.
And that no man shulde geue any
dowry with his daughter: with
many mo good lawes. Whan he
was demaunded why he made no
lawe against soche as kylled theyr
father or mother? He answered,
because it is a desperat mischife.
Being demaūded howe mē might
best kepe them from breakyng the
lawe? he sayde: yf suche as haue no
wronge be as sory and and carefull, as
those that are wronged. He wolde
saye to riche men: Aboundaunce
groweth from riches, and disdayne
out of aboundaunce. He wrote many
bokes, both of verses, lawes, &amp;
other matters, besides many goodly
epistles. He florished in the .xlvi.
Olimpiade, and was prince of Athens
the .iii. yeare whiche was
from the worldes creation .4605.
                  
yeares, he lyued .lxxx. yeares▪ and
dyed in Cipres, commaunding his
s
                     •
                  ruauntes to 
                     •
                  ary his bones to
Salomina, and there beyng made
in poulder, to sowe them aboute
the citie. Dioscorides writeth that
when he was asked why he wept
for his sonnes death, sith it profited
him nothing? He answered
euen for this cause I wepe, because
I can profit him nothing. Thus
muche of his lawes, and answers:
the rest of his sayinges shal be spoken
of, in their places.
            
            
               ¶Of Chylo Lacedemoniencis.
Cap. x.
               
                  CHylo the sonne
of Damagetus,
was borne in
Lacedemonia.
He wrote many
verses, &amp; helde
an opinion that

man by reason, might comprehend
the foreknowlege of thinges to
come, by the myght and power of
his manhode. There were in his
tyme (as sayeth So
                     •
                  icrates and
Pamphilia) diuers offyces: of
which one was most noble, and
the officers called Ephori, which
were kinges folowes: Wherfore
his brother being angry because he
wolde not take that office, sith he
him selfe had bene in it before: O
brother (ꝙ he) I can suffre wrong,
and so canst not thou. This man
(as Herodotus writeth in the first
boke of his histories) seyng on a
tyme Hipocrates sacrifice and vessels
in Olimpo, to burne without
helpe of fier, counselled him, either
to lyue chaste, or yf he were maryed,
to put away his wyfe, &amp; sley his
children. Some saye yt when Esop
(whiche was in his tyme) asked

hym what Iupiter dyd, he answered:
he mekeneth the myghty and
exalteth the lowelye: Beynge demaunded
wherin ye learned differed
from the ignerant, he answered:
In theyr good hope. To hym
yt asked what was harde, he sayde:
to kepe close secrete counsayle, to
kepe a man from ydlenes, &amp; to suffre
wronge. He lyued so well, that
whan he was olde, he sayde that he
neuer in his lyfe to his knowlege,
had done any euell, saue that on a
tyme whan he shoulde haue bene
iudge among his frendes, &amp; wolde
do nothyng contrary to the lawe,
he perswaded one to appele from
him to some other iudge, that therby
he myght bothe kepe the lawe, &amp;
also his frende. The Grekes reioysed
in him muche, because he prophecied
of Citherea, an ylond of
Laconia. For when he had well

aduised, both the nature and situation
therof: wolde to god (ꝙ he)
that eyther thys ylond had neuer
ben, orels that it had ben drowned
as sone as it was sene: A worthy
&amp; prophet lyke sayeng. For Demaratus
flyeng from Lacedemonye,
coūsayled Xerxes to kepe a nauy of
shippes in that ylond. And surely
yf he had periwaded him therto,
he shulde haue got great riches by
Gretia. And afterwarde Niceas,
(after he had warred at Peloponesꝰ)
ouercame yt place. And made
it a refuge for the men of Athens,
and afflicted sore the Lacedemoniens.
He was brefe in communication,
in so muche that brefe spakyng
was of his name, called Chilonia.
He was olde about the .li.
Olimpiade. In whiche tyme Esopus
ye oratour was in his flowers,

whiche was in the yeare from the
worldes creation. 4624. he dyed at

               ¶Of Byas Prienneus. Cap. xi.
               
                  BYas Prieneus,
(as sayth
Diogenes,)
was borne
in Priena.
Hys fathers
name was
Teutamiꝰ.
Satirꝰ 
                     〈…〉
                  
hym the first of the seuen
sages. And many gesse that he was

                     〈…〉
                  . Phanodicus wryteth
that he redemed many wenches of
Messena, whiche were captiues &amp;

brought them vp as his owne
daughters: and afterwardes, geuing
them dowries, sent thē home
agayne to theyre countreye, vnto
theyr frendes. Not long after, certayne
fishers found a golden trestell,
on whiche was wryten, Sapienti,
that is to saye, this is for a wise
man. Whiche when the forenamed
wenches fathers hearde of, they
sayde Byas was a wiseman, and
sent it him, but whan he sawe it, he
sayde Apollo was a wiseman, and
that he sent it hym. We fynde that
when his countrey Priena was besiged
of Aliattes, he fed two mules
for the nones, insomuche that they
were exceding fat, and draue them
forthe into his enemyes tentes:
whiche whā Aliattes sawe, he was
amased, thynkyng by the fatnes of
them, that they had great plentye
of all thinges. And thinkyng to areyse

the syege, he sent a messenger
into the citie, to serche the truth.
               And whan Byas perceyued the
kynges entent, he made many gret
heapes of sand to be couered with
wheate, &amp; shewed them to the messenger:
whiche whan the kynge
knewe, thinkynge that they had
had great plenty of vitayles, made
peace with them, and sent cōmaundement
to Byas to come vnto him,
to whiche Byas answered: I commaunde
the kynge to eate ony
                     •
                  ns
and to wepe. He wrote about .ii. m.
verses. Being asked what was difficill?
he sayde: to take in good
worth aduersitie after prosperitie.
O natu
                     ••
                  e he sailed among wicked
men, and whan the ship was sore
shaken with greate tempest, and
those wicked men called vpon god,
peace (ꝙ he) that he se you not sayling
from hence. To a wicked man

that asked him what was goodnes,
he gaue no answere. And whā
he asked why he answered him not,
he sayde: because thou enquirest of
that, whiche pertayneth not to the.
He wolde saye yt he had rather be
iudge among hys enemies than amonge
his frendes, for of his enemies
he shulde make one his frend
but amonge his frendes he shulde
make one his foe. Beyng asked in
what dede a man reioysed most, he
answered: whā he gaineth. He was
a good oratour, and when he was
very olde, as he pleaded a cause for
one of his frendes, after he had
done his oration, beyng weary and
faynt with speakyng, he rested his
head in hys neces lappe, whiche
was his daughters sonne: and
whan his aduersary began afresh
and had fynyshed, and the iudges
had geuen theyr sentence on hys

syde, whose part Byas toke, assone
as the iudgement was ended, he
was found dead in his nephewes
bosom, which buried him worthely.
And the citizens of Priena, dedicated
a chapell to hym whiche is
called Teutonium. He wolde saye
alwaye the greater part are euell.
The rest of hys sayenges shalbe
spoken of, in theyr places.
            
            
               ¶Of Periander. Cap. xii.
               
                  PEriander as sayeth Heraclides,
was borne in
Corinth, his fathers
name was Cipcelus, he
maried a wyfe called
Licydes, whiche was ye daughter
of Procleus, a tirant of Epidaur,
and by her had two sōnes: the one
called Cypselus, and the other Lycophrone,
of whiche ye yonger was
very wyse, but thelder was a fole.
This Periander was well learned

And wrote a boke of .ii. M. verses,
neuertheles he was a Tirant, &amp; excercised
so muche his tyranny that
al men did hate him: he was about
the .xxxviii. Olimpiade in Solons
time. And he executed his Tiranny
xl. yeares. Some saye there were
two Perianders, thone a tyrant, ye
other a Philosopher, which might
well be: neuerthelesse this Tyrant
is he, whome Laertius reckneth
for one of the seuen sages, whose opinion
I allowe not. For lyke as
he for his euill doctrine disaloweth
Orpheus to be a Philosopher, so I
for his euyl liuyng disalowe Periander,
to be any of the leuen sages,
althoughe he haue written many
wise sayinges. For as ī Philosophy
nothing is lesse alowed than ignoraunce,
so in wisedome nothing is
more abhorred than Tiranny, in
which this Periander excelled, in so

muche that whan he was demaunded
why he continued in his tyrany?
because it is daūgerous (ꝙ he)
for a man to yelde him selfe eyther
of his owne accorde, or els against
his wyll: Neuerthelesse he wolde
saye (as wicked Hanniball sayed
of peace) that who so wolde rayne
in suerty ought to endeuour them
to haue theyr subectes obediente
with loue, and not with force. And
pet he him selfe sought nothing
lesse. For one a time he beyng very
angry, flong his wife being great
wt childe downe a payre of staires,
and trode her vnder his feete, and
so kylled her. And sent away his
sonne Lycophorna, bycause he
mourned for his mother, &amp; draue
him vnto Corcyra. And afterward
whan he him selfe was very olde,
he sent for him agayne: that he
might with his owne handes play

the tyrant with him: whiche when
the men of Corcira knewe, they
put him to deathe them selues, to
delyuer him from his fathers tyranny.
And whan Periander
hearde that, ragyng in his fury, he
toke all theyr chyldren, &amp; sent them
to Aliattes a tirant to be slaine: but
whan ye shippe wherein they were
approched vnto Samos, they vowyng
to Iuno, were saued of the
Samnites: whiche whan Periander
hearde of, he beyng .lxxx. yere
olde, what with sorowe, and what
with woodnes, died. This was his
life, whiche shulde not haue ben
rehearsed, saue that for his good
sayinges, whiche shalbe spoken of
in theyr places. Neyther wolde we
that any man shulde take example
hereby, but rather shulde se howe
shamefull it is for a Christian, to
haue the like conditions.
            
            
               
               ¶Of Anacharsis. Cap. xiii.
               
                  ANacharsis the Scithian
was ye sonne of
Gnurus, brother to
Caduidus kynge of
Scithia. But hys
mother was a Grecien.
By reason wherof he was learned
in bothe the languages, and
wrote much bothe of ye Scithians
and Greciens lawes, and also of
warres &amp; marciall affayres. Sosicrates
sayth that he was at Athens
in ye .xlvii. Olimpiad vnder
the Prince Eucrates. And Hermippus
sayeth that he wente to
Solons house, and when he was
at his gate, that he bode one of
the house, to tell Solon that Anacharsis
was without, and that he
desired greatly yf he myght, to be
hys gest, and haue hys acquayntaunce:
whan ye seruant had tolde

Solon, he sent hym worde agayne
that he made gestes of hys owne
countrey folkes, whiche whā Anacharsis
hearde, he went in boldlye,
and sayde. Nowe am I in my cuntrey.
And whan Solon sawe hys
wyt &amp; wysedome, he admytted him,
not onely for a gest, but also for a
pryncypall frende.
               He had thys one goodly saying,
worthy to be noted. The vyne bringeth
forth .iii. grapes, the firsste of
pleasure, ye second of dronkennes,
and the thyrde of sorowe. Beynge
asked what shoulde cause a man
most to be sobre, he sayde: to behold
se, and remembre the filthy bestlines
of dronkardes. Beynge on a
tyme in a ship, after that he knewe
it was but .iiii. ynches thicke, he
sayde that they were nyghe death
that sayled. Beynge asked what
shyp was most sure: yt (ꝙ he) that

cummeth safe to the hauen: whan
he was demaunded whether there
were more dead then alyue? he asked
in whiche syde he shulde count
mariners. Beyng vpbrayded of a
man of Athens, because we was a
Scithian: in deade (quod he) my
countreye is a reproche to me, but
thou art a reproche to thy coūtrye.
To one that asked hym yf a wyseman
myght mary a wyfe? he sayde
what thynkest thou that I am? &amp;
when the other affirmed yt he was
a wyse man, wel (ꝙ he) I haue maryed
a wyfe. When he was reproued
of fearfulnes, he sayde yt hys
fearfulnes caused him to abstayne
from sinne. To a womā that sayde
he was foule and ylfauoured, he
sayde: thou arte so foule and fylthye
a myrrour, that my bewty can
not be sene in the. When it was axed
hym why wysemen woulde aske

counsayle? he answered: for feare
of mingling theyr wylles wt theyr
wyttes. To a paynter that was be
come a phisitiō, he sayd: The faultes
that thou madest before in thy
workes myght sone be espyed, but
them that thou makest nowe, are
hyd vnder the yearthe. For dead
mens diseases are buried wt them.
               Beyng asked what was bothe
good and euyll to a man, he answered:
the tonge. He wolde saye that
ye market was a place appoynted
for men to deceyue in, and to apply
them selues to auaryce. To a
yong man yt was hys gest, whyche
slaūdered him, he sayde: wel young
mā yf whyle thou art young, thou
canst not suffre wyne, whan thou
art olde, thou must be content with
water. He was the firste (as some
thynke) yt inuented the anker. He
was long tyme wyth Solon, and

thence returned into his owne coū
                  treye,
&amp; there intendyng to chaūge
theyr lawes, and to haue established
ye Greciēs lawes, was slayne
of hys brother wyth a shaft, as he
rode on huntyng: and whan he felt
hys deathes wounde, he sayde: I
haue bene preserued in Grecia, by
wysedome and learnynge, but at
home and in my country, I perishe
throughe enuye. Some wryte that
he was slayne, whyle he was sacrifisyng
after the maner of the Gretiēs.
The rest of his sayinges shall
be spoken of in theyr places.
            
            
               ¶Of Myson. Cap. xiiii.
               
                  OF this Misō is great
variaunce amonge
writers, &amp; al through
the doutiulnes of Apollos
answere: For
whan Anacharsis axed of Apollo
who was wyser than he? he answered:

Ecius, Myson, Cheneus, but
some saye that Apollo sayde not
Ecius but Eteus: and so they aske
what Eteus is. Parmenides sayth
it is a village of Laconia, in whiche
Myson was borne. But Sosicrates
sayth, that his father was
called Eteus, and his mother Cheneum.
Euthyphron sayth that he
was of Crete, and that Heraclides
Ponticꝰ was his father, but Anaxilaus,
sayth that he was of Archadia:
thus there is cōtrouersy about
him, in whiche I allowe best Sosicrates
mynde. But after that Apollo
had geuē this answere, Anacharcides
beynge troubled ther wt,
came vnto Mison, in the Sommer
tyme, and founde him makynge a
share for hys plowe, and mockyng
him therfore, sayde: Ywys Myson
it is no mete tyme to go to Plowe
now: No (ꝙ he) but is mete inough

to prepare &amp; make it readye. He lyued
solitarylye, and whan a man
by chaunce met hym laughyng to
him self, &amp; axed him why he laughed
so, sith no mā was presēt there
wt him, he answered: Euen therfore,
do I laughe. He wrote many goodly

               ¶Of Epimenides. Cap. xv.
               
                  THeopompus saythe that
Phestius was Epimenides
father. Other saye yt
Dosiades was, other some saye Age
                     •
                  iarchꝰ.
He was borne in Crete
ī a strete called Gnosꝰ. This Epimenides
beynge on a tyme, sent of
hys father, into the countreye, to
fetche home a shepe, about nonetyde
as he trauayled wt the sheepe
on his neeke, beyng weary, he wēt
into a caue, and slepte .lvii. yeare.

And whā he waked, he sought for
the shepe, and because he coulde
not fynde hym, he went backe
agayne into the fyelde, and whā he
sawe that all thinges were chaunged,
beyng greatly astonished, he
returned to ye towne: and whan he
wolde haue entred into hys owne
house, they asked who he was? and
whā he sawe his younger brother,
he was so olde yt he knewe him not:
but at last after much cōmunication
he tolde his brother al that had
chaunced him: which whan it was
noysed abrode, euery mā toke him
for one high in goddes fauoure.
Wherfore on a tyme, whan as the
Atheniences were plaged with the
pestilēce, &amp; were coūsayled of Apollo
to pourge theyr cytie, they sent
for Niceas &amp; him vnto Crete, who
whan he was cume to Athēs, purged
it in this maner. He toke shepe

both white and black, and brought
them into a shepecote, and suffred
them to go thence whyther they
wolde: commaundyng them which
folowed them to sacrifice them to
god, in the place where they firste
laye downe: which done the plage
ceased. The Atheniences delyuered
thus from destructiō, gaue him
a great sūme of money and also a
ship to cary him againe into Crete,
but he forsaking theyr mony, onely
desyred theyr frendship: and so departed.
Alytle after that he was
come home he dyed, beyng .cxcvii.
yeres olde as sayeth Phasgo, but
as his countrey folke say, he liued.
299. yeres. He wrote many workes
in prose &amp; in verse, of whiche somwhat
shalbe shewed in their places.
Some thinke yt he died not at that
age, but fell aslepe agayne vntyll
an other tyme.
            
            
               
               ¶Of Anaxagoras. Cap. xvi.
               
                  ANaxagoras was an
excedyng well learned
man, and came
of a good stocke: his
fathers name is Eubulus,
he was very
witty in Philosophy, And wrote
muche therof. He was of a noble
courage &amp; very lyberall: For why
he gaue away all his patrimony.
And whan his frendes reproued
him therefore, &amp; sayde that he toke
no care for his goodes: what nede
I (ꝙ he) sith ye take care therfore.
At last he went from them, and
gaue his mynde altogether to the
study of Philosophye, regardyng
neyther the common weale nor yet
his owne profit: insomuche that
one asked him yf he regarded not
his countrey? to whome he answered,
yes: the chefest thing that

I care for, is my countrey: poynting
with his finger, towarde the
heauen. He was in Xerxes tyme,
And beganne to treate of Philosophy
at Athens (as sayeth Ualerius)
whan he was but .xx. yere olde,
and taryed there .xxx. yeres. He
sayde that the Sunne was made
of burning Yron, and that there
were mountaynes and vallayes in
ye moone. Some sayde that he told
before of a stone yt fell from heauen
in to the flud Egis. To one
that asked him yf the mountaynes
Lampsaceni shulde euer be parte
of the seca? yes (ꝙ he) yf the tyme
fayle not. Beyng asked for what
entent he was borne, he sayde: to
beholde the heauen, the sonne, and
moone. To a man yt was very pensiue
and heauy, because he shulde
die in a straunge coūtrey, he sayde:
be of good chere frend, for the way

that goeth downe to hell, is euery
where.
               Sylenus wryteth that in prince
Dimilus tyme, there fell a stone
from heauen, and that Anaxagoras
therthrough held opinion that
Heauen was made of stones, and
that but for the great compasse of
the buyldyng, it wolde sodaynly
fall. Sotion sayth that he was
accused for this &amp; suche lyke matters,
and lost muche of his gooddes
therfore, and was banisshed.
But other wryte that Thucidides
accused him of treason, and he
beyng absent, was therfore condemned,
at whiche tyme also hys
children dyed. And when it was
tolde him howe he was condemned,
and his children dead, as touching
his condemnation, he sayde:
nature hath geuen lyke sentence
both of my condemners and me.

And as touching his children, he
sayde: I knowe that I begot mortall
creatures: neuerthelesse afterwarde
he was saued by Pericles,
and departed from Athens vn to
Lampsacum, and being .lxii. yeres
olde, dyed there. Beyng asked of
ye citie, yf he wolde haue any thing
done for him: he wylled that the
same moneth in whiche he died, the
children of the towne shulde yerely
playe: And that they shulde kepe
yt custome for euer: whiche graunted,
they buryed hym honorably,
and set vp a goodly Epitaphe vpon
his tumbe. His goodly sayinges
shalbe spoken of in theyr places.
            
            
               ¶Of Phericides. Cap. xvii.
               
                  PHericydes the sunne of
Badis (as saythe Alexander)
was a Sirian
borne, and was an hearer
of Pittachus. Theopompus

affirmeth hym to be the
first that euer wrote of nature, and
of the goodes among ye Gretians.
Many marueyles are wrytten of
him. For as he walked by the sea
syde at Samos, behowldyng a
shyppe saylyng swyftly with full
sayles, he prophesied yt wtin a lytle
whyle, it shulde be drouned: And
as he sayde, it came to passe euen
in his owne sight. After yt he prophesied
(as ther was in dede) that
the thyrde after, there shulde be an
yearthquake. Not long after whā
he was at Massena, in the game
place, he counsayled one Perilaus
a straunger, to get him thence, and
all his householde, with as muche
spede as myght be: whose coūsayle
he not regardyng, was taken not
long after with the towne, &amp; all of
his enemyes. He wolde saye to the
Lacedemoniās, that neither golde

nor syluer ought to be worshipped
and yt Hercules in his slepe gaue
hym that commaundement, which
Hercules also the same tyme, commaunded
the Princes to obeye
Phericides: Some apply thys to
Pythagoras. Hermippus sayth
that whan there was great warre
betwene the Ephesians and Magnesians,
he beyng desirous that ye
Ephesians might wynne the victory,
asked one that passed by, of
whence he was: whome confessing
him selfe to be an Ephesian, he cō
                  maunded
to drawe him by the legges,
and to laye hym in the Magnesian
fyelde saying: desyre the citizens
that whan they haue got ye
victory, that they bury me (whiche
am Phericides) in this same place:
whiche when the citizens knewe,
they were in good hope of victory.
And the next daye, they ouercame

ye Magnesians in battaile, &amp; foūde
Phericydes dead, and buryed hym
honorably. But some saye that he
flonge hym selfe downe headlyng
from an hyll called Coriciam, &amp; so to
haue died, &amp; to be buryed at Delos.
Othersom say, that he dyed, beyng
cōsumed wt lice. Aristoxenus sayeth
yt whan Pithagoras whiche cam to
visit him, demaunded howe he dyd,
yt he puttyng his fynger out at the
dore, sayde: beholde thy selfe, which
answere afterward among learned
mē became a by worde. He wrote an
epistle to Thales, wherin he prophecied
of his owne deathe, saying
yt he swarmed full of lyce, and that
he had a fyuer, and whan any of his
frendes axed howe he dyd, he shewed
them his lowsye fynger out thoroughe
the dore, and desyred them
that the next daye after they shulde
come to hys buryall.
            
            
               
               ¶Of Socrates. Cap. xviii.
               
                  SOcrates (as saythe
Plato) the sonne of
Sophroniscus, a Lapidarie,
&amp; his mother
Phenareta, a mydwyfe,
was borne at Athens: a man
of a wonderfull wyt, and as some
say, was an hearer of Anaxagoras
and of Damon. But Duris sayth
that he was a seruant, and that he
graued in stone, and that the Gracie,
thre goodly ymages, were of
his caruyng, wherfore Tymō calleth
hym a caruer of stones, and a
vayne Greke Poete, and a subtyll
oratoure, For in hys orations, he
was sharpe and prompte, &amp; was
therfore forbydden to teache it, by
30. Tyrantes, as saieth Xenophon.
But (as sayth Fauorinꝰ,) he wyth
hys disciple Eschines, opened the
feeldes of the oratorye crafte. He

got money to fynde hym selfe with
al, by his handye worke: frō which
Crito delyuered hym, bycause of
his wysdome, and became his scholer
as Byzantius sayth. But after
that Socrates perceyued yt there
was no frute in the speculation of
naturall Philosophye, &amp; that it
was not greatly necessarye to the
outwarde maners of lyuynge, he
brought in ye kynde called Ethicke
that is morall Philosophye, and
taught it dayly both in ye shoppes
and stretes, and exhorted the people
chiefly to learne those thinges,
whiche shulde instructe thē in maners,
whiche were nedefull to be
vsed in theyr houses. He vsed somtyme
through vehemencie of hys
communication, to shake his hād,
and styr his fynger, yea &amp; to plucke
hym selfe by the heare also, &amp; was
therfore mocked of many, whyche

he suffered paciently. And was so
pacient, that whan one had spurned
hym he suffered hym: &amp; beynge
axed why he stroke not agayne? he
asked yf an asse had kycked hym,
yf he shulde kycke agayne. Whan
Euripedes had geuē hym a worke
of Heraclitus to rede, and asked
hym what he thought by it, he answered:
suche thinges as I vnderstande
are very misticall, and so I
thynke those be whiche I vnderstande
not: But suerly they lacke
some Apollo to expoūde them. He
toke greate care in the exercise of
hys body, and he was of a comely
behauyour, he was also a good
warryer, for whan Xenophon was
in the warre fallen from his horse,
he caught hym, &amp; saued hym. Another
tyme whan the Atheniences
fled all awaye hastely, he him selfe
went leyserly alone, lokyng backe

oftentimes priuely, and watchyng
to reuenge hym, yf any man wyth
his swearde durst venter to inuade
his felowes: he warred also by sea,
and whā he had valiaūtly fought
&amp; ouercome his enemyes, he gaue
wyllyngly the victory to Alcibiades,
whome (Aristippus sayeth) he
loued greatly. He was of a constāt
mynde, and of inuincible reason, &amp;
excedyng carefull for the common
weale, he was also thriftye and cō
                  tynent.
Whan Alcibyades wolde
haue geuen hym muche lyme and
sande to buylde hym an house, he
sayde: yf I lacked shoes, and thou
woldest geue me an hole hyde, to
make me a payre, shulde I not be
mocked, yf I toke it? When he behelde
many tymes the multytude
of thynges yt were solde, he wolde
saye, Good lorde so many thinges
there be that I nede not. He wolde

saye commonly that golde, sylke,
and purple, and other suche thynges,
were more meete to set forthe
tragedyes, than necessary to be vsed.
He lyued so sparely &amp; temperatly,
yt many tymes whē there were
plages in Athēs, he onely hys selfe
alone, was neuer sicke. Aristotle
sayth that he had two wyues, the
first Xantippe, of whom he begat
Lamprocles: &amp; thother Mirtone
Aristides daughter, whōe he tokē
without any dowrye, of whome he
begatte Sophroniscꝰ, and Menexenus.
Satyrus and Hieronimꝰ
Rhodius saye, that he had both at
ones. For the Atheniences beynge
cousumed wyth warres, and morayne
of people, to augmēt ye citie,
decreed that euery mā shulde haue
two wyues: the one a citizen, &amp; the
other what he wold, to beget chyldren
of bothe: whiche Socrates

dyd. He depysed greatly suche as
were proude &amp; hygh mynded, and
wranglers. He gloryed greatly in
pore fare. And sayde yt suche were
most lyke vnto god, as lacked fewest
thinges. He had a great gyft
bothe in perswadyng and also in
diswadyng. For he (as sayeth Xenophon)
perswaded a yong mā which
was Merciles and cruell, agaynst
his mother, to reuerence her: he diswaded
also Platos brother, which
was desyrous to haue come into
the common weale, &amp; caused hym
to leaue of, because he was rude &amp;
ignorant in thinges. Beyng asked
what was ye honour of young mē?
he answered: to attempt nothynge
to muche. To hym that asked hym
whether it were better to marye or
no? he sayde: whiche soeuer thou
do, it shall repent the. He wolde
saye that he wondred muche at mē
                  
whiche with great diligence, endeuored
to carue and make stones
lyke men, &amp; toke so lytle heade to
them selues, that they both semed,
and were lyke vnto stones. He exhorted
yong men to beholde them
selues oft in a lokynge glasse, to ye
intent that yf they were bewtifull
and well fourmed, they shulde do
suche thynges as becommed theyr
shape: but and yf they were ylfauoured,
that they shuld with learning
and good maners hyde theyr
deformitie, whan he on a tyme had
bydden many riche men to diner, &amp;
his wyfe Xantippe was ashamed
of the small preparaunce that he
made, he sayde: be cōtent wyfe, for
yf oure gestes be sober and honest
men, they wyll not despyse thys
there, &amp; agayne yf they be ryotoꝰ
and intemperate, we shall be sure
they shal not surfet. He sayde some

lyued that they myght care, but he
dyd eate, that he myght lyue. Beyng
on a tyme reuyled, and asked
why he spake nothyng? because (ꝙ
he) that which he speaketh, pertayneth
not to me. O that men coulde
nowe adayes so take suche matters.
An other tyme whan it was
tolde him yt one had spoke euell by
hym, he sayde: he hath not learned
as yet to saye well. Whan Alcibiades
tolde hym he could not suffre
the frowardnes and skoldynge of
Xantippe, as he dyd: no (ꝙ he) but
a can, I am so vsed therwith, caust
not yu at home suffer thy gaggeslyng
gese? Yes (ꝙ Alcibiades,) for
they lay me egges, mary ꝙ Socrates,
&amp; so doth Xantippe bryng me
forth chyldren. On a tyme whā his
wyfe in ye open strete plucked his
cloke frō of his backe, &amp; some of
his acquaītaūce coūsayled him to

haue stroke her therfore, he sayde:
ye syrs ye saye well, that whyle
we were brawlyng and fyghtng
togyther, euery one of you myght
crie: now to it Socrates, Eya well
sayde Xantippe, the wittyest of the
twayne. He counseled yt men shulde
so go to their wiues, as horsemē do
to theyr fyerce horses, and with a
prary similitude, he coloured his
pacience, saying: lyke as an horce
being brokē of an horce keper, suffereth
euer after any man to ryde
vpon him, so I by vse of Xantippe
can suffre all other folke. Fynally
he dayly saying and doyng suche
thinges, was praysed of Apollo to
be the wysest man that lyued: At
whiche dyuers beyng displeased,
and because that he proued somme
whiche thought them selues very
wyse men, to be very foles: they
not content, conspired against him,

and accused hym, saying. Socrates
breaketh ye lawes of the citie which
haue ben geuen of our elders, supposinge
that there are no goddes:
and bryngyng in other newe spirites:
(For Socrates helde opinion
that ther was but one god, whiche
was without begynning &amp; ending,
whiche had made and gouerned,
all thynges, and that the soule of
man was immortall, and that euery
man had .ii. spirites assigned him
by god, whiche he called demones,
of whiche he sayde that one shewed
hym thynges to come, wherefore he
despysed theyr goddes and wolde
not worship them) &amp; agaynst tyght
and lawe he corrupteth our youthe:
wherefore let hym dye. Whan thys
was put vp agaynst hym. Lysias a
Philosopher wrote an Apologie for
hym, whiche whan he red, he sayde:
Lysias the oration is good and excellent,

but surely it is nothing mete
for me (for why it was more iudiciall
than shulde seme mete for a Philosopher)
and whan Lisias demaū
                  ded
of hym sith it was good, why it
was not mete for hym, he sayde:
Garmentes &amp; shoes maye be bothe
good and fayre, &amp; yet vnfit for me.
but while he was iudged it is sayde
that Plato stode vp in his defence, &amp;
could not be suffered. And so he was
condemned by .lxxx. iudges, and cast
into prison: For whom the prince of
Athens was very sory, but the centence
whiche the iudges had geuen
vpon him, whiche was yt he shulde
drynke poyson, coulde not be reuoked.
The kyng had a ship frayght
with sacrafices whiche he offered to
his ydols, whiche than was abrode
and he wolde neuer geue any sentence
vpon any mannes death, before
it came to Athens. Wherefore

one of Socrates frendes called Inclites,
counsayled him to geue a certayne
summe of moneye to the kepers,
to let him scape away secretly,
and so to go to Rome, but Socrates
sayde he had not so muche: Thā
sayde Inclytes, I and thy frendes
haue so muche, whiche we wylle
gladly geue to saue thy lyfe, yf thou
wilt. To whyche Socrates answered:
I thanke you and my frendes
but syth thys citie wherein I muste
suffre my death, is the natural place
of my byrthe, I had rather dye here
than els where: for yf I dye here in
my countrye without deseruyng,
onely because I reproue theyr wickednes,
and theyr worshipping of
vayne ydols, and wolde haue them
worship the true god, yf these men
of myne owne nation persecute me
for saying and maintaining truthe,
euen so wyll stranngers wheresoeuer

I become: for I wil neuer spare
to say the truthe, and surely straū
                  gers
wolde haue lesse mercye on me
than myne owne countreye folkes.
Beying thus mynded, he contynued
styll in prison, teaching his scholers
which resorted to him, many thīges
both of the composition of elementes,
and also of the soule: but wolde
wryte nothing, for he sayde that
wysedome ought to be wrytten in
mennes hartes, and not in beastes
skynnes: neuertheles his disciple
Plato wrote welny all yt he taught.
A litle before he shulde be put to
death, he desired that he might bath
hym selfe, and saye hys orations,
whiche he dyd, and called his wyfe
and chyldren, and gaue them good
instruction: And whan he went towarde
the place where he shulde fynish
his lyfe, his wyfe went after
hym, cryinge: Alas my husbande

dyeth gyltles: to whome he sayde,
why woman woldest thou haue
me dye otherwyse? and sent her awaye.
So when the cup of poyson
was delyuered hym to drynke, hys
frendes begāne to wepe, wherefore
he blamed them, sayinge: I sent away
the wemen because they shuld
not do as you do. Than Pollidotus
profered hym a precious garment
to dye in, to whom he sayde:
hath not myne owne cote serued me
to lyue in? why than maye it not as
well serue me to dye in? And than
after he had commended his soule
to god, he dranke the confection, &amp;
as he was in trauayle of death one
of disciples sayd, O Socrates
well of wisdome, yet teache vs sumwhat
whyle thy speche lasteth: to
whome he answered: I can teache
you none otherwise now dying, thā
I taught you in my life time. Thus

finished he his most godly life, being
lxx. yeres olde. His goodly sayinges
shal be spoken of in theyr places.
            
            
               ¶Of Xenophon. Cap. xix.
               
                  XEnophon the sonne of
Grillus was borne an
Athens, he was shamefaste,
&amp; exceding bewtifull.
It is sayde that
Socrates met hym
in a narrowe laue, and wold not let
him passe tyll he had answered him
to dyuers questions: and whan he
axed hym, where men were made
good and bad, at whiche he stayed,
and could not tell: Socrates sayed,
cum with me, and learne. And so he
did, untill suche tyme as he went to
Cyrus, whose fauour he obteyned
&amp; became in great reputation with
him, and wrote all his actes, he had
a womā also called Philesia which
folowed him: of whome he had two

children. He had much trouble in
his lyfe, and was banished, &amp; fled
from place to place, till he came to
Corinth: where he had an house.
And whan ye Atheniences, entended
to succoure the Lacedemonians,
he sent his two sonnes called
Diodorus &amp; Grillus to Athens,
to fyght for the Lacedemonians:
from whiche battayle Diodorus
returned, without doing any great
feate: but Gryllus fyghtyng manfully
amonge the horsemen, dyed
about Mantinia. And when Xenophon
(whiche was doyng sacrifice
with his crowne on hys head)
hearde that his sonne was ded, he
put of his crowne, and when he afterwardes
hearde, that he dyed
fyghtyng valiantly, he put it on agayne,
not so sory for his death, as
ioyous for his valiantyse. He dyed
at the citie Corinthum as saieth

Demetrius being very olde: a man
both good and valyant, expert in
tydyng and huntyng, and greatly
skilled in marciall affayres, as appeareth
by his workes. He was
also religious, &amp; muche intentyue
about sacrifice, &amp; was
a folower of Socrates.
He wrote .xl. bokes intytled
euery one by
a sondrye name:
&amp; Tucidides
workes
which
by
negligence were lost, he brought to
light. And was him selfe so pleasaūt
in his style, that he was called the
muse of Athens. There were
more of this name, of whom
this is the chiefe, whose
good sayinges &amp; preceptes
hereafter
shalbe touched.
            
            
               
               ¶Of Aristippus. Cap. xx.
               
                  ARtistippꝰ, (as sayeth
Elchines) came
to Athens, to heare
Socrates, whose excelent
wysdome was
spoken of euery where. But whan
Socrates was dead, he flattered
Dionisius, and became a courtier.
He was a merye wytted fellowe, &amp;
coulde forme him selfe mete to all
times and places, in so muche that
Diogenes called hym the kynges
hounde. whan he on a tyme had espyed
Dyogenes gatherynge herbes,
and makyng potage, he sayd:
yf thou Diogenes couldest flatter
Dionise, thou shuldest not nede to
make wortes. To whome Dyogenes
sayde: yf thou also couldest be
content to eate and gather wortes,
thou shuldest not nede to flatter
Dionise. Whē one made his boast

that he had learned much, he sayd
that learnyng consisted not in the
greatnes but in the goodnes. To
one that made greate bragges of
his swymmyng, he sayde: Art not
yu ashamed to boast of this whiche
euery Dolphin can do? Beyng reproued
because he hyred a rethoricien
to pleade hys cause, he sayde:
whan I make a banket I hyre a
coke to. When his seruaūt whiche
iourneyed with hym, was tyred wt
the wayght of the moneye whiche
he caryed, he sayde: that whiche is
to heauy cast out, and that whiche
thou canst, carye. Byon sayth, that
as he sayled, perceyuynge that he
was in a Pyrats shyppe, he toke
his moneye and counted it, &amp; than
(as against his wyll,) let it fall out
of his hande into the sea, &amp; mourned
for it outwardelye: but sayde
inwardly to hym selfe, it is better

that thys be lost of me, that I be
lost for this. Dionisiꝰ commaunded
that all his seruauntes shulde
daunce in purple robes, whyche
Plato woulde not, saying: I wyll
not put on a womans garmēt, but
Aristippus dyd, and whan he beganne
to daūce, he sayde: in dronken
feastes, the sober offende not.
It chaunced that he sewed to Dyonisius
for a frende of his, and beyng
denyed, fell downe before his
fete, &amp; whā he was reproued therfore,
he sayd: I am not in ye faulte,
but Dionisius, whiche hath eares
in his fete. This &amp; many lyke answers
he gaue, whiche who so listeth
to rede, maye loke in ye Apothegmes
of Erasmus, where he shall
fynde ynough: whiche because it
appertayneth not greatly to oure
pourpose, we wyll omyt, &amp; entrete
of his good preceptes &amp; prouerbes
in the places thereto appoynted.
            
            
               
               ¶Of Plato. Cap. xxi.
               
                  PLato the sonne of Aristō
&amp; Periander, of Solōs
kinred, was borne at Athens,
in the yere &amp; daye
that Apollo was borne, as witnesseth
Appollodorus. Whiche was
in the .lxxxviii. Olimpiade, &amp; dyed
being .lxxx. and .4. yeres olde. It is
sayde that whā he was borne, there
came a swarme of bees, &amp; hyued in
his mouthe, which Socrates sayd
to be a signe of his great eloquēce.
He was a goodly mā of person as
sayeth Alexander, and was therfore
called Plato, which some saye
was for hys eloquence, and some
for hys greate forhead. He excercysed
him selfe ī his youth, in wrastlīg,
&amp; suche lyke feates: &amp; gaue his
minde also to payntīg, &amp; to wryte
Poesies, meters, and tragedyes.

He had a small voyce and an eloquent
tonge. Socrates dremed yt
a swanne let fall an egge, whyche
hatched in his lappe, and whan it
was fethered, it flue vp on hygh, &amp;
song exceadyng swete songes: and
the next daye whā Platoes father
brought hym to schole to Socrates,
O (ꝙ he) this is the swan that
I dreamed of: and whan he had
learned muche, &amp; shulde come before
Dynonyse to a schole game,
wherein learned men shulde showe
theyr goodly meaters, &amp; pyththy
wrytynges, wherin who that excelled
had a great rewarde: when he
had hearde Socrates declare his,
Plato flong his owne into ye fyer,
sayinge: O fyer, Plato hath nede
of thy helpe. And whan Socrates
was dead, he went into Italye, to
Phylolaum, which was of Pythagoras
secte. From thence he went

into Egypt, to heare the preestes &amp;
the Prophetes, where beynge sore
sicke, he was healed by one of the
preestes, with sea water, by reason
wherof, he sayde: The sea ebbeth &amp;
floweth all maner diseases: He
sayde moreouer that all the Egyptians
were Phisitians. He determined
also to go to ye Magicians,
but by meanes of the warres that
were in Asia, he chaūged his purpose,
&amp; returned to Athens: where
he abode, and wrote many goodly
workes: and drewe togyther Heraclitꝰ,
Pithagoras, and Socrates,
reasons. And in sensible thinges
he preferred Heraclitꝰ: and in
thinges that pertayned to intelligence,
he toke Pythagoras parte:
and in ciuill matters and morall
Phylosophy, he estemed most his
master Socrates. And drue these
thre partes of Phylosophy ī to one

bodye. Satyrus sayeth yt he gaue
an hundred pounde to Phylolaū,
for .iii. of Pythagoras bokes. He
sayled thryse into Sicil to se the
countrye: whereas Dionisius the
tyrant Hermocrates sonne, cōpelled
hym to talke wyth hym, &amp; when
Plato in his cōmunication, sayde
that a tyrant ought not to do that
whiche was for his owne profit, except
he excelled in vertue, the Tyraunt
beynge angry therwythall,
sayde: Thy wordes sauour of olde
ydle dottrels tales. And thyne also
(ꝙ Plato) of a yong tyrant. For
whyche this tyrant woulde haue
slayne hym, but was entreated otherwyse,
and commaunded hym
to be solde. And by chaunce there
was one Annicer, a Cyreniake,
whyche gaue thyrtye pounde for
hym, &amp; sent hym to Athens amongest
hys frendes: whiche incontinent

sent hym his moneye agayne,
which he in no wise wolde receyue,
allegyng that other men were as
worthy to care for Plato as they.
And when the tyraunt hearde how
Plato had sped, &amp; was in his coū
                  trye
agayne, he wrote vnto hym,
prayīg him not to speake or wryte
euell of hym: to whyche request,
Plato wrote agayne, that he had
not so muche ydle tymes as to remembre
hym. Some saye, yt whan
the captayne Cabria whyche was
gyltye of deathe fled, that he (whē
none els of ye citie durst) wēt wyth
hym. And whā Crobylus a scoffer
sawe hym enter into the castell wt
him, he rayled on him, saying: thou
goest to healpe another, as though
thou knewest not that we all redye
owe the Socrates poyson. To
whome Plato sayde, whan I warred
for my country, he suffered peryll

wt me, wherfore now for frend
shyps sake, I wil do as muche for
hym. To one whome he reproued
for playing at dyse, whiche sayde
thou chydest for a small matter, in
dede (ꝙ he) the thinge is small, but
the customable vse therof, is no
small thing. To one of hys boyes
which had displeased him, he sayd:
yf I were not angrye, I wolde
trymme the. To one of his seruaū
                  tes
which had done amisse, and excused
him, saying it was my desteny,
I could do none otherwyse, he
sayde: excuse thy selfe no more thā,
for it is thy destinie also to be punyshed.
He dyed in the scholes
as some saye, beynge broken
in the myddes, &amp; was
buryed in Athens. His
notable sentēces
shalbe added in
theyr places.
            
            
               
               ¶Of Xenocrates. Cap. xxii.
               
                  XEnocrates the sonne
of Agathenor, beyng
borne in Calcedonie,
was Platos scholer,
euē from his youthe.
He was blunt wytted, and slowe,
insomuche that Plato speakynge
of hym and Arisstotle, woulde say
that the one had nede of ye spurre,
&amp; the other of the brydle. He was
graue and earnest, and drye in his
communication. He was muche in
the scholes, and yf at any tyme he
went in to the towne, boyes &amp; tolyshe
people wolde crye after hym
for the nones, to anger hym. He
was so chaste, that whan men for
the nones had hyred an harlot to
meddle with him, which lying with
him many nyghtes coulde not obtayne
her pourpose, she sayde he
was an ymage and no man. Whē
                  
hys fellowes woulde cast into hys
bed Layis, (which at yt time was
the fayrest strumpet in Athens)
when she wolde entyse hym wyth
her moste whoryshe conditions,
he wolde cut hys owne members,
because she shulde not ouercome
him. Beyng sent wt other Embassadours
to Philip, whan all the other
take rewardes, and banqueted
with hym, he wolde not: In so
muche, that whan Philip many
tymes wolde talke with him, he refused:
For whiche cause Philip admytted
hym not for an Embassadour.
And when he wyth the rest
of his felowes was returned to Athens,
they sayde that he went wt
them in vayne. And when (accordyng
to the lawes) he shulde therfore
paye a forfayt, he counsayled
ye rulers to take good hede to ye cō
                  mon
weale, sayinge yt Philip with

gyftes had corrupted all the other
Embassadours, but coulde not
make hym graunt, by any maner
meanes: which (they hearing) estemed
him more thou euer they dyd
before. Beyng sent an other tyme
to Antipater, to redeme the prisoners
whiche he had taken in battayle,
Antipater desyred hym to
dyne with hym, whiche he denying
sayde: I come not to dyne &amp; banket,
nor to take pleasure with the,
but to redeme my felowes frō the
sorowes whiche they suffre wt the:
&amp; when Antipater heard the wisedome,
and sawe the constant mynd
of the man, gently entertaynynge
him, deliuered his prisoners. Whā
Dionisius in his presence sayde to
Plato, some bodye shall take from
the thy head, he sayde: yt shall they
not except they take awaye myne
fyrste. He lyued holylye and wrote

excedyng many goodly workes: &amp;
dyed beyng .lxxxii. yeres olde. His
goodlye counselles shalbe spoken
of in theyr places.
            
            
               ¶Of Archelaus. Cap. xxiii.
               ARchelaus ye sonne of
Seuthꝰ (as sayeth
Appollodorꝰ) was
a good Philosopher
and verye studyous
in Platos workes. He was first an
hearer of Antilochus, a Mathematycke,
and afterward of Theophrastus.
He was a verye wyttye
felowe, and of a prompt spirit, and
graue in communication, &amp; muche
excercised in wrytynge, &amp; gaue hys
mynde to poetrye. He delyted so
muche in Homer, that euery nyght
before he slept, he wolde rede somwhat.
He learned geometry of Hipponicus,
&amp; was thereto so dull, &amp;
yet so well learned in ye crafte, that

he wolde saye that geometry fell
into his mouth as he gaped. Hearyng
men singynge meaters that
he had made, ylfauouredly, he kicked
them on the sydes, sayinge: ye
breake myne, and I wyll breake
poures. Being called to a sicke mā
perceyuyng that he was sicke for
thought &amp; lacke of ryches, he conueyed
vnder hys pyllowe a sacke
full of money, whiche he fyndyng,
was so ioyouse that he recouered
strayt wayes. Whan he was byd
to solute a ryddle at a banket, he
sayde that ye chefest poynt of wysedome
was, to knowe to what pourpose
the time was meatest. To him
that asked him why many scholers
of euerye secte became Epicures,
but none of the Epicures became
of other sectes, he sayde: because yt
cockes were made of men, but neuer
men of cockes, or as some saye

capons be made of cockes, but neuer
cockes of capons. Beynge reproued
because he chalenged not a
yong man, whome he had ryght to,
he excused hym pretely, saying: It
is not possible, to drawe softe chese
with an hoke. Beynge asked what
mā was most in trowble, thought,
and care, he sayde. He that desyreth
most to be at quyet, and rest:
beyng asked whether it were better
to marye a fayre woman or a
fowle, he answered: yf thou mary a
foule one, thou shalte haue gryefe
with her, but &amp; yf thou take a fayre
one, she shall make the cuckolde.
He called olde age the hauen of
all tribulations. He sayed it was
a great euell, not be able to suffre
euyll. To an enuyoꝰ mā which
was verye sorowfull, he sayde: I
knowe not wel, whether euel haue
chaunced to the, or good to an other:

signifying therby, that enuyous
mē are as sorowful for others
prosperitie, as for theyr owne aduersitie.
As he sayled among theues,
by chaūce they met with shippes
of true folke, which the theues
espyinge, sayde: we maye
chaūce to dye yf we be knowen: and
so may I (ꝙ he) yf we be not knowen.
These &amp; suche lyke answers
he gaue, &amp; dyed at Athens when he
was. 80. yere olde, beyng ouercome
wt to muche wyne. And was reputed
more among the Atheniences,
than any other of
the Philosophers. His
piththy prouerbes
shal be spoken of
here after.
            
            
               
               ¶Of Aristotle. Cap. xxiiii.
               
                  ARistotle, the sonne
of Nychomache, a
stagerite, was welbeloued
of Amintha
King of Macedonie,
bothe for his learning,
&amp; also for his wysedome. He
was Platos disciple, and passed far
all the rest of his felowes, he had a
small voice, small legges, &amp; small
ryes, he wolde go rychely appareled
with rynges and chaynes, mynionly
rounded and shauen. He had
a sonne called Nichomache by an
whore. He was so well learned, yt
Phylip Kynge of Macedonie sent
for hym to teache his sonne Alexā
                  dre,
who because he reproued hym
to muche, caused hym to dye. But
Appollodorus sayeth that he came
to Athens agayne, and kept the
scholes there; &amp; dyed whan he was

lxiii. yere olde. He was an excellent
good Phisition, and wrote therof
many goodly workes. He vsed to
washe hym selfe in a basen of hote
oyle: and vsed to cary a bladder
full of whote oyle at his stomacke.
He vsed also whan he slept, to hold
a ball of brasse in his hande, with a
pan vnder his bed syde, that whan
it fell it myght walte hym. Beynge
asked what vauntage a man might
get by lying, he answered: to be vnbeleued
whan he telleth truth. Many
tymes whan he enueyed agaynst
ye Atheniences, he wolde saye yt they
had founde out bothe frutes and
lawes, but knew howe to vse neyther
of them. He wolde saye that ye
rotes of lyberall sciences were bytter,
but the frutes verye swete. It
was tolde hym that one rayled on
hym, to whiche he answered: whan
I am awaye let hym beat me to.

Beyng asked howe muche the learned
differed from the ignorant, he
answered: As muche the quicke dyffer
from the dead. He wolde saye yt
learning in prosperitie, was a garnishing:
&amp; in aduersitie, a refuge. To
one that boasted that he was a Citizen
of a noble citie, he sayde: bost not
of that, but se that thou be worthy,
to be of suche a noble citie. Beyng
asked what was frendship, he sayd:
one soule dwelling in many bodies
Beyng asked what he had got by
Philosophy, he sayd: I can do that
vnbydden, whiche some can scarce
do, compelled by the lawe. Beyng
rayled on to hys face, &amp; not regardyng,
and the rayler askyng hym
whyther he had touched hym or no?
he sayde: Good lorde, I mynded ye
not yet. Being reproued because he
gaue wages to one that was scarce
honest, he sayde: I geue it to the mā
                  
and not to hys maners. Thus and
suche lyke he spake, and wrote many
goodly bokes, of which we haue
(thought not the one halfe) yet so
muche as in our age is thought sufficient
for one man to haue knowen
and written, out of whiche his most
pith thy prouerbes for our pourpose
shalbe be added in place most conuenient.
            
            
               ¶Of diogenes. Cap. xxv.
               
                  DIogenes as sayeth
Diocles, was borne
in a towne called Cinope,
his father beyng
called Icecius
Mensar, who beyng
imprisoned for counterfetyng theyr
coyne, Dyogenes whiche was of
counsell with hym, fled: and came
to Athens, where he met with Antithenes:
whome vnwyllyng to
receyue him (for why he neuer wold

teache any) he ouercame with hys
perseueraunce. And when his master
on a tyme toke vp a staffe to
beate hym, he put vnder his heade,
saying: stryke, for thy staffe is not able
to dryue me away, so long as
thou canst teache me ought. He lyued
simply as one that was out of
hys countrye, and comforted hym
selfe muche with beholdyng the lytle
mouse, whiche neyther desyred
chaumbre, nor feared the darke, nor
was desyrous more of one meate
than of an other: whose nature as
nygh as he coulde, he folowed. He
ware a double cloke, and made him
a bagge, wherin he wrapped hym
whan he slept, and put therin hys
meat, and vsed one place for all purposes:
bothe to eat, to slepe, and to
talke in. Whan he was diseased he
wente with a staffe, whiche afterward
he caryed with him alwayes

not onely in the citie, but also in all
other places. He wrote to one to
make hym a cell, whiche because he
taried longe for, he toke a barrell or
a tunne and made that his house.
Whan he had any graue matter, he
wolde call the people to heare him,
whiche whan they regarded not,
he wolde sing pleasantly: to which
whan many resorted, he wolde say:
to heare folyshnes ye runne a pace,
but to heare any wayghty matter
ye scarce put forth your fote. He wō
                  dered
at Grāmarians whiche could
shewe of other folkes lewdnes, and
neclected theyr owne. He reproued
Musitians, because they toke great
care that theyr instrumentes shulde
agre, &amp; theyr owne maners agreed
not. He rebuked the Mathematikes
whiche behelde the sonne, ye moone,
and the starres, and neclected the
busines that laye before theyr fete.

He taunted the orators because they
studyed to speake that was iust, &amp;
folowed not the same in theyr
lyuyng. He dispraysed the people,
whiche whyle they sacrificed, and
gaue thankes for theyr healthe,
wolde make great bankets, which
was agaynst theyr health: he wondred
that seruauntes coulde stand
and se men eat, and snatched not awaye
theyr meate. Beyng mocked
because he annoynted his fete with
odours, and not his head, he sayde:
the sauour goth from the head vp
into the ayer, but from the fete vp
to the nose. Being asked what tyme
a man shulde dyne, he sayde: a riche
man whan he wyll, and a pore man
whan he maye, when one had geuen
him a blowe vpon ye eare, he sayde:
I wyst well I had left somwhat
vncouered. To yonge laddes yt stode
about hym saying: we wyll beware

folish question, he gaue none answer,
beyng asked why he helde hys
peace, he sayde: Silence is the answer
of folish questions. Innumerable
suche pretie answers &amp; taūtes
he vsed, which who so listeth to here
shall fynde in the Apothegmes of
Erasmus, whiche is no lesse fynely
handled in the English than in the
latine, beside yt it is also more plaine
&amp; parfect. This Diogenes liued. 90.
yeres, &amp; died beyng byt of a dogge
some wryte, other saye that he styfled
hym selfe, with long holding of
his breathe: After whose death there
was great stryfe amonge his scholers,
who shulde haue his body to
bury, neuertheles the stryfe was
appeased by the elders, and they buryed
hym by the gate that leadeth
to Isthmus, and made hym a fayre
tumbe, and set a piller with a dogge
therupon, and set thereto a goodly

Epitaphie. His good preceptes, and
prouerbes shall followe in theyre
places.
            
            
               ¶Of Antisthenes. Cap. xxvi.
               
                  ANtisthenes the sonne
of Antisthenes, was
borne at Athens: And
was disciple to Gorgias
the oratour, of
whome he learned to
pleade: and from hym he went to
Socrates, of whome he learned
wysdome, and morall Philosophie.
To a yong man that wolde be hys
scholer, which asked what he neded
to hys learnyng, he answered: a
newe boke, and a newe wyt. Whan
it was tolde hym that Plato spake
euyll of hym, he sayde: It is kyngly
to be euell spoken of, whan a man
doth well. He wolde say that it were
better for a man in hys necessitie, to
fall amonge rauens, than amonge

flattereres: for rauens wyll eat none
but dead folke, but flatterers wyll
eat men being aliue. He wolde saye
yt Cities must nedes decaye, where
good mē were not knowen from the
bad. Beyng praysed of euell men, he
sayde: I feare me that I haue done
some euell. He wold saye that it was
a great ouersight, sithens they purged
theyr wheate from darnell, and
theyr warres of cowardly soldiers,
that they purged not theyr common
weale from enuyous people. Beyng
asked of a man what was best to
learne, he sayde: to vnlearne the euell
that thou hast learned. He alwayes
toke Plato for proude, disdaynous,
and hygh mynded: in somuche
that whan he met hym at a
tryumphe, wheras there were many
goodly and coragious neyghyng
horses, he sayde: o Plato thou woldest
haue made a goodly horse. He

wrote many goodly bokes &amp; spake
many proper and piththy sentences,
whiche shalbe spoken of hereafter.
He died of a disease whā he was very
olde. If is sayde that whan he
was sicke, Diogenes came to visit
hym, hauyng a blade by his syde, &amp;
whan he sayde, who shall rid me frō
my disease: Diogenes shewing him
his sweard, sayde: this same shal, to
whiche Antisthenes sayde, I spake
of my grefe, &amp; not of my lyfe. There
were mo of this name, but he lyeth
buryed at Athens.
            
            
               ¶Of Isocrates. Cap. xxvii.
               
                  ISocrates was a Grecian
borne, &amp; cam of a good kinred
&amp; was in his youth wel
brought vp in all kindes
of good maners, and whan he came
to age &amp; discretiō, he was an hearer
of Gorgias the oratour, whose disciple
he continued, vntyll suche time

as he was well learned, bothe in
naturall &amp; also in morall Philosophy.
As some saye he was in ye time
of Ahasuerus ye kyng, and was of
suche fame for his learning, namely
for morall Philosophy, that he semed
to many rather a god than a
man: He liued vertuouslye, wyth
suche faythfulnes in frendship, and
continence of his bodye, and with
suche piththines in his coūsayle, as
verye fewe hath ben like him since.
He wrot many goodly bokes in his
youthe, whiche he folowed in hys
age: of whiche his good coūsayles
to Demonicū, testyfye his wit &amp; his
learning in morall Philosophy, besyde
other which he wrote of naturall
Philosophy. He liued long time
for (as Ualerius Maximus saieth)
whā he was .xciiii. yeres olde, he set
forth ā excellent boke, ful of ye spirit.
In all his workes he praysed vertue

as hed foūtaine of all maner riches,
&amp; exhorted al mē thervnto. To
one that axed him yf he wolde be a
king? he answered that he woulde
not: And beyng asked wherfore: he
sayde: If I iudge rightfully, I can
not eschue ye hatred of many mē: &amp; agayne
yf I iudge wrongfully, I cā
not eschue ye payne of eternall dānaciō:
wherfore I had rather liue porely
assured of ye blisse of heauen, thā
in doubt therof, possessing all worldly
riches. Being asked how a man
might kept him selfe from anger? he
answered: In remembring yt god
loketh alwayes vpon him. In hys
tyme men delyted muche in blacke
heare, wherfore one of hys neyghbours
died his head blacke: &amp; whan
one asked him why his neybour did
so? he featly tauntyng his neyghbours
folyshnes, answered: because
no man shulde axe counsayle, nor
learne any wysedome of hym.
               
                  
What woulde he say nowe trowe
we, yf he sawe these wyues, yt not
onely coloure their heare, but also
paynt theyr faces? He vsed oftentymes
ī his prayers, to desyre god
to kepe &amp; saue him from the daunger
of his frendes, rather than frō
his enemies: and beyng demaunded
of one that hearde him, why he
prayed so, he sayde: as for myne
enemy I can beware of, for why I
trust him not: so can I not of my
frende, because I trust him. Beyng
asked what a mā ought not to do,
although it were iust and true, he
answered: to prayse hym selfe. He
liued .cii. yeares, and dyed for very
age, &amp; was buryed honorablye.
The rest of his
sayinges, shalbe
spoken of hereafter.

                  PLutarche ye Philosopher,
was a man of a
wondrefull wyt, well
brought vp in hys
youthe, well instructed
in maners, &amp; well furnyshed in
al kyndes of learnyng: which growing
vp as wel ī vertue, &amp; learnīg
as in body &amp; yeares, was chosen, &amp;
that worthely, to be the instructer
of ye Emperour Traiane, whome
he so well instructed, that his glorye
therby was greatly augmented,
as it is sayde in Policrato, the
fifth boke. He was faythfull in
his sayinges, and eloquent in hys
wordes, and very diligent &amp; ware
in his maners, of a chaste lyfe and
good conuersation. He gaue hys
mynde muche to instruct &amp; teache
other, and wrote manye bokes, of
whiche one intytled the education

of youthe, whyche we haue in the
English tonge, (drawne therinto
by the excellent &amp; famous knyght
Sir Thomas Eliote, whose good
zeale &amp; loue bothe to further good
learning, &amp; to profyt his countrey,
appeareth as well therby, as by other
many workes, which he hath
payned him selfe, to bryng īto our
lāguage) sheweth wel his good affectiō
yt he had to ye cōmō weale. He
wrote an other boke, called ye institution
of Traiane, In whiche he
setteth out the office of a Prince, &amp;
what he ought to be, so excellently,
as no mā can amēde it. He wrote al
so an other boke, entitled Archigrammatum,
wherin he teacheth
rulers &amp; officers howe to gouerne
them selues, wt diuers other thinges:
among whiche the letter that
he wrote to Traiane what tyme
he was created Emperour, is worthye
to be remembred, in the ende

wherof he sayth thus. Thou shalte
rule al thinges euen as thou woldest,
yf thou go not from thy selfe:
and yf thou dispose all thy workes
to vertue, all thinges shal prosper
wt the: And as touching ye gouernaūce
of thy cōmon weale, I haue
taught the therin already, whiche
yf yu shalte folowe me thy
master Plutarche, as an example
of good lyuyng: but yf yu do otherwyse,
thā shal this my lettre be my
wytnes, yt I gaue the neyther coū
                  cel

Whā he was aged, he dyed, &amp; was
buried honorably, his goodly prouerbes,

               ¶Of Seneca. Cap. xxix.
               
                  SEneca the Philosopher, an
excellent well learned mā,
was borne in Corduba,
and therof called Cordubences.

He was disciple to Stratus
the stoycke, and was Lucane
the Poetes countreyman. He floryshed
at Rome, in the tyme of the
Emperour &amp; Tyrant Nero, whom
he taught in his youth ī learnyng
and maners, whiche afterwardes
was cause of hys deathe. In the
tyme of this Seneca, Peter and
Paule came to Rome and preched
there. And whan many of Nero ye
Emperours house gathered togyther
to heare Paule, Seneca amonge
the test, was so familier wt
him, &amp; delighted so muche to heare
the diuine science, and wysdome,
whiche he sawe in him, yt it greued
him to be seperate at any tyme frō
his cōmunication: insomuche than
whan he might not talke with him
mouth to mouth, he vsed communicatiō
by letters oft sent betwene
them. He read also the wrytynges

and doctrines of Paule, before the
Emperour Nero, and got him the
loue and fauour of euery bodye:
Insomuch that ye Senate wondered
muche at Paule. This Seneca
was a man of a verye chaste
lyfe, &amp; so good, that sainct Iherom
numbreth hym in hys bederowe
of Sayntes, prouoked therto by
his Epistles, whiche are entytled
Seneca to Paule, &amp; Paule to Seneca.
After he lyued in to a meane
age, he was slayne of Nero the tyraunt,
two yeares before Peter &amp;
Paule suffered theyr gloryoꝰ martyrdome.
For Nero on a daye beholdyng
hym, &amp; callyng to mynde,
howe he whan he was his master,
dyd beat him, he conceyued hatred
agaynst hym, and beyng desyroꝰ
to reuenge hym selfe, and to put
hym to deathe, gaue hym lycence
to chose what kynde of deathe he

woulde, wherfore Seneca, seynge
that his tyranny coulde not be appeysed,
and supposyng that to dye
in a bayne, was ye easyest kynde of
deathe, desyred to be let bloode in
the vaynes of his armes, and so
dyed: which death as some thynke
was forshewed in his name Seneca,
that is to saye se necans, whiche
signifyeth in Englishe, a kyller of
him selfe. He wrote in his lyfe time
many goodly bokes, out of whiche
shalbe pyked some of ye most piththy
sentences, bothe of preceptes
and counsayles, and also of Prouerbes,
Adages, Parables and
Semblables, whyche in theyr
places hereafter shall folowe. And
because the lyues of these before
written are sufficient for our pourpose,
and because we be desyrous
to be as shorte as we myght be,
here wyll we finish the firste boke:

desyrynge all men that the same
shall rede, to folowe the good vertues
that therin are contayned.

                  A man may learne, as chaūce therto him dryues
                  To shape an answer. Or yf he be constrayned
                  To wrath or anger, or other passions lyke,
                  Here shal he see howe lyke lustes wer refrayned
                  Of Hethen men, who thought it shame to strike
                  Whē good occasiō oftymes thē therto payned.

boke intytled, of preceptes
and counsayles.
            
               ¶Of the profite of morall Philosophy.
Cap. i.
               
                  IT is not vnknowen
to any,
which haue any
knowlege at al,
how profitable,
necessary, &amp; nedefull
it is for mē,
to haue ye knowlege
of morall
Philosophy (In
whiche whoso
is ignorant, is
worse than a brute beast) and therfore it
mought here haue wel ben omytted. Yet
neuerthelesse to satisfye yt desires of some,
and to stop the mouthes of other some,
whiche peraduenture, wolde be glad (accordyng
to the prouerbe,) to seke a knot in
a rishe, and agayne to helpe and encourage
other, whom eyther ignoraunce or neglygence
holdeth backe: it semeth necessary,
though not all, yet at ye least to shewe some
of ye innumerable commodities, that there
vnto be ioyned. Wherin omittyng, the discommodities,

whiche for lacke therof daylye
augment &amp; growe, as malice, hatred,
enuy, pryde, lacke of loue, deceytes, robberies,
theftes, murthers, bluddy battayles,
seditions, decaye of cities, decaye of common
weales, spoyling of realines, and vtter
desolation of people and kyngdomes,
what can be a greater commoditie than for
euery man peaceably, to possesse his owne:
whiche peaceable agrement sith it can none
other wayes be got, nor when it is got be
preserued, but by loue, whych only springeth
of agremente in maners, and morall
vertues, what thyng ought men more to
embrace? Agayne yf we consyder the diuinitie
of our soules, whiche god hath created
to hys owne lykenes, and ye rewardes
therto due, for the maners whiche it hath
vsed in this lyfe, what wordly thing shall
be able to be compared therwith? Agayne
yf we consyder howe nedefull it is, as the
onely helpe that god hath geuen vs to supply
that whiche nature hath left vnperfect,
than shall we knowe what a Iuell it
is. For where as Nature bringeth forth all
other creatures able to helpe them selues,
clothing them and geuing them fode without
takyng any payne or labour therfore:
onely mā is borne naked, destitute of power
to helpe hym selfe, ye (as sayth Plinie)
not one borne to his owne vse, neyther is

any man able to lyue hym selfe alone. For
yf he had al the wul in the worlde, yet yf it
were not carded, spunne, dressed, &amp; brought
into clothe, it woulde not defend him from
the colde: Agayne yf he had al the grayne,
that spryngeth on the yearth, yet yf it wer
vngrounde, and vnbaked, it wolde be vnmete
meare: whiche sith they be diuers
mennes offices one man alone can not doe.
And sith therfore it is so, that no man can
lyue alone, but must of necessitie bothe
helpe and be holpen of other, what can be
better than good maners, that make euery
man glad &amp; wyllyng to do one for an other:
that ioyneth vs togyther in loue and
frendshyp, and helpeth vs in all kynde of
necessities? Surelye nothyng. Wherfore
who so willeth to be riche, lette him learne
maners, whiche teache how to get, &amp; to retayne
frendes, which are the verye riches.
Whoso desireth honor, let hym study vertuous
maners, whiche is the only thyng in
man worthy to be honored. Fynally what
soeuer any man woulde attayne, let hym
learne mortall wisedome, without whiche
no thing that is good maye be obteyned.
Whiche, that it myght the more esylyer be
learned (accordyng to our promise in the
fyrst booke) we purpose in thys folowyng
to set forth ye preceptes and counsayles, of
those Phylosophers, whose lyues we

shewed in our former booke: Iustantly desyryng
all men not onely to reade, but also
to folowe the same. And althoughe saynt
Paule haue byd you beware that no man
deceyue you with Philosophye, he ment
not morall, as many learned clarkes wrytyng
vpon the same, playnly do testyfye.
Which councell all mē to folowe it, namely
so muche, as agreeth with ye commaundementes
of god. Repugnant to the which
ye shall fynde litle in thys boke: and because
ye maye the better vnderstand what
the Philosophers haue thought of
god, here shalbe set to gyther suche

of hym and of his power, &amp;

whiche ryd of theyr bodye, shulde also

for the wycked to trust in.
                  
                     
The soule when it dyeth, caryeth nothyng

and hath of it selfe none other helpe:
wherfore all suche as for the multitude
of theyr sinnes and mischeues are hopeles,
and suche as haue commytted sacrilege,
slawghters, with other suche lyke
wickednesse, the iustice of god and theyr
owne desertes dampne vnto euerlastyng
death, from whiche they shal neuer be delyuered:
but suche as haue lyued more godlye
than other, beyng by deathe deliuered
from the pryson of the bodye, shall ascend
vp into a purer lyfe, and dwell in heauen
euerlastynglye.
                  The immortalitie of the soule excludeth
all hope from the wycked, and establisheth
the good in theyr goodnes.

                     THese are part of the preceptes
and counsayles of the heathen
men, which taken and vsed as
they shulde be, are not vnmete
for Christen men to followe.
Of whiche I coulde haue made a greater
boke, but for so muche as these fewe contayne
the effect of all, &amp; because also yt men
wyl be sone weary of tediouse matters, be
they neuer so good, it semed good for fear
of bryuyng men from it, before they sawe
it, to be as brefe as mought be: wysshyng
that these few myght be wel accepted. To
the whiche I haue set no summaryes, because
I woulde that they shoulde be read
thoroughlye. And although they be so easye,
playne, and common, that euery chyld
can saye the same, yet beyng so lytle followed
of men, whiche shoulde knowe them
best, I thought it no shame at all to wryte
them, which mynde not in this booke to
teache men to speake, but to do ye thynges
whiche they can speake alreadye.
                  Wherein peraduenture some wylle muse
why I haue attributed so many sentences
to Socrates, whiche they perhaps knowe
to haue be wrytten of other men: in which
doyng I folowed the prouerbe. Doubtefull
thynges ought to be interpreted to the
best. And therfore suche thinges as I haue

founde wrytten, without certaynty of any
certayne authour, I haue ascrybed vnto
hym, not onelye because they be thynges
meete for hym to speake, but because they
be wrytten by some of his scholers, which
learned them of hym. Among whome the
most excellent, setteth forth suche thinges
in hys maysters name, that the authoritie
of the speaker, myght cause the matter to
be more regarded. I meane Plato, whose
example in this poynt I haue folowed, yet
not so desyrous to perswade wyth
the authoritie of the speaker,
as wyth goodnes of the
thynge, whyche
he hath spoken.
                  The whiche wyth al
the rest, I would
wyssh al men
to learne,

                  hylosophers
rauyshed in the loue of wysdome,
haue not onely labored to knowe it to the

meanes, to prouoke and entice all men
to delyte in the same: and because they consydered
mennes myndes to be variable, &amp;
diuersly delytyng, they deuysed to set out
wysedome in sondry kyndes of wrytyng,
that euery man myght fynde wherin to delyte,
and so to be caught in his owne pleasure.
Among whiche kyndes of teaching
although preceptes and counsayles be the
most playne and easye, yet lacke they the
grace of delyte, whiche in theyr Prouerbes

they haue supplyed, and that so fynely
and so wyttely, that they bothe delyte and
perswade excedynglye, myxed with suche
piththynes in wordes &amp; sentence, as maye
minister occasion to muse &amp; studye, a cause
to fire them the better in memory: and like
a playster bothe corrosyue &amp; incarnatiue,
tanting vices, and shewing the remedyes:
beyng therwithall so brefe, that wythout
trouble they maye be contayned. As for an
example this lyttle prouerbe.
               Wrathe leadeth shame in a lease.
               What myght there be sayde to cause a mā
more to refayne his wrath? For euery man
naturally hateth shame, whiche sith it is
the folower and ende of anger, and therto
ioyned inseperablye, euen as the shadowe
foloweth the body, what man considering
the ende, wyl vse hym selfe therto. And to
make hym ashamed, loe here an other.
               He that to his wrath and anger is thrall,
Ouer his wyt hath no power at all.
               Nowe what maye make a man more ashamed
of hym selfe, than to be thought a very
foole? I suppose nothyng.
               Wherfore syth this kynde is so wytty,
and so pleasant, I haue endeuored in this

boke to gather togyther part of theyr prouerbes,
and haue sundred them into chapters,
that they myght the easylier be had
and founde out for al maner pourposes.
And suche thinges as I thought most proper,
I haue drawen into meter, and ioyned
with them diuers other, by other men
done alreadye, to the intent that suche as
delyte in Englyshe meter, and can retayne
it in memory better than prose, might find
herin somwhat according to theyr desires:
whiche booke and meters I submyt to the
correction of fyne wytted and wel learned
men, desyring them herein to pardon myne
ignoraunce, and to beare with my boldnes
whiche thought it better though rudely to
doe sumwhat, than to be ydle, and to do nothyng.
For by ydlenes, no goodnes maye
come: but al wyckednes hath growen ther
of accordyng to the prouerbe.
               Ydlenes is the cause of ignoraunce,
and Ignoraunce the cause of errour.
               Where as by this my labour, though simple
and rude, I maye chaunce to styrre vp
summe by occasion herein geuen, to hādle
the matter as I woulde I coulde my self.

cūme none euyll, wheras good may chaūce
therby dyuers wayes.
               
                  
Yet to Momus, and his scorneful mayny,
whiche I am sure wyl despyse this, before
they knowe it, as it is theyr custome in al
maner matters be they neuer so good, I
wyll obiect this saying of Horace.

whiche no man maye be safe.

                  That which kepeth a man from shame
is better than ryches gotten therby.

                  He is perfectly pacient whiche in hys

                  Socrat.
                  Pacience, and good belefe in god, maketh

                  Aristo.
                  It is not possyble for one man to know

                  An opinion without learnyng can not
be good.
                  He that erreth afore that he know the

                  Errour at the ende is knowen to be euyll▪
and truthe therby is knowen muche

                  It is great shame for an olde man to be
ignoraunt.
                  There can not be in a Ruler, a worser

                  He that is ignoraunt in the truthe, and
led about with opinions, must nedes erre.
                  To learne better, is a good punyshment
for ignoraunce.
               
               
                  Socrat.
                  There is none so ignoraunt, as he that
trusteth most to his owne wyt: none so vncertayne,
as he that most trusteth fortune,
nor any so muche oute of quyet, as he yt is
cumbred with an vnruly brawling shrew.
                  Through lacke of wyt, sprīgeth much

good is left vndone.
                  A false opinion doeth great harme.

Loue is a

                  Without
Loue,
no vertue
can be perfect.
                  There
are twoe
kyndes of
loue: the
one Naturall, and the other Heauenlye.
                  The good louer loueth his soule better
than his bodye.
                  The euyl louer loueth his body, and not
his soule.

                  This loue of a foole, is more noysome
than pleasaunt.
                  Loue can not be myngled with feare.
Loue is the busynes of loyterers.
               
               
                  Seneca.
                  He that lacketh loue, oughte not to be

                  Repentaunce is the ende of fylthy loue.
                  There is nothynge so darcke, but that
loue espyeth.
                  Loue leaueth no daūger vnattempted.

                  To muche selfe loue is cause of al euyl.
Luste is a lordlye and disobedient thyng,
                  Of all thynges the newest is the

                  Seneca.
                  Lykenes of maners, maketh loue stedfast
and parfecte.
                  It is not possible to do any thyng well
without loue.
                  It is not possible for that seruaunt to
be diligent, that loueth not his mayster.

                  Sorowe is a gryfe for thynges that be

                  Fear is a doubt for thinges for to come.
Feare of hym selfe accuseth the gyltye.

                  Seneca.
                  Shamefastnes in a chylde, is a token
of wyt, but in a man of folyshnes.
                  Suretye putteth awaye sorrowe, and
feare hyndereth gladnes.

lyfe semeth a thyng of no reputacion.

                  He that neglecteth wyfe and chyldren
depryueth hym selfe of immortalitie.

                  Nobilitie, glory, and rychesse, are the
clokes of maliciousnes.
                  He that is myghtye, is not by and by

and not by vyolence.
                  It is lawful to be a frende, but no farther
than to the aulter: that is, we ought
not for our frendes sake to trāsgresse our
religion.

                     BEnefits ought
to be as well
borne in mynde
as receyued wt

of benefyttes
ought
neuer to ware

                  The wyll of
the geuer, and not the value of the gyfte,
is to be regarded.
                  He is worthye to be deceyued whyche
whyle he bestowed a benefit, thought of ye
receyuyng of an other.
                  A small thynge geuen wyllynglye, is
more acceptable than that which is grudgyngly
geuen, be it of neuer so great pryce
                  One gyfte wel geuen, recouereth many
losses.
                  A gyft grudgyngly geuen of a nygard,
is called a stony loafe: whiche although it
be bytter, is nedeful to be receyued of the
hongrye.
                  He is vnthankfull whiche acknowlegeth
not the good that is done hym. He is
more vnthankful that to his power acquiteth

it not. But he is most vnthākfull that
forgetteth it vtterly.

                  To be vnthankful is an vncomly thing.
                  There is no greater treasure, than discrecion

                  No greater pouertie than ignoraunce.

of disprayse.
                  It is better to heare than to speake much.
and therefore Nature hath geuen vs two
eares, and but one tongue.
                  Experience is a good chastisement.
                  It is better to seeke and not to fynde,

consydered, is no
lesse profytable, ether
to good instrustruction,
or moral
wisedome, than any
of the rest. For where as the other only
commaunde or shewe the thing simply,
this kynde by vehemencie of matter contayned
in other thynges, perswadeth the
thyng effectuallye, besydes muche good
learnyng of naturall Philosophie, conteyned
in the examples.
            And suerlye the diligence of the Philosophers
herein is greatly to be commended,
whiche hath diuised so goodly a waye to
allure all men to wysedome.
            
               
In whiche kynde, sithe Erasmus, one
of the best learned in oure tyme, hath alredy
studyed, and therof compyled a boke
drawen (as he sayeth hym selfe) out from
the purest of the Philosophers, I haue
herein englysshed of his, suche as to me
semed moste meete for this pourpose, addyng
them to other agreable to this matter:
omyttyng the rest, not because they
agree not her with, but because they be so
many, as wyll in englyshe make a great
volume: wyllyng suche as therin delyte,
to set forth the rest, and not to loke for al
thynges here, in whiche nothyng lesse thā
perfection is pretended.
            As for the profyt and vse of Parables
I thynke it nedeles for to declare, seyng
theyr owne playnnesse declare theym so
playnly, as no man maye do it playnlyer:
as for example.
            Lyke as Humlocke is poyson to man,
so is wyne poyson to Humlocke.
What declaracion neadeth this nowe, to
be better vnderstanded, except a man phisicallye
shoulde shewe the properties of
wyne and Humlockes? Nowe as for the
vse of this in perswasion, it may be thus
applyed.
            Lyke as Humlocke is poyson to man,
and wyne poyson to Humlocke: So is
Flattery poyson to frendship, and licence

in be flattered, poyson vnto flattery.
            Loe here the exaumple that Erasmus
vseth, wherin is contayned great councel
great wyt, and great learnyng. Fyrste it
teacheth that Humlocke is poyson, &amp; mortall
whan it is myngled with wyne, whiche
beyng knowen, maye the better be auoyded.
Then coūsayleth he to beware of
flatterye, and in shewyng what maketh
flattery deadly poyson, he teacheth a remedy
howe to auoyde flattery: For yf we
regard not a flatterer, nor geue hym licēce
to flatter vs, we shall neuer be hurte vp
flatterye. Suche lyke commoditie shall a
man take by Parables, or as I call them,
Semblables, which hereafter shal folow:
the effect whereof, I haue not drawen into
Summaries because they be so fewe,
but haue put them togyther, as I
founde them, wysshyng them
with all the rest, to be

               As plantes measurably watered grow

so the mynde that is ruled by perfect reason,

               As a small spotte or freckle in the face

               As fyer smoketh not muche, that flameth

kaye or stryng of his instrument out of
tune, doeth not immediatlye cut it of, and
cast it awaye, but eyther with straynyng

by lyttle and lyttle, causeth it to agree: so
shoulde rulers rather refourme trāsgressours,
than to cast them awaye for euerye
trespasse.
               Lyke as narrowe mowthed vesselles
whiche are longest in fyllyng, kepe theyr

candle negligently lefte in an house maye
sette an whole towne on fyer: so of priuye
malice and discorde, cōmeth open destruction

the wearyng: so the wyt is the most ready
that is most occupyed.
               Lyke as they that taste poyson, destroy
them selues therwith: so he that admytteth
a frende before he knowe hym, maye
hurte hym selfe whyles that he proueth
hym.
               Lyke as a Chamell hath all coulours
saue whyte: so hath a flatterer al poyntes
saue honestie.
               Lyke as one braunche of a tree beynge
set on fyre, kyndeleth al the rest: so one vicious
felow, destroyeth an hole company.
               As a precious stone in a golden Kyng,
so shyneth an heart that is settled in vertuousnesse.
               Lyke as with water, Maulte is made
sweete: euen so a sorowful heart is made
mery with wyne.
               As a sycke man is cured of his disease
by vertue of a medicine: so is an yll man
healed of his malice, by vertue of ye lawe.
               Lyke as men chose good grounde to labour
and to sowe: so shulde they chose honest
men to be theyr seruauntes.
               
                  
As the fortune of this worlde shall make
the reioyce ouer thyne enemyes: euen so
maye it make thyne enemyes reioyce ouer

               Lyke as waxe is ready and plyaunt to
receyue any print or fygure: so is a young
chylde apte to any kynde of learnyng.
               As a Phisicion can not cure his pacyent,
excepte he knowe fyrste the truthe of

good counsayle, except he knowe throwly
the effect of the matter.
               Euen as a good Gardyner is very diligent
about his gardeyn, waterynge the
good and profitable herbes, and rootynge
out the vnprofytable weedes: so shoulde
a kyng attende to his common weale, cheryshyng
his good and true subiectes, and
punyshyng suche as are false, and vnprofitable.
               As the cuttyng of vynes and all other
trees, is cause of better and more plentyfull
fruyte: so the punyshment of the bad
causeth the good to florysh.
               Lyke as grene wood whiche is long in
kyndelyng, is whotter than the dry whan
it is fyered: so he that is seelde and longe
ere he be angrye, is harder to be pacifyed,
than he that is sone vexed.
               Lyke as the bytternes of the Allowe
tree, taketh away the swetnes of the swetest

honnye: so euyll workes destroye and
take awaye the merite of the good.
               Lyke as an arrowe that lyghteth on a
stone glaunceth awaye, bycause the stone
lackyng softnes, yeldeth not to receyue it:
so the ryches that fortune geueth, not gyded
with diligence, &amp; circumspection, vanysh
awaye without profyt.
               He that teacheth good to an other, and
followeth it not hym selfe: is lyke hym
whiche lyghteth a candle to another, and
goeth hym selfe darklyng.
               Lyke as a vessell is knowen by ye soūde
whether it be whole or broken: so are men
proued by theyr speche, whether they be
wyse or foolysh.
               Lyke as a flye whiche feedeth vpon corrupte
thynges, despyseth the sweete, and
pure herbes: so wyckednes foloweth the
wycked, dispraysing all goodnes.
               As rust consumeth yron: so doeth enuy
the heartes of the enuyous.
               As a shepeherde amonge his shepe: so
ought a kyng to be among his subiectes.
               Lyke as a fyelde although it be fretile
can bryng forth no good frute, except it be
fyrste tylled: so the mynde although it be
apte of it selfe, can not without learnyng
brynge forth any goodnes.
               As the plowgh rooteth oute from the
yearthe, all brambles and thystles: euen

so wysedome rooteth oute all vyces from
the mynde.
               Lyke as a crased shyp by drynkyng in
water, not onely droundeth it self, but all
other that are in her: so a Ruler by vsyng
viciousnes, destroyeth not hym self alone
but al other besydes that are vnder his gouernaunce.
               As it becommeth the people to be obedyent
and subiect to theyr lorde and king:
so it behoueth the kyng to entend diligently
to the weale &amp; gouernaunce of his people,
and rather procure theyr profyt, than
his owne pleasure. For as the soule is ioyned
with the bodye: so is a Kyng vnited
with his people.
               Lyke as a small disease, excepte it be
loked to in tyme, and remedyed, maye be
the destruction of the whole bodye: so yf
Rulers be negligent, and loke not to smal
thynges whervpon greater do depende, &amp;
se them reformed in tyme, they shal suffre
the common weale to decaye, not able to
refourme it, whan that they woulde.
               As the shadowe foloweth the body: so
prayse foloweth vertue. And as the shaddowe
goeth sumtymes before, and sumtymes
behynde, so dothe prayse also to vertue,
but the later that it commeth, the greater
it is, and the more of valure.
               
                  
As in euery Pomegranade there is some
grayne rotten: so is there no man but hath
some euyll condicion.
               As a man appeareth more in a mist, thā
in cleare weather: so appeareth his vyce
more whan he is angrye, than whan he is
at quyet.
               As no Phisicion is reputed good that
healeth other, and can not heale hym self:
so is he no good gouernour that cōmaundeth
other to auoyde vices, and wyll not
leaue them hym selfe.
               Lyke as the fyre wasteth ye fyerbrand:
so dothe scornfulnes waste loue betwene
frendes.
               As men for theyr bodely health, do abstayne
from euyll meates: so oughte they
to abstayne from sinne, for the saluacion
of theyr soules.
               As healthe conserueth the body: euen
so wysedome conserueth the soule.
               As a Capitayne is the directer of an
hole hoste: so Reason ioyned with knowledge,
is the gyde of lyfe.
               Lyke as an hande is no parte of a man
except it can do the office of an hande: so is
wysedome no part of a wyseman, excepte
it be occupyed as it shulde be.
               Lyke as a gouernour of a shyp, is not
chosen for his rychesse, but for hys knowledge:
so ought Rulers of Cities to be chosen

for theyr wysedome and learnyng, rather
than for theyr dignitie and rychesse.
               As a golden brydle▪ although it garnysh
an horse, yet maketh hym neuer the
better: so although riches garnish a man,
yet can they not make hym good.
               Lyke as age followeth youthe: euen
so death followeth age.
               As to the good, theyr goodnesse is a rewarde:
so to the wycked, theyr wyckednes
is a punyshment.
               Lyke as gryefe is the disease of the
bodye: so is malyce a syckenesse of the
soule.
               As a man in a darke caue maye not see
his owne proper fygure: so the soule that
is not cleane &amp; pure, can not perceyue the
true and parfecte goodnes of almyghtye
God.
               As the goodnes of wysemen continuallye
amendeth: so the malice of fooles euermore
empayreth.
               As God surmounteth all other creatures:
so the remembraunce of hym, surmounteth
all other ymaginacions.
               As liberalitie maketh frendes of enemyes:
so pryde maketh ennemyes of
frendes.
               Lyke as Beas oute of flowers, sucke
forth the swetest: so shulde men out of sciences,
learne that is best.
               
                  
Lyke as no man can tell where a shooe
wryngeth, saue he that weareth it: so no
man can knowe a womans disposition,
saue he that hath wedded her.
               As they whiche can not suffre the light
of a candle, can muche worse abyde the
bryghtnes of the Sunne: so they that are
trowbled with small tryfles, woulde be
more amased in wayghtyer matters.
               The spouse whiche forsaketh her husbande,
because she is greued with his maners:
is lyke hym, whiche because a 
                     •
                  ea
hath stonge hym, forsaketh the honye.
               He that fysheth with poyson, catcheth
fyssh, but yll &amp; corrupted: and so they that
endeuour to get theyr husbandes by decey
                  
                     •
                  es
and charmes, maye lyghtly get them,
but better vngotten.
               Suche wyues as had rather haue foolysh
husbandes whome they myght rule,
than to be ruled by sobre wyse men: are
lyke to hym whiche woulde rather leade
a blynde man in an vnknowen way, than
to followe one that can see, and knoweth
the waye well.
               Lyke as a blocke though it be decked
with golde, pearles and gemmes, is not to
be regarded except it represent the shape
of sumwhat: euen so a wyfe be she neuer
so ryche, yet yf she be not obedient to her
husbande, she is nothyng worthe.
               
                  
Lyke as the sauour of carrayne is noysome
to them that smel it: so is the talke
of fooles to wysemen that heare it.
               Lyke as in a payre of tables, nothyng
maye be well wrytten, before the blottes
and blurres be wyped out: so vertue and
noblenes can not be sene in a man, excepte
he fyrst put awaye his vices.
               Lyke as the eye can not atones se both
aboue and benethe: no more maye the wyt
apply bothe vice and vertue together.
               As Yuye in euerye place fyndeth sumwhat
to cleaue to, so loue is neuer lyghtly
without a subiecte.
            
            
               ¶Aristotle, Plutarche, Seneca.
               
                  LYke as Nources oftentymes
whyle they be to curyous
to rubbe of spottes
from theyr chyldren, rub
awaye the skynne and al:
Euen so dyuers, whyles
they go aboute to redresse
small tryfles, commyt greater offences.
               He that casteth awaye his kynsfolke,
and maketh hym frendes of straungers:
doethe as the man whiche woulde cast awaye
his flesshy legge, and set on another
of wood.
               
                  
Lyke as rayne maye not profytte the

                     •
                  orne, that is sowen vpon drye stones: so
neyther teachyng nor studye maye profyt
a foole to learne wysedome.
               Lyke as the eye without lyght, can neyther
see it selfe, nor iudge of anye thyng
elles: so the soule that lacketh wisdome,
is brute and knoweth nothyng.
               As the townes wherein men laboure,
waxe alwayes rycher and rycher, &amp; suche
as are bent to ydlenes and pleasure, dayly
decaye, and come to vtter desolacion: so
the gooddes that be got by trauayle, study
and diligence, and so kepte, shall continue
and encreace, but that whiche is euyl got,
or sodaynly wonne, shall euen as sodaynly
vanysh awaye agayne.
               Lyke as the sycke man whiche asketh
counsayle, and is taught of the phisicion
is neuer the nerer of hys health, except he
take his medicine: so he that is instructe
in wysedome and vertue, &amp; followeth not
the same, is neuer the better therfore: but
loseth the healthe of his bodye, and blessednes
of his soule.
               Lyke as it is a shame for a man whiche
woulde hy
                     •
                   the prycke, to mysse the whole

                  utte: euen so is it a shame for hym that
desyreth honor, to fayle of honestye.
               As fyrr and heate are inseparable: so
are the har

                  es of faythful frendes.
               
                  
Lyke as a trumpeter soundeth out hys
meanyng by the voyce of his trumpet: so
shulde a woman let her housbaude speake
for her.
               They whiche were wount to do sacryfyce
vnto Iuno, the Boddesse of maryed
women, toke alwayes the galles out frō
the beastes whiche they sacrificed: signifiyng
therby, that al anger and displesure
ought to be farre from marryed folke.
               Lyke as they whiche kepe Eliphantes
weare no lyghte coloured garmentes, nor
they whiche kepe wylde bulles, weare no
purple, because suche colours dooe make
them fyerce: so ought a wyfe to abstayne
from suche thynges as she knoweth wyll
offende her husbande.
               Lyke as a membre vexed with the itche
hath alwayes nede of clawyng: so the couetousnes
of the mynde, can neuer be satisfyed.
               As a scarre geueth vs warnyng to beware
of woūdes: so the remembraunce of
euyls that are past, maye cause vs take the
better heede.
               As the complayntes of chyldren maye
be sone appeysed: so small affections vanysh
lyghtly.
               He that bryngeth an infirmed body to
a bayne, or to any voluptuousnes: is lyke
to hym whiche bryngeth a broken shyp in

to the ragyng seas.
               He whiche geueth ryches or glory to a
wycked man: geueth wyne to hym yt hath
a fyeuer.
               They whiche go to a banket onelye for
the meates sake: are lyke them whiche go
onely to fyll a vessell.
               Lyke as the bodye is an instrument of
the soule: so is the soule an instrument of
God.
               Seruauntes whan they sleape, feare
not theyr maysters, and they yt be bounde
forget theyr letters, in sleape vlcers and
sores leaue smartyng: but supersticion alone
vexeth a man whan he sleapeth.
               If they be miserable whiche haue cruell
maysters although they maye go from
them: howe muche are they more miserable
that serue their vices as their masters
from whome they can not flye.
               They whiche woorshyp God for feare
least any euyl shoulde chaunce vnto them:
are lyke them whiche hate Tyrantes, and
yet reuerence them because they shoulde
not hurt them.
               Lyke as they iudge worse of a man the
whiche saye that he is wrathfull and vngracious,
than yf they denyed hym to be
alyue: so they thynke not so euyl of god,
which saye there is no god at all, as the supersticious
whiche saye God is frowarde

and ful of wrathe and reuengeaunce:
               Luke as they whiche bryng vp horses
well, teache them fyrst to folowe the brydle:
so they that teache chyldren, shoulde
fyrst teache them to geue eare to yt whiche
is spoken.
               As we beholde our selues in other folkes
eyes: so shoulde we learne by other
mēnes reporte what doeth become vs and
what doeth not.
               Lyke as they whiche geue vnwyllinglye,
seeme to haue but lyttle them selues:
euen so they whiche prayse other folkes
sclenderlye, seeme to desyre to be praysed
them selues.
               Lyke as in meates, the holsomnesse is
as muche to be requyred as the pleasauntnesse:
so in hearyng and reading authors,
we ought to desyre as wel the goodnes as
the eloquence.
               As a lookyng glasse representeth euery
thing that is set agaynst it: euen so doeth
a flatterer.
               Lyke as the shadowe foloweth a man
continually, what so euer he doe: euen so
a flatterer what so euer a man doeth, applyeth
hym selfe to the same.
               Lyke as a Phisicion cureth a man secretlye,
he not fealyng it: so shulde a good
frende helpe his frende preuely, whan he
knoweth not of it.
               
                  
Lyke as the rule ought to be strayght and
iust, by which other rules shulde be tryed:
so ought a Gouernour whiche shoulde gouerne
other, to be good, vertuous, honest
and iust hym selfe.
               As a vessel can not be knowen whether
it be whole or broken except it haue licour
in it: so can no man be thorowlye knowen
what he is, before he be in authoritie.
               As darnell spryngeth vp among good

Enuye groweth vp among vertues.
               Where as is no lyght, there is no shadowe:
and where as is no welthe, there is
no Enuye.
               They that are ready to take a tale out
of an others mouthe, are lyke vnto them
whiche seynge one profered to be kyssed,
woulde houlde forth theyr lyppes to take
it from hym.
               Lyke as an hare bothe delyuereth, norysheth,
and is with younge all atones: so
an vsurer before he haue begyled one, deuyseth
howe to deceyue an other, by makyng
a false bargayne.
               Lyke as an horse after he hath ones taken
the brydle, muste euer after beare one
or other: so he that is ones fallen in det,
can lyghtly neuer after be throughly quit
ther from.
               As a wyse maryner in calme weather

prepareth hym selfe lokyng for a tempest:
Euen so ought the mynde when it is most
at quyet, to doubte of some tribulacion.
               Lyke as the famyshed for lacke of other
meate, are fayne some tyme to eate theyr
owne flesshe: so many that are vayngloryous,
are forced to prayse them selues because
no man elles wyll.
               Lyke as a spot ought to be wyped oute
at the fyrste, least with to long tarying, it
stayne through, and be the worse to be got
out: so shulde discention be remedyed at
the fyrst, that it growe not to hatred.
               As the vessell can not be full which alwaye
shedeth out, and taketh in nothing:
so the man can not be wyse, that euermore
talketh, and neuer harkeneth.
               Lyke as there is no tree but wyl waxe
barrayne and growe out of fashion if it be
not well attended: so is there no wyt so
good, but wyl waxe euyl, if it be not well
applyed.
               Lyke as there is no beast so wylde, but
that diligence maye make tame: so there
is no wyt so vnrulye, but that good bryngyng
vp maye maye make gentle.
               Lyke as Phisicions with theyr bytter
drugges, do myngle theyr sweete spyces,
that they myght be the better receyued: so
ought checkes to be myngled with gentle
admonicions.
               
                  
Lyke as a dogge deuowreth by and by
what so euer he maye catche, and gapeth
continuallye for more: so yf it chaunce vs
to obtayne any thyng, we set lytle by it, desyrous
alwayes to obtayne more.
               Lyke as the bookes which are seldome
tymes occupyed, wyl cleaue fast togither:
euen so the memory waxeth harde, yf it be
not oftentymes renued.
               Lyke as the stroke whiche a man seeth
maye be the better receyued and defēded:
so the mischyefe whiche is knowen of before
can do the lesse harme.
               The poyson whiche serpentes continually

contrary wyse hurte no man so muche

               Lyke as whan the wyne spourgeth, it
breaketh the vessell, and that whiche is in
the bottom cummeth vp to the brymme:
euen so drunkennes discouereth the secretes
of the heart.
               Lyke as a cunnyng woorkman can fashyon
an ymage of any kynde of matter:
so a wyseman shulde take in good worthe
all kyndes of Fortune.
               Lyke as the Sunne is alone bothe to
poore and ryche: so ought a Prynce not to
haue respect to the person, but to ye matter.
               Lyke as an Adamaut by a secret, &amp; hyd

power draweth Iron vnto it: euen so wisdome
by a secrete meane, draweth vnto it
the heartes of men.
               Lyke as fyre is an instrument without
whiche fewe workes can be fynyshed: so
with out Charitie, nothyng maye be done
well and honestly.
               Lyke as cleare glasse can hyde nothing:
so there be many that can kepe secret nor
dissemble nothyng.
               As some poysons are so contrarye by
Nature, that the one cureth the other: so
is it lykewyse of deceytes and vices.
               After wynter the sprynge tyme followeth:
but after age youthe neuer cōmeth
agayne.
               As it is a great foolyshnes to leaue the
cleare fountaynes and to fetche water in
puddles: so is it lykewyse to leaue the Euangelyes,
and to studye the dreames of
mennes ymagination.
               Lyke as an Adamant draweth by lytle
and lytle the heauy yron, vntyll at the last
it be ioyned with it: so vertue and wyse-ioyne
men vnto them.
               As he whiche in a game place, runneth
swyftest, and continueth styll his pace, obtayneth
the crowne for his labour: so all
that diligently learne, and earnestlye followe
wisedome &amp; vertue, shalbe crowned
with euerlastyng glorye.
