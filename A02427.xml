            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            Another godly Letter, lately written to the ſame H H by his owne Siſter
out of the Countrey, about eighty miles from London.
            GOod brother: I bleſſe God that yet I ſee your hand writing: by which his mercy appeareth,
in ſparing you and yours, among Thowſands that fall on your right hand and
on your left, in this heauie viſitation of Gods diſpleaſure: which goodnes of his in yet
ſparing you; my hope is you eſteeme according to the worth thereof, and make that holy
uſe of the ſame which God expects, and his Miniſters every where with earneſtneſſe call
vpon vs all for: namely, to ſearch and try our hearts and waies, and to turne from all our
ſins of heart and life, and to renew our vowes of better obedience for time to come. The
further meditations of theſe moſt neceſſarie things, I commend to your moſt ſerious
thoughts, as things moſt precious and requiſite for theſe times: in which moſt weighty
buſineſſe, I as your vnfained louing ſiſter ſhall, as I am able, continually pray God to aſſiſt
you, and in the performance of that which may in this kind bee acceptable in his ſight,
in Ieſus Chriſt: As alſo that hee would, as it may ſtand with his Glory, ſpare you
in this common Viſitation: However, to ſanctifie it, both in the feare of it, or inflicting of
it: ſo as euery way his fauour may be diſcerned, to the peace and comfort of your ſoule: To
which end, the All-ſufficient protection of the Almightie in mercy and goodneſſe be euer
vouchſafed vnto you and all yours: And let my ſiſter, your wife, know in particular that
in all good wiſhes I remember her equall with your ſelfe; and muſt to you both reſt a great
debtor for much loue.
            For vs here (in the Country, where I now am) I praiſe God we are all in bodily health:
my ſelfe and company that parted from you, came hither ſafe on Saturday at three of the
clock in the morning; hauing ridden all night, in regard that we could not bee lodged at
D. where we thought to haue lyen: of which you may heare more hereafter: But beſides
our ſelues we had very good company, which made our nights trauell very pleaſant to vs.
Brother, my brothers and ſiſters here doe all wiſh you well, and pray for you and yours; eſpecially
our deare mother, who wiſheth it could bee any wayes conuenient that you and
yours, I meane your wife, were here: though indeed my fathers houſe is already very full;
howeuer, you want not our aged Parents prayers and bleſſing, which they ſend you, and
their loue to your wife; and our good mother beſeecheth you both with teares to
loue and cheriſh each other in the Lord, that whatſoeuer hand of his may befall you:
yet it may bee ſweetned by your mutuall vndergoing it with patience and comfort:
and ſo once more I beſeech the Lord to ſtabliſh your hearts in his feare: And
with you to bee good to your afflicted Citie, and purge it by this Viſitation: and prepare
vs here in C. for the like: for it is to bee feared wee may not long ſcape: Wee had here
on Wedneſday laſt the Faſt kept publikely as in London: and before, I did pertake with M.
F. in what he did priuately for preparation to the publike Exerciſes. Good brother, commend
mee to all your neighbours and friends that I know, which you thinke will accept
the ſame from mee: by name M. D. and his wife, M. L. and his, &amp;c. Thus haue I ſeamblingly
imparted vnto you, in haſt, my mind, and how things are with vs here: Accept all
in good will, and whiles we liue let vs loue; that come life or death we may bee ſo linked
that death may not ſeparate vs: And whiles God ſpares you, let me I pray ſee your hand to
my ſelfe; which be aſſured I will take kindly: commend mee to little S. for whoſe mothers
death, and that further Viſitation I am not vnſenſible, in regard of my ſiſter your wife: but
ſhe is diſcreet; whom with your ſelfe once againe I commit to Gods mercy. Iuly 22. 1625.

Your true louing Siſter,
A. H.
