            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            To a true sauorer of forward spirits, Maister Iohn Florio.
            
               SIR, as distressed Sostratus spake to more fortunate Areius, to make him his mediator to Augustus The learned loue the learned, if they be rightly learned: So this your poore friend though he haue found much of you, yet doth still follow you for as much more: that as his Mecaenas you would write to Augustus, Bee as mindefull of Horace, as you would bee of my selfe: For his

apprentises essay you procured (GOD thanke you) an impregnable protection: He now prayes the same Patron (most worthy of all praise) for his iourney-mans Maister-peece: yet as Horace to Vinnius for his verses to Augustus, Ne studio nostri pecces.—And though the land bee the Lords wherein hee most laboured; yet see a handfull of fruites is falne to your share, who first shewed his workmanship. This Manuall of Epictetus, though not Saint Augustines Enchiridion, now by hap is the hand, or rather the hand-maide of a greater body of Saint

Augustines: and hath beene held by some the hand to Phylosophy, the instrument of instruments: as Nature, greatest in the least: as Homers Ilias in a nutshell: in lesse compasse more cunning: In all languages, ages, by all persons high prized, imbraced, yea imbosomed. It filles not the hand with leaues, but files ye head with leslons: nor would bee held in hand, but had by hart to boote. He is more senceles then a stocke, that hath no good sence of this Stoick. For the translation and translator, to whome better recourse, then one so trauail'd

in translation; both patterne and patron of translators. Artificers best iudge of arts. Wise they must bee that iudge the wise. But a short booke would haue no long Epistle, more then a small Towne a great gate. Wherfore as hee desired, I haue done: Who rest,
            
               
                  Yours in true harted loue.

            The life of EPICTETVS.
            
               EPICTETVS vvas a Philosopher of the sect of the Stoikes, borne in Hierapolis (now called Haleppo, situate in Phrygia, not farre from Laodicea): His estate was seruile; according to the testimony of AVLVS GELLIVS in his Noctes Atticae. For at Rome he was slaue vnto one EPAPHRODITVS, one of NERO's familiars. His life was spotlesse and vntaintable, his spirit wholy secluded that arrogancie of carriage which

otherwise stuck as a great blemish in the liues of the most and best Philosophers. For his esteeme, it had that high place in the worlds affection, that his very lamp
                  •
                (beeing but of Potters claye) was bought and solde for fifty pounds sterling. Of this EPICTETVS, you shall finde honorable mention made in LVCIAN, who otherwise was a perpetuall detractor from all the Philosophers, and in generall, a professed scorner of Gods and men. And in that place where he mentions him, hee toucheth also at this sale of his lampe, (for thus he writeth in his Dialogue; 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               
               
that is, to the vnlearned engrosser of books:) Our times (saith he) hath brought forth a man, and I thinke hee is yet aliue, that gaue fifty pound for EPICTETVS his earthen Lampe, thinking (be-like) that if hee had but light to study by from thence, that then hee should haue all EPICTETVS his wisdome inspired into him in dreames, and so become parallell to that admired father. Thus writeth LVCIAN. EPICTETVS was wont to affirme, that the scope and extent of all Philosophy was included in these two vvords: 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , Beare and Forbeare. In the reigne of

               DOMITIAN, either his owne dislike of his tyrannicall gouernment, or the Senates edict for the expulsion of all the Philosophers out of Rome, made him depart to Hierapolis, his natiue soyle, whence afterwards hee is sayd to returne, and so to make his aboade in Rome vntill the reigne of MARCVS ANTONIVS, about which time hee dyed.
         
         
            
            EPICTETVS his Manuall.
            
               CHAPTER. 1.
               
                  IN the order of the worlds existence, there are some things naturally subiected vnto our command, and some that exceed it. Of the first sort, is Opinion, affect, desire, dislike, &amp; in a word, all actions, whose performance is peculiarly resident in our selues: Of the latter sort, is the body, riches, glory, souerainty, and to conclude, althings

whose perfections depend not on our selues, but ab externo.
               
            
            
               CHAP. 2.
               The things that are swayed by our humaine wills, are in their owne nature free, and surmounters of all lettes and impediments what-soeuer. But the other from whose managing we are naturally secluded, are exposed vnto all infirmity, slauery, and hindrance, and indeed, direct aliens from our proper goods.
            
            
               CHAP. 3.
               
                  Wherefore take this generall memento, if thou repute those thinges that are naturally seruile, to bee really free, and confound thy proper goods with mixture of those externall ones, thou shalt neuer want woe, but bee driuen by sorrowe and perturbation to giue termes of offence both to God and Man. But if thou prize nothing for thine own but that which is essentially so, and hold all those externall goods, as they are, truly aliens from thy state, thou shalt bee seated aboue the power of all iniury or compulsion: thou shalt haue no

accusation to lay against any man, nor any act which thy will shall not prompt thee to perform: thou shalt stand beyond the reach of hurt, and without the feare of foes. Briefly, thou shalt not tast of the least calamity.
            
            
               CHAP. 4.
               If thine affections therefore stand for these happy obiects, be sure that thou pursue them with a more then meane alacrity, resoluing to omitte some thinges for euer, and othersome but for the present. Mary if thy desires beare a like leuell both

vnto these, and likewise vnto ritches, honours and soueraignties; thou maist perhaps come short of the attainment euen of those later, because thou standest so affected vnto the former: but, how-soeuer, thou shalt bee sure to loose the first, which are the only steps and guides vnto all freedome and felicity.
            
            
               CHAP. 5.
               Wherfore when thou seest any distastfull occurrence, let it be thy first care to perswade thy self thus: rush this is but a phantasie, and is not

as it seemes. And afterwards when thou commest to examine it more exactly, follow the rules thou hast prescribed vnto thee; and this especially: Whether this occurrence concerne the things that lye vnder mans managing or no? if it do not, then the case is plaine, it is wholy impertinent to thee.
            
            
               CHAP. 6.
               Remember well that the ayme of appetite, is to attaine what it affecteth, and the maine of dislike is to auoyde what it disliketh. So that to bee frustrated of

what wee desire, and to incurre what wee would auoide, are both vnfortunate euents. If therefore thy desires stand at the staues end, onely with those things that are vndoubtedly opposit vnto those which are at thine owne dispose, thou shalt neuer meete with any motion of dislike, but if thou stand at defiance with death, sicknesse or pouerty, and seekest to eschue these, thou art in the direct course of calamitie.
            
            
               CHAP. 7.
               Thou shalt therefore remoue

thy dislike from these thinges that are not in the compasse of our commaund, and make those the obiectes thereof, which are the essentiall opposites of those that ar vnder our moderation and gouernment. But as for appetite, let it not by any meanes haue accesse into thy thoughts as yet. For if thou affect what thou canst not attaine, thy desires must perforce bee frustrate. But how, or in what measure to affect the true and fit obiects of affect (such things I meane as are at our owne discretion) thou hast not as yet learned. Vse onely that

same 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that instinct, which attracteth the spirite vnto this, and with-draweth it from that: but this must bee with dilligent restraint, and moderation thereof in both respects.
            
            
               CHAP. 8.
               In all thinges that are either delectable, profitable, or amiable, be sure that thou do first of all examine their existence; beginning at matters of the least moment; if thou takest delight in such a pot or glasse, consider that it is but a pot, or a glasse that thou delightest in: so shall

not the breaking of that, breake the peace of thy minde. So, if thou loue thy wife, or children, consider that they are but mortals, on whom thy loue is laide, and so though they perish, thy quiet shall still suruiue.
            
            
               CHAP. 9.
               When thou entrest vpon any action, take an exact suruey of the nature thereof; as if thou goe to bathe, obserue both the necessary and the accidentall euents in bathing, that some are a washing, some are a thrusting out of the bathe, some rayling,

and other some stealing. And to goe surely to worke, propose but this to thy selfe, I will dispatch my bathing, and obserue the direct prescription of nature in this my purpose. And this likewise in all other designes. For this ground being laide, there is no inconuenience cā surprize the vnprouided. For this thou maiest say, I was not onely aware of this, but also resolued before, to follow my determination according to nature, how-so-euer. But if I doe grumble at any euent, then did I not obserue it before it befell.
            
            
               
               CHAP. 10.
               It is not the trunesse of things themselues, but mens indirect opinions thereof that fill their bosomes with perturbations. As for example: death is not euil in it selfe: for if it had bene so, Socrates would not haue said otherwise: but it is the opinion that men carry of death, which giueth it al the maleuolence it hath. Therfore in our crosses and incombrances, we should doe well to with-draw our accusations from others, and lay them vppon our selues and

our owne misprisions.
               To accuse others in any misfortune of our owne, is the character of ignorance: to accuse ones selfe, intimates some progresse in knowledge: but to accuse neither our selues nor others, argues perfection of vnderstanding.
            
            
               CHAP. 11.
               Neuer be proud of excellence in others: if an horsse should boast of him-selfe, and say I am a goodly beast, it were some-what tollerable, but for thee to cast forth thy braues that thou

hast such a goodly horse, is ridiculous, for thou art proud of thy horses person, and goodnesse, not thine owne. What is thine owne then? The vse of obiects: well then, when thou hast the habite of swaying these obiects according to the methode that nature hath prescribed, then boast and spare not, for by that time, thou maiest haue goods of thine owne to delight in.
            
            
               CHAP. 12.
               For as it is in nauigation, if the ship bee landed, and thou goest a shore for fresh

water, perhaps, by the way, thou maiest gather a cockle, or a scallion, or so, and yet not-with-standing thy minde is principally on the ship, and thine eare still attentiue on the maisters call, at which thou leauest all, and runnest, least thou bee chained and stowed vnder hatches, as they are faine to doe in transportation of sheepe: so in the maine voyage of this life, if thou lightest on a wife, or a childe, insteed of a cockle, or a scallion, thou mayest take them with-out trouble. But if the maister call, then, thou trudgest away,

then a boord, leauing thy trash, and neuer looking after it: well then, if thou beest aged, beware of wandring far from the ship, least the maister call, &amp; thou shouldst faint ere thou couldst come to bee imbarked.
            
            
               CHAP. 13.
               Thou oughtest not to wish that all euents should sort vnto thine affection: wisedome would rather aduise thee to wish the euents of all occurents to be such, as they are. Sicknesse is a clogge and a shackle vnto the body, but none to thy

minde vnlesse thou list thy selfe. Lamenesse incombers the legges, but not the resolution. This if thou doe but note in all other accidents, thou shalt finde them all to be rather encombrances, vnto al other things, then vnto thy determinations.
            
            
               CHAP 14.
               At all occasions, be ready to turn to thine own thoughts, and therin search the proper instructiōs which thou hast concerning the vses of what soeuer befalleth thee: if thou see a beautifull personage, call Temperance to hir taske,

and shee will come with alacrity. If thou meetest with paines, make thy buckler of pacience, which also is the surest shield for the repulse of reproache. Vse but thy selfe vnto this course, and thou shalt bee no more ouer-maystred by appearances.
            
            
               CHAP. 15.
               Let it neuer come forth of thy mouth that thou hast lost any thing: but that thou hast restored it. Thy sonne is dead: why then hee is restored vnto him that lent him thee. Thy

liuings are taken from thee. Why so then, are they not restored? No, for hee was a wicked man that gotte them from mee. Why, what is that to thee, what instruments he that gaue thee them will vse, for the taking them againe? as long as thou hast them, vse them, but as if they were an other mans, and this thou maiest learne by the trauellers vsage of his Inne, and lodging.
            
            
               CHAP. 16.
               If euer thou wilt attaine

to any progresse in goodnesse, thou must stand at vtter defiance with such cogitations as these: if I neglect mine owne estate, I shall want whereon to liue. If I correct not my sonne, he will neuer bee good. It is farre better to starue with hunger, and so bee quit at once from the feeling of feare and molestation, then to liue in aboundance of all externall goods, with a minde perturbed, and voide of all inward content. And it is better to see badnesse in ones sonne, then to feele misery in ones selfe.
            
            
               
               CHAP. 17.
               Begin at the lowest steppe of the worlds occasions. Is thine oile spilt, or thy farme spoiled? well, suppose this with thy selfe: this I pay for my peace of conscience, and this for my constancie in troubles: nothing is gotten for gramercy. And when thou callest thy boy, presuppose that he will not come, or if he doe, that hee will do nothing as thou wouldest haue him. But euer beware of this, that it lye not in his power to perturbe thy setled quiet at his pleasure.
            
            
               
               CHAP. 18.
               If thou ayme at perfection in Phylosophy, neuer make bones of beeing reputed a foole or an asse in worldly respectes: Nor mayst thou professe any knowledge at any hand. If thou seeme wise vnto others, yet distrust it thy selfe. For bee thou well assured of this, that it is an enterprise of extreme difficulty to containe thy determinations in the partes which nature and reason hath proposed, and yet to admit the fruition of things externall:

               If thy care to keep thy wife, children, friends, and family, in perpetuall fulnesse of health and externall happines, thou shewest thy self a foole, for thou indeauorest to sway those thinges that stand without the compasse of thy power, and to turn external goods into reall ones. Now if thy will be that thy sonne should not runne into enormities, thou art a

foole in that. For thy desire is, that error should not bee error, but of some other nature. But if thy desire bee not to bee frustrate in thy wishes, this may be allowed thee.

               That man is absolute Lord ouer euery thing, who at his owne pleasure can preserue or deliuer the things which his will is to preserue or deliuer: He therefore that will bee free, must neither desire nor dislike any thing that is in the power of others to dispose of. Otherwise, hee

must take the yoake whether he will or no.

               Remember that this life, is but as a banquet. If any one carue to thee take part of ye peece with modesty, and returne the rest: is the dish set from thee? stay it not: is it not yet come to thee? gape not after it, but expect it with sober behauiour. Beare but this hand on thine affections to thy wife, thy children, dignities, and possessions, and thou shalt in time bee a fitte guest for the banquets of the Gods. But admitte

that a profer of some of those bee made thee: if then thou doe truly despise and refuse it, thou shalt not onely bee worthy to share with the Gods in their banquets, but euen in their glories. By this meanes did Diogenes, Heraclitus, and others, purchase that epithite worthy their reuerend cariage, Diuine.

               When thou seest any one lamenting either because his son is gon to trauel, or for some other temporall mishap, bee sure to carry a wary

respect vnto thy self, that the sight hereof breed no alteration in thy thoughts, as to perswade thee that it is those externall goodes that haue brought downe this calamity vppon him: But rather make a distinction with thy selfe, and bee readye to tell thy thoughts this tale: It is not this casualty that afflicts this man (for had it befalne some other it would not haue afflicted him) but it is his owne mis-apprehension hereof, that maketh him mone thus. Thus resolued, doe not doubt to minister the best counsell that thou canst afforde to asswage

his passion, to which end thou maist lawfully put on a forme of teares to associate his teares. But bee sure thy minde bee not any way molested, looke to that aboue all things.

to represent the imposed person, ingeniously, and industriouslye. So like-wise must thou doe in the parts of a cripple, a King, or a common Plebeian. It is thy duty to discharge thine appointed part with discretion, but what part thou shalt haue allotted thee, is left vnto the direction of another.

               When thou beholdest a man high-topt with honors, proud in rich possession, and flourishing in externall felicities, beware that thine eye do not cause thy tongue to call that man happy. For if true tranquility haue hir feate onely in thinges that lye wholy at our dispose, then must there bee no place there, eyther for enuy or emulation, nor must thy desires flye eyther after Confulshippes nor Kingdomes, but after freedome.

               Remember that hee that shall iniure thee by word, or violence, is not the author of that iniury him-selfe, but the opinion which causeth thee to hold those actions as disgracefull and iniurious. Wherefore when any one derideth thee, know that is but thine owne opinion that suggesteth this to be a derision. And therefore haue an

especiall care to curbe thy minde from too quick assenting to thine eye. Gette but a little time of the obiect, ere thou giue vp thine assent, and thou shalt haue thy iudgement at a farre easier command.

But let not statelinesse bee found in

thee: such thinges as shall seeme to participate really of goodnesse, sticke to them as firme as if GOD himselfe hadde fixt thy station therein: and assure thy selfe that if thou continue this course, they that derided thee heretofore, will admire thee here-after. But if thy spirit yeeld vnto their scoffs, then doubtlesse shalt thou incurre a redoubled derision.

               Let it neuer greeue thee to be destitute of honours, and places of state: for if it bee an euill thing to lacke preferment, then haue externall things alike power to draw thee into inconuenience,

&amp; into vice. Is it thy part then to hunt after dignity? or to wish to be inuited to such or such a great mans banquet? O by no meanes. What reproache then can once touch thee? or how is it possible that thou canst want an honorable place, when thou maiest bee Lord and Soueraigne ouer all those goods which are peculiar adhaerents to the nature of man? O but I cannot benefit my friends: No? who told you so? It may be thou not canst aide them with money, nor procure them the freedome of the citty: what then? Did

euer man teach thee that these were not the gifts of others, nor excluded wholye from our disposings? And who will helpe another to that which hee wanteth himselfe? I but wee intreate you (say they) to vse but some meanes where-by wee may attaine this or that: Well, if I may doe so with-out iniury to mine honesty, my faith, and the high pitch of mine owne thoughts, and that you will shew me how, I wil vse all the meanes I can for you. But if you care not if I lose my true goods to purchase you things only seeming

good, is that a part of honest friendship, or of head-long fondnesse? What doe you make choise of? an honest friend, or an heauy purse? If you approoue the first, then assist mee in the preseruation of mine honesty, and be not the causes of employing mee in those businesses whereby I should bring all my goodnesse to nothing.
               O but I haue yet no meanes to benefite my countrey! As how man? you cannot builde it a schoole, an Exchange, or a Bathe: what's all that to the purpose? the Armorer

doth not store the commonwealth with shooes, nor the sho-omaker with armes. It sufficeth euery man to containe him-selfe in his owne vocation. Now if thou perchance should by thine instructions ingraff true goodnesse in some other of thy country-men, shouldst thou not benefit thy country? assure thy selfe thou shouldst: thou art no vnprofitable member in the state then. Yea but what place shall I hold then (saiest thou) in the body politique? Euen what place so euer thou canst with the saue-gard of thy modesty and integrity▪ but

if thou casheere them to pleasure thy country, what vse shall a good state haue of one giuen ouer to impudence and treachery?

               Doost thou see any one preferred before thee at banquets, in salutations, or in councels? well, if these be good things, thou oughtest to congratulate with him to whom they are befallen. But if they be euills, greeue not that thou hast missed them, but remember, that seeing it is not thy study to pursue those things that are not in

a mans owne power to dispose of, thou canst not possibly haue those graces alotted thee, that others haue, whose study is all vpon that obiect. For how shall hee that doth not attend continually at a great mans doore, haue equall place in his fauour with him that doth giue this due attendance? or he that waites not at his heeles, with him that doth? or he that flatters him not, with him that doth? vniust and insatiable therefore should thine affections be, if thou pay not the due price for things that are thus saleable, and yet thinke to haue

them giuen thee gratis: For admitte this comparison: what's the price of a dish of lettice? say an halfe-peny. Well, one comes, payes his halfe-peny and hath his lettice: if thou pay nothing, and so haue none, doost thou thinke thy selfe in worse place then hee that had of them? no, thou hast no reason to do so, for as hee hath his lettice, so thou hast paid no price. Euen so it is here. Thou art not inuited vnto some great mans banquet? why, nor hast thou defrayed the price that the banquet is sold for: namely praise, and flattory for which the

maker there-of setteth it foorth to sayle. Pay then the price of it, if it like thee to pertake of it. But if thou wilt not performe the first, and yet desirest to enioy the latter, thy thoughts are basely couetous and deiectd. Well then insteed of this feast, thou hast nothing. No? yes that thou hast: thou hast not pleased him whom thou couldst not finde in thine heart to praise; nor hast thou been forced to endure his insolence, by eating of his viands.

               The prescriptions of nature are layde downe apparantly, euen in things wherof all the world hath one opinion. As for example: if thy neighbours childe doe breake a glasse, or such like, euery one presently can say it was a chance. Why know then, that if it had beene thine owne, that had beene broken, thou oughtest to be perturbed no more, then thou wast at the breaking of thy neighbors. Now ascend from this vnto things of greater moment: thy neighbours

wise, or his childe dyeth. Euery one can say, Why! wee are all mortall; what remedie! but when his owne goes, then presently hee bursteth forth with, O woe is mee! O mee most wretched man! whereas in very deed wee ought now chiefelye to remember how wee stoode affected when wee heard of the like casualtie be fallen others.

               As the markes in shooting are not sett to make the Archer leuell wide: so

like-wise wee see in nature there is nothing essentiallye euill. If any man by chance should fall a strikeing thee, and another stand by and let him alone, thou wouldest thinke hardly of him: and art not thou ashamed then to lette thy thoughts bee iniured by euery man, and to be greeued and vexed at the scoffes of euery one? bee aduised then, and aduenture vpon nothing with-out due consideration of the precedences and consequences therof, and then proceed, freely. Other-wise thou maist well go cheerfully about it in the

beginning (hauing not obserued the accidents depending there-vpon) but in the processe of the worke, thou art sure to bee chased from proceeding by some disgracefull obstacle or other.

               Wouldest thou be victor in the Olympick games? In troth and so would I, it is a glory of great esteeme. But marke what doth ordinarylye fore-runne it, and what followeth it: and then enter the lists: thou must bee tyed to keepe order, to eate but when needs must, to forbeare

all delicacies, to vse necessary excercises, at set times, to drinke no cold water, nor wine but at prescribed seasons: brieflye, you must bee as obsequious to your Wrastlers and your Fencers prescriptions as you would bee to your Physitians. And then you come to the tryall: where the hand perhaps is hurt, or the anckle wrested: downe you goe in the dust, and rise perhaps with your mouths full thereof: here maist thou get thy skin full of strokes, and be ouer-throwne when all is done. Consider all this wel, and then if you like,

it, turne champion and spare not. If not thou must retire as little children doe, that now play the Wrastlers, now the Fencers, and by and by the Fidlers, now they sound the Trumpets, and presently they present the tragedies: Euen so shalt thou doe; one while being a wrastler, another while a Fencer, then an Oratour, and lastly a Philosopher: but indeed, directly nothing: but as an Ape doth, imitating all thou seest, and posting in thine affections perpetually from one obiect to another. The reason is, thou takest no premeditation of the depences

of what-so-euer thou goest about, but hurlest on vnto action with-out all discretion, being wholy swayed by the leuity of appetite. Such a company were they who hearing a Philosopher say: O how truly spake Socrates in this? nay what man on earth can speake as hee did? would needes here vpon in all hast, turne flatte Philosophers.

               Man, consider first the nature of the thing that thou intendest, &amp; secondly, thine owne nature, whether they

two may hold good correspondence together or no. Hast thou desire to proceede maister in the fiue exercises? or in Wrestling onely? Why looke vpon thine armes, thighes, and legges, and examine them all well: for these are naturall assistants one to another. Doost thou thinke that in these courses, thou canst eate, drinke, and abstaine, all in one measure? Thou must labour, thou must watch, thou must leaue thy friends, thou must become an obiect for the very scorne of children, thou must bee debased vnder all

men besides thee in honors, offices, counsels, and in 
                     •
                  ll causes whatsoeuer: lay these things to thine heart, &amp; resolue with thy selfe whether thou wouldst change thy peace, freedome, and constancie of minde, for these other endowments. If thou wouldst not, then follow the fashion of boyes no longer to bee now a Philosopher, now a Publican, now an orator, &amp; tomorrow the deputy of Caesar. Here is no cohaerence in these things: to be a man fixt, either in goodnesse or badnesse, is a mans part. Thou must either practise thy reason and vnderstanding,

or giue all thy seruice to the world, and the worlds dependances. Thy labor must be emploied either abroad or at home: that is thou must either bee a professed Philosopher, or a direct member of the vulgar.

               All offices of man in this world are to bee proportionate by mutuall affections. Hast thou a father? that name cōmands thy diligent care of him, and thy forbearance of him in all things: binding thy pacience to endure his worst callumnies and most iniurious violences.

Imagine him a wicked man: hath nature then alotted thee a good father? no, but a father shee hath: well, then doe thy duty to him with all diligence, stand not to examine his actions, but to foresee, that in all thine actions vnto him the ordinance of nature be kept inuiolate. So shall no man hurt thee, vnlesse thou list thy selfe: and when thou supposest thy selfe hurt, then shalt thou bee hurt indeed. This is thy way to discerne the duty of a neighbour, a citizen, or an Emperour, by a dayly speculation of their mutuall concords.
            
            
               
               CHAP. 38.
               Know, that the first and formost point of religion is a true beleefe: to bee assuredly perswaded, that there is a God, and that he swayeth the state of the whole vniuerse, in goodnesse and in iustice: that we must obey him, &amp; assent vnto his commands in the smallest condition: approouing all his actions, and following their directions as the effects of that purest &amp; most glorious Intellect. Thus dooing, thou shalt neuer haue cause to repine at him, nor to repute

him negligent of thee. Now this cannot bee, vnlesse thou reiect the things that lye not in thy power to dispose of, and place the whole nature of good and euill in those things whose order is tyed vnto mans owne discretion. For if thou binde, either goodnesse or badnesse to any of the other, it is vnpossible that thou shouldst not accuse the author of them, and grow into an hate of him, when-soeuer thou art deceiued of what thou desiredst, and fallest into that which thou soughtest to auoyd. For it is inherent in euery creature

by nature, to abhorre and eschue the originall causes of all that seemeth hurtfull, as well as the effects themselues: and contrarywise, to follow, and admire the causes and productions of all that seemeth vse-full. Hee therefore that thinketh himselfe iniured, hath small reason to reioyce in that hee seemeth to iniurie the other againe: for it is impossible that losse should bee parent vnto true delight. But this erronious conceit, maketh the sonne to disparage the father, when hee doth not allowe him enough of that

which opinion holdeth for a true good, and this made Eteocles and Polinices go together by the eares for their fathers Empire, because they thought there was such a deale of happinesse included in soueraignty. This maketh the husband-man curse the heauens one while and the sea-man another while: the merchant also, &amp; the man that burieth his wife or children: For these mens piety is inseperably chained vnto their profit. But he whose endeuor worketh for a due moderation of his desire, &amp; dislike, herein laieth down a good ground

or his piety also. Now as or sacrifices and offrings, et each one obserue the custome of the land wherein hee liueth: dooing it with purity, parsimonie, diligence, cleannesse, and with-in the compasse of his ability.

               When thou goest vnto a diuinatour, remember that thou knowest not the end of that thou goest about, but goest to learne that of him. But if thou beest a Philosopher, thou knowest the quality of it ere thou goest.

For if it concerne a thing that is not in the power of man, it is impossible that it should bee either good or euil. So that when thou commest to the Sooth-sayer, be sure thou leaue both dislike, and desire behinde thee: otherwise, thou shalt neuer approach his face without feare. But sette downe thy staffe at this, what euer the end bee, it no way concerneth thee: For thou hast power to make vse of it, come in what shape soeuer it will: And in this none in the World can bee thy hinderance. And therefore come to the Goddes, as to

thy counsellors with a bold spirit: and when thou hast hard their wils, remember who are thy Councellors, and how great a contempt thou shalt committe in disobeying their direction. But if thou come to the Oracle (as it pleased Socrates to do) about a thing whose whole consideration relyeth vppon the euent; &amp; wherin neither Art nor Reason can aide thee with knowledge of the dependances, then must thou ruminate vpon the first head therof: therfore if thou beest to vndergo the defence of thy friend or countrey wt danger of thine own person

neuer go to aske the Augure whether thou shouldst defend them or no. For if he tel thee the intrailes presage misfortune, it is likely that he meaneth eyther of death, or the laming of some member, or of banishment. But then comes reason on the other side, and this withall: The daunger that I vndergo, my friend and countrey vndergoeth also with mee. And therefore herein take councell of that great Pythian Prieste, who expelled one out of the Temple for not helping his friend in a mortall extremity.

If thine occasion bee so that thou must go thus, why bear these ordinary occurrents, &amp; neuer say vnto thy self, I haue knowne him keep a lesser state: to say thus, were common grosenesse, peculiar onley to him that raileth at externall shadowes.

that meanes giue him notice of his errour.

them with this, that if thou abstaine, thou shalt haue cause of ioy, and occasion to commend thine owne circumspection. If thou beest thē to vnder-go any delightful actiō, take heed that thou beest not intangled in the sweete inticements thereof: but sette this against them all: O how much more excellent is it for a man to haue his conscience tell him that he hath conquered all these allurements!

Now if his iudgemente sayle him, why then hee that is deceiued hath the losse fallen on

his side. For hee that shall define an vndiscouered truth to bee a lye, wrongs not the truth herein, but is wronged him-selfe, by his misconceite of the truth.

For the sheepe doe not bring their fodder to the shepheards, and shew them what they haue eaten, but decocting the meate they haue feede vppon, giue the proose hereof in their wooll, and in their milke.

all things: to neglect his being held a foole, or an ignorant fellow: and finally, to keepe a guard ouer himselfe, as ouer a treacherous enemy.

But what is the ayme of my study? the knowledge of nature, and the following

of that knowledge, who shall teach mee then? Chrysippus saith one. Well, to Chrysippus I goe. But now cannot I conceiue him. Well, then must I goe seeke an expositour: so then as yet I haue done nothing worth nameing. But when I haue gotten an expositor, then remaineth it that I make vse of all his instructions, and there is the matter of most moment. But if I stand onely in admiration of his acute expositions, why then what prooue I but a Grammarian in steed of a Philosopher? sauing onely this, that I read Chrysippus in stead of Homer.
                  
Therefore when any one intreateth me to read Chrysippus to him, I am ashamed, because I cannot confirme my doctrine with my deeds.

Thou hast as good rules giuen thee for thy reformation, as could possibly bee prescribed, and thou hast imbraced them: Why then dost thou looke for any more maisters, and deferrest to reduce thy selfe vnto order, vntill some such man appeare: Thou art now past a boy: add maturity enstileth thee a man. If therefore thou continue still in

thy neglect, adding delaye vnto delay, purpose to purpose, and putting of all things vntill to morrowe, will it not bee as apparant as the light, that thou shalt neuer profitte any thing, but liue and dye a man of base condition? assure thy selfe it will. Bee wise then, and put thy selfe into the course of a full man, and make that which thou seest to bee good, the perpetuall lawe, and inuiolable rule of thine actions. And when thou meetest with labour or delight, with honor or with disgrace, then tell thy selfe that now thou

art in the Olympike games; that now there is no starting back: and that onely our stay, or encombrance, may either detaine thy progresse long, or destroy it for euer. Thus became Socrates the man that he was, being his owne furtherer in all attempts, and following the directions of none but Reason. And as for thee, though thou beest not a Socrates, yet oughtest thou to liue as one that intendeth to attaine to Socrates his perfection.

               The first, and most necessary precept in all Philosophye, concerneth the vse of their decrees, as in this, of speaking euer-more the truth. The next, disposeth of the demonstrations, as in this; why must one speake euer-more truelye? the third, confirmeth and distinguisheth both the former, as thus; How can this bee a demonstration? what is a demonstration? what is the demonstration here? what i ye consequence? what is the difference? which

is the truth? which is the falshood? So that this third place dependeth necessarily vpon the second, and the second vpon the first: But the base, the foundation, and most necessary place of all, is the first. But wee take another course, wee keepe (all of vs) a terrible coyle with the third place, beating our braines wholye about that, whilest the first in the meane space lieth out of all eustome, vnrespected of any man. And therefore wee doe incurre the offence of lying: yet euery one hath the demonstration that one should not lye at his

tongues end.

            The table of Cebes, the Theban Philosopher: Containing a prescript method for the well ordering of the life of man.
            AS wee were walking in the temple of Saturne, and viewing the diuerse gifts of charitable persons, amongst the rest wee espied a table, hung vp before the doore of the Oratorie, contayning many strange, and vncouth resemblances, the meaning whereof wee could not possibly coniecture, for the picture bare neither

the forme of citty, nor of campe, but it consisted of three parkes as it were, or enclosures: one, a large one, and within that, two other, a greater and a lesser. In the greatest enclosure of all, there was a gate, about the which was a great concourse of people drawne: &amp; within, there were a many in the formes of women. In the entrance, there stood the picture of a graue aged man, who seemed to giue some directions to the per▪sons as they entred, much talke had wee about the signification of this potraiture, but none could conceiue

truely what it should intend. At last, as we were in this doubt, an ancient man that stood by, stept vnto vs, and told vs: Strangers (quoth he) it is no wonder if this picture trouble you to vnderstand the true meaning thereof: for there are but fewe of our owne Cittizens that can giue the true interpretation hereof as hee that offered it, intended. For it was none of this city that gaue it, but a stranger, a worthy man, and a true follower of Pythagoras and Parmenides, both in doctrine and conuersation, comming

to this Citty, dedicated both this Temple, and this Table vnto the seruice of GOD Saturne. Did you know the man Sir, quoth I? yes, quoth hee, that I did, and was an auditor of his admired doctrine a long time, for euen in his yonger yeares, his instructions bare great perfection, and lustre: many a time haue I heard him teach the exposition of this table vnto his followers. I beseech you sir, quoth I, if your businesse be not of greater import, to expound the meaning hereof vnto vs, for I assure you, our desires to know it are vehement.

Truly strangers (quoth hee) and my leasure serueth mee to satisfie you, but you must take one caueat with you, more then you are aware off, and that is this: the exposition hereof is attended with much danger. What danger sir, quoth I? Mary this quoth he: if you giue gōod eare vnto the discourse that you shall heare, and fix your memories with a true vnderstanding, it will crowne you with wisedome and beatitude: if not, it will plunge you in a boundlesse depth of all dulnesse &amp; misery. For this explanation resembleth the riddle of Sphynx, wherwith

with shee vsed to intrappe poore passengers, he that could vnderstand it, passed safe, but hee that did not was sure to pay for his ignorance with his life. Euen so is it here. For Ignorance is a Sphynx vnto man. And this obscure picture, conteyneth a description of all the good and euill that lackeyeth the life of man: As also of all that which is indifferent and pertaketh of neyther. Now if a man conceiue not this aright, it will not dispatch him at once, as the Sphynx did those that fell into her clawes: But it will infect his whole

life wt a continual corrosion; and such a torment as those seek, who being condemned &amp; giued, do euery moment expect the hand of the hangman. But contrarywise, if one apprehend it with a true conceit, Ignorance breaketh his owne necke, and the whole course of his life that vnderstandeth it aright; shal be replenished with perfect beatitude. Marke my words therefore well, and lette them not go in at one eare and out at another. Lord God (quoth I) how haue you inflamed vs with a desire to heare this relation, if all be thus: yes assuredly quoth he

it is euen thus. Proceed sir I beseech you quoth I, for wee bee no negligent auditors in a matter of so great hope, or so great hurt vnto the hearers. So the old man lifting vp his staffe, and pointing to the picture: See you this incloser, quoth he? Yes very well: why then marke me: This is called LIFE: and the great multitude you see flocke about the gate, are such as are to enter into the the course of this life. And that old man whom ye see with a paper in one hand, &amp; seeming to point out something therein with the other, is called, Lifes GENIVS.

Hee instructeth those that enter, what methode to obserue in their course of life, and layeth them downe what they must follow, vpon perill of their owne destructions. I pray you what kinde of life (sir) doth hee direct them to follow, said I? or how doth hee will them to proceed? See you not a Throne, quoth hee, neere vnto the gate as the people goe in, and a woman sitting thereon witth a visor on her face, in queint apparell, and a cup in her hand? Yes that I doe, quoth I, what is shee? It is IMPOSTVRE, quoth hee, that seduceth

all the world. What doth she? she drinketh of her owne brewing vnto all men liuing, what drinke is it? It is Error, quoth hee, and Ignorance: and how then? why when they haue tasted of this cuppe, then enter they, the course of life: Why but tell mee sir, doe all then drinke of Errour? All quoth hee, but some indeede drinke more, and other some lesse.
            And behold, see you not a crue of women atttired like whores, there within the gate? yes, sir. Why those are called Opinions, Desires, and Pleasures,
               
and as soone as any come in at the gate, presently these run dancing to them, fall to dalliance with them and so lead them whether they list. Whether lead they them, said I? Some to security, said hee, &amp; some to ruine, by Impostures meanes. Oh worthy sir, how dangerous a drinke haue you told me of! Nay, when they come first vnto men, quoth hee, they make them promises of all delights, of perpetuall security in perfect beatitude: now the men, being drunke with the Error, and Ignorance that Imposture presented them, cannot

for their liues finde the right way to that good course, but goe wandring about they know not whether, as you see them described in the picture. And you see them that were entred before, goe round about as these women direct them. I doe indeed, quoth I; but what woman is that, that stands vpon that round stone, seeming as though shee were blinde, and carrying a semblance of madnesse in her gesture: that same quoth he is FORTVNE, her blindnesse is not single, but accompanied with madnesse, and deafenesse. Why what doth

shee there then? Shee wanders about, quoth he, taking from one, and giuing to another, and by and by taketh that away which shee gaue but euen now, and bestoweth it vpon a third, with-out all reason or constancie; and therefore her token there speaketh her nature at full. Which is that, quoth I? her standing vpon that round stone. What is the meaning of that? that her gifts are neuer secure nor certaine. For hee that buildeth his trust vpon them, shall bee sure one day to pay deerely for his credulity. What names beare they? They are

called Fooles: How chanceth it that some of them weepe, and some laugh? why are they not all in one form? They that laugh and reioice are Fortunes fauourites, and salute her by the title of Prosperous. But they that wring their hands &amp; waile, are such as shee hath depriued of that which shee had giuen them before, and they call her Aduerse fortune. What are her giftes then, that they should make the loosers lament, and the receiuers reioyce? Her gifts, are Reputed goods: and what be those? Ritches, Nobility, children, glory, soueraignty,

Empire and such like. And I pray sir, hold you these for good? Of that heereafter, quoth hee: let vs now make an end of the tables exposition. With all mine heart sir. You see now that beeing past that gate, there is another enclosure, lying higher vppe, and seauen women accoutred like curtizans, standing without at the enterance. All this I see. Well, one of these is called Incontinence, another Luxury, another Auarice, and another, Flattery: &amp; what stand they for there? They watch when Fortune bestoweth any thing vpō any man: how then? then

they reioyce, and embrace him, and flatter him, and intreate him to staye with them, promising him a life, fraught with all the delight that the most vnbounded affect can desire. If any one doe like this, and tarry with them, hee is tickled with false delight, that free imagineth his life an heauen, when indeed it is nothing so. For when his vnderstanding r
                  •
               turneth, then hee will soone perceiue that hee hath not eaten at their charges, but that they haue eaten vp him, and when they had so done, sent him away with his sound burden of derisio

And now hauing brought al the benefits of fortune vnto nothing, hee must turne drudge to those drabs, suffer all their imperious iniuries, and vndergo all vnseemely offices for their pleasures, as cousenage, sacriledge, treachery, the euery, and all the rest of that vngratious beadroll. And when all those impious trades fayle him, then is hee packt ouer into the hands of Punishment. Punishment, which is she? Doe you not perceiue a little grate in the picture, behinde those women, and within that, as it were an obscure dungeon? Yes. And a great

many women all in tattred ragges, and forlorne shapes? I see them also Why that same that holdeth the scourge, is called Punishment: shee that leaneth her head vppon her knee, is Sadnesse. Shee that teareth her hayre, hight Sorrow. There standes one also behinde them, all deformed, meager, and naked, and a woman with him, bearing the same figure of leane deformity. Who bee they? The mans name, quoth he, is Anguish, and the womans Desperation: vnto these is the ruined man passed ouer, and confined to liue in dolefull extremitie.

From thence they driue him farther, into the Iayle of Infelicity, and there shall his captiuity be endlesse vnlesse Repentance bee his baile. Why, what can she do? Mary shee can deliuer him out of this huge deluge of miseries, and bring him acquainted with another Opinion, and another Desire, who will guide him vnto the pallace of True Instruction: and will also proferre to conduct him vnto False Instruction. And how then, quoth I? If hee embrace that Opinion that giueth him directions in the way of True vnderstanding hee shalbe thereby

purified, and reformed, and runne the rest of his liues course in the plentitude of perfectiō, beyond the reach of all future calamity: otherwise, if he do not so, False instruction will subuert him with a new deceipt. O God (said I) how dangerous is this last difference! But what shape hath this same False Instruction? Behold yonder other enclosure, saith he. So I doe sir. At the portall thereof sitteth a woman in neate and seemly habite: the vulgar and the vainer sorte call her Instruction, whereas indeed hir true name is false instruction. Now they that

meane to passe vnto true Instruction? Do all come first vnto this woman. Why is there no other way then this vnto true Instruction? Yes that there is. Who are they then that walke about within that inclosure? They are the followers of false Instruction, imagining in themselues (but al too erroneously) that they inioy the company of true instruction. And what are their professions? Some of them are Poets, some Orators, some Logitians, some Musitians, Arithmetique, Geometry, Astrology, Phylosophy, Criticisme, and all other professions haue bastards

within this ring: nay here are prosessed voluptuaries also. But what women are those that conuerse with them in the habites of those former, amongst whome you reckoned Incontinence and her fellowes? They are the self-same. What, do they come hether also? That they doe, but not so ordinarily as else-where, into the first enclosure. And do the Opinions come thus far also. Yes verily doe they: for the drinke that Imposture giueth these, euen at first, is not yet out of their heads, they doe as yet smell of the dregs of Error and Ignorance: nor shall

they euer be quitte of their Opinions, or their other vices vntill they renounce the cō
               pany of False Instruction, and take them-selues to the true course, &amp; taking the potion that is called Errors purgatiō, thereby vomit vp all ye euils that offended their mindes, as their Opinions, their Ignorance, and all their other enormities: for so shall their consciences be perfectly cured. But as long as they remaine with false Instruction, they shall neuer be throughly sound, nor shall their disciplines helpe them away with any one incouenience. Which is the way then that

leadeth vnto true instruction. Why look you here, see you this high place that seemes as desart and vnhabited. Well sir, I see it. Then you see that little gate, and the way there before the gate, which looks as if it were but little vsed, lying in such a steepe discent of that craggy rock. That I see also: you see more-ouer that hill there, that is enuironed on eyther side with inaccessible cliffes, hauing onely one narrow path whereby to ascend it: True sir. That same path, is all the way wee haue to true Instruction. Truly sir mee thinketh it is almost impossible

to get vp it. You marke that steepe rock then by that other hill. So I doe. And see you not two lusty and comely Viragoes standing thervppon, &amp; reaching forth their hands in manner of a cheerfull inuitation. I see them well, but how call you their names? One of them hight Continency, and the other Tollerance: and they are sisters. VVhy doe they reach forth their hands? They incourage the trauelers that come that way, to bee of good cheere, and to defie desperation the daughter of sluggishnesse; assuring them, that after a

little toile, the whole residue of their life shalbe topt with happy tranquillity, and that if they will climbe but a little, all the way after shall bee most plaine and easie. But when they come to the rock how shal they doe to ascend? I see no meane they haue to mount so steep a cliffe. True, but the two sisters do come downe them-selues from the toppe, and lending them their handes, pull them vppe by degrees. After they are gotten vp a little way, they bidde them rest a little, and then they bring Fortitude &amp; Confidence vnto them, and passe their wordes to bring

them to the presence of True Instruction, shewing them how plaine and how pleasant the tract is, now that they haue surmounted the former difficulty, and how cleare it is from all cragges and incombrances, as you see in the Table. So indeed it seemes. And see you not that wood, and before it, as it were a pleasant launde, or meade? Al full of light &amp; delight? Right: and in the midst therof another enclosure wt a gate vnto it? There is so: but how cal you that enclosure? mary it is called ye 
               habitation of the blessed, for in that place are al the vertues resident wt
               
beatitude. Truly it lookes like a delightfull abode. You see then that goodly matron that stands by the gate, with a constant eie of a midle age, rather inclining to fiftie, in a plaine and vngarnished habite, and standing vppon a stone not round but cubike, and directly square? Shee hath two other women also neare her that seem to be hir daughters. So they do. The mid most of these three is called Instruction
               ▪ she of the one hand, Truth, and she on the other, Perswasion. But why doth Instruction stand vppon a square stone? To shewe that the path which

leadeth vnto her is faire and firme: and that her gifts doe blesse the receiuer with fruits of security. What doth shee giue? She giueth Confidence, Security, &amp; Acquittance from troubles. And what vse of those? By these man vnderstandeth that his life is now to continue voide of all perturbations. Oh glorious, oh gratious gifts quoth I! but why doth she stand without the enclosure? to cure the trauellers, &amp; giue them her drink before they enter, and then to admit them passage in, vnto the vertues. How is this good sir quoth I? In truth I conceiue you

not. You shall, quoth hee. It is heere, as if a person greatly diseased should betake his body to the cure of the Phisitian: now hee, first of all, purgeth away the causes, and nutriment of the malady, and then corroborates the vitalls, and finally confirmeth the body in perfect soundnesse. Now if the person had contemned the counsels of Phisicke, hee had been deseruedly giuen ouer to the tyranny of his disease. This I conceiue, quoth I. Well, euen thus quoth hee, do men approach this station of Instruction, which as soone as they arriue at, presently

shee cureth them, giuen her owne receipt vnto them which purgeth out all their ingulphed euills, as by vomit or eiection. What are the euils they cast vp. Error and Ignorance, both which they drunke from the hand of Imposture, Arrogance also, Auarice, Desire, Incontinence, Anger, and all the poysons which they swallowed downe while they were in the first enclosure. And whether doth shee send them hauing purged them? Shee letteth them in vnto Knowledge and the other vertues. Which bee they? Why see you not a

company of faire &amp; modest matrons there within the gate, amongst whome there is not one that seemeth painted, or curiously adorned, as they before were all? I see them: what are their names? The fore-most of them, hight knowledge, the rest are her sisters, called by the names of Fortitude, Iustice, Integrity of life, Temperance, Modesty, Liberality, Continency, &amp; (Clemency. Oh goodly consort! quoth I. How great is humane hope? your hopes quoth he shalbe complete, if you conceiue this relation aright, and apply it vnto your courses

in the world. Sir, assure your selfe, quoth I, wee will omitte no paines herein. Then shall your endes bee crowned with security, quoth hee. But whether doe these Vertues lead the man that enters? Vnto their mother. What is shee? Her name is BEATITVDE. Of what quality is she? See you not a way that ascendeth that height there, whereon the tower of the three enclosures is founded? Behold there a faire and flourishing matrone, enthroned in state, at the portch of the sayd tower in goodly raiment, yet vntaxable of profusenesse,

with a crown of roses about her beauteous temples. You say right sir, what is she? she is the person, that is called Beatitude. And when one commeth to her, what doth shee? Shee crowneth him (quoth he) with delight adioyned vnto all the other vertues, as they are crowned that are victors in dangerous conflicts: what conflicts hath he bin in, said I? In many sore ones, quoth hee: and hath conquered many a sauage beast that wounded him pitifully, &amp; ouerthrew him often: yet brought he al their fury vnder, and now is become his owne man, making

those sauages serue him now, as hee was forced to stoope to them before: What beasts are they you speake of, sir? I would faine know that. I speake of Ignorance and Error, first: are not they true beasts? yes, and cruel ones too, quoth I. And then, quoth he I speak of Sorrovv, Anguish, Auarice, Intemperance, and the whole Lernean fen of vicious habits. All these hath he now at command, whereas before they cōmanded him. O renowned victory, quoth I, and memorably performed! but I pray sir tell me this, what force is there

in the crowne shee giueth him? A blessed force (young man) there is in that crown. He whose browes it encircleth, shall be really blessed, and lift vp beyond the pitch of misery: nor shall his blisse relye vppon others, but bee fully established in him-self. Oh what a conquest is there! But what doth hee when he hath this crowne? whether goeth he then? Then the vertues bring him backe the same way that he came, and shewe him those that liue there beneath, how miserable and how mischieuous their estate is, and how they dash the ship of their life against

the rocks, keeping no course but rouing at randome without all care or compasse: and how they are ledde away to bondage by their foes, some by Incontinence, som by Arrogance, som by Auarice, some by Vainglory, some by one mean of ruine &amp; some by another. And out of these giues of perdition they haue no meanes in the world to redeeme themselues, but there they lye in fetters of perturbation, all their liues long. The reason hereof is, they haue forgottē the instruction that Lifes Genius gaue them at their ingresse, and so cannot light

of the true course of life. In truth you say well, but why should the Vertues goe to shew him the place and perills that hee had already passed? He tell you why. At his former passage of them, hee conceiued not the halfe of their maleuolence, nor vnderstood the actions that were done there, almost any thing: but was altogether enui
                  •
               oned with doubts, because of the drinke of Error &amp; Ignorance which hee had tasted, which made him imagine that for good, which had no goodnesse in it, and so in like maner of euill. Whereby hee

was thrust into the course of corruption aswell as the rest were. But now that he hath attained the knowledge of conueniences, hee both beholdeth the misery of others, and enioyeth felicity himselfe. But when hee hath obserued the misfortunes of these men, what doth hee then? or whether goeth he? faith euen whether hee lift himselfe. For he is as secure in euery place as if hee were in the caue of Corycum: and let him liue were hee will, hee shall liue in honesty and free from all, euen the least encombrance. All men shalbe as glad of his

company as the sicke person is of the Phisitians why but shall he neuer more stand in feare of those beasts you spoke of? shall they haue no more power to touch him? no, not a iot. Hee shall stand at defiance with Sorrow, Trouble, Incontinence, Auarice, Need, and all other extreames whatsoeuer: hee shall check and curbe them now as he pleaseth, who before plagued him worse then the stings of adders, and as the serpents that kill all other things with their poyson, medle not with the viper, because his owne venime is an Amulet against all

theirs: so likewise shall no euill approach this perfect man, because in himselfe hee hath a preseruatiue against all their infections. All this is well, quoth I: but I pray you sir tell mee this: I see a great company descending the hill as it were, some with crownes on their heads, seeming to exult and reioyce, and others without crownes looking like despayring men, with their heads and legges all bruised, and diuers women seeme to detaine them: what are these? They that weare crownes, are the adopted sons of instruction,
               
and reioyce at their adoption. The other, are some of them reiected by her, and so fallne into miserable estate: others, beeing weakened by Sloath, when they had gotten vp as farre as Tolerance, turned back againe, and so sell a wandring they knew not whether. But what are the women that follow them? There is Sorrowe, Trouble, Desperation, Ignominy, and Ignorance. Why then belike all the mischieues that may bee, doe follow them at the heeles. So they do, and when they come back in
                  •
               o the first inclosure, vnto Luxury, and Incontinence, they lay all the

blame on them-selues, and fall a cursing Instruction, and al that are in the way to her, as wretches, &amp; vnfortunate fooles, that leaue the tract that these now do tread, and the pleasures of the first enclosure, to goe seeke had I wist and hunt out a course of such vnhappinesse, refusing to stay and share with them in their delightfull goods. And what are their goods? Shall I tell you in a word? Luxury and Incontinence. For like vnto beasts, they are all for the belly, and imagine the filling of that the full fruite of all their expected good.
            
               But what call you the other women that come downe there, laughing and making semblance of mirth? They are Opinions: they carry men vppe vnto Instuction, and when they haue done, come backe, and tell the rest how gratiously those they presented were receiued, and how they are now in state of blessednesse. Why but doe these Opinions goe in vnto the vertues? Oh no: it is altogether vnlawfull for Opinion to come in the sight of knowledge, they doe onely deliuer the men ouer vnto Instruction, whom shee receiuing, they

goe their waies to fetch more, as shippes do, that hauing vnladed their fraught make presently forth for a new voiage, taking in other commodities. In truth sir, your comparison is passing good, quoth I but you told vs not yet what it is that Liues Genius sayth vnto those that are to enter the course of life. Hee biddeth them bee of good cheere, quoth hee: and bee you of good cheere also, for I will not keepe a letter of the exposition frō you: we thanke you most humbly sir, sayd we all. Then hee, reaching forth

his staffe againe, pointed vp, saying, see you that blind woman vpon the round stone there, whom euen now I told you hight Fortune? Yes. The Genius bids them, neuer to giue credence vnto her, neuer to imagine any solidity in her bounties, neuer to hold her gifts as your proper goods: for that when shee list, shee will take them from one, &amp; bestow them on another, magure all contradiction, it is her ordinarye practise. And therefore hee warneth them, not to delight in her beneuolence, nor to greeue at her frowardnesse: Neuer

to bee conquered either by her curstnesse or her curesies, to giue her neither praises nor curses, seeing shee doth nothing with discretion, but hurleth all about at six and seauen, as I told you already. Therefore doth this Genius bid vs neuer wonder at her exploits, nor play the badde borrowers to count another mans mony our owne, and to bee offended, and hold our selfe iniured, if it be demanded againe: forgetting that our credite lent vs it, vpon condition to haue it restored without contention.
            Thus (saith this Genius) must

we stand affected to the benefits of fortune, and to remember well, that it is one of her old trickes to giue, and take againe, and then to giue one farre more, and presently to take away all euery iot, both what shee gaue last, and what she left before. He bids vs therfore take hir gifts, &amp; hauing them, make hast with them to that firme, and constant kinde of bounty: VVhich is that? That which Instruction giueth to those that come safe to her Tower to aske it. And what giueth shee? See giueth the True knowledge of profitable

thinges, a guift of vnchangeable goodnesse and security. To her therfore hee wils them all to make hast, and when they come to Luxury, and Incontinence, the two women afore-named, to passe by them speedily, and stoppe the eares vnto their inueyg
                  •
               ed perswasions, and so to hasten on vntill they come vnto False Instruction. There hee aduiseth them to make a little stay, and take what they like of her for their Viaticum, the rest of their iourney. And then to scowre away with all speede vnto the Pallace of True Instruction.
               
This is the charge that the Genius of life layeth vppon all that are vppon enterance into the first enclosure: Hee that eyther refuseth it, or misaplyeth it, comes home by vnhappinesse and ruine. This mine honest friendes is the exposition of this Table: If you would bee further satisfied in any thing else, propound it, and I will resolue you. Gramercy, curteous sir. I pray you then what is it that their Genius wisheth them to take at the station of False Inctruction? Such things as they shall neede. And

what bee those? Letters, Languages and Disciplines which Plato called the bridles of youth, keeping them out of worse imployments.
            Must hee that will passe to True Instruction needes take these heere, or may hee lette them alone if hee please? Hee need not vnlesse hee list: They are conuenient, but wholy impertinent to vertue.
            No? are they not necessary for the bettering of our vnderstandings? Yes, but our goodnesse may haue increase without

them, yet are they not altogether vn-vsefull. For we may heare a doctrine reade by another, and yet it were not amisse if wee could reade it in the language our selues, then wee benefit by his reading neuerthelesse: so that one may bee without these disciplines, well enough. I but are not these that vnderstand the artes of a better hability to haue goodnesse infused into them, then others that want those disciplines? No, how should that bee, quoth hee, when they are as badly conceited of the true nature of

good and euill, and as black with the pitchy touch of vitiousnesse, as others that vnderstand nothing? It is an easiy thing for one to bee a deepe scholler, and a maister of all the disciplines, and yet bee as prone to drunkenesse, intemperance, avarice, iniury, treachery, yea and madnesse, as he that neuer sawe the in-side of a schoole-house. There are plenty of those examples, wee neede not goe farre to fetch them. And therfore what prerogatiue hath learning in the reformation of a mans exorbitances? Truely none

quoth I, if things goe thus. But why then are those schollers in the second enclosure, as nearer neighbours to true Instruction then the rest?
            Ablasse, saith hee, what good gette they by that; When wee see often that diuers passe out of the first enclosure, from Incontinence and the other vices, vnto true Instruction without once resting amongst those Disciplinarians? What man then can avouch their estate better because of their place? They are either more dull, or more idle then

others? Why sayd I, how is that? Because, saith hee, though those of the second enclosure were cleare from all faults else, yet this alone stickes by them for euer, To professe to know that, Whereof they are vtterly ignorant: which conceite of themselues, maketh them farre more slacke in the quest of true Instruction.
            
            Againe, doe you not see how the Opinions come flocking out of the first enclosure vnto them? These are the causes why their estate is not an haire better then the others, vnless
                  •
               
               
               Repentance and they fall once acquainted, and that they bee veryly perswaded that they dwell not with True Instruction, but with her counterfeit, which draweth them into errors, and so stoppeth all the meanes of their reformation and passage to security. Wherefore strangers, quoth hee, vnlesse you take this course, and beate this discourse of mine ouer and ouer, vntill you haue gotten the habite thereof (to which ende you must continue an often reuolution thereof in your meditation, and make it your thoughts principall

practise) you shall neuer make vse of any word that you haue heard: Sir, wee will doe our best endeuours. But I pray resolue vs this: Why are not those things worthy the name of goods which Fortune giueth vnto mans vse? as life, health, ritches, honours, children, conquests, and such other her bounties: and why are not their contraries euills? this assertiō seemeth strange and incredible vnto vs. Wel quoth hee, be sure then that you answer directly vnto that I shall demand. I will, quoth I: whether is it good for him that is an euill liuer,

to liue, at all or no. It is not good I thinke (quoth I) for him to liue, but rather euil. How then can life (saith he) bee good at all, if it bee euill for him? Because (quoth I) as to the badde liuer, life is badde, so to the good liuer, life is good. So then, you hold life both good and badde. That I doe sayd I. O beware of an absurdity, (quoth hee.) It is impossible for one thing to bee good and euill. For so it should bee both profitable and hurtfull, and likewise alwaies, both to bee affected and auoyded, and that both at

one time. This is an absurdity indeed, quoth I. But if hee that liueth badly, haue a badnesse by liuing so, how can life but bee badde vnto that man? I but quoth hee, it is one thing to liue, and another to liue badly. That is true quoth I. So then life in it selfe is not bad. For if it were so, it would bee so to the best liues as well as the worst: For all should haue a life that should be a badnes in itself. You say true. VVell then life beeing communicated, both to the good liues &amp; the euil, to liue, of it selfe, is neither good nor euill, no more

then cutting or burning is, both which are good in some diseases, but hurtfull vnto all sound bodies. So is this life: and therefore propose this to yourselfe: whether had you rather liue badly, or die honourably? The latter should be my choyce, quoth I. So then, quoth he, death in it selfe is no badde thing belike: for it is often times to bee preferred before life. Most true. Well then, sicknes &amp; health, haue one and the same respect. For occasion may so fal out, that it befitteth not the sicke man to recouer. It may be so. Good, waigh ritches

then in the same ballance. Suppose that which is often seene: A man hath great wealth, and applyeth it to no good vse: Many such there are. Do not his ritches then helpe his beatitude any way? I think not, because of his own badnes. VVhy then very well, it is not wealth, but wise Instruction that maketh a man happy. Surely so it seemes. How then can ritches be good, when they haue no power to better their possessors? They cannot indeed. VVel, it is befitting then that some should not bee rich at all, because they are ignorant of the true

vse of ritches. Nay I am of your mind in that. How then can that be any way pertaining to goodnesse, which must bee often times withheld from the vse of diuers persons, so that he yt can vse wealth, as wealth should be vsed, may liue well, and hee that cannot must needes breake downe his owne quiet? you strike on truth in all things, sir. Lastly (quoth he) it is the esteeme of those for goods, or the contempt of them as euils, that molesteth and offendeth the cogitations of men, prizing them as thinges of such excellent worth, and the onely conducts

vnto the Court of happinesse and this maketh thē vndergo all actions, euen of how wicked a front soeuer, onely for the attaynment of these glosses. These accidents attend on all such admirers of externall shewes, because theirdull vnderstandings can no way penetrate into the natures of thinges truly good, they are so graueled in the quick-sands of erroneous Ignorance.
