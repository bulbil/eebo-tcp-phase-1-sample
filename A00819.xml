            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

that vnder the like fauour of your

               The ſecond of the Kings the fift Chapter.
               
                  13 BVt this ſeruants came, and ſpake vnto
him, &amp; ſaid, Father, if the Prophet had
cōmāded thee a great thing, woldeſt thou
not haue done it? how much rather then,
when he ſaith to thee, Waſh &amp; be cleane?
                  14 Then went he downe and waſhed himſelfe
ſeuen times in Iorden, according to
the ſaying of the man of God: and his
fleſh came againe, like vnto the fleſh of
a little child, and he was cleane.
                  15 And he returned againe to the man of
God, he, and all his companie, and came
and ſtood before him &amp; ſaid, Behold now
I know that there is no God in all the
world, but in Iſrael: now therefore I pray
thee take a reward of thy ſeruant.
                  16 But he ſaid, As the Lord liueth (before
whom I ſtand) I will not receiue it. And
he would haue conſtrained him to receiue
it, but he refuſed.
               
            
            
               HAuing elſwhere of late (right
Honourable) conſidered of
this Chapter to this place,
I haue thought good to goe
forward with thus much
more of it at this time, hoping

it ſhall not be iudged vnfit for this place,
and theſe dayes wherein we liue. The
words read as we ſée, are parcell of the
ſtorie of Naman the Aſſyrian, a ſtorie ſo wel
knowne vnto vs, that I ſhall not néede to
make any lōg reherſal of it. In few words
for order ſake thus much. Naman was a
mightie man and verie honourable in
the Court of the king of Aſſyria, and euen
with the king him ſelfe verie highly eſtéemed.
The reaſon is alledged in the ſtorie,
namely,
                  
                     ••
                  delitie to 
                     •
                  rinces and 
                     •
                  ountrey, a 
                     •
                  auſe of ho
                  
                     •
                  our: trea
                  
                     •
                  herie of cō
                  
                  
                     •
                  uſion. becauſe by his hand the Lord had
deliuered the kingdome from great danger:
thereby the ſpirit of God teaching vs, that
there is not in this world a more iuſt cauſe
of honorable regard, and moſt high accompt
to be had and made of a man, not only with
people but euen with Prince, then faithful
loue and fruteful ſeruice to king and countrie:
as the contrarie is moſt worthy alſo
of al hatred,Leproſie. ſhame, and confuſion. But amidſt
al this honor (ſaith the ſtorie) Naman
was a Leaper, an vgly and grieuous
diſeaſe we all know, euen in a poore man,
but in one of ſuch place far more grieuous.Great men haue their humblings.
We learne and ſée by it how often God
thinketh it good to ſeaſon the pleaſures and
glorie that otherwiſe he voutſafeth great

men in this world with ſome humblings &amp;
chaſtiſements, either maladies in bodie, or
miſeries in minde, from which yet after
triall and exerciſe of them to his pleaſure,
he is able to releaſe them as he did here
Naman, if it ſhalbe good for them. The ſtorie
againe telleth vs, there was dwelling
with Namans wife an Iſraelitiſh maid, taken
by ye Aſſyrians as they ſcouted abroad
and placed with her: This maide ſéeing her
Lord and maſter his wofull eſtate, like an
honeſt ſeruant pitied it, and wiſhed that
her Lord were with the Prophet in her
countrie, doubtleſſe he would heale him.
The words of the maide were brought to
Namans hearing, he yéelded to the wiſh, &amp;
intendeth a iourney to ye Prophet, acquainteth
the king his maſter with his deſire,
who not only gaue him leaue, but writ alſo
his honourable letters to the king of Iſrael
in his behalfe: which letters were
wonderfully miſtaken when they were
read, as if a quarrel by thē ſhould be ſought
againſt him, ſo that he rent his clothes for
griefe and anger at theſe letters. The prophet
Eliſha hearing of this behauiour in the
king, ſent word to him to ſend Naman to
him, and he ſhould know that there was a

Prophet in Iſrael. Vpon which meſſage
Naman came to him, &amp; receiued this direction,
that he ſhould go waſh ſeuen times in
Iorden, and he ſhould be whole. But ſo far
was he from ioying to heare of health after
this ſort, yt he tooke it to be a méere mockery
of him, and brake out into words, that he
looked the Prophet ſhould haue come forth
to him, and haue laid his hands on him,
prayed for him, and ſo haue healed him, as
for water and waſhing are not Abanah &amp;
Pharpar (ſaith he) riuers of Damaſcus as
good as the waters of Iſrael, &amp;c. In which
chafe and choller his ſeruants ſpake vnto
him as we haue now heard. Father (ſay
they) if the Prophet had commanded thee
a great thing, wouldſt thou not haue done
it? how much more this that he ſaith, waſh
and be cleane, &amp;c. This is the ſtorie.
            Now for the words read, if we marke
them, they offer vnto our conſideration
foure things.
            
               1 First the ſpeech of the ſeruants to their
Lord.
               2 Secondly, his yeelding thereunto.
               3 Thirdly, the fruit of his obedience, health.
               4 Lastly, his thankefulneſſe when he was
healed▪
               
            
            
               
The ſpéech of the ſeruants againe, hath
in it to be obſerued:
            
               The ground from whence it came.
               The manner of it.
               The matter of it.
            
            His yéelding hath in it,
            
               To whom he yeeldeth: euen to his ſeruants.
               In what ſort: readily, without check or ſnub.
            
            The fruit or effect, being his health, hath
in it,
            
               How it was obtained, to wit, by waſhing in
Iorden.
               How many times: ſeuen times.
            
            His thankfulnes laſtly hath in it,
            
               To whom, to wit, to

                     God.
                     The Prophet,
                  
               
               In what ſort, vehemently, not only formally.
            
            Concerning the firſt, the ſpeach of the
ſeruants, and therein firſt the ground from
whence it came, what was it, but a louing,
a true, a dutifull, and an affectionate heart
to the good of their maſter. This made them
ſpeake,Faithfulnes in ſeruants euer bleſſed this made them venture, this made
thē bold to perſwade with him as they did:

A thing that euer God required in ſeruants,

                  ph. 6. 5. &amp;c. 
               obay them that
are your maſters with feare and trembling,
that is, with carefull reuerence in ſinglenes
of your heart, as vnto Chriſt. Not with eye
ſeruice as men pleaſers, but as ſeruants of
Chriſt, doing the wil of God from the heart.
With good will ſeruing the Lord and not
men, and know yee, that whatſoeuer good
thing any man doth, that ſame ſhall he receiue
of the Lord, whether he be bond or
free.
               Gen. 24. With what remembrance is the ſeruant
of Abraham regiſtred in the booke of
God for his faithfulnes and loue to his maſter,
that hauing receiued in charge to goe
ſéeke a fit match for his maſters ſonne amongſt
his owne kinred, from whom he
was then farre ſeperate by the commandement
of God, that willed him to remooue as
he did, the ſeruaunt fell vpon his knées to
the Lord for direction, euerie way in that
buſineſſe to his maſters good: would not
eate nor drinke when he came to the place,
till he ſaw how he ſhould ſpéede, &amp;c. How
alſo is Iacob ſpoken of,Gen. 29. as true a ſeruant

as euer man had?Gen. 39. How Ioſeph, how many
moe for their true hearts and faithfull ſeruice
to their maſters? Therefore deare and
precious (I ſay) was euer this diſpoſition
in ſeruants that here we ſée in Namans ſeruants
to day: Loue to maſter, is loue to
God, ſeruice to maſter is ſeruice to God, &amp;
ſo reputed, eſtéemed, and bleſſed of God.
Now if we ſhould aſke by what meanes
this loue was wrought in the ſeruants to
their maſter, certainly (with great probabilitie
we may ſay) it was by the honourable
vſage of them by their maſter, for the
whole ſtorie ſpeaketh of Naman as of a verie
honourable minded man to all ſorts. A
remembrance that way againe to maſters,Honorable fauour and good vſage in maiſters of ſeruants.
to regard their poore ſeruants with comfort
and fauour, as ſhalbe fit, if they wil poſſeſſe
their hearts, as they owne their bodies for
their times. For this is it yt pearceth with
a ſugred ſwéetnes, euen to the reines of a
man, and maketh him thinke no toile of bodie
or braine too much for ſo good a maſter.
Example Ioſeph,
               Gen. 39. 8. 9. who inflamed in heart
with his maſters moſt honourable fauours
to him, in putting him ſo in truſt that he
knew not what he had vnder his hand, defied
all wickednes, temptations, and baits

againſt him, whatſoeuer they might gaine
him in the world.

                  ardnes in 
                     •
                  aſters. The cōtrarie in a maſter
woūdeth the heart and the verie ſoule of a
true ſeruāt whē he ſéeth it: Example Iacob,
               Gen. 31. 2.
who ſéeing the countenance of Laban changed
vpon him, brake into griefe, bewayled
it to his wiues, and as vtterly diſcouraged
to ſerue any more, purpoſeth a departure,
which to Labans great loſſe he performed.
I know the maſters Poſie is,The maſters Poſie. 
               Deſerue and
then deſire, and but good reaſon that deſert
ſhould go before deſire: but then when deſert
is, and deſire vpon deſert to reléeue

Poſie againe with mourning mind,The ſeruāts Poſie. 
               Fidelis
ſeruus perpetuus aſinus: A good ſeruant and
a perpetual drudge.
               Chapt. 7. 
               Ieſus the ſonne of Syrach
was a wiſe man we al know, and amongſt
many precepts he giueth this as one: Let
thy ſoule loue a good ſeruant,
               A note for al maſters. 
               defraud him
not that beſtoweth himſelfe for thee, neither
leaue him euer a poore man. Neglect of this
hath depriued men of ſuch as were worth
gold, &amp; furniſhed them with ſlipperie ones
in their places, of whom after triall, they
were forced to ſay 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               .Ariſtotle. 
               O friends
I finde no friend; féeling the truth of this.
            
               Cum tot populis ſtipatus eas,
               
                  
In tot populis vix vna fides.
            
            
               Garded thou art with troupes of men, but faith
thou findest ſcarſe in one. Remember here
Naman furniſhed with faithfull ſeruants
towards him, becauſe he was moſt honorable
towards them. Loue in maſter makes
loue in man, except in forme of man he be
a diuell.
            Hauing thus conſidered the ground of
this ſpeach,A terme giuen then &amp; ſince to Magiſtrates and men in authoritie, to teach them with what affectiō they ſhould loue their inferiours, euen as children, &amp; howe inferiours ought to honour them euen as Fathers. Gen. 41 43. let vs next conſider the manner
of it, which as we ſée is modeſt▪ humble, reuerent,
with the title and terme of Father
and no worſe. Thus ſpake men in thoſe
dayes that taſted but of ciuilitie: If more
we would ſée, more we may well ſée in the
23. of Geneſis, where the Sichemites ſpeake
toGen. 23. Num. 12. 11. How good men ſpeake to men of authoritie. 1. Sam. 9. 6. 
               Abraham as to a Prince, Abraham to
them againe with all reuerence. Aron
ſpeaketh to Moſes his owne brother with
title of Lord, Let not my Lord be angrie
&amp;c. Sauls ſeruant that went with him to
ſéeke the loſt aſſes ſaith, here dwelleth in
this towne a Seer, an honorable man. And
he that ſpake ſo of the Prophet, would haue
vſed no leſſe reuerence to the Prophet we
may well thinke. The Angel himſelfe to a
man choſen to office, vſeth reuerence and
termes of honour,Iudg 6. 22. God ſaue thée Gedeon
               
thou valiant man. Thus I ſay again ſpake
men in thoſe dayes to men in authoritie.
But alas the change now, when we rime
in verſe, raile in proſe, and ſinne in both,
againſt God and his choſen inſtrumentes
here on earth, moſt fearefully. We ruffell
with them as Corah and his company did
with Moſes and Aron, proudly and malitiouſly
telling them that they take too much
vpon them, neuer remembring the dreadfull
iudgement that befell thoſe men for
ſuch behauiour,Num. 26. 10. nor that which is more,
that it is ſaid expreſly in the text, that it
was done in ſignum for a ſigne,
                to wit, of
that which ſhall befall firſt or laſt, one way
or other, to all thoſe that euer ſhould do the
like: For Sequitur ſuperbos vltor a tergo
Deus, The plague of God followeth the proud
ſtomake euen at the heeles:
                And moſt notable
is it that Chryſoſtom hath to this purpoſe,
when he ſaith,Humilitie. 
               Eſto, multum edifices, habeas
elemoſynas, ieiunia, preces, virtutes omnes,
omnia iſta prophana ſunt, impura, abominabilia
ſine humilitate. Let it be that thou
edifiest much, hast almes deeds, fastings, prayers,
and all vertues, if thy hart be proud, malitious,
enuious against thy ſuperiours, and void
of humilitie; certainly all theſe are prophane,

impure and abominable in thee.
                The verie
ſame iudgement had Auſten when he ſaid,
if he were aſked what was the chiefe thing
in pietie and religion, and what the ſecond,
and what the third; he would anſwere to
all, and that all in al were humilitie, as the
Rhetorician ſaid, pronunciation was in
eloquence.Modeſt ſpeech ſhall not be vnbleſſed. Looke we then often, euen
with a religious eye at this modeſtie and
reuerēce in Namans ſeruants, and be ſure
what the wiſedome of God hath not paſſed
vnnoted in them, he wil not paſſe ouer vnbleſſed
in vs, if we haue it.Thinke of this. He that tuneth
an inſtrument, and will haſtely hoyſt a
ſtring, may happely ſooner breake it then
tune it, but by milde and gentle ſtrayning,
he may bring it to a pitch that ſhall fit his
purpoſe. Thus of the manner alſo of their
ſpéech.
            The third thing in their ſpéech is the
matter of it,The matter of the ſeruants ſpeech which as we all ſée is a plaine
perſwaſion of their Lord &amp; maſter, to that
thing that diſliked him, that he was offended
with, and could not abide to heare of at
the Prophets owne mouth. And why perſwade
they thus? Surely becauſe it tended
to his good, therefore they aduenture to
ſpeake. Then theſe ſeruants ſoothed not

their Lord in his wrong humour,
                  
                     •
                  othing 
                     ••
                  ruants. they
played not as the reflection of the face doth
in the glaſſe, euer performing that ſame
geſture that we vſe, &amp; no other. In a word,
they flattered not either for fauor or feare,
but with duetie ſpake truely to their maſters
good, though his preſent humour carries
him then to a contrary courſe. O glaſſe
of glaſſes for all men to looke in with great
profite,A glaſſe for 
                     •
                  ll ſeruants. but eſpecially ſuch as in this place
now behold and ſée it. For héere, héere are
they, who if they were dealt withall truely
and dutifully, would certainly avoid what
many times they do with great hurt, either
to themſelues or others. And where as the
common ſaying feareth many that wiſh
the beſt: to wit, Veritas odium parit, obſequium
amicos, Truth gets hatred, and flatterie,
friends:
                without doubt it is not ſo euer,Good men not offended with truth.
but quite contrarie with graue, wiſe, and
good men. My warrant is not onely experience,
which yet is a ſure teacher, but the
expreſſe word of God,Prou

                  .23. that ſaith, he that rebuketh
a man ſhal finde more fauour at the
laſt,Flatterie. then he that flattereth with the tongue.
The venom of flatterie, and the bane that
is brought by ſmoothing tongues, no words
can vtter, no thoughts of hearts abhor ſufficiently.

What monſters of men were
thoſe ſeruants of Abſolon?
               2. Sam. 13. 29▪
                who to content
their maſters wicked humour ſlew ye kings
ſonne, &amp; their maſters brother in the midſt
of the banquet that was made for ſuch a
purpoſe. What a wound to the kingdome
gaue thoſe flattering young counſellers,2. Chro. 10. 10.
when with their ſmoothing the king in his
vaine of youth, and croſſing ye aduiſe of the
old and prudent counſailers, at one blow
they cut from the kingdome, of twelue
tribes, ten? What an vgly vice in Vriah
the Prieſt was it to follow the kings humour,2. Kin. 16. 11
and make an altar expreſly againſt
the word and will of God? Many ſuch filthy
flatterers with their harmes could I remember
if néedfull it were, theſe not ſuffiſing.
Not without cauſe therefore ſaid Antiſthenes
once,Antiſthenes that it was better to fall in

amongst flatterers,
                for rauens féed but vpon
the dead, flatterers vpon the liuing, rauens
eate the bodie, flatterers deuour the mind,
and what vertue ſo euer might be in the
ſame. Who haſtened as it were, and euen
pulled out of God his hand that fearefull
plague and iudgement vpon Herod, to be
ſmitten with the Angel of God ſodainly,

and eaten with lice, but thoſe ſmiling ſmothers
that cried the voice of God and not of
man.Act. 12. 22. This filthy flatterie maketh a Welch
Prouerb that we haue in Wales true,Tre feth ſee a noth y dde

it is hard to know thrée things, an oke, a
day, and a man: An oke for his priuie windſhakes
that may be within, ſéeme it neuer
ſo faire without: a day for his variableneſſe
of wether, and accidents that
fall therein, and a man for his hollow hart
when his words are ſofter then oile, and
moſt comfortable: But let this ſinne go to
hell, whither it will carrie all that vſe it
without repentance, and let vs marke the
vertue of theſe ſeruants of Naman yt were
ſo far from it. They are dead, and yet liue
for dealing plainly with duetie for their
maſters good, and hating to ſooth him to his
harme, and liue they ſhall with God aſſuredly
that euer vſe it.
            The reaſon of their perſwaſion is an argument
drawne from the greater to the
leſſe.The reaſon of the ſeruants. 
               If the Prophet (ſay they) had commaunded
thee a great thing, wouldſt thou
not haue done it? then much more willingly
ſhould this ſmall thing be performed.
               A maiori.
The grounds of their Antecedent are two:why a great thing ſhould be done if cōmanded
The calling of the bidder, a Prophet, (therfore

they ſay if the Prophet,
               The calling of the bidder. with an emphaſis
in the title and name) and the end of
the thing bidden to attainment of health,
and deliuerance from ſo grieuous a diſeaſe:
either of which, but much more both togither,
were a ſufficient reaſon to make a mā
do a great thing, if it had béene commanded.
Being as much in effect and ſenſe, as
if they ſhould haue ſaid,Miniſters words to be regarded for their calling ſir his calling firſt
is reuerent and high, not to be deſpiſed or
lightly regarded; He is a Prophet, the miniſter
of God, by whom God hath ſhewed
his power greatly, as we haue heard, and
therefore his words muſt be of weight, and
his direction followed, though he had inioyned
a great matter. Secondly what he willeth,
tendeth to your health, and to no worſe
effect: for he ſaith Waſh and be cleane. Now
for a mans health verie great things are to
be indured, eſpecially if his griefe be great.
Therefore, as wel for his calling that willeth,
as for the fruite of the thing willed,
this counſel of the Prophet ſhould willingly
and readily be imbraced and followed.
This is the perſwaſion in ſubſtance, &amp; the
grounds they build vpon in ye ſame. A verie
plaine, a verie true, and a verie profitable
perſwaſion in whole and in part: Apply it

to our ſelues and it may thus auaile vs.
            Do Namans ſeruants ſéeme to regard
the calling of the Prophet,Application. and to think his
words may not be deſpiſed without great
folly? Alas what knew they concerning
Gods Prophets &amp; miniſters, to that which
we know this day and this houre? We
know the Lord now ſpeaketh not, nor buildeth
his church in this world by his owne
voyce in his owne perſon,Epheſ. 4. 11. but he hath giuen
ſome Prophets, ſome Apoſtles, ſome Euangeliſts,
ſome Paſtors and teachers for the
repairing of the ſaincts, for the worke of the
miniſterie, and for the edification of the bodie
of Chriſt, till we all meete togither in
the vnitie of faith vnto a perfect man, &amp;c.
And by theſe he teacheth, by theſe he conuinceth,
by theſe he correcteth and inſtructeth
vnto righteouſnes.
               2. Tim. 3. 16. To theſe we know he
hath ſaid,Matth. 28. 19 
               Go into all the world and teach,
and I will be with you. We know he hath
ſaid, He that heareth you heareth me, and
he that deſpiſeth you deſpiſeth me,
               Contempt of miniſters contempt of God. euen me
my ſelfe and mine owne perſon.1. Sam. 8. 7. 
               Non reiecerunt
te, ſed reiecerunt me (ſaid God to Samuel.)
They haue not cast thee away, but haue
cast me away:
                And it is true, in the contēpt
of any mans miniſterie duely and truely

vſed. None of theſe things (as we know
them) knew Namans ſeruants, and yet
they reuerenced, they regarded, and perſwaded
their Lord and maſter to regard,
&amp; feared a contempt of ſuch a mans words.
What iudges in the dreadfull and iudging
day of God ſhall they then be againſt vs,
that knowing what we know, and conuinced
in our conſciences with the trueth of
that we heare, yet fearefully deſpiſe both
ſpéech and ſpeaker, both calling and counſell:
and not onely ſo our ſelues, but either
by example, or by perſwaſion, or by both,
indeuour to effect ye ſame in others? A word
is enough to men wiſe and learned: God
will not indure diſdaine and ſcorne for euer.
His owne mouth hath ſaid, he indureth
it when his meſſengers indure it. His own
hand will plague it therefore if he be God,
vnleſſe we leaue it. Cyprian ſaid well,Lib. 4. Epi. 
                     •
                  
                and
to this end moſt truely, Qui non credit
Chriſto Sacerdotem agenti, credet tandem
vindicanti. He that beleeueth not Christ whē
he doth the office of a minister, ſhall beleeue
him to his wo, whē he doth the office of a iudge.
               
How doth Chriſt the office of a miniſter,
but in, and by thoſe, that be our miniſters?
beléeue not them then, beléeue not Chriſt,

and ſo receiue indgement for contempt of
Chriſt.
            Secondly, was the good of bodie (the releaſe
from a fleſhly leaproſie) ſuch a matter
in theſe ſeruants eyes,The ende of 
                     •
                  ur counſell &amp; preaching farre better 
                     •
                  hen the Prophets now to Naman. that for it euē great
things were to be obeyed and done? What
thinke we then of good for bodie and ſoule,
of deliuerance from ſpirituall leaproſie of
ſoule that infecteth to death eternal, both of
bodie and ſoule? ſhould not great things be
indured for that, ſhould not hard things be
obeyed and followed for that? Such is the
fruite of our miniſterie, and ſuch is the effect
of our perſwaſions if they be receiued.
Hoc fac &amp; viue, This do and thou ſhalt liue.
               
In Chriſt and by Chriſt we do it when we
beléeue and practiſe as we are taught and
God inableth. And thus of the matter of the
ſeruants ſpéech.
            The ſecond generall head was the obedience
of Naman to the counſell:Namans obedience. wherein
we may obſerue firſt, whom he yéeldeth vnto,
and followeth. Surely his owne ſeruants,
men, for place ſo farre inferiour to
him, as ſeruants to ſuch noble and honorable
maſters be, yet their counſell he imbraceth,
and their aduiſe, though contrarie to
his liking, he will not reiect. How true then

do we ſée it to be?Wiſe men regard not euer who ſpeaketh, but what it ſpoken. that graue and wiſe men
do not regard ſo much who ſpeaketh, as
what is ſpoken, knowing that Saepe etiam
eſt holitor valde opportuna locutus. The
poore gardner many times ſpeaketh greatly to
purpoſe. Saepe ſub ſordido paliolo latet ſapientia.
Often vnder a poore cloke lyeth wiſedome
ſhrowded and hidden.
                Daungerous therefore
it is,Dangerous to pin our ſelues to titles of men. and preiudiciall to good diſcretion, to
tye our ſelues to titles and places of men
that ſhall counſell vs, as willing to regard
nothing, except it procéed from ſome man
of note, graced with ſome worldly place
and title of dignitie in the world: for Naman
we ſée was healed, &amp; receiued a great
good by yéelding to his poore ſeruants, when
they ſpake well and to good effect. And we
know God himſelfe tieth not his wiſedome
euer to men of greateſt note for worldly
place,1. Cor. 1. but hath often choſen the fooliſh
things of the world to confirme the wiſe,
and the weake things of the world, to confound
the mightie things. And vile things
of the world, and things which are deſpiſed
hath God choſen, and things which are not,
to bring to nought things that are, That no
fleſh ſhould reioyce in his preſence.
            
            
               Optimus ille quidem, qui paret recta monenti:
               
The best man therefore is he, that imbraceth
good counſell, be he neuer ſo meane an
instrument from whom it commeth.
            Next we obſerue how readily and willingly
Naman doth it,Good counſel to be followed readily without checks. making no replie to
the contrarie, giuing them no checke, no
ſnub, no rebuke for intermedling with his
matters. Certainly a great vertue and a
verie honorable minde in him, to the checke
of all thoſe that rate and reuile, beat downe
and diſgrace at the firſt, ſuch as perhaps after
they follow, though not ſeeming ſo to
doe. Surely he ſpake it moderately that
ſpake it, and it is moſt worthy marking.
Si merito reprehenderit quis, ſcito quia profuit,
ſi immerito, ſcito quia prodeſſe voluit.
If a man rebuke a man and croſſe his mind with
ſome perſwaſion, if there be cauſe of that perſwaſion,
then hath he profited thee, if there be no
cauſe, yet was his heart &amp; mind to profite thee,
and that is to be regarded and accepted without
any vnkind checke euer.
               
            
            3 And his fleſh came againe like the fleſh
of a young child, and he was cleane. This
is the frute that followed his obedience,The fruit of Namans obedience. he
was healed. But you will ſay, Did the water
of Iordan heale him? No, no more thē
the clay and ſpittle that our Sauiour vſed

gaue ſight.God healed not the water. But there then that, and now
here this was the meanes that it pleaſed
God to vſe, he him ſelfe both there and here
healing by his diuine power and might. If
we aſke againe,Why he waſhed 7. time▪
                why ſeuen times he waſhed,
&amp; was not healed with once or twiſe
waſhing? The anſwer may be this, that as
well at once as after ſeuen times waſhing
God could haue healed him, if it had pleaſed
him, and without any waſhing at all if he
would, for neither the waſhing nor the nū
               ber
auayled anie thing to his health: but
the one vſed, becauſe ſo it pleaſed God, who
vſeth outward things as he pleaſeth, and
leaueth them alſo when he will, and the
number of times vſed onely for exerciſe of
his faith and obedience. As he brought the
children of Iſrael to the land of Canaan after
many years triall, which he could haue
giuen farre ſooner if he would. He could by
and by haue releaſed Ioſeph frō his wrongfull
impriſonment if he would, yet he let
him alone a long time, and all to ſchoole
him. Dauid he could haue brought to the
kingdome, with halfe the difficultie that he
did if he would, &amp; haue deliuered alſo Daniel
and the thrée children, before euer they
had come into ſuch daunger: but thus he

thought good to exerciſe their faith, patience
and hope, that much more they might ſhine
hauing thus bene tryed. And this is a note
for all wearie ſuters in this place to take
with them.Wearie ſu
                  
                     •
                  ers comfort If it pleaſed God he could effect
your deſires, and diſpatch you away in a
day, but then ſhould not you know, what
perhaps thus you learne, neither inward
faith receiue ſuch frutefull exerciſe, as thus
it doth, looking to God, hoping in God, and
reſting vpon God, to receiue frō him what
ſhall be beſt, and in ſuch time and ſpace as
ſhall be beſt. Yet may I not ſay that your
profiting any way by your delayes may be
a iuſt excuſe to them, that without any néed
are cauſes of the ſame. For ſurely the Lord
would haue all honeſt ſutes with conuenient
ſpéede euer diſpatched: and that made
Moſes firſt ſit him ſelfe from morning to
night, and after to chuſe others his coadiutors
in that buſineſſe, that men might more
quickly and eaſily be reléeued. And thus
much briefly of Namans healing.
            The fourth and laſt thing is his thankfulnes

conſidered what he had béene, and what he

ſwéete féeling into praiſe and prayer, ſaying:Gen. 32. 10.

God of my father Iſaac, &amp;c. I am not worthy
of the leaſt of all the mercies, and of all

bands with Iacob, beginning but with
their ſtaffe, as thankfull to the giuer as Iacob
was.

elſe, that was not named: to wit, fauour
of great perſonages and long life. Which
when the gods ſaw, to reward vnthankfulneſſe
with a condigne puniſhment, they
chaunged their giftes, and he that ſaid he
would giue beautie, gaue the child when it

was borne the head of an ape, he that ſaid
he would giue ſtrength, gaue it for hands
gooſe féete, and for armes gooſe legges: the
third that ſaid he would giue riches, Dedit
excoriatum, gaue it ſo bare that it had not
ſo much as any ſkin vpon it. Thus was
vnthankfulnes puniſhed, and be if ſtorie
or fable, or whatſoeuer, the drift of it is
Gods truth, as true as God, that vnthankfulnes
is odious to the Lord. Naman therefore
a bleſſed man that had ſuch a féeling
heart of Gods goodnes towards him.
            But was he onely thankful?Naman with an edge thankfull, &amp; ſo ought we. No (I ſay)
but with an edge he was thankfull, &amp; that
alſo is to be noted. His words haue an emphaſis

no God, no God, but the God of Iſrael: I wil

ſay, the truth of God ſaith, thankfulnes to
God is to be perfourmed, not in ſhew, but
in truth: not for forme, but with féeling,
as here did Naman. For what is that fire
that the Lord Ieſus baptizeth with all,Matth. 3. is it
colder then water?Act. 2. Why came the holy
ghoſt vpon the Apoſtles like tongues of
fire? Surely theſe places tell vs that heat
in heart, and heat in tongue is wherſoeuer
Gods ſpirite ruleth: and if where there is
ſome warmth, that is a lukewarmnes,Reuel. 3. yet
there the Lord threatneth deſtruction and
confuſion: ſaying, He will vomit ſuch out
of his mouth: how much more where there
is none at all? no not euen ſo much as a
lukewarmnes, but onely a ſéeming, to ſooth
the world withall, and no more. Far therefore

paradox, and in ſtéede thereof this example

might we ſomewhat leſſen the cauſe, and
drie vp the fountaine from whence ſpringeth
ingratitude now named towards Magiſtrates
and Miniſters, and make vs crie,
as thankfully as euer the Grecians did, of

whom I haue ſpoken, or as Naman the Aſſyrian
doth, whom now we intreat of. God
guide vs and direct vs in his mercie.
            The heat I ſaid of Namans thankfulnes

                which god his wiſdome
hath not concealed, but purpoſely noted in
this (He would haue compelled him.) It
affoordeth vs this doctrine, that it is not
enough when we haue receiued a benefite
from men, to vtter a few formall thanks,
or to conceiue a few fine phraſes, but both
man ioyeth in and God himſelfe requireth
a heat, a zeale, an earneſt, faithfull, and
feeling thankſgiuing after God the giuer,
to man the meanes of his mercie towards
vs. Naman had it here in the text, and God
will not conceale it, but vtter it for our
knowledge. The Leaper cleanſed in the
Goſpel, turned backe, fell downe on his
face at Ieſus féete,Luke 16. 17. and with a lowd voyce
gaue him thanks: all words and geſtures
of heat and hartineſſe in this duetie. The
blind man when he had receiued ſight, Followed
Ieſus, and praiſed him: followed him
(ſaith the ſtorie) which was heate, when a
froſen zeale would haue ſlipt away after
a few formall words. What heartie heate
was in Marie for good receiued, when ſhe

lay at his féete, and with teares that came
from a rauiſhed heart waſhed them, and
wiped them with the haires of her head.
Was this an ordinarie thankfulnes, or a
heat in her, honoured by God himſelfe, and
in vs aſſured euer of bleſſing, if we haue it?
Thankfull therefore we ought to be not
onely to God but to men, for ſo was Naman,
and that feruently, not falſely, for ſo
was Naman.
            
            Why the Prophet would not receiue
this offred gift at Namans hands,Why the Prophet refuſed his gift two cauſes
may be coniectured: One, that he might
bréed in Naman a conceipt of difference in
him, and all true Prophets, from falſe diſſemblers,
where of then were many, with
whom all was fiſh that came to net. Another,
that he might hereby occaſion Naman
to thinke of God, as the onely giuer, worker,
and effecter of his health, and not of any
vertue in him (the Prophet) thereunto,
which happely he might haue done, if his
gift had bene receiued.A care of our name. This teacheth vs a
doctrine of care to preſerue our honeſt eſtimation
in the world with all men, as we
may well,Not to rob God of glorie. and not to robbe God of his glorie
by ignorance in men to diſcerne aright,
but the time is gone: The God of mercie

and power giue his word a bleſſing, make
it a ſauour of life vnto life to vs, and let it
neuer be a ſauour of death vnto death: Increaſe
our knowledge, but increaſe our
obedience alſo according to our knowledge,
that we may not onely know what to do,
but do it euerie day, and euerie way more
and more through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
who with the father and the holy ghoſt, be
bleſſed, praiſed, and honoured now
and for euermore,
Amen.
