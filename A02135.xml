            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

vouchſafe to welcome your Scholler-like
Shepherd, with ſuch Vniuerſitie entertainment,
as either the nature of your bounty,

                of his paines: thinking his
day-labour was not altogether lauiſht ſiue linea, if there be
any thing at al in it, that doth olere Atticum in your eſtimate.
I am not ignorant how eloquent our gowned age is grown
of late, ſo that euery Mechanicall mate abhorreth the Engliſh

not extemporall in the inuention of any other meanes

eternitie in the mouth of a Player, I can but ingroſſe
ſome deep-read Schoolemen or Grammarians, who hauing
no more learning in their skull, then will ſerue to take vp a
commoditie, nor Art in their braiue, then was nouriſhed in
a Seruing-mans idleneſſe, will take vpon them to bee the
ironicall Cenſors of all, when God and Poetrie doth know
they are the ſimpleſt of all. To leaue all theſe to the mercy
of their Mother tongue, that feed on nought but the crums
that fall from the

               ranſlators trencher, I come (ſweet friend)
to thy Arcadian Menaphon, whoſe attyre (though not ſo
ſtately, yet comely) doth intitle thee aboue all other, to that
temperatum dicendi genus, which Tully in his Orator termeth
true eloquence. Let other men (as they pleaſe) praiſe the
Mountayne that in ſeuen yeeres bringeth forth a Mouſe, or
the Italianate Pen, that of a packet of pilfris, affoords the
Preſſe a pamphlet or two in an Age, and then in diſguiſed
array vaunts Ouids and Plutarchs plumes as their owne:
but giue mee the man, whoſe extemporall veine in any humour,
will excell our greateſt Art-Maſters deliberate
thoughts, whoſe inuentions quicker then his eye, will challenge
the prowdeſt Rhetorician, to the contention of like
perfection, with like expedition.
            What is he among Students ſo ſimple, that cannot bring
foorth (tanquam aliquando) ſome or other thing ſingular,
ſleeping betwixt euery ſentence? What is not Maroes
twelue yeeres toyle, that ſo famed his twelue Aeneidos? Or
Peter Ramus ſixteene yeeres paines, that ſo praiſed his petty
Logicke? How is it then, our drowping wits ſhould ſo
wonder at an exquiſite line, that was his Maſters day-labour?
Indeede I muſt needs ſay, the deſcending yeeres from
the Philoſophers Athens, haue not beene ſupplied with ſuch
preſent Orators, as were able in any Engliſh veine to be eloquent

of their owne, but either they muſt borrow inuention
of Arioſto, &amp; his countrimen, take vp choice of words by exchange
in Tullies Tuſculans, &amp; the Latine Hiſtoriographers
ſtore-houſes, ſimilitudes, nay whole ſheets, &amp; tractates verbatim,
from the plentie of Plutarch and Plinie: and to conclude,
their whole methode of writing, from the libertie of
Comicall fictions, that haue ſucceeded to our Rhetoricians
by a ſecond imitation; ſo that wel may the Adage, Nil dictum
quod non dictum prius, bee the moſt iudiciall eſtimate of our
latter Writers. But the hunger of our vnſatiate humoriſts,
being ſuch as it is, ready to ſwallow all draffe without difference,
that inſinuates it ſelfe to their ſenſes vnder the name
of delights, imploies ofttimes many thredbare wits, to emptie
their inuention of their Apiſh deuices, and talke moſt ſuperficially
of Policie, as thoſe that neuer ware gowne in the
Vniuerſitie; wherein they reuiue the old ſaid Adage, Sus
Mineruam, and cauſe the wiſer to quippe them with Aſinui
ad lyram. Would Gentlemen and riper iudgements admit
my motion of moderation in a matter of folly, I would
perſwade them to phyſicke their faculties of ſeeing and hearing,
as the Sabaeans doe their dulled ſenſes with ſmelling:
who (as Strabo reporteth) ouer-cloyd with ſuch odoriferous
ſauours as the naturall increaſe of their Country (Balſamum,
Amomum, with Myrrhe and Frankincenſe) ſends forth, refreſh
their noſtrills with the vnſauourie ſent of the pitchy
flame, that Euphrates caſt vp, &amp; the cōiagíous fumes of goats
beards burned: ſo would I haue them, being ſurfeited vnawares
with the ſweet ſaciety of eloquence, which the lauiſh
of our copious language may procure, to vſe the remedie of
contraries, and recreate their rebated wits; not as they did,
with the ſenting of ſlime or Goats beards burned, but with
the ouer-ſeeing of that ſublime dicendi genus, which walkes
abroad for waſte paper in each Seruing-mans pocket, and
the otherwhile pervſing of our Gothamiſts barbariſme; ſo
ſhould the oppoſite compariſon of Puritie, expell the infection
of Abſurditie, and their ouer-racked Rhetoricke, bee
the Ironicall recreation of the Reader.

Poets haue aſpired to ſince his departure, whereto hee did
aſcend, by comparing the Italian with the Engliſh, as Tully

forth, are but drie-brained dolts in compariſon of other countries:

Gower, with ſuch like, that liued vnder the tyrannie of ignorance,
I doe thinke their beſt louers would bee much diſcontented

all their heads, Haile fellow, well met. One thing I am
ſure of, that each of theſe three haue vented their meeters
with as much admiration in Engliſh, as euer the proudeſt Arioſto
did his verſe in Italian.

who cauſing the Oracle to bee read amongſt the diſtreſſed
commons, found the Delphian cenſure more full of doubts
to amaze, then fraught with hope to comfort: thinking rather
that the anger of GOD ſent a peremptory preſage of
ruine, then a probable ambiguitie to applaud any hope of
remedie: yet loth to haue his carefull ſubiects fall into the
balefull Labyrinth of deſhaire, Democles beganne to diſcourſe

were not the conceits of humane reaſon, but the ſucceſſe

blaze, but tooke effect in the dated boſome of the deſtinies:
that Oracles were fortold at the Delphian caue, but were
ſhapte out and fluiſhed in the Counſell houſe. With ſuch
perſwaſiue arguments Democles appealed the diſtreſſed

by Proclamation, that no man ſhould pry into the quiddities

               Menaphon, thy mindes fauours are greater than thy
wealths fortunes, thy thoughts higher than thy birth, and
thy priuate conceit better then thy publique eſteeme. Thou
art a ſhepheard, Menaphon, who in feeding of thy 
                  •
               oike
findeſt out natures ſecrecis, and in 
                  •
               rouenting thy lambes
preiudice, conceiteſt the aſtronomicall motions of the heauens:
holding thy ſheepe-walkes to yeeld as great Philoſophie,
as the ancients diſcourſe in their learned Academies.
Thou counteſt labour as the Indians doe their Chryſocolla,
wherewith they try euery mettall, and thou examine
euery action. Content ſitteth in thy minde as Neptune in
his Sea-throne, who with his trident mare appeaſeth euery
ſtorme. When thou ſeeſt the heauens frowne, thou thinkeſt
on thy faults, and a cleere ſkie putteth, thee in minde of
grace: the Summers glory tells thee of youths vanitie: the
winters parched leaues, of ages declining weakneſſe. Thus
in a mirrour thou meaſureſt thy deeds with equall and conſiderate
motions, &amp; by being a Shepheard findeſt that which
Kings want in their royalties. Enuy ouer-looketh thée, renting
with the windes the Pine-trees of Ida, when the Affrick
ſhrubs waue not a leafe with the tempeſt. Thine eyes are
vailde with content, that thou canſt not gaze ſo high as ambition,
and for loue: and with that in naming of loue, the
ſhepheard fell into a great laughter. Loue, Menaphon, why
of all follies that euer Poets fained, or men ſaulted with,
this fooliſh imagination of loue is the greateſt. Venus forſooth
for her wanton eſcapes muſt bee a goddeſſe, and her
baſtard a Deitie: Cupid muſt bee yong and euer a boy, to
prooue that loue is fond and witleſſe: wings to make him
inconſtant, and arrowes whereby to ſhew him fearefull:
blind (or all were not worth a pin) to prooue that Cupids leuell
is both without aime and reaſon: thus is the god, and

ſuch are 
                  〈…〉
                as our Shepheards of Arcadie
ſettle themſelues to fancy, and weare the caracters of Venus

quaint, their lookes full of amors, as their, gods

               uiuer is
full of arrowes: their eyes holding ſmiles and teares, to leape
out at their Miſtris fauours or her frownes: ſighes muſt
flie as figures of their thoughts, and euery wrinckle muſt be
tempred with a paſſion: thus ſuted in outware proportion,
and made excellent in inward conſtitution, they ſtraight repaire
to take view of their Miſtris beauty. She as one obſeruant
vnto Venus principles, firſt, 
                  •
               ieth loue in her treſſes,
and wraps affection in the

                of her haire; ſnaring
our ſwaines in her lockes, as Mars in the net, holding in
her forhead Fortunes Kalender, either to aſſigne diſmall
influence, or ſome fauourable aſpect. If a wrinckle appeare
in her brow, then our Shepheard muſt put on his working
day face, and 
                  〈◊〉
                nought but dolefull madrigals
of ſorrow; if a dimple grace her cheeke, the heauens cannot
prooue fatall to our kinde-hearted louers; if ſhee ſeeme
coy, then poems of death mounted vpon deepe drawne ſighs,
flie from their maſter to ſue for ſome fauour, alleadging
how death at the leaſt may date his miſery; to be briefe, as
vpon the ſhoares of

                  , the windes, continue neuer
one day in one quarter, ſo the thoughtes of a louer neuer
continue ſcarce a minute in one paſſion; but as
Fortunes globe, ſo is Fancies caſe; variable and inconſtant.
            If louers ſorrowes then bee like Siſiphus turmoiles, and
their fauours like honny bought with 
                  •
               all; let poore Menaphon
then liue at labour, and make eſteeme of Venus as
of Mars his Coucubine; and as the Cimbrians hold their
idols in account but in euery tempeſt, ſo make Cupid a
god, but when thou art ouer pained with paſſions, and
then Menaphon will neuer loue: for as long as thou tempereſt
thy hande with labours, thou canſt not fetter thy
thoughts with loues. And in this Satyricall humour ſmiling

ſhrubbes feele the leaſt tempeſts, and in the valleys of
Affrica is heard no thunder, that in countrie roomes is
greateſt reſt, and in little wealth the leaſt diſquiet: dignitie
treadeth vpon glaſſe, and honour is like vnto the herbe Sinara,

            All this while Menaphon ſate amongſt the ſhrubs, fixing
his eyes on the glorious obiect of her face, he noted her treſſes,
which hee compared to the coloured Hiacinth of Arcadia,
her browes to the mountain ſnows that lie on the hils:
her eies to 
                  〈◊〉
                gray gliſter of Titans gorgeous mantle, her
alablaſter necke to the whiteneſſe of his flockes, her teares
to pearle, her face to borders of lillies interſeamed with roſes:
to be briefe, our Shepheard Menaphon that heretofore
was an Atheiſt to loue, and as the Theſſalian of Bacchus, ſo
hee a contmner of Venus, was now by the wilie ſhaft of
Cupid ſo intangled in the perfection &amp; beauteous excellencie
of Sepheſtia; as now hee ſwore, no benigne Planet but
Venus, no god but Cupid, no exquiſite deitie but Loue.
Being thus fettered with the pliant perſwaſions of fancie,
impatient in his new affections, as the horſe that neuer
before felt the ſpurre, he could not bridle his new conceiud
amors, but watching when they ſhould depart, perceiuing

in preferring the ſafetie of a flye, before the credit of her

ſhelters of pouerty, &amp; Kings ſeats are couerts for diſtreſſed

               Menaphon, my diſtreſſed haps are the reſolution of the
deſtinies, and the wrongs of my youth are the fore-runners
of my woes in age, my natiue home is my worſt nurcery, &amp;
my friends deny that which ſtrangers preiudicially grant:
I arriued in Arcadie ſhipwrackt, and Menaphon fauoring
my ſorrowes, hath affoorded me ſuccours, for which Samela
reſts bound, and will prooue thankefull: as for loue, know
that Venus ſtandeth on the Tortois, as ſhewing that loue
creepeth on by degrées, that affection is like the ſnaile, that
ſteales to the top of the launce by minutes: the graſſe hath
his increaſe, yet neuer any ſées it augment, the ſun ſhadoweth,
but the motion is not ſéene: loue like thoſe ſhould enter
into the eye, and by long gradations paſſe into the heart:
Cupid hath wings to flie, not that loue ſhould be ſwift, but

being throwne into the fire, burnes ſtrait, but no ſooner out
of the flame but it fréezeth: ſtraw is ſoone kindled, but it is
but a blaze: and loue that is caught in a moment, is loſt in a
minute: giue me leaue, Menaphon, firſt to ſorrow 
                  〈◊〉
                my
fortunes, then to call to mind my huſbands late funeralls,
then if the fates haue aſſigned I ſhall fancie, I will account
of thée before any ſhepheard in Arcadie. This concluſion of
Samela drew Menaphon into ſuch an extaſie for ioy, that
hee ſtoode as a man metamorphozed: at laſt, calling his ſenſes
together, he told her he reſted ſatiſfied with her anſwer,
and thereupon le
                  •
               t her a kiſſe, ſuch as bluſhing Thetis receiues
from her choiceſt Leman. At this Lamedon awaked,
otherwiſe, no doubt, Menaphon had replied, but breaking
off their talke, they went ſo view their paſtures, &amp; ſo paſſing
downe to the place where the ſhéep grazed, they ſearched the
ſhepheards bags, &amp; ſo emptied their bottles, as Samela maruelled
at ſuch an vncouth banquet: at laſt they returned
home, Menaphon glorying in the hope of his ſucceſſe, entertaining
Samela ſtil with ſuch curteſy, y• ſhe finding ſuch content
in the cottage, began to deſpiſe the honors of the court.

Reſting thus in houſe with the Shepheard, to auoyd tedious
conceits, ſhe framed her ſelfe ſo to countrie labours,
that ſhe oft-times would leade the

that was amorous of Paris. As ſhee thus often traced
alongſt the plaines, ſhe was noted amongſt the ſhepheards
of one Doron next neighbour to Menaphon, who entred
into the conſideration of her beauty, and made report of it
to all his fellow ſwaines, ſo that they chatted naught in
the fields but of the new ſhepheard

Doron, before I kept ſheepe in Arcadle, I was a ſhepheard
elſewhere, ſo famous for my flockes, as Menaphon
for his foldes; beloued of the Nimphes, as he likte of the
Country Damſels; coueting in my loues to vſe Cupids
wings, to ſoare high in my deſires, though my ſelfe were
borne to baſe fortunes. The hobby catcheth no prey, vnleſſe

his compaſſe. Grounding therefore on theſe principles, I

            When Melicertus had ended this roundelay in prayſe of
his Miſtris, Samela perceiued by his deſcription, that either
ſome better Poet then himſelfe had made it, or elſe that his
former phraſe was diſſembled: wherfore to try him throughly,
&amp; to ſée what ſnake lay hid vndoe the graſſe, ſhe followed
the chace in this manner. Melicertus, might not a ſtranger
craue your Miſtris name? At this the ſhepheard bluſht, and
made no reply. How now, quoth Samela▪
                what? is ſhée ſo
meane that you ſhame, or ſo high that you feare to bewray
the ſoueraigne of your thoughts? ſtand not in doubt man:
for bee ſhee baſe, I read that mightie Tamberlaine after his
wiſe Xenocrate (the worlds faire eye) paſſed out of the theatre

his humorous fancie. Be ſhée a Princeſſe, honour hangs in
high deſires, and it is the token of a high muld to venter for
a Ouéene: then gentle ſhepheard tell me thy miſtris name.
Melicertus, hearing his Goodeſſe ſpeake ſofauorably, Breathed
out this ſodaine reply: high Samela, and therefore I
feare with the Syrian Wolues to barke againſt the Moone,
or with them of Scyrum, to ſhoote againſt the Starres in the

beautie, but as if loue and fate had ſate to forge my fatall
diſquiet, they trapt me within her lookes, and haling het
Idaea through the paſſage of my ſight, placed it ſo déeply in
the center of my heart, as ma

it ſtill and euer will keepe reſtleſſe poſſeſſion: Noting her
vertues, her beauties, her perfections; her excellence, and
feare of her too high borne parentage, though painefully fettered,
yet haue I ſtill feared to dare ſo hauty an attempt to
ſo braue a perſonage: leſt ſhe offenſiue at my preſumption,
I periſh in the height of my thoughts. This concluſion broken
with an abrupt paſſion, could not ſo ſatiſfie Samela, but
ſhe would be further inquiſitiue. At laſt, after many queſtions,
he anſwered thus: ſéeing, Samela, I conſume my ſelfe,
and diſpleaſe you, to hazard for the ſalue that may cure my
maladie, and ſatiſfie your queſtion, know it is the beauteous
Samela. Be there more of that name in Arcadie, beſide
my ſelfe, qd. ſhe? I know not, ſaid Melicertus, but were there
a million, only you are Melicertus Samela: but of a million,
quoth ſhe, I cannot he Melicertus Samela: for loue hath put
one arrow of deſire in his quiuer, but one ſtring to his how,
and in choice but one ayme of affection. Haue yée alreadie,
ſaid Melicertus, ſet your reſt vpon ſome higher Perſonage?
No, ſaid Samela, I meane by your ſelfe, for I haue heard
that your fancie is linked alredy to a beautiful ſhepherdeſſe
in Arcadie. At this the poore Swaine tainted his chéeks with
a vermillion die, yet thinking to carry out the matter with
a ieſt, he ſtood to his tackling thus: whoſoeuer, Samela, deſcanted
of that loue, told you a Canterburie Tale, ſome propheticall

full mouth, that as hee were a Coblers eldeſt ſon,
would by the Laſt, tell where and thers ſhee wrings, but his
ſowterly ayme was iuſt leuell, in thinking euery looke was
loue, or euery faire word a pawne of loyalty. Then ſaid Samela,
taking him at a rebound, Neither map I thinke your
glances to be fancies, nor your greateſt proteſtation any aſſurance
of déepe affection: therefore ceaſing off to court any
further at this time, thinke you haue proued your

infancie; till on a time walking to the ſhore, where he with
his mother were wrackt, to gather Cockle and pebble
ſtones, as children are wont: there arriued on the ſtrond a
Theſſalian Pirate named Eurilochus, who after he had forraged
in the Arcadian confines, driuing before him a large
bootie of 
                  •

                exhaled into his eyes ſuch

thirſted ſo much after any prey, as this pretty Pleuſidippus
poſſeſſion: But determining firſt to aſſay him by
curteſie, before he a
                  ••
               ailed him with rigour, he began to try
his wit after this manner. My little child, whence art thou,
where wert thou borne, what is thy name, and wherefore
wandereſt thou thus all alone on the ſhoare? I pray yee
what are ye Sir, quoth Pleuſidippus, that deale thus with
me by interrogatories, as if I were ſome run-away? Wilt
thou not tell me then who was thy father? ſaid he, Good ſir,
if ye will néeds know, goe aſke that of my mother. He hath
ſaid well, my Lord, quoth Romanio, who was one of his
ſpeciall aſſociates, for wiſe are the children in theſe dayes
that know their owne fathers, eſpecially if they be begotten
in dog-dayes, when their mothers are franticke with
loue, &amp; yong men furious for luſt. Beſides, who knowes not
that theſe Arcadians are giuen to take the benefit of euery
Hodge, when they will ſacrifice their virginitie to Venus,
though they haue but a huſh of net

               les for their bed? and ſure
this boy is but ſome ſhepheards baſtard at the moſt, howſoeuer
this wanton face importeth more then appearance.
Pleuſidippus eyes at this ſpeech reſolued into 
                  •
               ire, and his
face in purple with a more then common courage in children
of his yéeres and ſtature, gaue him the lye roundly in
this reply: Peſant, the baſtard in thy face, for I am a Gentleman:
wert thou a man in courage, as thou art a cow

proportion, thou wouldeſt neuer haue ſo much impaired thy
honeſty, as to derogate from my honor. Look not in my face,
but leuel at my heart by this that thou ſéeſt: &amp; therwith he

               et

                  •
               riue at him with ſuch ptbble ſtones as he had in his hat, inſomuch
that Romanio was driuen to his héeles, to ſhunne
this ſuddaine haileſhot, and Eurilochus reſolued into laughter,
and in termes of admiration moſt highly extolled ſo excéeding
magnanimitie in ſo little a bodie: which how auailable
it proued, to the confirmation of his fancie that was
before inflamed with his features, let them imagine that
haue noted the imbecillitie of that age, and the vnreſiſted
furie of men at Armes. Sufficeth at this inſtant to
vnfold (all of her circumſtances of praiſe laid apart) that Eurilochus
being far in loue with his extraordinary lineamēts
awaited no farther parly, but willed his men, perforce, to
hopſe him a ſhip-boord, intending as ſoone as euer he arriued
in Theſſalie, by ſending him to the Court as a preſent, to
make peace with his Lord &amp; Maſter Agenor, who not long
before had proclaimed him as a notorious Pirat throughout
all his dominions. Neither ſwarued hee one whit from
his purpoſe: for no ſooner had he caſt anker in the port of Hadrianopolis,
but he arraied him in choiſe ſilkes, and Tyrian
purple, and ſo ſent him as a prize to the king of that Countrey:
who walking as then in his Summer garden, with his
Quéene the beauteous Eriphila, fell to diſcourſe (as one wel
ſéene in Philoſophie) or Hearbs and flowers, as the ſauour
or colour did occaſion: and hauing ſpent ſome time in diſputing
their medicinable properties, his Lady reching him
a Marigold, he began to moralize of it thus merrily: I maruell

the relation of loue twixt him and the Marigold: it ſhould
ſéeme eyther they were loth to incurre the diſpleaſure of
women, by propounding in the way of compariſon any ſer

name, did obſcure the honour of her amours to Apollo, to
whoſe motions reducing the method of her ſpringing, ſhée
waketh and ſtéepeth, openeth and ſhutteth her golden leaues
as he riſeth and ſetteth. Well did you fore-ſtall▪ my exception,
quoth Etiphila, in terming it a ſeruile imitation: for
were the condition of a wiſe ſo ſlauiſh, as your ſimilitude
would inferre, I had as liefe be your page as your ſpouſe,
your dog as your darling. Not ſo, ſwéet wife, anſwered Agenor,
but the compariſon holdeth in this, that as the Marigold
reſembleth the Sun both in colour and forme, ſo each
mans wife ought euery way to be ye image of her huſband,
framing her countenance to ſmile, when ſhee ſées him diſpoſed
to mirth, and contrarywiſe her eyes to teares, hee
being ſurcharge with melancholy: As the Marigold diſplayeth
the orient ornaments of her beautie, and to the
reſplendant view of none but her louer Hyperion: ſo ought
not a woman of modeſtie lay open the allurements of her
face to any but her eſpouſed Phéere, in whoſe abſence, like
the Marigold in the abſence of the Sunne, ſhe ought to ſhut
vp her dores, and ſolemnize continual night, til her huſband,
her Sun making a happy returne, vnſealeth her ſilence with
the ioy of hid ſight. Beléeue mee, but if all flowers (quoth
Eriphila) affoord ſuch influence of eloquence to our aduerſe
Orators, Ile exempt them all from my ſmell, for feare they
be all planted to poiſon. Oft haue I heard (replyed Agenor)

at random, to outbraue the Theſſalonian dames in their
beautie. In this contrariety of thoughts, being all plunged
wel-nigh in a ſpéechleſſe aſtoniſhment, the faire childe Pleuſidippus,
not vſed to ſuch hyperbolicall ſpactators, broke off
the ſilence, by calling for his victuals, as one whoſe empty
ſtomacke ſlace his comming from ſea, was not ouer-cleped
with delicates. Wherout Agenor, reuiued from him trance,
wherein the preſent wonder had inwrapt him, demaunded

more then this, that his mother was a Shephear

               eſſe, and
his owne name, Pleuſidippus, cut off all other interrogatories,
bp calling after his childiſh manner againe, for his dinner.
Whereupon, Agenor, commanding him to bee had in,
and vſed in euery reſpect as the childe of a Prince, began in
his ſolitarie walke by his countenance to ralculate his Natiuitie,
and meaſure his birth by his beautie, contracti

            But leauing yong Pleuſidippus, thus ſpending his youth
in the Theſſalian Court, protected with the tender affection
of ſuch a courteous Foſter-father as Agenor, returne wee
where wee left, backe into Arcadie, and meete his mother
the faire Samela returning from the Foldes: who hauing
diſcourſed by the way as ſhee came home to Lamedon and
Menaphon, what ſhee late ſaw and obſerned in her Sonne,
they both conioyned their iudgements to their concluſion,
that he was doubtleſſe borne to ſome greater fortunes then
ſheepcotes could containe, and therefore it behooued her
to further his Deſtinies with ſome good and liberal education,
and not to detaine him any longer in that trade of life,
which his fortune withſtood: but by the way, to rebuke
him for tyrannizing ſo Lordly ouer the Boyes, left the
neighbour Shepheards might haply intrude the name of iniurie
on them being Strangers; for his inſulting ouer

counſaile, hée would

his Sphere, or the Moone from her Circle, to gaze as the one
did on the beautie of Daphne, or al night contemplate as the

while heard his Tale with attentiue patience, no ſooner beheld
the radiant glorie of this reſplendant face, but as a man
already inſtalled in eternitie, hee exclaimed thus abruptly:
O Arcady, Arcady,

At which words Olympia ſtarting vp ſodainly, as if ſhe
a ſecond Iuno, had taken her Ioue in bed with Alcmens; and
ouercaſting the Chamber with a frowne that was able to
mantle the World with an eternall night, ſhe made paſſage
to her choler in theſe termes of cōtempt: Beardleſſe vpſtart

thy deſert) entred thee ſo déeply in ouer-wéening preſumption,

ſcorne thy clowniſh Arcadie with his inferior compariſons,
as one that prizeth her perfection aboue any created conſtitution.
Pleuſidippus, vpon this ſpéech ſtood plunged in a
great perplexitie, whether he ſhould excuſe himſelfe mildely,
or take her vp roundly: but the latter béeing more leuell to
his humour then the former, hée began thus to rowze vp his
furie: Diſdainfull dame, that vpbraideſt mée with my birth
as it were baſe, and my youth as it were boyiſh: know that
though my Parents and Progeny are enuied by obſcuritie,

where they were, &amp; finding his daughter in ſtrange manner
perplexed with the thoughts of Pleuſidippus departure, her
eyes red, and her chéeks all to be blubberd with her iealous
teares, he took her vp in this māner. Daughter, I thought I
had choſe ſuch a one to be the obiect of your eye, as ye might

already had ſufficiently bitten on ye bridle, took theſe words
more vnkindly then all her former bitterneſſe, which ſhee
diſgeſted but ſowrely: neuertheleſſe making neceſſitie the

Olympia (though ſhe grudged inwardly, yet béeing loth

fulfilled, mentioned in the beginning of this Hiſtorie. Although
this penance excéeded the limits of his patience, yet
hoping that the Oracle was not vttered in vaine, and might

his garments with one of the Heardgroomes of Menaphon,
tracing ouer the plaines in the habite of a ſhepheard,
chanced to meet with Democles as hee was new come into
thoſe quarters, whom miſtaking for an old ſhepheard he began
many impertinent queſtions belonging to the Sheepcotes;

that drew Apollo from heauen to play the Shepheard, that
fetcht Ioue from heauen to beare the ſhape of a Bull for Agenors
daughter, the excellence of ſuch a metaphyſicall vertue,
I mean (ſhepheards) the fame of your faire Samela, houering
in the eares of euery man as a miracle of nature,
brought mee from Theſſaly to féed mine eyes with Arcadies
wonder: ſtepping alongſt the ſhore to come to ſome ſheepecote,
where my wearie limmes might haue reſt. Loue that
for my labors thought to lead me to fancies pauillion, was
my conduct to a Caſtle, where a Theſſalian Knight lyes in
hold; the Portcullis was let downe, the bridge drawne, the
court of gard kept: thither I went, &amp; for my tongue I was
knowne to be a Theſſalian, I was entertained and lodged:
the Knight whoſe yeeres are yong, and valure matchleſſe,
holding in his armes a Lady more beautifull then Loues
Quéene, all blubbred with teares, aſked me many queſtions,
which as I might I replyed vnto: but while he talkt, mine
eye ſurfeiting with ſuch excellence, was detained vpon the
glorious ſhew of ſuch a wonderfull obiect: I demaunded
what ſhe was, of the ſtanders by, and they ſaid ſhe was the
faire Shepheardeſſe, whom the Knight had taken from the
Swains of Arcadie; and would carry with ye firſt wind that
ſerued into Theſſalie: this (ſhepheards) I know, and grieue
that thus your loues ſhould be ouermatcht with Fortune,
and your affections puld backe vp contrarietie or deſtinie.
Melicertus hearing this, the fire ſparkling out of his eyes,
began thus, I tell thée, ſhepheard, if Fates with their forepointing

penſils did pen downe, or fortune with the deepe
varietie reſolue, or loue with his greateſt power determine
to depriue Arcadia of the beautifull Samela, wee would with
our bloud ſigne downe ſuch ſpels on the plaines; that either
our gods ſhould ſummon her to Elizium, or ſhe reſt with vs
quiet &amp; fortunate: thou ſéeſt the ſhepheards are vp in Arimes
to reuenge, only it reſts who ſhal haue the honor and principalitie
of the field. What néeds that queſtion, quoth Menaphon,
am not I the Kings Shepheard, and chiefe of all the
bordering Swaines of Arcadia? I grant, quoth Melicertus,
but am not I a Gentleman, though tyred in a Shepheards
ſkincote, ſuperior to thée in birth, though equall now in profeſſion?
Wel, from words they had falne to blowes, had not
the ſhepheards parted them, and for the auoiding of further
troubles, it was agréed that they ſhould in two Eglog

make deſcription of their loue: and Democles, for he was a
ſtranger, to fit Cenſor, and who beſt could decipher his
Miſtris perfection, ſhould be made generall of the reſt. Menaphon
and Melicereus condeſtended to this motion, and
Democles ſitting as a Iudge, the reſt of the ſhepheards ſtanding
as witneſſes of this combate, Menaphon began thus.

into ſouldiers, and a wandring companie of poore Shepheards,
into a worthie troupe of reſolute Champions: No
doubt, either Pan meanes to play the God of warre, or elſe

I ſée the beginning of your warres, and the pretended end
of your ſtratagems: the ſhepheards hauing a madding humor
like the Greekes to ſéeke for the recouerie of Helena, ſo
you for the regaining of your faire Samela. Héere ſhée is a

hearing the youth ſpeaking thus proudly, hauing
the ſparks of honor freſh vnder the cinders of pouertie, incited
with loue and valour, (two things to animate the moſt
daſtard Therſites to enter combat againſt Hercules) anſwered
thus: Vnknowne yongſter of Theſſalie, if the feare of

the ſhepherdeſſe to Theſſalie: if I vanquiſh thée, thou ſhalt
feele the burden of thy raſhneſſe, and Samela the ſweetneſſe
of her libertie. Pleuſidippus maruelled at the reſolution of
the ſhepheard: but when Domocles heard how if he wonne,
ſhe ſhould be tranſported into Theſſalie, a world of ſorrows
tumbled in his diſcontented braine, that hee hammered in
his head by many meanes to ſtay the faire Samela: for when
Pleuſidippus in a great choler was readie to throw downe

whoſe thoughts are aboue your fortunes, and whoſe
valour more than your reuenewes, know that Bitches that
puppie in haſte, bring forth blind Whelpes, that there is no
herbe ſooner ſprung vp than the Spattarmia, nor ſooner fadeth:

               or his Garland:
defer it ſome thrée daies, &amp; then in ſolemne manner end
the combat. To this good motion, not only Pleuſidippus, and
Melicertus agreed, but all y• company were conſenting, and
vpon pledges of truce giuen, they reſted. But Democle

in couert hee could not conquer, and that in deſpairing
loues ſecrecie was no ſalue, he diſpatcht letters to the Nobilitie
of his Court, with ſtrait charge that they ſhould bée
in that place within three daies with 10000. ſtrong. This
newes came no ſooner to the Generall of his forces, but leuying

ſo many approued Souldiers, hee marched ſecretly
by night to the place Democles in his Letters had preſcribed,
and there ioyfully entertained by the King, they were
placed in ambaſh, readie when the ſignall ſhould hee giuen
to iſſue out of the place, &amp; performe their Soueraignes command.
Well, the third day being come, no ſooner did Titan
ariſe from the watery couch of his Lemman, but theſe two
Champions were readie in the liſts, accompanied with the
rout of all the Arcadian ſhepheards, and old Democles whom
they had appointed for one of the Iudges. Pleuſidippus ſéeing
Melicercus aduance on his ſhield the waues of the Sea,
with a Venus ſitting vpon them, maruelled what the ſhepheard
ſhould be that gaue this Armes, and Melicercus was
as much amazed to ſée &amp; ſtrange Theſſalian Knight vaunt
his Armes without difference: yet being ſo fraught with
direful reuenge, as they ſcorned to ſalute each other ſo much
as with threats, they fell toughly to blowes. Samela ſtanding
on top of a Turret, and viewing the combat, the poore
Lady gréeuing, that for her cauſe ſuch a ſtratageme ſhould
ariſe in Arcadie, her countenance full of ſorrow, &amp; flouds of
teares falling from her eyes, ſhee began to breathe out her
paſſion. Vnfortunate Samela, borne to miſhaps, &amp; forepointed
to ſiniſter fortunes, whoſe bloomes were ripened to miſchāce,
and whoſe fruit is like to wither with deſpaire, in thy
youth ſate diſcontent pruning her ſelfe in thy forehead, now
in thy age ſorrow hides her ſelfe amongſt the wrinckles of
thy face; thus art thou infortunate in the prime, and croſſed
with contrary accidents in thy autumne, as hapleſſe as Helens,
to haue the burden of warres laid on the wings of thy
beauty. And who muſt be the Champion? whoſe ſword muſt
pierce the Helmet of thine enemie? Whoſe bloud muſt purchace
the freedome of Samela, but Melicercus? if he conquer,
then Samela triumphs, as if ſhee had beene chiefe Victor in
the Olympiades: if hee loſe euery droppe falling from his
wounds into the cētre of his thoughts, as his death to him,
ſo ſhall it be to me, the end of my loues, my life, and my
liberty. As ſtil ſhe was about to goe forward in her paſſion,

the trumpet ſounded, and they fell to fi

                  mocles himſelfe wondred to
ſée the courage of the Shepheard, that he tyed the Knight to
ſuch a 
                  •
               ore taſke. Pleuſidippus likewiſe féeling an extraordinary
kind of force, &amp; ſéeing with what courage the Knight
of the Shepheards fought, began to coniecture diuerſly of
the warre, and to feare the euent of the combat. On the
contrary part, Melicertus halfe wearied with the heauie
blowes of Pleuſidippus, ſtood in a maze how ſo yong a wa
                  •
               
ſhould be ſo expert in his weapon.
            Thus debating diuerſly in their ſeuerall thoughts, at
length being both weary, they ſtept backe, and leaning on
their ſwords, tooke breath, gazing each on other. At laſt,
Pleuſiddippus burſt into theſe ſpéeches. Shepheard in life,
though now a Gentleman in armor, if thy degree be better,
I glory, I am not diſgraced with the combate: tell me, how

               , as to beare mine armes on
thy ſhield? Princocks (quoth Melicercus) thou lyeſt, they be
mine owne, and thou contrary to the law of Armes beareſt
my Creſt without difference, in which quarrell, ſéeing it
concerneth my honour, I will reuenge it as farre as my
loues: and with that he gaue ſuch a charging blow at Pleuſidippus
helme, that he had almoſt ouer-turned him: Pleuſidippus
left not the blow vnrequited, but doubled his force:
inſomuch that the hazard of the battell was doubtfull, and
both of them were 
                  •
               aine to take breath againe. Democles
ſéeing his time, that both of them were ſo weakened, gaue
the watch-word, and the ambuſh lept out, ſlaughtered many
of the Shepheards, put the reſt to flight, tooke the two
Champions priſoners, and ſacking the Caſtle, carryed
them and the faire Samela to his Court: letting the Shepheardeſſe
haue her liberty, but putting Melicertus and Pleuſidippus
into a déep and darke dungeon.
            Where leauing theſe paſſionate Louers in this Cataſtrophe,
againe to Doron, the homely blunt Shepheard:
who hauing béene long enamoured of Carmela, much good
wooing paſt betwixt them, and yet little ſpéeding: at laſt,

both of them met hard by the Promontory of Arcadie, ſhee
leading forth her ſheepe, and he going to ſée his new yeaned
Lambes. As ſoone as they met, breaking a few quarter
blowes with ſuch country glances as they could, they géered
one at another louingly. At laſt, Doron manfully began
thus.
            
               Carmela, by my troth good morrow, it is as daintie to ſée
you abroad, as to eate a meſſe of ſwéet milke in Iuly: you are
proued ſuch a houſe-doue of late, or rather ſo good a huſwiſe,
that no man may ſée you vnder a couple of Capons: the
Church-yard may ſtand long enough ere you will come to
looke on it, and the Piper may beg for euery penny he gets
out of your purſe: but it is no matter, you are in loue with
ſome ſtout Ruffler, and yet poore folkes, ſuch as I am, muſt
be content with pottage: and with that, turning his backe,
he ſmiled in his ſléeue, to ſée how kindly he had giuen her the

                  •
               ob: which Carmela ſéeing, ſhe thought to be euen with him
thus.
            Indéed, Doron, you ſay will, it is long ſince we met, and
our houſe is a grange houſe with you: but we haue tied vp
the great dog, and when you come, you ſhall haue green ruſhes,
you are ſuch a ſtranger: but it is no matter, ſoone hote,
ſoone cold, he that mingles himſelfe with draffe, the hogges
will eate him: and ſhée that layes her loue on an vnkind
man, ſhall find ſorrow enough to eate her ſops withall. And
with that, Carmela was ſo ful ſtomackt that ſhe wept.
            
               Doron, to ſhew himſelfe a naturall yong man, gaue her
a few kind kiſſes to comfort her, and ſware, that ſhee was
the woman he loued beſt in the World, and for proofe (quoth
he) thou ſhalt heare what I will prayſe: and you (quoth ſhe)
what I will performe. And ſo taking hand in hand, they
kindly ſate them downe, and began to diſcourſe their loues,
in theſe Eglogues.
