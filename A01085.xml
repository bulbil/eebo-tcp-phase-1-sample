            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            To all that loue
PEACE and
TRVTH.
            
               
                  PEACE, take it
with all faults,
is better then
Warre: and
the ende of a iust warre,
is but Studium Pacis, the
intention of a right peace.
The Subiect then is beyond
exception, to all that
loue Peace. But commonly
they, with whom it meddles,

refuse to meddle with
it. Let such take the course
of their vnhappy precipice
into euerlasting vnquietnesse,
who wilfully reiect
the cure of their affected
maladie: denying their
consciences a trouble that
may saue them, for feare
of loosing a trouble that

                  •
               o
                  •
               h please them. As if a
man were lesse then mad,
that will leap into the fire,
o auoid the smoke. There
is Pax fundamenti, the
peace of Doctrine: and
Pax Ordinis, the peace of
Discipline. The Heretike
would pull downe the first
Pillar, the Schismaticke

the other: The former
would break our peace with
Christ; the latter with our
selues &amp; the Church: both
these are almost desperate.
But there is a third, Pax
Politica, a ciuill Peace:
and the common disturbers
of this are such contentious
spirits; that either
vnprouoked, out of mischieuous
intention: or being
prouoked, out of malicious
reuenge; set all in
vprore, make a mutiny
in manners, an ataxie in
the course of life. To cure
this Babel, if at least shee
will bee cured, is the scope
of this Tractate. Peace

was Christs blessed Legacie
to his Church; and we
are the Ministers whom
he hath chosen to see it payed.
Executours are often
sued for the bequests giuen
by dead Testators: Loe
here a Legacie without suing
from a liuing Father.
Embrace it, and bee regulated
by it: so shall your
hearts finde present comfort,
and your soules eternall
life in it.
            The heartie desirer
of your Peace.

            THE
CITIE
OF
PEACE.
            
               PEACE is the
Daughter of
Righteousnes,
and the moher
of knowledge, the
nurse of Arts, and the
improuement of all blessings.

It is delectable to
al that taste it, profitable
to thē that practise it; to
thē that look vpō it, amiable;
to them that enioy
it, a benefit inualuable.
The building of Christianity
knows no other materials:
if we looke vpon
the Church it self,Ephes. 4. 4 
               There
is one body: if vpō the very
soule of it, There is one
Spirit: if vpō the endowment
of it, There is one
Hope: if vpon the head of
it, There is one Lord: if vpon
the life of it, There is
one Faith: if vpon the
doore of it, There is one
Baptisme: if vpon the

Father of it, There is one
God, and Father of all.
            
            
               Peace is a faire Virgin,
euery ones Loue,The Picture of Peace. the
praise of all tongues, the
obiect of all eyes, the
wish of all hearts; Pacē 
                  
                     •
                  te
poscimus omnes. She hath
a smiling looke, which
neuer frowned with the
lest scowle of anger:
snowy armes, soft as
Downe, and whiter then
the Swannes feathers;
alwaies open to pious
embracements. Her milken
hand carries an Oliue
branch, the Symbole
and Embleme of
quietnesse. She hath the

face of a glorious Angell,
alwaies looking towards
righteousnesse, as
the two Cherubins looked
one vpon the other,
and both vnto the Mercy-Seate.
Her Court is
the inuincible Fort of
integrity; so guarded by
the diuiue prouidence;
that Drummes, Trumpets,
and thundring Canons,
those lowd Instruments
of war, (I meane
Blasphemy, Contention,
Violence) may affront
her, but neuer affright
her. Shee hath a
bounteous hand, virtuall
like the Garment of

Christ; if a faithfull
soule can come to touch
it, to kisse it; all her vexations
are fled, her conscience
is at rest. Her
bowels are full of pitty:
shee is alwayes composing
salues for all the
wounds of a broken
heart, Sedition and tumult
her very soule
hates: shee tramples iniuries
and discords vnder
her triumphant feet.
Shee sits in a Throne of
Ioy, &amp; weares a Crown
of Eternitie: and to all
those that open the
doore of their heart to
bid her welcome, shee

will open the doore of
Heauen to bidde them
welcome, and repose
their soules in euerlasting
Peace.
               The requisitenesse &amp; revvard of Peace. In these
continuall Dogge-daies
of ours, wherein loue
waxeth cold, and strife
hote, wee had need set
our Instruments to the
tune of Peace. This
was the blessed legacie
which Christ bequeathed
to his Church: the
Apostle from his Master
sent it as a token to
the Corinthians: and I
from the Apostle commend
it as a Iewell to
all Christians;2. Cor. 13. 11 
               Liue in

Peace, and the God of Loue
and Peace shall bee with
you. Which conclusion
of the Epistle containes
the blessing of the Apostle':
a Valediction, and
a Benediction. They are
in part Hortatory, in
part Consolatory: the
vertue to which he perswades
them, and the reward
which hee promiseth
them. There is a
sweet symphony, and
respondent proposition
betweene the Counsell
and the Comfort; the
Actiue Peace, and the
Factiue Peace: for seeking
peace on Earth, we

shall find peace in Heauen:
for keeping the
peace of God, wee shall
bee kept by the God of
peace. The one is the
regular Compasse of
our life on Earth, the other
is the glorious
Crowne of our life in
Heauen.
            That wee may not
cherish too weake an opinion
of this duty, wee
must know, that this Apostolicall
counsel is an
Euangelicall law;The forme of a right Lavv. and
binds vs all to the peace.
Liue in Peace: there are
in it all the concurring
qualities, that define a

good law; as Lycurgus
taught: Generalitas, Bonitas,
Possibilitas. It must
be Generall, Good, Possible.
            Generall, so that all
be tied to the obedience
of it. Else it were like Anacharsis
law, a cobweb
to catch flies: or those
tyranous cēsures, which
are made to vex Doues,
while they are indulgent
to Buzzards.
            It must be Good, for
none are bound to the
obedience of vniust
things. If it haue an indifferent
extent to good
or bad, there is easily

found some colour of
euasion.
            It must bee Possible;
for if things be imposed
vltra posse, and so men
be made lyable to the
mulct, when they are
not culpable of the
guilt; they may obiect
that Naturae dictamen.
Nemo tenetur ad impossibile:
none are to be tyed
to the obedience of
impossible things. Such
are Tyrants Lawes; not
vincula, sed retia: not
limits to confine, but
netts to ensnare: not
Pales, but Toiles.
            But the Law of Peace is

General,the equity of Peace none can plead
immunitie. Good, none
taxe it of iniquitie. Possible,
none can say, it is
beyond their abilitie.
But it may be obiected.
If you require it Generall,
it is not Possible:
for wee cannot haue
peace with all men. If it
were Possible, yet is it
not lawfull and good;
for wee may not haue
peace with all men. To
direct vs in this, the Apostle
inserts two cautions.
If it be possible,
               Ro. 12. 18 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                
               as
much as lyeth in you; liue
peaceably with all men.
For there are some cases

in which 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , it is
not possible.
                  
                     •
                   Cor. 6, 15 
               What communion
hath light with
darkenesse! and what concord
hath Christ with Belial!
Wee must haue no
peace with it, if there
be no grace in it.Psalme 1 
               Blessed
is hee that walketh not in
the counsell of the vngodly,
&amp;c. Forbeare not only
to sit in the Chaire of
pestilence with them,
which is Sinne raigning:
               Peccatum dominans, Peccatum delectans, peccatum 
                     •
                  n
                     ••
                  ans.
but euen to stand and
discourse with them,
which is Sinne delighting:
yea euen to walke
a turne with them,
which is Sinne entring:
               
teaching vs to shunne
the very acquaintance
of their counsels.
            But wicked men cannot
be auoided;The termes of Peace distinguished. and so
long as wee are in this
world, wee must con
uerse with men of the
world. To answer this,
we must distinguish betweene
offenders, and
offences: we may haue
no peace with the one,
true peace with the other.
There are two
names,August. 
               Homo &amp; Peccator:
a Man, and a Sinner.
Quod Peccator est,
corripe: quod Homo, miserere.
As he is a Sinner,

reforme him: as he is a
man, the Image of God,
pitie him. Doth thy
Brother sinne of ignorance?
Dilige errantem,
interfice errorem: kill the
error, preserue thy brother.
Doth hee offend
of frailty? Bee at peace
(cum hominibus, non cummoribus)
with the man,
not with the manners.
Trespasseth hee of malice?
Hate (vitium, not
virum) the disease, not
the patient. Howsoeuer
these infirmities are ineuitable,
still wee may
haue Peace, Cum malis,
licet non in malis: with

euill men, though not
in euill matters.
            Indeede let him that
hath anthority, correct
malicious offences: for
that is not like a rauisher
to abuse, but like a Chā
               pion
to vindicate the honour
of peace. Yet still
Cum corrigat malitiam,
diligat personam; let him
correct the transgression,
loue the person.
            But how shall we answere
that of the Psalmist?Psal. 59. 5.
               Be not mercifull to
them that sinne of malitious
wickednesse. This
was not Precantis votum,
sed Prophetantis vaticinium:
               
not the request of
a Petitioner, but the prediction
of a Prophecier.
Hee did not wish it
should be so, but saw it
would be so.
            But if all this be true,
wee may then admit
peace with Rome? Wee
doe accept a Ciuill, not
a Religious peace. In a
treatise of pacification,
both parties must yeeld
somwhat: but nothing is
to be yeelded that may
preiudice the Truth. In
a Musicall Instrument
the strings that bee out
of tune, are set vp, or set
downe to the rest: the

strings that be in tune,
are not stirred. Our Doctrine
and Profession are
tuned to the blessed Gospell,
that infallible Canon
of Truth, and therefore
must not bee changed.
Their Faith and
Religion iarreth and erreth
from that; therefore
must bee proportioned
to ours, if they will endenour
a perfect Harmony.
            Thus far,The life of Peace. &amp; vpon these
tearmes wee may haue
peace, if we seeke it: we
may liue in peace, and
peace may liue in vs, if
we desire it. Therefore

still 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                
               Liue in
peace. Caluin renders it,
Pacem agite, Doe peace.
Or, as if God should say
to men, whom he found
quarrelling, or too
lowd; Peace. The word
is emphaticall, and imitates
a continual habite:
wee may call it, The
Exercise of peace, or
the Practice of peace.
            Some haue a good
mind to peace,The neglect. but they
will bee at no labour about
it: many are content
to embrace it, but
they are ashamed to seek
it: most men loue it, few
practise it. The vse commends

the vertue: the
beautie and praise of
peace consists not in
motion, but in action:
nor is the benefit of it in
a knowing discourse, but
in a feeling sense. A Speculatiue
peace, is like an
Historicall knowledge:
such as he that hath bin
alwayes confined to his
study, may haue of forraine
countries: so wee
make a conquest of
peace, as the byword
sayes, our Fathers
wonne Boloigne; who
neuer came within the
report of the Canon.
Or if the Grecians kept

Philosophy in their
leaues, but kept it not in
their liues. A ieiune and
emptie speculation, like
some subtill ayre in the
head, onely breakes out
into crochets: it is experience
that brings the
sweetnesse of peace
home to the heart. Vse
breeds perfectnesse, and
disuse looseth the most
seruiceable things. Gold
looseth more of the
waight by rusting in
corners, then by continuall
running in commerces,
the proper end
it was coyned for. The
best land will yeeld smal

encrease, if it be not tilled:
though some haue
the most profitable
trades, the want of industry
hath made them
the poorest men. The
throne of peace is in the
heart, not in the head.
            To recouer,The Method. therefore
the swouning life of this
vertue, I will compare
Peace to a Citie: if you
will, to this City: which
should be like Ierusalem,
A Citie of Peace. And so
much we will pray for
it; that it may preserue
peace, and peace may
preserue it, to the
worlds end.
            
               
Let the walles of this
Citie be Vnitie and Concord.
Let her haue foure
Gates; Innocence, and
Patience; Benefaction,
and Satisfaction. The
first gate of peace is Innocence;
she must doe no
wrong. The second is
Patience; she must suffer
wrong. The third is Beneficence;
she must doe
good in stead of wrong.
The fourth is Recompence;
she must make liberall
and iust satisfaction
for any committed
wrong. There is also a
Posterne Gate, and that is
Humility. A gate indeed,

but a small and low
one; whosoeuer enters
the Citie of peace that
way, must stoop before
he get in. The enemies
of this Citie are many;
diuided into two bands;
Hostilitie and Mutinie
The Gouernour of it, is
Magistracie: the Law,
Religion: the Palace, the
Temple: the life of the
Citizens is Loue. It is
serued by the Riuer of
Prosperitie; the State of
it, is Felicitie: the Inheritance,
eternall Glory.
            
               The Wals of Peace.
               Are Vnitie and Concord.

                  Omnis Societas est
corpus politicum: and it
is in a Citie, as in a Bodie:
there are many
members, one body:
many Citizens, one Citie.The Body is a figure of Vnitie.
The Body is one of
the most liuely figures
and examples of peace.
Wee are all one Body:
                  1 Cor. 12 not
onely one Kingdome; so
disparitie in Religions
make many differences.
Nor only one Citie, Inter
dites erunt lites; so
disparitie of estates will
breed quarrels. Nor only
one House, so wee
may haue enemies of our
owne houshold. But one

                  Body, here must be al loue
&amp; peace. Where all are
tied by bonds, ioynts, &amp;
ligaments to the head;
there also by the fame
Nerues one to another.
               Some mēbers are single;
as the tongue is one,
to speake one truth:Mutuall Loue. the
heart one, to entertaine
one God. Other are Gemina,
Germana; their forces
are doubled to supply
mutuall defects.
Some are stronger, as
the armes and leggs; for
the supportation of the
weaker. Thus qualified
are all the faithfull citizens
of Peace; preseruing

an vnanimitie in affection,
a sympathy in
affliction, a ready helpe
to the most needful condition.
Comforting the
mindes of those that are
perplexed, supplying the
wants of those that are
distressed, rectifying the
weaknesse of those that
are vnsetled, informing
the ignorance of those
that are seduced, and
reforming the errors of
those that are peruerted:
all endeauoring the deliuerāce
of the oppressed.
               The mēbers prouide
one for another:Prouidence of parts for the vvhole▪
                   the eye
sees not only for it selfe,

but for the Body: the
hand works not only for
it self, but for the Body:
the eare hearkens, the
tongue talkes, the foote
walkes, all parts exercise
their functions for the
good of the whole. In
the Citie of peace men
must not only seek their
owne, but the glory of
their Maker, and the
good of their Society.
That God who hath giuen
vs honour by our
Ancestors, would also
haue vs adde honour to
our Successors. To preferre
a priuate good before
a publike; is to famish▪
                  
and starue the
whole Body, to fatt a
toe, or pleafe a finger.
Such Monopolies and
Patents, as impouerish
the whole, to enrich a
part are not tolerable
in the Citie of Peace.
               There is no enuy and
grudging among the
members:Discontents remoued. the eye doth
not grieue to see the
arme grow strong, nor
the foote to bee sensible
of the Stomacks health.
In this Citie, one should
not enuy anothers thriuing;
as if all were taken
from our selues that
is giuen to our neighbours.

The Lord sees
that an inequality is best
for his glory: distributing
(to whomsoeuer
lest, yet) to euery one
more then hee deserues.
Shall the Eare say,
                  
                     
                        •
                      Cor. 12. 16. 
                  Because
I am not the Eye, I am not
of the Body? No, but
as Iohn Baptist said of
Christ▪ 
                  He commeth after
me, yet is before me:
Some come after vs in
wealth, that may goe
before vs in grace. The
poore man is not so many
pounds behinde the
rich for this world, as
he may be talents before
him for the world to

come. They often with
their pouertie, miserie,
ignominy, are saued;
whiles others with all
their honour and opulencie
goe to hell.
               If one member suffer,Condolency of the members.
the rest suffer with it. If
there be a thorne in the
foote, the eye shedds a
teare, the heart akes, the
head grieues, the hand
is ready to pull it out. If
a man tread on our toe,
wee say, Why doe you
tread on Me? Quod cuiquam,
cuivis: let vs sorrow
for the afflictions
of others, as if we were
in the body. He is no sonn

of Peace, that forgets the
breaking of his brother
Ioseph.
                  Amo. 6. 6.
               
               The Walls of the Citie
must bee whole,Schisme dangerous. no
breaches in them, least
this aduantage the enemies
entrance. There
must bee no schisme in
a Citie, as no diuision
in the Body: one must
not be for Paul, another
for Apollos, another for
Cephas; but all for
Christ; &amp; all for Peace.
Many euill men may
haue one will in wickednesse.
It is said of Pilate
Tradidit Iesum volun
                        •
                     a
ti
                        •
                     earum;
                  Luk 23. 25 Hee deliuered

Iesus to their Will; not
wills: many sinners, one
will. Shall then the
Sonnes of grace iarre?
The Children of Peace
be mutinous? Vnica columba
mea, saith Christ:
My Doue is but one; the
Doue is a Bird of peace.
Many of them can agree
louingly together in one
house: euery one hath
a litle cottage by her
selfe, wherein shee sits
content without disquieting
her neighbours.
Thus Dum singulae quaerunt
vnionem, omnes conseruant
vnitatem. Wee
haue them that rush into

others Tabernacles,
swallowing a man and
his heritage: would
Doues doe thus? Poore
Nabaoths portion is many
a rich Ahabs eyesore;
would Doues doe
thus? Numbers are still
on the wing, to prey vpon
prostrate fortunes;
these bee Rauens, not
Doues: If the Law cannot
make worke for
their malice, their malice
shall make worke
for the law. This is like
Cockes of the Game,
to pecke out one anothers
eyes, to make the
Lawyers sport. When

two friends are fallen
out of loues into blows,
and are fighting; a third
aduersary hath a faire
aduantage to kill them
both. We haue an enemy
that watcheth his
time, and while wee
wound one another, hee
wounds vs all.
               If the members bee
pulled a sunder,Distraction mortall. they all
rott: the distraction of
parts is the dissolution
of the whole. If we forsake
the peace of our
Mother, wee put our
selues vpon record for
bastards Discontēt with
our owne portions and

places, ouerthrowes the
Citie of Peace.2 Esdr. 4. 1. When
the Woods and the Floods
were at variance, the
Sand and the Fire were
fain
                     •
                   to quiet their insurrections.
While men
will not rest satisfied
with their owne determinate
stations; but inuade
the seueralls and
proprieties of others;
what can bee expected
but destruction? If
there be Contention on
this side, and Ambition
on that side, there
will bee confusion on
all sides. While Iudah
was hot against

Israel, and Israel hott against
Iudah, the King
of Syria smote them
both. God shall supply
the part of Syria; and
when brother is against
brother, hee will bee against
them all. He that
doth not what he can to
mainetaine the walles
doth what he can to betray
the Citie. So I
come from the Walles
to the Gates.
            
            
               
                  The first Gate
                  Is Innocence;
                     The first Foundation of Peace. and this
may bee called Bishopsgate;
the Ministers of
the Gospell being both

the Preachers and Precedents
of Innocencie.
If men would abstaine
from doing wrong▪ the
Peace could not be broken.
St. Bernard writes
of the Doue, that Felle
caret, she hath no Gall:
Let vs bee such Doues
to purge our harts from
all bitternesse.
                  Now the first shelfe
that wracks Innocence,
is Anger. It were rare if
the wrath of man should
fulfill the righteòusnesse of
God:
                     The angry man cannot be Innocent. euen a curst anger
breakes the Peace.
It is an euidence whereby
God will iudge men

guilty: now there is
no malefactor going to
the barre for his try all,
would willingly haue
that euidence found about
him, that should
cast him. Iratus non videt
legem, sed Lex videt
iratum. The wrathfull
man takes no notice of
the Law, but the Lawe
takes notice of the
wrathfull man. Let vs
take heede lest wee
carry our anger with vs
vnto God. That which
offends our eyes, we remoue
either our sight
from it, or it from our
sight▪ but that which offends

our soules, we too
often lay next our heart.
But, it is the voice of
transportiue fury, I cannot
moderate my anger.
Cannot? Wherfore serueth
grace, but to mortifie
such natural, yea rather
vnnatural passions?
                  How easily doth this
rage often inueter at; making
some so angry with
men, that they will searse
bee pleased with God
himselfe! And either he
must take thē with their
anger, or let them alone.
So soone it rankles into
malice, &amp; that is full opposite
to Innocence.
                  
                     
What shall a man do?
In this sudden fitt shall
he come to the Lords
Table, or forbeare it?
Si non accesserit, periculum:
Si accesserit, damnum.
To refuse the Sacrament
in anger, is euill:
to receiue it in anger,
thats worse. Is the
Body &amp; Bloud of Christ
no more worth, but that
for loue of a peeuish humour
we should neglect
it? Shall we starue our
consciences, to feed our
misbegotten passions?
What is then to be done
in this straight? The
answer is easie: Let vs

excommunicate our
wrath, that wee may
communicate with the
Church: leaue our lusts
behinde vs, and wee are
welcome;Gen. 22. 5 as Abraham
left his Asse when hee
went about his Sacrifice.
In the Leuiticall
Law no vncleane thing
might be touched: if it
were touched, the Temple
by that person must
not be approched. Now
for the Israelite to absent
himselfe from the
assembly of Saints, and
seruice of God, was
ponderous: to come
so polluted, was dangerous.

He knew the remedie;
either not to be vncleane
at all, or soone to
get himselfe clensed.
The first best is to harbour
no malice; the next
to deliuer our selues
from it with all possible
speed.
                  In a word, let vs turne
our anger whē it comes,
another way. Let all our
hate be the hate of sin;
and all our anger bent
against our owne corruptions.
Let our wrath,
like the Shepheards
dogge, sleepe till the
Wolfe comes. Be we at
peace with God by repentāce,

with our neighbour
by innocence, with
our owne heart by a purified
and pacified conscience;
and the Prince
of peace, the Lord Iesus
shall embrace vs.
               
               
                  The second Gate
                  Is Patience;
                     The second Foundation of Peace. which is
not vnlike to Ludgate:
for that is a Schoole of
patiēce; the poore soules
there learne to suffer.
The first entrance of
peace is to doe no iniury,
the next is to suffer
iniury. It is one speciall
commendation of
Charitie, that it Suffers

all things; Pro fratribus,
a fratribus, propter fratres.
For our brethren
wee must sustaine some
losse: hee that suffers
not an abatement of his
owne fulnesse, to supply
their emptinesse, is no
brother. Of our brethren
wee must put vp
some wrong, rather
then make a slaw in the
smooth passage of
peace. Because of our
brethren, and for the Elects
sake,
                     2 Tim 2. 18 
                     we must endure
all things, that they may
obtaine Saluation. Let vs
bee infirmed, to haue
them confirmed: brooking

a temporal losse, to
procure their eternall
good.
                  According to the Apostles
counsell, Let vs
beare the burthen one of
another,
                     Gal. 62. and God shall
beare the burthen of vs
all. As in the Arch of a
building, one stone
beares mutually, though
not equally, the waight
of the rest. Or as Deere
swimming ouer a great
water, doe ease themselues
in laying their
heads, one vpon the
backe of another: the
formost hauing none to
support him, changeth

his place, and rests his
head vpon the hindmost.
Beare thou with
his curiousnes, hee doth
beare with thy furiousnes:
let mee beare with
his arrogance, hee doth
beare with my ignorance.
In Architecture,
all stones are not fit to
bee laid in euery part of
the building: but some
below, as the fundamentall,
and chiefe cornerstone
to sustain the load
of the rest: some higher
in the wall, other in the
top for ornament. In
the Church, which is
built of Liuing Stones,
                     
Christ is the Head of the
corner, the Foundation
that supports all. Gracious
Saints haue the
next places, and are
so set that they may
helpe to beare vp the
weaker.
                  Materialls that bee
onely of a hard nature,
will neuer fadge well
in an Edifice. The Italians
haue a Prouerbe;
Hard without soft, the wal
is nought. Stones cobbled
vp together, without
morter to combine
them, make but a tottering
wall. But if there be
morter to ciment them,

and with the tractable
softnesse of the one to
glew and fixe the solide
ha
                        •
                     dnesse of the other;
this may fortifie it against
the shocke of the
Ramme, or shot of the
Canon. The societie
that consists of nothing
but stones, intractable
and refractory spirits,
one as froward and peruerse
as an other, soone
dissolues. But when one
is reaking with the fire
of rage, and another
shall bring the water of
patience to coole and
quench it; here is a duration
of peace. When

yron meets yron, there
is a harsh and stubborne
iarre: let wooll meete
that rougher mettal, and
this yeelding turnes resistance
into embracements.
                  Let not then the voice
be an eccho of ill words,
nor the hand a Racket
to bandy back fire-bals.
Patience makes euen the
wicked confesse; Thou
art more righteous then I.
Infoelix victoria qua hominem

succūbi.
                     18. Bern. It is a wretched
victory that ouercomes
our soules, and slaues vs
to our lustes. Patientia

mea à Domino,
                     Psal. 62. 5. as the Fathers
read it: and indeed
who can giue this patience,
but God? Paul had
many liues, yet he sacrificed
them all;Cor. 15. 
                     I die daily.
Etsi non mortis experientia,
                     31. Chrys.
                     tamen proposito.
Though he could loose
but one, yet in regard of
his patience and purpose,
hee was ready to
loose them all.
                  Nor is Christian patience
thus confined within
the bearing of iniuries;
but it extends also
to the remitting of
them. Some can suffer
for the present, as Haman
                     
before Mordecay,
Animo vindicandi. Forgiuenesse
is the demonstration
of patience. Not
to contest because wee
cannot conquer, is called
Patience perforce:
but can we remit? The
ciuill man can forbeare,
the Christian must forgiue.
Let vs bee remisse
to note a wrong, remissiue
to forget it, writing
all our iniuries in the
dust. Yea, let humilitie
sweetly order our forgiuenes:Sen.
for Grauissima
poena est contumeliosa venia:
a proud and scornfull
pardon, is a reprochfull

wrong; there is in it
more bitternesse then
mercie; more punishment
then reconcilement.
                  Otherwise how can
we pray, Forgiue vs our
trespasses, As wee forgiue
them that trespasse against
vs? O but say some,
God is merciful: what,
shall wee therefore bee
vnmercifull? I may forgiue,
but I cannot forget;
is the faint reseruation
of another. Take
we heed, let not vs be in
iest with God, least hee
be in earnest with vs. Do
we not otherwise beg a

remouall of mercie and
pardon from our owne
soules? Will not God
say, Euill seruant, Ex ore
tuo, out of thy owne
mouth wil I iudge thee?
Hath Christ with his
owne blood made thee
friends with God, and
cannot that blood intreat
thee to bee friends
with thy brother,Mat. 
                           •

holy Altar with thy gift,
and remembrest thy offended
brother: Leaue

                      first be reconciled
to him, then
offer to God. A gift doth
pacifie wrath, and God is

pleased with our Sacrifice
vpon his Altar: yet
Cum omnis culpa munere
soluatur,
                     Aug. 
                     sola iniuria incondonata

euery fault is solued
with a gift, Iniury alone
is sent away without
pardon.

If an iniurer, aske pardon:
if a sufferer, giue

pardon. Be we so farre
from expecting his submission,
that wee tender
our
                        ••
                     emission; and meet
the trespasser with a

Christ healed
Malchus his eare, that
came to arrest him.
Which amongst vs so
loues his benefactors, as
Paul loued his malefactors?
Hee would doe
any thing to saue them,
that would do any thing
to kill him. Others offences

to vs are but
small; valued with ours
against God who is infinite.

at the farthing tokens.
               
               
                  The next Gate
                  Is Beneficence; Doing
good,The third foundation of Peace. is the fortification
of peace. This may be
called Ald-gate; not only
because there is the
picture of Charitie: (at
the gate: I doe not say,
as neere going out; but
at the gate, to keepe
goodnesse in.) But because
that is called the
Old-gate, and Charitie

was a vertue of olde
times, not so much now
in fashion. The heathen
Moralist said, wee must
vse men thus; Benevelle
omnibus, benefacere amicis;
wish well to all, and
doe good onely to our
friends. But the cleere
light of nature, which is
the Gospell, chargeth vs
while wee haue opportunitie,Gal. 6. 10.
                     to doe good to all
men; albeit with some
preferment of the best,
especially to the houshold of
Faith.
                  
                  All men may bee ranked
vnder one of these
combinations: Rich and

poore, home-borne and
strangers, friends &amp; enemies.
First for the rich
and poore; the Pharisee
wil stand on good terms
with the rich, inuite
them for a re-inuitation
as men at Tennisse, tosse
the ball to another, that
hee may tosse it to them
againe: but who helpes
the poore?Pro. 19. 4. 
                     Wealth maketh
many friends, but the
poore is separated from his
neighbours. If hee doe
well, he is not regarded:
if ill, hee is destroyed.
The poore man by his
wisdome deliuered the
citie from the force of a

puissant enemy; yet whē
all was done,Eccl. 9. 15. 
                     no man remembred
that poore man.
But if hee stumble,
                     Ecclus. 13. 23. 
                     they
will helpe to ouerthrowe
him. How contemptibly
doth a rich epicure look
vpon a poore beggar!
yet the rich and the poore
meete together,
                     Prou. 22. 2 
                     and the
Lord is the maker of them
all. In all our graund
Feasts, the guestes that
Christ spoke for,Luk. 14. 14. are left
out.
                  For Domestickes and
strangers; many haue so
much religion as to prouide
for their owne; yea
so much irreligion as to

do it with the preiudice
of the publicke good,
and hazard of their own
soules: but who prouides
for strangers?Heb. 13. 2. 
                     Entertaine
strangers, for
thereby some haue entertained
Angels vnawares:
but for all this possible
happinesse, few will put
it to the venture: and
were they indeed Angels
without angels in
their purses to pay for
it, they should find cold
entertainment.
                  Friends and enemies;
for friends, many will be
at peace with them, till
they bee put to the triall

by some expressiue action.
And then they will
rather hazard the losse
of a friend, then the lest
losse by a friend. But
suppose we answere our
friendes in some slight
courtesie, hoping for a
greater: who will doe
good to his enemies? If
thine enemie hunger,
                     Ro. 12. 20. 
                     feed
him▪ so thou shalt heape
soales of fire on his head.
Do it, not with an intent
to make his reckoning
more, but thy owne reckoning
lesse. Loue your
enemies,
                     Mat. 5. 44. 
                     blesse them that
curse you, doe good to them
that hate you, and pray for

them that despitefully vse
you. Doe vnto them
deeds of amitie, deeds
of charitie, deeds of pietie.
Of amitie, Loue
them that hate you: of
Charitie, Doe good to
them that hurt you: of
Pietie, Pray for thē that
persecute you. There is
the Diligite of the Heart,
Loue your enemies. The
Benedicite of the Tongu,
Blesse them that curse
you. The Benefacite of
the Hand, Doe good to
them that hate you. The
Beneuelle of all, Pray for
thē that persecute you.
Loue your enemies,

there is Affectus cordis:
Doe them good, there is
Effectus operis: Pray for
them, there is Perfectio
charitatis. But the wiseman
counsels;Eccl. 12. 5. 7. 
                     Doe well
to him that is lowly, but
giue not to the vngodly.
And Giue vnto the good,
not to the sinner. Though
not Qua impius, and quia
impiu
                           •
                        ; yet qua homo; and
quia homo, wee must releeue
him. Cherish himselfe,
not his sinne. Wee
must loue him, non quoad
culpam, sed quoad naturam.
They are Gods
children, licet insani, although
they be sick; and

our brethren, licet infirmi,
although they bee
weake. Therefore for
the conformitie of nature,
because we are the
same workmanship: for
our owne benefite, for
hee that doth good to
his enemy, euen in that
doth better to himselfe:
and for the imitation of
Him wee worship, let vs
vphold Peace by Charitie.
His Sunne rises,
and raine falls, both on
the iust and vniust. Noli
negare,
                     Mat. 5, 45. 
                     quod Deus nulli
negat. Thus looking vp
with pietie to the Lords
perfection, and downe

with pitie vpon mans
imperfection, let vs doe
good to all.
                  Through the gate of
Beneficence, doth the
charitable man enter into
the Citie of Peace.
Hee that is couetous,
must needs be mutinous.
He that is greedy of gaine,
                     Pro. 15. 27.
                     troubleth his owne house
Salomon cals him a trouble-house,
and wee doe
find him a trouble-citie;
as Demetrius did all Ephesus.
But Charitie
makes peace; Diuitem
voluit Deus vt pauperem
adiuvaret, Pauperem voluit
vt diuitem probaret.
                     
God makes some rich,
to helpe the poore: and
suffers some poore, to
try the rich. The loaden
would bee glad of ease:
now charitie lighteneth
the rich man of his superfluous
and vnweldy
cariage. When the poor
find mercy, they will be
tractable: when the rich
find quiet, they should
bee charitable. Would
you haue your goods
kept in Peace? First, lock
them vp by your prayers,
then open them againe
with your thankfull
vse, and trust them
in the hands of Christ

by your Charitie.
                  This Citie heares ill
for oppression, and is (I
feare too iustly) suspected
of Iniustice: now
the most noble confutation
of iealousie, is by
deeds of charitie. This
is the East-gate to the
Citie of Peace, and I
may (from Saint Paul)
call it the principall, and
most excllent way.
                     1. Cor. 12. 31. Whosoeuer
can shew you the
way better, yet certainly
none can shew you a
better way.
               
               
                  The fourth Gate
                  Is Recompence, or Satisfaction;
                     
and this we may
liken to Creeple-gate. It
is the lamest way to
peace, yet a way: it is a
halting gate, but a gate.
It were far better comming
into this Citie by
any of the former gates,
yet better at this then
none. All come not in
by Innocence, nor all by
Patience, nor all by Beneficence:
but if they
haue failed in these, they
must be admitted by recompence,
or not at all.
The first best is to do no
iniury; the next is Satisfaction,
to make amends
for that wee haue done.

                     Hortensins sayd of his
mother, Ego nunquam
cum ea inivi gratiam, I
neuer was reconciled to
her, because we two neuer
fell out. O that the
Inhabitants of this citie
could say so of their
neighbours; Wee neuer
were made friends, because
wee neuer were
foes.Non operter Officii, sed potius officiendi. But as our Sauiour
saith, It is necessary that
offences doe come: not
that it should be so, but
that it will be so. There
is no necessity that compels
a man to sinne; except
that the heart being
euill, will giue offence.

As it is necessary
for him that comes to
the fire, to be made hot:Hieron.
but there is no necessity
that hee come vnto the
fire.
                  The malady of offences,
will bee contracted,
therefore the onely
Cure is by Satisfaction.
That wee may know
how to doe this, the
Scripture sets downe diuers
degrees in the accomplishment
of this
Satisfaction for iniuries.
First, he must goe to the
party wronged. Secondly,
He must confesse his
fault. Thirdly, He must

humble himself. Fourthly,
He must make restitution.
Fiftly, Hee must
reconcile himselfe. Sixtly,
and this must be done
quickly, with all possible
speed.
                  He must goe to him,
not tarry till hee meete
him, or till some occasion
bring them together;Mat. 5. 24.
not Obuiamda; But Goe
to thine aduersary, goe
on purpose: enquire for
him, seeke him out, rest
not till thou finde him.
                  Humanity may worke
some to this vndertaking,
and ouertaking of
peace: but man is naturally

so good a constructor
of his owne doings,
that will hee confesse his
fault?Num. 5. 7. Yes, He shall confesse
his trespasse.
                  
                  An ingenious nature
may be brought to acknowledge
his fault:
but will Pride, the contention-maker,
admit
Humilitie? will hee
stoope to him hee hath
abused? From insultation
will hee descend to
submission? He must;
Goe and humble thy selfe.
                     Prou. 6. 3.
                  
                  Touch of conscience
may procure Humilitie;
but yet wll he not spend
twice as much at Law,

ere he make restitution?
Yet euen here, a quiet
man for his owne peace
sake may be brought to
giue somewhat, for a
part of amends: but
will hee satisfie him the
whole? The law of nature
requires total satisfaction,
but will hee besides
giue dammages?
The law of the Land allowes
dammages; but
now will hee giue any
ouerplus to make an attonement?
or bee at so
much coast as to buy a
reconcilement, rather
then misse it? He must:
Zacheus restores fourefold;
                     
and by the Law he
is bound to adde a fifth
part.
                     Num. 5. 7.
                  
                  But if all this be done,
will hee yet euer bee
friends with him? will
he be truely reconciled?
Hee must:Mat. 5. 24. 
                     Reconcile thy
self to thy brother. Otherwise,
when he desires of
the Lord to be forgiuen,
as hee forgiueth; God
will answer as Ioseph did
to his brethren;Gen. 43. 3. 
                     Looke
me not in the face, vnlesse
thy brother bee with thee.
Shall the father thinke
wel of that sonne, which
reiecteth his brother?
Doe we call the Author

of Peace, our God, while
wee are the children of
dissention? Will he euer
agree with him, that delights
to quarrell with
his? But suppose the iniurer
doth intreate and
perswade himself, without
pr
                        •
                     uailing, will he
vse his friendes about
such a businesse? Yes,
saith Seolomon, hee must
employ his friends.
                  Time may worke all
this, but to doe it when
the flesh trembles, and
the blood boyles for reuenge,
suddenly; who
can so preuaile ouer him
selfe? He must doe it

                     quickly;
                     Mat 5. 25. 
                     Agree with thine
aduersary quickly. Yes
perhaps, when leasure
may serue: but will any
man neglect businesse to
goe about it? Yes, all
busines set apart, though
it were as important as
offring sacrifice at Gods
owne Altar; Leaue there
thy gift,
                     Pelican. 
                     &amp;c. Non experieris
Deum tibi propitium,
nisi proximus te sentiat
sibi placatum. Strife with
our brother makes our
best seruices vnacceptable
to our Father. The
Lord despiseth his own
worship, to maintain our
charitie: and will not be

found of vs,Chysost. till we haue
found our brother, to
make our peace with
him. Come not to the
Temples, heare no Sermons,
say not your praiers,
forbeare all worship
and deuotions, while a
festring and rankling hatred
is in your soules.
                  Yet now all this may
be done of an Inferiour
to a Superior, either for
feare or hope of gaine
by his loue: but would
you haue a Superiour
yeeld thus to an Inferior,
to deprecate strife?
Yes, Abraham disdained
not to goe vnto Lot, the

elder to the yonger, the
vncle to the nephew, the
worthier to the meaner,
and that in the kindest
manner, to compose a
controuersie begun by
their seruants. O that
this age, which seldome
wakes but to doe mischiefe,
would yet think,
how after all iniuries to
others, they doe this
greatest iniury to their
owne soules; that for
want of a iust compensation,
they exclude
themselues from the
blessing of Peace!
                  
                  These bee the maine
Gates, there is a little Posterne
                     
besides, that is Humilitie:
for of all vices,Humilitie the conseruation of Peace.
Pride is a stranger to
Peace. The proud man
is too guiltie, to come in
by Innocence: too surly,
to come in by Patience:
he hath no minde
to come in by Benefaction:
and he scornes to
come in by Satisfaction.
All these Portcullises be
shut against him: there
is no way left but the
Postern for him, he must
stoope, or neuer bee admitted
to peace. Pride is
alwayes enuious &amp; contumelious,
thinking shee
addes so much to her

owne reputation, as shee
detracts from others:
she is no fit neighbor for
Peace.
               
            
            
               Heauen is a high Citie,
yet hath but a low
Gate.Aug. 
                  Celsa patria, via
humilis. Tolle super biam,
quod habes meum est▪ tolle
inuidiam, quod habe
                        •
                     
tuum est. Take away
pride, and that which
thou hast is mine: take
away enuie, and that
which I haue is thine.
Pride and enuy are too
vnciuill for a peaceable
citie: the one cannot endure
a vicine prosperity,
nor the other a superior

eminency. All men must
bee poore to please the
one, and all must be base
to content the other.
Peace is humble, pride
quite ouer-lookes her.
The Philosopher might
haue seene the starres in
the water, he could not
see the water in the
starres, when hee stumbled
into the ditch. Men
may behold glory in humilitie,
they shall neuer
find peace in ambition.
The safest way to keepe
fire, is to take it vp in
embers: the best means
to preserue peace, is in
humblenesse. The tall

Cedars feele the fury of
tempests; which blow
ouer the humble shrubs
in the low vallies. There
was no rule with Paul
at first; raising tumults,
speeding Commissions,
breathing out slaughters
against poore Christians.
But when Christ
had thundred him from
his horse, broken his
wild spirit to humilitie,
thē he was fit for peace.
God, that often effectuates
his owne will by
contraries, makes trouble
the preparation for
peace: as a father corrects
his vnruly children

that they may be quiet.
Let vs examine our
owne experience: when
the Lord hath soundly
scourged vs, we go from
vnder his fingers as tame
as lambs: farewell strife,
all our care is to finde
rest and peace in Iesus
Christ.
               Wee haue seene the
Citie of Peace, with her
walles and gates, and
wee wish well to her;
Peace bee within thy wals,
                  Psal. 122. 7.
                  and prosperitie within thy
palaces. But hath she no
aduersaties? Yes, there
is an enemic that beleaguers
this Citie; Contention.
                  
Whose army is
diuided into two Bands
or Troups;The Enemies of Peace. the one called
the Ciuill, the other
the Vnciuill: the Ciuill
are Law-quarrels, the
vnciuil are Sword-quarrels.
The one is the
smooth-fac'd company,
the other the rugged or
ragged Regiment. The
citie of peace hath gates
for these also, when she
hath subdued them. Either
shee turnes them
out at Moore-gate, as
fitter for the societie of
Moores and Pagans; she
banisheth them. Or laies
them vp in New-gate; a

place very conuenient,
beeing not so olde as
peace, built since the
birth of strife. These enemies
pursue vs, vel ferro,
vel foro,
                  Aug. as that Father
saith.
               
                  Ferro,
                  The first Troupe. when vpon euery
punctilio of honor,
as they falsely call it,
Reason &amp; Religion must
be thrown by, and Fury
gouerne. The Gallant,
as if hee knew no Law
but his owne will, or as
if the least aspertion vpon
his honor were more
weighty, then if the state
of Christen dome, or the
glory of God lay vpon

it; cryes Reuenge, offers
the stab, threatens the
pistoll. How is that precious
account forgotten
which God requires of
man and beast!Gen. 9. 5. Men
study to bee mad with
reason, they haue an Art
of killing, that teaches
murther by the booke:
as cunning as Ioab was,
that could stabbe in the
fift rib,
                     
                        •
                      Sam. 3. 27. &amp; 20. 10. a speeding place:
so he treacherously slew
Abner and Amasa. O
that men should venture
their liues vpon one anothers
sword, as if they
had no soules to be ventured
vpon the sword of

Gods vengeance! That
he should bee held base,
who being challenged,
doth not write his mind
with a pen of steele, in
the inke of blood, on the
white paper of mans
life!
               Cannot the teares of
our Mother preuail with
vs, when seeing vs quarrell,
she sayes as Iocasta
aduised her two vnbrotherly
sonnes; Bella geri
placuit nullos habitura
triumphos. Or as Rebecca
said of her twinnes;Gen. 27. 45. 
                  Why
should I be depriued of you
both in one day? But if
our Mother cannot still

vs, our Father will part
vs: &amp; they whose soules
haue peace, shall be sent
to a prison where is no
peace: that seeing they
loue quarrels, they may
haue fighting enough
with infernall spirits.
But perhaps there bee
some who make no other
reckoning, resoluing
with him in the Orator,
Hodie coenabimus
apud Inferos: to night
wee will sup together in
hell. As it is reported
of two to haue fought
vnder the gallows: desperately
fore-casting,
that if the one were

there killed, the other
should there be hanged.
               By the toleration of
this Duel in France, that
kingdome lost in tenne
yeres six thousand Gentlemen;
as themselues
report. Wretched men!
for Occiser lethaliter peccat,
                  Bern.
                  &amp; occisus aeternaliter
perit: the homicide sins
deadly, and the slaine
(without vnexpectable
mercy) perisheth eternally.
How dare they
lift vp those hands to
God for mercy, that
haue beene lifted vp against
their brother in
cruelty? Euery base vermine

can kill,Aug. it is true
prowesse and honour to
giue life, and preserue it
Simeon and Leui seemed
to haue iust cause;Gen. 34. 31 the
Whoring of their owne
Sister:
                  Gen. 49. 6. yet their father
cals them brethren in euil
for it, blesseth his honor
from their company, &amp;
his soule from their secrecy.
Thou sayst of thy
contendent, he shal haue
as good as he brings, yet
thy self condemnest that
hee brings for euill.Basil. 
                  Ne
vtaris inimico praeceptore,
let not thy enemie
teach thee to due that,
which thy selfe detestest

in him. Because wee receiue
iniuries without
right, shall wee returne
them without law?
               Sometimes this ariseth
from the wine, Bacchus
ad arma vocat: and
lightly it makes men aptest
to vse their armes,
when they cannot stand
on their legges. But shall
this serue for a plea, and
get a pardon, it was
done in drinke? no, this
rather deserues a double
punishment, as it is a
double fault. Commonly
it proceeds from vnaduised
anger; as if any
thing done in fury, were

not done in folly. The
cholericke man is like
one that dwels in a thatched
house; who being
rich in the morning, by
a sodaine fire is a beggar
before night. It was
the decree of Theodosius,
by the counsell of S.
Ambrose; that execution
after a seuere sentence
should be deferred thirtie
dayes: that the heat
being qualified, the seueritie
might be moderated.
               But they obiect, This
is to stand by like fooles,
while wee suffer others
to abuse vs: no, that is

not folly, which the
Lord hath commended
for wisdome. The shot
of the Cannon hurts not
Wooll, and such yeelding
things; but that
which is hard, stubborne,
and resisting: the
rage of our roaring
sonnes is tamed by patience.
Turne to the
brawling curre, and hee
will be more fierce: ride
on neglecting him, and
he will soone be quiet.
This is the furious
Band.
               
                  Foro;
                  The other Troupe. there is another
Battalia of aduersaries
that turne their challenge

into a Writ; the
field appointed is Westminster
Hall, or some other
Court of Iustice:
the weapons, the Law:
the postures of the fight
are Demurres, Delayes,
Quirks, Remoouals: the
Victory, a Verdict: the
Doome, a Sentence: and
the death it selfe, an Execution.
One sayes, To
beare this, is against my
conscience: when indeed
hee meanes it is against
his concupiscēce.
If the Plaintife goe no
further then the Court
of his owne affections,
the defendant shal neuer

haue audience: for he is
Amicus Curiae.
                  Pro. 18. 17. 
                  He that is
first in his owne cause, seemeth
iust: but his neighbour
commeth, and searcheth
him: hee is no competent
Iudge in his own
matter. It will beare an
action, saith the Lawgiuer,
this enflameth
passion in the Law-goer.
               O that men could see
the folly of this litigiousnesse.
1. That hee is
not in the state of grace,
but a meere carnal man.
This is Saint Pauls argument
to the Corinthians;
If there be contentions
amongst you,

                  Are ye not carnall?
                  1. Cor. 3. 4. wheras
the Fruit of the Spirit
is Peace,
                  Gal. 5. 22. 
                  Long-suffering,
Gentlenesse. 2. That hee
doth not so much find,
as make himselfe enemies:
we may say of him
as the Angel said to Hagar
concerning her son
Ishmael;
                  Gen. 16. 12 
                  His hand is against
euery man, and euery
mans hand against him.
3. That he vexeth himselfe
without need: they
that goe to Law for trifles,
are like nice people
that continually lie in
the hands of Chirurgians,
and Phisicians, for
pimples &amp; warts: wheras

as the Physician and
Lawyer are for necessitie,
not wantonnesse.
Their boxes and papers
are the Books &amp; Badges
of their profession: they
trudge vp and downe,
more busie to cast away
their money, then Lawyers
are to catch it: their
word is Currat Lex, let
the law haue his course:
but by their willes that
course should neuer haue
an end.
               They plead, wee haue
stood before the best, in
Courts of highest honor:
alas, so doth the
spider,Pro. 30. 28. euen in kings palaces.
                  
So did the Deuill,
when the Sons of God
presented themselus before
him,Iob. 2. 1. Satan was ther
also. 4. They consider
not the root of contentions,
as the Apostle describes
them: want of
Wisdome to compound
controuersies; Is there
not one wise man among
you,
                  1 Cor. 6. 5. &amp;c. able to iudge betweene
brethren? Want
of loue, Brother is against
brother. Want of Patience;
Why do ye not rather
suffer wrong? Want of
Iustice; Ye defraud and do
wrong. For want of Iustice,
foro conscientiae, they

prosecute their malice,
foro Iustitiae. Wee may
add, want of Mercy, they
cannot forgiue: but if
they forgiue not others,
their finall Quietus est
was neuer yet sealed; and
they shal be called to an
after-reckoning. As that
wicked seruāt sped; notwithstanding
the Lord
forgaue him at his request,Mat. 18. 22
because he did not
forgiue his brother at
his intreaty, he was deliuered
ouer to the tormentors.
               
               Fiftly, they weigh not
how they are deceiued.
Lawyers first inuented

Lawes to secure our
lands and titles: now
they make those lawes
engines to get away our
lands and titles. Their
frequent Session hath
not beene euermore to
preserue a mans possession.
And for those that
can tarry the leasure of
the Lawe, they haue
quirks &amp; delayes: which
are like the corrosiue
plaisters of an vnconscinable
Leach, that turnes
a small greene wound to
an incurable Fistula, by
poysoning and exulceration
of it for filthy lucre.
When a man must

die without mercy, it is
some ease to die quickly,
and bee out of his
paine. But such, when
they purpose to murther
a mans estate, haue tricks
to keepe him long a dying:
that hee may still
languish and pine away
in hope of recouery.
               And what doth the
winner get, that at the
Tearmes end, hee may
bragge of his gaines?
Doth hee not come
home dry-founderd?
Doth he not follow the
Mill so long, till the toll
be more then the griest?
It is a token of vnwholsome

ayre, wher the coū
                  trey
is full of thriuing
Physitions: Sivaleant homines,
arstua, Phaebe, iacet.
It argues little health
in that kingdome, which
hath so many thriuing
Lawyers: who while
vnquietnesse feeds vs, do
quietly feed vpon vs.
               We are willing to giue
such self-molesters some
counsell, if they wil take
it, and aske them no fees
for it. Yea wee giue it
not, but Christ giues it:
wil they take his aduice,
that great Counseller of
the Father? He counsels
his clients to the euerlasting

possession of their
soules by patience. In Olympiacis
certaminibus,
Diabolo consecratis;
                  
                     
                        •
                     hysoft. In
the games of Olympus
consecrated to the Deuill,
hee had the glory
of the day, that gaue
most wounds, and came
off himselfe vntouched.
In stadio Christi non est ea
certādi lex, sed contraria:
In the race of Christianitie,
there is a contrary
Law of striuing: not he
that offers most blowes,
but hee that suffers most
blowes, is crowned. A
man is stricken, will hee
goe to law for this? no,

rather let him turne the
other cheeke; this is
Christs counsell. His
cloke is taken from him,
it is neere him a garment;
of necessary comlinesse,
a cloke: of singular
vse, hee hath but
one cloke: hee hath the
proprietie of it, it is his
cloke: must hee goe to
Law for this? no, rather
let him take his coat also.
Foelix ille, si nudus
corpore, sit nudus malicia:
there is a wedding
garment to cloth such.
               I am no Anabaptist,
nor Libertine, to deny
the Magistracie, or lawfulnes

of authoritie, and
our iust appeale thereto.
Rather then euery
man should be his owne
Iudge, I would appease
vprores with the Town-clerke
of Ephesus; The
Law is open,
                  Act. 19. 38. 
                  and there are
Deputies, let them implead
one another. Saint
Paul himselfe took this
course, appealing to the
Iudgment seat of Caesar.
                  Act 25. 10.
Our Sauiours practise is
a cleere Comment and
declaration of his Law:
hee that bade vs rather
turne out other checke
to the smiter, then reuenge
our selues; did

himself sweetly reproue
him that smote him.Iohn 18. 23 
                  If
I haue spoken euill, beare
witnesse of the euill: but
if well, why smitest thou
mee? So Paul to Ananias,
                  Sittest thou to iudge
me after the Law,
                  Act. 23. 3. 
                  &amp; commandest
mee to be smitten
contrary to the Law? The
Lord himselfe hath appoynted
Tribunals: and
no law, no loue. I know
there is a Christianly
seeking of Iustice, when
iniurious persons grow
worse by forbearance,
and ground their insolence
vpon others patience.
As Christians may

warre in loue, so they
may iarre in loue: when
the partie cast in the
suit, may be bettered, if
not in his money, yet in
his manners; and Satan
onely conquered. Vt qui
vincitur, simul vincat, &amp;
vnus tantummodo vincatur
diabolus. Sed reprimā
me, I will hold me where
I was. I haue laboured
to bring men into peace,
I must shew them no
way out againe. The Fathers
sometimes in confuting
an Heresie much
spread; if they did runne
a little within the brinks
of a contrary error, not

then questioned, nor so
dangerous; were neuer
censured for that to
haue erred Dogmaticè.
So if to conuince that
Heresie in maners, (It is
lawfull to go to law for
euery thing;) I should a
little leane to and fauor
that other opinion, (It is
lawfull to goe to law for
nothing;) either excuse
mee, or at least suspend
your iudgements, till I
come on purpose to
handle that poynt. If
men would promise not
to goe to Law till then,
I would promise, when
they did goe to Law, to

beare all their charges.
               Howsoeuer, let them
not doe it animo litigandi,
nor for euery wrong
enter an action, lest God
enter his action against
them.Hos. 4. 1. 
                  The Lord hath a
controuersie with the Inhabitants
of the land: a
terrible action, which
the Iury of heauen and
earth wil find. Let them
therefore leaue all, and
study Gods Law, with
that royall Prophet; Thy
Testimonies are my delight
and my Counsellers:
                  Psal. 119. 24. 48.
and I will meditate in thy
Statutes. Blessed is hee
that meditates on Gods

Law day and night:
                  Psal. 1. 2. but
cursed is he that wastes
his time to meditate and
study Law-trickes. Let
the litigious soule learne
a new course of law: let
Conscience be his Chancery,
Charity his Chancelor,
Patience his Counseller,
Truth his Atturney,
and Peace his Sollicitor.
Litem in proximum, diuertat
in seipsum. Let
him go to Law with his
owne heart; arraigne his
passionat will at the Bar
of Gods Iudgement; let
the twelue Apostles bee
a Iury against him, who
all condemned Contention.

Thus let him iudge
himselfe, that he be not
iudged of Iesus Christ.
For he that auengeth his
owne quarrell, steps into
the Princes Chaire of
Estate, yea into Gods
owne Seat; dethroning
both; and so disturbes
neauen and earth. Mad
men, that thus presume,
as if God did not see
malice in the heart!Pro 
                        •
                     5. 11 
                  Hell
and destruction are before
the Lord, much more then
the hearts of the children
of men. Or as if seeing
men contend, he had nothing
to do with it: but
must sit still like an idle

looker on, and take part
with neither.
               
                  Dearly beloued,
                  Rom. 12. 19. 
                  auenge
not your selues, but rather
giue place vnto wrath: for
it is written, Vengeance is
mine, I will repay, saith
the Lord. This sounds a
Retreat to all quarrels:
Paul seeing the Daggers
drawen, and the peace in
danger to bee broken;
steps in with the sword
of the Spirit, to part the
fray. It is a Writ of Reuersment
from the high
Court of heauen: if we
break open the writ, we
shall find the Kings pleasure
in it; an Arrest of

reuengers. Hee begins
with Dearely beloued; a
sweet ingredience, to
qualifie a bitter medicine.
As if he should say,
It is my loue that I write
so much against malice:
not for your hurt, but
for your eternal good: if
you wil not beleeue me,
beleeue God himself:Deu. 32. 35 
                  To
me belongeth vengeance.
               
               The Deuill when hee
gets audience, tels a man
how much hee is hated
of others: the holy Spirit
tels him how much
hee is loued of others.
The argument of our
charity to them, is Gods

charitie to vs. Put on (as
the elect of God,
                  Col. 3. 12 
                  holy and
beloued) bowels of mercies,
kindnes, humblenes of
mind, long suffering: seeing
you are beloued of
God, loue his.
               This is Gods chalenge,
Vengeance is mine: Gods
execution, I will repay:
Gods Subscription, to
which his great Name
is affixed, Thus saith the
Lord. Scriptum est, it is
a transcript and faithfull
copy out of the Originall,
to shew it the Lords
true act and deed: twice
written, that it might neuer
be forgotten. Once

hath God spoken, twice
haue I heard it,
                  Psal. 62. 11 
                  that Vengeance
(so well as Power)
belongeth vnto God. Hee
pleads the continuance
of Succession without
interruption; vengeance,
Iudgement, and Glory
are His alone. Therefore
to auenge our selues, is
both to lose Gods protection,
and to incurre
his condemnation. It is
faithlesse and fruitlesse:
faithlesse, not to beleeue
that God wil deale with
vs according to his
Word.Psal. 91. 8. 
                  With thine eyes
thou shalt see the reward
of the wicked. It is then

infidelitie not to commit
our case to God, and
his Deputie the Prince;
but to make them both
our deputies and instruments
of reuenge. What
is this but to exalt our
selues aboue all that is
called God; and to play
the Deuil in iest, and the
Pope in good earnest?
Fruitlesse, for if being
wronged, we draw out
our woodden dagger of
reuenge, God wil put vp
his sword, and leaue vs
to our selues. The iniured
child turnes not againe,
but runs to his father.
When the Italians

heare how God hath reserued
Vengeance to
himselfe, they say blasphemously,
He knew it
was too sweet a bit for
man, therefore kept it
for his owne tooth. But
if man were is owne
caruer, he would carue
too deepe. God onely is
wise and iust, wise to
know, &amp; iust to giue the
due proportion. Now
the Great and Omnipotent
Lord chiefe Iustice,
bind vs all to the
peace on earth, and
bring vs all to the peace
of heauen.
               
                  
Now because euery
Citie must haue an established
Gouernment;
Order being the good
of euery creature, &amp; it is
better not to be, then to
be out of order: therefore
this Citie of Peace
must haue a Lord, and a
Law: a Ruler to gouerne
it, and a Rule whereby it
must be gouerned. The
King is Christ, who is
therfore called Princeps
Pacis, The Prince of
Peace. And hee hath a
Deputie or Vicegerent
vnder him, whom hee
hath set to promoue the
good, and to remoue the

euill, of Peace. The Law
is Truth, that is the Gospell,
Regula Pacis, the
Rule of Truth.
            
            
               The Gouernour of
this Citie
               Is supreme Authoritie:
                  The King of Peace.
as God is a great King,
so the king is (as it were)
a little God. I haue said,
Yee are Gods. God is an
inuisible King, the King
is a visible god.Rom. 13. 5. 
                  Ye must
bee subiect, not onely for
wrath, but also for Conscience
sake. All must obey:
the bad for feare, the
good for loue. To compell
the one, there is a

Writ out of the Kings
Bench: to perswade the
other, there is a motion
in the Chancery.
               
               Of all Nations we are
blessed with peace, vnder
a King of peace:
therefore all bound to
bee children of peace.
There are three wayes
of chusing Kings. 1. An
immediate nomination
from God. 2. A Succession
of blood. 3. An
election of the people.
The first ceaseth, the last
hath been found dangerous,
the best remaines.
They that are suddenly
chosen out of the flock,

doe seldome manifest
such royall behauiour,
nor become their Maieiestie;
for it is not their
Trade. Iehu remitted
much of his noble zeale,
when hee was setled in
his kingdome. It is one
thing to say, With a great
summe of money,
                  Acts 22. 28 
                  obtained
I this kingdome: and for
another to say, I was a
King borne. Wee may
iustly say of our King,
Dignissimus Regno, si non
natus ad Regnum. When
the Poets called some
men the Sonnes and offspring
of the gods; they
meant that they were

men of a more noble
and vncommon nature:
and that those graces
were, Ex Diuino afflatu.
It was as familiar with
Homer, to make a King
fight with a god at his
elbowe, as a common
Souldier with his sword
in his hand. To whom
the Lord giues most honour,
he giues most assistance.
The heart of the
King is in his hand, as riuers
of waters; the heart
of a priuate man as a little
brook: in the former
is more need of his omnipotence.
Howsoeuer,
the grace of adoption, in

the Apostles time,1 Cor. 1. 26 was
not giuen to many mightie
or noble; yet the graces
of administration are.
               Anarchie is the mother
of diuision, the stepmother
of peace. While
the State of Italy wants
a King, all runnes into
ciuill broiles. It is the
happinesse of this Citie,
that there is no distraction.
Not a King at
Iudah, and another at
Dan: not one in Hebron,
another in Gibeon: not
the redd Rose here, and
the white there. We are
not shuffled into a popular
gouernment, nor cut

into Cantons, by a
headles, headstrong Aristocracie:
but Henricus
Rosas, Regna Iacobus: in
Henry was the vnion of
Roses, in Iames of the
kingdomes. Euery King
is not a Peace-maker;
ours, like a second Augustus,
hath shut the rustie
doore of Ianus Temple;
so making Peace, as
if hee were made of
peace. That blessed
Queene of sweete and
sacred memory before
him, was Filia Pacis:
who, as by her Sexuall
graces shed deserued to
bee the Queene of women,

so by her masculine
vertues to bee the
Queen of men. Certenly,
it would haue troubled
any King but Him,
to haue succeeded such
a Queene; yet no man
complaines the want of
peace. This hee promised,
and Verbum Regis,
Rex Regi, this hee hath
perfourmed to euery
good soules content.
When he was first proclaimed,
what heard we
but peace? What heard
the Nobles? a King that
would honour them.
What the Senators? a
King that would counsell

them. What the
Schooles? a King that
would grace thē. What
the Diuines? a King that
would encourage them.
What the rich? a King
that would defend thē.
What the poore? a
King that would relieue
them.
               When a Tyrant comes
abroad, all seeke to hide
themselues:Pro. 28. 28 
                  When the
wicked rise, men hide
themselues. But when a
clement Prince progresseth,
all flock to him, the
streets and wayes are filled
with people, the aire
with acclamations. We

call our peace, the Kings
peace: and say to brawlers,
Keepe the Kings
peace. Peace, Plentie,
Trafficke, Learning, Administration
of Iustice,
flourishing of arts, preaching
of the Gospell,
Rex Iupiter omnibus idem.
Like Dauid, hee
leads the Dance to heauen:
and like Augustus,
makes a sweet spring
wheresoeuer hee goes.
Israel had rest fortie yeres,
we haue had a Iubile of
fiftie yeares, and begun
againe.Iudg. 5. 31 The Peace-maker
doth both blesse, and
is blessed: therefore let

vs blesse him, and blesse
God for him, and hold
our selues blessed in
him.
               Away then with those
discontented spirits, that
grudge these outward
rights, whether tributes
of money, or attributes
of Supremacie. Soluatur
subsidium, ne contingat
excidium. For this cause
pay wee tribute also, &amp;c.
                  Rom. 13. 6
It is the mediate due to
God, as prayers &amp; praises
are his immediate
rents. Some haue obserued,
that Christ did no
miracle about Honor or
money, except that one

of giuing tribute to Caesar.
                  Mat. 17. 27
Much more intolerable
are those our Cosens
of Samaria, that fly
off in a rage; What portion
haue wee in Dauid?
For this cause certainly,
if Dauid were now a
liue, he would neuer admit
a Iesuit to his Chaplaine.
But perish his enemies,
and vpon his own
Head let his Crowne
flourish. May not the
Scepter depart from Iacob,
nor a Seed from his
loynes, till Shiloh come
againe. May his Posteritie
haue a Crowne on
earth, when himselfe

hath a crown in heauen.
Amen.
            
            
               The Law of this Citie
               Is the Gospel of Christ:The Lavv of Peace.
a law indeed, but a law
of peace. It made peace
betwixt God and man,
and it must make peace
betweene man and man.
If it cannot reconcile vs
one to another, it shall
reconcile none of vs to
the Lord. It is a lawe,
not to bee obserued for
State, but for Conscience.
Indeed those Catuli
Catilinarij, Statising
Iesuites, turne all their
Religion into Statisme,

yea into Atheisme. And
there be many Church-Recusants,
a monstrous,
menstruous brood, the
Moone-calues of that
lunatick religion. Come
they doe, but more for
feare of the Law, then
for loue of the Gospell.
And al the children that
euen hang on the brests
of peace, cannot be excused:
for some through
nescience or negligence,
scarce cast an eye on the
statutes of peace.
               
                  I will heare what the
Lord will speake:
                  Psal. 85. 8 
                  for hee
will speake peace vnto his
people. One takes snuffe

at his poore neighbour;
perhaps it is Mordecai's
cap that hath put Haman
out of his princely
wits: and now hee resolues
to trounce him:
proud beggar! Hee will
teach him to knowe his
betters. O but tarry, and
heare the Statute of
Peace.Pro. 22. 22. 
                  Rob not the poore
because hee is poore: for
the Lord will pleade
his cause, and spoyle
the soule of them that
spoile him. Lust makes
this a spurre to opression,
Quia pauper,
because hee is poore:
the Law makes this a

bridle from it, Quia pauper,
because he is poore.
Another is erop-sicke of
Ceremonies; hee hath a
toy in his head, that
the Churches garment
should not bee embroydered,
nor haue more
lace and fringe then his
owne coat: there is in
him so little of man, that
he talkes of nothing but
the Beast. Rather then
his children shall bee
crossed in Baptisme, hee
will out of the Arke into
some fantasticall Wherry.
Let him tarry, and
heare what the Lord
speakes, in his Law of

peace.Gal. 6. 15. 
                  In Christ Iesus
neither Circumcision auayleth
anything, nor vncircumcision,
but a New
creature. That is, neither
Ceremony, nor no Ceremony,
but the Substantiall;
a new Creature.
               Another flatters himselfe;
I need not stand on
strict performance of
Tythes, the Gospell requires
nothing but Beneuolence:
experienced
men iustifie it, I haue the
warrant of good Lawyers
for it. O but such
a Lawyer is the Barrister
of Barathrum, a

sworne enemy to the
law of peace. The voice
of Christ is not in it,
heare that. Let him that
is taught in the word,
                  Gal. 6. 6
                  communicate vnto him
that teacheth, in all good
things.
               
               This City of Peace
hath one immutable
Rule, and it is sufficient
to direct all actions. And
as many as walke according
to this Rule,
                  Gal. 6, 16 
                  peace be
on them, and mercy, and
vpon the Israell of God. A
man is proud of his
victorious mischiefes,
flesh'd with his fortunat
wickednesse; thinkes he

hath carried himselfe
brauely, in out-bribing
his aduersary, fooling
Iudge and Iury by false
testimony, and triumphs
in his vnblest gain; but is
this according to the rule
of Peace. Vincat veritas,
let Truth ouercom. The
loser may sit down with
content, but the winner
shall ye down in tormēt.
A rich man carries himselfe
proudly,; aboue
others in scorne, aboue
himselfe in folly: hee
thinkes all his Titles beneath
him, and euen
those that worship him,
still to vnderualue him:

others hee lookes vpon,
as if they were made to
serue him, yea, and bee
proud to bee commanded
by him. Crosse him,
and hee rages, swelles,
foames, like the Sea in
a storme: but is this after
the Rule of Peace?Mat. 11. 29
                  Learne of mee who am
meeke and lowly in heart.
Alas, what is the difference
in dust? The Beggar
dies,
                  Luk. 16. 22 
                  so doth the rich
man. Before, the rich
could not endure the
beggar neere him, here
one verse containes thē
both. In life the rich
hath the preheminence

of ease, and wealth, and
honour: in death the
poore man goes first to
peace.
               In driuing a trade, it is
Mammons prime policy,
to take aduantage of
others necessitie, or simplicity.
Sold you it for
so much?
                  Acts 5. 8. Saith Peter:
For so much, answers
Ananias. Did it cost
so much? sayes the buyer:
yes, saith the seller.
Let him tremble at the
Iudgement, which was
a sudden death. This is
the Rule of an vniust Citie,
not of the Citie of
Peace. Pereat mundi

lucrum, ne fia
                        •
                      animae
damnum. Perish that
gaine which comes with
the soules losse.
               Many thinke Charity
to the poore, to bee a
worke of meere Supererogation;
that they
are not bound liberally
to giue part of that to
lasie beggars, which
they haue laboriously
gotten by their endeauours.
But heare the
Rule of Peace; Breake
thy bread vnto the hungry;
                  Sell that thou hast,
                  Mat. 19. 21
                  and giue to the poore.
But as when Christ disswaded
from Couetice,

by the difficultie of entrance
that wealth finds
to heauen, they amazedly
replied, Who then can
be saued? Who can walk
after this Rule? When
we preach this doctrine,
the world cries, Durus
Sermo, this is a hard saying,
a harsh Sermon. Yet
is this the law of peace,
and thus minded are the
citizens of peace. When
the poore at your gates
aske you Panem quotidinum,
their daily bread;
they after a sort make
you gods; therfore shew
your selues at least to be
men. Charitie is the

food of Peace on earth,
and the Seed of peace in
heauen.
            
            
               The Palace of Peace
               Is the Temple:
                  The Court or Palace of Peace. the
peace of man can neuer
bee preserued without
the worship of God. It is
not enough for the citie
to haue lawes, but these
must be diuulged, made
knowen to the Inhabitants;
the obseruation
of them continually vrged:
for by nature men
are apt enough to flye
out. Howsoeuer the Romans
built their Templū
Pacis without the gates,
yet heere it is the chiefe

honor and ornament of
the Citie. Heere Peace
keepsher Court, and sits
like a royall Queene in
her Chaire of Estate.
Which is not like Solomons
Throne, guarded
with Lyons; but with
milke-white Doues, and
couered ouer with Oliue
branches.
               But alas! how doth
her Palace now fall to
ruine for want of reparation?
Few there bee
that repaire it, but to impaire
it thousands are
ready. The question was
once;1 Sam. 9. 7 
                  What shall we bring
to the man of God? Now

it is a motion suffered in
all Courts, What shall
we take away from the
man of God? The noble
Shunamite built him
a chamber, with a bed
and a candlesticke: We
haue those that pull
downe his roomes, disturbe
his rest, and put
out his light. Nehemiah
reduced the Tythes to
the primitiue institution
and order: But if any
Nehemiah should now
vndertake it, and restore
our portion to our own
hands; there are tenne
thousand Harpies ready
to catch it ere it come

to our mouthes. Wee
may sing, or rather sigh
one to another, as little
children chaunt in the
streets: When shall we
eat white Bread? When
the Puttock is dead:
when there is not a Sacrilegious
Lawyer left. If
the walls of Ierusalem
should beginne to rise,
there is a Tobiah or Samballat
to flout vs,Neh. 4. 3. that a
Fox is able to breake them
downe. Corrupt Aduocates
are those Foxes,
and by their wills the
Vine of Peace should
beare no Grapes that ecape
their fingers. Some

haue written wittily in
the praise of folly, some
haue commended Baldnesse;
other in a quaint
Paradoxe extolled deformity:
but in former
times it was neuer
heard that any wrote
Encomiums of Sacrilege.
               
               That the Kings of the
earth should conspire against
Christ,Psal. 2. 2. it was no
wonder:1 Cor. 2. 8 for they knew
him not.
                  Psal. 13. 6. That the Edomites
and Ishmaelites
should oppose him,Acts 4. 27 no
wonder: for they stood
on termes of hostilitie.
That the Iewes should
confederat against him,

no wonder: for they hated
him. But that men
baptized in his Faith,
bearing his Name as
their honourable Title,
and wearing his Profession,
as their chiefe ornament;
should consent
to rob him, and iustifie
it by their law! this is
such a thing as the very
Barbarians would blush
at. Suppose the Ministers
of this Citie, the
Pencioners of Peace, by
some humble complaint
request their owne, or
(at most but) so me small
part of their owne; is the
Spoyler at a non-plus?

Cannot hee finde an
Aduocate to plead for
him, and make his cause
(though not be, yet) appeare
good? What, not
one for his fees, that can
cry downe the Temple,
the Gospell, Christ
himselfe? Is there no
Bill to bee framed? no
false plea to bee found?
Is Sathan turn'd foole?
Hath none of his schollers
any braines left?
Yes, we might think the
deuil were dead, if there
could not bee found an
Aduocate to plead for
Sacriledge. The Lord
in his Iustice for sinne,

                  hath broken downe her
hedges;
                  Psal. 80. 12 and now euery
hand hath a snatch at
her Grapes.
               
               In many places, Ahab-
like, they haue engrossed
the whole vineyard:
but if the poore, exposed,
&amp; vnsupported Vine
be left, it shall beare the
owner but a few grapes.
This may hold in Iure
Fori, it neuer shall hold
in Iure Poli. God promised
that the faith of the
Church should remoue
mountaines: such were
Domitian, Dioclesian,
and those Imperiall persecutors.
The Church

prayes, Dorsum corum
incurua, Bow downe their
backes; and so the Lord
did. Valerian was so
bowed downe, that hee
became a footstoole for
the King of Persia, to
mount vp to his horse
O that the Church of
Peace had still this miraculous
Faith, to remoue
these mountaines;
malicious and truth-hating
pleaders, the pioners
of the Temple, and
the maintainers of those
that pillage it.
               They tell vs, the Law
is open, and there be deputies;
                  Acts 19. 38
but who be the deputies

in this Citie? Is
there any other then a
Iudge of their owne?
And is it not then a prouerbiall
answere of any
man questioned in this
Sacriledge; Aske my father
if I bee a theefe?
When Dauid decided
the matter to Mephibosheth;
                  Thou and Ziba diuide
the land:
                  2 Sam. 19. 30. he answered,
Yea let him take all:
For the misery of Law,
I neuer by experience
found it, because I neuer
tried it: but when they
haue leaue to diuide the
Inheritance of Christ
with their Ministers (and

it were somthing tolerable
if they did but diuide
it) I say, yea let thē take
all, seeing all they will
haue, rather then we go
to recouer it by such a
Iudgement. But certenly
God cannot long abide
to see that people
prosper, who cannot abide
to see his Church
prosper. They that spoil
the Palace of Peace on
earth, shall neuer be entertained
into her glorious
Court of heauen.
            
            
               The Riuer that serues
this Citie of Peace
               Is Prosperitie.
                  The Riuer of this Citie. It is one

principall happinesse of
a Citie, to bee scituated
by a Riuers side: that as
it hath fortified it selfe
by land, so it may haue
commaund of the Sea.
Prosperitie is the Riuer
to this Citie, that like a
louing Meander, winds
it selfe about, throwing
his siluer Armes vpon
her sides; ebbing slowly,
but flowing merrily, as
if he longed to embrace
his loue. Peace is the
mother of Prosperitie,
but Prosperitie is too
often the murtherer of
Peace. For peace breeds
wealth, wealth breedes

pride, pride breeds contention,
and contention
kils peace. Thus shee is
often destroyed by her
owne issue, as Senacherib
was by his owne bowels.
               Take this Citie wee
liue in for an Instance.
Peace hath brought
Gods plentie: the Inhabitants
neither plowe,
nor sowe, nor reape; yet
are fed like the fowles
of heauen. They fare
well with lesse trouble,
then if come grewe at
their doores, and cattell
grased in their streets.
But as Nylus may rise

too high, and water Egypt
too much; so the
inundation of opulency
may doe thē hurt. Thus
may the influence of
heauen, and the plentie
of earth, be a Snare vnto
vs; and our abundance,
an occasion of our falling.
Prosperitie is heartie
meat, but not digestible
by a weake stomack,
strong wine, but naught
for a weake braine. The
prosperitie of fooles destroyeth
them.
                  Pro. 1, 32 It is not
simply prosperitie, but
the prosperitie of fooles
that destroyeth them.
The swelling Riuer by

the surfet of a Tyde,
doth not sooner bring
in our encrease; but our
encrease doth breed in
our minds another swelling,
in our bodies another
surfeting: we swell
in pride, and surfet in
wantonnesse. The Israelites
neuer fared so
well, as when they liued
at Gods immediate finding;
and at night expected
their morrowes
breakfast frō the clouds.
When they did daily
aske, and daily receiue
their daily bread.
               There be (as I heard
a worthy Diuine obserue)

three maine Riuers
in the land, whereof
this is held the best:
and this Citie is placed
in the best Seate of the
Riuer, vpon the gentle
rising of a hill, in the
best ayre, and richest
soyle. When a Courtier
gaue it out, That
Queene Mary being displeased
with the Citie,
threatned to diuert both
Tearme and Parliament
to Oxford: an Alderman
asked whether shee
meant to turne the chanell
of the Thames thither,
or no▪ if not, saith
hee, by Gods grace we

shall doe well enough.
The lines are fallen to vs
in pleasant places,
                  Psal. 16. 6 
                  wee
haue a goodly Heritage.
Both the Elements are
our friends; the Earth
sends vs in her fruites,
the Sea her merchandise.
Wee are neere enough
the benefits, and
farre enough from the
dangers of the Ocean.
Nothing is wanting to
the consummation of
our happinesse: to keepe
vs in our owne Countrey,
in our owne Citie,
in our owne Houses,
but that which keepes
men in their wits, Temperance,

and Thankfulnesse.
               But doe wee not requite
this Riuer of Prosperitie,
with vngrateful
impietie? and vse the
Ocean of Gods bountie,
as wee doe the
Thames? It brings vs
in all manner of prouision;
Clothes to couer
vs, Fuell to warme vs,
Food to nourish vs,
Wine to cheare vs,
Gold to enrich vs: and
we in recompense, foile
it with our rubbish, filth,
common sewers, &amp; such
excretions. It yeeldes
vs all manner of good

things, and we requite
it with all plentie of bad
things. It comes flowing
in with our commodities,
&amp; we send it loaden
backe with our iniuries.
               Such toward God is
the impious ingratitude
of this famous Citie,
which else had no Paralell
vnder the Sunne.
Shee may not vnfitly
bee compared to certaine
Pictures, that represent
to diuers beholders,
at diuers stations,
diuers formes. Looking
one way, you see a
beautifull Virgine: another
way, some deformed

monster. Cast an
eye vpon her Profession,
shee is a well grac'd
creature: turne it vpon
her conuersation, shee is
a mishapen stigmaticke.
View her Peace, shee
is fayrer then the daughters
of men: viewe her
Pride, the children of
the Hittites and Amorites
are beautious to
her. Think of her good
works, then Blessed art
thou of the Lord: number
her sinnes, then How
is that faithfull Citie become
an harlot 
                        〈…〉
                     
                  
                  Esa. 1. 21. To tell
of her Charitie, and
how many hundreds she

feedes in a yeare, you
will say with Paul, In
this I praise her. To tell
of her oppressions, and
how many thousands
shee vndoes in a yeare,
you will say with him
againe, In this I praise
her not. Behold her like
a Nourse drawing her
Brests, and giuing milke
to Orphans, you wish
her Cup to runne ouer
with fulnesse. Behold
her like a Horse leech,
sucking the blood of the
Church, to feede her
owne sacrilegious auarice;
you will say her
Cup is too full. When

wee thinke of her prosperitie,
wee wonder at
her impietie: when we
thinke of her impietie,
wee wonder at her prosperitie.
O that her Citizens
would learne to
mannage their liberall
fortunes, and to entertaine
the Riuer of Peace
that makes glad the Citie
of God, with Humilitie
and Sobrietie. That
when Death shall disfranchise
them heere,
they may be made free
aboue, in that tryumphant
Citie, whose glory
hath neither measure,
nor end.
            
            
               
               The Life of the
Citizens
               Is Loue:
                  The life of Peace. for without
the loue of men there
can be no peace of God,
and there is no loue of
God in them that desire
not peace with men.
He that loues not the
members, was neuer a
friend to the Head. To
say we loue Christ, and
hate a Christian; is as
if a man, while hee was
saluting or protesting
loue to his freind, should
tread on his toes. I
know indeed, that euery
creature is to bee loued,
but in ordine ad Deum:
                  
Religion doth not forbid,
but rectifie our affections.
Our Parents,
spouses, children, allies,
countrymen, neighbors,
friends; haue all their
due places in our loue:
and it were a brutifh doctrine
to dispossesse vs
of these humane relations.
Onely they must
know their orders and
stations, and by no
meanes vsurpe vpon
God: they must not be
mistresses, but handmaides
to the loue of
Christ.
               But let vs loue them,
because they loue God:

as reflections of our
sight, which glaunce
from the Lord vpon his
Image: if God haue
their hearts, let them
haue our hearts. It is
poore to loue a man for
that is about him: hee
must bee loued for that
is within him. If wee
should account of men
as we doe of bagges;
prize them best that
weigh heauiest, and
measure out our loue by
the Subsidie-booke; honouring
a man because
he is well cloathed: I
see then no reason, but
wee should doe greater

reuerence to the Bason
and Euer on the stall,
then to the Goldsmith
in the Shop; and most
humbly salute Sattin &amp;
Veluet in whole pieces,
because their virgin-glory
was neuer yet rauished
and abused into fashion.
               No, but especially let
vs loue others, because
they feare God, and
serue Iesus Christ. For
as the braine is to the
sinewes, the liuer to the
veines, and the heart to
the arteries; so is Gods
loue to humane societies:
as the very soule

by which they liue, and
the forme that giues
them being. Otherwise
our companies are conspiracies;
when we fall
in one with another, to
fall out with God. Let
vs beginne our loues aboue,
deriuing this holy
fire from the Altar of
Heauen; let our faith
inkindle it at the heart
of Christ, and then like
the Cherubins, wee shall
looke graciously one vpon
another, while all
faithfully looke vp to
the Mercy-seate of
God.
            
            
               
               The generall State
of this Citie.
               This is the Corollary
of all;The Estate. euery particular
being cast vp, heere is
the summe; her vniuersall
felicitie. For the illustration
whereof, it
will not bee vnusefull,
to borrow an instance:
and wee need not trauell
farre to seeke out
such an image or resemblance.
               Looke wee vpon our
owne Nation, the happy
Module of this Citie
of peace. It was sayd,
that in Rome a man
might see all Countries:

and the Romans vsed
to solace themselues; It
is good looking on a Map
of the World, vbi nihil
in orbe videmus alienum,
when wee find nothing
in the world which is
not our owne. What
doth the whole earth
produce, which is not
yeelded to our enioying?
What was once
sayd of Ormus, is true
of this Citie, Turne the
world into a Ring, and
this is the Diamond
of it. Like to Gideons
Fleece, it hath been wet
with the dewe of heauen,
when drought was

on the whole earth besides:
Or like Nylus,
which keeps within the
Bankes, when other Riuers
ouerflow their continents.
Some Nations
haue peace, but without
the Truth: other
haue the Trueth, but
without Peace: wee
haue both Truth and
Peace. Our neighbours
haue beene exercised
with troubles, whirled
about with hostile tumults;
their eares affrighted
with the thunder
of those murdering
pieces: their eyes agashed
with their Temples

and Tabernacles flaming
about their heads:
Infants bleeding vpon
the stones, and their amazed
mothers rauished
ere they can bee
permitted to die. The
shrikes of the dying, and
slauery of the liuing, vnder
the mercilesse hands
of a killing or insulting
aduersary; these haue
beene their distracting
obiects: none of them
come neere vs. There
is no rifling of houses,
no flying to refuges, no
rotting in Dungeons,
no ruinating of Monuments,
no swelling the

chanels with blood, no
fiering of Cities, no
Rapes of Virgines, no
dashing of Babes against
the stones, nor casting
them, as they droppe
from their mothers
wombes, into their mothers
flames. But in
stead of these, the truth
of the Gospell is preached,
pietie professed,
the practise of it encouraged;
Grace promising,
and Peace performing,
blessed rewards.
               That is verified in vs,
which is recorded of
the dayes of Solomon;
That hee had peace on all

sides round about him:
                  1. Kings 4. 25.
                  and Iudah &amp; Israel dwelt
safely, euery man vnder
his Vine, and vnder his
Figgetree, from Dan to
Beersheba. Or as Syluius
sayd of Rhodes; Semper
in sole sita est. The Sunshine
of mercy embraceth
vs, and hath made
vs a day of peace, not
shorter then sixty yeres:
the fauours of God ouer
shadowing vs, as the
Cherubins did the Mercie-Seat.
I know that
Rome frets at this, and
let the Harlot rage her
heart out: shee thunders
out Curses, but

(praised bee God) wee
neuer more prospered,
then when the Pope
most cursed vs. Yea, O
Lord, thogh they curse,
doe thou blesse: their
thunder doth more fear
then hurt, thy fauour
doth more good then
they can blast. Conuert
or confound them that
haue euill will at Sion:
&amp; still let vs inherit thy
Peace, that thou mayst
inherit our praise.
               This is the Reward of
Peace, and of all those
that in sincerity of heart
loue her:2. Cor. 13. 11. 
                  the God of peace
shall be with them. There

be six kinds of peace, but
the peace of God containes
all the rest. The
peace of God passeth all vnderstanding:
therefore
whosoeuer looseth this
peace, hath a losse past
all vnderstanding. But
Christ foretold vs, that
in the world wee shall haue
no peace.
                  Ioh. 16. 33. Indeed no peace
Quoad oppositionem seculi,
yet much peace quoad
dispositionē Domini. The
most sauage disturbers,
Si non reformentur ne pereant,
tamen reprimentur
ne perimant: if they bee
not reformed to saue thē
themselues, they shall be

restrained from harming
vs. If they will not do vs
the good they should,
yet they shall not doe vs
the euill they would. Vel
inimieus tuus non manebit,
vel non manebit inimicus.
Either our enemies
shall not liue, or they
shall not liue our enemies.Psal. 58. 1
                        •
                     .
Either the righteous
shal reioyce whē they see the
vengeance, and wash their
feet in the blood of the wicked.
Or the Lord wil giue
them fauour in the sight of
their enemies,
                  Exod. 11. 3 
                  and those
that hated them, shall
cleaue vnto them.
               
               From hence ariseth

peace with our selues: a
conformitie of affection
to reason, of reason to
grace: that the conflicts
which a distressed conscience
finds with legall
terrors, shall bee turned
to mild embracements.
Faith leading the vnderstāding,
the vnderstāding
guiding the wil, the will
ruling the operatiue powers,
&amp; Christ Iesus gouerning
all. For indeed
hee is the Fountaine of
peace,Rom. 5. 1. and wee through
him beeing iustified by
faith, haue peace with God.
Through the corruption
of our nature, and Iustice

of Gods nature, we
are enemies: and there
is no reconciliation, but
through the blood o
the euerlasting Couenant.
He reconciles vs to
God, as Ioab did Absolon
to Dauid by the woman
of Tekoah: when the
whole family rose vp, &amp;
said, Deliuer him that
smote his brother,
                  2 Sam. 14 7 
                  that wee
may take his life for the
life of the slaine: and so
the father &amp; mother shal
haue no name nor remainder
vpon earth. God hath
two sorts of sons Angels
&amp; men: the Angels that
fel, are lost for euer: men

fel, if they were lost too,
where should God haue
sonnes? I know that he
needs not man: he hath
stil the elect Angels, and
is able to raise sonnes of
stones: he can want nothingwhile
he possesseth
himself. Wel, yet in mercy
Christ reconciles vs:
Dauid askes,Verse 19. 
                  Is not the
hand of Ioab in all this?
so we may admire, Is not
the hād of Iesus in all this?
Yes, hee hath made our
peace. The Minister alwayes
ends his publicke
deuotions with the peace
of God, &amp; the blessing of
this Peace rest vpon vs.
               
                  
Thus wee haue a reall
abridgment of this mystical
Citie of Peace; happy
euery way. Vigilancie
is her Officer of Peace;
that hath an eye in the
darkest angles, and discouers
the first conceptions
of strife. Discipline
is her Clerke of the
peace, that keepes the
Records, and indicts offenders.
Authoritie is
her Iustice of peace: that
if any will not be ruled,
binds them ouer to the
peace. Equitie is her
Burse, where men exchange
kindnes for kindnes:
on whose stayres

Iniurie and imposture
durst neuer set their
foule feet. Truth is her
Standard, which with
the Trumpet of Fame
shall resound her happines
to all nations. Plenty
is her Treasurer, Liberalitie
her Almoner,
Conscience her Chancelor,
Wisdome her Counseller,
Prayer her Clerk of
the Closet, Faith her
Crowne, Iustice her Scepter,
Masculine Vertues
her Peeres, Graces her
Attendants, and Nobilitie
her Maid of Honor.
               
               All her Garments are
greene and orient; all

her paths bee Milke, her
words Oracles, and her
works Miracles: making
the blind to see, and the
lame to goe, by a mercifull
supply to their defects.
Her breath is sweeter
then the new blowen
Rose; millions of soules
lie sucking their life frō
it: and the smell of her
garments is like the smel
of Lebanon. Her smiles
are more reuiuing then
the Vertumnall Sunneshine:
and her fauours,
like seasonable dewes,
spring vp flowers and
fruits wheresoeuer shee
walks. Holinesse is the

                  Canopie of State ouer her
head, and Tranquilitie
the Arras where she sets
her foot. All her Seruants
wait in order; and
can with contentfull
knowledge, distinguish
and accept their owne
places. Her Court is an
Image of Paradise; all
her channels slow with
milke, and her Conduits
runne wine. Enuy and
murmuring, as priuy to
their owne guilt, flye
from her Presence. Her
Guard consists not of
men, but Angels: and
they pitch their Tents
about her Palace. Lastly,

hauing preserued and
blessed all her children
on earth, shee goes with
them to heauen; is welcomed
into the armes
of her Father, inuested
Queene with a Diadem
of glory, &amp; possessed of
those ioyes, vnto which
Time shall neuer put
               An End.
