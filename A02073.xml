            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                  FAlling (Gentlemen) by chance amongst a company of no meane Gentlewomen: after supposes and such ordinary sports past, they fell to prattle of the qualities incident to their owne Sexe: one amongst the rest, very indifferent, more addicted to tell the truth, then to selfe conceit, said, That women that had fauours, had most commonly contrary faults: for (quoth shee) beauty is seldome without pride, and wit without inconstancie. The Gentlewomen began to blush, because shee spake so broad, be sure, and blamed her that shee would so fondly foyle her owne nest. Shee still maintained it, that what she had spoken was true: and more, that she had forgotten their little secrecie. Whereupon there grew arguments: and a Sophisticall disputation fell out among the Gentlewomen, about their owne qualities. I sate still as a cypher in Algorisme, and noted what was spoken: which after I had perused in my chamber, and seeing it would be profitable for yong Gentlemen, to know and foresee as well their faults as their fauours, I drew into a fiction the forme and method, in manner of a Metamorphosis: which (Gentlemen) I present vnto your wonted curtesies, desiring you not to looke for any of Ouids wittie inuentions, but for bare and rude discourses: hoping to finde you, as hitherto I haue done, whatsoeuer in opinion, yet fauourable and silent in speech. In which hope setting downe my rest, I bid you farewell.

                  THe busie Bee, that riseth with the Sunne,
                  Hies forth her hiue, to end her daily taske:
                  With weary wings she plies into the fields,
                  And Natures secrets searcheth by her skill,
                  From flower to flower her carefull way doth flie:
                  To sucke her hony from her natiue sweet;
                  Loden, she rich bestirres her to her home,
                  And there she workes and tilles within her hiue:
                  Not for her selfe thus busily she romes,
                  But for vs men, that feed vpon her combes.
                  So GREENE hath sought into the depth of Art,
                  With weary labours toyling at his bookes
                  For fruits, such as the learned Authors yeeld;
                  Searching the secrets that their wits haue pen'd,
                  Tossing amongst their learned principles
                  Their Rhethoricke and deepe Phylosophy:
                  Gathering the sweet that euery Science giues,
                  To carry pleasant hony to his hiue.
                  Not for himselfe alone the Author lookes,
                  But for such men as daigne to read his bookes.

            TO THE RIGHT Worshipfull, Sir Charles Blount, Knight, indewed with perfections of learning, and titles of nobility: Robert Greene wisheth in
               crease of honour and vertue.
            
            
               
                  AChilles, the great Commander of the Mirmidones, had no sooner (Right Worshipfull) encountred the hardie Troian with his Courtelax, and registred his valour on the helme of his enemie, but returning to his tents, hee pourtraied with his pen the praise of Polixena, ioyning Amors with Armors, and the honor of his Learning with the resolution of his Launce. In the Olympiades the Laurell striued as well for the Pen, as the Speare: and Pallas had double Sacrifice, as well perfumes of torne papers, as Incense of broken truncheons. Entring (right worshipfull) with deep insight into these premisses, I found blazoning your resolute indeuors in deeds of Armes, and report figuring out your euer-intended fauours to good letters: presuming vpon the courteous disposition of your Worship, I aduentured to present you, as Lucius did Caesar, who offered him an Helmet topt with Plumes in warres, and a booke stuffed with precepts in peace, knowing that Caesar held it as honorable to be counted an Orator in the Court, as a Souldier in the field. So (right worshipfull) after your returne from the Low Countries, (passing ouer those praise-worthy resolutions executed vpon the enemie)

seeing absence from armes had transformed Campus Martius to mount Helicon, I ouerboldned my selfe to trouble your Worship, with the sight of my Metamorphosis: A pamphlet too simple to patronage vnder so worthy a Maecenas, and vnworthy to be viewed of you, whose thoughts are intended to more serious studies. Yet Augustus would read Poems, and write Roundelayes, 
                  •…
               her to purge melancholly with toyes, then for any delight in such trifles. So I hope your Worship wil, after long perusing of great volumes, cast a glance at my poore pamphlet: wherein is discouered the Anatomy of womens affections: setting out as in a mirror, how dangerous his hazard is, that sets his rest vpon loue: whose essence (if it haue any) is momentany, and effects variable. If either the method, or matter mislike, as wanting scholarisme in the one, or grauity in the other: yet if it shall serue your Worship as a trifle to passe away the time, and so slip with patience, as a boord Iest, I shall be lesse grieued: if any way it please, as to procure you delight, I shall be glad 
                  〈◊〉
                satisfied, as hauing gained the end of my labours: but howsoeuer, hoping your Worship will pardon my presumption in presenting; and weigh more of the well affected will, then of the bad labored worke, I wish your Worship such fortunate fauours, as you can desire, or I imagine.
            
               Your Worships to command, Robert Greene.
            
         
         
            
            TO THE AVTHOVR HIS FRIEND.
            
               WEll hast thou painted in thy learned Prose,
               The perfect portraiture of womens workes:
               How many scapes they shadow with a glose,
               What mortall faults amongst their fauours lurkes.
               How if they haue a vertue to entice,
               A cooling card comes following with a vice:
               Beautie doth grace, and yet is stain'd with pride,
               Faire is abas'd by being ouer-coy:
               It is a gemme, but if inconstant try'd,
               Account it for a trifle and a toy.
               Constant and kinde are vertues that do grace:
               But babbling dames such glories doe deface.
               Vertue thus set oppos'd vnto their vice,
               Giues vs a light to settle safe our loues:
               To feare lest painted shewes may vs entice,
               Subtill are women, then it men behoues
               To read, sweet friend, and ouer-read thy bookes,
               To teach vs'ware of womens wanton lookes.

               LOosing from Tripoly, to make for Alexandria, as we thought to crosse the Seas with a spéedy cut, our Ship had not long gone vnder saile, scarce past two hundred Leagues vpon the maine; but, whether our vnhappy Fortune, the frowardnesse of the Fates, the Constellation of some contrary Aspect, or the particular destinie of some vnhappy Man had so decréed: when the calme was smoothest, the sea without storme, the skie without clouds; then Neptune, to shew he was God of the seas, and AEolus master of the windes, either of them seuerally, and both of them coniointly, so conspired, that they first drew a foggie vale ouer Phoebus face, that the heauens appeared all gloomie, the Trytons daunced, as foreshewing a rough sea; and AEolus setting his winds at libertie, hurled such a gale into the Ocean, that euery surge was ready to ouertake our ship, and the barke ready to founder with euery waue: such and so miserable was our estate, that wee strooke all our Sailes, weighed our Ankers, and let the ship hull at winde and weather, from our handy labours falling to heartie praiers. Thus looking euery houre to commit

our Soules to the gods, and our bodies to the seas, after we had floted by the space of fiue dayes without hope of life, our barke by chance fel vpon the coast of Taprobane, an Iland situated far South, vnder the pole Antarticke, where Canapus the faire starre gladdeth the hearts of the inhabitants: there wee suffered shipwracke, all perishing in the sea, except my infortunate selfe, who count my mis-fortune greater in surueying the rest, than if I had beene partner with them of their destinies. Well, the gods would haue me liue to be more miserable, and despaire I would not, lest I should proue guiltie of mine owne mishap, but taking heart at grasse, wet and weary as I was, I passed vp into the Iland, which I found inhabited and fruitfull, the aire passing temperate, the situation pleasant, the soyle abounding with trées, hearbes, and grasse, fowles and beasts of all kind, the Champian fit for corne and graine, the wood-land full of thickets, the meades full of springs and delightfull fountaines: that the soyle and the aire equally proportioned, the Ile séemed a sacred Eden, or Paradise: much like that faire England, the flower of Europe, stored with the wealth of all the Westerne world, which as ex opposito is contrarily placed farre North, vnder the pole Articke. Well, crept vp the clyffes into the maine continent of this Iland, I wandred farre, and found no village, til at last, vnder a hill I spied a little còttage, at the doore whereof sate an old woman decrepit, ouer-worne with yeares, her haire as white as the Downe found vpon the shrubbes of Arabia, her face full of wrinckles, furrowed so with age, as in her visage appeared the very map of antiquitie; yet might I perceiue by the lineaments of her face, that she had béene beautifull and well featured; and that she was descended from some good parentage, such sparkes of Gentilitie appeared in her countenance. Musing at this old Matron, that sate passing melancholy, my téeth for cold beating in my head, I saluted her in this manner.
            Mother: for this Title I may vse in respect of your age,

crauing pardon if I impart not what reuerence belongs to your estate, in that I am a stranger, I salute you, wishing as many good fortunes may end your dayes, as you haue past ill fortunes in the course of your life. My name, or Countries, little auailes now to reueale, time being too short, and my state too miserable: let it suffice, I am a stranger that haue suffered shipwracke on your coast, my fellow consorts drowned, ending their sorrowes, I escaped, reserued to great mis-fortunes. The weather is cold, and I am wet, might I craue harbour this night, I should bee bound to make such requitall as distresse can affoord, which is thankes, and pray to the gods that you may die as fortunate as the mother of Cleo

The old beldam lifting vp her head, and séeing mee stand shaking for colde, vttered not a word, but taking vp her staffe, and me by the hand, confirmed my welcome with silence, and led mee into her Cottage, where stumbling about on her three legges, shee made me a lustie fire, that cheered my halfe dead limbes, and reuiued what the Sea had halfe mortified. After she perceined I began to waxe warme, and that my colour grew to be fresh, she began to make me answere in this manner.

            With this shee rose from her stoole and went to prouide supper, leauing me amazed at her gracious reply, making me to coniecture by her words, that as she was wise, so shee had beene well brought vp, and was descended of no small Parentage: I sate in a muse till shee had made ready our rates: which being set on the table, we fell to make tryall of our téeth, as before we had done of our tongues, that we began and ended supper without any great chat. Well, our repast taken, the old woman séeing me fitter for sleepe than for prattle, gaue me leaue to goe to bedde, where I past away the night in golden slumbers, lying so long in the morning till Phoebus glimmering on my face, bade me good day.
            Awakt by the summons of the Sunne, I arose, and found mine old Oastesse sitting at her doore in her old melancholly mood, sighing and sorrowfull: an interchange of salues passed

betweene her and me, I with thankes for my great and courteous intertainment, and shee with oft repetitions of welcomes, taking a stoole and si

               ting down by his old dame, seeing shee fell againe to her dumpes, I began to bee thus inquisitiue.
            Mother, if I may without offence presume to vse a question, I would inquire what I muse at, and be absolued in a darke Enigma that I haue found in your cottage: but rather had I still hold my thoughts in suspence, than be offensiue either to your age, or to so courteons an Oastesse. The old woman smiling at my feare, or at my folly, bade me say on: and I boldly prosecuted my purpose thus.
            Since my arriuall in your Cottage, I haue noted your thoughts to be passionate, and your passions to be violent: I haue seene care lurking midst the wrinkles of your age, and sorrow breath'd out with broken sighes. I do not deny but age is giuen to melancholy, and many yeeres acquainted with many dumps: but such farre fetcht grones, the hecalts of griefes, such deepe sighes the Ambassadors of sorrow, make me thinke either you grieue at your sinnes with repentance, or else recount some great forepassed misfortunes: this is the doubt, and here lies the question.
            I had no sooner vttered these words, but the old woman leaning her head against her staffe, fell into such bitter teares, as did discouer a multitude of sorrowes and perplexed passions: insomuch as taking pittie of her griefes, I lent her a fewe luke warme drops, to shew how in minde I did participate of her vnknowne

And here multiplying sigh vpon sigh with double and trebble reuies, shee ceased: but I desirous to know the sequell of their misfortunes, asked her the cause and manner of their mishaps: she replyed not, but taking mee by the hand, shee led mee from her cottage, to a valley hard by, where she brought me to a marble piller, fashioned and pourtraied like a woman, which made me remember Pigmalions picture,

I amased at this strange gréeting of Alcida and the stone, drew more nigh, and there I might perceiue the Image to hold in either hand a table. In the right hand was depainted the protraiture of Venus, holding the ball that brought Troy to ruine, and vnder were written these verses.
            
               When Nature forged the faire vnhappy mould,
               Wherein proud beauty tooke her matchlesse shape:
               She ouer-slipt her cunning and her skill,
               And aym'd to faire, but drew beyond the marke;
               For thinking to haue made a heauenly blisse,
               For wanton gods to dally with in heauen,
               And to haue fram'd a precious iem for men,
               To solace all their dumpish thoughts with glee,
               Shee wrought a plague, a poyson, and a hell:
               For gods, for men, thus no way wrought she well.
               Venus was faire, faire was the queene of loue,
               Fairer then Pallas, or the wife of Ioue;
               Yet did the Gigglets beauty greeue the Smith,
               For that she brau'd the Creeple with a horne.
               Mars said, her beauty was the starre of heauen,
               Yet did her beauty staine him with disgrace:
               Paris for faire, gaue her the golden ball;
               And bought his, and his fathers ruine so:
               Thus nature making what should farre excell,
               Lent gods, and men, a poison and a hell.

                  His spotted traine, fetcht from old Argus head,
               With golden rayes, like to the brightest sunne:

               Till midst his hot an glorious fumes,
               He spies his feete, and then lets fall his plumes.
               Beauty breeds pride, pride hatcheth forth disdaine,
               Disdaine gets hate, and hate calls for reuenge,
               Reuenge with bitter prayers vrgeth still:
               Thus selfe-loue nursing vp the pompe of pride,

                   daughter, called (for her beauty in her cradle) Flordespine: Nature had so inricht her with supernaturall beauty, that

shee séemed an immortall creature, shrowded in a mortall carcase, in somuch that if her times had been equall with Troy, Paris had left Greece, and come to Taprobane for her loue. Liuing thus loued and admired of all: selfe-houe the moth that créepeth into young mindes, so tickled her with the conceit of her owne beauty, that shee counted no time well spent which shee bestowed not in setting out that more glorious by Art, which Nature had made so absolute and excellent: no drugges from Arabia, that might cleere the skinne, were vnsought for: no herbes nor secrets that any Philosopher in Physicke had found out, which might increase beautie, but she made experience of: following Venus euery way in such vanities, and playing the right woman: for, to confesse the truth, their sexe careth more for the tricking of their faces, than the tearing of their soules, spending an houre rather in righting the tresses of their haire, than a moment in bending their thoughts to deuotion. The foulest must be faire, if not in déed, yet in conceit: and she that is faire must venter her soule to kéep her beauty inuiolate: but leauing off this digression, my daughter Flordespine being thus selfe conceited, was more curious than wise, and could sooner afford a pound of pride, then an ounce of humility: for diuers Noble men resorted from all the bordering Ilande to be sutors vnto her, but her beauty made her so coy, that happy was hee that might haue a glance of her perfection. So that many came ioyful in hope to haue fauor, but departed sorrowfull, answered with disdaine. For as none pulleth vp the barran root, but he is stifled with the sauour: as none looketh into the poole of Babylon, but he hasardeth his health: as none gaseth against the Cockatrice, but either hee loseth his sight, or his life; so none tooke view of the beauty of Flordespine, but they returned either frantike in affection, fond with fancy, or pained with a thousand perplexed passions. Yet she taking delight in their griefes, resembled the Crysolite, which the mere it is beaten with hammers, the harder it is, and as the

Palme trée can by no meanes be depressed, nor the Margarites of Europe wrought into no other forme, than Nature hath fram'd them: so no praiers, promises, passions, sighes, sorrowes, plaints, teares nor treaties could preuaile, to make her showe some fauour to any of her sutors. In so much that the poore Noble men finding themselues fettered, without hope of fréedome, séeing their liberties restrained within an endlesse labyrinth, and no courteous Ariadne to giue them a clew of thréed to draw them out of their miseries, cried out against loue, against Venus, against women, as mercilesse monsters, hatched to torture the mindes of men: and at last spying their owne follies, shaking off the shackles of 
                     〈◊〉
                   with disdaine, went home, and at their departure pronounced with Demosthenes, that they would not Poenitentiam tantiemere. Cupid
                   séeing how his schollers florked from his schoole, thought hee would retaine some one, with whom to dally; and therefore pulling forth a fierce inflamed arrow, hee strooke the sonne of a Noble man here in Taprobane to the quicke, that he of all the rest remained fast snared in her beauty: his name was Telegonus, a Youth euery way equall to Fiordespine, except in parentage, and yet he was no meaner man than the son of an Earle. This Telegonus (omitting his proportion and qualities, for that it shall suffice to say they were excellent) hauing had a sight of Fiordespine, stood as the Deere at the gaze, swallowing vp gréedily the inuenomed hooke that Venus so subtilly had baited for him: for after the Idea of her person and perfection had made a déepe impression in his minde, and that hee had passed thrée or foure daies in ruminating her excellency, and debated in his bed with many lewtene slumber how swéete a saint she was, he fell from liking to so deepe loue, that nothing but death did rase it out.
               And thus he marched vnder the standard of fancy, being but a fresh water souldier to abide the alarums of affection, feeling a restlesse passion that fretted his minde, as the caterpiller the fruit, he could not tell on which care to sleep,

but builded Castles in the ayre, and cast beyond the moone: first, hee began to consider with himselfe, how many braue Noble men of sundry Ilands, rich in possessions, honourable in parentage, in qualities rare, in property excellent, had sought her loue, and yet missed. When hee had made comparison betweene himselfe and them, despaire began with darke perswasions to disswade him from attempting such high loues, knowing, that Aquila non capit muscas: Ladies of great beauty looke not at meane 
                     〈◊〉

                     〈◊〉
                  .
               These premises considered, poore Telegonus sad, nipped on the pate with these new thoughts, resembling the melancholy disposition of Troilus, for the inconstancy of Cressida, yet after hee had mused awhile, and past ouer a fewe dreaming dumpes; Hope clad in purple suted robes, tolde him that Cupid had but one string to his bowe, one head to one arrow; that Venus greatest number was an vnity, how the heart could harbour but one fancy, and one woman be wedded but to one man. Therefore though they mist, as either infortunate, or crossed by some contrary influence, sith loues fee simple was registred in the court of their destinies, there was no cause of his despaire, but that hee might bee the man that should enioy Fiordespine, and set vp the trophee of loue, maugre all the sinister determinations of Cupid, Floting thus between despaire and hope; he passed ouer three or foure dayes melancholy and passionate, taking his only content in being solitary: so that at last finding himselfe all alone, feeling the fire too great to smother in secrecy, he burst forth into these flames.
               Ah Telegonus, miserable in thy life, and infortunate in thy loues: is thy youth blasted with fancy, or the prime of thy yeeres daunted with affection: canst thou no sooner see Paphos, but thou must prouide sacrifice for Venus?

No, no, loue is without law, and therefore aboue all lawe: honoured in heauen, feared in earth, and a very terror to the infernall ghosts: Bow then vnto that Telegonus, whereunto lawlesse necessity doth bend: be not so fond, as with Zeuxes to bind the Ocean in fetters: fight not with the Rascians against the wind: bark not with the Wolues against the Moone: seeke not with them of S

It is hard for thee with the Crabbe to striue against the stream, or to wrastle with a fresh wound, lest thou make the sore more dangerous. Wel Telegonus, what of all this prate? thou dost loue: thou honorest beauty as supernatural: thou sayst, Venus amongst al the goddesses is most mighty:

that there is no Iland like Paphos, no bird like the doues, no god like Cupid: what of this? but why dost yu loue no meaner woman then Fiordespine, the daughter of the Prince, the fairest in Taprobane? Ah Telegonus, derogate not from her beauty, the fairest in the world: vnhappy man in recounting her beauty, in reckoning her perfections, thou doest imblaze thine owne misfortunes: for the more shee is excellent, the lesse will be her loue, and the greater her disdaine.

No, for the more beauty, the more pride, and the more pride, the more precisenesse. None must play on Ormenes harpe, but Orpheus: none rule Lucifer but Phoebus: none weare Venus in a tablet but Alexander, nor none enioy Fiordespine, but such a one as farre exceedeth thee in person and personage. Tush Telegonus, enter not into these doubts: Sapho a Quéene loued Phao a Ferri-man; shee beautiful and wise, he poore and seruile: she holding a scepter, hee an Oare; the one to gouerne, the other to labour. Angelica forsooke diuers Kings and tooke Medon a mercenary Souldier: Loue Telegonus hath no lack; Cupid shooteth his shafts at randon; Venus as soone looketh at the sun, as at a star.

admitted to put in no plea at the barre of loue. Telegonus hauing, by vttering these passions, disburdened some part of his paines, and yet not in such sort, but his temples were restlesse, his griefe much, his content none at all, his care in his sleepe incessant, his mind melancholy, so that his only delight was to be in dumpes; in so much, that he gadded solitary vp and downe the Groues as a Satyre enamoured of some Country Nymph. Cupid seeing his art did well, thought to shews him some sport; for on a day as hee walked, contemplating the beauty of Fiordespine, being sore athirst with inward sorrow, he went to a fountaine hard by to coole his heate, where he found his heart set on fire with a great

                  ke heart at grasse, thinking that by this fit opportunity, Loue aud Fortune began to fauour his enterprise: willing therfore not to omit so good an occasion, he saluted them in this sort.
               Muse not, faire creatures, if I stand in a maze, sith the sight of your surpassing beauties makes me doubt, whether I should honour you as earthly ladies, or adore you as heauenly goddesses: for no doubt Paris neuer saw fairer in Ida. But now noting with déep insight the figure of your diuine faces; I acknowledge your honours to bee sisters to our prince, whom I reuerence, as allyed to my souereigne, and offer my sernice, as a seruant euer deuoted to such faire and excellent saints.
               The ladies hearing this strange and vnlooked for salutation, began to smile: but Fiordespine frowning, as halfe angry he should presume into her presence, with a coy countenance returned him this answere.
               If sir Telegonus, for so I suppose is your name, your

eye-sight be so bad, perhaps with péering too long on your bookes, or your selfe so far beside your sences, as to take vs for Nymphes: I would wish you either to read lesse, or to prouide you a good Physicion, else shall you not iudge colours for me: and yet since I would you should know, wee count our penny good siluer, and thinke our faces, if not excellent, yet such as may boote compare.
               
                  Telegonus taking opportunity by the forehead, and thinking to strike the yron at this heat, made reply.
               Maiden, hee might be thought either blinde or enuious, that would make a doubt of Venus beauty, and he be déemed either frantike or foolish, that cannot see and say, as you are superior to most, so are you inferiour to none. Pardon Madam, if my censure be particular, I meane of your sweet selfe, whose fauours I haue euer loued and admired, though vnworthy to set my fancy on such glorious excellency.
               
                  Fiordespine hearing her self thus praised, was not greatly displeased, yet past she ouer what was spoken, as though her eares had beene stopt with Vlisses: but Eriphila, the second, who was as wise as her sister was beautifull, desired Telegonus to rest him by them on the grasse, and that they would at their departure aske him as a guard to the court: Telegonus as glad of this command, as if he had been willed by the gods to haue béen chamberlaine to Venus, sa

               Your late passionate speech Telegonus, to my sister Fiordespine, makes me think that Venus is your chiefe goddesse, and that loue is the lord, whose liuery you weare: if it be so, neighbour take heede (for fancie is a Shrew) many like, that are neu

weare the target, and Mars the distaffe, Omphalo handle the club, and Hercules the spindle: Alexander must crouch, and Campaspe looke coy: women will rule in loues, howsoeuer men bee l

                     us, him whom no mortall creature can controle, loue can command: no dignity is able to resist Cupids deitie. Achilles was made by his mother Thetis invulnerable, yet wounded by fancie: Hercules not to be conquered of any, yet quickly conquered by affection: Mars able to resist Iupiter, but not to withstand beautie. Loue is not onely kindled in the eye by desire, but ingrauen in the minde by destinie, which neither reason can eschew, nor wisedome expell: the more pittie I confesse Madam, for poore men, and the greater impietie in the gods, that in giuing loue free libertie, they grant him a lawlesse priuiledge; but since Cupid will bee obeyed, I am contented to bowe: especially, seeing I haue chanced to set my affection on so excellent a creature.
               And who might that be, I pray you (quoth Fiordespine) (taking the matter in dudge
                     •…
                  , that Telegonus should make report) that is of such great excellencie? dwelleth shee in Taprobane? In Taprobane Madam, replied Telegonus, but with such a peale of sighes, bewraying his loues in silence: that Eriphila smiling, sayd; I see fire cannot bée hidden in the Flaxe without smoke, nor Muske in the bosome without smell, nor loue in the brest without suspition: I perceiue, in faith neighbour, by your lippes what lettice you loue: the saint that you account of such excellency, whose perfection hath so snared your sences, is my sister Fiordespine. I, quoth Fiordespine, filling her Iuory browes full of Shrewish wrinkles, I hope the young lord Telegonus knowes what Suters I haue shaken off: and therefore not inferring comparisons, because they bee odious, I may giue him his answere with an &amp;c. There are more Maydes then Maulkin, and more birds for the Faulcon to pearch with, then the Eagle: the Lyon is a

bloudy beast, for that he knoweth his strength: I will not conclude: but lord Telegonus, if I be the woman you mean, cease from your sute, for in faith so well I doe loue you, that you cannot more displease mee, then in seeking to please mee: for if I knew no other cause to mislike, yet this might suffice, that I cannot loue. At this flat and peremptorie answere, Telegonus sate nipped on the pate, like to them which taste of the fish Mugra, whose operation maketh them for a time sencelesse: which Eriphila espying, thinking to iumpe euen with the Gentleman, pittying his passions, in that Fiordespine was so coy to so courteous a Youth, sayd: You may see now Telegonus, that Venus hath her frownes, as shee hath smiles: that Cupid hath arrowes headed with

               The paines that louers take, for hunting after losse, if their mindes were not confirmed with some secret inchantment, were able to keepe their fancies for being inflamed, or else to coole desire alreadie kindled: for the daies are spent in thoughts, and the nights in dreames: both in danger, either of beguiling vs of that wee had, or promising vs that wee haue not. The head fraught with fantasies, fiered with ielosie, troubled with both: yea so many inconueniences waite vpon loue as to reckon them all, were infinite: and to ta

So that I cōclude, that as none euer sawe the altars of Busiris without sorrow, nor banqueted with Phoebus without surfetting: so as impossible it is to deale with Cupid, and not either to gaine speedie death, or endlesse danger. As I was ready in defence of loue to make reply, there came a little page from their lady mother, to call them home to dinner: wherupon they all rose, and would haue taken their leaue, but boldly

I stood to my tackling, and told them: Ladies you passe not so; for construe my meaning how you please, or accept of my repay how you list, I will not bee so discourteous to leaue you so slenderly guided, as in the guard of this little page: and with that I conducted them vnto the court, and there with a loth to depart, tooke my leaue, hauing a courteous farewell of all but of Fiordespine, who parmning like Iuno, in her mai

                   haue her so light, fond youth, as to stoope to the lure at the first call. Helena was wanton, yet was shee long in wooing: Paris courted her before he caught her: if a straggler made it strange, blame not her that is vertuous and a Uirgin, if she be somewhat coy: resting in this hope, he somewhat appeased his passions, driuing away his melancholy and despairing humours, by setting his rest on this point. But loue that is impatient, was in the day his companion, and in the night his pillow: Venus commanded her sonne to be beaten with Roses, which as they are faire coloured, and sauour sweet, so they are full of prickes, and pierce the skin: Loue, thus hammering in the head of Telegonus, hee was

doubtfull what to do, or how best to prosecute his purpose: to repaire to the court, and there to court her, was to attempt an aduenture very perilous and halfe impossible: to seeke meanes to parle with her, was to offer blank papers to Venus: therefore he resolued to write vnto her, and therupon entering into his studie, hee tooke pen and paper, and sent vnto her in this effect.

                  TElegonus hauing finished his letter, caused it to be deliuered to Fiordespine with great trustinesse and secrecie, who receiuing it with a frowning looke, as halfe suspecting the contents, yet vnripped the seales and read it: which when shee had throughly perused, draue her into such a furie, that shee in a rage rent it, and flung it into the fire, saying: There end his letters and his loues. But as the Sea once hoysed with a gale, calmeth not till it hath passed with a storme; as the stone Pyrites once set on fire burneth in the water: so a womans stomake once stirred, ceaseth not to be discontent, till it bee glutted with reuenge: for, Fiordespine not satisfied with tearing the letter of Telegonus, could take no rest, till either shee had breathed out some hard speeches with her tongue, or set downe bitter taunts with her pen, séeing therefore no fit meanes for the one, shee stept in great choller to her standish, and wrote to him thus satyrically.

How I am greeued at your letters, gesse by my sharp reply: how I like of your lines, examine in my writing: how I disdaine them both, time shall put you in euidence. My beautie, you say, hath made an impression in your heart: a man of soft metall, that so soone takes the stampe; a louer of great conceit, that is fixed at the first looke: but since it is your gentle nature to be so full of fancie, I would haue the gods to make you either Venus chamberlaine, or Cupids chaplaine, or both: because being so amorous, you should not want offices: you forestalled me in red letters, with an obiection that many your betters haue courted me and mist: then good louely lord Telegonus, thinke not, if I delighted not to gaze at stars, that I meane to stumble at stones: if I vouchsafe not to smel to most fragrant flowers, that I mean to make me a nosegay of wéeds. If honorable princes offered to Venus, and could not be heard, and sought for my fauours but found them not, I thinke: suppose the rest, for I list not be tedious, lest I should weary my selfe, and grace thée with writing so much. For thy loyalty keep it for thy equals: for thy loue, lay it not on me, lest as I disdaine thy person, so I reuenge thy presumption. And so my hand was weary, my eyes sleepie, and my heart full of contempt, and with that I went to bed.

The Aspis stingeth not more deadly, the serpent Porphirius inuenometh not more déepely, neither did euer the sight of Medusas head more amaze a man, than the contents of this satyricall letter did Telegonus: yea it draue the poore Gentleman into so many passions, that he became halfe lunaticke, as if hee had eaten of the seed of sputanta, that troubleth the braine with giddinesse: he fell to exclaime against Venus and her deitie, blaming the gods that would suffer such a gigglet to remaine in heauen, repeating her lawlesse loues with Adonis, and her scapes with Mauors. Cupid he called a boy, a fondling, blind in his ayme, and accursed in hitting the marke: rageth against women, saying; they were mercilesse, cruell, vniust, deceitfull, like vnto the Crocodile in teares: in sight, they seeme to be Carnations; in smelling, Roses; in hearing, Syrens; in taste, wormewood: in touching, nettles: Thus he rayled and raged casting himselfe on his

               THis letter finished and sent vnto Fiordespine, so troubled her patience, for that Telegonus was importunate, that she fared like the frownes of Bacchus, halfe mad at this secret motion, swearing reuenge, if either her selfe or her friends could performe it: and in this humor she sent him by her Page, these few lines.
               
                  
                     Fiordespine to Telegonus.
                     I Had scarce read thy letters before I rent them, estéeming thy papers and thy loue a like; for as I mislike the one, so I disdaine the other. Hath ouer-much folly driuen thee into a frensie, or hath want of manners made thee impudent? Wilt thou bragge with Irus the begger amongst Penelopes sutors, or séeke with the smoky Cyclops to kisse Venus hand? looke on thy feete, and so let fall thy plumes: stretch not so high, vnlesse thy sleeue were longer: for Fiordespine scorneth so much as to looke at Telegonus in respect of loue, as Iuno did to iest with the father of the Centaures.
                     If I knew thy passions were as great, as thou decipherest thy griefe, and thy thoughts as fiery as the hils in Sycily, I would laugh at the one, as ioying at thy sorrowes, and put oyle in the flame, as delighting to aggrauate thy miseries.

Sith then thou séest my resolution to be so regorous (ouer-rash youth) betake thée to thy dumpes, and fare how thou list: for know, I mislike thy sute, and hate thy person, and will liue and dye thine enemy, if for no other cause, yet for that thou hast dared to court Fiordespine.
                     
                     
                        Thy mortall enemy, Fiordespine of Taprobane.

                  ace my selfe with the other two daughters, Eriphila and Marpesia. This Eriphila was as wittie, as her sister was beautifull, so that she was admired in Taprobane, and all the bordering regions about, accounted (though not in yéeres, yet in wit) a Sibil: beeing able to answere as darke an Enigma, as the subtillest Sphinx was able to propound: and I tel thee, sonne, as she was fauoured by Pallas, so Venus was not behind in her fauours: for she was beautifull, insomuch, that these gifts co-vnited, made sundrie Suters come from sundry coasts, to bee wooers to such a wily Minton.
               Amongst the rest, by fortune, there arriued in this coast,

imbarked in a small Pinace, the Dukes sonne of Massilia, called Meribates: who comming on shoare for fresh water, came to see the Court of Taprobane: where being greatly welcommed by my sonne, falling into talk with my daughters, hee found Eriphila so adorned with a supernaturall kinde of wit, as hee was snared in the sweetnesse of her answeres: swallowing downe the conceit of her wisedome with such greedinesse, that hee lay drunks in the remembrance of her qualities; finding seuerall delayes to make stay in the country couertly: causing his Mariners to crack their tackling, to vnrigge their Shippe in the night, that they might haue iust cause to lye there the most part of that Summer. Loue beginning to make this youngster politike, caught him so fast by the heart, that Mars was neuer more feately intangled in Vulcans net, nor the forerunners of Iason more subtilly wrapped in the labyrinth, then Meribates wa

               Infortunate Meribates, whom the enuious Fates haue scorned to make infortunate! Hast thou mann'd thy selfe in a Barke to scoure the Seas, and in this quest art thou like to lose thy sences? Soughtest thou to abide the pleasure of Neptune, and art faine to stand to the courtesie of loue? Hast thou found flames amidst the waues? Fire in the water, and fancy where no affection was meant? well now I see, that as the Bee that flyeth from flowre to flowre, hauing free choyse to choose at libertie, is at last taken by the wings, and so fettered: In like manner

If thou meanest to marrie, thou canst not haue a méeter match: yea, but how if her heart be placed, and her mind settled vpon some Gentleman in Taprobane? then were I a great deale better to wayle at the first, then to weepe at the last: to be content with a little pricke, then a deepe wound; to

               Fearefulnesse (Meribates) in loue is a vertue: hast thou turned ouer so many bookes of Philosophy, and hast thou not quoted Phocas precept to bee fruitfull? that louers

should procéede iu their suite, as the Crabbe, whose pace is euer backward; that though loue bee like the Adamant which hath vertue to drawe, yet thou shouldest bee sprinkled with Goates bloud, which resisteth his operation.

No, let not the precepts of Philosophy subject the will of nature; youth must haue his course: he that will not loue when hee is young, shall not bee loued when hee is olde: say then Meribates, and neuer gaine-say, that Eriphila is the marke thou shoote at: that her surpassing wit is the Syren, whose song hath in

                     bates the cause of thy loue, lest thou faile in the effects. Is the foundation of thy fancy fixed vpon her feature; think with thy selfe, Beautie is but a blossome, whose flowre is nipt with euery frost: it is like the grasse in India, which withereth before it springeth: What is more faire, yet what more fading? What more delightfull, yet nothing more deadly? What more pleasant, and yet what is more perilous?
               Beautie may well bee compared to the bath in Calycut: whose streams flow as cleere as the floud Padus, and whose operation is as pestilent, as the Riuer Ormen: I but Meribates, what more cleere then the Crystall, and what more precious? what more comely then cloth of Arras, so what more costly? what creature so beautifull as a woman, and what so estimable? Is not the Diamond of greatest dignity that is most glistering: and the pearle thought most precious, that is most perfect in colour?
               
                  Aristotle saith, they cannot be counted absolutely happy, although they had all the vertues, if they want beautie: yea, Apollonius (an arch-heretike, and a professed enemy

against the sacred lawes of beauty) is driuen both by the lawes of Nature, and nurture, to confesse that Uertue is the more acceptable, by how much the more it is placed in a beautifull bodie: but what long digressed discourse is this thou makest of beautie, Meribates? it is not vpon such a

                  Meribates hauing thus debated with himselfe, re
                     •…
                  ed on this resolution: that he would moderate his affection, vntill he found opportunity to discourse his mind to Eriphila: who on the contrary side noting the perfectiō of Meribates, was more enamored of his person and qualities, then Phillis of Demophon, or Dido of the false and vniust Troian: for he was so courteous in behauiour, so liberall not onely of his purse, but his courtesie, that he had wonne all their hearts in Taprobane.
               
               These considerations so tickled the mind of Eriphila, that shee fell thus to debate with her selfe. What meanes (Eriphila) these strange and sodaine passions: shall thy stayed life be compared now to the Camelion, that turneth her self into the likenesse of euery obiect? to the herbe Phanaros, whose budde is sweet, and the roote bitter? to the Rauens in Arabia, which being young, haue a pleasant voice, but in their age a horrible crie? Wilt thou consent vnto lust, in hoping to loue? Shall Cupid claime thee for his captiue, who euen now wert vowed a vestall Uirgine? Shall thy tender age bee more vertuous then thy ripe yéeres? What, shall the beauty of Meribates inchant thy minde, or his filed speech be witch thy senses? Shall the property

of a stranger drawe thee on to affection? If thou shouldest hap to like him, would hee not thinke the Castle wanted but scaling, that yeeldeth at the first shot? That the bulwarke wanteth but batterie, that at the first parley yeelds vp the keyes? Yes, yes Eriphila, his beauty argues inconstancy, and his painted phrases deceit: and if he see thee wonne with a word, hee will thinke thee lost with the winde: he will iudge that which is lightly to be gained, is as quickly lost.
               The Hawke that commeth at the first call, will neuer proue stedfast on the stand. The Niese that will be reclaimed to the fist, at the first sight of the lure, will bate at euery bush: The woman that will loue at the first looke, will neuer be charie of her choyce. Take heed Eriphila, the finest scabbard hath not euer the brauest blade; nor the goodliest chest hath not the most gorgeous treasure: the Bell with the best sound hath an iron clapper: the fading apples of Tantalus haue a gallant shewe, but if they be touched, they turne to ashes: So a faire face may haue a foule mind; swéet words, a sowre heart: yea rotten bones out of a painted sepulchre; for all is not gold that glisters. UUhy, but yet the Iemme is chosen by his hiew, and the cloth by his colour: condemne not then Eriphila, before thou hast cause: accuse not so strictly without tryall; search not so narrowly, till thou hast occasion of doubt.
               Yea, but the Mariners sound at the first, for feare of a Rocke: the Chirurgion tainteth betimes, for his surest proofe: one fore-wit is worth two after: it is not good to beware whon the act is done: too late commeth repentance: what is it the beauty of Meribates that kindleth this flame? who more beautifull then Iason, yet who more false? for after Medea had yeelded, he sacked the fort, and in liew of her loue, he killed her with

               Beware Eriphila, I haue heard thee say: she that marries for beautie, for euery dramme of pleasure, shall haue

a pound of sorrow: choose by the 
                     •…
                  are, not by the eye. Meribates is faire, so was Paris, and yet fickle: hee is witty, so was Corsiris, and yet wauering: No man knoweth the nature of the hearbe, by the outward shew, but by the inward iuice; and the operation consists in the matter, not in the forme.
               The Foxe winnes the fauour of the Lambes by play, and then deuours them: so perhaps Meribates shewes himselfe in outward shewe a demy god: whereas who tries him inwardly, shall finde him but a solemne saint. Why, since his arriuall in Taprobane, all the Iland speakes of his vertue and courtesie: but perchance hee makes a vertue of his néede, and so layes this baulmed hooke of fained honesty, as a luring baite to trap some simple Dame.
               The cloth is neuer tried, vntill it come to the wearing, nor the linnen neuer shrinkes, till it comes to the wetting: so want of liberty to vse his will, may make a restraint of his nature: and though in a strange place hee vse faith and honesty to make his marriage, yet she perhaps that shall try him, shal either find he neuer had them, or quite forgot them: for the nature of men (as I haue heard say) is like the Amber-stone, which will burne outwardly, and frieze inwardly: and like the barke of the Mirtle trees that grew in Armenia, that is as hot as fire in the taste, and as colde as water in the operation.

Trie then Eriphila ere thou trust, especially since hee is a stranger: prooue ere thou put in practise: cast the water before thou appoint the medecine: doe all things with deliberation: goe as the Snaile faire and softly, haste makes waste: the malt is euer sweetest, where the fire is softest: let not wit ouercome wisedome, nor the hope of a husband be the

hazard of thine honestie: cast not thy credite on the chance of a stranger, who perchance may proue to thee as Theseus did to Ariadne: wade not too far where the f
                     •…
                  rd is vnknowne: rather bridle thy affections with reason, and mortifie thy mind with modesty: that as thou hast kept thy Uirginitie inuiolate without spot, so thy choice may bee without blemish: know this, it is too late to call againe the day past: therefore kéepe the memorie of Meribates as needfull, but not necessarie: like him, whom thou shalt haue occasion to loue, and loue where thou hast tried him loyall: vntill then remaine indifferent.
               When Eriphila had vttered these words, she straight (to auoide all dumpes that solitarinesse might breede) came to me and her sister, and there passed away the day in prattle. Thus these two louers passionate, and yet somewhat patient, for that hope had ministred lenitiue plaisters to their new wounds, passed ouer two or three daies onely with glances and lookes, bewraying their thoughts with their eyes, which they could not discouer with their tongues: Venus taking pitty of her patients, found them out so fit occasion, that as Eriphila with her sister Marpesia were walking alone in the garden, gathering of flowers, at that instant (guided by loue and fortune) Meribates went into the garden to be solitarie, where straight he espied his mistris walking with her sister: now Meribates was driuen into an 
                     〈◊〉
                  , with the extreme pleasure hee conceiued in the sodaine sight of his goddesse: insomuch, as hee stood amazed for feare, and necessity found a deadly combate in the mind of Meribates: he doubted if he should be ouer bold, to giue offence to Eriphila, and so spill his pottage. But the law of necessitie (saith Plato) is so hard, that the gods themselues are not able to resist it: for as the water that by nature is cold, is made hot by the force of fire, and the straight tree pressed downe groweth alwayes crooked, so nature is subiect to necessitie, that kind cannot haue his course: and yet if there be any thing which is more forcible then necessitie,

it is the lawe of loue, which so incensed Meribates, that casting all feare aside, he offered himselfe to his mistresse, with this courteous parle.

                  Meribates hearing so courteous and witty an answere, swilled in loue as merrily as euer Iupiter did vertue: so that delighting to heare his mistresse prattle, hee prosecuted his talke thus.

               I but sir (quoth Marpesia) from whence will you drawe your arguments to prooue mee in maiestie like Iuno? you dare not say, from reason, in regard y• the persons are without compare; and from loue if you argue, you proue your selfe double faced like Ianus, and double hearted like Iupiter, to haue two strings to a bowe, and two loues at one time.
               Yes Madam, quoth Meribates, my common place in this Enthymema shall bee also from loue, for in affecting so dearely your sister, I cannot but déeply honour you, if not in loue as my Paramour, yet in friendly affection as her sister.
               You harpe still, answered Eriphila, on one string, which is loue: if you be in earnest, looke for a frowne, as I gaue you a fauour: beleeue me, lord Meribates, there is nothing easier than to fall in loue, nor harder than to chance well; therefore, omitting such serious matter as fancie, for that I am vowed to Vesta, tell mee, will you prouide you, as we, of a Nosegay? And if you be so minded, tell me, of all flowers which like you best? Those, Madam, that best fit with my present humour. And what bee they, quoth Marp

Penses, Madam, answered Meribates, for it is a prettie flowre, and of sundrie colours, seeding the eye with varietie, which is the chiefest pleasure to the sight: especially I like it for the agnonimation, in that the word comming from France, signifies fancies. Now how I am contented with fancies, I would you could as well see, as I feele.
               
                  One while imagination presents vnto me the Idea of my mistris face, which I allow with a fancie: another while a thought of her beautie wakens my sences, which I con

               Thus are my thoughts sed with fancies: and to be brief, my life is lengthned out by fancies: then Madam, blame me not if I like Penses well; and thinke nothing, if I set no other flowre in my nosegay. And truly lord Meribates, answered Eriphila, you and I are of one mind, I meane in choice of flowres, but not sir, as it is called a Pense, or as you descant on fancie: but as we homely Huswiues call it, Hearts-ease, for of all contents I thinke this the greatest; for in naming this word Hearts-ease, I banish (as with a charme) the frownes of fortune, and the follies of loue, for the partie that is toucht by the inconstancy of the one, or the vanitie of the other, cannot boast hee meaneth hearts ease: seeing then it

               As these two louers were thus merrily descanting vpon flowres, I came into the Garden, and found this young lord and my daughter at chat, no whit displeased, in that I knew the honour of his house, his great possessions and parentage, I winkt at their loues, and after a little ordinary parle called them in to dinner: where there was such

               But when shee weighed his wise and witty arguments that he vttered in the garden, how they not onely sauored of wit, but of mirth: then

Can the straw resist the vertue of the pure Iet, or flaxe the force of the fire? can a louer with stand the brunt of beauty, or fréeze if he stand be the flame, or preuent the lawes of nature: weigh all things equally, and then I doubt not but to haue a iust iudgement: and, though small acquaintance may bréede mistrust, and mistrust hinders loue: yet tract of time shall inferre such tryall, as I trust shall kindle affection. And therefore I hope you will not put a doubt till occasion be offered, nor call his credit in question, whome neyther you haue found nor heard to be halting: what though the Serpentine powder is quickly kindled, and quickly out? yet the Salamander stone once sette on fire, can n

And

sure Eriphila, I call the gods to witnesse, without fayning, that sith thy wit hath so bewitched my heart, my loyaltie and loue shall bee such, as thy honour and beautie doth m

                  rite. Sith therefore my fancie is such, repay but halfe so much in recompence, and it shall bee sufficient. Eriphila hearing this passionate speech of Meribates, made him this answere.
               Lord Meribates, it is hard taking the fowle when the net is descried, and ill catching of fish when the hooke is bare, and as impossible to make her beleeue that will giue no credite, and to deceiue her that spieth the fetch. When the string is broken, it is hard to hit the white, when a mans credite is called in question, it is hard to perswade one. Blame me not (Meribates) if I vrge you so strictly, nor thinke nothing if I suspect you narrowly: a woman may knit a knot with her tongue, that shee cannot vntie with all her teeth, and when the signet is set on, it is too late to breake the bargaine, therefore I had rather mistrust too soone, then mislike too late: I had rather feare my choice, then rue my chance: for a womans heart is like the stone in Egypt, that will quickely receiue a forme, but neuer change without cracking. If then I feare, thinke mee not cruell; nor scrupulous, if I be wise for my selfe: the Wolfe hath as smooth a skin as the simple sheepe the sowre Elder hath a fairer barke then the sweete Iuniper: where the sea is calmest, there it is deepest, and where the greatest colour of honestie is, there oftentimes is the most want: for Venus vess

               Thus I cast all these doubts, and others haue tryed them true, yet am I forced by fancy to take some remorse of thy passions. Medea knew the best, but yet followed the worst in choosing Iason: but I hope not to finde thee so wauering.
               
                  Well Meribates, to be short and plaine, thou hast wonne the castle that many haue besieged, and hast obtained that which others haue sought to gaine: it is not the shape of thy beautie, but the hope of thy loyalty which inticeth me: not thy faire face, but thy faithful heart: not thy parentage, but thy manners: not thy possessions, but thy vertues: for she that builds her loue vpon beauty, meanes to fancie but for a while: would God I might find thee such a one as I will trie my selfe to be, for whereas thou dost protest such loialtie, which suppose it be true, yet shall it be but counterfait respecting mine, be thou but Admetus, and I will be Alcest, no torments, no trauell: no, only the losse of life shal diminish my loue, in liew thereof remaine thou but constant, and in pledge of my protested good will, haue heere my heart and hand to be thine in dust and ashes.
               Here (son) maist thou iudge into what quandary Meribates was driuen, when he heard the answer of his mistris so correspondent to his sute: the prisoner being condemned hearing the rumor of his pardon, neuer reioiced more then Meribates did at this pronouncing of his happinesse. Wel, these louers thus agréeing, broke off from their parle for feare of suspicion, and ioined with companie, where falling into other talke, we past away the afternoone in many pleasant deuices. Eriphila and Meribates thus satisfied, liuing in most happy content, honoring no deity but Venus, determined as well as opportunity would minister occasion to breake the matter to mee and

Yea so impatient was her affection, as shee could not for beare to giue him such lookes; that the Gentleman perceiued shee was either resolued to outface him, or else affected towards him.

had set as a prize: so that he began to frequent the Court, and became a Courtier, first brauing it amongst the Lords, then by degrées créeping into fauour with the Ladies, where in time he found opportunity to parle with Eriphila, whom for fashion sake at the first hee found somewhat strange, but in short time became so tractable, that there was but one heart in two bodies; in so much, that not only Meribates and my sonne, but all the whole Court saw how Eriphila doted on Lucidor, whereat my sonne beganne to frowne, but Meribates would not see it, lest his Mistris should thinke him iealous, but smothered vp the griefe in secrecie, and thought either time, or the perswasion of her friends, or his continued affection would disswade her from her follies.

               To be briefe, so many faces, so many fancies, that shee became as variable in her loues, as the Polype in colours: which so perplexed the minde of Meribates, that falling into melancholy and grieuous passions, he exclaimed against the inconstancie of women, who like Fortune stood vpon a globe, and were winged with the feathers of ficklenesse: yet not willing to rage too far, till hee had talked with Eriphila, hee would not stay till opportunity would serue, but early in a morning stepped into her bed-chamber, where finding her betweene halfe sleeping and waking he saluted with great courtesie; being resaluted againe of Eriphila with the like priuate kind of familiaritie: after a few ordinary spéeches, Meribates taking Eriphila by the hand, began to vtter his mind in these words.

                  ller, to ye other side of the bed, she bade him good morrow: he passing away out of the chamber in great melancholy, began assoon as he was alone to exclame against the inconstancy of women: saying, they were like marigolds, whose forme turneth round with the sunne: as wauering as wethercoks, that mooue with euery winde: as fléeting as the Northwest Ilands, that flote with euery gale: wittie, but in wiles: conceited, but in inconstancy: as brittle as glasse, hauing their harts fram'd of the Polipe stones: their faces of the nature of the Adamants, and in quality like the Iacinth, which when it seemeth most hot, is then as cold as Iron: carrying frownes in their foreheads, and dimples in their chéekes: hauing their eyes framed of Iette, that drawe euery beauty in a minute, and let them fall in a moment. Thus he exclaimed against women: but such was his feruent affection towards Eriphila, that he would neither rage against her openly nor secretly, but smothered his passions in silence, which growing to the extreme, brought him into a feuer, wherein lingring awhile, he dyed: but in such sort, that all Taprobane said, it was for the inconstancy of Eriphila. Wel. his Gentlemen and mariners mourned and sorrowed, in that their Pynace should bring him home dead, whome t

            The third Discourse, of MARPESIA.
            NO sooner was the day vp, and Phoebus had marched out the greatest gates of heauen, lighting the world with the sparkling wreath, circled about his head, but old Alcida got vp, and called me from my bedde: ashamed that old age should bee more early then youth, I start vp to waite vpon mine Oastesse, who being readie with her staffe in her hand, carried me forth into the fields hard adioining to the Sea side, where wee came to a tombe, on which lay the picture of a Gentleman very artificially carued: by him hung two tables without any simbole, embleme imprest, or other Hierogliphicall caracter, onely there were written certaine verses to this effect.
            
               The Graces in their glorie neuer gaue
               A rich or greater good to womankind:
               That more impall's their honors with the Palme,
               Of high renowne then matchlesse constancie.
               Beauty is vaine, accounted but a flowre,
               Whose painted hiew fades with the summer sunne:
               Wit oft hath wracke by selfe-conceit of pride.
               Riches is trash that fortune boasteth on.
               Constant in loue who tries a womans minde,
               Wealth, beautie, wit, and all in her doth find.
            
            
               In the other table were set downe these verses.
            
               The fairest Iem oft blemisht with a cracke,
               Loseth his beauty and his vertue too:
               The fairest flowre nipt with the winters frost,
               In shew seemes worser then the basest weede.
               Vertues are oft farre ouerstain'd with faults,
               Were she as faire as Phoebe in her sphere,
               Or brighter then the paramour of Mars,
               Wiser then Pallas daughter vnto Ioue,
               Of greater maiestie then Iuno was,
               More chaste then Vesta goddesse of the Maides,
               Of greater faith then faire Lucretiá:
               Be she a blab, and tattles what she heares,
               Want to be secret giues farre greater staines,
               Then vertues glorie which in her remaines.
            
            After I had read ouer the verses; Alcida sayd: (sonne) I perceiue thou dost muse at this tombe, set in so vncoth a place, hard by the steepe-downe cliffes of the Sea: especially, furnished with Enigmaticall posies: yet hast thou not considered what after thou shalt finde, and therefore let vs sit downe vnder the shadowe of this Rose tree, which thou seest

               The third Historie of MARPESIA of Taprobane.
               
               MY two daughters beeing thus metamorphosed, and transformed for their follies into strange shapes: I had left mee onely my youngest daughter Marpesia, in face little inferiour to her eldest sister Fiordespine, for shee was passing bea

                  ll: wise she was, as not second to Eriphila, but other speciall vertues she had, that made her famous through all Taprobane: and as the burnt childe dreads the fire, and other mens harmes learne vs to beware: so my daughter Marpesia, by the misfortune of Fiordespine, feared to be proud, and by the 
                     •…
                  nister chance of Eriphila, hated to be inconstant, insomuch, that fearing their natiuities to be fatall, and that hers being rightly calculated would proue as bad as the rest: Shée kept such a strict method of her life and manners, and so foregarded all her actions with vertue, that she thought shee might despise both the fates and fortune.
               Liuing thus warily, I and her brother conceiued great content in her modestie and vertue: thinking, though the gods had made vs infortunate by the mishappe of the other two: yet in the fortunate successe of Marpesias life, amends should bee made for the other mishap. Perswaded thus, it fortuned that my sonne intertained into his seruice the son of a Gentleman, a bordering neighbour by, a youth of greater beauty then birth, for hee was of comely personage: of face louely, and though but meanly brought vp, as nusled in his fathers house: yet his nature discouered that hee was hardie in his resolution touching courage: and courteous in disposition, as concerning his manners.
               
                  This youth, called Eurimachus, was so diligent and dutifull towards his lord, so affable to his fellows, and so gentle to euery one, that hee was not onely well thought on by some, but generally liked and loued of all. Continuing in this method of life, hee so behaued himselfe, that in recompence of his seruice, my sonne promoted him not onely to higher office and some small pension, but admitted him into his secret and priuate 
                     •…
                  amiliarity. Liuing thus in great credit, it chanced that Venus seeing how my daughter Marpesia liued carelesse of her loues, and neuer sent so much as one sigh to Paphos for a sacrifice: shee called Cupid, complaining that shee was atheist to her deitie, and one opposed to her principles: whereupon the boy at his mothers becke, drewe out an inuenomed arrow, and leuelling at Marpesia, hit her vnder the right pappe, so nigh the heart, that giuing a grone she felt she was wounded, but how, or with what, she knew not; as one little skilfull in any amorous passions: yet shee felt thoughts vnfitting with her wonted humor, for noting the person of Eurimachus, which she found in property excellent, and admiring the qualities of his minde, co-vnited with many rare and precious vertues, which she perceiued to bee extraordinarie, she fell to conceiue a liking, which for the basenesse of his birth, shee passeth ouer as a toy: but the blinded wagge, that suffers not his wounds to bee cured with easie salues, nor permitteth any lenitiue plaisters to preuaile where hee pierceth with his arrowes, put oyle in the flame, and set fire to the flaxe, that she felt her fancy scarce warme, to grow to such a scalding heate, as euery veine of her heart swet passions: feeling this new lord, called loue, to be so imperious, shee stooped a little, and entred into deeper consideration of Eurimachus perfection, and so deepe by degrees, that although shee coueted with the Snaile to haue her pace slow, yet at length she waded so farre, that she was ouer her shooes: so that feeling her selfe passing into an vnknowne forme, shée fell into this doubtfull meditatiou.
               
                  What flame is this Marpesia, that ouer heateth thy hart? what strange fire hath Venus sent from Cipres, that scorcheth thee heere in Taprobane? hath Cupids bowe such strength; or his arrowes such flight, as being loosed in heauen, hee can strike here vpon earth? a mighty goddesse is Venus, and great is Cupid that work effects of such strange operation: make not a doubt (Marpesia) of that is palpable: dreame not at that which thou seest with thine eyes, nor muse not at that which thou feelest with thy heart: then confesse and say thou art in loue, and loue in thee, so deeply as Pumice-stones of reason will hardly raze out the characters. In loue? thou art young Marpesia, so is Cupid, a very childe? a maid, so was Venus before shee lost her Uirginitie, and yet for her lightnesse, shee was the goddesse of loue: but with whom art thou in loue? with Eurimach! one of base birth, and small liuing; of no credite, a meane Gentleman, and thy brothers seruant?
               Consider Marpesia, that loue hath his reasons, and his rules to settle fancy, and gouerne affections: honour ought not to looke lower in dignitie, nor the thoughts of Ladies gaze at worthlesse persons: Better is it for thee to perish in high desires, then in lowe disdaine: oppose thy selfe to Venus, vnlesse her presents be more precious: say loue is folly, except her gifts be more rich: count rather to dye in despising so meane a choice, then liue in liking so vnlikely a chance: what will thy mother, thy brother, thy friends; nay all Taprobane say: but that thou art vaine, carelesse, and amorous: but note this Marpesia, loue is a league that lasteth while life: thou art in this to feede thine eye, not thine humour: to satisfie the desire of thy heart, not the consideration of their thoughts: for in marying, either a perpetuall content, or a general mistike is like to fall to thy selfe: what though he be poore, yet hee is of comely personage: though he be base of birth, yet he is wise: what hee wanteth in gifts of fortune, hee hath in the minde: and the defect of honours is supplied with vertues.
               
                  
                  Venus her selfe loued Adonis: Phoebe stooped from heauen to kisse a poore Shepheard, AEnone loued Paris, as hee was a Swaine, not as the son of Priamus: loue is not alwaies companion to dignity, nor fancy euer lodged in kings Palaces. Then Marpesia, looke at Eurimachus, for hee is courteous, and loue him as he is vertuous; supply thou his want with thy wealth, and increase his credite with thy countenance: but how dare he motion loue, that is so low? or enterprise to attempt so great an assault? Neuer stand in doubt Marpesia, giue him thou but fauors, and loue and fortune will make him bold.
               
                  Marpesia hauing thus meditated with her selfe, sought by all meanes possible, how to make him priuy to her affections: she vsed in her salutations affable courtesie, and somwhat more then ordinary: her lookes were full of fauours, her glances many and milde; he vsed no exercise but she did commend, nor performed any thing, which shee sayd not to be excellent. The young Eurimachus was not such a Nouice, but hee could espie a pad in the straw, and discerne a glowing coale, from colde cinders: hee noted her glances, her looks, her gestures, her words, examining euery particular action, in the depth of his thoughts, finding by the touchstone, that all tended vnto meere loue, or extreme dissimulation; for whatsoeuer she did was in extremes. Well, hope put him in comfort that shee was too vertuous to dissemble; and feare, that she was too honorable to loue so base a man: yet supposing the best, he tooke her passions for loue, &amp; had a desire to return a liking with affection: but the consideration of his parentage, of his small possessions, of her honour, his lords disfauour, and the impossibility of his sute, was a cooling card to quench the hottest flame that Cupid could set on fire with his inchanted brand: but Venus had pittied the fondling, gaue him such precious comfortiues to incourage her champion, that he resolued to attempt whatsoeuer his fortune were: thus in suspence he began to debate with himselfe.

               In this melancholy humour he left his loues, and went to his labours. Loue espying how in the day he withstood her face with diligence, she caused Morpheus to present him in his sléepes with the shape of his Mistresse, which recording in the day, hee found that where fancie had pierced deepe, there no salue would serue to appease the Maladie: that from these light paines, he fell into extreme passions. As he could take no rest, he sought alwaies to be solitary, so to féed his thoughts with imaginations, that like Cephalus, he delighted to walke in the Groues, and there with Philomela to bewaile his loues.
               
                  Cupid pittying his plaints, sent opportunity to find her, who brought it so to passe, that as (on a day) he walked into a place (hard adioining to the parke, hauing his Lute in his hand, playing certaine melancholy dumpes, to mitigate his pinching humor) Marpesia with one of her Gentlewomen, being abroad in the lanes, espsed him thus solitary: stealing therefore behind him to heare what humor the man was in, heard him sing to his Lute this mornefull madrigall.
               
                  Rest thee desire, gaze not at such a Starre,
                  Sweet fancy sleepe, loue take a nappe a while:
                  My busie thoughts that reach and rome so farre,
                  With pleasant dreames the length of time beguile.
                  Faire Venus coole my ouer-heated brest,
                  And let my fancy take her wonted rest.
               
               
                  Cupid abroad was lated in the night:
                  His wings were wet with ranging in the raine:
                  Harbour he sought, to me he tooke his flight,
                  To drie his plumes: I heard the boy complaine,
                  
                     My doore I oped to grant him his desire,
                  And rose my selfe to make the Wagge a fire.
               
               
                  Looking more narrow by the fires flame,
                  I spyed his quiuer hanging at his backe:
                  I fear'd the child might my misfortune frame,
                  I would haue gone for feare of further wracke;
                  And what I drad (poore man) did me betide,
                  For foorth he drew an arrow from his side.
               
               
                  He pierst the quicke that I began to staŕt,
                  The wound was sweete, but that it was too hie,
                  And yet the pleasure had a pleasing smart:
                  This done, he flyes away, his wings were drie,
                  But left his arrow still within my brest,
                  That now I greeue, I welcom'd such a ghest.
               
               He had no sooner ended his sonet, but Marpesia perceiuing by the contents, that it was meant of her, stepped to him, and draue him thus abruptly from his passions.
               If you grieue Eurimachus, for intertaining such a ghest, your sorrow is like the raine that came too late: to beléeue, loue is such an vnruly tenant, that hauing his entrance vpon courtesie, he will not bee thrust out by force; you make me call to mind the counterfait of Paris, when he was AEnones darling: for Phidias drew him sitting vnder a Béech trée, playing on his pipe, and yet teares dropping from his eyes, as mixing his greatest melody with passions: but I see the comparison will not hold in you, for though your instrument bee answerable to his, yet you want his lukewarme drops, which sheweth, though your musike bee as good, yet your thoughts are not so passionate: but leauing these ambages, say to me Eurimachus; what may she bee that is your Mistresse?
               
                  Eurimachus amazed at the sight of his Ladie, more then Priamus sonne was at the view of the three goddesses;

sate still like the picture of Niobe turned into marble, as if some strange apoplexy had taken all his senses. Gaze on her face hee did: speake hee could not, in so much that Marpesia smiling at the extremity of his loues, wakened him out of this trance, thus:
               What cheere man, hath loue so witched thy heart, as all thy sences haue left their powers? is thy tong tied, as thy heart is fettered, or hath the feare of your mistris cruelty driuen you into a cold palsie? if this be the worst, comfort your selfe, for women will be true: and if shee be too hard hearted, let me but know her, and you shall see how I will prattle on your behalfe; what say you to me, what makes you thus mute?
               By this Eurimachus had gathered his sences together, that rising vp and doing reuerence to Marpesia, he thus replyed: Madam, it is a principle in Philosophy, that Sensibile sensui superpositū nulla fit sensasio, the colour clapt to the eye, hind

I dare not madam, quoth Eurimachus, infer what I would; but to answere more plainly, Endimion waking, and feeling Phebe grace him with a kisse, was not more amazed, than I at your heauenly presence, fearing, if not Acteons fall, yet that I had committed the like fault: for at the first blush your excellency draue me into such a maze, that I dreamed not of the Lady Marpesia, but of some goddesse that had solaced in these woods, which supposition made me so mute.
               You fly still (quoth Marpesia) from my demand, playing like the Lapwing that cryeth farthest from her nest. I asked who it was that you loued so, as to honour her with such a sonet.
               It was, Madam, to kéepe accord to my lute, not to discouer any passions, for all the amordelayes Orpheos

young to loue, for feare my youth be ouerbidden; fancy being so heauy a burden, that Hercules (who could on his shoulder sustaine the heauens) groned to beare so weighty a lode.
               If then, Madame, I striue aboue my strength, especially in loue, I shall but with the Giants heape Peleon vpon Ossa, passions vpon passions, so long till I be 
                     •…
                  rooken to death with loues thundering bolt: therefore, Madame, I dare not loue.
               
                  Marpesia, who determined to sound the depth of his thoughts, tooke him before hee fell to the ground, and made this reply: Trust mee Eurimachus, your looks, your actions, your sighes and gesture, argues no lesse than a louer: therefore seeing we are alone, none but we thrée, Ile haue you once in shrift, and therefore I coniure you by your Mistresse fauour and beautie, to tell me whether you be in loue or no.
               You straine me so hard, Madam, (quoth Eurimachus) that I am in loue, and loue so farre in mee, as neither time nor fortune can raze out: the name of my mistresse, Madam, pardon, for in naming her I discouer mine owne presumption, hauing aymed so by the meanes of aspiring loue, as her excellency crosseth all my thoughts with disdaine: For Madam, giue me leaue to say (making no compare) that the Graces at her birth did agree to make her absolute: I hauing soared so high, as the sunne hath halfe melted my feathers, I feare with Icarus to fall into the Ocean of endlesse miseries; for be her disdaine neuer so great, yet my desire will neuer belesse, scorne she I should looke so hie; affection will not bate an ounce of his maine: but seeing the dice be in his hands, will throw at all.
               But Madam, so farre I am out of 
                     〈◊〉
                   to haue but one fauour at her hands, as I passe euery day and houre in as 
                     〈◊〉
                   perplexed estate, as the ghosts greened by the infernall furies: and with this the water stood in his eyes, which Marpesia not able to brooke, began to salue thus.
               
                  I will not Eurimachus, be inquisitiue of your Mistresse name, sith you haue yeelded a reason to conceale it, but for your loues that are lodged so hie, feare not man; the Blacksmith dared to couet faire Venus; the little Sparrow pecketh sometimes wheat, the Eagle taketh stand; and the little Mouse feedeth, where the Elephant hath eaten hay: loue as soone stoopeth to visite a poore cottage, as a Palace: to dare, I tell thee Eurimachus, in loue, is the first principle: and Helena told Paris:
               
               Nemo succenset amanti.
               Thou must then to Paphos, and not vse bashfulnesse in Venus temple: sacrifices serue at her altars, as a thing vnfit for louers; and be she as high of degree as any in Taprobane, court her Eurimachus, and if thou misse, it is but the hap that louers haue. As shee should haue prosecuted her talke, her brother who was stalking to kill a Déere, came by, and espying them at so priuate and familiar chat, frowned, commanding Eurimachus (as halfe in anger) to get him home: hee leauing his sport, accompanied my daughter to the court.
               These louers thus parted, were not long ere they met, where Eurimachus following the precepts of Marpesia, began very boldly to giue the assault, she very faintly, for fashion sake, making a womans resistance, but the batterie was so freshly renewed, that Marpesia yeelded, and there they plighted a constant promise of their loues: vowing such saith and loyaltie as the troth of two louers heart? might afford.
               In this happie content they liued along while, till Marpesia blabbing the contract out to a gentleman of the court, it came to her brothers and her mothers eare, who taking the matter grieuously, had her strictly in examination. Marpesia confessed her loues, and maintained them: on the contrary

side, they perswaded with promises, and threatned with bitter spéeches: but in vaine, for Marpesia was resolued and tolde for a flat conclusion, Eurimachus was the man, and none but he. Whereupon, my sonne seeing no means could preuaile to remoue her affection, he thought by taking away the cause, to raze out the effects: and therfore he sent for Eurimachus, whom after he had nipped vp with bitter taunts, he banished from the Court.
               This being grieuous to the two louers, yet the assurance of each others constancie, and the hope in time to haue the Prince reconciled, mitigated some part of their martyrdome: and Marpesia, to shew to the world shee was not fleeting, whatsoeuer her friends said, discouered the grief she conceiued by his absence openly, for she went apparelled in mourning attire. Well, Eurimachus thus banished, went home to his father, who for feare of ye prince, durst not entertaine him, which vnkindnesse had doubled his griefe, that he fell almost frantike, and began to leaue the company of men as a flat Timonist: in which humor, meeting with the Gentleman that bewraid their loues, he fought with him and slew him, and buried him so secretly as the care of his owne life could deuise.
               Well, Cleander was mist, but heare of him they could not; Postes were sent out, messengers through all Taprobane, but no newes, so that diuerse did descant diuersly of his departure; some said he was vpon secret displeasure betweene him and the Prince, passed out of the land: others, that he was slaine by theeues: some that hee was deuoured by wild beasts. Thus debating of his absence, he was generally lamented of all the court.
               But (leauing the supposition of his death) againe to Marpesia, who taking the exile of Eurimachus to her heart, began to growe into great and extreme passions, and for griefe of the minde, to bodily disease, that she fell into a Quartaine, which so tormented her, as the Physicians said, ther was no hope of life, nor no art to cure her disease

vnlesse her minde were at quiet: whereupon her brother fearing his sisters life, recalled home Eurimachus, admitted him into great fauour, and gaue frée grant of his goodwill to their marriage.
               Upon this, Marpesia growing into a content, in short time amended. After shee had recouered her health, shee dayly vsed the company of Eurimachus very priuately and familiarly, but she found him not the man he was before: for before he was exiled, no man more pleasant nor more merrily conceited; now none more melancholly nor fuller of dumps, vttering farre fetcht sighes, and vncertaine answers, so that it discouered a minde greatly perplexed. Marpesia noting this, being on a day all alone with Eurimachus in his chamber, shee sought with faire intreaties and sweete dalliance, to wring out the cause of his sorrowes, protesting, if shee could, euen with the hazard of her life redresse it: if not, to participate in griefe some part of his distresse.
               
                  Eurimachus, that loued her more than his life, although hee knew womens tongues were like the leaues of the Aspe tree, yet thinking her to bee wise, after a multitude of mortall sighes, hee discoursed vnto her, how hee had 
                     •…
                  aine Cleander, and that the remembrance of his death bred this horror in his conscience.
               
                  Marpesia hearing this, made light of the matter, to comfort Eurimachus, promising and protesting to kéepe it as secret as hitherto she had been constant. But shee no sooner was parted from her best beloued, but shee was with childe of this late and dangerous newes, laboring with great paines till shee might vtter it to her Gossips: where we may note, sonne (I speake against my selfe) that the closets of womens thoughts are euer open, that the depth of their heart hath a string that stretcheth to the tongues end, that with Semele they conceiue and bring forth oft before their time: which Marpesia tried true, for sitting one day solitarie with a Ladie in the court, called Celia,
                  
shee fetcht many pinching sighes, which Celia marking, desired her to tel her the cause of that late conceiued grief, as to a friend, in whose secresie she might repose her life. Marpesia made it somewhat coy and charie a great while, insomuch that Celia began to long; and therefore vrged her extremely. Marpesia could keep no longer, and therfore vsing this preamble, began to play the blabbe.
               If I did not, Madam Celia, take you for my second selfe, and thinke you to bee wise and secret, I would not reueale a matter of so great importance, which toucheth me as much as my life to conceale: Women, you know, hauing any thing in their stomake, long while they haue discourst it to some friend: taking you therefore for my chiefest, and hoping all shal be troden vnder foote, know Madam, that Eurimachus hath slaine Cleander, and that is the cause that makes him thus melancholy. Mary, God forbid (quoth Celia.) It is true Madam, quoth Marpesia, and therefore let whatsoeuer I haue said be buried in this place. With that I came into place, and they broke off their talke.
               
                  Celia longing to be out of the chamber, that shée might participate this newes to her Gosips, as soone as opportunity gaue her leaue, went abroad, &amp; méeting by chance another Gentlewoman of the Court, calling her aside, tolde her, if she would be secret, and sweare not to reueale it to any one, she would tell her strange newes: the other promising, with great prot
