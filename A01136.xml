            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

Yea, the Lorde him selfe in an other place sendeth vs backe to the scholing of the Law and the Prophets, as vnto infallible preceptes, and rules of pure and true doctrine. And albeit I may not denye that testimonie of S. Paul to be most true, where he sayth, That faith is a gift of God, yssuing from his free mercy &amp; bountie: yet doth he not: thereby meanewhyles exclude other lawfull and ordinarie meanes, taught for the better attainement thereof. As where he sayeth, Fayth commeth by hearing, &amp; hearing by the word of God. So that their error is so much the more blameworthy,Fides implicita. who contented with that intricate, and confused faith (as they tearme it)



be of opinion, that to the rude &amp; vnlettered people, sufficeth ynough to beleeue those things onely, that all other men do beleeue. But this common faith seemed not sufficient to the auncient fathers, in that purer age of the primitiue &amp; Apostolique Church: who though mistrusted not the lessons &amp; instructions of the Apostles, yet were they also in this respect adiudged prayseworthy, because they did conferre the doctrine, which they receyued of the Apostles, with the bookes of the Law, and the prophets: which obseruatiō of the elders was of no smal importaunce, to procure credite to the establishment of faith. But the state of Christianitie is nowe come (I know not to what passe) that this Christian faith, which behoued to be most deepely engrauen in the hearts of euery of vs, is either not so well garnyshed in manye of vs, as it ought to be: in others very faynt and feeble: and in some others skarse any resemblaunce at all appearing, which slender portion and sparkle of faith, be it neuer so small, as is not altogether to be reiected, so neyther is this wonderfull sluggishnes, and retcheles securitie of the men in our age, in any respect tolerable: of whome some ouergreedily busied



in worldly affaires, some feeding their fansies vpon fonde delights, do either make no estimate at al, of that inestimable Iewel of faith, which only enricheth to the inheritaunce of eternall life, or at the least, are not so diligent searchers of the same, as they ought to be. To clime vnto honour, what attemptes and toyle do some vndertake? howe filthily do others turmoyle them selues, in raking riches together? how dayntily some men besmeare them selues in perfumes, and pleasures? who because they knowe, they can not lyue here for euer, &amp; do determine to liue godly neuer, yeeld them selues wholly to liue delicately &amp; wantonly. To be aduaunced in Court, to aspire to prelacie and ecclesiasticall dignitie, &amp; to be a magistrat ouer the multitude, who doth not accōpt it matter most honorable? who adiudgeth not that man to be most fortunate, that by hooke or crooke hath cratcht wonderfull possessions together? who thinketh not that man to be most happy, that lyueth most pleasurably? And what shal I say of those artes &amp; sciences, which procure gaineful lucre, &amp; estimation of the world? wherin whyles wee sweate and swinke all our lyues long, scarse one minute can bee spared, no



thought employed to the things which lead vnto Christ. I speake not of them, who seme to sauour of no sappe of religion, nor are endued with one drop of faith: who resembling rather Diagoristes and Protagoristes, then Christians, are so vtterly fallen from Christianisme, to Atheisme, that, measuring this life with the present pleasures thereof, they doe beleeue nothing holy, good, or worthy to be embraced, but those plausible workes &amp; obiects of nature, wherewith our eyes &amp; senses are delyghted most. There is also an other crewe &amp; company, not much vnlike to these other, who perceyuing Christian religion assaulted, rackt, and rent in sonder (as they say) with sects, schismes and contrarieties of opinions, do persuade them selues that religion to be best, that will acquaint it selfe with no religion at all.
                  What shall I say of them, wherof the nomber is exceeding great, who with full mouth do professe true religion it selfe, and will not deny, but that they do beleeue in Iesu Christ: but beyng demaunded, wherefore they doe beleeue in him: what the will of God the father in Christ is: what Grace is: what &amp; how great promises are layde vp in stoare for vs



in Christ: howe glorious the Maiestie &amp; royaltie of Christes kingdome is: how inestimable the glorie of his riches be: what is the breadth, the length, the depth &amp; the heyght thereof: howe woonderfull the loue of his knowledge is: how great the force &amp; power of faith is: and vpon what principal pillers &amp; foundations it is buylded, they can render scarse any reason at all. For as much therfore as the infallible certeintie, &amp; true vnderstanding of these thinges can be attayned vnto rightly, from no where els, then from the holy closets of sacred Scriptures: it shalbe very requisite and needefull, that euery of vs employ al our senses &amp; povvers of the mind, continually exercised in the same. For howsoeuer Christian diuinitie is tossed, and turmoyled to &amp; fro, with innumerable intricate entangled and wandering questions, yet remayneth faith one selfe same neuerthelesse both pure &amp; simple: and as it is but one, so ought all men necessarily be endued therewith wholly
                        •
                      That is to say, that we all know Christ, that we repose all our ankerholde of affiaunce in Christ, &amp; that we imprint Christ in the bowels of our soule, as wee are commaunded by the mouth of God the father,



seeing there is no name besides this name giuen vnder heauen, in whome the treasure &amp; hope of mans felicitie may safely shroude it selfe. Let Princes therefore learne to know this Christ: Let subiects attend vpon him: let auncient fathers take hold of him: Let yong men embrace him: Let the riche enlarge their treasury with this precious Iewel: &amp; let the poore seek their reliefe to be refreshed by him: who in deed cā els where by no meanes be found more easily, then in the very sacred wellspringes of the propheticall Scriptures: notwithstanding who so is desirous to procure this ioyfull Iewel, must first of necessitie make earnest and diligent searche therfore. For this precious pearle is not allotted to any, but vnto them, that vvill searche for it: nor doth this heauēly Manna feede any, but the hungry. The soule must be very thirstie, that must taste of this liquour that gusheth frō out the cōduyte pipes of eternal life. This gate is not opened to the lazy &amp; slouthfull droane, but vnto him that wil knocke. Knocke (sayth he) and it shalbe opened vnto you. Seeke, and ye shall finde.

but all catch it not, except such as scratche and offer force for it: for what (I beseeche you) is more forcible then fayth? what more mightie, if it be true faith, if it be liuely faith, yea if it be true Christian fayth? as that which displaying banner vnder his captaine Christ, doeth fight in heauen, and combat in the ayre, against the princes and powers of the ayre, against spiritual wickednesses from aboue: doeth keepe continuall warres against infinite hazards in the earth, and in hell agaynst Beelzebub, agaynst the furies &amp; gates of the hells, yea against death fighteth for eternall life, against the Law for righteousnes, and against horror of conscience for freedome and peace.
                  Therefore considering this faith is of such power and efficacie, yea so necessarie to be frequented in all the actions of mans lyfe: what remayneth from henceforth, but that all and euery of vs, crye out vnto the same Christ, and beseeche him to impart vnto vs, the true knowledge and vnderstanding of him selfe, to enlighten the glimmering sight of our dazeled fleshly eyes, with the most bryght and orient beames of this gladsome saith, and that he wil vouchsafe at length, to



bring that to passe in vs, that he vsed sometimes with his Apostles, when as he discouered vnto them vpon the way, as they trauayled, the holie Scriptures? For so we reade, And he, beganne at Moses, and at all the Prophets, and interpreted vnto them in all the scriptures, the things which were written of him.
                     Luke .24. And immediately after, Then opened hee their vnderstanding, that they might know the Scriptures, &amp; said vnto them, Thus it is written. Whereby appeareth playnly, the duetie and office that is required in the expositours of the holy Scriptures: To witte, that omitting all superfluous circumlocutions, and vnprofitable quiddities of questions, they instruct the people in those principles, &amp; rules of the Scriptures chiefely, which auaile most to the nourishment and encrease of faith. In which kinde of argument, forasmuch as in this sermon behoued me to frame my simple skill, according to the estate of the present matter, and opportunitie of time, and that it seemed good to my friendes, to haue this litle treatise published in print, to the viewe of the common people, as not altogether vnworthy the reading: I haue yeelded to their request, that it myght be imprinted: And although my meaning was at the first, to haue



the same directed to the behoof of the Iewes chiefely, yet (I trust) it vvil not be altogether vnprofitable to the Christian readers. First, because it may so be, yea I feare me, may also iustly be feared, lest amongst the nomber of thē, which say that they beleue in Christ, some happely vvil be found, in vvhose lippes onely this faith rolleth at large, and hath not yet pearced any deeper, nor taken roote in their heartes, nor are as yet so sufficiently learned, as (if matter come to tryall and proofe) they can render a true and vndoubted reason of this their faith. Moreouer, admitte that a man stande assured and stedfast in the certeintie of his faith, yet vvhat faith is there so sure, constant and vnuanqui

                     able, but may be made more stable and perfect? For if S. Paul did see sometime as in a darke ryddle: if the Apostles (notvvithstanding so many miracles vvrought in their sight) needed yet the interpretation of Scriptures: if those vvhich receaued the vvoorde by the preaching of Paul,Act .17. did neuerthelesse cōferre his doctrine vvith the Scriptures, to see, whether they agreed together
                        •
                      as is recorded in the Actes of the Apostles: vvhat shoulde let vs to doe the like? that by this meanes, vve



also myght encrease dayly, from fayth to faith. Finally for as much as our auncient &amp; deadly enemie doeth not more cruelly maligne, nor more outragiously assaile any one thing, so much, as this our faith in Christ: surely I iudge this aboue all other most requisite, that euery of vs haue especial regard, to be (as much as is possible) armed and garded vvith this target of faith, that vve may couragiously encounter all attempts and assaults of the deuill: vvhereunto hovve auaylable this litle Sermon vvill be, I knovv not: that let Christ our Lorde him selfe see vnto, and giue his mercifull ayde therein. I for my slender capacitie, haue perfourmed vvhat I vvas able, and as much as the Lorde graunted me: vvhome I most heartily beseeche, to blesse and encrease thy holy studies (godly Reader) and to direct the same to the honour &amp; glory of his name.

                  A Sermon of the true and gladsome Oliue tree, mentioned in the Epistle of Sainct Paul to the Romanes, chap. xi. preached at London by a faithfull Minister of God, Iohn Foxe, at the christening of a certaine Iewe, translated out of Latine into Englishe.
                  FIrst, as duetie requireth, I do yeeld most humble thāks to our Lorde and Sauiour Christ Iesu, whome it hath pleased of his vnsearcheable mercie and bountifull loue towardes vs, to minister so notable an occasion of our assembly, this present day, &amp; place: and so fruitefull an argument for mee to empart vnto you all. Secondly, I doe no lesse heartily thanke, then woorthily commend in the Lord, all you that are present, who, according to your accustomed maner, are so willingly and ioyfully gathered together, enduced hereunto, not through any vayne delight of fonde noueltie, but of a seryons, and studious zeale of godlinesse, not as gazers of friuolous fantasticall fables, but as willing witnesses of this great and inestimable benefite



of almightie God. Lastly, I do from the bottome of my heart reioyce in the behalfe of this person, for whose cause we are as nowe mette here together, who being transported from out the vttermost parts of Barbarie into England, and conuersant amongest vs, by the space of sixe whole yeeres, renouncing nowe at the last the naturall contumacie of his natiue country, doth with so earnest bent affection of voluntarie wil, chearefully desire to become a member of Iesu Christ, and to be made partaker of his holye congregatio

And withall I most humbly beseeche Almightie God, that he will not onely vouchsafe his gracious encrease to this glorious worke begunne with this Israelite stranger, but also to allure the whole remnant of the circumcised Race, by this his example, to be desirous of the same communion: So that at the length, all nations, as well Iewes, as Gentiles, embracing the faith, and Sacramentes of Christ Iesu, acknowledging one Shephearde, vnited together in one sheepefold, may with one voice, one soule, and one generall agreemēt, glo

it may please him of his singular clemencie to graunt the same, as also to blesse these our dayes with quiet calme, and ioyfull tranquillitie, which we doe nowe enioy vnder the gouernmēt of our most gracious Souereigne, and her most honorable Magistrates, I beseeche you of your charitie, to ioyne with me in heart and minde vnto the eternall God father of vs all, with the same prayer which his onely begotten sonne taught vs in the Gospell.

                     Forsamuch as in the administration of the Sacraments of the Church, I doe well perceiue that both by the word of God, and by an auncient and solemne custome amongst many, it hath bene an vse to haue somewhat, for the better instruction of their auditories, read and expounded out of the bookes of holie scripture: and deliberating likewise with my selfe, what course I might best keepe at this present, as well to serue the offred opportunitie, as also to satisfie the publique commodity of you al chiefly: I could not determine vpō any one text of ye whole scripture to be opened vnto you, more profitable for your learning, more effectuall for exhortation, more



applyable to our age, and more agreeable for this present occasion, then the sentence of S. Paul the Apostle, not very long, but of wō

For if the first fruits be holy, the whole masse is holy also: And if the Roote be holy, the braunches will be holye also: And if some of the braunches be broken of, and thou beyng a wilde Oliue tree, wast graffed in amongest them, and made partaker of the



Roote and fatnesse of the true and naturall Oliue tree, boaste not thy selfe agaynst the braūches, for if thou do boaste, thou bearest not the roote, but the roote beareth thee. Thou wilt say then, The braunches are broken of, that I may be engraffed in. Thou sayest well: for vnbeliefe sake they were broken of: and thou stoodest stedfast in faith. Be not high minded therefore, but feare, for if God spared not the natural braunches: Take heed lest it come to passe, that he spare not thee. Behold the kindnesse &amp; rigor of God: vpon them which fel, rigor: but kindnesse towards thee, if thou perseuere in kindenesse: Or els thou shalt be hewen of, &amp; they, if they continue not still in vnbeliefe, shalbe engraffed in agayne. For God is of power to graffe thē in againe. For if thou were cut out of a naturall wilde Oliue tree, and contrary to nature were engraffed into the true Oliue tree, how much rather shall the braunches be graffed in agayne into their owne Oliue tree? For I woulde not haue you ignoraunt (brethren) of this mysterie, lest you should waxe proud in your owne conceytes, that blindnesse is partly happened vnto Israel, vntill the fulnes of the Gentiles be accomplished, and so all

                        Dearely beloued, you haue heard what the Apostle of the Gentiles doth speake vnto vs Gentiles, you haue heard his discourse of the Iewes, of their vnbeliefe, and of their reiection: you haue heard the doctrine, and comparison of S. Paul, touching the true Oliue tree, and the wylde Oliue tree: touching the natural branches, and the graftes: touching faith, and infidelitie: touching the mercie of God, and the seueritie of his iustice: touching the modestie, and constancie of the faithfull: touching the fulnes of the Gentiles: finally, touching the last calling home and reclayming of the Iewes. This is a very large theame as ye see, and full of plentiful matter, which for the difficultie, as it seemeth to surmount my weakenes to reach vnto, so requireth your more careful attention, that ye may duely conceiue the same: in the debating whereof it behoueth me neither to say to litle, neither is there any vtterāce of man els able, for ye largenes of the matter exceeding al possibilitie, to speake sufficiently. Notwithstanding, sithence I haue presumed to enter



vpon this enterprise being of it selfe of wonderful importance, albeit I may seeme to folter and faint, as oppressed with the heauie burden thereof, yet will I not retyre, but will proceede with affiaunce as well as I may, resting my selfe wholy vpon the grace of Christ: and will (by your pacience) speake, though not so much, as the cause requireth, yet as much as the goodnes of God will permit at this present.
                     The whole action of the sermon of Paul is deuided into two speciall partes: whereof the one concerneth the Iewes: the other apperteineth properly to vs Gentiles. In the behalfe of the Iewes, he lamenteth their fall, reproueth their vnbeliefe, giueth them vnto vs for an example to beholde the seuere rigor of Gods iustice, discouereth the cause of gods wrath: and being carefull for their safetie, doeth prouoke them to an holy emulation: Finally, prophesying as it were of their last reconcilement, doth encourage the seely outcasts with hope of recouery of Gods mercy againe. As concerning the Gentiles, he commendeth their faith: aduanceth the inestimable goodnes of God towardes them: calleth them backe to remembrance of their former



miserie and despeired estate: reioyceth with them for their present felicitie: entirely requesteth, and earnestly exhorteth them, that they swell not with pride

                        The maner and kinde of his instruction here, wherein hee resembleth the Church of God to an Oliue tree, is metaphoricall, and



propheticall. Which Oliue tree consisteth of three partes:
                           The Oliue tree consisteth of three members: the roote, the stocke, &amp; the braunches.
                         Of the roote, of the stocke, and of the branches. Under the title of the Roote, he doeth note Abraham, and other holy Patriarches vnto vs, because in them appeared the first buddes and blossomes of Gods promise. By the stocke or body of the tree, he representeth vnto vs the Church scattered vpon the face of the earth, a congregation gathered together, out of the whole nomber of the faithful, which at the first, budding in smal issues from out that holy roote, and so by litle and litle, encreasing in strength, and obteining a proportionable stature

By which plaine demonstration, we haue an apparant view painted out, as it were, both of the old synagogue of the Iewes, and the new Church of the Gentiles. And because no man shall thinke that this Oliue tree is sprung vp at al aduentures, or planted by mans industrie: he calleth it by the name of an holy issue, out of a holy Roote. There is no man made husbandman or woodward of this Oliue t

Howsoeuer this Oliue tree doeth alter the beautie of his blossomes, or change the hewe of his leaues, yet endureth it still vnremoueable, nor is at any time

                         which being wholy established vpon the eternal foundation of Gods most sacred promise, standeth as it were in a certaine eternitie vnuanquishable, and so shal continue permanent beyond all ages, though the members and branches thereof, remaine not alwayes in one estate, and although it happen many times, that the first issues become the last, and contrariwise, the last made first: the naturall buddes yeeld place to the sauage slippes, the proper and olde growen branches are cut of, and new taken in: and so by wonderfull enterchange, some growe, some stand at a staye, some encrease, and some starue quite away, as we see now and then come to passe in husbandry and gardening, whereas plantes and trees are many times pruned of vnfruitefull sproutes, sometimes dispoyled altogether of bowes, and the stoc

newly engraffed, to the end the trees may become more fruitfull. After the same maner that heauenly gardiner, woodward, or plant setter doeth many times prune this litle Oliue tree of his Church, but neuer plucketh it vp by the rootes (as Augustine doeth witnes) cutting of eftsoones wyndshaken bowes and starued branches,

                         that new plantes may prosper the better. So that according to the saiyng of the same Augustine, many rauening wolues possesse the Church within, whiles many sheepe in the meane space stande without the doores. Which thing can be verified by no one example more aptly, then by this comparison of the Iewes and Gentiles. Of whom let vs heare what the Apostle speaketh.
                     
                        I speake (saith he) vnto you Gentiles, in as much as I am an Apostle of the Gentiles, I will magnifie mine office, &amp;c. Forasmuch as in debating of any matter in question whatsoeuer, two things are chiefely to bee noted, To wit, The person that speaketh, and the matter that is spoken of: we will by Gods assistance prosecute them both at this present. Let vs first therefore consider the person of him that speaketh: then, as order of teaching



requireth, the cause whereof he disputeth. As to
                           •
                        ching the cause here debated, as no reasonable man can make any iust quarrel to doubt vpon, so ought not the famous &amp; welknowen authoritie of the person be defrauded of anie his due estimation:
                           The authoritie of the person that speaketh.
                         for what authoritie can be of more force to purchase credite, or to procure aduancement to the function, then the name of an Apostle? And amongst the Apostles them selues also, what one ought to be more entire, and of more credite amongst the Gentiles, then the Apostle Paul? Who if being sent by mans ordinance had come vnto vs, ought yet to be friendly enterteined for his courtesie, so lōg as he teacheth the syncere trueth.

                         But whereas now he is by an especiall calling peculiarly assigned, not from men, nor by men, but by Christ Iesu him selfe, an Apostle to instruct vs Gentiles: howe much more behoueth vs Gentiles his scholers, to attend our owne proper scholemaster and peculiar Apostle, in as much as he was especially called and chosen for this only purpose, as he witnesseth of him selfe, that we shoulde with all faithfull chearefulnes of minde embrace his doctrine? Wherefore proceede on in Gods name, my deare beloued brethren: be

Which title notwithstanding hee boasteth not of vpon anie vaineglorious ostentation, but compelled hereunto through necessitie of circumstances only to magnifie his functiō. Neither is this any strange or new kind of doctrine: for ye necessary order of teaching so requireth oftentimes, for the more credite of the doctrine that is taught, to extoll and aduance aswel the office of the teacher, as also the authoritie of the office:

                           The first part concerning the Iewes and Gentiles.

In the first member whereof, which toucheth the Iewes, the seuere Iustice of God is noted vnto vs: in that other, that hath relation to the Gentiles, the vnspeakeable mercy and goodnesse of God is disclosed vnto vs.

For both those opinions are vtterly refuted by the Apostle: the one in the beginning of the Chapter: that o

meare straungers to infidelitie, whose fayth if it should be placed in the face of the enemy, wil of very cowardize forthwith flee ye fielde?
                     And albeit al these examples of vnbeliefe, whereof I haue made mencion, may iustly be reproued as blame worthy, &amp; voyd of al color of defence, yet may they be borne withal after a sort. But this kind of infidelitie of al others is most horrible &amp; execrable, when as men do rushe headlong into such obstinate resistance, that they wil not only not acquaint thēselues with the trueth, being layd open before their eyes, but will wittingly shut vp their senses from the beholding thereof, because they will not see it, &amp; wil spourne thereat not in words and profession only, but wil cruelly persecute the same also wt al maner of outrage, slaughter &amp; blood, blasphemies &amp; most despiteful execrations. And this is that vnbeliefe, which being more noysome then any pestilēt botch, may rightly &amp; properly be called the Iewish Infidelitie, &amp; seemeth after a certaine maner their inheritable disease, who are after a certaine sort, from their mothers wombe, naturally caried through peruerse frowardnes, into all malitious hatred, &amp; contempt of Christ, &amp; his Christiās. And for this cause especially,



I suppose it came to passe, that wheras God so many hundred yeres before, had cōtinually pardoned their wōderful &amp; manifold wickednes &amp; impietie, &amp; after his wonted maner, had from time to time endured, &amp; winked at their horrible rebel

That they might perseuere still in sacrificing ye blood of goates and lambes to the Lorde? And where should this be done? in one family only? But God is not delighted with such sacrifices, nor dwelleth he in Temples made by men, but euen in the very hearts of men: he taketh no pleasure in externall pompe, and outwarde obser

First whereas hee alludeth and resembleth the cutting away of certein of the Iewes to certein branches of the true naturall Oliue tree, it appeareth hereby sufficiently, that this casting away apperteined not to the whole nation of the Iewes, but to some portion of them onely: for there remained as then many of the same kindred, amongst whom was S. Paul him selfe, &amp; the other Apostles, besides a very great portion of the remnant of the same people, which did folow Christ, &amp; did acknowledge him with all their faith. Againe the very first yssues of our Christian faith sprang out of that stocke, from whence we Gentiles must needs confesse to haue receiued the very entry and fundation therof. It appeareth therefore that this was not a general reiection, neither that the whole race was drawen all together into the same gulfe of perdition, but a portion onely, and the same Paul tearmeth them to haue bene cut of.

But a question may bee moued here perhappes, whether the Gentiles were not engraffed for their faiths sake? and whether the Iewes were not supplanted from the true Oliue for their vnbeliefe? which enterchanged dispensation, what els doeth it explane vnto vs, then a manifest demonstration as wel of the meritorious desert, as wel of faith, as of vnbeliefe?

                        The answere hereunto, first as concerning the faith of the Gentiles, and the infidelitie of the Iewes. I confesse in deede that these may seeme to carrie some shewe in the eyes, and iudgement of some to be deemed the very originall causes of the free acceptation of the Gent
                           •
                        les, and likewise of the repulse of the Iewes. But for all this we heare not yet, what were the causes of the faith of the one, and of the vnbeliefe of the other. And therefore if we will enter into a deepe and more especiall enquirie after the principall causes



of this action, truely we shal neuer find them els where, then in the hidden and secret closet of Gods election. For be it so admitted, that the Gentiles were for this cause engraffed into the true Oliue tree, because they did beleeue, yet if question be moued, from whence their faith proceeded first, it may well be answered, not from any their merites truely, neither in respect of any their own worthines more, then as the impes which do issue out of the naturall wylde Oliue tree, can boast of any their excellencie, wherefore they ought to be transplanted into the fatnes of the true Oliue tree. The like answere in senseable wise may suffice touching the Iewes, when as if the cause of their dismembring from their true naturall Oliue tree be enquired: I answere, For their vnbeliefe vndoubtedly: And yet this answere doth not satisfie the purpor
                           •
                         of Pauls disputation. For sithence faith is an especiall gift of God, issuing from out the only mercie and grace of God, and not from mans free choise, the question reboundeth backe againe from whence it began. What was the cause then why the natural branches were so bereft of this singular gift after the reueiling of their Meschias? whether because



the barren vnfruitefull wylde Oliue tree did furmount the true Oliue in excellencie of fatnes? to wit, in integritie of life and merits? surely I thinke not so. Wherefore then were the Iewes forsaken, and the Gentiles receiued? S. Paul maketh this answere. First, that this repulse reached not to al the Israelites in generall. Then, as concerning the remnant whatsoeuer worke was wrought in them, was not administred without the singular counsell and foreknowledge of God:
                           The foreknowledge and decree of God in casting away the Iewes.
                         which foreknowledge doth euidently appeare by the continuall discourse of the Prophets &amp; Psalmes: where the holy ghost foretelleth many hūdreth yeres before, of ye wilful blyndnes of the Iewes. This counsaile of God is made notably discernable vnto vs by the sequel, and finall cause, the Apostle not only testifying most euidently, that God was ye worker of their blindnes, but also rendring the reason that enduced God thereunto: where disputing at large of the rufull ruine of the Iewes, and searching for the cause thereof: What then? (saith he) did they therefore offend, because they shoulde bee cast-away? Which were as much to say, as though God should be delited in their destructiō, God forbid.



Nay rather, y• by their fal saluatiō should happen to the Gentiles: &amp; that by their vnbeliefe the Gentiles might obteine mercie.
                     
                     But question wilbe moued here againe,

                        Nay rather, for this cause only God did shut vp al vnder vnbelief, that he might haue mercy on al. For as it pleased almighty god to exercise his long &amp; seuere rigor in old time against the heathenish castawayes, and wretched abiects the Gentiles, vntill at length, wt his mercifull kindnes vnlooked for, he had shaken of from their eyes, the foggy skales of darkened errour, and after their long infidelitie, allured them at the last

                     Whereby it may easily appeare, how that there is no one thing, in all the actions of mans life, so plausible, whereby man may bee puffed vp to stand to much in his owne conceite, or disdainefully treade downe the infirmitie of his weake brethren, whether he haue regarde to the lenitie of Gods free mercy, or attentiuely beholde the seueritie of his iustice.



For so ye Apostle hath here set them out both vnto vs, to be diligently considered. Behold (saith he) the mercie, &amp; wrath of God:
                        
                           The seueritie &amp; bountie of God.
                         
                        wrath, towardes them that fell: but towards thee that doest persist in faith, mercy. &amp;c. And thus doeth the Apostle right well aduertise vs: but that we for our part may bee able to comprehend them both, the especial assistance of God had need to enlighten our vnderstanding: for there are no finall nomber of people, whose senses, either through ignorance, or els through negligence, are dazeled and darkened in the right comprehending therof. Amongst the which ignorant sort of people, first may the Iewes be rightly placed, who being deluded with a preposterous opinion of sinister iudgement,
                           The preposterous opinion of many touching the seueritie and bountie of God.
                         do interprete this bountie of God to be there, from whence they ought haue feared his terrible indignatiō. Secondly, amongst the negligent nomber may be rekoned the Gentiles, of whom many are ouer slowe, and sluggish to enter into due consideration of Gods goodnes, but quicksighted enough, to pearce into his wrathful seueritie. Of those two sortes of people, I do purpose by Gods assistance to discourse somewhat, so farre as ye time wil permit, to the end I may



profit them both, if it bee possible, or at least offer inconuenience to neither of them, as I trust.
                     And first, I can neuer woonder sufficiently enough at the Iewes, for that many yeres and ages enduring yt sharpe &amp; seuere scourge of Gods dreadfull displeasure, they could notwithstanding haue neuer any feeling of their owne calamitie, nor perseuerance of the heauie clogge of Gods grieuous vengeance, ne yet any affection to be disbourdened of their infidelitie, sweetely beguiling them selues, with a glauering shew of a false shadow, flattering them selues likewise, with a fantasticall hope of a terrene kingdome, whereof they had neuer any one word promised by God, and awayting for the comming of such a Messhias, whom neuer any of ye Prophets knew. Finally so farre forth preuailed the deceite of this error to confound the sensible part of their vnderstanding minde, that being otherwise a people most abhorred of God, &amp; men, they would neuerthelesse most arrogantly vaunt them selues to bee more esteemed, and more precious in the sight of God, then all other nations, people and tongues: and that they were his only darlings, and



therefore could not by any meanes be defrauded of the power of his promise, nor be sequestred from the true Oliue tree, whereof they were the naturall branches, wallowing continually in a most filthy puddle of pestilent error, not much vnlike to the Romish Synagogue in this our age, whose senses seeme to be tippled with the same dolldreanche: which kinde of people being of all other nations most needie of the mercy of God, it is a wonder notwithstanding, to see how trimly they play wylye beguilie with themselues in the dispensation of pardons, whereof they falsely chalenge to themselues chief stewardship vnder the title of the Church, and inheritable succession of Peters chayre,

(say they) promised, that he wil neuer forsake his Church? what then? Haue not the keyes lyneally descended vnto vs from blessed S. Peter, euer hitherto, being the chiefe head of the Apostles, which the Lord hath promised shal neuer be taken away? Is there any more yet? what? is it possible for Gods trueth it selfe to defraude the credite of his couenant, whereunto he hath bound him selfe with a most sacred othe?
                     Uery well now. And whereupon doth the blinde arrogancie of the Iewish Nation magnifie their race? do we not deriue our petigree (say they) lyneally from our most holy father Abraham? Are we not borne, and named Israelites, by the name of our great graundsier Israel, the Patriarch? did not the Lord credite vs only with the safe custodie of the Arke of his couenant? Haue not we a promise from God by the mouth of his Prophets, of a Messhias and Sauiour to come? Hath not god prepared an euerlasting throne for the kingdom of our Messhias? Is not he of power to make his couenant inuiolable, that with so many othes hath ratified ye same? Nor will hee not perfourme the othes which he hath made? Surely I wil not much gainsay,



that it is in deede no final matter, wherof eche partie debateth so largely of the promises of almightie God. Yet all this notwithstanding, all things depend not so alwayes vpon Gods promises made, but due consideration ought also be had of the minde and intent of him that maketh the promise in the scriptures: and the same well weighed and compared with the due circumstances and other places of the scripture, if we will be accompted true and syncere interpretoures of Gods holy scriptures: that is to say, It behoueth vs duely and orderly to define and dispose all and euery thing apart by it selfe, not those thinges onely which are promised, but must withall respect the persons, the place, the cause and consideration, and al other circumstances of the promises. And therefore albeit we do graunt vnto them that all those promises are true, whereupon they bragge so much, touching the succession of the Patriarches and Apostles, yet shall they neuer be able to winne this at our handes, To wit, that this ordinarie discent according to the lawe of the flesh, is a sufficient fundation to buyld the Church of God vpon.

                     As concerning the promises of God therfore, this is vndoubtedly to be holden, that the promises be in their owne nature simply true: yet in such wise true notwithstanding, as God hath not alwayes chained them to time, place or persons of men: which albeit were



tyed fast to place and persons, yet are the proude and high mynded shaken of, the promises remayning still in their force. Euen so the Iewes, although they prescribe vpon a promised place in Sion, Psalme 132: Here will I buylde my Tabernacle, because I haue chosen it.
                        
                           Esay .31.
                         Againe in the Prophet Esay. This is my fornace, this is my fire. &amp;c. And although they haue also a promise of the persons, when as the blessing is promised to Abraham, and to his seede for euer, yet this withstandeth nothing at all, but that rebelles are punished by God, the Temple consumed by fire, the altar throwen downe, and the citie put to the sacke and destroyed. And yet the meane whiles almightie God cōtinueth st
                           •
                        dfast in his promise neuerthelesse, but by a far other meane, then mans capacitie is able to conceiue. Whereupon that holy and melodious Psalmist, not without great reason, doeth crye out in a certaine place of his mysticall Sonets in this wise:
                           Psal. 117
                         
                        And it is marueilous in our eyes. Euen so do I iudge conuenient to esteeme of the counterfaite succession of the Apostolique and Romish See, which if our prelates enforce so narrowly to be straighted to the limits of place &amp; persons,



they must needes bewray their double errour therein, being not only absurdely iniurious to holy scriptures, but fōdly careles in breaking ye rules of Logick. For in their arguing, they do cōmonly thrust more into the conclusion, then in their former propositions. As if a man would frame an argument after this maner: The perpetuitie of the promised succession is graunted to Peter and his successours. The Romish Prelats do succede in Peters chaire or place. Ergo: The Romish Prelates are ye onely successours of Peter: the only vniuersall Bishops: the only Princes of ye Church: whose faith can neuer faint.
                     But we haue sufficiently enough discouered the maskings &amp; iuglings of this Romish counterfaite els where. And therefore lest we roaue too much abroad from the marke,

                         and wander from the Oliues (as ye prouerbe saith) we wil returne againe to Pauls Oliue tree, &amp; the braunches of the same: whereupon wee promised before to discourse. Of the which braunches, how some were broken of, and some others engrafted againe into the true Oliue tree, we haue alreadie opened somewhat vnto you out of the Apostle. And not onely out of the Apostle this is opened,



but the same was also set downe at large long time before the Apostle, by the prophet Esay: out of which place of Esay, it seemeth that the Apostle tooke occasion of all this discourse. Let vs Gentiles therefore marke wel what Esay doth prophecie of the Iewes. Let the Iewes also attend to the preaching of their owne Prophete, who agreeth herein altogether with our Apostle touching the Iewes.
                           Esay. cap. 10.

And there shall aryse an yssue out of the roote of lesse. &amp;c. And lest the Iewes may cauill, that these speaches do nothing concerne them, let them harken agayne to the same Prophet, not only prophecying of them, but also poynting vnto the Iewes with the finger as it were the 17 chapter:

Neyther yet cease you to runne onwarde, styll gaping after, I know not after what Messhias to come. What?

But let vs see by what reason, with what conscience you are enduced heerevnto. If you iudge this a matter of so great importaunce, that ye can rehearse in a long

And can not Ismael, Esau, Saul, can not Dathan and Abyron, and all that other rascall rabble of Hebrews, who made insurrection agaynst Moses: finally, can not many wicked kinges amongst you, false prophets, horrible church robbers, &amp; Idolaters euen amiddes amongst you, vaunte vpon the selfe same race and parentage, whereupon you braue your selues so gloriously? Whereupon appeareth playnly, that this outwarde discent of blood, and fleshly progenie, doth not auayle so much for your challenge: but that there is some other thing that maketh a kindly generation, and



the true ofspring of Abraham, in the sight of God. Moreouer if it may be lawfull to glory in the auncient stocke, what may be thought of Christ him selfe, whom we do worshippe? in whome if ye require who was his father, he came not in deed from man, but discended from God. But if you demaunde of his mother: he is on the mothers side a Iewe borne, according to the flesh, the sonne of Abraham, an yssue of the same seed that you are, whose children you challenge your selfe to be according to the fleshe. And wherefore then do you so cruelly detest him? Why do your brethren so hatefully enuie and maligne your naturall brother? And beeyng Iewes borne your selues, why do you so vylanously persecute your naturall kinseman, beyng likewise a Iewe borne, and why haue you slayne him so cruelly?
                     And what hath he committed at any time,

                         worthy of this so monstruous rancor &amp; cankered despite? Was it because he did professe him selfe to be the Sonne of God? Albeit he did neuer speake any thing in his owne commendation without singular modestie, neyther boasted in his speach further of him self, then that he was the sonne of man: yet if this

If as yet ye do not acknowledge him, declare the cause then that breedeth this misliking in you, and troubleth your consciences. Is it because he liued in poore &amp; beggarly estate amongst the impouerished, &amp; them yt were worth nothing? But your prophet Zacharie lōg before he was reuealed, reported that he should be euē such a one:
                           Zach. 9.

And it behoued truely, that he which should come to ouerthrow ye high minded &amp; riche of this world, &amp; to enrich ye poore, should be him selfe embased &amp; poore.
                     What els then? is it because he was seene to walke in base and simple apparell, and was despised amongst you? Euen such a one doth the prophete Esay paynte out vnto vs in his 53. chapter:

Surely he hath borne our infirmities, &amp; carried our sorowes, he was taken out of prison, &amp; from Iudgemēt, &amp; who shal declare his age? by the knowledge of him selfe, my seruaunt shall iustifie many: for he shall beare their iniquities. The will of the Lorde shall prosper in his hands, and he shal deuide the spoyle with the strong. The kings shal shut their mouthes at him. You haue nowe therfore heard, how he shoulde be poore and deformed, according to the outwarde shewe of the fleshe, euen such a one as our Gospel hath described him. And briefely to be playne, if he had not thus bene poore, &amp; reiected from amongst you, he could not haue bene the ryght Messhias in deede. Uerily such a one he seemed to you once, whē it was, according to the outward countenāce of the flesh, before he had obteined the power of the kingdome vpon the crosse: But hauing then forthwith receiued y• throne of his kingdome, in what triūphant maiestie he sitteth &amp; reigneth now in heauen, let ye mystical Psalmist Dauid make report, who in spirite foresaw him, sitting at the right hād of the Lord. Let their witnes be heard also, who were beholders



of the whole action of his ascēsion, &amp; with their bodily eyes sawe the same whome Dauid beheld in spirit, euen with their carnal eyes I say gazing vpon him, whiles yet hee was lifted vp in their sight into heauen, and did perfectly discerne him also sitting at the right hand of the maiestie. Let them also record the same, whose inward feeling &amp; minds of the soule he doeth inlighten with heauenly effectual operation, and vouchsafeth daily to enterparten him selfe vnto. And I would to God it might please the same to open your eyes also, that once at the length you might throughly enioye the inestimable glory, and vnspeakeable maiestie of his euerlasting kingdome. In the meane space, ye may easily conceiue a taste and feeling as it were of the trueth, by groping the shadowes and prefigured tokens of the scriptures, except ye had rather wilfully and wittingly shut fast your eyes from so manifest demonstration of infallible certainetie.
                     First, what one thing was of more royaltie, then the kingdome of Dauid? And yet what one thing was more entangled and streighted, whiles as yet like a seely moath he kept his fathers sheepe? whiles he was tossed



in turmoyle with most cruel persecution? At what time Ioseph being circumuented by the iniurie of his brethren, became carraine leane in a lothesome dungeon: when as Abraham was commanded to abandone his natiue countrey, and to become a banished outcast from his kindred and his fathers house: whiles Iacob was constrayned to redouble his seruice vnder his v

                        ckle Laban: what time Moyses was by Gods calling translated from an exiled outlawe to be a guide and leader of y• Israelites: from how great basenes and miserie were all these aduaunced to wonderfull estimation and dignitie? And what was the meaning of the holy ghost els, then vnder the shadowes and figures of those persons, to represent vnto vs ye very patterne and image of the sonne of God? And yet if you duely consider the estate of Christes outward basenes, what wanted he at any time, to the necessary furniture of his liuelihode, notwithstanding this shew of extreme penurie? Nay what want at all could molest him, who with a very fewe crustes could feede so great a crewe of thousandes in so deserte a wildernes? Or how could he be termed poore, at whose becke and word of mouth, heauen and



earth did obey, the seas and windes, life and death, finally all the degrees of creation were subiect vnto?
                     But that writing and title called by the name of a Nazarite doth encumber you perhaps:
                           Iesus Nazare

                              us.
                         because it behoued that Messhias should be borne in Bethleem the citie of Dauid. If he were not borne in Bethleem, I report me to the Chronicles &amp; Records of the time of his birth, and the circumstances thereof. Let the testimonies of the angels, shepheards, wise men, his owne mother, Ioseph, and all the Euangelistes bee examined. Moreouer, what emported that horrible slaughter of all the suckling Babes of Bethleem, only by the cruel proclamation of Herode, without any molestation of the infants of Nazareth: vnlesse Herode the king had bene throughly perswaded, that aboue that instant of tyme, wherein Christ was borne, the same verie king of the Iewes was then borne in the citie of Bethleem? What els is it then that troubleth you? because he dyed the death?
                           The death of Christ.
                         What do I heare? what? Haue you alwayes awaited for a Messhias that coulde not bee bereft of life? How then should this Messhias deliuer Iacob his people from their iniquities,



when as no remission of sinnes coulde bee without slaughter &amp; blood, according to the infallible testimonies, and continual sacrifices of your owne lawe? Briefely, if it were not requisite that Messhias shoulde dye the death, then did all the Prophets lye, Zachary, Daniel, Dauid, Esay, did lye: which haue not only made mencion of his death, but haue most learnedly also set downe the cause of his death. For this we reade in Daniel,
                           Daniel. ca. 9.
                         
                        That wickednes (saith he) may finish, and sinnes be sealed vp, iniquitie reconciled, and euerlasting righteousnes may be brought in. And proceeding a litle further in the same Chapter, doth expressely declare that Christ ought to be slaine. In like maner the Prophet Esay:
                           Esay. ca. 53.
                         
                        If he shall make his soule an offring for sinne, sayth he. The very same thing doeth Moyses also prefigure vnto vs vnder certaine ceremonies of sacrifices, types and figures not altogether obscure. What say you to Esaye the Prophet: who doeth not only discouer the cause, but the maner also of his death, his spittings, scourging, wounds, plagues, buffetings and reproches? What say you to Zacharie, who mencioneth the pearcing of his side with a speare? What say you to Dauid,



who describeth the nayling of his hands and feete, the sponge full of vineger, the rending his flesh from the bones, the casting lots for his garment? What say you to Moyses also, who vnder ye title of the Brasen serpent, doth prognosticate his lifting vp on the Crosse?
                     But here againe some froward person amongst you will murmure againe in this wise.
                           The Iewes obiection answered.
                         In what sort can Christ be said in the scriptures to be euerlasting, if he must of necessitie be slaine? This scrupule no man can more effectually vnloose, then the Prophet Dauid in his mysticall Psalme:
                           Psal. 1
                                 •
                              .
                         
                        Thou shalt not leaue my soule (saith he) in the graue, nor suffer thy holy one to see corruption. Where you heare his soule layed in the graue, you must vnderstand that to be spokē of his death and buriall. Againe, when you heare, that he is risen againe from his sepulchre, you must interprete the same of his infinite eternitie, &amp; vnperishable freedome, exempt from all maner of corruption. Whereby appeareth notably discerneable vnto you, eche condicion in one selfe person: That is to say: That he is both a mortall man, and an eternall God. In the one wherof the infirmitie of his manhode is palpable: in the other the glory of his resurrection



is most euidētly prouable. What? And do ye expect yet an other euerlasting Messhias besides this?
                           Messias whē he commeth must not bee receiued of the Iewes.
                         What a phantasie is this? As though when the true Messhias is come, he may obtaine any courteous entertainement amongst you? Truely none at all

Prophets, you wil neuer dutifully allowe of the cōming of the true Messhias, but that ye wil continually remaine in an vncertaine expectation of some other. For if he be accepted by the general consent of you al wtout exceptiō, surely he can not possibly be ye true Messhias. Againe, if he be refused from amongst you, how long wil you hang in suspense of his comming?

                         in the Paschall Lambe, in the brasen Serpent, in the Rocke, in Manna, in the feast of Pentecoste: briefely whatsoeuer exercises were practized in shadowes, types &amp; figures, we do vnfainedly acknowledge to haue met, cōcurred, &amp; byn accōplished in one body. And this body truely is Christ Iesu, who is also ye ende &amp; consummation of al the whole Lawe. In like maner the sacrifices and ceremonies, trimminges and deckings of the olde Law, conteined in them selues no sounde nor permanent matter, but were shadowes and forerunners of more excellent graces. For what is he so poreblinde in this our age, that knoweth not, that God doth not dwel in Temples made by mens handes? that consciences are not cleāsed from sinnes with the blood of goats &amp; of bulles? But these bloody offrings obteined a certaine resemblance only of the true purging of sinnes. What doth the commandement of the prophete emply, when in your Passeouer he charged a lambe of a yere olde, cleane &amp; vndefiled to be slayne by families &amp; tribes? Can your senses be so blockishe to thinke, that so great &amp; effectuall operation lurketh in the blood of beasts, as may auayle



to deliuer you from cruel thraldome, &amp; translate you to the lande of promise flowing with milke &amp; hony, if there were no cornell of deeper mysterie enclosed within the outwarde shell of the letter?
                     It remayneth nowe,
                           The promises cōteyned in the Prophets.
                         that we treate of the promises of the Prophetes, whereupon you boaste so much, and rayse all your building, which onely thing of all others, doeth vnioynte and shyuer in pieces all the strong bulwarkes of your vnbeliefe, euen to the very bottome of the foundation. And to the ende I may make this appeare more euidently, I wyll combate a crashe with you in your owne castle, whereunto I will vse none other furniture, but your owne weapons, I meane the very words and knowen sentences of your owne prophets. And I wil so deale with you in this cōflict by the ayde &amp; assistāce of God, as not heaping together out of all the Prophets in generall their whole armorie of proofe that I know, for that were vnmeasurable. But I wil chuse rather out of certaine of thē, not a multitude, to surcharge you wt nomber, but certaine especial testimonies, wt the which as wt choise shot &amp; powder, I wil so batter y• bulwarks of your blūdered



vnbeliefe, that you shall not be able by any meanes possible to delude the matter with caffling, nor escape by denyall, nor with any subtile legerdemayne of litterall exposition, cast a myste before mine eyes, nor vntwyne your selues out of the meashe by any crooked conueyaunce, as you are wont to do, though ye would neuer so fayne, but either you shall be peruinced willingly to come to reason, or els against your willes to be confoūded altogether with the manifest light of the trueth.
                     And to beginne first with the prophete Esay, what answere can all the ofspring of the Hebrewes make to these woordes written in the ninth chapter of his prophecie?

                        ̄ceth a wōderfull triumphaunt victorie to all them that walke in the night of darkenesse, and in the shadowe of death, prophecying likewise, that it will come to passe, that the chaynes of cruell captiuitie beyng crackt asunder, &amp; yoke of seruile bondage being crusht in pieces, they shall once at the length enioye most happie



calme of gladsome freedome. Well then. To whom was this promise made? to the Iewes alone? is he not also the God of the Gentils? Then by what meanes shall this victorie be obtained? by any forreine power, or warlike broile? No. The Prophete doth vtterly deny that, pronouncing these wordes foorthwith: Because euery spoyle (sayth he) of the warryour that is with noyse, and with tumbling of garmentes in blood, shall be abolished with burning and consuming fire, euen as in the victorie that Gedeon obteyned agaynst the Madianites, the conquest was atchieued by the onely hande of God, and the presence of Gedeon, mans force &amp; power litle auayling thereunto. In like maner the prophet by like comparison perswadeth vs to beleeue, that this victorie and freedome must be purchased by the onely blessing of God, and not by any force or policie of man: and that this blessing of God is sufficiently effectual of it selfe, without all force of bloody battel, to establish assured and v
                           •
                        doubted peace and euerlasting freedome to all creatures. Go ye to nowe, let me this demaunde of you, when, and from whence this so great blessednes shal happen? The Prophet him selfe maketh answere, By



the byrth of a childe (sayth he) and by gyuing a sonne vnto vs. For vnto vs a childe is borne (sayth he) &amp; vnto vs a sonne is giuen, &amp; the Iudgement is vpon his shoulders. &amp;c. Such is the excellent dignitie of the sonne, so great is the maiestie of his nature, proceeding from so notable a father, that he needeth none other ayde in the worlde, to the attainement of absolute perfection of most blessed felicitie. For what can be of more excellent effectuall operation to the through cleansing awaye of all filthie contagion of corrupt nature, or more presently auaylable to remoue all matter of brabble and contention, then to receyue the very sonne of God him selfe into the felowshippe of this our mortall nature, beeyng a Prince of so great and superexcellent Maiestie,

                         as that he may not seeme to be borne an inheritour of a kingdome, to rule as a king, but that the kingdome may seeme rather to spryng vp and be erected together with his byrth? For so he sayeth, The gouernment is layd vpon his shoulders, not purchased by any his industrie or trauayle, but layde vpon his backe, euen from his first entry into this worlde, and growyng vp together with him, euen from his very

And nowe if you be desirous to knowe the name of this famous Prince, the Prophete him selfe will forthwith declare vnto you:
                           A childe is borne vnto vs. &amp;c. Esay .

                        His name (sayth he) shalbe called Wonderfull, a Counseller, The mightie God, The euerlasting Father, The Prince of peace, The increase of his gouernment and peace shall haue none ende. &amp;c. Where you see mention made of the kingdome of peace and patience, you may easily discerne, not a kingdome onely, but a distincte maner of kingly preeminence, far vnlike to an earthly or worldly gouernment. Nowe hearken where the place and nation is, ouer which this King must exercise his dominion. Hee shall sitte vpon the Throne of Dauid, and vpon his kingdome, to order and establyshe it with Iudgement and with Iustice. Behold here vnder these Tytles, Iudgement and Iustice, is excluded all blooddye tyrannie.

                     Was euer man so froward of iudgement, as to wreste and racke this place of the Prophet, of releasing the yoke of the burdens, of breaking the rodde of the oppressour, to any other purpose appliable (though he endeuor to the contrary neuer so much) then to the very comming of Christ Iesu the sonne of God, in whome we do beleeue, who was sent of God the father, &amp; giuē vnto vs for an euerlasting king? For where is it possible to find a king yssuing from out so notable a parentage, and of such an vndefiled life, who by dying the death could crush in pieces the tyrannie of death, and after he had tasted the death coulde of his owne power reuiue, and rayse him selfe vp, to the glorious maiestie of euerlasting kingdome, this one Meschias onely except, before whom all nations of ye earth do &amp; shal bowe the knee?

He woulde in deede haue charged the shoulders of the Iewes with this yoke of burden &amp; rod of oppressour, but he neuer pinched thē so much therewith. Will they interprete the same of the captiuitie of Babylon? Neyther will this hang together by any meanes. For albeit it pleased that mighty king of Babylon Cyrus of his bountiful mercy, to graunt free passage to ye Israelites, to returne into their owne countrey: yet was not he able to vnloose this propheticall yoke, and establishe a peace that coulde neuer be dissolued, for that he was not onely a meere straunger, but also voyde of all colour to clayme the throne of his father Dauid, by any maner of descent from him.

                        which shall proclayme peace, not warre, to the Gentiles? Where is that Prince, whose voyce shall not he heard to make any noyse in the streetes? Where is he, that shall not bruyse the broken rod? and shall conuert the weapōs of steele into ashes? On ye other side: if ye awayte for a peaceable king, such a one, as the Prophetes do describe, what conquest then shall there be of Gentiles and nations? Ponder these things in your minds wel, and aduisedly, &amp; see how these matters being contrary and repugnant eche to other, they may be framed to agree together.

What can be more cleare thē the brightnes of this prophecie? what sentence more manifest? what more fruitful consolation? Wherein as many thinges seeme worthy to be remembred, so three things chiefely are to

most delicate voyce ful of all spiritual cōfort, which the Lord him selfe pronoūceth here by the mouth of his prophet, speaking cōfortably to Ierusalem,

In your miserable &amp; cōtinual calamitie, in your manifold bondage &amp; captiuitie yt you haue endured first vnder ye Egyptians, then vnder the Assyrians, next vnder the Syrians, &amp; lastly vnder king Herode the stranger, you haue hitherto felt ye smart of Gods iustice. But now it hath pleased ye Lorde to alter his determinatiō cō

into direfull captiuitie, any dreadfull punishment of your haynous impietie. For the time shall come, when the Lorde wyll no more rewarde your iniquities with horrible scourges and plagues, but of his inestimable clemencie shall couche you within the blessed bowels of his bottomlesse mercy. And if you be desirous to knowe the time wherein these glad tidings shalbe performed amongst you, take this for a signe and token, wherby you may discerne the time, whereof I doe foretel you.

Euery valley shall be exalted, &amp; euery mountaine and hill shalbe made lowe. &amp;c. And the voyce proceeding yet forwarde, and demaunding what he should cry: Saye vnto the cities of Iudah (sayth he) Behold your God, behold the Lord God wil come with power, and his arme shall rule for him, and his rewarde is with him. &amp;c. Whē the sound of this trumpe out of the huge desert wildernes shal pearce into your eares and be seene with your eyes, this shalbe a signe for you to knowe, that he is not farre from the gates, that shall redeeme you from your captiuitie.
                     
                        I haue disclosed vnto you the meaning &amp; sense of the Prophet, if I bee not deceiued: wherein two especiall notes are to be considered: namely the punishment of sinne, and the voyce of a cryer in the wildernes. Both which notes, who doeth not easily perceiue to haue bene accomplished in the persons of Christ Iesu, &amp; of Iohn Baptist? yea, and so accomplished in them, as no gappe nor starting hole may possibly be found for you to escape, but that this place must be of necessitie applied to Christ our anoynted king and Sauiour. For what els imported the voyce of Iohn Baptist crying in the wildernes, but to prepare a waye ready for the comming of the Lord? And what els hath the whole doctrine of the new Testament taught and dayly doth teache vs also, but an euerlasting forgiuenes of sinnes, in the maner of a continuall vacation from the terme of the lawe? for as long as the law and Gods iustice did combate against sinnes, the warfare could neuer be broken vp:
                           The warre betweene Gods iustice, and y• sinnes of man.
                         but the enemie being once subdued, and the dominion of the law brought into captiuitie, our warfare must needes be at an end. For assone as the sinner beginneth to be no lōger vnder the Law, but vnder grace, nor findeth



any aduersary to wtstand him, but hath caught the victorie into his owne hands once,
                           The ende of our warfare by the Prophete, Esai. cap. 40.
                         what remayneth but he may ioyously triumph and keepe holy day, being now deliuered from all feare of further controlment.
                     
                        
                           Iere. 23.
                        Next vnto Esay let vs annexe the testimonie of Ieremie, who after he had prophesied much of the returne of the Iewes from the captiuitie of Babylon, doeth encourage them againe at the last with this kinde of consolation: that from thenceforth they should neuer be caryed from their owne countrey into bondage againe, speaking thus in the xxiii. chapter of his prophesie. And I will gather the remnant of my sheepe out of all countreys, whither I shall driue them, and will bring them againe to their foldes, and they shall growe and encrease: And I will rayse vp shepheards ouer them which shal feed them: And they shall dread no more to be afraide: nor shall any of them be lacking saieth the Lord.
                        
                           Iere. 23.
                         And immediatly after: Behold the dais come, saith the Lord, that I will raise vnto Dauid a righteous branche, and a king shall reigne and prosper, and shall execute iudgement and iustice in the earth. In his dayes Iudah shalbe saued, and Israel shall dwell in



safetie. And this is the name whereby they shal cal him, The Lord our righteousnes. &amp;c. And againe in the xxiiii. of his prophesie:
                           Iere. 24.
                         
                        Like as these good figges, so will I knowe them that are caryed away captiue out of 
                              •
                           udah to be good, whom I haue sent out of this place into the lande of the Chaldeans: for I will set mine eyes vpon them for good, and I wil bring them againe into this lande, and I will buylde them and not destroye them, and I will plant them, and not roote them out. &amp;c. And againe in the xxxi. Chapter:
                           Cap. 31.
                         
                        Behold, I will bring them from the North countrey, and gather them from the coastes of the worlde, with the blynde and the lame amongst them, with the woman with child, and her that is deliuered also: A great companie shall returne hither. And they shall come and reioyce in the height of Sion, and their soule shall be as a watered Garden, and they shall hunger no more: for I will forgiue their iniquities, and will remember their sinnes no more. And the seede of Israel shall not cease for not beeing a nation before me for euer. And the places shalbe buylt, &amp; shalbe al holy vnto the Lord, neither shall they be pluckt vp nor destroyed



any more for euer. And againe in his xxxii. Chapter,
                           Cap. 32.
                         
                        Thus hath the Lord God of Israel spoken concerning the citie, whereof you say, it shall be deliuered into the hand of the king of Babel by the sword, by famine, &amp; by pestilence, Beholde, I wil gather them out of all countreys, wherein I haue scattered them in mine anger, and will bring them againe into this place, and will cause them to dwel in safetie. And they shalbe my people, and I wil be their God. And I will giue them one heart and one way, that they may feare mee for euer.
                        
                           Cap 33.
                         And proceeding forward in ye chapter ensuing, Because the people of Ierusalem did not submit them selues vnto the Chaldees, but resisted them with force, therefore were their bulwarkes filled with dead bodies, But beholde, I wil giue it health and amendement, and I will cure them, and wil reueile vnto them aboundance of peace and trueth. And ther shalbe heard in this place of which you say that it shalbe desolate, euen in the streetes of Ierusalem that are desolate, and without any inhabitant, there shalbe the voyce of ioye and gladnes. Behold, the daies come, saieth the Lorde, that I will perfourme that good thing, which I haue promised



vnto the house of Israel, and to the house of Iudah. In those dayes I wil cause the branch of righteousnes to grow vp vnto Dauid, and he shal execute iudgement and righteousnes in the lande. In those dayes shal Iudah be saued, and Israel shall dwell in safetie. And this shall they call her, The Lord is our righteousnes: For thus saith the Lord, Dauid shall neuer want a man to sit vpon the throne of the house of Israel. Neither shall the Priests and Leuites want a man before me to offer burnt offrings, &amp; to do sacrifice continually. And afterwards againe in the l. chapter:
                           Cap. 50
                         
                        Thus saith the God of Israel, Behold, I wil visite the king of Babel &amp; his lād, as I haue visited the king of Assur. And I wil bring Israel againe to his habitation, he shall be fed, and his soule shalbe satisfied in his due time, saith the Lord. In those dayes shal the iniquitie of Israel be sought for, and there shalbe none: and the sinnes of Iudah, and they shal not be found: for I wil be merciful vnto them whom I do reserue. &amp;c.
                     
                     Hereunto may be added the like testimonie of Baruch in his v. chapter:

                           The meaning of the prophets speaking of the kingdom of Dauid, must ne
                                 •
                              des be spiritually vnderstood.
                        What can be of more efficacie, then the testimonies of the foresaid scriptures? in the which forasmuch as two things are set down chiefely to be noted, ye must yeeld to the one of them of very necessitie: either that this kingdome of Israel shal neuer decay againe, after their returne from ye Babylonical captiuitie: which being construed after the carnal sense of the letter, is most false, as you maye plainely perceiue: or els, if the kingdome of Israel be ouerthrowen and haue an end, and so thē the Prophets to lye: which is the most absurde thing that may be spoken.
                     Whereby appeareth most euidently, that all those sayings wherein the Prophets haue foretolde of the royaltie of Dauids throne, and of the euerlasting glory therof, must haue a certaine mysticall and spirituall interpretation. For you are not ignorant your selues



of that which happened to that fleshly and worldly estate of this kingdom, and into how narowe streightes &amp; extremities it was forced, when as your citie was besieged and razed by ye Romanes, your Temple consumed with fire, and all things in the citie deuoured, and ransacked, euen to the rooting out of all your nation almost: So that the circumstances of the times, being duly weighed, wil plainely conuince you, that these promises made touching the perpetuall establishment of the kingdome of Dauid, must be farre otherwise vnderstoode, and that your selues either lye shamefully in the order of your exposition, or els that your owne Prophets did prophesie contrary to ye trueth.
                           Dilemma.
                         Sith therfore one of these two must of necessitie be graunted, chuse which you wil, or els discouer some way how you may escape out of this Labyrinth. First I suppose no man wil cōdemne ye Prophets for liers, for thei deliuered nothing vnto vs, but yt which by wonderful inspiratiō they receiued of ye holy ghost, yea, ye same also infallibly true, as approued frō time to time by the circumstances, and sequele of the time.
                     For they foresawe (as trueth was) being infourmed by the holy ghost, first, ye deliuery



of the remnant of that nation in the transmigration of Babylon: and it came to passe: they foresawe also, that this captiuitie should endure no lesse thē lxx yeres. This also came to passe. Finally, they foresawe that after the full expiration of this exile and banishment, a prince should come, and a sonne should be giuen in the fulnes of time, which should possesse the throne of his father Dauid, and take vpon him the gouernement of the kingdome, and should establishe the same in a permanent and vnperishable course of continuance, peace and tranquillitie for euer. And this also was perfourmed euen then accordingly, when as the sonne of God was borne in the citie of Dauid:
                           Esay .9.
                         that woonderful counsailour, the mightie God, the prince of peace: who albeit died once according to the flesh, &amp; seemed to be vanquished, yet was he not holden of death aboue three dayes, but suruiued of his owne power, and liueth for euer and euer: and in dying hath obteyned an 
                           •
                        ndlesse conquest of death,
                           Iudg. 16.
                         and triumpheth now (not much vnlike vnto Sampson) victoriously ouer death, hath rent in sunder the yron gates of sinne, hath crusht the tyranny of the deuil in pieces, and purchased euerlasting life for



his elect, not perishable by any assault of hautie aduersary, nor vanquishable by any power of worldly policie. For as to that,
                           After the captiuitie of Babylon god promiseth perpetuall continuance vnto the Iewes.
                         that the citie was put to the sacke by the puissant armie of the Romanes, the Temple burnt and razed to the ground, all this nothing at al diminisheth the credit of the Prophet touching the establishment of the glory of that throne, but rather confirmeth, and doeth argue it to be of much more estimation. The rebel Iewes, and trayterous murtherers of Christ were ouercome in battel: but Christ him self Prince of that kingdome with his Church could not be brought vnder subiectiō, neither shall at any time, but hath conquered, liueth, and triumpheth dayly. And although you can not yet conceiue this inuincible Maiestie of that euerlasting king, yet your Prophets saw it, yea, your father Abraham sawe it, and reioyced: Esay sawe it, witnessing the same with an othe:
                           Esay .62.
                         
                        The Lord hath sworne by his right hand, and by the strength of his arme. Surely I wil no more giue thy corne to bee meate for thine enemies, &amp; surely the sonnes of the strangers shall not drinke the wine for the which thou hast laboured: but they that haue gathered it shall eate thereof, and shall



praise the Lord. And the gatherers thereof shall drinke it in the courtes of my Sanctuarie. &amp;c.
                        
                           Esay .60.
                         Againe the same Esay speaking vnto Ierusalem as though she were prisoner in Babylon: Whereas thou hast bene forsaken, so that no man went by thee, I wil make thee an eternall glorie, and a ioye from generation to generation. &amp;c.
                        
                           Esay .54.
                         Moreouer in the 54. Chapter: For a moment in mine anger I hid my face from thee for a litle season, but with euerlasting mercie haue I had compassion vpon thee, saith the Lord thy redeemer: for this is vnto me as in the waters of Noah, to whome as I haue sworne, that I would no more go ouer the earth with waters, so haue I sworne, that I would no more bee angrie with thee nor rebuke thee. For the mountaines shall remoue, and the hilles shall fall downe, but my mercie shal not depart from thee, neither shall the couenant of my peace fal away, saieth the Lord, that hath compassion on thee.
                        
                           Esay .48.
                         And againe in another place. Go ye out of Babel, flee ye from the Chaldeans with a voyce of ioy, tel and declare this, shew it forth to the endes of the earth. Saye ye, the Lord hath redeemed his seruaunt Iacob. And within a litle after:
                           Esay .49.
                         
                        It is a small thing



that thou shouldest be my seruant to rayse vp the tribes of Iacob, and to restore the desol

                           tion of Israel. I will giue thee also for a light to the Gentiles, that thou maiest be my saluation vnto the end of the worlde. Beholde, I haue grauen thee vpon the palme of my hande: thy walles are euer in my sight. Thy buylders make haste, thy destroyers and they that made thee waste, are departed from thee. &amp;c.
                     
                     Neither did Esay see these things alone: The other Prophets, Patriarches, and holy ones also dyd awayte for the royall excellencie of this kingdome, before it was come. The Angels signified out of heauen that he was presently come, his miraculous works doe ratifie the same, his rysing againe at the feast of Easter confirmeth it, yea, the deuils them selues felt it, and dyd tremble for feare. The holie companie of Apostles, and Martyres doe confesse it: all tongues and Nations do speake of his glorie, bowe the knees, and worshippe him. Finally, the holie Ghost through woonderfull s

And I will rayse him vp at the last day. What can be of more power? For as the father hath life in him selfe, so likewise hath hee giuen to the sonne to haue life in him selfe, &amp; to giue life vnto him vnto whom he wil, and hath giuen him power also to execute iudgement. What can be more heauenly? Neither doeth the father iudge anie man, but hath giuen all the iudgement vnto the sonne. What can be more admirable?

What can be required more? Moreouer that ye may be assured that the sonne of man is of power to forgiue sinnes vpon earth, beholde a signe wrought vpon the sicke of the palsey: Take vp thy bed and walke. Againe: As the liuing father hath sent me, euen so do I send yo: whosoeuer sinnes ye forgiue, shalbe forgiuen them. Besides all this, let vs heare what Peter speaketh of him:

                         vnspeakeable power of her captaine Christ Iesu? But as the power of this captaine is spiritual, so it is not discernable, but by spiritual insight, raysed vp (as I sayd before) not to striue against mankinde, but to subdue the tyranny of Sathan,
                           The power of Christ is spirituall, set vp not agaīst man, but for man, to fight against ye spiritual operation of Satā.
                         the mighty prince of this world, and to despoyle &amp; force him out of his kingdome. And this may euery sensible man easily conceaue, if he will enter into somwhat a more deepe consideration of his miraculous workes: so that this marueilous victorie of this triumphaunt conquerour, can by no argument &amp; proofe appeare more manifestly, then euen in this one ouerthrow of that auncient archenemie. For if that conquest be so



much the more praise worthy, by howe much the force of the vāquished is more notorious, what ought we thē to iudge of him, who only and alone, vndertaking the challenge, not against mans power,
                           Christes victorie, not against man, but for man.
                         but in the behalfe and defence of mankinde rather, agaynst al those mightie &amp; inuisible aduersaries of mankind, vnuanquisheable otherwise by any policie of men, against all those spiritual furies &amp; incessaunt accusers of mankind before the throne of God, against al those princes &amp; potētates, and rulers of darkenes, against the poysoned dartes of death, agaynst the intolerable burden of sinne, agaynst the dreadfull curse of the Lawe, and wrath of Gods vengeaunce, agaynst the force and gates of hell, was able by his onely prowesse to treade downe, and triumphe ouer them all, without all ayde and helpe of man, yea and which is most to be marueiled at, without all strength, without al sleyght and policie of resistance, farre vnlike the warlike attemptes and martial affaires: where it commeth alwayes to passe, that the most notable and famous enterprises are neuer atchieued without huge troupes of couragious souldiers, or subtill practize of politique gouernours. For here beyond all reache



of mans vnderstanding, I know not how miraculously this marueilous victorie was obteyned, without force of armes, industrie and policie, through the onely plaine &amp; open conduct of simple trueth. For what simplicitie can be greater, then to yeeld to the wil of the aduersarie in humilitie and patience? And what could be more voyde of hope to recouerie?
                           The victorie of Christ by what meanes it was gottē.
                         And yet by this meanes it came to passe, that pompous Pride through humilitie was brought into subiection: glory of riches confounded by basenes of pouertie: hautie arrogancie of the worlde suppressed with humble infirmitie: the curse of the Law rased out by vndefiled innocencie: sinnes forgiuen: the mouth of the enemie stopped vp, through meeke taciturnitie: victorie obteined by yeelding: finally, death by dying vanquished, and life euerlasting purchased.
                     And yet to confesse the trueth frankly and simply, this glorious conquest wanted not his singular dexteritie and artificiall policie, beyng neuerthelesse both heauenly, holy and atchieued by most vpright Iustice: not to the ende to betraye in snare, or seduce any good man from the right path of trueth, but to intrappe that craftie enemie the Deuill onely.



And that not without great cause. For what coulde be more agreeable with reason,

                         then the same olde wylie serpent (which had beguiled mankind first with subtiltie and lyes) should be encountred againe with a certaine heauenly policie, (yet voyde of all colour of lying) and so entrapped and entangled with sleyghts &amp; deceites of his owne forge, should be catcht in his owne pytfall, and bereft of his place? What could be more conuenient, then to strangle the most horrible deceyuer with his owne halter, and by most iust lawe to disfraunchise the most vniust intruder from his vniust possession?

Thou didst vndermine the Sonne of God: wherein albeit thou didst scarse pynche him, yet hast thou slayne thy selfe thereby, &amp; blessed vs for euer. For thou hast not fastened him vpō the crosse alone, but nayled all our sinnes also together with him, which being now throughly cleāsed with that only sacrifice, hath deliuered vs from euerlasting tormentes, and recoyled them backe vpon thine owne head vnrecouerable for euermore.

                           Ezech. 28.
                         
                        And they shall dwell in their lād with all securitie, &amp; they shal buyld houses, &amp; shal plant vineyards, &amp; shall inhabit the land confidently, when I shal execute iudgement against all thē, that shal stand against them rounde about them. &amp;c. And againe in the 34. chapter thus he sayeth:
                           Cap. 34.
                         
                        And they shalbe safe in their lande, &amp; they shall no more be spoyled of the heathen, neither shall the beasts of the lande deuoure them, but they shall dwell confidently, and none shall make them afrayde. And I will rayse vp for them a plant of renowme. And they shall no more be consumed with hunger in



the land, neyther beare the reproche of the Heathen any more, &amp;c. And in his xxxvi. chapter, speaking to the mountaines of Israel:
                           Ezech. 36.
                         
                        And I wyll bryng my people agayne, (sayeth he) vnto them: and you shall bee theyr inheritaunce, and they shall possesse you. Thou shalt not waste thy people from hencefoorth. And I wyll cause no more to heare in thee the shame of the Heathen any waye: neyther shalt thou beare the reproche of the people any more. &amp;c. And immediately in the chapter next ensuyng:
                           Cap. 37.
                         
                        And they shall be no more two people, neyther be deuided any more from hencefoorth into kingdomes: neyther shall they be polluted any more with their Idolles, nor with any of their transgressions: But they shall dwell vpon their lande them selues, euen their sonnes, and their sonnes sonnes for euer. And my seruaunt Dauid shall be theyr Prince for euer. And I wyll make a couenaunt of peace with them, it shall be an euerlastyng couenaunt with them. And I wyll multyplye them, and wyll place my Sanctuarie among them for euermore. And in an other chapter a lyttle before:
                           Cap. 36.
                         
                        And I wyll call for corne, and



I will encrease it, and laye no famine vpon you. &amp;c. Nowe considering and conferring with this, the great famine that not long after ensued, the citie beeyng besieged by the Romanes, when as mothers were enforced through famine to slay their suckling babes, yea &amp; the citie besides were almost starued &amp; pyned vp with hunger, I can not see how that saying can be verified, vnlesse you vnderstand it, as hauing relation to the spirituall kingdome of Israel, and not to the carnall.
                     But to passe ouer these, because we shal not be able to stande vpon all their testimonyes spoken to this effect, (as I haue sayde before) we wyll proceede to others. And first let vs consider the place taken out of the ix. chapter of Daniel his prophecie, because it fitteth this purpose more notably, then any other: where the heauenly Prophete doeth in fewe woordes comprehende the whole estate of your common weale, from your returne out of the Babylonicall captiuitie, euen to the vttermost poynt of your desolation, describing withal in the same chapter, the death of the Messhias, the ende and consummation of sinne, together with the vtter abolishment of the obseruances and sacrifices of



the ceremonial Law, by such special markes &amp; tokēs so euidētly, that it can by no meanes possible be gainsayde. Wherefore let vs with good aduise ponder the words of the prophet, &amp; with no lesse diligēce, thē the matter requireth. For in this wise the Angel Gabriel doth cal vpon Daniel, whiles he was praying, and speaketh the wordes ensuing.
                     
                        At the beginning of thy supplications,
                        
                           Dan. 9.

And the streetes, and the wall (or trenches)



shalbe buylt againe in the streights of times. And after three score and two weekes shall Meschias be slayne, (annoynted) &amp; shal haue nothing, (shalbe bereft of his life.) And the people of the Prince that shall come, (comming) shall destroy the citie, and the Sanctuarie, and the ende thereof shalbe in (with) a flood: and to the end of the battel the desolation shalbe determined (the ende of desolations.)

And vpon the wyng (or as some saye for the ouerspreading) of the abominations, there shalbe desolation, (he shal make it desolate) euen vntil the consummation determined (determined desolation) shalbe powred vpon the desolate.

                        Veëin lo. And first herein the Iewes do agree together with vs, that these weekes are not to be nombred by limitation of dayes, but of yeres.
                     Wherefore these threescore two weekes spoken of by the Prophet are by computatiō accompted to amount to 436. yeres. After ye end of which threescore two weekes, Messhias shall establish his couenant by his doctrine, death, &amp; resurrection in the other weeke next ensuing. In the halfe whereof he shal by his owne only sacrifice and oblation, wherein he shal offer him selfe to God the father in his crosse and passion, dissolue and vtterly abolish all your sacrifices and offrings.
                     But here arise in the meane space manie scrupules to be resolued: first, to knowe at what time those weekes tooke their beginning, and so also when they ended. For herein the learned expositors seeme to be variable in iudgement. Some are of opinion that the beginning of the weekes entred first, whē as the seuentie yeres of their captiuitie were finished: That is to say, from the second yere of the reigne of Darius Histaspes. And of this minde are Clement of Alexandria,

                         grounding as it seemeth vpon the wordes of Zacharie in the first Chapter of his prophesie.
                     Againe many do denie this vtterly, supposing that the weekes beganne first at the going forth of the commaundement: That is to say, when proclamation was made by the commaundement of Cyrus in the first yere of his raigne, that the Iewes should be released, and sent home into their countrey againe. In like maner they do vary also, about the end and finishing of the said weekes. For some that reckone the beginning of ye weeks frō the first of Cyrus reigne, do ascribe ye end of the same to the time of Christes birth in the reigne of Augustus the Emperour of Rome. Some others do drawe them longer to the Baptisme and passion of Christ. Others also accompting frō Darius, do begin at the seconde yere of his raigne: many at the sixt, some others at the twentieth yere thereof. Some writers also mislyking the former opinions, doe make their reckoning otherwise. Besides this scrupule manie seeme to bee encumbred much about the intricate and confused supputation of the yeres



and reignes of the kings which succeeded Cyrus and continued vntill the comming of Alexander, which thing chiefely aboue all the rest entangleth the accompt most by reason of the vncertaine limitatiō of those times. There is also no lesse disagreement in the order and obseruatiō of the yeres, betwixt them which do nomber from the raigne of Cyrus: amongst whome those which applie to the byrth of Christ, do recompt the nomber of yeres to be 540: some reckone 501: some otherwise either more or lesse. Finally, albeit the most approued writers do verifie that foureteene Persian kings, or at the lest thirteene succeeded eche other in the kingdome of Persia vntil the conquest of Alexander, yet the Iewes make accompt of foure only. But these buzzards vnacquainted altogether with forreine gouernements, are to be reiected vtterly as vnmeete arbyters of this controuersie.
                     Some be of opinion, that Cyrus, after the conquest of Babylon reigned twentie yeres, some others seuen yeres only. Some report that betwixt Cyrus &amp; Darius the Assyrian, only Cambyses reigned, and that by the space of twentie yeres. There be others, that making



no mention of Cambyses at all, do enterlace betwixt Cyrus and Darius one named Assuerus, and vnto him they allowe twentie yeres of holding the kingdome likewise. So great is the varietie of opinion also concerning the continuance of the Persian Empire, yea euen amongst ye learned: whiles some do attribute to that gouernement vnder the Persiā Kings 130. yeres ful: others 200 lacking two: some other there bee which otherwise make their calculation.
                     But as concerning the succession of the Persian kings,
                           The varietie of writers in counting the weekes of Daniel.
                         many of our writers suppose that the Temple began to be builded at Ierusalem in the reigne of Longimanus, who as they say was ye fourth after Cyrus in success
                           •
                        on: which fourth place Ierome ascribeth to Darius, and driueth this Longimanus to be the seuēth in nomber after Cyrus. Briefly there is no one thing amōgst ye Historiographers, that moueth more doutful matter of controuersie, aswel among the Grecians as ye Latinists. Wherein as it would seeme troublesome to recite the names of al the authors that write of this matter: so would it be ouer tedious to recompt al their seueral opinions and reasons alledged thereunto. Neither wil



I take vpon me to determine any certaintie in this cōfuse varietie of wits, nor do I thinke it necessary: namely sithēce this our later age hath raised vp many learned men, who by exquisite comparing of ye auncient Chronicles, haue left to the posteritie commendable testimonie of their studious industrie: who albeit expresse no small disagreement in some certaine points, yet receiuing much light from the auncient Chronicles, seeme to approche somewhat neere the marke.

But Io. Caluine seemeth to allow neither of thē,

in ye reigne of Longimanus, nor y• end therof to be determined at the birth of Christ, as he supposeth: which thing truely is very wel noted by Io. Caluine, according to the singular dexteritie of his learning and capacitie.
                     For as it behoued these weekes to comprehend the fulnes of time, from the free manumission of the captiues, to ye last purging and clensing of sinnes, which should come to passe by the only oblation of Mes

                     Wel thē may some man say, what certainty can be agreed vpō in this so great cōtrarietie &amp; disagreement of opinions? For ye discharge of which subtil question, I do answere in few words. First the infallible testimonie of gods truth doth not depend vpon mans determination: howsoeuer men be caried hither &amp; thither in conceipt, &amp; their opinions like clockes whirled about vpō wheeles, that neuer sound in one minute of time, yet doeth not the daye alter his appointed course: no more will the certaintie of Gods promise be any time vnstedfast or deceiueable. And albeit auncient Chroniclers do somtimes wander in precise, and exact obseruation of minutes, and small moments of dayes, or yeres, or vtter their seuerall iudgements therein, according to their



seuerall capacities: yet this contrarietie withstandeth not so much, but there may be a generall consent in the substaunce of the matter debated: nor is this to be marueiled at, considering the great antiquitie of foreworne yeres, and the vnmeasurable blindnes, and ignorance in the same: so also how variable

true Messhias, euen the same Messhias, (I saye) which was borne of the virgine,

                     And thus much touching the diuersitie of iudgement in the computation of the learned: who notwithstandinge differ not so much in the state, and grounde of the question. Onely the controuersie aryseth vpon the application of the tyme: as whether the accompt of the weekes ought to bee referred to the birth of Christ, or to his passion. But what is this to the purpose: This groundwoorke remayneth yet vnshaken, and ratyfyed by most approued testimonie of generall consent, which apperteyneth chiefely to the sentence of the Prophet, and the materiall parte of his prophesie: to wit, that no one sentence throughout the whole Scriptures, doeth more manifestly conuince your errour touching your Messhias, and more substauncially establish our fayth, then this one testimonie of the Prophet Daniel, wherein the mysterie of



the seuentie weekes most manifestly is here determined vpon that nation, and people of yours. The which same weekes the Angel gathering again together, deuideth into three seuerall distinct orders. The first order comprehendeth seuen weekes: the second, three score two weekes: the third, one weeke only, which was the last, and the seuentieth in nomber. In which last weeke, he signifieth that it should come to passe, that the holie of holie ones should be anoynted, slayne, and make an ende of sinne, and sinne offrings appointed in the lawe of Moyses: which things beeing accomplished, and the full nomber of yeeres completed and finished, the citie afterwardes should come to vtter ruine and destruction. And because the Prophet shoulde the better conceiue the verie disposition, and distinct proportion of tymes, in which those things should be brought to passe, the Angel doeth, as it were leading by the hande, instruct him by this deuided partition of weekes: as if this were the purport of the prophesie.

                              osition of the place of Daniel in his 9. Chapter.
                        For so much (O Daniel greatly beloued of God) as thou art so carefull, and zealous for the estate and safetie of thy people; it pleased



Almighty God to heare thee, euen in the beginning of thy prayers, and withall to empart his heauenly will vnto thee, by mee his messenger, sent to this effect, to make thee vnderstand the things that apperteine to thy nation, and the whole estate of that kingdom. For the Lorde hath so decreed by his secrete determination, that this people beyng nowe in captiuitie, shall returne agayne into their natiue country, and the citie and Sanctuarie shalbe restored, and aduaunced to his ancient dignitie and estimation. And if after the restitution and establishment thereof, thou wylt further enquire of the continuaunce and durance of the same: and withall what great enterprises, and manifold successes shal happen therein, vnderstande thou: That seuentie weekes are concluded, and determined vpon this people, which beyng recompted by the Sabbathes of yeeres, or reduced into tenne Iubiles, wil make the nōber of seuen times seuentie, to witte, 490. yeeres: for so many yeeres fully shall that common wealth prosper, vntill wickednes be finished, all curse of sinne be remoued, al sinne offrings abolished, and euerlasting righteousnes be brought in, and all things be accomplished, whatsoeuer



were foretold by ye prophets &amp; visions: finally vntil the holy of holy ones be annoynted.
                     For as the administration of that common wealth was erected at the first for the Messhias his sake, it could not be, that kingdome vtterly to be abolished, before the same Messhias was manifested in the fleshe.
                     
                        
                           The weekes must be distinguished.
                        I haue somewhat declared vnto you concerning the seuentie weekes. For the better perceiuerāce of the orderly proceedings and enterchaunged successes whereof, a threefold distinction of tymes ought seuerally to bee considered. Namely: Seuen weekes, then three score two weekes, and one weeke. In the first seuen weekes,
                           The seuen weekes.
                         all that entercourse of time is comprehended, that must grow betwixt the laying the fundation of the seconde temple &amp; building therof, vntil ye ful finishing of the same: for so many yeres are accompted from the first yere of Cyrus reigne, vnto the vii. or viii. yere of Darius, before ye buylding of the Temple was throughly perfourmed: which will amount to 49. yeres.
                           The lxii. weekes.
                         Agayne the three score two weekes doe note vnto vs, the remnant of the time, wherein Messhias the Lorde shoulde be borne in the citie of Dauid, after that ye citie &amp; Temple were repayred &amp;



buylt againe: which building was cōpleted in the 32. yere of ye reigne of Darius the Assyrian, or Artaxerxes. Now that other one week which remained,
                           The one weeke.
                         doth signifie vnto vs the annoynting, preaching, reuealing &amp; suffering of the same Meschias: &amp; of those other things, which were to ensue after his death. In the middle part of which week,
                           The halfe of the weeke.
                         shal Meschias be slayne: to wit, three yeres &amp; an halfe, after his baptisme and annointing. By which death he shall accomplishe the mysterie of mans redemption, wherof the prophets did so oft prophecie and prognosticate, long time before.
                     The residue of the weeke doth appertayne to the preaching of the Apostles, to ye calling of the Gētiles, to the establishing of the couenant wt many, to the abolishing of the old circūcision, &amp; external sacrifices of ye ceremonial Law, to ye confirmatiō of free remissiō of sins, &amp; to the performāce of ye promise of rising againe, &amp; life euerlasting. All which were of al parts cōpleted, &amp; ended in y• last weeke: that is to say, in those 7. latter yeres, wherein the Meschias shalbe annoynted, slayne, ryse from death to lyfe, ascende vp into heauen, endue his Churche with the inestimable benefites of the holie Ghost, and allure the Gentiles



to the free mercy pronounced by his Gospel: which weeke being added to the former, will make the iust nomber of 70. weekes, to wit, 490. yeres.
                     For so many yeres did the mercifull God of Israel, of his vnspeakeable bountie preserue that nation in peaceable tranquillitie, not for any their deseruings, but for his deare sonnes sake onely, which was to yssue out of that seede &amp; generation. It remaineth now, that we make a proportionable comparison of the nomber of those yeres, with the records of the continuall proceedinges and successes therof. First, this is a matter confessed: That the deliuerie of the Iewes from their captiuitie, was by the Proclamation of Cyrus, the first yere of his reigne, at what time the fundation of the Temple was layd,
                           The building of the Tēple.
                         which being hindered with sundry interruptions, was yet at the last brought to full perfection, in the sixt or seuenth yere of Darius reygne. The Temple beeyng thus perfited in all fourniture,

                         commission was giuen at length to Nehemias, in the xx. yeere of the reygne of the same Darius, with absolute authoritie to repaire their citie againe. The same yere in the 25. daye of the moneth Elul, the wall was erected



and finished: the whole doing whereof lasted 52. dayes only, as Esdras reporteth in his sixt chapter.
                           2. Esdr. 6.7.
                         But houses were not builded as yet, as appeareth in the seuenth chapter: for accomplishment whereof were allowed xii. yeres more, as appeareth playnely in the fift chapter of the same, where you may heare what Nehemias him selfe speaketh after this maner:
                           2. Esdr.

                        From the twentieth yere (sayth he) euen to the xxxii. yere of king Artaxerxes, that is xii. yere, I and my brethren haue not eaten the bread of the gouernour, &amp;c. So that it is euident, that whiles the citie was buylding, so many yeeres passed ouer.
                           2. Esd.

                         For so we reade, the Nehemias gaue his promise to returne to the king and queene, as soone as the work was finished.
                     Thus much touching the ix. chapter of Daniel: neither is this al that Daniel reporteth of the Messhias, for besides this, many other his prophecies doe foreshewe, and as it were directly leade vs by the hande, to the kingdom of Messhias, yea to the very distinct time thereof:
                           Daniel. 
                                 •
                              
                           
                         as is that of the Stone, which being hewen out of a great hill without mās hande, smote the image that represented the foure Monarchies of the worlde, and brake



his head, his breast, his legges, &amp; his feete in pieces, that no place was founde for them, but the stone it selfe became a great mountaine, and filled the whole earth.
                     
                     But what is the purport of al these things? And first, what is meant by the stone hewen downe without hands, &amp; falling from a great hill? what by that striking and breaking the image in pieces? by that huge mountaine? by that exceeding increase of the stone into an vnmeasurable quātitie: the incredible greatnesse whereof ouerthrowing all other kingdomes of the earth, should possesse the whole world besides? Wherūto tend al these? what do they import? what do they represent vnto vs els, thē the same which we perceiue most plainly was accōplished in the sonne of God? who descēding from the highest heauēs into the wō

                        e of a base virgine, &amp; borne of his mother without al carnal knowledge, who alone comming into the world, without all ayde of naturall generation, did vanquishe all power and pompe of the world and the deuill, by holding his peace onely: brake the gates of hell in sunder with suffering onely: ouercame death with dying onely, and purchased thereby an euerlasting kingdome of perpetuall



felicitie for his chosen and elect, which kingdome shall endure in vnmoueable eternitie, aboue, and beyonde all other kingdomes and empires of the worlde. For all other empires standing in most fickle estate, by enterchaunge of elder yeeres waxe transitorie and vanishe awaye, and with mutuall emnitie do pursue eche other to vtter destruction.
                           The onely kingdome of Christ aboue all other is euerlasting.
                         This onely kingdome raysed vp without handes by the eternall God, can not be shyuered with any vyolence, or waxe olde with any processe of tyme, nor be subdued by any force or polycie of man, but with his vnperysheable perpetuitie shall crushe in pieces and weare out all other kingdomes, and it selfe persiste neuerthelesse vnuanquisheable, for euer and euer. And this so incomprehensible Maiestis of this kingdome, the Prophete doeth not in one place alone prophecie shoulde come, nor doeth he promyse it onely, but discouereth also the very mynute and instant of tyme, wherein this kingdome shoulde flouryshe: so that the commendation, wherewith your Ioseph doeth so hyghly aduaunce this Prophete,
                           Ioseph in his 10 booke of Antiquities cap 14.
                         is not vnaptly applyed: To wytte, that he doeth not onely foreshewe



the euents and successes to tymes, (as other prophets doe) but with a most playne viewe, as it were, doth poynt with the finger to the time it selfe, in which all these things should come, that should ensue. &amp;c.
                     I coulde vouche out of the same Daniel sundry sentences, many also out of other prophets, to the like effect: for what els doth the whole propheticall history of the Bible, euen from the beginning to the ende thereof describe vnto vs, then Christ Iesu, &amp; his kingdome, very base &amp; simple in the eye &amp; iudgement of carnall capacitie, but to the spiritual beholders, most beautiful &amp; glorious? What doth the deliuery of Ionas out of the whales belly the thirde day, prefigure vnto vs other, then the resurrection of Christ? What doeth the translating of Elias into heauen in a firy charriot, signifie other, then the ascension of Christ? What doeth that brasen serpent foreshewe other, then Christ crucified vpon the crosse? What doe the manifold afflictions of king Dauid represent, but the continual persecution of Christ in this world? What doth Moyses signifie, but a deliuerer? Iosuah, but the victorious conquest of Christ ouer all his enemies? What doth the rule &amp; gouernmēt

The cause why that butcherie of siely beastes was permitted you for a time, was to enfourme your grossenesse, and tame the hardenesse of your heartes: that so, by viewe of visible signes, and representations of spectable shadowes, the Lorde might traine you along, to the true and pure clensing of sinnes, which was then to come. But nowe, sithence wee are come to the truth it self (wherof ye other were but shadowes) it is a necessarie consequent, yt those things which were sometime esteemed for clean, ye very same again through alteratiō of time, may be accounted not only vncleane,



and defiled, but filthie also, and abominable.

                     But you wil say, that this threatning doth concerne others, and apperteineth nothing at al to you. Yes truly, the very order, proceding and euent of the matter, doe most manifestly conuince, that this diref

                        l threatning was denoūced against you chiefly: whose words that ensue hereupon immediatly, are these: Behold (saith he) I wil send you Elias the prophet, before the cōming of the great and fearful day of the Lord, and he shall turne the heartes of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the childrē to the fathers, lest happly I come and smite the earth with cursing.

                     But I wil surcease to surcharge you with more testimonies, adding onely one or two



places: first out of the booke of Genesis, an
                           •
                         then out of the Prophet Osee: wherein it shal not be needeful to vse long discourse. For who is so ignorant in the holie scriptures, that vnderstandeth not, what is ment by that scepter which the Patriarche Iacob enspired by diuine oracle, did boldly pronounce, should neuer be remoued from the tribe of Iudah?
                        
                           Gene. 49.
                         And who is he at the length, but euen ye same whome the Prophet Esay describeth, saying, I haue giuen him for a gouernour, and teacher of the Gentiles? Which sentence ye holy Patriarche inspired with the same holy ghost, did long before, in the same sense professe, though in other wordes: And the Gentiles shalbe gathered vnto him. But as then was not the scepter yet of power in Israel. But ye godly grayheaded father foreseing lōg before, the euents of things to come, did prophesie of Iudah in this wise: The Scepter or Mace of the empire shall not departe from Iudah, nor a Lawgiuer from betweene his feete, vntill Silo come, and the gathering of the Gentiles shalbe vnto him. Howsoeuer some rascal Thalmudistes do practise to peruert this place wt most friuolous cauillatiōs: yea though all the start vp Rabbines woulde



burst in sunder, yet can this sentence by no violent wrest be framed appliable otherwise, but that two speciall matters must necessarily be grounded thereupon. First, that Iudah and his tribe should be inuested in the title, and the interest of the kingdome. Next, that this prerogatiue should endure vnmoueable, vntil Mes
                           •
                        hias did come, vnto whome the Gentiles should gather them selues. And to the same effect tendeth the interpretation of Ionathas and others,
                           Thargum Hierosolymī
                              tanum, written by Ionathas
                                 •
                               vpō the 49 chap of Genesis.
                         who liued long before the age of Christ, whose wordes, who listeth to heare, are these: The kings seat shall not be taken or depart from the house of Iudah:
neither shall Lawgiuers want of their childrens children vntil the time that Messhias shal come, to whom the kingdome doeth belong. And all the kings of the earth shall become his vassalles. How beautifull is this Messhias, that shall come to continue in the house of Iudah? he shal girde vp his loynes &amp; go forth to battel against his enemies, and the kings and their princes shalbe slaine. He shall die the ri

with their vines, and their winepresses with the wine: the fieldes shalbe adorned with beautifull blossome by reason of the aboundance of fruites of beasts &amp; sheepe &amp;c.
Thus much thought I good to rehearse out of Ionathas: yet haue we no neede (praysed bee God) to vouche any commentaries of the Iewes, to manifest the mysteries of the holy Scripture, namely sith there can bee no better interpreter of the propheticall scriptures then time, and approued experience of the successes thereof.
                     The testimonie that I thought good to borow out of Osee;
                           Osee against Israel.
                         most worthy to be noted of you that are Iewes, is that, which he setteth downe in the first Chapter of his prophesie: where the Prophet inueighing against Israel vseth this speach: 
                           Call his name (
                              •
                           aieth he) not my people, because you are not my people, therefore will I not be yours. &amp;c.
                        Whereby you may plainely perceiue the saying of S. Paul confirmed by the Prophet, to wit: The same which he teacheth concerning the naturall branches, which he sayde were hewen of from the Oliue tree. And now (ye men of Israel) where is that your arrogant vaine glorious vaint of the ofspring of your



kindred?
If to be issued of the race of Abraham be prised so highly in the sight of God, what meaneth then this casting away of the Israelites, mencioned by the Prophet? what signifieth that speciall choyse, and calling of the Gentiles, and the wilde Oliue tree to be planted in their place? for so wee reade the promise set downe by the Prophet:
                           Osee .1.
                         
                        And the nomber of the children of Israel (sayeth hee) shalbe as the sande of the sea, which can not be measured and tolde. And in the place where it was saide, yee are not my people, it shalbe sayd vnto them, you are the sonnes of the liuing God It was a singular prerogatiue for them not being Israelites borne, to be named and nombred amongst the true children of Israel. But that other did farre surmount, that being before the broode of the deuil, they should now be called the sonnes of ye liuing God.
                           The calling of the Gentiles, according to Osee the Prophet.
                         And to whom (I beseech you) is this vnspeakable benefite promised? forsooth neither to the Israelites nor to ye Iewes, nor to thē which seemed to apperteine vnto God, but vnto thē which were altogether seuered, &amp; estranged from God: ye very abiect, &amp; rascall Gentiles, barbarous &amp; vncircumcised heathē perdie, whome the incomprehensible mercie



of God will ioyne neere vnto him selfe, and wil engraffe them into the roote of his owne naturall Oliue tree, hauing first sawed of the naturall branches, in whose steade he shal gather the Gentiles together, from out a wylde Oliue tree, in such plentifull aboundance and infinite heapes, as will not be comprehended within the territorie of Palestine onely, but like vnto the sandes of the sea,
                           The multitude of the cōuerts Gentiles, after ye testimonie of ye Prophets.
                         will replenish the whole worlde, farre and wide from the rising of the sunne, to the going downe of the same.
                     Ye haue heard the minde and purport of the Prophet, which if ye suppose to be as yet not accomplished for your behoofe, through the Gospel of Messhias, our Lord and Sauiour, open your eyeliddes, (if you bee not blinde) and beholde the innumerable multitude of people, and tongues, which euerie where throughout all the worlde, doe professe the true worshipping of God: nomber them, if you be able: but if the quantitie be so infinite, as the sande of the sea, exceeding all reache &amp; compasse of nomber, you may easily coniecture thereby (ye men of Israel) into what streightes your wilf

                     Of the which I wyll speake more hereafter by the help of Christ,
                           An exhortation to the Gentiles and Christians.
                         after that I haue debated somewhat with the Gentiles (whom the Lorde hath called) and haue in fewe words exhorted my dearely beloued brethren in Christ, to be myndeful of those things, according



to my simple vnderstāding. And yet I see no cause, why I should spend any long time herein: for I doe firmely trust, that all those sayings are already noted by you, yea &amp; deepely imprinted in your mindes, which the Apostle doth teach here, touching the due obseruation of our calling, so that mine exhortatiō shal not be much needeful in this place. First, I suppose that you are not ignorant of the great rigor that God executed vpon his people, wherwith if he would haue punished you, what might haue letted him I pray you? Yea rather what was the cause, why he did not punish you? Do ye thinke that any of you were endued with any such excellencie, as ye myght thereby challenge any preeminence aboue the Iewishe nation? Were not wee sometimes euen in the same plyght, that many Iewes remayne in at this day: to witte, vnfaithfull vnbeleeuers in the sight of God? Then if God excluded the Iewes for their vnbeleefe (as he dyd) what argument myght enduce him to haue more compassion vpō the Gentiles, who were sometymes as voyde of fayth, as they are nowe? Whereby you may perceyue (my deare brethren) howe the inestimable mercie of God doeth miraculously



woorke in mans election, beyonde all hope and capacitie of man, who hath compassion on whome it pleaseth him, and hardeneth the hearts of whome him lysteth. That it may ryghtly be sayde, That it consisteth neyther in the power of the wylling, nor of the running to obtayne mercie, but in the mercyfull God. If this be not yet apparaunt vnto you, looke vpon those Israelites, that are yet forsaken of God: who were sometymes in his fauour, and you admitted in their steade. What was the cause thereof, I praye you? Thou wyle saye, that the Naturall braunches were broken off, that I myght be engraffed in. It is true in deede, they were broken off, as thou sayest. But good sir, this was not done for thy sake, but for their owne vnbeleefe sake. And yet it followed hereupon, that we were planted in: neither is this false, that thou speakest. But this is not ye point I seke for: there is yet an other thing, to witte, not whether the Iewes were broken off: But I woulde fayne knowe, what vertue was in thee, that myght procure thee to be engraffed in their place. And wherfore should they, beyng natural branches, be hewen off? If you compare



with them in auncienty of race, they did farre excell you in auncientie of byrth, and dignitie of parentage. For they were your elders farre, by which tytle they myght lawfully challenge the preeminence of the birthright. If you stande with them vpon deseruinges, howe precisely dyd they pursue the prescript rule of ryghteousnesse? whereof thou dydst take no regarde at all, although in trueth they were neuer able to attayne the perfection they sought for. If thou contende with them in excellencie of zeale, they wanted not very feruent and entier zeale, albeit their earnest bent affection wāted true vnderstāding. If thou boast vpon thy vpryghtnesse of lyfe, surely we Gentiles were in no respect comparable vnto them in conuersation of life. If thou haue regarde to the paynefulnes of the toyle, or estate of the calling, they did beare the brunt and heate of the sunne, and were then first, when as thou camest into the vineyarde skarsely amongst the last, euen at the last caste. All which notwithstanding thou doest playnely perceyue, that they are rent off from the naturall stocke, whereupon they grewe, and thy selfe beyng otherwise a starueling boughe of a wylde Oliue



tree, and of an vnfruitefull stocke, art adopted into the inheritaunce of the sonnes of God.
                     What shall we saye then? Is God to be accused of ingratitude, because he departed from his owne? or of inconstancie, for makyng innouation of his auncient coue

                           The promises of God are not boūd to place, nor persons.
                         He made a promyse to Abraham onely, that out of his seede a sprought shoulde yssue, in whome all nations and kynredes of the earth should be blessed. For he doeth not saye, In thee all nations shall be blessed: but in thy seede: in whome all men truely shoulde be rewarded with lyfe euerlasting, as many as would receyue him: as on the other side, he that dyd refuse him, shoulde obtayne no mercie nor fauour at Gods handes. And it is not to be doubted, that this seede is the very Sonne of God, whome if the Iewes woulde once at the last louingly embrace, they shoulde no more be excluded from the benefite of the promyse. But for as much as they doe yet not onely refuse him, but continue also their cancred outrage against



him with execrable cursings, and cruel spoyling this seede in his members so horribly: there is no cause, why they shoulde presume to challenge any prerogatyue of the promyse, sith the person could not prescribe vpō the promyse as made vnto him, but in respecte of the seede. But why was not this bene

Some question in deede myght be mooued herein, if the same had not alreadie bene discussed by his Prophetes sufficiently: to wytte, That the Iewes them selues shoulde loathe, reiect, yea and procure the death of their owne Messhias. And if yet any person wyll seeme so captious, to be further inquisitiue to learne why the Iewes are not able to comprehende that, which is layde open to the Gentiles, the same may be satisfyed with this

                         that no ryghteousnesse was acceptable in the syght of God, but that which consisted in perfourming the workes of the Lawe, and celebrating the Sacrifices,



and ceremonies of the same, and that this false conceaued opinion, so deeply rooted in the heartes of men, coulde by no meanes els be extirped and plucked out, but by the vndermyning, and vtter ouerthrowe of the name of that nation, the whole common wealth thereof, together with all the Sacrifices and ceremonies appertayning thereunto. Heereof sprang all that blyndenesse, and subuersion of the Iewes, albeit the same blyndnes infected not all in generall, nor the same destruction was allotted vnto them, to endure for euer.
                     But by this example it may happely bee thought, that God did execute too much crueltie and rigour agaynst those seely wretches the Iewes. Admitte in deede, that it was so. This was therefore a good lesson to forewarne vs, accordyng to Saint Paules aduertisement, that wee shoulde duely, and with carefull consideration, exactly examine the seueritie of God:

be raysed to thankefulnesse and duetyfull loue towardes God. A very lyuely example truely of Gods seueritie is heere expressed in the Iewes, who beeyng fallen from their auncient dignitie, were ouerwhelmed with such blyndenes, that notwithstanding Christ (whose comming they looked for many hundred yeeres) was come already, and conuersaunt amongst them, they shoulde yet pursue him with contumelious reproches, rayle vpon him,

                         premeditatyng and continually recording the example of the Iewes, wee become more circumspecte, and learne by their ruyne, what we ought to feare, and what wee ought to eschewe? First, That beeyng taught by the Iewes



vnbeliefe, we endeuour by all meanes possible with earnest and heartie supplications and prayers, to escape that daungerous gulfe of incredulous vnbeliefe. But ye will demaunde what kinde of vnbeliefe that was wherewith they were blynded. Doe they not beleue in one God maker of heauen and earth?

                         do they not confesse as well as we, that the same God is most mightie, most mercifull, yea a most righteous iudge, and rewarder of deedes? The answere is readie.

                         If we were Angels or such kinde of men, as could not possibly decline out of the way, or had neuer fallen into errour, then would this faith haue bene a sufficient couer to shroude vs, in that we might neede no further mediatour. But now being altogether sinful, borne of sinfull parents, enuironed with the whole bodie of sinne, what do we els when we call vpon God without regarde of the mediator,
                           A perillous thing to seek God without the mediator.
                         then rayse his wrath, sharpen his vengeance, and prouoke him to aggrauate the iudgement of our damnation, and (to speake the words of Esay) procure our dwelling with deuouring fire,
                           Esay .33.
                         and make our habitations in euerlasting flames? For what can be more dreadfull for mans weake nature, then to debate



with God without Christ? From yt which I beseech our sauiour Christ to preserue vs al.
                     The other is, left we should foolishly flatter our selues at other mens harmes. Faith is the gift of God, and consisteth not in anie demonstration of mans imagination: wherevnto if it were possible to attaine by force of nature, by workes, by dewe deseruings of the Lawe, by ceremonies, by parentage, or nobilitie of race: surely the Iewes as they were our auncients in yeres, so approched neerer the election then we.
                           No man ought to bee proude of his faith.
                         But considering this faith dependeth vpon the free mercy of God onely, and the free distribution of his especial election: and thou through the onely kindnes of the Lord, art endued with that blessing, that is denied to others, thou mayest worthily reioyce in this thy felicitie. But beware that this singular felicitie suggest not matter of pride, as may make thee treade downe, and scorne the calamities of the afflicted: but learne rather by their example, what thou mayest feare thy selfe. Wherein no man can enstruct thee more piththily, then saint Paul: Be not proude in minde (saieth he) but feare: for if God spared not the natural bran

thou, whosoeuer thou be, that stādest in faith, doest not stand so assured, that thou maist not fall: neither is their vnbelief such, as is ouerspread ouer them all, or such as shall endure for euer, and is vnrecouerable. For as there are very many Iewes (as I saide before) which do confesse and professe Christ (as is this one Iewe whome ye see here present at this time) so is the Lord mightie, and of power to haue compassion vpon the remnant, and rayse them vp, which are yet forsaken, and troden vnder foote.
                     And that yee may the better vnderstand, that God is of power able to do the same, as also his determined purpose herein, and what he willeth vs to conceiue thereof, I will declare vnto you the iudgement, and hope of S. Paul touching the same, where of he doeth also vnder a certaine secret mysterie make vs partakers. And to this purpose it semed good to s. Paul to aduertise vs that are Gentiles, that we shoulde bee well aduised, least being puft vp with pride, and swelling with a vaine arrogant persuasion of our owne strength, wee conceiue better of our selues then is requisite, because wee seeme to stand in better estimation then the Iewes: therefore



he would not haue vs ignorant of this great blindnes of the Iewes, as the which neither happened to all the Nation in general, but in part, vpon Israel: nor that the same was past recouery, but should endure only so long, vntill the full nomber of the Gentiles were accomplished. And then (saith he) it shal come to passe, that all the people of Israel shalbe saued: which testimonie of the Apostle is a sufficient argument to declare, that the Iewes shalbe restored againe, if I be not deceiued. But when that returne of the Iewes shalbe, the diuines are not fully agreed vpon.
                           The prophesie of S. Paul concerning ye

Unlesse peraduenture we will interprete this fulnes in this wise: that the Iewes shal continue so long in blindenes, as the Gentiles did in vnbeliefe, whiles the Iewes remayned in beliefe: and that the fulnes of the Gentiles shall seeme to be accomplished,

Iewes did first enioy their synagogue wtout ye Gentiles. The nomber of which yeres will not vary much, if ye computation be proportionably made. For, if according to this rule, ye deriue your nomber frō the first institutiō of the Iewes common wealth, vnto the vtter subuersion of the same, ye shall finde 1564. the course of which yeres if ye compare with the calling of the Gentiles, that is to say, from the time that the holie ghost was sent, vntil this present time, the nomber of yeres wil not be farre vnequal. And yet in my iudgment it shall not be amisse, if a man make his calculation, hauing relation to those times whereof the Lord him selfe made mencion in the Euangelist Luke.
                           Luke. 21.
                         
                        And Ierusalem (saieth he) shal be troden vnder foote of the Gentiles, vntil the tyme of the Gentiles bee fulfilled.
                     
                     But the knowledge of the certaine moments and appointed minutes of that time, we commit vnto the Lord. This onely wee learne most assured out of S. Paul, that God hath decreed vpon an infallible certaintie of time, wherein the Gentiles shall mount to their fulnes, and the Iewes also after that fulnes of time shall returne vnto the fayth.



For speedy &amp; good successe whereof, this one thing doth minister plentiful matter of good hope, yt our Lord Iesu Christ hath vouchsafed to cleanse his Churches euery where almost so happily in these our daies, &amp; purged them frō al offences &amp; stumbling blocks, which occasioned ye Iewes to withdraw themselues so long from the participation of our faith.
                     
                        
                           A complaint against idolatrie vsed in Christian Churches.
                        And here I might vse offred opportunitie, to exclame against the presumptuous boldenesse of those persons whatsoeuer they were, which presumed to thrust into Temples and Churches of Christians, images, and counterfaites of hee saintes and shee saintes at the first, and to conueye the pure worshipping of ye inuisible God, to the representations of visible things, contrary to the prescript ordinance of ye Law of God, cōtrary to reason &amp; nature, contrary to ye approued custome of ye elders, &amp; cōtrary to al example of ye Patriarches, Prophets &amp; Apostles: out of which puddle as issued wonderful stench, so amongst al other, nothing more noysome thē those pestilent Botches of imageworship, breadworship, wineworship, crosseworship, signes &amp; pourtraictes of visible creatures, ye view wherof caused the true and sincere professiō of ye christians to be lothsome to ye Iewes, to their great hinderāce



and preiudice. For what maruel was it if the Iewes (yt were taught by ye prescript rule of gods law to abhorre worshipping of images) entring into ye churches of christiās, &amp; beholding ye walles, pillers, &amp; al ye corners 
                           •
                        hereof, bedawbed wt painted, &amp; carued idoles, besides innumerable other bables of imagery, perceiuing also opē market to be made, not only of ye picture of ye crosse, but of the sacrament of bread &amp; wyne also, displayed &amp; blazed abroad not after ye maner of cōmunicating, but gloriously vaunted wt singular magnificence to be honoured and kneeled vnto: what maruel was it (I say) if they being offended with this open idolatrie, did so long refraine from vs, and from the discipline of our faith?
                     But it is wel now, thāked be Christ,
                           A good beginning of a reformed Church amongst Christians.
                         yt these offensiue baggage &amp; image worshippings are for yt more part defaced &amp; scraped out of christian churches, &amp; the ancient puritie of christiā profession, is begun to take so good footing, yt now amongst vs remaine no dregges in our temples, in our religion, nor in our doctrine, that may minister iust occasion of offence to the Iewes, or any other enemies, though thei inueigh our religion neuer so much. And I would to God, al other that professe ye name



of christians, would yeeld their like endeuour to the abolishment of al corruptions of religion, and inciuilitie of liuing out of their cō
                        gregations, which may breede any further lothsomnes to ye Iewes. Truly this is much to be lamented, that our aduersaries can find no blemish of iust quarell in the person of Christ Iesu, whose name we would seeme to professe: and on the other side, to wit, in vs nothing consonant, and agreeable to the true touchstone of Gods holy word, and Christes religion, whereof we beare the name, but all things repugnant and vnlike the pure &amp; first patterne thereof.
                     But I wil not aduenture further vpō this quauemire: the sincke is deeper thē can be in this place, or at this time scowred or lanched. But sithence our present purpose is now to treate only of the conuersion of the Iewes: of the good successe whereof, as there is no hope at all els then by purging and cleansing the filthie puddles of our superstitions, the vnsauerie stenche whereof the Iewes can by no meanes disgest: what remayneth for vs to do (my deare brethren and honourable fathers in the Lord) but that euery of vs in our vocation, employe all our endeuour, facultie



and power, that nothing may be committed amongst vs, in our default from henceforth, whereby the true religion of Christ (which he gaue most pure without spot or blemish) may be defiled, and brought into hatred and obloquie, and blasphemed amongst the Iewes, Turkes, Pagans, and vnbeleeuing infidels. My meaning here tendeth not to ye determining of controuersies in sects, nor of doutful controuersies debated in schooles: the censure wherof, I commit to the great masters, and doctors in diuinitie: Onely my request at this time is, that those grosse monuments of manifest idolatrie, those fantasticall deuises and friuolous forgeries of signes and Images, and those stagelike gestures and pelting trumperies, frequented in Churches, as are the praying for the dead, worshipping of creatures &amp; signes, forbidding priests marriages, &amp; such like pieuish absurdities (wherwith the Iewes were neuer acqua

desire to be ioyned to the sonne of God: or if we will not do this for the Iewes sake, let vs yet at the least haue due regard to our owne estate. We haue bene plagued sufficiently enough by the Turkes and Saracenes for our idolatrie, if we respect the sundrie ouerthrowes, famines, slaughters, and alterations of kingdomes, wherewith the Christians haue bene miserably tormented manie hundred yeres, to the great delight of the Iewes: neither is any hope almost of redresse from great calamities, like to ensue, vnlesse we cast away this worshipping of idoles out of Christian congregations and Temples, (as I said before) and by this meanes enter vpon a new course of better conuersation and purer worshipping of God.
                     But forasmuch as this notable enterprise of reformatiō of life, and purer discipline, hath ouer many aduersaries at this daye, such as will by no persuasion suffer themselues to be allured frō their accustomed impietie: &amp; that this wicked age ministreth no hope of recouerie by exhortation, and that nothing can auaile now to bring this to passe, but supplications and praiers: Let euery of vs most humbly ioyne together in earnest &amp; heartie praier,

                     MEn and brethrē, to whom God hath reuealed in these later dayes the secrete of his sonne which was hidden from you many ages, it is not vnknowen vnto you how that in the dayes of our forefathers God chose vs to be a precious people vnto himself aboue all the people that are vpon the earth:
                        Deut. 7.6.
                      and he loued vs and chose vs, not because we were mo in number then anie people: for we were the fewest of all people: but hee chose vs onely because hee loued vs, and because he would keepe the othe which he had sworne vnto our fathers Abraham, Isaac, &amp; Iacob. By vertue of which promise the same our Lord and God, whose name is Iehouah, brought our fathers by a mightie hande and deliuered them out of the house of bondage from the hande of Pharaoh King of Egypt, that they might knowe that the Lorde their



God is the God in deede, the faithfull God which keepeth couenant and mercie vnto thē that loue him and keepe his cōmandements, euen to a thousand generations. According to which great &amp; vnspeakeable louing kindnesse, he kept, and preserued our fathers in the land of Israel, which he had giuen them vnder the obedience of his Lawe in such seruice of sacrifices and other rites, as he had appointed them to be done and practised all the dayes of their liues in the citie of Ierusalem, where was his Temple built vpon the mount Sion, so long as they kept them selues in obedience to the same Lawe and ordinances. But when they forsaked the Lord their God, and cleaued vnto false gods, he rewarded them to their face because they hated him, and brought them to destruction by deliuering them into the handes of manie enemies: as into the hands of Nabuchadnezer, by whom they were caried into captiuitie to Babylon, and there remained the dayes foretolde them by our Prophet Ieremie: Fulfilling thereby the wordes of our Prophet Moseh foretelling vs that it should so be, if we forsooke the Lord our God: and leauing vs their posteritie an example thereby, that,



if we followed like iniquitie, like seueritie of punishment should ouertake vs: As it came to passe, and is fulfilled in the eyes of all the world by this captiuitie which we are now in and haue been in, we and our forefathers, euer since the death of that righteous man Iesus Christ: whome the Scribes and Pharisies and Elders of our people deliuered into the handes of Pontius Pilate to be put to death, being before betrayed into their handes by one of his owne disciples that sonne of perdition Iudas Ishcarioth. As our forefathers then pronoūced against them selues, Let his bloud be vpon our heads and vpon our children: so it is come to passe by the righteous iudgement of that mightie &amp; dreadfull God. For euen from those dayes vnto this present the whole house of Israel, that is, wee yt come of the stocke of Abraham after the fleshe, is &amp; are strangers out of the land of Israel our owne countrie without Lawe or Prophets, without all exercise of his statutes and ordinances concerning his worshippe prescribed vnto vs by the hande of his seruant Moseh. This long and weariesome captiuitie hath consumed a great number of our forefathers, 
                        •
                     nd hath caused some of vs frō time to time,



through the grace and loue of God wherewith hee loueth vs for the promise sake, to thinke vpō our promised Messhiach: conferring these dayes of sorowe &amp; calamitie with our former captiuities of our fathers, which were nothing so many in number of yeres, nor so grieuous for want of our Prophets. These fiftene hundreth yeres haue we bene strangers, &amp; these fiftene hūdreth yeres haue we lacked our Prophets: a thing not seen at any time before whē we &amp; our fathers were caried into a strange land. For in Egypt they had Mosheh &amp; Aaron: and in Babylon they had Ieremie &amp; Daniel, besides Ezra, Nechemiah, and manie other: onely in this captiuitie is Israel left desolate and our Prophets cleane gone. Whereof when it pleased God I should haue consideration, I was lead to thinke that our Messhiach is come, and that our long looking for an other was but in vaine: And yt rather, for that I see ye wordes of Iacob our father accomplished where hee sayeth,
                        Gen. 49.10
                      The Scepter shall not depart from Iudah, nor a lawegiuer from betweene his feete vntill Shiloh come: and the people shal be gathered vnto him. For the Scepter and gouernement was continued in the house of



                     Iudah, as our fathers accord, vntill the comming of this man Iesus: in whom if it were not continued according to the woordes of our scriptures, it hath failed and wanted euer since. For since the dayes of that iust man there hath bene no Scepter amongest vs, neither haue we or do we runne for iudgements vnto Ierusalem: So that if ye wordes of our father Iacob be true, That the Scepter should not depart from the house of Iudah vntill Shilo came, and there is no Scepter nor Lawegiuer nowe in that house: then must it needes be that this man Iesus, whō you confesse and beleeue, is that Shilo which was to come: and is that childe of whom one or our Prophetes sayeth,
                        Esa. 9.6.
                      Unto vs a childe is borne, and vnto vs a sonne is giuen, and the gouernement is vpon his shoulder, And hee shall call his name Wonderfull, Counseller, The mightie God, The euerlasting Father, the Prince of peace, the increase of his gouernement and peace shall haue none end, he shall sitte vpon the throne of Dauid and vpon his kingdome to order it &amp; to stablish it with iudgement and iustice from henceforth, euen for euer. The zeale of the Lord of hosts will performe this. This man then no



doubt is that Messhiach which was looked for according to promise, and our fathers and people acknowledge not, fulfilling in them selues the wordes of their owne mouth, His bloud be vpon our heads. In deede it seemed strange to me, and doth to the rest of my brethren according to the flesh, euē vnto this daye, in whome this blindnesse and hardnesse of heart is in part continued through occasion giuen by them that professe the name of this man Iesus: And not onely in vs which are of the house of Israel, but in other, as the Turkes and Mahomets which are of the race of Ishmael. For had it not bene for the great and manifolde Idolatrie that is committed and vsed amongst the Christians almost in all places where his Name is professed, manie of our nation had repēted in sackcloth and ashes, and had come to this man Iesus their brother after the flesh, from whom they are nowe estranged and go astraye. But wel is it written in your Law, Woe be vnto him by whom offence commeth: according as it is written in our Lawe, Cursed be the man that layeth a stumbling block in the waye of his neighbour, and all the people shall saye Amen. But when it pleased God to bring



me into this land, which I must for the same cause call a blessed land, and I sawe therein no such impedimēt as holdeth our eyes blinded in other places: It was a meanes, I must needes confesse, that made mee more deepely to enter into the former consideration of our long captiuitie, &amp; better to thinke of the wordes of our Prophets, and the promises set downe by them touching our Messhiach. For the wall that maketh a separation betweene our nation the stocke of Abraham, and you the Gentiles, is in your respect and in your behalfe broken downe: so that I can not iustly say of you, as we &amp; our fathers and Elders saye of all other, vsing in all our bookes and writings to call and accompt of them by no other name but Baale abodazara Idolatrous masters, and lords of strāge worshippe: A thing so detestable vnto vs, as nothing more concerning our Lawe, being in deede the first and chiefest of our commandements giuen vs by the hand of Mosheh, and so often repeated vnto vs, as no one thing more in all our scriptures: Besides the manifest anger of God shewed against it,

when he was gone vp into ye mount to fetche the Lawe. When our fathers were to enter into the lande of promise, the first and principall point required of them was this:
                        Deut. 7,1. 3.4.5.6.7.
                      When the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possesse it, &amp; shall roote out many nations be

                        •
                     ages with them, neither giue thy daughter vnto his sōne, nor take his daughter vnto thy sonne: for they will cause thy sonne to turne away from me, &amp; to serue other gods: then will the wrath of the Lord waxe whotte against you, and destroy thee sodainly:
                        Deu. 12,2. 3.
                      But thus you shall deale with them, you shall ouerthrowe their altars, and breake downe their pillers, and you shall cut downe their groues and burne their grauē images with fyre.
                  The seueritie of this Lawe and the false



worshippe that we and our fathers behold in them that professe the name of this man Iesus, withholdeth vs from comming to make any couenāt of peace with you, from ioyning hands with you, and entring into that familiaritie with you, which should be betweene them that worship one God.
                        Deu. 22,10
                      We are commanded in our Lawe not to plowe with an oxe and an asse, neither to weare any garmēt of linsie wolsie: we vnderstande it so, that we may not ioyne God and Idols together: we may not serue our Lorde otherwise than he hath commanded vs, saying,
                        Deut. 5,32
                      Turne not aside to the right hand nor to the lefte. For he is a iealouse God, and we are chosen to be an holie people vnto him: which we are taught we can not be, vnlesse we keepe this commandement, Thou shalt haue none other Gods but one: and this, Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any grauen image, nor the likenesse of any thing. And because they do so, we haue bene withholden by the commandement of our God from making any couenant with them, or hearkening vnto any of their Prophets &amp; teachers: for that were but to make Israel to sinne, and to prouoke the holy one to anger. When they talke with vs, they saye



they are not such as our Prophets speake of, who worshipped beasts and other creatures, as the sunne &amp; the moone: but they worship onely the creature of man, who was made to the image of God, and by whome God hath wrought great and marueilous workes vpō the earth. To whom we answere by ye words of our Lawe, that all idolatrie is forbiddē vs: the commaundement forbiddeth not one thing more than an other, neither giueth greater libertie for one thing, than for an other: but saith in these wordes, Thou shalt not make the likenesse of anie thing that is in heauen aboue or in the earth beneath, or in the water vnder the earth, thou shalt not bowe downe to them nor serue thē. Whatsoeuer it be, it is forbidden by our commandement. And if anie creature might be worshipped, reason would the sunne &amp; moone should haue that honour done them: for they serue vs to greatest purposes, &amp; by them we reape daily profit. Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob: Mosheh, Samuel, and Elizahu with the rest of the Prophets were good men, and by them God wrought wonderfull things, and yet we neuer worshipped any of them. And we can not thinke that this wisedome was or should haue bene hidden from all them, and all our



fathers, if it had bene so great wisdome in the sight of our God. They say vnto vs oftentimes, that they do not worshippe them as Gods, but they worship God in them. Neither are the Heathen, we say, that are rounde about vs so blinded with the imagination of their heartes, as that they thinke that the stockes &amp; stones carued, or the tables which they paint them selues, to be God: but they are persuaded that the liuing God may bee worshipped and serued in them. And as for the creature that is worshipped, or in whome the liuing God is worshipped, whether it be better than an other and more to be accompted of than an other, that is not it that maketh false worship: but the commandement which sayeth, Thou shalt not make the likenesse of any thing. And yet those common Christians go verie farre: for the Christians of Spayne &amp; Portugal haue it written in their bookes, as in one which they call Contemplationes del Idiota ala virgen Maria, That that virgin is the Lordes treasure, and that she bestoweth giftes and graces vpon hir seruantes to make them worthy dwelling houses for hir blessed sonne and the holy Ghost: that hir mercie often time pardoneth them, whome the iustice of hir sonne might condemne:



that she doth plentifully enriche thē that serue hir with the holy Ghost, and defendeth them most mightily from the enemie: to witte, from the world, the f
                        •
                     esh and the deuill: and that our saluation lieth in hir hands. But our Lawe teacheth vs that our God Iehouah is all sufficient, and that all treasures are in his handes: he giueth to whom he listeth: and from whom he listeth he holdeth backe. He saieth he will not giue his glorie to an other, and what is more glorious to him than to be acknowledged of his creatures to be the onely fountayne of all goodnesse, to be our lightening and saluation, that wee may dwell confidently vnder the shadowe of hi

                      winges, who will be called vpon in the daye of our necessitie and he will heare vs.
                  And therefore as that doctrine is contrarie to the doctrine of our Prophet, &amp; is cast away of you which in this countrey beleue in the man Iesus: So I haue more willingly and with a more readie minde hearkened to the wordes of your teachers, and learned by Gods good working to knowe more of our promised Messhiach, thā our fathers beleue: but no more than our scriptures most truely conteine: Being assured that, seing you haue



the wordes of our Prophets, and do not followe strange gods, you are to be hearkened vnto. For by our Lawe no Prophet may bee reiected but the false prophet, who seketh to turne vs awaye from the Lorde our God to serue other gods. And therefore as I haue learned by the wordes of your teachers, conferring them with our Lawe and Prophets, that our promised King &amp; Messhiach is not a Prince of this worlde, as one that hath to establishe a temporal kingdome amongst vs: but a spirituall, whose power and might consisteth in gouerning vs by his Spirit, and forgiuing the sinnes of Israel, and taking awaye the iniquities of Iacob, bearing in his owne bodie the chastisement of our peace, that is, the chastisemēt that worketh and getteth vs peace as our Prophets tell vs: So I confesse &amp; acknowledge that he is already come, and that it is he of whom our Prophet spake, Behold the dayes come, sayth the Lord,
                        Iere. 23.5,6
                      that I wil raise vnto Dauid a righteous branche, and a King shall raigne and prosper, and shall execute iudgement and iustice in the earth: in his daies Iudah shalbe saued and Israel shal dwell safely, and this is the name whereby they shall call him, The Lord our righteousnes.


                     
And therefore being heartilie sorie for my so long going astraye from the faith of this man Iesus after the euill leading of my countrie men and kinsmen after the flesh, for whose speedie turning to the Lorde I most earnestly praye, and giuing the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, heartie thanks for the working of his grace in me, by bringing me from the darkenes, wherein my fathers haue walked these fifteen hundreth yeres, into his marueilous light, to beholde the face of his Christ our true and onely Meshiach: I protest vnto you, that I vtterly forsake my former wayes and the steps that my nation walketh in, leauing with them not only that false looking for an other Christ, but my name also which was giuen me at my circumcision (being Iehuda) though in it selfe it be honourable: desiring that as I haue receiued a new gift from the Lord, so in token thereof I may be called Nathanael: the summe of which gifte, so farre forth as he hath as yet reuealed vnto me, I here confesse &amp; acknowledge before you, that you may be witnesses with me of my faith in Christ that Meshiach, whom you beleeue in, and I receiue for my redeemer.
                  
                     I confesse with my mouthe and beleeue from my heart, that the man Iesus Christ borne of the virgin Marie (according to the foretelling of our Prophets) and so, by the flesh he toke of hir, descending of the seede &amp; stocke of Dauid for the continuance of his kingdome for euer ouer his people Israel, is the vndoubted Meshiach promised to our fathers for the redemption and deliuerie of vs his people out of the captiuitie wee are in: which is not the captiuity of Egypt or Babylon, or the captiuitie of the Romanes Empire, which we haue iustly deserued by the shedding of his innocent bloud through betraying and deliuering him into the handes of the wicked to be crucified: but the captiuitie of sinne, death, and damnation, prefigured vnto vs by our Prophets vnder the shadowe of the foresaid captiuities of Egypt and Babylon. Which things because our fathers vnderstoode not through ignorance of our scriptures, they did all those thinges which they wrought, against that holy one our only redeemer &amp; sauiour: &amp; haue by that meanes estranged them selues and their posteritie from the common wealth in deede of Israel, that is to saye, from the communion of the



sainctes and childrē of God which make p

                  And therefore in full assurance of this full and perfect and last deliuerie wrought for all them that are both nigh and farre of, that is, for all that beleeue by that man Iesus whom our Prophets forenamed Immanuel, which is by interpretation, God with vs, resting &amp; reposing my selfe in this horne of saluation, I looke for no other Messhiach and Christ to come hereafter, as the rest of my kindred an

                        •
                     e of our Prophets call the voyce in the wildernesse sent to prepare the wayes of this our King and holy one our redeemer, conuerting by his preaching the fathers hearts vnto the children, and the simple and vnbeleeuers to the obedience of the righteous: For which cause also (as our wordes meane) he was by



our fathers called Thesby, which is by interpretation, the seruant of God to worke repentance by.
                  And because this man, who was appointed from the beginning to be our redeemer &amp; deliuerer out of the captiuity of sinne, was to worke that great and marueilous redemption by his owne death (as was prefigured vnto vs by our Passeouer and all our sacrifices, and also declared by our Prophets) which he performed in his time appointed, being deliuered into the handes of Pontius Pilate by our Scribes and Pharisies to be put to that shamefull death of the Crosse, whereof it is written in our lawe, Cursed be the man that hangeth on the tree: which is so well knowen to al the house of Israel, that they call him euen to this daye in despite Talui, which is by interpretation, Hanged. Therefore I also confesse and beleeue that our sacrifices commanded in our Law, by the hand of Mosheh, are at an end &amp; not to be vsed any more: being in deede but shadowes of this bodie and truthe which was performed in and by this our Immanuel, God with vs. And therefore I most willingly and freely renounce that doctrine of our Elders, which
