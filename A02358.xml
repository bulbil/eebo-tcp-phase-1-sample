            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

               NEver more subtily intended the Gibeonits vnder pretence of olde Furniture, &amp; comming from a-farre, to deceiue the Lordes People, nor vnder the like pretence of Antiquitie novv, doeth Babels
               
brood intende to doe the same to Bethels Children. Neither more braggingly did ever the carnall Iewes, dissenting frō his Faith, yet claime a corporal descent from Abraham their father, nor doe the craftie Iesuits, dissenting frō their doctrine, yet claime a full consent vvith orthodox Antiquitie: accusing vs of Noveltie, as Christs ovvn doctrine, &amp; His Apostles, vvas before vs, that it may be seene true vvhich Sainct Peter fore-prophecied of such: to vvit, That in the latter times there should come false prophets,Marke 1.27. Acts 17.19. 2. Pet. 1.2. vvho privilie should bring in damnable heresies; and by reason of vvhome the vvaye of trueth shoulde bee evill spoken of.
            While as vve, notvvithstanding, adhere so to truest Antiquitie,
               
as that consenting vvith Tertullian,

from recent-broached perfidie, vnto the ancient Faith; from the madnesse of Noveltie, vnto sound Antiqultie; from the darknesse of Noveltie, vnto the ancient Light.
            Yet it is no marvell, that as vnder pretence of keeping the lavve made against blasphemers, our Head vvas condemned as a blasphemer, by that Iewish High priest;Iohn, 19.7. So vnder pretence of pleading for Antiquitie, the members be condemned by the Romane High priest, as violaters of Antiquitie. And as the Hagarenes called themselues Saracenes, so likevvise that vnder a name contrary to their nature, that Iesuitish crue, vvho seeme moste to procure for Antiquitie, practize moste against the same.
            This Pharisaicall brood being herein (as in other things) like

to their fore-fathers, of vvhom our Saviour 
                  •
               aith, Dicūt, sed non faciunt, They say, but doe not: So these men, (as Ioab did to Abner) they speake fairlie, but deale most foulie vvith venerable Antiquitie: 1. Rejecting Scripture (vvhich is most primitiue to vs, and Gods ovvne mouth) from being sole determiner in Gods ovvne cause; because it is indeed that breath of consumption to their man of sinne: and, like the Arke, it plagueth those Philistimes, and over-throvveth their Dagon. Next, vvhen they haue made their recourse frō divine Authoritie, to humane Testimonie, challenging those holie Fathers of the primitiue Church, as impudentlie to bee altogether on their side, as ever that Whoore challenged

               Athanasius, to be her associate in her filthie Whoordome. Yet notvvithstanding, vvhen they finde that vvherein they repose, so clearly and peremptorly to depose against them; no more disdainfully did ever the Iewes reject Christ, preferring to Him Barabbas, than they reject those Ancients, and their famous testimonies, preferring there-vnto the giddie Wine of their inebriating Errors: and regarding them only so farre as they seeme to make for them; as Elias sate no longer by Cherith, nor Ionas vnder the Gourd, than the one flovved, &amp; the other flovvrished.
            Yea, not only dismisse they them, vvith contempt, vvhen they make not for them; but as the envious man, after the husband-mans fielde vvas sovvne

vvith good seede, came craftily &amp; quietly there-after, &amp; mingled in his tares: So haue our Romanists sundry vvayes sophisticated the famous vvorks of the Lords Worthies, eyther by intermingling their language of Babel, vvith the language of Bethel; and so making their Books lyke a Lincie-vvoolsie Garment: or doing to their paines, as Hanun did to the persons of Davids Embassadours, cutting and curtayling them; or els altering their vvords, &amp; vvhere they vvould say Shibboleth, making to say Siboleth.
            
            And as Paul vvas accused, for bringing in Strangers and Grecians in the Temple, to pollute the same; So most justly may they be accused, for vnjust in bringing of strangers (vvhich are Counterfeits, vnder the

name of Fathers) into the Church of GOD, vvith such fraudfull Forgerie, to corrupt craftily; and inventing vvittily, to circumvent vvickedly. And all this they doe for the Diana of the Papacie, and supporting of that glorious Whoore of their proude Monarchie; setting not only a Citie, vvith Demetrius, but the vvhole vvorld in vproare: for (as that silver smith sayd) by that Craft they haue their vvealth: &amp; if the Lords vvord prevaile, they see their Craft is in danger to be set at naught, and Dagon vvill surely dovvne before the Arke of GOD.
            The proofe and particularizing of vvhat is formerly spoken, both in their dealing vvith Fathers, Councels, and Histories, I haue summarily

hereafter digested, &amp; succinctly set dovvn, &amp; dedicate the same to Your Worships Name, as a most vvorthy Patrō &amp; Pattern of Vertue, sincere in the Truth, zealous against Errour, a Mirrour of Policie, a Map of Humanitie, an Honour to Your Name, an Ornament to Your Countrey, &amp; a sole Moecenas of Letters amongst Your Equals in this respectlesse and clayie Age: vvhose Name, therefore, justly the Penns of the painful shal perpetuate, propagat your Fame, &amp; cōtinue your memorie.

               Your Worships in all respectiue duetie, W. GVILD.
               
            
         
         
            
            To the Reader.
            
               AS the Iewish People adorned the Burials of the ancient Prophets, as honourers of their memories; but in the meane time rejected that Great Prophet fore-tolde by them, and persecuted their successors: or, as that Romane Band; who crucified our Head, howsoever by wordes of salutation they seemed to giue Him honour &amp; courtesie; yet they shew by their deeds they meant disgrace and crueltie. Even so the Romish brood of that

lamed souldior, howsoever by words they would seeme to pleade for Antiquitie, yet their practises doe proclaime, that they are the defacers &amp; defamers thereof in veritie. So that amongst them, (as Lyrinensis saith) Dum pro coelesti dogmate humanae superstitiones introducuntur, bene fundata antiquitas scelesta novitate subruitur, &amp; nova cōtagio non tantū portiunculam, sed totam pariter Ecclesiam invasit: that is, While as humane superstitions are broght in for an heavenly point of Faith, well grounded Antiquitie is overthrowne by wicked Noveltie; and a new contagion hath broken in, not vpon a little part, but vpon the whole Church alyke.
            As the Ephesians therefore tumultuously cried out,
                  Acts 19.
                
               Great is Diana of Ephesus; so howsoever they in like manner crye, and appeale (as Paul did to Caesar) to Antiquitie, to Fathers and Doctors of the primitiue Church; yet when they

are brought thither whither they haue appealed, they are seene evidentlie as much to reject their orthodox doctrine, as ever the Ievves did the Prophets, whose Tombes they were decoring; and as much to abuse them in their holie pains, as ever their truest successours were in their harmlesse persons;
                  Genesis 38. and (like Iudah to Tamar) to be most guiltie themselues of what they vp-braide to others; straining out the Gnat, but swallowing the Camell.
            Yea, as Salomō
                judged between the two Women, which of them was the mother of the living child; or as Saul confessed of David,
               1. Samuel 24. that hee was more righteous than he: So everie judicious discerner may easilie here-by perceiue, which of vs more righteouslie, or reverentlie dealeth with Antiquitie: for (beside the particulars ensuing in this Treatise) they thinke it no fault to appeale frō

                        4. Howe them-selues haue formerlie corrupted those Recordes

            CHAPTER I. Of Antiquitie, and the severall sorts there-of.
            
               1. OF SCRIPTURE.
               
                  AGe is a Crovvne of Glorie, (sayeth the Wyse) when it is found in the way of Righteousnesse: and, Aske for the olde way, which is the good waye, is a wholesome counsell: For if we speake of ANTIQUITIE in the Superlatiue, wee may positiuelie affirme, Quod Antiquissimum est, est verissimum; &amp; quod

verissimum est, est tutissimum: That that which is most ancient, is truest; and that which is moste true, is moste sure. Therefore, Gods affirmatiue Trueth to Eva
                        •
                     , was prior to Satans negatiue Lie, Non moriemini, Yee shall not die: And therefore ever since, after the Beraeans exemple, To the Law, and to the Testimonie, hath beene the soundest directorie. Neyther must rash credulitie (as that of the young Prophets) against the warrand which wee haue out of Gods owne mouth,1. Kings 13. induce vs, so to hearken to Gray hairs, as they anie way seduce vs. Neyther was it a sufficient warrand for the Pharisaicall doctrine in our Saviours tyme, that it was sayd of olde: but the true Touch-stone, where-to wee are taught to reduce each thing for reformation, is to that, Quod fuit ab initio, which was from the beginning. Divine Institution being onelie lyke the First-borne, to whom, as Primacie in order, so Supremacie of authoritie, as the excellencie of Dignitie, and prerogatiue

of Strength is sole and onelie competent.
               This is that which Peter calleth the moste sure worde; which as it came from Heaven by inspiration, &amp; leadeth to Heaven by direction: so hath it ever beene guarded by Heaven, by powerfull protection. And as by it the manner of Gods worship, as by a patterne, hath bene formed and prepared: so haue the aberrations there-frae, and decay there-of,2. Chron. 31.21.35. beene ever reformed, and repared.
               This is the Christians Non ultra, No further; whose comprehension &amp; Consummatum, Accomplishment, (as it is in Scripture,) So doeth the Soule solie borrow light, (as the Moone from the Sunne,) and onelie from Scripture: Gods word there-in onlie resounding, His enlightning beams there-in onelie shyning, His will being there-in fullie revealed, and His whole counsell clearlie detected. So that as the sole rule of Religion wee doe embrace it, and as

the perfect patterne on the Mount we doe proclaime it: although our Adversaries would seeme to supply a def
                     •
                  ct there-in, partlie by Apocryphall Writings, against all Antiquitie, and partlie by sophisticating the sound sense there-of, with vnwritten veritie: the glorious light where-of they woulde lyke-wyse obfuscate, with an vnknowne tongue, against all authoritie, and the comfortable knowledge wherof, by an impious prohibition they with-holde from their Laitie.
            
            
               
                  2. Of Councels and Fathers.
               NExt vnto Sacred Scripture, wee reverence Councels,
                  
                     Bell. lib. 1. de Concil. cap. 5. in fine.
                   and Fathers of the primitiue Church: and therefore Bellarmine granteth, that we receiue the first sixe Councels: which we account as Subjects at the right hand (lyke Bathsheba) beside the Throne, but will not place them in the Throne, (lyke Salomon himselfe) giving the Priviledge of 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                  
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   not vnto them, but to their GOD and ours.Iohn 4.42. And as the Samaritanes, believing them not so much because they sayde it, as that we find their speach, lyke the Womans, agree with Christes wordes: and therefore take not their sentences as a Law, but as they homologate with the Law,Isai 8.22. and are tryed by the Testimonie.
               How-so-ever then wee account them Fathers to vs, yet wee esteeme them sonnes and subjectes to the Trueth it selfe: and that wee are no further bound to follow them, than Paul willed the Corinthians to be followers of him:1. Cor. 11.1. And therefore, as Orpah left Naomi,
                  Ruth 1. when she left Midian: or as Augustine left Cyprian before him, when hee, and a whole Councell, left Scripture, concerning Re-baptizing. So we may leaue them lawfullie, when they leaue the Trueth erringlie, else, why are not the Papists them-selues Millenaries, Quae opinio,
                  
                     Bell. lib. 3 de Pont. cap. 17. §. hac.
                   
                  fuit multorum Veterum, Which was the opinion of many of the Ancients, sayeth their Grand Bellarmine.
               
               
                  Wee may not, therefore, sacrifice to the paynes of Man, what is due onelie to the pen of the Spirit: nor as if gods had come downe, in the shape of men, as the people of Lystra thought Paul and Barnabas, dare we giue to them that supreame honour of absolute beliefe, as to the mouth of God: but must with saint Ierome distinguish wyselie of the persons, and with saint Augustine discerne warilie of their payns: Ierome saying of the one, Scio me aliter habere Apostolos,
                  
                     Hieron. epist. 62 cap. 2. 
                  aliter reliquos tractatores, illos semper vera dicere, istos in quibusdam ut homines aberrare: I know I respect the Apostles one way, and other entreaters of matters another: the one, as those that ever speak truth; the others, as men in some things subject to errour. And Augustine saying of the other,
                     August. de beno pers
                           •
                        v. c. 2. 
                  Neminem velim sic amplecti omnia mea, ut me sequatur, nisi in iis, in quibus me non errare perspexerit, I would haue no man so to embrace all my writings and sayings, that he should follow mee, but in those things in which he knoweth well that I am free from errour. So that they them-selues subject their worke to the fyerie tryall of the Spirit, their building to the measuring

Reede of the Temple; their speach, to the Law and Testimonie; their Coyne, to the Ballance of the Sanctuarie; and tho never so skilfull for the worke of the LORDS Tabernacle, like Bezaleel &amp; Aholiab, yet must their cunning bee lyable to the canon of Scripture, and their labours levelled according to that patterne, whereby no more indignitie is done so, to their venerable persons, nor worthie paines, and happie memories,Iohn 5.39. than CHRIST wished to be done to his heavenlie Speaches; or the Baereans did to the Apostles Preachings. And in a word, Reserving to GOD, and sacred inspyred Scripture, their prerogatiue royall, wee protest, that wee afford as much authoritie, as Pietie will permit, Reason require, Equitie admit, or themselues doe desire. So farre are wee from vilifying Antiquitie, disdaining the Fathers, contemning of Councels, or rejecting their Authorities, as most impiouslie we are belied, and more

impudentlie slandered, by those who are of alike temper in their Faces,Daniel, 2. as Nebuchadnezar's Image was in his yron legs, being suteable of a whorish fore-head, that cannot bee ashamed, who are the supporters of that Whoore of Babylon.

               3. Of Historie.
               ANd as for Histories, the Vnfolder of Prophecie, the Light of Times, the Lyfe of Memorie, the Eternizer of Actions, the Glasse of Sufferings, &amp; Detecter of Trueth, wee admit the same more than our Adversaries, &amp; dimit them as probable Witnesses, with farre lesse Injurie:

                        •
                     es were impared. of the 900. yeare of GOD, that in that most wicked time, and in the Papall Seat, both Pietie and Veritie was altogether decayed: and Platina to say, Quod eo tum Pontificatus devenerat ut qui plus largitione &amp; ambitione valeret, is tantummodo dignitatis gradum bonis oppressis &amp; rejectis obtineret: that is, that at that time the Popedome came to that passe, that hee who was able to doe most by bryberie and ambition, good men being borne downe and rejected, did onlie obtaine the place of honour.
               Thus is made plaine the falling of that Starre from Heaven,Revelation, 9. to whome was given, the Key of the bottomlesse Pit: Thus did that Beast rise out of the Earth, horned like the Lambe, but speaking lyke

the Dragon, and aspire both to such matchlesse power, and pompous pryde: Thus began that Whoore to sit on manie Waters, and that Mother of Harlots to make the Earth drunke, with the Wine of her Fornications, beeing drunke her selfe with the Blood of the Saincts.
               Thus out of cleare Storie we see, how what budded both in Demas and Diotrephes, had its perfection in the Apex of the Papacie; never ceasing, till that which before was a preaching Church, became thereafter a pompous Court: and those whose Predecessours were made Martyres, became themselues, by cruell massacring, Martyr-makers. So that as in the first period of the Church, there was trueth and patient suffering, (against Satans force) with holie simplicitie; and in the second there was learned and pithie wrestling (against Satans fraud) by errour and Heresie: So in the third poysonable corruption,

entred in the Romane Church by Pelfe and Pryde, Mammon and Monarchie: till at last Sodomiticall ease and fulnesse of Bread, bred tyrannous securitie: which being joyned with Craftinesse and obstinacie, doth now with bloodie crueltie and impudencie, fill vp the Cup, and summe vp the Mysterie.
               All which is made manifest by their owne Friends and Favourers, who, howsoever they be the brood of their Bowels, yet like Vipers, who discover the bowels of their venomous Mother; so these declare the lamentable decay of the light of religious Trueth, vnder the cloud of Papacie; and the worlds dolefull declyning, to that palpable and mistie darknesse of ignorance and Apostacie. They likewise detect the Schismes and Simonies of the Romane Church, the pride and prevailing of that Apostaticke Synagogue, the craft and crueltie of that brutish Beast, the licentious luxurie of that lustfull Harlot, the

cloaked hypocrisie of that false Prophet, with the damnable entries, desperate liues, &amp; dreadfull deathes of those men of Sinne: Sometimes a Whoore possessing the Seate of that Whoore of Babylon, as wee reade of Pope Ioane: Sometimes a Whoore obtaining that Seate to her filthie Whoore-master, as wee reade of Theodora, advancing Iohn X. Sometimes the Whoorish Bastard of a Pope, and a Whoore sitting therein, as Iohn XI. procreated betweene Sergius III. and Marozia, Meretrix famosissima, a most notorious Whoore, (sayeth Onuphrius.) Sometimes by Monsters for filthinesse, and all sort of Vice, as Iohn XII. Steven VII. Sylvester III. Bennet IX. Sometimes entring by pactiō with the Devill, as Sylvester II. Sometimes by Simonie, or violent intrusion, as wee see was common, by Histories consent:

               Hence it was, that all adoration of Images, what-so-ever, was condemned as Idolatrous, both in the East, in that famous Councell of Constantinople, of 338 ancient Bisshops, conveaned in the yeare of God 754; as also in the West, in that famous Councell of Frankford, vnder Charles the Great, holden by the Fathers and Bishops of Italie, France, and Germanie, in the yeare of God 794.
               And vvhat vvas the Doctrine vvhich the verie papall Sea it selfe

did hold in the 600 yeare of Christ before that,
                     Greg. lib. 9. epist. 9. let Pope Gregorie his Letter to Serenus, Bishop of Marsils, testifie; vvilling him, how-so-ever Images were to bee tollerated for instruction, to bee in Churches, yet that hee should suffer them by no means to be adored, or anie wise worshipped. The Reason where-of hee giveth, is this, Quia omne manufactum adorare non licet, quoniam scriptum est, Dominum Deum tuum adorabis, &amp; Ipsi soli servies: that is, Because it is not lawfull to worship anie thing that is made with hands, in respect it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord, thy God, &amp; Him onlie shalt thou serue. Where we see Dulia, or religious service, which is the most inferiour sort of popish worship, forbidden to Images, by a Pope him selfe.

The reasō was, because the ancient Christians had no Images in their Churches. Of whome when it was demanded by the Gentiles, why they had no Images? Minutius Foelix gaue them this answere,

               Yea, such was the more carefull warinesse yet, of the ancient Fathers, to prevent Idolatry, that they would not haue the Images of God nor His Saincts, so much as set vp in private houses.

which is Latria, is due to anie Image of Christ. And that this is not the doctrine of the forenamed, or of a few, but the constant doctrine of Romane divinitie, thus testifieth Azorius the Iesuit,

                  Canus doeth giue, Quippe cum Sanctorum omnium sensus, Spiritus sancti sensus ipse sit: that is, To wit, Seeing the meaning of all the holie Fathers, is the meaning of the holy Ghost him selfe (sayeth hee.)
               And yet, what the Popish practise

is heere in, let vs by a few Examples beholde.
               First, in the interpretation of that place, Rom. 5.12. In whom al ha
                        ••
                      sinned, the whole Aūncientes, vvith one mouth,
                     Can. loc. Theol. lib. 7. cap. 1. num. 1. 
                        •
                     . Sancti.
                   (sayeth Canus) affirme the blessed Virgine, to haue beene conceived in Originall sinne and so all agree, that by the word [All] the whole race of Adam
                  ▪ are included, that ever were procreated betweene Man and Woman. But the Romanists will no-wyse acqulesse to this exposition, because they vvill haue the Virgin Maries conception without originall sinne; and 
                     •
                  o, contrarie to the exposition o
                     •
                   all the Fathers, will haue her excluded.
               Where also it is to be noted, that seeing no Graduate in Divinitie is promoted in Paris, without giving a solemne Oath, to mayntayne this Priviledge of the Virgine Marie: and that this Text, and exposition there-of, is close contrarie there-to, as also to that Ordinance of their

owne Councell, for exposition of Scripture, according to the vniforme consent of Fathers. Therefore it will clearly follow, that they sweare both to impugne Scripture, Veritie, as also consenting Antiquitie, together with their Popes and his Councells authoritie.
               
                  Stella in lyke manner, expounding the 21 verse of the 10 chapter of Luke, saith, All the Expounders, whom I could commonlie see, eyther of ancient holie Doctors, or of recent Divines, all these, and their Commentaries, declare▪ that the word confite
                     •
                  or, is not taken heere for Confession of sinnes▪ but for that (sayeth hee) which wee call Thanks-giving, Commending, or to blesse, &amp;c. Notwithstanding this meaning of the
                        ••
                     s can neyther agree with the wordes, nor could it ever satisfie anie-wyse my mynde.
               
               Agayne, Maldonat, commenting on Matthew 26, 29, where our Saviour sayeth, I will not drinke hencefoorth of the fruite of the Vine, sayeth thus, Origen, Cyprian, Chrysostome, Epiphanius, Ierome, Augustine, Beda, Euthymius,

and Theophilast; all these referre those wordes to Christ's blood, (or that which was so called in the Sacrament:) but I cannot be perswaded, (sayeth hee) that they can bee referred to the Blood of Christ. Because he (forsooth) would haue them vnderstood of the common Cuppe, before the institution of the Sacrament, to avoyde the force of this Testimonie agaynst Transsubstantiation.
               In lyke manner, expounding these wordes for Papall Supremacie▪ 
                  Thou art Peter,
                  
                     Maldon. in Matth. 16.18. 
                  and vpon this Rocke I will build My Church, hee sayth thus of the interpretation of Fathers, expounding the Rocke, not to be Peter, but Christ Him selfe, or that Confession of Fayth, which was made of Christ. This meaning (sayeth he) of these words, seemes not to me to be the true meaning, which all other Fathers thinke to be so, whom ever I remember to haue read, except onlie Hilarie.
               
               Also, for mayntaynance of the same Supremacie, commenting on the subsequent Verse, Neyther will I

interpret (sayeth hee) that this which is spoken heere to Peter, is spoken also in the same sense to the other Apostles, Whatsoever thou loosest on earth, shall be loosed in Heaven, altho I see all Interpreters, except Origen onelie, to bee of that mynde.
               
               More-over, commenting on Matth. 11, 13, which speaketh of Elias that was to come, meaning Iohn the Baptist, hee sayeth, Almost all the Fathers so expound that place, but this their exposition is not fit enough. And why? But because the Iesuit would haue Elias yet only to come, in the reigne and time of their conceited Antichrist.
               
               Last of all,
                     Maldon. in Matth. 19.11. expounding these words of Matthew, All men cannot receiue this Saying; after that he hath adduced the interpretation of the Fathers thereon, to be this, Non omnes praestare possunt, ut sint sine uxore, quia carent dono continentiae: that is, All men cannot attayne to this, that they may be without a wyfe because they want the gift of chastitie; hee concludeth,

                  Sic fere omnes exponunt, quibus equidem ego non assentior: that is, Indeede almost all Interpreters so expound, with whome not-withstanding I doe not agree. And why? But because hee is a Pleader agaynst this Text, and the exposition of Antiquitie, for forced single lyfe, and the Vow of Continencie.
               Agayne, in the exposition of the last Commandement,
                     Bell. lib. 2. de Imag. c. 7. § perre.
                   when Bellarmine hath adduced a number of Fathers, holding that Commandement, Thou shalt not covet, &amp;c. to be but one entire Commandemēt, and not divisible in two, as the Papists make it, to make vp ten, confounding the first and second; for defence of their Imagerie, hee rejecteth al their judgements, as grosse and erronious.
               
                  
                     Bell. lib. 1. de purg. c. 6.In lyke manner, when he hath adduced the expositions of all the Fathers, which they giue on that place of the Corinthians (1. Cor. 15.29.) where-by hee would establish Purgatorie, because they serue not for his purpose, hee roundlie therefore

rejecteth them all, calling them haske, and both false and forced; and therefore taketh one of later Forgerie, more suteable to his mynde.
               Agayne,
                     Tolet. in Ioh. 7. a
                           •••
                        t. 23. when Cardinall Tolet, in the exposition of Iohn 7, 37, hath adduced Chrysostome, Euthymius, and Theophilact, their agreement in one, yet this is his censure, saying, that their exposition is both forced and vnfit: and therefore hee professeth not to follow it anie way.
               Last of all,
                     Cajet. pref. in Pentateuch.
                   thus sayeth Cardinall Cajetan, of the exposition of Scripture in generall, Let no man abhorre (sayth hee) any new sense of Scripture for this cause, because it disagreeth frō the ancient Doctors: but let him search more nearlie the Text, and coherence of Scripture: and if hee finde agreement, let him prayse God, who hath not tyed the exposition of Scripture, to the meaninges of ancient Doctors, but to the integritie of Scripture it selfe.
               
               How-so-ever then Bellarmine braggeth of their syde, that they

follow the consent of Fathers,

                   falselie imputing to vs, that wee onelie followe our owne exposition; yet wee see heere-in, that it may bee justlie sayde vnto them, that of the Poet, Mutato nomine de te, fabula narretur. Their owne Cardinall Baronius,
                  
                     Baron. annal. tom. 1. ad ann. 34. num. marg. 213. (besyde their fore-named practise) confessing clearlie, that al-be-it the holie Fathers, whom we (sayeth he) for their heavenlie learning, worthilie doe call, The Doctors of the Church, were evidentlie endewed beyond others, with the grace of the holie Ghost, yet in the exposition of Scripture, the Catholicke (that is, the Romane) Church, doeth not ever, and in all thinges, follow them.
               
            
         
         
            
            CHAP. IIII. How contumeliouslie they deale with the Fathers, and especiallie, first, with those of the Greeke Church, conjunctlie, and in Councell.
            
               
                  IT is reported of Pelagius, that even when he most disagreed from the Orthodox Fathers of the Primitiue Church, yet in his third Booke for Free-will, hee soothed vp his Heresie, and thought to amaze all men with his prayse of Sainct Ambrose; Blessed Sainct Ambrose, that Bishop (sayeth he) in whose bookes the Romane Fayth especiallie appeareth, who lyke a beautifull Flowre, shyned amongst the Latine Wryters, and whose Fayth, and most pure vnderstanding of

the Scriptures, the verie Enemie himselfe dare not reprehende. Even so, our Adversaries, when they most disagree lyke-wyse from the most ancient Fathers, and primitiue Councels, yet how they doe soothe vp their Errours? But with the lyke Salue: alleadging the holie Fathers, and famous Councels of the primitiue Church, al-to-gether to make for them; and therefore they highlie extoll and advance them. But as Ambrose not-with-standing made agaynst his Prayser Pelagius, So doe the Fathers and Councels make close agaynst the Romanistes: and then, how they turne their Osanna, to Crucifie; their Praysing, to Depressing; and their High Valuing, to Low Vilifying, let their owne Mouth, and these Examples, verifie.
               Their ancient Pope Gregorie declareth,

                        •
                     . that hee reverenced the foure first Councels, as the verie foure Gospels; holding firmlie, that they only stood for Trueth, and only with-stood Errour: and yet, what

is it that Bellarmine accuseth the verie second of these Councels of? Even the standing for, &amp; decreeing of a most grosse Heresie, and the with-standing of such a necessarie Trueth, which by the definition of Pope Boniface the eight,
                     Extran. lib. 1. tit. 8. de major &amp; obed. c. vnam sanctam.
                   is of such importance to belieue, that by him who holdeth not the same, there is no salvation to bee expected, because hee is without the Church. And this great Poynt is the Pope's Supremacie.
               
                  Bellarmine's owne wordes then are these,
                     Bellar. pr

                  The first (sayeth hee) who most earnestlie with-stood the Supremacie of the Bishop of Rome, seemeth to be the Grecian Fathers: for they, since the yeare of God 
                  
                     •
                  81, would haue the Bishop of Constantinople, (who before was not a Patriarch at all) preferred notwithstanding to the three Patriarches of the East, and in the second roome, next the Bishop of Rome. And this may bee vnderstoode (sayeth hee) by the second Generall Councell. Wher-vnto he might haue joyned like-wise the sixt Canon of

the first Nyce
                        •
                     
                   Councell, no lesse peremptor against the fore-saide Supremacie.
               Where it is to be noted, that Papall Supremacie, which the Greeke Orthodox Church never would admit, can no-wise therefore bee called (as the Papists tearme it) a Catholicke point of Doctrine: as also if the Pope cannot erre, ex Cathedra, it will follow, according to Boniface fore-said definition, that all the Greeke Fathers are absolutelie damned.
               Next, hee spareth not to blotte those holie Fathers, of that fourth and famous Councell of Chalcedon,
                  Bel. ibidem. both with Fraud and Deceit, in the fore-named point, saying, Thereafter, in the yeare 451, the Greeke Fathers (sayth he) not being content with their former Determination, they preassed to make the Bishop of Constantinople equall alway to the Bishop of Rome: for in the Councell of Chalcedon, in the sixteenth Act thereof, the Grecian Fathers decreed, (but not without deceit (sayeth hee)

                  and the Romane Legates beeing absent,) that the Bishop of Constantinople should bee so in the second Roome, after the Bishop of Rome: that notwithstanding thereof, bee should haue the same equall Priviledges, as the other had.
               
               Now, if anie grosser Imputations can bee layde vpon anie, than hee doeth vpon these holie Fathers, and famous Councels, let any man consider; making them hereticall in Mind and Opinion, and false or fraudulent in Manners and Action▪
               
               Yea, what farther falsehood and fraude hee layeth to the charge of that famous &amp; Orientall Church, in corrupting the works of others,
                     Bell. lib. 4. de pont. c. 11. §. ad secundum, &amp; sect. secundo. Item, lib. 2. de Christo, c. 23. se

                        . Graci.
                   let his owne wordes testifie. For it was the ordinarie Custome of the Grecians, (sayeth hee) to corrupt the Bookes of other men. Where-of hee cleareth the Occidentall, or Latine Church, by a reason to be laughed at, for the palpable evidence of the contrarie, (as shall bee showne) saying, Quoniam Romani sicut non accumina, it a nec impostur as habent: That

is, Because the Romanes, as they haue no sharpnesse of wit, so they cannot vse deceit, (sayth he:) while as all men know, &amp; experience hath taught, that there are none that haue beene more subtill, nor sharper witted than they.
            
            
               Secondlie, how they deale with the Greeke Fathers, severallie and a-part.
               FIrst, when Chrysostome is adduced for peoples reading of Scripture,
                     Bell. lib. 1. de verbo, cap. vlt. §. respondeo verbo.
                   
                  Bellarmine answereth, That continuallie hee exhorted all men (sayeth hee) to reade the Scriptures: Non quod vellet omnes rudissimos id facere: That is, But not, that hee would had all men, altho never so vnlearned, so to doe. And so hee imputeth to this holie Father, that hee spake farre other-wise, than hee meant; and dissimulatelie required that to bee done, which hee would not haue done in earnest.
               Next, when wee vrge Ireneus testimonie (for proving the Pope to

bee Antichrist) that the number of the name of the Beast most fitlie is Lateinus, (according to the olde forme of pronouncing, as Lipsius witnesseth) thereby showing,
                     Lipsius de antiq. pronun. cap. 8. that hee was to bee a Latine Bishop, having his Seate in the Latine Church: and more particularlie, in Latium, or Italie, his Decrees also in Latine, and all publicke Service in these Churches, subject to him in Latine like-wise. Vnto this Testimonie of Ireneus, Bellarmine answereth thus,
                     Bell. lib. 3. de pont. cap. 10. sect. has opinio.
                   
                  Conjectura illa Irenei (sayth he) quae tunc aliqua fuit, nunc nulla est: That is, That light conjecture of Ireneus, which was some-what in his dayes, is of no account with vs now: As if such Varlets were best Valuers, or Trueth changed with Time, and Veritie ran on the Wheeles of vnconstant Varietie.
               Agayne, when Saynct Cyprian is opposed agaynst Traditions,
                     Bell. lib. 4. de verbo c. 11. sect. profert. 12. Bell. lib. 2. de sacr. cap. 30. sect. 4. 
                  Bellarmine answereth, that Cyprian wrote so (sayeth hee) when hee would defend his Errour, (which hee calleth elsewhere

the Heresie of Anabaptisme) and therefore it is no marvell, that he reason after the manner of Heretickes. By which answere, hee condemneth not onlie Saynct Cyprian, but Augustine lyke-wyse, who in this poynt, of requyring recourse to bee had onlie vnto holie Scripture, greatlie commended Saynct Cyprian.
               
               Lyke-wyse, when Theodoret is objected agaynst Transsubstantiation, witnessing in his second Dialogue, called, Inconfusus, That after Consecration, the Elements remayne still in their former substance; Valentia answereth,
                     Valen. lib. de transsub. c. 7. sect. 11. saying, That some of the Ancients in this Matter, neyther thought nor wrote truely, nor consideratelie, as they ought. Or hee might haue added, At least, as the Iesuits now would haue had them.
               In lyke manner, when Chrysostome is produced to proue, that the Virgine Marie had originall sinne, because shee sinned actuallie, when Christ rebuked her at the Marriage of Cana in Galile;

               More-over, when Ignatius, a Greeke Father, is opponed agaynst the mutilation of the Sacrament,

               Now, to resume: if with imputations onelie of double Dissimulation, conjecturall Lenitie, damnable Heresie, rash Inconsideratenesse, seducing Errour, and such lyke, wee should thus aunswere the Testimonies of Fathers, consenting clearlie with Scripture; affirming them vnworthie of Christian approbation, of honest mens trust, wyse mens regard, or Fatherlie Authoritie; what clamours of Indignitie, done to Antiquitie, should wee heare of our opposed Partie? forgetting that Precept of Equitie, Quod tibi fieri non vis, alterine feceris.

                  Can. loe. theol. lib. 7. cap. 3. num. 7. 
               The canonick Authors (sayth he) as they are supream, heavenlie, and divine; so they keepe a perpetuall and firmè constancie of trueth; but other holie Wryters being inferiour, and humane, they erre some-times, yea, and bring foorth Monsters, against the convenient order, and ordinarie course of Nature.
               
                  Alph. l. 1. adv. heres. c. 7. So doth Alphonsus de Castro, declare, that they are oftentimes found cōtradictorie to themselues, (saith he:) the particular examples where-of Iansenius,
               
                  Ians. concord. Evang. c. 137. p. 541. &amp; cap. 146. p. 624. in his Concordance of the Evangels, hath laboured

to show, in Ierome, Ambrose, and Augustine.
            
            Like-wise, with levitie and inconstancie, thus doeth both Bellarmine and Alphonsus brand holie S. Ierome, who when hee is objected vnto them against their Pompaticall and Papall Hierarchie, alleadging no difference to bee in Scripture, betweene a Bishop, and a Presbyter,
                  Bell. lib. 1. de cler. c. 15. sect. est antem.
                
               Bellarmine answereth, Est autem observandum Hieronymum in h
                     •
                  c sententia, non adeo constantem videri: That is, It is to bee observed, (sayeth hee) that Ierome in this point seemeth not to bee so constant, as hee should bee.
            
            
               
                  Alph. l. 6. adv. heres. tit. Episcopus.
               The like sayeth Alphonsus, in these wordes, Ex quibus verbis apparet B. Hieronymum sibi ipsi in hac parte minime constare: That is, By which words it is evident, that S. Ierome was no wise constant in this point.
            
            Yea, more-over, when Ierome is produced, consenting with a number of Fathers, whom their Medina nominateth, to prooue the same point, that primitiuelie a Bishop

and Presbyter were all one,
                  Bell. lib. 1. de pont. c. 8. §. respondeo.
                
               Bellarmine answereth grossely, giving him the Lie, saying, Videtur revera Hieronymum in ea opinione fuisse, quae falsa est: That is, It appeareth indeede, that Ierome was of that opinion, but yet the same is false.
            
            After the same manner doeth Pigbius also vse Augustine,
               
                  Pigh. de orig. pecc.
                whose doctrine when hee hath brought, in two pointes, concerning originall sinne, (agreeable to Scripture) yet thus he speaketh thereof, Quae Augustini sententia [sayth hee] non solum incerta, sed &amp; falsa est: That is, Which doctrine of Augustine's, is not onlie vncertaine, but lyke-wyse vntrue, or false.
            
            Yea, little lesse vnreverentlie doth Bellarmine vse one of their own Popes, to wit, Pius the secōd, whose testimony when we oppose against Papall Supremacie, proving, that no such thing was knowne, nor acknowledged, in the primitiue Church; the fore-saide Pope testifying, Quod ante Nicenam Synodum

parum respectus habebatur ad Romanam Ecclesiam: That is, That little regard was had to the Romane Church, before the Councell of Nice: Bellarmine thus answereth, Quae sententia (sayth he) partim non est vera: That is, Which declaration of his heere-in, is in a part false and vntrue.
            
            Agayne, when Tertullian is produced agaynst the Pope's infallibilitie,

                proving Pope Zepherin to haue beene a Montanist, Bellarmine answereth roundlie, That Tertullian is a Liar, saying, Non est omnino Tertulliano hac in parte fides adhibenda: that is, In that matter there is no credit at all to bee given to Tertullian.

            And agayne,

                when he is produced agaynst Transsubstantiation, showing, that Christ's wordes, saying, I will not drinke hence-foorth of the fruit of the Vine, were spoken of the consecrated Cup, Bellarmine answereth, Augustinum non expendisse hunc locum diligenter: that is, that Augustine did not weigh or consider this place diligentlie: to wit, not so friendlie for the Pope's behoofe, and his Darling of Transsubstantiation, which was hatched after.
            In lyke manner,
                  Bell. lib. 1. de purg. c. 5. sect. quarta diff.
                when the foresayde Augustine, and Pope Gregorie's expositions, on 1 Cor. 3, 13, are adduced, showing, by that Fyre which is spoken of there, are meaned the Troubles of this lyfe, and no other

Fyre of Purgatorie, Bellarmine summarilie goeth to worke, and sayth, Sed hoc jam rejecimus: that is, But as for this exposition of theirs, (sayth hee) wee haue alreadie rejected it.
            
            And when hee hath showne, how many ancient and famous Authors haue vehementlie oppugned their ydle begging Orders,
                  Bell. lib. 2. de mon. c. 45. yet he answereth, At

            Yea, more-over, when both a Romane Councell,
                  Bell. lib. 2. de mon. c. 35. §. at his. Greg. l. 3. Ep. 11. 1 Tim. 5.9. and a Romane Pope, are produced, forbidding the vayling of Nunnes, before 60 years of age, according to that Apostolicall Precept, of receiving of Widowes, Bellarmine there-vnto answereth, His non obstantibus licere in quacunque aetate, si adsit usus liberi arbi
                  
                     •
                  rii, talia vota nuncupare: that is, Notwith-standing of all that is alleadged,
               
(to wit, out of Scripture, Councels, or Fathers) it is lawfull (sayeth hee) of what age so-ever they bee, (provyding that they haue the vse of Free-will) to vnder-goe such Vowes.
            
            I omit, how hee answereth the Authorities of other Fathers, onlie with imputation of Ignorance, and want of Learning vnto them, when they are objected; as where hee sayeth,
                  Bell. lib. 1. de Christo, c. 6. §. at contra.
                
               Procopius was a better Orator, than a Divine, (sayeth hee:) Lactantius also was better seene in Cicero's Bookes,
                  Bell. lib. 1. de sanct. c. 5. sect. habenius.
                than hee was in the Scriptures: and Victorius was indeed (sayeth hee) a Martyr, but he wanted Learning.
            To conclude, therefore; if with baser Money anie can bee payed, who exacteth Satisfaction to the Testimonies of Fathers, than you see by our Adversaries layde down heere, let anie one judge: Or if Imputations to those Auncientes, of Monstrous Births, crosse Contradictions, grosse Errour, light Inconstancie, base Lying, vilde Slandering,

blynde Ignorance, carelesse Neglect, with vndeserved Distrusting them, and open Rejection, can passe for currant, eyther on their bare word, to satisfie vs, or to expresse their so much pretended, and bragged of reverence to venerable Antiquitie, then let Light and Darknesse, and GOD and Beliall be agreed, or as the Poet sayth,

Now vvhen I had come to salute this Man, it fell out by chance▪ or rather by the singular providence of GOD, that I found him busied in revising over the Workes of S. Ambrose, vvhich then Frelonius vvas printing: and after much talke hither and to, vvhen I shewed him, that I vvould no longer bee a vvith-drawer of him from his work, hee having begun againe the reading over of one Page, saide to mee, See yee not the manner of this our Edition of S. Ambrose, how prettie and perfect it is? and to looke vpon it, is vvorthie to bee preferred before anie Edition that ever hitherto came out. And after I had behelde, and praysed the finenesse of the Edition, hee saide then vnto mee, But if I vvere to buy anie Copie of S. Ambrose Workes, I vvould buy anie other Copie vvhat-so-ever, before I bought this vvhich thou seest.

               First, Examples of Popish adding to the Fathers.
               FIrst, of adding to the Fathers, and their Decrees, being conveaned

in Councell, wee haue a notable evidence, in that impudent and audacious fact of Pope Zozimus, who added a Canon in his owne behalfe, to the verie first Councell of Nice; which by that famous sixt Councel of Carthage was, as a notable Forgerie, detected, and declared, and could never hitherto, by all the croaking Frogges of that Iesuiticall Crew,See Bell. l. 2 de pon

               Againe, in the matter of appeals, where-as the Councel of Milevi decreed,
                     Concil. Milev. c. 22. vnder paine of Excommunication, That none with-in Africke should appeale to any part beyond Sea: Bellarmine is forced to grant a forged addition,

                   in favours of the Pope, to haue beene there-after grosselie by Gratian added to the Canon, saying, Addidit ad hunc Canonem exceptionem, nisi forte ad Apostolicam sedem appelletur, sed haec exceptio non videtur quadrare (sayth hee) nam praecipue propter Romanam Ecclesiam Africani statuerunt ut non liceret appellare

ultra mare: That is, Hee added to this Canon, this exception, to wit, Except perhaps the appeale bee made, vnto the Sea Apostolicke; but this exception (sayeth Bellarmine) seemeth not to agree with the Canon, for it was chiefelie for the Romane Churches cause, that it was decreed, to bee vnlawfull to anie, to appeale out of Africke, to anie part beyond Sea. Thus wee see for the Pope's advancement, and gratifying, how false, and trickie his Supposts haue beene of olde, even by our Adversaries owne confession clearlie.

                  Bellarmine answereth, Deceptum esse ex depravato codice, quem ipse babuit B. Augustini cui tribuit illum canonem, codices vero veri &amp; emendati B. Augustini non habent ut Gratianus refert: That is, Gratian (sayth hee) was deceived by a corrupt Copie of S. Augustine's, which

hee had beside him, to whom bee attributeth that Canon; but the true and mended Copies of S. Augustine since then, haue not these words as Gratian reporteth thē. How bolde then the Pope's Parasites haue beene with the works of the Fathers, in corrupting them, for supporting that Whoore of Babylon, wee may clearlie see, by this confession of Bellarmine's, &amp; others, who now in their latter and mended Copies, are forced, for shame, to haue razed out of their olde Copies, such grosse corruptions, and openlie to disclaime the same.

That is, Hee seemeth to command a great wickednesse; it is therefore a figure, will the Hereticke say, requyring vs onely to communicate with the Lord's Passion, and sweetly and profitably to lay vp in our memorie, that His flesh was crucified, and wounded for vs. Remarke then, how the publisher hath put in of his owne these wordes, dicet Haereticus into Augustine's Testimonie, cited

by the fore-saide Fulbertus; and by so doing, thinking to meete with the Hereticks of this time, (as hee calleth vs) was not a-ware, that hee made Augustine lyke-wyse an Hereticke for Companie, whose verie words these are, and no other mans, Lib. de doct. Christ. cap. 16.
               Like-wise, Gratian relating the second Councell of Cavaillon,

                   their words concerning Confession, setteth them downe thus, Quidam veve sacerdotibus confitenda esse percensent, ut tota fere sancta Ecclesia: That is, But some are of mynde, that our sinnes are to bee confessed vnto the Priest, as almost the whole holie Church thinketh. But that these wordes, ut tota fere sancta Ecclesia, are favourablie added for Popish Confession, to insinuate, that the same was a catholicke doctrine, and practise in the Church then, not onlie the preceeding wordes, comprehending the whole Greeke Church, their minde in the contrarie, verefieth, Qui Deo solummodo confiteri peccata dicunt, (saith

the Canon:) That is, Who sayth, that sinnes should bee confessed onelie to God: but also the Note vpon this place of their Canon Law, latelie published by Gregorie the 13, freelie granteth, that these words, ut tota fere sancta Ecclesia, are added, and are not neither in the Capitular, nor Councell.
               What forged and farsed Additions like-wise are everie-where through-out S. Cyprian's workes, put in by that impudent Patcher Pamelius, let that Edition of his of S. Cyprians workes, conferred with ancient Copies, as Gulartius hath verie well observed them, to all men testifie: one example where-of I will onelie instance, of the alleadgeance, of a testimonie of S. Cyrian's, of that Edition, adduced for the Pope's Supremacie, in a written Popish Pamphlet, sent of late to a Brother of our Presbyterie, to answere vnto; and which, for evidence of the trueth there-of, wee yet keepe beside vs, containing

foure grosse Additions, even in one onelie Testimonie, besides a most fraudfull Alteration, of most materiall words.

And Hee sayeth vnto him againe, after His Resurrection, Feed My Sheepe. And albeit after His Resurrection, (marke this) he gaue a-like power to all His Apostles, and said, As My Father sent Mee, so sende I you, receiue the holie Ghost: to whom ye forgiue sinnes, they shall be forgiven, &amp;c. Yet that Hee might manifest that vnitie should bee amongst them, by His authoritie, Hee disposed it so, that the beginning of this Vnitie should bee at one, yet were the rest of the Apostles the verie same, as was Peter, (remarke this againe) endued with alike fellowship, both of Honour &amp; Power:

                  but a beginning proceedeth from Vnitie, that it may bee showne, that Christ's Church is one.
               
               Thus we may see, that this Testimonie sincerelie cited, and considered, maketh no wayes for Peter's Supremacie of Iurisdiction over the rest of the Apostles, or the Pope's, (as his Successor, over all other Bishops) but is flat agaynst the same: seeing it is sayde, That the rest were the same, as hee was, and all had the a-lyke, or equall power, as hee had.
               But this fore-sayde Testimonie, as it is clowted and clamped, and by him who out of his Pamelius hath cited, and set downe the same with his owne hand, is thus, Loquitur Dominus ad Petrum, &amp;c. that is, The Lord speaketh thus to Peter (saith Cyprian) I say vnto thee (sayeth Christ) that thou art Peter, and vpon this Rock

               Thus haue they sowne in their Tares, in anothers Fielde: thus also haue they put in their Colloquintida, in the Pottes of the Lord's Prophets, and the Asse hath joyned to plow with the Oxe together. And by so doing, they haue made the workes of manie ancient and worthie Wryters, lyke Hermophrodites, which are hardlie knowne to which Sexe they inclyne most; joyning their newe Clowt, to the

               Secondlie, examples of Popish purging from the Fathers.
               AS in the former Examples we haue seene their illicite Lincie-wolsie mixture of Addition, So wee will show now, God willing, how these cunning Arithmeticians are as perfect in their manner of Substraction, and so cannot onelie decline in the Datiue, but as well in the Ablatiue Case: &amp; as Naash would haue pulled out the right Eyes of the men of Iabesh, so how they haue (Crow-lyke) picked out manie orthodox Speaches, out of the works of holie Fathers, that were most peremptor against them, making them Eunuches so by violent castration after their deaths, whome they could not finde to haue made for their Errours by vnjust declaration in their liues.
               
                  
                  Senensis, therefore, in the Preface of his worke, dedicated to Pius the fift, not onelie confesseth this practise of Purgatorie paines by the Pen, taken about the Ancientes, but highlie also commendeth the Pope, for his care of performing the same, saying, Tu beatissime Pater expurgaricurasti omnia Catholicorum authorum scripta, &amp; praecipue veterum patrum: that is, Thou most blessed Father (sayth hee) hast caused purge all the Writs of Catholicke Wryters, and chiefelie the Fathers.
               
               Lyke-wise, this is avowed in the late Edition of S. Augustine,

                   by confession of our Adversaries them-selues; when Chrysostome is vrged for perfection of Scripture, against Papall Traditions, the Testimonie beeing taken out of his Commentarie on Matthew, (like as hee giveth witnesse to the same Trueth, commenting on the first to the Galatians, and 95 Psalme, which are vnsuspect works, and by all acknowledged to be his)

                  Bellarmine answereth thus, Locus hic ab Arrianis insertus, est quibusdam codicibus nuper emendatis sublatus: that is, This place (sayth he, by bare alleadgeance onlie) was insert by the Arrians, and out of some Bookes that are newlie amended, is quite purged away.
               
               Like-wise, for prooving of the same point of the Scriptures perfection, where-as the olde Impression of Athanasius hath a notable place,

               In lyke manner, in that fourth Booke, &amp; fourth Chapter of Sainct Ambrose, De Sacramentis, it is thus in the ancient and vncorrupted Copies, agaynst Transsubstantiation, Si ergo tanta vis est in sermone Domini, ut inciperent esse quae non erant, quanto magis est operatorius est ut sint quae erant, &amp; in aliud commutentur? that is, If therefore there bee such power in the speach of our Lord, that thinges which were not before, began to bee, (to wit, at the Creation) how much more (sayeth Ambrose) is the same powerful to make, that things may still bee that which they were before, and yet bee changed to another thing?
               But because these wordes, Vt sint quae erant, so clearlie crosse their Conceit, who after the wordes of Consecration, would haue the Elementes of Bread and Wyne, not to

bee anie more, that which they were before in substance; and to bee changed, onelie into that, which they were not before in vse: to wit, To bee Sacramentes. Therefore, they haue, for avoyding the troubling of their Braynes, in forging fectlesse Evasions, rather taken the shorter Cut, (as wee say) and haue in their Romane Edition, (which is also followed in that, set out in Paris, Anno 1603) quyte cut out, and purged away these words, which like evill Humours so much before distempered them; making them now smoothe so to run, Quanto magis operatorius est, ut qua erant, in aliud commutentu
                        •
                     : that is, How much more powerfull is our LORD'S speach, to make that those thinges which were, should bee changed into another thing? And so no Bone sticketh in their Throat.
               Agayne, in the same Matter, the Author of the imperfect worke, on Saynct Matthew, attributed to Chrysostome, Hom. 11. wryteth thus; If

it bee so dangerous a matter (sayeth hee) to transferre vnto private vses those holie Vessels, in which the true Bodie of Christ is not, but the mysterie of His Bodie is contayned; how much more for the Vessels of our Bodie, which God hath prepared for Him-selfe to dwell in, ought wee not to giue way to the Devill, to doe in them what hee pleaseth? Now these wordes, In quibus non est verum corpus Christi, sed mysterium corporis ejus continetur: that is, In which His true, or naturall Bodie, is not; but in which the mysterie of His Bodie is onelie contayned: because they did threatten so the Eversion of that Transsubstantiating Conversion of theirs, therefore it is, that in their later Editions, they haue hearkened to that saying, Abscindantur qui nos perturbant: and accordinglie, both in that Impression of this worke, at Antwerpe, apud Ioannem Steelsium, Anno 1537, and at Paris, apud Ioannem Roigny, Anno 1543, and at Paris agayne, apud Audoenum parvum,

Anno 1557, not one Syllable of them is to bee seene, tho extant in the older Editions, of the date of 1487, and after.
               More-over, Bertram, who wrote in the 800 yeare of GOD, agaynst Transsubstantiation, then peeping out, when in his Booke, of the Bodie and Blood of Christ, dedicated to the Emperour Carolus Calvus, who set him a-worke, hee hath clearlie in these wordes dashed that Babels Brood, agaynst the Stone of solide holie Writ, saying, Thinges which differ one from another, are not the same: the Bodie of Christ, which was dead, and rose agayne, and beeing made immortall, dieth no more, (Death having no more dominion over it) it is nowe ever-lasting, and not subject to suffering: But this which is celebrated in the Church, is temporall, not ever-lasting; it is corruptible, and not free from Corruption.
                     
                        〈1 paragraph〉
                     . But as they professe, in the Expurgatorie Index of this Author, when they haue

essayed, for escaping, to invent some fyne Devyce, and feigne some cōmodious Sense for them, which is this, to wit, That this is meant of the Accidents, or Formes of the Sacrament, (sayth he) which are corruptible. or of the vse of the Sacrament, which continueth onelie in this present worlde, and in that sense, is temporall. And when notwith-standing they see, that this will not serue them, in respect the whole scope of the Discourse is agaynst this Shift, and tendeth to proue, That it is not the naturall Bodie of Christ, which was borne, died, and rose agayne, which Christians externally receiue in the blessed Sacrament; what then is their next Recourse? Even this bankrout Shift, Non male aut inconsulte igitar omittantur omnia haec: that is, It is not amisse then, (say they) nor vnadvysedlie done, that those things be left out al-to-gether.
               Yea, not onlie haue they paired away parcels,Chap. 15. §. 4. but (as shall bee

showne, God willing, heere-after) they haue razed, and bereaved vs of whole Records, and entire Treatises, that haue made against them.
               And, as Erasmus in a word tolde vs before, who were those Aegyptian Flies, who were the Corrupters of the wholesome travels of ancient and holie Authors in the Church of CHRIST, before the noysome Crew of Iesuiticall Frogges, with more whoorish fore-heads, eased that filthie Swarme; and being the last Emissaries of that false Prophet, vnder-tooke that Taske: So, to confirme the trueth of Erasmus speach, I will heere relate one onlie proofe there-of, which that learned Father B. Vsher, helped to discover. In the yeare 1616, one Petrus Stuartius set foorth at Ingolstadt, amongst other Treatises, one especiallie, of Rabanus Maurus, Archbishop of Mentz, called his Penitentiall; in the 33 Chapter whereof, answering to a question of a Bisshop, named Heribaldus, concerning

the Eucharist, what became of it, after it was consumed after the manner of other Meates, and sent into the Draught; Rabanus hath these wordes, Pag. 669; Some of late, (sayth he) not holding rightlie of the Sacrament of the Bodie and Blood of our LORD, haue saide, That the verie Bodie and Blood of our LORD, vvhich vvas borne of the Virgine Marie, and in which our LORD Him-selfe suffered on the Crosse, and rose againe from the Graue. Against which Errour, writing vnto Abbot Egilius, According to our abilitie wee haue declared (sayth hee) what is truelie to bee believed concerning CHRIST'S Bodie. Heere wee see, then, that Rabanus tongue is clipt for telling of Tales, (as sayth that former Father:) first, therefore, wee must see who is the Doer, and next, what are the words that are razed out. Stevartius, the publisher, freeth him-selfe of the fact, telling vs in the margent, that hee

found that blank in the manuscript Copie. But whence had hee that manuscript? Out of that famous Monasterie of Weingart, (saith he:) So that wee see clearlie, that the Monkes of Weingart stand on the Chalke.
               Next, let vs see vvhat are the words that are razed: B. Vsher (as I said before) hath helped notablie to cleare this to Posteritie, thus: In the Liberaries of that worthie Knight, Sr 
                  Robert Cotton, and D. Ward, Mr of Sidney Colledge in Cambridge, hee found a Treatise of the Sacrament, of great Antiquitie, (as he reporteth) beginning thus, Sicut ante nos quidam sapiens dixit, &amp;c. In which the Author laying downe the opinion of Paschasius Radbertus, (who was Bertram's Antagonist) that the flesh which is received at the Altar, is no other than that which was borne of the Virgine Marie, and suffered on the Crosse, and rose out of the Graue, and is yet daylie offered, for the life of the Worlde, Contra quem
                  
(sayth this Author) satis argumentatur &amp; Rabanus in Epistola ad Egilonem Abbatem, &amp; Ratrannas quidam libro composito ad Carolum Regem, dicentes ali am esse: that is, Against vvhom, both Rabanus sufficientlie doth reason, in an Epistle vvritten to the Abbot Egilo; as also, one Ratrannus, (alias Bertramus) in a Booke made vnto King Charles, saying, That it is another kinde of f
                     •
                  esh, (to wit, Sacramentall.) Where-by we may now see, what it is that these razed-headed Monkes of Weingart, haue razed with their hands out of Rabanus Penitentiall; seeing vvee are given to vnderstand by this Author, vvhat his opinion vvas in this point, in his Epistle to Abbot Egilo. And therefore, that the fore-said blanke hath beene filled vp before vvith these vvords: to vvit, That the naturall Bodie of CHRIST, is that selfe same Bodie, which is by the mouth received at the Altar. Against vvhich Errour, (sayeth Rabanus) vvriting to Abbot Egilo, vve haue,

according to our abilitie, declare
                     •
                   vvhat is truelie to bee believed, (to vvit, the cleane contrarie.)

               FIrst, for proofe of this Practise, as the thirteenth Chapter shall giue Instances of their Alteration of the wordes of a whole Convent of Fathers, conveaned in Councell; So, how they deale with them particularlie, let these Examples testifie.

            Thus of the Fathers, of the first fiue Ages, in the primitiue Church, wee see, howe manie are confessed by our Adversaries, to bee corrupt and counterfeyt: and so, what vnsure Warrand Men haue to gather, or ground their Fayth, on such Writs and Workes. Which made their owne Senensis ingenuouslie to confesse,

Et propter foedissimas corruptelas quae eis inscribuntur: that is, It is vncertayne, what the Fathers define, and that both for the counterfeyt Bookes, which falselie are ascrybed vnto them, as also for the most filthie Errours that are insert into them.

And which Practise, wee see, continued after the Apostles dayes most perniciouslie: Therefore the Arrians wrote a Letter to Constantine, vnder the name of Athanasius: the Eutychians also a Letter, agaynst Cyrillus Alexandrinus,

            AN APPENDIX, For discerning of Counterfeyts.
            FIrst, there are 30 Epistles, or there-about, of ancient Romane Bishops, obtruded vnto vs, for the Pope's Supremacie, and other Popish Errours, vvhich to bee altogether counterfeyt, heere-by may bee knowne.
            1. By the matter contained in them, of pleading for Supremacie, which was never so much as once thought vpon by those holie Bishops, as their owne Duaren,

                  quis Episcopis Ecclesiarum ipsis commissarum liberam administrationem reliquerint, quasi urbis unius magis quam orbis Episcopi: that is, It is no doubt, but that the more ancient and holie Bishops of Rome, contenting them-selues with their owne proper Seat, and Church, did leaue to other Bishops the free administration of their Churches in like manner; as being Bishops rather of one Citie, than of the whole World, (to wit, by the new, and now claimed vniversall Supremacie.) A Pope of their owne testifying likewise,

            Next, those Epistles are farced

vvith the injunction of an heape of Ceremonies, vvhich were not, not onlie in their times heard of, but a long time after in the Church of CHRIST,

                  •
               ooke care to plant the essentiall Doctrines of Faith, than to plant Ceremonies in the Church of CHRIST.
            2. By the manner, or forme of speach vsed in them, as by a cleare Shibboleth, they may bee discerned counterfeyt; beeing written in such a barbarous sort of Diction, vvhich was no wayes to bee heard, especiallie amongst such learned Bishops, as then vvere in Rome; the Latine Language in those times being there (as it were, at the Fountaine head) pure, terse and neate, in the mouthes of all Men.
            
               3. Their Style is all one, which never hapneth to bee so, vvithout diversitie, amongst diversitie of W

               ters, except these

                onlie: vvho vvere the Spirits Pen men, of Sacred and holie Scripture, where one was onlie Indyter, altho the Scribes were diverse.
            4. There is no alleadgeance of them, in the most famous Councels, by anie Romane Bishops, or their Deputies, where either Lawes were made against anie such Supremacie, as in the Councels of Constantinople, Chalcedon,

Ephes. c. 6. and Ephesus, or where hottest contestation was for anie such; either by the Bishop of Rome, for himselfe, as in the fact of Zozimus, at the Councell of Carthage, or in the impugning the vsurpatiō of it by another, as in the writings of Gregorie is apparent, against the Patriarch of Constantinople.
            
            5. There is no mention of those Epistles in the works and writings of the most ancient and primitiue Doctors, that either lived then, or

a long time there-after, in the first 400 yeares, &amp; aboue: which doubtlesse, if anie such had beene, they had not escaped so their notice, nor they omitted some-where, and vpon some occasions, to made mention thereof.
            Secondlie, for discerning betweene the true vvrytinges of Fathers, and those that are counterfeyt, and palliate vnder their names.
            1. The diversitie of the Stile, discovers the diversitie of the writers, to a judicious Remarker; so that, as Augustine speaketh of Cyprian,
               
                  Aug. Epist. 48. saying, Cypriani stylus habet propriam quandam faciem, qua possit agnosci: that is, Cyprian's Style hath a certayne proper Face, or resemblance, where-by it may bee knowne: Even so, the verie lyke may bee sayde of others. And by this Note of Cognisance, Bellarmine him-selfe maketh sequestration, of sundrie Patches, from the other Workes of ancient Wryters, whose name they pretende.
            
               2. The grosse Slips, which are found in those counterfeyt Additions show, that they goe masked onelie, vnder false Titles, which proceedeth from Ignorance, or neglect of computation of Tymes: and those Slips are eyther in nomination of persons, or recording of Heresies, or mentionating of Actions.
            By the first sorte, are discovered, Iustinus Questions to bee none of his, because in the 82 Question, mention is made of Origen, who was not borne an hundreth and od yeares after. So is Dionysius Areopagita, dignosced to bee counterfeyt, in hi
                  •
                Booke, De Divinis nominibus; Clements Stromateus beeing cited, who lived not 200 after. So is Chrysostome's Liturgie, Pope Nicolas being made mention of there-in, who lived almost 300 yeares after. So are Eucherius Commentaries, where-in hee citeth Gregorius, who lived 100 yeares there-after. As also, so are judged Saynct Ambrose Epistles: in

the 82 where-of, mention is made of Venice, which was not builded, nor begun, long after his death.
            By the second sorte, are discovered, Cyprian's Exposition of the Creede, to bee none of his; Because Arrius, Eunomius, &amp; Photinus, Heretickes, who were not borne in Cyprian's tyme, are by him refuted. So is that booke of Eusebius Emissenus, dignosced to be counterfeyt; wherin hee maketh mention of the Pelagian Heresie, which was not a long tyme broached after his death. In lyke manner, Saynct Ambrose Epistles are discovered, to bee of the same Stampe, where-in the same Heresie is mentionated: which vnto Saynct Ambrose was vtterlie vnknowne. And Tertullian's booke, De Trinitate, is made to march in the same Ranke; Because the Sabellians are there refuted, who rose not in his tyme.
            By the last sort, is that Epistle of Pope Clement,

                  •
               shop of Ierusalem, by Bellarmine himselfe thus

proven to be counterfeyt; Because Saynct Iames died seaven years before Saynct Peter's death; after whom Clement then onelie succeed
                  •
               d: and therefore beeing Bishop seaven yeares after the death of Saynct Iames, could not therefore as Bishop of Rome written to Sainct Iames, who had died (as sayde is) seaven yeares before.
            An-other notable Example I will set downe, How that counterfeyt Letter,
                  
                     〈…〉
                   206. of that notable Popish Impostor, as written by Saynct Cyrill, Bishop of Ierusalem, vnto Saynct Augustine, touching the Miracles of Saynct Ierome, is clearlie discovered. This counterfeyt Pedler, sharplie taxeth the Grecians, for their denyall of Purgatorie, saying, These wicked Sectaries did also mayntayne, That there was no place of Purgatorie, where-in the Soules, which had not done full Pennance for their sinnes in this worlde, might bee purged, (sayeth hee.) Then he telleth a Tale, how Sainct

               Ierome, being at that tyme after his death with God, for the confutation of this New-sprung-vp Heresie, raysed vp three Men from the dead, after that he had first led their Soules into Paradise, Purgatorie, and Hell: to the ende, that they might make knowne to all men, the thinges that were done there. Now remarke, that Saynct Cyrill, who is made the Relater to Saynct Augustine, of this Miracle, which Saynct Ierome wrought after his death, died before Saynct Ierome, the space of 30 yeares, (as is known to everie one, who knoweth the Historie of those tymes.) And so hee maketh Saynct Cyrill to wryte 30 yeares after his death; as if hee had beene the Surviver of Saynct Ierome: where-as, on the contrarie, Saynct Ierome was his Surviver so long after. And therefore, it would haue fitted him, rather to wryte of anie thing, that fell foorth after the death of Saynct Cyrill, than Saynct Cyrill to haue related, what befell

after the death of Ierome. And yet, not-with-standing of the palpablenesse of such Forgerie,

And yet remarke, how this Impostor would haue cleare mention made thereof, in a most ancient Doctor, and a Grecian Father to patronize, what the whole Grecian Church hitherto ever did reject.
            
               3. The contrarietie that is found in the writings of Ancients, discovereth clearlie, that manie things goe vnder their names ofttimes, where-vnto they were never accessorie: and by this Bellarmine him-selfe proveth, that pretended Epistle written by Pope Clement, to S. Iames the Apostle, to bee a plaine Counterfeyt; it beeing maintained there-in, That all things should bee common: which else-where S. Clement had refuted. And therefore, Quis credat ea à S.

            4. The Application also of the pretended writinges of the most ancient Doctors, vnto those times where-in they lived, will serue much lyke-wyse, to discover such Counterfeyts, which march insidiouslie

            Thus may it truelie bee spoken of the Romanistes, vvhich Anastasius Sinaita Patriarch of Antioch, reporteth of the Hereticke Severus, in his booke written against the Severians: to wit, Even as hee had beene the Iudge of the quicke and the dead, hee so vsed, at his pleasure, the Fathers of the Church: receiving vvhome hee pleased, and rejecting in them what-so-ever hee listed. And that this same is done now, by our Adversaries, the preceeding Examples doe evidentlie show.

Whereas

the holy Father, Chrysostome, could not haue meaned by the Cup, the blood in the bodie: seeing by the contrarie, the Cup is ever called, (and that by Christ Him-selfe) The blood that is shed, and powred out of the bodie: neyther could hee possiblie more clearlie haue spoken, distinguishing betweene the Bread and the Cup, and declaring, that vnder both kindes, Eating and Drinking, the people of olde did duelie communicate.
               
               
                  
                     2. How they answere, by tempering the words of the Fathers.
                  OF this fraudfull Shift, by tempering (as they call it) the wordes of the Fathers, to play to their Tune, wee haue a notable Example, in our fore-saide Bellarmine:

                      vvho treating of the Irremissiblenesse of the Sinne against the Holie Ghost, and that it is helde to bee absolutelie such, he saieth, This appeareth to be the minde of Athanasius,

Hilarie, Ierome, and Anselmus, on the twelft of Matthew, Videtur tamen temperanda, (saieth hee) id est, irremissibile esse ordinarie &amp; ut plarimum: that is, But their speach would bee tempered, to wit, that this Sinne is ordinarilie irrimissible, and for the most part. Which is both contrarie to the wordes of those Fathers, as also contrarie to the verie absolute speach of Christ;
                        Bell. l. 4. de panit. c. 13. sect. Resp.
                      and last of all, crosseth his owne Rule, saying, Non oportet restringere, quod Deus amplum esse voluit: that is, We must not make a restriction of those words, which God will haue to bee absolutelie taken.
                  The like Example we haue also, in qualifying of Sainct Bernard's wordes, which wee adduce against popish Merites, out of his 310 Epistle: where-in hee declareth, that his whole life, even to the verie last period there-of, which hee calleth Calcaneum, was al-to-gether destitute of Merites. But how aunswereth Bellarmine, and qualifieth, or

tempereth hee this Speach? Perhaps (saieth hee) hee spake this humbly, but not truely.
                        Bell. lib. 5. de Iustif. c. 6. sect. ad alia.
                      Which sense against sense, Bernard him-selfe else-where pithilie over-throweth, saying, When ye haue done all things that are commanded, say, that yee are vnprofitable Servantes. But thou wilt say,

                      (saieth Bernard) that hee willed vs to say so, for Humilities sake. Yes, indeede. But willed he thee to say that, against the Trueth? No.
               
               
                  
                     3. How they fraudfullie, in their Aunsweres to the Fathers, disjoynt thinges, not to bee disjoyned; and conjoyne thinges, that are not conjoyned.
                  AN Example of the first, wee haue in Bellarmine,
                     
                        Bell lib. 4. de Euch. c. 16. who intreating of the lawfull Minister of the Eucharist, hee citeth Epiphanius, to proue, that Christ gaue no power, even to the Virgine Marie, to celebrate a Sacrament. But when the

same Father is cited by vs, against baptizing by Women; showing also, out of Epiphanius, That the Virgine Marie was never permitted by Christ, nor his Apostles, anie way to baptize;
                        Bell. lib. 1. de Bapt. c. 7. sect. Quario.
                      
                     Bellarmine aunswereth, Loquitur (saieth hee) de publico ministerio baptismi: that is, Epiphanius speaketh onlie of the publicke Ministerie of Baptisme. Where-as by disjoyning the publicke ministration of Baptisme, from the private ministration, hee may see, that the verie like answere might bee made vnto him-selfe, That Women are not excluded from celebrating the Communion in private; but that they are debarred onelie from the publicke ministration of the same. And so his Conclusion out of Epiphanius, concerning the lawfull Minister of the Eucharist, shall bee quite over-throwne.
                  An Example of the seconde, which is a fraudfull Conjunction of diverse Speaches, which are of diverse matters, as if they were one,

we haue like-wise in Bellarmine,
                     
                        Bell. lib. 2. de

                        Greg. l. 3. Epist. 11. and no-wise of the age of Nunnes: VVhere-as, both the Title, and the Epistle it selfe, showeth, that hee speaketh, both of the Abbatesse in the generall, Ne sit Iuvencula, that is, That shee bee not a young woman;1. Tim. 3.6. as Paul speaketh of a Bishop, That hee be not a young Scholler: and of the Nunnes which are to bee vailed in particular, Ne fiat earum velamen, (saieth hee) ante annum sexagesimum: that is, Let them not bee vailed, before they be three-score yeares of age.
               
               
                  
                     4. How they answere the Fathers, alleadging their speaches to be hyperbolicke, when they are no-wise so.
                  EXamples of this, like-wise, Bellarmine affordeth vs, who when

                     Chrysostome's speach is adduced,

                  And againe, when hee is opposed against their Private Masse, saying, That it is better, not to bee present at the Sacrament, or at that (cōmemoratiue) Sacrifice of Christs bodie, than to be present, &amp; yet not to communicate:

Now, by his owne definition, of an hyperbolicke speach, let vs see then, howe sillie a Shift hee vseth, for fraudfull Evasion. An hyperbolicke speach (saieth hee) requireth,

                           〈◊〉
                        . then Bellarmine rejecteth

Sainct Iames Lyturgie, vpon this reason, Nam non omnia quae in Lyturgia habentur (saieth hee) dep

                        ompta sunt ex Domini exemplo aut praecepto, constat enim multa esse addita ab aliis, &amp;c. that is, For all things that are contained in that Lyturgie, are not taken out of the Lord's Example, or Cōmandement: for it is evident, that manie thinges were added, or patched to, by others. Therefore the Grecians (saith Bellarmine) should proue by some Testimonie, (which they are not able to doe) that those wordes did flow from the wordes, or else from the fact of CHRIST. VVhich Reason given by Bellarmine against the Grecians, (who with vs denye Consecration to be by those wordes recited, Hoc est Corpus meum) is a most valide Reason, furnished by him, vnto vs, VVhy we doe, and should, reject all thinges in the Masse, which doeth not flowe, either from the wordes, or fact of our Saviour, but are mens Inventions, added to, or altring that holie Institution.

                      And againe, else-where hee saieth, It is sure (saieth hee) that hee erred not in this, because no Author counteth this amongst Tortullian's Errours. And yet, when wee produce Tertullian, against Popish Indulgences, and other pointes of Poperie,
                        Bell. l. 1. de indulg. cap. 3. §.

                        . 
                     Bellarmine rejecteth him, as hereticall, altho his owne wordes may stop his mouth. And wee may say even so vnto him, That al-be-it hee was a Montanist in his latter age, yet hee was never reprehended by anie of the Ancients in this, That ever hee erred in the matter of Indulgences, &amp;c. and no Author counted ever this amongst Tertullian's Errours.
                  
                     Thus vse they diverse Weights in the Bag, which is Abhomination: they claime, and disclaime, for craftie Seduction, against all Civill Honestie, Setled Constancie, Christian Integritie, Reasons Rule, Conscience Regiment, or any way equitable Indifferencie.
                  Neither is there anie, but may see, that wee yeelding vnto them, the Fathers to bee onelie Expounders of Scripture, and admitting their Writs to decide all Controversies; yet are wee not with them at anie nearer point, while as they will bee such Expounders of the Fathers againe, making their Exposition often times quite contrarie to the Text, and (as Pharaoh's leane Kye did to the farte) the one (as hath beene showne) to eate vp the other.

               1. By citing of Heretickes wordes for them as if they were the wordes of the Orthodox Fathers.

                     mine, who to proue, by the Testimonie of Fathers, That Scripture without Tradition, is sufficient to determine Controversies citeth Ireneus: alleadging, Because the

Scriptures are Variouslie expounded, that there-fore Scripture onlie cannot bee Iudge. VVhich wordes are not Ireneus owne wordes,
                     Bell. l. 3. de ver
                        
                           •
                        o c. 8. (as Bellarmine giveth them out) neither did Ireneus ever alleadge anie such Reason, as that There was need of Tradition, because the Scriptures were Variouslie expounded: but hee setteth downe this, to bee the Hereticke's Reason, for Traditions, whome Ireneus refuteth.
                     Iren. l. 3. c. 2. There-fore, Ireneus wordes are these, VVhen they are convinced out of Scripture, (saieth Ireneus, speaking of the Heretickes of his time) straight-way they fall out, in the accusing of Scripture it selfe, as if thinges were not well set downe there, nor that the same had not authoritie of its owne, and because the same is variouslie expounded, and there-fore Trueth cannot bee found there-in, by those that are ignorant of Traditions. In which wordes, Ireneus, if hee had beene living, and heard a Papist in our dayes, pleading for Traditions,

and accusing God's word of Imperfection, Obscuritie, plyablenesse anie way, and wanting authoritie of its owne, (but such as it hath from the Church, and the Pope) he could not more viuelie haue painted, nor described him, than hee doeth heere, by the Patterne of an olde Hereticke.
               This necessarie Caution, therefore, wee would keepe, for obviating such Fraude; that is, we would carefullie remarke, that the wordes bee a Father's owne words, which are adduced, and expressing to vs, his owne mynde and meaning. And this wee should doe, not onelie in cleare places, as this former is; but vvee would more carefullie advert the same, in some that are obscurer, in which it can bee hardlie discerned, vvhether the vvords bee a Father's owne, or some Heretick's, vvhom hee refuteth. An Instance vvhere-of, Bellarmine him-selfe giveth vs, saying of a Testimonie cited out of Clemens Alexandrinus,
                  
which seemeth to favour the Pelagian Heresie, It is not surelie known (sayth he) whose those words bee,

And to this, the Reader would the more diligentlie take heede, because the Papists (lyke the Donatists) out of the obscurest places of Scripture, or Fathers, ever seeke to make their best advantage.

                        •
                     ie was conceived without Originall Sin, hee adduceth a Testimonie, wherein Augustine never meaned, nor affirmeth, that in her owne conception shee was free from Originall Sinne; but onlie, that from the time of CHRIST'S cōception in her wombe, that shee was preserved

thence-foorth from actual sinning, thorow that singular Priviledge (as he thought) that then was granted vnto her, by being the Mother of the Lord Iesus. And that this is the trueth, we shall cleare the same, out of their Master of Sentences, who speaking of Christ's conception, showeth what was the qualitie of the flesh of the Virgine Marie, before that time, and in that verie instant, to wit, sinfull, as the rest of the race of Adam,

Sentences haue saide thus farre, of Christ's owne conception, then he commeth in the next Section, to d

                  clare what Priviledge was given to Marie, after that time of Christ's conception, to wit, That from thence-foorth shee was fred from actuall sinne: and to this effect, hee citeth that same place of Augustine, which Bellarmine wresteth, and abuseth, to proue her Immunitie from Originall Sinne, even in her owne conception; and which Augustine, nor none of the Fathers, ever once did meane.

                     Bell. lib. 2. de purg. c. 18. &amp;c. 5. and Bellarmine him-selfe informeth vs, how those prayers stand without anie supposall of Purgatorie at all, to wit, Relation beeing had to the seconde Sentence, or full accomplishment, that the whole Man is to receiue, by a solemne and publick Sentence of Acquitall in that Day frō Sinne, or the Consequences▪ there-of, and by an Adjudgement to a full Consummation of all perfect Happinesse, compryzed al in short words, by the Apostle, for Onesiphorus, saying, (whyle hee was alyue) The Lord grant vnto him, that hee may fynde Mercie of the Lord in that Day.

                  ceth the Testimonies of those Fathers, vvhich speake of this same Fyre, and none other, to proue the Popish Fyre of Purgatorie, immediatly after death, although so farre different, both in tyme, and in extense to persons.
               Seeing, therefore, Bellarmine disclaymeth this fore-sayde Opinion, as erronious, vvhy vrgeth hee the Testimonies of Fathers agaynst vs, to proue fraudfullie, vnder the name of (Ignis Purgans) their Popish Fyre of Purgatorie? before the Resurrection, &amp; which after death is indured by some onlie: where-as those Fathers meaned a farre diverse Fyre, to wit, which should be at the Resurrection onelie, and should bee suffered by all indifferentlie.
               
                  And yet, that he doth this most impudentlie, let this cleare the Trueth. To proue that the Fathers held such an erronious Opinion, as is fore-saide,
                     Bell. lib. 2. de purg. c. 1. 
                  Bellarmine bringeth S. Ambrose wordes, on the 118 Psalme, and twentie Sermon, saying in the fourth of Genesis, That the Lord did put a flaming Sworde before the entrie of Paradise: which (sayeth Bellarmine) hee calleth that purging Fyre, thorow which of necessitie everie one must passe, who-so-ever they bee that enter into Paradise. And yet hee bringeth the same Father,
                     Bell. lib.

                   in this same verie place, and those same verie wordes, to proue the Elph-fyre of their Popish Purgatorie.
               In lyke manner, Bellarmine citeth Augustine,
                  
                     Bell. lib. 1. de purg. c. 10. §. B. Aug.
                   to patronize their Purgatorie, in his 21 booke, De Civitate Dei, and 16 Chapter, and 24: where hee affirmeth, That some shall suffer certayne Purgatorie Punishmentes, before the last Iudgement. Which beeing compared with the

25 Chapter, of the 20 booke, it will appeare clearlie there-by, that hee meaneth that Fyre of Conflagration, that shall immediatelie goe before the last daye of Generall Doome; and not that Popish Fyre of Purgatorie, that is suffered after the day of particular Death. And the effect where-of, hee showeth shall bee this,
                     Aug. in Psal. 103. conc. 3. to wit, That it shall separate some to the left hand, and melt out others, to the right hand of CHRIST; and so consequently shall seaze on all men, both wicked and Godlie.
               To obviate, therefore, this Fraude, the 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , or ground Errour, would carefully be adverted; that if they reject the Roore of such Colloquintid
                        •
                     
                   themselues, they vrge vs not with the Blade, or Branch, nor fraudfullie make that to serue their Turne, by clayming the Fathers, in such a poynt, wholie to make for them, vvhyle as tryall doeth discover, that them-selues rejecting the

Ground, they, Ipso facto, lyke-wyse disclayme the super-structure.
               And this the more warily would bee seene vnto, because the Ground Errour is some-tymes more latent, especiallie to one, that is not acquaynted with such a Father his whole workes, whose Testimonie is cited: one notable Example where-of, I will instance, out of our Adversaries bringing of Theophylact, for the countenancing of their praying, and offering for the dead: not considering his Ground Errour, where-vpon this a-rose; vvhich was not for bringing the Soules of those out of Purgatorie, who died onelie with the guilt of Veniall Sinnes; but to saue the Soules of those out of Hell, vngone there, who had died impenitentlie, with the guilt of haynous sinnes; and which hee thought, by the Prayers and Oblations of the living, might be gotten done: grounding his Errour on that Speach of our Saviour,
                     Theophyl. in Luk. 12. 
                  Luke 12, 5, in which

hee wisheth vs, to obserue, That Christ did not say, Feare him, who after hee hath killed, casteth into Hell; but, hath power to cast into Hell. For the sinners, which die, (sayeth he) are not all-wayes casten into Hell: but it remayneth in the power of GOD, to pardon them also. And this I say, for the Oblations and Doales, which are made for the dead, which doe not a little avayle them, which die even in grievous sinnes: Where-fore, let vs not cease, by Almes, and Intercession, to appeale Him that hath power to cast, but doeth not alwayes vse this power, (sayeth hee) but is able to pardon also.
            
            
               
                  4. How they cite words of Fathers, which no-wyse are in their Writs.
               FOR a cleare Evidence of this,
                     Bell. lib. 1. de purg. c. 10. let this one Practise of Bellarmine's sufficientlie examplifie, who to proue Purgatorie, doeth cite these wordes, out of Theodoret's

contrarie to the meaning of the Calvinists. Thus wee see Faction, not Affection to the Trueth; Prejudice, not sound Iudgement; and the hatred of persons, and not the regard of Cause simplie, so in these to prevaile, that we may loose hope, that wee can availe them.

                  In particular, therefore, to show how this Fyning, and Forging, is practized in the Romane Mint, before the Canons of Councels passe for currant Money, in the Papall Kingdome, wee will first instance their Popish Patching, and adding to the same.
                  
                     A notable Example where-of, wee haue in that fact of Pope Zozimus, who added to that famous first Councell of Nice, a Canon in his owne favours: whose Fraude was detected, his Pryde checked, and his Vsurpation prevented, by that famous Councel of Carthage, which standeth vp yet, in the faythfull Records thereof, as a Clowde of Witnesses, to testifie the same, even vnto this day.
                  Next, whereas the fourth Councell of Carthage, decreeth expresselie, That no Woman baptize; yet not-with-standing, for mayntayning their Popish Practise in the contrarie, they

                  Agayne, for vp-holding of Papall

                      (vvhich is contayned lykewyse in their Canon Law) wherein the Popes mayntayning of that Nicolaitane Errour, is evident, to wit, Of having all thinges in common, where-in Wyues are also comprehended: and where-vpon it clearlie and consequentlie followeth, that the Pope may erre, and Popes haue monstruously erred. But what haue they done for this, in the new

Editions of the Councels? Even this, to wit, They haue purged, and put out those wordes, that Wy

                     3. How they alter the Wordes and Canons of the Councels.
                  A Notable Example heere-of, in Surius his Editiō of the Councels,

                         97. and their Epitomizer Caranza, who for eschewing the clearnesse of that ancient Councell of Laodicea,
                     
                        
                           〈…〉
                         35. against the worshipping of Angels, hath without either sense, or shame, put Angulos, for Angelos: So that, where-as the Councell sayth, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     : that is, It is not lawfull for Christians to pray vnto Angels,

they make the wordes to bee, Non oportet Christianos ad angulos congregationes facere: that is, Christians must not conveane in corners. And where-as the Title of the Canon is, De iis qui angelus colunt: that is, Of those that worship Angels: they make it to be thus, agaynst all sense, De iis qui angulos colunt: that is, Of those that worship Corners. An absurd Tale.
                  VVhich Fraude, and Falsification, Saynct Theodoret most clearlie convinceth;
                        Theod. in Coloss. 
                        
                           •
                        . who commenting on the Collossians, maketh mention thus, of this famous Decree, They who defended the Law, (sayth hee) they induced Christians also to the worshipping of Angels, saying, That the Law was given by them. And this erronious Vyce cōtinued long in Phrygia and Pisidia: VVherefore, that Councell, (sayth he) which assēbled at Laodicea, which is the Metropolitane Citie of all Phrygia, by a Law did prohibite, That no man should pray to Angels.
                  
                     The same Caranza lyke-wyse, for mayntayning the Pope's Supremacie, agaynst the sixt Canon of the Councel of Nice, alleadgeth, that hee sawe in a most ancient Latine Edition of the Councels, which the most Reverend Cardinall Marcellus shew him, (who was Legate to the Pope, in the Councell of Trent) the wordes of that Canon, set downe thus, Quoniam Metropolitano Episcopo hoc idem moris est: that is, Because this same is the Custome of the Metropolitane Bishoppe. VVhere-as in the vp-right Copies of the Nicene Councell, it is thus, Quoniam Episcopo Romano parilis mos est: that is, That the Bishop of Alexdria should haue power over those that were in his Diocie, because the Bishop of Rome had the same custome of jurisdiction, to wit, over those that were in his Diocie. VVhich confyning of his jurisdiction, onelie within his Westerne Precinct, or Diocie of Rome, and equalling other Bishops with him,

in a-lyke jurisdiction within their severall Precincts, doeth al-to-gether ever this Challenge of Supremacie: &amp; there-fore, for eschewing the force of that Canon of Nice, the Falsifyer of the same, had pulled out the Pope, out of the Comparison, as if none should compare with him in Iurisdiction, and put in anie poore Metropolitane Bishop, in that Comparison with the Bishop of Alexandria. And which grosse and filthie Falsification of Councels, wee see is an olde Practise of theirs, &amp; may bee seene yet, in their Cardinals Liberaries, and in the Bosome of the Church of Rome.
                  
                  Like-wise, where-as the seconde Councell of Orange, holden in Anno 529, agaynst the Pelagians, and Semi-Pelagians, condemning their erronious Doctrine, concerning Grace, and Free-will, set downe, amongst other Conclusions, this in particular: This also we wholesomlie professe, and belieue, (say they) That in everie good worke, wee

doe not begin, and are holpen after-wardes, by the Grace of God: but Hee first of all, [Nullis praecedentibus bonis meritis,] that is, No good merites of ours going before, inspireth in vs, both Fayth, and the loue of Him, &amp;c. This Canon Binius, in his Edition of the Tomes of the Councell, for mayntayning Popish Free-will, and Merits of Congruitie, hath taken both Freedome of Will, and of Action also, notoriouslie to corrupt this wholesome Canon, and to put in for Nullis meritis bonis praecedentibus: that is, No good Merits of ours going before, Multis meritis bonis praecedentibus: that is, Manie good Merites of ours going before. Now, for Merites of Congruitie; what Congruitie is betweene Nullis and Multis; None, and Manie, let anie one judge. And that this Corruption of Binius, or at least, (if they call it) The Errour of the TYPOGRAPHER, were carefullie attended, and avoyded in latter Editions, I would gladlie wish.
               
               
                  
                  Secondlie, How they accuse the Councels, when they make against them, eyof Fraude, and Ignorance, in determination; or else, of after-falsification.

there-of in another poynt him-selfe, to wit, agaynst the invocation of Sayncts: and therefore he cannot say, Patres in uno sapere, (sayth hee) &amp; in alio delirasse: that is, That the Fathers were wise in one point, but proved sottish in another. And yet, speaking of that famous first Councel of Chalcedō,
                     
                        Bell. lib. 3. de Laicu c. 20. §. ad hoc.

                      That in so farre it was approven by Pope Hadrian, but wherin it displeased his Holinesse, it was rejected, vpon this reason, Because the Pope was not there-by him-selfe, nor his Legates. VVhich reason, if it were sufficient for rejecting a Councell; then vpon the same might that second famous &amp; Generall Councell bee rejected, vvhich was celebrated at Constantinople, agaynst Macedonius, that denyed the Deitie of the Spirit. For

thus doeth Bellarmine confesse hereof,

                      saying, That it is to bee noted, that in that Councell, not one of the Westerne partes was there: and yet it is whollie approven, &amp; Pope Gregorie reverenced the same, as one of the foure Gospels.

                     Lyke-wyse, in the poynt of Papal Supremacie, Bellarmine, to proue the same by ancient Councels, citeth the Florentine. But when a Canon of the same Councell, is cited agaynst Vnction in Confirmation, as no-wyse Apostolicall,

But when the same Councel is cited, to proue the Councell, aboue the Pope, it is rejected, with no gentler Styles, than Conciliabulum Schismaticum, Seditiosum, &amp; nullius Authoritatis: that is,

A Schismaticke Conventicle, and a seditious, which is of no Authoritie.

Basill then was lawfull in the beginning, but vnlawfull in the ending, because it displeaseth the Pope. And Constance heere in the contrarie, is vnlawfull in the beginning, but lawfull in the ende, because it pleaseth him. So that wee may see, altho Bishops in Councels be Iudges, and haue a decisme Vote, so that, whereon they agree, (according to Bellarmine's assertion) they may say,

                      It seemed good to the holie Ghost, and to vs. Yet when they haue decreeted all, even Sub anathemate, yet

the Pope, out of his supereminent power, may admit what hee list, or reject what hee pleaseth; and so advanceth himselfe aboue the holie Ghost, (to whom in the decreeing those things, seemed good) and consequentlie aboue GOD, and that which is worshipped.

                  LAST of all, what regard they carrie in their late Papall Councels, to the most principall, &amp; onlie greatest Antiquitie of Divine Institution, Apostolicall Practise, and holie Custome of the primitiue Church, which is the onelie way

that should bee inquired for, let their avowed Confession, of the Transgression of those Sacred Limits, &amp; their professed Declyning from that primitiue Path, testifie: saying thus in Councel, concerning the matter of the holie Eucharist.

These are the verie plaine wordes of those Popish Prelates, in the Councell of Constance.
               
               And yet Bellarmine, for this Reâson onelie, of Disagreement from

Christ's Institution,
                     Bell. lib. 1. de Euch. c. 2. and His owne Practise or Example there-in, rejecteth Saynct Iames Lyturgie: making, that want of Conformitie there-to, (as to the Patterne in the Mount) a just cause of rejecting any prescription in God's Sacred worship, vvhether contrarie, or diverse there-from.
               No marvell, there-fore, as the Iewes rejected Christ Him-selfe, preferring to Him, Barabbas; so that after Him, also they persecuted His Disciples: And even so, it is no marvell, that the Romanists nowe reject at their pleasure, the fore-sayde humane Testimonies, which are agaynst them; preferring to Sacred Antiquitie, their new Venome of Heresie; vvhen they so peartlie, and publicklie, professe their Incroaching vpon the most ancient Institution, and Sacred Testament of the verie Sonne of GOD, and the Great Seale of HIS Glorious Kingdome.

                      that is, The

Relation of Aeneas Sylvius, is not partlie true. And so the Cardinall giveth his Holinesse, roundlie the Lie.

                  And, vvhen Durand and Adrian, are produced, to testifie, That Gregorie did erre, Bellarmine aunswereth shortlie,

                      and sayeth, That Gregorie erred not: but they rather erred, departing from the Trueth, (sayeth hee) in reporting so.
               
               
                  
                  
                     2. How they alleadge them to be corrupt, when they make agaynst them.
                  FOr instancing heere-of: vvhen vvee bring a place out of Eusebius, agaynst papall Supremacie; showing, If anie had the same in the Apostles dayes, it was Iames, the Lord's Brother, who was bishop of Hierusalem, and is called Episcopus Apostolorum; Bellarmine aunswereth heere-to,

                     Locum sine dubio esse corruptum: that is, That the place of Eusebius, is without all doubt, corrupted.
                  Agayne, when we bring agaynst the same Supremacie, the Act of that auncient Councell of Carthage, (as their owne Gratian citeth,
                        Grat. Dist. 99. c. prima.
                      and setteth it downe) That none, no, not the bishop of Rome, should bee called Vniversall; and which in effect pope Gregorie him-selfe doeth testifie;

and there-fore, that the same is of no authoritie, nor his Relation there-of, of anie credit at all.
                  Like-wise, let vs see, how vpō incertayne probabilities, and conjecturall suspicions onlie, they reject what-so-ever they finde to make agaynst them.
                  VVhen that Record is adduced of pope Boniface the second, who in his Letter to Eulalius, bishop of Thessalonica, maketh manifest, That the whole Fathers, of that famous Councell of Carthage being excommunicated of the bishop of Rome, in token of their not acknowledgement of such power, or Supremacie, that they remayned so, without regard there-of, for the space of an hundreth yeares, and died, moste of them all, vnder the said Censure, (Augustine being one of them, &amp; yet accounted a Saynct) Bellarmine hereto aunswereth,

                      Wee justlie contemne (sayeth hee) Fasciculus Temporum, and the Passional chiefelie, seeing Fasciculus followeth Marianus Scotus, who contradicteth most clearlie both himselfe and the Trueth.

But when hee is adduced by vs, to prooue the noveltie of Auricular Confession, and that the first enjoynet there-of, was Innocent the third, Bellarmine rejecteth Platina,

                  In lyke manner, in a matter of Historie, for proofe, that Peter substituted Clement to succeed him,

That there is no trust to bee given to him.
                  Also Gregorie's Dialogues, and the Stories there-in contayned, are cyted by Bellarmine,

                  Thus vse they their Historicians at their pleasure, whether ancient or more recent, even as Herod vsed the Baptist; who altho hee heard him in manie things gladlie, yet he rejected and persecuted him, in the matter of Herodias.
                  
               
               
                  
                  
                     4. How they haue so forged, and corrupted Recordes that are extant, and taken others al-together out of the way, that in things concerning the Trueth, which maketh agaynst them, they haue left verie little to bee seene, and feysted in, manie contrarie Falsehoods.
                  
                  THE thing that ever that Whoore of Babylon hath most laboured for,
                        Aeneas Sylvius, alias Pius 2. Epist. 288. and her Suppostes for her haue most endevoured, hath beene still A Supreame, and sole Soveraignitie. The which, altho a Pope, and one of the Sitters on that Scarlet-coloured Beast, doeth ingenuouslie confesse, That Rome was free, and farre from the lyke Challenge, or the Church of GOD, from the acknowledgement of anie such Diotrephes-lyke

Preheminence, in her purest and primitiue tymes, whyle as shee remayned as an holie and chaste Spouse vnto CHRIST, vnder the Dragon's Persecution, till the tyme of the Councell of Nice. Yet, that the World may bee borne in hand, That such Supremacie, as is nowe challenged, was ever reckoned due to that Seate of Majestie; and that even from the verie beginning, and profession of true Christianitie▪ that shee did sit as a Queene; there-fore, for probation heere-of, and to make vp that Gappe betweene the Apostolicall tymes, and that Councell of Nice, they haue forged some Decretall Epistles,Decretall Epistles counterfeyt. of the bishops of Rome, to haue interveaned, fraughted with no other Ballast, nor Burden, but Soveraignitie, and their Hornes still sounding on high, the trebble tune onelie of Lordes Paramont, and Vniversall Seignorie.
                  
                  And if the Nicene Fathers haue beene too niggardlie disposed, by

passing a Sentence, of confyning those Romane bishops, within their owne Circuites, agaynst anie such boundlesse, and vniversall Supremacie: then, the VVorlde must knowe, that shee is not so destitute of Lovers, but that shee hath her Favourites, which can mende their Fault; and lyke Picke-Lockes, with wrong Keyes, release their holie Mother, from such narrowe Imprisonment, and can make Canons before hande, to bee vrged in due tyme, by their pope Zozimus, and to giue such an hard Charge,A Canon of Nice, counterfeyt. to a whole Africane Councell, as they shall bee in hope, that those shall yeelde presentlie, to such a braue Batterie. VVhich if that fayle them (as vnluckilie it did) and that Paper onelie bee found in the shot, in place of hard Bullet; Then shall bee made vp, two famous counterfeyt Councels: the one where-of, shall bee a Romane, (and there-fore no marvell, if in Favours of Rome)

which shall checke Nice,

                  And, as yet, the Pope not contenting with this, Boniface the eight, there-fore, doeth steppe farthest of all, and maketh the highest Reach: So that their owne FASCICULUS TEMPORUM testifyeth

of him, Quod in tantam arrogantiam erexit seipsum, ut Dominum totius Mundi se diceret tam in Temporalibus, quam in Spiritualibus: that is, He rose vp, vnto so high pryde, that hee called him-selfe, Lord over the whole VVorlde, as well in Temporall thinges, as in Spirituall. And which Clayme, himselfe, in his large Decretall,

                  Againe, Pope Gelasius had a notable Epistle, against the mutilation of the SACRAMENT, and is cited by Gratian: But what doeth Bellarmine freelie confesse heere-of?

That it were not in the Worlde at all, or were perished: because it is such a cleare Evidence, of the learned opposition, that was made eight hundreth yeares agoe to Transsubstantiation, when it was but hatching, as no clearer anie wayes can bee.
                  And in like manner, in the matter of Divorce, and priviledge of the partie vvronged, to marrie againe, Gratian citeth a Canon of an auncient Councell:

de Castro sawe it in his tyme; but that the same is nowe quyte abolished, and taken away, hee freelie confesseth.
                  Besides those Suppressions of Evidences, what Oppressions lykewyse haue beene of the persons of the good and Godlie, vnder Papacie prevayling, since the eight hundreth yeare of GOD, let their owne Platina, in the lyfe of Sylvester the thirde, and their owne Fasciculus, after the lyfe of Steven the fift, testifie: the one recording, That all good Men suffered Oppression, and Rejection: and the other telling of such Persecution, that hee sayeth, Eia! Quis conventus, quae Congregatio, quis Homo jam securus erit? that is, Alace! what Companie, what Assemblie, yea, what Man nowe, can bee safe? And there-fore, hee calleth that Age where-of hee spake, The vvorst Tyme that ever was, In quo defecit Sanctus, (sayth hee) &amp; diminutae
