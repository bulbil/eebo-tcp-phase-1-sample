            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

why are older men better keepers of their Church then young

men by their ſinnes with the younger Sonne,Luke. 15. 13. who went farre
from his father, are farther off from God, the farther they thinke
in regard of their youth, they are from their end. They are as
proud of the healthfull eſtate of their bodies, as Nabuchadonozar

ouerwhelming the whole earth (a handfull of ſeede as it were

                  ••
               ed to renue the ſame againe,) with riuers of waters.Gen. 6. 14. 17.
And the latter is to be looked for that he waſte the worlde againe
with riuers of fire and brimſtone.Luke 17. 26.
               2. Pet. 3. 6. 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Chriſt in many places is plaine
in this point. Heauen &amp; earth ſhall paſſe away,
               Matt. 5. 18. and ch. 34. 35. 
               but my words
ſhall not paſſe away. In the reedition of a Parable the effect
thereof elſewhere is thus deliuered. The Harueſt is the ende of
the world:
               Matth. 13. 39. verſe 49. 
               So ſhall it be in the ende of this world. And in the
49, verſe of that Chapter, the ſame wordes are repeated. The 25.
Chapter of Matthews Goſpell handleth no other Argument, but
it is Doomes dayes diſcourſe altogether.Matth. 25. It is the gracious promiſe
Chriſt hath giuen to his Church:Matt. 28. 20.

            The ſecond Chapter.
            Of the maner how the world ſhall be
deſtroied.
            
               IT being concluded in the former chapter that the
world ſhall be deſtroied, order would we ſhould
ſet downe how it is to bee deſtroied: which ſhall
bee the ſubiect &amp; argument of this chapter; which
wee will ſpend vpon theſe two parts. 1. The
firſt ſhall determine in what ſorte it ſhall periſh.
            2. The ſecond ſhall giue deciſion to this queſtion, whether
the ſame in ſubſtance or forme ſhall ſo periſh. About the firſt there

               ing it to the depth of y• waters of Noah which drowned
the earth. Such thinges deliuereth Auſtine in his twentieth
booke of the Citie of God in the 18. chapter. Yet in the 16. chapter
of that booke he ſemeth to denie that a man may haue any certaine
knowledge therein but by the eſpeciall certificate of the ſpirite.
Wherein hee is in the right and of the ſurer ſide, for it is ſafer for
vs to hold this modeſtie then to be ouer buſie with the ſecrets of
Gods ſanctuary.1. Peter. 3. 7. &amp;c. It is enough that we ſimplie beléeue (as Peter
teacheth) that the worlde ſhall bee fixed. 1. To ventilate and examine,
of what kind of nature this fire ſhould be. 2. From whence
it ſhould be brought 3. How the ſaints ſhall be preſerued in that
flame, &amp; liue as the Salamander in the fire. 4. How high this fier
ſhal mount we leaue to the wil &amp; prouidēce of God, being contented
to be wiſe with ſobrietie and not affecting to know more then
God wold haue vs, or to compel the ſcriptures that are willing to
go part of y• way with vs▪ to go after the vagaries of our idle luſts.
It ſerueth to the confirmation of the preſent cauſe, namly to the illuſtratiō
of the maner of the worlds diſſolution, that which Math:
hath in theſe words:Math 25 6. 
               At midnight there was a cry made, Behold

when they call one vpon another to goe to their tackling: for it
muſt needs be a cry out of cry that muſt waken the dead, and raiſe
them from their graues. But another part of the cry is the ſtridor
and noiſe that Peter mentioneth which this fier that ſhal conſume

            We come to the ſecond part of this Chapter, which anſwereth
the queſtion, whether the ſubſtance or forme of the worlde
ſhall periſh. For hereof are two opinions ſcattered. 1 Some
are of that minde, that in verie ſubſtance it ſhall be turned vpſide
downe, faſtning vpon theſe Scriptures, as of that in the
Pſalme:Iſal, 102. 25. 
               Thou haſt aforetime laid the foundation of the earth,
and the heauens are the workes of thine hands.
               Heb. 1. 10, 11 12. 
               They ſhall periſh,
but thou ſhalt indure, &amp;c. As of that ſaying of the Prophet
Iſaiah,
               Iſai. 65. 17. and 66. 22. 
               For loe I will create new heauens, and a new earth,
               Reuel. 
                     •
                  1. 1. 
               and
the former ſhall not be remembred, nor come into mind:
               1. Pet 3. 13. as of
that which Saint Iohn in his Reuelation ſaith: And I ſawe a
new heauen, and a new earth; for the firſt heauen, and the firſt
earth were paſſed away, and there was no more ſea. Finally, in
that the Angell ſweareth by him that liueth for euer, that Time
ſhall be no more. Now if time be taken away, all motion muſt
be taken away. If all motion be taken away, there is nothing
in the world that can continue. 2 But otherſome hold, that only
but ſome parts of the worlde ſhall bee ouerturned at the ſecond
comming of Chriſt, not altogither raiſed from their foundation
                  •
               :
but ſo as they ſhall ſuffer a ſingular alteration. Ambroſe taketh
part with this ſide and ſetteth his hande to this opinion,1. Cor. 7. 31. vrging
that which the Apoſtle Paul ſaith: The faſhion of this worlde
goeth away: proſſing the word which he calleth the faſhion, ſhadow,
or forme, and not the maſſe, matter, ſubſtance. That authoritie
of Peter alſo fauoureth that part, in theſe wordes. Wherefore
the worlde that then was,
               2. Pet. 3. 6. 
               periſhed, ouerflowed with the
water: when as but the lower parts thereof were corrupted by
the waters.Apoc. 21. 1. That of the Reuelation preiudiceth not the point:
For there ſeemeth rather a new heauen, and newe earth to be deſtroyed,
then a diſſolution of the other to be inſinuated. Alſo in
Iſaiah it is ſaid That the Moone ſhall haue the light of the Sun,Iſai. 3
                     •
                  . 
                     •
                  6
               
and that the Sunne ſhall yeeld ſeuen fold more light then it doth
now. The Schoolemen applie all inferences in this caſe to the
qualities, and not to the ſubſtance of the world: for the nature of
the world ſhall not ſo be turmoſted,Rom. 8. 20. 21, &amp;c. as it ſhall bee brought to nothing:
but it ſhall be reſcued and redeemed from the hands of var
                  •
               tie,
vnto which it was ſubiect. For the world being ſentenſed to
this iudgement for the ſinne of man, not of it ſelfe ſinning againſt
God: after that ſinne is out of place, the world muſt recouer his
former dignitie, when the time appointed is accompliſhed, eſpecially
the lower bodies which are in the ſubl

                     〈◊〉
                   Dei. The maſter of the
Sentences in effect deliuereth thus much: But hee borroweth
that which hee hath herein from Auſtine, who ſaith, That by a
worldly combuſtion the qualities of the corruptible elements
which had ſome cognation and correſpondencie with our corruptible
bodies ſhall vtterly burne and periſh, and that the ſubſtance
ſhall put on thoſe qualities by a miraculous exchange, which ſhal
be agreeable with the cōdition of immortal bodies, that the world
being altred to the better, may bee fitting to the perſons alſo in
their bodies altred to the better. In the 14. Chapter of the forenamed
booke, this is his verdit. This world ſhall paſſe away by
a mutation, not finall ſubuerſion. And he alledgeth for himſelfe
the fore-cited ſaying of Paul,
               1. Cor. 7. 31 Lib. de dogma. 
                     〈◊〉
                  . 
               The faſhion of this world paſſeth
away: The figure (ſaith he) not the nature is ſpoken of by the
Apoſtle elſe where, he likewiſe ſaith: we are not to beléeue, that the
Elements, that is to ſay, that heauen and earth are to be produced
to aſhes, but that their propertie ſhall be bettered. The ſcriptures
no where ſhew the diſſolution of the worlds ſubſtance. Alſo the
bodies of the Saints muſt be in a place: but what place ſhall they
haue, if they haue not a place in the worlde? Moreouer, man for
whoſe ſinne all woe came vpon the world, ſhall not vtterly be deſtroyed,
but ſhall be renued in bodie, and inueſted with immortalitie,
either to his endleſſe felicitie, or miſerie: wherefore the
worlds compoſition that was not in the tranſgreſſion ſhall much
leſſe comein ſubſtance to this vtter confuſion. But this being a
point more doubtfull then profitable, we leaue it arbitrable: what
ſhall be the ende of the world, we ſhall beſt know in the end of the
world.
            
               
Thus hauing inſiſted as much as neede requireth in the two
propounded points of this Chapter, we will giue the vſe, the life
of the whole, and ſo conclude the ſame.
            Whereas the fire is to conſume this worlde as ſtubble as the
former world was licked vp by water:2. Pet. 3. 7. 11. 12. wee ſee how euery thing,
howſoeuer ſimplie of it owne nature,Gen. 7. 20. appertaineth moſte to the
neceſſarie vſe of man, hath a moſt hurtfull effect againſt man,
when God will take it vp as a rod in his hand, either for the correction,
or deſtruction of man. The fire, the water, the ſoile, the

and kinde whereby we liue, moue, and haue our being: but
when God otherwiſe diſpoſeth of them, and purpoſeth the diuerſion
of their nature, they are poſting Purſeuants of the wrath of
God to execute his iudgements,Gen. 19 24. Gen 7. 20. Num. 16. 31. 32. 33. 34. Num. 11. 16. 33. to the ouerthrow of our liues.
Wherefore the fire went out from Gods preſence to burne vp
Sodom and her Cities. The water, the Beeſom of his fierce anger,
drowned (reſeruing onely eight perſons) y• whole world of the
vngodly. The earth whereupon euery one treadeth, opened and
diſtended her mouth like hell, and ſwallowed vp Dathan, and coneted
the congregation of Abiram. Manna the daintie reſtauration
of the Iſraelites, burſt out of their noſes, and ſauoured abhominably,
as a moſt iuſt iudgement againſt their palpable and
damnable vngratefulneſſe. The ſonnes of the Prophets, by a
ſower hearbe in their pottage,

Meteor by which we liue, being the ſpirit of life and as it were a
fanne in the hand of God, for the clarifying the ayre that it ſhould
not putrifie (an the Lungs in ſtead of Bellowes are giuen to the
heart, to qualifie the exceſſiue heare of the heart) driued Ionas into
the depth of the ſea.

which we rather call an immutation then
corruption, and a tranſlation from a w

               rſer to a
better condition: like as when we of children become
men: of men, old men, we are not deſtroyed
but changed in nature: the fire not conſuming the
world, but reſtoring it: as the fire conſumeth not the gold, but
refineth it: by the methode of the place, it would bee conſidered
concerning the time of the duration thereof, what is to bee determined,
wherein wee will deſire to knowe no more then the
Scriptures haue reuealed: From whence we haue no certaintie,
but rather the vncertaintie is euerie where ſpoken of. As where
Chriſt ſaith:Matth. 24. 36. 
               Of that day and houre knoweth no man, no not
the Angels of heauē, but my father only. In Mark he excepteth
againſt himſelfe to leaue the high knowledge thereof onely to
his father:Mar. 13. 32. 
               Neither the ſonne himſelfe, ſaue the father. Which
is to be vnderſtoode of his humanitie: which naturally and ordinarily
knoweth nothing 
                  •
               erein: but as it is taught by a better
ſchoolmaſter namely his Diuinitie. When the Apoſtles put forth
the queſtion to Chriſt:

ſaith vnto Heſychius, who was curiouſly inquiſitiue of the
worldes end, That he dare not giue the aduenture to meaſure the
length and the ſcope theref, ſeeing the Angels and Sonne of man
himſelfe are ignorant hereof. But in his firſt 
                  •
               ocke vppon Geneſis
againſt the Manichies, hee giueth ſixe ages to the life of
the worlde, as the life of man is diſpoſed, and diuided into ſeuerall
ſundrie ages, through which as his life paſſe, ſo the life
of the worlde goeth away. By caſting the worlde into ſire,
ages, hee followeth the ſet number of dayes which were ſire,
wherein the whole forme and frame of heauen and earth were
made and finiſhed. The firſt age is the time from Adam to
Noah, or to the ſtood, which hee compareth to our infancie.
The ſeconde is, all the time from the flood to Abrahams
dayes, which hee likeneth to our childehoode. The third
is, all the time from Abraham to Dauid, which he ſuteth to
our youthfull age. The fourth is, all the time from Dauid to
the tranſportation of the people into Babylon, which is anſwerable
to our mans eſtate. The fift is, all the time from the captiuitie
to the Incarnation of Chriſt, which hath reference is
our olde age. The ſixt is, all the time from Chriſt, to the
verie ende it ſelfe,Iohn. 2. 18. which is our decrepit eſtate and condition,
which is called by Saint Iohn, The laſt houre. After which
followeth the ſeauenth day, euen the Sabboth of our endleſſe
reſt.
            But in regarde of the notable chaunges thereof, the worlde
may be drawne to a narrower roome, and more ſimplie be deſtributed
into foure ages onely. The firſt is the time from the
Creation to the Flood, which wee may rightly tearme the infancie
and Child-hoode of the worlde,Gen. 4. 21. 22. &amp;c. Gen. 4. 26. Gene. 3. 15. Exo. 12 &amp; 13. &amp; 16. &amp; 20. &amp;c. Exod. 28. 21. 2
                     •
                  . Exo. 18. 5. 18. for that theu Artes were
firſt founde out, and that with the firſt principles and promiſes
of ſaluation the godly were ſatiſfied, and they worſhipped
God after a ſimple and plaine manner. The ſecond, from the
Flood extendeth it ſelfe to the promulgation and publication of
the Lawe, which for verie good cauſes wee may woorthily
call the youthfull age of it. For then were men, farre and wide
diuided throughout all partes of the earth: Common-wealths
were firſt founded, and the beginning of the firſt Monarchie

inſtituted, and the couenant of ſaluation by God with Abraham
our father indented, the linage and deſcent of the Meſſiah
deſigned,Exo. 13. 3. 1
                     •
                  
                and our vniuerſall redemption in the deliuerance
of the Iſraelites from the Egyptian thraldome, typicallie repreſented.
The thirde age comprehendeth the whole time
that was ſpent vnder the time of the Lawe, vnto the comming
of our Sauiour in the fleſh, as wee finde it diuided by our
Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe,Mat. 11. 1
                     •
                  
                ſaying: The Lawe and the Prophets
are vnto Iohn, &amp;c. That was the ripe age and manhoods
of the Worlde, it being then come to his perfect growth,
for then came in Magna Charta, the plenarie enrolment of
the will of God, making the conſignement of the promiſes of
God, by ſundrye Ceremonies, and opening them at large
by the Commentaries of the Prophets. Nowe as ſorrowes
encreaſe with yeares, and the full age hath fulneſſe of troubles
accompanying it: ſo manie perturbations did fall vppon
theſe tymes, and the whole worlde was, as it were ſet vppon
Wheeles, and vp and downe rolled with tragicall comm
                  •
               
               tions.
The fourth age ranne vppon the necke of this, wherein
the Senne of God, in fleſh was manifeſted, which to the conſummation
of the worlde ſhall be continued. This (as wee noted
before out of Iohn) is called The laſt houre,
               1. Iohn 2. 18. Gal. 4. 4. otherwiſe called
by the Apoſtle Paul to the ſame effect: The fulneſſe of time:
ſo tearmed, becauſe all the promiſes of God (excepting the generall
reſurrection, and iudgement) are abſolutely fulfilled, and
ſhall make a full end of the Worlde. Nowe it agreeth ful
                  •
               ie
with the nature of olde age. For as olde men can not liue long,
(though young men may die ſoone) and they ſpende their remainder
of time, with cares infirmityes, and diſeaſes enough:
ſo wee can not promiſe to the worlde beeing in his
olde age any long continuance, or that it ſhall bee better then
it is, but rather that the age of it ſhall bee more burdenſome
vnto it, and make it to be worſſer. This knowledge howſoeuer
ſufficient for vs, ſatiſfieth not others foliſhly curious, ayming
at the verie exact time of his diſſolution, by theſe

               Auguſtine anſwereth them thus, the Lords comming ſhal not
be vntill the Goſpell be diſperſed throughout the world: But how
ſoone he ſhal come after this is thus publiſhed, it is not from hence
gathered. The Goſpel was generally notified to the world in the
Apoſtles time, who by their cōtinual tedious perambulations had
ſent the ſound thereof into all lands,Rom. 10. 18. Pſal. 19. 4 Col. 1. 6. as Paul in his letter to the
Coloſſians writeth thus. Which is come vnto you euen as it is
vnto all the world, and is fruitful, as it is alſo among you: and
yet euer ſince the world hath continued. But there are many relie
vpon idle dreames as vpon familiar deuiles. The Mathematicians
doe looke for a great yeere, as Cicero ſheweth, after which
al the ſtarres ſhal returne to their beginnings, and then the end of
the world ſhal be. Baldus in Cicero, putteth in this ſpoake, This
conuerſion howe long it will bée is a great queſtion: but it is
neceſſarily certaine and definite. Macrobius out of the opinion
of naturall philoſophers doth ſet downe a great yeere, which hee
calleth the worldes yeere. Making it to confiſt of fiftéene thouſand

and the neighbour Cities were burnt to Aſhes, but this
iudgement was formerly denounced by Loth. He brought his
vengeance and fierce wrath vppon Pharaoh. but hee had faire
warning thereof by Moſes aforehand. Thus God threatneth

waxed very hot, the Romaines being at ciuil wars among thē

euery one catching his fellow by the head, &amp; thruſting his

conſumed with fire.Matth. 24. 7. 3 Plague. 4 Famine, are indiuided companions

hee hath conſumed thee from the land. The heauie ſtroke of
Gods hand herein have diuers parts of this our land of late yeres
gréeuouſly felt. Concerning ſamme, it was ſo fierce and fearefull
in Heiruſalem as many died of it, of which Ioſephus writeth.

                5 It
is enough that Earthquakes are foretold though there be no further
inrolement either of the place or of the time:Matth. 24. 7. yet Ioſephus
maketh relation of ſome things agréeing with this prediction.

                  . Cap. 12. there was a ſtarre ouer the Citie ſéene
like vnto a ſword: at nine in the night, a light greater thē the daylight
ſhined in the Temple, which continued halfe an houre. In
the ayre were ſeene armed ſoldiors ſkirmiſhing together, and a
voice in the Temple was heard. Let vs depart hence: But wée
néede not wander ſo farre for proofe of ſuch prodigies. The Earthquake
that hapned in the yéere 1580. on the ſixt of April, that ſhaked
not only the ſcenicall Theatre, but the great ſtage and Theatre
of the whole land verifieth Chriſts prediction. 6 A Catholique
corruption in maners and conuerſation, being another

marke of knowledge of the worlds conſumption, hath béene long
and is ſtill really, and ſubſtancially in action. And becauſe iniquitie
ſhall be increaſed, the loue of many ſhall be cold. This
prophecy took place in Chriſts time, whē he came among his own,Iohn. 1. 11. Mark. 14. 43. Luk. 22. 47.
but his owne knewe him not. When Iudas betraied him, Peter
forſware him, &amp; al his other followers perſidiouſly did forſake him.

which dulleth the mind, enféeble the body, diſable the whole

headie, high minded, louers of pleaſures more then louers of

be concluded in this totall and generall ſumme in the ſentence of
our Sauiour,Luk 18. 8. 
               When he cōmeth he ſhal ſcarce find faith vpon
the earth. If this be not as clere as the Sunne, let any man goe
with creſſet &amp; torch light from the center to the circumferice, &amp; find
me out a man, in whom ſome of theſe properties is not proper, that
walketh éeuenly both with God &amp; man without any imputatiō of
reproofe, to diſproue and checke this aſſertion. 8 The eight token
of the end of the world which is the preaching of the Goſpell
through the whole world, according to that which Chriſt ſayth:
This Goſpel of the Kingdome muſt be preached through the
whole world for a witneſſe to all nations,
               Matt. 24. 14. Mark. 13. 10. 
               and then ſhall the
end come. Theſe wordes of our Sauiour being rightly vnderſtoode,
hath had his vertue and effect. For when perſecution began
to bee in Hieruſalem, and the D
                  •
               ſciples were driuen from
thence,Act 8. 2. 3. 4. 9. 19. they went preaching throughout all Iudea, and went
from thence into Samaria, and illuminated that place with the
light of the Goſpell, where Philip conuerted Queene Candaces
Chamberlaine the Aethiopian, by whoſe meanes, no doubt, the

in the ſcriptures, are often contracted, and implie an vniuerſalitie
that is definite, as in theſe places: All fleſh ſhall ſee the
ſaluation of God.
               1. Tim. 2. 4. Againe, They ſhal be all taught of God. Alſo
God will that all men ſhall be ſaued, which is to be vnderſtood
(as Auguſt ſaith) of all that are ſaued: for they are ſaued by the
will of God But the greateſt matter that they haue to oppoſe againſt
this point, is the ſaying of our Sauiour:Luke. 18. 
               Do ye thinke that
when then ſonne of man ſhall come, he ſhall find faith in earth?
But, ſay they, If there ſhall bee ſuch a popular conuerſion vnto
Chriſt, there remaineth much faith vpon earth, which Chriſt ſhal
find at his comming. We thus eaſily diſſolue this doubt, and reconcile
theſe repugnant places in appearance.2. Theſ. 2. 3. 1. Sam. 19. 13. Of the principles of their faith, ſwaruing from the truth. See D. Reinolds 5. concluſion, inlarged. An 1602. For Antichriſt
hath turned al religion vp-ſide downe, inſomuch as the principles
of their faith no more fit the right faith, then the counterfeite
that Michell placed vpon the pillow, was like vnto Dauid: ſo
that if it were poſſible, the elect ſhould be ſeduced, but being ſmit
through by the ſworde of the Spirit of Chriſt: The Iewes may
well returne and acknowledge their Meſſiah, and confirme and
eſtabliſh the ſeduced Gentiles: wee alſo anſwere thus, that after
this vniuerſall conueonrſt of the world anew, Apoſtacie and
ſecuritie may follow, which may quench the fire of the ſpirit,
and ſo they may bee relapſed a freſh into their former filthineſſe,
which ſhall bee the cauſe that God ſhall abridge, and ſhorten
the worldes age for his elects happines.

2 The ſeconde of the laſt two ſignes of the worldes ende,
is the manifeſtation of Antichriſt, of which Paul ſpeaketh,
ſaying: This day of Chriſt ſhall not come before there
bee a departure firſt, and that man of ſinne be diſcloſed, euen
the ſonne of perdition, which is Antichriſt. This
ſigne is alreadie giuen, for the Pope is this huge and abſolute

Antichriſt, in the iudgement of Pope. For Gregorie the eight
of that name Pope of Rome in the yéere of our Lord 602. willed
vs to take this for an infallable marke of Anti-chriſt, the
name of vniuerſall Biſhop, and whoſoeuer ſhall arrogate that
title to himſelfe, hee concludeth him to be Antichriſt. But
fiue yeeres after, Boniface ſucceeding him, was by Phocas the
Emperour called Vniuerſall Biſhop. And euer ſince euerie
following Pope continueth the title. By conſequence then it
is manifeſt that at Rome is the Antichriſt: who ſo liſteth further
to be ſatiſfied in this point, let him reade the learned booke of
Doctor Whittakers againſt Sanders ſortie demonſtrations in
this caſe: and a ſet homelie of Gualters to this purpoſe: and a
late booke of Doctor Downams,
               D. Downam his treatiſe of Antichriſt, publiſhed An. 1603. and many others that haue laboured
in this buſines to aſſoile at queſtions, and to cleere it of all
further contradiction.
            By this which hetherto hath bene declared, wee may euidently
perceiue if we will not be blind with Balaam with our eyes open,
and groape with the Sodomites for a wall at noone day:
that the worldes beſt daies are ſpente, and that the diſtruction
thereof is at hand.Num. 21. 22. &amp; 23 &amp;c. Gen. 19 11. There is no greater ſigne of a dying man
then when thou feeſt him ſnatch the ſheetes and blankets of the
bedde, and forciblie draw them to himſelfe: but this wee ſee euery
where in the courſe of the world, wherein euery one catcheth
what hee can, drawing other
                  •
                goodes into their handes with cartropes
of couetouſnes, wherein they haue their ſicophantes at
hand to ſooth them in their ſinne, and their oppreſſing iniquitie.
Pharaoh had ſeruants at hand to magnifie Sarahs beauty,Gen 12. 15. thereby
to ſit themſelues to the kings fancie. Another certaine ſigne of
a periſhing bodie is the coldneſſe of the bodie. Therefore it is ſaid
of Dauid when he was towards death, that 
                  •
               e was ſo cold as no
cloathes could heate him:1. King. 1. 1, and ſo for want of heate died. Wherefore
when euery one beginneth to die, his féete, hands, noſe, and
other partes ware cold, vpon ſight whereof his Phiſitions pronounceth
him to be a dead man. This is the ſtate of the preſent
world, wherein charitie is at the coldeſt, and at the laſt gaſpe, hauing
taken farewell of the world: vertue, veritie pittie, piet

which rancle the verie heauens manie thouſand miles of from

vgly and fipthie abhomination. 3. The third and laſt conſideration
we take from hence, is the louing kindnes of God and his vnwillingnes
in puniſhing a ſinner, according to that which Iſai
ſaith. God worketh a ſtrange worke, to bring his owne work
to paſſe. Dij immortales nec volunt nec poſſunt obeſſe.
                The immortal
Gods are neither willing norable to hurt, ſaith Seneca. It
is his propertie alwaies to haue mercie, as it is in the Antheme
of the Church. And iudgement is a ſtrange work vnto him contrarie
to his nature: which hée executeth to make vs owners of
his mercie, which is his owne proper action. If God tooke anie
pleaſure in vndoing the world, and worldly men: he would not
come in this mouing manner to vs, cauſing all the creatures of
heauen to put on blacke garments. But euen as when the maiſter
of the houſe dieth (ſaith Chriſoſtome) all the houſhould is
cladde in mourning wéedes: ſo mankind, for which all the parts
of the world were made to be ſeruants to them, béeing to be done
away, all creatures follow their funeralles with lamentations
in their kindes, the orient Sunne, Moone, ſtaires doe chaunge colour,
and are in blacke array.Math. 24. 29. Mark. 13. 24. A Painter is very loath to marre
the whole proportion of the picture, for ſome defection and imperfection
that is in it: ſo God is very loath, to vndoe al his workmanſhip
in vs, for ſome ſinnes and tranſgreſſions that are in vs.
Many Iudges of Aſſiſe are ſo pittifull, as albeit they are to venounce

the doome of death againſt priſoners at the barre, as they
weepe when they deliuer it: ſo God doth with vs béeing ſentenced
for our vnrepentant ſinnes vnto death. So he wept when hée

                  •
               rowned the firſt world:Gen. 7. Luke 19. 21. 41. 42. Math. 24. 29. ſo he wept for the deſtruction of Hieruſalem,
and this affection hée ſheweth in this habite of heauenlie
creatures, which they do on at the worlds diſſolution. There
is many a hangman, who though he be neuer ſo butcherly bent
will bemoane the eſtate of his freind, eſpecialli

whoſe hand or eare he is to cut off: Therefore God that loueth
vs more then the father can the childe, or the huſband the wife,
cannot but be reſolued into paſſions for our condemnation. This
doctrine you haue often heard, but yée do but litle heede it, happily
becauſe yee doe not beleeue it is ſo at hand. But theſe ſignes hitherto
ſpoken of maketh it out of doubt. The king doth purpoſe
to remooue from one Court to another: and when report goeth of
it, many doubt of it, becauſe the prince many times doth delay
the time, but when the furniture of the Court is taken downe,
then euery one knoweth that he remoueth out of hand:1. Pet. 4. 
                     •
                  . ſo it hath
béene often preached in your eares, that the end of the world is at

ſecond. A double death anſwereth this double reſurrection. 1.
The firſt death, which is of the vnrepentant ſoule. 2. The ſecond
which is euerlaſting death, the condition of the damned. We
learne of the Scriptures thus to diſtinguiſh of the reſurrection.
For the firſt and ſecond reſurrection, The firſt and ſecond death
are mentioned in holy ſcriptures.
                  
                     〈◊〉
                  . 20. 6. As by Iohn in the Reuellation:
Bleſſed, and holy is he, that hath part in the firſt reſurrection:
For on ſuch the ſecond death hath no power: But they
ſhall be the Prieſts of God and of Chriſt. and ſhall raigne with
him a thouſand yeeres. Where Iohn by the firſt reſurrection
vnderſtandeth the reſurrection of the minde from ſinne to repentance.
In the Goſpell of Iohn both theſe reſurrections are ſpoken
of together:Ioh. 5. 25. 28, 2
                     •
                  . 
               The houre ſhall come and now is, when the
dead ſhall heare the voice of the ſonne of God, Theſe wordes
belong to the firſt reſurrection, and that doth the courſe of them
declare, in that hée ſaith: The hower ſhall come and nowe is.
For no man will ſay that the hower of the latter reſurrection was
then. By the dead therefore that ſhould haue liued, if they had
had faith in Chriſt and beléeued: hée meaneth ſuch who by means
of their ſinnes, are without ſpiritual life: of whom Chriſt in an
other place,Math. 8. 22. Epheſ. 2. 1. 2 3 ſaith Let the dead burie the dead. The like death is
named by Saint Paul: You hath he quickned, that were dead
in treſpaſſes and ſinnes. In his letter to Timothie, he ſpeaketh
of a liuing dead widow in the former ſenſe: She that liueth in
pleaſure is dead while ſhe liues.
               1. Tim. 5. 6. Col. 2. 13. We were all of vs in this ſtate
of death before our iuſtification by faith: Firſt by our original ſin,
and then by our actuall ſinnes, which we haue committed ſince of
our owne frée will: wherefore it is more then néedefull for vs
thus to riſe from the dead. The bleſſed onely ſhare in this reſurrection.
In the latter reſurrection the commons common with vs,
as Chriſt ſheweth in his wordes of the latter reſurrection:

                  eue. 21. 3. 24 27. 
               Marueile
not at this: for the houre ſhall come in the which all that
are in the graues, ſhall heare his voice. And they ſhall come
foorth that haue done good vnto the reſurrection of life, but
they that haue done euill, vnto the reſurrection of condemnation.
But this firſt reſurrection as not falling into my purpoſe I
minde not to meddle with.
            
               
In the handling of the reſurrection,1. Cor. 15. 12 13 21 29 30, 32 34 35, 36 38, 43. we haue in hand, we will
firſt conclude the certaintie thereof againſt all gaine-ſaying aduerſaries.
For the point is much puſhed at with the point of Sophiſticall
allegations, which without difficultie we will do away
well inough. This Article hath béene exagitated by many, and
many wayes oppugned. The Philoſophers as abſurde doe renounce
it: And there haue beene found too many in the Church
who haue denied it. The Peripaticians as almoſt all the ſects of
P
                  •
               iloſophers haue behaued themſelues moſt rudely in this buſineſſe.
The diuinitie that the ſchoole of Epicures profeſſeth in
this point, is this. There is nothing that remaineth after death.
Seneca, though he be a friend to the principle of the immortalitie
of the ſoule, yet he is ſo groſſe, as to auouch that all things are determined
and ended by death. For writing vnto Martia, hee
ſ
                  •
               ith: Mors omnium eſt ſolutio &amp; finis, vltra quam mala noſtra non
exeunt. Death is the reſolution and period of all things, which
bounds our euils cannot exceede.
                Againe, this is another of his
proper Aphoriſmes. Non poteſt e
                     ••
                  e miſer qui nullus eſt. He cannot
be a wretched man that is no man.
                In theſe darkeneſſe lay almoſt
all the rabblement of the Orators, Philoſophers, and Poets
of the Gentiles. And if we ſhall ranſacke the militant Church,
we ſhall find many monſtrous minded men in this matter. Among
the Iewes, the Sadduces diſclaimed the reſurrection, whom
Chriſt tooke to taſke in the Goſpel, and daunted thoſe triumphing
Hannibals moſt notablie.
            The Apoſtles times brought forth Hymenaes,
               Mat. 22. 23. 2. Tim. 2. 16. 17 18 and Philetus,
ſuch companions of the ſame aſſociation. Of this ſchoole was Simon
Magus of whom the Heretiques Simoniani were named,
with whom combined in this naſtie opinion, the eluiſh route of
Valentinians, Carpocratians, Cardonians, Arcontici, Seueria

Baſilidans, Hierarchites, &amp;c. The Manichees likewiſe come
ſtuffling in among them, abſolutely gain-ſaying the reſurrection
of the bodie, but maintaining the reſurrection of the ſoule, by the
preaching of the truth, againſt whom Auguſtine diſputeth. The
Hereſie of theſe men we will remoue and doe away by Scriptures,
before which all ſuch lewd aſſertions muſt fall, as Dagon
before the Arke. The whole conſent of the olde Teſtament conf

them, and the doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles confoundeth

them, and naturall reaſon agreeth thereunto, and is earneſt
againſt them. This orderly and curſortly we will conſider of. We
proue the reſurrection, and reſtitution of the ſame indiuided bodie
in the ſame ſubſtance, all infirmitie and deformitie taken away,
the mightie ſpirit of God to be repaired at the latter day, &amp; made
like the glorious bodie of his Maieſtie. Iob hath a peculier proofe
hereof in this his ſimple and open formall profeſſion:Iob 14. 12. Iob. 19. 35. &amp;c 
               I am ſure that
my Redeemer liueth, and he ſhall ſtand the laſt on the earth.
And though after my skinne wormes deſtroy this body, yet
ſhal I ſee God in my fleſh, whō I my ſelfe ſhal ſee, &amp; mine eies
ſhal behold, and none other for me, though my reines are conſumed
within me. The ſame is not obſcurely ſhadowed vnto vs
in the drie bones which at the prophecie of Ezechiel at the commandement
of God vpon them receiued breath of life,Ezech. 37. 8. had their
ſinews iunctures, and perfect compoſition. Daniel auoucheth as
much ſaying:Dan. 12. 2. 
               Many of them that ſleepe in the duſt of the earth,
ſhall awake, ſome to euerlaſting life, &amp; ſome to ſhame and perpetuall
contempt. The prophet Iſai goeth hand in hand with the
reſt,Iſai. 26. 19. ſaying: Thy dead men ſhal liue, euen with my bodie ſhall
they riſe. Dauid witneſſeth ſo much in this wiſe:Pſal. 17. 15. 
               But I will behold
thy face in righteouſnes &amp; when I awake, I ſhall be ſatiſſied
with thine image. The practiſe and probate hereof in the widows

                  . Acts 23. 8. Iohn 14. 19. are alſo proofs pregnant enough of the generall
reſurrection to come. Chriſt in many places of the new inſtrument
concludeth as much, as when he ſaith: The houre commeth,
&amp; is how, when the dead ſhal heare the voice of the ſon
of God: as when againſt the Saduces hee is peremptorie in this
point, thus arguing againſt thē: God is not the God of the dead
but of the liuing: but God is the God of Abraham, Iſaac, and
Iacob who are dead: from hence is this neceſſary deduction, they
muſt riſe againe: as when he ſaid to his diſciples, I liue &amp; ye ſhall
liue. Alſo to the further illuſtration of this doctrine, do theſe places
appertaine: It ſhalbe eaſier for them of the land of Sodome and
Gomorrah in the day of iudgement then for that City: which
inference is repeated in y• next chap. The ſon of man ſhal come in
the glory of his father with his Angels,

yéeldeth this reaſon:Luk 14. 14. 
               Thou ſhalt be recōpenced at the reſurrection
of the iuſt. The Apoſtles with one mouth preach the ſame
doctrine. Paul bringeth in cluſters of arguments in the caſe. 1 He
reaſoneth from the confeſſion of the Corinth.

that the reſurrection is moſt ſure.1. Cor. 15. 1

thus: Chriſt is riſen from the dead, therefore we ſhall riſe from

to that head: The antecedeut and forepart of the argument
is accompanied by ſundrie conſequences in the following

of his firſt Letter to the Corinthians. Vpon which ſubiect hée

God, that the reſurrection of the dead which they themſelues
looke for alſo, ſhall bee both of iuſt and vniuſt. Of the reſurrection
of the dead am I accuſed of you this day. Peter in ſundrie
places witneſſeth the reſurrection, as when he ſaith: Which

Chapter of his laſt Epiſtle, is nothing elſe but illuſtration of this
Article. S. Iohn deliuereth like diuinitie thus: We know that

bookes were opened, and another booke was opened, which
was the book of life, and the dead were iudged of thoſe things
which were written in the bookes, according to their workes.
And the Sea gaue vp her dead which were in her, and death
and hell deliuered vp the dead which were in them, and they
were iudged euerie man according to their works. In the next
Chapter we haue this diſcourſe,

vnto vs: God ſhall wipe away all teares from their eies; and
there ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow, neither crying,
neither ſhall there be any more paine. Saint Iames auoucheth
as much ſaying: Be patient vnto the comming of the Lord. Be
patient and ſettle your heart, for the comming of the Lorde
draweth neere. the Authour of the Epiſtle to the Hebrews hath
much good matter in the behalfe of the reſurrection. In the tenth
Chapter, after much diſcourſe appertaining thereunto, he ſummeth

it vp thus: Knowing in your ſelues how that ye haue in
heauen a better and enduring ſubſtance.Heb. 10. 34. Heb. 11. 35. &amp;c. In the next chapter
he ſaith: Others alſo were racked and would not be deliuered,
that they might receiue a better reſurrection.
            Thus haue we the old and new Teſtament on the ſide of this
doctrine, which is ſufficient: but becauſe Atheiſts (who peſter this
land, as the Frogs and Caterpillers did Pharaos Court) doe arraigne
the integritie of the Scriptures,1. Cor. 15. 3
                     •
                   36. 37. 38. and iudge of this matter
by naturall reaſon: it is not amiſſe t
                  •
                ſtop their mouthes by confuting
and confounding them this way. Wherefore we ſet vpon
them thus. 1 The ſoule did not ſinne without the body: therfore
the bodie muſt be puniſhed with it. Therefore the bodie muſt riſe
againe. The Philoſophers doe denie the ſequence, and ſay that it
is enough that the minde bee rewarded according to the actions
thereof, and that it is not néedefull that the bodie which was not
principall but acceſſarie in the ſinne, and only but the inſtrument
to ſerue ſins turne, ſhould partake with the mind. And they ſhew
compariſons for the ſame of Artificers and craftſmen, who for
making a houſe, or any other peece of worke, haue their hire and
couenants, when as the inſtruments wherewith they wrought
are not rewarded, neither are they damnified though the worke
by them be not accordingly performed. Of a poiſoned pot, which
is not therefore diſſolued and broken in péeces, eſpecially if it
be of any price, though many haue drunke their deſtruction out of
it. Of a ſword, which a man will not breake or caſt from him, becauſe
a man hath beene ſlaine with it. But yet by their leaue (who
take theſe ſimilitudes for ſuch ſure ſtuddes) there be many in their
vnſtaied affections, that will daſh in peeces ſuch intoxicated cups,
and breake that weapon againſt a wall, that hath beene the occaſion
of a miſchiefe. But we turne away all the force of ſuch reaſo
                  •
               ing
by diſtinction of inſtruments, as they are of coniunct, and
diuided nature. The bodie (the ſouls inſtrument) is of the firſt difference,
and is conioyned and coupled with the mind: wherfore it
du
                  •
               ly taketh ſuch part as the mind doth. The minde draweth on
the bodie to commit vncleanneſſe: the bodie therefore falleth
thereupon iuſtly into diuers maladies. The mind is diſpoſed to
fel onie, for which the hands and the feete are manacled, and the
necke is hazarded, and the whole bodie vndergoeth the penaltie.

This argument deducted from the rule of Gods iuſtice, pleaſeth
Paul ſo wel as he maketh vſe of it, hauing pro
                  •
               ed the reſurrection.
Therefore my beloued brethren be ye ſtedfaſt,

               vnmoueable, aboundant
alwaies in the worke of the Lord, foraſmuch as ye
know that your labor is not in vaine in the Lord But this labor
commeth both from mind and bodie: therefore the recompence
of the reward ſhalbe giuen vnto them both. 2 Our ſecond Apodicticall
concluſion is this That which is imperfect, hath not capacitie
of abſolute felicitie: but the ſoule ſundred from the bodie is
imperfect, therefore it muſt needes be coupled to the bodie, to the
attainment of this plenarie felicitie. 3 We reaſon alſo thus. The
fulneſſe of Gods goodnes towards thoſe that are his, could not be
ſhewed: nor the fulnes of his furiouſneſſe vpon the wicked could
not be powred, if the reſurrection were not. 4. It ſtandeth God in
hand as much as his truth is worth, to make good the reſurrection
becauſe we haue promiſe and charter of him for it: Chriſt hauing
ſaid it, God ſhall reward you in the reſurrection of the iuſt.
5 That we ſhould not doubt of his truth in ſome examples,Luke 14. at all
t
                  •
               mes he hath made proofe hereof, exempting them frō death, that
the world may know that death is in his hands, ſtanding before
him to execute his will like a Purſeuant, to ſpare and to ſpoile: as
in the time of nature,Gen. 5. 20. 2. Reg. 2. 8. 11. Matt. 28. 6. Marke 16. 1. 8, 5, &amp;c. Ioh 20. 11, &amp;c 2. Reg. 4. 34. 2 Kin. 13. 21. Exod. 4. 3. 6. Gen. 7. Heb. 11. 11. Gen. 21. 7. when he tooke vp Enoch: in the time of the
law when he tooke vp Elias: in the time of grace, when he raiſed
vp Chriſt from death to life. We inforce the matter fuller, and argue
from the leſſer to the greater thus. Elizeus raiſed the Sunamites
ſonne, therefore much more can Chriſt raiſe vs vp. Elizeus
his bones gaue life to a dead bodie: therefore much more ſhall the
omnipotent word of God which is Chriſt, giue li
                  •
               e to our dead
bodies. Aarons rod did bloſſom and beare Almonds. Moſes drie
waſter became a créeping Serpent. Sarah her dead wembe was
deliuered of a ſon: what are theſe but liuely images of the reſurrection?
7 From the order of nature, though we haue no ſtrong
proofe, yet much probable matter we haue of the vndoubted reſurrection.
The day that now paſſeth, to morrow doth returne. Trées
and herbs are ſtroken dead by the violence of the winter, &amp; reuiue
with the ſpring (the renuing time of the yere) and are clothed with
leaues and fruits. But thou wilt ſay to this, that life was not vtterly
out of them by the winters wracke: wee ſay alſo, that by

death man is not vtterly depriued of life, for it is their ſoules that
die not. Such Logicks doth Paul vſe in the corne that is ſowne,
whoſe corruption is the generation of it.1. Cor. 15. 3

ſoweſt is not quickened, except it die. This is that which

Indian bird the Phaenix (as philoſophers do report) &amp; good diuines
do ratifie (eſpecially Lactantius among others) dieth &amp; is waſted to
aſhes by the heat of the Sun, &amp; of thoſe her aſhes is a yong one ingundred,
and thus is that kind continued. This ſimilitude is taken
vp by diuines to illuſtrate our certain reſurrection. For more
cōpanie ſake we name the ſwallows, worms, flies, which lie dead
al the winter, &amp; by y• increaſing heat of the ſun are enliued againe
in the ſpring and ſommer time. If we run through all the rankes
and claſſes of nature, we ſhall finde euerie where probabilities in
the point. Fire that lieth dead in a flint ſtone, by a little force that
is put vnto it, putteth life into it. The Sunne that goeth downe
doth riſe againe: the Moone decreaſeth and increaſeth againe: Our
nailes are paired, and grow againe: our heares are cut off, &amp; come
vp againe. Sleepe (called by Homer the brother of death, and
by others the image of death, becauſe it is the tying of the ſenſes,
as binding them in that wiſe as they cannot execute their functions)
ſeazeth vpon vs, and as it were burieth vs for a time. But
the bodie diſpelleth it againe: after which it is freſh and plyable to
to any office. The miſbeleefe of ſuch, who cannot be brought to
think that out of the putred and conſumed ſtuffe, life ſhould be expreſſed,
are by ſundry works of nature notably conuicted. For of
ſuch confection (or infection rather) are miſe, mouls, frogs, worms,
ingendred. Out of 
                  •
               ooks, cranies, odde corners of the earth, often
very radiant and ſplendent precious ſtones are gathered. The ſéed
of liuing creatures, which is nothing elſe but a drop of miſſhapen
humour, what ſubſtance doth it beget in progreſſe of time?

worke of more difficultie to forme the woman of mans rib, to create
the man of the gleab of the earth, to make the whole frame of
heauen and earth of nothing; then to raiſe vp man from the duſt
to life. If wine be mixed with water, there are thoſe that can part
the wine from the water. Goldſmiths, and ſuch as worke in
mettals,Gen. 1. 1. 3 26 can diſſolue confected ſubſtances, concreate of gold, ſiluer,
braſſe,Gen. 2. 22. ſteele. And ſuch are to be found, who can expreſſe Oyle
and liquide matter out of anie drie bodie: Wherefore the illimited
power of God, which made all things of nothing, ſhall reduce
our bodies to their formes againe, howſoeuer formerly reduced
to nothing. Lengthen out the matter ſo farre as conceit and
imagination will let you, and put the caſe thus: That a man is
eaten by a wolfe; that wolfe is eaten by a lion; that lion is deuoured
by the fouls of the aire; the foules of the are aire eaten by men;
one of thoſe men eate vp another as Canibals doe: yet ſhall his
owne bodie be giuen him againe: euerie man ſhall haue ſo much
matter of his owne, as will ſerue to make him a perfect bodie.
They ſhall haue the ſame bodies in ſubſtance,Iob 19. 27. as Iob ſaieth,

with glorie.Homil. 2. Corinth. Their mouthes ſhall bee opened to ſpeake better
things, their eyes ſhall haue better obiect before them, their
feete ſhall be exalted aboue the cloudes, and the whole bodie
ſhall be mantled with immortalitie, as ſayeth Chryſoſtome. If
to infringe this which hath beene deliuered, any ſhall obiect this
ſaying of the Apoſtle:1. Cor. 15. 50. 
               Fleſh and blood cannot inherite the
Kingdome of God: and ſo inferre hereupon, that the bodies

of men ſhall not riſe againe: we anſwer them thus, that by fleth
and blood is not meant the bodies of men ſimply, but as they are
now in the ſtate of corruption, that which the Apoſtle calleth animale
corpus The fleſhly
                man or the earthly man, and what ſoeuer
is of nature without the ſpirite: which being depraued and corrupted,
muſt needes be renued.Ioh.

vnles a man be regenerate, and borne a new, he cannot
enter into the kingdome of God. The vnregenerate man is
called Fleſh: therefore Chriſt immediatly after the former words
ſaid. That which is borne of the fleſh is fleſh, wherefore of force
wee muſt be regenerated, neither onely the fleſh, the bodie, or a
part of the minde is to be renued, which couetteth and is angry:
but eſpecially the reaſon, the minde, the will. And Chriſt elſe
where teacheth that the whole man as he is in the ſtate of nature
is called fleſh and bloud. For thus Chriſt anſwereth Peter:
Bleſſed art thou Simon Bar Iona for fleſh and bloud hath not
reuealed theſe thinges,

wordes Chriſt comprehendeth the better parts of the mind. For
they be thoſe by which we vnderſtood, and the truth is reuealed
vnto vs. Therefore theſe muſt be turned and tranſpoſed and
created a new, that we may be (as Chriſt ſaith) like the Angells
in reſurrection. For the infirmitie of this mortall bodie is ſuch,
as it cannot take the leaſt taſte or ſmack of heauenly glorie, as we
perceiue in the Prophets and Apoſtles, who were men without
ſoules, when at anie time God did appeare vnto them. And not
without cauſe ſaid God to Moſes, Thou canſt not ſee my face:
neither ſhall man ſee me and liue. Wherefore the German and
right ſence of the wordes of the Apoſtle is this: as we are nothing
elſe but fleſh and bloud, weake, mortall, ſinfull. Curuae in terris animae
coel eſt ium in mes, wée cannot inherite the kingdome of God.

the dead then a beaſt: we will anſwere them by Salomon who
explaineth himſelfe in the words following: they are like in dying,
As the one dieth ſo dieth the other: but in their eſtate after
death they differ, of which Salomon ſpeaketh not.

The Lords aduerſaries ſhall be deſtroied, and out of heauen

            How ioyfull it is to the godly, and dolefull to the wicked,
that Chriſt ſhall be their Iudge.
            
               AS Kinges haue their habits according to the times,
either of warre, mirth, or mourning: So Chriſt ſuteth
himſelfe to the nature and propertie of his buſineſſe:
and comming to iudge the worlde, he cloatheth
himſelfe with the cloudes, as with a garment, and is
decked with maieſtie and honour. He will come flying like a Be

Gentile: but when hee comes againe hee will diuide the ſeruant

Maſter Caluin, to this purpoſe ſpeaketh moſt comfortablie to the
Chriſtian ſoule thus: It is no ſmall ſecuritie, that we are not called
before any iudgement ſeat, but of our redeemers, of whom ſaluation
is to be looked for: ſo farre is he from going vp to the bench
to condemne vs. To this end the Father hath honoured his Son,
and hath reſigned vp to him all the iudgement, for the pacificition

               
                  〈◊〉

               ighted with the regard of the
terror of his iudgement.

thou haſt a good inheritance. For tell me if thou hadſt a cauſe ha

in the law, &amp; thy Counſellor who alwayes hath encouraged
thee in it, ſhould be made thy Iudge, wouldſt thou not bee a glad
man vpon it, and aſcertaine thy ſelfe of thy good ſucceſſe? The
Chriſtians caſe is the like, and our fee-ſimple, and frée-hold of our
ſaluation is to vndergo deciſion and determination of law. Chriſt
that alwayes hath béene our Counſellor and warranted vs the
day is created by the father our Iudge, the inheritance therefore
cocke-ſure of our ſide, and that our ſoules knowe right well. Reſpect
not therefore what iudgement the worlde giueth of thee,
ſeeing thou haſt the ſupreme Iudge of the higheſt Court, that
giueth ſentence on thy ſide, which Omni appellatione remota, without
further appeale muſt ſtande inuiolable. For if thou beeſt
here wronged in a lower Court by ſome vnſkilfull or corrupt
Iudge, thou knoweſt how to remedie the matter out of hand,

                  •
               mely, by appealing to a higher Bench, where this iniuris
is rectified. Art thou thus wiſe for thy worldly wealth, and
wilt thou not haue as good vnderſtanding for thy ſauing health?

nothing worſe: in which reſpect, when they would have honoured

               I will alſo
gather all nations and will bring them downe into the valley
of Iehoſaphat and will pleade with them there for my people
and for mine heritage Iſrael and from other ſuch wordes in the
middle part of that chapter:Verſe 12. 
               Let the heathen be weakned, and
come vp to the valley of Iehoſaphat, for ther wil I ſit to iudge
all the heathen round about. The Iewes with all pertinacie doe
applie this propheſie to temporall things, and dote hereupon, that
the Meſſias ſhall preuaile euer the Gentiles in this valley, and
condemne them; and that afterwarde in the reſurrection of the
righteous he ſhall ſit in the ſame place vpon their finall ſentence,
and that there he ſhall kéepe a ſolemne feaſt with the godly. They
giue out alſo in their head-ſtrong imaginations, that an Oxe is
ſtaked vp for the purpoſe, created and fatted by God to that vſe:
and that the Leuiathan hath béene ſlaine long ſince, and laid in the
powdring tub, and that they ſhall drinke wine fréely out of Paradice.
The valley of Iehoſaphat is called the valley of iudgement,
and it may bee true that at Ieruſalem there was a place of this
name, ſcituated at the Eaſt doore of the Temple: but that is but
the type and ſhadow of the iudgement place of the Lord,Matt. 25. 32. to which
ſhall reſort a greater aſſembly then that valley can receiue. But
we deſire to know no more then is meete for vs, which God hath
reuealed to vs: We liſt not to looke beyond the Moone for myſteries:
As the time of iudgement is onely knowne to God, ſo God
knoweth beſt what place is fitteſt, and what place he will haue
to hold his Aſſiſes in.

with the ancients of his people, and the Princes thereof▪ that
is to ſay, with the elect companie, as Chriſt ſaith to his Apoſtles:
Ye ſhal ſit vpon twelue Thrones,

               and iudge the twelue Tribes
of Iſrael, as Paul ſaith: Know ye not that wee ſhall iudge the
Angels? We anſwer, that iudgement is of double nature: there
is a iudgement of Abſolution: there is another iudgement which
is of Condemnation. In the iudgement of Condemnation are
the wicked only wrapped, adulterers, adultreſſes, fornicators vncleane

but iudgement of Abſolution that is to ſay: they are iudged to
be quit and deliuered, and bleſſed. They ſhall be abſolued of all
the ſlanderous imputatiōs of the world, and wicked men againſt

euerie mans particuler conſcience, which maketh conuulſions &amp;
thinges in vs, and is inſtead of a thouſand witneſſes, ſetting before
vs the thinges that we haue done. The booke of life is the decree
of Gods election, in which God hath ſet downe who are ſealed

vnto euerie man his owne proper ſins, in thought word,
and deede, committed againſt heauen and againſt him, and then
alſo by his omnipotent power, hee that can of ſtones by Iordans
brooke ſide raiſe vp Children to Abraham, ſhall breake a ſunder
our ſtonie conſciences, ſo that wee ſhall haue compunction and remembrance
of all ſorepaſſed actions. Now the conſcience of the
wicked is feared with a hot yron, and is paſt feeling, but then, it
ſhall be ſo ſenſible and ſeeling as it ſhall accuſe and condemne it

that we will ſeeke to purpoſe and will finde if it be poſſible. But
when the Almightie ſeeketh with his Candle in his hand, how is
it poſſible but that he ſhould finde what he ſeeketh for? This is a
iudgement by it ſelf of which all ye iudgements of men are wide.
Before the Tribunals and iudgement ſeates of men the truth is
often obſcured, and the offences of men are eyther ſmothered,
diſſembled, or diminiſhed: when as eyther the Iudge is deceiued,
or the witneſſes is corrupted, or the guiltie man beguileth
both: but there is none of all theſe in this Iudgement. The
conſiſtoriall places of men, reſpect conſanguinitie, affinitye Nobilitie:
but theſe haue no priuiledge in that impartiall place:
For thus the Pſalmiſt ſaith:Pſal 49. 16. 
               Bee not thou afraide when one is
made rich, and when the glorie of his houſe is increaſed. For
he ſhall take nothing away when he dyeth, neither ſhall his

               Againſt this day of wrath and of the declaration
of the iuſt iudgement of God, he will rewarde euery
man according to his workes. So hee dooth in another place:

               We muſt all appeare before the iudgement ſeate of Chriſt,
               1. Cor. 5. 10. 
               that
euery man may receiue the things which is done in his bodie
be it good or euill.
               Mat. 16. 1
                     •
                  . So doth Chriſt in Mathew. The ſon of man
ſhall come in the glorie of his father, then ſhall he giue to euerie
man according to his deeds. The ſentence of iudgement is
formed according to our deeds.Mat 25. 41▪ 43. 46. 
               I was an hūgred &amp; ye fed me not.
for this cauſe Chriſt ſaith: And they ſhall come forth that
haue done good vnto the reſurrection of life:

               but they that
haue done euil, to the reſurrection of condemnation. It is alſo
as plaine a point, that our words ſhal be ventilated and iudged. A
blaſphemous worde belked againſt the ſpirit of God, is both accomptable
and vnpardonable▪ according to this ſaying of our Sauiour?

                  8. 29. 
               nor in the world to
come. Yea euery vaine word ſhall be ſentenced to iudgement, as
Chriſt ſaith:Matt. 12. 36. 37. 
               Of euery idle worde that men ſhall ſpeake, they
ſhall giue account thereof at the day of iudgement: For by thy
words thou ſhalt be iuſtified, and by thy wordes thou ſhalt be
condemned. If not any idle word may be borne with, how ſhall
oaths and curſed ſpeaches, which are as common as ſtones in the
ſtreet be borne with? Wo be to great dinners, whereat when we
haue béene at our full meales, we haue full mouthes, and powre
out waſtful words of wind, as luſtily as we haue powred in wine
wantonly. Iob 
               
                  •
               umpeth with the former, declaring that we ſhall
haue it fall by our words:Iob. 20. 29. 
               This is the portion of the wicked
man from God, and the heritage that he ſhall haue of God for
his words Chriſt telleth the wicked ſeruant,Matt. 12. 34 that he will conuict
and condemne him by his own mouth▪ 
               Cyprian is of that minde,
that the rich glutton was moſt tormented in his tongue,Cypr. li. 1. ep 1. becauſe
in his tongue he moſt offended Wherefore ſet we a watch before
our tongue and ward we well the doore of our lips,Luke 16. 24. that no vnbeſeeming
word may paſſe out of it here after to puniſh vs.Pſal. 34. 13. A godly
man purpoſing to commit the whole Pſalme to memorie, and to
meditate well vpon it: when he had weyed well the firſt verſe of
it in theſe words: I ſaid I will take heed to my wayes, that I offend
not in my tongue, found ſtudie enough of that to laſt him all
his life, ſo that he could go no further. I would to God we could
take out this leſſon while we liued, &amp; we ſhould he highly learned.

The calling of our brother but Foole in malice of minde,Matt. 22. 4. is culpable
of hell fire, ſo Chriſt hath concluded. Now who is not
wrapped in the iudgement by this verdit? Thus great is the
Harueſt of ſinne, what with thoughts, wordes, workes, which
by a ſickle from Heauen ſhall bee cutte downe at the generall
iudgement.
         
         
            The twelfth Chapter.
            Of the terror and horror of the iudgement day.
            
               THough alreadie (as fit aduantages haue béen offered)
we haue by diuerſe inferences in ſome ſort, illuſtrated
the terror of the iudgement: yet becauſe
it beareth matter of a tractate by it ſelfe, &amp; it miniſſtreth
much profitable vſe vnto vs, we will take it
in hand. 1 The terrible ſignes, the ſorerunners of
the iudgement, doe ſignifie ſufficiently the outrage thereof. Hereupon
Euſebius Emiſſenus maketh this deduction. Cum talis futurus
ſit terror venientis, quis poterit terrorem ſuſtinere iudicantis. If
ſuch be the terror of his comming, who ſhall abide the terror of
his iudging? Theſe ſignes haue had a roome by themſelues, and
therefore we heere leade them. 2 The matter we haue in hand
is euicted by the number without number that is to be iudged.Iſai. 45. 23. 
               I
haue ſworne by my ſelfe (ſaith God) the worde is gone out of
my mouth in righteouſneſſe,
               Matth. 7. 23. 
               and ſhall not returne,
               Luke 17. 30. &amp; 22. 69. 
               that euerie
knee ſhal bow vnto me, &amp;c. An hoaſt innumerable as the ſands
of the ſea, ſhall ſtand before him. They ſhall be called together as
ſoone as an arrow can be deliuered out of a bowe, in a moment, in
the twinckling of an eie, at the laſt trumpet. Make this ſuppoſall
(my brethren) that al the bodies of men did lye vpon one heap,
what a ruthfull ſight would it make: therefore what an obiect
and ſpectacle will that be, when ſo many Myriads of men ſhal be
muſtred together in the ayre at the iudgement day? When the
Kings writ is out for the execution of a noble man, ye ſhall haue
huge heapes of people trudging to the execution place: but in
the great day of iudgement, wherein ſo many kings ſhall ſtande
out in Chaines, and ſo manie Nobles in Linkes of Iron naked,

trembling, all their proude retinue cut from their heeles▪ to receiue
a ſentence of a neuer dying death, what beholding will
there bee of that, and how formidable will the face and faſhion
of the ſame bee? 3 The greatneſſe of Gods anger which will
bee declared at that day, ſheweth likewiſe the great horribleneſſe
of that day. The whole packe of worldly calamities, as
plagues, bloodſhed, famine, rage of waters, and ſuch like, are
but a ſparke of that fire of furie that lyeth cloſe in his breaſt, couered
(as it were) with Aſhes, which will breake out and climbe
like the Sun in the morning, and conſume ſinne and ſinners like
ſtubble at the dreadfull iudgement. The Lorde ſent this errant
vnto Pharaoh:
               Exod. 9. 14. 
               I will at this time ſend all my plagues vpon
thine heart. &amp;c. And indeede for this cauſe haue I appointed
to ſhewe my power in thee, and to declare my name throughout
all the worlde. The obſtinate ſinner in the iudgement
ſhal be the ſoule of this ſentence, vpon his vilde head ſhalbe powred
the full violl of the red mixt wine of his wrath, God will get
him a name by him, and by their puniſhment make declaration of
the greatneſſe of his righteous iudgements. The ſtroke of Gods
hand in this life, is but the ſtroke of a rod: but the puniſhment laid

            The diſcouerie that Ham made of the nakedneſſe of Noah his
Father,Gen. 9. 22. 25 his irriſion and inſultation thereupon, the ſleepe of Noah
in his tabernacle, his anſwere when he awaked, anſwereth
notably the manner of Gods iudgement, with the euent thereof.
For here Chriſt their Father is derided by his wicked Sonne
Cham, (I meane the whole progenie of all prophane people, who
make a mocke of his Croſſe, and inſult ouer his ſhame. The
afflicted eſtate of the Goſpell is traduced by them and deſpiſed.
In the meane while Chriſt who is thus contemned, ſeemeth a
ſleepe as Noah was, as though hee ſaw not, and vnderſtood not
what a ſinner doth. For how many Fornicators, Adulterers,
blaſphemers hath hee long ſuffered to eſcape vnpuniſhed. But
wil be alwaies ſleepe? no he wil awake as one out of ſleep, and
like a Giant refreſhed with wine, wil finite the enemies vpon
the hinder partes, and put them to a perpetuall ſhame. Then
as Noah when he awoke and knew what Cham had doon,
denounced his iudgement vpon Cham. Curſed ſhalt thou be.
So Chriſt when hee ariſeth and perceiueth what the wicked hath
done, he ſhall wrap them in the great curſſe, and ſay: Goe ye curſed
into hell fire prepared for the Deuill and his Angells:

As if hee ſhould haue ſaid, I call you the bleſſed of my Father,

your faith.
            The workes that are heere ſpecified, are workes of Charitie
not of vanitie, as monaſticall vowes, and ſuch as haue foundation
from humain traditions: Theſe containe all whatſoeuer elſe

But with their departure is the bleſſing departed from them

long ſhall theſe puniſhments be vpon vs? Truely this their end
ſhall bee without end, the worme dyeth not, and the fire neuer
goeth out, all the waters of the South cannot quench this fire,
therefore the nature of this fire is ſet downe in the ſoote of the
ſentence euerlaſting fire. Yet it were ſome refection (like the
droppe of water,Luk 16. 19 23 14. 25. 26. 27. 28. the Purple Glution called for to coole his flaming
tongue) that they might haue anye companion to comforte
them, but they ſhall haue no better friendes then the
Fiendes, the black Guard of Deuils, their tormentors, ſhall
aſſociate them: and this is the binding and winding vp of all
in theſe wordes prepared for the Deuill and his Angells. Yet
further to worke vppon theſe wordes, that they may better
worke in our ſoules, wee will diue more deepely into euerie circumſtance.
            But to the vnfolding of theſe miſteries to the full, we had néede
of a damned Doctor out of another world that might ſpeake with
a feeling, to giue vs more feeling, ſuch a one as the Glutton entreated
of Abraham might be ſent out of Hell to forewarne his
Bretheren. For albeit, the ſcripture is Schoolemaſter ſufficient
as Abraham tolde Diues ſaying: They haue Moſes and the
Prophets. Yet no Preacher is more pleaſing to thoſe that are
towards hell, then one that commeth from hell according to this
ſurioynder of that damned Epicure. Nay father Abraham, but
if one come vnto them from the dead, they will amend their

liues. How is it poſſible that a peece of Timber, that taketh vp
the roome of a whole houſe ſhould be drawne out of the little wicket,

offence for the offence was but momentame, and the iudgement
is eternall, which ſeemeth not to be anſwerable to Gods infinite
mercie. We anſwere extraordinarie tranſgreſſion hath no
proportion with ordinarie correction. Againe, what is the
cauſe that thy domeſticall and ordinarie fire goeth out? Is it
not becauſe thou feedeſt it not with combuſtible matter? For
let it haue alwayes ſtouer giuen to it, and it will alwayes continue.
In hell the fire is maintained by fewell fit for it. For
there is euerie mans wicked will, and endleſſe deſire of ſinning
which can neuer be done away, becauſe there is no repentance
in hell, which is the nutriment and preſeruatiue of
this fire. Therefore ſo long as the ſinne remaineth, it is but equitie
and iuſtice that the puniſhment ſhould continue. Sinners
are like Card-players, who will not giue ouer though the night
bee neuer ſo much ſpent, vnleſſe their Candle ſaile them: ſo did
not the light of life faile them, and were not their Candle
(as Iob ſaieth) put out, and ſpent to the Socket, they would not
ceaſe to ſinne. Wherfore the puniſhment is agreeable with their
ſinfull wiſhes. They wiſh to ſinne for euer: therefore they are
worthily plagued for euer.
            Therewarde of the righteous is euerlaſting: therefore the
wages of the wicked is euerlaſting. May not the ſonne is ſinne
againſt the father, and the ſubiect againſt his ſoueraigne, as in
the rule of reaſon and iuſtice the one may be diſinherited, and
the other confined and baniſhed for euer? If wee admit theſe;
it holdeth by compariſon, that our heauenly King and father
may doe ſo with his degenerate children, and rebellious people.
But yet it is verie ſtrange, that this fire ſhould burne, and not
conſume? But the anſwere hereof is, the will of the Creator,
who hath giuen this condition and qualitie vnto it. The
beaſt called the Salamander, is not burnt but nouriſhed by the
fire, and thou maiſt by anoynting thy ſelfe with the lard and fat

            Thus death ſhall be a reſtauratiue to the damned, and dying
they ſhall neuer die. Who doth not now ſhake and quake at the
remembrance of ſuch erquiſite iudgement? In reſpect of this fire,

and ſtinging creatures, that will come gnawing vpon vs
round about? There is weeping with a witneſſe, for the eies ſhall

the clattering of an army of armed men. Flaetus ex dolore, ſtridor

of ſéeth,Bernard 9. of the furor that we ſhall there be put vnto. There no part
of body or ſoule ſhall be able to ſolace or ſuccor one another, but all

            There is no order, but eternall horror. There is an ende without
ende, a death that dieth not: fire inextinguiſhable: darkneſſe

and Gall: there be thoſe malignant aſpects, peſtilence, blood, pillars
of ſmoke, huge hailſtones, ſtormes and terrible tempeſts,
wherewith he will plead his righteous cauſe againſt the damned.
That is that capable, and wide Winepreſſe of the Lords indignation,
where the ſmoke goeth vp foreuer, and there is no
reſt day nor night: there be the infinite and vnmercifull plagues
which the Angels of God powre out of their glaſſe bottels when
blood is giuen them to drinke, and they boyle ſo with heate, as
they eate their verie tongues for griefe. Who can better make

may hee drawne to theſe two heades. 1. To
thoſe that belong vnto the minde. 2. To
thoſe that appertaine vnto the bodie. The
ſtate of the bodie ſhall bee ſuch as no labours
or ſorrowes ſhall ſeaze any more vppon it,
according to that which the ſpirit in the Reuelation ſaith:
God ſhal wipe away all teares from their eyes:

neither ſhall there bee anye more paine. The heauenlye
properties of our bodies are liuelye ſhadowed and repreſented
vnto vs in the conditions of the bodie of Chriſt at his reſurrection:
there being nothing to the contrarie, but that we
ſhould hope that our bodies ſhould be conformable to his bodie,

and that we his members ſhould bee ſutable to him that
is our head. This is that the Apoſtle ſaith, Who ſhal change
our vile bodie,
               Phil. 3. 21. 
               that it may bee facioned like his glorious
bodie. 2. The mind and ſpirit ſhall then bee endowed with
this gift, that the ſlanerie of ſinne ſhall no more take holde
of it, the fleſh (the inſolent yoak-fellow thereof,) ſhal no more
ouererowe it, it being then at quietneſſe with the ſpirit.
2. Wee ſhall then loue God according to the exigence of
his royall law, his felicitie ſhall affect vs as our owne. All
motions and perturbations of the minde, as of enuie, ſelfe-loue,
and the like ſhall be voided. 3. That which is of moſte
moment, which euerie one that is godly moſte of all deſtreth,
which is the knowledge of God, ſhall then be in full and perfect
manner giuen vnto it.1. Cor. 13 12. Whecefore Paul ſaith: Now
wee ſee through a glaſſe darkelye: but then ſhall wee ſee
face to face. Now I knowe in part: but then ſhall I know
euen as I am knowne. All vales and curtaines ſhall then
be drawne aſide, and wee ſhall ſee God indeede in his perfect
beautie, which none heere poſſiblie could doe and liue, according
to that which God ſaith to Moſes:
               Exod. 33. 20.

leaue the Chriſtian Reader to his choyce. They that
pleade for paritie, and equalitie of reward, reaſon in this
for
                  •
               e:Math. 20. 13. 14. 15. 1. Thoſe that laboured in the Vine-yard, though
their worke differed; their wages was all one: the laſt
had his pennye aſwell as the firſt, and the firſt had no more,
though he murmured neuer ſo much againſt his Maiſter,
neither had hee any wrong doone him as the couenant betweene
him and his Maiſter abſolutely concludeth. 2. Their
ſecond reaſon is Chriſtes aſſeueration.Math. 13. 43. Dan. 12. 3. 
               Then ſhall the iuſt
men ſhine as the Sun in the kingdome of their Father. But
there can bee no greater light then that the Sunne giueth.
And none but the iuſt ſhall enter into this kingdome: therefore
they ſhall all haue the light of this Sunne, that is to ſay,
they ioyntlye ſhall haue the perfection of all glorie. 3. They
alſo vrge the caſe thus:Math. 22. 30 Make. 12. 25. Luk. 20. 34. 
                     〈◊〉
                  . 36 Chriſt diſputing with the Phariſees
about the reſurection: likeneth our eſtate in heauen to the
condition of the Angells, without anye mention of different
contribution. 4. Whereas in this life there are oddes
betweene vs, they giue the cauſe thereof to the fleſh, which
they carrie about them, beeing more or leſſe regenerate as
they are more or leſſe mortified in the fleſh: Of which burden
we ſhall bee eaſed in the other life, the infirmitie of the
fle
                  •
               h beeing to bee done away, and ſo there ſhall be no diſturbance
why wee ſhould not all receiue the like recompence.
5. Chriſt promiſeth to the twelue Apoſtles equall glorie in
heauen, that they ſhall ſit on twelue ſeates and Iudge the
twelue Tribes of Iſrael.
               Luke. 22. 30. Math. 19. 28. And doubtle
                  •
               ſe Paul though he bée
the thirteenth cannot but be equall with them in honour, being
vnequall, and aboue them in labour. 6. Paul ſeemeth to
ſhake handes with this ſide,1. Cor. 15. 10. making the Corinthians
and with them all the faithfull in the like eſtate of glorie,

while hee ſaith:1. Cor. 6. 2. 3. 
               Knowe you not that wee ſhall iudge the
Angel?
            
            7. Laſtly it is written that the ſufferings of theſe times
haue no proportion with our future felicitie. If God reſpecteth
not our workes in this worke: from whence ſay
they doe wee draw this difference of the recompence? This
our dignitie is meerelye Gods dignation: therefore wee
fetch the inequalitie thereof not from our merrits, but his
mercie: whereas they of the contrarie ſide ſeeme to ſtrengthen
their opinion by diſtinguiſhing of workes, as if by the
condignitie of them wee did earne and worke out this
glories.
            There bee other reaſons, but theſe are the chiefeſt that
make for this matter. The aduerſe part is aſwell prouided
to hold their aſſertion: Their arguments are many and
good, and they are theſe. 1. Firſt they ſay, God will reward
euery one according to his workes, and as his worke
is ſo ſhall his wages be.
            The Scriptures goe with this:Rom. 2. 6. it is Paules ſaying: Who
will reward euerie man according to his workes. 2. Daniel
foretelling the condition of the Saints after this life,
is flat for difference of rewardes, ſaying: They that be wiſe
ſhall ſhine as the brightneſſe of the firmament,
               Dan. 12. 3. 
               and they
that turne many to righteouſneſſe ſhall ſhine as the Stars
for euermore. But there is manifeſt difference betweene
the brightneſſe of the firmament, and the brightneſſe of the
Starres. 3. From the contraries they conclude the caſe
thus: There are diuerſities of puniſhments in Hell, therefore
the conſequence holdeth by compariſon that there is varietie
of rewardes in heauen. That the ſufferings in Hell
are ſundrie, it is apparant by Chriſtes wordes: It ſhall
bee eaſier in that day for Tyrus and Sydon,
               Math. 11. 22. Luke. 10, 13. 14. 
               then for
Corozain, and Bethzaide and for Sodome, then for Capernaum:
wherefore degrees alſo of glorie are diuided.
4. That there is not onely one reward for all the righteous,
but that there are manie of them, it is plaine by that which
Chriſt elſewhere ſaith:Iohn. 14. 1. 
               In my Fathers houſe are manye

dwelling places. 5. Further if our ſtate muſt be ſutable

other glory of the Starres: for one Starre differeth from

               e illuſtrate the differences of glory, that ſhal
bee in mens bodies after there ſurrection. Finally if we may
meaſure this matter by the line of verie probable reaſon, it
is verie likely that the degrees of glorie in the life to come,
ſhall anſwere the diuerſiue of iudgements and qualities giuen

vs in this life. The more we haue vſed our Talents
by heauenly diſpenſation committed vnto vs, to the glorie of
God, and the good of the church, the more ſhall our felicitie
bee in the day of retribution: wherefore the twelue Apoſtles
who were royallye embroatered and garniſhed with giftes,
and were Maiſter workemen in the Primitiue Church, ſhal
haue that ſtately preheminence ouer others,Math. 19. 28. Luke. 22. 30. 
                     •
                  3. as they ſhall ſit
in iudgement ouer others▪ they ſhould haue twelue ſcaffolds
and Chaires placed for them, whereupon they ſhall fitte to
iudge the twelue Tribes of Iſrael. But it may be thought
if ſome ſhal haue ſo much, there wil be nothing for otherſome:
wee anſwere that the Fountaine of that felicitie is bottomleſſe
and can neuer bee emptied.
            It is with that as it is with the great Sea,Apo
                     •
                  . 22. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. to which if you
carrie neuer ſo capable veſſels, yet there is more then enough
alwaies to fill euerie ones tanckerd come he as often as hee
will:Reuel. 21. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. ſo though wee draw neuer ſo deepelye of the waters of
life: it hath a welſpring of euer liuing water, to giue aboundantly
to all, abone all that wee are able to ſpeake or thinke.
The eye hath not ſeene, the eare hath not heard, neither
can the heart of man conceiue the things that God hath
prepared for thoſe that loue him. The latter I embrace
as the cheerefulleſt and moſte currant opinion, let others bee
as they thinke good of contrarie imagination Beeing

               ooted
in this perſwaſion, I am heartned to all zealous contrition
in Religion, that I may attaine more heauenly benediction.
            Another queſtion would be touched though wee will not
vndertake fullie to determine it: Whether wee ſhall know
one another in heauen? I am more careleſſe in this matter,
becauſe it is curious. Let our care be to knowe whether wee
ſhal come to heauen, then to know whether wee ſhall know
one another in heauen. But it is cleere wee ſhall know
one another there, though we know them not heere. For
doubtles Adams knowledge in his beſt eſtate muſt giue
place to that knowledge which we ſhall haue in our glorified
eſtate. But Adam knew Eue whome he neuer ſaw before,

and ſaide,Gen. 2. 2
                     •
                  
                
               This is bone of my bone, and fleſh of my fleſh:
Therefore what reaſon is againſt it, why wee ſhould not
knowe one another in heauen, though neuer knowne heere
to vs?Marke 9. 4.
