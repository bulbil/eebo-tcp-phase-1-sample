            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                  The German hee was dead,
                  And for this fact the Merchant man
                  was iudg'd to lose his head.
                  
                     A sweet thing is love,

                  As white as milke hee wore:
                  His Stockings were of silke,

                  All women said great pity 'twas,
                  So sweet a man should die.
                  The Merchants of the Towne,
                  From death to set him free,
                  Did proffer there two thousand pound,
                  but yet it would not be.

                  'Tis not by long acquaintance sir,
                  whereby true loue doth grow.
                  
                     A sweet thing is love, &amp;c.
                  
               
               
                  Then beg my life, quoth hee,
                  And I will be thine owne;
                  If I should seeke the world for loue,
                  More loue cannot be showne.
                  The people on that word,
                  Did giue a ioyfull cry,
                  And said, it had great pitie been,
                  so sweet a man should die
                  
                     A sweet thing is love, &amp;c.
                  
               
               
                  I goe my Loue, shee said,
                  I run, I flye for thee;
                  And gentle Headsman spare a while,
                  My Louers life for mee:
                  Unto the Duke shee went,
                  Who did her griefe remoue;
                  And with an hundred Maidens more,
                  shee went to fetch her Loue.
                  
                     A sweet thing is love, &amp;c.
                  
               
               
                  With musicke sounding sweet,
                  The 
                        •
                     ormost of the traine,
                  This gallant Maiden like a Bride,
                  Did fetch him backe againe:
                  Yea hand in hand they went
                  Unto the Church that day,
                  And they were married presently
                  in sumptuous rich array.
                  
                     A sweet thing is love, &amp;c.
                  
               
               
                  To England came hee then,
                  With this his louely Bride,
                  A fairer woman neuer lay
                  By any Merchants side:
                  Where I must leaue them now,
                  In pleasure and delight;
                  But of their name aud dwelling place,
                  I must not here recite.
                  
                     A sweet thing is love,
                     It rules both heart and mind;
                     There is no comfort in the world
                     to women that are kind.
                  
               
               FINIS.
