            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               iage, vnto the day that Noe wēt

into the Arke: and the flood came and destroyed them. Likewiſe alſo as it was in the daies of Lot: they eat, they drancke, they bought, they ſold, they planted, they builte. But in the day that Lot went out of Sodome, it rained fire and brimſtone from Heauen, and destroyed them all. This prophecie muſt needs be fulfilled, and in the one part it is already in our eies. For mens harts were neuer more generally, and of all ſortes, ſet vpon riches and pleaſures, then now towarde the comming of Christ to make the diſſolution. I holde it therefore the dutie of all Gods faithfull meſſengers, moſt inſtantly to warne their Chriſtian people, to beware, least they

alſo bee carried awaye with the ſtreame of this common infection. Hereby was I moued to make speciall choyſe of the Booke called Eccleſiaſtes, for to expound the ſame vnto that people which I teach, being wholly framed for the purpoſe, to drawe men from the vanities of this world. It was ſet forth by that noble king Solomon, who was the wiſeſt, the richest, and highest in royaltie &amp; honour vnder the Heauens. He made the greatest triall, and had the deepeſt experience in all the chiefe and moste precious things of this world. He was ledde alſo by a higher spirite then his owne, being a worthy Prophete of God.
            
               After I had finiſhed this booke, and my Sermons noted by one that did write, I was requeſted to pervſe &amp; to perfect them, in ſome better ſort for the Printe: Which as leaſure ſerued I haue performed in one part. If that weake meaſure of giftes, which the Lord hath beſtowed vpon me, bring any good by this trauaile vnto the Churche, I ſhall be glad: and ready to beſtow ſome paines, (if it pleaſe God) about the reſt.
            I am bold to offer this vnto your Ladyſhip, as a token of a dutifull and thankefull minde, for ſo honorable fauours as I haue receyued frō the right Honourable my Lord the Earle of Warwike, and from

your Honour. I am alſo encouraged herevnto, with this, that your Ladyſhip hath long time continued an earnest louer, and zealous profeſſor of the glorious Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt. My earnest prayer is, that God will continue and increaſe the ſame, with all heauenly giftes, and vertues of his holy ſpirite, to the glory of his moſt holy name, the good of his Church, and your owne eternall ioye. Amen.

Eccleſiaſtes. Chap. 1.
               
                  
                     THe wordes of Eccleſiaſtes, &amp;c.
               
               This Inſcription of the booke ſheweth whoſe doing it was, when it is ſaid, they be the words of Eccleſiaſtes, the ſonne of Dauid, king in Ieruſalem, this was king Solomon. They be his wordes, and his writing. Hée ſet it foorth for an inſtruction of Gods people in all ages.
               If any will obiect, that here is no proper name mentioned, and all the kinges of Iuda were the ſons of Dauid: why might not this Eccleſiaſtes bée Ezechia, Iehoſaphat, or ſome other of the godly kinges, before, or after them. I anſwere, that the ſonne of Dauid, which wrote this booke, was he that did excell in wiſedome

all that were before him in Ieruſalem, (as it is expreſſed in the 16. verſ
                     •
                   of this Chapter,) and therefore could b
                     •
                   no other but Solomon. For of him God ſaith, 2. Chro. 1. Becauſe thou haſt aſked2. Chro. 1. wiſdome, wiſdome is granted vnto thée▪ and riches, and honour, ſo that there hath not béene the like among the kinges tha

                   haue béene before thée, neither after thée ſhall there be the like.
               It may be demaunded, why he doeth not, (as in the Prouerbes, &amp; in the Song of Songes, which hée made of Chriſt and his Church,) call himſelfe by his vſual
                     •
                   name, Solomon, by which hee was be
                     •
                   knowen: but doeth take a ſtrange name▪ not vſed elſwhere in all the Scriptures▪ For through this booke hée calleth himſelfe in Hebrewe, Koheleth. In déed, this is ſomewhat to be ſtood vpon: and I will briefly ſhewe you the reaſon of it, which is to be gathered from the ſignification o
                     •
                   the word.
               The Gréekes did tranſlate this word Koheleth, Eccleſiaſtes, and that is in ou
                     •
                   Engliſh tongue, a Preacher: and therefore

we ſay in our tranſlation, the words 
                     •
                  f the Preacher, and ſo it ſhould be the 
                     •
                  ame of an office, or function, if we take 
                     •
                  t in that ſence. But we neuer finde any Prophet, Prieſt, or Teacher, in all the whole Bible, called Koheleth: &amp; doubt
                  
                     •
                  eſſe, if he had meant to call himſelfe a 
                     •
                  reacher, he would haue ſaid, The words 
                     •
                  f Kohel, rather than Koheleth, which is 
                     •
                  n the Feminine gender.
               
                  Kahal is an aſſemblie, &amp; congregation of people, or the Church. Koheleth might 
                     •
                  ery well carie this ſignification, to be one that doeth gather the ſame together, or that doeth ſpeake in the aſſemblie: but that he vſeth (as I ſaid) the Feminine gender, and therefore it carieth the moſt 
                     •
                  itte ſence, that he calleth himſelfe an Eccleſiaſticall perſon, (not as we call them Eccleſiaſticall which beare office in the Church-matters) but a perſon that is of the Church, or a ſoule vnited to ye church, or ſpeaking in the church. Whereby we may perceiue, that this name is a nots for euer of his repentance, how that hée forſooke the euil into which he had fallen,

and turned againe to the Lord his God. For the holie Scripture doth teſtifie, that Solomon did marrie outlandiſh women, which were Idolaters, they drew away his heart, ſo that he ſinned, and fell grieuouſly. He was reproued of God for it,1. Kings. 11. as we read, 1. Kings 11. He made this booke, to remayne as a publike record of his returne, and therfore he is Koheleth, a perſon, or a ſoule reconciled to God, and to his Church. In this ſence we may call him Eccleſiaſtes.
               
               I know it will be replied by ſome, that the word of God doth not any where teſtifie, that Solomon euer repented, after his great fall, but leaueth it in doubt: and to proue his repentance by this one title, by which hee doeth name himſelfe, is but a weake reaſon. For, let the ſignification of the name be certaine, yet is it vncertaine, whether he wrote this booke after his fall. To this I anſwere, that he did write it after the long triall and experience which he had made in all things vnder the ſunne, and no doubt, after his fall. For, touching his repentance, although

it be not ſaid any where, in theſe expreſſe words, Solomon repented: yet may it bée proued by neceſſarie conſequence out of the ſcriptures, that he did vnfaynedly repent.
               I reaſon thus. He was one of Gods elect, therefore he returned to his God by true repentance, ſéeing it is vnpoſſible, that the elect ſhould periſh, Math. 24. ToMath. 24. proue that he was Gods elect, I firſt alledge that which was ſaid to Dauid at his birth, 2. Sam. 12. &amp; which Nehemiah
                  2. Sam. 12. Nehe. 13. doeth ſpeake of him, Chap. 13. Nathan the Prophet was ſent to Dauid from the Lord, willing him to call his name Iedediah, tendring this cauſe, that God loued him.
               
                  Nehemiah ſpeaking of the fall of Solomon, ſaith, yet he was beloued of his God, grounding vpon thoſe wordes of Nathan. What a ſpéech were this, to ſay, hée was beloued of his God, if he were not gods elect? Doeth the Scripture euer ſpeake ſo of any reprobate? God ſaith by the prophet Malachie, Chap. 1. Iacob haue I loued, and Eſau haue I hated.
                  Mal. 1.
                  
Saint Paul hereupon doeth argue, Rom. 9. and proue that God hath choſen Iacob.
                  Rom. 9. And why may we not reaſon thus vpon theſe words, the Lorde loueth him, hée was beloued of his God: therfore he was Gods elect. Then the Scripture leaueth not his repentance in doubt. I will not ſtand vpon this, that hée was a figure of Chriſt, Pſal. 45. That hee was an excellentPſalm. 45. Prophet, opening high miſteries of Chriſt and his Church: but I will come to that which is written of him, 1. Chro. 17.
                  1. Chr. 17. where God ſaith to Dauid, I will be his father, and he ſhall be my ſonne, and I will not take away my mercie from him, as I did from him that was before thée.
               Some wil ſay this is ſpokē of Chriſt, for the title is too high for any Angell, Heb. 1. I anſwere, that God ſaid of Dauid,
                  Hebr 1. thou art my ſonne: but yet, as he was the Figure of Chriſt, Pſal. 2. and ſo her
                     •
                  
                  Pſalm. 2. of Solomon, For this cānot be denied, that the Lord ſpeaketh it of that ſonne of Dauid, which ſhould build the materiall Temple, which Dauid had in purpoſe

for to build: and God ſaid of this man, I will be his father, and he ſhall be my ſonne, and I will not take my mercie from him. If God did not take his mercie from him, then he repented. When heir Solomon was dead, his way is ioyned with the way of Dauid his father. For Rehoboā
                   his ſonne did wel thrée yeres, and thoſe thrée yeres he is ſaide to haue walked in the way of Dauid and Solomon, 2. Chron. 11. Solomons beginning2. Chr. 11. was good, and ſo was his ende, or els hee ſhoulde not be coupled with Dauid. And thus we ſée he was Gods elect, and therefore repented, and became Koheleth. So that we hold for certaintie, that this name which he geueth himſelf, and this booke, are for publike note, and record of his repentance, and reconciliation to God, and his Church.
               Thus much of the Anthor of this booke, and for what cauſe he calleth himſelfe by this vnuſuall name. Now we muſt obſerue to what end he made it, or what was his chiefe purpoſe and intent in writing: which in few wordes I may

ſay was this, euen to inſtruct men how to come vnto the true bleſſedneſſe. A worthy worke, and moſt profitable vnto al that thirſt and long for ſaluation. The whole worke conſiſteth of two partes. For he draweth men firſt frō the wrong way. Thoſe that ſet their hearts vpon the riches, the honors, the pleaſures, and the wiſdome vnder the ſunne, to ſéeke any felicitie or good in them, are in a wrong way. From this he perſuadeth: then he ſetteth forth the right way vnto bleſſedneſſe, which is in the true worſhip and feare of God. Hereunto he mooueth very carefully. We muſt note, that he beginneth with the vanitie and miſerie of all thinges vnder the Sunne, becauſe no man can worſhip God a right, or feare him in truth, vntil he haue learned to renounce the world. Marke well what our Lord ſaith, No man can ſerue two Maſters, ye can not ſerue God and
                  Math. 6. 
                  Mammon, Math. 6. No man can loue God, which loueth the world. For thus it is plainely ſaid: Loue not the world
                     •
                  , neither the things of the worlde, if any

man loue the world, the loue of the Father is not in him. For whatſoeuer is in the world, as the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eies, and the pride of life, is not of the father, but is of the world. 1. Ioh. 2.
                  1. Ioh. 2. The loue of the world is enmitie againſt God, ſo that he which will be a fréend of the world, maketh himſelfe the enemie of God. Iam. 4.
                  Iam. 4.
               
               In the ſame place alſo wee learne, that ſuch as loue the worlde, committe who redome againſt God: for he calleth them adulterers, and adultereſſes. It is becauſe mans heart and ſoule ought to be maried to God, and to be kept chaſt and pure vnto him for the lone: now when it doth giue away ye loue vnto the world, and doth imbrace it as a ſweete Ladie in which it doth delight, it committeth ſpirituall whoredome. For the ſame cauſe the holy Ghoſt calleth the couetous man an Idolater. Epheſ. 5. His harte ſhouldEpheſ. 5. be ſet vpon God, and it is ſet vpon the world, he ſhould truſt in the liuing God, and he doth truſt in riches. What is this but to ſet vp an Idoll? The cares alſo of

this world, and the deceitfulneſſe of riches, are thornes which choake the good ſéede of life. Math. 13. Plow vp your fallowMath. 13. and ſo we not among the thornes, ſaith God vnto his people, Ierem. 4. ByIerem. 4. all theſe places we may ſée how neceſſarie it is, that before Solomon do come to teach men where they ſhall ſéeke true bleſſednes, he emptieth their harts of the loue and care of earthly things: and this is that I ſaid 
                     •
                  he draweth men firſt from the wrong way. How well he doth performe this, we ſhall vnderſtande, if the Lord do giue vs eares to heare.
               
                  Vanitie of vanities, ſaith Eccleſiaſtes:
                  Verſe. 2. 
                  vanitie of vanities, all is vanitie. Now wée come to the matter. For this is his propoſition, in which he propoundeth and affirmeth that, which after ward he manifeſteth &amp; proueth by arguments. It conteineth in it the firſt of thoſe two heads or points of doctrine: namely that in all things vnder heauen, there is nothing to be found but extréeme vanitie, and miſerie, and therefore ſuch as ſéek
                     •
                   the world are in a wrong way. He pronounceth

this (as we all may ſée) with a moſt vehement outcrie, and as it were with the ſhril ſound of a Trumpet. The dul harte of man doth force him thereunto. For we are all by nature ſo earthly minded, ſo drowned and ouer whelmed in the luſts and pleaſures of this world, and our eares ſo ſtopped with earth, that we can hardly be made to heare. Nay to ſay the truth, let him ſpeak neuer ſo lowd and ſhrill, to draw mens heartes from this world, except God worke by his ſpirite, and giue eares, hee ſpeaketh vnto ſtones. Ponder wel in your minds with earneſt meditation, the waight of this phraſe, Vanitie of vanities, and the ſame doubled with this addition, all is vanitie, and ſée if yee can comprehende what the ſpirit of God doth here vtter, concerning the extréeme vanitie of all things in this worlde, for to quench the flames of our mad loue towardes the ſame. For I had rather thus exhort men vnto ſuch meditation of his words, then to ſtand in opening his pharſe and manner of ſpeach. Conſider therfore that he contenteth not

himſelfe, to ſay all is vaine, but vanitie it ſelfe, yea the vanitie of vanities.
               And ſeing our vnbeléefe is ſuch, that we can not giue credite vnto the worde of God, where it doth but affirme, and the ſpirite of truth doth thus farre yéeld vnto vs, as to make proofe by reaſons and argumentes of that which hee here vttereth, let not vs be wanting on our parts through careleſſe negligence, and ſo heape ſinne vpon ſinne, vnto our greater condemnation. For the more graciouſly hee applieth himſelfe for to heale our ſoules, we (refuſing or neglecting this bountifulnes) the more we heape vp ingratitude, yea the more iuſt and heauie is our damnation.
               
                  What profit is there vnto a man of
                  Verſe. 3. 
                  all his trauell, in which he traueleth vnder the Sunne? Here we haue the firſt reaſon, which he vſeth to proue his propoſition. He doeth not expreſſe euerie part of the argument, but the aſſumption onely. For the principle vpon which hée groundeth, is ſo cléere, that there is no head ſo dull, but doeth acknowledge it:

and therefore is omitted. Neuertheleſſ
                     •
                   for your helpe I will note it. This it is, about whatſoeuer there is labour ſpent, yea ſuch labour as carieth with it griefe, (for he vſeth a word that ſignifieth labor with moleſtation) and no profite ariſeth thereof, there all is extreme vanitie and miſery. Who is (I ſay) ſuch a dullard, yea ſuch a blocke, that he will denie this, or call it into queſtion? aſke a foole, and he can ſay, it is vanitie to labour ſore and receiue no profite thereby: then if it be prooued, that man of all his ſore labour wherein he laboureth &amp; vexeth himſelfe vnder the Sunne, (that is in worldly affaires) receiueth no profite: ſhall it not follow that all theſe things are vanitie, yea euen vanitie of vanities?
               Thus wée are to conſider of the whole reaſon: the firſt part, which is the groūd of this argument, ſore toile with vexation and no profite, is vanitie. as I ſaid, is ſo cléere that the blind doo ſée it, none denie it: men doo alſo féele and find by experience, that worldly things are gotten and kept with great labour, trouble and

moleſtation. What néede he then ſtay to make any declaration of that, vnleſſe he would light a candle at none? But the other point, namely that man hath no profite of all his labours &amp; vexations, is not beléeued, For would the whole world be ſo mad as to ſtand to fill a bottomleſſe tub? We ſée all the world is buſied to get earthly things, if there be no profit enſuing, it is no better then to fill a bottomleſſe tub. Would men take ſuch paines to heape vp riches, to clime to honours, to fill and ſtuffe themſelues with delights &amp; pleaſures, yea euen to ſell their ſoules and bodies to the Diuell to come by the ſame, if they thought there were no profite remaining vnto them? It is therefore out of all doubt, that men doo make their reckoning and caſt their account, to receiue great commodities and fruite by their laboures: this then being not beléeued, but called in queſtion, he doth ſtande to proue it, and this one point being proued, all the argument ſtandeth firme and manifeſt. And howſoeuer it ſéemeth vnto mans blind nature, that there is profite

and commoditie to be looked for in the trauaile for earthly things: yet becauſe he proueth and manifeſteth by two notable reaſons that there is none, hée doeth ſhake it of as it were in ſcorne, and ſaith not, there is no profite, but what profite is there vnto man of all his ſore trauaile, wher in he trauaileth vnder the ſunne?
               He vſeth in déed diuers reaſons afterward, for to perſwade men in this point wherein they are ſo madly blinded, but I ſay two, becauſe in the words next following hée vſeth two generall arguments, the one taken from the eſtate and condition that man is in which trauaileth: the other frō the eſtate of the things in which, and for which he doth trauaile. O that men could be brought to vnderſtand thē aright, that they might ſée how they labor without all profit for this preſent world, they would not vex thēſelues &amp; deſtroy their ſoules for to get nothing. They would not be ſo grieuouſly tormē
                  ted with ſorow &amp; care, for the loſſe of the world, forgoyng that which is nothing. But alas how ſhall we be brought to beléeue

this? we make account of no gaine, but when wés finde the treaſures of the earth. We féele no loſſe, but whē we forgoe them, this is our madneſſe, vntill it pleaſe God to giue vs better wiſedome, and to open the eies of our mind, that we may acknowledge, that the things which are ſéene be temporall, and the thinges which are not ſeene, eternall. That wée may labour for the true treaſure: not for the meate which periſheth, but for that which indureth vnto eternall life. Ioh. 6.
                  Iohn. 6. Beloued, lay vp this in your hart, that Gods ſpirit here affirmeth: namely, that a man hath no profite of all his ſore trauaile, wherein he trauaileth vnder the Sunne.
               Conſider the reaſon by which he proueth it, if yée can come to be perſwaded to beléeue it, to féele it to be ſo, ye haue attained to a great matter, yée haue greatly profited, your hart is rid and cured of a ſore diſeaſe, yée haue made a great ſteppe toward the kingdome of heauen. For yée ſhal be deliuered from that which S. Paul ſpeaketh, 1. Tim. 6. They that would be1. Tim. 6.

                  nd into many fooliſh and noyſome luſts, which drowne men in deſtruction &amp; perdition: for the loue of monie is the roote of all euill, which while ſome haue luſted after, they haue erred from the faith, and haue pearced themſelues through with many ſorrowes. I ſay, if a man be thoroughly perſuaded in his hart, that there is no profite of the trauaile vnder the Sunne, he ſhal be frée from this daunger that all worldlings be in. Let vs ſée the proufes.
               
                  One generation paſſeth away, and
                  Verſe. 4. 
                  another generation commeth, &amp;c. Here wee haue the firſt reaſon, by which hee proueth, that a man hath no profite of all his trauaile, wherin he trauaileth vnder the ſunne: and ye ſée it is drawen from the eſtate which man is in. He is mortal, his dayes are fewe, his continuance is ſhort vpon the earth: for he hath but the time of his generation, he geueth place, and neuer returneth againe, but another generation ſuccéedeth. Finally, his eſtate is more vaine then the eſtate of

other creatures, as it is ſet forth by compariſon in the verſes following. Therefore there remayneth to him no profite of al his ſore trauaile, wherin he trauaileth vnder the ſunne.
               Brethren, we know it is in all mens mouthes, we are mortall, we muſt die, there is no remedie, we muſt make our bed, and lie downe in the darke: we haue but our time here. Againe, where ſhall we finde that foole, which looketh to haue any portion after he is dead, of all the thinges which are wrought vnder the Sunne? Is there any which is perſwaded he ſhall come againe to looke vppon his workes, to take pleaſure in them? Doeth he thinke that his riches ſhal féed him, or cloath him any more? Doubtles we all know, we muſt tarie here but a time, and then death will cut vs off. We are fully perſwaded, that we ſhall neuer haue vſe of any thing which we poſſeſſe here.
               How doeth it then come to paſſe, that (cleane contrarie vnto this their knowledge,) men ſet their heartes vppon this

world, and looke for profite by their labours? There is ſomewhat that doeth ſeduce men, and quench the light of this knowledge, or els how could it be thus? In déede, there be diuers thinges which doe ſeduce men, and quench the light of this knowledge: ſo that although they know they be mortal, yet can they not ſée that this is a ſufficient argument, to proue that all their trauaile for earthlie things, is to no profite: but they ſet their heart vpon them, and couet them as gréedelie, as if they ſhould liue vpon ye earth foreuer.
               I will note vnto you ſomewhat which doeth make men 
                     ••
                  d euen againſt their knowledge. Here is one great cauſe, that ſuch a thicke darke miſte doeth compaſſe men round about, that they cannot ſée a farre of, but euen at

                  and. They be not able

                     ••
                  d that doeth make them eſtéeme this world, as if it were all in all. Ten thouſand yeres (in reſpect of eternitie) are but a momēt, and as nothing, if we could wel diſcerne,

and iudge aright.
               And behold what account man maketh of thréeſcore and ten, they be euen as a worlde vnto him. For theſe, and about theſe, for to maintain his eſtate in them, he bendeth all the powers of his minde, applyeth all his ſtudies and indeuoures, laboureth, toyleth, and vexeth him ſelfe marueylouſly like a foole. Then we ſée, that this naturall ſparke of light, wherby men doe perceiue they muſt after certain yeres die, and depart from all their labours, is not ſufficient to make thē wiſe, nor deliuer them, becauſe they are compaſſed about with darkenes moſt miſerable, which cauſeth them to erre, and goe out of the way, as much, as if there were no ſparke of knowledge at all in ye mind.
               It is farre more eaſie, and poſſible, for a man to ſée cléerly twenty mile with his bodily eyes, through the thickeſt miſt, then with all the light of nature, to looke beyond this world.
               Here come the great wiſe men of the world to be fooles: for, with all the light of underſtanding which they haue, they

I ſay they be not able to doo this without ſpeciall grace, to méete with this, and to recouer men from ſuch folly, Solomon vſeth a compariſon betwéene man and other creatures, by which it appeareth, that beſides this that he is mortall, his eſtate is the moſt vaine and tranſitorie of many other.

creation of the world, God ſet the waters in two places, Gen. 1. The waters vnderGen. 1. the firmament he layd vpon heapes, and called them Seas. The waters aboue the firmament he hath hanged aloſt in the clowdes: theſe he carieth all ouer the worlde, cauſeth them to drop downe and to water the earth. They drop down in great plentie: part of them fléete into vallies, make a floud, and with all ſpéede runne into the ſea. Another part ſinke into the ground, where they, by little and little, by drayning, méete together, and by hollow vaines of the earth, from hill

This is his reaſon, by which he proueth, that they do returne againe into their owne place, and do not abide in the ſea: for if they did abide there the ſea would be filled.

life is a vapor, that appeareth for a little time, and then vaniſheth. The Prophet Dauid vſeth a compariſon beyonde all theſe, Pſal. 62

                   For he compareth the ſtatePſalm. 62. of man, yea euen of princes, with vanitie it ſelfe, and maketh it the lighter. Theſe be his words. The ſonnes of baſe perſons are vanitie, the ſonnes of nobles are deceite. If they be put together in the ballance, they will aſcende aboue vanitie. Put all men in one ballance, and vanitie in the other, and they will goe vpwarde, and be found the lighter. For, the heauier end of the ballance goeth down ward, and the lighter aſcendeth.
               How commeth it to paſſe then, that men, yea, ſuch as ſhould be wiſe, and in déede doe take themſelues of all other to be the wiſeſt, are ſo be witched, and blinded, that they make ſo great account of their eſtate in this preſent life, as if it were all in al? They thinke there is profite and commoditie of their labours, and that great, no man can perſwade them to the contrarie.
               Alas, what ſhould I ſay here? I may

well lament and bewayle our miſerable blindnes, I knowe not how to cure it. There be ſo many thinges that doe deceiue, it is almoſt without end.
               Let it be that this worde of the Lord be receiued, man is mortall, he hath but his generation, he paſſeth away as a ſhadow and neuer returneth againe, his eſtate and condition is ſo vaine and tranſitorie, that compared with other creatures, he is farre inferior: Yet this concluſion will not be receiued, therefore their remaineth no profite vnto man of all his trauaile, wherin he trauaileth vnder the ſunne, for this ſticketh faſt in the hart Although the daies of man vpon the earth be but as a vapor, that appeareth for a ſhort time and then vaniſheth, yea howſoeuer he paſſe away and returne no more, and is inferiour to other creatures, yet he receiueth very great profite by his laboures, and that many waies. He hath to féed and clothe himſelfe withall, and to ſerue other neceſſarie vſes.
               He commeth to haue countenance in the world, of worſhip and honour: his valiant

acts and wiſdome, ſhall be renowmed vnto all poſteritie. He doth conuey ouer his honour and poſſeſſions vnto his ſonne, who is as déere vnto him as his owne ſoule. He ſhall floriſh and proſper in the world. He ſhall continue the name &amp; countenance of his father, are not theſe great commodities, and worth the trauailing for: I anſwer, that theſe had néed be worth ſomewhat, for in déede they be the things for which many thouſands doo ſell there ſoules and bodies to the Deuil. They be thoſe rocks againſt which men1. Tim. 6. doo runne and make ſhipwracke of faith and a good conſcience, &amp; ſo drowne themſelues in perdition and deſtruction. The wiſe men of the worlde are poiſoned and killed with theſe baites. The Deuil deth ſuggeſt them, and mans blind hart receiueth them euen againſt the truth.
               For let vs looke well into the matter, and we ſhall find, that there is nothing in all theſe but méere deceit: the truth of this ſentence ſhall continue firme, that there is no profite vnto a man of all his labours, wherein he laboureth vnder the

Sunne. Touching the firſt, there is ſome preſent commoditie in déede obteined by mans labour, for he eateth of the labour of his handes: he hath to clothe himſelfe withall. Men are commanded to labour for that purpoſe, this beyng Gods ordinance, In the ſweat of thy browes thou

Neuertheleſſe here is nothing to contrary that which Solomon teacheth, that there is no profite to a man of all his ſore trauaile. For he vſeth a worde whichIithron. a profit that remaineth. ſignifieth a profite that doth remaine, and continue or ſticke by a man. All preſent commodities are vaine, yea moſt vaine, becauſe they continue not with menne. Againe here is nothing to driue men frō labour &amp; diligence about earthly things: but to moderate mens laboures, and to correct immoderate &amp; vaine care, which draweth men from the ſtudie of better

things. It is the ſame doctrine which Chriſt teacheth, Iohn. 6. Labour not forIohn. 6. the meat that periſheth, but for the meat that indureth vnto eternall life. And which S. Paule exhorteth vnto. 1. Cor. 7. Let him that bieth be as though he poſſeſſed1. Cor. 7. not, for ye faſhion of this world paſſeth away. I may ſay further, that to haue riches, &amp; honors be good benefites, in this reſpect alſo that by thē men are the more inabled to doo good, and ſo to be rich in good workes. But as worldly men doo account, and as they doo couet them, there is no good in them at all: for if a mans ſubſtance be increaſed neuer ſo much, hée ſhall carie none of it away with him, his pompe, ſaith the Prophet, ſhall not deſcendPſal. 49. with him into the graue, Pſalm. 49. Shée doth often and vſually follow and accompany vnto the graues mouth, but then returneth, &amp; taketh her leaue. Well his ſonne he is now aloft, this is as good to the father as if he had it himſelfe. Yea we ſée many a miſer labour like an horſe and almoſt ſterue himſelfe to make his ſonne rich: hée continueth the name, the

lands, and the houſes haue the name ſet

                     •
                  aid) many a ſoule. The worldlings

                  oneſtie.
               This is the vaine glorie which thePſal. 49. Prophet derideth, Pſal. 49. Their minde 
                     •
                  s (ſaith he) that their houſes may be for

                     •
                  heir landes. But man is in honour and ſhall not continue, he is like the beaſtes that periſh. This their way is their hope and their children approue their wordes. They ſhall lie as beaſtes in the graue, death ſhall be their ſhéepeheard. This, I ſay, is it which God ſpeaketh touching the vayne glory of blinde worldlings, which doo more earneſtly bende their minde to haue an houſe and glory in the earth to all poſteritie, then to ſéeke to

know god aright, to glory in him, to magnifie &amp; ſet vp his honor, and ſo to be glorified in the heauens for euer, to haue their houſe or name cōtinued, is but an earthly commodity, &amp; ſhould not be ſo highly preferred. But let vs yet deal more particularly in this: yt if it be poſſible, ſome of our harts may be fréed from this peſtilēt infection. Of all his ſtately palaces &amp; pleaſant orchyards, he is not alowed ſo much as one corner of an alley, or a gallery to walke in, after death hath arreſted him. The body lieth in ſome vaut where it doth rotte: beyng in the life time a companion of Princes, now peraduenture a toade or ſnake or ſome baſe vermin, ſitteth by as the onely companion. The fame and glorie is great, the name is vpon the houſes and the lands. What dooth this helpe his baſe diſhonorable bodie? theſe ſéeme ſwéete things, but that dooth ſtinke. His ſoule becauſe it did imbrace this preſent world, and ſo committed filthie whoredome and forſoke God, is in a worſe place, whether the bodie ſhall alſo come. It lieth couered in ſhame before

God and his Angels: is it any whit the

                     •
                  nd to make his Sonne happie.
               But how far wide is he alſo in that? what ſhall his ſonne or his ſonnes ſonne find more then he himſelfe did finde in theſe things? let men ſay or thinke what they can, for any good that they ſhall be able to find, either to themſelues or their children and poſteritie in wordly things, &amp; ſo applie their whole ſtudie that way, as to increaſe riches, to riſe vp to honors, and to inioy pleaſant delights: let them glory in their wiſdome by which they be aduanced, yet ſhall they be found ſtarke fooles, and this doctrine, vanitie of vanities,

all is vanitie, ſhalbe found true. Becauſe there is no profit that doth remain vnto a man of all his ſore trauaile, wherin he trauaileth vnder the ſunne, ſeing death curreth him of after a few dayes, h
                     •
                   can neuer returne againe, his place ſhall know him no more.
               Then let this firſt argument of the wiſe King Solomon ſincke into your mindes, to deſtroy the loue and care of earthly and tranſitorie things: that your harts may be frée to ſéeke God, and to be ſet vpon heauenly things, in which there is true bleſſednes. Lay not vp treaſure in earth, where ruſt and moth doo corrupt, and where théeues breake through and ſteale. But lay vp for your ſelues treaſure in Heauen, where neither ruſt nor moth corrupt, and where théeues doo notMath. 7. breake through and ſteale. Math. 7. Beready1. Tim. 6. to diſtribute and to doo good, that yée may be rich in good workes.
               Remember what is ſaid by the bleſſed2. Cor. 9. Apoſtle, He that ſoweth ſparinglie, ſhal reape ſparingly: and he that ſoweth plentifullie, ſhal reape plentifullie. The

time that ye liue here is compared vnto 
                     •
                  he ſeede time: your liberalitie, and diſtributing your goods to the poore, is the ſowing, and ſcattering abroad: becauſe, as 
                     •
                   man ſéemeth to loſe his ſéede, when hée ſcattereth it, and burieth it in ye ground: and yet it ſpringeth vp, and the harueſt commeth with great increaſe. Euen ſo, 
                     •
                  o mans thinking, he doeth depriue himſelfe of all that he geueth away, and yet 
                     •
                  s it farre otherwiſe, for it bringeth the greateſt increaſe of all other, by a plentifull harueſt, when God ſhall geue the reward.
               He is a foole that hath ſéede, and good ground, and will let the ſeaſon paſſe, and not caſt any of it into the ground. The rich man is more foole to hoarde vp golde and ſiluer, ſo that the ruſt, of them ſhal he a witnes againſt him, and ſhall denoureIam. 5. his fleſhe as fire: when he might ſcatter, and ſowe, and reape life eternall.
               Remember alſo what S. Paul ſaith, Galath. 6. He that ſoweth to the fleſh,Galat. 6. ſhall of the ſleth reap corruption: he that ſoweth to ſpirite, ſhall of the ſpirite

reape life euerlaſting. The men that trauaile for this world, and prouide for the fleſh, to ſatiſfie the luſtes thereof, heaping vp riches, &amp; beſtrowing them to that ende which they doe, when they labour ſo earneſtly for the worldly wealth, for themſelues, and their childrē, doe ſo we to the fleſh. Al their trauaile is for the fleſh, and for the maintenance of this vaine life. The harueſt that theſe ſhall haue is corruption. For, both they, &amp; al theſe things corrupt, periſh, and come to nought.
               Such as lay out, and diſtribute to the poore, ſuch as imploy their riches to aduance the goſpel, to ſet foorth Gods glory, and to be meanes to further their owne ſaluation, and the ſaluation of others: theſe ſowe to the▪ ſpirite, there ſhall an harneſt follow: they ſhall reape, and gather ſheaues of eternall life and glory.
               Behold (beloued) what differēce there is of riches laide vp in ſtore for the fleſh, and ſpent thereon: and the riches laid out to ſéeke the ſpirituall life, and heauenlie treaſure. Wiſe are they which ſowe to the ſpirite, reſpecting this harue

                   they be ſo wearie, man cannot vtter it
               
                  Now we ſée ſomewhat the ſence of the words, let vs conſider the force of the reaſon. He that will finde any good that ſhal continue, or any thing that may better his eſtate, he muſt ſéeke it, and finde it in things whoſe eſtate is good and permanent, hee muſt not looke for it in thinges whoſe eſtate and condition is miſerable, and ſubiect vnto vanitie.
               For wil any ſéeke for light in darknes? As any man ſo ſimple, as to look for bleſſednes from that which is vnder 
                     •
                  urſe? Who looketh for fréedome to be geuē him of thoſe that are in bondage? Then conſider what he ſaith, all theſe thinges are wearie, man cannot vtter it. All creatures vnder the ſunne, both thoſe yt haue life and ſence, and thoſe which are without ſence, and euery one of them, are ſub
                  
                     •
                  ect to vanitie, and long to be deliuered from the bondage of corruption. They be ſo excéeding wearie, that they groane and trauaile in paine. Therefore, man féeling his owne miſerie, and beggerlines, coue
                  
                     •
                  ing to finde good, to be made happie, or 
                     •
                  t the leaſt to haue his wretchednes mitigated,

he muſt not ſéeke it in things vnder the ſunne, for they are not able to reléeue themſelues, nor to rid themſelues out of the bondage of corruption, which lieth ſore and heauie vpon them, making them grone.
               What is the cauſe then that men ſéek for good in riches, in honors, and in pleaſures? Why doe they make account that their miſerie is aſſwaged, and mitigated by theſe? Doubtles there is no cauſe but blindnes, yea intollerable and lamentable blindnes: as they know not themſelues, ſo haue they no eyes to ſée in what caſe all creatures vnder heauen be. For if men could be brought to ſée in déede, but what this is, all theſe things are weary, man cannot vtter it, they would ſtay, and turne back their eyes, and not ſo gréedely and egarly purſue, and lay holde of thoſe poore creatures, to ſeeke ſuccour at their handes. They would ſay, we are wrong, theſe are wearie themſelues, they cannot refreſh vs: theſe are féeble, weake, and tranſitorie, how ſhal they ſupport &amp; comfort vs? They be in bondage and miſerie,

ſhall they reléeue vs? Shall wee lay holde vpon them, for to ſtay vpon them, they wil fayle vs. We follow but a blaſt of wind, and gape to fill our bellies with the Eaſt winde. We goe about to ioyne vanitie vnto vanitie: for we ſéeke help of thoſe which are in miſerie as déep as our ſelues. I ſay it is an extreme blindnes, which cauſeth men not to perceiue this.
               What then beloued? there is a naturall inclination in vs to ſéeke reléefe and helpe. Yea, but let vs ſeeke it where it is to be found, euen in our Lorde God himſelfe. Séeke as faſt to lay hold on him, as the worldlings doe to lay hold on riches, ye ſhal finde more than they. Many ſay, who wil ſhew vs any good, ſaith Dauid,

               In the wordes which follow vnto the 12. verſe, he doth ſet forth the ſame reaſon with an amplification: The eye is not ſatisfied with ſeing, neither is the eare filled with hearing. The minde of man can not ſatiſfie it ſelfe nor reſt contented when it hath laid hold of all things vnder heauen. For the eye it ſelfe is a little thing &amp; would ſoone be ſatiſfied. The eare is ſhallow and were quickly filled, but ye mind which ſetteth theſe a worke, is inſatiable. If men were not ſtarke blind, might they not reaſon thus, when a man hath heaped vp all the treaſures of the earth, when his wiſdome is increaſed, and he hath attained vnto the top of all the honour vnder heauen, yet is not his mind ſatiſfied, he coueteth ſtill to ſée,

he coueteth to heare, he coueteth to haue.
               Is it not a manifeſt proofe that all things vnder the Sunne, beyng in that vaine and tranſitorie eſtate which they be, are not able to eaſe the miſerie of mans mind? the fulneſſe of ioyes is inPſal. 16. Gods preſence alone, &amp; at his right hand there is comely pleaſure for euer more. What is then the reaſon that men do neuer ceaſe when they haue attained great things, &amp; yet féele no eaſe? Here is their fooliſh blindneſſe, they ſtill ſéeks for new things, they imagine that by a further and déeper reach, they ſhall finde ſome good.
               Here come in new deuiſes, new honours, new pleaſures, new workes, all new. He meeteth with this and ſheweth that there is nothing new vnder the heauens. When they haue gone as farre as they can, yet ſhall not their eye come to ſée, nor their eare to heare any new thing. That (ſaith he) that hath béen, is the ſame that ſhal be, and that which is done, is the ſame that ſhal be doone, neither is there any thing new vnder the ſunne. Is there

any thing whereof it may be ſaid, behold this, this is new? It hath béene in the ages that were before vs. O that men did vnderſtād this, they would not be ſo mad as to be ſtill inſatiable touching ye world: their owne experiēce would teach them, that nothing in this earth can content or ea
                     •
                  e their mind: am I not ſatiſfied with that which I haue ſéene and heard, or that others before me haue attayned? Then ſhall I neuer, for there is no new thing to be found out, in which a man may find good.
               Yea but men finde out thinges that be new. That is but our ignorance, for (ſaith he) there is no remembraunce of former things, alſo of things to come which ſhall be doone, there ſhall be no remembrance, with thoſe that ſhall be after. There be things which ſéeme new (I ſpeake of ſuch as men ſéeke felicitie in) but it is becauſe they are forgotten: ſo that the eye is neuer ſatiſfied, looking for new things, the eare that doth hearken after them: and thus are men inſatiable, but all in vaine, for in their new things where they ſéek
                     •
                  
                  
ſome good, they ſhall find nothing but old vanitie.
               O then brethren forſake your worldly cares, looke vpon your ſelues, yée are miſerable, looke vpon the creatures, they are in ſuch caſe as that they can not releeue yée, looke for nothing new among them that may content yée, &amp; ſettle your mind to ſay, I am now eaſed, it is a vaine ſtudie there is nothing new, there is nothing ſtable. Therefore ſéeke after the bleſſed God, to know him, to lay hold vpon him, and to poſſeſſe him, he ſhal ſuffice to make yée bleſſed, and to content your minde.

               The ſecond Sermon.
               
                  Eccleſiaſtes. Chap. 1.
                  
                     
                        I Eccleſiaſtes, was king ouerVerſe. 12. Iſrael in Ieruſalem.
                     13 I gaue my heart to inquire, and make ſearch in wiſdome concerning al that is wrought vnder the heauens. This euill trauaile hath God geuen to the ſonnes of men, to occupie them therein.
                     14 I ſawe all the workes which are wrought vnder the ſunne, and beholde, all is vanitie, and vexation of the Spirite.
                     15 That which is crooked, cannot be made ſtraight, and that which is wanting, cannot be numbred.
                     16 I ſpake in my heart, ſaying, I haue magnified, and increaſed wiſdome aboue

all that were before me in Ieruſalem, and my heart hath ſeene much wiſdome and knowledge.
                     17 And I gaue my hart to know wiſdome, and the knowledge of extreme madnes and follie. I know that euē this is affliction of ſpirite.
                     18 For, in the multitude of wiſdome there is much indignation, and he that increaſeth knowledge, increaſeth ſorrowe.
                  
               
               Eccleſiaſtes. Chap. 1.
               
                  
                     I Eccleſiaſtes, was king, &amp;c. In the former part of this Chapter we haue had two reaſons: the one drawen frō man himſelfe, the other from the things about which he laboureth, to proue that a man hath no profite, nor good at all, which remayneth of

all his ſore trauaile vnder the ſunne, and therefore all is vanitie of vanities.
               Now he procéedeth forward, to ſhew that he himſelfe made triall in all things vnder heauen, and found by full and perfect experience, that in déede, in all thoſe workes vnder the ſunne, wherein men doe ſéeke ſome good, there is nothing els but vanitie, miſerie, and vexation of ſpirite. This his procéeding is a plaine demonſtration, that the diſeaſe (I meane of ſetting our hearts vpon things tranſitorie) hath not onely taken déep roote in vs, but is alſo moſt peſtilēt and deadly. For, if it might eaſilie be cured, what néede ſhould there be of heaping vp all manner of proofs, and perſwaſions to draw away our hearts? And if it were not moſt deadly, why ſhould there be ſuch care taken about it?
               
                  Solomon did know right well by the holy ſpirite of the Lorde which guyded him, that all which can be ſaid, is little enough in this caſe: nay, the moſt are ſo bewitched, that it doeth not help them at all. But the proofe which is brought frō
                  
one mans experience, may ſéeme to be ouer weake and ſlender to moue all men in the world: euen the Princes, the riche, the wiſe and valiant, and to perſwade them to ceaſe from ſéeking good vnder the ſunne, for what is one man to try out all things to the full?
               In déede leaſt we ſhould thinke thus, before hee come to note what triall hee made, and ſo deliuer vnto vs what hee found, and what can be found, he ſpeaketh ſomewhat of his owne perſon, what hee was, and of what ablenes, and diligence.
               If it be ſuch a man which ſetteth forth his owne experience, as was throughlie able to ſearch out euerie matter, and alſo did it, and that in ſuch ſort, as all the men in the world (if they woulde ioyne together) cannot come nigh him, then may we be perſwaded by his experience. For, he is a foole that will thinke to finde that which he could not. Nowe in very déede, ſuch a one was Solomon.
               
               Firſt, he was a king, as he ſaith, I Eccleſiaſtes was king. If any in the world be able and fitte for this worke, they bée

kings. For they poſſeſſe the flower of all wherein there ſéemeth to bee any good. There can be no experiēce of that which a man hath not. He was king ouer Iſrael in Ieruſalem. This Iſrael was Gods choſen people, which he had magnified aboue all nations vnder heauen, and this was the citie of the great king, euen Ieruſalem.
               Here is a king higher then all ye kings of the earth. This man is not idle, but geueth himſelfe to ſearch out the workes that are wrought vnder the ſunne, to ſee what was in them. Yea, but hee might finde naught in ſome, &amp; yet in other ſome there might bee that which he ſawe not. Let no ſuch thought riſe in your minde, for looke whatſoeuer is done, or that all Princes in the worlde are able for to do, yea, and all mē whatſoeuer, he did ſearch it. For ſo he ſaith, that he gaue his heart to ſearche out all the workes which are wrought vnder heauen. Doe not thinke, that yee can light vppon any one thing worth the ſearch, which he hath not ſearched.
               
                  It may be further obiected, he that ſearcheth ſo many things, how can he doo them all well? To this he ſaith, that hee did ſearch by wiſdome. He was not deceiued, for wiſdome guided him in euery part, God gaue him both wiſdome and honour, and riches aboue all earthly creatures. He is a man euen made fitte of God himſelfe, to find out, and to tell vs what is in all the workes which are wrought vnder the Sunne. Let vs beléeue him: lette vs not follow the vayne fooles of the world which giue no credit vnto him, but ſéeke to find good where he could find none. He ſaith, it is an euill trauaile which God hath giuen to the ſons of men to be occupied in. He ſaith alſo, he beheld all, and all is vanitie and vexation of ſpirite.
               Do men I pray ye beléeue this? Why doo they then ſet their whole heart night and day vpon things that be tranſitorie? They labour, but bring not any thing to paſſe worth their ſore trauaile: they be vexed and tormented in vaine, (God hauing in his iuſtice for ſinne laid this euill

trauaile vppon Adams children) for hée ſaith, that which is crooked cānot be made ſtraight, and that which is wanting cannot be numbred. There is imbecillitie in mans workes, and that ſo great, that hée can not make that ſtraight which is crooked: there is ſuch imperfection, that the wants and defects are infinit. If he looke vpon the creatures, if he looke vpon him ſelfe, or vpon the ſucceſſe and euent of matters, all is crooked, he toileth but can not reforme it in any.
               All the creatures are wearie, ſubiect vnto vanitie, and vnto the bondage of corruption, they grone and trauaile in paine. Man laboureth in them to builde and ſet vp ſome ſure worke, but it will not be: for they decay, alter, and periſh. He can by no means withſtand or remedie this crookednes: his ſkill &amp; his power doo vtterly faile him herein. Man him ſelfe is more crooked, his mind depraued, full of vtter blindneſſe, the paſſions &amp; affections moſt vile and corrupt, the bodie baſe and ſubiect vnto all diſeaſes and incombrances: yea both mind and body euery

way in ſuch crookedneſſe as is vnſpeakeable. There is nothing ſtraight in him, all goeth crooked and peruerſe, hée worketh vpon himſelfe, and can make no part ſtraight. For all the humane Science and wiſdome vnder the heauens (if it were poſſible for one man to attaine and poſſeſſe it) is not able to giue him any ſparke of true light and knowledge of God, nor to clenſe or rid his ſoule from any one drop of that diueliſh poiſon wherwith it is infected &amp; depraued. Wiſe men might well, and did ſéeme to haue made themſelues much ſtraighter then the cō
                  mon ſort, but in very déed their crookedneſſe remained ſtill within.
               I ſpeake not of ſuch as are regenerate by Gods holy ſpirite, but of thoſe who were ledde onely by the light of nature. All their riches, their honour and power not able (they imploing their trauaile) to eaſe or recouer their bodies, to reſcue thē from the gout, or from an ague. The ſucceſſe of things is ſo croſſe and vnlucky, they foreſeing what they can, their ignorance by which they take many times

the wrong courſe, mans ſkil being ſo imperfect, doth cauſe ſuch infinite defectes, that Solomon beholding this in all the works wrought vnder the ſunne, he doth pronounce that all is vanitie &amp; vexation of ſpirit.
               How cléere is this, man hath ſuch imperfections, wantes, and errours in his workes as can not be numbred, all is crooked within him, without him, and about him, and he can make no one thing ſtraight: therfore all his labours are loſt, they be vaine, &amp; miſerable, carying with them ſo ſore affliction and vexation of the minde. Thus hath hée in generall pronounced, what he found in al the deuices, ſtudies, and workes, which are wrought vnder heauen.
               Now he procéedeth vnto particuler declaration: for hée goeth from point to point, ſhewing that in all the excellenteſt things vnder heauen, wherein there is any appéerāce or hope of good to be found, there did he make ſearch. And he did begin firſt of all with wiſedome: Becauſe in very déede, of all things tranſitorie, ſhe

is the flower. It is ſhe that maketh men to differre moſt one from another, and to excel.
               It falleth out oftentimes, that ſtarke fooles are riche, and in place of great honour. The bruite beaſtes doe enioy delight and pleaſures, as wel as men: but neither beaſt nor foole can poſſeſſe wiſdome, but onely the wiſe man. If there be any true worthines, felicitie, excellencie, or good to be found in the creatures vnder the ſunne, it is in wiſdome: therefore he ſaith, I applyed my hart to know wiſdome.
               It may be ſaid, that wiſdome, (euen humane wiſdome of which he now ſpeaketh) is high and déepe: who can ſearche into her treaſures? who ſhall finde, or be able to value what ſhe can affoord? Moſt true it is, that wiſdome is no eaſie thing to try. He muſt be no foole nor ſimple perſon: but he muſt poſſeſſe her, and that in excéeding great meaſure, which will diſcerne what her riches and pleaſures be.
               Marke therefore what hée ſaith, before he doeth tell that he applyed his hart

to know wiſdome. I ſaid in mine heart (ſaith he) behold, I haue magnified, and increaſed wiſdome aboue all that haue béen before me in Ieruſalē. Alſo, my hart hath ſéen much wiſdom and knowledge, becauſe God had indued him with greater wiſdome and knowledge, than any man vnder heauen, he doeth gather therby, that hee was the fitteſt for this purpoſe. He doeth encourage himſelfe, and maketh it knowen vnto all, that he was thus ſet forward. He ſearcheth not at aduenture, he ſearcheth not in the darke, he hath his rule and his candle in his hand, euen the light and direction of wiſdome her ſelfe. The wiſeſt man vnder heauē ſearcheth out wiſdome: yea, I may ſay more, let the wiſdome of al the wiſe men in the world be laid together, it commeth ſhort of his.
               Some haue béene greatly wiſe in the courſe of the heauens, ſome in the knowledge of nature in all creatures here belowe, ſome ſubtile Logicians, ſome eloquent Orators to perſwade; ſome politike in making lawes to gouerne Cities

and commonwealths. Others haue béen famous and renowmed for the ſkill of other noble ſciences, as euery mans heart led him: ſome to one, and ſome to another. In all theſe he hath ſurmounted thē far, if they were layde together. Hee ſawe more, he did know more, and coulde tell more then all they. He was in déede the wonder of the world. The Quéen of Saba wondered at his wiſdome, vntil there was no ſpirite in her, 1. Kings 10. Confeſſing1. King. 10 that ſhe did not beléeue that which ſhe heard of him, vntill ſhe came and ſaw it with her eyes, and moreouer, that the one halfe was not tolde her. Hée excelled the fame that went of him. Then behold, here is the man which muſt tell vs what good is to be found in all the wiſdome and ſkill of this worlde. He did abound in al manner of wiſdome, &amp; thereby gaue his heart to know her.
               Moreouer as he was wiſe, ſo he tooke a good and perfect way to make a full ſearch. It is expreſſed in theſe▪ words, I gaue my hart to know wiſdome, and the knowledge of extreme madneſſe and follie.

This is certaine, that euery thing is moſt perfectly manifeſted and knowen, by the contrarie. As for example: A man could neuer find ſo well the comfort and benefit of the light, if he were not ſometimes compaſſed about with darkeneſſe. We beſt féele the ſwéete, when we haue firſt taſted the ſower. Health is more cō
                  fortable after gréeuous ſickneſſe, the pure white ſheweth the brighter, when it is ſet by the blacke: euen ſo wiſdome ſheweth the greater glory, whē extreme madneſſe and follie are ſet by her.
               For this cauſe Solomon (to the end he might behold this goodly lady wiſdome in her full beautie, and commoditie,) ſetteth by her extreme madneſſe and follie. For together with the ſight of this euill fauoured and deformed bedlem, with all her inconueniences, the vew of wiſdome doth ſet her out moſt excellently. All her brightneſſe, all that ſhe hath to delight, or to benefit, are diſplayed. We may ſée then what ladde him to applie his hart to know extreme madneſſe, or all kindes of madneſſe, (for he vſeth the word in the

plurall number) and fooliſhneſſe. It was not any loue that he bare vnto them, but to finde out the perfection of wiſedome through the knowledge of theſe. For by the vglines of madneſſe &amp; follie, the pleaſant countenance of wiſdome is more delightſome and amiable. The harmes, the inconueniences, and miſchiefes which grow from thoſe, to the annoyance of all mad raging fooles: doo make knowen and manifeſt, what good, what treaſures and cōmodities this wiſdome doth bring vnto him that doth poſſeſſe her.
               May we not thinke that Solomon did now beholde as it were an Angell in brightneſſe and glorie, which might fill the mind with conſolation &amp; happineſſe: but marke what hée pronounceth in the next words following: I know alſo that this is affliction of ſpirite. What can be more plaine? There is a ſhew of good to be attained by humane wiſdome, &amp; men are wonderfullie allured and drawen in hope thereof: but when it commeth to the proofe, they haue loſt all their labour, there is naught but a méere illuſion, the

good is vaniſhed. What doe they find in ſtéed thereof? Looke what he fonnd, euen affliction of ſpirite, ſhall they find any better.
               It may ſéeme very ſtrange &amp; abſurd, that this wiſdome, which hath alwaies beene ſo extolled, magnified, and honored of all nations in the world: ſo loued and imbraced of kings: ſo ſet forth and bewtified with all the iewels and ornaments that might be by the ſkilfull and learned of all ſortes, ſhould thus be abaſed, as to be made but an illuſion and a vaine deceipt, which in ſtéed of good ſo ſought and hoped for▪ doth bring nothing but afflictiō of the ſpirit. The wiſe men of this world haue in all ages thought their labours aboundantly recompenſed by wiſdome.
               
                  Solomon which had more then they all, pronounceth, that it hath nothing but affliction of ſpirite. How commeth ſuch contrarietie of iudgement? Doubtleſſe from their blindneſſe, they ſaw not that which he ſaw. Their eyes were daſeled with preſent glory and commodities: he beheld that it could not further a man vnto

true bleſſedneſſe in the kingdome of God. He did behold the weakeneſſe and imperfection which is in it, being vnable to make that ſtraight which is crooked, eſpecially in the depraued heart of man. So then let all her fréends ſet her out to the vttermoſt of their ſkill, &amp; paint forth her prayſes in the freſheſt colours that they can: yet ſhall the ſentence of this one man preuaile againſt them. He did know her more perfectly then all they, he giueth the right ſentence, they are deceiued. They ſay there is great good, he ſaith I know that this alſo is affliction of ſpirit. And he rendreth a reaſon thus: for in the aboundance of wiſdome, there is aboundance of indignation, and he that increaſeth knowledge increaſeth ſorrow.
               
               He that would be in felicitie, muſt not ſéeke it in ſorrowes and griefes of minde and bodie: but in things that are ſwéete and pleaſant. Happineſſe is in ioy &amp; conſolation, bitterneſſe and anguiſh are contrarie thereunto. Then muſt it néeds follow, that all thoſe are deceiued vtterly,

which ſéeke felicitie in humane wiſdome. Becauſe the more wiſdome aboundeth, the more doth indignation abound (as he did féele) and he that increaſeth his ſkill, it is with ſore trauaile, and it is full of ſorowes. There may be many cauſes of trouble and diſturbance of the mind with indignatiō where wiſdome doth abound. For he ſhall ſée that there is no end, but an infinite trouble, queſtion vpon queſtion will ariſe, the wants &amp; the aukneſſe of matters will torment.
               Againe, with what infinite trauaile and care of mind and bodie, is knowledge come by? how haue men ſtudied and wearied themſelues all the daies of their life, to get knowledge? who is able to expreſſe the paines which the Philoſophers did take, and yet none of them able to excell in all, but in ſome péeces as their affections chiefly drew them. He that will be a perfect Logician, to haue the full vſe of naturall reaſon in perfect rules, it is not the worke of a few daies, nor yet of a few yeares. It muſt be with long trauaile, euen all his life, &amp; yet he ſhal come ſhort.

Coſmographers, in deſcribing all partes of this world, the heauens, the earth, and the things that be in them, haue no ſmall worke in hande. Come to theſe which ſearch to knowe the nature &amp; properties of all creatures, where ſhall they euer come to ſée towarde an ende of their trauaile? They be in a bottomleſſe ſea with out ſhoare. How muſt thoſe ſtudie, how many hiſtories, volumes, &amp; bookes, muſt they turne ouer, which will come to bée ſound Politikes, to be furniſhed for the gouernment of Cities and Commonweales, and for the warres? Looke vnto all others which trauaile in any ſcience, and the paines of ſuch as will excell in déede, are wonderfull. Here is trauaile, here is care, here is indignation, here is wearines and gréefe vpon gréefe, here is no ende, here is no perfection attayned, here is no ſetling, or quieting of ye minde, all doeth vaniſh as ſmoke, there remayneth no good at all.
               Thus we ſée the ſentence of the wiſe man himſelfe, concerning all the ſkil and knowledge vnder the ſunne. I knowe

fleſh and bloud will here riſe vp. Wiſdome will not ſuffer this diſgrace, but will pleade for her ſelfe.
               Firſt it will be obiected, that this is a weak reaſon, there is no wiſdome attayned vnto but with ſorrowes, therefore wiſdome is vanitie, and vexation of ſpirite. Men may goe through infinite labours and gréefes willingly, to enioy ſo precious a iewell. Their laboures are wel ſpent, they be fully recompenced. To haue the eſtimation and honor of a wiſe man, is no ſmall benefite. Knowledge filleth the minde with delight, ſo that it forgetteth the ſorowes ſuſtayned in trauayling.
               I anſwere, that there are no labours, nor ſorrowes ſuſtained for true felicity, which can any thing impaire the ſame, the ioy of that will ſurmount them all: it is moſt happie labour that is ſo ſpent. But in theſe things there is no true ioy, but a ſhadow. It is the loue of vainglory that hath caried mē forward to take ſuch paines, and ſo ſore to vexe and torment themſelues. All their ioy and comfort reſteth

in this, that they may haue fame &amp; glorie in this worlde. If this glory bee 
                     •
                  aine and tranſitorie, how doth it recom

                  ence their labours and gréefes? If there 
                     •
                  emaine no good, is not all vanitie, &amp; vexation of ſpirite?
               Let vs examine it in ſome particu
                  
                     •
                  ars. Cicero and Demoſthenes were eloquent Orators: how wiſe, and how ſwéet was their ſpéech? They could delight the 
                     •
                  are, and perſwade the minde. But can their eloquence now perſwade, to haue their torments mitigated, or to be let out of the priſon of hell? Alas, what can their ſmoothe tongues benefite them now? their fame doeth them no good. Solon and Lycurgus could make wiſe lawes, and make men partakers of great fréedomes, but they can purchaſe no infranchiſemēt to themſelues, from the miſerable bondage of eternall deſtruction. Ariſtotle could diſpute ſubtillie, let him now ſhew his cunning to acquitte himſelfe. Iulius Caeſar, Scipio, and Hanniball, were expert and valiant warriors, but what can their ſharpe ſwordes helpe them nowe?

They coulde ouercome men, but not deuils.
               We may ſée that all the paynes an
                     •
                   vexations to attaine worldly ſkil, are n
                     •
                   way recompenſed but vtterly loſt. Th
                     •
                   parties haue but deceiued themſelue
                     •
                   with vaine glory and pride, they haue made great account of that which is nothing worth. For it is not any good tha
                     •
                   they haue found, which made the Philoſophers and great wiſe men ſo to labour, but an opinion that their glory ſhould neuer be darkened, &amp; that this glory was the chiefe thing to be ſought.
               It ſéemeth ſo ſtill vnto men, and that it is a moſt abiect nature which can not taſt it. In déede vnto ſuch as can not ſée farre of, as S. Peter ſpeaketh. 2. Pet. 1.
                  2. Pet. 1. but haue the beames of their ſight determined within the limites of this world, it muſt néedes be all in all, and the thing which they doe thirſt after. But if they could ſée thus farre, that all this glorie ſhall doe a man no good, when he goeth downe into the darke pit of hell, it would alter their minde. For he which paſſeth

through that gate muſt leaue his traine behind him, he muſt put of his robes of honour, &amp; lay aſide his weapons of war.
               This will ſome ſay is nothing to the purpoſe, theſe were Heathen men whom ye haue named, they knew not God. A man may haue al this glory, and the glorie of heauen alſo, as many haue had. That is moſt true, that a man may haue the glory of this world, and the glory of heauē alſo, and that ſome haue had both, or elſe were it wide with Dauid, and Solomon, &amp; many other. But yet we muſt note this, that thoſe be no other then as Heathen, which delight and glorie in the pompe of this world, and account them fooles which cannot (as they ſay) taſt this glorie.
               Lette not the wiſe man glorie in his wiſedome, nor the ſtrong man in his ſtrength, nor the rich man in his riches. But he that glorieth, lette him glory in this, that he hath vnderſtanding &amp; knoweth me, &amp;c. Ierem. 9. Our Sauiour ſpeakethIerem. 9. in this wiſe of thoſe which ſéeke the glorie of this world, Ioh. 5. How can yeIohn. 5.
                  
beléeue which ſéeke glorie one of another, and ſéeke not the glorie which commeth of God alone? Whereby it is manifeſt, that ſuch as ſet their hearts to ſéeke the honour that is of men, be Infidels. The godly men, as king Dauid and others which had the glorie of this world, made it not their delight and glorie, but gloried in the Lord. Yet it will be ſaid, that this doctrine is abſurd: For is not wiſdome and knowledge in the noble Artes and Sciences, the gift of God? are they not helpes then, and furtherances to approch néerer vnto God, and vnto true glorie? I anſwere that they be good giftes of God, &amp; where the corrupt nature of man doth not hinder, they be helps vnto higher and better things.
               But Solomon doth not diſpute what this wiſdome is in it ſelfe, but whether a man can attaine any true felicitie by it? Which he denieth, for though it benefit a man for the preſent, as touching worldly cōmodities, yet it is no true good becauſe it is tranſitorie &amp; doth vaniſh. It is gotten with ſorrowes and vexations, ſo that

a little ſwéet is mixed with a great deale of ſower. It is neuer perfect, neither cā it make that ſtraight which is crooked. It is ſo farre from bringing a man néerer vnto God, that it caſteth men further frō him, as the ſtate of man is now. For it ſetteth vp man in pride, and to glorie in himſelfe. It is ſo blind touching ſpirituall &amp; heauenly myſteries, in which God reuealeth the knowledge of himſelf vnto ſaluation, that it is not onely not capable of them, but doth blaſphemouſly and madly condemne them to be fooliſhneſſe, as the holy Apoſtle teacheth. 1. Cor 2. the1. Cor. 2. reaſons &amp; cogitations which come from the wiſdome of this world, or from the fleſh, are compared vnto holdes and munitions, &amp; high things which exalt themſelues againſt the knowledge of Chriſt, which the Goſpell muſt throw downe when it turneth mē vnto God. 2. Cor. 10.

                   wiſe of this ſort, but their owne ſkil. All muſt be meaſured by that, and look what ſoeuer doeth not ſquare with it, is condemned.
               From hence it commeth, that among the prudent after the fleſh, few are called to inherite the kingdome of God, as we
                     •
                   are taught 1. Cor 1. It is ſo hard a thing1. Cor. 1. to bring them to be fooles.
               It will be replyed here againe, that

this is more abſurde then the former, namely, to cōfeſſe that euen humane wiſdome is Gods gift, a thing therefore good and commendable, and withal to affirme that it doth not bring men néerer vnto God, but caſteth them further back. Can a good thing be the cauſe of euill? I anſwer: that a good thing cannot be blamed iuſtly to be the cauſe of euill. We doe not affirme that the knowledge and ſkill of all that is vnder the Sunne, is in it ſelfe the cauſe that menne are caried further from God, but mans corrupt nature is the cauſe which dooth peruert &amp; abuſe it, as it doth the beſt things of all vnto deſtruction. As for example, the law is good,Rom. 7. the commandement is holy, iuſt, &amp; pure, ſaith the Apoſtle. And yet it is called the miniſtrie of condemnation, the letter that2. Cor. 3. killeth, and the ſtrength of ſinne. Is that which is holy and ordeined for life, made1. Cor. 15. ſinne, or the cauſe of ſinne, or death? Looke how the Apoſtle anſwereth, Rom. 7.
                  Rom. 7. Sinne doth take occaſion, and worketh all manner of concupiſcence by the commandement.
               
                  It tooke occaſion by the law, and ſeduced me, and ſiue me. Yea, he ſheweth that ſinne through the law doth become out of meaſure ſinfull. And what ſhall wee ſay further, doth not the vile nature of man abuſe the grace of God it ſelf? Why doth the Apoſtle ſay, ſhall we continue in ſin that grace may abound? God forbid. Ro. 6. Why doth he giue this admonition,Rom. 6. brethren ye are called vnto libertie, only make not your libertie an occaſion to the fleſh. Gal. 5. but that there is ſo vile corruption in men by nature, as that they will make the leſſe regard of committing ſinne, becauſe ſinnes are fréely pardoned by the bloud of Chriſt. Shall wée then maruaile that the wiſdome of this world, though in it ſelf good, doo not bring men néerer vnto God, but carrie them further from him. Yet how will ſome man ſay?
               Firſt thus, the more a man is lifted vp in pride, &amp; doth glorie in him ſelfe, the further he is remooued from God. For God abhorreth the proude, and beholdeth him a farre of, yea he doth ſet himſelfe

againſt him, or reſiſt him as S. Peter teacheth. It is not poſſible for man by nature1. Pet. 5. but to be puffed vp, and to glorie in naturall vnderſtanding. And therefore we ſée that men which are of great wiſdome for the direction of earthly things, in lawes, in policies, and in artes, doe ſo much glorie in thēſelues as if they were the flower of men, ſo long as they be not regenerate. Then alſo they be the hardeſt of all other, to be brought for to yéeld to the heauenly wiſdome. For they be full and rich already. Who ſhall admoniſh, who ſhal teach, who ſhall inſtruct or controll them?
               Here will great diſpleaſure be taken. For will ſome wiſe men ſay, this doctrine doth tend to the deſtruction of all the noble ſciences: for who will take the paines if he may not haue the honour? Nay to heare that they doo carrie a man further from God. It will alſo be the ouerthrow of commonwelths. For where ſhall become our wiſe politikes, and valiant warriours? If honour be brought into contempt, then farewell al. We ſhal

haue none but fooles and cowardes. Will men aduenture their liues if it were not for glorie wil they ſtudie if they may not haue praiſe? Is not this ſuch a miſchiefe as is intollerable? I anſwere, that in verie déed, to ouerthrow common-wealths, or to deſtroy noble ſciences, is a miſchiefe intollerable. But to ſay that it will be ſo, vnleſſe men may ſéeke the praiſe and glory of the world, is a reaſon not good among chriſtians.
               Among Turkes or Heathen where there is no other thing to lead them forward, it might well be allowed: among vs it is to be accounted as flat Atheiſme: we are to ſéeke the glory of God, and not vaine glorie. I may reaſon thus: If a Pagan would take ſuch paines in ſtudie, for ſkill &amp; wiſdome, &amp; aduēture his life in the wars for the glorie and praiſe of mē. How much more ought a chriſtian man, to do the like to glorifie &amp; ſerue his God? God ſaith he will honour thoſe which honour1. Sam. 2. him: their glorie ſhall laſt for euer. The other which ſought for to glorifie themſelues ſhall lie couered in ſhame,

when their vaine praiſe ſhall vaniſhe: There haue béene men as wiſe and poli
                  
                     •
                  ike for gouernment, and as valiant for warre as euer any other, which ſought not the praiſe of men, but with true feare 
                     •
                  o ſerue and glorifie their God, as Iehoſua, Dauid, and Solomon, with many others. And it is a bad mind of thoſe which will not allow humilitie, becauſe they 
                     〈…〉
                   it maketh men fooles and cowards.
               Let vs ſée then, when as Solomon doth affirme that in all the wiſdome vnder heauē there is no good, there is no fe

                  icitie, there is naught but vanitie and affliction of ſpirite, he doeth not condemne the ſkill of this world, but doeth ſet it in the due place. It is profitable for the affaires of this life: it may be an handmaid to doo ſeruice vnto the true heauenly wiſdome. But when ſhe is ſet vp as a iudge and controller in heauenly matters, or as Hagar doth aduance her ſelfe, and deſpiſe Sara her Ladie, that is grieuous. All this is wickedly performed, when men doe glorifie it, reſt in it, couet to be aduanced by it, deſpiſing in reſpect thereof

the true knowledge of God. And herein behold the wickedneſſe of men: the knowledge of Philoſophie and worldly wiſdome is ſo highly eſtéemed, and ſo bewtifull and precious in their eies, that they haue more delight in it by many degrées, then in the heauenly knowledge. This doeth appéere by their ſtudies.
               How ſwéete vnto them are Tullies orations, and Ariſtotels politikes, when as the Pſalmes of Dauid, the Prouerbes of Solomon, or Paules Epiſtles, are but as drie chips. Theſe are neglected, there is no pain or trauaile vndertakē about thē, there is no ſwéetneſſe in them. About the other for the wiſdome of this world, there is vnſpeakable toile. Bookes vpō bookes, volumes vpon volumes, ſtudie vpon ſtudie, and happie men if they can ſo come to excell in ſome one thing. For why? they ſuppoſe, they haue gotten feathers of gold to make them goodly wings for to mount aloft in this world. For the wealth and glory of this worlde is in their eye, the chiefe matter.
               Alas poore vaine men, that they had

the wiſdom to conſider well what is here ſpoken, Vanitie of vanities, all is vanitie: yea euen wiſdome it ſelfe. For it bringeth much ſorrowe both to body &amp; mind, and can but aduance in this worlde, the ſhape of which paſſeth away. It would make them alter their ſtudies, and deuide them ſo, that their chéefe laboures would be for the heauenlie wiſdom. For beholding the vanitie of all the glory vnder the ſunne, it would cauſe them to ſet their hearts vpon the true glorie, and to ſéek for it ten times more carefully then for that. Which the Lord geue vs grace to doe,
               Amen.

               The thirde Sermon.

                        I Said in my heart, goe to now, I will powre foorth with mirth, therefore take thou pleaſure in that that is pleaſant. But behold alſo, this is vanitie.
                     2 I ſaid of laughter, it is mad, and of mirth, what is it that ſhe doeth?
                     3 I ſought in my minde to draw out my fleſh in wine, and leading my heart in wiſdome, and to take holde of follie, vntill I ſawe whether this be the good to the ſonnes of men, which they are to doe vnder the heauens, the number of the dayes of their life.
                     4 I made my works great, I built me houſes, I planted me vineyardes.
                     5 I made me gardens, and orchardes,

in which I planted trees of all manner of fruite.
                     6 I made me ciſterns of water, to water therewith the wood, ſpringing vp with trees.
                     7 I gate me menſeruants, and maideſeruants, and had children borne in the houſe: alſo, I had poſſeſsion of cattle, &amp; flockes, great aboue all that were before me in Ieruſalem.
                     8 I heaped vp for me alſo ſiluer and golde, and the peculiar of kings, and of the prouinces: I gate me men ſingers, and women ſingers, the delightes of the childrē of men, all manner of harmony.
                     9 And I was great, and increaſed aboue all that were before me in Ieruſalem: alſo, my wiſdome did abide with me.
                     10 And whatſoeuer mine eyes deſired, I withhelde it not from them, I kept not back my hart from any ioy, but my heart reioyced ouer all my labour, and this was my portion of all my trauel.
                     11 I looked then vnto al the workes which my hands had wrought, and vnto

the trauaile in which I trauailed to doe, and behold, all is vanitie, and vexation of ſpirite, and there is no profit vnder the ſunne.
                     12 Then I turned to beholde wiſdome, and extreme madnes and follie, for, what ſhall the man doe that ſhal folow the king? euen that which is done alreadie.
                     13 I ſaw that there is profite in wiſdom more then in folly, as there is profite in light aboue the darke.
                     14 The wiſe mans eyes are in his head, but the fool walketh in the darke.
                  
               
               Eccleſiaſtes. Chap. 2.
               
                  
                     ISaide in my heart, goe to now, &amp;c. We haue alreadie ſéene in the former Chapter, that Solomon, firſt of all, ſearched out wiſdome,

and found no good therein, but ſorrowes. Now therfore, he turneth to ſéek elſwhere. And firſt vnto pleſures, which he ſtaieth not in, but by and by deteſteth. And ſo he cōmeth to a third courſe, which is this. He mixed wiſdome and pleaſures together. But he doeth conclude, that although he found in this way ſome good in both, yet not ſuch, but that he ſawe all to be vanitie, and vexation of ſpirit. For the good be founde, is but for the preſent time.
               But let vs come to his words for that former, he ſtirreth vp himſelfe vnto delights and pleaſures, to ſée whether ther be in them the felicitie that mē ſhall haue vnder the heauens. And to the ende wée may vnderſtande that he ſearched euen to the bottome of al pleaſures &amp; delights, he vſeth a ſpéech to expreſſe the ſame as vehemently as might be. For hee doeth not ſay, I wil geue my ſelfe to pleaſure, which might be done with ſome moderation, and ſo he ſhoulde not ſearch déepe enough: but he ſaith, I will powre foorth with pleaſure▪
                   that is, he wil▪ wholy giue

ouer, or power foorth himſelf, or his hart vnto pleaſure. And ſo he willeth his hart (euen as it were letting loſe al ye raines) to take pleaſure in that which is pleſant. This is very néedefull to be conſidered, becauſe our nature is addicted vnto delights and pleaſures, and men do greatly couet them, imagining that there is felicitie in them, they be ſo ſwéete vnto the fleſh.
               If Solomon had but taſted, or vſed moderation in pleaſures, we might haue ſaid, what can he tel how great good there is to be found in delights? But when hée poured foorth, and gaue ouer him ſelfe whollie (for the time) vnto them, what doubt remayneth, or can remaine? He was a great king, wanting nought, but hauing at wil and commandement what he would for all lawfull delights. No other king in the world able to doe ye like. He put foorth himſelfe, &amp; did what might be done. And now hauing proued, marke what he ſaith: Beholde, this alſo is vanitie.
               
               He ſtayeth not here, in pronouneing

all carnall delights and pleaſures to bée vanitie, but ſheweth alſo, that he did euē ldath them with contempt and indignation.
               
                  I ſaid (ſaith he) of laughter, it is mad, and of mirth, what doeth ſhe? Being marueylous wiſe, it gréeued him excéedingly to be carried ſo farre awrie, and out of the way, as to be made a foole, a mad man, or a beaſt. Nowe he ſaw that pleaſures, (which he vnderſtandeth by laughter) doe in déede make thoſe euen brutiſh, and mad fooles, which are geuen ouer vnto them. That is the cauſe why he ſaith laughter is mad, which is not to be vnderſtoode only what it is in it ſelfe, but what it maketh men. It carieth men which are poured foorth thereunto, euen to the forgetfulnes of God, and to quēch all light of true vnderſtanding in them. Thus then he reaſoneth: felicity, or good, is not to be ſought in that which maketh a man forget God, quencheth the light of reaſon, turneth him into a beaſt, or maketh him mad. But carnall pleaſures do all theſe, when a man doeth poure foorth

him ſelfe vnto them, therefore they are to be deſpiſed, abhorred, and reiected.
               A wiſe man may wel ſay of mirth as he doeth: what doeth ſhe? as if it ſhould be ſaid, ſhe doeth marre at, leadeth cleane awry, and leaueth no good. In this point there is little credite giuen, or like to bée giuen vnto Solomon. For almoſt the whole world doth giue ouer it ſelfe vnto vaine mirth and pleaſures. There is ſuch a ſwéetneſſe in them vnto the fleſh, that ye ſhall ſcarce find the tenth man, among noble or baſe, which doth not thinke himſelfe euen after a ſort happie, if he may inioy euen the ſcumme or dregges of them.
               I ſpeake thus, becauſe in compariſon of Solomons pleaſant delights, all the pleaſures which the common ſort of men attaine vnto, are but euē as the ſcumme. And what is the cauſe that we can not beléeue him, but doo ſtill follow after carnall pleaſures, as gréedily as euer hungry fiſhes doo catch at the bait? Surely this is the cauſe, men are fooles, and ſo it gréeueth them not to be made beaſtes or

madde men, as it gréeued him being wiſe. Is this the way to happineſſe? O miſerable blindnes. Men are now (as the holy Apoſtle prophecied, they ſhould be in the laſt daies) louers of pleaſures, more then louers of God. 2. Timoth. 3. Let vs2. Tim. 3. take héed of it, ſeing it is but a vaine illuſion, and no more but as the dreame of a ſick man. He dreameth that he ſéeth pleaſant ſights, &amp; heareth goodly ſongs which delight him, but when he awaketh, he is in his bed full of paine: pleaſures for the time carrie men on as happie, but in the end they ſhall find they were deluded.
               I may here reaſon by compariſon after this ſort: If lawfull mirth or that which is indifferent in it ſelfe, doo make men to become madde and baſe minded, when they be giuen ouer thereunto, not kéeping moderation, for power forth thy ſelfe and thou ſhalt become madde, how much more ſhall filthie and vnlawfull, or impure delights make them brutiſh? for we muſt not thinke that king Solomon did poure foorth himſelfe vnto vncleane mirth: but vnto ſuch pleaſures as are

déemed honeſt. And they that are carried away with theſe become madde, and baſe minded, their felicitie being all one with the beaſts. Then wée know not whereunto for to likē thoſe which make a ſport of ſinne, and ſport themſelues with wickedneſſe. Some of them delight in pride, painting forth thēſelues by all the waies and meanes which they can, that they may ſéeme goodly in the eyes of men. Others follow gluttonie and drunkennes, cramming and ſtuffing their bellies like ſwine. Others ſolace thēſelues in whoredome &amp; vncleannes, theſe be their ſwéet delights. Solomon did not giue himſelfe to ſuch pleaſures.
               Theſe be more then madde, for they drinke in poiſon only becauſe it is ſwéet, euen the moſt peſtilent and deadly poyſon and bane, both of ſoule &amp; body: therefore it is ſaid, the foole maketh a ſporte of ſinne. Moſes is commended for great wiſdome, Hebr. 11. When he did refuſeHebr 11. to be called the ſonne of Pharoes daughter, chooſing rather to ſuffer afflictiō with the people of God, then to inioy the pleaſures

of ſinne for a ſeaſon, eſtéeming the rebuke of Chriſt greater riches, then theHebr. 11. treaſures of Egipt. I would all kings, princes, nobles, &amp; great men of the earth, did know that which king Solomon doth teach in this place. Yea I would all men did cōſider it a right. Thē ſhould we not haue the deuiſers of vaine delights ſo much made of, wée ſhould not haue ſo much coſt &amp; ſo much time ſpent in vaine mirth.
               I will now procéede vnto that which doth follow, beyng the third ſearch that he made to find good. He ſaith he tooke vpon him to drāwe forth his fleſh in wine (that is to my ſwéete delights and pleaſures) for wine being one of the chief delicates, is as a parte vſed for the whole. But he would doe this (as he ſaith) leading his hart in wiſdome and taking hold of follie. That is he will ioyne wiſdome and delights together. The ſtudie of wiſdome did carrie with it as much increaſe of indignation and ſorrow, as of knowledge, ſo the more knowledge, the more ſorrow, and being tranſitorie how ſhould

it bring felicitie or good, yea euen for the time preſent? felicity, as was ſaid before, is a ſwéete thing, it is not in griefes and vexatiōs. To come then vnto pleaſures, there may be felicitie in them, for they are ſwéete &amp; delicate, they bring delight. He powreth forth his heart vnto them, they make him madde. If felicitie be to be found in brutiſh madneſſe, they can afford it.
               Whether ſhall he ſéeke now, he hath failed in theſe two former? he doth therfore take a third courſe, and doth make a mixture, and ioyne them both together. The pleaſures &amp; delights ſhall aſſwage, and delay the ſorrowes which goe with the increaſe of wiſdome: and ſo the bitternes of them ſhall not be felt. Againe, wiſdome ſhall be as a bridle to moderate the pleaſures, to auoid the fooliſh madnes, which other wiſe they doo bring. So that now he goeth about to prooue what is in theſe, when both thoſe former euils are ſalued. He will neither be beſotted, or made abrutiſh foole by the one, neither tormented by ſorrowes with the other.

Here ye ſée a moſt excellent wiſe way, and in déede as we ſhall ſée afterward, ye good that is to be found is in this courſe.
               It may be ſaid, that he, ioyning them thus together, the one might be an impediment to the other. For either his aboū
                  dant wiſdome would not ſuffer him to take pleaſure (filling him full of moroſitie) or elſe his great pleaſures could not but carrie him awrie from wiſdomes lore: therefore marke what he ſaith, for in déed neither of them hindred the other. His pleaſures ſhould be to the full, and wheras he profeſſeth, for he would draw out or continue his fleſh in wine, that is in delights. He would alſo lead his heart in wiſdome, and take hold of follie, then pleaſure ſhall not make him madde: wée haue ſéene before why this is added, that hée would take hold of follie.
               And ſo here he doth let vs vnderſtand, that in both theſe together he waded déeply, yea moſt déepely, vntill (as he ſaith) he might ſée whether this be the good that the ſonnes of men are to inioy vnder the heauens, the number of the daies of their

life, whether a man may find good vnder the heauens in wiſedome, and delights mixed together?
               Thus hauing declared the purpoſe of his minde, he ſheweth how he did practiſe the ſame. For looke what ſerued for honour, for royaltie, and magnificence, he ſet it vp. Nothing was omitted which might miniſter comfort and ioy, in lawfull and honeſt delightes. Wiſdome alſo ſhewed her ſelfe euery where in all his labours. For, according to the power of a king, and the ſame the greateſt in glorie, riches, and wiſdome vnder heauen, he made his workes great and magnificall. He did builde faire and ſtately Palaces, goodly houſes, none ſuch (in euerie reſpect) to be ſéene in the world. He planted vineyardes, he made him gardens &amp; orchards, in which he planted al manner of fruitful trees, euen of all the beſt fruits that could be gotten in the earth. Into theſe the pleaſant ſwéet ſtreams of freſh waters, were deuided by conductes, or pipes, into ciſterns, for to water the trées and plants.
               
                  He had (as he ſaith) great riches, aboue all that were before him in Ieruſalem, He had a great familie, of men ſeruants, maidſeruants, and children born of them in the houſe. He had ſtore of cattle, as, of ſhéepe and oxen. He heaped vp golde and ſiluer, &amp;. the peculiar treaſures of kinges, and of the prouinces: euen ſuch treaſures as none but kings and potentates are able to poſſeſſe, for the great price of them.
               Furthermore, he had the ſwéeteſt melodie that might be: for he had men ſingers, and womē ſingers, and (as he ſaith) the delights of the children of men, all maner of muſicall harmonie: which is tranſlated in our engliſh bible, a woman taken captiue, &amp; women taken captiues. The words be Schiddah, and Schiddoth Now, Schadad is to ſpoyl, and lay waſt, but here it is vnfitly taken in that ſence, of a womā, or women takē captiues. He ſpake of men ſingers, and womē ſingers, and then no doubt hee addeth the muſike of the inſtrumentes, which was vſed together with their voice. And to note that

he had not common muſike, he ſaith, the delights of the children of men, harmonie, and harmonies: as much as to ſay, all maner of harmonie, and noyſes of muſike, the ſwéeteſt inſtruments that might be, being ioyned together. And the words which he vſeth, doo very fitly expreſſe the matter, becauſe in the harmonie of muſike, many diuers ſoundes meeting together, are (as it were) waſted eache of other, and doe make all one tune. And ſo he calleth it Schiddah, and Schiddoth.
               
               Thus we may ſee, that there was nothing vnder the heauens, either beutifull vnto the eye, ſweete and pleaſant to the taſte, or delight ſome vnto the eare, but he had it. And for the ſame purpoſe he telleth more then once, I was great, and increaſed aboue all that were before mee in Ieruſalem. But doeth he (as he purpoſed) inioy pleaſures, and yet lead his hart in wiſdome, for that is the thing he profeſſed to vndertake. He affirmeth that he did. His delights did not carie him into fooliſh madnes, for he ſaith, verſe 10. yet my wiſdom did abide ſtill with mee.
                  
But did not his wiſdome withholde him from taking ſolace? In no wiſe, for hee ſaith, All that mine eyes deſired, I kept not back from them, I witheld not my hart from any ioy. Behold then, as hee purpoſed, ſo doeth he bring to paſſe. Hée ioyneth wiſdome and delights together. Mirth and laughter ſhall not make him mad. He wil not ſo forget himſelfe, to be caried with ſenſualitie and voluptuouſnes, as to be made a beaſt. His wiſdome did ſtill continue with him, and guide his heart.
               Againe, he did not vexe himſelfe with indignation and ſorow, for the multiplying of knowledge, and ſo withdrawe him ſelfe from pleaſures. For, whatſoeuer his eye deſired, whatſoeuer his heart wiſhed for in any lawfull mirth, he was able to haue what he would, he did not denie the ſame.
               Sée then how he was lifted vp touching all the excellent thinges vnder the ſunne. He did flow, and ſwim in wealth, in pleaſures, in honour, and wiſdome. He had al that hart can wiſh. If theſe things

be able to reléeue, or to eaſe mans miſerie, he is happie by them. He wanteth not, nor is not ſcanted. Let all kings and princes now looke vpon him, and harken what he ſaith, for he commeth now to tel what he found in all theſe.
               He confeſſeth in déede, that in this way he receiued commoditie. And firſt touching the delights, that he withhelde not his heart from any ioy. He ſaith it was his portion of all his labour. Wherby he doeth vs to witte, that there is no more to be had but for a temporall profite. He is to haue but his part, and then when he hath lefte all behinde, another doeth take his part: and ſo along ſtil from one to another. There is no man which will maintayne, that after death any one is the better ſor the delights which he liued in. For the preſent time there is profite, being vſed in ſuch ſort, as that they doe not quench the light of the mind, and drowne it in ſecuritie, and other filthie ſinnes. For God hath geuen men ye lawful vſe of his creatures, not onely for neceſſitie, but alſo for delight and pleaſure.

As he hath appointed that we ſhall labor and trauaile, ſo alſo we are to take parte of our labors, it is our portion vnder the ſunne. But withall wee muſt obſerue, that when he ſaith, this is my portion of all my labor, he doeth ſpeake as of a ſmal thing, and not to be wayed or eſtéemed as the chéefe and principal matter which man is to ſéek. For it is as if he had ſaid, my labors are great, I haue no more for my portion but delight and pleaſure for the time.
               For when hee doeth well way what this portion is, he maketh it nothing. He had as much ioy and pleaſure as could be had in all earthly creatures: and doeth he ſay, Haue I no more for my portion but this? Doeth he make ſo light of the matter? There be multitudes, which if they could come but vnto the tenth part of his glorie, riches, and pleaſures, woulde not ſet ſo light by them. They would thinke their labours wel beſtowed, and take thē ſelues very happie men, if they might but ſwil themſelues in the dregs of thoſe pleaſures which he did ſwim in. If ſome

man had but one of his goodly houſes, it would cauſe him to looke aloft.
               It ſheweth that this noble king had a farre better ſight, to diſcerne and iudge of theſe earthly thinges, then men commonly haue. For the world is blinde, and countes it gaine to liue deliciouſly for a ſeaſon. He ſaith in the next words, I looked vnto all my works which my hands had done, and vnto the labour which I had trauailed for to doe, and behold, all is vanitie, and vexation of ſpirite, and there is no profite vnder the ſunne.
               
               Then we ſée, his portion was not ſuch, but that all ſtil was vanitie. A worthie thing to be conſidered of all men, that hée could enioy to the ful the good which is to be found in all things vnder heauen, and yet ſée ſo cléer that all is vanitie, and veration of ſpirite, and no profite at all. For he dooth now ſpeake of ſome profit which remayneth. Then we might ſée by him, that if we had our portion in all the beſt things vnder the ſunne, yet it ſhall not make vs one iotte the néerer vnto happines: yet fooliſh people wilſay, he hath all

things at will, he is happie.
               Let vs here make compariſon. The great magnificall workes of king Solomon, with all his royaltie, and glory, and pleaſures, are vanitie, and vexation of ſpirite. What is then to be thought of the workes of meaner perſons, yea, let it bée euen of kings? Their works are not comparable vnto his. All his haue vaniſhed, and ſhall not theirs? He founde no good, and ſhall they finde any? Behold then, a man ſet vp in the height and toppe of all excellencie for this world, who alſo hauing made ſearch euery way to the full, to finde good, doeth proclaime, and cry out aloud vnto all other whom he beholdeth from aloft, ſtriuing below, and labouring themſelues euen out of breath, to clime vp vnto him, that they doe but loſe their labour, and wearie themſelues in vaine. For when they haue gotten euen to the higheſt degrée of wealth, of dignitie, and pleaſures, they ſhall finde naught but méere vanitie. There is no credite geuen vnto this, which ſheweth, that the worldlings are too too ſhamefully beſotted

and be witched, for they labour as earneſtly to clime aloft in the worlde, as if the fulnes of ioy and felicitie were therby to be attained. They haue nothing the like care to ſéeke the kingdome of God, where in déed alone is the true bleſſednes. They ſpill both bodie and ſoule, to come by that which can doe them no good at all. They builde their houſes in bloud, in craft and deceite, with briberie, extortion, yea with all maner of vniuſt dealing, haue they increaſed their riches.
               If they coulde riſe vp as lawfully as Solomon, it were much néerer, yet all vanitie. What is their miſerie then, which they haue doubled by their wicked couetouſnes, and ambition? If they looke to goe beyonde Solomon, they be madde▪ If they looke to be equall with him, they be fooles, they ſhall neuer come nigh him by many degrées. If they thinke to find good, then it muſt be in the ſcraps, whereas he could neuer finde, but denieth it to be in the full furniture of the table.
               This might ſtay our courſe when we

runne ſo gréedily and ambiciouſly after the world. If we had the grace and wiſdome but to be thinke vs, that we are told by one which hath proued that all is but labour loſt. We run frō God whom we ſhould ſéeke and ſtay vpon: and follow after that which can not helpe vs at all. We leane vpon a broken ſtaffe and ſtay vpon a réed. If God giue vs riches and honor, vſe them to his glorie, account of them as things tranſitorie. We muſt ſet our hearts vpon better things. If I could be equall with Solomon in glorie and royaltie, I perceiue by him it were nought worth. Why ſhould I depriue my ſelf of ye ioies of heauen, by a likerouſnes of that which is vtterly vaine? I can not ſerue God and Mammon. I can not delight in this world, and delight in God alſo. He that doth but deſire to be rich falleth into many noyſome luſtes, which drowne men in deſtructiō and perdition.1. Tim. 6. I will firſt, as I am commaunded, ſéeke the kingdome of God, and his righteouſneſſe. I will not labour for ye meat which periſheth, but for the meate which indureth

vnto eternall life. Vnto this I ſay we be admoniſhed.
               Then to conclude this point, I wiſh that kings, princes, nobles, rich men, and all other would take the vew of Solomons workes: his ſtately palaces, his pleaſant gardens, and orchyards, his gold and ſiluer, with al his honors &amp; delights: and with all marke wel and beléeue that he ſaith, all is vanitie and vexation of ſpirite, there is no profit vnder the ſun. This would doo them much good: they ſhould not be drowned and ſwalowed vp in earthly cares and pleaſures. Now he cōmeth to the other part. I turned (ſaith he) to behold wiſdome, and madneſſe, and follie. It may be demaunded, did he not behold wiſdome before, comparing her with madneſſe and follie, why doeth he then now turne to behold her againe? He did behold wiſdome before, and did ſearch her out by her ſelfe, &amp; found much indignation and ſorrow. Now he doeth behold what commoditie he receiued by her beyng mixed with delights, ſhe guiding his hart, through pleaſures. And becauſe

he ſpeaketh of euery thing ſo reſolutely, before he doo procéede any further, he preuenteth an obiection, for it might be ſaid, who is Solomon that we ſhould ſtand to his ſentence, is his experience ſo perfect aboue all others?
               To this he maketh anſwere, what ſhall the man doo which ſhall follow the king? that is, which will ſearch out matters which he hath ſearched. And he addeth, euen that which they haue doone alreadie. But the phraſe of the Hebrew tongue doth beare to ſay, euē that which is doone already. As if he ſhould ſay, let any man what ſoeuer he be vnder heauen, take vpon him to follow me, and to make triall in any one thing, he ſhall not go beyond me, he ſhal doo no more then I haue already doone. When he ſaith who is the man, it is to ſhewe that he is not to be found. All kings, princes, rich and wiſe men in the earth ioyning together can not match him. God made him euen for the purpoſe, ſuch as hée neuer made any before nor after him.
               Then I ſaw (ſaith he) that there is

profit in wiſdome, more then in follie: as there is profit in light more then in darkneſſe. The wiſe mans eyes are in his head, but the foole walketh in the darke. He ſhewed before that to take delight in his trauaile (his hart beyng guided in wiſdome) had ſome commoditie in it, but yet all vanitie, it was but his portion for the preſent time. So now he declareth that he did alſo find profit in wiſdome being thus tempered, neuertheleſſe all is but vanitie, as he ſheweth by reaſons.
               But firſt ſée, how he doth lay open the commoditie of wiſdome aboue follie, by a compariſon. It is ſo much more beneficiall and good, as the light is aboue the darkeneſſe: compare then theſe two, the light and the darkneſſe, and ye haue the difference of the other. It is not in euery mans power to match wiſdome and follie together, for how ſhall men iudge of that which they know not, nor neuer ſaw? they are acquainted with follie, but wiſdome is hid from them. For this cauſe he giueth a rule which is common. All men can tell what profit there is in light

aboue darkneſſe. And hee ſheweth that thereby wee may take a iuſt meaſure what profit there is in wiſdome more then in follie, when he ſaith it is as in the light aboue the darkeneſſe, Well then let vs hold vs to the rule, which he giueth to take the true meaſure and to ſcanne this matter withall: becauſe there is no man that poſſeſſeth wiſdome: but ſome hath one péece, and ſome an other more then the common ſort.
               But we inioy the light and are depriued thereof eftſoones by the darke: this is common to the foole and to the wiſe. He that walketh in the light doth not ſtumble, for it ſheweth him his way. He that goeth in the darke knoweth not whether he goeth, he ſteppeth into the ditch. The light is comfortable, and ſheweth vnto a man many chéerefull and delightſome things. Darkeneſſe is dolefull and vncomfortable, couering the bewtie of all goodly things, when a man is in the middeſt of them. By the light men ſée to order their worke and doo it well: In the darke they cā doo nothing but marre that

they take in hand.
               We ſée that the eyes are ye light of the bodie, they be placed aboue in the head as in a watch to wer, and ſo behold round about and a farre of. If there be any good to be gotten they ſhew where the way lieth toward it. If any daunger approch, they tell how to ſhunne and auoid the ſame. To this he cōpareth the wiſdome of the wiſe, whē he ſaith, the wiſe mans eyes are in his head, but he likeneth a foole to a blind man: the foole (ſaith he) doth walke in darkneſſe. Then we may ſée his minde is this, a wiſe man touching ye matters of this world (for he ſpeaketh here but of the worldly wiſdome, which can ſée no iotte beyond worldly affaires) hath his ſkill and knowledge for a light, euen, as ye eies be in a mans head.
               The benefit hereof is ſuch, that it ordreth all his waies. He doth eſchew dangers, miſchiefs, inconueniences, and euery hurtfull thing. He procureth cōmodities on all ſides. He hath delight &amp; pleaſure in the worke of his hands. The foole is blind, &amp; if he haue not one which hath

eies to lead him, falleth into the ditch on euery ſide: he daſheth his head againſt euery poſt: he wrappeth himſelfe among buſhes and briers, and is rent and torne: If he ſtruggle out, he is neuer the néere, becauſe he is by and by in new dangers. Thus we may ſée what is the proſite of wiſdome aboue follie. Let vs note here then firſt, that Solomon doeth not condemne humane wiſdome, but commendeth it as a thing profitable, when it is rightly vſed, as conteyning it ſelfe within the compaſſe of worldly matters. For when ſhe medleth with heauenly &amp; ſpirituall thinges, ſhe is aboue her reach, ſhée doth ſteppe out of her owne ſhop: though ſhe be as a cléere eye for this preſent world, yet for heauenly things ſhée is ſtarke blinde, and a very madde bedlem, condemning the wiſdome of God &amp; ſpirituall1. Cor. 2. myſteries to be follie, becauſe they agrée not with her.
               Let vs alſo marke in this place, that it is little maruaile, though the wiſe men of this world make wonderfull account of their wiſdome: they take pleaſure in

the commodities which they reape thereby. They laugh ſlilie to ſée others in the briers and plagued through their follie. But this is aboue their ſkill, and herein they erre, that when a man for to kéepe a good cōſcience▪ falleth into dāgers &amp; miſeries in this world, they iudge him a foole. Al their wiſdom is to kéep this world, the loſſe of it they eſtéem madnes. It is far of frō the wiſdome of fleſh &amp; bloud to teach a mā to deny himſelf, to renounce ye world, and to take vp his croſſe. And this is the only way vnto true bleſſedneſſe.
               For the ſonne of God ſaid, that ſuch as will be his diſciples, muſt doo that. Math.
                  Math. 16. 
                  16. The great wiſe men of this world, whoſe wiſdome doeth abound and ouerflow, euen as the waters in the ſea, delighting in the excellencie of things preſent, doo together with the fooliſh, hate and perſecute extremely Chriſtes true diſciples. For the wiſdome of the fleſh is enmitie againſt God: Becauſe it is not ſubiect vnto the law of God, neither in déede can be. Rom. 8. God doth deſtroy the wiſdomeRom. 8. of this world. 1. Cor. 1. He hath giuen1. Cor. 1.
                  
Chriſt to be our wiſdom: and in him are all the treaſures of wiſdome &amp; knowledge. Col. 1. His doctrine deſtroleth thatCol. 1. wherin the wiſe doo moſt glory, and therfore they doo account it moſt abſurd. Few ſuch wiſe men are called to be partakers of Gods glory. 1. Cor. 1. they follow the1. Cor. 1. world, they heape vp riches, they ſéeke countenance and glorie.
               Moreouer, we muſt beware that wée doo not miſunderſtand Solomon in this place, when he doth ſpeake of wiſdome, comparing her to the light, &amp; to the eies in the head. We may not iudge that hée doth ſpeake this of craft and ſubtiltie, but of ſuch knowledge as is good in▪ it ſelfe, and in the right vſe doth bring commoditie: now a daies, though there-be fewe wiſe men (for it is attained with great &amp; long trauaile) yet there be many that thinke themſelues wiſe, and are offended if men doo not ſo déeme them. When as in déede the greateſt part of their wiſdome, doth reſt in a naughtie diſſembling craftines and falſhood. They haue no ſkil in good ſciences, and yet becauſe they can

with ſubtill ſhiftes and very couſening tricks ouer reach other, they glory much, and take themſelues to be the onely politikes of the world. Theſe men are none of thoſe of whom he ſpeaketh, when he ſaith, the wiſe mans eyes are in his head, this kind of ſkill is gotten without ſore trauaile and ſorrow. It is an eaſie thing for mans corrupt nature to put in practiſe this diueliſh art: who can not faine, lie, and diſſemble?
               Wel, theſe are to be put out of the nū
                  ber, and ſent among the fooles, leaſt they might glorie, and ſay, we be the men of whom Solomon doeth ſpeake: We haue our eyes in our head. No, no, your ſubtle wilines is oftentimes a ſnare or a nette, a pit, or a trap to catch your ſelues. Hée catcheth the wiſe in their craftineſſe. 1.
                  1. Cor. 4. 
                  Cor. 4.
               
               Moreouer, we may learn this in cōtinuall experience, that a mā whoſe policy is craft, is ſuſpected in all his doings, and thought to diſſemble, euen when he meaneth ſimplie, and without fraud. Away then all diſſembling and falſe, not wiſe

men, but fooles, Ye wil replie, that there is ſuch déepe craft and diſſimulation now practiſed in the world, that (vnles a man doe méete with it with the like) he ſhall neuer goe through. For ſome are not aſhamed to ſay, that he which will liue in theſe dayes, muſt diſſemble, and vſe craft For priuate affaires, and for publike buſines in gouernment of commonwelths, if a man do not vſe craft, if he do not fain and diſſemble, he ſhalbe made a foole, hée muſt ſtudie with ſubtiltie to repell ſubtiltie, and ſo faſhion himſelfe to the manners of the world.
               Alas, is wiſdome become ſo weake, that ſhe cannot defende her ſelfe againſt falſhode? Certainly, there is no falſe packing in the worlde, but wiſdome is able both to eſpie it, and to incounter it. Make a difference therefore (my brethren) béetwixt theſe ſortes of men. Count not the wiſdome of this world to be fraude and guile. No; it is ſimple and plaine, the other is but the abuſe thereof.
               Thus farre haue we ſéene what Solomon found in pleaſures and wiſdom ioined

together, and in all his royall &amp; magnificall workes, which ſerued for honour and delight. There doe remaine the reaſons which he bringeth to proue that not notwithſtanding the good that enſueth frō either, yet all is vanitie in both. I will not now deale with them, but if it pleaſe God, the next time.
               Lay vp I pray you (brethren) in your hearts, his doctrine here vttered. Meditate alone by your ſelues vpon his glory▪ riches, and delights. Conſider his great workes, and his wiſdom, and remember wel what he found in them all. Be not ſo vnwiſe, as to imagine ye can goe béeyonde him, yea or to come any thing ni

                     16 For there ſhalbe no remembrance of the wiſe, and of the foole for euer: for in the dayes that ſhall come, all that is now ſhalbe forgotten, and how dieth the wiſe with the foole.
                     17 Therfore I hated life, becauſe the worke which is wrought vnder the Sun, ſeemed euill vnto me▪ for all is vanitie, and vexation of ſpirite.
                     
                        18 I hated alſo my labour, in which I laboured vnder the ſunne: for I ſhall leaue it to the man that ſhall bee after me.
                     19 And who knoweth whether hee ſhalbe wiſe, or a foole, and yet ſhall hee rule ouer all my labour, wherein I haue laboured, and wherin I haue ſhewed my ſelfe wiſe vnder the ſunne, this alſo is vanitie.
                     20 Therfore I turned away, to make my heart to be without hope, concerning all the labour wherein I haue trauailed vnder the ſunne.
                     21 For there is a man whoſe labour is in wiſdome, and in knowledge, an equitie: and to a man that hath not laboured therein muſt he geue his portion, this alſo is vanitie▪ and a great e

that he eate and drinke, and delight his ſoule with the profite of his labour. I ſaw alſo this, that this is of the hande of God.
                     25 For who coulde eate, and who could haſt vnto outwarde thinges more than I?
                     26 For, to a man that is good in his ſight, God geueth wiſdom, knowledge, and ioy: but to the ſinner hee geueth paine, to gather, and to heape vp, and to geue to him which is good before God. This alſo is vanitie, and vexation of ſpirite.
                  
               
               Eccleſiaſies. Chap. 2.
               
                  
                     I Know alſo, &amp;c. In the former part of this Chapter, wée haue ſéene how hee ſearched for good in pleaſures and wiſdome mixed together,

and in all excellent and magnificall workes, which ſerued for either of them. We haue alſo heard what profit he found this way.
               Now commeth he to ſhew by reaſons why yet all is vanitie, and firſt for wiſdome. It hath profite in it aboue follie, as much as the light hath aboue darkeneſſe: but yet there remayneth no good by it. For the light of the ſunne which we doe now enioy, doeth ſerue but for the preſent vſe. For when death commeth, and the eyes be cloaſed vp, what good remayneth, can it make a man happie? Euen ſo is it with humane wiſdome, it doeth a man much good for a little time: but afterward, as the blind man, and he which hath his eyes, are made alike: ſo the wiſe and the fool méete together, and are made equall in one condition. For that reaſon he bringeth, I knowe alſo (ſaith he) that one condition befalleth to them all. If all the wiſdome vnder the ſunne can aduaunce the poſſeſſor thereof no more, but that he muſt méete in the ſelfe ſame condition with the foole, yea euen with the

moſt dullarde which liueth, what profite doeth remaine?
               Sée I pray you, how hee reaſoned in himſelfe about this poynt, I ſaide in my heart, it befalleth to me as it befalleth to the foole, why then doe I labour to bee more wiſe? I ſaid in my heart, that this alſo is vanitie. What a goodly gifte was this: yea, what a grace of god in him, that he could in his mind haue this conſideration: it came not from the wiſdom of fleſh and bloud, for that doeth blinde men, and puffe them vp in a vaine opinion. They imagine themſelues to be petie Gods in compariſon of the ſimple meane people. It doeth not enter into them to ſay in their heart, what good ſhall all my wiſdome doe me? The fool ſhalbe in the ſame condition, the ſame ſhall befall vnto mée, which befalleth vnto him. Shal I glory in that which cannot exalt me one ſteppe aboue the pooreſt, the ſimpleſt, and vileſt foole?
               To what end ſhould Ilabour ſo much to abound in wiſdome? It is méere vanitie, ſéeing no good commeth thereby. It is

the beſt way for me to ſéek for that which will ſtick by me, and aduaunce me vnto glorie perpetuall. This wiſdome periſheth, and all the glorie of it doeth vaniſh in a moment. I ſay, if men had the grace to reaſon thus with Solomon, it were a goodly matter. Some wil replie here, and ſay, that the wiſe mā leaueth a fame behind him, and is renowmed for euer, and therein his condition is not all one with the foole. True it is in déede, that many wiſe men leaue a fame behind them, and ſome fewe leaue in record ſuch teſtimonie of their ſkill, that their praiſe continueth.
               But alas it is ſo poore a remembrāce, and ſo vaine a thing, that he ſaith, there is no remembrance of the wiſe, and of the foole for euer: in the daies that ſhal come all that is now ſhall be forgotten. Thus we ſée the wiſe man and the foole wrapped vnder one couerlet, ouer whelmed in obliuion. Solomon beholding this in his mind, louing and fauoring wiſdome, being himſelfe very wiſe, and deſpiſing follie, he crieth out with great diſdaine, and

ſaith, how dieth the wiſe with the foole? Whatſoeuer aduantage he hath in his life time, at his death he is made euen with the foole.
               It may be obiected, that if this be a ſufficient reaſon to prooue that wiſdome is vanitie, becauſe the wiſe dieth as the foole: then the ſame reaſon may hold againſt the true, heauenly, and ſpirituall wiſdom. For the true knowledge of God, and his feare doo not ſo priueledge any mā, but that he dieth as others doo. What hath the godly man at his death more thē the wicked? I anſwere, that here is the difference: the wiſe man for this world hath had all that he can haue by his wiſdome. It for ſaketh him when death commeth. There remaine no matters in the world that is to come, wherein he may imploy his ſkill, or haue any vſe of his knowledge. Thus doth his wiſdome vaniſh and come to an end at his death.
               On the contrarie, then beginneth the fruit &amp; commoditie of the heauenly wiſdome when a man dieth. For the knowledge of God which is here but in part,

ſhall be perfected in the life to come, and ſhall neuer vaniſh. That man ſhall reap endleſſe fruit by his wiſdome. Out wardly, for his departure from this world, he differeth not from the foole, but with God there is a great difference. Hauing told vs how he reaſoned in himſelfe about the wiſe man &amp; the foole, thus by death made equall, now hée vttereth what effect it wrought in him. I hated life (ſaith he) becauſe the worke that is done vnder the funne ſeemed euill vnto me.
               
               By this manner of ſpéech, he declareth a wonderful miſliking which he had conceiued in his minde of the ſtate of this preſent life: partly for that the wiſe and the foole end a like, and it befalleth to the one, as it befalleth to the other, and they doo méete together in an equall condition, and partly for that which followeth in this chapter. He taketh ſuch diſpleaſure, that it ſhould be all one with the foole as with him, that he is wearie of his life, yea he hateth this life. For all the worke that is wrought vnder the ſunne, ſéemed euill vnto him, becauſe al is vanitie, and veration

of the ſpirit. A notable place to teach vs whence it commeth that men can ſo well away with this preſent life.
               If they were not fooles and blinde, if they had wiſdome to diſcuſſe, as he deeth here, though they had all his glory and riches, they ſhould abhorre this life and be diſcontented with it. Such as be in trouble and vexation, preſſed with pouertie and other grieuances can be content to depart: but how grieuous is the remembrance of death vnto ſuch as haue aboundance and liue in pleaſures? If they be wiſe in this their loue of preſent life, if they be right, Solomon was a foole, &amp; went wrong out of the way, for he is of a contrarie minde. He ſaw the vanitie of this life to be ſuch, that he hated life.
               It may be demaunded whether he did well in this, that he ſaith he hated life: for life in it ſelfe is a precious thing, it is Gods gift, for which we are to giue him great thankes: and how ſhould he ſay he hated life? We muſt not take it that hée hated life it ſelfe, but the things which are annexed vnto it: as vanitie, vexation

of ſpirite and miſerie. Theſe are inſeperably annexed vnto this preſent life, and therfore he nameth the life it ſelfe, which he can not inioy without theſe. Our Saviour ſaith likewiſe Iohn. 12. he that louethIoh. 12. his life in this world ſhall looſe it, and he that hateth his life, ſhall kéepe it vnto eternal life. Tuſh wil ſome thinke, Solomon was ouer wiſe, his wiſdome made him full of moroſitie, it did hinder him.
               If I had but the one halfe, or a quarter, yea the hundreth part of that which he had, I would liue merily, I would I might liue vntil I hated my life, or were wearie of it. To ſuch men I ſay, if he were ouer wiſe, they come as far ſhort. He had not ſo much, but they haue as litle. It were well for theſe Epicures, if they had ſome hundreth part of his wiſdome, with the like portiō of thoſe things which he poſſeſſed: which becauſe they want, they are like vnto the oxe which is fed in ſwéete paſture, he is wanton &amp; kicketh vp his héeles, there is no thought of the butchers ax. Theſe looke for no iudgement

to come. Set this before your eyes, labour not to finde a pleaſant life here: But rather learne of this king in ye middeſt of all aboundance to meditate, to ſearch out the vanitie of all theſe things, and ſo to draw our harts from them. Before this preſent eſtate doo miſtike vs, we can not ſigh &amp; grone for a better. Which thoſe do that haue receiued the firſt fruits of the ſpirite, as wee are taught Rom. 8.
                  Rom. 8. Let not deceiuéable things blind our eies Whoſoeuer he be that doeth not miſtike this preſent eſtate, yea hate life, in compariſon of eternall life, he ſhall neuer taſt of the ioyes of heauen.
               Thus he hath concluded touching wiſdome. Now he commeth vnto thoſe his great workes, which ſerued for honour &amp; pleaſure. He had his portion in them for the time: but he doth ſhewe by reaſons that there was nothing in them but fore and extreme vanitie: theſe be his words. I hated alſo all my labour in which I labour vnder the ſunne. As he hated life, ſo he hated all his labour, and why? becauſe he muſt leaue it vnto an other man.
               
                  It may ſéeme that in this he went too farre: for ſhould that grieue him: nature doth teach men to loue their childrē and poſteritie, and ſo to prouide for them as for their owne bowels. That maketh men trauaile ſo willingly to get poſſeſſions, which they may conuey vnto their children, and beyng done with equitie &amp; moderation is a thing very commendable. Is Solomon then become vnnaturall, that it grieueth him becauſe he hath laboured for his ſonne? For he ſaith, I hated all my labour, in which I laboured vnder the ſunne, becauſe I ſhall leaue it to the man that ſhall be after mée. Wée may not take it ſo. For doubtleſſe he had naturall affection &amp; loue to his children. But here is his griefe, and this is that which doth ſtick ſo nigh him, and cauſeth him to hate his labour, that hée can not tell whether the mā whom he ſhal make his heire and leaue all his workes vnto, will proue wiſe or a foole. He muſt haue all, though hée be a foole. He muſt rule ouer all his labours wherein he hath laboured and ſhewed wiſedome.
               
                  This is the vanitie. Here is the ſore and griefe. He ſhewed excéeding great wiſdome in all his workes, he delighted in wiſdome, he diſdained follie: and now can he not tell whether all his workes wrought in wiſdome, ſhall come into the hands of a foole. And in déed his ſonne Rehoboam did not proue very wiſe, when he forſooke the counſell of the old men, and followed the counſell of the yoong men. And when he forſoke the way of Dauid &amp; Solomon, (that is, the way of the Lord) and ſet vp Idolatrie, and falſe worſhip. 2. Chro. 11. It is a thing which2. Chr. 11. commeth vſually to paſſe among men: that the father is wiſe, and the ſonne a foole. But let it be that a man perceiueth his ſonne, (vnto whom he ſhall commit ouer all his good and poſſeſſions) is wiſe, yet he doth not know what his ſonne or his ſonnes ſonne ſhal be. For it doth fall but that certaine generations are wiſe in their worldly affaires, and doo increaſe their ſubſtance: &amp; after riſeth vp a foole, 
                     •
                  nd he doth ſcatter and waſt his patrimo
                  
                     •
                  ie. For we muſt not reſtrain his words

to the next heire, when he ſaith, I ſhall leaue it to the man that ſhall be after me: and who doth know whether he ſhall be wiſe, or a foole?
               Marke one thing then in this place. If thoſe works which are wrought wiſely, haue no certaintie in the heires which ſuccéede, but may come into the handes of a foole? and doo very often: what ſhall we ſay of thoſe houſes and landes which are gotten vniuſtly, and by hard dealing: as by couetouſnes, by extortion, by bryberie, by deceipt, and violence? He doeth not meane that ſuch men as come by their goods ſo naughtily, doo ſhe we themſelues wiſe in their laboures, for wiſdome is with vprightnes and truth. What meruaile is it then, though ſuch poſſeſſions do come to naught, for by the iuſt iudgement of God they come into ye hands of fooles? couetouſe ambitious fooles gat them, and prodigall riotous fooles doe ſpend them. Yea, but we ſée ſuch goods and poſſeſſions ſtand as firme (to mans thinking) as the earth, cōueied from heire to heire, for hundreths of yéeres in continuance.
               
                  It is ſo no doubt, but here is our weakeneſſe which can not ſée that fiue or ſixe hundreth yéeres is nothing. It is a litle prolonging of time, but it paſſeth as a ſhadow. Their houſes, their memoriall, and their glory periſheth. If we did liue but a thouſand yeares we ſhould ſée much cōcerning this point. We liue thrée ſcore and ten, and in this we ſée ſomewhat. For there be many whoſe workes we ſée are with fraud and bloud: and in the verie next heire are conſumed to naught in ſhort time,
               By this the Lord doth teach vs, what ſhal be the end of thoſe other, which ſéeme to ſtand as faſt as the mountaines, and to endure all ſtormes and tempeſtes which do ariſe? thus might we ſee what the inſatiable gréedineſſe of man commeth vnto. Man walketh (ſaith the Prophete in the Pſalme) in a ſhadow, he diſquieteth him ſelfe in vaine: he heapeth vp riches and can not tell who ſhall gather them, for oftentimes it falleth out that ye riches which he hath heaped vp, come not onely into the handes of a foole, but of a foole

which is not of his kindred.
               Shall we then ſo hate all labour as to giue it ouer, is that Solomons purpoſe? No, in no wiſe. It is not his meaning, that a man ſhould not trauaile for his poſteritie, becauſe his ſonne may proue a foole. But he would not haue men ſo to labour, and ſo to ſet their harts as vpon a matter of value. Labour in ſuch ſort as about that which is vaine and tranſitorie, ſeruing but for preſent neceſſitie. Iudge and eſtéeme theſe worldly things to bée moſt vaine and vncertaine: let them not hinder better things. Labour &amp; poſſeſſe, but yet as though ye poſſeſſed not. 1. Cor. 7. Labour becauſe God will haue yée to1. Cor. 7. eate bread in the ſweat of your browes. But yet ſée and know that all your laboures are ſubiect vnto vanitie. And ſo may yée come to that which hée ſaith, I hated all my labour. Set your delight and loue vpon the labour for the ſpirituall and true treaſure: lift vp your minds to ſéeke heauen and heauenly things.
               Wel, he goeth yet a ſtep further, and ſaith, Therefore I turned away, to make

my heart to be without hope, or to deſpaire, concerning all my trauaile vnder the ſunne: for ſo he ſpeaketh. This turning away, is the turning away of his minde, &amp; affection from his workes. For, to the ende he might ſearch duely, bee ſet his delight for a time vpon them. Now, to draw away the ſame more forciblie, he cauſeth his heart to deſpaire, or to haue no hope to receiue any good in all his ſore trauaile, wherein he trauailed vnder the ſunne.
               Here is an example for all wiſe men to follow, euen by déepe meditation, and a full inſight into thinges, to perſwade their hearts by ſound reaſons, that they may neuer hope for any good to remaine of their worldly trauails. For if men did this, they could not be ſo blinded with a vaine hope, and caried away, as if the cō
                  modities were incomparable which they ſhal reap by their labors. Men are blind herein by nature, and the deuil doth blinfolde them: he wil not let them ſée that which made Solomon turne away, and make his heart deſpaire of his laboures.

And to ſée what are other mens workes in compariſon of his. Hee doeth (as it were) fiſh in the maine ſea, and they in little ditches. If his nets come vp emty, how then?
               Touching this matter he hath hetherto ſpoken of himſelfe, now he doeth amplifie it by a kinde of compariſon. It is taken from the meaner ſort of men, there is none of them, but if he haue laboured in wiſdome, knowledge and equitie, but it may gréeue him, that he muſt leaue it to another man which hath not trauayled therein, for his portion. This he ſaith is vanitie, and a great euill. For by this it commeth to paſſe, that one man trauaileth, and another receiueth all the profite and commoditie. The father, to make his ſonne rich, ſo turmoyleth and pyneth himſelfe, that he hath no pleaſure of his life: the ſonne, when he is a father▪ doeth the like for his childe, and ſo euerie one defraudeth himſelfe. For he demandeth, what remaineth to a man of all his trauaile and gréefe of heart, wherin he hath trauailed vnder the ſunne. And marke

how hee ioyneth gréefe with mans trauayle. For he addeth in the next words, that all his daies are ſorrowes, and his trauaile greefe, his heart alſo reſteth not in the night.
               
               He doeth in few wordes paynt out a miſerable condition of ſuch as be worldlings, and gréedie of gaine. A couetous man hath tortures and ſorowes ſufficiēt in him. They cannot gather riches, and kéep them, but with ſorrowes and gréefs. Yea all times, &amp; continually, for he ſaith, all their daies are ſorowes. It agréeth with that which I alledged out of Saint Paul 1. Tim. 6. when he ſaith, that ye loue1. Tim. 6. of money is the roote of all euill: which while ſome haue luſted after, they haue erred from the faith, and pearced themſelues through with many ſorowes. But this which he addeth laſt, goeth beyonde all, that the heart doeth not lie downe, or reſt in the night. The night is made for reſt, when men haue on the day time trauailed and▪ wearied themſelues, the body cannot endure without reſt. Now when that is laid down, the heart or mind doth

not lie downe, but walketh about all the night long.
               It is the chéef part of man, but in this reſpect, in worſe caſe then the bodie, that it walketh al about, and taketh no reſt in the night. In the day time it is buſied, and ſetteth the body a worke: if the bodie could holde out, it would alſo, and neuer reſt: but it cannot, and therefore in the night the heart doeth wander, and folowe the buſines alone.
               Here is great inſtruction for couetous ambitious worldlings, if they might haue their eies opened: certainly they be ſtark foles which couet to be rich. If they were not blinde as ſtones, they muſt néedes féele that which he vttereth here, &amp; haue theſe thoughts in themſelues. I deſire, and I labour to gather riches, all my labours are full of gréefes and ſorowes. I haue ſuch hindrances and loſſes, &amp; méete with ſo many croſſe matters, that it vexeth and diſquieth my heart. I haue ſuch care to increaſe and kéepe that which I haue, that my hart reſteth not in ye night. I haue ſo many enemies, and that great

men, which lie in wayte to pluck me. I am to buy a péece of lande, for which I muſt diſburſe a great deale of money, if I loſe it, I am euen halfe vndone: If the title ſhould not be good, or if my euidēces ſhould be made vnſkilfullie, there is ſuch craftie dealing in the world, that I ſhalbe ſure to loſe it. This troubleth my minde day and night, I cannot ſléepe quietly, I labour all the day, euen while my bones ake. When night commeth I am afraide of théeues. For, my cattle, my corne, or my money lyeth in danger. My heart, when I lie in my bed, is either vpon my goods in the fields, or deuiſing where I may light vpon ſome good bargaine. I haue light vpon euil creditors, and crafty dealing felowes, I am afraide I ſhal neuer come by mine owne. But why doe I goe about to reckon vp all particulars, a man were almoſt as good take vpon him to number the ſtars. My ſorrowes and cares are infinite. I dreame of théeues, I am troubled in my ſléepe with this and that buſines. I perceiue that my hart neuer lieth downe, neuer taketh any reſt,

but when my bodie is a ſléepe, that walketh about. In the morning (my body being refreſhed) I am carried abroad again ſo long as I am able to indure. My ſorrowes doe laſt continuallie, and haue no ende, I am a night-walker, what ſhal I get? When I haue laboured, and heaped vp all that I can, another which hath not trauayled therein muſt haue my portion. I haue dealt wiſely to get riches, which I leaue behinde me in great plentie. It may be they ſhal come into the handes of a foole, which will ſcatter them abroade. What a wretched foole am I, thus to tormente and diſquiet my ſelfe in vaine? Gréefe, and care, and ſorrowes, &amp; toyle night and day, and no good remaine. I wiſh it from the very bottom of my hart, and I doe inſtantly begge it of God, that mens eyes might be opened, to ſée cléere in this poynt, &amp; that they would déepely meditate vpon this doctrine. For I doe not hope to ſée any great fruite of the goſpell, ſo long as men be ſo gréedie of this world. Ye ſhall ſée hote profeſſors of gods word, both of prechers and people, which

in fewe yeres ſetting their heartes vpon riches, become colde inough.
               Alas, it is not poſſible they ſhould cō
                  tinue vpright, vnleſſe we will imagine that the ſcripture is not true, which ſaith, Ye cannot ſerue God and riches.
               And here again geue me leaue to reaſon a little by cōpariſon. King Solomon hated life, hated all his workes, turned away his heart, to make it deſpaire of his trauaile, in the middeſt of riches and honor lawfullie gotten, crieth out that all is vanitie, ſorowes, and gréefes, and continuall vexation of minde, and no good remayneth. What ſhal we thinke then of ſuch as get their goods vnlawfully? Manie doe ſcrape, and catch on all ſides, ſo they may lay holde, they care not how, whether it be by violence or by fraude. Yea they pluck it euē
                  ▪ from the poore and néedie, from the fatherles &amp; from the widow, for ſuch wretched men there be many in theſe daies.
               Now, beſide all ſuch miſeries and ſorrowes as he hath ſpoken of, accurſed are ſuch riches, yea, the heauie curſe of God

hangeth ouer thoſe men, which clime to wealth and honour that way. For ſake it people, forſake it, &amp; deale vprightly euerie man with his neighbor. If ye haue either houſe or land yt commeth not rightlie, or any goods euill gotten, reſtore all to the true owners. Wilt thou appeare before thy iudge, or dareſt thou come into his preſence to holde vp giltie handes? Wilt thou damne thine owne ſoule for a little worldly wealth? For, how wilt thou eſcape damnatiō, if thou haſt hidden ſtolne gooddes among thy ſtuffe? If thou haſt not repented, how wilt thou be ſaued? If thou reſerue that which thou knoweſt to bee none of thine, how dooſt thou repent?
               At this I cānot but wonder, how men dare (when they die) make gifte to their children of euill gotten goods? I doe not maruaile to ſee men deceiue and defraude one another while they liue. The nature of man is ſo licouriſh of gaine, and the deuill leadeth men on in a forgetfulneſſe, that they ſhal euer be brought to make any reckoning. Againe, they be ſo afraide

that they ſhall want to ſerue their neceſſities before they die. But when they lie ſicke, and can ſée no remedie but death, knowing they muſt come to iudgement, and would faine be ſaued, and therefore doo crie for mercie: I ſaie it is verie ſtrange, that they will then depart, and carrie the ſtolen goods before the iudge, and damne their owne ſoules. For many a one doth remember euen at that time, this ſame houſe, or ſuch a péece of land is none of mine. My father gatte it, and held it vnlawfullie in my knowledge, it is ſuch a mans, if he had his right.
               I remember I did deceiue many, and oppreſſed them: I haue hindred them for to enrich my ſelfe. I haue taken vnlawfull gaine: I haue griped the poore that ſold for néed, I haue ſold them hard peniworthes. Well God haue mercie vpon mée, I will not reſtore it, I will giue it to mine heire. How horrible is the eſtate of theſe men? How wretched are they which grow great and féede vpon bryberie? it is beſt to kéepe thy hands vnſpotted from one penie of wrong gottē goods:

but if thou haſt dealt vniuſtly, repent, reſtore it, &amp; leaue it not behind thée among thy ſubſtance, when thou goeſt to iudgement. For the iudge will ſend to thy tent and fetch it, and lay it before thée: thou ſhalt be found guiltie, and not able to anſwere. Thus I conclude then, there is no good remaineth to a man of al his works wherein he hath dealt wiſely &amp; vprightly, though his goods ſo gotten be manie &amp; his honour great, yet after al his ſorrowfull daies he muſt forgoe all, an other muſt haue that which he hath trauailed in: thoſe goods and honours euill gotten are much worſe.
               Vpon occaſion of theſe former reaſons he doth repeat againe, what is all the good which a man can haue of his laboures: that is to eat and drinke, and to delight his ſoule with the profit of al his labour. He ſaith before in this chapter, that hée withheld his heart from no ioy, and that was his portion of all his labour. He had nothing elſe. And now he telleth that it is al, which any man can haue by his trauaile. For by eating and drinking, and

delighting his ſoule, he meaneth all the vſe of mans works, and of his riches. Let a man take part of them while he liueth, and vſe them in ſuch ſort, as that his ſorrowes and dexations may be mitigated. We may not take it that he ſtirreth men vp here vnto exceſſe, vnto gluttonie and drunkenneſſe, or to become belligods and Epicures. Neither is it his mind to ſhew here what the fleſh iudgeth: for the next words doo ſhew that he ſpeaketh of a good thing. For elſe how ſhould it be ſaid, I law that this is of the hand of God? it is Gods gift vnto a man, when he can eat and drinke, and delight his ſoule with the good of his trauaile.
               Yee haue ſéene before how he condemned eating and drinking, and pleaſures, when a man doth power forth him ſelfe vnto thē riotouſly: they make men mad, &amp; to become beaſts. But God hath made &amp; ordeined many things not only to ſerue neceſſitie, but alſo for pleaſure &amp; delight of his children, which they be to vſe moderately and wiſely. They differ much from the carnal man. For he doth delight

his ſoule in eating and drinking, forgetting God, and drowned in theſe things. But they ſolace▪ themſelues ſo in theſe thinges, that their hartes delight is not drawen from God. For they beholde his bleſſing, fauour and good will in the creatures of which they take their part: And this in déed is of the hand of God. The delight which the Epicure hath in filling his belly, is nothing beyng cōpared with this. It is but as the beaſts doo. God muſt be our delight, we may not delight in the creatures further then thus, that he hath giuen them vs as our portion here. Wée reioyce in the Lord, when wée reioyce in them ſo.
               The other ſort are far from this. For they doo delight themſelues, and imagine that they take their part, as Solomon ſaith, but if the remēbrance of God come in the way, all is marred: their pleaſure is in vanities and ſinnes. Do but ſpeake of death, of the day of iudgement, or of Gods diſpleaſure againſt ſinners, &amp; they take it euill, and be angrie. They ſay it is no time nor place to ſpeak of ſuch matters,

they came to be merie. Kuffians and riotous beaſts ſolace themſelues and are merie, but yet it cōmeth not nigh this gift of God. This is in no mans power, but where the giuer doth beſtow it.
               Some man hath great plentie, and doeth grudge at his owne bellie, this man is miſerable couetous, if clay would nouriſh him, he would eate it to ſpare his ſubſtance: yea, he would eat worſe for need.
               Another hath aboundance, and ſaith to his ſoul, eate, drinke, and be merrie, thou haſt goods inough laide vp for many yeres. Why doeth not this man right? He is couetous, and ſtayeth vpon the riches, he delighteth in them. Read the 12. Chapter of S. Luke, and there ye ſhall ſée how our Souiour ſetteth him out, pulling downe his barnes, &amp; building greater.
               This then is Gods gift, with peace of conſcience with ioy in God, for a man to take his part, and to delight himſelfe in his labours. This is not in euery man which hath riches. For if a man ſtay vpon them, their torment is neuer ended,

they can neuer be ſatiſfied. For, when he hath all, his ſtay is doubtfull and therfore he ſéeketh to heap vp ſtill, ſuppoſing that in greater aboundance he ſhall quiet his minde. O ſaith one, if I had but two hū
                  dreth pounds of good land, by the yeare, I would be fully contented. It falleth out that hee hath two &amp; two, and as his goods are increaſed, ſo is his minde more grupple. He is leſſe ſatiſfied then, when he was poore. Let vs ſtay vpon God, and vſe that he geueth with a chereful mind. The worldlings doe reioyce, but it is a madde ioy: for there be ſtinges within in their conſcience, which doe marre their mirth. Euen in laughter the heart is ſorowfull, and the end of that mirth is heauines,Prou. 14. 
                  Pro. 14.
               
               It may be ſaid, how coulde Solomon tell this? he might know his own heart, but coulde hée iudge of other men? To this he maketh anſwere: Who could eat, and who could haſt vnto outward things more then I? As if he ſhould ſay, I know there is no man vnder heauen, which can of him ſelfe, or by any gifte of nature

that is in him▪ eate and drink, and delight his heart in his labour, for if any man were able, it was my ſelfe: but I coulde not, therefore I am ſure no other coulde, vnleſſe it were geuen him of God, euē by a worke of grace. I was rich, I was in honor, I had wiſdome aboue all other, I had as little to care for as any, and yet could not I doe this without a ſpeciall gift and grace of God.
               The next verſe doeth more cléerly lay open this matter, by expreſſing the cauſe on both ſides. For (ſaith he) to the man that is good in his ſight, God geueth wiſdome, knowledge, and ioy: but to the ſinner he geueth paine, to gather &amp; to heape vp, to geue to him that is good before God. The Lord is gratious and bountifull vnto whome it pleaſeth him. The man that findeth fauour in his ſight, or vpon whom he ſetteth his heart, he receiueth from him all bleſſings. For vnto him he geueth wiſdome, and knowledge, and ioy.
               He ſpeaketh not here of the worldlie wiſdom and knowledge, of which he ſaid

before, in the multitude of wiſdome is much indignation, and he that increaſeth knowledge, increaſeth ſorrow. For we ſee, that the wiſdome and knowledge whereof he ſpeaketh here, haue ioy accompanying them. This is the knowledge of holy things, the feare of God, the truſt, &amp; delight in him. From hence dooth ſpring the cōtempt of this preſent world, the treading downe of immoderate cares and ſorowes about it, and the frée vſe with ioy and gladnes of all Gods benefites. This is it of which it is ſaid in the Pſalme, It is in vaine to riſe vp early, &amp; late to take reſt, eating the bread of ſorrowes, he doeth ſurely geue his beloued ſleepe. There he calleth it ſléepe, and here he doeth call it ioy. For he ſpeaketh not of that ſléepe of the bodie, ſo much as of ye quietnes of minde which the godly man enioyeth, whether he be rich or poore.
               Let vs obſerue further, that it is not onely Gods gift, to vſe the things of this world aright, with ſound comfort, but alſo a ſpeciall gift of wiſdome and true vnderſtanding, wherby the man is directed.
               
                  As this is Gods mercie to the good, ſo the contrarie, that is, to be a drudge in the world, to be vexed, moleſted and formented with cares, to eate the bread of ſorrowes, for to heape vp, and increaſe riches, is a puniſhment and iudgement of God vpon wicked men. For he ſaith, that God geueth torment or paine to the ſinner, to gather and to heape vp. And as the other is wiſdome, ſo this is follie. The good man (through the true knowledge of God) deſpiſeth the world: the worldlie man is blinded with follie, and tormenteth himſelfe for the world.
               It is true that a penaltie is layd vpon all Adams children, that with the ſweat of their browes they ſhall eat bread: but the bleſſing of God doeth aſſwage the gréeuouſneſſe thereof, vnto the faithfull. His curſe (as wee may gather by this place) doeth double it vpon the wicked. For when it is ſaide, God geueth him paine, it muſt néedes be more than common.
               A very notable place to be conſidered of all men: to teach them whence all moleſtations

doe ſpring, for the mainteining of this preſent life. We ſée many haue a ſore burthen vpon them, and are troubled in ſuch wiſe to get their liuing, that they be euen wearie of life. They put to all the trauell of their bodies, and ſtudie and deuiſes of their minds, to winde out, but all will not ſerue. They grudge &amp; murmure, they catch on euery ſide what they can lay hold of, they deale deceitfully, they vſe couſenage, but neuer the néere. What doo they ſay at the laſt? this is an harde world: they haue not the wiſdome to ſée that God doeth accurſe them. And why? Becauſe they be wicked ſinners.
               Others there be which know no end of their goods, and of thoſe Solomon doth here particularly ſpeake, which yet notwithſtanding are neuer ſatiſfied: they haue ſo much care to gather and ſtill to heape vp, that they defraud their owne ſoules of good, they doo not inioy that which they haue. The world is full of theſe: a man that looketh vpon thē would thinke them iolly fellowes: they can not doo amiſſe, they haue plentie. Aſke how

doth ſuch a man: anſwere is made, hée can not but doe well, hée doth liue at his hearts eaſe: hée may diſpend fiue hundreth pounds by the yeare. When as neuertheleſſe his heart is in little eaſe: for cares doe pinch him: he doeth ſtill turmoile him ſelfe for to heape vp more: he doeth rob his owne bellie: he doth grudge to laie out any thing vpon himſelfe: becauſe he is looth to diminiſh his ſubſtance.
               This puniſhment (which he in blindneſſe can not perceiue) hath God laied vpon him. For he is worthie to be thus puniſhed, beyng one which hath let goe the feare of the Lord. Thus we ſée that the righteous iudge doth puniſh the contempt of his lawes, both in this world and in that which is to come. Now the vexation and trouble both of bodie and minde, which men doe ſuſteine: in the world to come, the euerlaſting paines of hell. It is not againſt this doctrine, which is ſaid to the rich glutton in hell, thou receiuedſt good in thy life, &amp; Lazarus paine, and now contrariwiſe hée is comforted, and thou art tormented. For this rich mā
                  
which was ſo daintily kept, both for his apparell &amp; diet, thought he receiued good (when it was no more but ſuch pleaſure as brute beaſts inioy) which he had in all his aboundance: and wanting faith to reſt vpō God, he was not without his cares: for riotous men, and delicate Epicures, be very couetous and gréedie of gaine: for if they had a ſea of wealth, they are in doubt it will be dried vp.
               How happie are thoſe which find fauour in Gods ſight, which haue a portion in this life, and afterward inherite eternall glory. This is it which Saint Paule ſaith, godlineſſe is great riches, which of it ſelfe doeth being contentation, and is fully ſufficient: for it hath the promiſes of this life and the life to come. There is an other thing which hée ſaith is a vanitie, which God alſo doeth lay vpon the wicked: that they with vexation doo trauell to gather riches (not for themſelues) but to giue vnto the righteous. They haue laboured, but full little doo they know vnto whom the fruite of their labour ſhall come. The Aſſe doeth carrie

great waight of treaſure vpon his backe, but not for him ſelfe, or vnto any vſe of his owne, but for his maiſter. Euen ſo theſe doe grone, and are burthened, and carrie the waight vntill they bring it where God will beſtow the ſame. Thus he hath laid open what mē find in worldly poſſeſſions. Let vs carefully remember his doctrine.

                        TO all thinges there is an appointed time, and a time to euery purpoſe vnder the heauen.
                     2 A time to be born, a time to die: a time to plant, and a time to pluck vp that which is planted.
                     3 A time to ſlay, a time to heale: a time to breake downe, and a time to builde.
                     4 A time to weepe, a time to laugh: a time to mourne, and a time to dance.
                     5 A time to caſt away ſtones, and a time to gather ſtones: a time to imbrace, and a time to be farre from imbraſing.
                     6 A time to finde, a time to loſe: a

time to keepe, and a time to caſt away.
                     7 A time to rent, a time to ſewe: a time to keepe ſilence, and a time to ſpeake.
                     8 A time to loue, and a time to hate: a time of warre, and a time of peace.
                     9 What profite hath hee that woorketh, of the thing wherein hee trauayleth?
                     10 I haue ſeen the trauaile that God hath geuen to the ſonnes of men, to occupie them therein.
                     11 He hath made euery thing bewtifull in his time: alſo he hath ſette the world in their heart, (except that which man cannot finde out,) euen the worke which God worketh from the beginning to the end.
                     12 I know there is nothing good in them, but to reioyce, and to doe good in his life.
                     13 And alſo that euery man eat and drinke, and ſee the commoditie of al his labour: this is the gift of God.
                     14 I knowe that what ſoeuer God ſhall doe, it ſhall be for euer, to it can no

man adde, and from it can no man diminiſh: for God hath done it that they ſhould feare before him.
                     15 What is that, that hath beene? that is now: and that that ſhall be hath now byn: for God requireth that which is paſt.
                  
               
               Eccleſiaſtes. Chap. 3.
               
                  
                     TO all things there is &amp;c. If we were not very dul ſcholers, blinde and earthlye minded, there is inough ſaid in ye two former Chapters, to perſwade vs throughly, that mans eſtate vnder the ſunne, when it is at the beſt, is moſt vain and miſerable. But ſéeing our naughtineſſe is ſuch, that we faſten our loue, and put our truſt in things tranſitorie, although we know them to be ſuch:

the wiſe man goeth on with further perſwaſions to recouer vs (if it be poſſible) from this accurſed and damnable way. He made triall in him ſelfe, being the ableſt man that euer was, in the knowledge and vſe of all excellent thinges vnder heauen: and proclaimeth that there is nothing but vanitie, &amp; affliction of ſpirite.
               
               We ſhall now haue the inconueniences, euils and miſchéefes, which he obſerued to fall vpon other menne, which hee was frée from, (the firſt which hee now dealeth in excepted) and which in déede doe make this life excéeding miſerable. For if Solomon with all his glorie, in the middeſt of his great riches and pleaſures, found no good, what ſhall wée ſay of the life of thoſe, (which are farre the greateſt part of the world) that in the ſteade of his delightes, are laden with euils? I ſuppoſe there is no man ſo ſimple, but can reaſon thus: If the life of Solomon were vexation, what is the life of other men? He was frée from many gréefes that light vpon all other.
               
                  Theſe gréefes did he obſerue, &amp; ſome of them he noteth. But firſt he vſeth one generall argument, as the grounde and foundation therof, which doeth alſo ſerue for confirmation of his former diſcours: which (as I ſaid) he himſelfe, and all his works are ſubiect vnto. It is taken from the time: all things vnder heauen are in time, and therefore changeable wt time. No maruaile therfore, that al creatures, all workes, ſtudies, indeuours, councels, and deſires, be vaine, and no profite remayning, ſéeing time eateth them vp quite.
               
                  To all things (ſaith he) there is an appointed time, and a ſeaſon for euerie purpoſe vnder heauen. All things vnder the ſunne, or, as the holy Apoſtle ſpeaketh 2. Cor. 4. the things which are ſéen, are temporall: and for this cauſe they alter, they varie, they change, they ſuccéeds one another, there is nothing but a continuall turning, and tumbling vp and downe of all, euen as times doe turne and alter. There is nothing conſtant and durable, but it hath a ſeaſon, and then the

contrarie thereunto hath the time alſo, and expelleth it.
               It were infinite to gather euery particular, but he gathereth ſo many as may leade vs to the contemplation and ſight of all the reſt. There is a time to bring forth or to be borne, and a time to die. Theſe two are ſet the one againſt the other. A man, and each liuing thing hath a time when it commeth foorth into the world, and after certaine daies or yeares that turne about, the time for death dooth come. Who, or what can withſtand this? The like is for all works yt are wrought: there is a time for their making, there commeth a time for their marring. We muſt take this by the way, that he doeth not minde to ſhew what is lawfull and right to bee done, but what is done by change of time.
               Men plant trées, which grow and liue many yeres: but trées waxe ſo olde, that they be plucked vp againe. There commeth a time of ſlaughter and killing, and a time to heale the wounded. The mightier ſort build great houſes, &amp; ſo ſtrong,

as it ſéemeth they ſhould continue for euer: but they weare out with age, &amp; the time commeth when other doe pluck thē downe, and build new. Thus is it in all workes vnder heauen. There is nothing but continuall doing, and vndoing that which was done before.
               Euen ſo commeth it to paſſe in all mans affectiōs, and deſires in his works, and in the ſucceſſe of matters. There is proſperitie, health, and good ſucceſſe. Thē doeth he reioyce and laugh, then doeth hée daunce and ſkip for ioy. Aduerſitie followeth in her time, then doeth he wéepe, then doeth he mourn and lament: this we al know by experience. But becauſe he ſaith, There is a time to daunce, I muſt ſpeake ſome what of that. There be ſome which mainteine daunſing, &amp; theſe be their words: Wee can proue by the Scripture yt daunſing is allowed, there is a time (ſaith Solomon) to daunce. I noted before, &amp; they which obſerue well the courſe of things here ſpoken, ſhal find it true, that he diſputeth not what is done lawfullie, but what is done. But I will

not holde them in this ſtraight, I will graunt in this one particular of danſing, that he ſpeaketh of a thing lawfull: yet ſhall ye ſée that they doe fouly abuſe gods word in the ſence they alledge it. There are more kindes of daunſing than one. If they will haue this Scripture ſerue their turne, they muſt ſhewe that ſuch daunſing as is vſed now a daies: wanton danſing, by which men and women nouriſh and féede their fleſhly luſtes, is here mainteyned. By ſuch dauncing ſinne is much increaſed, God is not glorified by it.
               Are they not then aſhamed to make Gods word alow it, &amp; ſo to be cōtrarie to it ſelfe? For Gods word doth condemne chambering and wantonneſſe. Rom. 13.
                  Rom. 13. If any replie, and ſay we can doo it with a chaſt mind, onely for recreation, and in ſober maner, when at a marriage ſuch mirth is to be vſed. I anſwere, that ſuch are not to be ſo diſalowed as the reſt.
               But yet with all wée muſt take this, that euery one is to haue regard not onely of his owne chaſtitie, but alſo for the

preſeruation of the chaſtitie of all other. If thou doo that which is a baite to ſtirre vp, and kindle euill luſtes in other, thou doeſt breake the rule of loue, thou doeſt hurt thy neighbour, therefore take heed how thou daunce. But let this paſſe, that we may goe on: There be many workes of mē, which in their ſeaſon are wrought and haue their time, when their contrarie ſuccéedeth and they vaniſh: There is a time to caſt away ſtones, and a time to gather ſtones. This is not to be reſtrained vnto the particuler expreſſed, but may repreſent many actions of mans life which he doth, and vndoeth of him ſelfe: for the mind doth alter and change often with the times. There is a time to imbrace, that is for marriage, and there is a time to abſtaine. He noteth diuers other things, as a time to find, to loſe, to kéepe, to caſt away, to rent in péeces, &amp; to ſewe together, to kéepe ſilence, and to ſpeake, to loue, to hate, of warre and of peace.
               What doo al theſe, and a thouſand ſuch like, but ſhew that we are ſhut vp in time, the times doo change, and wée are

changed in them. We haue good ſpéed, we haue euill ſpéed, we make, we marre, we alter, we change, we loue, we like, we loath, we miſlike, we are in quiet today, tomorow in trouble, we neuer ceaſe turmoiling, and can make nothing ſtand conſtant, either within vs, as in our mindes, or without vs, in our workes. Whereat he breaketh forth into an exclamation, what profit hath he that worketh in the thing wherein he trauaileth? If we could faſten the eyes of our mind, vpon this which he hath ſet forth in ſome particulers, euen to behold the variableneſſe, the alterations, the change of all creatures, of all workes, of counſels, deuiſes, enterpriſes, euents, affections, and deſires, we ſhould ſée that in déed there is no profit remaining of al the ſore trauaile wherein men forment thēſelues. When peace laſteth ſome clime vp in honour, ſome build, ſome plant: as we ſée the litle Ants buſie to caſt vp their hill, a man doth ſpurne it with his foot, al is ſcattred, thoſe that were in the top, are caſt downe with the loweſt. Euē ſo when the wars

doo come, there is a new face of al things, there is caſting downe from dignitie, breaking downe, and rooting vp, yea many grieuous and horrible ſpectakels doo euery where appeare.
               Here may we conſider againe, the admonition which our Sauiour doth giue, Math. 6. Lay not vp for your ſelues treaſures in earth, where moth and ruſt doo corrupt, &amp; where théeues breake through and ſteale. But lay vp for your ſelues treaſures in heauen, where neither the moth nor ruſt moth corrupt, &amp; where the théeues doo not breake through &amp; ſteale. Here may wée alſo remember what S.1. Tim. 6. Paul ſaith 1. Tim. 6. Charge thoſe that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, and that they truſt not in vncertaine riches: for as all other things haue but their time, ſo is it with riches. There be many waies for men to loſe them, as times doe fall out.
               It is néedleſſe to make rehearſal in the particulars: but I will rather put you in minde of that exhortation which the holy Ghoſt maketh, Pro. 23. Weary not thyProu. 23.
                  
ſelfe ſaith he to be rich: ceaſe from thine owne vnderſtanding. Wilt thou caſt thine eyes vpon them, for ſtraight way they are not. For riches make thē wings, they flie away as an Egle toward the heauens. The rich man doth kéepe them but as a bird in a cage, the dore is no ſooner open, but they whip out &amp; are gone: they mount vp toward the heauens, that is, where the owner can not follow to lay hold of them againe. O yée rich men can ye pull the feathers, or clip the wings of your riches? can ye make them as tame foules to tarrie with yée for euer? they be vncertaine, they haue but their time, doo what yée can to make them ſure.
               I may ſay the like for honours and dignities, for bewtie and fauour, yea for all things vnder the ſunne: they haue but their time, and thē come to naught. Looke vp then vnto the eternall and euer liuing God, he is before and after all time, he is alwaies the ſame. Séeke for to poſſeſſe him for your inheritance: with him there be durable riches: hee will neuer fayle ye. Pray vnto God to teach ye to number

your daies, that ye may apply your harts vnto wiſdome. For to your ſelues, and to your workes there is but a time. It is not in vaine that the prophet ſaith, teach vs to number our daies, that we may applie our harts to wiſdome. For though the times be thus apparantly variable, and inconſtant, yet men are foliſhly blinded. For it will be ſaid, that although a man liue but a time, yet his workes may continue long. For ther be ſome whoſe houſes and auncetrie haue cōtinued fiue hundred yeares, ſome ſay they can ſhew for a thouſand yéeres. Theſe haue ſtood as mightie Cedars, yea as the mountaines themſelues in the middeſt of all ſtormes and tempeſtes. They continue for all the broiles that haue béen in the reuolutions of times: Men may make their workes ſo ſtrong, that they may ſtand for euer. What a goodly thing is it, if their poſteritie may floriſh in honour for a thouſand yeares.
               Alas poore fooles, who is able to make ſound or due proofe of a thouſand yeares? there be many which ſet vp their briſtles

and looke a loft, if they can find that their auncetors haue béene men of worſhip, &amp; continued fiue or ſixe hundreth yeares: let it be a thouſand, how little a part haue they of it. Their fathers daies did not profit them, nor theirs on the other ſide do them any good. They haue not learned that a thouſand yeares are but as yeſterday. They are but as a watch in ye night when they be paſt: yea euen as a tale that is told. We ſée alſo that the mightie ſtrong kingdomes and monarchies of the world, had but their time and are fallen. And ſhall any man be able to make his workes ſo ſure, that they ſhall not haue their time to be broken downe? men doo reach at ſuch a thing, but all in vaine becauſe the ſtate of the world ſhal continue ſtill the ſame, the times ſhall fall out as they haue doone. The wiſe men of the world doe read the hiſtories of former ages: they ſée examples ſet before them of all ſortes, which do as it were in a glaſſe repreſent vnto them the truth of this doctrine.
               For they ſée that all the mighty kings

with their nobles and wiſe counſellors haue laboured in vaine: their thoughts, their coūſels, their works, together with their glorie, are vaniſhed and come to naught: what profit haue they of all their trauaile, more then to be pictured in the Catalogue of kings? and yet theſe labour ſtill, as if their works ſhould ſtand for euer. Either they be deceiued with this, that their wiſdome and policies ſhall be able to doe more, or elſe they be perſwaded amiſſe, that the times to come wil not be ſo variable. For out of al doubt, if they were thus perſwaded, the mightie men and men of renoune that were before vs, did as much as was poſſible by power or wiſdome to be done, that their workes might be dureable, and yet wée ſée all is gone. The changes and alterations of times haue ouerturned them quite.
               This variableneſſe of time will continue ſtill: they would not for a thing of naught caſt away themſelues, I meane by ſetting their harts ſo vpon this world that they loſe eternall glory. And if they yéeld thus farre, that the men of former

ages did as much as they can poſſibly do, but they thinke the times may be better: let them conſider that which Solomon here addeth, concerning this variablenes and change of times. For he doth note diuers points touching this matter.
               Firſt, that God himſelfe hath done it. I ſaw (ſaith he) the trauaile which God hath geuen to the ſonnes of men, to occupie and buſie them therein. It is not the whéele of blinde fortune, whereby al things are ſo toſſed and turned here vnder the ſunne. It commeth not by chance or aduenture, that man and al his doings are ſubiect to the changeablenes of time. It is God, the maker and ruler of heauen and earth, that hath giuen or appointed vnto man, to toile himſelfe, and to be buſied in this ſort.
               All men muſt be occupied, therefore the old things decay, or be deſtroyed, that new may be done. If there were no decay, nor no vndoing of things doon in former ages, there would haue béen inough done long agoe, to ſuffice all that ſhoulde follow. But as he ſaid, there is a time

to plant, and a time to plucke vp that which is planted: a time to break down, and a time to builde. Some vndoe and deſtroy, as falt as other ſet vp. Thus ſhall it continue to the worlds ende, becauſe God hath thus decréed, and ſet it vpon the children of men. The wiſe man beholding this, with other things before mentioned, was clean out of hope, that any of all his goodly works, wrought with ſuch wiſdome, ſhould continue: For who can withſtand Gods decrée?
               Secondly, he ſheweth that this is done of God by a goodly, excellent, and iuſt diſpenſation, he vttereth it in theſe words: he hath made euery thing bewtifull in his time. We haue ſéene certaine particulars, whereby he declared that euerie thing hath his time, and their contraries ſuccéede. A time to be borne, a time to die, a time of warre, a time of peace, a time to loue, a time to hate. Goe through all things vnder heauen, and it is ſo.
               He ſaith alſo, that God hath ſet it thus. It might ariſe in mens minds, how can theſe thinges come from God, are they

beſéeming his gouernmēt? Many things are vglie, and horrible to behold. He affirmeth that he hath made them all be wtifull in their time. In the outward appearance there be a thouſand euil fauoured ſights in the miſchéefes, the miſeries, and calamities that light vpō men: there be monſtrous exploites, loathſome to bée ſpoaken, wherby men are oppreſſed, and their eſtate made miſerable. Come theſe from Gods appointment? Can it agrée with his holy gouernment? Yea (ſaith Solomon) how ſo euer the outward appearance be, if men had eyes to ſée, if men were lightened with Gods ſpirite, it ſhould be apparant vnto them, that all theſe deformed miſchéefes and calamities, are not onely ſent from God for iuſt cauſe, but alſo very bewtifull in their time.
               I muſt here enter into ſome particulars, that it may be cléere, for I knowe this doctrine wil ſéeme ſtrange to the ignorant ſort. He ſaid before, that there is a time of warre, and a time of peace. The one of them, that is to ſay, the time of

peace, is bewtifull. All men ſée the bewtie of peace and commend it, for then m
                     •
                   increaſe and proſper. They plant Orchardes, they buyld faire houſes. Then kingdomes and cities doe flouriſh. But can this be ſaid of the other, namely, of the time of warre. Is it a bewtifull ſight to ſée men ſlaine, to haue their bloud run in the ſtréetes? Is it pleaſant to beholde faire houſes broken downe, Cities and townes burnt and conſumed, the Corne fieldes and Orchardes laid waſt and deſtroyed? Is it delightſome for men to looke vpon the ſauage barbarous Souldiers, when they take their wiues and daughters, euen the ſober matrones, and bewtiful virgins, to rauiſh and defile thē euen before their face? Can any take pleaſure, when the ſwordes, the daggers and ſpeares, are thruſt into the young infants, the litle babes, euē their daughters and their ſonnes, their tender bodies caſt foorth into the ſtréetes, and troaden like mire with the horſes. Is not this lamentable? Shall we ſay that God hath made theſe bewtifull in their time? He ſaith

ſo, and we muſt beléeue him. In like ſort hee ſaid, There is a time to caſt away ſtones, and a time to gather ſtones together: a time to find, a time to loſe: a time to keepe, a time to caſt away. The one part, that is to gather, to find, to kéepe, may ſéeme bewtifull, but not their contraries: As for example, a man gathereth goods, heapeth vp riches, buildeth houſes, and purchaſeth landes. His ſonne doeth come after, and he addeth double and treble, he goeth beyoond his father. It continueth thus for certain generations, vntill the heaps are great: at laſt their ſteppeth in one that ſcattreth all abroad. He is a ruffian, he is riotous, he is a dicer, he haunteth harlots, and ſo conſumeth all that his Auncetors did gather. Is this bewtifull? is this a good ſight? I might go through a number of particulars, but theſe may ſuffiſe to lay open the doctrine which Solomon doeth here teach. I will make theſe manifeſt, &amp; ſo we may iudge of all other contraries, which in their times fall out by Gods prouidence, how he hath made them bewtifull.
               
                  I know it will be ſaid, how can theſe things be bewtifull? Is riot, whoredom, ruffian liues, dicing, or waſting goods and patrimonie, bewtifull? are murthers, bloudſheds, cruelties, rauiſhings of matrones and virgins, waſting &amp; burning all pleaſant things, cōfortable to behold? Theſe and a number moe are vglie, horrible, and dolefull to behold. They be ſins euen of Heathen men condemned. God is holie, iuſt, pure, and righteous, he abhorreth &amp; condemneth all ſinne and wickedneſſe, how can it be ſaid, that he doeth make theſe bewtifull in their time? ſhall moſt foule ſinnes be bewtifull, or ſhall we ſay that God doth approue them?
               I anſwere, that neither doth God approue ſinne, neither is ſinne bewtifull of it ſelfe at any time, and yet this ſtandeth true, he hath made euery thing bewtifull in his time. Wée muſt therefore diſtinguiſh thus: God is the Aucthor of all actions, but the ſinne of the actions commeth not néere him: For hée is infinitely holy and pure, and hateth all wickednes. Hée doth in his prouidēce vſe as inſtruments,

both men and deuils, to bring the works to paſſe, and the ſinne cleaueth onely vnto them. The actions arè good as they bée from the moſt bleſſed and holy God, but theſe inſtruments doo ſinne, and are iuſtly condemned. Moreouer, if we reſpect the ſinne it ſelfe, it is fond, it is lothſome, it is ſorowfull to behold: for who can behold the rauiſhment of women, the murthering of men and children, the burning of cities and townes, &amp; not powre forth teares? Who can ſee theftes, robberies, and ſpoiles, yea all kind of wickednes in ſuch manner committed, as if all the Diuils in hell were loſed, and walked vpon the earth in mans apparell, and not mourne? In this the things are not bewtifull.
               But now in an other reſpect, if we behold, wée ſhall ſée they be all be wtifull in their time: and that is, as they be ſent as iuſt and due puniſhments from God, as the executiō of his wrath, and vengeance for the wickednes of the world, and for the triall of the faith and pacience of his ſeruants. Looke in the time of peace

what ſecuritie there is, what vnthankfulneſſe, what pride, what abuſing of all Gods creatures vnto riot and exceſſe, and ye ſhall ſée, that the ſword, the famine, the peſtilence, and al kinde of miſerable vexations are iuſtly ſent of God, and in that reſpect are bewtifull in their tune. Wée ſée how many doo gette their goods, with couetouſneſſe, with vniuſt dealing, by extortion, briberie, and deceit, vſurie, vnmercifulneſſe to the poore, yea euen to the widow and the fatherles, doo fill many mens purſes.
               Is it not a iuſt reuenge from God, and a due executiō, and in that reſpect a thing bewtifull, that a ruffian, or an vnthrift, doe riſe vp and riotouſly waſt the goods that haue béene ſo naughtily gotten? The Lord God doth in righteouſneſſe gouerne all nations and people of the world, &amp; puniſh their ingratitude. His owne childrē offēding do not eſcape. The exāple of Dauid may ſuffiſe: hée committed adultris with Barſeba, hée cauſed Vrias hir huſband to bée ſlaine with the ſword: the thing diſpleaſed the Lord excéedingly. He

ſent Nathan the prophet vnto Dauid, to ſhew him his ſinne, and alſo the chaſticement that God would ſend him for the ſame. The ſword ſhall not depart from2. Sam. 12. thy houſe for euer.
               I will raiſe vp euill, ſaith the Lord, againſt thée out of thine owne houſe: I wil take thy wiues before thine eies, and giue them vnto thy neighbour: which ſhall lie with thy wiues in the ſight of ye ſunne. Thou diddeſt this thing ſecretly, but I will doe it before all Iſraell, and in the ſight of the ſunne. This was the puniſhment threatned, let vs ſée how the Lord did bring it to paſſe. Firſt Ammon the ſonne of Dauid defileth his ſiſter Thamar. Abſhalom for reuenge being an other of Dauids ſonnes, and brother vnto Thamar by the mother alſo, doeth ſlay Ammon his brother. Afterward, ye ſame Abſhalom doth gather a power of men, and ſéeke to thruſt his Father from the kingdome. Dauid is conſtrayned to flie from Ieruſalem, leauing ſome of his wiues there: thether commeth Abſhalom, and by the counſell of Achitophel
                  
cauſeth a tent to be ſpread, and in the ſight of all the people, went in and lay with his fathers wiues. Here is Gods puniſhment vppon Dauid as hée before threatned. Ammon did commit abominable inceſt: Abſhalom, beſides his murther, his treaſon and other enormities did cōmit the like inceſt with his fathers wiues. The Lord ſaith he did all this.
               But as I ſaid before, the actions were his but not the ſin. The ſinne did cleau
                     •
                   vnto the men, and to the Deuill which drew them into it, vnto whoſe hand th
                     •
                   Lord had iuſtly giuen them ouer. Theſ
                     •
                   ſinnes in themſelues are foule to look
                     •
                   vpon, but as they be puniſhments ſen
                     •
                   of God vpon Dauid for his offence, the
                     •
                   were bewtifull in their time. Thus ma
                     •
                   wée iudge of all the euils, the calamitie
                     •
                   and miſchiefes, which in the variablene
                     •
                   and change of times doe light vpon me
                     •
                   He hath made them all bewtiful in the
                     •
                   time. We muſt come to the third poin
                     •
                   and that is that God vſeth men as his i
                     •
                  
                  ſtruments, and by them as by the mea
                     •
                   he bringeth in all thoſe euils, which 
                     〈…〉
                  
                  
puniſheth the wickedneſſe of the world withall, and ſheweth his glory, except in that which he worketh himſelfe extraordinarily and immediatly: his words are expounded diuers waies by diuers, but I will tranſlate them euen as they ſtand, thus: He hath alſo ſet the world in their hart (except that which man can not find) euen the worke which God worketh frō the beginning to the end. When he ſaith, God hath ſet the world in their heart, hée expoundeth what hée meaneth by the world, euen the worke of God, which hée worketh from the beginning to the end. That is to ſay, euen the whole worke of God, for the turmoiles that be among the nations of the world: ſauing that he hath made an exceptiō by the way, for he putteth in, except that which man can not find. We haue ſéene before how he ſetteth downe euery thing to haue his time and ſeaſon.
               He expreſſed ſundrie particular partes of contraries, by which we may be induced to behold al things that are doone vnder heauen, which hée calleth the world:

and becauſe Gods prouidence directeth all, he calleth it the worke which he worketh. This world (becauſe the things be ſo vniuerſall and ſo many) or this whole worke of God, hath he ſet in mans heart. For menne doo worke it all, except that which man findeth not out, which God hath reſerued to him ſelfe. As for example, he hath at all times ſo gouerned the world, that he doeth many things of him ſelfe without the meanes of men, both in deliuerances of ſome particular perſons, and alſo in preſeruation of his whole Church. He hath ſhewed great wonders aboue mans reach. He doeth ſend dearths and famines, and peſtilences to plague &amp; puniſh the wicked. Theſe and ſuch like excepted: It is in mans hart to doo all the reſt. All the labour and turmoile of doing and vndoing, of making &amp; marring, ſetting vp and deſtroying, wee ſée is in the heart and minde of man. The proſperitie, the aduerſitie, the good ſucceſſe, and the euill ſucceſſe, yea all the miſchiefes, dangers, inconueniences, &amp; euils yt make this life miſerable are wrought by men.
               
                  It is not néedfull that I ſhould ſtande to declare this by particulars, it is ſo euident in euery mans knowledge. We are compaſſed about, both we, and our works vnder the ſunne, with tenne thouſand euils, which the hart of man hath in it for to doe and accompliſh. Wee are ſubiect vnto all the iudgements which God ſendeth extraordinarilie. Our life therefore is nothing but extreme vanitie and miſerie. There is in it no good yt remayneth.
               But as he doeth againe repeate that he ſaw that there is nothing good in thē, but to reioyce and doe good in his life. Alſo, that euerie man eat and drink, and ſee the commoditie of all his labour: this is the gift of God. I néede not ſtand vpon this, being expoūded before, more then this, that he willeth men to reioyce, and to doe good in their life. Which I take here to be referred vnto the true ioye in God, with the partaking of the creatures in ſuch ſort as I ſhewed alreadie. Not as the gluttons, ye drunkardes, the epicures, and ſuch as be geuen ouer vnto fleſhlie luſtes.
               
                  This gift of God, as he calleth it, is not geuen vnto them, they take pleaſure like bruite beaſtes: but when they remember death, or the iudgement ſeate, they are pricked within. They bée like the ſea that reſteth not, but foameth out mire, there is no peace to ye wicked, ſaith my God, Iſaie. 57.
               
               The fourth and laſte poynt now remayneth, which is, that God hath (by an vnchangeable decrée) done all this which he hath ſhewed of the variablenes of all things in time, and with time. There is at one time doing, at another time vndoing. There is good ſucceſſe to day, and as euill to morow. Now mirth, then ſorrowe: proſperitie, and aduerſitie. This hath God ſo appointed, that it cannot bée altered. Marke what he ſaith, I knowe that whatſoeuer God ſhall doe, it ſhal be for euer▪ to it can no man adde, &amp; from it can no man diminiſh. Theſe wordes be effectuall, and plaine, to teach vs, that God almightie which hath made ye world and doeth gouerne it, hath compaſſed about, and ſhutte many vp in vanities, calamities

and miſeries, which are innumerable, euen as it were within walles of braſſe. There is no way to wind out, no way to alter any thing, either to adde, or to diminiſh. No man can change that which God hath determined. He hath in his manifold and vnſearchable wiſdome ſet this courſe and order in the world, to continue to the end. No thing, no purpoſe whatſoeuer vnder heauē, ſhal haue more then the ſeaſon, and then geue place.
               By this we may be taught to beholde the madnes of the children of this world, they ſtriue and indeuour againſt God, no wiſelier, then if one ſhould run his head againſt a thicke wall of braſſe to breake through it. They applie all their ſtudie, wiſdome and power, to make their eſtate firme vnchangeable, and not ſubiect vnto vanitie.
               What inuentions and deuiſes there be, to make themſelues glorious in the earth for euer: what hope to make their poſteritie flouriſh, and their workes (for the greatnes of them) to ſtande euen to the laſt day. Alas poore blinde men, they

forment themſelues in vaine, for God hath decréed before what ſhall become of them, and of all their thoughts. He hath ſet al vnder time to paſſe away, and will they goe about to alter his purpoſe.
               Here is comfort to the godly, when he ſaith, all that God doeth ſhall ſtand for euer, to it can no man adde, from it can no man diminiſh. For this doeth teach, that things fall not out at the wil &amp; pleaſure of men, but are wholy ordered by God himſelfe, which cauſeth all thingesRom. 8. to work together for the beſt to thoſe that loue him. The world doth rage, ye mightie tyrants are in a furie, and doe threatē deſtruction to the church. Many troubles and miſeries ariſe, it ſéemeth there will be no end nor meaſure: ſo ſtrong they be which trouble all, that they appeare to haue the whole ſway of the earth at their commandement. But when they haue done what they can, they goe not one iot or one haire breadth beyonde that which God had before appointed.
               Herein the world is like the ſea, in which God hath laide the waters vppon

heapes. At the ſtormie winds the waues therof ariſe, they ſwell, they rage, they rore, they fome, &amp; threaten to ouer whelm the earth, and to drowne all. But God hath ſet the ſhoare, hee hath appoynted them their boundes and limittes, which they cannot paſſe. Hether ſhalt yu come, and not further, here ſhalt thou lay down thy proud waues. The deuill ſtirreth vp the tempeſtes, and ſetteth all in a broyle vpon the land. The waues doe threaten the heauens, the tyrants are ſo proude to enterpriſe great matters: but Gods prouidence and decrée, that is, the ſhore, further they cannot procéede, for he ſaith, I know that which God doeth ſhalbe for euer, to it can no man adde.
               
               The next words in the text doe ſhew to what ende and purpoſe God doeth all this: and that is, that men ſhoulde feare before him. A moſt worthie ende, both for his glorie, and for mās good. He ought to be feared and honoured, and it is true bleſſednes vnto thoſe which do it. Behold then the excellent wiſdome and goodnes of God, which bringeth light out of darknes,

and life out of death. He hath ſet mā in this vaine eſtate, tranſitory and full of calamities, to drawe his minde vp to his God, to feare, to worſhip, and to depende vpon him, ſéeing vnder heauen there is nothing to ſtay vpon, there is nothing to help or comfort.
               What dulnes is in vs when we finde that all is like a ſea of miſerie? if we look vpon the ages paſt, or the time preſent, and when we are tolde it ſhalbe ſo in the time to come, yet cannot our heartes bée drawē away from it vnto God? He doth it that we ſhould feare before him, but we perceue it not. He leaueth vs nothing here that is worth the caſting our eyes vpon, becauſe we ſhould turne them vnto him. He is conſtant, always the ſame, but the works of man decay, and newe are ſet vp in their ſteade. He demandeth what it is that hath béene, and maketh anſwere, that which is now: and yt which ſhalbe is that that hath béene, for God requireth that which is paſt. All thinges are either paſt, preſent, or to come. Men in times paſt did labour, they are all ſet

a work that liue now, and thoſe that riſe vp after vs ſhall doe the like. They that went before, their workes are decaid and fallen, we doe but the ſame again. Thoſe that come laſt, and fall to it a freſh, when our workes are vaniſhed, ſhall doo nothing but that which hath béene done before.
               Thus all turneth round as a whéele, which hee expreſſeth further in theſe wordes, God requireth that which is paſt. This is not Fortunes whéele, it is God, when men turmoyle, which ſo ordereth the matter, that they can doe no more but that hath alreadie béene done. For when he ſaith, God requireth, it is as much as to ſay, God bringeth back againe that which is paſt.
               Oh poore creatures what do ye? Open your eyes and behold with déepe meditation that which is here ſet before you. Conſider the workes of the ages that are paſt, what is become of them? what ſhall then become of your workes hereafter? God hath decréed, and no man can alter it, that this eſtate of things ſhal continue

to the end. Turne then vnto him, feare him, and forſake theſe vanities, and yée ſhall be bleſſed for euer.

                     17 I ſaid in my hart, God will iudge the iuſt and the wicked, for there is a time for euery purpoſe, and ouer euery worke there.
                     
                        18 I ſaid in my hart concerning the order of the children of men, that God hath giuen them dignitie, and to ſee to, they are beaſtes to themſelues.
                     19 For the condition of the children of men, and the condition of the beaſtes, is euen as one condition to thē. As the one dieth, ſo dieth the other, for they haue all one breath, and there is no excellencie of man aboue the beaſt: for all is vanitie.
                     20 All goe to one place, all was of the duſt▪ &amp; all ſhall returne to the duſt.
                     21 Who knoweth the ſpirit of man, that it goeth vpward, &amp; the ſpirit of the beaſt, that goeth downward to the erth.
                     22 Therefore I ſee there is nothing good, but that a man reioice in his own workes, becauſe that is his portion: for who ſhal bring him to ſee what ſhall be after him?

               I noted the laſt time, that he wold ſhew ſome particulars of the euils

and miſchéefes which hee obſerued▪ to fall vpon others, which doe increaſe the miſeries of this life. Now hee commeth to them, and firſt beginneth with the oppreſſors, and the oppreſſed. God hath made all the inhabitants of the earth▪ of one bloud. He willeth them to dwell together in concord and loue▪ to deale iuſtly, vprightly▪ and with equitie▪ and none to hurt, but to doe good each to other. But all this is gone, through the corruption of our nature, and wee are geuen to oppreſſe, to ſpoyle and deuoure one another like ſauage beaſtes.
               For to méete with this, and for ye preſeruation of mankind the Lorde hath ordeyned the ciuill power, hee hath erected the ſeate of iudgement and iuſtice vppon earth, he hath put his ſword into ye hands of Iudges and ruler 
                     •
                   to right that which is amiſſe. They are by duetie of their office and place to reſcue the innocent, to deltuer the oppreſſed, and to puniſh the wrong doers; This doeth bring much eaſe and quiet vnto the Inhabitantes of the earth: for without it, no ſocietie, or

common wealth can ſtand. There wold be nothing but théeuing, killing and ſpoyling. If this were not ſome what at all times peruerted, there might be much more comfort and reléef to the oppreſſed. But it falleth out as he ſaith, I haue ſeen vnder the ſunne the place of iudgemēt, there is iniquitie, the place of iuſtice, there is wickednes. The wicked ſhould there be puniſhed, and the innocent reſcued, and it falleth out contrarie. The Lord complayneth of this Pſal. 82. HowPſal. 82. long will ye iudge vniuſtly, and accepts the perſon of the wicked? He crieth vnto them to iudge the fatherles and poor, but they heare not.
               I know ſome take it that Solomon doeth not ſpeake here of the iudgement ſeate, but by the word place, vnderſtandeth as much as to ſay, in ſteade. Then is it thus, that the people in place, that is, in ſteade of iuſtice, doe iniury &amp; wrong one another. I could yeald vnto this, but that hee ſpeaketh in this manner, the place of iudgement there is iniquitie, which agréeth rather to a very place, thē
                  
to ſay in ſteade. But it may be obiected and ſaide, where did Solomon behold this corrupting of iuſtice in the very ſeate of iudgement? was not hée the2. Sam. 12. chéefe Iudge in his kingdome? Did hée, or coulde hee beholde ſuch a thing in his his owne daies, and not remedy it? I anſwere, that he ſpeaketh not of that which he had ſéene in one kingdome, or at one time, or which he behelde ſo much with outward ſight. But by an inward light and knowledge he beheld this great euill in all dominions vnder the ſunne, and at all times.
               He did know right wel the great corruption of man, that tyrants ſhould oftē ſitte vpon the higheſt ſeates of iudgemēt. And moreouer, that though the king him ſelfe be iuſt, yet his ſubſtitutes, and ſuch as are put in truſt vnder him, would peruert iudgement many times. For when they ſhould look vprightly into the cauſe, they be drawen awrie by manyreſpectes: for there be many thinges which haue force and ſtrength in them to draw a man awrie from miniſtring true inſtice.

Sometime a gift doeth blinde their eyes, for the Lord ſaith, a gift doeth blind the eyes, and peruert the iudgement of the wiſe. Sometime they accept the perſon of the wocked, for ſome friendſhip, if not toward them, yet for ſome friend which intreateth that fauor may bee ſhewed, as it is vſuall in waightie cauſes that great men write vnto Iudges, and then downe goeth the innocent very often, vnles the Iudge be of great courage, and feare God.
               Sometime there is hatred toward the perſon, for religion. When the iudge is corrupt in opinion that way, as it falleth ont often, becauſe many iudges are ſo addicted to the ſtudie of worldly matters, and ſo wiſe in their owne eſtimatiō, that they muſt haue Gods matters ſquared by their rule: the wiſdome of the fleſh is their rule. Somtime feare carieth awrie, whē as ſome great perſon of honour doth ſpeake or write in fauour of the guiltie. The Iudges would be loth to diſpleaſe ſuch, &amp; ſo in the place of iudgement there is iniquitie: iudgement commeth foorth

wreſted, as the Prophet complaineth. This increaſeth greatly the miſerie of the life preſent, when as we lie open cō
                  tinually vnto a thouſand oppreſſions, where our refuge ſhould be, there we oftentimes find diſcouragement. The prophane and wicked man doeth deale with the innocent euen at his pleaſure, the rich doth iniurie the poore, and when they rome before the iudges, or thoſe that ſhould miniſter iuſtice, euen as if the power were ſet vp for countenance of the vngodly, they are praiſed: the other are rebuked and checked.
               Alas what ſhall men doo, where ſhall they ſéeke comfort? is not this life miſerable? the world is euer full (and neuer more then at this day) of oppreſſions, iniuries, wrongs, and violence, &amp; the place of iuſtice that ſhould right it, doeth often increaſe the ſame. Who is he that hath a peaceable minde, but had rather loſe a great part, if he might chooſe, then goe to the law for to ſéeke iuſtice? how many are vndoone, by going to law, how many are there which with long ſuite &amp; great

expences cā neuer attaine to their right? If he be rich or mighty that doeth the wrong, let him take away houſe or land wrongfully, we doo account it follie for a meane mā to ſeeke for iuſtice. The world is miſerably corrupted this way now, what remedie, what comfort? Doubtles none but that Solomon doth ſet foorth in the next verſe, I ſaid in my heart, God will iudge the iuſt and the wicked: for there is a time for euery purpoſe, and ouer euery worke there. The Lord hath made all men to dwell together vpon the face of the earth: hée is the iudge of the whole world: hée is a iudge by nature: he is iuſtice and truth it ſelfe: he can not doo wrong vnto any: he muſt néedes reſcue and deliuer the iuſt, and execute vengeance vpon the wicked.
               Herevpon Solomon doth gather, beholding withall the confuſion of matters vnder the ſunne, that there ſhall be a day of generall iudgement, when as all both good and bad ſhall come to their account, and when as euery man ſhall receiue according to his déedes. It ſhall not euer be

thus: Violence, oppreſſion, and iniuries haue but their time, and there is alſo the time for iuſtice, as he ſaith, there is a time for euery purpoſe. The laſt clauſe of this ſentence may be taken diuers waies, as namely, that the iudgement ſhall be ouer euery worke: or thus, he that is ouer euery worke is there. The ſenſe both waies is true, and tendeth to one purpoſe: for it is moſt certaine by the ſcriptures that euery worke both good &amp; bad, ſhalbe brought vnto iudgement, and it is God, who is ouer al, that ſhall iudge.
               Let vs here learne of the wiſe man, when we behold oppreſſion and peruerting of iuſtice, to gather aſſuredly that there is a time when things ſhal be ſet in better frame. Let vs not be caſt downe &amp; diſcouraged, when wée ſuffer wrong, and can find no help at the ſeats of iudgement, and places of iuſtice: for the time commeth when the high iudge will take our cauſe into his hand. Becauſe matters now go ſo farre awrie, be ſure there is a day appointed for better order. It cā not ſtand with Gods iuſtice that matters

ſhould thus go cléere away.
               The wicked doo not reaſon thus: but becauſe the Lord doth let them alone, and men doo eſcape with foule factes, they be the bolder, euen as if God did not regardPſal. 50. the thing at all. This I ſay: is a wrong collection, for that God now winketh at oppreſſion, and at ye peruerting of iudgement, it is a ſtrong reaſon to proue that he hath ſet a time vnto which he doth reſerue all cauſes, wée ſhall all come there both the oppreſſor and the oppreſſed. Let vs proceed to that which followeth: I ſaid in my heart concerning the order of the children of men, that God hath giuen them dignitie, and to ſee to▪ they are beaſtes to themſelues. This ſentence is hard &amp; difficult, by reaſon of ſome words in it, which may bée conſtrued diuers waies, and therefore no meruaile though it be vnderſtood diuerſly.
               But to let paſſe how it is tranſlated in others, I will ſhew the cauſe why I take it thus, as I haue ſet it downe. Firſt, here is one word, Dibrath which in the Pſal.
                  Pſal. 110. 
                  110. is vſed for order: in this ſentence of

the Pſalme, the Lord hath ſworne and will not repent, thou art a prieſt for euer after the order of Melchiſedech. This I take here to ſignifie the ſtate and order of ye children of mē. Here is an other word, &amp; that is Barar, which ſignifieth to chooſe, to purge, to declare. I take it here in the firſt ſence or the ſecond, that God hath choſen men or purged thē: that is to ſay, he hath ſet them vp &amp; adorned them with dignitie and honour, and yet to ſée to they be beaſts to themſelues. For choiſe men, ſet vp in dignitie, are called in the holy ſcripture Berurim, which cōmeth of the ſame word Barar. And the Scripture ſaith Pſal. 49. Man is in honour, but ſhall not continue, he is like the beaſtes that periſh. So then touching the ſtate or order of the children of men, God hath giuen them dignitie and honour, but yet they be but as the beaſts to themſelues, as he ſheweth by reaſons afterward. This is ſpoken to pull downe the pride and loftines of mans nature, which doth ſo glory of an excellencie here in ye world. For looke wel vpon it, and we ſhall ſée,

that this honour and dignitie doth not cō
                  tinue, but man becommeth euen as the beaſts. The beaſts haue no order among them, they haue no magiſtracie, no ſeats of iuſtice or ſuch like. But the ſtronger doo oppreſſe the weaker, the wild do pray vpon the tame, there is no place of refuge or ſuccour among them.
               Among men, this is a goodly dignitie, a goodly order, that God giueth the ciuill power, princes and iudges, and men of honour. There are lawes, there be orders, there is authoritie to reſtrayne wrongs and oppreſſions, that they may not be as ye beaſts to deuour one another. Yet do they partly in this become beaſts to themſelues, when the ſtronger do puſh the weaker, and when the ſeat of iudgement doth vphold wickednes. Men are cruell and ſauage beaſts one to an other many waies: but chiefly in death their dignitie doth vaniſh, and they differ not from the beaſts that periſh, as I alledged before, Pſalm. 49.
               
               Therefore he ſaith, the condition of the children of men, and the condition of the

beaſts, is euen as one condition to them: as the one dieth, ſo dieth ye other, for they haue all one breath, and there is no excellency of man aboue the beaſt, for al is vanitie. All go to one place (ſaith he) all was of the duſt, and all ſhall returne to the duſt.
               
               Thus we ſée hée proueth them notwithſtanding their dignitie, to be as the beaſts, becauſe the euent falleth out to be all one, no difference at all appearing. To day a iudge, a ruler, a mightie king, to morrow all one in condition with the vileſt beaſt. Both die alike, age, or ſome ſickneſſe or hurt, doeth cauſe the bodie to pine and languiſh, ſtrength faileth, they abhorre meate, and yéeld vp the breath. The ſame alſo is a like, for both haue noſtrels to draw in the aire, both man and beaſt gaſpe, and yéeld vp the ſame after one ſorte: the beaſt doeth rotte and turne to duſt, &amp; ſo doth the man, for both were made of the duſt, and both returne to the duſt. In all theſe here is as he ſaith, no excellencie of man aboue the beaſt, for all is vanitie.
               
               
                  Thus we ſée man is in honour, but doth not cōtinue, he is like the beaſts that periſh.
               The holy Scripture when it will abate mans high ſtomake, doeth put him in mind, that his breath is in his noſtrels, he is but duſt and ſhall die, and returne to duſt. Now becauſe this fooliſh vaine glory that men haue in themſelues and in the vanities of this world, cleaueth ſo faſt, Solomon vrgeth the matter▪ very ſore, when he maketh no difference at al, nor no excellencie of man aboue the beaſt.
               Let men conſider well of this, and it muſt néedes make them leſſe eſtéeme the glorie of this worlde. Now if they haue riches and be a ſteppe or two in honour aboue other, it fareth with them as if they were of an other kindred, yea as if they were petie gods. But if it could enter into their mind to thinke, I haue honour and dignitie, and glorie here in the world. I am ſet vp aboue the common ſort, but ſhal this differēce betwéene me and them continue? Surelie no: I

ſhall be made equall with the baſeſt men, yea which is more, I ſhall differ nothing at all from the vileſt beaſt. I ſhall haue no excellencie aboue a dogge. His breath is as my breath, we draw in all one aire. Hée and I ſhall yéeld it foorth a like, I ſhall die as hée dieth. My carcaſſe is now deintily ledde, lieth ſofte, is decked with rich apparell, and is honoured: It ſhall bée as vile and as rotten and lothſome as his: wée both returne to duſt, that bodie which now is honoured, within few dayes if a man come to it, he muſt ſtoppe his noſe. Why doo I then ſéeke to glorifie my ſelfe in this vaine eſtate▪ 
                  
                     •
                  
                  ▪ Why doo I not tread downe theſe vanities, and ſéeke the glorie that is of God?
               I ſay if wée could with this noble King, enter throughly into ſuch conſiderations, the vayne worlde ſhoulde not ſo bewitch vs, and carrie vs from God. For who is ſo fooliſhe to labour moſte for that, which within a ſhort time can not make him differre from the bruite beaſtes?
               
                  But it may be obiected, that this is hard to ſay, there is no excellencie at all of man aboue the beaſt, when death commeth, ſéeing the beaſt doeth wholy peariſh: but man hath a ſoule which doth not die, but liueth, though the bodie turne to duſt?
               This obiection doeth Solomon preuent, when he ſaith, who knoweth the ſpirit of man, that it goeth vpward, and the ſpirit of the beaſt that it goeth down ward to the earth? As if he ſhould ſay, though it be moſt certaine that man hath a ſpirite which dieth not with the bodie, but returneth to God that gaue it, (as he ſpeaketh afterward in the laſt chapter of this booke,) and that the beaſt hath no other ſpirit or ſoul, but ſuch as dieth with the bodie, yet this maketh no difference betwéene them touching this preſent
                     •
                   worlde. For whereby can any man gather, in the death of mā, that he differeth or hath an excellencie aboue the beaſt? I there be, it doeth not appeare: neith
                     ••
                   doeth it therefore touch the ſtate of the world. Such as die in the Lord are bleſed,

and doo in that reſpect farre excell the beaſt. But touching this world (about the vanitie and miſerie wherof Solomon diſputeth) there is no difference nor excellencie, nor priuiledge aboue the beaſt. For the men which haue imbraced this preſent world, they haue a ſoule in deede that liueth, but it were a thouſand times better for them, if they had not, but did wholy periſh as the beaſtes. Here is no colour of matter in this ſentence, to vphold the wicked opinion of thoſe deteſtable monſters, which denis the immortalitie of the ſoule. When they alleadge this ſaying of Solomon, yée ſée it is but wreſted.
               Againe, here is no cauſe to moue vs, for feare leaſt we ſhould ſtrengthen that wicked opinion, to take it that Solomon doeth here ſhew what hée iudged by humane wiſdome: for humane reaſon hath not ſo iudged, that men differ nothing at all from beaſts after death. The humane reaſon is ſo blinde, that it will not bée brought to make ſuch a proofe as this, that man doeth not differ from the beaſt,

becauſe all is vanitie, as we ſee he ſaith a litle before in this diſcourſe.
               I ſay therefore it is out of all doubt a matter propoūded by Solomon, through the due contemplation wherof, the proud and loftie mind of man may be brought downe, that he may thirſt for a better eſtate, and ſéeke it: that he may leſſe regard theſe tranſitorie things, in which his condition doeth fall out very ſoone to be all one with the beaſtes. And here we may remember by the way, how abiect and baſe the proud mindes of men be which know not God. They be as loftie in conceit, as if all fortitude and magnanimitie were in them: yea they would ſéeme to be gloriouſe, and yet looke well vpon the matter, and yée ſhall ſée they haue bowed downe themſelues to a baſe condition? when their heart is ſet vpon earthly glorie, which can not long lift them vp aboue the beaſt. In déede this is the valiant mind, to diſpiſe, to tread downe the vaine pomye of this world, to eſtéeme baſely of things tranſitorie, to long for that bleſſed eſtate in which there ſhall no baſenes approch.

And in which it ſhall not be ſaide, man is in honour, and ſhal not continue, he is like the beaſtes that peariſh.
               
               If the ſonnes of great Princes, which are borne to honor and dignitie, ſhould be ſo baſely minded, as to let goe all regarde of their birth and place, and chooſe rather to be ſhepheards, or Plowmen, it would be wondered at. But when God calleth vs to a farre greater glorie, and wee eſtéeme it not, but ſet our mindes vpon the beggarlie pompe of this world, it ſéemeth no maruaile at all, yet the trueth is, that theſe latter are much more to be wondered at, thē thoſe other, they be baſer minded. Let vs goe for ward, it followeth in the next verſe, Therefore I ſee there is nothing good, but that a man doe reioyce in his workes, becauſe that is his portion: for who ſhall bring him to ſee what ſhalbe after him? He hath vttered this diuers times, in which he affirmeth, that there remayneth no good vnto man of all his trauaile after death. To reioice in his workes, to take part while he liueth, is all the portion that he can haue of

things vnder the ſunne, for he ſhall neuer be brought againe ſo much as to haue the ſight of any thing that ſhalbe after him. God hath ordeyned that we ſhal haue the vſe of his creatures to ſerue for preſent neceſſitie, which we may reioyce in, not like gluttons, epicures, or riotous folke, but by them to haue our hearts lifted vp to the geuer.
               Mans nature is not onely able to doe the former, namely, gluttonie and exceſſe: but is prone thereunto. But this later is the ſpeciall gift of God, as hee taught vs in the ſecond Chapter: ſuch as haue not this, haue no portion at all of the riches &amp; goods which they poſſeſſe, bee they neuer ſo wealthie: Unleſſe we will account it a portion which differeth not from that which bruite beaſtes doe equally enioy. For they take pleaſure in ſwéet paſtures they haue their delights. Contrariwiſe, ſuch as haue a portion in the creatures, reioiſing in them, as by them being lifted vp to reioyce in God, are not hindered, though they haue little. For it is writtē, a ſmall thing which the righteous haue,

is better then the great reuenewes of thePſal. 37. wicked, Pſal. 37.
               
               It followeth, I turned and behelde all the oppreſsions that are wrought vnder the ſunne, &amp;c. I noted vnto you that hée dealeth with the oppreſſors, and oppreſſed: and hauing firſt propounded what he beheld the ſtate of mans life to be in that former, now hee commeth to that other. When he ſaith he beheld all the oppreſſions that are wrought vnder the ſunne, it confirmeth that which I taught you before, namely, that it was not with bodily ſight, but with inward contemplation of minde: he did finde that euen vnder the beſt kings it coulde not be auoyded, but that in the kingdome there would be oppreſſions. For ſuch as be put in truſt to execute iuſtice, doe ſoone ſwerne, the corrupt nature of man is ſuch: then how can it be auoyded where a wicked Prince is ſet vpon the throne? If the king himſelfe be as a deuouring Lion, what wil his of
                  
                     •
                  icers and miniſters be? This did Solomon vew throughlie, and therfore ſaith: turned and beheld all the oppreſsions

that are wrought vnder the ſunne.
               
               We may learne by his ſpeache here, when he ſaith, I turned and beheld, for it doeth vs to witte, that he fixed and bene the eyes of his minde euen whollie, for the time, vppon the oppreſſions that are wrought. He applied all the force of his wiſdome and knowledge, to ſearch this thing aright: and ſo did he

               What a miſerable condition is this, that oppreſſions are alwaies ſo many &amp; ſo grieuous, and none to comfort the oppreſſed. Where there is ſtrēgth &amp; might, there they wrong the weaker, euen as the ſtronger beaſtes doo puſh and harme the febler? there be multitudes of poore men in the world, whoſe wiues and children, through oppreſſion of the rich, haue ſcarce bread to put in their mouths, or rags to hang vpon them. The landlords ſet ſuch rent of their grounds, that they labour and toile like horſes, ſpend their ſtrength, and can get nothing, which bée the tenaunts. This is a cruell part, for they doo euen as it were, eat the fleſh, and drinke vp the bloud of theſe and of their children.

                      And I account him better thé them both which hath not yet been▪ for he hath not ſeene the euill works which

are wrought vnder the ſunne. Hée doth eſtéeme the miſeries, ſo many &amp; ſo great which fall vpon men by oppreſſions, that

                  e cōmendeth the ſtate of the dead, aboue the caſe of thoſe which remaine aliue: yea he doeth account him beſt at eaſe which hath not béene. The dead, though they be now rid and freed, and in that reſpect better then the liuing, yet becauſe they haue paſſed through the calamities of this life, and borne their burthen of them, 
                     •
                  e maketh them inferiour to thoſe which are vnborne, becauſe they haue not ſéene the euill worke that is wrought vnder the ſunne.
               He ſetteth this life before vs, as a ſea or goulfe full of ſtormes, vnquietnes and troubles, death is as it were the hauen &amp; landing place, where menne are ſet frée. But they are moſt at eaſe which neuer came in it, they haue not felt, nor taſted of theſe bitter blaſts, nor béen toſſed with vs. This being true, what ſhal we thinke of thoſe which ſéeke feliciti
                     •
                   and good in this world? But it may be ſaid, how can this be true which Solomon ſpeaketh?

The wicked goeth through many troubles in this world, yet when he is dead &amp; freed from them he is not in better, but in worſe caſe, feeling aſſuredly, that he is dā
                  ned. The godly, although of all other the moſt miſerable in this world, (if we reſpect only ye waight of afflictiōs) yet they be in ioy after death, are happy that euer they were borne, &amp; therfore it can not be ſaid, that he which hath not yet béene is better then they. I anſwere, yt 
                  Solomon doth not reſpect any thing in this cōpariſon, but that which is vnder the ſun. He doeth proue that vnder heauen, there is naught but vanitie.
               He doeth not in this place medle with that which is out of the world: that is, either with ſaluation or damnatiō. We ſée the men that ſéeke good in ye world, doe ſet thoſe reſpects alſo aſide: ſo that he dealeth now within their compaſſe. Is this true, that reſpecting ye miſeries of this world, the dead be in better caſe then the liuing, &amp; he that hath neuer béene borne better at eaſe then they both? Is it not then alſo true, that he ſaid, vanitie of vanities, all is

vanitie, there is no profit to a man of all his trauaile vnder the ſunne? Why then doo men ſet their heart vpon this miſerable life? what will they find in it?
               The next ſentence ſetteth foorth another euill which might make this life vnpleaſant, when he ſaith, I ſaw all trauaile and al perfection of the worke, that this is the enuie of a man from his neighbor, this alſo is vanitie, and affliction of ſpirite. Wee haue heard how miſerable he iudged this life by reaſon of oppreſſions: now hee ſpeaketh of that which addeth further miſerie. It is but a ſmall thing which man hath allotted him here, euen to reioyce in his workes, and yet he cā not enioy the ſame quietly, or without vexation. God geueth ſkill in all maner of workes which are wrought vnder the ſunne. The greater giftes he geueth, the greater perfection doe they ſhew in their workes that haue them. It is (after a ſort) to be iniurious to God himſelf, whē men doe not geue the due praiſe vnto ſuch men that doe ſo excell in giftes of ſkill. They ſhould be honoured, and haue matter

to reioyce, but they be enuyed. The more perfect they be, the more dooth enuie repine. This ſpringeth from vainglorie, and couetouſnes withall.
               Men would be prayſed, and haue the chéefe fame and profite of their ſcience. If God haue geuen more perfection vnto an other, it gréeueth them, they depraue, and diſgrace all that euer they can. From hence doe flow foorth many annoyances, which make this life gréeuous.
               To conclude then (beloued) ye may ſée alſo out of this portion of Scripture that I haue now handled, that the vanitie and vexation of this life is very great, &amp; ſhall euer continue. God geue vs grace to conſider of it, and to be ſo much further drawen from things tranſitorie.

It were inough to make our preſent eſtate nought, if there were no more but the iniuries in body, goods and name, which we lie open vnto continually, and muſt beare from others. But this is not all: for if there were none to hurt vs, we are ready to annoy our ſelues, and that

many waies. Thrée ſortes are here brought in, which are their owne fo

                  s, and which heape miſeries vpon themſelues: the ſlouthfull perſon, the miſerable niggard, and the wilfull conceited man. He beginneth with the ſlouthfull, becauſe he had ſpoken of the perfection of trauaile in the former verſe. Let a man trauaile with wiſdome and perfection, he ſhal be enuied: let him ceaſe &amp; be ſlouthfull, it is his deſtruction, as we ſhall vnderſtand by that which is here taught. There be harmes on euery ſide. The foole foldeth his hands, this is ſpoken of the ſlouthfull or idle perſon. It may be demaunded how we know that he ſpeaketh this of ye idle, ſeing he doth not name him: he ſaith not ye ſlouthfull, but the foole foldeth his hands. The foole cōprehendeth mo then ſluggards &amp; idle perſons: I anſwer, that the deſcription is of a ſluggard very plaine &amp; manifeſt. For wheras God hath laid this vpon Adam and all his ſonnes, In the ſweat of thy browes thou ſhalt eat bread. Gen. 3. And he that will not labour, muſt not eat. 2. Theſſ. 3. Hée

hath alſo giuen hands to that purpoſe. He that worketh is ſaid to lay to his hands, &amp; the works are called the works of our hands. Contrariwiſe, he that is idle is ſaid to fold together his hands. It may then be demaunded why hée doeth not name the ſluggard, but vſe ſo generall a name as foole? It is for ſpeciall cauſes, for the idle which foldeth his handes, is almoſt a foole alone. Againe: In the Prouerbes he ſaith, the ſluggard is wiſer in his owne conceipt, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon. He taketh himſelfe the wiſeſt of many, that hée doeth ſpare his body, when other take paines, and he is deceiued, for it is to his great miſerie and deſtruction. The holy ghoſt doth of purpoſe ſet him forth to be cleane contrarie vnto that which he boaſteth of, and that doth nippe ſore.
               For ſo dealeth S. Paule with thoſe which let goe wholeſome doctrine, and giue themſelues to vaine ſpeculations. He ſaith they be vainely puffed vp and know nothing. 1. Timoth. 6. What can grieue ſuch men more, then when they

doo looke to be accounted the wiſeſt of all, and to know more then any (he ſaith) they be puffed vp and know nothing. So the ſluggard ſéemeth to be very wiſe, and therfore he noteth him by the word foole, as by his proper name, for he hath a chief place among fooles, cā there be any greater folly, then to bring ſo great miſerie vpon himſelf, that he eat his owne fleſh. Wée all doo know that it is a great extremitis which canſeth a man to bite and eat the fleſh from his owne armes. With ſuch doth he compare the idle, becauſe he doth deuour himſelfe. It will be ſaid, it hath béene ſeldome or neuer heard that anie hath lien ſtil wt ſlouth, and fed vpō his own fleſh. We may not ſo vnderſtād Solomon, that the ſluggard doth in déed eat his own fleſh wt his téeth, but denoureth himſelfe with ſuch miſerie, that it is all one as if he did. For as he ſpeaketh in the Prouerbes, yet a litle ſléepe, yet a litle ſlumber, yet a litle folding of the hands, together (there we may ſée who the foole 
                     •
                  s which is deſcribed by folding his hāds)

                  nd thy pouertie commeth like a trauellor,

and thy neceſſitie like an armed mā: by this he telleth that pouertie both come vpon the foole that foldeth his hands vnwares, and neceſſitie taketh hold of him ſo ſtrongly, that it can not be withſtood. For the trauellor commeth vnwares, &amp; the armed man commeth ſtrongly.
               He ſaith alſo that the ſluggard ſhalbe clothed with ragges, &amp; in very déed what followeth idlenes, but ſhamefull beggerie? he doth want, he doth hunger, he doth vſe deceipt &amp; coſenage, yea he doth ſteale. He commeth to the ſtockes, to the priſon, to the whippe, and to the gallowes, his wife and children are beggars. Doth not this man now eate vp his owne fleſh? is not this a right foole, may he not be ſo called as by his proper name? the world doth ſwarme full of theſe fooles, they be in euery countrie, in euery citie, in euery village, yea it is certaine they be almoſt in euery familie, and many together in ſome houſe.

of ſpirite.
               
               This ſentence may be vnderſtood two wayes: for eyther Solomon ſetteth it downe as a doctrine, and then the ſence is this, that it is better to haue a ſmaller portion of riches with moderate care and trauaile, then to haue great aboundance with toyle and vexation of ſpirite: and that is very true, and then is it ſet down as the meane betwéene the ſlouthful and the miſerable drudge, ſpoken of next: or els he ſpeaketh in the perſon of the ſlothfull, ſhewing how he perſwadeth himſelfe vnto idlenes, that he had rather fare thinly and take his eaſe, then to wearie himſelfe with labour, for to get riches. It is a true ſaying, when it is applied againſt an ouer gréedie deſire or riches: yet is it a bad reaſon, as the ſluggard vſeth it, to his purpoſe. For, he carrieth himſelfe by it, not vnto moderate care and trauaile to prouide things neceſſarie, but in déede into idlenes, and beggeris. Hée ſaith, One handfull, (that is, a little,) is better with quiet reſt, than two handfulls with labour: But he hath not that

one handfull at his will, for the ſlugga
                     ••
                   luſteth, and hath nothing, Prou. 6. Let it not ſéeme ſtrange, that the idle doe abuſe a true ſaying to colour their lazines: ye ſhall finde it ſo in other vices. The prodigall ruffian beholdeth the couetbus niggard, and what ſaith he? There is a miſerable caitife, he maketh his money his god. I will neuer (ſaith he) be a ſlaus to my purſe, I will make golde my ſeruant, andiſo he poureth foorth ſo long as he hath any, and that riotouſlie, where there is no néed. The coustous man looketh vpon him, O (ſaith he) yonder bea
                     ••
                   follo weth his pleaſure, he is an vnthriſt, he is worſe then an Infidell (ſaith the Scripture) which prouideth not for his familie.
               Thus doe men with true ſentences ſéeke to colour their ſinnes, and are caried into extremities, and ſo doeth the idle foole here. He ſéeth men labour, and take paines for their ſuſtenaunce, and to prouide ſomwhat for their children. O (thinketh he) theſe are fooliſh men, they vexe &amp; wearie themſelues, I had rather haue a

cup of béere and a morſel of bread with eaſe, then to haue all their good cheare with the paines which they take. This no doubt, is a ſwéet reaſon vnto fleſh and bloud, which ſhunneth labour, and is prone vnto idlenes and luſte. It cauſeth thouſands to ſéek eaſie occupations. Brethren, withſtand this temptation, remē
                  ber that God hath laide vpon euery man that he ſhall trauaile carefully in his vocation. As no man ought to ſet his heart vpon riches, ſo ought all to beware of ſlouthfulnes, for it is a follie that bringeth great calamitie in the end.
               Thus haue we ſéene one ſorte of men that plague themſelues: now followeth another. I behelde a vanitie vnder the ſunne, there is one, and there is not a ſecond, &amp;c. He deſcribeth ſuch a man as puniſheth himſelf with extreme care and labours to heape vp riches, and cā neuer haue his eye ſatiſfied: yea ſuch a one as is a nigard to his owne bellie, and doeth euen grudge to beſtow any good thing vpon himſelfe. When a man hath a wife and children, brethren or kinred, there

bee ſome bondes of naturall affection, which may moue him to lay vp ſom what to geue vnto them. When it is ſo, there ſeemeth to be a iuſt excuſe, (as in déede it is commēdable where meaſure is kept) but this is to be wondered at, that there ſhoulde be ſo cruell a ſicknes in our nature, that a man being alone, hauing no ſonne, nor any kinred to prouide for, is yet ſo inſatiable, that he can neuer think he hath inough, but doeth continuallie whippe and torment himſelfe wt thoghts and ſorowful cares, and with paines and nigardly pinching.
               He doeth alſo geue vs to vnderſtand, how blinde and fooliſh this man is. For, he hath not the wiſdome to thinke in him ſelfe, for whom doe I toile, and defraude my ſoule of good? If a man could but reaſon thus in his heart, I haue plentie of riches, I haue no childe, I haue no néere kinſman, for whome doe I torment my ſelfe with care to get riches? Why ſhold not I enioy part of them my ſelfe? It would a little eaſe him of his burthen. Peraduenture it will be ſaid, there bee

fewe thus miſerable. If a man woulde ſéeke, he ſhoulde hardly finde tenne ſuch in a whole ſhire: why then doeth Solomon bring it in to declare the miſerie of this life, ſéeing it lighteth but vpon here and there an odde perſon? I aunſwere, that in déede there be fewe to be found which haue no childe, nor nigh kinred, and yet are extreme néedie, and of a miſerablé nigardlines. But we muſt vnderſtande that he ſpeaketh of a common infection. It is in many thouſandes, but he doeth declare it, chu
                     ••
                  ng ſuch a perſon to ſet it foorth in, as in whom the diſeaſe is broken foorth, and hath nothing to couer it.
               Shall we thinke, that to want childrē and kinred, doe bréede this vile maladie, nay that doeth but detect it: As the world doeth ſwarme full of idle fooles, ſo is it certaine, that there be thouſands of theſe miſerable hard men, which moyle in the world as baſe drudges, to get and heape vp riches for their children, which if they had no children, yet their diſeaſe woulde remayne with them. He ſaith this is vanitie,

and this is an euill affliction. And doubtles who can deny but that the life of ſuch men is moſt miſerable.
               Now becauſe this miſer, though hée be among men, yet liueth (if it may bée called a life) vnto himſelfe, as he ſaith, he is one, and his minde cannot admit any fellow in that he poſſeſſeth, in which hée pincheth his owne bellie, and ſaith it nay euen when it cryeth vnto him for ſomewhat. He wil ſet foorth further euils and incōueniences of his life by ſhewing the good which commeth of the contrary, that is, the ſocietie and felowſhip of life. Two are better than one, they can doe more work, and many works together which one cannot, and ſo they haue a good reward for their labour.
               There be many commodities in laboring together. Companions are in ſocietie, if one of them fal, his fellow lifteth him vp. But he which is alone and doth fall, wo be▪ to him, there is no helpe for him. If two lie together they are warm, but one alone can not be warme, if any doe ſet vpon one and would be to ſtrong

for him, two will be able to reſiſt: and a thréefold cord is not eaſily brokē. Where men are linked together in ſocietie and friendſhip, they be ſtrong and can not eaſily be iniuried. By theſe his meaning is to ſhewe the manifold miſchisfes which the worldly drudge coueting to liue by himſelfe, doth fall into.
               Let vs note thus much, that men are diſſociate and liue a ſunder, gréedineſſe of wealth is a great cauſe of it. They can not abide that one ſhould haue any gaine by another, they will beſtow nothing vpon any to noriſh loue. And thus they draw euils vpon themſelues, and make their life full of miſeries. Where he ſaith of the worldly drudge, that there is no end of all his labour, alſo his eye is not ſatiſfied with riches, though he haue neither ſonne nor brother, I feare many wil take none but ſuch to be couetous: leaſt any ſhould be deceiued in taking this to be the onely deſcription of a couetous man, I will ſtand ſomewhat vpon it. In déed it is the deſcriptiō of a couetous mā, but yet of one that is in a déepe degrée of

couetouſnes, yea of an extreme miſer and drudge. A man may come certaine degrées ſhort of him, and yet be couetouſe, and ſo couetouſe that ſhe Scripture calleth him an Idolater, making riches his truſt▪ and ſo his God, he ſhal not enter into the kingdome of heauen.
               Firſt, if a man haue many children for which he is bound to prouide by his trauaile, and to teach them to worke, yet to haue an inſatiable deſire for riches, to toyle without end, is condemned, it is a ſauage thing, to liue (which many doe,) without ſocietie of neighbors, as ye ſhall ſee many ſo couetous that they admit no companions. I will ſay further, though he doo not defraud his ſoule of good, but doo féed of them, yea though he come to be after a ſort ſatiſfied and haue enough, yet he may be couetouſe: for couetouſneſſe is not onely in the gréedie deſire of hauing more, or in pinching the bellie, but chiefly in truſting in riches. God hath giuen vs our life, he hath commaunded vs to trauaile for ſuſtenance, but yet ſo as that we depend vpon him, and know that he

doth féed vs, &amp; maintaine our life. Faith in him, is ſhe keye of our ſtore houſe, if we ſtay vpon riches, as though our life were maintained by them, be guiltie of couètouſnes.
               Our Sauiour ſaith, take héed and beware of couetouſneſſe, Luke 12. and then for example bringeth in a man, whoſe garners brought foorth ſuch ſtoare, that he had not roome to lay it vp: hee pulled downe his barnes, and builded greater, and then he ſaid, Soul thou haſt enough laide vp in ſtore for many yeres, eate, drinke, and be merie. Thou foole, this night ſhall they take away thy ſoule, &amp;c. Here is one ye ſée, doeth eate, drinke, and is merrie; hath enough for many yeres, and yet condemned as couetous. The wretched drudge here deſcribed by Solomon, goeth farre beyond this, and yet this is not excuſed▪
               
               We haue now in our daies, it may be, but here and there one, which fitly in euery reſpect agréed with this deſcription. For though there be many that cannot be ſatiſfied wiſh goodes, that neuer reſt

toyling, that robbe their own bellies, yet fewe of them be without children or kinred.
               Well, let it be they differ ſome what, yet they be but baſe drudges. Of the laſt ſort, that is, ſuch as ſtay and truſt vppon riches, there be infinite: for all are ſuch, vntil God worke in them the regeneration. Ye ſhall heare many ſay, I thanke God I am not conetous, If I were ſure to haue inough but to liue withall. I woulde haue leſſe care, and take leſſe paines. It is in ſome ſence, and as ſome ſpeake it, as much as to ſay, if I were ſure that Mammon my God were ſo great to kéep me, I would wiſh no more. Theſe men are afraid their riches will not ſuffice them and their poſteritie. For they imagine that their children can not liue but by them.
               It wil here be obiected, that it is lawfull and requiſite to make prouiſion, and to lay vp for the children: and dayly experience doeth teach, that ſuch as haue litle or nothing left, doe ful ill. I anſwere, we muſt ſo lay vp, that we yet truſt not

to the riches which be vncertaine, but to the liuing Lord. Our life dependeth vpon him, and ſo doe the liues of our children. And where it is ſaid, they doe ful il which haue little or nothing left them, that is through vnbeléefe. Is it maruell though the Lord ſuffer thouſands of ſuch as truſt in riches, to be depriued of his bleſſing? They fayle of riches, and haue no God to ſtay: vpō, and ſo doe pilfer and ſteale. But ſuch as feare the Lorde, and truſt in him, ſhall ve fed in the time of dearth. I haue béene young, and now am olde (ſaith the Prophet) yet ſaw I neuer the righteous forſaken, and his ſeed begging their bread.
               We ſée alſo many left in wealth that come to beggerie, and thouſandes lefte with nothing, which come to be wel able to liue. The parents which prouide that their children may haue prouiſion made for the fleſh, to fulfill the luſtes thereof, doe often geue them a knife to cutte their owne throate. For they be idle, and riotous, and learn no good trade to get their liuing. If that be once ſpent which was

left, they muſt begge, or ſteale. Thus I haue ſtoode ſomewhat largely, leaſt any ſhould take none to be couetous, but ſuch as to whom in euery reſpect the deſcription here made by Solomon doeth agree.
               We muſt now come to the third ſort of men which do plague thēſelues. Wée haue dealt with the idle, &amp; with the miſerable couetouſe: there remaineth that foole which is wilfull and conceipted. He deſcribeth him in theſe wordes, that knoweth not to bee admoniſhed any more. He hath ſuch an opiniō of his owne wiſdome, and is ſo addicted to follow his owne braine, that let neuer ſo good counſell and admonition be giuen, he will not follow it. To make manifeſt how great the harme and dammage is, which this man doeth draw vpon himſelfe, and the miſchiefes and ſnares into which he falleth, Solomon doth very excellently ſet it foorth by compariſon.
               This foole (for ſo he termeth him) let him haue all the aduantages that may be to ſuch an one, yet ſhall they not deliue
                     •
                  
                  
him. Age is a great matter to be regarded, and a great helpe to goe through, becauſe it hath ſéene much. Riches and honour, and authoritie eſpecially when they be with the greateſt, as in kings, muſt néedes doo excéeding much. But yet all theſe, that is, age, riches, honor, power or authoritie, ſhall not be able to deliuer the wilful conceipted foole, that knoweth not to be admoniſhed, any more, from miſeries and dangers, no though hée be a king.
               This is the cauſe why he ſaith, better is a poore child that is wiſe, then an old king which is a foole, and knoweth not to be admoniſhed. And to ſhew how vn

                  elpe, namely his yeares of experience, 
                     •
                  is riches, honour and power, he ſetteth 
                     •
                  ne that wanteth all theſe in better caſe. For a poore child hath not experience: he 
                     •
                  anteth power, for both tender age and 
                     •
                  ouertie bring cōtempt. He hath nothing 
                     •
                  ut wiſdome, and that wiſdome but of a 
                     •
                  ild, yet is he better thē the other. Thus

are we taught what miſchiefe hedſtrong follie doth carrie with it.
               But I muſt here make the matter a little plainer. It will be ſaid, what is this to declare the vanitie of life preſent. We ſhall ſeldome find ſuch a king, and if it fall out oftenner, yet doeth it touch but a few. I anſwer firſt that when this is a king, all the whole realme doth ſmart for it. A wiſe king is a great bleſſing vnto all his ſubiects. On the contrary ſuch a foole as is here deſcribed to be wilfull, and not knowing to be admoniſhed by wiſe coū
                  ſellors, doeth not onely harme himſelfe, but wrappeth all his kingdome in calamities. Great menne draw many with them, they fall not alone.
               Secondly, I anſwere that Solomon doth not meane to ſpeake this onely of a king, but by way of compariſon to include all other degrées of men. For thus muſt we reaſon, If an old king that is a foole, and knoweth not to be admoniniſhed any more, be through his wilfulnes &amp; headie conceipt, in worſe caſe then a poore childe, then other menne of leſſe

power and wealth, though they be noble and rich can not be ſafe, and how ſhal the inferiour ſort of people then eſcape, I meane ſuch as be wilfull?
               Thus wée ſée how it concludeth all ſorts of mē that be addicted to their owne will, and be ſo wiſe in their owne eyes, that they wil not be counſelled. Now let vs ſée the difference betwéene them, by which is laid open the harme which hée doth to himſelfe. The one he ſaith (which is the poore childe) commeth out of priſon to raigne, alſo the other (that is the king which is a foole, and knoweth not to bée admoniſhed) is borne poore in his kingdome. Here is wonderfull difference: the one out of pouertie and afflictiō riſeth vp into princely eſtate: the other doeth fall downe from his dignitie and power into calamitie. We haue example of this in holy ſcripture, poore Ioſeph was ſold for a bond man, he was caſt into priſon, and from thence he was lifted vp to be ruler ouer all Egipt. Sedekiah did not humble himſelfe before Ieremie the prophet at the mouth of the Lord, 2. Chron. 36. and

therefore he was caſt downe. All wilfull fooles are not kings or princes, and ſo can not fall ſo high. But miſerable are the plagues if we behold them, among the children of men, which are wrought by wilfull conceipted fooles. It is a common ſicknes, euery man almoſt is wiſe, and many are ſo full with the opinion of wiſdome, that they deſpiſe good councell, and good admonition. Looke what they ſet vpon, they go through with it in a gard, they plague others &amp; vndoo themſelues, they be vnrecouerable.
               For in the prouerbes Solomon ſpeaketh thus: If thou braie a foole in a morter with a peſtle among wheat, yet will not his fooliſhnes depart from him. This is to be vnderſtood of the ſimple foole, there is no tawing that can bring him to any paſſe: inſtruction or ſtripes and all will not ſerue: a foole will be a foole ſtill doe what ye can. In an other place of the Prouerbes, he ſaith thus, ſéeſt thou a mā that is wiſe in his owne conceipt, there is more hope of a foole then of him. Yée ſée he leaueth litle hope of a foole, when

braying in a morter wil not ſerue. What hope is there then of this other kinde of foole, that is of him that is wiſe in his owne eies, whom he affirmeth to be the harder.
               In this place he is called a foole, not that he is ſo ſelie as to want common ſence, but becauſe there is no greater follie then for a man to be wiſe in his owne eies. There be many of theſe fooles which be craftie fooles, they be déepe in fetches, ſuſpicious, vaineglorious, and proude. It is not poſſible with wordes to expreſſe what inconueniences and plagues theſe bring vnto countries, townes, and families where they beare ſway: ye ſhall ſée them like vnto vnbrideled coltes. It is no meruaile though Solomon did behold theſe, and bring them in as a part of the plagues which are vnder the ſun. There be an innumerable rabblement of idle fooles, which fold vp their hands, and eat their owne fleſh. There be many miſers which turmoile without end to heape vp riches for they can not tell whom: they pinch their owne bellies. There be alſo

as we may well perceiue, if we looke vpon the quarrels in law, and contentions among ſocieties and cōpanies, that there be alſo very many conceipted fooles, all is full of fooles, the whole world is troubled with fooles. If there be mo ſortes, they are not here mētioned, becauſe theſe thrée are ſufficient to be brought forth vpon the ſtage.
               Learne out of this place a neceſſary leſſon, when ye be to chooſe any to bear
                     •
                   office of gouernment, either alone or together with other, take heed that ye make not choiſe of ſuch fooles, that is of ſuch as be wiſe in their owne eſtimation. Such men will trouble all, the more wit they haue the more daungerous ye ſhall finde them, the more wilfull and headie, and the further of from receyuing admonitiō. Men can liue no pleaſant life but where there is the comfort of ſocietie. Miſerable therefore is the condition of this preſent life through the multitude of theſe three ſortes of fooles, which are moſt noiſome to themſelues, and bring vexation vnto others.
               
                  Let vs goe forward, I ſaw (ſaith he) al the liuing walking vnder the ſun with the ſecond childe which ſtandeth vp in his ſteade. This is to be vnderſtoode of the ſucceſſion of kings, and great men of the earth. He ſpake of an olde king that is a foole, he doeth in contemplation behold him thrown down from his throne, and forſaken of all his ſubiectes, He doth alſo▪ behold them, euen all the liuing that walke vpon the earth, walking, or ioyning thēſelues with ye newe king, whom he calleth the ſecond childe that ſtandeth vp in ſteade of that olde foole caſt downe. He nameth him a childe, becauſe he had made the compariſon betwéene an olde king that is a foole, and a poore child that is wiſe. The foole falleth from his honor, the childe commeth out of priſon for to raign. He calleth him the ſecond, becauſe he ſpake but of two.
               What then? ſhall the ſtate of this ſecond childe, this wiſe king, be ought ſaue vanitie? Doubtles no. The ſicknes of the people is ſuch, that he ſhall not be delighted in but for a time. Thoſe that

come after will not reioyce in him. He ſaith, there is no ende of all the people, that is, no ſtop or ſtay, they neuer come to reſt in any that haue béene before thē, which may be ſaid, thoſe that haue béene rulers ouer them. The people delight ſtil in new kings, the ſunne riſing is honoured aboue the ſunne ſetting: and ſo the wiſe childe comming to raigne, findeth nothing but vanitie, and ſore vexation of ſpirite.

                        BE not raſh with thy mouth, neither let thy heart make haſt to vtter a thing before God, for God is in heauen, and thou art vpon earth, therefore let thy wordes be fewe.
                     2 For as a dreame commeth foorth by the multitude of buſineſſe, ſo the

voice of a foole by the multitude of wordes.
                     3 When thou voweſt a vow to God, be not ſlack to pay it, for he is not delighted with fooles: perform that thou haſt vowed.
                     4 It is better not to vowe, then that thou ſhouldeſt vowe, and not performe it.
                     5 Suffer not thy mouth to cauſe thy fleſh to ſinne, and ſay not before the angell that it is an error, why ſhould God be angrie at thy voice, and deſtroy the worke of thy handes.
                     6 For as in the multitude of dreames there be vanities: ſo in the multitude of wordes, but feare thou God.

                     TAke heede to thy feet, &amp;c. I did ſhew you (beloued in Chriſt) that the purpoſe of king Solomon in this book is to teach mē how to come

to true bleſſednes. I did alſo note that it conſiſteth of two partes. For firſt he laboureth to draw men out of the wrong way, that is, from ſetting their heartes vpon any thing vnder the ſunne, to ſéeke good therein. And this hath he dealt in from the beginning of the book vnto this place, as we haue ſéene.
               Now by way of digreſſion cutting of that, he toucheth the other, that is, ye right courſe vnto bleſſedneſſe, which is in the true worſhip and feare of God. Our miſeries be many and great, we féele it ſo: here is a holeſome medicine to eaſe and cure▪ vs, if wee take héede and applie it well. There is none of vs ſo dull, but knoweth that f
                     •
                  licitie is in god, he is the fountaine of happines. We haue this alſo engrauen in our mindes, that ſuch only are bleſſed as be in Gods fauor, and therfore he muſt be worſhipped, and his diſpleaſure muſt be appeaſed.
               Theſe pointes Solomon doeth not touch at all, for he néeded not: but how to ſéeke God aright, and to worſhip him as he may accept and be pleaſed, that is the

thing. For when it cōmeth to this, men faile and are fooliſh: they ſéeke him, they worſhip him, faine they would haue his anger appeaſed towards them, and be in his fauour, but they doe it ſo fondly, that they be neuer the better but the worſe. Let vs therfore be taught here by Solomon, how to auoyde ſo intollerable a miſchiefe, which we be all ready is run into.
               
                  Take heede to thy feet (ſaith he) whē thou goeſt to the houſe of God. When thou goeſt to ſéeke God, o
                     •
                   to worſhippe him. For God did appoint a ſpecial place for his worſhip, the Temple in Ieruſalem. There he did ſo rea
                     •
                  ale him ſelfe, that hee was ſaide to dwell in it among his people: it was called his houſe. Here they were to offer gifts &amp; ſacrifices vnto him. This Temple, and all the worſhip in ceremonies which was 
                     〈…〉
                   vnto it are taken away. For they were ordeyned but while Chriſt ſhould come and finiſh our redemption, and therefore he ſaid to the woman at the well, Iohn 4. Woman beléeue me, the hower commeth

and now is, that neither at Ieruſalem, neither in this mountaine ye ſhall worſhip the father. And againe he ſaith, that the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip in ſpirite and truth. God reuealeth himſelfe in all nations of the world, and men are to worſhip him euery where.
               But yet neuertheleſſe theſe words do ſtand ſtill vnto vs. We haue Gods houſe where he is chiefly to be ſought and worſhipped, euen the publike aſſembly. For God hath ordeyned ſhepeheards and teachers to call the flocke together, &amp; to 
                     •
                  éedEpheſ. 4. them, Epheſ. 4. There is ſpeciall promiſe made of a bleſſing in the publike aſſemblies. Where two or thrée are gathered together in my name, there am I in the middeſt of them. Matth. 19. The holyMath. 19. prophete of God did ſtagger when he beheld the proſperitie of the wicked, and the affliction of the iuſt, Pſalm. 73. He couldPſalm. 73. not tell how to be ſatiſfied, vntil he went (as he ſaith) into the ſanctuaries of God, there God reſolued him of his great doubt. We muſt therefore goe to Gods houſe to ſéeke ſuch bleſſings, and to worſhip

and praiſe God together. No man can be a right worſhipper of God in priuate, that doeth not frequent the publike aſſemblies, where God ſpeaketh to his people. We muſt all of vs, if we be wiſe, goe to Gods houſe: but that is not enough, marke what he giueth in precept: take heed to thy feete. This muſt néeds be a borowed ſpéech: for wée may not be ſo ſimple, as to vnderſtand it of the bodily féet. He doeth not ſet downe a charge to will men to looke how they ſtep in the way when they goe to the Church. It is to be vnderſtood of the hart and mind, approaching to ſéeke and worſhip God.
               It is therfore as much as to ſay, when thou wilt ſéeke God &amp; worſhip him, take héed how thy heart and minde do come, for thou mayeſt goe awry. There is a right way, and there is a wrong way: if thou goe in the right way, thou art bleſſed: if thou goe in the wrong way thou doeſt marre all, thou ſhalt kindle Gods wrath againſt thée. Then next he doeth in generall expreſſe which is the right way, and which is the wrong. The one

is in theſe words, draw neare to heare. The other in theſe, rather then to offer the ſacrifice of fooles, for they perceiue not that they do euill. Solomon doeth in a worde ſet downe that which Moſes and the Prophetes doo ſo much and ſo often vrge, namely that the true worſhip of God hath for the ground &amp; foundation, ſincere obedience. Harken to the voice of the Lord thy God in all that he commandeth thée: thou ſhalt walke in his commandements, his ſtatutes, ordinances and lawes. Thou ſhalt adde nothing vnto his word, thou ſhalt take nothing therfro.
               In this place he ſaith, draw neare to hearken: that is to be vnderſtood that we muſt giue eare vnto yt which God ſpeaketh: for there ought to be no voice in Gods houſe but his owne. It is high ſacriledge for any other voice but Gods to be vttered there. And Chriſt ſaith hée is the true ſhéepeheard, his ſhéepe heare his voice, but a ſtranger they will not heare. The true and faithful paſtors, when they preach, vttering nothing but Gods word,

it is not their owne voice, but his. There is one lawe giuer, which is able to ſaue and to deſtroy, wée haue then one ſoueraigne Lord and King, euen the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords: and firſt wée muſt begin with this, to giue eare vnto his voice. We know not how to worſhip him: we may not worſhip him after our owne deuiſes, for of ſuch hée ſaith, they worſhip me in vaine, teaching for doctrines mens precepts, he hath preſcribed fully and perfectly in euery point, how we ſhall worſhip him.
               We are therfore willed to draw neare to heare. For if we faile in this, and will be worſhippers, not regarding to hearken, we faile in the foundation and goe awrie out of the waie in all that we doo. Therefore herein, take heed to thy feet when thou goeſt to Gods houſe: to heare and not to doo, is not worth ought. Be ye doers of the word and not hearers onely, deceiuing your ſelues. Iam. 1. And our ſauiour ſaith, if any heare my words &amp; doo them not, I will liken him to a man that buildeth his houſe vpon the ſande▪
                  
great is the fall of that houſe, Matth. 7.
                  Math. 7. The holy Scripture doth not account it worth the name of hearing, vnles a man be a doer.
               Moreouer, this is to be wel obſerued when he ſaith, drawe neere to hearken, for it teacheth that the true worſhippers muſt haue a readie and chearefull minde to hearken. Loue and reuerence to their God, doeth make them delight in his voyce, and not that onely, but the benefit which we receiue by his worde, he doeth beget vs by it, to be his children, as S. Peter ſaith. We are borne, not of mortall, but of immortall ſéede, the worde of God which indureth for euer. Of his owne good will (ſaith S. Iames) hath hée begotten vs with ye word of trueth: therfore let euery man be ſwift to heare. By hearing the holy word, wee become the ſonnes and daughters of God. If wée be ſwift to heare, and kéepe, happie are we. For our Sauiour ſaith, Bleſſed are they 
                     •
                  hat heare the word of God, and kéepe it. To make this yet more plaine, why wée 
                     •
                  hould drawe nigh to hearken, I will

ſpeake ſome what more of the new birth which is wrought thereby. We are all dy nature the children of wrath, in as much as we be borne in ſinne. All that is in vs is but fleſh, that is to be crucified with the luſts and concupiſcences. This mortification of the fleſh through the ſpirite, is called the putting off the old mā. This is wrought by learning, God hath appointed his worde for to purge vs. All our vncleannes is to be cleanſed away by the pure word. Ignorance, hereſie, errors, darkenes, and vnbeléefe, are expelled by it.
               Then further, there is the true image of God to be ſet vp, which is called the putting on of the new man, which after God is created in righteouſnes and true holines. The bleſſed ſpirite of grace breathing life and all good thinges into our ſoules, doeth it by hearing the word. It is therefore the ſwéete foode of our ſoules, the Preachers are called Shepheards, which féede the Lords flock. We may well ſee there is no comming to ſéek God, and to worſhip him, but this way.

This is the right way, take héede to thy féet for to walke in it, draw néere to harken. Learne by the word of the Lorde how thou mayſt worſhip him aright.
               I will come now to the other parte, which is the worſhippe diſalowed, called the ſacrifice of fooles. In olde time, before the comming of Chriſt, God inſtituted many ceremonies &amp; ſacrifices, which did ſhadow things to come. Theſe was the Church then to be exerciſed in. Not that he eſtéemed the doing of thoſe outward things ſo much, or accounted his worſhip to conſiſt therein: but he regarded the inward faith, and integritie of heart.
               Thoſe outward ordinances were but for helpes to further faith: and true godlines. When they offered ſlayne beaſts in ſacrifice, Chriſt was repreſented, and withall, the offerer did declare his faith and repentance thereby. This was forgotten, or not regarded of many, and ſo they offered their ſacrifices, omitting the chiefe vſe, as though they had doone the Lord a pleaſure. This wee may ſée by

the Pſalm. 50. And many are the complaintsPſal. 50. of the prophets againſt ſuch worſhippers. They neglect the holy doctrine of God, and be ignorant and vnſkilfull in his waies, for which he calleth thē fooles in this place. He doth wiſh men to take héed of it, becauſe theſe fooles doo nothing but ſinne, when they come to worſhip God. Al that they doo is accurſed and abominable, yea euen their praiers &amp; whols worſhip, yet (he ſaith) they doo not perceiue that they doo euill. Their blind deuotiō to ſéeke God ſéemeth to themſelues a goodly ie well, and that is one great part of their follie. Thus we ſée the ſenſe of his wordes.
               Now will I come to apply this doctrine more particularly, that wée may know who they be that erre, &amp; how miſerable their eſtate is. And firſt I will beginne with the church of Rome and all Papiſts. This doctrine doth ouerthrow them, for this beyng true, they can not be the Church of God. There is no drawing néere to hearken to the word of God among them, they haue baniſhed it and

buried it. God ſpeaketh not in their ſynagoges, but the deuiſes of men are ſet vp: therefore all their worſhip is the ſacrifice of fooles. They do ſinne, they be abominable and accurſed in all their doings.
               It is a vaine excuſe when they alledge, wée worſhip none but the true God, we worſhip Chriſt. When ye ſée it plaine that a man may goe to Gods owne houſe where his worde is purely taught, and ſéeks to worſhip the very true God, and yet offer the ſacrifice of fooles, if he giue not eare to be taught in the holy doctrine. How much more then where God ſpeaketh not, but mens abominable inuentions are ſet vp. Let not this ſéeme harde, but marke our Sauiour doth cite out of the prophet Ieſay, Math. 15. This peopleMath. 15. draw néere me with their lippes, and honour me with their mouth, but their hart is farre from mée, in vaine doo they worſhip me, teaching for doctrines mens precepts. There be a thouſand abominatiōs among the Papiſtes, which make their worſhip to be the ſacrifice of fooles, but if

there were no more but this, it doeth ouerthrow them.
               I will come now to a ſecond ſort of men which denie poperie, &amp; yet care not for drawing néere to hearken. They can not away with the preaching (at leaſt wiſe) with the true preaching of Gods word▪ I can not tel what I ſhould terme them, but our land doeth ſwarme full of them in all places. Theſe crie out for praier in Gods houſe. There is (ſay they) ſo much preaching that there is no time for prayer, good praiers are hindred. Yea (ſay theſe) the prayers be better then all their pratling, for ſo it pleaſeth them to terme preaching, by which God ſpeaketh vnto vs.
               In déede prayer is a ſpeciall part of Gods worſhip, but if a man doe not pray aright, though the praier in it ſelfe bée moſt excellent which he vttereth, it is the ſacrifice of a ſoole, it is turned in to ſinne. Lette vs conſider the cauſes. The holy Ghoſt willeth, draw néere to h
                     •
                  arken, when a mā will worſhip God. And great reaſon, God is our ſoueraigne Lord,

whom we are to ſerue. He is our king &amp; lawmaker, whoſe will wée are to obey and none other. He is our ſhéepeheard whoſe voice wée muſt heare and followIohn. 10. him. My ſhéepe heare my voice Iohn. 10. He hath appointed &amp; giuen paſtors andEpheſ. 4. teachers to féede his ſhéepe, Epheſ. 4.
               
               How canſt thou without contempt of Gods maieſtie, yea without rebellion againſt the king, and renoūcing thy ſhepheard, neglect to heare his voice? Thou art a blinde foole, thou art ſo ignorant, that thou dooſt not vnderſtand the Lords prayer. Thou wouldeſt haue God heare thée ſpeaking thou knoweſt not what, &amp; thou wilt not heare what he ſaith. What reaſon is it that God ſhould regard thoſe which regard not him? Reade the firſte Chapter of the Prouerbes, and there yée ſhall ſee how wiſdome complayneth againſt theſe ignorant fooles, and denounceth vengeance, I cried, and ſtretched forth my hand, and yee regarded not, but deſpiſed my counſell, ye ſhal crie when your deſtruction commeth, and I will not heare.
               
               
                  If this doctrine doe ſéeme hard, heareProu. 28. what is written Prouerbs 28. Hee that turneth away his eare from hearing the law, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable. Is not this plaine inough, to ſhe we that God abhorreth the prayers of blind ignorant perſons, which care not for his word? What ſhall we ſay then of perſecuters of Gods word? they muſt néedes be worſe, Our Lord and Sauiour doethMath. 7. call them dogs. Such as doe not regarde the precious and heauenly doctrine, hee doeth liken vnto ſwine which care not for pearles, but tread them in the mire. Such as haue the holy things of God offered them, and doe perſecute the bringers, he compareth to dogs which turne againe and rent them.
               Conſider now beloued, how woful is the ſtate of all theſe? The men which do not hearken to Gods voyce, but to ſuperſtitio
                     •
                  s inuentiōs, thoſe that deſpiſe and ſet light by the preaching of the word, or heare, and doe not obey it: ſuch alſo as bée perſecuters of the ſame, all their praiers are turned into ſinne, they offer the ſacrifice

of fooles, God doth abhorre them, and all their doings. Deſtruction and miſerie come vpon them, they crie vnto God but he doeth not heare them, they be neuer the better: yea, they doe increaſe their ſin by praying. For (as he ſaith here) they doe euill.
               I know it will be here replied, that the Scripture doeth promiſe, that he which calleth vpon God ſhalbe heard, and at what time ſoeuer a ſinner doeth repents him of his ſinne, all his wickednes ſhall be done away. This muſt néeds be true, but yet wee muſt vnderſtande, that the prayer and repentance which are allowed before God, procéed from faith, which is Gods gifte, the work of the holy ghoſt, and not in a mans owne power. WhatſoeuerRom. 14. is not of faith is ſinne, Rom 14. which is all one with that which our ſauiour doeth teach Iohn 15. Where heeIohn. 15. compareth himſelfe to the true vine, and the faithfull to the branches. The brāch can bring foorth no fruite except it abide in the vine, no more can we do any thing except we abide in Chriſt. All that is of

our ſelues is corrupt, yea euen prayers. Nothing pleaſeth God but that which procéedeth from ye ſpirit of Chriſt, which thoſe only haue that are graffed into him by faith. And this is by the worde, as he ſaith in the ſame place, if ye abide in me, and my word abide in you, aſke what ye will, and it ſhall be done vnto you.
               Wherefore brethren, receiue this inſtruction of Solomon, Take heede to thy feet when thou goeſt to Gods houſe, &amp; drawe neere to hearken, rather then to offer the ſacrifice of fooles. Bow down with reuerence, with feare &amp; trembling, to heare the voyce of your God, and to know and obey his will: then crie, &amp; he will he are you, your prayer ſhal come vp before him as ſwéete incenſe. Otherwiſe yée ſhall be but fooles. Let vs procéede to that which followeth. Be not raſh with thy mouth, neither let thy hart make haſt to vtter a thing before God: for God is in heauen and thou art vpon earth, and therfore let thy words be few. The former verſe did giue vs inſtructiō, that in ſéeking to worſhip God, we muſt

giue eare and hearken to his voice.
               Now in this he giueth rules how we are to ſpeake vnto him. For in Gods houſe, the Lord God ſpeaketh vnto vs, &amp; againe we ſpeake vnto him. He ſpeaketh when the faithfull ſhéepheards doo declare his word. We ſpeake in prayer, in thankeſgiuing, in making promiſes &amp; vowes. Looke what he ſpeaketh it is to be accepted, becauſe he is moſt holy, and nothing can come from him but that which is pure and good. Cōtrariwiſe we be corrupt, and all that we ſpeake is fooliſh and vile, vnleſſe it be ordered by his holy ſpirit. Therfore we muſt be taught of him how to ſpeake: we may not come at aduenture before the Lord to ſpeake vnto him, for he is a great king, and wée are poore and baſe wormes. He is full of glory, power, and heauenly maieſtie, we are duſt &amp; aſhes. We ought to conſider therefore into whoſe preſence we come, and vnto whom we ſpeake: and this is it which he ſaith, God is in heauen, and thou art vpon the earth.
               
               Our Sauiour▪ preſcribing vnto vs a

forme of prayer, leadeth vs vnto ye ſame, when he willeth vs to ſay, Our Father, which art in heauen. The neceſſitie of this precept is to bee eſtéemed from our diſpoſition, how rude, how vnreuerent, &amp; how vnmannerly our hearts be, when we ſpeake to the Lord. We dore not in ſuch ſort ſpeake vnto an earthly prince, no no
                     •
                   to a man of meane worſhip. But to auoide this rudenes, and to come with due reuerence, yea euen with feare and trembling▪ before ſo high a Maieſtie, hée willeth each man not to be raſh with his mouth, nor to let his heart make haſte to vtter a thing before God, where reuerence is ſet a part of him to whō he ſpeaketh, a man dooth haſtely and raſhly babble whatſoeuer commeth into his mind. But when he doth carrie great reuerēce, hee doeth not ſpeake but with feare and trēbling, aduiſedly waying whatſoeuer he doeth vtter. When we come to ſpeake vnto ye God of glory, how wicked a thing is it to come vnreuerently, and yet men doe it, and as boldly as it were to come before the meaneſt man vpō earth. Nay

there is no man would take it well, but thinke he were mocked and deſpiſed as a foole, if men ſhould ſpeake ſo vnto him, as they do vnto God. It is true that there be ſome outward ſignes of reuerence, as knéeling or vowing, which is méete, but God doth looke vpon the hart. They babble and vtter wordes with their mouth which they vnderſtand not, or ſpeaking them, their mind is vpon other matters. This is a foule contempt of Gods maieſtie, a ſinne which ſhall be puniſhed with the vengeance of eternall 
                     •
                  re. He that is raſh with his mouth, &amp; doeth let his hart make haſt to ſpeake vnto God, doeth not reuerence his glorious maieſtie: and yet ye ſée how ſuch blind &amp; groſſe hypocrites doo glory in their vaine babbling, euen when they know not what they ſay.
               Let vs cōſider beloued how to eſchew this euill; how ſhall a man frame himſelfe, that he may not vnaduiſedly &amp; raſhly ſpeake vnto God, but with reuerence which is due, yea with feare &amp; trembling? I will ſhew ye. Firſt conſider déepely, of that he ſaith, God is in heauen. Conſider

I ſay what a great and glorious God hee is. His maieſtie and power are aboue the heauens. He is iuſt, holy and good, a hater of all iniquitie and vncleanneſſe: the fountaine and giuer of all good things: louing to the faithfull, and a moſt terrible God to the wicked. Then looke vpon thy ſelfe, remember that he ſaith here, thou art vpon earth. Thou art weake, baſe, ſinfull and miſerable. What art thou to come before him? how wilt thou ſpeake vnto him? wherein ſhalt thou be regarded? conſider thine vnworthineſſe, caſt downe thy ſelfe in humilitie, with ye ſenſe and féeling of thy ſins and beggerlineſſe. Looke what he doeth promiſe to giue, craue it earneſtly with ſtedfaſt faith, and with a groning ſpirite. Not thus when they come to ſpeake vnto God, are raſhe &amp; fooliſh, they imagine that the very babling of words is a ſeruice of God, and as the blind Papiſtes thought, if a man did one day ſay more then his ordinarie ſtint, God was in his debte: and wée ſée how the fooliſh pardons are granted from the biſhop of Rome, with condition that a

man ſhall ſay ouer ſeuen or ten Aue Maries, and ſo many Pater noſters.
               
               
                  Solomon giueth warning to beware of this: Be not raſh with thy mouth, neither let thy heart make haſt to vtter a thing before God. To performe this there is néede of déepe meditation before a man pray: the vnſkilfull and vntaught in Gods holy word, can not meditate any thing but corruptly, and after the rotten braine of fleſh and bloud in vaine imagination, and therefore they can not pray aright: they caſt forth their words and deſires vnaduiſedly, they come rudely before God, becauſe they know not him nor yet themſelues. By his heauenly word, the Lord doth reueale himſelfe vnto vs, by the knowledge and light thereof we behold his glory, we are caried vnto a wonderment and admiration of his excellencie, we reuerence him, we tremble before him. As by the worde we behold God, that in him is life and all good things, ſo by the ſame wée ſée and know our ſelues, that we be very corruption &amp; miſerie: we be poore, naked, and void of

all good things. He is the bottomles fountaine of holines, life and ioy: if we will haue ought, we muſt draw it from him.
               This may lead vs to humilitie, to hunger &amp; thirſt for his heauenly gifts: hunger and thirſt be ſuch things as no man can endure, but will ſpéedily crie out for reliefe. The hungrie and thirſtie ſoule doth make as great haſt vnto God, and doth vehemently crie out to be refreſhed: ſuch doth God call for, ſuch onely doth he heare, all other doo not pray, but babble. The prophet Ieſay chapt. 55. doth in theIeſay. 55. name of the Lord proclaime, Come to the waters all that be a thirſt. The bleſſed virgin in her ſong, ſaith, that he filleth the hungrie with good things, and the rich he ſendeth away emptie. Thoſe be called rich which féele not their miſerie. And Chriſt ſaith, Come vnto mée all yée that trauaile and be heauy laden, and I will refreſh ye, Math. 11. Againe by the wordMath. 11. of the Lord, we ſée what he hath promiſed vs. For we muſt aſke according to his will, and not after our owne fantaſies &amp; deſtres: we muſt alſo aſke in faith &amp; not

wauer, or elſe we ſhall receiue nothing, Iam. 1. Which can not be but where weIam. 1. haue his promiſe: wée muſt giue him thankes and praiſe with vnfained harts.
               All this is to be done as he willeth in fewe words, for it followeth after he had ſaid, God is in heauen and thou art vpon the earth, therfore let thy words be few. The faithful ſoule doth crie continuallie vnto God: for being in continuall néede, it watcheth vnto prayer. But yet the words are fewe. On the other ſide, the blinde and fooliſh, as our Sauiour ſheweth Mat. 6. vſe many words, much babbling,Math. 6. and vaine repetitions, for which they thinke to be heard. They wiſh and deſire euen as their blinde fantaſie doeth leade them: they ſpeake they knowe not what, they multiplie words vpō words, babbling vpon babbling, ſuppoſing that they do a great good thing to pleaſe God. We are warned ye ſée, to take héede of ſuch raſhnes.
               What are now all the prayers, the vowes and thanks geuing of the Popiſh Church? What is all the babbling of

long prayers, either publike or priuate, where the word of the Lorde is not opened to the people? Can they haue thoſe former things which I noted? Is it poſſible that they ſhould not be raſh in ſpeaking vnto God? They think if they haue tumbled ouer their ſtinte and full number of prayers, all is well, they laye on tongue, they cannot tell what, neither doo they much care, their heart is blind and wicked. When they haue caſt behinde their backes the word of the Lord, &amp; haue filled themſelues with luſtes and vayne pleaſures, forgetting God, yet they muſt for faſhion ſake, haue halfe an hower to 
                     •
                  umble ouer a ſort of prayers, when the heart is drowned in ſecuritie.
               Theſe be fooles, yea theſe bewray thē
                  ſelues to be fooles, for he ſaith, that like as a dreame commeth foorth by the multitude of buſines, ſo the voice of a foole by the multitude of words. Looke how a mans minde which is earneſtly buſied in the day time, doeth dreame of it in the night▪ and ſo out of the multitude of buſines the dreame doeth diſcloſe it ſelfe, euen

ſo by many words the voice of a foole is bewrayed. We doe account thē fooles which are full of words, and prattle vnaduiſedly of euery matter: and what reaſon is it that we ſhould not, as it is here ſaid, take them to be fooles which doe ſo vnto God? What ſhall we ſay then of al the popiſh worſhip, and of the Papiſtes which do bable many words which they do not vnderſtand? what ſhall we thinke of thoſe alſo which wil haue praier with ſo many words, &amp; ſo many turnings in &amp; out in the publike aſſembly, when thou voweſt a vow to God, &amp;c. This is another part of Gods worſhip, about which he doeth inſtruct. We ſpeake to God in praier, &amp; in thankeſgiuing: ſo do we alſo in vowing vowes: for we make a ſolēne promiſe to God either to doo ſome good thing, or elſe to forſake ſome euill.
               In old time ſome of the kings of Iuda did cauſe the people to ſweare, that they would ſerue the Lord &amp; cleane vnto him, and renounce the worſhip of idols. Holy men of God in their afflictions did vow and promiſe to God, that when he ſhould

deliuer them, they would openly declare his praiſe. We haue in baptiſme vowed to conſecrate our ſelues, euen our ſoules &amp; our bodies to God, by renouncing the diuell, the world, and the fleſh. If we goe backe from this our vowe, how can we come rightly to Gods table? for there we doe alſo renew the ſame: wée bind our ſelues with promiſes vnto God. There be alſo particuler vowes &amp; promiſes, as euery man hath cauſe. If we féele our ſelues ſlacke vnto good duties, we are to ſtirre vp our ſelues, &amp; to bind our ſelues by ſome earneſt promiſe to God. If we be inclined to any vice, we are to doo the like When we be in diſtres &amp; ſéeke helpe at Gods hands, we promiſe vpon our deliuerance to be thankefull and obedient. We muſt take héed in al theſe that we be not raſh with our mouth, nor let our hart make haſt to vtter a promiſe. We muſt be well aduiſed what we ſweare &amp; promiſe to God. What a fault is it accoūted in ſuch as will promiſe much vnto men, &amp; performe little? do not all deſpiſe ſuch perſons? the fault is much greater when

there is promiſe made vnto God and not performed. He willeth therefore that he which hath vowed be not flacke to performe his vow: they be vaine fooles which make promiſe and pay it not: &amp; God is not delighted in fooles, God is delighted in his true worſhippers.
               Vow therefore and performe. For he ſaith, it is better not to vow, then to vow and not to performe: we are to vow vnto God, and therefore it is euill not to vow: but it is a greater euill to vow, &amp; not to doo that we haue vowed. Men are raſh &amp; afterward doo repent, then ſéeke they to excuſe the matter that they did ignorantly: but this will not ſerue, for he ſaith, Suffer not thy mouth to cauſe thy fleſh to ſinne, and ſay not before the Angell that it is an errour: why ſhould God be angrie at thy voice &amp; deſtroy the worke of thy handes. He that raſhly maketh vowes to God, may very well be ſaid to ſuffer his mouth to cauſe his fleſh to ſin, that is himſelfe, a part being put for the whole. As often on the contrary, the ſcripture doth vſe to put ye ſoule for the whole

man. There is no excuſe before the Lord Chriſt, who is the Angel he here ſpeaketh of, when he ſaith, ſay not before the Angel it was an error, for he is called the Angel of the couenant, Malach. 3. MakeMalach. 3 what excuſe thou canſt to excuſe thy raſhnes, yet Gods wrath ſhal be kindled againſt thée, he will plague &amp; puniſh thée: he will (as it is here ſaid) deſtroy the worke of thy hands.
               
               It is a lamentable caſe, why wilt thou caſt thy ſelfe into it? againe he vſeth a cō
                  pariſon: In the multitude of dreames (ſaith he) there be vanities, ſo in the multitude of words. Wee ſée he likeneth thoſe fooliſh vowes made to God, vnto dreams, which are but vanitie, but feare thou God. Know thou well vnto whom thou ſpeakeſt, and be wel aduiſed, &amp; kéepe thy promiſe. Thus we ſée briefly what is to be obſerued in our vowes which wée make vnto God. Let vs conſider in ſome particulers who breake theſe rules.
               And firſt for our generall vow in baptiſme, we haue promiſed to conſecrate both our ſoules and bodies to the ſeruice

of God in true holineſſe, by renouncing the deuill and all ſinfull luſtes. Then all ſuch as deſpiſe Gods truth and walke in darkeneſſe after the fleſh, haue beſides al other there ſins, this great burthen vpon them, that they be vowbreakers, they haue broken their faith, &amp; promiſe made vnto God. It had béene better for them neuer to haue vowed, then thus to deale, they be in a bad caſe.
               Secondly thoſe offend (as we ſée it vſually come to paſſe) which in great affliction make promiſe if God deliuer thē they will glorifie him, but are falſe. For God doeth will vs, Pſal. 50. Call vpō mePſal. 50. in the day of affliction, I will deliuer thée, and thou ſhalt glorifie me. When a man hath lewdly ſpent his time, in riot, in drunkennes, in wantonnes, in enuie, hatred, and malice. If God ſtrike him with gréeuous ſicknes, that his bones ſéeme to rattle in his ſkinne, and that hée feareth death, then doth he tremble, then doeth he deſire that God wil haue mercy vpon him, and then doth he make vowes and promiſes: If God doe reſtore me to

health againe, and geue mee life, I will neuer be the man I haue béene. I haue liued a naughtie life, I haue diſhonoured God, I haue deſpiſed his worde, I will harken to his voice, &amp; leaue my naughty vices, and liue to Gods glorie. How wel were this, if men did as they ſay. But marke, and ye ſhall finde the moſt part
                     •
                   ſo ſoone as euer they be recouered, &amp; can but crawle out, fall againe to their former wayes, and be as euill, or worſe thē euer they were before. What ſhall wee ſay of theſe men, are they not gréeuous offenders? I haue obſerued ſome very wicked liuers: God hath ſtricken them, and terrified them, ſo that with teares they haue confeſſed their vngodly behauiour. They haue promiſed and vowed, if God would reſtore them, to become new men. They haue recouered, and become as vile in ſinne as before. God hath ſtricken them againe, and they haue died in fury and rage, without any apparance of grace, or remorſe. Doth not this ſhew that Gods wrath is heauie againſt ſuch faithleſſe vow breakers?
               
                  Let men (as he ſaith) feare God. Let them take héede how they dallie wt him, for ſure God will deſtroy ſuch, and al the worke of their handes.
               Moreouer whē he ſaith pay that thou voweſt, hee condemneth all thoſe raſhe vowes which are not agréeable to ye rule of Gods word, which be not to his glory, or that be not in our power. For ſuch vowes are not to be performed. King He rod promiſed with an oath to the daughter of Herodias, yt he would geue whatſoeuer ſhe ſhould aſke, to the halfe of his kingdome. She aſked the head of Iohn the Baptiſt, it had béene much better for him to haue repented of his raſh oath, &amp; not haue performed it, then to ſhedde the innocent bloud of ſo great a ſeruant of God. Iephtha vowed when hee went to warre, that if the Lord ſhould geue him victorie, at his returne that which ſhould firſt come out at his dores to méete him, ſhould be the Lords, or els he would offer it for a burnt offering. Meaning, that if it were ſuch as might be offered in ſacrifice, it ſhould: if not, it ſhould be conſecrate

to the Lord. What warrant had he to make ſuch a vowe? how ſhould it be to Gods glorie? He was puniſhed, for his daughter (being his onely child) firſt met him, and though it were gréeuous, he did with her as he had vowed: ſhe was let go a time to bewayle her virginitie, &amp; then put a parte to the Lorde, and reſtrayned from mariage, for ſo they thought it muſt be, and it is ſaid ſhe knew no man: and by a decrée the daughters of Iſrael went yere by yere, foure dayes in the yere, to talke with the daughter of Iephtha: for it is too hard to charge a faithfull man wt ſlaying his daughter in ſacrifice. Many haue béene deceiued in ſo thinking, the Church of Rome wil haue men and women vow virginitie. Our Sauiour ſaith all men are not able to doe ſo, to liue vnmarried, but thoſe to whom it is geuen. To the ſame effect teacheth Saint Paul, 1. Cor. 7. They againe replie and ſay, let1. Cor. 7. a man aſke, and he ſhall receiue.
               But this is true againſt them, that he which receiueth that he doeth aſke, aſketh that which God hath promiſed to

geue him: or els, if hee take vpon him yt which God doeth not promiſe to make him able to performe, he may aſke, &amp; not receiue, for he tempteth God, and committeth a gréeuous ſinne. And we may ſée by lamentable experience, how God hath puniſhed ſuch raſh vowes: when the ſtink of that horrible filthines which was committed euery where by monks, friers, nunnes, &amp; prieſtes, is not yet out of our noſes. All ſuch vowes are abhominable. Vow according to Gods holie wil, to his glory and praiſe, in yt which he hath promiſed to inhable vs by his grace to performe, and pay it.
               It is a ſinne not to vow ſuch things: it is a greater ſinne, to vowe and not to performe them. I will here end, not entring into that ſea of fooliſh, raſh, and vndiſcrete vowes, which vpon euery occaſion both men and women doo take vpon thē, not conſidering to whom they ſpeak. God of his mercy open our eyes, &amp; kéepe vs frō this raſh dealing with him.
               Amen.
            
            FINIS.
