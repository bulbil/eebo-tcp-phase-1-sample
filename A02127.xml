            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            As it was plaid by her Maieſties ſeruants.

            THE HONOVRABLE Hiſtorie of Frier Bacon.
            Enter, Edward the firſt malcontented with Lacy earle of Lincolne, Iohn Warren earle of Suſſex, and Ermsbie gentleman: Raph Simnell the kings foole.
            
               Lacie.
               
                  WHY lookes my lord like to a troubled skie,
               When heauens bright ſhine, is ſhadowed with a fogge:
               A late we ran the deere and through the Lawndes
               Stript with our nagges the loftie frolicke bucks,
               That ſcudded fore the teiſers like the wind,
               Nere was the Deere of merry Freſingfield,
               So luſtily puld down by iolly mates,
               Nor ſharde the Farmers ſuch fat veniſon,
               So franckly dealt this hundred yeares before:
               Nor haue I ſeene my lord more frolicke in the chace,
               And now changde to a melancholie dumpe.
            
            
               Warren.
               After the Prince got to the keepers lodge
               And had been iocand in the houſe a while:
               Toſsing of ale and milke in countrie cannes,
               Whether it was the countries ſweete content:
               Or els the bonny damſell fild vs drinke
               That ſeemd ſo ſtately in her ſtammell red:
               Or that a qualme did croſſe his ſtomacke then,
               But ſtraight he fell into his paſsions.
            
            
               Ermsbie.
               Sirra Raphe, what ſay you to your maiſter,

               Raphe.
               Heereſt thou Ned, nay looke if hee will ſpeake to me.
            
            
               Edward.

               And what of this?
            
            
               Raphe.
               Why ſo thou ſhalt beguile Loue, for Loue is ſuch a proud ſcab, that he will neuer meddle with fooles nor children, Is not Raphes counſell good Ned.
            
            
               Edward.

               Seeing you come as friends vnto the frier
               Reſolue you doctors, Bacon can by bookes,
               Make ſtorming Boreas thunder from his caue,

               Why, thinks king Henries ſonne that Margrets loue,
               Hangs in the vncertaine ballance of proud time,
               That death ſhall make a diſcord of our thonghts,

               Europes rich wealth nor Englands monarchie,
               Should not allure Lacie to ouerliue,

               Margret.
               Rid me, and keepe a friend worth many loues.

               Truſt me Plantagenet theſe Oxford ſchooles

               The mountaines full of fat and fallow deere,

               The towne gorgeous with high built colledges,
               And ſchollers ſeemely in their graue attire.

                  ,
               As Hermes, Melchie, and Pithagoras,
               Affirme that mongſt the quadruplicitie
               Of elementall eſſence, Terra is but thought,
               To be a punctum ſquared to the reſt:
               And that the compaſſe of aſcending eliments
               Exceed in bigneſſe as they doe in height.
               Iudging the concaue circle of the ſonne,
               To hold the reſt in his circomference,
               If then as Hermes ſaies the fire be greatſt,
               Pureſt and onely giueth ſhapes to ſpirites:
               Then muſt theſe Demones that haunt that place

               Bungay.
               I reaſon not of elementall ſhapes,
               Nor tell I of the concaue lattitudes,
               Noting their eſſence nor their qualitie,
               But of the ſpirites that Piromancie calles,
               And of the vigourof the Geomanticke fiends,
               I tell thee Germane magicke haunts the grounds,
               And thoſe ſtrange necromantick ſpels
               That worke ſuch ſhewes and wondering in the world,
               Are acted by thoſe Geomanticke ſpirites,
               That Hermes calleth Terraefilii.
               
               The fierie ſpirits are but transparant ſhades,
               That lightly paſſe as Heralts to beare newes,
               But earthly fiends cloſd in the loweſt deepe,
               Diſſeuer mountaines if they be but chargd,
               Being more groſe and maſsie in their power.
            
            
               Vander.
               Rather theſe earthly geomantike ſpirits,
               Are dull and like the place where they remaine:
               For when proud Lucipher fell from the heauens,
               The ſpirites and angels that did ſin with him,
               Retaind their locall eſſence as their faults,
               
                  
All ſubiect vnder Lunas continent,
               They which offended leſſe hang in the fire,
               And ſecond faults did reſt within the aire,
               But Lucifer and his proud hearted fiends,
               Were throwne into the center of the earth,
               Hauing leſſe vnderſtanding than the reſt,
               As hauing greater ſinne, and leſſer grace.
               Therfore ſuch groſſe and earthly ſpirits doe ſerue,
               For Iuglers, Witches, and vild ſorcerers,
               Whereas the Piromanticke gemij,
               Are mightie, ſwift, and of farre reaching power,
               But graunt that Geomancie hath moſt force,
               Bungay to pleaſe theſe mightie potentates,
