            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                  To us, of your exployts, and acts,

                  I tell you, Sauce, I ſcorne to flout,
                  But thou ſhal't find mee true, and ſtout;
                  Before K. James, I James his name-ſake fought
                  Oth' Scaffold;
               
               
                  For when the great Mogul came o're,
                  And challeng'd all on England's ſhore,
                  My Country's Credit had for evermore
                  Bin undone;
               
               
                  Had I not entertayn'd him there,
                  At ſharp, before both Prince, and Peere,
                  And ſent him home-ward with a flea in's eare
                  From London.
                  
               
               
                  When I did ſerve great Buckingham,
                  
                  A lozell raſcall at mee came,
                  With his long forke, &amp; layd on with the ſame
                  Devoutly;
               
               
                  But I, that never knew diſmay,
                  Drew my ſhort blade, and ſpoil'd his play,
                  Struck up his heeles, and took his tooles away
                  Moſt ſtoutly;
               
               
                  
                  The Dukes acquaintance then I grew,
                  Who ever ſince that time me knew.
                  You cannot chuſe but know this to be true:
                  'Tis voyc't ſo
               
               
                  A great reward to mee hee gave,

                  And when to Scotland Charles our King,
                  On progreſſe went, but for one thing,

                  To give Iames honour, ſince with Hailes,
                  
                  I plaid that prize (tis knowne theſe are no tales
                  I tell yee)
               
               
                  For while the Varlet made much chat,
                  That he could doe, I know not what,
                  I made his heeles to mount; and laid him flat
                  On's Belly;
               
               
                  Yet fairely then I let him riſe,
                  To feaſt Spectators, with a prize
                  Of Iames-es playing. At me hot he flies,

                  Then I, for all his pelting rage,
                  Did quickly turne him off the Stage;
                  
                     Iames ha's the day, cry'd all the equipage
                  Oth' Scaffold;
               
               
                  
                  Hundreds came in mee to embrace:
                  And happy hee could have the grace
                  To get a look from conquering Jame-es face,
                  To talk on:
               
               
                  And as I went along the ſtreet,
                  The boyes were ready mee to meet,
                  And ſtrow greene ruſhes underneath my feet
                  To walk on.
               
               
                  
                     Gaites,
                     One of the Guard; as Iames reporteth. at New-market Court did dare
                  To ſtrike brave James a box o'th eare:
                  But I ſoone put him in a Panick feare
                  For's errour;
               
               
                  Like Hercules that Gyant fell,
                  When he drew Cerb'rus out of Hell,
                  I drag'd him roaring from his lurking cell,
                  In terrour;
               
               
                  For downe the ſtayres I ſtraight did pull,
                  Spite of his noſe, the ſawcy Gull,
                  The while he cry'd, and bellow'd like a Bull,
                  For pardon.
               
               
                  Toth' Preſence-Chamber then the ſlave
                  I brought: There pitty he to crave
                  Fell downe on's knees; while I ſtood like a grave
                  Church-warden;
               
               
                  
                  And whilſt my breaſt wth wrath was fill'd;
                  For halfe an how'r, and more he kneel'd
                  To me; beſeeching I would pleaſe to yield
                  Some mercy:
               
               
                  My Lords, for him did interceed;
                  That I would pardon his bold deed;
                  (Sure his long kneeling on his joynts did breed
                  The farcy)
               
               
                  Yet I a Challenge him did write,
                  If hee with mee could dare to fight,
                  To meet mee at theA long dry trench on New-market heath. Devill's ditch; but try't
                  He would not.
               
               
                  For knowne it was, the Court about,
                  I had fou'r mighty Duels fought;
                  That with a whole skin come off ſafe; hee thought
                  He could not.
               
               
                  This Wife I have, and the other too,
                  When they my valour once did know,

                  A Field there is; wherein doth ſtand
                  A Caſtle, now lack-daw'd; not man'd;
                  And ſoothly never by a humane hand
                  Erected;
               
               
                  For old King Coël (tales do tell)
                  When firſt he built that Warlike Cell,
                  Conſulted with the ſmoaky Pow'rs of Hell
                  Collected:
               
               
                  This King was tall;At Colcheſter in the High ſtreet hee is ſet forth in a ſmall volume, or Epitome, to ſave exceſsive expence of tymber; or becauſe dwarf Coēl is ſtrong enough to guard a Pump. Gygantick vaſt,
                  His foot was of the largeſt laſt;
                  'Tis everlaſting; I have ſumm'd, and caſt
                  The meaſure;
               
               
                  A Yard in Longitude, no more,

                  His Leg was correſpondent. Some
                  Affirme, his Boots did hold a Coome:
                  This King in ſuch a deale of Leathern roome
                  Did trample.

                  Nor did the Leather to his Conſcience ſtretch
                  So ample;
               
               
                  A many rumors old, and new,
                  And, I think, more believ'd, than true,
                  Are blaz'd abroad of this great King. Did you

                  Like Hawk, or Buzzard at his game,
                  This King could fly in th'ayre (ſayes fame)
                  
                     James will not only juſtifie the ſame,
                  
                     Furthermore he will tell you of a man in this Towne of 105 yeares old, who heard King Coël cry Dad Dad in his mothers belly. But ſweare it;
               
               
                  Whither hee flew in th'ayre, or no,
                  I'm ſure he dived very low
                  Into the earth, how deep no man doth know;

                  Yet this may be concluded, by
                  His fabrigs deep ground-work; if fly
                  He could not; yet at leaſt he very high
                  Aſpired:

                  To play the Cater; and convey
                  For all his Souldiers food enough, e're they
                  Did want it;

                  OfWhich they brought underground from Colcheſter.
                      victuals brought, that they threw ore

               Encourtainiz'd in Stygian ſhade of Night,

               For that deſires, and you deſerve the ſame;
               For which my Muſe heere proſtrite, you doth woo
               To bee, as Subject, ſo Protector too;
               Erave Pentathletick Royſter; daigne to take
               This into favour for your honour's ſake;

               More Amphitheatrall then piles of wood;
               O doe not fire it in your angry mood.
               Behold the verſe, though number'd odd, and rough,
               Yet, meaſur'd even, ſmoothly apt for you:
               The feet your fingers fit, and may be ſcann'd
               With Bidexteritie of either hand.
               Two Tetradactyles mournfull numbers fit
               That hand, whoſe finger by the Beares was bit.
               The Pentaedactyle for your left, more high
               To ſing your deedes, doth mount Heroickly.
               The ſhort dwrafe-verſe to ſcan if't be thy pleaſure,
               Then thump upon thy Stump, and there's the meaſure.

               To you our Muſe ſhall with her Booke be bound.

direct me in framing your anſwer. By reading it I am
ſuddenly tranſ-formed, and become a Rythmicall Proctor.
Whereof I give you a Proofe: which, when I
plead your Apology, ſhall ſerve for a Preface; in

               Not that he did with Hector fight:
               But that he did on Homer's trumpet light

               Nor had theſe fuming feates of Fame,
               Blowne up ſo high ſtout Iockie's name,
               Had Gower's Lime-hound noſe not beene in frame
               To ſmell them.
            
            
               The fivefold fights, which chanted came
               Through Pindar's quill, to this are lame:
               All Greece of ſuch a brave Olympick game
               Ne're craked.

               Yet meanes he not to make a Schoole-booke of it:
               For that would turne to our, and his ſmall profit.
               Our Dames of Heningham would chide, and ſay
               That boyes are ſent to ſtudy not to play.

               And is not that a good token?

               Then meet him at Fence,
