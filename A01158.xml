            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               Courteous Reader,
            
            
               HIstory hath been from all Antiquity as Noble as Notable, and as full of Pleasure as Profit. Poetry I must confesse to be the elder Sister of the two, and the first reducer of

Mankinde to Humanity and Civility: But what the Elder hath delivered unto us Fabulously, the other hath done faithfully.
            Great is the Vtility which redounds to all men by History (of what function or quality soever:) First, to Princes, it is a modell, by which to paterne their Lives and Actions: And by reading the Heroicall deeds of others, to make their presidents, as well by

imitating their Vertues, as avoyding their Vices. To States-men how to establish politicke Lawes, and gravely to manage the Affaires of a flourishing CommonWeale. It instructs Soveraignes, how to governe with Justice, mixt with Lenity, and Subjects to obey with duty, tempered with loyalty.
            Historiographers have in all Times and Ages, and amongst all Nations and

Languages bin held in great reputation and reverence. Amongst the Hebrewes Philo-Judeus, and Josephus Bengorion, who flourisht in the time of Hierusalems last subversion, and depopulation, &amp;c. Amongst the Grecians Herodotus, Thucidides, &amp;c. Amongst the Romans or Latins, Titus Livius, Cornelius Tacitus, Salust, Iustine, &amp;c. Amongst the French, Philip Comines: The Author of the

               French Inventory, the Composer of this Epitome of Chronicle, &amp;c. Of the Scotch, Hector Boetius, Georgius Buconanus, &amp;c. And of our English (to omit many) Holynshed, Fabian, Speed, Mr. Samuel Daniel, &amp;c.
            
            But concerning the present Argument now in agitation, I have reade of one Spintherus Tarentinus, a man (for his knowne VVisedome) by the unanimous

voyce of Greece, adding an Eight to the Seven Sages, who when he was to deliver his Opinion of Epaminondas, prime Captaine of absolute power, and command without limit; after he had studied io honour him with his best Expression, he uttered of him onely these few Words: Hee was a man who knew much, and spake little. The like I may say of the Author of this present VVorke, who

writ it first in the French Language: who though hee were frequent in all the French Annalls, having read all their Voluminous remembrances at large, yet was so farre from troubling the Purse, or tyring the Patience of the Reader, that in his succinctnesse of stile, &amp; contractednesse of Circumstance, he hath strived to spare both: Imitating the old Adage, Frustra fit per plura, quod fieri
               
               potest per pauciora: and my selfe who am the unworthiest of many in this Kingdom, for the Translation of this Worke, have undertaken to make the French History, which I found accidentally, to speake English: where, in the ensuing Booke thou shalt finde such mixture of Discourses, both observeable, delightfull, and worthy to bee had in memory, containing al the Kings that ever were of France, which in number are

sixty foure, with their Conditions, Natures, chiefest Acts, and Deaths, as also of theseverall places of their Jnterment, with many of their accute and witty sayings: all which, noble and Courteous Reader, I present unto thee, with a Table of all the Kings names at the latter end of the Book: and if thou pleasest to accept of my endeavours, and but cast a benigne smile and a gentle censure, I shall take it a double

courtesie, and labour to amend what hath beene done amisse. But least in commending the Brevity used in his Discourse, I might (on the contrary) erre in the prolixity of my Epistle, I thus (though abruptly) as commit thee, so commend thee to thy gentle Interpretation:

                  THE French Nation inhabiting the lower Germany long time before the Reigne of the Valentinians,
                  
Emperours of Rome, whether they were Originaries there, or Forraigners, they according to the report of Aymoynus, Ado, and other Historians, had for an intervall of time ceased to be governed by Kings, being contented to be ruled by Dukes, untill such time that they had a desire to returne to their manner and custome, being incited thereto by the example of other Nations; in so much that upon a mature deliberation, they concluded their Election upon Pharamond for their King, by reason that over and above the vertues resplendent in him, he was the last Sonne of their latest Duke Marcomire, who was Duke of Franconia, or East France, whom Stilico had confined as an Exulant in Tuscany, from the yeare of our Lord 395.
               The time of his Election hath not beene precisely recorded by any Historians; the Moderne Authors also agree not upon the certainty and number of the yeares of his Reigne: For some

                  German Chronicles accompt but 7, others 9, Onuphrius 14, but almost all the French Annalists following Sigebert, agree upon 10. or 12. yeares, which they begin at the yeare of Grace, 419, or 420.
               The French-men then estated him in the Castle of Dispargun, which was, according to Gregory, in Tongry or Turingia, on that side the Rhine, where hee made his residence, or rather in Germany, without an intent of enlarging his command any farther, studying onely to institute and found the Kingdome with good policy, and the Lawes called Ripuary and Salique, by reason the French inhabiting for the most part upon the River of Sals, (which disgorgeth it selfe into the Mein, a great and famous River of Germany) were called Salians, and their principall City Selgestadt, which peradventure might seeme to derive its nomination from Salagast, who was a chiefe Founder thereof. Pharamond lastly comming to

the period of his life, left the succession to his Son Clodion, Anno Domini 430. His Character of life is drawne in these Lineaments; he made good Lawes, and conformed the French to the obedience of civill government; revived the Salique Lawes, and was the Founder of the French Monarchy: his Name Waramond or Pharamond, imported a true mouth, Truth being a noble vertue in a Prince. The Church was then happy in those Lights of Religion, Jerome, Chrysostome, Ambrose, and Augustine, shining through the Clouds of Oppression, wherewith those times were darkned and obscured: And the Papacy was then but weake in power, afterward growing strong by the Emperors absence, warring against the Barbarians, and by succouring afflicted Christians.
            
            
               
               
                  Cloion, or Clodion, the second King of France, Anno 432.
               
                  portrait
               
               
                  
                     CLoion, or Clodion, according to Sidonius, Apollinaris, and Gregory of Tours, succeeded his Father Pharamond in the Regall estate in the yeare 432. of our Redemption. He was surnamed the Hairy, because hee commanded the French men to weare

long haire in token of Liberty, to the end they might be knowne and distinguished from Romans: or (as some Moderne Writers will have it) to this end, that none should weare long haire, but those of the Royall blood. In the beginning of his Reigne, perceiving the Romans to bee employed altogether against the Vandals in Africke, and a notable dissention betweene Aetius and Boniface, went from his Castle of Dispargun, and fastened upon Cambray, and all that Countrey which lyes betweene the Rivers of Escaut and the Somme, where to this day are the Cities of Monts, Valenciennes, Cambray, and the Forrest heretofore nominated Coaleorrest in ur tonge. 
                  Carbonaire. Afterwards having made a great discomfiture of the Romans, who made head against him, hee came as farre as the Bourough of St. Helens, which is in the Land of Artois. He also subjugated those of Thuringia, the Saxons, and other populations of Almaine, as Funccius is of opinion. O

thers also adde, that the City of Mayence was by him taken in: The Hunnibalt of Trithemius holds, that he divided his Kingdome into two parts, nominating that upon the Coast of the Rhine Austrasie, and the part upon the West, Nenstria or Westria.
               
               The Chronicles of Flanders say, that he led his Army against those of Therovenne, otherwise called Morinians, whom he made subjects: they perceiving their Auxiliars the Cinabres and Ruthenians, and their Captaine Generall Gondmar overthrowne, who had a Daughter whom this Clodion caused to be married to a Nephew of his who was called Flandebert, from whom they will have the Countrey of Flanders to derive its first Nomination, although it is more evident that it was not so called before the time of Charlemaigne. He deceased in the 20. yeare of his Reigne, Anno Domini 450, according to Ado and Aymoinus, leaving (as Jaques Meier and Richard of Wassebourgh doe relate)

                  Ranchaine, or Ranachaire and Alberic (alias) Auberon, his sonnes. Wearing of long haire (as was said) was ordained by this King to bee the Ornament of Princes, whereby Clodamire slaine in Battaile, was knowne from the vulgar Souldiers, and shaving off the Haire was a Ceremony used at degrading of Kings; and Queene Clotilde suffered her Sonnes Heads to be cut off, rather than their Haire, preferring honour to life, and accounting the disgrace which her Children should receive by shaving, making them incapable of the Royall dignity, worse than death; for Life, after the decease of honour, is but a continuall lingring death. Hippone was now besieged by Genserick, King of the Vandals.
               
               Saint Augustine being 76. yeeres old, having seene and suffered in the miseries of the Church, then generally afflicted by the Barbarians, wearied with being a Spectator of those Tragedies, withdrew to Heaven, and dyed,

leaving the Christian World a mourner for his departure.

                     MErovaeus, Maire of the Palace of Clodion (according to Jaques Meier and Richard of Wassebourgh, the Authors afore-said, which Merovaeus neverthelesse the Abbot of

                  Ursperg thinkes, and other French Historians are of opinion to have beene a Bastard-sonne, or a neare Kinsman of Clodion, was by the reason of his valour and experience in Warre, chosen King of the French, Anno Domini 450. secluding the Sonnes of Clodion from the inheritance of the Kingdome. Many are of opinion that he was the first that tooke upon him to March boldly all over the Countries of the Gaules, because by force of Armes hee opened the way into those parts, where none of his predecessors had had any peaceable habitation or abode. And for this cause hee being acknowledged by the Ancient French to be the first King to have passed so farre, the Gauls or Frenchmen were called Merovinians. Others are of opinion that it was, for that he was the first of the Line that reigned over the French untill Pepin, it being that the sonnes of Clodion were supplanted, who betooke themselves for assistance to their Mother in the Kingdome of Thuringia:
                  
where being growne to age, by the ayde of other Nations recovered Almany, Cambresis, Tournay, Henault, and Couloine, of which parts they tearmed themselves Kings, and maintained it against the Merovinians, untill the time of Clovis.
               
               In the meane time Attilla, King of the Hunnes, having spoiled a great part of Europe, laboured to joyne with the Visigoths and French to ruine the Romans, which was a cause that Aetius a Roman Gentleman, who had the command of all the Roman forces of the West, had this Warre in charge, who gave unto Merovaeus the right wing of the Battaile against Attila who lost the field: This Battaile was fought in the Catalaunicke Plaine, which some esteeme to have beene that at Chaalons in Champaigne, others at Solongne by Orleans, who seeme better of opinion than those who would have it neare Tholouse: because it is certaine that Attila never penetrated so farre into the

Countrey of the Visigoths, where the Shock was so bloody and cruell, that there remained one hundred and fourescore thousand men slaine in the place. Merovaeus yeelded to Fate in the tenth yeare of his Reigne, according to Sigebert and other Historians, Anno Domini 459.
               This King was fortunate in his Warres, for after the Death of Aetia, executed by the Emperour Valentinians command, being so faithfull a servant, that it was said that the Emperour had cut off his right hand with his left: by valour, potency, and opportunity hee advanced the Monarchy of France, growing more exact and compleate in strength, hee being the third Stone in that Royall building called Gaule, which new-begun Estate was raised to a greater perfection by many other Royall Builders, descended from his Race, and called Merovingieres, in memory of this Merovee, who, as Titus Vespasian said, Non perdidi
                  
                  diem, so hee accounted that Day lost wherein hee did no good.
               This worthy King was much lamented of all men, they gave him the solemne rites at his funerall, which appertained to a King in those dayes, which was teares and sorrow for forty dayes after.
               The Church was now much troubled by the Nestorian and Eutichean Heresies, which weeds were by two Councells assembled at Ephesus and Chalcedon, plucked up out of the Garden of Christendome, and the true Christian Religion was now defended by Cyrillus and Theoderet, two stout Champions for the Church, who imployed their whole strength and power for the maintenance thereof, so that the remembrance of their pious and noble actions will continue in all ages to their eternall praise and commendation.

lubricity, for which the great and powerfull men of his Kingdome enforced him, having already reigned three yeeres, to flye into the Kingdome of Thuringia, there to expect the issue of his fortune. But before his departure, his friend Vidomare, (or as others report Guiemans) gave him his word and promise, breaking a peece of Gold betweene them, the King keeping the one halfe, and he the other, advising the King that hee should boldly returne when he should receive the other halfe from him.
               Hereupon the French chose in his place Gilles or Gillon Governour of Soissons under the Romans, who reigned as King 8. yeares, in the end whereof Chilperic was re-appealed by Vidomare, who had so dexterously carried himselfe, that Gilles himselfe wrought his owne ruine &amp; hatred which the French conceived against him. Chilperic hereupon endeavouring the recovery of his Kingdome, gained a great battaile

against his Enemy Agrippina, which the French surnamed Coloyne. But in his returne hee sought an ill requitall to so good a friend and Host the King Basin of Thuringia, because hee tooke away with him Basins Wife and Queene, carrying her with him into France, and of her begat Clovis. Trithemius the Abbot saith, that the Dutchies and Counties were erected and instituted by Chilperic in France, who distributed them to those of his blood. But it is more apparent, that the French comming into Gaule, retained onely the generall policy which the Romans had there planted, with the nominations of the Dutchies and Counties, which denominate no more than Provinces generall or subalterne. The Bretons of Gaule Armorick under him tooke their beginning Anno Domini 460. as also the Roman Empire ceased in the West, Anno Dom. 477. Chilperic breathed his last in the 24. veare of his Reigne, about the yeare 484.
               
                  The first part of Chilphericks Life and Reigne was much disgraced by his vicious government, and his owne actions, oppressing his Subjects, and for his lusts satisfaction, abusing their Wives and Daughters: but afterward, being awak'd by affliction, and touch'd with the sense of his former wrongs, he changed his course of Life, and tooke pleasure onely in goodnesse, by his conversion gaining the affection of the French. Thus Affliction doth instruct not destroy a minde capable of Reason; for as Winter stormes kill not the Tree, but keepe downe the wanton sappe, which ascending in the Spring, makes it more fruitfull: so by adversity and misfortune the minde is somewhat opprest, but by vertue it is reviv'd, and brings forth fruite of new conversion, and being dead unto former vices, lives onely to goodnesse, as this King, who in the last part of his life conquer'd his desires, and tryumph'd in that noble Victory.

                  THis Lovis, or Lewis, came to the Crowne, Anno Dom. 485. at the age of 15. He surmounted through his magnanimity, the glory of his predecessors: and wee must ascribe the true entry of the French into Gaule to him, according to the affirmation of

                  Gregory of Tours, Aymoynus, Ado, and the Modernes. For by the overthrow by him given to Siagrius, Count of Soissons, sonne of Gilles the Roman, he reduced the County to the subjection and Lawes of the French, and so abolished that small power and command which the Romans at that time had formerly, in those parts of Gaule, 537. yeares after it had beene subjected to the Roman Empire by Iulius Caesar. After that he espoused Clotilda, daughter of Chilperic, one of the Kings of Burgundy, and being in the tenth yeare of his reigne, he compelled the Thuringians to receive and acknowledge his Lawes. Hee obtained the day at Tolbiac against the Almaines, reducing their Kingdome into a Province and Dukedome: at his returne he became a Christian in the 15. yeare of his reigne, and altered his Coate of Armes. Neare unto Dijon hee overthrew Gondenbault his wives uncle, and in the 25 yeare of his reigne, hee slew

with his owne hands in a battaile Alaric King of the Visigoths, who was an Arian, and drove them out of Gaule, and by that meanes hee submitted to his Kingdome the Countrey of Angolesme, Bourdelois, Perigort, Quercy, Rovergue, Albi, Auvergne, and Tholouze, nothing remaining unconquered of Gaule, but Provence, and a part of Languedoc. Afterwards being honoured with a Patriciall dignity by the Emperour Anastasius, he removed himselfe to Paris, where he established the Regall seat of his Kingdome. Others affirme, that in defiance and despite of all his greatest friends and kinsemen, who at that time commanded a great part of France, siezing their Estates and Lordships, prevented a disturbation of his estate like to ensue. He reigned 30. yeares, and lyes inhumed and St. Peter, and St. Paul, now called St. Genovesue, yeelding his last breath Anno Domin. 513. leaving foure Children, Childebert, King of Paris, Clodomire of Orleance,
                  
                  Clotharius of Soyssons, Theodoricke a bastard, sonne of his K. of Metts, and two daughters; besides that sonne which was slaine in the wars. The Kingdome that was in its infancy of growth was twice mangled and dismembred.
               In the time of this warre, there came a messenger, that brought the King tydings how that one of his sonnes was dead: upon the receipt of which newes he presently tooke the Crowne from off his head, and fell into a heavy and melancholly passion, insomuch, that for the time he was quite bereaved of his naturall sence; which the messenger seeing, added this to his former tale, that his sonne dyed victoriously; hearing of which words, he revived, and tooke up the Crowne, and set it againe upon his Head, and so rested satisfied. When Richar Duke of Cambray, a man of bad conditions and lewd life, was by the King taken prisoner, and put to death, being betraied by the treachery

of his Barons, they imagining, as Seneca saith, that Prosperum ac faelix scoelus, virtus vocatur: That fortunate Treachery, should be esteemed vertuous piety: and being not content with certaine richly guilt Corcelets of Copper, which the King had formerly sent them to procure the effecting of the aforesaid Treason, they complained unto him, that they were but badly recompenced. He answered, The gift of your lives is a sufficient reward for Traytors, who deserve torments rather than preferments for betraying their Lord &amp; Master. Your lives which I suffer you to enjoy, is no small benefit and favour. For Kings, though they seeme to allow Treason, cannot love the Traytor. The Traitors thus upbraided with their wicked nesse, and condemned by their conscience, slunke away from his presence.

                     CHildebert, the eldest sonne of Clovis, succeeded in the Kingdome of Paris, which was the Regall Seate of the Monarchy of France, Anno Domini 514. Upon his undertaking the government, he was by his Brothers instigated, and his Mother

                  Clotilda to the revenge of the death of his Father and Mother, who were by Gondebault murthered: whereupon making Warres upon the Burgundians, their King Sigismund was taken in a Battaile, and together with his Queene and Progeny was throwne into a Well at Orleans. After that, they retreated against Gondemar, brother to Sigismund, where Clodomire was slaine in the pursuite. By the meanes whereof, and the Warres following upon the whole Countrey of France, Gondemar tooke possession of Burgundy: Whilst Theodorick afterwards was against Hermonfroy for the estating himselfe in the Kingdome of Thuringia, by the ayde and assistance of his brother Clotharius; Childebert seized upon the County of Auvergne, but having intelligence of the returne of his Brother Theodorick, whom he supposed to have beene dead, he went into Spaine, against Almerick, King of the Visigoths, on a quarrell for the ill usage of his Sister Clotilda, which

                  Alarick hee slew neare to Toledo, and tooke that City: and upon his returne he reduced Gascogny to his obedience, chasing the Visigoths backe againe into Spaine, by this meanes making the Frenchmen sole possessors of both the Gaules, excepting one part of Provence, which for a time remained in the hands and power of the Ostrogoths of Italy. Childebert upon his returne from Spaine, went with Clotharius to beate Gondemar out of his Kingdome, which was divided betweene them, as also that of Orleans was, after the slaughter of the children of their brother Clodamire, except Claudius that made an escape.
               About that time Theodobald, King of the Ostrogoths of Italy, yeelded up all the possessions they had in Provence, into the power of the French, to the end that they should joyne forces with him against Belisarius, Captaine Generall of the Army of the Emperour Justinian in Italy, in the interim that

                  Childebert and Theodobert through ambition were in an ill course against Clotharius; but these being reconciled by the Nobility of the Countrey, Childebert and Clotharius went into Spaine, and surprised Saragoca. Afterwards upon a plot of Cranne, a Nephew of his, hee made Warre upon Clotharius, who being too eager and earnest to scoure the Field, and cleare him of his Enemies, hee dyed, in the 45. yeare of his Reigne, Anno Domini 558, and according to Sigebert &amp; Aymoynus, 49. Hee lyeth inhumed at St. Germans des prez.
               
               This King was much troubled by his Brethren, with whom he had a divided power, and ruled as the chiefe King; But Soveraignty admits no Partners, for Royall power, like an entire streame, fed by the Spring, whence it descended, will not mingle with other Titles, but doth maintaine an absolute and undenyed Prerogative. His troublesome Reigne concluded with his fatall death,

for he was slaine by a wilde Bull, which he hunted, the manner of his death being an Embleme of his life; for in his life hee persu'd wilde imaginations and vaine desires, untill this sad mischance layd him to rest in a Grave, to shew the vanity of humane designes, which are so soone strooke dead, such is the glory of this World. There is no vertue in this life, except it be to love the thing that is to be beloved; and to love that, is Prudence; and not to be moved or troubled for any matter of molestation, that is Fortitude; nor for any matter of Flattery and delight, that is Temperance; nor for pride, that is Justice.

                     CLotharius, the third legitimate Sonne of King Clovis, having reigned 45. yeares at Soissons, (which is now called the Belgick Gaule) upon the decease of his Brother Childebert, who dyed without issue Males, was proclaimed the 7. King of France:
                  
which his Sonne Cranne perceiving, as being now destitute of the support of his Uncle Childebert, by whose assistance he managed strong Warres against this his owne Father, came and cryed him mercy. But hee made so mall use of his fathers Grace and goodnesse, that hee committed againe a new Fellony and Rebellion against him: And when his latter proceedings began to bee worse and worse in successe than before, hee fled to Conobre, or (as others say) Canabo, Prince and Count of the Bretons, who entertained him, and undertooke to secure him from his Father. Whereupon his Father Clotharius with his Army invaded that Countrey, where they joyned Battaile, wherein the Bretons lost the Field, their Prince being slaine in the place, and Cranne taken Prisoner, whom his Father caused to be shut up in a house, and together with his Wife and children to bee all burnt to death. But Clotharius being the last of the Sonnes of King Clovis,
                  
dyed that same day twelve-month that he justly had caused his sonne Cranne and his to be burnt, in the 51 yeares of his being a King. Anno Dom. 563. leaving behind him foure sonnes, who againe divided the French Monarchy into the former Tetrarchyes; insomuch, that that of Paris befell to the eldest, named Cherebert, or Charibert: Soissons to Chilperic; Orleans with the Kingdome of Burgundy to Gontran; and Austrasy to Sigebert, with the Provinces on this side the Rhyne: but before the partage or division aforesaid, they fell all upon Chilperic, in open Armes, for the surrender of their Father Treasures, which hee had already taken possession of, and by them the City of Paris. Whereupon it seemes that hee tooke it to heart, and ever after maliced his brothers, especially Sigisbert, who had beene the motive (as Paulus Diaconus saith) that the Hunns made warre against him. This King at the time of his death said, Vnach, Anach,
                  
                  How great is the King of Heaven, that hath made subject unto death the greatest Kings and Princes of the world! which speech discovered, that his too much affection to the world, made the approach of death, comming to take off his upper garment of mortality, more terrible, whereas, Mors aequo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas, regumque turres, &amp; sceptra ligonibus aequat.
               
               
                  Death impartially knocks at
                  Poore Cottages, and the Court gate;
                  And equally he bringeth downe
                  Vnto the grave, the King and Clowne.
               
               To satisfie Pope Eugenius, and for feare of Excommunication, for killing Gawler of Quetot his servant, hearing divine Service in his Chappell, hee exempted the Lords of Quetot from homage and service due to the King, thereby to expiate his bloody offence. But although his life was very bad and vicious, and blotted with many impieties, yet in sicknes his soule recover'd some health, by a free acknowledging his sinne, saying,

                  That his onely hope and confidence was in Gods mercy.

                  AFter the decease of Clotharius, Cherebert his sonne was King of Paris, Anno Dom. 564. Hee betooke himselfe to all the kindes and

sorts of dishonest pleasures that his fancy suggested him. Gregory of Tours takes no notice of his reigne, because he governed not long: neverthelesse, this mention he makes of him, that he was excommunicated by S. German Bishop of Paris, for that hee had repudiated his lawfull wife Iugoberge that he might take another, his brothers Chilperic and Gontran, being no waies different in conditions. But Sigisbert was an honourable and a vertuous Prince. Cherebert dyed (according to the report of Sigebert, and the Chronicles of France) in the ninth yeare of his reigne, without issue or any notable memory worthy a King: which was a cause of great controversie betweene his brothers concerning the succession; which in the end proved a warre, which (according to Paulus Aemilius) was of a long continuance: neverthelesse, although Gregory of Tours, and Aimoynus have very confusedly spoken of that warre, without designing or remarking

the time that it begunne, nor what time Cherebert dyed: yet Gregory allowes that there was a sharing of the Kingdome. According to whose Relations, Tours, Poitiers, and Aniou, fell to Sigisbert; but what partsbefell to the others is not mentioned expressely but onely this, that Chilperic obtained a part of Normandy with Rouen: Gontran, Berry, Perigueux, and Gascony. But each of them kept his part in the City of Paris, and promised each to other, that after their departure thence, no one of them after that would enter into it againe, without the consent of the other two. This Cherebert dyed at Blaye, neare Burdeaux, An. Dom. 573. and was buried at St. Romanus of Blaye. Gontran, Sigisbert, and Chilperic were, during their lives, in contention, untill such time as their brother Sigisbert was slaine by two Souldiers, who were put upon that action by Fredegunde, the wife of Chilperic, who was besieged in Tournuy by Sigisbert, who not long before

was acknowledged as King at Paris.
               
               This King was enchanted with the cuppe of pleasure, whereof hee dranke deep, &amp; thereby committed many violent acts: for nulla capitalior pestis, quàm corporis voluptas hominibus à natura data est; unlawfull sinfull pleasure is the cause of all plagues. And therefore Diogenes told Alexander, that hee had alwaies pleasure enough, while Alexander had never enough pleasure; and therefore he did not desire the insatiate pleasures of a King, and a King could not enjoy his pleasures. But this pleasure doth bewitch all the World, especially the sensible and rationall man, onely the spirituall mind can flye a higher pitch, &amp; account all the delights of this world, but like the golden trappings of the Asse, that is made brave to carry greater burthens.

                     CHilperick having reigned Nine yeares at Soissons, and seeing himselfe raised from a meane to a higher degree of his fortune, by the death of his Brother Sigisbert, departed from Tournay to Paris: where having beene received as lawfull King,

                  Anno Domini 577. dispatched his sonne Merovaeus with an Army for the reducing of the Countries and Cities scituated upon the River Loire; but he instead of that service, went directly to Rouen, where by the advice of the Arch-bishop Praetextatus, he married Brunehault, the Widow of the foresaid Sigisbert. Whereupon his father was enraged, and after having dispersed the forces of the said slaine Sigisbert, which came and assaulted him neare Soissons, he shut up Merovaeus in a Monastery at Mans, and afterwards sent his other sonne into Guienne, for the recovery of whatsoever had beene in Sigisberts possession: from whence he was repelled by Patrice Mumole, King Gontrans Lieutenant. In the meane time Merovaeus, who was somewhat nettled, and had betaken himselfe to Brunehault, is constrained to flye into Austrasie; from whence being also expelled, was put to death, and Praetextatus confined to perpetuall Exile. After this Chilperick enforced

                  Waroch, Count of lower Bretagne, to acknowledge vassallage unto him, An. Dom. 584. On the other side, Childebert, who laboured to recover Marsiles which his brother Gontran detained from him, made peace with his Uncle Chilperic, who on his behalfe, with all his forces fell upon Guienne, tooke Lymosin, Perigueux, and Agenois; and as he was very desirous to follow his fortune upon Bourges, he was stayed by the Army of Gontran, with whom he made peace. Not long after Chilperic perceiving too amorous passages of his Wife Fredegund with Landry, Mayre of his Palace, to take away the occasion of his resentment, they caused him that night to bee murthered, as hee returned from Hunting, in the Moneth of September, in the 23. yeare of his Reigne, leaving one sonne, named Clotharius, foure Moneths old. Whilst the Daughter of Chilperic was in her journey to be marryed to the second sonne of the Visigoths, she was stripped, ransacked, and

robbed of her treasure and jewells, and sent backe againe. An. Dom. 586. Helyeth interred at St. German de prez.
               
               The occasion of his murther was the discovering of Fredegunds affection to Landry, for thinking to give his Wife a morning-salutation, hee came booted into her Chamber before hee went to Hunting, and finding her kembing her haire, which lay spread over her face, drew neare without speaking, and with his riding-wand in jest touch'd the hinder part of herhead; she taking the King for Landry, who had free accesse for secret visits, said; In my judgment Landry, a good Knight should alwayes strike before, and not behind: whereupon perceiving that it was the King, who by those words had discovered her minde, while the King was gone a Hunting, plotting the death of Fredegund and Landry, they contrived his death, and by murtherers by them hired, the King accompanied onely with his Page, was killed as he return'd from the Chace.

                  THis Clotharius, the second of that Name, at the age of foure Moneths, An. Dom. 586, succeeded his Father under the tuition of his Uncle Gontran, who confirmed Landry Mayre of the Palace, and constituted him his Lieutenant Generall of

the Kingdome, and retained Paris to himselfe, with all the dependances of the Kingdome of Cherebert, the late King.
               
                  Gontran dyed in the 33. yeare of his Reigne, Anno Dom. 595, having before instituted for his Heire by will Childebert, King of Austrasia, his Nephew, who lost the Battaile at Soifsons against Fredegund, for the Guardianship of his Cousin Clotharius: As also foure yeares after, or thereabout, Childebert being deceased, Brunechilde, who had the tuition of Theodobert and Theodoric her yong sonnes, lost the battaile against her neare Muret. Fredegund in the end dying, the two Kings of Austrasia and Orleans being vexed at the Ambushments of Clotharius, gave him battaile neare unto Sens and Estampes, and left him no more than twelve Counties of his whole Kingdome. Theodoric as victorious and tryumphant enters Paris. After that Theodoric having his hands full of his other brother,

and before that he would undertake any Warre against him, accorded with this his brother Clotharius, that hee would give him the Dukedome of Denthelin, and other parts which hee had taken from him, on condition that he would be a Neuter betweene them. But hee having intelligence of the death of Theodobert, who was slaine neare Cologne in the 17. yeare of his Reigne, enters immediately upon those promised Countries. Theodoric being very desirous that he should let goe his hold, was impoisoned by Brunehault. Clotharius remaining now sole peaceable possessor of the whole Monarchy of France, put all the children of Theodoric to death, except Merovaeus, who was his youngest sonne. Afterwards he punished Brunehault according to her deserts and demerits; and he instituted his sonne Dagobert King of Austrasia, against whom this man was much incensed for the death of his brother Rodoald: but hee was reconciled into favour by the Marriage

of Cometrude, Sister of his last Wife. Clotharius having largely revenged himselfe upon the Saxons, who had revolted and wounded Dagobert, daring that that were without the reach of his Sword, deceased the 45. yeare of his age, and of his reigne 37. An. D. 632. leaving Dagobert by his first Wife, and Aribert by the second.
               
                  Brunehault before mention'd, having caused many murders and mischiefes, was by her owne souldiers yeelded up to Clotayre, and by the chiefest persons of his Dominions, condemned to bee tyed to the tayle of a wilde Mare, and drawne through a stony rough Countrey, being thereby torne in peeces, and dying many deaths in one death; yet St. Gregory in certaine Letters commends her piety and wisedome, for many Temples were by her builded and endowed, while in the Temple of her soule shee sets up Altars to murder and whoredome.

                     DAgobert being possessed of the Crowne Anno Dom. 632. notwithstanding the oppositions of Brunulph, Vncle and governour of Aribert, he assigned him the Countries of Aquitan and Guienne for his maintenance, whereunto he gave the stile and

title of a Kingdome, and bounded it with the River Loire, and the Pyrenian Mountaines. After that he laboured to polish his Kingdome, administring justice to every man. In the ninth yeare of his reigne, which was the third yeare after the decease of his Father, he captivated himselfe to vices, and voluptuousnesse, in such sort, that hee grew infamous, although hee seemed much devoted to the Abby of St. Denis, which he caused to be built, and enriched it with the pillaging of other Churches.
               In the interim, King Aribert deceased the seventh yeare of his reigne, leaving a sonne called Chilperic, who survived him but few dayes, of whose death Dagobert was strongly suspected. Hee immediately united the Kingdome of Aquitan to the Monarchy of France, and dismembred the Dukedome of Almania into divers parts, as Munster affirmes. Hee released the Saxons of a yearely Tribute

of five hundred Cowes, which they payed to those of Austrasia, upon condition that they should keepe the Sclavonians out of the Dominions of France.
               
               After this hee crowned his sonne Sigisbert King of Austrasia. But because that in the 12 yeare of his reigne, Clovis, or Lewis was borne by his wife Nentilde, he confirmed the kingdom of Austracy upon Sigisbert, and designed the occidentall part of his Kingdome, called Neustria, together with that of Burgundy, to his sonne Clovis. At that time Radulphe Duke, and governour of Thuringia, for King Dagobert would needes oppose himselfe against Ansigise Maire of the Palace of Austracy, and make himselfe King; but in vaine. Afterwards Dagobert combated victoriously the rebellious Gascognes, and intending as much to the Bretons Iudicael did him homage for his Kingdome. Lastly, he deceased with a Flux the 19. or, as others affirme, the 29 of Ianuary,
                  
                  Anno Dom. 647. sixteene yeares after the decease of his Father. Hee lyes inhumedat St. Denis: with this King dyed the splendour of the Kings of France, and the power of the Maires of the Palace beganne to take a dangerous and pernicious roote.
               The Character of this King may bee thus drawne: He was better furnished with vertue than his education promised: he strained the Kingdome by Iustice, and brought it to moderation, and obedience; the state thereof beingtoo much slackned by his fathers lenity, and as he had tun'd the government to yeeld a vertuous harmony, he grew into the opinion of his Subjects, by his affection to Piety, which he made to shine most cleare and evident, by building and enriching many Temples, especially St. Denis, honour'd since by being the constant Sepulchre where the Kings of France lye buried. He banished also the Iewes out of his Territories. But these resplendant vertues

were darkened and disgraced by the foule sinne of Adultery, whereby he grew infamous to his Subjects and Strangers, and was so confirmed in this vice, that Anand Bishop of Paris perswading his Conversion, was therefore banished. But his reason was awaked by Pepius constant reprehension, to whom banishment being threatned, yet he persisted, and by a brave importunity, neglecting his owne danger, obtained of the King to bee mercifull unto himselfe, and forsake his sinne; such was the minde of this vertuous Prince to hearken to the words of a wise man which were spoken in season, that ever after he was wary both of his words &amp; actions; leavingan example of loyalty in a servant, and of Reasons victory in a Prince.

                  THis Clovis or Lewis, although he were the younger brother of Sigisbert, whom some hold to have beene borne of a Concubine, tooke the possession upon him of the Kingdomes both of France and Burgundy, under the government of his Mother

                  Nentilde, and of Prince Aega, Mayre of the Palace, who shortly after dyed: in whose place was substituted Ercembault, kinsman to the late Dagobert by the mothers side. In the meane time Pepin, Mayre of the Palace of Austrasie, dyed, into whose office and place his sonne Grimoald would enter. But perceiving himselfe to be opposed by a certaine Otho, who formerly had had the government of Sigebert in his minority made a quarrell betweene him and Leuther, Duke of Almaine, who slew him. After, taking upon him the dignity of Mayre of the Palace, hee matched his Sister Begga to the Duke Ansigise, sonne of St. Arnulph, by whom hee had Pepin Heristel. Nentilde deceased Anno Dom. 651. as also her Favorite Flaveate did, who was by Nation a Frenchman, Constable of Burgundy, and Wilebald Governour of Burgundy Trans-jurane; by the reason whereof Ercembault governed solely the Kingdome, until the King came to age. Afterwards in the yeare

657, Sigebert perswading himselfe that he should have no issue, adopted Childebert, sonne of Grimoald, Mayre of his Palace as his sonne: but after having a son borne to him, whom he named Dagobert, at his decease hee left him to succeede under the charge of Grimoald, who caused the Infant Dagobert to be transported into Scotland by Dudo, Bishop of Poictiers, there to be made a Monke, and caused his owne sonne Childebert to be crowned King of Austrasie; which caused the King Clovis, accompanied with his Mayre Ercembault, to give him battaile, in which they were both taken, and carryed to Paris, where they dyed. By reason whereof Clovis instituted his second sonne Childeric King of Austrasie, and appointed Walfroy for Mayre of his Palace. After that there being a great famine, Clovis tooke all the Plate and Treasure out of the Church of St. Denis, and gave it to the poore, and in recompence thereof hee exempted that

Abby from the subjection of the Bishop of Paris. He departed this life to a better, An. Dom. 665, in the 21. yeare of his age, or as others, 23, and lyeth at St. Denis, expecting a glorious Resurrection.
               This King and many other his successors, retained nothing of Soveraignty, but the name and habilements of Kings, having resign'd their Regall power to their Mayres. For after they had committed all their Authority to these Vice-kings, they themselves did never appeare in publick, but on the first day of May, and then in their Chariots, stuck with flowers, and drawne with 4. Oxen. No suiters were admited to the Kings presence, who in his Chamber surfetted on all kind of pleasure, while the Subjects complained onely to the Mayre, and by him had their wrongs redressed; for the whole government, which belonged unto the Kings, was now ordered by Mayres: yet this King was happy in his Consort and Queene

                  Bandour, of whose Piety and devotion to Religion, the Abby of Shelces, called St. Bandour, and other religious buildings were lasting Monuments.

                  THis Clotharius the third, the eldest sonne of Clovis, succeeded in the Regall power, Anno Dom. 666, (his brother Childeric or Childebert
                  
and Theodoric being very young) Clotharius permitted the sway of government to his Mother Bathilde, and his Mayre of Palace Ercembault, or Ereich, whom some are of opinion to have beene entituled Duke of France, and after the death of this, hee entertained one Ebroin in his place, (or as the Almaine Chronicles say) Eberwin, a German borne, a man cruell, malicious, and wicked, who was preferred unto him by the French.
               
               He was the first, that, abusing the imbecillity and Infancy of his Master, raised the power and authority of his owne dignity to such a heighth it never had before, slighting and misprizing the Majesty and greatnesse of Kings: insomuch that afterwards nothing, of what importance soever, must passe without the approbation of those Mayres, all the Principality (as it were) being solely in their breasts and power, swaying yea, and limiting the expences of their Kings, as they list

themselves: making Warres, Peace, Alliances, Ordinances and Customes of the Kingdome at their pleasure. Some Chronicles say, that the Kings living at their ease and pleasures, shewed themselves but once a yeare in publicke upon the first day of May in a generall assembly, which was held every yeare for the publick affaires of the Kingdome, in a place called The Field of Mars, where they rode in a Chariot drawne by foure Oxen, accompanied with the chiefe of the Baronry, as well hearing the complaints of their Subjects, as giving audience to Embassadors of forraigne Princes; all which they received at the second hand from their Mayres. This Clotharius was surprized by a Feaver, where of he dyed, having reigned foure yeares, without leaving any issue, Anno Dom. 670. Theodoric undertakes the government of the Kingdome, but through the turmoyles betweene him and Ebroin Mayre of the Palace, the subjects enforced him to a Monasticke

life at St. Denis, and Ebroin at Leuxeul in the Franche Contè. Clotharius lyes at St. Denis in France. The composition of his minde was cruell, which the subjects felt in heavy taxations, by him imposed, saying that plenty and peace made them forgetfull of their duty. And of him and his successors it may be said, that they left nothing memorable, but that they left no memory.
               Hee may be reckoned among those Kings that were living Pictures of Soveraignty, shewed every yeare to the people, and so put up againe into his Chamber: but if Vertue be active, and consists in doing good, how could Kings thinke that they might rule by their Deputies? You never knew that Flock of sheepe did thrive, when the Shepheard committed them to the care of an Hireling, or a Boy and a Dogge, for then the poore sheepe are torne by Bryars: so are the poore subjects by oppressions, when Rex dormit
                  
                  securus, when the King sleepes, and suffers his Mayres to governe him and his Realme. Therefore it is said, that no man is good in regard of the nobility of his Birth, but for the excellency of his Vertue: For true Nobility dependeth of Vertue, and all other things are of Fortune. But this was the defect of these times that made soveraigne power have aweake aspect, and not to looke so fine and cleare as it would have done, for this King and many others were then but like Pictures in Arras: yet for all his cruelty, they bestowed upon him those funerall Rites which appertained to Soveraignty, and inhumed him amongst the former Kings.

                  THis Childeric, King of Austrasy, and brother to Clotharius, being called to the Crowne by the Frenchmen, tooke Ulfoalde for his Mayre, but they found themselves as much troubled with him as they had beene with Theodoric and Ebroin, whom

they had made Monkes, and confined into Monasteries. This Childeric, who was a man of no great wit, and dissolute, confined (saith Sigebert) Leger Bishop of Authun, a man of a holy life, to the Monastery of Luxeul: Neverthelesse the Supplement of Idatius affirmes that he was so gracious with him, that he was in a manner as Mayre of the Palace. He caused a Gentleman to be ignominiously whipped, who was of Franconia, called Bodille, by which fact he excited such a scandall against himselfe, and a generall hatred of most part of the Nobility of his Realme, that they all rebelled against him, after the example of Ingolbert (aliâs) Wigobert, and Amalbert; giving such an occasion to Bodille, that he sought all occasions of revenge for the notorious disgrace hee had received from him: who on a day espying him comming from Hunting, caused him to be murthered by the assistance of his Compliees, who also shewed no more mercy to his Queene and

Wife Blivilde, although shee were great with child; which was a cause that Ulfoalde fled into Austrasie, and that the Lords of France, by the advice of Leger Bishop of Authun, tooke Leudesil, the sonne of the late Ercembault, for Mayre of the Palace, who (as it seemes to Aymoynus and Ado) taking Theodoric out of the Monastery, estated him in the Regall Throne.
               
                  Childeric and his Wife were funebrially interred in the Church of St. German des prez lez Paris, Anno Domini 676, and seven yeares after that by the generall consent of the Frenchmen hee was called out of Austrasie to governe the Kingdome of France. Hee left no issue; Sigebert and Paulus Aemilius seeme to confound the History, being of opinion that Childeric reigned after Clotharius 12. yeares, and Theodoric 17. yeares after him: but others hold that the reigne of Theodoric continued 19, in the which they number the yeares of his being a Monke, Childerick being

substituted in his place. This King was another of the same stampe with the former, by nature enclined to tyranny and cruelty, disgracing his well-begun reigne with a bad conclusion: for Kings mounted on the top of Honour, and beholding their subjects with contempt, thrust forward by flattery or ambition, doe easily become Tyrants. And as this Kings life did not shew handsome, so his death plotted and effected by Bodille, did instruct Kings not to dishonour or contemne their Nobility, being their right Arme. And also it shewed, that a disgracefull punishment inflicted on a Gentleman, doth touch the quicke of the soule with a deepe apprehension, for being of a freer tender nature, they scorne as much to receive an injury, as doe any, and therefore they account it Justice to revenge, though they dye in the confirmation of the act: This appeares by Bodille, who concealed her anger, untill like Lightning it struck the King before it was seene; for he must

be silent, full of darke thoughts, and carry his light inward, that will vindicate an injury; and write Mihi &amp; vindictae litavi, this is a sacrifice to Revenge.
            
            
               Theodoric 2. 15. King of France. Anno 680.
               
                  
                     THeodoric (alias) Thierry, the second of that name, having beene called out of the Monastery by Ebroin, who in the time that things were in a combustion

and confusion through the death of Childeric, went and assaulted Leudesie, from whom hee recovered the Royall Finances. Afterwards pursuing him, he, contrary to his promise, caused him to be put to death, and causing himselfe to bee re-estated in that dignity of which formerly hee had beene deprived, persecuted all those that had any way opposed him, filling all France with murtherous cruelties: insomuch, that he put to death Leger, Bishop of Authun, and his brother Guerin. Whilst the Austrasians substituted Pepin, Heristed, Maire of the Palace of Austrasie, in the place of Vlsoald, and appoynted for his Coadjutor Martin, his Cousen German, sonne of Clodulphe, second Sonne of S. Arnulph. Where of Ebroin being advertised, went to give them battaile at a place called Locofic, where Pepin was enforced to betake himselfe into Austrasie for safety, and Martin to Laon: From whence Ebroin, upon his word given him in

way of promise, fetcht him out, and caused him to be put to death. Immediately hereupon Hermonfroy slew Ebroin, and for refuge betooke himselfe to Pepin. By the reason whereof, Theodoric took to bee Maire of the Palace one named Waraton, a man well advised, who having beene supplanted and undermined by his sonne Gislemare, who dyed shortly after, entered into the State, although hee kept it not long, but dying left it in the hands and power of Bertaire, who in such a high nature disgusted the Lords and Nobility of France, that they withdrew their affection from him, and there went (namely Andr amne and Reole) to consult with Pepin for a Warre upon Theodoric the King, and Bertaire, who was neare Taxieres in Vermandois defeated, and the said Bertaire slaine by some that pursued him. Whereupon Theodoric made a peace with Pepin, and gave him the office of Maire of his Palace, as

he already had that of Austrasie. Pepin being desirous to compose the matters of Austracy in order, instituted Norbert as his Lievtenant in France, in his absence. Afterwards he made his eldest sonne Drogon Duke of Campagne: Pepin began to governe in France, Anno Domini 687.
               
                  Theodoric deceased 688. having reigned nineteene yeares, beeing a wonderfull patient King, and one that would not be moved with any small disaster that should have happened unto him, either through the Divine Power, or Humane Resistance. Hee left behinde him three Sonnes, Clovis, Clotharius, and Childebert.
               
               This King being onely a picture of Soveraignty, without any active motion, Ne vixisse inutilis olim, videatur, left issue to shew that he had lived. He sate like a patient man, and beheld the Tragedies playd by the Mayres, as they had beene a game of

Tables, untill Pepin wonne the set and Soveraignty of France.
               
               This King was of a slow disposition, not contemning, but neglecting the World; for if he had onely slighted earthly glory, he would have violated Curius, who when the Samnites brought him great store of Treasure, as he was sitting by the fire side, hee said, Non aurum haberi praeclarum sibi videri dixit; sedeis, qui haberent aurum, imperare: He accounted it no glory to have store of Gold, but to governe those that had store of gold. This was a magnanimity of minde, but a dejected minde in a Prince, suffering a Subject to over-toppe him, did not expresse the Courage of a Caesar, or an Alexander, that desir'd to bee Monarchs of the whole world.

                  AFter the decease of Theodorick, Clovis, his eldest sonne, began his Reigne in his minority, Anno Domini 689, having Pepin for Mayre of his Palace, who was surnamed Heristel, sonne of Ansigise, under whom France, that heretofore seemed to bee divided,

and (as it were) dismembred, seemed now to be as an entire body, as formerly it had beene, and began to recover its pristine lustre and honour, which it had in a manner lost by the precedent divisions, and intestine dissentions; which also had given an occasion to the Aquitans and Gascognes to range apart under the government of one proper and peculiar Prince, whom they styled Duke; an occasion that Roderic of Toledo tooke to make mention of one called Loup who was about that time.
               
                  Clovis reigned (according to the Contivator of Gregory of Tours, Ado, and Sigebert) onely foure yeares, although Aimoynus, through the default of Writers, acknowledgeth but two yeares. And it seemes that in his time the Saxons and Swedes, who upon the occasion of the precedent Warres by the succession of times, had withdrawne themselves out of the obedience to the French, were by

                  Pepin summoned to their duty. And because they made him know that they would not performe any such thing but upon compulsion, hee passed over the Rhine with an Army against them, wherewith hee gave them such downe-right knocks, that he beate them into a subjection according to his desire. By the meanes whereof France for some space of time continued in peace, recovering by little and little its authority and renowne amongst other Nations and strangers. Wherefore Clovis had no leasure to enjoy a long content, because hee dyed, although young, (as it is said) leaving the succession to his brother Childebert, An. Dom. 692. The place of his death or interrment is not mentioned in any Authors.
               This King reigned but foure yeares, and therefore his Character may bee drawne by the Embleme of the Sunne rising, with a faire and cleare aspect, but

presently over-cast with thick clouds, having this Motto, Orior &amp; morior.
               
               
                  As the Sunne which fairely rose,
                  Is hid with clouds that doe enclose
                  The cleare beames, while that it doth shew
                  A sorrow, weeping teares of dew:
                  So this King rose to a Crowne,
                  And setting soone in death, went down
                  Leaving the Spheare of Majesty:
                  His Motto this; I rose to dye.

                  After the death of Clovis, his brother Childebert succeeded him, and reigned according to all Authours, 17. or 18. yeares, except Ado, who alloweth him but 13. Neverthelesse it seemeth that it was in his time that Pepin made warre upon Ratbod,
                  
Duke of Frizeland, who was as yet a Pagan and an Idolater; so that he being overthrowne, Pepin would not grant him any conditions of peace, unlesse he would permit a Monke called Wilebros, (aliâs) Clement, a learned and vertuous man, might freely give instructions to the Frizons in the Christian Religion; which for the most part was generally approved and liked by the people: but the Nobles and chiefe men remained and continued in their ancient errour together with their Prince. Moreover, that Pepin was a man accomplished, and of singular parts, yet contrary to the Lawes of Marriage, he was so much taken with the fond love of a Gentlewoman called Alpaide, that hee utterly loathed his wife Plectrude. By reason whereof Lambert, Bishop of Utrecht, or (as some report) Liege, a man of a holy life, boldly undertooke to lay open his sinne unto him, although he had restored him to his See Episcopall, whereof Ebroin had deprived him. Whereupon

                  Alpaide was so much enraged, that shee instigated her brother Dodon to kill him: but he and his associates received a reward due for such a demerite and murther. Pepin on the other part hearing that Norbert his Lieutenant of Maireship of France was deceased, substituted his second sonne Grimoald in the place, and caused him to marry Theudesinde, Daughter of Ratbod, Duke of Frizeland.
               
               About five yeares after, Drogon, the sonne of Pepin, Duke of Champagne, dyed, (as Ado noteth) Anno Dom. 708, but according to Sigebert, 699, whose estates were by Pepin given to his sonne Thibault: after that, seeing the Swedes to rebell against Childebert, under the conduct of Villarius he sent Anepos Bishop against them with a powerfull Army, which overthrew them, saith Ado. Childebert deceased An. Dom. 710, having reigned 17. yeares, leaving issue, Dagobert, Clowis, and Daniel.
               
               That which is chiefly observable in

this King, was his dotage on Alpaide, a faire &amp; beautifull Gentlewoman, whom he loved beyond all respect of himselfe, letting his Fame bleed to death, wounded with a bad report for his incontinent life. For that King that is addicted to the love of a woman, hath all his senses so charmed, that he understands nothing but his pleasure, and is quite given over to follow his owne wicked desires. For, Est infoelicius quàm meretrice nihil.
               
               
                  A Whore may well compared be
                  Unto a Garden of misery:
                  He that doth both touch and taste
                  Her fruite, doth unto death make haste.
               
               And hee that endeavours to make a King see his owne vice, does alwaies perish in the attempt, &amp; resembles Virgils poore Gnat which the shepheard killed with clapping his hand against his face, while he strove to wake him. So Bishop Lambert, that would have wak'd the King, was by Alpaides plot and the Kings consent murdered.

to posterity, but onely the death of Grimoald, Maire of the Palace of France, which was Anno Dom. 714. in April, who was miserably slaine by a Souldier, a Frizelander, in the Church of St. Lambert, belonging to the See of Liege, whither he went to visite his father Pepin then lying sicke in his bed, whereof he dyed the same yeare, about the midst of December, having executed both the Maireships with great honour for the space of 27. yeares and a halfe, after he had surrogated Thibault to his sonne Grimoald to be Maire. He resigned the Mayery of Austrasie to a naturall sonne of his called Charles, whom he had by his Concubine Alpaide, already perceiving in him the signes of a great Generosity, which enabled him for such a charge, although hee were but yet very young. Which gave an occasion to Plectrude, the lawfull wife of Pepin, cunningly to surprize him, and to imprison him in the City of Cologne, as well for the Novercall jealousie shee

had of him, as for having meanes also to ruine the estate of Austrasie, as also of France, being in the hands of her younger sonne Thibault, assuring herselfe that the managing of businesses would passe well enough under his name: But the Frenchmen not willing to be governed by a Woman, being grieved also that the office of the Maire should be hereditary, which formerly had beene by Election, made an insurrection against Thibault, whom they forced to flye into the Forrest Cocie. After that they chose Ranfroy for Mayre: The same yeare 714. Dagobert dyed, having reigned 5. yeares.
               This King was disswaded from the love of Alpaide, by Lambert Bishop of Vtrect, whom this cruell Dame in revenge caused to be slaine by her brother Dodon, strucke after the acting this Murder, with a disease of wormes, the stench whereof he being not able to endure, threw himselfe headlong into the River of Menze. See here a punishment

to affright the sinfull soule; a King that had before lived in a most voluptuous manner, that made a Whore the Center of all his thoughts, thinking all happinesse to be contained within that circumference, having lost his reason, and being wholly governed by a petty-coat, what a sad and fatall end did he meete withall! For pleasure comes with a faire alluring face, tempting to taste of her Circes Cup, but when shee turnes her backe, she hath a ragged ugly shape, which offends the sight, and brings the mind to sad repentance. This King had highly sinned, and now wormes began to be bold with him, and eate his living flesh, so that corruption did not follow after death, but contrary to nature hee rotted and corrupted while he lived, untill the worme of conscience tormented his soule; a miserable death attending a bad life.

                     CLotharius the fourth, sonne of Theodoric, who was the fifteenth King of France, was brother to the Kings, Clovis the third, and Childebert the second, and Uncle to Dagobert the second; and by the plots of Charles Martel, upon the decease of Dagobert,
                  
was made King. For, hee perceiving that the greatest part of the French had constituted King, a certaine Daniel, a man of the Royall blood, whom they had drawne out of the Monastery, and nominated him Chilperic the second; he, by force of Armes having valiantly fought it out in the field, and victoriously overthrowne them, (as hereafter shall be mentioned) made himselfe Master of all France, and from thenceforth Charles Martel against his will was made King: But he knowing that the French, that could not containe themselves without a King, and would not admit any to the Title, but those of the Royall blood, knowing also himselfe not so descended, he caused this Clotharius to be Crowned King, as the next of blood; not that hee thought him worth such a dignity as that of a Kingdome, but for a gaining of authority by this faire pretext, and for the transferring of the Crowne of France by little and little to his Children, which afterwards

came to passe. For under the name of Clotharius, Charles Martel did what he pleased, which so fortunately succeeded daily, that by this meanes he made a scaling-Ladder for his sonne Pepin to the Crowne: So, that Clotharius the fourth, was made but an imaginary or titulary King, who did not any thing worthy of memory, because hee reigned not above two yeares or little longer: and in the time of his reigne, all France was in great Factions and Divisions, by the reason of so many pretendants to the Office of Maire of the Palace: also that Charles Martel had after him the entire government of the whole Kingdome, and command of all; insomuch, that he was called, Prince of the French-men, great Master and Governonr of France: And Clotharius had but the bare title of King: which is a cause that Paulus Aemilius, and other Historians have not inserted him into the Catalogue of the Kings of France. The

aforesaid Clotharius deceased about the yeare 719, and lyeth inhumed at Nancy.
               
               This King, having not the power of a King was like a Picture of Majesty, for some years exposed to the publick view, but afterwards death drew a Curtaine between him and the world, and then he was soone forgotten, whereas vertue doth give a second life to Princes, while their name is preserved fresh in memory: For Sola virtus expers Sepulchri.
               
               
                  Vertue alone can never dye,
                  But liveth still in memory.
               
               And therfore that excellent monument, better than any Marble stone cut into forme by Carvers Art, is the statue of the mind, not that of the body: for Statuae huiusmodi relinquendae, quae virtutis sint monumenta magis, quàm staturae corporis.
               
               
                  That King doth need no Tombe cut out by Art,
                  Whose Fame doth live in every Subjects heart.

                     DAniel, whom some affirme to have beene the Sonne of Childebert, and brother to Dagobert; and others, that he was onely of the blood Royall, was taken out of the Monastery to bee

made King; and his former name was changed into Chilperic, Anno Domini 715. In the beginning of his Reigne he entered into a confederacy with Ratbode Duke of Frizeland. In the meane time Charles Martel escaped the imprisonment of his Step-mother Plectrude: and as hee made all possible meanes and waies for the recovery of his right, before that hee could effect any thing, he was by Ratbode defeated, neare the Meuse, before that Rainfroy, and Chilperic could come to charge him. Neverthelesse, Anno Domini 716. after, as the Frenchmen went with a Convoy of an infinite treasure of monyes from the parts neare Cologne, which Plectrude had given them. Charles Martel set upon them with such a fury, that he enforced them to forsake it neare unto Albis. By the meanes whereof, taking heart for this his first fortunate enterprize, he overthrew Rainfroy, and Chilperic, Anno Domini 717. the

21 of March, neare unto Vinciate, who came with an intent of an ample revenge, Charles by this victory assuring himselfe of the French, desirous to reduce the rest of the Kingdome of Austracy, entered by force into Cologne, and forced Plectrude to surrender unto him all his Fathers Treasures. And for the greater validity of his cause, puts one forward (whom some esteeme to have beene the Uncle of the last King Dagobert, called Clotharius, or Lotharius) forcing him to take upon him the title and name of King: with him afterwards hee went to encounter Chilperic, and Rainfroy, who by the meanes of Eude Duke of Aquitan, or Gaseogne, were destitute of their Forces, being by him defeated, and overthrowne in Champagne, insomuch, that for safety Chilperic retired to the said Duke with all his Treasures: Anno Domini 719. Clotharius, the titulary King, departed this life, whereupon Charles Martel
                  
sent to demand King Chilperic of Eude, that he might bee sent unto him: by whom he was afterwards acknowledged as a King, and entertained Eude, into his amity and love. Chilperic also a yeare after deceased, Anno Dom. 720. having reigned five yeares and a halfe in a troublesome and turbulent Stare, which was scarce settled in all the time of his Reigne: Charles Martel, with Clotharius, (or Lotharius, who had tooke the name and title of King) raising many perturbations in his Kingdome: But Death at length drew his dayes to a period, after his great and manifold troubles, and lyeth interred at Noyon.

                     THeodoric was by Charles Martel substituted to Chilperic, Anno Domini 720. and reigned onely titulary, as others had done before him, for the space of eighteene yeares. Charles Martel left Aniou to Rainfroy,
                  
upon condition, that hee should resigne the office of Mayre, and after that went to terrifie and chastise the Saxons, who had rebelled: at which time Ratbod Duke of Frizeland dyed A. D. 727. He brought the Almaines into such a servitude to the French, that before that time they never performed. Afterwards, having enforced Plectrude to come to an agreement, he marched into Aquitan, against Eude, where in the way hee, by a generall Parliament, made himselfe to bee stiled Prince of the French. Whereupon Eude, more enraged than vanquished, incited the Saracens of Spaine, by the meanes of Muguoce, Lord of Lerdane his sonne in Law their servant, whom Charles encountred before Tours, and gave them an overthrow by the assistance of the said Eude, who was enforced to take his part by reason of the insolencyes committed by the Saracens, who had now come downe into his Countrey. In this expedition hee gained the sirname

of Martel, for the Mortality he made of his enemies. After the ending of this warre, he went against the Burgundians, to punish them for their rebellion, and also those of Provence. After that, knowing the death of Eude, he reduced Gnienne and Aquitaine into his obedience, dis-inheriting Gaifer and Walde the sonnes of Eude; who retiring themselves into Gothland, and Septimany (alias) Languedoc, recovered by the assistance of the Visigoths, a part of Guienne, in the meane time that Martel was in warres against Pepin, the sonne of Ratbod, whom he overthrew, and forced the Frizons to become Christians. After, having sent backe his Vncle Childebrand against the Visigoths and Saracens, who had possessed Avignon, himselfe went to quell Burgundy, now upon a revolt, and by the aide of Luitprand, King of the Lombards, he went to drive Athin out of Narbon, and out of all Languedoc, and Provence, all which he submitted to

the Crowne of France, and hee tooke away the Earledome of Marsiles from Count Morice, who had delivered Avignon to the Saracens. Theodoric dyed about they yeare 740.
               It was a usuall custome for great Warriers and Souldiers in those times to get some titular addition to their name; as Alexander was called Ille magnus; so Martel was so sirnamed, Quasi mortalis, or Martialis, because he was mortal in his expeditions, &amp; full of martiall valour; he was the first founder of the second Race of the French Kings, and therefore must needes be a man of great vertue, since the raisers of private families are either Saints or Divells, that get honour by vertue, or goe to hell for it, to leave it to their Posterity.

                     CHilderic succeeded his brother Theodorick, Anno Domini 740. He was the last King of the race of the Merovees, Charles Martel deceased at Paris, October the 22. An. Dom. 741, leaving Carloman and Pepin surnamed The short, Giles Arch-bishop of Rouen,
                  
(and Griffon, who was by another Mother) Carloman and Pepin tooke upon all their Fathers possessions, and entituled themselves Dukes and Princes of the French. They called Hunaud to accompt, who had made himselfe a proprietary Lord of Aquitaine. In the meane time Griffon fastened upon Laon, claiming it as his right; from whence he was fetcht out, and imprisoned at Ardennes. After Carboman having compelled the Almans (who had revolted) to his obedience, An. Dom. 743, went with his brother to combate Odilon (or) Vtilon, Duke of Bavaria, who was now in Rebellion, and had stolen and married their sister: whom they having compelled to alter his Title of King to Duke, they were contented he should peaceably enjoy their Sister as his wife. At their departure out of Bavaria, An. Dom. 744. they went against the Saxons, whom they enforced to undergoe their accustomed yoake, giving their Duke Theodoric as an Hostage, who

upon his owne word was sent backe; but the yeare following hee was againe taken in a relapse of a new revolt against the French. An. Dom. 746. Carloman became a Monke of Mount Soracte in Tuscany, and afterward at Mount Cassin. Whereupon Pepin reduced the whole Monarchy into his sole power. Afterwards hee pursued his brother Griffon, who had retired himselfe into Saxony, and from thence into Bavaria, from whence Pepin having fisht him, hee brought him into France, and gave him the Dukedome of Angely in Normandy. After this Pepin affecting to joyne to himselfe both the name and the Royall Authority, wrought with Pope Zachary by Bouchard Bishop of Witsbourg, and by Volrade his Domesticke Chaplaine so farre, that the States of France assembling at Soyssons, following the declaration of Pope Zachary, degraded Childeric and his wife Gisale, and sent them to live a Monasticke life in the Countrey of Bavaria, Anno Dom. 752.

Thus was the Merovaean race deprived of its honour 293. yeares after the death of Merovaeus.
               
               This King and his Queene were enforced to be religious, and being depos'd, were sent to a Monastery; for it was a usuall custome sometime to confine the right Heire to such houses, or when they would be tid of their Kings, they did shave their heads, and made Monks of them, wherein it may bee they did their soules good; but compelled Religion can never be sound. Jerome living in a wildernesse beheld Rome, and a King in a Cave will thinke on a Crowne, and therefore it may be said,
               
                  When a King weares the Fryers hood,
                  He is either very bad or good.

                  ONE Charles Martel is placed here amongst the Kings of France, not because in his life time hee tooke upon him the Name and Title of a King, but because indeed hee commanded all France (after that hee had made an escape out of the imprisonment

of Plectrude his Mother in law) untill his death: having made himselfe to bee created in an Assembly of three Estates of the Kingdome, Prince and Duke of the Frenchmen, more haughty and illustrious than that of Mayre of the Palace, wherewith his Predecessours were contented, and the Kings that reigned in his time, had onely the bare Name and Title, without any power at all, as it hath beene already mentioned; yea, and after his decease his successors qualified him as a King, as it appeares by his Tombe in the Church of Denis in France, where his Statue is crowned, and acoutred with Robes of Regality, and is written about it in Latine words, Charolus Martellus Rex. And justly hee may be so styled, because there was no King in his time, but who he pleased.
               
                  Pepin Heristel was his Father, Ansigise his Grandfather, S. Arnulph his great Grandfather, who being a Widower was made Bishop of Mets, which S. Arnulph was directly descended in the

Masculine Line of Clodion, the sonne of Pharamond, the first King of France. This Charles was so valiant and generous, that he obtained the Surname of Martel, for the exceeding great strength of his arme, and the memorable Victory which he obtained against the Saracens, neare unto the City of Tours, of whom he slew in the place to the number of 375. Thousand. He reduced the whole Countrey of Languedoc, otherwise called Septimany, to the Monarchy of France, which untill that time was not warranted. Hee was very zealous in the defence of the Christian Religion: yea, and Rome it selfe being distressed by the siege of Luitprand, King of the Lombards, and brought into great extremities, Pope Gregory sent by a Bishop Anastasius and Sergius a Priest, the Keyes of the Sepulchre of St. Peter to Prince Martell, whereby he intimated unto him, that he put himselfe, the Church and the City of Rome into his protection and safeguard. Wherefore

he sent Embassadors to the Lombards, to intreate them for his sake to desist, and to permit a peace to the City of Rome: which tooke such effect, that from that time afterward the Popes in all distresses sought to France for reliefe upon all occasions, whereof they never were destitute. In the end the Goths being vanquished, the Saxons and Frizons subdued, Languedoc conquered, and Provence recovered, and France enjoying the tranquillity of a happy peace. Charles made a distribution of his estate to his Children, and shortly after dyed the 22. of October, Anno Domini 741, who was the first that was ever styled Prince of France, and lyes at St. Denis in France.
               
               This Charles Martell being King of France in power, though not in Title, did make Childeric called Daniel, Clotarius the fourth, Theodoric the second, and Childerick the third, successively Kings of France. The Realme and Crowne of France being by Childerick
                  
the third offered to Charles Martell, who refused the Diademe, saying, That it was more glorious to reigne over kings, than to be a King, as appeareth by this Epitaph on his Monument.

                  The Duke of Braban, whom Fame doth renowne
                  For the chiefe Champion of all Christendome,
                  Ruled both Dukes and Kings, and did disdaine
                  To be a King, but over Kings did reigne.
               
               He had foure sonnes, Caroloman and Giles of modest milde spirit, Pepin and Griffon rough and ambitious: he left to Caroloman, Austrasia; to Giles, being more hardy, France; and Giles given to devotion, hee made Bishop of Roan; and Griffon being of a turbulent dispotion, had no portion, but was enforced to depend on his brothers, whereby the ambition of many brothers reigning together was prevented.

Fame doth report that this Monarchy nor any forraigne State did ever yeeld a worthier man, or any one so well accomplisht with so rare and goodly qualities, being greatly admired and generally beloved for his pious and renowned actions. For Religion, Wisdome, Justice, Valour, modesty in prosperity, resolution in adversity, temperance in Authority, diligence, and good fortune, made him a most compleate Prince, not wanting any endowments fit for so high a calling; and the example of vertuous perfection, for Vertue is the highest perfection of Nature, beyond which humane frailty cannot reach.

                     PEpin the short, sonne of Charles Martell, was crowned King of France in the beginning of the yeare 752, by Boniface Bishop of Magence. The Saxons rebelled the yeare following, but Pepin made them very feelingly sensible of their default. An.
                  
                  Dom. 754. Pepin having beene againe annointed and crowned in the Church of St. Denis by Pope Stephen, successour to Zachary, who came to demand ayde of him against Astulph King of the Lombards, passed over the Alpes, and two severall times put the King Astulph into such streights and extremities, that he was constrained to surrender to the Pope duties belonging to St. Peter, the Segniory of Ravenna, and all that hee could claime in Romania: whereupon the Emperour of Constantinople, to whom those Territories did belong, being much discontented, An. Dom. 759 overthrew the rebellious Saxons, and compelled them to pay tribute at every generall Parliament of France 300. Horse fit for service of Warre. From thence hee went against Waifer, Duke and Governour of Aquitaine, and enforced him to come to a composition, which neverthelesse had no effectuall issue, untill hee had defeated him in divers battailes, and taken the greatest

part of his principall Cities. Which Waifer perceiving, and the taking of his Mother, Sisters, and Nieces, was enforced to commit the rest of his fortunes to the hazard of a Battaile neare Perigord, where, with the day he lost his life also, and his Principality likewise.
               Moreover Aquitaine received a governour (who in those times was styled Duke) from the appointment of the King, and was reunited to the Crowne of France. Pepin retreating with his Army, was arrested with a fit of sicknesse at the suite of Death, whereby he paid Nature what he was indebted, the 24. of September, in the 54. yeare of his age, Anno Domini 768, leaving by his Queene Berthe, Charles, and Charlemaine, to whom by a partage they made betweene them, the Occidentall part of France, together with Burgundy, and Aquitaine befell to Charles, who established his Seate at Noyon: and to Charlemaine the Orientall, whereunder

the Provinces on this side the Rhine were comprised, and held his Court at Soyssons.
               
               This King was the first of the second Race, under whose vertuous government the happinesse of France was much improved, and in his sonnes Reigne; but Vertue being no inheritance descending to posterity, the glory of the Kingdome by the vices of succeeding Kings declined, shewing that Grace and Goodnesse are the absolute free gifts of God. That which assured him of his Subjects love, and made him become gracious in their estimation, was his honourable Actions, followed by the love and obedience of his Subjects, for the attractive love of Vertue firmely obliges subjects to their Prince, and doth by a secret violence draw their affections. His last act concluded in a Royall death, being happy in his honours and hopefull Children, one of his sonnes being afterward acknowledg'd the worthiest and most excellent

Prince that ever reigned: And himselfe by his vertue and valour gaining his subjects love, instructed Princes that the subjects love is the strongest guard, and that Vertue is the best preserver of Majesty, giving a good and prosperous successe unto all their actions by whom she is embraced and dayly followed, never leaving them hopelesse in any danger which may seeme to threaten them, but rather encourage and comfort their troubled spirits with assurance of overcomming and withstanding whatsoever may prove obnoxious or hurtfull unto them, and lastly, it doth not onely enrich a man with all temporall blessings here in this life, but hereafter advance him to immortall honour.

                  NO sooner had Charles made a partage with his Brother Charlemayne, but he was enforced to restraine Lupus Duke of Gascoigne, and Hunaut of Aquitaine with including them in a Fort called Fressac, built

neare to Libourne. After that, marrying with the daughter or sister of Didier, King of the Lombards, he entertained Trasilon Duke of Bavaria, into his amity. The yeare following, Charlemaine deceased, leaving two sonnes, whom Charles permitted not to govern in their fathers estate, but annexed it to his owne. After that hee made warre upon the Saxons, and in the yeare 773. at the request of Pope Adrian, hee tooke Didier in Pavia, whom hee confined in banishment to Liege, recovering all the possessions he had in Italy. And the same yeare he returned against the Saxons, where hee founded a Fort by the name of Francfort. Againe, being gone into Italy against Adelgise, sonne of Didier, who was revolted, hee returned immediately against the Saxons, whom he forced to imbrace Christianity. Anno Domini 776. The same yeare hee tooke from the Sarazens in Spaine, Pampelonne, Saragosa, and made many

Kings tributaries: in his returne from thence the Gascognes slew most of the best men of France. Hee subdued the Bretons of the lower Brittagne, who had revolted: and Anno Domini 787. He tooke the fidelity of Adagise, Duke of Benevent, and of Trasilon, Duke of Bavaria, whereupon he confiscated to his owne use, the whole Countrey of Bavaria, and enforced Theodon, and his sonne to a Monasticke life. Hee overthrew likewise the Sclavonians, and the Vandals, who held the Countrey of Brandebourg, Malgebourg, and Pomerania, and also the Huns, and Avarois, who at that time possessed Pannonia. Hee was saluted Emperor Anno Domini 801. upon Chistmas day. And having received presents from the King of Persia, hee was sought in marriage by the Empresse of Irene. After that, having combated the Venetians by his sonne Pepin, and defeated the Normans; and having founded the Vniversities of Paris,
                  
                  Bologne and Pavia; an intending to unite the Channell of the Rhine with that of Danubius, he was intercepted by Death, Anno Domini 814 beeing threescore and twelve yeares of Age, having reigned over the French sixe and forty yeares, and of Italy three and forty, and of his Empire foureteene, and lyes inhumed in Aix la Chapelle.
               
               This Charles got some addition to his name, as Alexander the Great, being indeed great in the gifts of body and minde, Arts, and Armes. The ground-worke whereon he raised noble Trophies to Fame, was Religion, to which he give due honour, and from thence deriving Morall perfections, he grew an admired Prince, naturally favouring the Muses, learned in the Greeke and Latin languages. Philosophy, the Mathematicks, and other Sciences, hee cal'd his pastimes and companions of his sword. Something he wrot in Poetry for recreation, but

he especially delighted in History, the Register of noble Actions.
               The Acts of Charlemaine in the Life of his Brother Caroloman, were many, and most renowned, and also when he was King alone, but when he was enstalled Emperour, he crowned all those actions by his care of the Church, and his godly preparing for Death: for hee was much enclined to to the reading of such Bookes as were for the bettering of his understanding, and which tended to the leading of a vertuous and godly life; as may appeare by his spending three yeares in reading the Bible and St. Augustines Bookes before he dyed. And the Character of his Life was: That his vertue was the paterne of Princes, and his good fortune the subject of their wishes.

                     LEwis, who was left the sole son of Charlemagne, was consecrated at Rheimes by Pope Stephen, Anno Domini 814. In the beginning of his Empire, he reduced the Sclavonians, Sorabes and Gascoignes under his

obedience who had revolted upon the death of Charlemaine: He held a Parliament at Aix, where he caused his eldest sonne Prince Lotharius, to bee crowned Emperour with him, and caused his other sonnes to bee Crowned Kings, giving unto Pepin the Kingdome of Aquitaine, and to Lewis the Dutchy of Bavaria. By reason whereof, his Nephew Bernard rebelled against him, who by a sentence of the Emperours Counsaile had his eyes pulled out, whereupon he dyed with griefe. From thence Lewis went against the Bretons, who had made an insurrection, and chaced Lindeute, Governour of Austria, out of Pannonia. And having Anno Domini 824 renewed his alliance with Michael the Emperour of Constantinople; and his wife Hermingarde being dead, he marryed with Judith, daughter of the Count Artolf, which Iudith, because she advanced hers to the disadvantage of the Emperours Children, was a cause that they raised

an army against their Father; who having confined her into a Monastery of Italy, she was put into a Coffer at St. Medards of Soissons, from whence she was conveyed out by the French Princes. Lotharius seeing this, fled into Italy: The troubles of France being appeased, the Danes and Normans ransacked the Countrey of Zeland, and Frizland, and also the Bretons rebelled. Also the Saracens much perplexed the Emperor in the chasing them out of Italy and Provence, who finding himselfe neare his end, bequeathed unto his son Charles the Occidentall part of France, and by the death of Pepin, A. D. 838. Aquitaine was added; &amp; to Lotharius he left the Empire, with the rest of the Kingdome of France; &amp; to Lewis the kingdom of Bavaria. Lewis being discontented at this partage, would needes take Almaine into his power: but having beene hindered two severall times by the Emperours Army, in the end the Emperour dyed in an Isle of the Rhine the sixtieth yeare of his age,

and the 27. of his Empire and reigne. Anno Domini 840.
               This Lewis was of a milde and gentle disposition, fitter to be a Church-man, than a King; wherby he grew contemptible to his Subjects; yet milde natures much provoked are violent in revenge; for having taken Bernard, he imprisoned him, then put out his eyes, and all the Bishops &amp; noblemen his adherents: Hee indiscreetly gave his sonnes their portions, and thereby procured his own affliction, arming them with strength to rebell against their Father; and for affection to Church-men he was by them censured for his cruelty to the Bishops, to be confined to a Monastery, while the Clergy adhered to the rebellious Children against the father; whose late attempt was to chastise the insolency of of his sonne Lewis; but age and griefe concluded his happinesse, and the good old King having felt enough vexation in the unnaturall rebellion of his Children, forsooke the world, and so found rest and happines.

                  THis Charles the Bald having attained to the Kingdome, Anno Dom. 840, made great Warres against Lotharius, untill hee gave him battaile at Fontenay: During these debates the Bretons revolted, and the Normans came even unto Paris to sacke

the Abby of St. German, insomuch that Charles was enforced by money to hire them to a retreate. After this, Charles went against Neomenius King of Bretagne, whom he routed and defeated twice afterwards. Anno Dom. 851. after, Aquitaine fell into the hands of Charles, who encloystered his Nephews Pepin and Charles. Hee againe overthrew the Bretons; the Normans on the other side tooke the City of Nantes, confounding all with blood and fire, not sparing the Bishop who was then at Masse.
               Fifteene yeares after the battaile at Fontnay, Charles the Bald made himselfe to be annointed King in the City of Limoges. Lotharius became a Monke, leaving the government to his son Lewis; but that part of Gaule beyond the mountaines, was divided betweene Charles and Lotharius his other sonnes. Baldwin having espoused the daughter of Charles the Bald without his consent, in the end was acknowledged as Sonne

in law, to whom Charles gave the County of Flanders, and lost Aquitaine, whereupon Lewis caused himselfe to be Crowned King of Germany in the City of Sens, while Charles was entertained in Warres against the Normans: which he recovered Anno Domini 859, forcing his brother to retreate into Germany. Anno Dom. 863. they entered into a League. In the meane time there grew great troubles amongst the Nobility of France, by the meanes whereof the Bretons came as farre as Poitiers, whence they were chaced by Charles, and An. Dom. 863. they were constrained to take their Kingdome and Dutchy by faith of homage to him. And Anno Dom. 869. hee was elected King of Loraine by the death of his Nephew Lotharius. He was also crowned Emperor Anno Dom. 875. by the death of his Nephew Lewis, which hee enjoyed not above two yeares; in the end whereof being desirous to returne out of Italy into France, he was poisoned by his Physitian,

the sixth of October, Anno Dom. 877.
               The Reigne of this Prince was confused, and unhappy, and of small fame, being a King of no merit, for from the confusion in his reigne the fall of this Race did spring: But as Timanthes, when he drew Iphigenia ready to be sacrific'd, painted Calchas with a sad countenance, Ulysses sadder, and having spent all his Art in expressing Menelaus griefe, and not knowing how to make the Fathers countenance more sorrowfull, cover'd his head with a vaile, leaving his passion to be conceived by imagination: so this Kings Picture deserves to bee hidden and obscured with the vaile of silence: for it is better not to write at all, than to write, though justly, disgracefully of deceased Princes.

                  AFter the decease of Charles the Bald, Lewis surnamed the Stut, was heire and successor of his Father, declared himselfe not onely King of France Anno Dom. 877, causing himselfe to be crowned in a full assembly of Princes and Prelates at Rheimes, but

also Emperour of Rome. Aymoynus testifieth that hee was in some difference before his Coronation with the Primates of his Kingdome, because he had distributed the estates and dignities of France without their advice: Insomuch that he was enforced to give them content. In the meane time Pope John the 8. conceiving a better hope of the French, than of the Almaines, laboured what he could to reduce Italy into the good liking of Lewis the Stut, by the reason whereof he became an enemy of those that tooke part with Caroloman, Nephew to the said Lewis, and eldest sonne of Lewis, King of Eavaria, who tooke the Pope prisoner, whence hee made an escape by the meanes of his adherents, and retired himselfe into France with the Treasures of the Church, after that he had excommunicated his adversaries, who neverthelesse desisted not to detaine the City of Rome for the party of Caroloman. In the meane time the Pope was conducted

from Arles by Duke Boson to Lions; from whence he went to visite the King at Troyes, and there the King caused himselfe by him to be crowned with the Imperiall Diadem.
               After that the Pope was reconducted by Boson into Italy, whiles the Emperour Lewis went to visite Lewis King of Germany in Loraine, where they concluded a treaty of peace, for the which the controversie touching the Empire was deferred till another time, and it was agreed that the possession should rest as it did of that which each of them had in Italy, untill such time that it was otherwise agreed upon. Afterwards as the Emperour was in his journey with his forces to goe visite Bernard Marques of Gothland, or of Languedock, which had given an occasion to the Emperour to distrust his fidelity, hee was surprised at Troyes with a malady, which moved him upon hope of recovery to returne to Compaigne, where he deceased the tenth of April, An. Dom.

                  THis Lewis and Carlon or Caroloman, sonnes of Lewis the Stut, and of Ausgarde whom hee had taken to wife without the knowledge of his father, and after by his command divorced her, according to the Almaine Chronicles, were crowned Kings of

                  France, An. Dom. 879. according to the appointment of Lewis the Stut at his death to the Peeres of his Realme. Upon which occasion some Abbots and great Lords partializing against them, appealed Lewis King of Almany, to take charge of the affaires of France into his hands. To which purpose being arrived at Verdun, he was pacified with the part of the Kingdome of Loraine, which was given him, upon which he and his late Father had quarrelled with the Kings of France. This fire being thus quenched, another controversie grew concerning the County of Authun, betweene the Counts Theodoric, to whom it was given by the late deceased Emperour, and Boson, who layd a claime thereunto, to whom it was adjudged by Hugh the Abbot, upon condition that he should leave the Abbies with their revenues which were in those parts, to Theodoric.
               
               The State of France being thus troubled, Boson grew more turbulent, causing

himselfe to be crowned King of Burgundy, as also did the Normans, whom the Kings overthrew upon Saint Andrews day, Anno Dom. 879, slaying 5000. of them in the field. After in the yeare 880, they made a partage of the Kingdome of France, by which all the Neustrick France befell to Lewis, and Aquitan with Burgundy with the Marches to Caroloman. This being done, they went to surprise the Normans, whom they cut in peeces in the Carbonary Forrest, to the number of 9000, the yeare after he deceased. The Normans not desisting from wasting and sacking the Countrey of France, came up as farre as Paris. Carloman was enforced to buy a peace of them for 12. yeares, which he enjoyed not long, for in the yeare 884. he was slaine by a wild Boare a hunting, having reigned five or sixe yeares; or running after a Gentlewoman, his horse carried him away, and crush'd him under a gate, or at the Chace hee fell downe and broke his necke, for report differing

in the manner of his death, agrees that it was violent and accidentall.

                  THis Lewis surnamed the Lubber, or Doe-little, sonne of Carloman, succeeded in the Kingdome An. Dom. 885, at the pursuite of Hugh the Abbot, (who was so named, because as

it is thought, he was the first of the LayPrinces that usurped the revenues of the Abbies) so that all that part on this side Seine, and that which was called Neustry, remained in the obedience of Lewis the Doe little; and the parts beyond the Seine with Burgundy, were under Charles the grosse, Emperour; who came to take the protection of France against the Normans, according as Fulco, ArchBishop of Rheimes, testifieth. Therefore it is that they are placed in the Ranke and Catalogue of the Kings. In those times the Normans ranged about Neustry, sacking and spoyling the greatest part of Cities in those parts, namely, Rouen, Eureux, and Bayeux: but they were so soundly curryed by the valour of Hugh the Abbot, that in a long time after they durst not set a foote there, which was a cause that the same yeare 887. they returned to thunder upon the other parts of France, not sparing the Emperours Countrey, where they surprised the Castle of Lovanne.
                  
From thence they came before Paris under the conduct of their King Sigesroy, hoping there also to make a prey as they had done elsewhere; but it was so bravely defended by Count Eudes &amp; the Abbot Goslin, that they were quite frustrate of their expectation and pretence. This Lewis dyed immediately after, having borne the name of a King to his dying day, for the space of two yeares, according to the Chronicle of St. Benigne. Moreover, Charles became so stupefied in his senses and understanding, that when the Princes of the Empire knew that there was no hope of his recovery, and that the affaires of the Empire might fall into some disasters, they gave him into the charge of his Nephew Arnulph, naturall sonne of the late Caroloman, in whose custody he dyed soone after, on the 12. of January, Anno Dom. 888.
               This King was approved in the beginning of his Reigne, and reverenced by his Subjects, but afterwards having

made a dishonourable peace with the Normans, yeelding them Neustria, now called Normandy, hee lost his Subjects affection, and then through griefe and jealousie conceived against his Queene Richarda, fell sicke, and through the distemper of his body and minde being unfit to governe, was deposed, rejected both from the Realme and Empire, banished from the Court, and having neither house nor meanes, was starved, and dyed for want of reliefe in a poore Village of Suevia. Thus one of the great Monarchs of the world dyed without house, without bread, without honour, without mourning, &amp; without memory, but that his end was prodigiously memorable. The reasons were his imperious pride in prosperity, and his despairing dejectednesse in adversity, foolish extreames becomming not a magnanimous mind; therefore his affliction was hated of his subjects, not considering the true cause of his affliction. But the chiefe cause was his distrust

in God in his extremities, for he should have acknowledgd that

tooke the government of the affaires under the Title of King, and by the consent of Arnulph and the Lords of France: Hee was consecrated and annointed King, and crowned by Walter Arch-bishop of Sens, who was a cause that Baldwin, Count of Flanders, and Fulco Arch-bishop of Rheimes, sent Guy, Duke of Spoleto into Italy, to take the affaires of France into his hands. Odo being established, gave the County of Paris and of France to Count Robert his brother, and instituted Richard, Count of Authun, governour of the lower Burgundy, for the defence thereof against the Normans; who having beene Anno Domini 888. repulsed from before Paris by Count Robert, came before Sens: from whence they were beaten by the said Richard Duke of Burgundy, who was the first that left that dignity hereditary and patrimoniall to his successors. Walter, Nephew to Eudes, making an insurrection against him, betooke himselfe into Lygus, whence fetcht out,

he was put to death. At the same time Ebulo, Abbot of St. Germans, and Count Ranulph, together with his brother Gotsbert, arose against Eudes in Aquitaine, whom he made to goe against them. In the meane time the greatest part of the Lords of Neustria were in pursuite of Fulco, Arch-bishop of Rheimes, and of the Counts Heribert and Pepin the young, Charles the Simple, whom they caused to be crowned King in the City of Rheimes. Whereupon Eudes and he grew to great Warres, so that Charles the Simple would have entered into a confederacy of a Fleete of Normans under the conduct of Hastings for the recovery of his Kingdome, but he was prevented by Fulco, the Archbishop of Rheimes, because they were as yet Pagans. Fulco made peace betweene Eudes and Charles the Simple, Anno Domini 897, and by this reconciliation a part of the Kingdome was given to Charles, and the other permitted to Eudes, who enjoyed it not long

after, because he deceased without issue, the 13. of January, Anno 898, and at his death hee declared that of right the Crowne after him ought to returne to Charles the Simple, to whom it of equity and right appertained.
               From the Race of this Eudes sprung Hugh Capet, for Widechind of Saxony favour'd by Charle magne, sent his son Robert or Rupert into France, who had two sonnes, Eudes and Robert, Father to Hugh the great, Father to Hugh Capet, afterward King of France. Fame drew this Character of Eudes, that hee was a good wise man, yet he could not please the French by his Regency, for the excesse of his vertue curbing the desire of such as sought to raise their fortunes by usurping power over the State and the Kings weaknesse supported by Eudes, drew envy on his actions seeking the good of the Common-wealth, which hee neglected, but with approved resolution not abated l y private malice, went forward with the government

of the Realme, and at last resignes all his Authority to the King, who like Phaethon, unfit to rule the Chariot of the Sunne, by his bad government met those misfortunes, which Eudes kept off while hee lived; for Wisdome and Discretion is Scutum invincibile, an invincible Buckler, folly, envy, policy, treachery, slander, adversity, necessity, power and injustice, and all the Devills invisible Artillery cannot pierce nor wound him that is therewith arm'd.

                     CHarles surnamed the Simple, was estated in his Fathers Throne, Anno Dom. 898, and by the reason of his imbecillity every one encroched upon him, by making whatsoever passessions they held, as hereditary to their posterity, what belonged of

right to the Crowne: in so much that great dignities, Dutchies, Earledomes, and government of Provinces, which formerly were held but for terme of life in a titulary way, were now made hereditary. Anno Domini 912. he made a peace with Rollon, upon condition that the Countrey of Neustry, bounded by the River Epte on the one side, and by the Ocean on the other, should remaine to Rollon in Title of a Dutchy, to hold it in homage of the Crowne of France, conditionally also, that he and his whole Countrey should bee baptized in the Christian Faith. By reason whereof he was baptized Robert, after the name of his Kinsman Court Robert, from thence Normandy had its denomination. In those times also there were great troubles in France, which were raised by Robert brother to the former Odo, who had caused himselfe to bee crowned King by Herivee, Arch-bishop of Rheimes, whilst Charles was in Loraine; for the recovery whereof Charles led an

Army of Lorainers against Robert, whom he tooke at unawares neare to Soyssons. Notwithstanding this Robert resisted him valiantly, but with the losse of his life: The battaile neverthelesse was lost by Charles, who fled into Loraine. Whereupon the Allies of Robert called in Duke Rodulph of Burgundy, whom they caused to be crowned King at Soyssons for want of Hugh le Blanc, sonne of the late Robert, who by reason of his youth durst not pretend the Crowne.
               After this Charles staid not long to be entrapped in the snares of Hebert the Count, who sent by his Cousin Bernard, Count of Senlis to take him: so that he was detained prisoner in the City of St. Quintin, and afterwards was sent to the Castle of Thyerry upon the Marne, and from thence to Peronne, where he ended his life five yeares after his imprisonment, leaving Lewis in the power of his Mother Theargine, who for his safety conveyed him into

                  England. This King having resign'd his Crowne to Raoul his God-sonne, the first Prince of the blood by his Mother Hermingrade, Daughter to Lewis, and wife of Boson, King of Burgundy, dyed with griefe, and of a languishing Melancholy, to see that his treacherous vassage should so affront and oppose him, and use him in such a disgracefull manner. For there is no greater misery or vexation, than when the Master through want and poverty is abused by the man, it doth even astonish the minde, and pierce the Heart unto death; for Asperius nihil est humili cum surgit in altum.

                     ROdulph having beene crowned King at Soissons the 13. of June, Anno Dom. 923, reigned 13. yeares; hee went afterwards to warre with Hugh le Blanc against the Normans, others against those of the Faction of Rollon, and also those that inhabited

upon the River Loire: from whence he was recalled to receive the oath of the Lorainers, excepting that of Duke Gislebert and Rotharius, Arch-bishop of Treues. Afterwards having espoused Berthe, the Daughter of the Duke of Swede, and because having a hope to attaine the Empire, he passed into Italy, where hee overthrew Berengarius, and drove him out of Italy: and at his returne having made peace with the Normans, hee went against William Duke of Aquitaine, whom hee enforced to acknowledge his estate to have dependance from the Crowne. And upon the parting of Estates of the Kingdome, which was held at Attigny, hee had gone into Loraine, had hee not beene hindered by a fit of sicknesse, which retained him at Rheimes. After that he went against the Normans, but through the rebellion of the Lorainers, who had surrendred the upper Loraine into the power of the Emperour Henry, he was enforced to make peace with the

                  Normans, which continued not long, because having recommenced their wonted courses, he was constrained to purchase his peace with a great summe of monies, that hee might goe against the Duke of Aquitaine, who was now in rebellion, from whom hee tooke Nevers. The bruite of the Hungariáns comming into France, gave him to understand of the revolt of Count Heribert, who accompanying himselfe with Hugh le Blanc, went to take an Alliance with Henry the Emperour in Loraine, and in his returne released King Charles out of prison, who went to meete William Duke of Normandy, to enter a League against Rodulph. This beginning of Warres being pacified betweene them, Heribert caused Charles againe to be imprisoned, who dyed shortly after at Peronne.
               
               In those times there were great contentions amongst the Paires of France concerning the Provinces, which proceeded from the politick slights of the

Emperour, who sought to hold the partialities of France in an equality, for feare lest the tranquillity of France might not produce a trouble to his estate in Loraine. Rodulph deceased the twelfth or fifteenth day of January, Anno Domini 939.
               This Roul was an usurper, and his reigne was troublesome and unfortunate, and for hee and others, that had beene servants to the Crowne, being now Kings and Dukes, thought to make their Dominions proper to themselves, and not depending on the Crowne, which bred much confusion in France, Italy, and Germany. The Church did now strive to advance the Authority of the Pope of Rome, gaining a great opinion among Christians in the Empires declining estate, and growing so great a Monarch, that he assumed primacy above Kings and Emperours, which they and their subjects refused to acknowledge.
               In these times a young Maide attired

like a Boy, went with a learned man to Athens, and returned from thence so good a Scholler, being well read in many Authors of exquisite learning and profound knowledge, and so expert likewise in the holy Scriptures, that after the death of Pope Leo, shee was created Pope John the eight; but afterward being with childe by one of her Groomes, she was as shee went in solemne procession, (according to the custome and order observ'd amongst them) delivered of a childe in the open streete: Thus the Empire, the Realme, and the Church were in those times much distemper'd and disgraced, pride and ignorance breeding many miseries and reproachfull accidents.

City of Langres from Hugh le Noire, brother to King Rodulph, and having entertained the Lords of Burgundy before he came to Paris, hee discarded Hugh le Blanc, and for his owne Mother, that he might make use of her counsell: which caused Hugh to allye himselfe to the Emperour Otho, by taking his sister in marriage, and to reconcile Heribert. Afterwards they went to follow the King even into Burgundy, who in revenge fell upon Loraine, which caused the Emperour to depart out of Almaine to oppose him, but they made a peace betweene themselves. This notwithstanding, the King could not obtaine peace of his adversaries, untill the Dukes of Normandy, Aquitaine, and Bretagne being encouraged by Pope Stephen, embraced him, and they wrought so, that the Emperour accorded with the Princes Hugh &amp; Heribert, who awhile after that was taken by the King, and hanged, because he had imprisoned his Father, which so much

disturbed the repose of France, together with the death of William, Dukes of Normandy, who was murthered by the Count of Flanders, that Warres being enkindled over all France, the King was taken prisoner by the Normans, from being recovered by Hugh le Blanc, who delivered him to Count Thibaut, who detained him longer for the space of a yeare. The Emperour Othe seeing this, debated the cause of Hugh le Blanc, and began to maintaine the Kings so long, untill carrying himselfe indifferent, hee came to reape the fruite of both their ruines without any danger at all. In conclusion, this last Warre which had continued seven or eight yeares, being ended by an agreement betweene the King and Duke Hughes in the City of Soyssons, the King dyed of a strange malady in the Moneth of September, or according to others, the 12. of November, Anno Domini 954, after he had reigned about 19. yeares, leaving by his wife Gerberge Lotharius and

                  Charles. This King, (as it is formerly briefly mentioned) to revenge the death of his Father, whom Hebert Earle of Vermandois, had kept a prisoner in the Castle of Peronne untill hee there dyed, caused one in the habite of an Englishman, to come in haste to his Court at Landun, with Letters which himselfe had written, though fained to be sent from the King of England. The messenger being entred, and the Letters read softly to the King by his Secretary, the King smiled, and said; The Englishmen are not so wise as I estreem'd them to be: for our Cosin Harmant, King of England, hath signified unto me by these Letters, that in his Countrey a labouring man inviting his Master to dine at his house, caused him to be slaine, and now hee desires your counsell my Lords, what punishment this fellow hath deserved: Whereupon Thibaut, Earle of Bloys, said; that hee was worthy to be tortur'd, and then hang'd on a Gibbet: which sentence all

the Lords there present, and also Hebert Earle of Vermandois did confirme and allow: Whereupon the Kings Officers there provided in a readinesse, apprehended the said Hebert Earle of Vermandois, unto whom the King said, Hebert, this wicked Labourer is thy selfe, who didst put to death thy Lord and Master, King Charles my Father, for which thou hast condemned thy selfe to dye by thy owne judgment. Whereupon Hebert was hanged on a Gibbet on the top of a Mountaine neare Lodun, which since his Execution is called still Mount Hebert.
               
               This Lewis, (as was said) being nine yeares in England, was therefore surnamed D'entremer, or from beyond the Seas: Hee was disloyall and unfortunate, for though he endured much affliction, and many unkind fortunes, yet hee was not mended in his life by his sufferings, nor had learned to embrace Vertue, whose Beauty appeares most faire and comely,

when her eyes are fill'd with teares, making sorrow looke with a sweet and lovely countenance: It is that which in a Prince is most glorious, causing him to fixe his minde onely upon that which may prove beneficiall to the Church and State. But this was not the object wherein this Monarch was delighted, so that he was deprived of that excellency which by Vertue is attained. Besides he did degenerate from the blood of Charlemaine, for birth nor adversity did enlarge his narrow thoughts to take pleasure in noble actions: Hee came came unto the government after a long absence, which made his returne more gratefull to the Subjects, while his Enemies thought to creepe into his affection by the tender of fained service, especially William Duke of Normandy: thus Prosperity commands counterfeited offers of fidelity.
            
            
               
               
                  Lotharius, the 34. King of France. Anno 954.

                  THis Lotharius succeeded to the Crowne the 12. of November, Anno Domini 954. Hee gave Burgundy and Aquitaine to Duke Hughes, and would have made him Governour of Aquitaine: But Count William defending his right, shut the

Gates of Poitiers against him. Hughes deceased the 16. of June, Anno Domini 956, leaving Hughes Capet, Otho, Odo, and Henry, with whom the King fell into some differences concerning some Castles which he had seized from them. All which were appeased by Bruno Arch-bishop of Cologne, Unkle to the King, who was sent by the Emperour Otho. After this the King made an Assembly of the Princes and Prelates of France at Soissons, for the surprising of Richard Duke of Normandy, who plotted against the King, but he could not be found.
               In the meane time Arnulph the old Count of Flanders being dead, who before had made a donation of his Lands to King Lotharius, caused his body this yeare 965. to be transported into Flanders, thereby to receive the submissions of their fidelity. Lotharius Anno Domini 966. espoused Hemina or Emma, Daughter to Lotharius the 2. King of Italy, and Adeleide, Daughter

to the Emperour Otho, as also Matilde, Sister of this our Lotharius, was married unto Bernard King of Burgundy. Afterwards the King intending to make Warres upon Richard Duke of Normandy, at the instigation of Thibault Count of Chartres, was enforced to come to an agreement with him. A while after Lotharius wrought with Ranier and Lamhert, sonnes of the late Count of Monts in Haynaut, to make him a way for the re-entry upon the Kingdome of Loraine, which the Almaines detained from him: which was a cause that Otho, to cut off his designes, gave the Lower Loraine to Charles the brother of Lotharius, to bring him thereby into his disaffection. The King passed with his forces as farre as Aix, where he thought to have surprised the Emperour; who to requite him went before Paris, from whence hee was notably repulsed: whereupon they came to an accord, and Loraine continued to Charles, who then added to his Coate of Armes an Arme

proceeding out of the clouds. After the death of Otho, King Lotharius falls againe upon Loraine, which hee did not long enjoy, because hee dyed immediately after, Anno Domini 985.
               This Kings life was a meere blanke, wherein no brave actions were inscribed for the example of posterity, being a fruitlesse branch, and the first that grew out of his stock, excepting his sonne, who derived from him no sap of vertue, but was also barren in goodnesse: Hee did so contemne his brother Charles, whom his Father had left no portion, but his favour, thereby to increase his respect to his eldest brother, so that the Emperour, whose assistance hee desired, undertooke the quarrell. From whence this Note may be collected, that there is no depending on the favour of Kindred, who looke for much reverence, and will doe no justice in rewarding desert, which they rather contemne, untill Vertue despis'd breeds open hatred.
               But Charles ayded by the Emperour,

was undiscreete in his carriage, for the ayde received from the Emperour, made him to cleave too fast to the Germans, and disclaime the French, as if kindnesse had altered his nature, and this change drew on the justly conceived hatred of the French, and thereby overthrew his estate, by carrying too open a shew of disaffection for the wrong done by his brother, and righted by the Emperour. Lastly, (as we said) Lewis dyed, but the remembrance of his Reigne survived to his disgrace and ignominy in succeeding ages, leaving his sonne Charles to bee the last King of this second Race.

                  AFter the decease of Lotharius, Lewis the fift, his onely sonne, succeeded to the Crowne, Anno Domini 986, and was consecrated at Rheimes. The Continuator of Aimoynus writeth that he reigned nine yeares, as also another Chronicler call'd Hugh,
                  
is of the same opinion. Neverthelesse it may be proved by certaine testimonies that Lotharius dyed An. Dom. 985, to whom Lewis succeeded, and that Hugues Capet began not to reigne before the yeare 987, or 988, so that it appeares that this could not reigne above two yeares, and was enterred at S. Cornelius of Compeigne. Moreover, Glaber testifieth that Lewis married one Blanche which was brought him out of Aquitaine, who finding him not a man, left him, and retired into her Country; which makes a likelyhood of that which is written touching his death: moreover, that if she were Daughter to the Duke of Aquitaine, that she by consequence must be Niece to Hugues Capet. This Lewis dyed (as many are of opinion) in the same manner as his father did, by the meanes of his Wife Blanch, not leaving issue to succeed him. Odoramus gave him the surname of Doe nothing, because hee had no leasure to performe any thing memorable by the reason of

the brevity of his Reigne. Moreover, whilest Charles Duke of Loraine, was the next by right to succeede him, as being his Fathers brother; so is it that Hugues Capet, sonne of Hugues le Blanc tooke part against him, pretending that (as many do write) that Lewis had resigned the Crowne to him by testament and will. But others are of opinion, that he confiding to the power that hee had in France, and to the favour which the Nobility and the popularity of France did beare him, and through the discontent of having a Competitor who was exceedingly beloved and affected of the Almaines, and that he was too slow in gaining the succession of the Kingdome fallen to him, and through the ill will he bore him, because hee had married the Daughter of Hebert, Count of Troyes, encouraged him to contest against him for the Crowne.

                     HUgh Capet was proclaimed King at Noyan by the Princes, Barons, and Prelates of France, and afterwards annointed at Rheims the third of July, Anno Domini 987, where hee caused also his eldest sonne to be crowned King with him, named Robert▪
                  
                  
about halfe a yeare after, viz. on the first of January. The people, the souldiers, and all the Prelates swore a fealty to Capet against all men, and especially against Charles of Loraine, who came with an Army to challenge and stoutly make claime to his right by force of Armes in France, for the space of foure yeares, and first made himselfe sure of Laon by the meanes of Arnulph, naturall sonne to the late King Lotharius, whither Hugh went to assaile him: but hee made such a briske and valiant sally out against him, that hee shamefully routed both him and his. After having taken the Castle of Montagu, and pillaged the Territories of Soissons and Rheimes, he retreated to Laon, and the yeare following hee made himselfe Master &amp; possessor of Rheimes, through the intelligence which hee had with the said Arnulph, newly elected Arch-bishop of that See upon the decease of Albero. Whereupon Hugh using the same passages upon Charles, dealt under-hand

with Ascelin or Anselme, Bishop of Laon, who made a way for him and his Army into Laon, where Charles was taken, and carryed Prisoner to Orleans with Agnes his wife, by whom during the time of his imprisonment hee had two children, but all foure of them dyed prisoners. By this prize the Warres against Charles being ended, and the Cities of Laon and Rheimes retaken, yea, and the Dutchy of France being incorporated to the Domaines of the Crowne, and the City of Paris beginning againe to take upon it the name of a City Royall, Hugh caused a Synode to be held at Rheimes, whereby Arnulph was deposed, and Gilbert, Tutor to Robert the sonne of Hugh, was substituted in his place; whereof the Pope not content, caused a Councell to bee called in France, by the decree whereof Gilbert was dismissed, and Arnulph restored. Hugh deceased the 22. of November, Anno Dom. 996, and as others report, 998. He was funebrially inhumed

at St. Denis in France by his Ancestors.
               This King was the first of the Race of the succeeding Kings, being ordained to bring the Kingdome to a flourishing estate, by so many great and eminent vertues meeting in his Person: Hee was surnamed Capet, either from the bignesse of his Head, from the Latin word Capitosus, or because when hee was young, hee would plucke off his companions Capps, fore-shewing that hee should afterward pluck off Kings Crownes; for when matters were by policy and the affection of French advancing his desires fitly prepared, he got possession of the Crowne, though claimed by Charles, sonne to Lothaire, and with a complement of being unwilling to leave the Crowne to any particular Nobleman, least he should seeme to be preferr'd before the rest equall in desert, his sonne Robert propounded to their Election, was also crowned, being a wise and temperate

Prince, that gave much apparent hope of making the Kingdome happy in his fruitfull progeny, pledges of his vertues, some whereof were expressed in this saying: That he was a sonne without frowardnesse, a companion without jealousie, and a King without ambition; which was a sufficient testimony of the goodnesse of his disposition, and that he was wholly bent to those things which were truely honourable, applying his best helpe for maintaining the generall good of his Subjects, whereby he gained the love and obedience of all men; and afterward hee proved an exact Picture of his fathers great and perfect vertues.

                     RObert succeeded his Father Hugh, Anno Domini 996. Comming to the Crowne hee caused Melun to bee surrendered to Count Buchard, which Count Odo of Chartres, sonne of Berthe, sister of Raoul of Burgundy, had possessed. After the death

of his wife Lutgarde, he marryed Berthe the widow of Eudon, Count of Chartres, whom he after dismissed, because she was his Godmother; and tooke Constance, daughter of William, Count of Arles, and of Blanch, daughter of Foulques, Count of Aniou. At the same time Henry, Duke of Burgundy, Vncle by the Father to this Robert, dyed without heires. By reason whereof Otho Guillaume, surnamed the stranger, pretending a right to that Dutchy, by cause of the adoption which Henry had made of him, made himselfe very strong in Auxerre, which was taken from him by the King, with the Dutchy of Burgundy. Otho the sonne of Charles, Duke of Loraine being deceased, the Emperour Henry caused Count Godfrey of Ardenne to be invested, notwithstanding that Geberge and Hermengarde, Sisters of Otho, marryed to Lambert and Aubert Counts of Brabant and Namures, would have put them in possession; which was a cause that the King instigated

                  Baldwin Count of Flanders, against the Emperour, who siezed upon the Cities, which are upon the River of Escaut, as Valenciennes, Dinam, and others. Anno Domini 1015. the King tooke away the City and County of Sens from Count Ramard, surnamed the Wicked, by reason of the insolencies and violences committed upon the Arch-Bishop thereof, and was confiscated to the Crowne. Afterwards hee compelled the Burgundians to returne to their obedience, who Anno Domini 1016 were revolted: and after, having pacified the quarrell betweene Richard Duke of Normandy, and Odo Count of Chartres, who were in great warres, he went to treate with Henry the Emperour concerning matters of Religion, and their Dominions and Royalties, in a Parliament which they held together at Iovy upon Chere. And after having also appeased the quarrell betweene Eudes Count of Campagne and Chartres, and Foulque, Count of Aniou, hee

deceased at Melun, Anno Domini 1031. having reigned about three and thirty yeares, and lyes interred at St. Denis in France.
               
               This Robert in his whole Reigne exprest much wisedome; for as his father to settle the Crowne on his progeny, had caused him to be enstalled, so hee Crowned Hugh his eldest sonne at Campagne; and after his decease, preferring vertue before eldership, elected the yonger to be King, being of a more Royall disposition, and the Dutchy of Normandy was by Will left unto Robert.
               
               When hee had thus ordered his affaires, and pleased his Subjects with his happy reigne, having got enough Fame and Honour, he dyed, leaving him in the remembrance of Posterity, this opinion deepely setled: That the Kingdome was happy in his government, and blest in his wisedome, resolution, peaceablenesse, and continency, most eminent vertues, like Starres shining in

the Spheare of Majesty; but with a dimme brightnesse in respect of his piety, whence the other derived their borrowed light.
               In the praise of the holy Martyres he composed a Hymne, beginning thus: O constantia Martyrum mirabilis; and washighly pleased, that his wife, with whose name the former words had some agreement, had an humorous affection to approve his writings, then generally applauded.

But being come upon them by the ayde of the Duke of Normandy, he constrained his brother to content himselfe with the Dutchy of Burgundy. A while after Robert Duke of Normandy visiting the City of Jerusalem, dyed at Nice in Bithynia: by reason whereof Maugier, Arch-bishop of Rouen, and William Lord of Arques his brothers, maintaining themselves to be true Heires, raised great Warres against William the bastard-sonne of the said Duke, by him instituted to bee his Heire, which was a cause that the King sent the said William of Arques, accompanied with a great number of the Nobility of Normandy and France to the Warres of Italy: from whence they were recalled by George Maniaces, Lievtenant for the Emperour of Greece to Poville and Calabria, to employ them for the recovery of Sicily, which the Saracens had now possessed upon promise of giving them a part. About the yeare 1042, Thibault Count of

                  Chartres, and Stephen Count of Troyes, fell into a quarrell with the King Henry, whereupon hee first fell upon Stephen, whom hee in a Battaile overthrew. Afterwards hee deprived Galleran, Count of Meulan (who tooke their part) of all his lands, and annexed them to the Crowne, and encouraged Godfrey, surnamed Martel, to make Warre upon Thibault whom hee tooke prisoner, and enforced him to surrender up the Towne of Tours for his ransom.
               After this the King went to visite the Emperour Henry at Mets, where they confirmed the Alliance made betweene them, which hee broke by supporting Thibault against the King, who following the example of his Father, resigned his Crowne to his eldest sonne Philip, Anno Dom. 1059, being aged 7. yeares, and caused him to bee crowned at Rheimes the 29. of May the same yeare: the yeare following King Henry deceased, leaving the young King and another sonne named Hugues, under the

tuition of Baldwin, Count of Flanders. He lyes at St. Denis.
               
               This Kings reigne was somewhat troubled at the beginning to maintaine his Title to the Crowne, given him by his Father, but belonging of right to his eldest brother, which bred swelling thoughts betweene the brethren, the Mother maintaining the elders right. An Army was prepared to end the difference, whether the Fathers gift, or right of inheritance were a better Title; but the cause was tryed by the Sword, for Robert, whose right was then in question, content with tame patience to loose it, and so prevent the effusion of blood, by his milde disposition doing himselfe injustice. Whereupon agreement being made betweene Henry and Robert, the Armies returned, and peace was betweene the brothers concluded. Afterward when hee following therein his Fathers example, had seene his son firmely seated in the Throne, Death discovered the love of his Subjects, exprest

in their mourning for his decease, and was most honourably interred with the rest of his Predecessors, having all the funerall Rites and Ceremonies which belonged to so high a Monarch, to set forth the excellency of his Person. His Reigne begun with some blustering troubles, being opposed on every side, which soone ended, and his subjects felt the beames of favour shining most gently on them, when this Sunne of Majesty was ready to descend and set, which gave them great cause of lamentation and sorrow for his departure out of this world.

                     PHilip succeeded his Father Henry Anno Domini 1060, of whom Baldwin, Count of Flanders, tooke charge in regard of his tender infancy, untill he came to riper yeares:

He perceiving that the Gascognes would mutinie, led his forces against them, under pretence of going against the Saracens, and by this meanes hee dissipated the beginning of the seditions which were pullulating. A while after Edward King of England dyed without issue, having by will instituted William Duke of Normandy, heire and successor to his Crowne, which in vaine was opposed by Harald sonne of Godwin, because he was slaine in a battaile which William gave him. Baldwin, Regent of France, deceased about the yeare 1067, leaving the County of Flanders to Baldwin of Monts his eldest sonne; at which times King Philip might be at the age of 15. or 16. yeares. He marryed Berthe, Daughter of the said Baldwin, by whom having two children he divorced her, and betooke himselfe to the Wife of Foulques, Count of Aniou, whom in the end he dismissed, and returned to Berthe. Anno Domini 1095. Pope Urban convocated a Councell in

                  November at Clermont en Auvergne, wherein the Pope upon the complaint of the Patriarch of Jerusalem, and Peter the Hermite excited the greatest part of the Princes of France, of whom were principall, Hugh the Great, brother to King Philip; Robert Duke of Normandy, brother to the King of England; Godfrey of Bovillon, (who in the yeare 1089, had the Dutchy of Loraine given him) with his two brothers Baldwin and Eustachius, together with the Counts of Flanders and Tholouze, of Bourges and Bloys, to goe to Jerusalem, which was taken in the yeare of our Lord, 1099, the 15. of July, and was given to Godfrey of Loraine, to defend and keepe it as Governour under the Title of a King. After that hee tooke in Palestine, after having slaine above five thousand Aegyptians in a battaile, and seized upon the Port of Jasse, making hereby an end of the Warre. Philip at the age of 57, deceased at Melun the 25. of July, Anno Dom. 1109,

and lyeth interred at St. Benets upon the Loire. William the bastard Duke of Normandy, having beene long sick of a great swelling in his belly, this King Philip intending to make Warre against him, sent him word that hee had laine long in Child-bed, and that if he might know of his uprising, hee would provide lights against his Churching. To which scoffe the Duke return'd this answer; That hee would come in person into ▪
                  France, and have a solemne Masse sung at his Churching, and that for Lights, he would provide a thousand woodden Torches without waxe, and a thousand Lances tipt with steele to fire those Torches, meaning by the Torches, Houses, Townes, and Villages; by the Lances, Souldiers to set them on fire.
               The dissention betwixt England began in this Kings reigne, and upon this occasion: VVilliam the Conquerors sonnes, Robert and Henry, came to the King at Conflans upon Oise, and

playing there at Chesse with Lewis King Philips sonne, the young Princes fell out, and words drew on blows, for Lewis called Henry the sonne of a Bastard, and Henry strooke at him with the Chesse-boord, and had slaine him if Robert had not stayd his fury. Afterward Robert and Henry fled into Normandy, where they complained of wrong, and incensed many to take their part. Afterward naturall affection made the Fathers embrace their Childrens quarrell, invading one anothers Territories, and maintaining hot warres. But to conclude, the memorable Warre undertaken to recover the Holy-land from the Saracens, was now begun under the conduct of Godfrey of Bologne, who being chosen King of Jerusalem, refused the Diadem, saying, It is not fit for any Christian Prince to weare a Crowne of Gold, since Jesus Christ, the King of Kings, did weare one made of Thornes.

                  THis Lewis the Grosse succeeded to the Crowne after Henry his Father, and was solemnly Crowned at Orleans by Gislebert, Arch-Bishop of Sens, Anno Domini 1109. He first beganne to quell the pride and power of the great Lords of France,
                  
who countenanced by the King of England, arose up against him: but in the end he accomplished his designes. In those times the Englishmen moved their first warres upon the French, in the behalfe of Count Thibault of Campagne and Bloys. But the King in revenge commanded William the sonne of Robert Duke of Normandy, and sent him, accompanyed with Baldwin, Count of Flanders, and Foulques, Count of Aniou, with an army to surprise them; whereupon there was a peace made betweene them and the English, to quit Gisors to William the sonne of Henry. Baldwin Count of Flanders, being wounded in the Conquest of Normandy, went to end his life in Flanders; who for want of issue instituted Charles, son of Canutus, King of Denmark, to bee his heire. In the meane time the King being advertised that the Emperour came in aide of the English, prevented his designe, and forced him to retreate. He forced also the Count of Auvergne,
                  
and the Vicount of Polignac, to give satisfaction to the Bishop of Clermon; and at his returne he notified to William Duke of Aquitaine, that onely Avergne but also Aquitaine were in tenure of the Crowne of France. The County of Flanders was in question betweene Arnulph the Dane, Baldwin Count of Haynaut, and William of Ipres, by the death of Charles, who was slaine in S. Donatus, in Bruges; and by the King it was adjudged to Robert Duke of Normandy, by right of consanguinity; whereupon warres ensued. After that the King caused his sonne Philip to be Crowned at Rheimes, the fourteenth day of April, 1129. the King of England being in presence; but two yeares after hee dyed, by meanes of a Hogge that came under his Horse feete, and frighted the Horse, that hee threw him on the ground. Lewis his brother was Crowned in his place by Pope Jnnocent, the five and twentieth of October. 1131.

                  Lewis the Grosse deceased at Paris, Anno Dom. 1137. leaving sixe Children.
               
                  Baldwin, Earle of Mons in Henault, complaining unto Lewis the Grosse, that he had wrongfully given the Earledom of Flanders, which was his right, unto Duke William of Normandy, and desiring to have leave granted to maintaine his Title by Combate. The King said, You must combat then against me; for the Seignory which you claime is my right and inheritance. This King also in a Battaile, being severed from his Souldiers, was likely to be taken Prisoner by an English Knight, who laying hold on the raines of his Horse, cryed aloud, The King is taken: whereupon the King valiantly kild the Knight, and as he fell downe, said: One man alone cannot in Chesse play, give the King the Mate.
               At a certaine siege, being forsaken of his Souldiers, in regard of the unseasonablenesse of the weather, and

constrained to retire, hee said with a brave kind of anger; That an honest and honourable death was better than a shamefull and dishonourable life. The last action of his reigne was the marrying of his sonne unto the daughter and heire of William Duke of Normandy; by this allyance to settle a more firme peace, and make his sonne strong in friends, while his younger sons were compelled to depend on the meere favour of their elder brother; on whom the estate being setled, they might therby hee instructed to shew unto him a willing obedience; for equality breeds discord and grumbling; but an acknowledged dependance on another procures respect; for necessity makes brave minds glad to be oblieged.

                  THis Lewis undertooke the government the same Moneth wherein his Father dyed, and marryed Elianor, the onely daughter of William Duke of Guienne, and Poictou. Afterwards hee made warre

upon the Count of Vermendois, because following the censures of the Pope, hee repudiated Peronelle, sister to Queene Elianor, that he might re-entertaine his former wife, whom before he had divorced. And taking the Towne of Vitry, in Parthois, hee put to the sword and fire more than 3500 persons: for the expiation of which fact, St. Bernard advised him to make a voyage with his Army into the Holy Land, for the succour of Palestine. Whither hee arriving with his army, he had but an ill trick put upon him by the Emperour of Greece: Moreover, perceiving his Army much affoibled by the assaults of the Turkes, he saved himselfe in the towne of Attalia, and came to Antioch, where the King conceived a great distaste against his Wife, who had accompanyed him all that voiage. Afterwards he joyned forces with Conradus the Emperor, for the beleaguering of Damietta. But that siege tooke no effect, through the envy of the old Christians there, conceived

against the new-commers; which was a cause that the Emperour, and the King retreated each to his owne home, where the King was in danger to have bin surprised by the Emperour of Greece; but he was rescued by George, Lievtenant of the King of Sicily. The King upon his returne divorced his Wife, who married with Henry Count of Aniou, and Normandy, who should succeede to the Crowne of England, bearing with him the Counties Poictou and Aquitaine. Afterwards the King took to wife Constance, the daughter of Alphonsus, King of Castile, who being deceased he tooke Adele, or Ale, (alias) Alice, daughter of the Count of Champagne, by whom, An. Dom. 1165. he had a sonne named Philip, and surnamed Deodoctus: to whom, the King growne aged, resigned his Crowne, notwithstanding hee was but 14. yeares of age, and was Crowned at Rheimes, An. Dom. 1179. King Lewis deceased the 19. or the 29. of September; although some report upon the 29. of

the same Moneth, or August, An. Dom. 1180. Hee lyes interred in the Abby of St. Barbeau, which hee had formerly built.
               In his reigne the Holy Land, which the Christians had taken, seemed to bee utterly conquered, remaining under the Christians obedience, untill the unhappy death of Godfrey of Bouillon; for when the Commander was gone, whose unspicious good fortune put life into this action, the Warre did not prosper, yet before his death he encountred an Army of sixe thousand men, which the Turkes had brought into Palestine, and came off with very good successe, and had so proceeded, if his Death had not prevented, the good fortune of Christendome. For the name of so great a Warrier conducting an Army, prepares the way for conquest, as opinion of victory; and learning is a great Engine in policy to bring about matters. This King lost some reputation by his unchast Wife

                  Elenor, who following him to the Holy Land, blotted her Fame with a sensuall imputation, loving Saladin a Iester better than the King her Husband; thereby shewing that lust is base, and doth not regard either birth or honour. Yet Lewis (shewing the vertuousnesse of his minde, and Noblenesse of disposition) brought her backe in his owne Ship, because he would not bee derided by any forraigne Prince: but beeing safely landed, he was much opprest with griefe, in stead of casting her in the River, which she had deserv'd, he covered her shame and his owne by a divorce granted by a general counsell, punishing her by shewing too much mercy, while hee sought onely to be freed from the disgrace.

                  AFter the decease of Lewis 7, Philip 2. succeeded to the Kingdome Anno Domini 1180, out of which he chased the Jewes then there, and by his prowesse and conquests acquired the name of Augustus and Conquerour. He married Isabelle (or) Alice,
                  
Daughter of Baldwin 4, Count of Flanders, in favour of which Marriage hee resigned the County of Artois: but afterwards taking upon him the cause of Lionor the Inheritrix of Elizabeth, (or) Mabel, Countesse of Flanders, in the Counties of Vermandois and Valois, against the Count Flamend, who layd claime to the said Counties, as being of the ancient stocke of Flanders, hee tooke onely that of Vermandois, leaving that of Valois to the said Flamend, whereupon he being in an indignation, went and performed homage to the King of Germany, the eldest sonne of the Emperour, for the County of Flanders. Richard also, Duke of Aquitaine, second sonne of the King of England, began to dis-acknowledge the King: whereupon the King made warre against him, and tooke some Townes from him; but they were immediately accorded by the Popes Legate, by whose perswasion they entred a League upon an expedition for the Holy-land. But

this agreement was incontinently broken upon new differences which happened betweene the Kings of England and France; during which, the King tooke into his possession the Counties of Mans and Tours, whereupon King Henry of England tooke a conceite, and dyed in the Castle of Chinon: whereupon Richard his sonne undertaking the Kingdome, marryed Adele Sister to King Philip, and they both went to the Holy Land: where arriving they tooke the Towne of Acre the twelfth of July, 1191. After, upon some jealousies conceived betweene them, Philip returned into France, leaving the charge of his Army to the Duke of Burgundy. And because Philip, Count of Flanders was deceased, the King retained to himselfe the County of Artois, which hee gave to Prince Lewis. Whereupon England made warres against him, which were ended by the death of Richard; to whom John being substituted, and losing the battaile at

                  Bonnivel, the King caused his sonne Lewis to be proclaimed King of England, which hee afterwards left to Henry the sonne of John. After that King Philip sent his sonne Lewis against the Albigeois, and as the said Philip held a Parliament at Nantes, he deceased of a Feaver, in the 43. yeare of his Reigne, in tbe Moneth of July, Anno Domini 1223.
               This King being to joyne battaile with the Emperour Otho, having caused a gilt Bowle to be filled with Wine and sopps of bread, hee said; Princes and Lords of France, heere with me assembled, let every one that is resolv'd to live and dye with me this day, shew his resolution by taking a sop out of the Bowle of Wine, and eating it as I have done: which words being spoken, the Cup was presently emptied, and afterward the battell being joyned, the King got the victory. Being informed by his Courtiers that some Royall Jurisdictions belonging to the Crowne

were usurped by the Clergy, his answer was, I had rather connive at some petty injuries, than commence Suits against the Semitears of God and his Church. This King having put away his Queene Gelberge, the King of Denmarke complained to the Pope of this wrong done to his Sister, and a day of hearing was appointed before the Popes Legate in the Bishops Hall at Paris: Philips Case was well defended by his Advocates, but when none appeared to plead for the Queene, a young man unknowne steps forth of the presse, and demands audience; and having deliver'd the truth, and pleaded against the King for the Queene, and when his Speech was ended, hee returned into the presse againe, and was never seene more, neither was it ever knowne from whence he came. The amazed Judges remitted the Cause to the Councell, and King Philip did ride presently to Bois de Vinennes, where Gelberge was confined, and having embrac'd her, receiv'd her

into favour, and lived with her afterward in nuptiall love. And heereby it may bee discerned, that no man can bring Nature to any perfection, for this worthy Prince was much troubled in minde, and divided in his thoughts by loving this Gelberge, whom he could not forsake, for she had got such strong possession in his affection, that he could not turne her remembrance out of his heart, pass'd away to her by deed of gift. Thus hee that could overcome his Enemies, could not conquer his passions. He reigned 44. yeares, and by his vertue governed the State with such wisedome, that all his troubles had a happy faire end; from whence this conclusion may be drawne, That a vertuous King is in the end happy, howsoever hee bee compassed in with difficulties.

                     LEwis, the eldest sonne of Philip, succeeded to the Crowne, Anno Domini 1223. Hee, together with his wife Blanch, sister to the King of Castile, was Crowned at Rheimes, the 6. of August, to whom afterwards the Surname of Montpensier was given, because

he dyed there: In the beginning of his reigne, he renewed the ancient consideration and allyance which was betweene France and Almany, and upon his returne he led his Army into Guienne; where in a set battaile he overthrew the English, whereof Savary of Maleon had the command: by meanes whereof the French tooke the townes of Niot, S. John D' Angely, and Rochelle, leaving nothing of the Countrey of Guienne, on this side the River Garonne, unreduced to the obedience of the King. Insomuch, that all the Lords as well of Poicton, as Lymosin, and Perigort, came to sweare him fealty and obedience. Amaury also, sonne to the Count of Montfort, came to resigne into the hands of the King of France the right which his Father had left him in the Countries of Alby, Languedoc, Agenois, Quercy, and the County of Tholouze, whom in recompence he made his Constable, knowing him to be a man capable of such a charge. The yeare following

                  Richard, Brother to the King of England, besieged Rochelle; but hearing of the comming of the French Army, he passed over Dardonne with his forces, and so into England to his brother. The yeare following, the King, with the greatest part of his Nobility, upon the encouragement of the Popes Legate, addressed himselfe to goe against the Albigenses and Tholosans, to encounter whom, he led his Army, and encamped on Witsun Eve, before Avignon, which he tooke: passing further, hee received the keyes of all the Townes, Places, and Castles of Languedoc, as farre as within foure leagues of Tholouze: where, through the incommodity of the winter, and maladies which much weakned his Army, he retreated and wintered in France, with an intent of returning thither the Spring following to accomplish his enterprize. But his death prevented him at Montpensier in Avergne; the twelfth day of November, 1226. leaving Lewis, Charles,
                  
                  Alphonse, and Robert his sonnes, all very young, and in their minority of yeares.
               This King reigned but three yeares, in whom Vice had struck no reproach, nor Vertue had made him famous; whereby it seemes that his minde was of a middle temper, not so poore as to become impious or wicked, nor so well bent and enclined to noble actions, that hee would strive to get Fame by his owne vertue; therefore he was onely famous in this, That hee was Sonne to an excellent Father, and Father to an excellent sonne.
               In his reigne the Counsell of Lateran was assembled, whither resorted all the chiefe Bishops of Christendome, and Embassadours sent from Kings and Princes.
               After Lewis had subdued the Albigeois, and left Governour to suppresse any rebellion which should happen, for the affection of conquerd people is treacherous, who doe watch only an opportunity

to revolt; hee came to Mount Pensier, in the yeare 1225. October the seventh, and there resigned his life and Scepter, leaving a faire progeny, having foure sonnes, who were flourishing Branches of the Royall stemme, the eldest whereof was heire unto his Fathers Crowne, but inherited more vertue than his Father gave him by naturall discent. The Flemings were now much disquieted by an Imposture, pretending that he was their Prince; some were drawne to beleeve his claime, untill by putting him to death the people were better satisfied, and cleerely discerned that his right was meere fixion, maintained by boldnesse, as that Scene was, wherein Parkin Werbecke in England plaid the same part.

                  THis Lewis the 9. at the age of 12. yeares, succeeded his Father, An. Dom. 1226. Hee was consecrated at Rheims by the Arch-bishop of Sens in the absence of him of Rheims. Blanch taking of possession of her sonne Lewis, confirmed herselfe Regent of

the Kingdome with the consent of the States: whereupon the Princes in a rage proclaimed Philip Count of Bologne, Unkle to the King by the Fathers side, Regent of France, which was a cause of great dissentions. Shee brought through the sweetnesse of her words, Robert Count of Dreux into the Kings obedience. But the Duke of Bretagne, and the Count of Champagne, with the King of England, were enforced to acknowledge the King, on condition that the Breton should doe homage to the King for his Dutchy, whereupon he was surnamed Mauclarke. Hee having out-growne his minority, Anno Dom. 1234. espoused Magaret the eldest Daughter of Raymund Berenger, Count of Provence, and after erected the Countrey of Artois into a County or Earledome, which he gave to his brother Robert, who was the first Earle thereof. Hee made a voyage into the Holy Land, where he tooke Damietta after hee had overthrowne the Mamelucks:
                  
and from thence marching to beleaguer Massaure, the plague grew amongst his Army, which caused the Soldan of Aegypt to charge him so strongly, that he was taken, and most of his Army slaine, neverthelesse hee was freed upon the re-delivery of Damietta.
               
               About that time Blanch, Mother to the King, deceased, which caused the King immediately to returne into France, after he had composed all matters in Palestine. Being returned, hee studied to polish and embellish his Kingdome with good and holy Lawes. Hee made an accord with the King of England, who by that renounced all the right which hee pretended to the Kingdome of France, and the Dutchy of Normandy. About that time Charles, brother to the King, conquered both the Sicilyes, whereof hee was crowned King, An. Dom. 1266. The King Lewis made a second voyage for the recovery of the Holy Land, together with the

King of England. Hee went first into Africke, where he tooke Carthage, and at the siege of Tunes hee departed this life, Anno Domini 1270. Hee was canonized after his death for the holinesse of his life. Hee founded the holy Chappell at the Palace at Paris, wherein he placed many holy Reliques.
               This King being asked by his Lords what Title of honour he would assume, as the Roman Emperours and Kings of France in remembrance of their Acts and Victories had formerly done, hee answered, My greatest victory was obtained against the Devill, when I was baptized in the Church of Poissi: and therefore it shall be my greatest honour to be called Lewis of Poissi. His familiar Letters, wherein hee did not entitle himselfe King of France, but Lewis of Poissi, being blamed by a private friend, hee said, I am like a Twelfe-tide King, chosen with a Beane, and keeping his Feast in the Evening: intimating thereby his Election to another Crowne in

the Kingdome of Heaven, which second Coronation should be in the Evening and end of his life. Having caused a swearer and blasphemer to be branded on the lips with a hot Iron, whereat the people murmur'd: he said he would undergoe the same punishment, conditionally that oaths and blasphemies might be no more used in his kingdom. He sitting in Counsell, or beginning any action, would accordign to his Mothers instruction in his infancy, blesse himselfe with the signe of the Crosse. And lastly, he gave unto his son Philip these instructions at his death. My Sonne, love God with all thy heart, with all thy strength, and with all thy soule; offend not God in any case, suffer any torment rather than sinne: Beare all adversity patiently, acknowledging that God hath sent it unto thee deservedly: Make thy Confession often to some Minister of the Church; heare diligently the divine service sung in the Church of God: Keepe the good customes of thy Kingdome
                  
                  carefully, abolishing those which are evill: Impose no Taxes on thy Subjects, but upon great occasion. Favour those that feare GOD, love Justice, and hate Covetousnesse: Let not thy Judges be impartiall against thy Subjects: Keepe the Cities and Townes gotten by thy Predecessors; preferre good and sufficient men to Benefices and Offices: Be an Example to thy Subjects, moderate the expences of thy Court, and so God blesse thee. These were the good instructions which this godly Monarch gave unto his Sonne for the leading of an upright life, and to abandon all worldly delights and pleasures, so as hee might both please God, and be a patterne to his inferiours.

                  AFter the decease of S. Lewis, Philip the third, surnamed the Hardy, his eldest sonne, having beene proclaimed King in the Campe before Tunis in Africk tooke his journey in his returne through Italy, directly to Viterbe, to make an agreement betweene

the Cardinals, who in two years space were in a dissention upon the Election of a Pope. Hee was Crowned at Rheimes by the Bishop of Soissons, the thirtieth of August, Anno Dom. 1271. He after incorporated the County of Tholouse to the Crowne, upon the decease of the Count Alphonse his uncle. He went to aide Gerard of Cassebonne, his Subjects, against the Counts of Armigna and Foix, by reason whereof, the Count of Foix submitted himselfe to his mercy. He restored the Countrey of Navarre to the obedience of Ioane, daughter of the late Henry King of Navarre deceased. The King marryed Mary, the daughter of Henry Duke of Brabant, who was suspected to have poysoned Lewis, the eldest sonne of the King, by his first wife Isabelle of Aragon: She was found innocent by the report of two Bishops who were sent to a Nunne, or rather a Sorceresse, to know the truth. The yeare after Peter De la Bresche, great Chamberlaine of

                  France, and superintendant of the Finances, and affaires of the King, was hanged, being accused and convicted, for having discovered the secrets of France to the King of Spaine, together with the death of the Kings sonne. Anno Domini 1282. the Sicilian Evensong were executed upon the Frenchmen, upon an Easter day, or (as others report) on the thirtieth of March, or thirteenth of April: whereupon Charles, Uncle to the King, offered battaile to Peter of Aragon, the author thereof, but he refused it. Afterwards the King having caused Ioane, the onely daughter of the late Henry, King of Navarre, to be marryed to his eldest sonne Phillip, he marched with his Army for the Conquest of Aragon, which by the Pope had been given to Charles de valois, the second sonne of Philip, who conquered the County of Russillon; after that the City of Gennes. And after that, having in an Embuscado slaine the King of Aragon, he forced the Towne of Gironne
                  
to be yeelded up. He went to conclude his Fate at the Towne of Perpignan, of a Malady which surprised him in his Campe, Anno Domini 1285. the 6. of October.
               
               This King, as it appeares in the whole course of his life, would engage himselfe in all businesses, and was therefore called the Hardy; but his desperate Father would not undertake his Neighbours quarrells, nor seek to make betwene them any agreement, unlesse it might be done by safe and quiet means. The reigne of this King was much disturbed by the warres maintained by Peter and Roger for the Isle of Sicily, and after much effusion of blood, Charles dyed, and also Peter, though politicke, could not deceive death, but having received a great overthrow, concluded his Act of life with griefe and sorrow. At last this King was by Roger, Admirall of Arragon, friend unto Peter set upon him, lying sicke a bed at Pepignan; yet in extreamity he exprest a noble courage,

and with his sicke weake voyce so encouraged his Souldiers, that Roger was droven out of Pepignan, the City held by Philip so distempered with this alarum, that he grew sicke and dyed the fifteenth of October, two moneths after Peter, Pope Martin the fourth dying the same yeare, 1286. to shew great Princes, that their chiefe designes are crost by death.
               It was now decreed in a Counsell at Lions, that the Cardinals meeting after the Popes death, should not come out of that Conolme untill they had chosen the Pope, which begun upon occasion of the tedious Election of the former Pope, and the Decree is still observed. Thomas Aquinas now dyed, being a subtile disputer: But Bonaventure, John Duns, called Scot, and Gabriel Biel succeeded, and were famous schollers.
               And to conclude, hee was a Prince borne for a testimony to that obscure age, and for corrupted times, to bee a patterne to all Kings and Princes of religion,

equity, clemency, wisedome, valour, magnanimity, patience, and constancy: to love piety, justice, order and peace, to joyne the love of sanctity and modesty of manners, with Armes and State. Having shewed that it is very fitting for a King to be a good Christian, a good warriour, a good husband, a good father, a good governour, a good Iustier, and to know how to make war and peace. That it is very necessary to joyne unto the Majesty Royall, piety, clemency, and authority to gaine the low respect and obedience. And lastly, that the best guard, and most assured revenew of a Prince, is the love of his Subjects. Thus he was worthy of that venerable name, wherewith posterity hath justly honourd him, being the Honour of vertue.

                     PHilip 4. surnaming himselfe The Faire, King of Navarre, succeeded his Father, An. Dom. 1286. After that he had withdrawne his Army from Parpignan, hee was crowned at Rheims the sixt of January. He caused the Palace to be built at Paris: at that

time Edward, King of England, pretending to lead his Army to the aide of the Towne of Acre, which the Saracens had now beleaguered, made some incursions upon the Sea-townes of Normandy, thinking to have surprised Rochell: whereupon ensued the second Warre which the French had against the English, (Heere the French Writers shew themselves most shamefully partiall and false, yet I am bound to follow my Authors, they being of that Nation) who notwithstanding their alliance with the Emperour Adolphus, were valiantly repulsed as well by Charles of Valois, where the Lord of St. John was taken; as by Robert of Artois, who gained the victory upon the fresh Army, which Edmund, brother to the King of England, had led to Bayonne: yea, and the Count of Flanders, who declared himselfe on the English party, lost the battaile at Furnes against the Count of Artois, who went to joyne forces with the French who besieged Lisle; and the

Lords of Mont Morency and Harcourt tooke the Towne of Dover. The English perceiving that, demanded a Truce, which was converted to a peace, by the Marriage of Madam Marguerite of France, Daughter of King Philip, with the King of England.
               
               Afterwards the Emperour Albert and this King made an accord betweene them for the conservation of their kingdomes against all men. A while after, the Pope being much moved against the King, sent a Bull into France by the Arch-bishop of Narbona, interdicting the King, which Bull was burnt in the Court of the Palace. At that time the Flemings slew all the French Garrisons; whereupon the King being enraged, sent his Army to Courtrac, which was by them defeated. Whilest the King sent the Lords, Tarra a Colonian, and Nogareth with 2000. Horse into Italy, they put the Pope in such a terrour, that he dyed: The King also tooke such a revenge upon the Flemings neare to the

Mount of Poville, that hee overthrew 36000. of them. After that, the King having suppressed the Knights Templars, and causing James de Moulay or Beavieu, Generall of that Order, deceased at Fontainebleau, An. Dom. 1314, and lyes inhumed at St. Denis.
               
               This King being perswaded to take revenge on a Bishop who had underhand strooke fire to kindle the tindar of contention betweene him and the Pope, he said: That it was more noble in a Prince to save, than kill; to pardon, than to persecute; and to forgive and remit, rather than to revenge: for saith he, It must be of necessity that all things which angry men doe, must needs be full of blindnesse and necessity, because it is no easie matter for a man troubled with envy, to have the use of Reason; and whatsoever is without Reason, is without Art. It behooveth us therefore to take reason as our guide in all our actions, and to remove these passions of envy and revenge, for they

ought not to rest in a wise mans breast: Yet he was much affronted by Pope Boniface, cōmanding him by his Bull to succour the Tartar, which the King, engaged in many affaires, refusing to doe, the Bishop sent by the Pope, told him: That if the King would not obey the Pope, he would deprive him of his Realme. But afterward two Gentlemen imployed by the King, seized on the Pope in his Palace-Hall at Anagma, and carryed him to Rome, where he grew mad, and dyed Thirty five dayes after hee was taken, and had this Epitaph made by common Fame in his disgrace: Hee entred his Topedome like a Foxe, hee reigned like a Lyon, and dyed like a Dogge.

                  THis Lewis the tenth, already by his Mother King of Navarre, Count of Brye, and Champagne, succeeded his Father, Anno Domini 1315. His Kingdome from the beginning was marvellously troubled with

mutinies and popular seditions; and for that cause he was surnamed Hutin, which in old language imports mutiny and quarrells. Enguran De Marigny Count of Longue Ville, was accused before the King, by Charles of Valois, the Kings Vncle, for having ill governed the Finances, charged the people with many impositions and taxes, and infinite confusions; also for having taken money of the Flemings to grant them a peace to the disadvantage of the King: wherefore he was hanged upon the Gallowes of Paris, which himselfe had caused to be built.
               Afterwards the King caused himselfe to bee annoynted, and Crowned at Rheimes, upon the Feast of the Assumption of the B. Virgin: then he led his Army against the Flemings, whom he forced to raise and forsake the siege of L'Isle. And at his returne he seated the Court of Parliament at Paris, to the end, that the pleaders should not be anymore incommodated by so often removing

it. The yeare following the Count of Flanders came to visite the King at Pontoise, to treat of a peace with him. In the interim, Lewis Count of Navers, his sonne, would sieze upon Flanders, if the Flemings would have beene content therewith, which was a cause that his Father returned after that hee had promised the King to ratifie to the Flemings that which he had treated with him. Vpon this the King was surprised with a Malady at Bois De Vincennes, whereof he died the fifteenth of Iune, in the eighteenth moneth of his reigne, leaving his second wife Clemence great with Childe, who was delivered of a sonne the foureteenth of November, who was baptised Iohn, who lived above eight dayes, there remaining none of his Line, but Ioane, whom he had by his first wife, the daughter of Robert Duke of Burgundy: by whom, Eudes, Duke of Burgundy, her Vncle, would lay claime to the Crowne: but Philip the Tall, brother to the late King
                  
                  Lewis, opposing the Lawes and Customes of France, in right of his Neece caused the Crowne to be adjudged unto him.
               
                  Lewis the tenth, surnamed Hutin had two Wives, Marguerite, daughter of Robert Duke of Burgundy, by whom he had a daughter named Ioane, who was married after to Philip Count of Evreux, sonne to Lewis of France, brother to the late Philip the Faire, and by this meanes the Kingdome of Navarre entered into the families of the Counts of Evreux: and Clemence sister to Carlobert, King of Hungary, whom at his decease he left with Child of a sonne who was called Iohn: and although he dyed an infant, without having beene crowned, hee hath not beene heretofore ranked in the Catalogue of the Kings of France. Neverthelesse, seeing that he was truely legitimate, and sole heire to King Lewis Hutin, he deserved the title Royall, and to bee inserted to the number of Kings, seeing that dying hee was

with solemnity, and Regall pompe carryed to St. Denis; the Princes, his Vncles, and kinred being present at his Funeralls; where hee was proclaimed, although dead, King of France, and Navarre. In the meane time that Clemence was with Child, immediately upon the decease of Lewis Hutin, it was ordered by the Court of Parliament, that Mounsieur Philip of France, Count of Poitiers, should be Regent of the Kingdome untill the fruit of the Queene (if it were Male) should attaine to the maturity of eighteene yeares: and therefore hee he bore in his Armes the Title of Philip Sonne of the King of France, and Navarre, Regent of the Kingdomes of France, and Navarre. And so the Regency was given to the next Prince of Blood, so that hee were the nearest to succeed the Crowne. After the death of the said Iohn, who lived but eight daies, or at the most but 20 daies, (as some do write) there was some dispute amongst the Princes of the kingdome, some

maintaining the right to bee ill grounded upon Ioane, daughter to the late Lewis Hutin: and others resting upon the Iustice of the Salique Law, which yet was never violated in France, and ordayneth, that there being never an heire Male of a King, the next of Blood, of the Male side, shall come to the Crowne, and excludes the daughters and the descendents from them, although they be Males. But in the end the Parliament of the Paires and Counsell of France, adjudged that Philip the Tall, Vncle to the late Iohn, was the true and lawfull heire to the Crowne: which was the first debate and difference of the Salique Law.
               The King reigned but an yeare and an halfe, thereby to make good the position of Philosophy, Nullum violentum est aeternum; for his government was violent, and therefore could not long continue. Enguerand, accused by Charles Earle of Valois, and made odious to the people by his oppression of

them, whereof they are onely sensible, was made a Sacrifice and Hanged; but after his execution the Earle of Valois fell into a languishing Consumption, &amp; King Lewis Hutin dyed suddainly, so that the people began to imagine that Enguerands unjust death was thus revenged on these Princes; which change of their opinion, shewes that it was rightly spoken: what the people saies, a foole speakes: Therefore it is observeable, that good Subjects may be unjustly afflicted, that the people blinded by passion, and discerning not the truth, will undeservedly speake well and ill of the same Action, and the same man. And lastly, that great men, loving not to come to accompt, may abuse their authority.

                   Army every where compleate to Rheimes, where hee made himselfe to be annointed King by the Arch-bishop of that See on the Feast of the Epiphany, Anno Dom. 1317, and after returned to Paris: Whither hee summoned Robert Count of Artois, whom he forced to renounce the right which he pretended to that County, whereof hee had Vi &amp; Armis, by force and Armes taken possession, to the prejudice of Mahaut his Wives Mother. In the meane time Lewis, Count of Neuers, Sonne of Robert Count of Flanders, entertained the Flemings to his utmost endeavours in a revolt against the King; who, because hee came not to render homage for the Counties which hee held in France, was cited to answer for himselfe before the King: and fayling in his appearance, all his possessions were seized for the King. In the end the said Lewis, Count of Nevers, came and submitted himselfe to the King, and recovered his Countries. After, upon perswasion

of the Popes Legate, there was a peace concluded betweene the King and the Count of Flanders, the 15. of May, Anno Dom. 1320, insomuch that the said Count did homage for his Lands to the King of France, and accorded that Lewis, the sonne of Lewis of Nevers, should marry Madam Marguerite, the second Daughter of France, upon condition that he should succeede to the County of Flanders after his Grandfather and Father.
               About the same time the Marriage of Isabelle, the third Daughter to the King, with Guy the Dolphin of Vienna was treated, who not long after succeeded his Father John in Dauphine. The Eldest Daughter was before marryed to Odo Duke of Burgundy. After that the King quitted all the actions against his Subjects, which some of his Councell in abuse of his good nature had put upon and against them. And as he was deliberating to have but one sort of weights and measures, in one and the

same species, and also a certaine rate and value of monies, a malady intercepted his designes, by which hee ended his dayes the third of January, An. Dom. 1322.
               He was a Prince of a tractable disposition, and therefore easily corrupted; inclined more to ill than good. The chiefest thing worthy remembrance in his Reigne was, that his bad servants presuming on his gentle Nature, layd heavy taxations on the people, who thereupon maintained, and thus hee suffering his Authority to be abus'd by them, shew'd that although hee were great and tall of stature, yet hee had but little wit and understanding. A Benedicting Priest and Monke pretentending a voyage to the East, committed many outrages in the East, with a multitude of people by them assembled, and called themselves Shepheards, untill they were defeated in Languedoc.
               
               This Philip would have made one

weight and measure throughout his Realme, but it proved but an Eutopian conceite, not to be maintained by Authority or Reason. The Jewes which were formerly expelled and driven out of the Kingdome, were now againe admitted; but after they endeavoured to bring in an Artificiall Plague into the Kingdome, by using the helpe of Lepers, some were grievously punished, and the rest banished out of France. Lastly, this Kings five yeares Reigne was Rasa Tabula, a blanke Table, wherein Fame hath written no Royall action.

                     CHarles the 4, Count of Marche, brother to Philip the Tall, and to Lewis Hutin, came by the same Law to the Crowne, as his brother Philip had done, who left no issue Male to inherit. He was crowned the twelfth

of February, Anno Dom. 1322.. He was severe in Justice, giving every man his right; desirous that all should be guided and governed by the Lawes and Authority of Magistrates. Following that Norme, he caused Jordan of L'Isle, a great Lord to be attached, who upon accusations of infinite enormities was attainted and convicted: wherefore hee was hanged, although hee had marryed the Neece of Pope John 22, and (as others are of opinion) his Step-mother. About that time deceased Lewis Duke of Nevers, the eldest son of Robert Count of Flanders, who dyed immediately after. By which occasion Robert, the younger sonne of the said Robert Count of Flanders, entred into a difference with his Nephew Lewis, sonne of the Count of Nevers: Hereupon the cause was pleaded in the Court of Parliament, which proved of no validity to the good of the Nephew.
               Then began the Warres betweene the English and French, Anno Dom. 1324,

upon the occasion that the Lord of Montpesac would, to the Kings prejudice, fortifie a Castle in Gascogne, upon the borders of France. Whereupon the King sent Charles of Valois, his Unkle, who so happily acquitted himselfe of his charge, that hee recovered into the Kings powers all the Townes and strong holds in Burgundy, which are beyond the River Garonne, except Bourdeaux, Bayonne, and S. Senes. Afterwards having obtained a Truce of the English, he dyed in December, An. Dom. 1325, as also the King deceased at Bois de Vincennes, the first of March, leaving Madame Joane de Eureux his wife great with Child, who afterwards in the Moneth of April, 1328. was delivered of a Daughter called Blanche. Hee was the first King that ever permitted to the Pope the Decimations of the Churches of France.
               
               This King reigned sixe yeares, being wise, temperate, and just, three chiefe vertues in a Prince, but unhappy in his

progeny. Assoone as he was annointed, he held a great Sessions in Paris, to heare complaints, and caused many Gentlemen to be punished, in which number was one Jourdain of Lisle, a Gascon, who being Nephew to Pope John the 22, had beene pardoned for eighteene capitall crimes, and yet still grew more impious, former mercy making him presume more of pardon, untill at last he was taken, and brought to Paris, where King Charles caused him justly to be hang'd, as a memorable example, that Respect is an enemy to Justice, which must be executed without sparing the guilty. To conclude, this Prince was worthy of the French Monarchy, and deserved to be reckon'd amongst the chiefest men of State. And as the Kingdome was happy in having so worthy and sufficient a King, so his short Reigne deprived the Realme of that good which it should receive by his government. But the best and most perfect men, are in the blind world either

despised for excesse of good, or some tooke away by death, to envy greater happinesse, equall to their desert.

                  THis Philip Count of Valois, the Sonne of the late Count Charles, and Cousen german to the three

precedent Kings, succeeded to the Crowne by title of his favour, excluding Lewis of Evreux his Vncle (who at that time, as it is thought was already dead) and was confirmed by the States, notwithstanding that Edward King of England pretended the Crowne by his Mothers right, who was the onely daughter of Philip the Faire. He recovered a faire battaile against the Flemings, who had revolted against their Duke, and enforced the King of England to doe homage for the Dutchy of Guienne, and other lands which he held of the Crowne; who in revenge thereof entertained Robert of Artois, Count of Beaumont, who was banished out of France through a false accusation; by whose perswasion the King of England beeing allyed to all the Princes of the Empire, whereof hee had already obtained the Vicariate, beganne to warre against Philip in Nantonge, Anno Domini 1336. Afterwards he caused the Flemings to revolt against their Duke, by the means

of one James Artivel, an Artisan. The French that were in the Towne of L'Isle, and first discomfited the English and Flemings, but afterwards they were shamefully overthrowne at the Sluce Port, when they laboured to hinder the English from joyning with the Flemings. And after this victory he encamped before Tournay, where he continued during fifty dayes; during which time, the Mother of the Count of Hainault, wrought a Truce between the Kings of England and France, which continued not long, because the warres were renued shortly after betweene them, because the King of France caused Oliver de Clisson to bee executed for Treason: In which warre the French lost the memorable battaile of Crecy, neare Abeville, wherein the greatest part of the Nobility and flower of all France was slaine, and the Towne of Calais taken. After this, the King having marryed in a second wedlocke the Lady Blanche, daughter of the late Philip, King of

                  Navarre, and received the Danphinate of Humbert, together with the City and Countrey of Montpelier, for a purchase of the King of Maillorque, he retired to Nogent, there to conclude his daies the 23. or 28. of August 1350. leaving Iohn Duke of Normandy, and Philip Duke of Orleans.
               
               He was an ingenious wity Prince, as appeareth by his justification of the Salique Law, by these words of Scripture. Consider the Lillies of the field, how they doe grow, and doe neither labour nor spiune: intimating (whose Armes are Lillies or Flower de Lyces) should not fall to the Distaffe. Also he taxed the unfaithfulnesse of King Edward of England, in these two Verses by himselfe composed.
               
                  Anglicus Angelus est, cui nunquam credere fas est.
                  Dum tibi dicit Ave, tanquam ab hoste cave.

                  Beware of him as of a Foe, when he doth say God save thee.
               
               After his marriage with Blanch, daughter of Philip of Evreux, he lived not long after he had tyed this knot, this new wife being an unnecessary trouble in his old age; so that sickning at Nogent, advising his two sonnes to live in peace, and bee carefull of the Realme, which he resigned to the eldest, he concluded his reigne, and dyed. He was a King in whom vertues and vices were equally mingled; for he was valiant in danger, and couragious in affliction, just and loving to his subjects. But his rash valour, whereon hee presumed often, engaged him and his subjects in many miseries.

                  THis King comes here to be inserted amongst the Kings of France, being the first that left the Title Hereditary to the Kings of England, and first quartered the Armes of France with the English Armes, giving thereby occasion and provocation

of his succeeding Warres, he obtained a gentle victory at Sluce, upon Midsommer day in a sea fight: Afterward he challenged Philip of Valois, then King, to a single combate, by him not accepted, afterwards makes a Truce with France, their battailes being ready to joyne in Britagne in France, then he declares the Truce with France broken. He arrives afterward in France with bloody Colours, with his hopefull son the Prince of Wales, then about sixteen yeares old. Afterward he got the Lawrell wreath of Conquest in the battaile of Cressey; and his sonne was as victorious as his Father, both sharing equally in honour purchased by valour. But his sonne afterward, whose veines were full of his Fathers Spirit and fortitude, shewing that Nasci a Principibus est magnum, obtained another triumphant victory against the French at Poictiers, and by it confirmed his Fathers atchievements.
               Then againe Henry invaded France,
                  
besieges Paris, concludes a peace: King Iohn of France being taken prisoner, and afterward ransomed, hostages were also given, and so the Clouds of warre were a while drawne away: but suddainly againe France felt a new storme from England; for the Earle of Blois slaine in Battaile by the English, loseth the Dukedome of Britagne. Then againe King Edward sends Iohn Duke of Lancaster to invade Prance, and Sir Robert Knoles to the parts about Britagne: and thus, as he was famous for his many other Royall vertues expressed done at home, and in the circumference of his owne Dominions, so likewise he appeared in France like a flaming Comet, which boded the effusion of much French blood: But age &amp; sicknesse comming on hee was forc't to leave the world, as the same did him before his breath left him: but Nature could not hold out any longer, and he was forced to resigne his life into the hands of his Creator at Shene, (now

                  Richmond) the one and twentieth day of Iune, Anno Domini 1377. in the 64. yeare of his Age, having reigned fifty yeares, foure moneths, and odde dayes; in which time France felt the desolation which warre had made, he carrying away the never dying Fame of a valiant Conquerour, he lyeth buried at Westminster, for as much of him as was Mortall; but Multum sui vitabit Libitinam, his sonle and Fame are immortall in Heaven and on earth, and was especially famous for Conquering France, and writing himselfe, Roy de Angle terre &amp; France, King of England and France.

                     JOHN the first, or second of that Name, succeeded to the Crown, and was consecrated at Rheims the 26. of Septem. An Dom. 1350. In the beginning of his reigne hee caused the Lord Ralph of Nesle, Cōstable of France, to be beheaded for Treason, and in his

place hee jnstituted Charles of Spaine, Count of Angolesme. The Truce being broken betweene him and England, he betooke him to S. John d' Angely, and in his returne he instituted the Order of the Starre in the Noble and Royall House or S. Owen. Afterwards Charles King of Navarre, caused the Constable to be massacred upon a jealousie which hee had conceived against him, on the sixt of Ianuary, 1353, and the Lord Iames de Bourbon was substituted in his place. In the meane time the King of Navarre, whom the King of Prance had pardoned, instead of acknowledging his fault, complotted against the State of the said King, which being discovered, he entred into an Amity with the King of England. By meanes whereof King Iohn having surprised him, sent him prisoner to Paris. Hereupon Philip of Navarre, his brother, in an indignation caused the English to come into Normandy, against whom the King intending an opposition, was enforced

to turne it upon the Prince of Wales in Poicton, where having lost the field through his temerity, hee was taken Prisoner. In the meane time the Parisians at the perswasion of Stephen Martel, mutinyed against the Dauphin, who tooke upon him the Regency of the Realme, and appeased the tumult, having first restored the places of Normandy to the King of Navarre, who had escaped out of prison.
               Afterwards upon a treaty made at Bretigny the eight of May, 1360, a peace was concluded with the English, and ratified at Calais the 24. of October. In the meane time Philip, Duke of Burgundy, deceased at Roucere neere Dijon without issue, by reason whereof Iohn the King declared himselfe to be his Heire. After that he making a preparation for a beyond-sea voyage, first came to London, intending to make a strong peace with England, and dyed there the eighth or ninth of April, 1364, leaving Charles the Dauphin, Lewis
                  
Duke of Aniou, John Duke of Berry, and Philip Hardy Duke of Burgundy.
               
               This King shewed magnanimity in his most adverse fortune; for Apparet virtus arguitur

               which was verified in this King John, who sitting in the English Campe at a Supper, prepared for him by the Prince of Wales, who had taken him prisoner in the Battell of Poitiers, said, I purposed to have bestowed a Supper on you this night, but the fortune of the War hath made me your Guest. The Englishmen for a summe of money having got by composition the Castle and Towne of Gwines, King Iohn complaining to the King of England, that the Truce was broken, contrary to their compact and agreement, King Edward answered, That Trafficke or Merchandise, the surrender of the Castle being by money procured, did not breake the former Truce.
               
                  This King, when King Edward required homage for the Realme of France, as held of England, answered, that hee could not justly alienate a right inalienable, received from his Ancestors, and therefore he resolved to leave it entire to his children, for affliction might engage his person, but not the Crowne of France, while hee was King, who would sacrifice his life for the preservation of France. Hee dyed in England Anno 1364, being a good Prince, but infortunate; wise in ordinary matters, but not in great affaires; just, but too confident in trusting others; temperate in his private life, but violent in the publicke government. For great vertues meeting with Wisdome, doe on the Theater of this life give unto Kings a Crowne of applause and commendation.

                  AFter the decease of Iohn the first, this Charles 5. surnamed the Wise, was crowned the 19. of March, Anno Dom. 1364. At the comming to the Crowne, hee gained against those of Navarre a very memorable victory under the Conduct of the

Lord Bertrand du Guesclin, in favour whereof he gave him the Dukedome of Longueville. From thence the said Guesclin went to aide Charles of Blois, against whom Iohn of Monfort relying upon the English, had begun warres for the Dutchy of Bretagne, where he was taken fighting valiantly before the Castle of Aulroy, against Iohn Lord Chandos, High Marshall of England: but a peace being made betweene the Duke of Monfort and the Countesse of Blois, the King likewise made a peace with those of Navarre, and after sent Guesclin to ayde Peter King of Arragon, against Peter King of Castile in favour of Henry, Sancho and Telco his naturall brothers; and also in revenge of the death of his Wife Blanche, the daughter of the Duke of Bourbon, whom hee had caused to be slaine. Peter of Castile being deposed of his kingdome, and Henry substituted, hee retired to the Prince of Wales, who restored him to his former estate.
               
                  After returning into Guienne, he imposed upon his Subjects unaccustomed taxations and imposts, which caused the Lords of Armaignac and of Albert to appeale to the King of France, as to their Soveraigne Lord, which was a cause that moved Charles to give an eare to Henry, who offered to hold his kingdome of Castile from him, so that hee would ayde him in the re-conquest thereof. Whereupon the King sent him Guesclin, who gained fixe battells against his Enemy, and in the fixt Peter of Castile was taken by the Lord de Villaines, a French Knight, of whom Henry ransomed him, and put him to death, enjoying by that meanes the kingdome of Castile.
               
               In the meane time, because the King embraced the appeale of the Lords of Gascogne, the Prince of Wales denounced warre against him, which the King managed so well by the assistance of his brothers, that repairing the losses of his Father and Grandfather received by

the English, hee reconquered Guienne, Poictou, and Bretagne, and deceased in September, Anno Dom. 1380, leaving Charles and Lewis under the tuition of their Unkles.
               This King had many vertues, shining in all estates, both in happinesse and adversity, and when the Realme was in the heate of troubles, he saved it from ruine, so that his fame was spred abroad, leaving an honourable remembrance to his posterity. Hee favoured Learning and the learned, preferring the Schoolemaster Nicholas Oresme: He caused the Bible to be translated, imitating therein St. Lewis, and tooke great delight to read the Scripture and Philosophy, and he made Aristotles Ethicks and Politicks, and many places of Tully to be translated into French; and his favour shewed to learned men, cherished their fancies, and made them seeke unto the forsaken Muses for witty inventions. Hee would heare Suits in open Court, and redresse the wrongs

of the oppressed, and tooke pleasure to advance his houshold servants, and gave them meanes for bringing up their sons, and marrying their daughters: And as he was a favourer of Learning, so Bartholl, Baldus, Petrarch, Bociac, Plorindes, Bonaventure, and John Wickliffe of Oxford in England lived in his Reigne. But Vertues are not hereditary, for Charles sonne to this King, degenerated from his Father, and the Kingdome of France was afterward punished in the weaknesse of the succeeding Kings, so that the confused government brought forth sad effects, such as are to bee expected where the rabble multitude have a power unrestrained by Authority, and doe swarme and rove about like unruly Bees.

                  THis Charles 6. about the age of 14. yeares, was crowned the first of November, Anno. Dom. 1380. In the beginning of his Reigne hee received homage for the Dutchy of Bretagne, and enforced the Gaulois to their obedience to their Duke; as also

he chastised the Parisians, who had mutinyed about imposts, having Mallets as a token of their faction, whereupon they were called Maillotins. In the meane time Peter de Craon wounded Clifson Constable of France, whereof the King intending a revenge, fell into a frensie, by reason whereof the kingdome was put into the hands of the Dukes of Berry and Burgundy, who laying hands upon Clisson, by an Act of Parlement, caused him to be deprived of his estate, and banished the kingdome.
               The King of England marryed the Lady Isabell, the eldest Daughter to Charles. whereupon a Truce was concluded betweene the English and French for Thirty yeares. But King Richard being afterward slaine, shee was sent backe into France without a Dowry; by reason whereof the Duke of Orleans presented a combate of seven French against seven English within the lists, which combate the French gained. Then

also upon some rancors and dissentions betweene the houses of Burgundy and Orleans for the government of the Kingdome, John the eldest sonne of the late Count of Burgundy, caused the Duke of Orleans, brother to the King, to be slaine the 22. of November, 1407, whereupon ensued all the subsequent disorders in France, by meanes whereof the King of England gained the famous and memorable battaile of Agincourt, and continued his warres for the space of 29. or 30. yeares, during which he tooke Rouen, and in a manner all Normandy. In those times also the Duke of Burgundy was slaine at a Parlement upon the Bridge of Montereau Faux-yonne, by those that accompanied the Dauphine, who for that fact was by his Father Charles, not yet in sense, dis-inherited, and in his place he instituted Henry King of England, to whom upon a peace hee had given in marriage Katherine of France, together with the government of France and

                  Paris, making warres against the Dauphin untill death, which was followed with that of the King, who had before given consent to the Duke of Bedford, to be Regent in France for young King Henry, who was yet in his Cradle.
               This Charles the 6. was of a magnanimous and Heroick soule, full of the fire of true valour, which upon any brave occasion broke forth in glorious actions: which vertue was declared in his younger yeares by this answer to his Father Charles the fifth, by whom a Crowne of Gold enchased with precious Stones, and a Helmet of Steele fairely guilt, being propounded to his choise, hee answered hee would rather chuse the Helmet than the Crowne. Afterward being crowned King of France, this Sonne of valour rising in the spheare of Majesty, shined forth with early beames of valour; for being shewed by his Officers, his deceased Fathers rich Treasury and precious moveables, and also his Armory full of warlicke Furniture,

and all sorts of Armes, hee said, He had rather have those Armes, than his Fathers Riches. As this King and his Noblemen marched against the Duke of Britaine, being entred the Forrest of Mans, a man bare-headed and bare-legged, attired in a Coate of white Rugge, steps suddainly forth betwixt two Trees, taking hold of the Raines of the Kings Horse, and staying him, said unto him: King ride no farther, but returne backe, for thou art betrayed: The King was amazed at this voice and the man being forced with blowes to leave the Raines of his Horse, vanished. Afterward it chanced that his Page being very sleepy, let fall his Lance upon him which carryed the Helmet, making a great noise like the rustling of Armes, the King starts with amazement at this noise, and seeing the Crimson Bandroll of the Lance, having his spirits weakened with the former distemperatures, transported with the imagination of this sound, sleepy with labour

and heate, he imagins himselfe to be compassed in with many armed men which pursu'd him to the death. Charles thus transported with this phrenzy, layes hold on his Sword, drawes it, runnes violently after his Pages, and calls them Traytors. The Pages conceiving at first that hee had beene displeased for the disorder of the Lance, flye from him: The King follows after: The Duke of Orleance runnes towards him to let him know the cause of his anger. The King very violently layes at him, not knowing him; the Duke flyes, and the King follows. Thereupon all drawing neare unto him, they take his Sword from him, and his thick Velvet Jerkin, and scarlet Cap, and lay him on the ground.
               Pope Urban his Enemy, triumphing and rejoycing at his misery, said it was a just judgment of God for supporting and assisting his Competitor: But the holy Scripture sayes, O how
                  
                  happy is he that judgeth wisely of the afflicted, representing an admirable example in Job, who was accused by his friends that hee was an hypocrite, good in shew, but not in integrity of life. Such is the judgment of the World, accounting adversity a vice, and prosperity a vertue, measuring matters according to their passions, and not with reason; for GODS Judgments are just and righteous, but the causes thereof are unknowne, though GOD doth all well whatsoever he doth.

                  THough it be more easie to succeed in victoryes, than atchieve them, yet this Henry maintained by the sword that Title of King of France, which his Predecessor, Edward the third had gained; and as King Edward cut down the Flower of France
                  
in the Battaile of Cressey, so Henry the fift, exasperated by the Dolpins of France, sending him a Tunne of Tennis Balls, sent him backe such Iron Balls, or Bullets, that the French were neare brought to a great hazzard in this Tennis Court, or field of Mars. For hereby Henry wonne France, teaching Princes, that contempt addes a double courage, when right is by contumelies sought with greater violence.
               Afterward King Henry tooke Harflew, and fought the memorable battaile of Agincourt, wherein hee got a wonderfull and unexpected victory, by a stratagem of erecting sharpe Stakes before the foote troopes, whereupon the Horse issuing violently, they were disranked and routed, so that the earth blush't with blood to see the French so overtaken, and also the Archers upon the nicke of this opportunity sent many showres of Arrowes, whereby the whole Army on the French side was discomfited; and the English Archers

giving backe, the French Horsemen ran themselves upon the sharpe poynted stakes. At last the French maine Battaile was put to flight, and then King Henry gave thankes unto God, the giver of all victoryes.
               This Battaile was famous, triumphant, and fortunate; the successe whereof was celebrated with great joy at the Kings returne into England; Princes being then most amiable (as well as private men) in the sight of their subjects, when Fortune smiles on their attempts: and Victories, such as this was at Poictiers, makes their vertues more apparant.
               Afterward, Truce being made with the French, and by them broken, hee invades France againe, and takes the Towne of Harflew in Normandy, and Cane. Then proceeding in his Conquest of Normandy, takes Fallais, after a long siege, and Articles of agreement confirmed by the King, he besieges also Roane, and the Lady Katharines Picture

was sent to King Henry, to move him to pitty Roane: Hee grants them peace, and receives of the Burgesses of Roane 356000. Crownes of gold, upon the sixteenth of June, Anno Domini 1418.
               Afterward many Townes were surrendered to Henry: At last a peace was concluded betweene King Henry, and King Charles, and the Duke of Burgogne. Afterward Henry goes in person to Trois. where he was met by Iohn King of France, the Queene, and the Lady Katharine, to whom hee was contracted, and by their marriage peace was established in France, and the Crowne of France was entailed to England; and the Subjects of France were sworne to duty of allegeance unto King Henry; as also the two Crownes of England and France were united and confirmed to King Henry, by his marrying the Lady Katherine; for marryages have alwayes beene the happy conclusions of Tragicall

Warres, as may appeare by happy marriage.
               Afterward the French growing rebellious, King Henry besieges Paris, and takes it. Bicardy afterward sweares fealty and obedience to King Hen. Matters being setled, all the Warres was concluded with joyfull Solemnities at the marriage of King Henry and the Lady Katharine, with whom he returned afterward into England, where every Subject exprest his love and loyalty to him, each one contending, who should be the forwardest for the entertaining of so Noble and victorious a Prince, and his most Royall Consort.
               Afterward King Henry being at the siege of Meaux, his wife was delivered of Henry of Munmouth, his last joy on earth; for not long after sickning at at Melum, and his malady encreasing at Bois De vincennois, hee cheerefully rendred his Soule to GOD, who received him to immortall joy, where

he remaines Crowned with Caelestiall glory, while his body being conveyed into England, was with all pompous Celebrity interred in the Church at Westminster, where on his Tombe are ingraven these Verses.

                  AFter the decease of Charles the 6, Charles 7. his sonne, began to style himselfe King of France, notwithstanding that his Father had dis-inherited him, and given it to Henry King of England. In the beginning of his Reigne having made Count

                  Arthur, brother to the Duke of Bretagne, High Constable of France, sent him against the English, who in a manner were Masters of all France, and had now beleaguered Orleans contrary to their promise made to their Duke, who at that time was prisoner in England: whereupon the King sent the Count of Dunois, the Bastard of Orleans, Pothon, Hire, all valiant Commanders to relieve it. At that time the French lost the Battaile of Harens: whereupon the King being enraged, and not knowing which way best to betake himselfe, was encouraged by Joane the Maid, who miraculously drove the English from before Orleance: and having recovered many lost Townes, and gained the battaile neare Patay, and conveyed the King to be crowned at Rheims, but upon a Sally which she made out of Champagne upon the English, she was taken, and put to death at Rouen.
               
               In the end a peace being made betweene the Duke of Burgundy and the

King of France, they first drove the English out of Paris, nineteene yeares after their enjoying it, into which the King made his entry the twelfth of November, Anno Domini 1437, to equall which there presently ensued the Praguery Faction. The quarrells also of the Houses of Orleance and Burgundy were extinguished by the Marriage of Charles Duke of Orleance, with Mary of Cleue, neare to the Duke of Burgundy: The English also lived promiscuously with the French, but the Truce being broken by an English Captaine, who took in the Castle of Fougeres, the King imployed his uttermost to quit France of all the English: and thereupon hee to this designe appointed his Francarchers or Boemen, and began with Normandy, which he reduced wholly to his obedience: after that Guienne and the Citty of Bourdeaux, insomuch that the English could retaine nothing on that side the Seas, but Cales and the County of Guiennes. The King enjoying

this repose of peace, was much troubled with the absence of the Dauphin, who for sixe yeares had betaken himselfe to the Duke of Burgundy, and thence into Brabant, where hee remained till his Fathers decease, which was the 22. of July, Anno Dom. 1461.
               This King being unfortunate in his Warres, grew so behind hand both in fame and estate, that amongst other afflictions, hee was burthened with reproach and poverty, so that he dined in his Chamber, attended on by his houshold servants, where Pothon and la Hire comming to Chusteandun to require succours, found him at Table with a Rumpe of Mutton and two Chickens. He was reproached for the love of faire Agnes, but the History of St. Dennis reports, that hee loved her onely for her pleasing behaviour, eloquent speech, and beauty, and that he never used any lascivious action unto her, nor never touched her beneath the chinne. Joane a Virgin, or rather

Witch, professing that she had a Revelation how to succour the King, and chase the English from Orleance, was brought by the Lord of Baudie Court, Provost of Vancoleurs to Chinon, attired like a man. The King takes upon him the habite of a Countryman, yet shee goes directly to the King, although they told her shee was mistaken. Shee had Armes and Horse given her, with a Troope to enter the City, accompanied by the Admirall and Martiall of France: Shee comes to Orleance, they rejoyce to behold the Maiden Warriour, whereupon Joane sends threats to the English by Letter, subscribed, Vnderstand these Newes from God and from the Virgin. Orleance was assaulted by her counsell: The Virgin entred the Fort first, crying, Montjoy St. Dennis, the Fort is wonne. The English grew amazed at the Virgins exploits: In memory whereof a Monument was erected; King Charles the seventh armed, and Joane the Virgin

armed, kneeling on their knees before a Crucifixe of Brasse, which is still to bee seene upon the Bridge at Orleance.

                     LEwis the 11. departing out of Brabant, being accompanyed with the Duke, Philip of Burgundy, and the Count of Charolois his

sonne, caused himselfe to be crowned King of France▪
                   the fifteenth of August 1461. The Princes seeing themselves in contempt, especially Mounsier Charles his brother, who rose up in Armes against him, under a pretensive colour for the common good, giving him the famous battaile of Montlehery, the fifteenth of Iuly, Anno Domini 1463. The King for the dissipating of their forces, following the advise of the Duke of Milan, gave Normandy to his brother, which afterwards by subtilties he withdrew from him againe. But in the end hee was enforced by the Duke of Burgundy to give unto his brother Mounsier Charles the Counties of Champagne and Brie, which hee afterward exchanged for the Dutchy of Guienne, by this meanes to weane him from the Duke of Burgundy, recalling all the Townes upon this side the River Somme; and afterwards against his brother Charles, for the withdrawing of the Dutchy of Guienne, who immediately

dyed, not without suspition of poyson. Afterwards he made a treaty of peace at Bouvines, with the Dukes of Bretagne and Burgundy for the ensnaring of the High Constable S. Paul, who had beene the prime sparke of all the dissentions after the battaile of Montlehery. In the meane time the King works the Duke of Burgundy quite out with the Emperour Fredericke, and with the Duke of Loraine, working his ruine at the siege of Mus. Then he takes in many Townes of the Burgundion, who had appealed to the English for aide, with whom the King had already made a treaty of Piquigny, by which Charles the Kings sonne was to marry with the daughter of England, when they came to be of age; which constrained the Burgundion to make his peace with the King, and to deliver the High Constable into his power. The Duke of Burgundy was slaine before Nancy, leaving one sole Daughter Mary, who was marryed to Maximilian, the onely son

of the Emperour Fredericke; by reason whereof the King recovered all the Countrey upon the Somme, together with the Dutchy and County of Burgundy. But afterwards the Prince of Orange caused the Franch-Conite to revolt. After this the King allyed himselfe to the Swisses, and recovered the County of Provence, from Renatus Duke of Aniou, by way of Donation. The K. afterwards having marryed his son Charles to the Lady Marguerite of Flanders, hee surrendered his life the 30 of Aug. 1483.
               Hee said that Charles the sage might be a wise man in his Tiring-Chamber, or Closet, but in giving his youngest brother the Dutchy of Burgundy, hee played the fooles part. Being told after a battaile, that his enemy Count Charolois did lodge in the field: He replyed, That he having neither Towne nor Castle must needes lodge in a fieldbed. It was his usuall saying: That when pride walketh, or rideth afore, shame and dishonour, like servingmen,

attend behind. Being told that one of the Canons of the Church where hee had heard Masse was dead, he gave the Prebendship to a Priest which lay sleeping in an adjoyning Chappell, that hee should say afterward, that his good fortune came unto him sleeping. To a Gentleman that was ready to handle a rich Chaine of gold, which a Captaine wore about his neck, and was suspected to be made of the reliques of a Church, he said: Take heede how you touch that Chaine, for it is a holy thing.
               He said also, that, in regard of his troubles at the beginning of his reigne, if by the expression of courage and experience he had not procured feare and reverence, he might have beene ranked amongst the unfortunate Princes in the last Chapter of Boccace. A rich Nobleman having builded a faire Hospitall, he said, That having made many poore for the Hospitall, hee might justly make an Hospitall for the poore, and so convert his sinnes into Almes-houses. Hee

would often say to his Noblemen, that his sonne should learne no more Latine, than Qui nescit dissimulare, nescit regnare; and that the government of the Kingdome and Common-wealth was his best study, for other studies would too much soften his minde, and Historicall examples, unfortunate in their event, and successe, would discourage him from attempting brave Actions. He said also that the Genowayes should not long remaine under his protection, for he would bequeath them to the Divell. Being advised to send an Embassadour, that had many Dignities and Titles: he said he is like a peece of Brachigraphy, that hath many a Title but Learning very little. Being told that the Gout haunted rich men that fared deliciously, and wore fine cloathing; he said, hee would alwaies afterward weare cloathcloathes, because the Gout should not take him for a rich man. He could finde all things he said in his Kingdome, and his Court, except truth, which was sicke

in his fathers time, and was now starke dead, having before her death made no Confession to a Priest. The Realme of France he said was a meddow which he did cut every yeere, and as often as he listed. He asking a meane fellow, which knew not the King when he saw him, what he gained by following the Court? The fellow answered, I get as much as the King, that is, maintenance while I live, and a sheete when I dye.
               He said that a curious ignorant man, having a Library of faire Bookes, was like a crooke-backt man having a Bunch on his backe, whereby the deformity of the one, &amp; the ignorance of the other was more discerned. He made gold the engine of his actions, saying, that an Army of silver Launces doth usually winne the victory. Great services (he said) through the arrogancy of the parties performing them, or the neglect of Princes regarding them, were often recompenced with hatred or ingratitude▪ and therefore the bounty of Princes exceeding

desert was more fortunate and happy than desert exceeding the bounty of Princes, not enduring to be indebted or obliged. Having felt the smart of the English warres, he said the King of England was his Brother in his owne Countrey, but hee did not like his company in France.
               
               Having caused a faire goodly Tombe to bee made for the faire Lady Agnes, the love of his late Father, the Cannons of the Church desiring that the Monument might bee removed out of the heart of the Church into a side Ile, or Chappell, he answered, that their request was neither just nor reasonable, neither would he suffer her Tombe (whom his father loved) to be violated.
               After Monsieur Bussi was beheaded and buryed, he caused the head to be digged up againe, and placed on a wooden pole in the Market place, and so being covered with a scarlet Cappe, furred with Minivere, in regard he had

beene a Counsellour of the Parliament. A suiter to the King for an Office, bein denyed, humbly thanked his Majestie, who wondring at his moderate, yet man-like spirit, asked if he conceived a right of his answer? yes, said the Suiter, and I thanke your Majesty for giving me a dispatching denyall, rather than feeding delayes: with which Answer the King was so contented, that he had his Office immediatly granted.
               A Noble-man seeing this King ride a Hunting on a very little Horse, said he had gotten a goodly stout Horse; for though he seemed but weake and little, yet he must needes be very strong, because he carryed him with all his Counsell: Thereby taxing the King, preferring the wisedome of his owne conceite before all other Counsell.
               Hee demanding what present he might bestow on the English Embassadors that might not cost him much, was answered; That he might present

them with his Musitians, that so they might not cost him much, as formerly they had done.
               Before the joyning of a Battaile, this King said hastily unto a Noble-man, that he had no affiance in his service: who for proofe thereof, having desired to exchange Armes and Ensignes with the King, charged bravely on the enemy, and being supposed to be the King, was slaine: wherein the King with weeping teares sayd, he had lost his life to expresse his love and loyalty. Being informed that the Saracens were misreckned 10000 Francks, in the payment of 200000 thousand pounds for a ransome, he would not embarke or set saile untill the aforesaid Francks were paid: such was his fidelity to those Infidells. This King having appoynted a Bishop to goe take a Muster of the Souldiers in Paris, a great Noble-man desired a Commission to reforme the Bishops Church, saying that employment was as fit for him, as the other was for the

Bishop. When this King was Daulphin of France, he taking great pleasure in hunting, often resorted to a poore Forresters Cottage, where he did use to eate Radishes, he comming to be King, the Forrester perswaded by his Wife, &amp; in hope of reward, presented to the King a faire Radish, which his Majesty accepted, and rewarded the Forrester with a thousand Crownes. Afterward a Courtier presented the King with a faire goodly Horse, expecting a greater reward, because he had beene so bountifull to the Forrester. But the King contrary to his expectation, gave the Courtier his Radish, wrapped up in white paper; the Courtier returning to his lodging, opening the packet, found nothing but a Radish, whereupon he informed the King of the mistake, as he supposed: The King said, I have paide thee well for thy horse: for the present which I gave thee cost mee a thousand Crownes; thus the poore mans good affection was wel rewarded,

and the Courtiers audaciousnesse slightly regarded.
               This Lewis sends an Embassadour to the Emperour, to excuse him for not sending an army, promised by treaty, entreating him not to make a greement with the Duke of Burgogne; but that he should confiscate all the Dukes Signonories that held of the Emperour, as hee would doe those that held of the Crowne of France: The Emperour answered, that they must not divide the Beares skinne before the Beast be dead. This King commming to an interview of the King of Castile, unto whom hee was formerly strickly allyed, conceived a contempt and disdaine each of other: The French of the Castilians sumptuousnesse and pride, in their words, countenance and apparrell: The Castilians of the plainnesse of the French attire: So as from that day these Kings did never love, and the French did ever since hate the Spaniard.

                     CHARLES the 8. at the age of 13. yeares came to the Crowne, under the Regency of Madam de Beavieu his owne Sister, and of the Duke of Bourbon her Husband: whereupon the Duke of Orleance, the nearest to the Crowne, and had married his

other Sister, as in an indignity conceived, convocated and summoned all the Statesmen to Tours. In the meane time the Duke of Orleance seeing that Madam of Beavieu managed all the affaires of the kingdome, retired himselfe into Bretagne; whereupon the King made Warre against him, and recovered a Battaile against him at St. Albins, the Duke of Orleance, and the Prince of Orange being taken Prisoners. After this the Duke of Bretagne deceased, leaving his sole Daughter Anne. Inheretrix: who notwithstanding that she had made a promise to Maximilian, King of the Romans, was after marryed to the King, for which cause the King of England made a preparation for Warre against him in the behalfe of Maximilian, but it was concluded that the King should send backe the Princesse Marguerite with her Dowry of the Countries of Artois and Burgundy. After, having surrendred the County of Roussillon to the Spaniard by the perswasion of his

Confessour, he went upon the recovery of the succession which Renatus, the late King of Sicily, and Charles the Count of Maine his brother, had left unto him by Will, for the rights which they pretended to the kingdome of Naples.
               
               In his journey hee was Regally entertained by Ludovicus Ssorza, surnamed the Moore, in the Towne of Ast: and after having proceeded into Tuscany, by Peter de Medicis, who delivered into his command the Fortresses of Florence and the City of Pisa: From thence hee went to Rome, where nolens volens, he entered, Alexander 6. being then Pope, who working his peace with him, gave him the Title of Emperour of Constantinople, and invested him to the kingdome of Naples: whither the King having made his entrance the 12. of May, Anno Dom. 1495, hee was crowned King of Sicily. Whereupon the Monarchs and Potentates of Italy being amazed, intended him an Ambuscade

in his returne at Fournoue; but the King passing another way, escaped the plot, and came safe into France: where having intelligence of the losse of Naples, and intending a second voyage thither for the recovery of his losses, dyed of an Apoplexy, as hee was seeing a Game at Tennis in the Castle of Amboise, the seventh of April, Anno Domini 1498.
               This King among other facetious sayings, gave the Florentine Embassadours this merry Answer, denoting their unfaithfulnesse, in these two Italian Verses:
               
                  Concortesia e fede poca
                  Va a Florence vender loca.
               
               
                  To Florence he went of his Goose to make sale,
                  Without any faith or courtesie at all.
               
               which Verses were formerly made on this occasion: A Countrey Pesant sold a fat Goose to a faire Dame of Florence, for the fond satisfaction of Venery, but

afterward on colder thoughts growing wiser, this piece of leatherne ignorance, contrary to his former agreement, without either fidelity or courtesie, demanded the price of his Goose in the presence of her Husband, and made her, for the former sawce of the Goose, pay him againe. And with this Italian Proverb, which had this wanton Originall, the King answered the unfaithfull Embassadours of Florence. His Queene Anne having received tidings of his Death, said; Gods will be done, I doubt not but I shall be as great as I was before, intimating thereby her hopes to be Queene of France; afterwards verified by her Marriage with King Lewis the twelfth. Friar Jerosine Savonarola living at Florence, foretold in his Sermons that this King should come into Italy, and obtaine great victories, which fell out accordingly; and in those Warres nothing was gained but a stinking contagious disease, afterwards spred over all France, and

since then called the French Poxe. After this King had ended his warres, he builded a Castle at Ambois, not knowing that instead of a stately Palace, hee should end his life in a base and filthy Gallery. He intending to reforme his life, it chanced the seventh of April, going after with the Queene into the Castle-ditches, hee strooke his forehead against the doore of a Gallery, whereas he meant to see a set at Tennis. This blow driving him to the premeditation of his approaching end, hee said to his Confessour, that hee would never commit any mortall or veniall sin, if he could avoide it, which was a good reservation: upon this protestation hee fell back ward into an Apoplexy, wherewith he had beene troubled, and dyed about 11. a clocke at night, in a Chamber neare to a Gallery, stinking with the urine which every one made as he passed through it, being laid on a Matresse, such as they could finde by chance. In him the direct Line failed, and the Crowne

came to the Collaterall Line, the nearest whereof was Lewis Duke of Orleance, and Valois his Successor.

                  THis Lewis the 12. succeeded according to the Custome of France, to Charles the 8, who dyed without issue, and was crowned

the 27. of May. Hee repudiated the Lady Joane of France for her indisposition of conception, and marryed the Lady Anne of Bretagne, Widow to the late King. Afterwards having made sure of Milan, Genes, and Lombardy, by the taking of Ludovicus Sforza, hee made an accord with the King of Spaine, with whom hee conquered the Kingdome of Naples, which was after lost by the French through the infidelity and perfidious treachery of the Spaniard. Whereupon the King having yeelded his claime and part that he pretended to it, unto Ferdinand King of Aragon, in favour of the Marriage of Madame Germaine de Foix, his owne Sisters Daughter, and makes an agreement with the Pope against the Venetians, against whom hee gained a battaile the 15. of May, Anno Dom. 1509, without any assistance of the Truce. Hee withstood the Pope, who declared himselfe an Enemy to the French, and he tooke many places in the Dutchy of Ferrara,
                  
which gave an occasion to the Duke to recover what he had lost: as also Gaston de Foix raised the Popes Army from before Bologna, and relieved the City of Brescia, which the Venetians had now beleaguered; and having defeated their Army, from thence he went to hazard his life before Ravenna, having first wonne the field. The Lord of Palisse was substituted in his place as Commanmander, who sacked it. Whereupon the Emperour and the Pope joyning with the English, recovered many Townes upon the French, and the Spaniard re-entered into the kingdome of Naples. VVhereupon King Lewis being moved, sent the Duke of Longueville with an Army to re-estate the King of Navarre into his Kingdome: but hee was constrained to returne without any effect, which was a cause that the King being desirous to re-enter his Dutchy of Milan, accorded with the Spaniard and the Venetian, and after sent the Lord of Tremoville with his Army into

                  Italy, whence he was beaten out by the Swisses. In the meane time the King of England besieged Therouenne, where was fought the battaile of Esperons, after which King Lewis being a widower, married with the Daughter of the King of England, with whom hee having peace, as he was in a preparation for an Army into Italy, hee was prevented by death, the first day of the yeare 1515. Hee was surnamed The Father of the people.
               
               This King being instigated and perswaded by some of his familiars to take revenge on the Citizens of Orleance, because when hee was Duke of Orleance, and when Charles the 8. maintaining warres against him, had compelled him to flye into Brittaine, they had shut the gates of their City against him: But he forgetting their former injury, answered; That being now King of France, hee would not revenge injuries done to the Duke of Orleance. Hee being told, making warre then in Italy for

the recovery of the Dutchy of Millaine, that Agnadell was taken by his Enemies, who had there taken up their lodging, answered: Then will I lodge upon their bellies, or else they shall lodge upon mine. Being advised to preserve his person from the shot of the great Ordnance, he answered, A rightfull King of France was never slaine with the shot of a Cannon: Therefore let him that is affraid, come behinde me. Hee lying in Campe, and a Souldier standing neare him, being slaine with a Cannon shot, and shewed unto the King, hee smild and said, He is but a little cold in his hands.
               This King having commanded that a company of Foot-men should be levied of strong active men, and at the day appointed a company of old Souldiers, as appeared by scarres, being presented unto him, said; These men, as it seemes by their wounds, were more willing to take than to give blowes. Whereupon the Souldier replyed, They were not

valianter than we, for they wounded us, but we slew them. To a Gentleman that boasted of his scarres and wounds in his face, and desired the King to reward his service, hee said, Take heed hereafter of turning backe thy face when thou art flying from thy Enemy. He being disswaded from making Warres on the Venetians, being a wise and prudent people, said, Wee will set so many fooles upon them that shall beard them to the teeth, that they shall not know which way to turne. To certaine Embassadours of Greece that demanded succours against the Turke, he objected this old Verse Barbara Graeca genus retinent quod habere solebant. The Lords of the Parliament refusing to admit a Councellour for his ignorance and insufficiency, though preferred by the King; he asked them how many Councellours there were? They replyed, an Hundred: Then said the King, cannot you many wise men make one become wife? A Courtier being wonder'd at

for his great stature, and accounted a Gyant, the King said, it is no wonder, for his Mother tooke paines to make him, and perhaps hee had many Fathers. He told the Ladies of the Court, that Hinds had at first Hornes as well as Harts, but for their pride and rebellion against the Harts, Nature offended therewith, deprived them of their Hornes, to shew that Wives should be obedient to their Husbands. Hee told the Duke of Angolesme his sonne in law, that a certaine Father and his son travelling towards a Towne, the sonne said, that now they were almost at the Towne; but yet they afterward travelled untill it was night before they could get to the Towne: whither being come, the Father said to the Sonne, Henceforth Sonne, never say I am at the Towne, till thou art past the Gates. He said also that Asses were happier than Horses, for Horses runne post to Rome to get those Benefices whereof Asses are

possessed. Being asked to marry his Daughter the Lady Claudia to a strange Prince, he said, I will make no alliance but with the Kats and Mice of my owne Kingdome.

the 12, who dyed without heires Males. He was consecrated at Rheims the 25. of January, 1515, at which time Charles of Bourbon was made Constable of France. The King having taken Prosper Collonne, and obtained two battailes against the Swisses, tooke Milan. After by the perswasion of Pope Leo the tenth, the Milaners revolted, and immediately after, Charles of Bourbon tooke part with Charles the fifth, Emperour. The King accompanied with the Marshall of Chabanes, having recovered the Dutchy of Milan into his power, he went to besiege Pavia, where he was taken, and by the industrious treaty of Madric, Anno Dom. 1525, hee was sent backe into France. Afterwards Charles of Bourbou was slaine, skaling the Walls of Rome, which was taken by the Spaniards with the Pope. Anno Dom. 1529. a Treaty of Cambray was concluded, and the children of France were sent backe into France with

                  Madame Elianor. The King and the Pope by Embassies came to an agreement at Marsilles, where the Marriage of Henry Duke of Orleance, with the Countesse of Bologne, the Popes Niece, was solemnized.
               After this the King sent the Lord of Montmorency against the Emperour, who intended to come against Marsilles, who enforced him to retire into Spaine, and afterwards invaded France upon the Coast of Picardy, and sent another Army to Piedmount, against whom the King sent his forces, which tooke Suse, Villane, and Montcalier, which caused the truce of Nice for ten yeares, during which the Emperour passed through France into Flanders. In the meane time Caesar Fregose and Anthony Rincon the Kings Embassadours to the Turke, were slaine by the Imperialists. Whereupon the King according with the Duke of Cleve against the Emperour, tooke Luxembourg, Landrecy and other

places: Of which the Emperour being certified, besieged Landrecy, but in vaine. On the other side the Lord of Anguyen, the Kings Lievtenant in Piedmont, having gained the battaile of Cerisolles, tooke Carignan: whereof the Emperour being advertised, made a preparation against Paris, but perceiving the French too powerfull in forces, demanded a Peace, which was published at Paris. This being done, the King intends a Warre against the English at Boulen, with whom having made Peace, hee went to pay his debt to Nature at Rambouillet, the last of March, 1547, and lyes interred at St. Denis. To one that desired pardon for another that had used ill speeches of his Majesty, this King said, Let him for whom thou art a suiter, learne to speake little, and I will learne to pardon much. At Paris in an Oration against Hereticks, hee said: If my arme were infected with that contagion, I would cut it off from

my body, and cast it into the fire. Hee said that hee was sorry that the Gentlemen of his Realme being most serviceable, and ingenious, were not qualified with Learning, to be capable of Civill offices as well as Military, since Vertue is the formall cause of Gentility, which should exceed base low dispositions, by an eminent exaltation of goodnesse, deriving their pettigree from Heaven, for Vera est Nobilitas quaedam cognatio Dijs, True Nobility is a certaine affinity to the Gods. A Treaty of peace being propounded, and ready to bee concluded betweene the Emperour Charles the fift and this King Francis, hee said: Peace and amity betweene us cannot long endure, for the Emperour cannot abide an Equall or Companion, and I cannot endure a Master.

                     HEnry the second succeeding to the Crowne on his birth day, was consecreted at Rheimes in August 1547. Hee sent the Lord of Esse into Scotland, for a defence ofthat Countrey, and built a Fort over against that of Boullen: immediately after

the Commons of Guienne mutined upon taxations whilst the King was in Piedmont, from whence, being upon his returne into France, he caused them to be punished by the Constable, and made his enterance into Paris: proclaimed open warres against England, and renewed his allyance with the Swisses. Pope Iulius the third being incensed against the King for the City of Parma, solicited the Emperour to take up Armes against him, and to beleaguer Parma and Mirandula: whereupon the King made a prohibition of sending to the Court of Rome for matters of Benefices; and in the meane time he tooke Quiers, S. Damian, and other places of Piedmont: on the other side the Burgundions, and Hannuyers overrunne the Countrey of Santois, above Peronne: but to requite them, the King making an expedition into Almany, by the policy of the Constable seezd of the Metz, and the Countrey of Messin, and

tooke the Duke &amp; Dutchy of Loraine into his protection: Afterwards hee joyned forces with Duke Maurice, who falsifying his faith in his returne invaded the Dutchy of Luxembourg, taking the Townes of Tvoy, Montmedy, Lumes, and Civay. In the meane time the Emperor marched to the siege of Metz, whence he was forced to dis-encampe with the losse of 30000 men, and threw himselfe upon Therouenne, which he tooke with the Castle of Hedin. The King on the other side tooke Mariembourg, and other Townes in Piedmont. After that the Emperour quitting the Empire, retired himselfe into Spaine, to live a solitary life, and a peace for five yeares was concluded between the Emperour, the Kings of England and France, which continued not long. For warres being renewed betweene the said Kings, the day of St. Laurence, to the losse of the French: in revenge whereof the King tooke Cales, Gnines,
                  
                  Hames, and the County of Oye: Peace after being made by the marriage betweene King Philip, and the Lady Elizabeth of France, and of the Duke of Savoy, with Madam Margarite, sister to the King; and in the continuance of the solemnity, the King running at Tilt, was hit in the eye, of which hurt he dyed at Tournells, the twentieth day of Iuly, Anno Domini 1559. and lyes interred at St. Denis in France.
               
               This King having the good inclination of his Nature confirmed, by being well brought up under his Father, ordained many good Lawes for the reforming apparrell, providing for the poore, maintenance of Justice, and releeving his oppressed Subjects; but especially hee made a Law against swearing and blaspheming, and herein he did singularly well: but he disgraced these good actions, by permitting a bloody and fatall Combate, betwixt

                  Iarnac and Chastaignery, Gentlemen, upon the giving the lye, performed at St. German in Lay on the sixeteenth of July, before the King and divers Princes and Noblemen, wherein Jarnac, held the weaker, got the better, and gave the other many deadly wounds whereof he dyed; whereupon the King did forbid all Combats.
               Thus hee beganne his reigne with this Tragedy, and ended it with his owne; For at the marriage of Elizabeth of France, the King having published a solemne running at the Tilt, (as is before mentioned) the King would needes be one of the Challengers, and the second day of the Tourny, being perswaded by the Queene, and the Duke of Savoy to retire out of the Lists, he desired to runne once more against the Earle of Montgomery, who first refused, but afterward runne, and upon the Kings Helmet broke his

Lance, and with a splinter thereof (his Beaver being somewhat open) strikes him so deepe in the eye, so that he dyed in his house at Tournells, in the 44. yeare of his age. The day before his death he would have the Duke of Savoy and the Lady Margaret his sister marryed in his Chamber. His heart was interred in the Celestines Church, in the Duke of Orleans his Chappell. His Character was good, but hee was formerly voluptuous, and permitted himselfe to be abused by his Officers, selling Lawes and his authority. For such Kings are but pictures of Princes without life, all power remaining in the subject, to the oppression and wrong of the Land.

Arch-Bishop of that See: after his Coronation, he went to conduct his Brother in law the Duke of Loraine, and the Dutchesse Claudia his sister as farre as Barle Duke: from whence hee returned into France, and sojourned for a while in the City of Blois, where he reformed some abuses of those that followed his Court. In the meane time this President Minard was slaine in his owne House, returning from Court: This murther was a cause that it was forbidden to carry trucheons and weapons. The Counsellor of Bourg was burnt for his Religion. The King having made preparations, sent the Lord of Martigues into Scotland, for the suppression of some Scots, who upon pretext of Religion were in Armes: during which time, Mary of Loraine Dowager of Scotland deceased. At the same time also certaine Gentlemen of France, being assembled in Armes neare the City of Amboise,
                  
where the King was attended by the Cardinall of Loraine, and his brother, the Duke of Guise, were discovered in a certaine enterprise, which they pretended to be for the publicke good, and for the dispossessing of some strangers, usurpers of the Kings authority, and Kingdome, contrary to the ancient authority of the three Estates of France; and also for making some remonstrances to the King concerning Religion: for which many were executed to death, amongst whom the Baron of Castelnau was one. At that time the Chancellour Oliver deceased, in whose place and dignity was instituted Monsieur de'l Hospital. Shortly after the King went to Orleans, there to settle himselfe, where he fell sicke of an Apostume in his left eare, whereof he dyed the foureteenth of September, Anno Domini 1560. having reigned about eighteen months and twenty dayes, and lyes interred at S. Denis.
               
               
                  The Protestants were very much persecuted in this Kings reigne, and there were foure prisoners of especiall note, Castelnau, Villemongis, Campagnac, and le Picard, who cryed out against the Chancellor that had signed the sentence of their deaths, who thereupon fell suddenly sicke, and when the Cardinall of Loraine came to visit him, cryed out: O Cardinall thou hast damned us all. While the King lay dangerously sicke, the Queene mother intending to support the Guisans, called the King of Navarre into her closet, to whom, as he was going a Lady of the Court said: My Lord, deny the Queen mother nothing that she shall demand, else you are dead: whereupon he signed what shee desired, and thereby obtained her favour. Afterward the King dyed of Catarch and a Feaver the 14. of December, whose seeds of vertue lay hid in his nature, and were not discerned, onely some shewes of courtesie, modesty, and

continency were in his younger yeares apparent, and rherefore his death was not much lamented, but of such as in his nonage possessed usurped estates. After his decease the Prince of Conde turned the streame of affaires. To give a briefe Character of this King and his reigne, he was a picture of Majesty drawne in raw colours, being young in yeares and judgement, governed by his Mother, and his wives Uncles. The Princes of Blood were in his reigne not regarded, power and might prevailed in Court, and the Clergy sought protection from the disturbers of France. The Nobility were ingaged in warres, and the people divided in matters of Religion, and in the Court factions were maintained: this was the face and complexion of those times; miseries incident to the minority of Princes.

                  THis Charles the ninth, at the Age of thirteene, succeeded his Brother Francis. Hee pursu'd the enterprises of his Predecessor, for his State affaires, which

were begunne the eighth of December' Anno Domini 1560. at Orleans, and and afterward finished at Pontoise, Angust and September following, Anno Domini 1561. At that time hee assembled the Prelates of France at Possi to a Nationall Counsell. The January following it was permitted to the Hugnenots to make their exercises and Sermons out of the Cities. Whereupon ensued great troubles, warres, and slaughters of great Lords and personages, as of the King of Navarre, who was slaine before Rouen; and in the battaile of Dreux, which was given the 19. of March, Anno Domini 1562. the Martiall of St. Andrew, and the Duke of Guise were slaine before Orleans. A while after, the Towne of Haure de Grace was recovered, which had beene before yeelded to the English. The King at the Parliament at Rouen, being declared Mayor, after an Edict of Pacification made, went to visit his Kingdome,

                  Anno domini 1564. and went to meet his sister, the Queene of Spaine, at▪ 
                  Bayonne, where great magnificences were parformfd. After having visited the Gascogne. Guienne, and Poitou, he came to Moulins, where he made many excellent Ordinances. The second civill warre sprung up, wherein, after that the King had made an escape out of Meaux, the battaile of St. Denis was fought, wherein the Constable was wounded, which was a cause of another Pacification, by reason of the siege of Chartres, which was broken by the third intestine warre, which continutwo yeares space; during which, the ed battaile of Iarnac was fought, wherein the Prince of Conde was slaine; and another battaile at Montcontour. After which, another Edict of Pacification was made, Anno Domini 1570. Afterwards the King marryed the Lady Elizabeth of Austria, daughter to the Emperour Maximilian. Also the marriage

of the King of Navarre was celebrated Anno Domini 1573. and the 24. of August, the same yeare the Admirall was slaine in Paris, with a great number of the Hugoueotes and Rochelle was besieged. Then a fourth pacification by the election in Poland of the Duke of Aniou, brother to the King, was made: he being gone in his Kingdome of Poland, was certified of his brother, the Kings, death on the 30. of May, at the Bois de Vincennes, 1574. having one daughter who dyed an Infant. He lyes at St. Denis.
               
               Hee was a Prince that had excellent naturall gifts, but blended and mingled with vices, wherewith his Governours and Schoolemasters had corrupted his young minde, which at the first was more vertuously inclined, delighting in Musick and Poetry. But as he was a great Hunter, that lov'd to shed the blood of wilde beasts, so hee suffered also (during his reigne) the Protestants

blood to be shed, and in revenge thereof in his sicknesse before his death great store of blood issued out by vomiting, and by other passages of his body, in the two last weekes of his sicknesse, wherein he endured as much paine and torment, as the strength of youth could suffer in the last pangs of death. And this judgement shewed that God loves not the Prince that thirsts after his subjects blood, which is the very blood of the Prince. Some few houres before his death he said: It was a great comfort unto him that he left no heire Male lawfully begotten; for leaving him young, he must endure many crosses, and France had neede of a man.

consecrated at Rheims February the 13. Anno Dom. 1575, and the 15. of the same Moneth he marryed Madam Loyse of Loraine, Daughter of the Count of Vaudemont. After in the yeare 1576, he convocated his Statesmen to Blois, where singular good Statutes were enacted. Anno Domini 1577. there was an Edict of Pacification published for the quiet of his Kingdome. He began the foundation of the Augustines Bridge Anno Dom. 1578. The Order of the Knights of the Holy Ghost was by him instituted, Anno Dom. 1579. After his Edict of Pacification, untill the decease of his onely brother Monsieur the Duke of Aniou his Kingdome was in peace: but soone after, Anno Domini 1585, there grew up a faction pernicious to him and his Estate, which was called the Ligue, or the holy Union, the Author whereof was the King of Spaine, purposely to hinder Henry King of Navarre from his accesse to the Crowne of

                  France, to whom after the decease of this King, it of right did belong. This Faction was violated under a colour of Religion, which was of such a force, that the Principality thereof made sure of the primest Cities in the whole Kingdome, their owne, and amongst the rest, Paris it selfe: the Inhabitants whereof having barricadoed themselves against their King on the twelfth of May, Anno Domini 1588, he was constrained to retire himselfe to Chartres, and thence to Rouen. In the end the second time he assembled his men of State at Blois, at the end whereof hee caused the Duke and Cardinall of Guise to bee executed. Upon which execution Paris revolted, together with the prime Cities of the Realme, and the Rebells made the Duke of Mayenne to bee their Chiefe: which was a cause that the King removed his Parlement to Tours in March, in the yeare 1589, and being reconciled to the King of Navarre, he went to beleaguer

                  Paris, and being at St. Claud, on the first day of August hee was most trayterously stabbed with a knife in the bottome of his belly by a Jacobin, of which wound hee dyed the day following in that siege in the midst of his Army, having reigned 15. yeares and two Moneths. His Corps was conducted to Compaigne, where it remaineth to this day entombed.
               This King plotting before his receiving the Crowne, how to ruine the Hugenots, the Emperour told him, that there was no greater sinne than to force mens consciences; for such as thinke to command them, supposing to winne Heaven, doe often lose that which they possesse on Earth. He was at last murdered (as was said) by a Jacobin Fryar, who as the King bended downe to heare in private that which he expected, drew a knife out of his sleeve made a purpose, and thrust his Majesty into the bottome of the belly, and there leaves the knife

in the wound: The murderer was by those which ranne to helpe the King, presently killed. But the King lived awhile, and at his death hee advised them to unite themselves in revenging his murder, but yet he forgave his enemies, and charged them to seeke the preservation of the Realme, by purging out Faction. And lastly hee wished them to referre the difference of Religion to the Convocation of the Estates of the Realme, saying that Piety is a duty of man to God, over which worldly force hath no power. The Picture of his minde was faire and lovely, being drawne with the lines of wit, eloquence, gravity, devotion, affection to learning, bountifull to desert, reforming abuses, peaceable and willing to heare counsell, but this comely beauty was disgraced by a pale weaknesse in adversity, a smiling wantonnesse, and too liberall a prodigality, which somewhat blemished this Prince, who had otherwise beene

an exact peece of perfection, worthy to be placed among the chiefest Monarchs.
            
            
               
                  Henry the 4, the 63. King of France. Anno 1589.

                  THis Henry the fourth, surnamed the Great, King of Navarre, as first of the Bourbon line, being descended from Robert, the last sonne of

                  St. Lewis, succeeded to the Crowne of France by consent and assistance of the Nobility, and Army of the late Henry, by whose deplored death it was dispersed, retired himselfe to Dieppe, where he was besieged by the Duke of Mayenne with a potent Army, which by this King was routed, with a small number of Arques the 21. of September, Anno Domini 1589. And from thence pursued his victory even to Paris, taking the Suburbs thereof upon All-Hallows Eve. Afterwards hee recovered Vendosm le Mans and Falaise.
               
               The fourteenth of March 1590, hee obtained the famous victory of Yury, after which hee blocked up Paris and St. Denis, and reduced them to such an extremity of famine, that in July following St. Denis yeelded it selfe to his power, and Paris also was upon the point of surrender. April, 1591. the City of Chartres after a long siege was yeelded up also to him.
               
                  
                  Ianuary, 1593. began the Estates of the Ligue at Paris, and the Truce of Suresne followed, which being in dispute the King tooke the City of Dreux, and shortly after he was instructed in the Roman Faith, whereof hee made a publique and solemne profession at St. Denis, the 25. of July. August following the generall Truce began, and continued untill the first day of the yeare 1594, which being expired, the King caused himselfe to be crowned at Chartres by the Bishop of that See, the 27. of February. Hereupon ensued the submission of Meaux, Lyons, Orleance, Bourges, Rouen and Paris, where the King was most magnificently entertained.
               A while after the City of Laon was besieged, and yeelded up to the King, and upon that Champagne and Picardy also submitted, yea, and the Duke of Guise. The King being returned to Paris, was stabbed in the face with a knife by a young desperate Student

called John Chastel, who for that fact was deservedly torne in pieces with wilde Horses the 29. of December.
               
               The King being recovered of his hurt, made Knights of the Holy Ghost, in January, 1595. After the City of Dijon submitted, and in a manner all Burgundy. Also the second generall Truce was published, and in the interim the reconciliation of the Duke of Mayenne was wrought, together with those of the Dukes of Toyeuse and Espernon.
               
               In the beginning of the yeare 1596, the City of Marsilles was surrendred to the King, and to the Duke of Guise, Governour of Provence: Hee also after eight Moneths siege, tooke the Towne of La Fere in Picardy about mid May, notwithstanding the resistance of the Spanish forces then under the Conduct of the Arch-Duke of Austria, who came purposely out of Flanders to raise that siege.
               At Rouen in a generall assembly of the

Peeres of France, the Alliance between him and Queene Elizabeth of England was renewed by Embassages extraordinary in October, when the King received from her the Order of St. George, (aliàs) the Garter, as, not long before, the Order of the Chevalry or Knighthood of France was sent unto the Queen of England, by Monsieur the Marshall of Bouillon.
               
               
                  Anno Domini 1599. the King made ordinary Knights of the Holy Ghost at Rouen, which was never there done before, at any other place than at Paris.
               
               Not long after, the Towne of Amiens was taken by the Spaniards, and cruelly pillaged for the space of 5. daies, and the French beaten out. The King resolved upon a revenging siege, and to that end caused it to be encompassed by Monsieur the Marshall of Biron and his Troops for the impeachments of all manner of supplies: and the King in person the 21. of May marched towards

the said siege of Amiens, which after many furious assaults, Sallies, and Skirmishes, was surrendred upon composition upon Thursday the 25. of September, notwithanding that the Cardinall of Austria came even to the Trenches with an Army of 18000. foot, and 2000 Horse, with 18. Cannons for Battery, but was valiantly beaten backe, and intercepted of his designe of relieving the City, and enforced to a shamefull retreate, with the losse of a great part of his men.
               The same yeare the Marriage of the King with Madam Margaret of France for many strong and lawfull causes was annulled and made void, and by the Authority of Pope Clement the eight, was so published.
               The yeare 1600. the Marriage of the King was treated, and concluded with the Lady Mary of Medicis, Princesse of Florence, Daughter of the late Great Duke of Tuscany, Francis of Medicis,
                  
and of Joane of Austria, Daughter of the Emperour Ferdinand, and in May shee in her owne Countrey was proclaimed Queene of France.
               
               The 13. of June 1602. Charles Duke of Biron, and Lord High Marshall of France, being come to Fontainbleau, was arrested upon high Treason by the Kings command, and from thence conveyed to the Bastile at Paris. Hee was convicted by his Peeres for attempts against the Kings Person and State, and upon the Munday before, being the 29. of July, hee was adjudged to lose his head, with the confiscation of his goods, and the land of Biron deprived for ever of being a Dutchy and Pairy of France, and was reunited to the Crowne.
               It was pleaded against him, Qui nec virtute nec fide prodest, prosit exemplo: He that can never profit by his vertue, nor his loyalty, must profit by his example; and thereupon he was condemned, and

put into the said Bastile, whither the Chancellour comming to pronounce the sentence of death against him, hee shaked the Chancellour by the Arme, saying, You have judged me, and God will absolve me; hee will lay open their iniquities, which have shut their eyes, because they would not see my innocency: You my Lord shall answer for this injustice before him, whither I doe summon you within a yeare and a day. I goe before by the judgment of men, but those that are the cause of my death, shall come after by the judgment of God. Afterward he said, I see well that I am not the most wicked, but I am the most unfortunate. Those that have done worse than I would have done, are favoured, the Kings Clemency is dead for me. He doth not imitate Caesar nor Augustu, or those great Princes, who not onely pardoned the intention of doing ill, but the Act; and wherein can the King shew himselfe greater than in

pardoning? Clemency is a Kingly vertue; every one may give Death, but it belongs onely to Soveraignty to give life: But the Chancellour told him, that a condemned man must not dispute against his Judgment, whereupon the Duke of Biron delivered up the Kings order. Afterward the Chancellour said that hee had brought two Divines to comfort him, and prepare him for death, but the Duke said, That he was already prepared, and that his soule was in such tranquillity, as the night before hee had spoken with God. Within few daies after he was beheaded, and his body interred by night in the Church of S. Paul.
               
               The yeare 1604. the King was advertised that one Nicholas l'Hoste, Secretary of State, discovered to the King of Spaine, (from whom he received an annuall Pension to that end) the secrets and affaires of the State: upon the notice taken L'Hoste put himselfe in flight for his owne safety, but he was so closely

followed and pursued, that he was enforced to hide himselfe in the River of Marne, where he dyed through cold and feare. His body being found, was condemned to bee drawne in peeces with wilde horses, and the foure quarters to be set upon foure wheeles at foure gates of Paris. The yeare 1610. there were taken out of the Arsenal of Paris Fifty great Gunnes, with store of Munition of powder and shot, and great numbers of Souldiers were leavied.
               The King intended shortly after to enter into his Army, but he would first see his Queene should bee crowned at St. Denis, which was performed with great solemnity. But the next day after this Magnificence and pompe of the Queenes Coronation, this great King was on Friday the 14. of May, 1610. about foure in the afternoone most trayterously murthered in his Caroch with two stabbs with a knife neare the region of his heart, passing in the Streete of the

                  Ferronery, neare the Charnells of the Innocents Church-yard, by Francis Ravaillac, borne in Angolesme. His Obsequies were performed the three dayes following, the 21, 22, 23. of June, with infinite teares and lamentations: and after many funebriall solemnities, his Corps was conducted to St. Denis, where it remaineth interred.
               He lived fifty sixe yeares, and thirty one daies. Hee reigned in Navarre Thirty seven yeares, eleaven moneths, or thereabout; and in France Twenty yeares, nine moneths, and thirteene dayes.

                     LEwis the 13. at his age of eight yeares, seven Moneths, and seventeene dayes, succeeded his Father Henry the Great, and the fifteenth of May, Anno Domini 1610. he

sate personally in the Court of Parliament, then sitting at the Augustines, where, in the presence of the Queene his mother, who sate by him of the one side, foure Cardinalls, foure Ecclesiasticall Peeres of France, some Princes of the Blood, and other Princes, who met in that assembly; also of the Constable, with many Dukes and secular Peeres, of the Marshalls of France, and Officers of the Crowne, of Governours of Provinces, of Presidents and Counsellors of the Parliament, he by the Mouth of the Lord Sillery his Chancellour declared his Mother to be Regent in France, that shee might have the tuition of his person, and the administration of the affaires of his Kingdome, during his minority, with all authority and power, according to the charge of that Court given the day before.
               The same Moneth the criminall indictment was preferred against the most inhumane Parricide, Francis Ravaillac,
                  
and on the 23. of May, he was declared guilty, and justly attainted, and convicted of the crime of Laesae Majestatis in the highest degree, in the great Court and Chamber of Turnella in Paris, before all the Assemblies, Presidents, Counsellours, and Commissioners, at the request of Du Viquit, Atturney Generall to the King, whose place and authority was there then to inquire against this Francis Ravaillac, for the murther of his late Soveraigne Henry the fourth, King of France and Navarre: Whereupon this Ravaillac with a sad and death-like countenance, holding up his guilty hand before this great assembly, presently confessed guilty; and that he became this his Countries shame, onely by the instigation of the Divell; and not any other accomplices and confederates would he reveale, but in a Satanicall manner vowed himselfe to secresie; and being found guilty, he was with a strong guard of armed men

conveyed to prison, which otherwise by the violence and rage of the common people, had beene torne in peeces, such was their love they owed to their late King: for which Fact he was condemned to pay his forfeit before the great gate of our Lady Church in Paris, and thence to be conveyed to the place of execution; and in the meane time, to make him confesse, he was to be pinched with hot Pincers upon his breasts, armes, buttocks, thighes, and the Calves of his legges; his right hand to be burnt off with fire of brimstone, with an order, that in those places where hee was so pinced, melted Lead should be powred, boyling Oyle, Pitch, Rozen, Waxe, and Brimstone, melted altogether. This being done, that his body should be torne in pieces, and dismembred by foure horses, and that his Limbes should be burnt and consumed to ashes, and cast into the winde; all his goods to be confiscate to the King: that the house

wherein he was borne, should be demolished, and never any Edefice upon that ground to be built: that within fifteene dayes after the publication of this sentence in the towne of Angolesme, his Father and Mother should depart the Realme, and never returne againe, upon paine of being hanged, without any other proceedings: It was also forbidden in the aforesaid High Court, that his brothers, sisters uncles, and all others that beare the name of Ravaillac, to whom it was enjoyned to change it into another name, upon the same penalty: All which was published and put in execution the same day, by the order of the whole assembly in the aforesaid Court in Paris: but before I conclude, I will speake againe of the manner of his death; because in that place I will not omit some things more worthy of note.
               Afterwards it was provided for the Funeralls and obsequies of the dead

King, and then the body of the late Henry the third was removed from the Towne of Compeigne to be interred at St. Denis; which was performed, and the heart of this Henry the Great, at the same time was carryed to the Jesuites at la Flech.
               
               The Sorbone renewed the Decree of the Councell of Constance against Paracides of Kings, and by the Court of Parliament upon the Iuine, it condemned a Book of Iohn Mariana, one of the Society, a Spaniard intituled De Rege &amp; Regis institutione, and caused it to be burnt by the Executioner before our Ladies Church.
               
               The Martiall de la Chastra, being sent with an Army of twelve thousand foot, and two thousand Horse to Tulliers, which he took the second of September.
               
               Divers Embassadors came to Paris to the King, to bemoane and condole with him the death of his father: and

                  King Iames of England sent unto him the Order of the Garter, which he received the foureteenth of September.
               
               The 17. of October the King was consecrated at Rheimes, and the next day he received the Order of the Holy Ghost; and he gave the Order to the Prince of Conde, and returned to Paris, where he was magnificently entertained.
               The sixe and twentieth of November it was proceeded and decreed in the Court of Parliament against a Booke of Cardinall Bellarmine, touching the Popes authority In Temporalibus, which was forbidden to be printed, to be sold, or kept, upon paine of High Treason.
               The seventeenth day of November, Anno Domini 1611. the Duke of Orleans, brother to the King, deceased at St. Germane en Lay, and his body was conveyd to St. Denis in France.
               
               
                  The Lord of Vatan made a kinde of a Rebellion in Berry, whereupon his Castle was taken, and he carryed to Paris, where he was beheaded the second, of January, Anno Domini 1612.
               This yeare were solemnized the marriages of the King with the Lady Anne Infanta of Spaine, and of the Kings Sister, with the Prince of Spaine.
               
               The yeare 1614 the Prince of Conde retired himselfe to Paris, and the Marquesse D'Ancre was made Marshall of France.
               
               The Statue of Brasse of Henry the Great, was by the great Duke of Tuscany sent to Paris, and placed with the Horse of Brasse, upon the midst of the New Bridge; And about that time the Prince of Conty dyed.
               The Prince distasted with the Kings espousalls with the Queene at Burgos, made a hurly burly in the Countrey,

but the Espousalls being ended, the Duke of Guise with a strong Army conducted her to Fontarable, where shee was received by the Spaniards, and an exchange being made, the Queene was by the said Duke conveyed to Bourdeaux, where shee was most magnificently entertained by the King, where hee expected her, and the Nuptials were celebrated on St. Katharines day.
               The yeare 1616. such was the rigour of cold weather in January, that the Rivers were frozen, and the yce was the cause of the fall of St. Michaels at Paris.
               
               The 16. of August, the taking of Peronne was a cause of new commotions, and the first of September was apprehended at the Louure, and after kept under a strong guard in the Bastile.
               
               Many of the Lords retired from the Court, as the Duke of Vendosme, of Nevers, of Guise, of Mayenne, and Bovillon, with other Lords, whereof some returned againe, the others not: which was

a cause that the King in Parliament declared the causes wherefore he kept the Prince his brother in hold.
               In the beginning of the yeare 1617. he made a Declaration against the Duke of Nevers in Parliament, the 17. of January, also in February against the Dukes of Vendosme, Mayenne, Bouillon, the Marquesse of Caevure, and the President le Jay. Also another Declaration was made in March for the re-union to his Domaines, and a Confiscation of the goods of the said Nobility upon the 16. of the said Moneth.
               This King succeeded after the Tragicall death of his Father, when great troubles were like to follow; but all those clouds were blowne away, and this young Prince shined forth like the Sun in a cleare skie. First of all hee went to the Parliament, and made a Declaration that his Mother should be Queene Regent during his minority. Afterward the Jesuites received his Fathers

heart, with great Ceremony, being received into La Flech. Here the Arraignment and cruell Execution of the Murtherer Ravilliac deserves to be drawne forth in blacke colours. Imagine that Ravilliac was first arraign'd after he had beene put to the Rack, then condemned, afterward hee was brought out of the prison in his shirt, with a Torch of two pound weight lighted in one hand, and the knife wherewith he had murdered the King, chained to the other: then he was set upright in a Dung-cart, now hee is doing pennance at our Ladies Church; now imagine the raging people are ready to teare him in peeces, but the Officers restraine them; the Murderer came to the Scaffold, he crosses himselfe in signe that he dyed a Papist; hee was bound to a St. Andrews Crosse, then his fatall hand with the knife chained to it, smoaks in a Furnace of fire and brimstone; it is consum'd, yet hee will not confesse any thing, but roare and cry like

to a Soule in hell, but yet unpitied: and then his flesh was pulld off with hot Pincers, and burnt, then scalding Oyle, Rozen, pitch, and brimstone, melted together, were powr'd into his wounds, and on his navell a roundell of Clay was set, into the which they powred molten Lead, and then he roared, but confessed nothing. At last, to conclude this Tragedy, his body was torne in pieces with foure strong Horses, which could not plucke them asunder, being so firmely knit together, untill the flesh under his armes and thighes was cut. In this manner was this Paricide tormented and executed, being the horrid picture of a Traytor, suffering extreame tortures, yet misery nor death could not enforce from him any confession. And surely if Hells tortures might be felt on earth, it was approved in this mans punishment, yet he would reveale nothing, but that he did it by the instigation of the Devil, and his maine reason was, because the

King tollerated two Religions in his Kingdome. Oh small occasion, that for this cause one servile slave should thu quench the great light of France, whose brightnesse glistred thorow Europe: One thing this Villaine confessed, that of all the severall torments that were invented and laid upon him, none was more terrible to him, than his losse of sleepe for sixe dayes and nights together, for there were appointed severall officers by turnes to keepe him waking, by thrusting red-hot bodkins into his breasts and sides; so that if he did but offer to winke or give a nod, then presently they awaked him with those Irons. He was torne in peeces as I said before, and his bones burnt, the ashes whereof were scattered in the winde, as being thought unworthy of the earths buriall. This Ravaillac was borne at Angolesme, and by profession a Lawyer, and was perswaded as it is thought, by the Jesuites to perpetrate this bloody act, by

murdering this Kings Father, Henry the fourth, the hope of Learning, and the glory of Armes. Afterward the Duke of Fener, Embassadour from Spaine, came to Paris, and being brought into the Kings presence, he said that he came from the King his Master to visite his Majesty. This young Prince answered, I thanke the King my brother for his good will, I will remember him and you also: Seeing he desires it, he may expect from me all friendship and good intelligence, such as hee had with the deceased King my Father. Afterward the Lord Wotton, Embassadour from England, came to Paris, and then Embassadours for confirmation of mutuall league being sent into Spaine, England, and to Rome, the King was at Rheims with solemne pompe and great state crowned.
