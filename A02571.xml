            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                  PHARISAISME AND CHRISTIANITY: Compared and ſet forth in a Sermon at Pauls Croſſe, May 1. 1608. By I. H. Vpon MATTH. 5.20. Except your righteouſneſſe exceed the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſeis, you ſhall not enter into the kingdome of heauen.

                     I Know there is ſtore of Sermons extant; The pulpit ſcarce affordeth more than the Preſſe. I adde

to the number, and complaine not: In all good things abundance is an eaſie burden. If the ſoule may feed it ſelfe with varietie, both by the eare, and by the eie, it hath no reaſon to finde fault with choice. But if any weaker ſtomack (as in our bodily Tables) ſhall feare to ſurfet at the ſight of too much, it is eaſie for that man to looke off, and to confine his eies to ſome few: who cannot much ſooner abate to himſelfe, than multiplie to another? Let not his nice ſullenneſſe preiudice that delight and profit which may ariſe to others from this number. For mee, I dare not bee ſo enuious, as not to bleſſe God for this plentie, and ſeriouſly to reioice that Gods people may thus liberally feaſt

themſelues by both their ſenſes: neither know I for whether more; The ſound of the word ſpoken pierceth more, the letter written endureth longer; the eare is taught more ſuddenly, more ſtirringly: the eie with leaſure and continuance. According to my poore ability I haue deſired to doe good both waies, not ſo much fearing cenſures, as caring to edifie. This little labour ſubmiſſelie offers it ſelfe to your Lordſhip, as iuſtlie yours: being both Preached at your call, and (as it were) in your charge, and by one vnder the charge of your fatherly iuriſdiction, who vnfainedlie deſires by all meanes to ſhew his true heart to Gods Church,

together with his humble thankefulneſſe to your Lordſhip; and profeſſeth ſtill to continue

                  The Iewes of theſe times

peruerted the Law, reiected the Goſpell. Our Sauior therfore that great Prophet of the World (as it was high time) cleares the Law, deliuers and ſettles the Goſpell: well approuing in both theſe, that hee came not to conſume, but to conſummate the Law.1. Cor. 16.9 Wherein (as Paul to his Corinths) he had a great dore, but many aduerſaries:
                        Ioh. 3. Art thou a Maſter in Iſrael? amongſt theſe were the great maſters of Iſrael (ſo our Sauior termes the Phariſeis) and their fellowes, and yet their riuals, the Scribes: both ſo much harder to oppoſe, by how much their authority was greater.
                  
                     Truth hath no roome till falſhood bee remooued; Our Sauior therefore (as behoued) firſt ſhewes the falſhood of their Gloſſes, and the hollowneſſe of their profeſſion; and if both their life and Doctrine be naught; what free part is there in them? And loe both of theſe ſo faulty, that Except your righteouſneſſe exceed the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſeis, yee ſhall not enter into the kingdome of Heauen.
                  
                  What were the men? What was their righteouſnes? What wanted it? Follow mee, I beſeech you, in theſe three, and if my diſcourſe ſhall ſeeme for

a while, more thornie and perplexed, remedie it with your attention.
                  Thoſe things which are out of the ken of ſenſe or memory, muſt bee fetch't from Story. The Sect (or order whether) of the Phariſeis ceaſſed with the Temple; ſince that, no man reads of a Phariſie; and now is growne ſo farre out of knowledge, that the moderne Iewes are more ready to learne of vs who they were: There is no point, wherein it is more difficult, to auoid variety, yea oſtentation of reading; without any curious trauerſing of opinions, I ſtudy for ſimple truth,

as one that will not lead you out of the rode-way to ſhew you the turnings. Scribes were ancient;Eſr. 6.7. 
                     Eſra is called (Sopher mahir) a prompt Scribe. As long before him, ſoeuer ſince they continued till Chriſts time; but in two rankes; ſome were

                     : Some popular, others legall: Some the peoples, others, Gods: The one Secretaries, Recorders, Notaries, as 2. Chron. 24.11. (Sopher hamelec) the Kings Scribe: The other Doctours of the Law of God:Ier. 8.8. 
                     The Law of the Lord is with vs, in vaine made hee it, the pen of the Scribe is in vaine.
                  
                  As the Phariſeis were (

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ) interpreters of the Law. Tho to ſome not meane Critickes, it ſeems theſe ſhould be a third ſort; which conſider not, that our Sauiour on purpoſe addreſſing his ſpeech to the Phariſeis, fell by the way vpon the Scribes, and being admoniſhed by one of them, as of an ouer-ſight, now auerres right downe of the Scribes, what before he had but indifferently glanced at.Neh. 8.4. Matt. 23.2. Cleric: Iudaeorum: ſaith Ierome. What they were, is plaine by Ezraes pulpit; and Moſes his chaire. Theſe and Phariſeis differed not much; they agreed in ſome

good, but in more euill. But the profeſſion of Phariſeis, becauſe it is more obſcure, you ſhall giue mee leaue to fetch ſomewhat further.

Church; there were two generall, and diuers conceits about Gods ſeruice: One, that tooke vp only with the Law of God; and if they could keepe that, thought they needed no more; neither would they ſapere ſupra ſcriptum; be wiſer then their maker; Theſe were called (Karraim) of which ſort there are diuers at this day in Conſtantinople, and other where, at deadly feode with the other Iewes, which they now call Rabbinistes.
                  
                  The other, that thought it ſmall thanks to doe only what they were bidden; Gods Law was too ſtrait for their holineſſe:

It was nothing, vnleſſe they did more then content God, earne him (for theſe were Popiſh Iewes) and ſupererogate of him. Theſe were therefore called (Chaſidim) Holy: aboue the Law: they plied God with vnbidden oblations, gaue more then needed, did more then was commanded: Yet ſo, as both parts pleaſed themſelues, reſiſted not the other: The more franke ſort vpbraided not the other, with too much niggardlineſſe; neither did the ſtraiter-handed enuie the other for too much lauiſhneſſe. Would God we could doe thus; They agreed tho

they differ'd: But now, when theſe voluntary ſeruices began to be drawne into Canons, (as Scaliger ſpeaketh) and that which was before but arbitrary, was impoſed as neceſſarie, (neceſſary for beleefe, neceſſary for action) queſtions aroſe, and the rent began in the Iews: Thoſe dogmaticall Doctors which ſtond for ſupererogation, and traditions aboue Law, were called (Peruſchim) Phariſeis; ſeparate from the other in ſtrict iudgement, in ſuperfluous holineſſe: Theſe as they were the broode of thoſe (Chaſidim) whom we finde firſt mentioned in the Machabees

by the corrupt name of Aſideans; ſo from them againe,1. Mac. 2.47 in a ſecond ſucceſſion proceeded (as their more refined iſſue) the Eſſens, both Collegiate and Eremiticall: Theſe Phariſeis then, were a fraternitie or Colledge of extraordinarie deuotion; whoſe rule was Tradition, whoſe practiſe voluntarie auſtereneſſe: To them the Scribes ioyned themſelues, as the purer Iewes,

Our blinde forefathers clothed the Church, you deſpoile it: their ignorant deuotion ſhall riſe in iudgement againſt your rauening couetouſneſſe. If robberie, ſimony, periury will not carrie you to hell: hope ſtil that you may be ſaued. They gaue plentifull alms to the poore we in ſtead of filling their bellies, grinde their faces. What excellent Lawes had wee lately enacted that there ſhould bee no begger in Iſrael? Let our ſtreets, waies, hedges witneſſe the execution. Thy liberality relieues ſome poore. It is well. But hath not thy oppreſſion made

more? Thy vſurie, extorting, racking, incloſing, hath wounded whole Villages, and now thou befriendeſt two or three with the plaiſters of thy bountie. The mercies of the wicked are cruell. They were preciſe in their Sabbath, we ſo looſe in ours, as if God had no day: See whether our Tauernes, ſtreetes, hy-waies deſcry anie great difference. Theſe things I vowed in my ſelfe to reproue; if too bitterly, (as you thinke) pardon (I beſeech you) this holie impatience: and blame the fouleneſſe of theſe vices, not my iuſt vehemencie. And you (Chriſtian hearers) than which

no name can be dearer be perſwaded to ranſack your ſecure hearts; and if there bee any of you whoſe awaked conſcience ſtrikes him for theſe ſins, and places him below theſe Iews in this vnrighteouſneſſe, if you wiſh or care to bee ſaued, thinke it hie time, as you would euer hope for entrance into Gods kingdome, to ſtrike your ſelues on the thigh, and with amazement and indignation to ſay, What haue I done? to abandon your wicked courſes; to reſolue, to vow, to ſtriue vnto a Chriſtian and conſcionable reformation.

See now with like patience, their vnrighteouſneſſe that was, and our righteouſneſſe that muſt bee, wherein they failed, and wee muſt exceed. They failed then in their Traditions and Practiſe. May I ſay they failed, when they exceeded? Their Traditions exceeded in number and proſecution, faultie in matter.
                  
                     To run well, but out of the way (according to the Greeke prouerbe) is not better than to ſtand ſtill. Fire is an excellent thing, but if it be in the top of the chimney, it doth miſchiefe rather. It is good to be zealous in ſpight of all ſcoffes,Gal. 4.18. but (

If wee deſired the griefe of our common mother, the languiſhing of the Goſpell, the extirpation of religion, the loſſe of poſterity, the aduantage of our aduerſaries, which way could theſe bee better effected than

                  For the matter of their Traditions our Sauiour hath taxed them in many particulars; about waſhings, oaths, offerings,

retribution: whereof he hath ſaid enough whē he hath termed their doctrine, the Leauen of the Phariſeis, that is, ſowre and ſwelling.Jn Mar. 23.
                      S. Hierome reduces them to two heads: They were Turpia, anilia; ſome ſo ſhamefull that they might not be ſpoken; others idle &amp; dotiſh; both ſo numerous that they cannot be reckned. Take a taſte for all; and to omit their reall traditions, heare ſome of their interpretatiue. The Law was, that no Leper might come into the Temple; their Tradition was, that if he were let downe thorow the roofe, this were no irregularity.Prae. Moſ. cum expoſ. Rab. The Law was, a

man might not carry a burden on the Sabbath; their Traditional gloſſe; if he carried ought on one ſhoulder it was a burden;Ibid. if on both, none. If ſhooes alone, no burden; if with nails, not tolerable.Ibid. Their ſtint of a Sabbaths iourney was a thouſand cubites; their gloſſe was, That this is to bee vnderſtood without the wals, but if a man ſhould walke all day thorow a city as bigge as Nineuie, he offends not. The Church of Rome ſhall vie ſtrange gloſſems and ceremonious obſeruations with them, whether for number or for ridiculouſneſſe. The day would faile mee if I

                  Some of their Rabbins ſay well, that God requires two things concerning his Law, Cuſtody and Worke. Cuſtody in the heart; worke in the execution;

God ſhall once waſh off with riuers of brimſtone. I ſpeake of thy painted ſoule, and thy counterfet obedience. Giue me leaue, (yea let mee take it) to complaine that wee are fallen into a cold and hollow age wherein the religion of manie is but faſhion, and their pietie gilded ſuperſtition; Men care onely to ſeeme Chriſtians; If they can get Gods liuery on their backes, and his name in their mouthes, they out-face all reproofes. How many are there which if they can keepe their Church, giue an almes, bow their knee, ſay their praiers, pay their tithes, and once

Their oſtentation followes; wherein it is ſtrange to conſider, how thoſe that cared not to be good

ſhould deſire yet to ſeeme good: ſo did theſe Phariſeis: They would not faſt without a ſmeared face; not giue an alms without a trumpet; not pray without witneſſes, Scribes, Phariſeis, hypocrites, they did act a religious part, but play deuotion.

                  My ſpeech muſt end in their Couetouſneſſe and Ambition: A paire of hainous vices I ioine them together: for

they are not only brethren, but twins; yet ſo as the elder heere alſo ſerues the yonger. It is ambition that blowes the fire of Couetouſneſſe. Oppreſſion gets wealth; that wealth may procure honour. Why doe men labour to be rich, but that they may be great? Their Couetouſneſſe was ſuch, that their throte (an open ſepulchre) ſwallowed vp whole houſes of Widowes.

If a number of your conſciences were rip't, o ye that would be Chriſtian Gentlemen, Lawyers, Citizens, what doe wee thinke would be found in your maws? Heere the deuoured patrimonie of poore Orphans; there the Cōmons of whole Townſhips: heere the impropriate goods of the Church; there piles of vſurie: heere bribes, and vnlawfull fees; there the raw and indigeſted gobbets of ſimonie: yea would God I might not ſay, but I muſt ſay it

with feare, with ſorrow, euen of our ſacred and diuine profeſſion, that which our Sauior of his twelue, Yee are cleane, but not all. The multitude of our vnregarded charges, and ſouls dying and ſtarued, for want of ſpiritual prouiſion, (while they giue vs bodily) would condemne my ſilence for too partiall. In all conditions of men (for particulars are ſubiect to enuie &amp; exception) the daughters of the horſe-leech had neuer ſuch a fruitfull generation: They crie ſtill, Giue, Giue: Not giue alone, that is, the bread of ſufficiencie, but giue, giue; that is, more than enough. But what

is more than enough? What is but enough? What is not too little for the inſatiable gulfe of humane deſires? Euery man wold ingroſſe the whole world to himſelfe, and with that ambitious conqueror feares it will be too little:Giue me not pouerty nor riches. Prou. 30.8.
                      and how few Agurs are there, that pray againſt too much? From hence it is, that yee Courtiers grate vpon poore trades with hard Monopolies. Hence ye Merchants lode them with deep and vnreaſonable prices, and make thē pay deare for daies. Hence ye great men wring the poore ſponges of the Commonaltie into your priuate purſes; for

the maintenance of pride and exceſſe. Hence ye cormorant corne-mongers hatch vp a dearth in the time of plenty. God ſends graine, but many times the Diuell ſends garners. The earth hath beene no niggard in yeelding: but you haue beene lauiſh in tranſporting, and cloſe in concealing. Neuer talke of our extreame froſts: we ſee Gods hand, and kiſſe the rod; but if your hearts, your charity were not more frozen than euer the earth was, meane houſe-keepers ſhould not need to beg, nor the meaneſt to ſtarue for wāt of bread. Hence laſtly, our loud oppreſſions

of all ſorts cry to heauen, and are anſwered with threats, yea with variety of vengeances. Take this with thee yet, o thou worldling, which haſt the greedy-worm vnder thy tong with Eſaies dogs, and neuer haſt enough. Thou ſhalt meet with two things as vnſatiable as thy ſelfe; the Graue and Hell; and thou, whom all the world could not ſatisfie, there be two things wherof thou ſhalt haue enough: Enough mold in the graue, enough fire in hell.
                  
                  I loue not to end with a iudgement; and as it were to let my Sun ſet in a cloud. We are all Chriſtians, wee ſhould

know the World, what it is, how vaine, how tranſitory, how worthleſſe. Wee know where there are better things, which wee profeſſe our ſelues made for, and aſpiring to: Let vs vſe the world like it ſelfe, and leaue this importunate wooing of it to Heathens and Infidels, that knew no other heauen, no other God; Or if you like that counſell better; Bee Couetous: Be Ambitious. Couet ſpirituall gifts. 1. Cor. 14.1. Neuer thinke you haue grace enough; deſire more, ſeeke for more: this alone is worth your affections, worth your cares: Be ſtill poore in this, that you

                     I Deſire not to make any Apologie for the edition of this my Sermon: It is motiue enough, that herein I affect a more publike, and more induring good, Spirituall niceneſs is the next degree to vnfaithfullneſs: This point cannot be too much vrged, either by the tongue, or preſſe. Religion and our ſoules depend vpon it; yet are our thoughts too much beſide it. The Church of Rome ſo fixes her-ſelfe (in her adoration) vpon the

croſſe of Chriſt, as if ſhee forgat his glorie: Many of vs ſo conceiue of 
                        〈◊〉
                      glorious, that wee neglect the meditation of his Croſſe, the way to his glory, and ours. If wee would proceede aright, we muſt paſſe frō his Golgotha, to the mount of Oliues, and from thence to heauen; and there ſeeke and ſettle our reſt. According to my weake abilitie, I haue led this way in my ſpeech; beſeeching my Readers to follow mee with their hearts, that wee may ouer-take him which is entred into the true ſanctuarie, euen the higheſt heauens, to appeare now in the ſight of God for vs.

Not this prediction onely of his laſt draught; as Auguſtine: that were too particular. Let our Sauiour himſelfe ſay; All things that are written of me by the Prophets. It is a ſure and conuertible rule; Nothing was done by Chriſt which vvas not foretold; nothing was euer fore-told by the Prophets of Chriſt, which was not done. It wold take vp a life, to compare the Prophets and Euangeliſts; the predictions and the hiſtory; &amp; largely to diſcourſe, how the one fore-tells, and the other anſwers: let it ſuffice to looke at them, running. Of all the Euangeliſts, S. Mathew hath bin moſt ſtudious, in making theſe references

and correſpondences: with whom, the burden or vnderſong of euerie euent, is ſtill (vt impleretur.) That it might be fulfilled. Thus hath he noted (if I haue reckoned thē aright) two and thirty ſeueral prophecies cōcerning Chriſt; fulfilled in his birth, life, death:

                     To which, S. Iohn adds many more. Our ſpeech muſt bee directed to his Paſsion: omitting the reſt, let vs inſiſt in thoſe. He muſt be apprehended: it vvas fore-prophecied; The Anointed of the Lord was taken in their nets, ſaith Ieremy: But how? He muſt be ſold; for what? thirtie ſiluer peeces: and what muſt thoſe do? Buy a field: all foretold; And they tooke thirty ſiluer peeces, the price of him that was valued, &amp; gaue them for the Potters field, ſaith Zachary (miſwritten Ieremy; by one letter miſtaken in the abbreuiation). By whom? that child of perdition, that the Scripture might bee fulfilled. Which was hee? It is

fore-told; He that eateth bread with me, ſaith the Pſalmiſt. And what ſhall his diſciples do? Run away; ſo ſaith the prophecie: J will ſmite the Shepheard, and the ſheepe ſhall be ſcattered, ſaith Zachary. What ſhall bee done to him? He muſt be ſcourged and ſpit vpon: behold, not thoſe filthy excremēts could haue light vpon his ſacred face without a prophecie; J hid not my face frō ſhame and ſpitting, ſaith Eſay. What ſhal be the iſſue? In ſhort; he ſhall be led to death: it is the prophecie; The Meſsias ſhal be ſlaine, ſaith Daniel. What death? He muſt be lift vp; Like as Moſes lift vp the Serpent in the wilderneſſe: ſo ſhall the ſonne of man

bee lift vp. Chryſoſtome ſaith well, that ſome actions are parables; ſo may I ſay, ſome actions are prophecies: ſuch are all types of Chriſt: &amp; this with the formoſt. Lift vp? Whither? To the Croſſe: it is the prophecie; Hanging vpon a tree,
                     
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . ſaith Moſes. How lift vp? Nayled to it: ſo is the prophecie; Foderunt manus, they haue pierced my hāds and my feet, ſaith the Pſalmiſt. with what cōpany? two thieues; With the wicked was hee nūbred, ſaith Eſay: Where? without the gates, ſaith the prophecie. What becomes of his garments? they cannot ſo much as caſt the dice for his coate, but it is prophecied; They diuided my garments,

and on my veſtures caſt lots, ſaith the Pſalmiſt. He muſt die then on the Croſſe: but how? voluntarilie. Not a bone of him ſhall be brokē. What hinders it? lo, there he hangs, as it were neglected, &amp; at mercy; yet all the raging Iewes, no, all the deuils in hell, cannot ſtirre one bone in his bleſſed body: It was prophecied in the Eaſter-Lambe, and it muſt be fulfilled in him that is the true Paſſeouer, in ſpight of fiends and men. How then? hee muſt bee thruſt in the ſide: behold, not the very ſpeare could touch his precious ſide beeing dead, but it muſt be guided by a prophecie; They ſhall ſee him whom they haue thruſt-thorough,
                     
ſaith Zacharie. What ſhal he ſay the while? Not his very words but are foreſpoken: his complaint, Eli Eli lamma ſabactani, as the Chalde; or 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      as the Hebrew, Pſalme 22, 2. His reſignation; In manus tuas, Juto thy hands J commend my ſpirit; Pſalm 31, 5. His requeſt; Father, forgiue them: Hee prayed for the tranſgreſſours, ſaith Eſay. And now, when he ſaw all theſe prophecies were fulfilled; knowing that one remained, hee ſaid, J thirst. Domine, quid ſatis? faith one; O LORD, vvhat thirſteſt thou for? A ſtrange hearing; that a man, yea, that GOD and MAN, dying, ſhould complaine of thirſt.
                  
                     Could hee indure the ſcorching flames of the wrath of his Father, the curſe of our ſinnes, thoſe tortures of body, thoſe horrours of ſoule; and doth he ſhrinke at his thirſt? No, no: he could haue borne his drought; hee could not beare the Scripture not fulfilled. It was not neceſſity of Nature, but the neceſſity of his Fathers decree, that drew foorth this word, I thirſt. They offered it before: hee refuſed it. Whether it were an ordinary potion for the cō
                     demned, to haſten death (as in the ſtory of M. Antony) which is the moſt receiued conſtruction: or whether it were that Iewiſh potion, wherof the Rabbines

ſpeake; whoſe tradition was, that the malefactor to be executed, ſhould after ſome good counſell frō two of their Teachers, be taught to ſay;Sit mors mea in remiſſionem omnium iniquitatum mearum. 
                     Let my death be to the remiſsion of all my ſinnes; and then, that hee ſhould haue giuen him a boule of mixt wine,Vt vſ

                  I durſt bee confident in this later; the rather, for that Saint Marke calls this draught 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     : Myrrhe-wine; mingled (as is like) with other ingredients. And Montanus agrees with me in the end, ad ſtuporem &amp; mentis alienationem

out of the Sanhedrim, to bee grounded vpon Prouerbs 31, 6. Giue ſtrong drinke to him that is readie to periſh. I leaue it modeſtly in the midſt; let the learneder iudge. What-ſoeuer it were, hee would not die till he had complained of thirſt, and in his thirſt taſted it: Neither wold he haue thirſted for, or taſted any but this bitter draught; that the Scripture might bee fulfilled; They gaue mee Vineger to drinke: And loe, novv, Conſummatum est; All is finiſhed.
                  
                  If there be any Iew amongſt you, that like one of Iohns vnſeaſonable Diſciples, ſhal aske, Art thou he, or ſhall we looke for

another? hee hath his anſwere; Yee men of Iſraell, why ſtand you gazing and gaping for another Meſſias? In this alone, all the prophecies are finiſhed; &amp; of him alone, all was prophecied that was finiſhed. Paul's old rule holds ſtill, To the Jewes a ſtumbling blocke; and that more anciēt curſe of Dauid, Let their table be made a ſnare; And Steuens two brands ſticke ſtill in the fleſhe of theſe vvretched men: One in their neck;

and ſeruilitie: vncircumciſed harts, the filme of whoſe vnbeliefe, would not be cut off with ſo infinite cōuictions. Oh mad &amp; miſerable Nation! Let them ſhew vs one prophecie that is not fulfilled; let thē ſhew vs one other, in whom all the prophecies can be fulfilled, &amp; we wil mix pitty with our hate: If they cannot, and yet reſiſt; their doome is paſt; Thoſe mine enemies, that would not haue me to raigne ouer them, bring them hither, and ſlay them before mee. So let thine enemies periſh, O Lord.
                  But what goe I ſo farre? euen amongſt vs (to our ſhame) this riotous age hath bred a monſtrous

generation;Aug. ad Hier Dū volunt &amp; Iudaei eſſe &amp; Chriſtiani, nec Iudaei ſunt, ne
                           •
                         Chriſtiani. (I pray God I bee not now in ſome of your boſomes that heare mee this day) compounded, much like to the Turkiſh religion; of one part, Chriſtian; another, Iew; a third, worldling; a fourth, Atheiſt: a Chriſtian face, a Iewes hart, a worldlings life, &amp; therefore Atheous in the whole; that acknowledge a God, &amp; knowe him not; that profeſſe a Chriſt, but doubt of him; yea, belieue him not: The foole hath ſaid in his hart there is no Chriſt. What ſhall I ſay of the ſemen? they are worſe then deuils▪ that yielding euill ſpirit, could ſay, Ieſus I know; and theſe miſcreants are ſtil in the old tune of that tempting

deuill; Si tu es filius Dei, if thou be the Christ. Oh God, that after ſo cleer a Goſpell, ſo many miraculous confirmations, ſo many thouſand martyrdōs, ſo many glorious victories of truth, ſo many open confeſſions of Angels, men, diuells, friends; enemies; ſuch conſpirations of heauen &amp; earth, ſuch vniuerſall conteſtations of all ages and people; there ſhould be left any ſparke of this damnable infidelitie in the falſe harts of men! Behold then, yee deſpiſers, and wonder, and vaniſh away: whom haue all the Prophets fore-told? or vvhat haue the prophecies of ſo many hundreds, yea, thouſands of

yeers fore-ſaid, that is not with this word finiſhed? Who could fore-tell theſe things, but the ſpirit of God? Who could accompliſh them, but the ſonne of God? Hee ſpake by the mouth of his holy Prophets, ſaith Zacharie: he hath ſpoken, &amp; hee hath done; one true GOD in both. No other ſpirit could fore-ſay theſe things ſhould bee done; none other power could doe theſe things, thus fore-ſhewed: this word therfore, can fit none but the mouth of God our Sauiour, It is finiſhed. Wee knowe whom we haue belieued; Thou art the Chriſt, the ſonne of the liuing GOD. Let him that loues not the Lord Ieſus, be accurſed

to the death.
                  Thus the prophecies are finiſhed: Of the legall Obſeruations, with more breuity▪ 
                     Christ is the end of the law: What law? Ceremoniall; Morall. Of the morall; it was kept perfectly by himſelfe, ſatisfied fully for vs: of the ceremoniall; it was referred to him, obſerued of him, fulfilled in him, aboliſht by him. There were nothing more eaſie then to ſhew you how all thoſe Iewiſh ceremonies lookt at Chriſt: how Circumciſion, Paſſouer, the Tabernacle, both outer and inner, the Temple, the Lauer,
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . both the Altars, the Tables of Shew-breade, the candleſticks, the Vaile, the Holy

of holies, the Arke, the Propitiatory, the pot of Manna, Aarons rodde, the high Prieſt, his order and line, his habites, his inaugurations, his waſhings, annointings, ſprinklings, offerings, the ſacrifices 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , and what euer Iewiſh rite; had their vertue from Chriſt, relation to him, and their end in him. This was then their laſt gaſpe; for, now ſtraight they died with Chriſt: now the vaile of the Temple rent:Ex quo apparet, tunc ſciſsū eſſe cùm Chriſtus emiſit ſpiritum. As Auſten well notes, out of Mathew's order; It tore then, when Chriſts laſt breath paſſed. That conceit of Theophylact is witty; that as the Iewes were wont to rend their garments whē they heard

blaſphemy: ſo the Temple, not induring theſe execrable blaſphemies againſt the Sonne of God, tore his vaile in peeces. But that is not all: the vaile rent, is the obligation of the rituall lawe cancelled; the way into the heauenly Sanctuarie opened; the ſhadow giuing roome to the ſubſtance: in a word, it dooth that which Chriſt ſaith; Conſummatū eſt. Euen now then the law of ceremonies died:Ceremoniae ſicut defuncta corpora a neceſſariorū officijs deducenda erant ad ſepulturā, non ſimulatè, ſed religiosè, nec deſerenda continuò. Auguſtin. It had a long and ſolemne buriall, as Auguſtine ſaith wel; perhaps figured in Moſes, who died not lingringly, but was thirty daies mourned for. What meanes the Church of Rome, to dig them vp, now rotten in their graues?

and that, not as if they had been buried, but ſowen, with a plentifull increaſe: yea, vvith the inuerted vſury of too many of you Cittizens; ten for one. It is a graue and deepe cenſure of that reſolute Hierome; Ego è contrario loquar, &amp;c. J ſay,
                     Ego è cōtrario loquar, &amp; reclamāte mūdo liberâ voce pro nūciē, ceremonias Iudaeorū pernicioſas eſſe, et mortiferas, &amp; quicunque eas obſeruauerit ſiue ex Iudaeis, ſiue ex Gētibus, in barathrū diaboli deuolutū. Hier. ſaith he, and in ſpight of all the vvorld dare maintain, that now the Iewiſh ceremonies are pernicious, and deadly: &amp; whoſoeuer ſhal obſerue them, whether he be Jew or Gentile, in barathrū diaboli deuolutum; ſhall fry in hell for it. Still Altars? ſtill Prieſts? ſacrifices ſtill? ſtill waſhings? ſtill vnctions? ſprinkling, ſhauing, purifying? ſtill all, and more then all? Let them heare but Auguſtines

cenſure;Quiſquis nunc ea celebrare voluerit, tanquā ſopitos cineres eruens, nō erit pius &amp;c. 
                     Quiſquis nunc, &amp;c. Whoſoeuer ſhall now vſe thē, as it were raking them vp out of their duſt; he ſhall not be pius deductor corporis, ſed impius ſepulturae violator: an impious &amp; ſacrilegious wretch, that ranſacks the quiet tombes of the dead.
                  
                  I ſay not that all ceremonies are dead; but the Law of ceremonies, and of Iewiſh. It is a ſound diſtinction of them, that profound Peter Martyr hath in his Epiſtle, to that worthy Martyr, Father, Biſhoppe, Hooper: Some are typicall, fore-ſignifying Chriſt to come: ſome, of order and decencie. Thoſe are abrogated, not theſe. The Iewes had a faſhion of prophecying

in the Churches; ſo the Chriſtians from them, as Ambroſe: the Iewes had an eminent pulpit of wood; ſo wee: they gaue names at their circumciſion; ſo we at Baptiſme: they ſung pſalmes melodiouſly in Churches; ſo do we: they paid &amp; receiued tithes; ſo do we: they wrapt their dead in linnen, with odors; ſo wee: the Iewes had ſureties at their admiſsiō into the church; ſo we. Theſe inſtances might be infinite, the Spouſe of Chriſt cannot be without her laces, &amp; chaines, and borders. Chriſt came not to diſſolue order. But thou Lorde, how long? how long ſhall thy poore Church find her ornamēts, her ſorowes?

and ſee the deare ſonnes of her wombe, bleeding about theſe apples of ſtrife? let me ſo name them, not for their value (euen ſmal things, whē they are commaunded, looke for no ſmal reſpect) but for their euent: the enemy is at the gates of our Syracuſe; how long will we ſuffer our ſelues, taken vp with angles and circles in the duſt▪ Yemen, brethren, fathers, helpe; for Gods ſake put to your hands, to the quenching of this common flame: The one ſide by humilitie, and obedience; the other, by compaſſion; both by prayers and teares. Who am I, that I ſhould reuiue to you the ſweet ſpirit of that diuine Auguſtine?

who, when hee heard &amp; ſaw the bitter contentions betwixt two graue and famous Diuines, Ierome, and Ruffine; Heu mihi, ſaith he, qui vos alicubi ſimul inuenire non poſſum! Alas, that J ſhall neuer find you two together! how J would fall at your feet, how J would imbrace them, and weepe vpon them, and beſeech you; either of you for other, and each for himſelf; both of you for the church of GOD; but eſpecially, for the weake, for whō Chriſt died: who, not without their own great danger, ſee you two fighting in this Theater of the world. Yet let me doe, what he ſaid he would do; begge for peace, as for life: by your filiall pietie to the Church

of GOD, whoſe ruines follow vpon our diuiſions; by your loue of Gods truth; by the graces of that one bleſſed Spirit, whereby we are all informed &amp; quickened▪ by the precious blood of that ſonne of GOD, which this day, and this howre, was ſhed for our redemption, be inclined to peace and loue: &amp; tho our braines be different, yet let our harts be one. It was, as I heard, the dying ſpeech of our late reuerend, worthy, and gracious Dioceſan, Modò me moriēte viuat ac floreat Eccleſia; Oh! yet if, when J am dead, the Church may liue and flouriſh.
                  
                  What a ſpirit was heere? what a ſpeech? how worthy neuer to

die? how worthy of a ſoule ſo neere to his heauen? how worthy of ſo happy a ſucceſſion? Ye whom God hath made inheritors of this bleſſed care, which do no leſſe long for the proſperitie of Sion, liue you to effect, what he did but liue to wiſh▪ all peace with our ſelues, and war with none but Rome and Hell. And if there bee any weyward Separatiſt, whoſe ſoule profeſſeth to hate peace; I feare to tell him Paules meſſage, yet I muſt: Would to God thoſe were out off that trouble you. How cut off? As good Theodoſius ſaid to Demophilus, a contentious Prelate; Situ pacem fugis, &amp;c.
                     Si tu pacē fugis, ego te ab Eccleſia fuger
                           •
                        mando. 
                     of thou flie peace, I wil make thee flie

the Church. Alas! they doe flie it: that which ſhould bee their puniſhment, they make their cōtentment: how are they worthy of pitty? As Optatus, of his Donatiſts, they are brethren, might be companions, and will not. Oh wilfull men! vvhither doe they run? from one Chriſt to another? Is Chriſt diuided? We haue him; thanks be to our good God: and wee heare him daily; and whither ſhall we goe from thee? thou haſt the words of eternall life.
                  Thus the Ceremonies are finiſhed: Now heare the end of his ſufferings, vvith like patience and deuotion. His death is heere included; it was ſo

neere, that hee ſpake of it as done; and when it was done, all was done. How eaſie is it to loſe our ſelues in this diſcourſe▪ how hard, not to be ouer-whelmed vvith matter of wonder; and to find either beginning, or end! His ſufferings found an end; our thoughts cannot. Lo; with this word, he is happilie waded out of thoſe deepes of ſorowes, wherof our conceits can find no bottome: yet let vs, with Peter, gird our coa
                        •
                     e, and caſt our ſelues a little into this ſea.
                  All his life was but a perpetuall Paſſion: In that he becam man, he ſuffered more then we can doe, either while wee are

men, or when wee ceaſe to be men:
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . he humbled, yea, he emptied himſelfe. Wee, when vvee ceaſe to be heere, are clothed vpon. 2. Cor. 5▪ Wee both win by our beeing, &amp; gaine by our leſſe; hee loſt, by taking our more or leſſe to himſelfe, that is, manhood. For, tho euer as God, I and my Father are one; yet as man, My Father is greater then J. That man ſhould be turned into a beaſt, into a worme, into duſt, into nothing; is not ſo great a diſparagemēt, as that GOD ſhould become man▪ and yet it is not finiſhed; it is but begun. But what man? If, as the abſolute Monarch of the world, he had commanded

the vaſſalage of all Emperours and Princes, &amp; had trod on nothing but Crownes and Scepters, and the necks of Kings, and bidden all the Potentates of the earth to attend his train; this had caried ſome port with it, ſutable to the heroicall maieſtie of Gods Sonne. No ſuch matter: heere is neither forme nor beautie; vnleſſe perhaps (
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

Looke back to his cradle; there you find him reiected of the Bethlemites; borne &amp; laid alas how homely, how vnworthily: ſought for by Herod, exiled to Egypt, obſcurely brought vp in the cottage of a poore foſterfather, tranſported &amp; tempted by Satan, derided of his kindred, blaſphemouſly traduced by the Iewes, pinched with hunger, reſtleſſe, harbourleſſe, ſorrowfull, perſecuted, by the Elders

and Phariſees, ſold by his owne ſeruant, apprehended, arraigned, ſcourged, condemned; &amp; yet it is not finiſhed. Let vs, with that Diſciple, follow him a farre off; &amp; paſſing ouer all his contemptuous vſage in the way, ſee him brought to his Croſſe. Still the further wee looke, the more wonder; euery thing ads to this ignominy of ſuffering, and triumph of ouercomming. Where was it? not in a corner,

ſhame him: In Ieruſalem, which hee had honoured with his preſence, taught with his preachings, aſtoniſht with his miracles, bewailed with his teares; O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, how oft would J, and thou wouldeſt not! O yet if in this thy daie! Crueltie and vnkindneſſe, after good deſert, afflict ſo much more, as our merit hath beene greater. VVhere-abouts? vvithout the gates: in Caluary; among the ſtinking bones of execrable malefactors. Before, the glory of the place bred ſhame; novv, the vileneſs of it. When? but in the Paſſeouer; a time of greateſt frequence, and concourſe of all Iewes and proſelites: An

al deathes are not equally fearfull: there is not more differēce betwixt ſome life &amp; death, then betwixt one death &amp; another. See the Apoſtles gradation: He was made obedient to the death, euē the death of the Croſſe. The Croſſe, a lingering, tormenting, ignominious death. The Iewes had foure kindes of death for malefactors; the towell, the ſword, fire, ſtones; each of theſe aboue other in extreamitie. Strangling with the towell, they accounted eaſieſt: the ſword worſe then the towel: the fire worſe then the ſword: ſtoning worſe then the fire: but this Romaine death was worſt of all. Curſed is euery one that

hangeth on tree. Yet (as Ierome well) he is not therefore accurſed, becauſe hee hangeth; but therfore he hangeth, becauſe he is accurſed. He was made (

                        ) a curſe for vs. The curſe was more then the ſhame: yet the ſhame is vnſpeakeable; and yet not more then the paine. Yet all that die the ſame death, are not equally miſerable: the very Thieues fared better in their death, then he. I heare of no irriſion, no inſcription, no taunts, no inſultation on thē: they had nothing but paine to incounter; hee, paine and ſcorne. An ingenuous &amp; noble nature, can worſe brooke this thē the other; any thing rather then diſdainefulneſſe,

The Iews, the ſouldiours, yea, the very thieues flouted him, and triumpht ouer his miſerie: his blood cannot ſatisfie thē, without his reproach. Which of his ſenſes now was not a window to let in ſorrow? His eyes ſaw the teares of his Mother and friends, the vnthankful demeanure of mankind, the cruell deſpight of his enemies: his eares heard the reuilings &amp; blaſphemies of the multitude: &amp; (whether the place were noiſome to his ſent) his touch felt the nailes;

We may behold and

ſee; but all the glorious ſpirits in heauen cannot looke into the depth of this ſuffering. Do but looke yet a little into the paſſions of this his Paſſion: for, by the manner of his ſufferings, we ſhall beſt ſee what hee ſuffered. Wiſe and reſolute men, do not complaine of a little: holy Martyrs haue bin racked, &amp; would not be looſed; what ſhall we ſay if the Author of their ſtrength, God and man, be wray paſſions? what wold haue ouerwhelmed men, wold not haue made him ſhrinke; and what made him complaine, could neuer haue been ſuſtained by men. What ſhal we then think, if he were affrighted with terrors, perplexed

with ſorrowes, and diſtracted with both theſe? And lo, he was all theſe: for, firſt, heere was an amazed feare; for millions of men to deſpaire, was not ſo much as for him to feare: and yet it was no ſlight feare; hee began

Neuer man was ſo afraid of the torments of hell, as Chriſt (ſtanding in our roome) of his Fathers vvrath. Feare is ſtill ſutable to apprehenſion: Neuer man could ſo perfectlie apprehende this

cauſe of feare. He felt the chaſtiſements of our peace: yea, the curſe of our ſinnes; &amp; therfore might well ſay with Dauid; J ſuffer thy terrors with a troubled mind: yea, with Iob, The arrowes of God are in me; &amp; the terrors of God fight againſt mee. With feare; there was a deiecting ſorow

                        . his many tears, are witneſſes of this Paſſion. He had formerly ſhed teares of pitie, and teares of loue; but now of anguiſh: he had before ſent forth cries of mercie; neuer of complaint till now. When the ſonne of God weeps and cries, what ſhall we ſay or thinke? yet

further, betwixt both theſe and his loue, what a conflict vvas there? It is not amiſſe diſtinguiſhed, that hee was alwaies in agonie; but now in 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , in a ſtruggling paſſion of mixed griefe. Behold: this field was not without ſweat and blood; yea, a ſweat of blood▪ O what man or Angell, can conceiue the taking of that heart, that without all outward violence, meerely, out of the extreamity of his owne Paſſion, bled (thorough the fleſh and skinne) not ſom faint deaw, but ſolid drops of blood? No thornes, no nailes fetcht blood from him, with ſo much pain as his own thoughts. Hee ſaw the fierce wrath of his

Father, and therfore feared▪ he ſawe the heauie burden of our ſinnes to bee vndertaken; and therevpon, beſides feare, iuſtlie grieued: he ſaw the neceſſity of our eternall damnation, if hee ſuffered not; if he did ſuffer, of our redemption: and therfore his loue incountred both griefe and feare. In it ſelfe, he would not drinke of that cuppe: in reſpect of our good, and his decree, hee would and did; and while he thus ſtriueth, he ſweats and bleedes. There was neuer ſuch a combatte, neuer ſuch a bloodſhed; and yet it is not finiſhed. I dare not ſay with ſome Schoolemen▪ that the ſorrow of his Paſſion, was not ſo great

as the ſorow of his compaſſion: yet that vvas ſurely exceeding great. To ſee the vngracious careleſneſſe of mankind, the ſlender fruite of his ſufferings, the ſorrowes of his mother, diſciples, friends; to fore-ſee frō this watch-towre of his Croſſe, the future temptations of his children, deſolations of his Church; all theſe muſt needs ſtrike deepe into a tender hart. Theſe he ſtill ſees &amp; pitties, but without paſsion; then, he ſuffered, in ſeeing them.
                  Can wee yet ſay any more? Lo, all theſe ſufferings are aggrauated by his fulnes of knowledge, &amp; want of comfort: for, he did not ſhut his eyes, as one

ſaith, when hee drunk this cup he ſaw how dreggiſh, and knew how bitter it was. Sodaine euils afflict, if not leſſe, ſhorter. He fore-ſaw and fore-ſaid euerie particular he ſhould ſuffer, ſo long as he fore-ſaw he ſuffered: the expectation of euill, is not leſſe then the ſenſe▪ to looke long for good, is a puniſhment; but for euill, is a torment. No paſſion works vpō an vnknown obiect: as no loue, ſo no fear is of what we know not▪ Hence men fear not hell, becauſe they fore-ſee it not: if we could ſee that pit open before wee come at it, it would make vs tremble at our ſinnes, and our knees to knock together, as Baltaſars; &amp;

perhaps, without faith, to run mad at the horror of iudgemēt. He ſaw the burdē of all particular ſins to be laid vpon him: euery dram of his fathers wrath, was meaſured out to him, ere he touch
                        •
                      this potion: this cup was full; &amp; he knew that it muſt be wringd, not a drop left: it muſt be finiſhed. O yet, if as he fore-ſaw all his ſorrowes, ſo he could haue ſeene ſome mixture of refreſhing! But J found none to comfort me; no, none to pitie me. And yet, it is a poore cō
                     fort that ariſes from pittie. Euen ſo, O Lord, thou treadeſt this wine-preſſe alone; none to accompany, none to aſſiſt thee. I remember, Ruffinus in his Eccleſiaſticall

ſtorie reports, that one Theodorus, a Martyr, told him, that when he was hanging ten houres vpō the rack, for religion, vnder Iulians perſecution, his ioynts diſtended and diſtorted, his body exquiſitelie tortured vvith change of executioners; ſo as neuer age, ſaith he,Vt nulla vnquam aetas ſimilem memi

                        erit. could remember the like: he felt no paine at all, but continued indeed all the while in the ſight of all men, ſinging &amp; ſmiling. For, there ſtood a comlie young man by him on his Iibbet (an Angell rather, in forme of a man) which with a cleane towel, ſtill wip't off his ſweat, &amp; poured coole vvater vpon his racked limbs: wherwith he was

ſo refreſhed, that it grieued him to be let downe. Euen the greateſt torments are eaſie, whē they

If yet but the ſame meſſenger of GOD, might haue attended his Croſs, that appeared in his agonie; &amp; might haue giuen eaſe to their Lord, as he did to his ſeruant! And yet, what can the Angels help, where God will ſmite? Againſt the violence of men, againſt the furie of Satan, they haue preuailed in the Cauſe of GOD, for men: they dare not, they cannot cōfort where God will afflict. When our Sauiour had been wreſtling with Satan,

in the end of his Lent, then they appeared to him, and ſerued▪ but now, while about the ſame time, hee is wreſtling with the wrath of his Father for vs, not an Angell dare bee ſeene, to looke out of the windowes of heauē to relieue him: for men; much leſſe could they if they would; but what did they? Miſerable comforters are yee all; the ſouldiours; they ſtript him, ſcorned him with his purple, crown, reed; ſpat on him, ſmote him: the paſſengers; they reuiled him; and inſulting, wagg'd their heads and hands at him; Hey, thou that deſtroieſt the temple, come downe, &amp;c. The Elders and Scribes alas! they haue

bought his blood, ſuborned witneſſes, incenſed Pilate, preferred Barabbas, vndertook the guilt of his death, cri'd out, Crucifie, crucifie; Ho! thou that ſauedſt others. His diſciples; alas! they forſooke him: one of them forſweares him; another runs away naked, rather then he will ſtay and confeſſe him. His mother, and other friends: they looke on indeede, and ſorrovv with him; but, to his diſcomfort. Where the griefe is extreame, and reſpects neere, partnerſhip doth but increaſe ſorrovv. Paul chides this loue: What doe you weeping, and breaking my heart? The teares of thoſe we loue, do either ſlacken our hearts, or

wound them. Who then ſhall comfort him? Himſelfe? Somtimes our own thoughts find a way to ſuccour vs, vnknown to others: no, not himſelf.

breake him. Eſay, 53, 10. Yet any thing is light to the ſoule, whiles the comforts of God ſuſtaine it: who can diſmay, where God will relieue? But here, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee? VVhat a word was heere, to come from the mouth of the Sonne of GOD? My diſciples are men, weak &amp; fearefull; no maruell if they forſake me. The Iewes are themſelues, cruell and obſtinate. Men are men, graceleſſe, and vnthankfull. Diuels are, according to their nature, ſpightful and malicious. All theſe doe but their kind, and let them doe it: but thou, O Father, thou that haſt ſaid; This is my wel-beloued ſon,

in whom J am well pleaſed: thou of whō I haue ſaid, Jt is my Father that glorifies me: what? forſaken mee? Not onely brought me to this ſhame, ſmitten mee, vnregarded me; but, as it were, forgotten, yea, forſaken mee? What, euen mee, my Father? How many of thy conſtant ſeruaunts haue ſuffered heauie things! yet in the multitudes of the ſorrowes of their harts, thy preſence and comforts haue refreſhed their ſoule. Haſt thou relieued them, and dooſt thou forſake mee▪ mee, thine onelie, deere, naturall, eternall ſonne! O yee heauens &amp; earth, how could you ſtand, whiles the Maker of you thus cōplained!

I call you not to a weake &amp; idle pitty of our glorious Sauior: to what purpoſe? His iniury, was our glory. No, no; Ye daughters of Jeruſalem, weepe not for mee: but weepe for your ſelues: For our ſinnes, that haue done this; not for his ſorrow that ſuffered it: not for his pangs, that were; but for our owne that ſhould haue been, &amp;

(if we repent not) ſhall be. Oh how grieuous, how deadly are our ſinnes, that coſt the ſonne of God (beſides blood) ſo much tormēt? How far are our ſoules gone, that could not be ranſomed with any eaſier price? That that tooke ſo much of this infinite Redeemer of men, God &amp; man, how can it chuſe but ſwallow vp &amp; confound thy ſoule, which is but finite and ſinfull? If thy ſoule had been in his ſoules ſtead, what had become of it: it ſhal be, if his were not in ſtead of thine. This weight, that lies thus heauy on the Son of God, &amp; wrung from him theſe teares, ſweat, blood, and theſe vnconceiueable grones of his afflicted

ſpirit, how ſhall it chuſe but preſſe downe thy ſoule to the bottom of hell? &amp; ſo it will do: if hee haue not ſuffered it for thee, thou muſt and ſhalt ſuffer it for thy ſelfe. Goe now thou leud man, and make thy ſelfe merry with thy ſinnes; laugh at the vncleaneneſſes, or bloodineſſe of thy youth: thou little knoweſt the price of a ſin: thy ſoule ſhall do; thy Sauiour did, whē he cried out, to the amazement of Angels, and horror of men; My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee. But now no more of this; It is finiſhed: the greater conflict, the more happy victory. Well doth hee find and feele of his Father, what his

type ſaid before, Hee will not chide alwaies, nor keepe his anger for euer. It is fearefull; but in him, ſhort: eternall to ſinners; ſhort to his Sonne, in whom the God-head dwelt bodily. Behold: this ſtorme, where-with al the powers of the world were ſhaken, is now ouer. The Elders, Phariſees, Iudas, the ſouldiers, prieſts, witneſſes, Iudges, thieues, executioners, diuells, haue al tired thēſelues in vaine, with their owne malice; and he triumphs ouer them all, vpon this throne of his Croſſe: His enemies are vanquiſht, his Father ſatisfied, his ſoule with this word, at reſt and glory; Jt is finiſhed. Now there is no more

betraying, agonies, arraignmēts, ſcourgings, ſcoffing, crucifying, conflicts, terrors, all is finiſhed. Alas beloued, and will we not yet let the Son of God be at reſt? doe wee now againe goe about to fetch him out of his glorie, to ſcorne and crucifie him? I feare to ſay it: Gods ſpirit dare, and doth; They crucifie againe to themſelues the Son of God, and make a mock of him. To themſelues; not in himſelf: that they cannot, it is no thanke to them; they would doe it. See and conſider: the notoriouſly-ſinfull conuerſations of thoſe that ſhould be Chriſtians, offer violence vnto our glorified Sauiour: they ſtretch their hands

to heauen, and pull him downe from his Throne, to his Croſſe: they teare him vvith thornes, pearce him with nailes, loade him with reproaches. Thou hateſt the Iewes, ſpetteſt at the name of Iudas, raileſt on Pilate, condemneſt the cruel butchers of Chriſt: yet, thou canſt blaſpheme, &amp; ſweare him quite ouer; curſe, ſwagger, lie, oppreſſe, boile with luſt, ſcoffe, riot, and liueſt like a debauched man; yea, like an humane beaſt; yea, like an vncleane diuel. Cry Hoſanna as long as thou vvilt; thou art a Pilate, a Iew, a Iudas, an executioner of the Lord of life: and ſo much greater ſhall thy iudgemēt be, by how much

thy light, &amp; his glory, is more. Oh, beloued, is it not enough that he died once for vs? Were thoſe paines ſo light, that vve ſhould euery day redouble thē? Is this the entertainement, that ſo gracious a Sauiour hath deſerued of vs by dying? Is this the recompence of that infinite loue of his, that thou ſhouldeſt thus cruelly vexe and vvound him with thy ſinnes? Euerie of our ſins is a thorne, and naile, and ſpeare to him. While thou poureſt down thy drunken carowſes, thou giueſt thy Sauiour a potion of gall: while thou deſpiſeſt his poore ſeruants, thou ſpett'ſt in his face: while thou putteſt on thy proud dreſſes, &amp;

lifteſt vp thy vaine heart vvith high conceits, thou ſetteſt a Crowne of thornes on his head: while thou wringeſt and oppreſſeſt his poore children, thou whippeſt him, &amp; draweſt blood of his hands and feet. Thou hypocrite, how dareſt thou offer to receiue the Sacrament of God, with that hand, which is thus imbrued with the bloud of him whō thou receiueſt? In euery Ordinary, thy profane tong walkes, in the diſgrace of the religious &amp; cōſcionable. Thou makeſt no ſcruple of thine own ſinnes, and ſcorneſt thoſe that doe: Not to be wicked, is crime enough. Heare him that ſaith, Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou

mee? Saul ſtrikes, at Damaſcus: Chriſt ſuffers in heauen. Thou ſtrikeſt: Chriſt Ieſus ſmarteth, &amp; will reuenge. Theſe are the (

What ſhould we do but ſtriue and ſuffer, as our Generall hath done, that wee may raigne as he doth, and once triumph in our Conſummatū est? God &amp; his Angels ſit vpon the Scaffolds of Heauen, &amp; behold vs: our Crowne is ready; our day of deliuerance ſhall come; yea, our redemption is neere▪ vvhen all teares ſhall bee wip't from our eyes; &amp; wee that haue ſowen in teares, ſhall reape in ioy. In the meane time, let vs poſſeſſe our ſoules, not in patience onely, but in comfort: let vs adore and magnifie our Sauiour

in his ſufferings, and imitate him in our owne▪ our ſorrowes ſhall haue an end; our ioyes ſhall not: our paines ſhall ſoone be finiſhed; our glory ſhal be finiſhed, but neuer ended.
                  Thus his ſufferings are finiſhed; now together with them, Mans ſaluation. Who knowes not, that man had made himſelf a deepe debter, a bankrupt, an out-law to GOD? Our ſins are our debts; and by ſins, death. Now, in this word and act, our ſinnes are diſcharged, death indured, and therefore wee cleared. The debt is paid, the ſcore is croſſed, the Creditor ſatisfied, the Debters acquitted; and, ſince there was no other quarrell,

ſaued. We are all ſick, and that mortally: Sin is the diſeaſe of the ſoule. Quot vitia, tot febres, faith Chryſoſtome; ſo many ſinnes, ſo many Feauers, &amp; thoſe peſtilent. What wonder is it that we haue ſo much plague, while we haue ſo much ſin? Our Sauiour is the Phyſician; The vvhole neede not the Phyſician, but the ſicke. Wherein? He healeth all our infirmities: hee healeth thē after a miraculous maner; not by giuing vs receits, but by taking our receits for vs. A wonderfull Phyſician; a wonderful courſe of cure. One while he would cure vs by abſtinence; our ſuperfluity, by his forty daies emptineſſe: according

to that old rule▪ Hunger cures the diſeaſes of Gluttony. Another while, by exerciſe: He went vp and downe from Citty to Cittie; and in the day was preaching in the Temple; in the night, praying in the Mount. Then, by diet; Take, eate, this is my body: and, Let this cup paſſe. After that yet, by ſweat: ſuch a ſweat as neuer was a bloudy one: yet more by inciſion; they pearced his hands, feet, ſide: and yet againe by potion; a bitter potion, of vineger and gall. And laſtly, which is both the ſtrangeſt and ſtrongeſt receit of all, by dying; Which died for vs; that whether we wake or ſleep, we ſhould liue together with him.
                     1. Theſ. 5.10. We

need no more, wee can goe no further; there can bee no more phyſick of this kind: there are cordialls after theſe, of his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion; no more penall receits. By this bloud wee haue Redemption, Epheſ. 1, 7. Iuſtification, Rom. 3, 24. Reconciliation, Coloſ. 1, 20. Sanctification, 1. Pet. 1, 2. Entrance into glory, Hebr. 10, 19. Is it not now finiſhed
                        •
                      Wo were vs, if he had left but one mite of ſatisfaction vpon our ſcore, to bee diſcharged by our ſoules: and wo bee to them that derogate from Chriſt, that they may charge themſelues; that botch vp theſe alſufficiently meritorious ſufferings of Chriſt, as imperfect,

with the ſuperfluities of fleſh and bloud. Maledictus homo, qui ſpem ponit in homine▪
                      We may not with patiēce ſee Chriſt wrongd by his falſe friends: As that heroicall Luther ſaid in the like▪
                     Maledictū ſilentium, quod hîc conniuet. 
                     Curſed bee the ſilence that heer forbeareth to be free &amp; ſhort. Heere be two iniuries intolerable; both giue Chriſt the lye vpon his Croſſe: Jt is finiſhed. No; ſomewhat remaines: the fault is diſcharged, not the puniſhment. Of puniſhments, the eternall is quit, not the temporall▪ 
                     It is finiſhed by Chriſt: No, there wants yet much; the ſatisfactions of Saints applied by his Vicar: adde mens ſufferings to Chriſts, thē the treaſure is ful;

till then it is not finiſhed.
                  
                  Two qualities ſtriue for the firſt place in theſe two opinions; Impietie, and Abſurditie: I know not whether to prefer. For Impietie; heere is GOD taxed of iniuſtice, vnmercifulneſſe, inſufficiencie, falshood. Of iniuſtice; that he forgiues a ſin, and yet puniſhes for that which he hath forgiuen: vnmercifulneſſe; that he forgiues not while hee forgiues, but doth it by halues: inſufficiencie; that his raunſome muſt be ſupplied by men: falshood; in that hee ſaith, Jt is finiſhed, when it is not. For Abſurdity; how groſſe &amp; monſtrous are theſe Poſitions? that at once the ſame ſin ſhould bee

remitted &amp; retained; that there ſhould be a puniſhment, where there is no fault; that vvhat could ſtrike off our eternall puniſhment, did not wipe off the temporall; that hee which paid our pounds, ſticks at our far things; that GOD will retaine what man may diſcharge; that it is, and is not finiſhed.
                  If there bee anie opinions whoſe mention confutes them, theſe are they. None can bee more vaine; none had more neede of ſoliditie: for, this proppe beares-vp alone, the vveight of all thoſe millions of Indulgences which Rome creates and ſells to the vvorld. That Strumpet would well-neere

goe naked, if this vvere not. Theſe ſpirituall treaſures, fetch in the temporall: vvhich yet our reuerend and learned Fulke, iuſtlie calls a moſt blaſphemous and beggerly principle: it brings in vvhole Cheſts, yea Mines of Golde (like the Popes Indies); and hath not ſo much as a ragge of proofe to couer it; whether of Antiquitie, of Reaſon, of Scripture. Not of Antiquitie; for, theſe Iubilie Proclamations beganne but about three hundred yeers agoe. Not of Reaſon: hovv ſhould one meere man pay for another, diſpēſe with another, to another, by another? Not of Scripture: which hath flatly ſaid;

                     The bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, his ſon, purgeth vs from all ſin: and yet I remember, that acute Sadeel hath taught mee, that this practice is according to Scripture: What Scripture? He caſt the money-changers out of the Temple, and ſaid;

Some modeſt Doctors of Louan, wold faine haue minced this Antichriſtian blaſphemie: who began to teach, that the paſſions of the Saints are not ſo by Indulgences applied, that they become true ſatisfactions; but that they onely ſerue to moue God, by the ſight of

them, to apply vnto vs Chriſts ſatisfaction. But theſe meal-mouthed Diuines, were ſoone charmed; foure ſeuerall Popes (as their Cardinall confeſſeth) fell vpon the neck of them,Bellar. l. 1. d

of Saints, our ſinnes are expiate; and that, by them applied, wee are redeemed from thoſe puniſhments which we yet owe to GOD. Blaſphemy, vvorthie the tearing of garments: how is it finiſhed by Chriſt, if men muſt ſupply? Oh bleſſed Sauiour! was euery droppe of thy bloud enough to redeeme a world, and doe we yet need the help of men? How art thou a perfect Sauiour, if our brethren alſo muſt bee our redeemers? Oh ye bleſſed Saints, how wold you abhorre this ſacrilegious glory! and with thoſe holie Apoſtles, yea, that glorious Angell, ſay; Vide ne ſeceris; and with thoſe wiſe Virgins; Least

                  When I looke back to the firſt Chriſtians, and compare their zealous cōtempt of death, with our backwardneſs; I am at once amazed &amp; aſhamed: I ſee there euen women (the feebler ſex) running with their little ones in their armes, for the preferment of martyrdome; and ambitiouſlie ſtriuing for the next blowe. I ſee holy &amp; tender virgins, chuſing rather a ſore and ſhamefull death, then honourable eſpouſalls. I hear the bleſſed

Martyrs, intreating their Tyrants and tormentors for the honour of dying:Quod ſi venire noluerint, ego vim faciam vt deuorer. Ignatius, amongſt the reſt, fearing leaſt the beaſts wil not deuoure him, and vowing the firſt violence to them, that he might be diſpatched. And, what leſſe courage was there, in our memorable &amp; glorious fore-fathers of the laſt, of this age? and doe vvee, their cold and feeble ofspring, looke pale at the face of a faire and naturall death; abhor the violent, tho for Chriſt? Alas! how haue we gathered ruſt with our long peace? Our vnwillingneſſe, is from inconſideration, from diſtruſt. Looke but vp to Chriſt Ieſus vpon his

Croſſe, and ſee him bowing his head, and breathing out his ſoule; and theſe feares ſhall vaniſh. He died, &amp; wouldeſt thou liue? He gaue vp the ghoſt, and wouldeſt thou keep it? Whom vvouldeſt thou follow, if not thy Redeemer▪ If thou die not, if not vvillingly, thou goeſt contrarie to him,Si per ſingulos dies pro eo moreremur qui nos dilexit, non ſic debitum exolueremus. Chryſoſt. and ſhalt neuer meet him. Tho thou ſhouldeſt euery day die a death for him, thou couldeſt neuer requite his one death: and dooſt thou ſticke at one? Euery word hath his force, both to him and thee. He died, which is Lord of Life, and cōmaunder of Death; thou art but a tenant of life, a ſubiect of death. And yet it

was not a dying, but a giuing vp; not of a vaniſhing and aery breath, but of a ſpirituall ſoule, which after ſeparation, hath an entire life in it ſelfe. He gaue vp the Ghost. Hee died, that hath both ouercome and ſanctified, and ſweetned death. What feareſt thou? he hath puld out the ſting and malignity of death

O Death, where is thy ſting? O Graue, where is thy victorie? Yet the Spirit of God ſaith not hee died, but gaue vp the Ghost. The very heathen

Poet ſaith; He durst not ſay that a good man dies. It is worth the noting (me thinks) that vvhen S. Luke would deſcribe to vs the death of Ananias and Sapphira,
                        Acts. 5.5. he ſaith (
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ) hee expired: but when S. Iohn vvould deſcribe Chriſts death, he ſaith (
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ) he gaue vp the Ghost. How gaue he it vp and whither? How? ſo as after a ſort he retained it: his ſoule parted from his body; his Godhead was neuer diſtracted, either frō ſoule or body. This vnion is not in nature; but in perſon. If the natures of Chriſt could be diuided each would haue his ſubſiſtence; ſo there ſhould bee more perſons. God forbid: one

of the natures therefore, may haue a ſeparation in it ſelfe; the ſoule from the body: one nature cannot bee ſeparate from other, or either nature from the perſon. If you cannot conceiue, wonder: the Sonne of GOD hath wedded vnto himſelfe our humanitie, without all poſſibilitie of diuorce; the body hangs on the Croſſe, the ſoule is yielded; the Godhead is euiternally vnited to them both; acknowledges, ſuſtaines them both. The ſoule in his agony feeles not the preſence of the Godhead▪ the body, vpon the Croſſe, feeles not the preſence of the ſoule. Yet, as the Fathers of Chalcedon ſay

truly (
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ) indiuiſibly, inſeparably is the Godhead, with both of theſe, ſtill and euer, one and the ſame perſon. The Paſſion of Chriſt (as Auguſtine) was the ſleep of his Diuinitie: ſo, I may ſay; The death of Chriſt, was the ſleep of his Humanitie. Jf hee ſleepe, hee ſhall doe well; ſaid that diſciple, of Lazarus. Death vvas too weake to diſſolue the eternall bonds of this heauenly coniunction. Let not vs Chriſtians goe too much by ſenſe; we may be firmely knit to God, &amp; not feele it. Thou canſt not hope to be ſo neer to thy God as Chriſt was, vnited perſonally:Quantūcūqute deieceris, humilior non eris Chriſt. Hieron. thou canſt not fear, that God ſhould

ſeeme more abſent from thee, then he did from his own Son; yet was hee ſtill one with both body &amp; ſoule, when they were diuided from thēſelues. When he was abſent to ſenſe, hee was preſent to faith▪ when abſent in viſion, yet in vnion one and the ſame: ſo will he be to thy ſoule when it is at worſt. Hee is thine, and thou art his: if thy hold ſeeme looſened, his is not▪ Whē temptations will not let thee ſee him, hee ſees thee, and poſſeſſes thee; onely belieue thou againſt ſenſe, aboue hope: and tho he kil thee, yet truſt in him. Whither gaue hee it vp? Himſelfe expreſſes; Father, into thy hands: and, This day thou ſhalt

be with mee in Paradiſe. It is iuſtice to reſtore whence wee receiue; Jnto thy hands. He knew where it ſhould be both ſafe &amp; happie: true; he might be bold (thou ſaiſt) as the Son with the Father. The ſeruants haue done ſo; Dauid before him, Steuen after him. And leaſt we ſhould not think it our common right, Father, ſaith hee, J vvill that thoſe thou haſt giuen mee, may be with me, euen where I am: hee willes it; therefore it muſt be. It is not preſumption, but faith to charge God with thy ſpirit, neither can there euer be any belieuing ſoule ſo meane, that he ſhould refuſe it: all the feare is in thy ſelf; how canſt thou truſt

thy iewell with a ſtranger? What ſuddaine familiaritie is this? God hath been with thee, and gone by thee; thou haſt not ſaluted him: and now in all the haſt thou bequeatheſt thy ſoule to him. On what acquaintance? How deſperate is this careleſneſſe▪
                  
                  If thou haue but a little money, whether thou keepe it, thou lay'ſt it vp in the Temple of Truſt; or whether thou let it; thou art ſure of good aſſurance, ſound bonds. If but a little land, how carefully dooſt thou make firme conueyances to thy deſired heires? If goods, thy wil hath taken ſecure order vvho ſhall enioy them; we need not teach

you Cittizens to make ſure worke for your eſtates▪ If children, thou diſpoſeſt of them in trades, with portions: onelie of thy ſoule (which is thy ſelfe) thou knoweſt not what ſhal become. The world muſt haue it no more; thy ſelf would'ſt keep it, but thou know'ſt thou canſt not: Satan would haue it; and thou know'ſt not whether hee ſhall: thou wouldeſt haue God haue it; and thou knoweſt not whether hee will: yea, thy hart is now ready with Pharaoh, to ſay; Who is the Lorde? O the fearefull and miſerable eſtate of that man, that muſt part with his ſoule, hee knowes not whither! Which, if thou wouldeſt

auoide (as this very vvarning ſhall iudge thee if thou do not) bee acquainted vvith GOD in thy life, that thou maiſt make him the Gardian of thy ſoule, in thy death. Giuen vp it muſt needs be; but to him that hath gouern'd it if thou haue giuen it to Satan in thy life; hovv canſt thou hope God will in thy death entertaine it? Did you not hate me, and expell mee out of my fathers houſe; how then come ye to me now in this time of your tribulation; ſaid Ieptha, to the men of Gilead. No, no: either giue vp thy ſoule to God while he calls for it in his word, in the prouocations of his loue, in his afflictions, in the holy motions

of his ſpirit to thine: or elſe whē thou wouldeſt giue it, hee vvill none of it, but as a Iudge, to deliuer it to the Tormentor.
                  What ſhould God do, with an vncleane, drunken, profane, proud, couetous ſoule? Without holineſſe, it is no ſeeing of GOD: Depart from me, yee wicked; J know yee not; goe to the Gods you haue ſerued. See how GOD is euen with men: they had in the time of the Goſpell, ſaid to the holy one of Iſraell; Depart from vs: now in the time of iudgement, he ſaith to them; Depart from me. They would not knowe God when they might; now God will not knowe them when they would.

Novv therefore (beloued) if thou would'ſt not haue GOD ſcorne the offer of thy death-bed, fit thy ſoule for him in thy health; furniſh it with grace; inure it to a ſweet conuerſation with the God of heauen: then maiſt thou boldly giue it vp; &amp; he ſhall as graciouſly receiue it, yea, fetch it by his Angels to his glory.
                  
                     Hee gaue vp the Ghoſt. Wee muſt doe as hee did; not all with the ſame ſucceſſe. Giuing vp, ſuppoſes a receiuing, a returning. This in-mate that vve haue in our boſome, is ſent to lodge heer for a time; may not dwell heere alwaies. The right of this tenure, is the Lords, not

ours. As hee ſaid of the hatchet; It is but lent, it muſt be reſtored: It is ours to keepe; his to diſpoſe and require. See and conſider both our priuiledge and charge; It is not with vs as vvith brute Creatures: vvee haue a liuing Ghoſt to informe vs, vvhich yet is not ours, (and, alas, what is ours, if our ſoules be not?) but muſt bee giuen vp; to him that gaue it.
                  VVhy doe wee liue, as thoſe that tooke no keepe of ſo glorious a gueſt? as thoſe that ſhould neuer part vvith it; as thoſe that thinke it giuen them to ſpend; not to returne with a reckoning?
                  
                     If thou hadſt no ſoule, if a mortall one, if thine owne, if neuer to bee required, hovv couldeſt thou liue but ſenſuallie? Oh remember but vvho thou art, what thou haſt, and whither thou muſt; and thou ſhalt liue like thy ſelfe vvhile thou art, and giue vp thy Ghoſt confidently vvhen thou ſhalt ceaſe to bee▪ Neither is there heere more certaintie of our departure then comfort. Carie this with thee to thy death-bed; and ſee if it can refreſh thee, when all the world cannot giue thee one dramme of comfort. Our ſpirit is our deereſt riches: if wee ſhould loſe it, here were iuſt cauſe of griefe. Howle and

lament, if thou thinkeſt thy ſoule periſheth: it is not forfeited, but ſurrendred. How ſafely doth our ſoule paſſe through the gates of death, without any impeachment, while it is in the hands of the Almightie? Woe were vs, if he did not keep it while we haue it; much more when we reſtore it. Wee giue it vp to the ſame hands that created, infuſed, redeemed, renewed, that doe protect, preſerue, eſtabliſh, and will crowne it: J knowe vvhom J haue belieued; and J am perſvvaded, that he is able to keepe that vvhich J haue committed to him againſt that day. O ſecure and happy eſtate of the godly! O bleſſed exchange

of our condition: while our ſoule dwells in our breaſt, how is it ſubiect to infinite miſeries? diſtempred vvith paſſions, charged with ſinnes, vexed with tentations; aboue, none of theſe: how ſhould it bee otherwiſe? This is our pilgrimage, that our home: this our wilderneſſe, that our land of promiſe: this our bondage, that our kingdom. Our impotency cauſeth this our ſorrow.
                  VVhen our ſoule is once giuen vppe, vvhat euill ſhall reach vnto heauen, and wreſtle with the Almightie? Our loathneſſe to giue vp, comes from our ignorance and infidelitie. No man goes vnwillinglie to a

certaine preferment; J defute to be diſſolued, ſaith Paule: J haue ſerued thee, J haue beleeued thee, and now: J come to thee, ſaith Luther: The voices of Saints, not of men. If thine heart can ſay thus, thou ſhalt not need to intreat with old Hilarion, Egredere me

thee againe, with that glorie and happineſſe vvhich can neuer bee conceiued, and ſhall neuer bee ended. Euen ſo, Lord IESVS, Come quicklie.
