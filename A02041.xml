            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            ¶ The, xxv, orders of Fooles,
            
               STay a while with paciēce, my fréends I you pray,
               Of the orders of Fooles, somewhat I wyll say:
               Fiue and twentie, iust a quarterne is ye know,
               Euery Foole in his foolishnes wyll I show.
               And as the prouerbe doth show very playne,
               A hood for this foole, to kepe him from the rayne.
            
            
               ¶ Many Fooles, the carte of sin now a dayes doth draw,
               Nowrishyng their sinne against all right and law:
               Though that the way to hell be very playne,
               Yet lyke a foole I aduise thée to returne agayne.
               If thou in foolishnes styll doest dwell,
               Thou shalt haue a bable and a bell.
            
            
               * He is a foole that his sinnes can not hate,
               Naught young, worse olde, such is his estate:
               This olde foole is glad of that name,
               Desiryng all men to take parte of the same.
               This foole must haue in hand without fayle,
               A bable, a bell, or els a Fox tayle.
            
            
               ¶ Of Fooles, yet I fynd an other sorte,
               Which are causers of lying, and yll reporte:
               And he is a foole both euen and morrow,
               That nothyng wyll lend, but all thynges borrow.
               And as the prouerbe doth show very playne
               A hood for this foole to kepe him from the rayne.
            
            
               * Of Fooles, yet an other sorte doth come,
               Which neuer seketh for to haue wisedome:
               Many such fooles, wisedome disdayne,
               Yet for their foolishnes they shall suffer payne.
               And as the prouerbe doth shew very playne,
               A hood for this foole, to kepe him from the rayne.
            
            
               ¶ He is a Foole which to others doth preach and tell,
               And yet this foole is ready himself to go vnto hell:
               Liue thou vprightly, be cause of no blame,
               If thou doo not, the more is thy shame.
               And as the prouerbe doth say very playne,
               A hood for this foole, to kepe him from the rayne.
            
            
               * He is a Foole, and euer be shall,
               That others iudgeth, and himself worst of all:
               This foole is blynd, frantike, and wood,
               Without all reason, iudgeth bad thinges good.
               And as the prouerbe doth shew very playne,
               A hood for this foole, to kepe him from the rayne.
            
            
               ¶ He is a Foole that wisedome doth eschue,
               For no good counsell can bring him to vertue:
               This foole which scorneth his neighbour fast,
               Shall be scorned iustly himself at the last.
               And as the prouerbe doth shew very playne,
               A hood for this foole, to kepe him from the rayne.
            
            
               * An other Foole yet, I doe here fynd,
               Which can not kepe close the secrets of his mynd:
               This is a naturall foole, and vndiscrete,
               Which can not hyde his owne counsell and secrete.
               And as the prouerbe doth shew very playne,
               A hood for this foole, to kepe him from the rayne.
            
            
               ¶ He is a Foole, that in youth wyll not prouyde,
               In age must he sterue, or in pouertie abyde:
               This is a foole, and of the numbe one,
               Which in the Sommer can make no prouision.
               And as the prouerbe doth shew very playne,
               A hood for this foole, to kepe him from the rayne.
            
            
               * He is a Foole, that getteth his goods wrongfullye,
               For his heires after him, wyll spend it vnthriftelye:
               This fooles golde is his God, wrongfullye got,
               Why yu foole, thy golde is muk &amp; clay, knowest thou not?
               And as the prouerbe doth shew very playne,
               A hood for this foole, to kepe him from the rayne.
            
            
               ¶ He is a Foole, whether he be man or wyfe,
               Whice styll deliteth in discorde and stryfe:
               Such fooles their owne flesh to the bones may gnaw,
               That contendeth in matters, scant worth a straw.
               And as the prouerbe doth shew very playne,
               A hood for this foole, to kepe him from the rayne.
            
            
               * He is a Foole that on message is sent,
               And when he is on his way, forgot whether he went:
               This féele is worthy of the bable and the bell,
               For of all other fooles, he doth excell.
               And as the prouerbe doth shew very playne,
               A hood for this foole, to kepe him from the rayne.
            
            
               ¶ Yet of Fooles, a whole dozen I haue espyed,
               And lead in a stryng, together they are tyed:
               These fooles you may know by their fauour,
               For lyke the Aspen leafe, with euery wynd they wauer.
               And as the prouerbe doth shew very playne,
               A hood for these fooles, to kepe them from the rayne.
            
            
               * He is a Foole, that thinketh it great wonder,
               When God stryketh by lightnyng and thunder:
               Alas, we dayly without all dread commit
               Much cursed vice, for lacke of godly wit.
               And as the prouerbe doth shew very playne,
               A hood for this foole, to kepe him from the rayne.
            
            
               ¶ All youth, I doo lyken vnto Fooles blynd,
               That vnto their Parents are rebels vnkynd:
               Thou vnkynd chylde, and foole disobedient,
               Remember what goods thy fréends on thée spent.
               And as the prouerbe doth shew very playne,
               A hood for these fooles, to kepe them from the rayne.
            
            
               * He is a Foole, that greatly doth flatter and boast,
               When he thinks least, he shall tast of the rost:
               This foole at last, is cast out of fauour,
               For flatteryng pleaseth no wise man of honour.
               And as the prouerbe doth shew very playne,
               A hood for this foole, to kepe him from the rayne.
            
            
               ¶ He is a Foole, and voyd of all prudence,
               Which to vayne tales doth geue all his credence:
               Therfore remember this both low and hye,
               That flatterers speake fayre when they doo lye.

               * He is a naturall Foole, and a very daw,
               That from doing good, his neighbour doth withdraw:
               Such froward fooles, all goodnes they defile,
               If their neighbours doe good, then they reuile.
               And as the prouerbe doth shew very playne,

               ¶ He is a Foole, and greatly vnprouable,
               That in all his doings he is vnfortunable:
               But in his misfortune he is so blynd,
