            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            TO MY MOST HONORED, FREE, AND BOVNTIFVLL Patron, Sir HENRY WILOVGHBY, Baronet, and to his most worthy Lady, all blessings of this, and a better life.
            
               Sir,
            
            
               THe ignorant generally complaine of too much preaching, and some learned of too much writing. The first haue no eyes to see, either the grace of God in his word, or their owne want of grace, for want of that grac
                  •
               ous word. The other (I thinke) in this, haue squint eyes, or at least looke not the r
                  •
               ght way to the Gospell. For did they condemne onely the wanton, idle, and vaine Pamphlets, (which too licentiously pandaring for lust) stand forth in every shop, or those turbulent libells, which being engendered in earthly mindes, breake forth into all bitternesse, and fill the world with stormes and schismes, who would not rise up with them against the wicked? But the bookes by
them censured, nay despised, and derided, are such as tend to edification; and are scorned, either because they savour not of profound and deepe learning, or not bumbasted with multiplicitie of reading, or not stucke thicke enough with the flowers of Rhetorike; when yet our owne experience makes us see these despised labours wonderfully to prosper in the Church: whether it bee that the Lord delights to glorifie his power in infirmitie, and takes no pleasure in the wisedome of words, (which makes the crosse of Christ of no effect) or as light, so the word, is most cleere and powerfull, when least mixed. Famous is that historie of Sozomen, who hath left it upon record, that in the first Councell of Nice, when an heathen Philosopher did not a little stumble the learned Christians, a simple old man stept out, and with plaine dealing both confuted, and converted him: No question there is great, and even necessarie use of those speciall gifts in the Church: yet by such examples the Lord plainely shewes, that hee will not haue his meanest grace despised. I am perswaded, that with as much reason, and lesse blasphemie wee may quarrell with the Creator, for making so many rivers and fountaines on earth, so many starres in heaven; as with the Redeemer, and blessed Spirit, for storing this Kingdome with those gifts which make it as a watered garden, and another firmament, full of glorious lights, shedding their beames into every corner.
            For my selfe, if any desire to know the reasons impelling mee to write what before I had spoken, and giue way to my private and weake meditations to
looke out in publike, upon so learned an Age; the chiefe are these.
            
               
                   First; That redoubled and trebled commaund of our most gracious Saviour,Iohn 21. 15. 16. 17. 
                  Feed my sheepe, together with that inforcing motiue, As thou lovest mee. Oh! who can loue him sufficiently who loved to death, whose loue passeth knowledge?Ephe. 3. 
                        •
                     9. Or how can any man feed too much, when no man can loue enough? Therefore that Apostle, there so adjured, contented not himselfe to feed by preaching, but to this day feedes us by his writing. The same precept is often by his blessed Spirit pressed upon his Ministers:1 Pet. 5. 2. and 4. 10. 
                  Feed the flocke of Christ. As every man hath received the gift, so let him administer it 
                        •
                     o other,
                  Act .20. 28. 
                  as good Stewards of the manifold graces of God. Take heed to your selues, and to the flocke, over which the holy Ghost hath made you Overseers to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchased with his owne bloud. O strong adjuration! Now God forbid, that I should ever esteeme any paines sufficient for that, for which God thought not his bloud too much.
               
                   Secondly; The streight account which our Soveraigne Lord hath foretold he will exact of all his servants,Math. 25. 26. 30. to whom he commits these treasures of his grace, so that the single talent shall bee accountable, and the slothfull person adjudged to a fearefull condemnation, and execution for not putting it to the banke.
               
                   Thirdly; The profit of Gods people, especially those committed to me by Christ. Surely there is a wonderfull loue betweene a faithfull Pastor
                  and his faithfull people. The Galatians could giue their eyes;Gal. 4. 15.
                  Rom. 16. 4. 
                  Aquila and Priscilla their liues to the Apostle. But beyond all admiration was the loue of that Apostle,2 Cor. 12. 5. who not onely loved the more,
                  Phil. 1. 22. 23. 24. 
                  the lesse he was beloved, their neglect (as it were by Antiperistasis) kindling, and enflaming his affections, but could willingly deferre his joyes with Christ in heaven, and still liue under the bloudie persecution of Iewes, Gentiles, false Brethren, and (which is worse then all these) the fierie opposition, and loathsome, but forced struglings with remainders of sinne, that hee might build the Church. He knew not which to choose, his presence with Christ in infinite felicitie, or his edifying the Church with all worldly miserie.
               
                   Lastly; Though there be euē innumerable lights heaven, yet is ther not one in vaine: the very least and most obscure haue their use, their light, and influence: yea those infinite little starres, which by us cannot be discerned, by reason, partly of their distance, partly of their smalnesse, yet doe they paue, embrighten, and point out that milkie way in heaven. And I doubt not, but this little and weake worke shall through his power, who brings light out of da
                     •
                  kenesse, direct some, or further them in that blessed way to eternall life.
            
            But it may bee, some will stop my way with slight e
                  •
               tertainment, and strong opposition of the world.
            This cannot weigh with those stronger arguments inciting mee to this dutie. I remember the Astronomers distinguish the visible fixt starres
into six severall magnitudes; Those of the first and chiefest exceed the whole earth in quantitie an hundred and seven-fold, and even the most obscure and cloudy of the sixt magnitude, eighteen-fold with advantage. Thus those first and great starres (the holy Apostles,) their followers and immediate Successours how wonderfully they did surmount the whole earth, may easily appeare in this; that when all the world interposed it selfe to ecclipse their light, yet did they then shine more bright, and filled the whole earth with the glorious splendour of the Gospell of Christ. So even in these last ages, we haue knowne that notwithstanding all the opposition of Popes, Emperours, and many other Princes (the whole earth indeed being banded against a very few, and farre inferiour to those fi
                  •
               st Ministers) yet did they overcome all their malice, and shed the long obscured light into all parts of the Christian world. For my selfe I rest assured, that one heavenly sparke in the least of those starres shining in the right hand of Christ shall not, nor cannot by any earthly opposition bee so ecclipsed, but that it shall breake through, and both enlighten, and enflame some of those whom God hath chosen.
            It may be some also will object, that other more learned, and every way more sufficient, haue already laboured in this Vineyard, and set forth their workes on this Psalme.
            I willingly confesse it: yet I know not any more but one, even that eloquent Apollos,
               M. Bolton.
                powerfull and mightie in the word; and am certaine, that
learned and religious men will not disdaine, that when hee from this living fountaine hath filled his silver Cisterne, I should also with my earthly pitcher draw, and poure out some of the same water of life unto the sheepe of my Master.
            
            Now most worthy Patrone, I haue beene bold to entitle you, and your worthy Lady to this labour, not onely in remembrance of your much loue, and my long courteous entertainment in your house (such as I never saw any Gentleman giue unto their Minister;) or that first I initiated my weake Ministerie in your Familie and Hamlet; but especially because I acknowledge my selfe, and whatsoever is mine
            
               Yours in the Lord Iesus Christ; To whose grace, and fulnes of it, he shall ever commend you, and all yours, who thirsts and longs for your soule; PHINEES FLETCHER.
               
            
         
         
            
            To my deere Parishioners of HILGAY in NORFOLKE.
            
            
               CHristian Brethren, my conscience, and he tha

                is greater then the conscience beares me witnes, that I never spared any paines for your profit, either publike or private, but by prayer for you, and preaching to you, haue laboured with all, nay aboue my strength, to bring you to that true knowledge of God, and our Lord Iesus Christ; and settle you in his grace. What is wrought in every ones heart God onely knowes. But (blessed be his name for ever) some fruit the Lord of the Harvest hath made me see springing, some even ripening, which hath encouraged me to publish this little worke: not onely that other Christians if it please the Lord, may receiue some helpe, but especially that you of this flocke whom God hath called, may be further builded in your most holy faith; and others who haue yet resisted, may either be recalled and brought home, or else being convinced, haue a testimonie witnessing to their faces their rebellion, and justifying their condemna

                  Ier. 7.9. 10.
                but accounting their malicious and causelesse quarrelling, the second marke of Gods effectuall working by my infirmitie, I haue with more heart and cheerefulnesse laboured in the worke of God. Now my Brethren, and dearely beloved in the Lord Iesus Christ, I be
                  •
               eech you in the Lord, remember and well consider your holy calling: You professe your selues Christians, even the followers of Christ, and you haue, and may here againe evidently discerne the Lord, by his Spirit shewing you the old and good way, and leading you in it by footing of this excellent Prophet. Now manifest your selues to be, as your are and will be called; be Christians: follow the voice of the Lord in his word, follow his followers, and set your feete into the path of life. Will you walke in the counsell of the ungodly? stand in the way of sinners? sit downe in the seat of scorners? Will you sweare, curse, lie, slander? will you drinke, roare, will you speake wantonly, will you with such carelesnesse profane the Sabboth, despise God in his saving Ordinances, neglect the Lord in your families, and then thinke and say, We shall be delivered, though we doe all these abominatiōs? Take heed my Brethren, we serue a most gracious, but yet a jealous God, whose jealousie shall smoke against such despisers, to bring all the fearefull curses temporall and eternall (threatned in the Law) upon such a rebellious miserable creature. Deut. 29. 19. 20.
            
            To conclude (deare Brethren) after whom I long in the bowels of Christ, the Lord hath set before
you life and death, blessing and cursing: the same Lord giue you an heart to choose life, that here waying in grace, hereafter you may be filled with glorie. Amen, LORD IESVS, Amen. So shall ever pray

            ¶ The Preface to every Christian Reader.
            
               IN all Sciences whether liberall, or manuall, that Scholler makes the most happy progresse, whose Master doth first by instruction lay downe before him the grounds of his Art, and then farther opens them by practise, and example. That guide will best conduct us, who not onely points out the way with his finger, but beats it with his foote, and cheerefully calls us after him.
            This happines our great, and onely Doctor affords us in his scriptures, who both propounds distinctly the mysteries of our faith in the Gospell, and the rule of our manners in the law, and with all illustrats both in the plaine tracte, beaten by himselfe, and his faithfull members, whose footsteps of holy faith, and conversation, printed deepe before us, haue made the way much more easie for us that follow.
            It is no small light to us, when we see the combate between the Spi
                     •
                  it, and the flesh doctrinally expressed. Gal. 5. 17. But when we behold it acted personally in the Apostle (Rom. 7.) and view him wrastling with that loathsome, and cumbersome enemie, even the bodie of death, sometime taking, sometime giving the foyle, crying out for helpe, and breaking forth into thankes for his victorie, it doth not onely cleare our understanding, but powerfully workes on our affections, shewes our enemie, and kindles us against him; first teacheth
us, that fight we must; then instructs us how to fight how to overcome, and how to use the conquest.
            Therefore I dare boldly affirme, and every good Christians experience will confirme it, no portion of scripture yeelds more comfort to a soule struggling with sinne, and almost fainting under the burthen of corruption, then that duell there managed by the Apostle under the persōs of all the faithfull. And this is the reason why the booke of Psalmes is by all acknowledged the most profitable, and usefull
                  •
                because we here behold lively drawne, by Gods owne finger, not onely the face, and hands (the outward profession, and actions) but the very heart of that man, who was according to Gods owne heart: and so may take there a full view of every limb, and be acquainted with every joynt, and feature of the new, and inward man: wee shall there see that heart ever in action, continually drawing from that living fountain the word (to which it cleaues unseparably) the waters of life, and having throughly concocted them in the affection, returning them againe to every part for growth and practice.
            Sometime we may perceiue him, as a Conquerour, with that stone which the builders refused, casting downe the Goliah, which de
                  •
               ies the Israel of God, even every high thing, which exalst it selfe against the knowledge of God; yea with his head in his hand, bringing into captivitie every thought to the obedience of Christ; sometime againe fainting (as in the battell with Ishibenob) under the speare of those uncircumcised affections, which still border on Gods people, and are sworne, and restles enemies against the Spirit. Here may you view him tugging, with that roring Lion, who seeks whom he may devour, and reskuing out of his mouth that almost lost sheep; there againe compast about with mighty bulls of Basan, gaping on him with their mouths, bayted with dogs, even the assembly of the wicked, and crying lowd for helpe, that his soule may be delivered from the sword, and the power of the dog. Oft-times
you may heare him, like the Larke, singing, and mounting in his song; his heart well tuned, and his tongue co
                  •

            In a word, the Booke of Psalmes is a field, where we may be most skilfully trained in all our Christian warfare: where this great Commander, famous for earthly, but far more renowned for heavenly victories, will breed us up in skill, and courage by his owne example: where, of the one side wee shall learne to know all our spirituall enemies, their colours, weapons, stratagems, their manner of charging; of the other side our Captain, succours, armours offensive, and defensive, our discipline, conflict, victory, and triumph, and all these not onely by relation, but action in our fellow-souldier, and an old experienced Commander.

            A Treatise or Commentarie vpon the first Psalme.
            Psalme I.
            
               
                  
                     1 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the Counsell of the vngodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seate of the scornefull.
                  
                     2 But his delight is in the Law of the Lord, and in his Law doth he meditate day and night.
                  
                     3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruite in his season, his leafe also shall not wither, and whatsoever he doth shall prosper.
                  
                     4 The vngodly are not so; but are like the chaffe which the winde driveth away.
                  
                     5 Therefore the vngodly shall not stand in judgement, nor sinners in the Congregation of the righteous.
                  
                     6 For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, and the way of the wicked shall perish.
               
            
            
               
                  BLessednesse is that greatest good of man, which all desire and seeke for it selfe, and all other things for it: that Haven of rest, to which man driues with all his sailes, and oares, and there vnfraughts all his thoughts and actions; sits downe, and so acquieteth his soule, Where it is situate, and how to shape our course to attaine it, no Card or Compasse, but onely Gods Word can
direct vs. They which saile thither without this Needle (doe but obserue them) after with their guide they haue compassed Sea and Land, finish their voyage in the dead Sea. Most men, and almost all that travaile this way, are wasted by such Pilots, that it is no maruaile to see them so widely or wildely to erre and wander.
            The Covetous man sets Mammon at the sterne, and makes no doubt, but to arriue safely there with such a guide The Ambitious chuseth Lucifer, and fully perswades himselfe to attaine it by his direction. The Voluptuous takes along Beliall with him, (that dissolute and vnthriftie companion) and feares not, while he holds the rudder, to touch at this Land of Happinesse. The very best, and wisest not onely of the Heathen, but worldly Professours resting themselues vpon Morality, and Forme, haue seemed to themselues and others a long time to make a good voyage, but all at length split at one rocke, and meete in the gulfe of destruction.
            Some few embarking themselues in that sure, but despised Vessell of Gods word, and vtterly reiecting all other Pilots, giving vp themselues vnto the direction of the blessed Spirit, haue, not indeed without many stormes, yet safely landed their soules in that blessed Haven, and possessed the inheritance of rest and promise.Prov. 8. 31. Hence it is that the Wisedome of God whose delights are with the children of men,
               Mat. 9. 36. seeing such multitudes scattered, and wandring as sheepe without a shepheard, hath compassion on them, and aswell by his owne, as by this his King of Heralds voyce, and by his Sonne (the wisest type of Wisedome) calls to these wandring wretches:Prov. 9.6. 
               Forsake your way yee foolish, and you shall liue, and walke in the way of vnderstanding.
            
            Now of this Psalme, (where our happy estate is excellently described, and the way to it plainely poynted out to vs) it is fit to consider aswell the Authour as the matter. The Authour is either principall, or subordinate, our head Iesus Christ, who by his Spirit indited it, and
the Prophet David, whom he vsed as his Secretary, or hand to write it. The scope, as of all other Scripture, is to be a lampe vnto our feete, and a light vnto our paths,
               Psal. 119.105 and as the very finger of God, to point out the new, and dangerous, but intising way to misery, and the old, and safe way, which leads to happinesse. The method or order is this. First our Guide shewes us a farre off, a generall &amp; confused view of blessednes; the end of all our travell: then points out the left-hand way, which to an unwary eye seemes faire, and likely, and warnes us to take heed of it; which more perfectly he describes, by the severall periods of it. These are three. 1. walking in the counsell of the ungodly; 2. standing in the way of sinners; 3. sitting in the seate of the scornefull:
            All this in the first verse.
            Secondly, he sets out the true way to happines, which seemes the farthest about, but is the neerest home
                  •
                and our severall journies in it, which are but two: first delighting; secondly, meditating in Gods word, which is amplified from the time, day and night: And this is contained in the second verse.
            Thirdly, in the next place he more distinctly and severally discovers this happinesse, that so he may winne us to it; First, by a most familiar and elegant similitude of a tree: 1. planted: 2. watered: 3. fruitfull: 4. flourishing: then by a part of it namely, prosperity. This in the 3 verse.
            Fourthly h
                  •
                displayes the woefull estate of those who goe the other way; first negatiuely, They are not so: not blessed, not planted, not watered, not fruitfull, not flourishing, they prosper not. Againe affirmatiuely, by a comparison: they are as chaffe blowne away with the wind; and therefore shall be separated from the wheat, and burnt with fire. This is deliver

               rses.
            Lastly in the sixt, he giues an infallible reason of all he speakes, namely, the providence of God over-looking, and disposing both.
            Now as a Guide, who undertakes onely to bring us
in the right way to our journies end, in our passage will beguile the way with some discourse, or name to us the Townes, Castles, Rivers, &amp;c. by which we passe. So this holy Saint leading us forward, entertaines the way with much profitable matter: pointing out though obscurely old Babilon, and new Ierusalem, the false, and true Church with their lawes and manners. Having thus prepared the way, let us now enter upon it, and in the first wee'l obserue the Guide himselfe; from whom we gather this proposition.
            
               
               Proposition.
               The Prophet David, and in him, the holy Ghost is the Author of this Psalme.
            
            And that we may profit the more by this Teacher, let us consider how he is qualified for this office: wise Princes, if they cannot make men fit for any place, will chuse such as are already made to their hand. But the Lords election prepares, and enables his servants for any calling in his Church. Let us then behold him either in his spirituall or temporall estate. First God tooke him (the youngest of many brethren) from following the sheepe, and made him a Shepheard of men; King over his onely people, the house of Israell; and so filled his heart with wisedome, valour, and other gifts necessary for government, that never any Prince joyntly in them all, was more, or indeed equally renowned. He blessed his raigne with many famous victories;2 Sam. 7. 9. 
               was with him wheresoever he went, cut off all his enemies, and made him a great name, like the name of the great men which are on the earth.
            
            Secondly, his spirituall estate may be considered either in his publike office,2 Chron. 8.14 as he was a Prophet, a man of God, none more famous among the Prophets: or in his private disposition,Acts 13, 22. 
               a man after Gods owne heart, propounded as a patterne, especially to Princes; whence it is that all his successours are either condemned for not following him, or commended for treading in his footsteps.
            
               For confirmation of this Proposition,
                  Proofe.
                it is evident that the Holy Ghost is the prime Author of the Booke of Psalmes: For all Scripture is inspired, and holy men spake as they were moved by the holy Ghost.
               2 Tim. 3. 16. Moreover our Saviour reckons the Psalmes with Moses,
               2 Pet. 1. 20. 21. &amp; the Prophets as holy Scripture:Luke 24. 44. 45. Luk. 20.42. and David by Christ is entituled to this Booke: and the Scripture giues evident witnesse of the Spirit speaking by him;2 Sam. 23.1,2 
               The Spirit of the Lord spoke by me, and his word was in my tongue.
            
            It will not be vnprofitable to lay downe some reasons or grounds of this action,
                  Grounds.
                aswell in God the principall, as in David the subordinate Author. The cause then why God writes, and writes in this kinde, by songs, and why he employes David, as his hand, are either in himselfe, in vs, or in this holy Proph
                  •
               t. In himselfe his gracious will and wisedome;Luke 10. 21. 
               He reveales and conceales these things, because it so pleaseth him. See also Exod. 33. 13. 17. and Numb. 12. 6, 7, 8. In vs whom he teacheth, there are some occasions, as 1. our difficulty in learning, especially things spirituall. 2. our naturall delight in Musicke. 3. A certaine aptnesse in numbers to convey to our mindes, and settle in our memories these profitablelessons. The reasons why he vseth David in this imployment, may be 1. the gift of Musicke, in which he excelled. 2. the sanctifying gifts of Gods Spirit, which afforded ditties to his notes, and by expressing his holy affections, filled others, on all o
                  •
               casions, to lay open, and poure out their hearts to God in prayer. In Dauid the cause of writing may be 1. his Faith:Psal. 116. 10. 
               I beleeved therfore I spake. 2. his loue, desiring to draw others on to that happinesse, which himselfe had found. Ioyne these together, and we shall find a good ground of this action. We are vnapt to learne, there is an aptnesse in this kind of teaching to sinke easier, and deeper into our mindes: God knowes in his wisedome what is best for vs, and his loue will effect it; therefore having-fitted David with this qualitie of holy Musicke, he stirres vp his
heart to vtter by faith, what he had learned, and by loue to draw on our lagging affections to the like gracious practise.
            
               2 Tim. 3. 16.Now be

               ause the Word of God whether written, or preached, is given for our vse and profit, for teaching, confuting, trying, comforting, and exhorting, that by applying it partly to our vnderstanding, we might grow in light, and be better informed in our judgement, partly, to our will and affections, we might be reformed, let vs see what vse we may make of this point, and first for our instruction.
            
               Instruction. 1. Learne then here, that man is of an indocible nature, especially in things spirituall, hard to conceive, prone to forget; why else should God himselfe vndertake this Office? Why should he employ so many Writers? so many Speakers? furnish them with all multiplicity of learning, great variety of gifts, singular, and divers vtterance? Had we a good capacity to conceive the lessons of the Spirit, were we of firme memory, to retaine what we had rightly conceived, all this labour had bin in vaine, and needlesse.
            No surely, our vnderstandings are over-whelmed with a thicke mist, an AEgyptian palpable darkenesse, not easily dispelled by this glorious light; well may the beames of Gods word shine round about vs,Zach. 7.12. but vntill the Spirit of God shine in our hearts, and opens a window for it, not one sparke of light can enter.

               Can a maid forget her ornament, or a bride her attire? yet my people haue forgotten me dayes without number. O you of little faith, why doe you thinke thus?

                Consider here, as well Gods wonderfull patience, compassion, and goodnes to us, in admitting to his schoole such untoward scholars, and our happinesse in such a Teacher. Happy is the child, who being rude, and unteachable, dull, and blockish, meets with a Master skilfull to handle him, and patient in his defects; Our Doctor hath the keyes of David, not onely to unseale the booke, but to unlock our mindes, able to make poore Fishermen instructors to the wisest, &amp; most learned of all the world.

               ble is his patience,1 Pet. 3. 20
               Psal. 95. 10. with what great forbearance did he instruct the old world by Noah? How long did he suffer the indocible Israelits in the wildernes? See also Esay 30. 18. As a man who meets with an unapt Scholar, plies him early and late, and supplies with his owne diligence, what the childe wants in parts; so the Lord rises vp early every day, applies himselfe to us in all manner of teaching, speaking to our eyes, in his workes, Scripture, and Sacraments, to the eares by preaching in season, and out of season, mingling even pleasure with profit, instructing with delight, and builds vp our soules with songs. If wee count our selues happy when we haue placed our childe with a skilfull, honest, patient, and painefull man, who will teach him in any trade; infinitely happy are wee, that we are entred into his Schoole, who is the onely Doctor. Verily that which the Heathens fained of their Amphion, we finde true in our selues by experience; that this heauenly musicke of our diuine Singer, gathers together stony hearts, quickens, and fits them to the Temple of Gods Spirit.

Remember then, and say with thy selfe: It is that Divine wisedome, that Spirit of Truth,

In all thy course let this thought of thy Guide never depart from thee, but commune thus with thine owne heart: what is there that should stop me in this way? What is there that should not rather incite and hasten me? Shall I say? I have great possessions, promoted to some high o

They had almost conumed mee upon earth, but I forsooke not thy precepts: The proud have had me exceedingly in derision, yet have I not declined from thy Law. I am small, and despised, yet doe I not forget thy statutes. Trouble and anguish are come upon mee, yet are thy Commandements my delight.

Let us here not so much refute, as detest and accurse those Popish blasphemies concerning this, and other Scriptures: Surely though a reverend opinion, and speech of the written Word, be not ever an infallible signe of a faithfull Christian, yet an un-reverend aestimation, contemptuous, and disgracefull speech, is a sure argument of infidelity, and Atheisme. The Ancients received the Scriptures as the Iudge sent from heaven, and the voyce of Christ, which they durst not censure, but by which they censured all other writings; yeelding to the Canonicall Scriptures, and to them alone, an un-deniable consent. Thus Origen, thus Austen;

Thus Nazianzen, Austen, Chrysostome, Bernard. Now how they which boast so much of Antiquitie, and the onely Church, agree with the Ancients, and with the true Church, we may perceive in this particulars. It is almost incredible how basely, and despitefully they speake of the Oracles of God. Let me cleare this point a little. 1. They a

It is strange to see what strangers men are at home; like some idle Gallants, who wander through all the world, and know nothing of their owne Countrey:Prov. 17.24. So these Salomons fooles, their eyes walke through the world, but never looke into their owne hearts. Surely as the eyes of our body stand naturally outward, and cannot turne themselues to spie out any thing within; so the mindes of naturall men can rowle themselues every way, but haue no sight inward. Hence it is, that wicked men being altogether unacquainted with themselues, and meere forreiners in their owne hearts, cannot endure to be alone: (which the Philosopher giues as a good reason, why impious men hate solitarinesse;) and hence flowes that vaine, and proud conceit of our owne abilities, despising &amp; censuring others, discerning every mote in our neighbours, but not the beame in our owne eye. How scornfully
did the Pharises heare themselues taxed with blindnesse?Ioh. 9.39. 40. They could soone spie the Apostles hands unwashed, but never dreamt of their own unwashed hearts and those stinking in-sides which never felt any water.Mat 15. 2.
               Luke 5.33. How soone could they finde out the Apostles not so frequently fasting, as themselues? but the stewes in their owne eyes, fraught with adulteries, the carrion of their owne spirits rotting in the graue of hypocrisie, but fairely whited over, they never thought of it. As the blind man in the Gospell could perceiue nothing, till his eyes began to be opened, but then soone had feeling of his imperfection in sight, and the first thing he saw was his want of perfect sense, discerning men as trees: so while we lie in the darkenesse of ignorance, we discover no weaknesse; but so soone as the light of Gods spirit enters into the heart, we presently finde out a world of wickednesse: what man is able (till God set in his hand) to make the ignorant man see and acknowledge his ignorance? As the naturall, so the spirituall foole, the greater ideot he is, the better hee conceits of himselfe, as wiser then seven men that can render a reason.
               Prov. 26.16. The truth is they haue not so much wit as to know they haue none: who can perswade the naturall man,

               Doe but you (say they to Moses) heare God, and declare it to us, and wee will heare and doe it: this they ignorantly and arrogantly spake of themselues, when yet God had not given them hearts to perceiue, eyes to see, eares to heare unto that day. Thus is it at this day with those, whose eyes, eares, and hearts God hath not opened; they neither doe, nor can perceiue their owne wants, and so thinke, and speake proudly of themselues, that they haue good hearts to God, that they haue good intents, strong faith, loue to God with all their soules, &amp;c. But when God sheds his light into their soules, what a cloud of ignorance, hardnes of heart, what coldnesse, what deadnes, what unbeliefe, what a

               ngers is treating with them. When we read the word, too seldome doe we obserue who holds the hand of the writer, and thus the devill steales away our life from us. Certainely most hearers are as the high way, their hearts and eares so traversed and trampled by vaine thoughts, and worldly cares going and comming, and continually passing to and fro, that they heare little, obserue lesse, profit nothing: why doe not we spie out our dissolute behaviour, and judge our selues before God?Ier. 5.12. Nay how many are there which deny the Lord, and say it is not he? The obstinate resolution of many to continue in sinne, so hardens their hearts, that they deny their own

            See those Israelites; they knew Ieremy a true Prophet, (for they had a deare-bought experience of God speaking by him) therefore they come to inquire of him,Ier. 42.2:5. &amp; 43. 2. and solemnly sweare to follow the advice of God given by him: yet when he crost them in their particular and purposed
designes, they giue him (nay indeed their owne consciences witnessing for him) the lie; Thou speakest slalsly. Thus when the covetous heareth the thunders of the word against riotours, or the riotour against the niggard, they can yeeld some honour to it, and at least in word acknowledge the voice of God: but when the reproofe is brought home to their owne doores, and layd to their hearts, then presently we shall heare, the Prophets shall be as the winde, the word is not in them, thus shall it be to them.
               Ier. 5.13.
            
            If we could but open our eyes to see the danger of this carelesse behaviour, surely it would provoke us to more diligence; the danger either in respect of God or the creature. The crowes are not so busie in thy seed-time, as these wicked spirits in this heavenly tillage to make thee a fruitlesse and so an accursed ground. How lamentable were the estate of a Towne halfe affamished, and round beleagred with a strong enemy, who kept them from all succour, that they might see even at their gates store of corne sent by their friends, but no entrance for it by reason of the enemy. This is their condition: The food of eternall life is sent by Christ, brought by his messengers, stands ready at the eare to enter, but the devill barres the gate, and turnes it from them. In respect of God the danger is yet greater; for he hath protested to yeeld us the like measure,Marke 4. 24. as we shall see more largely hereafter: if we suffer him thus to goe after us, intreating us to turne, and be reconciled, and we are carelesse; the tide shall change, when we shall as earnestly cry and howle for mercy, and he will laugh at our destruction: see his word, Prov. 1. 24, 26, 28. and the deed answering it, Zach. 7. 12, 13.

the power and authoritie, or the loue of the speaker, or matter of the speech, necessity of attention lies upon my soule. He is my soveraigne Lord,

Thus when we haue provoked our hearts to this dutie, let us inquire the meanes enabling us to performe it, and constantly practise them. Meanes 1. Labour to emptie thy heart, and to cast out the ignorant conceit of knowledge;Luke 1.53. 
               he feedes the hungry: Away with that proud opinion of goodnesse and abilitie. 2. Consider the necessitie, and the nature of the word, purposely sent to supply it,Rom. 1. 16. being the wisedome and power of God to saluation.
            
            
               
                  Verse I. Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsell of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seate of the scornfull.
               The body of this Psalme hath these two especiall members. 1. The double estate of man. 2. The cause of it; both which the Holy Ghost propounds as the strongest incentiues to godlinesse. The first is as a cord of loue to draw; the second as a whip to driue us. The estate of man is either blessed and happy, or cursed and miserable. The blessed described first more confusedly and generally, in that word Blessed (or as in the Hebrew blessednesses) where thus God reasons with us; Thou desirest to be blessed, all thy actions, all thy wishes tend to this issue: but loe yonder is true blessednes, and I am here ready to be thy Guide, and haue to this end lent thee my word, to be a lampe to thy feete, and a light to thy pathes,
                  Psal. 119.105 up then, follow me, and I will certainely bring thee to all thy wishes.
               
                  Secondly, he points out the way to attaine it: and first that which must be left and forsaken, which is three fold; 1. the counsell of the ungodly: 2. standing with sinners. 3. sitting with the scornefull. Then he sets out the path, which we must take, and walke in: namely, the Word, this we doe as well by delighting, as meditating in it: these are the two feete which carry us in the way to happinesse, and this meditation amplified by the time, day and night; so thus God pleads with us, would'st thou goe in the strait way to happinesse? the shortest cut, nay the onely tract is by holinesse, take heed therefore of those three left-hand paths: thou shalt see ungodly men walke in evill counsell, obstinate sinners stand in perverse wayes, mockers sit downe in the chaire of scorning: all these may seeme to flesh and bloud faire and likely; but take thou heed, turne aside, and enter not into them, and know that they lead thee through vanity to destruction: but loe, there lies directly before thee, a narrow path of meditating, and delighting in the word of God, set in thy foot here, take this strait way, and it shall certainly bring thee to thy desired ends: and know howsoever it seemes at first hard, and much about, thou shalt finde it pleasant, and the neerest way to thy home.
               Thirdly, this happy condition of man is more particularly set out to the view, and clearely revealed unto us. 1. by a most elegant similitude of a tree, 1. planted: 2- watered: 3. fruitfull: 4. ever flourishing: 2. by some part of it, namely Prosperitie, where thus againe our Guide confers with us; Lift up thine eyes now, and behold right before thee the joy of life, the crown of thy labours, the haven of all thy desires; see how directly this path leads thee to the true vine Christ Iesus, and grafts thee in him, in whom onely thou art blessed with all spirituall blessings: behold how these waters of the Sanctuary flowing from the well of life, fill thee with fruit, and sustaine thee in a most flourishing estate: consider from
the time thou hast constantly set thy foote in this way, I will blesse thee, and make a
                     •
                  l thy wayes to prosper.
               In the next place the cursed state of man is laid downe 1. negatiuely, not so the wicked; that is, not blessed, but cursed; not planted, but wilde; not watered, but parched; not fruitfull, but barren; not 
                        •
                     lourishing, but withering, and blasted; not prospering, but confounded: 2. positiuely, 1. by a comparison of chaffe, driven by the winde: 2. by a double consequent, they cannot stand in the day of judgement, nor in the congregation of the just.
               
               Lastly he shewes the cause of both
                     •
                   namely, the Providence of God over-looking and over-ruling all creatures where yet further we may heare our gracious God instructing us: Looke yonder, and view well the issue and end of these men, which take the other way, 
                     ••
                  e further they goe, the further they wander from that which they seeke, they are in a very wildernes, wilde, dry, and barren, see there how they are stubbed up, and cast into the fire:Psal. 73.19. 
                  how sodainly are they destroyed, perished, &amp; horribly consumed? Know then the pathes of men are directed by the Lord, waite thou therefore on the Lord,
                  Psal. 37.23. 24. 
                  and keepe his way, and hee shall exalt thee, and thou shalt inherit the Land: when the wicked men shall perish, thou shalt see it.
               
               Now in this first verse obserue 1. the way: 2. those that goe in it: 3. their proceedings or journies: every one of these expressed in three severall degrees; In the way marke 1. the entrance, counsell: 2. the continuance or progresse, the habituall practise of sin more specially here called the way: 3. the uttermost extent of it rest or seate.
               
               The persons of wicked men going in this way, are either the ungodly (dissolute careles men,Phil. 3.19. 
                  whose belly is their God, who mind earthly things) hypocrites and Atheists in heart, who haue given up and sold themselues unto the world: or 2. the sinner, the notorious customary sinner, who proclaimes his sinne as Sodome: 3. the mocker, who derides, and makes a jest of Religion: Lastly,
their proceedings are metaphorically expressed by those three positions of the body, walking, standing, and sitting.
               
               This then is the first proposition offering it selfe to our consideration.
               
                  
                  Proposition.
                  The Prophet pronounceth them blessed who walke not in the counsell of the ungodly.
               
               Wh
                     •
                  re some words had need to be unfolded. 1. That word Blessed, is of the plurall number in the originall, and literally should be rendred Blessednesses: for blessednesse is the summe of many particular blessings, and may be considered, either in the beginnings or perfection of it. The perfect blessednesse consisteth in a full removall of all evill, and ceaseles enjoying all that good of which we are 
                     ••
                  pable. The imperfect blessednesse may stand with many evils, but requireth such proportion of good which out-weighs the evill for the present, and will at length certainely end in perfection.Mat. 5. 11. For our Saviour doubts not to pronounce those blessed, who are grievously persecuted; and the reason is,Rom. 5. 3. &amp; 8. 18. because we rejoyce in tribulation, and the present afflictions are not worthy of the glory which shall be shewed us: nay, he affirmeth those that mourne blessed;Mat. 5.4. and such as hunger and thirst for righteousnesse; and obserue the reason there given by our Lord, because (though they are not yet) they shall bee satisfied. Thus the eternall Truth, who is blessed for ever, and the fountaine of all blessings, and blessednes, doubts not to stile those blessed, who prest with much evill, yet haue more comfort, and though yet imperfect, shall in time attaine perfection.
               2 Walking, is a common metaphor in Scripture, signifying our conversation and frame of life. The body is said to walke, when the feete carry it from one place to another; so when our affections and desires moue us from the practise of good to evill, or from evill to good, we are said to walk in it: thus to walke after the Law, is to frame our conversation to the direction of the law,

               3. Counsel may be here takē either for the devise which men follow themselues, or advise which they giue us.
               4. The ungodly are such who haue no true knowledg of God, to feare, trust, and loue him, but either openly in word (as some) or as more in their deeds proclaime their Atheisme of heart, or else closely deceiving others, and many times th

                  mselues (as those Scribes and Pharises hypocrites) under profession of religion bury a dead &amp; rotten heart. This then is the 
                     •
                  ense of the words. Whosoever forsakes the advise which Atheists and hypocrites take themselues, and giue others; and avoid them, not conversing, or framing his life with them in their course, he is already in a blessed estate, not indeed of perfection, but yet such as here out-weighing any evill, will surely bring him to perfection.
               
               This is proved by frequent testimonies:
                     Proofe.

                        •
                      he was gone, and I sought him, but he could not be found. 3. His compassion and pittie to wandring soules, carried away with the vaine pompe, and seeming prosperity of the wicked. 4. The spreading nature of grace, wherewith his heart was seasoned, which contrary to earthly happinesse, delights
lights to impart it selfe to others, as knowing that maine difference betwixt earthly and heavenly riches, that the earthly are diminished, the heavenly multiplied by distribution.
               
                  
                  Instruction.These may be the grounds of this action in the Prophet, whence we learne first this Instruction;
               As long as thou livest in this wicked world, thou shalt not faile to heare wicked counsell; ungodly men will be at both eares, and not cease to giue thee such advice, as may provoke to lewd and ungodly courses. Thou shalt heare the profane Atheist (perhaps more covertly, yet to the same purpose) perswade thee:Iob 21.15. 
                  Who is the Almighty that we should serue him, and what profit should we haue if we should pray unto him?
                  Mal. 3.14,15. 
                  It is in vaine to serue God, and to walke humbly before him: the proud are blessed, and they that worke wickednes are set up, and they that tempt God, are delivered. Thou shalt heare the unrighteous man intising:Pro. 1.11,12, 13, 14. 
                  Come with us, we will lay wait for bloud, and lie privily for the innocent without a cause; we will swallow them up aliue, like a graue, evē whole, as they that go down into the pit: we shall find all precious riches, and fill our houses with spoile. Cast in thy lot among us, we will all haue one purse. Thou shalt heare the intemperate man perswading:Isay 56. 12. 
                  come I will bring wine, and wee will fill ourselues with strong drinke, and to morrow shall be as this day and much more abundant:
                  1 Cor. 15. 32. 
                  Come let us eat and drinke, for to morrow we shall dye. That malicious enemy of man is a cunning fowler; he hath ever his stalking horse by him, and when he hath taken any captiue soule, he makes it a stall to invite others: most forcibly he allures, when he is least seene; therefore will he ever shroud himselfe there, where he is least suspected: he will hide himselfe behind some good friend, who wishes us well;Gen. 3. 6. he will borrow Eves hand to reach the apple to Adam, and his wiues tongue to shake Iobs patience,Iob. 2.9. hee will abuse his well-meaning friends by planting in repentance, to roote out his faith.
               
                  Thus he covered his serpents sting in Peters tongue, Master spare thy selfe:

                   When the heart is salted with grace, it seasons not onely the whole man, but desires also to spread it selfe further to all other, with whom he converseth. Hence the Kingdome of God is compared to leaven,
                  Mat. 13.33. which is hid in three peckes of meale, till all is leavened.Marke 9.50. Fitly is grace resembled to salt, which hath not onely seasoning in it selfe, but imparts it to any thing that toucheth it:Psal. 34. 8

And as the naturall life in all creatures desires to impart it selfe, and to bring forth the like; so especially in this new creature, (as being farre more good, and therefore more communicatiue.) Hence also is it, that the Prophet describes the calling of the Gentiles by their mutuall exhortations, and inciting one the other: Come let us goe up into the mountaine of the Lord, and he will teach us his wayes, and we will walke in his pathes, and presently after the Prophet from an holy zeale and emulation cals out to his Country-men:Esay 2

                   as a part of our perfect happinesse. But this separation must be first inward in the heart: as a bodily eye cannot see a spirituall substance, so a carnall man cannot with a fleshly eye perceiue spirituall things, hence he judges them foolish.1 Cor. 2. 14. The spirituall man by a spirituall light seeth and acknowledgeth it to be the wisedome of God: And we speake wisedome among them that are perfect, not the wisedome of this world,

The carnall person savours the things of the flesh; he feeles no sweetnesse, no relish in those spiritual dainties,Rom. 8. 5. but embraces the present world, and takes his portion in it. Contrary,Rom. 8.5. the spirituall man savours the things of the spirit: how sweete are thy words unto my taste, yea sweeter then honey unto my mouth! Thy testimonies haue I taken for an heritage for euer: for they are the rejoycing of my heart:

                     Id. l. 4. c. 14. and of Polycarpus his scholler, that when he was saluted by Marcion, a notorious hereticke, and demanded in a familiar manner if he knew him, he instantly answered, I know thee the first-borne of Satan: so Paphnutius an holy Confessour, would not himselfe, nor suffer Maximus Bishop of Ierusalem to tarry in the Councell assembled against Athanasius. Neither should any man thinke this strange; For we wonder not to see sheepe runne from wolues, or dogges, to their flockes, or not converse with swine: wel might we wonder to see doves sort themselues with kites or crowes. Christians are the sheepe of Christ (Iohn 10. 11.) his doves, (Cant. 6. 8. Isay 60. 8.) all men chuse their company either for likenesse of affection or for some pleasure, or profit which they either doe, or hope to receiue from such societie. But as Christians are new creatures, most contrary to other men, (these darkenesse, those light, Ephe. 5. 8.) so can they expect no pleasure or profit by seeing, or hearing God dishonoured, and their holy profession slandered. Remember the Apostles admonition,Ephe. 5.11.12 
                  Haue no fellowship with the unfruitfull workes of darkenesse, but reproue them rather: for it is a shame to speake of those things, which are done of them in secret.
               
               
                  
                  The Elect of God not onely shall be hereafter, but are already blessed.
               
               For as here the Prophet, so else-where our Saviour determines, that for the present they are blessed; even when they are under persecution,Mat. 5. 11. 
                  Blessed are you when men persecute you, &amp;c. Nay, without all question, if in this respect we compare them with other men, though it may seeme a paradoxe, it cannot be denied, that there is lesse distance betweene a Saint on earth, and the blessed estate
of Saints in heaven, then betweene the condition of wicked, and holy men even in this world.Eccle. 9.4. 
                  Better is a living dog, then a dead lyon; happier is the poorest Lazarus raised from the death of sinne, then the most stately Epicure who dead in sinnes, rots in the graue of his lusts. Who can deny, but that there is more difference betweene the dead and the living, then between the weake &amp; strong? Now the blessednesse of man consists in this especially, that he is partaker of the divine nature, and the life of God.
               
               As therefore the new-borne infant hath life as well as the best growne, so hath the faithfull, who is begotten of God, and borne anew, the true blessednesse, though he is short of perfection. True it is that to a carnall eye there is no such appearance; the fleshly and worldly man discernes no such thing: nay, he takes the godly man to be the most miserable on earth; and no marvell, for how should the lower nature reach up to the higher, and transcendent? How should a tree conceiue of sense, or a beast of reason? The naturall man therefore who perceiues not this spirituall estate, nor cannot conceiue aright of it, may easily applaud himselfe, and despise that which he knowes not: but the higher nature comprehending the inferiour, can rightly judge of both: man easily discernes betweene sense and reason, and knowes well which is to be preferd. Search all the world, and thou shalt never find a Saint,Heb. 11. 26. who prizes not the rebuke of Christ, before all the treasures of Egypt. And that we may better see this blessed estate of a true Christian, and with more thankfulnesse remember it, doe but consider a little his present condition; weigh together the evill yet pressing him, and the good comforting; Thou wilt say, he is full of sorrow and mourning, but, blessed are they that mourne: he feeles this godly sorrow to be such, as he repents not of it;Mat 5. 4. he knowes that it is better to goe to the house of mourning, then to the house of feasting.
                  Eccle. 7.4. Thou perhaps dislikest his condition, as being bound, and wained from earthly
and worldly delights and pleasures: but first he knows his liberty, in any lawfull use of the creature, and for abuse, in which the worldling hath set all his joy, he accounts, and indeed knowes it to be a deadly poison, a toad, a serpent, as venomous, as loathsome, and as much detesteth, as any can approue it. Thou wilt say; None are so obnoxious to injurie, to contempt, and despight of all men:Mat. 5. 11. 12. he knowes all these troubles to be as so many gemmes set in his crowne of glory.2 Cor. 4 17. Thou wilt adde, besides these outward fightings, how many terrors are there within: but he will tell thee, he is one of the Israell of God, and in all these wrastlings with men and Angels shall prevaile:Rom. 8. 38. so that nothing neither life, nor death, principalities, height, depth, things present, or to come shall separate him from the loue of God, which is in Christ Iesus our Lord. Put now in the other ballance those particular blessings which make up his happinesse here on earth: doe but goe along with him, while he leads thee through the pallace, or rather temple which God hath built within him. First, thou shalt see a little heaven in his understanding, wherein all those bright starres of the Apostles and Prophets shed their beames, nay, where Christ himselfe, that great Light and Sunne of the world is risen; looke into his heart, and thou shalt see a little paradise, planted with all choice, immortall, and heavenly fruit, and in the midst God himselfe walking; even a third heaven, where in the throng of Saintly thoughts God himselfe hath set his throne. Thou mayest (perhaps) see some battles against sinne, wrastlings with corruption, combates with principalities and powers, but with God a most sweet peace,Phil. 4.7. a peace which passeth all understanding.
                  Psal. 45. 13.
               
               In a word, thou shalt find him all glorious within, rich, and stored with much abundance and infinite wealth:1 Cor. 3.22. 
                  Whether it be Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come, all are his: nay, he that is all in all, God is his. The Father hath already

                  begotten him to himselfe: Christ is his head:Iames 1.18. the holy Ghost his comforter,Eph. 1. 13. 14. 22. and earnest of that glorious inheritance purchased for him: the Father so loved him, that he hath given him his onely beloved Sonne; the Sonne so honoured him, that he hath bestowed his life upon him, and parted with him his Kingdome: the holy Ghost so delighted in him, that he dwels in him, enlivens him, leads, sustaines, strengthens, and will never forsake him, till he is enthroned in heaven. No marveile therefore if blessed Augustine feared not to affirme;

He hath promised heaven, but given the Lord of heaven and earth; Certainely, he that ponders these good things which the faithfull already possesse, shall soone find them more weighty, then any evill which now they suffer.

And in every reasonable Agent, the end must be first in the mind, nay continually in the memory, if they will proceed orderly: common experience makes us see, that while we hunt for any thing upon a cold sent, (as they say) we are but coldly affected, but when we are in view, we follow eagerly.

But if it bee otherwise with thee, know surely, thou hast not yet set footing in this way of happinesse, but art miserable, poore, blind, and naked.
               
                  
                  
                     Reproofe.
                  Now here come under reproofe all such who giue any ungodly counsell, especially such as labour to withdraw any Christian, either from following those good motions, which are first cast into them by the Spirit, in hearing the word, or from the service, and first loue wherewith they haue entertained the Gospell, yet not all alike. For some from weakenesse, and unwarinesse, being holy men, are themselues ensnared by Satan, &amp; made his instruments to bring on others.
               Thus the brethren of Ioseph counselled, and encouraged one the other to murther.Gen. 37.19, 20. 
                  Iobs friends bent all their force to plucke away Iob from the fast hold he had laid on the Rocke by faith, never discovering the Devill at the end of the rope.Mat. 16.22. Thus did Peter when he heard that bitter reproofe, Goe behind me Satan: and againe when he was rebuked by Paul for that dissimulation, whereby many Iewes and Barnabas himselfe stept not with a right foot in the Gospell. These may justly be blamed for keeping no better watch over Satans enterprises, &amp; not more narrowly marking his fingers. Thus now many Saints are circumvented by him. To instance in some experienced example. I haue knowne a soule beaten downe by the word of God, and caused to see his sinne, full of feare and trouble, repaire to a faithfull Minister or Brother: opens his heart to them, and discovers his smarting wound: they being cunningly handled by Satan, begin to pittie his estate, and out of compassion think it a great sin to persecute him, whom God hath smitten, &amp; ad sorrow to such as he hath wounded. Hence setting aside the wine, which would indeed cause some smart, but purge the evill, they strait powre in the oyle of all spirituall
comfort, and so dresse the wound, that it is soon skinned, but after breakes forth with far more griefe, &amp; will aske much more time, and labour to heale. Whereas if they had first throughly searched, &amp; ransacked the sore with the knife of circumcision, and clensed it well with further reproofe, they might perhaps haue made the orifice wider, and the wound somewhat deeper, but much more soone, and soundly haue cured it. But if these deserue some reproofe, what rebuke can be whetted sharpe enough to rake those ulcerous soules, which being themselues full of dead flesh, infect, and corrupt others by their rotten stench, and putrefaction? How hellish is the condition of that man, whose heart is the māsion, whose mouth is the very shop of the Devill? where he forgeth those fiery darts, whereby he assaulteth the faithfull, and striketh through many a simple and unwarie soule. Lamentable is it to see, that many, who from faith, or feare to man detest to be traitors, and dare not perswade a subject from loyaltie to his Prince, yet without feare, or shame will employ all their wit, &amp; engines to withdraw a Christian from his allegeance and faithfull service to Christ. Many who will not a little scorn to be a Baud unto a man, will ambitiously pandare for the Devill. O let Baal plead for himself
                  
                     •
                   wilt thou entise a soule wedded, &amp; ready to be bedded with Christ, from his armes to the embraces of Mammon: &amp; dost thou not feare that jealous God, If jealousie be the rage of a man, what is this jealousie of God? but the divine indignation, wch will not spare in the day of vengeance?Pro. 6.34,35. 
                  he cānot beare the sight of any ransom, neither wil he rest contens, though thou givest many gifts.
               
               
                   Secondly, the fearefull Christian is to be rebuked, who by vaine terrors &amp; bug-beares is driven from his station: It hath beene an old Stratagem in war to set upon their beasts of carriage the Boyes &amp; Skuls, wch followed the Camp, and to place them in fit distance, so to distract the enemy, &amp; terrifie him with vain numbers. This was ever the slight of Satan, &amp; though it be his continuall practise,
yet men seldome obserue it. Hee sets before their eyes many scar-crowes, losse of some things esteemed good, and contrary evils; Thus he deales with the Israelites, and with the vaine shew of walled Cities, and Giants, makes them forget their Rocke,Num. 13.33. 34. and strong God of their salvation, and fall into open despaire and rebellion. Thus he deceived David himselfe, a most expert &amp; wise Captaine in those spirituall battels; after he had committed adulterie, he sets before his eyes shame, and losse of reputation, and with this idle shew driues him into two foule sinnes, first to make Vriah drunke, then to murther him. Thus he assaulted Moses with losse of treasures &amp; pleasures of AEgypt, the Kings anger, &amp;c. And thus frights he many in our times. To the covetous he suggests, what will you leaue the sweetnes of present gaine for future promises? a certainetie for an vncertaintie: o
                     •
                   a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush! With the drunkard he will plead; wilt thou change thy merrie companie for such a sowre, and joylesse life? with the beginning Christian; seest thou not all men generally goe another way? seest thou not how many reproches, what spight, what contempt will meete thee in the face? If thou takest that way never looke for good houre after all thy former credit and reputation is lost. How many silly soules hath he strooke with these affrightings, and drawen them head-long from their profession? But if we laugh at those that are scared with a vizard, how ridiculous to be amazed with such emptie shewes of evill? Awake, and open thine eyes, and see the vanitie of these scar-crowes. Thou loosest the pleasures of sinne, true; and is it not a pittifull thing for a swine to loose his tumbling in the mire? Thou loosest thy sinfull profits; and is this so woefull a matter, to loose a milstone off thy necke, when thou art now in a deep water? Thou loosest thy credit &amp; friends: no doubt a shrewd losse, to misse his good word, who is himself stark naught; to lose a cōpanion who will bring us to the gallowes: summe up thy losse, &amp;
thou shalt finde this is the totall; thou loosest death and hell, but what? dost thou get nothing by this losse? thou changest fading, and stinking pleasures, for the pleasu

                  gaine, and (as Deborah sings Iudg. 5. 19.) get no gaine of money.
               If you tell a true Christian that he hath a great losse in forsaking Father, Mother, &amp;c. he will but pitty thy ignorance,Marke 10. 29 30. when he hath already in possession an hundred fold gaine, beside the certaintie of an inheritance infinitely (beyond his owne thought) excellent.
               
                   Here may divers Christians take good occasion to chide and shame themselues in their own hearts: when they looke upon their sloathfulnesse in the harvest of Christ: Haue we felt the sweetnesse of Christ his yoke? Haue we shaken off those not more heavy, then loathsome chaines of Satan? doe wee feele the ease of this heavenly libertie? why then doe we not call on others, and invite them,Psal. 34.8. 
                  Tast, and see how gracious the Lord is? When Christ hath taken us by the hand why doe wee not catch hold on others, such especially as are neere us? when hee draweth us, why d

                   very cold to stocke them in grace, to bring them up in instruction of the Lord, fit and commend them to his service, who is not onely ready to accept them, but to giue them not a corruptible living, but eternall life, not a poore farme, but a rich inheritance, to instate them with himselfe in a Kingdome of glory? What is the cause that being a Husband, who from deare loue to thy wife, canst purhase her a joynter, whereby shee may liue comfortably when thou art dead, canst not draw on thy yoke-fellow to this partnership with Christ? Why is it that out of loue to thy brethren, allies, friends, and acquaintance in the flesh, thou canst cheerefully shew them all civill curtesies, ride, runne, sue, and worke out some good for them, mourne with them in their sorrow, rejoyce with them in their prosperitie, and yet thou on earth worse then Dives in hell,Luke 16. 27, 28. wilt never labour to prevent, that they come not to that place of eternall torment?
The truth is the cause of this spirituall carelesnesse is want of spiritual loue, and grace; Christian loue expresses it selfe in Christian duties, as naturall loue in civill offices: had'st thou so much as one graine of heavenly loue rooted in thy heart, it would spring, bud, and yeelde this true fruit of doing some good.
               It is a propertie of goodnesse to bee communicatiue of it selfe, which effect is as naturall to it as to fire to warme; therefore God being infinite Goodnes, and working infinitely, communicates himselfe even personally to his creature, namely, to the humanitie of Christ; and hath by him united all the Elect to himselfe,Iohn 17.21. to bee one with him through Christ. Thus is it with those children whom he hath begotten through the word of truth, in his owne likenesse;Iames 1. 18. they being partakers of his divine na

There is no signe then of grace in that heart which doth not pitty &amp; succour as it is able, the soules of their brethren, which are intangled in the snare of Satan.
               
               
                   Those are here deepely censured, who stop their cares against the warning of God, Come out from among them and separate your selues, saith the Lord:2 Cor. 6.17. as first, those wilfully blind soules, who (having devoted themselues to that whore of Rome) will not open their eyes to see her filthy nakednesse, so plainely discovered by God in his word.

Surely if Christ had not so painted out to us his Rivall, the Antichrist, almost in every limbe by that un-erring finger of his Spirit, or had not wee lived in those times,
when the accomplishment of those predictions hath given broad light to these misteries; did not that Man of sinne with a whorish and shameles forehead stand out to accept, and avouch those blasphemous titles, the Monarke, Spouse, and onely head of the universall Church, from whom it receiues even spirituall influence: did hee not make good the flatteries of his slaues, in receiving, and justifying the Papall Omnipotencie, challenging to be Vice-God, there might bee some shew of excuse in these blind wretches. But alas! what hope is there to pull them from the embraces of this spiritual strumpet, when they are so strangely bewitched with her painted face: that they make, and imagine the beames of the Sunne to borrow light from her eyes, even the Scriptures to receiue authoritie from the Church, and that the Pope only must giue the sense,Reu. 3. 18. which is the light of them? There is no other meanes but onely prayer to that incomprehensible light,Gen. 19. 16. that he would annoint their eyes with eye-salue, that they may see, and being mercifull unto them, would catch them by the hand, and lead them out of Sodome. So likewise halfe-Christians, halfe-Antichristians; some that would be Mediatours betwixt Christ and Antichrist, and bring them together to make them friends, which still are sicke of the dregges which they haue drunke in her cup of fornications. They put religion in superstitious abstinence from meates and drinkes

               And how many besides these, who haue not yet made any separation in judgement, will, affection, or practise from ungodly men, minding earthly things, despising the riches of Gods mercy, luke-warme, and key-cold, heartlesse to any good dutie, and even frozen in their dregs, whose mouthes are ever vomiting unsauorie and rotten speech, hands full of oppression, bribery and gifts, feete
swift to evill, having not so much as a shew of godlines, whose sinnes goe before into judgement? Nay, I would there were not too many, who having beside these outward warnings, inward checkes of conscience (shewing the scarres of former wounds received by wicked companie) and their experienced weakenesse, not able to stand out in tentation, calling to them to avoid these occasions, yet still linger and make no haste to get away. Hence it comes that they are first bruised with some open, &amp; shamefull fall, before they free themselues: but oh remember,Luke 14.26. if thou canst not hate father, mother, wife and children, brethren and sisters, credit, nay, living, and life for Christ, thou canst not bee his Disciple.
               
               
                   Those reputed Christians are heere condemned, and may iudge how farre they are from that estate they professe, and boast of, who finde no relish of happines in this separation, but rather delight themselues in worldly, and sinfull pleasures. As for that libertie of Christ, his easie and sweete yoake, they esteeme it a burden, and

                  ccount that strictnes of holy life, and waynednes from this world a discomfortable, &amp; ioyles condition. Hence is it that abusing Christian libertie unto fleshy license, they condemne, revile, and scoffe such, as will not runne with them to the same excesse of riot. This their behaviour openly proclaimes them Infidels, and those fooles which say in their hearts, there is no God. For a Christian beleeuer knowes that the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is libertie.

                   That bond therefore which drawes them neerest, and ties them fastest to the Lord Iesus, they account a most happy, and pleasant knot. And contrary the rebellious dispositions of their nature, yet cleaving to them, which as uneaven nooks, and corners suffer them not to lie so close to the foundation, they deadly hate, lament, and giue them vp to the hammer of Gods word to be hewen off; I cannot therefore but marveile which way these men goe about to make their hearts beleeve, that they are Christians;
Can they be ignorant that in the death, buriall, and resurrection of Christ, not some, but every member of Christ descended into his graue, and rose againe? Why do they, or how can they thinke that man a member of Christ, who was never conformable to his death, by dying to sinne? nor felt the power of his resurrection, through that quickning Spirit, renewing him in all holinesse, and righteousnes?Gal. 5.24. &amp; 6. 14. Every member of Christ is crucified to the world, and the world to him:
                  Col. 3. 1,2. They that are risen againe with Christ haue taken off their affections from earthly things, and removed them to their due place, even where Christ sits at the right hand of God,
                  Phil. 3.20. and as Citizens of the heavenly Ierusalem haue there their conversation. Traveling through this world, and wildernes to their Canaan, they use the world as not abusing it.
                  1 Cor. 7.31. Let these men therefore cast their counters againe; and consider well, how farre they are short of their account. Oh whosoever thou art, that goest vnder the name of a Christian, and yet shakest off that bond of strictnes, and power of Godlines, (which turneth the fountaine in the heart, and the streame of mens actions from this world toward heaven) despising such a course in thy selfe, deriding it in others, doe but a little, yet seriously, consider how base account thou makest of heaven, and much more of the Lord of heaven. Surely if a willing restraint from sinfull delights (as fooles esteeme, and call them) is a miserable estate, the heavenly Saints are more wretched then earthly men; and the God of heaven, blessed for ever, is of all most miserable, whose very essence, and nature doth necessarily free him from all sinfull inclinations: and know, that cannot be in the least degree miserable, which is in him in the highest degree, who is infinitely blessed.
               
                  
                  Consolation. Whosoever art hated in this world, separated, reviled, despised, and reiected of earthly men; whosoever art esteemd a strange creature, in that thou runnest not into the same excesse of riot with the wicked:
comfort thy selfe: Open thine eare, and let in that heavenly voyce, lay it up in thy heart, as a cordiall;Luke 6. 22,23 
                  Blessed are you when men hate, separate, and reproach you, and cast out your name for evill for Christ, and for the Gospell: rejoyce in that day, and leape for joy, for behold your reward is great in heaven.

And for quickning to this dutie,Ier. 15. 19. doe but consider, first the mischiefe which will inevitably follow, if thou walkest in the counsell of ungodly men.
               1. If thou goest with them in their wayes, thou shalt with them meete many annoiances:Pro. 13. 20. 
                  He that walketh with the wise shall be wise, but a companion of fooles shall bee afflicted: for (as it was with Balaam, when his way was not straight) the Angell of the Lord with a drawne swo

                     d comes forth to withstand thee: and will often meete thee, and if God giue leaue, cut thee off in the midst of thy journey.Psal. 34.16. Psal. 37.9. 38. 
                  The face of the Lord is against them that doe evill, to cut off their remembrance from the earth. Evill doers shall be cut off, transgressors shall bee destroyed together, and the end of the wicked shall be cut off. They liue not out halfe their dayes. Infinite examples wee see of this kinde in the Scriptures: and may daily by experience, if we obserue the workes of God, his fearefull and sudden 
                     •
                  udgements upon impenitent and godlesse persons: certaine
is it, thy conscience will resist, strike, and wound thee, and make thy course very troublesome and grievous.
               2. If thou walkest on with the wicked, thou shalt surely lodge in the same Inne, and sinke with them into everlasting destruction: so that if thou separatest not thy selfe from them, Christ will separate thee from himselfe, and from his flocke for ever. If thou departest not from them, thou shalt perish in their sinnes:Num. 16.26. if thou commest not out of Babylon, thou shalt partake of her
                  Reu. 18.4. 
                  plagues.
               
               Secondly, call to mind the great profit which will ensue upon this separation:Pro. 21. 16. 
                  God accepteth thee for his childe, and becomes presently a Father unto thee.2 Cor, 6. 17. 18. And this is the very summe of all happinesse, for how can hee want any good thing which enioyeth such a Father? Evill men can giue good things to their children:
                  Mat. 7. 11. what shall he deny to his, who is infinite Godnesse? Remember this, and stop thy eares: and consider thou hast enterteined a better Counseller,
                  Esay 9. 6. Esay 11.2. even the Spirit of counsell. Doe nothing without his advise. Say with thy selfe: The counsell of the world savours well to flesh and blood: But let me trie it, and see how it agrees with his advise, who is my best friend. Is there any Father like to my heavenly Father, any friend comparable to Christ Iesus? Is there any wisedome like 
                     •
                  hat of the Spirit of God? But they giue me other counsell; O therefore farre be it from me,Deut. 33. 9. to preferre Father, Mother, profit, pleasure, or any thing before the Lord Iesus. Nay in this respect, I will say to Father, and Mother, I haue not seene you, and to my brethren, I know you not: but I will obserue his word, and keepe his covenant. Now if thou desirest to know what course must be taken for effecting this separation: know first, it is the worke of God, for who hath separated thee?
                  1 Cor. 4. 7. and then remember, that God hath appointed his word to be his meanes for working it. It is Gods Minister, who by Gods word in his mouth, causes this separation.Ier. 15. 19. 
                  They take away the precious from the vile:
                  therefore so often compared to fire, which separateth the drosse from the purer mettall. Hearken therfore conscionably to the word of God, wait upon the posts of his doores, and he will giue the will and the deed.
               
               
                  
                     Proposition II.
                  The second point offered to us in this verse is,
                  
                     
                     Proposition
                     The Prophet pronounceth him blessed, who stands not in the way of sinners.
                  
                  To erre from the right way, especially in this darknes, or at least dimme light may befall any man, but to per
                     
                        •
                     ist in an evill way when it is discovered, is the part of a brutish, not reasonable creature: the Prophet therefore proceeds to that further degree and step of wickednesse, namely, wilfulnesse and obstinacie, after reproofe and conviction. Let us first cleere some of the words, that wee may goe on with more profit. Sinners; Certaine is it that all men are sinners, if we take the word in the largest sense:Rom. 3.23. Rom. 5.12. 
                     For all men haue sinned, and are deprived of the glory of God: sinne, and death the attendant of sinne have gone over all men: in which sense the most righteous man on earth may be called a sinner. But this word is often vsed in Scripture by specialtie, for notorious sinners,Esay 57.20. such, who sweltring &amp; boyling in sinfull lusts,Iude 13. fome out their own shame, in an open scumme of all filthinesse. In this sense Mary Magdalen before her conversion,Luke 7. 39
                           •
                        
                      was accounted a sinner:1 Sam. 15. 18. that is, one knowne, and commonly noted to goe on in grosse sinnes. Thus the Amalekits are called sinners. Such then are here called sinners,
                     1 King. 21.25 who liue in open &amp; notorious sinnes: as Achab who sold himselfe to worke wickednesse: who accustomed to sinne, follow it with greedinesse.,Eph. 4. 19.
                  
                  2 To stand, is such a position of the body, wherein it begins to settle it selfe to some rest: and therefore by a metaphor ordinarily in Scripture is taken for such a disposition of minde, whereby resisting all opposition, or
perswasion to the contrary, we resolue to maintaine the course we haue begun.1 Cor. 16.13. Thus is it taken in the good sense: Stand in the faith;Ephe. 6.11. 13.14. wher to stand is so to harden our selues in continuance of our holy profession, that we resolue to die, rather then to be removed by any tentation and assault of the enemie.
                  Lastly, the way argues also a perseverance, and proceeding in any course; That is, a way where no stoppage is, but a path continually trodden, and beaten by the passenger. Now evill wayes may be considered either in doctrine, (so heresie is called an evill way) or in manners, and conversation; so an habituall or customarie sin is an evill way. In all these words is expressed a further degree of sinne. A sinner in this sense is more then an ungodly man, the way more then counsell, standing more then walking. And every one of these words imply continuance, perseverance, and stubbornesse in evill. This then is the meaning of the words: Whosoever doth not rest in sinne, nor stubbornly persist in the rebellious course of notorious offenders, him the Prophet pronounceth blessed. No proofe shall need; the proposition being sufficiently evidenced in it selfe, and every converted sinner a strong witnesse for it. The grounds or reasons may bee first in God, his infinite grace, which opens a posterne vnto his favour, for those that unfainedly returne unto him, and forsake their evill wayes, hee covers See Ier. 3.1. 12,13,14. all their past rebellions, and imputeth not sinne unto them. Secondly,Ezek. 18.21, 
                           •
                        2, 23. in the Prophet, his knowledge of Gods goodnesse, as well by an outward and ordinary revelation in the word,Iob. 33.23. 24.26.27.28. as by an inward experience in himselfe. He had walked in some counsels of the ungodly,Psal. 119. 59. but yet considering his wayes, and turning his feete into the testimonies of his Lord; he found mercy and favour. The Prophet therefore first knowing,Psal. 32.1,2. 
                     blessed is the man whose wickednesse is forgiven, to whom the Lord imputeth no sinne. Secondly, being assured by an infallible and inward experience,Psa. 32.5.7 that when we hide not our iniquitie, but acknowledge and confesse our
sinn
                           •
                        , the Lord forgiveth the punishment, and compasseth such about with joyfull deliverance; upon these grounds builds this certaine truth, that the man is blessed, who although he haue walked in the counsell of the ungodly, yet being reproved, stands not in the way of sinners, but turnes his feet into the old and good way. Gather hence first these instructions.
                  
                     
                     Instruction 1. The heart of man (as it is in nature) is not onely prone to evill, but resolute in it: resisting all meanes of recalling, and hating to be reformed. See Psal. 50. 17. Rom. 2. 5. Men will harden their hearts, and make them as an Adamant, Zechar. 7. 12. and by no meanes will yeeld to God in his word. Some perhaps will object, wee may see many wicked men of better temper, then so: Thus Rehoboam obeyed the word of the Lord by the Prophet Semajah.
                     1 King. 12.22 24. Thus Amaziah hearkened to the voice of God, and sent away the Israelites: and Herod heard the word gladly,
                     2 Chron. 25. 7.
                           •
                        0. 
                     reverenced the Preacher of it, and did many things.
                     Mark. 6.20. But we must know that the action of God bending men to subjection, may be double: either by a common grace of restraint, or particular of the sanctifying Spirit. Thus the Lord workes in Heathens. I kept thee that thou should'st not sinne against mee:
                     Gen. 20.6. bowing them to some kind of yeelding to some parts of his will, for the good of the faithfull, peace of the Church, and other ends best knowne to his wisedome. Secondly, he plants obedience of faith in his children, and brings their wills, and affections under the yoke of Christ, creating in them a new heart, and conforming them to the divine nature. But when both of these are wanting, doe but obserue how men rush into all impietie, breaking thorow all lets, never regarding threatnings of the Law of God, promises of the Gospell, shame of men, their own future or present good, or hurt: no better then mad men, worse indeed then bruit beasts. Cōsider Pharaoh,

At length when affrighted with instant feare, death, and hor

                     God shewes the Iewes by a palpable demonstration, that they were in his hand as clay in the Potters they deny it not, hee cals them to repentance, and tels them a plague else was neere them: they speake desperatly,; surely wee will walke after our owne imaginations, and doe euery man after the stubbornesse of his wicked heart.
                     11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 18. The Prophet still followes them with admonition; they acknowledge him a Prophet, a Priest, a Wise-man: yet obstinately conspire against him, and against the word. Haue not wee such liue among us? Yes, thousands of swearers, drunkards, covetous, who stand out against God, his word, their owne conscience, their owne good and happines, and scorne all stoppage. Neither is there any meanes (without the power of God concurring and working with it) which can prevaile.Esay 1.5. Are they smitten? they fall away more and more:
                     Reu. 16.9. they breake out to blasphemie, but mend not. Are they kindly intreated, and waged with blessings? The fatter they grow the more they kicke. Deut. 32. 15.
                  
                      Seing man is not onely borne in sinne, but bred in iniquitie, there is now no way left him to come forth unto a blessed estate, but onely by the path of repentance, turning the heart to God, and becomming a new creature. See Luk. 
                     
                        •
                     3.3.5. Vnlesse you repent, you shall all likewise perish. All men naturally are going in the broad way to
destruction; All haue sinned, and are deprived of the glory of God.
                     Rom. 3.23. This broad way therefore must bee forsaken, and we must entet into that narrow tract, if we meane to attaine a blessed estate. Certainely as the Israelites could not enter into the Land of promise till those Rebels were consumed among them, so till these cursed affections which by continuall rebellion labour to vexe the Spirit, begin to die and drop away from us, we are not fit to enter into the Kingdome of God.
                     Luke 13. 3

                     Mat. 11. 21. Those Galileans whose bloud was mingled with their sacrifices, and those who perished by the fall of the tower in Siloam, were no greater sinners then others: hence that woe pronounced to those vnrepentant sinners.Mark .1.4. Hence our baptisme wherby we are entred into the Covenant of grace,Luke 3. 3. is called the baptisme of repentance:Acts 13. 24. and as Iohn the Baptist,
                     Mat. 3.2. so also Christ begins his sermons;Mark .1.15

                     The Kingdome of God is at hand, repent, and beleeue the Gospell. 
                     Gal. k. 15. Nothing is availeable to this end but the new creature, neither i
                        •

                     2 Cor. 5. 17. till we are newly created, and moulded. For repentance is that saving grace of God, whereby we are changed and become other men, altogether contrary to our former estate. The word of God is as a mould, in which the image of Christ is liuely graven by the finger of the Spirit,
                     2 Cor. 3. 18. into which when the holy Ghost hath cast us, we are transformed into the same fashion. Read, and consider well that similitude, where the Gospell is compared to a mirrour in which beholding the image of the Lord, we are transformed into the same likenesse.Ephe. 5.8. The first alteration is in the mind from darkenesse to light: Before so perverse in our judgement, that wee esteemed spirituall (even Gods) wisedome as folly,

                        6. 7. 14. but after this new birth, we discerne in this folly (for so foolish men count and call it) no lesse then a divine, and heavenly wisdome. The second change is in the will, &amp; affections: the same will, which h

                     Zech. 7. 11. now chuses, and rests in that object of faith which before it rejected. Mary hath chosen the best part.
                     Luke 10. 42.
                     The affections are from earthly changed into heavenly, honouring, and fervently loving, what they despised heretofore and hated.Rom. 8. 5. 
                     They who are fleshly savour the things of the flesh, but the spirituall man savours the things of the spirit.
                     Col. 3.1,2, 3. 
                     They who are risen with Christ, take off their affections from the world, and set them upon Christ. The last transformation is in the outward man, both in words, &amp; workes, see Ephe. 4. 22, 23, 24, 25, 28. the like read Colos. 3. 8, 9, 10, 12, 14. Man therefore by consenting to the Devill, and revolting from God, lost that divine image which was printed in him, but received a new Character of Satan, being wholy conformed to that Prince of darkenesse. But God in much mercy having compassion on men, and chusing them to his glory, hath set out his word as a fire,Ier. 23.29. and hammer to melt, and fashion them againe to that image which they left, and so restore them unto their former puritie and estate. Thus his word is his voyce crying o
                        •
                     t unto us, Stand in the wayes, and behold, and aske for the old way, which is the good way, and walke therein, and you shall find rest for your soules:Ier. 6. 16. againe he puts forth his power with his voyce:Rom. 1.16. whence the word is called his power to salvation: so that as in the creation he spoke the word, and it was done; his voyce being actiue and doing what is commaunded: so in this new creation, when he speakes the word, let there be light, let there be fruit, instantly light, and fruit insues: when therefore men hearkning unto this powerfull word, working salvation, are renewed in their mind, and walke in newnesse of life, they find no little rest and peace to their soules for the present, and are in the way to that eternall and glorious rest, in which consists the supreame perfection, and happinesse of man.
                  
                      Wilfull continuance, and stubborne perseverance in a sinfull course, after warning and admonition from God in his word,Luke 12. 47. 48. is a state much further from blessednesse, then grosse ignorance. He is lesse worthy of favour, who knows his Maisters will, and doth it not, then he that neither
doth, nor knowes it: rebellion is no better then witchcraft.1 Sam. 15.23 Those words (Acts 17. 30. that time of ignorance God regarded not) though they cannot be wrested to any connivence of God, as if he winked, and would not see those foule sinnes of the Heathen, yet cannot but import more danger to such as continue in this ignorance, when God hath su
                        •
                     ficiently revealed himselfe &amp; his will. Lesse excuse haue they, and much deeper condemnation,Ioh. 3.19. who when light appeared, loved darkenesse more then light, then such who ever sate in darkenes, and the shadow of death. The long-suffering of God manifests it self abundantly in bearing, &amp; forbearing, granting longer time, summoning by his workes, and warning them by his judgements, &amp; afflictions, but especially by his word, calling out to them and shewing their danger:Iob. 
                           •
                        3. 14. 
                     He speakes once or twice; hee whets his sword before he strikes,
                     Psal. 7.12,13. 
                     bends his bow and makes it ready, before he shootes out those swift arrowes; he cuts not off till there is no hope of healing, he spares till there is no remedy.
                     2 Chron 36. 16. But the more gracious he hath been in giving warnings, the lesse favourable is he in his judgments;Amos 3. 2. 
                     you only haue I knowne of all the people of the earth, therefore will I visite you for your iniquities.
                  
                  This certainely is the reason, why the Israelites before the comming of Christ, were often more sharpely visited with the rod, then any other Nation, their neighbours: &amp; after the comming of Christ, haue been made the publike spectacle of all the world for misery, because in the time of the Prophets, the Lord affoorded them many glorious beames of spirituall light, more then to all other people, and afterwards gaue in unto them that great Light of the world to walke openly before them. As their light therefore was more, so was their rebellion, as their rebellion, so their punishment.

Is it possible in reason, that any who hath not pluckt out his eyes, should thinke the Pope Christ his subject? nay, Deputie? who opposeth and exalteth himself aboue all that is called God? Doth he not challenge to be unto the Vniversall Church, an head to giue influence, a Monarch to giue Lawes, nay a Spouse, to giue and receiue benevolence: so that to be subject to the Pope is of necessitie to salvation: nay doth he not usurpe, and with all tyrannie maintaine a Monarchicall Omnipotencie? Surely that judgment mentioned by Tertullian is fallen upon them; They beleeve without Scriptures, that they may beleeve against Scriptures. We evidently see the Prophesie of the Apostle fulfilled in them,2 Thes. 2.10, 11,12.

Thus they use, &amp; defend in their Pope the title of chiefe or highest Priest, censured, and forbidden by the 3. Councell of Carthage: so also the worship of Angels is by them stiffely maintained, yet condemned plainly by the Apostle in the old heretickes, Colos. 2.18. and after by the Councell of Laodicea.

Two sorts may we find among this kind of people. One which more openly, other that more secretly oppose it. Of the one more grosse opposers, we read in the old Testament.Mica. 2. 6. 
                     Prophesie not, say they to them that prophesie, they shall not prophesie to them, that they shall not take shame.
                     Esay 30.9,10, 11. 
                     This is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not heare the Law of the Lord; which say unto Seers see not: and to the Prophets, prophesie not right things unto us: speake unto us smooth things, prophesie deceit?: Goe out of the way &amp;c. And the like we find in the new.Acts 4.18. &amp; 13. 45. &amp; 18. 6. 
                     They commaunded them not to speake at all, nor teach in the name of Iesus. But when the Iewes saw the multitudes they were silled with envie, and spake against those things, contradicting and blaspheming. Againe; they opposed and blasphemed. Such we see every where, corrupt men, sold under sin, and heardned in it: some drowned in a senselesse
ignorance, that neither doe, nor will know any necessitie of this light, and therefore wholy despising all prophecying. And to cover their shamefull Atheisme, they stand much upon prayer, and doe not a little magnifie it in word: But their words are wind: they doe as much despise prayer indeed, and as openly expresse the contempt of it in their actions as of preaching. Some againe of more knowledge will not deny the necessitie of it, as knowing it too shamefull to affirme there is no need of that, which Christ openly testifies to be the one needfull thing. Luk. 10.42. they will therefore come to it, perhaps frequent it, it may be pay for it: but then they must haue preachers acco

If he will spend an houre in the pulpit in vaine flourishes of humane wisedome, keepe off from their conscience, and two or three houres in the Ale-house, or Wine-Taverne, this is the good Church-man, nothing to deare for him. But if he be such as dares not please men,Gal. 1.10. least he be turned out of Christ his service; who would rather seeke their good, then their good will; if he bring home the rebuke of Christ to their hearts, labour to beat downe their rebellion, and draw them to the obedience of the Lord Iesus, they will not abide him, but devise an hundred slanderous discouragements, and use all even the most wicked meanes to stop his mouth. Many other are there, which not so openly resist the word, yet in some private and retired actions stand out in rebellion against the Lord.

Are we not naturally afraid of those who can kill the body? and where is the feare of him who can kill body and soule?

Clense thy heart from the leaven of maliciousnesse; purge thy tongue from railing, reviling, slandering, when wee are thus earnest with you, what fruit reape wee from all our labour? we speake in the ayre, we see these sinnes, and many other spring, grow, and flourish among you. Some very few haue their hearts opened, but most shut up their eares and hearts, least Christ knocking by his word should enter: and while wee mourne for them in secret, they openly laugh at us, while we pray for them, they mocke and flout us. But what will you doe in the end thereof? Know assuredly (and oh that he who hath the keyes of David would let this knowledge into thy heart) Thine owne wickednes shall correct thee, and thy turnings backe shall reproue thee.

Therfore Christ sends his Messengers, and his word, to open mens eyes, that they may turne from the power of Satan, vnto God, that they may receiue forgiuenesse of sinnes, and inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith.
                  
                     The Lord hath opened unto us a passage to returne to his grace by Christ, and to eternall happinesse. But some dejected soule will say, O I haue walked in the counsell of the ungodly, I haue not onely delighted in wicked companie, but all my life haue I spent in vanitie, and noisome lusts. I haue greedily followed the pleasures of youth, and haue not with-held from mine eyes whatsoever they haue desired: when my pleasures grew loathsome, then with as much violence I pursued the world, and the covetous desires of it; and all my care and delight was here on earth to plant, build, and purchase for my selfe an earthly convenience. As for those fruits of the Spirit, that house made without hands, eternall in the heavens, the inheritance of the Saints in light, I seldome dreamed of it, but neglected the gracious offers of God.

But alas I feele a world of sinful filthines still dwelling, &amp; rebelling in me, now more then ever. Know this is rather a symptome of health, then sicknes. Thou feelest sinne more now, not because it, but because thy health, and sense of Spirit increases: diseases in their strength dead the senses, so that little paine is felt, but when life prevailes, and begins to expell the sicke matter, our paine with our sense returnes.
                  Know assuredly, he that hath dethroned sinne raigning in thee, can easily subdue sinne fighting against thee.

graue them upon our hearts:Dan. 6 24. so finishing our iniquitie, we seale up our sinnes, and by these deeds of darkenesse settle our soules in much securitie, in this miserable purchase. Like dead men we lie downe in our lusts, and (as some great persons) proud of our rottenesse, with much cost and ostentation build up our sepulchers of this body of death, compose our selues in our grau
                        •
                     s, and set up our rest in them. Here therefore the Prophet layes down the lowest degree of sinne (even that which is next to hell) and in avoiding it, the least degree of happinesse. So then in this third proposition;
                  
                     
                     
                        Proposition
                     
                     David pronounceth that man blessed who sits not in the seat or chaire of scorners.
                  
                  For some opening of these words, consider what is here meant by sitting, what by a seat or chaire, lastly who are scorners. A seat or chaire (as wee know) properly taken, is some frame of wood, or other matter purposely made for the resting of the body; and by Metonymie (because Princes &amp; Iudges had thrones and chaires of state, where the people being assembled, and standing about them received judgement: see Psal. 122. 5. and Exod. 18. 13.) hence a seat is taken for precedencie, power, &amp; authoritie. Thus the seat of Moses is used for his power, and authoritie in the word,Mat. 23. 2. which God committing first to Moses, derived to all his successours: so the Throne or seat of David for that temporall preced
                        •
                     ncie and power whereby he governed and judged that people. So likewise sitting, being a position of the body composed to rest, is by Metonymie used for exercise of authoritie and power.Revel. 18. 7. 
                     I sit as Queene. The Lord saith to my Lord, sit at my right hand:Psal. 101. 1. and by a Metaphor being lent from the body to the soule, may signifie either to rest in sinne, or to use a Lordly power, or freedome to follow it. Thus wee read of a Lord of anger, a Lord of appetite, (for so is the word, Prov. 22. 34. and 23. 2.) so then to sit in the seat, may intend, both that securitie of wicked men, whereby they sleepe in sinne, and resolue to rest in it,
and also for that lifting vp, and pride, shaking off the yoak of Christ, iudging, and p

                     osecuting the good, and Godly. Lastly scorning is an action of men, wherey they thinke, and speake basely of any thing, and from contempt, rising out of pride, reiect it
                        •
                      A scorner therefore every where in Scripture, is taken for such a sinner, who being flesht in all wickednesse, fild, and puft with pride, and vaine conceit of his owne wit, despiseth the wisedome of God in the word, and makes a jest of sinne, the reprover, and reproofe of it, see Pro. 1. 22. and 14.9. when men conceive well of their owne wayes, and are bladderd vp with a windie opinion of wisedome in themselues, then they basely esteeme of other counsell, mocke, and deride whatsoever comes crosse of their owne praejudging conceits. The sence then of this proposition is. Although thou hast sorted thy selfe with worldlings, and hast beene misled in their vngodly courses, although after many reproofs, thou hast neglected the grace which was offered; and hast now long continued in thy folly, even despising in thy carnall conceit the wisedome of God in his word, yet if thou now returnest, leanest not still to thine owne wit, but yeeldest vp thy selfe to the yoke of Christ, thou art heere already, and shalt be must more heereafter happy, and blessed.
                  
                  To witnes this truth (beside many other) the whole 15. chap. of S. Lukes Gospell may be fitly cited: where in those parables, especially that of the Prodigal (spending, rioting, never returning, till by extreme miserie he was scourged home, yet then graciously receiued, entertained with a feast, and clothed with the best robe) our Saviour a
                        •
                     firms much ioy to be in heaven for one sinner, that converteth. Even scorners are called to repentance, and grace offered; and the Prophet invites, and cals to such,Pro. 1. 22. 
                     Be no more mockers least your bonds increase.
                     Esay 28.22. And it is more then probable, that some of those who mocked the Apostles as if they had beene overtaken with wine,Acts 2.13. 41. were not onely called by the word, but throughly recalled, and pricked in their hearts, baptised and saved.
                  
                  
                     The grounds and reasons of this (as the former) proposition may be. 1. In God, his infinite and unutterable mercie, taking no delight in the death of the sinner, but calling to returne, and ready to receiue.Esay. 55.7. 
                     Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him returne unto the Lord, and he will haue mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. 2. In David, who had both by the word, and no question by experience, seene this worke of Gods mercie in many notorious sinners.
                  
                     
                        Instruction.
                     Gather hence these instructions.  1. There are divers degrees of sinnes and sinners, many steppes and staires in the descent of death; some lower then other, and neerer to the gates of hell. Some transgresse of ignorance, some of knowledge; sinnes of knowledge are some of infirmitie, not without strugling, some of presumption: nay even these of presumption, some of them not committed without feare or remorse, with purpose of amēdment; some with an high hand, as in defiance of God, and open contempt of his justice. There are many respects which aggravate sinnes, and make them either more or lesse odious. The sinne of an eminent person more scandalous and hainous, and therfore not onely punishments but (which is not to be read with neglect) sacrifices of greater price set out for them.Levit. 4. 3.22. 23

                           •
                        28. Levit. 21.9. Sinnes of ignorance in a Priest were propitiated with a yong Bullocke, the same sinne in a Ruler reconciled with a male goat, in other with a female. A Priests daughter if shee play the whore must be burnt with fire. So the excellencie of the person offended aggravates the offence; reviling the Prince, more then railing at a subject; blaspheming God, worse then slandering man. Many circumstances there are wch lessen a trespasse, or increase it; whence our Saviour more deeply censures the Iewes then Pilate, they Gods people, he an heathen; they from outrage, and furious malice, with threats, and tumult driue him against his judgment, to corrupt judgement, and abuse the Ordinance of God,
                     even his justice; but he desirous to content the people, fearefull to incurre Caesars displeasure,Iohn 19. 11. labouring to saue the innocent, was at length overcome by their importunitie and clamours, therefore had they the greater sin. Verily the justice of God, proportioning a greater measure of damnation to some, then others, necessarily argues the sinnes of men to be of divers size and measure. The sinne of Bethsaida, Capernaum, Chorazin, more intollerable then those of Tyre, Sidon, Sodome or Gomorra.
                  
                  Sinnes and sinners may well be resembled to diseases, and diseased bodies. Every disease as it more distempers the body, and disturbs that just proportion, and mixture of humours convenient, and agreeable to nature, so is it more grievous: some so strong, that they catch, and infect; &amp; the bodies infected sonoysome, that they spread their poyson, and even dart

                  Obserue it in some particulars; When Satan had kindled in the heart of Cain that hellish brand of
anger, it could not be quenched with the neerenesse of bloud, and deere relation of an onely Brother, till anger had enflamed it with hatred, and hatred broke out into actuall murder. So in Sodome fulnesse of bread, or luxury breedes idlenesse, idlenesse lust, and lust rushes into that bestiall filthinesse against nature. And would to God some remnants of this cursed disposition remained not still in the faithfull; howsoever it be over-mastered by his Spirit dwelling in them, and raigning for Christ. When David gaue his eyes leaue to wander in wanton lookes, his eyes draw his heart to wanton thoughts and desires, and his heart driues on his body to actuall uncleannesse. Thus was he carried headlong to adultery: adultery puls him on (under pretence of saving his credit) to make Vriah drunke, and at length to murder him. Consider this with feare, and not onely know the falsenesse and cunning deceiveablenes of the heart, but remember that when men even Gods chosen giue way to sinne, God often suffers them to be carried down in the current of it, that before they can thinke of it, they are almost sunke, and swallowed in death and despaire.
                  
                      There is that vnmeasurable pride in the heart of man that it will with no great difficultie be brought to mock God in his word, in his works, in his Saints. For as God is denied, so is he derided, eyther in word, and open profession of Atheism, or more secretly, in rebellious actions, proceeding from inward contempt of God. As there are some which haue denied God in words, through feare, and weakenes, which yet confessed him in their heart:Tit. 1.16. so are there many who professing God in their words, deny him in workes, being altogether abominable, disobedient, and to every good worke reprobate. Neither are these Atheists to be found among Heathens onely,Pro. 1. 25. 29. but every where swarme in the visible Church of God. How often doth the wisedome of God complaine of, and threatens the despisers of his word?Ier. 20 7.8. &amp; 17. 15. How often doe the Prophets cry out of them? I am in derision daily; every one mocketh me, the word of God
was made a reproach to me, and a derision daily:
                     2 Pet. 3.3. see the manner of their skosting.Iude 18. 
                     They say unto me, where is the word of the Lord? let it come now. Thus Ezekiell chap. 33. 32. So likewise God is mocked in his workes by those Atheists, which being foretold by the Apostles, wee see daily walking after their lusts. Numberles are they that mocke God in his Saints; see Psal. 14. 6. and 69. 7. 9. 11. 12. It might seeme a strange and marveilous thing, that even those who professe Christ should mocke him: should mocke him in his word, and despise his wisedome in those ordinances which himselfe appointed, and commended to his Church: unlesse the Spirit had shewed us the cause of it; namely,1 Cor. 2. 14. 
                     the naturall man discernes not the things of God, but judges them folly: now we know that folly is the most proper object of scorne. And many hipocrites are in the visible Church, who haue Lord often in their mouthes, yet never in their hearts; but are in deed, howsoever in shew they seeme otherwise, naturall, sensuall and divellish. Doe but obserue the ordinarie behaviour of men in this open light; how common is it for men to absent themselues from the publike service of God in the Sabboth, never blushing in plaine termes to prefer their owne vaine conceits before the ordinances of God? affirming and maintaining, that they can serue God as well at home, and in the chimney corner, by reading some good booke, &amp;c. as in the Church by hearing the Preacher? And so wilfully blind are they, that they cannot see how basely in this they esteeme of Gods wisedome, who continually employes his servants, and commands them to be instant: the wisedome of God sends them Prophets, Apostles, wise men, &amp;c.
                     Mat. 23. 34. If God send them dare wee thinke it needlesse? were hee not more then fond, who would send a Guide with a man, who without any direction can as well come to his journeyes end? How ordinary is it to draw neere to God in his word, to set before him, yet openly by sleeping, reading, nay many times talking, proclaim
                        •
                      the contempt and scorne in which
they hold that Ordinance, the power of God to salvation? This behaviour were intollerable toward men, yet God must take it at our hand.Mal. 1.8. Offer such service to thy Prince, and try whether he will be content with it, and accept thy person? If he commaund thee to attend his pleasure at the Court; and sets thee a day, darest thou breake day with him? darest thou refuse? and answer, that thou canst doe him as good service at home? If thy father be in conference with thee, direct thee how to assure to thy selfe and thy posteritie thy inheritance, were it not an impudent contempt in the meane time to stand prating with some servant, or lye downe and sleepe?
                  How palpable then is our base conceit of God, and his words, that when we heare his Wisedome affirming, blessed are they that heare me, &amp; wait upon the posts of my doors,Pro. 8. 34. Get thee forth (if thou wouldest finde me) by the steppes of the flocks,
                     Cant. 1.7.8. 
                     and feed thy kids by the tents of the shepheards;Heb. 10,25. warnes us not to forsake the Assemblies, dare reply againe, I shall doe as well at home in mine owne house, as in his Courts, I shall as soone finde him in my private walkes, as among the flockes and shepheards. The cause of this contempt questionlesse is, that soveraigntie, and dominion of lust in the heart, which swayeth the whole man, yea even rides him, as with a snaffle, turning him from the way it liketh not, and driving him as with a spur, to any action, though never so unreasonable. This the Apostle intimates,2 Pet. 3 3. where he giues a generall cause of this action in scornfull men; namely, their following of lusts: &amp; more particularly those worldly lusts of covetousnesse are most strong this way to draw the heart unto this despising of the word.Luke 16. 14. 
                     All this heard the Pharises, who were covetous, and they mocked him. Thus those mockers Ez

                      Howsoever it pleaseth the Lord sometimes even out of the chaire of scorning, to bring some home to his own dominion (so to manifest the power of his word, and the wonders of his grace) yet certainly such are farthest off
from his kingdome, and in a more remote distance from happinesse, then other degrees of sinners. For in some kindes it is not with sinfull dispositions, as with these postures of the body: the body which walkes, neither stands, nor sits; the body which stands, neither sits, nor walkes; and that which sits, neither walkes, nor stands: but that soule which stands in the way of sinners, walks in the counsell of the ungodly, and hee which sits with scorners, both walkes and stands with sinners. For as a reasonable creature includes and comprehends both vegetation and sense, and as higher degrees of holines containe the lower: so in sin, he that sit
                           •
                        
                      in the seate of mockers, in the same instant walkes in the counsell of the ungodly, and stands also in the way of sinners. Mocking of Gods Messengers, and despising the word is expressed by God to be the last and lowest degree of sinne in his people, immediately going before destruction. 2 Chron. 36. 16. scorners are an abomination to men:
                     Pro. 24.9. therefore Sarah could not indure mocking Ismael to stay in her house with her son, Gen. 21.9.10. How much more detestable are they in those most pure eyes of God, and shall be thrust out of his house? A fearefull curse God pronounceth upon any child that shall mocke his Father in the flesh, or despiseth his Mothers instruction;Pro. 30.17. 
                     the ravens of the valley shall picke out his eyes. Surely then that soule which mocketh his Creatour, and despiseth the instruction of the heavenly Ierusalem, that fowle of the ayre, who pickes up that good seed, shall devoure it.
                  
                     
                     
                        Examinatiō.
                     Try here thy wayes, see and consider how far thou hast proceeded in the paths of death: hast thou hearkned to the counsell of the ungodly? hast thou stood with sinners? so that after conviction and checks of conscience thou hast still gone further, and sate downe among the despisers and mockers? Thou art even at the pits brinke, there is but a step betwixt death and thee, and if thou dost not quickly draw backe thy foote, thou wilt soone fall into a bottomlesse perdition.
                  
                     Now because every one flatters himselfe, and drawes out his name from this number, remember (as before was shewed) that God is mocked in his workes,Pro. 17. 5. in his word, in his Saints. For even he that mocketh the poore, reprocheth his Maker; and all these kinds of mocking are either inward by despising (see Prov. 1. 22. 24. 25. thus Michal despised David in her heart;2. Sam. 6.16.) or outward, partly by word injesting, flouting, scornfull speaking (thus Elisha was mocked,2 Kings 2. 23. 
                     come up thou bald head, come up thou bald head) or by actions and gestures, as Christ was derided by the Souldiers, they cloth him with purple, they crowne him with thornes, they bend the knee &amp;c. Now then consider thy wayes. The Lord in the Sabbath calls thee to remembrance of that great worke, the creation of thee, and all the world, &amp; that greater, of thy redemption by Christ: hast thou not here sate with scorners? For hast thou neither in thy heart lightly esteem'd, nor in thy words jested, nor in thy actions slighted this solemne day? and so scorned that great work of God offering grace unto thee in his Ordinances? How many must confesse themselues guiltie of this sinne? For the word; when thou hast heard it sometime threatning, sometime promising, hast thou not set it at thy heeles? hast thou neither in thought, word, or action sleighted it? When thou hast conversed with the Saints, hast thou not despised that holy fellowship, and skoffed like profane Ismael? Common and ordinary is this abuse, and too few who can exempt themselues from this sinne. Looke therfore about thee, and quickly retire thy se

scorning, and is but the last degree of it) is a state, not onely dangerous, but desperate, see Heb. 6. 6. and 10. 25. 26. 27.

                     The poore which walketh in his uprightnes, is a better man then the rich which peruerteth his way, yet will not men beleeve it. For the better man ought to haue more respect: we finde it by experience too true: that friends, and Brethren reiect th

                     The sinner despiseth his neighbour, but he that hath mercy on the poore is blessed, where despising and shewing mercy being opposed by God, teacheth us, that when wee withdraw our hand from doing them good, or oppresse them then we despise them: and this despising is not onely, sinfull, but rises from grosse, customary sin: so that when we are hardned in rebellion, then we proceed to despise the poore, and God in him: But oh, thou vaine man, thou proud earth, art not thou the same clay of the same potter? and who hath separated thee? who makes rich, and
poore. How presumest thou to despise the worke of God, being thy selfe the worke of his hands? Looke to thy beginning and ending, and spie out (if thou canst) any difference betwixt thee and the poorest. Art thou not servant to the same Lord, wearest thou not the same livery of skin and flesh? dost thou not sleepe in the same dust and nakednesse? wast thou borne with lands, treasure, or scepters in thy hand? what difference in the graue betweene thy mace and his mattocke? Oh if thou hast so much light, looke a little into thy heart, and see there a farre more miserable and desperate povertie. How poore is thy understanding in spirituall light, and treasures of knowledge? how poore thy heart in bowels of mercie? how needie art thou in faith, loue, and those heavenly riches? Thou which art beggerly in the true, canst thou despise the want of Luke 16.11. 
                     wicked riches? Hast thou not received all from God? Art thou not his debtour? why boastest thou of thy debts? of that, of which thou art onely a Steward, and accountable to thy Master? Certainly as that earth which is replenished with precious mettals, is altogether in the superficies barren and unfruitfull, so is it with

                     a Camell shall as soone be drawne through the eye of a needle, as those men into the Kingdome of God. Boldly I dare a

                     firme it, that he hath never felt his inward miserie, who despiseth outward povertie.
                  Againe consider how contemptuously other workes of God are used by most men; for to omit many; that worke of his mercy in having patience with us, and forbearing us, how is it despised, how scornfully abused? May we not say to thousands with the Apostle,Rom. 2.4. 
                     thou despisest the riches of his bountifulnesse, and patience, and long-suffering: doe we not see with our eyes the complaint of Salomon verified among us?Eccle. 8.11. 
                     because sentence against an
evill worke is not speedily executed, therefore the heart of men is fully set in them to doe evill. Nay certainely so profane is the heart and so full of cursed Atheisme, that when the Lord holds his tongue,
                     Psal. 50 20. 
                     men begin to thinke that God is like to themselues. But surely in nothing more palpably appeares our contempt of God in his workes then in the open, wilfull, &amp; even despitefull breach of the Sabbath, so often, and n

Againe it selfe is one of those workes of God, which especially manifesteth his grace towards us, and is one of his loue-tokens, in that he hath set out this day as a signe, a working and e

                     Ezek. 20.12. who sanctifies us to himselfe. Besides in setting downe that precept, he hath particularly hedged in our transgressing nature, provoking us by many strong motiues to obserue it

                      laying forth meanes to helpe us, tying a threed of remembrance about our hearts, that wee might bee wholy without excuse, so that whosoever with care reads it, he cannot but see, that the Lord more presseth that commandement, and inforceth it upon our conscience then all the rest, as being the meanes whereby hee writeth all the rest in our hearts. Doe but now behold the practise of men (and not to mention the Papists, who holding not the head Christ Iesus) regard not his day, but abuse it, &amp; maintain the abuse to any journey, or other affaires, but deifying the Saints, most superstitiously obserue dayes by the Pope dedicated to their service:) l
                        •
                     t us look unto our selues. Are not Ministers charged, nay fearfully adjured to preach the word, to be instant in season, &amp; out of season:
                     2 Tim. 4. 1. 2. yet how many despise the very season of sowing that precious and immortall seede? As great a charge is given to the people for hearing, and as great, and more is their neglect and contempt, openly proclaimed
by them, as well by their spending some of those few houres of Gods publike worshippe in their owne workes, abroad in the field, or at home in their beds, by their fires &amp;c. as also by an impudent avouching and defending their sinne; scorning all reproofe, and deriding the reprover, Nay even some that are called and reputed honest men, and boast themselues to bee good keepers of their Church, make no conscience to mispend the rest of the Sabboth, in any vaine, or idle employment, taking liberty to dash out any instruction they haue received with ordinary, nay many times unlawfull, and at any time sinfull recreations.
                  Whence can this behaviour proceede, but from a notorious contempt of God? from a grounded Atheism and wilfull unbeliefe of heart? And what? Art thou indeed stronger then God?
                     Ier. 7.19. 
                     Dost thou provoke him to anger, and dost thou not provoke thy selfe to confusion of face? Oh! know and remember God is not mocked, and when hee denounceth so frequently unto thee for this sinne destruction of body and soule, he See Esay 29 20. mockes thee not. Thine owne reason will teach thee; as thou sowest, so shalt thou reape: if thou sowest the wind, thou shalt reape the whirlwinde, if thou sowest contempt, thou shalt reape derision:Pro. 3.34. 
                     with the scorner hee scorneth.
                  
                  2. Mocking God in his Saints must here bee reproved,  the most common sinne of this Age. Everie abject scornes Christ in his members, and indeede despiseth not so much the person, as holinesse in the person. Holinesse without all question is that Attribute of God in which he most excells, and delights, the very beautie of the Lord. Here wee admire his power, grace, mercy, but in heaven the Saints and glorious Angels beholding his face, are ravished with that beautie of his holinesse, and in their prayse, double this propertie, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of
Hosts: In man it is the very image,Esay 6.2.
                     Rev 4.8. (when hee is begotten unto God as his child through the immortall seed of his word) hee doth resemble his heavenly Father: which therefore the Lord commaunds us to follow, and to labour for it,Levit. 11 44. 45. and sets downe the penaltie of our neglect,1 Pet. 1.15.16 
                     wee shall never see his face;Heb. 12 
                           •
                        4. but shall bee banished from his presence. It is the very end why God hath chosen us,Ephe. 1.4. &amp; 5. 26.27. why Christ hath given himselfe for us; yea the effect of his bloud, the especiall worke of Gods Spirit dwelling in us.2 Pet. 1. 4. In a word it is the very nature of God communicated to us. There is no sinne therefore which more evidently exalts it selfe against Christ, none that reacheth so high toward heaven in defiance of God, as this, when men despise in heart this image and nature of God, and in despitefull termes and gestures publish themselues the scornefull enemies of holinesse.
                  How common this divellish profanenesse is, may easily bee seene; first in fastning the odious name of Sectaries and Heretickes upon those which desire and endeavour to flie the corruption which is in the world through lust, and in truth of heart to follow after righteousnesse: for if a man with feare and trembling striues to eschew evill, and doe good, and hath set up his resolution to walke godlily, righteously, and soberly in this present world; how soone is hee branded by worldly and wicked men with the name of a Puritane? Which being ancient Heretikes, sheltring their ranke and stinking sinnes under that abuse of Scripture, To the pure all things are pure: pretended themselues to be cleane, pure, and holy in the practise of all filthinesse. Nay, they are not afraid (if they discerne in any more shewes of godlinesse then ordinary) to deride him, by applying to him that title, which is the most honourable, that
belongs to a Christian, as, This is one of the holy Brotherhood, one of the holy Sisters: Surely if they think them not such, and speake ironically, accounting them hipocrites of whome they thus speake, (for thus they excuse themselves) then are they most vnexcusable, who dare abuse to mockery the greatest honour, that ever God vouchsafed the creature: to be a Brother, and heire with Christ, and to apply a name appropriate to Gods Saints unto such, as they esteeme no better then whited tombes, and painted sepulchers. And because folly is the especiall object of contempt, they are come to that height of bold Atheisme, that they will impudently terme such Gods fooles. But as the Apostle affirmes the folly of God to be farre aboue the wisedome of men: so these fooles (as they call them) of God, are farre aboue these worldly wise Achitophels, who with all their policie can never escape, nay by it runne into destruction and perdition of body and soule. That these should be Christians, who mocke Christianitie, that these should bee children of God, who scoffe at the Brotherhood of Christ, let them beleeue who can; for my selfe I cannot see how the greatest charitie (which is alwayes joyned with wisedome) can otherwise account of these men, then of most wretched Infidels, filled with contempt of Christ, and hellish Atheisme: well therefore may we pray against their wickednesse;Psal. 31.18. 
                     let the lying lips be made dumbe, which speake grievous things proudly, &amp; contemptuously against the righteous.
                     Psal. 79.4.12. 
                     We are a reproach to our neighbours: a scorne and derision to those that are round about us: Render seven fold into their bosome the reproch, wherewith they haue reproched thee O Lord.
                  
                  
                      Those that despise the word of God, and him in this his Ordinance, are here evidently condemned. Let such know it is impossible to separate the despising of the meanest in Gods Ministrie, from the contempt of Christ, and God his Father,Luke 10.16. 
                     he that despiseth you despiseth me, and
he that despiseth mee, despiseth him that sent mee: where Christ in generall speaketh of all Ministers, whom hee employeth in the glad tydings of salvation, and particularly of such as were not Apostles, but the seventie Disciples, who (if we consider them at that time) in the knowledge of Christian mysteries of faith were farre inferiour to the most ordinary Professours at this day. In vaine therefore shall men plead before the tribunall of Christ; Lord when did we heare thee preaching unto us, and scorned thy word? for he will, nay hath already answered, he that heareth whom I send, heareth me: and therefore what you haue done to the lowest of these my messengers, you haue done unto mee. Moreover there is nothing more certaine then this judgement of God, that hee will mock

                  And herein the Romish Church manifesteth her whordome, in that shee hath, and still doth make a mocke of that most holy word of Christ. Surely that which Pope Leo 10. spoke, the rest of that Hierarchie thinke, and are not dainty to expresse their thoughts in their actions, who blasphemously boasted, that the fable, or tale of Christ had brought them no small advantage. Evidently in those two actions doe they discover themselues what they thinke of Religion.
                  
                     1. That they turne the whole streame of it into the bottomlesse gulfe of their covetousnesse and ambition, &amp; frame it wholy to earthly ends, accepting no doctrine, nor allowing it as good, which tends not to the advancement of the Clergie, and either directly, or by some fetching about, brings them in profit or honour. This cannot but appeare to any man, who doth not winke, or lookes not through Iesuiticall spectacles.
                     
                        2. In that they equall such humane writings with the divine, in which shines no sparke of divine light, but are branded with manifest untruths and impossibilities, and ascribe such workes to the holy Ghost, wherein the Authour protests his end of writing,2 Macab. 15. 2 last verses. to delight the eare of the reader, nay desires to be excused for slender and bare speaking.

               Psalme I. Ver. 2. But his delight is in the Law of the Lord, and in his Law doth he meditate day and night.
               
                  THE Prophet having in the former verse layd downe the way which must bee declined by all those which would come to happinesse; in this, propounds positiuely the path which without faile wil bring us to it, if we follow it to the end. In this way he sets out two periods: 1. delighting in Gods Law; 2. meditating in it day &amp; night: from which issue two points of doctrine.
               
                  
                     
                     
                        Proposition
                     1. The Prophet affirmes him blessed, who delights in the law of God.
                  
                  2. The Psalmist pronounceth him blessed, who meditates day and night in the law of the Lord.
                  
               
               In the former these particulars must bee opened
                     •
                   1. what is the law of the Lord: 2. what this delight in the law. The law is sometime strictly taken for the first scriptures, the fiue books of Moses: and then ordinarily distinguished, either from the writer, and called the Law of Moses;Luke 2. 22. &amp; 16. 16. &amp; 24. 44. or by adding the other opposite member, the law and the Prophets: sometime it is more largely extended, as comprehending all the propheticall writings of the old Testament: as is manifest Iohn 10. 34. where
the booke of Psalmes is made part of the Law.
               
               But the word here used properly signifieth doctrine, yet is generally and rightly translated Law, because whatsoever God would haue us know concerning his will and pleasure, is there by himselfe taught, revealed, and promulgated, Deut. 29.29. so that he appointeth it the only ordinary meanes of life. Luke 16. 29, 30, 31. 2. because all doctrines delivered in the word, are so many sanctions of the supreame Majestie, binding the conscience to all obedience, and perfect subjection. Againe his delight is by some translated his will, the word signifying that action of the mind, whereby willingly, pleasingly, and with loue the heart cleaues to any thing: so used Gen. 34. 19.
               This then is the meaning of the words; Whosoever loues the Law, or word of God, cleaues to it, takes pleasure in that which God there cōmandeth: he is entred already into a blessed estate. This as it is here plainly testified, so also the Apostle addes his suffrage unto it, evidently affirming that as his misery consisteth in being vexed with the body of death, resisting the law of God:
                  Rom. 7. 22. so his happinesse in delighting in that law concerning the inward man.
               
               The grounds or reasons of this testimonie in David are, 1. his knowledge in the word of God,
                  Psal. 119. 50. 92, 93. whence hee had taken forth this lesson
                     •
                   
                  Deut. 28. 2. his experience, having felt by this delight an unspeakable happinesse, being holden up in his deepest afflictions, and quickened from his deadnesse by this word. Hence gather these lessons.
               
                  
                  
                     Instruction.
                  The Scripture containeth all that doctrine, which is profitable to the perfection of a Christian, so farre as to make him wise to salvation, and to bring him to everlasting happinesse. For if he be blessed,Psal. 19. 7
                        •
                     
                   who with delight entertaines it;2 Tim. 3.15. 16. 17. necessarily it must containe whatsoever is necessary, or profitable to that end. Thus else-where he pronounceth it perfect. And the Apostle speaking of the Scriptures, affirmeth them able to make wise to salvatiō, &amp;
profitable to instruct, &amp;c. so farre, that the man of God may be perfect in every good worke. And hence is it, that when God by Moses had written this law, and delivered it to the people he straitly charg

                  m to adde nothing to it, nor take any thing from it,

And without all question, howsoever it pleased the Lord of his goodnesse by the succeeding Prophets to expound and open the law, and farther to presse and inforce it, yet did never any Prophet adde any new doctrine to the former: words they add
                     •
                  d to cleare and unfold it, but no new matter or precept to the duties cō
                  manded. Thus after did the Apostles,Acts 26
                        •
                     22. as witnesseth that chosen Vessell, they said no other things, then those which Moses and the Prophets did say should come. Certainly as in the creation of the bodily light, the Lord made &amp; spread over the world a generall brightnesse: which after he gathered into one body (the Sunne) and made it as a fountaine, from whose beames not onely other creatures, but the heavenly lights themselues should borrow all their splendour, even the Moone and starres. So having in this little world of man created a spirituall light of wisdome and knowledge in his understanding, diffused and spread it over mankind, and for some ages of the world derived both by traditiō, (as we may more then probably gather) from one to another: but especially to the Patriarchs, by inspiration and gift of Prophecie: But in processe of time when he had called out a Nation, &amp; sanctified them to himselfe to be his Church and people, he contracted this spirituall light into the body of the Scripture, and appointed not onely the people in his Chu
                     •
                  ch, but even the Starres, the Ministers to take from it what they brought to us, and to shine with no other beames to the people, then which they drew from the word. Hence the Prophet recals the people to this fountaine of light,Esay. 8.20. 
                  to the law, to the testimonie, if they speake not according to this word, it is because there is no light
                        •
                      in them. Hence so often called Light: and the Apostle (as before) witnesseth
that the Minister is made wise to salvation, and perfect to every good worke by it. As therefore the Creatour framed one great originall light, to rule the day, so that by the beames of it the creature might haue power to discerne all things necessarie to be seene: so to this end he calleth the Scripture light, because he hath given it a lightsome qualitie, whereby it discovers unto us whatsoever is necessary to eternall life; and it might direct and instruct us in every good way and worke: for surely words are to the eare the same, that light is to the eye; the eye by light discerneth things visible, and distinguisheth every creature which it seeth: so the word of man opens his intention to us, which else lieth hidden in his heart; and is altogether imperceptible.
               Thus the word of God doth manifest unto us the will and purpose of God, and cleerely reveales to all and every one, what is necessary for them to know; as being all plaine to them that will understand.
                  Pro. 8.9. Now then seeing God cannot dissemble, and it were blasphemie to affirme that he who hath given us Christ, would giue us an obscure light, which should make us doubtfull in seeing; and should utter words to discover his minde, which wee cannot understand; (this he doth in judgment to the reprobate, but he deales not so with his children: see Mar. 4. 11. 12.) How lewdly doth he thinke of God, who should affirme, that he giues to his children a word, cals it light, commaunds them so to use it, and continually to converse with it, which yet is darke, and imperfect, and may easily deceiue them.
               
                   2. The word, whether that which God hath written downe for our eyes, by the hands of his Secretaries, or that, which he speaketh to our 
                     •
                  ares, by the mouth of his Messengers, is the very law, doctrine, and word of that great Iehova, the Lord of all, and therefore so to be received, with more reverence, and subjection, then any word or law of any creature. The first of these is evidently affirmed here, namely that this doctrine is the law of
the Lord: the second necessarily deducted, that therfore it must bee received with all submission and obedience, which becomes us servants to so great a Lord. Neither can this doctrine be confined to the Scriptures onely, seing God doth not onely by writing, but by preaching teach us the way to happinesse,2 Tim. 3. 16. 
                  2 Pet. 1.21. and lead us in it. Hence is it, that as the Scriptures are sayd to be inspired of God, and by the moving of the holy Ghost,
                  Luke 10.16. so our Saviour without any ambiguitie plainely testifies, that he speakes, and is heard in his Ministers. Flesh and bloud stands out against this truth, and by no meanes will yeeld to it, that the Ministers who now liue, speake the very word of God, and that the word which they heare, is indeed not mans but Gods. The Prophets (say they) and Apostles were extraordinary men, and furnished with peculiar gifts for such a calling, and with an unerring spirit: therfore their word was infallibly God
                        •
                     
                   message, and so to be received: but not so the Ministers of our times, who haue not the same gifts, but may erre, and be deceived. True it is, that the Prophets and Apostles were (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ) so infallibly assisted by the Spirit, that they could not erre in their preaching; and therefore their word without skanning might be safely received by those who knew them to be such. But because even the faithfull themselues did not at the first thus know them: therefore they examined their preaching by the touch-stone of the Scripture.
               
                  Paul was a singular Apostle in doctrine, and miracles, &amp;c. yet did not the faithfull take his word at adventure, but tryed it by the Scripture, and then gaue credit to it. Acts 17. 11. Nay certainly had even these men (though knowne Apostles) preached other doctrine,Gal. 1.8. then was revealed in the written word, it might not be received. And therefore though the Ministers of these times, are nothing comparable to them in gifts, yet being Messengers of the same God, sent by him, when they speake the same doctrine, which was before by them published, and after
left in writing, they speake no lesse the word of God, then they: unlesse we thinke the qualitie of man can alter the truth of God. When Satan spoke,Luke 4.34. 
                  Thou art the holy one of God, was it not the truth? When Balaam a false Prophet, over-ruled by God, prophecied, was not the prophecietrue, because the tongue was false, and might, nay often did speake lies? How much more is that word to be received as the truth of God, which being spoken by his Messengers, is no other then himselfe hath written? In the time of the Law, as there were some extraordinary Ministers, (as Prophets) so were there ordinary Teachers (the Levites) who expounded the Law, &amp; instructed the people: and dare any man deny their preaching to be the word of God? So was it likewise in the times of the Apostles. They ordained Ministers in every congregation, and was not their word the embassage of God? Epaphras no Apostle, and (as farre as wee can gather) no inspired Preacher, yet planted the Church of the Colossians;Col. 
                        •
                     .5. and the word preached by him was the word of Christ, the Gospell, the word of truth. To conclude this point; Hence the word delivered by Timothy, an inferiour Minister, was equally the word of God, as if it had beene uttered by the Apostle: see 1 Thes. 2. 13. Nay it must be remembred, that those words of our Saviour,Luke 10. 16. 
                  he that heareth you, heareth me, and he that despiseth you, despiseth me, were not spoken to the Apostles, but to the seventie Disciples; and then, when as yet the holy Ghost was not given; nay, when as yet the Apostles themselues were altogether unacquainted with the chiefe mysteries of salvation, even the death and resurrection of Christ. But if any man reply, that he cannot giue so assured assent unto the word now preached, as to that of the Apostles, let him know the fault is in himselfe not in the word,Gal. 1.8. and Ordinance of God: for he ought to be so stedfastly grounded in the truth,Ephe. 4.1
                        •
                     . that if Angels from heaven should preach otherwise, he should bee able to distinguish, and accurse it: know therefore Pastors and

                  Teachers are as well given by Christ to his Church, as Apostles and Evangelists: both are his Messengers, and these speake no lesse the word of God, then the other; so farre as they mingle not their own inventions, but keep themselues to their commission, and instructions delivered to them in the packet of the Scripture. How therefore this word is to be received; with what reverence, and subject obedience, judge thy selfe, and consider the example of Cornelius (see Acts 10. 33.) nay even of that Heathen King, who rose up from his Throne,Iudg. 3.20. to receiue a message sent from God, but delivered by a subject.
               
                   3. The Law or word of God is full of sweetnesse, and pleasure: containing in it whatsoever may giue content or joy to the heart of man; This truth evidently appeares in this place, seeing delight in it is here required of all those which shall be blessed; The experience of Gods Saints, and their profession approues it;Psal. 19.8.10. &amp; 119. 103. 111. 
                  They rejoyce in heart: Sweeter then the hony or the hony combe: They are the joy of our hearts.Ier. 15. 16. The words of truth are pleasant words.
                  Eccle. 12.10. Hence the Church of Christ affirmes the mouth of Christ to be as sweet things.
                  Cant. 5. 16. And the reason is evident: For as nothing is more grievous to the nature of man then dark
                     •
                  nesse, imprisonment, death; so nothing more cheerefull then the contrary, light, liberty, and life.Psal. 198. and 119.105.130. Now the word of God is the very light of our eyes, not onely as the bodily light, which is but a (medium) or meane of seeing
                     •
                   but first opening the eye, and giving it inward light, and then as a meane, and outward light, revealing other things to us. So is it also called the meanes of libertie, as well discovering unto us our naturall bondage, and sla
                     •
                  very, and how we are freed by Christ, as also bringing us out of the chaines of Satan, into the libertie of Gods child
                     •
                  en. Hence it is called the Law of libertie.
                  Iam. 1
                        •
                     25. and 2. 12. So Christ is sent to preach libertie to the captiues.
               
               
                  Luke 4.18.Certainely the word of God is to the soule of man as the Angell to Peter;Acts 12. It findes him in prison, bound with
divers chaines, in a deepe sleepe, in a darke Dungeon; but it wakes him, stirres him vp, shakes off his bonds, brings him out, opens the iron gate, and leaues him not till he is come to himselfe, and feeles he is delivered by Christ. Nay it is his life, by which (being dead in sinnes and trespasses by nature) he is quickned, and raised up not to a corruptible, but eternall and glorious life. Therefore is it called our life, that is,Deut. 32.47. the meanes which God hath appointed as well to giue us life,1 Pet. 1.23. &amp; 2.2. as here to continue it: therefore compared to seede and foode: Looke then as light is a pleasant thing, and it is a good thing to the eyes to see the Sunne,
                  Eccle. 11.7. so much more the soule, which hath beene long held in miserable blindnesse and darkenesse, cannot but rejoyce in the word, which brings him that true light. As a man being held in fetters, and restraint, is in a new world when he enjoyes his libertie: so likewise that captiue soule, which hath long beene bound, and held fast by Satan in those heavie chaines of sinne, is wonderfully ravished with the joyfull message of that glorious libertie. Or as a man dying, and ready to drop into the graue, is not a little revived with the promise of a skilfull Physitian, assuring him life: so the soule that is now drawing neere to the gates of Hell, and almost swallowed up in eternall death, how is hee refreshed with the glad tydings of Salvation? Therefore in all the historie of the Apostles travels, and publishing the Gospell, we shall ever finde that this word preached fild the Cities, houses, and hearts of men with rejoycing and gladnesse: see Act. 8. 8.39. and 13.48. and 16. 34. And indeed as Corne, Wine, and such creatures were purposely created by God to strengthen, and cheere up the body of man: and by his ordinance, not of themselues, haue this power &amp; force to worke to that end to which he ordained them: so this food of the soule is that creature appointed by God, to fill the soule with gladnes &amp; strength to life eternall, and therefore shall not misse of this end, where God employeth it. Even in
earthly affaires, heavinesse in the heart of man doth bring it downe, but a good word reioyceth it:
                  Pro. 12.25. how much more true is this of the word of God? If that friendly word of Boaz fill'd the heart of Ruth with comfort and joy, that being a stranger,Ruth .2. and having forsaken her friends and Country, she found new friends, good words and usage in a forraine place; how much more must the cordials of that great Comforter in his word cheering our hearts, and assuring us, that though we haue forgotten our owne people, and our fathers house, yet of strangers and forreiners we are entred into the household of God, and haue found the Lord Iesus so sure and fast a friend to our soules, how much more joy and cheerfulnesse will this put into us? How doe coole waters refresh a wearie Pilgrime toiled in dust and travaile?Pro. 25 25. so is glad newes from a farre Countrey. Surely when the soule hath wearied it selfe, and found nothing; when it is tired in the travaile, dust, and sweate of the world, and hath found all to be vanitie and vexation of spirit: how welcome are those waters of life, flowing from the Sanctuary? how ravishing those glad tydings of p
                     •
                  ace sent downe from heaven by the Lord Iesus Christ, and brought home to 
                     •
                  his heart by the blessed Spirit in the ministerie of the Gospell, which is the power of God to salvation.
               
                   4. It is not onely the dutie of such who desire happinesse, to exercise their senses in the word of God, but to doe it with delight; that their hearts should stand so affected to the word as to their refreshing and pleasure: for here is the feast of fat things,
                  Esay 25.6. 
                  which the Lord maketh for all nations, and therefore inviteth to come cheerefully unto it, being free and costing us nothing:Esay 55.1.2. and willeth us to delight our soules in fatnesse:
                  Esay 58.13. 14. verily the promise of delighting our selues in the Lord is confined to that dutie of delighting in these duties. And indeed this delight being nothing else, but that willingnesse of minde pleasing it selfe in this action, infinite passages shall we finde in the scripture bending this way, and exhorting us to embrace
the word with this willing cheerefulnesse.Iames 1.19. 
                  Bee swift to heare. Be more ready to heare, &amp;c.
                  Eccle. 4. 17. And the practise of the Saints is evident to this end, as was before proved. Reason will further enforce this affection upon us; for 1. It is an Ordinance of God purposely set out by him for this end, even to solace the heart, and fill it with true joy and comfort, as was before shewed: and hence is it, that there is no estate of man which may not there find what soever is comfortable and usefull. 2. Even heathen wise men acknowledged that in wisedome there were admirable pleasures, and could perceive, and professe him to be the wisest &amp; happiest, who was (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ) the most godly wise. 3. Especially the very object of delight being goodnes, hence the wil is necessitated to take pleasure in it. It proceeds from God the infinite good
                     •
                   it is in its kind infinitly good, therfore called the good word of God:
                  Heb. 6 5. the end &amp; effect of it to lead us to our supream good &amp; happines. But is it not the savour of death? No otherwise then Christ is a rocke of stumbling, not in it selfe, but by the perversnesse of man. Nay rather this argueth the goodnesse of it; because as a thing is more good, so the abuse of it is more dangerous. In a word; whatsoever goodnesse is in any creature, whereby the bodily sense and life is refreshed, all this in a farre more excellent manner, and measure is comprised in the word. The fleshly eye is ravished with beautifull colours, and corporall fairenesse, but the understanding is that eye of the soule to which truth is the most proper and pleasing object:Rom. 10.15. and therefore the feete beautifull that bring it. The eare is pleased with sweete words, and 
                     •
                  loquent speeches;Eccle. 12. 10. but how pleasant to a spirituall eare is this upright writing, the words of truth? The tast is delighted with sweet meats; but the word is hony, and 
                        •
                     he hony combe to the mouth of the soule. How delightfull is gaine and profit to a worldly heart? But this word is the curr
                     •
                  nt coyne of that heavenly Kingdome, which stocketh the heart with the treasures of grace, and bringeth us to those full riches, and inheritance
of glory. It is therefore our dutie to draw our averse hearts to delight in it, and not onely necessarily, but joyfully to converse with it.
               
                  
                  
                     Examinatiō.
                  Try here and proue thy selfe whether thou art yet entred into this way of happinesse. See here the happy or blessed man delighteth in the law of God: as well the word it selfe, as the way set him downe in that word is pleasant and delightfull. Obserue therefore the worke &amp; wisedome of our Creator, and thou shalt find that as he hath allotted to the creatures severall beings and natures; so hath he filled every nature with severall affections &amp; dispositions. Among the sensible some take their pastime in the ayre, some in the water, nay some within the earth. In the vegetatiue we see some trees, and herbs delight and thriue in waterie and marish grounds, other in dry and rockie; some in hot, and others in cold; some in a fat, others in a barren soile. Thus in the food and nourishment of sensible bodies what a strange difference doe we see? That is pleasant and wholsome to one which to another is loathsome and a deadly poyson. Thus hath that all-wise Creatour disposed, that there shall be a kind of aptnesse, and affection in one creature to sustaine and beare up the nature of another. Now as he hath given to the creatures severall natures, and fitted them with severall nourishments answearable to their constitutions; so also hath he so tempered their complexions, that they are necessarily, and strongly carried by their appetite to desire those things, whereby their nature is sustained and comforted: applying their tast to delight in those nourishments. Thus in thy bodily life he hath given bread and wine for thy sustenance, and so ordained, that by his blessing there is in this food a power of increasing, and strengthning the body, and in the body a necessary and earnest desire of these aliments, and in the tast a pleasure to receiue them. Thus now is it with thy soule. If thou art entred into this new life;Iohn 6. 51. 
                  Christ Iesus is that bread which came downe from heaven, the bread and water of
life, the true vine, which cheeres up thy soule: hee is brought home to thee in his word, which word God hath purposely given to be the meanes of spirituall life, and hath put into it his power to salvation: therefore as he hath given to the spirituall man an unseparable appetite to hunger and thirst after it; so likewise hath he given a spirituall tast, to which this good and wholesome word is as hony and the hony combe, so that they are not a little delighted and pleased with it. If therefore thou canst finde in thee this spirituall tast, constantly delighting in the word; it is a sure note of life.
               But had not Herod, and haue not temporary beleevers a tast, yea a delighting tast in the word? Yes: but 1. not constantly; no not in the promise. 3. The delight which they haue, is not indeed in the word, but in their owne conceits falsly drawne from it: as remission of sinnes at all adventure; mercy and grace without any true change or repentance, and such like; yea even then many things of Gods law they spit out as bitter and unsavory. But the true Beleever hath this tast in him constantly, though sometimes dulled by tentation; and rejoyceth not onely in those sweet promises which nourish him, but even in those bitter reproofes; as in sowre, but wholesome salets, provoking to appetite, and clensing the stomacke. So likewise all the wayes of heauenly wisedome pointed out to him are wayes of pleasure. The way of godlinesse, righteousnesse, sobrietie are all delightfull. This is not so with the wicked man, who may please himselfe (or at least seeme so) in some of these: but hath no heart to many necessary duties, nay utterly d
                     •
                  tests and abhors them. The most civill man will take much libertie not onely in omission of pious duties, as of prayer in his closet and familie, breach of some part of the Sabboth, but 
                     •
                  steems it a light matter to breake out into commission of some ungodlines, as oaths so they be not frequent, nor of the greater size in his measure: but especially in shaping a religion, and worship of God after his owne fancie, neglecting,
nay even despising the rule of God, at least precisenesse of that rule. The hypocrite will gild over his out-side with a faire resemblance of pietie to God, and the eye must be very sharpe to spie out a fault in the outward forme of his profession, but is far from that seeming care of righteousnesse, and just dealing with men, but that we may easily discerne grosse neglect of such duties. But he that delighteth in the Law of God cannot be thus disposed. But as he loues the Lord for himselfe, and delights his soule in rendring to God that which is his: so doth he loue his brother for God, and will carefully obserue his respects unto him.
               
                  
                  
                     Refut.
                  3. Seing the Lord giues this name of Law to the Scripture, hence is just occasion to refute that blasphemous errour of Poperie, that the written word is not a perfect rule or direction. But 1. God in evident termes contradicts it;Psal. 19.7. 
                  The Law of the Lord is perfect. 2. By many necessary arguments it may be proved: for that is perfect to which nothing may be added, or from it detracted: and thus is it with the Scripture. Deut. 4.2. and 12. 32. Prov. 30.6. Rev. 22. 18. 19. And very idle is the cavill of the Papists, who affirme that the Prophets and Apostles added many things: But first for the Prophets, it is cleere that they added no new doctrine (as was said before) but in their prophecies largely expounded, &amp; further enforced the duties before cōmanded: &amp; not the most prying

                     apist is able to shew any new doctrine in any Prophet which before by Moses was not delivered. The Apostles disclaime all addition: as before we saw Act. 26.22. Againe that wch is able to make wise to salvation through faith, that is a perfect rule &amp; doctrine; such is the Scripture. Nay that which is inspired by God to this end, that the man of God even every faithfull Minister, may be made perfect in his office, to instruct, refute, exhort, &amp;c. that surely is a perfect rule; but such is the Scripture: see 2 Tim. 3

Surely though the Lord hath appointed Ministers as lesser lights, and left some glimmering traditions, to cleare some darker poynts; yet he is wilfully blind, that will not confesse the Scripture to be that great, and set light, from whose beames all other receiue their lustre: so that whatsoever shines not with this light, is but as rotten wood, glaring in

                  1. Those are here reproved, who in practise of religion will either adde to this Law, or diminish: for many will put religion in many things, which haue no warrant from this Law: and other (as farre wide on the other hand) will take libertie to detract from it, making no conscience of duties there commanded.

So also they make light account of many precepts, insomuch that they place among their veniall sins, divers grievous and enormous transgressions of the Law, as well against God, as man; affirming that
they need no repentance, but are taken off by sprinkling holy water, the Bishops blessing, &amp; saying a Pater noster, although the person mindeth not what he sayes; Thus it seemes that with them, one grosse sinne may take away another. But this offence is common also among many other ignorant people, who are ever learning, and never come to the knowledge of the truth. Thus some put all their religion into their good meaning: some place it in the outward and formall performance of some duties: Many savoring strongly of the old leaven, imagine they doe not a little please God in abstaining from some meates in the time of Lent. They will serue God at home when they should be employed in his publike service, by reading some good booke, and saying some good prayers in their chimney corner, nay even in the place and season of hearing, they will be reading, and so plucke down that curse on their heads;Pro. 28.9.

Thus also in

                  inite numbers of people deny him in their workes: utterly refusing to square their life &amp; practice according to this rule of Gods word, whereby the Lord is manifestly denied. For when they confesse with their tongues, that it is Gods will, y
                     •
                  t resolue in their hearts to doe their own; their practice is as an hundred tongues to proclaime their deniall of God. Certainly the ground of this disobedience and rebellion, is grosse infidelitie, even a resolute unbeliefe of Scripture.Iohn 5.46.47 
                  Had the Iewes beleeved Moses, then would they also haue beleeved Christ. But if they beleeved not his writings, they could not beleeve Christ his preaching: how truely may we apply this sentence of our Saviour to this unbeleeving generation? Had you beleeved Christ, you would haue beleeved us; for he spok
                     •
                   of us, and hath told you: He that heareth you, heareth me. But if you beleeve not his writing, how should you beleeve our preaching? If you despise his word in his hand, you will easily scorn it in our mouthes.
               
                  And indeed this unbeliefe is more apparent, because the more men urge and presse the Scripture on the conscience, and practise of men, (observing the rule of his Spirit in preaching to edification, and labouring to beat downe whatsoever exalts it selfe against Christ, that everie thought may be subjected to his Scepter) the lesse credit estimation, and good opinion they gaine among men: the lesse their doctrine and persons regarded. But if neglecting the evidence of the Spirit, they sticke their sermons full of Rhetoricall flowers, and witty conceits of men: if they come in ostentation of much reading, stored with the citations of Poets, Rabbies, Schoolemen, and with the sentences of ancient Doctors (of whom there is no doubt, very good and much profitable use in their season) the more they goe on in this course, where the conscience is not stirr'd, (as being altogether loose from man) the more are they admired, reputed, and followed. Oh this word of God is sharpe, a two-edged, deepe-cutting sword, whose downe-right blowes cleaue the heart of our sinfull nature; when those vaine flourishes never moue us: hence it is feared, and hated by those who liue in sinne, and resolue to rest in the forme of godlinesse. Therefore that most fearefull judgement fals often upon them;Hos. 4. 9.

                  Cause the holy One of Israell to cease from us: and the Lord justly giues them up to the doctrines of men, and vaine flourishes of humane wisedome. In a word as they wish, so they receiue from God (in his just judgement) Ministers, not after Gods, but their owne hearts, that they who haue no pleasure in the truth may beleeve lies, and vanities,
                  2 Thes. 2. 10. 11. and putting from them the power of Gods salvation, may sinke in their owne perdition.
               
                  3. Those are here sharpely to be rebuked, who haue no relish in the word of God, no
                     •
                   finde any sweetnesse in it. The complaint of the Prophet is now verified in many, who make no question but they are Christians good enough.Ier. 6.10. 
                  They haue uncircumcised eares, they cannot heare; the word os the Lord is unto them as a reproach: they haue no delight in it. How woefull is their estate, if they had any sense to apprehend it? and how much more woefull, that they haue no feeling of this their woefull miserie? That man is farre spent, who being diseased cannot abide either good physike, or wholesome meat, but wholy delights in such a diet, as is prescribed him by his distemper: and how neere is that soule to hell, who loathing all remedie, cannot tast any thing which should doe it good, but longs for all sinfull matter, whereby it is every houre made riper for hell. Certainely where the conscience cannot but confesse a life to come, how fearefull is this condition, which evidently shewes the soule to be dead unto that life, dead in sinnes and trespasses? for what life can be in any creature, which desires not (and that necessarily) the meanes whereby this life is maintained, thriues, and prospers? what affection of life, where we delight not in that which preserues it? Now were this death (as in the death of beasts) the deprivation onely of life, and so a perpetuall sleepe without dreams, a senselesnesse without any either pleasure or trouble, it were the lesse miserable. But when the heart knowes that after this life so short, there succeeds another, which is endlesse, where both soule and body againe united shall continue for ever, either in a most joyfull glory, or an hellish torment, no hope of change? how miserable is this estate, which testifieth to our face, that we haue no signe of this life, but are marked to that endlesse and fearefull perdition?
               
                  
                  
                     Consolat.
                  Now how soveraign a cordiall is this doctrine to those who can truely apply it to their owne soules? If thou find
                     •
                  st thy heart take pleasure in this word, &amp; thou canst
say as the Prophet (and as he, truely say) Thy word was found by me, and I did eate it; and it was the joy and rejoycing of my heart,
                  Ier. 15. 16. thou shalt finde the same comfort which is there given to that Saint; and assure thy selfe that God will make good to thee, what here he promiseth: Thou shalt be blessed. Surely even then when thy disquiet soule, working in thee, boiles in griefe, and vexation to see that law of thy members rebelling against the Spirit; and so strongly opposing, that thou canst not do the good thing which thou wouldest, then this delight in the law concerning the inward man, will be a soveraigne comfort to thy afflicted spirit; so that thou wilt be able (with peace) to say,Rom. 7.20. 
                  It is not I, but sinne that dwells in me: neither shall it be imputed to me, but to the enemie prevailing against me.
               
                  
                  
                     Exhortation
                  Suffer then the words of exhortation, and labour for this delight in the law of God: Striue with thy dead heart to bring it to this dutie, that thou mayest take pleasure in pleasing thy Lord. And to quicken thee in it consider seriously the equitie of it. Can there be a more easie command then this? namely to delight in thine owne good and happines? Now there is nothing in the word of God but that wch wholy tends this way:Cant. 5.16. nothing in the yoke of Christ, but that which is sweet and easie. Remember how sweet the mouth of Christ is to those, who haue beene acquainted with his word, and exercised in it.
               But what meanes should we use to worke our soules unto this delight in the word of God.
               
               1. Thou must purge thy tast from delight in sin: when wickednesse is sweet in thy mouth, and thou hidest it under thy tongue, when thou favourest it, and wilt not forsake it, thou canst not possibly favour the word of God.
               
               2. Thou must earnestly intreat the Lord to open thine eyes, that thou maiest see thy estate, how naked, blind, poore and miserable thou art in nature, that so thou mayest haue more sense how necessary this Ordinance of God is, and how wretched thou art without it. Be instant therefore
with the Lord to giue thee this hunger and thirst: This will make that reproofe which to flesh and bloud is most bitter, sweet and pleasant: for the person that is full, despiseth the hony combe: but to the hungry soule every bitter thing is sweete.

                     Proposition 2.
                  Now follows the second proposition arising from this verse, namely;
                  
                     
                     
                        Proposition
                     
                     The Psalmist pronounceth him blessed, who day and night meditateth in the word of God.
                  
                  Where is no need to expound many words: for some are cleere enough of themselues, and othersome haue before beene sufficiently explained. Here onely consider what is this meditation; and how that phrase day and night (expressing the continuance of this duty) is to bee understood.
                  This word meditation implies a vehement motion of the minde, breaking forth into action. The best Interpreter even the holy Ghost thus explaines this word in another place.Ioshua 1.8. 
                     Let not this booke of the law depart out of thy mouth, but meditate therein day and night: that thou mayest obserue and doe according to all that is written therein. Where we see the nature of meditation rightly unfolded; consisting 1. in observation, that includes diligent attending, marking, and remembring; 2. in practising: so what he there particulary commends to Ioshua, he inforceth other where generally upon all: Deut. 6. 3, 4, 5 6
                        •
                      7. &amp;c. where we are commanded to get these words by heart, to teach them others, continually to thinke of them, that we may bring our hearts to the loue of God.
                  
                  2. Night and day is a phrase of speech, implying not onely frequencie, but such a continuance, as (though it be not without some intermissiō, yet) is without negligence
carefully, and cheerefully performed in the season of it. Some haue thought that night signifies the time of affliction and trouble, day the time of our prosperitie, and gladnesse: and no doubt but darkenesse is in Scripture often taken for grievance, and trouble; light for solace and comfort. No question also, but it is our dutie in the evill day, and in all our rejoycing to meditate in this word: but seeing the former is not onely the genuine, or naturall interpretation of the words, but also includes the latter; by night and day must here bee understood a continuall revolving of the will of God, sometime in hearing it when the season giues leaue, sometime reading it, frequently recollecting it in our memorie, and without intermission expressing it in all our actions and constant practise. Thus then runne the words: Whosoever with a fervent and zealous heart giues up himselfe to the word of God, to heare, read, thinke of it to practice and doe it: and that not by starts, but in a continuall course of life and conversation: this man is already blessed, and shall at length attaine to perfect happinesse.

                     Luke 11. 28. 
                     He that looketh in the perfect law of libertie, &amp; continueth therin,
                     Iames 1.25. 
                     not being a forgetfull hearer, but a doer of the worke shall be blessed in his deed.
                  
                  The grounds or reasons may be, 1. in the nature of the word .2. in God ordering it, and working with it.
                  First therefore as God hath given to every creature a certaine nature, wherby it is fitted for any worke or end, and hath in it selfe a power to worke unto that end: (as to light to discover,Rom. 1. 16. and present things to the eye; to feed, to produce the like unto it selfe) so hath he made this word to be his Ordinance,Ier. 9.23.24. which shall worke powerfully unto salvation. And as he hath ordained that our perfection and happinesse shall consist in the knowledge of himselfe, in sanctification, and eternall life; so hath he
given a vertue to this his immortall word, to open all things unto us necessary for this knowledge, (and therefore cals it light) to sanctifie, and breed us to life eternall. And as seed simply considered without his appointm
                        •
                     nt could haue no force to produce the like, no more could this word, which therefore by the naturall man is counted foolishnesse,
                  2. In us who are wholly dead in nature, and haue no power in our selues to worke out our owne salvation; but as since the curse, the earth must with much labour be ordered and fitted, before it can be fruitfull; so since our cursed fall, we cannot attaine this fruit, but with this spirituall labour and tillage.
                  3. In God, working in his owne institution: he is the great Husbandman Iohn 15. 1. he that giues the increase, 1 Cor. 3. 6. and 15. 10. Now therefore as no instrument hath power in it selfe to worke to its end, but must be used, applyed, and directed by the hand of the workman: so here unlesse the Spirit use this hammer, it breakes not the stone in our hearts. Looke then as in earthly tillage the ground must be first plowed up and prepared, the labourer must cast in good seed, harrow, weed, &amp;c. and yet still without the former and latter raine, and the blessing of that Almighty Creatour, and Governour all is in vaine; thus God hath made the Law to be as a Coulter to breake up this fallow ground of our hearts, sent in his Ministers with this his plough, to prepare and fit it: so he giues his Gospell to be the seed of life, causeth his servants to scatter it, nay makes the same Ordinance to bee as raine and heate to draw out the vertue and power of it into our practice: yet all this is done by his blessing, he onely giues all the successe, and causeth it to worke to salvation. Vse this first for Instruction;

                        
                           
                           
                              Instruction.
                           1. It is the word of God and that holy doctrine (layd up and treasured in the Scripture, thence brought out to us by the Stewards of Christ in the preached word) which makes men happy. And indeed seeing the Spirit
                           doth there not onely set out one, but the onely way to a blessed estate, we may hence conclude, that there is no other way which leads to happinesse, nor any other appointed, and effectuall (revealed) meane to attaine it, but this. Hence called the power if God to salvation. Rom. 1. 16. 1 Cor. 1.18. Hence it is by the Spirit resembled to such things, as are most necessary causes and helpes of life. Before we attaine the life of God, it is as seed to beget us, 1 Pet. 1. 23. Iam. 1. 18. when we are borne againe, it is food: milke while we are babes, that we may grow; 1 Pet. 2. 2. stronger meate to establish us (Heb. 5.13.14.) when we attaine more ripenesse. Obserue continually, that when the Lord compares this our happines to any earthly thing, still the word of God holds that part in the similitude, which evidently sheweth it to be his instrument, wherby he begins &amp; perfects this worke in us.1 Pet. 2. 5. As when in some places we are likened to the Temple of God,

                           Acts 20. 32. then in other places the Spirit resembles the word to an hammer that breaketh the stone,

When the blessed estate of man is compared to an inheritance, the word is not onely made the meanes whereby we become Sonnes, but is said to giue us inheritance with the Saints. Very frequent are these similitudes in the Scripture. Looke therefore, as in all creatures God hath ordained the fruit, and ther
                              •
                           fore appointed the meanes, which being blessed by him, bring forth their

As when he created the first Adam, he created no more (though he were Almighty to haue of nothing framed many millions) but appointed all other men, yea even Eve her
self to flow from his loynes: so when he gaue our Lord to be the second Adam, he decreed that all his Elect should flow from him, &amp; s

                           2. Seing the word of God is the Guide, which leades us to happinesse, we learne also hence one of the most principal duties of man; namely to heare, read, record, and converse with it, imploying his time in it. Art thou a Minister of the word? then hast thou this precept from God,
                              1 Tim. 4.13. 16 
                              giue attendance to reading: take heed unto learning &amp; continue therein. Art thou an hearer? Thou must be swift to heare.
                              Iames 1. 19. It in authoritie, then Gods charge lies upon thee;Deut. 17.18. 19. 
                              He shall write him this law repeated in a booke, and it shall be with him: and he shall read therein all the dayes of his life, that he may learne to feare the Lord.
                              Ioshua 1. 8. The like command is given to Ioshua. Whatsoever thou art hearken to that generall commandement;Deut. 6. 6.7. 
                              All these words which I command thee this day shall be in thy heart, and thou shalt rehearse them continually.
                              Pro. 4.20.21. 
                              My sonne hearken unto my words incline thine eare unto my sayings. Let them not depart from thine eyes, but keepe them in the midst of thy heart.
                              Col. 3.16. 
                              Let the word of God dwell in you richly. The practise of the Saints answereth this precept:Psal. 119.97. Thus David; he loves the Law; this constant love brought forth continuall meditation. So Ieremie and Iob, Ier. 15. 16. Iob 23. 12.
                           And even our reason it selfe (if we hearken to it) will strongly enforce this dutie upon us. Our owne sense will tell us, that an excellent object of the eye is the writings of m
                                 •
                              n skilfull, wittie, and learned: whereby with little paines we come to know all the fruit of their studies, and reape in a few houres, what they haue laboured many yeares. Now if the writings of prudent and understanding men, in which all their wisedome, and their very soules are opened and discovered to us, be the most noble object of a reasonable creatures eye; then certainely
the most excelling object of a Christian eye is the written word of God; which unlocks, and brings forth unto our view the glorious wisedome of our God. Thy reason therfore will frame this argument. Every creature ought principally to employ it selfe in that, which is the most excellent object of it: but the Scripture is the most excellent object of the eye, therefore the eye must especially busie and employ it selfe in conversing with the Scripture. So likewise the most proper object of the eare is sound, the most excellent object of the eare is the voice of man, and words expressing their notions: but that which infinitely excells it, is the word of God, and his voice, unfolding his gracious purpose towards us, and therefore aboue all other to be most attended &amp; followed. The most proper object of the understanding is truth, the most excellent then must be the truth of God. Certainly the highest degree of happinesse consisteth in our likenesse to God: and therefore our beholding him as he is, being the meanes whereby we are conformed to his image, is of all other things most to bee desired. When therefore we shall see him face to face, and know him as we are knowne, then shall we in our measure be perfected after the similitude of his glory: see 1 Iohn 3. 2. Thus when Moses desired to see the glory of God,
                              Exod. 34.29. 30. though hee could not see him face to face (which no man living on earth can doe) but the backe parts alone (that is; discerned so much onely of his glory, as our imperfect nature can receiue, as when we see the backe of a man, our knowledge is but imperfect) yet his face shined so gloriously, that the people, yea his owne brother Aaron feared to come neere him. Our imperfect happinesse then to which we may attaine on earth is, to bee imperfectly conformed to his likenesse in some degree of holinesse, which is effected by beholding him in his word. For now in the pr
                                 •
                              ached word of God we see him, not indeed face to face, yet not (as the Iewes) veiled, but with open face, and so by looking into that perfect myrrour, wherin
he shines forth unto us in his grace,2 Cor. 3.18. we are changed into the same image by the spirit of the Lord. Looke as the eye receiues into it selfe the object or thing it sees (so that it may be seene in the eye) so the understanding being (as the Philosopher speakes) all to all, taking into it selfe the image of God, expressed in his word, is more &amp; more conformed unto it. A seale joyned to waxe brings forth the same impressure; when therefore the Spirit, having graven this image of God in his holy word, th
                                 •
                              n applies it effectually to the understanding, it cannot but produce the same image and stampe. If therefore we would diligently consider, and compare those places, I
                                    •
                                 r. 9.23.24. and Rom. 10. 14. we would soone confesse; 1. that all our good consisteth in the knowledge of God: and 2. that the knowledge of God depends on his word: and then necessarily acknowledge, that it is a maine dutie of every man to converse with the word of God, and continually to meditate in it.
                        
                        3. It is also a second dutie belonging to every Christian,
                            to bring forth this word which he hath layd up in his heart, for the edification of others, as occasion shall bee offered: this is especially intended by the Apostle;1 Pet. 4 10. 
                           Let every man as he hath received the gift,
                           Iohn 21. 15 
                           minister the same one to another.
                           Acts 20. 28. If thou art in the Ministerie, then hast thou a strict charge from God,
                           1 Pet. 5. 1. 2. to feede the flocke,

                               Tim. 4. 1.2. and to be instant in season and out of season. If thou art one of the sheepe of Christ, yet common is this precept, to be in some kinde a builder: But you Beloved, build up your selues in you
                                 •
                               most holy faith.
                           Iude 20. The word must dwell richly in us, that wee may teach and admonish one another:
                           Colos 3.16. we must exhort one another, and edifie one another.
                           1 Thes. 5.11 Reason also will enforce it; For in common good workes ev

                           mon good of the bodie. The head conveyes sense and motion, the heart life to the more speciall parts: but these deriue it to others, and those other to the rest. Thus is it in the mysticall body. Againe the more we build up others, the more our selues are builded up in faith and every grace. Thus the Apostle knew that by strengthning the Romans, himselfe should receiue further strength and comfort:Rom. 1.11.12 As a good Prince the more he inriches his Kingdome, the more he encreaseth his owne revenewes, and fils his Exchequer. The Saints also regulate their practise by this precept. Thus Aquila and Priscilla take home unto them Apollos,
                           Acts 18.26. an eloquent Teacher,Pro. 4.3.4. and 3
                                 •
                              .1.2. and instruct him more perfectly in the way of the Lord.
                           Gen. 18. 19. 
                           David and Bathsheba instruct Salomon their sonne:1 Sam. 25.31. 
                           Abraham his houshold: nay even a woman feares not to admonish David. Therefore as the Minister being appointed by God, and set over any flocke is bound by the Lord to employ the gifts bestowed on him, to the building of that people, to bring forth old and new as a good Scribe; to shew the light of the word to those that sit in darkenesse, for instruction to the ignorant for refutation to those that erre, for reproofe against such as sinne, for comfort to the afflicted, for exhortation to the sloathfull; so likewise is every Christian bound, as God giues abilitie and opportunitie to apply the same word to the same ends, where they see need of it. Surely if men that are rich in this unrighteous Mammon, are charged not to store it up in chests, but in those living bags, even everie needie Christian; how much more doth the Lord require it as an especial dutie at our hand, to succour any Brother, distressed in any spirituall want, so far as he enableth us with the riches of his grace?
                        
                           
                               4. It is not enough for a Christian to heare, and read the word, frequently to thinke and speake of it, to apply it to others, but he must also bring it out into his practise, and must in all his carriage and conversation shew forth
the fruit of this good seed. Thus the Apostles are commaunded both to haue this light kindled up in their own hearts, and to set it out in their good workes. So the Apostles commaund others,Col. 3. 16. not onely that it must dwell richly within them, but also to hold forth the word of life.
                              Philip 2. 16. Doing is frequently in the Scripture (and in our practise ought ever to be) coupled with hearing. See Iam. 1. 22. Mat. 7. 24. Luk. 8.21. Iohn 13.17. Reason will also further presse this dutie. For,

                                 1. God therefore reveales and teacheth us his will, to that very end, that wee may doe it. See Deut. 6.1. and 29. 29. Now then seeing the end of any action is the accomplishment and perfection of it; that man is an unreasonable creature, who would doe a thing to no end, and no better then a foole, that will doe it but to a wrong end.
                                 2. It is not the hearing, but the doing of the word which makes us blessed: see Mat. 7. 21. Iam. 1. 25. hearing indeed is the way to doing, but doing the way to happinesse.
                                 3. Learning without doing, will heape up more vengeance. Luke 12. 47. For when we know the will of our Prince, Father, Master, this makes our negligence to bee contempt, not onely unexcusable, but heynous.
                              
                           
                           It was a good advice of a Morall Philosopher, who counselled not onely women, but even men also to carry a looking-glasse continually about them: but to this end, that often beholding their feature and forme in it, if they found the outward proportion comely, then to labour that the inside might be correspondent: but if they perceived any naturall deformitie in the body, then to stri
                                 •
                              e to hide or out-shine it with inward beautie. How good counsell is this for a Christian with a little change? wee should ever haue this excellent mirrour about us, to this end, that by it we might mend all our imperfections, and take away the spots of our defiled nature. For certainely to little purpose doth that man behold himselfe in this Glasse, who when he hath seene any blots or filthinesse
in himselfe, doth not presently employ his best endevors to wash and clense his soule. Verily there is nothing that settles and rootes the word in the heart of man but this practise. For as in any other trade or Art, when any precept is layd downe to us, and we presently put it in practise, we make it our owne for ever: but if our practise follow not our Masters instruction, we soone forget it: so is it here: see Iames 1. 23. 24.
                        
                        
                            5. A Christian that intends to come to this happy estate, must continually meditate in the word of God: that is, he must heare, read, thinke of, speake and practice this word frequently, at all occasions, not neglecting any opportunitie: sometime he cannot heare, but then hee may read; sometimes he may not read, but then he may heare: sometimes neither of both, but then hee may thinke of it, recall it into his memorie, and even digest it: sometime he hath fit opportunitie to speake of it, conferring with others, when none of the other can bee used. All these haue, or ought to haue their seasons.
                     
                  
                  For the former, we must set out some times for them: but in practice no time omitted. This part of meditation in the word must be without intermission. Thus are we commaunded; Read all the dayes of thy life, Deut. 17. 19. Rehearse them continually: Talke of them sitting downe, rising up, lying downe, walking abroad. Deut. 6. 7. Meditate day and night, Ioshua 1. 8. Heare as new borne babes, 1 Pet. 2. 2. Doe and keepe them all the dayes of our life, Deut. 6. 1. 2. Thus likewise the Ministers are commaunded, to bee instant in season, out of season: 2 Tim. 4. 2. In the morning to sow their seede, and in the evening not to cease. Eccle. 11. 6. Our reason also will perswade this frequency and continuance. For,

                        1. We know not which the Lord will blesse, which shall prosper, whether this, or that; or whether both shall be good a-like. Wee know not the way of the Spirit. Eccles. 11.5. 6.
                        
                           2. We are very forgetfull in nature, even in civill affaires; but much more in spirituall: you haue forgotten the consolation, Heb. 12. 5. The Israelites forgot the workes of God. Psal. 78. 11. 42. The very Apostles very forgetfull. Mat. 16. 9.
                        3. We are dull of hearing; hard to conceiue these spirituall lessons. Heb. 5. 11. The Apostles perceived not the miracle of the loaues. Mat. 16. 9. when Christ spake most plainely, they vnderstood him not. Luke 18. 31, 32, 33,34. Looke as a man travelling in a journey, howsoever for a night he takes vp his Inne, yet if he doe not continually goe on, and in the morning set forward againe, he cannot come home; so here much more. Had the Israelites returned to AEgypt, had they sate downe in the Wildernesse, had they not in due season still made on: they could not haue come to the Land of rest and promise.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     
                        Reproofe.
                     1. Here is condemned that obstinate and wilfull conceit of men, who dreaming of many other Guides to a blessed estate, are wilfully resolved to resist this truth, that God hath given them his word, to be his onely conduct to happinesse. There is a cursed disposition in our nature, whereby wee are prone to r
                        •
                     sist the holy Ghost, speaking in his word. See Esay 63. 10, Act. 7. 51. This rebellious affectiō our Saviour noted in those Iewes,

                     I am come in my Fathers name and you receiue me not, if any come in his owne name him will you receiue. When any lie is brought to us by Satan, the world, or our deceitful hearts, how easily is it entertain

                     d? little perswasion needes to draw it on: (as) that God will be mercifull, even to those which adde drunkennesse to thirst: (see Deut. 29
                        •
                     19.20.) that by our good meaning and honest intent wee shall com
                        •
                      to heaven; that in grosse ignorance, neglect, and contempt of the word, we shall be saved: such 
                        •
                     ies easily find an open doore in the heart of man, soone enter, and settle there; so that it is impossible almost to driue them
thence. But when God tell us; There is no name under heaven by which thou canst be saved, but onely by Christ;Acts 4. 12. there is no other meanes to make Christ thine, but only by faith: nothing can worke faith but hearing the word; let argument be heaped vpon argument, proofe vpon proofe; make it never so plaine, that now the conscience is utterly convinced, yet are men resolved to stand out, and deny the conclusion. The more foole any man is, the more conceit hath he of wisedome in himselfe; hence it is, that the wisedome of God is despised in the eyes of a car
                        •
                     all proud man. Suppose any of these men were to travaile a long and dangerous journey, of which he knew not one step: if then a friend should tell him; I haue a servant throughly acquainted with every foote of that way, who wil bring you thither safely; take him along with you, &amp; vse him on this occasion: who would refuse such a favour? how thankfull would we be to the Maister? how carefull to follow this Guide? how much would wee make of him? But when the Lord our best friend, giues us his word, the onely Guide, to conduct us to himselfe, and in himselfe (who is both the way, and our happines at the end of it) we cannot be perswaded to make any, or at least any right vse of it: we thinke we can tell the way as well as he, though indeed we never knew, nor trod any one step in it; and in this our wilfulnesse we goe headlong to our destruction.
                  
                      2. That strange neglect of this great dutie, hearing, reading, remembring and repeating in our hearts what we haue heard, is here to be censured. The times which God himselfe hath sanctified for the hearing of his word, is it carefully observed and spent in this employment? As any man is more vile and abject, so doth he more vilely esteeme, and cast behind his backe this commandement of God.
                     Pro. 8. 33. Who accounts himselfe a servant to Christ, bound to waite upon the posts of his doores? Who thinkes himselfe blessed that he may heare him?Ier. 2.31. Doe not men say as those Israelits, Wee are Lords wee will come no
more at thee? Were it a matter of profit or merriment, men could not be kept nor staved off from it. Certainly men in this openly shew, that they haue lesse faith then the Devils. For even these cursed spirits both know the necessitie of the word preached, and are perswaded that by it men attaine a blessed estate: but these brute beasts (and far worse) giue no credit to God himselfe, professing to them this truth.
                  So also the reading of the word how is it slighted by men? Who sets out a time, and resolues to spend it in this dutie? Alas! it is shouldred out by every idle occasion: some haue farmes, some haue bought oxen, some are married; any frivolous excuse is good enough; the common plea is businesse. One hath a great charge, and family he must provide for it: another is taken up with publike affaires; he can spare no time: a third is a poore man, liues by his labour, he can hardly get himselfe bread, &amp;c.
                  
                      But 1. Know all excuses are vaine, and cannot put off the expresse command of God. Thou followest thy publike businesse: why so? Perhaps thy Prince commaunds and expects it. And is Gods commaund of no force with thee? Thou art a poore man, need driues thee to worke for thy living; and art thou not more poore, and beggerly in spirit? and wilt thou not supply thy necessitie? Thou must provide for thy familie: why so? God commaunds it: and doth not the same God commaund thee to read his word, and exercise thy selfe in it? Is it not a more evident token of an Infidell to neglect the labour in thy heavenly, then in thy

                     arthly calling?
                  2. Can businesse excuse thee? Is then the word of God
                      an idle matter? and onely for idle times? Must this chiefe and speciall action of thy life, giue place to every vaine occasion? Should we heare a Husbandman professe, that he had so much businesse, that he could find no time to plow or sow, who would not thinke the man mad? And art thou better in thy wits, who prosessing Christianitie,
                     pleadest thou hast no leasure, by reaso
                        •
                      of other employments, to busie thy selfe in the word of God.
                  
                  
                      3. Businesse cannot excuse, but must incite rather to this dutie. The affaires of Princes are endlesse, yet giue them no exemption from this practice all the dayes of their life: as we heard before Deut. 17. 19. C
                        •
                     rtainely the more businesse thou hast, and employment in earthly matters, the more need hast thou of conversing with the word, as being thy Guide, directing thee how to passe through these cares with a good, cleere, and cheerefull conscience, as also a meanes to make all thy affaires to prosper.
                  
                      4. Thine owne practise will condemne thee; There is a time for every purpose under the Sunne; and thou will not suffer any one employment so to engrosse thy time, but that other occasions shall be served in their season. And wilt thou take from one businesse to giue to another? and yet so little regard this dutie, as to make it waite vpon thy leasure, nay utterly neglect, and exclude it.
                  
                      Lastly, thine owne heart tells thee it is false, when thou pleadest thou hast no time: youth will finde time enough for their sports; elder men to confer of worldly affaires; and the oldest to prattle of things long since out of remembrance: and hadst thou as much will, as time, thou wouldest finde sufficient leasure for this dutie.

                      3. Those are here reproved, who instruct not others (as they are able) in the word. If they haue knowledge
they laugh and despise, but teach not the ignorant. Haue they servants grosly blind, so let them lie: they will never offer to bring them out of this darkenesse: nay even wi
                        •
                     es and children they instruct not: hence God curseth them with eye-servants, untoward and froward women, disobedient children. If they see a Brother sinne, doe they apply a seasonable and loving reproofe or admonition? when they see men over-seene in drinke, heare others sweare; doe they reproue the offender, that he may be found in the faith? No such matter. They make themselues merrie with such enormous sins by which God is made angry, &amp; his wrath provoked; by wch they evidently discover themselues, that they are not seasoned with any one graine of true and saving grace, which is as a leaven spreading, and catching like fire, ever communicating it selfe, as it hath power, to any with whom we liue and converse. If wee see a man able (though not bound to it) neglect a common worke, we will thinke and judge hardly: and how are we to be blamed, who neglect this common worke belonging to all Christians, especially being bound to it as well in charitie to our Brethren, as by the evident and peremptory commaund of God, Levit. 19. 17. When we see any dejected with the sight of sinne, we will either jest at it, or perswade him it is melancholie, draw him to companie, so to driue out the worke of Gods Spirit with some worke of Satan. Thus we are so farre from provoking such as goe slowly by exhortation to mend their pace, that rather we discourage them in their beginnings, and by opposing our selues would stop and turne them backe to their former deadnesse. Oh! if men, especially those who are of more knowledge, and greater place, would joyne in this worke of God with his builders, how fast would the Temple of the Lord rise, aud goe forward? how blessed would this Nation and Church be? But now when the Minister is forsaken, and left alone to all this busines, having so many lets and opposites, it is no marvaile if the
building goe on very slowly. But let us take good heed to our selues: marke the cheerfull disposition of the people toward the rearing up the Tabernacle. Such was their willing liberalitie, that Moses was enforced by proclamation to restraine their readinesse in offering. Compare Exod. 35. 5. 6. 21.22. 23. with chap. 36. 5. 6. How shall they condemne this generation who utterly withdraw their hand from this holy worke, and will not so much as lend us a copie of their countenance, toward the rearing of Gods living Temples.
                  
                  How lewdly doe many neglect the practise of this divine law? Certainely as any dutie is more for Gods honour, and their profit, so is it by them more despised: they will read rather then heare, heare rather then practise: the corrupt nature of man detesteth this subjection. Rom. 8. 7. If God commaund any thing, be it never so easie or delightfull, it is hated: so the Sabboth: but what he forbids, be it never so grievous, they will doe it: as kill themselues; sacrifice their children to Divels.
                  Very many are open Rebels, and though they are called, and would be counted Christians, yet resolutely refuse to yeeld subjection to the law of Christ: and will not sticke plainely to proclaime it.Ier. 44. 16.17. 
                     The word which thou hast spoken to us in the name of the Lord, wee will not heare it of thee, but wee will doe whatsoever thing goeth out of our mouth: and so palpably doe they trangresse, that when they haue sworne obedience and professe it in generall, they will utterly deny it in the particulars: compare Ier. 42. 5. 6. with that 43. 2. 4. especially where they are crost in those things, which their owne wicked hearts haue determined. Others are not so open, but will make good shewes in civill, nay perhaps (outwardly) religious carriage; yet are but hypocrites; of whom our Saviour speakes Mat. 7. 26. They are no better then very Idiots, they would attaine and possesse the house not made with hand, but lay no foundation. Christ there distinguisheth
the faithfull from the hypocriticall hearer, and seeming Christian: looke on them with a lesse heedfull eye, both will seeme alike, both as well builded houses; but one with a foundation, the other without it: now that ungrounded building may stand, till a tempest come, but no longer. Thus here, an hypocrite will repaire to the word as readily, will sit as orderly, seeme as greedy in outward attention as the best: but he never layeth the foundation by digging out his owne earthly heart, and setling there that corner stone, by denying himselfe for Christ, and renouncing his owne will and affections.
                  
                     
                     
                        Exhortation
                     3. Stirre up thy dull heart, and quicken it to all diligence in attending upon the word of God, plead no excuse, but remember the commaund of God: Bee swift to heare. Be not a forgetfull hearer.

The maine argument and motiue impelling to this dutie, is here expressed; This shall bring thee to happines: thy thoughts, thy actions looke all this way: diddest thou thinke any thing more helpefull to this end then other, thou wouldest use it: beleeue God in his word, who assures thee that this meditation in his Law, shall certainly effect it for thee.
                  Adde to this, the danger of thy neglect. Thou shalt find no favour from God in that evill day, if thou despise this dutie; remember,Pro. 28.9.

                  But what meanes should we use to bring our hearts to this dutie. 1. Remoue that pride of heart, and conceit of being increased in goods, and wanting nothing:
                     Rev. 3.17. for the full stomacke despiseth an honey combe:
                     Pro. 27.7. See Ieremie 13. 15 2. Remoue all worldly thoughts, cleare thy heart from
those thornie cares, when thou enterest into the house of God. 3. Further thy selfe by earnest prayer, frequently calling upon God, (from sense of thine owne wants, and confidence of his supply) for his powerfull assistance in his owne holy Ordinance.
               
            
            
               
               Psalme I. Verse iij. And hee shall bee like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season, his leafe also shall not wither, and whatsoever hee doth shall prosper.
               
                  LOOKE as men, confident that their wares are good which they would vent, will not sticke to giue us a tast, nay call and invite us to assay their wine or any such commoditie; or rather, as a friend who having purchased a goodly seat, and desires to joyne some deere friend or brother as purchaser with him, will first propound it in generall, and commend it as worth his money, and after parcell it out in the particulars; so here the Pro

                     het, or rather Christ in him, having in the first word of this Psalme orderly set before us in generall, and more confusedly that end of man, which by all is desired, and then described the way, which leads either from it, or to it; now more distinctly discovers the particulars of this happy estate, that hee may more strongly incite our slow feete to runne in this way, and so attaine our desires.1 Cor. 2. 9. Now because the things which God hath prepared for them that loue him, eye hath not
seene, eare hath not heard, neither haue entred into the heart of man: hence the Wisedome of God descending to our weakenesse, hath expressed them to us: 1. by a comparison, such as being very familiar, and in every eye might worke the better upon the beholder. And because it was impossible in any one, or very many similitudes to set forth all the particulars of this blessed condition, hee instanceth onely in some, such as are eminent, and such as when they are well considered are most fit to worke upon our affections, and fasten them unto it.
               First therefore he layeth out this happinesse by a resemblance of a plant; which he describes by some circumstances.
               2. By some effects or properties; A tree not wild, but husbanded, planted, and (as some render it) transplanted.
               
               3. By the place where it is seated, by the rivers of water. The effects are likewise two; 1. fruitfulnesse; 2. a perpetuall flourishing.
               
               The sense then is. As you see a tree, digged out of a barren and thirstie land, transplanted to a fat, and fruitfull soile, and rooted by a running water, is even laden with choice fruit, and keepeth it selfe in a flourishing estate; so is it with those, who having forsaken the dry wildernesse of sinne, where they either walked in the counsell of the ungodly, stood in the way of sinners, or sate in the seate of the scornefull, and are now by the hand of that great Husbandman transplanted, and seated by those fountaines and rivers of his word, they grow fruitfull in grace, and are entred into an inde-flourishing estate, that neither their profession, nor fruit shall fade, till they attaine to the fulnesse of happinesse with Christ in glory. Secondly the Prophet describes this happinesse, by one especiall part of it: whatsoever he doth shall prosper.
               
               From the similitude two propositions may be gathered: the first from the circumstances.
               
                  
                  
                     Proposition
                  
                  Hee that forsaketh wicked wayes, and delighteth and meditateth constantly in the word of God, is like a tree planted by the rivers side.
               
               
                  The second from the effects.
               
                  Hee that forsaketh the way of sinne, delights and meditates in Gods word, is like a tree which bringeth forth fruit in season, whose leafe shall not fade.
               
               In the former three things must be unfolded. 1. what kind of tree is here intended. 2. in what respect the faithfull are compared to a tree planted. 3. what it is which answers to the rivers of water in this similitude.
               For the first; The kind is set downe (in generall onely) a tree; but by all probabilitie the Palme-tree especially intended. This may appeare 1. by some circumstances from this place: 1. because (as Plinie affirmes) the Palme delights in running waters; and desires continually to drinke; 2. because the fruit of the Palme is ever in waxing: some budding, while others are growing, and while these grow, others ripen: so that they are three yeares before they come to any perfection. Lastly the leafe of the Palme withers not, but continues greene, even in winter. 2. In other places we find this comparison more plainely specified: The righteous flourish like the Palme tree.
                  Psal. 92. 12.
               
               For the second, in what regard the faithfull are thus compared, is very plaine. Trees are planted, either by being wholy removed from one place to another, or when a sience is cut off from one stocke, and grafted into another. Thus in the Scripture we shall find, that men are taken out of the world, and removed to the house of God; and especially we shall often read the similitude of grafting applied to the Saints; because growing naturally in the first Adam, we are cut off from that wild stocke, and are implanted into the second 
                     
                        •
                     dam, Christ Iesus.
               
               3. Lastly waters may be here taken for the word of God, the water of the Sanctuary:
                  Ezek. 47. such as is drunke downe into the soule by the eare.Esay 55.1.3. 10.11. So againe Apollos is said to water. 1. Cor. 3. 6.Iohn 7.38.39 Againe water may here signifie the Spirit;
not as there is in water a power to wash, and clense, (as sometimes it is taken) but as moisture is an especially principall of life: the word, and Spirit being to a Christian, for eternall life, as moisture to a plant or palme. So the sense of the point is:
               
                  Whosoever forsaketh the way of wickednesse, and constantly delights in the word, and meditates in it, is like to a palme, which a man transplanteth into a fertile soile, hee shall bee nourished with those pure rivers of the Sanctuary: hee shall be watered by the Spirit of grace.
               
               
                  Proofe. Ier. 17
                     •
                   7. 8. and Rom. 11. 23. As for grounds, we shall not need to insist on any. Sufficient is it to name those, which the Spirit himselfe hath mentioned; the bountie and goodnesse of God. Rom. 11.22. Apply this 1. for Instruction.
               
               
                  
                  
                     Instruction.
                  1. As a tree transplanted, or a sience grafted into a new stocke, is altogether altered in the qualitie, so whosoever is ordained to a blessed estate, must bee, and in due time is wholy changed, and entred into a new condition, much differing, nay indeed quite contrary to the former. This alteration is expressed in Scripture many wayes: sometime we are commanded in plaine words to be changed or metamorphosed (as Rom. 12. 2) even moulded or stamped; and so to be fashion
                     •
                  d after the image of the Lord, 2 Cor. 3. 18. So likewise that word which is used most commonly for repentance, as Mark 1. 15. signifies a change of the mind, that as repentance is the first evidence of our happinesse, so it consisteth of a through alteration both of the inward and outward man. Thus also by metaphors, and many full similitudes it is frequently described by the Spirit. The former estate of man is called darkenesse, the new light:Ephe. 5. 8. so that as palpable as the change is from night to day, and as contrary as darkenes is to light; so is it here.
               Now this darkenesse intends. 1. A grosse ignorance of God, and of his will, which is the cause of all miserie.
For as to know God is the onely happinesse, and nothing else worth the rejoycing;Ier. 9. 23. 24. it is eternall life:Ioh. 17.3. so ignorance of God must of necessitie be miserie, and death eternall. Thus the Apostle describes this difference plainly.1 Cor. 2. 14. 15. 
                  The naturall man doth not, cannot discerne the things of God, as being spiritually discerned: the spirituall man discerneth all things.
               
               2. Darkenesse is taken in the word for that sinfull filthinesse, which abhorres the light: and for all manner of hatefull and abominable iniquitie: see Ioh. 3. 19. called therefore the workes of night, and of darkenesse.
                  1 Thes. 5. 7. So againe the Spirit resembles this estate to a new man and a new creature.

                  eding beautifull, even to ravish the eye: so that state of sinne, that body of death, from which we are changed, if we could throughly looke into it, is more foule, and
loathsome then any corporall pollution: but that life of Christ more louely and ravishing, then wee in this glimmering light can possibly conceiue and imagine.
               But to passe by very many similitudes, none is more frequent then this of grafting: And as grafting is double, either by implanting a base sience into a noble and generous stocke, or letting a good and pleasant sience into a base and sower stocke: so in this spirituall planting, we shall find sometime the stocke to be Christ, (the true vine, and naturall Olive) sometime our cursed nature is compared to the body of tree, and the word of God resembled to the graft, as Iam. 1. 21. so then as a wild oliue grafted into a true, is partaker of the sap, and fruit of the good Oliue, and is utterly changed, and becomes of another nature and tast; so when we are grafted into Christ, wee receiue all spirituall influence from him, whereby ws are fruitfull: for without him we can do
                     •
                   nothing Iohn 15. 5. Likewise as when a good graft is let into a wild crab-stocke, the sience so alters and sweetens that sower and harsh juice of the stocke, that the fruit becomes altogether contrary to the former, and is very pleasant: so when the word is grafted into us it so changes our affections, and all the inward man, that we bring forrh (cleane contrary to our corrupt nature
                     •
                  ) the pleasant fruit of righteousnesse. There must bee therefore, and certainely is, a change in man before he can attaine any happinesse What it is, may be gathered by that which hath beene spoken, and specially from this comparison: for when we transplant any tree, wee doe it to this end, that wee may enjoy better fruit of it, as disliking that which is naturall to it.
               To open it yet morefully, the former similitudes excellently set it out unto our eyes. As first that metaphor of light, that by nature wee are even naturalls, or mad men, in respect of spirituall understanding: hauing the eye of supernaturall reason in the knowledge of God quite put out, and in the stead of that lightsome eye representing
spiritualll things, an hellish, darke, and divelli
                     •
                  h eye, full of lies, succeeds it. The losse of the former necessarily inferres ignorance of good; the other presents to us evill in the forme, and appearance of good; As fooles, by want of naturall wisedome, know not the worth of things excellent, and by a childish folly esteeme highly of vaine, uselesse, and unprofitable things: or as mad men, that haue no knowledge of their friends but esteeme them enemies, and desperately in spight of all good counsell, runne into any danger, or mischiefe: so senselesse man hating indeed God himselfe, and all the meanes and offers of life, willingly followes the Devill through sinne unto hell; can discerne no goodnes in that which is truely good, but seemes to see much content in vanitie; and that which leads him to destruction.
               In a word before our transplantation our fruits are described by the Spirit,
                  Gal. 5.19.20. 21.22.23. namely adulterie, fornication, uncleannesse, lasciviousnesse, Idolatry, withcraft, hatred, variance, emulation, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murthers, drunkennesse, revilings, and such like: after our implanting we may see the spirituall fruits set out in the same place: love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentlenesse, goodnesse, faith, meekenesse, temperanee, and such like: see also 1 Cor. 6. 9. 10. 11. Necessary is this change, seing we are all naturally accursed, but without it there can be no passage from cursing to blessing, from one contrary to another. Againe God the Father hath decreed for the honour of the Sonne, that all nations shall bee blessed in him, and none saved but by his name; that he shall bee the head of every creature; Now then wee must of necessitie be cut off from the first Adam, before we can be grafted into the second Adam, and cannot be blessed in him, till we be grafted into him.
               2. Whosoever forsakes his sinne, and with delight meditates in the word of God day and night, that word shall bee to him as water to a plant, it shall continually
nourish him in the life of grace, and that gracious and holy Spirit shall as a River feede and sustaine him in this blessed life, that he may continue and daily encrease in this spirituall fruitfulnesse. This is here evidently a
                     •
                  firmed by the Psalmist; often and strongly confirmed by other Scriptures, and the examples of the Saints.
                  Ioh. 5.24. 
                  He that heareth me hath everlasting life.

                     3.2. 
                  He makes them to rest in green pastures, and leads them by the still waters; They shall bee as a watered garden, and like a spring of water,
                  Esay 58. 11.

                  Ier. 31. 12. And againe, Their soule shall be as a watered garden. Certainely that holy Spirit himselfe enters into us by his word. Gal. 3. 2. Acts 10. 33.44 And even hence is it, that the Spirit compareth the word so often to seed, and food: as the meanes whereby life, growth, and strength spirituall is given us. Every severall creature hath his peculiar nourishment, but this onely is the food which nourishes the new creature to life eternall. True is it of the bodily, much more of spirituall life, that man liues not by bread onely, but by every word that commeth out of the mouth of God. Thus when the Thessalonians received the word, not as mans, but Gods, it was effectuall, and wrought mightily in them.

                   found himselfe dull, heartlesse, and dead in performance of any dutie, he had recourse to this word, and found quickning grace. Psal. 119. 50.93. And indeed as every creature hath his force and worke by Gods appointment and ordinance, and not by any thing of it selfe, and therefore worketh only to that end, which he hath set out for it; so this word is by him ordained to this purpose, namely to giue and maintaine spirituall life, and hence it powerfully worketh, and misseth not this effect. Manifest is it, that in the word written, the image of the essentiall word, even of Christ is engraven and figured by the Spirit of God; and evident, that our soules are as waxe, liable to any impression good or bad. Now then when that blessed Spirit applieth this word to our hearts, having before prepared and fitted them for it, and
often by delight and meditation renewes this impression; hee will bring in us, still continue, and daily renew the same forme and image in our soules.
               
                   3. Wheresoever this word hath made an effectuall entrance, and brought in with it the spirit of grace; that word and Spirit shall be not onely as water, but as rivers of water. Standing waters will soone be corrupt, stinke, and become unhealthfull, and noysome to the body; but running waters are ever sweete and wholesome. Standing waters will dry up and faile, but the Rivers (fed with living Springs) continue and endure, even in heat and drought; Such as forsaking this word, follow their owne devices, are like those who make pits, and forsake the rivers: their pits yeeld unwholesome and poysonous waters, and soone are dryed up and faile; but hee that cleaues to the word, and Spirit working in it, shall be certaine to finde health and continuall supply. This comparison is used by the Spirit Ier. 2. 13. Obserue those words in the Prophet, Ezek. 47. 8. 9. 11. There we shall perceiue, that those running waters of the Sanctuary are very healthfull, but when wretched men mingle them with their owne mire, their owne muddie braines and inventions, they shall be as salt pits, not healed. There is no doubt but these waters are the Apostolicall doctrines, delivered by them first in preaching, secondly in writing: This is that wholesome doctrine so often commended to the Ministers of God. 1 Tim. 1. 10. and 6. 3. 2 Tim. 1.13. Tit. 1.9. and 2. 1. So likewise it continues and stayes by us: when this seed is sowen it abideth in us,1 Ioh. 3. 9. 
                  It shall not be taken from us.
                  Luke 10. 42. Marke the covenant of God. He puts his law into the hearts of the faithfull, and writes it in their inward parts, so that this law shall not be razed out, nor the Covenant broken, as the former, but such a feare of his name there setled, that they shall never depart from God. Read Ier. 31. 33. and 32.40. It shall be as a living fountaine in the heart, springing up to life eternall. See Iohn 4. 14. and 7. 38. 39.

                  2 Cor. 4. 7. and are broken: but the word which they bring surviues them, and thousand generations after them. Read Zach. 1.5.6. To shut up this point: for continuance both of the word and Spirit, we haue that faithfull promise made to our head.Esay 59. 21. 
                  As for me, this is my covenant with them saith the Lord; My spirit which is upon thee, and my words which I haue put into thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, and out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seeds seed, sayth the Lord, from henceforth, and for ever.

                  Psal 78. 34. 35.36. 
                  When God slew them, then they sought him, then they remembred God was their strength: but they did but 
                        •
                     latter and dissemble. Thus their children,Ier. 34. 10. 11. compared with 21. 22. verses. when the feare of the Babylonians pressed them, they obeyed; as soone as they departed, they repented of their obedience, and returned to their sinne: but the faithfull haue this water of life flow in them, nay in the day of tentation they faile not, but then often abound more plentifully then at any other time. It is recorded of Iordan that even in harvest he over-flowed all his bankes:
                  Iosh. 3.15. so is it with those waters of the true Israell of God, they flow even in the time of heat and drought; in tryals of affliction, even the most fierie tryals, the word and Spirit leaue them not, but with more full tides water and comfort their soules. Thus was it in Iob; thus with this Psalmist: see Psal. 119. 92. 143. As the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.
                  2 Cor. 1.5. Know then, that as long as wee retaine the old leaven, loving the world, and cleaving in heart unto it, and the sinfull profits, pleasures, and affections of it, we haue no signe of this happinesse in us. If this blessed word &amp; Spirit doe not flow into us, wash out our uncleannes, drunkennes, covetousnes, &amp; all such corruptions; nay if that holy Spirit leads us not forward into the good way, and causeth us cheerefully to goe on in every path of holinesse, wee haue no title to true blessednesse.

                   1. How can we sufficiently admire the impudence of those men, who are not, and professe they are not changlings? Consider them, and you shall finde, that as they were twenty yeares agoe, so are they now. Ignorant then, without any knowledge of God, and now as ignorant: they come to Church, they heare the word, but the Prince of darkenesse holds their eyes, that they should not discerne the light of God. Others perhaps attaine more
knowledge, but walke still in darkenesse: the same cursed wayes they followed before, they still go on in them: they were swearers, cursers, Sabboth-breakers, drunkards, covetous oppressours, extortioners, railers, uncleane: so remaine they still, and increase: perhaps somewhat changed, but for the worse: one sinne for another: one Devill cast out, and seaven other entred: dead were they in nature, dead in sinnes and trespasses, and what now? but more rotten, and stinking; the very wormes of hell crawling upon them, and eating their soules. Before they neglected goodnesse in themselues, now they despise and deride it in others. When they are called to come out of this miserable estate, and the Spirit in the Ministery of the word cryes aloud unto them: Turne you, why will yee dye? they desperately answer, not in their hearts onely, and in secret, but openly in their rebellious actions, nay some impudently in their words;Ier. 18. 12. 
                  Surely wee will walke after our owne imaginations, and doe every man after the stubbornesse of his owne wicked heart. Oh woefull, oh miserable, and desperate estate! when wee read of those poore wretches possessed with legions of Devils,Mat. 8. 28. carrying them from Cities, the companie of their friends,Mark .5. and all living men, to the dead, there to lodge in graues, beating and striking themselues with stones, and breaking all bonds, we even tremble to thinke of their fearefull estate: But wee are blinde to see our owne miserie; nay though we cannot but see it, here pictured out unto us, we haue no sense of it, who once thinkes with himselfe; Is not this my condition? Am I any thing better? How many uncleane Spirits possesse this miserable soule and body? A spirit of ignorance and blindnesse (even the Prince of darkenesse) holds my understanding captiue in the chaines of darkenesse; A spirit of profanesse possesseth my heart, and prisoneth it in unbeliefe, benumbes it with securitie and deadnesse; A lying Spirit holds my tongue, and makes my mouth a very shop and forge of slanders and reproaches against the Saints of God, and his
truth; A spirit of blasphemie possesses my lippes, and thence continually shoots out lewd and horrible oathes against heaven. A spirit of covetousnesse, a spirit of drunkennesse, a spirit of lust, and uncleanesse, a very hell is in this wretched heart. These cursed spirits cause me to breake all bonds of sense, reason. religion, of dutie to God, and man, and carry me headlong from my friends, to mine enemies, from the land of the living, to the chambers of eternall death: They use mine owne hands against my selfe, and make every member a weapon of unrighteousnesse against mine owne soule and life, nay against God whose loue is better then life. And now see yonder the Lord Iesus offereth himselfe unto me for my salvation: Shall I be worse then that Daemoniake? Shall I not flye to him for succour? Nay he invites me, and shall I refuse him? Alas! we haue no sense thus to put on our soules; but while the strong man holds possession, all is at peace.
               
                   Those likewise are here sharply to be rebuked, who esteeme little of the Sabboth, and those holy duties belonging to it, even the service of the most holy God, and thinke nothing else of it, but of a custome and common use of men. As many who come to the Courts of earthly Lords for fashion, and feare of amercement, or some like respect; so doe most Christians draw neere to the Courts of the Lord of heaven; many seldome, nay most never considering the cause of this Ordinance, either why, or by whom it was commanded. Surely if onely our service, and homage (which thus we acknowledge) should call for it, and there were no other end, but onely the honour and glory of our Creatour, and Redeemer, were not this sufficient, nay abundant to draw us to a diligent performance of this dutie?
               He

against him: and would not this challenge a much greater matter at our hand, then to come into his presence, there to honour him, there to heare him informe us in his will, and to put up our complaints and petitions to him, by which we acknowledge him our Lord and Soveraign? which indeed is rather a gr

                  able povertie of our soules, so many grievances, nakednesse, blindnes, nay a very hell upon earth thrusteth us forward, and tels us to our face, there is no helpe in us, but points us out to him, and to his Courts, which he hath made his Storehouse, there to cover our filthy nakednesse by putting on Christ, so glorious cloathing, there to giue light to our eyes, there to poure out to us the great riches of his grace, there by waiting on the posts of his doores to make us blessed and happy; In a word, by observing a temporall rest of grace, to bring us to his eternall rest of glory: what contempt of God, what cursed Atheisme, nay what spirituall madnesse drawes away our hearts from this dutie? It is indeed no marvaile to see a foole, or distracted man neglect those persons, and duties in which consists their well-being: for the cause is evident, the want or deprivation of that reason, which should guide them in such actions; but to heare a man confesse, my experience teacheth me, that all earthly things (so farre as I haue enjoyed them) are vanitie and vexation: the Scripture teacheth me, that there is no happinesse, no nor content for man, but onely the enjoying God, who is indeed the onely supreme good; I cannot enjoy God, nor ever see him with comfort, but onely by holinesse: Heb. 12. 14. I cannot attaine to holinesse, but onely by the truth, which is the word of God: Iohn 17. 17. and aboue all things I desire to be happy; to see now this man despise the word of God, and set more light by it then by
his old shooes, how can we wonder enough at such a disposition?Ier. 2.12.13. 
                  Oh you heavens be astonied at this, be afraid and utterly confounded saith the Lord: for my people haue committed two evils, they haue forsaken me the fountaine of living waters, and digged them pits, even broken pits which will hold no water. What creature (even the heaven it 
                     •
                  elfe) may not wonder, and tremble to thinke, that those who professe themselues Gods people, and confesse him their fountaine of all life and comfort, should yet forsake him, even in those Ordinances, whereby as by pipes, he conveyes his grace, and imparts himselfe to them, drawes them home, and unites them to himselfe, and should cleaue unto their vanities, which their owne sense and experience will tell them are but meere deceits, and lyes promising much happinesse, performing all miserie; here vexation, hereafter damnation.
               
                  
                  
                     Consolat.
                  4. The beginning, weake, and distressed Christian hath here an handle offered him to take hold of comfort, and apply it to his troubled soule. Many a weakling, who sees in himselfe nothing but a delight in the law of God in the inward man, and rather a desire, then a power to meditate in it, is not a little grieved, yea amazed. He lookes into his soule, findes there many sinfull infirmities, nay fleshly rebellions against the Spirit, standing out, and not yeelding to the law of God; sometime leading him captiue to the law of sinne; and in this particular, although he find a thirst of the word, before he come; comfort and delight in hearing, yet both when hee is in the house of God, many times distractions of vaine thoughts withdraw his eare; and when he is gone, waut of memorie makes the word nothing so fruitfull as it should be: and to weigh downe all this evill, he sees no other good, but onely his delight in the law of God, and some fruits of it, as lamenting his sinfull estate, wrastling against his cursed nature; and hence he is not a little troubled, and many times grievously affrighted.
               
                  But know 1. it is thus with Gods dearest children, as with the Apostle. He could not doe the good thing he would. That measure of obedience in hearing, and doing the will of God, which he desired to giue, he could not giue it: the evill which hee would not doe, hee did: perhaps vaine thoughts in hearing God, and speaking from him, and such like sinfull infirmities faine he would haue utterly cast off but could not: he saw much miserie in his nature, sinfull rebellion against the law of God; to answere all this, he found nothing but his delight in the law of God, yet was hee a most deere child of God, and in an happy estate.
               2. Remember that where once the Spirit hath made a channell to convey into any heart his word and grace, he never leaues it dry. This good part shall not bee taken from thee:
                  Luke 10.42.

How long doth many a good Minister preach with diligence, before he sees the least hope of fruit? At length some few blades spring up here and there: why then shouldest thou expect seede time and harvest all in a day? Consider the exhortation Iames 5. 7. The Husbandman waiteth for the precious (yet corruptible) fruit of the earth, and hath long patience: shouldst not thou with more comfort and patience wait for that incorruptible and heavenly fruit promised in fulnesse to those that hunger for it? Dost thou then find that good seed cast into thy heart? Dost thou feele it begin to roote it selfe in a constant delight? Doth it send forth any fruit, and shew it selfe, though yet weakly? Remember thy harvest is but in the blade as yet, and thy faith a graine of mustard seed, the least of seeds, but when once growne, the greatest among hearbs. Mat. 13. 32.

                  ference betwixt these conditions and estates of men, excellently resembled in (those two types) those two Countries so contrary, AEgypt and Canaan. Read it set out to thee Deut. 11. 10.11. 12.
               2. Consider the disposition of every creature; No man will refuse to flit from a dwelling, in which he sees and findes many discommodities, to a place wher he shall enjoy an happy estate, and liue in health and plentie. If thou desirest to know the meanes; it is by receiving the word grafted with meekenesse Iam. 1.21. Now this meeknesse is that Christian vertue which proceeding from humilitie, and being opposite to frowardnesse and stubbornnesse of heart, bends, and bowes our soules in all gentlenesse to the yoake of Christ, as acknowledging him the just Commaunder, our selues his subjects and servants.
               
                  
                     Proposition 2.
                  
                     
                     
                        Proposition
                     The second proposition in this verse drawne from the properties, is;
                  
                     Hee that delights and meditates in the word of God day &amp; night, is like to a tree that bringeth forth fruit in season, whose leafe shall never fade.
                  
                  In which are two especiall things, making up and accomplishing the happinesse of the faithfull soule, which seekes the Lord in his word: 1. The effects and fruits following this planting and watering: 2. The perseverance or continuance in this estate.
                  The effects are two; 1. in this life the fruit of grace: 2. in the other the fruitiō of glory. For I take it as certaine that the Spirit here intendeth both: as well because glory
is the especiall part of our blessednesse here described; as also because this bringing forth fruit in season will rather agree to that perfect fruit which we receiue in glory, then the other. No sooner is the tree transplanted, but fruit instantly followes; but the perfection and full ripenesse of it is not here gathered, but hereafter in heaven. Some here resemble faith to the leafe, but that being the speciall fruit of grace, cannot fitly be thus compared. The purpose of the Spirit without all question, by the never-fading leafe, is to expresse the ever-flourishing estate, and life of the godly. It is not therefore necessary to descend to any particular, and in this similitude to liken any one thing in the faithfull to this leafe, but sufficient, that as the tree whose leafe is ever green, continually flourisheth and even in the midst of winter liues and prospers; so the godly in the most troublesome stormes of all tryall and tentation, shall p
                        •
                     rsevere in this spirituall life, and even then shall sucke that heavenly sap from Christ, and openly flourish in an holy profession.
                  Now I see not any difficultie in these words, but onely it may seeme doubtfull, in what sense these f
                        •
                     uits of grace and glory are said to bee produced in season. For that of glory, the season is only knowne to God,
                     Acts 1. 7. 
                     who hath put the times and seasons in his owne power, and brings forth this fruit in some sooner, in some later, as seemes best to his owne wisedome: onely this may bee observed, that as the Palm
                           •
                        
                      ripens his fruit not suddainely, but is three yeeres (longer then any tree) concocting and mellowing it, before it come to full maturitie; so it pleaseth the Lord not instantly to ripen this fruit of his Spirit, and perfect us in compleat holinesse, but often by a slow progresse, and no hasty growth brings us to that supreame happines and full perfection.
                  For that other fruit namely of grace: ordinarily it is interpreted, as opposed too those to hasty fruits, which suddainely ripening, and before due time, are of no use but sowre and unsauorie: of which we use to say in the proverbe;
soone ripe, soone rotten. Leaving to every one his owne sense, so farre as it is not repugna
                        •
                     t to the rule of faith, I doe not willingly consent to this interpretation. First because I cannot easily beleeue, that any spirituall fruit can either spring, grow, or ripen too soone; and am perswaded, that it is the proverbe of Satan hatched in hell, A young Saint, an old Divell. Secondly because even that ca
                        •
                     kasse of faith, which is in hypocrites,Mat. 13.21. who are the stony ground, is but a blade, no fruit; a blade without a roote, as is evident in the parable. I would rather 
                        •
                     nderstand it as thus intended. As there are many fruits of the Spirit, so are they not all produc
                        •
                     d at one time; some presently shew themselues, but other some spring not till a long time after: onely the seed, and roote of them is in the heart, but the fruit appeares not, and yet in due time the fruit shall follow. The sense then is this;
                  
                     He that delights and meditates in the word, shall not onely fructisie in grace, and attaine in good time every good gift of the Spirit, but shall certainly in Gods season grow to a further degree of ripenesse, and at length to a full maturitie, and glorious holinesse, and this fruitfull and glorio
                           •
                        s estate shall not decay: the fruit of grace shall not utterly perish, but shall surely end in endlesse and perfect glory.
                  
                  See for proofe Ierem. 17. 8.
                        Proofe.
                      Thus when the word is rightly heard, fruit followes Luke 8. 15. no lesse fruit springs from this seede then life, yea everlasting life, Iohn 4. 24.
                  
                     Iohn 15. 16.The grounds or reasons may be: 1. The grace of God in electing: you haue not chosen mee, but I haue chosen you, and ordained, that you should bring forth fruit, and your fruit shall remaine.
                  
                  2. The blessed Spirit working in it. Gal. 5.22.
                  3. The nature of the word, which God hath made to be as seed:1 Pet. 1.23. now every seed hath a vertue and force to produce the like.
                  4. The materiall and maine cause is the roote that beareth
us, even Christ Rom. 11. 18. see Iohn 15.4.5. Looke then as the tree, such is the branch: thus the Lord Iesus being full of grace, which was delt unto him not by measure, Iohn 3. 34. distributes to every one, which is grafted into him that measure which is requisite for that part, which he holds in his body: Iohn 1. 16. Ephe. 4. 16. And seeing himselfe, being risen from the dead dieth no more (Rom. 6. 9.) he giues this never-fading life to those who are his members, Iohn 6. 37. 56. 57. 58.
                  
                     
                     
                        Instruction.
                     Learne then here for instruction, that it is altogether impossible, that soule should be barren in spirituall fruit, which delights and meditates in the word of God. Now as in earthly, so in these heavenly fruits, there are many kindes, and every kind diversified into other. The chiefe of the spirituall are godlinesse, righteousnes, and sobrie
                           •
                        ie. In godlinesse sundry and divers particulars; some which we receiue and returne not, some which we both receiue and returne. Of the first sort the chiefe is peace, a fruit wonderfully pleasant. I haue read of some fruits which haue so affected the tast, that the whole body hath instantly felt a sudden alteration, and even shook and shuddered with the delight it received. Sure I am, no fruit in earthly Paradise could compare with this peace. Oh when an afflicted soule, which hath beene long schorched with that hellish flame, the sense of Gods wrath for sinne, drinkes downe this peace in a full draught of that bloud, which is drinke indeed,
                     Ioh. 6.55. it is impossible for any man to utter, nay to conceiue the content it enjoyes, but onely those, who by experience haue felt it. How sweetly doe they rest (as new borne babes) in a delightfull cradle of heavenly ease and tranquillitie, leaning themselues, as the beloved Disciple, on the bosome of Christ, while glorious Angels sing about them, Peace on earth, good will toward men?
                     Luke 2. 14. Another of those fruits is joy, springing from the former, nothing inferiour, nay aboue the other. It is unspeakable and glorious.
                     1 Pet. 1.8. It remoues all sense of corporall
evill, changes scourges, rackings, and all manner of torment; so that as things very tart &amp; bitter, by being boyled in sugar, become very sweete and delightfull: so all these grievances seasoned by this over-ruling joy are wholy altered, and the most extreame pangs are turned into ease and pleasure. Oh how the soule by it is delighted, ravished, and even here on earth, transported for a time into a third heaven? In the second kind are knowledge, loue, feare of God, faith and delight in him, with many other. In righteousnesse, brotherly loue, patience, gentlenesse, goodnesse, and many such like, comming from the same stocke. In sobrietie, temperance in meats, and drinkes, modestie in apparell, and moderation in all bodily comforts and refreshings. Now in none of these is that soule barrē, which effectually converseth with the word of God;Tit. 2
                           •
                         11.12. 
                     For the grace of God which bringeth salvation, teacheth us to deny ungodlines and worldly lusts, and that we should liue godlily, righteousty, &amp; soberly in this present world.
                  
                  Let us descend to the particulars. 1. Peace is brought home to us by the word preached: Ephe. 2. 17. 2 Cor. 5. 19. so likewise joy instantly followes the word, and accompanies it, and enters with it into Cities, Families, and the hearts of people: see Acts 8. 8. 39. and 16. 34. Iohn 15. 11. So also for the knowledge o
                        •
                      
                     God, it comes onely from the word, and our exercising our selues in it; hence called the word of knowledge.
                     1 Cor. 12.8. Thus the Scripture of the Prophets made knowne the misterie of Christ, but much more cleerely the preaching of the Gospell: Rom. 16. 25. 26. see Iohn 17. 6. 7. 8. Thus meditation in the word teacheth us the feare of the Lord Deut. 17. 19. and 31. 12. 13. So to loue the Lord is the maine lesson, which is continually pressed upon us by the word, and which enters with it where it is effectually received: see Iohn 15. 10. so Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word.
                     Rom. 10. 17. And when we delight in the Sabboth, wee come to delight in God, Esay 58. 13. 14. Thus brotherly loue, and all the fruits proceeding from it, come by the word 1 Thes. 4.9.
Thus likewise that sobrietie and temperance in the use of the creature, is taught us by that word, and he that is taught as the truth is in Iesus, cannot liue wantonly, Ephe. 4. 19. 20. 21. So when the Gospell had a right passage in the Colossians, it was fruitfull among them, and all that heard it: see Colos. 1. 6. He that heareth and understandeth the word will be fruitfull: Mat. 13. 23. Sure it is, that every naturall cause will bring forth his ordinary effect, if it be not over-ruled by some higher power; or hindered in working by some defect in it selfe, or want of some helpe necessary to concurre with it. Now then this seed of Gods word being his power to salvation, and used by his Spirit not onely as seed, but as water, nay as fire also, to ca

                     he vertue of that which is sowen; being assisted by such an Husbandman, who both knows how to use it; and can resist all impediments, cannot but yeeld that fruit which hee intends and appoints. Esay 55. 10. 11. Iohn 15. 1. 2. The

                     e is no study but will to a man very dull (if he employ his time much in it) bring some profit: certaine therefore it is, that the heart which with delight, and continuall meditation doth exercise himselfe in that word, which God hath given to bee his wisedome, to traine us up in the right knowledge of God, and in the practice of a Christian life, will bring us, though in nature dull of hearing, and very fooles in understanding, to some good measure of knowledge, and by continuall use increase that wisdome, which it hath begun to worke in us. Psal. 19. 7. and 119.98. 99.
                  
                      2. In that the spirituall fruit is compared to the fruit of the Palme, let us especially learne in this similitude, that as the fruit of that tree is some yeares before it come to perfection, and is much longer ripening then any other: so the fruit of the Spirit doth not presently attaine to maturitie, but very often incr

                           •
                        31. 32. and yet by little and unsensible degrees it growes to wonderfull strength, even in this life: see also that parable Mark .4. 26. 27. 28. Surely the Husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth,Iam. 5.6.7. and hath long patience for it,See Gal. 5. 5. untill he receiue the former and latter raine: well therefore may we waite upon our God, &amp; expect his leasure with patience for the fruit of heaven, The Apostles had faith to forsake all and follow Christ; yet when they had long followed him, and had seene his glory in so many miracles, so powerfull preaching, nay even simple in it owne shape, and much excellence upon the mount, they had but little faith: when we heare the Prophet David after so long study in the law, still call for knowledge, and opening his eyes Psal. 119.18.27, when we see the Apostle professe,Phil. 3.13. that he had not attained, but followes hard, this truth is manifestly cleered unto us. Let none marveil at this, for we see the like in all creatures; As any is more excellent then other, and longer lived, so is he more slow in growing and attaining his perfection. Those beasts which liue but a shorter time, sooner come to ripenesse; but as man is farre beyond them, so is hee more slow of growth: and even in man we may obserue, that in the beginning, when they lived eight or nine hundred yeares, they slowly attained to ripenes and full age, and were commonly an hundred, or sixtie yeares, before they had any childrē. Gen. 5. Seing therfore this new creature is far the most excellent, &amp; of long life, even for ever and ever, we cannot wonder if it come on in some very slowly. Again as any creature receiveth &amp; digesteth more or lesse sustenance, so is it more or lesse speedy in growth: now the word of God wch 
                     is the nourishment of the new man, is both ministred and received neither in frequency or quantitie as the corporall: One meale or two a weeke, and even then we are dull of hearing: yet further, there are many impediments as in the earthly, so in the heavenly growth: without, the Fowle of the Ayre, those
cursed Spirits hind
                        •
                     ing by all meanes, and snatching like Harpies our food from our mouths: within, thornes and briars, and heart too hard at the softest. These are great impediments to our spirituall growth, but this is sure, that we shall grow; A Palme the more it is pressed, the more it will spread itselfe.
                  3. He that thus with delight meditates in Gods word  shall not onely be fruitfull in grace, but in glory also: compare Iohn 17. 8. with the 22. verse of the same chapter. The same is confirmed by all those places of Scripture, which pronounce the man blessed who heares the word of God, and keepes it: for the blessednesse of man consists in this glory, which God vouchsafeth his chosen. And although we are in some measure blessed, who in this life enjoy the favour and presence of God dwelling in them, yet could this be divid
                        •
                     d from the other, that estate were not compleatly blessed: and indeed the very end why God giues his word to man is, not to lead him some part of the way, but to bring him home to himselfe, and to goe along with him till he be perfected. Ephe. 4. 11. 13. But the perfection of man consists especially in this glorious estate; the full happinesse of man stands in being as like unto God, as his nature will permit; like in soule by a perfect holinesse, like in body by being conformed to the body of Christ. This condition wee obtaine by the word, which even here for the present begins to forme our soules to this image, and every day more, and more renewes us after the same Image.
                  
                      Lastly, see here that fulnesse of happinesse which we receiue in the new Covenant by the blood of Christ, namely that great priviledge of the faithfull, that they shall never fall from this blessed estate, into which they are entred by the word of God, but shall continu

Many such places might be alledged, but these are sufficient for those that loue the truth.
                  The foundation also of this perseverance, upon which the Spirit in the Scripture layes it, will further confirme it; For 1. it is the condition of the Covenant made in Christ: see Esay 59.21. 2. God is faithfull and upright, and able to make it good Psal. 92. 15. so Heb. 10.23. and Iohn 10. 28. 29. They must be plucked out, if ever they come out of his hands. 3. The intercession likewise of Christ, as for Peter: Luke 22. 32. so for all the faithfull, Rom. 8. 34. Now he is ever heard Ioh. 11.42. This perseverance in the new Covenant, purchased for us by the blood of Christ, is a most glorious prerogatiue of the faithfull, beyond any thing in their creation: then had they life given and immortalitie, but not setled upon them; onely promised, and that upon a condition, which they might, and soone did breake.Note, that not onely Christ wrought salvation for us, but workes us for it: 2 Cor. 5.5. and not only keepes the heritage for us, but us to it. But in this are we wonderfully happy, that God hath in Christ given and sealed to us everlasting life, which therefore cannot faile, because
it is no longer in us, but in him. Had wee chosen him, our sickle nature might soone haue repented, and gone backe: but he hath chosen us, who cannot repent. Had our life beene layd up in us, we should quickly haue lost it
                        •
                      but it is layd up with Christ in God; where no thiefe can digge through or steale, where it cannot corrupt. Looke as it is with children that are heires, yet under-age, and their parents living, they cannot bee cheated of their inheritance, nor make it away;1 Pet 1.4.5. because the right is in another;Colos. 3. 3. so the children of God haue no other right to Gods Kingdome but by Christ, and their right being in him cannot be lost. To Adam was given (saith Augustine) power to persevere if hee would,
                     
                        De correp. &amp; gra

                     but not will to doe what hee might, but to us who are grafted in by faith, is given both will and power to persevere.
                  
                  But some perhaps will say, if a man cannot fall from this grace, then although wee should shake off all feare and care of God, wee should still continue in his favour. Nay this doctrine (say the Papists, and others) opens a wide gate, and intiseth us to all sinfull libertie.
                  No such matter. For 1.Ier. 32.40. 
                     God therefore hath not given us power of continuance, that we might be without his feare; but therefore put into us his continuall feare, that we might continue. Wee could not liue in him without his feare: therefore that we might for ever liue in him, he puts such a feare into our hearts, which might wedge us fast, and bind our inconstant hearts in his Covenant: especially let us obserue, that not the gifts onely, but the very person of the holy Ghost abides with the faithfull, as an earnest of our inheritance,Ephe. 1.13. 14. untill the redemption of the purchased possession. Now the blessed Spirit is not onely to the faithfull a seale and earnest, fully to assure, and make over to them the heritage of glory, but he is there a Lieger for Christ, holding possession for him, and keeping us for him untill comming. Even as a seale in Covenant or earnest is not onely an assurance to mee of the buyars good intent &amp; meaning, but a fast bond to assure him his bargaine.
                  
                     2. Is there nothing to maintaine this godly feare but losse of glory? will onely dis-inheriting affright an ingenuous ch

To conclude, how shall he runne into all disorder, whose steppes are ordered by God? Psal. 37. 23. how shall he lose his way, whose wayes are preserved by God? Prov. 2. 8. and to whom purposely is given wisedome, and knowledge to keepe him in the good way, and to deliver him from evill wayes, and evill men.

                        Examinatiō.
                     Try we here whether we are transplanted from our natiue soile, that dry wildernesse of sinne, into the Paradise of God. They that are planted in the house of the Lord, shall flourish in the Courts of the house of our God:
                     Psal 92 12. 13. 
                     they shall bee fruitfull &amp;c. Looke now into thine heart, and consider what fruit thou findest there. Doth that peace of God rule in thy heart? Hast thou striken a covenant with the Lord? Art thou washed in the blood of the Covenant, &amp; so hast received reconciliation? This is a sure fruit of thy transplantation. But take heed least thy peace bee with Satan, &amp; thy covenant with hell: if thou art at peace with the world, and the world with thee; if thou art in league with sinne, thou hast no peace with God.
                  
                  2. See where thy joyes are seated. If thy joy haue the root in the Spirit, it is busied in spirituall objects. Obserue then what is that wch stirs up thy heart to rejoyce
                        •
                      if the loue of God to thee in Christ, if the loue of thy soule to God, if other gifts of the Spirit, if the promises of God in Christ
                     applied and brought home to thy heart by faith, this joy is a fruit of the Spirit: but if thy joy be earthly, so art thou: if thy joy sinfull, thou art no other: thou rejoycest because the world comes in upon thee, it makes thee to smile to see the world smile on thee: thou rejoycest when thou dost evill, and when thou prosperest in the evill which thou dost, thy joy is sensuall and divellish. Thus is it in the rest. Dost thou cry for knowledge? dost thou blow up thy loue to God? labouring to fasten thy soule to Christ in that feare, the bond of our covenant? Dost thou sigh and grone under the burden of unbeliefe? Dost thou stirre up thy soule to hold Christ, and rest upon him? Dost thou bring on thy soule to delight in the Lord? These are the fruits of the Spirit, the contrary certaine signes of a naturall man. So is it in those fruits of righteousnesse and sobrietle: If thou findest thy soule make on in this way, all is well: but if thou flatterest thy selfe in thy sinne, if thou livest in thy unrighteousnesse, in intemperance, thou canst not inherite the Kingdome of God.

                     1. Those are here censured, who giue no credit to this testimony of God, that by a constant delight and meditation in the word, they shall assuredly be fruitfull as well in grace, as in glory. Neither are Papists here onely to be abhorred and accursed, who revile and blaspheme this holy word, openly and commonly a

                     firming, that the reading it by ignorant men is dangerous, the way to make them heretickes, as the Rhemists say, and all the whole Rabble of them: (without feare giving the lie to the Spirit,

                         130. who testifies that it giues wisedome to the simple) Nay further write, that to giue this generall libertie to people of conversing with the Scripture is to shew our selues friends to heresie, that it is pernicious and impious. But our carelesse Professours, negligent in this duty, are here to consider their folly and hypo
                        •
                     risie, dissembling with God and man, professing that with their
mouth, which is farre from their heart: For aske them; doe you desire to be fruitfull in grace and glory? Truth will make them confesse the one
                        •
                      and shame the other: and doe you beleeue God witnessing, that by delight and meditation in the word of God you shall attaine this fruit? this they dare not deny: and why then doe you not use this meanes? why are you so negligent and averse from this practice that you cannot be drawne to it, that so many exhortations haue beene spent in vaine upon you? Is not this most grosse hypocrisie? Should a man make solemne protestation of earnest desires to doe us good; yet if some easie meanes were shewed him of doing what he promises, and he neglects them, will not every man know his former words were nothing but complement and dissembling. And is it not so with these, who affirme that they indeed desire to be fruitfull in grace, but yet when the Lord propounds so easie a way through his blessing to obtaine it, neglect this meanes, and goe on in a contrary course? Oh this is not our practice in earthly affaires and profits. The Husbandman upon hope of fruit will take sore paines and tarry long: the Merchant will venter life and goods upon likelihood of increase; Men will labour hard in studying Physicke, Law, or other Arts, by which they may reape knowledge and profit in those sciences. Had therefore thy heart received this truth of God, with as much faith as the Devils, that thou thoughtest it true, and then there were grounded in thee, a desire of this fruit, it were not possible, but thou shouldest set thy selfe to this endeavour, especially knowing the fruit is everlasting and glorious, &amp; the meanes easie and certaine.
                  
                      2. Here many of the Saints are to be reproved, whose longings make them so hastie in these fruits, that they expect a full growth, as soone as they are blossomd, or knit, that they should be ripe, before they are growne. But why doth the Lord so often, and almost continually compare them to fruits, but to teach us, that they must
haue time to grow up and ripen. Now then as he would shew no little folly, who as soone as his corne is put into the ground, expects it should presently be fit to reape: so men shew more passion, then wisedome, who are ready to repine, that the graces of Gods Spirit are not growne, and come to maturitie in them, when indeed they haue had no time for this fulnesse of growth, and are yet but newly en

                  This over-hastinesse in setting God his time for accomplishment of his promises, is presumptuous, and proceeds from unbeliefe and impatience. Faith breeds patience: we must not therefore limit the holy one of Israell,
                     Psal. 78.41. but wait upon the Lord. We our selues will make our children attend upon our leasure, especially in those gifts which are of any moment, because our experience teacheth us when it is most fit for us to bestow, and when they can best use them.Eccle. 7.11. 
                     Bee not thou therefore of an hastie spirit. But much more are those to be rebuked, who when they perceiue a man turned from his former course of life, and now to frame his heart and actions to his profession, they instantly expect an Angelicall puritie in such, and an heavenly estate without sinne or blemish. Hence is it that if they find any the least infirmitie, they presently breake out into tauntings, not onely of the person but the profession, and into revilings, no better indeed then blasphemies against the Lord, and that holy calling which themselues professe. In the meane time, like grosse hypocrites they neither doe, nor will see their notorious dissimulation and the foule deceitfulnesse of their owne hearts: for themselues liue in sinne, delight in sinne, resolue to goe on in grosse sinnes; and though there be nothing in them like a Christian, yet will they be called and counted Christians.
                  
                  3. Here are refuted and reproved Papists, and all other  ungrounded Christians, who deny the perseverance of the Saints; and affirme, that even those who by a true
faith are entred into Christ, and are now in the Covenant of grace, may yet fall backe againe, and become utter Apostates from the truth of grace which they haue received, and so finally bee damned. This errour (a rag of Pelagianisme, newly washed and worne by the Papists) confuted and condemned by the primitiue Church, and especially by that learned Saint Augustine, is so palpably contrary to this and many other Scriptures, that it cannot be defended without manifest and grosse impudence, and contradiction to Christ and his Spirit.
                  
                  But they object, to what end are those many cautions in the word:1 Cor. 10. 12. 
                     Let him that standeth take heede least hee fall. &amp;c.
                  
                  We must know for answer, that this Scripture speakes onely to such as thinke they stand; and indeed such warnings of God are not onely given, that we may know there is a possibilitie in man (as of himselfe) to fall, but for divers other ends.
                  1. Some of them are spoken not of utter or universall falling from God, or from faith, but into some sinne; no
                        •
                     
                     withstanding which fall, he may still retaine communion with God, and faith in Christ, unlesse we thinke, that every minute the Saints are out, and in with God.
                  
                  2. Such warnings are given to humble us, by knowing that not onely our lapsed nature, but even in this new life of regeneration there is a power utterly and finally to fall away
                        •
                      (much more in this, then in that state of innocency) so that our standing is onely by the Covenant of God, his mercy and truth: that we continue in this grace is not from any principle in us, but from that infallibilitie of God

                        ••
                      upholden. For when God commaunds to stand fast, he giues power to stand as he commaunds. As in the word of Creation, when the Lord commanded, Let there
bee light, there was light; so in our renovation, what hee commaunds in his Elect, he performes, and makes his word powerfull to actuate what he perswades.
                  Againe they object many passages of Scripture; They haue made shipwracke of faith, &amp;c.
                  
                  Know that in faith there are many things. 1. A knowledge and profession of the truth: 2. A consent to that doctrine; both being actions of the understanding: 3. There is an action of the will, which not onely chuseth Christ as a great blessing, (so may a reprobate, who hath set his heart upon the world) but as the supreame and onely blessednes, in whom alone without any addition, he is happy, and therefore resteth upon him, and acquieteth himselfe in the enjoying him. The other two are often called faith, and are in part (yet not without that third action of the will) that true faith, whereby wee liue in Christ: but the other separated from the last, are but the Devils faith: now this may be lost without any prejudice to this cause.
                  But further they say (as did their Predecessours the Pelagians) this is a key to open a way to all licentiousnesse.
                        Epist. Prosp. ad August.
                     
                  
                  Answer them (not onely as before in the fourth Instruction, but) 1. That there is no doctrine which crooked men may not pervert to wicked ends. 2. Deny that there is any just cause for a reasonable man to take liberty from hence of sinning. Should a weake man know, that by eating this or that meate he should not dye, but yet be grievously sicke, and lye in much and long torment; were not this sufficient to keepe him from eating it? But as hee of whom the Poets write, that was made of mortall immortall, yet subject to disease, being wounded with a poysoned dart, earnestly wished a possibility of dying; so let us know, that the stings and sorrowes, and many most smarting effects of sinne are such, that they will sufficiently fright the faithfull from falling backe, and revolting to sinne, though they know they shall not be utterly
or finally cut off from Gods favour.Rom. 6.7. Beside how shall they which are dead to sinne, liue yet therein?
                     1 Iohn 3. 3. nay where this hope is (which maketh not ashamed) there will follow a continuall purifying and cleansing from sinne.

                     Proposition 3. And whatsover he doth shall prosper.
                  In these words the Psalmist propounds the most generall part of that happinesse, which God withou
                        •
                      faile bestowes on those, who meditate with delight in his word; namely, prosperitie, amplified by the generalitie of it: Whatsoever hee doth shall prosper. Hence ariseth the third Proposition:
                  
                     
                     
                        Proposition
                     
                     Whosoever with delight meditates in Gods word, whatsoever hee doth shall prosper.
                  
                  Now there is no word which needeth explication but this of prosperitie. And prosperitie is nothing else, but that successe in our ends which we desire, and by hope expect: when therfore we purpose any action to some good end, and wee see our affaires sort to that end, or better then we hoped, then this action is said to prosper. But obserue that in prosperitie either in the whole estate of man, or in any one particular action, is required not onely the attaining some one (the immediate or middle) end, unlesse we reach to the principall and supreme. As for instance; Suppose a man sowes much, that he may reape and enjoy abundance of fruits, he desires abundance that he may rest and be merry: if now he attaines his hopes in receiving plenty, and obtaines not this rest and joy, hee cannot be said to prosper in this action. Thus that rich mans superfluitie prospered not with him Luke 12. 19.20. The Israeli
                           ••
                        
                     
                     longings satisfied abudantly, yet cannot bee said to prosper with them, Numb. 11. But if we misse of the immediate, and attaine the supreme end, our actions prosper: for he that faileth of plentie, but is filled with rest and joy, prospers in his purpose. Prosperitie therefore may be considered either absolutely in the generall, and whole estate of man, or in particular when we enjoy our hopes in some or many ends, which we desire and propound to our selues.
                  The sense then of this proposition is; Whosoever delights and meditates in the word of God, whatsoever hee setteth his hand unto shall surely haue successe, in working for him that which hee desireth and hopeth, at least in the maine and generall, if not in the lesse and particular ends.
                  
                  
                     
                        Proofe.
                     For confirmation of this point, read Iosh. 1. 8. Let not this booke of the Law depart out of thy mouth, but meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest obserue and doe according to all that is written therein; for then shalt thou make thy way prosperous, and then shalt thou haue good successe. and 1 King. 2. 3. Take heed to the charge of the Lord, to keepe his statutes and commandements, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and in every thing, whereunto thou turnest thee.
                  
                  
                     
                        Grounds.
                     The reasons or causes of this successe may be either in the word, or in God. In the word, because it points out and leads us in the way, and onely meanes of good: and is that Guide, which will direct us in the way to the end of it, if we follow it to the end.
                  
                     
                     
                        Instruction.
                     2. In God: 1. His grace and truth, whereby he purposed, promised, (and will performe it) to giue assistance and shew all favour unto such. 2. His infinite wisedome and power, ruling and over-ruling all creatures, and subduing all things to himselfe, being able, nay continually using to bring light out of darkenesse.
                  Oh! that men would learne from hence this certaine truth, that wheresoever the word of God is rightly entertained,
peace and prosperitie (as necessary attendants) surely follow it, whether into any house or Countrey. Read the historie of the Scripture, and you shall ever finde, that as long as religion was in truth maintained among any people, and the word of God set at libertie, so long that Nation prospered. Thus when Hezekiah, Vzziah, and divers other Kings were carefull to restore the truth, and to advance the faithsull Ministers of God, and settle them in their function, they prospered wonderfully: see 2 Chron. 26. 5. and 30. and 31. chapters, especially the last verse of the 31. chap: In all his workes &amp;c. hee did it with all his heart, and prospered: see also Hag. 2. 19. 20. and indeed that whole prophecie is altogether aimed to that end; namely, that the people may see their errour in neglecting Gods house, and building their owne; for all that time they prospered not: but after, when being admonished they set themselues cheerefully to build the Temple, the Lord turned his hand, and made them prosper. The whole chap: Deut. 28. is spent in this subject. But what need we travaile to forraine Nations for witnesse to this truth, when our owne Land even in our time, is a strong confirmation of it? To passe by the unspeakable miseries of this Land, since that time (wherein Popish ignorance began to creepe upon it) by Picts, Danes, Normans, and our owne civill armes: obserue but the raigne of two Sisters. The elder being a Papist, married a Popish, but a potent Prince, over-threw the Gospell, persecuted the Saints, and burned many: Shee raigned a short time, lived ingloriously, dyed in great discontent, lost her Territories, extreamly impoverished the Land, so that her Successour found neither Armour, Navie, nor any defence for the Kingdome, no not so much as any treasure to supply so many wants: Her younger Sister succeding seemed to be left as a prey to any neighbour Prince, who would first invade her. But no sooner did shee (which presently shee did) set her selfe, and imploy her Scepter to promote the Gospell, and root out

                     Poperie, but all the blessings of a Nation were powred upon her; and though shee were all alone, without any Associats, yet God made her a great helper to all her neighbours, and terrour to her enemies; insomuch, that the most potent Monarch of Christendome was utterly foiled by her, and brought into great streights and di
                        •
                     ficulties: and so palbable even to the enemie was the blessing of God, that the proud Spaniard could not refraine from upbraiding Christ, that hee was turned Lutheran. The same is Gods dealing in private with any house or person: for God is alwayes the same. And surely this is the promise of Christ, who when he sent his Ministers to preach the Gospell, commaunded them to impart peace to any Citie or house into which they entered, and assures us, that where they are rejected, it shall be more tolerable for Sodome and Gomorra: but the contrary shall follow on the contrary entertainment Luke 10. When the wayes of a man please the Lord, hee will make all his enemies at peace with him.
                     Pro. 16.7.
                  
                  
                     Iohn 14.27.But doth not Christ a
                        •
                     firme, that hee leaues not the worlds peace with the faithfull?
                  The Lord doth not there deny to giue peace, but affirmes he giues it after another manner then the world. Worldly men wish their friends prosperitie, and perhaps would, but cannot giue it; and if they doe, it lasteth a short time: but Christ giues it effectually, and keepes it to them. This text much confirmes this point: but yet further;
                  Doe we not see many true servants of God, who tremble at his word, liue not prosperously?
                  I answer: No; if we weigh well what is prosperitie, and then compare their estate with it. They liue in honour or riches; it may well be so; but honour and riches are no part of prosperiti
                        •
                     ; and but by accident, no helps toward it. For 1. They are vanitie and vexation of spirit, how then can they bee any part of prosperitie? 2,Eccles. 5. 12. 
                     Riches and honours are often reserved to their owners for
their evill. No qnestion these things are to a man, as a saile to a boat, if the saile bee too great, it sinkes the vessell, but when it is fitted in a just quantitie, then it causeth a swift and safe passage. Thus wee often see, when God giues a man riches, honour, &amp;c. in great quantitie, but not grace, and wisedome to manage this estate, they are in continuall danger by every blast to sinke into some mischiefe. Prosperitie therefore is such an estate, when all things together worke for the best: now this estate is promised by him that cannot lye, to all them that loue him Rom. 8. 28. And obserue that God alway thus worketh: Ioseph is sold into AEgypt, and made a Bond-man, but prospers in the house: is put in prison, but prospers there: is brought out unto Pharaoh, prospers with him: is preferred to great dignitie, prospers in that; and becomes a meanes to saue much flesh. Daniell is taken, carried captiue, and made a servant to an Idolatrous Prince; prospers and findes favour with the chiefe Eunuch: prospers with Nebuchadnezzar: is accused and cast into the Denne of Lyons, but prospers in all this; for all these things tend to his advantage with God and men. Yea so mightily doth God worke for them, that even sinne also through his grace workes for their good.2 Cor. 7.10. 11. Sinne workes godly sorrow, godly sorrow care &amp;c. What thankfulnesse, loue, nay labour of loue and diligence to please did the sinne of Mary Magdalen, and Paul worke in those Saints? This then is a sure truth: where the word is received with obedience, prosperitie certainely followes it.
                  
                      2. Afflictions and troubles of the faithfull, who heare and obey the word, are, if not parts, yet meanes of their prosperitie: this evidently followes from hence. For if hee prosper in all things, even afflictions shall tend to his good, and worke for him that successe which his soule wishes: for howsoever affliction (as flowing from evill, and ebbing againe into it)
of it selfe is evill, yet as it is sanctified to those who loue God, it cannot bee reckoned among evils, but rather blessings.Psal. 94. 12. 
                     Blessed is the man whom thou chastisest O Lord.

                     Rom. 5.3. 
                     Wee glory intribulation. Paul esteemes the fellowship of Christ his afflictions aboue all earthly things, so that hee accounts of all other things as dung and losse in comparison:Philip. 3. 8. 10. sorting this fellowship with the knowledge of Christ, and the vertue of his Resurrection.
                  For enlarging this point a little further, let us consider 1. What successe or good it brings in to us. 2. How being evill in it selfe, it is turned to our good.
                  It is a meanes of good, 1. by preventing evill: 2. by working out for us things profitable.
                  
                     Iob 33.19. 20
                           •
                         29. 30.It prevents destruction of body and soule; Man is chastened with paine upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong paine, so that his life abhorreth bread, and his soule daintie meate: Loe all these things worketh God with a man oftentimes, that hee may bring backe his soule from the pit, &amp;c. Thus God commaunds earthly Parents;Pro. 23.13.14 
                     With-hold not correction from the childe, if thou smite him with the rodde, hee shall not dye: Thou shalt smite him with the rodde, and shalt deliver his soule from hell: so also hee practiseth with his owne children.
                  And as it prevents destruction, so also sinne the cause of it, and keepes us from our owne wickednesse; It workes many good and profitable things in us. By afflictions wee are partakers of the holinesse of God, and this bitter roote shootes forth the pleasant fruit of righteousnesse.
                     Heb. 12. 10. 11.
                  
                  The sappe of a Crab-stocke of it selfe is sower, and distastfull: but when it is digested in a good sience, it makes the fruit so much the more pleasant. It breedes patience Rom. 5. 4. It purgeth from
sinfull evill without, and within, Prov. 20. 30. and this knew that holy Patient,
                     Iob. 23. 10. 
                     Hee tryeth mee, and I shall come forth like gold. Looke as silver and golden vessels if they gather rust, must be rubbed with something which is rough and harsh before they can be cleered; so is it with these precious vessels. It teacheth us the way of God, and putteth us into it: Psal. 119. 67. 71. and as it helpes us in all grace, so it furthers us in glory: see Mat. 5.11.12. 2 Cor. 5. 17.
                  But how comes it to be good unto us, which is so evill in it selfe?
                  1. By the over-ruling hand of God, who brings light out of darkenesse, good out of evill. 2. By the correcting nature of grace, which not onely tempers the evill, and noysome qualitie of it, but makes it medicinable and wholesome. Hence where this grace doth not over-rule the cursed nature of affliction, it brings forth murmuring, as in the Israelits, falling away more and more, Esay 1. 5. and open blaspheming, Revel. 16. 9. So that as in many Antidots the hand of a cunning Apothecary tempering some poysons, and correcting them with other ingredients, makes a most wholesome receit; so the hand of God seasoning afflictions with grace, brings them to bee of great use and profit to every Christian. But beside all this good which it brings with it, it selfe also (as sanctified) is an evident testimony of our adoption, that we belong to the Lord;Heb. 12.6.7.8 who corrects not bastards, nor suffers any child to be uncorrected. In all which respects, it may be justly accounted not onely a meanes to further and prosper us in our hopes, but not the least part of our prosperitie.
                  3. Prosperitie and successe comes not from any other cause, but from God. For howsoever it pleaseth the Lord
                      to employ and use divers gifts in man, as meanes for working successe, (as wisedome, courage, strength, diligence) yet it is he who first bestowes these gifts, and then workes by them: so that we could neither attaine
these parts whereby we worke, nor by them effect any thing without him. It is nothing therefore in man, neither in body or soule, which can bring about his hopes and purposes, but onely the Lord worketh according to his pleasure all in all things. This as it is intimated by the Psalmist, when he a
                        •
                     firmes that the man who departs from evill, delights and meditates in Gods word, shall every way prosper; so is it in many other scriptures confirmed;Deu
                           ••
                         8.17.18 
                     It is the Lord (not our owne might) which giveth us power to get wealth. The blessing of the Lord maketh rich, and hee addeth no sorrowes to it.
                     Pro. 10. 22. 
                     Honour comes not from East, West, North, or South, but God is Iudge, who maketh higb and low.
                     Psal. 75.6.7. Therefore hee promiseth these things to those who honour him,1 Sam. 2.30. with-holds them, or rather heaps on them disgrace who dishonour him. Thus even in these meaner blessings, which earthly men call &amp; account prosperity, the Lord hath the chiefe hand &amp; work, much more that true good,Gen. 39.2. (in which consisteth our onely happines) is wholy framed and ordered by him. The Lord was with Ioseph, and hee was a man that prospered;3. 23. and so palpable was this worke of God, that even his heathen Maister could not but discerne it: and the Iayler himselfe easily observed it. Now then if God causeth men to find favour in the eyes of men, as Gen. 39. 21. so that even wicked Ahab makes Obadiah, who greatly feared God, Governour of all his house 1 King. 18. 3. how much more is it hee alone, who causeth us to find favour in his owne eyes, in whose loving favour is all our happinesse?
                  
                     
                        Object.
                     But even wicked men the enemies of God, and his truth prosper.
                  Of this we shall speake more fully hereafter: for the present this may suffice;
                        Answ.
                      They obtaine many things which they ayme at; but the maine, to which they intend all the rest (namely to be happy) they never attaine, but lose all their paines and labour.
                  To conclude this point; As all good gifts come downe from the father of lights, so especially eternall life, without
which no man can be blessed, is the gift of God, Rom. 6. 23. Now therefore as a statu

                        •
                     tentation of happinesse. The Heathen are the best witnesses of this truth; Thus Dionysius the Tyrant fitly described his estate, so much praysed by his flatterer Damocles, by placing him in a chaire of state, furnishing a table with all delicates, commaunding many noble Attendants to waite on him, he had wine, musicke, and what his heart could wish; in the meane time a sword hangs over his head, held up by a weak threed, &amp; ready to fall upon him. Thus another rightly answered a flattering Courtier, who therfore accounted him happy, because he wore the Diadem, that if he knew how many cares were tyed up in it, hardly would he stoope to take it out of the durt. And surely whosoever is most enamoured on this painted happinesse, and prosperitie of wicked men, if he seriously consider what vexing cares usher it, what vanitie accompanies, and what miserie followes it, he would not a little scorne to employ any of his desires or endevours about it.

Nay even hypocrites at such times come in and approach unto him: A man in danger will catch hold of any thing, especially they will cleaue to
those whom they most trust. Thus prosperitie and blessings worke thankfulnesse: Psal. 103. 1. 2. 3. and make them study for recompence; Psal. 116. 12. In feare they cleaue to him by faith Psal. 56. 3. In griefe they seeke to him the onely Comforter. The word when it promiseth drawes them, when it threatens humbles and driues them to grace and mercy: nay even sinfull actions enforce them to God, begging pardon, and when they haue obtained it, knitting their soules to him in ardent loue: sinfull infirmities fill them with hung

Thou art faint with sicknesse; dost thou find that as the outward man perisheth, so the inward man is renewed daily? Thou enjoyest health, and other blessings: doe they worke upon thy heart to kindle more zeale to God, more loue to his name, and children? doe they quicken thee to thankfulnesse? thus doe all things worke on those whom God hath loved; at least dost thou find in generall, that though some things hinder, yet when they all meete together, they worke to the best for thee? yea even sinne it selfe makes thee 1. see thy corrupt heart and sinfull nature; 2. provokes thy loue to thy gracious Father, who pardoneth so many offences, and whets thee to all thankfulnesse, and loue of Christ who hath satisfied for thee: so that because m
                        •
                     ch is forgiven thee, thou lovest much; doth it more fill thy heart with loathing sinfull filthinesse, and thy selfe for it? awake thee to more care and watchfulnes, and lastly wearie thee with the loathsome companie of it, that thou desirest and criest to be delivered from this body of death? If thou findest these fruits, thou mayest comfort thy selfe in the Lord, for he that thus worketh for thee and in thee, hath
ordained thee to life. But if thou findest that outward prosperitie blowes up, and bladders thy heart with pride, that thou despisest God in his service, that it workes thee to more securitie and carnall libertie; if thou findest that trouble, sicknesse, &amp;c. bring forth impatience, blaspheming; or although for the present it worke a little, and by the smart of the conscience, and agonies terrifying the soule with present judgment, stirre up thy heart to promise reformation, and a better course of life, judging, and condemning thy selfe; yet upon recovery thou fallest backe againe to thy former vomit, thou art not in the number of those who feare aud loue the Lord, and for whom all things shall worke for the best.

                     1. Those blasphemers of the Gospell are here condemned, who impute evill, and the sinnes of men to the word of God, upbraiding the Professours of it in any affliction with the loue and meditation of it. Looke out and behold the wayes of men, what multitudes tread in this path? How common yet is the blasphemy of ignorant, and and wilfully blind people, who never blush to thinke, and speake it openly, that it was never a good world, since there was so much preaching; that when there was lesse preaching, then was more doing; nay even the greater ones, although their knowledg, and shame of men makes them abstaine from blasphemies so grosse and senselesse, yet they regard it in their hearts as little as the other: for they are ready to laugh at those, who in confidence of Gods truth take this course to prosper: and themselues despising this meane (appointed and blessed by God) as altogether un-effectuall, betake themselues to contrary practise, by wicked policies, bribes, fraud, oppression, &amp; such indirect and ungodly meanes to attaine their ends, and prosper in their designes.Psal, 14.6. 
                     They shame the counsell of the poore, because the Lord is his refuge. Doe not many learned in the Ministerie, despising the frequencie of preaching, neglect it in their owne practise, condemne it
in others? And can any of these from his heart beleeue this truth, so palpably delivered by the Spirit in this place, that the man is blessed who day and night meditates with delight in the word of God.
                  
                  Now as Popish ignorance in the understanding, and heathenish profanenesse in the heart, are the cause of the former, (see that example of the Israelits Ier. 44. 17. 18.) so carnall securitie and wordly wisedome joyned with much contempt of the wisedome of God, is the roote of the other. Verily even hypocrites yea grosse and palpable hypocrites, such as Herod (who as a Fox casts out stinke before him, and may be found and traced by his smell) even such can heare the word, come to it frequently, sit attentiuely, and by continuance in hearing haue their braine and understanding printed with the forme of that h

Such therefore as these, are farther off from the Kingdome of God, then the grossest hypocrite. But the truth is, that the fault why the world is so naught, is in the hearts of this people resisting the word, and shutting it out, not in the good word, which soone would make them good, if they would as well obey as heare it. Howsoever; these ignorants speake by rote of things they know not; for had they knowne the former times, and could compare them with these present, in no sence could they prefer those times before these: but it is with these men, as with unhappy boyes, which excuse their loite

                     nemies in 88, and hellish conspiracies of domesticke and natiue Traitors, beheading &amp; maiming the whol body with one blow, how haue we admired and extolled the wisdome &amp; valour of some men? how little thought or spoken of Gods mercy? how slightly regarded the strong God of our Salvation? Alas! men are so farre from this Christian practise, that they haue nothing almost in their mouthes but fortune; sometimes they prayse, sometimes they detest and curse their fortune: which either they conceiue to be a chance without the providence of God, and so set up an Idol in their hearts, and are worse then heathen; or else, to bee that hidden providence of the Lord, working beyond their power of discerning, and then who sees not how fearefully they blaspheme, and how farre they are from any shew of Christianitie.
                  
                  
                      3. Yea also many of the faithfull are here to consider and reproue their wayes: for it is too ordinary with the afflicted soule in the cloudy day to thinke: I am cast out of the sight of thine eyes. If we are a little troubled, especially
if we find some sinfull infirmitie get ground, we are ready strait to conceiue,2 Pet. 2 9. 
                     God hath forsaken us: but know, and remember God knowes how to deliver out of 
                           •
                        entation. Certainly should the Lord leaue the disposing of such things to our discretion, we should not a little hinder our owne good, and obscure his glory: Should Ioseph, Daniell, and those three royall young men haue set the time of their trouble and deliverance, how would they haue hindred both Gods, and their owne honour? The children of Israell, if they might haue shaken off the tyrannous bondage and oppression of Pharaoh at their pleasure, how should God haue beene glorified among the Heathen by all those wonders, or they confirmed in the knowledg of Gods power and providence? Follow therefore the direction of the Prophet,
                     Psal. 37. 5. 
                     Commit thy way unto the Lord, and trust in him, and hee shall bring it to passe: and of the Apostle,

Whosoever hath given up his eare and heart to God in his word, may hence draw wonderfull and unspeakable comfort, Hee shall prosper in all his wayes: and whereas he hath bent himselfe now to travaile in the search of happinesse, and to that end hath chosen this only Guide, hee shall not faile to attaine his desires and hopes, but all things shall worke for him; for hee that hath promised is true, and able to subdue all things to himselfe. Marke all the Saints, and consider Gods dealing with them in this kind. Their examples and experience will cry out unto thee;2 Chron. 20. 20. 
                     Put your trust in the Lord, and you shall bee assured, beleeue his Prophets, and you shall prosper.
                     Ier. 22.15.16. 
                     Did not thy Father eate, and drinke, and prosper, when hee executed judgement and justice, when hee judged the cause of the afflicted and poore hee prospered, was not this because hee knew mee saith the Lord? Settle this then in thy heart, the Lord promiseth, and the Lord shall make it good.

                        2.3. 
                     Take heed to the charge of the Lord, to keepe his testimonies and commandements as it is written, &amp;c. Say unto the Lord; Oh my Saviour, hast thou made thy yoake so easie, and thy commandements so farre from grievous? and shall not I take it joyfully upon me? hast thou promised prosperitie and happinesse to all that beare it? and should I refuse it? Say unto thy soule; aske and enquire of the Saints, and with one voice thou shalt heare them testifie: Thy word is more sweet then hony, more precious then all riches, more necessary then our daily food; the joy and rejoycing of their heart, a rich portion helping thee to that most rich inheritance of glory, a joyfull Guide, leading to joyes unspeakable and glorious, and shall not I cleaue unto it, that I may prosper? Let great men seeke wealth by oppression; the meaner by fraud and imposture, flatterers by fawning, Epicures by surfeiting in riot and pleasure; but oh my God I will follow thy way in thy word: looke my soule, looke unto that Guide, and depart not from his direction, and it will cause thee to prosper, and conduct thee to that eternall rest and peace, the end of all thy ends, and the onely true prosperitie.
               
            
            
               
               Psalme I. Verse iiij. The ungodly are not so, but as the chaffe which the winde driveth away.
               
                  TRue is it, that one contrary will not a little illustrate another; In colours, when blacke and white; in our estate when miserie and felicitie are compared together, their proper nature will more evidently appeare to any who will heedfully obserue it. Therefore when in the former verses the Spirit had set out the godly, both in their course and successe: in these verses he describes the condition of the wicked, that so both their estates may more cleerely bee discerned by those, who will with any diligent eye consider it: ayming both to this end, that as the happinesse of the one might allure and winne us to the same practice, so the miserie of the other might affright and driue us from the evill way. This misery of ungodly men is liuely pourtrayed, and set out to the eye from the contrary; and 1. By negation of all that blessednesse mentioned in the former verses, in which the godly are instated by the Lord, even in this
present life: 2. By a contrary curse; and that curse expressed 1. by a comparison of chaffe, 2. by the consequent and conclusion of all wicked courses in the 5. verse.
               The negatiue argument propounding the contrary estate of wicked persons, includes all these Propositions.
               
                  1. The Spirit and Prophet affirmeth, that a wicked and ungodly man is not blessed.
                  
                  2. The same Spirit concludeth, that a wicked man is not a planted and watered tree.
                  
                  3. The Prophet testifieth, that ungodly persons are not as a fruitfull tree, ever flourishing.
                  
                  4. The Lord by the Prophet assures us, that an ungodly man shall not prosper in all his wayes.
                  
               
               The first then is this;
               
                  
                  
                     Proposition
                  
                  The Spirit and Prophet affirmeth, that a wicked and ungodly man is not blessed.
               
               The words haue before beene opened sufficiently, and the meaning of them is briefly this; Whosoever delights not, nor meditates in the word, but rather with pleasure followes the counsell of ungodly persons, walking in their disobedience and scorning; neither is, nor can be happy in this estate.
               
               
                  
                     Proofe.
                  The proofe is evident, and frequently confirmed: there is no peace saith the Lord to the wicked, Esay 48. 22. and againe 57. 21. And the curse continually applied to them in Scripture.
               
                  
                     Grounds.
                  The grounds are: 1. the justice of God, who cannot by any meanes cleere the guilty, 34. 7. The Lord is knowne by the judgement which hee executeth, the wicked is snared in the worke of his owne hands; Psal. 9. 16. 17. Vpon the wicked God shall raine snares, stormes, and tempests. Psalme 11. 6.
               2. The very nature of blessednesse; for blessednesse is
that estate wherin we enjoy good without evil, or at least a measure of good out-weighing evill: but wickednesse considered of it selfe, without the punishment due to it, is to a man such an evill as weighs downe any good hee possesseth in this life: as being most cont
                     •
                  ary to his nature in which he was created, and to his end unto which he was ordained.
               
                  
                  
                     Instruction.
                  Learne here 1. That the happinesse of man consisteth not in the fruition of any one, or all outward blessings; nay some inward, and some spirituall also may be cast in to a wicked man, and hee still continue most wretched: Should riches, honour, power, glory, pleasure, bee all heaped upon one man, in that measure his owne heart desired, should wisedome, courage, health, strength, beautie, and other such endowments of body and mind be added to the other, nay the word, Sacraments, and some illightnings &amp;c. bee adjoyned, all these could not make up this blessed estate, nor seat this man in a throne of happinesse: necessarily this followes; for all these things may belong to a man drown'd in sinne and hellish wickednes, who contemnes and hates the word of God, and God himselfe, and therefore cannot bee blessed. But because this truth doth not easily sinke into flesh and blood, it will be needfull as well by evident testimonie of God to confirme it, as by reason also and experience to settle it in our mindes.
               First therefore God testifieth of these things, that they are not worthy our rejoycing.Ier. 9. 23. 24. 
                  Let not the rich man rejoyce in his riches, nor the strong man in his strength, nor the wise man in his wisedome, but let him that rejoyceth rejoyce in this, that hee under standeth and knoweth mee: where purposely the Lord chuseth out such blessings, as being of all naturall things most excellent, comprehend the rest. By riches (which are most embraced by earthly men) he intends all the goods of estate: in strength all bodily; in wisedome all gifts of the mind are included: yet in all these
we may not rejoyce or glorie, but only in the knowledge of God. Many spirituall gifts may also be annexed to the former, as some knowledge, some kinde of faith, baptisme, whereby we are entred into the Church, yet all these meeting in one man cannot giue him this happines. Simon Magus beleeved, was baptized,
                  Acts 8. 13.23. yet still was drowned in the very gall of bitternesse. No testimonie can bee of more or equall force then that of Salomon, whom God purposely called out from the sonnes of men, as the foreman of all the Iurie, to giue in his verdite concerning this truth. He was the wisest that ever lived, the Commaunder and Soveraigne of a great Kingdome, wonderfully rich, gaue his heart to pleasure, joy, and all outward blessings,Eccles. 2.3. till he might finde out that good of man. Now after he had passed through all outward good things, and had tasted the uttermost sweetnesse of them, the Lord brings him forth as the most able Iudge and witnesse, and by his mouth giues us to understand, and leaues it upon record to all ages, that they are all vanitie and vexation of spirit: and that the feare of God, and walking in his commandements is the All of man. Eccles. 2. 17. and 12. 13.
               Certainely, if any outward thing could make blessed, then as that woman in the Gospell, Blessed were it to bee the Mother of him, who is the Father of all: to beare him, who beares up all things by his mighty word; to nurse him, who nourisheth every creature. But even of this the wisedome of God a
                     •
                  firmes,Luke 11.28. 
                  that they rather are blessed, who heare the word of God and keepe it: on which words rightly builds that holy Father Augustin;
                     De sanct. virgin. cap. 3. 
                  Mary therefore was more blessed by receiving the faith of Christ, then conceiving the flesh of Christ: her motherly neerenesse had nothing profited, unlesse sh
                        •
                     e had more happily borne Christ in her heart, then in her wombe. And againe;
                     In Iohan. tract. 10. 
                  My mother whom you call happy, is therefore happie, because shee kept the word of God, not because the Word in her was made flesh.
               
               
                  Now as the Lord himselfe is a witnesse beyond all contradiction; so even reason it selfe (especially as it is setled upon confessed grounds of the word) will further convince our understanding, and inforce our judgement to witnesse this truth.
               For first, whereas it is knowne and acknowledged by all, that because the soule is immortall, and the body mortall, there must bee a double life of man, one present while the body and soule are conjoyned, another to come after that separation: whereof the former is short, a span, a vapour, appearing for a moment; the o
                     •
                  her lasting and everlasting: and againe, that both of these haue certaine peculiar blessings annexed, which make that estate comfortable and pleasant; it cannot be denied but that these fading things perishing in the use, can by no meanes helpe us in that other estate, which is for ever: and howsoever they may bee some poore comforts and refreshings to this momentarie life, yet to that other they are altogether dead. Now as wee neither doe, nor can account that man rich, who dwels in a faire house, but yet a Farme; hath much cattell, money, and goods, but another mans; and at the yeares end must bee turned out naked without a ragge to his backe: so all these temporall blessings cannot make us happy, because howsoever we haue a short use of them, yet it is manifest that as we came in, so shall we goe out of the world naked, and stript of all earthly goods: and not onely the things themselues,Psal. 146.4
                        •
                     
                   but all our thoughts about them peris
                     •
                   utterly.
               Secondly; Those things cannot of themselues blesse us, which unlesse they are blessed by some other, fill us with curses and bring us to destruction. But thus is it with all these,1 Tim. 4. 4.5. 
                  they are sanctified by the word and by prayer: and againe,Tit. 1. 15. 
                  To the pure all things are pure, but nothing pure to them that are d
                        •
                     filed and unbeleeving.
                  Eccles. 5.12. Doe not wee see by experience 
                     •
                  hat riches turne to the hurt of the owner; see also Prov. 1.19
                     •
                   Consider it exemplified in that wicked

                  Ahab, and Naboths vineyard 1 King. 21. Thus also honour to those who by want of grace dishonour God, is a burden which presseth them body and soule to utter ruine, as wee see in Ieroboam and all his Successours. So we finde that strength, beautie, health worke to the destruction of the owners by intemperance, wantonesse, murthers, oppressions: nay even wisedome it se
                     •
                  e in Achitophel wrought to the ruine of himselfe and many others.
               Lastly; Those things cannot make a man happy, which neither are any part of our supreame good, nor yet singly or joyntly of themselues any helpers to advance him to that highest good, unto which he is created. But all these things are no other. For first they are all desired for some farther end, and no man doth or can rest in them: and the highest good is the divine and glorious conformitie to God, which is not helped forward by any of these. Earthly riches are commonly snares to inveagle and entice us from him; but of themselues neither they, nor any such as th
                     •
                  y, helpe us to enjoy him: onely as they are sanctified by grace and over-ruled by it, they giue some opportunitie to expresse our loue to him in his Saints.1 Cor. 1. 20. Even our wisedome in this case is folly and enmitie, and must bee utterly cast out,Rom. 8.7. and wee become fooles,
                  1 Cor. 3. 18. before wee can enter into this estate. Thus both God himselfe, and our reason also will readily testifie unto us, that there is no happinesse in any outward blessing.
               
                   2. Learne we here what is the most and onely accursed, odious thing, which makes a man miserable. There is nothing but sinne and wickednesse which can bring the curse and miserie upon man. Sinne is the breach of Gods Law:Gal. 3. 10. and cursed is every man which continueth not in all things which are written in the booke of the Law to doe them. And whereas miserie consists in the deprivation of good things, and pressure of evill, evident is it,
that sinne of it selfe is a meere privation of all true good belonging to man, and the greatest evill that is or can bee to him. For that good of man, which enobles him aboue the common ranke of ordinary creatures, is holinesse and righteousnesse, that image of God in which we were created: now sinne is the privation of holinesse, as darkenes of light. Doe but consider what is the excellence of man exalting him aboue other creatures. Other creatures haue strength and continuance, as stones; some haue life, as trees; some a soule, sense, and motion, as beasts; some singular understanding and knowledge, as Devils: yet a man may excell them all: if his excellencie stood in strength and durance, the very stones went beyond him: if in life, many trees would justly claime prioritie: if in sense, dogges, eagles, apes, yea spiders were more eminent; if in understanding, he were inferiour and worse then those cursed spirits, the worst of creatures: yet the faithfull apparantly excell all these; there is nothing therfore but holinesse whereby he out-goes other creatures. Now sinne is the privation of this holinesse; nay not only a meere privation, (as darkenesse of light) but a de
                  
                     •
                  truction, as ruine, of an house, or death, of life. Againe, sinne it selfe is the greatest evill, the most filthy and detestable evill of all the world: the abominable thing which God hates Ier. 44. 4. continually therefore compared by God to things most abhorred; to clutterd bloud, to mire and mud, to a vomite: so loathsome, that if it were possible fully to eye the filthinesse of it, it would infinitely, amaze and affright us. Certainely when in our measure we are enabled by the Spirit with open eyes to behold it, we loath and abhorre it, and our selues for it, Ezek. 36. 31. Iob 42. 6.
               But in nothing may wee more cleerely perceiue the horrour of sinne, then in that comparison so often us
                     •
                  d by the Spirit, where this spirituall death is resembled to the bodily,Rom. 
                        •
                     . 24. and called the body of death. For looke as a
living body graced with fit proportions, and naturall colours,Rom. 7.24. full of spirit, is an amiable and louely object to a bodily eye, which yet when the soule is departed, and hath beene some little time in the graue, is a lothsome fight, so that they, who before doted on it, now tremble to behold it: so where the blessed Spirit quickens the soule of man, and fils it with the life and beautie of God, how glorious how ravishing is this sight to a spirituall eye? but when the spirit of man lies dead in sinne, buried in lust, what can it differ from a Devill incarnate? neither is it only in it selfe very evill, but a fountain streaming forth all manner of evils. First, it remoues all good things; as 1. the fountaine of all good, God himselfe: 2. all those blessings which flow from him: as temporall Ier. 5.25. Esay 24. 5.Esay 59.2. spirituall as was evident before, yea eternall Rom. 3. 23. Secondly it heapes on us all evill, death of the body and all the sorrowes which attend it. Rom. 5.12 Lam. 3. 39. But in nothing more evidently appeares the cursed and filthy nature of sinne, then in the infection of it, and meanes to purge it: the contagion of it spread into the whole generation of man, and one sinne committed by one hath brought forth a world of sinne and sinfull men, that the very foundations and originalls of mans generation are uncleane, and make every one uncleane that toucheth them; it defiles our very prayers &amp; maketh them odious. Pro. 15. 8. and 28.9. and turnes a Saint, nay an Angell into a Devill. Againe no other meanes to purge it but the blood of Christ,
                  Levit. 15. and that applied by no other hand but of the Spirit.
               
               But some will say 
                     •
                   sinfull men neither see nor feele any such miserie: they liue merrily and in all jollitie.
               That they neither see nor feele is it any marvaile: for first they haue no eyes to see: Deut. 29. 4. nor sense to feele Ephe. 4. 19. 2. To a corrupted tast sinne is as a sweete poyson, pleasant in the mouth, but in the stomack deadly: it is as riotous spending, which is not felt instantly,
but with delight; yet in time presseth, and breaketh our backs with debt. 3. As those herbes of Sardi which killed with laughing: so sinne doth not onely with griefe and torment bring men to destruction, but with mirth and dancing. Lastly, in a naturall heart sinne is in its natiue countrey, and naturall place; now a stranger is soone observed, but natiues seldome regarded: nothing is burthen some in its owne place: a little water in a vessell will soone wearie us, but a whole River when we are in the midst of it, and under it, is no load. But if wee obserue the faithfull, we shall soone perceiue, that although very little of this sinfull filthinesse remaine in them (in comparison of others) y
                     •
                  t doe they see it with much griefe, and feele it with extreme loathing: as Psal. 38. 3. 4. 5.
               
                   3. Every wicked man is a most cursed creature, and a miserable wretch. Thus truth as it evidently appeares from the text, and that which hath beene spoken of it, so it will more cleerely shine in many other evident testimonies and grounds drawne from the word of God, and our reason.
               
                  1 Pet. 2. 14.Thus are they called the children of the curse, and the children of wrath:
                  Ephe. 2.3. Read Deut. 28. from the 15. verse to the end.Rom. 3.16. 
                  Revel. 3. 17. Destruction and calamitie is in their wayes.
               
               For our reason, as it confesseth there is a soule, so can it not deny, but that the losse of it, though with the gaine of a world is a great miserie. Now every wicked man wilfully looseth his soule, and casteth it into utter perdition:Rom. 6.23. 
                  for the reward of sinne is death. 2. What estate can bee more miserable and cursed, then to bee delivered up to the power of such an enemy, who mortally hates us, and with all his might seekes our utter destruction: But every sinfull man is in the possession of Satan, to be kept in chaines of darknesse to everlasting perdition:Ephe. 2. 2. he rules in them, and wholy swayes and carries them with greedinesse
to torment of body and soule without end or intermission. Nay even without the word, our reason will acknowledge the wicked man, the onely miserable man; For even Heathens haue concluded, that no man can bee happy before his death, and how should a wicked man bee happy after death? Even the best of his life is spent in vanitie and much vexation of spirit, and is continually subject to many other evils, so especially to the feare of death: his greatest pleasures are soone loathsome, and (as the Bee) hony in the thigh, a sting in the taile: Doth hee fill himselfe with choice of dainties and rich wine? it breedes head-ach, cruditie in the stomacke, and at length scorning the greatest rarities. Is he seated high? the more is he subject to all blasts of envie, of those that are under him, and lightnings of those that are aboue him. Is hee rich? what misery to get it? what feare to lose it? what griefe to forgoe it? To conclude; If a wicked man bee poore and bare in this life, no man will say he is happy: if hee be rich and liues in pleasures, so much more obnoxious is he to all misery: the losse of all such things being certaine, and the time uncertaine when we shall loose them.
               
                  
                     Object.
                  But their condition seemeth altogether contrary.
               
                  
                     Answ.1. It doth not seeme so to those who with the light of the Sanctuary looke upon th
                        •
                     m Psal. 73. 17. no not to the eye of reason, for naturall men haue seene, and confest their miserie. 2. Things are not alwayes as they seeme. A man noble in birth, great in possessions, brauely attended, and faring highly, but guiltie of treason, may seeme a happy man to a foole, but wise and understanding men know well that he is in a miserable condition.
               
                  
                  
                     Reproofe.
                  1. Now then if thou find this folly in thee, so common among men, to seeke and esteeme earthly things as those chiefe blessings in which consisteth our happinesse, checke and chide it, and thy selfe for entertaining it: Surely if Christian r
                     •
                  ligion had not taught men their folly,
and spirituall wisedome made them see their errour, yet the common understanding of a reasonable creature, and the mistresse of fooles, (as some call experience) would discover how vaine and senselesse is their opinion and practice. For how should that giue us rest, which is never at a stay in it selfe, but ever ebbing and flowing? How happens it that when these things increase, thou findest thy selfe no happier then before? why dost thou call him (and miscallest him not) a miserable man, who by base sparing treasures up abundance of earthly riches? Oh that wee would open our eyes! Are not our hearts held with strong witcherie while wee thus dote? The Apostle affirmes them bewitched,Gal. 3. 1. who forsake the Gospell to follow the Law: But is not he farre deeper in this errour, who forsakes God for Mammon, Christ for the world, and in the meane time profe
                     •
                  seth himselfe a Christian? The Ethike and Ethnike Philosopher fitly describes the nature of these things, when he compares them to instruments and tooles of an Artificer: which, if they are too little are of no use, if too big are a burthen. Certainly it is not in vaine that the Wiseman prayeth as well against riches, as povertie, for he plainly discerned, that without sanctifying grace, povertie doth not more easily driue to unlawfull courses, to impatience and stealing, then doe riches to pride, presumption, and securitie. Even Heathens taught onely in the schoole of nature, shall condemne Christians; for I never heard of a learned Heathen, no not the Epicure, who shamed not to place his happinesse in things meere earthly.
               But some will say; God forbid, that we should seate our happinesse on earth, or any thing on earth: nay wee know well that there is no happines but in heaven with Christ,
                  Colos. 3.3. for our life is hid with Christ in God.
               
               Now if our actions did answer our words, all were well: But if this were true, how is it that all our cares and endeavours with so full a streame empty themselues into this world, and so little of our labour, or rather none
at all runnes this way? If Christ be our life, why is not our heart with him? to loue him, desire him, and long for him? how is it possible we should be coldly affected to those meanes which bring us to him, and knit our soules in union with him? men will ride &amp; run through ill wayes &amp; weather to Faires and Markets, wher they haue any hope, though no assurance, to meete with a good bargaine: but is there in them any such earnestnesse in matters concerning their eternall life? God hath appointed his Sabboths as Faires and Market-dayes,Esay 55.1. and proclaimes them: Hoe every one, come, and buy, you that haue no silver, &amp;c. here is assurance of spirituall profit, but men will not steppe out of doores to it.Esay 30.9. Are they not then lying children? open dissemblers with God and men, when they will be called Christians, professe their life is with Christ, and that here (as all the Saints) they are but strangers, and sojourners? Know assuredly, that hee which is indeed a member of Christ, thirsts &amp; longs for him with great vehemence:
                  Psal. 84. 2. and therefore longs for his Ordinances, and is even faint for them. And as the faithfull desire him, so doe they waite and seeke for him in his wayes.
                  Esay 26. 8 9. Remember then, that neither this estimation, nor pursuit of temporall things which wee see ordinarily in the world, can stand with a Christian profession.
               
                   2. Sharpely must that wilfull and miserable blindnesse of carnall men be rebuked, who neither discerne any beautie in holinesse, nor any filthinesse in sinne; How wretched is their estate who haue faire bodily eyes, able and quicke to perceiue, and with delight to view a corporall beautie, with loathing to avoid bodily deformities, but are blind in spirit, and take no pleasure to behold the louely image of God in holinesse, neither learne to abhorre the pollution of soule and body, whereby sinne deformes and defaces them. Surely as the person of our Saviour, so much more that image of his in holinesse findes no favour in a carnall eye, they see no forme in it, why it should bee desired. As Amnon, thou canst view the flower
of grasse (fleshly beautie) and admire it, it ravisheth thy eye, enflameth thy heart, thou canst sue, wooe, pine for it; but that beautie of heaven in the face of Christ, more bright then the Sunne, darting the beames of it into a gracious heart, and thence reflected, and brightly shining in holy actions, we regard not. A wry mouth, a squint eye, a splay foot, a blacke and sootie skinne we abhorre; but the distortion of sinne, a filthy tongue, an envious eye, an evill affection, and the very image of Satan in hellish darkenesse never troubles us. Whence is this, God hath not given us an eye see unto to this day.
                  Deut. 29.4. Oh if a gracious heart is ravished with the beautie of those feete which bring the Gospell:Rom. 10. 15. what kinde of heart hast thou, which is not moved with the very face of Christ, shining in his owne holy example, and in the practise of his Saints? If the faithfull complaine of pollution, not onely in themselues but in their righteousnesse,Esay 64. 6. 
                  Wee haue all beene as an uncleane thing, and all our righteousnesse as filthy clouts: where are thine eyes, w
                     •
                  o canst see no filthinesse in thy heart, and practice over-growne with all wickednesse, no nor in thy sinne and rebellion? But if this want of heavenly light be fearefull, what then is hellish darkenesse and eye of the Devill, whereby men see such louelinesse in sinne, and esteeme nothing so pleasant and amiable as an uncontrouled course in lusts? verily they are nightbirds, that can discerne no light but in darkenesse. The bodily eye abhorres the Devill in any shape, (should he appeare as an Angell of light) if he were knowne: but the soules of men delight
                     •
                   in all his uglines; for let him dresse himselfe in sinne which is his onely deformitie, he is most welcome and 
                     •
                  it for their companie. If Satan offers himselfe to a drunkard in his pots, he goes downe merrily; If he appeares to a covetous person in the shape of gaine, nothing more welcome; If he lookes on a wanton in a louely eye, how amiable is he? nay let him come in his owne shape to a malicious man, cluttered in blood, as a murtherer from the beginning (and shewes himselfe in his
owne colours) which is the very shape of the Devill, he is entertained greedily. Certainely even witches themselues seeme better then these, who desire not the companie of Satan but in the shape of their familiars, but these men like him in his most natiue and uglie forme. Surely as in povertie, nakednesse, and such like evills, madnesse whereby men haue no sense of them, is rather an addition then a remedie; so when we are spiritually poore and naked, it is a great weight added to our miserie, that we are altogether blind, and discerne neither any filthinesse in our estate, nor goodnesse in the contrary. Oh therefore if thou esteemest it as a joyfull and happy condition, that without checke thou canst delight in drunken fellowship: if thou canst blesse thy selfe in thy unlawfull courses, and despising in thy heart (as thou countest it) the miserable condition of those, who calling him Father, that without respect of persons judgeth according to every mans worke, passe their time here in feare (1 Pet. 1. 17.) applaudest thy selfe as the onely happy man, who followest thy lusts in all their commaunds, know thou art in a spirituall phrensie: Satan hath gotten possession of thy heart, and holds thine eyes that thou should not see, nor seeke salvation.
               
                   3. That strange senslesnes of heart is here fearefully noted, and to be taxed in men which feele no burthen nor load of sin, which is a plaine evidence that they are dead in it, and liue to it. A dead man feeles not the earth that lies upon him, nor the many wormes which gnaw his flesh; but a lesse waight presseth a living man, and one worme be it in the tooth, or any part, torments him. Hence is it that they count those blessed who are proud, and them that worke wickednesse, and such as tempt God:Mal. 3.15. for looking only on things present, and considering even them onely by their sense, they are ready to condemne the generation of Gods children, as being often under the rod, and to magnifie their owne estate, and others like themselues who liue at ease. But had they ever beene in the Sanctuary of

                  God, and there beheld the end of these men, they would soone change their thoughts. How suddenly are they destroyed, perished, and horribly consumed?
                  Psal. 73. 19. True it is, that the wicked can discerne the death of the righteous to bee happy,Numb. 23.10. and can wish it, but he will not see his life to be so; the reason is, because he liues to sinne, and knowes not the life of righteousnesse; and hence though a legion of Devils possesse his heart, and bursting all bonds of pietie carries him headlong into destruction, yet hee feeles no miserie in all this. Doe we thinke that a swearers or cursers mouth is not inhabited with a devill of blasphemie? Doth not an uncleane spirit dwell in wanton and adulterous eyes? Is not the throat of a drunkard held by a Devill of excesse and surfeting? Doth not a Devill of profanenesse possesse thy heart, when thou neglectest God in his Ordinances? a Devill of pride keepes the soule of him which is filled with despising of God and man, jesting, mocking, and skoffing at religion, and even at God himselfe in it? Doe but obserue the difference of men. Some feele a great burthen of sinne, and cry out of it Psal. 38. 4. some feele a great burthen in the law of God, and cast it from them Psal. 2. 3. some feele the yoake of Christ sweet and pleasant, and are wonderfully delighted in the word of God: others find the service of sinne delightfull, full of pleasure and sweetnesse, and are carried headlong in it: some thirst for the Lord, his righteousnesse, and the meanes which bring them to it; Others long to fulfill their lusts, and drinke iniquitie like water. Now how easily may we here see what is the reason of all this: They are two differing, nay contrary creatures, the one light, the other darkenesse, the one dead, the other living: the one all earthly, the other heavenly, the one flesh, the other spirit.
               
                  
                  
                     Exhortation.
                  3. Hearken therefore to those frequent invitations: Let the wicked forsake his way. Cast away from you all transgressions,
                  Ier. 18. 11. 
                  Ezeck. 18. 31. Let not sinne raigne in your
mortall body that you should obey it in the lusts thereof, Rom. 6. 12. And consider 1. that the wrath of God is revealed from heaven upon all ungodlinesse Rom. 1. 18. so that though hand joyne in hand the wicked shall not goe unpunished.
                  Pro. 11.21. Againe, thou canst not possibly obtaine what thou seekest, that is happines, so long as this companion is with thee: A man cannot bee established by wickednesse;Pro. 12. 3. for our wickednesse shall correct us,
                  Ier. 2.19. 
                  and our backe-slidings shall reproue us: but every man shall eate the fruit of his owne way, and be filled with his owne devices:Pro. 1.31. 32. for even ease slayeth the foolish, and his prosperitie is his destruction.
               
               
                  
                     Proposition 2.
                  The second Proposition in this verse is;
                  
                     
                        
                        
                           Proposition
                        The Spirit affirmes the wicked not to bee as a tree planted by the rivers of water.
                  
                  The words haue beene opened before: verily in nothing doth the Palme resemble a wicked person, but their contrarietie is evident. The one is ever, the other never fruitfull; the one flourishes, the other perishes in winter; the one thirsteth after living springs, the other abhorres the waters of life.
                  For proofe of this point,
                        Proofe.
                      although very cleere in it selfe, and frequently confirmed, read Ier. 17. 5. 6.
                  And in testimonies the grounds must be,
                        Grounds.
                      first the truth of the matter: and loue of the truth in the speaker. Now the holy Ghost is the Spirit of truth, who infallibly knowes and constantly testifies all truth:Iohn 15.26. &amp; 16. 13. especially being sent by the Father and the Sonne to beare witnesse of the truth, and to lead us into all truth.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                        Instruction.
                     1. Seing wee are here taught, that wicked men continuing in their sinfull estate, are not transplanted, nor gra
                        •
                     
                     ted, but still remaine in the old soile of the earthly Adam,
                     and in their wild Olive: we may thence learne, that no wicked man hath any right or claime to Christ, nor any benefit from his resurrection, death, intercession, or any other his workes to salvation, so farre forth as he is such, and so continues. The faithfull and godly are transplanted into the house of God, grafted into Christ, and from him draw the nourishment of eternall life, that precious sap springing from his death, and killing sinne in them, so also from his resurrection quickning and strengthning them in the life of God. But the wicked not so. Therefore our Saviour excludes them from his prayers, and confineth the fruit of his death to his sheepe:Iohn .17.9. Iohn 10. 15. Iohn 17.19. 
                     Hee sanctified himselfe for them, which are sanctified by the word. He came indeed to be a Saviour, but to his owne people: Mat. 1. 21. see also Iohn 8. 21. 23. 24
                        •
                     
                  
                  Sense, reason, and experience will confirme this. For first it is apparant to sense, that as a tree drawes no juice from any soile but that onely in which it is rooted, nor a twig can haue other sap, then that which it receiues from the roote, to which it is united: so worldly wicked men, being still rooted and defixed in the world, and being not united to Christ by faith, nor transplanted into the house of God, can haue no other affections or actions then are in the wicked world: they cannot haue that life which springs from Christ alone. Againe even reason will confirme it. For when through the intercession of some speciall Favourite, satisfaction is received, and pardon proclaimed to all, who renowncing their rebellion, and laying downe their armes, come in, acknowledge their fault, submit themselues, and giue their oath of allegiance; those haue no benefit of this pardon who performe not these conditions, but continue in their treason: thus our reason will assure us; that the faithfull, and they only, turning from sinne, and subjecting themselues to the word, haue benefit from the death, life, and intercession of Christ. And will not our experience also testifie it? For what fruit hath he of Christs death, whom wee see
liue to sinne? Rom. 6. 2. 7. 8. what benefit of his resurrection, who hath no life of the Spirit? what good by his intercession, which are condemned with the world? see Psal. 9. 17.
                  
                      2 Againe in that a wicked man is not as a tree planted by the rivers of water, nourished by that moisture of life in the word, learne here, that the word of God doth not profit the vnfaithfull, and wilfull sinners, such as go on in their sin. They may hear, know, and vnderstand what is spoken, be able to discourse of it, and dispute by it, but it brings home no life to them, no saving grace.Heb. 4.2. 
                     The word doth not profite them because it is not mixed with faith. Looke as in earthly treasure, we may see great summes, heare the ring of it, see it told out, know the worth, and quantitie of it, nay hold it in our hands, and carry it to others, yet be no whit the richer by it, unles we own it our selves, and purse it vp to our owne use: so in the riches of the Gospel, wicked persons may hear, read, discern the particulars, and excellencie of it, convey it to others, and be themselues poore, and naked. Men may fit at table, see much varietie of meate, smell it, know the sweetnes of it, tast the goodnesse of it, but if they doe not swallow, reteyne, and digest it, it profits nothing. Thus many sit as the people of God, have some savour, and smacke of some grace, tast the good word, but casting it out againe, and not incorporating it into their soules by an unfained faith, &amp; through obedience, it doth them no good. So in that parable, where the Lord compareth the word to seede,Luke 8. the wicked are resembled to such grounds, as are either stony, and resist it; or haunted with ravenous fowles which devoure it, or over-runne with thornes and briars which choake it. And as moisture is sucked and drawne in by the rootes of tr
                        •
                     es pl
                        •
                     nted by the rivers, but a stone though whelmed in water, yet is wet onely in the superficies or out-side, but within is as before it was; so the heart which is prepared for
the word, drinkes in this water of life, prospers, flourishes, and growes fruitfull by it, but a wicked man though hee may seeme to haue his out-side washed by it, yet it never sinkes into his heart, nor soakes into him.
                  The reasons of this are manifest. 1. There is no passage for the word to enter into the hearts of wicked men; an hard fore-skinne stops up the doo
                        •
                     e, that the word should not get in: see Ier. 6. 10. Their eares are uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken; in which respect that phrase of boaring the eare is used by this Prophet Psal. 40. 6. There is a deadly feod and open warre betwixt the word and the wicked. It will not spare them, nor they it; it is a word to wound, a mighty weapon to subdue them, accuses, reproches, vexes them; they abuse, reject and slander it: hence the Minister is of all other most hated and opposed by them, reviled, and contemptuously abused and abased. Compare Ier. 15. 10. with 18. 18. Nay the word is so farre from bringing them life, that it hurts and kills not of it selfe, but through their default;2 Pet. 3.16. 
                     They pervert it to their owne destruction. For as good meate breedes good nourishment in a good, but noisome humours in an ill stomacke; so the word is the savour of life to the Elect, b
                        •
                     t to others the savour of death. When a pipe lies in a cleere fountaine, it carries along the pure waters to the cisterne, which thence are distributed to every office i
                        •
                      the house: so a sanctified eare conveyes the word to the heart, which thence is sent forth into every action. But, as when wholesome water is brought into a filthy pit, the stinking slime infects it with a noysome and poysoning qualitie: so when that pure and precious word, the water of life, enters into a wicked and rebellious eare, it proues deadly, (and as Physicke that never worketh) the destruction of him, who taking it into his understanding resists it, and suffers it not to worke upon the will and affections: see Ezek. 47. 11. The raine which falleth from heaven, and watereth the earth, bringeth out both good seed and weed with it, so
the word doth not onely nourish good things, that are planted in us, but accidentally through the perversnes of men (sometimes their mis-construing, sometimes their opposition, lusting against it) produceth their filthinesse, and consequently worketh their perdition.
                  
                     
                     
                        Reproofe.
                     1. Now heere is fit occasion to rebuke that presumptuous conceit of wicked persons: who being still naturall men, and in nothing changed from their first estate, yet make full account to finde mercie in Christ, and never question, nor indeed try their hopes of salvation by him. God forbid (say they) that every ignorant person should be damned.
                  
                     God is more mercifull then so, more gracious, then you would make us beleeue. True it is, God is more gracious &amp; mercifull then either we can utter, or they conceiue. And that his infinite grace hath he especially declared in that wonderfull expression of it,Iohn 3. 16. 
                     giving his sonne to sinfull man, that whosoever beleeveth in him, should not perish but have life everlasting. But his mercies are not disposed according to mensfansies: but according to his owne will, and wisdome. And he hath su

                     ned this dispensation of his grace, that all men might take notice of it. True also that God hath given Christ; but onely to beleevers, neither ha
                        •
                     h any man any interest in him, or right to that attonement made by him, but onely by faith in him; Christ is receiued by faith Iohn. 1. 12. and continues in us by faith, Ephe. 3. 17. therefore by faith in him we have life, Gal. 2. 20. and whosoever giues not him that obedience of faith shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him, Iohn. 3. 36. But knowledge must goe before faith, and obedience will surely follow it: we cannot beleeue what wee know not, therefore hearing is necessary: and not every hearing, but hearing Gods word preached by his messengers, makes Christ knowne to us, and so works faith. Knowledge is the first step to eternall life,Iohn 17. 3. so that we are strangers
to the life of God through ignorance Ephe. 4. 18 For how should Christ, who is light, haue fellowship with darknesse, and not expell it? And obedience doth infallibly attend this saving faith; called therefore the obedience of faith. Rom. 1. 5. and 16. 26. see also Rom. 6. 17. Hence salvation in Christ is onely given unto those, who obey him. Heb. 5.9. and the ignorant, and disobedient utterly cut off from all hope 2. Thes. 1.9. Certaine also is it, that God offers grace to sinners; nay gives eternall life to sinners, and promiseth pardon of sinne, but onely to those who take hold of these offers, and turne away from sinne by repentance, forsaking the world, and their owne wayes, and cleaving to the Lord, walking before him in all uprightnesse, and holinesse: but utterly denies his mercie to all such, as neglecting his offers of grace, refuse to turne, and to be purged from their, filthinesse. The 18 Chap. of Ezek: is wholy spent in this subiect: especially observe the 20. 21. 22. 23. 30. 31. verses of that Chap: so also Ezek. 24. 13. Deut. 29. 20 Exod. 34.7.
                  
                      2. Here may we consider, and judge our great unprofitablenesse. Surely the very elect, and faithfull, and he that is among them the best proficient, will soonest, and with most griefe acknowledg, that when hee hath done all, hee is an unprofitable servant. Luk. 17. 10. For when he considers the lively, and quickning power of that immortall seede, the labour of Gods husbandmen, nay of that great Husbandman him selfe, the dewes, and seasonable waterings of his holy Spirit, the long time he hath beene under this tillage, and compares with these the little fruit, which he hath brought forth, he will soone discover, and with great sorrow lament his barren heart, and acknowledge the cursed soile of his unfruitfull soule: yet may wee comfort our selves in that promise of Christ, that where ther is any true fruit,Iohn 15. 2. that branch shall not be cut off, but purged that
it may bring forth more fruit. But how wofull is their condition, who when they have long enioyed those holy ordinances of God, continue still unmoved from their first estate, and will be no other, then they were at first: How did the word finde them? ignorant of their dutie to God, and men, themselues, and others. And how are they now? more ignorant, and carelesse then ever, wilfully blinde, and walking, even desperately reiecting the light, which is offered unto them.
                  Oh! that we would consider our owne wayes in our hearts. Doe wee now give up our selves to the service of Christ, in setting out some time for private prayer, and meditating in the word of God, more conscionably obserue the Sabboth, and the times, and places of publik prayer, and hearing the word? Doe wee now learne to detest intemperancie, and weyn our selues from excesse? Haue the poore learned of the Apostle, let him that stole steale no more?
                     Ephe. 4 28. Are the rich instructed that they trust not in uncertaine riches, but in the living God?
                     1 Tim. 6. 17. In a word, haue wee learned to speake every one the truth to his neighbour? to thinke and speake the best? to blesse, to doe good, and that for evill? Alas where doe these fruits appeare? Now br
                        •
                     
                     thren, doe not wee know, and professe the necessitie of these duties? Hath not the word plainely discover'd them to us? and even broke open our shut eyes, that wee could not but discerne them? and yet what are wee the better in our practise then before? Remember the parable of the fig-tree. Luk. 13. 6. &amp;c. Well may it bee, that the Lord will a little longer continue this meanes of salvation unto us; the word of his grace; but if wee continue in our barrennesse, hee will certainly cut off such unprofitable branches,Iohn 15. 2. and not suffer his Church to bee encumbred with us. But how deadly, and desperate is their estate, who grow
worse and worse? who turne the grace of God to wantonnesse, and pervert the Gospell to their confusion, more sharpning themselues to every evill way? The more meanes is used, the more they fall off Esa. 1. 4. 5. and Ier. 9. 3. see the threatning which followes. Certainely this is the condition of very many: They grow every day more shamelesse, and open in the
                        •
                     r sinnes. Drunknesse, and that which followes it, whoredome, nay blaspheming God, despising men after Gods image, lies, slanders, fraud, oppression, and all manner of wickednesse increaseth, and what can insue but destruction of soule, and body? bee not deceived thy selfe wilt not indure a ground, which after much cost, &amp; labour brings forth nothing but beggerie. Read therefore, and remember, and lay to heart what that great Husbandman hath determined concerning such grounds Heb. 6. 8.
                  
                      3. Those foolish men are here condemned, who haue in some measure

                     eene, and tasted the sweetnesse of the word, and yet doe not constantly converse with it. They can sometimes take a walke by this rivers side, but though they perceiue it a situation of great pleasure, and more profit, they cannot bee perswaded to leaue their old habitation to plant, and seat themselves by it. Many are like great men, who haue summer, and winter houses, and retire to them in their seasons. While the storme lasteth, and the clowdy day filles their habitation with griefe, and feare, then they can retire to this rock, and hide themselves under the covert of the word. But if once they see the world smile againe upon them, and the darke cloud blowne over, they returne to the world, where they haue seated all their affections.
                  Verily as some men (who seeme ridiculous to the wise) though they haue found neither health, wealth, nor pleasure in their dwelling, yet are wedded, and even glued to it, as being the place of
their birth, and the house of their Ancestours: so wee may see men besotted in the world, and still cleaving to it, not because they finde any reall delight, profit, or content in it; nay they see every day more vanitie in their labour, more trouble and vexation grow on them, but they are borne and bred in it, and the custome of their Fore-fathers carrieth them downe in the streame of worldlinesse.
                  Looke into the historie of the old Testament, and wee shall finde, that while Gods people claue unto this word, and departed not from it so long they prospered, and enjoyed all the blessings of a Nation; but when they despised this word, and rejected it, many afflictions and troubles consumed them; and when they finally persisted in the contempt of it, they utterly perished and were confounded.

                        Exhortation
                     Let us seat our soules by these waters of life; bee not foolish: consider that the wisedome of God calleth thee as fast to this dutie, as thine owne flesh from it: shew now thy selfe to be a Christian in following Christ and his advice.Iohn 5. 39. 
                     Search the Scriptures in them you thinke you haue eternall life: if thou deniest not all the world, and thine owne selfe to follow Christ,
                     Luke 14.26. thou art none of his. If thou art therefore the servant of God, (as his servants) cleaue to his word Psal. 119. 31. choose it as thine inheritance, Psal. 119. 111.
                  Remember for motiues to provoke thee to this duty; 1. The practise of all wise men, who if they may choose their dwelling, will looke first to health, and with it (if it may bee) profit and pleasure. This affords thee all: and hence is it, that never any forsooke it, who were once throughly seated by it. 2. The infinite commodities which wee shall reape from thence, and many inconveniences following upon the rejecting of it before mentioned. And remember how steadie a comfort it will bee to thy soule, as at all times, so especially in the evill day, when thou canst say with that holy Patient,Iob 23.12. 
                     I haue not departed from the commandement of his lips, &amp; haue esteemed the words of his mouth more then my appointed food. And as the Prophet,Ier. 15.15.16. 
                     Remember and visite mee, for thy words were found by mee, and I did eate them, and thy word was to mee the joy and rejoycing of my heart.
                  
               
               
                  
                     Proposition 3.
                  
                     
                        
                        
                           Proposition
                        3. The Prophet affirmes, that an ungodly man is not like a tree fruitfull in her season, and ever flourishing.
                  
                  The words haue beene sufficiently opened before: we must remember, that by fruit here is not onely meant the
increase of grace in this life, but of glory also in the life to come. And indeed even these of grace differ from those of glory rather in measure, then in kind: the first being yet in growth and un

                     ipe, the other perfect and mature: surely the highest pitch of mans happinesse even in glory consists in his perfect conformity to the image of God, by seeing him as he is: some other complements are added, but this is the substance: and this estate of grace is but a conti

                     uall reforming,2 Cor. 3.17. and transforming more and more to this image, by beholding him in that mirrour of his word.
                  
                  So the se
                        •
                     se is; The Prophet affirmes, that the ungodly man never attaines either any true saving grace of Gods sanctifying Spirit in this life, or that perfection of glory in the life to come; but whatsoever hee see
                           •
                        es to haue falls and perishes.
                  
                  The proofe is here sufficiently cleered,
                        Proofe.
                      and may bee further confirmed concerning grace;Psal. 36. 1. &amp; 10. 4. 13. thus in duties to God, they haue no feare of God, but are full of Atheisme, and contempt of God: for righteousnesse see Psal. 10. 7. 8. 9. for glorie see Psal. 9. 17. how farre from flourishing and continuing in it, read Psal. 37. 35. 36.
                  
                     Grounds are here, as before; partly that knowledge which he had gotten in the Sanctuarie, partly loue, desiring to turne men from death and destruction, to life and salvation: the first gaue him power to discerne; the second will to speake this truth.
                  
                     
                     
                        Instruction.
                     1. It is altogether impossible, that ungodly or wicked persons such as follow evill counsels, stand in the way of sinners, sit with scorners, neglect the word and meditation in it, should be 
                        •
                     ruitfull in grace, those saving and sanctifying gifts of Gods Spirit. This truth as it is evidently affirmed by the Prophet, so hath it a cloud of witnesses to ratifie and confirme it:Es

                     Ephe. 2. 1. 
                     then may you also doe good, which are accustomed to evill.

                         2. 14. 
                     They are dead in sinnes, cannot perceiue, cannot repent, cannot beleeue.
                     Rom. 2.5. Therefore the Lord compares them to such grounds,Iohn 12. 39. as either betray, resist, or choake the seed.Luke 8.
                  
                  Reasons further to assure this point, are many and evident. For 1. These graces doe not, n
                        •
                     y cannot spring from nature, but are planted by Gods Spirit, and called his fruits Gal. 5. 22. Now not the Spirit of God, but the Spirit of rebellion worketh in the disobedient, that Prince of the ayre Ephe. 2. 2. And certainely as the sower first with the plough cuts up the weedes by the roote, before he casteth in any good seed into the land; so this great Husband man mortifies in us these earthly members, before he creates the new man: he therefore that continues still in his wickednesse, cannot haue this fruit of the Spirit.
                  
                  Secondly, True saving grace as it is planted, so is it nourished by the word of God; It is a right hearing of the word, and receiving it with obedience, which makes us fruitfull:Rom. 10.17. 
                     Colos. 1. 5. 6. Faith comes by hearing. The word sanctifies, Ioh. 17. 17. and indeed is the very seed of those fruits Luke 8. 11. Now then, as since the curse which the Lord layed on the earth we find by experience, that our grounds without tillage and seed bring forth no other fruit but weedes, and nettles, briars, thornes, and thistles: so even reason will teach us, that since the curse hath devoured our Fathers, we cannot without this spirituall tillage and seed of Gods word be fruitfull in this harvest: for God hath appointed seed for every fruit, and although he can, yet will not worke without it, where he giues it: now we know that wicked persons haue no loue to this truth, hate it, reject it, and will not yeelde their strength unto it.
                  Thirdly, The heart of a wicked man so farre forth as it is wicked, is incapeable of these fruits of holin
                        •
                     sse; for
whereas all these graces consist in subjection and conformitie to the law of God, our flesh cannot bee subject to this Law, Rom. 8.7. It is with our barren nature as with some hungry soiles, they must be mended, nay new moulded before they can be fruitfull; that salt of the Sanctuarie must be cast into us, (as into the waters of Iericho) before we can be healed. Looke as that water received into the suspected wife, if shee were defiled, entered into her bowels and rotted her, if innocent, hurt her not, but made her fruitfull. Numb. 5. 27. 28. so this water which we drinke in the house of God, when wee receiue it into a polluted soule, workes to our destruction: but when we (cleered by our high Priest and by him justified) receiue it with a pure affection, it fills us with the blessed fruit of all holinesse.
                  Fourthly, Wheresoever is this spirituall life of holines it washes and clenses, it will not suffer any sinfull wickednesse to dwell peaceably in the heart, much lesse beare rule or haue dominion there.Gal 5.17. 
                     The Spirit lusteth against the flesh. The strong man is cast out by the stronger,
                     Luke 11. 22. 
                     and his goods spoiled. They therefore who liue in rebellion, under the dominion of sinne, where wickednesse keepes quiet possession (as it is in all ungodly persons) cannot possibly haue any fruit of the Spirit. For as where health and life by receit of some good Physicke begin to grow more strong, there nature wrastling with the disease workes to cast out the sicke humour; so when the death and resurrection of Christ are effectually ministred unto us, this life of God being planted in us, struggles against this death of sinne, and will not cease till it haue expelled this hellish infection.
                  Lastly, wickednesse is that qualitie which is altogether contrary and irreconcileably adverse to these fruits of the Spirit, and therefore wheresoever predominant, keepeth out and driues away that by which it selfe is 
                        •
                     tterly destroyed. Now in every wicked man sinne hath the upper hand, whence they haue their denomination;
the kingdome of God cannot bee setled in the heart so long as sinne and Satan haue the scepter. But, as when Ierobam had usurped the Kingdome over the t
                        •
                     n Tribes, he would not suffer the sonnes of David, or any of their favourers to stay in his jurisdiction, and was jealous of every occasion which might giue them any hope or advantage to returne to the Scepter, and for this cause cast out the Levites and worship of God, least the people by such meanes might haue beene drawne from his obedience: so where wickedn
                        •
                     sse hath dominion it keeps out the Kingdome of Christ, resists the word of the Kingdome, and is jealous of every occasion which might bring in the government and dominion of the Lord Iesus.
                  
                  
                      2. It is altogether impossible, that wicked persons, such as despise God in his word, and embrace the wayes and counsels of the ungodly, should enter into the glory of God. This the King of glory often avo

Looke as in God is unspeakable mercy and grace, which hath opened a way by faith and repentance to this his kingdome through Iesus Christ, so likewise is in him a most pure nature, infinitely averse, nay adverse to all sinfull uncleannesse, a righteousnesse which cannot justifie the wicked, and revenging justice persec

                           ting the disobedient sinner, and eternally punishing unrepentant wickednesse. Thus hee makes himselfe knowne to us Exod. 34.6.7. Nahum. 1.3.2 Thes. 1.7. 8. 9.
                        Secondly; The wicked follow such guides, and goe on in such wayes as are altogether opposite to this kingdome
of God: they follow the world, the flesh, and the Devill, carnall, worldly, and devillish men in the wayes of rebellion, which lead to destruction: thus they are here, and every where described, and when they are called to the narrow gate, and the old and good way, they desperately refuse to walke in it.Pro. 1. 31. Now every one shall eate the fruit of his owne wayes. see Rom. 3. 16.Pro 5. 22. 
                           His owne iniquitie shall take the wicked, and he shall be holden in the cords of his owne sinne.
                        
                        3. The glory of Gods kingdome, which wee shall enjoy with him consists principally of righteousnesse, holinesse, and joy of the holy Ghost Rom. 14. 17. And these in their perfection make up the especiall part of our blessed estate. But these are infinitely and unreconcileably contrary to wickednesse, and cannot possibly stand together.
                        Fourthly, Whosoever enters into the Kingdome of God must passe through Christ, who is the doore, and the way: neither is it possible to come to salvation by any other name, or meanes. But the wicked haue nothing in Christ, no part or portion; he prayes nor for the world, but for the faithfull,Iohn 17.9.17 22.24. 
                           that they may bee where hee is, and the glory which God hath given him, hee giveth them: nay they haue no faith, by which onely they are entred into Christ, seing faith purifieth the heart.
                        Lastly, Holinesse is necessarily required to that glorious vision of God, whereby consists our perfect happines not onely as a condition, but as that nature which enableth us to see him. The superiour and transcendent nature cannot bee perceived by the inferiour; a beast may see the shape, but not the reasonable nature of a man, whereby hee farre surmounteth such creatures: a bodily eye neither doth nor can perceiue spirituall substances, not so much as the soule which dwels with it, and in it, and by which it seeth whatsoever it seeth. Now holinesse is that nature of God in man 2 Pet. 1.4. which giues him power to behold God in his divine nature: and it is confessed that wicked persons are altogether void
of holinesse,Heb. 12. 14. and that without holinesse no man shall see God.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                      3. Learne here not onely that wicked persons abiding in the visible Church, and making an hypocriticall profession, shall by some notable fall discover themselues, and be uncased that all the world may know what they are, but the cause also, why thus they fall off and goe away; they are not planted by the rivers, those running and living waters which continue with them:Ier

                      yea to this end, that those whom God approues might bee knowne,1 Cor. 11. 19. and others also might be layd open: certaine it is that no hypocrite doth constantly delight in the whol word, or meditate in it, nor intirely giue up himselfe to it. For either because it is new and fresh, they rejoyce in it for a season: Mat. 13, 20. 21. Iohn 3. 35. or because their hearts are parched and tormented with the t
                        •
                     rrours of the Law, they will then desire this water of life (as when men are in a fit of an Ague) but after the fit is off, nothing regard it. Thus was it with Pharaoh, so with Zedikiah Ier. 37. 17. And that little which they receiue of it, they doe not receiue with sincere affection as the word of God, but keepe themselues free from it, where they list, yeelding some obedience in some particulars, nay indeed not at all obeying, but rather following some naturall inclinations of restraint put into them by God. Thus doe we see some of them at this day plainely uncasing themselues, and
professing Christ liue like beasts. Others when they haue for some sinister ends (as Demas) followed the truth for a time, fall cleane off revolting either to Antichrist, or to the world in covetousnesse and notable profanenes. But many as the Iewes in Iohn Baptist, can for a time rejoyce in the Minister and the word, while they are fresh; or as Herod, till they come crosse of them; but being not planted by the rivers of water, (onely for some respects using a while, but not constantly conversing with the Gospell) in a short space they wither and fall from their profession.

                     1. Here first may those wilfully and even desperately blind persons be censured, who being sunke in a deepe securitie against the light of Gods word, and their owne reason, will perswade themselues and presume, that although they grow old in their wickednesse, and liue in open, grosse, &amp; filthy sins, yet haue they faith as good as the best, as true a loue to God as any of them all, a strong hope of their salvation; they haue as much feare of God and more then these sermon-men, &amp;c. Now as a man, who being to travaile by night in a dangerous way, where on the right and left hand are many steepe rockes, and fearefull downefalls, should yet refuse a skilfull guide with a lanterne or torch; and further because he would not see his danger, would shut his eyes and winke, were but a foole, worthy to bee begged, and no better then a mad man; and though hee should boast much of his skill and knowledge in the passage, that he could blinde-fold, and in the darke goe as safely, and come as secur

                     ly to the end of the way, as he that journyed at mid-day with open eyes, this bragging would make him but more ridiculous in the eye of any reasonable man: such are these. God hath given them the lanterne of his word, and direction of his most wise Spirit to guide them, the way is darke, if they stray but a little on the right or left hand, they are dashed in peeces against the stumbling stone, and
fall into perdition: but they refuse the word, hearken not to their owne reason, but following their sense, like bruit beasts, wilfully proceed till they fall headlong into everlasting destruction both of body and soule: would they take the word along with them, they would soone perceiue their wilfull errour: That would tell them; Faith purifieth the heart.
                     Acts 15 9.

They make no doubt at all of obteining the kingdome of God: There is no question, they thinke, and say, of all this; well: what is the ground of this so strong confidence? Certainly it is a Castle in the ayre, without any foundation; but onely a presumptuous conceit of an idle braine: Had the Spirit planted in them this perswasion, the flesh would lay batterie to it, and labour to weaken it, objecting an hundred feares, and shaking it with wavering: nay the Spirit also would make this advantage of the enemie, to use more diligence to make their calling and election sure,
                     2 Pet. 1.8.9. 10. by fortifying that which is weake, and adding grace unto grace.Luke 11. 21. But this is the device and worke of Satan, that strong man, who having possession keepes all in his peace. The Devill having got them in this his cradle of presumptuous securitie, rockes them in sleepe of sinne by this pleasing dreame: and were their eyes never so little open, that one sparke of spirituall light might enter, they could not but see how they are besotted: For aske them; Is not eternall life the gift of God? They cannot deny it. And on whom doth hee bestow it, but on his faithfull servants? And how doe wee serue him,Luke 2. 74.75 but in holinesse and righteousnesse? Doe you thus serue him? Is swearing, profaning the Lords day by doing our owne will, neglecting, nay despising the word, Sacraments, prayer publike and private, are these any parts of holinesse? Is lying, railing, cursing, spightfull dealing, stealing, &amp;c. any part of righteousnesse? Doe you not liue in these or some of these sinnes? doe you keepe your mouth as with a bridle? feare an oath? detest a slander as well as a slanderer? Doe you tremble and rejoyce in the word? do you cōtinue in prayer? &amp;c. Here they haue no other refuge, but
those miserable fig-leanes, which cannot hide their nakednesse. Are you (say they) without your faults? wee cannot be Saints on earth, &amp;c.

Vnderstand then thou vaine man, that the God of glory openeth his kingdome to those,Rom 27.8. that seeke glory by continuance in well-doing, howsoever they are weake and imperfect: but to those that disobey the truth, and obey unrighteousnesse, shall be indignation and wrath.

                        The Psalmist affirmes, that the wicked shall not prosper in their actions.
                  
                  The words haue before beene sufficiently unfolded. The proofe is also plaine, and very often repeated.
                        Proofe.
                      Obserue but that one Psal. 37. and especially in it the 9. 10. 14. 15. 17. 20. 35. 36. 38. verses.
                  The grounds likewise haue before beene delivered;
                        Grounds.
                      Read the 73. Psalme, wherein the Prophet layes downe the meanes whereby hee came to know the miserie of wicked men, whose estate before hee had so much admired.
                  
                     
                     
                        Instruction.
                     1. Howsoever to a carnall eye and sense, the estate of some wicked men seemes glorious, yet as well reason, as much more the word of God, will openly discover their miserie and woefull condition. Thus the Wise-man speaking by a farre greater (even the infinite) wisedome of God testifies.Eccles. 8.12. 13. 
                     Though God prolongs a sinners dayes, yet it shall not be well with the wicked, he shall be like a shadow because he feareth not before God.
                     See Esay 65. 20. The whole chapter almost of Levit. 26. from the 14. to the 40. verse, and Deut. 28. from the 16. to the end, stand up as witnesses at large to this truth. Compare with those threatnings the issue following: Lay downe that commination first, which wee find pronounced against this people when they had asked a King 1 Sam. 12. 25. Read the story of Gods people and obserue their prosperitie, when enjoying religious Princ
                        •
                     s they kept the Ordinances of God, and squared their practice to his lawes: and the great calamities which fell upon them, when they by the mis-leading of wicked Kings, fell off from the worship commanded by God, to follow their owne devises. What infinite mischiefes and vexations oppressed them in the times of Rehoboam, Iehoram, Ahaz, Manasseh, and such other?
When the tenne Tribes fell away from the true worship of God, and polluted themselues with the Idols of Ieroboam; marke how the Lord followed them with continuall scourges, grievous troubles and afflictions, untill they were utterly consumed. Doe but compare 1 Chron. 21.5. with 1 King. 20. 15. And how easily shall wee there see, how the body of this people strucken by God with an hectike fever, or consumption, languished and decreased, and at length became a very small and poore people. And no marvaile if they soone decayed, for in one battell against Iudah they lost fiue hundred thousand chosen men.
                     2 Chron. 13. 17. Compare with this, that spoken in particular of a wicked King, Ier. 22. 30. and 2 Chron. 24. 20. Reason also will evidently confirme this truth.
                  For 1. Prosperitie consisteth not (as wee haue seene) in any particular successe of some one, or m
                        •
                     re ends; but of that generall end of all our particular actions: and maine scope of all our endeavours: which if it bee frustrate, makes us the more unhappy. For the more wee haue prospered in some intentions, and so now accounted our selues certaine, and almost in possession of our wishes, the more griefe will ensue, when wee see our selues (contrary to our hopes and expectation) carried backe againe, and now farther off then at first. Now we know that blessednesse is the supreame end of all our labours; wch no wicked man can possibly obtain, as being neither to be obtained in this life, where the best estate of man is full of vanitie (Psal. 39. 5.) and much vexation: and lesse in the other life, where they haue no hope.
                  2. Prosperitie and successe cannot but in reason proceed from one of these originals, either God, Fortune, or our owne wit and counsell: Now for the counsels of men the Lord evidently and frequently witnesseth,Psal. 9. 15.16. &amp; 7. 14.15. 16. that the foote of wicked Counsellours is taken in their owne net, and are snared in the workes of their owne hands: when they haue conceived mischiefe, and traveld with iniquitie, they
bring forth a lie: for hee thinkes to intrap others, but he falleth into the ditch and pit which himselfe hath made, and his mischiefe returnes upon his owne head. As for that Idol and vaine name of Fortune, reason will hisse it out of the stage of the world, and all action. God then onely giues successe and prosperitie, who hating the wicked, will not, nor indeed can suffer them to prosper; howsoever he may in his infinite wisedome giue them leaue to enjoy some successe in their affaires, to their destruction and his glorie.
                  3. Lastly, reason can see the unhappinesse of those, who having restlesse designes and projects all their day

                  It will not bee unfit to insert here that discourse of Cineas an heathen Oratour. For when Pyrrhus King of Epirus was sollicited by some people of Italie, to bee the head of their league against the Romanes, while hee sate musing on these affaires, Cineas his gr

The Oratour demaunds if he should haue the better, what would hee doe then; He answered, that then Sicilie, and Sardinia would bee soone at his commaund. The other consented, but still ask
                        •

                     n Africke could not hold out, but might easily be conquered. But Cineas still pursues him with the old question, what he would doe then; He againe answered, that when all these Countries were subdued, Graecia would soone bee brought under his yoke. But being againe demaunded what he purposed to doe then, he apprehending the Oratours intention and smiling replied; Then Cineas, we will rest and be merrie. The Oratour wisely answered,
that may you do now, without all this danger, &amp; trouble to your selfe and others.

                     and he returneth to his earth, (if not before) all his thoughts perish.
                  
                  
                      2. All the policies, wisest counsels, and subtill devises of men, if they are not squared out according to the rule of Gods wisedome in the word, are very foolishnes, and nothing else but idle dreames of a sottish braine;Esay 29. 16. 
                     your turning of devises shall it not bee esteemed as the potters clay.
                     1 Cor. 3.19.

                     1 King. 11.38. 1 King. 12. 26. 27.28. That devise of Ieroboam, refusing the advise of God by Abyah, not suffering the people to carry their sacrifices to Ierusalem, &amp; there to worship,2 Chron. 11. 14. 15. thrusting the Priests and Levites out of their possession, as favourers of the kingdom of David, &amp; with them Gods worship; was in the sight of man sound policie, but being opposite to the word, was, and so proved the notablest folly in the world, &amp; wrought the contrary end, not the establishing his house and kingdome as he intended, but the utter subversion of it.1 King. 21. The subtile plot of Iezabel for compassing Naboths vineyard (who by painting her face, had learned to colour her foul murther with shewes of pietie) cloaking perjurie and bloud under the vaile of religion, fasting, and Gods honour, carried a good shew in the eye of man, and prospered in the immediate end, but not in that which she pu

                     posed: ir was the ruine of herselfe and the whole familie. Achitophels counsell was very craftie, but it snared his owne necke in an halter. Nay even some of Gods children when they haue forgot
themselues, and leaving this rule of pietie, searched out wicked policies, haue beene brought to much trouble by it; as Abraham endangered his wiues chastitie by his equivocation. David heaped up many mischiefs on himselfe and his familie by covering his adulterie with murther; and Iehosaphats politicke marriage for combining those two sister Kingdomes, proved the greatest affliction that ever that Kingdome tasted. Neither is it possible it should be otherwise: for

                        First, in all motions the third followes the second, and the second the first: And in the heavenly revolutions, though the sphears of the starres in their proper motion bend from west to east, yet because the first mover is swiftly carried from east to west, these also being drawn along by it in their daily motion, proceed from east to west, though in their yeerely motion they are moved contrary: so howsoever the hearts of men, being prone to all wickednesse, in their own intentions are inclinable to all mischiefe, yet because the most just God sits at the sterne, and directs all the enterprises of all creatures, and carries all their actions to his owne ends, hence is it, that they cannot accomplish their owne purposes, nor bring their devises to effect.
                        Secondly; Certaine is it that the Iudge of all the world cannot doe any thing unjustly, nor suffer evill;Pro. 21.39. Now there is no understanding or counsell against the Lord, therfore though many devises are in the heart of man,

They that sow the wind, shall reape the whirl wind: so that even the experience of all men hath brought it to a proverbe, Evill counsell heapes most evill on the Counsellour. Witnesse that infamous conspiracie of Papists, the most bloody, craftie, malicious, and every way devillish counsell that ever the world heard, which though so long carried with admirable secresie amongst so many, yet was the ruine of the Complotters, and the everlasting shame of that Satanicall Synagogue: who haue in an high measure justified it, in canonizing an hand so died in bloud, and so deepe in this savage enterprise, and haue fitted a strawie Saint to a religion of stubble; yet thus farre may hee well bee called a Martyr, that he is, and ever shall bee a witnesse to this truth, namely, that the whore of Rome is bloodie, impudent, and ashamed of nothing; and how well Antichrist agrees with Satan, who was a murtherer from the beginning.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                      3. Learn here what is prosperitie which men so eagerly pursue and hunt after: 1. Therefore it doth not consist in temporal things; were all the blessings of this life heaped upon one person, &amp; grace denied him, though he shall go on in this estate till hee went out into another world, hee cannot be truely accounted a prosperous man;Iob 21. 7. 8. &amp;c. for wicked men prosper in these things,Psal. 73 12. yet no wicked man hath here prosperitie,Ier. 5. 28. as here is affirmed, and hath beene many wayes proved. For as man consisteth as well of soule as body, so his prosperitie is as well of the soule, as body. 3. Iob. 2. Nay because the soule is the most principall part; hence prosperitie of body, without that of the
soule cannot make a man prosperous. A man of excellent stature, proportion, and beautie, but a foole is no excellent man. And as in the body if some limbes are well formed, others deformed, he is not said to bee of a comely body; so this lesser prosperitie without the other is nothing. Prosp

                     1. Here is rebuked that folly of men, who desiring to prosper, yet wilfully take the way which leads to destruction, and turne out of that path, in which God hath promised to giue them what they seeke: see Esay 30.15.16. The in

This is with them the onely blessednesse, that they may doe and haue what they list, this the onely miserie, that they want their will, and cannot haue to satisfie their lusts. Thus they doe not onely condemne the generation of the just, and the children of God, but the onely begotten sonne as miserable, and

                      hand of the world, to which

Certainely this is the disposition of carnall men, falsely called Christians, that never thinking of the providence of God, supplying every creature, they are carried downe in the violent streame of worldly lusts, and plunging their soules in the cares of it, make it all their study, spend all their time, and consume their life to provide and lay up for themselues and others that belong unto them. As for the other life, they dream it comes of it selfe without seeking, and that it will meete or overtake them at the end; And building upon an imagina

                      2. That pride of men preferring their owne wits before Gods wisedome must be reproved; Looke to all kinds of people, wee shall soone perceiue this Atheisme in contempt of Gods counsell and wis

                     ny that helpes of the tongues, art, and such studies may be, and are in their measure very profitable and needfull; yet that these should take up not onely the greatest time in the studie,
but all the pulpit, is so absurd in reason, but especially such a paradoxe in divinitie; and aboue all, such a dishonour to the Spirit, that certainely it discovers much Atheisme, and contempt of Gods wisedome.
                  For even among us (to reserue their place for the Papists) the infinite and ambitious allegations of Fathers, Schoole-men, Rabbies, Poets, and all manner of humane testimonies, and especially with all this, the rare and thinne citation of the word, shewes at the best much foolish ostentation, and little desire of setting up the crosse of Christ in the hearts of the hearers: certainely hee is blind and hath little experience, who hath not observed that studies of Divines entred upon Schoole-men especially, and other humane (though Ecclesiasticall) Authors, but without any constant meditation in the word, and a ground taken from thence, hath beene the Mother and Nurse of so much errour, Poperie, Arminianisme, and such sects. Thus is it with the meaner sciences. Every Tradesman hath his mysteries, so contrary to the mysterie of godlinesse, that every one may see there is a generall departure from God and his wisedome; and everie idle braine preferres his owne wit as a better helpe to prosper, then the rule of God. This folly is the more sottish, because none of them dare deny, but that God is more wise then man, that his providence is over all to reward every man according to his workes.

Oh! that men would therefore be perswaded to decline those by-paths, in which seeking prosperitie, they are sure to misse it, and indeed so seeking, eschew and flie that which they seeke; and to search for it in those wayes where it will infallibly meete them.

                     Proposition 5.
                  In the second part of this verse, the Prophet sets downe the cursed estate of the wicked, by a plaine but excellent comparison of chaffe, driven with the winde, where the proposition is evident, namely;
                  
                     
                        
                        
                           
                              
                                 •
                              roposition
                        The Spirit, and the Prophet by the Spirit affirmeth the wicked to bee as chaffe driven with the winde.
                  
                  For opening the words, consider what is this chaffe, and what is the resemblance betweene the chaffe and the wicked, and also what answers in this comparison to the winde.
                  
                  
                     1. This word chaffe doth not signifie the huske covering the graine, of which though there is not much, yet is some use; but that dust, which by beating of the corne rises from the chaffe, those a
                           •
                        omes (as we may call them) or motes of the chaffe, which are altogether unprofitable, and which we fan out and cast away.
                  2. But what is the resemblance betweene them?
                  Not to be curious. 1. The chaffe groweth up in the same field, and is brought home into the same barne with the wheat: so wicked hypocrites are in the same visible Church, and are mingled in the Congregation of the Saints.
                  
                  2. The chaffe and wheat are both beaten with the same flaile, and the wheat purged by it, but the chaffe turned into dust and filth: so the wicked and saithfull are partakers of the same gracious word, and rods; and the Saints are indeed refined, and clensed by it, the wicked grow worse and worse.
                  3. This chaffe-dust is profitable no way, noysome many wayes; it hurts our eyes, spreads our garments with filth: thus there is no good to be reaped from wicked persons, but much hurt: they will hinder us in our light, they will draw us to defile our garments.
                  4. Every Husbandman will separate in his time the chaffe from the wheat: so will Christ make a separation betweene the Goats and the sheepe.
                  5. Lastly, in that separation the chaffe is destroyed and consumed; so in that day of the Lord the wicked shall bee burned with unquenchable fire.
                  
                  3. The winde in this similitude is compared to the judgements of God, either in this, or in the other life: in this, afflictions and troubles without and within; in the other, their finall condemnation.
                  So that the sense is; Howsoever wicked men are in the Church, partakers of the same ordinances of God, yet receiue they no profit by them, but become altogether unprofitable &amp; noysome, therefore God will in his time separate them, &amp; cast
them into utter perdition of body and soule.

                      1. Heere wee learne that a wicked man, or woman is profitable for nothing, but many wayes noysome to all, and in all respects. To that end here compared by the Spirit to chaffe, or dust of chaffe, so in that whole chapter Ezekiel resembled to the wood of an unfruitfull vine, which cannot so much as make a pin to hang up any vessel: and by our Saviour to a tree that bringing no fruit, cumbers the ground.Luke 13.7.

                      Sin and wickednesse is that which most aviles, and debases a man in the eye of God: neither indeed is there any thing, which iustly breedes, and bringes contempt upon a man but sin, neither any man, or creature so base, and contemptible as a sinfull, and wicked creature. Looke as brasse, or copper mingled with gold, tinne, or leade with silver makes it base, so that it is reiected, and will not goe currant: so doth the wickednesse of a man, or nation: see. Ier. 6.28. 29. 30. Ezek. 22. 18. Psal. 119. 119. They are reprobate silver, brasse, tinne drosse. Nay even holy men (how much more the most holy God) can account wicked men vile, and despise them in that respect. Psal. 15.4. Hence are they called Bastards. Heb. 12. 8. and continually compared to the most abject, and loathsome creatures. To dogs, and swine 2. Pet. 2.22. to Serpents Psal. 58.4. their heart to a raging sea, foaming out mire. Esa. 57. 20 their throat is an open sepulchre belching out stinke, and rottennesse: Psal. 5. 9. Nay indeede to very dung. Mal. 2. 3. and meere corruption Psal. 5. 9. Evident reason will further cōfesse, and confirme this truth For basenesse is nothing else but a degeneration, or fall from that excellencie, which is natiue to any creature. Thus coynes are said to be embased: or men when they are cast downe from any dignitie, or honour, which formerly they enioyed. Now wicked men are wholy degenerate from that exellencie of their creation, being borne Sonnes of God, and deiected themselves under not onely other creatures, but the basest of creatures, Satan, and worse then any creature, Sinne it selfe: being once the rulers over all the creatures, and now become vassals to their owne filthy, and noysome lusts. In which regarde it is manifest, that every creature (the wicked Spirits onely excepted) is far more noble then a
wicked man. Certainely in the 
                        •
                     oad, and Serpent, there remaines yet that sense and life in which they were created: But man is altogether dead and rotten, in respect of that life of grace, in which he was made, having lost not onely the noble sense of spirituall seeing, but that necessary sense also of feeling: altogether senselesse in that life of holinesse, in which he was formed at first, and conformed to God. 2. No circumstantiall accident, or qualitie, but such as are inherent can debase, or vilifie any substance. Gold were it covered all over with durt, not the lesse precious: but any mixture of baser mettall makes it of lesse worth. Thus neither povertie, contempt of men, weaknes of body, are any iust causes of despising, in all which estates we reade of heathens honourable in the eyes of their coaevals, and many Christians glorious in the eyes of God, and men: But sinne being once rooted in man, is such an inherent qualitie, as eats out of him whatsoever is perfectly good, as holines: perverting the best natures to most evill; It strips the body of that glory, and maiesticall beautie in which it was framed, and covers it with shamfull nakednes. It robs the soule of all those glorious endowments, with which it was gorgeously apparelled by the Creatour, and brings upon it a most miserable povertie, and loathsome deformitie. Certainely as wilfull rebellion against an earthly Prince, taints the blood, and abases the whole stocke, making them of noble vile, of rich poore, so that they instantly lose all civill priviledge, and preferment, so the treason, and rebellion against the King of heaven by sinne, casteth man downe from that height of dignitie, which he enioyed in his service, and onely by his favour, to the lowest, and basest degree of all the creatures.
                  
                      Howsoever wicked men may flourish in the eyes of carnall persons, and even reigne upon

                     arth in an outward false prosperitie: howsoever they are so mingled in the church, that they cannot (many times) be discerned
by man; yet the judgments of God will surely finde, and single them out, and bring them in due time to utter confusion. This is here somewhat darkly in a comparison, but very strongly confirmed, when they are resmbled to chaffe before the wind: for as the dust of chaff

                        •
                     6.7. and 140. 11. Looke as dogges pursuing an Hare, or Deere, follow incessantly, and though they flie from one starting hole to another, yet never giue over till they take and destroy them: so shall the judgements of God pursue the wicked, &amp; though they seeme to escape some evils, yet shall they certainely bee followed till they are utterly consumed.
                  Thus when Ahab had sold himself
                        •
                      to doe wickedly; first a long drouth and famine findes him out, starts, and pursues him: when he had escaped that, the sword followes him: when there through the mercie and long suffering of God calling to repentance, hee had gotten the better, and now by wicked policie had setled his kingdome, and made way to his tyrannie in the bloud of Naboth, the fearefull threatnings of God overtake him, and fill his soule with fright and horrour: when hee now through a fained repentance had winded out of that miserie, yet the vengeance of God so closely hunted him, that in spight of all warnings, he falls by the sword of the Syrians, the dogges licke up his bloud, and eate up all his familie. Thus Iehoram sonne of Iehosaphat (2 Chron. 21.) being a wicked King, is first put up by the Edomites, then hunted by the Arabians, lost his goods, his sonnes, his wiues: lastly a sore and tedious disease overtakes him,
and at length pulls out his very guts with grievous torments: and the reason (a most necessary and infallible cause of this effect) is that justice and office of God, being Iudge of all the world.
                  
                     
                     
                        Examinatiō.
                     2. Take hence a sure tryall of thy estate. Thou art borne under the Covenant, and in the Church; but know the chaffe springs and ripens with the graine: thou art a member of the visible Church, the chaffe is brought in with the corne: thou enjoyest the meanes of eternall life, the word, Sacraments, rods in afflictions; but the chaffe and wheat are beaten and sifted together. But therefore passing by such common workes, which agree as well to the reprobate as to the godly, examine and try how these ordinary meanes worke upon thee, and what effect thou seest proceed from them. The flaile beats out the corne, and the fanne purifies it: if then thou art one of those, whom that great Husband-man will gather into his Granaries, the word of God shall separate thee from the heap of worldly men; and it, together with the fatherly chastisements of God, shall continually purge and clense thy heart from the sinfull drosse which is in it. If then thou findest the word, and these rods thus to worke on thee, thou art safe: Dost thou then every day see more cause of dislike in thy selfe, in thy wayes? learnest to abhorre thy selfe, denie thy self, judge thy selfe? Do those chastisements of God weane thy heart from the vanities of this life, and the flatteries of this world? so that thou accountest all things dung in comparison of the knowledge of Christ, his death and resurrection working in thee the death of sinne, and life of grace. These are good signes of life and health: when the wind blowes, dost thou not fli
                        •

                     ured, that choose rather to bee
the dust of chaffe, then the corne: and will not bee perswaded to come out of that cursed condition. How many are there who flatter themselues in their wayes, untill their abominable wickednesse be found out by the judgements of God? They giue up their hearts to the world, follow the sinfull profits and pleasures of it, and will not be perswaded to delight in the word of God, or the good way pointed out by that word; as long as they feele not the curse, (and alas how should they feele, being past all feeling?) they despise the threatnings of God, and lie downe in their mire, which not onely fills them with filth, and prepares them to endlesse miserie, but defiles the land, and brings a curse upon all that are neere them.
                  
                      2. Those that cannot bee intreated to separate themselues from such companie, wher not only it is impossible to receiue any profit or good, but where they shall surely smart with them. When they heare the warning of Gods Spirit,Pro. 14. 7. 
                     Depart from the foolish man, when thou perceivest not in him the lippes of knowledge, they are deafe and stop their eares. Thus wee see many ignorant soules continue in Babylon, till they partake of her plagues, and bring an old house (as we say, and they felt) upon their heads. And many simple people frequent idolatrous houses, of Papists, till at length by Gods just judgement they are snared. Will men yeeld to the voice of God,
                     Pro, 23.20. and 4.14.15. 
                     Keepe not companie with drunkards? Doe they presently obey the heavenly warning? doe they not despise these admonitions not of man but of God; aske them, what profit haue you by such companie? what credit? doe you not sometimes fall into many inconveniences temporall and spirituall by this societie? Can you bee in the fellowship of the Saints, and of God through Christ, when thus your heart cleaveth to wicked sinfull persons? Haue you any right to that holy Hill, when you make much of a man vile, unprofitable, and noysome, and the righteous is contemned in thine eyes? Psal. 15. 4. nothing awakes them.
                  3. That stiffe unbeliefe of heart resisting this evident

                      truth, and resolving to giue no credit to it: when wee heare the Wisedome of God witnesse to us,Pro. 12. 26. 
                     the righteous man is more excellent then his neighbour: doe we seale to this testimonie, that it is true? when we heare the Lord speake so contemptuously of wicked persons, that they are dogges, swine, drosse, filth, corruption; doe our hearts answer, truth Lord, and humbling our soules with that Cananite, confesse our selues no better in nature, so abhorre our owne filthinesse, and uncessantly blesse that glorious Saviour, who hath washed, clensed, and changed us to his glorious image? Oh! how few stand thus affected? witnesse our common behaviour: for are we downe the winde, streightned in a low, base, and despicable condition, and are there any meanes offered to rise, and prefer ourselues? who doth not instantly apprehend and pursue them, be they difficult, be they dangerous, be they almost desperate, venturing our liues by sea, by land to attain to a better estate, though in hope onely? wee will often put our liues in venture, when our hopes are but in peradventure. Are we now got up unto some comfortable or honourable place? doe we know that by want of such or such observances we shall quickly fall againe; but stand and increase by performance of some no hard service: who neglects it? What Farmer obserues not a good Land-lord? what Courtier doubles not his diligence to a bountifull Prince; that he may still enjoy his favour? But now turne your eie upon the behaviour of Christians; the Lord tells us, thou art as base in thy nature as the earth thou treadest on, as the dung thou scornest to tread on: it is sinne makes thee thus base and abject. Desirest thou the true honour and dignitie of my kingdome? know they certainely attaine, that constantly seeke it:Rom. 2. 7. 10. 
                     If by continuance in well-doing thou seekest glory, honour, and immortalitie, thou shalt reape eternall life. To every one that doth good, shall bee honour and glory: but to the contentious, and disobedient to the truth, Rom. 2. 8.9.and obeying unrighteousnesse, shall bee indignation and wrath: Tribulation and anguish
upon every soule that doth evill. Now when so gracious meanes are offered, who takes hold of them? who giues up his soule to obedience of this truth? who withdrawes his heart from the subjection of sinne? by this wee manifest our grosse unbeliefe and contempt of God, and his word.
                  
                      4. The cursed securitie of our sluggish nature never trembling at the judgements of God denounced in his word, till they over-take and attach vs. Is God gracious?Iude 4. wee abuse his grace to wantones. Is he patient?Eccles. 8. 11. wee abuse his patience to hardnesse, and encouragement to sinne. Is he silent expecting our returne?Psal. 50.21. wee abuse his silence to blasphemie, and thinke him like our selues: nothing moues us till we are arrested by the judgements of God. Oh how farre are we from that melting heart of good Iosiah? we can heare thunders of the law with lesse feare then boyes their owne squibs and crackers; we can see the roddes of God on every hand of us, and 
                        ••

                        Exhortation
                     Oh then let us be stirred up to abhorre this sinfull vanitie, which turnes us into chaffe, and exposes us to certaine perdition. Say, oh say to thy soule: Dost thou carefully provide against disgrace and contempt of this world, dost thou cast about and find out an hundred devises to under-prop my credit and dignitie on earth? and what? wilt thou suffer me to fall into eternall shame, and confusion? It is sinne, it is onely sinne which can debase mee; povertie, reproaches, despising of men cannot vilifie me, but in the sight of fooles; but rather enobles me in the sight of God, Angels, good (nay even heathen) men. Bend then all thy forces against sinne, and never let that finde any grace or favour in thine eyes, which heapes upon thee all disgrace and scorne in the eyes of God. Destroy it which else certainely will bring thee to
destruction. Vse therefore carefully the meanes; Let that sword of the Spirit bee ever drawne in thy hand to cut off this corruption, which else will certainely cut thee off from GOD himselfe, and all his blessings for evermore.
               
            
            
               
               Psalme I. Verse V. Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgement, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
               
                  HEEre the Prophet further aggravates the cursed estate of wicked persons, by a double consequent certainely attending them. 1. They shall not stand in the judgement. 2. They shall not stand in the congregation of the righteous. Whence arises this conclusion.
               
                  
                  
                     Proposition
                  
                  The ungodly shall not stand in the judgement.
               
               Little explication shall need: who were the ungodly was before opened: The word strictly taken is confined to the breach of the first table; and in this place, though I would not absolutely restraine it to that sense, yet it is very probable, that it doth here especially point out such as neglect God in his worship,1 Tim. 1
                        •
                      9. and the word sinners, the unrighteous;1 Pet 4.18. they are joyned often: certaine is it, where ungodlinesse is rooted, there unrighteousnes flourisheth, and where unrighteousnesse is fruitfull, ungodlinesse is there deepely grounded.
               
                  2. Iudgement is double, either in this life or the other: the temporall judgements see described, 1 Pet. 4. 17. Psal. 82. 8. and 96. 13. For hee commeth, for hee commeth to judge the earth: and is either exercised in the inward court of the conscience, or in the outward by afflictions. Secondly, the judgement of that other life, is called the generall judgement, and the judgement of the great day, (Iude 6.) the judgement after death, Heb. 9.27.
               3. To stand in judgement, is a phrase of speech signifying to overcome, or to bee cleere when wee are judged: compare Rom. 3. 4. with Psal. 5. 5. So the Latines say, that a man falls in judgement, when he looseth the day. So then they shall not stand in judgement, is all one as if it were said, they shall be cast in judgement, yea cast downe for ever and shall rise no more.
               The sense then is: Such as are without the feare of God, and care to please him, as Atheists, hypocrites, both when God rises here to judgement, either sitting in their conscience, or dealing with them in outward things by sicknesse or the like; and especially when hee calls them to that great and generall Assises, shall utterly fall and bee swallowed up in condemnation, and finally be cut off, and receiue their portion with the Devill and his Angels.
               
               
                  
                     Proofe.
                  
                  Proofe. Psal. 7. 11. 12. to the 17. verse, and 9.16.17. Pro. 19.29. Nothing is more common in the Scripture, then the denunciation and execution of temporall and eternall judgements upon ungodly and wicked persons.
               
                  
                     Grounds.
                  The grounds may bee manifest to children: for this falling in judgement, or condemnation arises necessarily from these two causes; 1. the guilt of the person judged appearing upon sufficient evidence: 2. the uprightnesse of the Iudge pronouncing sentence according to the fact. Now ungodly persons are not onely guiltie, but the evidence palpable; for ungodlinesse, despising God, his word, worship and service, is that rebellion and treason against the King of Kings, compared to witchcraft and
Idolatry: 1 Sam. 15.23. and the evidence undeniable; 1. the conscience accusing,1 Iohn 3.20. 
                  Rom. 2. 15. 16. and with it God the faithfull witnesse, greater then the conscience. 2. The Iudge inflexible to any partialitie. Rom. 3. 5. 6. and 2. 11. Pro. 17. 15.
               
                  
                  
                     Instruction.
                  1. Howsoever flesh and bloud dreame of immunitie, and impunitie, and presumptuously counterfeit a mercy in God swallowing up his justice, yet is it impossible, but that there should be a judgment wherein men should receiue according to their workes.Eccles. 3.17. and 11.9. And as among men there are Sessions and Assises, some dayes more generall for all, some more private and purchased sittings: so shall we finde that God hath sometimes a Iayle-deliverie, when he enters into judgement with some particular Nations, or persons, besides that great and terrible day of the Lord, when all creatures shall be called to reckoning, see Psal. 7. 11. Prov. 11. 21. 31. Ier. 25. 29. 1 Pet. 4. 17. 18. The generall deluge of waters swallowing the old world, and that more particular and fearefull vengeance of fire and brimstone drinking up the fiue Cities, and the private destruction of Ieroboam, Ahab, and their families; and infinite other precedents, are abundant witnesses of this truth.
               But doe we not see wicked rebells often flourish, and liue in wealth and prosperitie, yea die also and are buried peaceably, and pompously?
               Answer: To remoue this stumbling stone; Certainly if the godly be here judged, much more the wicked; and if David and other Saints are corrected, no doubt but the reprobates are here also afflicted: for although their especiall judgement is to come, yet now they goe not free without the whip.Eccles. 9 2. 
                  All things come alike to all; when the righteous bee scarcely saved, where shall the ungodly and sinner appeare?
                  1 Pet. 4.18. which is spoken of temporall judgements, as manifestly appeares by the former verses: see also Pro. 11. 31.
               
                  1. Therefore even those, who most seeme to flourish, haue often some scourge, which wholy distasts all their pleasure, nay many times some little crosse (hardly so to bee called) embitters all their abundance, that they liue in it without ioy, or comfort. Do but remember Ahab so vexe with Naboths deniall, that all his Kingly delights could yeeld him no content. And looke on Haman so troubled with the stiffe knee of Mordecay, that all his preferment, and favour with the King nothing availed him. Ester. 5. 13. wee see not the heart of any of these, nor know where they are pinched: wee perceiue some of them liue in great plentie; But neither life, nor health, nor content consists in abundance: we see some of them laugh,Pro. 14. 13. but euen in laughter the heart is sorrowfull, and the end of that mirth is heavines. Certain is it that the nature of man takes more pride in building, planting, purchasing, then content, or ioy in any of these things, when we inioy them. And I know, that Salomon, when he had tried all earthly things found in them nothing but vainity, and vexation. The certain knowledge of death, and ignorance, what should become of his soule after death, forced the great Emperour to sigh, and lam

Oh thinke how deeply this thought must wound a worldly Christian, who hath so much Christianitie, that he knowes an hell, and so little faith (nay no faith) that he cannot expect heauen? who desiring and enioying his portion in this world, can looke for no other in the world to come, but that of the rich Glutton (Luk. 16. 25.) Thou in thy life time receiuedst pleasure, therefore now art thou tormented? verily were there no other affliction for these men, but this very thought, it were sufficient to distast a whole world of pleasure, and earthly riches, which any man can enioy in this present life, and to make him in his owne feeling most miserable, who
in the eyes of carnall men appeers very happie, and glorious: and as that Philosophical Poet writeth:

Cor. 5, 10. and the Iudge himselfe Math. 25. 31. to the end of that chapter: as verily as Christ is alreadie come in humiliation to bee iudged, so shall he come in glory to iudge: neither will I stand further to proue a thing confessed, and with reason confirmed by the heathens. Onely let us note, that as all things shall be framed to the infinite comfort of the faithfull, so to as much terrour to the ungodly. The Iudge shall bee their Saviour, their witnes the same Iudge, and their owne peaceable conscience: the sentence, Come you blessed: the earth the place of all their sorrow burning, and heaven open to entertaine them into the everlasting habitations

Againe, they haue no right to any good thing, but are as theeues, who while they are in their woods and coverts, frollicke, but when apprehended, they are utterly dejected. For the other the truth is, there is nothing left for comfort, but all without and within are full of infinite horrour.

                  1. How fearefull then is that infidelitie and securitie of men denying this truth, and therefore never preparing for that day? Some are so fast a-sleepe, rocked by the pleasures and delights in the flesh, and so ravished with the dreames of sensualitie, that they neither can, nor desire they could awake: some so plunged in profits, either the swe

                  tnesse of gaine so bewitching, or worldly cares so possessing head and heart, that they haue neither power or leasure to thinke of this, or any thing else belonging to their eternall good. True it is, that especiall warning is given concerning these things, Luke 21. 34. 35. Mark .13. 33. and the mischiefe following fore-told us there by the Iudge, but all the senses are so busied abroad in the world, that there is none at home to answer him. Should any friend thus call to us, nay any man in the way, Take heed to your selues, whatsoever wee were doing, we would looke about us and consider the danger; but, as if our Lords warnings were onely of course, wee take no care of them, or of our selues. How wofull will bee the end of this drowsinesse? how fearefull our awaking? For what will you doe now in the day of your visitation,
and destruction which shall come? To whom will you flie, or where will you leaue your glory? Thou who hast spent all thy time in vanitie, what wilt thou doe in the day of visitation, of thy sicknesse and trouble, when thy pleasures fall like dry leaues in Autumne, and all worldly commodities and comforts stand by mute, and all amort? Then thou wilt cry;Pro. 5.12. 13. 
                  How haue I hated instruction, and mine heart despised correction? and haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught mee, nor inclined mine eares to them that instructed mee? Especially when by some smarting blow the Lord hath slayed off that skinne of thy conscience, so that now with infinite torment thy hellish sinnes like a worm gnaw &amp; eate into thy soule: when thou seest the armies of thy rebellions, more frightfull then so many hellish fiends, mustered up before thine eyes, and all armed with fierie darts kindled by Satan, invading on everie side, and wounding thy naked soule; and worse then all this, the fierie wrath of God, and terrours of the Almightie to fall downe upon thy head. Then, O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver mee from the wrath to come? Then the Minister must bee sent for, then the word read and applied; then oh! that I could heare, oh! that I could beleue, oh! that I could pray: oh for a drop of faith, of repentance, of mercie! But then who can know whether God will hide himselfe, whether the word shall profit, or his eare be stopt to thy petitions? Then shalt thou see in his colours, and heare with unspeakable affrighting, that cursed Satan tell thee out of the booke of truth,Psal. 32. 6. 
                  In the great water flouds, they shall not come neere him. When you stretch out your hands I will hide mine eyes, and though you make many prayers, I will not heare.
                  Esay 1. 15. He will tell thee, remember how long the Lord hath sought thee: sometime hee commaunded in the thundrings of the Law; sometime hee intreated in the still voice of the Gospell; but thou despisedst both. Remember how long he patiently hath waited for thy returning, but thou hast contemned the long-suffering of God calling to repentance,
and hardned thy selfe in thy rebellion. Remember how graciously hee stood knocking at thine care, to enter into thy heart, but thou hadst barred the entrance, and set it open for the world: then entred I in, and haue there kept possession to this howre. Know therefore thy Saviour is gone, thy time is past, and mercy is now out of season, and the judgements of God, and beginnings of hell haue taken hold of thee. But aboue all the rest, in that last and terrible day of the Lord, whither wilt thou turne thee when thou shalt heare; Take that slothfull (much more that lewd and rebellious) servant, and cast him into utter darkenesse: there shall bee weeping and gnashing of teeths. Where wilt thou seeke for helpe? from the world? It is all on fire, and all thy workes wherein thou delightedst. In thine owne heart? there thy conscience hath alreadie kindled the fire of hell. In the Saints? those thou derided'st on earth. In the good Angels? they defie thee as the enemie of God, and vassall of Satan. In the evill Angels whom thou served'st? they wrought thy damnation, and are thy tormenters. In that mercifull Saviour? the date of mercie is out, and this is the day of judgement, vengeance, and recompence. 1. Thy consorts are witnesses against thee. Thy conscience confesseth guiltie. 2. The heavens shut thee out, which thou in thy life neglectedst. Hell stands open for thee, the Angels detest thee, the Saints, even thine owne Father, Mother, and children abhorre thee, the frownes of that angry Iudge strike through thy soule with infinite horrour; and which is most fearefull, the gracious Saviour of all the world laughes at thy destruction: &amp; thou shalt heare him, who hath so long besought thee in vaine to bee reconciled to him, openly sentence thee,Mat. 25.41.

Oh that I might once liue againe, oh that at length I might die, oh death, oh anguish, oh hell, oh infinite torment without measure, without end! Oh that now there were an heart in us to consider our latter end.2 Cor. 5.11. 
                  Wee knowing the terrours of the Lord, desire to perswade you, and wee are made manifest to God, oh that wee were also made manifest to your consciences, that you might be worthy to escape all these things (Luk. 21. 36.) that you might lift up your heads with joy at that day, that wee that sow, and you that grow, we that reape, and you that are reaped, might rejoyce together.
               
                  
                  
                  
                     Exhortation
                  Let us therefore be exhorted to fasten first in our memorie, then in our heart this great and terrible day of the Lord. Let us set open our eares to those heavenly summons, and know that it is not in vaine that our Iudge, who desires to bee our Saviour, so often warnes us to take heed. Binde it as a signe upon thine hand, and set it as a frontlet betweene thine eyes; make thy soule to bee affected with it, that thou mayest feare, and depart from evill, and turne this terrible day to thy comfort and everlasting happinesse.
               Consider for motiues, first the great consequence depending on it. It is not a light matter, that little concernes thee: but thy life, or death, thy unspeakable happinesse or miserie (and that not for a day, but for ever) which then is in action. Now in great affaires we never content our selues with any measure of diligence: how shamefull and full of unbeliefe then is this negligence?
               Secondly; It is impossible to keepe our feete in the right way from errour, if we haue not this often in remembrance: for, as there are infinite wayes mis-leading us, so there is no meanes better to direct us in the right way, then by remembring our end.
               But how should we fasten this day in our hearts?
               
                  First by faith, perswading our hearts that this is truth, and to that end observing, not onely the frequent testimonies of the Lord in the word, but also the assent even of our reason, and the confession of our conscience, scoring up our faults against that day. Even the heathen themselues upon firme and undeniable grounds haue built this conclusion; now indeed when we beleeue it, and haue brought our hearts to yeeld unto it, we shall not easily forget it.
                  Secondly; Labour by prayer for sense and feeling of the Spirit, that God would take out this securitie and awake thy sluggish heart to wait upon him, and expect his comming.
               
               
                  
                  
                     Proposition 2. 
                     
                        Proposition
                     The sinners shall not stand in the congregation of the just.
                  For explication of the words, who are to bee accounted sinners was before delivered pag: 45. namely such as liue in any open and notorious breach of Gods commaundement.
                  Secondly; The Congregation signifieth here a certaine Assembly or societie of men gathered together, and so intends nothing else but the Church. Now the Church is diversly taken: sometime for the Catholike Church, that is, the whole bodie of Christ, comprising in it all the faithfull, from the first to the last member of his mysticall bodie living in the world. (Thus you will finde the word taken, Ephe. 1. 22. 23.) sometime for some member of that bodie, distinguished according to divers respects incident to it: thus the Church is divided into the triumphant, which raignes with Christ in heaven, or militant, which fights under his banner against sinne, the world and Satan here on earth. The militant Church hath many subdivisions, and is either visible in severall Congregations, professing openly the name of Christ; or invisible, which are the faithfull in those Congregations, confessing also in heart the Lord Iesus and his truth: who although (as men) are visible, and may bee discerned by any bodily eye, yet as the faithfull, and truely sanctified, cannot ordinarily or generally be distinguished from many hypocrites living with them in the same assemblies. So likewise the visible Church hath many branches: some greater as of a whole Province, so we distinguish the Greeke and Latine, East and West Churches; some lesser, as the Church confined to any one Citie; the Churth of Rome, the Church of Corinth; and some private, shut up in one familie, see Rom. 16. 5. Philem. 2. There is also a distinction of a true Church, which continues in all
fundamentall truth delivered by Christ and his Apostles; or false, which declines to some hereticall doctrines, and departs from the foundation, either from that rule of faith or manners: Thus as the Marcionits, Arrians, Macedonians, &amp;c. erring in matter of faith concerning the Godhead or manhood of Christ, or concerning the blessed Spirit. So the Nicolaitans maintaining filthy and promiscuous lusts, were false Churches, howsoever they were sound in divers other points of Christian doctrine. Now the Congregation here mentioned cannot be stretched to any other, but either the invisible, or tryumphant Church.
                  3. Lastly the just are those Saints of God, which being justified by the blood of Christ, are also sanctified by his Spirit.
                  
                  So the sense is. Howsoever here on earth wicked Atheists, heretickes, and hypocrites may come in sheepes cloathing, and not onely creepe into the flocke, but also rule and tyrannise in the visible Church, yet as they are no members of the true invisible Church, so when that great Shepheard shall separate the goats from the sheepe, these wolues in sheepes cloathing shall bee uncased, and cast out into their owne place with dogges.
                  
                  
                     Proofe.
                     
                        Proofe.
                      
                     Mat 25. ver. 31. to the end. Revel. 21. last ver. and 22. 14. 15.
                  The grounds are 1. In the nature of sinners;
                        Grounds.
                      Truth and lies, vertue and vice cannot stand together. As therefore in the creation there was a separation of light from darknesse, so in this perfect renovation.
                  2. From the nature of the Iudge, who is of pure eyes and cannot endure sinne, but is a consuming fire to such.
                  
                  3. From the time; It is the season when Christ shall wipe off all spots and wrinkles from his Church, but these are spots and blots in the Assemblies. 2 Pet. 2 13. Ephe. 5. 27.
                  
                     
                     
                        Instruction.
                     Here therefore is manifestly taught us, that no sinner that is, no man liuing in wilfull sinne, and maintaining it in his practise, is, or can be a true member of Christ, or his Church, but indeed a very spot, and blot in it. Tru

                     They were not of us, they were not all of us, see Math 7. 23. Hence called (as before) spots and blots. The reasons also, confirming this truth, are apparent. For first every member is, and cannot but be of the same nature with the head: monsters are they, which haue the head

Pet. 1. 4. see also Heb. 7. 26. Secondly he cannot be a member of Christ, who by the ordinances of God powerfully working on him by the Spirit, is not renewed, and changed. He that beleeueth, and is baptised, is saued, but he that beleeveth not is damned. We are buried in him by baptisme;Mark .16

                     cially, the loue of God to his Church, who as he hath sent his sonne to bring them out of the power of darkenesse, and the shadow of death, so also hath given his Spirit to guide and lead them into all truth, and his word as a touch-stone to try these spirits whether they are of God.
                  
                  Secondly; The vigilancie and care of those whom God hath set as watchmen, who being not hirelings but faithfull Pastors, doe not flie when they see the wolfe, but giue warning to the sheepe.
                  Thirdly; There is a spirit of discerning, Philip. 1. 10. which God poures out to the faithfull in divers measures according to their place which they hold in the body of Christ: to some more, to some lesse, to all some; so that
even babes to whom S. Iohn writes, may try the spirits whether they are of God. 1 Ioh. 4. 1. For even these, comparing the doctrine of these hypocrites either with the Scripture, or the rule of faith written by God in their hearts, and finding the disagreement can refuse and abhorre it, see 1 Ioh. 2. 19. 20. 21.
                  
                     
                     
                        Refutation.
                     Here is offered a very fit occasion to lay open the hypocrisie of that false Church, and her apostacie which challengeth to be not onely the true, but alone Church and Spouse of Christ, True it is, that as the body of that Antichristian Synagogue is covered with sheepes clothing, so the head hath put on the front of the Lambe, Rev. 13.11. but indeed the body when it is stript, easily discovers it selfe to be the beast, and the head when it speakes in the doctrine proclaimes the Dragon. You shall know these false Prophets which come in sheepes clothing by their fruits,

                         7. 16. that is by their teaching, which is the proper fruit of a Teacher. They teach perverse things saith the Apostle, (Acts 20. 30
                        •
                     ) to draw Disciples not after Christ, but after themselues. How by their traditions and vaine inventions they haue made the word of God of no effect, may appeare by these few points of their religion.
                  But first let us remember that Pietie consisteth either in inward or outward duties to God: the one being as the soule, the other as the body of religion. Of the first those are principall, knowledge, loue, feare of God, faith in him, and his word. Of the second, Prayer, hearing the word, administration of the holy mysteries, and right observation of the Sabboth. Now how grossely the Papists in their doctrines haue perverted all these parts of Gods worship, may very briefly appeare to them who will duely consider it. For knowledge, they deliver that hellish proposition, Ignorance is the mother of devotion, to which their other doctrines and practise are squared; labouring to hold the mindes of their people in grosse darkenesse, and therfore not onely forbidding on great penalties the common acquaintance and use of scriptures, but affirming, that he is a
friend to heretikes, who maintaines an ordinary reading of Scripture:

                         3. art. 4. nay that it is pernicious and impious. For loue, they haue utterly broken the bond of spirituall marriage; First by that Saint-adoration, deifying holy men, and allowing them Altars, prayers &amp;c. Secondly, also by their digressing and wilfull departing from the word, and Ordinances of Christ, which is a manifest breach of loue: Ioh. 14. 24. For the feare of God, (the very bond of our Covenant, Ier. 32. 40.) first they haue made it in vaine by the traditions of men, Esay 29. 13. Secondly, in place of that filiall feare (knitting our soules to him in reverend loue) they plant an hellish feare of God in the hearts of their people, to be afraid to approach unto him by prayer, as being a great King, and a rigide observer of all that is amisse. For faith, they haue wholy unsinued it, not onely in teaching faith (and prayer of faith) to creatures, as a right object of both, but delivering no other faith, then that which is common to many reprobates and Devils.
                  For that second kinde, their invocation of Saints, asking of them, whatsover a creature should aske of God: the neglect and contempt of the word, setting up against it, the false light of their traditions, perverting the Sacraments, despising the Sabboth (a sinne so notorious among them and maintained) make evident what religion they professe, and whence they had it. But especially obserue their rejecting of Christ in all his o

                     itles,1 Pet. 5.3. and exercise of Lordly authoritie to his very Apostles; they doe not onely ascribe full power to the Pope over the universall Church on earth, nay under the earth also (namely that which they dreame to be in a purgatorie) yea even of that which is in heaven, (forSo Clement 5 they take upon them to commaund
Angels:) but also call him openly (and justifie those titles) the head, the Monarch, and Spouse of the whole Church. Nay saith Bellarmine;
                        Bellar de eccles. lib. 3. c. 5. 
                     Hee is the supreame head, to giue outward influence of doctrine, faith, and Sacraments. Secondly; for the Priesthood of Christ, they abase that perfect sacrifice, and whereas the Scripture so highly prefers it before the Leviticall, they as low depresse it by the same argument
                        •
                      namely the frequent, and indeed infinite repeatings of it; and to supply it, they adde their owne satisfactions and merits, whereby they remoue temporall punishments, and haue invented a new sacrifice of Christ, unbloodie, and a new priesthood of Masmongers. Thirdly whereas Christ is our onely Prophet, or Teacher Mat. 23. 8. so that men and Angels are accursed who bring any other doctrine, they haue so tied the eare of the Church to the tongue of the Pope, that they do not only ascribe unto him an u

There are many who imagine themselues free from those grosse, and apparent sinnes of the time, or at least from that measure which they see, or suppose to see in others, and consider themselues in the f

Aboue the rest, negligence in performance of dutie they account as nothing: as demaund of them, what zeale haue you in prayer? what hnnger for the word? what diligence in service? what thirst of righteousnesse? what longing after God? They cannot denie that they are very deficient, nay indeed that they haue no sense of these things. And alas! dost thou not know, that sentence is past for sinnes of omission? Mat. 25. Dost thou not know that the curse belongs to those, who doe the worke of God negligently, Ier. 48. 10.

                     Learne here to know thy estate and thy selfe, and shake off that securitie of men in a matter of such importance: goe upon sure grounds, and such as cannot deceiue thee, And for motiues remember;

                        First; That a wise-man will bee diligent to know the estate of his flocke, and of his heards:Pro. 27. 23. a man that is carefull to thriue in the world, must often cast up his account: and is it not more needfull to know the estate of thy soule?
                        
                           Secondly; Thou knowest not how suddainely the day of thy account shall come, or whether then the Lord will giue thee any leasure or heart to doe it, or whether hee will then suffer thee to come nigh him.
                     
                  
                  But what meanes are to bee used?
                  First, learne not to trust in thine owne heart,Ier. 17. 9. for it is deceitfull aboue all things. Remember Prov. 12. 15. and 14. 12. The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes, but hee that heareth counsell is wise. Secondly, take the word of God in thine hand,Heb. 4. 12. and apply thy heart to that rule: It will discover thy heart to thy eyes, for God hath purposely given it to this

               Psalme I. Verse VI. For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, but the way of the ungodly shall perish.
               
                  IN the former verses the Prophet having discovered the good and evill way, and the issue of both; now in the conclusion by a necessarie argument confirmes all that truth, and giues an evident reason, why the godly who seeke the Lord in his word and wayes cannot but prosper and be blessed: and the wicked that despise God, and walke after their owne lusts cannot but come to confusion: namely, because God knowes the way of the righteous, and the way of the ungodly shall perish. The first proposition is.

                  Because God knowes the wayes of the righteous, therefore shall they prosper and bee blessed.
               
               Two words must be opened, first what is ment by the way of the righteous; secondly what kinde of knowledge is here intended.
               For the former, though there is here a double figure, 
                     •
                  irst a metaphor, where the soule directing the continuall course of our actions, according to the rule of God is resembled to the body, walking in some tracke, or path, and a metonymie, where the way is put for a continuall walking or stepping in the way, yet is so ordinary, not
onely in the Scripture commonly used by the Spirit, but in our speech to compare the life, or practise of any man in any trade temporall or spirituall to a way, and so to call it, that it shall need no further labour in explication.
               The other, what this knowledge is in God, hath more difficultie and needs more unfolding; Knowledge,

                     •
                  rstanding, but more largely extended to other faculties of the soule, even the will and affections. In which generall acception it may be described, that action of any of the reasonable faculties, namely understanding, will, or affection, whereby that facultie apprehends any thing and applies it selfe unto it. For looke as in the bodily senses they are then said to heare or see, when the object of the eare and eye entring into them is by them apprehended and applied; For example: The 
                     •
                  are is said to know what is spoken, when it apprehends the words, &amp; applies it selfe in the facultie of hearing unto the voice: the eye to know the colour, which it lets in, and exerciseth it selfe in beholding: so when the understanding, will, and affections busie their severall offices in applying their powers to any thing, they may not bee un
                     •
                  itly said to know it. Now therefore as when the understanding apprehends any intelligible object, and applies the facultie of discerning unto it, it is said to know it: so when the will whose o
                     •
                  fice is to choose or refuse,See Amos 3. 10. applies it selfe to the object in chusing, then the will may bee said to know. So likewise wee may say the affections know that which they loue or honour. Thus man is said to know God, 1. when the Lord having revealed himselfe and his will in his word, the understanding (applying it s
                     •
                  lfe to this object, and receiving into it selfe this revelation) perceiues it. Thus it is used Psal. 9. 10. They that know thee will trust in thee, &amp;c. Thus it is said, The heathens know not Gods judgements, as being never revealed to them, nor they perceiving them, Psal. 147. 20. 2. When he chuseth
the Lord to bee his God; So 1 Chron. 28. 9. Know the God of thy fathers, that chose him, and set him up in thy heart to be thy God. 3 when he loueth and feareth God. Thus the sonns of Eli are said to be wicked that knew not God. 1 Sam. 2. 12; and some-times all these included in one, as Iohn. 17. 3. This is life eternall to know thee the onely true God, and whom thou hast sent Iesus Christ: that is, to know thee with the understanding, and Iesus Christ by conceiving those things which are revealed of God the father, and the Lord Iesus Christ, to know with the will, and affections by chosing, and loving thee, testified in all obedience, is life eternall. Thus likewise God is said to know men, or the wayes of men, not onely because he knowes, and searches the heart, and understandeth the thoughts Psal. 94. 11. but because he chuseth any people Amos .4. 2. and because he loveth, and delighteth in any: Psal. 144. 3.
               Thus then is the sense of the words. Because God seeth
                        •
                      choseth, and loveth the wayes of a righteous man, therefore he shall prosper, and be blessed.
               
               
                  
                     Proofe.
                  The point is evidently here a
                     •
                  firmed, and will further be cleered in that which followes.
               
                  
                     Grounds.
                  So likewise the grounds are apparent, 1. In God, 2. or opposite creatures. In God his infinite power, in the enemies their subiection, and weaknes. For lay down this first as a confessed truth: God sees, choses, loves the wayes of righteous men, secondly he is of infinite power, doing whatsoeuer he will in heauen, and earth. Thirdly no creature able to resist, and hence necessarily will follow this effect, therefore shall they prosper, and be blessed.
               
               
                  
                  
                     Instruction.
                  1 The Lord vnderstandeth, and seeth all the wayes of righteous persons: whatsoever dutie they performe in obedience to any of his commandements, though in secret, and in the heart, he discerns and will reward it openly Psal. 139. 1.2. 3. 4. Math. 6.4.6. 1. Cor. 4. 5. Heb. 4.13. Much, and every way profitable use haue the

                  Saints made of this truth; hence some haue fenced themselues from many tentations, and kept their hearts whole and sound, Ioseph (Gen. 39. 9.) hauing his eye on the eye of God, preserved his body from his Mystres unchast allurements. Some haue hence learned to denie themselues, and to prefer the rebuke of Christ before all earthly treasures, as Moses. Heb. 11.26. But of especiall use is it for consolation, as well against tyrants, and bloody persecutours, as Psal. 35. 13. 14 15. 17. 22. 24. as against terrours of death. Thus Hezekiah helde up his head, and lifted up to God a confident, and effectuall prayer even after the message of death, Esa. 38.3. How great a comfort would it be to a servant or childe, when he had offended, or failed in dutie, that his master or Father could see the unfeyned sorrow of his heart, or could discerne how strongly he desires to doe stronger service? This comfortable advantage haue all the Saints: they serue such a Lord to whom they may truely (as David) say, What can David say more unto thee? for thou Lord knowest thy servant. 2 Sam. 7.20. or as Peter, Thou knowest that I loue thee, Ioh. 21. 17. And indeed how should it bee otherwise?Psa. 94.9. 10.

                        •
                      knowledge shall hee not know? How is it possible that the Creator should not know the creature?Pro. 16.1. 2. He in whose hand are the preparations of the heart, and the answer of the tongue, he who pondereth the Spirits, how should he be unacquainted with any thing in man. Secondly; As the Lord is every where present, is not, nor can be excluded from any place, th
                        •
                      heaven of heavens cannot containe him, 2. Chron. 6. 18. so is he especially present with the faithfull. God dwells in the humble: Christ dwells in the faithfull, Ephe. 3. 17.Esay 57. 15. 
                  They are the Temple of God, and the holy Ghost dwells in them. 1 Cor. 3. 16. being even the soule of their soule, quickning them Iohn 6. 63. freeing them, and bringing to libertie, 2 Cor. 3. 17. teaching, and prompting them, Ioh. 14.26. and strengthning them, Ephe. 3. 16.
               
                  
                   2
                     •
                   The Lord chuseth out the righteous for himselfe, and their paths for them; preordaining, setting out, and preparing their way in which they shall walke, and ordering their steps in that way.Psal. 4. 3. 
                  The Lord chuseth the godly man: God will teach those that feare him the way which hee chuseth.
                  Psal. 25. 12. See Ephe. 2. 10. where we easily perceiue, that as God culls out the faithfull,Esay 30. 21. so doth he set out all their workes for them, and prepares them, not onely laying downe this way plainely in his word, but writing it in the hearts of his people, giving them also the will and deed: see Esay 26. 12. As he doth not create them to bee idle, or viciously employed, so hee purposely maketh them new creatu
                     •
                  es, that they may walke in newnesse of life. This that they may doe, he ordaineth good wayes and sets them out for them, and leads them along to the end, having prepared both the way and end for them. Looke as a wise loving father considering his childes disposition, appoints, fits and traines him to some calling which he thinks well of, and in which hee may prosper: so the Lord having graciously called any to his knowledg according to his owne loue and wisedome sets out and makes readie for them that which he knowes most fit and convenient. And necessarily is it that the Lord should effect this for his children. For;

                     
                        Iere. 10.23.First, The way of man is not in himselfe, neither is it in man to direct his steps. If the
                           •
                        fore they had no better Guid
                           •
                         then themselues, they could not prosper in their wayes.
                     Secondly, There are so many difficulties, snares, and stumbling blocks in the way layd, and hid by Satan and his instruments, that they must needs fall, unlesse the Lord should beare them up and sustaine them. Thus hee prepares the way, streitens the crooked turnings, and smooths the roughnesse, Luk. 3. 4. 5. and puts under his hand, when they are readie to fall, Psal 37. 24.
                     Thirdly, Satan and his followers, principalities and powers, and worldly governours are their professed enemies in this journey, resisting them in all good actions, and
fighting with all their armies to stop, and hinder them that they may never enter into the land of promise, Zach. 3. 1. Ephe. 6. 12.
                  
               
               3. The Lord doth loue and honour not onely the persons  of all his Saints
                     •
                   but their wayes also: with an everlasting loue haue I loved thee, see Pro. 15. 9. and Psal. 37. 23. 24. The Lord loveth the way of the righteous, though hee fall hee shall not bee cast off.
                  Ier. 31. 3. So likewise hee honours those that honour him, 1 Sam. 2. 30. Rom. 2. 10.Psal. 147.11. 
                  Such honour haue all his Saints. The reason of this is plaine and necessarie.
               
                  First, God is himselfe infinitely righteous, &amp; therefore cannot but loue and honour righteous wayes &amp; persons: Psal. 33.4. 5. Nothing is a more effectuall motiue of loue, then the likenesse and neerenesse of qualitie and studies: even neerenesse of blood yeeldeth to this, and stronger amitie hath beene contracted by likenesse of manners, then by any other respect.
                  Secondly, Righteous persons and wayes are the principall workes of God; we are his new creatures, and all our good workes are wholy framed by him: He makes us know what is good, he giues us a good will to good, and then perfects it in good actions. Now God loveth all his workes. If we looke over all the holy histories, wee shall find this truth wonderfully confirmed in the dealing of God with his people: especially in that of David, who being after Gods heart, and bending all his studie to magnifie the name, and advance the worship of God, was againe magni
                        •
                     ied, and much loved and honoured, see 2 Sam. 7. 8. 9.
               
               
                   4. We learne here the infallible happinesse of the righteous: for se
                     •
                  ing this knowledge, of God is the cause of their bless

                  m, and all their wayes, so certainely shall they a
                     •
                  taine the state here mentioned and promised, Psal. 112. 1. so Mat. 5. 3.4. 5. 6. &amp;c. As th
                     •
                  refore Isaack speakes concerning Iacob, I have blessed him, therefore hee
shall bee blessed, Gen. 27.33. Or as Iacob of his beloved Ioseph, Gen. 49. 26. The blessing of thy father shall be stronger then the blessing of mine elders; unto the ends of the hills of the world shall they be upon the head of Ioseph, &amp;c. so much more strong, much more lasting are the blessings of God upō his beloved childrē: for who shal or can curse wher God hath not cursed? Num. 23.8. such places are infinite; especially obserue that sentence, Prov. 3. 13. Blessed is hee that findeth wisedome. Consider the words before, and following
                     •
                   the meaning is; As a Merchant who by continuall travell and trafficke, hath found and gotten for himselfe much gold and silver, and all manner of earthly goods, is alreadie rich, and in the supposall of earthly men well to passe, so that man who hath laboured in the word, and trading with it, hath attained that true wisedome consisting in holinesse, is blessed in his worke: see Iam. 1. 25. And the same reason setleth this their blessednesse: for the Lord is unchangeable, his seeing them, loving their wayes is unalterable: therefore so must their estate bee, which (as before is manifest) fadeth not, 2 Tim. 2. 19. The reasons also manifesting this truth are divers, as;

                     First; That absolute decree, promise, and truth of God, which every where hee hath published in his word, who cannot lie or dissemble, and will not reverse any thing hee hath spoken. Hath hee sayd and shall not hee doe it, Numb. 23. 19.
                     Secondly; That constant and unchangeable loue of God, Ioh. 13. 1. who repents not of his gifts, Rom. 11. 29. but bestowes one that he may make way for another, and delighteth to heape upon him abundance, who hath received any grace, Mat. 13. 12. Blessings (indefinitely) are upon the head of the righteous, Prov. 10. 6.
                     Thirdly; That permanent grace of God, that remaining seed, 1 Ioh. 3. 9. which according to the tenor of the new Covenant is not fading nor subject to losse: They shall not depart from God, &amp; therefore received that last bond of the covenant,Iere. 32.40. the feare of God, which endureth for ever, Ps. 19.9.
Certaine is it that as worldly man thirsting for gaine, when hee hath betaken himselfe to some good trade, and findes it sweet, is now and every day more eager of the world then before: so where God hath seasoned the heart with this spirituall and heavenly covetousnesse of the world to come, the riches of grace and glorie, the more he employeth his labour in Gods ordinances, and faithfully seekes, the more according to Gods promise he findes; the more he findes, the sweeter still it feeles, and this sweetnesse is a more sharpe spur to his hungry soule: hence he is whetted more earnestly to pursue, hence the more hee obtaines; and growes every day more blessed.
                  
               
               
                  
                  
                     Reproofe.
                  1. Now therefore not onely wicked and profane persons are here reproved, such, who because they haue not God before their eyes, thinke not that God hath them in his eyes; such as say, God hath forgotten he hideth away his face, and will never see: such as despise God, and say, hee will not regard: Psal. 10. 11. 13. such fooles, as confesse God made their seeing eyes and hearing eares, yet thinke he never sees nor perceiues: see Psal. 94. 7. 8. 9. But as these, so many other holy and faithfull Christians are here to bee chidden, who are often deepely plunged into many bottomlesse tentations, and even swallowed with griefe, because they forget this comfortable truth, and doe not consider in the evill day, that the Lord hath seene, and written up for them all their labour of loue: hee hath recorded and keepeth tale of their sighs, and bottles up their teares as a memoriall for them. For in the cloudie and darke day, when Satan drawes their eyes wholy either to the sinfull actions which they haue committed, or to their sinfull affections yet remaining, and fighting, and oft prevailing in them, they make no question but God sees all their misdeeds and sinnes, but that the Lord should behold their spirits sighing under the burthens, groaning under this oppression of Satan, that hee should in mercie, compassion, and loue behold the wrastlings,
struglings, and the bitter griefe of their hearts thus yoked with the body of death, they utterly forget. But because they despise their owne poore and weake endeavors, as being low in their owne eyes, they suppose they are also despised by God. This we must carefully amend, &amp; fasten this truth in our memories, that the Lord cannot despise his owne worke in his creatures, but sees &amp; perfectly knowes all the thoughts of our heart, so that our desires thirsting for his righteousnesse, and our cries calling out to bee delivered from this woefull yoke-fellow of sinfull corruption, are all heard and noted by him.
               
                  
                  
                     Reproofe.
                  So likewise are here many to be rebuked, who make no good use of that doctrine so plainly, and comfortably layde down by the Spirit, and frequently handled in the scripture, namely the election, and predestination of the Saints. Some are so impudent, that they would wholy silence this truth, not considering, that things revealed belong to us and our children.
                  Deut. 29. 2
                        •
                     . Some even devillishly blaspheme it, as a dangerous, and desperate doctrine, which driveth men to hell, and desperation. Others eschew it as a rocke, and dare not touch, or meddle with it: and very few who make right use of it. Certainely as it is very full of use for the faithfull for humiliation, as remembring that God chuseth their persons, yet not being, before they are called, before they know him; that he predestinates all their workes for them, and ordereth them to their handes, that he giues wil and deed, in a word, that he foresees us, loues us, out of his loue prepares us for grace, and then giveth it, when he hath fitted us for it, and all this without promeriting, nay any concurrance on our part, that after he worketh in us, and perfits what hee begins, and crowns what he hath perfited, and for our consolation, that it is not in him that willeth or runneth, but in God that shewes mercie, and not for our righteousnes, but because he hath chosen, us, that his purpose according to election may stand
not of workes, but of him that calleth:Rom. 9. 11. so is there great use of it in wicked persons, for warning, and caution. Neither can I see how any desperate person can pervert this, but in the like manner he may abuse any other doctrine to his destruction; as the Papists this day abuse that point of justification by faith, and not by workes, and many other: we must therefore not onely retaine this truth, but apply it to that end for which it was given by God, making our calling and election sure.
               
               
                   3. So also the neglect and despising of that truth (namely that the Lord doth loue and honour the persons and wayes of godly men) is here reproved. Hence might wicked men tremble to see how hatefull and abominable their wayes and persons are in his sight, who can recompence, and surely will reward them according to their workes. And how justly might thousands of Christians tremble, when they see their affections in this particular so contrary to Christ? For they account basely of those whom God honours, hate those whom God loues, shew to them all contempt and malice in reviling, slandering, or any abuse that they can or dare offer. What member of Christ art thou, who despisest such as thy head hath crowned with his heavenly Kingdome? How farre from a Christian, who hast no loue to such whom Christ hath loved beyond his life? So also by forgetting this lesson many depriue themselues of much comfort. For how much joy might the weake Christian gather here, if hee did continually remember; He that hath given mee an heart to loue him, he first loved me, he hath set his heart upon me for good, and therfore hath drawn me from my wicked &amp; vaine conversation to serue him? and if he hath loved me when I was an enemie, will he forsake me now he hath seasoned my heart with some measure of loue, and desire of his service? What a cordiall would this bee against all the revilings, contempts, and despitefull usage of the world? we are therefore much to blame, that we make no better use of a truth so full of profit and consolation.
               
                  
                  
                  
                     Comfort.
                  Hence may the faithfull soule in any necessitie and upon all occasions draw endlesse comfort. How did this hearten David in all persecution of Saul, and slanders of his enemies? Psal. 18. 10. &amp;c. Psal. 7. 3. &amp;c. yea indeed in all his trouble: nay when he found his tongue unable in that dutie of thankfulnesse to poure out his heart (2 Sam. 7. 20
                     •
                  ) this yet offered him much consolation, Thou Lord knowest thy servant. The like see in Ieremie in much tentation, and many grievances, Ier. 12. 3. Especially remember Iob, who when hee was assaulted on everie side, without and within, his friends accusing him of hypocrisie and fighting craftily against his faith: the enemie bringing all the terrours of God in a full armie against him, and making him possesse the iniquities of his youth: yet could uphold his soule, and keepe it from sinking in this storme with the remembrance of this truth, and strongly applying it to his heart, found powerfull consolation in this; He knoweth my way and tryeth me. That excellent Apostle persecuted by bloodie Infidels,Iob 23. 10. 
                  Iewes, and Heathen, slandered, and wronged by false Brethren, nay too little esteemed by his owne children in the Spirit, accounted the off-scouring of all things, could fully satisfie his owne soule, and comfortably wait on God on this knowledge, God was his witnesse: 1 Thes. 2. 13. and could therefore 
                     •
                  light that censure of man 1 Cor. 3. 3. 5. Wee should therefore apply this for comfort, when we are reviled as hypocrites by the world, or inwardly accused by Satan, that God sees and will judge; when we are despised by men, that God hath chosen us; when we, and our actions in Gods service are hated and abased, that God hath loved and honoured both.
               
                  
                  
                     Exhortation
                  Labour for such wayes as are acceptable to God, such as he hath chosen, and commended; such as he loues, and honoureth. For motiues, oh remember thy heart is very deceitfull, and will easily blind thee with counterfeit shewes, and false hopes if thou lookest not very narrowly to it. Learne therefore of this Saint to consider thy paths, and
with hast putting away delayes, to turne thy feete into the wayes of God.
                  Psal. 119.59. 60. Say with thy selfe; All the wayes of man are cleane in his owne eyes,
                  Pro. 16. 2. and 21.2. 
                  but the Lord weigheth the spirits: Every way of man is right in his owne eyes, but the Lord pondereth the hearts. Now what shall it profit mee, if I as those vaunting Pharises justifie my selfe, when the Lord knowes and condemnes me? what good shall I reape from man, that my actions are highly esteemed in the world, when they are abomination to God?Luke 16.15. Let mee never forget that there is a way seeming right unto man but the issues thereof are the wayes of death: thinke with thy selfe what horrour will assaile and daunt thee in that day, when having securely trusted in thine owne heart and wayes, thine eyes are at length opened to see thine errour, that thou and all thy workes are hated and detested by the Lord. Consider what infinite comfort and joy will spring in thy heart in all estates, yea the most afflicted, when thou canst say in truth, that thou hast tryed and weighed thy pathes before they come to that great trya
                     •
                  l, to bee pondered by the Lord; and hast unfainedly taken up those wayes, and walked in them uprightly with thy best endevour, which God himselfe hath chosen and set for thee, and will accept in his mercie. Learne therefore to trust in the Lord with all thy heart,Pro. 3. 5. 6. 
                  and leane not to thine owne wisedome: in all thy wayes acknowledge him, and hee shall direct thy wayes.
               
               
                  
                     Proposition 2. But the way of the ungodly shall perish.
                  In the former words the Prophet giues an infallible reason why the faithfull shall prosper in their wayes, and bee blessed: here also he useth a necessary argument, why the ungodly cannot haue good successe, nor ever attaine to happinesse. Now how soever he leaues out the Antithesis or opposite axiom to the former, God knowes not the
way of ungodly men; yet is it here without question to be understood. I will therefore handle it fully, and annexe the cause with the effect in this intire proposition.
                  
                     
                     
                        Proposition
                     
                     God knowes not the way of the ungodly, therefore they &amp; their wayes shall perish.
                  
                  The words haue beene before sufficiently cleered: as well who are the ungodly, what also is ment by their wayes is evident enough; their thoughts, counsels, enterprises, nay also their outward dignitie, glory, authoriritie, &amp;c. So likewise what this knowledge is may be easily discerned, namely, the Lord indeed knowes to take notice of them for their confusion, but to approue or respect them knoweth them not. Lastly, that is said to perish, which attaines not the end to which it is aymed, but comes to nothing.
                  The meaning is; The Lord also sees all the devises and plots of wicked persons rejects, despises, and hates them, and their wayes, therefore they shall certainely bee destroyed and consumed.
                  
                  
                     
                        Proofe.

                        Grounds.
                     
                     Grounds, as in the former proposition so here, are;

                        First, the over-ruling power of God, who doth whatsoever he will.
                        
                        Secondly, the weakenesse of his enemies, not able to resist,Psal. 110. 1. as being (even the proudest of them, and most rebellious) 
                              •
                           his foot-stoole.
                        Thirdly, his infinite justice, which cannot hold the guiltie innocent, Exod. 34. 7.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     
                        Instruction.
                     1. Whatsoever is in the wicked, whatsoever belongs to them, or is done by them, is rejected, despised, and even scorned by God. For their persons;Psal. 2. 4. &amp; 5. 5. 
                     Hee that dwells in heaven shall laugh, the Lord shall haue them in derision. The foole shall not stand in thy sight, thou hatest all them that worke iniquitie.
                     Pro. 3.34. Pro 10. 3. 
                     With the scorner he scorneth. For their estate; Hee casteth away the substance of the wicked: for the lust of the eyes, the pompe and splendour of the wicked, and the pride of life is of the world; hatefull therefore
to God. Nay if we looke to their religion, it is a burden, and hatefull:Esa. 1. 13. 14. 
                     Incense is abomination to mee, I hate your new moones, &amp;c. their sacrifices abominable: their best workes b
                        •
                     t glittering sinnes,Pro. 15. 8. as sayes truely that good Father: in which respect our Saviour a
                        •

                     that which is highly esteemed among men to bee abomination in the sight of God. Hence God more commends a poore child, then an old King which refuses admonition. Verily even in that most meeke Lambe of God,
                     Eccles. 4. 13. we cannot but see a wonderfull hate and scorn of reprobate wicked persons, even of those which were most magnified among men, either in regard of their temporall or spirituall estate. How contemptuously doth he speake of Herod?

                  The reasons also necessarily concluding this truth are evident: for if we consider the ungodly either in their persons, estates, or actions, there is in them all the true object of rejection, hate, and sc

                     rne: and if we looke upon God, as he hath described himselfe in his word, wee cannot but see in him those excellent properties, wch necessarily thus worke upon such an object. For what is the object of rejection but evill? Now the ungodly are evill in their persons, states, actions; There is no good in them, Rom. 7. 18. but a continuall course of evill, Gen. 6. 5. So what is the object of hate but contrarietie? And wicked men are in all things contrarie to God; contrary to his holinesse, hee light they darkenesse: hee infinitely pure, they wholy and extreamly polluted: contrary to him in his rule and government, ever resisting and rebelling. What is the object of scorne, but folly and proud beggerie?
Such are all the wicked: continually called fooles by the wisedome of God, and most justly; for certainely naturalls are not so sottish in things temporall, as they in spirituall and eternall. They are beggars, having nothing but almes from God, not a bit of bread, not a mouth to put it in; yet so brutishly proud, that they despise the Giver,Heb. 1.13.

                      so likewise see Esa. 8. 9. 10. For their pomp, honour, and glory,Psal. 49.11. 12. 17. 
                     They thinke their houses shall continue for ever, and call their landes by their names, but mad shall not continue in honour: he is like the beasts that dy. He shall take nothing a way, when he dieth his pompe shall not desend after him.
                     Esay 54.14. 
                     Hell hath enlarged it selfe, and hath opened his mouth with out measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pompe, and he that reioiceth among them shall desend into it. Nay all their hopes die with them. When a wicked man dies, all his hope perishes.
                     Pro. 11.7. This truth is very frequently exemplified in the scripture: especially in those wicked Kings, and many other persons: see also Ier. 22. from the 13. verse to the 20. Consider the rich man in the Gospell. Luk. 12. 18. 19. and 1 Thes: 5. 3. Herod in all his pomp is smitten, and dies eaten with

                  Secondly as their persons, so their counsels, and enterprises, and all their authoritie is set against God, and are contrary to him, now two contraries cannot consist together, but one shall fall: but as God himselfe lives for ever, so his counsell shall stand for ever Pro. 19. 21. and Ier. 44. 28. Ezech. 1. 6. And evident is it, that their wisdome is enmitie with God, it cannot therefore but perish.

It is therefore impossible there should bee a God, and that ungodly persons, counsels, and actions should prosper: but seing God his counsell, decrees, and honour must stand, theirs must fall. Haman, and Mordecai cannot stand together, much lesse God and ungodly persons. They are but as a potters vessell, and he crushes them with a scepter of iron, they cannot therefore but be broken in peices.

that they liue, and so purpose to liue in this estate? they can denie neither: yet shall no perswasion bring them out from their resolution, but thus they haue, and thus they will continue. They heare the threatning, and thundring word of God.

For either they denie God in their hearts, or at least (which is all one) fancie him idle, and not regarding, without any care or providence; or else they giue no credit in heart to those threats and promises of God. Certainely many delude themselues with a conceit of mercie even in the highest rebellion, and especially with the thought of turning at better leasure; nothing doubting but that if they haue time to say, Lord haue mercie on mee, all will be well with them. In humane affaires, because the displeasure of the Prince is as the roaring of a Lion, hence whatsoever may bring them into disgrace, they will carefully avoid, and if they haue incurred his anger, what will they not doe to appease his wrath, and procure his favour? But their contrarie behaviour to God, cannot but argue a contrary perswasion.

                     n beastly sencelesnesse of professed Christians this way, with what incredible paines and delight they follow after the fading world: If either the word had not made them know, or their owne experience confirmed to them the vanity and vexation of all earthly things; if they knew not they should carrie nothing away with them, there might bee some shew of excuse in such people: But when they denie not that truth; yet to take such paines for a fading, vexing vanitie, which even now in it selfe is nothing worth (but in the eyes of fooles,) and instantly will bee nothing at all; is more folly then can sute with a reasonable creature. For to seeke and search for wicked riches and pleasures, that is, to pursue our owne destruction, what madnesse is beyond it? what marvaile to see a foole, child, or Lunatike to delight in some hurtfull thing? Alas they want the use of that reason which should direct them! But for a creature able to use his reason, for a Christian that enjoyes the light of understanding, nay of the word and Spirit, thus to do at, it passeth the conceit of a man how they should bee wrought to it. Can any man plead ignorance, and say?Pro. 23. 5. I knew not that I should forsake this life, and the appurtenances of it; I knew not that riches haue wings as an Eagle: I knew not it was as a spiders webbe? Esay 59. 6. Iob 8. 14. 15. that my honours, profits, pleasures should perish, and all my thoughts and labours vanish like a cloud? What Christian but must confesse? I know that good men shall leaue an inheritance to their childrens children, but the riches of the wicked are layd up for the just.

                     Nay the happinesse of the wicked shall destroy them: yet will they by fraud, cousonage, oppression, lies, perjuries, and all manner of wickednesse, labour
to inrich themselues, and bee loaded with thicke clay. How true and fearefull is that saying,Pro. 21.6. 
                     That gathering of treasures by a deceitfull tongue is vanitie tossed to and fro of them that seeke death. Our experience of Gods curse upon such wicked substance hath begotten a proverbe, that ill got goods never prosper: yet as if joy, comfort, life, and happinesse wholy consisted in earthly things, so doe men runne and poast after them.

                     To shut up all in a word of exhortation: use all diligence, and labour to come out of this cursed estate. I do not wish thee to looke out, and long for happinesse: nature, and selfe loue will enforce this desire; and thou canst as well remoue hunger, and thirst from thy body, as this wish of happines from thy soule. But as thou desirest to be blessed: so seeke it in the right way. Hearken not to ungodly counsels: giue no credit to the vaine perswasions of unexperienced guides, never acquainted with true blessednes, or the way that leads to it Trust in the Lord thy God:

Doth not thy excellencie consist in likenesse to thy Creator and Redeemer, and in his divine nature? and how then should sinfull men, and counsels, directing thee, or rather plunging thee in the mirie wayes of worldly Mammon, wicked riches, advancements, and pleasures, bring thee to this thy happinesse. When I heare or read of an humane creature mingling himselfe with a beast, I disdaine, loath, I detest his filthinesse; and account him for the greater beast of the twaine, eve

Oh then learne with an holy disdaine to scorne, that thou in thy understanding, will, and affections, shouldst be wholy employed in the world, and setled on earth, where thou hast no mansion. But follow thou the conduct of this experienced Guide the holy Prophet, and that more perfect Leader the most holy Spirit. Set and settle thy affections upon these things, which will deserue them. Turne the streame of thy covetousnes to covet spirituall gifts. 1. Cor. 14.1. Take off thy ambitious desires from the world, and let this be all thy ambition,2 Cor. 5. 9. that both dwelling at home, and removing from home, thou mayst bee acceptable to him. Is there not another world, another life, another food, rayment, treasures, another inheritance, another Lord of all flesh, and spirits: who is over all, and in all. Is not his loue better then life? Psal. 63. 3. And are not all these spirituall, immortall, and glorious? were it not madnes then in thee, being an immortall spirit, to forsake all these, and cleaue to earth? Is not Christ thy life, nourishment of thy life, thy meate, and drinke indeede? Is not he thy glorious covering? Oh then put on the Lord Iesus, and take no thought for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts of it. It is thy Saviours voyce which invites

It is that which will nourish thee in it:1 Pet. 1. 23. and 2. 2. that which will build thee up, and giue thee an inheritance among those that are sanctified.
