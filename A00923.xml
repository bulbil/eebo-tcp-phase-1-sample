            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               and you ſhall truely know,
               How valliantly our Noble friends,
               their foes did ouerthrow.
            
            
               The Archduke of Auſtria,
               
               that bloudy Spaniſh Lord:
               Like Iudas hath conuerted,
               his booke into a ſword.
               To plant by curſed Popery,
               in Flaunders now againe:
               to bring the Quéen of Englāds friends
               in ſeruitude to Spaine.
            
            
               But Noble Prince, Graue Maurice,
               
               his purpoſe to preuent:
               Hath entred famous Flaunders,
               to warlike battle bent:
               With fiftéene thouſand horſe and foote,
               prepared well to fight:
               At Phillipeena landed firſt,
               the twelfe of Iune by night.
            
            
               From thence a long to Oldenbirdge,
               they marched on a maine:
               And cut of all the beſt reliefe,
               quite from the hoaſt of Spaine.
               All the ſconces and the Fortes,
               that by the way they found,
               Belonging to the Spaniſh power,
               they raced to the ground.
            
            
               And ſo to Newport marched,
               with thundring lowde allarmes:
               And there beſiegde it brauely,
               by force of warlike armes.
               The Cannons plaide vp to the walles
               the muſkets ſhot amaine:
               As though that Mars himſelfe were come
               to fight or elſe be ſlaine.
            
            
               By this he heard the Archduke,
               was comming for to raiſe
               His ſiedge, with full ten thouſand,
               reſting neither night nor dayes.
               Whereat the States Generall,
               did chooſe a Regiment:
               Of nimble Scotch and hardy Dutch,
               their comming to preuent.
            
            
               To Count Erneſtus of Naſſaw
               committed them in charge:
               About foure miles from Newport,
               to fortifie a Bridge.
               Who failed much therein, becauſe
               the Duke had paſt the ſame:
               Before Erneſtus Regiments,
               all ſoftly thether came.
            
            
               The Scotch-men were all cut off,
               and put to ſlaughter quite:
               But yet the Dutchmen hapned,
               to ſaue themſelues by flight.
               The which imboldned ſo the foe
               that he went forward ſtill:
               Without all daunger of aſſault,
               or fearing any ill.
            
            
               Vpon the foure and twenty day,
               they planted on a plaine:
               Eight great Canons ſoundly chargde
               a battle to maintaine.
               Whereat the Princely Generall,
               the ſiedge did ſoone forſake:
               And marcht to méete the Archduke,
               the better ground to take.
            
            
               Sir Frances Véere directed him,
               his ſquadrons to diſpoſe:
               How beſt for his aduantage,
               ſhould ſet vpon his foes.
               Nine Noble Engliſh Gentlemen,
               the firſt encounter gaue:
               With as much honour and renowne,
               as any Prince might haue.
            
            
               But yet before this battell ſtrong,
               betwixt them were begun:
               they ſtroue at leaſt ful two houres long
               for weather, winde and ſunne.
               At laſt Duke Alberts warlike drums
               did thunder in the ſkies:
               whereat Prince Maurice ſtird himſelf
               and thus couragious cryes.
            
            
               For Flaunders, and for England,
               braue gallants muſt we fight:
               In his defence and quarrell,
               that is the God of might.
               To armes I ſay then gallant lads,
               let nothing vs diſmay:
               Againſt profeſſed foes we fight,
               and hope to win the day.
            
            
               Which wordes did ſo imbolden,
               them of the common ſort▪
               
               That euery one eſteemde,
               the battle for a ſport.
               Where though they ſaw an hundred ſlaine
               by one great Cannon ſhot:
               Yet none of them in feare thereof,
               from thence would mooue a foote.
            
            
               Full foure long houres continued,
               this blacke and dreadfull fight:
               That both ſides well maintained,
               with courage and great might.
               The Cannons made ſuch lanes of men
               that ſoldiours wetſhood ſtood:
               As they diſcharg'd their Muſket ſhot,
               in pooles of purple blood.
            
            
               The ſunne with ſmoke was darkned,
               the element likewiſe:
               That like a diſmall cole blacke night,
               appeared all the ſkies.
               Like mountaines dead men lay on heapes
               moſt gréeuous to beholde:
               By numbers great and infinite,
               paſt reaſon to be tolde.
            
            
               At laſt the fearfull enemy,
               from field began to flye:
               Whereat our Engliſh Captaines,
               ſaint George ſaint George did cry,
               The battle's won, the day is ours,
               take courage by this chance:
               And in the honour of this day,
               our Engliſh Croſſe aduance.
            
            
               Then foure miles they purſued,
               the Spaniards in their flight:
               ſtill ſlaughtering them by thouſands,
               and ſo returnde by night.
               To Newport backe with warlike ioy
               the ſiedge for to renew:
               And driue the Spaniards from the towne
               with balles of fiery hew.
            
            
               In this ſame dreadfull battle,
               the Spaniſh Duke had ſlaine:
               Aboue fiue thouſand at the leaſt,
               moſt heauy newes for Spaine.
               One thouſand more they priſoners took
               withall three Spaniſh Lords:
               Which were by force compeld to yéeld
               them priſoners to our ſwordes.
            
            
               The Duke himſelfe as chaunced,
               was hurt with Muſket ſhot:
               And in ſuch ſort as hardly he,
               aliue to Bruſſels got.
               His Cannons they were taken all,
               his Treaſure and his Plate:
               Which be good priſes, and eſtéemde,
               well of the Flemiſh ſtate.
            
            
               A hundred fiftye Enſignes,
               were taken on that day,
               All which may be ſufficient
               the Spaniards to diſmay.
               And neuer more haue ſo bould harts,
               in warre to lift their handes:
               Againſt our noble Engliſh friendes,
               now in the Netherlandes.
            
            
               Of Engliſh, Scots and Dutchmen,
               we had ſome ſtore yſlaine,
               But few they were in number
               to them that fought for Spaine
               Few choſen captaines we had hurt,

               bore him from thence away
               A nobler deed then this was not
