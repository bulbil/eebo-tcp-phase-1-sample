            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            FAire Heauen of Graces, Hauen of content,
            The Worlds great Hope, and greater Ornament;
            Grace theſe my labours, with your heauenly eyes,
            In whoſe milde Hauen, my Hope at anchor lies;
            Where (may this ſhip with your ſafe-conduct ride)
            She will not feare a world of foes beſide:
            Say that ſome Rouer, who my lading ſpies,
            Shooting to make me his vnlawfull Prize,
            Call me a Pirate of anothers wit,
            That cannot make me ſtoope: Ile anſwere it.
            The Goods at firſt, they were bequeath'd to me,
            At my diſpoſe, to change the Propertie.
            So that I waſted not the Principall,
            For that be you my Iudge imperiall:
            VVhere, finde me guilty, puniſh not my will,
            But rather pitty mine vnured skill.
            Beſides (dread gracious Princeſſe) this I vow,
            By me they'd ne're been alter'd but for yow;
            Preſuming, natiue cloaths of Brittany,
            
            Would better pleaſe then ſilks of Italy;
            
            Say they'r not good, yet haue I done my beſt,
            To pleaſe your Grace, be pleas'd, and I am bleſt:

            TO THE HIGH AND Mighty Prince CHARLES Prince of Wales.
            
            
               THe deſired and happy marriage of that Illuſtrious Princeſſe, with that magnanimous and Heroical Prince, of ſo great blood (but of greater merits) hath bin generally celebrated among all the ſubiects with ſuch an vnaccuſtomed ioy, that ſome of them, being not able to containe themſelues, and yet deſirous to ſhew their deuoted affections, haue ſtrained their Muſe to ſing a ioyfull Hymen to their Highneſſes nuptiall rights: Among vvhich company, I being one of the number, although inferior to them all in euery thing (my loue and affection onely excepted) commaunded my Muſe, though in a hard and vnpleaſing ſtile, yet as well as ſhee could to expreſſe my vowed ſeruice and obedience to their Highneſſes. At the firſt I intended to haue made onely a ſhort and ordinary Epithalamium; but afterwards hauing conſidered better of it, I found it much fitter to diuide it into three bookes. The firſt Booke I ſent to the right Reuerend Father the

Lord Arch-biſhop of Yorke, who preſented it vnto the King. By this meanes I did thinke that if my firſt booke might haue a charitable cenſure of the wiſe and learned ſort of men, I might then, with leſſe feare and with more ſpirit, preſume to preſent this my booke, with the other two, vnto their Highneſſes. Notwithſtanding, I had no ſuch good conceit, either of myſelfe, or of my labours, to thinke them all three worthy to be expoſed to the iudgement, and cenſure of all men: and yet to haue put forth the one part, without the other, would haue made my Poeme imperfect, which had been a greater inconuenience. At length, ſome of my friends hauing receiued this Poeme printed it, being delighted with the noueltie of the matter, and deſirous to ſhew their affection and my congratulation to that happy marriage. At the firſt it grieued me a little, that my book, being not fully perfected, ſhould be printed: but at laſt hauing no deſire to haue it printed againe, after that the ſolemnities were ended, ſom of my friends began to importune me that I would impart my booke vnto them. I being eaſily ouercome with their vrging yeelded vnto their requeſts: This booke they haue now tranſlated into Engliſh, to the end that the Ladies may be partakers of this curious ſymetrie. This booke I offer vp vnto your Highneſſe of whom I haue heard many honorable relations at the right reuerend father in God my lord Arch-biſhop of Yorkes houſe; and now I do partly know your Highnes to be of ſuch a Princely diſpoſition, that you will not refuſe the protection of the firſt fruits of a Scholler, but rather cheriſh and maintaine them; eſpecially ſuch a one that proſtrateth

himſelfe and his labours at your Highneſſe feet, humbly beſeeching your Highneſſe not to ſuruey the booke with a curious eye, but to accept of that good minde which offers it. Laſt of all, I doe wiſh ſuch a Spouſe, as is deſcribed in theſe Hymnes, to be matched with your Highneſſe; and I beſeech thee, O God, to adde ſo much time to my yeeres, that I may liue to ſee it; to the end, that I may write a nuptiall Hymen of your Highneſſe marriage, in a more iudicious and acurate ſtile.
            
               Your Highneſſe moſt affectionate ſeruant,
Io. MARIA.
            
         
         
            
            The Argument, or Epitome, of the whole Poeme.
            
               IVpiter, by meanes of Mercury his meſſenger, ſummons a Conuocation of the Gods to confarre and diſpoſe of things here below; at this Synod, Religion (being a power amongſt the heauenly deities of no ſmall repute) made her appearāce, being ful of afflictiō, &amp; depriued of that accuſtomed coelestiall pompe, and diuine ornaments with which all th'other Gods then aſſembled in the Conſiſtorie of the higheſt heauens did moſt gloriouſly ſhine: which moued all the Gods to maruell, and father Iupiter himſelfe to require the cauſe of her griefe, whereof in her actions and habit ſhe gaue ſuch wofull remonſtrances. To whom ſhee anſwered with teares, and ſobbes, that this happened vnto her, becauſe ſhe was ſo torne and perſecuted in the world, by wickedneſſe and ſuperſtition, and other of Pluto's fire-brands, that ſhe had ſcarce any place there ſafely to reſt her ſelfe, farther intimating, what barbarous &amp; horrible torments ſhe and her followers had, for many ages paſt, ſuffered, and ſtill did indure. Which complaint of hers, moued the Deities to compaſsionate her, and cauſed them (being inkindled with a iuſt wrath againſt the infernall Furies) to begin to muſter vp, and bend their coeleſtiall forces to ſuccour her: But then the ruler of the Gods (hauing with his moſt maieſtick awfull becke calmed their indignation) most louingly comforted his afflicted Daughter; telling the deities that this was not to be remedied with fury and the deſtruction of men, but with fatherly and long ſufferance to bring home to his flock thoſe ſtrayed ſheep, by good counſell and exhortation, as in his eternall decrees hee had in this caſe determined; and that the chiefe meanes for the effecting hereof was, the linking together of two royal families in amost profitable marriage, long ſince preordained by Fate, for the reformation of theſe corrupted times: And then he repeated the auncient oracle of the goddeſs Themis, now vpon the point to be performed, in the perſons of the moſt illuſtrious Lady, the Princeſſe of great Brittany, and of the moſt noble Prince PALATINE, the vertues of which excellent couple, euen Ioue himſelfe collanded, and foretolde the many

bleſsings that ſhould proceed of theſe royall Nuptialls: whereby Religion, and the whole Quier of Heauen, were with great hopes appeaſed.
            
               THE II. BOOKE.
               THe Gods, with their recomforted Siſter, doe congratulate each other, and ſhe returnes them thankes for their ſo great fauors, and they allioine, and moue Iuno, the preſident of marriages, and Venus the mother of loue, to aſſume the Embaſſy &amp; the effectuating of this diſſeigne of the gods.
               
                  Iuno ſends downe vpon the earth Iris her Embaſſadreſs, clad with moſt artificiallueſtiments, in which the reforming of Religion, and the occurrences of greateſt conſequence in the world for many yeeres paſt were inwoo

                     atinate, where they entring ſecretly by night, Cupid with golden dart, &amp; amorous, fire in a dream, ſtrook &amp; inflamed the young Prince, not yet knowing the obiect of his deſire till afterwards walking in his gallery, entraunced with thoſe amorous thoughts, his eye lighted on the picture of the L. Elizabeth, the only daughter of the moſt puiſsant King of great Brittā, with whoſe portraiture, amōgſt diuers others of the greateſt Princeſses in the world, the ſaid gallery was beautified. At the firſt ſight of that faire picture, of a more faire ſubſtance; the Prince was ſuppriſed with a new flame, acknowledging that that was the beautifull forme which Cupid repreſented vnto him, and with which he ſtirred him vp to loue; and hereupon the Prince cauſeth the picture to be taken downe, and placed in his owne chamber, and to this ſhrius of his Goddeſs, he daily offers many truly inamorated and deuoted Oriſons: But his loue more &amp; more continually increaſing▪ his excellency could not be ſatisfied with this liueleſs reſemblance, but after many cō

               THE III. BOOKE.
               WHere being honorably receiued of the King, &amp; his whole Court, the Prince, with the excellency of his endowments of nature and art, &amp; by the inuiſible aſſiſtance of the ſupernall powers, in kindles no leſſe flames of loue, in the virgin breaſt of the royall Princeſſe towards him, then were in his Excellencies towards her highneſs: And whilſt each of theſe two, most louing, and moſt louely louers, did day &amp; night ſeuerally meditate of this their firſt loue; Conſus the lord of councel, in the ſhape of Philon, late his Maieſties tutor, appear'd in night to the ſleeping king, telling his highneſs, that the cōming of the Prince Elector into his kingdom, was by the ordinance of heauen; to the end, that by the aliance made between them, by the Princeſs his daughter, the ſtate of Religion ſhould he eſtabliſhed by this most wiſhed for mariage. To this heauenly Counſellor the king conſented, with this prouiſo, that the Prince ſhould firſt (as it was fitting) requeſt it at his highneſſe hands, which his excellency afterward willingly performing, his Maieſty, at the firſt motion, graciouſly condeſcended. The eſſpouſalls are prolaimed, and at the report hereof the whole kingdome reuels and keeps royall feſtiualls, and the father of waters Oceanus, hauing by Triton his Trumpeter aſſembled the Maritine &amp; fluuiall powers, doth out of the cleer brow of heauen, and the most temperate ſeaſon of the ſpring, prognosticate happy ſucceſſe, highly prayſing in this match the iudgement of the foreſeeing ſapient King, and therwithall prouokes euery thing to reioyce.
               Now comes the Bridall day, in honor whereof Vulcan, the God of fire, at the interceſſion of Venus his wife, doth with his element play his maſters prize, in preſenting ſtrange and delightful fire-workes vpon the Thames: And Mars in competition with him, to content the Queene of loue, ſhewes valiant and various feates and ſtratagems of warre; and the City, to ſhew her loue and legeance to her Soueraigne, with many ſorts of ſtately ſhowes diſembowelleth the inmoſt of her heart: and the king himſelfe, becauſe there ſhould be nothing wanting in this high ſolemnety, keepes an open Court full of all royall delights; In the middest whereof the marriage is conſummated, and the moſt louing royall paire obtaine the height of their amorous deſires.

                  T'approach the Pantheon of your glorious preſence,
                  And there behold your euer-bleſſed ſtates:
                  Then on your altars, crownd with myrtle-bowes,
                  Ile offer He catombs and incenſe vowes.
               
               
                  4.
                  
                     Ioue reſident in his Emperiall Towres,
                  Built on the pillars of Eternity
                  Calls for a Senate of coeleſtiall powres,
                  By which he gouernes with ſtability
                  Th'inſtable world, the waies of Sun and Moon,
                  And whatſoe're in Heauen or Earth is done.
               
               
                  5.
                  From hence the Pleiads, Nyads, fierce Orion,
                  
                  
                     Arctophilax, the great and leſſer Beares,
                  The Dolphin, Goat-fiſh, and fierce-hearted Lyon
                  Take the full influence of their flaming ſpheres:
                  From hence all heauenly conſtellations
                  Deriue their orders, influence, operations.
               
               
                  6.
                  Hence Nature takes her turnes, plants their increaſe,
                  Matter takes forme, Forme beauty, Beauty fall,
                  Number beginning, Motion worke and eaſe,
                  Place bodies, Bodies meaſure, Time takes all:
                  Hence Cauſe her cauſes hath, Fortune her courſe,
                  And Fates which neuer yield their mighty force.
               
               
                  7.
                  Hence came the generous kinds of euery beaſt,
                  And whatſoeuer ſwims in Seas quick tide,
                  And whatſoeuer lies on Earths rough breſt,
                  And whatſoeuer flies or far or vvide;
                  Man more then others hath attain'd Gods feature,
                  As being the chiefeſt, wiſeſt, holieſt creature.
               
               
                  8.
                  On him Ioue plac'd his deareſt loue and care,
                  His euerlaſting pleaſure and content,
                  Made him his creatures, graces, glories heire;
                  And made for him Seas, lands, aires large extent,
                  Keeping in forme and ſtrength he guides all right
                  For his defence, vſe, learning and delight▪
                  
               
               
                  
                  9.
                  Therefore when Hermes cal'd the ſtarry peeres,
                  As he was wont by mighty Ioues decree;
                  This holy Conclaue in full ſtate appeares
                  Cloath'd in nevv ſtately robes for their degree,
                  Paſſing the Firmaments bright Galaxie,
                  Striuing who ſhould exceed in Maieſtie.
               
               
                  10.
                  Firſt heauens great King takes his Imperiall ſtall,
                  His Queen and ſiſter, Iuno then hath place,
                  Grandame Cybele ſits next, fear'd of all;
                  Then Sol being paſt the Zones and Zodiak ſpace
                  Lights from his Coach, drawn by fowrfire-breath'd ſteeds
                  Puts off his beames, puts on his Councell weeds.
               
               
                  11.
                  Iuy-crown'd Bacchus from ſweet Hamus vines,
                  Yoking fierce Leopards arriues with glory,
                  
                     Caſtor and Pollux feather'd Laedas twins
                  Met (who meet ſeldome) in this conſiſtory:
                  Hither Alcides with his Lyons trame,
                  Came borne on froſty Boreas bright-beam'd waine.
               
               
                  12.
                  
                     Cynthia left hunting on Arcadia dovvnes
                  And wel-kept woods, to grace her golden ſphere;
                  Brain-bred Minerua laid aſide her frownes,
                  Although then arm'd with ſnakie Gorgons haire:
                  Rough Mars, growne milde, came clad in complete ſteele,
                  
                     Ceres forſook her ſith, Fortune her wheele.
               
               
                  13.
                  Hither came Venus, Beauties gracefull Queen,
                  Accompanied with Cupids dreadfull powre;
                  Neere her was Hebe, Iuno's daughter, ſeen
                  Adorn'd with ſcarlet robes, and Youths faire flowre;
                  
                     Chloris that crownes the ſpring, Maia the bright,
                  And ſhe that brings well-formed babes to light.
               
               
                  14.
                  
                     Aeole that pens in priſon the rude winde,
                  
                     Proteus which heer doth his firm ſhape retaine,
                  
                     Neptune with his ag'd Parents welny blind,
                  Faire Cimothe with all the ſea-gods traine;
                  The Nymphes of trees &amp; hils with neat-kemd haire,
                  Heere merry Pan, ſwift Fawnes, bold Satyrs are.
               
               
                  
                  15.
                  The Mountaine Pales and the Syluan God,
                  
                     Vulcan though lame, yet quick in fliut-found fire;
                  Siluer tong'd Hermes with his golden rodde,
                  The ſpirit of reſt and plenteous peace drew nigher:
                  Honor and Reuerence with humbled eyes,
                  And ſun-bright Maieſty which neuer dies.
               
               
                  16.
                  Still cheerfull Concord, Faith which neuer fain'd,
                  Well-meaning ſoone-entreated Honeſtie,
                  True Iuſtice, which by wrong-doing neuer gain'd,
                  With Phoebus Heliconian company
                  New-rich-attired: All tooke their ſeuerall places,
                  And gaue right oracles in doubtfull caſes.
               
               
                  17.
                  At laſt, (who ſhould be firſt in Parliament)
                  In came Religion, with ſad looke, ſoft pace,
                  Deepe ſighes, moyſt eyes, pale cheeks, haire and cloaths rent,
                  Submiſſiue geſture and deuoteſt grace:
                  Her followers were Sins-grief, Shames-feare, Worlds-pain,
                  She lean'd on Truth, wan Hope held vp her traine.
               
               
                  18.
                  Like Cynthia ſmother'd in a dropping cloud,
                  Or Sol when Phaeton Earths-face did burne,
                  In cole-black night his glorious beams did ſhrowd,
                  So did Religion look, ſo did ſhe mourne:
                  All-ſeeing Ioue beholding her vexation,
                  Scarſe held from teares in Fatherly compaſſion.
               
               
                  19.
                  Yet hiding his hearts griefe with pleaſing cheere,
                  Beſpeaks her ſad care, ſaying: Daughter what ailes thee?
                  Whence come the teares I ſee, the ſighs I heare?
                  How chance thy comelineſſe, thy colour failes thee?
                  Who durſt wrong thee or thine, the Giants it may be
                  (Sweet ſay the cauſe) haue riſen from earth to fray thee?
               
               
                  20.
                  She welny ſinking in a deadly ſwoune,
                  When ſorrowing ſobs would let her tell her mone,
                  Begins, yet weeps, lifts vp her eyes, looks downe,
                  Then ſaid. And is my cauſe as yet vnknown?
                  All wonder-working Ioue heare, help, relieue vs,
                  (Only thou canſt) and puniſh them that greiue vs.
               
               
                  
                  21.
                  It is not Grandame Earth, nor that huge brood,
                  Sprung of thy ſeed and hers, which wrought mine harms:
                  But worſe, far worſe: Dis, which did neuer good,
                  With craft and force his foul-mouthd legions armes,
                  And will not let me raigne or barely reſt me;
                  Orbide on earth, ſo much doth he deteſt ſhe.
               
               
                  22.
                  No ſooner can I driue him out my ſoyle,
                  But Hydra-like he comes with greater forces;
                  And growes more ſpightfull ragefull with his foyle,
                  More dangerous politick in diueliſh courſes:
                  So that, although my words renew my paine,
                  Yet is my griefe ſo great, I muſt complaine.
               
               
                  23.
                  At thy command you Gods that guide this round,
                  Attend with gentleneſſe my dolefull tale;
                  Myne aduerſary driuen from off the ground,
                  Where he had raingd by wrong, and wroughting bale,
                  Madded with pride and hate could not endure
                  Himſelf ſo baniſht, my throne ſo ſecure.
               
               
                  24.
                  But fuming, foaming, gnaſhing, breathing flame,
                  Hee teſtifies his rage with open iawes:
                  Hee chafes and ſnuffs, hee roares and howles for ſhame,
                  Hee beats his poyſned breſt with both his pawes,
                  He bites his lips, and rends his ougly locks,
                  His cries at heauen, his ghoſts at hel-gates knocks.
               
               
                  25.
                  His pride-ſwolne ſpleen, more fierce then his own fire,
                  Could not but bellow thus in vawtes of night;
                  Wa'ſt not enough that I which once was higher,
                  Then any creature both by birth and might,
                  Should firſt be caſt from heauen, then driuen to hell,
                  In euerlaſting darkeneſſe there to dwell.
               
               
                  26.
                  But that I ſhould be thruſt from out my chaire,
                  Purchaſt by warre and long in peace poſſeſt:
                  What title, reaſon, right can they declare?
                  Although for vprightnes they would be bleſt,
                  Their word's their law, their will's their equity.
                  
                     Dis wil not ſuffer this indignity.
               
               
                  
                  27.
                  While wit or ſword will ſerue I'le claime earths throne,
                  To moue mine anger thus it may repent them:
                  Being more they got the feild, the right's mine owne,
                  Where then war could not, wiſdome ſhall preuent them,
                  It neuer ſhalbe ſaid the Diuell aſſaild,
                  Gaue ore his cauſe, his hart or weapons faild.
               
               
                  28.
                  Let pitious Piety looke vnto her part,
                  Reuenge adds force, I'le make a ſecond venter;
                  My ſmart ſhall cauſe more then my ſelfe to ſmart,
                  The more ſhe driues me thence the more I'le enter,
                  Such is my will: Ioue keepe thy firmament,
                  Thou ſhalt not keepe in peace Earths regiment.
               
               
                  29.
                  This ſai'd he ſtai'd and calld the damned ſpirits,
                  The Goblins, Faeries, Furies, and their Dam,
                  
                  Exaggerates his falſe pretended rights,
                  Dilating his deare loſſe and far-ſpred ſhame,
                  Go forth, ſaid he, my braue Tartareons elues,
                  My ſhape, my pride, my gard, aduance your ſelues.
               
               
                  30.
                  Make iulſtre-entrance in your former ſtates,
                  Recouer your loſt honor, wreak your ſpites:
                  Regaine your ſubiects, open our wide gates,
                  Reſtore new altars for your auncient rites,
                  By ſtrength or cunning make my power ſome way,
                  Doe good or ill ſo that I win the day.
               
               
                  31.
                  My victorie ſhall iudge their cauſe the worſe,
                  Let Fate obey my words; Fortune my luſt:
                  Let me but conquer: Let heauen, earth, Ioue curſe,
                  Scarſe heard the furies this, but in they thruſt,
                  And light their Ebon torches in hot lime-ſtone,
                  Flaming ſalt peeter, all-conſuming brimſtone.

                  Adding the foame of Cerbrus triple iaw,
                  The moſt ilſauoring ſink of Lernafen,
                  
                  The venomus vomit of Chimera's maw:
                  Which burning bred annoy to Gods and men.
                  Muſtring their helliſh-ranks, an hundreth plagues,
                  A thouſand hel-hounds with ten thouſand hags.

                  So that all cried, arme, arme, none doubtfull ſtands,

                  To get them food while weake Hypocriſie,
                  
                  Sits watching all their tents with heedfull eye.
               
               
                  35.
                  Yet that ſucceſſe may ſort for their deſire,
                  They couer their ſore threats, keen ſwords, pale death,
                  And will vſe fraud before they ſhew their ire,
                  Changing the titles which they tooke beneath;
                  Framing falſe rights, hel-fire bred ſoldiors,
                  Would now bee knowne for heauen-bred Sauiors,
               
               
                  36.
                  For ſons of Ioue Earth tooke the ſlaues of hell,
                  
                     Babell was termd a Reuerend Sanctuary:
                  Idolatry Deuotion, high pride Zeale,
                  Raſh error a religious credulity.
                  Hipocriſie was cald lawes complement,
                  Thus euery vice got vertues ornament.
               
               
                  37.
                  The other furies got them other Veſtures,
                  The Cruell Wolues were clad with ſheeps faire clothing,
                  Looke lowly, ſeeming plaine, with curteous geſtures,
                  Outwardly praſing God, inwardly lothing.
                  Their ſpeach was pleaſant without murmuring,
                  Their harts all ragefull hate and ſlaughter breathing.
               
               
                  38.
                  They ſought the ruines of Nobles, kingdoms, kings,
                  If they deny them tribute, or contradict:
                  Or but refuſe obedience in bad things,
                  Or not ſubmit their crownes, they will afflict,
                  And curſe them downe vnto the deepeſt hell,
                  Falſe Menedemus was their Sentinell.
               
               
                  
                  39.
                  Aye me, th'Infernall Dragon did more harme,
                  By cloſe diſſemblance, then plaine cruelty:
                  And therefore did not hiſs, breath flames, or blacke troups arme,
                  But as old fiſhers catch the ſilly fry,
                  Couering their manly ſhape with goates rough skins,
                  So Dis by ſeeming faire, foule meaning wins.
               
               
                  40.
                  Aye me, ſo ſuttle was his craft and ſleight,
                  Not Pallas learn'd, not gold-tong'd Maias child:
                  Nor ſlie Vertumnus could vnfold it right,
                  Hee ment ſuch wrack, ſpoke ſo faire, lookt ſo mild,
                  Doing moſt vniuſtice yet hee ſeem'd moſt iuſt,
                  This got him greateſt honor, power and truſt.
               
               
                  41.
                  He ſeemes as not refuſing heauens firme lawes,
                  Neither thy new, nor auncient Oracles:
                  Thy fathers, nor they childrens old-ſaid ſawes,
                  And that which moſt confounds his practizes,
                  He takes as making moſt for his eſtate,
                  By this mens minds are moſt intoxicate.
               
               
                  42.
                  As cunning painters put their marble ſtayning,
                  On rotten cloth: He with contorted ſenſes
                  Turns and ore turns all truth, all rights deſtrayning,
                  And ſtraightning crooked things with his pretences,
                  Sends forth new ſects, new honors, golden ſhowers,
                  To them that guard his ſacrilegious Towers.
               
               
                  43.
                  Theſe vſe all meanes to lift the patron higher,
                  All ſupreme titles and ſubordinate
                  Are giuen him better then he can deſire,
                  Hence dares he what he liſt and thunders at
                  All earthly powers, as hauing thy power high Ioue,
                  
                  Takes and giues crownes as't pleaſe him hate or loue.
               
               
                  44.
                  He pardons and layes guilt on abſent men,
                  Hee claymes a ſoueraigne rule on fleſh-freed ſoules:
                  Fains a purge-fornace in his filthy den,
                  To couer his neuer-quenched brimſtone holes,
                  Greater preuent leſſe feares. Now men ſurmiſe,
                  His death life, hell arie, fire warmth, ſerpents flyes.
               
               
                  
                  45.
                  How oft haue ſinne and ſhame-bred ougly fiends
                  Spred errors far from thought, crimes from beliefe,
                  And ſowne profanenes in mens pregnant minds,
                  Which they no ſooner knew but put in priefe
                  Their leſſons; went beyond their teachers; taught
                  Others far worſe; at which Megara laught.
               
               
                  46.
                  How oft his pild Prieſt offering, raſh-vow'd gifts,
                  Applauds his owne conceit, when like a player,
                  He croſſeth, kiſſeth, ſtands, goes, turns and ſhifts,
                  Mocking our powers with timeles ſenſeleſs prayer,
                  As if our honor were tied vnto the ſtage,
                  And we were naught, but what pleas'd this late age.
               
               
                  47.
                  Oh gods! can men ſo ſoon forget good rites?
                  Is this their faith and loue, their holy zeale?
                  Are Temples thus vnhallowed with lewd ſights?
                  Thinke they to pleaſe, when in ſuch wiſe they deale?
                  Worſhipping blocks for vs, they thinke vs blocks,
                  And bowing to ſtones, they make themſelues but ſtocks.
               
               
                  48.
                  They keep, and creep, and weep to guilded lead
                  Or wooden ſticks, or dead-mens cloths or bones,
                  All that vs worſhipt, muſt be worſhipped
                  Themſelues, their carcaſes, their buriall ſtones
                  Tendring to death, who neither can heare, nor ſee,
                  Thoſe prayers that ſhould be made only to thee.
               
               
                  49.
                  How oft when any doth reſiſt their will
                  Swelling they ſnarle, and ſend forth dangerous wars?
                  Such was theſe Monſters boldned loue of euill,
                  That mingling vitre, pitch, brimſtone, ſteel-bars
                  (The matter bred neere, the skill brought from hel)
                  Would faine haue drawne, and driu'n vs thither pel-mel.
               
               
                  50.
                  Digging the bowels of the wondring earth,
                  And laying their diuel-found engines in her veines,
                  They would haue opened wider gates to death,
                  To paſſe in ſhorter time with ſorer paines:
                  Their chiefeſt mark was my wiſht ouerthrow,
                  With all my better worlds by one fierce blow.
               
               
                  
                  51.
                  Oh miſchiefe worſe then any ſpoke in fables,
                  Exceeding Danaus bride-beds, and Buſiris,
                  
                  Or Euxin Dians altars, Tantalus tables;
                  
                     Pluto now cannot worſe, whoſe fell deſire is
                  To root out all my ſtock, vnleſs he kild,
                  My choice Defender with heauens fauors fild.
               
               
                  52.
                  For his deſtruction, who from infancie,
                  Becauſe a nouriſhing Father to my ſeed
                  They would haue ſlaine his Queene, Lords, Commonalty:
                  For one all ſhould haue periſht (oh fowle deed!)
                  To driue all true deuotion out my land,
                  They would not let Towres, Temples, Cities ſtand,
               
               
                  53.
                  Then might the world haue known the deeps of Stix,
                  Theſe miſchiefe-broachers might haue ſeen their place.
                  Who (could they with one blow, heauen, earth, hell, mixe
                  With all their force) would all my rites deface:
                  Iuſtice, with ſhame-faſtneſſe and modeſty,
                  Fled Earth and would not ſee this cruelty.
               
               
                  54.
                  Poore I, ſo much and oft amaz'd with griefe,
                  So ſore purſued with inquiſitions,
                  Scap't ſcarſe their hands and tooke me to reliefe,
                  They rais'd ſo many perſecutions;
                  Only the care of mine me fortified,
                  For whoſe deare ſake I would (if't might be) died.
               
               
                  55.
                  Why ſhould I reckon all thoſe grieuous croſſes
                  Thy children vndergoe: let heauens beare record,
                  No light or night can paſſe without ſome loſſes,
                  The night for dreams, the light for pains abhord:
                  Theſe proue thoſe true, ſo no where peace I finde,
                  Feare pain, pain breeds more feare in my mar'd mind.
               
               
                  56.
                  Thus I that once brought forth ſo many people,
                  To multiply thine heauenly family,
                  Now dry, weake, old, can hardly get a ſteeple
                  But muſt lament their ruines and miſery:
                  I that ſpred once my light as vvide as day,
                  To th'Prince of darknes am now made a prey.
               
               
                  
                  57.
                  I which once rais'd my trophees in each land,
                  Made holeſome lavves, rul'd Nations with my rod;
                  Behold a vvretched fugitiue heer ſtand
                  Deſpiſed: and canſt thou ſuffer this great God?
                  Is this my povver, my kingdme promiſed?
                  Is thy poore daughters dovvry thus demiſed?
               
               
                  58.
                  Shall I thus vvander hauing no certaine cell,
                  When other Gods can haue their thouſand ſhrines
                  Of golde, high-built, and free from dangers fell,
                  While thy lou'd off-ſpring vvithout lodging pines:
                  Yet vvould I not my brethren ſhould haue leſſe,
                  Proud enuy fits not my forlorne diſtreſſe.
               
               
                  59.
                  Onely let my poore deity complaine,
                  (If thus I may be call'd, not being hence baniſht)
                  That the cold Sauromate and Scythian,
                  Who vvander vp and dovvne, leaſt they be famiſht,
                  Driuing their vvhole-built coates from place to place
                  Are, being more ſure of ſeat, in better caſe.
               
               
                  60.
                  A vvretched mother, gods and men may call me,
                  Still muſt my ſons be fighting for their ovvne;
                  In euery place and time ſtrife doth befall me,
                  For pains long paſt I vvill not novv make mone:
                  My preſent feares expecting yet far more,
                  Make me forget vvhat I endur'd before.
               
               
                  61.
                  This plague's not all extinct: hels malice boiles,
                  His miſchief-plotting brain deuiſeth vvorſe,
                  Our holy vvrits he burns, and Saints he broiles,
                  Deſtroies vvhole countries vvith a blaſting curſe;
                  Appoints nevv lavves, and ſets nevv gods on hie,
                  All that gain-ſay by force or fire ſhall die.
               
               
                  62.
                  He ſtill prepares more and more puniſhments,
                  For ſuch as vvel profeſſe my truths pure faith,
                  I ſee the maſſacres and baniſhments,
                  Priſons and poiſons vvhich in ſtore Dis hath,
                  Vnleſſe you quell their pride (bleſt povvres diuine)
                  We cannot ſcape: helpe then my ſelfe and mine.
               
               
                  
                  63.
                  If any piety or pittie moue you,
                  (All Gods, in wiſdome, ſhould each care for other)
                  Forſake not my faint hopes and them that loue you,
                  You which defend all creatures, do not loth her
                  Which is your friend &amp; ſiſter, though much grieu'd;
                  See my true harmeleſs children ſoon relieu'd.
               
               
                  64.
                  Father, if I haue euer prais'd thy power,
                  And ſpred thy mighty name through Earths vaſt ground;
                  Deliuer me and mine from this ſad howre,
                  By thy right hand with which thou rul'ſt this round,
                  Thy God-head, and my ſafe-gard Ile inuoke thee,
                  If neither thy care, nor my laments prouoke thee,
               
               
                  65.
                  Yet pitty thine owne glory, thine owne brood:
                  For if I periſh, or my face muſt hide,
                  Thy fame and ſubiects, which thou boughtſt with blood,
                  Will faile from thee vvhich thou ſhouldſt not abide:
                  If yet thou vvilt not helpe yet grant this boon,
                  I may preuent all griefs by dying ſoon.
               
               
                  66.
                  Thus did Religion ſpeak, and ſtaid her ſpeech,
                  Winding her armes and caſting downe her eyes,
                  As if ſhe death did rather then life beſeech,
                  But as when harueſt-winds ruſh from the skies,
                  The leaues in vvoods a ruſtling murmur make,
                  Such a ſoft vvhiſpring did the Gods ore-take.
               
               
                  67.
                  This Goddeſſe being ſo neere a kin, ſo grieuing,
                  Mov'd much compaſſion in their tender ſpirits;
                  They thought high Ioue too milde in gouerning,
                  Themſelues too calme to Dis for his demerits:
                  They meane to comfort her with heauenly force,
                  And ſtop the Furies in their bloody courſe.
               
               
                  68.
                  So much were all incens'd vvith her true teares,
                  When all-ore-ſwaying Ioue commands them ſilence,
                  Shakes Heauen and earth with ſhaking his gold-haires,
                  And then ſpeaks thus with dreadfull excellence:
                  Daughter, my praiſe and greateſt power below,
                  Free thy faire cheeks from teares, thy thought from woe.
               
               
                  
                  69.
                  We nere did yet, nor euer will for-goe thee,
                  Thy loue ſo deeply ſettles in our breſt:
                  Our care and prouidence nere ſhall be fro thee,
                  Heauen is thy friend: My ſelfe with all the reſt,
                  And if thou wouldſt the fates and me conceiue,
                  What we determine, I'le declare, giue leaue.
               
               
                  70.
                  Hearing the boyſterous threats of Dis foule iawes,
                  And ſeeing him looſe his furies from ſtix flood:
                  T'infect th'erroneous world, they might break lawes
                  Of Gods and men, confounding what is good,
                  Perceiuing darknes ouer-ſpread this age,
                  And man-kind much degenerate from our image.
               
               
                  71.
                  The primitiue pureneſſe all corrupt with luſt,
                  The truth ore weighd with fond inuentions:
                  Vice boaſting ouer Vertue laid in duſt,
                  The Dragon conquering by diſſentions.
                  We ſaw (which mou'd vs moſt) our children dying,
                  And heard their guiltles blood for vengeance crying.
               
               
                  72.
                  Often my wrath did burne to thunder-ſtrike them,
                  But that the beautious order of all creatures
                  Made me repent: for though I did not like them,
                  Yet for them would I not diſſolue all Natures.
                  I knew their houre of horror was not come,
                  Wherein they ſhould receiue their damning doom.
               
               
                  73.
                  To be ſtill bound in chaines of diſmall night,
                  Eternally to ſuffer griefe and death;
                  Meane while how ere they deale by craft of ſpite,
                  He workes himſelf more paine and ſhame beneath,
                  More glory to the Gods: No maruaile then,
                  If they corrupt the liues and harts of men.
               
               
                  74.
                  So ſoone ſo fin. He formerly poſſeſt them,
                  Tempting but once he made them throughly euill▪
                  
                  Since when iniquity ſo much oppreſt them,
                  Their Vertue eas'ly yeelds vnto the Diuell,
                  The Crime of their firſt fathers concupiſence▪
                  
                  Polluted all his childrens conſcience▪
                  
               
               
                  
                  75.
                  I ſee and ſuffer this: for to ſtrike all,
                  Would void my treaſure-houſe of thunder-bolts,
                  Beſides the vulgar oft in errors fall;
                  Calling euill good, good euill, and ſo like dolts,
                  Thinking to merit, deſerue their owne damnation,
                  Hoping to ſave themſelues, looſe their ſaluation.
               
               
                  76.
                  I grieue indeed, and faine would helpe with ſignes
                  The faith of men, but that my words are plain:
                  Though they remember not my ſacred lines;
                  Pittying I put them to no further pain.
                  For thus hath heauen decreed from this high chaire,
                  Faith is not forced, free-will admits no feare.
               
               
                  77.
                  It is our grace that enters mens ſoft mindes,
                  And there informes, reformes, conforms their will:
                  It neither draws or driues, but as it findes;
                  It ſhews here heauen, there hel, here good, there euill.
                  What ſo ere men doe, being dead, they ſhall ſuſtain,
                  The more they know ſo rer ſhall bee their pain.
               
               
                  78.
                  When heauen and earth ſhall paſſe with horrid crie,
                  And all abuſed creatures plague their ſin:
                  Yet I, that made all, would haue nothing die,
                  Leaſt mine and their foule aduerſarie grin.
                  And therefore counſel rather vſe then ſtrength,
                  That men knowing me might come to heauen at length.
               
               
                  79.
                  And with ſuch order will I guide ſucceſſe,
                  Vertue ſhall nere ſo faile, nor ſin ſo grow,
                  That euery furie ſhall their wiſh poſſeſſe,
                  As when they made all fit for that fowle blow;
                  I ſuffered them to chooſe, deuiſe, prepare,
                  Men, matter, place, yet all defeated were.
               
               
                  80.
                  They could not bring to paſſe their policies,
                  The good were garded by mine hand and eie:
                  For I diſcloſing their deepe villanies,
                  Brought them to death, which would haue others die.
                  Who keeps his hart from guile, his hands from crime,
                  May now ſecurely paſſe his peacefull time.
               
               
                  
                  81.
                  And if ſome-times the tempeſt of miſchaunce,
                  Hinder his eaſe, heauen will thus breed his crowne:
                  So (daughter whom I ſtudy to aduance)
                  Full oft thou findſt my help being oft caſt downe,
                  Nor could thy weakeneſſe haue endur'd ſo long,
                  Vnles my might had made thy faith more ſtrong.
               
               
                  82.
                  Remember I did oft thine honor nouriſh,
                  When men againſt thee threatned ſword and fire,
                  I made thy Children more and better flouriſh,
                  Whom neither force could feare, nor meed could hire,
                  Hell ſtriues in vaine againſt thy power deuine,
                  Thy kindgom ſhall remaine as long as mine.
               
               
                  83.
                  What thou giu'ſt other Gods, men ſhall giue thee,
                  Thou ſhalt haue ſinceere worſhip, ſacred orders,
                  (Doubt not, chere vp thine hart, hope, truſt on mee)
                  With comely temples and enlarged borders,
                  Thou ſhallt be Queene on earth, and Queen in heauen.
                  
                     Iudgement ſhall right thy wrongs and make all euen.
               
               
                  84.
                  Though much is not now giuen, or ſeat ſecured,
                  Yet ſhall my Loue augment thy precious name;
                  In minds and mouths of men, be ſtill aſſured,
                  Behold thy primitiue pureneſſe, free from blame
                  Return'd reſtores true ioy: See Babel cries,
                  Becauſe the ruling Dragon thence faſt flies.
               
               
                  85.
                  His Creſt is laid, fire quenched and ſting rebated,
                  Deare loue, ſweet peace, ſound faith, and vertue ſprings;
                  The furies and their terrors are amated:
                  Now Time his daughter Truth from darknes brings,
                  Remember but the Calydonian mayd,
                  Thy feare, care, griefe, paine, ſhalbe ſoone allayd.
               
               
                  86.
                  Her name and manners great Eliza left her,
                  Her knowledge came when ſhe became thy daughter,
                  Such grace I gaue as neere ſhalbe bereft her,
                  So much I lou'd the former, that the later
                  Shallbe more bleſt, and bleſſe thee with more peace,
                  Making thine hopes and honor ſtill encreaſe.
               
               
                  
                  87.
                  The fates agreed with me we ſhould appoint her,
                  To be created of two Princely lines,
                  Before ſhe came to light I did annoint her
                  With ſuch a name and fame as euer ſhines:
                  No ſooner had her bleſſed mother conceiu'd her,
                  But into ſpeciall fauour I receiu'd her.
               
               
                  88.
                  I planted Vertues ſeed with gifts of grace,
                  Such as were neereſt mine originall image;
                  
                     Loue gaue rare beauty ſhining in her face,
                  And comely parts that would augment with age:
                  Being borne, Ambroſia fed, while Venus waſht her
                  With dews, which Dian dried, my beams refreſht her.
               
               
                  89
                  
                     Euphroſine left Cyprus to giue Nectar
                  
                  Nurſe-like (at my commaund) this Babe to keep,
                  
                     Nais (Caleſto frowning) did affect her
                  And daunc'd about her cradle to bring ſleepe;
                  While Philomela ſung, Nape brought flowers,
                  And ſtrewd them on in parti-coloured ſhowres.
               
               
                  90.
                  Soft Erithrea put garlands on her head,
                  Faire Phione brought pearl-full cockle-ſhels,
                  
                     Calipſo came with many an amber bead,
                  The Nymphs plaid muſick with ſweet ſiluer bels:
                  All wundred at, kiſt, honord, bleſſed, embraced
                  This pretty child: ſhe them with ſmiling graced.
               
               
                  91.
                  Her countenance was cheerly amiable,
                  Bearing ſure markes of a more gracefull ſpirit;
                  Her eyes were comely, louely, admirable:
                  No ſooner did her feet the ground inherit,
                  But ſhe trod vnder pride and ignorance,
                  And did her ſelfe to better things aduance.
               
               
                  92.
                  How often did ſhe clip her Parents neck
                  To witnes her deare loue, which they perceiuing,
                  A thouſand kiſſes giue, a thouſand take,
                  Ofher ſoft roſie lips fit words conceiuing:
                  Such was her face both Parents might be knowne,
                  So gently, yet ſo royally it ſhone.
               
               
                  
                  93.
                  Her cheere was pleaſing yet with maieſtie,
                  Which drew the Graces neerer to direct
                  How ſhe might ſpeake and moue her pretty bodie,
                  With graue decorum yet vvith milde aſpect;
                  To temper all her thoughts, lookes, geſtures, motions,
                  With honeſt ſeemlineſſe, holy deuotions.
               
               
                  94.
                  Her ſmooth-large forehead kept faire ſhamefaſtnes,
                  Her tongue was guided with ſweet eloquence,
                  Laughter ſat ſmiling in her cheeks with gladneſſe,
                  Eyes, lids, eares, heares, each had their excellence:
                  To dreſſe her ſelfe ſhe tooke light care, ſhort leaſure,
                  
                     Grace, like a die, caſt any way gaue pleaſure.
               
               
                  95.
                  Her goings were guided with a modeſt meaſure
                  Of all her mouing parts: yet oft ſhe ſat
                  And red her duties in my ſacred Scripture,
                  Or heard while her bleſt mother wiſdome taught:
                  Her wiſdome oft abſtain'd from childiſh toyes,
                  Vertue to learne and thinke on heauenly ioyes.
               
               
                  96.
                  Such was Elizabeth in tender age,
                  Going beyond her yeeres in Wiſdomes lore,
                  Her Parents hope in grace, her ſex in courage;
                  Thus did I cheriſh till I gaue her ouer
                  To learne ſound manners vnder thy tuition,
                  Pure Virgin thoughts with Princely diſpoſition.
               
               
                  97.
                  Thou maiſt record how ſoon ſhe did conceiue thee,
                  And practice rules of thy perfection,
                  Mine hopes are great of her, which nere deceiue thee
                  For late inflamed with deepe affection,
                  In clouds I paſt her friendly fathers court,
                  To looke and vvonder at her ſtately port.
               
               
                  98.
                  I fixt mine eyes, mine eyes, my thoughts not filld
                  With ſeeing: the more I ſee, the more I gazed
                  How ſweet her youth, how Pallas like her ſmile,

                  Beholding beauties all agree to grace her,

                  And marriage-making louely modeſty,
                  Sutors throng thither, Nobles did aſpire,
                  And Kings of boundleſs kingdomes her deſire.

                  Dukes rich in treaſures, titles, aunceſtrie,

                  Her ſweetnes taught them hope, feare maieſty,
                  Not knowing to whom wee'l grant her good fortune:
                  Yet neither mighty Kings, nor famous Princes,
                  Whom power or pleaſure cal'd, were thought fit matches

                  Such mariages our Councell here diſpoſeth
                  According to the fore-fight of their fates:
                  It was not fleſh and bloud, but heauens high breath
                  Ordain'd a bed-mate for Elizabeth.

                  For I remember it was once my pleaſure,
                  To ſearch the depth of all antiquity
                  Concerning this: when Themis from her treaſure
                  Of true praeſages, ſpoke this verity;
                  For ſince this feare affrights thy thoughts, Ile tell

                  When I firſt mou'd his child-eater from hence,

                  Flouriſh for euer in glorious excellence,
                  He being exil'd could hither no miſchiefe bring;
                  Yet what he could he did,, and lurk below,
                  In hate of vs deuiſing mens deep woe.

                  With cunning malice, enuious pride, and rage;
                  Yoking the Fox, Woolfe, Lyon, Viper, Dragon,
                  He whips them round about the worlds wide ſtage:
                  They more by this incens'd, with poyſnous breath,

                  Not ſatiate with corruption of all natures,
                  He would haue ouer-turn'd Earths axle-tree,
                  And ouer-whelm'd it headlong in the waters,
                  His right hand ſhov'd and mov'd it horribly:
                  Which we ſoon feeling from our heauenly Tower,
                  Our ſauing arme ſtayd his deſtroying power.

                  And forc'd our ſelfe condemned for to fly,
                  And chain'd him vp in deeps of horrid night;
                  For though he ſpoild not all, he had wel-ny
                  So tainted all, that nothing ſtood vpright:
                  Shook order out of ioint into confuſion,
                  Driuing place and time to diſſolution.

                  Mens bodies were (the cauſe vnknowne) tormented:
                  The ſpring began to fade from plants and flovvers,
                  Eaſt, Weſt, North, South, did rage on Thetis bovvers.

                  At firſt there needed neither plow nor harrow,
                  Cattell were free from drawing, men from driuing:

                  Then men moſt lou'd of vs began to perriſh,
                  Their natiue health and ſtrength grew leſſe and leſſe:

                  Their invvard, more then outvvard, man did ſicken,
                  So that not Zeuxis art, nor Midas crovvne:
                  Nor Muſicks harmonie their ſpirits could quicken,
                  Nor ſtately palaces, nor beds of dovvne,

                  116.
                  And did enquire of Themis, if mans fall

                  Such is thy royall power and excellence,

                  The Palatines did not firſt raiſe that flood,

                  And change her countenance from heauy cheare
                  Then ſhe with ſmooth-fac'd maieſty replied,

                  You that make new from old and good from ſinne,
                  From out my ſorrowes haue now brought forth gladnes:
                  It lies not in my worth your grace to win,
                  To think to recompence with wordes were madnes:

                     Cupid, great Captaine of this amorous hoſt
                  With golden Darts which bred equall deſire:
                  Was leading them from Ioues courts vtmoſt coaſt,
                  To whom faire Iris with her troops drew nigher:
                  With beauty borrowd from the ſuns reflection,
                  And all fit coulours for to mooue affection.
               
               
                  16.
                  Her cloathing vvas not precious pearles nor gold,
                  Nor vvol, nor ſilke, nor any mixt of all:
                  But both exceeding vvondrous to behold,

                  Her ſkill and art had curiouſly diſtinguiſht,

                  Three of the former hornes did ſoone diſgrace,
                  And therefore ſpoke preſumptuous blaſphemies,
                  Not far from thence it ſhevved a vvomans face,

                  Yet ſhe calls neighbor Kings to deeper draughts,

                  With pollicies attracting many a nation,

                  Can true religion be ſo bold and blind:
                  To thinke that in vaine Idols Gods do lurke?
                  Or that the Carpenter hath Ioue aſſignd;
                  To dwell in trees, the potter in his work?
                  Or caruer wiſer then Pigmalion,

                  Will high-bred ſoules their bodies bow to clay?
                  No. God is greater then we can beleeue him,
                  No ſtocke or▪ſtone or body can receiue him.

                  Giuing indulgence for each hainous deed,
                  More then God would or Satan durſt, he dares;
                  All men were mute, but Luther could not quiet

                  To ſee whether Gods or men this griefe wil cure.

                  Religion made this hungry monſters prey,
                  Made him to pitty men ſo much oppreſt,
                  So that he ſeems to think what he would ſay,
                  To curb her madnes and reforme the reſt:
                  Yet humane weaknes ouertakes his mind,

                  It may be thus he thought; how raſh am I,

                  Thus being incenſed with diuineſt heat,
                  Which could not ſee and ſuffer ſuch prophaneſſe:

                  She mad, with griefe and ſhame, writhes her fowle traine
                  Hither and thither to get liberty,
                  And with fell poiſon doth her place diſtaine,
                  And ſliding thence at length, not furiouſly;
                  As heretofore in threats or arms doth riſe,
                  But miſchiefe plots and treaſons doth deuiſe.

                  Or on Cayſters flood, or through the ſkie,
                  The milk white Swans, paſſe on in louely ranckes,
                  Such beuteous order had this company,
                  But ſweeter muſick while they wau'd the wing,

                  Then part they quires, and with redoubling voyce,

                  As violets excell the bramble briar,
                  Lilly the violets that the roſe diſgraceth:
                  
                     Eliza ſo doth Virgins: As Stars fire,

                  61.
                  Now Laedas twinnes deſcend from their high throne,
                  To viſit land and Seas with doubled rayes,
                  Cheering the plough-ſwaines and the marriners mone,

                  Such is their faith and loue, ſuch are their beauties,

                  Thus had theſe glorious Nuncios paſt the ſpheres,
                  Fit manſions for the free or fixed lights,
                  Whence this world (whom we count ſo vaſt) appeares
                  As here a barly-corne in their cleere ſights:
                  Yet comming neerer they diſcerne the Mountains,
                  The Champain, vales, woods, rocks, ſeas, floods and fountains.
               
               
                  64.
                  They ſeeing men ſhew like Ants, kingdoms like fields,
                  Cities like Cells: more neerely ſhape their courſe
                  Towards the land which Tuiſco's god-head ſhields,
                  At firſt with manly, now with heauenly force:
                  There they ſaw Rhene receiue Neccars cleere flood,
                  On whoſe high banks the Palſe-graues palace ſtood.
               
               
                  65.
                  Which once was but an homely ſhepheards coate,
                  Till Conrade built it in ſo gorgeous frame,
                  It may compare with Cities of great note,
                  For people, buildings, orders, traffick, fame:
                  Hither they take their flight, and ſilently
                  They paſſe the confines of this territorie.
               
               
                  66.
                  Then entring this braue Court, not better grounded,
                  Then kept with Iouiall hoſpitalitie,
                  With one conſenting voice, which neuer ſounded
                  In mortall eares, that place they ſanctifie,
                  Saying: oh deare gods that keep &amp; guide theſe rooms,
                  Bleſt be your powers, bles your Prince, nobles, grooms.
               
               
                  67.
                  Oh manſion which with Babell maiſt compare,
                  In that thy walls contain'd an honoured Youth;
                  That in his power and courage can and dare
                  Relieue the oppreſſed world, reſtore the truth:
                  
                     The Palatine with Britaine ioin'd ſhall bring

                  68.
                  Now Phoebus red with heat and burning haſte
                  Had left our world, and drencht his fiery throne
                  In Heſperus warme waues, now had he paſt
                  With his bright beams to th' Antipods vnknowne:
                  And there vnbridling his flame-breathing ſteeds,
                  From toyle, with Nectar and Ambroſia feeds.
               
               
                  
                  69.
                  Now night with duskie chariot paſt the skies,
                  Fild heauen with twinkling ſtars, earth with dark ſilence,
                  Fann'd ſleep on mortall creatures wearied eyes,
                  That ſtaid all buſineſſe, buried each offence:
                  The Palatine forgets his Princely cares,
                  With gratefull eaſe which crept on him vnwares.
               
               
                  70.
                  His Nobles had giuen ouer themſelues to reſt,
                  Nought could be ſeene and heard in all the Citie▪
                  
                  Then Cupid, ſeeing his time, (as he knew beſt)
                  Began his ancient art and charming dittie;
                  With poppie-ſeed he doth all ſenſes dimme,
                  That maz'd with ſleep they might not hinder him.
               
               
                  71.
                  He ſetting then his fellowes each in place,
                  Where they might ſooneſt further his deſigne,
                  With lanterne wiſely clos'd, and ſtealing pace,
                  Viſits the chamber of the Palatine:
                  
                  
                     Carna the Goddeſſe which of doores takes charge
                  Vnlooſing hindge, and lock, makes entrance large.
               
               
                  72.
                  And that ſo ſoftly, that no mortall heares;
                  The God of loue ſeeing this, goes till he came
                  Where Frederick tooke his reſt, void of all feares,
                  And then diſcloſeth his before-hid flame:
                  He might behold his Princely limms and face,
                  Which euen in ſleeping could not looſe their grace.
               
               
                  73.
                  Beholding, he much wonders at his faireneſſe,
                  In euery part ſo well proportioned,
                  With ſuch maieſtick forme, ſuch pleaſing rareneſſe,
                  As few by nature are like faſhioned:
                  Then enuy taints his heart, as if high Ioue
                  
                  Had in his frame ſhew'd greater art and loue.
               
               
                  74.
                  For if in ſleep he ſuch affections moue,
                  His fore-head, ey-browes, cheeks, lips are ſo pleaſing
                  How will he waking, ſpeaking, looking proue?
                  How comely ſhall his body proue with dreſſing?
                  Oh worthy, bleſſed Youth, doe not grow proud
                  Of that which liberall nature hath allow'd.
               
               
                  
                  75.
                  Fortune hath giuen thy perſon good ſucceſſe,
                  Fate orders all things for thy further good,
                  All heauen conſults how it thy State may bleſſe,
                  And match thee fitly both for worth and bloud;
                  This ſaid: with a loue-cauſing golden dart,
                  He ſoftly bares and aymes at his deare heart.
               
               
                  76.
                  Yet ayming he beheld ſo ſweet a breſt,
                  He ſmooths and ſtroakes, but could not wound, or ſtrike;
                  My darts (he ſaid) are dangerous, let them reſt
                  They Phoebus pierce, or thoſe I doe not like:
                  Thy feature ſo neere mine moues my remorſe,
                  Thy tender ſoule needs no ſuch violent force.
               
               
                  77.
                  I vvill not vſe my wonted arts to thee,
                  So laying aſide his arrow-breeding-ſmart,
                  He noints his breſt with iuice of mirtle tree;
                  And laying his mouth to mouth, and heart to heart,
                  Embracing his firme body with both his armes,
                  And with diuine heate his pure entrailes warmes.
               
               
                  78.
                  Then with ſweet kiſſing takes and giues him breath,
                  And in that breathing doth infuſe deſire;
                  Applies his torch the Princes lips beneath,
                  Who panting for coole aire, drew loues quick fire:
                  Which being breath-carried, ſwifter then an arrow,
                  Had quickly pierc'd his hart, head, ſpirits and marrow.
               
               
                  79.
                  Which the Prince feeling ſigh'd, and ſighing waked,
                  Sleep vaniſht from his eyes, and with him Cupid:
                  
                  Yet ſo that his infection nothing flaked,
                  And made him with admiring welny ſtupid:
                  That he ſhould ſweat and burne (the cauſe vnknown)
                  His mind was mazed, himſelfe was not his owne.
               
               
                  80.
                  Not otherwiſe then if one thunder-ſtrooke,
                  Liues yet vncertaine whether he liue or no,
                  Tries whether he ſleepe or wake: So did he look,
                  Whether they were dreams or truth, which vext him ſo:
                  Yet while he looks, his heart ſhut vp the paſſion,
                  Which being inclos'd works deeper inflammation.
               
               
                  
                  81.
                  He, though but little vnderſtanding loue,
                  Yet vnderſtands his thoughts are deeply chang'd,
                  Not knowing it end, he knowes it ſo far moue
                  As that himſelfe is from himſelfe eſtrang'd:
                  Firſt he loues not, yet would loue inſtantly,
                  Then loues, yet ſees not either whom, or why.
               
               
                  82.
                  He thinks how ſweet a thing it were to marry
                  An equall bed-mate: dreams would not ſo feare him,
                  Nor cares ariſe by lying ſo ſolitary;
                  Or if they did a Comforter were neere him:
                  On th'other ſide his vnexperienc'd age,
                  And much-lov'd libertie ſuch thoughts aſſwage.

                  The tender ſimpleneſſe of honeſty,
                  The bitter croſſe of an vnequall yoke,
                  An in-bred ſhamefaſtneſſe and chaſtitie,
                  With awfull reuerence of his Parents, choke
                  His former youthfull thoughts, yet loue commands,
                  And who the force of conquering loue with-ſtands.
               
               
                  As Rhine encreas'd with brooks, more toſſeth
                  A laden ſhip, the more men ſhall reſiſt;
                  So loues fire fiercer grows, when reaſon croſſeth:
                  Now Phoebus beams had baniſht nights darke miſt,
                  
                     Aurora cheer'd and cleer'd all mortall eyes:
                  The Count leaues bed, yet could but weakely riſe,
               
               
                  85.
                  For knowing no cauſe of this vncertaine fit,
                  The leſſe he knowes, the more he ſtands aſtound;
                  As a fierce horſe refuſing the firſt bit,
                  Snores, fomes, and ſtamps, as if he skorn'd the ground:
                  His hoofe ſtrikes vp, his noſtrils breath out fire,
                  So Frederick would, but could not leaue deſire.
               
               
                  86.
                  His paſſion euery day doth more encreaſe,
                  The more it wanteth ſatisfaction;
                  No ſtudie, ſport, or time can it appeaſe,
                  So ſmall his comfort, ſuch was his diſtraction:
                  His cheeks grew pale, his lims did throughly languiſh,
                  His life was lothſome, with continuall anguiſh.
               
               
                  
                  87.
                  Thus while afflicted with loue-doubts and feares,
                  Hee finds no fit mark for his harts affection:
                  At length accompanied alone with cares,
                  Walking he ſpies by chance, or by election,
                  The liuely picture of Elizabeth,
                  
                  Mongſt other Ladies whom ſhe far ſurpaſſeth.
               
               
                  88.
                  No ſooner did he looke but like: for cold
                  His body ſhooke, his knees began to tremble,
                  His heart and ſence to faile. Then loue him told,
                  Beeing loth his purpoſe longer to diſſemble:
                  She was the Paragon whome Gods aſſignd,
                  For his content he ſhould no better find.
               
               
                  89.
                  His eies aſſured him her proportion
                  Was ſuch as Ioue beholding might affect:
                  His tongue (late mazd) had now got vſe of reaſon,
                  And could not chuſe but thanks and praiſe direct
                  Towards heauenly powers, that ſeing him louer proue
                  They would allot him ſuch a worthy loue.
               
               
                  90.
                  Who would not ſeeke thee (ſaith hee) ſo faire a priſe,
                  When you dread gods) call me though much vnfit:
                  Only let not mine hopes in vaine ariſe,
                  As you began my purpoſe, proſper it,
                  This non pareil for beauty, vertue, ſtate,
                  Shall be my firſt, my laſt, mine only mate.
               
               
                  91.
                  So fauor you my loue. While thus he ſaid,
                  He could not waiue his looks from the faire table,
                  Nor thence remoue his wits aſtoniſhed,
                  Vntill this obiect wonderous amiable,
                  Remou'd into his chamber, night and day,
                  Being neer his louer, did his griefe allay.
               
               
                  92.
                  For this, which he reputes his onely treaſure,
                  He thinks his lodging dearer then all places,
                  In this he takes his moſt delightfull pleaſure,
                  Here he ſpends all his time, no ſport embraces,
                  Neither the theater, nor bounding horſe,
                  Nor following hart nor hare with darts or courſe.
               
               
                  
                  93.
                  Hunting the foaming Boare with ſpeares or Snares,
                  Or catching birds with nets or ſlimy birch,
                  For theſe, or home-vſd games he little cares:
                  His mother and kind equalls wonder much,
                  And offer comfort: like Pygmalion,
                  
                  He woes his Image with deuotion:
               
               
                  94.
                  This vpper face of coulours him deceiues,
                  Changing his wondring thoughts a thouſand wayes
                  Somtimes her perſon preſent he conceiues,
                  Offers to touch, drawes back, feares to diſpleaſe
                  Then pardon begs as if he were too bold,
                  His eyes from ſhedding tears themſelues ſcarce hold.

                  As if it ſpoke or heard, he ſpeakes, replies,
                  And ſomtimes kiſſes, adds, as if it felt,
                  And to thoſe lookes his lookes do ſimpathiſe,
                  Drinking deep loue he doth in fancies melt,

                  Surely the picture calls and proffers grace,

                  Heere Frederick Count Palatine of Rhine
                  
                  Thus makes reply. Greateſt of greateſt Kings,
                  To render thankes for your high grace is mine,
                  Who is't that loueth heauen or heauenly things,
                  To whom Fame ſhall report your Godly zeale,
                  Your gracious rule of Brittaines Common-weale.
               
               
                  
                  16.
                  But ſtraight is mooud like Shebaes royall Queene,
                  To ſeeke the place where Salomen doth liue:
                  That he may ſee the like was neuer ſeene,
                  And heare thoſe leſſons only you can giue,
                  That he may learne aright to ſerue his God,
                  And rule his contries with a Princely rod,
               
               
                  17.
                  Its this (high Monarch) hath Rheins Palſgraue mooud
                  To heare and ſee your Princely Maieſty:
                  With your faire ofſpring whom my heart hath loud,
                  (With that his cheekes receiue a rubie die,
                  Ther ſtayes: where ſtraight as to their royall brother,
                  The Prince of Wales and Rhine ſalute each other.
               
               
                  18.
                  With that our regall and reſplendent Queene,
                  The happy Mother of a hopefull ſpring,
                  In gorgious robes moſt glorious to behold,
                  Preſents her ſelfe before the potent King.
                  Where with reſpect repleat with Maieſty,
                  She bids the Prince welcome to Brittanie.
                  
               
               
                  19.
                  Next with her golden treſſes dangling,
                  Which ſweetly ſport them with her ſweeter breath,
                  Clad with rich Tiſſues all with gold beſpangling,
                  Comes beauties mirror faire Elizabeth,
                  
                  This Ioue deſeruing Princeſſe, nows adreſt,
                  To welcome this imperiall German gueſt:
               
               
                  20.
                  With ſuch a ſpeech as Pallas might giue place
                  Such Maieſty as Iuno might amaze:
                  Such beauty as faire Venus hide her face,
                  All to Eliza yeelding all their praiſe.
                  
                     Ercinia neuer ſaw ſo faire a feature,
                  Mongſt all hir Nimphs as this celeſtiall creature.
               
               
                  21.
                  Struck with amazement of this heauenly ſight,
                  VVas louely Frederick, trembling cold as yce
                  The mighty Prince now wants his manly might,
                  And like he is to fall downe in a trice,
                  (Strange metamorphoſis) nor had he ſtood,
                  Had not her roſie lips reuiu'd his blood.
               
               
                  
                  22.
                  A modeſt maiden kiſſe Nectarian ſweet,
                  Deigns faite Eliza to the danted Reine,
                  
                  In whoſe pure cheeks when both their lips did meet,
                  The roſes with the Lillies did combine,
                  No maruaile for the kiſſe no ſooner done,
                  But ſtraight loues fire to kindle was begun.
               
               
                  23.
                  She feeles a ſparke but knowes not whence it came,
                  Her virgin breaſt nere knew what Cupid meant,
                  The ſpark encreaſeth til it prooues a flame,
                  Yet ignorant withall of loues intent,
                  The perſon, birth, and geſture being ſeen,
                  Of Princely Rhein do pleaſe this beauties Queene.
               
               
                  24.
                  Nor reſts it there, but what ſhe likes ſhe loues,
                  And what ſhe loues, deſireth to obtaine,
                  No leſſe then he, ſhe louers lawes approoues,
                  And feeles no leſſe then he a louers paine,
                  To look at what ſhe loues ſhe lifts her eye,
                  But dare not look for feare ſom other ſpy.
               
               
                  25.
                  Againe ſhe opes her two caeleſtiall ſtars,
                  A little twinckling on this princely mirror,
                  Straight ſhuts them vp; within herſelfe at warres,
                  Loue harts her eye, maides modeſty ſtrikes terror,
                  Thus in loues conflict with chaſt modeſty,
                  She loues, and feares, ſhe ſees, and dares not ſee.
               
               
                  26.
                  But yet ſo cloſly could not this young louer
                  Mooue the faire Orb of her Siderian eyes,
                  But ſtraight the loueſick Palſgraue could diſcouer,
                  And meet the turn with due obſeruancies.
                  Hundred ey'd Argus Io nere ſo tended,
                  As he Eliza til theſe greetings ended.
               
               
                  27.
                  This thus and more perform'd in princely ſort,
                  Dark ſable-coulor'd Nox, comes trotting on,
                  Mounted vpon Allaſter, from the port,
                  Of black Cymmerian pitchy Acheron,
                  
                  
                     Phaebus with fiery chariot flies away,
                  Poſt haſt to giue Antipodes the day.
               
               
                  
                  28.
                  Meane while a guard of gallant Gentlemen,
                  Addreſt in skarlet liueries euery one,
                  With Cognizants firſt drawne with Pallas pen;
                  Then wouen with ſiluer, gold, and pretious-ſtone:
                  In which, Palladian art did vive appeare,
                  King IAMES his arms, great Britans Monarch there.
               
               
                  29.
                  Theſe worthy Waiters, worthy of their places,
                  Preſent their burning tapers 'fore the King,
                  Who with the Queen, and all thoſe Princely graces
                  Addreſt himſelfe to Ioviall banqueting:
                  Which being done (as fitteth Princes beſt)
                  They all retire them to nocturnall reſt.
               
               
                  30.
                  King IAMES no ſooner preſt his lofty bed,
                  And Somnus comes to cloſe his Princely eyes;
                  But Morpheus his fancy wakened,
                  And Conſus counſels god, he ſtraight eſpies:
                  Who ſoftly comes with graue and auncient pace,
                  Comely, though old, with reuerence in his face.
               
               
                  31.
                  With his fur'd night-gowne, ſhooes, &amp; cap for night,
                  In his right hand he brings a golden booke;
                  Thus he preſents himſelfe to IAMES his ſight,
                  Much like old Philon both in ſpeech and look:
                  Who, for in younger age he taught his Grace,
                  His Highnes therfore knew him by his face.
               
               
                  32.
                  Who mildly ſtanding at our Soueraignes feet,
                  He thus begins to ſpeake with grauitie:
                  Great Britans Monarch, giue me leaue to greet
                  Thy mighty ſelfe, and then to queſtion thee:
                  Why'mongſt ſo many doſt thou toſſe thy mind,
                  A match for faire Elizabeth to find.
               
               
                  33.
                  Behold great Ioue by heauens owne direction,
                  Hath ſent thee one, the mirror of his time,
                  Whoſe Aunceſtry next, vnder your protection,
                  May with the beſt compare of Kingly line:
                  Whoſe regiment encreaſeth with his yeeres,
                  In aequi-pollence to the mightieſt peeres.
               
               
                  
                  34.
                  More wiſe he is then young age can affoord,
                  Whom mighty Ioue both loues and offers thee;
                  He doth profeſſe the ſame religious Word,
                  And link't in Chriſtian league of amity:
                  Make this thy Son, this Prince will only proue,
                  He worthy hers, ſhe worthy of his loue.
               
               
                  35.
                  Th'emperiall heauens command me tell thee this,
                  Which promiſe thee and them a royall ſtraine;
                  Who ſhall (for heauens intentions cannot miſſe)
                  Reſtore the golden ages back againe:
                  This ſaid, Mirh-breathing Conſus goes his waies,
                  Leauing the King halfe ſleeping in a maze.
               
               
                  36.
                  He with mature deliberation,
                  Who 'twas was ſent, and who it was that ſent him,
                  Together with his pleaſing graue relation
                  What good Ioue offer'd, and what good he meant him:
                  Theſe reaſons force (quoth he) our full conſent▪
                  
                  Being ſuch, as one had been ſufficient.
               
               
                  37.
                  But moſt of all, Religion ſhe doth moue me,
                  Which all Kings ought to ſtriue for to the death;
                  It's that great German makes vs moſt to loue thee,
                  And hold thee worthy our Elizabeth.
                  
                  Thus Britans Caeſar in his thoughts revolv'd,
                  And thus he ſpake, and thus he them reſolv'd.
               
               
                  38.
                  But do you thinke Eliza's reſt was peace?
                  Thinke you the Princely Virgin was not troubl'd?
                  Herſleep was leſſened by her thoughts increaſe
                  On Frederick, thinking ſtraight her thoughts were doubl'd,
                  To him no ſooner thinks he to be kind,
                  But ſtraight her Princely ſelfe comes to her mind.
               
               
                  39.
                  Aie me (quoth ſhee) what ſodaine motion's this?
                  How is my breſt clogg'd with a bitter ſweet?
                  
                     Cupid hath ſurely ta'ne his ſhaft amiſs,
                  Elce how could Feare and Hope together meete:
                  I know not how but yet, methinks, I ſee,
                  Such vncouth paſſions both at once in me.
               
               
                  
                  40.
                  
                     Loue ſhall not trouble vs, were loue ſo bold
                  To enterpriſe our royall Vigin breſt
                  In vaine it ſtraue to win our maiden hold,
                  That nere ſhall yeild let Cupid do his beſt,
                  Not though loues fire within me were as great,
                  As that Octaean or Trinacrian heat.
               
               
                  41.
                  Vnleſſe my father giue his full conſent,
                  Vnleſſe my King appoint me whom to loue:
                  Loues arrowes are in vaine but idly ſpent,
                  And of no force ſhould all loues forces proue.
                  Hee's worthy Loue, but aie what bootes to like,
                  Vnleſſe my father doe the bargaine ſtrike.
               
               
                  42.
                  Loue? loue would ſure but wither in the blade,
                  Proue barren, fruitles, langviſh and ſo die;
                  Ah Frederick (but that's it makes mee'fraid)
                  I wiſh my father held th' as great as I,
                  Great God of Loue as thou haſt plai'd thy part,
                  To make me Loue, ſo moue my fathers hart.
               
               
                  43.
                  Procure him get a marriage worthy mee,
                  It is not farr his highneſſe need to ſeeke,
                  
                     Fortune preſents fit opportunity,
                  Doe Cupid and Ile kiſſe thy louely cheeke,
                  But yet in all be ſure thou draw a dart,
                  That ſhall not miſſe Prince Frederick to the hart.
               
               
                  44.
                  Mine eies are onely plea'ſd with his faire brow,
                  Me thinks and he ſhould Loue to, by his face;
                  Yet and perhaps the German loues me now,
                  If outward geſture ſhew the inward grace,
                  Why ſhould not I then aunſwer Fredericks Loue,
                  Whoſe were enough an Empreſses to moue.
               
               
                  45.
                  Anſwer (quoth I?) what anſwer ſhall I giue?
                  A virgin, Princeſſe, daughter to a King:
                  Except my Father, vnder whome I liue,
                  Say to me This is he whoſe nuptiall ring
                  Thy Princely ſelfe muſt weare, this is the man,
                  Loue him: then could I anſwer ſoone, I can.
               
               
                  
                  46.
                  Thus with a ſigh her ſpeach ſhe ſmothereth,
                  But loue ſo would not cloſe her waking eies,
                  Which way ſo ere the Vergin turns, vimeth,
                  Shee could but thinke ſhe Frederic eſpies.
                  And more ſhe thinks (ſuch thoughts can fancy moue.)
                  The louely Prince is ſuing for her loue.
               
               
                  47.
                  Nor yet when radiant Phoſphorus appearing,
                  Vſhers Aurora baniſhing the night:
                  The tawney liuery of bright Phebus wearing,
                  Can all-harts-conquering loue bee put to flight,
                  The leſſe her loue ſhe ſeeketh to bewray,
                  The more it's ſeene by ſeeing euery day.
               
               
                  48.
                  How oft would ſhe vnto her mother Queen,
                  
                  Sweetly commend this Princes pedegree:
                  How oft would ſhe haue bluſhing ready been,
                  To tell the titles of his Emperie,
                  
                  His manners now, then's godly youth relating,
                  And then his hopes of age prognoſticating.
               
               
                  49.
                  Her mother Queen obſerues her ſpeeches well,
                  And ſmiling ſayes; Our Daughter is in loue,
                  She likes it tho, and to the King can tell,
                  Her paſſions, which his Highnes doth approue:
                  Yet leaſt ſhe ſhould perceiue they did reioyce,
                  They ieaſted with the Virgine for her choyce.
               
               
                  50.
                  But afterwards the ſapient King perpending,
                  Great Ioues commandement, Rheins great family;
                  His Vertues, Kingdomes, and Religion tending,
                  All to aduancement of true piety:
                  What feare 'twould ſtrike to foes, to hell what terror,
                  What loue both Court &amp; country beares this mirror.
               
               
                  51.
                  Admiring and reioycing in his mind,
                  We ſee in this (quoth he) Ioue hath his hand,
                  Our viſion was none idle dreame we find,
                  Wherein we did receiue the heauens command:
                  Since heauen and Earth and all do promiſe vs,
                  This Princely mariage ſhall proue proſperous.
               
               
                  
                  52.
                  When therefore royall Rhine ſollicets me,
                  (For that befits his errand and our ſtate)
                  I will obey Ioues heauenly deity,
                  And knit that knot which heauens make fortunate:
                  Be bould to ſue, and feareles to receiue,
                  
                     Rhines louely Frederick ſhall but aske and haue.
               
               
                  53.
                  Now as the Caedar or Semelian vine,
                  Hourely encreaſeth in the vernall ſpring,
                  Spreading their braunches with a tender twine,
                  So loue encreaſeth in this loue-ſick King;
                  
                  His eye inflames his hart, his hart endures
                  Loue flames, ſtill feircer, which his eie procures.
               
               
                  54.
                  No maruell for the eie procures the flame,
                  Feeds it procur'd, his eie's both fire and fuell;
                  No ſooner looks he on this beautious dame,
                  But by reflection feeles a heate more cruell.
                  Hers do the like, whoſe cheekes, with ruby die,
                  Bewray her heart, his ſpies ſhe by his eie.
               
               
                  55.
                  Sometimes (but who can write the art of Loue?)
                  Their louely eie-browes ſpeake one to the other;
                  Sometimes a beck, which ſecretly they moue,
                  Maks known the thought which ſilence ſeeks to ſmother,
                  And oft withall when they aſſunder be,
                  They ſigh for ſorrow that they cannot ſee.
               
               
                  56.
                  But Frederick more impatient of delay,
                  Caſts with his Princely Selfe what beſt to doe,
                  How he his thoughts may to the King bewray;
                  And won the Lady, loue incites him to.
                  The former fauors which the King had ſhown,
                  Making him hope Eliza was his owne.
               
               
                  57.
                  Whoſe ſpeach preſented to the King and Queen,
                  
                  They grant faire paſſage to his Princely ſhute;

                  Now moiſt Aquarius with his gelid vrne,

                     AEol within the Cauerns hides his face,

                  Squize the hoare ſnow from twixt her horrid nailes

                  Old yeelds to New, Quarrels to Peace's might,

                  Thou mighty Off-ſpring of Imperiall Race,
                  From whom great Kings do claime their greateſt blood;

                  Thy royall breſt ſcorns worth by meere opinion,
                  Nor holds chiefe honor to poſſeſſe a Crowne,
                  Thy honor'd thoughts are how to raiſe Religion,
                  And in thy kingdomes pull Abuſes downe:
                  In thee gods feare, with innate Piety,
                  And mild aſpect, is mixt with Maieſty.

                  Won by thy fauor, vnconſtrain'd by might:

                  That true-light-giuing word hath gouernment.

                  By thee the Sheep eſcape the iawes of Hell,
                  Without thee Faith would ſcarcely find her name,
                  Thou manſt her cauſe, and doſt performe it wel,

                  Kings were deny'd thy royall ſons to be,
                  Becauſe they did not hold their faiths aright,
                  Thine end was how to eſtabliſh pietie,
                  And on that end moſt bleſſedly haſt light:
                  To happineſſe now nothing doth remaine,

                  And giuen the Goſpell an eternall reſt:
                  In which there is more cauſe of wonder ſhowne,
                  Then when was made the Scots and Engliſh one.

                  108.
                  VVherefore (Sweet Chuck) for my ſake, ready be
                  To help theſe fire-workes, do a maiſters part,
                  Thou art the God of fire, then ouerſee,
                  And teach the Engliſh thine Ignean Art.
                  I would not for the world that Art ſhould miſſe
                  For want of Thee, and then ſhe gaue a kiſſe.
               
               
                  109.
                  Now as the waxen Torch no ſooner feeles
                  The ſcorching heat of Lemnius fire approaching:
                  But ſtraight's on low, euen ſo this Suitor ſteeles,
                  Her Lemman Vulcan with alures incroaching,
                  He briſtles vp, and turning white o'th eye,
                  He thus to Venus gins to make reply.
               
               
                  110
                  (Sweet Duck) what need you to entreat me ſo,
                  You may command, and I muſt needs obey,
                  You know I am yours whether I will or no,
                  Faire Venus wil is Vulcans lock and key,
                  Beſides for this, trouble your ſelfe no more
                  I heard what hand Ioue had in this before.
               
               
                  111.
                  Kind mouſe and (then he knept) lo heeres my hand,
                  For thy ſake I wil do them what I can:
                  I and my forge ſhall be at their command,
                  Or neuer hold me for an honeſtman.
                  As I'me a God, (and then againe he knept)
                  Turn'd white o'th' eye, and ſo the Clubfoot ſlept.
               
               
                  
                  112.
                  No ſooner did this Nuptiall day adproach,
                  And Trumpets warne them of this glorious ſight:
                  But ſome on foot, ſome horſt, ſome in their coach,
                  Repare to Thames with all their maine and might.
                  Where Barges, Oares, and Scullers did appeare,
                  Aweight for Atlas bigge enough to beare.
               
               
                  113.
                  Troopt with his peeres great Brittains King aſcends
                  A lofty ſtately Turret made for view:
                  Vith whom Queene Anne, Prince Charles, Prince Frederick wends,
                  With faire Eliza (oh that heauenly ſhew)
                  So ritch, ſo graue, Maieſtick, are they gone,
                  As if great Ioue aſcended to his throane.
               
               
                  114.
                  With that lame 
                        Ʋulcan from the lofty Tower,
                  Straight falls to worke and gins to ſtir his ſtump:
                  Where with a peale of ordnance for an hower,
                  Giues them faire welcome all with many a thump:
                  VVho yet before his thundring fires were ſhowne,
                  Makes one good legge (God knowes) he had but one
               
               
                  115.
                  Next after this the ſquibs ſkip vp the ayre,
                  Makes cloudes by thouſands, ſpread them like a net:
                  Such like as when the Titans durſt to dare
                  The Gods aboue, and they on Phlegra met,
                  Such were the flaſhes, cracks, and heauens face,
                  As when the Gods had Gyants in the chaſe,
               
               
                  116.
                  But no ſuch feare, withall the nimble fire,
                  Giues eares contentments, pleaſures to the eye:
                  The cunning ſquibs while they the Heauens aſpire,
                  Make twenty ſhapes on houſe and caſements nie:
                  They ſkip, they run, they fall, and keep a quoile,
                  VVhile all the Thames was ready for to boile,
               
               
                  117.
                  Scarce this was done, when by 
                        Ʋulcanian arts,
                  A ſell, fierce, fiery Dragon gins to mount:
                  VVho with his taile the ayre ſo ſwiftly parts,
                  As makes a thunder, Teeth withouten Count.
                  VVhet, gnaſh, and craſh, his Iriſh Dart tonguethere,
                  Threatens to kill and poyſon who comes neere.
               
               
                  
                  118.
                  Saint George on horſeback with his ſpeare and ſheild,
                  Confronts the Serpent, and with martiall looks
                  Makes towards the Dragon in the airy field,
                  And with vndaunted ſpirit his ſpeare he ſhook,
                  The Dragon, in whoſe ſcales laid hart and might.
                  Prouokes this worthy warriour to the fight.
               
               
                  119.
                  Both with like courage and with equall force,
                  They firſt aloofe charge each the other there:
                  Saint George being mounted on his warlik horſe,
                  Aſſailes the Dragon with his conquering ſpeare:
                  The furious Dragon fiercely doth aſſaile,
                  To meet th'encounter with his ſcale arm'd tayle.
               
               
                  120.
                  VVhere he attempts with twining circling rounds.
                  To graſpe the Warriour and to teare his ſkin:
                  
                     George with his ſpeare preuents thoſe murdering wounds
                  And giues the hurt the Dragon ment to him:
                  When mad with ire he makes a horrid yell,
                  Spoutes thundring fire, earth trembling at the knell.
               
               
                  121.
                  Now careles of himſelfe not dreading ill,
                  The Dragon flies to fight neere hand to hand:
                  He feares not death ſo hee his foe may kill,
                  The battell doubtfull for the while doth ſtand,
                  They ſlice the ayre with blowes on either ſide,
                  Till light and thunders through the Regions ride.
               
               
                  122.
                  At laſt theſe doubts Saint George the valiant
                  Puts out of doubt, and hath the Serpent kild:
                  The puiſſant victor vp the ayre doth vaunt,
                  While Earths below with acclamations fild.
                  Thus brauely ending this Vulcanian fight,
                  Another ſhew preſents it ſelfe to fight,
               
               
                  123.
                  On Thames a ſteepy mountaine Vulcan founds,
                  Where buſhes, thickets, hearbs, and flowers appeare:
                  VVhereout a kennell of wel-mouthed hounds,
                  Do rouze a ſtately ſtagge, who flies for feare,
                  He wheeles, imboſts, and runs for feare to dye,
                  They follow chanting with a heauenly crye.
               
               
                  
                  124.
                  At laſt, ſo hotly they the ſttagge purſue,
                  They pinch the haunches of the fearefull Deare;
                  Aire reboating thunders out a new,
                  He ſtriues to ſcape, but ſtill was neare the neere:
                  Forceleſſe at laſt, ſeeing no way but death,
                  He brayes, he weeps, he dies and vaniſheth.
               
               
                  125.
                  Next after this a worke of admiration;
                  For Art, Deuiſe, Nouelty, and Wit
                  Whoſe true deſcription paſſeth my relation,
                  Is ſhow'n theſe royall Princes as they ſit:
                  A ſeeming Martiall Nauy, brauely man'd,
                  Fraught with rich ſpoiles, coms ſayling t'wards the land
               
               
                  126.
                  
                     Thames grones to beare the burden of the weight,
                  Their Oares do make the water ſeeme to rore,
                  Their glittering ſtreamers daze the lookers ſight,
                  Their drums and trumpets deafe all neere the ſhore:
                  Thus the braue warlick Britans do aſſayle,
                  A Turkiſh Towre which they attempt to ſcale.
               
               
                  127.
                  The Trumpets ſound defiance to the Turke,
                  
                  The Turke defies the Britan to his face,
                  On either ſide the ſoldiers fall to work;
                  
                     Turks to ſinke ſhips, Britans the Tower to race:
                  The Tower the Britans batter from the Main,
                  To ſinke the ſhips, the Turks ſhoot back againe.
               
               
                  128.
                  But yet at laſt maugre the Scythians might,
                  The valiant Britans haue attain'd the land,
                  Prouoking of the miſcreants to fight;
                  And while the Turks on wall and Turrets ſtand,
                  With Scythian purfles, ſteele Tartarian bowes,
                  And forked arrowes to reſiſt their foes.
               
               
                  129.
                  Yet in deſpite of theſe the Britan enters,
                  Trumpets, and drums ſtill heart them to the battle,
                  Darts like to ſnow-flags fly in thouſand ſplenters;
                  Cannons make waters, ayre, and earth to rattle,
                  Caſt from Phalarrick inſtruments of warres,
                  The wild-fires fly in number like the ſtarres.
               
               
                  
                  130.
                  Looke how when Aquilo in caues ypent,
                  
                     Aeol vnwitting, breaks his priſon doores,
                  And boiſterous Auſter hath the Cauerns rent
                  To front his Aduerſe, whil'ſt the welkin rores:
                  So fares it with the Mountaines and the Vallies,
                  The while the Britan, 'gainſt the Scythian ſallies.
               
               
                  131.
                  Thus long they combate ſtill with freſh ſupplies,
                  Both pel-mel meeting make their armors clatter,
                  
                     Turks from the Tower fall thick as haile from skies,
                  While warlike Britans do their Turrets batter:
                  So faſt they fall, as ſcarce was one remaining,
                  Of all the Turks their lofty Towers maintaining.
               
               
                  132.
                  With that, the warlike Britans Mars-like bold,
                  With ladders ſtriue the Turrets top to wend;
                  Firſt at the ſcout-holes taking nimble hold,
                  Thence battlemets, and thence to top aſcend:
                  Where the Turks vanquiſht Britans do diſplay.
                  St. George his Croſs in honor of the day.
               
               
                  133.
                  Thus was the firſt day ſpent, where Britans make
                  Their hearts appeare, by their apparant ſhowes;
                  Where Lipareius for his Venus ſake,
                  Preſents theſe vncoth arts to Princely viewes:
                  Now Mars withall to pleaſe his Cyprian Dame,
                  Next day prepares a chiefe Olimpian game.
               
               
                  134.
                  A ſtately place within the Court is built,
                  Smooth as a die, round, emptie, ſpatious,
                  Prepar'd for Martiall Knights to run at tilt,
                  And try in arms who was moſt valorous:
                  In glittering armor euery Gallant's bent,
                  To try his warlick force at Tournament.
               
               
                  135.
                  Where on great horſe with rich Capariſon,
                  Th'heroick Britans long the Tilt-yard ride,
                  Who brauely, ere the tilting was begun,
                  Themſelues into two equall troops diuide:
                  Where to his launce, his Horſe and armor truſting,
                  Each Knight prepares in order for the iuſting.
               
               
                  
                  136.
                  No ſooner ſiluer trumpets gin to found,
                  But ſtraight two Champions one at other flie,
                  Their furious ſteeds make furrows in the ground,
                  Their ſhiuer'd ſpeares pir, whiſtling vp the skie;
                  Thunders and lightnings from their Armes and ſpeares
                  Fly, while their plumes be fir'd about their eares.
               
               
                  137.
                  Thus each in Order with his horſe and lance,
                  His martiall foe ſeemes ſtoutly to defie,
                  VVhere with ſuch fury they them-ſelues aduance,
                  As feare and wonder ſtrike the ſtanders by,
                  Such warlike feats of armes and Chiualry,
                  As mighty Mars himſelfe, admir'd to ſee.
               
               
                  138.
                  Next after this they do erect a Race,
                  To which the ſwifteſt courſers ſhould repaire,
                  VVith proclamations made in euery place,
                  A goulden Cup ſhould be the winners ſhare,
                  The prize, day, hower, and place known euery where,
                  Vnto the courſe repair they far and neer.
               
               
                  139.
                  Where, when they came each leads his nimble ſteed
                  Ore the faire courſe, ſcarſe can the keepers lead:
                  They champ their golden ſnaffles, while they bleed,
                  They foam, they neigh, the earth they proudly tread,
                  They prank, they fret impatient of delay,

            VVe know Loue is as ſtrong as Death,
            But Death to Loue must yeeld:
            For Death is paſt, loue ſtill remaines,
            God Cupid wins the Field.
