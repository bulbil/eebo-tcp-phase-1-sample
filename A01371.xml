            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            To the right Worſhipfull, the Mayor
of the borrough of Kings Lynne, and to his Aſſociats
or Bretheren the Aldermen of the ſame Towne,
C: G: wiſheth much health with proſperitie,
and all happines with eternitie.
            
               
                  PLato that diuine Philoſopher (right Worſhipfull)
dyd caſt out of the common-wealth of
wiſe-men which he made, Homer and Heſiode
two Poets, becauſe he perceyued ſome vanitie
in theyr Poems. Ouid neuer more iuſtlie
deſerued exilement, then for hys laſciuious
verſe, becauſe they incline to the nouriſhment
of vyce.
            If we puniſh ſuch by penall lawes, which vſe falſe waights and
meaſures, thoſe are not to be permitted, vvhich diuulgate corrupt
dyſcourſes: for theſe are meanes to vitiat the minde, the other can
but defraud vs of money.
            That vvhich is infectious to publiſh, muſt needes be infamous
to patronize; it is a credit to giue countenance to a good worke;
for that cauſe I haue made choyſe of ſuch a matter, as ſhall neyther
offend your W. for vanitie in the inuention, or for indignitie in
the protection.
            The Subiect handled is vvarre, the rumor of it is fearefull, and
therefore the diſcourſe of it may be fruitfull; vvhich hauing finiſhed,
I haue preſented to your W. not to that ende many ayme
at, in giuing whereof Gratian ſpeaketh, Do vt des vel do vt facias.
Decret cauſ. 14. To giue to haue giuen agayne, but as a gyft proceeding
of mere good-will; and I am the rather induced heerevnto,
for theſe cauſes.
            Firſt in reſpect of promiſe; the Ciuilians ſay, Vir iuſtus eſt vota
et promiſſa praeſtare, I promiſed long ſince to gratifie your W. with
ſome grauer attempt. The Philoſopher ſayth, that the bird of Egypt
being olde, purgeth all the humors of her bodie, by eating
ſpyces of Arabia, and ſendeth forth of her mouth a ſweete breath;
ſo I hauing expelled the vanities of youth, by the experience of
more yeares, may haue a more rype and ſeaſoned iudgment: for as
Euripides ſayth, the ſecond actions are more ſinguler; vve ſee that

Aritificers be more excellent, in theyr ſecond workes, then much
more are the ſtudies of the minde, alwayes amended by future meditation,
as Cicero ſayth, Poſteriores cogitationes ſapientiores eſſe ſolent,
the latter cogitations are wont to be wiſer.
            Secondly, in regard of your kindneſſe; vvhich not onely deſerueth
to be cannonized for a vertue by the Schoolemen, T. Aqui.
Art, 1, but to be ſpoken of to the reproch of many ingratefull perſons
in thys age: for there be ſome that reſpect not a gyft vvhen it
is giuen; others, that vvill ſooner crucifie then gratifie a well-willer;
but there is in your W. both a ciuill kind of curteſie to accept,
and alſo, more then a common courſe of kindneſſe to requite; now
it is true that Tully ſayth, Omnes immemorem benificii oderunt, all
men hate hym who is not mindfull of a benefite, and therefore if
Heathen men vvould puniſh vnthankfull perſons, with ſeruitude,
as Claudius Caeſar did: Sueton, cap. 25, and vvith death, as the Perſians
dyd, Melanct. lib. 1, vvhat were I worthie to haue, if I ſhould
not remember your kindnes and ſome-way remunerate againe.
            Theſe things conſidered (hauing neyther ſtore of Indian treaſure
to beſtowe, or coſtlie Iuels of Egypt to offer) I could doe no
leſſe then dedicate my labours to your W. 
                  Ʋltra poſſe non eſt eſſe,
there is no defect in affection but in action; but Kings in former
tymes would not refuſe gyfts of good-will, though they brought
but a handfull of vvater; Chriſt him ſelfe dyd accept the widowes
offer, though ſhe gaue but a myte, and therefore I hope you will
not reiect my ſimple preſent, though it be but a peece of paper. So
preſuming of your accuſtomed kindneſſe, I commit the protection
heereof to your W. and the preſeruation of your ſelues, to the
Almightie, vvho make you gloryous Cittizens in heauen, as he
hath made you graue Senators vpon earth.
            
               Your Worſhips alwayes in the Lord,

            To the Reader.
            THE mutabilitie of reports had almoſt diſmaide mee
in proceeding: for one while there runne nothing
but rumors of vvarre, an otherwhile there paſſe manie
ſpeeches of peace; the ſame mouth that ſaith at one
time, the Spanyard will come, another time affirmeth, we
neede not expect his comming. There be many that wiſh
warrs becauſe they cannot thriue with peace, and others
that ſpeak of peace, becauſe they loue not to heare of war;
but (good Reader) as there is no ſmoke without fire, ſo
there ariſeth no rumor without ſome original, for rumors
are commonly fore-runners of warre. VVhen tydings of
vvarre were voyced in Iuda, the enemies tarried not long
after; and therefore the ſpeeches which are giuen out of
the Spanyard, may put vs in expectation of his comming;
he which hath made ſo great preparation for warre, may
be ſuſpected to weight oportunitie to effect his will.
            There were many falſe Prophets amongſt the Iewes,
which perſwaded them of peace for ſome lewd pretence,
when they knew the Aſſyrians were ready to aſſault them,
Ierem, 6, 14. I pray GOD there be not ſome falſe-harted
ſubiects amongſt vs, that giue out reports of peace for ſom
ill purpoſe, when they are perſwaded the Spanyard is approching.
            Howſoeuer it be, dubia timenda, things doubtful are to
be dreadfull; It is better to liue in feare then ſecurity: for
feare maketh vs to flie to God, as Iehoshaphat did when he
feared the Moabites to come vpon him, 2, Chro, 20, 3, but
ſecuritie maketh vs forget God, as Dauid did when hee remained
ſecure in Ieruſalem. 2, Sam, 11. The feare of war
is to be doubted euen in the fruition of peace, for as the
wiſe-man ſayth, There is a time of warre aſwell as a time

of peace, Eccles, 3, 8. Such euer taſt the leſſe troubles in
the tempeſt of warre, which ſayle with a martiall foreſight
in the calme of peace.
            But admit the Spanyarde hath diſperced ſome part of
his Nauie, or hath ſome other croſſe occaſions to hinder
his cōming hether this yere, yet let vs perſwade our ſelues,
that as God made the Amorites and others to be as pricks
and thornes to the Iſraelits, Ioſua, 23, 13, ſo he hath made
the Spaniard to be as a prick &amp; thorne to Engliſhmen, inſomuch
as we ſhall neuer bee ſo aſſured of peace, but wee
may alwaies liue in ſuſpition of warre: and therefore thys
treatiſe of warre cannot be friuolous.
            I remember Cicero ſayth, it is one poynt of policie in
peace to prepare for vvarre; now if outwarde furniture to
defend the body, is expedient to be in preparation, though
there be no vvarre; the inwarde Armour to aſiſt the ſoule,
cannot be impertinent though there be peace.
            Theſe and ſome other reſpects haue mooued me to ſet
forth this Treatiſe, conſidering what Seneca ſaith, Non viuit
qui nemini viuit, he liueth not, that liueth to none but
himſelfe; therefore I thought it to bee a ſinne by concealing,
which might turne to a more profit by publiſhing.
            Thus being loth to put any in feare of vvarre, although
it be good policie to ſuſpect it, or in hope of peace when
the Enemie is ſo buſie about warlike preparation, I leaue
the cenſuring hereof, to ſuch as know beſt vnder God, and
the ſucceſſe of both to him that ſeeth more then any man,
which is the almightie Iehouah, whom Auguſtine ſayth to
be Totus oculus, all Eye, becauſe hee beſt ſeeth all things,
whoſe purpoſe will take place whatſoeuer we heare,
eyther by flying reports, or by fabulous
prophecies.

            Warre.
            THE Latine word Bellum, is ſo called (ſaith Cicero) of
Belluis, cruell, beaſt-like or ſauage; ſome ſuppoſe it
commeth of Bellona, whom the Poets fayned to be
the Goddeſſe of VVarre, whoſe felicity was in the effuſion
of bloode. The Etymologie of the worde dooth not
much differ from the nature of the ſubiect.
            
               There be two kinds of warre,

                     
                        1. Bellum internum.
                     
                     
                        2. Bellum externum.
                     
                  
               
            
            1. Bellum internum, inward warre, is that we commonly
call the ſpirituall warre, therefore this life is very fitlie by
one of the Fathers called a warfare. Auguſt. 45. Ser. de tem.
For the Spirit hath many egregious enemies, which continually
combate and encounter with it.
            The fleſh is called Caro a corrupto, becauſe it dooth corrupt,
or as the Schooleman ſaith, it is called Caro quia corruit,
becauſe it doth ouerthrow. This is one enemie that
impugneth againſt the Spirite; From whence are warres
(ſaith the Apoſtle) euen of your luſtes that fight in your
members: Iam. 4. Heereupon Paule wel alludeth when he
ſaith, Though we walke in the flesh, we doe not warre after it.
2. Cor. 10. 3.
            The world, as one ſaith wel, is called Mundus ab immundo,
for it ſhroudeth much filthines vnder a faire ſhew, therfore

               Austen ſayd not without cauſe, Si te delectat hic mundus,
ſemper vis eſſe immundus: if we take pleaſure in it, wee
ſhal alwaies be impure. This world is another enemy that
warreth againſt the ſpirite. As warre commonly preceedeth
before victory, ſo the Apoſtle approueth the worlde
after a ſort, to warre, by ſhewing the meanes howe to get
the victorie, in theſe words, This is our victory that ouercommeth
the world, euen our fayth. 2. Iohn. 5.
            The deuil, he is called Dlabolus, quia eſt aduerſus, becauſe
he is againſt vs, and therefore Peter calleth him aduerſarie,
1. Pet, 5, 8. Thys deuill is another enemie that warreth againſt
the Spirit, for it is written of him, that hee beeing
wroth with the VVoman, went and made warre with the
remnant of her ſeede. Apoc, 12, 17. S. Gregory ſaith, that the
manifold warres of our fore-fathers, are ſhadowes of thoſe
warres we muſt haue with the deuill. Greg: 23, queſt. capit.
1. niſi bellum.
            
            
               This VVarre is dangerous
in two reſpects,

                     1. of the number of the enimies
                     2. of the nature of the enimies
                  
               
            
            1. Of the Number: for there are three to one. The
Phyloſopher ſayth, Ne Hercules contra duos, hee muſt be a
ſtrong man that is able to reſiſt two, therefore three to one
is greater odds. VVhē 
               Ioſua ſent but three thouſand men
againſt the Citty of Ai, the Cittizens were able to ſhift
with them. Ioſua, 7, 4, but when he ſent thirtie thouſande
ſtrong men againſt it, thē the Cittie was ſoone ſacked. Ioſu.
8, 3. If the bodie be not able to withſtande outward violence
where there is inequalitie of enemies, howe ſhould
the Spirit, where there is ſuch aduantage of the inwarde
aduerſaries?
            
               
2 Of the Nature: for they practiſe all pollicies to preuaile
with the ſpirit: inſomuch as many times they make
a batterie and breach in the very beſt, as in Dauid, Peter, &amp;
diuers other. This ſhort period of the melli-fluous father,
doth pretely deſcribe the nature of theſe enemies, Mundus
clamat decipiam, Caro inficiam, diabolus interficiam, Chriſtus
dicit reficiam: quem ſequereris? the worlde crieth I will deceiue,
The fleſh cryeth I wil infect, the deuill cryeth I will
kill, but Chriſt ſaith I wil refreſh, which of theſe wilt thou
followe? But as there be many mighty and vndermining
enimies againſt the Spirit, ſo God hath not left it deſtitute
of aſsiſtance to animate it.
            There is no King will ſend foorth his ſubiects without
weapons in outward warres: euen ſo the king of al kings,
hath dealt by the Spirit in this inward warfare; for he hath
not left it naked and open to the enemies, but hath gyuen
it Armour for the defence, as the Breſt-plate of righteouſnes,
the Shielde of fayth, the Helmet of ſaluation, the
Sword of the Spirit. &amp;c. Ephe, 6.
            This ſpirituall Armour is of greater force to ſubdue the
inward enemies, then politique weapons are to repell the
outward aduerſaries: therfore Paule ſaith, the weapons of
our warfare are not carnall but mightie through God to
caſt downe holds. 2, Cor, 10, 4.
            In other warres, the Souldiers neuer goe to fight without
a Captaine to conduct them, euen ſo hath God delt by
the Spirit, it hath Chriſt to be the Captaine, and therefore
wee are called Souldiers, becauſe wee fight vnder his banner.
Now if Saule had good ſucceſſe in his battels, becauſe
Dauid being a godly Generall directed his bands, the Spirite
ſhall ſpeed well in this conflict, becauſe Chriſt is the
Captaine, who is farre better then Dauid.
            
            Humaine Captaynes will ſometime recoyle and ſhrinke

from their Souldiers in extreamities, this heauenly Captaine
will perſiſt with his Souldiers in all perills: for (as one of
the ancient writers ſayth) he will ouer-looke vs fighting,
ſuccour vs fainting, and crowne vs ouercomming.
            
               This ſpirituall VVarre
of all other warres is moſt

                     Fearefull.
                     Famous.
                  
               
            
            It is moſt fearefull in many reſpects, for firſt, if we faint
in this fight, it is commonly the cauſe of all other warres,
for outward warres are ſent to intimate Gods indignation
for our ſecuritie, to the end we might be excited and fortified
in this ſpirituall fight. God would neuer ſende outward
enemies to afflict the bodie, but that hee perceiues
the inward enemies doe preuaile with the Spirit.
            2 In other warres, though wee bee taken captiues, yet
we may be ranſommed for money, but if wee be ſubdued
by the ſpirituall enemies, there is no hope of raunſome, as
the Pſalmiſt ſayth. Hee cannot giue his raunſome to God, Pſal,
49, 7.
            3 In other warres, we can but looſe our goods, lyms,
or (at the vttermoſt) our lyues, though the enemies work
their wills on vs: but in this ſpirituall battell we looſe both
bodies &amp; ſoules if the enemies get the vpper hand. Therefore
S. Ierom ſaith wel, Septies ſtultior eſt, ego qui nudo corpore
poneret ſe in medio hoſtium armatorum: that ſuch an one
is ſeauen times more fooliſh, or in worſe plight, then hee
which doth hazarde his naked body in the midſt of an armed
hoſt.
            It is moſt famous if the Spirite preuaileth: for in other
warres, ſuch as gette the conqueſt, may perhaps purchaſe
ſome momentanie riches or renowne amongſt men: but
in this inward warre, if we be victorious, we ſhall obtaine
a Crowne, not of gold, but of glory, not earthly, but eternall.

               Reuel. 3.
            
            Men in outward battels, will venture farre to gette the
victory, in regard of peace or praiſe, then howe couragious
ought wee to be in this ſpirituall combat, to gette the
conqueſt, that we may attaine the celeſtiall paradiſe, where
the pleaſures are inexplicable, 1, Cor, 2, 9: and indeterminable,
Pſalm, 16, 11. Theſe reaſons were ſufficient to enforce
vs to be vigilant and valiant in this inward warre.
            
               2 Bellum externum, outward
war is of three ſorts

                     1 Innaturale.
                     2 Ciuile.
                     3 Commune.
                  
               
            
            1 Bellum innaturale, vnnaturall warre, is ſuch as carrieth
vvith it a kinde of abhorrencie in nature,
            
               VVhereof there be two ſorts,

                     VVarre of ignorance.
                     VVar of knowledge.
                  
               
            
            VVarre of ignorance, is that which the Heathens vſed
when they did ſacrifice theyr children to the fire, or ſley
them to ſome cerimoniall end. Therefore the VViſeman
ſayth, they liued in Immagno inſcitiae bello, great warres of
ignorance, VViſdom, 14, 21.
            Such was the vvarre which Paule made in perſecuting
the Saints, which hee confeſſeth himſelfe he did of ignoraunce.
            VVarre of knowledge, was the warre of ſome of the
people of Ieruſalem, of whom it is ſaide, that they filled
that place with the blood of innocents. Ierem, 19.
            Such was alſo the vvarre of bloody Boner in Queene
Maries dayes, in the deſtruction of ſo many Martyrs.
            1 The Heathen men had no illumination but by the light

of nature, and therefore their ignorance is the more to be
excuſed. Acts 17, 30. But as for thoſe of Ieruſalem, and that
bloodie Boner, their warres cannot be iuſtlie ſayd to be of
ignorance: for the Prophets reproued the one often times
for the fact, and the Martirs alledged Scriptures to the other,
alwayes to diſproue his proceedings.
            2 Bellum ciuile, ciuill warre is that vvhich ariſeth within
a Nation it ſelfe.
            
               Thys warre is eyther

                     Of Deuiſion
                     Of Rebellion.
                  
               
            
            Of Diuiſion, when a land is deuided within it ſelfe, as
when two ſtriue for gouernment, ſuch diuiſion was in the
land of Iuda, betweene Rehoboam and Ieroboam, as you may
reade in the 1. Kings 12, and the like diuiſion is, or was in
Fraunce betweene the lawfull King and Duke de Mayne.
            
            Of Rebellion, when ſubiects doe repugne or rebell againſt
their King, as we reade of Abſalom, how he rebelled
againſt King Dauid to dirept the diademe from him, and
here-vnto may be added theſe (not much different in nature
but in name) which we call, Conſpiracy, Inſurrection,
Commotion, Mutinie, &amp;c. VVhereof we haue examples.
VVe reade of Zimri how he conſpired againſt King Elah,
1. King 16. we may ſpeake more properly of all theſe practiſes
within this land, of the ſiniſter and ſundrie conſpiracies
againſt the perſon of our Prince, of the vnnaturall inſurrection
in the North, of the vnkind commotion of Ket
and his confederates, but as their actions be odious, ſo
their endes were ignominious.
            3 Bellum commune, common VVarre, ſome call it Nationall,
the warre of Countries, of this warre our Sauiour

Chriſt ſpeaketh when hee ſaith, Nation ſhall riſe agaynſt
Nation, and Realme againſt Realme, Math. 24. 7. Of this
warre becauſe occaſion and opportunitie is offered (by
reaſon the Spanyard is ſuſpected to riſe againſt England) I
will intreat of for our comfort.
            
               Thys kinde of VVarre bringeth
a feare vvithall two vvayes.

                     1. Auditione.
                     2. Actione.
                  
               
            
            1 The very rumor or heare-ſay of this warre is dreadfull.
Ioſephus reporteth that when it was voyced that Tryphon
had gathered a great Hoſt to come into the lande of
Iuda, the people were in great trembling and feare, Antiq.
13. cap. VVhen the children of Iſrael heard that the Philiſtims
would come againſt them, the text ſaith they were
afraid, 1. Sam. 7. 7. VVhen tydings was brought to Iehoshaphat
how the Amonites intended to battell againſt him,
the Scripture ſaith that Iehoshaphat feared, 2. Chro. 20. VVe
ſee by experience in our ſelues, that when it is giuen out,
the Spanyard prepareth to come againſt vs, how many of
vs be ſmitten with a kind of feare, when we do but heare
of it.
            2 If the rumour and report of warre bee ſo fearefull,
what is the very action it ſelfe. I remember a pritty inſtance
to this purpoſe, when Dauid was to incounter with his enemies,
ſome of his men ſayd vnto him: See wee be afrayde
heere in Iuda, how much more if we come to Kelah againſt the
hoſt of the Philiſtims. 1, Sam. 23, 3. Let vs applie this to our
ſelues, if we be afrayd to heare of warres at home in our
houſes, how fearefull would we be if we came in the face
of the enemie? Saule was a notable and worthy warrior:
for he had ſore warres all his dayes, 2, Sam. 3, 1. Yet is it
written of him, that when he ſavve the hoſt of the Philiſtims,
he was afrayd and his heart was ſore aſtonied, 1, Sam.
               
28, 5. Then no maruaile though England (hauing dwelt
vvithout feare vnder our gracious Queene, as Iſrael did
vnder Salomon, 1, Kings 4, 25) ſhould be ſomewhat fearefull
of vvarres, becauſe it hath beene accuſtomed to peace,
when Saul was ſo fearefull that was neuer without warre.
            Many men are feared for many reſpects, ſome man is
feared for his godlineſſe as Dauid was, an other is feared for
his vviſedome as Salomon was, but the Spanyard he is feared
for his crueltie as Pharaoh was, and therefore who feareth
not to be afflicted of ſuch as haue no feare of God?
            
               VVee muſt conſider
there is a two-fold feare,

                     
                        1 Timor laudabilis.
                     
                     
                        2 Timor deteſtabilis.
                     
                  
               
            
            1 Timor laudabilis, It is a laudable feare, when men by
that meanes are exſcited to looke vnto the Lord, this feare
was in Iehoshaphat a godly King, it is ſayd that hee feared
and ſet him ſelfe to ſeeke the Lord, 2, Chro. 20, 3. Fleſh and
blood is fraile, and therefore ſoone affrighted, but happie
are thoſe which in their feare, can follow ſo good a courſe
as this King did.
            There be others that are terrified by remembrance of
theyr miſdeeds, and feare that God will afflict them, and ſo
by this meanes they are mooued to amendement; Thys
feare is laudable. VVhen iudgements were pronounced,
and impendant vppon Sion, it is ſayde the Sinners were afraid,
and a feare came vpon the hypocrits: Eſay, 33, 14, &amp;
therefore, if thys feare vpon vs, ariſe by reaſon of our ſins,
and for feare of Gods wrath wee depart from them, wee
neede not feare the Spaniard, though he put vs in feare of
vvarre.
            
               2 Timor deteſtabilis, deteſtable
feare proceedeth two wayes,

                     Of Cowardice,
                     Of Deſpayre.
                  
               
            
            
               
Of Cowardice, ſome are afrayd of their owne ſhadow,
as Gaal was, who tooke the ſhadow of the Mountains for
men: Iudg, 9, 36. Now, as a coward can doe little good
in the vvarres with his weapon, ſo he may do much hurte
with his words by diſcouraging others: and therfore this
martiall exhortation was made in Deut, 20, 8, VVhoſoeuer
is afrayd and faynt-harted, let him goe and returne vnto
his houſe, leaſt his bretherens hart faynte like his hart.
There be many ſuch faint-harted men, which doth argue
no humanitie but effemenacie. VVhen open proclamation
was made in the warres of Gedeon that ſuch ſhould returne
home which were timerous or fearfull, of 32. thouſande,
there departed 22. thouſand men away, Iudg, 7, 3. If the
Spaniards come againſt vs, let vs not be fearefull, conſidering
our cauſe is ſo good, that wee ought to ſhewe our
ſelues couragious, and not covvards.
            3 Of Deſpayre; If God caſteth feare vpon a man, and
in his feare he diſpaire of Gods protection, this is to bee taken
for a great puniſhment, becauſe it is inflicted vpon the
wicked, as appeareth in Deut, 28, 66, Thy life ſhall hange
before thee, and thou ſhalt feare both night and day. And
in Leuit, 26, 36, I will ſend a faintnes into their harts. It
was the iudgement God impoſed vpon the impious Babilonians,
that theyr hands ſhall be weakened, and theyr
harts melt, and they ſhal be afrayde: anguiſh and ſorrovve
ſhal take them, Eſay, 13, 8, and therefore, howſoeuer it
fall out, God defende vs from this feare, yea though wee
ſhould take a little foyle of the enemie, as the Iſraelits dyd
of the men of Ai, farre be it from vs we ſhould be ſo fearfull
that our harts ſhoulde melt away like water, as theyrs
did, Ioſua 7, 5, in ſeioyning fayth from feare.
            
               
               VVe muſt conſider
for our benefite generally
three things,

                     1 VVhat VVarre is.
                     2 VVho is the Author of it
                     3 VVherefore it is ſent.
                  
               
            
            
               1. What Warre is.
               THE Poets fayned VVarre to bee a Riuer running
with blood, by reaſon of the manifolde and miſerable
maſſacres and ſlaughters. VVe read in Eſay, how
the Lorde threatned ſo great a ſlaughter among the Moabites,
that the waters of Dimon ſhall be full of blood, Eſay
15, 9: ſo merciles are men in vvarre that it may wel be true
which Homer ſayth, There is ſome ſacietie of all things,
except it be of war.
               Some other of the Ethnick wryters, haue deemed war
to be a fire alwaies flaming, becauſe they commonly vſe to
conſume Citties and Townes when they are beſieged,
with fire, as Iericho was by Ioſua, &amp; Ieruſalem by the king
of Babel.
               Theſe bee rather deſcriptions of the fruites and effects
of vvar, then a true definition.
               The Phyloſophers define vvar to be the pride of Princes;
VVee reade of Alexander, that hee was ſo aſpyring
minded, that he thought the whole world too little to ſatisfie
his luſt;
               Thys is no perfect definition; for by thys reaſon vvee
may define war to be a matter of ingratitude, becauſe Dauid
tooke occaſion by the vnkindnes of Hanun to attempt
warre, 2, Sam, 10, 7.
               Some of the vvryters define vvar to be a forceable and
hoſtile diſcention, vndertaken by lawfull Edict for the repreſsing
of iniuries; Thys is the inferior and actiue definition,

but not the effectuall: for vvar is nothing elſe but a
diuine ſcourge for ſinne; Eſay 10, 26, Deut, 28.
               IF VVarre be a ſcourge, wee muſt not laugh &amp; ſet light
by it: for as wee deeme that childe graceles which will
not ſhed teares when hee is ſcourged of his Maiſter, ſo
we are to be thought godles, if we will not ſorrow &amp; implore
vnder the ſcourge of God.
               
                  Thys meeteth with two contrary motions,
vvhich proceede of ſiniſter

                        Greefe.
                        Ioy.
                     
                  
               
               1 Siniſter griefe is that, which is conceiued vpon carnall
occaſions; as for example, it may bee there are manie
vvhen they heare of vvarrs, it is grieuous to them in tvvo
reſpects.
               
                  1 Of theyr expence.
                  2 Of theyr ſeruice.
               
               1 Of theyr Expence, becauſe they are to bee at ſome
charges in prouiding of Armour, and other martiall contributions:
vvhat a contemptible and griple griefe is this.
               There is no Prince in Chriſtendome euer poſſeſſed
peace ſo long as our gracious Soueraigne; It is vvritten of
Iuda and Iſraell, they dwelt vvithout feare, euery man vnder
his own Vine, 1, Kin. 4, 25, the like hath been verified
by vs in England; Reade throughout all Chronicles, and
ſee howe many of her predeceſſors had the like Alcion
dayes. Search the Scriptures, and you ſhall find how that
beloued Lande of Iſraell neuer had the like fruition of
peace as Englande had, vnleſſe it were in Salomons dayes;
Diſcend into other Countries, and you ſhall ſee hovve the
Lovve Countries haue beene afflicted with vvar 23. yeeres
together; hovve Fraunce hath neuer beene free from intermiſsiue
vvarrs; as for Spayne, I need not ſpeake of it.
               
                  
Theſe things conſidered, what ingratefull and diſloyall
perſons are theſe, vvhich hauing by continuance of peace
gathered plentie, and with theyr plenty are ſo vncheerefull
to part with a little to defend theyr Queene and theyr
Countrey? Tully hath a prety ſaying, Hee that deſireth
peace, let him prepare for vvar. How can a man be ſure to
poſſeſſe any thing in his owne Country, vnleſſe hee prouideth
to repell the enemie that commeth againſt it; Therefore
that is a very mellifluous ſaying of one of the Fathers,
Sumptus pro militia honorabilis eſt, the coſt for vvarfare is
very honourable, for it is a meane to defend our liues, lyberties
and lyuings, and to preſerue our wiues and children.
Miſerable are thoſe men that will not ſtrayne themſelues
at a pynch to defend theſe, vvhen of couetouſneſſe
by ſparing coſt, they may be conſtrayned to forſake all.
               2 Of their Seruice, others are grieued at VVarres, becauſe
they muſt then leaue their wiues, children &amp; goods,
or rather becauſe they muſt hazard theyr liues? Far better
it is for one to venture his lyfe like a man, then to be killed
in his houſe like a beaſt; Is it not better to hazard the lyfe
of one in an houſe, then in forbearing to fight, to bring in
daunger the whole familie? The diuine Philoſopher ſaith,
Naſcimur pro Patria, we are borne for our Countrie, and
therefore we muſt regard our Prince and common-weale
more then our owne priuate liues. 2, Sam. 10, 12. VVee
haue example in Iudith, who for the good of her Country,
put her life in great hazard in the hoſt of Olofernes, let not
the courage of a woman condemne the humanitie of a
man; for that is a reproch. Ierem. 51, 30. VVho can dye a
more honorable death then for his Countrie, therfore we
ſhall reade that amongſt the Romaynes there were the Decians,
Codrians, and the brethren called Phileni, and amongſt
the Grecians, there were Marathonia, Salanina, and diuers

others, who of their owne accord gaue their liues for their
Countries. D. P. Martir in Com. Rom. Brutus for the
preſeruation of his Countrie, did ſlay his owne children.
Virgil thus writeth of him; Vicit amor patriae, &amp;c. Let not
vs which be Chriſtians haue leſſe loue and aleageance then
Heathens.
               From hence there is a good note to be obſerued of ſuch,
who by vnequall oppreſsing and ill intreating, may be the
cauſe of this kind of griefe, therefore they are to conſider
how they may for their owne priuate diſpleaſures oppreſſe
and abuſe men vnder colour of ſome lawfull buſines.
               
                  Iniury &amp; anger may be offered
and effected vnder.

                        1 Office.
                        2 Arte.
                     
                  
               
               
                  1 Vnder office by theſe two,

                        A Magiſtrate.
                        A Captayne.
                     
                  
               
               By a Magiſtrate, amongſt the Romaynes, the Senators
were called Patres conſcripti, appoynted Fathers: for a
Magiſtrate is nothing but a father of the Country, yet ſuch
an one as hath deriued authoritie for theſe cauſes, as no
man doubteth but hee may ſhow much fauour where he
affecteth, ſo all men may know if hee beareth a grudge to
one, he may meete with hym vnder colour of his Commiſion
many wayes; He may rayſe him in the Subſedie without
equalitie: he may pack him forth for a common Souldiour,
though he be vnfit, he may ouer-charge hym with
Supplyes, &amp;c. He may in other matters remember hym, as
in extreame taxations for the poore, in vnreaſonable ratements,
for a Towne, &amp;c: Albeit I knowe not (and I pray
God there be not) ſuch, yet it may fall out to be true which
Alexander ſayde to Mammea, there is nothing ſometyme

more pernitious to a common wealth, then to haue things
done by Deputies. D. Mar. in com. Rom. cap. 12, fol. 418.
               VVee haue examples in the Scriptures, of ſuch as haue
coloured their owne malice and dyſpleaſures, vnder pretence
of ſome lawfull buſines.
               
                  Haman had a priuate malyce againſt Mordecai, becauſe
hee would not moue hys cap or doe hym reuerence, hee
would not for ſhame ſeeme to reuenge it himſelfe, though
he were in great office, but he thought he would be euen
with hym vnder colour of the Kings buſines by ſome deuiſe
or other, as you may reade in Eſter, 3, 8, &amp;c.
               The Rulers and Gouernors had a ſecret ſpite to Daniell,
becauſe he was far in fauor with the King, yet they would
not offer hym an immediat bad meaſure, but they conſulted
among them ſelues, to moue the King to make a Law,
that by colour thereof, they might haue theyr myndes of
good Daniell. Dan. 6, 8, &amp;c.
               If any of our Magiſtrates ſhould colour theyr own pryuate
malyce vnder the Queenes buſines, although theyr
ſecret pretence be no more known to her Maieſtie, then
the intendment of theſe practiſes were to the Kings, yet by
theſe examples let them feare, leaſt their dooings come to
lyght, as the other dyd (albeit they deſerue not ſo fearefull
a puniſhment as befel thoſe) that they purchaſe diſpleaſure
of theyr Prince, vvho cannot abide to bolſter ſuch abuſes.
               By a Captayne, who knoweth not how ſuch as be experimented
profeſſors of Armes being in office and action,
are a kind of protection for the tyme to certayne perſons;
for this cauſe when Dauid vvas a Captayne in warre,
there gathered to hym all men that were in trouble, and
all men that were in debt, and all thoſe that vvere vexed
in mind, and he vvas their Prince or Captayne, 1, Sa. 22, 2.
Beſides, it is not to be ſpoken howe many waies they may

pleaſure a man in vvar, if they be vvilling; yet on the contrarie
if a Captayne be offended at his Souldier and beare
hym in the ſplene, he may quyte it vnder colour of hys office:
hee may make martage of hym, hee may vvearie hym
with vvants and diſcurteſies, hee may cauſe him to end his
dayes in euery light skirmiſhe; He vvas a VVarriour that
ſayd ſo himſelfe, and no meruaile, for we haue an example
of it in the Scriptures, Ioab did of purpoſe place Vriah in
the fore-front of the battell, that he might be ſlaine by the
Philiſtims: Vriah and all the Hoſt were ignorant of the
murderous intent, but Ioab did it vnder colour of his office,
becauſe hee was a Captaine. That God which ſeeth
the ſecrets of the hart did behold this homicide, &amp; hee left
not him vnpuniſhed which procured it; The acte vvas
doone in ſecrete to auoyde ſhame amongſt men, but the
puniſhment was publique, that it might bee example to others.
VVhich example may be a warning to all VVarriors,
to teach them to take heede how they reuenge theyr
owne priuate diſpleaſures, vnder the colour of theyr lawfull
callings. 2, Sam, 12, 12.
               
                  2 Vnder Art, by ſuch as theſe

                        Chirurgians, Phiſitions &amp; diuers other
                     
                  
               
               Theſe men, if they bee angry with a man (eſpeciallie if
he be their patient) they may effect it vnder colour of their
Arte or practice: but becauſe it is impertinent in this place
to ſpeake of, I will pretermit it.
               Ioy, as we haue heard of ſome which are ſorry, ſo there
be others which reioyce to heare of vvarres.
               
                  
                  This ſiniſter Ioy is commonly
incident to theſe

                        1 Martiall attendants.
                        2 Deſperate perſons.
                        3 Vnskilfull perſons.
                     
                  
               
               
                  1 Martial attendants be ſuch as theſe

                        Decayed ſouldiers.
                        Vnder officers.
                        VVarlike workmē.
                     
                  
               
               Decayed Souldiers, ſuch as depende vpon warres, they
are welcome to them, for they perceiue the world is come
to this paſſe, that as the Phiſition is but little regarded but
in time of ſicknes, ſo Souldiers are but little ſet by but whē
there is neede of theyr ſeruice; Certes it is pittie that anie
approoued Souldier ſhould be put to ſhifts. Valorous Caeſar
would neuer ſuffer it in his time; miſery may conſtraine
a man too much; but yet for any to reioyce when there is
common cauſe of ſorrow, and for his owne priuate commoditie,
to deſire a generall calamitie, the one argueth his
diſſolute minde to God, and the other bewrayeth him to
be a bad member to his Country. I would haue ſuch men
as theſe conſider, that the vſe of many things may be good
though the things thēſelues be naught. M. Caluin to that
effect ſayth, Purus eſt multarum rerum vſus, quarum vitioſa
eſt origo. Cal. in Math. cap. 5, verſe 37. The vſe of manie
things is pure, whoſe originall is impure. From hence I
infer, that although the vſe of a Souldiers is neceſſary, yet
to profeſſe a ſouldier (as Eraſmus ſayth) is of it ſelfe the
puddle and ſincke of all miſchiefe; For to lyue by ſpoyles
and ſpilling of blood what life more miſerable; Beſides, it
is nothing delectable to God, but rather maketh any leſſe
acceptable in ſome good action, as we reade of Dauid, who

was not onely a valiant, but a vertuous warrior, but when
he went about to builde the Temple, the Lord ſayde hee
ſhould not, becauſe he had been a man of warre, and had
ſhed blood. 1, Chro, 28, 3.
               Vnder officers, ſuch as may reape any profit in theyr
places, as Clarks of Bands, which may get ſome benefite
by the Booke, by entering, altering, or quitting of Souldiers:
theſe are glad of warrs for gayne ſake. Notable is
that example of Gehaſi for this purpoſe; Elisha was a good
man, hee dyd a notable cure in the Syrian Captaine for
meere good will without any gyfts, but his ſeruant Gehaſi
without his knowledge, would needes take a brybe. VVe
haue many godly Lieuetenants and Captaines in Europe,
who although they themſelues reſpect rewardes no more
then Elisha did, yet ſuch as be vnder them (without theyr
priuities) perhaps like Gehaſi doe looke to get ſome-vvhat
that way, to be gratified one way or other. But as Gehaſi
for his couetous act was afterward turned away by his
Maiſter, with a grieuous puniſhment, 2, Kings 5, ſo let
theſe take heede leaſt theyr dooings be diſcerned by their
Maiſters, and they be put out of office with diſpleaſure, as
Gehaſi was.
               VVarlike workmen, ſuch as lyue by making, mending,
or ſelling of Armour, warres are welcome to them, for as
the Lawyers thriue beſt when men are moſt litigious, ſo
are they in time of warre moſt ſet to worke, for in tyme of
peace they profit not; Therefore, as ſome bad Lawyer
doth ſecretly wiſh that men would be contentious, that he
might haue Clyents, ſo it fareth vvith theſe kinde of men,
they vviſh warres, that they may haue vvorke: they care
not vvhoſe houſe be on fire, ſo theyrs be ſafe, they grieue
not at warre, becauſe it is ſent for a puniſhment, but they
reioyce at it, becauſe it is occaſion of theyr profit.
               
                  
2 Deſperate perſons, ſuch as haue nothing to looſe,
nor wyfe or chyldren to looke to, they are glad of warres,
all Countries are a lyke to them, hab, nab, fall backe, fall
edge, all is one to them, vvhether they be friendly foes to
the enemy, or deadly enemies to their Country; ſo they
may ſhift, they care not what ſhift they make; they laugh
when they ſee others lament, it doth them good to ſee other
men waſte their goods, becauſe they haue nothing:
they will rayle, and doe hope to raigne ouer rich me one
day; they will not let to ſay they looke to bee owners of
theyr lyuings, &amp; to haue their poſseſsions when they ſhall
liue in pouerty; As we read of the beſieging of Ieruſalem,
how the rich were killed or made captiues, but as for the
poore, they were left ſtill liuing, &amp; the enemie gaue them
the Vineyards and Fieldes of the rich men. Iere. 39, 6, 10.
               3 Vnskilfull perſons, they reioyce at war becauſe they
know not what it is, as the Phyloſopher ſaith, Dulce bellum
inexpertis, warre is ſweete to ſuch as neuer taſte it, becauſe
in ordinary traynings, they vſe to skirmiſh for theyr learning:
or in theyr May-games for delight; They thinke
warre to be a matter of merriment. Alas, it is an eaſie matter
to play Hercules in our houſes, or Alexander vppon the
ſtages: but it is ſomewhat to follow thē in the field, where
euery bullet doth threaten death.
            
            
               2 Who is the Author of Warre.
               
                  VVe muſt cōſider that there is

                        1 A ſpeciall Author.
                        2 A manuall Author.
                     
                  
               
               1 THE ſpeciall Author is GOD, as appeareth by
his owne ſpeech, when hee ſaith: I will ſende

plagues vpon them, the ſword ſhall kill them without, and
in the Chambers feare. Deut, 32, 22, 25. It is ſaid in the Parable,
that the King ſent foorth his VVarriors. Math, 22, 7.
               The Iſraelits confeſſed all their afflictions to come of
God: for (ſay they) he hath ſpoyled vs, and hee will heale
vs, he hath wounded vs, and he will binde vs vp. Hoſ. 6, 1.
He is therfore called the Lord of Hoſts, becauſe hee ruleth
and raigneth our all hoſts.
               2 The manuall Author, to our apprehenſion is the Enimy,
becauſe wee perceiue the Spanyarde maketh great
preparation, and purpoſeth to come againſt vs; Many of
vs take him to be the Author, in that he appeareth to be
the Actor. Auguſtine ſaith well, they which make vvarre,
are not ſo much th Authors as the Miniſters of God, Aug.
10. queſt. ſuper Iohn: for he is both the Paſsiue, Miſsiue, &amp;
motiue Author, as appeareth by pregnant examples in the
Scriptures.
               He is the Motiue Author, for he mouth and ſtirreth vp
the Enemie, or els he could not come. The Philiſtims and
Arabians came againſt Iuda, to deſtroy it, yet they came
not of their owne accord, for it is written, the Lord ſtyrred
vp againſt Iehoram (the King of Iuda) the ſpirit of the
Philiſtims: 2, Chro, 21, 16. The Medes &amp; Perſians made
warre againſt Babilon, thys was not their owne voluntary
act, for the Lord had ſayd before, I will ſtyr vp the Medes
againſt it. Eſay, 13, 17. Therefore we may gather frō theſe
examples, that if the Spaniard with his confederates bend
their forces to vs, it is not altogether his own ſeeking, but
God which exciteth him to it; For as P. Martyr ſayth, It is
God that ſtirreth vp cruell Princes &amp; Tyrants, which may
be called the hoſt of God. In com. Rom.
               
               He is the Miſsiue Author: for after he hath excited the
Enimy, he ſendeth him, or els he could not approch. The

Chaldees, Aramites, Ammonites, and Moabites beſieged
Iudah, their comming conſiſted not in their own election,
for it is written the Lord ſent againſt him (that is the King
of Iudah,) bands of the Chaldees, bands of the Aramits,
&amp;c. 2, Kings, 24, 2. Nabuchadnezar with his power came againſt
Ieruſalem to deſtroy it, the choyſe was not in him
to tarry or retyre, for the Lord had ſaid before, I wil ſend
them. Ierem, 25, 9. Now, if the Spaniard hath a purpoſe
to come againſt vs, it is in God to diſpoſe: his comming lieth
not in his owne liberty, but the Lords.
               He is the Paſsiue Author: for albeit he firſt ſtirreth, and
afterward ſendeth the Enimy, yet he can do nothing whē
he is come, without Gods ſufferance. The Iſraelits had
grieuouſly tranſgreſſed, for which cauſe they fell into the
hands of theyr enimy: the enemy could not haue preuailed
without Gods permiſsion; for it is written that God
deliuered them into the hands of ſpoylers that ſpoyled
them. Iudg. 2, 14.
               Sith it is God that ſtirreth, ſendeth and ſuffereth the Enimy
to doe his good pleaſure, they are but his ſeruants, as
the Lord termed Nabuchadnezer his ſeruant, Ierem, 27, 6.
Or his inſtruments, as Eſay calleth them, the weapons of
his wrath, chap, 13, 5. And they are ſo fitly called, becauſe
the Lord doth make them ſerue him by conſtraint, &amp; that
which they doe of malice, hee directeth and turneth it to
his honour and glory; ſo that frō hence we may conclude
that God is the ſpeciall Author of VVar.
               
                  In that God is the
Author, we may obſerue
three thinges,

                        1 His power by the effects.
                        2 His diſpleaſure by the action.
                        3 His loue by the end.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
1 His power by the effects, though Kings and Princes
are as Gods vpon earth, yet there is a God aboue them,
who can brydle theyr wills as hee will: this ſhould teach
vs to relie vpon God: for admit the Spanyard hath a purpoſe
to come againſt vs, yet this is our comfort, hys heart
is in the handes of God, whoſe power is ſuch, that if it be
hys good pleaſure, hee can alter the determination of the
Spanyard, before he ſetteth forth to fight, as he did by Rehoboam,
when hee was bent to vvarre againſt the Iſralites.
1, Kings 12, 24: He can intercept his comming when hee
is vpon the Seas, and drowne hym, as he did Pharaoh and
hys hoſt. VVhen hee is about our Coaſtes, hee can put a
hooke into hys noſtrils, as hee dyd by Senacherib, and
make hym returne that vvay he came, 2, Chro. 32, or hee
can diſpierce and ſcatter them into vnknowne Coaſtes, as
he dyd by the Spanyard his laſt viage. Such is the power of
God, as one of the auncient Fathers ſaith, that there is not
any thing done, but that he would haue to be done, either
ſuffering it to be done, or hee hym ſelfe doing it. Auguſt.
lib. voc. Enchiredion ad Laurentium.
               
               2 Hys diſpleaſure by the action; for it is an argument
of his anger, and therfore you ſhall reade in the Scriptures,
that God neuer ſendeth vvarre but in his vvrath, the Lord
him ſelfe ſpeaking of Ieruſalem vvhich vvas beſieged by
the enemie, ſayth: In my wrath I ſmote thee. Eſay 60, 10.
In the 2, and 3, Chapters of the Iudges, the Lord ſent and
ſet the Enemie againſt the Iſralites, many tymes: It appeareth
in thoſe places that hee neuer dyd it, but vvhen hys
vvrath or anger was kindled againſt them: Now the anger
of God is grieuous, for the Prophet ſayth of hym, that he
ſmote the people in anger vvith a continuall plague. Iſaiah
14, 6. Salomon ſayth that the Kings wrath is like the roring
of a Lyon, Pro. 19, then what is his vvrath, who is King

of Kings, thys ſhould moue vs to take thys courſe, wee ſee
when the Prince is diſpleaſed vvith hys vaſſaile, he vvill vſe
all meanes to pacifie hym, for feare hee ſhall be caſt cleane
out of fauour, ſo ſhould vve when vve perceiue the anger
of God is kinled againſt vs, ſeeke all poſsible wayes to appeaſe
hym, for feare he giue vs ouer to the luſt of our Enemyes,
and therefore let euery one of vs pray vvith Daniell,
and ſay as he dyd in the lyke caſe; O Lord according to all
thy righteruſneſſe, I beſeech thee let thyne anger and thy
wrath be turned away, Dan. 9, 16.
               3 Hys loue by the end, that father which doth chaſtiſe
his child for hys faults doth loue him, euen ſo our heauenlie
father which doth correct his children for theyr offences
doth affect them, and as the rod is a readie meanes to
brydle and reclayme chyldren from vntowardnes, ſo is
vvarre a good ſcourge to make vs remember our miſdeeds,
and ſeek to God. The Lord (ſpeaking of the Iſralites) ſaith,
in theyr affliction they vvill ſeeke me diligently, Hoſ. 5, 15,
and the Prophet Dauid ſaith: it is good for me that I haue
been afflicted for this reaſon, that I may learn thy ſtatutes,
Pſa. 119, 71. VVe ſee by experience that the child vnleſſe he
be ſometime beaten, he falleth to all vnbrideled looſeneſſe,
ſo it fareth vvith vs, if we ſhould not ſometime feele Gods
afflictions, vvee ſhould runne into all filthyneſſe, euen as
the Pſalmiſt ſaith, before I was afflicted I went aſtray. Pſal.
119, 67: Therefore let vs beare Gods puniſhment with patience,
for as gold is purified by the fire, ſo are we refined
by afflictions, and as the Bee conuerteth into honie, that
vvhich the ſpyder doth to poyſon, ſo that vvhich the enemie
doth of euill, God turneth it to our good.
               
                  In that the Enemies are Gods ſeruants
wee may note two thinges.

                        1 A Lymitation.
                        2 A Reprehenſion.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
1 A Lymitation, vve commonly ſee that Seruants are
worſe many tymes then theyr Mayſters; the Steward in
Mathew dealt well with his Seruant, but he dealt extreamlie
vvith others. Math. 18, 28: the Lord vſeth the Spaniard
as a ſpur to prouoke vs to amendment, but it may be ſayd
of hym, as of Ashur, but he thinketh not ſo, neyther doth
hys heart eſteeme it ſo, but he imagineth to deſtroy. Iſaiah,
10, 7. for he commeth with a reſolute purpoſe, to execute
his owne crueltie, and not to the ende to pleaſe God. Yet
this is our comfort, he is but Gods Seruant, and therefore
he can doe no more then God will permit &amp; appoint him,
no, though he were as bad as the deuill: for you ſee howe
ſatan could do no more to Iob then GOD ſuffered him to
doe. Iob, 1.
               2 A reprehenſion, this concerneth vs, wee are readie
to rayle and curſe the Spanyard that moleſteth vs, but in
the meane time, we do not remember he is Gods ſeruant,
which if we did, we woulde not ſo much reſpect the enimie,
as he that ſendeth him; The Spanyard no doubt banneth
and curſeth vs to the pit of hell, as we terme it, what
then, let vs forbeare him by the example of Dauid, who
being curſed of Shimei, a wicked man, hee put it vp patiently,
becauſe, (ſaith he) the Lord did bid him curſe, 2, Sa.
16, 10. If a Noble mans man abuſe vs in words, wee will
beare with him the more for his Lord and Maiſters ſake:
much more ought we to beare with the ſeruants of God;
VVe muſt not imitate euill by the example of the wicked,
though they be incited &amp; ſuffered to curſe, we haue greater
cauſe to thanke GOD if he hath giuen vs grace to refraine.
Beſides, it is but a vvindie conqueſt is got vvith
words, therefore you ſhall reade when Dauid vvas to deale
with Goliah, this Giant did curſe and ſcorne him in deriſion;
Dauid digeſted his words with ſilence, but he praied

and prepared himſelfe to incounter with him to ſome purpoſe.
Let vs follow his courſe, what though the Spaniard
doth curſe vs and ſcorne vs as Goliah dyd Dauid, let vs forbeare
him, (for wee can ſpeede neuer the better for our
ſpeeches,) but let vs like Dauid prepare our ſelues to repell
him.
            
            
               3 Wherfore Warre is ſent.
               THere are many thinke warre to be a thing of courſe,
becauſe it hath been common in all ages, whereas it
is moſt certaine, that God neuer ſendeth any croſſe
without cauſe.
               
                  The cauſe of warre is double,

                        1 Secondary.
                        2 Efficient.
                     
                  
               
               1 The Secondary cauſe is that we aſcribe to outwarde
meanes, and inſtant occaſions: as for example in other
things, if we haue any loſſe of goods, we vſe to ſay it came
by caſualtie of fire, ſhypwracke vpon the Seas, &amp;c. Or if
we get a ſicknes, we tooke it by ſuch a iourney, or of ſuch
a colde &amp;c. And ſo in this ſence we commonly ſay vvhen
we haue vvarrs, it is the malice, pryde or impietie of the
Enimy that cauſeth it. VVhen in the meane time we doe
not conſider who it is that exciteth, ſendeth, offereth or
ſuffereth ſuch motions or meanes to effect, and for what
cauſe he doth it.
               
                  2 The efficient cauſe of
warre is of two ſorts,

                        1 For Correction.
                        2 For Reformation.
                     
                  
               
               1 For Correction, as a ſcourge or puniſhment for ſin,
which the God of hoſts himſelfe affirmeth, when he ſaith,

If he ſinne I will chaſten him with the rod of men, 2, Sam,
7, 14. And the Pſalmiſt to that effect ſayth: If they break
my ſtatuts, then will I (ſpeaking in the perſon of GOD)
viſite theyr tranſgreſsions with the rod: Pſal, 89, 32. It is
written in the Chronicles, that the King of Egipt came vp
againſt Ieruſalem, becauſe they had tranſgreſſed againſt
the Lord: 2, Chro, 12, 2, and ſo if the Spaniard commeth
againſt vs, we muſt perſwade our ſelues that our ſinnes are
the chiefe cauſe of it.
               But whether God ſendeth warre to vs for our ingratitude,
for our laſt deliuery from the Spaniard, as he dyd to
Hezekiah for his vnthankfulneſſe when he was deliuered
from Senacherib, 2, Chron, 32, 25, or whether it be for our
oppreſsion and cruelty, as hee did to the Iſraelites for the
like ſinnes, Ierem, 6, 6, or whether it be for any groſſe ſins
amongſt vs, as he did to the Babilonians for theyr barbarous
beaſtlines, Eſay 13, or whether it be for our murmuring
at this Scarcitie, or for the hardnes of our harts to the
poore in this extreame time, God knowes; ſome grieuous
ſinnes there be that prouoke the Lord, for elſe he would
not viſite vs, two yeares together vvith Scarcitie, and the
third yeare threaten vs with warre.
               2 For Reformation, that warre is ſent to reforme and
amend vs is manifeſt; Behold, famine, plague, anguiſh &amp;
trouble, are ſent as ſcourges for amendement: 2, Eſd, 16, 15.
The father doth chaſtiſe his ſonne, not becauſe he taketh
pleaſure in puniſhing of him, but that he may by it brydle
and amend him; Euen ſo GOD the Father correcteth vs
which be his children, not becauſe hee delighteth in puniſhment,
but to the end he may therby reclaym vs frō our
iniquities. As the rod of wood is a meane to make the vntoward
childe gracious, ſo is the rod of warre an inſtigation
to mooue vs to good: as it is ſaide of Iudah, Lorde in

trouble haue they viſited thee, they poured out a prayer
when thy chaſtening vvas open them; Eſay, 26, 16. And
therfore God dealeth with vs as a Phiſitian: A good Phiſitian
will ceaſe from miniſtring phiſick to his patient whē
he is recouered; or as a Maiſter, who will ſtay from ſtryking
his ſeruant when he is growne better by his beating.
So God, he deſiſteth his puniſhments ſo ſoone as wee are
profited by them. I will recite one example in ſteed of many,
the Lord raiſed vp Shiſshake to ſcourge Rehoboam for
his ſinne, but the text ſayth, Becauſe he humbled himſelfe
the wrath of the Lord turned from him; 2, Chro, 12, 12.
               
                  From the matter precedent
wee may obſerue two things,

                        1 A grieuous cominatiō.
                        2 A notable conſolation.
                     
                  
               
               1 A grieuous comination, by the correction if wee repent
not: for if we perſeuere in our ſins, what foloweth?
               
                  Puniſhments

                        Temporall.
                        Eternall.
                     
                  
               
               Temporall puniſhments: for the Lord ſayth to ſuch, I
will ſet my face againſt you, and yee ſhall fall before your enimies,
and they that hate you ſhall raigne ouer you. Leu.
26, 17. Let vs make this caſe our own: what a heauy iudgment
were this, if the Lord (for our committing and continuing
in ſinne) ſhould frowne vpon vs when the Spaniard
commeth with his force againſt vs, &amp; ſhould ſuffer him
to preuaile as the Medes &amp; Perſians did in Babilon, would
he not deale as they did, of whom it is ſaid: their chyldren
ſhall be broken in peeces before theyr eyes, theyr houſes
ſhall be ſpoyled, and theyr wiues rauiſhed, Eſay, 13, 16.
               
                  
VVere not this a lamentable ſight to beholde, and to haue
him to raigne ouer vs that hateth vs what a miſerable bondage
were it? vvho would not think but that this puniſhment
were grieuous and ſufficient: but if we ſtil perſeuere,
the Lord wil ſtil purſue vs, for he ſaith; If yee will not for
theſe things obey me, then will I puniſh you ſeauen times
more, according to your ſinnes; Leuit, 26. As we ſee hee
delt by Pharaoh, he neuer left of his plagues ſo long as hee
liued impenitent; Thys may teach vs howe grieuous a
thing ſinne is with perſeuerance.
               Eternall puniſhments, the temporall plagues are but an
enterance to theſe. Hoc ſuſpicari &amp;c. ſayth Gregory, a man
cannot ſuſpect howe extreame thoſe paynes are. Such as
perſeuere in wickednes, let them remember what Paule
ſayth, They doe but heape vp wrath againſt the day of
iudgement, Rom, 2, 5. As D. Martir ſayth vvel vpon that
place, a hard hart is that which wil not be mollified with
Gods benefits, woon with hys mercyes, broke with hys
threatnings, nor reclaymed with his puniſhments.
               The Heathen men had thys naturall fore-ſight for the
reſtraint of ſinne; The Lidians would haue in theyr houſes
the picture of a deuill in forme of an Ethiopian, that by
the horrible ſight, they might abhor that which brought
him to it, which was ſinne. The Perſians would paynt an
Epicure diſguiſed with exceſſe, that theyr chyldren might
auoyde the like fault, by ſeeing that deformitie. The Lacedemonians
would ſhew theyr youths drunken and deſperat
men, that they might be deterred from ſinne, by the
lothſomnes of that ſight; If Chriſtian men, would ſet before
them the horror of hell, it would make them feareful
to practiſe euill, much more to perſeuere in it. For thys
cauſe Chryſoſtome willeth vs to talke often of hell, that wee
may take heede of it.
               
                  
2 A notable Conſolation, by the Reformation, if wee
take profit by this puniſhment, in reforming our lyues and
lyuing in the feare of God. The Spaniarde may perhaps
feare-blaſt vs with his Armie, but he ſhall neuer preuaile in
his attempt; for the Lord ſaith of ſuch: the Sworde ſhall
not goe through your Land, yee ſhall chaſe your enimies,
and they ſhall fall before you vpon the ſword. Leuit, 26.
Although the Lord hath prepared the Spaniard to come
againſt vs, and had pronounced to puniſh vs, yet his penall
promiſes are but conditionall, for if we repent, he repenteth;
(If (ſaith hee) this Nation againſt whom I haue
pronounced, turne from theyr wickednes, I will repent of
the plague that I thought to bring vpon them, Ierem, 18, 8,
therefore let vs all pray for the grace of repentance, and
labour to ſhew forth the fruites of it.
               Such as haue oppreſſed and bitten their bretheren with
extreame bargaines theſe hard yeeres, let them make ſome
amends; The Ethnicks required double reſtitution, Zaccheus
made foure-fold reſtitution, Luke, 19. Salamon telleth
vs of a ſeauen-fold reſtitution, Prou, 6, and therefore
they may do little if they make not ſome reſtitution. Such
as haue carried theyr heads as hie as Lucifer, let them now
holde downe their heads like Bulruſhes. Such as haue
ground the faces of the poore, let them doe good to them
thys time of Scarcetie, not onely for commandement ſake,
as Sirach ſayth, Ecclus, 37, but euen for pollicie ſake: for
you know what Salomon ſayth: In the multitude of the
people is the honour of a King, but for the want of people
commeth the deſtruction of the Prince, Prou, 14, 28. If
God ſhould ſend the enemie againſt vs, the moſt defencible
ſtrength of the Land conſiſteth in the poore, for they
are ſubiect to moſt ſeruice and greateſt dangers; VVee ſee
thys hard ſeaſon that the poore begin to pine alreadie, becauſe

they want the ſtay and ſtaffe of theyr ſtrength, which
is bread; Now, if we would haue them to fight for vs, let
vs not ſee them famiſh; if we would haue them forcibly to
vſe theyr weapons, let vs not infeeble them for want of
victuals; If we would haue them ſtrong, let vs not ſtarue
them. How can a ſouldier bee hardie againſt the enemie,
when his hart is killed for want of ſuccour? therefore if
we loue our Prince, let vs labour to preſerue the honor of
our Prince, let vs not ſuffer the multitude of her people to
perriſh for want of ſuſtenance, leaſt if the Spaniarde happen
to come, wee haue miſſe of thoſe men to defend vs,
which for want of our foode did famiſh.
               Generally, ſeeing all ſinne is odious, and the naming of
it tedious, let euery one of vs amend one: ſo by our true
contrition, we ſhall pacifie the Lord, and cauſe him to appeaſe
the furie of our foes.
               
                  1 How to debilitate and repell the
Enemie.
                  
                     The meanes which
we muſt vſe, are two

                           1 Diuine,
                           2 Humaine.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     The diuine meanes be theſe

                           Inuocation,
                           Abſtinence.
                        
                     
                  
                  INuocation, as a learned vvryter ſayth, is that vvhereby
we flye vnto God in all perils and aduerſities, with an
aſſured confidence that he is able to ſuccour and defend
vs, D. Martir in Com. Ro. cap. 1. This inuocation or prayer
we ought to practiſe as a thing moſt precious. Firſt, becauſe

it is the forme to frame al our requeſts by: let your requeſts
be ſhewed vnto God by praier, Phil. 4, 6. Secondly,
becauſe we are willed to vſe it in our diſtreſſe for eaſe. Call
vpon me in the time of trouble, &amp; I wil heare thee. Pſal. 50,
15. Thirdly, becauſe it effecteth many things. Moſes did
more good in lyfting vp his handes, then the Iſraelites dyd
with theyr weapons, for when he did let down his hands,
the Amalekites preuayled. Exod. 17, 11. Fourthly, becauſe
he wee call vpon is the God of Hoſtes, and therefore vve
haue many reaſons to moue vs to pray to him: for firſt, he
muſt prepare our hearts therevnto, or elſe we cannot pray.
VVe cannot thinke a good thought, 2, Cor. 3: neyther
ſay that Ieſus is the Lord, 1, Cor. 12, 3. Then much leſſe
can vve pray vvithout hym. Secondly, his power is infallible,
and therefore he is ſuch an one as we may ſtay vpon.
Abiah got the victory of Iehoram, not vvith worldly power,
but the text ſayth, Iudah preuayled, becauſe they ſtaid
vpon the Lord God, of their fathers, 2, Chro. 13, 18. Heerof
Dauid ſayth, bleſſed is the man that maketh the Lord
hys truſt. Pſal. 40, 4, 3. Hys prouydence is vigilant, and
therefore is alvvayes readie at hand to helpe, the Lord is
neere vnto all that call vpon hym, ſayth the Pſalmiſt, Pſ.
145, 18. He maketh vs pertakers of his eſſentiall preſence.
VVhen Iehoshaphat was to fight againſt his enemies, what
a comfort vvas this to him, when he heard, the Lord will
be vvith you, 2, Chro. 20, 17, and fight for you, as he did
for Iſrael. Ioſh. 10, 14. Fourthly, without hym wee can
do nothing, and therefore we haue neede to pray to him.
The Horſe is prepared againſt the day of battell, but ſaluation
is of the Lord. Pro. 21, 31. There is no hope of proſperous
ſucceſſe, if the Lord ſayth the Enemie ſhall gather
hym ſelfe but vvithout me, Eſay 54, 15: whereas if he be
with vs, vve are aſſured none can be againſt vs or hurt vs,

2, Chro. 18, 31.
                  Thys prayer or inuocation is ſo heauenly a medecine
for humaine malydies, that our fore-fathers dyd flye vnto
it, as a refuge, vvhen theyr enemies afflicted them. Nowe
becauſe we may haue the lyke occaſion of trouble as they
had, it ſhall not be impertinent to expreſſe ſome of theyr
zealous prayers, for vs to practiſe in the like extreamitie.
                  
                     Examples and formes of godly prayers,
vſed in vvarres.
                     WHen the Ethiopians came to vvarre againſt Aſa,
that godly King, the text ſaith that he cried vnto
the Lord his God and ſayd:
                     Lord it is nothing with thee to helpe with many,
or vvith no power, helpe vs ô Lord our God: for
we reſt on thee, and in thy name are vvee come againſt
thys multitude, ô Lord thou art our God, let
not man preuayle againſt thee, 2, Chro. 14, 11.
                     The Lord heard hys prayer, for it followeth in theſe
words. So the Lord ſmote the Ethiopians before Aſa.
                     
                     VVhen the Aſsirians came to aſſault Iſrael, the Scripture
ſayth that Hezekiah prayed before the Lord and ſayd:
                     
                        O Lord God of Iſrael, vvhich dwelleſt betweene
the Cherubins, thou art very God alone, ouer all
the kingdomes of the earth, thou haſt made the
heauen and the earth, nowe therefore ô Lord our
God, I beſeech thee ſaue thou vs out of hys hand,
that all the kingdomes of the earth may know, that
thou ô Lord art onely God, 
                        2, Kings 19.
                     
                     His prayer preuailed with the Lord: for it is there written,
I haue heard that vvhich thou prayedſt me, verſe 20.

VVhen the Moabites and Ammonites dyd war againſt
Iehoshaphat, that vertuous King, he prayed vnto the Lord
and ſayd:
                     
                        O our God, vvilt thou not iudge them: for there is
no ſtrength in vs, to ſtand before this great multitude
that commeth againſt vs, neither do we know
vvhat to doo: but our eyes are toward thee, 
                        2,
Chro. 20, 12.
                     
                     Hys prayer had good ſucceſſe: for hee ouer-threw all
hys Enemyes.
                     VVhen Lyſias came vvith a multitude of men againſt
Iudas, when he ſaw that mighty Army, he praied and ſaid.
                     
                        O Lord ſhut vp this Armie, in the hand of thy people,
and let them be confounded, with theyr power,
make them afrayd and conſume theyr boldneſſe and
ſtrength, that they may bee aſtoniſhed at theyr deſtruction.
Caſt them downe by the ſword of them
that loue thee, then ſhall all they that know thy name
prayſe thee, 
                        1, Macch. 4, 31.
                     
                     Hys prayer was not neglected of the Lord: for he ſlew
many of the hoſt of his Enemie.
                     Let vs follow thys courſe, when the Spanyards come againſt
vs, and we ſhall receiue the like comfort, their prayers
were pithie and ſhort, vvithout vayne babling, lyke the
Heathen, or ambition lyke the Phariſies, but the profite
which came of theyr peticions vvere vnſpeakeable.
                     In the time of the olde lawe, it vvas not onely a trouble
but a charge, to offer ſacrifice to God; for there vvas killing
and offering of Bullockes, Calues, Sheepe, &amp;c. But
now the Lord requireth nothing of vs, but the calues of
our lips, as Hoſea ſpeaketh on, Hoſ. 14, 3, or the fruite of
the lips, as the Author of the Hebrewes ſayth, Cap. 13, 15.
Therefore we may do little if we will not afford our lips to

pray vnto God, ſo it proceedeth from the hart, otherwiſe
as Auguſtine ſayth, Oratio ſine deuotione eſt quaſi mugitus bouis.
Prayer vvithout deuotion is as the lowing of an Oxe. But
if it be ſincere, then as Caluine ſayth, it is an honourable
ſacrifice to God. Cal. cap. 4, 1. Epiſt. ad Timotheum.
                     
                     Abſtinance is the ſecond diuine meane to vſe, I do not
note thys, as a diſtinct action by it ſelfe, but as a neceſſarie
appendant to accompanie prayer: for although prayer is
bettered by faſting, yet faſting is of no force without prayer,
therefore in the Scriptures they commonly concur together,
Luke 2, 36.
                     Our fore-fathers vvould vnite faſting and prayer together
in all their afflictions, eyther priuatlie with theyr families,
as Daniell dyd, Cap. 9, 3. and Dauid dyd, 2, Sam. 1,
12, vvhen it ſpecially concerned them ſelues; or elſe publiquelie,
when it generallie toucht a vvhole land: as vvee
reade of Iehoshaphat, how hee proclaymed a faſt through
all hys dominions, vvhen the Enemies dyd threaten the
ſword, 2, Chro. 20. whoſe example vvee ought to immitate,
becauſe he was a godly Prince.
                     
                        This Faſting ſerueth
for a double vſe

                              1 To fortifie the Spyrit.
                              2 To mortifie the fleſh.
                           
                        
                     
                     1 To fortifie the Spirit, for by faſting the Spirite hath a
more free paſſage vnto prayer: the reaſon is, becauſe the
ſences beeing filled, are inclined to ſluggiſhnes, according
to the old ſaying: Impletus venter quarit dormire libentur.
Therefore we ſhal read how Dauid in many of his pſalmes
ſaith; Early or betimes in the morning will I direct my
prayer vnto thee ô Lord: becauſe his prayer was moſt feruent
when he was faſting; wherby wee may ſee that corporall
emptines is a furtherance to ſpirituall exerciſes.
                     
                        
2 To mortifie the fleſh from ſinning; the ground the
more it is manured, it bringeth forth more weedes, ſo the
fleſh, the more it is pampered, it is the more pron
                           •
                         to wickednes:
and therfore as the ſtrongeſt Caſtle is ſoone taken
if the ſouldiers want ſuſtenaunce, ſo the raging luſtes are
ſoone ſubdued if the fleſh be not foſtered. For thys cauſe
the Pſalmiſt ſayth: I humbled my ſoule with faſting, Pſal.
35, 13, which is the onely fruite of faſting. Therefore as
Bernard ſayth: Si oculus offendit, ieiunat oculus: if the eye offend,
let it faſt: that is if it hath beene before inclined to
wanton lookes, (as Dauids was when hee beheld Berſaba)
let it now refraine; and ſo in the reſt of the members, as
they haue done amiſſe to let them amend; For true faſting
(as Baſil ſaith) requireth a ſuppreſsing of anger, and cutting
of carnall concupiſcence; And then as Ierome ſayth, is faſting
moſt excellent to GOD, Cum aliquis ieiunat a vitiis,
when any doth faſt or refraine from ſinne.
                     The Hypocrite, he will faſt for vaine-glory, the Couetous
man to ſpare expence; the Glutton to get him a ſtomack:
but let vs faſt to crucifie the luſts of the fleſh, to mitigate
ſinne. If Eue had faſted from the tree, we neede not
thys faſt, ſaith Baſil. VVe haue many reaſons to reſtraine vs
from ſinne, but by the imminent occaſion, if the Spaniard
happen to approch, we haue 2. ſpeciall reaſons to refraine
from euill at that inſtant. Firſt, our principall ſtrength cō
                        ſiſteth
in God, and therefore wee muſt ſue and ſeeke vnto
hym by prayer. Now, if we will gladly obtaine that wee
aske, we muſt willingly abſtaine from that hee abhorreth.
Let euery one that call vpon GOD, depart from iniquitie
ſayth Paul, 2, Tim, 2, 19. ſo that there is nothing can hinder
our ſute but ſin. Secondly, if we deſire good ſucceſſe
againſt the Enimy, if it happen otherwiſe, we may impute
it to our ſin. VVhen Ioſua ſent men to beſiege Ai, ſome of

them were ſlaine by the enemie, and the reſt that returned
were diſcomforted, only for the ſin of one man. Ioſu, 7, 12.
The Lorde neuer ſuffered the enimies to preuaile againſt
the Iſralites in time of war, but when they had committed
ſome notable ſins: Iudg, 3, 12. And if any thing falleth out
otherwiſe then wel amongſt vs by the Spaniard, wee muſt
think we haue ſome grieuous ſinns that cauſe it, or els you
ſhall reade in the ſcriptures, that the godly (which ſerued
the true God as we do) had ſeldome or neuer any bad
ſucceſſe in their battels when they were beſet with theyr
enemies, but by occaſion of ſome heynous actions: and
therefore it was not without cauſe that Moſes made thys
lawe or exhortation for ſouldiers; VVhen thou goeſt out
with the Hoſt againſt thine enimies, keepe thee then from
all wickednes. Deut, 23, 9.
                     
                        2 The Humaine meanes be theſe

                              Politicall,
                              Inſtrumentall,
                              Patheticall.
                           
                        
                     
                     The politicall meanes belong ſpecially to the Prince and
high powers, for good conſideration &amp; conſultation to be
taken in ſo weighty an attempt. VVhen Hezekiah ſaw that
Senacherib purpoſed to fight againſt his country, thē (ſaith
the text) he tooke counſel with his Princes &amp; his Nobles,
2, Chro, 32, 3. For as Salomon ſaith, VVhere no counſell is,
the people fal, but where many Counſellers are, there is
health, Prou. 11, 14. The Parable in Luke fitlie aludeth to
thys purpoſe, vvhere it is ſayd, vvhat King going to make
warre againſt an other King, ſitteth not down firſt and taketh
counſell, whether he be able with tenne thouſand to
meet him that commeth againſt him with twentie thouſand,
Luke 14, 31. Ioſua at the firſt tooke a foyle of the men
of Ai, becauſe hee ſent not aboue 3000. men: but afterward,
well conſulting of the matter, and ſeeing the enimy

ſo ſtrong, he ſent aboue thirty thouſand men, and then he
vanquiſhed them, Ioſu, 7, &amp; 8. It was not amiſſe ſpoken by
a wicked King, that counſel and ſtrength are for the vvar,
2, Kings 18, 20, for power little preuaileth without counſell,
or proweſſe without policie; for what weighty exployts
haue been atchiued abrode, but by good aduiſe at
home? the ouerthrowe of Carthage was wrought by the
aduiſe of Cato a Counſeller; Iericho was beſieged of the
Iewes by the wholſome counſel of Ioſua, Ioſ, 6. Diuers other
examples there be in the Scriptures to thys purpoſe,
but I will omit them; all that I will add is thys, ſeeing God
ſtandeth in the congregation of the Gods, as the Pſalmiſt
ſayth, I beſeech him ſo to ſanctifie theyr counſels, as it may
turne to our good, and his glory.
                     The inſtrumentall meane, as men and munition, muſt
not be neglected, although God can deſtroy the enimy immediatly,
as he did the hoſt of Senacherib, or miraculouſlie,
as he did Iericho by the meanes of Rams hornes: and the
Moabites by dazeling theyr ſight with the ſun-ſhine vpon
the water, 2, Reg, 3, 22, and Pharaoh and his hoſt by the red
Sea; yet we muſt vſe the lawfull &amp; ordinary courſe of defence;
for God doth not now ſtrike immediatly, or ſo miraculouſly,
but by meanes, to the end we ſhould not contemne
the meanes, or altogether depend vpon the means,
Eſay, 31, 1, but to vſe and commende the meanes to Gods
bleſsing, who can giue good ſucceſſe, be the meanes neuer
ſo ſimple.
                     The patheticall meanes are to bee vſed by ſuch as haue
the regiment or conduct of ſouldiers, to encourage and
comfort them, for fleſh and blood is fearefull. The beſt
VVarriors of al wil ſomtime be abaſhed, and therefore no
meruaile though the common ſort be ſomwhat timorous.
For this cauſe we find diuers inſtances in the ſcriptures, of

Generals, Captaines, and worthy warriors, who haue vſed
very pathetical and moouing ſpeeches, to comfort and incourage
theyr companies in war.
                     It is ſayd of Hezekiah, that he ſpake comfortablie to hys
people, when the Aſsirians intended to aſſault hym, hys
wordes are theſe: Bee ſtrong and couragious, feare not,
neyther be afrayd, for the King of Aſhur, neyther for all
the multitude that is with hym: for there be more with
vs then with hym; vvith hym is an arme of fleſh, but with
vs is the Lord our God for to helpe vs, and to fight our
battayles, 2, Chro. 32, 7, 8. The people hearing theſe
comfortable ſpeeches (although before they vvere ſomewhat
afrighted) the next ſayth, then the people vvere confirmed,
by the words of Hezekiah. Ioab was a valiant Captayne
vnder Dauid, and he comforted hys Souldiers in this
ſort: Be ſtrong, &amp; let vs be valiant for our people, and for
the Citties of our God, and let the Lord doo that vvhich is
good in his eyes, 2, Sam. 10, 12. Albeit Ioab was otherwiſe
in hys lyfe, a bloodie man, not onely in vvarre, but in time
of peace, 1, Kings 2, 5, yet who could vſe a more com-mouing
kind of ſpeech, to comfort and incourage hys Souldiers
then this? inſomuch as they all ioyned together ioyfullie,
and put the enemie to flyght. The lyke courſe did
Simon and Maccabeus, two notable vvarriors vſe with their
Souldiers, vvho being terrified with the view of mightie
Armies, and other martiall accidents, by theyr apt perſwaſions,
they proued valorous, where before they vvere timorous,
and in the end diſcomfited theyr Enemies, as you
may reade at large in 1, Macch. 3, and 2, Mach. 8.
                     The moſt renowned and valianteſt vvarriors amongſt
the Heathen, as Caeſar, Alexander, &amp;c, vvould neuer goe
into the field without Phyloſophers (who in theyr tymes
were deemed the onelie vviſe men) to the end they might

inſtruct and comfort theyr Souldiers. It is none of the
leaſt poyntes of martiall diſcipline, to practiſe all poſsible
and perſwaſiue meanes, to incourage, comfort, and corroborat
the hartes of the Souldiers; for moſt men deſire to
ſerue vnder ſuch a Captayne. VVhen the Iewes heard the
comfortable vvordes of Simon, they were ſo inclined and
affected to hym, that they forth-with burſt out of theſe
words in a clamorous manner. Thou ſhalt be our Captayne
in ſteede of Iudas, 1, Mach. 13, 8, and wee reade of
Dauid, how he did ſo win the harts of hys Souldiers, that
the people more affected and famozed hym then Saul; and
yet Iudas and Saul vvere two valiant vvarriors. There is
nothing more delighteth and draweth lyking in vvarre,
then lenitie, and louing perſwaſions, vvhereas raſh and rigorous
dealing, doth more hurt in the harts of the Souldiers,
then in the hoſt of the Enemie.
                  
               
               
                  2 How to corroborate and comfort our
ſelues againſt the Spanyard.
                  
                     In all warres wee muſt
conſider three things.

                           1 The cauſe,
                           2 The perſons,
                           3 The end.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     1 The cauſe that moueth
the Enemie, whether it be

                           Iuſt,
                           Iniurious.
                        
                     
                  
                  IVſt warre is that which is taken in hande at the commaundement
of the Magiſtrate, for the demaunding of
things againe, or to repulſe iniuries, or to reuenge them.
Auguſtine, and Iſidorus, define it much after thys manner.
No man doubteth, but that the Magiſtrate is to command:
for he beareth not the ſword for nought, therefore Poſsidonius
                     
in the life of Auguſtine, ſayth, that he in his writings
would neuer commend thoſe, vvhich went to warre in
any place, of theyr owne accord, Poſſ. cap. 27. The demaunding
of things agayne, moued Abraham to attempt
warre, becauſe the enemies had taken away hys brother,
and other mens ſubſtance, Gen. 14, 14. To repulſe iniuries,
vvas the chiefe cauſe, that moued all godlie Kings in
the Scriptures to vndertake warre, for the deſence of their
dominions, liues, and religion. The reuenging of iniurie
was Dauids caſe, whoſe men beeing abuſed by Hanun, to
whom hee offered kindneſſe, thys iniurie cauſed hym to
make vvarre againſt hym, to requite hys inhumanitie, 2,
Sam. 10, 7. Now let vs come to applie thys to the Spanyard,
we deteine nothing of hys, that he can iuſtly demand,
or proffer hym iniurie, that he may rightlie ſeeke reuenge,
therefore hys cauſe is not iuſt. Iniurious vvarre is that
which is attempted of malyce, as Saul dyd againſt Dauid,
2, Sam, 18, 9. Or of pryde or ſuch like impious occaſions,
it is this that dooth prouoke the Spaniard in ſpyte to come
againſt vs; therefore his cauſe is iniurious, for as Hoſtienſis
ſayth, He doth ill that taketh war in hand of will, and not
of neceſsity.
                  
                     VVhere there is iniury, we
muſt obſerue, whether it be

                           Offered,
                           Defended.
                        
                     
                  
                  If it be offered, his offence is grieuous that doth it: for
the ſcripture ſaith, woe be to him that giueth the offence.
                  If it be defended, hee doth not ſin that ſuffereth the iniury;
beſides, as D. Martir ſayth, a Chriſtian is not forbid
but that he may repell violence by violence, in com. Ro. 12.
                  The Spanyard he offereth iniury, wee defend it, hee aſſaulteth
vs, we withſtand him, he vrgeth war voluntarily,

we are prouoked of neceſsity; hee ſinneth in offering iniury,
and not we in defending it, ſo our mindes incline to
peace, though our bodyes are conſtrayned to war, therefore
thys is our comfort, if the Spaniard commeth, hys
cauſe is not iuſt but iniurious, vvhich may make vs the
more bold to buckle with him, and hope to haue the better
ſucceſſe, becauſe his violence is voluntary, ours, impulſatory.
                  
                     2 The perſons that make warre are
to be regarded, whether they bee

                           Prophane,
                           Godly.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     The Spaniard is a prophane
perſon two wayes,

                           In Life.
                           In Religion.
                        
                     
                  
                  In his life I will note but two things, firſt his pride, ſecondly,
his crueltie. His inſolence is well knowne to the
world, inſomuch as that report of Moab may be applied to
him, which is written in Eſay 15. VVee haue heard of the
pryde of Moab, he is very proude: and therefore vnleſſe
God be merciful to him, hee may in the ſomtome of hys
pryde come to as miſerable an end as Moab. Hys crueltie
is intollerable where he doth tyrannize, for he is far worſe
then Nero. Nero for all his cruelty, when hee was to ſubſcribe
to a ſentence of death, would wiſh hee could not
write, but the Spaniard, he careth no more to ſhed blood
then the Butcher, and therefore in his enterprize hee may
be fearefull by the example of Pharaoh, who carrying ſo
murderous a minde, by deſtroying chyldren in the water,
that in the warre where he thought to worke his will, he
was drowned himſelfe by water; let him take heed, leaſt
the Lord doth make him ſhed teares without mercy, as he
hath ſhed blood without meaſure.
                  In religion, the Spaniard is like the Leopard, ful of ſpots;

A ſpottiſh and ſottiſh profeſsion is that which derogateth
the glory of God, for the whole action of idolatry, &amp; the
ſubſtance of ſuperſtition is common in his Country; ſuch
crouching to croſſes in the ſtreets, ſuch adoration of Images
in the Churches, ſuch mumbling of Maſſes, Diriges,
Trentals, and ſuch like trumperies, which would make a
good Chriſtian lament to looke vpon, which they delight
to practiſe and depend vpon. Hee is worſe then Pharaoh,
for he made much of Ioſeph, becauſe hee was a good man,
but he can neither abide the perſon or profeſsion of a godly
man. He is worſe then the Turke, for he wil not refuſe
to receiue the Bible, much leſſe perſecute ſuch as preſent
it to him; but the Spaniard is ſo great an enemie to God,
that he doth impriſon the bodyes, confiſcate the goods, &amp;
inflict other puniſhments vpon ſuch as bring but a godlie
booke into hys Country; inſomuch as there appeares to
be no ſparke of godlines in him: becauſe he reiecteth the
meanes that might effect ſome good in him.
                  Sithence the Spaniard is but a prophane perſon, let vs
diſcend to examples for our comfort, and we ſhal ſee from
time to time, how the wicked in theyr warres againſt the
godly, haue alwayes got repulſe &amp; ouerthrow in the end.
That wicked Pharaoh which long troubled and tyrannized
ouer the good Iſraelites, in his laſt aſſault of warre againſt
them, he was ſo far from effecting his furie, that the
Lord drowned him &amp; all his hoſt vpon the red Sea. VVell
woorthy was hee to be drowned in the water, who had
cauſed many chyldren to be caſt into the Riuer, Exo, 1, 22.
That blaſphemous Senacherib, who diſturbed Hezekiah a
godly king, in the end the Lorde did puniſh him, not mediatly,
but immediatly, by ſending his Angell into his
Camp, who ſmote many thouſands of his men; and as for
Senacharib himſelfe, as hee had dealt vnnaturally againſt

God, ſo he was not long after vnnaturally put to death of
his owne chyldren.
                  That peruerſe generation of the Moabites &amp; Amonits,
made warre againſt that vertuous King Iehoshaphat, they
vvere ſo far from preuailing, that GOD made one enemy
to be executioner to another; 2, Chro, 17.
                  That irreligious Ethiopian which moleſted Aſa, that
tovvard plant and Prince, at the laſt hee did not onely put
the Ethiopian to flight with a fevve, but alſo got him by
purſute, and had his will of him. 2, Chro, 14.
                  Similitude and example, doth much moue ſaith Cicero,
for vvho cannot be cōforted by ſo godly examples. Quitilian
ſayth, that hiſtories and examples be iudgements and
teſtimonies; for who cannot beholde the iudgements of
GOD by theſe examples? Auguſtine ſaith, that examples
ought to be as Sermons to vs: for as godly Sermons doe
miniſter matter for our edification, and conſolation, ſo doe
theſe examples in thys ſort.
                  Firſt, we may learne from hence, howe the godlie are
ſubiect to many ſorrowes, as Dauid ſayth: The troubles of
the righteous are many, Pſa, 34, 19, for there are euer ſome
ambitious and rebellious kinde of people that ſtir vp ſtrife
and ſedition againſt them, therefore wee muſt not thinke
much though the Spaniard ſet himſelfe againſt vs.
                  Secondly, we may ſee from hence, although God doth
ſuffer the wicked to aſſault and diſturbe the godly, yet hee
vvill not ſuffer the enemy to preuaile: therfore this is our
comfort, ſo long as wee feare God and liue in ſome meaſure
anſwerable to it, the Spaniard may well come, but he
ſhall neuer accompliſh his will.
                  Thirdly, wee may behold by theſe examples, that albeit
God doth vſe the wicked as his inſtruments or ſeruaunts,
yet he dooth not affect any euill, or fauoureth theyr malitious

intents. He affecteth no ill, becauſe in the ende hee
afflicteth ſuch as commit it: Prou, 24, 20. He doth not fauour
theyr malicious intents, becauſe hee gyueth thē bad
ſucceſſe in theyr attempts.
                  3 The End, which ought to be aymed at in VVar, is
not victory but peace: for as Chriſtians would neuer vvar
if they might poſſeſſe peace, ſo when they be conſtrayned
to warre, they deſire peace; as Dauid ſayth of his enemies,
I ſeeke peace, and when I ſpeake thereof, they are bent to
vvarre, Pſalme, 120, 7. Thys contradicteth Ariſtotle, who
concludeth, that as the end of phiſicke is health, ſo the end
of vvarre is victory.
                  But let vs diſcend to the Spaniard, to ſee what end hee
aymeth at; he commeth not hether to enrich vs with his
Indian treaſure, or to ſupply vs with his Spaniſh warres, or
to make amends for his proffered iniuries, or to offer conditions
of peace, but the end of his comming is eſpecially,
                  
                     for theſe three cauſes,

                           1 To attempt VVarre.
                           2 To inuade the Land.
                           3 To deſtroy vs.
                        
                     
                  
                  1 To attempt warre: for it may be ſayd of hym, as of
Aſshur, vpon vvhom hath not his malyce paſt continually.
Nah. 3, 19. For he warreth and diſquieteth many Nations,
as he loueth, ſo he laboureth to ſhed blood: Yet in thys
action, he ſhowes a baſe minde, for all he is ſo ambitious a
man, vve commonly ſay he is no man that vvill fight with
a woman: for if he doth vanquiſh, he can haue no great
glory, if he be ouerthrown, he taketh great ſhame; There
is a pretie inſtance for thys purpoſe in Abimelech, who being
about to ſet a Tower on fire, a woman caſt a peece of
milſtone vpon his head, and broke hys brayne-pan; Abimelech
called haſtelie for hys Page, and bad hym drawe his

ſword to ſlay hym, that men might not ſay of hym, a vvoman
ſlewe hym, Iudg, 9, 54. If the Spanyard dyd beare
the minde of a man, he would neuer moleſt a woman, a
Virgine, a Queene, whoſe lyfe and religion is a light to all
the world, vvhoſe diſpoſition and dayes requier quiet, but
as God brought Syſera that wicked perſon to death, by the
hand of Iael a woman, Iudg. 4, 22, and Olifernes to deſtruction,
by the hand of Iudith a woman, and Abimelech,
to hys ende, as you haue heard by a woman, ſo his mercy,
can make her Maieſtie powerful, by ſome meanes or other,
to ſpoyle the Spanyard; hee vvhich hath deliuered her
from ſo many ſecret villanies at home, vvill protect her
from the open violence of her Enemies abroad.
                  2 To Inuade the land: hys meaning is not to view it,
but to inuade it, he carryeth a reſolute intent to enter, before
he knowes the iſſue: for in hys laſt vyage he made hether,
he preſumed of a conceited conqueſt, and bewrayed
hys ſiniſter pretence, before he was aſſured of his purpoſe.
The Iewes dyd not caſt lots for Chriſtes garments, tyll he
was crucified, but the Spanyard and hys company did caſt
dyce for our lyuings, before they had tryed the euent.
                  3 To deſtroy vs, thys was one commendation Cicero
gaue Caeſar, that when he had vanquiſhed, hee would be
mercifull and forget iniuries, Alexander that magnanimious
minded vvarrior, when he might haue hys will of hys
Enemyes, would ſay it ſuffized hym to tryumph, though
he dyd not tyrannize. If heathen men were ſo inclyned to
mercie, much more ought Chriſtians, the very law of arms
affordeth mercy to ſuch as be ſubmiſsiue, but what fauour
is to be expected of hym, whoſe affections be not ſeaſoned
with the feare of God? The Spaniard pretendeth to England,
as Pharaoh dyd to Iſrael, when he ſayd, I will deuide
the ſpoyle, my luſt ſhalbe ſatisfied vpon them, I will drawe

my ſword, myne hand ſhall deſtroy them. Exod. 15, 9.
God deliuer vs from hys malyce, we may not truſt to hys
mercie: for as the ground dyd fare the vvorſe for Abimelech,
becauſe it was fruitfull, ſo ſhall we by the Spanyard,
becauſe of our profeſsion: He made the ground barren by
ſowing of ſalte, Iudg. 9, 45, thys, hopes to hynder the
growth of the word by ſhedding of blood, the truth is, he
would take away our liues, to roote out our religion; but
as Salomon ſayth: He that deſpiſeth the word, he ſhall be
deſtroyed, Pro. 13, 13. So thys is our comfort, God will
take our cauſe in hand: for as Iehoshaphat ſayd, ſo may we.
It is Gods battell and not our, 2, Chro. 20. Hee will not
permit ſuch to preuayle, which haue any pretence to impayre
hys glorie.
               
               
                  3 The moſt fearefull obiections confuted,
which make againſt vs.
                  
                     There be two things which
make vs doubt the vvorſt,

                           1 The power of the enimie,
                           2 Some ſiniſter ciuil practiſe
                        
                     
                  
                  1 THE power of the Enemie, without queſtion is
great, it may be he ſhall haue the ayd of the Indians,
the aſiſtance of the Pope, and perhaps
the helpe of ſuch as haue greater cauſe to gratifie vs, then
be againſt vs. Alas good England, thou art incloſed in a
corner of the world, many are thy Enemies, becauſe God
is thy friend; thou haſt not many Nations to combyne
with thee, yet thys is thy comfort, if thou doſt relie vpon
God, he is able to delyuer thee from all. There were fiue
Kinges ſet againſt Abraham, Gen. 14, and as many agaynſt
Ioshua. Ioſh. 10, 16: yet Abraham and Ioshua got the victorie.
Some aledge that the ſpaniſh Nauie is mighty, both

in regard of hys long tyme of preparation, as of hys laſt
euerſion, which will make him come the more forceable,
for feare of a double foyle. To thys I aunſwere, though
hys Nauie were innumerable, and he ſhould arrogate this
tytle, as he dyd laſt time, that it is an inuincible Nauie, yet
for all his great power and pride, God can deale with him
now as hee dyd then, not onelie to diſpierce and ſcatter
them in vnknowne Coaſtes, but alſo make the Spanyard
lyke Senacherib, returne with ſhame to hys owne Land, 2,
Chro. 32, 21. Admit hee comes with many millyons of
men; yet wee muſt conſider that hee intrudeth into hys
Ships all ſortes of people, ſome that came neuer at Sea, others
that cannot away with the Sea; now who knowes
not that ſuch as be weather-beaten and cannot brooke the
Seas, are ſo infeebled, that when they come to the pynch,
they had more neede of Phiſitions to looke to them, then
furniture to defend them. A more morrall reaſon is thys,
be he neuer ſo mightie, it is but an arme of fleſh, they can
do no more then men; If God be with vs he can do more
then men. If we be penitent for our ſinnes, and depende
vpon him, it is not the Nauie or number of men of the Enemie
can iniure vs: for as it is written in Leuiticus, vvee
ſhall be able with one thouſand men, to chaſe away twentie
thouſand, Leuit. 26. VVee haue examples of it for our
comfort.
                  The Madianites, and Amalakites, and many of the Eaſt,
of whom it is vvritten, lay in valleis lyke Graſhoppers in
multitude, and theyr Cammels were vvithout number, as
the Sand is by the Sea-ſide, Iudges 7, 12. All theſe came
againſt the Captayne of the Iſralites, who had but three
hundred men, and yet he diſcomfited them.
                  
                     Zerah came with ten hundred thouſand men, and three
hundred Charrets, againſt Aſa, who had but fiue hundred

foure-ſcore thouſand men, yet he incountred with him &amp;
ouer-came them, 2, Chro, 14.
                  
                     Auguſtine vpon the 13, pſalme con: 2. ſayth, Hee is trulie
valiant vvho is not ſtrong in himſelfe but in the Lord. Our
chiefe valure conſiſteth in God, but the confidence of the
wicked in theyr power, Eſay, 31, 1, 2. GOD in iudgment
doth puniſh ſuch as ſtande vpon theyr owne ſtrength, but
in mercy he protecteth thoſe which haue a truſt in him in
theyr troubles.
                  2 Some ſiniſter ciuill practice. Thys is the common
ſaying: if we be true within our ſelues, we neede not care
or feare the enemy. Many ſuſpect the Papiſts. The wicked
many times will ſuſpect the godly, and therefore it is
not amiſſe for Conformoliſts to ſuſpect Recuſants. Pharaoh
that wicked tyrant, feared and ſuſpected the Iſralits,
for (ſayth he,) Come let vs worke wiſely with them, leaſt
they multiply, and it come to paſſe that if there be vvarre,
they ioyne themſelues alſo vnto our enemies, and fight againſt
vs: Exod, 1, 10. Therefore it is good policie where
there be ſuſpicious perſons, to preuent the occaſions that
may effect theyr ill pretence, by reſtrayning theyr libertie,
deteyning theyr armor, not admitting them to any office
in Armes, &amp;c.
                  If two dogs be ſtryuing for a bone, when they ſee the
Beare, they will both forſake the bone to flye vppon the
Beare: and certes (though the compariſon be ſome-what
groſſe) I take it, albeit the Papiſts iarre about matters of
Religion, yet when they ſee the Spanyard, they wil ioyne
with vs againſt him, if it were but to ſaue theyr liues. Pilate
and Herod were at great ods about priuate matters between
them, but when they had to deale with Chriſt, they
could then become friends, &amp; conioyne together for hys
deſtruction, Luke, 23, 12, then much more ought the Papiſts

for all theyr opinions, reconcile themſelues and ioyne
with vs againſt the Spaniard, who deſerueth death more
then Chriſt. The dog will fawne of his Maiſter, but barke
at ſtrangers, farre worſe were they then dogs, if they doe
not affect theyr Prince, and fight againſt her enemies.
                  In Ieruſalem there were ſome irreligious perſons, as bad
as Nabuchadnezer himſelfe, yet when hee beſieged it, hee
killed and captiuated all ſauing a fewe poore, which were
left to looke to the grounds, 2, Reg. 24, euen ſo let the Papiſts
thinke, if the worſt ſhould fall (as God defend,) the
Spaniard will deale as Nabuchadnezer did, he wil not ſpare
a Papiſt though he be a Papiſt: (but he will rather ſuppoſe
it is done of policie to poſſeſſe life) and therefore in this regard
they ſhould arme themſelues againſt the enemie, becauſe
they are like to ſpeed no better thē we, if he preuaile.
                  
                     Themiſtocles had rather die then beare Armes againſt his
Country; VVhat more neere to any then his natiue coū
                     try?
For thys cauſe I reade of Zeno, who being taken by a
Tyrant, and enioyned to tortures, he bit out his tongue &amp;
ſpit it in the Tyrants face, for feare the extreamitie of the
payne ſhould make him confeſſe any thing againſt his
Country. Let theſe Heathen men excite vs to carrie true
harts to our Country, for as Paedanius ſaith, he that betraies
his Country, is worſe then he that beſiegeth it.
                  
                     Treaſon hath been odious in all ages,

                           To Man,
                           To God.
                        
                     
                  
                  To Man it is odious. Antigonus the King, woulde alwayes
ſay, I loue Traytors ſo long as they are in betraying,
but when they haue betrayed I hate thē. Ierome to Pammachius
ſayth: that Princes doe indeed admit treaſon, but

they condemne the Traytors. Hier. de optimo genere interpretandi.
                  
                  
                     Many betray their
country in hope of

                           Preferment
                           Reward
                           Loue

                                 of the Enemie.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  Yet commonly they fayle in theyr purpoſe, and receiue in
ſteede of preferment reproch, in ſteede of reward, puniſhment,
and in ſteed of loue, hatred.
                  As for preferment, we reade of Laſthenes, who when
he had betrayed hys Countrie to King Phillip of Macedonia,
he expected to haue had ſome preferment and dignitie
for hys deede, but the common Souldiers in deryſion,
called hym euer after by no other name but TRAYTOR:
inſomuch as he complayned to King Phillip for
redreſſe, the King made hym thys aunſwere, the Macedonians
are rude and playne people, and knowe not how to
call things, but by theyr own proper name, noting heereby
that as he had committed treaſon, ſo he iuſtly deſerued
no other name but Traytor.
                  As for Reward, we read of certayne Phaliſcian Scholemen,
vvho hoping of reward, went about to betray theyr
Countrie to Camillus: vvho rewarded them as they deſerued,
for hee commaunded that they ſhould be brought
home agayne, into theyr owne Countrie, with the ſtrypes
of theyr own Schollers, becauſe they would haue betrayed
them. Menelaus preſumed of ſome reward, vvhen hee
ſought to betray his Countrie to Eupator, ſo hee had, for
he commaunded he ſhould be put to death for his deſert,
2, Mach. 13.
                  As for Loue, vvee reade of the King of the Thraciaris,
who in hope of fauour, fell from Anthonie, to Auguſtus,
which afterward he boaſted on, in the preſence of Auguſtus
and others; but Auguſtus turned hym to hys friend, and

ſayd, I loue the Treaſon but the Traytor I commend not.
Plutarch, King Pyrhus Phiſition promiſed to the Romayns,
that he would for theyr ſakes, worke treaſon agaynſt hys
King and Countrie, they were ſo far from fauouring hys
ill pretence, that they dyd detect hym to his King, that he
might take heede of hym; that example of Iudas, may be
pretelie heere-vnto applyed, the Iewes made of Iudas,
whileſt he was a working the Treaſon, but vvhen he had
done, they made no force of him; for when he told them,
he was touched and diſturbed for the treacherie, vvhat is
that to vs (ſay they) ſee thou to it, Math. 27, 4. A Traytor
may haue ſome kind intertaynement for the tyme, but he
ſhall neuer haue any matter of truſt committed to him, for
he that will betray hys natiue Countrie, ſhall liue euer ſuſpected
of falſehood in a forrayne Nation.
                  To GOD. Treaſon is an odious thing to God, and ſo
odious, that although it ſhould paſſe vnpuniſhed amongſt
men, yet he will purſue a traytor himſelfe with his iudgements,
whereof we haue many examples in the ſcriptures.
Abſalom committed treaſon againſt Dauid hys father, and
Zimri againſt Elah hys Maiſter, yet for all that, Dauid dyd
not puniſh hys Sonne, nor Elah hys Seruant, the Lord
ſhewed hys iudgments vpon them, for one vvas hanged
by hys owne haire, 2, Sam. 28, and the other burnt hymſelfe,
1, King, 16, 18.
                  
                     Iaſon was a notable Traytor to his Countrie, and raunged
lyke a roge or vagobond afterward from Countrie to
Countrie, he did eſcape the puniſhment of men, but God
ſtill purſued hym, tyll at laſt comming to Lacedemonia,
where he had thought to haue had reliefe, he dyed moſt
miſerablie, vvanting the laſt office of humanitie, which is
buriall, 2, Mach. 5, 7, 8, &amp;c.
                  There be many, yet I will but note one other worthie

example. Iehoiakim betrayed and rebelled againſt Nabuchadnezzer,
a wicked King, this action ſo much diſpleaſed
the Lord, that he rayſed vp many bands of men agaynſt
Iehoiakim, to aflict hym for his treacherie, 2, King 24, 1. If
the Lord will puniſh ſuch as worke treaſon againſt theyr
King, though he be a tyrant, vvhat will hee doo to thoſe
that betray a good Prince, which mayntaynes the Goſpell.
                  Sithence treaſon is ſo odious to God and man, as Barnherd
ſayth, Aliorum perditio tua ſit cautio, let other mens deſtruction
be our permonition, and let euery one of vs carrie
true harts to our Queene and Countrie; If it be a puniſhment
to haue a Tyrant to raigne, and a double puniſhment
to haue hym taken away, Hoſea 13, 11, (for better is
a Tyrant, then no gouernour, Iudg. 17, 6,) vvhat a bleſſing
is it to haue a godlie Prince, as we haue, and a double
bleſsing to enioy her dayes as we doe, but how vnſpeakeis
our puniſhment, if we looſe her; therefore let vs vnite
our heads, harts, and hands, and venture our own liuings
and liues for the preſeruation, &amp; defence of ſuch a Prince;
Then we may be fully reſolued, (if we haue had vnfeyned
repentance for onr ſinnes, and make defenſible preparation
for our ſelues, and vſe feruent prayers for our ſucceſſe)
that God will ſo bleſſe vs with the meanes, as we ſhall not
neede to feare the iniurious aſſault of that proud Senacharib
of Spayne. Let Ahab call vpon Baal; the Turke vpon
Mahumet, in their troubles, and the Spanyard vpon Idols
in hys attempts, we wil pray and depend vpon the God of
Iſrael; And if Symachus boaſted that in his wars his woodden
gods did deliuer him from the Senons, D. Mar. co. Ro.
we may be aſſured that our immortall and liuing God, can
and wil deliuer vs from the Spaniard.
