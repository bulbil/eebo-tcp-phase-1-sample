            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

this tranſlation of Pastor Fido.
            I do reioyce learned and worthy Knight,
            That by the hand of thy kinde Country-man
            (This painfull and induſtrious Gentleman)
            Thy deare esteem'd Guarini comes to light:
            Who in thy loue I know tooke great delight
            As thou in his▪ who now in England can
            Speake as good Engliſh as Italian,
            And here enioyes the grace of his owne right.
            Though I remember he hath oft imbaſ'd
            
               Ʋnto vs both, the vertues of the North,
            Saving, our coſtes were with no meaſures grac'd,
            Nor barbarous tongues could any verſe bring forth.
            I would he ſawe his owne, or knew our ſtore,
            Whoſe ſpirits can yeeld as much, and if not more.

his kinſman, Syr Edward Dymock.
            A ſilly hand hath faſhioned vp a ſute
            Of Engliſh clothes vnto a traueller,

            That might conſort his tunes with Taſſoes lute,
            Learned Guarinies firſt begotten frute,
            I haue aſſum'd the courage to rebeare,
            And him an Engliſh Denizen made here,
            Preſenting him vnto the ſonnes of Brute.
            If I haue faild t'expreſſe his natiue looke,
            And be in my tranſlation tax'd of blame,
            I muſt appeale to that true cenſure, booke
            That ſayes, t'is harder to reforme a frame,
            Then for to build from ground worke of ones wit,

                     Then thus in ſhunning you? ſhe heares in vaine,
                     And ſhunnes with pittie that can giue no helpe.
                     It is ſound counſell, ſoone to ceaſe deſiring,
                     When we cannot attaine to our aſpiring.
                  
                  
                     Mi.
                     Oh were this true, could I but this beleeue,
                     
                        
Thriſe happie paine. Thriſe fortunate diſtreſſe.
                     But tell me ſweet Ergusto, tell me true,
                     Which is the ſhepheard whom the ſtarres ſo friend?
                  
                  
                     Erguſt.
                     Knowſt thou not Siluio Montane's onely ſonne?
                     
                        Dianaes prieſt: that rich and famous ſhepheard,
                     That gallant youth? He is the very ſame.
                  
                  
                     Mi.
                     Moſt happie youth, that haſt in tender yeares
                     Found fate ſo ripe. I do not enuy thee,
                     But plaine my ſelfe.
                  
                  
                     Erg.
                     Nor need you enuy him
                     That pittie more then enuy doth deſerue.
                  
                  
                     Mi.
                     Pittie! and why?
                  
                  
                     Erg.
                     Becauſe he loues her not.
                  
                  
                     Mi.
                     And liues he? hath a hart? and is not blinde?
                     Or hath ſhe on my wretched hart ſpent all her flames?
                     And her faire eyes blowne all their loues on mee?
                     Why ſhould they giue a lemme ſo precious
                     To one that neither knowes it, nor regards it?
                  
                  
                     Erg.
                     For that the heauens the health of Arcady
                     
                     Do promiſe at theſe nuptialls. Know you not
                     How we do ſtil appeaſe our goddeſſe wrath,
                     Each yeare with guiltleſſe blood of ſome poore Nymphe?
                     A mortall and a miſerable tribute.
                  
                  
                     Mi.
                     T'is newes to mee, that am a new inhabitant,
                     As't pleaſeth loue and my poore deſteny:
                     That did before inhabit ſauadge woods,
                     But what I pray you was that greeuous fault
                     That kindled rage in a celeſtiall breſt?
                  
                  
                     Erg.
                     I will report the dolefull tragedy
                     From the beginning of our miſery,
                     That able are pittie and plaints to drawe
                     From theſe hard rocks, much more from humane breſts.
                     In that ſame golden age when holy prieſthood, and
                     The temples charge was not prohibited
                     To youth. A noble ſwaine Amintas call'd,
                     Prieſt at that time, loued Lucrina bright:
                     A beauteous Nymphe, exceeding faire: but therewithall
                     Exceeding falſe, and light. Long time ſhe loued him,
                     Orat the leaſt, ſhe ſeemed ſo, with fained face
                     Nurſing his pure affections with falſe hopes.
                     
                        
Whilſt ſhe no other ſuters had. But ſee
                     Th' vnconſtant wretch! no ſooner was ſhe wooed
                     By a rude ſhepheard, but at firſt aſſault,
                     At his firſt ſighe, ſhe yeelded vp her loue:
                     Before Amintas dream't of Iealouſie.
                     At laſt Amintas was forlorne, deſpide,
                     So that the wicked woman would nor ſee, nor heare
                     Him ſpeake, now if the wretch did ſigh,
                     Be thou the iudge that knowſt his paine by proofe.
                  
                  
                     Mi.
                     Aye me, this griefe all other griefs exceeds.
                  
                  
                     Er.
                     After he had his heart recouered
                     From his complaints, he to his goddeſſe turnes,
                     And praying ſaves: Great Cinthia if I haue
                     At any time kindled with guiltleſſe hands
                     The holy flames, reuenge thou then for me
                     This broken faith of my vnconſtant Nimphe.
                     
                        Diana heares the praiers of her prieſt,
                     And ſtraight out-breathing rage, ſhe takes her bowe
                     And ſhootes ſhafts of mennitable death
                     Into the bowels of Arcadia.
                     
                     People of euery ſexe, of euery age,
                     Soone periſhed, no ſuccour could be found,
                     T'was bootleſſe art to ſearch for remedies,
                     For often on the patient the phiſitian died.
                     One onely remedie did reſt, which was
                     Strait to the neareſt Oracle they went,
                     From whom they had an anſwere verie cleare,
                     But aboue meaſure deadly horrible.
                     Which was, our Cinthia was diſpleaſd, and to
                     Appeaſe herire, either Lucrina or ſome elſe for her,
                     Muſt by Amintas hands be ſacrifiz'd.
                     Who when ſhe had long time in vaine complain'd,
                     And lookt for helpe from her new friend in vaine,
                     Was to the ſacred Altars led with ſolemne pompe,
                     A wofull ſacrifice. Where at thoſe ſeete
                     Which had purſued her long time in vaine
                     At her betrayed Louers feete ſhe bends
                     Her rtembling knees, attending cruell death.
                     
                        
                        Amintas ſtretcheth out the holy ſword,
                     Seeming to breath from his inflamed lippes,
                     Rage and reuenge; turning to her his face,
                     Speakes with a ſigh, the meſſenger of death:
                     
                        Lucrina for thy further paines, behold
                     What Louer thou haſt left, and what purſude
                     Iudge by this blow. And with that very word
                     Striketh the blade into his wofull breſt,
                     Falling a ſacrifice vpon the ſacrifice.
                     At ſuch a ſtraunge and cruell ſpectacle,
                     The Nymphe amazed ſtand twixt life and death,
                     Scarce yet aſſur'd whether ſhe wounded were
                     With griefe, or with the ſword. At laſt, aſſoone
                     As ſhe recouered had, her ſpright, and ſpeech,
                     She plaining ſaies. O faithfull valiant loue!
                     O too late knowne! that by thy death haſt giu'n
                     Me life and death at once. If t' were a fault
                     To leaue thee ſo? behold I'le mend it now,
                     Eternally vniting both our ſoules,
                     And therewithall ſhe takes the ſword, all warme,
                     With the blood of her too late loued friend,
                     And ſtrikes it through her hart, falling vpon
                     
                        Amintas, that was ſcarcely dead as yet,
                     And felt perchance that fall. Such was their ende,
                     To ſuch a wretched end did too much loue,
                     And too much trechery conduct them both.
                  
                  
                     Mi.
                     O wretched Shepheard, and yet fortunate,
                     That hadſt ſo large and famous ſcope, to ſhowe
                     Thy troth, and waken liuely pittie of thy death
                     Within anothers breſt. But what did follow?
                     Was Cinthia pleaſd, found they a remedie?
                  
                  
                     Er.
                     Somewhat it ſlak't, but yet not quite put out:
                     For after that a yeare was finiſhed,
                     Her rage began a freſh, ſo that of force
                     They driuen were, vnto the Oracle:
                     To aske new counſell, but brought back againe
                     An anſwere much more wofull then the firſt.
                     Which was, to ſacrifice them: and each after yeare,
                     
                        
A maid, or woman, to our angry power,
                     Eu'n till the third and paſt the fourth degree:
                     So ſhould ones blood for many ſatisfie.
                     Beſides, ſhe did vpon th' vnhappie ſexe,
                     Impoſe a wretched and a cruell lawe.
                     And (if you marke their nature) in obſeruable.
                     A law recorded with vermilian blood:
                     What euer maid or woman broken had
                     Their faith in loue, and were contaminate,
                     If they ſhould find none that would die for them▪
                     
                     They were condemn'd without remiſſion.
                     To theſe our greeuous great calamities,
                     The fathers hop'd to finde a happie ende,
                     By this deſired marriage day. For afterward
                     Hauing demaunded of the Oracle
                     What end the heauens preſcribed had our ill,
                     Anſwere was giu'n in ſuch like words as theſe:
                     No end there is to that which you offends,
                     Till two of heauens iſſue loue vnite;
                     And for the auncient fault of that falſe wight,
                     A faithfull Shepheards pittie make amends.
                     Now is there not in all Arcadia
                     
                     Other bowes left, of that celeſtiall roote:
                     Saue Amarillis, and this Siluio,
                     
                     Th' one of Pans ſeed, th' other of Hercules.
                     
                     Nor to our miſchiefe yet hath neuer hapt,
                     That male and female met at any time
                     Till now. Therefore good reaſon Montane hath
                     To hope, though all things ſort not to the Oracle,
                     Yet here's a good foundation laid: the reſt
                     High fates haue in their boſomes bred,
                     And will bring forth at this great marriage day.
                  
                  
                     Mi.
                     O poore Mirtillo! wretched man!
                     So many cruell enemies? ſuch warres?
                     To worke my death cannot great Loue ſuffice?
                     But that the Fates, their armes will exerciſe.
                  
                  
                     Er.
                     This cruell loue (Mirtillo) feeds himſelfe
                     With teares, and griefe, but's neuer ſatisfide.
                     
                     I promiſe thee to ſet my wits a worke,
                     That the faire Nymphe ſhall heare thee ſpeake. Lets goe?
                     Theſe burning ſighes do not as they do ſeeme,
                     Bring any cooling to th'inflamed hart:
                     But rather are huge and impetuous windes,
                     That blow the fire, and make it greater proue,
                     With ſwelling whirlwindes of tempeſtuous loue,
                     Which vnto wretched louers alwaies beares
                     Thick cloudes of griefe, and ſhowres of dreary teares.
                  
               
               
                  Scene. 3. 
                  Coriſca.
                  
                     WHo euer ſawe or heard a ſtraunger, and
                     A fonder paſſion of this fooliſh loue?
                     Both loue, and hate, in one ſelfe hart combin'd,
                     With ſuch a wondrous mixture: as I know not how,
                     Or which of them hath got the deeper roote.
                     If I Mirtilloes beautie do behold:
                     His gracious count'nance, good behauior,
                     Actions, cuſtomes, words and manly lookes:
                     Loue me aſſailes, with ſuch a puiſſant fire,
                     That I burne altogither. And it ſeemes
                     Other affections are quite vanquiſhed with this.
                     But when I thinke vpon th'obſtinate loue
                     He to another beares; and that for her
                     He doth deſpiſe (I will be bold to say)
                     My famous beautie of a thouſand ſoft:
                     
                        I hate him ſo, I ſo abhorre the man,
                     That t's impoſſible me thinkes at all,
                     One ſparke of loue for him ſhould touch my heart.
                     Thus with my ſelfe ſometime I ſay: Oh if I could
                     Enioy my ſweet Mirtillo! were he mine,
                     And had not others intereſt in him,
                     Oh more then any other happie Coriſca.
                     
                     And then in me vpflames ſuch great good will,
                     And ſuch a gentle loue to him; that I reſolue
                     Straight to diſcouer all my hart to him,
                     To follow him, and humbly ſue to him:
                     Nay more, eu'n to fall downe and worſhip him.
                     
                     On th'other ſide, I all reclaimed say,
                     A niceproud foole? one that diſdaineth me?
                     One that can loue another and deſpiſe my ſelfe?
                     One that can looke on me and not adore me?
                     One that can ſo defend him from my looke,
                     That he dies not for loue. And I that ſhould
                     See him (as I haue many more ere this)
                     An humble ſuppliant before my feete,
                     Am humble ſuppliant at his feete my ſelfe.
                     Then ſuch a rage at him poſſeſſeth mee,
                     That I diſdain my thoughts ſhould think on him,
                     Mine eyes ſhould looke on him. His verie name
                     And all my loue, I worſe then death do hate.
                     Then would I haue him the wofulſt wight aliue:
                     And with theſe hands then could I kill the wretch.
                     Thus hate, and loue, ſpight, and deſire make warre.
                     
                        I that haue bene till now tormenting flame,
                     To thouſand harts: muſt languiſh now my ſelfe,
                     And in my ill, know others wretchedneſſe.
                     
                        I that ſo many years in cities, ſtreets, courts,
                     Haue bene inuincible to worthy friends,
                     Mocking their many hopes, their great deſires:
                     Now conquered am, with ſilly ruſticke loue,
                     Of a baſe ſhepherds brat. Oh aboue all
                     Wretched Coriſca now. What ſhall I do
                     To mitigate this amorous furious rage?
                     Whilſt other women haue a heape of loues,
                     
                        I haue no other but Mirtillo onely.
                     Am I not stoutly furnished? Oh thouſand times,
                     Ill-counſell'd foole! that now reduced art
                     Into the pouertie of one ſole loue:
                     
                        Coriſca was ne're ſuch a foole before.
                     What's faith? what's conſtancy? but fables fain'd
                     By iealous men: and names of vanitie,
                     Simple women to deceiue. Faith in a womans hart,
                     (If faith in any womans hart there bee:)
                     Can neither vertue nor yet goodneſſe bee.
                     But hard neceſſitie of loue, a wretched law
                     
                        
Of beautie weake that pleaſeth onely one,
                     Becauſe ſhe is not gracious in the eyes of more.
                     A beautious Nymphe, ſought too by multitudes
                     Of worthy louers, if ſhe be content
                     With onely one, and all the reſt deſpiſe,
                     Either ſhe is no woman, or if ſo ſhe be,
                     She is a foole. What's beautie worth vnſeene?
                     Or ſeene, vnſought? or ſought too but of one?
                     The more our louers be, the greater men,
                     The ſurer pledge haue we in this vild world.
                     That we are creatures glorious and rare,
                     The goodly ſplendor of a beautious Nymphe,
                     Is to haue many friends. So in good Townes
                     Wiſe men euer doo. It is a fault,
                     A fooliſh tricke, all to refuſe for one.
                     What one cannot, many can well performe:
                     Some ſerue, ſome giue, ſome fit for other vſe.
                     So in the Citie louely Ladies do,
                     Where I by wit, and by example too,
                     Of a great Lady learnd the Art of loue.
                     
                        Coriſca would ſhe ſay. Let thy
                     Louers and thy garments be alike.
                     Haue many, vſe, weare but one, and change often.
                     Too much conuerſing breedeth noyſomeneſſe,
                     And noyſomeneſſe deſpight, which turnes to hate:
                     We cannot worſer do, then fill our friends,
                     Let them go hungry rather from thee ſtill.
                     So did I alwaies, alwaies louing ſtore,
                     One for my hand, an other for mine eye:
                     The beſt I euer for my boſome kept,
                     None for my heart, as neare as ere I could.
                     And now I know not how Mirtillo comes
                     Me to torment, now muſt I figh, and worſe
                     Sigh for my ſelfe, deceiuing no man elſe.
                     Now muſt I robbe my limmes of their repoſe,
                     Mine eyes of ſleepe, and watch the breake of day:
                     Now do I wander through theſe ſhadow'd woods,
                     Seeking the footſteps of my hated loue.
                     
                        
What muſt Coriſca do? ſhall I entreat him?
                     No: my hate not giues me leaue. Ile giue him o're,
                     Nor will my loue conſent. What ſhall I do?
                     Prayers and ſubtilties I will attempt:
                     I will bewray my loue, but not as mine,
                     If this preuaile not, then Ile make diſdaine
                     Finde out a memorable huge reuenge.
                     
                        Mirtillo if thou canſt not like my loue,
                     Then ſhalt thou trie my hate. And Amarillis,
                     
                     Thou ſhalt repent thou er'e my riuall wer't.
                     Well, to your coſts you both ſhall quickly proue,
                     What rage in her can do that thus doth loue.

                     SO helpe me Gods, I know I now do ſpeake
                     To one that vnderſtands more then I do.
                     Theſe Oracles are ſtill more doubtfull then
                     We take them, for their words are like to kniues,
                     Which taken by the hafts, are fit for vſe,
                     But by the edges held, they may do harme.
                     That Amarillis as you argue, is
                     By the high heauenly Deſtenies elected for
                     
                        Arcadiaes vniuerſall health: who ought
                     More to deſire, or to eſteeme the ſame
                     Then I that am her father
                           •
                         but when I regard
                     That which the Oracle foretold, ill do the ſignes
                     Agree with our great hopes: ſince loue ſhould then
                     Vnite, how falls it out he ſlies from her?
                     How can hate and deſpight bring forth loues fruite?
                     Ill could he contradict had heau'ns ordain'd it.
                     But ſince he doth contrary it, t'is cleare,
                     Heauens do not will: for if ſo they would
                     That Amarillis ſhould be Siluioes wiſe,
                     A Louer, not a Huntſman, him they would haue made.
                  
                  
                     Mon.
                     Do you not ſee he is a child as yet?
                     He hath attain'd ſcarcely to eighteene yeares,
                     All in good time he may yet taſte of loue.
                  
                  
                     
                     Tit.
                     Taſte of a beaſt, heele neueuer woman like.
                  
                  
                     Mon.
                     Many things alter in a yong mans heart.
                  
                  
                     Tit.
                     But alwaies loue is naturall to youth.
                  
                  
                     Mon.
                     It is vnnaturall where yeares do want.
                  
                  
                     Ti.
                     Loue alwaies ſlowres in our green time of age.
                  
                  
                     Mon.
                     It doth but flowere, t'is quite without all fruit.
                  
                  
                     Ti.
                     With timely flowres loue euer brings forth fruit.
                     Hither I came not for to ieaſt (Montane)
                     Nor to contend with you. But I the father am
                     Of a deare onely child, and (if't be lawfull ſo to ſay)
                     A worthy child, and by your leaue of many ſought.

                        Titirus, if the Deſtenies haue not ordain'd
                     This marriage, yet the faith they gaue on earth,
                     Bindes them vntoo't, which if they violate,
                     They violate their vow to Cinthia,
                     
                     Who is enrag'd gainſt vs, how much thou knowſt.
                     But for as much as I diſcouer can,
                     The ſecret counſailes of th' eternall powers:
                     This knot was knit by th' and of Deſteny.
                     All to good end will ſort, be of good cheere.
                     I'le tell you now a dreame I had laſt night.
                     I ſawe a thing which makes my auncient hope
                     Reuiue within my heart, more then before.
                  
                  
                     Tit.
                     Dreames in the end proue dreames, but what ſaw you?
                  
                  
                     Mon.
                     Do you remember that ſame wofull night,
                     When ſwelling Ladon oue
                           •
                        flowd his bankes,
                     So that the fiſhes ſwam where birds did breed,
                     And in moment did the rauenous floud,
                     Take men and beaſts by heapes and heards away.
                     (Oh ſad remembrance) in that very night
                     
                        I loſt my child, more deare then was my heart:
                     Mine onely child, in cradle warmly laid.
                     Liuing, and dead, dearely belou'd of me.
                     The Torrent tooke him hence ere we could prooue
                     To giue him ſuccour, being buried quite,
                     In terrour, ſleepe, and darkneſſe of the night:
                     Nor could we euer find the cradle where he lay,
                     By which I geſſe ſome whirlpit ſwallowd both.
                  
                  
                     
                     Tit.
                     Who can geſſe otherwiſe? and I remember now,
                     You told me of this your miſhap before:
                     A memorable miſaduenture ſure,
                     And you may ſay, you haue two ſonnes begot,
                     One to the woods, the other to the waues.
                  
                  
                     Mon.
                     Perhaps the pitious heauens will reſtore
                     My firſt ſonnes loſſe, in him that liueth yet;
                     Still muſt we hope, now liſten to my tale.
                     The time when light and darkneſſe ſtroue together,
                     This one for night, that other for the day,
                     Hauing watcht all the night before, with thought
                     To bring this marriage to a happie end,
                     At laſt, with length of wearineſſe, mine eyes
                     A pleaſing ſlumber cloſde, when I this viſion ſawe,
                     Me thought I ſat on famous Alfeus banke,
                     Vnder a leauy plane tree with a bayted hooke,
                     Tempting the fiſhes in the ſtreame, in midſt
                     Whereof, there roſe me thought an aged man:
                     His head and beard dropping downe ſiluer teares,
                     Who gently raught to me with both his hands
                     A naked childe, ſaying, behold thy ſoone,
                     Take heed thou killſt him not. And with that word
                     He diued downe againe. When ſtraight the skies
                     Waxt blacke with cloudes, threatning a diſmall ſhowre,
                     And I afraid, the child tooke in mine armes,
                     Crying, ah heauens, and will you in an inſtant then,
                     Both giue and take away my child againe?
                     When on the ſudden all the skie waxt cleare:
                     And in the Riuer ſell a thouſand bowes,
                     And thouſand arrowes, broken all to ſhiuers.
                     The body of the plane tree trembled there,
                     And out of it there came a ſubtill voyce
                     Which ſaid, Arcadia ſhalbe faire againe.
                     So is the Image of this gentle dreame
                     Fixt in my heart, that ſtill me thinkes I ſee't:
                     But aboue all, the curteous aged man.
                     For this when you me met, I comming was
                     Vnto the temple for to ſacrifize,
                     
                        
To giue my dreames preſage proſperous ſucceſſe.
                  
                  
                     Tit.
                     Our dreames are rather repreſentments vaine
                     Of Idle hopes, then any things to come:
                     Onely daies thoughts made fables for the night.
                  
                  
                     Mon.
                     The mind doth not ſleepe euer with the fleſh,
                     But is more watchfull then, becauſe the eyes
                     Do not lead it a wandring where they goe.
                  
                  
                     Tit.
                     Well, of cur children what the heauens diſpoſed haue,
                     Is quite vnknowne to vs, but ſure it is,
                     Yours gainſt the law of nature feeles not loue.
                     And mine hath but the bond of his faith giu'n
                     For her reward. I cannot ſay ſhe loues,
                     But well I wot ſhe hath made many loue:
                     And t'is vnlike, ſhe taſtes not that ſhe makes
                     So many taſte. Me thinkes ſhee's alter'd much
                     From that ſhe was: for full of ſport and mirth,
                     Shee's wont to be. But t'is a grieuous thing,
                     To keepe a woman married and vnmarried thus.
                     For like a Roſe that in ſome garden growes,
                     How daintie t'is againſt the Sunne doth riſe,
                     Perſuming with ſweete odours round about,
                     Bidding the humming bees to honey feaſt:
                     But if you then neglect to gather it,
                     And ſuffer Titan in his middayes courſe
                     To ſcorch her ſides, and burne her daintie ſeat,
                     Then ere Sun-ſet, diſcoloured ſhe falls,
                     And nothing worth vpon the ſhadow'd hedge.
                     Euen ſo a maid whom mothers care doth keepe,
                     Shu
                           ••
                        ing her heart from amorous deſires.
                     But if the piercing lookes of hungry louers eyes
                     Come but to view her, if ſhe heare him ſigh,
                     Her heart ſoone ope's, her breaſt ſoone takes in loue:
                     Which if for ſhame ſhe hide, or feare containe,
                     The ſilent wretch in deepe deſire conſumes.
                     So fadeth beautie if that fire endure,
                     And leeſing time, good fortune's loſt be ſure.
                  
                  
                     Mon.
                     Be of good cheare, let not theſe humane feares,
                     Confound thy ſpright, let's put our truſt

And pray to them (t'is meet) for good ſucceſſe.
                     Our children are their off-ſpring, and be ſure
                     They will not ſee them loſt that others keepe.
                     Go'w, let vs to the Temple ioyntly goe,
                     And ſacrifize you a hee Goat to Pan,

                     I at the Temple will attend for thee.

                     Both one and other I will well performe.
                     
                        I pray the Gods (Montane) thy dreame do ſort
                     Vnto as good an end as thou doſt hope.

                     Satir alone.
                     LIke froſt to graſſe, like drought to gentle flowres,
                     Like lightning vnto corne, like wormes to ſeeds,
                     Like nets to deere, like lime to ſilly birds,
                     So to mankind is loue a cruell foe.
                     He that loue lik'ned vnto fire, knew well
                     His pe
                           •
                        fidous and wicked kind. For looke
                     But on this fire, how fine a thing it is.
                     But touch it, and t'is then a cruell thing.
                     The world hath not a monſter more to dread.
                     It rauens worſe then beaſts, and ſtrikes more deepe
                     Then edged ſteele, and like the winde it ſlies:
                     And where it planteth his imperious feet,
                     Each force doth yeeld, all power giueth place.
                     Eu'n ſo this loue, if we it but behold,
                     In two faire eyes, and in a golden Treſſe,
                     Oh how it pleaſeth! oh how then it ſeemes
                     To breathe out ioy, and promiſe largely peace!
                     
                        
But if you it approach, and tempt it once,
                     So that it creepe and gather force in you,
                     
                        Hircane no Tigres, Liby no Lyons hath,
                     Nor poiſonous wormes, with teeth or ſtings ſo fierce,
                     That can ſurpaſſe, or equall loues diſeaſe,
                     More dreadfull then is hell, then death it ſelfe,
                     Sweete pitties foe, the miniſter of rage:
                     And to conclude, loue voyd of any loue.
                     Why ſpeake I thus of loue? why blame him thus?
                     Is he the cauſe that the whole world in loue,
                     Or rather loue-diſſembling, ſinneth ſo?
                     Oh womans treacherie! that is the cauſe
                     That hath begotten loue this infamy.
                     How euer loue be in his nature good,
                     With them his goodneſſe ſuddenly he leeſeth.
                     They neuer ſuffer him to touch their hearts,
                     But in their faces onely build his bowre.
                     Their care, their pompe, and all their whole delight.
                     Is in the barke of a bepainted face.
                     T'is not in them now faith with faith to grace,
                     And to contend in loue with him that loues,
                     Into two breaſts diuiding but one will:
                     Now all their labour is, with burniſh'd gold
                     To die their haire, and tye it vp in curles,
                     Therein to ſnare vnwary louers in.
                     O what a ſtinking thing it is, to ſee them take
                     A Pencill vp, and paint their bloudleſſe cheekes:
                     Hiding the faults of nature and of time,
                     Making the pale to bluſh, the wrinkled plaine,
                     The blacke ſeeme white, faults mending with farre worſe.
                     Then with a paire of pincers do they pull
                     Their eye-browes till they ſmart againe.
                     But this is nothing, though it be too much,
                     For all their cuſtomes are alike to theſe.
                     What is it that they vſe, which is not counterfeit?
                     Ope they their mouthes? they lie: mooue they their eyes?
                     They counterfeit their lookes: If ſo they ſigh,
                     Their ſighes diſſembled are. In ſumme, each act,
                     
                        
Each looke, each geſture, is a verie lie.
                     Nor is this yet the worſt. T'is their delight,
                     Them to deceiue eu'n moſt, that truſt them moſt;
                     And loue them leaſt, that are moſt worthy loue.
                     True faith to hate, worſer then death it ſelfe:
                     Theſe be the trickes that make loue ſo peruerſe.
                     Then is the fault faithleſſe Coriſca thine?
                     Or rather mine, that haue beleeu'd thee ſo?
                     How many troubles haue I for thy ſake ſuſtaind?
                     I now repent, nay more I am aſhamed.
                     Louers beleeue me, women once ador'd,
                     Are worſer then the griefly powers of hell.
                     Strait by their valure vaunt they that they are
                     The ſame you by your folly faſhion them.
                     Let go theſe baſe
                           •
                         ſighes, praiers and plaints,
                     Fit weapons for women and children onely.
                     Once did I thinke that praiers, plaints, and ſighes,
                     Might in a womans heart haue ſtirred vp
                     The flames of loue, but ruſh I was deceiu'd.
                     Then if thou wouldſt thy miſtreſſe conquer, leaue
                     Theſe ſilly toyes, and cloſe thou vp all loue.
                     Do that which loue and nature teacheth thee,
                     For modeſtie is but the outward vertue of
                     A womans face. Wherefore to handle her with modeſtie,
                     Is a meere fault, ſhe though ſhe vſe it, loues it not.
                     A tender-harted Louer ſhalt thou not

                     I will aſſaile and pierce thee through and through.
                     Twiſe haue I taken thee, and twiſe againe
                     Thou haſt eſcap'd (I know not how) my hands:

                     I'le fetter thee for running then away.
                     T'hart wont to paſſe theſe woods, I like a hound
                     Will hunt thee out. Oh what a ſweet reuenge
                     I meane to take: I meane to make thee proue
                     What t'is vniuſtly to betray thy Loue.

                     Yet neither conquered is, neither commaunds.
                     Falſe humane hopes that towre
                     And plant a ſiege to th'Elementall hill,
                     Rebellious vnto heauens will:
                     Arming poore thoughts like giant fooles againe,
                     Louers and no Louers vine.
                     VVho would haue thought loue and diſdaine blind things,
                     Should mount aboue the ſoueraigne ſtarry wings.
                     But thou that ſtandst aboue both ſtarres &amp; fate,
                     And with thy wit diuine
                     Great mouer of the skies doſt them reſtraine,
                     Behold: we thee beſeech our doubtfull ſtate
                     VVith desteny combine.
                     And fathers louing zeale, loue and diſdaine,
                     Mixe flame and frozen vaine.
                     
                        
Let them that ſhund to loue, now learne to loue,
                     Let not that other mone.
                     Ah let not others blindeſt folly thus
                     Thy gently promiſde pittie take from vs.
                     But who doth know? perhaps this ſame that ſeemes
                     An vnauoydable miſchieuous eſtate,
                     May proue right fortunate.
                     How fond a thing it is for mortall ſight
                     To ſearch into the Eternall ſunnes high light.
                  
                  An end of the firſt Act.
               
            
            
               
                  Act. 2. Scene. 1.
                  Ergasto. Mirtillo.
                  
                     HOw I haue ſearcht alongſt the riuers ſide,
                     About the meadowes, fountains, and the hils,
                     To find thee out: which now I haue, the gods be praiſ'd.
                  
                  
                     Mir.
                     Ah that thy newes Ergasto may deſerue
                     This haſte. But bringſt thou life or death?
                  
                  
                     Er.
                     This though I had I would not giue it thee.
                     That do I hope to giue thee, though I haue it not
                     As yet. But fie, thou muſt not ſuffer griefe
                     To ouerthrow thy ſences thus. Liue man and hope.
                     But to the purpoſe of my comming now,
                     
                        Ormino hath a ſiſter, knowſt her not?
                     A tall big wench, a merry-countnaun'ſt Nymphe
                     With yealow haire, ſomewhat high-coloured.
                  
                  
                     Mir.
                     What is her name?
                  
                  
                     Er.
                     Coriſca.
                  
                  
                     Mir
                     
                        I know her well,
                     And heretofore haue ſpoke with her.
                  
                  
                     Er.
                     Then know that ſhe (and ſee withall your lucke)
                     Is now become (I know not by what priuiledge)
                     Companion to your beauteous Amarillis.
                     
                     I haue diſcouered all your loue to her,
                     And this which you deſire, and readily
                     She me hath giu'n her faith to bring't about.
                  
                  
                     Mir.
                     O happie Mirtillo if this ſame proue true:
                     But ſaid ſhe nothing of the meanes whereby?
                  
                  
                     Er.
                     Nothing as yet, nor would ſhe that conclude
                     Vntill ſhe knew the manner of your loue.
                     
                        
How it began, and what hath hapt therein,
                     That ſhe might eaſilier ſpie into the hart
                     Of your beloued Nymphe, and better know
                     How to diſpoſe by praiers or by fraud
                     Of her requeſt. For this I came to you,
                     And make me now acquainted from the head,
                     With all the hiſtorie of your deare Loue.
                  
                  
                     Mir.
                     So will I do, but yet Ergasto know
                     This memorie (a bitter hopeleſſe thing)
                     Is like a fire-brand toſſed in the winde,
                     By which how much the fire increaſeth ſtill,
                     So much the brand with blazing flame conſumes
                     O piercing ſhaft made by ſome power diuine!
                     The which the more we ſeeke to draw it out,
                     The faſter hold it takes, the deeper roote.
                     Well can I tell you, that theſe Louers hopes
                     Are full of vanities and falſhoods ſtill,
                     Loues fruit is bitter, though the roote be ſweet.
                     In that ſweet time when dayes aduantage get
                     Aboue the nights, then when the yeare begins:
                     This daintie pilgrim, beauties bright new ſunne,
                     Came with her count'nance like another ſpring,
                     T'illumin
                           •
                        te my then thriſe happie ſoyle
                     Of Piſa, and Eglidis faire. Brought by her mother
                     To ſee the ſacrifices and the ſports
                     That celebrated in thoſe ſolemne daies
                     Were vnto loue. Where while ſhe ment to make
                     Her eye-ſight bleſt with that ſame ſpectacle,
                     She bleſt the ſpectacle with her faire eyes,
                     Being loues greateſt miracle beneath the skies.
                     No ſooner had I ſcene that face, but ſtraight
                     
                        I burnt, defending not the formoſt looke,
                     Which though mine eies into my breſt directed
                     Such an imperious beautie, as me thought did ſay,
                     
                        Mirtillo yeeld thy hart for it is mine.
                  
                  
                     Er.
                     Oh in our breſts what mighty power hath loue?
                     Ther's none can tell, ſaue they the ſame which proue
                  
                  
                     
                     Mir.
                     See how induſtrious loue can worke eu'n in
                     The ſimpleſt breſts. A ſiſter which I had
                     
                        I made acquainted with my thoughts, who was
                     By chaunce companion to my cruell Nymphe.
                     The time ſhe ſtaid in Piſa and Elide,
                     
                     Shee faithfull counſell, and good aide me gaue,
                     She dreſt me finely in one of her gownes,
                     Circling my temples with a periwig,
                     Which gracefully ſhe trimmed vp with flowres.
                     A quiuer and a bowe hung at my ſide,
                     She taught me furthermore to faine my voice
                     And lookes, for in my face as then there grew no haire.
                     This done, ſhe me conducted where the Nimphe
                     Was wont to ſport her ſelfe, and where we found
                     A noble troupe of maydens of Megara,
                     
                     By blood or loue allyed to my goddeſſe.
                     Mongſt them ſhe ſtood like to a princely Roſe,
                     Among a heape of humble Violets.
                     We had not long bene there before vproſe
                     One of the maydens of Megara, and thus beſpake.
                     Why ſtand we idly ſtill in ſuch a time,
                     When plames and famous trophees are ſo riſe?
                     Haue not we armes counterfait fights to make
                     As well as men? Siſters be rulde by mee:
                     Let's proue among our ſelues our armes in ieſt,
                     That when we come to earneſt them with men,
                     We may them better vſe. Let's kiſſe, and ſtriue
                     Who can kiſſe ſweetlieſt among our ſelues:
                     And let this garland be the victors gaine.
                     All at the propoſition laught: and all
                     Vnto it ſtrait agreed. Straightway began
                     A fight confuſed, no ſignall we attended.
                     Which by her ſeene that firſt ordaind the ſport,
                     She ſaies againe. Let's make her worthy iudge
                     That hath the faireſt mouth. All ſoone agreed,
                     And Amarillis choſe. Who ſweetly bowing downe,
                     Her beauteous eyes in modeſt bluſhing ſtand,
                     Did ſhow they were as faire within as th'were without.
                     
                        
Or that her face her, rich-clad mouth enuyed,
                     And would be cloath'd in pompous purple too,
                     As who ſhould ſay, I am as faire as it.
                  
                  
                     Er.
                     In good time did you chaunge into a Nymphe,
                     A happy token of good lucke to come.
                  
                  
                     Mir.
                     Now did the beautious iudge ſit in her plate,
                     According as the Megarence preſcrib'd.
                     Each went by lot to make due proofe of her
                     Rare mouth, that heauenly paragon of ſweetneſſe.
                     That bleſſed mouth that may be likened to
                     A perfum'd Indian ſhell of orientall pearle,
                     Op'ning the daintie treaſure, mixt with hony ſweet
                     And purple bluſh. I cannot (my Ergaſto) tell
                     Th'inexplicable ſweetneſſe which I felt
                     Out of that kiſſe. But looke what Cypres caues
                     Or hiues of Hybla haue, are nothing all
                     Compar'd with that which then I taſted there.
                  
                  
                     Er.
                     Oh happy theft ſweet kiſſe.
                  
                  
                     Mir.
                     Yea ſweet,
                     But yet not gracious, for it wanted ſtill
                     The better part: loue gaue it, but loue not
                     Return'd it backe.
                  
                  
                     Er.
                     But then how did you
                     When it was your lot to kiſſe?
                  
                  
                     Mir.
                     Vnto thoſe lips
                     My ſoule did wholy flie, and all my life
                     So ſhut therein, as in a litle ſpace
                     It waxed nothing but a kiſſe. And all
                     My other limmes ſtood ſtrenghleſſe trembling ſtill,
                     When I approached to her lightning lookes,
                     Knowing my deed was theft and deceit,
                     I feared the maieſtie of her faire face,
                     But ſhe aſſures me with a pleaſing ſmile:
                     And puts me forward more, loue ſitting like
                     A Bee vpon two freſh and daintie Roſes cloſe.
                     Kiſſing, I taſted there the honey ſweet,
                     But hauing kiſt, I felt the louely Bee
                     Strike through my hart with his ſharp piercing ſting.
                     And being wounded thus, halfe deſperate,
                     
                        I thought t'haue bitten thoſe manſlaught'ring lips,
                     But that her odoriferous breath like aire diuine,
                     
                        
Wak'ned my modeſtie and ſtill my rage.
                  
                  
                     Er.
                     This modeſtie moleſteth Louers ſtill.
                  
                  
                     Mir.
                     Now were the lotts fulfild, and eu'ry one
                     With heedfull minds the ſentence did attend:
                     When Amarillis iudging mine the beſt,
                     With her owne hands ſhe crownes my treſſes, with
                     The gentle garland kept for victorie.
                     But neuer was ſhadeleſſe meadow drier parcht,
                     Vnder the balefull fury of the heauenly dog,
                     Then was my hart in ſunſhine of that ſweet,
                     Neuer ſo vanquiſht as in victory.
                     Yet had I power to take the garland off,
                     And reach it her, ſaying to you belongs
                     Alone the ſame. T'is due to you, that made
                     Mine good, by vertue of your mouth.
                     She gently took't and crownd her ſelfe therewith.
                     And with an other that ſhe ware crownd mine.
                     T's this I weare thus dried as you ſee,
                     It will I carry to my graue with mee.
                     In deare remembraunce of that happie day.
                     But more for ſigne of my dead hopes decay.
                  
                  
                     Er.
                     Thou pittie more then enuy doſt deſerue,
                     That wert another Tantalus in loues delights,
                     That of a ſport a torment true didſt make.
                     Thou pai'ſt too deare for thy ſtolne delicates.
                     But did ſhe ere perceiue thy pollicies?
                  
                  
                     Mir.
                     That know I not (Ergaſto) yet thus much I know,
                     That in the time ſhe made Elidis bleſt
                     With her ſweet count'nance, ſhe liberall was
                     Of pleaſing lookes to mee. But thereof did
                     My cruell fates robbe me ſo ſodeinly,
                     That I perceiu'd it not till they were gone.
                     Whē I drawne by the power of her beauteous looke
                     Leauing my home came hither, where thou knowſt
                     My father had this poore habitacle.
                     But now the day that with ſo faire a ſpring began,
                     Come to his weſtern bound, thunders &amp; lightēs out,
                     Ah then I ſaw theſe were true ſignes of death.
                     
                        
Now had (alas) my tender father felt,
                     My not-foreſeene departure, and orecome
                     With griefe, fell ſicke nigh hand to death,
                     Whereby I was conſtrained to returne.
                     Ah that returne prooued the fathers health,
                     But deadly ſickneſſe to the ſonne: for in ſhort time
                     I languiſhed and pined quite away.
                     Which held me from the time the ſunne had left
                     The bull, vntill his entry into Capricorne.
                     
                     And ſo had ſtill, had not my pitious father ſought
                     For counſaile to the Oracle, which ſaid,
                     Onely Arcadia could reſtore my health.
                     So I returnd to ſee her that can heale
                     My bodies griefe (O Oracles falſe lye)
                     But makes my ſoule ſicke euerlaſtingly.
                  
                  
                     Er.
                     Strange tale thou telſt (Mirtillo) though't be true.
                     The onely health to one that's deſperate,
                     Is to diſpaire of health. And now t'is time
                     I goe communicate with our Coriſca.
                     
                     Go to the fountaine you, there ſtay for me,
                     Ile make what haſte I can.
                  
                  
                     Mir.
                     Goe happily,

                     The dales, the mountaines, I haue ſought with care,
                     All weary now I am. Curſt be the beaſt
                     Thou didſt purſue. But ſee a Nymphe, perhaps

                     Nymphe, I Melampo came to ſeeke, not to looſe time,

                     Both dog and doe are in my power.

                     Do.
                     Why doth it grieue you then
                     That I them hold that do adore you ſo?

                     Do.
                     See wau'ring child, am I not fortunate?
                     When a beaſt and a dogge can make me deare to thee.
                  
                  
                     Sil.
                     Good reaſon too, but yet her Ile deceiue.

                        I want no apples, and perhaps I could
                     Thee better-taſted giue; didſt thou not thus
                     Diſdaine my gifts.

She is an aſſe that it beleeues. Ile not beleeu't.
                     But ſee how Fortune fauours me: Behold
                     Where Amarillis is her ſelfe. Ile make
                     As though I ſawe her not, and ſtand aſide.

                  Amarillis. Coriſca.
                  
                     DEare bleſſed woods, and you the ſilent groues
                     Of reſt and peace, the harbour-houſes true:
                     How willingly I turne to viſit you.
                     And if my ſtarres had ſo bene pleaſde t'haue let
                     Me liue vnto my ſelfe, I with th'elizian fields
                     The happie gardeins of the demy gods,
                     Wou'd not haue chang'd your gentle ſhadow ſpots.
                     If I iudge right, theſe worldly goods are nought
                     But muſchiefes, ſtill the richeſt haue leaſt goods,
                     And he poſſeſſeth moſt that is moſt poore.
                     Riches are euer ſnares of libertie.
                     What's fame of beautie worth in tender yeares?
                     Or heauenly nobleneſſe in mortall blood?
                     So many fauours, both of heauen and earth,
                     Fields large, and happie, goodly meadow plaines,
                     Fat paſtures, that do fatter flocks preſent,
                     If in the ſame the hart be not content.
                     Happie that ſhepheardeſſe, whoſe ſcarcely knees,
                     A poore, but yet a cleanly gowne doth reach:
                     Rich in her ſelfe, onely in natures gifts.
                     Who in ſweet pouertie, no pooreneſſe knowes:
                     Nor feeles no tortures which this 
                           •
                        iches brings.
                     Deſire to haue much, nere doth her torment,
                     If ſhe be poore, yet is ſhe well content.
                     She natures gifts doth nurſe with natures gifts,
                     Making milke ſpring with milke, ſaucing her natiue ſweet
                     With hony of the Bee, one fountaine ſerueth her
                     To drinke, to waſh, and for her looking glaſſe.
                     If ſhe be well, then all the world is well.
                     Let the cloudes riſe, and thunder threat amaine,
                     Her pouertie doth all the feare preuent,
                     
                        
If ſhe be poore, yet is ſhe well content.
                     Finely the flocke committed to her charge
                     Feeds on the graſſe, the whilſt her ſhepheard friend
                     Feeds on her eyes, not whom the ſtarres, or men,
                     Her deſtenies, but whom affection chooſeth.
                     Then in the ſhadow of a M
                           ••
                        tell tree,
                     Cheriſht, ſhe cheriſheth againe; nor doth
                     She feele that heat which ſhe diſcouers not:
                     Nor euer heat diſcouer which ſhe doth not feele.
                     Alwaies declaring troth of her intent,
                     If ſhe be poore, yet is ſhe well content.
                     True life that knowes not death before they die.
                     Ah that I might my fortune chaunge with theirs.
                     But ſee Coriſca. Gods ſaue you good Coriſca.

                     And is ſhe gone and left her head behind?
                     Vnuſuall wonder. Nimphs and ſhepheards come,

                     Thou art without a head that ſeeſt not

                     Thy face, thy words, thy laughter and thy lookes,

                     I will go proue to make againe as vile.

                     Great was her fault and errour ſure,
                     That did occaſion all our teene:
                     Who loues great lawes holy and pure
                     (Breaking her faith) did violate
                     And thereby did illuminate
                     The mortall rage of our immortall queene.
                     
                     That neither teares nor blood
                     Of many harmleſſe ſoules haue done vs good.
                     So faith to euery vertue roote
                     The ornament of euery ſoule well borne,
                     In heauen hath ſurely ſet his foote,

                     Eu'n for the true almightie makers ſake.
                     Blind mortalls you that haue ſo deep deſire
                     To get and to poſſeſſe
                     A guilded carkaſſe of a painted tire,
                     That like a naked ſhadow walkes on ſtill,
                     Seeking her ſepulchre by geſſe:
                     What loue, or rather fond will,
                     Hath witcht your hart dead beautie to purſue?
                     Rich treaſures are loues follies found. The true
                     And liuely loue is of the ſoule:
                     All other ſubiects want what loue requires,
                     Therfore they not deſerue theſe amorous deſires.
                     The ſoule becauſe it onely loues againe,
                     Is onely worthie of this louing paine.
                     It is a pretie thing to kiſſe
                     The delicate vermilion Roſe
                     Of ſome faire cheeke, they that haue prou'd that bliſſe
                     (Right happie Louers) ſo will ſay. Yet thoſe
                     Will ſay againe kiſſes are dead and vaine,
                     Where beautie kist reſtores it not againe.
                     The ſtrokes of two inamour'd lips are thoſe
                     Where mouth on mouth loues ſweeteſt vengeance ſhowes.
                     Thoſe are true kiſſes where with equall wills
                     We euer giue and take againe our fills.
                     Kiſſe but a curious mouth, a daintie hand,
                     A breaſt, a brow, or what you can demand,
                     You will confeſſe no part in woman is,
                     Saue for ſweet mouth that doth deſerue a kiſſe,
                     By which two ſoules with liuely ſpirits meet,
                     Making liue rubres kindly entergreet,
                     So mongſt themſelues thoſe ſowly ſprightfull kiſſes
                     
                        
Do enter-speake, and in a little ſowne
                     Great things bewray, and ſweeteſt ſecret bliſſes
                     To others hidden, to themſelues well knowne.
                     Such ioy, nay ſuch ſweet life doth louing proue,
                     Soule knit to ſoule by th'earthly knot of loue.
                     Kiſſes that kiſſes meet, do paint vnmou'd,
                     Th'incounters of two harts, louing belou'd.

                     O Spring, the gentle childhood of the yeare,
                     Mother of floures, freſh hearbs, &amp; freſh deſires,
                     Thou turn'ſt againe, but with thee do not turne
                     The happie dayes of my delightfull ioyes:
                     Thou turnſt, thou turnſt, but with thee turnſt nought elſe
                     Saue of the loſſe of my deare truſures lorne,
                     The miſerable wretched memorie.
                     Thou art the ſame thou wert, ſo freſh, ſo faire,
                     But I am not as I was wont to be,
                     So deare to other eyes. Oh bitter ſweets of loue,
                     Much worſer t'is to leeſe you once poſſeſt,
                     Then neuer to haue you enioy'd at all,
                     Much like the griefe to chaunge a happie ſtate.
                     The memorie of any good that waſts,
                     Conſumes it ſelfe as th'other is conſum'd.
                     But if my hopes be not as is their vſe,
                     Of brittle glaſſe, or that my deep deſire
                     Make not my hope much greater then the truth,
                     Here ſhall I ſee the ſun-beames of mine eyes.
                     Here if I be not mockt I ſhall her ſee
                     Stay her quick feete at ſound of my lament.
                     Here ſhall my greedie eyes after long faſt
                     Receiue ſweet foode from her diuineſt looke.
                     Here will ſhe turne her ſon'raigne lights on mee,
                     If not gentle, yet cruell will they bee.
                     If not the meanes to breed mine inward ioy,
                     So 
                           •
                        ierce, yet as I die to mine annoy.
                     O happie day ſigh'd for long time in vaine,
                     
                        
If after times ſo clouded with complaints
                     Loue thou doſt graunt me ſight of her faire eies,
                     I meane made bright as is the morning Sun,
                     Hither Ergasto ſent me, where he ſaid
                     
                        Coriſca and my beauteous Amarillo
                     
                     Would be together playing at blind man buffe:
                     Yet here ſee I none blind, ſaue my blind will,
                     That wandring ſeekes her ſight by other meanes
                     But findes it not. O poyſon to my food,
                     This long delay blindeth my heart with feare.
                     My cruell deſteny will neuer chaunge.
                     Each houre, each moment that a Louer ſtaies
                     Expecting his contentment, ſeemes a world.
                     But who doth know? perhaps I ſtaid too long.
                     And here Coriſca hath attended mee.
                     Ay me! If this be true, then welcome death.

                     Either your crueltie or elſe my fate
                     A ſtarued Louer iſſuing from thoſe woods
                     Where I haue ſuffered long and wretched faſt,
                     Haue for my health aſſaid this ſtratage me
                     Which loues neceſſitie vpon me thruſt.
                     Now blame not me (Nimph cruell) blame your ſelfe,
                     For praiers and conceits true loues diſcretion
                     As you them call, you not attend from me,
                     You haue bereau'd with ſhunning me the meanes
                     To loue diſcreetly.
                  
                  
                     Ama.
                     Diſcreetly might you to do
                     To leaue to follow that which flies you ſo,
                     In vaine you know you do purſue me ſtill.
                     What is't you ſeeke of me?
                  
                  
                     Mir.
                     Onely one time
                     Daine but to heare me, ere I wretched die.
                  
                  
                     Ama.
                     T's well for you, the fauour that you aske
                     You haue alreadie had: now get you hence.
                  
                  
                     Mir.
                     Ah Nimph that which I haue already ſaid,
                     Is but a drop of that huge ample ſea
                     Of my complaints, if not for pittie ſake,
                     Yet for your pleaſure now heare (cruell) but
                     The lateſt accents of a dying voice.
                  
                  
                     Ama.
                     To eaſe your mind and me this cumber rid,
                     I graunt to heare you, but with this condition,
                     Speake ſmall, part ſoone, and neuer turne againe.
                  
                  
                     Mir.
                     In too too ſmall a bundle (cruell Nimphe)
                     You do ccommaund me binde my huge deſires,
                     Which meaſure, but by thought nought could containe:
                     That I you loue, and loue more then life,
                     If you deny to know, aske but theſe woods
                     And they will tell, and tell you with them will
                     Their beaſts, their trees &amp; ſtones of theſe great rocks
                     Which I ſo oft haue tender made to melt
                     At found of my complaints. But what make I
                     
                     Such proofe of loue where ſuch rare beautie is?
                     See but how many beauteous things the skies containe,
                     
                        
How many dreſſe the earth in braue attire:
                     Thence ſhall you ſee the force of my deſire.
                     For as the waters fall, the fire doth riſe,

                     Eu'n ſo to you as to their chiefeſt good,
                     My ſoule doth flie, and my poore thoughts do run
                     With all affection to your louely beauties:
                     He that from their deare obiect would them turne,
                     Might faſt turne from their viuall courſe the skie,
                     The earth, the ayre, the water, and the fire.
                     And quite remooue the earth from oft his ſeate.
                     But why commaund you me to ſpeake but ſmall?
                     Small ſhall I tell, it I but tell you ſhall
                     That I muſt die, and leſſe ſhall dying doo,
                     If I but ſee what is my turne too.
                     Ay me, what ſhall I do? which may out-laſt
                     My miſerable loue? When I am dead,
                     Yet cruell ſoule haue pitie on my paines.
                     Ah faire! ah deare I ſometime ſo ſweete a cauſe
                     Why I did liue whilſt my good fates were pleaſd.

                     Let me them ſee once meeke and full of pitie
                     Before I die. So may my death be ſweet.
                     As they haue bene good guide, vnto my life,

                     Ah wicked loue, this is a miſerie extreame,
                     A Nymph ſo cruell ſo deſirous of my death,
                     Becauſe I aske it as a fauour, ſcornes to giue it,
                     
                        
Arming her cruell voyce in ſilence ſo,
                     Leaſt it might fauour mine exceeding wo.
                  
                  
                     Ama.
                     If I as well to anſwere as to heare,
                     You pronuſ'd had, iuſt cauſe you might haue found
                     To haue condemn'd my ſilence for vniuſt.
                     You call me cruell, imagining perhaps
                     By that reproofe more eaſily to drawe
                     Me to the contrary. No know (Mirtillo)
                     
                     I am no more delighted with the ſound
                     Of that deſertleſſe and diſliked praiſe
                     You to my beautie giue, then diſcontent
                     To heare you call me cruell and vniuſt.
                     I graunt this crueltie to any elſe a fault,
                     But to a louer vertue t's and honeſtie,
                     Which in a woman you call crueltie.
                     But be it as you you'd blame-worthy fault,
                     To be vnkinde to one that loues. Tell me,
                     When was Amarillis cruell vnto you?
                     Perhaps when reaſon would not giue me leaue
                     To vſe this pitie: yet how I it vſ'd
                     Your ſelfe can iudge, when you from death I ſau'd:
                     I meane when you among a noble ſort of maides,
                     A luſtfull Louer in a womans cloathes
                     Banded your ſelfe, and durſt contaminate
                     Their pureſt ſports, mingling mong kiſſes innocent,
                     Kiſſes laſciuious and impure: which to remember
                     I am aſham'd. But heauens my witneſſe are,
                     I knew you not, and after I you knew,
                     I ſcornd your deed, and kept my ſoule vntoucht
                     From your laſciuiouſneſſe, not ſuffering at all
                     The venome there to runne to my chaſte heart.
                     You violated nothing ſaue th'out ſide
                     Of theſe my lips. A mouth kiſt but by force
                     Spits out the kiſſe, and kill the ſhame withall.
                     But tell me you, what fruite had you receiu'd
                     Of your raſh theft, had I diſcouered you
                     Vnto thoſe Nymphes? The Thracian Orfeus had not bene
                     So lamentably torne on Ebers bankes
                     
                        
Of Bacchus dames as you had bene of them,
                     Had not you help't, her pittie whom you cruell call.
                     That pittie which was fit for me to giue, I euer gaue:
                     For other t'is in vaine you either aske or hope:
                     If you me loue, then loue mine honeſtie,
                     My ſafetie loue, and loue my life withall.
                     Thou art too farre from that which thou deſir'ſt,
                     The heauens forbid, the earth contraries it,
                     Death is the puniſhment thereof. And aboue all
                     Mine honeſtie deſies forbidden acts:
                     Then with a ſafer keeper of her honours floure,
                     A ſoule well-borne will euer ſcorne to haue.
                     Then reſt in peace (Mirtillo) giue ore this ſuite,
                     Get thee farre hence to liue if thou art bee'ſt wiſe.
                     T'abandon life for peeuiſh griefe or ſmart,
                     Is not the action of a valiant hart.
                     From that which pleaſeth vertue, t'is t'abſtaine,
                     Is that which pleaſeth breeds offence againe.

                     Ama.
                     A new deſire an old will quite diſplace.
                  
                  
                     Mir.
                     Had I another hart, another ſoule.
                  
                  
                     Ama.
                     Time will at laſt clearly this loue conſume.

                     I after loue hath quite conſum'd my life.
                  
                  
                     Ama.
                     Why then your wounds will not be cur'd at all?
                  
                  
                     Mir.

                     Till death▪ well heare mee now,
                     And looke my words be lawes vnto your deeds.
                     Howbee't I know to die is the more vſuall voice
                     Of an inamour'd tongue, then a deſire
                     Or firme conceit his ſoule hath entertain'd,

Death to mine honour as vnto thy life.

                     Find end vnto my torment and my griefe?

                     Well now t'is time you go (Mirtillo) hence!
                     Yow'le ſtay too long. Go comfort your ſelfe,
                     That infinit the troupe of wretched Louers is.
                     All wounds do bring with them their ſeuerall paine,
                     Nor can you onely of this loue complaine.

                     Of dead and liuing, nor can liue nor die.
                  
                  
                     Ama.
                     Well go your waies.

                     Ah ſad departure,
                     End of my life, go I from you, and do not die?
                     And yet I feele the verie pangs of death,
                     That do giue life vnto mine exttaſie,

                     OH Mirtillo! oh my deareſt ſoule
                     Could'ſt thou but ſee into her hart whom thou
                     Call'ſt cruell Amarillis, then wouldſt thou ſay
                     Thou hadſt that pittie which thy hart deſires.
                     Oh mindes too much infortunate in loue!
                     What bootes it thee my hart to be belou'd?
                     What bootes it me to haue ſo deare a Loue?
                     Why ſhould the cruell ſates ſo diſvnite
                     Whō loue conioines? and why ſhould traiterous loue
                     Conioyne them whom the deſtenies do part?
                     Oh happie ſauadge beaſts whom nature giues
                     No lawes in loue, ſaue verie loue it ſelfe.
                     Inhumane humane lawe, that puniſh'ſt
                     This loue with death, if't be ſo ſweet to ſin,

Imperfect nature that repugneth law,
                     Or law too hard that nature doth offend.
                     But ruſh, ſhe loues too litle that feares death,
                     Would gods death were the worſt that's due to ſin.
                     Deare chaſtitie, th'inviolable powre
                     Of ſoules well-borne that haſt my amorous will

                     Doth ſeeme thy foe, but in my heart thy friend.
                     If thou wouldſt be reueng'd, what greater paine
                     Wouldſt thou 
                           〈◊〉

                     And all thy paines they are not onely thine,
                     For I them feele, and they are turned mine.

                     And now I ſee too weake a thing doth proue

                     Do you not know I am eſpowſ'd to Siluio,
                     
                     And that the law each woman doomes to death

                     Oh ſimple foole,
                     Is this the let? Which is more auncient among vs,
                     
                        Dianaes lawe or loues? this in our breaſts
                     Is bred and growes with vs, Nature her ſelfe

                     And where this law commands, both heau'n &amp; earth obey.
                  
                  
                     Ama.
                     But if the other law do take my life,
                     How can loues lawe reſtore it me againe?

                     Small practiſers are ſubiect to this paine.
                     The lawe doth neuer ſtretch vnto the wiſe.
                     Beleeue me ſhould blame-worthy all be ſlaine,
                     The countre then would ſoone prooue womanleſſe.
                     It needfull was, theft ſhould forbidden bee
                     To them that cloſely could not couer theft.
                     This honeſtie is but an art to ſeeme ſo,
                     Let others as they liſt beleeue, Ile thinke ſo ſtill.

                     Theſe are but vanities (Coriſca) t'were beſt

                     And who forbids thee foole? This life's too ſhort
                     To paſſe it ouer with one onely loue:
                     Men are too ſparing of then fauours now,
                     (Whether't be for want, or elſe for frowardneſſe

                     Let men prate on they do not feele our woes,
                     For their condition differs much from ours,
                     The elder that they grow, they grow the perfecteſt:
                     If they looſe beautie, yet they wiſedome gaine:
                     
                     But when our beautie fades that oftentimes
                     Conquers their greateſt witts, ſtraight fadeth all our good,
                     There cannot be a vilder thing to ſee
                     Then an old woman. Therfore ere thou age attaine,
                     Know me thy ſelfe, and vſe it as thou ſhouldſt.
                     What were a Lion worth did he not vſe his ſtrength?
                     What's a mans wit worth that lies idly by?
                     Eu'n ſo our beautie proper ſtrength to vs,
                     As force to Lyons, wiſedome vnto men,
                     We ought to vſe whilſt it we haue. Time flies
                     Away and yeares come on, our youth once loſt
                     We like cut flowres neuer grow freſh againe.
                     And to our hoary haires loue well may runne,

                     New ſorts of paine, a cruell mind behold
                     Included in a looke moſt mercifull,

                     Becauſe my death cannot ſuffice to glut

                     Ile make as though I heard him not, I heare
                     A lamentable voyce plaine hereabouts,
                     I wonder who it is, oh my Mirtillo.

                     So would I were a naked ſhade or duſt.

                     How feele you now your ſelfe after your long
                     
                        
Diſcourſe with your ſo dearely loued Nymph?
                  
                  
                     Mir.
                     Like a weake ſick man that hath long deſir'd
                     Forbidden drinke, at laſt gets it vnto his mouth
                     And drinks his death, ending at once both life &amp; thirſt.
                     So I long ſicke, burn't and conſumed in
                     This amorous drought, frō two faire fountains that
                     Ice do diſtill from out a rockie braine
                     Of an indurate heart,
                     Haue drunke the poyſon that my life will kill,
                     Sooner then halfe of my deſire fulfill.

                     So much more mightie waxeth loue as from
                     Our hearts the force is he receiues (deare Mirtillo)
                     For as the Beare is wont with licking to giue ſhape
                     To her miſhapen brood, that elſe were helpleſſe borne.
                     Eu'n ſo a Louer to his bare deſire,
                     That in the birth was ſhapeleſſe, weake and fraile.
                     Giuing but forme and ſtrength begetteth loue:
                     Which whilſt t'is young and tender, then t'is ſweet,
                     But waxing to more yeares, more cruell growes,
                     That in the end (Mirtillo) an mueterate affect
                     Is euer full of anguiſh and defect.
                     For whilſt the mind on one thought onely beates;
                     It waxeth thicke by being too much fixt.
                     So loue that ſhould be pleaſure and delight,
                     Is turn'd to malancholy, and what worſer is,
                     It proues at laſt, or death, or madneſſe at the leaſt:
                     Wherefore wiſe is that heart that often changeth loue.

                     Ere I change will or thought, chang'd muſt my life
                     Be into death, for though the beautious Amarillis
                     
                     Be moſt cruell, yet is ſhe all my life:
                     Nor can this bodies bulke at once containe
                     More then one heart, more then one ſoule retaine.

This onely reſts amongſt my many griefes.
                     My ſole content doth my heart burne or die,
                     Or languiſh ne're ſo much, light are the paines,
                     Plaints, torments, ſighes, exile, and death it ſelfe,
                     For ſuch a cauſe, for ſuch a ſweet reſpect.
                     That life before my faith ſhall broken bee,
                     So worſe then death I hold inconſtancie.

                     More mortall poyſon to a ſoule in loue.
                     Then is this faith. Vnhappie is that heart

                     Tell me poore man with this thy fooliſh vertue of conſtancie,

                     The reward thou doſt not hope for? if thou deem'ſt right,
                     Thou lou'ſt thine ill, thy grief, thy very death,

                     Nor though I could I would not.
                     And if I thought in any time henceforth

                     If one could loue a moſt vnlouely Beaſt,

                     Could mooue his loue, perhaps this beaſtes yet mought.

                     I that each thing of Siluio held full deare,
                     Shade of his ſhape, and footſteps of his feete,
                     Much more the Dogge which he ſo dearely lou'd,
                     Him ſtraightway tooke, and hee without adoo,

                     Oh blindly done, blind Prophets to beleeue,
                     The fathers and the ſtanders by were glad,
                     And wept, their hartes made tender with this ioye.
                     
                        Titirus was no ſooner gone, but ſtraight we heard
                     And ſaw vnhappy fearefull ſignes, the meſſengers
                     Of ſacredire: at which ſo ſodaine and ſo fierce,
                     Each ſtood amaz'd, the Prieſtes incloſed were
                     VVithin the greater Cloyſture, we without,
                     VVeeping were ſaying holy pray'res, when loe
                     The wicked Satyre audience earneſt craues
                     Of the chiefe Prieſt: and for this was my charge,
                     I let him in, to whom he thus begins,
                     Fathers, if to your Vowes the Incenſe and
                     The Sacrifizes be not anſwerable,
                     If on your Aulters purely burne no flames,
                     Woonder not, for in Ericinaes Caue,
                     A treacherous Nimph prophanes your holy Lawes:
                     And in adultry her fayth doth breake.
                     Come Miniſters with me, wee'le take in the fact.
                     A while th' vnhappy father breathes, thinking he had
                     Found out the cauſe of this ſo diſmall ſignes,
                     Straight he commaundes chiefe Miniſter Nacander go
                     
                        
With that ſame Satyre, and captiud to bring
                     Them to the Temple both: him ſtraight accompanied
                     With all our troupe of vnder Miniſters,
                     The Satyre by a darke and crooked way,
                     Conductes into the Caue: the young-man ſcar'd
                     Without torch-light, ſo ſodainely aſſail'd:
                     Aſſayes to fly vnto that outward iſſue,
                     But it the Satyre cloſed hath too faſt.
                  
                  
                     Cho.
                     What did you then?
                  
                  
                     Er.
                     I can not tell you how
                     Amaz'd we were, to ſee her that we taken had,
                     To be Titirus daughter, whom no ſooner we
                     Had layd hold on, but out Mirtillo ſteps,
                     And throwes his Dart, thinking to wound Nicander:
                     
                     And had the ſteele hit as he did direct,
                     
                        Nicander had been ſlaine: but ſhrinking backe,
                     Whether by chaunce or wit, he ſhund the harme:
                     But the ſtrong Dart pierced his hayrie cloathes,
                     And there ſtucke faſt, Mirtillo not being able
                     It to recouer, captiue taken was.
                  
                  
                     Cho.
                     What's come of him?
                  
                  
                     Er.
                     He by an other way is led.
                  
                  
                     Cho.
                     VVhat ſhall he do?
                  
                  
                     Er.
                     To get more out of him,
                     Beſides, perhaps he ſhall not skotfree ſcape:
                     For hauing ſo offended our high Prieſt,
                     Yet would I could haue comforted the wretch.
                  
                  
                     Cho.
                     Why could you not?
                  
                  
                     Er.
                     Becauſe the Law forbids
                     Vs vnder Miniſters to ſpeake with gultie folkes:
                     For this I came about, and left the reſt,
                     Prouoking heauens with teares and prayers deuout,
                     To turne away this dreadfull ſtorme from vs:
                     And ſo pray yee, and therewithall farewell.

                     So ſhall we do, had we but once performd
                     Our duetie vnto Siluio, eternall Gods
                     In pittie, not in furie, ſhew your ſelues ſupreame.

                     NOw crowne my temples with triumphant Bayes,
                     Victorious ten ples, this day happely
                     
                        
I combated haue in the field of Loue,
                     And vanquiſhed: this day both heauen and earth,
                     Nature and Art, Fortune and Deſtenie,
                     Both friendes and enemies haue fought for mee.
                     The wicked Satyre whom I hated ſo,
                     Hath helpt me much: for it was better that
                     
                        Mirtillo ſhould, then Coridon, be ta'ne,
                     To make her fault more likely and more ill:
                     VVhat though Mirtillo taken be, hee'le ſoone be free,
                     To her alone the puniſhment is due.
                     O ſolemne victorie, On famous triumph,
                     Dreſſe me a Trophee amorous deceites,
                     You in this toung, in this ſame precious breſt
                     Are aboue Nature moſt omnipotent.
                     VVhy ſtay I now? t'is time for me to go,
                     Vntill the Law haue iudg'd my riuall dead,
                     Perhaps the Prieſt may draw the troth from mee:
                     Fly then Coriſea, daunger t'is to ly,
                     For them that haue no feete wherewith to fly▪
                     
                     I'le hide me in theſe woodes vntill I may
                     Returne t'enioy my ioyes: happy Coriſea,
                     
                     VVho euer ſaw a brauer enterpriſe?

                  Nicander, Amarillis.
                  
                     HEe had a hart moſt hard, or rather had
                     No hart at all, nor any humane ſence,
                     That did not pittie thee poore wretched Nimph,
                     And felt no ſorrow for thy miſerie:
                     Onely to ſee a Damſell captiuate,
                     Of heauenly countenance and ſo ſweete a face,
                     VVorthy the world ſhould to thee conſecrate
                     Temples and Sacrifices, led to the Temple
                     For a Sacrifice, ſurely t'were a thing
                     That with dry eyes I thinke none could behold:
                     But who knowes how and wherefore thou wert borne?
                     
                        Titirus daughter, Montan'es daughter in law,
                     That ſhould haue been, and that theſe two are they
                     
                        
VVhich do vphold Arcadia, and that thy ſelfe
                     A daintie Nimph, ſo faire of forme,
                     The naturall confines of this thy life,
                     Approacheſt now ſo neare the boundes of death:
                     Hee that knowes this, and doth not plaine the ſame,
                     He is no man, but beaſt, in humane ſhape.
                  
                  
                     Am.
                     If that my fault did cauſe my wretchedneſſe,
                     Or that my thoughtes were wicked, as thou thinkſt
                     My deed, leſſe greeuous would my death be then:
                     For it were iuſt my blood ſhould waſh the ſpots
                     Of my defiled ſoule, heauens rage appeaſe,
                     And humane iuſtice iuſtly ſatisfie,
                     Then could I quiet my afflicted ſprights,
                     And with a iuſt remorſe of well-deſerued death,
                     My ſenſes mortifie, and come to death:
                     And with a quiet blow paſſe foorth perhaps
                     Vnto a life of more tranquilitie:
                     But too too much Nicander too much grieu'd
                     I am, in ſo young yeeres Fortune ſo hie,
                     An Innocent, I ſhould be doom'd to die.
                  
                  
                     Nic.
                     Ah pleaſd it heauens we had gainſt thee offended,
                     Not thou offended gainſt the heauenly powers:
                     For we alas with greater caſe might haue
                     Reſtor'd thee to thy violated name,
                     Then thou appeaſd their violated powers:
                     But I ſee not who thee offended hath,
                     Sauing thy ſelfe. Tell me? wert thou not found
                     In a cloſe place with the Adulterer, alone
                     With him alone? Wer't thou not promiſed
                     Vnto Montanus ſonne? Haſt thou not broke thy fayth?
                     How art thou innocent?
                  
                  
                     Am.
                     I haue not broke
                     The Law, and I am innocent.
                  
                  
                     Ni.
                     Thou haſt not broke
                     The law of Nature happely (Loue if thou likeſt)
                     But humane law and heauens thou haſt tranſgreſt,
                     (Loue lawfully.)
                  
                  
                     Am.
                     Both heauens &amp; men haue er'd to me:
                     If it be true that thence our haps do come,
                     For is it reaſon in my deſtenie,
                     I beare the paine that's due to other's faultes?
                  
                  
                     
                     Ni.
                     Peace Nimph, came vp thy toung in wilfull rage,
                     Let looſe, do not condemne the Starres, for wee
                     Our ſelues procure vs all our miſerie.
                  
                  
                     Am.
                     I none accuſe in heau'n, but my ill fates.
                     And worſe then them is ſhee, that mee deceiu'd.

                     Then blame thy ſelfe, that haſt deceiu'd thy ſelfe,
                  
                  
                     Am.
                     I was deceiu'd, but by an others fraude.

                     Am.
                     Then you I ſee condemne me for vnchaſt?

                     Yet is our natiue ſoyle ſweete vnto him
                     That hath his ſence: Nature doth make it deare,
                     Like to the Adamant, whom though the Matrinet

                     Is borne, and ſometime where it dyes; yet ſtill
                     The hidden vertue where with it beholdes,

                     Two monthes he hath been heere, and I not able to

                     To know of his returne: which anſwered thus.

                     How vaine you bee? and honeſtie gainſt loue
                     In youthfull hartes a weake defence doth proue,
                     A woman whom no match hath euer ſought,
                     Is euill guarded from this common thought.
                  
                  
                     Nun.
                     If dead he be not, or that through the ayre
                     No windes haue carried him, him might I finde:
                     But ſee him now, when leaſt I thought I ſhould:
                     O late for mee, for thee too quickly found,
                     Except the newes were better that I bring.
                  
                  
                     Ti.
                     Bringes thou the weapon that hath ſlaine my child?
                  
                  
                     Nun.
                     Not this, but leſſe: But how heard you this newes?
                  
                  
                     Ti.
                     Why liues ſhe then?
                  
                  
                     Nun.
                     Shee liues, and may do ſtill,
                     For in her choyce it is to liue or die.
                  
                  
                     Ti.
                     Oh bleſt be thou that liftes me vp from death:
                     But how is ſhe vnſafe, ſince at her choyce it is
                     To liue or die?
                  
                  
                     Nun.
                     Becauſe ſhe will not liue.
                  
                  
                     Ti.
                     Shee will not liue? What madneſſe makes her thust
                  
                  
                     Nun.
                     Anothers death: and if thou doſt not moue her,
                     Shee is ſo bent, as others ſend in vaine
                     Their praying wordes.
                  
                  
                     Ti.
                     Why ſtay we? let vs goe!
                  
                  
                     Nun.
                     What, ſoft and faire, the Temples gates are ſhut,
                     And know you not how it vnlawfull is
                     For any one ſaue ſacerdotall foote,
                     To touch the ſacred ground, vntill ſuch time
                     The Sacrifize vnto the Aulters come,
                     Adorned with the Sanctuarie rites?
                  
                  
                     
                     Ti.
                     How if ſhee'ffect her purpoſe in the while?
                  
                  
                     Nun.
                     Shee cannot, for ſhee's kept.
                  
                  
                     Ti.
                     in meane time,
                     Then tell truely how all this is come to paſſe?
                  
                  
                     Nun.
                     Thy mournefull child now come before the Prieſt
                     With lookes of feare and griefe, that teares brought foorth,
                     Not onely from vs by, but by my troth,
                     Eu'n from the pillors of the Temples ſelfe
                     And hardeſt ſtones, that ſeemd to feele the ſame,
                     Was in a trice accus'd, conuic't, condemn'd.
                  
                  
                     Ti.
                     O wretched child, and why was ſhe condemn'd?
                  
                  
                     Nun.
                     Becauſe the groundes of her defence were ſmall:
                     Beſides, a certaine Nimph, whom ſhe did call
                     In teſtimonie of her innocence,
                     Was abſent now, and none could finde her out:
                     And fearefull ſignes, and monſtrous accidents
                     Of horrour in the Temple proou'd the doubt,
                     As dolorous to vs, as ſtrange and rare,
                     Not ſeene ſince we did feele heauenly ire
                     That did reuenge Amintas loue betrayde,
                     The firſt beginning of our miſerie.
                     
                        Diana ſwet out blood, the Earth did ſhake,
                     The ſacred Caue did bellow out vnwonted howling▪
                     
                     And dire deadly cries:
                     Withall, it breath'd out ſuch a ſtinking miſt,
                     As Plutoes impare kingdome hath no worſe.
                     And now with ſacred order goes the Prieſt
                     To bring thy daughter to her bloodie ende,
                     The whilſt Mirtillo (wondrous thing to tell)
                     Offer'd by his owne death, to giue her life,
                     Crying, vnbind thoſe handes (vnworthie ſtriges)
                     And in her ſteed that ſhould be ſacrifiz'd
                     Vnto Diana, draue me to the Aulters
                     A Sacrifize to my faire Amarillis.
                     
                  
                  
                     Ti.
                     O admirable deede of faythfull loue.
                     And noble hart.
                  
                  
                     Nu.
                     Now heare a miracle:
                     Shee that before ſo fearefull was to die,
                     Chaung'd on the ſodaine by Mirtilloes wordes,
                     Thus anſweres with a bold vndaunted hart:
                     
                        
Think'ſt thou (my deare) then by thy death to gaine
                     Life to her death, that by thy life doth liue.
                     O miracle vniuſt: on Miniſters, on on, why do you ſtay?
                     Leade me foorthwith vnto mine end: Ile no ſuch pittie I,
                     
                        Mirtill replies, Liue cruell pitteous loue,
                     My hart his ſpightfull pittie doth reproue:
                     To me it longes to die. Nay then to me
                     (She anſweres) that by Law condemned am:
                     And heere anew begins a wondrous ſtrife,
                     As though that life were death, and death were life.
                     (O ſoules well borne) O couple worthy of
                     Eternall honour, neuer dying prayſe:
                     O liuing, and o dying glorious louers.
                     Had I ſo many tongues, ſo many voyces,
                     As Heauen hath eyes, or Ocean ſea hath ſandes;
                     All would be dumbe and hoarſe in ſetting out
                     Their wondrous and incomprehended prayſe.
                     Eternall Childe of heauen, O glorious Dame,
                     That mortall deedes enchronicleſt to time,
                     Write thou this Hiſtorie, and it infold
                     In ſolid Diamond with wordes of gold.
                  
                  
                     Ti.
                     But what end had this mortall quarrell then?
                  
                  
                     Nun.
                     
                        Mirtillo vanquiſheth? O rare debate,
                     Where dead on lyuing getts the victorie.
                     The Prieſt ſpeakes to your Child, be quiet Nimph,
                     We cannot change this doome, for he muſt die
                     That offers death, our Law commaunds it ſo:
                     And after bids, your Daughter ſhould be kept,
                     Leaſt griefes extreame ſhould bring her deſperate death▪
                     
                     Thus ſtood the ſtate When Montane ſent me for thee.

                     In ſooth tis true, ſweete ſcented Flowers ſhall ceaſe
                     To dwell on Riuers bankes, and Woodes in Spring

                     Adorn'd with youth, ſhall ſet ſweete Loue at naught:
                     But if we ſtay ſtill heere, how ſhall we know
                     When it is time vnto the Church to go?

                     Heere beſt of all, for in this place alas,

                     And why not in the Church?
                  
                  
                     Nu.
                     Becauſe there where
                     The fault is done, the puniſhment muſt be.
                  
                  
                     Ti.
                     And why not in the Caue? there was the fault.

But thou ſhalt liue the example of true fayth,
                     But for the Law commaundes thee ſacrifiz'd,

                     Father, let it be lawfull that I call thee ſo,

                     My bodie to the ground I do bequeath, my ſoule
                     To her that is my life: But if ſhe die,
                     As ſhe hath threatned to do; aye mee,
                     What part of me ſhall then remaine aliue,
                     Oh death were ſweete, if but my mortall parts
                     Might die, and that my ſoule did not deſire the ſame:
                     But if his pittie ought deſerues that dyes,
                     For ſoueraigne pittie then courteous father,
                     Prouide ſhe do not die; and with that hope
                     More comforted, Ile pay my deſtenies,

                     What intereſt had the man you ſpeake of in
                     That child? was he his ſonne?
                  
                  
                     Ca.
                     I cannot tell.

                     Had he no better knowledge then of it then thus?
                  
                  
                     Ca.
                     Nor that know I.

                     Know you him if you ſee him?
                  
                  
                     Ca.
                     He ſeem'd a ſhepheard by his cloaths and face,
                     Of middle ſtature, of blacke haire his beard
                     And eye-browes were exceeding thicke.

                     Him whom you talke withall he did not onely ſeeme,

                     Which the outragious Riuer bare away:
                     Did you not tell me you had ſearch'd in vaine
                     All that ſame countrey, with Alpheus waters?
                  
                  
                     Da.
                     Why aske you this?

                     Did not you tell me him

                     I graunt I told you ſo.

                     What child then was it (tell me) which you gaue
                     Vnto this ſtranger which did know you here?

                     Will you I ſhould remember what I did
                     So long agoe? old men forgetfull are.
                  
                  
                     Mon.
                     Is not he old? yet he remembers it.

                     Tuſh he doth rather dote.

                     That ſhall we ſee,

                     I come.

                     Oh that
                     Thou wert as farre beneath the ground.
                  
                  
                     Mon.
                     Tell me
                     Is this the ſhepheard that gaue thee the gift?

                     This ſame is he.
                  
                  
                     
                     Da.
                     What gift is't thou ſpeak'ſt of?
                  
                  
                     Ca.
                     Doſt not remember in the temple of Olimpich Ioue,
                     
                     Hauing had anſwere of the Oracle,
                     And being readie to depart, I met with thee,
                     And ask'd thee of the Oracle, which thou declaredſt,
                     After I tooke thee home vnto my houſe,
                     Where didſt thou not giue me an Infant childe,
                     Which in a cradle thou hadſt lately found?
                  
                  
                     Da.
                     And what of that?
                  
                  
                     Ca.
                     This is that very child,
                     Which euer ſince I like mine owne haue kept,
                     And at theſe Aultars muſt be ſacrific'd.
                  
                  
                     Da.
                     Oh force of Deſtiny.
                  
                  
                     Mon.
                     Yet wilt thou faine?
                     Is it not true which he hath told thee here?
                  
                  
                     Da.
                     Oh were I dead as ſure as it is true.
                  
                  
                     Mon.
                     And wherefore didſt thou giue anothers goods?
                  
                  
                     Da.
                     Oh maiſter ſeeke no more, let this ſuffice.
                  
                  
                     Mon.
                     Yet wilt thou hold me off and ſay no more?
                     Villaine thou dyeſt if I but aske againe.
                  
                  
                     Da.
                     Becauſe the Oracle foretold me that the child
                     Should be in danger on his fathers hands
                     His death to haue if he returned home.
                  
                  
                     Ca.
                     All this is true, for this he told me then.
                  
                  
                     Mon.
                     Ay me, it is too manifeſt, the caſe is cleare.
                  
                  
                     Ca.
                     What reſteth then, would you more proofe then this?
                  
                  
                     Mon.
                     The proofe's too great, too much haue you declar'd,
                     
                        Too much I vnderſtand, 
                        
                           •
                        o Carino, Carino,
                     How I change griefe and fortunes now with thine,
                     How they affections now are waxen mine,
                     This is my ſonne, oh moſt vnhappie ſonne,
                     Of a more wretched father. More ſauadge was
                     The water in him ſauing, then in runing quite away,
                     Since at theſe ſacred Aultars by thy fathers hands
                     Thou muſt be ſlaine, a wofull ſacrifice,
                     And thy poore bloud muſt waſh thy natiue ſoyle.
                  
                  
                     Ca.
                     Art thou Mirtilloes father then? how loſt you him?
                  
                  
                     Mon.
                     The deluge rauiſht him, whom when I loſt,
                     
                        I left more ſafe, now found, I leeſe him moſt.
                  
                  
                     Ca.
                     Eternal prouidence which with thy counſell haſt
                     
                        
Brought all theſe occurrents to this onely point,
                     Th'art great with childe of ſome huge monſtrous birth,
                     Either great good or ill thou wilt bring forth.
                  
                  
                     Mon.
                     This t'was my ſleepe foretold, deceitfull ſleepe.
                     In ill too time, in good too lying ſtill.
                     This was th' vnwonted pitie, and the ſudden horror that
                     I felt to ſtay the axe and ſhake my bones:
                     For nature ſure abhorres a ſtroke ſhould come
                     From fathers hands, ſo vilde abhominable.
                  
                  
                     Car.
                     Will you then execute the wicked ſacrifice?
                  
                  
                     Mon.
                     By other hands he may not at theſe Altars die.
                  
                  
                     Ca.
                     Why will the father murder then the ſonne?
                  
                  
                     Mon.
                     So bids our law, and were it pietie to ſpare
                     Him ſince the true Amyntas would not ſpare himſelfe?
                  
                  
                     Ca.
                     O wicked Fates, me whither haue ye brought?
                  
                  
                     Mon.
                     To ſee two fathers ſoueraigne pitie made a homicide▪
                     
                     Yours to Mirtillo, mine vnto the Gods,
                     His father you denying for to bee,
                     Him thought to ſaue, and him you loſt thereby,
                     Thinking and ſeeking, I to kill your ſonne,
                     Mine owne haue found, and muſt mine owne go kill.
                  
                  
                     Ca.
                     Behold the monſter horrible this Fate brings forth.
                     O cruell chance (Mirtillo) ô my life.
                     Is this that which the Oracle told of thee?
                     Thus in my natiue ſoyle haſt thou me happy made:
                     O ſonne of me poore old and wretched man,
                     Lately my hope, my life, now my diſpaire and death.
                  
                  
                     Mon.
                     To me Carino leaue theſe wofull teares,
                     I plaine my bloud: my bloud, why ſay I ſo,
                     Since I it ſhead? poore ſonne why got I thee?
                     Why wert thou borne? did the milde waters ſaue thy life,
                     The cruell father might the ſame bereaue?
                     Sacred immortal powers, without whoſe deep inſight
                     No waue doth ſtirre in ſeas, no blaſt in skies,
                     No leafe vpon the earth: what great offence
                     Haue I committed, that I worthy am
                     With my poore off-ſpring for to warre with heauen?
                     If I offended haue, oh yet my ſonne
                     
                        
What hath he done you cannot pardon him?
                     O Iupiter the great diſdainfull blaſt
                     Would quickly ſuffocate my aged ſence,
                     But if thy thunder bolts will not, my weapons ſhall.
                     The dolorous example Ile renew,
                     Of good Amyntas our beloued Prieſt,
                     My ſonne amaz'd ſhall ſee his father ſlaine,
                     Ere I a father will go kill my ſonne:
                     Die thou Montane, tis onely ſit for thee,

                     Some great thing moues him thus, theſe many years

                     Father Tirenio, what's the newes with you▪
                     
                     You from the temple? how comes this to paſſe?

                     To you I come for news, yet bring you news
                     How oft blind eyes do aide the inward ſight,
                     The whilſt the minde vntraueld with wilde ſights,
                     Withdrawes into it ſelfe, and Linceus eyes

We may not Montane paſſe ſo lightly ore
                     The vnexpected things, that heauenly mixture temps with humane,

                     Nor partly hold with mortall men at all.
                     But all theſe workes ſo great, ſo wonderfull,
                     Which the blind world to blinder chance aſcribes,
                     Is nothing but ce'eſtiall counſell talke,

                     The good Nicander as thou didſt command,
                     Stayes to conduct the holy ſacrifice,
                     But I retaind him by an accident
                     That's newly falne: the which (I know not) all
                     Vnwonted and confuſ'd, twixt hope and feare.
                     Dulleth my ſence. I cannot vnderſtand, and yet the leſſe
                     I comprehend, the more I do conceiue.

                     That which you know not wretch, I know too well,
                     But tell me can the Fates hide ought from thee?
                     That pierceſt to the deep'ſt of Deſtinies.

                     If (ſonne) the vſe diuine of light propheticall
                     Were natures gift, and not the gift of heauen,

                     That I might better be inform'd who tis
                     That is diſcouered father to the youth

                     I am the wretched father of that wretched ſonne.

                     His that by death giueth an other life,
                     Yet by that death kills him that gaue him life.

                     And for this then doſt thou
                     
                        Montanus call thy ſelfe a wretched father?
                     O monſtrous blindneſſe of theſe earthly mindes,
                     In what a darke profound and myſtie night
                     Of errors be they drowned? when thou O heauenly ſonne
                     Doſt not enlighten them: Montanus thou
                     Art blinder in thy minde then I of eyes,
                     That doſt not ſee thy ſelfe the happieſt father
                     And deareſt to the gods that euer yet did child beget.
                     This was the ſecret which the Fates did hide.
                     This is that happy day, with ſo much bloud
                     So many teares we did expect.

                     And for the auntient fault of that falſe wight,
                     A faithfull ſhepheards pitie make amends.
                     Tell me Montanus, is not this thy ſonne
                     Heauens iſſue? is not Amarillis ſo?
                     Who hath vnited them but onely loue?
                     
                        Siluio by parents force eſpowſed was
                     To Amarillis, whom he hated ſtill,
                     If thou the reſt examine, you ſhall plainly ſee
                     The fatall voyce onely Mirtillo ment.
                     For ſince Amyntas chance where haue we ſeene
                     Such faith in loue that might coequall this?
                     Who ſince Amyntas willing was to die
                     For any Nymph, onely Mirtill except.
                     This is that faithfull Shepheards pitie, which deſerues
                     To cancell that ſame auncient error of Lucrine.
                     
                     
                        
With this deed is the heauens ire appeaz'd,
                     Rather then with the ſheading humane bloud,
                     Rendring vnto th'eternall iuſtice, that
                     Which female treacherie did take away.
                     Hence t'was no ſooner he vnto the temple came,
                     There to renew his vow, but ſtraight did ceaſe
                     All thoſe prodigious ſignes, now did

                     But to my power Ile render you your due.
                     Behold vpon my knees ô heauenly powers,

                        I but begun to to liue, now am I borne againe.
                     Why leeſe I time with words that vnto deeds is due?

                     Why ſtay we Montane now? heauens not expect

In ſtead of death our Goddeſſe now commaunds

                     From top to toe ile tell the wondrous cure.
                     About the wounded Nymph ſtood men and women,
                     Each with a ready hand, but trembling heart.
                     But faire Dorinda would not any ſhould
                     Saue Siluio touch her, ſaying that the hand
                     Which was her hurt, ſhould be her remedie.
                     
                        Siluio, his mother, and I, ſtay'd there alone,
                     Working with counſell too one with his hand,
                     
                        Siluio when gently he had wip'd away
                     The bloudie ſtreames that ſtain'd her Iuory fleſh,
                     Aſſayes to draw the ſhaft out of the wound,
                     But the vilde ſteale yeelding vnto his hand,
                     Left hidden in the wound the harmfull head.
                     Hence came the griefe, for t'was impoſſible
                     With cunning hand, or daintie inſtrument,
                     Or other meanes, to draw it out from thence.
                     Opening the wound perhaps with wider wound
                     He might haue found the ſteele with other ſteele.
                     So mought he do, or ſo he muſt haue done,
                     But too too pitious, and too louing now
                     Was Siluioes hand, for ſuch like cruell pitie
                     By ſuch hard meanes, loue neuer healeth wounds.
                     Although it ſeem'd to her that paine it ſelfe
                     Was pleaſant now betweene her Siluioes hands.
                     He not amaz'd ſayes thus: this head ſhall out,
                     And with leſſe paine then any will beleeue.
                     I put it there, and though I be not able ſtraight
                     To take it out, yet with the vſe of hunting
                     I will reſtore the loſſe I haue by hunting.
                     I do remember now an hearbe that is well knowne
                     Vnto the ſauadge Goate, when he is wounded
                     With ſome Huntſmans ſhaft: this they to vs,
                     Nature to them bewray'd, and t'is hard by.
                     All ſuddenly he parts vnto a neighbour hill,
                     
                        
And there a bundle gathers, ſtraight to vs
                     He comes, and out he drawes the iuyce thereof,
                     And mingles it with veruine ſeed, and roote
                     Of Centaures bloud, making a playſter ſoft,
                     Which on the wound he laies: vertue myraculous,
                     The pain ſtraight ceaſ'd, the bloud was quickly ſtaid,
                     The ſteele ſtraightway without or toile or paine,
                     The workmans hand obeying, iſſues out.
                     And now her ſtrength returnes to her againe,
                     As though ſhe had not ſuffered wound at all:
                     Nor was it mortall, for it had vntoucht
                     Both left the bones and bellies outward runne,
                     And onely pie

                     With ſuch a wondrous Art it graunted was.

                     My ſleep ſhould breake, and thou my ſoule ſhouldſt flye away.
                     In better proofe my ſences would I ſleepe,
                     That this ſweet ſight is not a dreaming ſleepe.
                  
                  
                     Cho. Sh.
                     Come holy Himeneus, come this euen
                     According to our vowes, and to our ſongs
                     Dreſſe thou theſe Louers as them beſt belongs.
                     Both t'one and t'other of the ſeed of heauen,
                     Knit thou the fatall knot this bleſſed eauen.
                  
                  
                     Chorus.
                     O Happie two,
                     That plants haue ſow'd, and reaped ſmyles.
                     In many bitter grieuous foyles
                     Haue you imbelliſt your deſires,
                     Henceforth prepare your amorous fires,
                     And bolden vp your tender ſprights,
                     Vnto your true ſincere delights.
                     You cannot haue a ſounder ioy,
                     There is no ill can you annoy.
                     This is true ioy, true pleaſure, and true mirth,
                     T'which vertue got, in patience giueth birth.
                  
                  FINIS.
