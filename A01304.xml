            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            ¶ To the right honourable and vertuous Ladie, the Ladie Margaret Strange.
            
               YOur honourable and Godly request (madame) to haue this infamous, and Popishe Apologie confuted, maie bee a sufficient testimone, bothe of your loyall affection towardes your prince &amp; countrie, &amp; also of vnfeigned loue towardes God, and his true religion. For as the libell being sclanderous against our soueraigne and her lawes, &amp; blasphemous against God &amp; his truthe, might be a reioysyng to the obstinate &amp; rebellious, and an offence to the weake and ignorant, if the cloudes of calumniation, and deceiptful reasonyng vsed therin, were not driuē a waie with the blaste of some confutation: so the falshod therof beyng opened, and the crafte discouered, by your L. procuremēt, shalbe a matter

of gladnes to the godly, of grief to the wicked, of strenthenyng to the weake, and of learnyng to the ignorant. VVherby trueth beyng mainteined, and errour cōfounded, many men shalbe profited, &amp; God hymself shalbe glorified. And your L. for preferryng so many folde goodnes, may be assured to receiue worthie thankes of men, and plentifull reward of god. But this especially, wherin your L. ought chiefly to reioice, is not to be omitted, that as god hath iustified you in the merites of his sonne through faith cōceiued in your harte, so he hath geuen you an occasion hereby, of his holie name and religion, to make opē profession in the world. VVhē accordyng to the testimonie of the Apostle, as a true and liuely beleif of the hart is necessarie for iustificatiō, so a cleare &amp; open confession of the mouth is requisite

to saluatiō. So that this your L. requeste, might seme in all poinctes most fortunat, if it had not founde so meane an instrument, as I am to accōplishe it. For beside that, I am inferiour to verie many of my brethren, that are meate to take suche a matter in hād, I haue been for these two yeres almost, as it were sequestered, both frō serious studie, and plentie of such bokes, as for such a purpose, were most conuenient. Notwithstāding, esteming your L. motion, as a prouocatiō sente of god, to occupie my idle tyme, &amp; to employe some parte of gods giftes, to the profite of his Churche, as my duetye bindeth me, I thought good to shew my self, rather vnable, thē willing to satisfie your godly desire. Not that the obiectiōs of the aduersarie were of suche weight, but that thei might easely bee auoyded by many thousand

christians, whom God hath indued with meaner giftes of knowledge, &amp; vnderstandyng, then it hath pleased hym to bestowe vpon me: but that I am priuie to myne owne imperfection, whereby I am lesse apt, to beautifie a matter, with such copy, &amp; eloquence as many other are, &amp; I would wish that this argument might haue been handled. Neuertheles, accordyng to my bare, and simple facultie, I haue endeuoured to set forthe the truthe, rather with substaunce of matter, then with florishyng of woordes, not caryng howe finely, but howe plainly, I might cause it to appere, seyng it is no lesse charitable to teach the ignoraunt, then it is commendable to please the learned. And this labour I haue bestowed for the profite of others, and not for the praise of my self. For whiche cause also I thought it

not beste, to encomber the simple reader with many reasōs, or authorities to proue one matter, but to enstructe hym with a few, and those pitthie, &amp; of force to perswade. Sauyng that in one questiō of iustification, in multitude of testimonies, I maie seme to be ouer tedious, if the cause be not considered, whiche prouoked me thereto. For seyng the aduersaries without shame crie out, that our doctrine of iustification, is suche a straunge paradox as neuer was hearde of in the worlde, before our tyme, the same doctrine, beeyng the chiefe foundation of true Religion, I thought it expedient, that the vnlearned were admonished, what plētifull witnesses it hath of antiquitie, as it hath moste manifest aucthoritie in the holie worde of God. To conclude, there were twoo other considerations that encouraged me,

to take vpon me this cōfutation. One because this Popishe apologie discouereth no greate learnyng of the aucthor, there is no greate connyng to bee required, in hym that should make answere to it: &amp; for that it hath presumed, to thrust it self into the princes court, it is not impertinēt that it should be confuted, by one that is attēdant in the same. Thus hauing doen my good will, I moste humbly desire your L. to take it in good parte: besechyng almightie God so to continue and encrease his giftes of vertue, and godlines in your L. that you maie be blessed with true honour, and prosperitie in this life, and afterward, rewarded with eternall ioye, and felicitie.
            
               Your L. to commaunde in the Lorde William Fulke.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            An aunswere to a Popishe apologie ¶An Apollogie of a Papiste confuted by W. F.
            
               THere was found in the court, either cast of purpose, or lost of negligence, a certain small pamphlette, conteinyng an Apollogie, or aunswere of a Papiste, to some frendes of his, that perswaded hym to conforme hymself, to the Religion now receiued in the realme, by publike aucthoritie: whiche when it came to my handes, supposyng it might do some hurte emong them that are ignoraunte, I thought good, briefly to confute it. But because the copie whiche was founde, was vnskilfully written, I had some diffultie to reade it in certaine places, and sometymes I mighte plainely perceiue, that the aucthours meanyng was chaunged by vntrue writyng: So that the aucthour, or his frendes, maie haue some occasion to cauill at my publishing of the copie, whiche was so muche corrupted: In cōsideratiō wherof, I would haue been verie glad, to haue had the principall copie of the aucthours owne hande, if I could haue knowen how

to come by it. But seyng I was out of hope of that, I perused, and restored the copie that I had, as faithfully as I could, desiryng the aucthour, or his frendes, that haue the originall, if I haue erred in any woorde of any momente, to lette me haue knowledge thereof, and I will thereby reforme the apologie, and alter myne answere thereto accordyngly. The writyng had this title.
            
               The Papiste.
               Certaine considerations and causes, mouyng me not to bee presente at, nor to receiue, neither vse the seruice of the newe booke, otherwise called the Common boke of praiers.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               If the copie of your title, as it came to my hande, was not peruerted, you shewe your self in your title, to bee a very peruerse▪ and froward persone, that maie not vouchsafe to call the booke, as it is commonly called. Especially whē you pretend to geue it the name, whiche commonly it beareth, for you are not ignorante, that it is called the booke of Common praier, and not the Common booke of praier. But a

man maie easely, and peraduenture truely gesse, why you refused to cal it the boke of common praier, leaste any man should conceiue by the onely name, that common praier, which is so necessarie for the Churche of Christe (a forme whereof that booke conteineth) is altogether wantyng in your Popishe Churche, where, in your Missalles, Processionalles, Hymnalles, Grailes, Antiphonalls, and Pontificalls, are not conteined common praiers, to the edification of all the churche, but idle, and vnprofitable ceremonies, to the mainteinaunce of ignoraunce, and superstition.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               The first consideration is, because the saide seruis booke, was condemned as hereticall and schismaticall, Anno domini 1553. both by the clergie and cōuocation of this realme, and by the nobilitie and commons of the same, by al whose consentes ther passed an acte of Parliament, for the repeale therof. Beside that Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer, the chief aucthours and composers of the saied boke, were therfore openly condemned by the Churche, and Lawes of this realme, &amp; suffered the paines of death

in Oxforde. S. Paule in his Epistle willed the hebrues, to haue in remembrance their Bishoppes, which preached vnto them the woorde of God, and diligently to obserue and looke vpon the ende of their liues and conuersation.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               The first consideration cōteineth two causes of your refusal, the one because the booke of Seruice, was repealed by Acte of Parliament, the other, for that Cranmer Ridley, and Latimer, were burned at Oxforde for it. To the first I aunswere, that if you accompt the aucthoritie of the Parliament of force to condempne it, why doe you not acknowledge th'aucthoritie of the same, in establishyng it, for anno. 1551. by all the states of the realme, that boke was allowed, and appoincted to bee vsed. Also by diuerse Actes of Parliamente, in the tyme of our soueraigne Ladies reigne, established, and cōfirmed. But it is no hard matter, to gather your traiterous meanyng, whiche is common to you, with all them of your religion. You accoumpte no actes of Parliament, passed in the tyme of kyng Edward, or Quéene Elizabeth, to be

of any aucthoritie, beyng confirmed by the roiall assent of those, whom you esteme to be no lawfull Princes, seyng your father the Pope, hath pronounced sentence of depriuation against them.
               Your seconde reason, I will tourne vpon your owne necke. Seyng Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer, did so constauntly suffer death, for the confirmation of that doctrine, whiche thei hadde taught, it is a good argumente, that thei dissembled not with vs, but vttered that truthe vnto vs, wherein as thei liued, so thei were content to dye. The text of the Apostle to the Hebres. 13. you applie verie straungely, as though wee should thincke well of none, that suffreth death by martyrdom, wheras the Apostle meaneth cleane contrary, and exhorteth the Iewes, to followe the faithe of them, the ende of whose conuersation, thei had séen to be agreable to their doctrine, who, as thei had preached diligē
                  tly, so did thei ende their liues by tormentes, in the same confession constauntely, and patiently.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               The seconde consideration is, that the

saied booke so vniuersally condemned by all degrees of men here in this realme, was receiued and brought in againe only by the nobilitie and cōmons of this realme, cleane contrary to the whole mindes of our Clergie, no one person in the Parliamente did giue his consente thereunto. Besides that the whole conuocation did exhibite their boke to the contrarie. VVherin the shepe taking vpon theim to establishe this boke, contrarie to the learnyng and conscience of their shepherdes, thei haue doen against the expresse wordes of our sauiour Christ, who in describing the office of good shepherde, and the duetie of good shepe saied that a good shepherde muste knowe his sheepe, and his sheepe muste knowe hym, heare his voice and followe hym. And the Apostle S. Paule in his Epistle Cap. 13. willed the Hebrues to obey their shepherdes, and spirituall gouernours, and to submitte themselues vnto theim, for thei doe watch euen as men whiche muste geue accompte for their soules. Obey them therfore saieth S. Paule that they maie do it with ioie, and not with grief.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               
                  Your seconde consideration, is determinable, by suche as are skilfull in the lawes of this realme, what persones muste concurre, in the Parliament, that it may be an Acte of Parliamente, and I doubte not, but the matter was so ordered, by the iudgemente of them that had knowledge, as was for the honour, and wealthe of the realme. But if any errour had been committed, at that tyme you speake of, it was since by all three estates in Parliament redressed, the same booke of seruice, by their aucthoritie being confirmed. But whereas you complaine, that the Shepe in that firste Parliament, tooke vpon thē against their shepherdes, I aunswer naie, but the Shepherdes againste the Shepebiters, for your Cleargie consisted all of Wolues, and not of Shepherdes, wherefore it was the duetie of the Prince, with the nobles, and senatours of that Parliamente, to deliuer the Shepe out of their cruell tyrānie, and to banishe, and remoue all suche raueinous beastes, frō the flocke. And touchyng the booke, you saie thei exhibited, of what credite would you haue it to bee, when thei so shamefully refused

conference, before the moste parte of the Parliamente, vpon a friuolous pretence, in Westminster churche. At whiche time al wise menne sawe, that their cause was naught, whiche durste not abide the triall in the open light.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               The thirde consideration is, that it is prohibited by the Canons of the apostles, and by the generall caunselles also, that a christian man shoulde not communicate neither in Sacramentes nor yet in commō praiers, with Heritikes and Schismatikes. As it appeareth in the tenth Canon, and in the seconde Canon of the counsell holden at Antioche. It was decreed there, that it was not lawful to communicate with excōmunicate persones, nor to enter into any house, nor to praie with thē, nor lawfull to receiue them that are excommunicate out of one churche into another churche. And in the coūsel holdē at Laodicea, it was prohibited there, that the christiā men should enter into the churches or churche yerdes, of the heretikes, there to praie with them, and in the 33. Canon of the same counsell the like prohibition is there expressed for

praier with Schismatikes. And in the 4. counsell holden at Carthage Canon 73. it was decreed, that christian men should nether praie nor singe with Heretikes. And who so euer did praie, singe, or communicate, with any excōmunicate person, whether he were of the Clergie or of the Laitie, shoulde be thereby excommunicated. An example we reade therefore, how the christian men at Constantinople would not cō
                  municate with the Arianes, neither in Sacramentes, nor yet in commō praiers, notwithstādyng that the Arians did agree with the Christen menne in theim bothe, as in all Sacramentes, and in all poinctes of praiyng, sauing that the Arians did sing Gloria patri in filio, and the Christian menne, Gloria patri &amp; filio, &amp;c. And therfore, and for that onely poinct, Ihō Chrysostome then beyng Bishop of Constantinople, did appoincte vnto the christian men a seperate place, and maner of praier from them, as it appeareth in the sixth of the Historie Ecclesiastike. And therefore the notable doctour S. Augustine doth conclude, on thys wise, saiyng, that they shall not communicate in Sacramētes with vs, whose doctrine

we cannot approue and allowe.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               Your third consideration, standeth vppon a foolishe fallation of Sophistrie, called petitio principij, whiche is, whē a man will take that as true, whiche his aduersarie will not graunte hym. As you doe in this your argument, where you take that for a true principle, whiche you shall neuer be able to proue, namely that we are Heretikes, and Schismatikes. And so you committe double folie. Firste, in prouyng that so diligentely, whiche no manne will deny (whiche is, that a manne ought not to communicate in religion with Heretikes) and secondly, in bringing no proofe at all, of that, which all your aduersaries wil deny, namely that thei are Heretikes, or Schismatikes. For you must first prooue that thei are suche, before you can proue, that you ought to auoide their societie.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               The fowerth consideration is, that the receiuyng of this new booke of seruice, is a condemnation of the olde, wherby is taken away 5. of the. 7. Sacramentes, the reall presence of Christes body in the Sacramente

of the alter, the sacrifice of the masse, many traditions of the Apostles, as the holiyng of the Fonte, oile and Chrisma in Baptisme and Confirmation, the making of the signe of the Crosse, praiers for the deade and vnto sainctes. All sacramentall, and godly cerimonies, frequented in the vniuersal churche of Christe, and brougt into this realme with the faithe of Christe by S. Augustine, and here by hym established, as suer signes and tokens of christian faieth, like as the holy. S. Bede witnesseth in his firste boke de gestis Anglorum, in the 25.29.30. chapiters, beside that all the foresaide thinges haue been alwaie approued, vsed, and allowed throughout the vniuersal church of christ. And therfore saieth S. Augustine all these thinges whiche haue been receiued in the vniuersall Churche of Christe, and approued by the vse, and consente therof, ought not to be ouerthrowen, nor yet to be chaū
                  ged by the iudgemente of one priuate person, be his learnyng and liuyng neuer so good, nor yet by the Bishoppes of any one prouince or countrie, when thereby they shoulde breake the vnitie of Gods spirite, whiche is the chief treasure in his Churche,

commended by our sauiour Christe vnto his Apostles, wishynge and praiynge the same vnitie to be amongest theim, whiche was betwixt him and God (Ioan 17) the father. The Apostle S. Paule tought the Corinthians aboue all thinges to obserue this vnitie, and willed the Romaines that with one minde and one mouth they shoulde glorifie God. And in the Epistle to the Ephesians, he besought theim most entirely to obserue this vnitie. Again. S. Augustine saieth, these thinges whiche the vniuersall churche doth teache, therfore are to be obserued and kepte of all menne, because the churche which is the spouse of Christ, hath the full aucthoritie of her husband Christ, and suche gouernement also of the holy ghost, that she cannot consent, but to true thinges, nor she cannot commaunde but onely suche thinges whiche are both holy, holsome and good. And farther the same S. Augustine saieth, that in the ministratiō of the Sacramentes, and in the manner of praiyng vsed of Preestes, there must be an vniformitie obserued in Christes catholike Churche, that by their Lawe and maner of praiyng there may be established the lawe

of beleuyng. And lest that the lawe, and maner of praiyng being chaunged, may also bring foorthe a chaunge and alteration of faieth, like as it hath so proued in thys realme. Beside that S. Ambrose doth thinke that there can not bee the faieth, where Schisme is, for albeit that schismatikes may haue faieth towardes God, yet they cannot haue faieth towarde the Churche of God, whom they suffer to bee dismembred, and discerped in peeces. For wheras our sauiour Christe suffered for his Churche, and the Churche is the mysticall bodie of Christe, how therfore may thei haue faith in christ, by whom his Passion is made frustrate, and his mysticall bodie drawen in peeces. And therefore woulde not we shoulde chaunge an order set, or a custome of Christes churche. For albeit saieth he, the reason or cause of a custome may be sought for, yet must it be so sought for, that the custome thereby be not infirmed or broken, for the searche may not bee made vnto destruction, but vnto aedification, wherby thou maist better obserue the custome when thou arte assured of the cause and reason therof. I do praise thee (saieth Tertuliane) whiche firste

doeth beleue the custome to be obserued, before it hath learned the cause and reason why and wherfore.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               In your fowerth consideration, you should haue likewise considered, that suche thynges, as are graunted of bothe partes, nede small proofe, and that those matters, whiche are in controuersie, should be substancially cōfirmed. As for example. How necessarie vnitie is for the Churche of Christe, no manne doubteth, so it bee in truthe, and not in falshed: for there is vnitie emong the mooste wicked, but not in truthe, and honestie.
               On the other side, that there be fiue sacramentes, more then the boke alloweth, that there is a carnall presence in the Sacrament of the Lordes bodie, and bloude, that there is, or ought to be, a Sacrifice in the masse, ye bring not one worde of proof.
               Concernyng Ceremonies, whiche you call traditions of the Apostles, you saie in deede a little, although to little purpose, and yet so confusely, and out of all good order, that you seme rather to confounde, then to instructe your simple reader, for

what an hochpotte is this? in the middes of your Sacramentes, and Sacramentalles, to choppe in praiers for the deade, and inuocation of sainctes, whiche bée articles of doctrine, and not Ceremoniall obseruations. Againe, when you haue rehersed by name, diuers Ceremonies, as oile, and chrisme in Baptisme, your maner of confirmation, the signe of the Crosse, and all other your Sacramentalls, and Ceremonies, you bryng in certain broken, and vnperfecte sentences of Doctours, whiche speake generally of Ceremonies, vsed in the churche in their age: and doe not shew that your Ceremonies were vsed then in suche maner, as you vse them now: which is a meere mockerie of your readers. For wheras you doe comprehende thē all, vnder the name of Traditions of the Apostles, if you be a man of suche learning, as you would seme to be, I dare saie in your behalfe, you will bee ashamed to come to triall of this poincte, that you vse all those Ceremonies, that were vsed in the tyme of those doctors, whose names you alledge or that al your Ceremonies, were vsed in the tymes of those Doctours, vpon whose

aucthorities you would seme to grounde. But to cōsider your groundes particularly, that Augustine, whom you call saincte Augustine, was an vnlearned Monke, as appereth by his questions, propounded to Pope Gregorie, that came into this land, to corrupte the sinceritie of faithe, whiche the Britons had receiued, euen from the Apostles, aboute sixe hundred yeres after Christe, and liued twoo hundred yeres at the least, after the aunciente father sainct Augustine bushoppe of Hippo in Affrica, of whose pride and folie, you maie reade in Galfridus Monumeth. Matheus Westmin. and others. And truthe it is, that muche superstition, and false doctrine, he brought in, and by tyrannie mainteined, as our stories witnesse, but not all that you holde at this tyme, for your religion, in all pointes, is nothyng so old. And as for Beda, he liued longe after Augustine. But where you affirme, that all youre Ceremonies haue been alwaies approued, vsed, and allowed, throughout the vniuersall churche of Christe, I can no longer forbeare you, you saie more then all the Papistes in the worlde, will be able to proue.
               
                  Touchyng sainct Augustine, although the place by you alledged, is not to be foūd in his vndoubted writyngs, yet I confesse that he speaketh fauourably of Ceremonies cōmonly vsed, to be quietly suffered, and borne withall, rather then vnitie to bee broken. But what maketh this, for your Ceremonies, whiche you teache to bee necessarie for saluation, and meritorious: whiche if thei had been in saincte Augustines tyme, or that men had so taught of theim, there is no doubte, but he would haue vtterly misliked theim, as hereafter in place more conueniente, I shall plainly declare. In your next sentēce out of sainct Augustine also, I must néedes tel you, you plaie the suttle Marchaunt, to sett for the counterfeict ware, in steede of true marchandice, for Augustine neuer was of that opinion, that the Church hath the full aucthoritie of her husbande Christ, and such gouernemente of the holy Ghost, that she cannot consente, but vnto true thynges, neither hath he any suche wordes in al his workes. For it is well knowen, that the boke de dogmaticis ecclesiasticis, out of which this sentence séemeth to bee borrowed, is

not accompted among the Authenticall workes of Augustine, but forged of muche later time, and falsly fathered vpon S. Augustine, to steale credite from his name, whiche it could not obtain of it self.
               And yet if this saiyng were graunted to bée true, it perteineth nothyng to your church, which is the Sinagoge of Sathan, and not the Churche of Christe. Concernyng your thirde testimonie of sainct Augustine, I can hardely thinke that saincte Augustine, would haue an vniformitie of Ceremonies, in praier, and administratiō of the Sacramentes throughout all the worlde, because I am able to shewe his aucthoritie to the contrary, as in his. 118. epistle to Ianuarius, he discourseth at large. And whereas you saie, that the chaunge of the maner of praiyng, hath broughte in chaunge of faithe in this lande, it is cleane contrary, for the diuersitie of faithe, teacheth vs to praie, otherwise then you vse, for inuocation commeth of faithe, as witnesseth sainct Paule. Roma. 10.
               
               The testimonie of saincte Ambrose, although you declare not, where a manne should finde it, maketh little for your purpose.

For we agrée with hym, that Schismatikes are to be abhorred, but wée will not graunt to you, that wée are Schismatikes, as long as wée knowe, that wée are members of Christe. The testimonie of Tertuliane concernyng custome, if it bee faithfully rehearsed of you, I se not what it maketh for you. For although laudable customes, maie be obserued, without searchyng their beginnyng, what is that, to your Ceremonies, whiche containe manifeste impietie? For you your self will not bee so madde, to allowe all customes, seyng many are contrary to the worde of GOD. And although Tertuliane was to muche addicted to the maintainyng of Ceremonies, and customes in some places, yet otherwhiles he either expoundeth his meanyng, or correcteth his errour, as in his booke De virginibus velandis, where he writeth in these woordes. Hoc exigere veritatem, cui nemo praescribere potest, non spacium temporum, non patrocinia personarum, non priuilegium regionum. Ex his enim fere consuetudo initium ab aliqua ignorantia vel simplicitate sortita, in vsum per successionem corroboratur, &amp; ita aduersus veritatē vindicatur. Sed dominus

noster Christus, veritatē se, nō consuetudinē cognominauit. Si semper christus &amp; prior omnibus: aeque veritas sempiterna &amp; antiqua res, viderint ergo quibus nouū est, quod sibi vetus est.
               
               
                  Haereses non tam nouitas quam veritas reuincit. Quodcū
                     
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      aduersus veritatem sapit hoc erit haeresis, etiam vetus consuetudo. That is to saie. This the truthe requireth, againste whiche no man can prescribe, not the continuance of tyme, not the defence of persones, not the priuiledge of any regions. For of these, custome takyng her beginnyng, for the moste parte, through ignoraunce, and simplicitie, is confirmed into an vsage, by succession, and so is bosted of against the truthe. But Christ our Lorde called hymself the truthe, and not the custome, if Christ were alwaies, and before all, truthe is, as eternall, and aunciente a thyng as he. Lette them bee well aduised therefore, to whom that is compted new, whiche of hym is coumpted old. Heresies (saieth he) not so muche their noueltie, as truthe doeth conuict, for what soeuer soū
                  deth against the truthe, that shalbe an heresie, yea though it be an old custome. By this testimonie of Tertuliane, euery man

maie see, what he thought of old custome, when it was alledged to deface the truthe, and of what customes he speaketh, when he commendeth customes, namely suche as agree with the truthe, and not euery blinde, &amp; superstitious Ceremonie, wherof a greate nomber were inuented, many hundreth yeres after his death.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               The fifte consideration is, that wheras I am not perswaded that the forme of praiers set forth in the saide boke, is lawful and catholike, my comyng to heare it shoulde bee an acte, not onely contrarie to mine owne conscience and also to my damnable sinne, but also my comyng therto, should be to the weake and ignorant, an occasion of ruine, and deadly sinne, which is called scandalum infirmorum, and I am bound by the words of our sauiour Christ, to auoide that, saiyng wo be to that man, by whom any suche offence or slaunder shall vprise and come. For of my comyng thether, either they muste iudge that I am a dissembler in doyng against my cōscience, or els they must iudge that I am in cōscience perswaded thereunto. And therby gather by

mine example a likyng of that thing to be good and holy, which in my very conscience I do vtterly condemne, and that this slaunder shall not be so taken, as scandalum acceptum, but so geuen as scandalum datum of my parte. And wher as it hath been often tymes obiected vnto me, how that it is but a very small matter to sticke or staie at, for to come to the Church, and heare the saied seruice, beyng set at libertie, secretly, and priuily to praie with my self whatsoeuer I shall thinke mete, for he aunswere, I doe reade in the Scriptures howe Eleazarus the Preest is in the same commended, because he would not dissemble the eatyng of swynes fleshe, wheras he might haue escaped the paynes of death therby. Tertulliane writeth a booke in the praise of a Souldiar, and entituleth his boke de corona militis, because that Souldiar refused in natali die Seueri imperatoris, to weare but a Garlande of flowers vpōn his heade, because he should therin then haue followed the maner of the gentiles, and heathen people. And rather or he would do so small a mattet, as to weare but a Garland of flowers, he did suffer inprisonment, and therfore

is commended of so greate a clerke, as Tertullian was. Theodoritus in hys second booke of the historie Ecclesiastike, in Cap. 24. doth note Leontius Bishoppe of Antioche of greate dissimulation, for as much as he, beyng present in the quire at Antioche, and in the hearing of christian men, there to sing Gloria patri &amp; filio, &amp;c. and the Arians Gloria patri in filio, &amp;c. Contrariwise he did there openly take nether partie, but priuily at the ende of euery psalme did sing Gloria pari in saecula saeculorum. Amen. And so he mumbled it vp to hym selfe, vt ab instantibus vix audiri posset, whose example therfore beyng so manifest, and so well admonished therof, I purpose not to followe God willyng. VVhen to dissemble with a mā I hold it no honestly, to dissemble with my Prince, it is the iuste deserte of perpetuall discredite, and infamie, but to dissemble with God, it is most impietie, from the whiche detestable sinne, I am vtterly resolued by the word god, spoken by the mouth of Helias saiyng: Vsquequo claudicatis in duas partes? How long will you halte or limpe on both sides? And S. Ihon in his reuelation saieth: Because thou arte neither whot

nor colde, therfore I shall beginne now to vomit and cast thee out of my mouth. The premisses well waighed, it cannot be iustly saied that I sticke at a trifling or small matter, but a matter of greate importance, and conscience moueth me therunto, and forceth me that I shoulde not vnaduisedly without greate cause seperate my self, from the vnity of the Churche, neither to condēne the vniuersal church, vnheard hauing no iust or weightie cause why I should so doe. For I haue alwaies, and doe thus waigh the matter with my selfe, that the poinctes and matters of religion, which this boke of seruice, hath condemned or taken awaie, ether thei were thought matters of smal importāce and did no harme, but being rightly vnderstanded might haue doen good, or els thei were to be taken, for matters of impietie and intollerable to be borne withal. In case thei were of the firste sorte, whiche thei haue condemned and abolished. Then in my iudgement they should haue been tolerated and borne withall, for charities sake, and for the continuance, and encrease of vnitie betwixte vs and the vniuersall Church of christendom. On the other side,

in case thei had been taken for matters intollerable, and could in no wise haue been borne with all for their impietie, as it hath been pretended, then yet in my cōscience, we ought to haue been better aduised then by our priuate condemnation of theim, to haue shewed our selfe to condemne thereby, al the whole vniuersall church of impietie vnheard, which thinges the vniuersall church hath vsed from the Apostles time, and doe to this daie. As touching matters of right faieth, and godly maners, the churche of Christe beyng the spouse of Christ, was neuer destitute of the holy ghost, neither could nor woulde in all this tyme haue borne or dissembled any impietie like as. S. Augustine writeth hereof. The Church of God beyng placed and put among muche chaffe, and many Cockles, and wedes, the same church doth suffer, and beare with many thinges, yet that notwithstandyng, touchyng the thinges whiche are against faithe, and against good life, the Churche doth neither approue theim, nor yet lette theim escape vnspoken against.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               In that you will not dissemble against

your conscience, if you doe not dissemble, but speake as you thinke, you are to bee commended: but if your conscience, as you saie, is not yet perswaded, you are by no meanes to bée excused, for in this so cleare light of the Gospell, you could not bee so blind, if you did not obstinately close your iyes, from receiuyng the Sunne beames into theim.
               And whereas you thinke it not reason, to departe from the vnitie of the churche, nor to condemne the vniuersall Churche vnheard, you stande vpon a false grounde, as you dooe alwaies, that the Popishe Churche, is that vniuersall Churche, but that you shall neuer be able to proue. For was the Popishe churche at any tyme, or is it nowe vniuersalle? But the Romishe churche, you will saie, is alwaies vniuersall, though it haue neuer so many enemies. But I can shewe you by saincte Augustines iudgemente, that the vniuersall Churche, maie bee without the Romishe churche. For writyng to Casulane. Epi. 86. he hath these woordes, speakyng of one that defended the Ceremonies, &amp; custome of the Romishe churche, against the whole

catholike Churche. Quod vtinam sic quaereret, aut sic affirmaret, vt toto terrarum orbe diffusam, exceptis Romanis &amp; adhuc paucis occidentalibus, apertissimè nō blasphemaret ecclesiam. that is to saie: whiche thyng I would he did seeke in suche maner, or so affirme, that he did not moste manifestly thereby, blaspheme the churche, dispersed through out the whole worlde, excepte the Romanes, and a fewe other Westerne Churches. Doe you not here see, that when the Romishe churche, with a fewe other that agréed with her are exempted, the vniuersall churche of Christe still remaineth, by sainct Augustines iudgemente? and that if the Romishe Churche, departe from the whole Catholike Churche, the Romishe Churche is a Schismatike, as it is at this daie, and hath been a long time, euen since Antichriste sette vp his seate there, and made a generall departyng from the faith of Christ, which sainct Paule prophesieth should come to passe. ij. Thessal. ij. All the whiche tyme, though there were but few that continued in true faithe, and honouryng of God, yet those fewe, wheresoeuer thei were scattered in all the worlde, wer

the true catholike Churche of Christ, and were alwaies ioigned together in Christe their heade, by vnitie of true religion.
               And whereas you saie, your Churche is vnhearde, I maruaile what you meane, for what can the Pope, or any of her proctours, saie in her defence, but it hath been hearde, and confuted by the scriptures? Whiche thing hath caused, the most part of the regions of Europe this daie, to forsake your Hereticall, Schismaticall, and Antichristian Churche of Rome, and to ioigne them selues to the true Catholike, and Apostolike churche of Christ, whiche approueth all her doctrine, out of the holie Scriptures, and by the same reproueth all your heresies, and erronious opinions: the iudgement, and triall of whiche holy Canonicall scriptures, you neuer yet durst abide. It is not therefore any priuate condemnation, whiche is pronounced out of Gods woorde, against heresies, whose aucthoritie in all thynges is highest, and of al menne to bee obeied. Finally, where you affirme, that the churche of Christe, was not destitute of the holy Ghoste, I agree with you, but that your Churche, is the

Churche of Christe, I maie in no wise acknowledge. And truthe it is, that the true Churche did alwaies reclaime, against the heresies of your church, as thei sprong vp and increased in the worlde, and receiued that reward, whiche true Prophetes haue accustomed to receiue of wicked tyrantes namely, persecution, imprisonmente, and cruell death, as appeared in Bertramus, Marsilius of Padua, Pauperes de Lugduno, Iohannes de Gandauo, Bruno Andegauensis, Iohannes Wickleue, Iohannes Hus, Hieronimus de Praga. &amp;c. all whiche with many other, in seuerall times, &amp; places, reproued, and confuted your false Churche, and the errours thereof, some in Italie, some in Fraunce, some in Flaunders, some in Germanie, some in Bohemia, and some in Englande, and for the moste part, were either murthered, or otherwise cruelly persecuted for their labours. But yet the heresies of your church, did not escape vnspoken against, and confuted by them.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               The sixte, and laste consideration, that I come not to their churche, is, because I am not of their Churche. S. Augustine in putting

difference of churches saieth, how vnto them whiche haue not all one Sacramē
                  tes, there can not be one religion, nor consequently one Churche. And the cause why I am not of their Churche, but refuse to communicate with theym in religion, besides this saiyng of S. Augustine, that we should not Communicate in sacramentes with those men whose doctrine we can not aproue and allow: I do refuse to be of their church, because I cannot learne nor vnderstande, of what church they are of. For thei beyng first Baptized in the catholike churche, and in the very self faieth and religion, wherin I do at this present time, beleue and remaine: thei are departed therefro, some to the Lutheranes Church, some to the Zwinglians, and comyng last of al to the church Geneua, they are in maner fled from that church also, and by attributing the chief &amp; supreme gouernment of this their English churche vnto the Quenes highnes, thei are in doctrine directly against their old maister Caluine, being the chief Apostle of the Church of Geneua, whiche Caluine in the eight Chapter of the boke of his institutions, doth directlie reason against Kynges,

and Princes, for takyng vpon theim spirituall gouernment in the Church of Christ, and in the same Chapiter he doeth muche commende the holy Bishop S. Ambrose, and the noble Emperour Theodosius, Ambrose for his greate stoutnes and resistance made against the Emperour: And Theodosius for his greate submission, and obediens shewed vnto the Bishop. The history whereof is at large expressed in Ecclesiastica historia. And the saide Caluine in hys exposition vppon the fowerth Chapiter of the prophete Amos, doth taxe King Henry the eight by name, because he alone, of all other Princes was the first that toke vpon hym in the Church of Christ spirituall gouernmēt, whose example in that poinct, there was neuer one Prince in all Germanie, nor yet in any place els where, of the whole world, that woulde followe the same, but his owne naturall sonne Kyng Edward the sixte, beyng then in his minoritie, and againe the Queenes highnes that nowe is, If therfore I shall departe from the comon knowen catholike Church wherin I stand, I would gladly knowe of theim vnto what Church I shoulde repaire, to be instructed

with out errours, wherin vnitie, charitie, and veritie doe dwel, what forme of a churche are thei able to shew, wherupon a christian man may be bolde to assure himselfe? And if peraduenture they cease not ro pretende, that the Primitiue Churche is that plat forme of the Churche wherunto they would reduce vs: I answere, that there be so many poinctes wherein they doe dissent from the Primitiue Churche (like as I shall make sufficient proofe thereof) that it can not be so, it is onely pretended, but it shall neuer be proued: The Anabaptistes, the Libertines and the Arians doe pretende gods worde, and the Primitiue Churche as well as thei: And because they are so bolde to name the primitiue church, I aske of theim but this one questiō, whether that this daie 50. or, 60. yeres laste paste, was their Church here in this realme, or in any other parte of christendome? VVhat particuler Church either here in Englande, in the laste yere of Kyng Henry the eight his raigne, or any other realme els, can thei name that taught or receiued vniuersally throughout, in all poinctes the doctrine, that this presente Churche of Englande doeth now teache, or

from that daie, a thousande yeres before that, or from thence, vnto the tyme of Christe, and his Apostles. If thei can not shewe any one suche Churche (as I am well assured, thei shall neuer be able to doe) then it muste nedes followe, that either Christe had no Church in the worlde al that tyme till now their commyng, or elles it muste needes follow that their Churche, is a new inuented and vpstert Church, whiche with christes Primitiue church hath no agreans, like as it shall moste plainly appeare vnto you by these profes followyng.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               In your laste consideration, you doe inconsiderately alledge, that you are not of our Churche, but shewe no sufficient reason, why you ought not to bee one of our Churche. You saie, we are departed from the churche, in whiche we were baptised, as though, if a manne were Baptised in a Churche of heretikes, he is bounde to remaine in the same Churche, and heretical faithe of that Churche, in whiche he was baptised, so that if a manne were baptised in the Churche of Arrianes, Nouatianes, Donatistes, Pelagians, he might not forsake

the faithe, and Churche, in whiche he was baptised, to become a true Christian catholike. A childe of seuen yere old, maie see how slender a reason it is for a manne, to continue in any Churche, or Religion, because he receiued baptisme therin. For if a Papist maie not become a Protestāt, because he was Baptised in the Popishe churche, by the same reason, a Protestant must not become a Papist, if he were baptised in the Protestantes Churche, which you your self by no meanes will graunte.
               The seconde reason you bryng, is of the diuersitye of churches, the Lutherane, the Zwingliane, &amp; the Geneuian. As though the diuersitie of some opinions, not of the greatest importāce, maketh diuers churches. The churche of Salisburie, the churche of Yorke, and the churche of Bangor, had some diuersitie in their maner of seruing God, and yet you will saie, thei were all one Popishe Churche. But to the purpose, you recite more names, then there be diuersities of opinions. For Zwinglius, and Caluine, in the matter of the Sacrament, whiche you shoote at, are all one, and Luther differeth from them. And yet

the difference is not so great, but that thei bee all of one Catholike Churche, because thei agree in the onely foundation, Iesus Christe, and in all opinions, that are necessary to Saluation, although Luther in his opinion of the Sacramente (as a man) was deceiued. And that diuersities of opinions (so longe as the principall groundes of faithe bee obserued vncorrupted) doeth not make diuersitie of churches, you maie easily see, by this example S. Cypriā and all the Churches of Affrica, were in this error, that such as were baptised by heretikes, should be baptised again, which was a very perilous errour. Cornelius, &amp; Stephanus the Bishops of Rome, with the Churches of Europe were, in the contrary opinion. And yet no man euer refused S. Cypriane, to bee a member of the Catholike churche, nor iudged the churches of Affrica, that followed his errour, to bee of any other thē of ye vniuersall church of Christ, emong whom were many martyres, and godly men which liued &amp; died in the same error. Now cōpare Cypriane, &amp; Luther, the one erring in the Sacrament of Baptisme, the other in the Sacramente of the

Supper, if the errour of th'one, did not separate hym from the communiō of the catholike church, no more cā the error of the other. Whiche thing, if it were well weighed, would remoue that stōblyng blocke, that troubleth many weake persones, but can hinder no learned man, cōcernyng the controuersie of Luther, and Zwinglius.
               The third reason is, that we are departed, from the Churche of Geneua, because we ascribe supreme gouernement, in Ecclesiasticall matters, to the Quéenes highnes. Firste, we must bee bolde to tell you, that as we reuerence, and honour all particulare Churches, where true religion is established, so we doe not grounde our self vpon either the opinion, or custome, of any one, but onely vpon the worde of God, and so farre foorthe to followe euery one, as thei come neare to the same rule. But whereas you would sette that excellente, godly Churche of Geneua, at variaunce with vs, aboute the supremacie, your childishe quarrellyng, shall easily appeare to all menne. You alledge Caluine againste vs, in twoo places, one in his Institutions, an other in his Comentarie of the Prophet

Amos. A man in deede, from whom we would bee lothe to dissente, excepte it were for a greate cause. A manne of suche godlie learnyng, and profounde knoweledge in diuinitie, as all the Papistes, that euer were, are not worthie to carrie his bookes after hym. But before I aunswer you, I muste admonishe you, that either your copies, whiche came to my handes, were verie muche corrupted, or els you haue recited those places by hearesaie, rather then by your owne obseruatiō. Your copies sendeth me to the, viij. Chapiter of his Institutions, namyng no booke, and to the fowerth. Chapiter of Amos, whereas that you speake of the one place, is in the fowerth boke, and twelue Chapiter of his Institutions: the other in the seuen Chapiter of Amos. So that in deede, it was more labour to seeke your places, then to make aunswere to them. Concerning the firste, I meruaile you were not ashamed, to alledge Caluine againste vs, where he saieth, that Kynges, and Princes, are subiecte to the discipline of the Churche, as Theodosius was content to be excommunicated by saincte Ambrose, for the murther

he had committed in Thessalonica, (which none of vs denieth) and doe not remember, how substauncially he proueth, that godlie Princes haue aucthoritie, and ought to maintain true religion, by lawes decrees, and iudgementes, whiche is all the supreme gouernemente, that wee ascribe to the Quéenes highnes.
               And as for the place of Caluine vpon Amos, the truthe is this: Caluine findeth fault, not with kyng Hēry, but with those that did ascribe that title vnto hym, and sheweth for what reason, he misliked the same. Not that he denied his lawfull aucthoritie, whiche was meant by that title, of all his godly, and true subiectes: but because, Steuen Gardener bishop of Winchester, by false vnderstandyng thereof, declared that he vnderstode nothing therby, but the tyrannie, whiche the Pope vsurpeth ouer the churche, to be translated vnto the kyng. And therfore at a solemne cōference, at Ratisbone in Germanie, after the Popes aucthoritie by acte of Parliament, was abolished out of the realme, he defended all Popishe religion, whiche remained vnreformed, to bee good, and

godlie, because it was established by the kings aucthoritie, who was supreme head of the churche. He disputed not by reasons, neither cared he for the testimonies of scriptures, but saied, it was in the kynges power, to abrogate all Lawes, and establishe what he thought good in the churche, as to forbidde Priestes marriage, to forbidde laie menne the vse of the Cuppe in the Churche, and all other suche matters, he saied, were in the kynges aucthoritie. This he saied of the Kynges power abroade, and howe he abused that noble Prince at home, to make the Acte of sixe Articles, and other thynges of like effect, there be many yet aliue, that can remember. But seeyng this title of supremacie, dooeth so muche offende you, I praie you lette me demaunde one question of you. Who did first inuent it here in England? Or who did first ascribe it to kyng Henry? Was it not the whole Popishe Cleargie of Englande? when thei were caste in the Premunire, for mainteinyng the power Legantine of Cardinall Wolsey, and submittyng theim selues vnto the Kynge, they flattered hym with that title, and

offered hym a greate somme of money, for their pardon: as witnesseth Halle, and Grafton in their histories, and ther be yet aliue many, that can remēber it. So that if there were any faulte in it, you should blame them, and not vs for it. For so farforthe, as beyng rightly vnderstoode, it declareth the lawfull power of the Prince, wee did, and doe yelde vnto it, but not in Steuen Gardiners sence, whiche Caluin in the place by you alledged, doeth cōfute.
               After this, you require vs to shewe you a Churche, where vnto you maie resorte, whiche hath continued euen since Christ, whiche if it can not bee shewed, you conclude in th'ende, that Christ had no churche, or els our Churche is not Christes Churche. Againe where our Church was fiftie, or sixtie yeres agon. If a manne had asked of Elias, where the churche of God was in his tyme, he could not haue made aunswere, and yet God had his Churche in Elias tyme. The Churche is not alwayes apparaunte, to the iyes of the blynde worlde, in whiche she is a straunger, but is compelled sometymes to flie into the wildernesse, out of the sight of men, by the

persecutiō of the deuill, and his members, as it is Prophesied in the xij. Chapiter of sainct Ihons Reuelation. And yet for fiftie or sixtie yere agone, it had been no harde matter, to haue shewed you diuers members of our Churche, bothe in Englande, &amp; in Bohemia, as th' historie of the church declareth at large. Also in Fraunce at Merindoll, and about Lyōs, but these you will saie, agreed not with vs in all poinctes, but I will aunswere you, thei agréed in the cheifest poinctes, necessary to eternall saluation. For whatsoeuer we are able to shewe, for our Churche, I am sure you are neuer able, to shewe your self, for your churche, that whiche you require vs to shewe: namely a churche that hath continued from this tyme vpwarde, vnto the Apostles, that taught vniformely, and in all poinctes, the doctrine that the Popishe Churche nowe teacheth. Whiche thyng when you haue performed, I will doe the like for oure Churche. In the meane time, that whiche is a sufficiente rule, to finde out the true Churche, by the iudgement of Saincte Augustine, I will declare vnto you. In his booke the vnitate ecclesiae.

Capi. 2. Inter nos autem &amp; Donatistat, quaestio est, vbi sit ecclesia. Quid ergo facturi sumus? In verbis nostris eam quaesituri sumus, an in verbis capitis sui domini nostri Iesu Christi? Puto quod in illius potius verbis eam quaerere debemus, qui veritas est &amp; optimè nouit corpus suum. Betwene vs, and the Donatistes (saieth saincte Augustine) the question is, where the churche should bée. What shall we doe then? shall we seke her in our wordes, or in the woordes of her heade, our Lorde Iesus Christ? I thinke that rather in his wordes, we ought to seke her, which is the truthe, and beste knoweth his own bodie. And in the. xvj. chapiter of the same booke, he writeth thus of the Donatistes Vtrum ipsi ecclesiam teneant, non nisi diuinarū scripturarum canonicis libris ostendant. That is, whether thei haue the churche on their side, let theim shewe none otherwise, but by the Canonicall bookes of holy scriptures. Many other suche testimonies are in S. Augustine, by whiche it is plaine, that he geueth this infallible rule, to knowe the true churche, to examine the doctrine therof, onely by the scriptures. But wheras you saie, that Anabaptistes, Libertines

and Arians, pretende the word of god, and the primitiue Churche, what meane you therby? that we should forsake the worde of god &amp; the Primitiue churche, by whiche all heretikes haue béen cōfuted, what soeuer thei pretended. For though heretikes pretende the scriptures, yet onely by the scriptures thei are to be cōfuted, &amp; though thei appeale to the iudgemente of the primitiue church, yet by the primitiue church thei are condemned for heretikes. I maie as well say, that Arianes, Libertines, and Anabaptistes, boste them selues to be the true Catholike Churche, therefore wee must not allowe the true catholike churche. It is pitie to see menne, that would be coumpted wise, and learned, to reason so fondly, and vnlearnedly. For of all other reasons, it is the vainest, and feeblest shift that the Papistes vse, to flie frō the scriptures, to the aucthoritie of the Churche, in confutation of heresies. For there was neuer yet heresie did arise, but there was as greate controuersie, of the Churche, as of the opinion: for euery heretike, boasteth as well of the Churche, as of the scriptures, but when all is dooen, his bragges of

bothe, muste bee beaten doune, onely by the scriptures. But because you make so proude vauntes, that you will so plainlie proue, that our Churche hath none agreans with the primitiue churche of Christ, in discourse of that controuersie with you, I will sette for the bothe what is the Primitiue churche, and how we agree therewith, and I doubte not, but that I shalbee able by the grace of God, bothe to iustifie our cause, againste your false accusations, and also to ouerthrowe youre falshodde, whiche you haue heaped vppe, to ouerwhelme the truthe.
               And as I haue confuted your sixe considerations, which vnto you seme of greate importaunce, so by Gods helpe I shall auoide all other youre calumniations, in whiche with some subtiltie, but more impudencie, and moste of all impietie, you goe aboute to intangle the consciences, of suche as bee ignorante, and vnlearned, to withdrawe their obedience▪ from the godly lawes of this realme, whiche are established, for the mainteinyng of Gods true Religion, and the abolishyng of all Idolatrie, and superstition.
            
            
               
               The Papiste.
               Argumentes gathered out of the Scriptures, prouyng that this late reformed Englishe churche hath none agreans with the Primitiue churche of Christ.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               The very title of your argumentes declareth, of what force youre argumentes are. Your reasons are tenne in noumber, whiche if thei were all graūted to be true yet foloweth not this conclusion, that our Churche hath no agreance, with the Primitiue Churche of Christe, excepte you would affirme, that all the doctrine of the Primitiue Churche, were comprehended in these tenne poinctes. Again your owne Popishe Churche differeth, in these tenne poinctes, as muche from the Primitiue Churche, as ours, therefore by your owne Logike, I will conclude, that your Popish churche, hath no agreance with the church of Christ. 1. For neither you haue all thinges common, 2. neither dooe you sell your houses, and landes, to putte the price in common. 3. Neither doe you make diuision to euery manne, accordyng to his necessitie. 4. Neither are all mēbers of your

Churche so prouided for, that none dooe begge. 5. Neither doe you baptise onely in the name of Christe. 6. Neither dooe you giue the holy ghost, by laiyng on your handes. 7. Neither dooe you restore theim to health, whom you annoincte with oile, beyng sicke. 8. Neither dooe you make open confession of your synnes. 9. Neither dooe you celebrate the Sacramente, after supper. 10. Neither dooe you abstaine from bloodde, and strangled, therefore by your owne reason, you haue no agreance with the Primitiue Churche of Christe. Or if you maie haue any agreance, these differences notwithstanding, why maie not we the same differences, nothyng lettyng vs, haue sufficient agremente therewith? You see that either your argument is nothyng worthe, or els you haue as little agreance with the Primatiue churche, as we. Your only refuge is this, that it is not necessary for you, to haue any agreance with the primitiue Churche. And that is the opinion of all Papistes, whiche is diligently to be noted, that you disclaime of al title of the Primitiue Churche, whiche you holde, was but an infante, and by addition

of your doctrine, and Ceremonies, is growne to bee of womannes state. As though Christ maried his Churche, when she was vnder age, and so the matrimonie was not ratified, and consumated, before the Pope had nourtured her in his schole, vntill she came to yeres of discretion. For it is as lawfull for me, so to inferre vppon your allegorie, as for you so to allegorise of her.
               But that you maie the better vnderstande, what we meane by the primitiue Churche, I putte you out of doubte, that none of vs doeth attribute vnto her, suche long limites, as you doe in your argumentes, gathered out of the Doctours: where you alledge the seconde counsaill of Nice, as a determination of the primitiue churche, whiche was holden almoste eight hū
                  dred yeres after Christe. Of whiche thing you were not ignoraunt, but you thought it was sufficiente, to fill vnlearned eares, with greate blastes, voide of all reason, or truthe. Wherefore, when wee appeale to the Primitiue Churche, wee meane the Churche of the Apostles, and their successours, so longe as thei continue in the doctrine

of the Apostles, whereof triall is to be made, by the Canonicall writynges of the Apostles. That wheras you accuse vs for departyng frō your churche, as though we were of no Churche, wee defende our selues to be of the true churche, seyng wée retaine the faithe, and doctrine of the primitiue Churche, whiche without all controuersie, was the true churche. Now as I haue shewed you, what we accompte to bee the primitiue churche, so muste I declare, in what thynges wee are bounde to consente, and agree with the same. For whiche purpose, we must marke this difference, whiche I suppose, no Papist is so farre paste shame, to deny: namely, that in the primitiue Churche, some thynges were necessarie, and immutable, some thynges againe were temporall, and variable. Of the firste sorte is the doctrine, and Sacramentes, of the latter sorte are Ceremonies, and politike constitutions. To the doctrine no manne maie adde, no man maie diminishe, no manne maie alter, any thyng thereof. The Sacramentes beyng, as Augustine calleth theim, the visible woorde, bee of the same nature with

the doctrine. On the other side, Ceremonies, and publike constitutions, mate bee reteined, or chaunged, as thei make beste for edificatiō, for order, and for comelines. And of this latter sorte, are all those thinges, whiche you alledge, in which we differ from the primitiue churche. But yet, so longe as we holde still the same faithe, and the same Sacramentes, whiche are lefte to vs by the primitiue Churche, all reasonable men will iudge, that notwithstandyng your reasons, wee haue suche agreance with the primitiue Churche, as may proue vs to be members of the same. For it is the vnitie of faithe, and Sacramētes, not of Ceremonies, and constitutions, that ioigneth vs vnto the bodie of Christe, as witnesseth sainct Paule to the Ephesi. iiij. One faithe, one baptisme, one God. &amp;c. Now let vs particularly consider your tenne differences.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               First it is written howe the beleuers in the Primitiue churche had all thinges in common. And no one man did reckon the thing that he did possesse, to be his owne or priuate.
            
            
               
               The aunswere.
               Firste, it it is a sporte to see, howe to make a shewe of a greate multitude of dishes, and to fill vp the noumber of tenne, you diuide one matter into fower quarters, whiche is of the cōmunitie of al thinges, that was in the primitiue Churche, whiche should haue been serued all in one mease, but for fashiōs fake. That thei had all thynges common, one while in Hierusalem, it is very true, but that thei had so alwaies, and in all places, it is most false, for saincte Paule exhorteth the Corinthians, to giue almose to the poore liberally. j. Cor. xvj, and he willeth Timothe, that he charge thē that be riche, in this worlde, to be ready to distribute vnto yt necessitie of their brethren. j. Timoth. vj. which neded not all, if all thynges had been common. This was therefore a variable order, and constitution, whiche continued but a shorte tyme, neither was it profitable, but onely then, when the noumber of the disciples was but small, in comparison, and liued all in one place at Hierusalē.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Seconde in the Primitiue Church suche

of the beleuers, whiche were possessors of Landes and Houses soulde theym, and powred it doune before the Apostles, but the beleuers of this oure late reformed Churche are not come to that perfection, nor yet are aminded so to doe.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               This is all one with the former, for how could thei haue had all thynges common, if euery man had reteined his houses, and landes, to his priuate vse. And yet no manne was compelled to this communitie, for Peter saieth, plainlie, to Ananias, that he neded not to haue sold his land, neither to haue brought the price, but of his free will. But whereas you accoumpt it a perfection to haue all thynges cōmon, I muste bée bolde to tell you, ye sauour of Anabaptistrie, for although it was then expediente for thal tyme, emong a fewe, yet it were not tollerable to bee vsed as a pefection emong all the churche of Christ But would bryng a meere confusion, and disorder of all thinges, beside that it is vnpossible, that all Christian men, in all places, should haue all thynges common.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               
                  Thirdly in the primitiue churche, Christes Apostles and their successours were chiefe gouernours of the beleuers, and of such goods as they had in common amongest theim, diuision vnto euery manne was made therof, by the appoinctment of the Apostles, according as they thought it nedefull or necessarie. And because Ananias the husbande of Saphira wente aboute to kepe backe a portion of that comon mony, for the which they sould their Landes, the Apostle. S. Peter did strike theim bothe with sodaine death. But in this our reformed Englishe church, beside that the beleuers are at no suche appoinctment of the Bishoppes and successors of the Apostles, they doe by their lawes spoile theim of all they haue, by takyng from them so muche of their temporall landes, and so muche of their goods, for firste fructes, tenthes and subsidies as they liste. And therfore in this poinct it hath no agreans with the order of the Primitiue church.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               The Apostles kepte not that gouernement long in their handes, but committed it ouer to the Deacons, as it is declared

in the sixte chapiter of the Actes, by which it is manifeste, that it was no perpetuall order, whiche in so shorte tyme, was altered. For in suche thynges, the Churche maie institute, and chaunge, as often as it shall seme expediente. But whereas you charge our Prince, to bee a spoiler of the churche, by withdrawyng the landes, and gooddes thereof, by takyng firste fruictes, tenthes, and subsidies, you shewe your self what an honest subiecte your are. We for our partes, acknowledge, that it is in the Princes power, to increase, or diminishe the stipend of the ecclesiasticall ministers as shalbe thought expedient, and that it is our dueties, to paie all suche taxes, tributes, and subsidies, as by lawfull aucthoritie, are laied vpon vs. But I meruaile why you should accuse our princes, for taking of subsidies, as though Popishe princes, doe not take subsidies of their Cleargies also, and moste of all when the Pope who hath no aucthoritie, to demaunde one penie, hath extorted suche infinite sommes of money, for annates, firste fruictes, palles, pardons, and suche other tromperie: whereof how greate complaintes the

Cleargie of Englande hath made, you maie reade in Mathewe of Westminster in the liues of diuers kynges, and namely of Henry the thirde, and Edward the first. One historie is notable, that the Pope fente a Legate called Otto, with a letter, complainyng of the greate pouertie of the Churche of Rome, whiche was the cause that she was compelled, to pille, and polle poore suters, that sued to the Courte of Rome, in remeadie whereof, he demaunded of euery Cathedrall churche two prebendes, and of euery Religious house, so much as the portiō of two Mōkes, or cloisterers came to by yere. But the Cleargy would in no wise graunte it. The same requeste was made in Fraunce, but could not bee obteined. Wherefore euery man maie see, how maliciously you slander the prince, whiche hath aucthoritie to take for necessarie affaires, of the realme, so longe as a competent liuyng, remaine vnto the Ministers
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Forth it is writtē of the Primitiue church, that of suche goods which thei had in common, ther was such equall diuision made by

the handes of the Apostles, that no one man of the beliuers did lacke, or was forced of necessitie to begge. But since the reformation of this Englishe church, many especially of the Clergie which were before well able to liue, are now brought vnto a very bare and beggerly life and estate.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               This diuision lasted not longe emong the Apostles at Hierusalem, for saincte Paule from the Churches of the Gentiles, receiued almose, to supplie the necessitie of the poore sainctes at Hierusalem, and by Peter, Iames, &amp; Ihon he was exhorted so to doe, as you maie reade, in the seconde to the Galathians, and the second to the Corinth. viij. and. ix. And as for your Cleargie, if any of theim bee broughte to beggerie, it is through their owne ignoraunce, and frowardnesse, whiche either will not forsake their heresies, or are not able to minister in the Churche of Christ, if any worthie menne bee neglected, it is the faulte of some priuate persones, and not of the whole Churche.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Fiueth in the Primitiue church, christes

Apostles did baptise the beleuers onely in the name of Iesus Christe, and not by expresse woordes of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoste, the whiche forme of baptizyng vsed in the Primitiue churche, these new reformatours vse not.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               That any of the Apostles, Baptised, onely in the name of Iesus Christe, excludyng the name of the father, and of the holy ghost, it is a detestable sclaūder of the holy apostles. Who as thei had an expresse commaundement, of our sauiour Christe, to baptise in the name of the blessed Trinitie, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost, so there is no doubt, but thei did alwaies obserue it, which is easily to be gathered, out of the. xix. chapiter of the Actes where certain disciples of Ephesus, beyng vnorderly baptised, by some preposterous disciples of Ihon: aunswered thei knewe not, whether there were an holy ghost or no, sainct Paule then doeth demaunde into what thei were baptized, as though he should saie, if you had been rightly Baptized, you could not haue been ignorante of the holy ghost, but by their aunswere,

he perceiued, that thei were baptised into the name of Ihon, and not of Christe, as though Ihon had béen the head of their religiō, and not christ. Then after S. Paule had declared yt Ihons doctrine &amp; baptisme, was to bee referred altogether to Iesu Christe, thei were baptised into the name of Iesus Christe, that is to acknowledge Iesus Christ to be the heade and aucthour of their Religion, not that in the forme of their Baptisyng, the name of the father &amp; of the holy ghost was excluded. And so are all other places to be expounded, where it is saied, that any are baptised in the name of Iesus Christ. And in no place is it said, that any manne was baptised onely in the name of Iesus Christ. Wherfore this cauillation as it vnproffitable for your purpose, so is it slanderous, and blasphemous against the Apostles.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Sixte in the Primitiue Churche the Apostles, Peter, Ihon, and their Successours, did geue the holy Ghost vnto their beleuers, that were before baptized by laiyng their handes vppon their heades, whiche thinge our reformators of this our English

churche doe refuse to doe by their deniall made of the Sacrament of Confirmation.
            
            
               The Aunswere.
               Although I wil not contende with you, on what parte of mens bodies, the Apostles laide their handes, yet it is boldly affirmed of you, that thei laide their handes on mens heades, whiche you reade not in any place of the scripture, but concernyng the substance of the matter, the Apostles by the ceremony of imposition of handes conferred the holy ghost, that is to saie, the visible graces and giftes of the holy ghost, as the gifte of tongues, the gift of prophecie, the gifte of healyng and suche like, whiche giftes, as they were temporall in the Churche, to beutifie the ministery of the gospell, in the firste publishing therof, and nowe are ceased, so the ceremony by whiche thei were conferred, is rightly abrogated. For now the ministers by laiyng on their handes, can not giue those externall graces of the holie ghoste, wherefore thei ought not to vse that Ceremonie. An other imposition of handes, was vsed by the Apostles, on those that were Baptised, beyng infantes, which after thei came

to yeres of discretion, professed their faith before the Churche, to whiche thei were Baptised, and so were receiued onely by imposition of handes, whiche was therefore called confirmation. Not that it was a Sacramente, or a signe of Gods fauour, suppliyng that which wāted in baptisme, but that it was a testimonie of the Churches allowing, of those that were so Baptised, and after learned the principles of their faithe. And this Ceremonie, we retaine in our churche, not as a Sacramēte, whiche is a visible signe of an inuisible grace, betwene God and vs, but as an externall approbation, and receiuyng of the persone, in suche sorte Baptised. As for your Oile and Chrisme, that you occupie in your Popishe confirmation, hath none institution of Christe, and therefore is no Sacramente.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Seuenth the order and maner was of the Primitiue churche, if any man was dangerously sicke, to send for the Prieste, to praie for hym, and oinct hym with Oyle in the name of our Lorde God, whiche the reformatours of this our Englishe churche doe

               In the primitiue Churche, the Elders of the Churche, had the gifte of healyng, and therefore, when any man was sicke, thei vsed to sende for the Elders of the Churche, who praied for hym, and anointed hym with Oile, in the name of the Lorde, by whiche Ceremonie, it pleased GOD, to restore the partie to healthe, as you maie read in the v. Chapiter of sainct Iames. And in the sixte of saincte Markes Gospell wee reade, that the Apostles beyng sente abroade of Christe, to preache, and woorke miracles, vsed by the same ceremonie, to heale many that were sick. But now whē the gifte of healyng, continueth not in the Churche, it were a verie ridiculous thyng, to vse that Ceremonie. And as for your extreme vnction, by no meanes can be accompted that vsage, of the Apostles, for you anoint none almost, but suche as are past hope of recouerie, so farre you are frō restoring any to healthe by your beggerly ceremonie.

                  Eight in the Primitiue churche we dooe reade in the nintinth chapiter, of the actes of the Apostles, how vpon a certain plague there made vpon seuen bretheren, the sonnes of one Sceba, by a man that was possessed with the Diuelle, many of the people whiche did beleue in Iesus Christe, theruppon came and made vpen confession of their sinnes, and made declaration of their priuate actes and dedes, whiche the reformatour of this our Englishe Churche will none of, by the deniall of Sacramente of penance, and all the partes therof.
            
            
               The Aunswere.
               It is straunge to see, vnto how narrow shiftes, you are driuen, to make vp a number of argumentes. Haue you nothing but open confession, to proue your priuate and auriculer confessiōs God be thanked, ther are many also in our churche, that make open confession, and declaration of their former life, led in blindenes and superstition, of their falling in time of persecutiō and other like offences, but what is this to your popishe Sacramente, of auricular cōfession? or what likelihode hath it with the same? Firste the faithfull bringyng

forthe certeine examples of their actions, acknowledge how they were seduced by the deuill before they embraced the faith: the popes law compelleth men to reherse all their deedes, wordes, and thoughtes. These men made their cōfession once, the popes law requireth eche man to confesse euery yere once at least, these came forth to this confession of their owne accorde, the pope compelleth all men vppon necessitie of saluation. Againe the text saieth, that many came, but not all, the popes lawe excepteth none, these Ephesians made open confessiō, before al the church, as you your selfe acknowledge, the pope commaundeth euery man to whisper his confession, into a préestes eare. Let al men iudge, what agrement this their confession, hath with your auricular confession. And wheras you saie, we deny the Sacrament of penaunce, and all the partes therof. The truth is, we preache repentance, as we are commaunded, by the woorde of God, but no Sacrament of penance, dooe wee finde in the Scripture, what you meane by the partes of penance, I cannot well tell, but if it be those three, that bee

commonly sette forthe in writers of your dunsical diuinitie, contrition of harte, confession of mouth, and satisfactiō of worke, you shall here, what wée thinke of theim. Thei are suche, as a verie limme of the Deuill, maie performe, and yet goe to the Deuill, when he hath dooen. Example in Iudas Iscarioth, who hadde contrition of harte, as the Scripture teacheth, when he was sorie for his facte. And he made confession of mouthe, to the priestes, when he saied, I haue synned, in betraiyng of innocente bloode. Finally, he made satisfaction of woorke, when he restored the thirtie siluerlynges, whiche he receiued for his treason. And when he had so dooen, wente and hanged hym self in despaire. You see, that Iudas lacked none of youre three partes of penaunce, but he lacked faithe, without the whiche, all contrition, confession, and outward satisfaction is nothyng auailable. And therefore you teach a verie wholsome kinde of penaunce, in whiche faithe in the bloode of Christe, is no parte at all. Neither is it necessarely required thereto, by your owne doctrine. For Sacramentes (you teach) giue grace

                  ex opere operato, that is, of the woorke wroughte, so a manne dooeth not withstande the receiuyng of them, whiche you call ponere obicem. And therefore penaunce beyng one of your Sacramentes, and absolution of sinnes, maie be receiued without faithe, in the merites of Christ. Therfore kepe your penaunce for your frendes we can not skill of suche Sacramentes.

               Ninth the order and maner of the Primitiue churche, was to celebrate the Sacramente of christes bodie after supper, as it apeareth, both by the example geuen therof by our sauiour Christe, and by the testimonies of the Apostle sainct Paule, which they doe not obserue nor followe.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               You are not able to proue, that any suche order was established, in the primitiue Churche, that the Sacrament of the bodie, and bloode of Christe, should bée receiued after Supper. Although it was by our Sauiour institited after his laste Supper. Not appoinctyng any tyme, in whiche it ought of necessitie to bee receiued, no more then the Sacrament of Baptisme,

is bounde either to Mornyng, or Euenyng, daie, or night, or to any tyme of the daie, in whiche it was firste ordeined. And whereas you alledge the aucthoritie of saincte Paule for your purpose, you doe hym greate wronge, for he reproueth the Corinthians, for confoundyng drunken, and prophane bankettes, with the holie Sacrament of the Lordes Supper. i. Cor. xj. And as for the tyme, place, and other like circumstances, perteinyng to the ministration of the Sacramentes, thei are in the discretiō of the churche to appoinct, as thei maie beste serue for order, comelinesse, and edification. But ouer the substaunce of the Sacramentes, the Churche hath no power, as to take the cuppe from the laie people, whiche none but the churche of Antichrist would presume to doe.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Tenth in the Primitiue Churche, it was decreed by a solemne law holden by the Apostles of Christe at Hierusalem, that the christen men men shoulde absteine à sanguine, &amp; suffocato, from blood and all suffocate thinges, whiche our reformatours performe not, nor will admit any fasting from

meates and drinkes at all, by the whiche testimonies, and proues gathered out of the diuine scriptures, howe plaine a matter it is that they purpose not in their reformation to reduce vs to the Primitiue Churche of Christe, when therewith besides they haue no agreaunce, they doe all thinges cleane to the contrary, like as ye haue partlie hearde by profes made therfore out of the diuine scriptures, and shal heareafter more at large by the writinges, and testimonies of the moste best learned, and grauest fathers that euer were in Christes Churche.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               The Apostles in that Counsaile, made not a perpetuall lawe, to binde any mannes conscience, but onely a temporall decree, to auoide offence of the weake Iewes: who were accustomed to abstaine from suche thinges, and this decree, as occasion serued, was broken, and altered. But where you saie, wee can admitte no fastyng from meates, and drinkes, at all. You shall vnderstande, that we compte it no fastyng, to abstaine from one kinde of meate, and to fille your beallie with an other kinde, as to refraine fleshe, and to

glutte your stomack with fishe. Or as the Maniches abstained from liuyng creatures, and riotted in fruictes, spices, and delicate confections. Neither did the Apostles, by that decree commaunde any fastyng, but onely abstinence from bloode, and strangled beastes, whiche was offensiue to the Iewes. And for suche ende of auoidyng offences, or for ciuile pollicie, we can, and doe admitte abstinence, from some kindes of meates, and drinkes, but not for Religions sake, neither accoumptyng any suche abstinence to bee fastyng. But true fastyng, to tame the bodie, and to bryng it into subiection, to humble our selues, to make vs more apte to praie, we commende, and exhorte menne vnto it, although we make no tyrannicall lawes, to entangle any mannes conscience with all. Your féeble kinde of reasonyng, should not incurre so greate reprehension, if you had not as well in your title, as in youre conclusion, made so bolde bragges, of your plaine proofes, whiche be so plaine in dede that euery manne maie see, thei haue no force at all in theim. And whereas you threaten to shewe, that wée dooe all thynges,

contrary to the primitiue Churche, you doe well to sate, it shall bée performed in suche sorte, as you haue proued already, that wee haue none agreaunce with the same. For he that hath experience, howe pithely you haue reasoned out of the scriptures, can not but hope, that you will dispute, euen as profoundly out of the Doctours.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Argumentes gathered out of the holy Fathers and aunciente doctours, prouyng that this late reformed Englishe Churche hath no agreance with the primitiue church of Christe.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               A man maie easely perceiue, that you delight in greate nombers. For as before in your former argumentes, one matter was cutte into fower partes, to fill vp the nomber, so likewise in these argumentes without order, or dispositiō, diuers things are twise or thrise repeated. As dipping in baptisme, oile, and Chrisme, and crossyng whereas if you would haue followed any order, all these should haue made but one argument of Ceremonies, or Traditiōs.

Or if you would néedes diuide theim into their particulers, you should haue made thirtie, or fourtie argumentes of theim, and not tenne onely. But now, how well you difine the primitiue Churche (as I haue touched before) a manne maie meruaile to see: sometyme, you alledge twoo hundreth, somtyme three hundreth, somtyme fower hundreth, sometymes sixe hundreth, and at length you come almost to eighte hundreth yeres after Christe, when you alledge the seconde Counsaile of Nice, whiche was holden in the yere of our Lorde, seuen hundred eightie and one. So that the greater halfe of all the tyme, that hath passed from Christes ascention, vntil this daie, you would haue vs to take for the primitiue churche. But you know full well, that none of vs, would allowe all that tyme, for the primitiue Churche, especially when wee speake of that state, whiche we woulde haue to bee a paterne and example to all churches. Onely your purpose was, to amase your vnlearned frendes, to whom you made this apology, with the names of so manie aunciente fathers, as you rehease, and yet like a wise

man, you note but fewe places, where a man should finde their aucthorities, as you alledge theim, lest you should happen to be discredited. Whiche must needes be compted fraudulent dealyng, because you note some wherof no learned manne will doubte, and passe ouer so many, whiche séeme somwhat straunge, that any suche thinges should be, to those that parhappes haue reade, as muche of the aunciente doctours as you. But vnto all, your tenne as gumentes, I wil first oppose one answere whiche is sufficiente, to take theim all awaie, namely that suche thinges, as you bringe in, to haue been vsed, of the primitiue churche, were not in the first churche of the Apostles, whiche is moste properly called the primitiue churche, but in the latter and more corrupte age, and the further from the Apostles, the farther from sinceritie. Beside that of Ceremonies, not manifestly impious vsed in the aunciente churche, after the Apostles, the churche at al tymes after hath power, to abrogate or alter theim, as they growe to bee abused, or cease to be profitable, &amp; therefore diuersitie of Ceremonies, maketh not diuersitie

of Churches.

               Firste in the Primitiue Churche they did mixe in our lordes cuppe water with wine, and so for to doe, est lex Euangelica, &amp; traditio dominica, as witnesseth S. Cypriane, Irenaeus, Eusebius Emissenus whiche these our reformatours will none of.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               The primitiue churche obserued in the sacramēt, that, which in drinking of wine, they commonly vsed, that is to put water among the wine, to allaie the strength of it, in whiche thyng, there was no harme, so long as superstition, and opinion of necessitie was awaie, but that it should bee as you saie, lex Euangelica &amp; traditio dominica, the lawe of the Gospell, and the tradition of our Lorde, I suppose, you are not able to proue, by aucthoritie of those Doctours, whose names you recite. In deede Cypriane, verie earnestly vrgeth the law of the Gospell, &amp; the institution of Christ, for wine to bée vsed therein, againste certaine heretikes, of his tyme, whiche contended, that it should be ministered onely with water. And so he writeth lib. 2. Epist.

                        que
                     , sed vinum. That is. Knowe thou, that wee are admonished, that in offeryng the Cuppe, the tradition of our Lorde be obserued, and that none other thyng be doen of vs, then that which our lorde before did for vs. That the cuppe whiche is offred in remembraunce of him be offered mingled with wine. For seyng that Christe saieth, I am the true Vine, not water truely, but wine is the bloude of Christe. By this testimonie, it is manifeste, that Cypriane vrgeth wine, and not water, to be of the institution of Christe, and the lawe of the Gospell. But I marueile how any Papiste can bee so shamelesse, to accuse vs for takyng awaie water out of the Cuppe, whiche was no parte of Christes institution, when thei them selues are so bolde, to take awaie the cuppe altogether, whiche is the one halfe of the Sacramente, of Christes owne institution,

and continued in the Churche 1400. yeres after Christe, vntill the late Counsaile of Constance, whiche was but. 155. yeres agoen. Thei maie robbe the people of the bloodde of Christe, whiche Christe appoincted for theim, and we are heinous heretikes, for not vsing water in the Cup, whereof as there is no vse, so was there none institution. This is the iudgemente of those, that bée blinded with their owne pride, to espie a mote in an other mannes iye, and not to see a beame in their owne.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Seconde in the Primitiue Church in baptising, they vsed to dippe the partie baptized thries in the water, and S. Basile affirmeth, that it was a tradition of the Apostles, that who so euer did not so, he shoulde be deposed therfore, wheras our reformatours doe but sprincle a little water in the foreheade of the partie baptized, it may be quickly espied that thei follow not the primitiue churche.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               Our sauiour Christ, commaundeth vs to Baptise, in the name of the Father, and of the Soonne, and of the holie Ghoste,

whiche, whether it bée by dippyng the bodie into the water, or by powryng water vpon the bodie, the misticall signification of washyng, is sufficiently expressed, and so longe the Baptisme is right, as for the nōber of dippinges, is nothyng materiall. We read in the scriptures, diuers formes of washing. The Eunuche, was Baptised by Philip, goyng in naked into a Riuer or Brooke. And so Baptised Ihon in Iordan. Other that were Baptised in their houses, it is moste like that water was powred on them, as Cornelius, and them that were with hym. And the keper of the prison, with his housholde. Actes. xvj. And as for the Ceremonie of thrise dippyng, although it was vsed of many, to signifie the Trinitie, yet was it not generall, nor of any necessitie. For in the fowerth Counsaile of Toledo, it was determined, that all was one, whether a childe were Baptized with three dippynges, or with one, alone. And yet it was there decreed, vpon a good consideration, that in Spaine thei should vse but one dippyng. The woordes are these, in the fowerth Counsaile Toletane, and the fiueth Canone. Ne tamen haereticis

videamur consentire, qui tertio mergum, dum eorum morem seruamus, cautum est ne in Hispaenia, fiat baptismus, nisi in vna mersione. that is to saie. Least we should seme to agree with heretikes, whiche vse to dippe thrise, while wee reteine their maner of baptisyng, it is decreed, that no Baptisme in Spaine, bee ministered but with one onely dippyng. In this decree of the Coū
                  saile, twoo thynges especially are to bee noted. Firste, that the three dippynges was not alwaies, and in all places obserued, as a necessarie matter: and therefore your argumente is fallen to the grounde, Secondely, that it is profitable to alter, and chaunge suche Ceremoeies, as are vsed of heretikes, that wee seme not to agree with theim in any thyng, in whiche it is lawful for vs to disagree. And for this consideration, doe we refuse to dip thrise, because we would not seme to agrée with you, whiche are heretikes, although wee acknowledge, that of it self, it is a thyng indifferente, to dippe twise, or thrise, or ones, or not at al to dip, but onely to poure on water, in signe of that spirituall ablution, whiche is represented by that Sacramente

of Baptisme. Wherefore, you haue a verie quicke sight, that can espie a knotte in a Rushe, and of so small a gnat, to make so great an Elephante, as though all Christianitie stoode in thrise dippyng of a child in Baptisme, whiche I haue proued not onely, not to haue been alwaies obserued, but also by decree of a Counsaill to haue been expressely forbidden. Which Ceremonie, although it bee noumbred emong the canons, commonly called of the Apostles, yet hath he a meane iudgement in antiquitie, that can not descerne theim from Apostolike writynges. But because you bryng in the Tradition of the Apostles, you muste nedes giue me leaue, to presse you, with the same aucthoritie, and to shewe that you your self, obserue not the Traditions of the Apostles. In the vj. Canon of the Apostles, it is commaunded that no Bishoppe, Prieste, nor Deacon, shall put awaie his wife, vnder colour of religion, and thei that doe so shall be excomunicate. And in the ninthe, and tenthe Canons it is decreed, that whosoeuer is presente at the Communion, and dooeth not communicate, that he should bee excommunicate.

How these Canons of the Apostles (if you will needes haue them so called) be obserued in your Popishe Clergie, and your priuate Masse, what nede I to rehearse? And yet you agree with the primitiue Churche in all thynges, and we haue none agreaunce therewith at all.

               Thirde in the Primitiue churche they vsed Oyle and Chrisma in the ministratiō of diuers Sacramentes, which christ hymselfe did ordaine and sainctifie the night before his passion as witnesseth S. Cypriane. And his Apostles did commende the same vnto the Churche by their traditions as witnesseth sainct Basile and S. Augustine, whiche these our reformatours will none of.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               In the Primitiue Churche, there was not so many diuerse Sacramentes as you speake of, but onely the Sacramente of Baptisme, and of the bodie and bloode of christe, and in neither of these, was there any institution or vsage, of oile &amp; chrisme. And although, in the later tyme, ceremonies increased, that oyle was vsed in baptisme, yet was there not so many Sacramentes,

for Augustine saieth, vnto Ianuaerius Epis. 118. Vnde Sacramentis numero paucissimis, obseruatione facillimis, significatione praestantissimis▪ societatem noui populi colligauit, sicut est Baptismus Trinitatis nomine consecratus, communicatio corporis Christi, &amp; sanguinis ipsius, &amp; si quid aliud in scripturis canonicis cōmendatur. Wherfore (saieth Augustine) God hath bounde the societie of his newe people, with Sacramentes in number fewest, in obseruation easiest, in significatiō most excellent, as is baptisme consecrated in the name of the Trinitie, the communion of the bodie and blood of Christe, and if any thing els be commended in the Canonicall scriptures. The same Augustine and Chrisostome also vpon the water and blood that issued out of Christes side, do gather, that the Sacramentes of the church, flowed out of his side, namely Baptisme and the Supper of the Lord. Aug. Hom. in Ioann. 20. Chrysostom. ad Neophytos. Augustine also in the thirde booke, de doctrina christiana Cap. 9. rehearseth but these twoo Sacramentes, speakyng of those that are properly called Sacramentes, for otherwise both he and other auncient writers,

extende the name of Sacrament, to al ceremonies. And yet Gregorie accompteth washyng of feete to be a Sacramente, as Baptisme and the Supper, whiche is no sacramente with you. And as for the ceremonie of annointyng in baptisme, it is as lawfull for vs to abrogate, as for you to omitte the drinke of milke and Honie after baptisme, &amp; other such ceremonies, which you knowe were vsed as well as oyle and Chrisme. But our Sauiour Christe, the night before his Passion, did ordeine and sanctifie. Oyle and Chrisme for suche purposes: I meruaile what Cipriane dare be so bolde to affirme it, séeyng the Euangelistes make no mention thereof, and here againe if you hadde noted the place of Cipriane, wee might better haue considered of his aucthoritie. Diuerse writinges are set forth in his name, whiche were neuer any of his workes.

               Fowerth, S. Basile saieth, that all determiminations and instructions which are preached and kepte in the Primitiue churche of Christe, we haue receiued theim partely of the scriptures, and partly by the traditions

of the Apostles, whiche both hath like force and strength vnto godlynes. As for example, the instructions which thei haue that trust in the name of Iesus Christe, to signe them selues with the signe of Christes crosse, to praie towardes the Easte, to vse wordes of inuocation at the shewing of the Breade and the Cuppe in the holy Euchariste: to blesse the water of the Fonte, the Oyle of the holy vnction, and that he also which is baptized, should be thrise dipped in the water, and suche other like thinges whiche are taught and obserued in the Sacramente of Baptisme, as to renounce the Deuill and his angels, salte, spitle, and the exorcisme there made to the expulsion of the deuill. All these thinges, and other like whiche are tought and obserued in christes churche, we haue theim saieth sainct Basile ether of the scriptures, or els by the tradition of the Apostles, whiche are of like force and strēgth vnto pietie and godlynes, wheras the reformatours of this English church do esteme and iudge al the premises for impietie, and vngodlines.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               In this your fowerth argumente, if it

maie bee called an argumente, you huddle vp a number of Ceremonies, together, all whiche out of Basile, you would proue to bee Traditions of the Apostles. In deede Basile in the. xxvij. Chapiter of his booke De spiritu sancto, is driuē to this shifte, that either he must acknowledge many suche vnfruictfull Ceremonies, as in his tyme were crepte into the churche, to be vnprofitable, or els to flie to the tradition of vnwritten verities. The same in effecte ceaceth Augustine, and yet neither of bothe, was so ignoraunte, but that at suche time as thei did throughly consider, either the dignitie of the holie scriptures, or the natures of suche humaine Traditions, thei iudged otherwise of the whole matter. For Basile in his moralles Diffinit. xxvi. saieth.

                  . &amp;c. It is bothe conueniente, and necessarie, that euery manne far his necessarie vse, should learne out of the diuine scriptures, bothe that he maie bee certainely perswaded in his Religion, and also, that he bee not before accustomed to humaine Traditions. Let this therfore suffice for sainct Basile to aunswere hymself.
               Saincte Augustine also in his 118. Epistle, where he speaketh moste fauourably for Traditions, hath these woordes. Sed hoc nimis doleo, quod multa quae in diuinis libris saluberrimè praecepta sunt, minus curantur &amp; tam multis praesumptionibus, sic plena sint omnia, vt grauius corripiatur, qui per octauas suas terram nudo pede tetigerit, quam qui mē
                     tem

vinolentia sipelire est. But this (saieth Augustine) dooeth greue me to muche, that many thinges, whiche in Gods boke, are moste wholsemly commaunded, are lesse regarded, and all thynges are so full of presumptions, that he is more sharpely reproued, whiche hath touched the yearth with his bare foote, in tyme of his vtas, then he that hath buried his mynde with dronkennes.
               And in the same place he saieth, of Traditions: Quamuis enim ne
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      hoc inueniri possit, quomodo contra fidem sint: ipsam tamen religionem, quam paucissimis, &amp; manifestissimis celebrationum Sacramentis, misericordia dei esse liberam voluit, seruilibus oneribus premunt, vt tolerabilior sit conditio Iudaeorum qui etiam si tempus libertatis non agnouerint, legalibus tamen sarcinis, nō humanis praesumptionibus subijciuntur. that is to saie. For although this can not bee founde, how thei are contrary to the faithe, yet thei oppresse with sclauishe burdeins, the religion it self, whiche the mercie of God, would haue to bée free, with moste fewe, and manifeste Sacramentes of celebrations: So that the state of the Iewes, is more tollerable then

ours: for although thei haue not acknowledged the tyme of libertie, yet thei are subiecte to burthens laied on theim by the lawe, not to humaine presumptions.
               By this you see Augustines right iudgemente, of suche vnprofitable Ceremonies, and Traditions. Whiche althoughe Basile, and he cōiecture, and gesse to haue béen receiued of the Apostles, because thei knewe none other originall of theim, yet it dooeth not followe, that thei were deliuered by the Apostles in deede. For many of theim (if your owne aucthours dooe not lye) were instituted by diuers Popes of Rome, long after the age of the Apostles. And some it is plaine, were inuented by heretikes. For the firste that we read of, in any auncient, and authenticall writer, that hadde in reuerence the signe of the Crosse, were the Valentiniane heretikes as witnesseth Irenaeus, libri primi. Capit. 1. whiche thei called Oron crucem confirmatiuam, the strengthenyng Crosse. And abused the testimonies of sainct Paule, as you Papistes doe, where he saieth verbum crucis. &amp;c. The woorde, or preachyng of the crosse, &amp; mihi non eueniat gloriari. &amp;c. God

forbidde that I should reioyce, but in the Crosse of Christe. But afterwarde true Christians vsed that signe, to testifie vnto Heathen menne, that thei were Christians, and were not ashamed of the ignominious death of Christ, whiche the Gē
                  tiles did dispightfully caste in their teeth, and at length it grewe to a meare superstition, and laste of all, to moste horrible Idolatrie, when the Image of the Crosse was worshipped, sensed, and praied vnto.
               Praier towarde the Easte, was vsed of the Christians, in the aunciente Church, to testifie, that thei differed from the Iewes, who praied towarde the West, least thei should seem to worshippe the Sunne risyng, as the Gentiles did. And although woordes of inuocation were vsed, at the shewyng of the bread, and the Cuppe, yet was there no inuocation, of the Sacramentall breade and Cuppe, but of God.
               Of the other Ceremonies, of anoinctyng, and thrise dipping, hath been spoken before. That the Apostles vsed no suche blessyng of the water of Baptisme, as you doe, it is manifeste, when thei Baptised in euery Riuer, and Brooke that thei came

to. In dedè thei did cōsecrate the water for that time, when they vsed it to serue for ye holy vse, but did putte no holines into it which should remain after that baptisme was ministred with it, as you doe. As for the stipulatiō of renouncyng the deuill. &amp;c. is in dede ye doctrine of the Apostles. Hebr. v. (whiche we retain) although you saie in the ende, we do not. As for salte, spettle, &amp; cōiuration, or exorcisme, thei ar altogeher superfluous, at this tyme. Of exorcisme, there was some vse in the auncient churche, but of salte, &amp; spittle, which neuer are not mentioned in that place of Basile. As there were many possessed with Deuills, so there was some, that that had this power of the holie ghost, to caste out Deuils whiche were called exoreistes, as witnesseth S. Cypriane in his fowerth boke, and Epis. vij. ad Magnū. Quod hodie etiā geritur vt per exorcistas, voce humana, &amp; potestate diuina, flagelletur et vratur, et torqueatur diabolus. Et cū exire, et hoēs dei dimittere saepe dicat, &amp; in eo tamē quod dixerit fallat, &amp; id quod per Pharaonē prius gestū est eodem, mendacio obstinationis, et fraudis exerceat: Cū tamen ad aquā salutarē, at
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      ad baptismi sanctificationā venitur,

scire debemus &amp; fidere, quia illic diabolus opprimitur, &amp; homo dicatus diuina indulgentia liberatur, that is: Which thing also, is doen at this day, that by the exorcistes, through the voice of a man, and the power of God, the deuil is scourged, burned, and tormented. And although he saith oftētimes, that he goeth out, &amp; letteth go the men of God, and yet in so saying deceiueth, &amp; practiseth the same thing, that was dooen before by Pharao, with the same lye of obstinacie, &amp; deceipt: yet whē we come to the wholsom water, and sanctification of Baptisme, we muste knowe, and beleue, that there, the Deuill is oppressed, and the man, whiche is there dedicated, is by the mercie of god deliuered. This one testimonie emong a number is sufficient, to declare bothe, that there was in the Churche, menne indued with the gifte of castyng out Deuilles, whiche visibly, and sensibly did possesse menne: and that Exorcisme at Baptisme, was vsed for none other ende, but to deliuer suche as were possessed, and could not be deliuered by the Exorcistes, before thei were baptised, not yt euery persone which was Baptised hadde neede of exorcisme,

but onely suche as were vexed with vncleane spirites. And seyng that gifte of castyng out Deuilles, doeth no more continewe in the Churche, and thei that are to be Baptised, are not possessed with Deuilles, it were not onely vngodlines, but also méere madnesse, for such to take vpō them that power, whiche haue it not, or if thei had it, to exercise it, where there is no neede of it.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Fifte in the Primitiue churche thei builded churches, erected therin alters, and offfered sacrifice theron, which was a suer token and argument of the faieth of Christ, receiued like as Chrysostome writeth of Englande, howe that they had receiued the faieth of Christe, because they had builded churches, and erected Aultars in the same. S. Beade witnesseth, that sainct Augustine at the bringyng in of Christes faieth into Englande, did set vppe Aultars, wherupon the people did make their oblations, and the preste did celebrate Masse, which these our reformatours doe denie and destroie, as greate blaspemie vnto God.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               
                  For buildyng of Churches in any sumptuous maner, the primitiue church was not careful, but vntil Constantines time, continued in such places as thei could get, sometimes &amp; most commōly in caues vnder the yerth, when thei were persecuted and durste not assemble in open places. And we at this time, if we had not conueniēt places for the holie assembles would and wher suche conuenient howses lacke doe builde, Churches and Oratories. But not in the honour of Sainctes and Aungels as you doe, whiche thing the primitiue and auncient Churche, did not, but iudged it to be meare Idolatry, sacriledge, and blasphemie. As Basile in his. 141. Epistle proueth the holy ghoste to be God, because he hath a temple, so doeth Didymus in his treatise de spiritu sancto, because no creature but God onely, can haue a temple S. Augustine de vera religione, Cap. 55, saieth, concernyng sainctes. Quare honoramus eos charitate, non seruitute, nec eis Templa cōstruimus. &amp;c. Wherfore we honor theim with loue and not with seruise, neither doe we build churches vnto theim, for thei will not be so honoured of vs. Likewise in

the. 8. booke. 27. cap. de ciuitate dei, he saith, that christians builde no temples to Martyres, and in verie many other places, he writeth to the same effecte. And as for Alters and Sacrifies, the primitiue churche vsed none, more then wee. The auncient churche in deede, nameth Aulters and sacrificyng, but they meaned nothyng lesse, then suche Aulters and sacrifices, as the Papistes vse. For the fashione of their alter, whiche was the Communion Table, &amp; so called of them also, is to be seen in the Panegyricall oratiō made before Paulinus Bishop of Tyrus, wher also the fashion of their Temples is described. Euseb. lib. 10. Cap. 4. There was but one Aulter in all the Churche, whiche stoode not againste the furthest wall, at the East ende of the Churche, as your Aulters, but in the middest of the Churche, and was compassed rounde aboute with Grates or Lattesses of woodde, which were called Cancells, the Chauncel, with in whiche place so incloased, the Communion was ministred, and at the time of the ministration, the Ministers and Deacones, stoode round aboute the Aulter, whiche is a manifest proofe,

that it was not an Aulter against a wall, like youres, but a Table standyng in the middest as ours is. Laste of all, what they vnderstode by the name of sacrifice, I will discloase by one Testimonie of Chrisostome, whiche shalbe in steade of a greate number. For this he writeth vpon the. x. chapiter to the Hebrues. Hom. 17. Speaking of the sacrifice, whiche the Churche doth offer. Hoc autem quod facimus in comemorationē quidem fit eius quod factum est. Hoc enim facite inquit in meam comemorationem. Non aliud sacrificium sicut Pontifex, sed ipsum semper facimus, magis autem recordationē sacrificijeperamur. This Sacrifice (saieth he) that we doe, is done in remembrance of that whiche was doone. For he saied, doe this in remembraunce of me, we dooe not offer an other Sacrifice, as the high Prieste, but wee offer the selfe same alwaies, or rather we exercise the remembrance of that sacrifice. By this testimony of Chrisostome, it is euident, that the olde writers, when thei spake of Sacrifice, did not meane the Popishe sacrifice of the Masse, but onely the remembrance of the sacrifice of Christe, which is the ministration

of the Communion. The Testimonie of Beda, concernyng Augustine the Monke, that came into Englande, which you alleged, is neither aunciente, beyng aboue sixe hundred yeres after Christe, neither yet of auctoritie to bee followed, the same Augustine beyng a superstitious proude, cruell, and vnlearned Monke. For his superstition, Bede testifieth, his pride and crueltie is set forthe in our Englishe histories, his ignoraunce, in doubtes and questions, whiche he propoundeth to Gregorie B. of Rome.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Sixt in the Primitiue churche both men and women, made solemne vowes to the abdication of all proprietie in worldlie goodes and possessions, and also of perpetuall chastitie, as it maie appeare. Actes. 5. Math. 19 and. 1. Corinth. 7. 1. Tim. 5. Exā
                  ple wherof, was in the time of the Apostles in Iphigenia a professed virgine, whō Hirtacus Kyng of Ethiopia woulde nedes haue takē to his wife, but the Apostle S. Mathew vouched to him, that he coulde not so doe for that she had vowed her virginitie to God. VVherupon Hirtacus put the Apostle

sainct Mathewe to death, as witnesseth Abdias and others. The Canons of the Apostles doth prohibite the mariage of priestes. The counsel holden at Chalcedon and all the aunciē fathers, Dionysius, Areopagita. S. Basile. S. Ambrose. S. Augustine. S. Chrisostome, Epiphanius, and diuers others. This notwithstandyng our reformatours dooe defende suche mariages to bee lawfull and good, hauing no regarde of anie vowe or profession made to the contrarie.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               In the Actes are mentioned those, that were contente to giue their gooddes in common, but no vowe spoken of, that thei might neuer haue any proprietie of gooddes. Our sauiour Christe also speaketh of some, that had made theim self chaste, for the kyngdome of heauen, hauyng the gift of continencie, but noe vowe, that thei were bounde vnto. Saincte Paule to the i. Corinthians. vij. chapiter, commendeth Virginitie, in suche as haue the gifte, but he bindeth none with any vowes, for if a Virgine marrie, he saieth she dooeth not synne. But in the firste of Timothe. v. he entreateth of widowes, whiche as thei

were nourished by the Churche, so thei did minister vnto the Churche, and these made no vowe to God, but a promise to the churche, that thei would continue vnmarried, that thei might attende to their charge, beeyng free from housebandes, whiche saincte Paule would not haue to bee chosen vnder sixtie yeres of age, when carnall luste is paste. What is this to yonge girles, that are professed Nonnes, at fiftene, or sixtene yeres of age, before thei knowe, whether thei are able to liue chaste, without any housebande, or no? As for your fable of Iphigenia, and Hirtacus out of your newe founde olde doctour Abdias, we giue small credite vnto it: the verie names dooe sufficiently bewraie, the forgerie, whiche sounde nothyng like to the Aethiopian language. The Canons cōmonly called of the Apostles, doe excō
                  municate, a bishop, or a clearke, that doth putte awaie his wife vnder colour of Religion, as I haue shewed before. The coū
                  saile of Chalcedon Canon, xiij. forbiddeth Clerkes to marrie wiues of a contrary Religion, as Iewes, or Paganes. But not simplie forbiddeth thē, muche lesse would

allowe theim, to putte awaie their lawefull wiues. But when you proceade further, and saie, that all the aunciente fathers, dooe prohibite Priestes marriage, you are to generall: For I can bryng you some proues to the contrary. In deede the moste of the later sorte of aunciente writers, are verie muche addicte to the praise of sole life, yet was not marriage cleane taken awaie from priestes, for more then a thousande yeres after Christe. You rehearse certaine aunciente writers, and emōg them Dionysius Areopagita, of whō I must admonishe the vnlearned reader, that he is not that Dionysius whō saincte Paule at Athenes conuerted, but one of muche later tyme. For the reste of the Doctours, if you had alledged their saiynges, as you dooe their names, I should haue saied some thyng vnto theim. But that all aunciente fathers as you saie, doe not forbidde marriage of Priestes, and suche as haue vowed virginitie, you maie knowe by these examples.
               First, Tertullian was a married man, and writeth a booke to his wife. Epiphanius rehearseth many heretikes, whiche

forbadde marriage. Also of suche as had vowed virginitie, and could not keepe their vowe, he writeth Contra Apostolicos libr. 2. Tom. 1. haeres. 61. Melius est ita
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      vnum peccatum habere, &amp; non plura. Melius est lapsum à cursu, palam sibi vxorem sumere secundum legem &amp; á virginitate multo tempore poenitentiā agere, &amp; sic rurssus ad ecclesiam induci, velut qus mala operatus sit, velut lapsum &amp; fractum, &amp; obligatione opus habentem, &amp; non quotidie ocultis iaculis sauciari ab improbitate quae à diabolo ei infertur. Sic nouit ecclesia praedicare, haec sunt sanationis medicamenta. It is better therfore, to haue one sinne and not manie. It is better for hym, that is fallen from his course, opēly to take hym a wife, accordyng to the lawe, and to repente along tyme, for his virginitie, and so againe to be brought into the church, as one that hath doone euill, as one that is fallen and brused, and hath neede to bee bounde vp, and not to be daily wounded with priuie Dartes, through the improbitie which is wrought to hym by the Deuill. So the Churche knoweth to preache, these are the medicines of healyng. You see here that Epiphanius, woulde haue suche as

could not keepe their vowe of virginitie, rather to marrie, then to burne, according to the doctrine ef sainct Paule.
               Chrysostome, whose name also you reherse in his second Homelie vpon the first Chapiter of the Epistle to Titus, hath these woordes. Obstruere prorsus intendit haereticorum ora, qui nuptias damnant, ostendens eā rem culpa carere, imo ita esse pretiosam, vt cum ipsa etiam possit quispiam ad sanctum▪ Episcopatus solium euehi. That is to saie. He purposeth vtterly to stop the mouthes of heretikes, which condemne mariage shewyng how that thing is without faulte, yea to be so pretious a thing, that with it any man maie be aduaunced to the holy sée of a Bishopricke. Chrisostome therfore is not so whole on your side, as you make hym, no more is any of the auncient fathers, though it please you to abuse there names for a shewe. But who amonge all the olde writers was either a greater admirer of virginitie? or a more defacer of matrimonie, then Ierome was? and yet he writeth thus of virgines, that haue vowed continence, ad Demetriadem: Sanctum virginum propositum, &amp; caelestis angelorum
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                     
                     
familiae gloriam, quarundam non bene se aegentium nomen infamat. Quibus apertè dicendum est, vt aut nubant si se non possunt continere, aut contineant si nolunt nubere. That is, the ill name of some, that behaue not theim selues well, dooth slaunder the holy purpose of virgines, and the glorie of the heauenly family of aungelles, to whom it is openly to be spoken, that either thei doe marie, if thei can not conteine, or els that thei must conteine, if thei will not marrie. By these witnesses it is apparant, that all auncient fathers, be not of your iudgement, if wee shall beleue their owne writinges, rather then your saiynges. And cōcerning them, that haue vowed continence, if they haue any conscience of their vowe, and are able to performe it, none of vs exhorteth them to breake it. But suche as are not able to performe honestly, that whiche thei haue vowed rashely, we teach accordyng to the doctrine of sainct Paule, that it is better for them repentyng of their rashe vowes to marie, then to burne in concupiscens, then to committe fornication, and vncleanes. And this we doe not without the consent of olde writers, as partly I haue shewed,

and more coulde shewe if neede required.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Seuenth in the primitiue churche Images of Christe, his Crosse and of his sainctes, were vsed, as in Cęsarea was the Image of Christ sette vppe, by the woman whiche Christe cured of the fluxe of blood, as witnesseth Eusebius and Basilius magnus, and the generall Counsell holden at Nice, of three hundred and tenne Bishoppes, doeth constantly affirme and vouche, that the Image of Christe and of his Sanctes in the churche, were of the tradition of the Apostles. And saincte Gregorie Nyssen doeth write howe he did beholde the Image of Christes passion, and that oftentymes not without teares and weapyng. Chrisostome saieth, that he that dooeth any iniurie or valiny to the Image of Caesar, he doth cō
                  mitte the same against Caesar hymselfe. S. Beade writeth, how sainct Aug. entered into this Realme with a Crosse of Siluer, and an Image of Christe painted in a table in procession wise, singyng the Letanie, to whiche notwithstandyng, what violence, and dishonour hath been doen by our reformatours

herein this Realme, to the Image of our sauiour Christ and of his sainctes it is not vnknowen.
            
            
               The Aunswere.
               It is a proper Primitiue Churche, whiche you alledge of the seconde Counsaile of Nice, whiche was seuen hundred eightie and one yeres after Christe, holden by a multitude of Idolatrous, flatteryng, and vnlearned Prelates, whiche to feede the humor of that wicked Empresse Irene, were gathered together, not in the name of Christ, but against Christ, whose expresse commaundemente, thei did impugne. And with suche leude, and vnsensible reasons, and wrestynges of the scriptures, that if a manne of purpose, to mocke the Idolaters, woud inuente argumentes to laugh at, hee coulde not diuise more ridiculous matters. God made manne after his owne Image, ergo wee muste make Images, God is meruailous in his sainctes, ergo we must make Images. (Theodofius of Amorie reasoneth, whatsoeuer is written, is written for our learnyng, ergo wee must haue Images to teache vs.) No manne lighteth a candell,

and putteth it vnder a Bushell, ergo Images must bee sette on the Alters, with a hundreth suche substanciall proofes. And to make the matter mooste manifeste, Theodorus bishop of Myre, proueth that Images must be worshiped by his Archedeacons dreames, and so dooeth other by dreames, and miracles, and at laste, Tharasius Archebishoppe of Constantinople, with the whole Synode concludeth, that Angelles haue bodies, and mennes soules also be bodily, and therefore thei maie bee paincted. Againste this Idolatrous, vnlearned, and blasphemous Counsaile, Carolus Magnus wrote a booke, whiche is extante, in whiche he confuteth the grosse heresie, of adoration of Images.
               As for the primatiue churche of Christ, regardyng the seconde commaundement of God, did make no kinde of Images, to bee had in any vse of religion, but vtterly forbad them. As for the Image of Christ, whereof Eusebius speaketh, if it were true, was onely a monumente of the historie, sette vp in the streate, in remembraunce of the miracle, not in the churche to bee had in veneration, or worshipped.

Neither was there any Image receiued into the Churche, for three hundreth yeres after Christe. The Epistle of Epiphanius, translated by saincte Hierome, is a notable testimonie.
               
                  Cum venissem ad villam quae dicitur Anablatha, vidissem
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      ibi praeteriens lucernam. &amp;c. When I came to a village, whiche is called Anablatha, and sawe there as I passed by, a candell burnyng, and inquiryng what place it was, and vnderstandyng that it was a Churche, I entered in, to praie, and founde there a vaile, or linnen clothe, hangyng at the doore of the saied churche, stained, and painted, and hauyng an Image as it were of Christ, or of some saincte. For I dooe not well remember, whose Image it was. Therefore when I sawe, this thing, that the Image of a man was hanged vp, in the Churche, contrary to the aucthoritie of the Scriptures, I did rende it in péeces, and gaue counsaile to the kepers of that place, rather to wrappe it about some poore bodie that was deade, to burie hym with all. Contrariwise, thei murmured, and saied. If he would néedes rende it, it were reason, he should giue vs

an other vaile for it, and so chaunge it. Whiche thing when I heard, I promised, that I would giue theim one, aad sende it shortlie. There passed not long tyme, but that I sought to sende theim a verie good vaile for it. For I thought that one shoulde haue been sente me out of Cypres. And nowe I haue sente suche a one, as I could gette. And I praie you to commaunde the Elders of that place, to receiue that Vaile of this bearer, whiche is sente by vs. And to giue theim charge, that hereafter in the Churche of Christe, suche vailes bee not hanged vp, whiche are contrary to our Religion. This writeth Epiphanius to Ihon bishoppe of Hierusalem, by whiche it is euidente, what was thought of Images, at that tyme, when a painted vaile, might not bée hanged before a Churche doore, to keepe out the winde, or for some suche purpose, and not in any respect of religion, or worshipping. The same Epiphanius, emong the heresies of Carpocrates rehearseth, that he made priuilie the Image of Iesu, &amp; Paule Homer, and Pithagoras, and worshipped them. Also he inueigheth sharply against

the Antidicomarians, and Collyridians, for vsyng, and worshippyng the Image of Marie the Virgine. As for your testimonies, out of Gregorie Nyssene, and Chrysostome, serue nothyng to the purpose, for Gregorie speaketh not of the historie of Christes passion, as you vntruely report, but of the oblation of Isaac, by his father Abraham. Conc. Nicen. 2. actione. iiij. But this picture was in some priuate place, not in the Churche, and place of worshippyng.
               And Chrysostome in his saiyng, concludeth not, that therefore we must haue Images of GOD, and of Christe in the Churche, but he that doeth iniurie to any manne, that is made after the Image of god, or disobeieth a Magistrate, which representeth the persone of God. &amp;c. He doth iniurie to God. For he that maketh any Image of God, doeth God greate iniurie, transformyng the glorie of the inuisible GOD, into the shape of any corruptible creature. Rom. j. But what Chrysostome and diuers other godlie fathers, thought of the vse of Images, in the churche, is exdressed in the counsaile of Ephesus, which

condemned Images before the Counsaile of Nice, whiche restored theim. And the Counsaile Elibertinum, fower hundreth yeres before that, vnder Constantine the greate, made this decree. Capt. xxxvi. Placuit picturas in ecclesia esse non debere, ne quod colitur aut adoratur, in parietibus depingatur. That is. It is thought good, that pictures ought not to bée in the Churche, leaste that thyng, whiche is worshipped, and honoured, should bee painted on the walles. To conclude, that whiche you alledge out of Beda, concernyng Dan Augustine the Monke, I will aunswere by the aucthoritie of sainct Augustine the Bishoppe: who in his boke De consensu Euāgelistarum libr. i. Capit. 10. Speakyng of certaine Heathen aduersaries, whiche noumbred Paule emong the twelue Apostles, that were with Christe, while he liued, writeth in these woordes. Credo quod pluribus locis simul eos cum illo pictos viderunt, quià merita Petri, &amp; Pauli etiam propter eundem passionis diem celebrius, &amp; solemniter Roma commendat. Sic omnino errare meruerunt, qui Christum, &amp; Apostolos eius, non in sanctis codicibus, sed in pictis parietibus quaesierunt. I beleue that in

many places thei sawe theim painted together with hym, because the Citie of Rome, commendeth the worthinesse of Peter, and Paule, more notably, and solemnely, because of the same daie of their sufferyng. So altogether thei were worthie to bée deceiued, whiche sought Christ and his Apostles, not in the holie scriptures, but in painted walles. And so all thei that followed your Augustines superstitions, were iustely blinded, and deceiued, because thei sought not Christ in the scriptures, but in painted Tables, whiche is the punishemente due for Idolatrie, as sainct Paule testifieth.

               Eight in the primatiue church the maner of fastyng was merueilous streight, in so much that Faustus Manicheus. 1300. yeres agoe, did taxe the christiane men, that they should in tyme of Lente, absteine from all meate, that is spoken of by the Apostle. S. Paule in the first to Timothy the fowerth Chapiter. And did blaspheme the doyng and teachyng of Christes churche to be doctrinam daemoniorum. But Ierome vpon the same place doth make answere, like as sainct

Augustine in manie places, that the church in their fasting to absteine from meate, not therby to condemne any kynde of meate, as Manichaeus did, but for penance, and to subdue the carnall concupiscens, and suche other like good purposes▪ And farther for the streight fasting in the primitiue Churche. S. Iheronime writeth ad Nepotianum, Epiphanius in Anchorato, whiche is nowe thought of these reformatours to be superfluous and folishe, and therfore they mind not to reduce and bring vs to the order of the primitiue churche.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               Concernyng Fastyng, I haue spoken sufficiently, in aunswere of your tenth argumente, out of the scriptures, where you make mention of fastyng also. Euseb. lib. v. Capit. xviij. Testifieth that Montanus the heretike, was the firste that prescribed lawes of fastyng, whom you followe altogether. And especially the heretikes call Archontici, of whom Epiphanius writeth lib. i. Tom. iij. Here. 40. whiche pretended fastyng, but obserued none in deede, and the Manichees of whom S. Augustine testifieth, that vnder colour of abstinence,

thei refrained from eatyng of any liuyng thyng, and from drinkyng wine, yet did thei glutte, and pamper theim selues with delicate frutes, and spices, with drinke made of the iuice of Dates, &amp;c. such was your Popishe faste: on Fridaies at Dinner, to eate no fleshe, but as muche fishe, as the beallie would holde, with good store of wine, at night to eate no liuyng creatures, but Figges, Reasons, Almondes, Wardens, and Quinces baked, Suckette, and Marmelade, and other fruites conserued with good wine, or Hipocras to helpe digestion. This was a straight kind of faste, yet this was Catholicke enough, so long as greate Prelates vsed it.

               Ninth in the primitiue churche, they vsed praier for the soules departed, whiche was the tradition of the Apostles, as witnesseth Dyonysius Areopagita de caelesti Hierarchia. Cap. 7. Epiphanius Chrisostom in. 1. ad Cor. Hom. 41. &amp; in Math. 33. &amp; Hō. 69. ad populum Antiochenum, whiche thinge is proued also by the Scriptures, affirmed of all auncient writers, and hath alwaies been continued in Christes Churche, and

now denied and taken awaie by oure reformatours, and therefore they minde no to reduce vs to the primitiue churche.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               I must needes confesse, that praier for the deade, is one of the oldeste heresies, that the Papistes doe maintaine, and yet hath it no aucthoritie of Gods worde, nor of the primitiue Churche, for twoo hundreth yeres after Christe. Thei vsed in deede, to make mention of theim, at the celebration of the Communion, and to giue God thankes for them, whiche some tyme is called a Sacrifice offered for thē, as of Cypriane. Lib. iiii. Epist. v. Speaking of Martyres, of whom none doubteth, but thei were in heauen, and neded no praiers to bee made for them. Sacrificia pro eis semper vt meministis offerimus, quoties martyrum passiones &amp; dies anniuersaria commemoratione celebramus. That is: Wee offer Sacrifice for theim alwaies, as you remember, so often as wee celebrate the passion, or dayes of the Martyres, by yerely commemoration. But this vnproper kinde of speakyng, and bolde attemptes, without scripture to name the deade in the Communion,

did bréede in the posteritie, many errours, as praier for the deade, the Sacrifice of the Masse for the deade, Purgatorie, and suche other. But in this nineth argumente, you bewraie your fraudulent dealing in the other, for here you note the places of the doctours, whiche you knowe no manne will denie, and in other places, where you affirme, that none of vs will graunte, you alledge their names onely, without quotyng the places.

               Tenth in the Primitiue churche christen men were taught, to arme them selues with the signe of the Crosse, whiche consignatiō of the Crosse was vsed in the administration of the Sacramentes, and that of necessitie, as sainct Augustine saieth: wordes also of inuocation before the consecration of the Sacrament of the Aulter, were vsed in the primitiue churche, like as the sanctifiyng of the Fonte, the blessyng also of the Chrisme and Oyle, to annoincte the partie baptized, all which thinges were of the traditions of the Apostles, as witnesseth Basili. sainct Cyprian, sainct Augustine, Damas, and many other▪ whiche thinges beeyng

now vtterly abolished by the newe reformatours, they purpose not to bring vs to the order of the Primitiue churche. Seeyng therefore it can not bee denied by so many testimonies gathered out of the diuine Scriptures, and holy fathers, that they agree not with the primitiue churche of christe, but doe dissent and are cleane gone from it, in so many diuerse poinctes as I haue expressed. Therefore this their reformation to reduce vs to the primitiue churche, is onely pretended of their partes and shall neuer be proued.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               You leape to, and fro, backwarde, and forwarde, more like to one that daunseth, then that disputeth, Haue wée not hearde enough before, of crossyng, and blessyng, of Oile, and Chrisme? But thei must now be repeated againe, whiche if thei were graunted to you, and vsed of vs, as thei were in tyme of those doctours, whose names you recite, what had you gained ther by? It is your blasphemous doctrine, that me doe moste abhorre, and your Ceremonies, we hate the more, for your doctrines sake. You should therefore stande to the

defence of your doctrine, and not fight so egerly for your Ceremonies, if you would vse good pollicie. Nowe for these obseruations, I haue aunswered before sufficiently, by whiche, as by the reste of myne answeres, I truste it shall appeere, to euery manne of indifferente iudgemente, that notwithstandyng, all your twentie argumentes of bothe sortes, our Churche hath suche conformitie, and agremente with the primitiue Churche of Christe, that she maie bee truely compted a member of the same, and partaker in the communion of all the sainctes of God.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Of what force, streingth, and estimatiō those thinges are of, whiche haue been vsed in christes catholike churche, it shal appeare by these testimonies of sainct Augustine followyng.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               Before you had spoken of the force of those matters, you should haue doen well to haue considered the force of your argumentes, whiche, howe stronge so euer those thinges bee, are to weake to proue that, whiche you propounde, namely.

that our Churche hath none agreaunce at all, with the Primitiue Churche of Christe. But seyng you will needes sette for the dignitie of these matters, wee will seuerally consider, all these fower argumentes.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Firste sainct Augustine writyng againste the Donatistes, saieth, looke what thinges the vniuersall church of christe obserue, and hath at all tymes obserued, if the same bee not ordeined by any generall counsell, thē it ought most firmely to be beleued, that it came to vs onely by the auctoritie, and tradition of the Apostles.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               Although I knowe what to thinke of vnwritten Traditions, yet if you bee able to proue, that al these thinges wherof you speake, the vniuersall Churche of Christ, doeth, and hath alwaies obserued, I will yelde to you, that thei are the Tradition of the Apostles, accordyng to your testimonie, whiche if you canne not doe, (as I am well assured, you will neuer bee able to dooe it) by your owne reason, and aucthoritie, we neede not holde theim for

Traditions of the Apostles, nor yet decrees of generall Counsailes.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Second sainct Augustine in hys Epistle ad Casulanum, saieth, how in all these thinges, whereof the Scriptures hath made no certeine determination, the maner of the people of god▪ or decrees of our elders, must be taken and holden as a lawe to gouerne our selues, and in the same Epistle he maketh mention how the Sondaie, because it is not fasted, whiche fastyng is a Sacrifice acceptable to God▪ Therefore saieth he, the Sondaie maie not bee celebrated and kepte without an other Sacrifice whiche is acceptable to God.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               The Scripture hath determined of all necessarie articles of faithe, and againste all superstitious opinions, and Ceremonies. And these thynges you speake of, we proued to bee suche, therefore in theim by Saincte Augustines rule, neither the custome of people, nor the decrees of elders muste take place, but the aucthoritie of Goddes woorde. But of suche thynges as bee variable Ceremonies, for edification,

order, and comelinesse sake, diuers particuler Churches, maie make particuler decrees, whiche are nothyng preiuditiall to the vniuersall Churche of Christ, whiche is the principall argumente that saincte Augustine handeleth, in that 86. Epistle to Casulanus, where he defendeth the custome of the moste parte of the Churche, againste the custome of the Churche of Rome. As I haue touched before, whiche thyng, of you will in no wise bee allowed. And as concernyng the Sacrifice he speaketh of, to bee celebrated on Sondaie, he meaneth not the propiciatorie Sacrifice of the Masse, as perhaps you would seme to inferre. But the celebration of the communion, for thus he writeth in the same Epistle against Vrbicus. Dicit cessisse pani pecus, tanquam nesciens &amp; tunc in domini mensa, panes propositionis poni solere, &amp; nunc se de agni immaculati corpore partem sumere, dicit cessisse poculo sanguinem, nō cogitans etiam nunc se accipere in poculo sanguinem. He saith that the Shepe hath giuen place to the breade, as though he were ignoraunt, that then also the Shewbread, was vsed to bée sette on the Lordes boarde, and that now

also he taketh parte of the bodie of the immaculate Lambe: he saieth that bloodde hath giuen place to the Cuppe, not consideryng that now also, he receiueth bloode in the Cuppe. These woordes declare, bothe that the Sacrifice was nothyng but the Communion, and also that the wine is none otherwise called bloodde, then the bread is called a lambe, and that the bread in nature, and substaunce is suche, as was the Shewbreade, in whiche was no transubstantiation, and thirdely, the necessitie of the Communion in both kindes, if this analogie of Augustine must stande, wherfore sainct Augustine in this Epistle, maketh little for your purpose.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Thirde saincte Augustine in his thirde Epistle ad Ianuarium saieth, that the thinges whiche we doe obserue throughout the whole worlde, beyng not written, but deliuered vnto vs, either from the Apostles or generall counselles (the aucthoritie wherof is notable) and as of theim receiued, ought to be obserued, as the yerely remembrance and feastes of the passion of Christe, of his ascention into heauen, and of the cōmyng

of the holy ghost, whiche are celebrate in the Churche of Christe, or any other like thing whiche is vniuersally obserued from whatsoeuer it first came fro, and therefore saieth sainct Augustine in the same Epistle, to reason or dispute why the same thinge ought to be obserued, whiche of long tyme hath been obserued throughout the whole world, by the auctoritie of christes church, insolentissima insania est, it is a poincte saieth he of extreme madnes. And therfore saieth saincte Aug. the chaunge made of so long a custome, yea though the same shoulde be verie profitable, yet by the newnes thereof it doeth vexe and trouble the Churche of Christe, it is made vnprofitable, vnfruictful and finally hurtfull to the church of christ, and for an example therof, he doth there alledge how the disciples of christ did receiue the body and blood of christe, not fastinge but after supper, is the vniuersall church of christe therefore to be reproued, or the custome therof to be chaunged, whereby wee do in the same, receiue the body and blood of christe fastyng, and that for a more reuerence therunto, in preferryng the foode of the soule, before the foode of the bodie?

doubtles so for to doe it, shoulde bee after the minde of Augustine, both hurtfull vnto the churche of christ, and a greate ponct of madnesse.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               This testimonie in effecte, is the same with the former. Sainct Augustin would haue suche Traditions, as haue alwaies been vsed in the Churche, to bee supposed, that either thei came from the Apostles, or from the generell Counsailes: but here wee haue, diligently to consider, that wée admitte not all suche thynges, as are called Traditions, but onely suche as are vniuersally, and haue been alwaies vsed in the Churche. Secondely, that thei bee not contrary to the doctrine of the Apostles, conteined in the holie scriptures, for then it is moste certaine, thei are no Traditions of the Apostles, for thei did not deliuer one thyng in writyng, and a contrary thyng in Tradition. Thirdly, that whatsoeuer Tradition of the Apostles, is not conteined in the scriptures, although wee knewe it came from the Apostles, it is lawfull vpon good consideration to alter it. For seyng that all necessarie matters,

are conteigned in the scriptures, whatsouer thei deliuered, whiche is not conteined in the scriptures, was but temporall, &amp; might be chaunged, aswell as the decree De sanguine et suffocato, of blood, &amp; strangled.
               And that we ought not to receiue, whatsoeuer is commended to vs, as a Traditiō of the Apostles, maie appere by these exā
                  ples. Irenaeus was a manne that liued nere to the age of the Apostles, for he sawe, as he hymself doeth testifie, Polycarpus the disciple of sainct Ihon. And he declareth that it was a Tradition, commonly receiued in Asia, as of sainct Ihon the Apostle, and of other of the Apostles, that our sauiour Christe liued fiftie yeres, whiche is contrary to the truthe of the Gospell. Irenaeus libri. 2. Cap. xxxv. If suche a fable could bee credited, for an Apostolike Tradition, so sone after the Apostles departure, what maie bee iudged of those, that in two hundreth, three hundreth, fiue hundreth, sixe hundreth, eight hundreth yeres after the Apostles, were not heard of, but sodainlie were sette out in the worlde, as Traditions of the Apostles. Eusebius also reporteth, libri. v. Cap. xviii. that it was alledged

as a Traditiō of the Apostles, that Christ commaunded theim, not to departe from Hierusalem, twelue yeres after his ascension, whiche is manifestly contrary to the the historie of the Actes of the Apostles. Tertuliane after he was fallen into the errour of the Montanistes, voucheth the Tradition of the Apostles, against the Catholikes, whom he calleth Psychicos, that is, animales, naturall men, and not spirituall.
               
                  Ieronime in Euangel. Math. libr. 4. Cap. xxv. declareth that it was a Tradition emong the Iewes, that Christ should come at midnight, whervpon he gathereth, that the Tradition of the Apostles was deriued, that on Easter eue, the people should not depart out of the churche, before midnight, but tary there for the commyng of Christ. A likely matter, that the Apostles would make a Tradition, of the erroure of the Iewes. The same Ieronyme vpon the firste Chapiter of Agge saieth verie well of the Apostolicall Traditions: Sed &amp; alia quae abs
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      auctoritate, &amp; testimonijs scripturarum quasi Apostolica traditione sponte reperiunt at
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      confingunt, percutit gladius dei. But other thinges also (speakyng of heretikes)

whiche thei finde out, and feigne of them selues, without the aucthoritie, and testimonies of the scriptures, as it were by Tradition of the Apostles, the sworde of God dooeth strike. By these examples, and testimonies, it is manifeste, that wée must not by and by, receiue what soeuer is saied, to be a Tradition of the Apostles.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Fowerth saincte Augustine in his thirde Epistle ad Ianuarium, in speakyng of these thinges, whiche in diuerse partes are obserued in christes Churche diuersely, he geueth that certeine and sure rule, that if thei be not against the professed faieth of christes churche, nor against the good liuyng and maners of men, but haue in theim some maner of encouragement of a better life, wheresoeuer saieth he we dooe knowe anie such thing diuersely to be vsed, we shal not only not disalow theim, but also folow thē, with praise, and innouation of life. So that the infirmitie and weakenes of some men be not let therunto. when otherwise if more profette maie come therby vnto the good, then hurte vnto the weake offended therby, sine dubitatione faciēda sunt, without doubte

(saieth he) al suche although thei be diuerse, and in diuerse places diuersely obserued, yet they ought to be continued and kepte.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               Wée agree with sainct Augustine, that suche Ceremonies as are instituted for order, and comelinesse sake, beyng diuers in diuerse churches, if thei be not contrary to the Scriptures, are to bée obserued of suche, as remaine in those Churches. And what this should make, either for you, or againste vs, I dooe not sée at all. For your Ceremonies, are voide of edifiyng, vnorderly, vndecent, for the churche of Christ, and then the opinion of merite, and satisfaction, that you ioigne vnto them, beyng contrary to the Christian faithe, and the aucthoritie of the Scriptures, maketh thē to be vtterly abhominable. Furthermore when you make them essentiall partes of the religion, and worshippe of GOD, our sauiour Christe hym self, out of the Prophete Esaie, doeth vtterly condemne thē. For GOD will not be worshipped, with the doctrine, Traditions, and preceptes of menne. Matth. xv. Thus neither your ten reasōs, out of the scriptures, nor your ten

argumentes out of the doctours, nor your fower bulwarkes out of S. Augustine, are able to defende your Popishe churche from ouerthrowe, whiche if she take vpon her, to encounter with the truthe, muste needes bée discomfited, and come to vtter destruction.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Besides that this refourmed Englishe churche, hath no agreaunce with the catholike churche of christe, the religion thereof doeth onely stande of negatiues, like as it shall appeare in the processe followyng.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               Besides that your Rhetorike in railyng on our Churche, is verie vnreasonable, your Sophistrie it self, in quarellyng againste vs, is voide of sufficient subtiltie: not onely to defende it self, but at leaste wise, to hide it self. For what impudente kinde of arguing call you this: by enumeration of a fewe particulers, to conclude any vniuersall proposition? These newe reformators deny twentie thynges, whiche the Papistes affirme, ergo, their religion standeth onely of negatiues. Maie not I likewise reason, the Papistes denie

fourtie thynges, that the Protestauntes affirme: Ergo the Religion of Papistes, standeth onely vpon negatiues. Furthermore, whē euery affirmatiue proposition implieth a negation of his contradictorie, and euery negatiue propositiō, importeth an affirmation of his contradictorie, you maie as well saie, that it standeth altogether vpon affirmatiues, as you dooe, vpon negatiues. Like as in the tenne commaū
                  dementes of GOD, onely twoo are affirmatiue, and eight are negatiue, wherein all the duetie of a Christian manne consisteth, you might reason, that Gods commaundementes stande almoste all of negatiues, as though God did onely tell vs, what we should not doe, and did not teach vs, what wée should dooe, like as you conclude afterward, vpō the sale of Clare the Butchers horse: but that right reason telleth vs, that the prohibitiue Commaūdementes, are also preceptiue, and the preceptiue commaundementes, are also prohibitiue, for he whiche forbiddeth adulteterie, commaundeth a chaste life, and he whiche commaundeth to honour our parentes, forbiddeth vs to disobey the same.

But because faithe, whiche is the foundation of religion, is an affirmation of those thinges, whiche are beleued, to proue that our Religion standeth not all vpon negatiues, but chiefly vppon affirmatiues, it shall bée sufficiente to declare that we beleue, and affirme all the articles of the Christian faithe, and what soeuer is affirmed in the woorde of God as truthe, like as wee denie all falshode, and vntruthe. We beleue, and affirme, that there is but one GOD: wée affirme that in this God-heade, there are three persones distincte, but not diuided. Wee affirme that the sonne of God was conceiued by the holie Ghoste, borne of the virgine Marie, and so foorthe, as it followeth in the Crede, by whiche it is manifeste, that our Religion standeth not all in negatiues.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Saincte Augustine doth define religion to be cultus diuinus a diuine seruice dew vnto God, wherby as Isidore saieth, wee dooe binde our selues to the worshipyng of God with a full purpose and intente to serue God. True religion beyng in this wise put in a dewe worshippe and seruice to be doen

vnto GOD, the late begonne religion of this reformed Churche, can not bee the true religion of GOD, for as muche as it doeth not consiste in any action or seruice more now vnto God then was before, but onely this religion standeth as I suppose by negatiues, by an ouerthrowe and subuersiō makyng of all thinges before appoincted for the gouernement of his people, both in the olde Testament and newe, some preceptes whiche were morall, some iudiciall, some ceremoniall, also sacrifice and sacramentes, the doctrine of this newe religion and reformed Churche, whiche as I saied dooeth stande onely or wholy by negatiues doeth denie.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               I will not stande in argumente with you, whether this be a full difinition of religion, whiche you alledge out of Saincte Augustine. It is not by and by, a diffinitiō of Religion, whiche maie bee truely saied of Religion. But what should moue you to thinke, that our Religion teacheth not menne to worshippe God? When we onely teache, the right kinde of Gods seruice, sette forthe in his woorde, whereas you,

and all other heretikes, worshippe God after the preceptes of menne, which is no religion but superstition. You saie our religion doth not consist in any action or seruice, more nowe vnto God then was before, but howe true this is, let euery man iudge, when we ascribe all religious seruice, obedience, honour, faieth, inuocation, and thankes geuyng, onely to God by our sauiour christe: wheras you giue the greatest parte thereof to creatures, some to Images, some to sainctes departed, some to your owne merites, some to your beggerlie Ceremonies. Let euery man therefore iudge, whether our religion giue not more to God in Christ then you, when we giue all to God, the onely aucthour of all goodnes, and Christe our only mediatour of all benefites to bee receiued of God, and you giue him but parte of al the seruice that is due to hym, and make so many mediatours beside our sauiour Christe. Finally, wher as you charge vs, with the subuersiō of the preceptes moral, ceremonial and iudiciall, of Gods lawe it is a straunge matter to see your boldnes. What morall preceptes of God doe we gainsaie? doe wee

not teache menne to obserue all the tenne Commaundementes? And what Ceremonial lawes remaine there, to vs which were not vtterly abrogated by Christ? As for the iudiciall preceptes of the Iewishe lawe, who euer required the christians to be bounde vnto theim? The onely propiciatorie sacrifice of Christes Passion, wee embrace, &amp; al Sacramentes of christes institution. Wherfore we neither stande al vppon negatiues, neither denie we anie thing, that we ought to affirme as true.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               First it denieth that the morall preceptes are possible to be kepte of man.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               It shal not be néedefull our doctrine, beyng so commonly knowen to the worlde, to make a large discourse, vpon euery one of these negatiues, but onely to declare briefly, how we denie them, and to shewe a reason of our deniall. We denie in deede that it is possible for any manne, excepte Christe onely, to keepe the morall preceptes of God. Which is not suche a straunge paradoxe, to any man that is not a starke hypocrite, but his owne conscience will

testifie the same vnto hym. The morall preceptes are conteined in these twoo poinctes, as our sauiour testifieth: Thou shalte loue the Lorde thy GOD, with all thy harte, with all thy soule, with all thy strengthe, and thy neighbour as thy self. Who is so paste all feare of God, that he dare affirme, that he is able to performe this? Againe, what is the cause, that the scripture dooeth so often pronounce, that no man can be iustified by the woorkes of the lawe? but because no manne can fulfill the lawe. Whiche if a man could performe, he should liue therein, and haue eternall saluation without Christe, but no man can bee saued without Christ, therefore no manne can fulfill the lawe. For the lawe was giuē, to shewe vs our weakenesse, and so to bring vs to Christ.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Seconde it denieth that any iudgement in spirituall causes, or in the high courte of conscience, is to be geuen to the Prieste.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               The high courte of conscience, is Gods owne iurisdiction, the iudgement whereof, perteineth neither to Prieste, nor laie

manne, but to God alone. But in causes spirituall, to iudge according to the worde of God, wee dooe not deny, but it pertaineth to Ecclesiasticall persones, from whiche rule of iustice, if any of theim departe, he is subiecte to the correction, and punishemente of the Ciuile Magistrate, As Aaron had his aucthoritie of iudgemēt in Spirituall causes, yet was he reproued by Moises. And Abiathar the high Priest, was deposed by Salomon, and Sadoc sett vp in his place. And should not Ahaz, if he had been a godlie Prince, haue deposed Vriah, for makyng the prophane alter?
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Thirde it dooeth denie all kinde of Ceremonies.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               Wee denie all kinde of Ceremonies, that are of mannes inuention, to worship God, or to merite saluation by them. For in the worshippe of God, wee muste dooe onely that he commaundeth vs. Other Ceremonies that are onely for order, and decencie, ordeined in the Churche, wée receiue, as I haue often shewed before.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               
                  Fowerth it doeth denie the sacrifice of christes Testamente.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               The Sacrifice propitiatorie, that onely taketh awaie the synnes of the worlde, is the Sacrifice, whiche Christe offered ones for all, vpon the aulter of the crosse, and thereby makyng perfecte for euer, those that are sanctified, can not be repeated, without horrible iniurie dooen vnto the Passion of Christe, and the merites thereof. Hebr. vij. ix. x. and almost through out the whole Epistle. In deede the Sacrifice of the Masse▪ if it bee the Sacrifice ye meane, wée vtterly deteste, as blasphemous, and abhominable. For whiche you haue neither commaundemente, nor example of Christe, what soeuer you pretende, by these woordes of our Sauiour, Dooe this in remembraunce of me. For besides that, to celebrate the remēbraunce of Christe in the Sacramente, hath nothyng to dooe with a Sacrifice, by those woordes it is easie to proue, that you can offer vp no Sacrifice, in the celebration of the Sacramente. For by this woorde of Christe (dooe this) you can dooe no more,

but that whiche Christe then did. But Christe did then offer no Sacrifice of his bodie, therefore you can offer no Sacrifice of his bodie. That Christe did then offer no Sacrifice of his bodie, is manifeste by the Apostle to the Hebrues, whiche often tymes testifieth, that he offered hym self but ones, whiche was on the Crosse, Chapit. vij. ix. x. therefore he did not offer hym self on the table at his supper, as you moste falsely surmise.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Fifte it dooeth denie the Sacramentes of christes churche.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               Wee receiue the Sacramente of Baptisme, and of the Lordes Supper, which onely wee finde in the scripture, the other fiue, whiche you call Sacramentes, because we finde theim not in the scripture, instituted of Christe, in the nature of Sacramentes, we dooe not receiue theim as Sacramentes. Matrimonie, Confirmation, election of Ecclesiasticall ministers, with their aucthoritie, as wee finde theim by the woorde of God, so wee retaine the pure institution of theim, refusyng the

corruption, and superstition builded vpon them, by Antichriste. Extreme vnction, is an idle Ceremonie, and nothyng pertainyng to our tyme, as I haue declared before, &amp; for that cause is iustely abrogated.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Sixte it doth denie the real presence of christes bodie and blood in the holy Eucharist.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               Wée dooe not denie the reall presence of Christes bodie, to the faithe of him that receiueth worthely. But the carnall, and grosse immagination of transubstanciation, whiche is contrary to the scriptures, whiche teacheth that the bodie of christe, is like vnto our bodies, in all thynges, synne excepted, and therefore can not bee in diuerse places at one tyme, and is also contrary, to the doctrine openly taught in the Churche, for seuen or eight hundreth yeres after Christe. For Bertramus did write his treatise, as some thinke, to Carolus Caluus, whiche liued eight hundreth yeres after Christe.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Seuenth it dooeth denie that Christes Churche is visible or possible heare to bee

knowen.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               We denie, that the Churche of Christ is visible, to the worlde, at all tymes, because our sauiour Christ prophecieth, that the moste parte of the worlde should bee deceiued by false Prophetes. Math. xxiiij. and S. Paule prophesieth, of the generall apostasie, that should bee made by Antichriste. Sainct Ihon also in the Reuelation sheweth, that the Churche should flie into the wildernesse, and all the worlde should worshippe Antichriste. Apoca. xij. and. xiij. Wherefore the Churche is not alwaies in sight of the worlde, although it bee sometyme deliuered from suche extreme persecution, as it is, God bee thanked at this tyme.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Eight it doeth denie the free choise and will of man.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               Wée affirme, that Adam by his falle, loste the fredome of his will, bothe in him self, and from his posteritie. So that a mā hath nowe no freedome of will, so muche as to thinke a good thoughte. ij. Corin. iij.

much lesse to do we any good of our selues. Whiche seeyng it is the iuste iudgemente of God, vpon Adam, and his posteritie, for synne, we make not God aucthour of euil, as prophane dogges doe barke against vs, or rather against God, but iuste in all his iudgementes, and holie in all his waies. But of free wille, I shall haue occasion to speake more hereafter, toward the latter ende of your discourse.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Ninth it dooeth denie our iustification by penance, by Baptisme, by hope, by charitie and good workes.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               Wée affirme with saincte Paule, that a manne is iustified before God by faithe, without the deedes of the lawe. Rom. iij. not that deade faithe, whiche saincte Iames speaketh of, but a liuely, and fruictefull faithe, that woorketh by loue. But of iustification, I muste speake more hereafter.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Tenth it dooeth denie the merites of all good workes, Gods promises made to the contrarie notwithstandyng.
            
            
               
               The aunswere.
               Wee affirme, that all good woorkes, shall be rewarded by God, for his promise sake, but neither for worthines of them, nor for the worthines of vs. For the worthinesse of theim, deserueth nothyng, because thei are vnperfecte. And our worthinesse in doyng theim, dooeth merite nothyng, because thei proceade of God, and not of vs, and secondly, because our synnes are many more in noumber, then our good deedes. And when we haue dooen all that wee are bidden, wee are vnprofitable seruauntes, Luke the. xvij. therefore wee deserue nothyng by theim, but that GOD of his infinite mercie, vouchsaueth for his promise sake in Christe, to accepte them, and reward them.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Eleuenth it doeth denie fastyng from any one kinde of meate more then an other, or vpon this daie more then an other.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               To teache men to abstaine from meates, and marriage, is the doctrine of Deuilles. j. Timo. iiij. Otherwise true faste we deny not, but affirme, and commende

as hath been declared ones, or twise before.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Twelft it doeth denie tyme and daies of watches and praiers.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               We deny the superstitious obseruation of daies and tymes, but wee affirme, allowe, and vse certaine daies, and tymes appoicted for praier, and godlie exercises. By watches, if you meane your vigiles, of sainctes daies, you your selues vse onely the name, and not the obseruatiō of those watches. Whiche although thei were vsed of olde in the Churche, yet for diuers inconueniences, thei were lefte of, and by decree of the Counsaile Elibertinū
                   abrogated Can. 35.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Thirtene it doeth denie the obseruation of holy and solemne promises, and vowes made vnto God.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               We doe not denie the obseruations of any lawfull promises, made vnto GOD, that are possible to bee kepte of those that make theim. But wee teache menne, not

to bee rashe in makyng promises, before thei bee sure, that thei are able to performe them. And if thei haue made a rash or vnaduised vowe, as to abstaine from Marriage, whiche thei are not able to obserue, but by committyng fornication, and vncleannesse, wee counsaile theim to repente of their rashenesse, and to retourne to the ordinaunce of GOD, whiche is the remeadie of incontinence, rather then to leade an abhominable life, in filthinesse.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Fowertene it dooeth denie the chaste life apertainyng to the order of Priesthode.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               We affirme, that chaste life appertaineth to all menne, and especially to Ecclesiasticall ministers. But we do not compt marriage an vnchaste life, as you doe, but holie, and honourable in all menne, and the marriage bedde to be vndefiled. Hebr. xiij. And seeyng that the holie ghoste by sainct Paule, in his Epistles to Timothe and Titus, describyng the beste qualities required in Bishoppes, and Deacons, allowed marriage, wee dare not presume to

disalowe it, or to forbidde any man from it, leaste wee should teache the doctrine of Deuilles, as you doe.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Fiftene ie doth deny the inuocation, and honour due vnto sainctes.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               Howe shall wee call vppon theim, in whom we dooe not beleue? Roma. x. We beleue onely in God, therefore wee call vpon God onely. We acknowledge no mediatour of God and men, but onely Iesus Christe. j. Timoth. ij. Neither of redemption, nor intercession: For the Apostle in that place speaketh purposely of intercession, saiyng, I besech you therfore brethrē, that praiers, supplications, &amp;c. bée made for all men. And as for honour that should be due to sainctes, we acknowledge none, beyng taught by so many places of Scripture, that al honour, and glorie, belongeth onely to God: who is a ielous GOD, and will not giue his honour to any other. Wherefore as Augustine saieth, honoramus eos charitate, non seruitute, wee honour theim with loue, and not with seruice, by whiche testimonie of that godlie manne,

your blinde distinction of latria, and doulia is ouerthrowen, for what is doulia, but seruitus? Whiche kinde of honour, sainct Augustine, doeth vtterly deny to be giuen to sainctes. August. De vera religione. Capi. 55. The same Augustine dooeth also declare, wherein their honour doeth consist, namely, in followyng of their example. Honorandi sunt propter imitationem, non adorandi propter religionem. Thei are to be honoured for imitations sake, not to bée whorshipped for religions sake. And you your self diffined religion before, to be cultus diuinus, the seruice due vnto GOD, howe would you then that true Religion, should dooe any seruice to menne, or Angelles, whiche are but creatures of God.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Sixtene it dooeth denie oblations and praiers for the soules departed.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               We affirme accordyng to the scripture, that the deade whiche die in the lorde are blessed, for they reste from their labours, and therefore to praie for theim that are happy, were superfluous. And as for those that die not in the lorde, thei are accursed,

and therefore no praier is to bee made for theim: and al that die, doe either die in the lord, or not in the lord, for betwene cōtradictories ther is no meane. Apo. 14. Our sauiour christe testifieth of theim that beleue in God, that sent hym, that thei haue life euerlastyng, and come not into iudgement, but passe from death to life. Iohn. 5. And if any hadde neede to bee pourged for satisfaction (as you teache, that men must be in purgatorie) the holy theef, that was crucified with Christe, shoulde haue béen one especially, but our sauiour christ made him assurance of felicity immediatly, this daie (saieth he) thou shalte bee with me in Paradise. Luke. 23. And séeyng the Scripture neither commaundeth nor commendeth Praier for the deade, it is vntollerable presumptiō for any man, to vse it. And as for oblations, wee finde none in Gods woorde apoincted for the deade, that wee shoulde offer: no not in the oulde lawe, where there was so manie diuerse kindes of Sacrifice, no one was appoincted for the deade. Wherefore the example of Iudas rehearsed by the aucthour of the seconde booke of Machabées is neither to bee allowed,

nor followed, because he hadde no warrant of Gods lawe to offer any suche Sacrifice.
               The seuententh negation was altogether lefte out in the copie which came first to my handes, I suppose by negligence of the writer, but in another copie I finde it thus.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Seuententh it doth denie Images, and the crosse of Christe.
            
            
               The Aunswere.
               Accordyng to the worde of God, and the consente of the primitiue churche, wée denie the vse of Images in the Churche, whiche are the doctrine of vanities and lies, as the Prophet witnesseth Abac. 2.
            
            
               The Papiste,
               Eightene it doeth denie the buriall of the deade bodies in the Churche yeardes.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               Wee are not so carefull for the buriall of our deade bodies, to dispute where they muste bee laied, so that dewe reuerence without superstition be vsed in their Sepulture, nether dooe wee refuse to burie theim in the Churche yerdes and places of

comon buriall, although we thinke no holines to bee more in one place then in an other.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Nintene it doeth denie the hallowyng of the Fonte, Oile, Palmes, and Asshes.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               Of hallowyng the water of baptisme, I haue spoken sufficiently before, as for oile Palmes, Asshes, and suche other beggerly Elementes of the worlde, that haue no woorde of GOD to comende them, wee haue no vse of theim in our religion: but in their Ciuile vse, all the creatures of god are hallowed to vs by the woorde of God and praier. Gal. 4. Coll. 2.1. Tim. 4.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Twentie it doth denie holy breade, holy water, Vestimentes, Chalices, Copes, Tunicles Candlestickes, lightes, Sensors, Orgaines in the church, singing in the quere, reliques of sainctes, pardones and pilgrimages, wherby it doeth appeare, that the religion of this newe reformed Church doth stande wholy of negatiues, by destroiyng, subuertyng, and deniyng of all thinges before vsed in the Catholike Churche of Christe.
            
            
               
               The aunswere.
               As this twentieth differeth from the ninetenth only in wordes, so one answere shall serue bothe. These weake and beggerly Elementes of the worlde, christian religion needeth not, hauyng Christe in whom dwelleth all fulnes and perfection, wisedome, iustificatien, sanctification. And generally, of all Ceremonies as is often saied before, wée admitte none as parte of Gods whorshippe, whiche are instituted of menne: onely suche as bee accidentall, and mutable, if they be ordeined for edificatiō, order, and decencie, and be voide of superstition, we obserue theim. But so that no mannes conscience bee bounde to theim. And that when soeuer occasion serueth for better edification and more comely order, it is lawfull to abrogate them, and to institute newe in their places.

ieste, he made sale of an horse, all by negatiues on this wise, saiyng vnto hym how that his horse had not a great heade, his horse hadde not a paire of Asse eares, his horse had not one touth in his heade longer then an other, his horse had not a sadle backe, no Splent, Spauen, or Ringbone, hys horse was not pincromped, sicle hought, nor broke winded, and so forth all by negatiues, he soulde his horse to Clare the Butcher, not expressyng what his horse hadde, but what his horse had not. Dealyng therin with muche like faieth and truthe, as our Preachers dooe with the people of this Realme, which goe aboute to plante a new religion amongest theim, which standeth as I haue here expressed wholy by negatiues, in affirmyng nothyng, and deniynge all thinges.

               You conclude your matter, as it is verie mete, with a merie tale, I had almoste saied of Robin Hoode, and little Ihon, but I should saie of maister Molande, and Clare the Butcher of Oxforde. Whereby a manne may perceiue, you were pleasauntely disposed, that in so shorte a treatise,

wold néedes thruste in so long a tale, and the same to dilate with all the circumstaunces, whereas you had no leasure to note the places of your Doctours, that ye alledge in good earneste. But now sir, (sauyng your tale) and to applie it to the purpose. If maister Molande, as he rehersed some faultes, of whiche perhappes his horse was free, so he had recited all the faultes, that maie be in any horse, and denied theim all to bee in his horse, might not Clare the Butcher, haue boughte a good horse, of him by negatiues? But maister Molande like a subtile Sophister, repeateth a many of his defaultes, and suppresseth as many, or more, and so he begileth poore Clare the Butcher. And this Sophistrie of maister Molande, is youre Logike throughout all your treatise, of a fewe particulars, to inferre an vniuersal. And this your Iade belike, you thoughte to sell vnto some, as simple as Clare the Butcher, that could no more discerne of your diuinitie, then Clare the Butcher, could sée of maister Molandes Sophistrie. Or els if you mente good faithe, as you do pretende, I must nedes saie, to quitte your

tale, that if Clare wer not a better Butcher, then you shewe your self to be a Logicien, or diuine, you might bothe procede in one facultie, and maister Molande bee your presenter. For as he solde his horse by negatiues, so you haue proued, that all our Religion standeth wholie vppon negatiues, that we denie all thinges, and affirme nothyng.

               Dewe obiections made againste the premisses. For wheras ye haue saiede the religion of this newe reformed Churche, to stande wholy by negatiues, in affirmynge no one thyng more then was before vsed, in the Catholike churche of Christe, howe vntrue this is who seeth not when the religion of this newe reformed Church, doth affirme, and hath brought in many thinges as good, godly, and lawfull, whiche before were straightly denied.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               It must néedes be a clerkely disputatiō, wher you maie be both opponent, &amp; respō
                  dent your self, wher you maie make argumētes for vs, and make answere for your self. But as he that aunswereth, if he gett

the victorie, ouerthroweth him that opposeth: so you taking vpon you to oppose, and aunswere your self, you can ouerthrowe none, other but your owne self. But neuer a one of these fiue obiections, is holden of vs, in maner and forme, as it is propounded of you. And therfore I would desire you henceforwarde, to defende youre owne matters, aswell as you can, for you shall gette neither money, nor thankes, to plaie the Proctor for vs.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Firste it dooeth affirme, that it is lawfull, and bothe good and godly that Priestes shoulde take wiues, and beyng firste made Priestes, it is lawfull to marie.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               We affirme that it is vnlawfull, that any manne should bee bounde to sole life, whiche hath not the gifte of continence. And that marriage is as honourable in ecclesiasticall ministers, as in al other men, whether thei were married before thei were called to that office, or to whether thei marrie afterwarde. Hebre. xiij. j. Timoth. iij. and Tite. j.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               
                  Seconde it dooeth affirme, that Freers Monkes, and Nonnes after their vowes made solemnely vnto God of their chaste and cōtinent life, that it is lawful for theim to mary together, and holde the same to be good and lawfull wedlocke.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               Wee affirme, that who soeuer hath made a rashe, and vnaduised vowe of continence, whiche he is not able to keepe, ought to repente him of his rashenes, and rather to marrie, then to burne. j. Cor. 7.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Thirde it doeth affirme, that a man beyng deuorced from his wise for fornicatiō, may therupon marie againe, and take another, and so it is lawfull for hym to haue twoo wiues a liue, the one in the bedde, the other diuorced.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               Wee affirme that thei, whiche are lawfully deuorced for adulterie, are no more housebande, and wife. For the knot of marriage by lawfull deuorsemente, is cleane dissolued, and therefore a manne so deuorsed, maie marrie, and not haue twoo wiues at ones, accordyng to the doctrine,

and right vnderstandyng of our Sauiour Christes wordes. Math. v. and xix.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Fowerth it doeth affirme Breade ad wine, to bee the whole substaunce of the Eucharistie, after the consecration.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               Wee affirme accordyng to the scriptures, and faithe of the Churche, for a thousande yeres after Christe, that breade and wine remaine in the Sacrament, and are necessarie there to remaine, that it maie bée a Sacramente, for the woorde muste come to the Elemente, and so make it a Sacrament. But we doe not affirme, that breade, and wine is the whole substaunce of the Sacrament, but the bodie and blood of Christe, receiued by faithe, is the principall parte thereof, as in Baptisme the outward Element is water, but the principall part thereof, is the pourgyng of our sinnes, by the secrete, and wōderfull workyng of the holie ghoste.
            
            
               the Papiste.
               Fifte it doth affirme that onely faieth iustifieth, and that faieth alone is sufficient to procure and purchase for vs, gods grace

and mercie, for the time of this present life, and at the ende and terme therof, life euerlastyng. Beside many other like diuerse thinges that the religion of this newe reformed churche doth affirme as thinges lawfull, and haue brought theim into this realme, as thinges good and godly.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               Wee affirme, that the free mercie of God in Christ, is the efficient cause of our iustification, whiche mercie we apprehēde by none other hande, or instrumente, but by faithe. But that either faithe dooeth procure, or purchase Gods grace, or mercie, by any whorthinesse of it, wee vtterly denie, as also that onely faithe is sufficiēte for a christian man: when we teache that this faith, by which we are iustified, is not a solitarie faith, but of necessitie accompanied with many vertues, &amp; good workes, although by receiuyng Goddes mercie, no workes, but onely faithe doeth iustifie vs.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               An answere against the obiections.
               For aunswere beside, that there is no one of their affirmatiōs, now by theim brought that maketh any thing ad cultum diuinum,
                  
to the seruice and honouryng of god, wherin true religion doth consiste, as it is before proued by the diffinition therof, geuen by Augustine al their affirmations doe include some negatiōs of a farre more better thing, then is brought in by their affirmations.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               But euen nowe, in the latter ende of the firste obiection, you confesse, that wee affirme many other thynges, beside these fiue, whiche you haue rehersed. And now as though, we had no other affirmations, you conclude, (as your maner is) that no one of our affirmatiōs, maketh any thyng ad cultum diuinum to gods seruice, and that all our affirmations doe include a negation, of a farre better thing, then is brought in by them. So that when wee affirme all the articles of the Crede, none of theim perteineth to Goddes seruice, but rather include a negation of a farre better thing. When we affirme, that Christe onely is the heade of his vniuersall Churche, wee doe it not to the honour of Christ, but wée include ye negation of a farre better thing, that is the supremacie of the Pope. Whiche by your assertion, is a farre more better

thyng, then the supremacie of Christ. So when we affirme, that onely the scripture must bee the rule of true Religion, it maketh nothyng for Religion, to worshippe God as he hath commaunded, but it includeth a negation of vnwritten verities, whiche are farre more better thinges, then the scripture. When we affirme that we must put our trust in God alone, we doe no honour to God therby: but we denie yt men muste put their trust in creatures, which by your rule, is a farre more better thyng, then to putte our truste in God alone. When wee affirme, that wée must praie to God alone, it perteineth nothyng, to Gods seruice, but includeth the negation, of praiyng vnto sainctes, whiche is a farre more better thyng, then to pray vnto God. And when we affirme, that the onely Sacrifice of Christes passion, is sufficiente for our saluation, we yelde no honour to God thereby, but denie the Sacrifice of the Masse, whiche is a farre better thyng, then the Sacrifice of Christes passiō. And thus if I had leasure, and pleasure, as you haue, to number examples by tennes, and by twenties, I might reherse

a whole hundreth of the like sorte.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               As for example their affirmation that it is lawfull for Priestes to take wiues, is a denial of chaste and continent life of priestes, whiche as the Apostle sainct Paule saieth is muche farre better.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               Wee so affirme marriage of Ecclesiasticall ministers, as an honourable, and a chaste life, neither doe wée denie continēs to those that haue the gifte thereof. And whereas you vouche sainct Paule to warantie. I aunswere, that saincte Paule in no place, dooeth require virginitie of Ecclesiasticall persones, and wheresoeuer he commendeth it, he praiseth it, no more in priestes, then in laie menne. I would all menne were, saieth he, as I am, but euery one hath his proper gifte of God, some of one sorte, and some of an other. j. Cor. vij.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Their affirmation that Freers, Monkes, and Nonnes, maie mary together, is a flatte deniyng of the vowe of chastetie, which by sainct Paules iudgemente is farre better.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               
                  Wée denie not the obseruation of any promises, or vowes, whiche are lawfull for menne to make, and possible for them to performe. Neither doeth saincte Paule at any time commende any suche vowes, or allowe them to bée kepte, but geueth a generall rule, that to auoide fornication, lett euery manne haue his wife, and euery woman her housebande. j. Cor. vij. And if a virgine marrie, she sinneth not: so that if you would vnderstande virgines in that place, for vowed Nonnes, you should manifestely contrary your self, that coumpte it so heinous a matter, for a Nonne to marrie. And as for the widowes, whiche (as I said before) made no vowes to God, but promises to the churche, if you would needes vnderstande theim for Nonnes, Sainct Paule saieth, it is better for them that are vnder three score yere old to marie, and beare children, then to vowe chastitie. j. Timo. v.
            
            
               The Papiste,
               Their affirmatiō that the diuorced man maie againe marie, is a plaine deniall of reconciliacion, whiche ought to bee made againe, betwixt man and wife, the Apostle

saincte Paule geuyng counsell thereof, that the womā beyng departed from her housebande, shoulde remaine vnmaried to bee reconciled againe vnto her housebande.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               Concernyng diuorses, if that whiche wee wishe, might take place, all controuersies should bee cutte of. For we wishe that adulterers, accordyng to the lawe of God, should be punished with death. But if the Ciuile Lawe dooeth faile in that poincte, the nexte remeadie for the innocente partie, is diuorcemente, and after deuorcement, marriage, if he can not liue vnmarried. For our sauiour Christ excepteth the case of fornication, as well for marriage after deuorcemente, as for the diuorcemente it self. Math. xix. And for amendemente of the partie offendant, the Ecclesiasticall sworde of Excommunication, muste bee drawne out: whiche muste continue so longe vpon the offendour, vntill his vnfeigned, and hartie repentance, doe sufficiently appeare to the Congregation. Whiche in that case, maie not refuse to receiue him againe. The partie then so receiued, bothe of god, and the church, and

not beyng able to leade to a continente life, is at libertie, to marrie also in the Lorde. For the firste marriage by the diuorcemente, is as clearely dissolued, as if it had neuer been. And as concernyng the reconciliation sainct Paule speaketh of, he meaneth not betwene them, that are lawfully diuorced. But betwene those that separate them selues, without a sufficiente cause, whiche is onely fornication. Like as our sauiour Christ, when he saith, that who so marrieth her, that is putte awaie, committeth adulterie, vnderstandeth of her that is vnlawfully putte awaie, for any other cause, beside fornication, in all whiche causes (the case of adulterie onely excepted) she continueth still wife to hym that did putte her awaie so that he whiche marrieth her, marrieth an other mannes wife, and so committeth adulterie. But she that is diuorsed for adulterie, is no mannes wife, and therefore he that marrieth her, committeth none adulterie.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               Their affirmation that breade and wine is the whole substance of the holy Eucharistia, is a plaine deniall of Christes very bodie

in the same, whiche is muche farre better, and a thinge of a farre more greater price then breade and wine is. So that by their affirmations thei doe nothing better, but soner appaire and diminishe the preciousnes of euerie thing they medle with all.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               Wée do not so affirme bread, and wine in the Sacrament, that we denie the presence of the bodie, and bloud of Christe, to the faithe of the worthie receiuer. But that grosse, and carnall presence, whiche you dooe faigne to bee receiued, as well of wicked menne, as of Godlie: whiche immagination beyng of fleshe without the spirite, our Sauiour Christe affirmeth, to be altogether vnprofitable. For if you did not separate it from the spirite, it muste nedes giue life to those that receiue it. As Christe hymself affirmeth, whosoeuer eateth his fleshe, and drinketh his blood, hath life euerlastyng. Ihon. vj. Againe you feigned presence, is vnpossible to the nature of his humaine bodie, whiche he hath in al poinctes like to ours, sinne excepted. Heb. ij. and. iiij.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               
                  And by their affirmation that onely saieth doth iustifie, they doe denie all other thinges els, as Baptisme, penaunce, Confirmation, the holy Eucharistia, hope, charity, and generally all kinde of good workes. For all learnyng doeth agree of three kindes of Iustifications to be expressed in holy scripture, whereof the firste iustication is Qua quis ex impio fit iustus, wherby a mā is made of a wicked man, and a member of the Deuill, a good manne, and a verie member of Christe, the whiche iustification is performed in infantes, by the Sacramente of Baptisme. And therfore to ascribe our iustification to onely faieth, is not onely to deny with the Anabaptistes Baptisme of infantes, but also that the Sacrament of Baptisme is needefull, or necessarie for oure health and saluation.
               Seconde iustification is, qua ex homine lapso post baptismum, fit conuersio ad deum, wherby a man beyng fallen into sinne, after Baptisme, doeth retourne backe againe vnto God, the whiche iustification is performed in vs, by the Sacrament of penaunce, and therfore the affirmation of our iustificatiō by onely faieth, is a plaine denial of the Sacramente

of penaunce.
               Thirde iustification is, qua ex iusto redditur quis iustior, wherby a man hath increase of rightousnesse, and of a rightous man before is made more rightous in the sight of God, wherof speaketh sainct Ihon in his Apocalipse, saiyng that he whiche is rightous muste be made more rightous. VVhiche iustification is performed in vs, partely by the Sacramente of Confirmation, partly by the rest of Christes Sacramentes, and chiefly by the Sacramente of the holy Eucharistia, and more generally by al kind of good workes, wherof speaketh the Apostle sainct Paule, Saiyng to the Philippians, doe you worke your owne saluation with feare and tremblyng. And the Apostle saincte Peter in confirmation therof, willeth vs to geue all diligence for to minister, in our faieth vertue, and in vertue knowledge, in knowledge temperaunce, and in temperance patience, in pacience godlines, in godlines brotherly loue, and in brotherly loue charitie, for if these are among you and plenteous, they will make you, that you shall be neither idle, nor vnfructful in the knowledge of our lorde Iesus Christ. But he that

lacketh these thinges is blinde, as saieth the Apostle sainct Peter, and gropeth for the waie with his hande, and hath forgottē that hee was pourged from his oulde sinnes. VVherefore bretheren saieth (the Apostle saincte Peter) geue you more diligence for to make your callyng and your election by your good workes more suer, for if you doe suche thinges you shall not sinne, yea and by this meanes an entring in shall be ministred vnto you abundantly, in the euerlastyng kingdome of our lorde Iesus christe. And by the affirmation of our iustificatiō by faieth alone, they doe denie not onely the Sacrament of Baptisme, of penaunce, of the holie Eucharistia, with the rest of Christes Sacramentes, but more generally they doe denie all kinde of Good woorkes, here commended and tought, both by saincte Peter, and sainct Paule. Saincte Augustine in his booke de fide &amp; operibus, gaue to vs sufficient admonition, how daungerous an errour and heresie it was, to put our whole iustification to faieth onely, and faieth alone, and saieth how vppon the mistakyng of the wordes of sainct Paule of our iustification by faieth, vppon these woordes misconstrued,

                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉

certaine persones denied the merite of good workes, vprising and springyng of faieth, promising to them selues, safetie and securitie of saluatien, by onely faieth and faieth alone, for reformation of the whiche errour Augustine saieth, that the Apostles sainct Iames, sainct Peter, and sainct Ihon did write their Canonicall Epistles, whiche admonition therof geuen by S Augustine, shoulde haue sufficed both learned and Christen men.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               By affirmyng that onely faithe doeth iustifie, we neither denie the Sacramentes to be receiued, nor any good worke to be exercised, as GOD and all the worlde doeth knowe. For ascribyng to faith, that whiche is her peculier office, wee dooe not deny the offices of any other thinges, that belong vnto theim. As if I affirme that onely the eye doeth see, I doe not denie the eare to heare, or the tounge to tast, or the hande to handle, or the foote to goe, but I denie that the eare, or any other member dooeth sée, saue onely the iye. So affirmyng, that onely faithe dooeth iustifie, wee dooe not denie, the Sacramentes

to be seales of Goddes promises, nor good woorkes to be fruites of our iustification, by whiche God is glorified, and our election in vs established, and yet we deny, that the Sacramentes, or good woorkes, or any other thyng in vs, dooeth iustifie, saue onely faithe, that taketh holde of Goddes mercie, by beleuyng Gods promises. As it is written of Abraham, not for hym onely (as saincte Paule testifieth) but for vs also, Abraham beleued God, and it was imputed to him for righteousnesse: so that faithe doeth not iustifie vs by the merite, or worthinesse therof, but by Goddes imputation of righteousnes therevnto. For to be iustified before GOD, is not to bee righteous by any qualitie that is in vs, but to be accoumpted righteous of GOD for Christes sake, hauing our synnes purged by his passion. But whereas you take vpon you, to talke of iustification, and that so substancially, that you wil tell vs what all learnyng agreeth thereof, you declare that youre learnyng, and discretion are bothe a like. For it were enough for you, to speake of all your owne learning, whiche you knowe, and not of all learnyng in

generall, whiche you knowe not. It is not by and by all lernyng, that the Maister of the Sentence, and after hym all the sentenciaries, and whole rable of Papistes also doe holde. There is some learnyng of the olde writers, and there is some learnyng of the newe writers. And the Protestantes I trust, bee not voide of all learnyng. It were sufficiente for you, to challenge truthe, though you did not boaste of all learning. But seyng all learnyng is on your side, as you saie your self, will you giue a poore manne of small learnyng, leaue, to aske you one question, concernyng that diuision, whiche all learnyng dooeth agree of? Is this your diuision, of the worde of iustification? Or of the thing it self, whiche is Iustification. If it be onely of the woorde iustification (sauyng the correction of all learnyng) I finde in scripture three other diuerse kindes of iustification, of whiche neuer a one, can be comprehended in any of your three kindes of iustification. The firste is, in the. Lj. Psalme. Vt iustificeris in sermonibus tuis, &amp; vincas cum iudicaris. That thou maiest bee iustified in thy saiynges, and gette the vpper

hande, when thou art iudged. The seconde, is in the eleuenth chapiter of sainct Matthew. Iustificata est sapientia a filijs suis. Wisedome is iustified of her own childrē. The thirde is. j. Timo. iij. Deus manifestatus est in carne, iustificatus est in spiritu. &amp;c. God was shewed in the fleshe, iustified in the spirite. &amp;c. Loe heare, are three seueral iustifications more, then your learned diuision dooeth conteine. But if you vnderstande your diuision, not of the diuerses acceptions of the worde, but of the thyng it self, I would demaunde by what kinde of iustification, the Publicane was iustified, of whom our sauiour Christe dooeth testifie, that he departed iustified, rather then the Pharisie. Luke. xviij. The firste kinde you saie, is by Baptisme, but he was not baptised, the seconde you make by penaunce, but he receiued no penaunce: and by the thirde kinde, he could not bee iustified, for he came thether a Publicane, and a synner, Therefore all learning hath left out one kinde of Iustification, whiche Christe hymself doeth teache. And that is the onely true iustification, whereof wee meane, when our synnes beyng pardoned

by the free mercie of God in Christe, wée are accoumpted righteous before hym, whiche is confirmed to vs, when wee beleue his promises therof. And this is that iustification, whereof sainct Paule disputeth at large, in the Epistle to the Romaines. By whiche it maie appeare, what a clearkly diuision you haue made, that excludeth the onely true iustification, which is the thing we cōtende of, and is so moste properly called. But now to consider rightly, the partes of your diuision. You saie, the firste kinde of iustification, is when of an vngodlie manne, is made a godly man. Whiche if it were rightly vnderstoode, is the same iustification, that we speake of, when we saie onely faithe dooeth iustifie. But when you restraine it to Baptisme of infauntes, you are farre wide from our vnderstandyng, and from the truthe. For what is Baptisme to vs, more then Circumcisiō was to Abraham? but Abraham was not iustified by Circumsition, as S. Paule proueth at large, therefore neither are we iustified by Baptisme. But Abraham was iustified by faithe, and receiued Circumsition, as a seale of his iustification,

So we beyng iustified by faith, receiue Baptisme, as a seale of our righteousnes, whiche is by faithe. Thus we doe not denie the Sacramente of Baptisme, as you moste shamefully doe slaunder vs, but we shewe the right vse, and profite thereof, out of the scriptures. For when wee haue receiued by faithe, the promises of Gods fauour, and mercie, in whiche our saluation dependeth, we doe not refuse the seales, whiche are the Sacramentes, whiche GOD hath added for confirmation of our faithe. But whereas you restraine this iustification to infauntes, you shewe your ignoraunce in the Scriptures, for he that ex impio fit iustus, that is, of a wicked man is made righteous, muste beleue in hym that iustifieth the vngodlie manne, as it is in saincte Paule. Roma. iiij. and so his faithe is imputed, or accoumpted to hym for righteousnesse, and in suche sorte, that it is without respecte of woorkes, whiche is nothyng els, but that wee affirme, an vngodlie manne is iustified by faithe onely, for what woorkes canne he haue, that should cōcurre with faithe, to iustifie him, whiche is an vngodly manne, before he be

iustified, and therefore Augustine saieth verie well of good woorkes. Sequuntur iustificatum, non praecedunt iustificandum. Thei followe hym that is iustified, thei goe not before hym that is to bee iustified. Seyng therefore, that faithe is necessarie in this iustification, and infauntes (to speake properly) haue no faithe, this iustification can not bee restrained to Baptisme of infantes, which if thei dye before thei heare the worde of God preached, that thei maie beleue, are saued by election, if thei bee the children of God, and not by faithe. For as the doctrine of faithe, perteineth to theim onely, that liue to heare the Gospell preached, to whiche thei maie giue credite, and bryng for the fruictes of good woorkes accordyngly, to the praise of Goddes glorie: So the doctrine of Iustification, by faithe onely, pertaineth to theim, and not to infantes. And therefore your assertion, that infantes are iustified by Baptisme, commeth nearer to the errour of the Anabaptistes, for bothe you, and thei require faith necessarie, to bee in all them that shall bee Baptised, wherevpon springeth twoo heresies, the one of the Anabaptistes, deniyng

the Baptisme of infātes, because thei haue no faithe: the other of the Papistes, fantasiyng that thei haue faithe, and therfore are iustified by Baptisme. Whereas the saiyng of our sauiour Christe, whiche is misunderstoode of you bothe (he that beleueth, and is baptised, shalbe saued) must with all equitie, be expounded, accordyng to the matter whereof he speaketh, accordyng to the wordes goyng before. Which are, Goe into all the worlde, and preache the Gospell to euery creature. Mat. xxviij. Mark. xvj. So that where preachyng hath gone before, their faithe is necessarie to saluatiō, and necessarie to be required, before a manne bee Baptised. For we must remember, that our sauiour Christ, doeth not in that place, institute Baptisme, but shewe how it must bee added, as a seale of the Gospell, for confirmation of the beleuers, and for a testimonie of their profession. But seyng that God hath also a secret operation in Baptisme, whereby the children of GOD are regenerate, by his holy spirite, and that the fauour of God, extendeth by his promise, not only to our selfes, but also to the seede of vs that are faithefull,

we minister the Sacrament of Baptisme, to our infantes also, because thei are comprehended within the compasse of Gods couenaunte, and therefore ought to haue the seale, and cognisaunce of Goddes couenaunte sette vpon them. And yet not bindyng the grace of GOD so straightly, to the outwarde Elemente, but that, he maie saue the children of the faithfull, without Baptisme, whom he taketh out of this life, before thei can receiue this sacramente in the churche, accordyng to his holie institution.
               And this iustification by faithe onely, we doe not make to be an inconstant qualitie of righteousnes, that should be within vs, whiche is abolished so often as wee fall into synne, but a perpetuall acceptation of God, wherby he imputeth not our synnes vnto vs, but accoumpteth vs righteous, for the righteousnes of Christe, accordyng as sainct Paule difineth iustification by faithe, without workes, out of the xxxj. Psalme. Blessed are thei whose iniquities are forgiuen, and whose synnes are couered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lorde dooeth not impute his synne.

Roma. iiij. For whom God dooeth iustifie by faithe, he dooeth not iustifie them for a daie, or a yere, but for euer, as S. Paule testifieth, whom he hath iustified, he hath glorified. Roma. viij. Whereby it is easie to see, what a vaine iustification that is, whiche you make to be your second kinde by penaunce, whiche is loste, by euery fall into deadly synne, of whiche kinde of iustification, the scripture speaketh not one woorde, but it is a fantasie of youre owne braine, to sette vp a Butcherie of mennes consciences, and to make your selues Lordes, ouer their consciences, by binding thē vpon necessitie of saluation, to your beggerly Penaunce. For although a manne that is regenerate, and iustified of God, is not onely subiecte to infinite falles, as the scripture testifieth (the righteous manne falleth seuen tymes a daie, and riseth againe) but also sometymes falleth into greate, and notable crimes, as Dauid into murther, and adulterie, yet can he neuer fall from the fauour of God, but that he is called to repentaunce, and his synnes are forgiuen hym. For this foundation shall neuer faile, the Lorde knoweth who are

his, and whom soeuer he hath knowen before all tyme, theim he will call in tyme thought conuenient to his wisedome, and theim whō he hath so called, he hath iustified, and whom soeuer he hath iustified, he will glorifie eternally. Roma. viij. And in this iustification, whereby God receiueth vs into his fauour, and pardonyng our sinnes, imputeth rightousnes vnto vs, there is no degrees, for whē he doeth iustifie vs, he maketh vs his children, and so his children, that wee are his heires, and heires by adoption, annexed with Christe his onely begotten soonne by nature. Roma. viij. Wherefore althoughe faithe, and good woorkes, the one beyng the instrument to receiue, the other beyng the fruites to shewe our iustificatiō, maie, &amp; ought to increase daiely in vs, that are iustified: Yet our iustification before GOD, is not thereby increased, who imputeth righteousnesse vnto vs, for Christes sake alone, and not for our owne worthines. Wherby it is euidente, how vnlike youre thirde kinde of iustification, is to the iustification of God, who iustifieth not the righteous, but the vngodlie manne, that beleueth in

hym. And as for the testimonie that you alledge, out of the Apocalipse, although it maie haue a true meanyng, that he which is iuste, maie bee made more iuste, and he that is holie, maie bee made more holie, whiche is of the increase of vertues, and not of iustification: yet the beste interpretation, accordyng to the Greke phrase, is rather of continuance, then increase, and so it is beste translated, he that is righteous, lette hym be righteous still, and he that is holie, let hym be holie still. Wherfore, you se vpō how weake a foundation, youre thirde kinde of iustification dooeth leane, namely vpon a corrupte translation. But admitte it bee so, as you dooe take it, there is greate difference betwene a iuste manne, and a manne iustified. For a iuste manne, is he, that is indued with the vertue of iustice, whiche maie increase, or diminishe in hym: But a iustified manne is he, whose synnes are forgiuen hym, and he accoumpted rightous, not for his owne worthinesse, but for Christes sake, therefore, although the vertue of iustice, which is a qualitie in hym, may increase, yet, because in Goddes sight, there is no respecte

of his worthines, his iustification can not increase therby. For what can he be more then the soonne of GOD, and inheritour with Christ, of the kyngdome of heauen. If you saie, he maie haue greater reward, that hath greater vertues, I will not contende againste you, so that this bee remē
                  bred, that his vertues are rewarded, not as his merites; but as Gods giftes, for his promise sake. So that a iuste, or righteous man, is he that exerciseth hymself, in the kepyng of Goddes commaundementes, so neare as God shall giue hym grace, and the infirmitie of mannes corrupt nature, will admitte. But a iustified manne, is he that hauyng no iustice, or righteousnesse in hym before, is accepted of God for iust, his iniquities being pardoned, and his sinnes couered. And for them that be simple, an example will make the matter plaine. There are twoo menne standyng before a prince, the one that hath not transgressed the princes lawes, whiche maie be called a iuste manne: The other that hath greuously offended, and is pardoned of the prince, whiche maie well bee termed a iustified manne. But this difference there

is to be noted, in this example, that before God, none can bee iuste, or righteous, but he that is firste iustified, neither can any manne be so iuste, but that he offendeth in many thynges, and hath neede of greate mercie. Thus it is cleare, how impertinē
                  tly the increase of faithe, and good woorkes, with tertes of Scripture belongyng thereto are of you drawne to iustification before God. Wherefore by our affirmation, that onely faithe iustifieth, we neither denie the exercise, and commoditie of christes Sacramentes, nor yet the studie, and practise of all good woorkes, commaunded of God, but rather established them: when we teache, that the Sacramentes are seales, and confirmation of this faithe, and good workes, are the fruites of the same: firste to the glorie of God: secondly for the example af others: and thirdly, for assuraunce of our election to vs warde, and increase of our rewarde before God. And as for that, whiche you alledge out of saincte Augustine, whiche of all other writers, is moste cleare of our iudgemente, for election, iustification, and sainctification, maketh nothyng in the worlde againste vs.

For wee dooe not teache (as I haue often saied) that a bare faithe alone, whiche is voide of good woorkes, is sufficiente for our saluation, but that a true, liuely, and fruitefull faithe, onely dooeth iustifie vs before God, that GOD maie haue all the glory, of our saluation in Christ: And that sanctification, or good woorkes, of necessitie must followe a iustified man, whereby God maie bee glorified, his neighbour profited, and himself rewarded, not of merite due to his woorkes, but of mercie, accordyng to Goddes promise.
               And that whiche sainct Iames speaketh of faieth, that it dooeth not iustifie, alone, he meaneth, as he himselfe expoundeth, of a deade faithe, whiche is voide of good woorkes, of an historicall faith, that there is one God. &amp;c. whiche the diuell beleueth, not of a liuely faithe, whiche worketh by charitie, nor of a iustifiyng faithe, whiche embraceth the mercie of God set forthe in his promises. So that this saiyng of sainct Iames, a man is not iustified by faithe onlie, is all one with this, a deade faith or an historicall faieth doth not iustifie, whiche we doe alwaies affirme. And whereas he

speaketh of iustification by woorkes, hee meaneth of argumentes proues, and certeine signes to the worlde, of iustification before God, as it is manifest by his examples. For Abraham was iustified before God by faith, without respect of his workes, as sainct Paule doth testifie, when he beleued the promise, and that the scripture saied his faithe was imputed to hym for rightousnes, whiche was long before he offered his soonne Isaake: but this his obedience, was a triall and manifest testimonie, of his iustification by faithe, to all the worlde, whereuppon as saincte Iames concludeth, it was euident to al men, how this scripture was fulfilled: Abraham beleued God, and it was imputed to hym for righteousnes. Likewise the harlot Rahab, as witnesseth the Apostle to the Hebrues the. 11. was iustified by faith, when she beleued the worde of God, concernyng the destruction of her Countrie, and all them that did not ioigne theimselues to the people of god: but she shewed the fruict of this faith, when she enterteined and dismissed the spies, that came to her house. So that by this distinction, of faithe and iustification,

sainct Iames agréeth with S. Paule, whiche without it, can neuer by reconciled. For that confusion of faithe and workes, which the papistes make to concurre in iustification, can neuer make theim agree, for sainct Paule doth flattly exclude workes from that office. Wee determine saieth he, that a man is iustified by faithe without the workes of the lawe. Rom. 3. But this is the iudgement of both the Apostles, that a liuely faithe alone doth iustifie. The one affirmeth, that nothing is required to iustifie but faithe, the other affirmeth, that faithe whiche onely is required as sufficient to iustification, is not deade, solitary or vnfruictfull, but liuely, fruictfull, &amp; accompanied with manie vertues, &amp; good workes. For he that acknowledgeth his sinnes to be forgeuen of God for Christes sake, and that he is receiued of God as his childe (whiche is to be iustified) must needes loue God, and all theym that loue God, muste néedes haue a desier to obeye God, honour God, to be thanckefull to God, and to profette all theim, that God hath commaunded hym to loue. And this is the worste effecte of onely faithe

iustifiyng. But because you make it so straunge a matter, as though it had neuer been heard of in the worlde before nowe, that faithe alone or onely faithe doth iustifie, I will rehearse you the sentences of a fewe doctours, that I haue readde, whiche in plaine wordes affirmed the same, many hundred yeres before you and I were borne. Not doubtyng but they, that haue redde more then I, are able to bring forth a greate deale more then I haue brought.
               
                  Origines, though otherwise a verie vnpure writer, yet for iustification by faithe onely, speaketh very plainly, although not in all poinctes truely, vpon the Epistle to the Rom. lib. 3. Cap. 3. Dicit sufficere solius fidei iustificationem, ita vt credens quis tantummodo, iustificetur etiamsi operis nihil ab eo fuerit expletū. Imminet igitur nobis qui integram esse scripturam Apostoli conamur asserere, &amp; ordine suo cuncta constare, vt requiramus, quis sine operibus, sola fide iustificatus sit. Quantum igitur ad exemplum pertinet. &amp;c. S. Paule saieth that the iustification of faith alone, doth suffice, so that he whiche beleueth onlie, maie bee iustified, although he haue doen no good worke. Wherefore it standeth

vs vppon, that take in hande to defende the writyng of the Apostle, to bee perfecte and all thinges therein to stande with good order, to enquire who was iustified by faithe onely without woorkes. Therefore for examples sake, I thinke that theife is sufficiente, whiche beeyng crucified with Christe, cried to hym from the Crosse. Lord Iesu remember me whē thou comest into thy kyngdome. Neither is there any other good woorkes of his described in the Gospell, but for this faieth onely, Iesus saide to hym, verily I saie to thee, this daie thou shalte bee with me in Paradice. Thus far Origine. Neuertheles wee muste remember, as I haue saide before, that although this thief was iustified by faithe onely, yet this faithe was fructefull of suche good workes, as the tyme suffered hym to expresse, as inuocation, repentaunce, reprehension of his fellowe. &amp;c. The same Origene saieth. Idem enim ipse deus, ex vtro
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      populo non circumcisionis, aut praeputij priuilegio, sed solius fidei contemplatione iustificat. The same God out of bothe the people, not by priuilege of Circumcisiō, or vncircumcision, but by the contemplation

of faith alone, dothe iustifie. And in the. 4. booke and. 4. Cap. Initium iustificandi à deo fides est qua credit in iustificantem, &amp; haec fides cum iustificata fuerit, tanquam radix imbre suscepto haeret in animae solo. &amp;c. Faithe is the beginnyng of iustifiyng before god, which beleueth in hym that iustifieth, and this faithe after it is iustified, as a roote that is wattered with a showre of raine, abydeth faste in the grounde of the soule, that when it beginneth to bee dressed and delued by the lawe of God, the boughes arise in it, whiche bring forthe the fruicte of good workes. And in diuers other places Origē, sheweth himself to be of the same minde. Sainct Cypriane ad Quirinum. Cap. 4. In nullo gloriādum quando nostrum nihil sit. We haue to bost of nothing, seyng nothing is our owne. Where bee then our merites? Againe. Cap. 42. Fidem tantum prodesse, &amp; tantum nos posse, quantum credimus. He affirmeth that faithe onely doth profitte, and that so muche as we beleue, so muche we maie obtaine. Wherein he agreeth with our sauiour Christe saiyng, all thinges are possible to hym that beleueth. Also in his booke de duplici Martyrio, he writeth thus.

                  Non credit in deum, qui non in eo solo collocat totius foelicitatis suae fiduciam. He doothe not beleue in God whiche dooeth not place in him alone the assurance of all his felicitie. In whom then doe Papistes beleue, that truste in their owne merites and in creatures? Sainct Hilarie agreeth in the same sentence de Trinitate. lib. 2. Et cum sola fide expleri quae praecepta sunt oporteret. &amp;c. Seing that these thinges whiche are commaunded, must be accomplished by faithe onely, that is to worshippe the father, and with hym to honour the soonne, and to abounde in the holy ghoste, wee are inforced to extende the basenes of our speache, to those thinges that are vnspeakable. Also wrytyng vppon Mathewe Canone. 21. he hath these wordes Nam inuiti licet confitētur quis obsecutus sit voluntati iunior scilicet, filius obediens professione licet non efficiens in tempore. Quia fides sola iustificat, at
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      ideo publicani &amp; meretrices in regno coelorum erunt priores, quia Ioanni crediderūt. For thei confesse though it be againste their will, who hath obeied the fathers wil: namely the yonger, sonne obedient in profession, although not performing in time. Because faith alone doth

iustifie, and therefore the Publicanes and harlattes shalbe sooner in the kingdome of heauen, because they beleued Ihon. &amp;c. And in the. 8. Canon hee hath this plaine conclusion. Fides sola iustificat, faithe alone doth iustifie. Therefore wée are not alone that teache so. Gregorius Nazianzenus in his Oration. 22. de modestia in disceptationibus. Prope te ait verbum est, thesaurum hunc intellectus habet, &amp; lingua, hic quidem credens, illa vero cōfitens, quid his opibus succinctius, quid dono hoc facilius? Confitere christum, &amp; credas eum à mortuis suscitatum esse, ac saluaberis: siquidem &amp; credere solum iustitia est, salus autem perfecta confiteri, loquendi
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      libertatem addere scientiae. The worde saieth he, is neare vnto thée, and this treasure thine vnderstandyng, and thy tongue hath, the one beleuyng, the other confessing, what can bee more shorte, then these riches? what more easie then this gifte? Confesse Christ and beleue that hee is raised from death, and thou shalte be saued. For to beleue onely is rightousnes, and perfecte saluation to confesse and to adde fréedom of speache to knowledge. The same Gregorius carmine de rebus suis, speaking in the person of the publicane

that praied with the Pharisie. Nō opera me saluabunt, tua autem gratia, tuaeqús misericordia, mihi stillet profano, quam solam miseris rex praebuisti spem peccatoribus. Woorkes shall not saue me, but lette thy grace and thy mercie droppe vppon mée profane man, which onely hope, O Kyng thou hast geuen to miserable sinners. From hym dissenteth not Basilius Magnus de humilitate hom. 51. Haec enim est perfecta, ac integra gloriatio in deo, quando neque ob iusticiam suam quis se iactat, sed nouit quidem seipsum verae iusticiae indigum esse, sola autem fide in Christum iustificatum esse. This is a perfecte and full reioysyng in GOD, when a manne doeth not boast hymselfe of his owne rightousnes, but knoweth hymselfe to be voide of true rightousnes, and to bee iustified by faithe onely in Christ. The Papistes now adaies saieth it is greate pryde and presumption whiche Basile acknowledgeth to be true humilitie.
               Saincte Ambrose in many places, sheweth hymself to bée of the same minde, as in his exhortation Ad virgines, speaking of the dowrie, that Christ requireth of vs, to ioigne with hym in marriage: Sola est fides

vtri
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      indiscreta sexui, census virorum dos virginum. It is faithe onely, whiche is indifferente to bothe sexes, the substance of men the dowrie of virgines. Also in the same worke. Nam vnde mihi tantum meriti est cui indulgentia pro corona est? For whēce should I haue so greate merite, when mercie is my croune. And againe, Non ex operibus sed ex fide vnusquis
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      iustificatur à domino. Not by workes, but by faith is euery one iustified of the lorde. And in his Epistle. 82. Ad Vercellenses: Sola vos comitabitur fides. Erit sanè etiā iustitia comes si fides praeuia sit. Onely faithe shall beare you compaignie. And righteousnes also shalbe your companion, if faithe goeth before. Also in Lucam lib. 2. Capit. 2. Nihil in hoc censu verearis terribile, nihil immite, nihil triste, sola vnumquem
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      fides signat. Feare nothyng in this taxyng, that should bee terrible, nothyng cruell, nothyng sadde, or heauie: onely faithe doeth marke euery manne? But these places, you will saie, are somewhat darcke: You shall haue therefore, them that are plaine enough. Vpon the Epistle to the Romaines. Chapit. iij. vpon these wordes. Iustificati gratis per gratiam ipsius, that is, Beyng

iustified freely by his fauoure, he writeth thus: Iustificati sunt gratis, quia nihil operantes, ne
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      vicem reddentes, sola fide iustificati sunt dono dei. Thei are iustified freely, because without any woorkyng, or requitynge, thei are iustified by faithe alone, by the gifte of God. And vpon the iiij. Chapiter Quomodo ergo Iudaei per opera legis iustificari, se putant, iustificatione Abrahae, cum videant Abraham non ex operibus legis sed sola fide iustificatum? Non ergo opus est lex, quando impius per solam fidem iustificatur apud deum secundum propositum gratiae dei. Sic decretum dicit à deo vt cessante lege solā fidem gratia dei posceret ad salutem. That is. How dooe the Iewes thinke, that thei maie bee iustified through the woorkes of the lawe, by the iustification of Abraham, when thei see that Abraham, was not iustified by the woorkes of the lawe, but by faithe alone? Therefore the lawe is not necessarie, seeyng the vngodly manne, is iustified before GOD, by faithe onely, accordyng to the purpose of the grace of God: for so he saith it is decreed of God, that the lawe ceasyng the grace of God requireth faithe alone to saluation.
               
                  And in the same Chapiter, Beatos dicit, de quibꝰ hoc sanxit deus vt sine labore et aliqua obseruatione, sola fide iustificentur apud deum. He saieth thei are blessed, of whom GOD hath decreed this thyng, that without labour, and any obseruation, thei should bee iustified before God, by faithe alone. And againe: Manifeste beati sunt, quibus sine labore, vel opere aliquo, remittuntur iniquitates, &amp; peccata teguntur. Nulla ab his requisita poenitentiae opera, nisi tantum vt credent: It is manifeste, that thei are happie, to whō their iniquities are forgiuen, and their synnes hidde, without any laboure, or woorke of theirs, and no workes of repentaunce, required of them, but onely that thei should beleue.
               And in the. 10. chapiter. Nullum opus dicit legis, sed solam fidem dandam in causa Christi. He saieth, that no woorke of the lawe, but onely faithe muste bee giuen in the cause of Christe. And in the eleuenth chapiter. Et quoniam versutia aduersarij cumulari peccata coeperunt, vt per interdictum magis reus homo constitueretur: deus clementia bonita tis suae semper, homini procurans, vt &amp; quod sine lege erat peccatum, &amp; in lege non possit deleri,

hoc decreuit, vt solam fidem poneret, per quam omnia peccata abolerentur, vt quia nulla spes per legem omnibus hominibus erat, dei misericordia saluarentur. And because through the subtiltie of the aduersarie, synnes beganne to bee increased, so that through the forbiddyng, a manne was made more giltie, God prouidyng alwaie for manne, by the mercie of his goodnes, so that, that whiche was synne without the lawe, and by the lawe could not bee putte awaie, he decreed this, to prepare onely faithe, by whiche all synnes should be taken awaie, that because there was no hope to all men by the lawe, thei might bee saued by the mercie of God. And vpon the j. Cor. Cha. j. Datam dicit gratiā, à deo in Christo Iesu, quia gratia sie data est in Christo Iesu, quia hoc constitutum est à deo, vt qui credit in Christum saluus sit sine opere, solae fide gratis accipiens remissionem peccatorum. He saieth, that grace is giuen from God, in Iesus Christe, because grace is so giuen in Christe Iesus, for that it is so appoincted of God, that he whiche beleueth in Christe, shall bee saued without workes, receiuyng forgiuenesse of his synnes freely, by faithe alone.
               
                  And vpon the ij. Cor. Chap. iij. speaking of the lawe of the Gospell. Haec lex dat libertatem solam fidem poscens. This lawe giueth libertie, requiryng faithe alone.
               And in the Preface before the Epistle to the Galathians. Si ergo haec dicta intelligerent, à lege recederent, scientes à praedicatione Ioannis Baptistae, legem iam cessare, vt sola fides sufficiat ad salutem abbreuiata ex lege. If therefore thei did vnderstande these saiynges, thei would depart from the lawe, knowyng that since the preachyng of Ihō the Baptiste, the lawe is now ceased, and faithe alone sufficeth, whiche is an abbridgemente of the lawe. Also vpon the third Chapiter of the Epistle to the Galathiās Sed aliud aduersum improuida praesumptione defendunt, putantes iustificationem sine operibus legis prouenire non posse, cum sciant Abraham qui forma eius rei est, sine operibus legis per solam fidem iustificatum. But thei maintaine an other contrary thyng, by vnskilfull presumption, thinkyng that iustification, can not bee obteined without the workes of the lawe, whereas thei knowe that Abraham, whiche is the example of that matter, was iustified by faithe onely

without the woorkes of the lawe.
               And againe. Manifestatis enim peccatis suis conclusi sunt vt se excusare non possent, sed quaererēt misericordiam vt veniens qui promissus erat Abrahae, solam fidem ab eis posceret, quam habuit Abraham. For when their synnes were made open, thei were concluded, so that thei could not excuse theim selues, but were faine to seeke mercie, that when he came, whiche was promised to Abraham, he might require onely faith of theim, whiche Abraham had. And vpon the v. Chapiter. At
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      per hoc ne
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      praeputium valet quiquam neque Circumcisio. Sed sola fides opus est in charitate ad iustificationem. And by this, neither Circumcision, nor vncircumcision is worthe any thing, but onely faith in loue, is necessarie to iustification.
               Chrysostome also, although he dooe often saie, that faithe alone is not sufficient to saluation, he meaneth it of a deade, and an historicall faithe, whiche is not fruictefull of good workes, as sainct Iames doth: But that he acknowledgeth a true, and liuely faithe, to iustifie alone, maie sufficiently appeare by these testimonies. First vpon Math. Chapiter. j. Hom. i. Non enim

laboribus nostris, ne
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      sudoribus, non doloribus &amp; arumnis, sed per dei in nos tantūmodo charitutem, tā grādia haec promissa suscepimus. Not by our labours, nor our trauailes, not by our sorowes, and griefes, but onely by the loue of God toward vs, we haue receiued these greate promises. And in the twelue Homelie. I am non visibili specie qua vti
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      non egemus, cum nobis pro cunctis sola fides sufficiat. We haue not nede now of outward shew when onely faithe sufficeth vs for al thinges. And vpon the Actes Home. xxx. Vide quomodo vbi
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      omnia tribuunt deo. Hos &amp; nos imitemur. Nihil nostrum esse putemus, quandoquidem &amp; ipsa fides non est nostrum opus. See how thei ascribe all thynges, euery where to god. Lette vs then followe theim, lette vs thinke nothyng is our own, seyng that faithe it self is not our woorke. And again Home. xxxij. A sola fide (inquit) illa assecutisunt, &amp; non operibus, vel circumcisione. Thei obteined (saieth he) those thinges by faith alone, not by workes, or Circumcision. Againe De prodit. Iud. Speakyng of the penitente Thiefe, whether he had any good woorkes, or were Baptised. Ne
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      enim de hoc contenderim ego, sed illud vmim asseuerauerim,

quod sola fides per se saluū fecerit. Of that matter I will not contende, but this one thyng I will affirme, that onely faithe by it self, made hym to bee saued. Also vppon the Episto. ad Roma. Home. ij. Speakyng of righteousnesse. Non enim sudoribus, &amp; laboribus, illam comparabis, sed ex diuino gratiae don
                        •
                      quod ex supernis est gratis vt accipias oportet. Vnum hoc solum adferens de tuo, vt credas. Thou shalt not obtaine it by labours, and trauailes, but thou must receiue it freely, by the gifte of Gods grace, whiche is from aboue, bryngyng this one thyng onely of thyne, that thou beleue. Againe, Hom. vij. Hîc virtutem dei ostendit, quod non solum saluauit, sed &amp; iustificauit, &amp; in gloriationem induxit, nullis ad hoc vsus operibus, sed fidem tantum exigens. Heare he sheweth the power of God, that he hath not onely saued vs, but also iustified, and brought vs into a reioysyng, vsyng here to, none of our woorkes, but requiryng faithe onely. And againe. Quam primum homo credidit confestim iustificatus est. So sone as a manne hath beleued, immediately he is iustified. And Hom. viij. Ne enim quis dicat quid vetat quominus, &amp; fidem habeam, &amp; legem interim seruem,

ostendit fieri non posse. Fidei siquidem virtutem de honeflat, quisquis legem vt velut saluantem seruat. And least any manne should saie, what letteth, but that I maie haue faith, and kepe the lawe also? He sheweth it can not be, for he dishonoureth the vertue of faithe, who so keepeth the lawe, as able to saue hym.
               And in the 9. Hom. Nos solam fidem attulimus, we haue brought faithe alone. And in the same Homelie Apostolus cum dicit spes non confundit, non recte factis nostris, sed dilectioni dei rem omnem acceptam fert. When the Apostle saith, hope doth not confound, he ascribeth the whole matter, not to our good deedes, but to the lawe of God. And in the. 14, Hom. Vnum enim hoc tantummodo donum dei obtulimus, quod futura nobis promittenti credimus, at que hac sola viae saluati sumus. This onely gifte we haue offered to God, that when hee promiseth vs thinges to come, wee beleue hym, and by this onelie waie we are saued. Also vpon the Epistle ad Galath. Cap. 2. Scientes quod non iustificabitur homo ex operibus legis, sed tantum per fidem Iesu Christi, knowing that a man shall not be iustified by the workes of the lawe, but

onely by saieth of Ieseus Christe. And vppon Cap. 3. Tum enim valet fides, cum nihil accesserit exlege. Then faieth is of force, whē nothing of the lawe is added to it. Also speakyng of Abraham. Quod si is ante gratiam ex fide iustificatus est, id
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      cum &amp; operibus bonis floreret, multo magis nos. Quid igitur illi detrimenti attulit, quod nō esset sub legee? nihil, sed sufficiebat ei fides ad iusticiā. If he before the time of grace, were iustified by faithe, and that whē he florished in good workes, muche more we. What hurte was it then to hym, that he was not vnder the lawe? none at all. But his faithe was sufficiente to hym for righteousnes. Again. Rursum illi dicebant qui sola fide nititur execrabilis est, hic contra demonstrat, qui sola fide nititur, eum benedictum esse. They saide, hee that trusteth vnto faith alone is accursed, but he saieth, contrariwise, he that trusteth vnto faithe alone, is blessed. Quū enim lex esset infirmior quam vt posset hominem ad iusticiam perducere, repertum est non leue remedium, nempe fides, quae quod legi erat impossibile, per se redderet poffibile. For whē the law was of lesse force, then that it was able to bring a manne to righteousnes: a remedie of no small fores

was founde out, namely faieth, whiche by herselfe, shoulde make that possible, which was impossible to the lawe. Also vpon the Epi. ad Ephes. Hom. 5. Ex sola quippe fide nos saluauit. For he saued vs by faithe alone. And vpon the Ep. ad Colloss. Hom. 5. Apparet quidem &amp; in reliquis magna mysterij huius gloria, verū multo magis in istis. Hoēs enim lapidibus stupidiores ad angelorū subito dignitatem simpliciter nudis verbis, sola
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      fide fine omni operum adminiculo euehere reuera gloria est, ac misterij huius diuitiae. The greate glorie of this misterie truely appeareth in the rest, but muche more in these. For to aduance men that are more doltishe then stones, sodenly to the dignitie of Angelles, simplie with bare woords, and faith alone, with out all helpe of workes, is glorie in deede, and the riches of this misterie. And in the 6. Hom. Per fidem operationis dei qui exitauit eum ex mortuis. Benedixit, totum enim fidei est. Credidistis deum exitare posse, atque ita exitati estis. By faith of the operation of God, which raised him from the deade. He hath saied well. For it is all of faithe. You haue beleued that God can raise you, and so you are raised. Againe, In decretis (inquit) quibus

decretis fide: satis est credere, non operibus opera, sed fidei adiunxit opera. In the decrées (he saieth) whiche decrees? In faithe for it is sufficiet to beleue, he ioygneth not works to workes, but workes to faithe. Also vppon. 2. Thess. Hom. 4. Quo modo in salutē? vt sanctificaret nos per spiritum. Ab istis namque salutis nostrae summa dependet, nusquam ab operibus, nusquam à recte factis, sed per fidem veritatis Howe vnto saluation? that he might sanctifie vs by his spirit. For herof dependeth the sume of our saluation, not at al of woorkes, not at all of good deedes, but by faithe, or belefe of the truth. Also vpō the 1. Tim. Hom. 3. Id solum inquit attulimus nos quia credidimus christū nos posse saluare. This onely saith he haue wee brought, namely, that we haue beleued, that christ is able to saue vs. And in the. 4. Hom. Quid igitur est? ita cui difficilis habebatur fides, quod inimici, quod peccatores, quod hi qui in lege non iustificantur, neque per opera, hi continuo ex fide sola primas partes meritorum consecuti sunt. &amp;c. what is it ihen? so that to whom faiethe seemed a harde matter, because that enimies, because that sinners, because that they whiche colde not bee iustified by the

lawe, nor yet by workes, these immediatly by faithe, alone obtained the chief worthines. And in the same place. Incredibile enim videbatur, siquidem homo qui omnem priorem vitam frustra, atque inaniter consumpsisset, duxisset
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      per mala opera, post modum ex fide sola saluandus diceretur. For it séemed an incredible thing, that a manne, whiche had spent all his former life vainely and to no purpose, but passed it awaie in euill workes, shoulde afterwarde be saide to be saued by faith alone. Also the Epistle to Titus. Hom. 3. Si enim credis fidei, cur alia infers quasi fides iustificare non sufficiat sola. If thou truste vnto faithe., why bryngeste thou in other thinges? as though faieth alone were not sufficient to iustifie. Likewise vppon the Epistle to the Hebrues Cap. 4. Hom. 7. Accedamus cū fiducia petentes. Tantum fidem adferamus, &amp; omnia tribuet. Lette vs approache neare with confidence makyng our petition, let vs bring foorth faith onely, and he geueth all thinges. These testimonies dooth aboundauntly declare, what Chrisostome thought of iustificatiō by faith alone. Let vs now sée what sainct Ierome wil saie to the same matter. First

therfore against the Pelagians. lib. 1. Hee writeth thus. Ergo iusti sumus quando nos peccatores fatemur, &amp; iustitia nostra nō ex proprio merito, sed ex dei consistit misericordia. Then are we rightous, when we confesse our selues to bee sinners, &amp; our vnrighteousnes consisteth not of our owne merite, but of the mercie of god. And in the. 2. boke of the same worke. Manifestè ostendit non in hominis merito, sed in dei gratia esse iusticiā, qui sine legis operibus credentium suscipit fidem. He sheweth manifestly, that rightousnes is not in the merite of a manne, but in the grace of God, whiche receiueth the faieth of beleuers without the woorkes of the lawe. Also in his Commentarie vppon Marke Chap. 14. Gratia non meritis saluati sumus à deo: we are saued of God by grace, and not by merites. And oftentymes els where he speaketh to the same effecte, but especially in the Commentarie vpon the Epistle to the Romaines, whiche beareth his name. Cap. 4. Conuertentem impium per solam fidem iustificat deus, non opera bona quae non habuit. God iustifieth the vngodly man when he conuerteth by faith alone, not by good workes whiche he had not. And Cap.

10. Ignorantes quod deus ex sola fide iustificat, &amp; iustos se ex legis operibus, quā nō custodiebant putantes. &amp;c. Not knowyng that God doth iustifie by faithe alone, and thinking them selues iuste by the woorkes of the lawe whiche they did not kepe: Againe. Talis est ille qui Christum credidit die qua credidit, qualis ille qui vniuersam legem impleuit. He that beleueth in christ, is such a one ye first daie in which he beleueth, as he is, yt hath fulfilled all the lawe. And againe Moyses distinxit in leuitico inter vtram
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      iusticiam, fidei scilicet atque factorum, quod altera operibus, alterae sola fidei credulitate accedente fiat. Moses in Leuiticus made distinction of both kindes of righteousnes, namely of faith &amp; of déedes, that the one is brought to passe by workes, the other by onely beliefe of faith commyng vnto it: yet againe in the same Chapiter. Ergo si fides sufficit ad iusticiam, &amp; confessio ad salutem, inter Iudeum &amp; Gentiles credētes, nulla est discretio. Therfore if faith suffice to righteousnes, and cōfession to saluation, there is no difference betwene the Iewe and the Gentile that are beleuers. And vpon the Epistle ad Gal. Cap. 1. Gratia vobis qua sola estis fide saluati. Grace to you

by whiche alone through faithe you are saued. And Cap. 2 Non ex operibus legis, sed sola fide sicut Gentes, vitam in Christo inuenisse te nosti: He maketh Paule speakynge to Peter saiynge: Thou knowest that thou thy selfe, haste founde life in Christe, not by the woorkes of the lawe, but by faithe alone as the Gentiles haue. Again. Si enim gentes fides sola non saluat, nec nos, quia ex operibus legis nemo iustificatur. If faithe alone doth not saue the Gentiles, no more doth it saue vs, for no manne is iustified by the workes of the lawe. And vpon these wordes of Paule. In fide vino filij dei. In sola fide quia nihil debeo legi antiquae. Abiecta enim est gratia, si mihi sola non sufficit. I liue saieth Paule by the faithe of the soonne of God, that is saieth Ierome by faithe alone, for I owe nothing to the olde lawe. For grace is cast awaie, if it alone bee not sufficient for me. And Cap. 3. Spiritum sanctū sola fide accepistis, qui non nisi à iustis accipitur: iustos autem sine legis operibus vos esse constat. You haue receiued ye holy ghoste by faith alone, whiche is not receiued but of righteous persons. And it is plain that you are righteous with out the woorkes of the lawe.

Moreouer. Abraham eredidit deo, &amp; reputatum. &amp;c. Ita &amp; vobis ad iustitiam sola sufficit fides. Abraham beleued GOD, and it was accoumpted to hym for righteousnes. So faithe alone is sufficiente for you also to righteousnesse. Furthermore in the same Chapiter. Quaeritur sane hoc loco si fides sola sufficiat Christiano, &amp; vtrū non sit maledictus, qui Euangelica praecepta contemnet. Sed fides ad hoc proficit, vt in primitijs credulitatis accedentes ad deum iustificet, si deinceps in iustificatione permaneant. Caeterum sene operibus fidei, non legis, mortua est fides. It is in deede demaunded in this place, if faithe alone bee sufficiente for a Christian man, and whether he is not accursed, that shall despise the preceptes of the Gospell. But faithe profiteth thus farre, that in the beginning of beleuyng, it iustifieth those that come vnto god, if afterward thei cōtinue in iustification. But without the workes of faith not of the lawe, faithe is deade. Also speakyng of the lawe. Quia nemo illam seruat ideo dictum est quod sola fide iustificandi essent credentes. Because no manne keepeth the lawe, therefore it is saied, that the beleuers must bee iustified by faithe alone. Also

so vt sola fide Gentès benedicerentur, in Christe sicut promssum est Abrahae, that the Gentiles might bee blessed, by faithe alone in Christe, as it was promised to Abraham. Also▪ 
                  Lex autem non est ex fide nam iustificat sola fides. The lawe is not of faithe, for faithe alone dooeth iustifie. Againe, necesse est sola fide saluari credentes. It is necessarie, that the beleuers should be saued by faith alone. Againe Aequaliter &amp; Iudaei, &amp; Gentes per solam fidem filij dei estis, qua credidistis Christo. Bothe Iewes, and Gentiles, you are a like the sonnes God, by faithe alone, by which you haue geuē credite to Christ. Also vpon the v. Chapiter. In sola fide crucis dico esse salutem, I saie, that saluation cō
                  sisteth in faithe alone of the crosse: That is, of the death of Christ. And vpon the vj. Chapiter. In sola fide spes collocatur animarum, In faithe alone resteth the hope of soules. Also vpon the Episto. ad Ephes. ij. Gratia saluati estis, non meritis prioris vitae sed sola fide. You are saued by grace, not by merites of your former life, but by faithe alone.
               Also vpon these wordes, Legem mandatorum in decretis abrogans) per solam fidem,

iustificans, moralia sola decernēs. Abrogatyng the lawe of preceptes, that was in decrees iustifiyng by faithe onely, and decreeyng the morall preceptes, onely to bee obserued. And vpon these woordes, Per crucem interficiens inimicitias) per solam fidem crucis, quae nullum deterret, non enim grauis aut difficilis est, quam habere etiam latro potuit crucifixus. By his Crosse slaiyng the harted) by only faithe of his crosse which maketh no man afraied, for it is not heauie, or harde, whiche euen the Thiefe that was crucified might haue. Finally, vpon the Epist. ad Philip. iij. Where saincte Paule saieth, that he hath not the righteousnes, whiche is of the lawe, but that whiche is by the faithe of Christ Iesus he noteth: Sed illam quae a deo pro pace, &amp; sola fide collata. But I haue that righteousnesse, whiche is geuen properly of God, and by faithe alone, Ruffinus also, whiche otherwise was a greate aduersarie of sainct Hieromes, yet in this poincte, he is his verie frende, and of the same iudgemente, as he was the iudger of al learned men at that time, excepte Pelagius the arche heretike, and his fellowes. Ruffinus therefore, in his exposition of the

                  Crede, vpon the Article of remission of sinnes, writeth thus. Verum de remissione peccatorum sufficere debet sola eredulitas. Quis enim causas, aut rationem requirat, vbi indulgentia principalis est causa. But for remission of synnes onely, beliefe ought to suffice, for who should require causes, or a reson? where mercie is the principall cause? So that when iustification, is through remission of sinnes, as sainct Paule proueth out of the Psalme. xxxij And remission of synnes is obtained by faithe alone, who cā deny that iustificatiō is obtained by faithe alone. Sainct Augustine, although he doe not so often repeate the tearmes of faithe alone, yet no writer more often, nor more substancially setteth forthe the righteousnesse by faithe alone, and as he had specially more occasion, beyng troubled with the Pelagians, and Celestianes, in his confessions Libro. x. Capit. xxix. Tota spes mea, non nisi magna valde misericordia tua. Da quod iubes, &amp; iube quod vis. All my hope is nothing els, but thy exceadyng greate mercie (O God) Geue that thou commaundeste, and commaunde what thou wilte. Also in his Epistle to Sixtus. 105. Restat igitur vt ipsam

fidem vnde omnis iustitia sumit initium, propter quod dicatur ad ecclesiam in Cantico Canticorum venies, &amp; transies ab initio fidei, non humano quo isti extollūtur saluamus arbitiro, nec vllis praecaedētibus meritis, quoniā inde incipiāt bona quaecū
                     
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      sunt merita, sed gratuitum donū dei esse fateamur, si gratiā veram id est fine me ritis cogitamus. It remaineth therfore, that we doe not ascribe to the frée will of man, whereof these menne are so proude, nor to any merites goyng before, that haue faithe it self, of whiche all righteousnesse taketh his beginnyng (for whiche it is said vnto the Churche, in the Canticle, thou shalt come, and passe by the beginnyng of faithe) because that hereof all good merites, whatsoeuer thei be beginne: but that we confesse it to bee the free gifte of God, if we thinke of true grace, whiche is with out merites. Also in his 120. Epistle to Honoratus, speakyng of faithe: Ex hoc quippe in cipiunt bona opera ex quo iustificamur, non quia precesserunt iustificamur, For hereof beginne good woorkes, whereof we are iustified, wee are not iustified, because thei wente before. In his Enchiridion ad Laurentium Capite 99. Sola gratia redemptos disceruimus

cernimus à perditis quos in vnam perditionis concreuerit massam ab origine ducta causa communis. We discerne theim, that are redemed from those that are loste, by grace alone, whom the common cause, deriued from the beginnyng, hath bredde into one lumpe of perdition. Also in his booke De fide, &amp; operibus. Capit. 22. In illis duobus tota lex pendet, &amp; Prophetiae, licet recte dici posset ad solam fidem pertinere dei mandata, si non mortua sed viua illa intelligatur fides, quae per dilectionem operatur. In these twoo the whole lawe, and the Prophetes depēdeth, although it maie bee well saied, that the commaundementes of God, pertaine to faithe alone, if not, a deade faithe bee vnderstoode, but that liuely faithe, whiche worketh by loue. And in his treatise Octoginta trium questionum. lxviij. Ipsa eutem gratia, quae data est per fidem, nullis nostris meritis data est. The same grace, whiche is geuen through faith, is geuen to none of our merites. Also Quest. lxxvi Quapropter non sunt contrariae duorum Apostolorum sententiae Pauli, &amp; Iacobi, cum dicit vnus iustificari hominem per fidem sine operibus, &amp; alius dicit inanem esse fidem fine operibus, quia ille dicit

de operibus quae fidem praecedunt, iste de ijs quae fidem sequuntur, vt etiam ipse Paulus multis locis ostendit. Wherefore the sentences of the twoo Apostles, Paule, and Iames are not contrary, when the one saieth, that a manne is iustified by faithe, without workes, and the other saieth, that faithe without workes is vaine, because the one speaketh of woorkes goyng before faithe, the other of suche as followe faithe, as Paule hymself sheweth in many places. And that true faithe can not bee without good woorkes, he sheweth in his booke De fide &amp; operibus. Capi. xxiij. Inseperabilis quippe est bona vita a fide, quae per dilectionem operatur. Good life can not be separated from faith, whiche worketh by loue. Also in his booke De natura, &amp; gratia. Cap. xi. Fateor dilectioni vestrae, cum ista legerem repente laetitia perfusus sum, quod dei gratiam non negaret, per quam solam homo iustificari potest. Hoc enim in disputationibus talium maximè detestor &amp; horreo. I confesse vnto your charity, that whē I reade these thynges, I was sodainly filled with gladnes, because he denighed not the grace of God, by whiche a lone, a man can bee iustified, for that thyng in suche

mennes disputations, I dooe moste of all deteste, and abhorre. And in the Chapiter. xvj. Haec est fides ad quam praecepta compellū
                     
                        •
                      vt lex imperet, &amp; fides impetret, This is faith vnto whiche the commaundemētes doeth driue a man, that the lawe commaūdeth, and faithe obteineth. Also vpon the. lxvij. Psalme. Sine bonorum operum meritis per fidem iustificatur impius. The vngodlie man is iustified by faithe, without the merites of good workes. And vpon the 88. Psalme. Et quia sola fides in Christum mundat, nō credentes in Christum soluti sunt ab emundatione. And because faithe alone in Christ doeth clense, thei that beleue not in Christe, are free from clensing. But what should I tary longer, in rehearsyng sentences of Augustine, when so many bookes, Epistles, and Homelies of his are extante, whiche wholie, and purposely, were composed for the same matter, against the Pelagians? Paulinus also a learned manne, in saincte Augustines tyme, in an Epistle written to Augustine. Episto. 58. Hath these woordes. Quid enim sis ad salutem quae sola fide quaentur, prodest in legis memoria, et meditatione versari. &amp;c. What doeth it profite them,

to bee conuersante in the remembraunce, and meditation of the lawe, towardes saluation, whiche is sought by faithe alone. Marcus Heremita an aūcient gréeke writer in his treatise, of them that thinke they maie bee iustified by their woorkes writeth on this wise, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . The Lorde willing to shewe that euerie commaundement is of duety, and that the adoption is of gifte by his owne bloode saieth. When you haue doone all thinges that are commaunded you, then saie you, we are vnprofitable seruauntes, and wée haue doone that whiche we ought to haue doone: Therfore the kingdome of heauen is not the rewarde of workes, but the free gifte of the Lorde prepared for faithefull seruauntes. Faustus also an auncient Bishoppe in Fraunce writyng a boke de gratia

meritis &amp; libero arbitrio, hath these wordes. Tempus gratiae in quo redempti sumus, merita hominum non expectauit, opera penitus non quae siuit, sola deus fidei nostrae deuotione cō
                     tentus fuit iuxta illud apostoli, credidit Abraham deo, &amp; reputatum est ei ad iustitiam. The tyme of grace in whiche wee are redemed did not tary for the merites of men, did not require woorkes at all. But god was content with the onely deuotion of our faith accordyng to the saiyng of the Apostle, Abraham beleued god, and it was imputed to hym for rightousnes. And although Claudianus Mamertus Bishoppe of Gallia Viennensis, for his error concernyng Angelles in whiche he followed sainct Augustine dooeth confute hym, and Ioannes Maxentius Archebishop of Constantinople, for his opiniō of grace and merites in whiche he disagréeth from S. Augustine, reproueth him in his answere against the Epistle of Hormisda Archbishop of Rome: yet for excludyng merites from iustification no man findeth faulte with him. For the same Ioannes Maxentius cōcerning the free will of man, whereupon all merites are grounded, hath this catholike confession.

                  Liberum autem naturale arbitrium ad nihil aliud valere credimus, nisi ad discernenda tantum, &amp; desiderāda carnalia, siue saecularia, quae non apud deum, sed apud homines possunt fortasse videri gloriosa. Ad ea vero quae ad vitā aeternam pertinent, nec cogitare, nec velle, nec desiderare, nec perficere posse nisi per infusionē, &amp; inoperationē intrinsecus spiritus sancti. We beleue that naturall free will auaileth to nothing els, but onely to discerne and desire carnal or worldly thinges, which may perchaūce séeme glorious before men, but not before god. But for those thinges that pertaine to life euerlastynge, that it can neither thinke of them nor will them, nor desire thē, nor performe thē, but by the inward infusiō &amp; working of the holy ghost. And leste the iudgemente of this Ioannes should be doubted of, because he wrote againste the B. of Rome. This is the same Ioannes, whose confession the same Hormisida sent vnto the Bishoppes of Spaine as catholike and true. Albinus the schoole maister of Carolus magnus muche later in tyme, but in sentence all one with him, vpon the. 119. Psalme part. 19. writeth in this maner. Definit in nullo homini esse praesumendum,

nisi in sola dei pietate, quae ex miserit beatos facit, ex mortuis viuos. He determineth that a man must presume in nothing but in ye only mercie of god which of miserable maketh vs happy of deade mē aliue.
               Another godly man of good antiquitie, not so famous in name whiche of purpose he suppressed to auoide vaine glorie in all his writinges, callyng hymself Idiota, is neuerthelesse of the same opiniō in diuers places of his workes, especially in Regulis sancti viri. Quinta regula, quod in illis duodecim armis, nec in quocunque alio humano remedio confidas, sed in sola virtute Iesu Christi qui dixit, confidice ego vici mundum: &amp; alibi, princeps huius mundi eijcitur foras, quare &amp; nos sola eius virtute confidamus, &amp; mundum posse vincere, &amp; diabolum superare. The fifte rule of a godly mā is, that thou doe not trust in those twelue peeces of armour, nor in any other humane remedie, but in the onely vertue of Iesus Christ, which saieth be of good corage, I haue ouercome the world, &amp; in an other place, the prince of this world is cast out, wherfore lette vs trust by his vertue alone both to ouercome the world, and to vanquishe the Deuill. Also in his

booke de conflictu carnis, &amp; animae. Cap. 6. Tibi domine deus meus attribuitur quicquid pertinet ad potentiam: diuinam autem potentiam euidentius nihil manifestat, quam iustificare impium, hoc est trahere peccatorem, iuxta quod legitur, Deus qui omnipotentiam tuam parcendo maxime, &amp; miserando manifestas, melius enim est iustificare quam creare, cum creando detur natura, iustificando autem, &amp; auferatur culpa, &amp; conferatur gratia. To thée O lorde my god is ascribed, whatsoeuer perteineth to power, and there is nothing that setteth forthe the power of God more euidently, then to iustifie an vngodly man, that is to draw a sinner, accordyng as it is redde (O God whiche shewest thine almightie power most of all in sparyng and shewyng mercie) for it is a greater mater to iustifie, then to create, whereas in creating nature is geuen, but in iustifiyng sinne is taken awaie, and grace geuen. I will conclude with Venantius in his exposition of the Crede, wherein he followeth Ruffinus vppon the Article of remissiō of sinnes, &amp; vsing almost the very wordes of Ruffinus, saieth on this maner. Remissionem peccatorum nobis in hoc sermone

sola cre dulitas sufficit, nec ratio requiritur vbi principalis indulgentia comprobatur. Onely beliefe in this speache is sufficient to geue vs remission of sinnes, neither is any reason required, where mercie is proued to be the principall cause. Seiyng therfore that wee are compassed (as the Apostle saieth) with suche a cloude of witnesses, I cannot but meruaile with what face the aduersaries canne so cōfidently pronounce that the doctrine of iustification by faith alone, is newe doctrine neuer harde of in the Churche before this fortie or fiftie yeres. And for as muche as the witnesses are in nomber so many, in tyme so auncient, in learnyng so excellent, that of all men they are reuerenced, and séeyng their testimonies are so diuerse all to one ende, some affirmyng the doctrine in plaine termes, some yeldyng reasons therof, some shewyng proofes and argumentes for it, some aunsweryng obiections made against it, and euery one of these in seuerall wordes phrases and maners of speakyng, I am suer though subtiltie canne deuise, startyng holes to elude some of theim, all the crafte of the Deuill cannot bée able to auoide

theim al. And if the only admonitiō of August. be thought of you sufficient for both learned men and Christian menne, whiche is that a baren deade and vnstructfull faithe is not sufficient for saluation, what thinke you so many admonitions of so sundrie, both learned and christian writers, ought to woorke with all men, teaching that a true and liuely faith alone in the onely mercie of God by Iesus Christe doth iustifie? We agrée with Augustine, that a solitarie faith doth not iustifie, if you can as well agree with the scripture and almost all auncient Fathers, that a fruictfull faith alone doeth iustifie not by merite of the fructes, but by takyng holde of Gods mercie.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               And that which is most of all to be meruailed at, wheras the religion of this reformed Church hath lefte vs nothing to serue God withall, but this onely and alone faith whiche they doe affirme to suffice, they doe by the free choise and will of man denied, clene take awaie this onely faith also, like as al other gifts, &amp; graces, &amp; benefits vprising vnto man, by the death and blood sheding

of Iesus Christe. For so muche as the free will of manne is the seate of grace, and the mansion house of faieth, whereby faieth is produced and brought foorth by the grace of God, as chiefe agent and worker thereof, and in the will of man, as in an apte receptackle and place to receiue the same, when no man canne beleue but he that will. And therfore for man to beleue both these two thinges are necessarilie required. First is the acte of Gods grace, stirryng and mouynge the will of man therunto, second is the consente of mannes will to applie, and receiue the same, without the whiche consente of mannes will, Goddes grace knocketh all in vaine. As it appeareth by the citezeins of Hierusalem, vnto whom our sauior Christ saieth in the Gospell. Hierusalem, Hierusalem, whiche dooest slaie the Prophetes, and stonest them to death, that are sent vnto thee, how often tymes would I haue gathered thy children, like as a Henne gathereth her chickens, vnderneath her wynges, and thou wouldest not. I would saith christ, but thou O Ierusalē wouldest not. VVherby it appeareth, that god by his grace doth not worke his belefe in the soule of man, as

in a stocke, or in a stone, with out any consente of mans parte, to be geuen thervnto, whē there is no man, that can by any other meane, receiue faithe, then by the consente of his owne will, and therefore in the worke of faithe, Gods grace, and mans will muste consente, and ioigne together bothe. The Apostle saincte Paule, in witnesse thereof saieth, by the grace of God, I am that I am, and his grace in me was not in vaine, but I haue laboured more aboundantly then thei all, and not I saieth saincte Paule, but the grace of God with me, and not without me as workyng before in me, and without my consente, but mecum, with me. For Augustine saieth, that almightie God, whiche in the beginnyng, did create manne, without any consent, askyng of manne therevnto, he will not nowe iustifie manne constreinedly, and whether he will or not, but with his owne consente, will, and desir
                     •
                   therevnto. For the kyngdome of heauen, saieth our sauiour Christ suffereth violence and the onely violente menne, whiche here will trauaile, laboure, and fight therefore, shalbe partakers of that kyngdome. VVhē the ioyes of heauen are not so vile, nor so

meane thynges, like as the Apostle saincte Paule saieth, but thei are worthe the labouryng for: seyng therefore it can not bee denied, without deniall of the expresse testimonies of the scriptures, but that the consente of mannes will, must necessarily come with Goddes grace to receiue faithe, therefore, in the deniyng of the consent of mannes will, thei deny faithe, and thus in fine, the religion of this newe reformed churche is brought (all circumstaunces beyng duely examined) from onely faithe, and faithe alone, to haue no faithe at all.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               It is a greate marueile to see you, and suche as you are, that boaste of your free will, to bee so obstinately blinde, that you will not see the truthe, but that wee dooe acknowledge the iuste iudgement of God in those that striue against him. But to auoide al your cauilling of free will, where by you goe about to amase the vnderstandyng, of suche as bee simple, I will firste shewe, what we teache of free will, and then aunswere your peuishe Sophistrie. And because the name of free will, is ambiguous, and of diuers significations, it is

expediente, to sette foorthe the sonderie meanynges thereof. Free will is sometymes taken as it is contrary to coacted or constrained will. Sometymes as it is contrary to a seruile, or bonde wille. And sometymes as it is, the election of that, whiche seemeth good, and is contrary to refusyng. But in the ambiguitie, of the twoo former significations, all the doubte of this controuersie dooeth consiste, wherof we determine after this maner. That manne before his falle, had free will, in euery respecte: he might haue chosen freely without any lette, or compulsion, that whiche was good in deede, and acceptable to God: For there was in his nature, nothyng to prouoke hym to euill. But man after his falle, bothe in hymself, and in all his posteritie, hath vtterly loste that free will, whiche I make the seconde meaning of the woorde, and hath his will, now altogether seruile, and bounde, so that he can will nothyng of hym self, that is good, and acceptable before God. And therefore the scripture saieth. Genesis the. vj. and viij. That all the immaginations of the thoughtes of mennes hartes, are onely

euill continually. Our sauiour Christ also Matth. xv. teacheth, that out of the corrupte harte of manne, proceadeth all wickednesse. And saincte Paule. ij. Corin. iij. affirmeth, that we are not apte 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   of our selues, as of our selues, to thinke any thyng, that perteineth to the glorie of God. With an infinite noumber of places beside, to the same effect, through out the Scripture, declaryng that before we be regenerate, and borne a newe, wée can will nothyng but that whiche is well. Neuerthelesse, wee dooe not deny, that a manne hath free will in the firste meanyng, for although his wille is bonde, and slaue vnto synne, before it bee made free, by the grace of God, yet is it not compelled, nor enforced by any externall coaction or Stoicall necessitie vnto euill, but volū
                  tarily embraceth that, whiche is euill, and delighteth therein, and voluntarily doeth refuse goodnesse, and pleaseth it self in ille doyng. As for the thirde kinde of free will, whiche is an appetite, or election of that, whiche seemeth good, continueth in man after his fall (but yet subiecte to Gods prouidence) whereby he guideth all his

externall actions, but this is vnproperly called free wille, and therefore maie bee well omitted in this disputation. The whole matter of doubte resteth therefore in this, whether a manne hath his will so free, and vncorrupted, that he can discerne any thyng in true godlinesse, and applie hym selfe to receiue it. And here in this your discourse, a manne can hardely perceiue, whether you defende free will simplie with the Pelagians, or partly with the Papistes. But this is the maner of you all, to shewe your self, where you dare for shame, plaine Pelagians in deede, for all your diuinitie of free wil, is out of Aristotle and not out of Gods woorde, but when you be pressed with the aucthoritie of scripture, to flie to some sorie shift of defence. But it is all one in a maner, to confute the Pelagians, and you, when it is proued out of the woorde of God, that the grace and goodnesse of God, woorketh all together, whatsoeuer is good in them that are regenerate. For it is neither of hym that willeth, nor of hym that runneth, but of GOD onely, that sheweth the mercie. Therefore it is no harde mater, to auoide

moste of your cauillations, with that one distinction of free will, whiche is either free from coaction, and compulsion, or free from corruption, and bondage vnto synne. As when you wrangle of the receiuing of faithe, that no manne beleueth but he that will, I aunswere, no manne is compelled to beleue, but he that beleueth, dooeth beleue willingly, and of his owne accorde, but that he hath a wille to beleue, is not of hymself, but of God. For GOD dooeth not onely offer mercie to our wille, but also geueth vs a wille to receiue it. As saincte Paule testifieth, God woorketh in vs, bothe to will, and to performe whatsoeuer is good, and pertainyng to our saluation. Phili. ij. And where God giueth not a will, there menne can not beleue, though grace, and mercie bee offered vnto theim. As saincte Ihon testifieth in the. xij. Chapiter of his Gospell, that the Iewes after so longe preachyng, and so many miracles woorkyng emong thē, did not beleue in him, and thei did not beleue, because thei could not beleue in hym, for that God, accordyng to the Prophecie of Esaie, had geuen theim ouer, into

a reprobate mynde. But if euery man had free will, as you defende it, it mighte not bee truely saied of any menne, thei could not beleue, because God had blinded their iyes, and hardened their harte. For you holde, that euery manne maie beleue that wille, and that euery manne hath this wille, in his owne power. And the firste parte of the sentence in some respect maie be graunted, that eche manne maie beleue that wille, but the seconde parte is altogether false, that eche manne hath this wille in his power. But those onely whom God hath appoincted to saluation, he maketh willyng to beleue, that thei maie bee saued.
               And whereas you quarell, that Christe would haue gathered, and Hierusalem would not, it maketh nothyng to proue, that the Iewes had power of their wille, to receiue Christe, whiche sainct Ihon vtterly denieth, saiyng, thei could not beleue. And concerning the will of God, and Christe, you should not bee ignoraunte of that distinction, whiche youre Sentiaries dooeth acknowledge. That there is one will of Goddes determination, and an other

of his precepte, or commaundement, whiche thei call voluntatem signi. As when GOD commaunded Abraham, to kill his soonne, he declared one wille by his commaundemente, and yet the ende declared that he willed not the deathe of Isaac. These diuerse willes, are not repugnant in God, neither dooeth he intende, contrary thynges by theim, but suche as maie well stande together. For he determined to saue Isaac, for his promise sake, and yet to trie the obedience of Abraham, by the commaundemente. So when Christe preached to Hierusalem, he determined to call those onely, that were elect of God, and yet to make the other inexcusable, when he offered mercie vnto theim, and they by no meanes would receiue it. The reste that you adde, of the consent of mannes will, to bee necessarie vnto iustification, is so impertinent, that I muse what you meaned to speake one woorde of it. For who euer saied that God woorketh in the faithe of a manne as in a Stocke or Stone, or who euer denied the consent of a mannes will to be required in beleuing? This is no parte of the questiō. But whether

euery mā that is not predestinat of god to saluation, hath it in his power to consent vnto faith, that he maie bee iustified, and so be saued, which is cleane to ouerthrowe the election and predestination of God, which is the chief foundatiō of our faith, &amp; consequētly to ouerthrow the power, wisdome, glorie and aucthoritie of God ouer his creatures. For if euery able and scilful workeman, determineth of the ende and vse of his workemanship, before he beginneth it: with what reason can we take that frō ye creator of all thinges, who as Salomon witnesseth, made all thinges for his owne glory, euen the wicked man for the daie of his wrath. Your conclusion is verie clerkely, that we haue driuē all thinges to faith alone, &amp; whē all is duely examined, wee haue no fathe at all. When Zeno had disputed longe that there was no mouynge, Diogenes walked vp and doune his scole, and beeyng demaunded, what he was doing, he aunswered I am confuting of Zeno his argumentes. In whiche behauour he shewed a dooble example of wisedome, first because he vouchesaued not to aūswere the subtilties of Zeno in so vaine a matter, &amp; secondly for that his sensible action, did sufficiently confute the Philosophers vaine speculation.

We will therefore holde our peace in this case, and let the matter it self speake for vs. If it were not that wee had faithe to Godward, why should we troble our selues in this controuersie of religion? If we sough riches, honour, pleasures, or whatsoeuer the outwarde man can wishe for, where should we sooner finde it, then in Popery? If wee sought any thing in this life by our professiō, why should we not leaue it in time of persecution? Let the life &amp; death therfore of theim that haue suffered martirdome for our religion, declare whether for maintenaunce of faithe and truste in God, or for confidence in the worlde, we haue taken this contention in hande. But seing you are disposed to dally with vs in deniyng our faithe, you shal geue me leaue to disproue in good earnest, your iustification. For if you haue none other but these thrée, which al learnyng (you saie) doth agree of, I suppose it not vnpossible by your owne learning, to cōuince that iustification in papistry, is either very vaine, or els none at all. And because your distinction is so preposterus of it self, it shal not be against order to begin with the last kinde firste, whiche is (you saie) when of a iust mā is made a more iust mā. If no man be iust, how can there be

degrees in iustification? If the scripture teache (as I wene you wil not deny) that all men are sinners, and that no sinner is iust, then no man can bee made of a iuste manne more iuste. But because I promised to deale with you rather by youre owne learnyng, thē by scriptures, if I can disproue your two first kindes of iustification, the third muste needes vanishe awaie of it selfe. Iustificatiō by baptisme is your first kind, by penaunce, your second kinde. If a childe be iustified by Baptisme, &amp; die in that state of iustification, he cometh not into purgatorie. And therfore néedeth neither Dirge nor Masse to be saide for hym: but by saiyng Dirge and Masse for such one, you acknowledge him to be in purgatorie, therfore you confesse he is not iustified. And so your owne catholike doinges denie your learned saiynges of iustification by Baptisme. Lette vs see if iustification by penaunce be any thing surer. When a manne hath shryuen himself, &amp; receiued absolution, I trowe you will saie hee is iustified by penaunce. But so soone as he is gone from the Prieste, if he fall into deadlie sinne, he is become lapsus again. And it is the doctrine of al the Sententiaries, yt euery euil desier, with consente is deadlie sinne, as if the partie,

that is shriuen, when he cometh out of the church, seeth a faire woman, &amp; lusteth after her, he hath cōmitted adulterie in his harte with her, if he méete his enemie, &amp; desire reuengement, he is a murtherer. If he behold any house, land, or other goods, &amp; cattelles, that is not his, and couet it, he breaketh the x. commaundement, &amp; so of the rest. Wherfore, so so
                     •
                  e as euer hee thinketh an euill thought, after his absolution, all the fatte is in the fire, he hath loste his iustification. So that he must be shriuen ten thousand tymes in a yere, or els he must not tary, but a short while in his iustification. A miserable conscience or none at al, must that man haue, that trusteth to suche a iustification. But you wil saie, he needeth not to fall by concupiscence so often. But I saie, hee is a false hypocrite, that dare so saie, of hym selfe. Sainct Paule was not inferiour to any man, in the grace of regeneration, and yet he confesseth, that there was an other Lawe in his members, whiche was resistaunte to the lawe of his minde, &amp; so far preuailed, that it brought him continually, captiue vnto the lawe of synne, in so much that it did wryng out of him, this pathetical exclamation: miserable man that I am, who shal deliuer me from this bodie of

synne? And findeth no other comforte, but the mercie of GOD in Christe Roma. vij. Wherefore seeyng both the firste iustifications faile, the thirde muste needes fall, and therefore excepte you canne finde another iustification you are like to haue none at all at lest wise of any value to make you rightous by your owne learnyng.
            
            
               The Papiste.
               My poore witte, learnyng, and conscience being fully perswaded, that al the premises, be of suche truthe, and veritie, as I haue expressed. I thought it good to make declaratiō ther of chiefly for discharge of cōscience, and partly to meete with this common obiectiō, that we haue nothyng to saie, but stande wholie vpon a wilfull frowardnesse, obstinacie, and vainglory, hauing neither scripture, doctour, argument nor reason to alledge, for the defence of the matter, that wee stande in. And for some triall to be made of my fidelitie, and truth, in the allegatiōs of the premisses, I doe offer my self to turne the bookes of the scriptures, doctours, and holy fathers, whē wher, and before whom I shall bee called. And by the bokes beeyng indifferently redde, iudge betwixte vs. Doubtlesse this is the whole desire, and intente I had in the writing hereof, &amp;

not any other desire, I had of liberty, enlargemente, or heare to liue. For what desire should a christian man haue, to liue in that Realme, that sleaeth them that would their wealth, and is angrie with them that would helpe their euilles, what desire should a christen man haue, to liue in that realme, that setteth naught by, and destroyeth, those that dooe watche, and praie to doe good, and setteth by those, that do watch, and trauaile for to doe euill? VVho would desire to liue in suche a Realme, where the Elders, and aunciente menne thereof, the wise, godly, and verteous, doe liue discontented, and wheras the youth, witlesse, gracelesse, and vitious, doe liue best contented, and pleased? who would desire to liue in that Realme, where suche vices are of subiectes openly cō
                  mitted, whiche in all other Christian realmes thei feare to doe in secrete? and where all that thei desire, thei procure, and all that thei procure, thei doe attaine, and all that is euill, thei thinke, and all that thei thinke, thei saie, and all that thei saie, thei maie dooe, and that that thei may dooe, thei dare do, and putte in operation. And therfore, I can haue by no righte reason, any desire of enlargemente of libertie, or yet hope any while to liue.
            
            
               The aunswere.
               
                  A man may doubte for al your protestatiō whether your wit, learnyng and conscience bee so persuaded of all the premisses, as youpretēde: of which some be so absurde, that no man of any witte or learnyng canne be perswaded in theim. And whereas you thinke you haue aunswered the common obiection that you haue nothing to saie, I suppose by the iudgemente of wise menne you haue rather confirmed the same, that either you haue nothyng to saie, or that which you saie is nothing to the purpose. Youre fidelitie in the allegations shoulde better haue appeared, if you had noted the places at the firste, which either must bee imputed to fraude or to lacke of bokes that it was omitted, but by notyng of some places it shoulde seeme you wanted no bookes, and your streight keping I suppose is not suche, but you might haue had bokes if you list. You cōclude your Apology with an odious diffamatiō of the whole state of our princes gouernemente, which if it haue failed in anie poincte, it was in ouer muche clemencie shewed towardes suche as you are. It cannot be denied, but menne of good profession are oftentymes wicked in liuyng, and many of no profession be a slander to those of true religion. But howe soeuer

menne be malicious and vngodly bente, the state alloweth theym not, but punisheth theim, that by order of lawe are conuicted to be suche. Wherfore to make suche an outcrie, as though nothing but murther oppresssion, filthines and all kinde of vngodlines, yea nothing els but a confusion of al wickednes were openly mainteined: it sauoureth neither of truthe, nor of the spirite of God, nor of the affection of a good subiect. If Nero Domitian or Heliogabalus raged in the world, with what other Rhethorike would you haue painted out their regiment then this that you haue abused againste this present gouerment? the praise whereof if the present age enuie, the posteritie will merueile at it, when neither in memorie nor in monumentes beyng compared without afffection, the like shall euer be founde before it. God geue all true Subiectes grace to bee thankefull for it, and so to behaue themselues therein, that through his mercie it maie be many yeres more, most happelie continued.
            
            FINIS.
