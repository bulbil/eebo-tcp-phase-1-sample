            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            To all our Christian Brethren in Englande, which wayte for the kingdome of Christ, increase of the knowledge of the trueth bee multiplied vnto them, with strēgth and patience, and perseuerance vnto the ende.
            
               
                  MY state is known vnto manie of you (my Brethren) how that of certaine time (though weakely &amp; vntowardly) I haue striuē, and withstood the yoke of spiritual bondage in the worshippe of God, which the man of perdition haue yet left behinde for our sifting and trial. Frō the which that I might bee deliuered (the Lorde God the searcher of heartes I take to recorde) that it haue bene myne onlie quarell, and the cause of stirring me vp to do that, which I did. Concerning the whiche cause, I did not thinke it lawefull for mee (though I coulde haue escaped in time ynough) to withdraw my selfe into any other place, for myne owne liberties sake, vntill I had more openly witnessed the same cause. Which when it seemed good vnto God, that I with some others should doo, by abyding imprisonment a certayne time: Then hauing

offered our selues to suffer whatsoeuer our vexers should lay vpon vs, and espyinge nothing like to be done vnto vs, but to bee holden with lingering imprisonement, and that without libertie of communicating vnto others the instruction of the same cause, which we professed: wee thought good rather to vndergoe some exile (as it were) for redeeming at least some libertie of worshipping God with safetie of conscience. Which when we did, and diuers of our Brethren, which were willing to come vnto vs were restrayned: and we were persuaded, that to returne vnto them thither, whereas by imprisonment we should againe be holden from them, would litle anayle: I haue iudged that we haue bene debters to them to bestow vpon them some thing which might helpe to increase their spirituall courage and comforte. In which behalfe, when the expectation of me and diuers others rested vppon some, who in the ende did but slenderlie answere, and satisfie thesame: Then I, which for my vnworthines and poore gifte, hadde thought neuer to haue set foorth any thinge publikely, yet was prouoked to indeuour my selfe, in some parte, as farre as the Lorde should make me able, to satisfie that want, which I thought to be great. And I went about a piece of work touching Church gouernement. But partlie by sicknes, &amp; partly by weying the cost of the print, and findinge it to be aboue my reache of abilitie: I was hindered, and haue let staye that worke, vntill the Lorde further inable mee.
            
               In the meane tyme I thought good to write some other little treatse, and I chose this 122. Psalme, thinking thereby to haue occasion ministred to speak of diuers of those pointes, which concerne the cause mētioned. And I was determined to haue spokē somewhat brieflie vpon the whole Psalme. But in the firste entraunce meetinge with those pointes, which I thought good they should be discussed somewhat largelie for edifyinge sake: Agayne, sicknes and other causes cutting me short: I was constreined to ende at this time skarce finishing the firste verse. Neyther was it my desire to seeme to speak much vppon a little Texte, (yea I confesse that I haue passed the boundes of Scholler like handeling the Text) but the thinges which offered them selues to be spoken of, seemed to my iudgement to require so much measure. Herein my desire vnto the lord is, that my poore labour may be accepted of him, and may be profitable to his people.
         
         
            
            
               J Would haue the Reader aduertised, that whereas in one place of this boke, I haue these woords: The Authour to the Hebrewes speake of certaine Christians, which were racked, &amp;c. My meaning was not, but that I iudged him to speake especially of those which suffered persecution, before the comming of Christ in the fleshe: which beleuing in Christ to come, may also well be called by the name of Chrstians. Yet after it was printed, I suspecting that it might be an occasion of cauilling to some: I thought good to sett downe a word or two of my meaning therin.

               I reioyced when they saide vnto me▪ We will goe into the house of the Lorde.
            
            
               RIght well is it said, that wher ye treasure is, there will the harte bee also:
                  Mat. 6.19. which thing is seene in this seruant of the Lorde, who behaued him selfe worthelie in the Arke bringinge home. And as it was the Lordes worke, so did he carefullie acquite him selfet, hat the curse shoulde not laye holde on him,
                  Iere. 48.10. whiche belongeth to the working of the Lordes worke negligentlie. But that he did, hee did with all his power, and when hee had finished his ioyfull worke, his ioye was not ended, but rebowned agayne and agayne, with a sweete Echo in his soule. So as it was meate and drinke

to him to doo the will of God: so was it also his pleasure to thinke and muse vpon the same, and he hath conceyued the grace of Gods spirite, and hath brought foorth this Psalme, as the fruite of so godlie a meditation, leauing vs a glasse and paterne wherein to see the spottes of our deformed and lothesome negligence, and a lanterne he hath set bright before vs, that wee may see to take our waye to goe and laye hande on the Lordes plought, to doo his acceptable worke. Out of whose example and wordes in this Psalme, wee minde, by the good furtherance of God, to gather some aduertisementes to stirre our selues vp, yet whyles it is called to day,
                  Hebr. 3.13. least we should be hardned through the deceitfulnes of sinne.
            First we haue to speake of his ioye and the cause thereof, the remēbrance of which, he doth now feede vpon, and chewe the cudd vpon this ioye of that happie daye, whiche hee thus remembreth.
                  Psal. 78.71. The Lorde chose Dauid from the sheepe folds to feede his people in

Iacob and his inheritance in Israel. And as it is spoken of him that he fed them in the simplicitie of his harte,
                  Ver. 72. so did it euē appeare in his first entrance of his kingdome. For nothinge helde him carefull in comparison of this, to haue the Lorde to vouchsafe to come home agayne vnto his people, and to be at peace with them, to loue them, &amp; remoue shame and rebuke farre from them, by returninge his holie Arke, the token of his presence, and the liuelie image of his countenance vppon them, as the taking away thereof was the turning his backe vpon them, and turning awaye his face, as hee hadde threatned before for sinne.
                  Deut. 31.1
                     •
                  
                And it was the reprochefull steyning of the glorie of Israel: as it sayde, The glorie is departed from Israel,1. Sā. 4.22. for the Arke of God is taken. Therfore was the care of Dauid, &amp; his zeale set on fyre within his brest, which thing he mightely declared, and the 
                  ••
               aine thereof appeared, when he sware vnto the Lord and vowed a vowe vnto the mightie God of Iacob, saying,
                  Psal. 132.
                     •
                  . I will not enter into

the Tabernacle of mine house, nor come vpon my palet or bedde, nor suffer myne eyes to sleepe, nor mine eyeliddes to slumber, vntill I haue found out a place for the Lorde, an habitation for the mightie God of Iacob. Now although it be my purpose, and order requireth to hasten to the cause of Dauids ioye, which he heare mentioneth, yet it standeth with dewe order in this place, as it doeth with edifying to stande vppon his great care, in wayting for that thing, whiche being obteyned, this his ioye succeeded. For liuelie and sounde is that ioye which the harte feeleth, when it is refreshed frō care &amp; griefe going before.
            When the Lorde had deliuered his soule out of all aduersities, which hee susteyned in the dayes of Saul, and had brought him to the glorie of his kinglie Throne: herein he shewed the simplicitie of a true harte, in that hee was not chaunged by the suddain alteratiō, nor his hart beguyled by those pleasures, to cause him to forget God. He was not highe minded,
                  Psal. 131.1. hee had no

proude lookes. But he kept his soule, as a childe that is weyned frō his mothers brest. Yea at this time he throughlie weined him self, frō taking pleasure in anie thing, vntill the Arke of God should be brought home &amp; placed in Israel, which hee calleth by ye name of the Lorde,
                  Psal. 13
                     •

                and the mightie God of Iacob. Therevnto doth he sweare and vow, not to haue regard vnto his own tabernacle nor house, not to coūt it his home, or settle him selfe therein, neyther to take any sound rest vntil he had seene this busines of the Lord in dew forwardnes. Thus was hee thankfull vnto the Lorde, whiche had remēbred him, and all his afflictions.
            Let vs examine our selues &amp; call to minde the yeeres that are past, when the fyrie sworde did hange ouer oure heades in the dayes of Queene Marie, &amp; that by so weake a threede, that we looked euerie houre when it should fall vpon vs, whē we being straungers frō our own houses, walked frō house to house, at suche time as the Owles and Backes looke foorth and flye:

And thought it well if wee might liue so without house or land, or ought else saue bare breade for the life.
            We were as the Iewes which by Hamans meanes were solde to bee slaine,
                  Ester. 3.13. and destinate to a day of death. And we were as humble Hester, whiche would make no request but for life onelie.
                  Ester. 7.3. Nowe when wee sighed and cried for the bondage, and the crie for our bondage came vp vnto God,
                  Exod. 3.33. and God hearde our mone, &amp; remembred his couenant: Then hee brought agayne our captiuitie,
                  Psal. 126.1 as hee did of Iacob: then were we like vnto them that dreamed. Euen for sodeine ioye, doubting whither we dremed those happie tydinges, or no. Then was our mouth filled wt laughter, &amp; our tongue wt ioy. Thē the Nations about vs said, that ye lord had don great things for vs. And we sang thervnto, the Lord haue done great things for vs, whereof wee reioyce. Christ Iesus seemed then to vs as a shining and burning Lampe, and we seemed for that time to reioyce in the light thereof. But our giuinge of

thankes and singing prayse vnto god, was skarse so good as that of the people of Israel, mentioned in the fourth Chapter of Exodus,
                  Exod. 4.31. who when they hearde that the Lord had visited them, and had looked vpon their tribulatiō, they bowed downe and worshipped. But when tribulation was increased vppon them,
                  Exod. 16.2. they murmured against God and his seruaunt Moyses. So could we bowe downe and worshippe in the day of our deliuerance, but since that time, not through bitter afflictiō as did they, but through too much pā
               pering with more fleshe, then ye pottes of Egypt haue, we haue waxen fatte, and haue forgotten the day of our penurie and hunger. Yea wee haue forgotten, and forsaken the Lorde the holie one of Israel, in that wee are gone backewarde. And better hath the Oxe knowne his owner,
                  Esa. 1.3. and the Asse his maisters cribbe, then we haue known him that saued vs. For if wee knewe him, we would also surelie know, that he redeemed vs from that firie fornace that we should burne with more zeale

of furthering his kingdome vpō earth to the aduauncing of his glorie. But the people of Englande in that daye whē the Lorde did lift vp their heads, were farre from the zeale and practise of Dauid, who beinge aduaunced to his kingdome, had not yet the thinge he would haue, and gaue him selfe no rest, vntill he had done dewe homage vnto the Lordes kingdome, by furthering, procuring, and labouringe about those things whiche appertayned vnto the true worshippe of God, vntill he did see them at a good staye. But our Cleargie firste, which should with great affliction haue laboured about the Lords worke, to haue seene that firste finished, before they hadde instauled them selues into their owne rowmes: they contrariewise layde holde on the great liuings, catch who catche might the riche Bishoprikes and fatte Benefices.
            And as Achsaph the daughter of Caleb,
               
                  Iosua. 15.19 when her father hadde giuen her a portion of highe grounde, desired still more, namelie, places with

springes of water: so was their desiring, and desiring agayne. For those whiche were serued with Benefices where corne grounde was most, they must haue an other, wher good store of pasture lie. And whē they were serued wt that, they muste long for one where store of sheepe are kept, and then they thinke they should be well. But would to god, it had bin no worse affection &amp; desire, then yt of Achsaph, which desired the increase of her portion of that lande, which the Lorde had giuen and blessed vnto her people: but these men haue bene greedie of the fatte spoyle, and haue not bene aware that it was the spoyle of Iericho, which ought not to haue bene medled withall, but to haue bene execrable thinges vnto vs. I meane not as though that wealthful spoile might not haue bin takē vse of,
                  Iosua. 6.17. by conuerting it another waye. But those things holding still their nature &amp; strēgth which thei receiued of ye Cananitish Roman, ought to haue bin to vs execrable things. And euen as the lord gaue vnto ye children of Israel the first

cōquest in ye land of Canaan, namely, ouer Iericho, without bowe or sword, horse,
                  Iosu. 6. horseman, or anie battle, or anie hande mouing of theirs, in token that he would alwayes stande on their right hand, and their victories should proceede from him, if they would goe forwarde to fight the Lordes battell: so the Lorde gaue vs this victorie, not with noise of battle, or tumblinge of garmentes in bloude, but by his own hande alone from heauen, the thing to vs vnlooked for, thereby incouraging vs to marche forwarde vnder his banner, and vnder the good lucke of this watcheword: The Lord liueth, which brought the children of Israel out of Egypt and out of Babel, &amp; the Lorde liueth which haue brought agayne the captiuitie of his poore suppliantes, from the yron yoke of Antichrist: and the Lorde also giuing vs the earnest of assured victorie in those battels which were to insue in the behalfe of his sonnes kingdome, against his professed enimie Antichrist, if we would haue bene so gracious, as once to

haue taken them in hande. But we refused to goe to the battle anie more, though the Cananite dwelled still in the lande, and bare the sworde to slaye euerie true Israelite therewith. I meane that man of Rome, who by his Cananitishe offices, and Canons of his lawes, standing still in their strengthe, beareth the scepter right vp, euē a rodde for the righteous. Thus haue we behaued our selues, not as faithful Iosua, and his souldiours, whiche frō Iericho ceassed not to goe forward to more battels, and therein sawe ye great saluation of God fightinge for them, when the Sunne and Moone stoode still in heauen,
                  Ioshua. 1
                     •
                  .13. and hasted not to goe downe for a season. But we haue done more like the Amalekites, whiche inuaded Zicklag, which did eate, drinke, and daunce manie dayes,1. Sā. 30.16. because of the great spoyle they had taken, vntill suddaine slaughter &amp; vengeance came vpon thē in the middest of their mirth. So let vs take heed, that wee do not so long eate and drinke of the spoyle, and daunce in securitie, vntill that Dauid

Christ Iesus come at vnawares, and take awaye all, and our liues therewith also in most iust iudgement.
            Wee also haue done as that other generation of the Iewes which arose vp after Iosua, which regarded their owne ease more then the Lords commaundement, and his glorie, which stoode vpon the rootinge out of those wicked ones, whose sinne was ripe &amp; their daie was come: those Cananites Perezites, and Iebuzits suffered they to dwell still amonge them. Therefore the Lorde saide, that they shoulde be thornes to their sides,
                  Iudg. 2.3. and their Gods should be their destruction, as it came to passe. Euen so haue we tenne times more made couenant with that cursed broode of Antichrists birdes, not only entring into neare familiaritie with the men, but also borowing manie of their ceremonies, intertaining their forme of seruice for the most part, being turned but from Latin to English: and yet which is worse, holding our neckes vnder their gyrdles, by making our selues willing slaues to their

Ecclesiasticall sworde. And because this practise could sonest be atchiued, and this vngracious work could most spedelie be iumbled vp: then was it counted Pollicie, to wipe mens noses with, and to giue them amocke. But be not deceiued, God is non mocked, who redemed you from aduersitie to this ende, that you should deale wisely and faithfullie in all his house. Therefore it did stand you vpon to haue takē better aduisement in the reforming of religion, and matters about Gods worshippe, knowinge that aboue all thinges it is a matter most curious. And you shoulde with feare and much trembling, setting apart your owne effaires for a season, as Dauid did here and that with a solemne vow making, that you would first seeke the building of Gods kingdome: you should thus, I say, haue bene conuersant in this busines, knowing that thē all things wold haue prospered with you. You shoulde also haue known yt the lord in his worship might not admit ani strang deuise vnder pretense of pleasing some, nor might

admit anie mingling of his wisedome with mennes wisedome, anie tolerations of vanities with a smoothe and fayned promise to take them away in time to come. Why did the Lorde shewe such a terrible and fearefull example vpon the two sonnes of Aaron, Nadab &amp; Abihu,
               
                  Leui. 10.1. as to skortche them with fire from heauen? Because they tooke fire for their censeres, from the hearth, whiche they should haue taken from the Altar. And they were but yong schollers in those ceremonies, &amp; the obseruations were manie, and it was at the firste beginninge of their trayning to practise: yet the Lordes ielousie burned wt fire. And why? Had the Lord so great regarde, for a coale of fire? was it not to leaue a fearfull monument for all men to beholde, that they might take heed least in matters pertaining to the worshippe of God, they alter and chaunge euen the least thinge? If any man want skill, let him withdrawe himselfe. For it is written: Take heed to thy foote when thou entrest into the house of God,
                  Ecclesiastes 4.17. &amp; be more

neare to heare, then to giue the sacrifice of fooles, for they knowe not that they doo euill. Beholde, howe manie in the Realme of England haue done and dailie doo presume to set in their feete into Gods house, and haue not learned how to sacrifize aright. Offer not they the sacrifice of fooles? And they will not knowe that they do euill.
            But to returne to those which haue bene chiefe maister workemen in the reformation of religion at the f
                  •
               rste: Can they not beholde, howe that for wante of this faythefull zeale, whiche was in this seruaunt of God Dauid: For want of dewe feare &amp; trembling, carefull crying for the spirite of wisedome, and whole attending vppon the Lordes worke, with hartes free from worldlie intanglings: And for want of that intier loue and charitie,1. Cor. 13. which seketh not her owne thinges, but those which are Christes, and her poore brethrens: I say, for want of these things, and being drunken with that new vessell of wine of worldlie concupiscence then set a broche: Can they not espie

howe they haue drawne their liues so farre wrong, that skilfull workemen, yea nowe euery bungler can not but wonder to see suche worke. For they haue framed their timber, some toe longe, and some toe short, in such sort, that the buildinge hangeth all on the one side, tottering and reeling with euerie wind, and waiteth but for a blast from the Lorde to cause it to fall, and to slaie all those, which haue committed thēselues to such a false building. And as for the forme &amp; fashion of the house, where was the paterne which God shewed Moses in the mount?
                  Exo. 26.30. It was to be foūd, but it was not sought, the hast was so great to other things. Therefore because the Lords paterne was refused: no maruaile thowgh hee refused to send his spirit of wisedome vnto those, which stood in stead of Bezaleel,
               
                  Exod. 36.1. and Aholiab, and the rest of the workmen. For veiwe and trie out this reformation. Looke vnto your brethrē of other nations rounde about which haue reformed, if they haue admitted such thinges as you, who yet notwithstanding

                duetie. But looke vnto the worde of God, and espie out there, how manie coales of fire, you haue takē, not from the altar Christ Iesus, but from the smoking chimneis of the Cananites which dwelt in the land, the Papists I meane. Therefore repent and returne, or else take heede of the Lords fire from heauen, who although he vse more patience and longe sufferaunce towardes you, then he did towardes Nadab and Abihu: yet be you assured that he hath not nowe lesse regard and ielousie for the bodie, then he had then for the shadowe.
            And whereas some saye, what? It is a house, though it be a downegate thinge, though it want roufe, though some walles, though it want this and that. Manie such songes the babes in the cradle heare, to rocke thē a sleape. But by their own words I will iudge them. For suppose that some noble man mindeth to builde a house, he hireth workmen and manie seruauntes: part of their wages he paieth, for the

rest hee appointeth dewe order, and make with his workemen streight couenaunt in all thinges, hastening the worke. Since he goeth into an other countrie, and returne fiue and twentie yeeres after: if he then finde his house halfe vnbuilded, and the tymber which is layde, rotten for default of couering in dewe time, and likewise the morter crumbled away, &amp; the stones some fallen and some readie to fall: the workemen they take their wages, and spende it euerie daye at the alehouses and tauernes, eating, drinking, and playing, when they shoulde be at worke: will not that Noble man at his comming cast in prison those workemen and seruauntes, and giue his stewarde also a great rebuke, and put out his house to other workemen? And yet these chief builders of whom I haue spoken, manie of them, yea most of them haue confessed and doo confesse vntill this daye, that manie thinges are amisse in the Church, and yet we must be content and beare thē. And in deede are there manie thinges

wanting and missing to the finishing of the Lordes house, and can they sitt still and eate and drinke, and not buckle them selues to their busines? Or may the Lordes worke aboue other things suffer delaye, and waite oure good leysure? Or are they the Lords remembrauncers, which can giue him rest, and them selues also,
                  Esai. 62.7. before they see Ierusalem, the prayse of ye worlde, redeemed and reedified from the ruin therof? Can they so long time vse the tabernacles of their houses hanged &amp; decked with Arres, and Tapestrie, and fare deliciouslie euerie daye? Can they so long goe to their palet &amp; bedd, and suffer their eyes to slumber and sleepe, before they haue founde out a place for the Scepter of Christe, his lawful gouernement, and made readie a Throne for him to sitte and rule, and treade Antichriste vnder foote? This is counted but a small want. O deepe securitie! This wee must beare: and we are content so to doo, as longe as the Lorde hath made anie promise to beare with wickednes. But he is mercifull,

and long sufferinge: but so, as he will not holde the sinner innocent.
                  Exod. 34.7. And if he spake by his Prophete, saying,
                  Esa. 1.14. that the Sabothes and solemne feastes of the Iewes (which notwithstanding were after his lawe) were a burden vnto him, and hee was wearie to heare them: Howe thinke we is he wearie to beare so manie Sabothes, which hee neuer made, and so manie ceremonies &amp; other deuises &amp; strange Church gouuernement, which neuer entred into his minde: whither are these thinges a burden or no vnto him thinke we? Yea such a burden, that as he hath spoken concerninge them, so hath he concerning vs also: Ah, I will ease me of mine aduersaries. Yea hee must needes skoure our drosse.
                  Esai. 1.24. For in deede our siluer is become drosse, and our wine is mixt with water, farre otherwise thē it was among them. But they saye, wee must beare nowe, for the time is past, when the matters of reforminge the Churches were chieflie handled, and we must tarie vntill a fitte time come agayne.

In deede, there was a time careleslie slipped at the beginninge, when the yron was whote, but the workemen were lasie, and neglected to frame and fashion the work, before the yron was colde. What gracious libertie might not haue bin obteyned, if they, of whō I haue spoken, had bin as carefull and sorowfull for these things, as Nehemiah, who fasted and prayed certayn dayes,
                  Nehem. 2.2 and mourned so much because the Wall of Ierusalem was not yet builded, that the King coulde easelie discerne his sorow by his countenāce, and was moued with compassion, to bidde him aske what hee would haue, before Nehemiah durst mention his sute vnto him. And there is no doubt, but like sorowe and care shoulde haue founde like compassion to haue bin refreshed with, and no lesse furtherance to euerie godlie enterprise. For the Lorde would surelie haue done it, who haue the hartes of Kinges and Princes in his hande. And as wee haue hearde, there wanted not some gracious offer concerning these thinges.

But the Lorde lay not to our charge, that which is past. If occasion offered by him, be not taken, our care, feare, and griefe in repenting, ought to bee the greater, &amp; our indeuour the more behement to recouer our losses. Seeke the Lord then, whyle he may be foūd▪ Labour better then before. Disburden you of al, either offices or liuings, which hange on and presse downe,
                  Heb. 12.1. to hinder you in the worke. Giue glorie to God and his sonne Christ Iesus, by setting vp his royall Throne amonge vs, which is that you call Church gouernement, whiche many thousande tongues haue confessed and complayned to be wanting. Once agayne, remember I saye the Lordes deliuerance, h

               we he saued vs as hee did Israel from Pharao in the redde Sea. Lette vs singe as Moses did at the shoare: He is my God, and I will prepare him a Tabernacle.
                  Exod. 15.2. Therefore are we escaped the drowning, that we should make the Lorde a Tabernacle. Lette vs not onelie promise it in singing or sayinge, but perfourme oure

vowes vnto the Lorde, whiche wee made in the daye of our distresse: and let this Tabernacle be so made, that being viewed in the ende by our Moyses Christe Iesus,
                  Exo. 39.43. the worke and the workemen, may receyue a blessinge. This let vs doe, and goe on, and prosper, and liue in the Lorde: if not, lette vs be sure, the consumption &amp; plague determined, shal ouerspread and ouerwhelme vs by gods righteous iudgement,2. Cor. 10.6 who haue vengeance readie for all disobedience.
            Thus haue I shewed, howe especiallie the Cleargie haue acquite themselues in the day of the Lords visiting of vs, if it had not ben hidden from our eyes.
            And now concerning the rest of the people (I meane those which had som knowledge and zeale) they also haue bene well agreed with their guids in their necligēce. For they hauing once obtained a seruice in the English tongue, thought it so great a matter, that they myght lawfullie be holden excused though they sought no further: and

hauing gotten a shadow, wherein they might coole thē selues in ye heat of the daie, and rest a litle from their wearines: They haue giuen them selues to eating, drinking, and sleaping vnder that shadowe, and forgett the rest of their iournie, vntil darcke night come wherein no man can walke.
                  Iohn. 9.4. Neyther haue they knowne, that as the Lorde gaue to the children of Israel a clowde by day to shadow them from the heat,
                  Exod. 13.21 to this ende, that they should iournie forward to their resting place: So also ye Lord gaue them a defence from that present heate, to the intent that they goinge throughe the vallie of teares,
                  Psal. 84.6. should iournie forward, and goe from strength to strengthe, vntil vnto euery one of them, God had appeared shining out of Sion the perfectiō of bewtie.
                  Psal. 50.2. No, but the people haue bene as a strong asse couching downe betwixt diuers burdens of spirituall bondage.
                  Gene 49.14 And they haue sene that rest is good, and that the lande is pleasaunt, therefore they haue bowed their shoulder to heare, and haue bene subiect vnto that

yoke, which is contrarie to ye libertie,
                  Galat. 5.1. wherein Christ haue sett vs free. Euē so it is certainly. For the pleasures of this world haue stolen away the harts of many, and haue caused zeale and religiousnes to be frosen vp: so true is it that one can not serue both God and Mammon, but eyther he must loue the one and hate the other,
                  Luk. 16.13▪
                or at the least in leaning to the one, he must neclect and despise the other. For the people of England, I meane those which eyther at that time, or since, haue felte some motions of Gods spirit vnto godlines: the most part of them, I say, whiles they haue applied them selues to eate and drinke largely, as in the daies of rest, to buie and selle, and to smile merelie vpon gaine coming in, and to welcome it with giuing it the hand, their hartes haue bene stolen before they haue bene aware: so that they being once deliuered from the filthines of the worlde,2. Pet. 2.20. through the knowledge of the Lord, haue againe intangled them selues therewith, and haue returned as the dogge to his vomit,

&amp; as the sow that is washed, to the walowing in the mire. For vpon this taking a smatch and tast of worldly ease &amp; welth, wherof I spake, the stomach haue become gredie, &amp; there haue ben no ende of seeking gaine, laiyng vp in store, makinge the barnes wider, ioyning house to house,
                  Esai. 5.8. &amp; land to land. So that nowe if one come and tell thē of further seeking the face of God, &amp; building his kingdome: hee speaketh to the bellie which hath none eares, &amp; his speach is like vnto his, which speaketh with a straunge language, and he speaketh to them which fare as if they were in a dreame. For the wine of the fornication of this worlde haue cast them into a sleape, and they haue not knowne, neither will knowe till it be to late to recouer it, that they haue solde their birth right for a mease of potage:
                  Heb. 12.16. And haue not followed the counsell of him which saieth: When thou eatest honie, take heede thou eate not too much,
                  Prou. 25.16 lest it hurt thee. Neyther haue they boughte the precious Pearle of Gods Kingdome:
                  Mat. 13.45. but they

haue solde it for that which glistereth, and yet is no gould.
            But we ought to haue taken heede of all such worldlie things, especially vntill we had further finished our worke and labour in the lorde: herein folowing the example of those men, which deferre their euentide meele, vntill they haue ended their worke, thoughe in such time of the yeare, as part of the night do ouertake them. For their experience doo teach them, that whilest their hande is nowe in woorke, it is not greatly greuous, though they abide some wearines and colde: But when they haue with eating and drinking bene satisfied, and haue basted themselues well by a good fire, then it is death to goe to worke againe: but forthwith the fealing of that ease craueth more, vntil the time of sleape.
            Therefore ought wee to haue holden ease and rest, and worldlie commodities, euen at the swordes point, as enemies to those which fight the Lordes battels, by denying them selues and all things, and taking vp the

crosse, and also as clogges &amp; weightes to them which haue a race to runne, except that they were vsed, as though they were not vsed, and let passe as straungers, not entertayned, and welcomed as beloued friends.
            Yet notwithstandinge this people haue in the middest of their carelesnes, an answere readie as good as an aperne of figge leaues. For say they, we must abyde a time, and the time is not yet come, and they are not ashamed to call it, the Lords leysure, whiche is their owne leysure, seeing the Lorde haue compleined a longe while since, as being wearie of their lasines, saying: Howe long will it be yer this people will goe vp? And concerning not being yet time, the Prophet Agge answereth them: The Lorde of hostes speaketh: thus sayeth this people:
                  Agge. 1.2. The time is not yet come, that the Lordes house should be buylded. Is it time for your selues to dwell in your sieled houses, &amp; this house lieth waste? And with what courage can this people buylde, yea and that gorgeouslie,

siele, hang with clothes, &amp; plant: &amp; se
                  •
                the stones of the Lordes house lyinge stil in the dust? Alas that care is wanting which wee haue mencioned here to be in Dauid, who sware and vowed not to take as it were, the possession of his house, the Arke of God beeing from home.
            That care, zeale, and indeuour is wanting, which was in Nehemiah, &amp; those which were with him, which in ye speedie buylding of the Wall,
                  Nehe. 4.23. did not put off their clothes but onely for wasshinge, vntill the worke was finished, which indeuour the Lord blessed with mightie successe.
            They moreouer in their answering pretende that we must be thankfull to god for that we haue, and charge them with vnthankfulnes, who with griefe and great mourning bewayle that is wāting, and bende vnto it: But what vnthankfulnes was in Hanani, one of the Israelits which came to Nehemiah, and being demaunded concerning the state of the Iewes, he sayde, they were in affliction and great reproche,
                  Nehem. 1.3
               
because the wall of Ierusalem was not buylded vp. Was he vnthankfull to God which had returned their captiuitie, graunted them his true worshippe in their owne lande, with reedifying ye Temple? And was the materiall Wall suche a matter, to complayne of? And what vnthankfulnes was in Nehemiah, to conceyue great griefe therevppon,
                  Nehem. 1.4. and to faste and mourne certayne dayes? It shoulde seeme that they were streight in their owne bowels, when as the Lorde was liberall and bountifull towards them. But they knew, that the full building of Ierusalem was the Lordes prayse, and the honour of his people, and euerie ruine which was to be beholden theare, was to all nations and people which should see it, a witnes of their shame: In as much as it was a monument of the Lords anger, which had dishonoured them, who by their transgressions had dishonoured him.
            And if in those materiall things, &amp; figures, the case standeth so: What reprochfull people are we, and what

blind, dissolute, and miserable men, which see not our reproche and miserie, neyther doo we feele anie burthen thereof, as striuing to be eased of the same. But rather we bost thereof, and glorie in our shame, and say, thankes be to God, we are well, and haue religion reformed better thē manie other countries: And such like smoth speaches and sweet words, which we haue bene taught of diuers of our teachers to heale our deadlie hurt.
                  Iere. 6.14. For that which we want is more then a thousand citie walles: and all the cities in the worlde are not worthe one liuelie church which is Gods Kingdome, wherein the throne of Christ is onlie exalted, and the throne of Antichrist is laide for his footstoole.
            And vntil you see this thing brought to passe, O yee people, and see your selues also the liuing stones of this liuing buildinge: mourne and lament bitterlie. Fast and praye. Bidde farewell to pleasures, and to the daye of mirth. Let ye Bridegrome come out of his chāber, &amp; the bride out of her closet

Weepe vpon your faire seeled houses your inlarged pastures and fieldes, your sweet gardens, pleasant arbours and bowling allis. Know your selues to be in more greeuous bondage of soule, by being holden from Christ his trewe gouernment: then the people of Israel were in bondage of their bodies, when they walking forth by the riuers of Babel,
                  Psal. 137.1. could not be refreshed from their woo, but they sate downe and wept, when they remembred Sion. It was not the pleasant walkinge by the riuers of waters, that could entice them to be merie, and forget their griefe, and forget their countrey, from which they had nowe longe time bene absent. Seuentie yeares coulde not instraunge them, nor weane them frō the remembraunce of Iurie, and Ierusalem, and mount Sion: Not so muche because there was their dwelling, as because they dwelt there togither with the Lorde, giuing there outwarde tokens of his presence. Therefore they vowed, and wished harde thinges vnto them selues,
                  Vers. 6. if they preferred

not Ierusalem before all ioy 
                  〈◊〉
                if they shoulde be ioyfull, before they should see Ierusalēs full deliueraunce.
            Thus shoulde it fare with vs. And euen as a woman which full dearelie haue loued her husbande being nowe deceassed this life, can take no pleasure in beholding his garmentes: but rather renue the remembraunce of her losse, and increase her woo and greefe: So shoulde houses, fieldes, pastures, pleasaunt gardens, orchyards, golde, siluer, yea wife &amp; children, and whatsoeuer else of outwarde thinges: wee should inioie them, &amp; looke vpon them, shasting the head, with wailing and wrinking the hands, crying, alas for our husband Christ Iesus, which haue left vs all these good thinges, and he is not with vs: But our sinnes haue caused him to depart a side, seyng he haue bene so despightfullie vsed amongst vs, by exalting the sworde of his enemie, and treading his sworde vnder foot. And lest any shoulde think me to ouerreach, in saing we are in greuouser bondage then were the

Iewes in Babilon, though to speake of it wil be thought of some, straying from my matter, yet I must regarde edifying more then anie other order. Therfore I demaunde of those which haue anie eyes to see, whither they can beholde their soules to be solde for handefulles of Barlie, and morselles of bread, euen for tithe sheaues (wheras if we had bene solde for slaues, appointed to bodilie toyle, wee might haue helde our peace) For doeth not he which haue monie, or the letter of some great man, or fauoure by other meanes, doeth he not gette the gift of a Benefice of some Patrone, and being presented to the Bishoppe, hee is forthwith sent to be instauled? and so the guydes of our soules, ar appointed vnto vs without our aduice and counsell, whose life and death of soule it standeth vpon to trie our guydes, that after they haue bene founde able to cutt and deuide our portion of ye bread of life in dewe season, they might bee approued of vs, &amp; receyued. But that whiche is more greeuous, when a

blinde leader is come to take vs by the hande, wee haue no authoritie as the Church of God, to refuse him, or to complayne for redresse, or to remoue him, after wee haue tried his inabilitie. Are not then our soules in bondage? Furthermore, we haue no authoritie to complaine of that, or anie other mischiefe, in our owne congregation,1. Cor. 5.4. that by the power of our Lord Iesus, whiche there ought to florishe and beare the swaye, euen in euerie Church of his, that mischiefe might be remedied: but other Lords besides Christ doo rule ouer vs,
                  Esai. 26.13. and ouer the whole Church, yea ouer manie hundred churches: and them we must seek vp through the prouince, thē must wee daunce great attendance, and to them we must complaine: and if our complaint be of anie thinge done against the honour of Christ, or against our libertie which hee haue giuen vs, oure mouth shall be stopped, and we shal be cutt shorter. But if it bee a matter against their owne honour, touchinge their iniunctions, as of the garmēt of

obedience, and the cappe of maintenance, or for takinge downe the imagerie worke about the Fonte, or suche thing, then we are good parishioners, they will visite vs, and redresse those thinges well ynough. Are not nowe our soules in bondage? Furthermore, we can not serue God, or worshippe him publikelie in spirite, as we ought to doo, for wee are tyed to the dead letter, and stinted out our measure, that we must giue God this day, euen as muche, and the selfe same, whiche we gaue him the last daye, that muste we also giue him euerie daye in the yeare, all the time of our lyfe. Whither he be pleased or no, that is his stinte and his fee, hee maye no more haue. And though he be wearie of that and lothed with it, because it is all one disse of meate continuallie, (and that would lothe any mans stomache) yet he must haue it all, and neuer a whit lesse. He is a cruell maister, whiche will vrge his bonde slaue to eate vppe three or foure meases of potage, when his stomache will not beare

one, without regorginge. But the Lorde is worse serued at our handes. And we are forced to mocke the lord: after this manner, in bringinge him such a worshippe, as hee spueth out of his mouth, &amp; that to the endlesse hurte of our owne soules. Are not then oure soules in bondage? Moreouer, if half a dozen, or halfe a skore, doo consent and agree togither, and chuse a man sitte to guyde them: can they bringe him in? or for want of him, or anie other man sufficient, maye they freelie go to another place, to heare the word and receyue the Sacramentes? No, there is a lawe, and by that law, they must come home to their own Parish, there must they feede vpon the rockes and stones, or else starue. Will anie vnmercifull manne deale so with his beaste, as to tye him where there growe not one spire of grasse? And release canne the poore soules haue none, vntill there maye come newe lawes, whiche maye bringe redresse and graunt further libertie, although they neuer come, but still streighter

&amp; streighter. Euen as the Israelites were more hardlie dealt with, after they had motioned their sute of going into the wildernes to sacrifize &amp; worshippe God as he commaunded.
                  Exod. 5.17. Are not then our soules in bondage? That I speake nothing of our subiection to the iurisdiction of that court, which our owne conscience, and the voyce almost of all the people in the lande, crye out that it is popishe and Antichristian, and yet not one man among a thousand haue spirit and courage to withdrawe him selfe from it, neyther will they knowe it to bee a sacriledge, and treason against Christe, to goe and bowe before the scepter of Antichriste: and flatter them selues, saying, that Christ rule in their harts inwardlie, &amp; thei serue him inwardlie, and outwardlie they serue that idoll, which the Deuill haue set vpp, worse farre awaye then the idoll which Nebuchadnessar set vpp in the plaine of Dura.
               
                  Dan. 3.1.
            
            But the people saye, If the Masse and images come againe, they wil rather

dye, then they will receyue those. Will you fight the Lordes battelles, and will you needes chuse your owne standing? Must not the Souldioures fight with that bande and wing of the enemies, wherevnto their Captaine appointe them? But O foolishe and blinde men. For whither is greater wickednes? The Masse and images, or that rule and power, which haue authorised, and established the Masse &amp; images? Whither is greater, the apple, or the tree whiche bringeth forth the apple? For the Masse and images &amp; all other wicked ceremonies, were but apples of this cursed and bitter tree of popishe gouernement. And although we haue cut of a few twigges, which bare some kinde of apples, yet the tree remayne, and the roote hath yet very deepe holde in the grounde, and it bringeth foorth other cursed crabbes, to set our teeth on edge withall. And though the Deuill woulde beare vs in hande, that they were as good apples, and set as great a praise on them, as he did on the apple, which

he feofft Eue with: Yet in eating thereof,
                  Gen. 3. the Lord shall proue our disobedience.
            These abominations which I haue spoken of, &amp; many more which I haue not named, declare whither our bondage, or the Babylonian bondage of the Iewes, were more greuous and daungerous. And if they hanged vp their harpes vpon the willow trees:
                  Psal. 37.2. Whither haue we cause to sett apart Lute &amp; Cithern▪ Uiols, shalmes, Cornets, Sackbuts and Dulcimers, and all the instrumentes of Musicke with daunsing and mirthe: and to singe the songs of dolefulnes? Lette vs rende our harts and not our garments. Lett vs no more sitt downe to eate &amp; drink, and rise againe to plaie: but lett vs eat the bread of aduersitie, and drinke the water of affliction▪ and pray continually so, that in praying, our bitter cō
               plaints may ascende vp to the Lord, &amp; we may rightly speak with like affection, as did the poore banished Iewes saiyng:
                  Psal. 123 Behold▪ as the eyes of the seruants look vnto their masters, and the

eyes of a maidē to the hand of her mistresse: so our eyes wait vpō the Lord our God, vntil he haue mercie vpō vs. Haue mercy vpon vs, O Lord, haue mercie vpon vs, for we haue suffred to much contempt. Yea if we had anie grace to take to hart, the reproches of the papists which mock our patched seruice, and skorne vs, as not able to builde our house of religion, without borowing most of our stones and timber from them: And cast in our tethes: Where doo you tell your church? Or whence haue you any iurisdiction or churche gouernement, but from him whom you skorne in words, namelie the Pope? As in deede it is in euerie mans mouth to cry, fy on the Pope: &amp; yet we bowe the knee before him by submission to his Court. Therefore are we mocked of the papists, as our sinnes haue deserued. Which spirituall euil if our dull harts could feele: we might adde also with those carefull Iewes: Our soule is filled full of the mockings of the welthy &amp; ye despight of ye proud. For it is a time of reproch,

and our shame lyeth open in the eyes of all nations (if we could discerne it) whyles neyther Temple is buylded, wherein we may worshippe the Lord aright, neyther the citie wall, whereby the Heathen might bee kept out, that they no more come into the lords heritage,
                  Psal. 79.1. to defile his holy Temple, &amp; to make Ierusalē an heape of stones. Nowe therefore, although we at the beginning, haue not done as faythfull Dauid did, to sweare and vowe vnto the Lorde, concerning his acceptable work finishing with all possible speed: let vs yet at the length heare the lords voyce,
                  Psal. 95 8. without hardening our hartes, and sweare &amp; vowe to seeke his face, and builde his kingdome otherwise, then we haue done, and not to rest as heretofore, tyll we haue performed our vowes, and passed euen thorough the vallie of teares &amp; mourning,
                  Psal. 84.6. digging fountaynes to quenche our thirste (I meane abyding all trouble and persecution) vntill we draw neare the lords rest in Sion: before the time that hee sweare,
                  Psal. 95.11 and seale the decree of our neuer

entring in thither, and so wee bee shut also from his eternall rest, in his kingdome, for our too much contempt of his glorie, which should appeare in the aduaunced kingdome of his deare Sonne, and for oure luke warme professing his name, without doinge his will, and working his worke.
            Thus haue we hearde concerninge the care, which Dauid had for ye bringing home the Arke. It followeth to speake of the ioy, which he conceyued, when the Lorde vouchsafed to be with him, &amp; to bende also the hartes of the people therevnto, when it was broght home.
            
               I reioyced when they sayde vnto mee, we will goe into the house of the Lorde.
            
            King Dauid according to the vowe and promise which hee made vnto the Lorde, so he continued faythefull and stedfast,1. Chro. 15. and prepared a place for the Arke of God, and pitched for it a tent, and longed for the day, when it should be placed there. Yet for all his faythfulnes

and exceeding great care, it pleased God to humble him, by that great iudgement, whiche fell vppon Vzzah,
               1. Chro. 15. that hee might bee sifted, and tried to the vttermost, and the Lorde spared not Dauid, in that litle thinge which was committed awrye, in that the Arke was caried on a carte, and drawne by Oxen, which ought to haue bene borne vppon the Leuites shoulders.
                  Exo. 25.14 Therefore the Lorde made him to beholde a dolefull sight in the death of Vzzah, and turned his ioye into heauines, for that present time. Thus ielous is the Lorde alwayes for his true worshippe: For he will be sanctified of those,
                  Leui. 10.3. which come neare him. Where is nowe anie place left for toleration of any disorder in the state of the Church? when as the Lord would not tolerate &amp; beare with thus much, for his seruaunt Dauids sake, whose care was so great, whose harte was so faithfull, whose hand was so forward, and his labour so painefull, to restore true religion, &amp; to promote the Lords glorie. But what haue our reformers

of religion done? onely in one thinge haue they followed the example of thē which were with Dauid to help home the Arke the first time: for they to ease their owne shoulders of the burthen, and to auoide that great labour, which belōgeth to ye building of gods church rightlie and effectuallie, haue bene cō
               tent to shuffle vp the matter, and haue committed the cariage of the Arke to brutishe Oxen: euen dumme &amp; blinde Ministers. And these Oxens feete are not shodde with the preparation of the Gospell of peace,
                  Ephe. 6.15. therfore they stūble at euerie steppe, and haue long ago ouerthrown cart, &amp; Arke, &amp; all: althogh there haue bene Vzzahs appointed to put toe their hand &amp; helpe the oxen. I meane teachers haue bin apointed, to learn ye ignorant ministers to preach: how thei prosper, men may wel know, except they had power to work miracles, to make ye dumme to speake, and the blinde to see, and that only by teachinge. But lette those Vzzahs, and the appointers of them vnderstande and knowe a more excellente waye,

namely, that the Leuites take the burthen vpon their shoulders, weighe it neuer so heauie, by trouble, persecution, and paynefull labour, and let them cherefullie bring home that Arke, euē Christ Iesus, vppon whose shoulders the gouernement lieth,
                  Esai. 9.6. and place him in his Tente pitched for him, euen his Sion, his Church and kingdome, that he may beare that rule and gouuernement, which vnto him belōgeth, without so muche as the print of the foule footesteppes of Antichrist, remaining in his Tabernacle to his dishonour.
            And here it shal not be amisse vpon occasion, to touche the courage of Dauid, who although he was a little daū
               ted at the firste, by that miscarying of the Arke, in so much that he said: How shall the Arke of the Lorde come vnto me?2. Sam. 6. yet notwithstanding hee fainted not, neyther gaue ouer his purpose: but feared the Lord more, and sought out more circumspectlie, wher ye fault was, and howe it might be redressed: And agayne girt vpp his loynes, and addressed him selfe with more cherefulnes,

yet agayne to bringe it home. Manie there be in the Realme of Englande, whiche haue bene zealous of Church gouuernement, and of the remouing the ceremonies, of mens traditions, and stinted seruice: and because they haue made long tarying, &amp; haue had a colde offeringe, and haue hoped longe of redresse by Parliamentes, wherevnto they haue made sute, and haue bene disappointed of their hope: Therefore as though they hadde done their whole dewtie, they haue set them downe, and waxed colde and carelesse, and haue slept on both eares, and thinke that the Lord must needes nowe holde them excused, vntill the Lorde cast it vpon them, &amp; put into their mouthes. But they muste knowe, that they are not to ceasse seeking the kingdome of God,
                  Mat. 6.33. and for other thinges they shall be caste vnto them without their carefull thought. The kingdome of God must suffer violence of those,
                  Mat. 11.12. which wt violent zeale doo drawe it vnto them. Many runne, but fewe gett the crowne.1. Cor. 9.24 We must so

runne, as wee may obteyne. It is not ynough to be wishers and woulders, as manie be at this daye counted religious and fauourers of gouernement, because they can saye: O wee muste praye, we must pray: thereby satisfying them selues and others, being not a little gladd, that they may buye it so cheape, to sitt at their ease, and folowe the worlde. Therefore what cryes and complaintes their prayers bee, maye easelie be discerned. Prayers without practtse, are but poore prayers, &amp; the harte whiche setteth not the hande a worke, do not burne with much heate. We must so praye, as continuing and increasing in greater feruēcie, giuing ye Lord no rest, nor suffering any nay: though he seemeth to sende vs awaye with a rough answere, as our Sauior Christe did vnto the Cananitishe woman, refusing her sute, and calling her dogge: yet shee left him not, but desired at the least that whiche a Dogge might haue,
                  Mat. 15.16 euen the crummes which fall from the children, and so obteyned her sute with cōmendatiō of her faith.
            
               And we, if we haue wished &amp; desired, &amp; therwith made sute to the higher powers, &amp; laboured in the behalfe of true Ecclesiasticall gouernement, and yet haue returned emptie, &amp; confounded, because the lord haue not vouchsafed to let vs see ye Arke come home: we are to feare so much ye more before the face of ye lord,
                  Sam. 2.6. as it is said yt Dauid feared the lord, in y• vnspedie day: he feared God before, but now his feare was increased. And in this feare ought we to examine the cause, why the Lord haue not made our enterprise prosperous, &amp; to search our waies, whither we haue taken the right pathe or no: whither we haue gone to the place where it is, or we haue sought it in a wronge place: whither we haue put our shoulders to the burthen, or we haue gone about to carte it, that it might come easily vnto vs, and as it were, alone without oure helping hande. Thus ought wee to search vntil we finde out in our selues the cause of Gods displeasure, for the whiche wee are depriued of this benefite. And hauinge founde the cause, let

vs repent and redresse that is amisse, and strengthen ye feeble knees of ours,
                  Heb. 12.13 making straight steppes to our feete, least that which is halting, bee turned out of the waye. Lette vs recouer the right pathe, from the which wee haue wandred wide, and gyrde vppe oure loines, that wee maye with more courage and swiftnes walke therin, then before we haue done in our wronge &amp; false waye.
            And some there be whiche haue atteyned vnto this knoweledge, that the kingdome of God come not by obseruation,
                  Luk. 17.20. and wayting and suinge, here and there, but is neare vnto vs, euen within vs: and no more is to be required, but that we remoue our selues frō euill, and worshippe God accordinge to his worde, chusing rather to suffer the crosse, then to denye Christ by slauishe giuing ouer of that authoritie &amp; libertie, which he haue giuen vnto his people. Some I saye, haue attayned vnto this knowledge, yet notwithstanding they haue bene dismayed and offended, beholding the wayward footsteppes

of diuers whiche haue gone before, euen in the right path, though not with steadie foote, but haue slipped, halted, and falne in the waye by committing some thinge whiche haue displeased the Lorde, as sometime in the chiefe Citie in Englande, there were manie whiche withdrewe themselues from this spirituall bondage mentioned. But some onelie making conscience at the Cappe &amp; Surplesse, and therein stoode all their religion. Some entring that waye, despised all other, but pitied them not in the bowelles of compassion, that they might be brought vnto the trueth, but were proude in their owne conceyte. Moste of them also ignoraunt howe they should come to the ende, or yet to the middest of the waye, which they hadd entred, neyther being humble in seeking out the same, but thinking rather that they knew all things. Therfore whē they wer tried and weighed, manie were found too light, and their miscarying of the Lords Arke, and the iudgement which fell vpō some of

thē, as sore as did vpō 
               Vzzah, discouraged manie, &amp; weakned their hands. So by their vntowardnes they caused the sauour of the Lords work to stink in the nostrels of the people.
            And of late an other attempt haue bene giuen that waie by one, of whom I must needs saie, that the Lord vsed him as a meanes to bringe the trueth to light, in manie points concerning the true gouernement of the Churche: who, I wish for the glorie of God, if it had ben his good pleasure, that he had stoode in integrity, without swaruing and leaninge to Antichristian pride, and bitternes. And for me to make mention thereof, may seme very hard, which am not so able therin to saue my self frō the reproch of manie tongues, as I am to cleare my selfe of the deseruing the same. Yet notwithstanding a wound being made in the brethrens minds: I haue thought it my duetie rather to labour to heale it, thē to faine my selfe not to see it.
            
               
                  Mat. 24.12.True it is at all times, that iniquitie preuailinge, causethe the loue of

manie to abate. For euerie iniquitie committed especiallie in those enterprises, which beare the cheefest shewe of holines before the Lord, and draw nearest his work, procure a more greuous and speedie iudgement, to cause a lamentable successe therein. For as I haue alledged: The ieleous God will be sanctified of those which come neare him,
                  Leuit. 10.3. and he cause his iudgment to beginne euen at his owne house.1. Pe. 4.17. This iudgment being beholden, causeth feare, and daunteth the courage of many which had begonne to steppe in the waie. Euen as if two men riding through a water, the former slipp into some groope and perish, the other had rather turne backe, and loose his iournie, then to goe forward, though there be space enough to goe by, and auoyd that daunger. At the least with feare and trembling hee seeketh out his waie. And no maruell it is though the beholding of such iudgement, because of iniquitie preuailinge, cooleth greatlye the heat of loue, and dulleth the edge of courage for a time.

For euen valiant Iosua thereby was striken full sore.
                  Iosua. 7. For he rent his clothes and fell to the earth, at the euill suc
                  •
               esse in the battle at Ay. And he cried: Alas O Lord God, wherefore hast thou broughte this people ouer Iorden, to deliuer vs into the hands of the Amorits, &amp; to destroie vs? Would God we had bene content to dwell on the other side Iorden. Oh Lord, what shall I saie, when Israel turne their backes before their enemies? Thus he seemed to repent his coming ouer Iorden, As though that iournie had not bene taken in hande in the Lorde, and by him furthered, and the furtheraunce thereof confirmed and honoured by a great miracle of the Lords mightie hand. But the Lorde raised him vp, and tolde him that iniquitie committed in Israel, had caused the reproche of that vnspeedie daie. Also Aaron, Eleazar, and Ithamar were so daseled with the iudgement,
                  Leui. 10.19 which fell on Nadab and Abihu, that they did not eate the Goat in the holie place, as they shoulde haue done.

               Moses was so greued at the euill successe of the children of Israel, not being able to come to their rest because of their iniquitie, that he chose rather to be rased out of the booke of life, then to heare and see that reproche,
                  Exo. 32.31. which shoulde come vnto that people, and to the name of God. Ieremiah wished that he had neuer bene borne, because Israel in steade of a blessing, had rewarded euill vnto their owne soules. Rebekah when the children stroue in her wombe,
                  Gen. 25.22 thought it had bene better not to haue conceyued. And Dauid when he sawe the deathe of Vzzah, brought not home the Arke at that time, but feared and lamented, saying: Howe shall the Arke of God come vnto mee? Great feare came on the church of Ierusalem, at the terrible iudgement of Ananias and Saphira.
               
                  Act. 5. Most of these haue bene partly afraide and discouraged, as though their interprise and work, which was of the Lorde, had in it selfe obtayned that harde happe, and vnprosperous euent, which proceeded of some other

euill comming in by the waye. But as Iosua, when he had founde out the faulte, and purged it, renewed battell agayne, and sawe the mightie power, and great saluation of the Lorde for them, with comfort and gladnes: and as Dauid when he also had espied the faulte and redressed it, renewed his indeuour, and brought home the Arke with more ioye and chearefulnes: and as the Disciples of Ierusalem ceassed not from giuing almes, but their feare tended to this, that they shoulde do it with more singlenes of hart: So let not vs be offended, and stumble at the sinne of anie man, to giue ouer our zeale and loue vnto the Lordes cause, ye trueth whereof his worde hath cōfirmed vnto vs. But rather let vs search out, where the iniquitie is, and let the offender beare his shame and rebuke, howe excellent a personage soeuer he haue bene, for turninge the trueth of God into a lye: and let the Lord haue his glorie, who is alwayes founde true,
                  Rom. 3.7. when euerie manne is founde a

liar. And his trueth abounde the more, through the lie of man vnto his glorie.
            The children of Israel which came out of Egypt to goe into the lande of Canaan, coulde not atteyne thither, but their carkases fell in the wildernesse: Might one haue saide therefore, that they came not out by the Lords commaundement and his conduct? Yes, and greater was the glorie of GOD, who was not hindered from performinge his promise by the vnbeleefe of that people: but their vnbeleefe made his faithefulnes more appeare. And their vnrighteousnes commended the Lordes righteousenesse,
                  Rom. 3.5. whiche recompensed them their iust deserte, and yet raysed vppe a better generation, to enter into his resting place. So will the Lorde euermore make his cause to stande, though they whiche handle it amisse, shall fall before it in the waye. And as for men of greate credit and estimation, the Lorde often times will make theyr

weakenesse and vanitie to appeare, that no glorie might bee transferred from him self to mortall men, and that we should neuer make fleshe and bloud our arme, neyther trust in manne, in whose nostrels is breath:
                  Esa. 2.22. for what is he to be esteemed? Salomon the glorie of the Kings of the earth, called also the Lordes beloued,2. Sā. 12.25 a spectacle for wisedome: whom the Lorde vsed also for a speciall instrument vnto manie thinges: yet did not hee perseuere in wisedome, but became a foole in committing wickednes against the Lord.1. Kin. 11.6. 
               Iehu, whiche valiauntlie wrought the Lordes worke at the first,2. kin. 10.31 turned also to idolatrie, and forsooke the Lorde. And Gedeon,
               
                  Iud. 8.27. a worthie instrument, which the Lorde chose for his worke, made the Ephod, which was an instrument of euill.
            These and manie more examples there be, which teach vs, that althogh we see before our eyes neuer so manie which begin in the spirite, and ende in the fleshe, that we condemne not their beginning, neyther feare to enter into

that waye, but rather take heede that we walke so fast, and so steadelie, and so well armed, that sinne doo not ouertake vs, &amp; ouerthrowe vs in the waye. The euill example of life shewed by those Nations which are called Christian this daye, make the sauour of the Gospell to stinke before the Iewes, Turkes, and other Heathen, which refuse therefore once to searche, what Christian religion is. Therefore are they still holden backe from Christe &amp; his kingdome. Like recompence shall we reape, if the vntowarde example of anie man quensh our zeale and care of searchinge out the Lordes cause, that we shoulde not take it in hande.
            But there are not wanting, whiche vnto the slowe rūners about the lords busines, laye more weight of lead vppon their feete, and bringe them into a further securitie, by afraying them, by the example of Vzzah, that they attempt not anie thinge about matters pertayninge to the Churche, because they haue no callinge. As though that vengeance shewed vppon Uzzah, was

for taking vpon him a wrong calling▪ and not rather for dooing that whiche was no mans calling to do. For there was no man in Israel whiche had anie such calling, but if that hee had driuen the Cart and done as Vzzah did, it is like hee shoulde haue bene spared as litle as Vzzah was. And Dauid in the 13. verse of the 15. of the firste Chron. speaking to Sadock and Abiathar, say not, the Lorde haue made this breache amonge vs, because Vzzah did euill: But because we (sayth he) sought him not in, dewe order. And although hee saye also, because you were not heare: his meaning is not that they being present, should haue done that which Vzzah did.
            But admitte he was punished for ouerreaching his calling: (as in deede whosoeuer passe the boundes of dutie, passe the boundes of their calling also in that respecte) Is it not the callinge of euerie Christian, to remoue himselfe from their communion, whiche worshippe God vaynlie, as by the directinge of the blinde and dumme ministerie,

that execrable abominatiō in Gods sight: and to ioyne onlie, where the Lordes worshippe is free, and not bound or witholdē wt the bands of any iurisdiction of this worlde. Howe can they make the kingdome of God near vs &amp; within vs,
                  Luk. 17.20. if we can not by gods assistance, make our selues members of his outward church &amp; kingdome in this worlde, which onely hath the promise of blessing and life for euermore:
                  Psal. 133.3. without the authoritie of man, &amp; wayting their leysure, for a cōmaundemēt therevnto. And whervnto are all christians made kings &amp; priestes?
                  Reue. 1.6. Haue they no calling therby to seeke ye meanes of their saluation? If my saluation shoulde depende vpon the curtesie of anie in this worlde, I were in most miserable takinge. But the righteousnes of God dealeth other wise: and our saluation dependeth vppon that king, whose baner is alwayes displaied before vs,
                  Mat. 28.20 and he is with vs to the ende of the worlde.
            But now cōcerning those which are able to teache &amp; instructe in the way of

the Lord, they must not meddle without calling (saye they) although there be no callinge suffered and allowed of in a Realme or Dominion, but that which they confesse to bee vtterlie vnlawfull. So must the flocke of Christe tarie and be starued, whilest we wayte for that, which they can not direct vs where to haue, or howe it should be. It must be, saye they, by diuers true Ministers calling and allowing him: and so he must be ordeyned. But howe manie of the Ministers in the Realme of England dare be seene in this dooing? If fayth canne not bee begotten without a Preacher, and a Preacher can not be without lawfull sendinge: and this be the onelie way:
                  Rom. 10.13 why suffer they the people to be depriued? Why are they afrayde and ashamed of the Gospell of Christe? Why rather doo they not abide persecution? But the lawfull calling and sending of the Ministers, whiche is the onelie meane to make them haue frutefull wombes to begette faythfull children, and fruteful brestes to nource the same: also dewe

gouuernement, which is the onelie aduauncing of Christe his kingdome, &amp; the cutting short of sinne and wickednes: Also oure Christian libertie to worshippe God with free conscience, according to his worde: and our comfortable ioyning in the true felowship and communion of Saintes: And to conclude, the meanes of our saluation must be kept from vs, vntill a ciuile law send them vnto vs, although there be neuer so long delay: as though they were not sent from heauen, and offred to all that will receyue them. We can defie the Papistes doctrine, for making part of our saluation, to hange vppon oure owne desertes: but wee canne not taste the bitternes of the roote of this doctrine, that the building of gods kingdome, for the meane and furtherance of our saluation must depend vpon ciuile power, and Christ Iesus with all things pertayning vnto him, are made vnderlings therevnto, and caused to daunce attendaunce vpon it. Those which walke after this doctrine and teache men so, doo break

not one of ye least, but one of the greatest commaundements, teaching men so: and therefore shall be counted least in the kingdome of God, if they doe not repent.
            And agayne, concerning this calling, whiche must needes bee done by diuers Ministers which will not doo it: But admit they would, frō whence haue they their calling, sendinge, and authoritie, such as pertaineth to a Minister? Hadde they it not from those which sitt in the chayre of Antichrist? Yea, howe manie are in all Christendome, which haue bene so rightlie ordeyned, but that their ordination haue come from the popishe Prelacie, with in three or foure generations at the most? Nowe if a man take a griffe of a sowre frute, and plant it, &amp; then take a griffe of that newe planted, &amp; plant that: and take of that agayne &amp; plant it the thirde time, and so continewe vnto the hundreth time: will it loose the sowrenes, and gather sweetnesse? No more can an vnlawefull callinge bring foorth a lawfull, though it descende

from one to another an hundred or a thousande times. Therefore except they can approue the lawfulnesse of their calling to the ministerie vnder some other title then yt which thei now haue by ye Clergie: it will fall out, that there shal hardlie be found a Minister duelie called in all the worlde, and also that there is small hope that euer ther shalbe anie. But whatsoeuer burthen they laye vpon vs, I laie no more vpon them, but that they hauinge the approuing and consent of their flocke, doo the works of a Minister, namely, that they feede their flocke wherof the holy ghost haue made them ouerseers, if they make not them selues vnworthie, and that they keepe backe from them, nothing that is profitable.
                  Act. 20.
                     ••
                  
                  ▪
                So then they muste not keepe backe nor suffer to be kept backe (they standing still) their libertie &amp; authoritie, which the Churche should haue, and the true worshippe of God in all pointes safe and sounde, the scepter of the gouernement of Christ borne vpright, and hauing dewe honour, remouing themselues

and their flockes, at least from all open abomination in life and religion, whereby reproch should redowne to the name of God. These thinges if they doo, and whatsoeuer else appertaineth to a ministers duetie: their worke shall commende them, and testifie their calling, and shall be in stead of an Epistle or rather a licence written in their owne harts:2. Cor. 3.2. vndestood also and redd of all men. Our Sauiour Christ being demaunded whither he were the sent Sauiour, or they should looke for an other: did not answere that he was sent a Sauiour,
                  Mat. 11.3. but saide: Tell Ihon what you haue herde and sene: The blinde see, the lame walke, the lepers are clensed, the deafe heare, the dead are raised vp, and the poore receyue the Gospell. As if he shoulde haue saide: I doo the workes of the Sauiour, which the Prophetes beare witnes of, that he should doo: Therefore I am the sent Sauiour. As namelie Isaiah witnesseth, saiyng: He hath sent me that I shoulde preach the Gospell to the poore,
                  Esai. 61.1. and that I should

heale the broken harted &amp;c. And our Sauiour Christ witnessethe in an other place, saiynge: I haue greater witnes then the witnes of Ihon:
                  Iohn 5.36. For the workes which the Father hathe giuen me to doo, those testifie of me, that the Father haue sent me. Therefore whosoeuer doo the worke of Ministers, and haue not known the deepnes of Satan, neyther haue the cursed learning of Antichrist: I iudge none other burthen to be putt vpon them,
                  Reuel. 2.24. but that they holde fast the doctrine of Christ vntill his comming: And their worke shall declare their calling, and seale it before all men. Otherwise the answere of our Sauioure Christe to them which came from Ihon, and the proofe of his calling should not be forceable.
            And moreouer, whereas they tie the Ordination of euerie Minister, as it were, vnto the girdle of other Ministers, that of necessitie it must at all times depende and staie vppon them: that is to laie a greater bondage vpon ye churches, thē they are able to beare.

For admitt there be onelie one church in a nation, and they want a pastour: must they seeke ouer Sea and lande, to gett a minister ordained by other ministers? But what if there shoulde be but only one apparent to vs in the world: shall that church for euer be depriued, after they haue once wanted a minister, for default of authoritie to call and ordaine an other? By this reason, euery church should not be perfect in it selfe, nor haue in it selfe meanes and power to continue by that measure of lines which the Lord haue measured out vnto it. And is it not a dishonour to Christ Iesus the head of euery congregation, which is his bodie: to say that his body together with the heade, is not able to be sustained and preserued in it selfe?
            Moreouer I demaund what calling the dispersed disciples of the churche of Ierusalem had, yt they did preache and teach the Gospell as they went? Were they all ordained ministers, by whose meanes it is said that manie did beleue,
                  Act. 11.21. and that the Lorde was

with them? And those whom they did 
                  •
               egette, and bring forth as new borne children to God through the Gospell of his sonne: did they want authoritie to feede them and giue them sucke being so brought forth? Which if they might doo, then came they very neere to the work of the pastour, which hath his name of feeding. And was not only charitie a calling to these men, who meeting with such as they found worthie, ouerslipped not that occasion of doing so great good? If the Samaritan be commended for doing the part of a neyghbour vnto him which fell among theeues and was woūded:
                  Luke 10.36 because he hadd compassion on him, tooke him vp, and washed his woundes, and in all thinges prouided for the safetie of his life: Why should they be reproued as passing the bounds of their calling, who meeting with soules wounded by the sworde of Antichristian robbers, or anie waie bound by Satan with the chaines of ignoraunce: shall helpe to loose them, and mollifie their woundes with the oile

of Gods trueth, and bestow vpon them what spirituall gifte they are able, to refresh them, and saue the life of their soules? Yea if they doo it not, they shalbe founde mercilesse, and like to fayle of mercie in the time of their neede.
            In all this I denie not but that ther is vse of other Ministers, when they may be had, for mutuall help in trying and examining, &amp; alowinge those whō they finde meete, that by their iudgement the other churches may so much the more be confirmed.
            Thus haue I passed the bounds of the texte somewhat in this discourse, I confesse. But I craue pardon of ye reader. For not without due occasiō haue I bin ledde therevnto. And nowe at length I come to speake of Dauids ioye, whiche I thought to haue done long yere nowe.
            And firste of all, therein wee espie the footesteps of that fayth whereby the authour to the Hebrewes witnesseth,

so manie excellent practises 
                  •
               o haue bene atchieued: which is the grounde of thinges which are hoped for,
                  Heb. 11. and the euidence of things whiche are not seene. For hereby Dauid despised all the glorious thinges with visible shewe, whiche belonged to his Royall kingdome, and did bidde them giue place, in comparison of the vnspeakeable treasure of Gods fauour, and all the good whiche flowe from thence, whiche he sawe not but by the eyes of fayth, and possessed onely by the title of that euidence, whiche is concerninge thinges not seene but hoped for, yet herein hee ioyed fullie. The multitude saye:
                  Psal 4.6. Who will cause vs to see good? They knowe what they see here, but they knowe not what they shall haue. But the faythefull saye: Lorde lift vp the light of thy countenaunce vppon vs, and so thou shalt giue vs more ioye of harte, then the people haue of their aboundant haruest and vinetage.
                  Ver. 7. They knowe not, or at ye least wil not acknowledge

for their owne ye things of this world But those thinges which out of Gods countenance turned towardes them, they do conceyue, they knowe for their owne, and they declare that they seeke an induring citie.
            So then euen as Dauid by faith had ouerquelled the Lion and the Beare, and by fayth had enterprised to fight with Goliah, and had preuayled: so by fayth hee obteyned the bringinge home of the Arke. And though he seemed at the firste to be disappointed, &amp; walked on his waye weeping, sowing deare seede (as did Abraham when he so long went without an heyre,
                  Psal. 126.6. and at last was commaunded (as it were) to burie ye hope which hee had of the promise in his onlie heyre, by appointing him vnto the death): Yet as Abraham did,
                  Rom. 4.18. so hee beleeued in hope against hope. Therefore in the Lords appointed day, hee returneth with mirth and gladnesse, bringing his sheaues with him, when as by fayth hee had gotten accesse vnto ye grace wherin he stoode,
                  Rom. 5.2. and reioiced vnder the hope of the glorie

of God, wherein hee sawe a liuelie image in his holie Arke, with an vndoubted pledge of loue and fauour towardes him. Thus hee fayleth not of that wherewith hee strengthened his soule in the time of weaknes &amp; temptation, sayinge: Why art thou caste down, O my soule, and why art thou so disquieted within me!
                  Psal. 42.11. wayt on god for I shall yet see the time to giue him thankes for the helpe of his presence. He is my present helpe, and my God. Thus he wayted with patiēce, which taught him experience, which experience brought forth the increase of his hope,
                  Rom. 5.4. and his hope made him not ashamed: seeing hee was not disappointed of that he hoped for, but sawe the greater saluation of the Lorde in the daye of his reioycing, to the further sustayning of his hope, to wayte for greater things also at the Lordes hande. So we see that which I haue spoken, that by faith he entred into the Lords rest, when as the Lorde vouchsafed to haue his resting place and holy habitation with him, and by fayth he reioysed in

this, esteeming it aboue all other causes of ioye, because he looked to those inuisibe ioyes, whiche hereby were promised and sealed vnto him.
            And nowe to applie this vnto our selues. This also is a glasse which we haue not dressed our selues by: for verie manie can saye, Waite, and tarie. But whither doo we thinke, that they meane, vntill the Lorde helpe and further their paynefull indeuour, whiche is neuer a whit, or vntill they haue filled their insatiable and bottomlesse Coffers with vncontrouled traphiking? For, where is the disquiet and casting downe of the Soule? Where are the afflictions whiche the Lorde shoulde remember, as he did Dauids? Which shoulde whett the edge of patience, that patience might haue her perfect worke,
                  Iames 1.4. that they might be intire wanting nothing. But aboue all thinges, where is faith, without the which it is impossible to please God? And without the whiche God will not shewe his glorie before anie people, to their saluation, but to their confusion?

for want of which, our Sauior Christ wrought not those miracles in some places, whiche otherwise hee woulde haue done? Where is this faith, I saye, when those which are the chiefe and principall leaders of the people, which shoulde beare the Arke vppon their shoulders: they saye, and haue taught the people to say, It is not possible it should come home: and why? For not only the chiefe of the Clergie, but also the chief which haue ye reynes of the ciuile regiment, are against the establishing of church gouernement. I demaund, whither it be from heauē, or from men. If frō heauen: with god all things are possible, &amp; hee will then further his cause in our hand, when we beleeue. And when it shall please the Lorde to further his cause:
                  Rom. 9.19. who can resist his will? For thē euerie Ualley shall be exalted, and euerie Hill shall be brought lowe, for the loftines of menne shall be abased, and the Lorde GOD onelie shall bee exalted in that daye.
                  Esai. 2. The roughe waye shall bee made playne. This will the ielousie

of the Lord of hostes performe, &amp; his owne arme shal susteine him to do the worke if we could beleeue: yet we say it can not bee. Where is that fayth, whereby our Fathers subdued kingdomes,
                  Heb. 11.34 wrought righteousnes, obtayned the promises, stopped ye mouthes of Lions, quenched the violence of the fire, escaped the edge of the sworde, of weake were made strong, waxed valiaunt in battaill, turned to flighte the armies of the aliauntes? Let vs feare for the greeuous iudgement of God, which befell to the children of Israell in the wildernes, whiche were readie to haue entred into the Lordes rest: but sodainlie thorough vnbeleefe conceyued of the euill tidinges which the spies brought,
                  Deut. 1.28. they did shutt the dore against them selues. And what was the matter? The walles were so high, and the people were so stronge. But the height and strength of the Lordes arme was forgotten, whiche had bene stretched out vpon Pharao and Egypt vnto destruction: But vpon them vnto deliuerance. Euen so wee, for wee

woulde fayne enter into the Lordes Sion, a true reformed Churche: but some body is against it. I knowe whereof you meane. A Lyon is in the waye: but Salomon saye, that that is but the excuse of a

               uggarde.
                  Prou. 22.13 Those spies were euill ynough, whiche went into Canaan, and brought home an euill answere. But what shall we saye to those spies whiche tell an euill answere before they will steppe one foot out of the doore? We haue high walls against vs also, and strong Prelates, whose bodyes if they were growne as farre out of square, as their pompe &amp; authoritie is growne from the lines of their calling, they shuld not be like the Anakims in Canaan: but rather like vnto the Giaunt, which the Poets haue fayned, to haue stoode but vpp to the knees in the Sea, where it is at ye deepest. But for a meane to plucke downe this height, and weaken this strength, the hande of the Lord is forgotten, which was stretched out, euen within this generation, vpon the high walles and swelling Babilonishe buildings

of the Abbies and Monasteries. Euen when there was no hope or likelihoode of any such thing by mans reason: Then came a daie from the Lorde, vppon euerie high tower, and vppon euerie stronge wall,
                  Esa. 2.15. to make those places voide dennes. For thistles and nettles growe in their highe halles, and priuie chambers, and the owles shrike there, and the crowes &amp; the rauens gaile there by Gods iust iudgement. There came a daie also vppon all their pleasant pictures, and all their galaunt images, whereof they were gladd to cast some into hooles to the moules and the backes, to keepe them from the fire.
                  Ver. 20. The daie of the Lorde came also vpon the Cedars of Lebanon,
                  Ver. 13. &amp; the Okes of Bashan, euen the great &amp; mightie Cardinals, Abbots, Monkes and Friars, and the rest of the Prelats, whiche bare the sway in the land. These wanted not strengthe. For they were like horses prepared to battle, they were cladd with iron habargions,
                  Reuel. 9.7. they had Lions teeth. They had also crownes

on their heads, and stinges in their tailes. For there was not one of them in whose presence to speake any thing against their idolatrie: but that it was as muche, as a mans life was worth. These also haue the breathe of the Lords mouthe sent into the bottomlesse smoking Lake, from whence they came. These thinges haue the Lord done for vs, euen in our fresh remembrance, to beat downe the hilles, and make the waie smother to the residue of our iournie. He hath opened a wide dore vnto vs: But we being drū
               cken with the ease of this world, haue reeled against the posts thereof, &amp; fallen backwarde and lie sleaping. Let vs take heede lest we sleape so longe, vntill the Lorde shutte the dore, and naile it vppe also with an othe in his anger, if he haue not done it already.
            Seing then ye Lord haue giuen such an onset, doing so great things for vs, bringing vs thus farr on our way out of Egypt: let vs take heed there be not in vs an euill harte and vnfaythefull to departe from the liuinge GOD,
                  Heb. 3.12.
               
least we be depriued. But let vs go on our way cherefullie: and feare not the heate of the daye, nor the darkenes of the night.
                  Esa. 4.5. For the Lorde shall create vpon euerie place of mount Sion, and vpon the assemblies thereof, a cloude and smoke by daye, and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for vppon all the glorie shall be a defence, and a couering shall be for a shadowe in the daye for the heate, and a place of refuge and couert for the storme and for the rayne. Neither let vs feare for the highe walles of Iericho, I meane the Antichristian Canon lawe, whiche is the strength of his gouernement. For by fayth ye walles of Iericho fell down at the blastes of the Trumpettes.
                  Heb. 11.30 And what are al the execrable buildings of Antichrist, which still remayne amongest vs, that they should stande before the Lords Trumpetters, if they haue fayth, and doo not onely blowe their blastes, but also compasse the Citie as ofte as they shoulde, and blowe their blastes in due time and place, as the Lorde haue appoynted? Moreouer, let

vs knowe, that as the walles of Iericho fell downe, so also by fayth the walles of Ierusalem were builded vp. For Nehemiah misdoubted not eyther the fewnes, either the pouertie of the Iewes, eyther the malice of the enemies, but stept vnto the woorke in the middest of those vnlikelihoods, for the whiche their aduersaries did mocke them drylie, saying: What doo these weake Iewes,

            So therfore when the harte of gods people shall be to worke, encouraged by fayth, so that their handes also bee strengthened, and put to the busines, though neuer so manie Ammonites &amp; Ashdodims be wroth and conspire al togither to come against Ierusalem,
               
                  Nehe. 4.7. &amp; to hinder the building thereof, yet shal God bringe their counsell to nought. For God is in the middest of it:

shall it not be moued: God shall helpe it very earlie. Thoughe the nations rage against it, &amp; the kingdoms be moued: God shall vtter his voyce, and the earthe shall melt: God shall speake vnto them in his wrath,

But our armes will he strengthen, so that they shall breake euen a bowe of steele.

For God is faithefull, who hath promised, saying: To him that disposeth his waie aright,

            Againe concerning Dauids reioysing, in the day when the people assembled willingly to accompanie him at the bringinge home of the Arke, and the Lorde made all thinges to prosper: It semed to be the fullest &amp; soundest ioye that euer he hadd, bothe for that he then daunced, and leaped,

and sprange as one rauished, and fullie possessed with an heauenlie pleasure, and also taketh refreshement, as it appeareth in this psalme, in remēbring, meditating, and singing of the happines of that time, whiche teacheth vs what affection wee shoulde put on in matters pertaining to the Lords glorie, as when his kingdome is builded, and furthered, when he is well known amongest vs,
                  Psal. 76. and his Name is great as in Israel, &amp; his Tabernacle with vs as in Salem, and his dwellinge as in Sion.
            
            We reade of Dauid, that when the Lorde had giuen him to see his sonne Salomon placed in the throne of the kingdome,1. King. 1. he worshipped vppon the bedde, and saide: Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who hath made one to sitte on my Throne this daye, euen in my sight.
            This also was a godly reioysing, as it is a godlie and commendable thing in all Kinges &amp; Princes, to haue care to see that matter so well ordered and disposed in the time of their life, as

much as in them lie, that the people whose safetie the Lorde haue committed to their care and charge, maye enioye continuance of peace and welfare after their deceasse,
                  Psal. 144. that ther bee no inuasion, nor going out, nor crying in the streetes of their dominions afterward: As also it is godly and commendable to ioie, and blesse God whē he giue them to see with their eyes, the hope of a good staie within their kingdoms: which is so farre from derogating from their honour and renowne, that it tendeth greatlie to the increase &amp; aduancement of the same. For Dauid tooke this for an honorable salutation at his seruaunts hands, when they saide:1. Kin. 1.47 God make the name of Salomon more famous then thy name, and exalt his Throne aboue thy throne. This I say, was one ioye of Dauids, yet not comparable to the other: as appeared in that his care to beholde this thinge was not so vehement, and he was neere to haue ouerslipped too longe, the laying of his hande to the furtheraunce thereof, in

respect of Adoniahs ouer hastie attempt, and he had neede of stirringe vp by the sute of Bethsaba, and the aduertisement of Nathan the Prophet. Whereas in the other busines of bringing home the Lords Arke, he neded no spurres to pricke him on forward. Flesh &amp; bloode kindled not that zeale in him, but the Lorde hadd inflamed his harte with the Spirit of loue and fire. And this burninge affection of loue bare he from time to time, vnto the Lords holy Tabernacle, for his trew worshipps sake, and his glorie therein appearing. And as it was his life to dwell in the Courts of the Lord by often frequenting them: so was it euen death and great distresse for him to be a straunger from the same, as appeareth by his pitifull complaints in the daies of his banishments, as when he sayeth:
                  Psal. 42.2 As the Hart braieth for the Riuers of water: so panteth my soule after thee O God. My soule thirsteth for God, euen for the liuinge God. When shall I come and appeare before the presence of God?

His teares were his meate daye and night, and hee powred out his verie harte when hee remembred the deare times past, when he had gone with the multitude, and led them into the house of God with the voyce of singing and prayse, as a multitude that keepeth a feast. But we alas declare what poore and feeble ioye we would conceyue, if the Lorde would restore the glorie of his sonnes kingdome in open sight before our face, and purge his Court and Sanctuarie, &amp; plant vs therein, when as wee being berefte of this benefite, haue so small thirst, so little panting &amp; braying, and so little sadnes of soule, and shedding of teares, for this maner presence of the Lorde.
            Yea wee heare the voyces of manie, and the thoughtes of more lie open before the Lorde, whereof some saye, and some thinke, that they haue no great neede of Christ his Ecclesiasticall gouuernement, seeing they can gouerne them selues, and liue in the feare of the Lord wel ynough, as they imagine with them selues. Therefore

they sett their harts at rest. But haue they more staye of them selues, and towardnes vnto Godlines thē 
               Dauid had? Or doo they thinke, that he was cleane absent from God, that he could not praie and prayse his name? Yet doo hee saie: When shall I come to appeare before the presence of God? And skarce could he comfort his own soule, whiche was then in heauines, though he hoped for a day of returne. Thus he accounted, that he shoulde stande before the presence of God, when he should be present in the place, which the Lorde did chuse to putt his name theare, and shoulde enioye the sight of those things, which the Lorde appointed for the tokens of his presence amonge them. And therein was his great delight, according as he vttereth,
                  Psal. 84. saying: O Lord of hostes, how amiable ar thy tabernacles? My soule longeth, yea and fainteth for the courtes of the Lorde. For mine hart and my fleshe reioyse in the liuing God. Blessed are they that dwell in thine house: they will euer prayse thee.

And although hee behaued him selfe carefullie before God, when hee was absent from the Lords tabernacle: yet he acknowledged his strength not to be so great, but that there was daūger to be feared by the want of those thinges which the Lord had appointed as meanes to holde them in his true worshippe. For this cause he complaineth vnto Saul his persecutor, not so much for persecutinge him, as for chasinge him from the place where the Lorde vouchsafed to dwell. For he saith: If ye Lord haue stirred thee vp against me,1. Sā. 26.19. let him smel ye sauour of a sacrifice: but if the childrē of men haue done it, cursed be they before the Lord: For they haue cast me out this day frō abyding in the inheritance of the Lord, saying, Goe serue other gods.
            This loue to Gods house, hadde Kinge Ezekiah,
               2. Kin. 2.20 who in his sicknes (whereof woorde was brought him that hee shoulde dye) was greeued for nothinge so muche as this, that hee shoulde no more goe vppe into the Lordes house.
            
               For this cause were his prayers and teares. As appeareth by the worde which came from the Lorde by the mouth of the Prophete. Thus sayeth the Lorde God of Dauid thy Father, I haue hearde thy prayer, and seene thy teares. I haue healed thee, and the thirde day thou shalt g
                  •
               e vp vnto the house of the Lorde.
            This zeale also &amp; loue to the Lords house appeared in the ancient fathers which returned from the captiuitie of Babilon, who as they coulde not bee cōforted in their exile, but sate down, &amp; wept by the riuers of Babel, when they remembred Sion. So in the ioyfull time of their returne, yea in ye ioyful day of laying the foundation of the Temple, which they aboue all things had desired, in the middest of the ioiful shouting and singing of the residue of the people, their hartes yet melted within them, &amp; they wept with a loude crying, in so muche that the noyse of the shoutinge could not bee discerned from the noyse of the weeping,
                  Ezra. 3.12. and all was for this, because they had seene

the former Temple. And the foundatiō of this was not cōparable to that. What shall wee saye, Did these olde men dote? were they fonde vppon an outward shewe of faire building? No: but as their chiefe delight was in the house of god, so the increase of the glorie thereof, was their ioye, &amp; the diminishing of the glorie therof, was their sorowe and griefe of minde. Thus ielous were they ouer Gods glorie, that in the outward shewes and shadowes they were impatient of any want. But amongst vs, there is small weepinge, though the buylders in their building haue left out the chiefe corner stone, which should be the garnishing of all the worke. They haue left out the gouernement of Christ, without ye which, that their Churche can bee his house, though they face and brace neuer so much, how should they thinke it possible? For they muste knowe, that Christe dwelleth not, where he ruleth not. He maye not bee an idle Idoll. His Churche and Kingdome in this worlde, is outwarde and visible, and

except he gouerne visiblie, euen by his outwarde ordinances: It is vayne for vs to say, He ruleth in our hartes: and in the church that we are ioyned vnto we submitt our selues to the ordinances of Antichrist. Wee shall soone banishe Christ frō our hartes, if we haue no more care of his glorie then so, but can abide to see his Sanctuarie prophaned and polluted by that Heathenishe straunger of Rome, whiche not onelie set his foote in there euery day, but also erecteth there his owne altar of incense▪ For prayers and thankes giuing must bee measured out and appointed after his fashion.
            If euer we had seene the beautie of the first building, I meane in the time of the primitiue Churche, wee might wel nowe, if we had not stonie hartes, weepe and lament with loude crying, in seeinge this buyldinge before oure eyes. Not so much for that it is inferiour to the other in glorie: but for that it hath neither glorie nor beautie at all, being fashioned not after anie paterne shewed of God, but after the deuise

and counsel of man. In which miserie if our notable anguishe and greeuous grones were hearde in the eares of the Lorde, and in vs there were no want to call and stirre vp one another, and ioyne handes, for the helpe of the furtherance of the worke in bringing home the Arke of God: there were then greater hope of the daye wherein we might &amp; ought to reioyce, as Dauid here did.
            Moreouer, we note in Dauid, that his ioye was so great in the Lorde, that he conteyned not him selfe, but so leaped and daunced, that he seemed in the eyes of the wicked, as a foole, whiche vncouereth his shame, and become vile. For after that maner did Michal his wife reprochefullie taunte him,2. Sam. 6. as one whiche had so vily vncouered him self, that he should be a mocking stocke vnto the Maidens of Israel. But hee answered, that it was before the lord, who had performed vnto him so great mercie: for whose cause he woulde bee yet more vile and lowe in his owne sight. And saide moreouer, that of the

same Maidens whereof hee had spoken, he should bee had in honour. Whereby we see, how litle he weighed to become base and lowe in the sight of the worlde, so hee might sett foorth the glorie of the Lorde his God.
            At this day amongest vs, one of the greatest lettes &amp; hinderaunces of the Lordes worke finishing, is, for that it can not be done without the abasinge of the loftines of manie men whiche are exalted without the Lorde. As for the titles of Gracious and Honourable Lords, our Sauior Christ taught his Apostles that they might not bee amongest them. Therefore if these men so exalted, would loue and care for the Lords honour more then their owne, and would willinglie giue ouer their monstrous liuings, and all their worldlie pompe, though they thinke it were a great shame for them, and that they shoulde seeme vile before men, (whiche they ought willinglie to vndergoe,
                  Heb. 12.
                     •
                  . for his glories sake, who suffered the crosse and despised the

shame) yet if they coulde see it, it would tende to their more true dignitie. For of all the people in Englande whiche wayte for a more full appearaunce of Gods glorie in his house, they shoulde be had in honour. Where as nowe contrariewise they receyue honour onelie of a fewe flattering seruinge men, within their owne houses, whiche liue by bringinge dishes to their Table, and almost to all the residue of the people of the lande, their name is in reproche, and they are become a Byworde and a common talke.
            Our Sauiour Christ thought it no shame to abase him selfe to washe his Disciples feete: by that example,
                  Iohn 13.5. and manie more teaching those which will followe him, that they must not thinke much to be baze and vile, and dishonorable in the sight of men, if they will looke for true honour in the sight of GOD. The Angel Gabriel sayde vnto Zacharias,
               
                  Luke 1.15. that his Sonne Iohn the Baptist shoulde bee great in the sight of the Lorde.
            
               But what greatnes he had in the fight of the worlde, it appeareth, when as his clothing was of Camels heare, &amp; his meate was Locustes and wilde honie. The authour to the Hebrewes speaketh of some Christians, whiche were racked, and would not be deliuered,
                  Heb. 11.35. that they might receyue a better resurrection. They woulde needes abide torment and shame, that in the Lorde they might haue their onelie refreshment, and their onelie glorie. And he became their glorie, and the lifter vp of their heade.
            Our Sauior Christ who thought it no robberie, to be equal with God, he yet in his nature of man, became vile, and tooke vpon him the shape of a seruaunt: Hee turned his face to the striker: He humbled him selfe, euen to the death of the crosse. Therefore was giuen him a name and dignitie aboue al names,
                  Phil. 2.9. that at his name euery knee should bowe.
            But great is the darkenes and vngodlines of these dayes, when those which professe them selues to bee his

Ministers, doo so order their goings, and conforme them selues so little vnto the image of his life, that wee may sooner trace out the shewe of all the great glorie of this worlde, then of Christian poorenes in spirit by their footesteppes. And it is too manifest, that thei are ouercome with the temptation of him whiche sayde: All these glorious thinges will I giue thee,
                  Mat. 4.9. if thou wilt fall downe and worship me. For they declare howe hardelie they would abide themselues to be plucked vp by the rootes, that they might bee planted in a better resurrection, when as they will not suffer their superfluous braunches to be cut of, which doo so ouerhange and annoye the lanes, that the Lordes passengers can not ride on their iourneye towardes Sion.
            There be also of the Temporaltie diuers, which esteme it to vile a thing, and vnsittinge for their dignitie, to come vnder the censure of the church, that their faultes shoulde bee looked

vnto, and they should be subiect to the Admonition, Rebuke, and Excommunication of the Minister and the Congregation. Therefore they say: Let vs breake their bandes in sunder, and cast their cordes from vs.
                  Psal. 2. But if they vnderstoode the great mysterie of the Lorde, and the decree, which is sealed vp amongst his Disciples:
                  Psa. 8.16. they should well know, that their renowne &amp; glorie is no more impaired by bowyng &amp; giuing due homage to Christs Scepter, then the flower and oyle of the widowe of Sarepta was diminished, by giuing away part of that litle which she had, vnto Elias. For certainly the great and noble Potentates of this worlde, if they doo not intertaine the Kingdome of Christ Iesus, thoughe their name reache the clowdes: yet in trueth their honour and renowne is small, and skarcely to be accounted an handfull, which when it is spent, they die. Then their name perishe, and their pompe will not followe them.
                  Ecclesiastes 9.4. Then is a liuing dogge

better then they. For doth not their dignitie goe away with them?
                  Iob. 4.21. Doo they not die and that without wisdom? Whereas if they would be content to giue away vnto our Elias Christ Iesus, a litle of their honour by abasing themselues before his Throne of gouernement: they shoulde haue neuer the lesse, but a great deale the more: yea the continuance of true honour for euer. For they shoulde stand as the faithfull witnesses in heauen, their names being registred in the booke of life. According as the Prophet Esaiah speakethe of the renowne of the Church, and accoūteth it the renowne of Kinges and Princes, to worshipp therein with their faces towards the earth,
                  Esai. 49.23. and to licke vp the dust at the feete thereof.
            Lastlie as touching Dauids affection of ioye, and his delight which he hadd to see the glorie of God shine forthe: as it was declared by signes, yea the whole disposing of himselfe, to be great at that present time: so did

the continual practise of his life afterward, giue token that it was intiere and vnfeined. For he continued his care and studie to be an instrument to aduaunce Gods glorie.
            Of our sone whote &amp; sone colde zeale: and of our gladnes, which bewraied it selfe to be more for the shining hope of our worldlie welfare, then for the hope of the increase of Gods kingedome, and the speedy cōming thereof: And of our loue, whiche haue giuen place to iniquitie soone getting the vpper hande: And of all our forwardnes and goodnes, which appeared in the day, when the Lorde opened one dore for vs to come out of prison, and an other dore to haue entred his Tabernacles, if we would haue but strained our selues a litle to haue remoued a fewe blockes in the waie: Of this our goodnes and forwardnes, howe that it proued but as a morning mist, which vanished before any heat of the Sunne brast forth: I haue spoken before. Litle was that we had, therfore

was taken from vs euen that litle. Great was the true and sincere ioye, faith, zeale &amp; loue which Dauid hadd: therefore was giuen vnto him more. For he continued faithefull to him which hadd called him through grace, and for the remembrance of his great goodnes, he still in hart desired to add more labour vnto the Lords worke. For the Arke being brought home, &amp; placed in a tent, he desired to builde an house for the same. And if it hadd seemed good in the eyes of the Lord, to haue vsed his hande therin, as he did accept of his hart and goodwill: he woulde haue chose rather to haue bene destitute himselfe of a princelie pallace, then yt the Arke of god should haue bene without a royall house, for the more manifestinge of the glorie thereof. And when he receyued answere from ye Lord, that he should not build an house vnto him, but his sonne shoulde builde it: yet as muche as he might, he did with all his power, and became a cheefe builder one waye,

when as an other waye hee could not, namelie, in preparinge those thinges which should furnishe the worke, and set it forwarde with speede, when it shoulde be begonne. For he said: My sonne Salomon is yonge and tender, and we must buylde an house for the Lorde,1. Chro. 22. magnificall, excellent, and of great fame and dignitie thoroughout all Countries. I will therefore nowe prepare for him. And hee prepared an hundred thousande Talentes of golde, and a thousande thousande Talentes of Siluer: And of Brasse and of Iron, passinge weight: And also Tymber and Stones, and he had sett Masons to hewe and polish the stones in readinesse. And yet for all this, his hunger for Gods glorie, was not satisfied, but hee complayned that hee was able to doo no more. For hee sayde to his Sonne Salomon: according to my pouertie I haue prepared these thinges.
                  Ver. 14.
            
            There was then no necessitie of an house: For the Arke was kept in the

Tabernacle, whiche figured the churche, and that was after Gods institution. And the necessitie of hauinge the Temple came not vntill the Lords commaundement appointed a time therevnto. Neyther was there any ruine of thinges pertaining to Gods house at that time. Yet you see howe Dauid behaued himselfe, not constrained by any necessitie of the time, but inflamed by his true affection, which hungred for the further glorie of those things, which represented Gods glorie.
            There be witnesses in England, which know, howe that exceding manie mouthes of the teachers, and of those which speak as they are taught, haue confessed concerning their Churche: Some, that it is ruinous: Yet will they make the stones whole againe out of the duste, not with a worke, as Nehemiah did with building: but with a word or two, in saying, it is the churche of God yet notwithstanding.
            
               Some saye, It is naked, and yet a Churche: And thoughe it bee both hungrie and naked, they giue it such a beggars almes, as ye Apostle Iames speake of: Goe warme thee, and fill thy bellie.
                  Iames 2.16. For they saye, God helpe it, wee shall praye for it. In the meane time nothinge is ministred to susteyne it with, touchinge that they complayne to bee wantinge vnto it, therefore what helpeth it?
            Some saye, It is as a man that wante a legge, and yet a church. But the Scripture saye, That that which is halting, is neare to bee turned out of the waye.
                  Heb. 12. Some saye, It want but an arme, &amp;c. But all this while they espie not wherein the greatest deformitie lieth, namelie, In that it hath a little pretie bodie, and a great sorte of monstrous great heades. I meane those of whome wee maye well complayne with the Prophete, and saye: O Christe,
                  Esai. 26.13. Other Lordes besides thee haue ruled ouer vs.
            But because I knowe herein my ment

will be sifted: I saye for my selfe, that I iudge them not, nor condemne them. The worde of the Lorde iudgeth all them and mee.
            But concerninge the Churche of Englande, as they inticle it: It is a notable dishonour vnto Christ Iesus, to make all the Parishes in England generallie his Churche, hee will giue no thankes for that liberalitie. Yet I am perswaded (the Lorde I take to witnesse) that in the Realme of Englande there bee diuers Churches. And I hope also that there bee manie more true worshippers, or such at the least as the Lorde doeth accept, whiche abhorre and deteste to bowe the knee to the Antichristian scepter, more I saye, then seeme to appeare, as was in Israel in the dayes of the Prophete Eliah. But that the booke whiche is for Gods worshippe and seruice, and yet beareth not the name of God, that euer it caused Tabernacle to bee so framed, as that the Lord shoulde knowe it for his owne, I vtterlie

denie.
            But to returne to my purpose. Seeing the case so standeth that the ruines and decayes of the Churches be apparant by a generall confession almoste of all: Yea seeing it is also confessed, that shee is sicke vnto death, and lie panting for breath: let vs not thinke, that sweete and smoothe wordes will heale her deadlie hurte, as to saye: yet it is a famous Churche, and other nations haue thought well &amp; reuerentlie of the Churche of Englande. &amp;c. But let all with whome is yet the feare of the liuinge GOD, and anie desire of his glorie, laye the hande to the worke, no more but euen thus, by eschewing euill, and dooing good, that although they goe forwarde in fewenesse, according to their pouertie for a tyme, yet by their example, and aduertisementes, they maye winne manie vnto righteousenesse, by callinge, and stirringe vppe after this maner: Come, lette vs goe vp to the mountaine of the Lorde,
                  Esai. 2.3. to the house of the

GOD of Iacob, and he shall teache vs his wayes, and wee will walke in his pathes.
            Let them also saye eche to other, that because we sought not the Lorde in dewe order, therefore heare we this complainte to our rebuke and shame: There was neuer more wickednes then is nowe.
            Thus if we do, labouring not more faintlie, because iniquitie hath gotten the vpper hande, but more valiauntlie to redeeme the times, because the dayes be euill, wee shall bee foūde in the sight of the Lorde, accordinge to our abilitie, to haue polished &amp; made readie liuinge stones for the Lordes buyldinge, that although wee can see the worke goe but slowlie forwarde in our dayes, yet in the next generation it may rise more speedily to the glorie of GOD. And let none vtter these wordes of vnfaythfulnes, Alas what can I doo, or what can twoo or three of vs doo, or howe are wee like to goe forwarde?
            
               So I maye saye, what can a graine of Mustarde seede doo? It is small to beholde. But beinge caste into the grounde in dewe time, and watered, wee see what it dooeth, and howe it spreadeth. So wee maye saye, what can wee doo, if wee sitte still? But if wee labour in the Lordes businesse, so as wee giue our selues ouer to bee sowne in the earth for his truethes sake, vndoubtedlie, out of oure dead bones or ashes there will springe vp manie more witnesses, vntill the glorious cause florishe gloriouslie.
            But to proceede.
            I reioyced when they sayde vnto mee. &amp;c.
            It is written in the Chronicles, that Dauid gathered all Israel togither,1. Chro 15. to goe vp to Ierusalem. And in that the people were so hartilie willinge, sayinge, That they woulde goe vp to the house of the Lorde, and their feete shoulde stande in the gates of Ierusalem,

wee maye note this, that the Lorde nowe being with Dauid, after hee hadde feared before his face, and carefullie sought him in dewe order, hee addeth blessinge vnto blessing vnto him, to make his ioye full. For hee doeth not onelie make him to see the Arke come home in peace, but also giue him the hartes of all the people, as one man reioysinge with him, and praysing the Lorde, then the whiche nothing coulde refreshe and solace his minde more cherefullie ouer his grief paste.
            Thus doth the Lord make things to succeed with them (yea oftentimes more then they looke for) which seeke him in feare and tremblinge, and attempte to worke accordinge to his will.
            Thus Nehemiah, when his harte had conceyued that enterprise of building of the walles of Ierusalem, hee not onely obteyned leaue of the King to goe thither, whiche thing he hoped not for without feare: but also the

Lorde made him obtayne that whiche was least looked for, euen helpe and furniture of Timber towardes the worke. Moreouer, the Lorde gaue him the hartes of the people, who notwithstandinge their pouertie and fewnesse, yet were incouraged to worke with vnwonted forwardnesse.
            So Moses, though hee had a frowarde companie to guyde, yet when hee went about the Tabernacle makinge, with all thinges apperteyning therevnto, accordinge to the Lordes commaundement, hee founde the peoples hartes so willinge and readie to offer, and their handes so full of giftes, that hee cryed, Ho, and commaunded them to ceasse from offringe anie more.
                  Exod. 36.6.
            
            Therefore, let there be no vnchearfull wordes amongest vs, to weaken our handes before we begin to worke. As some saye, Howe is it possible? Where shall wee haue fitte men for Elders? Where shall wee haue sufficient Ministers ynough? And where

shall we haue this and that?
            It is the propertie of a slouthfull seruaunt, to tell before hee goe out, howe hee is not like to speede. Let vs in the middest of all streightnes and impossibilities, take in hande our enterprise in the Lord with humblenes, wisedome, &amp; single hartednes: and we shal see successe not only in those thinges which we can foresee &amp; hope for: but also manie things vnlooked for of vs, shalbe prospered into our bosome.
            Nowe whereas the people speak so willingly, saying: We will go vp into the house of the lord: it declareth their forwardnes vnto a good enterprise. But the King had called them &amp; stirred them vp therevnto. So peraduenture it may seeme that the people are not to go vp into the Lordes house: especiallie to go about such an heauenlie busines, as thei now did, without their Kings &amp; Princes going before them. As for ye Arke, though it bare a spiritu all representatiō of holy things, yet it was a material thing, &amp; the bringing

of it home required outwarde furniture and preparation accordinglie. But what the Priestes and people might haue done as touching it, if the King should haue bene to slacke: when I shall vnderstande it to bee doubted of: aunswere shall be made as GOD shall giue leaue.
            In the meane time, it is not amisse to speake some thinge of a question whiche flyeth much abroade, whiche haue bene taken vp rather of desire to intangle, then of anie loue of ye truth, as shoulde seeme by the disorderlie framinge and propoundinge thereof. The question is this:
Whither the Prince or the people ought first to beginne reformation in the Church?
            
            I aunswere with propoundinge other questions. Can they tell whether Prince or people ought firste to turne to the Lorde? Whether Prince or people ought firste to do their duetie?

Or, whither ye head, the hand, or ye foot ought first to do that, which seuerallie appertaineth to ye office of ech of those mēbers to do? For Kings &amp; Princes ought to reform without delay or waiting for other, so farr as the bounds of their calling reach: and ye people they ought to reforme without al delaye or tarying for other, so farr as the boūds of their calling reach also. But howe farre the bounds of eche doo extende, therein lieth the chief point.
            In the name of God, let Caesar haue whatsoeuer vnto him belongeth, euen all ciuile power and Dominion ordayned of God. And woe vnto him, saye I, whiche shall holde this, and teache men so, that there is no vse of the Magistrates sworde among Christians. For that is to remoue ye doole of the great and large fielde which the Lorde haue measured out vnto them. And that is also to depriue Christians of that benefite of peace whiche the Lord haue ordayned that wee should enioye by their meanes.
            
               For it is written: Exhort, that Prayers,1. Tim. 2.2. and Supplications be made for Kinges, and all that be in authoritie, that vnder them we may lead a godlie and peaceable life.
            Therefore I am thus perswaded, that as the Kinges of Iuda did reforme by their ciuile power, those things which outwardly were sett vp for abominations: namely, as they did break downe the altars, cutt downe the groues, burne the images with fire, slaye the Preistes of Baal, and suche like thinges: So also it appertaineth to the Magistrates now, to break downe the idolatrous altars, plucke downe their buildinges, burne their images with fire, &amp; to slaye those, which haue reuolted frō Christianitie to open idolatrie. And herein wee prayse the Lorde, who strengthned our Princes handes, to worke so farre, as was wrought therin. And if our sinnes had not displeased the Lorde, we shoulde haue sene more.2. King. 13.18. For I would to God the Arrow had not bene shott against

the ground only three times, but three hundred times three times, that a full conquest for euer might haue bin gotten ouer those Antichristian Aramits.
            
            And now concerning those abominations, which remaine, which partly I haue spoken of: As the offices, rowmes, and liuinges of the Lordlie ouerrulers of many churches, together with Deanes, &amp; Deanaries, Prebēds and Prebenshippes, Cathedralles wt the Chaunters therin, and their Marmaiden musick, Bishops Chaūcelors, Archdeacons, Cōmissaries, Proctors Officials, Sūners &amp; Questmen, whiche all do robbe ye church of her authoritie &amp; libertie, and strippe her naked: These I say, wt their Courtes &amp; Canō lawes, as also freehold Parsonages &amp; Uicariges, which hinder the free election &amp; deposing of the Minister: Also blind &amp; dūme ministers, with ye forme of stinted seruice to be read, being the staffe of strength of vpholding thē: All these wormewoode dregges of Antichrists cupp, &amp; whatsoeuer more, it appertaineth only to the office of ye ciuile

Magistrate, to powre out and rince euen from the bottom. Which ye Lord graunt that it may soone be done.
            And whereas we are charged that we will take vpon vs to remoue these things, &amp; establishe newe lawes for other gouernement: we are most iniu

               i
                  •
               uslie slaundered. For we contrariewise charge al in ye name of God, that they be not so hardie, as by any authoritie whiche they may imagine they haue, as being of the church of God, to meddle once to moue the hand to take away these thinges: For that were to take ye sword out of Cesars hād. Therfore they ought to wayte for this maner of reformation, with cōtinuing inferuent praier to God for the hastning thereof. But herein lieth the duetie of Gods people, to remoue them selues from these &amp; all other abominations, &amp; not to haue fellowship with ye vnfruitfull workes of darkenes:
                  Ephe. 5.1. not to ioyne handes with open wickednes, but to keepe our selues vnspotted therof, not to go vnder anie yoke of spirituall bō
               dage,
                  Galat. 5.1.
               
to betraye the libertie &amp; authoriritie which Christ haue left with vs to keepe, but to stand faste in the libertie wherein hee hath made vs free. By the vertue of which libertie and authoritie, the Church of God haue to trie and examine the giftes, and conuersation, of those which should leade thē, and finding them meet to chuse them, and perceyuinge them afterwarde to fall to anie euill heresie in doctrine, or to loosenes of life, and will not bee reclaymed by dewe admonition, to depose them. Also by the power of the same libertie and authoritie, the churche of GOD haue to vse their dewe admonitions, and rebukinges of offendours. Euerie one maye bringe his complainte in due order: And such offendours as will not heare the churche, and bee reformed,
                  Mat. 18.17 must feele the sworde of excommunication by the woorde of GOD, to bee cutte of, and to bee deliuered vnto Satan,1. Cor. 5. to stirre them vpp to bewayle their wickednesse and to repent, if the Lorde so

touche their hartes. And this authoritie of punishinge the transgressours by the Ecclesiasticall sworde, maye not be taken out of the Churches handes, neither can the Churche giue it ouer without denyinge Christe, who haue left this his power vnder their charge:
                  Mat. 18.18 Although the ciuile Magistrates maye and ought also to strike with their sworde, euerie one whiche beinge of the Churche, shall openlie transgresse against the Lordes commaundementes.
            Moreouer, it standeth with the libertie of the Lordes Congregation, to vse prayers and thankes giuing alwayes, as the present occasion requireth.
            These and suche like things appertayne to the office of the Lordes Ministers, togyther with their Congregations. And as for the reforminge of these thinges, where soeuer anie wante bee: What vngodlie tongue dare bee so bolde, as to saye, we ought to tarie one howre? No, but if we tarie

for a newe graunt from men to doo our dueties in the true worshippe of God, when as we haue alreadie sufficient graunt from heauen: we shall die in our sinnes, and our bloude shall be vpon our owne heades.
            Nowe, if the Ministers and peoples duetie and charge extende vnto this which I haue mentioned: it followeth, that nothing is wanting vnto true Churche gouuernement, but so much as the people, and especially the Ministers which shoulde guide them, are wanting vnto their duetie enioyned to them by the Lorde.
            Wherefore in the Lorde, I doo require some of those Ministers in Englande, whiche thinke hardlie of our doinges, and yet perswade them selues that they hartilie desire the full repayring of the Walles of Ierusalem: That they would set downe by proofe of the worde of God, that whiche is wanting to true &amp; full church gouernement, besides that whiche is their duetie to doo, togither with their Cōgregation,

whom they ought to stirre vp to their duetie likewise. If there be anie thinge at all: I will promise and vowe faythfullie to tarie and wayte wt them also. If there be nothing, why do they make so long suing at the Parliaments, &amp; suffer so manie poore soules at home to be depriued of their heauē
               lie well fare, and to suffer sinne so too ouerspreade by their default, which by their keepinge the Lordes watche, might be cutt shorter? For what sewe they for vnto the Prince and Parliament? Euen for a lawe to cōpell them to doo that which the Lord haue commaunded them to doo. Why doo they it not in haste, by the vertue of Gods cōmaundement alreadie giuē, so long as they can in peace? And when they no longer can, why suffer thei not persecution for his sake, whom they must obeye before man? and who haue said: Blessed are they, whiche suffer persecutiō for righteousnes sake:
                  Mat. 5.10. for theirs is the kingdome of heauen.

must seeke both in wealth and woe,
