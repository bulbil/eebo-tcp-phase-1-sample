            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

HONOVRABLE, RIGHT
Worſhipfull, and other my much
reſpected Pariſhioners, Inhabitants in Blacke-Friers
London, All needfull Proſperitie in
this world, and eternall Felicitie in
the World to come
            
               I DESIRE (my much honoured and entirely
beloued Pariſhioners) ſo long as
the Lord of life ſhall preſerue mee in the
Land of the liuing, I deſire to goe on in
promoting your ſpiritual edification euery
way that I can, priuately, publikely, by prayer, by
preaching, yea and by printing too. Behold here an euidence
thereof. What priuately I firſt digeſted in mine
owne meditation, and then publikely deliuered by word
of mouth, whereof in the open Church you heard your
children and ſeruants examined,Deus eſt nobis ſummum bonum. Ne

                   infra remanendum nobis eſt, ne

many prayers by vs all ioyntly and ſeuerally haue
beene poured out before God, is now thorow Gods gracious
prouidence ſo publiſhed as it may be reuiewed ſo
oft as you pleaſe. Well accept it: for it is A GVIDE
TO GOE TO GOD. God is the higheſt, and chiefeſt
Good, below which we may not remaine, beyond which
we cannot attaine. To place our reſt in any thing before

we come to God is dangerous.Oratione intramus coelestem illam curiam in qua Rex regum ſtellato ſedet ſolio &amp;c. Bern. Serm. de 4. modis Orand. Oratione praeſentamus nos quaſi ſaci
                     •
                   ad faciem cum Deo loquentes. Ibid. To attaine to any reſt beyond
God is impoſſible. This therefore, is that proper
place whether the ſoule well enlightened and rectified aſpireth,
as all hot light things aſpire to the high hot Region.
The meanes whereby wee men on earth haue acceſſe
to God in Heauen, is Prayer. By Prayer we enter into
the Court where God ſitteth in his Maieſtie, and wee
preſent out ſelues before him ſpeaking vnto him as it
were face to face. That therefore which inſtructeth vs to
pray aright, directeth vs to God. This doth the Lords
Prayer: And nothing can doe it better. For this end, To
teach vs how to pray, it was firſt preſcribed. It is not onely
a moſt abſolute prayer in it ſelfe, but alſo a perfect patterne
for other prayers. And in this reſpect the only way
wherein we can goe to God. Full of matter is this forme
of Prayer, but few the words thereof. Such fulneſſe of
matter in ſo few words make it to many as the propheſie
of Chriſt was to Candaces Eunuch, whereof he ſaid (to
him that moued this queſtion, Vnderstandeſt thou what
thou readeſt?) How can I except I had a guide? A guide
therefore is needfull for many to direct them in this way
to goe to God. Loe a Guide at hand. This Explanation of
the Lords Prayer is offered to you for that purpoſe. But as
a Guide that directeth a Traueller in his iourney to the
Kings Court, maketh not the way better, but ſheweth
him how to order his trauell in that way: ſo this Guide,
this Explanation, addeth nothing to the Perfection of the
Prayer, but onely helpeth you in the vſe thereof. The
many particulars which miniſter iuſt matter of ardent
ſupplication, hearty gratulation, deepe humiliation, and
conſcionable obſeruation of our wayes, are in this Explanation
diſtinctly ſet out. Thereby you may ſee how rich a
Cabonet the Lords Prayer is: how full of moſt precious

iewels, vſefull for the ſoule of man. The Excellencie of this
forme of Prayer is ſet forth in the firſt Section of this
Explanation. Whatſoeuer is therein performed is the
fruit of my affected Retiredneſſe, and ſuſpected Idleneſſe
in the countrey. So many, ſo continuall are my imployments
in the Citie, ſo many interruptions from my ſtudies
day after day are there cauſed, as I neuer yet could
find any leaſure to ſet down diſtinctly ſuch points as by
Gods aſſiſtance were vttered out of the Pulpet. Whatſoeuer
hath hitherto been publiſhed by me, hath in my retiring
time been prepared for the Preſſe. This benefit of
a few weekes abſence in the yeare from my charge (there
being in that time a good ſupply made by my Reuerend
Brethren) may gaine a ſufficient diſpenſation with thoſe
that are not too ſupercilious; which I hope you, my Pariſhioners,
will not be. For I haue euer found ſuch true
loue, ſuch good reſpect, ſuch kinde vſage, ſuch fauourable
acceptance of all my paines in euery kinde, as I haue iuſt
cauſe to bleſſe the diuine prouidence for bringing me to
this place. The Lord God ſo bleſſe all my labours vnto
you all, as we may haue al iuſt cauſe to bleſſe him one for
another, and to continue mutually and heartily to pray
one for another. Doe ye ſo: So will doe

            A GVIDE TO GOE
TO GOD:
OR,
AN EXPLANATION OF THE PERfect
Patterne of Prayer,
THE LORDS PRAYER.
         
            
               §. 1. Of the Excellencie of the Lords Prayer.
               
                  THoſe two things which are of greateſt
weight to commend vnto our diligent
conſideration, the reading or hearing of
any thing, do after an eſpeciall manner
commend the Lords Prayers: The Author
and the Worke it ſelfe.
               Two things in an Author make his
worke to be
eſteemed

                     1. Eminencie of place.
                     2. Excellencie of parts.
                  
               
               The worke of a King is honoured, becauſe it is the worke of
a King, euen for his place ſake.
               The worke of a great Scholer is admired for his learning ſake,
though in his eſtate he be neuer ſo meane.
               Two things alſo in the Matter or worke it ſelfe do commend
it

                     1. The perfection of it.
                     2. The profit that may be got by it.
                  
               
               If an Art be accuratly handled, and ſo perfectly ſet out, as
nothing can be found defectiue, and yet no ſuperfluous redundancie
therein, euery good Student will be ſure to haue it, and
will diligently ſtudie it. Or if a worke that may bring much

profit to ſuch as carefully vſe it, be publiſhed, hee will be
thought careleſſe of his owne good that vſeth it not.
               When all theſe meet together, an excellent Author and a
worthie Worke: an Author to reſpected for eminencie of perſon,
and excellencie of parts: a worke to be regarded for the abſolute
perfection of it in it ſelfe, and for the neceſſitie and vtilitie
of it to vs, they are as a fourefold twiſted cord, to draw our
minds thereto, and to binde them thereon.
               Such an Author is the indighter of this Prayer,The excellency of the Lords Prayer. and ſuch a
Worke is the Prayer it ſelfe. This title, The Lords Prayer, implyeth
as much. The Lord is the Author. Prayer the Worke.
               
               By the Lord is ment that one Lord Ieſus Chriſt,
                  1. The Author of it. 
                  by whom are
all things,
                  2. Cor. 8. 6. 
                  and we by him. The eminencie of whoſe perſon is ſuch,
as he hath a name giuen him aboue euerie name.
                  Phil. 2. 9. No Monarch on
earth, no Angell in heauen to be compared vnto him.
               In regard of the excellencie of his gifts,Ioh. 3. 34. 
                  God gaue him not the
Spirit by meaſure: for it pleaſed the Father that in him all fulneſſe
ſhould dwell.
                  Coloſ. 1. 19. For he is the onely begotten Sonne that is in the boſome
of the Father,
                  Iohn 1. 18. and knoweth what is the will of the Father, what
moſt pleaſing and acceptable to him; and what ſuites he is willing
to grant vnto his children. God would haue many things
to be ſpoken and heard by the Prophets his ſeruants,Multa per Prophetas ſeruos ſuos dici Deus voluit &amp; audiri: ſed quanto maiora ſunt qua filius loquitur? Cypr. de Orat. Dom. §. 1. but how
much greater are the things which his Sonne vttereth?
               For the Worke none ſo heauenly, none ſo profitable as Prayer,
And among Prayers none to be compared vnto this, whether
we conſider the Matter contained in it, or the Manner of ſetting
it downe.
               The Matter is euery way ſound,2. The Matter of it. compleat, and perfect. Euery
word in it hath its weight. There is not one ſuperfluous word
in it that could be ſpared. Nor is it any way defectiue. Whatſoeuer
is lawfull, needfull, and meete to be asked in Prayer is
therein contained: yea whatſoeuer is to be belieued or practiſed
by a Chriſtian is therein implyed.Nihil omnino praetermiſſum eſt quod non in precibus noſtris coeleſtis doctrina compendio comprehenditur. Cypr. loc. cit. §. 5. No particle of any good
Prayer commended in the Scripture, or at any time by any perſon
well conceiued, but may be found couched in this. In this
forme are compriſed all the diſtinct kinds of Prayer: as Requeſt
for good things, Deprecation againſt euill, Interceſſion for others,
and Thanksgiuing.
               
               
                  
The Manner of ſetting downe the things contained in this
Prayer is anſwerable to the Matter.
                  3. The manner of expreſſing it. By it we are taught how
to begin Prayer, in what order to ſet euery Petition that wee
make, and how to conclude our Prayer.
               The order therein is as admirable as any other point.4. The order obſerued in it. Though
the things compriſed in it are innumerable, yet are they all
couched vnder ſo few words, as they may eaſily bee remembred.
               In a word,The perfection of it. nothing any way pertinent vnto Prayer is omitted
in this forme: and nothing is ſet downe therein which is not
pertinent vnto Prayer. It may therefore be fitly ſtiled a Catholicall,
and a Canonicall Prayer. Catholicall, in that it compriſeth
the ſubſtance of all warrantable Prayers in it. Canonicall, in that
it is the Canon or Rule to ſquare and frame all prayers by it.
               Is not this then a fit ſubiect for the greateſt that be,Too much paines cannot be taken about it. in dignitie,
in learning, in iudgement, in wit, or any other excellency
to exerciſe their meditation thereon? Can too much paines be
taken to open and diſcouer the rich treaſure contained
therein?
               Are not they vngratefull to the Author of it, and iniurious to
themſelues, who lightly eſteeme it?
               What may we thinke of Papiſts that ſuffer not the vulgar
people to learne it in their owne mother tongue?Papiſts abuſe it. Indeed they
ſuffer, yea and enioyne them to tumble it vp and downe, and to
mumble it againe and againe, as it were by tale vpon their beads
in an vnknowne tongue, whereby they make it a matter of
meere babling.
               What alſo may we thinke of Anabaptiſts and ſuch like Schiſmatickes
as forbid people to vſe it at all?Anabaptiſts vſe it not. Of all prayers this
without all contradiction is the moſt perfect, ſo as if any forme
at all may be vſed, then this moſt of all.
               
                  Obiect.
                  1. Argument of Anabaptiſts. It is ſo profound and deepe as it is impoſſible for anie
to fathome the depth of it.
               
                  Anſw. It will not thence follow, that it is not to be vſed at
all. Many of thoſe Petitions which Chriſtians in their owne
forme of Prayer do make, imply more matter, then in the time
of vttering them they are able to conceiue. Who can comprehend
the infiniteneſſe of Gods glorie? May we not therefore

pray as Chriſt did,Iohn 12. 28. 
                  Father glorifie thy name? Who can vnderſtand
his faults?
                  Pſal. 19. 12. Shall not a ſinner therefore aske pardon for all his
ſinnes?
               Who can in the time that Amen may be vttered, thinke of
euery particular point, that in a long Prayer hath bene mentioned
by way of Petition or Thankſgiuing? May not therefore
Amen be ſaid at the end of our owne or anothers Prayer, if it
haue bene long?
               Aſſuredly, a generall apprehenſion of more particulars then
can be diſtinctly conceiued at once, is acceptable to God: or
elſe many approued Prayers recorded in Scripture were not acceptable.
No man can in particular expreſſe all things that are
needfull and meete to be mentioned in Prayer: it is therefore
very requiſite that after we haue particularly and expreſly mentioned
in our Prayer, ſuch things as we conceiue to be moſt
needfull and behoouefull, we ſhould vſe ſome ſuch generall
words and phraſes, as may include all other needfull and behoouefull
things. In which reſpect the common cuſtome of
concluding our owne Prayers, with this perfect forme of Prayer
preſcribed by the Lord, is very commendable.
               2.2. Argument of Anabaptiſts. 
                  Obiect. This clauſe (After this manner pray yee) implyeth
rather a plat-forme to frame other Prayers by it,Math. 6. 9. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . then an expreſſe
forme to be vſed word for word.
               
                  Anſw. That phraſe may imply as well the very forme preſcribed
as a like forme. But Luke vſeth a phraſe which putteth
this doubt out of doubt.Luke 11. 2. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . It is this, When ye pray, ſay. What
ſhould they ſay? Euen the words following: Our Father which
art in heauen, &amp;c.
               
               
                  Queſt.
                  Other formes of Prayer may be vſed. What need any other forme of Prayer be vſed, ſeeing
this is ſo abſolutly perfect?
               
                  Anſw. To ſhew that we take a particular and diſtinct notice
of the things which we pray for. On which ground both Chriſt
himſelfe, and the Apoſtles alſo, to whom this forme in ſpeciall
was preſcribed, vſed other formes which are expreſſed in the
Scripture.
               By comparing theſe two forenamed places of the two Euangeliſts
together,Math. 6. 9. we may well gather that both this very forme
may be vſed:Luke 11. 2. and that other forme alſo may be framed anſwerable
to this.
               
                  
Behold,Gods goodnes in teaching vs to pray. here the goodneſſe of God, who is not onely readie
to heare vs in his Sonne, but alſo by his Sonne hath taught vs

to goe to the Throne of Grace? How much more effectually
may we obtaine what we aske in Chriſts name, if wee
aske it in his forme of Prayer?
               That wee may be the better directed, and the more encouraged
to call vpon God, and that by this excellent forme here preſcribed,
we will diſtinctly conſider the ſeuerall branches thereof.
            
            
               §. 2. Of the ſeuerall branches of the Lords Prayer.
               THE Lords Prayer being (as wee haue heard) a moſt perfect
patterne of Prayer,The ſumme and parts. it containeth both the Circumſtances
appertaining to Prayer, and alſo the very Subſtance of
Prayer.
               The Circumſtances are two. One precedent, which is the
Preparation thereto, in the Preface. The other ſubſequent, which
is the Ratification thereof, in the laſt Particle Amen.
               
               The Subſtance of the Prayer conſiſteth of two parts.
               1. Petition.
               2. Thanksgiuing.
                     S. Auguſt. ſometimes and ſome other ancient Writers, and moſt of the Papiſts, and ſome of our later Dimnes deuide the Lords Prayer into ſeuen Petitions: making two Petitions of the two clauſes in the laſt Petition.
                     But the vſuall diuiſion of it into twice three, is the moſt naturel, &amp; it is obſerued by Tertullian, Cyprian, Ambroſe, Cyril, Chryſo
                           •
                        tame, Bernard, and other ancient Fathers, who though they doe not expreſſe any distinct number of Petitions, yet they ſo handle them, as the number of ſix
                           •
                         may eaſily be thence gathered. For they make but one Petition of theſe words, Leade vs not into temptation, but deliuer vs from euill. The moderne Orthodox Expoſitors of Scripture, doe moſt of them expreſſely ſet downe the distinct number of ſixe Petitions. * As for that argument which is taken from the correſpondencie of the number of Petitions to the ſeuen graces of the Spirit, it is but an idle conceit. For there are many more graces of the Spirit then ſeuen. Of the diuiiſion of the laſt Petition out of which they raiſe the ſeuenth▪ See §. 269.
                  
               
               The Petitions are ſixe in number:Aug. in Enchir. cap. 115. &amp; in

                  Q. VVHat is firſt to be conſidered in the Lords Prayer?
               
                  A. The preface prefixed before it, in theſe
words, Our Father which are in heauen.
               
               Q. What generall inſtruction thence ariſeth?
               
                  A. Preparation is needfull vnto Prayer. For this Preface is
purpoſely prefixed to fit and prepare our hearts to Prayer.
To this very purpoſe tendeth this direction of the wiſe man, Bee
not raſh with thy mouth, and let not thine heart bee haſty to vtter
any thing before God.
                  Eccleſ. 5. 2. He there rendereth a weighty reaſon thereof,
taken from Gods Eminencie, God is in heauen, a moſt high
and glorious God. Men doe not raſhly enter into the preſence
of a King on earth. They will,Gen. 41. 14. as Ioſeph did, change their raiment:
yea they will thinke before hand both of the matter
which they intend to moue, and alſo of the manner of propounding
their ſuite. Should wee not much more come preparedly
into the preſence of the King of Kings?
               
               To the Eminencie of his Perſon before whom we come,1. Tim 6. 15. I may

well adde the Excellencie of the worke which is done. No other
worke is more excellent then prayer. If preparation be requiſite
vnto any worke, then moſt of all vnto Prayer.
            
            
               §. 4. Of the meanes to prepare vs to Prayer.
               
                  Queſt. HOw doth this Preface teach vs to prepare our ſelues to
Prayer?
               
                  Anſw. By deſcribing and ſetting forth God.
               
                  Queſt. What is thence taught vs?
               
                  Anſw.

                  A due conſideration of his perſon to whom we pray is an
eſpeciall meanes to prepare vs vnto Prayer. They who duely weigh
the Maieſtie of a king aboue other men, will with better reſpect
approach his preſence. I finde it vſuall with the Saints,
whoſe prayers are recorded in the Scripture, to be ample in ſetting
forth the glorious properties of God in the beginning of
their prayers, for which purpoſe note the prayers of1 King. 8. 23.

               Meditation hereof is an eſpeciall meanes to thruſt out of the
heart all bye and baſe thoughts, and to make the ſoule ſoare a
loft, and flie vp euen into heauen; yea when a mans Spirit is
dull, it will exceedingly quicken it, to call to minde Gods excellent
attributs and great workes, and to ponder them ſeriouſly.
               The neglect hereof is one cauſe of that little deuotion which
is in many mens hearts,Qui accedit ad deum per orationem, non perpenſa apud animum ſublimitate potentiae ad quam accedit, turpibus &amp; ſordidis petitionibus maieſtatem dedecorat imprudens, Greg. Nyſſ. ds Orat. while they are praying vnto God. Yea

the Lords Prayer be applyed?
               
                  
                  Anſw. To God, and to God alone. None elſe can be called
Our Father in heauen.
               
               
                  Queſt. What learne we thence?

               §. 6. Of Gods godneſſe and greatneſſe iointly
conſidered together.
               
                  Q. HOw is God deſcribed in the foreſaid Preface?
               
                  A. By his goodneſſe, and by his greatneſſe.
               
                  Q. What is thence inferred?
               
                  A. Gods goodneſſe and greatneſſe are both to be thought on when
we pray to God. Reade the Prefaces of the Prayers before quoted
§. 4. and of other like Prayers in Scripture, and ye ſhall find
thoſe two properties of old vſually ioyned together. The heathen
by the light of nature obſerued theſe two to be the moſt
principall attributs of God, and thereupon ſtiled him Optimus
Maximus. The one of theſe ſheweth how ready God is to
heare: the other how able he is to helpe: ſo as theſe are two
ſtrong pillars to ſupport our faith.
               A due conſideration of them both together,Mixture of faith and feare. is an eſpeciall
meanes to preſerue in vs a bleſſed mixture of Confidence and
Reuerence: both which are neceſſarie, becauſe the place before
which we preſent our ſelues in Prayer is a throne, at the footſtoole
whereof we muſt with all reuerence fall: and a throne
of Grace, to which with all confidence we muſt approach. And
thus ſhall we be kept in the golden meane, betwixt two dangerous
extremes, the gulfe of despaire, and the rocke of preſumption:
by either of which Prayer is made altogether, fruitleſſe.
For God turneth not to the doubting mind,
                  Iames 1. 6, 7. and turneth from
the proud heart:
                  Iam. 4. 6. ſo as both muſt needs returne emptie from
God.Iohn 5. 10. And no maruell: for he that beleeueth not maketh God a
lyar:
                  Pſal. 10. 4. and the proud thinketh there is no God.
               
               
                  
Learne therefore by the forenamed meditation on Gods
Goodneſſe and Greatneſſe to preſerue this ſoueraigne temperature
of faith and feare.Gods goodnes ſet before his greatneſſe. On Gods goodneſſe firſt let the eye of
thy meditation be fixed. For Chriſt teacheth vs to ſay, Our Father,
before he putteth vs in mind of Gods glorious place in heauen,
which order he obſerued when he himſelfe prayed, ſaying,
Father,
                  Math. 11. 25. 
                  Lord of heauen and earth: In this order the Apoſtle
ſtiles him,Epheſ. 1. 17. 
                  The God of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and Father of
glorie.
               
               I denie not but that there may be good vſe of ſetting Gods
greatneſſe before vs, and that it may in Prayer be firſt expreſſed,
as it is in the Prayers of Daniel,
                  Dan. 9. 4. 
                  Nehemiah, and other Saints:
but it muſt be by ſuch as haue a ſtedfaſt faith in Gods goodneſſe:
                  Nehe. 1. 5.
and at that time alſo muſt Gods goodneſſe be in their mindes,
as it was in Daniels: for ſo ſoone as he had ſaid, O Lord God,
great and fearefull, he immediatly addeth, which keepeſt couenant
and mercie, &amp;c. The brightneſſe of Gods greatneſſe would vtterly
dazell the eye of man, if firſt, immediatly, and onely it
ſhould be fixed thereon.
               This direction is of ſingular vſe to vs, baſe, ſinfull, wretched
creatures, who cannot but be aſtoniſhed at the thought of
Gods greatneſſe, power, iuſtice, iealouſie, and other like attributes.
               Hitherto of ſuch generall instructions as the Preface of the Lords
Prayer teacheth. The particular branches ſhall in order be
handled. The firſt whereof, concerneth Gods goodneſſe in this
clauſe (OVR FATHER) wherein we are to conſider Firſt,
the relatiue title giuen to God (FATHER) Secondly, the correlatiue
particle (OVR) whereby a particular application of
that generall relation is made. In handling the title, we will
declare: Firſt the thing it ſelfe here attributed to God, which
is PATERNITIE or FATHERHOOD. Secondly, the
manner of expreſſing it in the vocatiue caſe, and ſecond perſon:
as if more fully it had bene thus ſaid, O THOV OVR
FATHER.
               
            
            
               
               §. 7. Of this title Father applyed to God.
               
                  Q.
                  
                     Father a title proper to God. IS this title Father proper to God?
               
                  A. Yea, moſt properly it appertaineth to him. For it
is the true and proper title of him that giueth a being to that
whereof he is called a Father. They therefore among men that
vnder God are inſtruments of the being of others, who bring
children forth into this world, are moſt vſually called Fathers.
But it is God onely that doth truly and properly giue a being
to things:Math. 23. 9. whereupon Chriſt ſaith of him, There is but one your
Father,
                  1. Cor. 8. 6. 
                  which is in heauen: and the Apoſtle to like purpoſe,
There is but one God,
                  Epheſ. 4. 6. 
                  the Father: and among other vnities hee
reckons this, One God and Father.
               
               Now God is ſtiled Father both in relation to his Sonne the
ſecond perſon in Trinitie,Whoſe father God is. and alſo in relation to his creatures.
In the former reſpect it can be applyed onely to the firſt perſon
in Trinitie,Iohn 3. 16. whoſe onely begotten Sonne the ſecond perſon is: and
that by reaſon of his eternall generation,
                  Prou. 8. 24, 25. and of the hypoſtaticall
vnion of his two natures in one perſon.Luke 1▪ 35. In the latter reſpect it
may be applyed to all the three perſons in Trinitie.Iohn 1. 14. For not
onely the firſt,
                  Math. 28. 19. but the ſecond perſon alſo is expreſly called Father:
and we are ſaid to be borne of the Spirit,
                  Iſa. 9. 6. which is a worke
of paternitie.
                  Iohn 3. 5. All the three perſons then are included vnder this
title Father: And Prayer may be made to them all ioyntly as one
in ſubſtance, and to any of them expreſly by name, yet ſo, as
when one onely is named neither of the other be excluded. For
the Father is alwayes to be called vpon in the name of the
Sonne by the aſſiſtance of the Spirit.Rom. 8. 26. 
                  Elſe we know not what to
pray as we ought.
               
               This one God diſtinguiſhed into three perſons,Iob 38. 28. is ſaid to be
the Father of his creatures, firſt generally, as he hath giuen a being
to them all: ſecondly ſpecially as he hath ſet his image on
ſome of them aboue others.
               His Image is ſet on his creature two wayes.
               1. By that excellencie wherein he created them.
               2. By renewing an excellencie in ſome of them after their
fall.
               
                  
By reaſon of that primarie excellencie,Luke 3. 38. 
                  Adam and Angels
are ſtiled ſonnes of God:Iob 1. 6. for in regard of thoſe diuine qualities,
and that glorious eſtate wherewith he adorned them aboue
other creatures at the beginning, they are ſaid to be made
after the Image of God.
               
               The Image of God, which is a kind of diuine excellencie, is
renewed onely in ſome of the ſonnes of men: and that in a ciuill
and ſpiritu
                        •
                     ll reſpect.
               
                  In a ciuill respect, as they haue dignitie and dominion giuen
to them ouer others: as all Magiſtrates &amp; Gouernours, in whom
there is a reſemblance of Gods Soueraigntie: in which reſpect
they beare Gods Image,Pſal. 82. 6. and are ſtiled Gods, and Sonnes of the
moſt High.
               
               
                  In a ſpirituall respect,
                  Rom. 8. 15, 16. as God through his grace hath adopted
ſome to be his ſonnes: and by his Spirit begotten them anew.Ioh. 1. 12, 13.
               
               Though out of the fatherhood of God here meant, that relation
which the firſt perſon in Trinitie hath to the ſecond, may
not be excluded (for they who apprehend not God to be a Father
of Ieſus Chriſt, cannot in faith, and with comfort call vpon
him) yet it hath eſpeciall relation to his creatures, who ſay, Our
Father, and among them to ſonnes of men ſince their fall, who
ſay,Deum patrem eſſe voce propria consitentes de conditione ſerui
                     
                        ••

ſuch as are adopted of God, and borne anew after his Image,
who onely in truth ſay to God, Hallowed be thy name, &amp;c. Thus
we who with our owne voyce confeſſe God to be our Father,
do profeſſe our ſelues to be taken from ſeruile condition into
the adoption of ſonnes.
               Many other more magnificent titles might haue bene attributed
to God,

                     . Iſa. de Orat. Cap. 18. but none more pertinent to Prayer then this title
Father, Chriſt therefore vſually in hisMath. 11. 25. Iohn 12. 27. Iohn 17. 1. Math 26▪ 39. Luke 23. 34, 46. Prayer vſed it.

applied to God import.
               
                  Q. VVHat inſtructions may be gathered from this title Father,
applyed to God in Prayer?
               
                  A. 1. God is to be called vpon in the mediation of Chriſt. In

Chriſt onely is God a Father:Galat 4. 4. and in Chriſt onely are we adopted,
and borne againe.1. Pet. 1. 3. Out of Chriſt God is a terrible Iudge,
and a conſuming fire▪ This title therefore includeth Chriſt, and
faith in him.1. Pet. 1. 3. Thus Saint Peter firſt had an eye to Gods fatherhood
in relation to Chriſt his onely begotten Sonne, and then
in relation to the Saints his adopted ſonnes.
               2. They onely haue this priuiledge to approach by Prayer into
Gods preſence, who can in truth call him Father: which none can
do but they that beleeue in Chriſt. For as many as receiued him,
to them he gaue power to become the Sonnes of God, euen to them
that beleeue in his Name.

                      1. 12. To them onely will God reach out
his golden Scepter of Grace,Eſter 5. 2. as Ahaſhueroſh did to Heſter.
                  1▪ Cor. 1. 2.
They therefore by a kind of propertie are ſaid to call vpon
God.
                  Acts 9. 14.
               
               3. Prayer muſt be made in confidence of Gods fatherly loue.

ſhall they elſe call him Father?
                  Gal. 4. 6. 
                  Becauſe ye are ſonnes (ſaith the
Apoſtle) God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Sonne into your hearts
crying Abba Father. Now the ground of this confidence reſteth
onely in Gods Fatherhood. For here are no other motiues, either
from our ſelues or from others. ButMath. 7. 11. 
                  Paternitie promiſeth
all bleſſings.
               4. There is ground of returning to God after we haue gone from
him. For a father is readie againe and againe to receiue.Luk. 15. 18. &amp;c. 
                  I will
riſe and go to my FATHER, ſaith the Prodigall: and when that
Father ſaw his ſonne yet a great way off, he had compaſſion. After
that Dauid had iuſtly baniſhed his ſonne Abſolom,
                  2. Sam. 13. 39. 
                  he longed to
goe forth vnto him. As Fatherhood promiſeth all bleſſings, ſo all
forbearance. It maketh one readie to giue, and forgiue. A fathers
loue is of all others moſt conſtant and immutable.Pſal. 103. 13▪
                   Though
he be prouoked to correct,Heb. 12. 5, 6. yet will he not forget to loue.
               5. There is ſufficient encouragement againſt euery thing,
                  1. King. 19. 12. 13. 
                  that may
any way diſhearten vs from approaching into Gods preſence: whether
it be excellencie in God, or infirmitie in our ſelues. A father
will lay aſide in his childes preſence,Quando patrem deum dicimu
                        •
                     , quaſi filij Dci agere debemus. Cypr. de Orat. Dom. §. 8. whatſoeuer may diſhearten
him.
               6. They who call on God muſt beare a child-like affection to him.
For they who with their lips call God Father, and in their
hearts reſpect him not as a Father, do apparently mocke him.

On this ground ſaith God to his people:Mal. 1. 6. 
                  If I be a Father where
is mine honour?
                  1 Pet. 1. 17. and Saint Peter, If ye call him him Father, paſſe
the time of your ſoiourning here in feare.

will prouoke vs to ſeeke both his fauour and his honour: how
to be accepted of him, and how to pleaſe him. This anſwerable
diſpoſition is a maine end of the relation betwixt God and vs.
And when he commandeth thee in prayer to call him Father,
this he willeth thee, that by a diuine courſe of life thou ſhouldeſt
be like thy Father.
               
                  Thus much of the title Father. The manner of expreſſing it followeth,
in the vocatiue caſe and ſecond perſon.
               
            
            
               §. 9. Of the prerogatiue of Gods children to ſpeake
vnto him face to face.
               
                  Q. VVHat doth the manner of expreſſing this title Father,
in the vocatiue caſe and ſecond perſon import?
               
                  
                     
                        A. 1. A dignitie of Gods children.
                     2. A dutie of Gods children.
                  
               
               
                  Q. What is that dignitie?
               
                  A. Such a familiaritie with God, as face to face to ſpeake to
him. For this title, Father, is ſo ſet downe as directed to God
himſelfe in his owne preſence. Dauid doth excellently ſet forth
this priuiledge,Pſal. 38. 9. where he ſaith, Lord I powre my whole deſire before
thee. All haue not this libertie: as an euidence where of they
haue not abilitie thus to come into Gods preſence, They vpon
whom God powreth the Spirit of grace,
                  Zach. 12. 10. he powreth alſo the
Spirit of ſupplication: but vpon no other. It is therefore a gift appropriated
to the Saints, to call vpon God in faith: by whichActs 9. 14. ſtile
they are deſcribed. Others may vſe this word,1. Cor. 1. 2. and with their
lips ſay to God,2. Tim. 2. 19. 
                  ô Father: but their ſuppoſed prayers are but
meere iip-labour. At the beſt their inward deſires are but wiſhes.
Now there is a great difference betwixt wiſhing and praying.
                  Differences betwixt wiſhing and praying. A
wiſh may intimate ſome ſence of that which a man wants, and
ſome deſire of hauing it: but ſmall care in vſing the meanes to
get it, and leſſe faith in obtaining it. But the faithfull prayers
of the Saints argue Sence, Deſire, Care, Faith and all. Balaam
                  
could with and ſay,Num. 23. 10. 
                  Let me die the death of the righteous. Like
to whom were they that ſaid,Pſal. 4. 6. 
                  Who will ſhew vs any good? But
Dauid goeth directly to God, and thus expreſly prayeth to
him, LORD life thou vp the light of thy countenance vpon vs. We
know that any man may in any place wiſh and ſay, I would the
King would grant me this or that ſute: but at all times to haue a
free acceſſe to the Kings preſence, and to ſay vnto him, O my
Leige I beſeech thee grant me this ſute, is a great priuiledge, appertaining
onely to Kings fauourites: and ſo much the greater
when there is aſſurance of preuailing by this free acceſſe: as
there is aſſurance by that free acceſſe which Saints haue to
Gods preſence.
               This is little conſidered of them, who make all their prayers
rather by exhortation vnto Prayer, then by expreſſe Petition, in
the third perſon, thus, Let vs pray that God would do this or that:
which argueth too light an eſteeme of the forenamed priuiledge:
and is a declaration of what ought to be done, rather
then an actuall performance thereof.
            
            
               §. 10. Of their dutie who haue free acceſſe to God.
               
                  Q. VVHat is the Dutie that is expected of ſuch as haue
the forenamed free acceſſe to God?
               
                  A. That in Prayer eſpecially their heart be
ſtrucke with a due reſpect of Gods preſence.Reuetence in Prayer. For then they ſtand
face to face before him. This followeth as a iuſt conſequence
from the foreſaid dignitie. When dutifull children or loyall ſubiects
ſtand in the preſence of their Father or Soueraigne, they
will manifeſt all the due reſpect they can: eſpecially when they
make a ſute to them. Should not we the children and ſubiects
of God do it much more?

               Thus much of the relatiue title Father. The correlatiue is noted
in this particle OVR. In handling whereof firſt we are to conſider in
generall the parties which are compriſed vnder it: and then more
particularly, the perſon, and number wherein it is expreſſed.

                  Q. VVHom doth this correlatiue particle (OVR) ſet out?
               
                  A. Mortall men that liue on earth.
               
                  Q. What is hereby giuen to be vnderſtood?
               
                  A. The loue of God, and honour of thoſe mortall men.
               
                  Q. How is Gods loue ſet forth?
               
                  A. By vouchſafing to be a Father to ſuch baſe wretches.Gods loue to man in vouchſafing to be called Father by them.
There is an infinite diſparitie betwixt God and man. God is a
Lord of incomprehenſible Maieſtie, and perfect puritie. Man
in regard of the mould whence he came, and whither be muſt
returne is but duſt:Quanta domini indulgetia, quan
                     
                        •

                   and in regard of the corruption of his nature
is worſe then the bruteſt beaſt, and moſt vnreaſonable creature.
May we not then on this ground with an holy admiration ſay,
Behold what manner of loue the Father hath beſtowed vpon vs, that
we ſhould be called the ſonnes of God! Who durſt call God Father,
if Chriſt had not warranted vs ſo to do.
               Q. What is the honour that is hereby done vnto the ſonnes of
men?
               
                  A. The greateſt that can be. For what greater honour then
to be the Kings ſonne?1. Ioh. 3. 1. 
                  Dauid thought it a great matter to be
Sauls ſonne in law (yet was Saul but a King on a ſmall part of
the earth,An honour to call God father. and Dauid was then annointed to be his ſucceſſour.)
What is it then to haue the King of heauen to be our Father?1. Sam. 18. 18.
This is farre more then to be an Angell, who is but a meſſenger
and ſeruant.Heb. 1. 14. 
                  Are they not all miniſtring Spirits, ſent forth to miniſter
for them, who ſhall be heires of ſaluation?
               
               Herewith may all they who haue this honour vouchſafed
vnto them,1. Cor. 4. 13. vphold themſelues againſt that vile eſteeme wherein
the world hath them. What need they care for the worlds
deſpiſing of them,1. Ioh. 3. 1. who haue God to be their Father? For this
cauſe the world knoweth vs not, becauſe it knoweth not our Father.
               
               This of the parties whoſe Father God is. The manner of applying
Gods fatherhood by the firſt perſon OVR followeth.
            
            
               
               §. 12. Of applying Gods Fatherhood to our ſelues.
               
                  Q. VVHat do we acknowledge by this correlatiue particle
OVR, as it is the firſt perſon?
               
               
                  A. That God is not onely the Father of Chriſt,
and of other men but our Father alſo:Math. 26. 39. as if one praying alone,
and for himſelfe ſhould ſay as Chriſt did,Iohn 20. 28. 
                  O my Father: and, as
Thomas ſaid to Chriſt, my Lord and my God.
               
               If it be obiected, that that which is vttered in the plurall
number is not particularly applyed to ones ſelfe: I anſwer, that
though it be not applyed to ones ſelfe onely, and alone, yet it
may be to him ioyntly with others. Though I beleeue God to
be a common Father of many (which the plurall number implyeth)
yet that hindreth not, but that I may reckon my ſelfe
in that number: and ſo make the application to my ſelfe. Thus
much is fitly axpreſſed in this ſpeech of Chriſt,Iohn 20. 1
                        •
                     . 
                  I aſcend to my
Father, and to your Father. Here he acknowledgeth God to be
a common Father of others (in theſe words your Father) and yet
maketh a particular application thereof in theſe words, my
Father.
               
               
                  Q. What inſtruction ariſeth from this application of Gods Fatherhood
to our ſelues?
               
                  A. A particular perſwaſion of Gods fatherly affection to our ſelues
is then especially requiſite when we pray vnto him.Math. 26. 39.—27. 46. We cannot in
truth ſay vnto him, our Father, without ſuch a perſwaſion.
               The benefits of that particular perſwaſion are great and manifold.Benefits of a particular perſwaſ
                        •
                     on of Gods fatherly mind. For
               1. It diſtinguiſheth the ſound faith of true Saints from the
counterfeit faith of formall Proſeſſors and trembling faith of
Diuels.1. It is a note of true faith. They may beleeue that God is a Father, but they cannot
beleeue that God is their Father,Iam. 2. 19. and therefore they beleeue
and tremble.
               
               2. It maketh vs more boldly to come to the throne of Grace.2. It miniſtreth boldneſſe.
When the prodigall child knew not to whom to go (though
he could not be ignorant that there were many fathers in the
world) he,Luke 15. 18. remembring that he had a father of his owne, ſaid, I
will goe to my MY Father.
               
               
                  
3. It maketh vs to reſt vpon God more confidently for prouiſion
for all things needfull,3. It worketh confidence. and protection from all things
hurtfull.Quid non det filijs petentibus, cum hoc ipſum ante dederit vt filij eſſent. Aug. de Ser. Dom. in mon. lib. 2. For this particular relation of Gods fatherhood to vs,
ſheweth that God taketh an eſpeciall care of vs, to whom the
promiſe of Gods care eſpecially belongeth.
               4. It doth much vphold vs in all diſtreſſes.4. It vpholdeth in diſtreſſe. With this particular
perſwaſion did the Iewes vphold themſelues when they
ſeemed to be forſaken.Iſa. 63. 16. Yea herewith did Chriſt vphold himſelfe
in his greateſt agonie.Math. 26. 39.—27. 46.
               
               5. It ſtrengtheneth our faith in all the properties and works
of God.5. It ſtrengthneth faith. For to belieue that it is my Father that hath made all
things, and doth continue to vphold and order them: that it is
my Father that is the fountaine of all bleſſing, and giueth what
he will, to whom he will: that my Father is euery where preſent,
knowing all the neceſſities and extremities of euery one: that
the mightie, mercifull, wiſe, prouident God is my Father: to be
truly perſwaded hereof muſt needs miniſter much comfort at
all times, in all places, whatſoeuer our preſent condition be. But
otherwiſe, to know that by God the whole world is ordered,
that his eyes are in euery place, that he is omnipotent, iuſt, wiſe,
true, &amp;c. and not to apprehend him to be our Father, cannot
but much ſtrike our hearts with much terror, and make vs to
flie from him, as Adam did,Gen. 3. 8. when he heard the voice of God in
the garden.
               6. It affordeth much comfort againſt our manifold infirmities.6. It bringeth comfort.
For it aſſureth vs that God will take no aduantage againſt
vs for them: but will rather accept of our poore endeauour: and
when we cannot pray as we ſhould, he will put deſires into
our hearts, and words into our mouthes. A childs owne father
will accept of any manifeſtation of his minde and meaning: yea
and ſay to him, Doeſt thou not meane this? wouldest thou not haue
that?
               
               7. All that can be ſaid of Gods fatherhood will bring no
comfort to a man,7. No comfort without it. vnleſſe he can apply it to himſelfe. Children
do not go to a man for the things they want, becauſe he is a Father
of other children: but becauſe he is their owne father.
               As the manner of expreſſing the correlatiae particle OVR in the
firſt perſon, whereby he that maketh the Prayer is included was

obſeruable: ſo is it alſo in the plurall number, whereby it is extended
to others?
            
            
               §. 13. Of Gods impartiall reſpect to all his children: and
ſufficiencie of bleſsing for all.
               
                  Q. VVHy is the application of God fatherhood ſet downe
in the plurall number, OVR?
               
               
                  A. To ſhew that God is a common father of all
the Saints:
                  God the Father of all Saints. euen of the whole Church, and of euery particular
member thereof.Epheſ. 4. 6. As there us one God, ſo that one God is father
of all. To which purpoſe is that emphaticall interrogation
of the Prophet,Mal. 2. 10. 
                  Haue we not all one Father? Wherefore not onely
the whole Church in generall, or publicke aſſemblies, but
euery particular Saint is taught to ſay, Our Father.
               
               
                  Q. What doth this teach vs?
               
                  A. 1. Gods respect to vs.
               2. Our dutie one to another.
               3. The priuiledge of Saints.
               
                  Q. How is Gods reſpect manifeſted?
               
                  A. 1. By his impartiall fauour to all alike.
               2. By the abundance of bleſſing which he hath, euen ſufficient
for all.
               1. Concerning Gods impartiall reſpect,God carieth an equall reſpect to all. Chriſt here teacheth
all, of what degree ſoeuer, to ſay to God, Our Father. God
then is the Father of all: and as a father he carrieth himſelfe towards
all.Pſal. 86. 5.—145. 14. 
                  He is good, and mercifull, and of great kindneſſe, to all
that call vpon him. He vpholdeth all that fall.
                  Acts 10▪ 34. In this reſpect eſpecially
is he ſaid to haue no respect of perſons.
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . That title therefore
which noteth out an onely ſonne on whom all loue is caſt,Math. 3. 17. and
by a propertie is attributed to Chriſt the onely begotten Sonne
of God,
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . that very title is attributed to all the Saints, to ſhew,
that though they be many,Epheſ. 5. 1. yet ſo impartiall is Gods affection
to them all, and to euery of them, as if they were all but one
onely child of God.Heb. 12▪ 23. On which ground they are all called Firſt-borne,
                  Rom. 8. 17.
                  Heirs,
                  Reue. 1. 6. 
                  Kings, and ſuch other names as do ſet forth an
equall reſpect of God vnto them all.1. Cor. 12. 12. Yea they are all one Bodie,
                  
and one Spouſe of Chriſt the Sonne of God.Epheſ. 5. 3
                        •
                     . If the ground of this
impartiall reſpect be well weighed, the truth of it will more
clearely appeare. For it wholly reſteth in God himſelfe, and
proceedeth from his free grace, and meere mercie: and not from
any gifts or parts that are in the Saints. If it did depend on any
thing in the ſonnes of men, then might it be partiall, as the loue
of earthly parents is.
               2.God hath abundance of bleſſing for all. Concerning the abundance of bleſſing which this our cōmon
Father hath, it appeareth to be ſufficient for all, in that Chriſt
directeth all to go to him, and that for others as well as for
themſelues: and not feare to put him in mind that he is the
Father of others as well as of our ſelues, and that he hath others
to bleſſe as well as vs. So as God is not like Iſaack,
                  Gen. 27. 33. &amp;c. who had
but one bleſſing, and hauing therewith bleſſed one ſonne, could
not bleſſe the other.Pſal. 36. 9. He is as a ſpringing fountaine which euer
remaineth full, and continueth to ouer-flow, though neuer ſo
much be taken out of it. Men that are very charie in keeping
ſtanding ponds priuate to themſelues, ſuffer ſprings to flow out
in common for others. Thus doth Gods Fatherly bountie flow
out to all that in faith come to partake thereof. Did not Saints
know and beleeue as much, they would vrge and preſſe all the
euidences they could of Gods Fatherly reſpect to them in ſpeciall
(as Eſau did to Iſaack,
                  Gen. 27. 32. ſaying, I am thy ſonne, thy firſt
borne, bleſſe me, my father) rather then make mention of his common
fatherhood.
            
            
               §. 14. Of their mutuall duties which ſay
OVR FATHER.
               
                  Q. VVHat are the duties on our part to be performed by
reaſon of Gods common Fatherhood?
               
                  A.
                  All make themſelues equall. 1. Great ones muſt make themſelues equall to
them of the lower ſort. Though in outward priuiledges they be
greater then other Saints,Rom. 12. 16. yet ought they as brethren to reſpect
the meaneſt, becauſe God is their Father alſo. Who greater in
the Church then Apoſtles? yet they accounted, and called the
meaneſt their brethren: which they learned of Chriſt their

maſter,Math. 23. 8. who expreſly told them, that they were all brethren.
Yea Chriſt himſelfe (though he were head and Lord of all) was
not aſhamed to call them brethren.
                  Heb. 2. 11. Is it not intollerable arrogancie
to ſcorne to account him thy brother, whoſe Father
God is, as well as thine? Such inſolent perſons cannot in truth
ſay, Our Father.
               
               2. Meane ones muſt be content in their eſtate:
                  All content in their eſtate. and that becauſe
God is their Father, as well as the Father of the greateſt.
Though in ſome outward reſpects they be meaner then others,
yet in the greateſt prerogatiue, which is to be a child of God,
they are equall to the greateſt.Galat. 3. 28. 
                  There is neither bond nor free,
but all are one in Chriſt Ieſus. A ground of great contentment.
               3. Saints muſt take occaſion of praying together.
                  Pray together. So ſhall they
moſt fitly ſay to God, Our Father. This is the rather to be noted,
becauſe Chriſt hath promiſed his preſence after au eſpeciall
manner,Math. 18. 19. 
                  Where two or three agree together.
               
               4. Saints muſt pray one for another.
                  Pray for one another. For Chriſt hath ſo ordered
this Prayer, as thereby in vſing it, wee are put in mind one of
another.Pacis doctor at
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      vnitatis magiſter ſingillatim noluit precem fieri, vt quis cum precatur, proſe tantū precetur. Cypr. de Orat, dom. §. 5. The teacher of peace and maiſter of vnitie would not
haue Prayer ſo ſingly made, as when one prayeth, he ſhould
pray onely for himſelfe. By this mutuall interceſſion of one for
another, as we acknowledge God a common Father, according
to the ſcope of this phraſe, Our Father: ſo we profeſſe him to
be the fountaine of all bleſſing, able to helpe all: euen others as
well as our ſelues: which is a great honour done to God. And
we do alſo hereby profeſſe that we are willing and deſirous
that others ſhould partake of the ſame bleſſings that we craue
for our ſelues: of which mind was that Prophet that ſaid,
Would God that all the Lords people were Prophets:
                  Num. 11. 29. and that Apoſtle
that ſaid,Acts 26. 29. 
                  I would to God that all that heare me were ſuch as
I am. Note euery of the Petitions which we are taught to make
for our ſelues, and ye ſhall obſerue euery bleſſing craued for
our ſelues, to be craued alſo for others, as theſe two words, vs,
OVR, expreſſed in euery of them doth plainly ſhew.
               There is a double bond to binde vs hereunto: one of loue, the
other of iuſtice. Chriſt noteth it to be the dutie of loue to pray
for others:Math. 5. 44. and the Apoſtle noteth duties of loue to be a due
debt.Rom. 13. 8. Herein lyeth a maine difference betweene Faith and

                  Loue. Faith is as an hand cloſed, graſping all for it ſelfe. Loue
is as an hand opened readie to communicate what it hath to
others. Whereas therefore in our Beliefe, in the ſingular number
each one ſaith, I belieue, in Prayer each one ſaith in the
plurall, Our Father, giue vs, forgiue vs, deliuer vs.
               5.Pray in loue. 
                  Saints muſt pray in brotherly loue, and with hearts and
minds vnited. This phraſe, Our Father, putteth them in mind
of a brotherly affection one towards another. To this purpoſe
may be applied that conſequence, which on ſuch a ground the
Prophet inferreth,Mal. 2. 10. in theſe words, Haue we not all one Father?
Why do we deale treacherouſly euery man againſt his brother?
               
            
            
               §. 15. Of the Saints participation of one
anothers Prayers.
               
                  Q. VVHat is that priuiledge of the Saints that is gathered
out of this phraſe, Our Father?
               
               A. They mutually partake of the benef
                        •
                     is of one
anothers Prayers. For it may well be taken for grant, that this
forme being preſcribed by Chriſt,Publica eſt nobis &amp; communis oratio: &amp; quando oramus, non pro vno ſed pro toto populo oramus, quia totus populus unum ſumus. Cypr. de Orat. Dom. §. 5. they in whom the Spirit of
Chriſt is, do accordingly vſe it: and ſo pray for all whoſe Father
God is. For this is a publicke and common Prayer: and when
we pray, we pray not for one, but for the whole Church, becauſe
we are all one. A great priuiledge this will appeare to be,
if the benefit of Prayer be rightly diſcerned. And a great comfort
it muſt needs be to ſuch weake ones, as cannot pray as they
deſire. The priuiledge of the Communion of Saints, in nothing
more appeares, then in the mutuall participation of one anothers
prayers.
               
                  Q. May not God be called vpon in the ſingular number thus,
My Father.
               
               
                  A.
                  A Saint may ſay to God, my Father. Yes: in priuate by one alone he may, ſo did Chriſt. Saint
Paul alſo did in ſuch a manner giue thanks vnto God. Yea thus
we are directed by the Prophet to call vpon God,Math. 26. 39. and to ſay,
My Father.
                  Phil. 1. 3. Yet may not one ſo apply in particular Gods Fatherhood
to himſelfe,ler. 3. 4, 19. as to appropriate it to himſelfe: nor yet
to be vnmindfull of others in his prayers, contrary to the ſcope

of expreſſing this relation in the plurall number, OVR. This
forme is not ſet downe to binde vs ſo ſtrictly to the words or
ſyllables, as neuer to ſwerue from them: but it is ſet downe rather
to teach vs what to aime at in the manner and matter of
our prayers.
               
                  Q. May this forme (Our Father) be vſed by one alone?
               
                  A.
                  One alone in Prayer may ſay, Ou
                        •
                      Father. Yes. So did Daniel, euen then when alſo being alone he
vſed the ſingular number. O our God, ſaith he, heare the
Prayer of thy ſeruant.
                  Dan. 9. 17, 18. And in the next clauſe, ô my God, encline
thine eare. In regard of that particular affiance which he had in
God, he ſaith, my God: and in regard of his reſpect, euen when
he was alone, to other children of God, he ſaith, Our God. For
our loue to the brethren, and our perſwaſion of their vnion in
Chriſt, muſt be manifeſted to God when we are alone as well
as in companie.
               Thus much of Gods Goodneſſe. It remaineth to ſpeake of his
greatneſſe.
            
            
               §. 16. Of Gods being in heauen.
               
                  Q. HOw is Gods greatneſſe ſet forth?
               
                  A. By his manſion place which is in heauen. A
manſion place is an vſuall meanes of greatneſſe or meaneſſe.
When we ſee a little thatcht ruinous cottage, we imagine that
he is a poore meane perſon that dwelleth there. Thus Eliphas
ſetteth out the baſeneſſe of men,Iob 4. 19. who dwell in houſes of clay,
whoſe foundation is in the duſt. But if we ſee a faire and ſtately
Pallace, we thinke that he is a great perſonage that inhabiteth
there. Great Nebuchadnezzar did thus ſet out his owne greatneſſe,Dan. 4. 30.
                  Is not this great Babylon that I haue built for the houſe of
the kingdome, and for the honour of my maieſtie? Yea if beggars
ſee but a faire porch before the doore of an houſe, they conceit
that one which can ſpare them ſomething there abideth. To
our capacitie therefore the Lord (who dwelleth in the light that
no creature can approach vnto) is pleaſed thus to ſet forth his
greatneſſe▪
                  1. Tim. 6. 16. glorie, and magnificence.
               Many do ſo peruert this deſcription of Gods greatneſſe, as

thereby they much impeach the excellencie of his Maieſtie.
For
               1.God is not circumſcribed in heauen. Some thence inferre that God may be circumſcribed, and
compaſſed in a place: which is contrary to his infinite greatneſſe,Ier. 23. 23.
by reaſon whereof he is ſaid to fill heauen, and earth: to
haue the heauen for his throne,
                  Math 5. 34, 35. and the earth for his foot-ſtoole:
to be euery where,Pſal 139. 7, &amp;c. ſo as none can withdraw themſelues from
his preſence:
                  1. King. 8. 27. yea to be ſo incomprehenſible, as the heauen, and
heauen of heauens cannot containe him.
               
               2.Heauen hinders not Gods ſight. Others thence inferre, that he is ſo high as he cannot ſee
the things below:Iob 22. 12, 13, 14 which Eliphas noteth to be the mind of the
prophane in his time, who ſay, Is not God in the height of heauen?
How doth God know? Can he iudge through the darke cloud?
Thicke clouds are a couering to him, that he ſeeth not: and he walketh
in the circuit of heauen. But this conceipt is directly contrary
to that omniſcience and perfect ſight of God, which the
holy Ghoſt thus ſetteth out:Pſal. 102. 19. 
                  Out of heauen doth the Lord behold
the earth.
                  Prou. 15. 3. 
                  The eyes of the Lord are in euery place, beholding the euill
and the good.
                  Heb. 4. 13. 
                  There is not any creature that is not manifeſt in his
ſight,
                  Gods prouidence on things below. 
                  &amp;c.
               
               2. Others thence inferre, that thought it be granted that God
ſeeth the earth, &amp; all things done thereon, yet he ordereth them
not:Apud Cicer. lib. 5 de Nat. Deorum, Cotta negat Deū curare ſingulos homines, aut ciuitates, aut nationes. which was the conceipt of many Philoſophers: A conceipt
directly contrary to that excellent diſcourſe which God
himſelfe had with Iob, and to the euidences of Gods prouidence
extending it ſelfe to the ſmalleſt things, as to all kinde of
creatures, euen to little ſparrowes: to the haires of our head:
and to the graſſe of the field.Iob 38. &amp; 39. &amp; 40. &amp; 41.
               
               But to let paſſe all ſuch falſe, erroneous, abſurd, and blaſphemous
collections,Math. 10. 29, 30. &amp; 6. 30. know that this placing of God in heauen
is not properly,God ſaid to be in heauen. but comparatiuely, and reſpectiuely to bee
taken: and that to giue vs occaſion to conceiue ſomething of
Gods excellencie,1. To make our ſoules ſoare vp. which is in truth vnconceiueable, and incomprehenſible.
               
                  Q. Why is God thus ſet forth?Cum deum dicit eſſe in coelis à terris abducit ornatem▪ &amp;c. Chryſ. Hom. 20. in Mat. 6.
               
               
                  A. 1. To make our ſoules aſcend as high as poſſibly can be
when we pray vnto him. Aboue heauen our thoughts cannot
aſcend. Therefore he is ſaid to be in heauen, which is the higheſt

place of all.Pſal. 123▪ 1. 
                  I lift vp mine eyes to thee who dwelleſt in heauen, ſaith
the Pſalmiſt.
               2. To diſtinguiſh God from earthly parents:2. To put difference betweene God and earthly parents. and to ſhew
that he is farre more excellent then they: euen as heauen is
higher then the earth: and things in heauen more excellent
then things on earth. No Kings or Monarchs, though they
ſhould rule from one end of the earth to the other, can be like
to our Father which is in heauen.Pſal. 113. 5. 
                  Who is like to the Lord our
God who dwelleth on high?
               
               3. To ſhew that he is free from all earthly infirmities:3. To ſhew Gods immutabilitie. and
from that changeableneſſe whereunto things on earth are ſubiect.
In heauen there is no corruption, dim
                     •
                  uution, or alteration.
Much leſſe can there be any ſuch thing in him, who is
the chiefeſt of all in heauen;Iam. 1. 17. and with whom is no variableneſſe,
nor ſhadow of turning.
               
               4. To ſet him forth in the moſt glorious manner that can
be.4. To declare his excellencie. As Kings are moſt glorious in their thrones, ſo is God in
heauen,
                  Math. 5. 34. which is his Throne. In heauen it is, where the Angels
behold the face of God:
                  Math. 18. 10. and where thouſand thouſands minister
vnto him,
                  Dan. 7. 10. 
                  and ten thouſand thouſands ſtand before him. In heauen
is Chriſt ſet at the right hand of the Throne of Maiestie. In heauen
it was where Saint Paul heard vnspeakable words,
                  Heb. 1. 3. &amp; 8. 1. 
                  which it is
not lawfull (or poſſible) for man to vtter.
                  2. Cor. 12. 4. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . In a word, in heauen
truly and properly are the things which eye hath not ſeene,
                  1. Cor. 2 9.
                  nor eare heard, nor haue entred into the heart of man.
               
               5. Becauſe his glorie is moſt manifeſted as in heauen,5. To ſhew whence his glorie moſt ſheweth it ſelfe. ſo
from heauen. For from heauen eſpecially the glorie of his power,
prouidence, iuſtice, mercie, and other attributes is declared.
The heauens declare the glorie of God. From heauen did God
cauſe iudgement to be heard.
                  Pſal. 19. 1.—76. 8. 
                  From heauen the wrath of God is re
                     
                        •
                     ealed.
From heauen did the Lord behold the earth,
                  Rom. 1. 18. 
                  to heare the
groaning of the priſoners,
                  Pſal. 102. 19, 20. 
                  &amp;c. From aboue is euery good giuing, and
euery perfect gift.
                  Iam. 1. 17.
               
            
            
               §. 17. Of the direction which Gods being in heauen giueth
vs for the manner of praying.
               
                  Q. DOth this deſcription of Gods greatneſſe giue vs any direction
for Prayer?
               
                  
                  A. Yes. Both for the Manner and Matter of Prayer.
               
                  Q.
                  No image of God to be conceiued i
                        •
                      prayer Exod. 20. 4. What direction doth it giue for the Manner of Prayer?
               A. 1. That in Prayer we conceiue no Image of God. For whereunto
can he, who is in heauen, be reſembled? It cannot but
much impaire the ſurpaſſing excellencie of Gods glorious Maieſtie,
to be likened to any creature: and that much more then
if a great Monarch ſhould be ſaid to be like a toade, or viper.
Oft and earneſtly hath God fore-warned his people to take
heed thereof:Deut. 
                        •
                     . 15. &amp;c. and much conteſted againſt them for it.Iſa. 40. 18 &amp;c. This one
point of palpable idolatrie, if there were no other, is enough to
keepe vs from communion with Papiſts.
               2.No carnal thing to be conceiued of God. 
                  That we conceiue no earthly or carnall thing of God who is in
heauen. To thinke that God dealeth hardly with vs, miſiudgeth
our intents,Iob 10. 4. accepteth not our good deeds, reſpecteth perſons,
or any ſuch thing,Iob 34. 18, 19. is to conceiue a carnall thing of God. Is it fit
to ſay to a King, thou art wicked? or to Princes, ye are vngodly?
How much leſſe to him that is in heauen, that accepteth not the
perſon of Princes?
               
               3.God not to bee meaſured by mans reaſon. 
                  That we meaſure not God, his word, nor workes by the laſte
of our reaſon. He is in heauen: we on earth. This therefore is to
meaſure things heauenly with an earthly meaſure, which is too
ſcantie.Iſa. 55. 9. 
                  As the heauens are higher then the earth, ſo are my waies
higher then your waies ſaith the Lord. This is to be noted eſpecially
againſt ſuch as in their diſtreſſes, when they can ſee no
ordinarie meanes of helpe, thinke God himſelfe cannot helpe:
as the Iſraelites that ſaid,Pſal. 78. 19. 
                  Can God prepare a table in the wilderneſſe?
and like the Prince that ſaid,2. King. 7. 2. 
                  Though the Lord would make
windowes in heauen, could this come to paſſe? This alſo is to be noted
againſt ſuch as vtterly diſpaire of mercie,Gen. 4. 13. as Cain, Iudas,
and others.Math. 27. 5.
               
               4.Goodneſſe of earthly parents tranſcendently applied to God. That we apply all the goodneſſe of earthly parents to God after
a tranſcendent, and ſupereminent manner. For as the heauen is
higher then the earth, ſo great is his mercie, &amp;c. If ye being euill
know how to giue good gifts vnto your children, how much more ſhall
your Father which is in heauen,Pſal. 103. 11. giue good things to them that aske
him?Math. 7. 11. 
                  On this ground haue the Saints in former times ſaid,
Though Abraham be ignorant of vs,Iſa. 63. 16. and Iſrael acknowledge vs not,
yet thou,Iſa. 49. 15. ô Lord, art our Father, &amp;c. Can a woman forget her

                  ſucking child? yea though they may forget, yet will not I forget, ſaith
the Lord.
                  Pſal. 27. 10. 
                  When my Father and mother for ſake me, then will the
Lord take me vp. According to this tranſcendent application of
fatherly loue to God, we ought to haue our faith ſtrengthened
therein. How much comfort may ſuch Parents as are tender
ouer their children, or ſuch children as haue tender Parents, or
any other that know the tenderneſſe of earthly Parents, receiue
by this application, if they beleeue, as they ought, That Our Father
which is in heauen, is as much more tender then fathers on
earth, as Heauen is higher then earth? Yea ſuch as haue impotent
and vnnaturall Parents on earth, may vphold themſelues
through faith in their Father who is in heauen, being as a Father,
readie, and, as in heauen, able to ſupply all their neceſſities.
               5. That with all reuerence we proſtrate our ſelues before God
our Father in heauen.
                  Reuerendly bow before God. For this end, firſt a true feare of God muſt
be planted in our hearts,Pſal. 95. 3, 6. according to this patheticall wiſh of
God himſelfe,Deut. 5. 29. 
                  O that there were in their hearts a feare of me!
Then muſt this feare be manifeſted by beſeeming geſture and
words,Placendum eſt diuinis oculis &amp; habitu corporis, &amp; modo vosu. Cypr. de Orat. dom. §. 2. neither ouer-curious, nor ouer-careleſſe. Hereof wee
haue an excellent patterne in the Lords Prayer, wherein there
is admirable art (as we haue ſhewed§. 1. Eccl. 5. 2. before) and yet no frothy
curioſitie. The wiſe man, vpon the ground here noted, giueth
a like direction. His direction is this, Be not raſh with thy mouth,
and let not thine heart be haſtie to vtter any thing before God. His
ground is this, God is in heauen. As for our geſture, on a due
conſideration of the greatneſſe of God, we are exhorted to fall
downe,
                  Pſal. 95. 3, 6. 
                  and kneele before him. The Publican with all humilitie
caried himſelfe in Prayer before God:Publicanus humiliter 
                        •
                     r
                        •
                     uit, &amp; exaudiuit orantem qui humilibus ignoſcit. Cypr. ibid. §. 4. 
                  and kneele before him. The Publican with all humilitie
caried himſelfe in Prayer before God: and he who pardoneth
the humble heard his Prayer. To conclude this point, all the
reuerence both inward and outward, that poſſibly may be, is to
be manifeſted to our Father in heauen, leſt his father-hood make
vs ouer-bold. Thus ſhall we in truth ſay vnto God, Mercie is
with thee,
                  Pſal. 130. 4. 
                  that thou maiſt be feared.
               
               6. That we make no place a pretext to keepe vs from Prayer.
                  Pray euery where. For
as the heauen, and the Sunne therein is euery where ouer vs, ſo
as we cannot withdraw our ſelues out of the compaſſe thereof:
ſo much more is God in euery place ouer vs, and with vs: neither

can we withdraw our ſelues out of the compaſſe of his
preſence. We may therefore, yea we ought, (as iuſt occaſion
and fit opportunitie is offered) pray in any place. We reade of
the Saints prayers made in1. King. 8. 23. the Temple, inActs 10. 30. their owne houſes,
on theActs 10 9. houſe top, inGen. 24. 63. the open field, inLuke 6. 12. a mountaine, in
Ion. 1. 6. a ſhip, in—3▪ 2. the mid'ſt of the ſea, in—2, 1. a fiſhes bellie, inGen 24. 12. a iourney,
in2. Chron. 14. 11 a battell▪ and in ſundrie other places. This being ſo,
what need is there of going on pilgrimage to this or that ſhrine?
Is our Father which is in heauen, tied to one countrie, or to one
place in a countrie more then to another? An heatheniſh conceipt!
For the heathen imagined their Apollo, from whom they
receiued their Oracles to be at Delphi, Cuma, Dodona, and ſuch
other particular places.Pure hearts in Prayer.
               
               7.1. Tim. 2. 8. 2. Tim. 2. 19. Pſal. 26. 6. 
                  That we liſt vp pure hearts in Prayer. For heauen, where
God is on his Throne of Grace, and whither our ſoules in
Prayer aſcend, is a pure, and holy place:Reu. 21. 27. 
                  into it no vncleane thing
can enter. Beſides, from heauen can God eſpie with what minds
and hearts we come before him.Pſal. 11. 14. 
                  His throne being in heauen, his
eyes behold, his eye-lids trie the children of men. Now he can endure
to iniquitie, no hypocriſie.Pſal. 66. 18. Ioh. 9. 31. 
                  If we regard wickedneſſe, God
will not heare our Prayers.
                  Pro. 28. 9. Iſa. 
                        〈◊〉
                      15. They are abomination to him.
               8. That our Prayers be made with an holy ſubiection to Gods will:
ſaying as Chriſt,Subiection to Gods will in Prayer. 
                  Not my will be done, but thine. God being in
heauen hath an abſolute ſoueraigntie: his will muſt, and ſhall
ſtand,Mat. 26. 39. whether we will or no. But by our willing ſubiection
we make a vertue of neceſſitie:Luke 22. 42. which is a great point of
wiſedome.
               9.Pray in faith. 
                  That in faith we lift vp eyes, hands, and hearts into heauen.
Our Father on whom we call is in heauen.
                  Pſal. 123. 1. But locally in our
bodies we cannot go thither.Lam. 3. 41. Spiritually therefore, with the
wings of faith we muſt flie vp thither. Faith is the eye, hand, and
foote of the ſoule.
               10.Effectuall Prayer. 
                  That our Prayer be ſo ſent forth as they may pierce the
heauens where God is. This is to be done with extenſion not of
voice,Dcus non vo
                        •
                     is, ſe
                        •

                        ••
                     dis auditor eſt. Cypr. de Orat. dom. §. 3. but of Spirit. The ſhrilleſt ſound of any trumpet cannot
reach vnto the higheſt heauen: no nor the ſtrongeſt report of
any canon. But ardencie of ſpirit can pierce to the Throne of
Grace. Such a Prayer was that which Moſes poured out when

God ſaid,Exod. 14. 15. 
                  Why CRYEST thou vnto me? The Apoſtle ſtileth
ſuch deſires as Gods Spirit raiſeth in our ſpirits,Rom. 8. 26. 
                  Groanes which
cannot be vttered.
               
               11.Pray with confidence. 
                  That we pray with confidence in Gods almightie power: beleeuing
that God is able to grant whatſoeuer we ſhall aske according
to his will.2. Chro. 14. 11. As the title Father gaue vs ground of confidence
in Gods fatherly loue: ſo this placing of him in heauen,
giueth vs as good ground of confidence in his power. Thus ſhall
we (as Abraham did) Giue glorie to God,
                  Rom. 4. 20, 21. 
                  being fully perſwaded
that what he hath promiſed he is able alſo to performe.
               
               12.Pray with courage. 
                  That we pray with courage, not fearing what any on earth
can do to hinder the fruite and ſucceſſe of our Prayers. For our
Father to whom we pray, and from whom we expect the accompliſhment
of our deſire, is in heauen, higher then all. Daniel
without queſtion did well know and conſider this ground of
confidence, when notwithſtanding the decree made againſt all
that ſhould aske any petition of any God or man,
                  Dan. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 
                  he prayed three
times a day his window being open.
               
            
            
               §. 18. Of the direction which Gods being in heauen
giueth vs for the matter of Prayer.
               
                  Q. VVHat direction doth this placing of God in heauen giue
vs for the matter of Prayer?
               
                  A. It teacheth vs what things eſpecially to aske.
               
                  Q. What are they?
               A.Aske of God matters of moment. 1. Things of weight and worth, meete for ſuch a Maieſtie
to giue. When ſubiects preferre a Petition to their Soueraigne
ſitting on his throne, or chaire of eſtate, they do not vſe to make
ſute for pins or points. This were diſhonourable to his maieſtie.
Shall we then make ſute to this higheſt Maieſtie being in
heauen, for toyes, and trifles? Shall a dice-player pray that he
may win his fellowes money? Shall an angrie man pray to God
that he may be reuenged on him with whom he is angrie? Shall
any one deſire God to ſatisfie his luſts? In this reſpect ſaith S.
Iames,
                  Iam. 4. 3. 
                  Ye aske and receiue not, becauſe you aske amiſſe that you may
conſume it on your luſts. For this generall direction about the

matter of Prayer, we haue a perfect patterne in this platforme
preſcribed by our Lord, wherein is nothing, but what is of
great moment mentioned.
               
                  Obiect. We are there taught to pray for daily bread, which
ſeemeth not to be ſo great and weightie a matter.
               
                  Anſw.
                  Vnder daily bread weightie matters compriſed. 1. Vnder bread all temporall bleſſings are compriſed.
Now all temporall bleſſings ioyntly conſidered together, are a
matter of much moment, and meete to be craued of that Lord
who is in heauen,
                  Pſal. 24. 1. and to whom the earth and the fulneſſe thereof
belongeth.
               2. We do not there onely craue the thing it ſelfe, but a bleſſing
with it. Now the bleſſing of the leaſt creature is a weighty
matter: more then all the world can giue. Without the bleſſing
the creature it ſelfe is nothing.Deut. 8. 3. For man liueth not by bread onely,
but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth
man liue.
               
               3. Though temporall bleſſings in their kinde be comparatiuely
ſmall,See §. 96. yet in their end they are of great worth. Their proper
end is to enable vs the better to do that worke which God
hath enioyned vs to do, and to honour him in this world, which
the liuing onely can do.Iſa. 38. 19. In this reſpect we are to craue them

                     om. 20. in Mat. 6. From this placing of God in heauen we are taught to
craue things heauenly: which are
               1. Such as tend to the glorie of God that is in heauen.
               2. Such as helpe vs to heauen.
               Theſe are the things which Chriſt eſpecially entendeth,
where making a compariſon betwixt our father on earth, and
this our Father in heauen,Math. 7. 11. he ſaith. How much more ſhall your Father
which is in heauen,
                  Luke 11. 13. 
                  giue good things to them that aske him? S.
Luke expreſſing the ſame point, in ſtead of good things puts the
holy Ghoſt: whereby is ſhewed what are the good things which
Chriſt meaneth, namely, ſuch as proceed from the ſanctifying
Spirit of God. Theſe heauenly things are moſt meete for him
who is in heauen to giue. To this purpoſe tendeth this exhortation
of the Apoſtle,Col. 3. 1. 
                  Seeke thoſe things which are aboue. Well had
Salomon learned this leſſon: for when God ſaid to him, Aske

what I ſhall giue thee,
                  1. King. 3. 5, 9. he anſwered, Giue thy ſeruant an vnderſtanding
heart: which is one of thoſe good gifts that come from
aboue.
               
               
                  Obiect. If the things which we are here taught to pray for
be heauenly, how is it that temporall bleſſings come in the rank
and number of them?
               
                  Anſw.
                  How earthly things are heauenly bleſſings. Math. 6. 33. As appendices, and appurtenanees to heauenly and
ſpirituall bleſſings: for ſo they are promiſed. Firſt ſeeke the kingdome
of God, and his righteouſneſſe, and all theſe things ſhall be added
vnto you. As when a man purchaſeth mannours and lands,
the wood in hedge-r
                     •
                  wes for fire-boote, plow-boote, and other
like purpoſes is giuen in the groſſe. Or more plainly, when
a man buyeth ſpice, fruite, comfits, or any ſuch commodities,
paper and pack-thred is giuen into the bargaine. So if thou get
heauenly bleſſings, temporall things, ſo farre as they are needfull
for thee, ſhall be caſt in.
               3.Aske heauen it ſelfe. From placing God in heauen we are taught to craue heauen
it ſelſfe: that we may be where our Father is: and where we may
moſt fully enioy his glorious preſence. Thus did the Apoſtle
deſire to depart,
                  Phil. 1. 23. for this very end that he might be with Christ.
And the holy Patriarkes are ſaid to deſire an heauenly countrie:Heb. 11. 16.
which alſo the Apoſtle noteth to be the deſire of all true Saints.Heb. 13. 14. V

               Two things there be which will teſtifie the truth of our deſire

walking in the way that leadeth thereto.Heb. 4. 11.

               Thus farre of the Preface. The Petitions follow.
            
            
               §. 19. Of the manner of handling euerie Petition.
               IN handling euery of the Petitions ſixe points ſhall be diſtinctly
obſerued.
               1. The Meaning of the words.
               
                  
2. The Order and dependance of one point vpon another.
               3. The particular good things which we are to cr
                     •
                  ate.
               4. The particulars for which we are to giue thankes.
               
               5. The duties which we ought to endeauour after.
               6. The failings for which we are to be humbled.
               The three former of theſe are moſt proper and naturall.
For
               1. By opening the meaning of the words, the true and full intent
of Chriſt will be better found out.
               2. By noting out the dependance, one point will giue much
light to another. For the order is very acurate.
               3. By reckoning vp the particulars which are to be craued,
we may eaſily diſcerne what abundance of matter is couched
vnder a few words.
               The other three points follow by iuſt conſequence. For
               1. Whatſoeuer we pray for, when we haue obtained it, we
muſt be thankfull for.
               2. We muſt do what we can to get what we pray for, or elſe
we mocke God.
               3. The want of ſuch things as we ought to pray for, miniſtreth
iuſt matter of humiliation.
               Theſe three latter points therefore are to be conſidered in
euery Petition as well as the former.
            
            
               §. 20. Of the name of God, and the things compriſed
vnder it.
               
                  Q. VVHich is the firſt Petition?
               
                  A. Hallowed be thy Name.
               
                  Q. What is the Name of God?
               
                  A. That whereby God is made knowne. For that is the end
and vſe of a name, to make knowne and diſtinguiſh that whoſe
name it is.Gen. 2. 19, 20. Thus did Adam giue names to euery liuing creature
to make them thereby be the better knowne; and to diſtinguiſh
them one from another. Whatſoeuer Adam called euery liuing
creature, that was the name thereof: namely a name proper and
peculiar vnto it, whereby the nature of it was expreſſed, and ſo
the creature made knowne. Thus whatſoeuer it is whereby

God is made knowne vnto vs, may be compriſed vnder this title
Name attributed to God.
               
                  Q. How many things are there whereby God is made knowne?
               
                  A.
                  Sixe things cō
                     priſed vnder Gods name. Sixe eſpecially.
               1. His Nature,
                  1. His nature. Ioh. 4. 24. which is a Spirit. Hereby we know him to be
inuiſible, and no way ſubiect to corporall groſſeneſſe or weakneſſe.
Yea hereby we know that he muſt be worſhipped in ſpirit
and truth.
               
               2.2 The diſtinctiō of perſons. Math. 28. 19. The Diſtinction of perſons in the holy Trinitie. Hereby is
Iehouah the true God diſtinguiſhed from all falſe gods. For neuer
came it into the imagination, or apprehenſion of any heatheniſh
Idolater to conceiue that his God could be one in nature,
and three in perſons. Hereby alſo may we know how to
approach vnto the Father, namely in the mediation of his Sonne
by the aſſiſtance of his Spirit.
               3.3. His titles. Vide Hieronym. in epiſt. ad Martel. His Titles. The Iewes haue ten ſeuerall titles which they
apply to God, and whereby they diſtinguiſh him from all creatures.
Among the reſt Iehouah is the moſt proper. For that is
applyed to none but to God. Theſe two titles, LORD, GOD,
are moſt vſuall in our tongue.
               That the titles applyed to God are properly his Name, is
euident by that anſwer which God himſelfe gaue to Moſes,
enquiring what he ſhould ſay if the children of Iſrael ſhould
aske what the Name of that God that ſent him, was. Gods anſwer
was this,Exod. 3. 14. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   say, I AM hath ſent me to you. By the forenamed
titles is God diſtinguiſhed from all creatures.
               4.4. His properties. His Attributes. Of theſe ſome are incommunicable, ſo proper
to God as in no reſpect they can be attributed to any creature:
as eternitie without beginning, ſimpleneſſe without mixture,
infiniteneſſe filling all places, preſcience, knowing all things
before all times, immutabilitie not ſubiect to any change, all-ſufficiencie
in himſelf, omnipotencie and ſuch like. When we heare
any of theſe to be attributed to any, we may thereupon inferre,
ſurely that is God, or elſe they are falſly attributed. Other attributes
are indeed communicable, and in ſome reſpects may be
applyed to creatures, as puritie, wiſedome, truth, iuſtice, mercie,
and others ſuch like, yet in that they are originally, infinitely, vnchangeably
in God, they declare that God to be Iehouah, the ſupreme

Lord of all. Such as theſe were reckoned vp, when the
Lord proclaimed his Name to Moſes.
                  Exod. 34. 5, 6, 7.
               
               5.5. His word. His Word. This of all other doth moſt clearely, diſtinctly,
and fully make God knowne vnto vs. Chriſt ſpeaking of
the holy Scriptures thus ſaith,Iohn 5 39. 
                  They are they which teſtifie of
me.
               
               6.His workes. His Workes. For the inuiſible things of God from the creation
of the world,
                  Rom. 1. 20. 
                  are clearely ſeene, being vnderſtood by the things that
are made,
                  Nomen eius gloria eius. Bern. in Quadrageſſ. Serm. 6. 
                  euen his eternall power and Godhead. Gods workes do
euidently declare him to be God, yea to be the onely true God,
infinitely wiſe, iuſt, mercifull, powerfull, &amp;c. In a word, Gods
name is his glorie.
            
            
               §. 21. Of Gods making knowne himſelfe.
               
                  Q. VVHat learne we from this mention of Gods Name?
               
               
                  A. God may be knowne. Though he be inuiſible,
vnconceiueable, incomprehenſible in himſelfe,
and in his diuine eſſence, yet it hath pleaſed him to ſet
forth himſelfe according to our capacitie, as is euident by all
thoſe places where mention is made of his name.
               
                  Q.
                  God maketh himſelf knowne Why hath God taken a name to be knowne by?
               
                  A. 1.To make vs reſpect him. To worke in our hearts a due reſpect of him. Who
will or can reſpect that which he knoweth not? But the name of
God is in euery reſpect glorious. It therefore maketh them that
know it to reſpect him.
               2.To draw vs to him. To ſhew vs how we may draw neare vnto him, call vpon
him, truſt in him, and receiue from him all needfull bleſſings. If
he had no name, or were no way knowne of vs, how could we
ſeeke him, and find him? Thus he hath aimed both at his owne
honour, and our good, in taking a name to himſelfe. Wherefore
we ought to enquire after the name of God, and to take
notice of all thoſe meanes whereby he hath made himſelfe
knowne to vs. That ſo we may the better hallow his name.
               
               Thus much of this word Name. About the other word (Hallowed
be) we will firſt conſider the meaning of it, and then the manner
of ſetting it downe: and that 1. Imperſonally. 2. In forme of Petition.
            
            
               
               §. 22. Of Hallowing.
               
                  Q. VVHat doth this word HALLOW ſignifie?
               
                  A. Properly to make holy: being all one as to
ſanctifie. But it is diuerſly vſed in the Scriptures.
               It is attributed ſometimes to things that are to be made holy,
and ſometimes to things that are alreadie holy in themſelues.
               Things to be made holy are hallowed two waies.
               1. By ſetting them apart, or imploying them to an holy vſe.
This may be done by one creature to another. For thus God
commandeth Moſes to ſanctifie or hallow all the firſt-borne.
                  Exod. 13. 2, 12. And
to ſhew his meaning herein, he ſaith a little after, Thou ſhalt ſet
apart vnto the Lord all that openeth the matrix. Thus do miniſters
hallow the bread and wine at the holy Communion.
               2. By putting holineſſe actually and properly into that which
is hallowed. This the Creator onely can do to his creatures.
The Apoſtle therefore thus prayeth,1. Theſ. 5. 23. 
                  The very God of peace ſanctifie
you wholly. And this God doth by his Spirit, which is thereupon
called the holy Ghoſt, and Spirit of ſanctification.
                  Math. 28. 19.
               
               That which is holy in it ſelfe is ſaid to be hallowed by eſteeming,Rom. 1. 4. acknowledging,Nos ipſos admo nemus deſiderare vt nomen eius quod ſemper ſanctum eſt, 
                        •
                     tiam apud homiues ſanctum habeatur. Aug. cp. 121. Iſa. 29. 23. and declaring it to be as it is. In which
ſence ſaith the Lord, They ſhall ſanctifie my name, and ſanctifie
the holy one of Iaakob. To ſanctifie an holy one can import no
more then (as was ſaid) to eſteeme, acknowledge, and declare
him to be holy. This is all the hallowing, or ſanctifying that can
be done to the Creator. This therefore muſt needs be here
ment.
               
                  Q. Why is choice made of
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      ſanctificetur. a word that ſetteth out Gods holineſſe,
rather then any other of his attributes?
               
                  A. Becauſe holineſſe is in it ſelfe an eſpeciall excellencie, and
alſo the perfection of all other excellencies. If holineſſe could
be ſeucred from any of Gods attributes (which is impoſſible
that it ſhould be: for as ſoone may God ceaſſe to be God, as to
be holy) it might then be ſaid thereof, as it was ſaid of Iſrael
when the Arke was taken away,1. Sam. 4. 21. 22. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   
                  where is the glorie.
               
            
            
               
               §. 23. Of the creatures hallowing the Creator.
               
                  Q. VVHat learne we from the deſire of hallowing Gods
name?
               
                  A. The Creator may be hallowed by his creatures: otherwiſe
Chriſt would not haue taught vs to make this Petition; neither
would there haue bene ſo many exhortations recorded in Scripture
to this purpoſe, as there are▪
               
               This is not done by the creatures conferring of any thing
vpon his Creator, but onely by the Creators gratious acceptation
of our acknowledgment of him to be as he is.Iob 22▪ 2, 3. &amp; 35. 7. For if thou
beeſt righteous what giueſt thou to him? or what receiueth he at
thine hands? God is ſo abſolute and perfect in himſelfe, as do
the creature what it will, it can no way increaſe the honour of
God, no nor darken and obſcure it. His name is holy in it ſelfe,
whatſoeuer we ſay for it,
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   or againſt it. Neither is it needfull in
regard of the Creator that his name ſhould be hallowed: but in
regard of the creatures it is very needfull. For the creatures
hallowing of Gods name maketh nothing to the happineſſe of
the Creator hallowed,Cyril. Catech. myſt. 5. but much to the happineſſe of the creature
hallowing.Vt ſanctificetur nomen dei non deo ſed hominibus prodeſt. Aug. epiſt. 121. Should no creature hallow his Creators name,
the Creator were not the leſſe honourable: but the creature that
failed therein much more miſerable.
               Behold here the admirable goodneſſe of God to man, who
accepteth of that which is in himſelfe, as giuen to him by man.
Perfectly and infinitely holy he is, and yet vouchſafeth to bee
hallowed. Ought not this gratious acceptation of God to moue
vs to deſire, and to do the things wherein, and whereby God
is hallowed?
            
            
               §. 24. Of the excellencie of Holineſſe.
               
                  Q. VVHat is taught vs by the expreſſe mention of hallowing
in this Petion?
               
                  A. Gods chiefeſt glorie conſiſteth in his holineſſe.
Reade the Scriptures obſeruantly, and ye ſhall find this attribute
moſt vſually applied to him. They who beſt know how

moſt to glorifie God, do reſound this one to another, Holy, Holy,
Holy, is the Lord.
                  Iſa. 6. 3.—40. 25. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   Yea by a propertie and excellencie is God
ſtiled the Holy one.
               
               Take heed therefore that no thought which may any way
impeach Gods Holineſſe paſſe from you: but let your heart giue
aſsent,Rev. 4. 8. and your tongue ſay Amen to this diuine dittie of that
heauenly Quire, Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God Almightie. So acknowledge
him to be in all his counſels,1. Pet. 1. 15, 16. Fieri dici

called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of conuerſation, becauſe
it is written, Be ye holy, for I am holy?
               
            
            
               §. 25. Of the extent of mans deſire to haue Gods
name hallowed.
               
                  Q. VVHat learne we from the manner of ſetting downe
this dutie in the third perſon indefinitely, thus, hallowed
be.
               
               
                  A. Our deſire of hauing Gods name hallowed, muſt be beyond
that which we are able to do by our ſelues. The extent of
our deſire in this reſpect muſt reach to all creatures, in all places,
at all times. For this purpoſe reade Pſal. 113. 2, 3, 4. and
the whole 148. Pſalme. This ſheweth that in this our deſire
we ſimply aime at Gods glorie: and that we reſpect the honour
of God more then the reward that may redound to vs
thereby. If our deſire were reſtrained to our ſelues, that we
onely might hallow the name of God, not caring whether it
were hallowed by others or no, it might iuſtly be thought that
the chiefe,Exod. 32. 32. if not the onely end of our deſire were ſome recompence
which from thence we expected to our ſelues. Moſes manifeſted
a pure zeale of Gods glorie when he could haue bene
contented to be blotted out of Gods booke, rather then Gods
name ſhould be diſhonoured.
            
            
               §. 26. Of mans diſabilitie to hallow Gods Name.
               
                  Q. VVHy is this ſet downe by Petition thus, hallowed be,
rather then by promiſe, thus, hallowed ſhall be.
               
               
                  
                  A. Becauſe it is not in our power to do it of our ſelues. For
we are not ſufficient of our ſelues to thinke any thing as of our ſelues:
                  2. Cor. 3. 5. Nulla ſacit homo bona, quae non deus praeſtat, vt faciat homo. Aranſ. Concil. cap. 10.
                  our ſufficiencie is of God. God therefore worketh in man that abilitie,
mind and will which he hath to hallow Gods name: ſo as
in truth it is God that in and by vs halloweth his owne name.
            
            
               §. 27. Of the force of this word THY in the
firſt Petition.
               
                  Q. TO whom is this particle, THY, to hereferred?
               
                  A. To him that is deſcribed in the Preface.
               
                  Q. What doth it note out?
               
                  
                     
                        A. 1. A reaſon of the Petition.
                     2. A reſtraint of the Petition.
                     3. An emphaſis of the Petition.
                  
               
               
                  Q. How a reaſon?
               
                  A. As it hath relation to the two properties of him that is
deſcribed.God to be hallowed becauſe he is good and great. He is Our Father, and he is in heauen: a good and a
great God; a gratious and a glorious Lord. Is there not then
good and great reaſon that his name be hallowed?
               
                  Q. How a reſtraint?God onely to be hallowed.
               
               
                  A. By implying that Gods name onely is to be hallowed.Pſal. 148. 13. 
                  I
am the Lord:
                  Iſa. 42. 8. (ſaith this God:) that is my name, and my glorie
will I not giue to another. And as God will not, ſo neither muſt
we giue that which is due to him, to our ſelues or others: on
which ground the Pſalmiſt thus prayeth,Pſal. 115. 1. 
                  Not vnto vs,
                  Ezec. 28 2, 7. 
                  ô Lord,
                  Dan. 5. 20, 21.
                  not vnto vs,
                  Acts 12. 22, 23. 
                  but vnto thy name giue glorie. Tyrus, Nebuchadnetzar,
Herod, and many others haue bene ſeuerely reuenged for
vſurping that glorie to themſelues which was due to God.
               
                  Q. How doth this particle THY,
                  God to be hallowed aboue all ſet out an emphaſis?
               
                  A. By implying that the name of God is to be aduanced aboue
all names. As if we thus ſaid, Thy name, be hallowed as
becometh ſo great a name,Pſal. 113. 4. whoſe glorie is aboue the heauens.
Thus this particle THY, directing our heart to our Father in
heauen, maketh it to ſoare aloft, and extendeth the deſire
thereof.
            
            
               
               §. 28. Of mans honouring God, becauſe God
honoureth him.
               
                  Q. VVHat is to be obſerued about the order of the firſt Petition?
               
                  A. 1. The fit inference of it vpon the Preface.
               2. The due precedence which it hath before all other Petitions.
               
                  Q. What learne we from the inference of it vpon the Preface?
               
                  A. 1. The honour which God vouchſafeth to man ſhould
moue man to ſeeke the honour of God.
               2. Sonnes of God ought eſpecially to ſeeke the honour of
God.
               The firſt of theſe is a generall Doctrine,Digna prorſus 
                        •
                     o qui eum patrem appellauit oratio, nihil omnino prius quam pro illius gloria ſupplicare. Chryſ. in Mat. 6. Hom. 20. ariſing from that
prerogatiue which God in heauen vouchſafeth to men on earth,
namely, to be their Father. Whence is inferred, as a dutie, their
deſire of hallowing Gods name. To this end is a like Preface
prefixed before the Decalogue. In that Preface are laid downe
the fauours of God to his people, and thereupon obedience to
all Gods commandements (whereby God is much honoured)
is required. This dutie of honouring God, vpon the forenamed
ground of Gods honouring man, is much inculcated by Moſes
and the Prophets.
               Both Iuſtice and Gratitude require as much. Iuſtice, becauſe
it is a due debt. Gratitude, becauſe it is a rcall acknowledgment
of kindneſſe receiued.
               We ought therefore to take notice of thoſe ſpeciall fauours
and honours which God doth to vs: that our hearts may be the
more ſtirred vp thereby to ſeeke his honour.
            
            
               §. 29. Of Saints honouring God, becauſe they
are ſonnes.
               THe other Doctrine ariſeth from the particular kinde of honour
noted in the Preface, which is, to be ſonnes of him
that is in heauen. Becauſe he is our Father, and we his ſonnes,

therefore we eſpecially ought to ſeeke his honour.Mal. 1. 6. 
                  If I be a Father
(ſaith he) where is mine honour? God doth moſt expect it at
his ſonnes hands, as of right he may. For they are honoured
with the greateſt honour that can be. Can there be a greater
honour conferred on ſonnes of men, then to be ſonnes of God?
Conſider this all ye that call God Father: eſpecially, ye into
whoſe hearts God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Sonne crying,
                  Gal. 4. 6.
                  Abba Father.
                  In filiorum ordinem profecti, pro patris noſtri gloria to
                        •
                     um impendamus affectum, dicentes, ſanctificetur nomen tuum. Ab. Iſa. de Orat. c. 18. We that are in the ranke of Gods children ought
wholly to apply our ſelues for the glorie of our Father, ſaying,
Hallowed be thy Name.
            
            
               §. 30. Of preferring Gods honour before all
other things.
               
                  Q. VVHat learne we from the precedence of this Petition?
               
                  A. 1. Gods honour ought to be preferred before
all things.
               2. Gods honour is the maine end whereat all our deſires
ought to aime.
               The order of the Decalogue and the placing of the firſt commandement
before all the reſt, doth confirme the former of
theſe inſtructions:Mat. 6. 33. ſo doth this exhortation, Firſt ſeeke the kingdome
of God. All priorities are compriſed vnder that particle,
Firſt.
                  Ioh. 12. 27, 28. Both before and aboue all things is that to be ſought.
Chriſt preferred his Fathers glory before his owne life: yea,
and before freedome from that bitter agony whereunto he was
brought, being our Suretie▪ For thus in his prayer he reaſoneth
about that point: What ſhall I ſay? Father ſaue me from this
houre. Bnt for this cauſe came I vnto this houre. Father glorifie thy
name. And then he reſteth, as in that which aboue all he deſired.
This mind by the ſame Spirit was wrought in Saint Paul,
who counted not his life deare:
                  Acts 20. 24.—21. 13. but was readie to dye for the name
of the Lord.
               
               
                  Q. Is Gods honour to be preferred before our eternall ſaluation?
               
                  A. 1. Theſe two cannot ſtand in oppoſition.Our ſaluation ſtandeth with Gods honour. The more we
ſeeke Gods honour, the more we helpe forward our ſaluation:
and the more we ſeeke our ſaluation aright, the more wee aduance
Gods honour.
               
                  
2. If they could ſtand in oppoſition,Gods glory to be preferred before our ſaluation. then without contradiction
Gods honour ſhould be ſought rather then our owne
ſaluation. On which ground Moſes made this tranſcendent
Prayer,Exod. 32. 32. 
                  If not, blot me I pray thee, out of thy booke which thou haſt
written.
               
               Gods glorie is of all things the moſt excellent,Eccl. 7. 1. and pretious.
If a mans name be better then pretious ointment,Pro. 22. 1. and great riches,
What is Gods?
                  Hee primum fieri petionus quod maximum, vt nobis gloriae illius innoteſcat ſanctitas illibata Bern. in Quadr. Serm. 6. Now the more excellent a thing is, the more
it is to be eſteemed, and preferred. Beſides by ſeeking and ſetting
forth Gods honour, we ſeeke and ſet forth our owne. For
as it is in it ſelfe an honorable thing to honor God, ſo God that
can and will performe it, hath ſaid, Them that honour me will I
honour. Is there not then good reaſon to deſire aboue all other
things that Gods name be hallowed?1. Sam. 2. 30.
               
            
            
               §. 31. Of aiming at Gods honour in all things.
               THat Gods honour is alſo the maine end whereat all our
deſires ought to aime, is euident by that pertinent exhortation
of the Apoſtle,1. Cor. 10. 31. 
                  Whatſoeuer you do, do all to the glorie of
God.
                  Phil. 1. 20. This was his reioycing, that the Lord ſhould be magnified in
him,
                  Rom. 9. 22, 23. 
                  whether it were by life,
                  Eph. 1. 6. 
                  or by death. God himſelfe maketh his
glorie the end of all his counſels and actions.Pro. 16. 4. But that end
which he aimes at we alſo muſt ſet before vs. As for this end, it
is the higheſt, chiefeſt and beſt end whereunto any thing can be
referred. It is the end of this firſt Petition, &amp; of all the reſt: for
the perfection of Gods kingdome, and ſubiection to his will
tende directly to his glorie. As for the other three Petitions,
though in the matter of them they concern our good, yet in the
manner of ſeeking our good, namely of God, they make to Gods
glorie. For in the fourth Petition Gods prouidence in the things
of this life is acknowledged: in the fift his mercie in pardoning
ſinne: in the ſixt his power, in keeping ſafe from all aſſaults.
               This may ſerue as a touch-ſtone to trie the ſoundneſſe of a Religion.Our religion giueth more glorie to God then poperie.
In oppoſition betwixt diuerſe religions, marke which
cometh neareſt to this marke, nnd moſt tendeth to this end. If
the religions of Proteſtants and of Papiſts be well touched with
this touch-ſtone, and equally poiſed in theſe ballances, it will

eaſily be found that the reformed Religion is much more ſound
then the other. For one maine difference betwixt vs and them
in all our controuerſies, is this, that we take away from man all
manner of glorying in himſelfe, and giue the glorie of all to
God. But they rob God to giue to man matter of truſting vnto
himſelfe, and vnto others like himſelfe, and of boaſting in himſelfe
and others. Inſtance the controuerſies we haue with them
about the authoritie of the Church aboue the Scriptures, The power
of Popes and Prieſts, Adoration and Inuocation of Angels and
Saints, Their interceſſion, The inherent vertue of Sacramtes, Mans
free-will to good, Workes of ſatisfaction and ſupererogation, Merit
of workes, Indulgences, Pilgrimages, and many other like
theſe.
               This alſo may ſerue as a touch-ſtone to try particular actions.
The more they aime at this end the better they be. Though
a worke ſeeme otherwiſe neuer ſo good, yet if Gods glorie be
not the end of it, it onely ſeemeth to be good, as that which
ſeemeth to be what it is not. To giue almes, to pray, to faſt, are
workes in the generall matter and ſubſtance of them good, yet
in theſe Chriſt cenſured the Phariſes,Math. 6. 1. &amp;c. and warned his Diſciples
not to be like them: and that becauſe they miſſed of this end.
Let vs therefore in all things aime eſpecially at Gods glorie.
            
            
               §. 31. Of the particulars to be prayed for vnder
the firſt Petition.
               
                  Q. VNto how many heads may thoſe particulars which in the
firſt Petition we are taught to pray for, be referred?
               
                  A. Vnto three eſpecially. For we are taught there to deſire:
               1. Such graces in our ſelues as may enable vs to hallow the
name of God.
               2. Such graces in others as may enable them thereto.
               3. Such an ouer-ruling prouidence in God, as may direct
euery thing thereto.Particulars prayed for in regard of our ſelues.
               
               
                  Q. What are the graces which we deſire for our ſelues to the
foreſaid end?
               
                  A. Such as are requiſite for euery power of our ſoule, and

part of our body to make them fit inſtruments of hallowing
Gods name: as
               1. For our vnderſtanding,
                  1. Knowledge of God. we deſire knowledge of God: that
(as the Apoſtle prayeth) God would giue to vs the Spirit of wiſedome
and reuelation in the knowledge of him.
                  Epheſ. 1. 17. This wee may the
more confidently pray for,Ier. 31. 34. becauſe it is abſolutely promiſed;
and we ought the more earneſtly to deſire it, becauſe it is the
groundworke of all other graces. Before the vnderſtanding be
well enlightned, neither can the will be made ſubiect to God,
nor the heart ſet vpon God, nor any other power of ſoule or
part of body be ſeruiceable to him.Mat. 6. 22, 23. expounded. 
                  The light of the bodie is the
eye: that is, the vnderſtanding in man, the little world, is as that
great light the Sunne in the great world. If therefore thine eye
be ſingle thy whole bodie ſhall be full of light. If the vnderſtanding
be well illuminated and do clearely diſcerne the truth, the
whole man throughout will be well ordered. But if thine eye
be euill, thy wholebody ſhall be full of darkneſſe. If the vnderſtanding
be blind, the whole man muſt needs be out of order. The
knowledge here deſired,How God is to be knowne. ought to be a particular and diſtinct
vnderſtanding of all the things whereby God is made knowne
vnto vs: as of his Nature, Perſons, Titles, and Attributes: yea
alſo of his Word whereby all theſe, together with his whole
will are plainly reuealed: and of his ordinances, wherein and
whereby he is worſhipped: and finally of his workes, whereby
his wiſedome, power, iuſtice and mercie, are euidently made
knowne.2. Acknowledgment of God. Reu. 4. 11. Yea further we ought to deſire that knowing God to
be the onely true Iehouah, we may acknowledge him to bee
worthie of all honour, as the celeſtiall ſpirits do.
               2. For our Will,
                  3. Subiection of our will to Gods we deſire a thorow and full ſubmiſſion of it
to God, as to our ſoueraigne Lord. Hereof we haue a worthy
patterne in Eli,
                  1. Sam 3. 18. 
                  Dauid, and Chriſt himſelfe. Hence will follow
Patience vnder all croſſes,2. Sam. 15. 26. as laid vpon vs by God.Math. 26. 39. Contentment
in our eſtate,4. Patience. as appointed to vs by God. Thankfulneſſe for euerie
bleſſing,5. Contentmēt. as beſtowed vpon vs by God, and other like vertues,6. Thanfulnes.
which as they haue reſpect to God do make much to the
hallowing of his name.
               3. For our Mind and Will ioyntly together,7. Faith. we deſire Faith,
whereby we giue all due credence to the truth of Gods word,

and beleeue in him.Ioh. 3. 33. This is a great honour done to God: for he
that receiueth his teſtimonie, hath ſet to his ſeale that God is true.
Vnder this head is compriſed affiance in Gods mercie,
                  8. Affiance. wherein
the glorie of God doth moſt brightly ſhine forth:Pſal 108. 4. (for his mercy
is great aboue the heauen:
                  9. Confidence.) Confidence in Gods power,
                  Rom. 4. 20. whereby
Abraham gaue great glorie to God:10. Truſt. 
                  Trust in Gods prouidence, a
point much preſſed by Chriſt:Math. 6. 25. &amp;c. 
                  Perſwaſion of Gods diuine wiſedome,
wherby all things are turned to the glorie of Gods name:11. Perſwaſion of Gods wiſedome.
and other vertues of the like kind, whereby Gods name is alſo
much hallowed.
               4. For our Heart we deſire that it may be wholly ſet vpon
God:12. Loue. and that he may be made the obiect of all our liking affections,13. Ioy.
to loue him with all our heart,
                  14. Delight. 
                  with all our ſoule,
                  15. Care. 
                  with all
our mind:
                  16. Zeale. to ioy in the holy Ghoſt: to delight in his word: to care
how to pleaſe him:
                  Math. 
                        •
                     2. 37. and to be eaten vp with a zeale of his glorie.
And on the other ſide we deſire that our diſliking affections be
ſet on that which diſliketh him,Rom. 14. 17. as to hate ſinne and obſtinate
ſinners which are hatefull to him:Pſal. 119. 77. to feare his diſpleaſure:1. Cor. 7. 32. to
grieue at his offence:Joh 2▪ 17. and to tremble at his iudgements.Pſal. 139. 21.
               
               5. For our Speech,
                  Pſal. 119. 120. we deſire to mention the name of God,
as we haue occaſion,Pſal 102. 9, 10. 
                  with all reuerence: yea and to take all occaſions
of ſpeaking of the glorie of his name:2 Chro. 34. 27. for in this reſpect
eſpecially is our tongue,17. Sanctified ſpeech. by an excellencie, called glorie. We deſire
therefore (when in truth,
                  Deut. 28. 58. 
                  righteouſneſſe and iudgement it may
be done) to ſweare by his name:Pſal. 45. 1. to call vpon his name; to praiſe
his name:Pſal. 57. 8. to declare his name to others, and to inſtruct them
therein,Ier. 4 2. that ſo the name of God may be the more hallowed:Pſal 50. 15, 23.
yea aboue all to vſe our glorie,Pſal. 22. 22. our tongue in maintaining the
truth of God,1. Pet. 3. 15. and in making a iuſt Apologie when queſtion is
made thereof.
               6. For our life and outward actions,18. Holy life. we deſire that they be
holy, just,Math 5. 16. and blameleſſe, that men may ſee our good workes and
glorifie our Father which is in heauen.
                  Ioh. 15. 8. 
                  Herein (ſaith Chriſt) is my
Father glorified,
                  2. Cor. 8. 19. 
                  that ye beare much fruite: and S. Paul noteth
workes of mercie to tend to the glorie of the Lord.
               
               
                  Q. What graces do we deſire for others to the hallowing of Gods
Name?Like graces deſired for others.
               
               
                  A. All thoſe which we are to deſire for our ſelues: that

Gods name may be hallowed by others as well as our ſelues:
which we are to deſire, not onely for our children, families,
kindred, neighbours, country-men, or ſuch as we are by outward
bands bound vnto, but indefinitly for all of all ſorts:
whereof we haue a worthy patterne in the 67. Pſalme. Thus
ſhall we ſhew that in this our deſire we aime more at Gods

good of ſuch as are any way deare vnto vs.
               
                  Q. What things do we deſire that God by his ouer-ruling prouidence
would turne to the hallowing of his Name?Pray that all things may make to Gods glorie.
               
               
                  A. Euery thing whatſoeuer: as
               1. The vertues of his Saints,1. Cor. 8. 1. whereby elſe they may bee
puffed vp.
               2. The peace and proſperitie of his Saints,2. Chro. 26. 16. whereby elſe they
may be drawne away from God.
               3. The failings and folly of his Saints,Gen. 50. 20. as he did turne the
enuie of Ioſephs brethren to the accompliſhment of his word.
               4. The troubles and croſſes of his Saints,Phil. 1. 20. that they ſinke not

enemies of his Church.
               6. All that all creatures do;Pſal. 148. &amp; 150. that thus in all places, at all times,
in and by all things, the Name of God may be hallowed.
            
            
               §. 32. Of the particulars for which thankes is to be
giuen vnder the firſt Petition.
               
                  Q. TO what heads may thoſe particulars, for which by reaſon
of the firſt Petition we ought to giue thankes be, referred?
               
                  A. To the ſame that the particulars which we ought to
pray for, were referred: which are
               1. All things whereby we our ſelues are enabled to hallow Gods
Name: whether in our ſoule, as theEpheſ. 1. 3. gifts and graces thereof:
or in our bodie, asIſa. 38. 19, 20. health, ſtrength, agilitie, and dexteritie to
any thing that maketh to that end:1. Tim. 1. 12. or in our calling,1. Chro. 29. 12, 13. whether

our outward eſtate.
               2. All things whereby others are enabled to hallow Gods Name:1. King. 10. 9.
                  
                  and that in their ſoule, bodie, calling, or eſtate.
               
               3. All euents that any way make by the ouer-ruling prouidence
of God to the hallowing of his name: as
               
               1. All manner of bleſſings beſtowed on his Churches and
children.Pſal. 147. 1 &amp;c.

               3. Prouidence manifeſted in and vpon any creatures.Pſal. 145. 1, 15.
               
            
            
               §. 33. Of the duties required by reaſon of the
firſt Petition.
               
                  Q. TO what heads may the duties, which by reaſon of the firſt
Petition we are bound vnto, be referred?
               
                  A. Vnto two eſpecially. One whereof reſpecteth our ſelues.
The other reſpecteth others.
               Q. What are we bound vnto in regard of our ſelues?
               
                  A. To make the beſt vſe that we can of all the meanes which
God affordeth to enable vs to ballow his Name, by giuing vs
knowledge of God, bringing our wills in ſubiection to him,
drawing our hearts vnto him, and breeding and increaſing any
of the forenamed graces in vs. For this end we ought
               1. So to behold the creatures,Behold God in his creatures. and meditate on them, as we
may diſcerne the ſtamp of God in them, and the euidences
which they giue of his wiſedome,Iob 42. 5. power, iuſtice, mercie, prouidence,
&amp;c. By this meanes did God bring Iob to a more full
knowledge, and a more reuerend reſpect of his diuine Maieſtie
then he had before.Pſal. 8. 1. &amp;c. 
                  Dauid alſo by this meanes had his heart
euen rauiſhed with an holy admiration of God.
               2. To take more diſtinct notice of God in and by his word.Know God by his word.
The Scriptures are they that teſtifie of God.Ioh. 5. 39. And becauſe for
our helpe the Lord hath ordained and ſanctified the preaching
of his word (a powerfull meanes to breed and increaſe in vs all
thoſe graces whereby we may be the better enabled to hallow
Gods name) we ought diligently to attend to it.Speake of Gods glorie.
               
               3. To take all occaſions of ſtirring vp our glory (as Dauid
ſtileth our tongue) to ſpeake of,Pſal. 57. 8. and to ſpread abroad the glorie
of Gods name:Pſal 40. 9, 10. yea and to be willing to open our eares to

them that are readie to ſpeake of the ſame ſubiect: and by our
mutuall conference to miniſter more and more matter thereabouts.
               4. To order the whole courſe of our life,Honour God by thy life. Col. 1. 10. ſo as it may bee
worthy of the Lord, and a meanes to bring honour to his
name.Math. 5. 16.
               
               
                  Q. What are we bound vnto in regard of others?Bring others to honour God.
               
               
                  A. To do our vttermoſt endeauour to draw on others to
hallow Gods name:
                  Pſal. 34 11. For this end we ought
               1.Pſal. 22. 22. To inſtruct ſuch as are ignorant of God in the knowledge
of God.Acts 18. 26.
               
               2. To draw them to ſet their whole heart on God,Deut. 6. 4, 5. by commending
to them the greatneſſe and goodneſſe of God, ſo as
they may be enamoured therewith.
               3. To encourage them to all good workes whereby God is
glorified.
            
            
               §. 34. Of the things to be bewailed in regard of
the firſt Petition.
               
                  Q. VVHat are we to bewaile in regard of the firſt Petition?
               
                  A. 1. Whatſoeuer is any way defectiue and wanting
to the honour of God, ſo as, if it were more compleate, God
might be more honoured thereby: As the elder Iewes which
had ſeene the firſt Temple built by Salomon,
                  Ezr. 3. 12. when they ſaw the
foundation of the ſecond Temple laid, wept with a loud voice,
becauſe that latter Temple was not ſo faire as the former. Thus
if the brightneſſe of the Goſpell ſhine not forth ſo brightly, as
it hath done formerly, or if any other way the glorie of God be
obſcured, it miniſtreth iuſt matter of much humiliation.
               2. Whatſoeuer bringeth diſhonour to Gods glorious
name, as All manner of ſinnes committed againſt any of the
foure commandements of the firſt Table▪ vnder which head
may bee compriſed:
               
                  Pſal. 10. 4. &amp; 14. 1. 1. Atheiſme: which is an vtter denying of God.
               2. Ignorance of the true God;
                  Gal. 4. 8. This makes men transferre

the honour of God vpon others.2. Theſ. 1. 8. Againſt ſuch therefore
will Chriſt come in flaming fire.
               3. Errors of God. As when the vnitie of his nature, 
                     •
                  rinitie of
perſons, perfection of power, mercie, iuſtice, wiſedome,
truth, or any other attributes are denied: or when God is
in any meane reſpectPſal. 50. 21. 1. Sam. 15. 29. made like to man, or to any other
creature.
               4.1. Sam. 2. 30. 
                  Light eſteeme of God: as when he is not truſted in, feared,
loued, obeyed with all the mind and might.
               5.Mal. 1. 10. 
                  Neglect of due worſhip: or yeelding falſe or careleſſe
ſeruice to him.

                  Vndue vſing of his Name, as abuſing the ſame by raſh
ſwearing, for-ſwearing, blaſphemie, &amp;c.
               7.Pſal. 119. 136. Prophaneſſe, and all manner of impietie.
               
               8.1. Sam. 8. 7. 
                  Contempt of his image in ſuch as he hath ſet ouer vs. Theſe
and ſuch like tend directly to his diſhonour.
               To this head may be referred all ſuch ſinnes as make men attribute
to others, or arrogate to themſelues that which is
due to God. Baſe flatterie and fooliſh admiration make
ſome to deifie others: as theActs 12. 22. Tyreans did Herod. Selfe-conceipt,
pride and arrogancie make others to deifie themſelues:
                     •
                  
                  l Ezek. 28. 2.
as Tyrus did.

members of the Church, which cauſe the name of God
to be blaſphemed.
               4. The euill euents which follow from any of the troubles
that befall the Church: as2. Tim. 4. 16. feare of man more then of God, denying
the truth of God, and Apoſtaſie.
               5. All the aduantages that enemies of God and of his Saints
do any way get.Pſal. 10. 13.—42. 3. Their inſultations, and curſed exprobrations,
and that againſt God himſelfe.
            
            
               §. 35. Of Gods kingdome: what it is, and what
be the kinds of it.
               
                  Q. VVHich is the ſecond Petition?
               
                  A. Thy kingdome come.
               Q. What is the kingdome of God?
               
                  
                  A. That eſtate where as a King he ruleth. For that is a kingdome
where a King raigneth and ruleth. Where God therefore
raigneth, there is his kingdome.
               
                  Q. How doth God raigne as a King?
               
                  A. 1. By his abſolute power he raigneth ouer the whole
world.
               2. By his ſpeciall grace he raigneth ouer his Church.
               According to this different manner of Gods raigning is his
kingdome diſtinguiſhed. For
               1. He hath an vniuerſall kingdome,Gods vniuersall kingdome. Vbi

                     , maieſtas eius. Bern. de verb. Iſay. Serm. 5. called his kingdome of
power: becauſe by his abſolute and ſupreme power he ouer-ruleth
all creatures whatſoeuer, or whereſoeuer they be In regard
of this vniuerſall ſoueraignty of God, the Scripture ſaith, His
kingdome ruleth ouer all. For who hath reſiſted his will? And thereupon
he ſaith vnto God,Pſal. 103 19. 
                  How terrible art thou in thy workes?
Through the greatneſſe of thy power ſhall thine enemies ſubmit
themſel

                     es to thee.
                  Rom. 9. 19.
               
               2. He hath a peculiar kingdome,Pſal. 66. 3. called his kingdome of
Grace,
                  Gods peculiar kingdome, his Church. whereby he raigneth ouer a ſelect people culled out of
the world, which voluntarily yeeld obedience vnto him. The
companie of this people, is in one word the Church: and it is a
ſocietie choſen of God,Sanè ſecundum praedeſtinationem nunquam Eccleſia electoric penes deum non ſuit. Bern. ſuper Cant. Serm. 78. redeemed by Chriſt, called and ſanctified
by the holy Ghoſt, which hath bene in all ages of the
world, ſome in heauen, others on earth ſpread ouer the face
thereof farre and neare: in which reſpects it is ſtiled the holy Catholicke
Church. This is properly the kingdome of Chriſt, in, and
by whom the Father raigneth. For it is ſaid, that a kingdome was
giuen to the Sonne of man:
                  Dan. 7. 14. Of whom ſaith the Father, I haue ſet
my King vpon my holy hill of Sion:
                  Pſal. 2. 6. whoſe people ſhall be willing in
the day of his power.
                  Pſal. 110. 3.
               
               Herein lyeth a maine difference betwixt Gods manner of gouernment
in his vniuerſall, and in his peculiar kingdome, that
the worlds ſubiection is forced,
                  Pſal. 66. 3.—110 3. but the Churches ſubiection
is free.

               TOuching that vniuerſall kingdome of God ouer all creatures

                  the ſpirit which worketh in
the children of diſobedience: and ſeeing the diuell is the god of this
world, a doubt may be made, how God can be ſaid to be their
King, and Gods kingdome thus vniuerſally extended ouer the
whole world.
               
                  Anſw. 1. Rebelion of ſubiects taketh not away the right
of a Soueraigne.Pſal. 2. 1, 6. Chriſt therefore notwithſtanding the tumult

the arch-rebell of all,Iob 1. 11.—2. 5. of all, Satan, in the caſe of Iob. Inſtance

               4. Satan to whom the fore-named rebels are ſubiect, is but
Gods executioner:1. King. 22. 2
                        •
                     . he is one of the number of Gods ſeruants,

power, which Satan hath ouer them, God ſheweth himſelfe to
be their King.
               
                  Q. Is this vniuerſall kingdome of God here ment?
               
                  A. No further then that God would order it to the good
of his peculiar kingdome, which is here principally intended.
            
            
               §. 37. Of the kingdome of Grace and Glorie.
               
                  Q. HOw may the peculiar kingdome of God be conſidered?
               
                  A. 1. In the beginning, and progreſſe of it.
               2. In the conſummation, and perfection of it.
               In the former reſpect it conſiſteth of a mixture of euill perſons
with good ones:Kingdome of Grace. and of euill qualities, in thoſe good perſons,
with good ones:Math. 13. 24.—47. in regard of which mixtures it is reſembled
to a field wherein grow tares with wheate: and to a drawnet
which gathereth of all ſorts:Mar. 4. 26. and to corne which ariſeth
with ſtraw and chaffe, as well as with ſound and ſolid graine.
               
                  
In the latter reſpect it conſiſteth onely of ſuch as are euery
way perfectly good:Kingdome of glorie. and therefore ſaid to ſhine as the Sunne,Math. 13. 41, 43.
which hath no darkneſſe,Reu. 21. 27. nor any ſpeck or ſpot in it. In the former
reſpect eſpecially, it is called a kingdome of Grace: and
that:
               1. In oppoſition to thoſe who neuer were,Why the kingdome of grace is ſo called. nor euer ſhall be
of it: and therefore are obiects of Gods ſeuere iuſtice and reuenging
power:Ier. 10. 25. but in it grace raigneth.
               
               2. For diſtinction from thoſe who are tranſlated out of it into
heauen.Rom. 5. 21. For by reaſon of the many temptations and imperfections
whereunto the Saints on earth are ſubiect, thy ſtand
in need of much more grace then the Saints in heauen, who are
iuſt and perfect.
                  Heb. 12. 23.
               
               In the latter reſpect it is called a kingdome of Glory,Why the kingdome of glorie is ſo called. and
that by reaſon of the Place, where it is, and of the Perſons,
which are of it.
               1. The Place where it is, is the moſt glorious place of all the
world: euen the higheſt heauens.
               2. The Perſons, both King and Subiects thereof are decked
with vnſpeakable glorie. The King doth there manifeſt his glorie
more then any where elſe: as brightly as can poſſibly by the
creature be diſcerned. The Subiects there partake of as much
glorie as they are capable of: and that in ſoule and body: ſo as
they are all glorious within and without.

                     ••
                  Grace. Glorie.
               THis kingdome of Grace, and of Glorie, is but one and the
ſame kingdome: diſtinguiſhed into two parts, which differ
in ſixe circumſtances.
               1. In Time. The kingdome of Grace is now preſent while
here we liue. The kingdome of Glorie is to come.
               2. In Place. This of Grace is on earth: that of Glorie in
heauen.
               3. In Condition. This is continually warfairing againſt many
enemies: in which reſpect it is ſtiled the Church militant; That

the Church triumphant.
               
               
                  
4. In Order of entring into them. This is to be entred into,
and paſſed through before we can enter into that. The Prieſt
was to enter through the Sanctuarie into the Sanctum Sanctorum.
               
               5. In the manner of Gouernment. This is gouerned and ordered
by many ſubordinate meanes, as Magiſtrates, Miniſters,
and ſundrie ordinances. That immediatly by God himſelfe.
               6. In Continuance. This hath a date, and is to come to an end.
That is euerlaſting without end.
            
            
               §. 39. Of the Churches Gouernment.
               
                  Q. VVHat learne we from this title, kingdome, here applied
to the Church?
               A. Gods Church is a well gouerned eſtate.
                  Pſal. 122. 3. Therein
is a King: a iuſt, wiſe, and potent King. No King is or can be
like to him. He can, not onely reſtraine and ſubdue his enemies,
but alſo change their hearts, and linke them to his ſubiects.
He can make the Wolfe dwell with the Lambe, &amp;c.
                  Iſa. 11. 6. &amp;c. Therein
are righteous lawes, excellent priuiledges, and all things requiſite
for a well ordered politie, all tending to the good of the
ſubiects. For it is the eſtate whereof God taketh moſt care.Exod. 19. 5.
               
               They therefore that ſeeke to take away order,Order in the Church. and to bring
confuſion into the Church, do much diſhonour this kingdome
and the King thereof,1. Cor. 14. 33. who is not the author of confuſion but peace.
So do they alſo who profeſſe themſelues to be members of the
Church,Iudg 21. 25. and yet liue as if they were without law, in no kingdome,
vnder no gouernment.
               This condition of the Church, to be a kingdome (if the King,
ſcepter, lawes, and priuiledges thereof were well knowne)
would be a ſtrong motiue to draw ſuch,Iſa. 11. 10. as are out of the Church
into it: and to retaine ſuch as are of it, in it, and to make them
ſay, It is good to be here. There is nothing worthy to be deſired in
a kingdome, but is after a moſt excellent manner in this kingdome:
as, ſufficient ſupply of all things needfull: ſafe protection
againſt all things hurtfull.
               
                  
Thus much of this title kingdome. The next word to be conſidered
is, come.
               
            
            
               §. 40. Of the encreaſe of the Church.
               
                  Q. VVHat doth this word, come, import?
               
                  A. 1. A want of perfection.
               2. A progreſſe thereto.
               The word,Cui dicitur, veni, nondum perueneral. Bern. in Cant. Serm. 25. 
                  come, is metaphoricall. That which is comming is
not where it would be: it may yet go further: and in that it is
comming, it doth ſtep by ſtep draw nearer and nearer to that
whereunto it would come: otherwiſe it did not come but ſtand
ſtill. Hereby then we are giuen to vnderſtand that the kingdome
here ſpoken of hath not yet attained to the higheſt pitch,Adueniat regn
                        ••
                      tuum, veniat vti

                     , quod perfectain eſt, &amp; euacuetur quod eſt ex parte Bern. Serm. in Nat. Mar.
and fulleſt perfection thereof. Therefore we deſire that by degrees
it may ſo proceed on thereto, as it may at length attaine
that whereunto it doth proceed: that that which is in part may
depart, and that which is perfect may be accompliſhed.
               
                  Q. To which of Gods kingdomes is this Metaphor to be applied?
               A. To his peculiar kingdome, the Church, in both the parts
thereof, militant, and triumphant. In the militant Church it is
to be extended to all that in Gods decree are deputed thereto,
whether called or not called. To ſuch as are not called, that
they may be called, and ſo come into the kingdome of grace. To
ſuch as are called that they may be more and more fitted to
come into the kingdome of glorie: ſo as it may be full and perfect
in all the parts thereof.
            
            
               §. 41. Of the Churches imperfection.
               
                  Q. WHat doctrine doth this deſire of the comming of Gods
kingdome imply?
               
                  A. Gods Church is not yet perfect. This is true
of both the parts of the Church, militant, and triumphant.
               The militant Church, whether it be conſidered in the ſeuerall
aſſemblies and congregations thereof (which conſiſt of ſuch
as are but hypocrites, as well as ſuch as are vpright) or in the
beſt of thoſe particular perſons (which make vp thoſe congregations,

and hath in them fleſh as well as ſpirit) cannot bee
denied to be imperfect: whereupon, as in regard of the mixture
of good and euill perſonsCant 2. 2. Dicuutur ſpinae propter malignitatem morum: d cuntur fili
                        •
                      propter communionem ſacramentorum. Chriſt ſaith of his Church, As
a Lilly among thornes, ſo is my loue among the daughters (Thornes
they are called for their wicked diſpoſition, but daughters for
their communion in holy things) ſo in regard of the mixture of
ſpirit and ſleſh in ſuch as are vpright; ſhe ſaith of her ſelfe,Cant. 1. 4. Poseſt ſpouſ

imperfections, as well as of her afflictions and perſecutions. For
with ſome comelineſſe there may be blackneſſe.
               The triumphant Church alſo, though in regard of that part
thereof which is in heauen, it beEpheſ. 5. 27. 
                  glorious, not hauing ſpot, or
wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, yet becauſe the combate of all that
bleſſed communion is not yet full, and the bodies of them
whoſe ſoules are in glory, yet be in the power of death, may be
truely ſaid to be imperfect. For theActs 3. 21.

waite for it.Hab. 2. 3. 
                  The viſion is yet for an appointed time: though it tarrie,
wait for it, becauſe it will ſurely come.
               
               Shall now particular Churches, which by the true notes of a
Church may be proued to be true Churches, bee denied to bee
Churches, and forſaken becauſe of ſome imperfections therein?
They who will abide in no Church but in that which is perfect,
may wander from Church to Church, and finde none on
earth to abide in. Were it not for the Churches imperfection
there would not be ſo great need of this Petition. This is thus
noted not to iuſtifie any corruption, or imperfection. For this
Petition which implyeth imperſection, enioyneth vs to pray
againſt it. And that which is prayed againſt muſt not be patronized:
but rather the beſt meanes that can be muſt bee vſed to
redreſſe the ſame.
               As not particular Churches, ſo nor particular perſons muſt
be miſ-iudged by reaſon of the imperfection of grace, or the
corruption of fleſh remaining in them. All here on earth is in
part, all is imperfect. Spirits of iuſt men made perfect are to bee
found in heauen, not on earth.Heb 12▪ 23. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   They that think themſelues perfect
are for the moſt part furtheſt from perfection. Let vs for
our parts be of the ſame minde whereof the bleſſed Apoſtle

was,Phil. 3. 12, 14. not to thinke our ſelues already perfect, but to follow hard
after perfection, and to preſſe toward the marke for the price
of the high calling of God in Ieſus Chriſt.

                  Q. VVHat learne wee from the application of this word
COME to the Kingdome of God?
               A. Man of himſelfe cannot come to Gods Kingdome. It muſt
come to him,
                  Iſa. 65. 1.

and much matter of humiliation miniſtred vnto him.

ſecond Petition.
               
                  Q. TO whom hath this particle▪ 
                  THY relation?
               
                  A. Euen to him to whom the ſame Particle had
relation in the former Potition. And it doth here import
the ſame things that it did there. 1. A reaſon. 2. A reſtraint.
3. An extent of this Petition.
               A Reaſon, as it is referred both to the Preface, and alſo to
the firſt Petition. The kingdome here meant is the kingdome
of him who is our Father, who is in heauen, and whoſe name is
to be hallowed. Great reaſon therefore that we ſhould pray for
this Kingdome to come.
               A Reſtraint, as it implyeth that this Kingdome onely ſhould
be deſired to come. So as, not any kingdome which is contrarie
to this, and hindreth the comming of this, but euery kingdome
which is any helpe to the comming of this, in that onely
reſpect as it is ſuch an helpe, ought to be deſired to come.
               
               
                  
An Extent, in that it implyeth a comming fit for ſuch a kingdome
as Gods is: yea, and anſwerable to the excellencie of him
who is the King thereof.
            
            
               §. 44. Of Gods power to make his Kingdome come.
               
                  Q. WHat learne wee from directing this Petition vnto
God?
               A. It is in the power of God to perfect his Church. He can gather
all the parts thereof together: and bring them all to that
meaſure of perfection which is meeteſt for them. Otherwiſe it
were in vaine to make this Petition to him.1. Cor. 3. 7. 
                  It is God that giueth
the encreaſe. It is he that is able to make grace to abound.
                  2. Cor. 9. 8.
               
               Let vs therefore euer call vpon him to be fauourable vnto Sion,
and to build vp the walles of Ieruſalem:
                  Pſal. 51. 18. and let vs in faith
depend on him for the good of his Church: and ſo long as hee
remaineth King thereof not feare what any creature can doe againſt
it.Pſal. 118. 6.
               
               Thus much of the meaning of the words, and inſtructions ariſing
out of them. The order and fit inference of this Petition vpon
the former followeth.
            
            
               §. 45. Of the beſt meanes, and fitteſt perſons to
hallow Gods Name.
               
                  Q. VVHy is this ſecond Petition inferred on the firſt?
               A. 1. To point out the beſt meanes of hallowing
Gods Name.
               2. To ſhew what perſons are fitteſt thereto.
               
                  Q. What is the beſt meanes?
               
                  A. The Church:Pſal. 65. 1. wherein praiſe waiteth for God. For God
is knowne in Iudah:Pſal. 76. 1. 
                  his name is great in Iſrael. No where is God
ſo well knowne as in his Church.
               
               
                  Q. Who are the fitteſt perſons to hallow Gods Name?
               
                  A. Such as are members of the Church. Them therfore doth
Dauid cal vpon to praiſe the Lord.
                  Pſal. 135. 19, 20, 21. No other perſons can hallow
Gods Name aright: for this is a worke of Gods ſanctifying
Spirit.1. Cor. 12, 3. 
                  No man can ſay that Ieſus is the Lord, but by the Holy
Ghoſt.
               
               
                  
Vpon the two forenamed grounds, we ought the more earneſtly
to pray for the Church, that ſo the Name of God may be
the more hallowed.Dan. 9. 19. This moued Daniel to bee exceeding feruent
in Prayer to God for his Church.
            
            
               §. 46. Of the ſpirituall bleſsings to be craued for the
whole militant Church.
               
                  Q. VVHat are the particular good things which by vertue
of the ſecond Petition we ought to pray for?
               
                  A. All ſuch things as concerne the good of the Church militant,
or triumphant.
               In our Prayer for the Church militant we ought to haue reſpect
to the things which concerne the whole body, or the ſeuerall
parts thereof, whether they bee more remote, or nearer to
vs, and ſo we more eſpeciall members thereof.
               
                  Q. What are wee to pray for in regard of the whole bodie of the
Church militant?
               
                  A. 1. That God would bleſſe it with all needfull bleſſings
both ſpirituall and temporall.
               2. That he would protect it from all manner of euill.
               Vnder the bleſſings craued for the Church the meanes which
God hath ſanctified for the better effecting of them are compriſed.
               
                  Q. What are the ſpirituall bleſsings which wee ought to deſire
for the Church on earth?Spirituall bleſſings for the whole militant Church.
               
               
                  A. 1. In generall that as God hath choſen it to bee as his
Vineyard and Orchard, ſo he would take an eſpeciall care of it,
hauing his eye continually vpon it, to plant it, to water it, to
fence it, to doe for it whatſoeuer he himſelfe ſeeth requiſite for
it. Becauſe we know that God better knoweth, then we doe,
what is good for his Chnrch, therefore ought our deſire of the
good thereof to be referred to him, &amp; extended to that knowledge
which he hath of it. To which purpoſe Dauid thus prayeth,
Doe good in thy good pleaſure vnto Sion.
                  Pſal. 51. 18.
               
               2. In particular we ought to deſire both the dayly encreaſe
of Gods Church on earth; and alſo the eſtabliſhment of it.
               
                  
For the encreaſe of it two eſpeciall things are to bee deſired,
and that indefinitely without any limitation to any particular
place.
               1. That where no Church is,Pray that Churches may be where none are Pſal. 67. 2. God would bee pleaſed to
plant one. Such ought the extent of our deſire to be herein, as
to pray that Gods ſauing health may be knowne among all Nations.
Eſpecially among ſuch as haue a particular promiſe made
to them,Rom. 11. 25, 26. as the Iewes.
                  Pſal. 67. 4. On this ground when they were a people,
and we none, they prayed for vs.
               2. That where any foundation of a Church is laid,Pray that Churches planted may encreaſe. God
would cauſe the building anſwerably to bee reared vp. To
which purpoſe Dauid in his forenamed prayer addeth this
clauſe,Pſal. 51. 18. 
                  Build thou the walls of Ieruſalem. This was the maine
thing which the Apoſtles aimed at in that powerfull prayer
which with one accord they made vnto God.
                  Acts 4. 24. On this ground we
haue iuſt cauſe to pray for Virginia, and other like Plantations.
               For the eſtabliſhment of the Church, two things alſo are to
be deſired.
               1. That ſuch Churches as are built vp may bee kept from
ruine:Pray for preſeruation of Churches. 1. Theſ. 3. 10, &amp;c. and the people thereof from reuolt. On this ground we
ought to pray for the Churches now in Europe.
               2. That if any breaches haue beene made, they may bee repaired,
and ſuch people as haue reuolted bee reſtored.Pray for recouerie of Churches. On this
ground wee ought to pray as for thoſe Churches of Greece,
which were planted by the Apoſtles, ſo for all thoſe Churches
which hauing receiued the light of the Goſpell,Dan. 9. 16. haue
returned

                  Q. Which are the meanes that wee ought to pray for, as
ſanctified of God for obtaining the forenamed bleſſings.
               
                  A. They are of two ſorts.
               1. Outward;
                  Outward meanes of the Churches good the ſacred ordinances of God.
               2. Inward; the ſanctifying operation of Gods holy
Spirit.
               Of outward meanes there are three eſpeciall kinds.
               1. The chiefeſt and moſt abſolutely neceſſarie is the Miniſterie
of Gods Word.
               
               2. The next to that is the administration of the Sacraments.
               
               
                  
3. The laſt, which is alſo of very good vſe, is Eccleſiaſticall
gouernment.
               
               By the Miniſterie of the Word both ſuch as are out of the
Church are gathered into it:1. The word. Pſal. 45 6.—110. 2. and they alſo that are in it, are
further built vp in all needfull graces. That is Chriſts Scepter
whereby he gouerneth his Church:Mat. 13. 19. and wherein his ſtatutes,
and ordinances,Pſal. 147. 19. and all the priuiledges of the Church are contained.
               By adminiſtration of the Sacraments that grace which is
wrought by the Word,2. Sacraments. is confirmed, and eſtablished. Theſe
are Chriſts ſeales to ratifie his Couenant,Rom. 4. 11. and all his promiſes
made vnto his Church.
               By the Eccleſiaſticall gouernment well ordered many ſcandals
and ſtumbling blockes are remoued,3. Gouernment. or auoided. Such as are
free-hearted and forward are encouraged; ſuch as are backward
and ſlothfull, are pricked on; ſuch as are vnruly, and refractarie
are bridled, and kept in compaſſe.
               
                  Q. What are we to pray for in regard of the ordinances of God?Pray for free vſe of Gods ordinances.
               
               
                  A. That they may bee freely and purely exerciſed. Pray
(ſaith the Apoſtle) that the word of the Lord may RVNNE;
(that is haue a free and a ſpeedie paſſage) and be glorified,
                  2. Theſ. 3. 1. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   that
is, be purely and powerfully preached. That which hee applyeth
to the Word, may alſo be extended to other holy ordinances
of God; which that they may be freely and purely exerciſed,Pray for Miniſters.
we are to pray both for Ministers, &amp; alſo for Magiſtrates.
For Miniſters eſpecially,Mat. 9. 38. that the Lord would ſend forth labourers
into his harueſt:
                  Epheſ. 6. 19. 
                  and giue them vtterance, that they may open their
mouth boldly to make known the myſterie of the Goſpel: ſo as Abilitie,
Libertie, and Integritie, are to be prayed for in the behalfe of
Miniſters. Of all other functions none more needful, none more
vſefull for the Church: none can leſſe be ſpared then Miniſters.
Wherefore more inſtant Prayer is to be made for them.Pray for Magiſtrates. Magiſtrates
alſo,Pſal. 49. 23. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   who are promiſed to be giuen as nouriſhers &amp; nurſes
of the Church, may by their good gouernment procure much
good to the Church, as Mordecai did. Wee ought therefore
to pray for them:Eſt. 10. 3. that God would raiſe vp men of worth, that
may feede his people according to the integritie of their heart, and
guide them by the skilfulneſſe of their hands,
                  Pſal 78. 72. as Dauid did. Where

there are none to beare rule,Iudg. 21. 25. 
                  euery man doth that which is good
in his owne eyes: whence muſt needs follow much confuſion.
And where there are euill Magiſtrates, people are oft
drawne to follow their euill courſes: witneſſe this ſtile giuen
to the firſt King of Iſrael, Ieroboam which made Iſrael to ſinne.
                  2 King. 10. 31.
If they will not follow their euill courſes, they ſhall bee ſure to
be oppreſſed. For when the wicked beareth rule,
                  Pro. 29. 2. 
                  the people
mourne.
               
               
                  Q. What ought wee to pray for in regard of the ſanctifying operation
of Gods Spirit?
               
                  A. That it may alwaies accompany all the outward
meanes ordained of God for the good of his Church.Pray for the power of the Spirit. For neither
is he that planteth any thing: nor hee that watereth: but God
that giueth the encreaſe: which hee giueth by the worke of his
Spirit.1. Cor. 3. 7. 
                  The Spirit giueth life. The Apoſtle therefore prayeth for
them that had heard the Word of Truth,
                  2. Cor. 3. 6. that God would giue
them the Spirit of wiſedome and reuelation.
                  Epheſ. 1. 13, 17. By the operation of
Gods Spirit are all Gods ordinances made powerfull and effectuall.
            
            
               §. 47. Of praying for the outward temporall
eſtate of the Church.
               
                  Q. VVHat are we to pray for in regard of the temporall
eſtate of the Church?
               
                  A. All needfull peace and proſperitie.Pſal. 122. 7, 7. Though all temporall
bleſſings be compriſed in the fourth Petition; yet ſo farre
forth as they tend to the good of the Church, being a meanes
that the Goſpell may be preached, and the Sacraments adminiſtred
more freely, that people may bee more incouraged to
come into the Church, and to abide in the Church, that Eccleſiaſticall
gouernment may be the better exerciſed, they belong
to this Petition. Yet becauſe the Church like a Palme-tree doth
oft better grow, at leaſt in purity, when it is preſſed with aduerſitie,
we are in our deſire of the outward peace and proſperitie
of the Church to ſubmit our deſire to the wiſedome of
God, and no further to deſire it, then God ſeeth it to be needfull,
and vſefull for the Church.
            
            
               
               §. 48. Of the extent of our Prayer for the good of
the Church after our time.
               
                  Q. HOw farre ought our deſire for the good of the
Church to extend?
               
                  A. To preſent, and to ſucceeding times,
that the Church of God may proſper, flouriſh and increaſe
both in our dayes, and alſo in the dayes of our poſteritie from
time to time, till the day of perfect conſummation, which
is the day of the glorious appearing of Ieſus Chriſt. For
this end wee are to pray for Seminaries of Miniſters,Pray for Seminaries. Magiſtrates
and Chriſtian people: as Schooles of learning,
Colledges, Vniuerſities, Innes of Court, and other ſuch
like places where youth are trained vp and fitted to bee
vſefull members of the Church: yea alſo wee ought to
pray for Chriſtian Families, that in them children may
from their infancie be trained vp in pietie. In the Scripture
there is frequent mention made of children of the Prophets,
                  2. Kin. 2. 3, 5, 7. &amp; 4. 1. &amp; 6. 1.
which were trained vp vnder Prophets to ſucceed them in
their functions. And there were Colledges, and other like
places for training vp of theſe.2 King 22. 14.
               
               Concerning Seminaries,
                  1. Sam. 19. 18. 20. wee are to deſire two things eſpecially.
               1. A continuance of them.
               2. Gods bleſsing on them: that they may flouriſh in good
learning, and that their learning may be ſeaſoned with Grace:
for otherwiſe it may proue more dangerous then commodious
to the Church of God.
               This extent of our deſire for the good of Gods Church
after our time, ſheweth, that therein wee aime more at Gods
glory, and his Churches good, then at any priuate benefit to
our ſelues.
            
            
               
               §. 49. Of praying againſt euills which annoy
the Church.
               
                  Q. VVHat are the euills from which we ought to pray that
the Church may be protected?
               
                  A. The dominion of ſinne, of Satan, and of all
euill men which are Satans miniſters and inſtruments.
               Theſe haue kingdomes:Rom. 5. 21. for ſinne raigneth, and that vnto
death, where it findeth entertainment: and it maketh men ſeruants
vnto it ſelfe.Rom. 6. 17. Satan alſo is the god and Prince of this world.
and as a Prince he ruleth and worketh in the children of diſobedience,
                  2 Cor. 4. 4. Ioh. 14. 30.
All tyrants, perſecutors, and ſuch like enemies of the Church,Eph. 2. 2.
being in authoritie, are the deputies, and Vice-roys of ſinne and
Satan: vſing the vttermoſt of their power to bring men into
ſubiection vnder ſinne and Satan: the chiefeſt of theſe is Antichriſt.
The kingdome of all theſe is contrary to Chriſts kingdome:
and the ſtanding of them hindereth the comming of
Chriſts kingdome: and in that reſpect are we to pray that they
may be weakned and demoliſhed. Yea we are to pray that
euerything which cauſeth offence in the Church may be remoued:Math. 13. 41.
for which we haue an expreſſe promiſe.
               Theſe are the ſuits which we ought to put vp for the Church
indefinitely: and for ſuch parts thereof as we neuer knew, ſaw,
or heard of.
            
            
               §. 50. Of the things to be craued for particular Churches
which we know.
               
                  Q. HOw ought we to pray for particular Churches whoſe eſtate we
know?
               
                  A. We ought to frame our prayers according to that wee
heare, ſee, or otherwiſe know of any. As
               1. If any eſpeciall bleſſing be beſtowed on any,Col. 1. 9, 10. to pray that it
may be continued and increaſed.
               2. If any miſchieuous plots be practiſed againſt any,Eſt. 4. 16, 17. to pray
that they may be preuented.Acts: 2. 5.
               
               3. If miniſters or other members of any Churches be ſurpriſed,Heb. 13. 19.
                  
to pray that they may be deliuered.
               4. If perſecution be raiſed againſt any Church,Acts 4. 29. to pray that
either that fire may be quenched,1. Pet. 5. 10. or elſe that ſufficient courage
and ſtrength may be giuen to ſuch as are perſecuted to hold
out, and endure the vttermoſt tryall.
               5. If any noyſome weeds of Idolatrie,Gal. 5. 12. hereſie, ſchiſme, or
the like, ſprout vp in any Church, to pray that they may bee
rooted out. To ſharpen our prayer herein, we ought oft to call
to mind that which in this caſe is promiſed by Chriſt, Euery
plant which my heauenly Father hath not planted ſhall bee rooted
vp.
                  Math. 15. 13.
               
               This is that true vſe which we are to make of the knowledge
that we haue of the eſtate of any of Gods Churches.
            
            
               §. 51. Of praying for the Churches whereof in particular
we are members.
               
                  Q. HOw ought we to be affected towards thoſe particular Churches
whereof we are more immediate members?
               
                  A. 1. Our prayers ought to be more particularly applyed
to them.
               2 They ought to be more earneſtly extended for their good.
               To giue ſome inſtances of the particular application of our
prayers in this kind.
               1. We ought by name to pray for the Churches in the land
wherein we liue:Pray by name for our owne Churches. as the Iewes in ſpeciall manner prayed for
Sion and for Ieruſalem.Pſal. 74. 2. &amp; 137. 5, 6. Thus we of England ought in particular
and by name to pray for the Churches therein: yea becauſe
Scotland and Ireland are vnder the ſame gouernment that wee
are, by name to pray for thoſe Churches alſo.
               2. We ought by name to pray for the Magiſtrates that are ſet
ouer vs:And for our owne Magiſtrates and Miniſters. as for the Kings Maieſtie, ſo alſo for inferiour Magiſtrates.
And for the Miniſters of Gods word in the ſaid dominions.1. King. 1. 37, 47 Pſal. 72. 1.
               
               3. We ought more eſpecially to pray for the Citie,Pſal. 132. 9. Towne,And for the places of our abode.
or Pariſh where we liue. Ieremiah exhorted the Iewes when
they were in captiuitie to pray vnto the Lord of the Citie where
they abode.
                  Ier. 29. 7. Ought not wee much more to pray for the Citie or

Pariſh where we are in our owne Countrie, &amp; where we freely
enioy the holy ordinances of God? Here we ought by name to
remember the Miniſter that is ſet ouer vs;Epheſ. 6. 19. 
                  pray ſaith the Apoſtle,
and for me.
               
               4. Yet more frequently and earneſtly ought we to pray
for the family where we are,And for our familie. whether we be the head, or other
members thereof. Chriſt bid his diſciples into whatſoeuer
houſe they entred to pray that peace might be to it:
                  Luke 10. 5. much more
ought we to deſire the good of the familie where we haue our
continuall abode. We ought by vertue of this Petition to pray
that our familie in particular may be a ſeminarie and nurcerie
of the Church: yea that it may be a Church (as the houſes of
Philemon, Aquila, and Priſcilla were) which they are,Phile. 2. when
morning and euening ſacrifices of the calues of our lips are conſtantly
offered vp therein:Rom. 16. 5. and other duties of pietie meete to
be performed in a familie, are there conſcionably obſerued.
Such ought euery ones deſire to be for his owne familie, that
if pietie ſhould be baniſhed out of the Land or Pariſh where
he liues,Ioſ. 24. 15. yet it ſhould find harbour in his houſe: which was the
holy reſolution of Ioſhua.
               
               5. Finally,And for our owne perſons. becauſe euery ones perſon is moſt neare to himſelfe,
euery one ought moſt of all to pray for himſelfe, that his
perſon may be a fit temple for the holy Ghoſt:
                  2. Cor. 6. 16. and though the
houſe where we liue be an impure and impious place, no member
of any true Church, yet that he himſelfe may be as Ioſeph
was in the houſe of Potiphar,
                  Gen. 39. 2. a faithfull member of the true
Church, a free-hearted ſubiect of the kingdome of God: and
for this end euery one ought to pray that in his perſon he may
be ſanctified throughout, and his whole ſpirit, and ſoule, and bodie, be
kept blameleſſe vnto the comming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.
                  1. Theſ. 5. 23.
               
               This is that true and proper vſe which wee are to make of
thoſe bonds whereby we are outwardly linked one to another,
that as we are more nearely knit one to another, ſo more ſpecially
and inſtantly to pray that they to whom we are in outward
bonds linked, may with vs be faſt knit to the bodie of
Chriſt, and as true members thereof may beautifie and honour
it:Col. 2. 19. and that all the bodie by ioynts and bands hauing nouriſhment miniſtred,
and knit together may encreaſe with the encreaſe of God.
               
               
                  
Thus we ſee how our deſire ought to be ordered for the militant
Church. It ought in generall to be extended to the whole
bodie whereſoeuer: more particularly applied to the ſeuerall
parts of it, as we haue any notice thereof: and more earneſtly
extended for ſuch parts as wee our ſelues are more nearely
knit vnto.
            
            
               §. 52. Of the things to bee deſired for the
Church triumphant.
               
                  Q. VVHat are we to pray for in regard of the triumphant
Church, the kingdome of glorie?
               
                  A. The full perfection, and conſummation
thereof. Whereunto tend theſe particulars following.
               1. That we which liue in this kingdome of Grace,1. Pray to be fitted for heauen. may be
fitted and prepared for that kingdome of Glorie: that we may
be preſented as a chaſte and pure Virgine to our Huſband Chriſt.
                  2. Cor. 11. 2. Such
a prayer did the Apoſtle vſe to make for the members of the militant
Church.1. Theſ. 5. 23.
               
               2. That we may be looſed, and be with Chriſt in that glorious
place.2. Pray to be in heauen. For the gathering of ſuch into the kingdome of Glorie,Phil. 1. 23.
as belong thereunto helpeth forward the conſummation
of it.Hoc optamus vt finem noſtris faciat malis &amp; nos aſſumat in regnum. Aug. de Temp. Serm. 126 How we may pray for death. Votum affectus magis quam effectus.
               
               
                  Obiect. How can this deſire of being diſſolued ſtand with the
vnchangeable decree of God concerning the appointed time of
mans death?
               
                  Anſw. This kind of prayer rather ſheweth what we could
deſire, if the will of God were ſo, then what we would whether
it were Gods will or no. Neither is it made to alter Gods
determined purpoſe, but to manifeſt our longing deſire after
that which God in his eternall counſell hath purpoſed for vs.
Thus did many of the faithfull Iſraelites,
                  Math. 13. 17. that liued long before
the Meſſiah was exhibited,1. King. 19. 4. Ionah 43. 
                  deſire to ſee him. An abſolute deſire
of preſent death (as was the deſire of Eliah, and Ionah) is not
warrantable, but a longing after death to be in the kingdome
of Glorie (as was the deſire of Paul) is very commendable.Phil. 1. 23.
               
               3. That the number of thoſe whom God hath ordained to3. Pray for accompliſhing the number of the Elect.
                  
make full the body of Chriſt, may be accompliſhed. For there
is a certaine number ordained vnto eternall life,
                  Rom. 8. 29, 30. till that he be full,
the kingdome of Glorie cannot in all the parts thereof be conſummate.
               4. That the ſignes which in Gods word are fore-told to goe
before the comming of Chriſt may accordingly fall out:4. Pray for the ſignes of Chriſts comming. that
by the ſight of them we may be the more erected to looke for the
glorious appearing of Chriſt.
                  Math. 24, 29, &amp;c. There are ſignes fore-told; theſe
therefore muſt be prayed for.5 Pray againſt enemies of the Church.
               
               5. That all the obſtinate enemies of the Church which any
way hinder the full and perfect conſummation thereof may be
deſtroyed: and thoſe not only wicked men, and cruell tyrants,
and perſecutors, but alſo death, and him that hath the power
of death,1. Cor. 15. 15. the diuell. The deſtruction of theſe is promiſed: ſo as
there is good ground to pray for it.
               6. That the bodies of all the Saints which from the beginning
haue ſlept,
                  6. Pray for the reſurrection. may be raiſed from death, to be vnited to their
ſoules,1 Theſ. 4. 16. and brought vnto the kingdome of Glorie. For this is
abſolutely promiſed.
               
                  Obiect. This is to pray for the dead.
               
                  Anſw. Not for this or that particular friend departed whoſe
eſtate we certainly know not:How prayers to be made, or not to be made for the dead. but in generall for all the true
members of Chriſts celeſtiall bodie: nor to obtaine that for
them which was to be obtained in the times of their life, remiſſion
of ſinnes: nor yet to alter their finall eſtate, the doome
whereof paſſed vpon them at the moment of their diſſolution:
but onely as their reſurrection is a degree to the perfecting of
the kingdome of Glorie, we being taught to pray for the full
perfection of that kingdome, pray indefinitely for the reſurrection
of the Saints which is a degree thereto.
               7. That Chriſt would come in his glorie to iudgement:7. Pray for Chriſts coming. Reu. 22. 17. 20. Mat. 13. 41, 49. &amp; 25. 32. &amp;c. and
make a perfect ſeparation betwixt the elect and reprobate. For ſo
much is foretold and promiſed.
               8. That all the members of Chriſts myſticall bodie being
glorified with him,8. Pray for the full glorificatiō of the Church. 
                  He may deliuer vp the kingdome to God the Father,
that God may be all in all. For ſo much is alſo foretold.1. Cor. 15. 24, 28.
               
            
            
               
               §. 53. Of the things for which thankes is to be giuen
by reaſon of the ſecond Petition.
               
                  Q. FOr what are we to giue thankes by vertue of the ſecond Petition?
               
                  A. Euery thing that maketh to the good of Gods
Church, whether directly, by bleſſings beſtowed on it, or conſequently,
by reſtraining or ouer-throwing the enemies of it, miniſtreth
iuſt matter of thankſ-giuing. We are therefore to be
thankfull in the behalfe of the Church, in theſe caſes following,
and others like to them.
               1.Acts 11. 18. When Churches are planted where none were before. Thus
the Iewes glorified God, when they heard that the Goſpell was
embraced of the Gentiles.
               2. When ſuch Churches as are planted do thriue and proſper.
For this did S.2. Theſ. 1. 3. 
                  Paul giue thankes in the behalfe of the Theſſalonians.
               
               3. When good Magiſtrates are raiſed vp. In which caſe the
Queene of Sheba bleſſed God for ſetting Salomon on the throne
of Iſrael.1. King 10. 9. Much more are we to bleſſe God for good Miniſters
of his word: and that not onely when they are firſt raiſed vp, but
alſo when being reſtrained by ſickneſſe or any other meanes,2. Cor. 1. 3, 11.
they are againe reſtored.
               
               4.1. Theſ, 1. 2, 8. When the Goſpell hath a free paſſage, and ſoundeth forth
from one place to another.

               §. 54. Of the duties required vnder the
ſecond Petition.
               
                  Q. VVHat duties are we to endeauour after by vertue of the
ſecond Petition?
               
                  A. Euery one ought according to the eſtate
and condition wherein he is, to do what lyeth in his power to
helpe on the comming of the kingdome of God, and that both
in himſelfe, and in others alſo. For which end theſe particulars
following are carefully to be obſerued.
               1. They who are out of the Church muſt come into it. If
they be in the kingdome of darkneſſe, they muſt not abide
therein. This is eſpecially to be obſerued of them to whom the
light of the Goſpell appeareth, and diſcouereth their darkneſſe.
To ſuch it is ſaid,Eph. 5. 14. 
                  Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ariſe from the dead,
and Chriſt ſhall giue thee light.
               
               2. They who are in the Church muſt walke worthy of their
calling.
                  Epheſ. 4 1. To ſuch it is ſaid, Ye were once darkneſſe but are now light,
walke as children of light.
                  Eph. 5. 8.
               
               3. They who being of the Church are among ſuch as are out
of it, muſt labour to win them. Saint Paul went ſo farre he rein,
as he became as without law,
                  1. Cor. 9. 21. 
                  that he might gaine them that were

without law. To ſhew that this is a common dutie belonging
to euery member of the Church,1. Pet. 1. 1, 2. Saint Peter exhorteth women
ſo to carrie themſelues towards their husbands, as if any obey not
the word they may without the word be wonne by the conuer ſation of
their wiues.
               
               4.1. Theſ. 5. 11. Fellow members of the Church muſt edifie one another:
and hearten,Heb. 10. 24. encourage, and prouoke one another vnto good workes,
and to ſtand ſtedfaſt in the faith.
               5.Rom. 15. 1. &amp; 14 13. They who are ſtrong muſt beare with the weake: and
euery one take heed that they lay no ſtumbling blocke before
any to make them fall:1. Cor. 8. 9. nor giue any offence.
               6.Gen. 17. 12. If any be parents of children, they muſt be carefull to bring
them to be incorporated into the Church by the Sacrament of
Baptiſme, and that while they are infants: and as they come to
any yeares of diſcretion,Eph. 6. 4. to bring them vp in the nurture and admonition
of the Lord:
                  Pro. 22. 6. that thus, when they are tranſlated into the
triumphant Church, they may leaue their children behinde
them true members of the militant Church; and that ſucceſſiuely
generation after generation.
               7.Philem. v. 2. If any be houſholder, their care muſt bee to make their
houſes (as the houſes of Philemon,
                  Rom. 16. 5. 
                  Aquila, and Priſcilla were)
Churches of God. And in this reſpect take vpon them the faithfull
endeuour of Abraham,
                  Gen. 18. 19. and ſetled reſolution of Ioſua.
               
               8.Ioſ. 24. 15. They who are Miniſters muſt take heed to all the flockes
whereof the Holy Ghoſt hath made them ouer-ſeers to ſeed the Church
of God:
                  Act. 20. 28. and doe all things vnto edifying.
                  1. Cor. 14. 26.
               
               9. They who are Magiſtrates muſt maintaine true religion
in their dominions, and cauſe all that are vnder their iuriſdiction
to ſtand to the couenant of God.
                  2. Chro. 34. 33. Yea they ought to be ſo watchfull
ouer the Lords vineyard, as to ſuffer neither wilde boare to
roote it vp,Cant. 2. 15. nor foxes to make any hauocke therein. They muſt
ſuffer neither profeſt enemies, nor running ſeducers to harbour
therein.
            
            
               §. 55. Of the things to be bewailed vnder
the ſecond Petition.
               
                  Q. VVHat are the things that we ought to bewaile by vertue of
the ſecond Petition?
               
                  
                  A. All ſuch things as any way make to the diſaduantage
or diſparagement of the Kingdome of Chriſt. As
               1.2. Cor. 4. 4. 
                  That great ſway which Satan hath in the world, whereof
he is the god:
                  Epheſ. 2. 2. and worketh in the children of diſobedience: and
that all the world worſhippeth him.
                  Reu. 13. 3, 4. For all Infidels, Idolaters, Heretiques,
Schiſmatiques, hypocrites and profane perſons are
his vaſſals: and theſe are they with whom the world is filled.
               2.Mic. 7. 1. 
                  The ſmall circuit of Chriſts Kingdome. The Prophet thus
bringeth in the Church her ſelfe bewailing her ſmall number,
Woe is mee: for I am as when they haue gathered the ſummer
fruits: as the grape gleanings of the vintage.
               
               3.Math. 13 25, &amp;c. 
                  The mixture of Satans ſubiects with Chriſts in that ſmall
circuit. For where the Lord of the field ſoweth good ſeed, the
enuious man ſoweth Tares: which maketh the ſeruants of the
Lord to complaine.
               4. The many clouds which obſcure the light of the Goſpell. I
meane the clouds of errour, ſuperſtition, humane traditions and
ſuch like, whereby the cleare light of the Goſpell is hindred
from ſhining forth in his full brightneſſe. Chriſt himſelfe complaineth,
that the Word of God is made of none effect through
the many traditions of the Iewes.Mar. 7. 13.
               
               5.Pſal. 50. 13. 
                  The ſpoiles of the Church made by open enemies: whereof
Dauid much complaineth: ſo doe alſo other Prophets.
               6.Cant. 1. 2. Treacheries of falſe-hearted brethren. The Church complaineth
that all her friends dealt treacherouſly with her: and
Chriſt complaineth that his owne familiar friend in whom hee
truſted,Pſal. 41. 9. 
                  which did eate of his bread, lift vp his heele againſt him.
               
               7. Vnſaithfulneſſe in Magiſtrates: ſuffering ſuch as beare
no good will to the Church to creepe into it, lodge in it, and
worke miſchiefe againſt it.Neh. 13. 4, &amp;c. This did good Nehemiah much
complaine of. Much more cauſe of complaint there is, when
Princes in the Church are roaring Lyons,
                  Zeph. 3 3. 
                  and her Iudges are
euening Wolues.
               
               8. Vnfaithfulneſſe in Miniſters: when they are inſufficient,
idle, corrupt in doctrine or life: whereby the edification of
the Church is much hindered.Iſa. 56. 10. The Prophets oft complaine of
ſuch.ler. 23. 14, 17.
               
               9. Deſolation of Seminaries: as of Schooles, Colledges, Vniuerſities,

and ſuch like.1. Sam. 22. 22. 
                  Dauid lamented the deſtruction of the
Citie of Prieſts which was a Seminarie. The comming of the
Kingdome of God is much hindred by the deſolation of Seminaries.
So alſo is it as much, if not more, hindred by corruption
in Seminaries. If fountaines bee poiſoned, can wholeſome
ſtreames bee expected to flow from thence? In corrupted Seminaries
more vaſſals of Satan, then true ſubiects of Chriſt are
bred and brought vp.
               10. Diſorder of Families. When pietie findeth in priuate
Families little or no entertainment, if it bee not cleane thruſt
out of doores: and ſuch licentiouſneſſe vſed, as houſes are
rather made ſties for Satan, then Churches of God, great cauſe
of mourning is giuen.Ier. 7. 18. 
                  Ieremiah complaines that husbands and
wiues, parents and children, were all giuen to wickedneſſe.
               11. Profeſſors vnworthy walking. It is meanes to keepe ſuch
as are not of the Church from entring into it, when they ſee
ſuch as profeſſe themſelues to bee of the Church, to walke as
children of darkneſſe, and to turne the grace of God into
wantonneſſe.Phil. 3. 18. Saint Paul doth bitterly complaine of ſuch.
               12. Reproaches caſt vpon the Saints. Sarah when ſhe beheld
Iſmael ſcoffing at Iſaak,
                  Gen. 21. 9. 10. was exceedingly moued thereat. So
was Dauid at Michols ſcorning of him for the manifeſtation of
his zeale.2. Sam. 6. 20. Some weake members of the Church may be diſcouraged
thereby; and in that reſpect it is a matter to bee lamented.
               13.1. King. 19. 10. 
                  Perſecution raiſed againſt the Church. This did Eliah
much bewaile: yea it made him weary of his life. A free paſſage
of the Word, and a free vſe of other holy ordinances of
God is much hindered thereby: and many are thereby brought
to deny the faith: and therefore it is to be bewailed.
               14.2. Tim. 4 16. 
                  Timorous backeſliding of Profeſſors. This did S. Paul
complaine of in his time. Much doth this tend to the diſcouragement,
and diſaduantage of the Church: and much to be lamented.
               15.1. Cor. 1. 11. &amp; 11, 18. 
                  Sciſmes, ſects, and diſſentions in the Church. Theſe doe
much hinder the growth of the Church: yea they oft cauſe
greater deſolation then open oppoſitions of profeſſed enemies.

If men might liue as long they would, how ſlowly would

               §. 56. Of the will of God here meant, and doing it.
               
                  Q. VVHich is the third Petition?
               A. Thy will bee done in earth as it is in
heauen.
               Q. What is here to be conſidered.
               
                  A. 1. The Thing deſired.
               2. The Manner of performing it.
               The ſubſtance then of the Petition is in theſe words, Thy will
be done in earth. In the words following is a direction for the
better performing of that which is deſired. Of theſe two
points therefore we are to ſpeake in order. And firſt of the Petition,
that ſetteth out the rule which in all things we ought to
ſet before vs: namely, the will of God.
               
               Q. How doth God will a thing?
               
                  A. 1.Epheſ. 1. 11. By ordaining and deternining it.
               2.Rom. 12. 2. By liking and approuing it.
               By this differing manner of willing things,Gods ſecret and reuealed will. may Gods will
be diſtinguiſhed into his Secret Counſell, and Reuealed Word.
               
               The former of theſe is that Soueraigne, abſolute will of
God, by which all things are, and without which nothing can
be. ForEpheſ. 1. 11. 
                  He worketh all things after the counſell of his owne will:
                  Pſal. 115. 3. 
                  And hath done whatſoeuer he pleaſed.
                  Rom. 11. 34. 
                  For who was his Counſeller?
               
               The latter is ſtiled Gods good and acceptable will:
                  Rom. 12. 2. whereby
he manifeſteth what is pleaſing vnto him.Gods reuealed will here meant
               
               
                  Q. Which of theſe is here eſpecially meant?
               
                  A. His reuealed Word: as is euident by theſe reaſons.
               1. The reuealed things of God belong to vs and our children for
euer, Deut. 29. 29.
               2. Gods reuealed Word is that rule which wee muſt lay

before vs,Non vbiquè ſicut poteſtas, ſic voluntas eius bona, &amp; beneplacita, &amp; perſecta. Ber. de verb. Eſa. Serm. 5. and the marke whereat wee ought to haue an eye in
all things. Pſal. 119. 9.
               3. This will of God may be reſiſted, and is much reſiſted,
by the ſonnes of men. For ſaith Chriſt, How oft would I, &amp;c.
And ye would not? Math. 23. 37. Gods good and acceptable
and perfect will is not euery where as his power is.
               There is therefore great need that wee ſhould pray to haue
this done.Non vt Deus faciat quae vult ſed vt nos facere poſsimus quae deus vult. Cypr. de Orat. dom. §. 11. Not that God would doe what he will, but that we
may be able to doe what he will. As for Gods ſecret co
                     •
                  nſell
(as it is kept ſecret) it cannot be here meant, as appeareth by
theſe reaſons.
               1.Deut. 29, 29. Secret things belong vnto the Lord our God.
               2.Pro. 19. 21. 
                  The counſell of God ſhall ſtand: it cannot but be done: ſo
as we need not pray that it may be done.
               3. A deſire may bee made contrarie to Gods ſecret will
without ſinne. Inſtance the deſire of Dauid to build a temple
for the Lord: which deſire both Nathan the Prophet of the
Lord,2. Sam. 7. 3. and God alſo himſelfe approued, and yet it was the determined
purpoſe of God that Dauid ſhould not doe that
which he deſired.1. King. 8. 18.
               
               Yet if the foreſaid counſell of God bee made knowne either
extraordinarily by ſpeciall reuelation,How Gods counſell is to be yeelded vnto. or ordinarily by euents
(for euents doe declare the determined counſell of God)
then ought there to bee yeelded thereto a willing ſubmiſſion:
which ſubmiſſion is commended in the examples ofIob 1. 21. 
                  Iob,
                  1. Sam. 3. 18. 
                  Eli,
                  2. Sam, 12, 22, 23.

                  Act. 21. 13. 
                  Paul and other Saints. And thus doth this
phraſe (be done) import both obedience to Gods Word, and
alſo ſubiection to his worke: or a willing yeelding to whatſoeuer
God ſaith or doth. It is a phraſe both of action and paſſion.
Of action in relation to Gods Word.How Gods will is done. Of paſsion in relation to
his guiding prouidence: and importeth patience and contentment
euen in ſuch things as croſſe our owne minds: in which
ſence ſaid Pauls companions, when they heard his reſolution
to goe to Ieruſalem where the Prophet had foretold that hee
ſhould be bound,
                     Act. 21. 14. 
                  The will of the Lord be done. In regard of Gods
ſecret wil,Cum diuinus fiat voluntas tuae, nobis ab illo prccamur ipſum obedientiam. Aug. epiſt. 121. we pray that nothing which God doth, diſpleaſe vs:
and in regard of his reuealed will, that nothing which wee do,
diſpleaſe him. Obedience therefore to God is here principally
prayed for.

expreſſed in the firſt perſon (thus, Let vs doe) our deſire might
ſeeme to be appropriated to our ſelues. If in the third perſon
(thus; Let men doe) it might ſeeme to be poſted ouer to others
from our ſelues:Chryſt. in Mat. 6. Hom. 20. but this indefinite phraſe, be done, may indifferently
be referred to our ſelues and all others whatſoeuer
they be.
            
            
               §. 58. Of the rule of our obedience, Gods will.
               Q. VVHat learne wee from the expreſſe mention of Gods
will in this Petition?
               
                  A. Gods will is the rule of our obedience: ſo as, if ſuch a queſtion
as the People,
                  Luk. 3. 10. 12, 14 
                  Publicans, and Souldiers propounded to
Iohn,
                  Luke 18. 18. or the Ruler to Chriſt: or the Iewes to the Apoſtles,
be moued,Acts 2. 37. and it be demanded what is to be done, in a word out
of this Petition,Epheſ. 5. 17. this anſwere may be giuen, Gods will. This is
it which oft▪ we are enioyned to vnderſtand,
                  Rom. 12. 2. to proue, to practiſe:
and which is ſo much preſſed in the 119.Epheſ. 6. 6. Pſalme. And
that not without iuſt cauſe.Gods will the ground of goodneſſe. For Gods will is the very ground
of goodneſſe. Whatſoeuer is willed of God is good: and
therefore good, becauſe it is willed of God. Where the Apoſtle
prayeth for the Hebrewes, that God would make them
perfect in euery good worke;
                  Heb. 13. 21. by way of expoſition he addeth this
clauſe, To doe his will.
               
               They who make Decrees of Councels,No ſufficient rule but Gods will. Traditions of Elders,
Statutes or Canons of men, or any other thing beſides
Gods Word their rule, haue but a Leaden rule, which may be
bowed this way or that way. What may we then think a mans
owne reaſon, will, luſt, appetite or humour to be? and yet doe
many make theſe the rules of their obedience.
               For our parts let vs thorowly acquaint our ſelues with Gods
Word,Be acquainted with the Word. Pſal. 1, 2. and therein exerciſe our ſelues day and night. Let vs

make it our Counſeller, to be reſolued thereby in all doubts:
our guide to be directed thereby in all our wayes: our Light,
to be enlightened thereby thorow the darkneſſe of this world:
our Touchſtone to proue and try all things thereby. And let
vs haue it in as high account as euer Dauid had it.Pſal. 119. ver. 72, 103.
               
            
            
               §. 59. Of practiſing Gods will.
               
                  Q. VVHat doth this phraſe (be done) teach vs?
               
                  A. Nothing is ſufficient without practiſe. I ſay
nothing, becauſe neither knowledge of Gods will, nor a good
diſpoſition thereto, nor profeſsion thereof, without doing it, is
any thing. All theſe are in their kinde needfull: for practiſe
without knowledge can not but be very prepoſterous: without
a good diſpoſition, meerely hypocriticall; and without
a free profeſſion, too too timerous; ſo as knowledge of Gods
will is as light to giue direction vnto practiſe: a good diſpoſition
thereto is as ſalt, to ſeaſon it: a free profeſſion is as
wine to make it quicke and cheerefull. But yet all thoſe without
practiſe are as nothing. He that knoweth his Maſters will
and doth not according to it ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.
                  Luke 12. 47. Hee
that hath a good minde and diſpoſition to Gods will, and yet
doth it not, condemneth himſelfe in that which hee alloweth: and
he that maketh a faire profeſſion of it, but yet doth it not, is
like to that Figgetree which Chriſt curſed:Math. 21. 19. and hee hath
this doome denounced againſt him by the Iudge of all, Depart
from mee thou worker of iniquitie. I may therefore well
ſay to them that know, like, and profeſſe Gods will, Bleſſed
are ye if ye doe it.
                  The benefit of practiſe, 1. Ioh. 2. 4. But without doing, all is in vaine. For
               1. There is no truth of Grace, where there is no practiſe
of Grace.
               2.Deut. 6. 1. Doing of Gods will is the maine end of reuealing Gods
will.
               3. The benefit of all conſiſteth in practiſe: For by it, is
Ioh. 15. 8. God moſt glorified: our1. Theſ. 1. 7. fellow-Saints ſtirred vp to an holy
emulation:1. Pet. 3. 1. they which are without or wonne, or—16. made aſhamed:
and we our ſelues2. Pet. 1. 10. aſſured of our Election before the
world, and ſaluation after the world: gaining alſo thereby1. Tim. 5. 10. a

good name while we liue, andProu. 10. 7. a bleſſed memoriall after we
are dead.
               If theſe motiues be not ſufficient to moue ſuch as know the
will of God to adde practiſe thereunto, and to doe it, I know
not what can be ſufficient.

mee (ſaith the Lord) yee can doe nothing.
                  Phil. 2. 13. 
                  It is God that worketh
in vs both to will and to doe. As for man, take him as hee
is of himſelfe, and it will appeare thatGen. 6. 5. 
                  euery imagination of
the thought of his heart is onely euill continually. And by the
weakeneſſe of this corruptible body wee are held backe from
bringing our wils to yeeld vnto, and agree with Gods will.
Is it then poſſible that of himſelfe hee ſhould doe that which
is ſo pure and perfect as the will of God is?Ipſa corruptibilis huius infirmitate corporis praepedimur ne voluntas noſtra diuinae valeat coberere. Bern. in Quadr. Serm. 6.
               
               On this ground we ſee that there is iuſt cauſe
               1. To deny our ſelues, andProu. 3. 5. 
                  not to leane vnto our owne wiſedome,

that it did in the other two, namely, a Reaſon, Reſtraint,
and Emphaſis.
               
               A Reaſon, becauſe it ſheweth that the Will here mentioned
is the will of Our Father who is in heauen, whoſe name is aboue
all to be hallowed, and whoſe kingdome is before all to be
preferred.
               
               A Reſtraint, becauſe it implyeth that his will onely is to be
done.
               An Emphaſis, becauſe it intimateth an aduancing of Gods
will aboue all others.
            
            
               §. 62. Of preferring Gods will before all others.

owne wils,Si filius obaudiuit vt faceret patris voluntatem, quanto magis ſervus obaudire debet, vt ſaciat domini voluntatem. Cypr. loc. citat. to Gods, in ſuch things as if it had beene the will
of God, they could haue deſired to haue beene otherwiſe. Among
others, the example of Chriſt is to be obſerued, becauſe
hee was a Sonne, and we are but ſeruants. If the Sonne yeelded
to doe the will of his Father, how much more ought the ſeruant
to yeeld to doe the will of his Maſter.
               
               Both the ſupreme Soueraignty of God, and alſo the abſolute
perfection of his will require as much.Docemur ſemper ad Dei, non ad noſtram reſpicere voluntatem, quia in noſtra voluntate aliquotiens contaria ſuut: in domini autem voluntate vita eſt ſemper &amp; bonitas. Aug. de Temp. Serm. 126 As for our owne and other
mens wil they are ſubiect to much errour, and oft proue
very pernicious.
               This is eſpecially to be noted of ſuch as can bee content to
doe Gods will ſo farre as it is agreeable to their own humour,
or croſſeth not the will of thoſe men whom they are loth to
offend. But if in theſe caſes they refuſe to doe Gods will, they
haue it not in that high account that here they are taught to
haue it, and they come very ſhort of the extent of this Petition,
whereby wee are taught alwayes to haue one eye on Gods

will, and not on our owne. For in our will there are many contrarieties,
but in the Lords will there is alwaies life and
goodneſſe.
            
            
               §. 63. Of praying onely for men in earth.
               
                  Q. VVHo are compriſed vnder this phraſe in earth?
               
                  A. Sonnes of men inhabiting in earth.Iob 4. 19. In
this phraſe there is a double trope.Metony
                        •
                     ia ſubiecti. Synec doc he generis. Firſt the Place
is put for them that are therein. Secondly, a generall is put for a
particular. For there are ſundry ſorts of creatures that liue on
earth: yet onely the chiefe and principall of them are meant:
euen they who haue the dominion ouer all the reſt. Now Men
are here thus ſet forth, becauſe while they liue on earth they are
moſt backward to do Gods will.
               
                  Q. What inſtruction may be raiſed from this phraſe in earth?
               
               
                  A. Men while they liue in this world need our prayers. All the
directions giuen in Scripture to pray for any, all the promiſes
made to prayer, all the warrant that is giuen for performing
this dutie, is reſtrained to prayer made for them that liue in
earth. And they are to be prayed for:
               1. Becauſe they are ſubiect to manifold infirmities.
               2. Becauſe they may reape benefit by our prayers: which
they that are taken from earth can not doe. For they that are
tranſlated from earth to heauen are made perfect: ſo as they
need not our prayers. And they that are caſt downe from earth
to hell, are implonged into ſuch irrecouerable miſerie, as they
can reape no benefit by our prayers.
               Let vs not therefore offer vp ſo pretious incenſe as prayer is,
in vaine, for ſuch as can reape no benefit thereby. But in faith let
vs pray for them that are in earth.
            
            
               §. 64. Of the meaning of this phraſe
in heauen.The inhabitants of the higheſt heauens, not the hoſts of the middle heauen are here meant.
               
               
                  Q. VVHo are compriſed vnder this phraſe in heauen?
               
               
                  A. The glorious Angels and glorified Saints
with Chriſt their head.
               
                  
Some thinke the middle heauen to be here meant, where the
Sunne, Moone, and other Stars are placed: and that partly becauſe
the creatures in that heauen do conſtantly keepe that
courſe wherein by the will of their Creator they were at firſt
placed; and partly becauſe they are viſible, ſo as that conſtant
courſe of theirs according to the will of God, may be ſeene by
men on earth. But howſoeuer that conſtancie of theirs may be
a witneſſe againſt our manifold aberrations, and ſweruings
from that courſe wherein our Creator hath ſet vs: yet in that
they haue no vnderſtanding to take notice of the will of God,
nor do what they do by any free,Hoc oramus vt dei volunt
                        •
                     s ſicut in coeleſtibus facta eſt creaturis, ſiat etiam in terrenis: vt ſicut Angelus ſic &amp;. homo, &amp;c. Bern. in Quadr. Serm. 6. willing choice, but by a naturall
motion from which they can not ſwerue, we muſt aſcend
higher then that heauen, euen to the higheſt heauen of all,
where the forenamed Angels and Saints are, who in all things
by a moſt free and willing choice do perfectly fulfill the will of
God.
               Q. How can they whom we ſee not to be a patterne for vs?
               
                  A. By the word we may know what is done by them. For
God hath thereby manifeſted how they do his will.
            
            
               §. 65. Of the manner of following a
perfect patterne.
               
                  Q. HOw can we do Gods will as they do it, ſeeing they in all points
do it moſt perfectly: and it is impoſſible for vs to attaine to
ſuch a perfection?
               
                  A. 1. In ſuch a manner as they do, may we alſo do Gods
will, though not in ſo compleate a meaſure. A candle giueth
light in an houſe, euen as the Sunne doth in the world: in ſuch
a manner, not in ſo great meaſure. There may be in qualitie
and likeneſſe a compariſon betwixt things that are in quantitie
and meaſure very vnequall. In this reſpect they who haue hope
in Chriſt are ſaid to purifie themſelues euen as he is pure.
               
               2. All the Saints euen on earth haue the beginning of that
heauenly perfection wrought in them:1. Ioh. 3. 3. which beginning the Apoſtle
ſtileth The firſt fruites of the Spirit.
                  Rom. 8. 23. Now we may be confident
of this very thing,
                  Phil. 1. 6. 
                  that he who hath begun a good worke in vs, will

performe it vntill the day of Ieſus Chriſt:
                  1. Cor. 1. 8. 
                  that we may be blameleſſe in
that day.
               
               3. Our deſire and endeauour may and muſt be beyond our
abilitie:Phil. 3. 13. as ſhall be proued by and by.
            
            
               §. 66. Of the matter of Patience which the inhabitants
of heauen haue.
               
                  Q. HOw can there be a ſufficient patterne where there is no triall
of Patience, as in heauen there is none? For the Angels
and Saints in heauen are not ſubiect to any croſſes that ſhould trie their
patience.
               
                  A. This patterne is eſpecially for actiue obedience.
               2. Thoſe heauenly Spirits do many things which they would
not but for the will of God. When it is the will of God, the Angels
do willingly deſcend from heauen to earth,
                  Gen. 28. 12. ſometimes to bring
glad tidings to the Church,Reu. 14. 6, 19. and ſometimes to execute vengeance
on ſinners. Yea the ſoules of the Saints which haue bene taken
out of their bodies &amp; carried into Abrahams boſome, that place
of ioy and bliſſe, haue bene contented at the will of God to
leaue their glorie,Mat. 27. 53. and to returne againe into their bodies,
euen asIoh. 6. 38. Ioh. 11. 44. 
                  Chriſt came downe from heauen, not to do his owne will, but
the will of him that ſent him: and as his ſouleLuke 23. 43. after it had bene in
Paradiſe—24 5, 6. returned into his body in earth. Now heauen, Paradiſe,
and Abrahams boſome is a place of ſuch glorie, and ſo
conſpicuouſly doth the brightneſſe of Gods glorie there ſhine
forth, as the coeleſtiall ſpirits would neuer be willing to depart
out of it, but to do the will of their Lord.
               3. There is a compaſſion in them for the afflictions of the
Church in earth. For the Saints in earth and in heauen are fellow
members of one and the ſame bodie: in which reſpect there
cannot but be ſome ſympathie and fellow-feeling of their fellow-members
afflictions: euen asMat 25. 42. &amp;c. there is in the head of that
bodie Ieſus Chriſt. The maine reaſon why theReu. 6. 10. ſoules of the
Martyrs, departed, deſire vengeance on the enemies of the
Church, is for thoſe Saints ſake who were liuing, and ſo ſubiect
to their tyrannie and crueltie. It is ſaid that there is ioy in
the preſence of the Angels of God,
                  Luke 15. 10. 
                  ouer one ſinner that repenteth.

Why not then compaſſion alſo ouer the Church that is afflicted?
               4. The Saints in heauen through patience inherit the promiſes.Heb 6. 12.
(For through many afflictions men enter into the kingdome of God)
and therein we are exhorted to be followers of them.

and perfect conſummation of that glorie which is ordained
for the whole bodie of Chriſt, and all the members thereof.
When it was tould the ſoules of the forenamed Martyrs deceaſed,
that they ſhould reſt vntill their brethren ſhould be fulfilled,
they were ſilent, and patient: they replied not againe.
               Thus then wee ſee that in heauen there is a patterne of
patience.Reu. 6. 11.
               
            
            
               §. 67. Of well doing good.
               
                  Q. VVHat learne we from this direction (as it is in heauen)
added to the Petition?
               
                  A. Good things are to be done after a right manner.
So much is noted in the ſumme of the Morall Law, as

                     Mat. 22. 37, 39 In ſacrificijs quae Abel &amp; Cain primiobtulerunt, non munera eorum deus, ſed corda intue batur vt ille placeret in munere qui placebat in corde. Cypr. de Orat. Dom. §. 18. 
                  Chriſt hath ſet it downe. The good things enioyned are to loue
God, and our neighbour. The manner of louing God, is to do it
with all the heart, &amp;c. The manner of louing our neighbour is to
loue him, as our ſelfe. If the Scriptures be obſeruantly read, we
ſhall find them as copious in preſcribing the right manner, as in
preſſing the maine matter of any du
                     •
                  ie: and in declaring Gods
approbation of the one more then of the other. Take for example
the firſt worke of pietie recorded to be done after mans fall.
In the ſacrifices which Abel and Caine firſt offered, God did
not behold the offering, but the heart, that he might pleaſe God
in his offering, that pleaſeth him in his heart. The offering declared
the worke: the heart the manner of doing it.

                  Gods will is manifeſted in the manner as well as in the
matter. Yea if a good thing be euilly done, God will ſay,Iſa. 1. 12. 
                  who
required this at your hands? For a good thing isIſa. 66. 3. cleane peruerted,
and made euill by an euill manner of doing it.
               It is therefore very requiſite that we1. Cor. 11. 28. 
                  examine good things
euen by the manner of doing them: and not thinke it ſufficient

that the thing we do is for the matter and ſubſtance of it lawfull
and warrantable. As many (if not many more) tranſgreſſions
are committed by failing in the manner of doing good things,
as by doing things which are ſimply euill.
            
            
               §. 68. Of propounding a perfect patterne
before vs.
               
                  Q. VVHat are we taught by the kind of patterne ſet before
vs?
               
                  A. The patterne which we follow muſt be perfect:
ſuch a patterne is the example of thoſe that are in heauen.Heb. 12. 23. 
                  They
are ſpirits of iuſt men made perfect. Like patternes cannot be found
on earth, except the patterne of Chriſt in the dayes of his fleſh,
Phil. 2. 5. Heb. 12. 2. which is alſo ſet before vs.
               
                  Q. How are examples of Saints on earth to be followed, if our patterne
muſt be perfect?
               
                  A. No Saints example that euer liued on earth for the time
of his abode on earth,How Saints on earth are to be followed. is made a patterne in all things without
exception to be followed. But their examples are ſet before vs
to be imitated.
               1. In ſuch particular good things as they did well. Thus
Gal. 3. 7. 
                  Abraham in beleeuing Gods promiſes;Nom. 12. 7. 
                  Moſes in being faithfull
in Gods houſe; thelam. 5. 10, 11. 
                  Prophets in long ſuffering; Iob in patience;
other Saints in other particular graces are made patternes.
               2.1. Cor. 11. 1. So farre forth as they followed a perfect patterne we muſt
follow them.
               We are very proane to follow imperfections:The danger of ſetting imperfect patternes before vs. as a ſtreame
where a breach is made, will leaue the channell to runne in that
breach: and by ſtriuing to runne therein will make the breach
greater and greater: ſo we, where we ſee any defect in the patterne,
are readie not onely to faile by that defect, but to be farre
worſe.Math. 23. 15. 
                  A Proſelite made by a Phariſie, proued two-fold more
a child of hell then the Phariſie. We are, by that corruption of
nature which is in vs, proane to ſwerue from the patterne which
is ſet before vs, euen where the patterne it ſelfe is good and
right. How much more ſhall we ſwerue when the patterne is

defectiue? YetPhil 3. 15. 
                  by a perfect patterne we ſhall be kept the nearer,
and held the cloſer to perfection.
               
               It is therefore a point that much concerneth vs to make
choice of our patterne:Choice to be made of our patterne. and not to be beguiled with glorious
titles of Antiquitie, Vniuerſalitie, Multitude, and Conſent of
men on earth. Perfection was neuer found in theſe: much leſſe
in ſome few, or ſingle men that are blinded and puffed vp with
honour, wealth, power, or any ſuch earthly preheminence. Yet
how doth the whole world almoſt follow ſuch, and make them
their onely patterne?
            
            
               §. 69. Of aiming at more then we
can attaine to.
               
                  Q. VVHat learne we from ſetting thoſe who are in heauen as
a patterne before thoſe who are in earth?
               
                  A. Such perfection as in this life cannot be attained
to, may be aimed at. For it is not poſſible for any on earth
to bee ſo perfect as they who are in heauen: yet muſt we aime at
their perfection, and endeauour after it. For Chriſt exhorteth
to be perfect as our heauenly Father is perfect.
                  Mat. 5. 48.
               
               1. Thus ſhall we the better diſcerne how far ſhort we come
of perfection, and of that integritie which is requiſite for all
thoſe that ſtand in Gods glorious preſence. On this ground
ſaith Iob,
                  Iob 9. 2. 
                  How ſhould man compared vnto God be iuſtified?
               
               2. Thus we ſhall be the more humbled, and brought to ſay
to God as Iob did:
                  Iob 40 4.—40. 6. Behold I am vile, what ſhall I anſwer thee? I will
lay my hands vpon my mouth. I abhorre my ſelfe, and repent in duſt
and aſhes.
               3. Thus ſhall we be brought to a thorow and vtter deniail
of our ſelues: and from all ſelf-conceipt and confidence in our
owne righteouſneſſe:Pſal. 143. 2. and to pray vnto God not to enter into
iudgement with vs.
               
               4. Thus ſhall we be the more ſtirred vp to put forth our vttermoſt
abilitie:Phil 3. 13, 14. as it is in the Prouerbe, He that will ſhoote high
muſt aime at the Sunne, a marke farre beyond his reach. A man
that ſhooteth at a marke within his reach may ſhoote ſhort for
want of putting out his full ſtrength.
               
                  
Little do they regard theſe helpes,Their folly who make ſinfull men their patterne. who ſet the examples of
mortall, weake, ſinfull men before them: and thinke all is well
if they be any thing better then the worſer ſort of people; as
that Phariſie who ſaid.Luke 18. 11. 
                  O God, I thanke thee that I am not as other
men are, extortioners, vniuſt, adulterers, or euen as this Publican.
Hence is it that they are ſo farre from iudging themſelues for
many of their ſinnes, as they are readie rather to iuſtifie themſelues
when they are reproued, and to ſay, Do not ſuch and ſuch
men the like? What ſinne almoſt might not be iuſtified if the patterne
of men on earth, yea of the beſt, were a ſufficient plea and
pretext? Haue ye not heard of Noahs drunkenneſſe, Dauids
adulterie and murther, Lots inceſt Salomons idolatrie, Peters deniall
of Chriſt, and other like ſinnes committed by other like
men? By ſuch patternes men are many times made to ſtumble
in the way wherein they ſhould walke, if they be not cleane
turned out of it.
               The patterne here propounded by our Lord ſtirreth vs vp
to couet earneſtly,
                  Seeke to excell. 1. Cor. 12. 31.—14. 12. 
                  the beſt gifts, and to ſeeke to excell.
               
               By this patterne in heauen ſet before vs,Reproofe of prophane ſcoffs. the common ſcoffes
of prophane Libertines (vpbraiding ſuch as endeauour to follow
this direction, with the nick-names of Angels on earth, and
young Saints) are wiped away. How can thoſe tauntes be imagined
to be otherwiſe made then in deriſion of this direction?
which aſſuredly he that gaue this direction will not ſuffer to
paſſe vnreuenged.
            
            
               §. 70. Of the order of the third Petition.
               
                  Q. TO which of the former Petitions hath this third Petition reference?
               
                  A. To both of them.
               To the firſt as a manifeſtation of the truth of our deſire to
hallow Gods Name. For no ſuch euidence can be giuen thereof,
as a true and thorow ſubiection of our ſelues in all things to the
will of God. Then is Gods Name moſt hallowed, when his will
is beſt done. Of all places, in heauen is Gods Name moſt hallowed,
becauſe there his will is beſt done: for which end Chriſt
doth here ſet them in heauen before vs for a patterne therein.
               
                  
To the ſecond Petition hath this reference as a reaſon of our
deſire thereof. For the ſubiects of Gods kingdome are they
that moſt readily and faithfully do the will of God. We therefore
deſire that Gods kingdome may come, that there may be
the more to do the will of God.
            
            
               §. 71. Of the honour done to God by doing
his will.
               
                  Q. VVHat doctrine ariſeth out of that relation which this Petition
hath to the firſt?
               A. Gods honour is moſt aduanced by a faithfull ſubiection to his
will.Ioh. 17. 4. 
                  Thus doth Chriſt proue that he glorified his Father on earth,
namely, by finiſhing the worke which he gaue him to do.
               For by our forwardneſſe to do Gods will we acknowledge
both the greatneſſe and alſo the goodneſſe of God. We acknowledge
that he is the ſupreme Soueraigne who hath power
to require this and that to be done: and withall we acknowledge
that what he declareth to be his will is moſt good. For
theſe are the motiues which are of force to draw vs on to do
any ones will: the Soueraigntie that he hath ouer vs that willeth
this or that: and the equitie of that which hee willeth.
               We ought therefore hereby to be the more ſtirred vp to do
Gods will: becauſe thereby his Name is hallowed.
            
            
               §. 72. Of ſhewing our ſelues to be Gods ſubiects
by doing his will.
               
                  Q. VVHat doctrine ariſeth out of the relation which this Petition
hath to the ſecond?
               
                  A. They are the trueſt ſubiects of Gods kingdome, who are readieſt
to do his will.
               Hence was it that the Pſalmiſt where he ſhewed that God
had ſet vp his Sonne a King, inferreth theſe exhortations,
Serue the Lord,
                  Pſal. 2. 6, 11, 12. 
                  Kiſſe the Sonne, &amp;c. And againe vpon a like
ground he ſaith,Pſal. 110. 3. 
                  Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy
power.
               
               
                  
The Word of God (which is that will of God that is here
eſpecially meant) is the Scepter of his Kingdome, and the law
thereof. All the Statutes and Ordinances of his Kingdome are
compriſed in his Word; they therefore that doe it muſt needs
be his beſt ſubiects.
               This then is a true tryall of our ſpirituall eſtate:Mat. 12. 49, 50. whether we
be indeed of his Kingdome or no.Pſal. 40. 8. If wee delight to doe his will,
and his law be in our hearts, then haue we good aſſurance in our
owne ſoules, and giue good euidence to others that wee are
true members of his Church, true ſubiects of his Kingdome.
But if there be nothing but a bare profeſſion, wee are like to
the Figge-tree that cumbred the ground:
                  Luke 13. 7. or like to thoſe who
ſaid they were Gods people, but indeed were the Synagogue of
Satan.
                  Reu. 2. 9. Gods Kingdome commeth not by profeſſing and ſaying,
but by performing and doing Gods will.Math. 7. 21.
               
            
            
               §. 73. Of the particulars which we are taught to pray
for in the third Petition.
               
                  Q. VVHat are the particulars for which by vertue of the third
Petition we ought to pray?
               
                  A. 1. Such as concerne the Petition it ſelfe.
               2. Such as concerne the Direction added thereto.
               
                  Q. To how many heads may the things which concerne the Petition
it ſelfe be referred?
               
                  A. To foure eſpecially. Which are theſe,
               1. The Rule it ſelfe, in this word WILL.
               2. The Reſtraint of it, in this Particle THY.
               3. The Extent of it, in this phraſe BE DONE.
               4. The Place where it is to be done, IN EARTH.
               
                  Q. What deſire we in regard of the Rule?
               
               
                  A. 1. Knowledge of Gods Word.
                  Pſal. 119. 16. For in and by Gods Word
is his will reuealed:Col. 1. 9, 10. and knowledge thereof is the ground of
true obedience. Giue mee vnderstanding (ſaith the Pſalmiſt)
and I ſhall keepe thy Law:
                  Pſal. 119. 34. 
                  yea I ſhall keepe it with my whole
heart. Deſire of obedience without knowledge is very prepoſterous.
An ignorant mans practiſe is like a blind mans wandring
in by-wayes. How can it otherwiſe bee, but that ſuch
ſhould fall into many dangers.
               
                  
2. A Conformitie of our wils to Gods: or a readineſſe in our
will and heart to yeeld to whatſoeuer wee ſhall know to bee
Gods will.Pſal. 27. 8. When God ſaid to Dauid, Seeke my face, his
heart anſwered,Pſal. 119. 36. 
                  O Lord I will ſeeke thy face. For this was his
prayer, Incline mine heart vnto thy Teſtimonies. It is a proper
fruit of ſanctifying knowledge to draw the will to embrace as
good that which the vnderſtanding diſcerneth to be true.
               3. Strength of Memory to hold faſt Gods Word, and that in
the good directions and ſweet conſolations, in the precepts and
promiſes thereof.Pſal. 103. 17, 18. Where the Pſalmiſt ſaith, that the mercy of
the Lord is vpon thoſe that remember his commandements, to doe
them, Doth he not imply that to remember Gods Word, is
an eſpeciall helpe to the doing of it. Things not remembred are
as not knowne. The Apoſtle noteth this to be the cauſe of the
Hebrewes fainting in their troubles,Heb. 12. 5. that they forgate the direction
and conſolation of the Word.
               4. Life of Conſcience, both to cheere vs vp in doing the will
of God, and alſo to checke vs when we ſwerue from the ſame,
and not to ſuffer vs to be quiet till we turne to it againe. For
theſe are the proper functions of a conſcience quickened and
ſanctified. The Apoſtle noteth that they who giue themſelues
ouer to tranſgreſſe,1. Tim. 4. 2. haue their conſcience ſeared with an hot iron:
the life of it is taken away.
               5. Loue of Gods Word: that our hearts be ſo ſet vpon it, as
we make it our ioy and delight. This made Dauid ſo forward,
as hee was, to doe the will of God: for Gods Word was his
loue,
                  Pſal. 119. 97, 174, 162, 103, 72, 27. 
                  longing, ioy, delight, more ſweet then honey, more precious
then thouſands of gold, or ſiluer. This reaſon of doing Gods
will he himſelfe rendereth in theſe words, My ſoule hath kept
thy teſtimonies, for I loue them exceedingly. Loue ſetteth all the
power of a mans ſoule, and parts of his body on worke to
accompliſh that which is loued. But vnleſſe our heart and affections
be ſet vpon Gods Word, very hardly ſhall wee be
brought to doe it, becauſe it is contrarie to our naturall and
corrupt will.
               6, Renouation of our outward parts, that they may bee made
inſtruments in their ſeuerall functions, to execute Gods will:
that thus as there is a readineſſe to will,
                  2. Cor. 8. 11. ſo there may be a performance
                  
alſo:1. Theſ. 5. 23. and for this end to pray that we may be ſanctified
as in our whole ſpirit,Phil. 2. 13. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   ſo in bodie: and that he would work
in vs both to will and to doe. All the former without this are nothing.
This is the maine and principall thing here intended.Voluntatis vocabulum generaliter omnes virtutes inſe comprehendit ac quae ſingulatim per bonum intelliguntur, in voluntate Dei omnia anim aduertuntur. Greg. Nyſ. de Orat.
The other are but preparations and helpes thereunto.
               Here I might take occaſion to reckon vp all thoſe vertues
which in Gods Word are enioyned to vs. For Gods will
compriſeth vnder it all thoſe vertues: yea whatſoeuer may
truely be thought to bee good, is comprehended in the will of
God. But it is ſufficient thus in generall to haue pointed at
this head.
               
                  Q. What deſire wee in regard of the Reſtraint of the fore-named
rule in this word THY?
               
               A. A diſtinct vnderſtanding of the excellencie and perfection
of Gods will:Pſal. 119. 18. that ſo wee may addict our ſelues wholly to it:Pro. 30. 5, 6.
nor taking from it,Deut. 12. 32. nor adding to it. Had we indeed as good
an opinion, and as high an eſteeme of Gods will as Dauid had,
we would cleaue as cloſe to it as he did.
               2. A right diſcerning of the vanity and corruption of the creatures
will, eſpecially when it is not agreeable to Gods, but
ſwerueth from it.Pſal 94 11. In this reſpect it is ſaid, The Lord knoweth the
thoughts of man that they are but vanity:
                  Iob 5. 13. and, He taketh the wiſe
in their craftineſſe. If we could truely, and thorowly diſcerne as
much, would wee be ſo blockiſh as to preferre the will of any
man before Gods?
               3. A deniall of our owne will: a point which the wiſe man
much preſſeth,Pro. 3. 5, 7. in theſe and ſuch like prohibitions: Leane not to
thine owne vnderſtanding: Be not wiſe in thine owne eyes. Seldome
or neuer are ſelfe-conceited men brought to yeeld ſimple obedience
to Gods will. They will bee ſo inquiſitiue into the
ground and reaſon thereof, that if they be not ſatiſfied therein,
their owne will,Pro. 26. 12. and not Gods ſhall be done. There is more
hope of a foole then of ſuch an one.
               
               4. Mortification of the fleſh.
                  Gal. 5. 17. For the fleſh luſteth againſt the
Spirit, ſo that wee cannot doe the things that we would. When we
would doe the will of God,Rom. 7. 28, &amp;c. yea, and delight in the Law
of God after the inner man, wee ſhall finde the fleſh warring
againſt that Law of the minde, and bringing vs into captiuitie

to the law of ſinne. This made Saint Paul with ſo bitter
an exclamation to ſay, O wretched man that I am, who ſhall
deliuer me from the body of this death!
               
               
                  Q. What deſire wee in regard of the extent of the fore-named
Rule? (be done.)
               
                  A. 1. An accompliſhment of whatſoeuer God hath determined.
That what God willeth to be done may accordingly bee
done, whether the creature will it or nill it. For we ought to
beleeue that God wiſely willeth all things to the beſt: and
thereupon to deſire that his counſell and purpoſe may ſtand:
and euen from our hearts to ſay,Act. 21. 14. 
                  The will of the Lord be done.
                  2. Sam. 15. 26. 
                  Let him doe as ſeemeth good to him.
               
               2. A contented ſubmiſsion to euery thing which God bringeth
to paſſe. Hereof we haue worthy patternes in the examples of
Iob 1. 21. 
                  Iob,
                  1. Sam. 3. 18. 
                  Eli,
                  2. Sam. 16. 10. 
                  Dauid,
                  2. King. 20. 19. 
                  Hezekiah, and other Saints. Wee can
not be ignorant that euents doe declare the determined purpoſe
of God. When ſuch and ſuch a thing is falne out, we may
then conclude that God had ſo and ſo purpoſed it. For as Gods
Word declareth his approuing will, what he would haue: ſo
euents declare his peremptory will, what hee will haue. Our
ſubmiſſion therefore to Gods will is tried in both. This is to bee
applyed to all manner of croſſes, and loſſes, whether of goods
children, or other friends, to death it ſelfe, or to any other thing,
that may ſeeme bitter to vs.
               
                  Q. What deſire we in regard of the place here ſpecified for doing
the will of God, In earth?
               
               A. 1. Grace well to vſe the time of this mortall life. For the
time while wee abide on earth isIoh. 9. 4. 
                  the day wherein wee may
worke, andGal 6. 10. 
                  the time of doing good.
                  Ioh. 9. 4. 
                  Chriſt tooke the aduantage
of the day; and1 Phil. 2. 5. we ought to bee of the minde of Chriſt.
Thus ſhall wee ſhew that wee haue as great reſpect to Gods
honour, as to our owne happineſſe: and as great a deſire
to doe the worke appointed, as to receiue the reward promiſed.
               2. Vniuerſall ſubiection to Gods will throughout this world.
For this indefinite phraſe, in earth, ſheweth that our deſire
ought to bee extended to all that are on the face of the earth.
We pray not that Gods will be done only in our own houſe, or

in our owne countrey, or in the countries neere adioyning to
vs, but in earth.
                  1 Pſal. 67. 2, &amp;c. All the graces therefore before mentioned to
be craued for our ſelues, muſt alſo bee craued for euery member
of the militant Church.
            
            
               §. 74. Of the things to be prayed for in the direction
of the third Petition.
               WHat are we taught to pray for in regard of this direction,Quid eſt aliud dicere, Fiat vol

                  as
it is in heauen.
               
               
                  A. In generall a conformitie of the Church militant to the
Church triumphant. That, though theſe two parts of Gods
Church be in one place diſtant one from another, yet they may
bee of like minde and diſpoſition towards God and his will.
In this reſpect we are ſaid to be partakers of the heauenly calling:
and our conuerſation to be in heauen.
                  Heb. 3. 1.
               
               2. In particular ſuch a manner of obedience as is performed
by the Saints and Angels in heauen.Phil. 3. 20.
               
            
            
               §. 75. Of the diſtinct heads of the manner of doing
Gods will in heauen.
               Q. TO how many heads may their manner of obedience be
reduced?
               
                  A. To ſixe eſpecially: which are theſe that follow.
               1. Sinceritie.
                  1. Sinceritie. Whatſoeuer thoſe heauenly ſpirits make ſhew
of,Reu. 14. 5. they doe it from the heart. In their mouth is found no guile;
for they are without fault before the Throne of God.
                  —21. 27. None that
maketh alye can enter into that pure place.—22. 15. They are without,
whoſoeuer loue lies. All in heauen ſhine as the Sunne. They are
tranſparent:Mat. 13. 43. there is no couer for hypocriſie. This ſincerity did
Dauid deſire where he prayed that God would take from him
the way of lying:
                  Pſal. 119, 29, 36, 80. and encline his heart to his Teſtimonies, and let
it be vpright in his Statutes.
               2. Integritie:
                  2. Integritie Reu. 14. 4. which is an vniuerſall ſubiection to euery part
of Gods will. The heauenly ſpirits follow the Lambe whether
ſoeuer he goeth. In all places they attend vpon their Lord, and

                  alwayes behold his face,
                  Mat. 18. 10. to know what his will is that they may
doe it. They are therefore by a kinde of excellency ſaid to doe
his commandements,
                  Pſal. 103. 20 
                  hearkening to the voice of his Word. Neuer
was there any ſtop or ſtay in any that euer entred into heauen
at any thing that God willed to be done. This integritie alſo
did Dauid deſire, where he ſaid, Oh that my wayes were directed
to keepe thy Statutes!
                  Pſal. 119▪ 5, 6. 
                  then ſhall I not be aſhamed when I haue reſpect
to ALL thy commandements:
                  Deut. 5. 29. yea this did God himſelfe
earneſtly deſire for his people.
               3. Alacritie.
                  3. Alacritie. There is nothing wherein the heauenly ſpirits
ſhew more cheerefulneſſe then in doing Gods will. It is
muſicke and melodie to them. In which reſpect they are ſaid
to haue harps,
                  Reu. 15. 2. as a ſigne of their cheerefull minde and diſpoſition.Ioh 4. 34.
While Chriſt liued on earth, it was his meat to doe the will
of him that ſent him. Did hee not then doe it with cheerefulneſſe?
For this alacritie doth Dauid pray, where hee deſireth
God to quicken him.
                  Pſal. 119. 37, 88.
               
               4. Sedulitie.
                  4. Sedulitie. The heauenly Spirits are both diligent, and
alſo quicke and ſpeedy in executing the will of the Lord.Iſa▪ 6. 2. They
are thereupon ſaid to haue wings and to fly. Was not hee of
that minde who ſaid,Pſal. 119. 60. 
                  I made haſte and delayed not to keepe thy
Commandements? For this end doth the Church deſire Chriſt
to draw her,Cant. 1. 3. that ſhe might runne after him.
               5. Ardencie and zeale.
                  5. Ardency. The heauenly Spirits in regard of
their zeale are ſaid to bee a flaming fire.
                  Pſal. 104. 4. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     combuſsit. Inde 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   In which reſpect the
title Seraphim is giuen vnto them: for it is an Hebrew name
taken from heat and burning.Iſai. 6. 2. There is nothing that doth
more heat and enflame their loue, and delight, then Gods will.
When they know that God willeth this or that, they are all on
fire till it be done.Pſal. 119. 20.—32. This zeale was in him that ſaid, My ſoule
breaketh for the longing that it hath to thy iudgements alwayes.
And his expectation to haue his heart enlarged, ſheweth that
hee prayed for his holy zeale.Reu. 3. 19. 
                  Be zealous therefore.
               
               6. Constancie.
                  6. Conſtancie. The heauenly ſpirits ſerue God day and
night.
                  Reu. 7. 15. They waxe not weary of doing Gods will. As the good
Angels ſtill keepe their firſt eſtate: ſo the gloriſied Saints euer
abide in their eſtate.Pſal. 51. 12. &amp; 119. 116. None of them haue yet, nor euer will fall
away. This did hee pray for, who oft called vpon God to ſtabliſh

him. This conſtancie is the grace of all graces. It ſetteth
the crowne on all their heads: and bringeth men to the
fruition of the fruit of all:Reu. 2. 10. 
                  Be thou faithfull vnto the death, and
I will giue thee the crowne of life, ſaith he who can make good
what hee ſaith.
            
            
               §. 76. Of the things for which thankes is to be giuen
in the third Petition, and in the direction
annexed to it.
               
                  Q. WHat are the particulars for which we are to giue thanks
by vertue of the third Petition?
               
                  A. I. All thoſe graces whereby wee are enabled to doe the
will of God.Epheſ. 1. 3. As.
               1. Illumination of our minds, whereby we may vnderſtand
what is the will of God.1. Cor. 14. 5.
               
               2. Subiection of our will vnto Gods.2. Cor. 9. 13.
               
               3. Happineſſe of memory to keepe in mind the will of God:Pſal. 119. 52. 61.
that we forget it not, after we haue once knowne it.
               4. Faithfulneſſe of conſcience to cheere vs when wee doe
Gods will,1. Tim. 1. 12. and to checke vs when we tranſgreſſe it.
               5. Setledneſſe of heart and affections vpon Gods will.Pſal. 40. 8.
               
               6. Externall obedience in the ſeuerall parts of our bodie
theretoRom. 6. 17.
               
               7. Power ouer the fleſh that drawes vs from the will of
God.Rom. 7. 24, 25.
               
               II. All euents of what kind ſo euer, be they loſſes or other
croſſes, miniſter matter of Thankſgiuing: for they are compriſed
in the number of thoſe ALL THINGS for which we muſt
giue thankes.
                  Epheſ. 5. 20. For this (ſaith the Apoſtle) is the will of God:
                  1. Theſ. 5. 18. a reaſon
very proper and pertinent to our purpoſe. Thus did Iob
bleſſe God for taking away,Iob 1 21. as well as for giuing.
               Q. What matter of thankes doth the direction added to the
third Petition afford?
               
                  A. We ought to bee ſo much the more thankefull, by how
much the more heauenly our obedience is: as when it is ſweetned
with Sinceritie, ſeaſoned with Integritie, quickened with
Alacritie, enlarged with Sedulitie, inflamed with Ardencie,

followed and crowned with conſtancie. The more excellent the
graces be wherewith wee are enabled to doe Gods will, the
more matter of praiſe doe they afford. This was it that moued
Dauid to bleſſe and praiſe God againe and againe,1. Chron. 29, 10, 13, 19. that he
and his people offered according to the will of God willingly in
vprightneſſe of heart, and with ioy.
               
            
            
               §. 77. Of the duties to be obſerued; by reaſon of
the third Petition.
               
                  Q. VVHat duties ought we to endeuour after by vertue of
the third Petition?
               
                  A. 1. We ought to ſearch the Scripture that we may know
the will of God.1. Search the Scripture. For in them is the will of God contained.
This is that ſearching,
                  Prou. 2, 4, 5. to which knowledge and vnderſtanding
is promiſed. And for our better helpe herein, wee ought diligently
to frequent the Miniſterie of Gods Word: as it is noted▪
of the conuetted Iewes,Act. 2. 42. that they continued ſtedfaſtly in the
Apoſtles doctrine: whereby is declared that they were diligent
and conſtant hearers of the Apoſtles, and alſo faithfull profeſſors
and practiſers of their doctrine. The former was the cauſe
of the latter. The preaching of the Word is a great helpe to
bring vs to doe the, will of God: and that in a double reſpect.
Firſt, becauſe the will of God is thereby the more clearely, diſtinctly,
and fully opened vnto vs. Secondly, becauſe it is a
meanes ſanctiſied of God to breed credence to the truth of that
which is reuealed, and a
                     •
                  ſiance therein: yea, and to bow our
will, heart, and affections to yeeld thereto, and to bee ſetled
thereupon. In this reſpect ſaith the wiſedome of God, which
is eſpecially ſet forth in the preaching of his Word,Pro. 8. 33. 
                  Bleſſed is
the man that heareth me: watching dayly at my gates, waiting at
the poſts of my doores.
               
               2. We ought to hide Gods Word in our heart,
                  2. Remember the word. wee may not
careleſſely let it ſlip. So will all the fruit and benefit of our reading
and hearing be loſt,Pſal. 119. 11. as meate, or phyſicke that is vomited
vp ſo ſoone as it is taken.Heb. 2. 1. But by retaining Gods Word in
minde and memory, wee ſhall be prouoked the more to doe
Gods will, and kept from tranſgreſſing it: to which purpoſe

the Pſalmiſt ſaith,Pſal. 119. 11. 
                  Thy word haue I hid in mine heart, that I might
not ſinne againſt thee.
                  Col. 3. 16. Wherefore let the word of Chriſt dwell in you
richly.
               
               3. We ought oft and ſeriouſly to meditate on the excellencie of
Gods will,
                  3. Meditate on Gods word. to draw our hearts the more to it. Whoſe heart was
euer more ſet vpon Gods will to do it thenPſal▪ 119. 5, 20. 
                  Dauids? and who
did more—97, 99, 148. 
                  meditate on the excellencie thereof, then he? It was
his meditation day and night. The manyPſal. 19. 7. &amp;c. excellent properties
and effects which he doth attribute thereto: and the many
Pſal. 119. 72, 103, 127. 
                  ſweete and pretious things to which he doth preferre it, do ſhew
how excellent he accounted it to be.
               4.4. Vow. We ought by ſolemne vow and oathPſal. 119. 1
                        •
                     6. to bindour ſelues to
do Gods will. This is an eſpeciall meanes to keepe our words,
thoughts,2. Chro. 15. 
                        〈◊〉
                     , 14, 15. and actions within the compaſſe thereof. For ſacred
vowes,Neh. 10. 29. and oathes are as Tutors and Schoole-maſters, which
will oft put vs in minde of that which we haue vowed: and
when we are about to ſtart there-from they will reſtraine vs,
and hold vs in.
               5. We muſt keepe our owne will from rebelling againſt Gods.
                  5. Auoide rebellion.
There is naturally in our will an antipathie and contrary inclination
to Gods.Rom. 7 23. It is very prone to oppoſe and reſiſt the will
of God. As therefore we hold in head-ſtrong horſes with bit
and bridle, ſo muſt we hold in our owne will: no way yeelding
vnto it, but rather croſſing it, when it riſeth againſt Gods. This
is an eſpeciall branch of denying our ſelues.
                  
                     Math. 16. 24. Enitendum vt ſit nobis cum di
                        •
                      vna voluntas: &amp; quaecunque ei placent, placean
                        •
                      etiam &amp; nobis. Bern. in Quadr. Serm. 6.
               
               6 We ought to endeauour that our will may be one with
Gods (as Chriſts was, who ſought the will of his Father in
all things. Ioh. 5. 30.) and that whatſoeuer pleaſeth God,
may pleaſe vs: ſo ſhall the will of God bee done by vs indeed.
               7. We muſt lay it downe as a rule not to be altered,7. Preferre God before man. and as
an inuiolable law to obey God rather then man. For there is no
compariſon betwixt them. Yet is our fooliſh and corrupt heart
readie to yeeld to ſuch things as they who are ouer vs,Acts 4. 19. or from
whom we may expect any aduantage, will haue to be done, yea
though it be expreſly againſt Gods will. But the forenamed ſetled
reſolution will be an eſpeciall meanes to keepe vs, as it kept
the Apoſtles,
                  Acts 5. 29. from preferring mans will to Gods. Thus this

blocke being remoued out of the way, we ſhall much more readily
do the will of God.
               8. We ought ſtedfaſtly to beleeue that all things are ordered by
God:
                  8. Beleeue Gods prouidence. and that moſt wiſely. This is the beſt meanes that can be
preſcribed to bring vs to a contented ſubmiſſion to Gods determined
counſell and will manifeſted by euents.Rom 11. 36. He that beleeueth
that as God is a Lord of abſolute ſoueraignty doing
what he will (will or nill the creature) ſo he is a God of vnſearchable
wiſedome,Math. 10. 29. and infinite goodneſſe, ordering all
things to the beſt,Ier. 51. 15. will not grudge againſt that which God
doth. For he well knoweth that as there is a neceſſitie of yealding
to his will, becauſe it cannot be reſiſted, ſo there is alſo
great equitie therein, becauſe it cannot be bettered.
               9. We muſt euer be ſtriuing to do the will of God more and more:
                  9. Preſſe forward.
better and better. This dutie ariſeth from the patterne here ſet
before vs. While we are on earth we cannot attaine to the perfection
of them who are in heauen.Phil. 3. 13, 14. We muſt therefore forgetting
thoſe things which are behind, and reaching forth to thoſe things which
are before, preſſe toward the marke for the price of the high calling of
God in Chriſt Ieſus. And as we were taught before to deſire the
beſt gifts, and therein to ſeeke to excell, ſo for this end we
muſt ſtir vp the gifts of God in vs,2. Tim. 1. 6. and to the vttermoſt put forth
that ſpirituall ſtrength which the Lord is pleaſed to beſtow vppon▪
vs: wiſely obſeruing both what is to be done, and after
what manner it is to be done.
               10. We ought,10. Pron
                        •
                     ke others. as much as in vs lyeth, to prouoke others to do
the will of God. For we pray not onely for our ſelues, that we may
do it, but for others alſo, that it may be done euery where
through the earth. Our endeauour muſt be anſwerable to our
deſire. Therefore Miniſters, Magiſtrates, Parents, Tutors,
Schoole-maſters, Gouernours of families, and all that haue authoritie
and charge ouer others, muſt moſt eſpecially looke to
this: becauſe they haue beſt meanes to cauſe others to do the
will of God. Thus ſhall they the better diſcharge that charge
which is committed to them, and alſo much better accompliſh
the extent of that which is here deſired:1. Theſ. 5. 11. in which reſpect euen
priuate Chriſtians muſt alſo prouoke one another hereunto.Heb. 10. 24.

his word.
               
                  Q. VVHat are the things which we ought to bewaile by vertue
of the third Petition?
               
                  A. Both tranſgreſſions againſt the Petition it
ſelfe, and alſo againſt the Direction added thereto. Againſt the
Petition are all manner of ſins both againſt the reuealed word
of God, and alſo againſt the manifeſted workes of God.
               Sinnes againſt the reuealed word of God to be bewailed by
vertue of this Petition are ſuch as theſe.Sinnes againſt the word of God.
               
               1. Ignorance of Gods will reuealed by his word.1. Ignorance. Is it not a lamentable
caſe that the Creator ſhould be carefull to reueale his
whole counſell ſo farre forth as is requiſite for the happineſſe of
his creatures, and yet the creature be careleſſe in taking notice
thereof?Ier. 5. 4. This was a thing whereof the Prophets much complained.
And it is a matter for which we that liue vnder the
bright light of the Goſpell haue great cauſe to complaine.Hoſ. 4. 6. Neuer
was there more meanes of knowledge: yet very ſmall is the
meaſure of knowledge whereunto many haue attained.Quo pacto voluntatem dei praeuiam ſequar, vbi ignoro 
                        •
                     am. Bern, in Quadr. Serm 6. How
can it be thought that ſuch as know not the will of God ſhould
do it? Can he that knoweth it not, follow it as a guide?
               2. Obſtinacie of our will againſt Gods. This may be in ſuch as
know the will of God. Chriſt complaineth of the Iewes obſtinacie
againſt the good will of God made knowne to them.2. Rebellion of will. The
not doing of Gods will is hereby much aggrauated:Math 23. 37. and in that reſpect
the more to be bewailed.Luke 12. 47.
               
               3. Slipperineſſe of memory, whereby the will of God made
knowne is forgotten. By this the benefit of knowledge is loſt.
Ier. 2. 32. God much complaineth hereof: andHoſ. 4. 6. threatneth for this to
forget their children.
               
               4. Deadneſſe of Conſcience, which is the cauſe that men go on
in ſinne greedily and ſecurely. The Apoſtle complaineth that
men haue their conſcience ſeared with an hot iron:1. Tim. 4 2. who being paſt feeling,
giue themſelues ouer to laſciuiouſneſſe,Epheſ. 4. 19. to worke all vncleanneſſe
with greedineſſe.
               5. Hatred of Gods word, which is that light that ſheweth the

good will of God.Pro. 1 29. Wiſedome complaineth of theſe. There is
no hope that ſuch ſhould do the will of God: forIoh. 3. 20.

They are directly contrary to that which is deſired in this Petition.
Yet without hoe are theſe euery where, by all, of all ſorts
committed. O what cauſe haue we to be humbled for our owne
ſinnes, for the ſinnes of others that are vnder our charge, for the
ſinnes of our families, for the ſinnes of the Pariſh, Towne, Citie,
or Nation where we liue and for the ſinnes of the times wherewe
liue! In this reſpect we haue as great cauſe, as euer Ieremiah
had,Ier. 9. 1. to wiſh and ſay, Oh that mine head were waters, and mine
eyes a fountaine of teares, that I might weepe day and night for the

               2. Outward impatiencie.
               The former is the cauſe of the latter.1. Diſcontentedneſſe. It is noted of the Iſraelites
that firſt they tempted God in their hearts (namely by their
diſcontentednes at that prouiſion which he had made for them)
and then it is added,2. Impatiencie. that they ſpake againſt God: of both which
the Pſalmiſt there complaineth.Pſal. 78. 18.—19. When that which God cauſeth
to fall out, any way croſſeth our deſire, as when children or others
whom we loue are taken from vs, when ſickneſſe, paine,
penurie, or any other croſſe is laid vpon vs, then we grow diſcontented
in our minds, we mutter with our mouthes, and bewray
much impatiencie in our actions, and many times ſpare
not to blaſpheme the ſacred Name of God, and to ſay, as that
prophane King did,2. King. 6. 33. 
                  Behold, this euill is of the Lord: what ſhould I
waite for the Lord any longer? Who hath not cauſe in this reſpect

to be much humbled for the bitterneſſe of his owne and other
mens ſpirit, out of which much gall is oftentimes ſpit into the
very face of God himſelfe?

               §. 81. Of the meaning of this word BREAD.

                  Q. What points are here diſtinctly to be conſidered?
               A. 1. The Thing deſired,Though our Engliſh do otherwiſe place the words of this Petition, yet in the Originall Greeke and in the vſuall Latine

               A. All manner of temporall bleſſings.Vnder bread all temporall bleſſings. For
bread in his moſt vſuall and proper acceptation
ſignifieth an eſpeciall kind of foode whereby our
bodies are nouriſhed.Quandorogamus panem quotidianum, quicquid nobis propter carnem noſtram in terris neceſſarium eſt poſtulamus. Aug. H

                     m. 42 in l. 50. Hom. Why bread is put for all temporall bleſſings.
                   Yet ſo as by a Synecdoche
1. One kinde of foode is put for all other kindes: 2. One
meanes of refreſhing our bodies for all other meanes:
3. One temporall bleſſing for all ſorts of temporall bleſſings.
For there are ſo many temporall bleſſings whereof in this
world we ſtand in need, as it would haue bene too tedious to
haue reckoned vp euery particular by name. Wherefore Chriſt
contents himſelfe to mention onely one kind (Bread) which is
of all the moſt vſuall. Euery one, poore and rich, in all places,
vſe bread: and ſo haue they done in all ages, whether they liue
on fleſh,P

as foode, of all other temporall things is the moſt neceſſarie, ſo
bread, of all other kinds of foode. WherePſal. 104. 15. other things refreſh
a man, this ſtrengthens him: and hath therefore very fitly the ſtile
ofPſal. 105. 16. 
                  ſtaffe attributed to it. The want of no temporall thing

brings a man to ſuch diſtreſſe as the want of Bread:Gen. 41. 54, 55. which eſpecially
cauſeth famine, wherupon by a kind of property it is
calledAmo. 8. 11. 
                  a famine of Bread. Vnder this title, Bread, are compriſed
meate and drinke; yea, food, raiment, ſleepe, phyſicke, and
other things needfull for our bodies,Panem cum dicit omnia quae corpori neceſſariae ſunt comprehendit. Greg. Nyſ. de Orat. euen for preſeruing, or recouering
the health and ſtrength of them: and ſuch a competent
eſtate alſo, as is meete for the place wherein God hath ſet
vs, for the charge of children and others which hee hath committed
to vs, and for that function and worke which hee hath
appointed for vs: together with peace, and all manner of proſperitie.
In a word, whatſoeue▪ is needfull and vſeful for mans
temporall eſtate in this world, is here compriſed vnder this one
particle BREAD. AndGen. 3. 19. moſt vſually in Scripture is it put forDeut. 8. 3. 82.
temporall bleſſings.See §. 82. If at any time it bee put for Spirituall
food,2. Sam. 3. 29. there is ſome circumſtance or other that neceſſarily implyeth
as much,Iob 15. 23.—27. 14. and plainely demonſtrateth that there it can
not be meant of corporall food.Pſal. 37. 25. But there being no ſuch circumſtance
in this Petition,Pro. 12. 11.—20. 13.—31. 14. it is ſafeſt to take it in the literall,
vſuall, and proper ſence. If it be not here ſo taken, this forme
of Prayer is defectiue,Ier. 44. 17. and compriſeth not in it all things requiſite
to bee prayed for.Ezec. 16 49. For it is moſt requiſite to pray for
temporall bleſſings, as ſhall§. 83. afterwards be proued.
            
            
               §. 82. Of the Arguments alleadged for Spirituall
Food to be meant by Bread, anſwered.
               THey certainely miſtake the meaning of this Petition, who
in this place apply this title BREAD to Chriſt Ieſus the
Spirituall Manna, which is thatIoh. 6. 33. 
                  Bread of God that commeth
downe from Heauen, and giueth life vnto the world. Though in the
ſixt of Iohn, Bread be taken in that myſticall ſence; yet is it not
in that place ſingly and ſimply vſed, but with ſuch a deſcription
as plainely pointeth out the myſticall meaning of it, as
Ver. 33. 
                  Bread of God,
                  Ver. 50. 
                  Bread from heauen,

Bread,
                  Ver. 33. 
                  Bread that giueth life to the world, which Chriſt expreſly
applying to himſelfe, ſayth,Ver 48. 
                  I am the Bread of life. In that
place therefore it cannot but be myſtically meant. But here in

this Petition there is no ſuch circumſtance
to point out any ſuch
myſterie.

                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , whereby ſome thinke that more then ordinary earthly bread is meant, See §. 86.
                     Where the double article 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         is preſſed to prooue as much, It is well knowne that ſuch articles do oft redound: or are vſed meerely for grace of ſpeech. But it may be granted, that here it implieth ſome emphaſis, and yet no ſuch myſterie as is pretended to be included therein.
                     Of the order in placing it before iuſtification and ſanctification See §. 97.
                  
               
               The chiefeſt arguments alledged
for that myſticall interpretation
are theſe.
               1. Arg. If Bread be not here
put for Chriſt, then the chiefeſt
good thing that poſſibly we can
deſire is left out of this prayer.
               
                  Anſw. 1. Chriſt as the very
foundation, and roote of euery
good thing, is included in the
firſt clauſe of this prayer. For in
Chriſt is God our Father.
                  Eph. 5. 23.
               
               2. Chriſt being the Head of the
Church, he is expreſly prayed for
in the ſecond Petition.
               2. Arg. Temporall bleſſings are promiſed as additaments
to the kingdome of God.Math. 6. 33. They need not therefore by name be
prayed for.
               
                  Anſw. That followeth not. So they be not preferd before
the kingdome of God and his righteouſneſſe, they may expreſly
by for name be prayed for. Beſide the warrantable practiſe
ofGen. 28. 20. 
                  Iaakob,
                  Pro. 30. 8. 
                  Agur, and other Saints, the Apoſtle commandeth
toIam. 5. 14, 15. 
                  pray for ſuch as are ſicke, that they may be healed.
               Others obſeruing that temporall bleſſings may not be excluded,
apply this title Bread,
                  Cypr. de Orat. dom. §. 13. both to ſpirituall and alſo to corporall
foode.Greg. Nyſſ. de Orat. But this is to confound things of far different kinds
in a forme where Chriſt doth very accuratly diſtinguiſh things
that differ one from another.
               As for Papiſts who apply this to the Sacrament of the body
and bloud of Chriſt,Aug. in Enchir. cap. 115. they inferre thereby that the Lord ſhould
teach his diſciples to pray for that which was not then inſtituted,Rhem. Annot. on Mat. 6. 11.
and whereof they were vtterly ignorant.
            
            
               
               §. 83. Of praying for temporall bleſsings.
               
                  Q. VVHat are wee taught by the mention of BREAD
in this Prayer?
               
                  A. Temporall things are to be prayed for. Beſide
the warrant of this Petition, and ofGen. 28. 20. other prayers of
Saints guided therein by Gods Spirit,Pro. 30. 8. wee haue expreſſe
Pſal. 50. 15. precepts,Iam. 5. 14. 15. and promiſes, whereupon to ground our faith in
this caſe. On theſe grounds the Saints that haue called vpon
God for temporall bleſſings, haue alſo§. 101. giuen thankes to God
the giuer of them. For
               1. Theſe are1. Tim. 4. 4. good things in themſelues.
               2. They are very needfull and vſefull. Needfull (as meanes
ſanctified of God▪) for preſeruing our being in the world,
which like a Lampe would ſoone be extinguiſhed if continuall
ſupply of new oyle were not added thereto. In which reſpect
they who beſtow the things of this world, on ſuch as
want them, are ſaid toRom. 12. 13. contribute to their neceſſities. Vſefull
they are for enabling vs the better to do the worke which God
appointeth to vs.
               3. The want of them is a great hinderance to the worke of
our calling, to workes of charitie and piety, andPro
                        •
                     . 30. 9. a temptation
to iniuſtice.
               Herein then the goodneſſe of God in affoording to vs euery
thing needfull for body as well as for ſoule, and for this preſent
life, as well as for the life to come, is euidently ſet forth: and
hereby we may and ought to take the more notice thereof.
            
            
               §. 84. Of mens right to the things of this world.
               
                  Q. HOw is bread ſaid to be OVRS?
               
               
                  A. In regard of a iuſt and true right that wee haue
thereunto:Spirituall right to the things of this world. which right is two-fold: ſpirituall and ciuill. The ſpirituall
right is proper to the Saints that beleeue in Chriſt. For
Gen. 1. 28, 29. that right which God gaue to Adam vnto all things vnder
heauen,—3. 17. was forfeited by ſinne. But Chriſt the Lord &amp; heire of
all, vniting them that beleeue in him as members of his myſticall
body, thereby giueth them aIus i

                      re. 
                  new right to all that Adam
loſt. On this ground the Apoſtle ſaith to the faithfull,c 1. Cor. 3. 22, 23

                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
                  The world, things prefent, and things to come are yours. Of which
right he giueth this reaſon, Ye are Chriſts.
               
               The ciuill right is that which is agreeable to iuſtice and equitie,Ius ad rem. and that in the courts of men. Thus children haue a
right to the inheritance,Ciuill right to the things of this world. and portion which their Parents leaue
them: which right Naboth had to the Vineyard which Ahab
vniuſtly coueted.1. King. 21. 3. Thus they who bona fide purchaſe a
thing haue right to it,Gen. 23. 16, 17, &amp;c. as Abram to the field of Ephron, and
the Caue in it. Thus haue men a right to that which they by
Gods bleſſing on their honeſt diligence, in their lawfull calling
get:Gen. 30. 40. as Iacob had to the party-coloured ſheepe, which his vncle
as wages allowed to him. Thus that which is giuen to a man
by the owners thereof hee hath a right vnto:Iob 42. 11. as Iob had to
the gifts which his friends beſtowed vpon him. And ſundry
other wayes there bee agreeable to iuſtice and equitie, whereby
wee haue a right to the goods of this world before
men.
               Now both the fore-named kindes of right muſt concurre
to make a thing truely and properly a mans owne. They
that are not Chriſts, haue no right to any thing at all before
God: but are vſurpers of whatſoeuer they poſſeſſe and vſe.
Vnto the vnbeleeuing is nothing pure.
                  Tit. 1. 15. They that are Chriſts,
though they haue a right to all things, yet they may poſſeſſe
and vſe no more then what they can iuſtifie to be theirs before
men, and that in iuſtice and equitie. Their generall right
in Chriſt is to giue them libertie to hold and occupie ſo
much as God by the hand of his prouidence ſhall reach
out vnto them.Tu da panem. i. ex iuſtis laboribus cibum adipiſcar. Nam ſi Deus iuſtitia eſt, non habet a Deo panem, qui exre fraudulenter &amp; iniuſtè parta cibumhabet. Greg. Nyſſ. de Orat. Iuſtice is this hand of Gods prouidence.
That which vniuſtly is gotten, can not properly bee ſaid to
be giuen by God. It is with Saints as with an onely child and
heire while his father liueth: though he haue a right to all that
his father hath, yet may he not poſſeſſe and vſe any more then
his father allotteth to him.

                  Q. VVHat are wee giuen to vnderſtand by ſtiling bread
Ours?
               
               
                  A. Two things eſpecially.
               1. The Saints haue in Chriſt a true right to the things of this
world.
                  The right of Saints to temporall things. They who are taught to ſay, Our Father in Chriſt (which
all the Saints, and none but Saints can doe) are alſo taught to
ſay,Tit. 1. 15. 
                  Our bread, (For to the pure are all things pure.) which is a
good motiue to draw vs vnto Chriſt, that ſo wee may with
good conſcience vſe whatſoeuer the Lord by his prouidence
ſhall beſtow vpon vs.
               2. We may not deſire that which is anothers.
                  That which is anothers, not to be coueted. For wee are here
taught to pray for that which we may call ours. Now we iuſtly
ſo call nothing, but that whereunto we haue a ciuill, as well as
a ſpirituall right. The Morall Law expreſſely forbiddeth to
couet that which is anothers.Exod. 20. 17.
               
               By this word of propertie,All things not common to all. 
                  Our, the Anabaptiſticail conceit
of a communitie of all things is euidently refuted. And we are
taught to reſt contented with that portion which the Lord is
pleaſed to allot vs as our owne.
                  Contentment.
               
            
            
               
               §. 86. Of the meaning of this word DAILY.
               
                  Q. WHat is meant
by this word
DAILY?
               
               
                  A. Ordinary and vſuall
bread, whereof we
doe euery day ſtand in
need,
                     
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . This word is very ambiguous. The vulgar Latine tranſlates it ſuperſubſtantialem, as if 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         were put for 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . Which many following doe expound this Petition of that bread of God which came down from heauen, euen Ieſus Chriſt. Whereof ſee §. 82.
                     Others make the notation to bee 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , ad ſubſtantiam, q. d. 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , bread helpfull to our ſubſtance, or fit and meet to nouriſh vs. Thus is it anſwerable to that phraſe vſed by the Wiſe-man, Pro. 30. 8. 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         
                        Panis praeſcripti, vel demenſi mei (i) mihi praeſcriptus, aut mihi ſuctentando idoneus. The Syriack Tranſlater of the New Teſtament ſeemeth to follow this ſenſe, who thus expreſſeth it, 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         
                        panem neceſſitatis noſtrae, that which wee haue dayly need of. Others deriue this word 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         from 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , the participle of 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         
                        adſum, vel ſupersto, vel ſubſequor, whence the morrow is called 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         
                        ſcil. 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , Thus it ſignifieth bread needfull for the preſent, panem advenientem, as Saint Auguſtine acknowledgeth the Greeke word to ſignifie, though he tranſlates it ſuperſubſtantialem. Serm, 18. de verb. Dom. Latinus hunc panem quotidianum dixit, quia Graeci dicunt advenientem. And in Enchir. c. 116. Panis quotidianus ideo dictus eſt, quia hic eſt neceſſarius. The common Tranſlation of the word, quotidianum, daily, may wel ſtand with either of the two latter notations. Anſwerably to the common Tranſlation: Saint Cyprian termeth it diurnam cibam, dayly food. Cypr. de Orat. Dom. §. 14.
                   being fitteſt for
our ſubſtance, to preſerue
ſoule and body
together, &amp; to nouriſh
and cheriſh vs here in
this life. Thus it importeth
the very ſame
thing that the Wiſe
man ſetteth out vnder
this phraſe,Pro. 30. 8. Bread of
my allowance, or conuenient
for me. This word
is thus here vſed to diſtinguiſh
the food here
meant, from that which
Ioh. 6. 27, 33, 35.—4. 14. 
                  comming downe from
heauen endureth to euerlaſting life, whereof
whoſoeuer eateth ſhall
neuer bee hungry, or
thirſt againe: and to
preſcribe a meane to
our deſire.
            
            
               
               §. 87. Of deſiring no more then is needfull.
               VVHat inſtruction are we taught by this word DAILY?
                  Quaerere iubemur id quod ſatis ſit ad naturam corporis conſervandam, panem da ad Deum dicentes, non luxum &amp;c. Greg. Nyſſ. de Orat.
               
               
                  A. Our deſire muſt be for no more then is needfull
for vs. On this ground the Apoſtle aduiſeth to be1. Tim. 6. 8. 
                  content hauing
food and raiment. Thus was the deſire ofGen. 28. 20. 
                  Iaakob,
                  Pro 30. 8. 
                  Agur,
and other Saints moderated.1. Tim. 6. 9. Things needfull. Superfluitie is very dangerous.
It is Satans baite whereby he allureth and beguileth many: his
ſnare whereby hee catcheth and houldeth them faſt: his hooke
whereby he pulleth them downe, and drowneth them in perdition.
               Q. What may be accounted needfull?
               
                  A. 1. That which very nature requireth: as meate and
drinke to feed the body, and cloathing to keepe it warme:
Lam. 4. 4, 5. without theſe the body cannot but pine away and periſh.
               2. That which is meet for the eſtate wherein God hath ſet
vs: as fit inſtruments for Artificers: bookes for ſchollers:
amunition for Captains, and other Souldiers: yea alſo for publike
perſons, and for men of great birth, place, and dignitie,
ſuch ſufficiencie as is fit for the ſame. Thus much the Wiſe-man
intendeth vnder this phraſeProu. 30. 8. 
                  Gine me not pouertie. A man may
haue to ſuſtaine nature, and yet be poore.
               3. That which is requiſite for the charge committed to vs. As
if a man haue wife, and children, that which is m
                     •
                  et for them,
as well as for himſelfe, may iuſtly bee accounted needfull: ſo
for others of his houſhold and kindred lying on his charge.
1. Tim. 5. 8. The Apoſtle pronounceth him worſe then an Infidell that prouideth
not for his owne, and ſpecially for them of his owne houſe.
It behooueth vs therefore to pray for ſo much as may be ſufficient
for them for whom we ought to prouide.
               4. That which is apparently needfull for the time to come.
                  2. Cor. 12. 14. 
                  Fathers ought to lay vp for their children.
                  Gen. 41. 48, 49. When Ioſeph foreſaw
ſeuen yeeres Famine to come, hee laid vp great plenty of
corne before hand.
            
            
               
               §. 88. Of Couetouſneſſe, Ambition, and
Voluptuouſneſſe.
               COntrarie to the forenamed moderation of our deſire is Couetouſneſſe,Auarus homo ſimilis eſt inferno. Sicut infermus nunquam dicit, ſatis eſt, ita auarus nunquam ſatiatur, &amp;c. Bern. de modo bene viuen. Serm. 44. which like to hell can neuer bee ſatisfied.
For by aboundance this deſire is encreaſed; ſo as the more it
is filled, the leſſe it is ſatisfied. Hereof our Lord aduiſeth to
Luke 12. 15. 
                  take heed and beware. For as it is an vnſatiable ſinne, ſo alſo a
deuouring ſinne; as Pharaohs leane Kine deuoured the fat
ones, ſo Couetouſneſſe deuoureth all Gods bleſſings and graces,Gen. 41. 4. itMath. 13. 22. Ezek. 33. 31. 
                  choaketh the Word, and maketh hearers thereof vnfruitfull.
It ſo intangleth men with the things of this world, as
it maketh itLuke 14. 18. 
                  eaſier for a Camell to goe thorow the eye of a needle,
then for a rich man to enter into the Kingdome of God. No ſinne
more bewitcheth a man, drawing his heart from God the only
true ground of confidence,Mar. 10. 25. and making him truſt in vanitie
which is plaineCol. 3. 5. Ephe
                        •
                      5. 5. 
                  idolatry. Yea it is truely ſtiled.1. Tim. 6. 10. 
                  The roote
of all euill. For it ſo blindeth mans minde, and hardeneth his
heart, as he maketh conſcience of no ſinne: no not of denying
God, and renouncing true Religion: nor of periurie, and blaſphemie:
nor of prophaning and breakiug the Sabbath: nor of
rebellion againſt Superiours, and neglect of inferiours: nor of
murther or any other vnmercifulneſſe, nor of oppreſſion, deceit,
falſhood, or any other euill.
               Contrary alſo to the forenamed moderation of deſire, are
Ambition or affectation of worldly honours and promotions,
which like a winde make a man fwell aboue that which is
meet, but yet fill him not: and Voluptuouſneſſe, or an eager
hunting after earthly pleaſures and delights, wherewith hee
vſeth to be ſooner wearied then contented.
            
            
               §. 89. Of Gods giuing temporall bleſsings. That
he giueth them. How he giueth them.
               
                  Q. OF whom are we taught to aske bread?
               
                  A. Of our Father which is in heauen. For all the
Petitions of this Prayer are directed to him.
               
                  
                  Q. What is thence to be gathered?
               A,Pſa. 102. 19 20 
                  The Lord in heauen is the diſpoſer of all things on earth.
ForGen. 14 22. Pſal. 24. 1. 
                  hee is the poſſeſſor of heauen and earth. 
                  c 
                  The earth is the
Lords, and the fulneſſe thereof. He therefore giueth the earth and
the things thereof to whom he will. Wee neither haue them of
our ſelues, nor can haue them of any other but of God. Whatſoeuer
the meanes of getting them be, they are but the hands
of Gods prouidence, whereby he giueth vs what we haue.
               
                  Q. How doth God giue bread, and the things here compriſed
vnder it?
               
                  A. 1. By cauſing them to be brought forth.
                  How God giueth temporall bleſsings. For God at firſt
made euery thing that is fit for mans vſe: and hee continueth
ſtill to cauſe the earth, ſea, and other like meanes to bring forth
all things needfull for man.Pſal. 104. 14. 
                  I will heare, ſaith the Lord, I will
heare the heauens,
                  Hoſ. 2 21, 22. 
                  and they ſhall heare the earth, and the earth ſhall
heare the corne, and the wine, and the oile, and they ſhall heare Iezreel.
God is there ſet forth as the d 
                  firſt mouer,
                  A Primus Motor. and the higheſt
orderer and diſpoſer of all ſecondary meanes, whereby things
meet for man are brought forth.
               2. By bringing them to vs, ſo as wee may partake of the vſe
of them.Hoſ▪ 2. 8. Thus ſaith God to Iſrael, I gaue her corne, and wine,
and oyle, &amp;c. It is the ſame God to whom the Pſalmiſt ſaith,
The eyes of all things wait vpon thee,
                  Pſal. 145. 15. 
                  O Lord, and thou giueſt them
their meat in due ſeaſon.
               
               3. By giuing them a bleſſing. Such a bleſſing doth God giue
to the things which are brought forth, and brought to vs, as
by vertue thereof they nouriſh and cheriſh vs. This bleſſing is
in Scripture ſtiledLeu 26. 26. Iſa. 3. 1. the ſtaffe and ſtay of bread. This is that
Deut. 8. 3. 
                  Word of God by which man liueth. By this man thriueth. For
Prou. 10. 22. 
                  the bleſſing of God maketh rich. Whence this prouerbe hath
beene raiſed, Giue me Gods bleſſing, and caſt mee into the Sea.
In regard of this bleſſing they who haue aboundance haue
need to make this Petition. ForLuke 12. 15. 
                  a mans life conſiſteth not in the
aboundance of the things which he poſſeſſeth,
                  e Hag 1. 6. Pſal. 127. 1, 
                        •
                     . without Gods bleſſing
nothing can doe him any good.
               4. By ſanctifying them to vs. This is done 1. by accepting
our perſons in Chriſt, and accounting vs pure.Tit. 1. 15. 
                  To the pure all
things are pure. 2. By giuing vs in Chriſt a right to what wee

haue.1. Cor. 3. 22, 23 
                  All things are theirs who are in Chriſt. 3. By giuing vs
a warrant out of the Word for enioying and vſing the ſame.
1. Tim. 4. 5. 
                  It is ſanctified by the Word of God and Prayer. 4. By giuing
vs grace well to vſe what wee haue. By vertue of this grace.
Phil. 4. 12. Saint Paul was inſtructed both to be full, and to be hungry; both
to abound and to ſuffer need.
               
               Though in the three firſt reſpects, namely, by cauſing things
fit for creatures to be brought forth, by bringing them to his
creatures, and by giuing a nouriſhing vertue to them, God may
truely be ſaid to giue bread to all ſorts of men, good and euill:
yea to all ſorts of creatures, reaſonable and vnreaſonable: yet
in the laſt reſpect, namely by ſanctifying it, he giueth bread to
the Saints alone.
            
            
               §. 90. Of the inſtructions taught vs by asking
bread of God.
               IN that we are directed to aske bread of our Father in heauen,
we are taught thereby:
               1.1. Chron. 29. 11, &amp;c. To acknowledge him the giuer thereof.
               2.Pſal. 145. 15. In all want to fly to him.
               3.Pſa. 147. 12, 13. To giue the praiſe of all we haue to him.
               4.Prou. 3. 9. To honour him with our ſubſtance,
               5.Hoſ. 2. 5. To aſcribe nothing that we haue to any falſe gods, as
the idolatrous Iſraelites did.
               6.Deut. 8. 17. Nor to our owne power, asDan. 4. 30. proud Nebuchadnezzar.
               
               7.Act. 24. 2, 3. Not to other men, as flattering Tertullus.
               
            
            
               §. 91. Of Gods free-giuing the things
of this world.
               Q. ON what ground doe we aske bread of God?
               
                  A. Meerely on the free grace of God. This word
GIVE doth import as much. For what is more free then
gift.
               
               Q. What doth Chriſt hereby teach vs?
               A. All that wee haue commeth from the free gift of God.
                  Rom. 11. 35. For
who hath giuen to him firſt? We neither can deſerue any thing of

God: nor repay any thing to him. Well, did Iaakob vnderſtand
this leſſon,Gen. 32. 10. which made him acknowledge himſelfe leſſe then all
Gods mercies, and vnworthy of the leaſt of them.
               We ought hereby to be ſtirred vp to more thankfulneſſe,1. Chro. 29. 13, 14, 15. as
Dauid was. For the freer a gift is, the better it is: the more acceptable
to him that receiueth it, and the more worthy of praiſe
to be rendred to him that giueth it.
            
            
               §. 92. Of praying both for our ſelues and
for others.
               
                  Q. VVHat perſons are compriſed vnder this particle V s?
               
               
                  A. All they whoſe Father God is. For OVR
in the Preface, and V s in the three laſt Petitions,
import the very ſame perſons.
               Q. What learne we from this manner of expreſſing the parties
prayed for in the firſt perſon, and plurall number, V s?
               
               
                  A. In Prayer we muſt be mindfull both of our ſelues, and of others
alſo. It is vſuall with the Saints ſo to expreſſe their deſires, as
they ſhew thereby they haue reſpect to themſelues, and to others
too. Sometimes therefore hauing in the ſingular number
prayed diſtinctly for themſelues, they adde thereto Petitions
for others: as where Dauid thus in particular prayed for himſelfe,
Keepe my ſoule,
                  Pſal. 25. 20, 22. 
                  and deliuer me, he addeth, Deliuer Iſrael,
O God, &amp;c.
               For our ſelues we muſt eſpecially pray on theſe grounds.
               1. Euery one is neareſt to himſelfe. And this is the tenour
of the law,Math. 22. 39. 
                  Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe. If then thou
prayeſt for any, oughteſt thou not much more for thy ſelfe?
               2. Euerie one (if at leaſt he be not blinded in his minde)
beſt knoweth his owne needs, and is moſt ſencible of his owne
wants, according to the Prouerb, The foote beſt knoweth where the
ſhooe moſt pincheth. Not vnfitly to this purpoſe may this principle
be applied, what man knoweth the things of a man, ſaue the ſpirit
of a man which is in him. Who can beter know when a man is
hungrie or thirſtie, or what he beſt relliſheth, then himſelfe?
               3. Euery ones prayer is moſt effectuall for himſelfe. No faithfull

prayer made for ones ſelfe will God reiect: but Moſes and
Samuel,
                  Ier. 15. 1. or Noah, Daniel, and Iob may pray for others, and yet
deliuer but their owne ſoules.Ezek. 14. 14.
               
               
                  See the whole Armour of God on Eph. 6. 18. Treat. 3 § 36. 
                  Of praying for others ſee before in §. 14. the fourth dutie.
               This of the generall Doctrine gathered out of this particle v s,
being common to the three laſt Petitions made for mans good.
The perſons here intended are further to be conſidered in a
more particular relation to this fourth Petition.
            
            
               §. 93. Of praying for others outward well-fare
               
                  Q. VVHat doth the mention of others beſides our ſelues, in
this Petition for temporall bleſſings, teach v s?
               
               A. We muſt as truly deſire the outward wel-fare of
others,
                  Ier. 29. 7. 
                  as our owne. This precept of the Prophet, Seeke the peace
of the Citie, and pray vnto the Lord for it, is very pertinent to this
purpoſe. For by peace he meaneth eſpecially outward proſperitie.
So doth the Pſalmiſt,Pſal. 122. 6. where he ſaith, Pray for the peace of
Ieruſalem: for he addeth, Peace be within thy walles, and proſperitie
within thy palaces. This might eaſily be exemplified by a particular
enumeration of all thoſe temporall bleſſings which we may
pray for in our owne behalfe, applyed to prayers for
others.
               Others are of the ſame mould whereof we are, and ſubiect
to the ſame infirmities: they are ſupported and ſuſtained by the
ſame meanes that we are: and they ſtand in need of temporall
bleſſings as well as we. Theſe therefore muſt be prayed for in
their behalfe.
               This is the rather to be noted, becauſe many who can be well
content to pray for others ſpirituall wel-fare, faile exceedingly
in praying for their temporall wel-fare: which ariſeth from too
much loue of themſelues, and of this world. Men ordinarily are
ſo addicted to this world, as, if it were poſſible, they would
wholly haue it to themſelues. They deſire not therefore to haue
it much communicated to others. As for grace they obſerue it
to be as communicable as light. No man hath the loſſe by the
abundance of another. It rather encreaſeth by communication
and participation. They care not therefore how much others

haue thereof. But the things of this world are of another nature.
The more of them is giuen to ſome, the leſſe remaineth
for others. This maketh many the leſſe forward to pray for the
temporall eſtate of others. Let theſe two peſtiferous rootes,
Loue of our ſelues, and loue of this world be rooted out of our
hearts, and the forenamed dutie of praying for the temporall
wel-fare of others will be much more readily, and heartily performed.
               From hence by neceſſarie and iuſt conſequence it followeth,Others to be releeued with the bread that wee haue.
that we ought to ſuccour one another with the goods of this
world, according to the rule of loue, which is, our brothers neceſſitie,
and our owne abilitie. For what we pray for in the behalfe
of others, wee muſt to our power endeauour to do for
them. This is alſo the rather to be noted, becauſe many who
are readie to miniſter ſpirituall comfort to others, as to inſtruct
them, to encourage them, to ſtrengthen them in grace and
godlineſſe, and by Chriſtian reproofe to pull them out of the
way of perdition, yea and to exhort others to be mercifull and
bountifull in diſtributing to the poore, are very backwards
themſelues to giue of the goods of this world which they haue,Iam. 1. 26, 27. &amp; 2. 14. &amp;c.
to ſuch as need. Surely ſuch mens religion is vaine, and their
pretence of faith and loue a meere pretence,1. Ioh. 3. 17. the loue of God
doth not dwell in him.

the things of this world teach vs?
               
                  
                  A. We muſt be content with the things that are preſent. For God
himſelfe hath ſaid,Heb. 13. 5. Per id quod hodie iubet, intordicit tibi curam de Craſtino. Greg Nyſſ

ſufficient to worke contentment, I know not what can be ſufficient.

                  Q. VVHat is to be obſerued about the order of the fourth
Petition?
               
                  A. 1. That which is common with the Petitions
following.
               2. That which is proper to it ſelfe.
               
                  Q. What is it that is common with the Petitions following?
               
                  A. The fit inference of ſuch Petitions as concerne our good
vpon ſuch as concerne the glorie of God. For as in the three
Petitions before this, we are taught to ſeeke the things of God,
ſo in this and the two following, the things which tend to our
owne good.
               
                  Q. What learne we from that inference?
               A. It is lawfull to ſeeke ſuch things as tend to our owne good,
                  Things for our ſelues may be ſought. 
                  as
well as ſuch as tend to the glorie of God. Can a better warrant then
this platforme of prayer be expected? To adde other proofes,
whereof the Scripture affoordeth many, were to light candles
in Sun-ſhine.
               Behold here the good reſpect that God heareth to man.Gods reſpect to vs.
Though he might vſe vs as gally-ſlaues, &amp; other ſlaues are vſed,
wholly and onely for his owne turne, yet doth he not denie vs
libertie to ſeeke our ſelues, and our owne good. Yea if the ſeruices
which we performe to him, hinder our good indeed, hee
will that they giue place to this: and on that ground he ſaith, I

will haue mercie,
                  Math. 12. 7. 
                  and not ſacrifice. And againe, The Sabbath was
made for man,
                  Mar. 2. 27. 
                  and not man for the Sabbath.
               
               Should not this enflame our hearts with zeale of the glorie
of God?Our gratefulnes to God. Should we not hereupon be euen eaten vp, as Chriſt
was?Ioh. 2. 17. Moſt meete it is that Gods goodneſſe to vs worke gratefulneſſe
in vs to him.
               As in reſpct of God this requireth gratefulneſſe,Prouidence for our ſelues. ſo in reſpect
of our ſelues, prouidence: that we be not careleſſe in ſeeking
that for our ſelues,Omnia bonum appetunt. which God in his care ouer vs giueth vs libertie
to ſeeke. Ordinarily men are giuen to ſeeke their owne
good.Ariſt. Ethic. lib. Yea nature inclineth euery thing to ſeeke that which is
good for it ſelfe:1. cap. 1. &amp; 4. ſo as I need not vſe many words to preſſe this
point.Phil. 2 22. Moſt faile in ſeeking their owne too much. Yet there
are alſo failings in the defect, and that both of ſuch as§. 157. neglect
their beſt and trueſt good concerning their eternall ſaluation,
and alſo of ſuch as neglect euen their§. 103. temporall eſtate.
            
            
               §. 96. Of the principall end of this life.
               
                  Q. VVHat are the things proper to this Petition,The end of our life to glorifie God. to be obſerued
about the order of it?
               A. 1. The inference of ſuch things as concerne
this preſent life,Quia nondum perfectione gaudentes, non ſine magno labore diuinae poſſumus obtemperare volunlati, opus eſt cibo ne deficiamus: opus eſt, inquam, pane qu

               2. The placing of things temporall before ſpirituall.
               
                  Q. What are we taught by that inference.
               
               A. The end of this life is to glorifie God. For being taught to
pray for ſuch things as tend to the glorie of God, wee are
thereupon taught to pray for bread, that our life may be preſerued
to that end. Directly to this purpoſe the Pſalmiſt thus
prayeth,Pſal. 119. 175. 
                  Let my ſoule liue, and it ſhall praiſe thee. This moued
Iſa. 38. 1, 2, 3. 18, 19. 
                  Hezekiah to pray for life when he had receiued the ſentence of
death, as may be gathered out of this reaſon, The graue cannot
praiſe thee, death cannot celebrate thee. The liuing, the liuing he ſhall
praiſe thee.
               
               
                  Acts 17. 28. Gods glorie to be aimed at in nouriſhing our bodies. 
                  In God we liue, moue, and haue our being. Great reaſon therefore
that our life ſhould be ordered to his glorie.
               Let vs on this ground ſet this end before vs in ſuſtaining
this preſent life: and ſo order it as, when we are to depart, wee

may ſay to God,Ioh. 17. 4. as Chriſt did, I haue glorified thee on earth, &amp;c.
Whenſoeuer we pray for the things of this world, we ought to
haue this end in our minds,1. Cor. 10. 31, that whether we eate, or drinke, or whatsoeuer
we do, we may do all to the glorie of God.
               
               On this ground alſo we muſt be the more watchfull ouer our
ſelues,Life not to be miſpent. that we miſpend not our life, health, ſtrength, or goods
on any thing contrary to that end, as in perſuing carnall pleaſures,
worldly honours, earthly traſh, and ſuch like things.
Note for this purpoſe that item which the wiſe man giueth to
the young man perſiſting in miſpending his pretious time, to
whom ironically he ſaith,Eccl. 11. 9. 
                  Reioyce ô young man in thy youth, and let
thy heart cheere thee in the daies of thy youth, and walke in the wayes
of thine heart, and in the ſight of thine owne eyes. But know thou, that
for all theſe things God will bring thee to iudgement.
               
            
            
               §. 97. Of placing the Petition for temporrll bleſsings
before thoſe for ſpirituall.
               
                  Q. VVHy is this Petition for temporall bleſſings ſet before the
Petitions for ſpirituall bleſſings?
               
                  A. Many good and weightie reaſons may
be giuen of this order, which will plainly ſhew that the placing
of this Petition before the two following is no ſufficient argument,
to proue that by BREAD Chriſt is here meant. Some of
them are theſe.
               1. This is an expreſſe Petition for good, as the three former
are: but the two laſt are deprecations from euill. It was therefore
requiſite that all the good things to be craued ſhould be mentioned
before the euils againſt which we pray.
               2. The Lord by placing temporall bleſſings, whereof we are
more ſenſible, before ſpirituall, doth endeauour by degrees to
raiſe vp in vs a deſire of ſpirituall bleſſings: which though they
be more needfull,Ioh. 4. 53. are leſſe ſenſible. The Ruler whoſe ſonne
Chriſt healed, was thereby brought to beleeue in Chriſt.
               3. This Petition, being of leaſt conſequence, is moſt fitly put
in the middlemoſt place. For as matters of greateſt weight are
firſt mentioned to ſtirre vp ardencie, euen in the beginning of
prayer: ſo other things of much moment are reſerued to the

latter places to quicken the ſpirit, and to reuiue ardencie, euen
in the ending of prayer. This method do the beſt Orators vſe in
their Orations. Thus Chriſ
                     •
                   beginning this prayer with the
chiefeſt good thing of all, the glorie of Gods name, endeth it
with the beſt good things concerning men, which is his ſpirituall
good.
               4. Though temporall bleſſings be not in their kind better
then ſpirituall, yet is man more hardly brought to depend on
God for temporall, then for ſpirituall things. Witneſſe this
prouerbiall ſpeech, God take care for my ſoule, and I will take care
for my bodie. Witneſſe alſo that diſtruſtfulneſſe for outward
eſtate, which is in many Saints that ſtedfaſtly truſt in God for
pardon of ſinne, and ſufficient grace to bring them to eternall
life. In this reſpect our faith in God for things of this life, hath
a preheminence and precedence before faith in God for the
things of a better life.
               5. The things craued in the two laſt Petitions are to be obtained
in this life. In this life if pardon of ſinne, and freedome
from Satans power be not had, they can neuer be had. He that
dieth with the burden of ſinne lying on his ſoule ſhall neuer be
eaſed of it in the world to come. This life then being preſuppoſed
for obtaining pardon of ſinne, and deliuerance from euill,
it is meete that it be firſt prayed for.
            
            
               §. 98. Of riſing from temporall to ſpirituall
bleſsings.
               
                  Q. VVHat may we learne from placing, this order of placing,
temporall bleſſing before ſpirituall?
               A. By our ſeeking of ſuch things as concerne the good of our bodies,
we muſt be led on to ſeeke ſuch good things as concerne our ſoules. To
this end did Chriſt preach that excellent Sermon of the bread of
life to ſuch as followed him from place to place to haue their
bodies fed.Ioh. 6. 26. &amp;c.
               
               Thus ſhall wee make a double vſe of the temporall good
things which God beſtoweth on vs: one to refreſh our bodies:
another to ſtir vp our minds to ſeeke the things which may refreſh
our ſoules.
               
                  
Bleſſed are they which thus vſe any temporall bleſſings: and
by the ſweetneſſe of them are brought to hunger after the
bread and water of life, euen for that meate which endureth to
euerlaſting life.
            
            
               §. 99. Of ſundrie particulars compriſed vnder the
generall words of the fourth Petition.
               
                  Q. VVHat are the particular good things for which vnder the
generall words of the fourth Petition we pray?
               A. 1. Life it ſelfe. That, ſo long as it pleaſeth God, our temporall
life in this world may bee preſerued. This didPſal. 21. 4. Iſa. 38. 2. good
Kings,Pſal. 119. 175. Prophets,2. Cor. 1. 8. &amp;c. Apoſtles, and other Saints pray for, being
therein guided by the Spirit of God. For the time of this life is
Ioh. 9. 4. 
                  the day to do the worke of God: the time of death is the night
wherein no man can worke.

                  Anſw. Therein they did not as becometh Saints. That their
deſire was a fruite of the fleſh, and not of the Spirit: and therefore

                  Phil. 1. 23. 
                  Paul with a better ſpirit deſired to be diſſolued.
               
                  Anſw. That was no ſimple abſolute deſire of death, but a
thing which he could in regard of his fruition of Chriſts preſence
haue deſired, if that worke which God appointed by him
to be done, had bene finiſhed.
               2. Health and ſtrength of bodie. What doth the PſalmiſtsPſal. 88. 3. &amp;c. complaint
of weakneſſe imply, but deſire of health and ſtrength?
Yea, heVer. 2, 13. expreſly prayeth for as much. It is noted as an eſpeciall

to craue for others alſo. For the Petition is made in the plurall
number,
               
                  Q. Who are thoſe others for whom wee muſt craue temporall

                  1. Tim. 5. 8. It belongeth to vs to
prouide for them. We muſt therefore pray that we may haue
ſufficient for our ſelues, and them: and that God would further
beſtow on them whatſoeuer is requiſit for them in their places.
               2. They who are of our kindred, or alliance, though they bee
out of our Family.
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . That diſtinction which the Apoſtle maketh
betwixt theſe two phraſes, his owne, and them of his houſe, where

he requireth a prouident care for both, ſheweth that reſpect
muſt be had to our owne, that is, our kindred, though they bee
not of our Family.
               3. They which are of our towne, pariſh, or citie. That which
the Prophet aduiſeth concerning the Citie where the Iewes in
their captiuitie dwelt (which was to pray to the Lord for it,
                  Ier. 29. 7. and
to ſeeke for the proſperitie of it) may bee applyed to the Pariſh,
Towne, Village, ſtreet, or any other ſuch common place. And
this reaſon which the Prophet rendreth (in the peace thereof ſhal
you haue peace) may be extended to all ſuch places.
               4. They who are of our Nation. The Pſalmiſt ment his whole
Nation,Pſal. 122. 6. when he ſaid, Pray for the peace of Ieruſalem. And againe,
If I forget thee,
                  Pſal. 137. 5. 
                  O Ieruſalem, &amp;c.
               5. They who any where liue in this world. That all of all ſorts
may in their places be maintained, we ought to pray for a continuance
of thoſe things which at the beginning God ordained
for the preſeruation of the world: that, as God hath promiſed,Gen. 8. 22.
there may be, while the earth remaineth, ſeed-time and
harueſt, and cold and heat, and Summer and Winter, and day and
night: and all other things meet for man in this world. Yea alſo
according to publike extremities, and neceſſities muſt our
prayers be ordered, as in time of drought, for1. King. 18. 42, Iam. 5. 18. raine:1. Sam. 12. 18, 19. when
faire weather is ſeaſonable, for faire weather: in time
of2. Sam. 24. 25. Plague,Ioel 1. 14, &amp;c Famine,Exo. 17. 10, 11. Warre, or any other like diſtreſſe,
for ſuccour againſt thoſe Meſſengers of death: that
thus ſo long as God hath appointed vs to liue in this world,
we may comfortably paſſe ouer that time of life.
            
            
               §. 101. Of the things for which by vertue of
the fourth Petition we ought to
giue thankes.
               
                  Q. VVHat are the particular good things for which, by reaſon
of the fourth Petition, thanksgiuing is required?
               
                  A. 1. Life it ſelfe. For euery day that is renewed vnto vs affordeth
matter of thankes euen for that life which is lent vs.
Thus much doth the Pſalmiſt intend in theſe words. While I

liue will I praiſe the Lord,
                  Pſal. 146. 2. 
                  I will ſing praiſes vnto my God while I
haue any being.
               
               2. Health and ſtrength in that life.
                  Ioſ. 14. 10, 11. This is it which Caleb
that faithfull ſeruant of the Lord acknowledgeth, and that to
the glory of God, for he aſcribeth it to God.
               3.Deut, 8. 10. 
                  Sufficient meanes to preſerue theſe. This Moſes giueth in
expreſſe charge to Iſrael, ſaying, When thou hast eaten and filled
thy ſelfe, thou ſhalt bleſſe the Lord thy God. The Scripture
vnder one bleſſing compriſeth all bleſſings of the ſame kinde:
ſo as by virtue of that charge wee ought to bleſſe God for
apparell, ſleepe, and other meanes of maintaining health and
ſtrength.
               4,Iſa. 38, 9, &amp;c. 
                  Recouerie of health and ſtrength. For this did Hezekiah (as
a perpetuall teſtimonie of his thankefulneſſe) indight a Pſalme
of praiſe, and cauſe it to be regiſtred for all ages.
               5.Gen. 24. 26, 27. 
                  Good ſucceſſe in our paines. For this doth Abrahams ſeruant
giue expreſſe thankes vnto God.Gen. 31. 5, &amp;c. And Iaakob aſcribeth that
encreaſe which he had to God, which acknowledgement is a
thanksgiuing.
               6. The extent of Gods prouidence to our Family, and to ſuch
as we ought to prouide for. Iaakob acknowledgeth thus much,
ſaying,Gen. 33. 11, 20. 
                  God hath dealt graciouſly with mee, and I haue enough,
meaning enough for himſelfe, and all that belonged to him:
and thereupon he erected an Altar in teſtimonie of his thankefulneſſe.
               7. Gods bounty extended to the places where wee dwell. Sion
was the Citie of Dauid,
                  Pſal. 147. 12, &amp;c. and in Ieruſalem was his habitation:
he doth therefore praiſe the Lord for that peace, plenty, ſafety,
and other like bleſſings which God had beſtowed thereupon.
On this ground wee are to bleſſe God for ſuch good Gouernours
as he hath ſet ouer vs,1 Kin. 10 9. in regard of the temporall benefits
which we receiue thereby.Prou. 29. 2.
               
               8. Gods prouidence in keeping away, or remouing any euils, as
Pſal. 107. 8, 9. Famine,Pſal. 91. 2, &amp;c. Plague,Exo 15 1, &amp;c. Sword,Eſt. 9. 23, 24. Plots and practiſes of Enemies,
with the like.
               9 The common bleſſings which God beſtoweth on the whole
world. The conſideration whereof muchPſal. 8. 1, &amp;c, &amp; 145. 1, 14, 15. enlarged Dauids
heart to praiſe the Lord. Here therefore we are to take notice

how all the creatures in heauen, earth and ſea ſtill continue, as
from the beginning, to be vſefull vnto man.Pſal. 104, 2. The heauens remaine
to couer him,&amp; 136. 7, 8, 9. the Sunne, Moone and whole Hoſte of
heauen to giue him light, and to ſend him down a ſweet influence:
&amp; 139. 7. the clouds continue to water the earth,&amp; 104. 13, 14, 25, 26. the earth to feed
diuers ſorts of creatures which are for mans vſe: yea and to
nouriſh ſundry Trees, Plants, and Hearbs, and they in their
kinde to bring forth ſeuerall fruits: and the Sea to bring forth
ſundry creatures that are fit to liue therein: and the waters
that ſpring out of the earth to refreſh the creatures thereon.
All theſe, and others like to theſe, miniſter much matter of
thankſgiuing.
            
            
               §. 102. Of the duties required by vertue of the
fourth Petition.
               
                  Q. VVHat are the duties after which we ought to endeuour
by reaſon of the fourth Petition?
               
                  A.
                  Prou. 13. 4. 1. Diligence in our calling. This is that meanes which
God hath ſanctified to get bread, that is, ſuch things as are
needfull for our temporall eſtate.Gen. 2, 15.—3. 19. This was at firſt enioyned
by God to man in his innocent eſtate: and afterwards
againe in his corrupt eſtate: yea it is practiſed by vnreaſonable
creatures,Prou. 6. 6, 7, 8. who in this reſpect are ſet as a patterne before
vs.
               2. Good conſcience in getting the things that are needfull for
vs. Thus will that which we haue bee OVRS; according to
that direction of the Apoſtle to Chriſtians, that they eate their
owne bread.
                  2. Theſ. 3. 12. Thus alſo will that which wee haue bee the more
ſweet vnto vs.Prou. 15. 15. For a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt. This
is the maine thing which the Apoſtle intendeth where hee forbiddeth
Chriſtians to ſteale,
                  Epheſ. 4. 28. and enioyneth them to worke the
thing that is good.
                  Pſal. 37. 5.
               
               3.Qui diem tibi dat, etiam ea quae ad diem pertinent dat. Greg. Nyſ. de Orat. 
                  Confidence in God for his bleſſing: namely both on our
paines, and alſo on the things which wee haue gotten by our
paines,Ioh. 6. 11. being perſwaded that hee which giueth the day will
giue things needfull for the day. Chriſts giuing of thankes for

the creatures which were prouided, giueth euidence of his confidence
in Gods bleſſing.
               4. Faith in the Lord Ieſus,
                  Tit. 1. 15. for a right to what wee haue.
Thus ſhall we haue a right euen before God to that which we
haue lawfully gotten before men. And much comfort may we
reape thereby.
               5. Faithfulneſſe in nouriſhing and cheriſhing our bodies with
that which wee haue.
                  Eccl. 5. 17, 18. This is the maine end of this Petition. The
Wiſe-man pronounceth them bleſſed that eate in time for
ſtrength.
                  Eccl. 10. 17. Yea nature it ſelfe draweth man hereto. For no man
hateth his fleſh, but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it.
                  Epheſ. 5. 29.
               
               6. Temperance in vſing ſuch things as are moſt vſuall and vſefull
for vs. Thoſe are the things which are here ſtiled dayly bread.
To this purpoſe tendeth this direction of the Wiſe-man, Put
the knife to thy throat,
                  Pro. 23. 2 
                  if thou beeſt a man giuen to thine appetite.
                  Luke 21. 34.
Thus ſhall wee not be oppreſſed with ſurfetting and drunkenneſſe.
               
               7. Contentment in that which God bestoweth on vs.
                  Heb. 13. 5. This
clauſe THIS DAY importeth this duty.1. Tim. 6. 8. Much quietneſſe will
this bring vnto the mind. Till this be attained to, nothing will
ſatisfie a man: but the more he hath, the more he will couet.
               8. Prouidence for ſuch as belong to our charge. On this ground
we pray in the plurall number, Giue Vs. The Apoſtle noteth
this to be a bounden dutie, ſaying, Fathers ought to lay vp for
their children:
                  2. Cor. 12. 14. and hee layeth it ſo ſtraitly to the charge of
Chriſtians,1. Tim. 5. 8. as if they faile therein, hee accounteth them worſe
then Infidels.
               
               9. Liberalitie to ſuch as need. The extent of this particle Vs
reacheth to all of all ſorts. Now God giueth to ſome aboundance,
that out of their ſtore,2. Cor 8. 14. they ſhould miniſter to ſuch as
want. Wee therefore that pray that others may haue bread,
ought, when wee haue ſufficient for our ſelues and others,Neh. 8. 10. to
giue vnto them.
               10. Ioy in the occaſions of reioycing which others haue for Gods
bleſſing on their temporall eſtate. To that generall direction of
the Apoſtle,Rom. 12. 15. 
                  Reioyce with them that do reioyce, may this particular
be referred. We are taught to pray for others, as for our ſelues:
We muſt therefore be anſwerably affected to their good.
            
            
               
               §. 103. Of the ſinnes whereof the fourth Petition
ſheweth men to be guilty.
               
                  Q. VVHat are the ſinnes contrary to the fourth Petition,
that we ought to bewaile?
               
                  A. 1. A careleſſe neglect of our owne or others welfare.
2. A diſtruſtfull carking for the ſame.
               Q. Who may bee accounted guilty of neglecting their owne
welfare.
               
                  A. 1. They who care not what hurt they doe to their bodies.
Many bereaued of their wits, or poſſeſſed with a deuill, care
not to thruſt Pins, Kniues, Daggers, and ſuch like ſharpe inſtruments
into their fleſh, and toMar. 5. 5. 
                  ſtrike themſelues with ſtones. If
any in their right wits doe ſo, they are worſe then mad men.
               2. They who ouer-rigorouſly puniſh their bodies. Many blinded
with ſuperſtition, and beſotted with idolatry,Col. 2. 23. 
                  ſpare not their
fleſh. The1, King. 18, 28. Baalits cut themſelues with kniues and launces. Papiſts
teare their fleſh with whips, and ſundry other wayes macerate
their bodies: whereof it may be ſaid, Who required this? They
who being better inſtructed, doe, in performing ſuch duties as
are in their ſubſtance warrantable, impaire their health and
ſtrength by faſting, watching, or any other kinde of not ſparing
their bodies for duties of piety, are not free from all blame, but
come too neere to ſuperſtition: their deuotion carieth them beyond
the bounds of this Petition.
               3. They who thorow too eager a purſuit of what they like, waste
their naturall vigor, asGen. 25. 29, &amp;c 
                  Eſau, who followed his hunting till
he was faint. Fearfull was the iſſue which thereupon followed:
for it coſt him his birth-right. All immoderate paines of minde
or body, are aberrations ſweruing from this Petition, whether
they be of Porters, Labourers, Husbandmen, Tradeſmen, Seafaring
men, Students, or any others.
               4. They who by immoderate paſſion ſhorten their dayes. It is
taxed, as a fault inIer. 31. 15. 
                  Rachel, that ſhe refuſed to be comforted: from
which faultGen. 37. 35. 
                  Iaakob was not altogether free. If by intemperancy
in eating, drinking, or any other way men bring diſeaſes
vpon their bodies, or haſten their death, their ſinne is much
more hainous.
               
                  
5. They who thorow niggardlineſſe afford not themſelues things
needfull. This is one of the great vanities which the Wiſe-man
taxeth, thatEccl. 6. 2. 
                  a man to whom God hath giuen riches, wealth, and
honour,
                  Pecuniae non dominus ſed ſervus eſt: cuſtos, non poſſeſſor. Bern. ſuper Cant. Ser▪ 21. 
                  ſo as he wanteth nothing for his ſoule of all that he deſireth,
yet God giueth him not power to eate thereof. Such an one is a ſeruant,
not a Maſter; a keeper, not an owner of his wealth.
               6. They who caſt themſelues into needleſſe dangers.
                  2. Sam. 23. 16, 17. After Dauid
had beene a meanes of mouing three of his Worthies to
hazard their liues to ſatisfie his longing, his heart ſmote
him for it.2. Sam. 2. 14, 15 How fearfull was the iſſue of thoſe twelue couples
of yong men whom Abner and Ioab ſent to play a dangerous
ſport? On this ground quarrellers, challengers, vndertakers
of ſingle combates, eſpecially on priuate occaſions, but moſt of
all where the combates are deſperate, as with Piſtols, or double
Rapiers, their bodies being naked, are condemned.
               7. Selfe-murtherers. It is the maine ſcope of this Petition to
deſire preſeruation of life. How contrary thereunto is it to
take away a mans owne life? They were deſperate reprobates
that in Scripture are noted to haue done ſo: as1 Sam. 31. 4. 
                  Saul,
                  2. Sam. 17. 23. 
                  Achitophel,
andMath. 27. 5. 
                  Iudas. As forIudg. 16. 30. 
                  Sampſon, the thing that he aimed at
was to deſtroy the enemies of the Church, not himſelfe: and
what he did, he did by an extraordinarie Spirit: and therein he
was a type of Chriſt, who by his owne death deſtroyed the
enemies of the Church.
            
            
               §. 114. Of neglecting the welfare of others.
               Q. VVHo may be accounted guilty of neglecting the welfare
of others?
               
                  A. 1. They who are improuident for ſuch as
are vnder their charge: as improuident Husbands, Parents,
Maſters, and other Gouernours.Math. 7. 11. Such as are euill, can giue
good things to their children; what may then be thought of them
that doe it not?
               2. They who are vnmercifull to others that need,Iam. 2 13. Saint
Iames denounceth iudgement mercileſſe againſt ſuch. A fearefull
doome. For mercy is the onely ground of that hope,
which ſinners can haue.
               
                  
3. They who enuie at the proſperitie and aboundance of
others: as theGen. 26. 14.—30. 1. 
                  Philiſtims enuied Iſaak: and Rachel enuied
her ſiſter. Well ſaith the Wiſe-man hereof, that it is the
rottenneſſe of the bones, Prou. 14. 30.
            
            
               §. 104. Of ſundry branches of improuidence.
               
                  Q. HOw is the forenamed improuidence manifeſted?
               
                  A. 1. By idleneſſe, and negligence in a mans calling,
whereby he depriueth himſelfe of the meanes wherewith
hee ſhould prouide for himſelfe, and his charge.Pro. 24. 30, 31. 
                  The field
and vineyard of the ſlouthfull bringeth forth thornes and nettles,
in ſtead of Wheat and Grapes.
               2. By medling too much with other mens matters. Such
an one isPro. 26. 17. 
                  as one that taketh a dogge by the eares: hee may get
a ſnap thereby. Therefore Saint Peter wiſely exhorteth Chriſtians
1. Pet. 4. 15. not to ſuffer as buſie-bodies: a man can haue no more
comfort in ſuch ſufferings, then in ſuffering for theft, murder,
and ſuch crimes.
               3. By following paſtimes too much. ForProu. 21. 17. 
                  hee that loueth
paſtime ſhall be a poore man. Much time and money vſeth to be
ſpent by ſuch. Faire inheritances haue beene caſt away at Dice.
               4. By frequenting lewd companie. For
                  Prou. 6. 26. by meanes of a
whoriſh woman, a man is brought to a peece of bread: and
                  —23. 21. The
drunkard and the glutton ſhall come to pouertie.
               5. By prodigalitie.Luke 15. 13. 
                  The Prodigall child waſted his ſubſtance
with riotous liuing.
            
            
               §. 105. Of carking too much for this world.
               
                  Q. VVHo carke too much for their temporall eſtate?
               
                  A. 1. Profane Worldlings that preferre the
things of this world before the glory of God. They would
haue the fourth Petition to bee firſt. Such were the Iewes
that madeHag. 1, 4. 
                  ſeeled houſes for themſelues, while the houſe of
God lay waſte: and theMath. 8. 34. Gadarens that preferred their ſwine
before Chriſt.
               2. Couetous men, whoſe deſire is neuer ſatisfied: they are
like the things that can neuer ſay,Pro. 30. 15, 16. 
                  It is enough. They who

are couetouſly minded, regard not the limitation of this Petition,
by THIS DAY. Their mind is more on yeares then dayes:
as his was that ſaid to his ſoule,Luke 12. 19. 
                  Thou haſt much goods laid vp
for many yeares.
               
               3. Vnconſcionable perſons, who care not how they get what
they haue. They haue no reſpect to this particle of right, OVR.
Vnder this head1. King. 21. 8. Iam. 5. 4. all the violent oppreſſions, and fraudulent
circumuentions which any vſe, may be compriſed.
               4.Tit. 1. 15. Vnbeleeuers, who before God can call nothing their
owne.
               
               5. Vngratefull wretches, that haue neither mind nor time
to giue God thankes for the good things they haue: like to
theLuk. 17. 17, 18. nine Lepers, who being clenſed, neuer returned to giue
thankes to Chriſt. Do theſe account their Father in heauen to
be the giuer of the things on earth?
            
         
         
            
            THE FIFTH
PETITION.
            
               §. 106. Of ſinnes ſtiled debts, and of the kinds of
thoſe debts.
               
                  Q. WHich is the fifth Petition?

which by Mathew is called debts, by Luke is called ſinnes. And

               Q. In what reſpect are we ſinners counted Debters?

               Thus there is a double bond whereby wee ſtand bound as
debters to God.Man a debter to God by a double bond.
               
               One is the bond of the Law, whereunto we are tied in a double
reſpect.
               1. In regard of the ſupreme ſoueraignty, and abſolute authoritie
which God hath ouer vs. This is expreſſed in the Preface
before the Decalogue thus, I am the Lord thy God.
               
               2. In regard of the many benefits which wee haue all our
daies receiued, and ſtill do continue to receiue from him. By
God we are what we are: and haue what we haue: He created
vs, He preſerueth vs, He prouideth for vs all needfull things,
He protecteth vs from all hurtfull things. This alſo is intimated
in the fore-ſaid Preface by mention of one great benefit, Freedome
from Egypt, the houſe of bondage.
               
               The other bond is the curſe of the Law, whereunto we are
tied by forfeiture of the former.Deut. 27. 26. For he that performeth not the
condition of a bond, ſtandeth liable to the penaltie of the
bond. In regard whereof the Law is called

                  Adam, euen in his innocencie, and all we that come from him,
are in the former reſpect debters by vertue of our creation. Adam
ſince his fall, and all his wicked off-ſpring are in the latter
reſpect debters by reaſon of our tranſgreſſions.
               Q. Which of thoſe debts do we here deſire to be forgiuen?
               
                  A. The latter moſt eſpecially, whereby wee are bound to
theGal. 3. 10. curſe of the Law, which is the penalty of it. This penalty▪
if it were exacted, would make vs moſt miſerable. There is good
cauſe therefore of praying to haue that remitted. As for the other
debt of obedience, we ought to deſire rather abilitie to performe
it, then libertie to be freed from it. Yet notwithſtanding,

becauſe it is impoſſible for vs, ſo long as fleſh is in vs, to pay
that debt, as it ought to be paid, by conſequence we deſire a remiſſion
of that debt; namely, that God would not exact of vs
to be performed by vs in our owne perſons ſuch exact and compleate
obedience as the Law requireth.
            
            
               §. 107. Of Chriſts actiue righteouſneſſe
imputed to vs.
               
                  Q. IN regard of our diſabilitie to diſcharge our debt of obedience to
God, what may be inferred?
               A. Imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe is neceſſary for
our inſtification. Chriſt teacheth vs to deſire a diſcharge of all
debts. The Law requireth a debt of perfect righteouſneſſe. This
we are not able to pay of our ſelues. But our Suretie being able,
did pay it.Mat 3. 15. He fulfilled all righteouſneſſe. By the imputation
thereof to vs, are we diſcharged.Rom. 5. 18, 19 
                  For as by one mans diſobed ence
many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one ſhall many be made
righteous. His righteouſneſſe is vpon vs to iuſtification of life. In this
reſpect Chriſt is ſaid to be1. Cor. 1. 30. 
                  made vnto vs righteouſneſſe: and we
are ſaid to be2. Cor. 5. 21. 
                  made the righteouſneſſe: of God in him. This kind of
debt is not duly conſidered of them,Arg. againſt Chriſt actiue right. anſw. who exclude the actiue
obedience of Chriſt from our iuſtification. They preſſe thoſe
places which make mention onely of the bloud of Chriſt, forgetting
the Synecdoche which is frequent in the Scripture,
whereby one member or part is put for all of that kind. In particular
they preſſe this Petition, which placeth our iuſtification
in remiſſion of ſinnes, not conceiuing that vnder debts here
mentioned, all manner of debts are compriſed: and vnder this
word forgiue, all manner of needfull diſcharge. Where further
they ſay, that Chriſts actiue righteouſneſſe: was neceſſarie for
himſelfe, they do not duely conſider the dignitie of his perſon
by vertue of the hypoſtaticall vnion of his two natures: which
dignitie exempteth him from all neceſſitie of obedience to the
Law, in regard of himſelfe.
               This doctrine of the imputation,Comfort. euen of the Actiue obedience

of Chriſt,Iſa. 64. 6. bringeth much comfort to poore ſinners, who
knowing that all their righteouſneſſes are as filthy rags, do thereupon
tremble at the thought of the preſence of the righteous
Lord. But their faith in Chriſt his righteouſneſſe imputed to
them (in ſtead of that debt of righteouſneſſe which they owed
to God) whereby they are accounted righteous before God,
maketh them with much comfort and great confidence preſent
themſelues before him.

But in this world many haue their ſinnes forgiuen.
               
                  Anſw. Remiſſion taketh away the guilt of ſinne, but not the
roote of ſinne. The law of ſinne is remitted in ſpirituall regeneration,
and yet it remaineth in mortall fleſh: otherwiſe ſinne
could not be propagated in the regenerate,Iuſtificatis d

of our aduerſaries,Preſumptuous poſitions of Papiſts. which are theſe that follow and ſuch

that by Baptiſme all ſins are in very deed taken away, ſo as not
onely it is not imputed,

                  but there is not that which maybe imputed for
fault or blame. Do they not hereby ſhew that the truth is not in
them? For1. Ioh. 1. 8. 
                  if we ſay that we haue no ſinne, we deceiue our ſelues, and
the truth is not in vs?
               
               2. That concupiſcence which is in the regenerate, is not truly and
properly ſinne. Anſw. What is this, but to hold that the ſpring of
ſinne is cleane dried vp in the regenerate?Concil. Trid. ibid. Bellar▪ de Amiſſ grat. l. 5. c. 7. If the ſpring be drie,
whence ſhall any ſtreames of ſinne proceed?

If then they do what they are able, what need they aske remiſſion

               4. The workes of iuſt men are perfect. Anſw. Perfection needs
no remiſſion. For ſuch workes then by their doctrine they need
aske no pardon. O preſumptuous and arrogant conceipts!

                  ſtation of our

out with Saint Paul,

               And that thoſe out-cries may appeare to be effects of true humiliation,Seeke pardon for ſinne,
rather then of deſperation, we ought earneſtly and inſtantly
to ſeeke remiſſion of ſinne, which is the maine matter
intended in this Petition: well weighing for the point in hand,
that1. Tim. 1. 15. 
                  This is a faithfull ſaying, worthy of all acceptation, that Chriſt
Ieſus came into the world to ſaue ſinners.
               
            
            
               
               §. 109. Of falling into ſinne daily.
               
                  Q. VVHat obſeruation doth our daily praying for forgiueneſſe
of ſinne afford?Docetur peccare ſe quotidiè, dum quotidiè pro peccatis iubetur o rare. Cypr. de Orat. Dom §. 16. For the word, this day, expreſſed in the
fourth Petition, is to be vnderſtood in euery Petition.
               
                  A. Euery day men fall into ſinne. The Metaphor ofIob 15. 16. 
                  drinking iniquitie
like water, importeth as much: for it ſheweth that it is as
ordinarie and familiar for a man to ſinne as to drinke, which he
doth oft euery day. Dares any man denie the truth of this doctrine
vpon his experience? If he dare, ſurely his conſcience is as
ſeared with an hot iron, or elſe he lyeth againſt his conſcience.
For the forenamed originall corruption as it remaineth in vs,
ſo it remaineth as a ſpring in vs, continually ſending forth ſome
ſalt and bitter water of ſinne, more or leſſe.
               Many excellent directions may fitly be inferred from this obſeruation.Duties for redreſſing the ſin whereinto we daily fall. As
               1. To ſet apart ſome time euery day for examination of our
ſelues: that ſo we may the better obſerue thoſe ſeuerall ſinnes
which euery day paſſe from vs. If they be not obſerued, they
may lie ſo long feſtering the ſoule, as thereby proue incurable.
               2. To humble our ſoules daily before God. Euery day is the
fire of Gods iealouſie kindled by our daily ſinnes, whereby he
is prouoked to come out in wrath, and to take reuenge. Euery
day therefore muſt we fall downe before him with broken ſpirits
and humbled ſoules. This is a meanes to turne his furie to
pittie.
               3. To renue our couenant with God euery day. For euery ſin
maketh forfeiture of the couenant. The couenant being forfeited,
with what comfort can wee apply it to our ſelues? with
what confidence can we plead it before God?
               4. To repent daily.Luke 17. 4. Repentance is a prouiſo annexed to a
mans forgiuing his brother.Quia nullus eſt dies in quo 
                        〈◊〉
                      poſſit eſſe ſi
                        •
                     e peccato, vna die eſſe non debet ſi ne paenitentia. Aug. in Apoc. Hom. 2. Much more doth God expect it of
ſuch as expect forgiueneſſe of him. He that ſinneth ſeuen times
in a day, muſt repent ſeuen times in a day. As ſinne incenſeth
wrath, ſo repentance for ſin maketh God to repent his wrath.
Becauſe therefore there is no day wherein a man is without ſin,
he ought not to be one day without repentance.
               
                  
5. To meditate euery day as on the ſatisfaction which the Lord
Ieſus once made vpon the croſſe for our ſinnes, ſo on the interceſſion
which he continueth daily to make at the throne of
Grace.Rom. 8. 34. This giueth good ground of aſſured hope of continuall
pardon for our continuall ſinnes. For the maine end of Chriſts
continuall interceſſion is to make continuall application of his
all-ſufficient ſacrifice to our continuall ſinnes.
               6. To pray euery day for pardon. This we are here expreſly
taught to do. All the forenamed points are but preparations
vnto this. This, if it be performed in faith, is it that obtaineth
pardon ſo oft as we ſinne. The daily offerings which euery morning
and euening were appointed vnder the Law,Exo. 29. 38, 39. prefigured
thus much.
               7. To watch continually. The more ſubiect and prone wee
are to fall into ſinne, the more needfull it is, that with all heedfulneſſe
we watch againſt ſinne. Satans ſedulitie, the deceitfulneſſe
of ſinne, and our owne fooliſhneſſe require diligent and
conſtant watchfulneſſe.
            
            
               §. 110. Of the difference betwixt Gods abſolution,
and mans apprehenſion thereof.
               Ob. GOds forgiueneſſe is full, compleate, and abſolute. Whom
once he acquitteth, he neuer calleth to accompt againe. His
diſcharge is of ſinnes paſt, preſent, and to come. What
need then of thoſe daily duties?
               
                  Anſw.
                  That which on Gods part is at once fully done, is on our part by degrees apprehended and applyed. I grant it to be ſo in the eternall decree and ſecret
counſell: yea and in that couenant which is made betwixt him
and his Sonne, our Suretie. But in the application thereof to
vs, and in our apprehenſion of it by faith, (whereby onely our
ſoule can reſt quieted, and aſſured of it) a proceeding by degrees
muſt be acknowledged. Though a beleeuer do for the preſent
apprehend a full diſcharge of all the ſinnes whereof he doth then
ſtand guiltie, yet through the violence of temptation, and the
weakeneſſe of fleſh, he may againe and againe make queſtion
and doubt of that diſcharge, eſpecially when he hath fallen into
other ſinnes, or returned to the ſame ſinnes for which he before
craued pardon. Oft ſinning doth much ſhake and weaken faith.

Chriſt ſaw it needfull to giue to the woman, whom hee himſelfe
abſolued,Ioh. 8. 11. this caueat, Sinne no more. Wherefore for
ſtrengthening our weake faith in a full pardon of all our ſinnes,
for new ſetling of it when it is ſhaken, for healing the wounds

               §. 111. Of Popiſh indulgences for ſinnes to come,
and Shriuing in Lent.
               COntrarie to this branch of this Petition are the blaſphemous
Indulgences which by Popes and popiſh Prieſts are
giuen for ſinnes to come,See §. 126. and that not onely for ſome particular
ſinnes,Vid. Hadrian. in tract. de Indulg. Nauar. de. Iubil. Cornubenſ. de Indulg. Ioh. de Turrecr. in Comment. de Poen. Bell. de Indulg. whereby they eag on, and embolden men to commit
thoſe ſinnes, but alſo for all manner of ſinnes, not for a day, or
a weeke, or a moneth, or a yeare, but for many yeares, yea all
their life. And leſt they ſhould feare vengeance and puniſhment
for their ſinnes after this life in Purgatory (with which fiction
they much affright their people) they extend their indulgences
farre beyond the times which they themſelues doe ſet for
Purgatorie, euen vntoIndulgentiae interdum continent condonationem poenitentiae quindecim, vel viginti millium annorum. Bellar. de Iudulg. l. 1. c. 9. Auditum ſub coelo non legitur quod corum voce depromitur, Date nobis veniam, dum tamen nos in errore manemus. Gelaſ. Epiſt. ad Fauſt. Concil. Trid. §. 14 c. 5. 6, 7. 8. fifteene and twenty thouſand yeares.
Are not flood-gates hereby wide opened to all manner of licentiouſneſſe?
are not men hereby made not onely ſecure, but
alſo impudent in committing ſinne? By thoſe indulgences
men are taught to ſay, Grant vs pardon, euen while we commit
ſinne. Was euer the like heard?
               To the like licentious libertie doth their ſuperſtitious cuſtome
of Auricular confeſſion, and of abſolution thereunto
giuen by a Prieſt once a yeere in Lent, bring men. Yet this is
not onely by ordinarie cuſtome practiſed, but by their great
Councell at Trent warranted.
            
            
               
               §. 112. Of neglecting to ſeeke diſcharge of ſinne
till Eaſter: or till a day of viſitation,
or death
               VVHat now ſhall wee ſay of ſuch among vs as put off all
ſerious and thorow examination of themſelnes, confeſſion
of their ſinnes, and renewing of repentance of Eaſter,
when they intend to receiue the holy Communion? Though
they forbeare the ſuperſtitious practiſe of Auricular confeſſion,
yet they make as wide a gap for licentiouſneſſe, and wickedneſſe
as Papiſts doe. For ſuch commonly make little o
                     •
                   no
conſcience of any ſinne till about Eaſter time. And is there not
iuſt cauſe to thinke that that ſhew of conſcience which they
then make, is but a meere ſhew? and that it ſauoureth more of
fond ſuperſtition, then of ſound Religion? Can it be imaginned
that ſuch as all the yeare long let looſe the raines to impietie,
and iniquitie, can once in the yeare make a thorow examination
of their ſoules, and confeſſion of their ſinnes? Neither
will they haue any minde to diue to the depth of ſuch a ſea:
neither if they had a will thereto, could they poſſibly doe it.
Such mens ſoules muſt needs feſter for want of timely and due
ſearch thereinto.
               Much more deſperate muſt there caſe needs be,The danger of putting oft exa mination, and repentance too long. who are ſo
farre from a dayly, yea and yearely ſearching of themſelues,
and ſeeking to be diſcharged of their ſinnes, as all their life
long they neuer thinke of any ſuch matter, vnleſſe God by
ſome extraordinarie iudgement bring them, as hee brought
Pharaoh,
                  Exod. 10. 16. generally and confuſedly to acknowledge that they
haue ſinned: or vnleſſe they obſerue death to haue ſeaſed vpon
them: at which time if their ſinnes bee laid before them, either
their heart is like,1. Sam. 25. 37. as Nabals, to die in them, and to become
ſenceleſſe as a ſtone: or elſe their conſcience to be, as
Iudas his conſcience was,Math. 27. 5. was, a racke, or rather an hell vnto them,
vncapable of comfort. For at the time of death the bodie is
weake, the heart faint, the ſpirits dull: yea to him that hath
not before made his peace with God, the thought of death
can not be but very terrible, a meanes euen to aſtoniſh him

that is otherwiſe feeble, dull and heauy. Satan, that is not ignorant
hereof, taketh great aduantage there at: and is then moſt
buſie to tempt, and moſt fierce and forward to aſſault▪ when
man is leaſt able to reſiſt. And whereas all our hope of ſtanding
againſt Satan is in Gods helpe: ſuch as haue all their
life long prouoked Gods wrath, and vſed no meanes to be
reconciled to him, can haue little hope in the laſt act to receiue
helpe from him.
            
            
               §. 113. Of the wofulneſſe of the debt of ſinne.
               
                  Q. WHat doctrine doth the reſemblance of ſinne to debt,
imply?
               
                  A.
                  Sinners debters to God iuſtice. 
                  Sinne maketh man bound to the reuenging iuſtice of God.
He that thus prayed to God,Pſal. 143. 2. 
                  Enter not into iudgement with thy
ſeruant, well knew as much.
               Euery ſinne is a breach of Couenant betwixt God and man.
It maketh forfeiture thereof. As a debter therefore that hath
made forfeiture of his bond, ſtands liable to the reuenge of the
Creditor: or rather, as a malefactor that hath tranſgreſſed the
Law of his Soueraigne, is liable to the penaltie of the Law: ſo
a ſinner to the iuſt reuenge of Gods Law.
               Take notice hereby of the horrible nature of ſinne.Horribleneſſe of ſinne. It
kindleth the wrath, it prouoketh the reuenge of the Creator.
Who knoweth the power of his anger?
                  Pſal. 90. 11. As his greatneſſe is, ſo is
his anger: Infinite, inſupportable. Hence is it that the creature
on whom it lyeth, lyeth vnder it eternally. For hee is no
way able to eaſe himſelfe of that burden. If this were duely
weighed, and ſeriouſly thought of when we are tempted to any
ſinne, would we be ſo fooliſh, as for a little momentany delight
to runne into ſuch a debt as will caſt vs into that priſon,
out of which there is no releaſe, and in which there is torture
and torment, endleſſe and eaſeleſſe. We count them miſerable
that fall ſo farre into mans debt, as they are neuer able to diſcharge
it. What may we then thinke of ſuch as fall into this
debt of ſinne?
               Take alſo hereby further notice of the neceſſitie of ſuch a
Surety as Ieſus Chriſt is,Neceſſitie of Chriſts Suretiſhip. God-Man in one perſon. For ſuch

is the debt of ſinne, as no creature in heauen or in earth was
able to diſcharge it. If Chriſt had not vndertaken the diſcharge
thereof, our caſe had been like to the caſe of thoſe Angels, who
are reſerued in euerlasting chaines vnder darkneſſe,
                  Iude, verſe 6. 
                  vnto the iudgement
of the great Day.
               
            
            
               §. 114. Of euery ſinne being mortall, yet
not equall.
               Q. WHat doth the penaltie whereby ſinne is made a debt,
import?
               
                  A. Sinne is mortall. Yea becauſe this Metaphor, Debts,
being of the plurall number, is indefinitely vſed, and compriſeth
all manner of ſinnes vnder it, I may further inferre,
that
               
                  Euery ſinne is mortall. For that penalty which is due to theſe
debts, is death. InſtanceGen. 2. 17. the firſt ſinne that was committed.
And to ſhew that the like holdeth in euery ſinner, the Prophet
without any limitation, reſeruation, or exception at all,
ſaith,Ezek. 18. 4. 
                  The ſoule that ſinneth it ſhall dye. If it be a ſinne, in that it
is ſinne, deadly it must needs be, bee it great or ſmall; in
thought, word, or deed. ForRom. 6. 23. 
                  the wages of ſinne, (euen of whatſoeuer
is ſinne) is death. Being a ſinne, it is a tranſgreſſion of
the Law. For theſe two words, ſinne, tranſgreſſion, are conuertible,
and reciprocall termes: one importeth as much as the
other.
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  Sinne is a tranſgreſſion.
                  1. Ioh. 3. 4. And,
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  All vnrighteouſneſſ (or
euery tranſgreſſion) is ſinne. But euery tranſgreſſion is deadly.
For,Gal. 3. 10. 
                  Curſed is euery one that continueth not in all things that
are written in the Law. And all vnrighteouſneſſe is deadly. For
Rom. 1. 18. 
                  the wrath of God is reuealed againſt all vnrighteouſneſſe. And
that not without iuſt cauſe. For all vnrighteouſneſſe, euery
tranſgreſſion, euery ſinne is againſt the good will of God who
is of infinite excellency and Maieſtie,See my Treatiſe of the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt. §. 31. and in that reſpect it is
of an infinite praultie, and deſerueth an infinite puniſhment,
eternall death.
               
                  Obiect. Thus all ſinnes are made equall.
               
                  A. Nothing leſſe. For neither doth the ſame kinde of puniſhment
make all the crimes, for which it is inflicted, equall;

nor doth the ſame kinde preſuppoſe the ſame meaſure of puniſhment.
Robbers and murtherers are put to the ſame kinde
of death: yet is murther a more hainous ſinne then robberie.
Beſides among ſuch Malefactors as are put to death, the kinde
of death whereunto ſome are put, is much more terrible, then
that whereunto others are put. Will any thence inferre, that
all crimes which are capitall, are equall? Much more abſurd is
the inference of Papiſts, that all ſinnes are made equall, becauſe
all are made mortall. They themſelues doe not hold all
the ſinnes which they iudge mortall,Mat. 11. 22, 24. to bee equall. There are
degrees of torment in hell. Though all ſuch in their nature
and kinde (if they be not forgiuen) implunge men into death
and damnation, yet not into the ſame degree of torture.
            
            
               §. 115. Of the diſtinction of Veniall and
mortall ſinnes.
               Q. ARe then no ſinnes at all Veniall?
               
                  A. The diſtinction of Veniall and mortall ſinnes
rightly and wiſely limited, may ſafely be admitted,
and that in foure reſpects eſpecially.
               1. In regard of the order that God hath by his Word reuealed.
               2. In regard of the ſubiect or perſon in whom ſinne is.
               3. In compariſon of one ſinne with another.
               4. In regard of the Churches manner of proceeding againſt
ſinners.
               1. Concerning the order which by Gods Word is reuealed,
there is an irreuocable Decree paſſed vpon the ſinne againſt the
Holy Ghoſt,
                  Math. 12. 31. that it ſhall neuer be forgiuen.
                  Heb. 6. 4. &amp;c.—10, 26, &amp;c. Howſoeuer the ſecret
Decree of God bee as inuiolable againſt all the ſinnes of
euery Reprobate, yet becauſe that determined doome is not
reuealed againſt any one ſinne but that, of It onely it is ſaid,
There is a ſinne vnto death.
                  1. Ioh. 5. 16. The ſinne therefore againſt the Holy
Ghoſt is mortall. But in oppoſition to it, Chriſt ſaith, All ſinnes
ſhall be forgiuen:
                  Mar. 3. 28. that is, they are remiſſible, pardonable, and
in the reſpect veniall.
               
               2. Concerning the ſubiect, or perſon in whom ſinne is, after

that by faith the Elect are ingraffed into Chriſt, though ſinne
remaine in them, yet is it not imputed to them for condemnation.
There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Ieſus.
                  Rom 8. 1.
All the ſinnes therefore of true Beleeuers are veniall. They ſhall
be pardoned; but all the ſinnes of vnbeleeuers are mortall: they
ſhall be puniſhed with euerlaſting damnation.Ioh. 3. 36. 
                  The wrath of
God abideth on him that beleeueth not.
                  Quaedam peccata mortalia in poenitentia fiunt venialia. Mag. Sentent, lib. 4. diſt. 20. Beſides, the true Beleeuer,
though he may fall into many ſinnes, will impenitently lye
in no ſinne. So as ſuch ſins as in another would incurre death,
and proue mortall, in him by repentance become veniall, and
are pardoned.
               3. Concerning compariſon of ſinnes, it cannot bee denied
that ſome ſinnes are very ſmall, as a by-thought in an holy
duty, an idle word, a little tap with the hand; and that other
ſinnes are very hainous, as blaſphemie, periurie, murther, adulterie
and ſuch like. Therefore comparatiuely ſmaller ſinnes
may bee ſtiled veniall, in relation to hainous and notorious
ſinnes, which are called mortall, in that they doe more apparantly
and more deepely implunge into death and damnation.
Thus all Eccleſiaſtical Writers, both ancient and moderne, haue
vſed this diſtinction.
               4. Concerning the Churches manner of proceeding againſt
ſinners, many ſinnes doe dayly paſſe from men, which▪ though
by Miniſters they be reproued, and Gods iudgements be denounced
againſt them, yet paſſe not vnder the Churches publike
cenſure. Theſe haue been called veniall. There are other
ſinnes which euen before men ſeeme ſo intollerable, as the
Church thinketh not the committers of them worthy to bee
admitted to the holy ordinances of God, but denounceth againſt
them ſome publike cenſure of ſuſpention, excommunication,
or execration and anathema, till publike repentance be
manifeſted, and ſatisfaction giuen to the Church. Thus becauſe
one of the Church of Corinth had committed ſuch fornication
as is not ſo much as named among the Gentiles,
                  1. Cor. 5. 1▪ 5. 
                  Saint Paul
deliuered him to Satan. Theſe ſinnes worthy of ſuch cenſure,
haue been called mortall.
               
               But as our Aduerſaries vſe the diſtinction of veniall and
mortall ſinne,Sinne not veni all in its owne nature. it cannot ſtand with the forenamed nature of

ſinne, implyed vnder this Metaphor Debt. They ſay that many
ſinnes areRhem. annot. on Rom. 1. 32. 
                  veniall, becauſe they are pardonable of their owne
nature, and not worthy of damnation. They giue theſe and ſuch
like inſtances of veniall ſinnes: Sudden motions of luſt,
                  B
                        •
                     llar. de Stat. pecl. 1. cap. 3. 
                  anger,
and enuie: Immoderate laughter, an idle word, deceit in a ſmall
thing, as an halfe-peny, &amp;c. Their great Champian doth thus expreſſe
the meaning of their Church in this point:Veniale peccalum ex natura ſua diſtinguiturà mortali, ac ſinc vlla relatione vel ad Praedeſtinationem, vel ad miſcricordiom Dei, vel ad ſtatum ren
                        •
                     lorum, eſt eiuſmodi, vt poenam aeternam non mereatur. Bellar. de Stat. pec. lib. 1. càp. 9. 
                  Veniall ſinne
is in its owne nature diſtinguiſhed from mortall, and without any
reſpect to predeſtination, or to the mercy of God, or to the ſtate
of the regenerate, it is of that kinde, as it deſerueth not eternall
puniſhment. He inſerteth theſe phraſes (without reſpect to Predeſtination,
or to the mercy of God, or to the ſtate of the regenerate)
becauſe orthodoxall Diuines haue granted that the title
veniall, may be applied to ſinne in regard of Gods eternall predeſtination,
and purpoſe to pardon ſinne, and in regard of the
mercy of God, which is greater then the deſert of ſinne, and
in regard of the regenerate, whoſe faith gaineth an abſolution
for ſinne. To ſhew therefore, that hee and his hereticall
Church, whoſe cauſe hee maintaineth, goeth beyond the limits
of all truth, hee reiecteth the fore-named limitations
wherein truth is bounded: and will haue ventall ſinnes to be
of themſelues in their owne nature not worthy of damnation.
In their ſence, theſe two termes, Sinne, Veniall, are contradictorie,
Sinne is (according to the doctrine of the Scripture)
worthy of damnation. V
                        •
                     niall (according to their sence) is not
worthy fo damnation.
                  Rom. 6. 23. To ſay therefore that ſinne is veniall, is
to ſay that worthy of damnation, is not worthy of damnation. But
I demand, are their veniall ſins pleaſing or diſpleaſing to God?
one of them they muſt be. A meane cannot bee giuen betwixt
theſe two contradictorie termes, which is neither of them. They
dare not ſay that veniall ſinnes are pleaſing to God. Then doe
they diſpleaſe him. If they diſpleaſe him they offend an infinite
goodneſſe, an infinite excellency, an infinite Maieſtie, and in
that reſpect are worthy of an infinite puniſhment.
               As for their owne inſtances of veniall ſinnes:
               1. The ſuddenneſt motions that can be, though no conſent
ſhould be yeelded to them, are againſt the firſt and laſt commandements.
Beſides, the perfect Law of God is ſpirituall. It

requireth integritie in the innermoſt parts, euen in the ſpirits
of men The fore-mentioned thoughts are againſt ſpirituall integritie:
and in that reſpect againſt the Law: and deſerue the
curſe thereof. Yea further the ſecreteſt &amp; ſuddenneſt thoughts,
are acts and motions of the ſoule: as manifeſt to God as outward
actions of the body. If therefore they be euill, they are in
his ſight apparant tranſgreſſions. As for motions to luſt, though
neuer ſo ſudden at the very ſight of a woman,Math. 5. 22, 28. Chriſt accounteth
them a kinde of adulterie. And motions to anger hee accounteth
a kinde of murther. But Adulterie and Murther are
againſt the Law, and deſerue the curſe of the Law.
               2. Of idle words, Chriſt ſaith,Math. 12. 36. 
                  Men ſhall giue account at the
Day of Iudgement. When the account is taken, ſhall idle words
at the barre of that Iudgement be approued, or condemned?
To ſay they ſhall be approued, were much to impeach the perfection
of Chriſts purity and iuſtice If then they be condemned,
eternall death is their due. There is then no other penalty to be
inflicted. All ſtanding at that Barre, are pronounced bleſſed, or
denounced curſed.
               
               3. For ſtealth of an halfe-penny, doth the Law which ſaith,
Thou ſhalt not ſteale, exclude halfe-pennies or no? If no, where is
the exception. The words are indefinite, Thou ſhalt not ſteale.
He that ſtealeth an halfe-penny, ſtealeth. In ſtealing an halfepeny
therefore he is a tranſgreſſor of the Law, and guilty of the
penalty and curſe thereof.
               To conclude, God ſhall bring euery worke into iudgement,
                  Eccl. 12. 14. 
                  with
euery ſecret thing whether it be good or euill. The ſmalleſt things
that can bee imagined are compriſed vnder theſe phraſes euery

                        •
                     orke, euery ſecret thing. If they be brought to iudgement, it is
either to be rewarded, or reuenged. If they be good, to be rewarded.
For a cup of cold water onely giuen to a Diſciple in the
name of a Diſciple ſhall in no wiſe loſe his reward.
                  Math. 10. 42. But if they bee
euill, to be reuenged. If at the Day of Iudgement they be reuenged,
ſurely the reuenge is eternall death. But veniall ſins are euil,
not good. They ſhall therefore be brought into iudgement, condemned,
&amp; puniſhed with eternall death. I ſpeake of ſinnes not
repented of: not waſhed away by the bloud of Chriſt: of ſinnes
as they are in their own nature, in their own deſert. For ſo ſtandeth
the controuerſie betwixt vs and Papiſts.

                  by the Law is the knowledge of ſinne.) And knowing ſinne,
carefully and conſcionably to auoide it: (ForRom. 6. 23. 
                  the wages of ſinne

                  4. Repent.) And no way make our ſelues acceſſarie to the ſinnes

               §. 117. Of the many debts wherein we ſtand bound
to Gods iuſtice.
               
                  Q. WHy are debts ſet downe ſo indefinitely in the plurall
number?
               A.Iam. 2. 3. 
                  Our debts are many. Our ſinnes are of ſundry
ſorts:Amos 5. 12. and of euery ſort there are many in number. Firſt originall
corruption, which is the ſeed and ſpawne of all ſinnes, is
a debt.

God at firſt created vs, and which Gods Law, that is ſpirituall,

thoſe ſinnes and debts whereof he deſireth to be diſcharged.
Beſides all the ſinnes which in our infancie, and younger yeares,
euen before our calling, which on ignorance or weakneſſe wee
committed, are debts: in which reſpectHeb. 9. 7. 
                  the high Prieſt offered for
the errors of the people. Theſe are ſo many, as Dauid was moued
thereby to ſay,Pſal. 19. 12. 
                  Who can vnderſtand his errors? Yet becauſe they
were debts, euen the ſecreteſt of them, he deſireth to be clenſed
from them. Much greater debts are the ſinnes which we commit
after we come to riper yeares, or after our calling, againſt
knowledge and conſcience, wilfully and preſumptuouſly. Earneſtly
therefore doth Dauid pray to bePſal. 19. 13. 
                  kept from preſumptuous
ſinnes. So many are the ſinnes whereby, as by debts, we ſtand
obliged to the iuſtice of God, as they cannot poſſibly be all reckoned
vp. But the word DEBTS being indefinitly ſet downe in
the plurall number without reſtraint to any ſorts of ſinnes, import
all ſinnes.
               
                  Q. What inſtruction doth this implying of many ſinnes import?
               
                  A. Notice is to be taken of the manifold ſinnes whereby we ſtand
indebted to God.
                  Take notice of the multitude of ſinnes. Surely thoſe Saints of old did enter into a deepe
conſideration hereof, who acknowledged thatEzr. 9. 6.

more admired and magnified: and he himſelfe the more loued.
Luke 7. 47. 
                  Shee that had many ſinnes forgiuen, loued much.
               
               Little do they conſider the neceſſitie of this doctrine, who
neuer thinke of their ſinnes, or of ſeeking any diſcharge, but
when they haue committed ſome hainous notorious ſinne,
which bringeth them to ſome open ſhame, and then acknowledge
that ſinne onely, as if, that excepted, they were cleane
from all ſinne. I denie not, but that good vſe may be made of
faſtening the mind vpon one principall ſinne, which ſeemeth
moſt horrible to the conſcience, and maketh the partie moſt
aſhamed, and whereby he conceiueth Gods wrath to be moſt
prouoked, as the Iſraelites, who ſaid,1. Sam. 12. 19. 
                  We haue added to all our
ſinnes THIS EVILL: and Ezra, who ſaid,Ezr. 9. 14. 
                  Should we againe
breake thy commandements, and ioyne in affinitie with the people of
theſe abominations? And Dauid, where he ſaid,Pſal. 51. 14. 
                  Deliuer me from
bloud-guiltineſſe. For by this meanes our corruption and vileneſſe
will appeare in our ſight much greater. Yet are we not to reſt
onely in acknowledgement of ſuch ſinnes alone. If we obſerue
the fore-named confeſſions of Ezra and Dauid wee ſhall find
many other ſinnes reckoned vp.
               Let vs therefore learne how to ſet our ſinnes in order before
God. To this purpoſe we haue two excellent helpes. One
without vs. The other within vs. That without vs is Gods
Law. That within vs is our Conſcience. Gods Law ſheweth
what is amiſſe. Our Conſcience ſheweth what we haue done
amiſſe. Apply thy Conſcience to the Law, and thou ſhalt find
thy ſelfe guiltie of an innumerable companie of hainous ſinnes.
Theſe acknowledge: and hauing acknowledged what debts

thou canſt call to mind, and in particular craued pardon for
them; then becauſe many ſinnes daily paſſe from thee, whereof
thou takeſt no notice, pray in generall for pardon of all, and ſay
as the Pſalmiſt,Pſal. 39. 8. 
                  Deliuer me from all my tranſgreſſions. The burthen
of the leaſt ſinne is too heauie for thee to beare, it is ſufficient to
cruſh thee downe to the place of the damned. Were it poſſible
to be eaſed of all but onely one, that one retained would hold
thee in euerlaſting chaines vnder darkneſſe. It is therefore neceſſarie
that a diſcharge of all ſins be had.
               Hitherto of the thing acknowledged DEBTS. The appropriation
of them in this word OVR followeth.
            
            
               §. 118. Of the appropriation of ſinne to
our ſelues.
               
                  Q. IN what reſpect are the debts here mentioned ſtiled OVRS?
               
               
                  A. As they ariſe from our ſelues, and as we are the true
and proper cauſe of them, euen the principall authors and
practiſers of them. This particle of relation OVR is here vſed
in another ſence then it was in the former Petition.See §. 84. There
bread was called OVRS becauſe it was giuen to vs of God,Nemo habet de ſuo niſi mendaciū &amp; peccatum. Concil. Arauſ. can. 22. and
by that gift we had a right to it. Here ſinnes are called OVRS,
becauſe they proceed from vs: in which reſpect nothing is ſo
properly OVRS as ſinne.
               
                  Q. What learne we from this application of debts to our ſelues?
               A. Wee are the proper cauſe of the ſinnes which we commit. On
this ground ſaith the Prophet,
                  Hoſ. 13. 9. O Iſrael thou haſt deſtroyed thy
ſelfe.
               Sinne is a voluntarie action: and the will of man is free, ſo
as it cannot be forced to ſinne: as we ſhallSee §. 282. hereafter more fully
declare.Nemo ſe palpet: de ſuo Sathanas eſt. Tolle peccatū quod eſt tuum. Aug. in Ioh. tract 49. Onely hereby learne, that no man hath cauſe cauſe to ſooth
or flatter himſelfe. Of himſelfe man is as bad as may be. Sinne
being thine, take that away which is thine owne.
               The thing acknowledged (Debts) and appropriation of them
(our) being noted, the kinde of diſcharge (Forgiue) is
to be declared.
            
            
               
               §. 119. Of Gods free and full diſcharge
of mans debt.
               
                  Q. VVHat doth this word FOR GIVE import?
               
                  A. Freely and fully to diſcharge a debt.
Freely without any ſatisfaction on our part. Fully
without any reſeruation of any part of the debt to be exacted of
vs: but rather ſuch an acceptation, as if we neuer had bene in
any debt at all.
               To forgiue, is ſo to paſſe by an offence as neither to exact
nor to expect any thing, either in way of recompence,
or in way of puniſhment forit. Both recompence and puniſhment
are counted a kind of ſatisfaction, which is directly contrary
to remiſſion. It is noted of the ſeruant whoſe debt the
Lord forgaue,
                  Mat. 18. 25, 27. that he had nothing to pay: no recompence therefore
was giuen: yet was he not impriſoned: no puniſhment
therefore was taken. But that ſeruant that impriſoned his
fellow-ſeruant, forgaue not the debt, and yet he receiued no
part of the debt. For impriſonment is a puniſhment: and puniſhment
is a kind of payment, which he that is puniſhed is
ſaidPoenas pendere, expendere, dependere, dare, perſoluere, luere. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  to pay.
               
               Againe, though a man actually exact nothing for a debt, or
an offence, yet if he beare a reuengefull mind, or a grudging
heart, he is not thought truly to forgiue. Nay if he be not as
good friends with the debter or offender, as if he neuer had had
ought againſt him, he doth not truly forgiue him, but onely to
teeth outward, as we ſpeake. But Gods forgiuing is as true, full,
and euery way perfect as poſſibly can be: and therefore as it expecteth
no ſatisfaction, ſo it is accompanied with as gracious
an acceptation, as if no ſinne had bene committed.
            
            
               §. 120. Of the concurrence of Gods mercie and iuſtice
in the diſcharge of mans debt.
               
                  Q. CAn it ſtand with ſtrictneſſe of Iuſtice ſo freely and fully to
acquit ſinners?
               
                  A. 1. It is not againſt iuſtice that he who hath

an abſolute and ſupreme power ouer all, and is to giue an account
to none, ſhould freely forgiue any thing which is any
way due to himſelfe, whether it be dutie or penaltie.Exod. 33. 19. 
                  I will
ſhew mercie on whom I will ſhew mercie, ſaith this ſupreme Lord.
And againe,Math. 20. 15. 
                  Is it not lawfull for me to do what I will with mine
owne?
               
               2. Chriſt our Suretie in our ſtead, and for vs hathGal. 3. 13. endured
that penaltie which we by ſinne deſerued, andRom. 5. 19. fulfilled all that
righteouſneſſe which we owed.
               2. Q. Can ſatisfaction and remiſſion ſtand together?
               
                  A, Yes, in three caſes.
               1. WhenLuke 7. 42. the partie forgiuen neither doth nor can make
any ſatisfaction.Pſal. 143. 2. Such are we in regard of that debt which
we owe to God. No ſatisfaction therefore is exacted of vs in
our owne perſon.
               2. When his Sonne, who forgiueth, maketh the ſatisfaction.
Such a Suretie haue wee, who hath made ſatisfaction for our
ſinnes: euenIoh. 3. 16. 
                  the onely begotten Sonne of God, who is true God. So
as God hath made ſatisfaction to God.Rom. 8. 32.
               
               3. When hee who forgiueth, is no further bound to accept
the ſatisfaction which he doth accept,Heb. 6. 17. then by his owne
promiſe. What other bond can be alledged to binde God, then
that whereby he hath voluntarily bound himſelfe. So as all on
Gods part is moſt free. Freely he gaue his Sonne a ranſome.
Freely hee imputeth what his Sonne did and ſuffered, to vs.
Freely he accepteth vs in his Sonne. Freely he acquitteth our
debt. HereuponEph. 1. 7. the Apoſtle ioyneth our Redemption by Chriſts
bloud, Remiſſion of ſinnes, and the riches of Gods Grace altogether:
implying thereby that neither of theſe croſſe the other, but
that all of them may and do ſtand together. Chriſts ſatisfaction
is ſo farre from impeaching the freeneſſe of Gods grace, as it
doth the more commend the ſame. For it is much more grace,
and farre greater mercie in God, not to ſpare his onely begotten
Sonne, but to giue him for ſinners, then vpon his abſolute
prerogatiue without any ſatisfaction at all to forgiue ſinners.
Chriſt, the Sonne of Gods loue, is more highly eſteemed of
God then any ſatisfaction can be. But by the ſatisfaction which
the Sonne of God hath made, there is manifeſted a perfect

concurrence of infinite mercie, and abſolute iuſtice: and the
freeneſſe of Gods grace is clearely manifeſted, and highly magnified thereby.
            
            
               §. 121. Of mans diſabilitie to diſcharge
his debt.
               
                  Q. WHat doctrine doth this word FORGIVE imply?
               A. Man is not able to himſelfe to diſcharge the
debt of ſinne. If he were, what need forgiueneſſe?
This is the reaſon why the Pſalmiſt deſireth God not to enter
into iudgement with him,
                  Pſal. 143. 2. becauſe no man liuing can be iuſtified in his
ſight, namely of and by himſelfe. From Gods forgiuing of ſinne
the Apoſtle gathereth,Rom. 4. 5, 6. that man is not iuſtified by workes that is,
by any thing which he himſelfe can do.
               The recompence which is to be giuen for diſcharge of the
debt of ſinne, muſt be of infinite value and worth. For ſinne
being committed againſt an infinite maieſtie, prouoketh infinite
wrath, and ſo becometh an infinite debt. Can a finite creature,
as man is,Mat. 16. 26. giue a recompence of ſuch worth? What ſhall a
man giue in exchange for his ſoule?
               
               Nay, man hath by ſinne vtterly depriued himſelfe of all
manner of abilitie to do any thing that in any reſpect might
carrie any ſhew of recompence.Eph. 2. 1. He is dead in ſinne: Not ſufficient
of himſelfe ſo much as to thinke any thing as of himſelfe.
                  2. Cor. 3. 5.
               
               
                  But if it were granted that man were able of himſelfe to do
ſomewhat, what is that to God vnto whom the recompence
muſt be made?
                  Ioh. 22. 2, 3. Can a man be profitable vnto God? Is it any pleaſure
to the Almightie that thou art righteous? Or is it gaine to him
that thou makeſt thy wayes perfect?—35. 7. If thou beeſt righteous what giueſt
thou to him? Or what receiueth he of thine hand?
            
            
               
               §. 122. Of Popiſh Satisfaction.
               DEteſtable in this reſpect are many poſitions of Papiſts
concerning mans ſatisfaction for ſinne, by puniſhments
voluntarily vndertaken,Concil. Trid. §. 14 de oper. ſatisfact. cap. 9. or impoſed by Prieſts, or inflicted
by God: and concerning the merit of workes whereby
the guilt of temporall puniſhment for ſinne may be remoued.
               Some of the chiefeſt of thoſe poſitions I will ſet downe in
the words of their great Champion: becauſe the very expreſſion
of them is a ſufficient refutation of them.
               The Councell of Trent doth teach that God
is ſatisfied three wayes,Bellarm. de Poenit. lib. 4. cap. 4. By bearing patiently the
puniſhments and ſcourges which are inflicted by
God,

                   By vndertaking of our owne accord laborious
workes, and By vndergoing the penaltie
impoſed by the cenſure of Prieſts.
               Our Satisfaction is required,Ibid. cap. 9. that the wrong
done to God may be recompenſed, and the diuine

               We muſt ſatisfie by thoſe good workes which
are ours.Ibid. cap. 6.
               
               Satisfaction muſt be worthy,Ibid. cap. 9. and it muſt

               Gods grace aſſiſting,Ibid. we may after a certaine
manner truly ſatisfie out of that which is
our owne, euen to equalitie, and in that reſpect
iuſtly and of deſert.
               We haue workes of our owne,Ibid. whereunto wee
are not bound, by which wee may ſatisfie for
wrong done to God.
               
               
                  
Our workes as they come from the
Spirit of Chriſt dwelling in vs haue a
certaine infiniteneſſe,Ibid. and thereby alſo
a certaine equalitie with the wrong
whereby wee had troubled God by ſinning.
               Full remiſſion of ſinne,Ibid. cap. 15. ſo much as concerneth
all guilt of puniſhment,
                     Opera noſtra vtà Spiritu Chriſti in nobis habtant procedunt, quandam habent infinitatem, ac per hoc etiam quandam aequalitatem cum iniuria qua deum peccando affeceramus.
                     Plena peccati remiſſio, quoad omnem poenae reatum, premium eſt bonorum operum quae ſatisfactoria dici ſolent.
                     Opera laborioſa proſunt ad culpae remiſſimem, &amp; mortis aeternae liberationem.
                   is the
reward of thoſe good workes which are
wont to be called ſatisfactorie.
               Laborious workes are profitableIbid. cap. 12. for
remiſſion of ſinne, and for deliuerance
from eternall death.
               If by theſe and ſuch like poſitions, that which is due to the
all ſufficient ſatisfaction of Chriſt be not attributed to man, let
any indifferent reader iudge. Can the things which in theſe poſitions
are auouched, of recompencing wrong done to God, of
ſatisfying the diuine iuſtice, of a condigne, or worthy ſatisfaction,
of ſatisfying truely and properly, to an equalitie, iuſtly, condignely,
and that out of our owne workes whereunto we are not bound, of a
certaine infiniteneſſe of our workes, and a certaine equalitie with
the wrong whereby wee haue troubled God by ſinning, of full remiſſion
of ſinne to bee the reward of fatisfactorie workes, of the
profit of laborious workes for remiſſion of ſinne, and deliuerance
from eternall death, Can theſe things ſtand with Gods infinite
iuſtice, with mans diſabilitie to any good thing, with
mans vnworthineſſe, and with the imperfection of mans beſt
workes? Then may light and darkneſſe in their moſt extreme
degrees, then may the Arke of God, and Dagon, then may
Grace and Workes ſtand together: and yet the Apoſtle ſaith,
If by grace,
                  Rom. 11. 6. 
                  then it is no more of workes, otherwiſe grace is no
more grace. But if of workes, then it is no more grace, otherwiſe
worke is no more worke.
               
               They alleadge for grounds of the worth of mens workes
that,
               1. They come from the Spirit of Chriſt.
               2. Chriſt giueth the vertue of ſatisfaction to mens workes.
               3. Mans ſatisfaction is not for the fault, but for the puniſhment.
               
                  
4. The puniſhment for which man ſatisfyeth, is not eternall,
but temporall.
               To theſe I briefely anſwer, that
               1. Though the worke of the Spirit bee pure in it ſelfe, yet
comming from vs it receiueth a tincture: As water that comming
from a pure fountaine paſſeth thorow a foule chanell. Beſides,
the Spirit worketh according to the capacitie of the obiect,1. Cor. 13. 12.
not all fulneſſe and perfection at the firſt, but in part, by
degrees.
               2. For Chriſt to giue the vertue of ſatisfaction to mens
workes, is to make men Prieſts, and Sauiours: which offices
are his glory.Iſa. 42. 8. But he will not giue his glory to others.
               
               3. The fault being diſcharged by Chriſt, the puniſhment is
alſo thereby diſcharged.Sublata cauſa tollitur effectus. For the fault is the cauſe of puniſhment.
Take away the cauſe, the effect followeth and falleth away.
As God ſaid to Adam of the forbidden fruit,Gen. 2. 17, 2. Sam. 12. 13. 
                  In the day
that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt dye the d
                        •
                     ath: ſo Nathan ſaid to
Dauid, The Lord hath put away thy ſinne, thou ſhalt not die.
His ſinne being remitted, the puniſhment was remoued.
               4. That ſatisfaction which taketh away the greater puniſhment,
by iuſt conſequence taketh away the leſſe. If temporall
puniſhment as well as eternall were not diſcharged by Chriſts
ſatisfaction, it were not complete, but an imperfect ſatisfaction.
               But howſoeuer Papiſts being preſt by our vnanſwerable arguments,
to auoid them, doe vſe the forenamed diſtinctions of
ſatisfying for the puniſhment, &amp; no the fault, for the temporal,
and not for the eternal puniſhment: yet in their fore-named Poſitions
they apply mans ſatisfaction to the recompencing of wrong
dene to God, to diuine iuſtice, to remiſſion of ſin, and to deliuerance
from eternall death; and thereupon they attribute thereunto a
certaine infiniteneſſe, and equalitie to the wrong wherewith by ſinning
we haue troubled God. O blaſphemie!
            
            
               §. 123. Of humiliation and abnegation.
               AS the greatneſſe of the debt wherein man ſtandeth obliged
to God, ſo alſo mans impotencie, and impoſſibilitie
to diſcharge it, aggrauateth that wretched eſtate

whereinto man by ſinne is implunged, and giueth him much
more occaſion, and matter of humiliation. If there were iuſt
cauſe to weepe much,
                  Reu. 5. 4. 
                  becauſe no man was found worthy to open
the ſealed Booke; how much more cauſe of weeping and mourning
is there, that no man is able to cancell the Bils and Bonds
whereby wee ſtand indebted to God, or any way to diſcharge
that debt?
               Hath not man in this reſpect iuſt cauſe alſo to deny himſelfe,
and as a ſelfe-condemning Debter and Malefactor to caſt
himſelfe downe before the Mercy-Seat of God, and to craue
mercy and forgiueneſſe,Math. 18. 26. as that ſeruant in the Parable who had
nothing to pay?
               
            
            
               §. 124. Of the remiſſibleneſſe of ſinne.
               
                  Q. VVHat doctrine doth praying for pardon of the debt of
ſinne afford?
               
                  A. Sinne is remiſſible. If it could not be pardoned, it were
altogether in vaine to pray for forgiueneſſe. Chriſt would neuer
haue directed and incited vs to pray for that which is not
poſſible to obtaine.Mat. 7. 7. He ſtirreth vs vp to aske, ſeeke, and knocke,
on theſe grounds, It ſhall be giuen you, Yee ſhall finde, It ſhall
be opened vnto you.
               
               The true reaſons hereof are:
               1. The free grace of God.Epheſ. 1. 7.
               
               2. The price that Chriſt hath paid for this debt.1. Pet. 1. 19.
               
               The knowledge hereof doth
               1. Miniſter good ground of much comfort to poore ſinners
that groane vnder the heauy burden of ſinne.Math. 9. 2.
               
               2. Embolden ſinners in faith to ſeeke pardon.1. Ioh. 1 9.
               
               3. Prouoke and encourage them to turne from ſinne.Ezek. 33. 11.
               
               
                  Q. What doctrine may further be gathered from the application
of forgiueneſſe,Pſal. 103. 3. to debts in the plurall number?Quia fidelibus oratio iſta conuemat, &amp; Eccleſiae regula ipſa teſtatur, &amp; ipſius erationis exordium. Chryſ. hom. 20. in Math 6.
               
               
                  All the ſinnes of the faithfull are remiſſible. I ſay, of the faithfull,
becauſe they who haue right to ſay to God, Our Father,
(which the faithfull who are ſonnes of God onely haue) are
taught thus to pray, and becauſe they by the continuall and
powerfull aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit ſhall bee kept from falling

into the onely vnpardonable ſinne, the ſinne againſt the Holy
Ghoſt.
               As the free grace of God, and the price which Chriſt hath
paid are the cauſes, that ſinne is pardonable: ſo the infinite
riches of that grace,Numb. 14. 19. 1. Ioh. 1. 7. aud the all-ſufficiencie of that price are
the cauſes that all manner of ſinnes are likewiſe pardonable.
               Let no ſinne therefore keepe vs from ſeeking pardon.Qui orare nos pro peccatis docuit paternam miſericordiam promiſit, et veniam ſecuturam. Cypr. de Orat. Dom. §. 16. Well
note the gracious inuitation of the Lord, Iſay 1. 18. He that
hath taught vs to pray for pardon of ſinne, hath promiſed fatherly
mercy and pardon to follow thereupon.
               Of theſe two points, that Sinne, and that euery ſinne is remiſſible:
See in my Treatiſe of the ſinne againſt the Holy
Ghoſt. §. 5. &amp; 6.
            
            
               §. 125. Of Gods Prerogatiue in forgiuing ſinne.
               
                  Q. TO whom is this Petition for forgiueneſſe of ſinne directed.
               
                  A, To God. For euery Petition hath relation to
the Preface, and to him that is there deſcribed, which is God
onely.
               Q. What may thence be gathered?
               
                  A. 1. God hath power to remit ſinnes.Debitorum remiſſio proprium ac peculiare Dei munus &amp; officium eſt. Greg. Nyſſ. l. de Orat. Mar. 2. 7.
               
               2. God onely hath that power.
               As here, ſo euery where in Scripture we are directed to goe
to God for pardon: but no where throughout the whole Scripture
to any other. The Iewes ſo firmely held theſe doctrines
as they accounted it blaſphemie for any to arrogate that power
to himſelfe.
               Euery ſinne,
                  1. Ioh. 3. 4. as a ſinne is a breach of Gods Law: and in that
reſpect committed againſt him, though it be alſo a wrong done
to man. Now God being a ſupreme Lord ouer all, who can
bee imagined to haue power to forgiue tranſgreſſions againſt
him, and his Law?
               1. This Prerogatiue ſheweth that Chriſt is true God.Chriſt true God. Had
not Chriſt beene God, the Scribes had iuſtly accuſed him of
blaſphemie for taking vpon him to forgiue ſinne.Mar. 2. 5, &amp;c. Chriſt therefore
in anſwering their ſlander doth not deny their principle,

that God onely can forgiue ſinne, but by a viſible demonſtration
proueth himſelfe to be the True God, and thereby diſcouereth
their miſ-application of that true principle, whereby they denied
to him who was true God, his Prerogatiue, and in accuſing
Chriſt of blaſphemie, they themſelues were impious blaſphemers.
            
            
               §. 126. Of Papiſts blaſphemie in giuing to men
power to forgiue ſinnes.
               2. THe Pope aſſuming this Prerogatiue to himſelfe,Bonif. 8. in Extravag. Antig. Ioh. de Turrecr. in coment. dict. 1. de poenil. doth
thereby ſhew himſelfe to be plaine Antichriſt. For as
by his flatterers there is giuen to him, ſo hee aſſumeth to himſelfe
a power of granting Indulgences, Releaſes and Pardons
for ſinnes paſt,
                     
                        〈◊〉

full, ſome more full and ſome moſt full releaſes. Yea ſome of
theſe Releaſes and, Indulgences are oft extended to more
yeares to come,See §. 111. then can be imagined that the world ſhall continue.
               3. The power of abſolution which is alſo giuen by the
Church of Rome is derogatorie to the fore-named Prerogatiue
of God, and in that reſpect blaſphemous. For by the
§. 14. de. Abſol. c. 6. Can. 9. Councill of Trent it is decreed, not to be a miniſteriall declaration,
but a iudiciall act of forgiuing. Whereupon they inferre
thatVt flatus extinguit ignem, &amp; diſſipat nebulas, ſic Abſolutio Sacerdotis peccata diſpergit. Bellar. de Poen. l. 3. c. 2. 
                  as winde doth blow out a flame, and driue away clouds, ſo
the abſolution of a Prieſt doth put away ſinne: and that thereby
                  Ibid. l. 4. c. 9. 
                  both the fault, and alſo eternall puniſhment is remitted: and that
many are damned becauſe they die before they are abſolued of a
Prieſt. What is this but to make Prieſts Gods?
               
            
            
               §. 127. Of confeſſion of ſinne to God and Man.
               THe forenamed Prerogatiue of God doth plainely ſhew
that Auricular confeſſion,
                  Auricular confeſſion. as Papiſts enioyne it, is not abſolutely
neceſſarie. For they hold that a particular confeſſion of all
a mans ſinnes which he can call to minde is neceſſarily to bee
made in the eare of a Prieſt,Concil. Trid. §. 14. c. 5. Can. 6, 7, 8. and that vpon paine of damnation.
We deny not a neceſſitie of Confeſſion. For without

confeſſion of ſin, no remiſſion,Pro 28. 13. 1. Ioh. 1. 8, 9. no abſolution can be expected.
But this abſolute neceſſitie muſt bee applied to confeſſion vnto
God, whoſe Prerogatiue it is to forgiue ſinne. Yea further
we acknowledge a neceſſitie of confeſſion to man: and
that both publikely and priuately: and both theſe either vpon
iniunction by authoritie, or vpon a mans owne voluntarie motion.
Publike confeſſion is to be made of ſinnes publikely committed,
whereby publike offence is giuen, or publike detriment
and damage made. In this caſeIoſ, 19, 20. 
                  Ioſhua enioyned Achan
to confeſſe his ſinne, and he confeſſed it. BecauſeAct. 5. 8, 9. 
                  Saphira refuſed
to make confeſſion, being required of Peter to doe it, ſhe
was ſuddenly ſtrucke with death?Act. 19. 18. They of Epheſus that had
been notorious ſinners voluntarily made publike confeſſion of
their ſinnes. Priuate confeſſion is to be made alſo in three caſes.
1. When one in authoritie requireth it, as2. King. 5. 25. 
                  Eliſha required his
ſeruant Gehazi to doe it. 2. WhenMath. 5 24. priuate wrong is done,
or offence giuen to one. 3. When a ſinne burdeneth the conſcience:
on which grouud2. Sam. 12. 13. Iam. 5. 16. 
                  Dauid made confeſſion to Nathan:
and Saint Iames exhorteth all Chriſtians to confeſſe their ſinnes
one to another, that ſo they may receiue the more comfort by
mutuall prayer and direction. In this caſe choiſe muſt be made
of ſuch perſons as are fit to haue ſecrets made knowne to
them, and able to helpe and eaſe a burthened conſcience. Such
are men of vnderſtanding, diſcretion, wiſedome and experience,
yea ſuch as are faithfull, and pitifull, and beare a louing
heart toward the partie that commeth to them for comfort.
Among others, Miniſters are in two reſpects moſt fit. 1. Becauſe
by their dayly ſtudie and practiſe they are moſt acquainted
with the temptations of Satan, diſpoſitions of people, and
conſolations of Gods Word. 2. Becauſe by vertue of their
miniſteriall function,2. Cor. 5. 18, 20. being Ambaſſadours for Chriſt, and
hauing the ministerie of reconciliation giuen to them, the patient
may with more aſſuredneſſe apply to his ſoule the promiſes
which they pronounce.
               But neceſſarily to tye euery Chriſtian, vpon paine of
damnation, to make confeſſion of all the ſinnes whereof
hee knoweth himſelfe to be guiltie, to the Prieſt vnder whoſe
charge hee is, bee hee neuer ſo ignorant, or lewd, is without

all warrant of Gods Word, and againſt common ſence
and reaſon.
            
            
               §. 128. Of confeſſing ſinne to God, and ſeeking
pardon of him.
               5 FOr the maine dutie which ariſeth from the fore-mentioned
doctrine concerning Gods Prerogatiue in
forgiuing ſinne, let vs not dare to hide our ſinne
from God, asGen. 3. 7, 8. 
                  Adam ſought to doe, but humbly and penitently confeſſe the ſame,Iob 31. 33. asPſal. 32. 5.—51. 1, &amp;c. 
                  Dauid, and other Saints of
God from time to time haue done. This dutie is to be done
not ſo much to make our ſinnes knowne to God (For hee
knoweth them whether wee confeſſe them or no) as to
ſhew that wee our ſelues know them,Neh. 9. 3. take notice of them,Ezr. 9. 6, &amp;c.
feele the burden of them,Dan. 9. 4, &amp;c. are grieued for them, hate them,
deſire to bee freed from them, and truely repent of them.
Thus will God bee moued to take pitie of vs, and to bee
mercifull to our ſinnes. God is not like man who taketh
aduantage from the delinquents confeſſion, according to the
Prouerbe, Confeſſe and bee hanged, but rather from thence
taketh occaſion to ſhew mercy. In relation to God, this
may well come into a Prouerbe, Confeſſe and bee ſaued. For
if wee confeſſe our ſinnes,
                  1. Ioh. 1. 9. 
                  hee is faithfull and iuſt to forgiue vs
our ſinnes.
               
            
            
               §. 129. Of going to God for Pardon.
               6. GOds Prerogatiue to forgiue ſinne doth further embolden
vs to goe to him, and to him onely for pardon of
ſinne. In that ſinne is remiſſible, and may bee pardoned, we
haue encouragement to ſeeke for pardon. In that it is God
that forgiueth, wee are directed to ſeeke pardon of him. I,
euen I am hee,
                  Iſa. 43. 25. 
                  that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions, ſaith the
Lord. And well wee may be glad that hee reſerueth this prerogatiue
to himſelfe. For of whom can wee with greater confidence
expect to receiue this gracious fauour then of him,
who is full of compaſſion,
                  Pſal. 103. 8. 
                  and gracious, ſlow to wrath, and

plenteous in mercy.
                  
                     Ier, 2. 13. Fateor quia peccaui, &amp; conſcientia mea nou ſufficit ad ſatisfactionem. Sed certum eſt quod miſeri cordia tua ſuperat omnem offenſionem. Aug. Medit. cap. 39. Let vs not therefore leaue this fountaine of
liuing water, and goe to broken ceſternes that can hold no water.
As wee deſire to bee diſcharged of the debt of ſinne, ſo
let vs ſeeke this diſcharge of him that is able and ready to
giue it. Though we can make no ſatisfaction, yet his mercy ſurpaſſeth
all our offences.
            
            
               §. 130. Of Gods free and full diſcharge
of ſinne.
               
                  Q. VVHat doctrine ariſeth from the kindes of diſcharge implied
vnder the word FORGIVE?
               
               
                  A. The diſcharge which God giueth is
                  See §. 119. 
                  a free &amp; full diſcharge,
It muſt needs bee free, because in man there can be nothing to
procure it. Nay out of God there is nothing to moue him to
doe it.Iſa. 43. 25.—48. 9. 
                  I blot out tranſgreſſions, ſaith the Lord, for mine
owne ſake. And againe, For my names ſake will I deferre mine
anger.
                  Mic. 7. 18. 
                  He retaineth not his anger for euer, becauſe he delighteth
in mercy.
                  Benigniffima Diuinitatis natura liberaliter agit, ignoſcit plenarie. Bern. de Euan. 7. pan. Serm. 3. That the diſcharge alſo which God giueth is full, is
euident by the many Metaphors vſed in Scripture to ſet it out:
Such are theſe that follow.
               1. I am hee that BLOTTETH OVT thy tranſgreſſions,
ſaith the Lord. This Metaphor is taken from Creditors,
who when they purpoſe neuer to exact a debt,Iſa. 43. 25. will blot it
out of their bookes. After that a Debt is ſtrucken out of a Bill,
Bond, or Booke, it can not be exacted: the euidence can not be
pleaded.
               2 I haue put away thy tranſgreſſions as a cloud,
                  Iſa 44. 22. 
                  and thy
ſinnes as a miſt, ſaith the ſame Lord. Wee know that the
clouds which are driuen away by the winds appeare no more,
nor the miſt which is dried vp by the Sunne. Other clouds,
other miſts may ariſe: but not they which are driuen away and
dryed vp. Thus the ſinnes which God forgiueth returne not
againe.
               3. The ſame Lord ſaith, Though your ſinnes be as skarlet, they
ſhall be as white as ſhow;
                  Iſa. 1. 18. 
                  though they be red like crimſon, they ſhall
be as woll. Skarlet and crimſon are double and deepe dies, dies
in graine, yet if the cloth died therewith be as the wool before

it was died, if it be as white as ſnow, what is become of thoſe
dies? Are they any more? Is not the cloth as if it had not bene
died at all? Euen ſo, though our ſinnes, by reiterating them, by
long lying in them, haue deepely ſeazed into vs, yet by Gods
diſcharge of them, wee are as if wee neuer had committed
them.
               4. Ye are waſhed,
                  1. Cor. 6. 11. ſaith the Apoſtle. By waſhing the filth of
things is cleane taken away.
               5. Thou haſt caſt all my ſinnes behind thy backe,
                  Iſa. 38. 17. ſaith Hezekiah
to God. That which a man would not looke on, or regard, that
he caſts behind his backe. The ſinnes which God forgiueth he
will haue as out of his ſight, which he meaneth no more to
meddle withall.
               6. Thou wilt caſt all their ſinnes into the depths of the ſea,
                  Mic. 7. 19. ſaith
Micah to the Lord. When a man would haue a thing vtterly
gone, he will caſt it into the bottome of the ſea, from whence
there is no fetching it againe. So deales the Lord with the ſins
which he forgiueth.
               7. The Pſalmiſt pronounceth him bleſſed whoſe ſinne is couered.
                  Pſal. 32. 1.
A thing couered is not ſeene. So ſinne forgiuen is before God as
not ſeene.
               8. The ſame Pſalmiſt pronounceth him bleſſed to whom the
Lord imputeth not ſinne.
                  Pſal. 32. 2. A ſinne not imputed is as not committed.
               9. The Prophet ſaith of ſinne forgiuen,Ier. 50. 20. that it ſhall be ſought for
and not found. Is not that fully diſcharged which ſhall neuer be
found, neuer appeare?
               10. God himſelfe ſaith,Ier. 31. 34. 
                  I will remember their ſinne no more.
Surely that which God will not remember, hee hath fully diſcharged.
               Finally,Rom. 4. 6, 7. the man is pronounced bleſſed whoſe ſinne is forgiuen. If
the diſcharge were not full, how could the partie diſcharged
be by vertue thereof bleſſed?
               Forgiueneſſe being an Act of God, it muſt needs be both free
and full. For whatſoeuer God doth, he doth freely for himſelfe,
without any former deſert, without expectation of any future
recompence. No creature can deſerue any thing at his hands:
much leſſe can ſinners and rebels. Neither can any creature giue

any reward or recompence to him: as he needeth none, nor expecteth
any, ſo he can receiue nothing which is not his
owne.
            
            
               §. 131. Of Merit of Congruitie.
               THe
                     Rom. 11. 6. Illis operibusquae ex fide &amp; gratta proficiſcuntur fa temur nos mereri remiſſionem pec colorum. Bellar. Indic. de lib. concor. Mend. 8. Idem de Iuſtif. l. 5. c. 22. 
                  free diſcharge of God directly excludeth all merit of
man. For that which is done for merit is not freely done.Meritum de congruo &amp; condigno Bellar. de Poenit. lib. 2. cap. 12.
Papiſts who maintaine mans merit, not onely for his ſaluation
after this life, but alſo for his iuſtification in this life, and
for remiſſion of ſinnes, thinke to ſalue vp all by a diſtinction of
merit of Congruitie or meetneſſe, and condignitie or deſert and
worth. They ſay that merit of condignitie followeth iuſtification:
but merit of Congruitie goeth before it, and meriteth and obtaineth
both remiſſion of ſinnes and iuſtification.The whole Armour of God Treat. 2. Part. 4. §. 7. on Eph. 6. 14 Of that merit
of condignitie I haue elſewhere ſpoken: neither is it pertinent
to this place.
               
                  For merit of Congruitie:
               1. Though it be taken in the faireſt interpretation that can
be, yet can it not ſtand with free grace, with meere mercie: but
it much impaireth the ſame.
               2. When they expound their owne meaning, they acknowledge
that remiſſion of ſins and iuſtification is due as a recompence
or reward to the ſaid merit of Congruitie. For, ſay they, To
euery merit a reward anſwereth: as there is a merit of Congruitie, ſo
alſo a reward of Congruitie.
                  Omni merito reſpondet merces. Sicut meritum eſt ex congruo, ita merces ex congruo. Bellar. de Iuſtif. lib. 1. cap. 21. And the merit of Congruitie is rather
founded in ſome dignitie of the worke, then in the promiſe of God. Doth
not their owne expoſition of Congruitie make it a plaine condignitie
and deſert.
               3. When God firſt acquitteth and iuſtifieth a ſinner, hee
findeth in him no congruitie,Fundatur meritum de congruo potius in aliqua dignitate ope
                        •
                     s quàm in promiſſione. Ibid. to meetneſſe to receiue mercie,
but rather an enemie-like,
                     Rom. 5. 10. and rebellious diſpoſition againſt
him. For when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God.
                  
                     Eph. 2. 4, 5. And, God,
who is rich in mercie, for his great loue, wherewith he loued vs, euen
when we were dead in ſinne, quickned vs.
               
            
            
               
               §. 132. Of Popiſh ſatisfactions for
ſinnes remitted.
               GOds full diſcharge of ſinne excludeth all remainder of puniſhment
to be endured in this world, or elſewhere by
way of ſatisfaction for the ſin forgiuen. For it any ſatisfaction
remaine to be done, the diſcharge is not full. Derogatory therefore
to the abſolute fulneſſe of Gods diſcharge is the doctrine
of our Aduerſaries in this point. For they hold that after ſinne
is forgiuen,Concil. Trid. §. 6. cap. 14. &amp; §. 14. cap. 12. there may remaine a guilt of puniſhment to be ſatisfied
for, ſometimes in this life, ſometimes in another life,
namely in Purgatorie, ſometimes in both.Bellar. de Purg. lib. 2. cap. 1. &amp; 9. &amp; de Poenit. l. 4. cap. 2. But by ſuch puniſhments
for ſinne, ſinne would againe be cald to mind and memorie,
to view and ſight, to reckoning and account, which cannot
ſtand with the forementioned Scripture phraſes of not remembring,
not imputing, couering, caſting behinde the backe, caſting
into the bottome of the ſea, blotting out, &amp;c. We denie not but that
Saints whoſe ſinnes are forgiuen, may notwithſtanding be puniſhed
in this life (as for the fiction of Purgatorie it deſerueth
rather to be hiſſed at, then by arguments refuted) but withall
we ſay, that thoſe puniſhments are neither expiatorie, nor ſatisfactorie,
nor yet vindictiue for ſinne. If they were, Chriſts
expiation, ſatisfaction, and ſuffering might be thought inſufficient.
The puniſhments which are inflicted on them whoſe ſins
are forgiuen,Dolor medicinalis, non ſententia poenalis. Aug. in Pſal. 138. are as a medicinable corſiue, but not a iudiciall reuenge.
            
            
               §. 133. Of the comfort that ariſeth from Gods free
and full diſcharge.
               THe free and full diſcharge which God giueth of ſinne,Deus ſic ex toto indulſit, &amp; tam liberaliter omnem donauit iniuriam, vt iam non damnet vlciſcendo, nec confun
                        •
                     at improperando, nec minus diligat imputando. Ber. de Euang 7. pan. Serm. 3 is a
moſt ſound and ſoueraigne ground of comfort to ſuch as
by faith rightly can apply the ſame to their owne ſoules.
For ſo freely and fully doth God remit all offence, that neither
by reuenging it, doth he condemne vs: nor by vpbraiding it
confound vs: nor by imputing it the leſſe loue vs.
               A due conſideration of our many hainous ſinnes cannot but

aſtoniſh vs, and make vs aſhamed to appeare in the preſence of
God for pardon of them: but knowledge of the free grace of
God, (who of himſelfe, for himſelfe, for his owne names ſake
pardoneth ſinne) and faith therein, emboldeneth poore ſinners
to draw neare to the Throne of Grace, and to caſt themſelues
downe before Gods mercie-ſeate for pardon,Dan. 9. 18. and to ſay, We do
not preſent our ſupplications before thee for our righteouſneſſes, but for
thy great mercies.
               
               Againe, knowledge of the deſert of ſinne, how the leaſt ſin
deſerueth the wrath of God, and the leaſt degree of Gods
wrath is an vnſupportable burthen, cannot but affright the
ſoule of a ſinner through the apprehenſion of any vindictiue
puniſhment to be endured for ſinne. What then can remaine
to ſatisfie the poore ſinner, but faith in Gods full diſcharge? The
promiſes of God being the ground of our faith, good ground
we haue to beleeue that according to the forenamed promiſes,
our ſinnes, which we haue humbly and penitently confeſſed, and
for which wee haue craued pardon, are freely and fully diſcharged.
If vpon our owne true humiliation, and heartie ſupplication
we did beleeue this, what comfort, what peace might
be brought to our ſoules thereby? Let vs the efore oft meditate
on the fore-named grounds of faith, that our faith thereby
may be the more eſtabliſhed, and our conſciences the more
quieted.
               The thing acknowledged, DEBTS,
               
               The appropriation of them, OVR,
               
               The kinde of diſcharge, FORGIVE, haue hitherto bene handled.
               The parties to be diſcharged, VS, are now to be conſidered.
            
            
               §. 134. Of praying for the pardon of our owne
ſinnes eſpecially.
               
                  Q. VVHo are compriſed vnder this particle Vs?
               
               
                  A. We our ſelues, and others. The firſt perſon
includeth our ſelues. The plurall number
extendeth this Petition to others.
               
                  Q. What doctrine may thence be gathered?
               
                  A. Pardon is to be ſought for our owne and others ſinnes. Of

ſeeking pardon for our owne ſinnes no queſtion can be made.
Holy men of God guided by the Spirit of God haue done this
in particular, euen in the ſingular number for themſelues. Put
away MINE iniquitie,
                  Pſal. 51. 1, 2, 7. 
                  Cleanſe ME from MY ſinne, waſh ME, Purge
ME, ſaith the Pſalmiſt.
               Loue begins at home. If any dutie of loue be to be ſhewed
to our ſelues, then this eſpecially aboue all other. For if ſinne
bee not pardoned, what can be comfortable, what can be beneficiall
and profitable to vs?
               The application of this point concerneth not onely ſuch as
(through ignorance of that fearefull eſtate wherein they lie by
ſinne, or a prophaine neglect of this holy and heauenly dutie of
prayer) neuer call vpon God for this or any other bleſſing, in
their owne or others behalfe: but alſo, and that more eſpecially
ſuch, as through ſome violent temptation, and deepe apprehenſion
of Gods indignation againſt them, are afraid to pray for
pardon of their owne ſinnes, and yet can heartily pray for the
pardon of others ſinnes. Theſe muſt bee well inſtructed in this
priuiledge that is here afforded vnto vs: and in that reſpect
which God hath to the particular prayer which is made by a
penitent ſoule in his owne behalfe.Ezek. 14. 15. God oft heareth one praying
for himſelfe, when he heareth him not praying for others:
but we neuer heard of any accepted for others, that were not
accepted for themſelues. Euery ones prayer is moſt auaileable
for himſelfe. Let the mind that ſuch haue to pray for others, prouoke
them to pray firſt for pardon of their owne ſinnes. For
till a mans ſinnes be pardoned, hee cannot expect any bleſſing
on others by his prayers.
            
            
               §. 135. Of praying for pardon of others ſinnes.
               THat prayer is to bee made for others hath beene§. 14. &amp; 92. before
ſhewed. If for any other bleſſing we ought to pray in the
behalfe of others, then moſt of all for the pardon of their
ſinnes, the greateſt bleſſing, if the extent of it be well obſerued,
that in this world can be obtained for them. This was it for
which Moſes ſo earneſtly prayed in the behalfe of the Iſraelites:Exod. 32. 32. Iob 1. 5.
and for which Iob offered vp ſacrifices in the behalfe of

his children. That expreſſe precept which the Apoſtle giueth
of praying for others, hath eſpeciall relation to their ſinnes, as
the reaſon importeth in theſe words,Iam. 5. 14, 15, 16 
                  If he haue committed ſinnes
they ſhall be forgiuen him.
               
               That reaſon is a reaſon of great weight:Iam. 5. 20. for by obtaining pardon
of ſinne for another, ae ſoule is ſaued from death. What a priuiledge,
what an honour is this to a Chriſtian, that he ſhould
be a meanes of ſauing his brothers ſoule? What a benefit doth
he thereby bring to his brother? The Scripture giueth vs many
inſtances of the benefit of prayer in this kinde: namely, that it
hath bene a meanes of obtaining pardon for many ſinners: and
of preuenting or remouing many iudgements from them. Witneſſe
theExo. 32. 11. &amp;c many prayers which Moſes made for the Iſraelites
when they had ſinned againſt God:Num. 14. 19, 20. and in particular forNum. 12. 13. 
                  Miriam.
Witneſſe alſo2. Chro. 30. 18, 20. the prayer which Hezekiah made for the
people that came vnprepared to the Paſſe-ouer: andIob 42. 8, 9. the prayer
which Iob made for his friends that ſpake not of God the thing
that was right. No doubt butCōpare Luke 23 24. with Act. 2. 38, 41. &amp; 4. 4. the prayer which Chriſt made
on the croſſe for them that ſo euilly entreated him, was a
meanes that many thouſand Iewes anone after his aſcenſion
were conuerted, and had their ſinnes pardoned. The like may be
ſaid ofAct. 7. 60. 
                  Stephens prayer.
               Not onely to others may much good be brought by a conſcionable
performance of this dutie, but to our ſelues alſo. For
our faith in the pardon of our owne ſins will be much ſtrengthned
thereby. By praying for the pardon of others ſinnes wee
ſhall the better acquaint our ſelues with the extent of Gods
promiſes, which are the holy oyle to make the lampe of our
faith to continue her light.
               Learne we hereby to take notice of others ſinnes as well as
of our owne. Take we notice of the publicke open ſinnes of the
times and places where we liue, of thoſe among whom we conuerſe,
but eſpecially of thoſe who are vnder our charge. And
as we obſerue them, we ought to be humbled for them, to make
confeſſion of them to God, and ſupplication for pardon of
them.Ezra 9. 3. &amp;c. Hereof we haueRom. 14. 19. many excellent patternes in GodsNeh. 1. 6. &amp;c.—9. 16 &amp;c.
word.Dan. 9. 5. &amp;c.
               
               In performance of this dutie let our minds be eſpecially fixed

on the ſinnes of thoſe who are vnder our charge: and to whom
we are by ſome ſpeciall bonds linked: as Iob who prayed for
hisIob 1. 5. 
                  children and—42. 9. 
                  friends: andExo. 32. 32. 
                  Moſes for the people vnder his
charge. It is meete alſo to enlarge our prayer, ſo as the inhabitants
of the Pariſh, Towne, Citie, and Nation wherein we liue
may be compriſed therein: asDan. 9. 7, 8, 9. 
                  Daniel who confeſſed the ſins
of Ieruſalem, Iudah, and all Iſrael, and craued pardon for the
ſame Here we ought eſpecially to be mindfull of the ſinnes of
our Gouernours, and Miniſters, asNeh. 9. 34. the Leuits were of the ſinnes
of their Princes and Prieſts. Finally, our prayers in this reſpect
muſt be extended to our enemies: for which we haue both the
Mat. 5. 44. 
                  precept, andLuke 23. 34. 
                  patterne of Chriſt, and the patterne of theActs 7. 60.

               §. 136. Of mans forgiuing another.
               
                  Q. VVHich are the words wherein the Condition annexed
to the fifth Petition is expreſſed?
               
                  A. As we forgiue our debters.
               
                  Q. What are the diſtinct points here to be conſidered?
               
                  A. 1. The Dutie required, FORGIVE.
               2. The Perſons tied thereto, WEE.

               Q. What is the maine dutie here required?
               A. Mon muſt forgiue one another. Many precepts of Scripture
tend hereunto: as,Mat. 5. 39. 
                  Reſiſt not euill.
                  Rom. 12. 19. 
                  Auenge not your ſelues.
                  Col. 3. 13. 
                  Forbeare one another. Forgiue one another.
                  Rom. 12. 21. 
                  Ouercome euill with
goodneſſe. And anſwerable haue the practiſe of the Saints bene
from time to time. InſtanceGen. 50. 17, 20. 
                  Ioſeph,
                  Num. 12. 13. 
                  Moſes,
                  2. Sam. 19. 23.

                  Paul,
and others like them.
               
                  
This is an eſpeciall propertie of a Saint,Iam. 3. 17. and child of God, in
whom the wiſedome that commeth from aboue abideth. For that
wiſedome is peaceable, gentle, eaſie to be entreated, full of mercie and
good fruites. Hereby a manifeſt difference is diſcerned betwixt
that Spirit which cometh from aboue, and that ſpirit which ariſeth
from the fleſh: betwixt a regenerate and a naturall man.
By nature man is exceedingly proane to reuenge.Heathen hold reuenge lawfull. The heathen,
who were guided onely by the light of nature, diſcerned not
the excellencie and neceſſitie of this grace.Vlciſci te laceſſitus potes. Cic. de Orat. Their Philoſophers,
who were their Diuines, accounted it not vnlawfull to reuenge
wrongs.Odi hominem &amp; odero: vtinam vlciſci poteram. Cic. ad Attic. Sophocles in Electra. Euripides in Oreſte. Yea they held it a bounden dutie, and a glorious vertue
to ſeeke and take reuenge: inſomuch as if any notorious wrong
were done to a man and he taken away, before reuenge taken,
&amp; the ſuruiuing friends were negligent in reuenging the ſame,
they imagined that the ghoſts of the deceaſed would neuer
leaue haunting and terrifying thoſe suruiuing friends till they
had taken reuenge.
               Many among vs,Mans pronenes to reuenge. that are taught better diuinitie, do too
much nouriſh this corruption of nature. If they be wronged by
word or deed, they thinke it diſhonourable to put it vp, or
paſſe it ouer without reuenge: which is the cauſe of ſo many
chalenges as from time to time are giuen and taken: and of the
many mortall monomachies, and deſperate duells which are
daily vndertaken: yea and of many ſecret plots and practiſes
for doing ſome notorious miſchiefe, and for taking away the
very life of ſuch as haue done them wrong. If ſuch as are able
with better diſcretion, and more moderation to temper their
outward actions, well obſerue, and throughly trie their inward
diſpoſition, they ſhall find this ſprout of corrupt nature, reuenge,
too deepely fixed in them: yea they ſhall find many bitter
fruites thence ſprouting, in reuengefull thoughts and deſires,
wiſhing many miſchiefes to fall vpon them by whom they
thinke themſelues any way wronged. What is this but inward
reuenge? Surely reuenge is one of the moſt incurable ſores of
the fleſh. It is moſt hardly ſubdued and mortified. A good
ſigne therefore of renewed nature it is to forbeare reuenge and
forgiue wrongs: if at leaſt it be done in truth, from the heart, for
the conſcience ſake.
               
                  
Farre ſhort of the Chriſtians Goale doe they come,Euill to bee ouercome with goodneſſe. though
they thinke they goe farre in the Chriſtians race, who onely are
milde, gentle, kinde, and courteous till they be wronged, but
then are implacable, and will accept of no reconciliation, till
they haue taken reuenge for that wrong. They thinke it a
great glory that they can ſay, I runne into no mans debt, I doe
wrong to no man, I euen haue beene, and euer will be ready to doe
all offices of kindneſſe that I can. But if any abuſe mee any way
and wrong mee, they ſhall know whom they abuſe: and I will make
them repent the wrong which they haue done. My friend ſhall taſte
of my kindneſſe: but mine enemy ſhall know what I am able to doe.
The pretended goodneſſe of ſuch men wanteth the ſubſtance
of goodneſſe: it hath but a ſhew and ſhadow thereof. That is
ſound, ſolide, pure gold that abideth the flaming heate of the
fiery furnace. A mans goodneſſe cannot be proued to be ſound
till it bee tried by the fire of wrong, or offence. Dogs, Beares,
Tygers,Saeuis inter ſe conuenit vrſis. Iuiuen. Lyons, and the moſt ſauage beaſts that bee, can bee
quiet, and gentle till they be ſtirred and incenſed. A Prouerbe
ſaith The Diuell is good while hee is pleaſed. Behold then what
kinde of goodneſſe it is, whereof ſuch men boaſt. No better
then the goodneſſe of the moſt cruell creatures, not the Diuell
excepted. Doe what you can to a ſheepe, you cannot make it
ſnarle or bite. Doe but clap a Dogge on the backe, hee will
be ready to fly in your face. He therefore that being prouoked
is ſtirred vp to reuenge, retaineth his naturall doggiſh diſpoſition.
Hee that may iuſtly bee accounted a Lambe, or ſheepe
of Chriſts fold, and to haue the Spirit of the Lambe of God in
him, will recompence to no man euill for euill, but ouercome euill
with good.
                  
                     Rom. 12. 17. 21. To this height of goodneſſe doth the condition of
this Petition call vs.Non haec dixiſſe contentus eſtſed abundanius oftendere volens, quantum buius rei curam gerit, idipſum etiam ſpecialiter incul cauit poſt impletam orationis formulam, &amp;c. Chryſ. bom. 20. in Mac. 6.
               
               This dutie of forgiuing one another being the maine and
principall point intended in this condition added to the fift Petition,
which is the onely bie clauſe in the whole Lords Prayer,
and which Chriſt thought not enough to inſert in the Prayer,
but ſo ſoone as hee had ended his forme of prayer returned to
this point againe, and againe and againe preſleth it both affirmatiuely,
and negatiuely, ſhewing the aduantage of forgiuing,
and the damage of not forgiuing. For a further preſſing and

enforcing of it, I will endeuour to ſet out the Excellency, Vtilitie,
Neceſſity, Difficultie, and Raritie of it.
               
               1. For the Excellencie of it,Excellency of forgiuing. it is one of thoſe excellencies
wherein God himſelfe glorieth, thatExod. 34. 7. 
                  he forgiueth ſinne. Therefore
with great Emphaſis he ſaith,Iſa. 43. 25. 
                  I, I am he that blotteth out
thy tranſgreſſion for mine owne ſake. And with great admiration
of this excellencie ſaith the Prophet,Mic. 7. 18. 
                  Who is a God like vnto
thee that pardoneth iniquitie? They therefore that forgiue
wrongs ſhew themſelues like to God in this his excellencie.
Whereupon the Apoſtle hauing exhorted vsEpheſ. 4. 32. 
                  to forgiue, addeth,
as a further motiue to preſſe the dutie, this clauſe,—5. 1. 
                  Bee ye followers
of God as deare children. Herein man ſheweth himſelfe
a God to man: as on the contrarie by reuenge, hee ſheweth
himſelfe a very Deuill: Many, likeGen. 4. 23. 
                  Lamech, boaſt and glorie
in taking reuenge, as in a matter of great manhood, whereas
in truth it is a part of much baſeneſſe, and great puſilanimitie.
               2. For the Vtilitie of it,Vtilitie of forgiuing. If this queſtion bee asked, What
profit is there of forgiuing? I anſwer as the Apoſtle did of Circumciſion,Rom. 3. 1, 2. 
                  Much euery way. Thereby aſſurance of Gods forgiuing
our ſinnes is obtained. Wee are made more capable of
receiuing mercy from God. We ſhall haue much quietneſſe in
our ſoules. We ſhall appeare more amiable before men, bee
the better loued of them, and receiue more kindneſſes from
them. We ſhall auoid many miſchiefes whereinto wee might
implunge our ſelues by taking reuenge, and which both God
and man might bring vs vnto for taking reuenge.
               3. For the Neceſſitie of it;Neceſſitie of forgiuing. it is abſolutely neceſſary for Society
with men, and Communion with God. In regard of ſocietie
with men, there is no liuing in this world without a mind
willing and ready to forgiue wrongs: and that by reaſon of
the wrongs which others from time to time will doe to vs,
and wee to others. Wee liue here among many and ſundry
ſorts of people, and thoſe of diuers and different diſpoſitions:
ſome giuing offence in one kinde, others in another. If we be
forward to take reuenge of euery wrong, and haue not a minde
forward to forgiue, we ſhall neuer haue a quiet minde. Reuenge
will bee as a poiſon continually working in our ſoules,

exceedingly diſturbing and diſquieting them. And for our
ſelues, fleſh is in vs all: it abideth in the beſt, ſo long as they
abide in this world. By reaſon of the fleſh in vs wee are ſubiect
to many infirmities, whereby ſundry offences are giuen
to others, ſometimes on weakneſſe, and ſometimes on wilfulneſſe:
ſometimes on ſudden paſſion, and heate of bloud, and
ſometimes againe on deliberation and cold bloud. By reaſon
hereof we need that others ſhould beare with vs, and forgiue
vs. But if we forgiue not others, how can we looke that others
ſhould forgiue vs. 1. Our example in taking reuenge of
others, is a patterne to others to take reuenge of vs. 2. It is
iuſt with the Lord to ſuffer men ſo to doe, according to that
which Adoni-bezek ſaid,Iudg. 1. 7. 
                  As I haue done, ſo God hath requited
mee.
                  Mat. 7. 1. So much is oft expreſſely threatned. In regard of
Communion with God,
                  Luke 6. 37. there is no hope, no poſſibilitie of reconciliation
and atonement with God for ſuch as are ready to take
reuenge of men. Chriſt hath ſet it downe, as a ruled caſe, as
an inuiolable Law, more ſtable, and vnalterable then the Lawes
of the Medes and Perſians eſtabliſhed by the King,
                  Math. 6. 15. that, if yee
forgiue not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your heauenly Father
forgiue your treſpaſſes.
                  Math. 18. 27, 32, 33, 34. In the Parable wee reade that the Lord
who forgaue his ſeruants debt, recalled his grant, when hee
heard that ſeruant would not forgiue his fellow ſeruant.
               
                  Q. May then that remiſſion which God granteth be reuerſed?
               
                  A. 1. That which hypocrites preſumptuouſly aſſume to
themſelues,How remiſſion is recalled. without due conſideration of the conditions and
qualifications of the Goſpell, may. For it is an abſolution vniuſtly
taken before it is fully giuen. 2. That circumſtance in
the Parable is noted not ſimply to declare any reuerſing of
Gods grant, but to aggrauate the hainouſneſſe of reuenge, and
Gods hatred of it, and indignation againſt it. And it ſheweth
that though God in himſelfe be ready and forward to forgiue,
and could and would otherwiſe forgiue ſuch a Debtor, yet if
that debter bee hard-hearted to his brother, and forgiue not
him, neither will God forgiue.
               4, For the difficulty of it,Difficultie of forgiuing. wrath and reuenge cannot eaſily
be ſubdued. A combate, and a conqueſt in that combate is requiſite
thereto. The combate muſt be with our owne paſſions,

and the conqueſt muſt be ouer them, which conqueſt fleſh and
blood can neuer get. He that ruleth his ſpirit is mightier then he
that taketh a Citie.
                  Prou. 16. 32. Paſſions are exceeding violent, very dangerous
and pernicious. In vs there is a great proneneſſe to yeeld
vnto them. Our fleſh is very loth to ſtriue againſt them. What
hope then is there of any victory ouer them. Surely there muſt
bee more in vs then fleſh and bloud to ſubdue them.
               5.Scarcitie of forgiuing. For the Raritie, or ſcarcitie of it, I may iuſtly in the Prophets
ſence vſe theſe words of the Prophet,let. 5. 1. 
                  Runne yee to and fro
thorow the ſtreets, and ſee now and know, and ſeeke in the broad
places, if ye can finde a man, if there be any that forgiueth wrongs,
and paſſeth by offences. View the world, obſerue ſuch as are reputed
to haue a generous minde. Among them yee ſhall finde
Challenges ſent and taken, and deſpera
                     •
                  e Combates vndertaken
for euery flight wrong, for euery diſgracefull and diſpleaſing
word. Enter into the Citie, goe about the Country, marke
the diſpoſition of inhabitants in Citie and Country, and ye ſhall
finde among them for petty iniuries, and ignominious ſpeeches,
complaints to Iuſtices, Warrants, Arreſts, Actions, Impriſonments,
and ſutes in Law to the vtter vndoing of one another.
Innes of Court, Seates of Iuſtice, Vniuerſities, Yea, and
Pulpits are full of bittet inuectiues, ſpightfull calumniations,
and reuengefull defamations for euery offence, and that
ofttimes when the offence is rather taken then giuen. Men, Women,
Old, Yong, Rich, Poore, Brothers and Siſters, Fellow-ſeruants,
Neighbours, Friends, all of all ſorts, are exceedingly
giuen to reuenge. If the thoughts of men could bee ranſacked,
and the deſire of reuenge that therein lurketh be diſcouered, it
would then more euidently appeare that this grace of forgiuing
wrongs, which is indeed rare in the excellency of it, is alſo
exceeding rare in the ſcarſity of it: hardly to be found any where.
               If now the Excelleucy of a thing in it ſelfe, if the Vtilitie and
benefit which it bringeth to them that haue it: if the abſolute
Neceſſitie thereof for communion with God or Man: If the
Difficultie of attaining thereto: If the Raritie of it, being
ſuch as very few attaine vnto it, bee motiues to ſtirre vs vp
diligently and earneſtly to ſeeke after it, Motiues are not wanting
to ſtirre vs vp to vſe all meanes that may bee to ſuppreſſe

reuenge, and to worke in vs a readineſſe, and willingneſſe
to forgiue.
               This of the Dutie here required. The Time when it is to be performed
followeth.
            
            
               §. 137. Of ſpeedy forgiueneſſe.
               
                  Q. VVHat time is limited for forgiuing?
               
                  A. The Time preſent. The word is of the preſent
Tenſe,
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   
                  wee doe forgiue, which implyeth a preſent performance,
and a conſtant continuance. The time preſent hath an Oppoſition
both to the time to come, and alſo to the time paſt. Hee
that in the preſent doth a thing putteth it not off to the future,
contenting himſelfe with a purpoſe to doe it afterwards, as if
it were enough to ſay, I will forgiue: neither doth hee leaue
off to doe it, contenting himſelfe that heretofore he hath done
it, as if it were enough to ſay, I haue forgiuen. But ſo ſoone as
occaſion of doing it is offered, he doth it: and ſo long as the
occaſion continueth, he continueth to doe it.
               
                  Q. What doctrine may be gathered from the profeſſion of forgiueneſſe
in the time preſent?
               
                  A. We muſt preſently forgiue. So ſoone as occaſion of exerciſing
this duty is offered, it muſt be put in practiſe. As the
ſhadow ſheweth it ſelfe ſo ſoone as a body appeareth in ſunſhine,
ſo muſt forgiueneſſe as ſoone as a wrong is diſcerned.
When ye ſtand praying, forgiue.
                  Mar. 11. 25. Wee may not dare to ſtand vp to
pray, vnleſſe we forgiue. Is it not then requiſite that wee forgiue
inſtantly. To this purpoſe tendeth this prohibition, Let
not the Sunne goe downe vpon your wrath.
                  Epheſ 4. 26. His meaning is that we
ſhould not harbour heart-burning any whit at all.Non debuit occidere Sol ſuper iracundiam veſtram, &amp; multi ſoles occiderunt. Aug. hom. 42. in lib. 50. Hom. The phraſe
of not ſuffering the Sunne to goe downe on a thing, is prouerbiall,
and implyeth a ſpeedy redreſſe. Contrary hereunto doe they
who ſuffer many ſunnes to ſet on their wrath.
               Reuenge is a kinde of fire, which if it bee not preſently
quenched,Danger of delaying to forgiue. will ſoone proue vnquenchable. Nay it is a deadly
poiſon, which if it once ceaze on the ſoule will ſoone deſtroy
it. No fire, no poiſon of a more encreaſing nature then reuenge.
InſtanceGen 4. 5, 8. the reuenge and wrath incenſed in Cain againſt Abel,
                  
and in theMath. 26. 4. 
                  Scribes and Phariſes againſt Chriſt▪
                   It encreaſed to
bloud. Reuenge the longer it laſteth, the ſtronger it waxeth.
But forgiueneſſe is the onely meanes to quench that fire, to
expell that poiſon. Can then forgiueneſſe with ſafety bee
put off?
               Aſſuredly Satan will take great aduantage from the leaſt delay.Triall of one fitted to forgiue
Whereupon the Apoſtle aduiſeth to giue no place to the diuell.
But by putting off reuenge, wee giue much place to him.
               Hereby tryall may be made of a mind rightly fitted and prepared
for this duty of forgiueneſſe. It manifeſteth it ſelfe ſo
ſoone as occaſion is offered. So ſoone as the Lord had ſtriken
Miriam with Leproſie for the wrong ſhe did to Moſes, Moſes
to ſhew how ready he was to paſſe it by,Numb. 12. 13. and to forgiue it,
preſently prayed for her.
               But the deceitfulneſſe of their heart is euidently diſcouered,Delayed forgiueneſſe deceitfull.
whoſe forgiueneſſe conſiſteth onely in a purpoſe to doe it afterwards.
That which is truely purpoſed, will not alwayes remaine
a meere purpoſe: but, ſo ſoone as occaſion is giuen,
proue a practiſe. Many thinke it time enough to forgiue when
they goe to the Lords Table: yet it may be that ſuch goe to
that holy board but once a yeare.Si in domibus veſtris ſcorpiones eſſent aut aſpides, quantum laboraretis vt domus veſtras purgaretis &amp; ſecuri habitare poſſetis? Iraſcimini, inueterantur irae in cordibus veſtris, fiunt tot odia, tot ſcorpij tot ſerpentes, &amp; domum Dei, id eſt, cor vestrum, purgare non vul
                        •
                     is? Aug. Hom. 42. in lib. 50. Ham. Surely that forgiueneſſe
which is then intended cannot be ſound.Reuenge retained diuelliſh. It may iuſtly be ſuſpected
to bee more on vaine ſuperſtition, then true deuotion.
What if they die ſuddenly before that time, and haue no time,
no thought to forgiue, can they thinke it ſafe to depart out of
this worſd with a reuengefull minde? I would gladly know of
ſuch whether they intend to pray before that time ſet for receiuing
the holy Communion. If they doe intend ſo to doe,
can they thinke it well to pray in wrath? Did men know
what a Wolfe, what a Tyger, what a Viper wrath and reuenge
were, they would at the firſt ſight thereof be ſtartled, and get
themſelues as farre from it, as they could. If Scorpions and
Aſpes were in mens houſes, what paines would they take to
cleanſe their houſes, that they might dwell ſecurely? But they
keepe anger, wrath, malice, hatred, reuenge, which are ſo
many Scorpions, and Serpents, and cleanſe not the houſe of
God, which is their heart. Yea ſuch a peruerſe diſpoſition haue
many, as they vſe all the meanes they can to retaine, and nouriſh

reuenge, and to keepe it in minde and memory. By
oath, by imprecation, and other wayes they will binde themſelues,
not to forgiue. They forbeare not to ſay, I may forget
the wrong, but I will neuer forgiue it. Hereby they prouoke God
to keepe their ſins in perpetuall memory, and to binde himſelfe
to execute vengeance on them.
            
            
               §. 138. Of conſtant forgiuing.
               
                  Q. VVHat other doctrine may bee gathered from the
profeſſion of forgiueneſſe in the time preſent?
               
                  A. Forgiueneſſe muſt bee a continued act. It
muſt not, ſo long as we liue, be reckoned among the things vtterly
paſt, and no more to be performed. The time paſt hath
his date. The time to come may haue no date at all. The time
preſent is alwayes in being. God therefore ſetteth out his eternall
being and abiding by the time preſent, in this Title, I
AM THAT I AM.Exod. 3. 14. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . LXX. Interpr. Hee therefore that in truth ſaith, I doe
forgiue, muſt neuer bee of another minde: hee muſt neuer
thinke of recalling what he hath forgiuen, or of waxing wearie
of forgiuing, though neuer ſo many wrongs from time
to time be offered.Mar. 11. 25. Chriſt ſaith, when yee ſtand praying, forgiue.
                  1. Theſ. 5. 17.
And his Apoſtle ſaith, Pray continually. If we muſt pray
continually, and praying forgiue, them muſt we forgiue continually.Math. 18. 22.
Where Chriſt enioyneth to forgiue vnto ſeuenty times
ſeuen, he intendeth a readineſſe to forgiue ſo oft as wee are
wronged,Synecdoche. be we wronged neuer ſo oft. A ſet and definite number
is put for an indefinite.
               Conſtant continuance in a good thing is that which ſetteth
the crowne vpon it, and maketh it not to bee in vaine.
But intermitting, and omitting that which is well begun,
taketh away the glory thereof. Reuenging after-wrongs, prouoketh
God to paſſe by without reward or regard our forgigiuing
of former wrongs.
               Let vs not therefore bee ouercome of euill:
                  Be not ouercome of wrong Rom. 12. 21. but rather ouercome
euill with goodneſſe. Wee haue need, in regard of that
extent of duty here required, to take vnto our ſelues an inuincible
reſolution. For while wee liue in this world, it cannot

be but that we ſhall haue wrongs offered vnto vs. It is not
without cauſe that the Apoſtle aduiſeth to Let patience haue her
perfect worke.
                  Iam. 1. 4. The perfect worke of patience conſiſteth, as in the
truth of it, whereby it is ſound, not fained, ſo in the extent of it,
that it reach to all kinds of wrongs and offences, and in the
continuance of it, that it endure to the end. The
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . notation of
the word which the Apoſtle vſeth, implyeth this laſt branch of
perfection, which is a perſiſting to the end, euen to the end of
this mortall life wherein wee ſhall haue vſe and need of exerciſing
this duty of forgiueneſſe. We may not therefore ſo much
conſider what wrongs and offences we haue forgiuen, as how
many more we may hereafter take occaſion to forgiue: that
by our continuall practiſe of this duty, wee may day after day
ſay, I doe forgiue.
               
               Thus much of the Duty required. The Parties tyed thereto, are
next to be conſidered.
            
            
               §. 139. Of dealing with man, as we deſire God
ſhould deale with vs.
               
                  Q. VVHo are eſpecially tyed to the condition of the fift
Petition?
               
                  A. They who call God Father, and craue forgiueneſſe of
him. For this Particle WEE in the condition, and the Particles
OVR, VS, in the Preface, and in the Petitions, are all of the
ſame Number and Perſon, and haue a mutuall reference to the
ſame perſons.
               
                  Q. What doctrine hence ariſeth?
               A. Saints that craue and expect mercy of God are moſt bound
to ſhew mercy to man. This did the Lord preſſe vpon his ſeruant
thus, I forgaue thee all thy debt becauſe thou deſiredſt mee:
ſhouldeſt not thou alſo haue had compaſſion on thy fellow-ſeruant,
euen as I had compaſſion on thee? This alſo doth the Apoſtle eſpecially
preſſe vpon Profeſſors,
                  Epheſ. 4. 4, 5, 6. 
                  as theſe Reaſons ſhew, There is
one body, and one Spirit, euen as yee are called in one hope of your
Calling: One Lord: one Faith: one Baptiſme: one God and Father
of all.
               By the mercy which Saints, that craue and expect mercy

from God, ſhew, both God that forgiueth them, and Chriſt, for
whoſe ſake God forgiueth them, are moſt glorified. The Goſpell
alſo and their profeſſion thereof, are moſt graced, and honoured
thereby; yea and the mouthes of ſuch enemies as watch for occaſions
to diſgrace profeſſors of the Goſpell, are ſtopped. Finally
the mutuall good of the members of Gods Churches is
hereby much promoted.
               What great and iuſt cauſe of complaint is in theſe reſpects
giuen,Quarrels of Profeſſors. by reaſon of the teachy, wrathfull, reuengefull diſpoſition
of many that in profeſſion of Religion are very forward. Of
thoſe who in outward profeſſion make their houſes Gods
Churches by the dayly exerciſes of piety therein,This complaint againſt quarrels of Profeſſors is not made as an inuectiue againſt profeſſion, but againſt ſuch as abuſe profeſſion, and made it a cloak to 
                        •
                     ouer their hypocriſie. conſtantly offering
vp their morning and euening ſpirituall ſacrifices, who
alſo by frequenting the houſe of publike prayer, the miniſterie
of the Word, the Lords Table, and other ſeruices of God, make
great ſhew of much piety, haue the name of Saints, and ſeeme
to expect much mercy from the Lord, of thoſe, I ſay, there be
many who are full of enuy, wrath and reuenge, very quarrellous
and contentious, ready to arreſt, to bind to the Peace and good
behauiour, to caſt into Priſon, to commence ſuites in Law, and
enter actions of treſpaſſe of defamation, and of other like pettie
matters vpon very ſleight occaſions. The Prophet foretold
the Wolfe ſhould dwell with the Lambe,
                  Iſa. 11. 6. 
                  and the Leopard lie d
                        •
                     wne
with the Kid, &amp;c. But now ſuch as profeſſe themſelues to bee
Lambs, and Kids of Chriſts flocke can ſcarce dwell quietly one
by another. Many Profeſſors are as very fire-brands as any other.Iam. 1. 27.
Surely their profeſſion and religion is vaine. They mocke
God, they deceiue man, they lie againſt their conſcience, when
they ſay, We forgiue. Their ſinne is the greater, in that thereby
they open the mouthes of prophane perſons againſt the Goſpell
of Chriſt, and a profeſſion thereof.
               Let vs who call God, Father, who craue, who expect
mercie of God, learne with what mind to do it: namely,
with a mind ready and willing to do for others what we deſire
to be done for vs. Lift vp pure hands without wrath,, thou that
deſireſt God to turne away his wrath from thee. Shew mercie
thou that craueſt mercie of God. Be bountifull, thou that longeſt
to taſte of the ſweetneſſe of Gods bountie. Forbeare thy

brother, thou that wouldeſt haue God forbeare thee. So deale
in euery other reſpect, as thou prayeſt God to deale with thee.
This is acceptable to God. This well becommeth thy profeſſion.
This will bring much comfort to thy ſoule. Thus ſhall not
thy prayer be made in vaine.
               The Dutie and Parties moſt bound thereto being declared, The
Perſons to whom the dutie is to bee performed are to bee
ſet out.
            
            
               §. 140. Of the ſeuerall kinds of debts whereby we
become debters to man.
               
                  Q. VVHo are meant by DEBTERS?
               
               
                  A. Such as any way wrong man. For the
Apoſtle ioyneth together theſe two phraſes,
Philem. v. 18. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  wronged, endebted. So many wayes as one wrongeth another,
he becometh a debter to him. But one may wrong another (according
to thoſe ſeuerall, diſtinct heads of duties which the
law enioyneth to bee performed to our neighbours) fiue
waies.
               1. In his place or dignitie. HereinNumb. 12. 2. 
                  Aaron and Miriam,
                  —16. 3. 
                  Corah, Dathan and Abiram became Debters to Moſes. They
ſpake againſt that authoritie, eminencie, and dignitie which
God had giuen him.
               2. In his Perſon or life. Herein1. Sam. 19. 10, 11. &amp;c. 
                  Saul became a debter to Dauid
by perſecuting his perſon, and ſeeking to take away his life.
Herein alſoActs 2. 23. the Iewes were debters to Chriſt.
               
               3. In his chaſtitie. Herein1. Sam. 25. 44 
                  Phalti and Michal became debters
to Dauid, in that (2. Sam. 3. 14. 
                  Michal being Dauids wife) they two
as man and wife liued, and kept, companie together.
               4. In his goods. Herein Oneſimus became a debter to Philemon,
by running from him, and purloyning his goods, which moued
Saint Paul to ſay,Philem. v. 18. 
                  If he haue wronged thee, or oweth thee ought,
&amp;c.
               5. In his good name. Herein2. Sam. 16. 7, 8. 
                  Shemei became a debter to Dauid,
by reproaching him, and calling him a man of bloud, a man
of Beliall.
               
               All theſe wrongs hath God expreſly forbidden in his Law:

ſo as they are double debts. One as tranſgreſſions againſt God.
The other as iniuries againſt men. The later of theſe kinds of
debts is here meant in this condition. Of that kind are all the
forenamed inſtances.
            
            
               §. 141. Of making ſatisfaction for wrongs
done to man.
               
                  Q. VVHat doctrine doth this title DEBTERS applyed to
wrongs do
                     •
                  e to men, imply?
               A. Wrong doers muſt make ſatisfaction for the
wrong which they do. Euery wrong is a debt. But a debt muſt
be ſatisfied, according to this chargeRom. 13. 8. 
                  Owe nothing to any man.
Leu. 6. 2 &amp;c. Numb. 5. 7. God gaue to the Iſraelites an expreſſe law for reſtitution or ſatisfaction
of that wherein one had wronged another.
               By ſatisfaction, as by a plaiſter, the wound which is made is
healed, and ſo wrong becometh to be as no wrong.
               The truth of repentance for the wrong which is done, is alſo
manifeſted by ſatisfaction.Luke 19. 8. 
                  Zaccheus hereby gaue euidēce of his
vnfeigned repentance. Were it poſſible to make ſatisfaction for
the debts wherein we ſtand bound to God, we ought to do it.
But becauſe by reaſon of the infiniteneſſe of that debt wee are
not in any ſort able to ſatisfie it, Chriſt, who is able, hath vndertaken
it. He is become our Suretie, He hath diſcharged our
debt. So as in regard of our debts to God, all that is expected
of vs for ſatisfaction thereof, is by a true faith to apply the ſatiſfaction
of Chriſt. But becauſe wee may be profitable to man,
&amp; may make ſome recompence for that wrong we haue done to
him, we ought in this caſe to do to the vttermoſt of our power
what we can.Pollicetur ſibi magnae 
                        •
                     wrae fore
vt omnia ciuitatibus quae cuiuſ
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                     , fuiſſent reſtituerentur. Cic. in Ver. Aut vim fieri vetat, aut reſtitui factam iubet? Idem pro Cecin. He that is carefull to make ſatisfaction, ſheweth
that he is ſenſible of the wrong he hath done, and would if it
were poſſible, that it had not bene done: which implyeth a penitent
heart.
               Beſides, common iuſtice and equitie requireth ſatisfaction
in what we are able. The heathen by the light of nature well
diſcerned as much; and haue giuen many good directions thereabout.
What a ſhame would it be for them that haue the light
of the Goſpell added to that light of nature, more to liue in

darkneſſe, and more to loue the workes of darkneſſe, then
they did?
               
                  Obiect. They to whom men are indebted muſt forgiue their
debters. Why then ſhould debters thinke of reſtitution or ſatisfaction?
               
                  Anſw. 1. That dutie of forgiueneſſe is required in caſe that
a debter cannot through diſabilitie, or will not through obſtinacy
make ſatisfaction. But it giueth no libertie to him that is
able, to bee willfull in refuſing to do what hee is bound
to do.
               2. Gods requiring mercie of one, doth not iuſtifie iniuſtice
and iniurie in another.
               Wherefore let euery one looke to that eſpecially which belongeth
to him:Redreſſe wrong and obſerue wherein he hath wronged another,
to do him the beſt right that he can: and that according
to the wrong which hee hath done. If it be a wrong knowne,
humbly to acknowledge the ſame to the partie wronged.
If an inferiour haue wronged his ſuperiour by any diſloyaltie,
let him bee the more loyall for the time to come. If one
vnder ſubiection haue bene rebellious, let him be the more
ſubmiſſiue and obedient. If one who owed ſeruice to another
haue bene negligent or careleſſe in his buſineſſe, let
him be the more induſtrious and diligent. Let him that hath
any way dealt vnmercifully with another, take all occaſions
to ſhew the more mercie to him. He that hath any way
defrauded another, let him to his vttermoſt power make full reſtitution.
He that hath impeached the good name or credit of
another, let him endeauour to right him whom he hath diſcredited,
in his reputation. And ſo in other wrongs. Thus will
there be an healing of the wounds that haue bene made. And
this is fruite worthie of repentance,
                  Math. 3. 8. which we are commanded to
bring forth. Note this all ye that by word or deed haue offended
any. Adde not obſtinacie to iniurie. Perſiſt not in wrong.
That is to make the ſinne out of meaſure ſinfull. To your ſinne
your iudgement ſhall be anſwerable.
               As for ſuch, as hauing done wrong refuſe reconciliation when
it is offered, ſurely they haue a diuelliſh ſpirit. Such were they
of whom the Pſalmiſt thus complaineth,Pſal. 120. 6, 7. 
                  My ſoule hath long dwelt

with him that hateth peace. I am for peace, but when I ſpeake, they
are for warre. Theſe are fire-brands in the ſocieties where they
are. More fit to liue in hell among diuels, then on earth among
men.
            
            
               §. 142. Of departing from our right.
               
                  Q. WHat other doctrine may bee gathered from this metaphor
DEBTERS in relation to the dutie of forgiuing?
               A. To forgiue we muſt part with our right. For a debter to pay
what he oweth is a right, due to the creditor. But a debter muſt
be forgiuen. This cannot be, except the Creditor let go his
right: and forbeare to exact that, which, were it not for this dutie
of forgiuing, he might exact. Saul hauing ſhewed himſelfe
a profeſt mortall enemie againſt Dauid, acknowledged, that
Dauid, when he had him in his power, might haue killed him:
ſo as in ſparing him, Saul acknowledged that Dauid departed
from his right.1. Sam. 24. 18, 19. 
                  Thou haſt ſhewed this day (ſaith Saul to Dauid)
how thou haſt dealt well with me: foraſmuch as when the Lord had deliuered
me into thine hand, thou killedſt me not. For if a man find his
enemie, will he let him go well away? The truth is, that Dauid was
by all law bound to ſpare Sauls life, and to forbeare all reuenge
againſt his perſon, becauſe he was with his Soueraigne:
which1. Sam. 24. 5, 6. 
                  Dauid well knew, and accordingly hee profeſſed as
much: but—18, 19. in Sauls opinion he departed from his right: which
he did in truth in2. Sam. 19. 22, 23. 
                  Shemeis caſe. We haue a worthy patterne for
departing from ones right for peace ſake in theMat. 17. 26. 27 example of
Chriſt, who though hee were able to proue that hee was not
bound to pay tribute, yet payd it. So1. Cor. 9. 15. S. Paul did forbeare to exact
that of the Churches which he might haue done.
               If a man haue no right to exact that which he ſeemeth to
forgiue, his forgiueneſſe is no forgiueneſſe. It is no worke of
mercie.
               The common practiſe of men,Vttermoſt of right not alwaies to bee ſtood vpon. in ſtanding to the vttermoſt
for their right, cannot ſtand with the equitie of that which is
here profeſſed, We forgiue our debters. In all manner of wrongs
to a mans place, perſon, chaſtetie, goods, or good name, there
is a kind of right for a man to take reuenge, and ſuch a right, as

it may be, is not condemned, but rather iuſtified by mans law.
What kind of debt then can be forgiuen, if that, which may bee
thought mans right, be exacted to the vttermoſt? Quarrels, contentions,
needleſſe but harmefull ſuites in Law, diſturbances of
peace, and other miſchiefes for the moſt part ariſe from mens
ouerſtrict ſtanding to that which they conceiue to be their right,
from which they will not yeald one heires breadth. If the Law
giue a man aduantage againſt his neighbour for a reproachfull
word, for a ſudden though light blow, for a treſpaſſe on his
Land, for any forfeiture, or the like, that aduantage is taken by
many: and therein they thinke they do what they may do: and
yet for all that, therein they may do much wrong: for oft times
Extreame right is extreame rigour.
                  Summum ius ſumma iniuria. Learne wee more to weigh
what Chriſtian equitie and charitie requireth vs, then what
conceipt of our owne right, or extremitie of humane Law may
egge vs on to do. Thus will peace, vnitie, amitie, and charitie be
preſerued and contiuned among men.
            
            
               §. 143. Of forgiuing all ſorts of
Debters.
               
                  Q. VVHat doctrine doth the expreſſing of Debters in the
plurall number import?
               A. All ſorts of Debters muſt be forgiuen. The
Debters here haue no limitation. Forgiueneſſe therefore muſt
haue no reſtraint. Whoſoeuer do offend, friend or foe, neighbour
or ſtranger, great or meane, rich or poore, inferiour or ſuperiour:
In whatſoeuer any do offend and wrong vs, in our place,
perſon, chaſtitie, goods, or good name: yea if one man ſhall in
many offences, or oft in one offence become a debter, and in
that reſpect be as many debters: forgiueneſſe in all theſe, and in
all other like caſes muſt be granted.Philem. v. 17. S. Paul requireth Philemon
to forgiue his inferiour, his ſeruant.1. Sam. 24. 7. 
                  Dauid forgaue his ſuperiour,
his Soueraigne.Num. 12. 2, 13. 
                  Moſes forgaue the wrong done to his
place and dignitie.Act. 7. 60. 
                  Stephen forgaue the wrong done to his perſon
and life. Dauid forgaue the wrong done to his2. Sam 3. 14. 
                  chaſtitie and
to his—19. 23. 
                  good name. The forenamed wrong which Philemon was
required to forgiue was in goods. Many, many were the wrongs

which the Prieſts, Scribes, Phariſes, and other Iewes did to
Chriſt, yetLuke 23 34. he forgaue them all.
               Mercie hath no ſtint ſet vnto it. It is as a ſpringing fountaine
which can neuer be dried vp. Though neuer ſo much be fetched
from it continually, yet it euer remaineth full.1 Cor. 13. 4, 7. 
                  Charitie is bountifull,
it beareth all things,
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  beleeueth all things, hopeth all things, endureth
all things. Forgiueneſſe therefore, being a worke of mercy
and charitie, is of the ſame nature and condition.
               As for the kind of debts, the greater they be, or the more it
goeth (as we ſpeake) againſt the haire, againſt our corrupt diſpoſition
to forgiue them, the greater is our glorie in forgiuing
them. To forgiue a ſmall debt, a ſmall wrong, is ſcarce thankſ-worthy.
He is worſe then a ſauage that can paſſe by nothing.
               Hereby further triall may be made of the truth of forgiueneſſe,Triall of true forgiueneſſe.
whether it flow from the forenamed fountaine of mercie
and charitie, or be forced, and performed on bie reſpects. If it
extend it ſelfe onely to ſome Debters (whom for kindred or
friendſhip ſake, or for hope of recompence, or for feare of greater
miſchiefe, or for ſome other like bie reſpects we are willing
to forgiue) and not to all ſorts of debters: or to ſmall debts and
wrongs (the forgiuing whereof is ſcarce thankſ-worthie) or
otherwiſe if it be drawne drie by the multiplication of debts:
and after ſome debts forgiuen it be no more to be found, ſurely
it is not true forgiueneſſe: it floweth not from the right fountaine
and head. By this note of tryall may many be found faultie
in the condition here required: the extent whereof as it is
to be applyed to enemies who moſt incenſe the wrath of man:
ſo to neighbours, who, by reaſon of the many occaſions of offence
through their continuall commerce, do moſt often prouoke:
yea and to friends alſo, from whom offences are moſt
vnkindly taken. All muſt be forgiuen.
               
                  After the Dutie required, the Perſons tied thereto, and the
Parties to whom it is to be performed, The Peſtraint
thereof in this word OVR followeth to be handled.
               
            
            
               
               §. 144. Of forgiuing our owne Debters.
               
                  Q. VVHy is this particle of reſtraint, OVR, applyed to
thoſe Debters whom we muſt forgiue?
               A. 1. To diſtinguiſh them from Gods Debters.
               2. To diſtinguiſh them from other mens Debters?
               Q. What doctrine ariſeth from this reſtraint?
               A. Euery one muſt meddle with his owne debts.
                  Luke 11. 4. Saint Luke maketh
this doctrine moſt cleare,Securus huius orationis fiducia de ſuis admiſſis veniam poſtulabit, quiſquis re miſſus erga ſuos duntaxat, non erga domini ſui extiterit debito res. Abb. Iſaac de Orat. cap. 21. by ſhewing who are our debters,
namely, Euery one that is indebted to Vs. He ſaith To vs, not to
others. Duely weigh all the places where this duty of forgiuing
is preſſed on man, and you ſhall find it limited with this
reſtraint. Gods word layeth no charge on man either to forgiue
Gods debts, or other mens debts.
               True mercie, charitie, patience, and wiſedome, is exerciſed in
forgiuing our owne debts onely: and thereby are theſe vertues
beſt diſcerned to be ſound and good.
               It is intolerable preſumption for man to take vpon him to
forgiue Gods debts, which are ſinnes: as we haue§. 126. before noted.
One man may pray to God for ſuch as ſinne (asActs 7. 60. 
                  Stephen
did) that God would not lay their ſinne to their charge: and by
that meanesIam. 5. 15. 
                  ſinne may be forgiuen: but no man can himſelfe
actually forgiue any ſinne.
               1. Obiect.2. Sam. 12. 13. Nathan forgaue Dauids ſinne.
               
               
                  Anſw. He onely pronounced remiſſion of his ſinne in the
name of the Lord. His words are expreſſe, The Lord hath put
away thy ſinne.
               
               2. Obiect.
                  Ioh. 20. 23. Chriſt giueth power to his Apoſtles to forgiue
ſinnes.
               
                  Anſw. He giueth not them power actually of themſelues or
in their owne name to forgiue: but to declare, to apply in particular,
and to aſſure the conſcience of the penitent beleeuer that
God hath forgiuen him his ſinnes.
               As for other mens Debters,A point of folly to diſcharge other mens debts it is the part of a buſie-bodie to
vndertake the forgiuing of them. Such remiſſion may be an occaſion
of much contention, and thereby a man may bring himſelfe
into needleſſe danger.Pro. 26. 17. 
                  He that paſſeth bie, and medleth with

ſtrife that belongeth not to him, is like one that taketh a dogge by
the eares. What getteth ſuch an one but a ſnap for his paines:
Well therefore doth the Wiſe-man brand him for a foole that
medleth,
                  Prou. 20. 3. namely with other mens matters.
               It is further a note of hypocriſie for a man to bee forward,A note of hypocriſie to ſtir vp others to forgiue what they themſelues forgiue not.
and earneſt in preſſing other men to forgiue their debters, and
yet is himſelfe hard-hearted to his owne debters. They are in
ſome reſpects like to thoſe notorious hypocrites, that laid ſuch
burdens on other mens ſhoulders, as they themſelues would not moue
with one of their fingers.
                  Math. 23. 4. The hard-heartedneſſe of theſe men to
their owne debters is ſo much the more offenſiue, and inexcuſable,
by how much the more earneſt they are with others to
forgiue.Rom. 2. 21, 22, &amp;c. The Apoſtles ſeuere exprobration againſt ſuch as did
not themſelues practiſe that which they taught others, may fitly
be applyed to theſe hypocrites.
               
                  The laſt point obſeruable in the condition annexed to the Fift
Petition is the note of Reſemblance, As, which remaineth
to be handled.
               
            
            
               §. 145. Of the force of this Particle As in the
condition annexed to the fift Petition.
               
                  Q. VVHat doth this Particle, As, import, whereby the
condition is limited to the Petition?
               
                  A. A reſemblance betwixt Gods dealing with vs, and our
dealing with others. This reſemblance conſiſteth not in equality,
quantity, or meaſure; but in equity, quality and manner: that as
God according to his ſurpaſſing greatneſſe is mercifull, ſo wee
according to our poore and meane ability ſhould alſo be mercifull,
though not in ſuch a degree, yet in ſuch truth, and that
freely and fully, as God forgiueth,
               This note of reſemblance therefore,Difference betwixt the reſemblances in the third and fift Petitions. is not here vſed as it was
in the third Petition. For
               1. There that from whence the reſemblance is taken is more
eminent. Here much meaner. It is there taken from thoſe that
are in heauen. But here from vs on earth.
               2. There it noteth a patterne for doing. Here, an euidence
of doing.
               3. There it is vſed for direction, to ſhew what wee ſhould

doe. Here for imitation, to declare what we endeuour to doe.
               
                  Q. Doth not the manner of ſetting downe this reſemblance by
way of condition, import that our forgiuing goeth before Gods?
               
                  A. No. For it hath relation to our aſſurance of Gods forgiuing
vs, not to the act of forgiuing, as it is in God himſelfe: as
if more amply we ſhould ſay, Lord, by that readineſſe which thy
Spirit hath wrought in vs to forgiue our debters, wee haue an euidence
of thy readineſſe to forgiue vs, in faith therefore we craue forgiueneſſe
of thee. After this manner reaſoneth the Apoſtle in
theſe words,1. Ioh. 4. 13. 
                  Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and hee in vs,
becauſe he hath giuen vs of hit Spirit.
               
               To forgiue our brother is a fruit of brotherly loue. Brotherly
loue ſprouteth from our loue of God.1. Ioh. 4. 19. But wee loue God, becauſe
he loued vs firſt. Gods loue therefore goeth before our
loue. And God forgiueth vs, before wee forgiue our brother.
But as the life of a tree which cauſeth the fruit thereof, is diſcerned
by the fruit, ſo Gods loue in forgiuing vs, which cauſeth
vs to forgiue our brother, is by our forgiuing of our brother diſcerned,
and thereby alſo we come to haue aſſurance thereof.
               
                  Obiect. Saint Luke ſetteth downe this clauſe, with a cauſall
Particle,Luke 11. 4. thus, For we alſo forgiue, &amp;c. whereby he implyeth
that our forgiuing one another is a cauſe that moueth God to
forgiue vs.
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . And if it be a cauſe it muſt needs goe before. For the
cauſe is before the effect, at leaſt, in order of nature.
               
                  Anſw. That Particle FOR doth not alwayes note the cauſe,
but many times the effect, eſpecially when the effect is a ſigne
and euidence of the cauſe.Luk. 7. 47. As, where Chriſt ſaid of that deepely
penitent women, Her ſinnes which are many are forgiuen, for
ſhe loued much. That her loue is there noted as an effect of Gods
forgiuing her is euident by the queſtion going before,Luk. 7. 41, 42, 43 and the
anſwer made thereto. The queſtion was this, A Creditor had
two debters: the one owed fiue hundred pence, and the other fifty:
And when they had nothing to pay, he frankely forgaue them both.
Tell me, which of them will loue him moſt? The anſwer was this,
He to whom he forgaue moſt. Is not loue in this queſtion and anſwer,
expreſſely noted to be the effect of forgiueneſſe? In the
ſame ſence, reſpect and relation is loue, vſed in this application
of that Parable, Her ſinnes which are many are forgiuen, for ſhe

loued much: Her much loue declareth that many ſinnes are
forgiuen her. Thus is this Particle FOR ordinarily vſed as a note
of the effect or ſigne in our common ſpeech: As when we ſay,
There is fire, for I ſee ſmoake. This tree hath life, for it ſprouteth.
The Sunne is riſen, for behold ſunſhine.
               
            
            
               §. 146. Of true and vnfained forgiuing one another.
               
                  Q. WHat doctrines doth the reſemblance betwixt Gods forgiuing
and ours import?
               
                  A. 1 We muſt in truth forgiue one another. Thus doth God:
thus may we forgiue. Thus, as we may, muſt wee bee like vnto
God, and forgiue, as he forgiueth. If we doe not ſo, we lye in
ſaying, Forgiue vs As we forgiue. Wee are expreſſely charged,

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   
                  not to loue in word, or in tongue, but in deed, and truth. But
more particularly for this purpoſe,Mat. 18 35. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   Chriſt expreſſely noteth
that forgiueneſſe muſt be from the hearts of men.
               
                  Of the benefit of truth, ſee The whole Armour of God, in Epheſ. 6. 14. Treat. 2. part. 3. §. 9. Truth is a kinde of perfection in this and all other duties:
the beſt and greateſt perfection that in this world wee can attaine
vnto. It ſeaſoneth and ſweetneth that little that we are
able to doe, and maketh it acceptable to God: without this ſeaſon
and fauour of truth all the ſhew of forgiueneſſe which we
make, is odious and deteſtable vnto God: neither can it bring
any comfort to our owne ſoules.Dimittite vbi Deus videt. Ali quando enim homo dimittit ore, &amp; tenet in corde: dimittit ore propter homines, &amp; tenet in corde. Non times oculos Dei? Aug. Hom. 42. in l. 50. Hom. God is a ſearcher of the heart.
He that would haue his forgiueneſſe acceptable to God, muſt
from the heart forgiue.Diſcouetie of counterfeit forgiueneſſe. 1. When it is mixed with deſire of reuenge. He that forgiueth with his tongue that
which hee retaineth in his heart, forgiueth for mans ſake, but
reſpecteth not God.
               How many be there, whoſe forgiueneſſe if it be tryed by this
Touch-ſtone of truth, will be found to bee plaine counterfeit,
and ſo nothing worth? Counterfeit forgiueneſſe is farre vnlike
Gods. It cannot be pleaded in prayer: nor can it giue aſſurance
of Gods forgiuing vs. Yet the forgiueneſſe of moſt is no better.
               Some thinke they doe very well, if they forbeare to take outward
reuenge, though they retaine an inward grudge, and ſecret
hatred. This may be ſomething to man, who knoweth not
the thoughts of the heart: but to God, the ſearcher of hearts, it
is as nothing. And if as nothing to him, to whom (if to any) it

is pleaded in prayer,Sunt aliqui ſic donantes iniuriam, vt non vlciſcantur, ſapius tamen improperent. Sunt &amp; alij, qui, ſileant licet, manet tamen alta mente repoſta, &amp; rancorem tenent in animo: quorum vtique neutra plena indulgentia eſt. Bern. de Euang. Sept. pan. Serm. 3 in what ſtead will it ſtand? Surely in no
other ſtead, then to bee as a witneſſe againſt him, at the iudgement
ſeat of God. For when a man outwardly reſtraineth that
which inwardly he retaineth, his outward forbearance ſheweth,
that in his iudgement he diſallowerh that which he keepeth
in his heart. Thus hee is made a witneſſe againſt himſelfe. Is
not his ſecret corruption the more aggrauated hereby? and
ſhall not his condemnation be the more encreaſed?
               Yet greater ſhall their condemnation be, who carie a faire
face, and make ſhew of forgiueneſſe, when they retaine a full
purpoſe of taking reuenge, onely they put it off to ſome opportunitie:
asGen. 27. 41. 
                  Eſau put off the reuenge hee intended againſt his
brother, till the death of their father. This putting off of reuenge
till an opportunitie, ſheweth that it is no ſmall reuenge
which they intend,2. When reuenge is put off to a fitter time. as appeareth by that which Eſau ſaid, then
will I ſlay my Brother: and it implyeth a ſetled reſolution to doe
it, though for a time there bee ſomething that hindereth them.
What is this but ſetled anger, ſetled hatred, ſetled malice? By
theſe circumſtances is the ſinne made much more hainous.
               But what may be thought of them,3. When a ſhew of forgiueneſſe is made a means of reuenge. who make pretence of
forgiuing to be a meanes of taking reuenge: as Ioab did,2. Sam. 3. 27. when
hee tooke Abner aſide to ſpeake with him quietly, and ſmote him
vnder the fift rib: and2. Sam. 20. 9, 10. when he tooke Amaſa by the beard to
kiſſe him, and ſhed out his bowels. And as2. Sam. 13. 26, 28. 
                  Abſolon did, who inuited
Amnon to a Feaſt where he cauſed him to be ſlaine. If ſuch
ſhould vſe this Petition, they would thereby make a fearfull
imprecation againſt their owne ſoules. A meere ſhew of forgiueneſſe
without truth, doth make God to take the greater
reuenge of them. Let men therefore forgiue in truth, as God
doth, or not ſeeme to forgiue at all.
            
            
               §. 147. Of forgiuing one another freely.
               
                  Q. VVHat other doctrine doth the reſemblance betwixt
Gods forgiuing, and ours, import?
               
                  A. We muſt freely forgiue one another. The
word forgiue applyed to God, implyeth as much. We therefore
profeſſing to forgiue As God forgiueth, muſt forgiue freely,
                  
not on bie-reſpects, not as forced, not for outward recompence,
or aduantage to our ſelues, but for the Lords ſake, for loues
ſake, and for his ſake whom we doe forgiue. Where the Apoſtle
before this duty of forgiueneſſe premiſeth kindneſſe and tenderneſſe,
                  Epheſ. 4. 32.
ſaying, Be kinde one to another and tender-hearted, forgiuing
one another, hee giueth vs to vnderſtand that it muſt be
freely done: which is further enforced by the patterne of God
that he ſetteth before vs, in theſe words, Euen as God for Chriſts
ſake forgaue you. That which God doth for Chriſts ſake, he doth
moſt freely. This pattern the Apoſtle himſelfe exactly followed.
For where he maketh mention of his own forgiuing another, he
ſaith,2. Cor. 2. 10. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  I forgaue in the perſon, or in the ſight of Chriſt, that is, freely,
heartily, approuing my ſelfe to Chriſt therein, in whoſe preſence
I ſtood.
               A kindneſſe freely done is a double kindneſſe. Much more
acceptable to God,2, Cor. 9. 7. who loueth him that doth what hee doth
cheerefully and willingly: and much more gratefull to him, to
whom it is done.Prou. 22, 9. 
                  He that hath a good eye, and thereby manifeſteth willingneſſe, and cheerefulneſſe in that good which hee
doth,Prou. 23. 6, 8. 
                  ſhall be bleſſed. But a man of an euill eye, maketh the
good which he doth to be vomited vp.
               
               That in this particular we may indeed doe as we profeſſe to
doe,Motiues freely to forgiue one another. that is, freely forgiue others, as God doth freely forgiue vs,
let vs duely weigh the excellency of the patterne here ſet before
vs, the great difference betwixt a free and forced kindneſſe,
the glory of this kinde of forgiuing (the more free it is the more
diuine it is) the great need wherein wee ſtand of a free forgiueneſſe
(did not God freely forgiue vs, we could looke for no forgiueneſſe
at all) and the great benefit that thereby redoundeth
to vs: for that which is freely done bringeth much comfort to
the ſoule of him that doth it, makes other men the more to
commend it, and moues God the more graciouſly to accept it,
and the more aboundantly to reward,Offer forgiueneſſe. and recompence it.
               To ſhew how ready we are freely for the Lords ſake, for conſcience
ſake,
                  Seeke reconciliation. 
                  not on bie-reſpects, to forgiue, hauing to doe with
ſuch wrong doers as are ſtout, and will not aske forgiueneſſe
nor ſeek reconciliation, we, euen we that haue receiued wrong,
muſt offer it, asGal. 4. 12, &amp;c Saint Paul did to the Galatians: and1. Sa 24. 9, &amp;c.—26. 18, &amp;c. 
                  Dauid
                  
to Saul. The phraſes of1, Pet. 3. 11. 
                  ſeeking andHeb. 12. 14. 
                  purſuing peace, imply as
much. We ſeeke things that are not offered to vs: and we purſue
things that fly from vs. The Apoſtle preſſeth this duty on vs
to the very vttermoſt of our endeuour.Rom. 12. 18. 
                  If it be poſſible, ſaith
he: as much as in you lyeth liue peaceably with all men.
                  2. Cor. 5. 20. God offers
reconciliation to vs, and beſeecheth vs by his Miniſters to
be reconciled to him. If therefore we will be followers of God,
and forgiue as God forgiueth, Wee muſt not alwayes ſtay till
he who hath done the wrong commeth &amp; asketh forgiueneſſe:
thus may we meet with ſuch as we ſhall neuer forgiue, and ſo
depriue our ſelues of the glory of this worke of mercy
            
            
               §. 148. Of a full forgiuing one another.
               Q. WHat third doctrine doth the reſemblance betwixt Gods
forgiuing, and ours import?
               
                  A. Wrongs muſt be ſo paſſed ouer as if they had not been done. This
is a full forgiueneſſe, anſwerable to Gods: who ſo fully acquitteth
vs of our ſinnes as if we had committed to ſinne at all. Our
forgiueneſſe therefore, by vertue of the foreſaid reſemblance
muſt extend it ſelfe not to ſome part onely, but to the whole
debt or wrong, and that with ſuch a minde, as if no debt had
been due, no wrong done. Where the Apoſtle, to them, that by
ſtarting from the Goſpell which he had taught, had exceedingly
wronged his Miniſtery,Gal▪ 4. 12. ſaith, Brethren, I beſeech you, bee as I
am, for I am as ye are, ye haue not iniured me at all, doth he not
fully forgiue the wrong, euen ſo fully, as if at all they had not
wronged him. Thus much doth the ſame Apoſtle require of
Philemon,
                  Philem. ver. 6. in regard of the wrong which his ſeruant Oneſimus
had done him.Gen. 50. 17, 21. So did Ioſeph and Moſes paſſe ouer the offences
of their brethren.Numb. 12. 13. They did ſo accept and eſteeme them, as if
they had done no wrong at all.
               Q. What if by the wrong a man doth me, I obſerue ſuch infirmitie,
yea and iniquitie to be in him,Direction for cariage of our ſelues to wrongdoets. as by experience I finde him to bee
a farre other man then at firſt I ſuppoſed him to bee, ought I notwithſtanding
to make ſuch account of him as I did before?
               
                  A. Wee muſt put difference betwixt a wrong done vpon
ſuch an occaſion as may afterwards be auoided, and that which

is done vpon an euill diſpoſition, which remaining in a man,
may be a meanes to make him continue to doe more and more
wrongs. The wrong of the former muſt be ſo forgiuen, as the
wrong doer be ſo accepted as if he had done no wrong at all.
As for the latter, we are to try if he may be brought to ſight
of his euill diſpoſition, and to repentance for the ſame. If he be,
then ought we to eſteeme him as if hee neuer had done vs any
hurt. But if obſtinately he perſiſt in that euill diſpoſition, and
be like, on all occaſions, againe and againe to wrong vs, though
we doe, as we ought, fully forgiue all the wrongs done, and
neither take any preſent reuenge, nor keepe them in mind and
memory for any future reuenge, yet may we in our iudgement
eſteeme him to be ſuch an one as wee finde him to be.Iſa. 5. 20. (Woe to
them that call euil good: that put light for darkneſſe, and ſweet
for bitter.) For example, if I finde one of whom I haue had a
very good account, and thereupon vſed him very familiarly,
to haue no command of his tongue, but on all occaſions to be
ready to blab out, and blaze abroad whatſoeuer hee ſeeth or
heareth, if therein hee haue wronged mee, I may forbeare
to vſe him ſo familiarly as I did before, and take heed
what ſecrets I communicate to him, though I fully forgiue
the wrong that is paſt. Or if I haue accounted one to be an
intire friend to mee, but by experience finde him to bee hollow-hearted,
and maliciouſly minded againſt mee, I ought
wiſely and warily to auoid his ſocietie, and to take heed of the
ſnares which he layeth for me.1. Sam. 19. 20. (For which wee haue the patterne
of Dauid,
                  Ioh. 2. 24. and Chriſt) yet ſo to paſſe by the wrongs done
as if none had been done.
               For attaining to this degree of forgiueneſſe,Direction for manifeſtation of forgiueneſſe that our forgiuing
may be, as Gods, full.
               
               1. Reuenge muſt be purged out of the heart. The heart
is the fountaine. If that bee cleanſed the ſtreames will bee
cleare.
               2. Wrong muſt bee put out of minde and memory ſo
farre as poſſibly can be. Things forgotten are as things not
done.
               3. No needfull kindneſſe muſt bee denied to him that hath
wronged vs.
               
                  
4. Occaſions of doing good to wrong doers muſt not onely
bee taken, but ſought. Readineſſe and willingneſſe to doe
all offices of courteſie and charitie to ſuch as are ready to
doe all the miſchiefe and iniurie that they can vnto vs, ſheweth
that no reuenge lurketh in our hearts. Continuall fruits
of loue cannot iſſue out of a reuengefull heart.
               The ſeuerall points of the condition annexed to the fift Petition
hauing been diſtinctly handled, for better clearing thereof,
ſundry queſtions about proper debts, ſutes in Law, and
execution of Iuſtice are to be reſolued.
            
            
               §. 149. Of requiring proper Debts.
               
                  Q. MAy a Chriſtian require debts of money or other like
things due to him?
               
                  A. He may. For
               1. The Law of God giueth liberty to a Creditor to take a
pledge of the Debter for ſecuritie of paying the debt:Deut. 24. 10, 11, 12. in caſe
the debter be not very poore, and the Pledge ſuch an one as he
cannot ſpare.
               2. Debters are commanded to pay their debts:Rom. 13. 7, 8. Creditors
therefore may take them.
               3. God did extraordinarily prouide for a poore widdow
wherewithall ſhe might pay her debt.2. King. 4. 7. Had it beene vnlawfull
for a Creditor to require his debt, God would rather haue
prouided meanes to reſtraine him from exacting the debt, then
for her to pay the debt.
               
                  Q. How can requiring debts, and forgiuing debters ſtand together?
               
                  A. 1. Forgiueneſſe here profeſſed hath reſpect rather to
wrongs done, then to commodities due. The word, Debters,
is metaphorically by way of reſemblance vſed. For hee that
doth wrong, maketh himſelfe, as a debter, bound to ſome
penaltie for the wrong hee hath done. Saint Mathew in his
expoſition of this condition vſeth a word which in relation to
man,Mat. 16. 14, 15. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . ſignifieth offences, wrongs, or iniuries.
               
               2. It reſtraineth all reuenge in exacting due debts. Whatſoeuer
wrong wee conceiue to be done vs by not paying the

debt muſt ſo farre be forborne, as we take no reuenge thereof.
We may not hate, reuile, or euilly entreat our debters for not
paying their debts.
               3. It keepeth our exacting of debts within the compaſſe of
mercie. Which is, that in caſe the debter be no way able to
pay the debt, we rather forgiue it, then by hard and cruell
meanes vtterly vndoe him, as by laying executions vpon all he
hath, or keeping him vnder perpetuall impriſonment.
               
                  Obiect.
                  Luke 6. 35. It is Chriſts expreſſe charge to lend hoping for nothing
againe. How then may a debt be required, if it may not be looked
for againe?
               
                  A. 1. That, as other like precepts in Chriſts Sermon on the
Mount, is not ſimply, but comparatiuely to be taken: that we ſhold
be ſo farre from the cruell Vſurers mind, who is reſolued to
haue both principall and intereſt, or, rather then faile of either,
to do what he can in ſtricteſt rigour of Law againſt principall
and ſuretie, we ſhould I ſay be ſo farre from ſuch a mind, as not
to looke for any thing, no not for the principall againe.
               2. That precept is laid downe as a rule of loue: and according
to the rule of loue to be taken. Now loue requireth mercie
to be ſhewed to him that needeth. The rule of loue is, on the
one ſide, my brothers neceſſitie, and on the other, mine owne abilitie:
                  1. Iohn. 3. 17.
which the Apoſtle implyeth in this inſtance, Who ſo hath
this worlds goods (there is a mans abilitie,) and ſeeth his brother
hath need (here is his brothers neceſſitie.) On this ground when
a man lendeth, he muſt be ſo mercifully minded, as, if his debter
fall into extreme pouertie, and be not able to pay what hee
hath borrowed, willingly to remit the whole debt, and in ſuch
a caſe not ſo much as to looke for any thing againe.
               3. Some reſtraine that generall particle nothing to intereſt and
ouerplus,Sentit, opinor, de f
                        •
                     nore quod ex mutu
                        •
                      redit. Nam in hunc ſenſum interpretantur veteres. Eraſm in Luc. 6. 35. as if he had ſaid, Lend, hoping for nothing aboue the principall;
or for nothing by way of intereſt. In this ſence it maketh
not againſt the forenamed poſition of requiring a mans due
debt:See D. Downam on the 15. Pſal. intereſt being no due debt, but forbidden by Gods word.
            
            
               
               §. 150. Of going to Law.
               
                  Q. MAy a Chriſtian by Law exact his due debt, in caſe his
debter be able, but wilfull, and refuſe to pay it?
               A. Yea, he may. For publicke Magiſtrates and
Iudges who haue power to determine caſes in Law,Rom. 13. 1. 
                  are of God.
God hath appointed them, to force ſuch as are wilfull and obſtinate
to do that which is iuſt and right, and to giue to euerie
one his owne: yea and commanded his people in matters of
controuerſie to ſtand to the determination of the Iudge.Deut. 17. 8. 9, 10, 11.
               
               
                  Obiect. S. Paul blameth the Corinthians for going to law one
with another.1. Cor. 6. 1.
               
               
                  Anſw. Going to law is not there ſimply blamed and forbidden,
but ſundry abuſes thereof. As,
               1. Going to vnfit Iudges (whom the Apoſtle ſtileth vniuſt,
                  Ver. 1, 6. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Ver. 2. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Ver. 5.
and vnbeleeuers) and bringing Chriſtians before them.
               2. Contending about ſmall matters, and meere trifles: euen
about words, and light damages.
               3. Too much forwardneſſe to Law. When Law is the firſt
remedie that is vſed for getting that which a man conceiues to
be his right. Many are ſo forward, that ſecretely without any
notice giuen to the partie ſued, they will ſteale a iudgement.
               4. Doing wrong themſelues.Ver. 8. Euen they who went to Law
were wrong doers, as the Apoſtle ſaith, you do wrong. Many
which do wrong to others, complaine, and commence ſuite in
Law againſt thoſe to whom they do the wrong, to colour the
wrong which themſelues do, and to get aduantage for doing
the greater miſchiefe,
               
                  Q. In what caſes may Chriſtians go to Law?
               
                  A. 1.Deut. 17. 8. In matters of moment: which are too hard for priuate
Chriſtians to decide.
               2. When we haue to do with wilfull perſons, who will be
brought to nothing, but what they are forced vnto. Saint Paul
hauing to do with ſuch,Acts 25. 11. was forced to appeale to Caeſar.
               
               3. After all priuate meanes that we can thinke of haue bene
vſed. So as Law muſt be vſed in the laſt place, as the laſt remedie.

After one hath admoniſhed a brother ſecretly, yea and taken
the helpe of ſome few friends,Math. 18. 15, 16, 17. and yet he remaineth obſtinate,
Chriſt aduiſeth to tell ſuch as are in autoritie.
               Prouided that all ſuites in Law be made in loue.1. Cor. 16. 14. 
                  Let all your
things be done in charitie. Many are of opinion that no man can
go to Law in charitie. But they are groſly deceiued. For,
               1. He that iuſtly and rightly goeth to Law at leaſt ſuppoſeth
that he hath right on his ſide, and that the partie whom hee
ſueth doeth wrong in that for which he is ſued. Now to bring
a wrong-doer to do right, is a dutie, and fruite of loue.
               2. Suing in Law hath reſpect onely to that particular thing
which is in queſtion. But charitie extends it ſelfe to all things
wherein one may be profitable to another. The man that in one
particular ſeeketh to haue from another that which of right
belongeth to himſelfe, may in all other things be readie to do
what good he can to that other.
               3 The manner of proſecuting a ſute of Law may be, as with

and ſo that very particular be done in loue.
               4. In a doubtfull caſe queſtioned in Law a man may bee ſo
willing to ſtand to the ſentence of Law, as to bee content either
way, whether it goe with him, or againſt him. Yea if it appeare
that right be on his aduerſaries ſide, to bee glad that the Law
hath diſcouered right euen againſt himſelfe. Doth not this
ſhew much loue? Wherefore though by the Apoſtles prohibition
we are taught,1. Cor. 6. 1. &amp;c. as much as may be, to forbeare Law, to
ſuffer ſome loſſe, to beare with ſome wrong, and in ſome things
to part with our right, yet on the forenamed grounds, and
with the forenamed prouiſo, it is both lawfull and expedient
to ſeeke the helpe of Law: the ends whereof are very good,
as, To defend the innocent, to releeue the oppreſſed, to puniſh the
euill doers, to decide doubts, to determine rights, and to giue euerie
one their owne.

                  Q. MAy wrong done to a man be puniſhed?
               
                  A. Yea, by ſuch as haue authoritie. The Lord
hath giuen to Magiſtrates, and ſuch as are in authoritie, the power
which of right belongeth to them for this end,Rom. 13 4. Deut. 25. 1, 2. 
                  To puniſh
euill doers.
                  1. King. 2. 31, 46. They that haue ſo done haue bene commended for
it.1. Sam. 3. 13. They who haue beene negligent therein haue themſelues
beene puniſhed of God. He to whom the wrong is done may
forgiue the wrong done, and yet the Magiſtrate puniſh him.
               
                  Q. May Magiſtrates puniſh wrong done to themſelues?
               
                  A. Yea alſo. For the office of a Magiſtrate may be diſtinguiſhed
from his perſon. The wrong is done to his perſon, the
puniſhment is taken by vertue of his place and office. The
wrong for which Salomon commanded Adonijah to be ſlaine,
and Abiathaer to be remoued from the Prieſthood was againſt
himſelfe:Compare 1. King. 17. &amp;c with King. 2. 24, 26, 31. and the particular occaſion which he tooke of putting
Ioab to death, was conſpiracie with Ado

                  Q. How then are Magiſtrates tied to forgiue their debters?
               
                  A. By being reſtrained from priuate reuenge. In which
reſpect Dauid bleſſeth God for keeping him from reuenging himſelfe
with his owne hand.
                  1. Sam. 25. 33. We muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt publicke
iuſtice, and priuate reuenge. 1.Deut. 17. 9. That ariſeth from iudgement:
Gen. 4. 5. this from wrath. 2.2. Cor. 4. 2. That is accompanied with loue:Gen. 27. 41. this
with hatred. 3.Rom. 13. 4. That is done in Gods name: this is a mans
owne. All priuate reuenge, though no outward hurt, or wrong
be done thereby, is a ſinne in the reuenging partie becauſe of
the inward corruption whence it ariſeth. Much hurt may fall
on a delinquent by publicke Iuſtice, and yet no ſinne in the execution
thereof, becauſe it may ſtand with equitie, pitty, mercy,
and charity: and it may aime at the good of the partie puniſhed:
yea and turne to his good alſo. A malefactor may be
accuſed, condemned, and puniſhed with ſtripes, fine, impriſonment,
baniſhment, excommunication, death, or otherwiſe,
and yet the bonds of mercie and loue not tranſgreſſed. Thus
may ſuites of law be made, and willfull or negligent debters

caſt into priſon, as theſe are parts of publicke iuſtice, and yet
the condition of the fift Petition not be violated, if anger, hatred,
malice, reuenge and ſuch like corruptions taint not the
foreſaid execution of Iuſtice.
               The diſtinct points of the forenamed Condition hauing beene all
handled, The maine ſcope and iuſt conſequence thereof is
further to be conſidered.
            
            
               §. 152. Of imitating God in forgiuing
wrongs.
               
                  Q. VVHy is the Condition annexed to the fift petition?
               
                  A. 1.Exemplo ineffabilis miſericordiae Dei, nos etiam ad dandam peccantibus in nos veniam cohortatur. Chryſ. Hom 20. in Mat. 6. Math. 6. 14, 15. To moue vs to forgiue one another.
               2. To giue vs aſſurance of Gods forgiuing vs.
               A ſtrong motiue it muſt needs be, in that all the euidence
that we can haue of Gods mercie in forgiuing vs, ariſeth from
our readie mind and forward diſpoſition to forgiue others. If
we forgiue men, God will forgiue vs. If we forgiue not men,
God will not forgiue vs. Our Lord therefore enioyneth vs to
make this profeſſion, As we forgiue, that we knowing and beleeuing
Gods indulgencie and readineſſe to forgiue vs, might
be moued to do the like for others; and might not dare to approach
to the mercie Seat of God to craue pardon of him, vnleſſe
our conſcience can and doe beare witneſſe for vs, that
we are on all occaſions ready to grant pardon to ſuch as
wrong vs.
               
                  Q. What doctrine doth the firſt end of the condition added to the
fift Petition afford?
               A. Gods mercie to man is a forceable motiue for man to ſhew
mercie to man.Gods patterne a weightie motiue. 
                  Therefore Gods practiſe is oft ſet as a patterne
before men.
                  Lege Chryſ. loco citato. Forgiue one another as God hath forgiuen you. Be mercifull,
as your Father is mercifull. Walke in loue, as Chriſt hath loued
vs.Eph. 4. 32. Be followers of God.Luke 6. 36. Be perfect,Eph. 5. 1, 2. as your Father in heauen is perfect.Mat. 5. 48.
               
               Two eſpeciall things there be in Gods patterne which are of
great force to moue vs to imitate him.
               1. That infinite difference which is betwixt him and vs.
               2. That infinite debt wherein we ſtand bound to his iuſtice.
               
                  
Such is the ſurpaſſing excellencie of God,Infinite difference betwixt God and man. ſuch the brightneſſe
of his Maieſtie, ſuch the abſolute ſupremacie of his Soueraigntie,
ſuch the omnipotencie of his power, ſuch his all-ſufficiencie,
as man compared to God isGen. 18. 27.

                  All nations before him are as nothing,
and they are counted to him leſſe then nothing. What man is,
he is of God. God is our Creator, we the worke of his hands.
He our Soueraigne,Equalitie betwixt man and man. we his ſubiects. Betwixt man and man
there is no ſuch difference. All, in relation to God the high
Lord, are fellow ſeruants. Though in a mutuall relation one to
another there be ſome differences, as betwixt Magiſtrates and
Subiects, Maiſters and Seruants, Parents and Children, yet are
thoſe differences but externall, and temporall. Externall, in the
affaires of this world, for outward order and gouernement.
(Gal. 3. 28. 
                  In Ieſus Chriſt all are one) Temporall, for the time of this world.
(After this lifeIob 3. 19. 
                  the ſeruant is free from his Maiſter.
                  Mat. 22. 30. All are as
Angels,) yea all children of Adam, as in the points of their
humiliation they are from the ſame mould, of the ſame corrupt
nature, ſubiect to the ſame infirmities, at length brought to the
ſame end, ſo in the points of their exaltation, they are all (I

by the ſame price, partakers of the ſame grace, and
heires of the ſame inheritance. If then God, the Creator of all,
and Supreme Lord ouer all, who ſtandeth in no need of any
thing that man can do, nor can reape any benefit from man,
who neuer wronged any, nor needeth forgiueneſſe, if God forgiue
man,Ille qui nihil nos laeſit, non vult ſe vindicare de nobis: &amp; nos quarimus vindicari qui penè quotidie deum offendimus? Aug. Hom. 42. in l. 50. Hom. ſhall not man forgiue man, one creature another,
one fellow-ſeruant another, man who needeth mans helpe, and
may reape much good by mutuall agreement and reconciliation
with man, who oft wrongeth another, and needeth to be forgiuen
of others, ſhall not man forgiue man, man that daily
ſinneth againſt God? As the difference betwixt God in relation
to man, and man in relation to other men is beyond compariſon:
ſo alſo is the debt which man oweth to God, and that
which one man oweth to another.Mat. 18. 24, 28. In the Parable the debt due
to the Lord is ſaid to be ten thouſand Talents: and the debt due
to the ſeruant, an hundred pence. Amongſt men ſome difference

there is betwixt Talents and Pence:
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Cyril. Catech. myſt. 5. and betwixt tenne thouſand,
and one hundred: ſo that, as in a Parable, that ſetteth out a great
difference betwixt the debt wherein we ſtand bound to God,
and that which one man oweth to another. And this difference
doth much enforce the motiue taken from Gods example. If
God forgiue Talents, ſhall not we forgiue Pence? If God forgiue
ten thouſand, ſhall not we forgiue one hundred? But this difference
is onely in a Parable. In truth there is infinitly more difference
betwixt the ſins which we commit againſt God, and the wrongs
which one man doth to another, in weight, then betwixt Talents
and Pence: and in number, then betwixt ten thouſand and one hundred.
Our ſinnes for weight are infinite, being committed againſt
an infinite Maieſtie. The penaltie due to them is Gods infinite
wrath, the infinite curſe of the Law, eternall damnation. No
ſuch wrong can poſſibly by done to man. As for the number of
our ſinnes it is innumerable.
                  Pſal. 40. 12. 
                  They are moe then the haires of our
head. No man can do ſo many wrongs to vs as we doe daily
commit ſinnes againſt God. On theſe and other like grounds
might the Lord well ſay to his hard-hearted ſeruant,Mat. 18. 32. 33. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  I forgaue
thee: Shouldeſt not thou alſo haue had compaſſion on thy fellow-ſeruant,
euen as I had pittie on thee? Conſidering the great things
we receiue for ſmall, let vs not be ſlacke to forgiue one another.
                     Cyril. loc. citat. Meditate on Gods patterne.
               
               This patterne of God is duly to be weighed, and oft to be
meditated on. Good patternes and preſidents as they giue
good directions, ſo they are great incitations, and inducements
to ſtirre vs vp to do a thing: eſpecially when they are the examples
of ſuch as we haue iuſt cauſe highly to eſteeme. Now
who is more highly to be eſteemed, then God? what more
worthy patterne can there be? An high honor it is to be like vnto
God, &amp; to do as he doth. Gods example is a perfect patterne:
and in that reſpect to be followed: yea ſo much the rather becauſe
it taketh away all thoſe pretences which men vſe to alledge
for iuſtifying their reuenge, and not forgiuing ſuch as
wrong them.
               Their pretences are ſuch as theſe.Pretences for reuenge anſwered.
               
               1. He that hath wronged me is a baſe fellow.
               
                  A. What more baſe to thee, then thou art to God?
               
                  
2. The wrong done is vnſufferable.
               
                  A. What? more vnſufferable then thy ſinnes againſt
God?
               3. It is not the firſt time that he hath wronged me.
               
                  A. Diddeſt thou neuer but once ſinne againſt God?
               4. He may wrong me againe and againe if I put it vp?
               
                  A. Why doeſt thou thinke ſo vncharitably of thy brother?
But maiſt thou not ſinne againe and againe againſt God?
               5. It beſeemeth not my place and honour to put vp wrongs.Quid aduerſus cum tantopere iracundia efferueſcis, ſi quis negligentior, &amp;c. quum te ipſum inſpicere oporteat qualis tu aduerſus Dominum fueris. Greg. Nyſſ. lib. de Orat.
               
               
                  A. Is thy place and honour greater then Gods?
               6. I ſhall be counted a Coward if I reuenge not wrongs.
               
                  A. Is God ſo accounted for bearing with ſinnes?
               If God do thus, why art thou ſo much incenſed with wrath,
when any doth any wrong to thee? Thou ſhouldeſt rather behold
thy ſelfe, how thou haſt carried thy ſelfe againſt God.
If any thing will make thee forgiue, ſurely this will.

praying for reuenge.
               
                  Q. VVHat other doctrine doth the ſaid end of the condition
added to the Fift Petition import?
               
                  A. Prayer may not bee made for pardon, with a reuengefull
minde. For we are bound to make profeſſion of forgiuing our
debters, ſo oft as we pray for pardon of our ſinnes. The charge
of lifting vp pure hands without wrath tendeth to this purpoſe.1. Tim. 2. 8.
So doth alſo the charge of leauing the gift before the Altar, and
being firſt reconciled,
                  Math. 5. 23, 24. 
                  if we remember that our brother hath ought
againſt vs.
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Act. 24. 20. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . This phraſe, hath ought againſt thee, is a Law
terme, and implyeth a ſute in Law, or a difference. So is it vſed
by Saint Paul in his Apologie before Felix. They ought to
haue beene heere before thee, and obiect, if they had ought againſt
mee. So as the reconciliation required, is in a variance,
whether we haue done, or receiued wrong. Satisfaction muſt
be made for the wrong which a man doth. Remiſſion muſt be
granted to the wrong which is done to a man. He that refuſeth
to doe the one or the other, if he ſay the Lords Prayer,
maketh a fearfull imprecation againſt himſelfe, as wee ſhall

                  Anſw. A double ſin would ſo be committed. One by omitting
a bounden dutie. The other by perſiſting in an hatefull ſin.
The onely warrantable and comfortable courſe in that caſe, is
to ſubdue paſſion, to caſt off deſire of Reuenge. Breach of charitie,
giueth no diſpenſation for neglect of piety. Chriſts charge
is this,

bee well noted of ſuch as forbeare to come to the Lords Table
becauſe they are not in Charitie. An vnchriſtian practiſe.
               On this ground, as at all times, ſo eſpecially when we draw
neare to the Throne of Grace, wee ought to keepe a narrow
watch, that anger, wrath, enuie, malice, reuenge enter not into
vs. Yea then eſpecially we ought thorowly to ſift, ſearch, and
examine our ſelues, whether thoſe or any other like euill qualities
haue been bred in vs, or haue entred into vs, and ſtill remaine
lurking in vs. Firſt purge them out before thou

to fall vpon others? Surely their prayers are odious in
Gods ſight, and thereby they pull vengeance on their owne
pates: which they doe much more, that by Prayer, Vow, and
Sacrament binde themſelues to doe miſchiefe, and take reuenge,
yea &amp; that vpon their Soueraigne, and Kingdome where
they liue: as Ieſuites, and other Papiſts oft doe. It is probable
thatLuk. 13. 1. they whoſe bloud Pilate mingled with their ſacrifices, ſo
did: and that that kinde of puniſhment as a iuſt recompence
was by the diuine prouidence inflicted on them.Pſal. 109. 17. 1

               §. 154. Of the aſſurance which our forgiuing
giueth of Gods forgiuing vs.

                  The firſt end was A motiue to forgiue. §. 152. VVHat doctrine doth the other end of the condition
annexed to the fift Petition afford?
               
                  A. Mans forgiuing his Brother giueth aſſurance
of Gods forgiuing him. This is one maine end of adding
this condition of our forgiuing our brother, to our deſire of
Gods forgiuing vs: as is euident by that cauſall Particle, FOR,
which Saint Luke ſetteth before it,Luke 11. 4. thus, For wee alſo forgiue.
The reference which Chriſt maketh immediately after this
prayer doth make the point moſt cleare.Math. 6. 14. His inference is this,
If yee forgiue men their treſpaſſes, your heauenly Father will alſo
forgiue you. Doth he not thereby imply that by forgiuing men,
we gaine aſſurance of Gods forgiuing vs? On this ground did
Nehemiah in his prayer to God plead the kindneſſe which hee
had ſhewed to the people of God.
                  Neh. 5. 19. &amp; 13, 14, 22.
               
               
                  Obiect. Many Heathen, and other meere carnall men, who
could haue no aſſurance of the forgiueneſſe of their ſinnes, haue
forgiuen many wrongs done to them.
               
                  Anſw.
                  Carnall mens forgiuing is on bie reſpects. Their forgiuing is no true forgiuing, becauſe it ariſeth
from bie-reſpects to themſelues, and not from his brotherly
loue: much leſſe from conſcience and due reſpect to God.
For if their kinde of forgiuing bee duely weighed it will bee
found to be
               1. Either in ſome ſleight matters which doe not much prouoke
wrath, nor greatly need forgiueneſſe.
               2. Or to ſome friend, kinſman, or ſuch like perſon, whom
in ſome outward reſpect they like and loue.Math. 5. 47.
               
               3.Act. 24. 27. Or for hope of ſome recompence, and aduantage to themſelues.

ſhould manifeſt any thought of reuenge.
               5. Or it may be, by reaſon of an heauy and dull diſpoſition,
which maketh them vnſenſible of wrongs: like him that

is brought in thus ſpeaking,Pro. 23. 35. 
                  They haue ſtricken me, and I was not
ſicke: they haue beaten me, and I felt it not.
               
               True Chriſtian forgiuing,Iam. 3. 17. is a part or branch of that wiſedome
which commeth from aboue, a fruit of that ſpirit that reſideth in
Chriſt,I
                        •
                     eſt nobis quaſi a natura, magis autem ab extermineo naturae, affectio quaedam peſſima, libids nocendi, vt inextinguibilis inueniatur in miſeris animabus noſtris malitiae delectatio. Bern. in Quadr. Serm. 6. an effect of Gods forgiuing vs. For ſonnes of men are by
nature wrathfull and reuengefull. Wrathfull, in that they are
very ſoone vpon euery ſmall and ſleight occaſion prouoked
to wrath, as dry Tinder is ready to be fiered by the leaſt ſparke.
Reuengefull, in that being prouoked, they are as it were on fire
with reuenge: like Gunpowder, which ſo ſoone as it hath taken
any fire is inſtantly all on a flame. The Apoſtle among other
properties of a naturall man reckoneth theſe, maliciouſneſſe,
enuie, debate, malignitie (whereby all things are taken in
an euill part) implacableneſſe, and vnmercifulneſſe. And in another
place to the ſame purpoſe he ſaith, wee are hatefull, and
hating one another.
                  Rom. 1. 29, 30. In regard of this wrathfull and reuengefull
diſpoſition,Tit. 3 3. 
                  men are reſembled to Wolues, Leopards, Beares,
Lyons,

                  Aſpes and Cockatrices. Vnleſſe this nature be altered it
is no more poſſible for a man in true brotherly loue to forgiue,
then for one of the forenamed ſauage creatures to bee quiet,
and doe no hurt, when they are ſtirred vp and prouoked. Nature
muſt be altered before a wrong can be thorowly &amp; rightly
paſſed by and forgiuen. This alteration of nature proceedeth
from an apprehenſion of Gods loue to vs in Chriſt, and that
in pardoning our ſinnes. For the loue of God ſhed abroad in
our hearts by the Holy Ghoſt, is as fire that warmeth our
hearts thaughing out the hard froſt of hatred and reuenge,
and making them plyable to Gods heart and affection to vs,
mercifull as he is mercifull, kinde, gentle and patient as hee is,
forbearing wrongs, and forgiuing debts as hee doth. Hence
then it followeth, that if our diſpoſition be inclinable to forgiue,
and if according to that inclinableneſſe we doe in truth
actually forgiue, we may be aſſured that God hath forgiuen vs:
euen as when we finde a cold thing hot, we may inferre it hath
been heated.
               Learne hereby how to know,
                     Vſes. 1. Tryall of Gods minde to vs. Gods minde towards thee,
Thou needeſt not to climbe vp to heauen there to behold the
face of God whether he frowne or ſmile, whether loue or anger

be ſeated in his eyes, but diue into thine owne heart, and
there obſerue what is thy minde towards thy brother. No looking
Glaſſe can giue a truer repreſentation of thy face, then
thine owne heart a demonſtration of Gods heart towards thee.
Wee loue,
                  1. Ioh 4. 19. 
                  becauſe hee firſt loued vs: and we forgiue becauſe he
firſt forgaue vs.
               Well may we hereby comfort our ſoules in the day of temptation,2. Comfort in time of temptation.
when the conſcience is perplexed with doubting of
pardon. If thou findeſt in thy ſelfe a readineſſe to forgiue thy
brother, thou maiſt conclude that God hath forgiuen thee. To
ſtrengthen thy faith herein duely weigh the infinite diſparity
betwixt Gods goodneſſe and thine. This is as an Ocean that
hath no bottome, no bounds: thine but as a drop. If then thou
for his ſake out of thy drop of goodneſſe canſt afford forgiueneſſe
anſwerable to the wrongs done to thee,Exiguam humanitatem ego exhibui. Non enim amplius capicbat natura. Tua vero munificentia exiguitate potentiae non prohibetur, quin quantum velis tantum largiaris Greg, Nyſſ. lib. de Orat. maiſt thou not
inferre that God out of his bottomeleſſe Ocean will affoord
forgiueneſſe anſwerable to the ſinnes which thou haſt committed
againſt him? When thy conſcience is burdened with the
heauy weight of thy ſinnes, thinke of thy willingneſſe to forgiue
thy brother, and from thence as from a ſigne, or effect, or
euidence learne to quiet thy conſcience, and ſettle thy faith,
and in faith ſay, Forgiue mee as I forgiue: or forgiue mee, for I
forgiue. It is indeed but little mercy that I haue ſhewed: for my
nature was capable of no more. But thy bounty is not hindred by
want of power.
                  3. Motiue to forgiue. 
                  Thou canſt grant as much as thou wilt. Thus may
the heart be enlarged in crauing pardon,Si D
                        •
                     o pro miſericordia atque venia preces oblaturi ſimus, co

               And becauſe this is ſuch an eſpeciall meanes to reſolue thy
ſoule of the pardon of thy ſinnes, bee the rather moued to
ſubdue thy paſſion, when thou art prouoked to caſt out wrath
and readily to forgiue. Seeing it is requiſite that wee offer vp
prayers to God for mercy and pardon, let vs by the teſtimonie
of our conſcience get to our ſelues, that we may make our cariage
an Aduocate to our prayers, and truely ſay, We alſo forgiue
our debters. They who feele the weight of ſinne would
giue all they haue, and doe what poſſibly they could to bee eaſed
thereof. If thou neuer felt'ſt the burden of ſinne on thine
owne ſoule, enquire after ſuch as are wounded in conſcience:

and, becauſe things ſeene are more ſenſible, and make a deeper
impreſſion, got to them, marke their agonies and their outcries;
thereby iudge what an heauy burden ſinne is, when the
ſoule feeles the burden of it. If once thou feeleſt the weight of
it, I make no queſtion, but that, if Chriſt ſhould aske thee, as
once he asked a blind man,Mar. 10. 51. 
                  What wilt thou that I ſhould doe to
thee, thou wouldeſt anſwer, Lord, that I may be eaſed of the burden
of ſinne. Behold here how thou maiſt be eaſed. As any occaſion
is offered, Forgiue. Thus in doing goodneſſe to man, thou
doeſt the beſt and greateſt goodneſſe to thy ſelfe, in that God
(whoſe goodneſſe infinitely ſurpaſſeth thine) is moued thereby
to doe good to thee. This is a great encouragement, a
ground of much comfort to ſuch as can and doe forgiue men.
Though they haue no recompence from man, though they be
laughed at for it: yea though they be worſe dealt withall (as
Pſal. 35. 12.—120. 7. 
                  Dauid was) and more wronged becauſe they are ſo ready to
forgiue, yet Gods gracious acceptation thereof, his mercifull
dealing with them for it, is recompence enough.

                  Q. VVHat doctrine followeth as a iuſt conſequence from the
forenamed condition?
               
                  A.

                     nit. Eccl. §. 11 
                  They who forgiue not men are not forgiuen of God. Bring
that which is here intended by Chriſt into a true, Logicall, Syllogiſticall
forme, and the conſequence will appeare to be moſt
iuſt. The forme is this. Forgiue vs as wee forgiue others. But we
forgiue not others. Therefore forgiue not vs. The propoſition is
expreſſed in the Lords Prayer. The aſſumption is deducted out
of the inward diſpoſition, and outward practiſe of the reuengefull
perſon. The concluſion floweth from the Premiſſes
by iuſt and neceſſarie conſequence. Yet further to confirme this
concluſion, and to ſhew that it is not wreſted, let it bee noted
how Chriſt immediately after this prayer, expreſſely inferreth
as much in theſe words,Mat. 16. 15. 
                  If yee forgiue not men their treſpaſſes,
neither will your Father forgiue you your treſpaſſes. In the Parable
ye finde as much verified. For the Lord deliuered that ſeruant,

that would not forgiue his fellow-ſeruant,Math▪ 18. 34, 35. 
                  to the Tormenters,
till he ſhould pay all that was due to him. Thereupon Chriſt
maketh this Inference, So likewiſe ſhall my heauenly Father doe
alſo vnto you, if yee from your hearts forgiue not euery one his brother
their treſpaſſes.
               
               It is Gods vſuall manner to deale with men according to
their dealing one with another. Theſe prouerbiall ſpeeches import
as much,Math. 7. 1. 
                  With what meaſure you mete it ſhall be meaſured
to you againe.
                  Gal. 6. 7. 
                  Whatſoeuer a man ſoweth that ſhall he reape. Hee
ſhall haue iudgement without mercy that hath ſhewed no mercy.
                  Iam. 2. 
                        •
                     3.
                  Diues,
                  Luk. 16. 21, 24. that denied to Lazarus the crummes that fell from his
Table, was denied a drop of cold water to coole his tongue. For
man is to man in Gods ſtead. By our cariage to man God taketh
tryall of our diſpoſition to him. Whereupon Saint Iohn
ſaith,1. Ioh. 3. 17. 
                  Who ſo hath this worlds goods, and ſeeth his brother
hath need, and ſhutteth vp his bowels of compaſſion from him, how
dwelleth the loue of God in him? For hee that loueth not his
Brother whom hee hath ſeene,
                  —4. 20. 
                  how can he loue God whom he hath
not ſeene?
               
               Gods mercy is operatiue as fire: it warmeth that heart in
which it abideth, and worketh mercy therein. Where therefore
no mercy to man can be found, there is iuſt cauſe to ſuſpect no
mercy of God hath been ſhewed. The ſoule of an vnmercifull
man is no fit receptacle of the mercies of God. It abuſeth, it
peruerteth them.
               Behold here the folly of cruell hard-hearted and reuengefull
perſons,Folly of reuengefull perſons. who like the vnmercifull ſeruant, deny that to
their brother which they craue of God. What can they looke
for of GodMath. 18. 3
                        •
                     . but ſuch meaſure as was meted out to the ſaid ſeruant,
and toLuk. 16, 24. 25. 
                  Diues? They therefore that deale vnmercifully
with others, doe moſt hurt to themſelues, becauſe thereby they
prouoke God to deale vnmercifully with them. Conſider this
O wrathfull &amp; reuengefull perſons. The time may come when
you will as earneſtly deſire one drop of Gods mercy, as Diues
deſired a drop of water to coole his tongue: and yet you ſhall
haue your deſire no more ſatisfied then his was.
               This conſequence of Gods retaining their ſinnes who forgiue
not their brethren,Motiue to forgiue. doth much enforce the a fore-mentioned154.
                  
exhortation to forgiue. As there was ſhewed the great aduantage
of forgiuing others (which is aſſurance of Gods forgiuing
them) ſo here is declared the great damage of not forgiuing:
which is a ſtrict exaction of the vttermoſt penaltie for
all that debt wherein we ſtand bound to Gods iuſtice. He that
from his heart forgiueth not his brother that hath offended
him,Quiſquis in ſe delinquen

his words be, in effect he prayeth that God would not

                  Q. VVHat is to bee obſerued about the order of the fift
Petition?
               
                  A. 1. That which it hath common with
the ſixt?
               2. That which is proper to it ſelfe.
               Two things are common to them both.
               1. The diſtinct kinde of them both is the ſame.
               2. The generall matter
               
               The diſtinct kinde wherein theſe two laſt Petitions differ
from all the reſt, is Deprecation, that is, Prayer for the remouall
of euill. In the fift Petition we pray to bee freed from the guilt
and puniſhment of ſinne. In the ſixt, from the power and bondage
of ſinne.
               
                  
Q. What doe we hence learne?
               
                  A. Deprecation muſt be added to Petition. We muſt be carefull
as well to pray againſt thoſe euils which doe, or may annoy
vs, as for thoſe good things which may, or doe helpe vs,
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      1. Tim. 2. 1. This
kinde is expreſſely mentioned among the other warrantable
kindes of Prayer: and on all occaſions it hath been vſed by the
Saints. Accordingly it may and muſt be vſed by vs, and that in
regard of Gods glory, and our owne good.
               1. The glory of Gods pittie and power is much magnified
hereby. Of his pittie, in that by going to him in all our miſeries
we acknowledge him to be a God of compaſſion, moued with
our miſeries: elſe could we haue no heart to goe to him. The
ſeruants of the King of Syria perſwade their Lord, being
ouerthrowne in battell to go with ſackcloth vpon their loynes,1. King. 20. 31.
and ropes vpon their heads to the King of Iſrael, on this
ground, We haue heard that the Kings of the houſe of Iſrael are
mercifull Kings. Were we not perſwaded that he to whom we
goe, is pittifull and mercifull, ſcarce ſhould we be moued to lay
open our ſores before him. Well, markeNum. 14. 18, 19. the prayers of the
Saints, and you ſhall finde the mercy, pitie and compaſſion of
God much pleaded in them.Dan. 9. 9. 
                  The glorie of Gods power is alſo
magnified by Deprecations,Pſal. 51. 1. in that he is acknowledged to bee
for all turnes able to doe, and able to vndoe. Able to doe that
good for vs which he ſeeth to be needfull for vs: and able to
vndoe that knot of miſery wherewith thorow our owne folly
we are bound, and to breake thoſe ſnares wherewith wee are
entangled.
               2. Our need requireth, that being in miſery we ſhould be
deliuered out of it: or elſe all the good that can be beſtowed
vpon vs, will bee but as a ſhew or ſhadow of goodneſſe: no
ſweetneſſe thereof can be taſted: no benefit can bee reaped
thereby. Abraham conceiuing it to bee a great miſery to be
childleſſe,Gen 15, 1, 2. when God graciouſly promiſed him to be his ſhield,
and exceeding great reward, he anſwered, What wilt thou giue
me, ſeeing I goe childleſſe? This ſuppoſed euill tooke away the
ſweetneſſe from that exceeding great reward which was proffered
to him. The Iſraelites being in grieuous bondage, when
Moſes came to them in the name of the Lord to comfort

them,Exod. 6. 9. 
                  They hearkned not to him for anguiſh of ſpirit. All the delights
which the heart of man can deſire are as nothing to him
that is ſicke at heart, or tortured with tormenting diſeaſes, if
he bee not freed from that ſickneſſe, and eaſed of that paine.
               In what a deſperate caſe may we now thinke them to be,
that, being in miſerie, either ſeeke no helpe at all: or, which
is all one, ſeeke helpe of ſuch as can afford them no true
helpe.
               Of the former ſort are
               1.Refuſers of helpe in miſery. Such as thorow a blockiſh ſtupiditie, like beaſts, lye vnder
that euill which lyeth vpon them: and ſeeme not to be moued
therewith, as thoſe Iewes of whom the Prophet thus complaineth,
O Lord thou haſt ſtricken them,
                  Ier. 5. 3. 
                  but they haue not grieued,
&amp;c.
               
               2. Such as through wilfull obſtinacie are ſo farre from praying
to haue the euill that is on them remoued, as by continuing
in ſin, they bring more and more euill vpon them: like Ahaz,
who therefore is thus branded,2. Chro. 28. 22. 
                  This is Ahaz.
               
               3. Such as through a malitious impudencie, when they are pinched
and preſſed with the euill that lyeth on them, blaſpheme
the Name of God, as the prophane2. King. 6. 33. 
                  King of Iſrael, andRen. 16. 8, 9. they
who were tormented at the pouring out of the fourth viall,
did.
               Of the latter ſort are,Seekers of helpe where no helpe is.
               
               1. Such as truſt to meanes without God: as2. Chro. 56. 12 
                  Aſa, who
ſought not to the Lord, but to the Phyſitians: and theIſa. 31. 1. 
                  Iſraelites who
went downe to Egypt for helpe, but ſought not the Lord.
               
               2. Such as ſeeke helpe of ſuch things as haue no powre or
vertue at all to helpe them in that for which helpe is ſought: as
they, who, being troubled in conſcience and wounded in ſoule,
ſeeke to eaſe themſelues by merrie company, muſicke, gaming,
and the like. So1. Sam. 16. 17. 
                  Saul, when the euill ſpirit came vpon him, muſt
needs haue muſicke: and the1. King. 18. 26, 28. 
                  Baalites when their requeſt was
not granted, Leaped vpon the Altar, and cut themſelues with kniues
and lancers: and Papiſts to like purpoſes whip themſelues: yea
alſo they ſeeke to driue the Diuell away with holy water, holy
oile, crucifixes, croſſing themſelues, and other like fooliſh
toyes.
               
                  
3. Such as ſeeke helpe of him that will take all aduantages
againſt them, and worke them the more miſchiefe for truſting
to him, euen the Diuell himſelfe. All that go to Witches, Coniurers,
Sorcerers, and ſuch inſtruments of Satan, for helpe in any
need, ſeeke helpe of Satan: as1. Sam. 28. 8. 
                  Saul that went to the Witch at
Endor: and2. King. 1. 2. 
                  Ahaziah that ſent to Baal-zebub.
               
               All theſe, and other like helpes are no better then aEzek. 29. 7. reede,
whereupon if a man leane it breaketh, and renteth his fleſh that
leaneth thereon.
               For our part therefore let vs take notice of the euils whereunto
we are ſubiect,What euils are to be prayed againſt, and how, See in the whole Armour of God, on Eph. 6. 18. and of the remedie warranted and ſanctified

As in the fourth Petition wee were taught to pray for ſuch temporall
bleſſings as were meet for our bodies,Poſt ſubſidium cibi petitur &amp; ve nia delicti, vt qui à Deo paſcitur in Deo viuat: nec tantum praeſenti &amp; temporali vitae, ſed &amp; aternae conſulatur. Cypr. de Orat. Dom. §. 16. and for our outward
eſtate in this world: ſo in the fift and ſixt Petitions wee
are taught to ſeeke ſuch ſpirituall bleſſings as concern the good
of our ſoule, that he who is fed of God may liue in God.
               Q. What are we taught hereby?
               A. We muſt take care of our ſpirituall welfare. Care muſt be had for
the good of our ſoules as well as of our bodies.Ioh. 6. 27. Where Chriſt
moueth vs to moderate our immoderate care for the things of
this world, he preſſeth vs, earneſtly to care for our ſoules. And
that not without iuſt cauſe.Mat. 6. 33. For
               1. Our happineſſe conſiſteth in the ſpirituall well-fare of
our ſoules.Pſal. 32. 2. 
                  Bleſſed is the man vnto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquitie,
and in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile.
               
               2. Herein lyeth a maine difference, not onely betwixt reaſonable
and vnreaſonable creatures, or ciuill &amp; ſauage men, or
Profeſſors of true religion and idolaters, but alſo betwixt all

                  naturall and ſpirituall men. The naturall man, whether he liue
in the Church or out of it, mindeth onely the things of this life.
The things of the Spirit of God,
                  1. Cor. 2. 14. which concerne his ſoule and the
ſpirituall good thereof, He receiueth not; for they are fooliſhneſſe to
him. Onely the ſpirituall man, who is both in the Church and
of the Church, enlightned and guided by that Spirit which is in
the Church, and in euery part and member thereof, well diſcerning
the things of the Spirit of God, tending to the happineſſe
of his ſoule, doth carefully ſeeke after them.
               The folly of moſt men is hereby diſcouered.1. Reproofe. For their care is
wholly and onely for the things of this life. They neglect their
ſoules, as if they had no ſoules at all to care for, or cared not
what became of them. Their owne Prouerbe verifieth as
much againſt them, which is this, Let God take care for my ſoule,
and I will take care for my bodie. A curſed Prouerbe. In both the
parts thereof it ſauoureth ranke of Atheiſticall prophaneneſſe.
The latter part implyeth a deſperate caſting off Gods care for
their bodies: the former, a preſumptuous thruſting of their
ſoules on God, againſt that courſe which he hath expreſly preſcribed.
               Let vs learne wiſedome from this ground of wiſedome
taught by him that is the wiſedome of God.2. Aduice. Let vs not diſioyne
the care of theſe two ſweete companions, which God
hath ſo nearely linked together, our bodie and ſoule. Let both in
their place and due manner be cared for. Let ſpirituall things
be prouided for the ſoule, which is a ſpirituall ſubſtance, as
well as earthly things for the body which is of the earth. By
that care which nature moueth vs to take for the temporall
good of our bodies, we ought to be ſo farre from reſting therein,
as we ought rather to be raiſed vp thereby to ſeeke how we
may procure good to our ſoules. Surely Chriſt by inferring the
Petitions for our ſoules good, immediatly vpon that which
concerneth the good of our bodies, intendeth thereby, that by
ſence of our bodies need we ſhould be made ſencible of the
ſoules need.
               For this end, let vs
               1. Take notice of our ſpirituall needs. Ignorance of need
maketh men negligent of prouiding things needfull. Laodicea
                  
not knowing that ſhe was wretched,
                  Reu 3. 16, 17, 18 
                  miſerable, poore, blind and naked,
regarded not the gold that might make her rich, the white
rayment that might couer the ſhame of her nakedneſſe, and the eye-ſalue
that might make her ſee.
               
               2.Prou. 2. 4. Enquire after the meanes of helpe.—4. 5. The wiſe man doth oft
much preſſe this dutie of ſeeking and ſearching after the things
that are needfull and vſefull.—8. 5.
               
               3. Conſcionably and carefully vſe the meanes which are afforded
for helpe. This was the counſell which Chriſt gaue to the
forenamed Church of the Laodiceans, to buy gold tried in the fire,
and white raiment,
                  Reu. 3. 18. and to annoint her eyes with eye-ſalue.
               
            
            
               §. 158. Of doubling our care for the good of
our ſoules.
               
                  Q. WHy are there two Petitions for our ſpirituall good?
               
                  A. 1. The things concerning our ſpirituall
eſtate are farre more excellent: as the ſoule is more
excellent then the bodie,Things of the ſoule moſt excellent. and as things concerning eternall and
heauenly happineſſe ſurpaſſe ſuch as concerne onely a temporall
and earthly contentment.Mat. 13. 44, 45, 46. The Merchant that ſold all that
he had to buy the treaſure hid in the field, and the pearle of price, was
not ignorant hereof.
               2. They are more abſolutely neceſſarie.Things of the ſoule moſt neceſſarie. We may want the
temporall things of this world, and yet not be miſerable. God
can turne that want to our aduantage.Luke 10. 42. But the want of ſpirituall
bleſſings maketh vs extreamely miſerable. True happineſſe
conſiſteth in the fruition of theſe. Yea the happineſſe of
our temporall well-fare conſiſteth in our ſpirituall well-fare.
No benefit, no comfort can be receiued from all that this world
affordeth, vnleſſe ſinne be pardoned and we freed from the power
thereof.
               3. We are by nature more dull and backward to ſeeke after
things ſpirituall,Man careleſſe of his ſoule. then temporall. Theſe are viſible, and the
ſweetneſſe of them is more ſenſible, ſooner diſcerned, and more
eaſily taſted. The other being inuiſible, are more inſenſible.
So as we haue more need to be the more earneſt in ſeeking of
them.
               
                  
Q. What are we taught hereby?
               
                  A. Our care for ſpirituall things muſt be double. With much
more earneſtneſſe muſt we ſeeke ſpirituall then temporall bleſſings.
It is of ſpirituall good things that Chriſt ſaith,Mat. 6. 33. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  Firſt
ſeeke, &amp;c. Both before and aboue all other things ſeeke them.
Firſt, doth not onely note out the order, but alſo the manner of
ſeeking.2 Pet 1. 10. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Of ſpirituall bleſſings it is That Saint Peter ſaith, Rather
giue diligence, or giue the more and greater diligence to make
them ſure. Our mind muſt with the vtmoſt of our endeauour,
euen with full bent be carried that way.
               A due conſideration of this point doth manifeſt the2. Pet. 1. 9. 
                  blindneſſe,
and aggrauate the folly of them who preferre temporall
before ſpirituall bleſſings:Mar. 5. 17. like to the Gadarens, who made
more account of their ſwine then of Chriſt. Into this ſhip of
fooles may they well be thruſt
               1. Who put of the time for ſeeking the good of their ſoules,Who preferre things temporall before ſpirituall.
but will looſe no time for aduancing and encreaſing their temporall
eſtate. They who put off their prouiding of oyle till the
houre wherein the Bridegroome came are ſtiled fooliſh Virgins.
                  Mat. 25. 2, &amp;c.
               
               2. Who put bie the opportunities that by Gods prouidence
are afforded for doing good to their ſoules. As Felix, who
when by Pauls preaching his heart was ſo ſmitten as he trembled,
                  Acts 24. 26, 27.
ſaid, Go thy way for this time: and yet watched all opportunities
for a bribe.
               3. Who ſo eagerly purſue the things of this world, wherein
they take delight,Gen. 25. 29, &amp;c. or from whence they expect profit, as they
neglect the care of their ſoules. Such an one was prophane Eſau,
who followed the profits and pleaſures of the field till hee
fainted, and then ſold his birth-right for a meſſe of pottage.
               4. Such as ſeeke the ſpirituall things of their ſoule, but ſo
looſely and careleſly as if they cared not much for them. Theſe
are like the Luke-warme Laodiceans who can expect nothing
but to be ſpued out of the mouth of Chriſt.Reu. 3. 15, 16.
               
               Let vs be otherwiſe minded: and for that end,
               1. Well diſcerne betwixt things that differ.Direction. Till the vnderſtanding
be throughly enformed in the difference of matters,
and know which are the more excellent, the will cannot encline

it ſelfe to one more then to another. This therefore doth
the Apoſtle pray for in the Philippians behalfe,
                     Phil. 1. 10. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      vt dignoſcatis quae diſcrepant. Pſal. 4. 6. 
                  To diſcerne things
that differ.
               
               2. Wiſely prefer
                     •
                  e the more excellent. As Dauid, who,
when others ſaid, Who will ſhew vs any good? (meaning temporall
goods) thus prayed to God, Lord lift thou vp the light of thy
countenance vpon vs?
               
               3. Stirre vp the gift of God.
                  2. Tim. 1. 6. That deſire, that loue, that delight
that in any meaſure is in thee towards the ſpirituall good
things of thy ſoule, nouriſh, and encreaſe, that they neither decay
nor die in thee.
               4. Helpe the weakneſſe of nature.Mat. 26. 41. When the ſpirit is ready,
the fleſh will be backward.Rom. 7. 21, 23. And when one would do good, euill is
preſent with him. A law in the members warreth againſt the law of
the mind. This oft maketh vs dull, heauie and ſluggiſh. Wherefore
(as the wiſe man aduiſeth) when the iron is blunt,
                  Eccl. 10. 10. 
                  put to more
ſtrength.
               
               
                  Hitherto of the generall matter common to the two laſt Petitions.
               
            
            
               §. 159. Of the bleſſings which Pardon of ſinne
bringeth.
               
                  Q. VVHat proper thing is to be conſidered about the order of
the fift Petition?
               
                  A. 1. The inference of it vpon the fourth.
               2. The Precedence of it before the ſixt.
               Q. What doctrine doth that inference afford?
               A. By pardon of ſinne the things of this world are made true bleſſings.
All the things which in this prayer we are taught to craue,
are ſo to be craued as bleſſings. But ſinne is as deadly poyſon
to daily bread: while it remaineth vpon vs vnpardoned, nothing
that this world affordeth can be a true bleſſing: for ſinne
bringeth a curſe vpon euerie creature that we vſe:Deut. 28. 16, &amp;c. but pardon of
ſinne taketh away that curſe, and ſo maketh all that wee vſe to
be true bleſſings.Pſal. 32. 1. That man therefore is pronounced bleſſed whoſe
tranſgreſſion is forgiuen.
               
               Learne hereby in the vſe of all temporall bleſſings to ſeeke

for pardon of ſinne. It is one end of Grace before meate (according
to the1. Sam. 9. 13. Math. 14. 19. Luke 24. 30. Acts 27. 35. ancient and commendable cuſtome of Gods people)
to haue the curſe taken away from the creatures we vſe, and
to haue them turned into a bleſſing. Do the like, craue pardon
of ſinne, before thou goeſt about the worke of thy calling, before
thou takeſt a iourney, before thou goeſt to any recreation
though thou knoweſt it to be lawfull and meete, before thou
goeſt to bed, when thou riſeſt vp, in all things, at all times ſeeke
remiſſion of ſinne. Neuer thinke thy ſelfe well or ſafe, no not
in thy greateſt abundance or beſt proſperitie till thou haue aſſurance
thereof.Gen. 4. 7. 
                  Sinne not remitted lieth as a bondage at the doore,
and keepeth all Gods bleſſings from entring.Lam. 3. 44. 
                  Sinne, like a
cloud, hideth from vs the bright Sunne-ſhine of Gods fauour.
Sinne like the accurſed thing which Achan ſtole,Ioſ. 7. 11. &amp;c. 2. King. 4. 40. maketh vs a
prey to our deadlieſt enemies. Sinne, as the wilde gourdes, bringeth
death with it, and that into ſuch things as are otherwiſe
wholeſome,Dan. 5. 5, 6. and good. Sinne, like that hand-writing which on
a wall appeared to Bel-ſhazzar, in the middeſt of our greateſt
iolletie, will change countenance, trouble thoughts, looſe ioynts, and
make knees to ſmite one againſt another. Is there not then great
and iuſt cauſe in all things at all times to ſeeke pardon
thereof?
               
                  This of the Inference of the fift Petition on the fourth.
               
            
            
               §. 160. Of the precedence of Iuſtification
before Sanctification.
               
                  Q. VVHat Doctrine doth the precedence of the fift Petition
before the ſixt import?
               A. Iuſtification goeth before Sanctification. For
the former of the two laſt Petitions concerning our ſpirituall
good ſetteth out our Iuſtification, the latter, our Sanctification.
This precedence is to be applyed rather to Order, then to Time.
For at that very moment that Chriſt pardoneth ſinne, he conueigheth
his Spirit into vs whereby ſinne is mortified. S. Paul
therefore where hee ſetteth downe theſe two together, ſetteth
Righteouſneſſe before Sanctification.
               
               Iuſtification cauſeth Sanctification:1. Cor. 1. 30. in which reſpect the

Apoſtle ſaith that we are ſanctified by faith in Chriſt,
                  Acts 26. 18. that is, faith
vniting vs to Chriſt, by whom we are iuſtified, receiueth grace
for grace, a further grace to ſanctifie vs.
               Sanctification declareth Iuſtification:Iam. 2. 24. in which reſpect Saint
Iames ſaith, that we are iuſtified by workes: that is, declared
ſo to be. As by vertue of our Iuſtification wee are preſented
blameleſſe before God: ſo by vertue of our Sanctification wee
are declared to be righteous before men.
               As the cauſe therefore goeth before the effect, and as the
effect followeth the cauſe, ſo are Iuſtification and Sanctification
in their order one to another.
               1. This order affordeth one ſound argument againſt Iuſtification
by workes.Rom. 3. 28.—11. 6. All good workes are parts of Sanctification.
If by the merit of them we be iuſtified, Sanctification muſt goe
before Iuſtification.
               2. This order proueth our Iuſtification to be free.Rom. 3. 24. Becauſe
in order of nature it goeth before any good thing that wee
can do.
               3. It alſo demonſtrateth the precedence of faith before acceptable
repentance, in order of nature. Faith is the inſtrument
of our Iuſtification, Repentance a principall grace of our
Sanctification.
               4. It layeth downe the ground of pardon of ſinne:Pſal. 51. 1. which is,
nothing in our ſelues, but the meere free grace of God, which is
to be pleaded for obtaining pardon.
               
                  Thus much of the Order of the fift Petition. The particular
good things to be craued, are next to be declared.
               
            
            
               
               §. 161. Of graces to be prayed for in regard of
the pardon of our owne ſinnes.
               Q. VVHat are the particular good things for which wee
are taught to pray by vertue of the Fift Petition?
               
                  A. 1. Such as concerne the Petition it
ſelfe.
               2. Such as concerne the condition annexed to it. The things
which concerne the Petition it ſelfe haue reſpect to the pardon
both of our owne, and of others ſinnes. For wee are taught to
ſay in the plurall number and firſt perſon, Forgiue VS OVR
treſpaſſes.
               
               Q. What are the things that concerne the pardon of our owne
ſinnes to be prayed for?
               
                  A. 1. Knowledge of the nature of ſinne: how horrible a thing
it is: into what a wofull plight it bringeth the creature, making
it a debter to the reuenging iuſtice of God.Deut. 28. 15, 16, &amp;c. For this end doth
the Law diſtinctly ſet downe the curſes which by ſinne are pulled
on man.
               2. Knowledge of a mans owne ſinnes. How he himſelfe being
guilty of ſinne is a debter to God: and in that reſpect in a moſt
wofull eſtate. This did Dauid well know when he ſaid, I know
mine iniquitie: and Iob who ſaid, Behold, I am vile.
                  Pſal. 51. 3. Iob 40. 4.
               
               3. Sence of the burden of ſinne. All the knowledge that can
be had of the horribleneſſe of ſinne, and of the multitude and
hainouſneſſe of the ſinnes whereof wee ſtand guilty, will not
ſufficiently moue vs to be eaſed of the burden of them, till we
feele the weight thereof lying on our owne ſoules, and euen oppreſſing
them. This made Dauid ſo earneſtly deſire God not
to rebuke him in anger: For of that earneſt ſute he rendereth this
reaſon, Mine iniquities are gone ouer mine head: as an heauy burden
they are too heauy for me.
                  Pſal. 38. 1, 4.
               
               4. A broken heart, and contrite ſpirit. A man may feele the
heauy burden of ſinne, and yet not ſeeke to bee eaſed: but lye
vnder it as a beaſt: or as one that deſpaireth of all helpe. But if
the heart be truely broken, and touched to the quicke with the
ſence of ſinne, it will not let a man reſt till hee haue obtained

pardon.Pſal. 51. 17. In that Pſalme where Dauid moſt earneſtly craueth
pardon, he ſheweth that he had a broken heart.
               5. Humble confeſſion of ſinne. For this Petition is a plaine acknowledgement
thereof. WithoutProu 28. 13. 
                  confeſſion there is no hope
of pardon: but1. Ioh. 1. 9. Pſal 32. 5. promiſe of pardon is made to him that confeſſeth
his ſinne.
               6. Earneſt deſire of pardon. That we may be freed from the
guilt and puniſhment of ſinne. To confeſſe ſinne and not to deſire
pardon, is but to put in an euidence againſt our ſelues. This
is that which is moſt diſtinctly expreſſed in this Petition: and
which hath euer been performed by all the Saints.
               7. Knowledge of Gods free grace and rich mercy. Without
this, though a man neuer ſo much feele the burden of ſinne, he
hath no ſure ground, nor can haue any heart to ſeeke pardon. It
appeareth that Dauid was well inſtructed therein,Pſal. 51. 1. in that hee
doth ſo much plead and preſſe it.
               8. Vnderſtanding of the ſacrifice of Chriſt. What that ſacrifice
was;1. Pet. 1. 19. 
                  the pure and precious bloud of the Sonne of God. By
whom it was offered vp;Heb. 9. 14. 
                  by himſelfe thorow his eternall Spirit.
For whom; euen for vs
                  1. Tim. 1. 15. miſerable ſinners. To what end; to be
                  1. Tim. 2. 6. 
                  a ranſome for our ſinnes: that ſo ſatisfaction might be made
to Gods iuſtice for the ſame. This ſacrifice added to God
                     •
                   mercie
ſhewes how perfectly Gods mercy and iuſtice meet together
in mans Redemption. No maruell then that1. Cor. 2. 2. Saint Paul
deſired to know nothing but Ieſus Chriſt and him crucified.
               
               9. A right diſcerning of the perfection euen of the actiue obedience
of Chriſt, and of the end thereof: how heeMath. 3. 15. 
                  fulfilled all
righteouſneſſe: and howRom. 5. 19. we are made righteous thereby. Thus
we may ſee how the debt of obedience which wee owe, and
are not able to performe, is performed by our ſurety, and we by
reaſon thereof are accepted as righteous.
               10. An high eſteeme of Chriſt. For Chriſt, the great things
that he hath done and ſuffered, and the many great benefits
which iſſue from thence are not for hogges, that as vile things
will trample them vnder feet.Phil. 3. 8. Saint Paul accounted all things
but loſſe and dung in compariſon of Chriſt.
               11. Hungring and thirſting after Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe.
                  Luke 1 53.
Theſe are they that ſhall be ſatisfied and filled;
                  Math. 5. 6. and in that reſpect
are bleſſed.
               
               
                  
12. Faith in the pardon of ſinne. All the forenamed points
without this,Ioh. 5. 24. will but aggrauate a poore ſinners miſery. This
is it that bringeth a quietus eſt,
                  Luke. 7. 50. a full diſcharge with it. In the
diſeaſe and diſtreſſe of the ſoule thorow ſinne, Chriſt will ſay
as he did to ſuch as were afflicted in body,Math. 8. 13.—9. 22. 
                  As thou haſt beleeued,
ſo be it vnto thee: Thy faith hath made thee whole.
               
               13. Peace of conſcience.
                  Rom. 5. 1. This followeth faith, and giueth
good euidence to the ſoule of the diſcharge thereof from
ſinne.
               
                  Theſe are eſpeciall graces, that reſpect the pardon of our owne
ſinnes.
               
            
            
               §. 162. Of graces to be prayed for in regard
of the pardon of others ſinnes.
               
                  Q. VVHat things in regard of the pardon of others ſinnes
are to be prayed for?
               
                  A. 1. Compaſſion by reaſon of them. Conſidering the wofull
plight where into ſinne bringeth men, our bowels ought to
be moued thereat.Mar. 3. 5. It is noted of Chriſt that he grieued for the
hardneſſe of the Iewes hearts. Was there not great compaſſion in
him that thus prayed for others,Exo, 32. 31, 32. 
                  Oh this people haue ſinned a
great ſinne: yet now if thou wilt forgiue their ſinne: and if not, blot
me out of thy Booke. This compaſſion will make vs as earneſt for
the pardon of the ſinnes of others as of our owne.
               2. Humiliation for them.Ezr, 9. 3. Good Ezra was ſo deiected and
humbled for the ſinnes of others, as hee rent his garment and
Mantle, and pluckt off the haire of his head, and beard, and fell
downe aſtonied.
               
               3. Confeſſion of them. It was vſuall with the Saints to confeſſe
vnto God the ſins of others. For which purpoſe the confeſſions
ofExod. 32. 31. 
                  Moſes, ofEzr. 9. 6, 7. 
                  Ezra, ofNeh. 1. 6. 
                  Nehemiah, ofNeh. 9. 16, &amp;c the Leuites, of
Dan. 9. 20. 
                  Daniel, and of others are worthy to be obſerued. Humiliation
and confeſſion of others ſinnes is an euidence of an holy
zeale of Gods glory. Feare of the iuſt vengeance of ſinne may
make vs humble our ſelues for our owne ſinnes, and penitently
confeſſe them to God. But to be ſo affected for others ſinnes,
as it ſheweth a brotherly fellow-feeling, ſo an holy indignation

againſt ſinne, as it is a ſinne offenſiue to the diuine Maieſtie.
               4. Supplication for the pardon of them. This is the maine
dutie expreſſely taught in this Petition. It is an eſpeciall meanes
of obtaining pardon for others ſinnes. But it is not in our own
power to doe it?Zac. 12. 10. It is a gift of the Spirit, and a gift promiſed.
We may therefore, yea and we muſt pray for it. And hauing it,
then ſay to God as Moſes did,Num. 14. 19. 
                  Pardon, I beſeech thee, the iniquitie
of this people: and as Chriſt did,Luke 23. 34 
                  Father, forgiue them:
and as Stephen did,Act. 7. 60. 
                  Lord lay not their ſinne to their charge.
               
               
                  Theſe are principall graces to bee prayed for, by vertue of the
maine Petition.
               
            
            
               §. 163. Of the graces which are to be prayed for by
reaſon of the condition annexed to the
Fift Petition.
               
                  Q. VVHat graces are to be prayed for by vertue of the condition
annexed to the Fift Petition?
               
                  A. In generall, ſuch a minde to our brother as wee deſire
God to beare to vs. This Chriſt implyeth vnder this one word
mercifull, where he ſaith,Luk▪ 6. 36. 
                  Be yee mercifull as your heauenly Father
is alſo mercifull. Hereby as in a Looking-glaſſe ſhall we ſet
out Gods minde to man, and1. Pet. 2. 9. 
                  ſhew forth the praiſes of God: yea
andLuke 7. 47. gaine good euidence of Gods good minde to our ſelues.
               In particular, ſuch graces as follow.
               1. Loue. This is a dutie that hath beene required1. Ioh. 3. 11. 
                  from the
beginning: and it is theMath. 5. 44. ground of all goodneſſe, kindneſſe,
and forgiueneſſe.Epheſ. 4. 32. Where the Apoſtle exhorteth to forgiue, he
addeth this direction,—5. 2. 
                  walke in loue, ſhewing thereby that loue
will make men forward to forgiue.
               2. Meekeneſſe.
                  1. Pet. 3. 4. This is in the ſight of God of great price. It
is of ſpeciall vſe to keepe a man from being prouoked, and
from deſire of reuenge. Chriſt being of a meeke ſpirit,—2. 23. 
                  when
he was reuiled, reuiled not againe. Moſes being commended for
a very meeke man,
                  Numb. 12. this is giuen as an euidence and proofe
thereof, that hee was not prouoked to wrath by the wrong

which Aaron and Miriam did him.
               3. Compaſſion: or, to vſe the Scripture phraſe, bowels of mercies.
                  Col. 3. 12. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     .
This maketh vs pitie ſuch as wrong vs. And becauſe in
doing wrong to vs, we know they doe themſelues the greateſt
hurt, a compaſſionate ſpirit wil worke in vs more pitie towards
them, then reuenge againſt them: and in that reſpect to pray
for them euen when they are wronging vs,Luke 23. 34. as Chriſt and Stephen
did.Acts 7. 60.
               
               4. Long-ſuffering. That doth the Apoſtle adde to the forenamed
meekeneſſe,
                  Col. 3 12. and bowels of mercies. This keepeth a man
from being ouercome with multitudes of wrongs. God himſelfe
is ſaid to be a God of long-ſuffering,
                  Pſal. 103. 8. in that hee continueth
to paſſe by many wrongs time after time, without executing
iudgement and reuenge vpon the doers thereof. In regard of
the many wrongs whereunto, while we liue in this world, wee
are ſubiect, long-ſuffering is neceſſary.
               5. Power ouer wrath. Hereby though it doe ſo fall out that
anger be ſtirred vp in vs by the iniuries of wicked men, yet by
holding it in, as it were with bit and bridle, wee may bee kept
from exceſſe, and from ſinne, according to this intimation of the
Apoſtle,Epheſ. 4. 26. 
                  Be angry but ſinne not. Herein lyeth a maine difference
betwixt naturall men, and men regenerate. Becauſe in naturall
men there is fleſh onely, when anger is kindled, it burneth more
and more. But becauſe in men regenerate there is ſpirit as well
as fleſh,Gal. 5. 16, 17. by that ſpirit the luſts of the fleſh are ſuppreſſed
and quenshed:1. Sa. 25. 32, &amp;c. as is euident in the caſe betwixt Dauid and
Nabal.
               
               6. Forgetfulneſſe of wrongs. That wee ſuffer not them to abide
continually in our minde and memory. Thus doth God
deale with treſpaſſes committed againſt him. I will remember
their ſinne no more, ſaith hee.Ier. 31. 34. It is a part of the renouation of
memory, to let ſlip, forget, and not to hold and retaine euill
things,
                  1. Kin. 11. 14. &amp;c and in particular reuenge. Remembrance of wrongs,
encreaſeth deſire of reuenge. But forgetfulneſſe thereof cauſeth
fulleſt forgiueneſſe.
               7. Readineſſe to forgiue.
                  Epheſ. 4. 32. This is the maine thing intended in
this condition. All the other graces before mentioned are but
preparations hereunto.
               
                  
8. Truth in the act of forgiueneſſe.
                  1. Ioh 3. 18. Herein lyeth the liuelyeſt,
and beſt reſemblance betwixt Gods forgiuing and
ours. This is eſpecially intended in this Particle of reſemblance,
As.
               
                  Hitherto of the good things which by vertue of the Fift Petition,
and the condition annexed thereto, are to be prayed for.
               
            
            
               §. 164. Of the things for which thankes is to be
giuen by vertue of the Fift Petition.
               
                  Q. WHat are the particular good things for which by vertue
of the Fift Petition we are to be thankefull?
               
                  A. 1. Such as concerne Gods forgiuing vs our treſpaſſes.
               2. Such as concerne our forgiuing other men their treſpaſſes.
               They which concerne Gods forgiuing vs, are ſuch as follow:
               1. Gods free grace, In that for his owne ſake, without any
deſert of ours he paſſeth by and pardoneth our ſinnes. In this
reſpect doth the Prophet magnifie him,Mic. 7. 18. and ſay, Who is a God
like to thee, that pardoneth iniquitie, &amp;c. He retaineth not his anger
for euer, becauſe he delighteth in mercy.
               
               2. Gods rich mercy: In that notwithſtanding our many,
foule, and hainous ſinnes, the ſpring of his grace is not dryed
vp, but he is pleaſed to forgiue them all. This incited Paul to
make knowne his thankefull minde to God.1. Tim. 1. 12, 13, 14, &amp;c.
               
               3. Gods long-ſuffering, In that he hath not taken that aduantage
againſt vs, which we from time to time haue giuen him:
but rather by his patience hath led vs vnto repentance.Pſal. 103. 8. The
perſon that duely conſidereth how many iuſt occaſions hee
hath giuen to God to cut him off, and to giue him his portion
with the damned and Deuils in hell, being brought to ſome
aſſurance of the pardon of ſinne, cannot but heartily bleſſe
God for his good and great patience towards him.
               4. Chriſt Ieſus.
                  Math. 1. 21. Hee it is that ſaueth people from their ſinnes.
This is the greateſt matter of thankſgiuing that euer was, or
can be giuen to ſonnes of men.Luke 1, 46, 47. The Virgin Mary therefore at
her firſt conception of him,Luke 2. 10. 
                  magnifyeth the Lord. The Angell
that firſt brought the newes of Chriſts Birth, proclaimeth it to

be a glad tidings of great ioy.
                  —14. Yea a Quire of heauenly ſpirits
ſang praiſe thereat, ſaying, Glory to God in the Higheſt.
               
               5. The obedience which Chriſt yeelded to the Law. For
our ſakes it was:1. Cor. 30, 31. 
                  vnto vs is he made righteouſneſſe, that we might
glory in the Lord.
               
               6. The ranſome which hee paid for vs. Among many other
bleſſings for which the Apoſtle giueth thankes,Col. 1. 12. 14. 
                  the bloud of
Chriſt by which wee haue forgiueneſſe of ſinnes,
                  Heb. 9. 12. is one. And well
may it bee one. For by it eternall Redemption is obtained.
               
               7. The Interceſſion which Chriſt continueth to make for vs.
                  Rom. 8. 34. Herein doth the Apoſtle after an holy manner triumph, which
is an eſpeciall kinde of glorifying God. Great cauſe haue wee
ſo to doe. For hereby all the vertue and efficacy of Chriſts ſacrifice,
is applyed to vs.
               8. The Goſpell, whereby all the forenamed bleſſings are
reuealed.Col. 1. 3, 5, 6. Expreſſely doth the Apoſtle giue thankes for this.
All the rich treaſures of the myſterie of Godlineſſe would be
of no vſe to vs, if by the Goſpell they were not opened
to vs.
               9. The Sacraments, whereby remiſſion of ſinnes is ſealed
vp,Acts 8. 39.—16. 33, 34. and ſo ratified and aſſured vnto vs. When the Eunuch,
and the Iayler were baptized, they reioyced: which being
done ſpiritually in the Lord, it includeth a praiſing of God.
And to ſhew that the holy communion is a matter of thanksgiuing,
the Apoſtle ſtileth it,1. Cor. 10 16. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  the cup of bleſſing: And from
the Primitiue times of the Church vnder the Goſpell it hath
beene called the Euchariſt,
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      Grata beneficij recordatio. that is A gratefull commemoration of
a thing.
               10. Sight, and ſence of ſinne, and ſorrow for the ſame. Theſe
are preparing graces, needfull for ſuch as expect pardon
of ſinne.2. Cor▪ 7. 9. The Apoſtle reioyced and thanked God for theſe
graces in the Corinthians.
                  Luke 7. 47. They are euidences of remiſſion.
               11. Vnderstanding of the myſteries of the Goſpell. The Goſpell
is a light that reuealeth thoſe myſteries. But what is light
without ſight? A blind man in the brighteſt ſun-ſhine receiueth
no benefit by the Sunne. The Apoſtle therefore that preached
the Goſpell to the Corinthians,
                  1. Cor. 1. 4, 5. 
                  thanked God that they were
enriched in all knowledge.
               
               
                  
12. Faith in the Lord Ieſus.
                  Luke 7. 50. By it pardon is obtained. Concerning
it thus ſaith the Apoſtle,Epheſ. 1. 15, 16. 
                  After I heard of your faith in
the Lord Ieſus, I ceaſe not to giue thankes for you.
               
               13. The fruits of faith, as a quiet conſcience, a ioyfull heart,
and comfortable ſpirit and ſuch like.2. Cor. 1. 4. Theſe being kindely
wrought, giue euidence of our diſcharge of ſinne.
               14. Meanes and euidence of pardon giuen to others. As wee
pray for the pardon of others ſinnes, ſo wee muſt be thankefull
for the euidences which wee ſee thereof. In this reſpect
the Church of the Iewes glorified God for repentance to life
granted to the Gentiles.
                  Acts 11. 18. This their repentance was an euidence
of Gods mercy in pardoning their ſinnes.
               
                  Theſe are good things for which God is to be praiſed by vertue
of the Fift Petition.
               
            
            
               §. 165. Of the things for which thankes is to be
giuen by vertue of the condition annexed
to the Fift Petition.
               
                  Q. VVHat are the particular good things for which
thankes is to be giuen to God by reaſon of the condition
annexed to the Petition?
               
                  A. 1. All the euidences of Gods indulgences towards vs in
pardoning our ſinnes. For to this end is our profeſſion of forgiuing
others heere expreſſed: where therefore there is ſuch
an euidence, as we may boldly make profeſſion thereof, wee
ought to be thankefull for it. Thus doth S. Paul giue thankes,
as for faith in the Lord Ieſus,
                  Col. 1. 3, 4. ſo for loue to all the Saints, an euidence
thereof.
               2. The meanes whereby wee are kept from taking reuenge. Thus
did Dauid bleſſe God for ſending Abigail to keepe him from
auenging himſelfe with his owne hand.
                  1. Sam. 25. 32, 33.
               
               3. The alteration of our wrathfull and reuengefull nature. We
could not in truth make this profeſſion,Rom. 6. 17. 
                  We forgiue, if our nature
were not altered.1. Tim, 1. 13.
               
               4. That meaſure of brotherly loue which we haue.2. Theſ. 1. 3. Without
loue all ſhew of forgiuing is but a meere ſhew.
               
                  
5. A ſpirit of meekeneſſe,
                  Iam. 3. 17. 
                  and patience. Theſe and other like
graces make vs readie and willing to forgiue. This Spirit commeth
from aboue:
                  Eph. 1. 3. and is one of thoſe ſpirituall bleſſings for which God
is to be bleſſed.
               
               6. An heart ſeaſoned with truth.
                  1. Chro. 29. 13, 17. By vertue thereof we are emboldned,
euen in relation to Gods forgiuing vs, to ſay, As we
forgiue.
               
               
                  Hitherto of the matter of Thankſgiuing which the fift Petition
affordeth.
               
            
            
               §. 166. Of Duties required in regard of deſire
of pardon of our owne and others ſinnes.
               
                  Q. VVHat Duties are we to endeuour after by vertue of the
fift Petition?
               
                  A. Both ſuch as concerne the Petition it ſelfe, and alſo the
Condition annexed to it.
               In regard of the Petition we ought
               1. To acquaint our ſelues with the Law of God. This is needfull
becauſe 1.Rom. 3. 20.—7. 7. By the Law is the knowledge of ſinne.
                  See the whole Armour of God. in Eph. 6. 16.
Thereby therefore wee ſhall know what ſinners we are, and
in how great need we do ſtand of pardon. 2.2. King. 22. 19. Acts 2. 37.—24. 26. By the Law is
mans ſoule humbled,Treat. 2. part. 6. § 20. pricked and broken, and thereby prepared
to ſeeke pardon. 3. By the Law man is ſtript of all ſelfe-conceipt.
Rom. 3. 19. 
                  Euery mouth is ſtopped and all the world made guiltie
thereby.
               
               2. To be well inſtructed in the Goſpell, and in the promiſes
thereof, asLuk. 1. 4. 
                  Theophilus was. For 1.Acts 26. 18. by the Goſpell the
grounds of pardon are reuealed. 2.Rom. 10. 8. Eph. 1. 13. By it faith is wrought.
3.Rom. 10. 15. Eph. 6. 15. By it the conſcience is quieted.
               3. To partake of the Sacraments. ForRom. 4. 11. they are ſeales of our
diſcharge.
               4. To confeſſe our ſinnes to God. For
                  1. Ioh. 1. 9. if we confeſſe our ſinnes,
God is faithfull and iuſt to forgiue vs our ſinnes.
               5. To aske pardon. This is the dutie here expreſſely ſet
downe.
               6. To beleeue pardon. ForMar. 1. 15. faith is a dutie required of all to
whom the Goſpell is Preached.
               
                  
Theſe are duties that concerne the pardon
of our owne ſinnes.
               Duties required in regard of the extent of this Petition for
the pardon of others ſinnes as well as our owne, are theſe that
follow.
               1. To take notice of the ſinnes of others, That ſo we may the better
diſcerne what great cauſe there is to pray for them. For
this end they which eſpied the great ſinnes of the Iewes, told
Ezra thereof.Ezr. 9. 1.
               
               2. To make knowne to other men ſinning, their ſinnes. Thus may
they be brought to be humbled and to find mercy for them; as
Dauid was humbled and found mercy.2. Sam. 12. 7, 8.
               
               3. To make confeſſion of them to God,
                  Exo. 10. 6. As Ezra, Daniel and others
did, and procured pardon.
               4. To pray for pardon for them,
                  Dan. 9
                        •
                     
                   As the forenamed Saints did.
For by a faithfull and feruant prayer of the righteous, if one haue
committed ſinnes they ſhall be forgiuen him.
                  Iam. 5. 15, 16.
               
               Theſe duties the Petition it ſelfe requireth.
            
            
               §. 267. Of Duties required by reaſon of our
Profeſſion to forgiue others.
               
                  Q. VVHat Duties are required by vertue of the Condition
annexed to the fift Petition.
               
                  A. 1. To take notice of Gods mercifull dealing with vs. For
this is the ground of the kinde of profeſſion here made, As we
forgiue.
                  Gen. 50. 20. 
                  Ioſeph taking notice of Gods good prouidence towards
him, made him the more kind to his brethren.
               2. To follow God in his goodneſſe.
                  Eph. 5. 1. A point expreſſely enioyned
by the Apoſtles. They that do not imitate God, cannot make
this profeſſion, As we forgiue.
               
               3. To put on ſuch graces as may make vs readie to forgiue. Theſe
are Bowels of mercies,Col. 3 12, 13. kindneſſe, humbleneſſe of minde, meekneſſe,
long-ſuffering, forbearing one another, &amp;c. Without theſe a man
will not be brought to forgiue wrongs.
               
               4. To put away reuengefull paſſions.
                  Col. 3. 8. As water extinguiſheth
ſparkes of fire, ſo a reuengefull humour putteth away all good

motions and intentions of forgiuing.
               5. To accept of all meanes of attonement offered,
                  1. Sam. 25. 35. As Dauid accepted
to the meanes which Abigail vſed to pacifie his wrath. This
will bring vs to forgiue.
               6. To offer reconciliation,
                  Gen. 13. 8. as Abraham did. There are ſome
of ſo crabbed a diſpoſition as they will neuer be reconciled,
though they bee the wrong doers, except they be ſought vnto.
Except therefore we ſeeke to them, there will be no reconciliation:
and if there be no reconciliation how can it be thought
that we can ſay in truth, Wee forgiue?
               
               7. Not to yeald to ſuch as incite vs to reuenge.
                  1. Sam. 25. 8, 9. Hereof we haue
a worthie patterne in Dauid.
                  2. Sam. 29. 21, 22 23. If we hearken to ſuch as ſtirre vs
vp to reuenge, we may be brought euen againſt our owne mind
and diſpoſition to take reuenge.
               8. Actually to forgiue.
                  Col. 3. 13. This is it which we plainly profeſſe.
We mocke him, who will not be mocked, and the truth is not
in vs, if wee vtter this condition, and do not indeed forgiue.
               9. To make peace betwixt others. For wee profeſſe in the plurall
number of others as of our ſelues that WE forgiue; we muſt
therefore endeauour that others may ſo do. And herein ſhall
we be bleſſed.Mat. 5. 9. 
                  Bleſſed are the peace-makers.
               
               
                  Hitherto of the Duties which both the Petition it ſelfe, and alſo the
Condition annexed thereto require.
               
            
            
               §. 168. Of that matter of Humiliation which the
fifth Petition affordeth.
               
                  Q. VVHat are the things to be bewailed by reaſon of the fift
Petition?
               
                  A. 1. Such as are againſt the Petition it ſelfe.
               2. Such as are againſt the Condition.Eccl. 7. 29.
               
               Againſt the Petition are ſuch as theſe.Infinitas rationes mali quibus implicatur homo, fateatur à ſe ipſo proficiſci, deploret, abdicet
                        •
                     , Trem. &amp; lun. in hunc. loc.
               
               1. Adams ſinne. Thereby did man firſt come to be endebted
to the reuenging iuſtice of God. On this ground the wiſe man
thus complaineth, Loe, this onely haue I found, that God hath made
man vpright: but they haue ſought out many inuentions.
               
               2. The guilt of Adams ſinne. This iuſtly is imputed to vs, becauſe

he was a publicke perſon, and did beare in his loynes all
that ſhall come from him to the end of the world. This therefore
doth the Apoſtle complaine of, where he ſaith, By the
offence of one,
                  Rom. 5. 18, 19. 
                  iudgement came vpon all men to condemnation. And, By
one mans diſobedience many are made ſinners.
               
               3. The many offences of our fore-fathers. By them are wee the
more deepely endebted to God.Nehe. 9. 16, 17. Theſe therefore do the people
of God bitterly bewaile.
               4. Originall ſinne: euen that corruption of our nature wherein
all are conceiued and borne. This containeth in it the ſeed
and ſpawne of all ſinne. And ſo deſileth vs throughout as in
euerie power of ſoule and part of bodie we are made loathſome,
odious, and abominable in Gods ſight. This therefore
doth Dauid with much compunction of heart acknowledge.Pſal. 51. 5.
               
               5. All our actuall ſinnes. Theſe are plaine, palpable debts:
which the moſt ignorant that be cannot denie to be ſo. Vnder
the burden of theſe the Saints in all ages haue much groaned.
The more in number, or the more hainous they haue bene, the
more grieued and perplexed the Saints haue bene for them.
Marke Dauids bitter complaint in this kinde.Pſal. 38. 3, 4. 
                  There is no reſt in
my bones becauſe of my ſinne. For mine iniquities are gone ouer my
head: as an heauie burthen they are too heauie for me.
               
               6. Our acceſſarineſſe to the ſinnes of others. Thus we adde to
the heape of our owne debts, the debts of others, whereby the
heape is made much greater.Pſal. 51. 14. The bloud, which Dauid with much
griefe acknowledgeth, was that which at his appointment Ioab
had cauſed to be ſhed.2. Sam. 2. 29, &amp;c. By his direction he made himſelfe acceſſarie
thereto.1. Sam. 3. 13. So Eli by his too great indulgencie and lenitie towards
his wicked ſonnes, made himſelfe acceſſarie to their ſin,
and liable to iudgement for the ſame.
               7. Our diſabilitie to diſcharge our debt of obedience. God gaue vs
power at firſt to fulfill all righteouſneſſe. But now there is,
while wee liue in this world,Rom. 8. 3. an impoſſibilitie thereto. Of
this doth Saint Paul thus complaine,Rom. 7. 18. 
                  To performe that which is
good I find not.
               
               8. Ignorance of the Goſpell. By the Goſpell the onely meanes
of diſcharging our debt is reuealed. How then can they be diſcharged

who know it not. In this reſpect doth the Apoſtle with
great griefe thus ſet forth the doome of ſuch ignorant perſons:
If our Goſpell be hid,
                  2. Cor. 4. 3. 
                  it is hid to them that are loſt, &amp;c.
               
               9. Hardneſſe of heart. This makes men ſenceleſſe both of the
burther of ſinne: and alſo of Gods wrath and vengeance againſt
ſinne: which maketh God to thinke of greater and greater vengeance.
When Chriſt obſerued hardneſſe to poſſeſſe the hearts
of the Iewes,Mar. 3. 5. he mourned for it.
               10. Infidelitie. This makes all the meanes of pardon prepared
and offered on Gods part, to be void on our part. In regard of
this,Iſa. 53. 1. the Prophet thus complaineth, Who hath beleeued our report?
               
               11. Euidences of Gods wrath vpon vs. Theſe are ſignes of the
debt of ſinne lying on our accompt, as not diſcharged. This
was the ground of the Prophet Ieremiahs Lamentation.
                  Lam. 1. 1. &amp;c.
               
               12. Gods wrath on others: eſpecially for our ſinne. We that
pray for the diſcharge of others ſinnes, haue cauſe to mourne
when we ſee the wrath of God lying on them for ſinne: eſpecially
if wee our ſelues haue bene any cauſe of procuring it. This
humbled Dauid,
                  2. Sam. 24. 17. and made him ſay, Loe, I haue ſinned, and I haue
done wickedly: but theſe ſheepe, what haue they done? Let thine hand be
againſt me, &amp;c.
               
               Theſe are things to be bewailed by reaſon of the fift Petition.
               Againſt the Condition vices to bee lamented are ſuch as
theſe,
               1. The teachineſſe of our nature: whereby it cometh to paſſe
that paſſion is ſoone ſtirred vp: and euery ſmall wrong maketh
vs thinke of reuenge.Gen. 37. 4, 18, 19. Small was the occaſion that Ioſephs brethren
tooke to execute reuenge vpon the youth.
               2. The violence of our paſſion. If paſſion bee once moued (as
ſoone it is moued) it is very readie to exceed and to grow into
extremitie.2. Tim. 3. 3. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      immites. Among other naturall corruptions of men the Apoſtle
reckoneth this, that they are fierce. How fierce was Saul againſt
Dauid?
               
               3. Our Implacableneſſe.
                  1. Sam. 20. 30. After men are once prouoked, they
are hardly pacified againe. This is another corruption of naturall
men reckoned vp by the Apoſtle,Rom. 1. 31. that they are implacable.
Though the Debter in the Parable fell downe at his Creditors
feete,
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      qui nullas 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      admit tunt implacabiles, irreconciliabiles. and beſought him, ſaying, Haue patience with me, and I will

pay thee all,
                  Mat. 18. 28, 29, 30. 
                  yet he would not: But after he had laid hands on him, and
taken him by the throate, he caſt him into priſon till hee ſhould pay
the debt.
               
               4. Our vnſatiableneſſe in taking reuenge. No reuenge ſeemeth
ſufficient to a reuengefull ſpirit (ſuch are all our ſpirits by nature.)
So much doth the Apoſtle imply in this deſcription of naturall
men,Rom. 3. 13, 15, 16. 
                  Their throate is an open ſepuchre; the poyſon of Aſpes is
vnder their lips; their feete are ſwift to ſhed bloud; deſtruction and miſerie
are in their waies.
                  Eſt. 3. 5, 6. 
                  Haman, onely becauſe Mordecai refuſed
to bow vnto him, Thought it a light matter to lay hands on Mordecai
alone, but thought to deſtroy all the Iewes throughout the whole
kingdome.
               
               To theſe vices,Eradicariaut extirpari à cordibu
                        •
                      noſtris omnino non poterit malitia donec in mundo fuerimu
                        •
                     . Bern. in Quadr. Serm. 6. 
                  Teachineſſe, Fierceneſſe, Implacableneſſe, Vnſatiableneſſe
in reuenge, wee are all by nature exceeding prone. Few
there be that, as occaſions are offered, doe not ſome way or other
manifeſt as much. Very hardly, if it all, will all maliciouſneſſe
be rooted out of vs, while fleſh remaineth in vs. Theſe vices
therefore afford vs much matter of griefe and humiliation,
and that both in regard of our ſelues, and of others alſo.
               Hitherto of the Fift Petition.
            
         
         
            
            THE SIXTH
PETITION.
            
               §. 169. Of the Summe and ſeuerall parts of the
ſixth Petition.
               
                  Q. VVHich is the ſixt Petition?
               
                  A. And leade vs not
into temptation:
                     Some diſtinguiſh theſe words, And leade vs not into temptation: but deliuer vs from euill, into two ſeuerall Petitions: making the ſubiect matter of the one to bee malum futurum, tuill to come, and of the other, malum praeſens, euill preſent, and alreadie fallen out. But this diſtinction in this place cannot hold. For the latter branch reſpecteth euill to come, as well as euill preſent. And the diſcretiue particle 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , but, ſheweth that they are not, as the other, diſtinct Petitions; for then would the laſt clauſe haue bene diſtinguiſhed from the former, as the former is from the fift Petition, and the fift from the fourth, thus, AND deliuer vs from euill, Many of the ancient Fathers (following the old Latine tranſlation) leaue out this laſt clauſe, and that becauſe they conceiue (as Saint Auguſtine expreſſeth their mind and meaning) it belongeth to the former concerning temptation: whereby they imply, that if both the clauſes were expreſſed, they would make but one Petition. Yet are they not to be taken as a repetition of one and the ſame point, but as two diſtinct parts and branches of the ſame generall matter: and ſo do moſt of the ancient Fathers and later iudicious and Orthodoxe Diuines take them. See §. 2. But deliuer vs from
euill.
               Q. What is the Summe of this Petition?
               
                  A. Our Sanctification. For as
the former did ſet out our Iuſtification,
ſo doth this our Sanctification:
vnder which two heads all our ſpirituall
good to be expected in this
world,Ideo quìppe ait, Sed libera, non ait, Et libera, tanquam vnam petitionem eſſe demonſtrans. Aug. in Enchir. cap. 16. is compriſed.
               Q. Of how many parts doth this
Petition conſiſt?
               
                  A. Of two. The firſt is in theſe
words, And leade vs not into temptation:
which importeth a preuenting of
euill feared. The other is in theſe
words,Quod ille in vltimo poſuit, Sed libera nos à malo, iſte non poſuit, vt intelligeremus ad illud ſuperius quod de tentatione dictū eſt pertinere. Aug. ibid. 
                  But deliuer vs from euill: which
implyeth a Recouering from euill fallen
out. So as our deſire in this Petition
is, that God would be ſo farre from
giuing vs ouer, like a iuſt and ſeuere
Iudge, into the power of the executioners
of his wrath, as rather, like
a pitifull and mercifull father, if at

any time wee bee ouer-taken by
them, he would reſcue and deliuer
vs.
               
                  Q. What points are to be conſidered in the firſt part?
               
                  A. 1. The Matter whereabout it is made, Temptation.
               
               2. The Action which is prayed againſt, Leade not into.
               
               3. The Perſon to whom the deprecation is directed.
               4. The Parties on whoſe behalfe it is made. Vs.
               
            
            
               §. 170. Of Temptation, and Tempters.
               
                  Q. WHat is Temptation?
               
               
                  A. In generall it is a proofe or triall: as the

                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      in Piel probare. Inde 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      probatio, tentatio. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      conatus. Inde 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      &amp; 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Et inde 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      tentatio. notation of the word in both the originall languages doth
ſhew. Dauid therefore ioyneth theſe two words together,
Pſal. 95. 9. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   
                  tempted, proued: which theHeb. 3. 9. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                  . Apoſtle tranſlateth by two diſtinct
words, whereof one ſignifieth to tempt, the other to proue.
And another Apoſtle applyeth the word commonly put for
temptation to that proofe and triall which is made by fierie perſecution
(1. Pet. 4. 12.) Thinke it not ſtrange (ſaith he) concerning
the fierie triall, which befalleth you
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  for temptation: which is to
trie you.
               
               
                  Temptation then generally or indefinitely conſidered is of an
indifferent nature: nor ſimply good, nor ſimply euill: but good
as it is well vſed: euill as it is ill vſed. It is therefore in Scripture
attributed toExod. 16. 4. God, from whom nothing but that which is
good can come, and to the1. Theſ. 3. 5. Diuell, from whom proceedeth
nothing but that which is euill: and alſo to men who ſometimes
are guidedReu. 2. 2. by the Spirit of God, and ſometimesMat. 22. 18. by the
ſpirit of Satan.
               
                  Temptation, when it is attributed to God is to be taken in the
beſt ſence: and that to proue, diſcouer, &amp; make knowne what is
in man: as Moſes ſaid to Iſrael,Deut. 8. 2. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   
                  Thou ſhalt remember the way which
the Lord thy God led thee to tempt thee (or to proue thee) to know
what was in thine heart.
                  Quod ſcriptum eſt, tentat vos dominus deus veſter, vt ſciat ſi diligatis cum, illa locutione poſitum eſt, vt ſciat, pro eo quod eſt vt ſcire vos faciat. Aug. de Serm. Dom. in monte. lib. 2. Not as if God were ignorant thereof (for
he vnderſtands our thoughts afarre off. Pſal. 139. 2.) but that he

God by tempting men maketh known, ſometimes ſuch graces
as are in them: (ſo heGen. 22. 1, 12. tempted Abraham:) and ſometimes ſuch
corruptions as lurk in them: ſo he2. Chro. 32. 31. tempted Hezekiah. Neither of
theſe temptations can be thought to be vniuſt, or any way euill.
               
                  Temptation when it is attributed to Satan is alwayes to bee
taken in the worſt ſence that can bee: for his temptations in
his intent are as bad as may be. The Diuels areMa

temptations to draw men in to ſinne. And becauſe hee neuer
ceaſeth ſo to tempt, by a kinde of property hee is called

(ſoMath. 4. 3. he tempted Chriſt) ſometimes mediately by his Meſſengers
(for a2 Cor. 12. 7. Meſſenger of Satan was ſent to tempt Paul) His
Meſſengers are of ſeuerall ſorts. Some with Syren-Songs, and
Dalilah delights lull men aſleepe (as Sampſon
                  Iudg. 16. 19. was lulled) and
bewitch them (as theGal. 3. 1. 
                  Galatians were bewitched:) Others
with thundring threats, and boiſterous buffets terrifie men, as
Ioh. 3. 2.—9. 22.—19 38. many of the Iewes were kept from making open profeſſion
of Chriſt by reaſon of the terrible Edicts that were made againſt
ſuch: and2. Tim 4. 16. Quocuaque me vertam nulla vſ quam ſecuritas eſt. &amp; quae mulcent, &amp; quae moleſtant limeo. Bern. Quadr. Serm. 6. Malleus caeleſtis opificis factus eſt, malleus vniuerſae ter

of the fierce perſecution raiſed againſt him. Hence hath riſen
the diſtinction of temptations on the right hand, and on the left
hand. All enticing allurements to wickedneſſe being counted
temptations on the right hand: and all violent diſcouragements
from goodneſſe being counted temptations on the left hand.
Thus doth Satan, as he thinkes may moſt make for his aduantage,
either inſencibly like a wily Serpent winde himſelfe into
men, or violently like a roaring Lyon, beare all before him.
Not vnfitly is he called the Creators maule: his maule for the
whole earth. He knocketh the Elect for their profit, he knocketh
downe the Reprobate vnto their perdition.
               
                  Temptation attributed to men muſt bee examined according
to their different kindes, and accordingly cenſured.
               Men tempt God, Themſelues and other men: all which may be
well or ill done.
               They may tempt God well, by making proofe of his power
and truth, for ſtrengthening of their faith, when they are called

to an extraordinarie worke (as in this caſeIudg. 6. 36, &amp;c. 
                  Gideon did) or haue
ſome extraordinarie promiſe made vnto them (as in this
caſe2. King. 20 8, &amp;c. 
                  Hezekiah did) or haue ſome ſpeciall warrant: in
which caſe becauſeIſa, 7. 11, &amp;c. 
                  Ahaz refuſed to tempt God, hee is
blamed.
               Men may euilly tempt God by preſuming too much, when
they haue no good ground and ſufficient warrant for their preſumption
(as theMath. 4 6, 7. Diuel would haue had Chriſt to haue done:
and as the1. Sam. 4. 3. Iſraelites did when they carried the Arke into the
Armie) or by an vndue doubting, and deſpairing of Gods helpe
in time of need (as theExod. 17. 2. Numb. 14. 22. Iſraelites oft did in the Wilderneſſe.)
Both theſe wayes did the Iſraelites tempt God after the Spies
returned from ſearching the Land of Canaan. For firſt thorow
deſpaire theyNumb. 14. 1, &amp;c. thought of returning backe againe to Egypt:
and being blamed for that, they fell into another extreme,
and—44. preſumptuouſly would needs goe againſt the Canaanites
without the Arke, and without Moſes their guide.
               2. Men tempt themſelues well, when they ſearch and examine
themſelues to finde out the ſecret corruptions of their
ſoules, or the truth and ſtrength of grace in them.2. Cor. 13. 5. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Hereunto
they are expreſſely exhorted. But they doe euilly tempt themſelues,
when by preſuming too much vpon their own ſtrength
they caſt themſelues into vnneceſſary dangers (asMat. 26. 35, 58. Ioh. 18. 18. 
                  Peter did)
or when by the inward corrupt motion of their own ſoule they
are entiſed and drawne vnto any euill,Iam. 1. 14. 
                  Euery man is tempted,
when hee is drawne away of his owne laſt, and entiſed.
               
               3. One man tempteth another well, when on iuſt ground
they aſſay to finde out ſome excellency in them (1. King. 10. 1. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   to which
end the Queene of Sheba came to Salomon to tempt him) or
elſe ſome hidden corruption in them; thus the Church of Epheſus
                  Reu. 2. 2. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  tempted them which ſaid they were Apoſtles, but
were not: and ſo found them lyars. But euilly doth one man
tempt another, when he enticeth him to ſinne (Gen. 39. 7, 10. whereunto Ioſephs
Miſtris tempted him) or when he aſſayeth to enſnare him,
and to bring him into any danger.Luk. 20. 20, 23 Thus the Miniſters of the
Phariſies tempted Chriſt.
               Theſe are the ſeuerall kinds of temptation mentioned in the
Scripture.
            
            
               
               §. 171. Of the kinde of temptation here meant.
               
                  Q. VVHat kinde of temptation is here meant?
               
                  A. Temptation vnto ſinne, whether it ariſe
from Satan, our ſelues, or other men.
               
                  Q. Is temptation to ſinne ſimply euill?
               
                  A. No: not in the party tempted, if he yeeld not thereto,
but reſiſt it:Math. 4. 9. For Chriſt, who was free from all ſin,Petimus ne alicui tentationi vel conſentiamus decepti, vel cedamus afflicti. Aug. Epiſt. 121. was tempted
vnto ſinne.
               Q. Why then are we taught to pray againſt it?
               
                  A. The principall thing againſt which wee are here taught
to pray is the power of that temptation, as is euident by this
Particle173. 
                  into. Yet great cauſe there is why we ſhould alſo pray
againſt the very act of temptation, that at all we be not tempted
to any ſinne, both becauſe the act it ſelfe is euill in them
that tempt to ſinne, and alſo becauſe by nature wee are as
prone to yeeld to euery euill whereunto we are tempted, as dry
Tinder is apt to be ſet on fire by euery ſparke that falleth vpon
it:Gen. 6. 5. For Euery imagination of the thoughts of mans heart is onely
euill continually. Herein lyeth a maine difference betwixt the
quality of Chriſts humane nature, and ours. His was ſo perfectly
pure as no temptation could faſten vpon it. It was to
temptation as a ſea of water to ſparkes of fire, which ſoone
extinguiſheth them. Ours is as dry Tinder, yea as dry Gunpowder.

                  ction to temptation.
               
                  Q. WHat obſeruation may bee gathered from the mention of
temptation in this deprecation?
               
                  A. Men in this world are continually ſubiect to temptations.
                  Rom. 7. 21.
This complaint of the Apoſtle, (I finde a law that when I would
doe good, euill is preſent with mee: and, O wretched man that I
am, who ſhall deliuer mee from the body of this death?) verifieth
as much: ſo alſo doth wofull experience in all men. If there bee
a man that findes not this true in himſelfe, his caſe is deſperate:
for either hee is depriued of all ſpirituall vnderſtanding and

ſence, that he is not able to diſcerne a temptation: or his whole
courſe of life is ſo full of temptations, and hee ſuch a ſlaue to
them, they ſo frequent on him, and he ſo free towards them, as
hee cannot ſee the wood for trees. He cannot tell when he is
tempted, becauſe he is neuer but tempted. Temptations are not
as enemies to him to be reſiſted: but as his beſt friends to haue
the beſt entertainment that hee can afford vnto them. Thus a
man accounting temptations to be no temptations may in his
owne imagination be free: but indeed no man is free.

Man in regard of ſpirituall ſtrength is as weake as water which
cannot vphold it ſelfe but runneth all about: without grace he

hee be left to himſelfe, how can hee ſtand againſt a temptation.

                  A. No verily. It is the greateſt blaſphemie that
can be to auouch, or conceit any ſuch thing of God.

blacke, not darkneſſe to light, not death to life, as ſinne to God.

kinde of impoſſibilitie that can be) It is impoſſible that God
ſhould ſinne,Why it is impoſſible that God ſhould be acceſſarie to ſinne. or be a cauſe, or Author of ſinne. This we ought
to beleeue and profeſſe, 1. becauſe his ſupreme and abſolute
power is ſuch as it ought not to bee called into queſtion. Is
it fit to ſay to a King, thou art wicked? and to Princes, ye are
vngodly?
                  Iob 34. 18, 19. 
                  how much leſſe to him that accepteth not the perſon of
Princes, &amp;c? 2. becauſe the perfection of his puritie is ſuch
as it admitteth no mixture.1. Ioh. 1. 5. 
                  God is light, and in him is no darkneſſe
at all.
                  Iam. 1. 17. 3. Becauſe he is the originall fountaine of all goodneſſe:Iam. 3. 11.
ſo as if this principle (doth a fountaine ſend forth at the
ſame place ſweet water and bitter?) bee infallibly true of any
fountaine, it is without contradiction moſt true of this originall
fountaine. On theſe and other like grounds, wee may
well know that God hath power to giue, with-hold, or withdraw
what hee will, and when hee will: and to ſupport or
forſake whom hee will: and that he is not bound to that law
which hee hath ſet to his creatures, nor to giue an account to
any. Yea we ought to acknowledge God to bee as moſt pure
in his nature, ſo moſt iuſt in all his counſels, words and workes:
and if wee cannot fully and clearely vnderſtand how the forenamed
actions concerning leading into temptation can bee attributed
vnto God, and yet God freed from all acceſſarineſſe
to ſinne, to lay our hands vpon our mouthes, and to aſcribe
it to the ſhallowneſſe of our owne apprehenſion: but no way
to charge God with folly or ſinne. Among the Principles
which without all gaine-ſaying ought to bee beleeued, this
is one of the prime,Pſal. 5. 4. that the Lord is a God that hath no pleaſure

in wickedneſſe: hee can no way be acceſſarie thereto. But
beſides this abſolute ſoueraignty and perfect puritie of God,
other particular reaſons of Gods dealing with men in this
kinde may bee giuen, and thoſe ſo clearely iuſt and equall, as
any one, but ſuch an one as is blinded in his minde by the god
of this world, may diſcerne the iuſtice and equitie thereof.
For
               1. Where God permitteth Tempters to tempt men,The ends of all Gods actions moſt iuſt, it is
for good and iuſt ends, as to try and proue mens faith, courage,
wiſedome, patience, and other like graces, all which
were by this meanes proued to bee ſound and great in Iob:
                  Deut. 13. 3.
or elſe to diſcouer their weakeneſſe and ſecret wickedneſſe, that
they may neither bee too ſecure, nor ouerbold and ſelfe-conceited.
By this meanes and for theſe ends wasMat. 26. 33, &amp;c 
                  Peters weakeneſſe
diſcouered.
               2. Where God biddeth,God ſendeth tempters as a iuſt Iudge. ſendeth or inſtigateth Tempters
to tempt men, as in the caſes of1. Kin 22, 20. 
                  Ahab, of theRom. 1 24, 26. 
                  Gentiles,
and of2. Theſ. 2. 11, 12. 
                  Antichriſtians, it is as a iuſt iudge to puniſh former
tranſgreſſions, ſo as theſe Tempters are therein executioners
of Gods iuſtice.
               3. Where God leaueth men to themſelues, and withholdeth
his aſſiſtance,God with-holds his aſſiſtance to make man know himſelfe. it is to giue euident demonſtration that
man without God is nothing: no more able to ſtand of himſelfe
then a child that is new-borne. Now there is great need
that man ſhould bee euidently conuicted hereof,2. Chro. 32, 31. leſt hee be
too preſumptuous of his owne ſtrength, and neglect God.
               4. Where God with-draweth his Spirit, or any grace
from man,Mat. 4. 25. it is as a iuſt puniſhment for abuſe thereof. In this
reſpect God tooke away his Spirit from Saul.
                  Mat. 25, 28. Compare 1. Sam.
10 9. &amp; 11. 6. with 1. Sam. 16. 14.
               To conclude this point,God turnes all to good. ſo farre is God from being any way
acceſſarie to ſinne by leading into temptation, as contrarily he turneth
the euill thereof vnto good.2. Cor. 4. 6. For as at firſt he brought light
out of darkneſſe, ſo euer ſince by his Almightie power, vnſearchable
wiſedome, and perfect puritie hath he brought good out of
euill. Good to himſelfe, by making the glorie of his iuſtice in puniſhing,
of his pittie in ſuccouring, of his power in ſupporting,
of his faithfulneſſe in deliuering, of his wiſedome in catching

the ſubtill in their owne craftineſſe, and diſappointing their
plots and practiſes, and of other his properties to ſhine forth
the brighter. Good alſo to his Saints, as Ioſeph ſaid to his brethren,
Ye thought euill againſt me,
                  Gen 50. 20. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   
                  but God meant (or diſpoſed) it vnto
good. Thus though the temptation be euill, yet God is good
euen in leading into temptation.

                  Q. WHat doctrines doth praying vnto God, not to leade
vs into temptation, teach vs?Fruſtra rogantes deum dicimus, ne nos inducas in tentalionem, ſi hoc in noſtra poſi tum ſit poteſtate. Aug. Epiſt. 89.
               
               A. 1. Man is not able of himſelfe to ſtand againſt
temptations. If he were, what cauſe of feare had he to bee
lead into temptation? The Prophet well knew this, who ſaid,
Ier. 10, 23. 
                  O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himſelfe
                        •
                     it is not in man
that walketh to direct his ſteps: and the Apoſtle, who ſaid,2. Cor. 3. 5. 
                  Wee
are not ſufficient of our ſelues to thinke any thing of our ſelues. If man
cannot direct his ſteps, nor of himſelfe thinke any thing, can he
withſtand all tempters, &amp; keepe himſelfe from all temptations?
               This diſabilitie is come vpon vs by ſinne, which hath depriued
vs of all that ſpirituall ſtrength which God at our firſt
creation gaue vs.How man came to be diſabled. ForEccl. 7. 31. 
                  God made man righteous, euenGen. 1. 27. 
                  after his
owne image: by vertue whereof man had power to remaine ſtedfaſt
in that eſtate, and to withſtand all Tempters, ſo, as not to be
ouer-come with any temptation: onely that power was left to
his owne power and free will: which he abuſing, voluntarily
yealded to the temptation of Satan, and depriued himſelfe of
all ſpirituall ſtrength and life: and now by nature isEphe. 2. 1. 
                  dead in
ſinne: no way able to reſiſt any temptation further then God
doth giue him grace and ſtrength ſo to do. Therefore he ſaith
not, without me ye can do little, but, nothing.

Temptations.
               
                  Q. VVHat other doctrine maybe gathered from this deprecation
directed to God?
               A. God hath an ouer-ruling hand in all temptations.
                  Potens eſt dominus qui abſtulit peccatum veſti
                        ••
                      &amp; delicta veſtra donaui
                        •
                     , tueri &amp; cuſtodire vos aduerſum diaboli aduerſantis inſidias. Aug. de verb. Dom. c. 28.
The Lord who hath taken away your ſinne, and pardoned
your offences, can preſerue and keepe you from the wiles
of your aduerſarie the diuell. He can either keepe vs ſafe from
all: or he can giue vs ouer into the power of euery one. Otherwiſe
there would not be ſuch cauſe of flying to him in time of
temptation, as in this Petition is implyed. But true is that of
Saint Peter, The Lord knoweth how to deliuer the godly out of temptations:
and this of Saint Paul, God is faithfull, who will not ſuffer
you to be tempted aboue that you are able.
                  2. Pet. 2. 9.
               
               As the ſupreme ſoueraigntie and abſolute power which God
hath ouer all creatures doth euidently proue the point (For
who hath reſiſted his will?
                  1. Cor. 10. 13. If he ſay to a Tempter go, he goeth: or
come,
                  Gods power ouer tempters. he commeth: or do this, he doth it.) ſo the care which he
taketh of his Church to prouide for it,Rom. 9. 19. to protect it, to keepe
it ſafe from all dangers,Mat. 8. 9. and to bring it to reſt and glorie in heauen,
doth ſhew the reaſon why he retaineth an ouer-ruling hand
in all temptations.Gods care ouer his Church. Though in wiſedome he ſuffer tempters to
aſſault his children, yet he will order the aſſault ſo as it ſhall not
preuaile againſt them, no nor turne to their damage, but rather
to their aduantage: for the effecting whereof he holds the raines
in his owne hands, to let them looſe, or hold them in, as hee
ſeeth cauſe.2. King. 19. 28. That which God ſaid to Semacherib, (I will put my

hooke in thy noſe, and my bridle in thy lips) he doth to all the tempters
of his Church. This care of God ouer his Church the
Pſalmiſt doth thus excellently ſet forth in theſe words,Pſal. 105. 14, 15 
                  He ſuffered
no man to do them wrong, yea he reprooued Kings for their ſakes,
ſaying, Touch not mine annointed, and do my Prophets no
harme.
               
               Learne we hereby in all temptations,Truſt in God▪ &amp; feare him more then tempters. and in all ſtraits, whereunto
thereby we are brought, to looke vnto God, (as Iehoſaphat
did,2. Chro. 20. 12. when by reaſon of the multitude of his mightie enemies he
knew not what to do,Qui deo ſe committit diabolum non timet. Aug. loc. citat.) and to feare God more then them which
tempt vs: for on this ground we may with confidence ſay, The
Lord is my helper, I will not feare what any Tempter can do. For
there may be ſure and ſafe defence from all thoſe euils which
Satan doth plot and practiſe againſt vs,Heb. 13. 6. if God deliuer vs.A cunctis aduerſis quae contra nos molitur ini. micus poteſt eſſe fida &amp; firma tutelo, ſi nos deus liberet. Cypr. de Orat. Dom. §. 19.
               
            
            
               §. 179. Of the reſtraint of the power of
Tempters.
               
                  Q. VVHat third Doctrine doth the direction of this deprecation
vnto God teach vs?
               A. The power of ſuch as tempt vs is limited. This is euident by
the reſtraint of the arch-tempter Satan, who ſetteth all on
worke,Reu. 20. 23. euen he, when God pleaſed, was bound a thouſand yeares.
And though he deſired to haue the diſciples,
                     See the whole Armour of God Treat. 1. Part. 3. §. 22. in Eph. 6. 12. that he might ſift
them as wheate, yet could he not, as he deſired, preuaile ouer
them. Something hee did: but hee came farre ſhort of his
deſire.
               By this meanes the Lord giueth euident proofe that his power
extendeth it ſelfe ouer the moſt mightie and malicious enemies
that his Church hath:Gods enemies forced to ſee his power. and forceth them to ſay, This is the
finger of God.
                  Exod. 8. 19. Yea by this meanes his Church euen in this world
is kept ſafe,The Church kept ſafe. ſo as the gates of hell cannot preuaile againſt it. For if
Satan and his inſtruments had power to do what they will,Math. 16. 18. the
whole Church ſhould ſoone be deuoured.1. Pet. 5 8. 
                  Her aduerſarie the diuell,
like a roaring Lyon, walketh about, ſeeking whom to deuoure.
               
               We all who are members of the true Church,Encouragemēt againſt temptations. though euen
in that reſpect we are the more tempted and aſſaulted, haue iuſt

cauſe to reioyce, and to comfort and encourage our ſelues againſt
the many temptations of Sathan, and other tempters.
Though they deſire and ſeeke our vtter ruine, yet are they reſtrained:
they cannot at cheiue what they deſire and ſeeke. They
are like to a fierce maſty dog that is chained, and can go no further
then to the length of his chaine. On this ground the Lord
giueth this aduice,Reu. 2. 10. 
                  Feare none of theſe things which thou ſhalt ſuffer:
behold the diuell ſhall caſt ſome of you into priſon, that you may
be tried: and yee ſhall haue tribulation ten daies, &amp;c. The particular
number (Some of you, not all) The kinde of perſecution
(caſt into priſon, not, put to the ſword) and the determinate
time (ten daies not perpetually) doe all imply a reſtraint: and
thereupon he inferreth his exhortation, Feare none of thoſe things,
&amp;c. on the ſame ground Chriſt hauing foretold his Diſciples
that in the world they ſhould haue tribulation,Iohn 16. 33. addeth this encouragement,
be of good cheare, I haue ouer-come the world.
               
               This reſtraint of the power of tempters doth further miniſter
iuſt occaſion of praiſing God,Bleſſe God for reſtaining tēpters. and ſaying, Bleſſed bee the
Lord:
                  Pſal. 124. 6, 7. 
                  who hath not giuen vs as a prey to their teeth. Our ſoule is
eſcaped as a bird out of the ſnare of the foulers: the ſnare is broken,
and we are deliuered. Fitly, to enforce the equity of this duty, I
may apply to our preſent purpoſe, that which Chriſt ſaid of the
fierce perſecution of the Iewes, Except the tempters power
were limited,Mat. 24. 22. 
                  there ſhould no fleſh be ſaued; but for the Elects ſake
it is reſtrained.

               The ſnares alſo which tempters lay,1 Tim. 6. 9. 
                  drowne men in perdition
and deſtruction, if they be faſt held thereby. And if they preuaile
againſt ſome; they will be the more bold to ſet on others, as
Senacherib who by the victories which he had got againſt other
nations was ſo fleſhed, as he thought God could not deliuer Ieruſalem
out of his hands. Thus by the aduantages which Satan
getteth againſt others,2 King. 18. 33. &amp;c. wee our ſelues are in great danger.
               The zeale therefore which we ought to haue of Gods glory,
The loue we owe to our brethren, and the care which lyeth on
vs for our owne ſafetie, require that we ſeeke others ſpirituall
freedome as well as our owne.

common enemies that thou haſt, and by reaſon thereof are in

when thou haſt found ſome aſſiſtance againſt them or freedome

the houre of his triall and temptation. Expreſſely it is ſaid of
him,Heb. 2. 18. 
                  In that he himſelfe hath ſuffered being tempted, hee is able to
ſuccour them that are tempted. Though we haue not ſuch power
to ſuccour, yet according to our power wee ought to haue ſuch
a minde.
            
            
               
               §. 181. Of that ſubiection wherein Saints are
to Temptations.
               Q. VVHat inſtruction doth the relation of this particle vs
to the Preface, teach vs?
               
                  A. Gods children are not exempted from temptations. They
who call God Father, and who teſtifie their due reſpect to him,
are taught to pray againſt temptations, which were not needfull
to be taught, if they were not ſubiect thereto. Runne thorow
the Scripture, obſerue the liues of thoſe Saints which are there
recorded, and you ſhall finde the Doctrine abundantly proued.
Take one example, which may be in ſteede of all. Chriſt the deareſt
of Gods children, the Sonne of his loue, in whom his ſoule
delighted, was oft ſoarely tempted, both byMat. 4. 1, &amp;c. 
                  Satan himſelfe,
and alſo by hisMat. 16. 1.—22. 18. 
                  inſtruments. If hereupon it be demanded, what
the priuiledge of Saints ouer and aboue the wicked is in regard
of temptation, I anſwer, very great: both in that they are aſſured
of1 Cor. 10. 13. 
                  ſufficient ſtrength, ſo as they ſhall not be vanquiſhed by
any:Rom. 8. 28. and alſo that euery temptation ſhall in the iſſue turne vnto
their good.

them wiſe, watchfull, and euer well prepared by temptations.
BeſidesReu. 12. 4. 
                  Satans greateſt malice is againſt them.
               It is therefore no good inference which many make, that
God is angry with them, and loueth them not, that hee is not
their Father,God is not angry with all that are tempted. nor they his children, becauſe hee ſuffereth them
to be tempted. This was the inference which the friends of Iob
made of his trialls and temptations. ButIob. 42. 7. Gods owne cenſure
of their diſputation ſheweth the non-conſequence thereof. The
truth is, that they who finde themſelues wholy freed from
temptations haue moſt cauſe to doubt of Gods fatherly loue to
them, and care ouer them. The Apoſtle pronounceth ſuch to be
Heb. 12. 8. 
                  baſtards, and not ſons. If wee well conſider the eſtate of the
Church,Si inagnum illud eccleſiae corpus conſiderare libet, facile ſatis aduertimus, longè acrius impugnari ſpirituale, viros ipſius eccleſiae, quam carnales. Bern in Pſal. 91. Serm 7. we may ſoone finde that ſuch as are ſpirituall are much
more feircely aſſaulted then ſuch as are carnall. The more ſure

Satan is of any, the more quiet, and ſecure he ſuffers them to be.
A Lyon runneth and roareth after that prey which is out of his

               §. 182. Of the freeneſſe of mans will in ſinne.
               Q. VVHat may bee obſerued from the relation of the parties
tempted to the action of leading into temptation?
               
                  A. Man is not forced to ſinne. For it is implied that if man
yeeld not,Qui dueitur vo lens ducitur. the tempter can haue no power ouer him. Hee that
is led goeth along with him that leadeth him.lam, 1. 14. 
                  Euery man is
tempted when he is drawne away of his owne luſts and is entiſed. This
phraſe (own luſts) implyeth a voluntary yealding. On this ground
are the exhortations in Scripture made to men toIam. 4. 7. 
                  reſiſt the
diuel, and toEph. 4. 27. 
                  giue no place to him. Whereby is implyed that if we
ſtand againſt him,Sine voluntate nullum eſt peccatum. Aug. Retract. l. 2. c. 15. Naturae human
                        •
                      nec ſubſtantia erepta eſt in illa vniuerſalis praeuaricationis ruina, nec v
                        •
                     luntas, lumen decuſque vir tutum. Amb. in Luc. lib. 7. he cannot preuaile againſt vs. Many like exhortations
are giuen to withſtand, and not to yeald vnto other
tempters, as the world and the fleſh.
               Sin is of the will, which cannot bee forced. Though the will
by Adams fall hath loſt all that liberty and freedome to good
which it had by creation, and by corruption is made a ſlaue to
ſinne: yet as the minde retaineth vnderſtanding, ſo the will freedome.
For freedome is as eſſentiall to the will, as vnderſtanding
is to the minde. IndeedeGen. 6. 5. the corrupt will of man can will
nothing but that which is euill: yet the euill which it willeth,
it willeth freely, and is not forced thereto. Freedome of will is
not oppoſed to reſtraint in one kinde, but to conſtraint in that
kinde:Liberum arbitrium captiuatum nō niſi ad peccā
                     dum valet. Aug. contr. Epiſt. Pelag. l. 3. c. 8. to compulſion &amp; coaction. The wil of Dieuls is reſtrained
to euil, they cannot will good, but euill only: yet the euill which
they will they will freely and willingly: they are not conſtrained
and compelled thereto. Yea Gods will, which is moſt
abſolutely free,Wherein freedome of will conſiſteth. is reſtrained to one kinde, which is good. He
hath not in his will a liberty to euill. To will euill is againſt the

perfection of his wil. Wherfore though the wil haue not a liberty
to chooſe either of the contrary parts, good or euil, yet a freedome
and willingneſſe it retaineth in that whereunto it yealdeth:
it neither is,The meanes whereby Satan tempteth. nor can be conſtrained thereto. All that
Sathan doth or can doe, is by ſome meanes or other to moue
men to yeeld to that whereunto he tempteth them. Whereupon
faith the Apoſtle,2. Cor. 11. 3. 
                  I feare leſt by any meanes as the Serpent beguiled
Eue through his ſubtilty, ſo your mindes ſhould be corrupted,
&amp;c. To effect this the old wily Serpent hath many and manifold
meanes. Some inward, ſome outward.
               Inward meanes are ſuch as delight, or affright men. Hee
worketh delight by ſtirring vp their corrupt humours and ſo
inclineth their will to his temptation. Thus hee ſtirred vp the
corrupt humor of pride in Dauid, and thereby1. Chro. 21. 1. 
                  proucked him
to number Iſrael: and the corrupt humor of couetouſneſſe in
Iudas, in which reſpect hee is ſaid toLuke 22. 3. 
                  enter into him. The
meanes which in this kinde Sathan vſeth are drawne to
three heads:
               
                  1. Ioh. 2. 16. expounded. 1. The luſt of the fleſh: which is voluptuouſneſſe, whereby
the fleſh is ſo tickled and delighted as it draweth the will to
any thing.2. Tim. 3. 4. Such perſons the Apoſtle ſtileth louers of pleaſures
more then louers of God.
               
               2. The luſt of the eyes, which is couetouſneſſe. A couetouſe
man is euen rauiſhed at the ſight of wealth. When Achan ſaw
ſiluer,Ioſ. 7. 21. gold, and other pretious things in Iericho, he coueted them
and tooke them, though they were accurſed. There is not a thing
of price which a couetous man caſteth his eye vpon, but inſtantly
he coueteth it, and ſo doteth thereon, as hee will doe any
thing to haue it.
               3. Pride of life, which is ambition, and vaine affectation of
the honours and promotions of this life. This puffeth vp aboue
their mortall condition, as is euident in the examples ofEſt. 3. 5. &amp;c. 
                  Haman,
                  Pan. 4. 27. 
                  Nebuchadnezzar,
                  Ezek. 28. 2. 
                  Tyrus, andAct. 12. 22, 23 
                  Herod. Such,Pſal. 10. 4. 
                  thorow
their pride, will not ſeeke after God.
               
               As by theſe pleaſing temptations Satan allureth ſo, by inward
feares, frights, and terrors he draweth others to yeeld to
him, asIob. 1. 11.—2. 5. hee aſſayed to draw Iob: and as heeIoh. 7. 13.—9. 22. preuailed with
many of the people in Chriſts time.
               
                  
The outward meanes which hee vfeth are ſuch externall obiects
as he conceiueth to bee agreeable to their humour, and
therefore ſetteth them before them, (as he ſet before Chriſt all
the Kingdomes of the world and the glory of them:
                  Math. 4. 8.) or ſuch as he
conceiueth to be of force to terrifie them, as are all manner of
troubles and afflictions. Thus it is ſaid that the Diuell caſt ſome
of Smyrna,
                  Reu. 2. 10. 
                  into priſon. Whether the meanes which are vſed
to draw men to ſinne be faire or foule, by none of them is the
will forced: but only moued to yeeld it ſelfe to the temptation.
               This point affordeth two vſefull directions.The blame of ſinne to be laid vpon ones ſelfe. One is in regard
of ſinnes paſt to iudge our ſelues for them, and vpon our ſelues
to lay the whole blame: and not to thinke it a ſufficient excuſe
to lay the blame vpon any other. Many will ſay when they are
taken in ſome notorious ſinne, The Diuell owed mee a ſpight,
and now hath paid mee it, thinking thereby to extenuate their
ſinne;Gen. 3. 13. which conceit Eue had, when ſhee ſaid, The Serpent beguiled
mee. And if any man haue beene any occaſion of their
ſinne,—12. they will lay the blame vpon them, as Adam did vpon
Eue. But had they beene reſolute in their owne will, nor
Satan, nor any of his inſtruments could haue made them to
ſinne. They who thus thinke to ſhift off ſinne, doe bring the
greater load vpon their owne ſoules. For this keepes them
from that degree of humiliation and contritionIſa. 66. 2. which would
moue God to pitie them. When men in truth lay loade on
themſelues,Math. 11. 28. God is ready to eaſe them. For to ſuch as Labour
and are heauy loaden Chriſt ſaith, Come vnto mee, I will giue you
reſt. But on ſuch as by the ſhifting of ſinne thinke to eaſe
themſelues, God will lay loade. WhatMath. 23. 13. loades of woe did
Chriſt lay vpon the hypocriticall Scribes and Phariſies, who
put off all burdens from themſelues? What a loade was laid
on1. Sam. 15. 20, 21, 22, 23. 
                  Saul, that by mincing his ſinne ſought to eaſe himſelfe?
and2. Sam. 12 13 what eaſe was giuen to Dauid, that laid the burden of ſin
vpon himſelfe?Vera confeſſions, non falſa defenſione opus habet. Aug. de Nat. &amp; gra c. 53. Now whether it be ſafeſt ſo to ſhift off ſin, as to
prouoke God to lay the burden of it on vs, or ſo to burden our
ſelues as to moue God to eaſe vs, iudge you. Is there not now
more need of true confeſſion, then falſe iuſtification.
               The other direction is in regard of ſuch ſinnes as wee are
tempted vnto,Be reſolute againſt yeelding to tempters. but haue not yeelded vnto, that we take courage

and boldneſſe to our ſelues, and, with a reſolued purpoſe neuer
to yeeld, reſiſt the temptation. Mans will, if he ſtand ſtoutly,
and yeeld not, is an impregnable fort. Satan muſt by ſome
meanes or other, faire or foule, bring a man to yeeld vp his
fort, before he can enter into it. What ſtronger motiue to reſiſt,
to ſtand out, to hearken to no parlie, to endure the vtter-moſt
aſſault, then this? Wherefore in this ſpirituall combate againſt
temptations,1 Cor. 16. 13.

ſtrong.

                  Q. VVHat Doctrine ariſeth from the expreſſe mention of euill
in this deprecation?In nouiſſimis ponimus, ſed libera nos à malo, comprehendentes aduerſa cuncta. Cypr. de Orat. Dom. §. 19.
               
               
                  A. Euill is the onely thing to be prayed againſt. Obſeruantly
marke all the deprecations mentioned in Scripture, and by a
particular induction of them you ſhall finde this generall poſition
abundantly proued. Take one inſtance which may be inſteed
of all, becauſe it is the beſt of all, that which Chriſt made a
little before his death, I pray not (ſaith Chriſt to his Father) that
thou ſhould'ſt take them out of the world,
                  Ioh. 17. 15. 
                  but that thou ſhould'ſt
keepe them from the EVILL.
               
                  Euill is the venime,By euill, things come to bee hurtfull. the poiſon, the ſting, that maketh any
thing to be hurtfull. Euill is it that makes ſo great a difference,
as there is, betwixt Angels and Angels, Men and Men, Actions
and Actions, Temptations and Temptations: ſome are good
ſome are euill. No oppoſits are more directly contrary one to
another then good and euill. As nothing therefore but that
which is good is to be prayed for, ſo nothing but that which is
euill is to be prayed againſt.
               
               Learne hence wiſely to obſerue what is euill in any thing,Obſerue what is euill in any thing.
and accordingly pray againſt it: yea as it is more or more euill,
ſo more inſtantly and earneſtly pray againſt it. Of all euils ſinne
is the greateſt: greateſt in the kinde and nature of it: greateſt
alſo in the effects and fruits of it. It is the cauſe of all euill. Nothing
but that which is effected or infected by it, is euill. The

diuell, the world, wicked men, and other creatures of God
which are ſtiled euill, are infected therewith. All manner of
puniſhments and paines which are indeed euill, whether temporall,
ſpirituall, or eternall are cauſed by it. Of all other euils
this ought moſt of all to be prayed againſt. All things alſo that
are cauſes hereof, or occaſions hereto are to bee prayed againſt,
as being in this reſpect euill. ThusMat. 26. 41. temptations, andPro. 38. 8. Afflictions how they are matter of deprecation and thankſgiuing. afflictions
are to be prayed againſt: not ſimply and abſolutely: for
Iam. 1. 2. Saint Iames willeth vs to account it all ioy, when we fall into diuers
temptations: and theActs 5. 41. Apoſtles reioyced in their ſufferings: yea
Iob 1. 21. 
                  Iob expreſſely bleſſeth God for taking away, as well as for giuing.
For by the good and wiſe prouidence of God, temporall croſſes
doe oft turne to our good and profit.Pſal. 119. 71. 
                  It is good for me that I
haue bene afflicted (ſaith the Pſalmiſt)Heb. 12. 10. 
                  God chasteneth vs for our
profit (ſaith the Apoſtle.) In regard of this fruite which by the
ouer-ruling prouidence of God, ariſeth out of afflictions they
are indeed matter of thankſgiuing, when God doth ſo order
them: and therefore they are not ſimply and abſolutely to bee
prayed againſt. Yet becauſe through the weakeneſſe of our
fleſh they oft cauſe diſcontent, impatiencie and other ſinnes (in
which reſpect they are euill) ſo farre forth as they cauſe any
ſuch euill effect they may be prayed againſt: at leaſt we muſt
pray that they bring not forth any ſinne in vs. Thus are wee to
pray againſt companie keeping, againſt feaſting, againſt pleaſures
and paſtimes, and againſt all other things that are vſuall
occaſions of ſinne. Yea againſt the abuſe of euerie good thing.
For the abuſe of a good thing is euill. And becauſe wicked
men are oft made Satans inſtruments of working much euill,
wee may alſo pray againſt all their euill plots and practiſes,
not againſt their perſons: they are to be prayed for (except
we know them to haue ſinned againſt the holy Ghoſt,
or to be vtterly reiected of God, or haue ſome particular warrant,
as the Prophets oft had, not to pray for them.) More directly
wee are to pray againſt all ſp
                     •
                  rituall iudgements, which
are not onely puniſhments of ſinnes, but ſinnes themſelues, as
hardneſſe of heart, errour of iudgement, inordinate luſts, deſpaire,
and ſuch like. Theſe are directly euill. Thus are wee to
pray againſt eternall damnation, a dreadfull euill. Finally,

though Satan bee not the onely euill here meant, yet is hee an
eſpeciall and principall euill one.

                  A. 1. By keeping away that euill which is readie
to fall vpon him.Exod. 14. 13. Thus were the Iſraelites deliuered
from the hoaſt of the Egyptians that eagerly purſued them.
               2. By aſſiſting him on whom the euill is fallen, ſo as he is not

ouerwhelmed,A malo deus liberat, quando ſuper id quod poſſumus, non nos permit

               §. 187. Of that hope of recouerie which remaineth
to them that fall.
               
                  Q. VVHat doctrine may be gathered from praying for deliuerance?
               A. There is hope of recouerie to ſuch as are fallen. For deliuerance
from euill preſuppoſeth a fail into euill: and prayer for this deliuerance
implyeth that we may be recouered out of it. This is
verified as by manifeſt experience of many Saints that in all ages
haue bene recouered,Pro. 24. 16. ſo by this approued Prouerbe. A iuſt
man falleth ſeuen times and riſeth vp againe: which though it bee
principally intended of affliction, yet may it alſo be extended
to ſinne.
               The ground of this hope ariſeth from God himſelfe:Reaſons. euen
from his mercie,
                  1. Gods pittie. (whereby he is moued to pittie his children in
all their miſeries:Lam. 3. 22. whereupon ſaith the Prophet, It is of the Lords
mercies that we are not conſumed, becauſe his compaſſions faile not:)
and from his power (whereby he is able to helpe them whom he
pittieth:2. Gods power. whereupon ſaith the Apoſtle,Rom. 11. 23. of the Iewes, They alſo,
if they abide not ſtill in vnbeliefe ſhall be graffed in: for God is able
to graffe them in againe.)3. Gods truth. And from his truth, for he that is faithfull
and will do it,
                  1. Theſ. 5. 24. hath made many promiſes of deliuerance.
               
                  
This point concerneth ſuch as ſtand,Comfort to feeble. &amp; ſuch as are fallen. In
regard of this hope of recouerie they which ſtand ought to comfort
the feeble minded,
                  1. Theſ. 5. 14. who are troubled with feares of vtter deſertion,
as if God were implacable, and irreconciliable towards
them that are at any time ouercome by any temptation. The
caueat which Chriſt gaue to Peter, is to be practiſed by all that
haue any ſpirituall ſtrength,Luke 22. 32. 
                  Strengthen thy brethren. Yea alſo they
ought in the ſpirit of meekeneſſe to reſtore ſuch an one.
                  Gal. 6. 1.
               
               As for thoſe which are fallen,Who fallen, riſe againe. they are taught not to deſpaire,
but to ſay as the Spirit teacheth them, Come, let vs returne vnto
the Lord: for he hath torne, and he will heale vs:
                  Oſe 6. 1. 
                  hee hath ſmitten
and he will binde vs vp: and withall not to continue in Satans
ſnares, but to do what they can to come out of the ſame,Reu. 2. 5. according
to that pithie perſwaſion of the Lord, Remember from
whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the firſt workes.

               Were not God able and willing to deliuer, why ſhould this

How long doeſt thou forget me, and doeſt not deliuer me in the time of
trouble? To thee, ô Ladie, do I lift vp my ſoule, let not the ſnares of
death preuaile againſt me. In thee, ô Ladie, haue I hoped, let me not be
confounded for euer. O thou bleſſed Ladie, in thy hands our ſaluation
is laid vp. Haue we not now iuſt cauſe to crie out againſt them,
as the Prophet Ieremiah did againſt the idolatrous Iewes, and
ſay,m 
                  Be aſtoniſhed, ô ye heauens, at this, and be horribly afraid: for
my people haue committed two euils: they haue forſaken me the fountaine

that can hold no water. 180, 181.

Hereof ſee §.
               The meaning of the Petition being opened, the order is next to bee
conſidered.
            
            
               
               §. 189. Of Sanctification accompanying
Iuſtification.
               Q. VVHat may be obſerued from the connexion of this Petition
with the former?
               A. Sanctification accompanieth Iuſtification. For as the ſumme
of the former is Iuſtification, ſo the ſumme of this latter is Sanctification,
and in our prayer we are taught to ioyne them together,
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     .
as this particle AND doth import. Reade for proofe of
the indiſſoluble connextion of theſe two, Rom. 6. 1, 2, &amp;c.
1. Cor. 6. 11. Eph. 5. 25.
               The grounds hereof are,
               1. The manifeſtation of mercie and puritie in God.
               2. The cleanſing vertue which accompanieth the merit of
Chriſts ſacrifice.
               3. The operation of the Spirit immediatly iſſuing from our
incorporation into Chriſt.
               4. The efficacie of the Goſpell.
               5. The vertue of faith.
               All theſe are euidently ſet out by the coniunction of Sanctification
with Iuſtification.
               1. Iuſtification commendeth the rich mercie of God in acquitting
ſinners freely and fully of all that debt wherein they ſtand
obliged to his reuenging iuſtice.Gods mercie &amp; puritie manifeſted by mans Iuſtification and Sanctification. And Sanctification ſetteth out
his puritie: ſhewing thatExod. 34. 6, 7. that God which pittieth ſinners,
will not boulſter vp ſinners in their ſinnes. His pittie moueth
him to iuſtifie them, and his puritie moueth him to ſanctifie
them.
               2.A merit and a vertue in Chriſts bloud. That bloud of Chriſt which isMat. 26. 28. 
                  Shed for the remiſſion of
ſinnes,
                  Heb 9. 14. doth purge our conſcience from dead workes to ſerue the liuing
God. This double vſe of Chriſts ſacrifice was manifeſted by
thatIoh. 19. 34. 
                  bloud and water which iſſued out of Chriſts ſide while he
was on the croſſe. They therefore who are iuſtified, are alſo
ſanctified.That ſpirit which vniteth to Chriſt ſanctifieth.
               
               3. By the Spirit of ſanctification we are vnited vnto Chriſt:
and this ſpirit by vertue of that vnion is conueyed into euery
of the members of Chriſts myſticall body.Rom. 8. 9. 
                  Now if any man haue

not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his. But if his Spirit be in any,
it ſanctifieth them.
               4. The grace of God which bringeth ſaluation (that is,The Goſpell a word of righteouſneſſe. the Goſpell)
teacheth vs that denying vngodlineſſe and worldly luſts, we ſhould
liue ſoberly,
                  Tit. 2. 11, 12. 
                  righteouſly, and godly. That word therefore whereby
we are iuſtified giueth no libertie to any licentiouſneſſe, but
doth both direct vs in the way of righteouſneſſe, and alſo giueth
vs abilitie to walke in that way. Hereby it appeareth that
the Goſpell is as pure and incorrupt as the Law.Difference betwixt Law and Goſpell. Indeed the
Law is ſo perfect a rule of righteouſneſſe as it curſeth euery
one that in the leaſt degree ſwarueth from it:Deut. 27. 26. which the Goſpell
doth not, but offereth pardon to the tranſgreſſor. Yet doth
it no more tolerate, or countenance the leaſt ſinne, then the Law
doth: nay rather it bringeth the ſinner that hath gone aſtray,
into the way of righteouſneſſe againe, and enableth him to
walke in that way, which the Law cannot do. So as herein the
Goſpell hath an excellencie ouer the Law. But if the Goſpell
in ſhewing mercie, ſhould boulſter vp a ſinner in any one ſinne,
the Law would triumph ouer the Goſpell, yea and condemne
it. It is therefore neceſſarie for iuſtification of the Goſpell that
ſanctification continually follow iuſtification, as an hand-maid
her miſtreſſe; or rather that, as two ſworne friends and fellowes,
they alwaies keepe company together.
               5. Faith purifieth the heart.
                  Faith purgeth. For that man which in truth beleeueth
his ſinnes to be pardoned,Acts 15. 9. will not like a ſwine wallow in
the mire. A true apprehenſion of Gods Fatherly loue worketh
a filiall loue in mans heart: which loue maketh him as truly to
deſire and endeauour after Sanctification as Iuſtification.
               They therefore who boaſt of their iuſtification and are not
truely ſanctified,Reproofe of carnall Goſpellers. ſeuer Gods purity from his mercy, and the
vertue of Chriſts ſacrifice from the merit thereof, yea the operation
of his Spirit from the vnion of his members vnto him:
they turne the grace of God into wantonneſſe, and proclaime
their faith to be a fruitleſſe and a liueleſſe faith, and in fine giue
too iuſt cauſe to ſuſpect that their pretence of iuſtification is a
meere pretence.Euidence of iuſtification.
               
               Learne we then both to gaine ſound aſſurance to our owne
ſoules,Iam. 2. 18. and alſo to giue good euidence to others of our iuſtification
by ſanctification.Luke 7. 47.

                  A. After pardon men are proue to fall againe. Otherwiſe there
were no need for ſuch as haue aſſurance of the pardon of ſinne
to pray againſt temptation, or for deliuerance from euill. As
wofull experience in all Saints, euen the beſt that euer liued,
doth verifie the truth hereof, ſo alſo the dayly ſacrifices which
vnder the Law were appointed. For euery propitiatorie ſacrifice

he that is iuſtified need to waſh his feet, if he were not ſubiect to

Hereſie is plainely confuted by this Petition.Rhem. on Luk. 15. 1. &amp; on Gal. 3. Yet is it againe
reuiued by Familiſts, yea and by Papiſts too. For they hold that
ſome are ſo righteous in this life as they need no repentance,Ne quisquam ſi bi puro &amp; immaculo pectore blanaditur. Quia nemo eſſe ſine peccato poteſt, quiſquis ſe inculpatum eſſe dixerit, aut ſuperbus, aut ſtultus eſt. Cypr. ap

themſelues from the curſe thereof. If theſe be not Puritans, I

               For our parts, let none boaſt of a pure and immaculate heart;
Seeing no man is without ſinne, whoſoeuer ſaith hee is without
fault▪ is either proud or fooliſh.
               Let vs euen after wee haue good euidence and aſſurance of
the pardon of our ſinne, remaine watchfull againſt all enticements
and temptations to ſinne, and well remember that caueat,

which Chriſt gaue both to him that he healed at the poole

caueat doth not imply that a man may keepe himſelfe pure
from all ſinne, but that hee ought with the beſt care and greateſt
watchfulneſſe that hee can endeuour to bee ſo pure. Care
therefore muſt be taken to preuent ſinne to come, as well as to
ſeeke redreſſe for ſinne paſt: otherwiſe ſinne will ſoone creepe
vpon vs againe. If Satan be caſt out of a man, he will endeuour
to returne into the houſe from whence hee was caſt out;Math. 12 43. 44, 45. and
if hee finde it empty he will ſoone take his opportunitie, and
enter with ſeuen other ſpirits more wicked then himſelfe. They
who take notice of Satans ſubtilty in this kinde, doe by wofull
experience finde, that after their moſt frequent prayers,
ſtricteſt obſeruation of the Sabbath, ſincereſt participation
of the bleſſed Sacrament, ſolemneſt humiliation of their
ſoules on a day of Faſt, in and by which holy duties, they haue
obtained great aſſurance of the pardon of their ſinnes, and
much comfort to their ſoules, Satan hath beene very buſie
in tempting them afreſh, and drawing them to wallow in the
mire of ſinne. Though therefore Chriſt himſelfe ſhould ſay to
vs at once hee did to the man which was brought on a bed to
him,Math. 9. 2. 
                  Be of good cheere, your ſinnes are forgiuen you, yet haue
we no cauſe to bee careleſſe and ſecure, but rather to bee the
more watchfull, leſt
                     Math. 12. 45. Opus eſt nobis quotidiana ſanctificatione vt qui quotidie delinquimus, delicta noſtra ſanctificatione aſſidua repurgemus. Cypr. de Orat. dom § 9. Satan by a re-entry make our laſt eſtate
worſe then the firſt. Wee haue need therefore of dayly
ſanctification, that wee who ſinne dayly may cleanſe away our
ſinnes by continuall ſanctification.
            
            
               §. 191. Of Mans anſwering Gods Mercy
by dutie.
               
                  Q. VVHat other Doctrine may bee obſerued from the inference
of the Sixt Petition on the Fift?
               
                  A. The mercy of God to man requireth dutie of man to God.
The Fift Petition noteth out Gods great mercy in diſcharging
our debt: and the ſixt, our bounden duty in auoiding that
which diſpleaſeth and diſhonoureth him: and, by the rule of

contraries, in endeuouring after that which pleaſeth and honoureth
him. It is ſaid of them, to whomZac. 13. 9. God ſaith, It is my
people, that they ſhall ſay, The Lord is my God.
               
               Equitie, and gratefulneſſe require as much. Moſt iuſt and equall
it is that the goodneſſe of a Soueraigne ſhould bee requited
with all the duty that a ſubiect can performe: and not
to do it, is a great point of vngratefulneſſe.
               The vnrighteouſneſſe therfore,Mans vngratefulneſſe. &amp; vngratefulnes of man to God
is too manifeſtly declared. Though man haue rebelliouſly riſen
vp againſt the Lord, &amp; taken part with his enemie, yet hath the
Lord graciouſly offered pardon to man: and notwithſtanding
his gracious offer of pardon, man will not be drawne from
the enemies ſide, but as a ſworne Slaue continueth to fight vnder
his colours.Deut. 32. 15. God doth much complaine hereof.
               Let vs be better aduiſed: and firſtEpheſ. 3. 18, 19▪
                   take notice of the kindneſſe
of the Lord to vs, and then endeuour toCol. 1. 10. 
                  walke worthy of
the Lord. Let vs therefore bee as conſcionable in performing
duty to God, as wee are deſirous to receiue mercy of God.
That ſo wee may manifeſt a true childlike diſpoſition to God,
and ſhew we reſpect him as well as our ſelues in our deſires and
endeauours.
            
            
               §. 192. Of auoiding temptations.
               
                  Q. VVHat may bee gathered from connexion of the latter
part of the Sixt Petition with the former part?
               A. For auoiding euill, temptations muſt bee auoided. To this
purpoſe tend the many diſſwaſions in Scripture from temptations,
as,
                  Prou. 1. 15. Walke not in the way. Refraine thy foot.—5. 8. Come not
nigh the doore.—4 15. Auoid. Paſſe away.Iſa. 52. 11. Touch no vnclean thing.
Epheſ. 5. 11. Haue no fellowſhip with the vnfruitfull workes of darkneſſe.
2. Cor. 6 17. Come out from among them.
               Temptations to ſonnes of Adam are as fire to dry ſtubble,Danger of temptation.
dry Tinder, yea and dry Gunpowder. A little ſparke ſoone cauſeth
a great flame. Temptation firſt brought man, euen in his
innocent eſtate to euill. If then corrupt man auoid not temptation,
how can he be free from euill? Obſerue the great euils
whereinto the Saints in any ages haue fallen, and you ſhall find
them to be occaſioned by temptations.Gen. 9. 20, 21. 
                  Noahs drunkenneſſe,
                  
                  —19. 33. 
                  Lots Inceſt,
                  2. Sam. 11. 2. 
                  Dauids Adultery,
                  2. Kin. 11. 4. 
                  Salomons Idolatry,
                  Mat. 26. 69, &amp;c 
                  Peters
deniall of Chriſt, were all euill effects of temptations.
               Be wiſe now therefore, O ſonnes of men. You eſpecially
that indeed deſire to be free from euill.Meddle not with temptations. Dally not with temptations:
but rather, as Chriſt
                  Mat. 4. 4, 7, 10. did, reſiſt them manfully and put
them away as farre from you as you can. Men will not bring
barrels of Gunpowder neere the fire, but lay them in places
farre from fire. Shall they be more carefull for their earthy houſes,
then you for your heauenly ſoules? Boaſt not of thine abilitie
to quench the fire of all temptations. Thine abilitie in this
kinde muſt then be greater then Peters, or Salomons, or Dauids,
or Lots, or Noahs, yea or Adams in his innocencie. For a man
to caſt himſelfe into temptations, and to receiue no euill from
thoſe temptations is as great a miracle as the preſeruation of
Shadrach,
                  Dan. 3. 26, &amp;c. 
                  Meſhach, and Abednego in the midſt of the hot fiery
furnace, was.
            
            
               §. 193. Of calling on God for all things.
               Q. WHat may bee obſerued from directing all the Petitions,
which any way concerne our good, to God?
               
                  A. God is all in all. The fourth Petition ſetteth him out a

                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  Giuer of good things. The fift a
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   
                  forgiuer of debts. The former
part of the ſixt, a
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  preſeruer from danger whereunto wee are
ſubiect. The latter part of the ſixt, a
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   
                  deliuerer from euill whereinto
wee are fallen. On this ground might Dauid well ſay,
Whom haue I in heauen but thee?
                  Pſal. 73. 25. 
                  and there is none vpon earth that
I deſire beſides thee.
               
               They who know and beleeue God to be as hee is, all in all,
cannot but deteſt that heatheniſh and blaſphemous diſtinction
of white and blacke gods: the former of which they made Beſtowers
of good things,
                  1. Cor. 8. 6. the latter Deliuerers from euill things. But
to vs there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and
wee in him. Of him wee ought to ſeeke euery good thing wee
want. To him we ought to fly for ſuccour againſt all euill. So
we are here taught: ſo let vs doe.
            
            
               
               §. 194. Of the general points for which wee are
taught to pray in the laſt Petition.
               
                  Q. VVHat are wee to pray for by vertue of the laſt
Petition?
               1. Such things as concerne the whole Petition
in generall: or the diſtinct parts thereof in particular,
               1. In regard of the whole, we ought to pray for Sanctification.
Thus doth Saint Paul pray for the Theſſalonians,
                  1. Theſ. 5. 23. 
                  The very
God of Peace ſanctifie you wholly. As our owne happineſſe moueth
vs to pray for Iuſtification, in the former Petition, that wee
may be acquitted of ſinne, for which we ſhould otherwiſe be
damned: ſo the honour of God ſhould moue vs to pray for
ſanctification.1. Theſ. 4. 3. For this is the will of God, our ſanctification, and
thereby is the holy God much honoured.
               2. In regard of the manner of ſetting downe this Petition
negatiuely, we are taught to pray for Freedome againſt the power
of ſinne,
                  Pſal. 19. 13. 13. as the Pſalmiſt doth where hee ſaith, Cleanſe meè from
ſecret faults: keepe backe thy ſeruant alſo from preſumptuous ſins;
let them not haue dominion ouer mee. For in ſinne there is a guilt
which maketh vs lyable to Gods vengeance (this is prayed againſt
in the Fift Petition) and a power which holdeth vs in
bondage, and maketh vs ſuch ſlaues thereto, as wee cannot
ſerue God.
               3. For this end we are taught to pray for Participation of the
power of Chriſts death, and
               4. Participation of the Spirit of Chriſt. For in Chriſts death
there is diſtinctly to be conſidered a Merit, and a Power. The
Merit thereof freeth from the guilt and puniſhment of ſinne. The
Power thereof from the dominion, yea and by degrees from the
very act of ſinne: which in the Saints after the death of their
body ſhall vtterly ceaſe. Of this power of Chriſts death thus
ſpeaketh the Apoſtle,Rom. 6. 4, 6. 
                  We are buried with Chriſt by Baptiſme into
death, &amp;c. And againe, Our old man is crucified with him, that
the body of ſinne might be deſtroyed, that henceforth wee ſhould not
ſerue ſinne. This power of Chriſts death is conueighed into vs by
the Spirit of Chriſt.Epheſ. 2. 1. For wee are dead in ſinne.
                  Rom. 8. 11. 
                  But if the Spirit

of him that raiſed vp Ieſus from the dead dwell in vs, it will
quicken vs. Wherefore that wee may partake of the power of
Chriſts death, wee muſt pray for participation of the Spirit of
Chriſt. Dauid well knew how requiſite this Spirit was to keep
downe the power of ſinne, and therefore hauing prayed for
pardon of ſinne,Pſal. 51. 11. further prayeth that God would not take his
holy Spirit from him.
               
               Theſe are the generall things which by vertue of this whole Petition
we are to pray for. We will further note out ſuch particulars
as concerne the diſtinct parts.
            
            
               §. 195. Of the particulars for which we are to pray
by vertue of the firſt part of the laſt
Petition.
               
                  Q. VVHat are the particulars to be prayed for vnder the
firſt part of the Sixt Petition?
               
                  A. 1. Knowledge of our ſpirituall enemies.
Without knowledge of them, there will be no feare of them,
no deſire of helpe and ſuccour againſt them, or of freedome
from them.Iudg. 18. 28. The people of Laiſh not knowing that the Danites
were their enemies, or that they had any purpoſe to ſurprize
them, were ſecure, and made no preparations for their owne
defence: and ſo were vtterly vanquiſhed. Such ignorance maketh
moſt in the world ſo ſecure as they are Experience ſheweth
that the more ignorant any are, the more deepely they are implunged
into Satans ſnares, and the faſter held thereby. Here
therefore we muſt pray for knowledge of the diſtinct kindes of
our ſpirituall enemies: of their number, might, malice, ſubtiltie,
and ſedulitie. That we may the better know all theſe, the
Apoſtle doth largely and diſtinctly deſcribe them, Epheſ. 6. 12.
               2. Sight of the danger wherein wee are by reaſon of them. To
know that there are enemies, pernicious, and dangerous enemies
little moueth them who ſee no danger wherein themſelues are
by reaſon of ſuch enemies.2. Kin. 6. 15. When Eliſha's ſeruant ſaw the hoſte
of Aram that compaſſed the place where he was, then he cryed
out, Alas my Maſter, how ſhall we doe? Thus will they bee affected

that are able to diſcerne the danger wherein they are by
reaſon of their ſpirituall enemies. They will enquire what to
doe. But the danger which is not ſeene, is not feared. Wherefore
God ſends Miniſters to people.Act. 26. 18. 
                  To open their eyes that they
may come from the power of Satan to God.
               
               3. Wiſedome to diſcerne their wiles, their many cunning ſtratagems,
and kindes of aſſaults: and to finde out where their
ſtrength lyeth: and how they may be withſtood. Thus ſhall we
be kept the more ſafely from them, that wee fall not into their
temptations,Pſal. 119. 98, 99, 100. and be ouercome by them. Dauid who obtained
ſuch wiſedome vndoubtedly prayed for it.
               4. Vnderſtanding of our owne weakeneſſe. How vnable we are
to ſtand of our ſelues: much more vnable to withſtand ſuch
enemies as we haue,Epheſ. 6. 12. which are not, as we, fleſh and bloud, but
Spirits,
                  Math. 26. 41. yea Principalities and powers, &amp;c. When the Spirit is
ready, the fleſh is weake: how much more weake will it be when
the ſpirit is ſecure. Such as know not their owne weakeneſſe
will be ſo ouer-bold and preſumptuous as they will not feare to
caſt themſelues into temptations.
               5. Knowledge of the almightie power of God. Thus doth the
Apoſtle expreſſely pray in behalfe of the Epheſians, that they
may know what is the exceeding greatneſſe of his power towards
them that beleeue.
                  Epheſ. 1. 18, 19. Knowledge of the enemies power, and of
our owne weakeneſſe cannot but affright vs, and make vs faintingly
fall into their temptations, vnleſſe withall we know the
power of God to bee able to make vs ſtand, and to ſubdue our
enemies, and cleane to free vs from all their temptations.
Knowledge hereof will raiſe vp our hearts to God in all dangers.2. Chro. 14, 11.
               
               6. Reſtraint of Satans power. This the Angell intended when
hee ſaid to the Diuell,Iude verſe 9. 
                  The Lord rebuke thee. So malicious and
audacious is Satan as hee will not ſticke to aſſault the beſt, if the
Lord doe not reſtraine him. It is moſt likely that hee could not
be ignorant that Chriſt was the Sonne of God, and yet did hee
venter to ſet vpon him.Math. 4. 3. Now when God hath giuen vs vnderſtanding
of his owne power, of our owne weakeneſſe, and of
Satans might and malice, then ſhall wee ſee iuſt cauſe to pray to
God to rebuke Satan.
               
                  
7. Aſſiſtance from God: for though Satan be reſtrained, yet
cannot wee ſtand of our ſelues, but ſhall fall euen thorow our
owne weakeneſſe.Pſal 109. 23, 26. The conſideration of his owne weakeneſſe
made the Pſalmiſt ſeeke helpe of God.Rom. 8. 31. For If God be for vs, who
can be againſt vs? Great reaſon there is therefore to ſeeke aſſiſtance
of God.
               8. Confidence and courage in God. This is it which the Apoſtle
intendeth,Epheſ. 6. 10. where he exhorteth to be ſtrong in the Lord. For nene
of them that truſt in God ſhall be deſolate.
                  Pſal. 34. 22.—18. 30. 
                  He is their buckler. Hee
ſaueth them. It is therefore moſt requiſite to pray for affiance in
him.
               9. Sufficient grace to beare out aſſaults when wee are tempted.
For ſometimes it is needfull for vs to be tempted. Then our requeſt
ought to bee that that which is needfull may proue vſefull
and profitable:2. Cor. 12. 9. which cannot be without Gods grace. This
therefore God gaue in the time of temptation to his Apoſtle:Primus hoſtis caro eſt aduerſus ſpiritum concupiſcens. Hoſtem hunc crudeliſſimum nec fugere poſſumus nec fugare: circum
                        •
                     erre illam neceſſe eſt, quoniam alligatus eſt nobis. Nam quod eſt m
                        •
                     ſerabilius, hoſtem noſtrum ipſi cogimur ſuſtentare, perimere eum non licet. Bern. de Euang. 7. Pan. Ser. 3.
teaching vs thereby in the like caſe to pray for the like grace.
               10. Power ouer the fleſh. The fleſh is a ſecret inward tempter,
whereby Satan gets great aduantage. It continually lúſteth, and
fighteth againſt the Spirit. If it preuaile we are gone. Now in that
this fleſh is euer in vs ſo long as we retaine fleſh vpon vs, who
hath not cauſe to pray, and cry as the Apoſtle did, O wretched
man that I am, who ſhall deliuer mee from the body of this death!
Rom. 7. 24. We can neither fly from, nor put to flight this cruell
enemy. Wee cannot but carry it about with vs, becauſe it is
bound to vs. And which is more miſerable, wee are forced to
nouriſh this enemy: deſtroy it we cannot.
               11. Contempt of the world. The world is another tempter,
which hath ſundry baits of pleaſures, profits, and promotions to
allure vs vnto it: and thorow fiue gates, the fiue ſences, it woundeth
vs.Praeſens ſeculum per quinque portus, quin
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                     , viz. corporis ſenſus 
                        •
                     aculis ſuis vulnerat 
                        •
                     e. Et 
                        •
                     ors intrat per ſeneſtras meas. Ibid. If they be opened, and our hearts attentiue to the allurements
thereof, wee are in great danger to bee ouer-taken
therewith: death may enter by thoſe windowes. So as there is
great need we ſhould pray as the Pſalmiſt did, Incline not my
heart to couetouſneſſe. Turne away mine eyes from beholding vanity.
Pſal 119 36, 37.
               12. Patience vnder all croſſes. Croſſes are a kinde of tryall and
temptation. By impatiency wee are brought to faint and ſinke

vnder them which is to be ouercome. This is it which Sathan
watcheth for. For ſo ſoone as hee obſerueth any to faint and fall,
hee preſently ſeazeth vpon them. Not without cauſe therefore
did the Apoſtle Pray for the Coloſſians that they might bee
ſtrengthened with all might vnto all patience.
                  Col. 1. 11. Vnder this head are
compriſed Hope, Comfort, Ioy and Glory in afflictions: all to
bee prayed for:Act. 4. 29. and withall an inuincible courage againſt perſecution
for the Name of Chriſt.
               13. Moderation of all afflictions. Though we haue ſome patience,
yet if afflictions increaſe, they may ſo try our patience, as to
bring it to naught. For they which haue the greateſt meaſure
haue but their meaſure: and afflictions by continuance and increaſe
may exceed that meaſure:Ier. 10 24. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   which the Prophet well knew
when he thus prayed, O Lord correct me, but with iudgement. By
iudgement is not there meant vengeance and indignation (for it is
oppoſed to wrath.)In modo Caſtiga me Iehoua, veruntamen modicè. Tremel. &amp; Iun. But wiſedome, diſcretion and moderation.
Hereby we are kept both from fainting when we are chaſtened:
and alſo from murmuring againſt the rod.
               14. Preſeruation from a reprobate ſence. For if we be once giuen
vp thereto, then hath Satan faſt hold of vs. God hath vtterly
forſaken ſuch. Euery temptation is to them as a ſnare to hold
them faſt, and as an hooke to pull them downe to deſtruction.
Moſt fitly may that which the Apoſtle ſaith of them that will be
rich, be applyed to ſuch as are of a reprobate ſence,1. Tim. 6. 9. 
                  They fall
into temptation and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh and hurtfull luſts,
which drowne men in perdition and deſtruction. For men of a reprobate
ſence are ſuch, as, being depriued of all iudgement and
conſcience, runne headlong into ſuch euils as are againſt the inſtinct
of nature. Becauſe blindneſſe of mind, hardneſſe of heart,
deadneſſe of conſcience, peruerſneſſe of affection, pride, preſumption,
ſelfe-conceitedneſſe, idleneſſe, careleſneſſe, ſecuritie
and ſuch like vices are fore-runners vnto a reprobate ſence, wee
ought alſo earneſtly to pray againſt them all.
            
            
               
               §. 196. Of the particulars for which we are to pry
by vertue of the ſecond part of
the laſt Petition.
               
                  Q. VVHat are the particulars to be prayed for vnder the
ſecond part of the Sixt Petition,
               
                  A. 1. Recouerie from ſinne being fallen into
it.
                  Pſal. 51. 10. This is one maine point deſired in Dauids penitentiary
Pſalme, eſpecially in this phraſe, Renew a right ſpirit within mee.
Repentance is that grace whereby ſuch as are fallen recouer
themſelues, as is euident by this aduice which Chriſt giueth, Remember
from whence thou art fallen,
                  Reu. 2. 5. 
                  and repent. Repentance therefore
is heere to be prayed for. Satan is as much diſappointed by
repenting of ſinne, as by not yeelding to ſinne.
               2. Diſpoſſeſſion of Satan. Satan is that Euill one that hath his
finger in euery euill thing. So long as hee abideth any where,
freedome from euill cannot he expected. If hee therefore haue
really entered into any,Mat. 15. 22. as he did into the woman of Canaans
daughter, we muſt pray, as ſhe did, to haue him diſpoſſeſt. For
by prayer and faſting he may be caſt out.
                  Mar. 9. 29. If otherwiſe hee ſeaze on
vs by putting into vs euill thoughts, or ſtirring vp corrupt humours,
or ſetting before vs euill obiects, or affrighting vs, or
vexing vs any way in ſoule or body, we are taught to pray for
deliuerance from him.
               3. Alienation of heart from the world. They who haue beene
bewitched by the world, ſo as they haue loued the ſame, and
haue beene entangled therein, which is a great euill, ought to
pray to bee pulled out of it: and to haue their hearts turned
from it, as the heart of Amnon was from Tamar: ſo that the
hatred wherewith they hate it,2 Sam. 13. 15. may bee greater then the loue
wherewith they loued it. This wee ought to pray for in regard
of lewd company, vnlawfull games, vndue honours, vniuſt
gaine, immoderate pleaſures, or any other like thing wherewith
wee haue beene bewitched. Till our hearts bee alienated
from the world, we ſhall neuer bee throughly deliuered from
the euill of the world.
               4. Suppreſſion of all the luſts of the fleſh, after they are riſen vp.

Preuention of them is implied in the former part of this Petition.
If that be not obtained but that the fleſh doth riſe vp &amp; luſt
and rebell againſt the Spirit, our deſire ought to bee, to haue
thoſe luſts beaten downe againe, and we freed from the thraldome
of them. Saint Paul reckons vp 17. particular luſts of the
fleſh together.Gal. 5. 19, 20, 21. Thoſe and other like to thoſe are all ſimply euill,
ſuch euills as if they be not beaten downe and we deliuered
from the bondage of them, will bring vs to eternall death.
               5. Remouall of iudgements. Such afflictions as come from the
wrath of God, and ſo long as they lie vpon vs, manifeſt his indignation
againſt vs, are as euills to be prayed againſt. In which
reſpect thus prayeth the Church, Turne vs againe, O God: and
cauſe thy face to ſhine.
                  Pſal. 80. 3, 4. 
                  O Lord God of Hoſt▪ how long wilt thou be
angry? Such a iudgement was that Plague for the remouall
whereof Dauid built an Altar,2 Sam. 24. 25. and offered Sacrifice. Among
theſe, ſpirituall iudgements are moſt earneſtly to be prayed againſt:
ſuch as were mentioned in the end of the laſt §. If the
preuention of them be to be prayed ſon much more deliuerance
from them. For they are doubly euill. 1. As they are ſinnes.
2 As they are puniſhments of ſins, and effects of Gods wrath.
To this head may be alſo referred all manner of croſſes, asPſal. 46. 9. war,
Ioel. 2. 19. famine,2 Sam. 24. 25. plague,Pro. 30. 8. pouerty,Dan. 9. 17. captiuity,Act. 12. 5. impriſonment,Pſal. 119. 22. reproach,
2 King. 20. 3. ſickneſſe,Pſal 38. 1, &amp;c. paine and ſuch like afflictions for remouall
whereof we may pray, as was ſhewed§. 124. before.
               6. A bleſſed departure out of this world. So long as wee are in
this world we are ſubiect to many euills, which lie and preſſe
ſore vpon vs. But by death we are deliuered from them all: at
leſt if our death be in the Lord. For they only are bleſſed that die
in the Lord. They which die not in the Lord, are not deliuered
from euill: but like the fiſh which leapeth out of warme water
into flaming fier,Reu. 14. 13. go from the leſſe euill into the greater by many
degrees.
               Q. May a man then pray for death?
               
                  A. Not ſimply and abſolutely, with deſire to haue the time
appointed by God, preuented, but with ſubmiſſion to the
good pleaſure of God. Concerning our departure out of this
world two things are here intended. 1. That we be willing no
depart. 2. That our departure be in the Lord. Both theſe are

manifeſted in old Simeons ſwanlike-ſong: where hee ſheweth
his willingneſſe to depart,
                  Luke 2. 29. and his deſire to depart in peace. So
much alſo is euident in Saint Pauls deſire.Phil. 1. 23. 
                  I haue (ſaith he) a
deſire to depart. This was not an abſolute prayer for death. It
was a manifeſtation rather of what he could willingly haue wiſhed,Votum affectus, non effectus.
in his owne behalfe, then of what he peremptorily or abſolutely
would deſire. Now where hee addeth, and to bee with
Chriſt, hee ſheweth what kinde of death hee deſired. And this
we muſt abſolutely deſire, that when we dye, we may dye the
death of the righteous, an happy death: which is a finall deliuery
from all the euill whereunto in this world wee are ſubiect.
               7. Reſurrection of the body. For death in it ſelfe is an euill, holding
the body in the graue as in a priſon where it rotteth and
conſumeth. The reſurrection of the body is it that maketh a
mans diſſolution to be a bleſſing. Thus is his body by death as
ſeede ſowne in the ground which bringeth forth an harueſt.
This Chriſt hath promiſed:Ioh. 5. 28. this therefore wee may and muſt
pray for.
               8. Abſolution at the day of iudgement. When our bodies
are raiſed, they together with our ſoules ſhall be preſented before
Chriſts tribunall ſeate. There to bee condemned for our
ſinnes, is a farre greater euill then any that in this world can
befall vs. And better it were that our bodies ſhould neuer be
raiſed, then bee raiſed to condemnation. Oft therefore doth
the Apoſtle pray for the Saints that they may be kept blameleſſe
vnto the comming of Chriſt.
                  1 Theſ. 3. 13.—5. 23.
               
               9. Aeternall glory in heauen. They who are aduanced thereunto
are fully deliuered from all euill, and from all feare of all
euill.Reu. 21. 4. In which reſpect it is ſaid that God ſhall wipe away all teares
from their eyes: that is, hee ſhall take away all occaſions of
mourning: therefore by way of explication it is added, There
ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow, nor crying, &amp;c. This was
it that the penitentiary thiefe prayed for in theſe words, Lord
remember me when thou commeſt into thy Kingdome.
                  Luk. 23. 42. Thus we ſee
how this prayer directeth vs to pray for al things that are needfull
for vs, from that corruptible bread whereby our mortall
bodies are nouriſhed, to that glory of ſoule and body which

endureth for euer.Quando dicimu
                        •
                      libera nos à malo, nihil remanet quod vl
                        •
                     ra adhuc debeat poſtulari. Cypr. de Orat. Dom. §. 19. For when we ſay, Deliuer vs from euill, there
remaineth nothing that further we may aske.
            
            
               §. 197. Of the things for which we ought to
giue thankes in the laſt
Petition.
               Q. VVHat are the things for which thanks is to be giuen by
virtue of the laſt Petition?
               
                  A. 1. Euery ſanctifying Grace.
               2. Freedome from the power of darkneſſe.
               For both theſe we haue the expreſſe patterne of the Apoſtle:1 Cor. 1. 4.
In regard of the former hee ſaith I thanke my God for the grace
of God.
                  —5. Vnder this indefinite word Grace, he compriſeth euery
particular ſanctifying grace. Wherefore hee addeth, In euery
thing (that is in euery grace) ye are euriched.
                  —7. And yee are not deſtitute
of any gift.
                  Col. 1, 12, 13. In regard of the latter he alſo ſaith, I giue
thankes to the Father, who hath deliuered vs from the power of
darkneſſe. We heard§. 169. before that San
                        •
                     lification was the Summe
of this Petition. But particular ſanctifying graces (whereof
nine are reckoned vp together, Gal. 5. 22, 23.) are the parts and
members which make vp that Summe. Of theſe therefore wee
muſt take notice, and for theſe wee muſt giue thankes. Now
becauſe that Summe is implyed vnder the negatiue, we are anſwerably
to giue thankes for freedome from the contrary,
which the Apoſtle ſtileth power of darkneſſe. Vnder darkneſſe
he compriſeth ſin, death, diuell, and damnation. While wee are
vnder the power of theſe, we are their vaſſalls. It is therefore
a bleſſing worthy of all praiſe to be freed from them.
               Other particulars ſeuerally concerne the diſtinct parts of this Petition.
            
            
               
               §. 198. Of the particulars for which thankes
is to bee giuen by virtue of the firſt part of
the laſt Petition.
               
                  Q. VVHat are the particulars for which the firſt
part of the ſixt Petition requireth thankes to bee
giuen.
               
                  A. 1. Vnder ſtanding of the law, whereby we know what ſin
is, when we are tempted thereto, how fearefull a thing it is to
yeeld to ſuch temptations, how wretched their caſe is that are
left to the power of temptation.Rom. 3. 20. 
                  By the Law is the knowledge
of ſinne. That therefore which giueth vs notice of ſo great danger,
is a thing praiſe-worthy: eſpecially if we haue vnderſtanding
thereof.Pſal. 119. 99, 100 In way of thankfulneſſe doth Dauid oft acknowledge this.
               2. Wiſedome to diſcerne our enemies and their aſſaults. This
proceedeth from the former, and goeth a degree farther; and in
that reſpect it bindeth vs to more thankfulneſſe. With thankfulneſſe
ſaith the Pſalmiſt to God,Pſal. 119. 98. 
                  Thou thorew thy commandements
haſt made me wiſer then mine enemies.
               
               3. The victory which Chriſt hath go
                        •
                     ten ouer ſpirituall enemies.
It is in praiſe of Chriſt that the Pſalmiſt ſaith to him, Thou
haſt led captituity captiue.
                  Pſal. 68. 18. By captiuity hee meaneth the world,
the fleſh, ſinne, death, the diuell and all other enemies of our
ſoule. Were not theſe by Chriſt made captiues, and ſo chained,
reſtrained and kept in, we could not ſtand againſt them, they
would ſoone leade vs captiues. For our ſakes did Chriſt enter
combate with them, and get victory ouer them. We reape the
benefit thereof: wee therefore muſt giue the thankes to Chriſt,
and ſay (as the heauenly Spirits doe) we giue thee thankes becauſe
thou haſt taken to thee thy great power,
                  Reu. 11. 17, 18. 
                  and haſt raigned: and deſtroyed
them that deſtroy the earth.
               
               4. Strength to withſtand our enemies. As Chriſt himſelfe hath
ouercome them, ſo by his ſpirit hee giueth vs power to ouercome,2 Tim. 1. 7.
in which reſpect it is ſaid, Hee hath giuen to vs the Spirit
of power. On which ground ſaith the Apoſtle, I thanke him who
hath enabled me.
                  1 Tim. 1. 12.
               
               
                  
5. Reſolution to yeeld to no allurements whether they come
from the fleſh or the world.
                  Gratias deo, qui iam harum rerum in vobis glori
                        •
                      tranſitoriae glorioſum eſt operatus contemptum. Bern. Epiſt. 23. A true, ſetled reſolution is a great
meanes to keepe vs ſafe. This comes from God. For by nature
our diſpoſition is wholy inclined to the world and to the
fleſh. Wherefore as1. Sa. 25. 32, 33 
                  Dauid bleſſed God for aſſwaging his paſſion,
and keeping him from ſhedding blood, ſo wee muſt praiſe
God (whenſoeuer our minde is alienated from the world and
fleſh) for that alteration of our diſpoſition.
               6. Patience to beare out all brunts. Afflictions to our weake
fleſh are ſoare temptations: but by patience wee are kept from
being ſwallowed vp by them. In which reſpect the Apoſtle ſaw
great cauſe to thanke God for the patience of the Theſſalonians.2 Theſ. 1. 3, 4.
               
               7. Power in all conflicts to ouercome. Such, though they bee
led vnto temptation, are not led into temptation. It is expreſſely
noted of them that had gotten victory, that they ſang a ſong of
praiſe.
                  Reu. 15. 2, 3.
               
            
            
               §. 199. Of the particulars for which thankes
is to be giuen by virtue of the laſt part
of the laſt Petition.
               
                  Q. VVHat are the things for which the ſecond part of the
laſt Petition requireth thankes?
               
                  A. 1. Repentance after ſinne committed. This is
a ſure euidence of deliuerance from a great euill. Therefore
the Church glorified God becauſe hee had granted repentance.
                  Act. 11. 18.
               
               2. Reſcue out of Satans clutches. If Satan haue at any time
got any aduantage againſt vs, as he getteth great aduantage againſt
witches and ſorcerers, yea and againſt other impudent,
and audacious ſinners whom he hath faſt in his clutches, to bee
reſcued and recouered out of his hands affordeth iuſt cauſe of
much thankes:Luk. 8. 2, 3. which Mary Magdalene, out of whom went ſe
                     
                        •
                     en
diuels, well knew to be moſt due, and therefore in teſtimony
of thankfulneſſe ſhee followed Chriſt and miniſtred to
him of her ſubſtance.
               
                  
3. Recouery out of the world.
                  Gal. 1. 4, 5. The Apoſtle aſcribeth glory to
Chriſt for deliuering vs from this preſent euill world.
               4. Conqueſt of the Spirit ouer the fleſh. For by the Spirits conqueſt,Rom. 7. 25.
are we freed from the dominion of the fleſh. For this
therefore the Apoſtle giueth expreſſe thankes.
               5. Remouall of iudgements. Iudgements and all manner of
croſſes are in their kinde euills: and remouall of them is a deliuerance
from thoſe euills: Whereupon the Saints haue beene
thankfull for ſuch deliuerances.Exod 15. 1, &amp;c. The Iſraelites giue thankes to
God for freeing them from the Egyptian bondage:1. Chro. 21. 28. And Dauid
for cauſing the Plague to ceaſe: And Hezekiah for taking
away a deadly diſeaſe;Iſa. 38. 9. &amp;c. And the Church for returning her captiuity.Pſal. 126. 1, 2.
               
               6. Victory ouer death. Death in it ſelfe is a dreadfull euill: the
very e
                     •
                  trance into damnation. But by Chriſt the ſting of it is
pulled out, the nature of it is altered. It is made a gate into
eternall glory.1. Cor. 15. 57. This is that victory for which Saint Paul giueth
thankes.
               7. Hope of reſurrection to life.
               8. Hope of eternall glory. Theſe are full and ſmall deliuerances
from all euill. Gods promiſe of theſe to ſuch as beleeue,
is as a performance of them. Our hope therefore reſting on
Gods promiſe for theſe affordeth iuſt occaſion of reioycing
and praiſing GOD,1. Pet. 1. 3, 4. as Saint Peter doth, and Saint Paul
alſo.Col. 1. 12.
               
            
            
               §. 200. Of duties required in the laſt
Petition.
               
                  Q. VVHat duties are we to endeauour after by virtue of the
laſt Petition?
               
                  A. 1. To abſtaine from all ſinne. For this is the maine thing
heere prayed againſt. This is it which maketh temptation ſo
hurtfull as it is. The more we forbeare ſinne, the leſſe damage
ſhall we receiue from any temptations.Pſal. 34. 14. Many,Am. 5. 15. many therefore
are the dehortations of Scripture againſt ſinne.Rom. 12. 9.
               
               
                  
2.2. Cor. 7. 1. 
                  To perfect holineſſe. For vnder the auoiding of any euill,
an endeauouring after the contrary good is alwayes in Scripture
implyed. YeaIſa. 1. 16, 17. they are very oft ioyned together.3. Ioh. ver. 11. Now
holineſſe is perfected both by2. Pet. 1. 5, 6, 7. 
                  adding one grace to another, and
alſo by1. Pet. 2. 2. 
                  continuall growth in euery grace.Eph. 4. 15.
               
               Theſe two duties ariſe from the generall Summe of the laſt
Petition.
               3. To be iealous ouer our ſelues,
                  Heb. 3. 12.—4. 1. fearing leſt at any time wee
ſhould be ouercome by any temptation. For we are not onely
weake, eaſie to be ouertaken, and ouerthrowne by euery temptation,
but alſo very proane to yeald to Satans temptations, becauſe
they are either agreeable to our corrupt humour, or elſe
we ſo fearefull, as to thinke we ſhall neuer ſtand out againſt
them. This Chriſtian iealouſie will make vs the more inſtantly
and conſtantly to ſeeke helpe of God.
               4.See §. 192. 
                  To auoide all occaſions of euill. Occaſions of euill are temptations
to euill. Should not they then who pray againſt temptations,
auoide them as much as poſſibly then can?
               5. To withſtand beginnings. So did the Apoſtle whenGal. 2. 5. hee
would not giue place to falſe brethren (who were dangerous tempters)
no not for an houre. Thus much alſo he intendeth in this exhortation,
Eph. 4. 27. 
                  Giue no place to the diuell: which is as if he had ſaid,
If Satan at any time tempt you, yeald not an inch to him, let
him get no aduantage at all, which he cannot but get, if at the
beginning ye yeald any whit at all to him. Much good is got
by a due obſeruation of this dutie, and much wiſedome is manifeſted
thereby. For that euill which in the beginning is eaſily
preuented,Obſta principijs ſerò medicina paratur, Cum mala per longas conualuere moras. Ouid. de Triſt. can hardly, if at all, without very much dammage be
redreſſed, after it hath found ſome entrance. Inſtance poyſonous
and peſtiferous diſeaſes, fretting and feſtering ſoares, fiers, breaches
of water, and enemies entring within the walls of a Citie.
               6. To watch continually.
                  Mat. 24. 42. This is a dutie whereunto in Scripture
we are much exhorted: and that not without cauſe. For
our ſpirituall enemies are alwayes readie to tempt vs,Turpius eijcit
                        ••
                      qu
                        •
                     m non admittitur hoſlis. narrowly
prying where to get any aduantage againſt vs. And ſoone
they will get too great aduantage, if we be not the more watchfull.Acts 20. 31.
To ſhew that this dutie is fitly inferred out of this Petition,1. Cor. 16. 13.
Chriſt expreſly ioyneth it with prayer againſt temptation,2. Tim. 4. 5.
                  
ſaying, Watch and pray that yee enter not into temptation.
               
               7. To be
                  1. Pet. 5. 8. 
                  ſober and
                  Luke 21. 34. 
                  temperate: where theſe are not, euery
tempter will rule as he liſt. For intemperancie and all exceſſe
blind the vnderſtanding, and open a paſſage to all manner of
euill deſires and filthy luſts, and make vs vnfit to pray, to
watch, to fight, and to defend our ſelues againſt our ſpirituall
enemies.
               8. To caſt off euery burden.
                  Heb. 12. 1. By burdens are meant not onely
ſuch things as are ſimply euill in themſelues, but ſuch alſo as
being in their nature good, and may lawfully bee vſed, yet
through our weakneſſe and inabilitie to vſe them well, proue
impediments to vs in our ſpirituall combate: as the riches of
that Ruler whom Chriſt aduiſed to ſell all that he had,Luke 18. 22. and to
giue it to the poore. Thus if honours, offices, recreations, companies
which we frequent, or any worldly thing wherein wee
delight proue a burden to vs, and make vs vnfit to reſiſt temptations,
yea rather make vs yeald to temptations, we are to caſt
them off, to auoide and forſake them.
               9. To mortifie our members on the earth.
                  Col. 3. 5. The fleſh, that is our
corrupt nature,Exponded. which containeth in it the maſſe of all ſinne, is
ſtiled aRow. 6. 
                        •
                     .—7. 24. 
                  Body. This bodie is made vp of ſeuerall particular luſts,
and euill motions, as a body of members. And as a bodie exerciſeth
all functions by the members, ſo the fleſh executeth all
miſchiefes by particular luſts: and one luſt helpeth another, as
one member another, and as deare are theſe luſts to the naturall
man, as the members of his body. Thoſe particular luſts are
therefore fitly ſtiled members, and they are ſaid to be members on
the earth,
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 1. In oppoſition to the ſpirit, and the graces thereof
which come from heauen, and bring men to heauen. 2. In their
own condition, which is, as the earth, baſe, filthy, corrupt, and
vaine: 3. In their operation, whereby they make men grouel and
dote on the earth, and the things therein. By mortifying theſe,
the foreſaid Bodie (which is a dangerous tempter) will in time
be depriued of all ſtrength, &amp; we freed from the danger of the
temptations thereof. Be diligent therefore in ſearching them
out, and hauing found them ſpare them not as1. Sam. 15. 9. 33. 
                  Saul did the fat
beaſts: but deale with them as Samuel did with Agag: and

                  Ioſ. 10. 26. 
                  Ioſhua with the kings of Canaan.
               10. To beate downe our bodie. This is done by forbearing to
pamper our ſelues,1. Cor. 9. 27. and to ſatisfie our carnall deſires, that ſo the
fleſh may not waxe wanton, and like a pampered iade become
vnruly: but that wee may liue within the compaſſe preſcribed
and limited by Gods word.
               11. To renounce the world. The world is ſuch a tempter, as
Iam. 4. 4. 
                  the friendſhip of it is enmitie with God.
                  1. Ioh. 2. 15. 
                  If any man loue the world,
the loue of the Father is not in him.
                  2. Tim. 4. 10. 
                  Demas, that old Diſciple
Demas by embracing the world was brought to renounce his
Chriſtian profeſſion. It is therefore moſt meete thatGal. 6. 14. 
                  the world
be crucified to vs, and we to the world: that our hearts bee cleane
alienated one from another, and that wee haue no more to do
one with another then the liuing with the dead. Thus ſhall
wee bee ſure not to bee ouertaken by the temptations of the
world.
               12. To reſiſt the diuell.
                  1. Pet. 5. 9. This is the onely way to eſcape his
temptations. He is like a wolfe, which fiercely purſueth and neuer
leaueth ſuch as fearefully flie from him: but flieth from
ſuch as manfully ſtand againſt him.Iam. 4. 7. So ſaith the Apoſtle, Reſiſt
the diuell, and he will flie from you.
               
               13. To put our truſt in God.
                  Pſal. 62. 5, 6, 7, 8. To what end do we elſe pray vnto
God?
               14.Iam. 5. 8. 
                  To ſuffer afflictions patiently. All croſſes and afflictions
are temptations.Reu. 2. 3. By a patient enduring of them, wee keepe
our ſelues from being ouercome by them.See the whole Armour of God, on Eph. 6 15. 
                  Let patience therefore
haue her perfect worke.
               
               The laſt 12 duties ariſe from the firſt part of the laſt
Petition.Treat. 2. Part. 5. §. 16.
               
               15. To auoide that which is any way euill. This we praying againſt,
muſt carefully auoide.1. Theſſ. 5. 22. The Apoſtle exhorteth to abstaine
from all appearance of euill.
               
               16. To returne from that euill whereinto we are fallen.
                  Ier. 3. 1. For they
which pray to be deliuered from euill, muſt not lie in euill. All
the exhortations in the Scripture to repent,
                  Reu. 2. 5. tend to this purpoſe.
               17. To take heed of relapſe. A relapſe in bodily diſeaſes is dangerous:
much more in the ſoules diſeaſe. It is a doggiſh tricke

to turne to his owne vomit againe.
                  2. Pet. 2. 22.
               
               18. To keepe the enemie from returning after he is caſt out.
                  Mat. 12. 43, 44, 45. Hee
will ſeeke to reenter. If he get what he ſeeketh, our laſt eſtate
will be worſe then our firſt.
               19. To ſtand alwayes armed.
                  Eph. 6. 13. While we liue we ſhall be tempted.
Though the tempter be repulſed neuer ſo oft, he will ſtill
be prying where to get an aduantage. Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle,
Hauing done all, ſtand.
               
               20. Be faithfull vnto death.
                  Reu. 2. 10. Death bringeth a finall end to all
aſſaults.1. Cor. 15. 26. It is the laſt enemie. He who is faithfull vnto death, by
death receiueth full deliuerance from all euill.Perſeuerantia tantum electorū eſt. Bern. in Serm. paru. Serm. 61. Perſeuerance
giueth euidence of election to life: for it is proper to the
elect.
               Theſe ſixe laſt duties ariſe from the laſt part of the laſt
Petition.
            
            
               §. 201. Of duties required in the laſt Petition
in regard of others.
               
                  Q. VVHat duties doth the laſt Petition teach vs in the behalfe
of others?
               
                  A. 1. To conſider one another.
                  Heb. 10. 24. We ought to take
notice of one anothers ſpirituall eſtate, that ſo we may the better
know how to do good mutually for one another. This is a
generall dutie whereby way is made vnto other duties.
               2. To keepe others from ſinne. Thus will they bee kept from
being hurt by any temptation.2. Chro. 28. 12, 13. The Captaines of Ephraim, that
ſtood vp againſt them that came from the warre with ſundrie
captiues of Iudah, and ſuffered them not to carrie their captiues
away, render this reaſon, Ye intend to adde more to our ſinnes, and
to our treſpaſſe. Their intent therefore was to keepe their brethren
from ſinne.
               3. To edifie others.
                  1. Theſ. 5. 11. They who are well built vp in grace, are
well armed againſt all temptations. This is an eſpeciall fruite
of loue.1. Cor. 8. 1. For loue edifieth: and that by inſtruction, exhortation, admonition,
and other like duties.
               4. To encourage others againſt their enemies. What a notable
encouragement is this of the Apoſtle,1. Cor. 16. 13. 
                  Watch you, ſtand faſt in the

faith, quit you like men, 
                        •
                     e ſtrong. Another like, but more large
encouragement is ſet downe, Eph. 6. 10, 11, 12, 13, &amp;c. By good
encouragement life and ſpirit is put into men: and they are enboldened
like Lions to ſtand againſt their enemies. For this, the
true grounds of good encouragement muſt bee laid downe:
which are Gods preſence, Gods promiſes, Gods properties, the
neceſſitie of ſtanding out and fighting valiantly, the glorie of
the conqueſt, the damages of yealding, the miſerie of being ouercome,
with the like.
               5. To ſtrengthen the weake.
                  Luke 22. 32. This did Chriſt expreſly giue in
charge to Peter. And this is done not onely by encouragement,
but alſo byRom. 15. 1. 
                  bearing their infirmities, andGal. 6. 2. 
                  burdens. Thus they
which through their owne weakeneſſe might haue bene made
a prey to tempters, may be kept ſafe from them.
               6. To keepe others from falling from the grace of God.
                  Heb. 12. 15. The Apoſtle
aduiſeth to looke diligently hereunto. There is no place of
ſtanding betwixt Gods grace and Satans ſnare: he that falleth
from that, falleth into this.
               7. To reſtore ſuch as fall.
                  Gal. 6. 1. We may not leaue ſuch as are fallen:
for wee pray that they may be deliuered.
                  Deut. 
                        〈◊〉
                      4. The Law teacheth
to helpe vp a beaſt being fallen.1. Cor. 9. 9, 10. 
                  Doth God take care for beaſts?
Or ſaith he it altogether for our ſakes? For our ſakes, no doubt, this is
written.
               
               8. To ſaue the obſtinate with feare.
                  Iude ver. 23. Though men blinded in
mind, and hardned in heart, wilfully giue themſelues ouer
to Satan, yet ought we not to ſuffer them to abide in his clutches.
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     .
But as we would ſnatch, and with violence pull men out
of the fire, ſo ought wee to pull ſuch out of the temptation
wherein they lie.1. Cor. 5. 5. Thus dealt Saint Paul with the inceſtuous
Corinthian,Si, qui in tentationem inciderunt, ceperint infirmitate adprehendi, &amp; agant paenitentiam facti ſui, &amp; deſiderent communionem, vli
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      ſubueniriijs debet. Cypr. epiſl. 3. §. 2. 
                  He deliuered him vnto Satan for deſtruction of the
fleſh, that the Spirit might be ſaued. Was not this to ſaue him with
feare?
               
               9. To receiue the penitent. If a man haue beene ouertaken
with a temptation, and by his repentance manifeſt a recouerie
from the ſame, wee ought ſo to account of him, as if he had not
fallen at all. So S. Paul requireth the Corinthians to receiue the
forenamed inceſtuous perſon: and to forgiue him and comfort
him. This is an eſpeciall meanes to make his deliuerance firme
and ſtable.2. Cor. 2. 7.
               
               
                  
10. To pray for others.
                  Iam. 5. 16. This is the maine duty here intended.See §. 180.
This I referre to the laſt place, becauſe it is a duty which
may be performed when no other can be: euen to ſuch as will
not accept any other duty, of all the reſt it is the moſt effectuall.
            
            
               §. 202. Of the matter of humiliation gathered
out of the laſt Petition.
               
                  Q. VVHat are the things to be bewailed by reaſon of the
Sixt Petition?
               
                  A. 1. Our firſt Parents yeelding to the Diuell.
                  2. Cor. 11. 3.
This is the originall ground of all that ſpirituall ſlauery wherein
we are, and of that need wee haue ſo earneſtly to pray againſt
temptation.
               2. The power,
                  1. Pet. 5. 8. 
                  malice, ſubtiltie, and ſedulitie of Satan. For
Satan is the chiefe Tempter, who hath a finger in all temptations;
in which reſpect the more powerfull, malicious, ſubtill,
and ſedulous he is, the more dangerous is temptation. Not
without cauſe therefore did the diuine voice cry,Reu. 12. 12. 
                  Woe to the inhabitants
of the earth, and of the Sea, becauſe the Diuell is come
downe to you, hauing great wrath.
               
               3. The many ſtumbling blockes in the world.
                  Math. 18. 7. In regard of theſe
Chriſt cryeth,Heu me, quot obſtacula ſeparant, quot prohibent impedimenta? Bern. In Quadr. Serm. 6. 
                  Woe to the world. Theſe are ſo much the more to
be bewailed by reaſon of the deceitfulneſſe of the world
which ſo bewitcheth many, as it draweth them to thoſe ſtumbling
blockes, and maketh them to ſtumble and fall thereat, as
Demas did. Yea on this ground our loue, euen too too inordinate
loue,2. Tim. 4. 10. 
                  of this world is to be bewailed.Iam. 4. 4.
               
               4. The prauitie of our nature.
                  Gen. 6. 5. God himſelfe doth much complaine
hereof. This is it that maketh all manner of temptations,
much more dangerous then otherwiſe they would be.
               5. Our ſpirituall blindneſſe.
                  Reu. 3. 17. By reaſon hereof we cannot diſcerne
the temptations wherewith we are aſſaulted, but are eaſily
led into the midſt of them,2. Kin. 6. 18, 20. as the Aramites were into the
midſt of Samaria,
               
               6. Our fooliſh pro
                        •
                     eneſſe to yeeld to euery temptation,
                  Pro. 7. 7, 8, &amp;c. as the
fiſh to ſnatch at euery bait. Thus are we oft taken.
               
                  
7. The rebellions of ou
                        •
                      fleſh. This maketh vs refuſe all the
meanes which are ſanctified to keepe vs from temptation, and
to take part with the tempters, and ſo to become captiues and
ſlaues vnto them.Rom. 7. 23. 24. This rebellion, and this thraldome doth the
Apoſtle much bewaile.
               8. Preſumption in our ſtrength.
                  Reu. 3. 17. This is bewailed in the Church
of Laodicea.
                  Math. 26. 35. And not without cauſe. For it is the cauſe of many
ones fall. Inſtance Peter, and the other Diſciples.
               9. Inabilitie to ſtand againſt temptations. Of this weakeneſſe
of the fleſh doth Chriſt complaine where hee willeth his Diſciples
to pray againſt temptation.Math. 26. 41.
               
               10. Timorouſneſſe,
                  2. Tim. 4. 16. or immoderate feare of man. This is the
cauſe that by perſecution, yea by threatnings, and reproaches
many are drawne from their holy profeſſion.
               11. Impatiencie. Many croſſes which might eaſily bee borne
by a patient ſpirit, thorow impatiencie proue very hurtfull
temptations.
               12. Prouocations of Gods wrath. Our onely hope, and confidence
of being freed from temptations, or ſo helped againſt
them as they ſhall not ouercome vs, is in God. If God then be
prouoked to wrath, and ſo moued to deny vs his aſſiſtance, and
to giue vs ouer to the power of Tempters, how can wee ſtand?
Vnder this head,Act 7. 52, 52. as all manner of ſinnes, ſo abuſing his mercies,
grieuing his Spirit, deſpiſing his Meſſengers, and ſuch like, are
compriſed.
               Theſe twelue are moſt directly againſt the firſt part of the last
Petition. The other that follow are againſt the other part.
               13.Reu. 2. 4. Loſſe of firſt loue.
               14.2 Pet. 2. 18. &amp;c Back-ſliding from the truth.
               Theſe two, and others like to theſe are directly contrary to
the maine intent of adding the latter clauſe of the laſt Petition
to the former: which is Recouerie from euill. If recouerie from
euill be to be prayed for, is it not a matter much to be bewailed,
that ſuch as are recouered ſhould relapſe, and makeLuke 11. 26. 
                  their laſt
eſtate worſe then the firſt?
               
               15.Mar. 3. 5. Hardneſſe of heart.
               16.Iſa. 53. 1. Infidelitie.
               17.Ezek. 2, 5. Impenitencie.
               
                  
Theſe three, and others like vnto them, make men vncapable
of recouerie. So much the more therefore to be bewailed.
               
                  Q. What other particulars are to be bewailed, vnder the laſt
Petition, in relation to others?
               
                  A. 1.Prou. 7. 21. Inticing others to ſinne.
               2.Ier. 23 14, 17. Encouraging them in ſinne.
               3.Ezek. 34. 4. Diſcouraging the weake.
               4.Gen. 21. 9. Scoffing at grace.
               By theſe and ſuch like meanes men are ſorely tempted.Gal. 4. 29. Now
if wee ought to pray for others that they be not led into temptation,
to leade others into temptation giueth iuſt and great
cauſe of humiliation.
               5.Iob 19. 13. 14, 15. Leauing them that are fallen.
               6.Luk. 7. 39. &amp;c Reiecting the penitent.
               Theſe two branches of vnmercifulneſſe are contrarie to the deſire
and duty of recouering others, intimated in the laſt Branch of the
last Petition, and on that ground to be bewailed.
               Q. What doth the inference of this Sixt Petition vpon the Fift
ſhew to be bewailed?
               
                  A. 1. A dead and naked faith.
                  Iam. 2. 14, &amp;c. In the former Petition faith
in Chriſt for pardon of ſinne is profeſſed. In this Petition a manifeſtation
of the truth of that faith by forſaking ſinne, and by
performing all duties of righteouſneſſe, is intimated. To profeſſe
faith, and not to declare it by the fruits thereof, is much to
be lamented, as a thing diſhonourable to God, diſgracefull to
the Goſpell of Chriſt, aduantageable to Satan, and damageable
to the ſoules of ſuch vaine Profeſſors. S. Iude doth much
bewaile them.Iude. verſe 4. 12, 13.
               
               2.1. Ioh. 1. 8 
                  A vaine-glorious conceit of perfection.
                  Luke 16. 15. Chriſt doth oft
vpbraid this to the Phariſies. This Petition is in vaine preſcribed
to ſuch.
               3. Vngratefulneſſe. When they who dayly ſeeke mercy of
God, take part with the enemies of God: likeHoſ. 2. 2, &amp;c. 
                  Iſrael of whom
the Prophet Hoſea much complaineth.

in the ſixe branches thereof hath beene handled. The

               2. Singly by themſelues.
               In relation to the Petitions this clauſe reſpecteth him who
maketh the Petitions to ſtrengthen his faith, and to enlarge his
deſire. But ſingly conſidered by it ſelfe it reſpecteth God to
whom the Petitions are directed to ſet out the glory of his
name.
               
                  Q. How is the forenamed relation manifeſted?
               
                  A. By this Particle of connexion,
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      Quia. FOR or BECAVSE,
which implyeth a reaſon of all the Petitions: Not as if God
were drawne by reaſons to yeeld to that which otherwiſe hee
would not yeeld vnto. For what God doth, he doth of himſelfe,
becauſe he will do it.Exod. 33. 19. 
                  I will be gracious (ſaith the Lord)
to whom I will be gracious; and I will ſhew mercy on whom I will
ſhew mercy.
                  Epheſ. 1. 11. 
                  He worketh all things after the counſell of his owne
will. For our ſakes therefore is this reaſon added to the Petitions:
and that partly to put anIoel. 2. 13. edge vnto our Prayers, and to
ſharpen them: and partly2. Chro. 14. 11. to put ſtrength vnto our faith,
and to make vs without doubting to expect a gracious grant
of them.
               Q. What doctrine may bee raiſed from the addition of this reaſon.
               
                  A. Prayer is to be preſſed with reaſons. Take a view of the Prayer
of Saints recorded in Scripture, and you ſhall find this aboundantly
proued: for example read the Prayer ofExo. 32. 11. &amp;c. 
                  Moſes,
                  Ioſ. 7. 7, 8, 9 
                  Ioſua,

                  2 Kin. 19. 15. &amp;c. 
                  Hezekiah and others.
               Grounds and reaſons of Prayer being rightly ordered
demonſtrate a neceſſitie of making the Prayer, and great equity

for obtaining the things prayed for: and in that reſpect they
put life, vigour, and feruencie into the ſpirit of him that prayeth,
whereby the prayer commeth to be much more acceptable
and auaileable.
               I earne we hereby to ponder our prayers before wee poure
them forth, and duely to conſider what we aske, why wee aske
that which we aske, what grounds we haue of obtaining our
deſire, that ſo wee may with the greater feruencie of deſire and

our prayer. They who know that their prayers are grounded
on good, iuſt, and weighty reaſons willLuke 18. 7.

               §. 204. Of taking grounds for faith in prayer
from God himſelfe.
               
                  Q. VVHence is the reaſon, vſed in the Lords Prayer,
taken?
               
                  A. From God himſelfe. For the ſumme of it is a declaration
of ſuch things as appertaine to God, and ſhew him to
bee both able and willing to grant ſuch ſuites as are rightly
made vnto him.
               Q. What doctrine doth the kinde of reaſon import.
               
                  A. In Prayer the maine ground of our pleading muſt be fetcht
from God. Well conſider the fore-named prayers ofExo. 32, 11, &amp;c 
                  Moſes,
                  Ioſ 7. 7, &amp;c.

                  —20. 6, &amp;c. 
                  Iehoſaphat,
                  2. Kin. 19. 15, &amp;c. 
                  Hezekiah and others like to them,
and in them all you ſhall finde Gods Couenant, truth, mercie,
power and other like motiues pleaded. In particular take for
this purpoſe ſpeciall notice of Daniels powerfull prayer, thus
expreſſed,Dan. 9. 18, 17. 
                  O my God, encline thine eare and heare, open thine
eyes and behold our deſolations, and the Citie which is called by thy
name. For wee doe not preſent our ſupplications before thee for our
righteouſneſſe, but for thy great mercies. O Lord heare, O Lord
forgiue, O Lord hearken and doe. Deferre not for thine owne
ſake, O my God: for thy Citie and thy people are called by thy name.
Here proteſtation is made againſt any worth in themſelues,

and the name and mercies of God onely are pleaded. And that
for good reaſon. For
               1. In our ſelues there can bee nothing to plead before God
whereby hee ſhould bee moued to grant our deſire. For who
ſeeth not iuſt cauſe to ſay fo himſelfe as Iaakob once did, I am
leſſe then all thy mercies, that is, I am not worthy of the least of all
thy mercies:
                  Gen. 32. 10. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      Pſal. 143. 2. yea and to cry as the Pſalmiſt did, Enter not into
iudgement with thy ſeruant: for in thy ſight ſhall no man liuing be
iuſtified.
               
               2. Out of God there can bee nothing to moue him. For
1. Cor. 4. 7. who hath any thing that he hath not receiued of God?Rom. 11. 36. 
                  Of
him, and through him are all things. Whatſoeuer therefore is in
Prayer pleaded before God muſt bee fetcht from God himſelfe.
               
                  Obiect.
                  Exod. 32. 13. 
                  Moſes in his Prayer pleaded Abraham, Iſaak, and
Iſrael deſiring God to remember them.Pſal. 132. 1, 2. The Pſalmiſt pleadeth
Dauid, his afflictions, his oath, and vow.
                  1. Kin. 20. 3. 
                  Hezekiah pleadeth
his vprightneſſe and integritie.
                  Iſa. 64 9, 10. Pſal. 79. 7. The deſolations of Gods people,
andPſal. 13. 4. the inſultations of their enemies are alſo oft pleaded;
and other like reaſons taken from men.—38 16.
               
               
                  Anſw.
                  —44. 13, 14. The maine force of all theſe reaſons reſteth in God.—80. 6.
For 1 where Abram, Iſaak, Iſrael, and Dauid are named, Gods
Couenant made to them is intended: ſo as no worth in their
perſons, but Gods truth in keeping his Couenant made with
them, is pleaded. 2. where mention is made of his ſeruants
Oath and Vow, the honour and glory which by their oath and
vow was couenanted to God, is meant: ſo as not the worth of
the oath and vow, as mans worke, but the matter thereof,
which tended to Gods glory, is pleaded. The praiſe of God is
in this forme of the Lords Prayer chiefly intended: andPſal. 22. 21, 22. oft
by the Saints expreſſed and pleaded in their prayers,—79. 13. to enforce
the same.—119. 175. 3. Where the integritie and vprightneſſe of any of
Gods Saints is produced in prayer, it is to be conſidered as an
effectuall worke of Gods Spirit, and an vndoubted euidence of
Gods fauour; ſo as no deſert of man, but the ſtampe of Gods
owne worke, and pledge or ſeale of his owne fauour &amp; grace
is pleaded. Beſides reſpect hereby may be had to the truth of
Gods Couenant: as in Hezekiahs caſe. For God had made a

Couenant with Dauid,
                  Pſal. 132. 11, 12. and confirmed it by oath, that his children,
euen the fruit of his body, if they kept Gods Couenant, ſhould
ſit vpon his Throne for euermore. Now Hezekiah being lineally
deſcended from Dauid, and hauing endeauoured in all ſinceritie
to keepe Gods Couenant, was ſo ſicke as he receiued the
ſentence of death before he had a child to ſucceed him on the
Throne of Dauid.
                  1. Kin. 20. 1, &amp;c. Wherefore for ſparing of his life, at leaſt till
hee might haue iſſue, and Gods Couenant thereby bee verified,
hee pleaded his integritie, which was the condition required of
God: hee pleaded it, I ſay, not as a matter of merit, but as an
euidence that the God of truth would make good his owne
word. Gods truth and faithfulneſſe therefore is the ground of
Hezekiahs plea. 4. Where the miſeries, afflictions, and deſolations
of Gods people are vrged in prayer, there Gods pittie
is eſpecially aimed at. For miſery is the obiect of mercie and
pittie. That obiect is laid forth, to giue aſſurance that the God
of pittie will afford ſuccour where ſo fit an obiect for ſuccour is
preſented before him. Yea in this kinde of plea, Gods truth,
and power is alſo aimed at. For the greater the diſtreſſe is, the
more euidently is Gods power manifeſted in giuing deliuerance.
And God hauing promiſed to deliuer his Saints out of
all their troubles, by mentioning any troubles of his Saints vnto
him, his owne promiſe, and his truth in keeping promiſe is
pleaded. 5. Where the inſultations of enemies are preſſed as
a reaſon, the ground of that reaſon muſt needs bee the honour
of God, becauſe ſuch inſultations make to the diſhonour of his
great name. Thus by anſwering theſe obiections diſtinctly,
the truth of the Doctrine is made more cleare, that the onely
true ground of a ſufficient plea in prayer, is in God.
               The grounds of plea which papiſts teach and practiſe muſt
needs be falſe, becauſe they are not taken from God. They
are theſe, Interceſſion of Saints, Bloud of Martyrs, Supererrogatorie
workes of extraordinarie perſons, Merit of a mans own workes,
and others like to theſe. What ſtrength can theſe adde to faith
in prayer? What aſſurance can they giue of being heard, when
they depend on man, and haue no warrant out of Gods
Word?
               We that are better inſtructed, ought to take notice of the

things whereby God hath made himſelfe knowne to vs: being
compriſed vnder this Title theSee §. 20. 
                  name of God. And when wee
come to prayer, meditate thereon ſeriouſly, that our faith being
grounded on ſo ſure a Rocke as God is, and on his promiſes
and properties, wee may with comfort and patience
expect a gracious anſwere, and bleſſed grant of our Petitions.
               
                  The reaſon added to the Petitions being generally touched, It is
further more diſtinctly in the ſeuerall branches thereof to
be handled.
               
            
            
               §. 205. Of appropriating Gods Attributes
to himſelfe.
               
                  Q. HOw is God in this reaſon ſet out?
               
                  A. By his Attributes. For theſe words, Kingdome,
Power, Glory, for euer doe point out foure diſtinct Attributes,
of God, which are
               1.Pſal. 22. 28. Soueraignty. Kingdome.
               
               2.Ier. 32. 17. 2. Chro. 20. 6. Omnipotency. Power.
               
               3.Pſal. 113. 4. Iſa. 6. 3. Excellency. Glory.
               
               4.Pſal. 90. 2▪ Iſa. 57. 15. Eternitie. For euer.
               
               
                  Q. How are theſe Attributes applyed to God?
               
                  A. By a ſpeciall propertie and excellency. So much doth
this Particle THINE and the Article THE import.
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . As if he
had ſaid, Thine and thine onely are theſe. Thine they are originally
of thy ſelfe; and that in an infinite meaſure and degree.
                  1. Tim. 6. 16. In the
ſame manner that the Apoſtle applyeth Immortalitie, may theſe
and all other diuine Attributes bee applyed to God, who onely
hath Kingdome, and Power, and Glory for euer.
               
               Though this Particle THINE, bee but once expreſſed, yet
by vertue of the copulatiue Particle, AND,
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . it is particularly
to be applyed to euery of the other properties.
               As for the fourth Attribute, Eternitie, intimated in this
clauſe, For euer, it is ſo expreſſed, as appertaining to all and euery
of the other three. For Gods kingdome is for euer:
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . his
Power for euer: his Glory for euer: and whatſoeuer elſe is in
God, is, as God himſelfe, for euer. Well therefore may this be

conſidered in relation to other Attributes, as an attribute of
them, and ſimply in it ſelfe as a diſtinct attribute.
            
            
               §. 206. Of Gods hauing all things at
his command.
               
                  Q. VVHat kinde of kingdome is here meant?
               
                  A. Gods vniuerſall kingdome:Of the kinds of Gods Kingdom See §. 35. by vertue
whereof hee hath a ſupreme and abſolute ſoueraignty in all

all kindes vnder it,Pſal. 103. 19. euen his peculiar kingdome alſo, the
Church of Chriſt. In this extent it is ſaid, His kingdome ruleth
ouer all.
               
               
                  Q. What doth this application of kingdome to God, import?
               
                  A. God hath all things at his command. Where Dauid applyeth
this abſolute ſoueraignty to God in the very words
which Chriſt doth,1. Chron. 29. 11, 12. ſaying, Thine is the kingdome, O Lord, he
addeth by way of explication, All that is in heauen and in
earth is thine. Both riches and honour come of thee: and in thine
hand it is to make great, and to giue ſtrength vnto all.
               
               It is God that firſt made all things, and that ſtill vpholdeth,
preſerueth,Rom. 11. 36. and gouerneth all things. Of him, and through him,
and to him are all things.
                  Gen. 14. 22. 
                  Hee is the poſſeſſour of heauen and earth.
All things therefore muſt needs be at his command.
               On this ground we ſee what iuſt cauſe wee haue to make all
the forenamed Petitions vnto God: and of him to aske whatſoeuer
is to be asked in Prayer. For all are at his diſpoſing. The
Pſalmiſt vpon his acknowledgement of Gods ſoueraignty maketh
this inference,Pſal. 44. 4.

               §. 207. Of the abſolute Supremacie of Gods
Soueraigntie.
               Q. VVHat doth the Emphaticall manner of attributing
Kingdome to God (THE Kingdome) import?
               
               
                  A. Gods is the moſt ſupreme and abſolute Soueraignty.
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . THE
KINGDOME, that is, that Soueraignty which may indeed, and
properly be called a Kingdome, which is ouer all, vnder none, is

Gods. Wherefore God is ſtiledPſal. 47. 2. Mal. 1. 14. 
                  A great King:

Kings and Lord of Lords:
                  Pſal. 95 3. 
                  A great King aboue all Gods:

King and Lord of Hoſts: A King who hath theMat. 5. 34, 35. 
                  heauen for his
Throne: and the earth for his footſtoole.
               
               God was before all, euen eternall. Though the creatures ouer
which he raigneth, were not from eternitie, yet had the eternall
God an eternall right of raigning, by vertue whereof hee was
King ouer all things that are ſo ſoone as euer they were. And
this right he muſt needs haue of himſelfe, and by himſelfe. For
he being anIer. 10 10. 1. Tim. 1. 17. 
                  eternall King, who could bee before him, from
whom he might receiue a right of Soueraignty? As he is
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     .

him rather then any other King or Gouernour. This is ſuch a
ruled caſe, ſo cleare and euident, asAct. 4. 19.—5. 29. the Apoſtles made their
enemies Iudges thereof. If a King in his Dominions is to bee
preferred and obeyed before all ſubordinate Magiſtrates:
much more God before all Kings and other Gouernours thorowout
the whole world.
            
            
               §. 208. Of god being King onely.
               Q. VVHat doth the appropriating of Kingdome to God import?
               
                  A. Gods is the onely Kingdome. This Particle THINE (Thine
is the Kingdome) importeth a property. All other Kingdomes

are but parts of his.Rom. 13. 1. 
                  There is no power but of God. The powers that
be are ordained of God.
                  Dan. 5. 21. 
                  Nebuchadnezzar was forced to acknowledge
as much.
               This is to be knowne and acknowledged both to keepe vs
from all baſe, and ſlauiſh obedience to earthly Gouernours in

willingly to obey them in all lawfull things for conſcience ſake,
                  Rom. 13. 5. 1. Pet. 2. 13.
                  for the Lords ſake. If earthly kingdomes be, as they are, within
the limits of Gods kingdome, parts thereof, ſubordinate thereto,
then no obedience muſt bee yeelded to the Gouernours of
them, but that which may ſtand with the Lawes of Gods kingdome:
ſo as God the onely King may bee obeyed therein and
thereby. But in euery thing that may ſtand with the Lawes of
Gods Kingdome, obedience is to be yeelded to Gouernours on
earth, becauſe their Kingdomes are parts of Gods, and they
Gods Deputies and Miniſters.Rom. 13. 2. 
                  Whoſoeuer therefore reſiſteth the
power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God: and they that reſiſt ſhall receiue
to themſelues damnation. Theſe are the grounds that binde
vs to obey Magiſtrates for conſcience ſake. Not that one man
hath power ouer anothers conſcience; this power is Gods Prerogatiue:
but that God to whom all mens conſciences are and
ought to be ſubiect, hath ordained the Powers, and requireth
ſubiection to them. So as that which is done for conſcience ſake,
is done for the Lords ſake.

from all things hurtfull. Aſſurance, I ſay, to ſuch as take
him for their King, and in teſtimonie thereof are readie to performe
all the forenamed duties. Though God be a King ouer

they yeald not to him, by force he keepeth them vnder. To theſe
more terror, then comfort ariſeth from Gods ſoueraignty. But
to his loyall ſubiects much comfort muſt needs ariſe. For their
King hauing all things at his command, will he ſuffer them to
want what he knoweth to be behoouefull for them? or to be
annoyed with any hurtfull thing? All the properties of a good
King are in God. But to prouide for his ſubiects, and to protect
them are properties ſet downe by the holy Ghoſt in the deſcription
of a good King.Pſal. 72, 2, 3, &amp;c. Shall not God, the beſt and chiefeſt

                  A. His abilitie to do any thing. Power attributed
to a creature implieth that abilitie which it hath: ſo it doth
alſo applied to the Creator. Now as other attributes applied to
God are his verie eſſence, and as his eſſence is infinite, ſo alſo
is his power, which extendeth it ſelfe to euery thing that by

power may be done: according to theſe Scripture PhraſesGen. 18. 14.

                  Q. Are all things without exception, within the compaſſe of Gods
power?Reu. 4. 8. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                  
               
               
                  A. Not ſuch things as import impotencie, or imperfection.
Gods power were not omnipotent, but rather impotent, if
thoſe were within the circuit thereof. Such phraſes therefore as
theſe,Tit. 1. 2. 
                  Cannot,
                  Heb. 6. 18. 
                  Impoſſible, are, in relation to thoſe things, applyed
to God.
               Some of the particulars, which by reaſon of omnipotencie,
God cannot do, are theſe.
               1. Matters of contradiction: as one thing at the ſame time to
be and not to be: or one and the ſame thing to be infinite, and finite.
Such things are in their nature impoſſible. And God cannot
eſtabliſh them, becauſe they are againſt truth, and imply
impotencie. For whatſoeuer is, it is by the power of the Creator:
and by his power it is as it is. If withall it be not when it is, or
be contrary to what the Creator maketh it, where is the power
of the Creator? If he himſelfe ſhould bee ſuppoſed to eſtabliſh
ſuch contradictions, he cannot be ſuppoſed to eſtabliſh them by
his power. The one part is by power, the other therefore muſt
be, if it could be, by that which is contrary to power, euen by
impotencie.
               2. Matters of iniquitie: All ſinfull matters. As theſe are contrary
to the will, puritie and perfection of God, ſo they ariſe
from impotencie of vnderſtanding, will, memorie, conſcience,
affection, and actions. By power it is that any either do not, or
cannot ſinne. By weakeneſſe it is therefore that any fall into
ſinne. Theſe emphaticall phraſes (Gen. 18. 25. 
                  Shall not the Iudge of all the
earth do right?
                  Ezek. 18. 29. 
                  Are not the wayes of the Lord equall?
                  Rom. 3. 5. 
                  Is God vnrighteous?
                  —9. 14. 
                  Is there vnrighteouſneſſe with God?) do imply an impoſſibilitie.
So farre is God from ſinne, asIam. 1. 13. 
                  He cannot be tempted
with euill: neither tempteth he any man.
               
               3. Matters of inconſtancie and variableneſſe. By power it is
that one remaineth firme, ſtable, conſtant, inuiolable, vnchangeable.
Weakeneſſe therefore cauſeth the contrary. Of the Almightie

it is ſaid,Iam. 1. 17. 
                  With him is no variableneſſe, neither ſhadow of
turning. Where it is ſaid,1. Sam. 15. 29. 
                  He will not repent, Hee is ſtiled The
ſtrength of Iſrael: Whereby is implyed that it is of ſtrength that
he changeth not. On this ground it is alſo ſaid,2. Tim. 2 13. 
                  God cannot denie
himſelfe.
                  Tit. 1. 2. 
                  God cannot lie.
                  Heb. 6. 18. 
                  It is impoſſible that God ſhould lie.
               
               4. Matters of Paſſion, or ſuffering, as to be mocked, deceiued,
oppreſſed, put to death with the like. Theſe imply a ſubiection
to a ſuperiour power, and in that reſpect an impotencie. Wherefore
it is ſaid of God,Gal. 6. 7. 
                  He is not mocked.
                  Iam. 1. 13. 
                  He cannot be tempted.
The Sonne of God to make himſelfe capable of ſuffering,
which for mans redemption was neceſſarie, aſſumed fleſh,1. Pet. 3. 18. 
                  In
which he was put to death. For in his diuine nature he could not
die, nor any way ſuffer.
            
            
               §. 211. Of the difference betwixt Gods abſolute
and actuall power.
               
                  Q. DOth Gods power actually extend it ſelfe to all things that
by power may be done?
               
                  A. No: not to bring them into act, or to effect
them. Many, many things there be which God is able to do,
that he doth not, no
                     •
                   euer will do.Mat. 26. 53. He could haue ſent his Angels
to haue reſcued Chriſt out of the Iewes hands.—3. 9. He could
out of ſtones haue raiſed children to Abraham. He could haue
made more worlds. He could haue ſent more flouds to deſtroy
the world againe and againe. Hee could haue redeemed the
diuels. Infinite are the things which he could do, but will not
do. Well therefore is Gods power diſtinguiſhed into his Abſolute
and Actuall power.
               Gods abſolute power is that whereby he is able to do whatſoeuer
by power may bee done: as is euident by theſe phraſes,
Luke 1. 37. 
                  With God nothing is impoſſible.
                  Mar. 10. 27. 
                  With God all things are poſſible.
               
               Gods actuall power is that whereby he doth all things that in
his counſell he determineth to do: as it is written,Pſal. 115. 3. 
                  He hath done
whatſoeuer he pleaſed.
               
               Herein lyeth the difference betwixt Gods abſolute and actuall
power, That his abſolute power extendeth it ſelfe beyond his

will, as the fore-named inſtances ſhew. But his actuall power
is bounded within the compaſſe of his will. In this limitation
was he well inſtructed who ſaid to Chriſt,Mar. 1. 40. 
                  If thou wilt thou canſt
make me cleane. And they who ſaid of God,Dan. 3. 17. 
                  Our God whom we
ſerue is able to deliuer vs, &amp;c. Therupon they all ſo truſted to Gods
power, as they ſubiected themſelues to his will.

                     . 
                  And the power?
               
               
                  A. 1. Gods onely is truly and properly power. It is therefore
ſtiledEph. 1. 19. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  A might of power. So as all power compared to his,
is as no power, but very weakeneſſe. His is THE POWER,
that which is worthie to be called power, is Gods.Pſal. 62. 11. 
                  Power belongeth
vnto God.
               
               2. Gods power is beyond all limits. It is
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  an exceeding greatneſſe
of power. To it nothing is impoſſible. By it all things were
made,Eph. 1. 19. and are vpheld and preſerued. By it may all things bee
deſtroyed and brought to nought. The moſt ſtable and inuiolable
courſe that is ſet to any creature, by it may be altered. By
it the Sunne can be madeIoſ. 10. 13. to ſtand ſtill, or2. King. 20. 11. to runne backe, The

and might are in Gods hand: in his hand it is to giue ſtrength
to all.
               
               4. All power is ſubordinate to Gods. This Aſa acknowledgeth
where he ſaith,2. Chro. 14. 11. 
                  It is nothing with thee to helpe, whether
with many, or with them that haue no power. So as,Rom. 8. 31. 
                  If God be for
vs who can be againſt vs?
                  Pſal. 118. 8. 
                  It is better to truſt in the Lord then to put
confidence in man. On theſe and other like grounds well may it
be ſaid to God, THINE IS THE POWER.

reaſon of his power.
               Q. VVHat duties are required by vertue of Gods power?
               A. 1. To put difference betwixt God and all creatures.
In regard of the power of God the Pſalmiſt ſaith, O
Lord God of hoaſts,

proue that none is like to God, he ſetteth out many euidences
of Gods power.
               2. To flie to God in all time of need, and to ſeeke helpe of
him.Mar. 1. 40. As that Leper did of Chriſt, who ſaid, If thou wilt thou
canſt make me cleane.
               
               3. To beleeue Gods word. For he is able to make it good.
Abraham was ſtrong in faith,Rom. 4. 20, 21. being fully perſwaded that what God
had promiſed he was able to performe.

ſtrengtheneth me.
               
               6. To endure patiently all afflictions. So did the ſaid Apoſtle,

able to keepe that which I haue committed to him.
               7. To carrie our ſelues humbly before God.1. Pet. 5. 6. 
                  Humble your
ſelues vnder the mightie hand of God. Gods is a mightie hand: we
muſt therefore be humble vnder it.
               8. To feare God.
                  Mat. 10. 28. Feare him who is able to deſtroy both ſoule and
bodie in hell.
               9. To feare no creature.Pſal. 118. 6. 
                  The Lord is on my ſide: I will not feare:
what can man do vnto me?
                  Dan. 3. 16, 17. On this ground three of the captiues

that is able to do exceeding abundantly,Eph. 3. 20, 21.

promiſes. To ſtrengthen the Prophets faith in the promiſe
which God had made of returning the captiuitie of the Iewes,
God giueth him this anſwer,Ier. 32. 27.

Gods power to ſtrengthen our faith in theſe promiſes following.
               1. The alteration of our corrupt nature.Mar. 10. 23. &amp;c. Though to man it be
as eaſie to make a Camel to go through the eye of a needle, as a

               Q. VVHat is ment by Gods Glorie?
               
                  A. That Excellencie which is in him. For the
Excellencie of a thing, that which cauſeth it to bee in high eſteeme,
and procureth a name, fame, and renoune vnto it, is the
Glory of it. The

                      fama, gloria. Greeke word ſignifieth both fame and
glory. For glory cauſeth fame. In Scripture, glory and excellency
are put for one and the ſame thing: and that in relation both to
creatures, and to the Creator: as, where the Prophet ſpeaking
of the glory of the Church, ſaith,Iſa. 35. 2. 
                  the GLORY of Lebanon
ſhall be giuen vnto it, the EXCELLENCY of Carmel and Sharon.

               §. 216. Of the Incomprehenſibleneſſe of Gods
Glorie.
               
                  Q. MAy Gods glory be comprehended by Man?
               
                  A. No.1 Tim. 6. 16. It is incomprehenſible. It is a light which
no man can approach vnto. For as all other properties of God
are his very eſſence, ſo is his glory which is the excellency of all.
When Moſes deſired God to ſhew him his glory,
                  Exod. 33. 18, 20. the Lord anſwered,
Thou canſt not ſee my FACE for there ſhall no man ſee
MEE and liue. By this anſwer it appeareth that Gods glory is
his face, and his face is himſelfe. For theſe three phraſes applied
to God, glory, face, me, are all put for one and the ſame thing.
And that all theſe are incomprehenſible, this phraſe ſheweth,
Thou canſt not ſee my face. Yet God being willing to gratifie

him, ſo farre as he was capable, ſhewed him his Backe-parts,
ſome glimps of his glory.
            
            
               §. 217. Of the meanes of manifeſting Gods
Glorie.
               Q. HOw is Gods glory manifeſted?
               
                  A. By ſuch meanes as it pleaſeth him to afford. For
meanes he hath afforded in all ages to that purpoſe.
               THeſe meanes haue beene of ſeuerall ſorts. Some extraordinary,
others ordinary: Some more obſcure, others more bright.
               Extraordinary meanes were ſuch particular repreſentations
of Gods glory as at ſundry times were ſhewed to ſonnes of
men, asExo. 16. 10. A brightneſſe in that cloud wherein God was wont to
manifeſt his preſence: and thatEzek. 1. 28, 29 Apparition, or viſion which
was ſhewed to Ezekiel.
               
               Ordinary meanes were thePſal. 26. 8. Tabernacle and the
1 Sam. 4. 21, 22 Arke.
               Other more cleere and bright meanes are his Word, Works,
and Image.
               Both parts of Gods Word, the Law and Goſpell doe clearely
ſet out the glory of God. The Law, the glory of his Iuſtice:
the Goſpell, the glory of his Mercy. Glory therefore is attributed
to them both. The Apoſtle2 Cor. 39. where hee stileth the Law a
miniſtration of condemnation, attributeth glory to it But the Goſpel
which he ſtileth a miniſtration of righteouſneſſe, hee affirmeth
to exceede in glory. This is2 Cor. 3. 18. that glaſſe wherein with open face wee
behold the glory of God.
               
               All Gods works declare his glory: As his workes ofPſal 19 1. Rom. 1. 20. 
                  Creation,
andPſal. 97. 6. 
                  Preſeruation or prouidence. But among the works of
God, they which are more then ordinary workes of wonder, as
all manner ofNum. 14. 22. Ioh. 2. 11. 
                  Miracles,
                  Exod. 15. 11. 
                  Extraordinary iudgements on the
wicked,Pſal. 85. 9. Extraordinary deliuerances of his people, and other
mercies. And moſt principally that exceeding greatneſſe of his
power which he wrought in Chriſt whenRom. 6. 4. 
                  hee raiſed him from
the dead.
               
               The Image of God, which is ſundry waies planted in creatures,
doth euery way ſet out the glory of God: asRom. 3. 23. that Image

after which man was firſt created:
                  2 Cor. 3. 18. that after which man is renewed:
                  1 Cor. 11. 7. that whereby ſuch as are in authority haue ſuperiority,
dignity, and excellency aboue others: andHeb. 1. 3. that which was
ſet in Chriſt made man. The moſt bright and perſpicuous repreſentation
of Gods glory that euer was giuen, was Chriſt
the true, naturall onely begotten Sonne of God, the brightneſſe
of his glory, and the expreſſe Image of his Perſon: of whom
Saint Iohn ſaith,Ioh. 1. 14. 
                  we beheld his glory, the glory as of the onely begotten
of the Father. And Chriſt of himſelfe ſaith,—14. 9. 
                  He that hath
ſeene me hath ſeene the Father. For Chriſtis1 Tim. 3. 16. 
                  God manifeſted in
the fleſh.
               
               Of all places heauen is the place where Gods glory is moſt
conſpicuouſly ſéene. There the fore-named Sonne of God
abideth in his greateſt glory: and there are other meanes of
manifeſting the deuine glory ſo farre as the creature may bee
made capable of enduring the brightneſſe thereof. There it is
ſaid thatAct. 7. 55. 
                  Stephen ſaw the glory of God. There ſhall all the Saints
beIude v. 24. 
                  preſented before the glory of God.
                  1 Cor. 13. 12. 
                  Now wee ſee thorow a glaſſe
darkely: but there face to face. ThereMat. 18. 10. 
                  the Angels alwaies behold
the face of God. And there—22. 30. 
                  wee ſhall bee as the Angells of
God.
               
            
            
               §. 218. How glory is proper to God.
               Q. VVHy is glory by a property with emphaſis applied to
God, thus, And the glory?
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     .
               
               
                  A. 1. The Fountaine of all glory is in God.
That which the Pſalmiſt faith of life, may fitly bee applyed to
glory: with God is the Fountain of glory.
                  Pſal. 36. 9. All excellencies are in
God. Excellency of Maieſty, Excellency of Soueraignty, Excellency
of Purity, Excelleney of Power, Excellency of Wiſedome,
Excellency of Truth, Excellency of Iuſtice, Excellency of Mercy.
He hath them all in himſelfe, thorow himſelfe, for himſelfe:
and that without meaſure, aboue comprehenſion, euen infinitely.
Whatſoeuer excellency is in any creature, it iſſueth out of
this Fountaine. The creature hath all the excellency, which in
any kinde it hath, from this Fountaine, by participation and
communication. All glory therefore is Gods. They glory which

is in himſelfe, and the glory which is in any creature, is
his.
               2. The brightneſſe of Gods glory obſcureth all other glory.Iob. 25. 5.
                  Behold euen the Moone and it ſhineth not: yea the Starr
                        •
                     s are
not pure in his ſight. The glorious Angels are ſaid to haue wings
to couer their faces:
                  Iſa. 6. 2. becauſe the brightnes of Gods glory would
otherwiſe dazle them.Exod 34. 30. If Aaron and the children of Iſrael were
afraid to come nigh to Moſes by reaſon of the ſhining of his
face, how much more may the creature bee afraid to come to
God, by reaſon of the incomprehenſible ſhining of his glorious
face. Where Gods glory ſhineth in his brightneſſe, no other
glory can any more bee ſeene, then the light of a candle in the
middſt of cleare and bright Sun-ſhine. As the light of the Sun
is to the light of Starres, ſo is the glory of the Creator to the
glory of creatures. None of the Stars haue light in themſelues,
but receiue all their light from the Sun. And ſo bright is the
light of the Sun, as, when it ſhineth, the Starres are not ſeene.
On theſe grounds there is great and iuſt cauſe to ſay vnto God,
Thi
                        •
                     e is the glory.
               
            
            
               §. 219. Of Mans giuing glory to God, and taking
glory from God.
               Q. HOw is the creature ſaid toPſal. 29. 1, 2. giue glory to God, or toRom. 1. 23. take
it from him?
               
                  A. Not properly, but reſpectiuely: namely in reſpect of the
creatures minde, and the Creators account. For giuing glory
to God, it is truly ſaid,Ioh. 22. 2. 
                  Can a man bee profitable to God as he that
is wiſe may be profitable to himſelfe? If thou be righteouſe what giueſt
thou to him?
                  —35. 6, 7. 
                  or what receiueth he of thine hand? But he that
doth thoſe things which are pleaſing and acceptable to God,
hath a minde, will and deſire, if it were in his power, to giue
glory to God: and God doth account ſuch a minde, will and
deſire, where there is an anſwerable endeauour, as if indeede
actually and properly glory were giuen to him. This minde
to glorifie and praiſe God is manifeſted by an acknowledgement
of God, and of all his excellencies, by making them
knowne, and by an anſwerable reſpect and carriage. Where

we are exhorted to giue glory to God,
                  Pſal. 96. 3, 7, 9, 10. theſe directions are added,
Declare his glory among the nations. Worſhip the Lord. Feare before
him. Say, the Lordraigneth, &amp;c.
               
               On the contrary ſide, taking glory from God, It is truely
ſaid,Iob 35. 6. 
                  If thou ſiuneſt, what d
                        •
                     ſt thou againſt God? But the ſinner,
eſpecially the wilfull ſinner, whoſe ſinnes are committed directly
againſt the deuine Maieſty, hath a minde, will and deſire,
if it were in his power, to rob God of his glory, and to take it
from him, and God doth ſo account of him, as if by him hee
were indeede actually and properly depriued of glory. To ſuch
he ſaith,Mal. 3. 8. 
                  ye haue rob
                        •
                     ed me In theſe reſpects Glory is taken from
God, whenPſal. 14. 1. he is denied to be, orRom. 1 21. 
                  not glorified as God: or
whenHoſ. 2. 5, &amp;c. that which is due to God is giuen to others, orEzek. 28. 2. 
                  aſſumed to
ones ſelfe. In theſe and other like reſpects God is ſaid to bee
—20. 27. blaſphemed. To blaſpheme, according to the notation of the
originall word, is
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      Transfigere nomen Iebou
                        •
                     . Len. 24, 16. 
                  to hurt ones fame: and in the Law a blaſphemer
is ſaid to ſtrike thorow the Name of the Lord. Not that any
hurt is properly done to God, or to his glorious Name, but that,
if it could bee hurt, they doe what they can to hurt it: or that
they hinder the brightneſſe of Gods glory from ſhining forth
to others: as a man, that cannot take away any whit of light
from the Sun, may notwithſtanding by ſundry meanes hinder
the Sun-ſhine from others.
            
            
               §. 220. Of the duties due to God by reaſon of
his Glorie.
               Q. VVHat duties doth the appropriating of glory to God
import?
               
                  A. 1. ToExod. 20, 3. account him the only true God.
It is his chiefeſt glory to bee a God: yea to bee the onely true
God.Iſa. 42. 8. This glory will he not giue to another. It is therefore
to be reſerued entirely to him.
               2. To aduance him aboue all.Pſal. 113. 4. 
                  The Lord is high aboue all nations:
and his glory aboue the heauens: accordingly hee muſt be
aduanced.
               3. To acknowledge his1 Tim. 6. 16. infinite perfection▪ and that in all
his attributes. Herein his glory conſiſteth. Such phraſes as

theſe, (Pſal. 147. 5. 
                  His wiſedome is infinite:
                  Iſa. 40. 18. 
                  There is no ſearching thereof.
                  Epheſ 1. 19. 
                  The exceeding greatneſſe of his power.
                  Pſal. 108. 4. 
                  His mercy is great aboue
the heauens, and his truth reacheth vnto the cloudes.
                  —36. 6. 
                  His righteouſneſſe
is like the mountaines: his iudgements a great deepe) Such
phraſes as theſe imply an infinite perfection in Gods properties.
               4. To admire his excellency. Glory and excellency is the
onely true cauſe of admiration.Pſal. 8. 1. The conſideration of Gods
ſurpaſſing glory did euen rauiſh Dauids heart with an holy admiration
thereof.
               5. To adore his Maieſty. Adoration is properly due to
Glory, Maieſty, and Excellency. When theEzek 1. 29. Prophet ſaw the
appearance of the glory of God,Reu. 4. 10, 11. 
                  hee fell downe vpon his face:
                  Pſal. 86. 9.
which was the proper geſture of adoration.
               6. To1 Chro. 29. 11, 12. aſcribe the glory of all glory to him. If there be any
glory in vs, glory of dignity, glory of wealth, glory of ſtrength,
glory of any vertue,Pſal. 115. 1. we ought to aſcribe it to him, who is the
Fountaine of all glory, from whom we haue all the glory which
we haue: and not to our ſelues.
               7.Iob. 5. 44. To ſeeke the glory which commeth from God alone,
euen that glory which warranteth, approueth and giueth. For
glory being Gods, God being the Fountaine of all true glory,
that which commeth not from him, is but a ſhew and ſhadow
of true glory.
               8. To abaſe and caſt downe our ſelues at the glorious preſence
of God: asIſa. 6. 5. 
                  Iſaiah did. Thus is Gods glory magnified.
               9. To iuſtifie God and condemne our ſelues in his proceedings
againſt vs, that God may be glorified. So didDan. 9. 7. 
                  Daniel
in the name of all his people. This was it whichIoſh. 7. 19. 
                  Ioſuah intended
when he ſaid to Achan, Giue glory to the Lord, and make
confeſſion to him.
               10. To praiſe God in all things.Pſal. 50. 23. 
                  Who ſo offereth praiſe, glorifieth
God. The nine Lepers that being healed of Chriſt went
away without giuing thanks, are ſaid,Luk. 17. 18. 
                  not to returne to giue
glory to God.
               
               11. To1 Cor. 10. 31. 
                  doe all things to the glory of God. Gods glory ought
to be the Marke whereat we aime in euery thing that wee doe.
               12. To cauſe others to glorifie God. For this end Chriſt
chargeth vs toMat. 5. 16. 
                  let our light ſhine before men.
               
            
            
               
               §. 221. Of the waies whereby others are brought
to glorifie God.
               
                  Q. HOw may others be brought to glorifie God?
               
                  A. 1. By declaring the glory and excellency of
God. Thus may others come to knowledge of God: and ſo to
glorifie him. ThePſal. 66. 2, 4. Pſalmiſt hauing exhorted to ſet forth the
glory of Gods Name, and to make his name glorious, addeth as an
effect thereof, All the earth ſhall ſing to thy Name.
               
               2. ByPſal. 29. 1, 2. inciting and prouoking men to glorifie God. This
was Dauid very diligent to doe. For it putteth a kinde of life
into men, and quickneth them vp the more to doe a duty.
               3. By2 Theſ. 3. 1. furthering the Word of God, and cauſing it to haue
a free paſſage. The Word is a powerfull meanes to make men
glorifie God.
               4. By1 Pet. 2. 9. ſhewing forth the vertue of God in vs.Mat. 9. 8. Chriſt by
this meanes drew on multitudes to glorifie God.
               
               5. ByPhil. 2. 15. ſhining as lights in darkneſſe. Thus1 Pet. 2. 12. they which
ſpeake euill of vs, may be this light be brought to glorifie God.
               6. By conuerting ſinners. When the Gentiles ſo heard the
Word as thereby faith was wrought in them,Act. 13. 48. 
                  they glorified
God. On this groundPſal. 51. 13. 
                  Dauid voweth to teach ſinners Gods
waies.
               
               7. By our owne repentance. When the beleeuing Iewes
heard that God had granted repentance to the Gentiles,Act. 11. 18. 
                  they
glorified God.
               
               8. By manifeſt euidences of entire repentance.Gal. 1. 23, 24. They which
heard that Paul preached the faith that once he deſtroyed (a cleare
demonſtration of his ſound conuerſion) glorified God.
               9. By workes of mercy.2 Cor. 9. 12, 13, 15. Saint Paul was hereby ſtirred vp
to giue thankes to God: And ſaith of ſuch workes, that they are
abundant by many thanksgiuings to God: and that many glorifie
God for liberall contribution vnto them.
               
               10. By fruits of righteouſneſſe. Of theſe it is expreſſely
ſaid,Phil. 1. 11. 
                  they are to the glory and praiſe of God. Men are madeIſa. 61. 3. 
                  trees

of righteouſneſſe, the planting of the Lord that hee might bee glorified.
               
               11. By all manner ofMat. 5. 16. 
                  good workes. They that ſee them will
glorifie God.
               12. By the meaſure of grace anſwerable to the meanes.
Ioh. 15 8. 
                  Herein is my Father glorified if ye beare much fruit, ſaith Chriſt of
ſuch as were trained vp vnder his powerfull miniſtry.
               13. By ſuffering for the truth of God. For1 Pet. 4. 16. 
                  God on their
part who ſuffer is glorified.
               
            
            
               §. 222. Of thoſe who are to ſet forth Gods
Glorie.
               Q. VVHo are bound to ſet forth the glory of God?
               
                  A. 1.Pſal. 103. 20. Angels in heauen. They haue beſt
ability to doe it.
               2.Pſal. 147. 12. Members of the Church. They on earth haue the beſt
meanes to doe it. Such are compriſed vnder theſe titles Ieruſalem,

               3.Mal. 2. 1, 2. Pſal. 135. 19, 20. Miniſters of the Word. Their proper and peculiar calling
it is to glorifie God, and to teach others ſo to doe.
               4.Pſal. 29. 1. Magiſtrates. They beare Gods Image: and on earth
are Gods.
               5.Pſal. 148. 11, 12 All ſorts of people. Young men, Maidens, old men, children
and others. For all haue iuſt cauſe ſo to doe.
               6.Pſal. 150. 6. All liuing creatures. Their life is of God.
               7.Pſal. 148. 8, 9. Senceleſſe creatures alſo: as Fire, haile, ſnow, vapours,
&amp;c. Their being is of God.
               To conclude,Pſal. 145. 9, 10. 
                  Gods tender mercies are ouer all his workes.
Therefore all his workes ſhould praiſe him.
            
            
               
               §. 223. Of the chiefest enemies of
Gods glory.
               
                  Q. VVHo among men are greateſt enemies of Gods glory?
               
                  A. 1.Pſal. 14. 1. Atheiſts, who ſay in their heart, there
is no God.
               
               2.Rom. 1. 23. Pſal. 106. 20. 
                  Idolaters, who change the glory of the corruptible God
into an image made like to corruptible things.

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

name of God.
               9.Reu. 16. 9. All impenitent ſinners. Of ſuch it is ſaid, They repented
not to giue God glory. For by repentance is God much glorified:
and that both by the penitents themſelues, and others.

Power, Glory. The Amplification of them followeth in
this clauſe, For euer.
               
            
            
               § 224. Of Eternitie. To what things it is applyed.
               Q. HOw are the Kingdome, Power, and Glory of God amplified?
               
                  A. By their vnchangeable continuance. This phraſe FOR
EVER implyeth both Eternitie, and Immutabilitie. The phraſe
in the originall, to tranſlate it word for word,
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . in ſecula. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      quaſi 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Ariſt. lib. 1. de coelo. is, for ages:
The originall roote (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ) doth properly ſignifie that which
is for euer. Now becauſe an age is the longeſt vſuall diſtinction
of time, the ſame word that ſignifieth eternity is put for an age.
And when there is no end of that which is ſpoken of, the plurall
number indefinitely without any limitation, thus, for ages,
is vſed to ſet out the euerlaſtingneſſe of it. But euerlaſtingneſſe,
or eternitie is diuerſly vſed in Scripture. For ſuch things are

ſaid to bee for euer, euerlaſting, eternall, which haue both beginning
and end, which haue beginning, but no end, which haue no
beginning yet an end, which haue neither beginning nor end.
               
               1. The things which hauing both beginning and end alſo
are ſaid to be eternall and for euer,1. Such as haue both beginning and end. are 1. Such as haue no ſet
and determinate date. Thus becauſe there was no date ſet for
that heape which was made of the ruines of Ai, neither was
any time of the reedifying of it knowne, it is ſaid to beIoſ. 8. 28. 
                  an
heape for euer.
                  Deut. 13. 16. The like is noted of that heape which was
to bee made of that Citie where Idolaters were harboured.
2 Such as are immutable while their date laſteth. ThusExod. 21. 6. the
things which remained inalterable for the time of a mans life
are ſaid to bee for euer, as the ſeruice of him whoſe eare was
boared thorow with a nawle, by his Maſter: and the things
which endured all the time of the Iewes pedagogie, and politie
till the firſt comming of Chriſt, as theExod. 12. 24. Paſſeouer, and other
like legall Rites: and the things which are to endure till the
end of the world: asGen. 9. 16. the Couenant whereof the Rainbow is
a ſigne, andEccl. 1. 4. the earth. All theſe had their beginning: and
they haue had or ſhall haue their end. Yet are they ſaid to bee
for euer, becauſe no abrogation, or alteration was to be of them,
till their date and end was come.
               2. The things which hauing a beginning haue no end,2. Such as haue a beginning but no end. are
more properly ſaid to be for euer, or euerlaſting; becauſe theſe
phraſes haue eſpeciall reſpect to future continuance. Such are
               1. Good Angels, whoLuk. 20. 36. Heb. 2. 9. 
                  neuer dye: whoMath. 18. 10. 
                  alwayes behold
the face of God.
               
               2. Euill Angels, who areInde, verſe 6. reſerued in euerlaſting chaines.
               
               3. The humane nature of Chriſt: whoſeA. &amp;. 2. 31. 
                  fleſh ſaw no corruption:
and who, euen as man,Heb. 7. 24. 
                  continueth for euer.
               
               4. The ſoules of men,Eccl. 12. 7. which returne to God when the
body which is but duſt returneth to the earth.
               
               5. Mens bodies after the Reſurrection, when1. Cor. 15. 53. 
                  This corruptible
muſt put on incorruption, and this mortall muſt put on immortalitie:
and when1. Theſ. 4. 17. 
                  wee ſhall be euer with the Lord.
               
               6. The higheſt heauen: that place where Chriſt now abideth
in his humane nature, and which is the bleſſed habitation
of the glorious Angels, and glorified Saints. This is ſtiled

                  2. Cor. 51. an eternall houſe:
                  1 Pet. 1. 4 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . an inheritance incorruptible, that fadeth
not away.
               
               7. Hell: the place of the damned, where their worme dyeth
not,
                  Flos quidam qui non marceſſit, dicitur 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Flos iſte adhiberi ſolebat coronis. vide Tibul. lib. 3. El. 4. 
                  and the fire is not quenched (Mar. 9. 44) where their puniſhment
is euerlaſting, Mat. 25. 46.
               8. All things that remaine after the day of Iudgement:
when there ſhall be no more death, Reu. 21. 4.
               3. The things which haue no beginning but an end, are ſuch
decrees of God as were in time accompliſhed. The decree was
in the purpoſe of God before all times,3. Such as haue no beginning but an end. but performed in an
appointed time. Thus grace is ſaid to be giuen before the world
began.
                  2. Tim. 1. 9. The decree of giuing it was before the world: yet the
decree had his date, and was accompliſhed: grace is actually giuen
in the time of this world.
               4. The things which haue neither beginning nor end are
moſt properly eternall.4 Such as haue neither beginning nor end. For herein lyeth a difference betwixt eternitie,
and ſempiternitie or euerlaſtingneſſe. Eternity looketh
backward and forward. It neuer ſaw beginning, nor euer
ſhall ſee end. Euerlaſtingneſſe looketh onely forward to that
which is to come. That which is properly eternall hath his being
of and in himſelfe,Things properly eternall are alſo immutable. being ſupported and ſuſtained by none,
and in that reſpect is immutable. Thus the phraſes which do ſet
out true and proper eternitie, doe alſo by iuſt conſequence
imply immutabilitie. Wherefore vnder this phraſe FOR EVER
here in the Lords Prayer both eternitie and immutability are
compriſed. The things thus properly eternall are onely God
himſelfe and ſuch things as are eſſentiall to him, as his Sonne,
his Spirit, his Properties.
               1. God ſaith of himſelfe, Before mee there was no God formed,
neither ſhall there bee after mee. Iſai. 43. 10. Fitly therefore
doth the man of God ſay vnto him, From euerlaſting to
euerlaſting thou art God, Pſal. 90. 2. The proper name of God

                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      Iod Sheuatum innuit futurum: Holem, praeſens: Lamed He quieſcens in camets, praeteritum. Omnia igitur tempora in ſe continet. Nomen iſtud ſacrum ſic explicat Iohannes Gracè, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Vide Bezaean. not. in Apoc. 1. 4. Iſa. 96. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      Pater aeternitatis 
                  Iehouah doth fully ſet out this propertie, and immutable
eternitie. For it compriſeth vnder it all times, paſt, preſent,
future.
               2. The Sonne of God is called Father of Eternitie, in that, he
is eternall himſelfe, and the author of ſuch things as endure
for euer.
               
                  
3. The Spirit of God in the beginning moued vpon the face of
the waters,
                  Hebrai expo
                     
                        ••••
                      
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      incubabat ſicut gallina ouis ſuis incubat donec pulli gignantur. Gen. 1. 2. He was therefore in the beginning: and
if he was in the beginning, hee had no beginning. For hee it
was that formed the things that had a beginning: in which
reſpect he is ſaid to moue, or (as the Iewish expoſitors interpret
the word) to ſit as an Hen vpon her Egges, till her Chickens
be hatched.
               4. All the properties of God are, as theſe three, (Kingdome,
Power, Glory) for euer.
               
               His Dominion is an euerlasting Dominion, Dan. 7. 14. euen
from generation to generation, Dan. 4. 31.
               His Glory is eternall, 1. Pet. 5. 10.
               His righteouſneſſe is an euerlaſting righteouſneſſe, Pſal. 119.
142.
               His truth is for euer, Pſal. 117. 2.
               His mercy is for euer, Pſal. 136. 1.
               So alſo his Counſell, Law, Oath, Couenant and the like,
whereof ſee §. 226.
               Thus we ſee that eternitie properly taken,Difference betwixt Gods eternitie and creatures. is proper to God.
Howſoeuer other things are alſo stiled eternall, yet there is a
manifeſt difference betwixt that which is proper to God, and
that which is common to creatures.
               1. Gods Eternitie is without beginning. So is no creatures.
For by him were all things created that are in heauen,Col. 1. 16. and that are
in earth, viſible and inuiſible.
               2. Gods is without alteration. So is no creature as wee ſhall
§. 227. afterwards ſhew.
               3. Gods is independent. Hee euer was, and euer remaineth
to be of himſelfe, and by himſelfe. Creatures haue their continuance
of God,Act. 17. 28. and by God. In him wee liue, and moue, and
haue our being.
                  Rom. 11. 36, 
                  Of him, and through him, and to him are all
things.
               
            
            
               
               § 225. Of the Duties which ariſe from
Gods Eternitie.
               Q. VVHat duties doth that Eternitie which is proper to
God teach vs?
               
                  A. 1. To acknowledge him to be the onely
Creator.Ioh. 1. 
                        •
                     2 3. By the eternitie of Chriſt doth S. Iohn proue that
he is God, and that all things were made by him.
               
               2. To ſeeke preſeruation of him. On this ground the Pſalmiſt
thus prayeth,Pſal. 102. 24. 
                  O my God take mee not away in the middeſt of
my dayes: thy yeares are throughout all generations.
               
               3. To giue the praiſe of continuance of all good to him. It
was vſuall with the Pſalmiſt to giue thankes to God,Pſal. 136. 
                  becauſe
his mercy endureth for euer.
               
               4. To aſcribe eternall glory to him that is eternall. This
phraſe is frequent among the Saints, To God bee glory for euer
and euer.
                  2. Tim. 4. 18.
               
               5. In our time to ſerue him. Thus doe wee what lyeth in our
power to continue ſeruice to the Eternall for euer. If all generations
were carefull euery one in their time to ſerue God, the
mortalitie of man would be no hindrance to the perpetuitie of
Gods ſeruice. Abraham called vpon the name of the euerlaſting
God.
                  Gen. 21. 33. Becauſe the Lord was an euerlaſting God, Ahraham was
carefull in his time to worſhip him.
               6. To make him knowne to poſteritie. This is a further
meanes of procuring an euerlaſting name to the euerlaſting
God. For our poſteritie being inſtructed by vs, may declare
Gods name to their poſteritie: and ſo poſteritie to poſteritie
throughout all generations. Marke theſe things (ſaith the Pſalmiſt)
that ye may tell it to the generations following:Pſal. 48. 13, 14. 
                  For this
God is our God for euer and euer.
               
               7. To depend on him for our poſteritie. Wee are mortall,
and ſhall not euer liue to prouide for our poſteritie. But God
remaining for euer wee may well commend ſuch as ſuruiue vs
to his prouidence, and depend on him for his care ouer them.
The Pſalmiſt hauing made acknowledgement of Gods euerlaſting

                  and thy yeares ſhall haue no end, he maketh this inference, The
children of thy ſeruants ſhall continue: and their ſeed ſhall be eſtabliſhed
before thee.
               
               8. To feare him more then creatures. Creatures though neuer
ſo mighty, and malicious may die, &amp; we be freed from feare
of them.Pſal. 92. 8, 9. But God euer liueth. Thou Lord art moſt high for euermore,
but thine enemies ſhall periſh.
               
               9. To preferre him before all. To ſhew what iuſt cauſe
there is to preferre God before all, thus ſaith the Lord of himſelfe,
Before me there was no God formed, neither ſhall there bee
after me.
                  Iſa. 43. 10.
               
               10. To follow after righteouſneſſe.
               11. To turne others to righteouſneſſe.Dan. 12. 3.
               
               For both theſe ſhall ſhine,Math. 13. 43. the one as the Firmament, the other
as the Starres in the Kingdome of God, for euer and
euer.
               
               12. To hope in death.1. Theſ. 4. 13, 14. &amp;c.
               
               13. To be comforted for thoſe that die in the Lord. For the
eternall God will raiſe vp both vs and others beleeuing in him,
to eternall life.
               Thus much of Gods Eternitie plainely expreſſed vnder this
phraſe, for euer. His Immutabilitie is alſo imployed
thereby.
            
            
               §. 226 Of immutabilitie: to what things it
may be applyed.
               
                  Q. VVHat, beſides Eternity, is implyed vnder this clauſe
FOR EVER.
               
               
                  A. Immutabilitie. That which euer remaineth
the ſame without any alteration is moſt properly ſaid to be
for euer.
                  Pſal. 102. 27. Wherefore of God it is ſaid, Thou art the ſame, and thy
yeares ſhall haue no end. His immutability and eternity are both
ioyned together.
               As eternitie, ſo alſo immutabilitie is diuerſly taken in Scripture.
For
               1. Many things are ſaid to be vnchangeable,1. Things immutable by voluntarie appointment. becauſe by voluntary
appointment they are ſo ordered: as
               
                  
1. Sundry Lawes and Statutes.
                  Dan. 6. 15. The Law of the Medes and
Perſians was, that no Decree, nor Statute which the King eſtabliſheth,
may be altered.
               2. Laſt Wills and Teſtaments.
                  Gal. 3. 15. No man diſanulleth a Teſtament,
or addeth thereto, if it be confirmed.
               3. Sacred Vowes of ſuch as haue power to make them.Num. 30. 3. &amp;c.
Indeed an husband had power in ſundry caſes, and with due
cautions to diſanull his wiues vow: and a father, his daughters
vow. But otherwiſe the Law is ſtrict in this caſe, When
thou ſhalt vow a Vow vnto the Lord thy God, thou ſhalt not ſlacke
to pay it.
                  Deut. 23. 21.
               
               4. Things conſecrated.Pro. 20. 25. 
                  It is a ſnare to a man to deuoure that
which is conſecrated.
                  Ezek. 48. 14. The firſt fruites of the Lord might not
be ſold, exchanged or alienated, becauſe they were holy to the
Lord▪
                   conſecrated to him.
               5. Lawfull oathes.Mat. 5. 33. Theſe muſt be kept, though they bee
made to a mans hurt.Pſal. 15. 4.
               
               6. The bond of mariage.Mat. 19. 6. Hereof it is ſaid, What God hath
ioyned together let no man put aſunder.
               
               2. Other things by cuſtome become immutable: as
               1. Euill practiſes.
                  Ier. 13. 23. Can the Ethiopian change his skin? or the
Leopard his ſpots? then may ye alſo do good that are accuſtomed to
do euill.
               2. Ciuill ordinances.
                  Mat. 27. 15. At the Paſſeouer the Gouernour was
wont to releaſe vnto the people a priſoner whom they would: thereupon
it is ſaid, Of neceſſitie he muſt deliuer one to them.Luke 23. 17.
               
               3. Sundry things are made immutable by ſpeciall ſupportance:
as
               1. Coeleſtiall ſpirits.Eph. 1. 10. Theſe are the things in heauen which
are ſaid to be gathered together in Chriſt: by whom they are
confirmed and eſtabliſhed.
               2. The Church militant.
                  Mat. 16. 18. 
                  For the gates of hell ſhall not preuaile
againſt it.Pſal. 125. 1.
               
               3. Particular Saints.
                  Rom. 11. 29. They that truſt in the Lord ſhall bee as
mount Sion which cannot be remoued, but abideth for euer.
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                        •••
                     ſmodi ſunt vt eorum ipſum

               4. The gifts and calling of God. Theſe are without repentance:
Such as God neuer repenteth the beſtowing of them.
On this ground the Apoſtle thus ſaith of ſuch as were called

and made partakers of the gift of God,Phil. 1. 
                        •
                     . 
                  I am confident of this
very thing, that he which hath begun a good worke in you, will performe
it vntill the day of Ieſus Chriſt.
               
               4. There are many things which haue an immutable nature
giuen them: ſo as according to that courſe which God hath
appointed, they cannot be altered: as
               1. Sundry natiue properties.
                  Ier. 13. 23. Can the Ethiopian change his
skin?Mat. 5. 36. or the Leopard his ſpots? Thou canſt not neake one haire
white or beatke.
               2. The earth and the mountaines thereon.Eccl. 1. 4. Theſe abide for
euer.
                  Pſal. 125. 1.
               
               3. Seaſons and intercourſe of times.
                  Gen. 8. 22. While the earth remaineth,
ſeed-time, and harueſt, and cold, and heate, and ſummer, and
winter,Ier. 33. 20. and day, and night ſhall not ceaſe. Thus ſaith the Lord, If
ye can breake my couenant of the day, and my couenant of the night,
and that there ſhould not be day or night in their ſeaſon, Then, &amp;c.
Here the immutable entercourſe of thoſe ſeaſons is ſet
downe as an vndeniable principle.
               
               4. The viſible heauens and the hoſt thereof.Ier. 31. 35. 
                  The Lord giueth
the Sunne for a light by day, and the ordinances of the Moone and
of the Starres for a light by night: namely, ſo to abide without alteration.
               5. The higheſt heauen and all therein.Mat. 6. 20. 
                  There neither moath
nor ruſt corrupt, nor theeues breake through, nor ſteale.
               
               5. Some things are eſſentially in themſelues immutable: and
ſo immutable as it is impoſſible they ſhould be changed: as
               1. God himſelfe. Mal. 3. 6. Iam. 1. 17.
               2. Gods counſell. Pſal. 33. 11. Heb. 6. 17.
               3. Gods Law. Luke 16. 17.
               4. Gods oath. Pſal. 110. 4. Iſa. 45. 23.
               5. Gods couenants. Ier. 33. 20, 21.
               6. Gods promiſes. Heb. 6. 13, 18.
               7. Euery word of God. Num. 23. 19.
               8. Gods loue. Ier. 31. 3.
               As God himſelfe is, ſo are the things which are eſſentiall to
him, and come out of him, as thoſe which are before mentioned,
and others like vnto them, immutable, inuiolable.
               
            
            
               
               §. 227. Of the difference betwixt the immutabilitie
of the Creator and creatures.
               Q. WHerein lyeth the difference betwix
                     •
                   the immutability
of the Creator, and of the creaturcs?
               
                  A. 1. God hath his ſtabilitie of himſelfe:
which is euident by this ſtile which God giueth to himſelfe, I
AM THAT I AM.Exod 3. 14. Creatures haue all that ſtabilitie which
they haue of God.Ier. 31. 35. 
                  The Lord giueth the ordinances of the Moone,
and of the Starres: hee hath appointed them the courſes which
they keepe ſo conſtantly.Prou. 3▪ 19. 
                  He hath founded the earth, and eſtabliſhed
the heauens.
               
               2. It is ſimply and abſolutely impoſſible that Gods ſtabilitie
ſhould be altered.Heb. 6. 18. But the moſt ſtedfaſt ſtabilitie of the creatures
may be altered.Iude ver. 6. Some of the Angles kept not their firſt eſtate.
The Lord remoueth the mountaines and ouer turneth them in his anger:
                  Iob 9. 5, 6, 7.
                  He ſhaketh the earth out of her place, and maketh the pillars thereof
tremble. He commandeth the Sunne and it riſeth not, &amp;c. In Ioſhuahs
time the Sunne ſtood ſtill.Ioſ. 10. 13. In Hezekiahs time it runne backe.
Though many creatures neuer were nor ſhall be changed,2. King. 20. 11. as the
good Angell, yet is it not ſimply impoſſible that they ſhould be
changed. Hee that made them can deſtroy them. If God in
Chriſt had not confirmed them, but ſhould leaue them to themſelues,
there might be feare of their falling.
               3. God remaineth immutable by himſelfe.Mal. 3. 6. 
                  I am Iehouah, ſaith
the Lord, I change not. Becauſe hee is Iehouah, of himſelfe, by
himſelfe, therefore he changeth not. But the creatures are ſupported
by God, and kept ſtable and vnchangeable by his prouidence.
As the Lord firſt appointed them their firme and ſtable
courſe, ſo, that they may the better keepe it, he putteth vnder
the hand of his diuine prouidence to ſupport them.Col. 1. 17. By him
all things conſiſt. The immutabilitie therefore which is in any
creature is wholy at Gods diſpoſing, either to confirme, or alter
it. So as immutabilitie properly taken, is proper to God.
            
            
               
               §. 228. Of the duties which ariſe from Gods
immutabilitie.
               
                  Q. TO what duties are we bound by reaſon of Gods immutabilitie?
               
                  A. 1. To put difference betwixt the Creator
and creatures: as the Pſalmiſt did, where in oppoſition betwixt
the Creator and creatures he ſaith,Pſal. 102. 26. 
                  They ſhall periſh, but thou ſhalt
endure, &amp;c.
               
               2. To reſpect God as Saints in former times haue done. He
is the ſame God now that euer he was. Why then ſhould he not
be accordingly eſteemed.Mal. 3. 4, 5. 6. This argument taken from Gods
immutabilitie doth God himſelfe vſe to prouoke to pietie, &amp; to
reclaime them from all impietie.2. Chro. 17. 3. 4. True Saints haue alſo hereby
bene moued to carrie themſelues towards God,—29. 2. as their fathers
of old haue done.—34. 2, 3.
               
               3. To truſt in the Lord.Pſal. 125. 1, 2. 
                  As the mountaines round about Ieruſalem
ſtand vnmoueable for the defence and ſaferie thereof, So
the Lord is round about his people for euer.
               
               4. To beleeue Gods word and promiſe. Sarah beleeued
Gods word euen againſt the ordinarie courſe of nature, Becauſe
ſhe iudged him faithfull who had promiſed.
                  Heb. 1
                        •
                     . 11.
               
               5. Confidently to waite for ſaluation. For this end hath God
ſhewed to the heires of promiſe the immutabilitie of his counſell, that
we might haue a ſtrong conſolation, &amp;c.
               6. To hold cloſe to Gods word: not to alter it any way.Deut 4. 2.
Who ſhall dare to change the inuiolable word of the immutable
God?
               7. To yeald to the counſell of God made knowne. God in
his counſell is vnchangeable. It ſhall ſtand: whether we yeald
vnto it, or repine againſt it. On this ground1. Sam. 3. 18. the Saints, where
the purpoſe of God was manifeſted,2. Sam. 12. 22, 23▪
                   humbly ſubmitted themſelues
thereto.2. King 20. 19.
               
               8. To be ſtedfaſt,1. Cor. 15. 58. conſtant, and vnnioueable in euery good
worke.Mat. 5. 48. This is one eſpeciall point wherein we muſt be perfect
as our heauenly Father is perfect.
               
               Some of thoſe particulars wherein we muſt be vnmoueable

and immutable are theſe.
               1. In our promiſes. 2. Cor. 1. 17.
               2. In our oathes. Pſal. 15. 4.
               3. In our vowes. Eccl. 5. 4.
               4. In our faith and hope. Col. 1. 23.
               5. In our profeſſion. Heb. 3. 12. &amp; 13. 9.
               6. In all good duties. Gal. 6. 9.
               Hitherto of the Attributes here appropriated to God ſingly and
ſeuerally conſidered by themſelues. The relation which
they haue to the Petitions is further to be declared.
            
            
               §. 229. Of Gods kingdome. How it worketh confidence
in Prayer.
               
                  Q. VVHat relation haue the forenamed properties of God to the
Petitions of this prayer?
               
                  A. As reaſons to enforce them:See §. 203. which they do by giuing vs
aſſurance of obtaining them: which will more clearely appeare
by a diſtinct application of euery particular propertie to the Petitions:
and of euery particular Petition to the ſeuerall properties.
               Q. How doth Gods Soueraigntie giue vs aſſurance of obtaining our
Petitions?
               
                  A. It importeth Gods willingneſſe to heare vs. This is a great
encouragement to moue vs to come to God, and to expect a
gracious anſwer from him.Pſal. 65. 2. Vpon this ſtile giuen to God, O thou
that heareſt prayer, this inference is made, vnto thee ſhall all fleſh
come. Now Gods willingneſſe and readineſſe to heare may well
be gathered from this clauſe, Thine is the kingdome, becauſe it is
the propertie of good Kings readily to open their eares to
their ſubiects ſuites, as is excellently ſet downe in thePſal. 72. 12, 13, 14. deſcription
of that King that was a type of Ieſus Chriſt the King of
kings. But God hath all the properties of a good King in him.
Yea they are all originally in him, as in the head, fountaine and
well-ſpring. The properties that are in other good Kings are
deriued from him. He hath them infinitely aboue all meaſure.
We may well therfore be aſſured that the kingdome being Gods,
he being our King and Soueraigne, we may boldly preſent our

ſuites to him, and confidently expect the accompliſhment of
our deſires. Well did he know this, that did vſually in his Petitions
to God, ſtile him King, ſaying, Hea
                        •
                     ken vnto the voice of my
crie,
                  Pſal. 5. 2. 
                  my KING. Thou art my KING O God: command deliuerance
for Iaakob.—44. 4. 
                  God is my KING of old working ſaluation. Wherfore
take due and true notice of thine eſtate,—74. 12. whether thou bee
indeed one of Gods ſubiects, that ſo thou maiſt with the more
ſtedfaſt faith preſent thy Petitions to God as to thy King, and
plead and preſſe this argument, Thine is the kingdome.
               
            
            
               §. 230. Of Gods power. How it ſtrengthenth
faith in Prayer.
               Q. HOw doth Gods power enforce our deſire?
               
                  A. It ſheweth how able God is to grant whatſoeuer
we deſire of him. A King may be ready and
willing to heare his ſubiects ſuits, but if withall hee be not able
to grant their Petitions, and to effect their deſires, what confidence
can they haue in calling vpon him? when a poore ſubiect
thus cryed to a mortall King,2. King. 6. 26, 27. 
                  Helpe, ô Lord, my King: he anſwered,
If the Lord do not helpe thee, whence ſhall I helpe thee? What
heart can a ſubiect haue to go to ſuch a Soueraigne? There may
be more hope of helpe from him that is vnwilling, then from
him that is vnable.Ier. 32. 17, 27. Oſt therefore is Gods power alledged to
ſtrength
                     •
                  n our faith in prayer:2. Chro. 20. 6. and Saints themſelues were

                     •

                  A.
                  Gods power ſingly by it ſelfe no ground of faith. No:§. 
                        •
                     11. wee haue before ſhewed that God is able to do
many things which he will not do. ThoughMat. 26. 53. Chriſt knew that
his Father could haue ſent more then twelue legions of Angels
to reſcue him, yet becauſe he alſo knew that it was the will of
his Father at that time to deliuer him into the hands of his enemies,
he would not pray for thoſe legions to be ſent. Though
God be able at any time to preſerue any people from any iudgment,
yet when his will is not to deliuer them, the prayers of
Ezek. 14▪ 14. 
                  Noah, Daniel, and Iob, or ofler. 15. 1. 
                  Moſes, and Samuel, ſhall not be of
force for them.1. Sam. 16. 1. 
                  Samuel prayed for Saul, but was not heard.
               
                  
Q. How then is Gods power a ground of faith?Gods power and will concurring a ſure ground of faith
               
               
                  A. In that it is ioyned with his willingneſſe. Therefore it is
here added to his kingdome,§. 229. which wee haue ſhewed to ſet
out his readineſſe to heare. They who place their confidence
on Gods power aright, are not ignorant thereof. Inſtance the
Leper,Math. 8. 2. who thus frameth his Petition, Lord, if thou wilt,
thou canſt make me cleane. In thoſe things whereof we haue euidence
for Gods willingneſſe, we may with confidence reſt vpon
Gods power for the obtaining of them. Wherefore, well acquaint
thy ſelfe with Gods Word, and with his promiſes therein,
that thereby thou maiſt bee well inſtructed in the things
which God is willing to grant, and ſo with greater confidence
truſt to his power.
            
            
               §. 231. Of Gods glory. How it ſetleth the ſoule
for obtaining her deſire.
               
                  Q. HOw doth Gods glory encourage vs, with confidence to call
on God?
               
                  A. It implyeth a concurring of his will and power together.
Gods glory is the maine end that he aimeth at in all things.Prou. 16. 4. 
                  The
Lord hath made all things for himſelfe: namely, to ſet out his glorie.
The things therefore which tend to his glory hee will aſſuredly
grant. For they are none of thoſe things which were§. 210. before
noted to import impotencie, or imperfection: and in that
regard are within the compaſſe of his power. But they are the
things which God aimeth at, &amp; which hee hath ordained to be
done: &amp; in that regard, no doubt can be made of Gods willingnes
to grant them. Seeing then that God is able to do whatſoeuer he
is willing to do: And ſeeing that whatſoeuer God is able &amp; willing
to do ſhall be done: and ſeeing that the things which tend to Gods
glory God is both able and willing to do, wil not this concluſion neceſſarily
follow fiō thoſe premiſes, The things which are asked of
God for the glory of God ſhal aſſuredly be granted? How fitly therfore
doth Chriſt hauing preſcribed ſundry Petitions, which all
tend to the glory of God, teach vs to put God in minde of his
glory for ſtrengthening our faith in obtaining them? That this
motiue taken from Gods glory, may rightly bee vſed in prayer,

and thy faith be ſtrengthened thereby, be ſure that all the Petitions,
which thou preferreſt to God, do make to Gods glory.
Let them not bee to ſatisfie thy luſts:
                  Iam. 4. 3. So thou maiſt aske and not
receine.
               
            
            
               §. 232. Of Gods vnchangeable Eternitie. How
it maketh vs reſt on God for obtaining
our deſires.
               Q. HOw doth Gods vnchangeable eternitie enbolden vs in
faith to call vpon God?
               
                  A. It maketh vs confidently to expect what
God hath formerly granted: and to doe for vs that which
hee hath alwayes done for them that haue called on him, and
beleeued in him. On this ground the Pſalmiſt thus pleadeth,
Our fathers truſted in thee:
                  Pſal. 22. 4, 5. 
                  they trusted, and thou didſt deliuer
them: They cryed vnto thee, and were deliuered: they truſted in
thee, and were not confounded. This pleading of Gods former dealings
implyeth faith in Gods vnchangeable continuing to bee
the ſame God: the ſame God in our time, that he was of old in
our fathers time: the ſame God to vs, that hee was to our fathers.
Pſal. 74. 13, &amp;c. On this ground it hath beene vſuall with Saints to call
to minde,—77. 11, 12, &amp;c and to make mention of Gods former dealings with
others before their time,2. Chro. 20. 7. when they called vpon GOD, to
ſtrengthen their faith; and toPſal. 105. 5. call on others to remember the
ſame. The Prophet rendereth this reaſon, of declaring Gods
former dealings, to poſteritie,Pſal. 78. 7. 
                  That they might ſet their hope in
God. Were not the Kingdome, Power, and Glory Gods FOR
EVER, Were not God euer the ſame God, this argument taken
from Gods former fauours, and Gods former workes, would
be of little force to make ſucceeding ages to truſt in him.
Wherefore that all ages might in faith call vpon God, and
with confidence depend on him to be heard and helpt: yea that
they who haue once beene heard and helpt might hold on in
calling vpon God and ſeeking helpe of him euery day, euen all
the dayes of their life, fitly doth the Lord adde this clauſe FOR
EVER, to ſet out the immutable eternitie of God himſelfe, and

of all his properties, as of his Soueraignty, Omnipotencie, and
Excellencie. Oft meditate hereon, that thou maiſt with as
ſtrong confidence call on God as Abraham, Dauid, the Prophets,
Apoſtles, and other Saints haue done: but with this Prouiſo
that thou endeuour to be ſuch as they were, and ſo to call
on him as they did: for God for euer remaineth the ſame: and
caſteth his gracious eye vpon the ſame kinde of perſons.
               Thus much of the application of the particular properties of God
to all the Petitions in generall. Each Petition ſhall further
be applyed to each propertie.
            
            
               §. 233. Of the ſpeciall relation which the ſeuerall
Petitions haue to the Kingdome
of God.
               Q. VVHat particular reſpects hath euery of the Petitions
to Gods Kingdome?
               
                  A. 1. It appertaines to a King to haue his

                     •
                  onour aduanced.Math. 5. 35. The Lord forbiddeth to ſweare by Ieruſalem
becauſe▪ 
                  it is the Citie of the great King: ſo as the things of
the great King muſt not be profaned: the King is diſhonoured
thereby, which he will not brooke. The Lord will giue ſtrength
to his King, and exalt the horne of his anointed, It is fit for a King
to be exalted, and haue his name hallowed. Good ground therefore
there is to make this Petition, Hallowed be thy name, to him
whoſe the kingdome is.
               
               2. It cannot bee doubted but that a King will maintaine his
Kingdome. It belongeth to him ſo to doe. Who ſhould doe it,
if not he?Zac. 9. 9, 10. Hereupon the Prophet exhorteth Zion to reioyce
in the comming of her King: for comming to his owne kingdome,
hee commeth with ſaluation. Well therefore may wee
ſay to him whoſe the Kingdome is, Thy Kingdome come.
               
               3. Obedience is moſt due to a King. Of Chriſt the King of
the Church it is foretold that All Kings ſhall fall downe before
him:
                  Pſal 72. 11. 
                  All Nations ſhall ſerue him. Yea wee are commanded to
ſerue him,
                  Pſal. 2. 6, 11. becauſe hee is a King. Ought wee not then to make
to him, whoſe the kingdome is, this Petition, Thy will bee
done?
               
               
                  
4. A King prouides all needfull things for his Subiects. So
much is noted in the deſcription of a good King,Pſal. 71. 6, 7. 
                  He ſhall come
downe like raine vpon the mowen graſſe, and as ſhowers that water
the earth: In his dayes ſhall be aboundance of peace. May wee
not now pray thus, Giue vs this day our dayly bread, to him
whoſe the kingdome is?
               
               5. It is in the power of the higheſt to forgiue. If the King grant
a Pardon to a Traitor, who can condemne him? Chriſt ſitting
in iudgement, to ſhew what authoritie hee had to abſolue and
condemne,Mat. 25. 34, 41. ſtileth himſelfe King. The KING ſhall ſay, Come ye
bleſſed, &amp;c. and He ſhall ſay depart you curſed, &amp;c. Great reaſon
therfore there is thus to pray, Forgiue vs our debts, to him whoſe
the kingdome is,
               
               6. It is a Kings Office to deliuer his Subiects from their enemies,
and from the euils which may befall them. Fitly to this
purpoſe ſaith the Prophet.Zeph. 3. 15. 
                  The Lord hath taken away thy iudgements:
hee hath caſt out thine enemies: The King of Iſrael, euen
the Lord is in the middeſt of thee: thou ſhalt not ſee euill any more.
We haue therefore iuſt cauſe to ſay, Leade vs not into temptation,
but deliuer vs from euill, to him whoſe the Kingdome is.
               
            
            
               §. 234. Of the ſpeciall relation which the ſeuerall
Petitions haue to Gods power.
               
                  Q. VVHat particular reſpect hath euery of the Petitions
to Gods power?
               
                  A. 1. To haue Gods name rightly and duely hallowed requireth
a diuine power.Pſal. 24. 8. 
                  The Lord ſtrong and mighty, is the King
of Glory. Wherefore to hallow Gods name muſt bee deſired and
expected of him whoſe the power is.
               
               2. Gods Kingdome can not bee perfected but by almightie
power. For many and mighty are the enemies thereof. Few,
and weake are the true members and friends thereof. They
therefore that ſpeake of the glory of Gods kingdome,
                  Pſal. 145. 11. 
                  talke of his
power. So as this Petition, Thy kingdome come, is to bee made to
him, whoſe the power is.
               
               3. By a ſtrong hand it is that mortal ſinful men are brought to
do Gods will.Mar. 10. 27. 
                  With men it is impoſſible. To him therefore whoſe

                  the power is, it is requiſite thus to pray, Thy will be done on
earth.
               
               4. All our neceſſities cannot bee fupplied but by a diuine
power.2. King 6. 27. A King was forced to ſay, If the Lord helpe thee not,
whence ſhall I helpe thee? out of the barn-floore, or out of the
wine-preſſe?
                  2 Cor. 9. 8. But God is able to make all grace abound towards
you, that ye alwaies hauing all ſufficiency in all things, may abound
to euery good worke. As therefore wee would haue our deſire
granted, ſo let vs ſay, Giue vs this day our daily bread, to him,
whoſe the power is.
               
               5. Whether is it eaſier to ſay to the ſicke of the palſie,
                  Mar 2. 9. 
                  Thy ſinnes
are forgiuen thee, or to ſay, Ariſe, and take vp thy bed and walke?
Both are done by the ſame power, which is diuine, omnipotent.
Make therefore to him whoſe the power is this Petition, Forgiue
vs our debts.
               
               6. To bee able to ſtand againſt the aſſaults of Satan,Epheſ. 6. 10. &amp;c. is aboue
the ability of fleſh and blood. To him therefore whoſe the power
is, wee muſt pray, Leade vs not into temptation, but deliuer vs from
euill.
               
            
            
               §. 235. Of the ſpeciall relation which the ſeuerall
Petitions haue to Gods glorie.
               
                  Q. VVHat particular reſpect hath euery of the Petitions to
Gods glory?
               
                  A. 1. The hallowing of Gods Name is the chiefeſt part of
his glory.Leu. 10. 3. 
                  I will be ſanctified, ſaith the Lord, in them that come
nigh to me, and before all the people I will bee glorified. By being
ſanctified, or hallowed, God is glorified. In faith therefore we may
thus pray, Hallowed be thy name, to him whoſe the gloryis.
               
               2. Gods Kingdome is the prime place of his glory.Pſal. 26. 8. It is the
place where his honour dwelleth. To the Church the peculiar Kingdome
of God it is ſaid,Iſa. 60. 1, 2. 
                  The glory of the Lord is riſen vpon thee:
his glory ſhall bee ſeene vpon thee. Confidently therefore to him
whoſe the glory is wee may make this ſute, Thy Kingdome
come.
               
               
                  
3. The creature cannot better glorifie God then by obeying
his will.Ioh. 15. 8. 
                  Herein ſaith Chriſt, is my Father glorified that yee beare
much fruit.
                  1. Sam. 15. 22. 
                  To obey is better then Sacrifice. Hee therefore that
prayeth, Thy will be done, to him, whoſe the glory 
                        •
                     s, may be ſ
                     •
                  re
to haue his prayer granted.
               4. The diuine prouidence in temporall bleſſings much amplifieth
Gods glory.Exod. 16. 7. By giuing bread to his people in the wilderneſſe
God ſhewed his glory.
                  Pſal. 145. 11, 15, &amp;c. Where the Prophet ſaith, They
ſhall ſpeake of thy glory, by way of explication, hee reckoneth vp
many euidences of Gods prouidence in temporall bleſſings,
thus, The eyes of all waite vpon thee: thou giueſt them their meate
in due ſeaſon, &amp;c. His glory therefore whoſe the glory is will
moue him to grant this Petition, Giue vs this day our daily
bread.
               
               5. The glory of God is exceedingly commended by pardoning
ſinne.Epheſ. 1. 6, 7. 
                  To the praiſe of the glory of his grace we haue forgiueneſſe
of ſinne. In much confidence therefore thou maiſt ſay Forgiue
vs our debts, to him whoſe the glory is.
               
               6. Preſeruation and deliuerance of Saints from euill much
magnifieth and ſetteth forth the glory of God. Where the
Prophet reckoneth vp many deliuerances which God gaue to
his people,Iſa. 59. 19. he inferreth thereupon, They ſhall feare the Name of
the Lord from the West:
                  Ezek. 39. 21. 
                  and his glory from the riſing of the Sun.
And on the ſame ground ſaith God himſelfe, I will ſet my glory
among the heathen. This Petition, Leade vs not into temptation
but deliuer vs from euill, may in faith be made to him whoſe the
glory is.
               
            
            
               §. 236. Of the ſpeciall relation which the ſeuerall
Petitions haue to Gods vnchangeable
eternitie.
               
                  Q. VVHat particular reſpect bane euery of the Petitions to
Gods immutable eternity?
               A. 1. Gods Name is for euer,Pſal. 135. 13. and his memoriall endureth
thorowout all generations.
               
                  
2. His Kingdome is an euerlaſting Kingdome.Pſal. 145. 13.
               
               3. Gods will is to be done thorow-out all Ages, by vs, by our
ſonnes,
                  Deut. 6. 2. 
                  by our ſonnes ſonnes. Wee may therefore well make theſe
Petitions. Hallowed be thy name, Thy Kingdome come, Thy will be
done, though they be of euerlaſting and immutable matters, to
the eternall God whoſe the Kingdome is, and the power, and the
glory FOR EVER.
               
               4. We euery day want bread, ſo ſhall we doe as long as we
liue.1 Chro. 29. 15. As our Fathers from the beginning of the world haue
ſtood in need thereof,Ioh. 4. 13. ſo doe we, and ſo ſhall our poſterity alſo.
For whoſoeuer drinketh of this water ſhall thirſt againe.
               
               5. Our Fathers of old to our time haue ſinned:Act. 7. 51. ſo doe wee
all our daies:Ezek. 9. 7. ſo will our poſterity for euer.
               6. The Diuel hath beene a murtherer from the beginning,
                  Deut 31. 
                        •
                     1. and
euer will be.Iob. 8. 44. There is perpetuall enimity betwixt the womans
ſeede, and his ſeede.Gen. 3. 15. We and ours ſhall be for euer in this world
ſubiect to many euills. We therefore who make theſe Petitions,
Giue vs this day our daily bread, And forgiu
                        •
                      vs our debts,
And leade vs not into temptation, but deliuer vs from euill, haue
neede to be well inſtructed in Gods eternity, and immutability.
For in faith we may make the forenamed Petitions concerning
our perpetuall needs to him whoſe Kingdome, and power,
and glory is FOR EVER.
               
               Hitherto of the acknowledgement of Gods properties as they haue
relation to the Petitions, and are reaſons to enforce them.
The ſaid acknowledgement is further to bee conſidered ſingly
and ſimply by it ſelfe.
            
            
               §. 237. Of the neceſſary vſe of this clauſe, Thine is
the Kingdome, and the power and
the glory for euer.
               
                  Q. WHat doth the acknowledgement of Gods properties
ſingly conſidered import?
               
                  A. A forme of praiſe.1 Chro. 29. 10. 11▪
                   For where mention is
made of Dauids bleſſing God, it is ſet downe in this forme,

                  Thine, O Lord, is the greatneſſe, and the power, and the glory, &amp;c.
Thus is this clauſe (Thine is the Kingdome and the power, and the
glory for euer) the ſecond part of the Lords Prayer: whereby the
perfection of that Prayer is ſet out.Phil. 4. 6. For prayer coſiſteth of theſe
two parts Petition &amp; Praiſe.
                  1. Theſ. 5. 17, 18. They therefore who wholy omit
this clauſe, and caſt it out of this patterne of Prayer make it an
imperfect patterne: as Papiſts who thoroughout their whole Liturgy
haue omitted it. Yea the vulgar Latin trāſlatiō hath left it
out of the text, in that place where it is expreſſed by S. Mathew:
and the Rhemiſts engliſh tranſlation doth ſo alſo.B

                        ••
                     , ſed inſerta fuiſſe à graecis. And the great
Champion of Papiſts, where purpoſely hee vndertaketh to expound
the Lords Prayer, cleane omitteth this clauſe▪ and auoucheth
that It is certaine that thoſe words are not of the euangelicall
Text, but were inſerted by the Greekes. But as diligent ſearchers
into all ſorts of greeke copies, as he, haue found it, not onely in
the expoſitions and commentaries of greeke Fathers, but alſo in
moſt of the greeke copies of the New Teſtament. And the ancient
Syriack tranſlator, who was none of the greeke expoſitors,
hath it. Yea many of the Latine Fathers alſo make mention
thereof, as of a part of the Lords Prayer, though ſome of
them ſometimes in their expoſitions haue omitted it.
               
                  Obiect. Saint Luke hath left out this clauſe. Luke 11. 1. &amp;c.
               
                  Anſw. The Hiſtory which Saint Luke recordeth as an occaſion
of ſetting downe the Lords Prayer, is not the ſame which
Saint Mathew recordeth, but another.
               The occaſion mentioned by Saint Mathew was this. The
hypocriticall Phariſees got to themſelues the name of deuout
perſons by their frequent, and much praying. But Chriſt obſeruing
their Deuotion to be but plaine ſuperſtition, diſcouereth
ſundry of their aberrations both in the manner and alſo in
the matter of their prayers, and to giue his Diſciples and others
a patterne, whereunto if they held cloſe, they might ſufficiently
be directed in the matter aud manner of prayer, he preſcribeth
that forme which is thereupon called the Lords Prayer. It was
therefore neceſſary that this patterne of Prayer ſhould be perfect,
without deficiency, or ſuperfluity.
               The occaſion mentioned by Saint Luke was this. Iohn the
Baptiſt had declared to his Diſciples what things eſpecially they

ſhould by prayer aske of God. Thereupon Chriſts Diſciples
entreate their Maſter to doe the like for them. On this occaſion
therefore it was ſufficient for Chriſt to note out ſuch principall
points as were moſt behoofull to be asked of God, though hee
did not preſcribe ſo perfect a forme as that which is recorded
in his Sermon on the Mount. Let it now bee well conſidered,
whether they that vſe the Lords Prayer as a perfect patterne,
haue ſufficient cauſe from Lukes not mentioning of this forme
of praiſe, cleane to omit it.
               Surely as Saint Mathew hath recoded this prayer, Chriſt vttered
it, and ſo is it to be vſed of vs, when it is vſed as a forme
or patterne of Prayer.
            
            
               
               §. 238.
Of adding Praiſe to
Petition.
               
                  Q. VVHat doth the adding of this laſt part of the Lords
Prayer to the former import?
               
                  A. Praiſe muſt be added to Petition. IfPſal. 50. 15. Phil. 4▪ 6. expreſſe precepts, approued
Dan. 6. 10. Col. 1▪ 3. practiſes, pretious1 Sam. 2. 30. Pſal. 50. 23. promiſes, graciousLuk. 17. 19. approbations,
plentifull2. Chr. 20. 22. remunerations, be motiues to ſtirre vs vp to performe
a dutie, motiues are not wanting to prouoke vs to praiſe
God: eſpecially to prouoke ſuch as haue the Spirit of ſupplication
beſtowed vpon them: and haue a ready minde, and forward
will to preſent Petitions vnto God according to their needs. For
               1. Praiſe is the end of Petitions. Wee call vpon God for
ſuch and ſuch bleſſings that we may praiſe and bleſſe God for
the ſame.1. Chro. 16. 35. Thus are we taught to pray, Saue vs O God of our ſaluation,
that we may giue thankes to thy holy Name, and glory in thy
praiſe.
               
               2. Praiſe maketh Petition powerfull. For God is moſt willing
and ready to grant their Petitions, whoſe heart hee knoweth
to be ready and willing to praiſe him. To giue praiſe for
former benefits is an effectuall meanes to obtaine further benefits.
The tradeſe-man that dealeth with a chap-man that is
carefull to pay for wares formerly receiued, will bee ready to
truſt him with more, according to his neede. On this direction,
Offer vnto God thanksgiuing,
                  Pſal. 50. 14, 15. this inuitation is made, Call vpon
mee in ihe day of trouble, and I will deliuer thee.
               
               3. Praiſe is a due debt which Petitioners are bound to pay.
He that inuiteth thee to call on him, and promiſeth to deliuer
thee, requireth and expecteth this recompence, thou ſhalt glorifie
me.
                  Pſal. 50. 15.
               
               4. Praiſe is all that we can returne vnto God for all his benefits
to vs.Pſal. 116. 12, 13, 17. Where this queſtion was made, What ſhall I render

to the Lord for all his benefits towards me, this anſwer was giuen,
I will take the cup of ſaluation: that is, I will offer a ſolemne Sacrifice,
wherein and whereby I will ſhew the deliuerances, and
preſeruations which God hath afforded to me. For by way of
expoſition hee addeth a little after, I will offer the Sacrifice of
Thanksgiuing.
               
               5. Praiſe is an euidence of that good reſpect wee beare to
God. By Petition we ſhew the reſpect which wee beare to our
ſelues.Luk 17. 13. &amp;c. The ten Lepers which came to Ieſus, and cried, Haue
mercy on vs, ſhewed a care of their owne welfare: onely one,
who returned to giue glory to God, ſhewed his care of Gods
honour.
               6. Praiſe moueth God to ſhew good reſpect to man. For
he that thus ſaid,1 Sam. 2. 30. 
                  Th
                        •
                     m that honour mee will I honour, will performe
what he hath ſaid.
               7. Praiſe is the greateſt honour that wee can giue to God.
For thus ſaith the Lord himſelfe,Pſal. 50 23. 
                  Who ſo offereth praiſe glorifieth
me.
               
               8. To praiſe God is the moſt heauenly exerciſe that in this
world can be performed. The celeſtiall ſpirits ſpend their time
therein, Reu. 5. 13. And 7. 11, 12. &amp;. 19. 1. &amp;c.
               9. A ſetting forth of Gods praiſe, is an eſpeciall meanes to
quicken the ſpirit, and to make the heart the more ready to
prayer, and the more cheerefull therein. When the Pſalmiſts
heart was ſet to Praiſe the Lord,
                  Pſal. 57. 8, 9. then he ſaith to his tongue, and
inſtruments, Awake vp my glory, awake Pſaltery and Harpe, I my
ſelfe will awake early. When the Spirit of a man is dull and heauy,
ſo as he cannot pray, let him meditate on Gods mercies
and other excellencies, and ſet himſelfe to praiſe God, and hee
ſhall finde a ſpirituall vigour thereby put into him.
               10. Ingratitude is one of the moſt odious vices that can be:
deteſtable to God and man.2 Tim. 3. 2. The Apoſtle reckoneth it vp among
thoſe notorious vices that ſhould be in the world in the
laſt and worſt times thereof.Iſa. 1. 2, 3. The Prophet herein maketh ſuch
as did beare the name of Gods people to bee more bruitiſh
then the bruteſt of beaſts, the Oxe and the Aſſe. Nothing
more prouoketh God to take away his bleſſing, as he threatned
Iſrael.
                  Hoſea 2. 8, 9. The things which God vſeth to beſtow vpon gratefull

perſons, hee vſeth to take away from the vngratefull. The
moſt memorable iudgements that are recorded in the Scriptures
were cauſed by vngratefulneſſe.Gen. 6. 2. &amp;c. When God had culled a
Church out of the world, who in that reſpect were called ſonnes
of God, they vnmindfull of Gods gracious calling, mixed themſelues
with daughters of men: which made God repent that he
had made man, and thereupon he brought vpon the world that
generall deluge, wherewith he ſwept away all but eight perſons.Compare Gen. 14. 16. &amp;c. with Gen. 18. 20, 21. &amp; Gen. 19. 24.
After that God by his ſeruant Abraham had reſcued Sodome
and the neighbouring Cities from the hand of their enemies,
they were not carefull to render praiſe to God, but continued
in their beaſtly abominations. They were therefore all
burnt with fire and brimſtone from heauen.2. Chr. 36▪ 16, 17. Iſraels vngratefulneſſe
was the cauſe of her captiuitie. This was it that prouoked
God to giue ouer the Gentiles to a reprobate ſence:Rom. 1. 21. &amp;c. and
to giue Chriſtians ouer to Antichriſtianiſme.2. Theſ. 2. 9, 10, 11. This cauſed that
Nebuchadnezzar was made as a beaſt; and that Herod was eaten
with wormes.Dan. 4. 30, 31. This I hope may be ſufficient to worke ſome
care and conſcience to performe this duty of praiſe.Acts 12. 23.
               
            
            
               §. 239. Of praiſing God. How it is done.
               
                  Q. VVHat is it to praiſe God?
               
                  A. 1. To acknowledge God to be what he
is. Thus doth Moſes in his Pſalme of thankſgiuing
praiſe God, ſaying, The Lord is a man of warre: Iehouah is
his name.
                  Exod. 15. 3.
               
               2. To attribute to God that which is his: as Chriſt doth in
this forme;1. Chr. 29▪ 10, 11. and Dauid, ſaying, Thine ô Lord, is the greatneſſe, and
the power, and the glory, &amp;c.
               
               3. To aſcribe to God that which is done by him. Thus doth
Exod. 15. 4. 
                  Moſes praiſe God, by aſcribing to him the ouerthrow of
Pharaoh and his hoaſt. So dothPſal. 107. 2, 3. &amp;c. the Pſalmiſt in moſt of his
Pſalmes of praiſe.—135. 1. &amp;c.
               
               4. To profeſſe that which God giueth to be giuen of him:—136. 1. &amp;c. as
Dauid in his forme of praiſe thus doth,1. Chro. 29. 14▪ &amp;c. 
                  All things come of thee,
and of thine owne haue we giuen thee.
               
               5. To declare to others all the forenamed points concerning

God.
                  1. Chro. 16. 8, 9. 
                  To this purpoſe ſaith Dauid, Giue thankes vnto the Lord,
make knowne his deeds among the people. Sing vnto him: ſing Pſalmes
vnto him: talke ye of all his wondrous workes. And againe, I will declare
thy name vnto my brethren: in the middeſt of the congregation
will I praiſe thee.
               6. To worſhip God in teſtimonie of all the ſaid points: as
is euident by this exhortation,1. Chro. 16. 29. 
                  Giue vnto the Lord the glorie due
to his Name: bring an offering, and come before him: worſhip the
Lord, &amp;c.
               
               By all theſe particular branches of praiſing God gathered
out of the Scriptures, it is moſt cleare, that by praiſing and glorifying
God, we giue nothing at all to God: but onely what he
is, what is 
                     •
                  is, what is done, or giuen by him, is acknowledged
and declared, and God with due reſpect reuerenced and adored.
Which as it directeth vs how to praiſe God, ſo it ſetteth
out Gods goodneſſe in accepting that which is his owne, as giuen
to him by vs: and alſo it diſcouereth the peruerſe diſpoſition
of vngratefull perſons, who do as much as in them lieth to
with-hold from God that which is his owne, and moſt due vnto him.
            
            
               §. 240. Of the things for which God is to
be praiſed.
               
                  Q. VVHich are the Principall grounds for which God is to be
praiſed?
               
                  A. 1. His Excellencie in himſelfe.
               2. His Soueraigntie aboue vs.
               3. His Mercie towards vs.
               All theſe ſhew that God is moſt worthy of all praiſe.
               1. Excellencie in any thing is praiſe worthy: as excellencie
of knowledge, excellencie of wiſedome, excellencie of power
and ſtrength, excellencie of any vertue, yea excellencie of eloquence,
excellencie of beautie and euerie other excellencie. It is
ſaid of the woman whoſe excellencies were many,Pro. 31. 30, 31. 
                  Shee ſhall be
praiſed: and Let her owne workes praiſe her: But§. 218. we haue ſhewed
that all excellencies are in God. Yea the excellencies which are
in creatures are Gods, becauſe they come all from God. If therfore

praiſe be due to any, much more to God. That very praiſe
which in any reſpect may lawfully be giuen to any creature, is
moſt properly due to him. Where Dauid bleſſeth A
                        •
                     igail for
her wiſe aduiſe, he firſt bleſſeth God that ſent her, ſaying,
Bleſſed be the Lord which ſent thee this day to meet me:
                  1. Sam. 25 32, 33. 
                  and bleſſed
be thy aduiſe,
                  Act. 12. 23. 
                  and bleſſed be thou, &amp;c. But becauſe Herod gaue not God
the glorie which was giuen to him he was eaten of wormes. Beſides
there are ſuch infinitely ſurpaſſing excellencies in God, as no
creature is capable of: as Selfe-exiſtencie, Etermitie, All-ſufficiency,
Immutabilitie, Omnipotencie, Vbiquitie, &amp;c. That praiſe therefore
is due to God,Exod. 15. 11. which may be aſcribed to no other. For who is
like vnto thee, ô Lord, amongſt the Gods? Who is like thee, glorious
in holineſſe,
                  1. Sam. 2. 2. 
                  fearefull in praiſes, &amp;c. There is none holy as the Lord:
for there is none beſide thee: neither is there any rocke like our God.
Great is the Lord,
                  1. Chron. 16. 25. 
                  and greatly to be praiſed. Thus we ſee how Gods
excellencie miniſtreth iuſt and great cauſe of praiſing God. If
when we are about to praiſe God, our hearts were deepely
fixed on a due meditation and ſerious conſideration of Gods
excellencies, they would bee much quickened vnto this heauenly
dutie of praiſing God.
               2. Soueraigntie maketh one to be much praiſed. Who more
praiſed then Kings? They are praiſed for the things praiſe-worthy
in their owne perſons, and praiſe-worthy in their ſubiects.
If in a kingdome there be learned Deuines, faithfull Miniſters,
iuſt Magiſtrates, wiſe Counſellers, valiant Souldiers,
victorious Captaines, skilfull Artificers, induſtrious Husbandmen,
obedient Subiects, the King is much praiſed for them all:
and it is ſuppoſed that his wiſe and good gouernment is the
cauſe of all. Beſides praiſe vſeth to be proportioned according
to the dignitie wherein men are. The higher a mans place is,
the more praiſe vſeth to be giuen to him. Kings therefore being
the higheſt in their Dominions, greateſt praiſe vſeth to bee
giuen to them. But God hath beene§▪ 207. prooued to be the moſt
ſupreme and abſolute Soueraigne ouer all, The King of Kings.
On this ground we are thus incited to praiſe God, Sing praiſes
to God,
                  Pſal. 47. 6, 7. 
                  ſing praiſes, ſing praiſes to our KING, ſing praiſes: for God is
the King of all the earth, &amp;c. This reaſon is giuen of the heauenly
Halelu-iah,
                  Reu. 19. 6. 
                  For the Lord God omnipotent reigneth. As God by his

Soueraigntie is the higheſt of all, ſo by vertue of his prudent
gouernment, all good things which are any way praiſe-worthy,
are indeed done. They that haue knowledge hereof, and
can in truth of heart acknowledge as much, will aſſuredly bee
ready on all occaſions to praiſe God.
               3. Kindneſſe, goodneſſe, and mercie are the things which do
moſt of all enflame the heart to giue praiſe. They are the moſt
principall obiect of praiſe, for which thankes vſeth to be giuen.
I will praiſe thy Name,
                  Pſal. 138. 2. ſaith the Pſalmiſt to God, for thy louing
kindneſſe.
                  Pſal. 117. 1, 2. And he exhorteth all nations to praiſe the Lord, on this
ground, His mercifull kindneſſe is great towards vs. After hee had
thus ſet out the goodneſſe of God,Pſal. 145. 8, 9, 10 
                  The Lord is gracious, and full
of compaſſion: ſlow to anger, and of great mercie: the Lord is good to
all, and his tender mercies are ouer all his workes, he maketh this inference,
All thy workes ſhall praiſe thee, ô Lord: and thy Saints ſhall
bleſſe thee. Gods mercies therefore, the maine matter of praiſe,
are to be called to mind, and to be ſet in order, when we go about
to praiſe God. Theſe are they, that are of greateſt power
to rouſe vp our dull ſpirits, to put a ſpirituall life into vs, and
to prouoke vs to praiſe the Lord. I haue diſtinctly laid downe
theſe in The whole Armour of God, Treat. 3. Part. 2. §. 63.
               Now in that the forenamed grounds of praiſe are onely in
God,Praiſe due onely to God. praiſe is due to him alone. For
               1.Pſal. 148. 13. His onely is true excellencie, as was before prooued.
§. 218.
               2.Dan. 4, 25. His Soueraigntie onely is abſolute. As before. §. 207.
208.
               3.Math. 19. 17. He onely is good. AndIam. 1. 17. euery good thing commeth
from him.
               Idolaters, who giue praiſe to falſe gods (asDan. 5 23. 
                  Belſhazzer did)
and flatterers, who vnduly praiſe men (asAct. 12. 22. 
                  Herods people did)
depriue God of that glorie which is due to him. Let ſuch duely
weigh the fearefull iſſue that befell both Belſhazzer and Herod.
               
               How farre praiſe may be giuen to men, is declared in The
whole Armour of God. Treat. 3. Part. 2. §. 61.
               Hitherto of the Subſtance of the Lords Prayer. The Circumſtance
following it remaineth to be handled.
            
            
               
               §. 241.
Of the meaning and vſe of AMEN
being prefixed before a Speech.
               
                  Q.
                  Meaning of AMEN. VVHat is the circumſtance following Prayer?
               
                  A.
                  Amen in his Petitionibus ſignificat, indubitanter à Domiao conferri quod petitur. Aug. de Temp. Ser. 58. The ratification of all. This is expreſſed
in this one word AMEN. That Amen
importeth a confirmation of that which is ſaid, is euident by
Benaiahs anſwere to Dauids direction concerning Salomons
crowning. For Benaiah deſiring from his heart that Dauids ſaid
direction might bee accompliſhed and ratified, hee anſwereth
thereto Amen:
                  1. King. 1. 36. and to explaine his minde and meaning more
fully,Amen. 1. firmum &amp; ſtatum eſto à Deo. Tremel. &amp; Iun. in ann
                        •
                     l. in hunc loc. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Fiat. he addeth, The Lord God of my Lord the King ſay ſo too:
that is, as other Tranſlators turne it, ratifie it. The Greeke
Tranſlators thus turne it, Be it done. The root from whence
the word commeth ſignifyeth as much, as is euident by this
phraſe in Salomons Prayer, O God of Iſrael, let thy word, I
pray thee,
                  1. King. 8. 26. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   be ratified, which thou ſpakeſt vnto Dauid.
               This Particle in Scripture is diuerſly vſed.
               Sometimes it is prefixed before that which is vttered:
and ſometimes it is inferred after it.
               It is prefixed before Speeches,The vſe of Amen being ſet before a ſpeech. to ſhew both the certaintie
and the neceſſiitie of that which is deliuered. When Chriſt inſtructed
Nicodemus in the myſterie of regeneration, to declare
vnto him the neceſſitie thereof, hee thus expreſſeth it, Amen,
Amen,
                  Ioh. 3. 3. 
                  I ſay to thee, except a man bee borne againe hee can not ſee
the Kingdome of God. And becauſe Nicodemus made queſtion
thereof in the ſame manner hee doth againe repeat it (ſaying,Ioh. 3 5.
                  Amen, Amen, I ſay to thee, Except a man bee borne of water and
of the Spirit, hee can not enter into the Kingdome of God) to
ſhew that it was a true, certaine, ſure, infallible point which
fell not from his mouth vnawares, but ſuch an one as hee durſt
ſtand to, yea and pawne his credit thereupon.
               
                  Q. What duties doth Amen import when it is prefixed before
a Speech?
               
                  
                  A. Two eſpecially. 1. Attention. 2. Beliefe.
               1. Where the holy Ghoſt by any note or ſigne ſetteth out the
Excellencie, Neceſſitie, Vtilitie or any other like commendation
of a point, hee requireth vs to giue more then ordinarie attention
thereunto.Math. 24. 1, 2. When the Diſciples ſhewed Chriſt the
glorious building of the Temple, that they might the better
marke what hee foretold of the deſtruction thereof,
thus hee expreſſeth it, AMEN I ſay vnto you, there ſhall
not bee left here one ſtone vpon another, that ſhall not be throwne
downe.
               
               2. Where the Holy Ghoſt knoweth vs to bee backward
and hard to beleeue ſuch Principles as be of an infallible veritie,
he vſeth aſſeuerations, &amp; obteſtations to draw vs on to giue
the more credence thereunto. Anſwerably therefore we muſt
mixe faith with our hearing of ſuch points. To this purpoſe
when Chriſt obſerued vnbeliefe,Mat. 7. 20. and doubting in his Diſciples,Mar. 11. 2
                        •
                     , 23.
hee vſed this his note of aſſeueration, Amen, to moue them the
more ſtedfaſtly to beleeue what he ſaid.
            
            
               §. 242. Of the vſe of AMEN being added
to a Speech.
               Q. HOw is AMEN added to a ſpeech?
               
                  A. 1. By him that vttereth a ſpeech.
               2. By him, or them that heare it.
               
                  Ro 16▪ 24, 27 It was vſuall with the Apoſtles when they made a prayer,1. Cor. 16. 24.
or gaue thankes,2. Cor. 13. 13. or pronounced a bleſſing,1. Pet 5. 14. themſelues to adde
thereunto Amen:
                  1. Ioh. 5. 21. And as vſuall it was with the people of God
that heard like ſpeeches vttered by others,Iude, verſe 25. to ſay Amen: whether
it were1. Kin. 1. 36. onely one, orNeh. 5. 13. many together.To what kindes of ſpeeches AMEN is added
               
               Many are the kindes and formes of ſpeeches whereunto
AMEN is in Scripture noted to be added, as
               1.Rom. 15. 33. Petitions.
               2.Neh. 8. 6. Benedictions and Praiſes.
               3.Neh. 5. 13. Imprecations and Curſes.
               4.1. Ioh. 5▪ 21. Exhortations to Duties.
               
                  
5.Reu. 22. 20. Declarations of Promiſes.
               6.Reu. 1. 7. Denunciations of Iudgements.What Amen importeth being added to a ſpeech.
               
               Three eſpeciall things doth AMEN import, when it is pronounced
after any of the fore-named ſpeeches.
               1. True aſſent.
                  1. Cor. 14, 16. This the Apoſtle implyeth, where hee
directeth the Church to pray, reade and preach in a knowne
tongue, for this end, that euen the vnlearned Hearer may ſay
Amen, that is, vnderſtanding what hee heareth giue aſſent
thereto.
               2. Earneſt deſire. When the Prophet Ieremiah heard the
propheſie of Hananiah concerning the returne of the King of
Iudah to his Kingdome, and the other Captiues to their land,
and of the veſſels that were taken away, to the Temple, though
hee knew that to bee a falſe propheſie, yet to ſhew how earneſtly
hee deſired that it might bee ſo,Ier. 28. 6. hee ſaith thereto,
AMEN: and fully to declare what hee meant thereby, hee addeth,
The Lord doe ſo: the Lord performe thy words, &amp;c.
               
               3. Stedfaſt faith.
                  Reu. 22. 20. Where Chriſt maketh a promiſe of his
ſecond comming, ſaying, Surely I come quickely: the Church,
to ſhew her ſtedfaſt faith in that promiſe, ſaith, AMEN, which
importeth thus much, Lord, I beleeue what thou haſt ſaid: Euen
ſo, come Lord Ieſus.
               
               Theſe being the proper ends of ſaying Amen,
                  By whom Amen may rightly be vſed. to manifeſt
Aſſent, Deſire and Faith, it is without contradiction true, that
whoſoeuer ſaith Amen, muſt vnderſtand that whereunto he ſaith
Amen. In this caſe two things are neceſſarily to bee vnderſtood.
               1.
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . The words that are vttered.
               2.
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . the meaning of thoſe words.
               If the words ſpoken bee not vnderſtood,1. Cor. 14. 9. they are as ſpoken
into the aire, altogether in vaine: and the ſpeaker and hearer
are as Barbarians one to another. No more benefit can bee
receiued by the words of a man not vnderſtood, then by the
indiſtinct voice of an vnreaſonable creature. But ſuppoſe the
words bee ſuch as in themſelues are intelligible, being Engliſh
words to an Engliſh man, yet if the ſence and meaning of
them bee not conceiued, they are to no better purpoſe then
words of a ſtrange and vnknowne language. Words haue

ſometimes a figuratiue ſence and meaning, which if it bee
not vnderſtood, the proper and true vſe and benefit of them
is loſt. If Chriſt had not made his Diſciples to vnderſtand the
ſence and meaning of this direction,Math. 1
                        •
                     . 6▪ &amp;c. 
                  Take heed and beware of
the leauen of the Phariſies and of the Sadduces, they had got no
good at all thereby. It is therefore neceſſarie that as the words
themſelues, ſo the proper ſence of them be well vnderſtood.
               
                  Ob. AMEN is an Hebrew word: that language is vnderſtood
of very few: why then is it vſed of all Nations, of all
people in all Nations, learned and vnlearned?
               
                  A.
                  Rom. 1. 15. The Apoſtles, though they ſpake,Why Amen is vſed of all ſorts. and wrote not in
Hebrew, but in Greeke, yet they vſed this Hebrew word: ſo
as we haue an expreſſe warrant for retaining this word in another
language.
               2. Continuall vſe hath made it familiar to all perſons, of
all languages, in all nations. So as it is euery where as a proper
vulgar, mother word. Thus theſe two Titles Ieſus Chriſt,
though the one be Hebrew, and the other Greeke, are made ſo
familiar, as in all languages they are retained.
               3. No other one word ſo fit for the purpoſe, can in any other
language be inuented, as Amen is. Not without reaſon therefore,
and iuſt cauſe is it, that it hath beene made a word of all
languages. It compriſeth vnder it whatſoeuer is expreſſed or
vnderſtood in and by the ſpeech whereunto it is added. Theſe
words,Deut▪ 27. 26. (Curſed be hee that confirmeth not all the words of this
Law to doe them) had a large extent: yet the AMEN, which
the people were to ſay thereto, extended it ſelfe as farre.
            
            
               
               §. 243. Of the duties which AMEN added
to a ſpeech implyeth.
               
                  Q. VVHat duties are implyed by the vſe of AMEN after a
ſpeech ended?
               
                  A. 1. Such as concerne the Speaker.
               2.Duties which Amen requireth of ſuch as vtter a prayer. Such as concerne the Hearer.
               3. Such as concerne both Speaker and Hearer.
               Three duties eſpecially are required of him that vttereth the
ſpeech whereunto Amen is added.
               1. To ſpeake intelligibly in a knowne tongue. This is a point
much preſſed, 1. Cor. 14. 2. &amp;c. See more hereof in The whole
Armour of God▪
                   on Epheſ. 6. 18. §. 87, 88.
               2. To ſprake audibly, ſo as they which are to ſay Amen, may
heare what is ſaid.Deut. 27. 14. The Leuites vnder the Law were expreſſely
enioyned to ſpeake to the people with a lowd voice. Accordingly
the Leuites that were the mouth of the people to God, and
prayed in their preſence,Neh. 9. 4. 
                  cryed with a loud voice vnto the Lord
their God. Be a prayer made as intelligibly as may be, if it bee
not heard of them that are preſent, they cannot with aſſent, deſire,
and faith ſay Amen.
               
               3. To ſpeake diſti
                        •
                     ctly: that is, ſo treatably as hearers may
obſerue euery Petition, and euery particular point for which
thankes is giuen. It is expreſſely noted of ſuch as inſtructed
the people of God that they did it distinctly:
                  Neh. 8. 8. whereby the hearers
better vnderſtood what was deliuered. If Prayer or
Thankſgiuing be vttered by a voluble, ſwift tongue, too faſt,
hearers cannot aduiſedly obſerue the ſeuerall branches thereof:
ſo as if they ſay AMEN, at the beſt, it cannot bee but
to ſome parts: it cannot bee to all the prayer, or praiſe that is
vttered.
               Three duties alſo are required of them who ſay Amen to a
ſpeech vttered by others.Duties which Amen requireth of ſuch as heare a prayer.
               
               1. To attend diligently to that which is vttered.Neh. 8. 5. The people
that ſaid Amen to Ezra his bleſſing, are ſaid to ſtand vp, while he
ſpake. That geſture implyeth a diligent attention. If our minds
be wandring, and not attentiue to that which is vttered, what

aſſent, what deſire, what faith can there be? And if there bee
none of theſe, to what end is Amen ſaid? Surely it is a plaine
mockage of God.
               2. To giue aſſent therto. If with the mouth Amen be vttered and
no aſſent giuen with the heart, heart and tongue are repugnant,
and no better cenſure can be giuen of ſuch an Amen, then that it
is the Amen of an hypocrite, which is odious and deteſtable
to God?1. Cor. 14. 16. The Apoſtle vnder this phraſe (How ſhal we ſay Amen?)
implyeth aſſent: for a man may vtter this word Amen to that
which he vnderſtandeth not: but with aſſent of minde &amp; heart
he cannot ſay Amen.
               
               3. To manifest that aſſent.
                  Deut. 27. 15. &amp;c. Amen to bee vttered aloud by the whole aſſembly. The phraſe of ſaying Amen, oft
vſed in Scripture doth import a manifeſtation of aſſent. For
that which is ſaid and vttered, is manifeſted. This manifeſtation
of aſſent on the hearers part, muſt bee, as the vttering of the
prayer on the Speakers part,See more here of in the whole Armour of God, on Epheſ. 6. 18. Treat. 3. Part. 2. § 83. 
                  audibly. Euery hearer in an aſſembly
muſt vtter Amen, as loud as the Miniſter vttereth the
prayer. In many places it is put off onely to the Clerke. But
herein all ſhould bee Clearkes. There is mention made of a
celeſtiall ſound, which was as it were the voice of a great multitude,
and as the voice of many waters,
                  Reu. 19. 6. 
                  and as the voice of mighty
thundering, ſaying, Hallelu-iah. If full aſſemblies in our Churches
did all of them andibly after a prayer ſay Amen, ſo audibly
as the ſound of euery ones voice there preſent might come at
leaſt to the Miniſters eares, it would be ſuch a ſound as is there
mentioned, as heauenly ſound: A ſound well beſeeming a
Church. No Echo like to the Echo which maketh the wals of a
Church to ring againe with Amen. Such a ſound would quicken
a Miniſters ſpirits, and put a kinde of heauenly life into the
people themſelues.
               The duties which are required both of ſpeaker and hearers
by vertue of Amen to be added,Duties which Amen requireth both of Speaker and Hearers. are theſe that follow.
               1. To know the ground of all that is vttered, that that which
is mentioned, whereunto Amen is to be added, is grounded on
Gods Word, and agreeable to his will. For this is the confidence
which we haue in him,
                  1. Ioh. 5. 14. 
                  that if wee aske any thing according to his
will, he heareth vs.
               
               2. To haue the minde fixed thereon. The minde of the

ſpeaker, as well as the Hearer may bee ro
                     ••
                  ng and wandring:
eſpecially when a ſet, preſcribed, vſuall forme of prayer is vttered:
or when a prayer is read. Now becauſe the vtterer of a
prayer muſt ſay Amen to his owne prayer, as well as the hearers,
he, as well as they, and they, as well as hee, euen all of
them muſt hold their minde ſteady thereon;Iſa. 29. 13. elſe will their heart
be remoued from God, while they draw neere to him with their
mouth: which is an abomination to him.
               3. To retaine, as well as they can, in memorie all that
is vttered. For Amen muſt bee applyed to the whole ſpeech,
and to euery part thereof. Matters well retained in memorie
make Amen to come from the heart, and to bee vttered with a
goodwill.Pſal. 42. 4. 
                  When I remember theſe things, I poure out my ſoule in
me, ſaith the Pſalmiſt. That which is forgotten, is as not heard,
or not vnderſtood, or not attended vnto.
               4. To be affected with the prayer. This will make men
double their Amen, as the Iewes did when Ezra bleſſed the
Lord.
                  Neh. 8▪ 6. 
                  All the people anſwered, Amen, Amen, with lifting vp
their hands. Did not their ſpeech and geſture both declare much
affection of heart? Without this inward affection Amen will be
but coldly vttered.
               5. To beleeue Gods gracious acceptation of the prayer.
It hath beene§. 241. before proued that Amen is a ratification of
all that which is vttered before it. But with what heart can
that which is not before beleeued, bee after ratified. Expreſſely
therefore ſaith Chriſt,Mar. 11. 24. 
                  What thing ſo euer ye deſire, when
yee pray, beleeue that yee receiue it, And his Apoſtle putteth
this in,Iam. 1. 6. as a neceſſarie prouiſo, to prayer, Let him aske in
faith.
               
            
            
               
               §. 244. Of the grounds of Faith, whereby we may expect
the obtaining of what we pray for.
               
                  Q. HOw may we beleeue the obtaining of thoſe things which we
pray for?
               
                  A. By praying for ſuch things as we know to be
promiſed. Gods promiſes are the true and proper ground of a
ſound faith. Whatſoeuer is ſuppoſed to bee beleeued without a
promiſe, is but ſuppoſed, or rather preſumed: it is not rightly
and truly beleeued.Pſal. 119. 49. The Pſalmiſt hauing deſired God to remember
his promiſe made vnto him, thus ſaith, Vpon it thou haſt
cauſed me to hope, or to truſt. The ground then of his confidence
was Gods promiſe.Of abſolute and conditionall promiſes, and of the vſe of faith in them, See the whole Armour of God, on Eph. 6. 16. Treat. 2. Part▪ 6. §. 75. 76. 77. Of Faith. Now becauſe Gods promiſes are of diuers
kinds (ſome things being abſolutly promiſed, others but conditionally)
as Gods promiſes be made, ſo muſt our faith be ordered.
Abſolute promiſes muſt be beleeued abſolutly: conditionall
promiſes, with ſubmiſſion to Gods wiſedome in
granting, or not granting what we pray for. S. Paul hauing
prayed for the Philippians, and knowing that he prayed for
ſuch things as God had abſolutely promiſed, thus manifeſteth
his ſtedfaſt faith,Phil. 1. 6. 
                  I am confident of this very thing that he which hath
begun a good worke in you,
                  Rom. 1. 10. 
                  will performe it vntill the day of Ieſus
Chriſt.
                  —15. 32. But when he deſired to come to the Romans, he referred
that matter to the will of God, to be ordered therein, as it
ſhould ſeeme good to God.2. Sam. 15. 25, 26 So did Dauid in his deſire of returning
to his kingdome, and to the Tabernacle and Arke of
God, when by the treaſon of Abſolom he was forced from all.
               Concerning the Petitions of the Lords Prayer they are moſt
of them abſolutely promiſed: euen all of them but the fourth.
               1. For hallowing Gods Name, God himſelfe hath ſaid, I
haue both glorified my Name, and will glorifie it.
                  Ioh. 12. 28.
               
               2. For the comming of his kingdome, Chriſt hath ſaid, The
gates of hell ſhall not preuaile againſt my Church.
                  Mat. 16. 18.
               
               3. For doing his will, this is a branch of the new Couenant
which by Chriſts death is made abſolute,Ier. 31. 33. 
                  I will put my Law in
their inward parts, and write it in their hearts.
                  Ez
                        •
                     k. 36. 27. And againe, I will
put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walke in my Statutes, and you

ſhall keepe my iudgements and do them.
               
               5. For pardoning ſinne, this is another branch of the foreſaid
new Couenant,Ier. 31. 34. 
                  I will forgiue their iniquitie, and I will remember
their ſinne no more.
               
               6. For not leading into temptation, but deliuering from euill,
the Apoſtle ſaith,1. Cor. 10. 13. 
                  God will not ſuffer you to be tempted aboue that
you are able: but will with the temptation make a way to eſcape.
               
               4. For daily bread,Phil. 4. 12. God can inſtruct vs, both to be full, and to
be hungry, both to abound and to ſuffer need. Yea he can ſo giue, and
ſo take away, as to miniſter thereby to his Saints matter of bleſſing
him,Iob 1. 21. as Iob did.
               Well therefore may we ſay Amen to all the Petitions of the
Lords Prayer: to thoſe fiue, which are of bleſſings abſolutely
promiſed, with an aſſured faith of obtaining the very things
which are prayed for. To that wich is not ſo abſolutely promiſed
(which is the fourth) with ſuch a ſubmiſſion of our ſelues
wholy to Gods good pleaſure, as to beleeue that God will do
that which he in his wiſedome ſeeth to be beſt for vs. That he
will giue ſuch temporall bleſſings as he knoweth to be good for
vs: or giue vs ſuch grace as ſhall enable vs to beare the want of
ſuch things as he denieth vs. What God denieth to the Prayers
of his Saints, he knoweth that it is good for them to be without
it. He therefore that is well inſtructed in Gods wiſedome, and
aſſured of his loue, will without queſtion thinke it much better
to haue that which God knoweth to be hurtfull, or vnmeet for
him, to be denied, rather then granted vnto him.
               If that which we pray for, bee not at the firſt granted, wee
ought to perſiſt, and hold on in praying for it, asGen. 32. 26. 
                  Iaakob, who
ſaid to the Angell of the Couenant the Lord Ieſus Chriſt (Hoſ. 12. 4. Of perſeuering in Prayer, See the whole Armour of God, on Eph. 6. 18. Treat. 3. § 141. &amp;c. with
whom by Prayer he wreſtled) I will not let thee go, except thou
bleſſe me. And in this perſeuerance in Prayer we muſt alſo waite,
and with patience expect a gratious anſwer of our humble and
faithfull ſupplications ordered according to the will of God.
This is the expreſſe charge of the Prophet,Hab. 2. 3. 
                  Though it tarrie,
waite for it. This is the propertie of true faith. ForIſa. 28. 16. Of waiting, See The whole Armour of God, on Eph. 6. 17. Treat 1. Part. 7. §. 9. 
                        〈◊〉
                     . Hope. 
                  He that beleeueth
will not make haſte.
               
            
            
               
               §. 245. Of ſetting AMEN in the laſt place.
               Q. VVHy is AMEN ſet in the laſt place?
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Cyri
                        •
                     . Catech myſt. 5.
               
               
                  A. 1. To ſhew the extent of it.
               2. To ſhew the vſe of it.
               For the extent of AMEN, It muſt be applyed to the whole
Prayer that goeth before it, and to euery part and particle
thereof. Therefore in reciting the particular curſes of the Law,
Deut. 27. 15. &amp;c. AMEN was expreſly added to euery particular curſe. Though
ſo expreſly by an audible voice it be not alwaies added to euery
clauſe of euery Prayer, yet the mind giuing aſſent, and the heart
inclining a deſire, and mind and heart yealding faith to the
whole and to euery part, Amen, after all is vttered is a teſtification
of as much. Thus then by ſaying AMEN when all the
Lords Prayer is ended, we ſhew that our aſſent, deſire and faith
is extended to praiſe, as well as to Petition: and, among Petitions,
to ſuch as tend to Gods glorie, as our owne good: and,
of them which tend to his glorie, to that which maketh to the
proſperous encreaſe of his Church, as well as to that whereby
his Name is hallowed: yea and to that which tendeth to the doing
of his will, and that in the manner of doing it, as it is done
in heauen, as well as in the matter thereof: and among the Petitions
that tend to our good, as well to them which concerne
our ſpirituall well-fare as to that which concerneth our temporall
well-fare: and of thoſe which promote our ſpirituall well-fare,
as well to that whereby our ſanctification is craued, as to
that whereby we deſire to be iuſtified: and in that of our iuſtification,
of our profeſſion of forgiuing our debters, as well as to
our ſupplication for Gods diſcharge of our debts to him: and in
that of our ſanctification, both to preſeruation from Satans aſſaults,
and alſo to recouer out of his ſnares, and full deliuerie
from all euill: yea in euery Petition to others good, as well as to
our owne. Were Amen placed in any other place then in the
very end of a prayer, euen after all is finiſhed, it could not haue
ſo large an extent.
               2. For the vſe of AMEN, It is a recapitulation, or collection
into a briefe ſumme, of all that hath gone before, ſo as it being

vttered when the prayer is finiſhed, it ſheweth that when all
particulars haue been in ſpeciall mentioned, we muſt as in a
generall view caſt our mind vpon them all againe, and reuiew
our deſire of them: As Salomon did more amply and expreſly.
For after he had finiſhed his long, pithy, powerfull prayer which
he made at the dedication of the Temple, with a new and freſh

                  Let theſe my words wherewith I haue made ſupplication
before the Lord be nigh vnto the Lord our God day and night, that he
maintaine the cauſe of his ſeruant, and the cauſe of his people Iſrael, at
all times,
                  Prayer muſt not be abruptly broken of

before the Lords Prayer, teacheth vs not raſhly but aduiſedly,
with due preparation to come into Gods preſence and to
pray to him, ſo AMEN, being added after the Prayer, teacheth
vs, not abruptly but circumſpectly, with due conſideration of
all that hath bene prayed, to depart out of Gods preſence, and
to breake off Prayer. Whenſoeuer we preſent any Prayer to the
the diuine Maieſtie let vs ſo do. AMEN.
