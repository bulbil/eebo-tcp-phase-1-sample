            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            TO THE IVDICIOVS and ingenuous Reader.
            
               HOw backward I haue euer heretofore bin (best knowing mine owne weaknes) to publish ought by the Presse, they best know, who hauing oft pressed me thereunto, haue neuer hitherto therein preuailed. Now a twofold necessitie is imposed vpon me of doing somewhat in this kind, partly by the importunity of diuers Christian frends, religious and judicious, who hauing either heard, being partakers of my publike Ministery, or heard of by report of others, or vpon request seene some part of this weake worke, haue not ceased to sollicite the further publishing of it: As also partly, (and more specially) by the iniquitie of some others, who being of contrary iudgment in some particulars therein disputed, haue bin more forward than was fit by vn-christian slanders and vncharitable censures to taxe and traduce both me and it. From whose vniust and vndeserued aspersions no way seemed better and readier to cleare either, than by offring to open view of all, what I had before deliuered in an obscure auditorie (to speake of) among but a few. And this thou hast here (good Reader) for effect and substance the same that was then and there deliuered,

inlarged onely with such matter of History and Humanitie as was not so fit to pester the Pulpit or incomber that Auditorie withall. For the occasion of entring first into this discourse, and motiues of wading so far in it, I referre thee to 
                  Chap 9. §. 10. that part of it where I render an account thereof, vnwilling to stay thee longer, than needs must be, in the entry. If any shall surmise that writings in this kind may occasion too much liberty, a thing that litle needeth in this ouer-licentious age: I answer breifely; first that

                     r. &amp; Nider in consolat. timoraonscieuc. part. 3. c. 20. ad Cap. 9 § 10. it is vnequall that for the loosenes of some dissolute, the consciences of those that be godly disposed should be entangled and ensnared: and secondly, that whosoeuer shall take no more liberty than by me is here giuen, shall be sure Read the whole 9, Chapter. to keepe within the bounds of Piety, of Sobriety, of Equity, and of Charity: than which, I know not what can be more required. For no sinister end (I protest before Gods face and in his feare) vndertooke I this taske; neither haue I auerred or defended ought therein, but what I am verily perswaded to be agreeable to Gods word. If any man can better informe me in ought, I shall be right ready to hearken vnto him: neither haue I neglected any meanes in this kind, (by writing &amp; conference with others, besides mine owne priuate labors) that might further me therein. Defects in it (I know) there can not but be many: what, or whose worke is free from them? mine of many, much more: too many my selfe see; and many more (I well wot) a curious eye may soon espie. Let them in frendly and louing manner be shewed me by any; (as forme haue already bin by

by some; whom I rest beholden to for it) and I shall count it a speciall kindnes. Where defects shall appeare, let it yet be considered, whether they be vitall and fundamentall or no, such as touch the very heart and life of the maine matter, or such as notwithstanding them the frame (or foundation at least) may stand firme: And withall let it be remembred that I deale in an Argument that hath hitherto bin handled very confusedly by the most, and not very soundly by the best; as to any indifferent eye vpon due view of this present discourse may very euidently appeare. Of thee (whosoeuer thou art) I desire but to finde an vnpartiall Reader, a judicious discusser, and a charitable censurer; that

                what I profer with the right hand be not taken with the leaft, but that Charity may continue with diuersitie of iudgment, if thou shalt in ought remaine yet vnsatisfied; a course too too much wanting in this vncharitable age. And this fauourable acceptance if these my sory first-fruits shall finde, it may encourage a weake beginner to attempt somewhat further hereafter, that may be of better vse. Them and thee I commend both to him, who is the Author of all Truth, the clearing whereof hath bin in this worke my maine ayme: He vouchsafe a blessing; and through his blessing the labor (I hope) shall proue not vnfruitfull.

                   vse of Lots and Lotery, as it is very ancient, so hath bin in all ages no less frequent among men of all sorts. And considering that those things that are most in vse, are by meanes of mans corruption most subiect to abuse;

                   it ought not to seeme strange, if the like hath among the rest befallen Lots; if hauing bene so much in vse, they haue not bene free from much abuse; if hauing bene vsed by so many, they haue bin abused by the most. For 1 Tim. 4.4. cum. Tit. 1.15. Agg. 2.14, 15. Esai. 1.11.17. what Creature of God, or what Ordinance, be it ciuill or sacred, though good and holy in it selfe, is so happy, but that it receiueth, if not a deepe tincture, yet at least some slight fully, from the foule hands or defiled fingers of the most that deale with it. That the lawfull vse therefore of this Ordinance may be wisely discerned and warily seuered from

the abuse of it (

Which that it may be the better and the more orderly performed, it will not be amisse that we endeuor to consider and conceiue aright, in the first place what the nature of a Lot is in generall; and next to that, what the seuerall sorts thereof are; whereby the warrantable and vnwarrantable vse of them may the more plainely appeare.
               § 2. A Lot therefore may be well thus either defined or described, that it is a casualty or casuall euent purposely applied to the deciding of some doubt.
               In which definition or description so conceiued, (as in all other) are two things principally to be considered, the genus, as they terme it, that containeth the matter; and the forme or specificall difference of the thing defined.
               The Genus, or the matter of a Lot is said to be a casualty, or some casuall euent, because that how soeuer in some kind of Lot some guesse may be giuen, yet the euent is mainly casuall, and it is the casualty of it, that is principally respected and necessarily required in it vnto the constitution of a Lot. Those therefore reach a litle too farre that define a

Lot to be the doing of any thing whatsoeuer by the euent whereof some hidden thing may be discouered. For many things are and may be done for the discouery of hidden and vnknowne truths, which yet come not within the nature and compasse of a Lot. For example; A man suspecting his seruant to be light-fingred, layeth money as a bait in his way to tempt him withall, and thereby to try his honestie which he hath in some iealousie, which yet is no kind of Lot: to omit many other courses vsed ordinarily by those that are in place of authoritie and judicature for the finding out of malefactors and the discouery of crimes, in which yet there is no kind of Lotery, no more then of casualty. Whereas the matter of a Lot is euer some euent meerely casuall; as if a man to try whether his seruant be a theefe or no, shall put a scroll with his name in it, togither with others rolled vp seuerally into water, to see which will vnfold first, and thereby to determine and iudge of the party suspected whether he be guilty or guiltlesse of that crime. To which purpose tend those sayings of good Authors, that

                  Chance and casualtie striketh the

cheife stroke in them; if wee respect secondary causes.
               It was no Lot therefore, but a meere mockery of a Lot, that 
                     Vise Cicer: in Verr: 4.

                   he caused the tickets or tokens that were cast into the Lot-pot to be signed all of them with one and the selfe same mans name: It was, I say, no Lotery, because there could be no casualty or vncertainty in the drawing of the tickets so signed. But of Chance or casualty we will speake more at large in the next Chapter.
               § 3. The forme or specificall difference of a Lot is taken from the vse and intent or purpose of the vser, or that whereunto this casualtie or casuall euent is applied; which is said to be the deciding or determining of some doubt, whether it be the defining of some act to be done hanging yet in suspence, or the discouery of some hidden and vnknowne truth in things done or suspected to be done already. And this is that which distinguisheth a Lot from all other casuall euents and accidents, and that maketh the casuall euent so vsed to be a Lot so iustly accounted and called. Euery Lot therefore is casuall; and there can be no Lotery, where there is not casualty. But euery casuall euent is not consequently a Lot: For many things fall out casually, and do befall men so continually in the whole course of their liues, which yet come not the most of them within compasse of a Lot: as, meeting of those by the way that they neuer minded or once dreamed of; lighting on some one in the street or at the market, whom they desired to speake with, while they are going

about other businesse; the finding of some one thing while they looke after an other, or while they looke after nothing but go on in their way: These things and the like are casuall, but no lots; there is no lotery at all in them; because these things may befall a man will he, nil he, and do many times whether he regard them or no, whereas a Lot dependeth vpon the will and purpose of the vser, who by applying the thing zsed to such ends and purposes, maketh a Lot of that which otherwise in it owne nature were none. But for a man to apply such a casuall thing or the casuall occurrence of any such thing to the discouering, defining, deciding, determining or directing of any truth vnknowne, euent vncertaine, or course vnresolued, is to vse it as a Lot, and to make a Lot of it; this being that that giueth the very essence of a Lot to it. To this agreeth that definition of a Lot and Lotery giuen by some others, who define

                  A Lot to be a casuall euent determining our purposes: (though that be somewhat too scant, and comprehend but one kind;) and,

                  Lotery (whereof more anon) to be the determining of some doubt or vncertainty by the variable euent or disposition of some sensible thing that we propound to our selues. Which latter definition, though it do not so exactly point out the precise matter of a Lot, as we shall afterward shew, yet doth fully comprehend the proper vse of a Lot, and that which iustly maketh the casuall euent to be so termed and esteemed.
               § 4. Out of that therefore which hath bene said of the nature of a Lot may be raised, as I take it, somewhat a better definition, or at least description

of Lotery, to wit, that it is the deciding or determining of a doubt by some casuall euent. For that Lotery is not but where some question or controuersie is of some sort or other, a doubt of somewhat whither done or not done, or by whom, or in what manner done, or some deliberation concerning somewhat to be done or not done, or to be done either in this or that sort, which is by the Lot to be decided and determined, is a matter out of question, not denied of any, but agreed vpon by all. Now whereas many and sundry, yea infinite in a manner are the meanes wherby questions and controuersies are determined, of all these it is In a Lot there must be 2 things: 1 a casuall act: &amp; 2 the applying of that act to the determination of some controuersie. Perkins Cases of Consc: l. 3. s. 4. q. 2. resp. 2. some casualtie or casuall euent onely that is made choise of for the determining of the doubt in that which we properly terme Lotery.

               § 5. Where let me adde yet one thing further, that it is not only necessary in the matter of Lotery, that the thing be casuall that is applied to the deciding of a doubt, but that it be thereto applied so far forth as it is casuall, (I speake in regard of the creature both vsing and vsed) not as it hath either in it

owne nature, or in the conceit or counsell of those that make such vse of it, any speciall relation otherwise to the businesse thereby to be decided. An instance or two will helpe to cleare my meaning herein. For a man therefore requested to ride abroad on a rainy day with his frend, to say, I will ride, if it hold vp by noone, if it doe not, I will not stirre abroad: or for a man being crossed casually by an Hare on his way, to conjecture thereby of the euent of his iourney, and to determine thereupon of proceeding or stay, or of this or that successe in the same; there is in either of these cases a doubt decided by a casualtie, but that not considered as a casualtie, but as hauing otherwise a peculiar relation to the businesse intended, and the conueniency or inconueniency of it effected by it in the one and presaged by it in the other, and therefore making no Lotery: In which point also some of the former Authors seeme to faile, when they bring in

But for a man pressed in that manner to accompanie his frend, to say, we will draw cuts whether we shall stay or go, or whether I shall goe with you or you stay with me, and put off your iourney to some other time: or being vpon the way togither, and disagreeing in opinion concerning the shaping of their course, to referre the question and controuersie betweene them to be decided by the flight of the next Fowle, or the footing of some Beast that hath gone before them on the way: here is matter of casualty regarded as it is meerely casuall, and in that respect applied to decide

the present doubt, which no man therefore, I suppose, will deny to be Lotery indeed. And thus we see what both a Lot and Lotery is in generall, to wit, A Lot some casualty or euent meerely casuall purposely applied to the deciding of some doubt: and Lotery the deciding or determining of some question or controuersie by such casuall euents considered as they are such.

out of the same box or hand, sundry balls or bowles out of the same lap or arme. The other is an act of the Creator, a prouidence or assistance either in generall or speciall; and that for the most part generall and mediate in ordinary casualties, sometime speciall and immediate in extraordinary euents.

               § 4. From that which hath bene said, and already laid as a ground, may certaine conclusions be deduced concerning casuall Euents.
               The first conclusion: It is idle in matter of Casualty,

and so of Lotery, to confound the act of the Creator with the worke of the creature; they being two seuerall things distinct in themselues, which ought not therefore to be confounded in casuall euents more than in any other whatsoeuer. Yet thus many seeme to do, and those men of some note, when they say, that

                  Fortune is no other than but God nicnamed. But if we consider the terme of Nature, and so of Fortune or Chance, as the Holy Ghost vseth them; as Nature is a power or facultie in the creature distinct from Gods prouidence guiding and ruling, yea and oft ouer-ruling the same to such ends as he seeth good: so is Fortune or Chance also an affection or action of the creature distinct from the same prouidence whereby God likewise guideth and disposeth the same at his pleasure. As in naturall effects therefore there is the worke of the creature, which might be albeit there were no prouidence disposing it, but the creature for matter of direction were left wholy to it selfe: so is there the like also in casuall euents; which as they do now fall out, and yet are ordered, as all other things, by Gods prouidence either generall or speciall; so would no doubt fall out the same oft-times that now they do, were there no prouidence at all, but the creature left to it owne worke and will. In regard whereof the Scholeman not vnfitly saith, that

                   in the same, the decision of the matter in question is referred wholy, as we shall see after, to the casuall motion of the creature, without any speciall prouidence of the Creator required therevnto. In a word, if in casuall euents we consider ought beside the

by some naturall cause or other:) there is nothing guiding them but Gods prouidence: which two things, the act of the creature, and Gods prouidence accompanying it, though neuer sundred or seuered, yet are to be distinguished and distinctly considered, and not to be confounded the one with the other.
               § 5. A second conclusion: The casualtie of an euent doth not simply of it selfe make it a worke of Gods speciall or immediate prouidence. It is apparant: for there is oft-times a more speciall prouidence in many things that are not casuall but contingent only, then in the most things that are casuall. How many casuall euents daily befall vs, euen as many almost as we meete with men, or tread steps on our way, when euery cast of our eye ministreth new variety of casualtie, and euery vnexpected obiect bringeth a casuall euent with it; which yet no man will be so senselesse as to account so many seuerall works of speciall or immediate prouidence? And yet some one contingent euent onely among many other meerely casuall may be so, when they are not. For example; for a man on his way to be crossed oft by an Hare, to meete with many vnknowne, finde a peece of old yron, spie a couey of Partridges, haue his hat blowne of his head, and the like, may well befall a man and be all meerely casuall. But for a mans frend out of suspition of danger and fore-cast of distresse that his frend may incurre, to inforce his com
                     •
                  any vpon him, whereas otherwise he should trauaile alone and is desirous so to doe, and being in company with him to be a

meanes of sauing his life by recouery vpon a fall, or by rescue vpon assault, were an euent contingent rather than casuall. And yet who would not acknowledge a more speciall prouidence of God in the latter that is lesse casuall, or rather not casuall at all but contingent onely, deliberatory and voluntary, vndertaken vpon mature counsell and forecast, than in the former, that are or may be meerely casuall, and fall out beyond all expectation, without any forcecast at all?
               It is true indeed that Gods prouidence is more manifested in things casually befalling vs for good or euill, than in things that befall vs contingently by meanes of men and their forecast and affection to vs, or their hatred and malice; as more in things that fall out contingently, than in things that are necessarie. Howbeit the prouidence of God ordinarily extendeth it selfe to all of them alike, and is more speciall sometime in some things not casuall than in others that are such. Yea in the same euent either casuall or other may a more speciall prouidence of God be iustly deemed to be at some time than at other in regard of circumstances concurring: as for a man trauelling ouer Salisbury plaine to finde a pitcher of water left occasionally there, hauing no neede of it or vse for it, no man, I suppose, would expound as a speciall prouidence of God: But for a man exceedingly vexed with thirst, extremely distressed, as

                     Genes. 21.19. 
                  Hagar was directed by Gods Angell to a Well, he would haue iust cause to esteeme it to

haue a special prouidence of God in it, and might well terme the place where he should so finde it, as shee did an other place where Gods Angell found her,

No man not fondly superstitious would account so of the one; and no man not grossely impious but would iudge so of the other: yet both equally casuall: the casualtie of euents therefore doth not of it selfe simply adjudge them to either.
               § 6. A third conclusion: That may be casuall to one that is not casuall to another; where there is forecast and fore-knowledge and counsell foreseeing or directing and disposing it in the one, and not in the other: and that may seeme such, which indeed is not. For the better conceiuing hereof we are to consider that in casuall euents two things do concurre,

                  Chance is nothing but that, the cause whereof, or meanes whereby it is effected, is hid from vs. For many things we know not the cause of, which yet we ascribe not to chance, neither indeed are they casuall; but some of them are necessarie, as that the Load-stone should attract yron and steele, and direct the needle touched with it Northward, &amp;c. no knowne cause or certaine reason can be rendred of either; and yet are they necessary

and naturall, not casuall euents: some onely contingent, as the returne of Ague fits in an ordinarie course is not casuall, to speake properly, but contingent on

                  ly at the most, euen to such a one as out of ignorance of the true cause and ground of its recourse in that manner, suspecteth it to be some kind of spirit.

Thus then may the same thing be casuall to one, that is not so to another; because it was foreseene and fore-knowne by the one and not by the other: as 1 Sam. 10.2, 3▪

God therefore foreseeing all things ere any of them are, there can none of them fall out casually in regard of his Maiesty. But needs must he foresee all things euen ere they are, when there is nothing that he doth not euer see: and

               CHAP. III. Of the seuerall Sorts of Lots.
               § 1.THus much then shall suffice to haue spoken of the definition of a Lot, and of Casuall Euents, whereof a Lot is one, in generall: we will now proceed to consider of the seuerall Sorts and Kinds of it.
               In the diuision of Lots therefore I finde much diuersitie among Writers, some referring all to two heads, some to three, some to foure, some to more, vncertaine how many.

                  Lyra maketh but two sorts of Lots, diuisorie, vsed for the diuiding of something betweene diuers; and consultorie, for the determining of somewhat to be done. The former, saith he, lawfull and free from offence, if without greedy desire of gaine the euent be committed to the chance or the casuall motion of the creature: the latter vnlawfull, if the euent of it be expected from any created power beside the casuall act of the creature, as from the motion of Planets, or the operation of euill Spirits; not vnlawfull if it be expected from God or good Angels, so it be done in case of necessitie, with due reuerence, and out of Ecclesiasticall Elections.

                  Schlinder make two sorts, but in different termes, diuisorie and diuinatorie: diuisorie, vsed (as before) for diuision of possessions, legacies, spoiles, offices, exercises, imployments, and the like, and these lawfull and commendable: diuinatorie, vsed for the finding out of hidden and vnknowne truths, and the foretelling of future euents, and these vnlawfull and damnable. The consultorie Lot they thinke to be included in the two former, though not the same simply with either.

                  Serarius againe maketh two sorts another way, consultorie, and diuinatorie: For that, saith he, that by a Lot is sought out, is either the bare knowledge of things past, present or future; or beside the knowledge of something any action whatsoeuer that may come within compasse of deliberation and counsell; that is done by a diuinatorie, this by a consultorie Lot: the diuisorie Lot may be referred, he thinketh, to this latter.

                  Thomas Aquinas maketh three sorts, diuisorie, consultorie, and diuinatorie: diuisorie, determining what each one shall haue; consultorie, inquiring what were best to be done; and diuinatorie, searching what shall hereafter ensue. In these, saith he, the euent is expected, either from the starres, and that false and vaine; or from chance alone, as in the diuisorie, and that not wholy free from some vanity; or from some spirituall cause directing it, and that either the Deuill, and that wicked, or God, and that of it selfe not euill; yet such as may become sinfull, if Lots be vsed, vpon no necessitie, without due reuerence, with abuse of diuine oracles, or in Ecclesiasticall offices: otherwise in case of necessitie it being lawfull with due reuerence to

implore by Lot a diuine sentence. In his steps tread most of your

                  Peter Martyr, as he setteth downe the same sorts, so he passeth in a manner the same censure vpon them: that to expect the euent of them from Chaunce or Fortune is friuolous, from euill spirits superstitious, from planets ridiculous, from God alone religious, and onely lawfull, so that vsed in case of necessitie, reuerently and religiously, without superstition, without fraud or collusion, and without abuse of diuine oracles.

of bargaines &amp;c, to end strife; sporting, vsed commonly for the setting vp of banckrupts; diuining, vsed for the foretelling of future euents: The first warrantable vsed in cases of weight and necessitie, with invocation of Gods name; the two latter notable abuses, hauing no warrant in Gods word.

               Lots therefore may be all well referred to two heads, and sorted into two ranks, either of Ordinarie, of which kind those are which they commonly terme Diuisorie; or of Extraordinary, such as the

Consultorie and Diuinatorie are: the Ordinarie may be subdiuided into Serious and Lusorious; and these againe distinguished by sundry differences as occasion shall require.

TO begin then with the former sort: Ordinarie Lots I call those whose full worke may be effected by the ordinary or naturall power of the creature vsing them and vsed in them: or wherein no extraordinary power or prouidence is required for the direction of the action to that end wherevnto it is applied.
               Of this kind are all those Lots that are meerely Diuisorie, wherein the matter in question and controuersie is euer such as may well be decided by the casuall motion or euent of the creature, being committed therevnto by those in whose power it is to dispose of it, without any speciall prouidence or extraordinary meanes required for the directing of the action in this or that manner: which kind of Lots may be termed also Ciuill or profane Lots, taking the word profane, as it is opposed to Sacred, in the better sense.

                  Lot to be a kind of consulting with God of rare vse, yet lawfull to be vsed in such accidents, where neither reason

nor humane aduice can conveniently be had. For there is nothing lesse than any consulting with God in such Lots as we now speake of, there being no cause, nor reason, nor ground, nor occasion so to do: seeing there is neither any question concerning Gods will, what he would haue done or not done, nor any thing to be done that in regard of the difficultie of doing it, requireth any speciall aide and assistance or diuine presence or prouidence, more than any other ordinarie act and affaire of this life. For there is nothing expected or required in these Ordinarie, Ciuill, Diuisorie Lots, but what is in the naturall power of the creature therein vsed, the will and consent of the creature making vse of it concurring, as easily to effect, as for a man that hath his lims to walk, or that hath his sight to see: that which may euidently appeare vpon a diligent view of the seuerall examples hereafter ensuing.
               § 2. These Ordinarie Lots againe are of two sorts, either

                      7. q. 17. Serious or Lusorious. Serious I call such as are vsed in serious businesse, be it great or small, weighty or light, so as not matter of meere sport or delight alone, which is the Lot that some of the former Authors terme the Diuisorie Lot, in regard of the frequent vse of it in diuision of lands, goods, chatels, bargaines, exercises, offices, imployments, and the like: And that of which Salomon speaketh where he saith, that 
                     Prov. 18.18. 
                  The Lot stinteth strifes, and maketh partition among the mighty.
               
               Now of this kind of Lot there is great variety of Examples as well in Holy Writ as in prophane Writers. And we may obserue them to haue bene

vsed either for distribution of matters of Office and Charge, or for diuision of possessions &amp; lands, of goods and chatels, or the like.
               Matters of Office or Seruice and Charge distributed by Lot haue bene either Sacred or Ciuill.

               In Generall, the whole body of the Tribe of Levi was by Lot sorted out into rancks.
               For first, 1 Chron. 24.5. ad 20. the Preists were all diuided into twenty foure companies according to their families, which tooke their courses by turnes, euery weeke after weeke in order; the order of their courses being determined by Lot,

               § 4. Now as in assignement of sacred Offices, so in distribution of ciuill Seruices &amp; matter of charge, haue Lots among Gods people beene ordinarily vsed. Two Examples especially are found of it in Scripture.
               The former in a Military matter: where in the Leuites

               The latter Example is in a City businesse; where the same people returned from the Babylonian deportation, 
                     Nehem. 10 34. cast among themselues Lots by Ezra's direction, thereby to designe, who should vndergo the burden for the bearing of the charge &amp; expence, or imploying their paines in fetching and bringing in of wood, to bee spent daily in Gods seruice on the Altar of burnt offrings; the times being then dangerous, and the worke of some difficulty in regard of their enemies that lay in wait for them on euery side.

He draweth each mans name out of the one, and withall a ball out of the other, which if it proue a golden one, he is thereupon admitted, if a siluer one onely, he staieth at least a yeere longer. Againe in the choice of their Officers, not so much the maine Offices, as the Electorships are in part disposed by Lot, somewhat after the manner that

                  Augustus sometime vsed, as not long before

we shewed. For first in the designation of their Duke their principall Magistrate there is Lotery vpon Lotery, lotting and voicing in a prolix and intricate manner enterchangeably mixed the one with the other. 
                     Contaren. de repub. Venet. l. 2. When the place is voide either by deposition, or (as most vsually) by decesse, all their Gentry of 30. yeares of age or vpward (for none vnder are then admitted) are assembled together, and come in order of place as they sit (Lots first cast which side of them shall come first) to the Lotpot, hauing as many balls in it as there be of them in all, whereof 30. onely are gilt: there a childe draweth for each of them, till for 30. of them those 30. gilt ones be drawne. For which 30. the childe draweth againe the second time out of another pot that hath 9. onely gilt ones. The nine so drawne withdraw themselues into a conclaue, where among themselues they name 40. such as haue each of them 6. voices at least. Out of the 40. so named are 12. againe selected by Lot: which 12. among themselues choose 25. each at least by 8. voices. Of these 25. are 9. againe by Lot set apart: which 9. nominate further 45. as before: and those 45. being by Lot againe reduced to eleuen; these eleuen chuse out 41. of the chiefe Senators, which last haue power to elect a Duke. These 41. then after an oath by them seuerally taken to chuse whom they iudge worthiest, and some other solemnities performed, write each of them in a scroll whom hee thinketh good. The scrols are mingled together, and then drawne as they come: and the fitnesse of the person first drawne is discussed: who if he haue

25. voices with him, had wont aunciently to cary it without further adoe. But of latter-times they go on, and he that hath most voices aboue that number, come he first or last to hand, hath the place. If none of them haue voices enough, they beginne againe, and continue till some one be nominated that hath.
               
                  
                     Contar. de Venet. repub. l. 1. Et Postel. de Magistr. Athen. c. 8. Againe in their yeerely assemblies for the choice of other Officers, all their Gentry that haue voice in Councell (none of them excluded) draw first for 60. gilt balls out of two pots by one Lotery, the one halfe out of the one, and the other halfe out of the other: and then those 60. for 36. other gilt ones out of an other pot by a second Lotery. And the 36. that haue thus drawne and lighted on gilden balls twice, haue power to nominate to such Offices as are then to be chosen: which they doe in this manner. They go apart into certaine conclaues by nine and nine in foure companies. Where all those of each company in order of yeeres draw out of a Lot-pot balls with markes vpon them for the seuerall Offices; and according to the ball that each of them hath drawne, he nominateth what Citizen he will for that Office, who if he haue 6. voices of those 9. the party yet holdeth; if not, an other must be nominated by him, till some one be so approued. By this meanes among those foure Companies are there foure Competitors nominated for each of their Offices, whereof one is chosen by most voices of the whole Assembly, the Electors and the whole kindred of the parties nominated being onely first excluded.
               
                  Somewhat after the same manner are they reported to chuse, not their Electors, but their Offices in the Tuscan Estate. For Estates &amp; Empires transl

                   some of late vnderstand this also otherwise. But of this vse euidently was 
                     Louit. 16.1, 9, 10. the Lot that was cast on the two Goates, (for it was meerely diuisory, not diuinatory to tell whether was fitter for the seruice, both being alike fit for it) whereby the one was taken for the Scape-goat to bee saued and sent out aliue, the other left to be slaine and to make a Sinne-sacrifice to God in the behalfe of his people. And these bee all Examples that I finde of this Vse of Lots in holy writ.

               § 1. NOw that Lots of this kinde are lawfull being vsed with due Caution, most Diuines acknowledge, howsoeuer the arguments that some of them bring, are not so sound many of them as were to be wished; and their Cautions the most of them are either vnsound or superfluous, as vpon the view and surveigh of some of them shall appeare.
               In the arguments alleaged for them, the generall error of most Authors is (that which hath also caused much mistaking otherwise) that they confound Ordinarie and Extraordinarie Lots the one with the other, and so reason without reason from the one to the other: As if a man should reason from

                  God approued the Lots practised by 
                  
                     Iosh 7 16.17.18 
                  Ioshua and 
                  1 Sam. 10.20.21 
                  Samuel; for the discouery of Achan, and the election of Saul.
               
               True it is; God approueth whatsoeuer he commaundeth. But Gods approbation of what hee commaundeth, giueth no warrant for what he doth not likewise commaund. That which this Authour himselfe also well saw where he saith, that 
                     Aret. ibid. § 6. 
                  The examples of the Saints are not easily to be imitated. And againe, that

                  what Ioshua did, he did enioyned it by God, which no man may therefore take paterne to doe the like by, vnlesse he haue the like commaundement from God so to doe. And what he saith of Ioshua, may be said also of Samuel.
               
               Fourthly,

                           •
                        nt vsi Aret. ibid. § 4. rat. 4. 
                  In other cases haue godly men likewise laudably vsed Lots. Asin 
                  
                     Luk. 1.9. 
                  the ministery of Zacharie; in 
                  
                     Act. 1.26. 
                  the choise of Matthias; in 
                  1 Sam. 14.41.42. 
                  the discouery of Ionathan: nor are the Lots disallowed that 
                  
                     Ion. 1.7.

                     n cast vpon Ionas.
               
               These examples some of them, as that of Matthias his and the former, were extraordinary actions, done by speciall warrant: others of them, as those of Saul and the Seamen vpon Ionas and Ionathan though not expresly condemned, yet are not allowed, neither can well be justified; and others lastly

of them, as that of Zacharie, are of the point in question, and must by some other ground be proued warrantable.
               Fiftly, 
                     Faciunt ad Dei gloriam; dum Domino deferunt iudicium, &amp;c. Aret. ibid. rat. 5.

               § 2. And of this nature are the arguments that are vsually brought for the confirmation of the truth in this point. Which in regard therefore of the inualidity and insufficiencie of them leauing to their seuerall Authors to make good as they may, we will assay to giue some sounder groundes: And for the present we will presse onely the testimonie of Salomon, where speaking of such kinde of Lots as these are, he saith, that 
                     Prou. 18.1
                        •
                     .

                     ••
                  inteth contentions or suites, and maketh partition among the mightie. In which words the holy Ghost manifestly not alloweth onely and approueth the vse of Lots in such cases, but commendeth it vnto vs as a wife and discreete course for the taking away of controuersies

and questions in this kinde, and the preventing of law-suites or other quarrels that thence otherwise might arise. The place is pregnant, and the proofe expresse, considering whom it is spoken by. Neither shall I neede to spend many words for the present either for the further vrging and enforcing of it, or the seconding of it with other arguments: partly because most Diuines generally concurre in the approbation of them, though their proofes be most of them impertinent; and one euident argument may well suffice in a matter not much controuersed; and partly also because the point will receiue further strength from the arguments that shall

                   hereafter be produced for the next sort of Lots, which are more questionable then these. Whither referring the Reader for fuller satisfaction, we will proceede in the next place to consider of the Cautions necessarily to be obserued in the vse of such Lots.
               § 3. When therefore it is said that such Lots are lawfull, it is not so to be conceiued, as if the meaning were to justifie euery particular instance in that kind that either was formerly produced or euer hath bin practised;

                   particular circumstances many times alter the nature of actions, and make those things oft vnlawfull, that otherwise are not euill; but to approue onely the vse of them in those cases, where by such circumstances it is not corrupted and changed. In regard whereof it is not without iust cause, that those that deale in this argument, and allow the vse of such Lots, are wont to annex certaine Cautions or rules to direct and limite the vse

of them: yet herein failing not a little, in that, as their proofes the most of them are insufficient or impertinent; so their Cautions are many of them either vnsound or superfluous, to wit, such as sort not either with the nature of these Lots, or with the ordinarie vse of them. Wee will first breifly consider of them, and then set downe some other, more apt at least, in the roome of them.
               The first Caution then giuen vsually is that

                  Otherwise to vse Lots were a tempting of God.
               
               But it is not necessary to require any such necessitie, since the thing that is thus put to Lot ought to be a matter of meere indifferency, as hereafter shall appeare; and the course it selfe also is no other. Which therefore euen where diuers waies or courses may be to end a controuersie by, may choise be made of among the rest, being as fit and equall as any of the rest. The suites mentioned by Salomon in 
                     Prou. 18.18. the place before alledged as determinable by Lot, are such as may by other courses also, (as by arbitrement and compromise, or by condescension 
                     Gen 13.89. the one yeelding the choise to the other,) be composed: and therefore it is not necessitie simply, that either enforceth or warranteth the vse of a Lot in them. Neither is there in such case any tempting of God, where there is, as no neede, so no expectance of any extraordinary worke of God. Yea on the other side where the same is either required

or expected, there God is tempted, be the necessitie enforcing the Lot neuer so great.
               The second Caution is that 
                     Peccatur, si quis absque Dei reuerenti

                     Act. 1.24, 25, 26. 
                  was sometime done in the choise of Matthias.
               
               It is true indeede that 1 Cor. 10.31. Coloss. 3.17. nothing ought to be done irreligiously or irreuerently. But yet there is great difference in the religious and reuerent vsage of things, to be meated out and limited by the weight of the worke. In regard whereof there may be no want of due reuerence in some actions, wherein yet such solemnities are not obserued.
               Againe it is no lesse true, that we are to 
                     Luk. 18.1. 1. Thess. 5.17. 
                  pray continually: and that 1. Tim. 48.

                     . Marc. leg. spir.
                   
                  all our actions (euen the least and lightest of them, euen our sports and pastimes, much more all our serious, though ciuill, affaires) are to be sanctified by praier: But how? or in what manner? Not that a man is bound at each seuerall act, as vpon euery bargaine he maketh, or euery peni-worth of ware that he selleth, to fall downe on his knees and conceiue a set praier; no more then to say a new grace for each seuerall course that is brought to the bord, or each seuerall dish that is carued at the bord, or vpon euery other bit of meate that hee putteth into his mouth. The praier conceiued at the beginning of the meale serueth sufficiently for all: and the 
                     Psal. 55.17. &amp; 141.2. Morning sacrifice sanctifieth the whole ordinarie daies worke, though eiaculations, as they tearme them, may be seasonably vsed, as occasion shall require. So here vsually is no other sanctification required then is common to other ciuill affaires:

                        s non est necessaria oratio. Serar. in Iosh. c. 7. q. 21. solemne praier is no more necessarie vnto the vse of a Lot, then it is to any other ordinarie busines whatsoeuer. The instance giuen is of a sacred extraordinarie Lot. And it is no sound course to reason from extraordinarie to ordinarie, from sacred to ciuill, from some particular to the generall.
               A third Caution is that 
                     Vt absit superstitio &amp; curiositas. Martyr. ad 1. Sam. cap. 10. &amp; Aret. probl. par. loc. 67. §. 6. caut. 2. 
                  No superstition or curiositie be mixt with it: but 
                  
                     Euentus á Deobo

                  the euent be religiously expected from God.
               
               Superstition indeed altreth the nature of a Lot, and maketh it not a meere Diuisory but a Diuinatorie Lot: for the paring whereof away therefore some Caution may seeme needfull: as we shall afterward see.
               For the latter Clause: to expect the issue and euent of it, as by ordinarie meanes from God, is common to all actions: to expect it by an immediate and extraordinarie worke is no more lawfull here then else-where, yea is indeed meere superstition, as hereafter we shall shew.
               The fourth and fift Cautions are that 
                     Ne in illicita inquiramus, &amp;c. Aret. ibid. caut. 3. 
                  We inquire not into things vnlawfull by Lot: as what is become 
                  
                     Iosh. 7.16, 17, 18.

goods stolne or lost; or 
                  
                     Ne in futura. Aret. ibid.
                   
                  to foretell what shall be: for that is to turne Lotery into Sorcery.
               
               But such Lots as these are meerely Diuinatorie, (no Diuisory Lots) of which seuerally by themselues.
               A sixth Caution, that 
                     Ne diuina oracula ad terrena negotia conuertantur. ex Aug. epist. 119. c 20. Thom. p. 2a 2ae q. 95. a. 8. Nider. ad praecept. 1. c. 10. Martyr. ad 1. Sam. c. 10. 
                  We vse no texts of Scripture in our Loteries.
               
               It is true indeed generally of all actions, that holy things are not to be applied to prophane vses. But the abuse here touched is in diuinatorie Lots, simply vnlawfull, whether such sacred things bee vsed in them or no.
               A seuenth Caution is, that 
                     Ne in electionibus 
                           •

               For the story here touched, it is diuersly reported by Authors, and in some particulars mistaken by

him that alledgeth it. We shal haue occasion 
                     Infra cap. 12. §. 6. hereafter more particularly to relate it. Meanewhile this may suffice, that, howsoeuer that which is here touched and the like guilefull courses are vniust and consequently vnlawfull, especially where both parties haue an interest in that that is to be shared: For I dare not condemne Caesars slight who in punishing of his mutinous troupes, where it was in his owne power to slay or saue whom he would,

                        . 41. carried the matter so cunningly, that the Lot lighted on those that had beene faultiest and forwardest in that busines. Howsoeuer, I say, such injurious and coosening conueiances are vnwarrantable: Yet this Caution seemeth needlesse, because the very nature of a Lot excludeth all such courses: and therefore to giue such a Caution concerning a Lot, is as if a man should say that A Lot must be a Lot, or else it cannot be a lawfull Lot. For where the euent is determined by such counsels or courses, there is there no casualtie, and so consequently no Lotery. Whereas the Question is here how a man may lawfully vse a Lot, not whether he may not vse some other course in steede of a Lot, when he pretendeth to vse it.
               § 4. These are most of the Cautions most commonly giuen; in steede whereof, because the most of them are not so materiall, it shall not be amisse to propound some other that may more precisely limite the vse of this kinde of Lots, and meete with the abuses most vsuall in such.
               Now these Cautions may bee referred to two heades; they concerne either the matter wherein they are vsed, or the manner of vsing them.
               
                  Concerning the matter or businesses wherein Lots may lawfully be vsed the rule of Caution in generall is this that Lots are to be vsed in things indifferent onely. Which Caution that it may be the better conceiued, a word or two will doe well for the explication of the word Indifferent vsed in it. The rather for that some there be that suppose that there is no Act at all Indifferent; and so according to their judgement, if Lots may be vsed in things indifferent onely, they may not be vsed at all. True it is that in the Schooles there are two receiued Axiomes that may seeme the one to crosse the other, to wit, that 
                     Omnis actio est adiaphora.
                   
                  Euery action is indifferent; and that 
                     Nulla actio est adiaphora. Vise Gerson. in regul. mor.
                   
                  No action is indifferent: which seeming contradiction they yet salue with a distinction of 
                     Omnis nuda; nulla vestita.
                   
                  naked and clothed, that euery naked or bare action simply conceiued is indifferent, but no action clad with his particular circumstances is indifferent. For example, say they, to strike is indifferent, but to strike an Innocent, or to strike without authority, or to strike in this or that case, this or that Person, is not so. But to come neerer home to that wee haue now in hand: The word indifferent may be taken two waies, either as it opposed to Good and Euill, and more specially to such actions of virtue and vice as deserue more speciall either praise or reproofe; or as it is opposed to necessary good duties, such things as must needes be done, and so consequently also to Euills simply forbidden, which in that regard may in no wise be done. In the former sense is that said to be

                   it bindeth him not to doe all good at once or at all times; so that many good things there are that may at sometime be done, whereof a man may make choise whether of them he will doe, being not necessarily tied vnto or enjoyned any one of them: As for a student hauing diuers bookes about him in his study it is indifferent to choose one this or that, refusing the rest, for present imployment, there being no speciall occasion to vrge the vse of one more then of another: Or

                   for a man that carieth a paire of kniues about him, it is indifferent to draw and vse either when occasion requireth. And of this nature in this Caution is the thing required to be, that is put to a Lot, to wit, such as a man may lawfully either chuse or refuse

               § 5. Now this Caution diuideth it selfe into two distinct branches according to the diuers qualitie

of those things that oppose to, or swarne from this indifferencie.
               The former is that Lots may not bee vsed in ought euidently vnlawfull or in it selfe euill, either in the omission of some necessarie good dutie, or in the yeelding to ought simply wicked, vngodly, or vniust, and so consequently where at the present it is euidently apparent vpon other grounds what a man ought to chuse or to refuse. For a Lot, as we haue seene, is casuall: and to put a necessarie act to a casuall euent, cannot be without sinne, since it maketh that casual and contingent which Gods law maketh necessarie. 
                     Deut. 5.32. &amp; 12.32 &amp; 27.26. In such cases therefore a man is to follow the grounds and to be led by the rules of religion and reason; and not to put that to hazard whether he shall doe it or no, for which hee seeth and knoweth already good grounds why he should doe it or not doe it. What a man seeth euident grounds against, that he may not doe: and looke what hee may not lawfully doe, that hee may not put to hazard whether he shall doe or no. And on the other side what a man seeth necessarie ground for, that he is necessarily bound to doe: what he is necessarily bound vnto, he may not refuse or forbeare to doe: and wha

               To illustrate this by some instances. Where many stand for an office either in Church or Commonweale, whereof some are fit, some are altogether vnfit for it, or some fitter, some lesse fit with very manifest difference, in this case for those persons in whose power it is to call and admit thereunto,

               § 6. And thus was the former branch of this Caution that Lots are not to be vsed either in necessarie duties or things in themselues euill, such as may euidently at the present appeare to be such.
               The latter branch is that Lots may not be vsed in such things, though not otherwise in themselues euill, where by consequence the vse of them may in likelihood proue Inconuenient or Inexpedient.
               The reason is apparent; because

                   things indifferent and such as are good and lawfull in themselues, become vnlawfull vnto vs when they grow Inconuenient or Inexpedient in the vse of them.
               In matters therefore of indifferencie that of themselues

are not euill, yet are such as by some circumstance they may easily become euill, great regard ought to be had of the conueniencie and expediencie of them. Where vnder the head of inconueniencie I comprehend all such things, as may tend to any outward euill: vnto the head of Inexpediency I referre all such things as may bring a man within danger of some spirituall euill.
               For the former point of Conueniencie and Inconueniencie the rule is, that because things in themselues otherwise lawfull and warrantable may seeme Conuenient in some respects, and Inconuenient in others, that therefore where the Conueniences and the Inconueniences shall be laid in an euen ballance of equall and indifferent iudgement, either against' other the action is to be deemed either Conuenient or Inconuenient, as the one side shall appeare to weigh downe the other: that is to say, The Conueniences being more or weightier make the thing questioned Conuenient, the Inconueniences being more and weightier make it iustly deemed Inconuenient.
               To apply this to the present; In the Vse of a Lot about a matter of it selfe otherwise not euill, if the Conueniences shall be so many and so weighty on the one side, that they may wel weigh downe whatsoeuer Inconueniences may be produced on the other side, there the action is Conuenient, and a Lot therefore lawfull: but contrariwise where the Inconueniences that shall necessarily or in good probability appeare to accompanie the thing questioned or ensue vpon the doing of it shall be such and

so great, as the Conueniences that stand on the other side shall not be able to counteruaile, there the action is worthily disallowed as Inconuenient, and a Lot consequently vnlawfull.
               Thus in publike affaires for the giuing of some few priuate men contentment to admit a Lot where the admission of it may in likelihood proue preiudiciall to the publike, were an vnwise course and an vnwarrantable, because the publike weighing down the priuate maketh the action inconuenient. Where it is worth the obseruing that albeit among the Romanes the ordinary imployments of their Officers, and many other affaires were ordered oft-times by Lot, yet

being no other then he may well forgo; yet for a man in such a case to put that to the hazard of a Lot, when he may otherwise recouer it, which his estate will not beare, or may be otherwise more preiudiciall both to him and his, were not lawfull, because the damage that thereby might accrue, would be greater, then could free such an action from imputation of euident inconuenience.

                  Needlesse therefore and vnnecessarie Loteries though in things otherwise not vnlawfull, where they are likely to cause, or by experience are found to occasion much sinne, are so farre forth vnwarrantable, because in that regard inexpedient. In respect whereof howsoeuer it were no vnwarrantable course, in a matter of common or publike benefit, as the reparation of a bridge, reedifying of an Hospitall, erecting of a schoole or the like, for diuers men of good ability to agree among themselues to put it to hazard what summes each of them shall disburse or dispend toward the discharge or support thereof, the summes being no greater then the estate of any of them may well beare, when they cannot readily agree vpon a rate otherwise; as also for the better encouragement of either other in that kinde, in common equally to contribute toward the price of a iewell, or some one of them to conuert his part into some such commodity, to bee conferred vpon some one of them so contributing, whom by Lot it shall light to, their mindes and states probably knowne either to other, I see here no reason why it should be vnlawfull. But for a man in this kinde to put that to hazard which he knoweth or probably suspecteth that he shall be vnable well, or vnwilling on such tearmes to part with; the losse whereof in that regard may either disable him to the doing of other necessarie duties, or distemper him and so make him guilty of sinne in Gods sight; or to ioyne with others needlesly in such an act, much more to draw them in and incite them thereunto, whom he knoweth not vpon good presumptions

to bee both able and willing; by meanes whereof they may be occasioned to sinne in the same sort; especially in such an action as he cannot but see to be so carried that many abuses are committed in it, and occasion giuen by it of much euill; I cannot see how a man should be free from sin in so doing; neither can I conceiue with what comfort of conscience a man can receiue or retaine what a Lot in such a case shall cast vpon him, comming in all likelihood in part out of the purses of those, as either are altogether vnable to part well with such summes, but haue strained themselues thereunto out of a greedy desire and hope of lucre and gaine; or being vnwilling to loose and to part with what they put in, doe in that regard wretchedly curse and blaspheame Gods name for the losse of it.

Which occasions of euill being seene or foreseene, cannot but make such Loteries vnlawfull to all those that partake in them, in regard of the inconueniencie, and inexpediencie that is in them. The more able therefore and willing a man may be to sustaine such losse as by Lot may befall him, the lawfuller the Lot is. And the better knowne they are to be such whom a man dealeth with in matter of Lot, especially where the occasion is rather voluntary then necessary, the more warrantable is the Lot.
               To conclude briefly the grounds of this twofold caution: the euent of Lot is casuall: but the doing of Gods wil in the auoiding of things euil either in thē
                  selues or by consequence is necessarie: and therfore no sit matter to be put to the casuall euent of a Lot. Againe the vse of a Lot is to determine some question

or doubt: but no question ought to be made or doubt to be moued, of the committing of any morall euill, or the omitting of any necessary good duty, of the doing what God forbiddeth, or the not doing what he enioyneth: no Lot therefore may lawfully be vsed about such. Lastly what a man may not doe though a Lot should determine it, that it is in vaine to put to the determination of a Lot: but

In regard whereof the greater the indifferencie is in the euent of it which way soeuer it fall out, the more lawfull the Lot is: and so (contrary to that which is commonly deliuered and almost generally receiued,) the lesse weighty the matter is wherein a Lot is vsed, the lawfuller the Lot is.
               § 8. Now these Cautions were concerning the matter wherein Lots are vsed: there follow two other concerning the manner how they are to be vsed in such matters.
               Where the former Caueat or Caution is that a man be willing to forgo and part with what he putteth to the hazard of a Lot: as before for the matter

it selfe, that it be such as he may be willing to part withall: (for that a man may be willing sometime to part with, what he may not lawfully part with) so now for the disposition of the partie in such an action, that he be willing', if it shall so fall out, to sustaine some losse, and so much losse, as may befall him by the Lot. The reason is euident: because otherwise a man doth that vnaduisedly that may afterward discontent him, and be an occasion of sin to him. Againe that which is put to the hazard of a Lot is in a manner forgone, so farre forth, as it is put thereunto. A man ought therefore to be willing to forgo that, if the Lot shall put it from him, which he is content to cast vpon the Lot, which may put it from him.
               But here may some say, Is a man then bound to be willing to depart with his knowne right, because he may in some cases commit it to such hazard? or may hee not in such case lawfully desire to obtaine it?
               I answere: As 1. Cor. 6.7. a man is bound not absolutely but conditionally to depart with his right, when a greater euill may ensue vpon the recouery of it by such meanes as he hath onely to recouer the same by, though he may lawfully otherwise desire to obtaine it: so in this case where a man is willing rather to loose it, then to seeke it by other courses, and as willing to put it to the hazard of a Lot as to loose it, (for else were it a folly for him to put it thereunto) he ought to be no lesse willing, hauing yeelded so farre, to part with it, when it shall be so past; howsoeuer he might otherwise not vnlawfully desire,

what he might lawfully retaine, if with conueniencie it might be had.
               The rule then here is that no man put that to the hazard of a Lot, which he could not be willing to forgo vpon the like tearmes without it.
               § 9. The last Caution is that no

                        urum se minimié repromisit. Delrio. mag tom. 3. l. 4. c. 4. q. 1. he hath no where promised any speciall prouidence in such cases, to doe men right by such meanes, to iustifie their quarrels,
to direct the Lot as the equitie of the cause shall require, or to interpose himselfe and his prouidence in such courses otherwise then in any other of our actions, be they casuall, contingent or necessarie. And therefore to put ought to hazard with expectation of such an act of Gods prouidence is to presume of that which God hath not promised: (that wherein many of the Heathens Loteries were not free from some fault) to make triall of it is to tempt God; I meane, to put ought to the hazard of a Lot to this end, thereby to trie whether God will in such speciall manner interpose himselfe for our benefit, the recouery of our right, or the clearing of our cause; that is in effect, whether he will extraordinarily worke for vs at our will. Which therefore as to presume or expect before hand without good ground is hardly religious; so to conclude ought to that purpose afterward from the issue and euent

of it, is vndoubtedly superstitious.
               In Lots therefore of this nature,

In diuision therefore of Lands made as equall as may be with conueniencie, yet so as there is still some apparent inequalitie, in regard that the things cannot well otherwise be parted, for a man because in equitie he hath right to the best part, as the eldest in an inheritance that goeth equally among all, to expect an extraordinarie hand of God for the disposing of it according to the right as in equitie it ought to go, is vnwarrantable.
               As also to conclude, when two stand for a place, that the one is fitter and more sufficient for it then the other, because the question betweene them being put to Lot, the Lot lighted on him, as if God by that euent had giuen sentence on his side, is no lesse vnwarrantable.
               
                  § 10. The rules then here are first, that Lots determine no right: and that

                         sed vt quod ratione diffiniri non potest, saltem fortunae relinquatur. Thom. de sort. c. 4. Lots consequently are to be vsed in these cases not for matter of right, but for matter of fact onely, and that not of fact past, but of fact future alone; not 
                     In causis iudicialibus aut criminalibus vti non licet. Baro in Ien. cap. 1. Nam quod hus traehunt Chytr. in Iud. c. 1. &amp; Lauat. in Prou. c. 16.

                   to decide who hath best right to the better part, or who is fittest for the place, but to determine which of them shall haue it and enioy it, or shall go away with it. Else we make it not an ordinarie but an extraordinarie, not a meere diuisory but a diuinatory Lot, a Lot for diuination, not a Lot onely for diuision, which, as we shall shew afterward, is vtterly vnlawfull.
               And whereas in tearmes the ciuill Lawiers seeme to say the contrarie, where they say that

                  Lots are to be vsed not in question of Fact, but in question of Right: yet in sense they accord with that which we here say, the Lawyers meaning being this alone, that Lots are not to be vsed in question of 
                     Si factum incertum est, dicenti incumbit probatio. Panorm. ad 5. decretal. de sortileg. In facti incertitudine, satius est

                         prounciare, non liquere, quàm sorti rem commit: ere. Greg. Tholoss. de appell. l. 2. c. 19. Fact past, where the question is whether a thing be done or not done; for that is no ordinarie Lot able to decide; but where some question is who hath right to a thing, in which case notwithstanding the Lot is not vsed to determine who in truth hath right to it, but who for peace and quietnesse sake shall enioy it, where the right cannot be determined, or who shall haue possession of it, till the right be determined.
               Secondly, that no censure of right or wrong bee grounded vpon Lots: as that no extraordinarie power or prouidence be expected, so nothing to that purpose vpon the euent of it be concluded, as

if it ought to haue beene or gone so, or it was Gods approuing will that it should be so, because so it hath falne out.
               But doth not the worke it selfe, may some say, manifest Gods will? I answere; there is a twofold will of God, a disposing will, and a directing will; a will enforming and a will ouer-ruling: a will prescribing what should be, and a will preordaining what shall be. 
                     Non fit aliquid, nisi omniposens fieri velit, vel sinendo, vel ipse faciendo. Aug. enchir. c. 95. When ought therefore is falne out be it good or bad, it is apparent indeed that it was Gods will either to performe it or to permit it. For 
                     Rom 9.19. Matth. 10.29. nothing can possibly come to passe either without or against his will. But that it ought in right to haue beene so, cannot thence be concluded. Else might we conclude that the Iewes ought to haue crucified Christ, because God suffred them so to doe, yea 
                     Act. 2.23. &amp; 4.28. he preordained the doing of it. In this case therefore where the matter is put to a Lot by those in whose power it is so to dispose of it, it may be truely said, that it was Gods will, to wit, his disposing will, that the Lot should go as it hath gone: But it is no consequent therefore, that according to Gods directing or enforming will, it ought in regard of right so to haue gone as it hath.

               In or about Game therefore is a Lot said to be vsed, when either the ioyning and beginning, or the issue and euent of it is put to some casualty either in whole or in part.

For sometime the ioyning or beginning of a game or sport onely is put to a Lot: As when by it is determined who shall play and who stay out, or who shall ioyne on a side: which in shooting is done vsually by shuffling of arrowes together behinde

some one mans backe, and then casting them aside the one halfe one way and the other halfe an other way; in bowling by casting a certaine number of boules belonging to seuerall men out of one mans armes at once, and those mating whose bowles meete neerest together: Or of the two sides whether shall leade and beginne; which at Tables is decided commonly by the casting of most points; in Ches-play by turning a pawne on the bord according to the colour of the square or quarter that it staieth or resteth vpon, or by the ones guessing at two pawnes hidde in the others two hands.

                   one of the latter ranke of them, that some of the reasons produced by the former for the disallowing of the one kinde, if the grounds be admitted, cannot chuse but condemne both kindes. For if the one be euill and not allowable because they depend vpon Lot and Chance, then the other must likewise be euill and vnwarrantable so far forth as in part also they depend thereupon. And on the other side if those former Authors will avow and iustifie the one, they cannot but secretly withall giue sentence also for the other, since they stand both on the same ground, and are built both on one botome.

                  For the argument that 
                     Perkins Cases of Consc. l. 3. c. 4. § 3. q. 2. a reuerend Writer of ours bringeth to proue the contrary, because in a Lot there are two 
                     •
                  hings required; first a casuall act, and secondly an applying of that casuall act to the determination of some particular and vncertaine euent; whereas the dealing of the Cards is a casuall act indeed, but the determination of the vncertaine victory is not in mixt games meerely from it, but much or most from the wit and skill or the will of the player: and therefore the dealing of the cards is no more a Lot then the dealing of almes is, when the Princes Almoner putteth his hand into his pocket, and giueth one man six pence, another 12. pence, another two pence, what commeth foorth without further aduice. This argument, I say, is not sound, because it reasoneth from a particular to a generall; The dealing of the Cards is not applied to the determining of this vncertaine euent, to wit, the maine issue of the game or the victory: therefore it is not applied to the determining of any vncertaine euent at all. Which consequence is vnsound; as also the consequent is vntrue. For it is manifest that the dealing of the cards is applied to the determining of this vncertaine euent, what cards or casts each one shall haue to exercise his skill with: and is therefore euen by his owne description a Lot: as is also the dealing of almes in that sort, if it be done for that end, to trie what will casually fall to each ones share by such a course, as well as if it were done by drawing of rushes or cuts, which go commonly for Lots.
               For the thing it selfe I hold that these Lusorious Lots, and Games consisting of such are not simply

or in that regard euill or vnwarrantable: or in a word, that a Lot vsed in game is not vnlawfull. In which assertion if I shall dissent from some others of religion and learning, whom otherwise I worthily respect and imbrace, I desire but to haue my grounds duly viewed and examined, that if they proue firme and sound, the frame built on them may stand, if weake and vnsound, it may fall before the truth, as 1. Sam. 5.4. 
                  Dagon did before Gods Arke, my selfe promising to lend an hand with the first to the ouerturning and razing of what I now reare, if it shall be shewed me to be other then is warrantable by Gods word.
               § 4. The former grounds therefore laid concerning the nature of Lots in generall, the reasons that induce me to allow Lots of this kinde as not euill in themselues among others are these.
               First, that which may be ordinarily vsed in other ciuill affaires, bee they more weighty or of lesse weight, that may also be vsed for matter of recreation and delight. But a Lot may be ordinarily vsed in other ciuill affaires, as, by the expresse

The word vsed there, though in its originall propriety it signifie

That therefore that best sorteth with the nature of a Lot, may a Lot most lawfully be vsed vnto: but the lightest matters best sort with the nature of a Lot: and therefore about things of that nature may a Lot most lawfully be vsed. Or more particularly for the present busines: A matter of meere indifferency, that is, such as a man may lawfully either doe or not doe, and it is not materiall whether he do or omit, such may a man lawfully put either to the will of an other, or to the hazard of the vncertaine motion of any creature whether he shall doe it or not doe it. But the vsing of a Lot in game (or the vsing of it in any busines, be it serious or lusorious, qualified and cautioned as before) is but the putting of a matter of meere indifferency to the hazard of an vncertaine euent, to wit, who shall ioine or stand out, who shall leade or follow, who shall ouercome or yeeld to the other side &amp;c. which are matters meerely indifferent, such as may without sinne bee either done or forborne, either

done the one way or the other. The Vse therefore of a Lot in such cases, and the putting of such matters to the hazard of a Lot is not euill simply in it selfe.

               But the Vse of Lots in game is not in it selfe, or of it selfe a sinne either against Piety, or against Charitie.
               To spend time and words in proouing that the vse of a Lot in game as it is a Lot, is not against Charitie, as that it is no breach of Charity for men to draw Cuts or cast Arrowes, who shall boule or shoote first, were both superfluous and ridiculous; superfluous, because it were to proue what no man denieth; ridiculous, because it were to confute what no wise man wil avow. And yet to charge a lusorious Lot with Impietie, hath as little ground as the other.
               For the manifesting here of let thus much be considered, that all Impiety may be referred to these 
                     Ezech 22.4.26. two heads, either the prophaning of hallowed things, or the hallowing of things prophane: since it cannot be imagined how any impiety should be

committed but either by denying holy things their due respect, or by giuing the same where it is not due. But lusorious Lots are not of themselues guilty in either of these kindes. In the latter kinde euen their greatest aduersaries will cleare them, there being no colour to charge them with the hallowing of ought that is not otherwise holy. And in the former kinde they may be cleared also by the grounds of Gods Law, to wit, from the prophaning of ought that is holy. For the thing vsed in them is a Lot: and nothing can bee prophaned by them but what is vsed in them: (by Lots, I meane simply as they are Lots, for to make Lots of holy things, as of parcels of Scripture, or of the Elements consecrate in the Sacrament, &amp;c. is not any thing concerning the nature of a Lot, but an abuse cleauing to it in some particular mens practise of it, and such as is to be seuered therefore in this our discourse from it.) But a Lot is no holy thing, either of it selfe and in it owne nature, or by vertue of any diuine institution. For of these two sorts are all holy things whatsoeuer, either they are holy of themselues and in their owne nature, as

casuall euent applied to the determining or deciding of some doubt: Where the matter of it, a meere casualtie, as it is a casualtie hauing no holinesse at all in it of it selfe (for

               Neither is a Lot holy by any diuine institution; since euery such institution must haue warrant from some word; and there cannot be produced any word of institution whereby Lots are specially sanctified and set apart to such vses as may bring them within the compasse of things holy and sacred.

               Those therefore are amisse that allow Lots in game, and yet adde for a Caution, that great reuerence and religionsnesse be vsed in the action; in regard that

                  Holy things must be done in holy manner. For if Lots in generall euen ciuill as well as sacred be holy things, they may in no case with no Caution bee made matter of sport and pastime, or of gamesome

recreation; nor can the light vse of them be so corrected and qualified, but that it will haue deadly poyson euen in the heart and pith of it, not adhering or cleauing vnto the barke or outside of it only. But ciuill Lots are not such; and therefore the lusorious vse of them is not the prophaning of any holy thing. And if neither the vnhallowing of any thing hallowed, nor the hallowing of any thing vnhallowed, then can it not be brought within compasse of impiety or sinne against the first Table. And if it be cleared from all sinne against the first Table, and be not charged by any with any sinne against the second Table; it must needes rest discharged of all sinne in generall, and consequently be iustified as agreeable to Gods word.

                  Christian recreation is the exercise of something indifferent for the necessarie refreshing of body or minde.
               
               The assumption, namely, that Lotery is a thing in it owne nature indifferent, is thus proued likewise by their definition of things in nature indifferent. 
                     Idem ibid. § 2. rule 1.

                      are not simplie commaunded or forbidden to vse it, but as we shall finde it in Christian wisedome beneficiall or hurtfull vnto vs. But such is Lotery, or the vse of Lots; not simply commaunded, (for 
                     Prou 18.18. that of Salomon before alledged is rather a permission then a precept, or not so much a commaundement as an aduice and counsell, commending that to vs as a wise and prudent course, not enioining or imposing it as a dutie necessarie to be done, seeing by other courses beside it such controuersies may without sinne be composed as are there mentioned, and that effected oft by other meanes without a Lot, for

which a Lot by Salomon is there allowed) nor againe any where forbidden or condemned as euill in it selfe: by the former definition therefore conseuently in different, and so lawfull matter of Christian recreation and delight.
               § 9. Sixtly and lastly, that the Vse of Lots in game is not against Gods word, but hath sufficient warrant from it, may appeare by this argument. Where the wisedome of God in his word hath not determined the matter, and the manner, or the other circumstances of a thing lawfull in it selfe, there they are least to mans discretion and wisedome. Else should wee hang euer in perpetuall suspence, hauing no rule at all to direct vs by in them. And where they are left thus to mans discretion and wisedome, there is warrant sufficient for any circumstance that man shall make choise of (the Magistrate publikely to enioyne, or priuate persons to practise) that shall

               For the better conceiuing of this point it is to be considered, that for the doing of euery act, and the doing of it in this or that manner, if naturall reason will not of it selfe afford sufficient direction, there must be warrant had out of Gods word: and a man must know that he hath warrant thence, because

                  allowable by Gods Law, for the doing whereof there is either precept or permission in Gods word, and that either direct and expresse, or collected by just consequence:

               Secondly for the subiect matter, the manner of it and other such circumstances, where they are by Gods word determined, there such onely are lawfull as the word of God hath enioyned.
               Where they are not determined, there all such are lawfull as the same word 
                     Concessum videtur quod non prohibetur. Accurs. ad Cod I

                     Matth. 12.30. Omnia sunt probibita, quae non reperiuntur concessa. Gloss. ad Dig. l. 47. c. 23. l. 3. 
                  He that is not with me, is against me: in the latter that other, 
                     Luk. 9.50. Omnia per legem sunt permissa, qu
                           •
                         non inueniuntur prohibitae. Gloss. ad D. l. 4. t. 6. l. 28. 
                  He that is not against me, is with me. Thus for sacrifice and the place of it, before it was determined, 
                     Deut. 12.8.9. Gen. 8.20. &amp; 12.7. &amp; 13.18. &amp; 20.25. &amp; 26 25. &amp; 33.20. Exod. 17.15 &amp; 14.4. it was lawfull in any place, because no certaine place was designed: but after it was once determined, 
                     Deut. 12.5, 6, 11, 13, 14. it was lawfull in no place but that alone, that God had expressely thereunto assigned. So for the Passeouer and other offerings, and the time and season of either, the ordinary sacrifices (I meane the voluntary or freewill offerings) 
                     Leu. 1.2, 3. &amp; 2.1. Deut. 12.5, 6, 26, 27. might be offered at any time, because for them was no time determined: but 
                     Exod. 12.6. Num 9 13. the Passeouer might be celebrated onely at one time, because the time of it was determined.
               This would the rather be obserued for the readier answering of some friuolous obiections made by

some Seperatists; What warrant, say they, haue you to vse this or that forme of praier, or to pray vpon a booke? I answere; It is warrant sufficient that 
                     Luk. 18.1. 1. Thess. 5.17. 1. Tim. 2.1.8. wee are enioyned to vse praier, and 
                     Matth. 6 9.12. Act. 8.22. 1. Iohn 1.9. such kinde of praier, confession of sin, and supplication for pardon, &amp;c. no set forme thereof determined; therefore any fit forme warrantable: this forme that we vse not vnfit otherwise; this forme therefore allowable. And let a man demaund of one of them when he praieth, what warrant he hath to vse that forme that he then vseth, he can answer no otherwise; or if in effect otherwise, he shall answer otherwise then well. So for a booke; the meanes of helpe are not determined; and this one among others; this therefore not vnwarrantable. And if one of them should be asked, how he proueth it warrantable to vse a printed booke to reade on in the Church; hee shall not be able to make other answer then as before: for neither precept nor practise can be found in the word for the vse of a thing that was not knowne in those times wherein the word of God was written.
               §. 10. But to applie this to the present. First, 
                     Eccles. 3.4. Zech. 3.10. &amp; 8.5. Recreation in generall is granted by all to haue good warrant from Gods word, as a thing both allowed by permission, and enioyned by precept, if not directly and expresly, yet at least by iust consequence: and therefore I will not stand vpon the proofe of it.
               Secondly, for the matter and manner of it, 
                     •
                  or the things wherewith wee may recreate our selues,

Coloss. 3 17. of religion and pietie, and the like, are by the word of God allowed, and haue from thence sufficient warrant. For example; If question be whether Boules or Chesse be lawfull or no: what can there be said in iustification of them more then this, that recreation in generall is by Gods word allowed; the matter of it in particular not determined: these games not prohibited; therefore lawfull and allowable. Now the very same may be said of Lots and Lotterie. Game in generall is allowed: no particular matter or manner of it prescribed: any therefore lawfull that is not against the generall rules of Gods word; this of Lotterie such; and therefore allowable.

without any reason or sufficient cause rendred why it should be questioned and condemned in that sort.
               And so I conclude and leaue this sixt and last reason taken from the common grounds of other ordinary recreations not questioned, which must all with this either stand or fall, the selfe same grounds supporting either; that this particular is not prohibited, nor is against the general rules of Gods word otherwise; which as in the former, so in this case must stand good, till the contrary can be proued.
            
            
               CHAP. VII. Answere to the principall Obiections made against lusorious Lots.
               § 1. BVt here will some of the former Authors obiect and say, we can shew how this kind of disport or recreation by Lots, and the vse of a Lot in such cases is against the generall rules of Gods word. And so I come to examine the seuerall obiections that are by seuerall men brought against this kinde of disport. Wherein I will deale as ingenuously, and as indifferently as I am able to doe; propound their arguments as I finde them, and as many as I finde of them, not picking out the weakest and passing by the pithiest, or setting downe some part or peece of them and concealing the residue; but as neere as I can, gather all I can finde in such Writers as I can vnderstand to haue dealt in this argument, and enforcing them as farre as

themselues doe to their best strength.
               Now this that I may the more orderly doe, their arguments shall all of them be referred to these two heads, the principall, and the lesse principall.
               The principall Arguments I call such as tend to proue them simply vnlawfull, and so euill in themselues.
               The lesse principall such as tend to proue them inconuenient and inexpedient, or such as haue been by the most or the best generally disallowed and condemned.
               The former may againe be sorted into two rankes according to the two Tearmes of the thing questioned, A Lot vsed in recreation, or Recreation by a Lot: for either they are taken from a Lot and the nature of it, or the proper vse and end of it; or from the nature of recreation, and the vse and end of it.
               § 2. The first maine Argument then is taken from the nature of a Lot, which is affirmed to bee a worke of Gods speciall and immediate prouidence, a sacred oracle, a diuine iudgement or sentence: the light vse of it therefore to be an abuse of Gods name; and so a sinne against the third Commaundement.
               The Argument is by diuers Authours diuersly moulded. From Gods speciall and immediate prouidence they reason first on this wise.

                  But in euery Lot is an especiall and immediate prouidence of God.
                  No Lot therefore is lightly or vainely to be vsed.
               
               
                  The Proposition of this Syllogisme (such as it is) is further confirmed by an Argument taken from the tenor of the third Commaundement.

                      Gods name is not lightly or vainely to be vsed.
                  Gods Prouidence is Gods name.
                  Gods Prouidence therefore is not lightly or vainely to be vsed.
               
               The Assumption is confirmed by two testimonies: the one diuine, a sentence of Salomons, 
                  
                     Dan. ibid.
                   
                  The Lot is cast into the lap, but the whole disposition of it is of the Lord: 
                  
                     Fennor of recreat. rule spec. 4. 
                  So that the nature of a Lot lieth wholy in this that although the things be of vs, yet the disposition is wholy of God: that is, hee vseth not here our meanes of cunning, practise, strength, stedinesse of hand or such like, but taketh it wholy to himselfe. The other humane, a saying of Hierome, 
                  
                     Eastie histor. of Gospell. 
                  Hierome saith a Lot is an hidden and incomprehensible predestination, ruled by God: who dare play with this then?
               
               First the principall Syllogisme it selfe is not sound, there are foure Tearmes, as they say, in it. I shew it by the like Paralogisme built of the same frame and set vpon the same ground.
               
                  Gods Prouidence, being his name, is not to be vsed lightly, or to recreation and disport.
                  But in all things, or in euery action that is, there is a Prouidence of God.
                  No thing or action therefore may be vsed to disport.
               
               And so all recreations shall bee vtterly cut off. This and that are both of one making: but neither of both sound: the conclusion therefore followeth not, albeit the premises were both true.
               Secondly, the Assumption is not sound: it is not

true that in euery Lot is a speciall and immediate Prouidence of God.
               
               For the discouery hereof let two grounds formerly laid be remembred.
               The former, that 
                     Chap. 2. §. 4. conclus. 1. the act of the Creator and the act of the Creature are in these cases to be distinguished. The casuall euent in regard of the Creature is one thing, and Gods prouidence directing and ruling or ouer-ruling it, as all other actions, is an other thing. A man may play therefore with the one, and yet not with the other: as we doe in those things that are not casuall, but are caried and managed by mans Arte and industrie, and yet are accompanied also with Gods prouidence.
               The latter, that 
                     Ibid § 5 concius. 2. it is not the casualtie of an Euent that maketh it a worke of Gods immediate Prouidence. For many things are casuall, which yet are not workes of Gods immediate prouidence, nor imply his speciall presence. Whereas if a Lot in regard of the casualtie of it were a worke of Gods immediate prouidence, and did in that regard imply his speciall and extraordinarie presence, then all casuall euents should be such. For 
                     Quod conuenit tali, quatenus tale, conuenit omni tali.
                   that which agreeth to a thing as it is such or such, agreeth necessarily to all things that are such. But for a foule to flie before a man on his way, or for a dog to crosse a mans boule in play, and that it may be, where there is no likelihood of doing well otherwise, implieth not any speciall or immediate Prouidence: no more therefore doth a Lot.
               §. 3. But let vs examine the proofes brought to strengthen this part. First for the sentence of Salomon,
                  
there want not good Authors that expound it of

So that a man may as well, and vpon as good ground out of the places concerning all other mens speeches and actions alleadged by themselues, (together with those other, which are some of them yet more generall and of larger extent) exclude all things else whatsoeuer from game, as they may Lots, in regard of ought that concerning them can be picked out of this place.
               § 4. If it be obiected, that It ruleth in all: but in the most by meanes; in a Lot it is immediate: which therefore to dally with is dangerous. East. hist. Gosp. reas. 5. there is an immediate prouidence of God euer in the one but not vsually in the other.
               I answere, that indeed is presumed, that in euery Lot there is an immediate prouidence of God: but it is not yet proued: yea (though that be more then my taske requireth: 
                     Agenti incumlit probatio. Martian. in Dig. lib. 22. tit. 3. log. 21. &amp; 23. he that saith it should make it good) it may thus be disproued.

                  First if in euery Lot there be necessarily an immediate worke and prouidence of God, then is it in the naturall power of man to make God worke immediately at his pleasure: for it is in mans power naturally to cast Lots at his pleasure. But to say that it is in mans power naturally to set God on working immediately at his pleasure, is absurd. There is not therefore an immediate worke and prouidence necessarily in euery Lot.
               Againe who seeth it not that the lighting of Lots in this or that manner ordinarily commeth immediately from the act of the Creature? For example: In the blending of scrols or tickets together, the motion of the vessell wherein they are blended (no regard had to the end for which it is done) causeth some to ly this way and some to ly that way, (euery new shaking thereof causing a new sorting) and so some to ly higher and neerer at hand, if a man will draw of the next, some lower and further of, not likely to be drawne so soone, vnlesse he diue deeper. Neither can any man say certainely that there is ordinarily any speciall hand of God, in the shuffling and sorting of them, crossing the course of nature, or the naturall motion of the creature, and so causing those to ly higher and so neerer at hand, that would otherwise haue lien lower, and those to ly lower and so further from hand that would otherwise haue lien higher. So in the shuffling of Cards, the hand of him that shuffleth them is it that disposeth them, and that diuersly as he listeth either to stay or to continue that act of his. In the casting of dice the violence of the Caster causeth the Creature

cast to moue, till either that force failing, or some opposite body hindring it, it cease to moue further, and so determine the chance.
               Yea suppose two agree to decide a doubt by the cards, as they come where they ly (left by those that last vsed them) without further adoe; the position of them now in that sort that they finde them, is caused by him that so left them, either at all aduentures, or (as it may well be) on some speciall occasion otherwise, and yet is it casuall and a Lot to them.
               Or lastly to instance in one other sort of Lots more commonly vsed by children in game; when they play at Euen and od, or at Heads and points, either there is no such immediate prouidence, as these men dreame of; or if there be, it must be exercised not in disposing of any corporall motion of the insensible Creature (for the Lots are already disposed, be they stones or pins, by him that holdeth them) nor in directing the others hand in choosing, or in placing of his pin (for

                   he addeth withall, that no generall rule can be gathered for ordinarie Lots from it. But Augustine yet saith Zanchie,

                   saith that Predestination may be tearmed a Lot. True it is that Augustine indeed saith somewhat to that effect

                  in the same there is no choise but Gods will alone, and so our saluation dependeth on Gods free-fauour and good pleasure onely, not on mans merite. But that is but a tropicall or metaphoricall speech, comparing the freenesse of Gods choise to the indifferencie of a Lot, that hath no respect to any matter of mens worth or desert: and so no way concerneth the present businesse, neither is it of force to proue a Lot to be that that is figuratiuely compared thereunto.
               Againe it may be granted that a Lot cast by Gods speciall appointment for this end to discouer what person God hath assigned to some place, may in some sense (though very improperly) be tearmed Gods predestination, because it is a signe of it, or a meanes to discouer it, as

               I answere: The assumption is not true if it be vnderstood vniuersally: it concludeth nothing to the Question if it be taken particularly.
               The proofe annexed to it scarce carrieth good sense: the Printer, it may be, is in fault. But if the meaning of the Authour be, as I conceiue it, (for I must in part go by guesse) that the disposition of euery Lot is wholy attributed to, and the euent wholy expected from the speciall and immediate Prouidence of God; I deny it, neither doe the places produced proue it. The 
                     Prou. 16.33. former of them, concerning ordinary Lots or Lots in generall, was examined and answered sufficiently before.
               The 
                     Act. 1.24, 26. latter is an example of an extraordinary Lot, wherein there was indeed an immediate and speciall prouidence. But

                   extraordinary examples make no generall rules. Neither is it a good course of arguing to reason from the speciall, or a singular to the generall and vniuersall; much lesse from one extraordinarie act or euent to all ordinary courses of the same kinde. Herein is the difference between the one and the other, betweene the extraordinary

Lot, wherein there is an immediate hand of God for speciall purpose, and the ordinarie Lot, wherein there is not; that the one could not but fall certainly, were it neuer so oft cast, as in the Lots vsed for the discouery of

And thus much for the two first formes; which in effect are the same.
               § 6. Thus then they reasoned against a Lot in game as an abusing of Gods name and a playing with a worke of his immediate prouidence: Now further they charge it as a tempting of God in requiring of a speciall worke and immediate sentence from God for the deciding of vaine doubts: And first they argue on this manner:

                     
                        
                           Balmford. dialog. argum. 2. We are not to tempt the almightie by a vaine desire of manifestation of his power and speciall prouidence.
                     But by vsing Lots in sport we doe so: therefore wee may not vse Lots in sport.
                  
               
               The assumption they seeme to prooue on this wise.
               
                  
                     
                        Dan. de lud. al. c. 9. rat. 1. To call God to sit in iudgement where there is no necessitie so to doe, or for the determining of trifles, is to tempt, nay to mocke God:
                  But by the vse of Lots in sport God is called to sit

                     By the vse of Lots in sport therefore we tempt and dishonour God.
               
               The Proposition is confirmed à simili,

               Yea rather if a Lot be such as here they say, it is not to be vsed in any businesse at all vpon any occasion whatsoeuer. For, It is

                  not lawfull to tempt God

               The assumption is thus proued euidently 
                     Ex concessis.
                   by the former grounds and grants: 
                     Exod. 17.2.7. Psal. 78.18.19.20. 
                  To require a worke of Gods immediate power and prouidence in this or that kinde, is to stint, and so to tempt God: But to vse a Lot in any case, is to require a worke of Gods immediate power and prouidence: (for euery Lot, say they, is such:) Therefore to vse a Lot in any case whatsoeuer is vnlawfull.
               
               
                  But this Conclusion is vntrue: for 
                     Prou. 18.18. a Lot in some cases may lawfully be vsed: the former ground therefore is false.
               It is indeed

For to haue recourse to extraordinary meanes when ordinary faile, is to tempt God by refusing to depend and wait vpon God, as our Sauiour implieth, when 
                     Matth. 4.3, 4, 2. at the Deuils motion he refused to

                     Exod. 17.2.3. Psal. 78.41. the sinne of the Israelites sometime in the Wildernesse. No such Lot therefore at all as they allow of is allowable. And to speake as the truth is, by the course and force of this their discourse, the only lawfull vse of a Lot is disallowed and condemned, and an vnlawfull and vnwarrantable vse of it is allowed in the roome of it.
               §. 8. Secondly, an Oath and a Lot are not alike: the comparison therefore laid betweene them will not hold. For neither is the right of ought in an ordinary Lot put to the speciall prouidence or immediate and extraordinary worke of God; as 2. Cor. 11.31. Galat. 1.20. Phil. 1.8. the truth of the thing testified is in an oath put to his testimonie: neither is there in euery Lot any such solemne inuocation of God, as there is in an Oath euer either 2. Cor. 1.23. expressed or implied, by

which God is called to witnesse with vs the truth of that we auow, or the truth of our purpose to performe what we promise:1. Sam. 14.41. Act 1.24, 25, 26. as may hereby appeare.
               The definition of each thing containeth the whole nature or the thing defined. Now a Lot may be defined without this: but so cannot an Oath. Yea so

                     Leuit. 27.32. In assigning and setting out tithe, it was not lawfull, much lesse necessary, to pray God so to giue a right Lot, that euery Lambe or Kid that were indeed in course of time the tenth, might certainely or constantly so come to hand. But they prooue not that praier is part of a Lot or is in the Lot, as it is part of an oath, and is included in the Oath, as by the vsuall

                   definitions of an Oath may appeare. In election of offices

sacred or ciuill praier is vsed or at least ought to be vsed: yet it followeth not therefore that praier is a part of the choise, or that therefore the election in the nature of it doth necessarily suppose a speciall prouidence and determining presence of God. Yea praier may be vsed both before game and in game, as both before and at meate, and yet is not therefore of the nature of game, nor supposeth therefore a speciall prouidence of God and a determining presence in it.
               Lastly, a Lot is no religious act, nor holy thing of it selfe, as 
                     Chap 6. §. 6. before hath beene shewen: there is much difference therefore betweene Lots, and the word of God, Sacraments and Oathes. For these things are holy of themselues and in their owne nature, as the very definitions of them will soone shew: and therefore cannot but be holy. Whereas a Lot is not in the nature and the definition of it holy, and therefore is not alwaies and necessarily sacred. Yea those things are now holy, as euer, in our ordinary vse; whereas no Lot is holy that we can vse now adaies; nor indeed was euer any so, saue extraordinarily. But Gods taking of any thing sometime extraordinarily or from ordinarie vse to apply it to some holy and extraordinary vse, doth not exempt the kinde in generall, but the thing onely it selfe so vsed in speciall from ciuill or light and ordinarie vsage; and that also so long only as it is so set apart: As the vse of water in Baptisme hindreth not but that a man may play with water, yea and with that very water that may afterward be a Sacrament in Baptisme, or that hath so beene, but is not now. In

like manner when a Lot shall be extraordinarily vsed for a speciall signe of Gods immediate election and choise, whosoeuer shall then contemne or set light by that Lot, he shall abuse an holy thing and Gods name in so doing; but not whosoeuer shall vse otherwise any Lot to disport, yea though it were that Lot that had beene vsed in such a busines before; there remaining no more holinesse in it after that vse is ouer, then in 
                     Exod. 3.2.5. the bush that burnt but wasted not, when God manifested himselfe to Moses in it, after that manifestation was once ended.

                  But Lots are Gods Oracles. Lots therefore may not be vsed for recreation or in disport.
               
               The assumption is thus proued:

                  by them such doubtfull

things may be determined, as no wit or skill of man is otherwise able to decide. For what hidden truth can by any Lot be discouered? or what can be decided or determined by a Lot, that might not bee determined by any third party, yea by a childe or Idiote, as well as by a Lot, if it should please the parties contending to referre themselues thereunto?
               § 10. Secondly for the instances alleadged: To reason on this manner, Lots were once Gods Oracles in these and these cases: therefore they are so in all: or, Lots were sometime extraordinarily Gods Oracles in some cases whereunto they were by God then specially for that purpose assigned: therefore they are so alwayes: both the consequence is vnsound, and the consequent vntrue. For first it followeth not; If sometime extraordinarily, then euer. 
                  2. Sam. 5.24.25. The noise that Dauid heard ouer his head in the mulbery-trees was Gods Oracle to him: shall the like rustling, that wee may chaunce to heare in trees ouer our heads, be therefore a diuine Oracle to vs?1. Sa. 14.8, 9, 10. The Philistines speech to Ionathan and his Armour-bearer was as an Oracle of God to them: shall the like answere therefore be the same now to vs? or must it needes therefore bee euer such?
               Againe that Lots are not alwaies, nay not at all now Gods Oracles or any such diuine sentence, it is euident.
               For first 
                     Num. 23.19.20. 1. Sam. 15.29. Esai 14.27. Gods Oracles and sentences are certaine and constant: for

                   himselfe. And so were those Lots whereby God somtime gaue sentence, as that which Achan was discouered by, which had it therefore

either beene oft cast, or cast by diuers persons at Gods appointment at once, would still constantly haue

                        u. c. 1. there is nothing more vncertaine, ready vpon euery new shaking of the Lot pot to giue out a new sentence. For suppose we that some one Minister of a whole hundred in our head City should by Lot be selected to visite the Pesthouse, would the Lot drawne in this case As in the Tuscan Estate they draw fiue seuerall times, and so fiue seuerall persons for each office. See before chap 4 sect. 8. foure or fiue times together with neuer so great solemnity light certainely and constantly euer on the same man? Or suppose As in the Venetian Estate, foure seuerall companies cast Lots for the nomination of the same Offices. Ibid.
                   foure or fiue seuerall Companies in seuerall places should, after the busines solemnly by praier commended to God, cast Lots vpon the selfe-same imployment among the same parties, were it certaine, yea or probable that they should all light vpon the same person? Or were it not triuolous, if not impious, therefore to say, that vpon euery second shaking or drawing GOD altreth his sentence, and so to accuse him of inconstancie; or that to seuerall Companies he giueth a seuerall sentence, and so to charge him with contradiction and contrariety?
               Secondly 
                     Deut. 32.4. 2. Chron. 9.7. Ps 92.15. &amp; 111. 7.8. &amp; 19.8.9. Gods oracles are euer according to iustice and equitie: but the sentence of a Lot is not certainely such. For suppose a matter of right, wherein he that ought to yeeld will not yeelde, by mutuall consent therefore of necessity put to a Lot; dare any man say certainely that it shall go with him that hath right? Or in warre, suppose a whole troupe put to cast Lots for their lines, among whom there

are many that are no way at all faulty, dare any say that the Death-lot shall light on no one of these, but vpon those alone that indeed haue deserued to die? as 
                     I
                           •
                        sh 7.18.19. in Achans case a man might well confidently say, that it should surely light on him that was the delinquent and on no other, whom by such meanes God had then giuen warrant to search for. No:

               Thirdly, if a Lot were Gods sentence,

                   what need men be so curious in examining and trying the fitnesse or vnfitnesse of those that they admit to a Lot for the bearing of any Office either in Church or Common-weale?

                     Deus melius in huiusmodi indicat. Aug. ep. 180. God as well able to iudge of their fitnesse or vnfitnesse as man is? Or doe they distrust God, and feare that he will be partiall in his sentence, whose constant commendation is, that he is 
                     Deut. 10.17. 2 Chron. 197. Iob 34 19. Act. 10.34. Rom. 2.10. no respecter of persons? The generall care therefore in this kinde of all those that vse Lots in any such weightie affaire, sheweth euidently, that they doe not esteeme the Lots verdict Gods Oracle, but a sentence so vncertaine, so inconsiderate, so heedlesse, that it might well run with them into a whirle-poole drawing Church and State after it, if by humane

caution it were not the more warily managed. Was there any such feare, thinke wee, in the Lot that 1 Sam. 10.21. 
                  Samuel cast for a King; or any need of such caution to haue beene obserued in it?
               §. 11. Lastly, it a Lot were a diuine sentence,

                   learned mans instance, and that approued by him, of a Noble mans sonne) because hauing cast Lots for direction after inuocation of Gods name in that busines, the Lot had light vpon her. Much more idle yet were it for him to beare one downe, that she ought in conscience to haue him and no other but him, and that without guilt

of sinne and disobedience she might not refuse him, because God in a Lot cast by him had giuen such a sentence. And yet were a Lot Gods oracle, it should necessarily binde, not expecting mans priuity or consent thereunto: yea where it was Gods oracle, it did necessarily so binde, as 1. Sam. 10.22. in Sauls case nothing willing at the first, but enforced in some sort to condescend vnto that which the Lot imposed vpon him.
               Secondly by mutuall consent it is no question but that men may alter and change their Lots either with other, as

other to it so vnfit for it?
               Yea lastly in some case it were a sinne for a man to retaine that which by Lot is befalne him. For may a man with a good conscience keepe his brothers right from him, which the iniquitie of a Lot, for quietnesse sake yeelded to by the other, hath against iustice cast vpon him, and say it is Gods sentence? yea may not the wronged party lawfully endeauour, by conuincing him in conscience of the wrong that he hath done him, to recouer his right, if he can? Or as 
                     Act. 1.25.26. 
                  Matthias should haue sinned in renouncing his Apostleship; so did not

And yet by these mens positions should that Lot also be Gods sentence, and his choise thereby Gods immediate call to that office. A senslesse conceipt to suppose that any man should sinne by following Gods call, by doing after Gods sentence.

               To draw all to an head then and so to end with this argument, let any man endued with ordinarie reason iudge how a Lot can be said to be a sacred Oracle, and a diuine sentence, that neither absolutely tieth any man for matter of fact, nor doth certainely determine ought in question of right, that neuer speaketh certainely, and would oft speake vnaduisedly, if by humane caution it were not limited before what it should say.
               § 13. Now these were the arguments taken from the nature of Lots. The next argument is drawne from the proper vse and end of them. And herein they reason sometime from the affirmatiue, sometime from the negatiue.
               From the affirmatiue thus:

                     
                        Balmsor dialog. argum. 3.
                        Whatsoeuer God hath sanctified to a proper end, is not to be peruerted to a worse end Matth. 21.12, 13.
                        .
                     But God hath sanctified Lots to a proper end; viz. to end controuersies Num. 26.55. Trou. 18.18.
                        .
                     Therefore man is not to peruert them to a worse;

viz. to play, and by playing to get away another mens money, which without controuersie is his owne.
                  
               
               This argument thus conceiued is faultie two waies. For first it goeth from the question, which is not whether any Creature or ordinance of God may be peruerted, or peruersly vsed; but whether the vse of Lots questioned be a peruerting of them or no; whereas in the conclusion it is taken for granted that it is. Neither againe is the question whether men may vse Lots playing for money (a thing incident to other games as well as these; which whether it be lawfull or no, I shall not neede now to discusse.) much lesse, whether they may be vsed in game to that end, to get another mans money from him, or no; (which is no generall vse of them, nor hath any place at all there, where either there is no wagering at all, or where the Lot is vsed onely at the beginning of the game, to decide who shall ioyne, who lead, or the like:) but whether Lots may in any wise be vsed in sport.
               Secondly there is more inferred in the conclusion then was in the premisses, and that which followeth not from ought in them. For the vse of a Lot in play is euer to decide some question or controuersie, though a light one it is like, yet a question or controuersie truely so tearmed; otherwise it were no Lot.
               For the mending of these faults the argument may better be conceiued on this manner:

                     That which God hath sanctified to some proper vse, is not to be applied to any other, especially a worse vse.
                     But Their proper vse is to decide great controuersies Perkins gold. chaine, chap. 20. on precep. 3. God hath sanctified Lots to this proper vse,

to wit, the deciding of controuersies in matters of weight.
                     A Lot therefore may not be applied to any other vse, much lesse to a worse.
                  
               
               The Proposition is proued by 
                     Matth. 21.12, 13. ex Esai 56.7. &amp; I

                     Prou. 18.18. 
                  The Lot stinteth strife, and maketh partition among the mighty. For 
                     Num. 26.55. the other place is but an instance that a Lot once was by Gods owne appointment so vsed. It is amplified à simili,

                     Fenner of recreat. spec. rule 4. reas 1. to proue that Salomons purpose in those words before alledged is to shew the only lawfull vse of a Lot; (viz. to end controuersies which otherwise conueniently cannot, when each Contender without the Lot is too mightie to yeeld;) thus: 
                     Fennor ibid.
                   
                  As when the Apostle saith, 
                  
                     Hebr. 6.16. 
                  An Oath for confirmation among men is an end of all strife, his purpose is not so much to teach vs, that men vse an Oath to end controuersies; (which euery man knoweth,) but that God hath dedicated and made an Oath holy and sure onely for that vse of necessarie deciding of doubts of importance among men: so the like words vsed of a Lot must be vnderstood in the same sense▪ not so much to teach vs that a Lot ended such controuersies among men, which all know, but that God hath ordained it onely for that vse.
               
               § 14. For the fuller answere to this argument and the proofes of it, diuers distinctions, of some

good vse, would be obserued.
               First therefore the word, sanctifie, is diuersly taken. For, to omit all other acceptions; it is taken sometime in a larger sense; and so to sanctifie signifieth to assigne a creature to any speciall or singular vse whatsoeuer, either sacred or ciuill: thus are 
                     Esai 13.3. the Medians said by God to be sanctified for the subduing and sacking of Babel: and so are 1. Tim. 4.4. meates said to be sanctified by Gods word for mans foode; and 1. Cor. 7.14. the vnbeleeuing Mate sanctified to the maried beleeuer.
               
               Sometime againe it is taken in a stricter sense; and so to sanctifie signifieth to set apart a Creature beside his ordinary vse to some sacred and spirituall imployment: as where it is said, that 
                     Gen. 2.3. God sanctified the seuenth day of the world; and where 
                     Exod. 20.8. men are commanded to sanctifie the same: hee by precept enioyning that imployment of it; they by practise employing it according to his precept.
               Now in both these kindes may the Lord well be said sometime to sanctifie but not to appropriate; when by his ordinance hee either enioineth or granteth the vse of a Creature so in some kinde, as yet he restraineth not, nor inhibiteth the vse of it in any other kinde. Thus are the fruites of the earth so 
                     Gen. 1.29. 
                  sanctified for mans foode, as they are 
                     Esai 38.21. not yet restrained from phisicke: yea thus was the water that 
                     Num. 20.10.11. miraculously gushed out of the rocke so 1. Cor. 10.4. sanctified to a spirituall employment, as yet it was not denied vnto ciuill and prophane vses, euen 
                     Num. 
                     
                        •
                     0.8, 11. to the watering of brute beasts: sometime to sanctifie and to appropriate, when God sequestreth and seuereth

the Creature so sanctified vnto some one speciall or proper vse from all other vses else whatsoeuer.
               And thus he sanctifieth and appropriateth either the whole kinde of the Creature; as 
                     Exod. 30.31, 32, 33. that curious composition of pretious and holy ointment expresly inhibited to all other vses; or some particular onely of that kinde; as 
                     Exod. 30.23. the spices and odours ingredients of that holy ointment; as 
                     Exod. 30.26, 27, 28, 29. &amp; 29.44. the Tabernacle, 1. King. 8.10, 63, 64. &amp; 9.3. the Temple, and the appurtenances of either: and as those Elements of 
                     Matth. 3.11. Ephes. 5.25. 1. Cor. 6.11. water, 1. Cor. 10.16. bread and 
                     Matth. 26.27, 28, 29. wine that in the Sacraments are sanctified to bee signes and pledges of spirituall grace: and that againe, either so to continue during the date of that law, as in the vnguent before spoken of; or during the time onely of the speciall vse to those ends, as in the Elements last mentioned.
               To apply these distinctions then to the present argument: If they take the word sanctifie in the stricter sense, the Proposition is true, but the Assumption is vnsound: for Lots are not set apart, or said so to be in either of the 
                     Prou. 18.18. Num. 26.55. places produced to any holy or spirituall, but to a ciuill vse onely.
               If in the larger and more generall sense, then either they speake of things sanctified onely but not appropriated, or of things both sanctified and appropriated too, and that either the whole kinde in generall, or some of the kinde onely.
               If of things sanctified onely but not appropriated, the Proposition is not true; For 1. Cor. 11.23, to 28. bread and wine are sanctified to be seales of Gods couenant, and yet doth not that hinder 
                     Psal. 104.15. the lawfull vse of them otherwise: so was oyle sometime

                     Exod. 30.31, 32, 33. holy ointment inhibited to all other vses; and as it is in the 
                     Rom. 4.11. Exod. 12.11. Sacraments sequestred and set apart to certaine spirituall purposes onely, the Assumption is vnsound.
               If of the sanctification and appropriation not of the whole kinde, but of some particulars of the kind, the premisses might be granted, and yet nothing concluded against the vse of Lots in generall.
               If of the whole kinde, the Proposition is true, though the proofe be not so pertinent; but the Assumption is not sound.

                  § 15. But 
                     Hebr. 6.16. the Apostles speech of an Oath sheweth that Salomon meant so, when hee vsed the like speech of a Lot.
               It doth nothing lesse. For neither is it true that the Apostles scope was to shew that this is the onely end of an Oath, to stint strife and controuersie, neither is it so indeed.
               His purpose is not to shew it: for 
                     Hebr. 6.13, 16, 17, 18. it is onely to shew how sacred, firme and inuiolable an Oath is among men from man to man; (which he proueth by that which all men know and acknowledge) and how much more then from God to man, when 
                     I

                  A mans couenant or testament once ratified no man annulleth; much lesse can any annull or abrogate Gods.
               Neither is that the onely lawfull end of an Oath. For there be other ends of it; as, to giue assurance of the performance of couenants and promises. For what controuersie was there betweene Ionathan and Dauid to be ended by Oath, when 1. Sam. 20.16, 17, 42. they sware either to other? or what controuersie was there betweene GOD and Abraham, or Dauid and GOD; when 
                     Gen. 22.16, 17. Heb. 6.13, 14, 17, 18. 
                  God sware to Abraham, and

                  Dauid to God? or what controuersie is there to be ended by those Oathes, that men vsually take at entrance into office both in Church and Common-weale?
               The like may be said of that 
                     Prou. 18.18. other place of Salomon. The scope of the place is not to stint or restraine the vse of a Lot to the ending of strife, much lesse to the ending of great quarrels onely; or among men of might alone, though Salomon expresly

name such: For he speaketh of contentions in generall: And why may not a meane inheritance be diuided by Lot among meane men as well as a rich one among mighty men? or doe not contentions arise among mighty men many times about meane matters? But the scope of it is rather 
                     Vise Lauat. &amp; Bainū in Prou. 18. to perswade all sorts of men to compose their controuersies, be they great or small, rather by such a course so easie and so equall, then to plunge themselues by eager pursuite of Law suites into further inconueniences; and 
                     Cartwr. ibid.

                   such a thing is not expressed or reuealed in the word, therefore it is no matter of Faith, nor such as a man is necessarily bound to beleeue: but not to say, 
                     Scriptura multa dissimulat, multa tacitè praet-rit, &amp;c. Aug. de nat. &amp; grat. contr. Pelag. c. 37. &amp; 38. &amp; de mend. ad Consent. c. 10. such a thing is not mentioned or related in Scripture, therefore it was not done, or it neuer was: as for example, 
                     Gen. 4.17. 
                  Cain hath but one sonne mentioned by Moses, therefore hee had no more sonnes or children but him. Much lesse may a man reason 
                     A facto ad ius: à non fieri ad non licere.
                   from matter of Fact to matter of Right, as to say, such or such a thing wee neuer reade in the word to haue beene done, and therefore it may not be done. For how many things are there whereof there is no example in Gods word, and yet the vse of them is generally allowed as lawfull and good? Many things there are whereof no precedent of the vse of them but in some one kinde onely, which yet may be vsed also vnto others. No vse of butter recorded in the word but for foode onely: may it not therefore be vsed also for phisicke? Yea many things there are of ordinary vse, whereof there is no mention at all in Gods

word, which yet all generally allow: as sugar for sweetning, printing of bookes, shooting in guns, and the like, which all by this argument are vtterly condemned; or if they be iustified, then the grounds of it faile.
               Secondly an Action may haue 
                     Voluntas Dei dicitur praeceptio, prohibitio, consilium, permissio. Lomb. sent. l. 1. d. 45. G.
                   warrant sufficient by permission without precept or practise. For where God hath not limited the vse of any Creature or ordinance, there he hath left the vse of it free. Where he hath not determined the circumstances of any action, there what he hath not prohibited, that hath he permitted, and that is warrant sufficient for it. Where therefore circumstances are determined, the argument holdeth from the negatiue to make that vnwarrantable, that is not either expresly or by good consequence enioyned. But where they are not determined, the argument is strong enough from the negatiue to proue that warrantable that is not either expresly or by iust consequence prohibited.
               For this cause in the point of Gods worship the argument holdeth 
                     Ier 7.31. &amp; 19.5 Coloss 2.22, 23. from the negatiue for the substance of it, because 
                     Deut. 12.30, 31, 32. God hath determined it. But in ciuill affaires it will not hold from the negatiue to disallow ought; because God hath not so determined them. Else what warrant is there for bowls, for tennis, for foot-ball, for chesse &amp;c. which yet no man disalloweth? Let one example serue for all to shew the weaknesse of this kinde of arguing. There is neither precept, nor practise (1. Sam. 14.31, to 35. at least allowed or allowable) of eating Bloud in Scripture: therefore a man may not eate a blacke pudding. In which conclusion

I assure my selfe these Authours will not accord with the Familists and new Sectaries. And yet may they say more against the one, then these can any of them against the other. For the one is found expresly forbidden both in the old and new Testament both

               § 18. Thus haue wee gone through the maine and most forcible Arguments that are produced against lusorious Lots. For these arguments onely that are drawne from the nature of Lots, or the proper end and vse of them, are those that fight against the generall vse of Lots in disport: the re
                     •
                  t concerne the vse of them but in some sorts o
                     •
                   game; and therfore though they were all granted, yet were nothing concluded against the maine point propounded, to wit, that the vse of a Lot in disport or pastime is not simply euill in it selfe. Yet it shall not be amisse to heare what the rest say.
               The next argument therefore, and of the principall the last and the least is taken from the other Tearme in the point questioned, to wit, recreation or game, and the right vse and end of it.
               The argument thus standeth.
               
                  That is no lawfull matter of sport and pastime, wherein the end and scope of sport is not or cannot be had▪
                  
                  
                     But in games of Lotery the end and scope of pastime cannot be had.
                  Lotery therefore is no lawfull matter of sport and pastime.
               
               The Assumption is thus strengthened:

                              ud. alea c. 9. rat. 2. The end and scope of play is thereby to exercise either the ability of the body or the industrie of the minde.
                     But in games of Loterie is neither of these exercised: not the minde; because there is no vse of Arte or skill, but all is put to hazard: Not the body; for men sit at them without stirring ought saue fingers and hands onely.
                     In games of Loterie therefore the end and scope of game is not had.
                  
               
               In this Argument there are two things to be chiefly obserued; and two Axiomes that the answere is principally to be applied vnto.
               First, that it toucheth and concerneth onely such games as consist of and depend vpon meere casualtie onely: (not those that are mixt of chaunce and arte, wherein

               Secondly, that the end and scope of recreation is not rightly assigned: which is principally, as the very name of it implieth, to

                     . Recreation therefore and Exercise are two distinct things; And howsoeuer a man may recreate himselfe by some exercise, as

                         Martial epig. l 13. he may also by some kinde of study: yet no more is exercise therefore recreation, then recreation is studie. Yea the same exercise may be recreation to one man that is not so to another: as when a man by the Physitians aduice draweth a bow in his chamber, which he taketh no pleasure in, nor doth for or with delight, it is an exercise onely; but no pastime, as to him that shooteth abroad vpon pleasure. So when two ride together in hunting, the one onely to exercise his body by riding, or to accompanie or attend the other, not regarding the
game; the other meerely or mainely for the game and the sport; it is an exercise onely, or an office, or seruice in the one, a recreation to the other.
               The end and scope then of an action is one thing; the meanes, whereby this end and scope is effected and attained, is another thing. The end and scope of recreation is the refreshing of the body or mind, and the delight of either. The meanes whereby this is effected are diuers: For

                   this may be and is vsually effected by games consisting meerely or mixtly of Lots, as well as by other, with those that take delight in them. Neither is it a thing simply euill or disallowable to take delight in the casuall and vncertaine or unexpected euent of a thing, (that which maketh iests and witty speeches many times the more pleasant, in regard that 
                     Iocus ab inexpectato. Vise Cicer. de orat. l. 2. the answere is other in them then was expected) as being a matter light and friuolous; since of recreations it is not required that they be serious.
            
            
               CHAP. VIII. Answere to the Arguments lesse principall against lusorious Lots.
               § 1. THus then wee haue dispatched all the principall Arguments, that tend directly to proue Lusorious Lots simply vnlawfull, and so euill in themselues. Wee proceed now to the lesse principall, that tend to proue them inconuenient and inexpedient; or such as haue beene generally disallowed and condemned by the most.
               These Arguments therefore may be ranked in two rowes: The former sort of them are such as are drawne from the euils and inconueniencies that necessarily

or ordinarily attend these lusorious Lots, and the games that consist of them.
               The euils that they are charged with are referred to foure heads:
               
                  1. Cursing, banning and blaspheming:
                  2. Losse of time, and decay of health:
                  3. Vnlawfull gaine, or desire of gaine:
                  4. And lastly, wasting of wealth.
               
               From the first of these they thus reason:

                     That which causeth most horrible cursing, banning, and blaspheming, is not to be endured: 
                           Dan. de lud. alea c. 9. rat. 7. Dice-play so doth; Therefore not to be endured.
                  
               
               I answer: Lot games, mixt especially (but those this Author impugneth not) doe no more cause these things then Boules, or Chesse, or other like, which many take occasion by of the like outrages.
               Secondly, it is not so much the game it selfe ordinarily in either▪ that maketh men thus ouershoot themselues, as 
                     Iustinian. Cod. lib 3. tit 43.

                     . Et Dan. ipse vbi sup. &amp; Calu. in Epist. ad N.N script.
                   the wasting of their wealth, and losse of money at or by either: which being seuered from the game it selfe, it will neither cause it with the well-disposed otherwise, nor would ordinarily occasion it with others.
               These euils therefore (as the rest that follow) arising not from the nature of the game, but either from the immoderate and inordinate vse or rather abuse of it, or from the euill and impious disposition of the gamster otherwise, make it vnlawfull onely to those that so vse it, or are so affected at it, but not simply in it selfe, nor to those that shall vse it with due Caution in that kinde.
               Yea but these Lot-plaies, saith one, doe necessarily

draw or at least tempt the very best to horrible blaspheming and prophaning of Gods name: and are therefore thus specially charged afresh.
               
                  To say, what lucke is this, how crooked? is an horrible blaspheming of Gods name:
                  But 
                        Pennor of recreat. spec. rule 4. reas. 3. Lot-games necessarily draw or tempt the best so to say:
                  Therefore they necessarily draw or tempt the best to horrible blasphemie.
               
               The Proposition is thus proued:

                     
                        
                           Ibid.
                         To say, What a God, what peruers and crooked Prouidence of God? is horrible blasphemie.
                     But to say, what lucke, how crooked, is in plaine words to say so:
                     Therefore to say, what lucke, how crooked? is horrible blasphemie.
                  
               
               The Assumption is proued; because in Lot-games there is nothing that can be accused (as in other games infirmitie or want of skill may) but Gods immediate direction, vnlesse we will brutishly giue Gods glory to Fortune.
               
               To answere hereunto directly and briefly. Neither doe Lot-games necessarily tempt the best to say so; neither is it blasphemie so to say. There is great difference betweene those two speeches rightly conceiued, and as they may be and are of good Christians ordinarily vsed: yea they are nothing alike indeed.
               There is somewhat else beside God and his prouidence, as in all other casuall euents, so in Lots, that such speeches may be applied vnto. I am enforced too oft (I confesse) to repeate what was

                  aide downe 
                     Cap. 2 §. 3.4. at first, (while I tread the maze of sundry mens fancies;) that in casuall euents there are two distinct things, the worke of the Creator and the act of the Creature: the latter whereof may such speeches be well applied vnto, and so haue no tang or taint at all of impiety or blasphemie. They build all vpon this wrong ground, that there is a meere and immediate prouidence of God in all Lots, which is not true, as hath 
                     Cap. 2 §. 5. formerly beene proued, you may conceiue it by examples of like casualtie in other cases: To passe by actions of contingency caried by mans will and fore-cast oft crossing vs in our lawfull and warrantable courses, (as 2. Sam. 16.21, 22 cum 12.11, 12. in Dauids despitefull wrong done him in the abuse of his Concubines by his owne sonne Absolome,) wherein we vse such like tearmes without any impeachment of or disparagement to the diuine prouidence, which yet extendeth it selfe euen vnto those actions: Suppose a man riding on the way through the Forest, where a Deere rushing suddainly out of the couert maketh his Horse start and throw him: in this case for a man to say, what lucke was this? or, what a crosse accident was this? is no blasphemie, nor any accusing of Gods prouidence, but a complaining of the Creatures act and the euent of it. Yea for any man to censure such a speech as blasphemous, or to construe it as if he should say, What a God is this? or, what a crosse and crooked prouidence of God? were to make himselfe one of 
                     Iam. 3.

                     . those Masters, whom the Apostle Iames reproueth: the rather for that he chargeth that with blasphemie, wherein he cannot shew the least point of impiety.
               
                  For that of Fortune; if indeed by Fortune wee vnderstand such a blinde Deity, as the fabulous Poets fained, and idolatrous Infidels adored; it is idle and impious for any man to ascribe ought thereunto. But if by it we vnderstand the casuall and vncertaine motion of the Creature, whereby something beside the scope thereof is further effected; so we haue 
                     Cap. 2 §. 1. heard that 
                     Eccles. 2.14, 15. &amp; 3.19 &amp; 9.2, 3. Ruth 2.3. the holy Ghost vseth the tearme, and 
                     Luk. 10.31, 32. our Sauiour himselfe ascribeth the Preists lighting vpon the Passenger that lay wounded on the way thereunto; By chaunce, or, by fortune (for the words are all one) a Preist came downe that way, and likewise a Leuite.
               
               For the difference and dissimilitude of games, it is great indeed: but as there are other things that a man may as
                     •••
                  be the cause of his losse vnto in other games b
                     •••
                  e Gods prouidence, which yet swaieth also in them: so is there somewhat else here, to wit, the casuall motion, and various disposition of the Creature, a thing in it selfe and of it selfe distinct from Gods prouidence, as we formerly shewed.
               § 2. The second euill attending on or accompanying these Lot-games is losse of time, and decay of health by long sitting at them. The summe of the Argument which the Author cutteth into twaine, but may well be reduced to one, is this:
               
                  That which causeth losse of time, which might much better be spent, is vnlawfull: So

                  doth hazard in play: Its therefore vnlawfull.
               
               The Proposition is confirmed by the 
                     Ephes. 5.16. Col. 4.5. Apostles authoritie, who willeth Christian men to redeeme the time, 
                  
                     Dan. vbi sup.
                   that is, to spend their spare time in honest and

profitable employments, as in reading on Gods word, visiting the sicke, their friends, and such like.
               
               The Assumption is proued by the nature of this kinde of disport thus:
               
                  That which neither wearieth the body, nor cutteth of hope of conquest in time and by continuance, that recreation causeth losse of time:
               
               
                  But

                  this kinde of disport neither wearieth the body: for there is no exercise at all in it: nor cutteth off hope of conquest in time and by continuance; because it dependeth wholy vpon hazard, wherein the weakest and simplest may

                  hope, after neuer so long continued losse, at length to conquer and recouer, the dice changing their course, which they may as well doe as otherwise: and those that haue won, hope well to haue still the same luck, that before they had.
               
               
                  This kinde of game therefore causeth 
                        〈◊〉
                      losse of time, hauing no stint or end in it: which other games of necessitie must needes haue, either the body being ouer-wearied, or the weaker side for want of skill past hope of winning.
               
               This might haue done well for a Caution; it doth scarce well for an Argument. For first, for the proposition of the former Syllogisme, if it be vnderstood without limitation, that time ought to be spent alwaies in the best duties simply, it will ouer-throw all kinde of disport whatsoeuer. For it fighteth equally against all, be it of hazard meere or mixt, or of exercise of bodily strength or wit. But that is not sound; neither is it the Apostles meaning or purpose in that place to cut of all kinde of recreation, which Gods word giueth good warrant for; but to

cut off that idle and vaine trifling out and mispending of time needlesly, not onely by recreations, but by other worldly occasions,

               These, I say, I might well passe by, as well the one as the other; partly because in effect they bring no new matter; and partly because these euills are equally common to all games, and doe not so much concerne the nature of this kinde of play, as containe generall abuses of all kinde, though applied more specially to these: they are the faults of the Gamsters not of the games: and as one saith well of Lots writing of this argument of Lotery; so say I of game, and of Lots vsed in game,

               Besides that the scope of these Authors both the one and the other (in regard whereof I may well say that they are not so sincerely cited, but forced to say what indeed they doe not) is to condemne onely the games so vsed or rather so abused as too too commonly they are; not to quarrell with the light and lusorious vse of a Lot, nor to passe a

peremptory sentence against the vse of all such games in generall, which

                  The Lord forbiddeth 
                  1. Thess. 5.22. 
                  all appearance of euill; and all occasions of euill.
               
               True it is;

                     2. the Commandements that forbid any sinne, forbid those things also that may be occasions of that sinne. But they inhibit not generally the vse of all things to all, that any doth or may take occasion of euill by. They forbid them to those to whom they are that way dangerous, not to those that may and doe vse them without danger in that kinde.
               And no lesse true is it, that Christian men ought to 1. Thess. 5.22.

as I take it, that precept extendeth not. But how the vse of any Lot at all in game, or the vse of a Lot simply in this kinde of game, should be brought within compasse of either of these two branches, I see not; especially being so vsed as it is or may bee vsed of those that are godly and religiously disposed, and with such Cautions as 
                     Chap. 9. hereafter shall be giuen.
               § 5. After these arguments fetched from the Euills and inconueniences pretended necessarily or vsually to accompany these games, commeth the last maine argument taken from humane testimonies publike and priuate, of such as haue either in iudgement condemned, or by authoritis inhibited these kinde of games. I will endeauour to bring their arguments into some forme that wee may the better iudge of them.
               First therefore they seeme to reason on this manner:

                        That which is forbidden both by the ciuill Magistrate and the spirituall Gouernour, cannot be vsed without offence: But Lot-games are forbidden by both:
                     
                     
                        Therefore they cannot be vsed without offence.

For the Proposition of this argument and the conclusion following from it; as it is conceiued, it commeth not neere home to the maine point in question: If it be conceiued as it should, that whatsoeuer is forbidden by the ciuill or canon Law is euill simply in it selfe, it is not true; a thing confessed by

                   some before alleadged in this very particular wee now deale in. Humane lawes restraine the common vse of things indifferent; which things notwithstanding

cease not to be indifferent in themselues and in their owne nature: and so make them vnlawfull so far forth as they binde, and no further. But the maine question here is, not whether the vse of a Lot in game be prohibited by mans law, but whether it be inhibited by Gods law or no. For many things are lawfull by Gods law, that are not lawfull by mans law: as to transport such and such commodities without speciall licence, to trade and trafficke into such and such foraine parts, to eate flesh at certaine times, to bring some sorts of fish into the market for sale, and the like, which things yet are not euill simply, or in themselues.
               Yea take the Proposition as it is propounded, that Whatsoeuer is by humane Lawes forbidden, cannot be done without offence; and it is not all out true neither. For how many cases are there wherein the Summists and Casuists both Ciuilians and Canonists with the Schoole-men agre

In some case therefore may that be done without iust cause of scandale, the doing whereof is by humane Lawes inhibited. Neither suppose I is there any man so extreamely censorious, that because flesh on Fridaies is forbidden with vs by law, he will in that regard hold a man guiltie of sinne, for euery bit of flesh, that being in company with others, or hauing it readier at hand when hee is hungrie, he shall put into his mouth, especially not doing it of any contempt, and being one that is regardfull of the end of that Law otherwise.

                     Martyr. ad Iudic. c. 14. 
                  A man, well saith one of them, is not to be condemned, if being weakely or euill at ease he recreate himselfe by playing at Hazard, so he hazard not his monies: for it is especially to be obserued, what the scope was of those lawes, that

forbad such kinde of games: now that was that men should not wast their estates: to which purpose it is enacted, that no man hazard aboue a shilling: this was the scope and drift of the Law, to prouide that monies might not be mispent. Which if they be not, then the Law is not broken.
               §. 8. For the Lawes of our Land how vnfitly they are alleadged to the present purpose, to wit, See Babington on Command. 8. to proue dice to bee euill and vtterly to bee condemned, yea or generally prohibited, Cards and Tables being notwithstanding allowed and approued; may appeare by a particular surueigh both of the Lawes to that end cited, as also of others that haue since in later times beene enacted.
               The 12. Rich. 2. ca. 6 first Law wherein dice are said to be generally forbidden, enacteth onely that All seruants of husbandrie, labourers, seruants of any artificer or victualer shall haue bow and arrowes, and vse the same on Sundaies and Holidaies; and shall leaue all playing at Tennis, foot-ball, quoites, dice, casting of the stone, kailes, and other such importune games. The 11. Hen. 4. cap. 4. next Act imposing a penalty of 6. daies imprisonment vpon all offendors against the former. The 17. Edw. 4. ca. 3 third of them discouereth the maine scope of these acts, namely, to bring in a more frequent vse of the bow, because the defence of the Land was much then by Archers: and withall giueth diuers other grounds of the former prohibitions then reuiued and renued, to wit, sundry vnlawfull games as closh, kailes, boules, qeckbord &amp;c. newly inuented, gaming houses erected and so commonly imploied; Gamesters thereby impouerished; murthers and roberies occasioned &amp;c. Whereupon

it enacteth further a penalty of twenty poundes and three yeares imprisonment against euery one that shall keepe, and of ten pounds and two yeeres imprisonment against euery one that shall haunt, any such house. The 11. Henr. 7. ca. 2. fourth commaundeth that no seruant or labourer play at tables saue for meate and drinke: nor at any other vnlawfull game saue at Christmas, and then in his Masters dwelling house onely: euery one so offending to be set in the stockes, and he that suffereth it in his house to forfeit a noble at least. To which, though not alleadged, may be annexed 19. Hen. 7. ca. 12. another Act of little later date, forbidding the same persons to play at tables, tennis, closh, dice &amp;c. saue as aboue, with the same penalties vpon persons therein delinquent imposed.
               And these are all, yea more then all, the lawes that are particularly cited. But because wee are referred to another work for more matter in this kind;See more in Pultons Abridgement. Babington on Command. 
                        •
                     . let vs see also what later Lawes haue enacted concerning such games, if we shall not tire out our Reader with proofes so impertinent.
               The later lawes therefore 33. Henr. 8. ca. 9. reuiued 2. &amp; 3. Phil. &amp; Mar. ca. 9. forbid keeping any common house, alley, or place of bouling, coiting, closh, cailes, tennis, dieing, tables, or carding for gaine, lucre and liuing, and haunting places so kept, without speciall placard expressing what games, and what persons to vse the same: As also priuate playing at tennis, tables, dice, cards, boules, closh, coiting or logeting by any artificer, husbandman, labourer, apprentice, iourneyman, seruingman &amp;c. out of Christmas, and then also any where saue in his Masters house and presence: And further, playing at boules by any man at any time in open places

out of his garden or Orchard; seuerall pecuniary mulcts imposed vpon the former offences: yet allowing any seruant to play at cards, dice or tables with his Master, or any Gentleman repairing to his house openly in his house and in his presence; and permitting any Nobleman or Gentleman of a hundreth pound lands per annum to licence his seruants at his discretion to play at cards, dice, tables, boules or tennis within his house, garden or orchard, either among themselues, or with others repairing to them: 
                  5. Edw. 6. cap. 25. 
                  Victuallers to put in recognisance not to suffer such games in their houses: And lastly 22. Henr. 8. c 12. reuiued 35. Elisab. cap. 7. 
                  all wandring persons vsing vnlawfull games to be punished as Rogues and Vagabonds.
               
               By this particular recitall of the seuerall Lawes that either haue beene or might further haue beene alleadged in this argument, may to any dim eye at the first view plainely appeare, that the Lawes of our Land rather iustifie and approue then condemnne the games questioned.
               For first they forbid indeed some vse of them, but withall they forbid as well bouling and coiting and tennis, and logetting, and throwing the stone: some exercises of arte and skill, some of industrie and actiuitie, or of dexteritie and agilitie; yea bouling more strictly and more generally then either carding or dicing; which yet no man that I know doth thereupon condemne or conclude to be vnlawfull.
               Againe though they forbid them to be vsed by some persons in some places at some times; yet they allow them to other persons, and those of the best note; as also to the same persons in other places at other times. See Dalions Iustice of Peace, title Of games vnlawfull. Whereby it appeareth euidently that

they restraine the vse of the games onely, but condemne them not as simply euill in themselues; yea rather that they approue them, in that they appropriate the common and ordinary vse of them to great personages; vnlesse we will say that

               The end and scope of the Law is partly to reforme abuses about these games, as mispending of time and coine in common gaming houses or elsewhere; and partly to bring into vse an other kinde of exercise in the roome of them,

                   which such varietie of games made the more to be neglected; to wit, shooting in the long bow, a matter of much vse, and of great weight then in war.
               Now for mine owne part so far am I from misliking these lawes, that, considering the great and generall abuse of the games by them prohibited, committed by such as both wast their pretiousest time, and throw away their wealth and thrift together at these exercises and the like; I wish rather that both the lawes were yet seuerer then they are, and that those that are, were better put in execution then for the most part they be.
               For the French States and Synodes with their Canons and Constitutions, hauing not seene them, I can say nothing but this to them; that if they haue vtterly abandoned the vse of those games among them; (which I doubt much of) yet neither doth that proue euery lusorious Lo

               § 10. I passe to the next argument much of the same nature with the former:
               
                  That which hath beene generally both by Christians and Heathen condemned as euill, cannot to Christian men be lawfull:
               
               
                  But dicing hath by both beene generally condemned.
               
               
                  It cannot therefore be lawfull to Christians.
               
               The answere to this argument (to omit that it commeth not home to the maine question concerning the generall vse of Lots in disport, which though all here said were granted, still standeth) must consist in a surueigh of the particular allegations, that for proofe of the assumption are produced.Of all men by generall consent as it were this vile game as most vile is detected &amp; detested: Heathē euer hated it; Christians euer abhorred it.

                  a certaine learned man after long study inuented the game of dicing by the instinct of the Deuill: and that thereupon he caused his owne picture to be drawne with the dicing tables as his inuention in his armes (for as for Cards

or any image painted on them there is no one word in the booke) to be adored by the Gamesters at the beginning of their game. Whereupon he tearmeth

               § 16. In the last place are Poets produced for the condemning of dice. And Poets indeed, Satyrists especially, are the common scourges of the vices and abuses of their times. Neither is it my purpose to be either a Pandar to any sinne, or a Proctor to pleade for it, to excuse or extenuate, much lesse to iustifie or acquit any abuse vsed in game: (let my tongue first cleaue to the roofe of my mouth, nay let it rather rot to the very roote in my mouth, then that I should once attempt ought in that kinde;) but to consider onely of these games pared from such abuses, as men may, if they will, and I doubt not but many doe, vse them. But let vs heare what these Poets say.

               To conclude for this argument, I condemne willingly as much as any of the Authors produced do: But no one of them all condemne that which they doe that alleadge them, and therefore they nothing at all concerne that for which they alleadge them.
               Yea to retort the argument applied to the present purpose. Were this probleme propounded, not whether it were lawfull for men to vse dice; but whether it were not as lawfull for children to play at euen and od, as at chery-pit, or at heads and points as at Push-pin, or at crosse and pile as at Spain-counter; I suppose there is none of the Authors formerly alleadged either Heathen or Christian, but would iudge it to be a question moued onely in iest, and scarce worthy to be answered in good earnest. And yet is it not made a question onely whether such childrens sports be lawfull, but it is put out of question that they are vtterly vnlawfull, by those that condemne simply all lusorie Lots, whom we deale with principally in this point. Who had therefore need to see to it, that the grounds be good and sure which they build vpon in condemning of that

which scarce any Heathen or Christian euer made scruple of before them.

                  This difference among the learned cannot but make men doubt, and

                  to vse them doubtingly is a sinne.
               
               I answere: first, this consequence simply and generally granted will inferre greiuous inconueniences, and driue men into strange straights. For if a man may doe nothing about which there is any difference among the learned, how many matters will be vtterly cast and cut off, which yet no man now condemneth other for the doing, being of the same minde and iudgement with himselfe? yea what a troupe of dilemmaes shall men continually be encountred

and entangled withall, wherein they shall be at a stand, able to take neither part, when yet they must needes be on some side, some holding it a sinne to doe a thing, others a sinne not to doe the same, as it falleth out in diuers controuersies both betweene the Separatists and our Ministers, and betweene our owne Ministers among themselues.
               Secondly, difference among the learned is not generally iust cause of doubt: in two cases especially it is not; First, where a man discouereth euidently the weaknesse of their grounds that defend the aduers part.
               Secondly, where a man findeth sure ground for the one side, which hee therefore sticketh close vnto.
               How many maine points are there in the body of Diuinity, which yet many, no doubt, yea the most among vs, now doubt not of, notwithstanding they finde differences among the learned about them? What

                   betweene Luther and Zwinglius many learned and religious taking part on either side, and continuing the controuersie euen to these times? Cannot a man therefore without wauering, euen a plaine ordinary Christian, adioyne himselfe to either side? yes; doubtlesse hee may, and many questionlesse doe. Difference therefore among the learned giueth good cause of disquisition and discussion, not necessarily iust cause of doubt.

to enforme himselfe aright, and resting ready to yeeld vnto any better information. Which morall certaintie, yea and more then it, I see not why it may not be well had in the present point concerning the vse of a lusorious Lot, notwithstanding the difference among those that be both learned and religious. For the ground whereof (to returne that that here is obiected) let thus much alone for the present be considered: that as

               CHAP. VIII. Of Cautions to be obserued in the vse of lusorious Lots.
               § 1. THus hauing answered the arguments produced by the learned of contrarie iudgement against these lusorious Lots, and proued the vse of them to be in it selfe not vnwarrantable: It shal not be amisse, as we did before in the former, so to annex here some caueats and cautions to be obserued in the vse of them, both applying some of the former to this particular; and beside adding some others, that may meete with such abuses, as to such kinde of Lots may be incident; that so things not vnlawfull in the right and warrantable vse of them, may not become vnlawfull to vs by our abuse of them.
               Lusorious Lots therefore, as all other recreations, are to be vsed soberly, seasonably, ingenuously, inoftensiuely, prudently, and religiously.
               First, I say, soberly and moderately, and to this purpose  1. Thess. 5.6. 1. Pet. 4.7. 2 Tim. 1.7. Tit. 2.6.12. the holy Ghost hath commended vnto vs Christian sobrietle and temperance as a principall virtue, yea as

               And againe the poorer sort, on the other side, though they complaine of penury, yet will not be beaten from play: euen those that will pretend want, to shift of the least common charge, yet will make shift to get somewhat wherewith to hold game: who when they haue spent what they had that way, wanting meanes to recouer ought soone or sodainely againe, and being enured to idlenesse by such thriftlesse haunts, are enforced ost to betake themselues afterward to such courses, as bring vpon them at length as well losse of life as of liuing.

Neither indeed can I discerne ought that should make it vnlawfull for a couple of familiar friends to put it to the euent of a game, whether of them shall part with such a trifle to the other, as either of them may spend lawfully at that present vpon his pleasure, or they might otherwise wel freely bestow either on other.
               Others therefore allow it, as the Ciuill law doth, in some cases 
                     Quod in conuiuio vescendi causa ponitur, in tam rē familiam ludere permittitur. C. lib. 3. tit. 43. leg. 3. for somewhat presently to be expended and spent in common betweene them, as when men play together for the charge of a supper. Yet may men go too far also that way; as in feasting of friends (a fault in these times too vsuall) a man may exceede. It is said of Nabal the Churle that 1. Sam. 26.36. 
                  he made a feast like a King. And as 
                     Prou. 23.20, 21. by feasting a rich man may soone bring himselfe to pouerty, and a poore man to beggerie: so may either do the same, which some seeme to haue obserued, by hazarding ouermuch to be spent and wasted that way.
               For mine owne part, I approue the iudgement of

                  It were better for a man (in such manner) on the Sabbath to plough then to play, and to dig and delue then to daunce all day. For the lighter the occasion of sinning is, where all other things are equall, the greater the sinne is.
               Yea and those also that on other daies wast that time this way, which they ought to spend either in their owne priuate and personall deuotions, or in instruction of their families and performance of holy duties with them, are not herein to be iustified no more then the former: the one turneth it to sinne as well as the other, in neglecting of that duty for the following of their owne pleasure, that 
                     Deut. 6.7. Ephes. 6.4. God himselfe hath enioyned them, and will one day require of them.
               So that the rule is here, that That time alone may be spent in play, which wee haue free from other, serious and religious, affaires.
               
               § 5. Thirdly, recreation must be vsed ingenuously, freely and liberally:

                   not with any greedy desire of lucre and gaine. For recreation is no trade or course of life, for a man to make a liuing of or to liue by: As 
                     Ludendo non ludere sed perdere. Cod. lib. 3. tit. 43. it is not playing, but spending when men wast themselues that way: so

               But it is not lawfull at all then, may some say, for a man to receiue any gaine, or liue in any wise by Game?
               I answer in some kind, and in some case it may, and that either ordinarily or extraordinarily.
               Ordinarily those may be said to liue lawfully by Game, whose trades &amp; professions are imployed in whole or in part in making, prouiding, selling, &amp; vttering such instruments or other furniture as are vsed commonly in Game, as Bowyers, and Fletchers, and Turners, and Dice-caruers, and Card-makers, and Haberdashers of small wares: For if the games themselues be lawfull,

               Extraordinarily a man may sometime also by the Game it selfe receiue gaine; as thus: Suppose a man of good wealth either being euill at ease or otherwise desirous to recreate himselfe, calleth in a poore man from his trade or his worke that he is otherwise imployed in, to accompanie him in his game, which he cannot vse without companie; it

is not vnlawfull for the poore man so accompanying the rich, to receiue some gaine from him, as a reward of his imployment with him, and in liew of that losse, which he sustaineth by intermitting of his owne worke. But among equals, or others ordinarily, that play togither for mutuall recreation and delight, for the one to enrich, or to desire to enrich himselfe by the others damage and losse,

               Now the offence that may be giuen by game is either generall or speciall; publike or priuate; in regard of our superiours or in regard of our equals.

               As also of those that liue vnder the ministery of such Pastors as are of a contrarie iudgement in this point: the Apostle requiring Christian men not to 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Hebr. 13.17. 
                  obey them onely, but to yeeld vnto them that haue the ouer sight of them, and that watch ouer them for their soules safetie; that is, not onely to be ruled by them for necessarie duties, and such as they shall be able to conuince them of by the euidence of Gods word; but to be ouer ruled also by them in matters of indifferencie, when they shall deeme somewhat

vnlawfull that may well be forborne, though either the grounds of such iudgement of theirs be insufficient, or their people be not throughly conuinced of the same.
               Neither ought children or seruants to take liberty to themselues for the vse of such games, as their parents or masters vnder whose gouernment they are, shall thinke good to restraine and to inhibite in their houses; where the Law both of 
                     Ephes. 6.1, 5. Colos. 3.20, 22. God and man hath giuen them a power of commaund: the breach whereof therefore may cause guilt of sinne euen in Gods sight.
               So that the rule here is, that Men be content to bee restrained in matter of game for the ordinarie vse of it, by the Church and State they liue in, by the Pastor they liue vnder, or by the Master they serue with.
               
               Now as offence may be giuen publikely or generally to those, that we liue vnder or among, so may offence be giuen also to those, that wee conuerse with in priuate. For which cause therefore are these games to be forborne in some cases in regard of our brethren, that either making scruple and doubt of them, or being perswaded in iudgement of the vnlawfulnesse of them, may there-through either offend with vs, or be offended at vs. For 
                     Fennor of recreat rule gen. 4. &amp; spec. 3. that is not indifferent, that is done with offence: since 1. Cor. 10.32, 33. 
                  wee ought not vnnecessarily to giue offence vnto any; but 
                     Rom. 15.1, 2. to seeke to please others as well as our selues, and that now and then euen 1. Cor. 10.33. 
                  with displeasing of our selues; doing that therein for them, that 
                     Rom. 15.3. 
                  Christ once did for vs. And therefore, 
                     Rom. 14 21. 
                  it is not good, saith the Apostle, to eate flesh or drinke wine, or to do ought whereby

thy brother may stumble, or be offended, or be weakned. And vndoubtedly, if 
                     R

                  it be euill for a man, when he eateth with offence; then it is no lesse euill to him, when he gameth with offence.
               Now in this kinde we may offend two waies.
               First when we cause others to sinne, and so to offend with vs, not by partaking with vs in sinne, but by partaking with vs in that, which though it be no sinne in it selfe, yet 
                     Rom. 14 22, 23 is it a sinne vnto them, because they hold it to be such. For 
                     Rom. 14.14. 
                  to him that holdeth a thing to be vncleane, to him it is vncleane; and him therefore 1. Cor. 8.7. it de
                     •
                  ileth in the doing of it or dealing with it. 1. Cor. 8.9, 10, 11, 12. Whereas then by thy practise thou encouragest such an one to doe the like to that thou doest, as is vnresolued in the point, thou laiest a stumbling blocke before him, who either 
                     Leuit. 19.14. Deut 27.8. for dimnesse of sight discerneth it not, or 
                     Heb. 12.12, 13. for weaknes of limme auoideth it not, and so by occasion of thy default stumbleth and falleth.
               Secondly when we cause others to be offended at vs, and to thinke euill of vs, as being such as make no conscience of our courses; because we vse that which they supposing to be sinne, suppose withall that we cannot but see to be sinne. For

                   it is the common guise of most men to thinke that euery one should see presently what themselues once apprehend. To giue offence therefore in this case in this kinde, it is a wrong to our selues, in causing others though iniustly and vndeseruedly to thinke euill of vs, and 
                     Rom. 14.16. 1. Cor. 10.28, 29, 30. 
                  making our commodity and Christian liberty to be euill spoken of. A thing not to be lightly regarded of vs, what other, our brethren especially

shall thinke of, or speake by vs: since

It is a wrong therefore to thy selfe, in that 
                     Rom. 14.16. thou causest thy selfe to be euill thought of without cause: it is a wrong to thy brother, in that 
                     Rom. 14.10. thou giuest him occasion to offend in misiudging of thee. It is a sinne 
                     Rom. 14.13, 14, 15. against charity; for it is a breach of charitie to do that needlesly that may vex thy weake brothers minde; 
                     Rom. 14.17, 18, 19. against peace and concord, giuing occasion of vaine and needelesse disagreement; yea euen against piety too; for 1. Cor. 8.11. 
                  in offending thy weake brother thou sinnest against Christ; in occasioning him to stumble and fall, (so much as in thee lieth) 
                     Rom. 14.15, 20. 1. Cor. 8.12. 
                  thou destroiest him that Christ died for. And therefore where thou findest that thy liberty doth or may in likelihood offend, there

                  
                     Rom. 14.16. 1. Cor. 10.29. for thine owne sake, for

                     Rom. 14.1. 1. Cor. 8.7. his weaknesse sake, for 
                     Rom. 14.15, 18. Christ thy Sauiours sake forbeare: 
                     Rom. 14.22. 
                  hold thy faith within thy selfe; keepe thy knowledge to thy selfe; and say with 1. Cor. 8.13. the Apostle, If cards or tables offend my brother, I will neuer play at them while the world standeth, that I may not offend him.
               
               The rule here is in a word, that It is not lawfull to play needlesly before or with those that hold such games vnlawfull, and who it is likely will in that regard take occasion of offense at it.
               
               § 7. Fiftly our recreations are to be vsed prudently and prouidently in regard of our selues, as well as inoffensiuely in regard of others: it being a point of spirituall wisedome therefore, to forbeare the vse of such games either in whole or in part, as either may be, or we haue found to be, occasions of sinne to vs. For as 1. Cor. 10.23. the former made them inconuenient, so 1. Cor. 6.12. this maketh them vnexpedient, when they may, and so far forth as they may, endanger vs by sinne.
               In part they are to bee forborne in some cases, when not the game it selfe, but the manner of it (which yet may be reformed by vs) occasioneth the euill. Where commeth to bee condemned againe that eagernesse in game, that wee spake of before, that playing for great summes, not in regard of it selfe alone, and the losse that it bringeth with it; but further also in regard of those 
                     Substantijs perditis in blasphemias erumpant. C. l. 3. tit. 43. grieuous abuses and enormities that it vsually occasioneth men to break forth into. For let men say what they will, that it is all one to them whether they win or loose, (as 
                     B. King on Ion. lect. 9. a

reuerend Prelate of ours yet liuing, whose words I oft willingly vse in this argument, well saith,) in such profusion of substance, as the losse cannot but pinch, so mens passions cannot but bee moued, and a troope of wretched sinnes commonly ensueth, swearing, for swearing, cursing, banning, defying, heart-burning, quarelling, fighting, spilling of blood, vnsupportable sorowes of heart, cursed despaire, selfe-executions, weedes able to blemish and disgrace the lawfullest recreation that is▪ wheresoeuer they be found, as

               Againe in some cases these games are in this regard wholy to be forborne. For where a man shall finde his owne disposition to be such as he cannot vse them at all ordinarily without much distemper, that he cannot containe himselfe when the cards or dice go against him, but that hee is ready to breake out into prophane and bad language; or that he cannot endure to be beaten at play without wrath and vexation and disquiet of minde; or though he can at sometime with somewhat adoe suppresse his vnruly passions and perturbations in this kinde, yet that ordinarily and vsually hee is ouertaken on these occasions, and in danger therefore to be ensnared and entangled that way; there it is best for a man

                  Iob made a couenant with his eyes, so to make a couenant with his hands not to handle cards or dice, which the rule of inexpediencie here striketh out of his hands.
               Yea by the former rule for a man to ioyne in play with those whom he knoweth to be such is no lesse

euill vnto him, then it were to vse it in the like case himselfe.
               The rule then here is that we vse not these games vnlesse we can rest quiet and content with the euent of them: and againe, if we can, that we doe so vse them, that we may not be tempted to disquiet and discontent thereupon. Agreeable whereunto are those golden rules of our gratious Soueraigne concerning play to his sonne;

                  to the glory of God, and 
                     Colos. 3.17. 
                  in the name of Christ Iesus,

                  sanctified vnto them by the word and by praier.
               
               Now this Caueat excludeth two extreames, Prophanesse and Presumptuousnes. First Prophanesse, that we behaue not our selues in play prophanely and vngodlily: that we so play, that we shut not God out at doores; so play that we 
                     Fr. Marbury on Psal. 32. 
                  make not the Deuill our play-fellow: Remembring that 
                     Psal. 119.1
                        •
                     8. wee play in

Gods presence, as well as pray in Gods presence; and that there is a prouidence of God watching ouer vs as well while we play, as while wee sleepe; yea that 
                     Zech. 3.10 &amp; 8.5, 10, 11, 12. by his goodnesse wee haue freedome and libertie as well for our sports and pleasures and lawfull delights, as for other our sager and more serious affaires: which are therefore as well the one as the other to be vsed with acknowledgement of Gods mercy and goodnesse, and of his gratious prouidence, whereby we enioy them, with freedome and liberty for them, not to the dishonour of him, from whom we haue the free vse of them.
               Secondly it excludeth Presumptuousnes; that howsoeuer we haue an eie vnto and take notice of Gods prouidence thus in generall, yet we take heed how we attempt to draw downe or call in his immediate prouidence or speciall presence in play to stickle betweene vs and those we play with. 
                     B. King on Ion. lect. 9. 
                  As that we be not so grosse (to vse againe the words of that worthy Prelate) on the one side as to make Fortune our Goddesse, as assigning good or euill lucke vnto her; so that we be not so saucie on the other side, as to call Gods maiestie from heauen (to guide our game, or to further our play, or) to determine our doubts: for we looke not so high in such friuolous and gamesome quarells, but as we carelesly vndertake them, so we follow them as lightly, and end them as merily. And therefore to say, as some vse, in play; God send mee such a card, or such a chaunce of the Dice, or, I pray God I may win this or that game, is too saucie and malapert behauiour for any.
               But, will some say, may not a man lawfully pray

for whatsoeuer he may wish or desire? or 1. Tim 4.4, 5. are not all our actions to be sanctified by praier? as was formerly said.
               I answere: True it is that euery action of a Christian man is to be sanctified by praier either generall or speciall, but not euery action with euery sort and manner of petition or praier. A man may pray for his recreations, that he may cary himselfe 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  soberly and without offence in them, and that euen by them he may be the better fitted for better things: and such praier is sufficient to sanctifie them to him conceiued either in generall or in speciall, as he findeth and feeleth his heart affected, and as occasions and circumstances either admit or require it. This then in game ought to be a mans generall desire, which he may also by praier lawfully impart to God, if hee please. Beside which other againe more particular desires a man may haue also in game, as to win rather then to loose, to ouercome rather then to bee conquered; neither are such desires euill, so they be moderate; (for they are idle and friuolous, yea dangerous where they grow excessiue and immoderate, being other then befitteth the nature of that which they concerne) yet are they not such as it is seemely to acquaint God withall. For the better conceiuing whereof consider we thus much: that 
                     To desire is not to pray, but sheweth what wee approue. H Smith in Pilgrims wish.
                  euery desire is not by and by a praier; albeit euery praier ordinarily import some desire; neither is euery lawfull desire a fit matter for praier. For prayer is a wish or desire of the heart directed vnto God. But many things we desire and may lawfully desire, which yet are not matters of that moment as may

be fit to acquaint God in particular with our desire of them, or to direct our petitions in speciall manner to him for them; much lesse to expect or require at Gods hand any speciall worke or helpe of his for the effecting of them. And of this kinde are those latter sort of desires; of which to say therefore in game, I pray God I may win, or, I would to God I might haue such a card, or such a cast, is too too much presumptuousnes, and will not well stand with that reuerent respect that each one of vs oweth to Gods maiestie.
               The rule then is here, that as we exclude not Gods presence inplay; so we call not in his prouidence to further our play. It is one thing to play before the Prince and in his presence, an other thing 
                     Easlie histor. of Gospell. 
                  to call him in to stickle betweene vs at some question about a measuring cast: So it is one thing to play as before God and in his presence; and another thing it is to make God our play-fellow, or to call him in to help and further our game, that which a Christian man may not doe.
               § 9. And these be the Cautions that I haue thought good to propound for the limiting and rectifying of the vse of these games: Which cautions, I confesse, the most of them are such, as concerne game in generall, (

Yet I supposed it not amisse to point at them, and in some sort also to presse them: partly that I might not be taxed and censured as a Pleader

for sin and such abuses as are common as well in these game as in other, by meanes whereof those that condemne all Lots vsed in game simply are wont to take occasion to make them in generall more odious: and partly also that no prophane person that abuseth any of these or other the like games, might be able to take any colour of aduantage by ought that hath beene spoken of the lawfulnesse of the games themselues in themselues simply considered, to iustifie his owne abuse of them in mispending his time, or wasting his estate at them, or otherwise inconsiderately and irreligiously abusing them: which it may be some would haue done, had I beene silent in this part, and propounded such Cautions onely as the nature of the Lot it selfe might seeme to require.
               Yea but, will some say, had it not beene much better to haue passed ouer all this with silence, knowing your iudgement in this point to be such as differeth from diuers very reuerend and religious? Or is it not in this case, as

                   one sometime said of Images, an easier matter wholy to take away the vse of them, then to keepe them free from abuse?
               
               Hereunto I answere: First, these abuses are common to all kinde of game: they accompany other games as well as these in those that be euill minded and prophanely disposed. And the like therefore in that regard may be said either of all other games, or of any other particular game, at least in ordinarie vse.
               Secondly, it is true indeede, that where the vse and the abuse of a thing are so enwrapped and entangled

together, that they cannot be easily seuered the one from the other, there the vse of the thing it selfe, if it be vnnecessarie otherwise, would wholy be abandoned. But in these games the vse and the abuse may, for the most part, (some speciall dispositions onely excepted,) by those that desire to walke in the feare of God, easily be seuered. For as for those that make no conscience of their courses, they will not be disswaded from them, though it be neuer so euidently discouered vnto them in what manner they abuse them, and by their abuse of them make that euill and vnlawfull to themselues, that otherwise were not such in it selfe. And for those that feare God, they may with ease as well rectifie and sanctifie these lusorious Lots to themselues, as they may any other games of the like vse, and as easily seuer them from such abuses as are commonly committed in them, as they may other disports, as draughts, and boules and the like, that are commonly vsed and generally allowed.
               Thirdly, though many godly dissent, yet, I am sure, many, and, I suppose, more by many, both reuerend and religious concurre. And the truth is needfull to be knowne, especially concerning matters in common practise, that men may haue whereby to informe themselues aright.
               And lastly, though the mindes and iudgements of others were not knowne; yet were not a truth to be concealed, because some few godly haue denied or opposed it, and none publikely by writing haue contradicted them in it, especially being a point, very needfull to be knowne.
               
                  § 10. For my selfe, I was at first the rather induced to deliuer my iudgement in the point the more largely (hauing entred into this discourse of Lots in generall by pursuite of 
                     Ion. chap. 1. that Scripture that then I dealt with, though far then from any purpose to publish ought of this argument) vpon these considerations.
               First I considered that

And that it is not good therefore by possessing of men's mindes with vnnecessarie scruples, either to discourage those that be comming on to some loue and liking of the good waies of God, or 1. Cor. 735. to cast those that are already come on into snares of mens knitting,

not, as for a man to suppose that the creature can do that which indeed it cannot do.
               Secondly, I considered that many (as I am verily perswaded) truly fearing God, and sincerely religious, haue vsed and doe commonly vse these games; and besides, that many well affected are and haue beene constrained in regard of scruple in this kinde, to straine themselues to some inconueniences by the refusall of them, when by those whom they haue had dependance vpon, or familiaritie withall, they haue beene vrged occasionally thereunto. It seemed fit and needfull therefore to be knowne, what ground and warrant both the one had, and the other might haue for the vse of them; which were I not vpon due and diligent discussion, and that not of late only, vndoubtedly perswaded to be sound and firme, farre should it haue beene from me euer to haue opened my mouth in this Argument.
               Thirdly, I considered that the Arguments and Grounds whereupon these Games are condemned, haue made many stagger in the necessary vse of serious ciuill Lots, which by occasion of bargaines bought in common betweene them and others, they are enforced oft to vse, but haue doubted whether they might lawfully giue consent vnto or no. That which was indeed the first occasion of my searching and sifting out more narowly the nature of Lots in generall. And certaine it is, admit we the principall arguments vsed against this kinde of L

               Fourthly, I considered the great offence and scandall

that is taken by diuers of contrary iudgement against those that vse these games, though neuer so soberly and seasonably, as they suppose, on good ground: a meanes oft of much heart-burning and of breach of Christian affection, yea of

                   it ought not so to doe. Considering therefore that these games can hardly be wholly remoued, being so common, so generall, so vsuall with the most euery where, I supposed it would not be vnfit to assay, if by discouerie of the ground of them, such scandall and offence might be staied, and Christian concord and amitie in part procured and maintained betweene such as were before diuersly minded in this matter; so many of them at least as might heare and apprehend the force and weight of the former Arguments, and be brought to see the inualiditie and insufficiencie of their owne grounds against them. Wherein what I haue done (mine endeuour hath beene to doe it) let the iudicious and vnpartiall whosoeuer, be Iudges.
               To draw to a conclusion, I could wish in this case, as 
                     Act. 26.29. 1. Cor. 7.7. the Apostle doth in some other cases, that euery one were affected in this point as

               CHAP. X. Of Extraordinary or Diuinatory Lots.
               § 1. HItherto haue we considered of the former sort of Lots, which we tearme Ordinary, be they serious or lusorious, because the vse of them requireth but an ordinary power onely, for the effecting of that whereunto they are imployed; which we haue shewed to be lawfull, if they be lawfully vsed.
               We are now to consider of the latter sort of them, which we tearme Extraordinary, and are by most Diuines commonly called 
                     Sors diuinatoria Thom. &amp; alij, generalius quàm nō
                        nulli, qui diuinam à diuinatoria distinguunt, vt Peucer. &amp; Krakeuits.
                   
                  Diuinatory Lots.
               
               Extraordinary Lots therefore are such as require an extraordinarie power and prouidence, for the disposing and directing of them or the euent of them, in regard of those things whereunto they are applied. Because it is not in the power of those that vse them, or in the nature of the Lot it selfe simply considered, to effect that thereby necessarily, whereunto it is imployed. And herein consisteth the maine difference betweene these Lots and the former, (which being not considered hath bred much confusion, and occasioned such diuersitie of opinion among Authors in this argument) that in the former Lots there is nothing necessarily required, but what is in the naturall power of the creatures

vsing them and vsed in them to effect; it being in the naturall power of the one to fall this or that way, and of the other vpon mutuall consent thereby to determine of such matters as are in their power: whereas in these latter Lots, which wee come now to consider of, it is not at all in the naturall power either of the persons vsing them or of the creatures vsed in them, to effect necessarily that whereunto they are vsed; but some other secret worke, either diuine or diabolicall, is of necessitie thereunto required. And these are those that are most commonly tearmed Diuinatorie Lots; vnder which head may we well comprehend also those that they call 
                     Consultorias huc partim refert Lauat in Prou 16 &amp; consultorias has appellat Thom. de sort. c. 2. 
                  consultorie; being vsed, as the former for diuision and distribution, so these for diuination, and consultation by way of diuination: the former were meere diuiding or deciding, these are also diuining Lots; those meerely ciuill, these either sacrilegious or sacred.
               § 2. Now these Lots Extraordinarie are vsed for two ends; either for the discouery of some hidden matter past, or present; or for the presaging and foretelling of some future euent. Of either sort we haue Examples great, and more then good, store, both in holy writ, and in prophane Writers, beside the daily practise of many as well among vs as else-where.
               In holy writ wee finde that they haue sometime beene vsed for the discouery of some hidden truth in things present or past, and that either in matter of distribution, or of retribution; of office or of iustice.
               
                  In the former case they haue beene vsed to discouer and make knowne, whom God deemeth fittest, or hath secretly fore-assigned to some place or estate. And herein is the difference betweene the former vsed ordinarily in election of officers and disposition of offices, and the vse of those in these cases that now we entreate of; that in the former it being in the power of the parties choosing to chuse where they list and like best, they agree to make their election by Lot, and there is nothing else required of the Lot, but to light vpon any one of those that are by them propounded; whereas as in these latter it is not wholy in their power, but either there is required the further consent of some other whose good-will they are vncertaine of and seeke to know it by Lot, or the choise is to be made by Gods speciall appointment, whose secret will and purpose they desire by this meanes to discouer.
               Examples we haue in Scripture of Lots vsed on this manner in matter of Mariage, and of Magistracie, or of Office as well ciuill as sacred.
               In matter of Mariage it is somewhat of the nature of a Lot that Eliezer Abrahams seruant vsed, when 
                     Genes. 24.12, 13, 14, 15. he desired of God, what time he was sent to fetch a wife for his young-master and stood by the well-side, that if of the Maidens that came thither to draw, she of whom he should request to drinke of her pitcher, should make him offer to water his Camels also, shee might thereby be knowne to be the party that God had appointed to be his Masters sonnes wife: which 
                     Ibid. vers. 17, 18, 19. falling out afterward with one of them accordingly, 
                     Ibid. vers. 42, 
                        〈◊〉
                      48. he vseth it as an argument

to perswade her parents that God had so appointed it; who being also thereby perswaded do likewise 
                     Ibid. vers. 50. rest thereupon and condescend thereunto.
               For as for Iosephus his idle conceipts 
                     Ioseph. antiquit. lud. l. 1. c. 16. that Eliezer should desire by praier that Rebekka, whom his Master and he had made choise of before, if God approued that their choice, might be one of those wenches that came to draw water, and might hereby be knowne which of them she were, many comming together, by giuing him drinke when the rest should denie it him; and that accordingly when they refused all but shee to let him drinke, excusing themselues that they drew it for other necessarie vses, and that it was not easie to draw, she should thereupon rebuke the rest of them for their vncurteous demeanour, and offer her selfe kindly to fulfill his request; they are but meere surmises and fancies, hauing no ground in, nor well agreeing with the story, as

                   some others haue conceipted of this example; as if his meaning and purpose had beene to pray vnto God, that such a

Maiden among them that came to draw water, as should by her behauiour in that particular shew her selfe to be of a free, courteous and ingenuous disposition, might be the wife that God had appointed for his young-master Isaak. And so it should not b
                     •
                   either a Lot, or a signe so much of Gods designement, as of the Maides inward disposition arguing one meete for such a match. Now there is great oddes indeed betweene these two, for one to pray that the party, that by such an answere shall shew her selfe to bee thus or thus disposed, may be wife to such an one; and to pray that that party that God in his prouidence hath appointed to bee such an ones wife, may be certainely knowne and distinguished by such a casuall signe from all others: as I haue heard of one that hauing cast his wandring affection in that kinde on a woman, would needes propound this as a signe to himselfe, that if at Church asking to see her booke she should point him withall to the Preachers text, she should be the woman that God had assigned to be his wife. In the former there is no Lot, nor diuination at all, to speake properly; but an humane and morall coniecture by outward behauiour of inward disposition, and a desire of matching with such an one, if God see it so good. In the other there is a signe set in nature of a Lot, to discouer what lieth hid in Gods secret counsell; and that by such a course as of it selfe hath no kinde of congruity in nature with the thing to be discouered. Eliezers act is rather of the latter kinde then of the former, not iustifiable vnlesse it were done, vpon speciall instinct, knowne to

the conceiuer of such praier, for the vse of such a signe in such sort.
               § 3. Againe thus haue Lots beene vsed as in matter of Mariage, so in matter of Magistracie and gouernment, for distribution of offices as well ciuill as sacred.
               First ciuill: and so Saul was by Lot chosen King. Which Lot was not meerely diuisory, vsed barely to determine who should gouerne Gods people, but diuinatorie rather, vsed to discouer whom God had secretly appointed and set apart for that place as then fittest for the same. The busines was thus caried. 1. Sam. 10.17, to 22. 
                  Samuel that had the chiefe hand in the ordering of it, caused the people sorted into their seuerall Tribes to appeare before the Lord (

                     Psal 89.20. sacred oyle sanctified and set him apart to that office; as after he did 1. Sam. 16.13.

               § 4. And thus haue Lots diuinatorie beene vsed in matter of distribution, and of office: now there hath beene likewise further vse of them for matter of retribution, and of iustice, in question of offence: and that either where the offence is either altogether vncertaine whether there haue beene any committed or no; or where the offence is certaine in generall, that there hath beene some committed, but it is not knowne in particular either who the Offendor or what the offence is; or lastly where the offence is knowne in particular what it is, but the Offendor is not. So that the Lot hath in these cases beene vsed to discouer sometime whether there were any offence done or not; sometime who were the Offendors,

and so what the offence was; sometime who were the Offendors in such an offence as was knowne to haue beene committed before.
               Sometime a Lot hath beene vsed where it was wholy vncertaine whether any offence had beene committed or no, where both offence, Offendors, and party offended haue beene altogether vncertaine. Thus when there was 1. Sā. 5.6, 9, 12. a plague vpon the Philistines, but they knew not well either from whence or for what it came, 1 Sā. 6.7, to 13. they were aduised by their Wisards, to send away the Arke of the God of ISRAEL 1. Sam. 4.11. taken before in fight by them, in a Cart drawne by two new-milch Kine that had calues, which if they drew it toward Bethshemesh, they might thereby know, that it was the GOD of ISRAEL that had plagued them; if any other way, that it was then but some chaunce that befell them. Which course being accordingly put vnto triall, the Kine drew the Cart directly vnto Beth-shemesh; and thereby discouered vnto them both their offence, and the partie offended with them, the Author of the euill that had lately befalne them. Which practise of theirs though I dare not say as some doe, that it was vndertaken of them

                  by diuine instinct, much lesse by any such instinct that themselues were aware of, (for both these must concurre to make such an act as that warrantable to any) it seeming rather to haue risen from their wonted magicall superstitions; yet was it no doubt accompanied with a speciall prouidence of God, as 
                     Vise quae Chrys. hac dere ad Tit. hemil. 3. &amp; Martyr latissimè in 1. Sā. 6. the same Authors with others haue well obserued, thereby conuincing them as it were by their owne euidences, and by

their wicked courses gaining glory to himselfe.
               § 5. Sometime againe a Lot hath beene vsed, where the offence in generall hath beene certaine, but the particular of it vncertaine, for the finding out of the Offendor, that by his confession vpon his apprehension the offence also might come to light.
               Thus was Ionathan discouered, hauing 1. Sam 14

                  § 7. Now further Lots Extraordinarie haue sometime beene vsed as for the discouery of some hidden matter past or present, so for the presaging or foretelling of some future euent, thereby to direct men what course to take in their affaires, or what successe they might therein expect. So that 
                     Hinc Thom. de sort. c. 2. sortes super Iona, Ionathan, Achane, Matthia iactas diuisorias facit: ab Hamane iactas consultorijs annumerat.
                   as the former extraordinary Lots were partly diuisory and partly diuinatorie, so these latter are partly consultory and partly diuinatory, being vsed partly for consultation and partly for diuination, or for consultation by way of diuination. For to diuide ought by Lot barely is ordinarie, and maketh a Lot meerely diuisory: but to diuide or share out ought by Lot, expecting to haue the diuision by Lot made exactly and precisely according to the right of the thing diuided in regard of those among whom it is diuided, or according to the truth of some thing that is thereby enquired into, is extraordinary and maketh it a diuinatory Lot. Againe to distribute offices by Lot barely, as to designe thereby who shall haue this place who that place, or who be admitted and who excluded, is ordinary and but diuisory; but to expect that God should thereby reueale whom hee deemeth fit or vnfit, or whom he hath fore-assigned to any office, is extraordinarie and diuinatory. And so here to determine by Lot what course a man shal take of two equally and indifferently propounded, is ordinary, and maketh a Lot meerely diuisory; or if consultory, but improperly so tearmed: but to enquire or determine by it what course is best to take as likely to proue luckiest and most successefull, is extraordinarie, and maketh

a Lot diuinatorie and consultorie properly so tearmed.
               Now to this purpose are Lots found vsed, either where the attempt it selfe is questioned, or where the attempt and busines it selfe is resolued, but the circumstances of time place and person are yet vndetermined.
               First where the attempt it selfe is not fully resolued on. As 1. Sam. 14.6, to 16. where Ionathan and his armour-bearer agree to shew themselues to a garrison of the Philistines, who if vpon discouery of them they should will them to stay till they come to them, they would then stay their attempt and not proceede on with it; but if they should call them to come vp to them, they would go on in their attempt, taking that as a signe that God would giue them victory against them. Which when they had accordingly made triall of, and the Philistines inuited them to come vp vnto them, they clambered vp the rocke on their hands and their feete to them, and GOD discomfited the Philistines that they fled before them, and they slew a twentie of them within compasse of an aker of ground. It was not

                     Omen: genus diuinandi non nonū. Mart. ibid.
                   a signe that Ionathan set himselfe, much like 
                     Genes. 24.14. that of Eliezer Abrahams man before mentioned, whereby he minded to discouer whether God were pleased to further and giue successe to them in that enterprise or no.
               § 8. Secondly Lots haue beene thus vsed where the attempt or busines it selfe hath beene resolued

on; but the circumstances of time, place, or persons haue beene vndetermined.
               Sometime they are found vsed where the persons against whom the attempt should be giuen are vndetermined, and question being of twaine or more, it is decided by Lot, which of them shall bee first dealt withall.
               Thus it is said of the King of Babel Nebuchadnezar, that 
                     Ezech. 21.19, to 24. he should stand at the head of a crosseway where two turnings were, the one leading toward Iury and Ierusalem, the other toward Ammon and Rabba their head City: there he should consult with his Diuines, that is, his Soothsaiers or Sorcerers; and among other courses, beside inspection of the liuer and entrailes of beasts sacrificed, (a practise among the Heathen likewise much vsed) thereby to coniecture what successe he should haue; hee should draw

                   Lots also to trie which way were best for him to take, whether to bend his forces in the first place against Ammon or against Iuda, against Ierusalem or against Rabba: and the Lot in his right hand should come forth for Ierusalem; God in his secret prouidence so disposing it, as he fore-telleth by the Prophet, for the deserued destruction of his owne rebellious people.
               Now this diuination of theirs was performed and practised, as some thinke,

               Sometime againe are Lots vsed where all other circumstances are resolued on, and the time onely vndetermined.

                  Haman had resolued to doe what he could for the destroying and rooting out of the whole Iewish nation, he caused Lots to be cast for the day and the time; that is, by Lot he made enquiry what time would be fittest and most fortunate for the enterprising or executing of that his exploite. And the Lots being cast in the first month Nisan about our March from day to day and from month to month, fell out vpon Adar the twelfth Month much about our February, neere vpon a twelue-month betweene;

               So that all these courses are there ioyned together, as they hang all on one string, and they are all alike prohibited and condemned by God, as being practises that

                     Deut. 18.12. 
                  For all that doe such things are abomination to the Lord thy God: who will 
                     Deut. 18.14. 
                  not therefore suffer any of his to do so. What could bee more plainely or pregnantly spoken for the condemning of these courses, and for the remouing of that obiection, which men commonly make? to wit; What hurt is there in these things? What euill is there in a spell or a charme, as long as there is nothing but good words in it? or what harme can there be, in casting of Lots, or in drawing of cuts, or in pulling an arow out of a quiuer, in holding a siue betweene two hands, making a childe run betweene two fires, breaking a bone betweene twaine, and the like? Yea but, saith God, these bee courses that I vtterly abhorre, when they are vsed to these ends; and all that so vse them, or haue dealing with them, by causing such things to be done by others for them, are not abominable onely, but euen abomination it selfe in my sight. That which should be a sufficient argument to vs, to make vs

               § 3. But that wee may the better conceiue the cause why God thus forbiddeth and abhorreth these courses: (for it is not without speciall reason

ordinarily that God enioynes or inhibites ought:) let vs in the next place more particularly consider the manifold euils that are in these practises: whereby it shall euidently appeare, that men make themselues guiltie of Curiosity, of Superstition, of Idolatry, of Presumption, of diabolicall Impiety, and of high Treason against Gods maiesty.

                     Ioan. 21.22. he rebuked Peter by name for being ouer inquisitiue in that kinde. But where God hath denied men ordinarie meanes of discouery, there doth he reserue and keepe things in his owne power; concerning which therefore that rule of Gods Spirit holdeth,

                  1. Sam. 6.19. It was death for any man to looke into the Arke, or 
                     Num. 4.15, 20. but to peepe into the holy of holies. And as it is sinne for a man to search and pry into what God hath concealed; so to search by such courses as he hath not warranted; or to search into such things, as it is therefore apparent that he hath concealed and would haue hid from vs, in that he hath taken away all ordinarie meanes of discouery, and offereth not extraordinary meanes of himselfe: which howsoeuer we may accept, yea 
                     Esai 7.12, 13, 14. wee ought not to refuse, when God offereth and suggesteth them to vs; for that were to contemne God; so wee ought not to desire or request at Gods hands, much

lesse frame them to our selues, when God shall not see good so to doe; for that is manifestly to tempt God.

Cic. de diuin. l. 2. to ascribe that to a Creature, or to vse a Creature to that end, which it hath no naturall power and efficacie vnto, or whereunto it is not by any diuine ordinance enabled. But in these cases is a Lot applied vnto that vse, and that vertue ascribed vnto it, which it neither hath by any naturall power of it owne, nor hath receiued by any ordinary ordinance of God, nor can atcheiue by the will or power of the Vser joined with it. For herein is the difference betweene the former Diuisory, and these Diuinatory Lots; as also betweene those speciall ones vsed at Gods expresse appointment, and these; in that the former were applied to no other ends then Lots haue power of themselues io
                     •
                  ned with mans will and consent to effect; the latter likewise to such as they had power to effect by vertue of Gods couenant or appointment ioined with them.
               For example: a Lot hath a power of it selfe to light vncertainely, and yet certainely in some sort; vncertainely, because indefinitely, for it is in possibilitie

to fall diuers waies: and yet certainly in some sort, because it can light actually but one way alone: this power it hath naturally of it selfe; but beside this power, from the will of men and their mutuall consent it may receiue further power to arbitrate such things as they haue power to dispose of. But neither hath a Lot any power of it selfe, neither can any man by his owne will, or many men by their mutuall consent giue any such power vnto it as to make it light so that it shall necessarily discouer somewhat that is hidden and secret to them that so vse it: and therefore so to vse it is meere superstition.
               Againe a Lot may haue power by Gods will and appointment to reueale and discouer some such matter, and it had so in the lawfull Lots extraordinary before mentioned. But in these we now deale with, there is no such appointment or agreement of God betweene vs and him; and therefore they can not be sure to haue any such power now from him. To make that wee say by instances more euident: Water hath a naturall power to wash and to clense the body, and men may vse it therefore to that end. But to be a 
                     Rom. 4.11. signe and seale of Gods couenant of grace, that it hath not but by 
                     Matth. 28.18. Mark. 16.16. speciall appointment from God, and therefore may not to that end be vsed of any saue 1. Cor. 12.13. Galat. 3.27. those alone that are in such couenant with God. 
                     Psal. 104.15. Bread likewise hath a naturall power to nourish mans body, and yet not that neither, vnlesse a man receiue it and retaine it and concoct and digest it. But 
                     Matth. 26.26. 1. Cor. 11.23, 24. to be a Type of Christs body, that it hath from his institution onely; without

out which no power or skill of man could make it to be such: else why might not a peice of flesh do as well as a bit of bread? and 
                     Exod. 12.3, to 9. Leuit. 1. &amp; 4 &amp; 16.15. 1. Cor. 5.7. Coloss 2.17. that was once, but now is not, a Type of Christs body, because there was an ordinance then for it, whereas now there is none. Againe 
                     Luk. 10.34. 
                  the Samaritan is said to haue washed his neighbours wounds with wine and oyle mixt together. But our Sauiour Christ

                   The one hath warrant to be vsed still, because it had and hath still such power from the nature of the creature; and therefore it is not superstitious: whereas the other can not with any good warrant be now vsed, because it had his power then not from the nature of the creature, but from the speciall will and pleasure of the Creator; which power therefore ceasing with his pleasure then, to vse the creature now to that purpose were meerely superstitious. In like manner here to vse a Lot vnto that which of it selfe it hath a naturall power vnto, or by humane helpe it may haue power to effect, is not in that regard vnlawfull: But for a man to attempt to doe that by a Lot, which neither by any naturall faculty, nor by any humane institution it hath power to performe, where there is no ordinance of God enabling it, is meere superstition.
               § 5. Thirdly those that thus vse Lotery stand guilty of Idolatry. For what is it but Idolatrie to ascribe that to the Creature that is proper to the Creator? But

Sam. c. 14. whereas wee sorted Euents before into three rankes; some necessarie, that keepe in a constant course naturally; some contingent and not casuall, that fall out for the most part alike, though they vary now and then; some Contingent and Casuall, that are altogether vncertaine, as the causes also are, whereupon they depend: The first sort, as the Eclipses of the Sunne and Moone may be certainely foreknowne and foretold, because the causes of them are constant and certainely knowne of vs; the second sort also, as disease and death in some cases may with some good probability be preconiectured and guessed at by those that are well seene and experienced in the signes and causes of either: but the third sort depending vpon causes vtterly vncertaine and vnknowne vnto vs, cannot be foreseene or foreknowne, and therefore not foretold certainly but by God himselfe alone. And 
                     Quae praesentiri aut arte, autratione, aut vsu, aut coniectura possunt, ea non diuinis, sed peritis tribuenda. ita relinquitur, vt ea fortuita diuinari possint, qua nulla nec arte, nec sapientia praeuideri possunt. Cicer. de diuin l. 2. in this third sort of Euents alone is this kinde of Lot conuersant, which no wit or skill of man is able to foredetermine or foresee. This kinde therefore of Lot Diuinatory and Diuination by Lotery is not onely, as the Canon iustly chargeth it,

For whereas some, it may be, will say: Yea but wee expect not the euent when we vse Lots on this wise from the creature, but from God himselfe the Creator. I answer those that so say: It is impietie and presumption for any to doe so. For what is this but a tempting and a stinting of God? what is it but a prescribing of God what hee shall doe? It is not therefore true nor sound that some say, that

                     Miserum est in necessitate viuere: sed in necessitate viuere necessitas nulla est. Senic, epist. 12. 
                  It is a miserable thing for a man to liue in necessitie; but there is no necessity at all for any man so to liue: So say I here, It is an hard case for a man to be driuen to that streight, that he must of necessity betake himselfe to such courses: but 
                     In diuinatoria sorte non videtur praedicta necessitas occurrere. Thom. de sort. c. 5. there is no necessity at any time that so hee should doe. For what necessitie speake they of that should warrant such a course? If absolute necessity; there is none such: For there cannot be any case possibly put, wherein a man is so streightned, that he cannot auoide it, but that of necessity hee must doe it. If conditionall necessity, that either a man must doe it, or he must sustaine damage, yea or hee must die if he doe it not; yet here is no such necessity as may iustifie such an act.

                        m de error. mag. part. 2. there is at least a secret, if not an open, league and commerce with Satan in the practise of such superstitions, (which 1. Cor. 10.10. no Christian ought to haue) whatsoeuer men may pretend, yea or intend in the vse of them. For as the Apostle telleth the Corinthians that haunted the Heathens idolatrous feasts to please or pleasure their Heathen friends, that albeit in so doing they had no such purpose as to be in league and amity with Idoles or Deuills, yet 1. Cor. 10.14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. that very act of theirs was a kinde of society with either: so here the very vse of these diabolicall courses, though many it may be intend nothing lesse in the vse of them, is no other then a trading and a trafficking with Satan, 
                     Amputari itaque &amp; eradicari ab animo Christiano istiusmodi debent. August. de doctrina Christiana lib. 2. cap. 25. which euen in that regard therefore all good Christians ought to abhorre.
               So then, dost thou make enquiry into such things as God by ordinary courses refuseth to discouer? thou becommest guilty of Curiosity. Doest thou vse the creature to that purpose that hath no naturall power thereunto? it is meere Superstition. Doest

thou expect the euent of it in that kinde from the Creature that thou vsest in it? thou committest grosse idolatry: thou makest an Idole of it. Doest thou expect it from Satan? that is plaine and euident witchery. Or lastly doest thou vse onely such superstitious courses as hee or his lims and instruments haue beene Authors and Broachers of, and which can haue no efficacie of themselues without him and his helpe? whether thou do expect the euent from him or no, euen so also is it no better then Witcherie; yea it is hainous impiety, and (which in the last place we now charge it with) it is high Treason against Gods Maiesty, which hee therefore hath at sundry times punished most seuerely.

Yea how a meaner man would take it, any one that hath tenants, or children, or seruants, if some one of them that depend on him or belong to him, should vpon some hard vsage of him, or because he refuseth presently to right and releeue him, when he may, in some wrongs that he hath sustained at some enemies hand, or by meanes of a bad neighbour, betake himselfe instantly to his deadly and irreconcileable enemie, one that he knoweth his Land-Lord, or Father, or Master cannot endure or abide of all men in the world; how offensiue, I say, such a course would be vnto any euen the meanest of vs, I may well leaue to each ones particular heart to determine.

                  that their Land it should spew them out, as it had spewed those out, that were before them in it. And surely, if God destroied those Gentiles, not for doing these things themselues so much, as for hearkning to those that dealt in them, as he 
                     Deut. 18.14, 12. there saith; if he destroyed those Gentiles, I say, for so doing, that had neuer these lawes giuen them, but the generall light and

               § 11. But God, it may bee, though hee be so sharpe to others, yet with his owne will not deale so rigorously, though they be this way faulty. Nothing lesse: As for these practises he destroied those Heathens; so he spared not his owne people when they tooke the like courses: his iudgements inflicted vpon them remaine vpon record, as well on Prince

as people, yea vpon the whole body, euen on both of them together for sins of this nature.
               Where consider we the Examples, first of two Kings; then of two Kingdomes and States. The one of 2 King. 1.2, to 7.

                     ron to enquire whether he should rise and recouer againe, lying then sicke and sore bruised with a fall; as if there had beene no God for him to aduise with in Israell; hath this answere returned him from the true God, whom he should haue sent vnto, by Elias his Minister, meeting by the way with the Kings Messengers, that therefore hee should not rise againe from his sicke-bed that he was laid on, but should assuredly die. The other of Saul, of whom this is noted as the maine cause of his ouerthrow: 1. Chron. 10.13, 14. 
                  Thus died Saul for his sinne, whereby he sinned against God, in that he regarded not his word; and in that hee sought to, and asked aduice of one that had a familiar, and asked not of the Lord: and therefore the Lord slew him, and turned the Kingdome to Dauid. Where are two sinnes especially pointed out as the principall causes of Sauls downefall: the former whereof is said else-where to be 1. Sam. 15.23. 
                  as Witchery and Idolatry; the latter was 1. Sam 28.8, 14. 
                  Witchery and Idolatry indeed. And yet was Sauls case more excusable, then the case of the most is that vse the like practises among vs. For hee had not lost some sory trifle, and desired to know what was become of it: but 1. Sam. 28.5. he stood in icopardie of loosing life and li
                     •
                  ing, crowne and kingdome; and he had tried all the courses hee could whereby he might be resolued of the issue of it, ere hee repaired to the Witch. For it is said, 1. Sam. 28.6. 
                  He asked aduice

of God, and God would giue him no answere, neither by Vision, nor Prophet, nor by Vrim and Thummim. And how is it said then, may some say, that 1. Chron. 10.14. 
                  hee asked not aduice of him? But the Holy Ghost accounteth it as good as no asking, when God refusing to reueale things by lawfull meanes, men rest not therein, but seeke to come to the knowledge of them by such courses as God would neuer counsel or aduise them vnto. Againe 1. Sam. 28.1
                        •
                     . his request to the Witch was to haue a word or two with Samuel onely; not with the Deuill, but with a good Prophet of God lately deceased: neither did he suppose it to be the Deuill that he talked or dealt with; for 1. Sam. 28.14. he tooke him that he saw to be Samuel, though indeed

                  Witchery and Sorcery? Yea left any should surmise that his oppressions and murthers were rather the maine cause of all those miseries that befell that State, because 2 King. 24.4. in some places there is speciall mention made of them; the Holy Ghost therefore in the story of Manasses

To draw all to an head then, and so to conclude this last argument: Seeing that God hath restrained vs of all resort vnto Satan, and wee our selues in our Baptisme haue renounced all kinde of dealing with the Deuill; wee breake our faith solemnely plighted to God, and make our selues guilty of rebellion and high treason against God, whensoeuer by these courses we seeke to him and aske aduice of him, whether we beleeue and trust in him or no.
               Againe seeing that the sinne of Witchcraft (and this Sorcery is one kinde of it) is so hainous and so capitall a crime that God commandeth the Witch to be put to death, whether she helpe or hurt, euen for this cause because she is a Witch and dealeth by the Deuil, and we our selues in our owne conscience

cannot but condemne such kinde of people, as those of whom, no lesse truely then vsually, wee are wont to say, that they haue sold themselues and their soules to Satan; then surely it must needes be a most damnable and detestable practise in vs, though there were no further sinne on our part then so, to imploy any, or to vse the imployment of any in such actions, as we know that they hazard the casting away of their soules in them. We might as well make vse of some swaggering Cutter to reuenge vs by murther on one that hath wronged vs; or procure some Knight of the post to periure himselfe for the recouery of a iust debt vniustly denied vs; or hire some light Huswife to entice a man to lewdnesse and to play the Whore with him, as 
                     Iudg. 16.5. 
                  Dalilah with Sampson, thereby to discouer something that we suspect him to haue wronged vs in. For murther and witch-craft are sinnes alike notorious in Gods eies, who hath therefore assigned 
                     Exod.

And Sorcery and Periury are very neere of one nature: since by the one a man wilfully casteth his soule into Gods hands; and by the other he solemnely putteth his soule ouer into the Deuills hands. And Fornication in it selfe simply considered is a farre lesse sinne then this is: as appeareth plainely hereby, in that God hath assigned only 
                     Deut. 22.28, 29 a mulct or a money paiment for the one, but hath appointed a capitall punishment, euen losse of life, for the other. But now more then that, when 
                     Leuit. 20.6. God himselfe hath adiudged those to death also that seek vnto such, as well as the parties themselues; and hath sealed vp his hatred and detestation of such

courses, by staying two Kings for them Abazias and Saul, the one by sicknesse, the other by the sword, by his owne sword, by himselfe; yea not slaying Saul himselfe onely, but rooting out his posterity and cutting the crowne of from him and his; and further yet by destroying whole Nations and ouerturning whole States for these sinnes, as the Canaanites and those that he cast out before his people, and his owne people themselues too as well as those that he cast out before them, when they tooke the like courses: We cannot but see, if we will not

               An Admonition to auoide these diuining Lots, with Answere to some Arguments alleadged in defence of them: and the Conclusion of the whole.
               § 1. THese things then well weighed that haue formerly beene deliuered, those come in the first place here to be admonished, that haue beene at any time ouertaken this way, (not considering, it may be, the greatnesse and grieuousnesse of the sinne) not to iustifie their euill act, or to sooth vp themselues in it, because, as the Apostle 1 Timoth. 1.15. 
                  Paul saith of himselfe, when he blasphemed and persecuted, and 
                     Act. 3.17. 
                  Peter of the Iewes, when they crucified Christ, they did it in ignorance. For

yea if it were simple, thou canst not now but repent thee of thy sinne. For

                        aeritur quo modo captus fueris, sed quod captus fis. Chrysost. in Act homil. 29. as the Fowler, hauing the Fowle fast by the one foot, is content to let her haue the libertie of both wings and the whole body besides; that is enough to giue him the command of the whole: So though thou liue otherwise vnblameably, yet is this one wicked course enough of it selfe to engage thee body and soule vnto Satan; it is alone sufficient to giue the Deuill title and interest to the whole. In a word, either thou sinnedst ignorantly, or wittingly: if ignorantly, thine ignorance was either simple or affected: if of simple ignorance thou sinnedst, thou canst not but repent, now thou commest to see thy sinne; if of ignorance affected, thou hast the more cause to repent, because that lesseneth not thy sinne: and if thou sinnedst not of ignorance, but with knowledge, then hast thou yet much more cause to repent, because 
                     Iam. 4 14. Luk. 12.47. that aggrauateth thy sinne: euery

way thou hast good and iust cause to repent, because thou canst no way be freed from sinne.
               § 2. Againe, both such and all other are in the second place to be admonished, that they take heed how they giue way to such superstitious conceits and courses, whereby they shall in this manner enthrall their soules vnto Satan, and incense the wrath of God against themselues; yea which their owne conscience cannot but tell them, if they deale sincerely with it and it with them, that they are deuillish and abominable, wicked and vnwarrantable. For consider me this seriously with thy selfe; when some trifle is missing, and thou goest to worke with thy Booke and thy Key, or with thy Sine and thy Sheeres, for the finding of the Theefe; (and that it may be, when it is not stolne neither; but admit it be:) first doest thou thinke that the Booke and the Key, or the Siue and the Sheeres are either ioyntly or seuerally able to doe ought herein of themselues? Sure thou canst not be so simple as so to suppose, vnlesse there be as little witin thee as in them. Art
thou able thy selfe then to put any such power into them, which they haue not of themselues? Vndoubtedly thou canst not: it is a thing vtterly out of thy power. What then? doest thou thinke that God vpon thy fooleries will extraordinarily and miraculously work for thee? then belike thou imaginest that thou hast a miraculous faith: if thou thinkest thou hast, trie it rather in some better, in some greater matter, in some matter of more moment, as in raising of some one that is at deaths-doore in an instant: or rather, trie it in neither; thou shouldest but tempt

God in either. But suppose thou shouldest trie him, dost thou thinke he would doe it? And what reason hast thou to imagine, that God should worke extraordinarily for thee more in the one then in the other? Alike ground and warrant there is for either; a word of promise for neither. Neither canst thou easily be so sottish, as to suppose that God should doe ought in it; especially when for the most part there is no solemne seeking to God, howsoeuer there be some abuse of the name, or of the word of God now and then. If neither the thing it selfe then bee able to doe ought of it selfe, nor thou able thy selfe to giue any such power vnto it, nor God haue an hand in it, other then in all actions else whatsoeuer; what can there be then that doth it (if ought be done) but the Deuill, whose aide therefore thou implorest, and whom thou imploiest, yea whom thereby thou shewest that thou trustest in and beleeuest, whatsoeuer thou pretendest? For diddest thou suppose it to be a vaine and an idle thing, of no certaintie, thou wouldest neuer vse it. Yea diddest thou not beleeue that the Deuill could and would tell thee the truth, thou wouldest neuer resort to him, nor ground ought on his answers; thou wouldest neuer vse any such trickes of his, nor conclude ought out of the euent of them. So that in truth thy practise sheweth that thou beleeuest and trustest in him, whatsoeuer thou saiest; and so 
                     Deus dicit, homicida est: &amp; tu ad illum tanquam ad medicū curris. Dominus dicit, homicida est; illi dicunt, morbos sanat. Tu maleficia qui recipis, istorum potius quàm Christi verbis fidem habendam censes. Chrysost. cont Iud. l. 5. thou crossest our Sauiour; in that whereas he saith that 
                     Iohn 8.44. the Deuill is a Lier and the father of lies, thou supposest, yea and assurest thy selfe that by these meanes hee not onely can, but will and doth tell thee the truth.

Thine owne heart therefore, if it doe seriously and sincerely deale with thee, cannot but informe thee, that it is the Deuill thou dealest with, the first Author of all euill,

Remember that as 1. King 3 37. 
                  Shimci, when he went to seeke his seruant that was fled away from him, going beyond the bounds set him by Salomon, he went to his owne end: so when by such courses thou seekest to recouer thy losses, thou runnest vpon thine owne ruine, thou drawest destruction vpon thy selfe. As

So here the Deuill for the most part doth but delude men, in promising them that which he seldome performeth; and many times casting them into further losses, in steede of helping them to regaine and recouer the former: Or if he doe helpe thee to thy gold or thy garment againe; yet is it dearely bought, that is gotten againe in that sort: he helpeth thee, it may be, to thy gold or garment againe, to get and gaine from thee both body and soule: and thou by recouering it, yea by seeking so to recouer it, sellest him thy soule for it. Now,

                     Ne perdas tunicam, consulis mathematicum. quanto melius petiret tunica tua, quàm aniraae t

                        a? Aug. in Psal. 91. what shall it auaile a man to gaine his garment, and cast away his body that should weare it; to regaine his gold, and cast away his body that should vse it, yea to cast away his soule that may doe well enough without the body, whereas the body cannot possibly doe

well without it? Rather, as the same our Sauiour saith 
                     Matth. 5.40. in an other case, if thy coate bee gone, let gowne go after; choose rather to lose both, the one after the other, then by such courses as these are to seeke to regaine either. 
                     Matth. 5.29, 30. &amp; 18.8, 9. 
                  Better it is, saith our Sauiour, to go halt into heauen, then to go with two legges whole to hell: and better it is to go naked or thin-clad into heauen, then to go cloathed or well-appareled to hell; without money to heauen, then with mony to hell: better want meate and money, then receiue either from Satan; better lose cloathes and coine, then recouer either by Satan, or compasse either by any Satanicall course whatsoeuer. And surely, little loue shew wee, that we beare vnto God, when for such trifles as these are, we stick not thus to displease him: we cleaue nothing fast or close vnto him, when euen a twined thred, as we say, will thus pull vs away from him, and draw vs out of his way that hee hath prescribed vs.
               Let vs rather therefore in the feare of God, and as we regard our owne good, put far from vs such practises; and not forbeare them onely, but euen abhorre them, defie and detest them, not in word onely, but in deed, not in tongue only, but in truth: that so 
                     Deut. 18.13. our hearts may be sincere and entire with God, not diuided betweene God and Satan; our heads and braines busied about 
                     Rom. 12.2. 
                  searching out the holy and acceptable will of God, not about curious inquiries into such 
                     Deut. 29 29. secrets as the wisedome of God hath hid from our eyes; 
                     Rom. 6.13. our hands imploied only in the good workes of God, not in the workes of that wicked one, 
                  1. Iohn 36. 
                  which he came to dissolue and destroy in

those that be his: and 
                     Matth 7.13.14. our feete lastly walking in the straight-waies of Gods word, that leade to life and saluation, and not in Satans crooked and blinde by-paths, that tend to death and destruction.

                  Babylonian Loteries answere the expectation of those by whom they were vsed? Yea we haue found, may some say, by our owne experience, that in ordinary practise they oft proue true.
               To this I answere: First, 
                     Vera quisque sedulò notat, falsa nemo coarguit. Diodor Sicul. l. 32. de Euno.
                   they marke when they proue true, but not how oft they proue false; as the Philosopher saith of dreames, that

                   they seldome proue true, and yet many men trust in them, because they marke those onely that so proue. And as one saith of reliques and monuments hung vp by such as had made vowes to our Lady (as they tearme her,) and were deliuered being in danger and distresse, that there were many indeed of them; but 
                     Sicut &amp; Diagoras apud Cicer. do nat. Deor. l. 3 Nusquam esse pictos qui nausragiū fecerant, in marique perierant.
                   there were no reliques of those that had made the like vowes and were not deliuered, but were drowned or perished otherwise: which yet would be many more, if they were to be seene. So here a few euents are scored vp and recorded that haue falne out aright, whereas

For that they are not such as haue any diuine Art or skill at all with them: but are either superstitious Wisards, or blinde Buzards, or idle-headed, or adle-brained, or arrant Beggars. That, like fooles as they are, professe to tell other men their fortunes, when they are ignorant of their owne; and promise to helpe them to hidden hords of gold, whom they beg a grey groate of: which groate, saith he, they may doe well first to take out of that hord, and then returne them the rest. Yet did not these also oftentimes proue true? yea did they not both proue alike true, both this and that other, when

Gerson de mag. error. par. 3. as Gods children haue beene somtime by true miracles and the predictions of Gods Prophets confirmed in their holy Faith: so such wicked Wretches may by counterfait miracles and diabolicall predictions be, with 
                     Exo. 7.11, 12, 13, 22. 
                  Pharao, hardned in their false beleife.
               And therefore, do we see such superstitious courses oft take effect, and to haue their euent answerable to their expectations that vse them? Let vs remember, that, as sin the more successefull it is, the more dangerous it is for the Sinner: so in this case,

                        gustinum, quanto sunt ad seducendum validiora. Idem de error. mag. part. 3. the oftner such courses take effect, the more perilous they are, because the more powerfull to preuaile, if we be not the wiser and the more wary, and in that regard the rather to be suspected and shunned of vs.
               Secondly by Gods speciall ordination and appointment, doe these things sometime so fall out, to worke his own ends by the wickednesse of others. For 
                     Operatur Deus per creaturam aliquando sine ipsa, aliquando contra ipsam, aliquando cum ipsa. Bern. de grat. &amp; lib. arb.
                   God worketh euen by them that worke contrary to him; and 
                     Eius enim consilijs militant, etiam qui eius consilijs repugnant. Greg. M. mor. l. 6. c. 14. they fight his battels, euen that fight against him.
               Now thus doth God giue successe to these things, though euill in themselues, and as they are vsed,

somtime for the punishment of those that deserue to be punished, &amp; his will is to haue either destroied or corrected; &amp; those either the vsers of them or others.
               The Vsers of them, as 1. Sam. 14.38, 39, 40. in the Lot cast by Saul that lighted on Ionathan,

                  We ought not in that regard to giue heed or credit to Lots in the like case (for how know wee that God hath still the like worke or end to worke; or that he is willing euer so to worke?) or to match it with that Lot that we read of in the

                  Againe sometime God giueth way and euent to these courses, for the manifestation of his owne glory, his power, and his prouidence; to let men see discouered to them by their owne proiects, though euill and impious, who it is that plagueth them, &amp; hath power ouer them, though they either know not, or acknowledge not him.

               § 10. To end where we began. 
                     Prou. 25.4. 
                  Take the drosse, saith Salomon, from the siluer, &amp; there will be a vessell sit for the siner. So take the ordinary abuse frō the ordinary Lot, &amp; it will proue an ordinance of no euil vse. Neither are the vse and the abuse of it so mixed together, but that men may, if they will, seuer them the one from the other. As for the extraordinarie Lot, the very ordinary vse of that Lot is a meere abuse of a Lot: and it is therefore, as drossie matter, that will not endure the Finers fire, but runneth all to smoake or ashes when it cōmeth to the assay, vtterly to be reiected. There may be superstition as wel in the condemning of the one, as in the approuing of the other. Let the one therfore go, as it well deserueth, to the dunghill: let the other be so wisely and warily vsed, that God be not dishonored, who hath giuen vs the free vse of them; nor our brethren offended or wronged, for whose good God hath giuen vs them; nor our selues hindred in better things, that more neerely concerne vs, and whereunto these things should be as furtherances vnto vs.
