            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            S. Paule to the Epheſians.
            You that haue profeſſed Chriſt, ſuffre not your ſelues to be deceyued vvith falſe doctrine, nor vaine and noughtie talkyng, but herken vnto all Godly thynges, and eſpecially too the doctryne of the Goſpell.
         
         
            
            
               THE HABOVNdaunt mercie and grace of our heauenly father Ieſu Chriſt, maye alwaies ſtrengthen and defende oute noble &amp; vertuous Prynce Edward too the maintenaunce of the liuely woord of God.
            
               
                  WHERE as manye hiſtories of olde &amp; auncient antiquitie, and alſo al godly &amp; Chriſtiāwriters moſt playnely conſēt together, and agree in this, that dignitie, riches, kinred, wordly pompe, and renoume, doo neither make men better, ne yet happiat, contrarie too the blynde &amp; fonde iudgement of the moſt part of menne: but by the power and ſtrength of the mynde, that is, learnyng, wyſedome,

and vertue, all menne are hyghly enriched, ornated, &amp; moſt purely beutified, for theſe bee thinges bothe notable, eternall, and verye familiar betwene the heauenly father &amp; vs. It is therefore euidente (moſt excellent Prince) that the fitteſt ornamētes for your graces tender age, bee, eruditiō and vertue. Wherunto you are bothe ſo erneſtly addicte and therin ſo wō
               derfully doo preuaile, that I nede not too exhorte &amp; exſtimulate your grace vnto the ſtudy thereof. For that God him ſelf hath wrought, and fourmed your mynde ſo apt and deſirous too attayne and diligētly too ſeeke for al godly doctrine, that euē now you doo ſhewe in all youre ſaiynges and dooinges ſuche a wonderfull pleaſaūres much lyke vnto a certayne ſwete muſike or harmonie, that any honeſt hart exceadinglye woulde reioyce in the ſight therof. Verely, your grace thinketh plainly all time loſt, that is not beſtowed vpon learnyng, which is a verie rare thyng in anye childe, and rareſt of all in a Prince. Thus youre noblenes, rather deſireth vertue and

learning the moſt ſureſt and excellent treaſures, which farre ſurmounte all worldly ryches, then anye vanities or trifles. Nowe youre grace prepareth for the holſome and pleaſaunt foode of the mynde. Now you ſeke for that whiche you ſhal fynd moſt ſureſt helper and faythfulſt councellour in all your affaires. Now your magnificēt mynde ſtudieth that, whiche all Englyſhe menne with meke and humile heartes ſhuld deſire GOD to endue your grace with all. Now with diligent labour you ſearche for a thyng, as one moſt myndeful of this ſaiyng: Happy is that realme thathath a lerned Prince. Nowe you trauaile for that, whiche conquereth, and kepeth doune all greuous tourmentes &amp; outragious affections of the mynde, too the furderaunce of good liuyng, and maintenaūce of vertue, I meane holſome erudition and learnyng. Many Heathen Princes forſoth, are highly magnified with moſt ample prayſes, which gaue them ſelues too the ſtudy of Philoſophie, or knowledge of tongues, for their owne commoditie, and

eſpecially for the weale of their ſubiectes. Who is nowe more celebrated and worthelier extoiled then Mithridares? that noble kyng of Pont and Bithinia, which, (as Aulus Bellius writeth) vnderſtoode ſo perfitly the languages of. xxii. ſondrye countries that were vnder his dominiō, that he neuer vſed any interpretour too anſwer his ſubiectes, but ſpake their lā
               guages ſo finelye, as thoughe he had been of the ſame coūtrie. Ageyn, that honorable manne Quintus Ennius ſaied: that he had. iii. heartes, becauſe he coulde ſpeake Greke, Italian, and Latin. Yea, and breuely, the moſt famaus writers, as well the Heathen, as the Chriſtien, with an vniuerſall conſent, playnly affirme: Whan thei had weied the nature and condiciō of the pureſt thinges vnder heauen, thei ſawe nothyng faire, or of any pryce, or that ought too be accōpted ours, but onely vertue and learning. Euen now too acknowledge that ſame, it is yeouē you from aboue, for your grace delecteth in nothyng more then too bee occupied in the holye Byble: wherin,

you beginne too ſauer &amp; ſmelle furth the treaſure of wiſedome, knowledge and fulnes of the deuyne power, that is a ſtudie moſt conuenient for euery Chriſtien Prince, that kynd of ſtudye cannot haue ſufficient laude and commendation. Whoſe Princely heart forſoth, is raueſhed on ſuche a godlie and vertuousſtudie, it can neuer haue condigne and worthie praiſes, but deſerueth alwaies too bee had in great price, eſtimation, and honour. Who dooeth not know? that Prince which is yeouen vnto the ſcriptures of God and with a ſtoute ſtomake and valiāt heart, both ſearcheth furth and alſo defendeth ye true doctrine of the Goſpell, too bee inrolled in the aſſemble of Chriſt. Who dooeth not ſee? that Prince too bee mooſt ſurelye armed, which carieth in his heart the ſwerd of ye ſpirit, which is the bleſſed woord of God. Who is ignoraunt? that euerlaſtyng lyfe conſiſteth in the knoweledge of God. What Prince woulde not ſtudie to maintaine that, which is written for the health, and ſaluation of all menne werynge with himſelfe

that a Prince can not deſerue, neither by conqueſt, ciuel policie, nor yet by anye other meane vnder heauen, thys name high or honorable, ſowourthely as by the ſetting forward of Goddes woorde. What young Prince humily deſendyng doune intoo him ſelfe and callyng to memory his bounden dutie woulde not with a glad hearte and a chearfull mynde, gredelye deſyre too knowe, enlarge, and amplifie the glory and maieſtie of hys derely beloued father? Your grace (forſoth) hath profeſſed God too bee your father: Bleſſed are you then if you obey vnto hys word, and walke in his waies. Bleſſed are you, yf you ſupporte ſuche as preache the Goſpell. Bleſſed are you, yf your mind bee full furniſhed with the teſtament of Chriſt, and ſhew your ſelfe too bee the moſt cruel foo and enemy agaynſt ypocriſie, ſuperſticion, and all papiſtical phantaſies, wher wt the true religion of God hathe been duſked and defaced theſe many yeres Bleſſed are you, if you reade it daye &amp; nighte, that your grace maye knowe what GOD dooeth forbyd you, and

euer ſubmit your ſelfe therunto with ſeruiceable lowlines chiefly deſiring to floryſh and decke your mynd with godly knowledge. And moſt bleſſed are you, if you apply your ſelf vnto al good workes, &amp; plant ſurely in your heart the ſcriptures of Chriſt, If you thus doo, nether the power of any papiſtical realme, nor yet of hel can preuaile at any time againſt your grace. Nowe therfore, with humile hearte, faithfully receiue the ſwete promiſes of the Goſpel. If you kepe the woordes of the Lorde and cleaue faſt vnto them: there is promiſed you the kingdome of heauen: You are promiſed a weale publick moſt riche and welthy You are promiſed too bee deliuered from the deceiptes of all youre priuie enemyes. You are promiſed alſo, too conquere great and mightie nations. Agayne, let your grace bee moſt fully perſwaded in this, that ther was neuer Kyng nor Prince, that proſpered whiche tooke parte againſt Goddes woord, and that the greateſt abhomination that can bee, either for Kyng, Prince, or any other manne, is too for

ſake the true woord of God. O with howe rebukefull woordes &amp; greuous iudgement thei be condemned, which diſpice &amp; ſet lytle by the holy Byble &amp; moſt beſſed Teſtamēt of God, wherin there is contained all the wil &amp; pleaſure of our heauēly father toward vs moſt miſerable &amp; ignoraunt wretches Who would not quake, too beholde the terrible feares &amp; threatenynges of God ageinſt al ſuche? Who would not lament &amp; gladly helppe their obſtinate blyndenes? Who woulde not weepe? to heare and reade in how many places, they be openly accurſed by the ſcriptures of Chriſt. God him ſelf playnely affirmeth, that he wyll ſodēly conſume them with the breath of his anger. Yea, beſides that whoſo euer declyneth from the word of God is accurſed in all his doynges, whether he be Kyng, or Prynce, riche, or poore, or of what eſtate ſoeuer he bee. This fearfull ſaiyng (moſt excellent Prynce) ſhulde moue all men to take hede vnto their duties and to praie that goods word maie take place emō
               giſt vs. O that al men would fantaſie

the ſcriptures of God, and ſaye wt the vertuous man Iob. Wee will not bee ageynſt the woordes of the holy one. Truth it is, God taketh diligent care too haue vs al know his woord. Woulde God therfore, that all wee were now willing to haue the ſyncere woord of God &amp; all holſom doctrine too go forward. O that all we would conſent togither in the Goſpell, brotherly admoniſhyng, and ſecretelye prouokyng one an other too true religion &amp; vertue. O that no man would ſow emongiſt the people pernitious doctryne, but with all lowly diligēce and Godlye monition euer prouoke, tempt, and ſtere them, tyll their heartes were remoued frō their olde dautyng dreames and ſuperſticiō, which haue been long grafted in them thorow popyſhe doctrine. By this meane wee ſhuld euer haue concorde emongiſt vs, whiche in all thynges is neceſſary, but moſt nedefull and expedient in Gods holi woord. Now truely the godlyeſt thynge that can bee deuyſed, for any chriſtian realme, is to haue emongiſt them one maner and

fourme of doctryne, &amp; too trace trueli the ſteppes of God and neuer to ſeeke any other by wayes. Who hath not redde in ye ſcriptures? but that realme is endued with godly ornamentes &amp; riches, where all men proſpere, go for ward and floriſhe in gods woord, delectyng day and night in the ſwete cō
               ſolations of the holy teſtament. By this way we ſhuld eſpecially ſetforth the glory of God, and of our ſauiour Ieſu Chriſt, if we would reuerently ſhew one an other that whiche God hath taught vs. Yea &amp; in this doyng all men ſhulde well perceaue that we were the true diſciples of Chriſt, being knitte and coupled faſt together in mynde and iudgement, preachyng God with one mouth and alſo with one aſſent euer promotyng his gloryous teſtament. O the good happe and grace of that king or prynce emongiſt whoſe ſubiectes there is ſuch an hole conſent and iudgement in the woord of God, for yt moſt aſſuredly byndeth &amp; adiuigneth ye hartes of al ſubiectes too their kyng. The ſtrength of the Goſpell is euen ſuche in this puincte,

that there was neuer man, which did humily receaue it, that would murmour ageynſt his Prince. It teacheth how wyllyngly all men ſhulde obey their kyng. It ſheweth verye lyuely and moſt apertly vnto euery man his ful dutie. It euer prouoketh vs from all wicked, curſed, and moſt obſtinate diſobedience. It euer inſtructeth men too ſhewe them ſelues moſt lowly, humile, and obeſaunt toward their Prynce. Whoſoeuer hath taſted fully therof, will declare hym ſelfe in al thynges, too bee a faithful ſubiect. Furthermore, it is clearer then the light (moſt vertuous prince) that it woulde make muche for the weale of this noble realme, yf all mē with heart and mynde, would nowe as well expulſe the pernitious and deuely ſhe doctryne af that Romiſhe biſhop, as his name is blotted ī bookes. There is none ſo ignoraunt, but he knoweth that thorough hym we were brought into a wōderful blindnes, thorough hym we did ſauer of nothyng, but of ſtynkyng Ydolatry, through hym we were deceiued with

falſe Ypocriſie. Now let euery blind ſtiffe hearted, and obſtinate creature compare his abhomination with the goſpell, and if he be not ſhameles, he will abaſhe to ſmell of his papiſtrie, and to walow ſtill in ignoraunce, vn leſt he bee priuely confederate and in heart conſent with the deteſtable felowſhip of al wicked papiſtes. Now would God all ſuche men would reduce ageyn their heartes vnto ye goſpell of Chriſt. would god they would bee prouoked by ſome meane to deſire knowledge. O that god woulde yeoue them a couragious mynde too reade the goſpel, there they ſhal ſone fynde all the venoume of the romiſhe ſort moſt playnely detected. Forſoth wee ſee dayly, yt lacke of knowledge of the goſpel maketh ſome buſſerdes runne hedlong on all rockes, daungers, &amp; extreme perilles: yea, and beſide that, olde popyſh doctryne whiche lyeth folded vp &amp; locked faſte in their heartes, doeth ſo ſore blynd thē that they haue neither fauour ne affectiō too printe in their myndes, the expreſſed coūcels, admonitions, and

preceptes of the holy ſcripture, but too ſtepe ſtil in their owne conceites, dreames, &amp; fonde phanſies. Wherfore let your dignitie note well this, that all thoſe whiche bee not wyllyng yt gods woord ſhould bee knowen, and that blyndenes ſhould be clean expulſed from all men, whiche be baptiſed in ye bleſſed bludde of Chriſt, bewray themſelues playne papiſtes: for in very deede that moſt deceatful wolfe and graund maiſter papiſt with his totiens quotiens, and a pena et culpa bleſſeth all ſuche as will bee blynde ſtil, maintaine his pōpe, drinke of his cuppe of fornication, truſt in his pardonnes, liue in popery, ypocriſie, and dānable ydolatrie, ſhut vp the kingdome of heauen, &amp; neuer regarde the goſpel. Cōtrarie too this, chriſt bi his holy Prophete calleth al thoſe bleſſed yt ſeke for his teſtimonies, al thoſe his elect &amp; choſē childrē, which turne frō ſynne, ypocriſie, &amp; ydolatrie, all thoſe goddes yt heare his word, yea, &amp; breuely, al thoſe which ſet it forward honorable mē. &amp; in this puincte your grace ſhoulde euer beare in mynde,

that noble and vertuous kyng Hezekiah, whiche ſhewed hymſelfe very honorable in ſettīg forward ye woord of God, and therby gotte hym glory and fame immortall, ſo that nowe he is moſt highly prayſed emongiſt all men. Ageyn his ſubiectes dyd obey his commaundement feynedly with Ypocriſie, but in their heartes they abhorred gods woord. O the miſerie that dyd afterwarde ſodeinly enſue vpon them, O the wonderfull wrath of God that was poured vpon them, O their great and obſtinate blindnes whiche cauſed them moſt greuouſly too be ſcourged: Their plage was no leſſe then too bee vtterly ſpoyled of their enemies, Their plage was no leſſe then to eate one an other: Yea, their plage was no leſſe then to eate their owne ſonues and doughters.
            This calamitie and ſorow (moſt noble prynce) happened them becauſe they dyd not regarde the lawes of God, but tourned too their olde abhominable Ydolatrie, and lightelye eſtemed gods holy woord. Wherfore euen now whoſoeuer is an enemie

to the holy Bible, that is, neither ſtudiyng it himſelfe, nor willyng that other men ſhulde knowe it, he can in no wyſe be a right chriſtian man: although he faſt, pray, doo almes, &amp; all the good workes vnder heauen. And he that hath ſuche a mynde, is ye moſt curſed and cruel enemie too god, a playne ſower of ſedition, and a deueliſhe diſquieter of all godly men. For truly thoſe that reade the goſpel of Chriſt, and labour diligētly therin: doo fynde wonderfull reſt &amp; quietnes, from all woofull miſerie, perturbatiō, and vanicies of this world. And ſurely none but ypocrites or els deuilles would go about too ſtoppe or allure men from ſuche a treaſure and godly ſtudy. And it were conuement, that all they whiche wyll remayne ſtyll necligent, ſtyffe, &amp; blind: ſhuld ſet before their faces the feare of paynes infernall, and if thei haue any grace at all, their ſpirites ought to be moued: too note the great plages that haue happened the ſlouthful in gods woord, &amp; thoſe that haue been ſtubburne ageynſt the ſettyng

out of it. There bee a thouſand recordes and examples in the holy Bible agaynſt ſuch as be farre wyde from knowledge, and lye now walteryng ſtyl in ignoraunce and will not looke vpon the bible. It woulde ſeme, they hope for a thyng, but their hope is in vaine: For ſaint Paule plainely writeth the hope of ſuche ypocrites ſhall coom̄ too nought. And too conclude (moſt honorable Prince) ſeeyng wee haue ſuche knowledge opened vnto vs, as neuer had engliſhe mē, and are clearly deliuered from the ſnares and deceiptes of al falſe and wicked doctrine, if we ſhuid not now thākefully receaue the goſpell, and ſhewe our ſelues naturally enclyned to ſet it forwarde, yea, and pray daye and night vnto God, for the preſeruatiō and health of the kynges highnes, your graces deare, and moſt entierly beloued father, we were neither true ſubiectes nor ryght chriſten men.
            Forſoth, through the abſolute wiſedome, and the moſt godly and politike prudencie of his grace, the ſwete ſounde of gods woorde is gone thorough

out all this realme, the holye Bible and bleſſed teſtament of oure ſauiour Chriſt are coom̄ne to lighte, and thouſandes haue faithfully receiued thoſe pleaſaunt, ioyfull, and moſt comfortable promiſes of God. Surely this thyng before all other, is acceptable too god. This thyng eſpecially ſwageth ye ite of god. This thyng in all holi ſcriptures god moſt chiefly requireth of his elect &amp; faithfull ſeruaūtes, euen too haue his lytell flocke knowe his bleſſed woorde, whiche woulde bee muche better knowē &amp; more thankefull i receaued, yf al agees and degrees of men with one mynd, wyll, &amp; voice, would nowe drawe after one lyne, leauyng their owne priuate affections, and ſhewe theim ſelues euer vigilant, prompt, &amp; ready helpers &amp; workers with God, (accordynge to the councell of ſainct Paule) &amp; eſpecially prieſtes, ſcolem it ſters &amp; parētes, which accordyng too ye Prophete Dauid are bleſſed, if they gladly require ye lawe of God. They ſhuld therfore reade ye bible &amp; purdge theyr mindes of al papiſtry: for theyr

necligence, in dooyng their duties &amp; ſlugiſhnes toward ye bleſſed woord of god, dooeth too muche appere.
            Through them forſoth the goſpel of Chriſt ſhuld bee moſt ſtrongely warded and defended, for almoſt all the Prophetes, and a great parte of the ſcripture beſide teache them their duties, and ſhew playnely what maner of men they ſhulde bee: Yea, and how greuouſly the holy Prophetes crie out vpon falſe and ignoraunt prieſtes, the thyng is very euident.
            But through the helppe of God all thoſe that be ignoraunt, or els learned (as they take them ſelues) wyll leaue of, and repent them of their wicked and obſtinate blyndnes, and bowe them ſelues with all oportunitie too draw mens heartes too the holy teſtament of God: conſideryng, yt in the terrible day of iudgement, euery mā ſhall yeoue accompte of his Beliwicke, where neither ignoraūce ſhall excuſe vs, ne yet any worldly pōpe may defēd vs. Moſt happye thē ſhall they bee, whiche haue walked tuſtely in the ſight of the Lorde, and

Auguſtine) ſhal fynde mercie at the handes of god, whiche haue entiſed and allured other vnto goodnes and vertue. Weiyng this with my ſelf, (moſt excellent, and vnto all kynd of vertues moſt prōpt &amp; preſtāt Prince) I thought it good too tranſlate this Dialoge, called the Epicure, for your grace: whiche ſemed too me, too bee very familiar, &amp; one of ye godlieſt Dialoges yt any mā hath writtē in ye latin tong. Now therfore I moſt humili praie, yt this my rude &amp; ſimple trāſlation may bee acceptable vnto your grace, truſtyng alſo yt your moſt approued gentilnes, wil take it in good part.

               The truth is (O Hedoni) I ſeke too haue knowledge of a thing, but as yet I cannot fynde yt whych maketh for my purpoſe.

               What booke haue you there in your boſome?

               It had bene farre more better for you, too haue ſought for the begynnynges of godly thynges, then the endes.
            
            
               SPVDE.
               Yea, but Marcus Tullius nameth ye the ende of godlines which is an exquiſite, a far paſſing, and a very abſolute goodnes in euerye puincte, wherein there is contained all kynde of vertu: vnto the knowledge ther of whoſoeuer can attaine, ſhuld deſire none other thīg, but hold himſelfe hauyng onely that, as one moſt fully content and ſatiſfied.
            
            
               HED.
               That is a worke of very great learning and eloquence. But doo you thynke, yt you haue preuailed in any thīg there, whereby you haue the rather

               SPE.
               I have had ſuch fruite and cōmoditie by it, that now verelye hereafter I ſhall doubt more of the effect and endes of good thinges, then I did before.
            
            
               HEDO.
               It is for huſbād menne too ſtande in doubt how farre the limittes and merebā
                  kes extend.
            
            
               SPE.
               And I cannot but muſe ſtyll, yea, and wonder very muche, why ther hath been ſo great controuerſie in iudgementes vpon ſo weightie a matter (as this is) emongiſt ſo well learned menne: eſpecially ſuche as bee moſt famous and auncient writers.
            
            
               HEDO.
               This was euen the cauſe, where the verite of a thyng is playne and manifeſt, cōtrarily, ye errour through

ignoraunce againe in the ſame, is ſoone great &amp; by diuers meanes encreaſeth, for yt thei knewe not the foundation and firſt beginnyng of the whole matter, they doo iudge at all auentures and are very fondly diſceaued, but whoſe ſentence thynke you too bee trueſt?
            
            
               SPE.
               Whan I heare MARCVS Tullius reproue the thyng, I then fātaſie none of all their iudgementes, and whan I heare hym agayne defende the cauſe: it maketh me more doubtfull thē euer I was and am in ſuche a ſtudie, that I can ſay nothyng. But as I ſuppoſe ye Stoickes haue erred the leſt, and nexte vnto thē I commend the Peripatetickes.
               
            
            
               HEDO.
               Yet I lyke none of their opinions

ſo well as I doo the Epicures.
            
            
               SPV.
               And emōgiſt all the ſectes: the Epicures iudgement is moſt reproued and condemned with the whole conſent and arbitreinēt of all menne.
            
            
               HED.
               Let vs laye a ſide all diſdayne and ſpite of names, and admitte the Epicure too bee ſuche one, as euery man maketh of hym. Let vs ponder and weighe the thyng as it is in very deed. He ſetteth the high and principall felicitie of man in pleaſure, and thiketh that lyfe moſt pure and godly, whiche may haue greate delectatiō and pleaſure, and lytle penſiuenes.
            
            
               SPV.
               It is euen ſo.
            
            
               HED.
               What more vertuouſer thyng, I praye you, is poſſible too bee ſpokē then this ſaiyng.
            
            
               
               Spu.
               Yea, but all menne wonder and crye out on it, and ſaye: it is the voyce of a bruite beaſt, and not of manne.
            
            
               Hedo.
               I knowe thei doo ſo, but the

                   erre in ye vocables of theiſe thinges, and are very ignoraunt of the true and natiue ſignifications of the woordes, for if wee ſpeake of perfecte thynges, no kinde of menne bee more righter Epicures, then Chriſten men liuing reuerētly towardes God and mā, and in the right ſeruice and worſhiping of Chriſt.
            
            
               SPV
               But I thinke the Epicures bee more nerer and agree rather with the Cynickes, then with the Chriſtien ſorte: forſoth ye Chriſtiens make them ſelues leane

with faſtynge, bewayle and lament their offences, and eyther they bee nowe poore, or elles theyr charitie and liberalitie on the nedye maketh theim poore, thei ſuffer paciently too bee oppreſſed of mēne that haue great power and take many wronges at their handes, and many men alſo laughe theim too ſkorne. Nowe, if pleaſure brynge felicitie wyth it, or helpe in anye wyſe vnto the furderaunce of vertue: we ſee playnly that this kynde of lyfe is fardeſt from al pleaſures.

               Heare nowe them, and beare awaye wyth you the ſaiynge of

               Ther is nothyng more miſerable then a mynd vnquiet &amp; agreued with it ſelfe.

               I like this ſaiyng well, but what doo you gather of it?
            
            
               HEDO.
               If nothing bee more miſerable thē an vnquiet mynde, it foloweth alſo, that there is nothing happiar, then a mynde voyde of all feare, grudge, and vnquietnes
            
            
               SPEV.
               Surely you gather the thing together with good reaſō but that notwithſtandyng, in what countrie ſhall you fynde any ſuch mynde, that knoweth not it ſelfe gyltie and culpable in ſome kynde of euell▪

               And I ſuppoſe there bee verye fewe, but that thei bee offēders in this thynge.
            
            
               HEDO.
               And in good ſoth I take it, that al thoſe yt bee purdged, are clere: whych wiped out their fautes with lee of teares, and ſaltpeter of ſorowfull repentaunce, or els with the fire of charitie, their offēces nowe bee not only ſmalle grefe and vnquietnes too them, but alſo chaunce oftē for ſome more godlier purpoſe, as cauſing thē too lyue afterward more accordyngly vnto Gods commaūdemētes.
            
            
               SPV.
               In deede I knowe ſaltpeter and lee, but yet I neuer hearde before, that faultes

haue been purdged with fire.

               Surely, if you go to the minte you ſhall ſee gould fyned wyth fyre, notwithſtādyng that ther is alſo, a certaine kynde of linē that brenneth not if it bee caſt in ye fyre, but loketh more whiter then any water coulde haue made it, &amp; therefore it is called Linum aſbeſtinum, a kynde of lynen, whyche canne neither bee quenched with water nor brent with fyre.
            
            
               Spu.
               Nowe in good faith you bring a paradox more wōderful then all the maruailous and profound thynges of the Stoickes: lyue thei pleaſaſauntly whom Chryſt calleth bleſſed for that they mourne &amp; lament?
            
            
               Hedonius.
               Thei ſeme too the worlde too mourne, but

verely they lyue in greate pleaſure, and as the commune ſaiynge is, thei lyue all together in pleaſure, in ſomuche that SARDANAPALVS, Philoxenus, or Apitius compared vnto them: or anye other ſpoken of, for the greate deſyre and ſtudy of pleaſures, did leade but a ſorowefull and a myſerable lyfe.

               And the Epicure hymſelfe, or elles I am diſceiued, would not clippe &amp; enbrace that pleaſure, whiche

               Thei waxe not rich, thei optein no promotiō, thei bā ket not, thei daūce not, thei ſing not, thei ſmell not of ſwete oynt mētes, thei laugh not, thei play not.

               We ſhould haue made no mention in thys place of ryches and prefermente, for they bryng wyth them no pleaſaunt lyfe, but rather a ſadde and a pēſiue. Let vs intreate of other thynges, ſuche as they chiefely ſeeke for, whoſe deſyre is to liue deliciouſly, ſee ye not daily drō

               Why ſo?
            
            
               Sp.
               For ther lacketh emongiſt thē ſobrietie of mind.

               For this is plaine that be twixt the mad mā &amp; the drūkerd ther is no diuerſitie, but yt ſlepe wil helpe the one his madnes, &amp; with much a doo ye cure of Phyſicions helpeth the other, but the foole natural differeth nothing frō a brute beaſt except by ſhape and portrature of body, yet thei

be leſſe miſerable whom nature hathe made verye brutes, then thoſe that walowe theim ſelues in foule and beaſtly luſtes.

               I confeſſe that.

               But now tell me, whether you thynke thē ſobre and wyſe, which for playn vanities and ſhadowes of pleſure, booth diſpice the true and godlye pleaſures of the mynde and choſe for them ſelues ſuche thynges as bee but vexacion &amp; ſorowe.
            
            
               SPV.
               I take it, thei bee not.
            
            
               Hedo.
               In deedethei bee not drūke with wyne, but with loue with anger, with auarice, with ambicion, and other foule and filthie deſires, whiche kynde of drunkenes is farre worſe, thē that is gotten with drinking of wine. Yet Sirus yt leude cōſpaniō
                  
of whom mention is made in ye commedie, ſpake witty thynges after he had ſlepte hym ſelf ſoobre, and called too memorie his greate and mooſt beaſtlye drunkenes: but the minde that is infected with vicious &amp; noughty deſire, hath muche a doo too call it ſelfe whom agein?
               How many yeares doeth loue, anger, ſpite, ſenſualitie, exceſſe, and ambition, trouble and prouoke the mynde? How many doo wee ſee, whiche euen from their youth, too their latter dais neuer awake nor repēt them of the drunkennes, of ambitiō, nigardnes, wanton luſt, &amp; riatte?
            
            
               Spu.
               I haue knowen ouermany of yt ſorte.
            
            
               Hedo.
               You haue graū
                  ted that falſe and fayned good

thinges, are not too bee eſtemed for the pure and godly.
            
            
               Sp.
               And I affirme that ſtill.
            
            
               Hedo.
               Nor that there is no true and perfect pleaſure, except it bee taken of honeſt and godly thynges.
            
            
               Spud.
               I confeſſe that.
            
            
               He.
               Then (I pray you) bee not thoſe good that the commune ſorte ſeeke for, they care not howe?
            
            
               Spu.
               I thinke they be not.
            
            
               Hedo.
               Surely if thei were good, they would not chaunce but onely too good men: and would make all thoſe vertuous that they happen vntoo. What maner of pleaſure make you that, doo you thinke it too bee godly, which is not of true &amp; honeſt thynges, but of de ceatfull: and coometh out of ye ſhadowes of good thynges?
            
            
               Sp.
               
                  
Nay in noo wyſe.
            
            
               He.
               For pleaſure maketh vs to liue merely.
            
            
               Spu.
               Yea, nothyng ſo muche.
            
            
               He.
               Therfore no man truely liueth pleaſauntly, but he that lyueth godly: that is, whiche vſeth and delecteth onli in good thynges: for vertue of it ſelfe, maketh a man to habound in all thynges that bee good, perfete, &amp; prayſe worthy: yea, it onely prouoketh God the fountaine of all goodnes, too loue and fauour man.
            
            
               SP.
               I almoſt conſent with you.
            
            
               HED.
               But now marke howe far they bee from all pleaſure, whiche ſeeme openly emongiſt all men too folowe nothyng, but an inordinate delectation in in thynges carnall.

Firſt their mynde is vile, and corrupted with the ſauour and taſte of noughtie deſires, in ſo muche yt if any pleaſaunt thing chaunce them, forthwith it waxeth bitter, and is nought ſet by, in like maner as where ye welle hed is corrupted and ſtynketh, there ye water muſt nedes be vn ſauery. Agein ther is no honeſt pleaſure, but that whiche wee receaue with a ſobre and a quiet mynde. For wee ſee, nothyng reioyſeth the angry man more, thē too bec reuenged on his offenders, but that pleaſure is turned into pain after his rage bee paſt, and anger ſubdued.
            
            
               Spu.
               I ſay not the contrary.
            
            
               He.
               Finally, ſuche leude pleaſures bee taken of fallible thinges, therefore

it foloweth that they be but deluſiōs and ſhadowes. What woulde you ſay furthermore, if you ſaw a mā ſo deceaued with ſorcerie &amp; alſo other deteſtable witchecraftes, eat, drynke, leap, laugh, yea, and clappe handes for ioye, when ther wer no ſuch thyng there in very dede, as he beleueth he ſeeth.
            
            
               Spu.
               I wolde ſay he were both mad and miſerable.
            
            
               Hedo.
               I my ſelf haue been often in place, where the lyke thyng hath been doone. There was a prieſt whiche knewe perfectly by longe experience and practiſe, the arte to make thynges ſeme that they were not, otherwiſe called, deceptio viſus,
               
            
            
               Sp.
               He did not lerne that arte of the holy ſcripture?
            
            
               Hedo.
               Yea, rather

of moſt popeholy charmes and witchecraftes: that is too ſaye, of thinges, curſed, dampnable, and wourthy too bee abhorred. Certayne ladies &amp; gentlewomen of the courte, ſpake vnto hym oftentimes: ſaiyng, they woulde coom̄ one day too his houſe and ſee what good chere he kept: reprouyng, greatly vile and homly fare, and moderate expenſes in all thynges. He graunted they ſhulde bee welcome, and very inſtauntly deſired them. And they came faſtyng becauſe they would haue better appetites. Whā they wer ſet to dyner (as it was thought) ther wāted noo kynde of delitious meat: they filled thē ſelues haboūdantly: after ye feaſt was

doone, they gaue mooſt hearty thanckes, for their galaunte cheare, and departed, euery one of them vnto their owne lodgynges: but anone their ſtomackes beganne too waxe an hungred, they maruayled what this ſhuld meane, ſo ſoone to be an hungred and a thirſte, after ſo ſumptuous a feaſt: at the laſt the matter was openly knowen and laught at.
            
            
               Spu.
               Not without a cauſe, it had been muche better for thē too haue ſatiſfied their ſtomackes at their owne chābers with a meſſe of potage, thē too be fed ſo delitiouſli with vain illuſiōs.

               And as I thīk ye cōmune ſort of men ar muche more too bee laught at, whiche in ſteede of Godlye thynges,

choſe vaine and tranſitory ſhadowes, and reioyce excedyngly in ſuche foliſhe phanſies that turne not afterwarde in too a a laughter, but into euerlaſting lamentation and ſorow.

               Go too, let vs graunt for a tyme theſe thynges too bee called pleaſaunt, that in very dede ar not. Would you ſaye that meeth were ſwete: whiche had more Aloes myngled with it, then honye?
            
            
               Spud.
               I woulde not ſo ſay and if there were but the third part of an ounce of Aloes mixt with it.
            
            
               Hedo.
               Orels, would you wiſhe to bee ſcabbed becauſe you haue ſome pleaſure too ſcratch?

               Noo, if I wer

               Their weigh with your ſelf how great peyne is intermyngled wyth theſe falſe and wrongly named pleaſures, yt vnſhamefaſt loue filthie deſire, much eatyng and drinking bring vs vnto: I doo omitte now that, which is principall grudge of cōſcience, enemitie betwixt God and mā, and expectation of euerlaſtyng puniſhēment.

               We ought to let paſſe and forbeare in this place auarice, ambition, wrath, pryde enuy; whiche of their ſelues bee heuy and ſorowful euylles and

let vs conferre and compare all thoſe thynges together, yt haue the name of ſome chief and ſpecial pleaſure: wher as the agew the hedache, the ſwelling of the belly, dulnes of witte, infamy, hurt of memory, vomyting, decaye of ſtomacke, tremblyng of the body ſuccede of ouer muche drynking: thynke you, that the Epicure would haue eſtemed any ſuche lyke pleaſure as thys, cōuenient and wourthy deſire?

               Noo, for after thei haue been often familiar with their pretyones, then they muſt goo ſtreighte too the barbours, that chaunceth continuallye vnto all whoremongers.

               Verely I had rather wāt them booth, for ther is no commoditie nor vantage

to bye pleaſure with payn but only to chaūg one thing for another, but the heit choiſe is nowe not too affectionate anye ſuch leudnes, for MAR. Tullius calleth that an inward greife &amp; ſorow.

               But now ye prouocation &amp; entiſemēt of vnleful pleſure, beſides that it is much leſſe then the pain which it bringeth with it, it is alſo a thing of a very ſhort time: but if the leproſye bee ones caught, it tourmēteth mē al their life daies very pitifully &amp; oftentimes cōſtraineth them to wyſhe for death before thei cā dye.

               Although there ſhoulde no pain com of it, I eſteme hym to bee a very fond occupier, which would chaūge precious ſtones for glaſſe.

               You meane that would loſe the godly pleaſures of the mynde, for the coloured pleaſures of ye body.

as too meaſure the felicitie and highe conſolation of manne, by the goodes of fortune, onely he is very poore, that is deſtitute and voyde of al grace &amp; vertue, and ſtandeth in boundage and debette, bothe of bodye &amp; ſolle vnto that tyranne oure mooſt foo &amp; mortall enemie the deuill.

               HE.
               Moreouer that man is ryche, whiche fyndeth mercye and foryeouenes at the handes of god. What ſhuld he feare, that hath ſuche a protectour? Whether men? where as playnely theyr hole power may leſſe do agaēſt God, then the bytyng of a gnat,

hurteth the Elephant. Whether death? truly that is a right paſſage for good men vnto all ſufficient ioy and perfection accordyng too the iuſt reward of true religion and vertue. Whether hell? For as in that the holy prophete ſpeaketh boldely vnto God. Although I ſhulde walke in the middeſt of the ſhadow of death, I wil not feare any euils becauſe yu art with me. Wherfore ſhulde he ſtande in feare of deuils, whiche beareth in his heart hym, that maketh the deuils too tremble and quake.
               For in diuers places the holye ſcripture praiſeth and declareth opēly the mynde of a vertuous man, too bee the right temple of God. And this to bee ſo true yt

               Adde this too it (if it pleaſe you) too bee a kyng, yea, or an emperour if you take away a quiet mynd with it ſelfe, I dare boldely ſay, that the poore man ſklenderlye

               That maye bee, for the immoderate vſe of leafull and godly games or paſtymes, is vnleaful: and if you wyll excepte this one thing onlye, in al other thei excelle whiche ſeeme too leade a paynfull lyfe, and whom we take too bee ouerwhelmed with all kynd of miſeries. Now I prai you what more roialler ſight can ther be, then ye cōtēplatiō of this world? and ſuch men as ye be in fauour of god keping his holy cōmaū

But the vertuous man with godly &amp; ſimple eyes beholdeth with an excedyng reioyce of heart the workes of his Lorde and father highly prayſyng thē all, and neither reprehēdeth nor

findeth faut with any of thē, but for euery thyng yeoueth moſte hearty thankes, when he conſidereth that al were made for the loue of man. And ſo in all thynges, he praieth vnto the infinite power, deuine wiſedome, &amp; goodnes of the maker, wherof he perceiueth moſte euident tokens in thynges that bee here created.

too drynke, but water, ſingle bere, or wyne well alayde, becauſe he taketh theſe thinges as prepared of God vnto all lyuyng creatures, and that they bee now yeouē vnto him of his gentyll and mercifull father, praier maketh euery thyng too ſauour well.
