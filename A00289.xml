A labour undertaken for the peace of all Gods people, and for a just condemnation of al those, that cause division, and offences, contrary to the doctrine and discipline of Christs Church.

            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            A VERY LIVELY PORTRAYTVRE OF THE MOST REVEREND ARCH-BISHOPS, THE RIGHT REVEREND Bs. OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND:
            Set forth in XX. irrefragable positions, concerning their Authority, power, and practise, as they onely are our Diocesan Lord Bishops, so grounded upon Scripture, Reason, and Experience, by evident demonstrative practises, as their troublesome opposites, may cleerely see, how greatly they are deceived in all these.
            A Labour undertaken for the peace of all GODS people, and for a just condemnation of al those, that cause division, and offences, contrary to the Doctrine and Discipline of CHRISTS CHURCH.
            Printed in the Yeare, 1640.
         
      
      
         
            
            
            
               THE NAME of Bishop is found in the New Testament, so as the controversie is not about the name, whether one may bee called a Bishop, nor whether Bishops in the true sense, have beene in the Church from the Apostles dayes, for this is fully agreed upon.
            But the positions following, and here handled, are such as have beene much controverted, but now so cleerely manifest, that every indifferent and impartiall judicious Reader, may discernt plainely on which side the truth is.
            
               POSITION 1. That Bishops jure Divino, are Superiours to other Ministers.
               
               1. BEcause our Saviour made severall degrees in the ministerie, which the Apostle mentioneth, Ephes. 4. 11. Yet in the same degree, he set none over another; not one Apostle over another, not one Evangelist over another; 
                     〈◊〉
                   not one Elder or Bishop over another.
               2. Because the Apostle in reckoning up the dignities. in the Ministery from Christ mentioneth no Bishops, as degrees in the ministery differing from the rest, but Apostles, 
                        〈◊〉
                     , Evangeliste which were extraordinary, then Pasters, and Teachers ordinary, Eph. 4 11.
               3. Because the name of Bishops, is given onely toThey have the same name. those who are called Eld

                   in Revel. 17. 12. that the ten hornes are ten Kings, which receive power as Kings at

                      with the Beast.
               
               2. Because they raigne as Kings, without the King; for.
               
                  1. They keepe their Courts, and Visitations without speciall patent under the broad Seale.
                  2. They print Articles upon their owne authority, and minister oathes upon them.
                  3. They send out processes in their owne name, and many other things they doe, contrary to the Statutes of the 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        , as hath by some learned in the Law beene fully proved; by which they doe rule over his Majesties good Subjects contrary to his Crowne and Dignity.
               
               3. Because Kings may very well and safely reigne without them; for
               
                  1. The Roman Emperours did reigne, a long time before there were any Lord Bishops.
                  
                  2. King

                      here the first Christian King reigned without them, and it was hee that made some Bishops, some Arch-Bishops, and not they him a King.
                  3. 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        , and others States in reformed Churches doe subsist without them, and cannot Kings be Kings without such Lord—like Bishops? they may if they have but eyes to see it.
                  4. As spirituall Lords, they have nothing to doe in Civill causes, and as they be Barons by their 
                        •…
                     
                     lities, they be made so great 
                        〈◊〉
                     , to live in super fluitie; and why should they supply the place of Temporall Lords? Is it not to the temporall Lords very disgracefull? yea is it not very ominous to a Kingdome? And this 
                        〈◊〉
                     , because against the holy order of Pastours, and against Christs owne words (it shall not bee 
                           〈◊〉
                         with you) they are lifted up to be 'Princes; busying themselves as busie-bodies in great affaires, which concernes them not, becomming ill Counsellours where they be, to the detriment of both Church and State; for they

are left of God to themselves, because they leave their sacred calling, as if it were too base for their high minds, and deep reaches in State businesses.
               
               4. Because Christian the third King of Denmark, our Kings great Grand-father by the Mother side, rooted out all the Bishops of his Kingdome in one day: as annoyance to the State, and have beene kept out now hitherto fully an hundred yeares; So as here, is a King, and no Bishop, and in Sweden, as I take it, no Lord Bishops, and yet there is 
                     〈◊〉
                   authority.
               5. Because our King, as King, hath no dependency of Bishops, but is over them, and they his Subjects, they depend upon him, and if they usurpe not their power, they have their Episcopall authority and jurisdiction from him, at whose pleasure they fall, if his Majesty please to 
                     〈◊〉
                   their authority, and to cast them out.
            
            
               POSITION 13. They stand wholly, for a learned, grave, paineful and godly ministery.
               
               
                  First, For a Learned Ministery.
                  For they have greatly pestered the Church.
                  I. In making many bare reading Ministers, to bee Curates, and too many to bee in the roome of Pastours, for they know well, that a Pastour must bee apt to teach, 1 Tim. 3. 2. as they say in his ordination, and doe give him authority to teach; they heare out of Gods word, that they are blind and dumb dogs, Esay 5. 6.
                  II. In tollerating them to be so continually, for they know where these be, the people are as Sheep without a Shepherd, Mat. 9. neither bee they ignorant of that which Solomon saith, where there is no vision there the people perish, Pro. 29. 18. nor of Christs speech, if the blind lead the blind, both fall into the ditch, Mat. 15. 14. in no

reformed Church in Christendome are such, but here, and in the Antichristian 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      of Sathan.
                  
                  3. In not consulting about meanes, and using the same to remove this so great a plague to the people, and to prevent it for the time to come.
                  4. In never rebuking their slothfolnesse, no not in the younger men, nor stirring them up to get knowledge, for to instruct the people,
                  5. In putting downe such divine exercises, as have beene used heretofore, when Ministers met and handled 
                        〈◊〉
                     , and the same piece of Scripture, the youngest beginning, and so successively to the Eldest; some grave Ministers being chosen as chiefe for the time; all this done publikely, and then in private, if any thing were needfull to be advised upon, or any mistake, to deliver their judgements upon it, and so appoint another day for the like meeting once in a fourthnight, or once a moneth; which exercise did much good to many, and continued in some market Townes heretofore very many yeares.
                  6. In comforting these blind Guides, by preferring prayer before preaching and common service to be such, as people should rest therewith satisfied, especially if they have their quarterly Sermons.
               
               
                  2. For a Grave Ministery.
                  Because they admit many too young men into the Ministery, if of any degree in Schooles, if they can answer some few questions in Latine, and can speake upon some text, it may be an houre before them, having penned it after their best hability, though they bevery ignorāt in the Scriptures, and little acquainted with the studie of Divinity; for in admitting of these they know what Saint Pauls Canon is, hee must not be a Novice, least hee bee puffed up in pride, and so fall into the condemnation of the Divell, 1 Tim. 3. 6. and they also know that youth is subject to be despised, 1 Tim. 4. 12. that many of these are vaine 
                        〈◊〉
                     , getting in to be some idle Curats, and giving themselves to liberty, till they enter

into the bond of marriage, and the next bond following 
                        〈◊〉
                      which 
                        〈◊◊〉
                     , and 
                        〈◊〉
                      then of children, a great disgrace to the Ministery.
               
               
                  3. 
                        〈◊◊◊〉
                     .
                  For that they are content that many teach negligently, but now and then, 
                        〈◊〉
                      not once a year, some once a yeare, some quarterly; some monethly, and some once in a fortnight, because they read that amongst the 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        , in the 
                        〈◊◊〉
                      Sabbath day was preaching, 
                        〈◊◊〉

                        〈◊◊〉
                      was Christs custome to preach every Sabbath, Luke 4. 16, and the Apostles in the Jewish

                     ; ancient Fathers used

                        •…
                     . 
                        〈◊〉
                      yet 
                        〈◊〉
                      this 
                        〈◊〉
                      them not, because they find it written, 
                        
                           〈◊◊〉
                         are destroyed for want of knowledge; because 
                           〈◊◊◊◊〉
                        , I will also reject thee, that thou shalt

                      4. 6.
                  2. They themselves (the most of them) are evill examples, for they lay aside preaching for the most part, as if it were either no part, or the least part of their dutie.
                  3. Though in 
                        〈◊〉
                      Ministers they charge upon them this dutie, and have made a 
                        〈◊〉
                      for a licensed Preacher to preach every Lords day; yet is there no enquirie after Ministers negligence herein, no calling them to their Courts, no

                     , no suspension,

                      the same. Because they read that

The like did Festus, Acts 25. 5. who said, it was the manner of the Romans so to doe, verse 16. and King Agrippa approved thereof, Acts 26. 1. none of them willing to have him put to his oath, that so advantage

               But here note,
               
                  1. It passed without the consent of the Commons who greatly repined against it.
                  2. Authority given to presse this oath, and for Prelates and Ordinaries to fine and imprison the K. Subj. was held abloudie Law.
                  3. Aboundance of Christian bloud was shed by the enacting of this cursed Law.
                  4. Gods judgements followed hereupon, and were laid to heart by the State.
                  5. Hereupon the Statute of imprisoning, and the oath ex officio was made void; And though in K. Phil. and Mar. 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , a Statute was made according to that of Hen. 4. yet in the 1. of Eliza: it was repealed.
               
               Obj. In the Starre Chamber and Court of Chancery, there is an oath required.
               Answer. This is by laying in of a Bill of complaint, in which a legall accusation is framed against the partie; beyond which, the plaintiffe cannot goe, nor the defendant shall be urged.
               But this oath ex 
                        〈◊〉
                     , is first given to the partie to answere he knowes not to what, then is hee examined

upon either flying reports, or secret witnesses, or upon some illimagination against the party, which dealing carryeth no shew of civill Law, and is flatly repugnant (saith the Lord Verulam) to the Common Law.
               
                  Obj. Some alledge that by this oath none are tyed to answer further then they are bound by Law.
               
                  A. 1. They have no Law to put men to such an oath, no Law of God, no Law of this Land, and therefore none are tyed to take it, nor bound by Law to make any answere to it at all.
               2. In answering, if they plead the benefit of the Law, that they are not bound to accuse themselves, if the interrogatories and Articles doe seeme, to touch the betraying of themselves, then they use captious questions, and doe take it as for granted, that the partie is a delinquent, in such Articles as he will not make answer unto; so though it be said, you shall sweare as 
                     〈◊〉
                   as the Law onely bindeth, yet these bee but sugered words, to draw men into a snare, and to make the simple beleeve that they may take the oath, and the other may impose it.
               
                  Obj. They would faine have warrant from the Scripture, and so to have God to approve of them, for this purpose, they doe alledge, Ex. 22. 11. Num. 5. 19.
               For the place in Exod. 22. 11. Then shallan oath of the Lord be betweene them both, that he hath not put his hands unto his Neighbours goods, &amp;c. This warrants not the wicked administring of the Oath ex Officio.
               
               
                  1. Here is one standing forth and bringing the party before authority; In the Oath ex officio, no accuser sometimes commeth in sight, nor will such a one bee made knowne.
                  
                     2. Here the matter is well knowne, before the party be put to sweare.
                     In the other, he is inforced to sweare, before hee know what he is to sweare unto, and if hee refuse, hee is of their loving kindnesse and compassion sent into prison.
                  
                  
                     
                        3. Here the matter is of common equity, and a 
                           〈◊〉
                         civill businesse, concerning right betweene party and party.
                     There it is about causes Ecclesiasticall and criminall matters, and not ever betweene party and party in a matter of 
                           〈◊〉
                         justice.
                  
                  
                     4. Here the oath is administred in a case, not otherwise to be tryed and decided, for if it could, say the Hebrew Doctors, the Oath was not to be administred.
                     There its administred, whether it can, or cannot bee otherwise proved.
                  
                  
                     5. Here the Judges proceed, in the behalfe of the party complaynant, to end the 
                           〈◊〉
                         betweene them.
                     In the other, the Judges proceed with relation to themselves, secretly becomming parties, not to end a 
                           〈◊〉
                         betweene others, but to begin it betweene the party and themselves too often.
                  
                  
                     6. Here the Oath is administred, not ex Officio, upon the Judges pleasure, and their owne authority, but upon the just complaint of another.
                     In the other ex Officio, is a proceeding upon their owne authority, and the framing of a bill upon their owne imagination against the party called before them, letting the wicked accuser lurke in a corner, or else to be gone, till they can ripen the 
                           〈◊〉
                        .
                  
                  
                     7. Here is an Oath given to make an end of the controversie; to cleare the party, and the 
                           〈◊〉
                         to rest satisfied.
                     In the other the Oath ex Officio, is to begin a controversie, not to cleare the party, but 
                           〈◊〉
                         breed him more and greater trouble, for they will not be satisfied, though they have no just matter against him, but if they let him depart, its by making him enter into a bond of appearance againe, whensoever they 
                           〈◊〉
                         call him.
                     Lastly 
                           〈◊〉
                         the Oath is administred onely touching the particular cause in hand. That is administred upon many captious interrogatories, that by all or some of them,

the party may be catched, and brought into danger.
                  
               
               Wee see from all this, that hence is no 
                     〈◊〉
                   for their wickednesse, but is rather against them.
               Touching the other Scripture, though in a criminall cause of adultery, Numb. 5. 19. yet it helpes them nothing, thus to tyrannize over Ministers and others.
               
                  1. It was a Law (all the circumstances and meanes used) peculiar to the Iewes, because of the mans jealousie against his wife, to satisfie him to prevent further mischiefe; but with us no such meanes is allowed to satisfie the jealousie of the Husband against his wife.
                  2. This was to take an Oath against her selfe; which our Law alloweth not.
                  3. Here the Oath, was not a bare Oath, but 
                        〈◊〉
                      Oath of cursing, to which he was to say Amen, Amen, such a kinde of Oath we use not to 
                        〈◊〉
                     .
                  4. Besides the Oath with a curse, other meanes were used, by which the truth should bee made undoubtedly to appeare, as the Text doth shew, so as the taking of an Oath in a matter of such 
                        〈◊〉
                     , served not the turne, to take away the Husbands jealousie.
                  5. In this case, the woman found guilty 
                        〈◊〉
                      plagued of God; but if she were 
                        〈◊〉
                      shee received a blessing from God, verse 28.
               
               Lastly yet this was not allowed to be done by the Lord, but when there was no witnesse against her, or shee 
                     〈◊〉
                   taken in the fact, verse 13.
               These holy 
                     
                        〈◊◊〉
                     
                   are therefore 
                     〈◊◊〉
                  , to make God speake for them, who, as I have proved, is 
                     〈◊〉
                   them.
            
            
               The Conclusion.
               IT cannot be sufficiently admired, in these 
                     〈◊〉
                   distracted dayes, that Bishops the Reverend Fathers in our Church, should be from time to time so opposed, as they

have beene. First they have beene prayed against. Second preached against. Thirdly written against. Fourthly witnessed against, by suffering persecution, suspension, excommunication, deprivation, degradation, also whipping, pillory, the cropping off of the eares, the flitting of Noses, fining deepely, and imprisonment unto death. Fiftly, &amp; I hope lastly resisted with the sword, as if men desired and intended wholy the rooting out of those so eminent persons, from the Churches of Christ, as if Enemies to peace, to preaching, to the power of godlines &amp; all goodnes, and as if they were lyms of that Romish Antichrist, Lovers of that

               But for better discoverie of the truth, here is laid before every judicious Reader, their way and walking, that all may see that will see, and not mistake, but bee inforced to acknowledge them to be such, as they are before the face of God, and all good men, who can truly judge aright betweene them, and all those which so condemne them.
               It cannot be denyed that they prove themselves to be Bishops, Superiours to Elders in dignity, from Ti

                  Bishops; This is their divine ground on which they build their worthy standing, and well may they. For they follow all the rules and exhortations given to these two Bishops by Saint Paul very exactly, and punctually to every thing, being strongly fenced with Saint Pauls authority in all their doings.
               1. They conceive Bishops to be superiours in office, and dignity, to Elders.
               
               
                  For they read that Saint Paul maketh Bishops and Elders all one, Tit. 1. 5. 7. 1 Tim. 3. 1. as the fo

               But they 
                     〈◊〉

                     : in his describing of a Bishop, in 1 Tim 3. 1. and in Tit. 1. 7, 8. 9. no one word is there of iurisdiction.
               3. They challenge ordination to themselves, imposition of hands and making of Ministers.
               For they find it written, that imposition of hands was in the

                        〈◊〉
                      LordBishops deserve their honour, that they walke worthy their places, and are to bee maintained for Churches wellfare, and the common wealths happinesse, till AntiChrists downefall, and the utter ruine of Rome, which all Christians have good cause to pray for, especially if

wee take into our wise consideration these few things in briefe.
               1 That all their proceedings are by booke, even altogether contrary to that which is written, as hath been declared.
               2. That they make Canons such as they please, and without confirmation by act of Parliament, and yet violently urge them, as Law, upon his Majesties Subjects, and doe frame Articles out of them by oath to be observed.
               3. That whatsoever in the Statute Lawes, or in their owne Canons they find usefull for themselves, in their way they diligently bend themselves, to have them carefully observed, but as for all the rest, which perhaps may be such as tend to true pietie, sound doctrine, faithfull discharge of good duties to God, and to man, and for an holy lise and conversation, they farre lesse regard, and for the most part passe them over.
               4. That in afflicting punishments there is more respect to the persons hability, what he is able to pay, then the amendment of his life, the Lord knowes it.
               5. That they generally suffer foule abuses in the Church, not conscionably seeking a redresse thereof, which yet are in their power to reforme, if they would seriously as in Gods presence, take it into hand, and let petty matters alone, and fall upon the removing of greater enormities, even raigning sinnes which provoke God to wrath, in all sorts of persons; both of the higher degrce (commonly let alone) and of the lower ranke medled with onely for the purse sake.
               6. That they notoriously abuse generally all the people of the Land with the name of the Church of England, undor which name they countenance themselves, their Prelaticall power, and their owne sole doings, which few take notice of, but all may easily observe it in their proceedings, both before the convocation gathered, in the time of the convocation, and after its broken up.
               
                  
                  Before the Convocation.
                  1. One, the greatest, which aweth all the rest, with the assistance of two or three Lording Spirits (such as care not to turne all upside downe, so they may be sure to hold their standing) consult of matters which they hold most fit, and having concluded what to do within themselves, they propound them to the rest of the Bishops their fearfull brethren, who dare not but say as they say, when they meet together, thus the Church beginneth.
                  2. To further their designes, Clarkes in the Countrie, for the Convocation house must be chosen, but not freely by the Ministers as they ought, but picked out by the Bishops in their owne diocesse, such as they know will bee sure cards for them, and propound them to be chosen of the over-awed Parsons and Vicars who dare not for their cares gainesay them: and thus the Bishops make up a Parke for their Lord-ships purposes: having made ready their Clarkes, they call together their su pporters, all the D

Thus they (the Church forsooth) goe to lay a sure foundation for themselves, before the Convocation be brought together.
                  3. But here note, that the Church consists of the Laity, as well as of the

                  In the time of their sitting.

se are so seiseth upon almost all of them, as thereby thy are moved to agree to contradict nothing; but if it so happen that some take courage (a rare vertue among them) for the truth, and doe oppose in some materiall things, which crosse their Lordly designements, Then,
                  3. Either they labour by a strong side, and more in number (for the greatest and most are not ever the best) to make them yeeld, or to say nothing: or else (to get their Canons passe) They devise a time, when the better sort, al or most, are away, to finish the worke, &amp; thus the Church of England makes here decrees to all her beloved children, but yet are of no force without an act of Parlament:
                  
               
               
                  After the Convocation is dissolved.
                  1. If any matter be not onely in shew questionable, but is justly to bee questioned, their Lordships by their sole wisedome in their severall di

                  2. If in time the One great one, and some two three, or foure bethinke themselves of any course better befitting their secret plots and intentions, in altering, in adding, or taking from, in any innovation whatsoever, then they have wayes to beare out all these their doings, with gaining help of Royall declarations, and proclamations to beare them out, which being setled in peace, then they become the orders allowed by the Church.
                  And thus may all wise men see, who are this Church of England; one with two, three, or foure of the diocesan Lord-Bishops, for they find it written, (with clipping the text) that if two of them, much more three or foure, with a body of Cyphers, be gathered together and agree in the Convocation house touching any thing, it shall be done.

            Twenty irrefragable POSITIONS.
            
               1.
               THat Bishops Jure divino, are superiours to other Ministers.
               2.
               They are Diocesan Bishops by divine right.
               3.
               They are worthily called Lord Bishops.
               4.
               They may very well busie themselves in civill affaires, and sit in Courts of Iustice
               5.
               They need not preach often; but seldome or never, if they please.
               6.
               They are Priests and may be so rightly called. Though they be Bishops, yet they forget not their Priesthood, but will be called Priests.
               7.
               They stand for, and d

                  c maintaine all Ceremonies upon very good grounds.
               8.
               They judge it necessary that what soever is amisse in the Church, should be carefully and speedily reformed, and this is evident to all.
               9.
               They may very well rule by their sole power alone.
               10.
               Their high authority so lawfull, they all obtaine by very lawfull meanes.
               11.
               They may not forsake their sowarrantable Lordly Prelaticall standing.
               12.
               No Bishops, no King, this is undeniable.
               13.
               They stand wholy for a learned, grave painefull and godly ministery.
               14.
               They hate to flatter the King.
               15.
               They greatly further the peoples knowledge in divine things,
