            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            ¶Ʋnto the right noble
William Marques of Northhamton,
Earle of Eſſex &amp; lorde
Par, your aſſured louyng frēd
Fraunces Briant knight, one
of the kynges moſt honorable
preuy Chamber, deſireth
to you perpetuall
health and honor.
            
               
                  IT IS not
lōg agone
(my verye
ſynguler
good lord)
that I foūd
you loking
in a lytell
boke called in the Frenche language
Meſpriſe de la court, et
lalouāge de la vie ruſtique, whiche
is to ſaye in Engliſhe, the
Diſpraiſe of the Courte, &amp; the

laude of the ruſtical life. And
when I demaūded of you what
boke it was, after your accuſtomed
gentlenes, you were cō
               tented
that I ſhould for ye tyme
haue it, and loke on it, and I ſo
doyng: after that I had in part
ouerſene it, I do enſure you I
toke great pleaſure therin, and
not without good reaſon, foraſmuche
as the matter was not
onely pleaſaunt and fruitfull,
but alſo full in euery where of
olde auncient ſtories and wyſe
ſaiynges of the noble and notable
Philoſophers &amp; clerkes.
And at our nexte metyng together,
partly at your requeſt I
promiſed to turne theſame out
of Frenche into our maternall
tong, whiche you right wel accepted.
And ſo at conuenient

layſure (as ye may ſee) I haue
finiſhed theſame, praiyng your
good lordſhip to take my pore
labor in gre, yt not only in ſuche
a trifle as this is, but in any
thyng els that I may do you
ſeruice and pleaſure in, ye ſhal
fynde me as mooſt bounden, euer
preſt and redy aſwel for the
great goodnes ſhewed vnto me
by your mooſt wiſe father duryng
his dayes whom I toke
as a ſpecial patron: But further
hauyng reſpecte to your
moſt noble ſiſter, my moſt good
and gracious lady the Quene,
I thynke me fortunate to employ
my poore engyn to that yt
to her highnes or to your good
lordſhip ſhould ſeme either acceptable
or agreable. This litle
boke then, lette it come into

light vnder your proteccion.
And in ſuche wyſe that if that
ye thynke I haue erred in the
tranſlacion, not to impute it to
bee ſo dooen for lacke of good
wyll and louyng heart that I
owe vnto you, but for lacke of
knowlage of the ſtories, which
I do profeſſe is hard for to vnderſtand
for one of no greatter
litterature then I profeſſe me
to be. Thus almightie God
ſende you well to fare, and to
proſpere in honor more &amp; more
to ye cōforte of al your frendes,
and me, that to my power ye
may aſſuredly nomber me
among that ſorte.
         
         
            
            To the right reuerende
and worthy Prelate my lorde
Willyam de Prat biſhop of
Cleremoūte, Antony Alaygre
ſendeth gretyng.
            
               
                  IT IS not many
daies paſt ſithēs
I beyng retyred
for a tyme (my
good lord) into ye
village, and there takyng the
commoditie and pleaſure of the
fayre ſwete fieldes, a certaine
frende of myne ſent vnto me a
worke in the Caſtilian rong of
the lorde Antony of Gueuera
biſhop of Mondouent, &amp; Chronicler
of the Emperour: in readyng
whereof I founde great
pleaſure and profite. The title
of the boke is the Diſprailyng
of the Court, and the Praiſe of

the life ruſticall, dedicate vnto
the kyng of Portingal in ſuche
ſort, that the better to kepe and
to hold the wiſe ſentence &amp; erudicions
therin cōteined, I employed
certaine houres after
ſupper to trāſlate theſame into
Frenche, not thinkyng among
mine other ſimple workes euer
to put it abrode, but after that
I had cōmunicat ye ſame with
ſome of my frendes that haue
knowledge of the Spaniſhe
tong, to leaue it in a corner to
make it meate for Rattes and
Miſe. Now for trueth, the firſt
exempler was ſo euil deuided,
and the leaues ſo out of order
that I gaue charge to ye Scriuener
that was my nye neighbour
to copye them, &amp; as who
ſhould ſay to write it faire and

in order, the whiche ſo euil went
about it, a
                  •••
               ough by ignorāce
he could not enſue ye originall,
yet for to gette a litle money he
ſolde where his pleaſure was ye
copies ſo vncumly ſet together
that I was ſory and repentant
that euer I conſumed the tyme
to trāſlate it, till at the laſt moued
by the perſuaſiō of Annas
Regyn Vicar generall, and by
Peter Ciſter your aduocate, by
them twaine my great frendes,
I thought it better to preſente
to the eyes of all men this euil
tranſlated, then to ſuffre lenger
thoſe euil exemplers ſo corrupted
to my blame in ye hādes of
thoſe that haue no right iudgement,
to know from whom the
faute came: wherfore my good
lorde, vnder your prudent fauor

&amp; correccion I do aduēture
herein my name and fame accordyng
to my knowlege, truſtyng
aſſuredly that your only
name ſhal ſuffiſe to vanquiſhe
and ſet aſide this ſlaunder, the
whiche ſlaunder as enemie to
learned men, ſeaſe not to withdraw
thoſe that haue good wil
and minde to ſtudie: I ſay this
that as me ſemeth it is well
worthie that worke of the wyſe
biſhop of Spayne be preſēted
to his ſemblable or ſuperior in
learnyng in Fraunce, or rather
aboue him in knowlege &amp; vertuous
maners. I will adde to
to this, that the graue ſentēces
&amp; perſuaſion to vertuous life
conteined in this boke deſerue
to be offred to you that are accuſtomed
to vſe thē after ſuche

ſorte ye euery man haue plaine
opinion of you that ye are ſent
of God to be protector and patron
of vertue, troubled &amp; diſpiſed.
Therfore (my ſinguler
good lorde, as one of ye chiefeſt
of the beſt ſorte) I dedicate to
you this my litle laboure, not
that I thinke it worthy to cum
into your handes, but for to be
a perpetuall witnes that I do
owe vnto you my ſeruice with
all reuerēce, to the whiche moſt
humbly I recommende me.
            
               From your cytie of Cleremonte

of Maye. Anno. M.D.xlii.
               
            
         
      
      
         
            
A diſpraiſe of the life of
the Courtier, and a cōmendacion
of the life of the huſbandman, compoſed
in the Caſtilian toungue by the reuerēd
father in God the lord Antony of Gueuera
biſhop of Mondouent and Chronicler to
the Emperour Charles. And out of Caſtilian
drawen into Frenche by Antony

Frenche toungue into our maternal
lāguage, by ſir Fraunces
Bryant knight, one
of the kynges moſt
honorable chambre.
         
            The firſt Chapiter.
            ¶ Of certaine courtiers whiche
ought to complaine of none,
but of them ſelues.
            
               AFter that the noble
prince Philippe
of Macedony
had ouerrunne
the Athenience,
on a tyme
he beyng at ſupper amonges
certaine of his Philoſophers,

aſked theim whiche was the
greatteſt thyng in the worlde?
One of them anſwered, that to
his thinking it was the water,
becauſe there was more of that
onely then of any other thyng
vnder the ſkye. Another ſayd
it was the Sunne, ſeyng his
only brightnes doeth ſuffiſe to
geue light to the yearth, to the
ſtarres, and to the water. Another
ſayd it was the great hill
Olympe, whoſe heigth paſſeth
the cloudes. Another ſayd it
was the moſt renoumed gyant
Athlas, on whoſe ſepulcre was
builded the feareful mountain
Ethna. Another ſayd it was
Homer, that in his life was ſo
much praiſed &amp; after his death
ſo muche bewailed, yt vii. great
cities made warre amōges thē
               
ſelfes for ye recouery of his bones,
to kepe theim as a relike.
The laſt &amp; moſt wiſe Philoſopher
ſayd, that nothing in this
world ought to be calledgreat,
but that heart whiche eſtemeth
no great thinges. O high and
noble ſētence, ſince that by that
it is geuen vs to vnderſtande,
that as touchyng the riches &amp;
honor of this worlde, more is ye
glorye of him that ſettes light
by theim, then he that hath the
the caſt for to get theim. Titus
Liuius praiſeth and neuer ceaſſeth
to praiſe, the good conſull
Marcus Curius in the houſe of
whom, came Ambaſſadours of
the Sannytes for to recouer
certaine landes that he had of
theirs, offeryng to him for the
ſame plentie of golde &amp; ſiluer:

He hauyng in his hand certain
herbes to put in his pot for his
diner, anſwered them after this
ſort, ye ſhuld haue offered this
money to the Capitaines that
diſdaines to dreſſe their owne
diners, and not to me that deſireth
no greater riches them to
be lorde ouer their lordes.
            Deſerued not more praiſe this
Marcus Curius in ſettyng light
thoſe talentes of golde of the
Sannytes, then the Conſull
Lucullus for robbyng theim of
Spartes? Deſerued not more
glorie the wiſe Crates for the
riches that he caſt into ſea, their
the kyng Nabugodonoſer for
the treaſure that he robbed frō
the Temple? To your iudgement,
did not they of the Iſles
of Bariares deſerue more honor,

agreyng not to haue amōg
theim neither golde nor ſiluer,
then the couetous Grekes that
toke by force &amp; pilled ye mynes
of Spayne? Was not more
greater the heart of the good
Emperour Auguſtus in ſetting
light the Empire, then of his
vncle Iulius Caeſar that did take
poſſeſſiō? It is nedeful to haue
wyſedome, experience to order
it, cunnyng to ſet it furth, &amp; fortune
to bryng it to good ende:
but to vpholde it and kepe it,
had nede of great ſtrength, and
for to diſpraiſe it, a good heart,
becauſe that which is ſene with
the eyes is more eſier to diſpraiſe,
then that thyng whiche
we haue already in our hādes.
It hath been ſeen that many
noble men hath had fortune ſo

muche at their deſires that thei
haue enterpriſed a thing almoſt
impoſſible to attaine, ye whiche
after for lacke of good diſcrecion
wer not able to kepe it.
            Wherby it is to be vnderſtāde
that the greatnes of the heart
doeth not cōſiſt ſomuche in obteinyng
the thing that we deſire
to haue, as it is to ſet light,
&amp; contemne that that one loues
beſt. Apolonius Thyaneus, did
he not diſpiſe his owne proper
countrey &amp; trauailed thorowout
all Aſia for to go to ſee the
Philoſopher Hyarchis in Y
                  ••
               e?
Ariſtotle leauyng the familiacitie
he had with Alexander, returned
to his owne houſe for to
rede Philoſophy. N
                     •••••
                  s nothing
extemed the treaſure that
the great king Cyrus gaue him

for to folowe him in ye warres.
The Philoſopher Anatillus refuſed
thre times ye principalitie
of Athenes, ſaiyng: he had rather
be ſeruaūt to ye good, then
a chaſtiſer of the euil. Cecilius
Metellus a valiaunt capitaine
Roman, neither would accepte
the eſtate of Dictator that to
him was geuen, nor ye office of
Conſull that to him was offered:
ſaiyng, that he would eate
in reſt, that whiche with great
trauail he had gotten in ye war.
Themperour Dyoclecian (as
it is manifeſt) forſoke with his
free wyll the Empire, for no other
cauſe, but to fle the brute
of the cōmon ſpeche, and to liue
in reſt at home. Worthy is he
to be praiſed that hath ye harte
to care litle for an Empire or a

realme: but yet more is he worthy
that can ſette light by him
ſelfe and not to be gouerned by
his owne will: for there is no
man in this worlde, but that he
is more in loue with that he deſireth,
then with yt he hath: but
howe coueteous or ambicious
ſo euer any mā be, if he trauail
x. daies for that which he hath,
he will beſtowe an hundreth to
obtain that whiche he deſireth,
becauſe that we do not beſtow
our labor as we ſhuld, but we
ſtowe it after our deſires. If
we do trauaile, if we be troubled,
if we cannot ſlepe, it is not
for neceſſitie, but for to ſatiſfie
our wil and appetite. And that
is worſt of all, we not contentyng
our ſelfes wt that we can:
do procure to can that that

we deſire. O how many haue
we ſeen in the court of princes,
to whom it had been better for
them that thei had been no lordes
of their will, &amp; leſſe of their
deſires, becauſe ſythens they
did that they might &amp; deſired,
begon to do that thei ought not
to do? If the man ye offēdes vs
ought to aſke pardon, let euery
mā aſke pardon to himſelf before
any other, for in my life I
found neuer none yt hurte me ſo
muche as my ſelf, I haue been
only the procurer of mine own
hurt. Who made me fall into
pryde, but mine only preſumpſion
and fondnes? Who durſte
haue priſoned my ſorowfull
heart with enuye, but lacke of
naturall gouernement? who
durſt haue inflamed myne inwardes

with the fyer of yre, if
it had not been my great impacience?
what is the cauſe I am
ſo great a gurmander, but that
my bringyng vp was to delicate?
what is the cauſe I haue
not departed with my goodes
to the poore and nedye, but the
exceſſiue loue I had to my riches?
who gaue leue to my fleſh
to riſe againſt my foliſh deſire,
if my heart had not been fixed
in voluptuous pleaſures? O
my ſoule, of all this domage &amp;
open faultes, to whom do you
lay ye blame, but to myne owne
ſenſualitie? Great folly it is, ye
thefe beyng within the houſe, to
ſeke for him without: euen ſo it
is with vs a manifeſt faulte of
experiēce, when ſeyng in vs the
blame, and yet charge another

with the occaſion: by this we
ought to perceiue that we ſhall
neuer ceaſe to complaine vntil
the tyme we begyn to amende.
Oh, howe often &amp; many tymes
hath vertue fought with the
botome of our cōſciences, whiche
ſtirred vs to be good, and
our ſenſulitie reſiſted, whiche
is vaine frowardnes, by the
which battail folowed a darke
corrupte iudgement: but to cō
               clude,
we of oure ſelues as of
our ſelues are very miſerable.

            If to Suetone, Zantippe and
Plutarch we will geue credite &amp;
beleue thoſe thynges that they
declare of Pompe, Pyrrhus,
Hannyball, &amp; the Conſull Marius,
of the Dictator Caeſar, of
Marke Antony &amp; many others

we ſhall finde they blamed not
fortune ſo muche to be vāquiſhed
by others, as in their proſperitie
they wer ruled by their
owne aduiſe and counſelles.
            It is true, that often tymes the
opinion of our kinne &amp; frendes
maketh vs to enter into buſynes
out of the waye of reaſon,
not caryng but for a foliſhe auauncement
of goodes and riches.
And at the ende when by
their ſettyng forth one hath enterpriſed
a certaine buſynes of
importaunce whiche doeth require
ayd and helpe, thoſe ſame
be the laſte that ſheweth theim
ſelues helping frendes: whiche
is ye occaſion many tymes that
men cānot returne frō enterpriſyng
ſuche thinges as neither
ſhall growe to their honor nor

profite. Many men ſay that
they haue enemies, recountyng
theim often without findyng
nūber: Although it be true if it
be well noted, that none haue
oftener or agreater enemy then
him ſelf. And the moſt greateſt
daunger that I ſee, is that vnder
the ſhadowe to preferre &amp;
make better my ſelfe, my ſelfe
is the cauſe of my deſtruccion.
The Philoſopher Neotidas on
a tyme beyng aſked which was
the beſte counſell that a manne
might take? He anſwered, the
counſell of others with the diſpraiſyng
of his owne: and he
ſheweth the cauſe, for that the
corrupcion of mā is ſuche, that
often he ſearcheth in him ſelf
with great pain, that whiche in
the head of another, he fyndeth

wt great eaſe: then it foloweth,
that in the beſt tyme of our life
our owne life deceiueth vs, the
euil cōmeth furth on euery ſide,
heuy thoughtes ouertaketh vs
our frendes leaueth vs, perſecutors
tormenteth vs, troubles
maketh an ende of vs, and ambicion
burieth vs. If we beholde
this thyng: what we be:
wherof we be: and wherfore we
be, we ſhall fynde that our beginnyng
is obliuion, our middle
age trauail, the ende ſorow,
and altogether an open errour.
Then ſe how heuy is the courtiers
life, as alſo how daungerous
the waye is, where as bee
ſtoones to ſtumble at, myer to
ſticke faſt in, yſe for to falle on,
pathe wayes for to loſe him in,
water for to paſſe thorow, thefes

for to be afrayde on, great
affaires and buſynes to do, ſo
that harde it is for any to goe
there as they would, and more
harder to ariue there as they
deſire. All theſe thynges haue
we ſayd, to the entent that the
Courtiers may vnderſtād that
neither I nor they can choſe ye
good waye and leaue the euill,
voide that that hurtes vs, and
conſerue that whiche profiteth
vs, folowe reaſon and plucke
awaye the occaſion: but if by
chaūſe ſome good fall to vs,
we thanke fortune, and if
euil come to vs, then
we do put the fault
in her.
         
         
            
            The .ii. Chapiter
            ¶How that none ought to counſel
another to go to the court nor when
he is there to come from it, but
euery man to choſe the life
that beſt he liketh.
            
               ARiſtarch the great Philoſopher
of Theban,
ſayd that tyme and mā
was ſo diuers, that hard it was
for the moſt wiſeſt to chuſe that
to them was good, and to kepe
them from that to them is euil.
            There is nothing more true,
for we ſee dayly, with the ſame
that one is healed, another falleth
ſicke: with that that one
waxeth better, another waxeth
worſe: with that that one is amended,
another is put doune:
and to conclude, with that litle
thing that one is cōtent withal
another is in diſpaire. The lerned
Alchymus was by his Moecoenas
               
kyng Demetrius, aſked
wherein ſpecially did conſiſt ye
greateſt trauail of the worlde?
He anſwered, there is few thinges
but in them there is either
trauail or ſuſpicion, but aboue
all the mooſte exceſſiue trauail
that a man may haue, is neuer
to be ſatiſfied: And that this
is true, we perceiue that when
a litle thing cōtenteth vs, how
lytle ſoeuer it be, we make it
our paradice with ye reſt of our
life: whiche ſeldome chaunſeth
to fewe mē, becauſe that liuyng
as we liue, not beyng cōtented,
would aſſaie &amp; knowe if it wer
good to be a kyng, a prince, a
knight, a maried man, a religious
or a marchaunt, a laborer,
a ſhepeherd, or of ſome other
eſtate. And at the ende, when al

is proued, it ſhall be harde to
fynde where we would reſt, ſo
vnconſtaunt is the lightnes of
menne. The wiſe determineth y•
to choſe the beſt is the meane.
A ſimple creature is lightly
contented with a ſmall thyng,
but he that hath a great harte,
thinkes that pouertie is a greuous
life, like as they that be
of high eſtate feare ye fall of fortune.
Plato was in his yong
yeres very worldely, as he that
had ſene muche, aſwell in the
warres as in offices, in whiche
he was vſed, and alſo in handy
craftes. On a tyme it was aſked
him wherin he had founde
moſt quietnes and reſt? He anſwered
there is no eſtate of life
wherin is not mutabilitie, ther
is no honor where is perill, no

riches where is no trauail, no
ꝓſperitie but it endeth, nor alſo
pleaſure but faileth: but when
all is ſayd, I neuer founde ſo
muche quietnes of mynde, as
ſince I left myne offices in Cities,
withdrawyng me to my
bokes: ſignifiyng, that as long
as we liue ſeruauntes of the
worlde, we deſire all,, we proue
all, we procure al, then al thinges
well ſene &amp; taſted, all thinges
do anoye vs: the greateſt
parte of our diſquietnes commeth
hereof, that the aboundaunce
we haue, ſemeth to vs
lytle, and the lytle of others, ſemeth
to vs muche. We ſaye
that our wealth is trauail, and
that the euil happe of others is
reſt: we condemne others actes
and we allowe our owne: we

watche to gette ſomewhat, and
ſodenly we ſlepe to leſe it again:
we immagyn that al men
liues content, &amp; we alone nedy:
And yet the worſt is, we beleue
that that we dreame, and put
not our truſt in that that we ſe
before our iyen. What waye
one ought to folowe or what eſtate
he ought to choſe, none
can well knowe nor counſell,
becauſe y• thyng is ſo troubleſome
and without good iudgement,
by whiche many is deceiued?
If the ſailyng on the ſea
be daungerous, ſo is the walking
on the yearth troubleous.
            As touchyng our life, we ſee
that he that is whole, daily falleth
ſicke, the ſicke dyeth, ſome
other ſcapeth deadly daūgers,
and ſome others lyngers forth

to death. As touching the walfaryng
men, aſſone commeth he
to his lodgyng that goeth foftly,
as he that goeth haſtely and
loſeth his way. He that is in
fauor, liuyng in ſlothfull reſte,
had as muche neede of vpholdyng,
as he that continually
ſweates in trauail. Therfore
I conclude, that there is nothing
in this worlde ſo certain,
as that all thynges is vncertaine.
            Then let vs returne to that
we ſpake of: It is ſayd that it
is fearefull, to counſell any to
marry, to ſtudy, to go to ye war,
or to take vpon him any other
thing, then that he is called to:
becauſe in this caſe none is ſo
apte to receiue, yt to him is ſayd
as he is to receiue that whiche

he is naturally inclyned to.
Plutarche greatly praiſeth in
his boke of the cōmon welth, ye
good Philoſopher Plato (and
not without cauſe) for he vſed
a great policy, which was that
there was no yong man entred
into his ſchoole, but firſt he
would proue him whether he
was enclined to lernyng or no,
ſo that thoſe that he thought
not apte to ſtudy, he ſent theim
backe, cauſyng thē to vſe their
liues in ye cōmon welth. Alcib ia
des the Greke mā be a ſufficient
wytneſſe vnto you, whiche although
he was yong brought
to the ſchoole, and taught of a
diſcrete maiſter, yet notwithſtā
               ding
his inclinaciō was ſuche,
that he profeſſed himſelf wholy
to the warres. To him that is

borne to weare a ſwerde by his
ſide, it ſemeth him yll to wear a
typpet about his necke, and he
that loueth to kepe ſlepe, the
court is nothyng fitte for him.
To her that deſireth mariage,
it is harde to kepe her chaſt: He
that loueth to be a barber, why
ſhould he be made a Paynter.
To coūſel our frend to learne a
crafte for to liue by, is but wel
done: but eſpecially to appoint
him what crafte he ought to
lerne, that me thynketh worthy
to be reproued: which brought
the lawes of the Lacedemonians,
the Lacedemonians commaundyng
to the fathers vpon
great paynes, to putte none of
their chyldren to no crafte, till
they were .xiiii. yeres of age to
ſee that in the age of diſcrecion

what their nature was enclined
to. Let vs leaue this long
communicaſion, and ſpeake of
that we ought to aduertiſe the
redar of: to coūſell any to leaue
the court, ſuche coūſel I thinke
not beſt to geue, nor yet wiſedome
for other to take, ſeyng
that there is doubte to counſell
any in that they ought to do:
Howbeit myne aduice is, that
the ſage perſons choſe to liue
in a quiet ſtate, and to dwell in
ſuche a place, that he may leade
a life without reproche, &amp; chriſtianly
to dye. Oftentymes
men do remoue from one coū
               trey
to another, from one toune
to another, from one ſtrete, frō
one houſe, from one companye
to another: but to conclude, if
that he had peine in the one, he

doeth cōplaine himſelf vtterly
of the wronges of the others:
And this is the reaſon, becauſe
he layeth ye faulte to the nature
of the countrey, which nothing
els is but his owne euil nature.
What more ſhal we ſay, but in
Courtes, in cyties, in villages,
and in other places, is ſeen the
vertuous and the diſcrete corrected,
and the vicious not blamed.
The wicked with their
wickednes ſercheth by all meanes
to make themſelues worſe.
And likwiſe doth to ye vertuous
with their vertues, make them
ſelfes better in what ſtate ſoeuer
he be called. As for the prelates,
there is no charge in the
Churche ſo daungerous but
that a good conſcience can auoyde
it, but a weake or corrupt
cōſcience may ſone be caſt

great lorde, he wyll ſay that he
hath nothing where wt to finde
him: If we aduiſe him to be a
religious, he wyll ſay that he
cannot riſe early, if to marry he
wil ſay it wil greue him to here
his litle children cry and wepe,
to goe to ſtudye it would trouble
his braine, If he were coū
               ſailed
to withdrawe him to his
houſe, he would ſaye he could
not liue without company.
            Then preſuppoſe that whiche
is ſaid, that none ought to coū
               ſell
any to choſe the life he will
take concernyng his honor &amp;
the wealth of his life, becauſe
afterwarde he wyll more complaine
him, of the counſell that
he hathtaken, then the euil that
he hath ſuffered.
         
         
            
            The .iii. Chapiter.
            ¶Howe that a Courtier ought to
leaue the Court for not beyng in fauor,
but beyng out of it, to the entent
of that beyng out of it
be more vertuous.
            
               
                  PVblius Minus ſayth
in his Annotaciōs
that we ought to
thinke many daies
on that whiche we entend to do
in one daie. The kyng Demetrius,
ſoonne of Antigonus was
aſked by one of his capitaines
named Patroclus, wherefore he
gaue not battail to his enemye
Ptolome, ſeyng his ſtrength,
his witt and his nōber of men?
He anſwered, that a deede ones
done, is harde to call backe again,
and before a man begyn
a harde enterpriſe, he had neede
of long counſell. Agiſelaus a

wiſe capitaine of the Lycaoniens
beyng forced to anſwere ye
Ambaſſadors of the Thebeans
ſayd: Know not you O Thebeans
that to determyne a thyng
of importaūce, nothyng is meter
then long ſtudye.
            Plutarch doth greatly praiſe
the life of Sertoreius in that
he was not raſhe in determinyng,
but graue in enterpriſyng.
Suetone ſayeth that
Themperour Auguſt was neuer
haſtye to gette frendes, but
very diligent to kepe thē when
he had them. Of theſe enſamples,
note what daūgier he falleth
in, that is haſly in buſſineſſes
and quicke in counſels.
            None wyl wear a garment if it
be not ſowed: nor eate the fruit,
if it be not rype: nor drynke the

wyne, if it be not clere: nor eate
the fleſh if it be not dreſſed: nor
warme him with wode, if it be
not drye: Wherfore then do we
counſell vs with grene coūſel,
whiche ſoner ſhall ſmudder vs
then warme vs. The wiſe man
ought to haue before his iyen
a ſober deliberaciō in his affaires,
for if he thynke one houre
of that whiche he would ſay, he
had nede thinke .x. of that that
he would dooe: wordes be but
wordes, they may be corrected,
but neuer the vncōſidered dede
The fault of this, is that euery
man ſtudyeth to ſpeake, to diſpute,
to iudge, but none to liue
wel, nor yet to dye vertuouſly.
The graue perſons that wyll
conſerue their auctoritie may
not be teſtie or ſtubburne in

ſuch thinges as they enterprice
nor wilfull in that they take in
hand, nor fickil in that thei begyn:
for one of the greateſt fautes
that a man may haue, is not
to be founde true of his worde,
and inconſtant in that he hath
begun. A noble harte ought to
foreſee that he is charged with
and if it be iuſt and reaſonable
ſoner to dye, then not to do it:
by the whiche noble hartes are
knowen. It it were a thyng
harde &amp; almooſte impoſſible Achilles
to ſlee Hector: Agiſelaus
to ouercome Brantes: to Alexā
               der,
Darrius: to Caeſar Pōpeius:
to Auguſtus, Marcus Antonius:
to Silla, Mythridates: to
Scipion Hanniball: and to the
good Troian Dacebalus, theſe
noble princes had neuer been

ſo muche eſtemed as they bee,
but that they vttered their noble
courage. Then, good aduice
ioyned with a noble harte,
ought to gouerne great enterpriſes.
Then to our purpoſe,
my maiſter the courtier ſayth,
he wyll leaue the curſed life of
the court, and go dye at home,
ſaiyng, yt to liue in ſuche trouble
is a continuall death. O
how many &amp; often tymes haue
I hard theſe faire wordes, that
neuer were folowed, excuſyng
them onely by the deſteny of the
court, in the whiche they were
faſt glued. When that a courtier
lackes money, that any mā
doeth him diſpleaſure, or that
he hath loſt his proces: God
knoweth howe many othes he
maketh that he will forſake al,

not to leaue his euil cōdicions,
but becauſe that his buſynes
goeth backeward: but long his
purpoſe laſteth nor, for if our
courtier happe to cum to welth
or that he be inhaunced by his
prince, ye ſhall ſee his former
promiſes to waxe colde, his wil
and his deſire to remaine there
in ſuche wiſe ye ye would iudge
him to be naturally borne ther.
Fauor and couetuouſnes guideth
the Courtier, ſo that one
groweth with the other, and at
the ende conuerted frō the maner
of Chriſtians to courtiers.
For all men knoweth that the
court is a place wher men may
get welth, and likewyſe ye place
of mens vndoyng: We haue
already reherſed the occaſions
why men do withdrawe theim

from the court, ſome for lack of
mony, ſome for pouertie, or not
beyng in fauor, or for age, all
theſe thynges be of neceſſitie &amp;
nothyng of free wyll, nor yet
praiſe to them that ſo withdraweth
theim for the cauſes afore
ſayd: but the true leuyng of the
Courte, and of the worlde is,
when ye courtier is yong, ſtrōg,
in fauor, riche, &amp; in helth, then
with good harte to leaue the
courte, to fynde in other places
honeſt reſt after his degre: this
is ſayd, to the entente that he
whiche leaueth the court, ſhuld
leaue it merily and without repenting,
for feare that after his
ſorowe is paſt, he would be aſhamed
to returne to theſame,
where he may chaunſe to haue
great buſines.
            
               
The proude and vnpacient
men do many thinges in a day
whiche he had nede to mourne
for all the daies of their life.
            A colloricke heade is nothyng
mete for the court, for if he will
be reuenged of the ſhames, iniuries,
craſtes, &amp; wronges, that
in the court he ſhall fynde, let
him truſt that he ſhall ſuffre
more in one houre, then he ſhal
be able to reuenge in ten yere:
whoſoeuer leaueth the court let
him leaue it for euermore: becauſe
that if he wyll returne to
it again, &amp; leaue his dwellyng
in the countrey, he may be likened
to him, yt hath a continual
Ague: he that ſinnes &amp; mendes,
and after returnes againe to
ſynne, that ſynne is more greuous
then ye firſt. In lykewiſe

to leaue the court, and after returne
to it, is ſo open a faulte
that it cannot be hid, excepte ye
will ſay, he goeth to ſell vertue
and to bye riches.
            To our purpoſe, if we ſhuld
aſke of an auncient man, what
hath been the whole courſe of
his life, and that he would anſwere
vs, he hath enterpriſed
muche, wādered, ſpoken, ſearched,
founde and loſt. &amp;c. We
would ſaye that his life hath
been a diſſēblyng folly. What
ſhall we ſay then of our inconſtant
Courtiers that dayly do
theſame thynges? whiche forgettyng
themſelfes, for the obteinyng
of a litle fauour, do againſt
nature, flatter, &amp; begge.
Remember aboue all thynges
gentle reader here &amp; els where,

that I ſpeake not but of the vndiſcrete
Courtiers that can not
refraine their appetite with an
honeſt cōtentaciō: which thing
moſt chiefly cauſeth many ſage
&amp; diſcrete perſons to geue ouer
the Courte, becauſe to refraine
the wil of the heart, is a greater
paine then to content the body:
for the bodye is ſoone werye of
ſinnyng, but the heart is neuer
ſatiſfied in deſiryng: One may
knowe eaſily the compleccion
of the bodye, but the mynde of
the heart neuer, and to contentyng
leſſe, for the heart at euery
inſtaunt requireth nowe one
thyng now another, and within
a lytle tyme after forgetteth
all. O diſſemblyng heart that
vnder a pretēce to be clere and
loyall, make men to iudge that

hypocriſy is deuocion, ambiciō
nobilitie, auarice huſbandrye,
crueltie zele of iuſtice, muche
bablyng eloquence, foliſhenes
grauitie, &amp; diſſolucion diligēce:
To conclude, that euery man
ought to knowe how muche he
may do: If a mā know himſelf
to be ambicious, impacient, &amp;
couetous, let him go hardely to
the court: And contrary, if the
courtier fele his nature cōtent,
peaceable, and deſiryng reſt &amp;
quietnes, let him be dwellyng
in the village, and he ſhall
well knowe that he neuer
knewe how to liue, til
he had drawen him
ſelfe from the
Court.
         
         
            
            The .iiii. Chapiter.
            ¶Of the life that the Courtier
ought co leade, after that he
hath lefte the Court.
            
               
                  MYronydes a wyſe &amp;
ſage Philoſopher,
capitaine of the Boheciens
ſayd, that ye
prudence of a man was aswell
knowen by retiryng from the
euil, as in choſyng of the good,
foraſmuche as vnder the euil
commonly the good can not be
hid, but vnder the pretence of
good muche euil may be diſſembled:
euen muche lyke as the
Antheme yt begynnes Perſignū
crucis and endes in Sathanas &amp;
Barrabas: In like maner ye great
euils haue their beginnyng by
ſum pretēce of fained goodnes,
in ſuche ſort that they be counterfeict

muche lyke Maſkers,
wrapt in ſwetenes as purgyng
pylles, and gilte as is the Rubarbe.
Ther is no mā I thinke
ſo mad that kepeth not himſelf
in aſmuche as he can from catchyng
euil, &amp; ſpecially frō open
euil: but contrarywiſe, it were
wyſedome to kepe him frō that
whiche is not altogether good.
            Alexander the great, cauſing
himſelfe to be healed of certain
woundes that he had receiued
in battail, was reproued of his
great minion Parmeno for puttyng
himſelfe into great hazard
in the warre: To whom
Alexander ſayd, aſſure me my
frende Parmeno of thoſe that
be diſſemblyng frendes, for I
wil be ware of them that be my
open enemies.
            
               
               Alcibyades, Agiſelaus, Pyrrhus,
Antigonus, Lentulus, and Iulius
Caeſar, were ſo circumſpecte in
theſe thynges that they wer alwayes
vāquiſhers, and died in
the hādes of their frendes, and
ſpecially becauſe thei choſe the
good and lefte the euil.
            Then he that leaueth ye court
ought not only for to ſee what
he leaueth, but alſo what he taketh,
cōſideryng that asmuche
or more harde it is to contente
him hauyng left the court, as it
was afore in the deſiryng to be
in the court: what profiteth it
to leaue the court wery &amp; troubled,
If thy harte can fynde no
reſt in the place whether thou
reſorteſt? Our bodye fulfilled
with meates is led where one
will haue it, but the heart is neuer

ſatiſfied with deſiryng, and
would (if he might) be in fauor
with princes of the courte, and
on the other ſide at his eaſe in ye
village. If the Courtier dayly
haue mynde beyng at home of
the paſſions &amp; affliccions that
he had in the Court, it had been
better for him neuer to haue
gone frō it, becauſe that in remembryng
them, the thinkyng
is more prickyng, &amp; the mynde
weaker to reſiſt them.
            In the court of princes chaū
               ſes
often tymes that lacke of
money or other great buſynes
makes a manne abſtayne from
doyng euil, the whiche beyng
after in his houſe doeth ſuche
dedes vnſemely to a gentlemā,
that they deſerue to be corrected,
yea, and bitterly puniſhed.
            
               
There be alſo another ſorte
of men that forſakes the court
to be more idle at home: And
ſuche would be reiected frō the
nomber of honeſt menne, ſeyng
they choſe ye tyme for their purpoſe
to ſinne in the village, fearing
to be infamed or diſhonored
in the court, and yet beyng
in the countrey liues wt ſhame
forgettyng all reaſon. To exchue
theſe thynges he that leaueth
the Court ought to leaue
his percialitie that he hath folowed,
&amp; to forget all paſſions:
otherwiſe he ſhal lamēt ye ſwete
bitternes that he leues, &amp; wepe
the life that he hath begunne.
            This is true, that in the court
are more occaſions geuen to
deſtroy a mā, then are at home
in his owne houſe to ſaue him.

It is a ſmall profite to ye courtier
the chaūgyng of his dwellyng,
onles by theſame meanes
he chaunge his condicions.
            When the courtier ſayth I wil
withdrawe me to my countrey
and go dye at home, that is wel
ſayd: but this ſhall ſuffice that
he honeſtly withdrawe him
ſelfe, without determyng there
dye. This mortall life is to
vs ſo preſcript, that we ought
not to purſue it with ſorowe,
but that we are bounde to amende
it. When Iob ſayd Tedet
animam meam vite mee, it
was not for that his life weried
him, but becauſe he did not
amende it.
            Whoſoeuer leaueth ye court
may be bolde to ſay yt he goeth
not to dye: but may wel thinke

he hath eſcaped from a fayre
priſon from a confuſed life, frō
a daungerous ſickenes, from
a ſuſpicious conuerſacion, frō
a great ſepulchre, &amp; frō a meruail
without ende. The wyſeſt
beyng in ye court may ſay euery
day that they dye, &amp; at their
houſes in the coūtrey that they
liue. And the reaſon is: that beyng
in the court, thoſe neceſſary
thynges that are to be done in
the worlde, cannot be done as
they wold, nor when thei wold,
for lacke of libertie. Yet I will
not ſay, but many in the court
do their deuor to do as they
would, but I dare affirme yt for
x. pounde weight they haue of
honeſt will, they haue not halfe
an ounce of honeſt libertie.
            Likewiſe, let him that forſakes

the Court ſette a wiſe ordre in
ſuche buſynes that he hath to
do, callyng to minde that to go
home to his countrey nedes no
lōg iorney, but to diſpoyle him
ſelfe of the euil clothes of the
Court nedes a wonder long
tyme. For like as vices increaſe
in a man lytle and lytle, ſo is it
mete to roote theim out by litle
and litle. This ought ye courtier
to do that myndes to rule
himſelfe, plucke vppe by lytle
pieces the moſt notable faultes
that are in him, and ſo pretely
diſpatche himſelfe of one vice
to day, &amp; frō another to morow,
in ſuch ſort that when one vice
takes his leaue and is gone,
ſtraight way a vertue do entre
in his ſteade, ſo yt in proces he
may go frō good to better. The

courtier is in nothing more deceiued
then in liuyng a wilde &amp;
wanton life, parauenture the
ſpace of .xx. or .xxx. yeres, thinketh
in a yere or two to become
ſage &amp; graue, aſwell as though
he applied all his life in a ſobre
and ſad life, &amp; truely that happeneth
for lacke of good iudgement,
for it behoueth without
compariſon a lenger tyme for
to lerne to caſt away vice, then
to learne vertue: conſideryng yt
vices enter our gates laughyng
and goeth out from our houſe
wepyng &amp; lamentyng. O how
muche greueth it ye ambicious
courtier, when he can not commaunde
as he was wont to do?
then it may be ſayd, yt to forſake
the court is requiſite to a good
heart, &amp; a good witte to obtain
reſt.
            
               
Thoſe that leaue the Court
for fainte heart, be of that nature
that it is more painfull to
theim to ſee theimſelues abſent
from the Court, then their ioye
was when they wer in ye court:
whiche ſayd perſons if they
would folow myne aduice and
counſel ſhould not onely leaue
the court, but forget it vtterly
for euer. And farther, the courtier
ought to retyre in ſuche
maner that he may come to the
Court againe, if the feare and
ſtudy in orderyng of his houſholde
conſtraine him eftſones
for to deſire the voluptuouſnes
of the court. In the heart of
the prudent courtier that forſaketh
the court, when there falleth
biſhoprickes or other great
offices, the affeccions &amp; deſires

of the mynde ryngeth alarme,
when he ſhall thynke if I had
not come awaye ſo ſoone, that
office or that dignitie had been
myne: but he again remēbryng
that many ſuche thinges hath
fallen which he had not: ſo like
wiſe might he haue in the ſtede
of ye, a plain nay, of that which
fell when he was gone. Then,
is it not muche better to ouerſe
and trauaile his owne houſe
then to haue ſuche a ſhamefull
denial in the court?
            Therfore deſtinies of ye courtiers
are ſo prompte and ready
that for the moſte parte one is
conſtrained to diſpiſe thē more
by neceſſitie, then by wyll, and
in that meane while their purpoſe
is at an ende before they
themſelues beware therof, For

when the Courtier commeth to
be at a quiet wt himſelfe, aboue
all thynges it is neceſſary that
he take hede of peſteryng of
himſelfe, for if he did liue in the
court euil willed, let him take
hede that in the village he diſpaire
not, by reaſon of charge,
the importunitie of his wife, of
his children, &amp; the ſautes of his
ſeruauntes, the grudgyng of
his neighbours may parcaſe
make him aſtonyed: but to
thinke again, that beyng eſcaped
from the daūgerous golfe
of the court, he may repute him
ſelfe halfe a God. And beſides
this, none ought to thinke that
he dwellyng in a village in the
countrey ſhall putte awaye all
troubles and diſpleaſures, for
it can not be, but he that neuer

fell in the croked &amp; rough way
may happen to ſtumble in the
plaine way &amp; breake his necke:
and therfore it is neceſſary that
he retiryng frō the court, take
the tyme as it ſhall come, that
he may the more occupie him
ſelfe in vertuous exerciſes, to ye
entent that to much reſt, and to
much buſynes of minde let him
not from the great good that
commeth of this, to be well cō
               tented
with a litle. Ioyne vnto
this alſo that there is none ſo
muche enemye vnto vertue as
is idlenes, of the which idlenes
be taken in the beginnyng
thoughtes ſuperfluous, &amp; cōſequently
the diſtruccion of men.
            To the purpoſe, hath not the
courtier cauſe to cōplaine, that
occupieth himſelfe in nothyng

but in eatyng, drinkyng, &amp; ſleapyng,
and in the meane ſeaſon
his better age, that is to ſay, his
youth conſumeth away, as the
fume of ſmoke, which procedes
of idlenes in the court &amp; doyng
nothyng? where contrarywyſe
he might in the village exerciſe
himſelf to his honor, and to the
helth of his body and profite of
his neighbour.
            In like maner alſo, the courtier
that withdraweth himſelfe
ſhuld vſe the company of ſuche
as be graue, ſage and honeſt, to
the entent that in the ſtede of
lyers, flatterers, &amp; triflers whiche
he was aſſociate withall in
in the court, he may be accompanied
in the village with wiſe
and ſage frendes, or at the hardeſt
with good bokes, whereby

in the lokyng of theim he may
vertuouſly imploye the reſidue
of his tyme, and with ſobrietie
entertaine euery man, that men
may ſaye he is come from the
court to pleaſe the good, and
not to rule. And if parcaſe one
would make him baylief in the
village or other publique office
I would counſail him to take
hede therof as he would of the
peſtilence, for becauſe there is
nothyng ſo troubleous nor ſo
harde a burden to the mynde
as to take charge of the rude &amp;
ſymple. I do not ſaye naye, but
that he may and ought to help
the poore commons of the village
with ſuche knowlege as
he hath lerned in ye court, or had
before he came ther, when they
ſhall haue nede, either for loue

or for money. Alſo if they be at
variaunce, healpe to appeace
thē: if they be euil intreated, defende
them. And this doyng, he
ſhalbe eſtemed of the cōmons &amp;
praiſed of ye wiſe and prudent.
Aboue all thynges beware of
prodigal apparel, ſuperfluous
bāquetes, and delicate meates,
and ſtrong or precious wynes.
For the abſenting frō the court
ought to be to none other purpoſe
but to liue ſoberly in the
village, or els ſhall he make of
the village the court, whiche
ſhould make of the court, the
village. And the courtier retyred
frō the court ought to haue
in ſinguler cōmēdacion mercy,
as to viſite hoſpytalles, ſuccor
the poore, counſel the orphans,
vyſite the pryſoners, reade the

holy ſcripture, and finally that
he ſtudy to diſpoſe his goodes
vertuouſly duryng his life, for
when he ſhalbe dead, euery mā
wyll clayme his goodes, but
none will or can diſcharge his
ſolle. And moſte chiefly, let the
courtier that goeth from the
court occupie himſelfe vertuouſly
to dye. All theſe thynges
that I haue ſayd, let no mā ſay
that they be more eaſy to reade
then to do: for if we wil enforce
our ſelfes, we are more then
our ſelues, &amp; do not then
well remembre our
ſelfes.
         
         
            
            The .v. Chapiter.
            ¶That the ruſtical life is more
quiet and reſtful and more beneficiall
then that of the
court.
            
               
                  THE village whereof
we ſpeake and the demaines
therof, Put
we ye caſe that it were
all free and not ſubiect to any
lorde (as certain there be ſo preuileged)
that euery man there
lyeth in his owne houſe, whether
it be by ſucceſſion, or that
he haue bought it freely without
doyng any homage or ſeruice
to any man. This I dare
ſay, the courtier hath not, nor is
not in ſuche free libertie in reſpecte
of ſuche as be of the village,
foraſmuche as of very neceſſitie,
my maiſter the courtier

muſt wyn ye Marſhal or Harbēgar
of the lodging, and muſt
receiue at his handes the billet
to come to his lodgyng, &amp; that
late ynough &amp; wery to his hoſt,
breake opē dores, beate doune
walles, diſorder houſes, burne
implementes and ſometime bet
the good man, &amp; defile the wife.
O how happye is he that hath
wherewithall to liue in the village
without troublyng bothe
of himſelf &amp; many ſondry places,
without ſeking of ſo many
lodgynges, without aſſayes of
ſo many ſtraunge occaſions of
ſtraunge men, without weping
of any perſon, but is content
with a meane eſtate, and is deliuered
of al ſuche breake braines.
Another benefite of the
countrey is this, that the gētleman

or burges that there doth
inhabite maye be one of ye chief
or chefeſt, either in bountie, honor,
or auctoritie, the whiche
happeneth ſeldome in the court
and in great cities and tounes:
for there he ſhal ſe other go before
him, more trym and more
braue and gorgious then he, as
well in credite as in riches, as
wel in the houſe as without the
houſe. And Iulius Caeſar ſayd to
this purpoſe that he had rather
be the firſt in a village, then the
ſecond in honor in Rome. For
ſuche men as haue high hartes
and mindes, and baſe fortune,
it ſhould be to thē muche better
to liue in ye village with honor,
then in the court ouerthrowen
and abated, and out of fauor.
The difference betwene the tariyng

or abiding in a litle place
and a great place, is that in the
litle places are founde muche
people poore and nedy, of whō
men may take compaſſion: and
in the great place many riche
men wherby enuy is noriſhed.
            Another commoditie in the
village is, that euery man enioyeth
in quiet and peace ſuche
as God hath geuen him, without
to haue ſuche to come to
their houſes, that ſhal cōſtraine
theim to make extraordinary
expenſes, or to haue his wife ſeduced,
or his doughters defiled
The occaſiōs to do euil be put
away by reaſon that he is occupied
in the mainteinyng of his
houſholde, in trainyng of his
doughters, in teachyng of his
ſonnes and chaſtenyng of his

ſeruauntes. He liueth confirmed
to reaſon and not to his opimō:
and liues hopyng to dye
&amp; not as he that loueth to liue
euer. In the village, thou ſhalt
not care for good lodgyng, nor
for lookyng to thy Horſes and
Mules, nor for the ladyng of
ſuche thinges as they ſhall cary.
Thou ſhalt not here the
criyng of pages, the plaintes
of the ſtuardes of the houſe,
the babling of the Cookes, nor
thou ſhalt not feare neither
Iudges nor Iuſtices leſt they
ſhould be to ſore againſt the.
And that whiche is muche better,
thou ſhalt haue no craftie
knaues to beguile the, nor
women to betray the.
            Another benefite of the village
is this, that he ſhall haue

tyme enought to al thinges that
he will do, ſo that the tyme be
well ſpent, tyme enough to ſtudy,
tyme to viſite his frendes,
tyme to go a huntyng, and layſer
when he liſt to eat his meat:
the whiche layſer courtiers cō
               monly
hath not, foraſmuche as
they employe the moſte part of
their tyme in making of ſhiftes
to play ye courtier, or to ſpeake
more plainely, to wepe and lament,
in ſuche ſorte yt one may
ſay of thē that whiche the Emperour
Auguſtus ſayd of a Roman
a great buſie broker the
ſame day that he dyed. I wonder
ſayd he, ſeyng the tyme failed
him to chop and to chaūge,
how he could now fynde layſer
to dye? Another commoditie of
the village is this, thoſe that

be dwellers there may go alone
from place to place without to
be noted to fall from grauitie,
they nede no Mule nor Horſe
with afoote clothe, nor page to
wayte of my lorde, or damoſell
to waite vpon my lady. And
that were ſcorneful to do in the
court alone: And without daū
               ger
one may walke frō neighbor
to neighbor, and from land
to land, and not therby miniſh
any part of his honor.
            Another benefite is, that men
may go whether they will, clothed
ſimply with a ſtaffe in his
hande, a ſwearde by his ſide, or
hacbut in his necke, and if he
be wery of pounſed hoſen, lette
him wear ſloppes, if he be a
colde lette him take his furred
goune for all is one there. A

good Gentleman dwellyng in
the village and hauyng a good
cote of clothe, an honeſt Spaniſhe
cloke on his backe, a
paire of lether ſhooes, goeth as
wel trymmed to the churche as
doeth my lorde the courtier to
the court with his goune furde
with Marters or Sables. A
man of the village of what ſort
ſoeuer he be, is in as good caſe,
that rydeth to market or to the
faier to make prouiſion for his
houſholde vpon a mare or a
nagge, as a lorde of the courte
is at Iuſtes vpō a great courſer
trapped with golde. And
(when all is ſayd) better is the
poore ploughman on a poore
aſſe, liuyng as he ſhould, then
the riche man well horſed, pillyng
&amp; doyng extorcion to pore
honeſt men.
         
         
            
            The .vi. Chapiter.
            ¶That in the village the dayes
ſeme more long and the ayer more
clere and better, And the houſes
more eaſy and teſtfull.
            
               ENſuyng ſtyll the cō
               modities
of the village,
we ought not to
forget that he whiche
dwelles there, among other
thynges hath commoditie of
good corne, and conſequently
good breade: contrary to this,
in the court, &amp; ſpecially ingreat
tounes they haue bread for the
moſte parte euil baked or euil
leuened or not leuened at all, &amp;
the cauſe is, foraſmuche as in
the tounes often there lacketh
good corne, or good corne milles
to grinde the corue, and holſome
water, wherby often hath

come amōg them great death.
            Another commoditie in the
village is this, the whiche I
praiſe mnche, he that dwelles
there, may practiſe and labour
in mod thynges and better imploy
the tyme then in the court
or in ye great tounes: in whiche
places it behoueth a mā to diſſemble,
to ſay litle, ful of reuengyng
and enuyous, a treder of
ſtones and pauemētes, &amp; muſt
vſe grauitie, &amp; ſeldome to come
out of his houſe, and inceſſantly
be graue. O half a God, that
dwelles in the village, where
liberally one may ſpeake what
he will and ieſt with his neighbours
before his gates and his
wyndowe. And this may he do
without euer to chaunge or to
leſe any of his mean auctoritie
            
               
Another cōmoditie is in the
village, that thoſe that dwell
ther, be wtout compariſon more
helthfull and leſſe ſicke then in
the cities and in the courte, becauſe
in the great tounes the
houſes be more higher, and the
ſtretes narower, and more croked,
whiche is the cauſe that the
ayre is corrupt and makes mē
very euil at eaſe. In ye village
the houſes ſtand more at large
the men more better diſpoſed,
the ayre better, the ſunne more
clere, the yearth more ſwete, the
priuate goodes or cōmons better
ruled without contencion, &amp;
the exerciſe more pleaſant, and
the company much better: And
aboue all thinges the thoughtes
leſſer, and the paſtyme more
great.
            
               
Another commoditie in the
village is, that ther are no yōg
Phyſicians, nor olde ſicknes:
And contrary to this, the courtier
is conſtrained there to part
his goodes in fower partes, the
one part to flatterers, ye other to
men of lawe, another to pottecaries,
&amp; the fowerth to ye Phiſicians.
O well fortunate village,
foraſmuche as in the, ſeldome
or neuer is the Frenche
pockes named, neither the pauſy
not yet ye goute: fewe or none
there knoweth what is a Iulep,
a Pyll, a Sirup, or a Thyſan,
nor no ſodain ſickenes. What
will ye that I ſhall ſay more of
the village? And if it were not,
but that for neceſſitie, they are
compelled to builde there litle
pretie houſes, ye ſhould ſcant

fynde one of theim that knewe
what to do with morter &amp; ſtoones?
And ſometyme they are
very well pleaſed with cabons
made of ſmall ſtickes well faſtened
together.
            Another commoditie in the
village is, that thee daies there
ſeme to be more long, and they
are better imployed, then they
are either in the court or in the
great tounes, foraſmuch as the
yeres paſſe awaye there or one
be ware, and the daies without
any enoiyng of them. And how
beit that the ſportes and pleaſures
be more in the village
then in the tounes, yet ſo it is
that one day ſhall ſeine lenger
there then ſhal a moneth in the
court: &amp; the reaſon is, for that
the village is happye and fortunate,

foraſmuche as there the
Sunne ſemes to make a more
longer day, the mornyng is redy
to ſhew, and the night ſlow
to come. Scarcely one can perceiue
the dayes ſlyde away in
the court: In the village if it be
perceiued, it is beſtowed with
honeſt buſynes, whiche cannot
be done in the court.
            In the village alſo is muche
more plentie of wood then in
other places: hay, ſtrawe, Otes
much better chepe then in good
tounes. Alſo in the village a
man is at libertie to eate his
meate where he will, &amp; when he
will &amp; with whō he will: but in
the court they eat late, the meat
euil dreſſed and colde, and with
out ſauor, and that whiche is

worſt of al, for the moſt parte,
he muſt eate with his enemies,
where as the good felowes of
the village liueth at their pleaſures
and without ſuſpicion,
keping their thre good faſhiōs
that belongeth to good repaſt,
that is, firſt he erneth his meat
next that he eateth his meate
merely, &amp; thirdly he eateth with
good company.
            Another commoditie is that
the huſbandman of the village
hath how to occupy themſelfes
and howe to be mery, whiche
the courtier, nor the citezen
hath not, thathath enemies enough
to feare, and fewe frendes
to company withall. O recreacion
pleaſaunt of the village,
to fiſhe with nettes, and
with hokes, to catche birdes wt
               
lyme, to hunte with dogges, to
catche Conies with ferrettes, &amp;
hayes, to ſhote in the croſbowe
and the hacbut at ſtokdoues,
at Mallardes &amp; at partryges:
and ſe folkes labor in ye vynes,
raiſe diches, amende hedgees,
to ieſt with ye aūcient laborers,
All theſe pleaſures haue they
of the villages, whereas the
courtiers and citezens deſire
it &amp; cānot haue it.
         
         
            The .vii. Chapiter.
            ¶That commonly the inhabitauntes
of the villages be more
happy then courtiers.
            
               ANother commoditie of
the village is, that thei
do fele ye trauailes leſſe
on the workyng day, &amp; reioyce
merely on the holy day: where

the courtier continually vexed
with weightie and troubleous
affaires, neuer knoweth when it
is holy day. O village, it is not
ſo in the, wheras on the feaſtful
daye the clerke ceaſeth not to
tolle the bell, to make clene the
churche, to make redy ye alters,
the people honeſtly apparelled
the feaſtes commaunded to be
obſerued, the curate preacheth ye
goſpel, &amp; after diner they make
mery with a thouſande honeſt
paſtymes. In the great tounes
the holydaies are knowē when
the wyfes goe gaye, when they
ſlepe long in the mornyng, whē
thei play after diner: and generally
when they conſume the
day involupteouſnes and vanities.
            Another commoditie is this,

that where the courtiers vſe to
eate fleſhe and corrupt veniſon
&amp; wildefoule that is long kept,
they of the village haue their
meate freſhe and freſhe, tender
and holſome, &amp; as one may ſay,
in good ſeaſō: that is, houſdoues,
Partrige, pullettes, ſtockdoues,
wodcockes, Feſauntes,
fatte Capons, Conyes, Hares,
and innumerable victayl of al
ſortes. And ouer and beſydes
this, to their great aduauntage
they haue ſhepe that beareth
woll to clothe them, good mutton
to eate, dong to make fatte
their ground, and Kyddes and
Goates alſo, with Oxen to labor
in the plough, and kyne to
milke and make butter &amp; cheſe:
and hogges to make bacon of,
Coltes for to noriſhe &amp; horſes

for to ſerue them and for to ſell
when nede requireth. And another
priuelege of the village
is this, that the good ſhall be
honoured for a good man, and
the vnthriftie perſon knowen
as he is, whiche is not ſo in the
court, for ther is nomā praiſed
for that he deſerueth to be praiſed,
but becauſe he hath auctoritie
and riches.
            O how muche is the wiſe mā
honored in the village for his
wyſedome and good counſail?
how many tymes is he thākeo
and how many preſentes hath
he? If parcaſe one of his neighbors
haue any goodfruit in his
garden, a good melon, a good
pear, or a good muſcadel grape
gladly they wyll preſent him
therewith, as to him that

hath deſerued it.
            Another preuilege of the village
is this, that euery mā may
marry his daughters to his equalles
and neighbours, that
thereby dayly he may receiue
bothe pleaſure and ſeruice, the
whiche the courtiers cannot do
that marry their doughters ſo
farre frō theim, that for ye moſt
part they lament theim or they
ſee theim. O happy inhabitor
in ye village that fyndes at his
gate huſbandes for his doughters,
and wiues for his ſonnes.
He maryeth theim nigh to him
that he may eaſly ſee his ſōnes
in lawe, his litle nephues &amp; his
poſteritie: he is beloued of thē,
ſuccoured in his affaires, ſerued
&amp; noriſhed in his ſickenes,
and great cōforte to him in his
age.
            
               
Another commoditie is, that
they are not to muche carefull
nor yet ireful or enuious: whiche
commoditie they of ye court
and the citezens litle taſteth or
emoyeth: for the courtier many
times lacketh money, when his
great affaires ſhuld be brought
to paſſe. I ſay therfore o happy
mā of ye village, that nedes not
to go at ten of the clocke to the
palice to beg counſel, to ſpeake
fayre to ye vſſher, to waite vpō
the preſident &amp; make flectamus
ienua to the lawyer, and flatter
the kyng and his counſel, &amp; the
Magiſtrate: but hath in ſtede
of theſe Idolatries for a happy
ſolace, the benefites of nature
and ye paſtimes therof, to heare
the ſhepe blete, the Bulles to
bray, the Horſe to neſe, the Nityngales

to ſyng, ye Thruſhes
to warble, the Lynets to mynſe
their ſonges, dogges to runne,
Lambes to leape, Kyddes to
gambolde, &amp; ſee the Pekockes
ſet vp their tailes like a whele,
Hēnesto kecle, kockes to crow,
&amp; a thouſand kynde of beaſtes
and birdes play and ſporte.
            Another commoditie is, that
in the village one may be there
more vertuous &amp; leſſe vicious
then in the court or in the great
citiees, and ye reaſon is, for that
in great companyes we ſhall
cōmenly fynde a M. that kepe
men from good doyng &amp; x. M.
that will moue vs to do euill.
And in the village euery man
ſanctifyeth the Sabboth day,
kepeth the feaſtes, heareth the
ſermones, and by this meanes

with great labor worketh his
ſoule health aſſiſted by grace.
            Wherfore the village is to be
praiſed for that ye occaſions of
euil, and of our deſtruccion are
not ſo plentifull and practiſed
there, as they are in the court &amp;
in good tounes, no cokes houſes
to make them licorous: nor
there are no great eſtates wher
by enuy ſhuld ariſe: there is no
choppyng nor chaungyng by
vſury: whores to quarell and
fight for, nor courtiers to torney
in armure, nor wanton and
lewde places to corrupt youth
withall: nor Iuſtices to feare
them, ye (and that beſt of all is)
no couetuouſnes whiche ſhuld
ſwalow vp and deuoure them.
            Another preuilege there is,
that there one may well gather

ſome good, and ſpende muche
leſſe then in the court. For euery
man knowes well what exceſſiue
expēces are accuſtomed
to be waſted in the court, &amp; ſpecially
in theſe dayes, that the
great apparellyng of bākettes
is ſuche that they be well worthy
to be reformed. O peaceable
peyſaūtes which nedes not
the tapettes of Flaunders, linnyng
clothe of Holland, ſiluer
plate, garmentes imbrodered,
Parcement lace purfilde, nor
yet cariage, Mulettes, varlettes
to conduct them, nor other
ſuperfluous attyre: but contrary
in ſtede of that, is contented
wt a lytle houſhold well ruled,
with a groſſe table and a fewe
plaine ſtoles to eate his meate
vpon, with diſhes of Peuter &amp;

a mattres for to ſlepe on, two
gounes, one for ſōmer, another
for wynter, one geldyng in the
ſtable, one varlet, one chamberer
to do him ſeruice: As muche
happy is a gentleman and as
muche honored with his lytle
companye in his houſe in the
village, as is a riche lord in the
court with his great pride, and
ruflyng traine.
         
         
            The .viii. Chapiter
            ¶That in princes courtes the
cuſtome and vſe is to ſpeake
of God and liue after
the worlde.
            
               IN the Court, euen
as there is no rigorous
iuſtice, no father
that chaſtiſeth
his ſoonne, no frende that correcteth
one the other, none that

loueth his neighbor, no biſhop
nor curate that gouerneth well
his ſhepe nor teacheth them after
the goſpel: So he that is
by nature good, hath great libertie
to be naught. In the
court if one wilbe an adulterer,
he ſhall haue felowes. It he
wilbe a quareller, he ſhal haue
helpe, &amp; that with ſuche as will
drawe their ſwordes. If he be
diſpoſed to banquetyng, euery
where he ſhall fynde gluttons,
If he will manifeſtly &amp; ſhamefully
lye, he ſhall fynde companions
ready that will approue
his lies: If he wil ſteale, he ſhal
fynde theim that will inſtructe
him many wayes therto: If he
will play, there is ſo many cardes
and ſo many diſe, that it is
ſhame to ſee it: If one will be

falſely forſworne, he ſhal fynde
theim that will geue money for
forſwearyng: Fynally, if he wil
vtterly geue himſelf to do euil,
in the court he ſhall ſee perfecte
examples. To the court reſorteth
menne of diuers nacions,
ſome for buſines, ſome to plede
or to ſerue or to ſhewe theim
ſelues, whiche perſons to bring
themſelues acquainted are forced
to folowe the ſeruauntes of
ſuche as be in auctoritie, to flatter
them, &amp; ſpeake fayre to thē:
and to folowe the companies &amp;
felowſhip of the taberers, the
Pypers, the Muſycians, the
flatterers and mery ieſters, and
at ye ende become God knowes
poore and nedy gentlemen, in
ſuche wiſe that by very neceſſitie
thei be cōpelled to demaūde

rewardes, newyeres giftes and
new apparell. And yet to this
euil felowes, they whiche geue
vnto theim any good thyng,
geue it rather to get themſelfes
a name to be called ful of magnificence
then for any charitie
at all.
            In the Court, fortune is inconſtant,
in that ſhe promiſeth,
and yet more in that which ſhe
geueth, for at one inſtant, wher
one ryſeth, another falleth, one
is borne, another dyeth: he is
auaunced that is vnknowen, &amp;
the faythful ſeruaūt forgotten,
he that will abyde is not recciued,
but he that will runne away
is taken in: fooles are beleued
and wiſemen belyed, opinions
be folowed and reaſon
let paſſe. With theſe thinges

and other ſemblable thynges
that we aſſay and ſe in courtes
of princes, euery manne may
bee aſſured that fortune will
knocke at his doore, though for
the moſte parte the Courtiers
find ſoner their graue then any
good fortune, &amp; ſpecially ſuche
that vnder colour to be diſcended
of a good houſe, go to the
court to bragge, and yet neuertheleſſe
are ſo foliſhe and ignoraunt,
that it may be ſayd they
are more mete for the cart then
for the ſpere, ſo that they ſerue
in concluſion to be a daliance
to the mockers &amp; ieſters. And
one great miſchiefe is in the
court, that there is euer hatred
amonges the princes, enuye among
familiars, contencion among
officers and with their

felowes. And among theſe
there neuer lacketh medlers &amp;
buſye bodyes, whiche profite
more thereby, then ſome doctor
of diuinitie doeth by prechyng.
In the court all is ſuffered, all
is diſſembled withall, all is inconſtant,
and all ſortes deſyre
there to liue: and foraſmuche
as al ſuche deſire there to liue,
it is impoſſible but there muſt
be lyers, players, ſlaunderers,
and a great nomber of naughtie
perſons.
            In the court the euil foloweth
the euil: The brauler fyndes
one to braule withall: The
adulterer one that he may ſinne
withall: The thefe a companion
&amp; receiuer: The ſophiſter a
babler: &amp; all rekened together,
one ready to deceiue another.
            
               
In ye court euery mā praiſeth
&amp; commendeth himſelfe of holy
purpoſes and noble thoughtes.
One ſayeth he will withdrawe
himſelf from the court.
And another ſayeth he wil forget
his ſuites. Another ſayeth
he will quenche enemitie. And
when they haue all ſayd, all is
but wordes, for the heart thinketh
of nothyng els but of the
world. None knoweth there the
one the other: The men of armes
go without harnys: The
prelates without their rotchettes:
The prieſt without his porteaus:
The doughter without
her mother: The wife without
her huſband: The clerke without
his bokes: The thefe without
a ſpye: The glutton from

table to table. The vacabonde
frō place to place, and ye baude
from doore to doore, and from
harlot to harlot. In the court
there be biſhoppes to cōfirme
curates, to baptiſe &amp; chaunge
names: For he that is glorious
gay, thei name him honorable,
he that ſpendes all, full of magnificence,
the cowarde wiſe, the
valiaunt ouerhardye, the foole
ioyous, the wyſe an hypocrite,
the malicious ſubtle, the ſcoffer
eloquent, the adulterer Amorous,
the coueteous meſurable,
and he that talketh litle,
a foole and an ignoraunt
perſon.
         
         
            
            The .ix. Chapiter.
            ¶In the court fewe amende,
but many waxe worſe.
            
               IN the court it profites
litle, menne to
be wiſe, onleſſe they
be fortunate, foraſmuche
as good ſeruice is ſone
forgotten: frendes ſone faileth
and enemies augment, the nobilitie
doeth forget it ſelfe, ſcience
is forgotten, humilitie diſpiſed,
trueth cloked &amp; hid, and
good coūſell refuſed. The beſte
mine and the richeſt Alcumet
that the Courtier may haue, is
to haue wynde at will to ſayle
with, that is, to be in fauorwith
them that be fauoured, till fortune
laugh vpon him: for the
condicions and faſhions of entretainment

chaungeth dayly
and hourely. To proue this
true, Plato neades not to
ſpeake, nor Cicero to ſweare,
foraſmuche as afore our eyes
we ſee the foole become wyſe,
the meke, become proude, the
ſobre a glutton, the pacient a
brauler, and the deuout an euil
chriſtian man.
            In the court it is a great buſynes
and trauaile for to fynde
vertue, and greater daungier &amp;
peril to kepe it. Is not humilitie
loſt among theim that be in
honor, or paciēce among wrōg
doers, or abſtinence among
gluttons, or chaſtitie amonges
women, or reſt amonges buſynes,
or charitie amonges euil
willers, or peace amōges ſedicious,
or ſilence amongeſt bablers,

or good witte whereis ſo
muche folly? In the court no
man is content, euery man cō
               plaineth
either becauſe ye kyng
geueth him nought, or becauſe
the prince healpeth him not, or
that one or other is euer betwixt
him and home: He complaines
of the porter he wil not
let him in: of the treaſurer that
he payeth him not: of his crediture
whiche taketh away his
goodes: or of one or other that
that doeth him wrong in the
court. If one rede a letter of
pleaſure, he ſhal reade an hundreth
of diſpleaſure. The wife
ſhall write to her huſband and
praye him for to come home, yt
he may marry his doughters
beyng of age, or yt his children
be diſobedient, that his frendes
hath forſaken him, and that by

ingratitude thei render euil for
good, and werines doth aſſayle
her on al ſides, that her tenaū
               tes
cal her to the lawe, that his
goodes be ſpent? ſurely he ſhal
heare ſuche newes, ſo that for
two grotes that he geueth to
the bearer of ye letters, he wold
gladly haue geuē more to haue
hard no ſuche newes
            In the court a manne doeth
many thinges by neceſſitie, that
to dye for it he would not do in
his houſe: he dynes and ſuppes
with his enemies, he ſpeakes
with him that he neuer knewe
nor pleaſeth him not, defendes
him that helpes him not, foloweth
him that honoureth not
him, lendes to him that payeth
him not, diſſembles with him
that doeth him iniury, and truſtes
to him that beguiles him.

O vnhappy &amp; ſorowfull courtier
if by chaunce he growe to
be a poore man, no man will
ſuccour him, and if he fall ſicke
no man viſites him, and if he
dye he is incōtinent forgotten:
if he be vertuous no man commendes
him, and if he be out of
credite no man regardes him.
In the court there is nothyng
more rare nor more deare to recouer
then vertue, nor more eſy
to fynde then the aboundaūce
of thre maner of people. That
is of tale bringers, of flatterers
and of lyars. The lyers deceiueth
ye princes. The flatterers
the riche menne. The tale bringers,
thoſe that be in fauour.
The women, deceiueth the mē.
The coueteouſnes, ye olde men.
The pompe the prelates. The
auaricious, the prieſtes. The

libertie ye religious, ambicion,
the preſumptuous, ye wiſe cōfidēce
in men, &amp; al they ioyned together
be deceiued by fortune.
In the court men employe the
tyme ſo euil that from the tyme
the courtier doeth ariſe, tyl he
go to bed, he occupieth him ſelf
aboute nothing but in aſkyng
of newes, iettyng aboute the
ſtretes, write letters, ſpeake of
the warres, entertein them that
be in fauor, counſell with baudes,
make as he were in loue
and leſe alwayes the tyme. In
the court more then in any other
place the thinges are ſlow.
For one riſes late, and worſt of
all amendes his life late. All
thynges there is variable and
chaungeable and inconſtaunt.
The eſtates chaunge, The litle
aſſende, the great fall. The

widowes there be marde: The
maried be defamed: The maydens
be ſhamed: The good ſpirites
be dulled: The valiaunt
becommes cowardes: The prelates
waxe worſe &amp; worſe: The
ſciēces are forgotten: The yōg
leeſe their tyme: The olde vndone:
This is ye courtiers life.
He is not worthy to be a courtier
onleſſe he be in debte and
oweth to the draper for clothe,
to the Merſer for ſilke, to the
taylor for the makyng of his
apparell, to the goldſmyth for
iewels for my lorde ye courtiers
lady, to the Iudges for the diſputyng
of proceſſes, to the ſeruauntes
for wages, to their hoſtes
for their ſpence. There is
to muche euill counſail euen
ſuche as is more then the halfe
way ledyng to damnacion.
         
         
            
            The .x. Chapiter.
            ¶That a man cannot liue in the
court, without to trouble him
ſelfe or ſome other.
            
               A Courtier doeth many
thinges, more for
to ſay, I do as other
men do, then for any
neede he hath ſo to do. He bankettes
with euery man becauſe
he will not be called an hypocrite,
Playes becauſe he would
not be named a nigard, &amp; companyes
with many, becauſe he
wil not be named a ſolitarymā
and geues to raſcall &amp; naughtie
perſons becauſe he would
not be euil ſayd of them. A mā
in ye court is full of penſiuenes
and paſſions: For it is trueth
that it is appropried to theim
of nature that folowes ye court,

to be inceſſantly tormented. He
muſte praiſe his felowes, diſpraiſe
ſtraungers, &amp; loke vnto
therin that do well, and blame
them that do euil, and ſpend at
large with his felowes, and againſt
ye enemeys ſpare not his
owne proper life: And all this
muſt he do becauſe he will not
be diſpraiſed. In the court cō
               monly
one profeſſeth to wayte
of one maiſter, but for all that
he muſt ſerue at the taile of dyuers
others lordes. O broken
heart of the poore courtier that
muſt nedes ſerue ſuche as knoweth
him not, and make reuerence
to theim that deſerue not
to haue it, and muſt ſaye to my
maiſter the officer an hundreth
tymes a day, ſir and if it pleaſe
you. And he ſhall anſwere

when I am at leyſer? tary a
whyle at the doore. And yet we
muſt call him maiſter that deſerues
it no more then the hāg
man that ſtrangles a man with
a halter. O what pitie is it to ſe
a poore ſuiter in his nedy buſynes
folowe the kyng from
toune to toune euil noriſhed &amp;
worſe lodged? The kyng hath
buſynes, the counſeler is defe,
the Almoner hath no hande, &amp;
he that thou knoweſt hath no
eyes: And without money and
extreme pain, the fiue wittes of
nature be laine.
            In the court, albeit that one
hath no enemies whiche is ſeldome
ſeene, yet is it trueth that
many tymes his owne frendes
putte him out of quiet, foraſmuche
as if the courtier will

take reſt in his lodgyng, they
grunt at him becauſe he wyll
not go ſee his frendes and prouoke
him to go folowe ye princes
in the court, ſaiyng, that
the raſcall and the varlettes
mocke at him, that he goeth not
thether and ſhewe himſelfe free
and liberal: and when he is ariued
at the court, whiche is a
naturall enemye to reſt, and a
deſire of nouelles, then muſt he
chaunge, as doeth the Egipcian,
whiche euery day ſeketh a
newe countrey, a new lodging,
newe apparell and conuerſacions,
buſynes and faſhions
of menne. Lo my frende and
the reader of this: This is the
life of the courtier as it is here
diſcribed: and alſo of him that

liueth in the village the whiche
ſayd life of the peyſauntes ſhal
be muche praiſed of many, and
choſen of a fewe, becauſe that
euery man readeth bookes enough
&amp; the more he readeth ye
leſſe he chaungeth of his euil
cuſtomes. And to cal to reaſon
why it is ſo, it foloweth that the
court of prīces is good but for
two maner of menne, for theim
that be in fauor, &amp; for the yong
whiche be yet of a weake iudgement.
And thoſe that be in fauor,
&amp; doeth waite dayly, ſe thē
               ſelfes
ſo riche, ſo feared, and ſo
wel accompanied that thei fele
not the paine of the court. And
the pleaſure they gette thereby
makes them for cōcluſion forget
themſelues, yet notwithſtā
               dyng
for all this, it is impoſſible

but that their braines muſt
be troubled, becauſe they be to
much occupied, for their houſes
are to ful of people, their eares
full of lyes, their toungues to
much troubled wt anſwering of
euery mā, their heartes to much
preſſed to ayde and helpe them
that they would helpe, &amp; other.
And finally ye greater in auctoritie
&amp; credite they be, ye ſhal ſe
them ye more penſiue &amp; the more
aſtonyed, and for the moſt part
ſooner complaine then reioyce:
but cōmaunde who cōmaunde
will, haue credite who will, the
truth is, none can take pleaſure
of his goodes, wtout honeſt reſt
Beſide this thoſe which be ſayd
to be in fauor, are euer in feare
to be put doune frō their auctoritie:
And by that meanes are

in cōtinual drede and torment,
the whiche is an enemy mortal
to quiet and reſt. And the yong
in like caſe (as I haue ſayd) yt
be without iudgement &amp; blynded
in vices, do not knowe nor
ſee the incōmodities of ye court,
nor care, neither for fauor nor
honor, but boūden &amp; drounde
in volupteouſnes and vices,
paſſe the better parte of their
daies in the ſchoole that is nothing
worth, vnder the maiſter
of pardicion.
         
         
            The .xi. Chapiter.
            ¶That in the court thoſe that be
graue are praiſed and well eſtemed,
and the other that doeth the
contrary not regarded.
            
               THe courtier ſhuld not
aquaint himſelf with
vaine and ydle perſons,
that he be not reputed

to be ſuche as he companieth
withall. For it had not
been enough for him to ſaye he
muſt nedes do there asother do
and diſſemble as other diſſembles.
Neither behoueth it him
not to cloke his naughtie doyng,
in goyng ſecretely to ſuche
as be naught, for why? the
wittes of the courtiers are ſo
fine, that they knowe not onely
what one ſayeth but what he
thinketh. There is neither litle
nor great but menne ſpye him
whether he goeth, frō whence
he cōmeth, &amp; where he abideth,
with whom he talketh, in whō
he truſteth, and what he wil do,
ſo wel, that ye curtens may hide
a perſon, but to hide ye vices of
the courters is impoſſible. The
courtier alſo ought not to brag
and crake that thynges ſhalbe

as he would, he may not preſume
to ſpeake to the kyng and
require audience as he himſelf
luſt: for he yt foloweth the court
muſte be as one that hath no
mouth to ſpeake, nor hādes to
be auenged withal, beyng well
aſſured that there is no more
loue in the court, then are clothes
vpon a bare horſe. For he
that is in the court, and is not
armed wt pacience, it had been
muche better for him not to
haue come out of his countrey,
for beyng a quareller &amp; ſedicious
felow, in ye court he ſhalbe
hated, and paraduēture baniſhed
frō thēce, &amp; then his returning
ſhalbe to his vtter ſhame.
            Malice &amp; diſpleaſures take
often an end in the village, but
in ye court is alwayes an ouerplus

of theim. What is the
cauſe? Fortune I ſay of her,
whiche hath the rule ouer them
who counteth for a gooddeſſe,
whiche is more feared of a foliſhe
opinion, then for any power
ſhe hath ouer men.
            The courtier alſo ought not to
condiſcende to that whiche his
ſēſualitie requireth, but to that
whiche reaſon doeth perſuade
him vnto, foraſmuche as ye one
demaundes more then nedes, &amp;
the other contentes him wt leſſe
then he hath. Foraſmuche then
as in the court, ther is ſo many
tables to glutton on, ſo many
newe founde playes to play at,
ſo many quarelles to fight
for, ſo many matters to pleade,
there is no cauſe to meruaile if
the ſage be cheriſhed, and the

diſſolute perſon blamed. The
good mā within ye court, is as a
nutte within the ſhale, &amp; mary
within ye bone, &amp; a perle within
the cokle, and a roſe among the
thornes. I do not ſay reder, for
the qualitie and quātitie of the
malice of the court, that all be
vicious that be ther: God forbid
that it ſo ſhuld be, but whē
I call to remembraunce we be
all mortall men, I thynke it in
maner impoſſible to ariue ſafe
into the porte, among ſo many
Syllas and Caribdes. Ye will
ſay that the wily and the ſubtle
perſon there waxeth riche, and
that the great ſūmes of money
be there: I cōfeſſe it, &amp; I would
ſay your ſaiyng ſhuld be good
if they yt were of the beſt knowlege
&amp; the moſt verteous nomber

wer auaunced for their prudence,
as the other be by hazard
and chaunce or by theft, for the
reward of vertue, is not like to
the rewarde of fortune.
            Item the courtier ought not to
geue preſētes, nor lightly take,
for why? for to geue him that
deſerues it not, there lackes
wyſedome. And to receiue of
him that one ought not, is a
thyng but vile.
            Who that will exerciſe liberalitie,
ought to conſidre what he
geueth, and to whō he geueth:
for it ſhuld be but folly to geue
that whiche one may not, &amp; that
whiche he himſelfe nedes. And
one ought to conſidre the tyme
and the end and the ſeaſon, and
wherfore he geueth. And if the

courtier geue ſomethyng ouer
liberalitie &amp; without iuſt cauſe
of recompenſe of him whiche is
out of credite and in the tyme
that he beginneth to declyne.
            Is not then the gifte euil imployed?
is it not to be lamēted
that one geues ſoner to ye flatterer
to tel ſome feined or liyng
tales, or to a ieſter to make thē
laugh, or to a common lyer to
make them talke, or to a pleaſaunt
felow to inuent a lye, rather
then to a truſtie ſeruaunt
that hath all ye daies of his life
deſerued to haue thāke for his
good ſeruice? Yet for all this,
myne entencion is not to perſuade
great mē that they ſhuld
not geue to all men: but I ſay
the true ſeruaūtes ought to be
preferred, becauſe it is more

meter that their ſeruice ſhould
be rewarded, then the preſentes
of ſtraungers conſidered.
            When a mā geueth to ſtraungers,
the ſeruauntes ſeyng the
ſame drawe backe: ye may be
aſſured that they not only murmure
at that whiche is geuen,
but alſo accuſe him of his vngentle
dede, and become a mortal
enemy to him that the thing
is geuen vnto. The giftes makes
a man muche ſubiecte that
receiueth thē, for aſſone as any
man doeth take of another an
horſe or a goune, or often ſitte
with him at his table, he bindes
himſelfe therby to beare him fauour,
to defende his quarel, to
kepe him company, to take his
parte, and to loue that that he
loueth. And reaſon wil, that ſithens

one feleth profite of another
that he be not vnkynde,
howbeit let a manne beware to
bind himſelf ſo muche vnder ye
wil of other men, that he therby
forgetteth his owne honeſtie.
Many yong childrē diſcended
of an honeſt houſe go to ye court
&amp; take with them a good parte
of their goodes and conſume
theſame plaiyng, eatyng, and
drinkyng, and vſyng baudry &amp;
adultery vnder colour of learnyng
their behauior: and reſorte
to the great mennes houſes,
to no other intent, but to be
much made of of thē wher they
take a great repaſt, and afterward
ſo play the yong wanton
fooles, that they ſpende rent,
honor and all. And when the
purſe is flat, their office is to go

all the day in the ſtretes to the
churches and to the palaice to
aſke newes &amp; tidynges, only
to pype out lyes and fables
at the lordes boordes, &amp; all for
to go ſcot fre. And ther is a ſort
of yong men in the court, yea I
may ſay to you, of thoſe yt haue
beardes, that neither haue maſter
nor entertainers, that as
ſoone as a ſtraunger commeth
to the court, ſtraight waies thei
boorde him, ſaiyng that they
wyll ſhewe him the faſhions &amp;
maners of the court, the pleaſures
of the palaices, the maner
how to kepe him from deceiptfull
felowes, and to entertaine
yong gentlewomen. And
thus ye newecome courtier that
is yet a foole, in the meane ſeaſon
ſhalbe hādled in ſuche wiſe

that now goeth a goune, now a
coate, another tyme a horſe, &amp;
ſometyme purſe and all. And
there is another ſorte of men in
the court that buſieth thēſelfes
with ſo great auctoritie &amp; with
ſo litle wit, that after they haue
vſed ye company of ſome great
lorde, thei wil ſend him a lettre
by their page, ſaiyng they be
poore gentlemen, kynſfolke to
ſome great men, and that they
be there ſuyng for ſome office,
and that they haue a payment
in hand, wherfore they require
him to lende him a certain ſum
of money: And yet are they in
no ſuche neceſſitie, but onely to
get ſomewhat, either to buye a
gay coate, or a horſe, or to kepe
a whore.
            There is another ſort of falſe

&amp; beggerly courtiers, the which
after they be ones vſed to the
court, they go from churche to
churche to aſke for Gods ſake,
ſaiyng they be poore ſuiters
&amp; that thei loue better to begge
then to robbe, commending thē
               ſelfe
to the prieſtes to begge for
them on the poore pariſheners
when they preache, &amp; ſo take againſt
reaſon the good yt poore
men ſhould haue.
            There is another ſorte of
haunters in the court, that goe
from one houſe to another of ye
great eſtates and lordes, counterfaityng
to be diligent ſeruauntes,
ſlatteryng ye ſteward,
the butler, and the cooke, &amp; liue
of that whiche is lefte of the diners,
and goe their waies with
their pockettes and their ſleues

full of meate for ſo ſuppe with
all. And ther is another maner
of ſorte that go two and two &amp;
thre and thre together in a mornyng
to ſpye and ſee if there be
any thyng euil kepte, and with
that to looke and to prye if a
ſworde or a Spaniſhe cloke,
or a purſe be fallen aſide, if ther
be, thei ſyng in a mery note this
is pro nobis. Other there be y•
for to cōduict &amp; defend a whore
when ye court remoues (as one
may ſay more then ruffians)
they liue of the gaine of yt miſerable
womā. Another hath falſdiſe,
falſe marked cardes for to
deceiue the innocentes, wynne
their money, &amp; lccſe their owne
ſoules. And ther lackes not in ye
court olde women &amp; wrinckled
trottes yt after their harueſt is

paſt, cloke the ſynnes of other,
and beguile thoſe that be chaſt
and vndermine ſuch as be maried,
hurt their neigbours, ſell
maydens to whoredome for lucre,
and do noriſhe them therefore,
wherof folowes that theſe
olde whores ſometyme ſell wē
               ches
better chepe then fiſhers
do lamperyes. O beholde the
company of the court, the holynes,
the religiō, the brotherhed,
and finally the foule diſorder
of theſame. And I ſay for my
parte, go to the conrt who will
and there abyde, and triumphe
who will: as for my ſelfe I do
remembre I am a chriſten mā,
and that I muſt accompt for ye
tyme I haue loſt, &amp; therfore I
had muche rather to labor and
dygge &amp; delue out of the court

and be ſaued, then to be nighe
the kyng, my conſcience not
cleane nor pure.
         
         
            The .xii. Chapiter.
            ¶That in the court of princes
all ſay we will do it, but
none do it.
            
               
                  BY as the great Philoſoper
of great
renoume amōges
the Grecians, ſaid
vpō a tyme to the
great Alexander Quiliber in
ſuo negotio, hebetior eſt quam in
alieno, meanyng, that cōmonly
euery man is more blinded in
his owne affayres then in another
mannes. And he ſo ſayd
by very good reaſon, for yt ther
be menne, whiche for to geue a
wiſe deliberate and ſage counſel
for to remedy a ſodain miſchiefe,

haue excellēt wittes, ſo yt
it be in another mannes matter.
But in their own affaires
they haue neither witte to gouerne
their owne houſes, nor
ſtable mind to couer their own
miſerye. Cayus Iulius Caeſar,
Octauus Auguſtus, Marcus Antonius,
Septimius Seuerus, Marcus
Aurelius, and other in great
nombre, that were eſtemed in
their priuy buſynes, that is to
ſay, in the rulyng of the cōmon
wealth, wonders wittie: but we
reade that they were ſo negligent
in gouernyng their owne
houſholdes, their wiues &amp; their
family, that it is muche to their
ſhame and reproche: therfore
ſuche be ſene often to be good
to rule the common welth, that
be nothyng worth to gouerne

their owne, and had nede (if it
might be honeſtly ſayd) to haue
a ruler to rule them.
            
               Plutarch reporteth that the
noble &amp; valiāt capitain Niſeas
neuer loſt battell, but onely in
truſtyng to muche to his owne
witte &amp; iudgement. And if we
beleue Hiarcas ye Philoſopher,
it is more hurtfull to a manne
to ſtand in his owne conceipt,
then to phanſye a woman: for
in louyng a woman, a manne
hurteth but himſelfe: but in
ſtickyng to muche to his owne
phantaſy, it may redound to ye
hurt of a whole cōmon weale.
All this that is ſayd, ſhalbe to
admoniſh them that tary in the
court, to be cōuerſant with the
graue and ſage perſons, &amp; with
ſuche as be learned, and ſuche

as haue good experiēce: For ye
graue, learnes vertue: Scilēce
is a certaine guide to a man: &amp;
experience, is the conſūmacion
of all. For although the courtier
beyng young, be neuer ſo
ſage, graue, riche or in fauor, he
ſhall nede a father to counſail
him, a brother to perſuade him,
a guyde to teache him the way,
and a maiſter to inſtruct him,
and a corrector to puniſh him:
becauſe the miſchiefes, craftes,
&amp; wickednes doeth ſo abounde
in the court that it is impoſſible
that a man alone may defende
him from all, and vtterly
reſiſt theim. For in the court
there is none ſo high awaye to
deſtruccion as for a man to be
gouerned onely by himſelfe, &amp;
haue his owne ſwinge.
            
               
The court is a perpetuall
dreame, a botomeleſſe whorlepole,
an inchaunted phantaſy,
and a maſe: when he is in, he
cannot get out till he be morfounded.
One of the beſt remedyes
that the courtier may
get againſt ſo many euils, is to
haue a faythfull frende that
flatters him nothyng, but that
rather will correct and rebuke
him if he goe home late, if he
walke by night, if he be a falſe
player or whorehunter. But
where ſhall we fynde ſuche a
frende? For we ſe the frendſhip
in the court is commonly vſed
among yong courtiers in this
ſort, that ſo ſone as ii. or .iii. are
met together, ſtrayt fall they to
quarellyng, fightyng, ryoting,
ſo that there is rather occaſion

geuen to do euil, then good coū
               ſail
to refraine. Therfore he
that haunteth the court, it wer
mete that he had ſome frende to
whom without feare he might
common of his buſynes, &amp; that
the multitude be alſo to him
common frendes, but aboue al
one perfite frende.
            I would alſo he ſhould kepe
himſelfe from the conuerſacion
of ſedicious perſons, from collericke
perſons &amp; vacabondes,
for the raſcall ſorte will ſlaunder
and ſay, the kyng payeth
naught that thoſe be in fauour
haue all the ſwynge, that the
officers are proude, that mens
ſeruice is euil recompenſed, &amp;
the good vnknowen: With
theſe wordes &amp; ſuche other like
the pore courtiers forgettes to

ſerue &amp; begynne to murmure.
            Alſo the good chriſtian man
ought not to ceaſſe to amende
his life, for yt he hopeth to liue
long: although thoſe yt be olde
there occupy thēſelfes rather in
newe paſtance, then to correcte
their olde ſynnes. Ye ſhal fynde
theim that promiſe euery day
for to amende thēſelfes in their
age, &amp; yet neuertheles dye there
worſe then deuils: the cauſe is
that they all ſay we wil do and
yet neuer do. There be ſome
old dotyng fooles, whiche ſhal
bragge of the kinges &amp; princes
whiche they haue ſerued, of the
chaūgyng of offices yt thei haue
ſeen, and of the warres paſſed,
and of the great mutabilitie &amp;
chaunge of fortune. And yet
notwithſtandyng all that they

haue ſeen and endured, they be
as gredy of gaine, and delight
in yong and fooliſhe paſtymes
as though thei wer newe to begyn
to liue. Alas miſerable
men that in perpetual trauail,
and continuall ſorowe, and infinite
trouble haue paſſed their
liues, euen frō their fyrſt tyme
of knowlege (whiche is, xv. yeres)
to the time of manhod, and
then frō that tyme to their dotyng
age, &amp; all to haue gained
riches and increace in renoune:
not in all this tyme once remembre
that in the ſteade of
a true and perfite reſt, they
prepare for theim ſelues a hell
both for body and ſoule. The
courtier alſo ought not lightly
to complaine of aduerſities
whiche many tymes come to

him, thinking that oftentymes
(though it be our owne faulte)
we do cōplaine of thinges whiche
ſhould complaine of vs, if
they had a toungue.
            What tyme a man ſeeth him
ſelf baſe and is litle eſtemed, or
poore &amp; forgotten of the riche,
and deceiued of that he looked
ſurely to haue, incontinent he
curſes his fortune and lamentes
his euil: In ye meane while
it is not fortune that hath thus
ſerued him, but him ſelfe that
hath ſerched it and founde it.
Suche a manne thinkes to be
quickely riche, honored &amp; eſtemed,
yt ſhortely after ſeeth him
ſelfe poore, ouerthrowen, diſpiſed,
and blamed of all men, and
cannot reuenge himſelfe, but
onely ſay, he is vnfortunate &amp;

vnhappy to the worlde, &amp; that
it is miſhap: whiche is not ſo,
but his owne folly that makes
him to leaue the ſuretie of his
houſe and prepareth himſelf to
the hazard of fortune, and therfore
hath no cauſe to complain
but of himſelf whiche choſe the
waye to it. The beſt is, after
that a man purpoſeth himſelfe
to continue in the court, yt then
paciently he awayte and tarye
the tyme of auauncement or auaūtage
that he looketh for: or
els if he cannot paciently diſſē
               ble
with the tyme, let him not
remaine there, for contentacion
conſiſteth not in the place, but
in the ambicious heart, &amp; troubled
mynde. And take this for
a trueth, ye that be courtiers
that if .ii. or .iii. thinges ſuccede

to your purpoſe proſperouſſy,
there ſhall come a hundreth ouerthwarte
the ſhynnes, either
to you or to your frendes. For
notwithſtandyng that ye courtiers
doynges &amp; deſyres come
to good paſſe, there ſhalbe thinges
for his frend or felow that
goeth all awrye, wherby often
tymes he lamtēes ye hurt of his
frende, &amp; that whiche is denied
him more then the pleaſure he
hath of his owne happe: wherfore
there is alwayes lacke or
faute of contentacion. Wyll ye
any more? the beyng in court
or out of the court, ye ſhal here
no nother matter, then, what
newes at the court? what doeth
the kyng? where is he? where is
the counſail? and where lyeth
the officers of ye houſhold? and

this is moſt true, yt they which
deſyre to here ſuche newes, are
as deſirous to ſee newes: And
by this meanes the poore wene
to make theimſelues riche, the
riche the more to commaunde,
and the lordes ye more to rule.
O what a pleaſure is it for thē
to be in the court hopyng that
the kyng may knowe thē, that
thoſe that be fauor may dye, or
that fortune may chaunge, and
that they come forwarde? And
it foloweth, that in tariyng
the tyme, the tyme deceiueth
them, &amp; then death
taketh theim vnware.

            ¶That there is a ſmal nombre of
them that be good in the Court
and a great nombre of good
in the cōmon wealth.
            
               
                  PLutarch in ye boke
intitled De exilio
telleth of ye great
Kyng Ptolome
that hauyng on a
daye at ſupper with him ſeuen
Ambaſſadours of diuers prouinces,
moued a queſtion to
them, whiche of al their cōmon
welthes gonerned them ſelues
with beſt lawes and cuſtomes?
The ſayd ambaſſadours, were
Romayns, Carthaginiens, Ciciliens,
Rhodiens, Atheniens,
Lacedemoniens, &amp; Cicioniens:
among whō the queſtion was
effectually debated afore the
kyng, foraſmuche as euery one

of thē beyng affeccionate to his
countrey aleged the wiſeſt reaſon
yt he could. The good king
deſirous to knowe the trueth &amp;
the reſolucion of the queſtion
commaunded that euery one of
the Ambaſſadours ſhould tell
of the beſte lawes or cuſtomes
that were in their cōmon welth
thre pointes, and that therby it
might eſely be ſene whiche was
better ruled and deſerued more
praiſe. Then the ambaſſadour
of the Romaynes beganne and
ſayd, In Rome the temples be
honored, ye gouernours obeyed
and the euil chaſtiſed. The ambaſſadour
of Carthage ſayd in
Carthage the noble men neuer
ceaſe to prepare to the warre,
the poore people to traueil, and
the Philoſophers to teache.
            
               
The ambaſſadour of the Ciciliens
ſayd, In Cicill is true
iuſtice executed, trouth is beloued,
and equalitie praiſed. The
Ambaſſadour of the Rhodiens
ſayd, In Rhodes the olde men
are honeſt, the yong men ſhamfaſt,
and the women meke and
gentle. The Ambaſſadour of
the Atheniens ſayd, the Athenieus
do not conſent that ye riche
ſhould be parciall, nor ye meane
people idle, nor the gouernours
without learnyng. The ambaſſadour
of the Lacedemoniens
ſayd, in Lacedemony enuy
raines not becauſe al are equal
nor coueteouſnes becauſe all is
cōmon, nor idlenes becauſe all
men traueil. The Ambaſſadour
of Cicioniens ſayd, in Cicion
they receiue no ſtraūgers

inuētors of newes, nor Phiſious
that kyl the whole, nor aduocates
that makes the proceſſes
immortall.
            When kyng Ptolome and
his companye had heard theſe
ſo good and holy obſeruaūces,
he praiſed greatly the inſtitucion
of euery of theim, ſaiyng,
that he could not iudge whiche
was the beſt. This hiſtorie is
well worthy to be noted, and
better to be folowed: And I
beleue if in our dayes ſo many
ambaſſadours ſhuld mete, diſputing
as theſe did of their cō
               mon
welthes, thei ſhould finde
mo thynges to blame &amp; ſpeake
euil of (and that without compariſon)
then to praiſe &amp; commende.
In tymes paſſed the
kynges houſes were ſo well reformed,

the kynges themſelfes
ſo wiſe, and the gouernours ſo
moderate, that litle offēces wer
chaſtiſed, and once to thinke of
great offences forbidden: to the
entent that the chaſticement
ſhould be terrour to the euil, &amp;
the prohibicion a plaine aduice
vnto the good: It is not ſo in
our common welthes, where is
done ſo muche euil, and committed
ſo many bitter offēces &amp;
vnhappynes, that thoſe whiche
the auncientes did chaſtice for
deadly ſinnes by death, we diſſemble
theim to be but veniall:
the truans and wantons be ſo
entertained as though we lacked
theim: and not as mete to
be chaſed and dryuen away.
            My lady the widow or my maſires
that is maried, if they fall

to leude and wanton liuyng, ye
ſhal not fynde one that wil ſay
madā or maſtres ye do nought:
but rather ſixe hundreth that
ſhall procure her diſhonor.
            This is in our tyme, ſuche is
our faſhion and maners which
cauſeth euil: ſo that he is
more to be praiſed whiche may
be called good in our common
welth, then any of the Conſuls
of Rome, becauſe that in ye olde
time it was almoſt a monſtrus
thing to fynde one euil among
a hundreth, &amp; now it is a great
chaunce to fynde one good amongeſt
a hundreth.
            The holy ſcripture praiſeth
Abraham yt was iuſt in Calde,
Loth that was iuſt in Sodom
Danyel in Babylon, Toby in
Niniuie, and Neemyas in Damaſco.

And likewiſe may we
among this Cathalog of holy
men nomber ye good courtiers
if there be any, but it cannot be
foraſmuche as none goeth about
to moue the courtiers to
vertue, but that counſail them
to perdicion.
            There is in the court ſo many
vacabondes, ſo many players,
blaſphemers, &amp; deceiuers
that we may be abaſhed to ſee
ſuche a multitude: but it were
a noueltie to heare of the contrary,
for why? the worlde hath
nothing in hiſroſiers but thornes,
and for frutes of trees, but
leaues, for vynes but bryars, &amp;
in their garnerdes but ſtrawe,
and in their treaſures, but Alcumyn.
O golden worlde, O
world deſired, O world paſſed:
the difference betwixte you and

vs is, that afore you litle and
litle the worlde paſſeth, but afore
vs it is quite paſſed. In
the O worlde euery mā vndertaketh
to inuent, to do, to begin
and to make an ende of that he
will: and that whiche is worſt
of all, liueth as he will: but the
ende is right doubtfull. There
is litle to be truſted in the O
worlde. And contrary wiſe litle
to defende, litle to enioy, &amp; very
litle to kepe. There is many
thynges to be deſired, many
thynges to be amēded, &amp; many
thynges to be lamented. Our
aunceters had the Iron world,
but our worlde may wel be called
the dirtie worlde, becauſe it
kepeth vs continually in a filthy
myer, and alwayes we be
there in defiled and rayed.
         
         
            
            The .xiiii. Chapiter
            Of many offaires in the court, and
that there be better huſbandmen,
then commonly is of courtiers.
            
               THe Poet Homer hath
written of ye trauels
of Ʋlixes one of the
princes of the Grekes:
Quintus Curtius of Alexander
and Darius: Moyſes of
Ioſeph, And of them of Egipt:
Samuel of Dauid &amp; of Saul:
Titus Liuius, of the Romaines:
Thucidides of Iaſon, with ye
Minotaure: and Saluſt of
Iugurth &amp; Cathelyne. I then
willyng to folowe theſe good
auctors, haue vndertaken to
write the vnkynd trauailes of
the court that the courtiers of
our tyme haue which haue pacience
enough for to ſuffre thē,

and no wyſedome to auoyde
them: then it is not without a
cauſe if I do call the trauailes
of the court vnkynde, for they
be accuſtomed vnto it as the
olde horſes are to the packeſadle
and to the plough, ſyth that
the courtiers themſelfes do ſuffer
them ſo muche and haue no
profite therof. Some men wil
ſay that I am euil aduiſed becauſe
I write ye courtiers haue
not their eaſe, ſeyng that he yt
may attaine to be in the courte
is accompted to be fortunate.
But he abuſeth him ſelfe, if he
thinke that al ſuche as are out
of the court be beaſtes &amp; ignorant
perſons, and he only wiſe:
they rude &amp; he delicate: he honored
and they vile, they ſtāme
ryng and he eloquent.
            
               
If it were ſo that God would
that the moſt perfite men ſhuld
be in the court, it ſhuld be to vs
more then a faulte, not incontinētly
to be a courtier: knowing
that ther can be no better tyme
employed, then that whiche is
beſtowed in hearyng the wiſe &amp;
ſage men: but when all is ſayd
the places doeth not better the
men, but the men the places.
            God knowes (for example) how
many gentle and good honeſt
myndes labor in the villages,
and how many foles &amp; lubbers
bragge it in palaices. God
knoweth howe many well ordered
wittes and iudgementes
is hid in the villages, and how
many rude wittes and weake
braines face and brace in the
court. How many be there in ye
               
court the whiche although thei
haue offices, dignities, eſtates
&amp; preeminences, yet in the village
(after a maner of ſpeakyng)
with great pain they are
not able to rule .x. men. Howe
many come out of ye court correctors
of other, that thē ſelues
in the villages ſhould be corrected?
O how many thynges
is ſayd amonges the poore laborers
worthy to be noted? And
contrary, ſpoken afore princes
worthy to be mocked? O how
many is in the court that make
theim ſelues highly to be eſtemed,
not for to be honeſt &amp; diligent,
but to come in auctoritie?
And how many is there in the
village forgotten and not ſette
by, more for lacke of fauor then
for either lacke of witte or diligence:

The princes geue the
offices: Thoſe that be in fauor
haue the entry: nature the good
bloud: The parentes the patrimony:
and ye deſeruyng, honor:
but to be wiſe and ſage cōmeth
onely of God, and menne haue
not the power to take it away.
And if it were ſo that princes
might geue good witte to whō
they would, thei ſhould kepe it
for theimſelues, ſeyng they neuer
leeſe, but for lacke of knowlege.
I take it for an euil point
of ſuche as newly commeth frō
the court to ye village, &amp; beyng
there, rather vſe mockyng then
taſt the benefite therof. But in
the meane tyme, thou ſeeſt their
maner of life, yt is, to go to bed
at midnight and riſe at x. of the
clocke, &amp; in makyng ready till

noone, trimmyng their buſſhe,
or bearde, and ſettyng the cap
a wry. And all the day after, to
talke of his darlyng yt he hath
in the court, or of the battell of
Granado wher he did meruails.
And ſome there be of them that
will lye and bragge that they
were at the iorney of Pauay wt
the capitaine Antony Deleua:
at Tunes with the Emperour:
or at Turron wt Andrew Doria.
And for all his brabling he
was no better then a ruffian or
a zacar of Tholydo, or a knaue
of Cordoua. We haue reherſed
theſe thynges before written, to
cauſe our minion friſkers to
leaue mocking of the poore inhabitantes
of the village, eſtemyng
theim to be but fooles &amp;
lurdens. For I beleue, if my

maiſter the Emperor would baniſhe
all ye company of fooles,
I feare me he were like to dwel
alone in the court.
            Let vs ſay then, that very late
thei of ye court know themſelfes
and ye order of their life &amp; ꝓfeſſion,
I meane ye profeſſion of yt
religiō whiche thei kepe ſtraitly,
the whiche conſiſtes in this:
theipromiſe to pleaſe the deuil,
and to cōtent the court, and to
folowe the worlde: They promiſe
to be euer penſife, ſad and
ful of ſuſpicion: They promiſe
alwayes to be choppyng and
chaungyng, full of buſynes, to
bye, to ſel, to wepe, to ſinne, and
neuer to reforme themſelues:
They ꝓmiſe alſo to be iagged
and raggged, an hungred, indebted
and diſpiſed: They promiſe

to ſuffre rebukes of Lordes,
theft of their neighbours,
iniuries of collerike men, mockeries
of ye people, reproche of
their parentes: and finally,
miſſyng &amp; lackyng of frendes.
            Lo this is the profeſſion and
rule of the obſeruauntes of the
court: whiche I wyll not name
a rule, but a confuſion, not a
order but a diſorder, not a monaſtery,
but a hel, and a religiō
not of brethren, but of diſſolute
perſons: no pore Hermites but
coueteous worldely menne. O
pitie, O lacke of good iudgement.
The Oracle of Apollo
beyng aſked by the Ambaſſadours
of the Romaines where
lay the point for one to gouern
himſelf wel, The anſwer was,
for a manne to knowe well his

owne eſtate &amp; degree that therby
one may rule his deſires, &amp;
bridle his affecciōs. The courtier
deſiryng al, &amp; perceueryng
in nothyng, ſhall thinke in his
mynde, that if he get not in one
yere ſome fee or office, that it is
not for lacke of knowlege: but
as a perſon ignorant &amp; fooliſhe
blameth his fortune, and curſeth
the hour that euer he came
thether, wtout calling to mynd
that ye court is as ye Palme tre
whoſe rote is a feadome vnder
the ground, before that he ſhew
two fyngers brede of leaues aboue
the grounde. In like maner,
a man muſt be long in ſeruice
before he be promoted:
yet ſo muche reſteth that ye perſeueryng
&amp; abidyng by it, cauſeth
a man to hope: For to ſay

the trueth, it is ſeen, if there be
thre whiche deſerue more then
thei haue, there be thre hūdreth
that haue more then they deſerue.
O how ſeldome tymes
doeth fortune that ſhe ought
for to do? And how many tymes
fortunes hazard &amp; chaſice
doeth better then the aſſurance
of vertue? becauſe ſhe meaſures
her merites by ye euil lēgth
of opinion, and not by reaſon:
ſhe makes the water burne wt
               out
fyre, the knife to cutte with
out ſtele, the Candle to light
without flame, the myll to go
wtout water, &amp; the cauſe is only
her inconſtancy. If ſhe laugh
in ye court of any, it is but with
her eares, If ſhe wepe, it had
been better neuer for a man to
haue come out of his houſe: If

ſhe lifte any vppe aloft, it is to
throwe him doune againe lower
then he was: If ſometyme ſhe
diſſemble, it is to take one in a
trap. Let no man then truſt of
fortune, for ſhe is ſo variable,
that ſhe neuer holdeth her promiſe
of that ſhe geueth, neither
by worde nor yet by writyng
that ſhe maketh.
         
         
            The .xv. Chapiter
            ¶That among courtiers is neither
kept amitie nor fayth fulnes: And
howe muche the Court is full of
trauail, of enuye &amp; rancour.
            
               ONe of the moſt exceſſiue
trauailes amōg
the courtiers
is, that none is reſident
there wtout
he be hated or at the leſt that he
hate: that is not purſued or els

doteh purſue, that doeth not
mocke or els is mocked.
            And one vnhappy thyng is in
the court, many there be that
will do of their bonette to you,
that gladly would ſe your heades
of by the ſhoulders: And
ſuche there be that makes reuerence
vnto you that would
haue his legge broken to ſe you
dead and caried to your graue:
Is it not a great pitie to be cō
               uerſaunt
all daye together, to
laugh &amp; make merye one with
another, and yet haue mortall
hate? Is not this more then a
diſſimulaciō, to honor him whō
they would be glad to ſee led to
the gallous? One thyng for al,
it is ambicion &amp; to muche hope
of ſharpe and bitter fortune, &amp;
lacke of knowlege, of this, that

amitie well obſerued, is muche
worth to moderate a manne.
            What life, what fortune, what
taſt may he take yt ſeeth himſelf
daily preſent in the court, wher
is ſo muche theft, bribry, murders,
poyſoners, felons, &amp; traytours
ready to betray and ſell
a man, and he himſelf betrayed
and ſolde? And contrarywyſe
what felicitie is it to be in the
companye of thoſe, with whom
a man may faythfully recreate
himſelfe fearyng noman? In
the court, there be gentlemen ſo
rooted in vengeaunce &amp; hatred
that by no meane, requeſt, nor
gentlenes a manne may direct
them frō their euil ententes, in
ſuche maner that they be glad
to make warre with their owne
houſes, to chaſe peace frō them

ſelues to the houſes of their enemies?
Wherby one may wel
preſuppoſe as is aforſayd, that
vnneth one may hope to haue
frendes in the court, and leſſe
truſt: and the greater menne in
auctoritie, ye more afrayde they
be to fall. What then cauſes a
man there to tary in ſuche trauail?
I haue wonder that any
can ſuffre it or haue a heart to
diſſemble it. O how fortunate
is he that leadeth his life in the
village, with ye meane buſynes
of his litle poſſeſſion, in compariſon
of y• courtier whoſe eſtate
is euer vnhappy &amp; of al partes
miſerable, that neuer ceaſes to
hope of thynges vaine, in procuryng
vniuſt thinges &amp; ſuche
thynges that neuer can be determined.
And if thoughtes

were wynde, &amp; his deſires waters,
it ſhould be greater daunger
to ſaile in his heart then in
the maine ſea. In the court is
one thyng I wotte not what, &amp;
one thyng I knowe not howe,
and one thyng I vnderſtande
not, whiche cauſeth there inceſſauntly
complaintes, and continuall
choppyng and chaungyng,
and euermore diſpite &amp;
enuy: and that worſt is there is
no libertie to depart thence.
            The yoke of the court is hard,
the bondes faſte tyed and the
plough ſo tedious that thoſe
that wene to be the firſt to tryumph,
are the firſt that labor &amp;
drawe the weightie burdens.
And ſuche as are poore &amp; ignoraunt
men ſuffre theſe intollerable
trauailes, becauſe they

would not be as ſubiectes in
their owne countreys, and to
haue a greater libertie to do
euil. But God knowes what
ſuche libertie coſteth them, that
for a ſhorte and vaine pleaſure
purchaſe to theimſelues, continual
trauail and perpetual bō
               dage.
The propertie of this
vicious libertie, or better to cal
it, this miſcheuous ſubieccion,
is, that at the beginnyng it ſemeth
ſomewhat pleaſaunt: but
in the ende al cōuertes to a bitternes,
ſorow, and lamētacion,
chiefly when a man hath experience
by litle &amp; litle of the vice
that this life conteyneth. For if
he accompany with women, he
muſt flatter them, ſerue them, &amp;
intreate theim: And if money
lacke, then muſt there be ſome
deuiliſhe ſhift made.
            
               
deuiliſhe nede. For why, when
one commeth new to the court,
my lady dame gorgious, ledes
him a trayne, ſhe entertaynes
him, ſhe makes muche on him,
ſhe colles him: but when ſhe
ſpyeth him to lacke, ſhe ſendes
him to paſture in the bare fieldes.
And if the tyme of eatyng
come, the courtier muſt often
tymes fede with them, whom he
would ſee eaten without ſauce▪
Nowe, if his turne be to playe,
therin is litle profite: if he wyn,
he muſt liberally departe with
the gaine to thoſe that ſtād by:
&amp; if he looſe, they reſtore to him
neuer a penny. And if the courtiers
turne be to ieſt, and to be
mery, therin he findeth no fruit
for the courtiers playe beginneth
in fayre wordes, &amp; endes

with braulyng, chidyng, &amp; fightyng.
And foraſmuche as it is
the worſt life of al other lyues:
Let vs conclude that there is
nothyng worſe then a vaine
courtier, &amp; an idle huſbandmā.
         
         
            The .xvi. Chapiter.
            By how muche the comon welthes
and the courtes of the tyme paſſed
wer more perfite then the courtes
of the tyme preſent,
            
               THe kyng Anchyſes
did lament ye diſtruccion
of the proude
Troye, done by the
princes of Greece: The Quene
Roſaine bewailed her huſband
Darius, when he was ouercome
by the great Alexander.
            Ieremy the prophet cōplained
the eſtate of Babylon, when it
was helde captiue. Kyng Dauid

lamented his ſoonne Abſolon
when Ioab kilde him. The
lady Cleopatra thought no nother
but to dye for ſorow when
her deare &amp; welbeloued Marcus
Antonius was vanquiſhed
by the Emperour Auguſtus.
            
            The Conſul Marcus Marcellus
lamented the citie of Syracuſe
when he ſawe it on a fyre. Saluſt,
Rome, euil gouerned. The
Patriarche Iacob his ſoonne
Ioſeph: The kyng Demetrius
his good father Antigonus whē
he founde him dead at the battail
of Marathone. It ſhalbe
alſo conuenient that amonges
theſe wel renoumed princes we
ſhould lament the miſeries of
our tyme, in the whiche we ſee
thynges ſo merueilous, that ye
curious auctours of the tyme

paſſed neuer wrote thynges ſē
               blable
vnto them: Nor the men
in thoſe dayes neuer ſawe the
like. Truth it is that the Chroniclers
in thoſe dayes wrote
what they would, In our tyme
ſcant any man dare ſpeake.
            The Philoſopher Ariminius
hath written of ye aboundaunce
of Egipt: Demophō
                of the fartilitie
of Arabia: Thucidides of
the treaſures of Tyrus: Aſclepius
of the Mynes of Europe:
Dodrillus in the commendacion
and praiſynges of Grece: Leonides
of the triumphes of Thebes:
Eumenides of the gouernement
of Athens: Theſiphontes
of the order that is kepte in the
court, and of ye princely houſes
of the Sicioniens: Pytheas of
the profite that came by ye lytle

ſpeaking of the diſciples of Socrates:
Apollinus of the continencie
and abſtinence that was
kepte in ſchooles of the diuine
Plato: Myronides of the great
exerciſe, and of the litle reſt that
was in the houſe of Hyarcas:
Aulus Gelyus of ye temperance
and litle eatyng, and of the moderate
ſlepyng of the diſciples
of maiſter Fauorimus: Plutarch
of the wiſe women of Greece, &amp;
of the chaſte wyues of Rome:
Dyodorus, how thoſe that were
inhabitantes in ye Iſles of Balyares
caſte their treaſure into
the ſea for feare leſt the ſtraungers
for coueteouſnes of their
riches ſhuld make thē warres,
and to the entent alſo that no
parcialitie ſhuld grow among
themſelues.
            
               
Hearyng then all this that
that I haue ſayd, I demaunde
of the reader his aduiſe what
my penne ſhould write of our
tyme? If we ſhould write of
bountie and veritie, we ſhould
falſely lye: If of riches, men be
ſo gredy that all be diſpoſed to
deſyre and hunger couetouſly.
How ſhal we then praiſe ye men
of our tyme? Shal we ſay they
be hardy and puiſſaunt &amp; learned,
and we ſe that thei employ
their myndes to nothyng els
but to robbe and beguile eche
one the other? How ſhall we
praiſe theim of proſperitie and
helth, ſeyng that the peſtilence
and the Frenche pockes more
then common is among them?
How ſhall we commende their
continencie &amp; abſtinence, ſeyng

that ſcant in fiftie yeres ye ſhal
not fynde one that will bridle
his luſt and deſyre? Shall we
praiſe theim of litle reſt and of
muche exerciſe, when we ſe that
there is a greater nombre that
geue themſelfes to idlenes and
thefery, then to honeſt trauels
&amp; paines? How ſhall we praiſe
them of temperat eatyng, when
we ſee in our dayes the belly is
mennes God? How ſhall we cō
               mend
theim for hauyng chaſt
women and obediēt, ſeyng that
there is nothyng more cōmon
among them then adultry?
            Shal we ſay, they be not couetous,
ſeyng that not onely men
ſerche golde and ſyluer in depe
mynes, but men trauail to ſeke
it as farre as the Indiens, of a
vyneyarde ſo froſon, of a tre ſo

dry, of fruit ſo vnripe, of a water
ſo troubled, of bread ſo euil
bakē, of ſo much falſe gold, of a
world ſo ſuſpicious, what ſhal
we hope any other thereof but
euil &amp; confuſion? Let vs reade
that is written of the courtes
of the princes of Siria, of Percia
of Macedonia, of Grecia, and finally
of the Romaines: And let
vs cōferre theſe to our courtes,
and ye ſhal ſee ſuche euils and
vicious cuſtomes in our common
welthes, that the auncientes
did neuer attaine to ye knowlege
how to committe ſuche abhominacions,
nor yet (I ſay) to
inuēt ſuch euils. In thoſe moſt
happy times &amp; golden worldes
an euil condicioned man ſcant
durſt to haue ſhewed himſelfe
in any honeſt cōpany: but now

alas (a thing to be lamēted) the
worlde is ſo repleniſhed with
diſſolute &amp; corrupt liuyng, that
it is counted but a ſmall faulte
to be euil, excepte he be ſuche a
one as is paſt al ſhame &amp; grace.
The courtiers wil not deny me
but that whiles they geue attē
               dance
for the vpriſyng of their
maiſters, they tell eche one the
other what paſtyme they haue
had the night before, how they
haue plaied, ſworne and ſtared
at their game, of their laughynges,
and the cōpanies they
haue had wt the gentle dames:
which of them was fayreſt and
beſt apparelled? and ſometyme
in ſecret of thoſe that they haue
committed adultery withal.
            And thus, as the worlde is
newe, the inuēcions are newe, ye
               
playes new, the garmētes new,
newe ſpeakyng, newe maners,
&amp; new euery yere, euery moneth
ye and euery day, &amp; euery hour:
we ſee vices ſo largely delated,
and vertue ſo diminiſhed, that
I am aſhamed to write it: And
the true cauſe is, that in ye court
vertue hath many controllers
and enemies, and vice innumerable
vpholders and maynteiners.
For if there be brought
into the court one laudable cuſtome,
it is no ſoner come, but
furthwith it is chaſed awaye:
And on the other part, vice can
not ſo ſone appeare, but it is as
ſoone embraced &amp; entertained.
The ſage lawyer Lygurgus did
defend expreſſely by a law that
the ſtraūgers ſhuld not knowe
the ſecretes of his cōmon welth

nor that his citezens ſhould
meddle muche abrode, for that
purpoſe as is ſaid, that in medlyng
with them, they ſhuld not
learne their vices nor their barberous
condicions.
            In the tyme when Marcus
Portius was Conſull, ther came
an excellent Muſician out of
Grece into Rome, whiche for
becauſe that he put one ſtryng
more on his harpe then was accuſtomed
to be plaied withall,
he was by the conſent of ye people
baniſhed from Rome &amp; his
harpe burnte: Howbeit in this
our tyme, we could well agree
with Muſique, and would not
paſſe how many ſtynges the
harpe had: ſo that men might
agree and ſtay theim ſelues.
            
               Plutarch ſayth that he ſaw once

at Rome a prieſt of Grece ſtoned
to death in the great place
of Campus Marcus, becauſe that
he did ſacrifice to the Goddeſſe
Berecinthe in other maner then
they were accuſtomed to be ſacrificed
vnto. Suetonius affirmeth
that in .iiii.C.lxiiii. yeres
whiche was the tyme that the
temple Vierges Vaſtales endured,
there was neuer found but
iiii. euil liuyng perſons, whiche
were Domicia, Rhea, Albina
&amp; Cornelia, the whiche for their
offences were openly buryed
quicke. If at this daye one
would regiſtre the names of
ſuche like, to be ſo puniſhed, I
leaue it to your iudgemēt whether
there ſhuld lacke hāgmen
to do execucion. Trebelius Publius
ſayd that the Emperoure

               Aurilianus Quintus toke a gret
frende of his from the office of
Dictator, whiche was named
Rogerius, onely becauſe he had
daunſed at the weddyng of Poſteria
Auia his nigh neighbour
ſaiyng, that the good Iudge
ſhould not leaue his grauitie &amp;
vſe ſuche wilde and common
plaies. But ſo it is, whatſoeuer
this Emperour ſayd, In our
tyme we will geue licence to
iudges to remeue their feete as
faſt as they will, ſo that they
holde their handes ſtil. It ſhal
make no matter to the poore
pleader whether his iudge ſing
or daunce, ſo that he miniſtre
iuſtice with expedicion, that the
the poore man come not often
tymes and geue to muche attendaunce.
In this caſe it were

very good to rayſe ye Emperor
Domitian, whiche as Suetonius
writeth made a lawe, that whoſoeuer
prolonged the proces of
his clyant more then one yere,
that he ſhould for euer be baniſhed
Rome. If this holy
lawe had dured to this daye,
there ſhuld haue been more baniſhed
in Rome and els where,
then there are now citezens.
         
         
            The .xvii. Chapiter.
            Of diuers noble and valiaunt men,
that left the court &amp; the great cities
and drewe theim to their proper
houſes, more by wil, then by
neceſſitie.
            
               
                  MArcus Craſſus a captaine
of the Romaines,
was greatly cō
               mended
and praiſed
for that he was valiaunt in the

warre, and wiſe in the buſynes
of his houſholde: This is that
Craſſus that folowed the parcialitie
of ye Conſull Silla againſt
Marius and Iulius Caeſar after
Dictator. It chaunſed on a
tyme that by the fortune of the
ſea, the ſayd Caeſar was priſoner
to certain pyrates and robbers
of the ſea, and he ſayd boldly to
ii. or. iii. of the beſt of them that
kept him faſt bounde, It doeth
(ſayd he) greue me muche, not
for that I am taken priſoner,
foraſmuche as that is but hazard
of the warre, but of ye pleaſure
that myne enemye Craſſus
will take when he doeth heare
of ye newes. This Craſſus was
Maiſter to a Philoſopher named
Alexandrius, that gouerned
him as a father, counſailed

him as a frēde, and taught him
as a maſter: And this did he by
the ſpace of .xviii. yeres, whiche
paſſed, then he demaunded licence
to returne to his coūtrey:
And goyng his way, ſayd theſe
wordes vnto Alexāder: I aſke
of the none other rewarde for
my payne, nor for my labors in
teachyng of thee, then to graūt
that I ſhall neuer returne to
the court againe: &amp; when I am
gone that thou wilt neuer write
vnto me of thyne affaires, for yt
I am ſo wery of beyng a courtier,
that I wil not onely leaue
the court, but alſo forgettt all
that euer I ſawe or heard in it.
Denis of Siracuſe, albeit that he
was a cruel tyrant, yet notwithſtanding
he was a great frende
to the Philoſophers, and a honorer

of wiſe men. And he ſayd
that he toke muche pleaſure to
heare of the wiſe and ſage men
of Grece, but he beleued theim
not, becauſe their teachynges
were wordes without dedes.
Seuen of the moſte ſageſt and
beſte learned of Grece came to
Siracuſe a citie where the ſayd
Denys was reſident: that is to
ſay, Plato, Chylo, Demophon,
Diogenes, Myrtho, Pyllades and
Surranus the whiche medled
more of ye affaires of Denis then
he did of their doctrin. Dyogenes
dwelled a xi. ycre with him,
and after returned to his coū
               trey,
where he beyng &amp; waſhing
of herbes for his diner, another
Philoſopher ſayd to him: If
thou haddeſt not left ye ſeruice
of Denis thou needeſt not now

to haue taken ye paine to waſhe
thyne owne herbes and make
them redy for thy dyner. To
whom Dyogines anſwered: If
thou couldeſt haue been cōtent
to haue waſhed &amp; eatē herbes: yu
nedeſt not at this tyme to haue
been in the court of Dioniſius.
Cato the Cenſor of whom the
names of Cato fyrſt began, was
eſtemed for one of the wyſeſt of
the Romaines: And he was neuer
ſene in .lxviii. yeres (for ſo
lōg he liued) not once to laugh
nor to do any thing repugnant
to his ſage grauitie. Plutarch
ſayeth that he was in ſpeakyng
prudent, gentle in cōuerſacion,
in correctyng ſharpe &amp; ſeuere,
in preſentes liberall, in eatyng
ſober, and in that that he promiſed,
ſure and certain, &amp; in executing

iuſtice irreprehenſible.
            After the age of .lv. yeres he
lefte the court of Rome, &amp; with
drewe himſelf to a litle village
nigh to Picene, which is now at
this preſēt called Puzol: &amp; there
he paſſed ye reſidue of his yeres
in quiet and reſt, accompanyed
only with his bokes, &amp; takyng
for a ſinguler recreacion for to
go twiſe or thriſe a day to walk
in the fayre fieldes &amp; the vines,
&amp; himſelfe oft to labor in them.
And it fortuned on a day when
he was abſent from his houſe
that one wrote with a cole vpō
his doore O felix Cato, tu ſolus
ſcis viuere, whiche is to ſay, O
happy Cato, thou only knoweſt
how to liue.
            
               Lucullus Conſull and capitain,
a Romain, right valiant,

brought to an end the warre againſt
the Parthes whiche had
continued by the ſpace of .xvi.
yeres, wherby he gat great honor
of the citezens of Rome, &amp;
immortall renoune for himſelf
and great riches for his family.
And it is ſayd of him, that he
onely of all the Romaines did
enioy peaceably in his age, the
riches that he had wōne in his
youth in the warres. And after
when he came from Aſia &amp; ſaw
that the common welth was in
deuiſion betwixt Marius &amp; Silla,
he determined to leaue Rome &amp;
make a houſe in the countrey
nigh to Naples vpon the ſea
ſyde (nowe at this preſent tyme
called ye Caſtel of Lobo) which
he edified and liued there xviii.
yeres in great tranquilitie. His

houſe was haunted with many
people, ſpecially with great capitaines
that went into Aſia,
and with Ambaſſadours that
came from Rome, whiche he receiued
very gently &amp; benignly.
One night when his ſeruauntes
had made ready his ſupper
with a leſſe dyet then he was
accuſtomed to haue, they excuſyng
theimſelues that they ordained
the leſſe becauſe he had
no ſtraungers: He ſayd vnto
theim, although ſayd he, that
there be no ſtraūgers with me,
knowe not you that Lucullus
muſt ſuppe with Lucullus.
            
            
               Plutarch ſpeakyng of this valiaunt
mannes exerciſe that he
did after he was retired to the
place aforeſayd, ſayeth that he
delited muche in huntyng and

hawkyng, but aboue all pleaſures
he moſt delited in his Library,
there reading and diſputyng
inceſſantly. Helius Spertianus
ſayth that Diocleſian, after
that he had gouerned the
Empyre xviii. yeres, forſoke it,
and wente to take his pleaſure
in the fieldes, there in quiet to
ende the reſidue of his life, ſaiyng:
that it was tyme for him
to leaue ye daūgerous eſtate of
the court &amp; get him to a peaceable
life in the village. Two
yeres after he was thence retyred,
ye Romaines ſent vnto him
a ſolemne Ambaſſade to inuite
and deſire him effectuouſly that
he would take pitie of ye cōmon
welth, and returne, promiſyng
him that ſo long as they liued
there ſhould none haue the name

of Emperour but he. Nowe
when ye Ambaſſadours ariued
at his houſe, they found him in
a litle garden wher he was ſettyng
of Lettys and Onyons:
And hearyng what they ſayd
vnto him, he anſwered in this
wiſe: Do you not thynke my
frendes, that it is muche better
for him that can ſowe his Lettys,
and afterwarde pleaſantly
and merely to eate theſame, ſo
ſtill to exerciſe himſelfe, then to
returne &amp; entre into the goulfe
of troubles in a cōmon welth?
I haue aſſaied bothe, I knowe
what it is to commaunde in the
court, and what it is to liue &amp;
labor in the village, wherfore
I pray you ſuffre me here to abide
in pacienee, for I deſire rather
here to liue with the labor

of my hādes, then in the ſorow
and cares of an Empire. Note
by this example that the life of
the laborer is more to be deſired,
then the life of a prince.
            
               Cleo and Pericles ſucceded
in the rulyng of the common
welth after Solon, a man excellently
lerned and wel eſtemed,
and taken among the Greciās
for half a God, by the reaſon of
the wyſe lawes he made amōg
the Atheniens: Theſe two noble
gouernours were muche be
loued, becauſe that (as Plutarch
telleth) Pericles whiche .xxx. yeres
had the adminiſtraciō of ye
buſines and affaires of ye citie,
was neuer ſene to come into any
mans houſe but his owne,
nor yet to ſit in any open place
among ye cōmon people, ſuche

a grauitie was in him.
            Aboute the yeres of his age
whiche was .lx. he went from
Athens to a litle village, where
he ended the reſt of his dayes,
ſtudiyng and paſſing the tyme
in huſbandrye: He had a litle
ſmall gate or wicket in the entryng
of his houſe, ouer which
was written Inueni portū, ſpes,
&amp; fortuna valete. That is to
ſay, foraſmuche as now (and before
I haue knowlege of vanitee)
I haue founde the porte of
reſt, fye of hope, and fortune
farewell. By this example, no
courtier can ſay that he leadeth
a ſure life, but onely that courtier
whiche doeth as this wyſe
captain did, withdraw himſelf.
            
               Lucius Seneca, was as who
ſhuld ſay, a right leder to good

maners, &amp; a inſtructer to good
letters to Nero the ſixt Emperour
of Rome, with whom he
taried .xxiiii. yeres, &amp; had great
doynges of thīges pertainyng
to the cōmon wealth, as well of
priuate cauſes as otherwyſe, becauſe
he was ſage and of great
experience. And at the laſt, cō
               myng
to great age and weryed
with the continual conflictes &amp;
buſyneſſe of the court, lefte the
court and went and dwelt in a
litle mancion he had nigh to
Nole Campana, where he liued
after, a long tyme as witneſſeth
his bookes De officiis, de Ira,
de bono viro, de aduerſa fortuna
and other bookes whiche were
to long to reherſe. At laſt (fortune
and mannes malice did
their office) Nero cōmaunded

him to be ſlaine, not for that he
had committed any crime worthy
to dye, or done any thing otherwiſe
then an honeſt manne
ought to do: but onely becauſe
the lecherous Domicia hated
him: Note well reader this example,
that ſometyme fortune
purſueth him that forſaketh ye
court, aſwel as the courtier.
            
               Scipio the Affrican was ſo eſtemed
among ye Romaines, that
in .xxii. yeres, whiles yt he was
in the warres he neuer loſt battell:
And yet made he warre in
Aſia, Europ, and Affrica, and
to this, neuer committed acte
worthy of reproche: And yet
he wan Africa and put to ſacke
Carthage, brought in bōdage
Numance, ouercame Hannibal,
and reſtored Rome weakened

and nere deſtroyed by the loſſe
they had at ye battail of Cānes.
And yet for all this, beyng of ye
yeres of. lii. he withdrewe him
frō the court of Rome to a litle
village betwixte Puzoll and
Capua, where he liued a ſolitary
life, and ſo content withal,
that whiles he taried there a xi.
yeres ſpace, he neuer entred into
Rome nor Capua.
            
            The diuine Plato was borne
in Liconia, and was noriſhed in
Egipt, and learned in Athens:
It is red of him, that he anſwered
ye Ambaſſadours of Cirene
that required of him lawes to
gouerne theim ſelues in ſure
peace, in this wiſe: Difficilimū
eſt homines ampliſſima fortuna
ditatos legibus cōtinere. Which
is to vnderſtand, that it is hard

to bryng to paſſe to make riche
men to be ſubiect to the rigour
of the lawe. To conclude, Plato
not willyng to abide lōger the
clamor &amp; cry of the court, went
and dwelt in a litle village two
myles frō Athens called Academia,
where the good old man
after he had taryed there. xiiii.
yeres, teachyng and writyng
many notable doctrines, ended
there his moſte happye dayes.
After the memorye of him, the
aūcientes called yt village Academia,
whiche is to ſay in Engliſh,
a ſchole: The cōcluſion is
that all theſe honourable ſage
princes &amp; wiſe menne, left Monarchies,
kyngdomes, cities, &amp;
great riches, and went into the
villages, there to ſerche a pore,
an honeſt, &amp; a peaceable life.
            
               
Not that I will ſaye that ſome
of theſe lefte ye court, to be there
poore and baniſhed and rebuked,
but of their fre wil and fre
libertie, minding to liue a quiet
and honeſt life or they dyed.
         
         
            The. xviii. Chapiter.
            ¶The Aucthor complaineth with
great reaſon, of the yeres that
he loſt in the court.
            
               I Wyl demaunde of
myne owne ſelfe,
mine owne life, and
make accoumpt of
theſame, to the entent
that I will conferre my
yeres to my traueiles, and my
trauailes to my yeres, that it
may appeare how long I lefte
of to liue, and beganne to dye.
            My life (gentle reader) hath

not been a life, but a lōg death:
my daies a play new for to begyn:
my yeres a very tedious
dreame: my pleaſures Scorpions:
my youth a tranſitorie fā
               taſy.
My proſperitie hath been
no proſperitie: but properly to
ſpeake, a painted caſtell, and a
treaſure of Alcumyn.
            I came to ye court very yong,
where I ſaw diuers maners of
offices and chaunges, euen among
ye princes that I ſerued.
And I haue aſſayed to trauail
by ſea and by lande, and my recompence
was much more then
I deſerued: and that was this,
that ſometyme I was in fauor,
and ſometyme out of fauor. I
haue had experience of ye ſomerſautes
of deſtines: I haue had
in the court frēdes &amp; enemies:

I haue had falſe reportes: I
haue been euen nowe glad and
mery, and furth with ſadde and
ſory: to daye riche, to morowe
poore: now mounted vpward,
&amp; ſtraite throwen dounewarde:
This hath been to me a maſkyng,
where I haue loſte both
money and tyme. And nowe I
ſaye to the my ſoule, what haſt
thou gotten of this great iorney?
The recompence is this,
that I haue gotten there a gray
head, fete ful of ye goute: mouth
wtout tethe: raines full of grauel:
my goodes layd to pledge:
my body charged wt thought:
and my ſoule litle clenſed from
ſynne. And yet is there more
ſeyng yt I muſt nedes ſpeake,
that is, that I haue returned
my body ſo wery, my iudgemēt

dull, my tyme ſo loſt, the beſt of
my age ſo paſſed, and that is
worſt of al, I founde no taſt in
any thing that is in the worlde:
ſo that to conclude, I am of my
ſelfe al wery of my ſelfe. What
ſhould I more tell or ſay of the
alteracion of my life, and of the
chaunges of fortune? I came
to the court innocent, and come
from it malicious: I went thither
true and meanyng truth, &amp;
returned a lyar: I went thither
humble, &amp; returned preſumptuous:
I wēt thither ſobre, and
returned a gurmand &amp; gluttō:
I wente thither gentle and humaine,
and returned cleane cō
               trary.
Finally in goyng thither
I marde my ſelf in all pointes:
And I haue no cauſe to laye y•
faut in my maſters, for ye vices

ſoone learned wtout a maſter, &amp;
cannot be forgotten without a
corrector. O miſerable that I
am, I kept in the court an accompt
of my goodes, to knowe
how they were waſted, and not
for to diſtribute theim to the
poore: I toke hede of my honor
for to encreaſe it, not for to better
my ſelfe by the tyme: I toke
care of them that ſhuld pay me,
to know what was owyng me,
and not that I might gette to
profite the poore withal, but to
ꝓfite in riches and not in vertue.
I helde an accoumpt with
my ſeruauntes, to none other
purpoſe, then to know how lōg
thei had been with me &amp; ſerued
me, &amp; not to enquire what life
thei led: Finally, I held a coūpt
of my life, but it was more to

conſerue it, then to correct it.
            Lo, beholde, this was my accoumpt,
this was my calculacion,
this was the Arſmetrique
that I learned in the court.
            Let vs yet go a litle further
and ſe mine exerciſes. I neuer
was yet in the court but I foūd
to whom I bare malice, or els
that enuied me. I was neuer
yet in the palaice but I founde
a window open, and a courtier
murmur. I neuer yet ſpake to
princes, but I went from them
not cōtented in my mynde with
ſome parte of their anſwere. I
neuer yet went to bed without
complaint, nor neuer did ryſe
wtout a ſigh. If I went about
to do any good thing, my great
affaires hyndered me. If I
would ſtudy, my felowes letted

me. If I went to take any honeſt
and quiet paſtyme, myne
affaires would not permit me.
If I kept my ſelfe ſolitary and
from companye, my thoughtes
martyred me: Finally ther was
neuer any thyng that ſo vexed
my heart as the lacke of money
in my purſe. And yet all this is
nothyng, remembryng that I
was euer enuyous to ſuche as
were myne equalles: a flatterer
to my ſuperiors, and without
pitie to mine inferiors: &amp; where
I phanſied one, I bare hate almoſt
to all other. I found euery
man worthy of reprofe, but
againſt my ſelfe I could not
ſuffre a worde to be ſpoken. O
howe forgetfull haue I been,
whiche ſhould forget or a morſell
of meate had been put in

my mouth, and haue talked aloude
to my ſelf alone, as it had
been one that had been mad? O
how often hath chaunced me yt
in commyng from the counſail
wery, or frō ye palaice thoughtfull,
I would not heare myne
owne ſeruaūres ſpeake, nor diſpatche
ſuche as I had to do wt
               all?
O how many tymes haue
I been ſo drouned in buſynes,
that I could not moderate my
penſiuenes, although my frendes
did counſail me to the contrary?
O alas, how many times
hath my mynde preſſed me to
leaue the court and the worlde,
and to yelde my ſelfe to ſome
ſolitary deſert, as an Heremite?
becauſe I ſawe ye kyng auaūce
him and him, and I put backe
as a perſon halfe deſperate.
            
               
Moreouer to fulfil my trauailes,
alwaies I wente aſkyng &amp;
ſerchyng newes of the affaires
of ye court: alwaies harkenyng
what one ſayd of another: alwaies
ſpiyng and watchyng: &amp;
all this conſidered, I found by
myne accoumpt, that I liued in
heauynes, captiuitie, and ſtate
of damnacion.
            Let vs yet go farther: If I
were riche, one or other ſerched
ſome meane to deuour me: If
I were poore, I found none to
ſuccour me: my frendes cryed
out vpō me, and mine enemies
ſought my death. Ouermuche
bablyng of the courtiers brake
my braines: and muche ſilence
made me to ſlepe, and the ſolicitude
cauſed me to be ſad: And
ouermuche company oppreſſed

me: muche exerciſe weryed me,
and idlenes confounded me.
            To cōclude, I ſo burdened and
vexed my ſelf in the court with
ſo muche trauail in naughtynes,
yt I durſt not deſire death,
although I had no deſire to
liue.
         
         
            The .xix. Chapiter.
            The aucthor maketh accoumpt of
the vertues that he loſt in the court,
and of the euil cuſtomes that he
learned there,
            
               BVt nowe to procede,
my fortune
paſſed, my frēdes
dyed, my force decaied,
and my firſt
faſhiōs failed: O
if al my paines had been ended
at the firſt tyme when I came

to the courte, howe happye had
that been for me? but nowe all
conſumed, I complaine ſingulerly
of my traitorous hearte,
which would neuer ceaſe to deſire
vain thinges, and the curſed
tong to ſpeake ſclaūderous
thīges. O gentle reader, be not
wery, if I tel thee in fewe wordes
the difference betwixte him
that I was when I went firſt
to the court, &amp; that I am nowe
ſince I haue been in the court.
Firſt and before that I did caſt
my ſelfe into this perilous labyrinthe
(which is to ſay a priſon
full of all ſnares) I was a
good deuout perſon, gētle and
fearefull: and ſince I haue lerned
to be a miſchieuous felow,
ſlowe in doyng good, and litle
or nothing regardyng ye welth

of my ſoule. I went thether beyng
very yong and of good diſpoſicion,
and came from thence
deffe, &amp; more then ſpurblynde,
and nomore able to go then he
that is full of the goute: And
briefely and olde gryſard, ful of
ambicion, in ſuche wyſe, that I
am ſo variable, that ſcant I
knowe on what grounde to ſet
my feete. My heart was of ſo
depraued a ſort, that it deſired
to be diſcharged of all accions,
and yet for all that founde no
nother but peril and torment.
            Sondry tymes I purpoſed to
leaue the court, and ſodenly I
repented. Sometyme I purpoſed
not to come out of my
lodgyng, &amp; ſtrait waies I was
enforced to trot a trot to the
court. Sometyme I purpoſed

not to come to the palaice, and
or I were ware I was compelled
to go thither ſometyme
or it were day. I purpoſed to
be nomore vexed, &amp; ſodenly my
paſſions augmēted, And it folowed
that my good purpoſes
ceaſed and went frō me: and I
did that was leude &amp; naughty.
Behold how I liued of wynde
and of fooles imaginacions as
many a fooliſhe courtier doth.
I haue phātaſied with my ſelf
(in the court ſometyme) that I
gouerned the kyng &amp; the princes,
and that I came of a noble
houſe and auncient ſtocke, excellent
in ſciēce, great in fauor
and beloued of all men, ſage in
counſail, moderate in ſpeaking
eloquent in writyng, prudent
in ſeruice, and conformable to

all. But when I waked out of
my folly as from a dreame, and
looked to my feete, I knewe
eaſly that I had born falſe witnes
to my ſelfe of this golden &amp;
pleaſāt imaginacion, &amp; ſawe of
truth in other, ye which I dreamyngly
imagined of my ſelfe.
            I ſerched the waie how to be
eſtemed of euery mā, holy, wiſe,
gentle, cōtent, &amp; of a good zele,
and a ſea of ſadnes. Lo this
faulte happeneth to courtiers
as it did vnto me, yt is, to ioyne
foliſhe libertie with vertuous
honor, whiche be two thinges
that cannot agree, becauſe that
diſordinate will is enemye to
vertue and honor. But for my
part good reader, I geue thankes
vnto God, my affeccions
be ſomewhat waſted and mortified,

for I was woont 
                  〈◊〉
               
in ſeruice, to deſire daily t
                  •

neuer I come from my h
                  •
               ſe
I had a ſpeciall luſt to 
                  〈◊◊〉
               
for newes, And now I care n
                  ••
               
for them at all. I ſaw the tyme
when I loued not to be out of
company, And now I deſire no
thyng more then to be ſolitary.
I was wont to delite to heare,
to ſee iuglers, daunſers, lyars,
and daliars: And now ſo to do,
wer to me more then death. In
like maner I was wont to ſolace
my ſelfe in Fiſhyng, Hunting,
ſhootyng in the Hackbut:
And nowe I mynde no nother
but to bewaile and lament the
tyme I haue loſte: and call
to minde the firſt tyme that

the Emperor toke me into his
ſeruice, frō thence where I was
noriſhed from my tendre yeres
in great feare, &amp; not knowyng
what the world was, but occupied
only in my deuocions and
lernynges: I often roſe at midnight,
I comforted the ſicke, I
red the goſpell and other good
bokes of good doctrine. Briefly,
euery mā did helpe me to be
good, and chaſtiſed me frō euil:
If I did well, I was praiſed:
if I did euil, I was corrected: if
I were heauye, I was comforted:
if I were angry, I was appeaſed
if in any agony, my frē
               des
praied to God for me: O
what cauſe haue I to repent
out of meaſure, thus to haue
forſaken reſt and godly liuyng
and to haue enioyed epiſcopall

dignitie, in which the Emperor
ſet me: foraſmuche as a verteous
life is ye hauen of all good,
and the Epiſcopal dignitie the
ſea of all daungier. Lo how I
haue paſſed my good yeres wt
               out
emploiyng my tyme wel, &amp;
wtout knowlege what my fortune
ſhould be. I do therfore
admoniſhe the reder, to do better
then I haue done in ye court,
if yu be there, or els to forſake it
in a better houre then I haue
done: for ſo doyng thou ſhalt
declare thy ſelfe, that thou haſt
determined to liue ſagely and
well aduiſed.

            Farewell worlde, foraſmuch

burieſt vs before we dye.

without fault, honor
without ſpotte, riches without

            Farewell worlde, foraſmuch
as in thy palaice promiſes are
made &amp; neuer kepte, men ſerue
and haue no rewarde, they are
inuited to be deceiued, they labour

to be troubled, &amp; trauail
to take paine, they laugh and
are beaten, thou faineſt to ſtay

to pull away ſtrait again, thou
honoreſt vs, to defame vs, and
correcteſt without mercy.
            Farewell worlde, thou flaū

them that are in credite,
and doeſt auaūce the infamed,
thou letteſt ye traitors paſſe fre,
and putteſt true menne to their

thou robbeſt the poore
&amp; geueſt to the riche, deliuereſt

innocētes, gueſt licence to departe

part do what they lyſt, but not
what they ſhould.
            
               
Farewell worlde, foraſmuche
as in thy palaice no manne is
called by his right name, for
why? they call the raſhe valiaunt:
the proude, colde harted:
the importune, diligēt: the ſad,
peaceable: the ꝓdigal, magnifical:
the couetous a good huſband:
the babler, eloquent: the
ignoraunt, a litle ſpeaker: the
wāton, amorous: the quiet mā,
a foole: the forbearer, a courtier:
the tyraunt, noble. And
thus thou worlde, calleſt the
counterfeat, the true ſubſtaūce,
and the trueth, the counterfeat.
            Farwel worlde, for thou deceiueſt
all that be in thee: promiſyng
to the ambicious, honors:
to the gredy, to come forwarde:
to the brokers, offices:
to the couetous, riches: to the

gluttons, bākettes: to the enemies
vengeance: to the thefes,
ſecretnes: to the vicious, reſt: to
the yong, tyme: and to al thing
that is falſe, aſſuraunce.
            Farewell worlde, for in thy
houſe fidelitie is neuer kepte,
nor truth maintained: and alſo
we may ſee in thy houſe, one
glad, and another afrayd: ſome
ouercharged: ſome out of the
right way: ſome voyde of comfort,
deſperate, ſad, heauy, ouerburdened
and charged, &amp; more
then loſt, and ſometyme bothe.
            Farewell worlde, foraſmuch
as in thy cōpany, he that wenes
himſelfe moſte aſſured, is moſt
vncertain, and he that folowes
thee, goeth out of the way: and
he yt ſerues thee, is euil payed:
and he that loues thee, is euil

entreated: &amp; he that contentes
thee, contenteth an euil maſter:
and he that haunteth thee, is abuſed.
            Farewell worlde, foraſmuch
as thou haſt ſuche miſhap, that
ſeruices done and preſentes offered
to thee, profite nothyng,
nor the lyes that is tolde thee,
nor the bākettes made to thee:
nor the faythfulnes we geue to
thee: nor the loue we beare to
thee.
            Farewell worlde, foraſmuch
as thou deceiueſt al, backbiteſt
all, &amp; ſlaūdereſt al, chaſticeſt al,
thretteſt vs al: achiueſt all, and
in the ende forgetteſt all.
            Farewell worlde, ſithens in
thy company al men complain,
all crye out, all wepe, &amp; all men
dye liuyng.
            
               
Farewell worlde, ſythens by
thee we hate eche one the other
to the death: To ſpeake till we
lye: to loue, till we diſpaire: to
eate, till we ſpue: to drinke, till
we be drōken: to vſe brokage to
tobbery: &amp; to ſynne, till we dye.
            Farewell world, for beyng in
the, we forget our infācy, &amp; our
grene age, with out experience:
our youth, in vices: our middle
age in turmoilyng &amp; buſynes:
our olde age in lamētacions, &amp;
all our tyme coūted together in
vaine hopes.
            Farewell worlde, for in thy
ſchoole we are led til ye heere be
white: the eyes blered: the eares
deaf: the noſtrels droppyng: ye
forehead wrinkled: ye fete goutie:
the raynes full of grauel: ye
ſtomacke ful of euil humours:

the head full of migrain: the
body ful of ſorow, &amp; the mynde
full of paſſions.
            Farewell worlde, for none of
thy louers come to good ꝓfite,
witneſſe thoſe that daily we ſee,
are not falſe knaues marked in
the face? theues hanged? manquellers
headed? robbers by ye
hye wayes, ſette vpon wheles?
heritikes brent? falſe money
makers boiled: killers of their
parētes, torne in pieces, &amp; other
diuers puniſhementes of ſuche
as are great in fauor wt thee?
            Farewell worlde, foraſmuch
as thy ſeruaūtes haue no more
paſtyme, but to trot by the ſtretes,
to mocke one another? to
ſeke out wenches? to ſende preſentes:
to beguile yong girles:
write amorous letters: ſpeake

to baundes: play at ye diſe: plede
againſt their neighbour: tell
newes: inuent lyes, and ſtudye
newe vices.
            Farewell worlde, for in thy
palaice none will do good to
other: for the Boare fightes againſt
the Lyon: the Vnicorne
againſt the Cocodril: the Egle
againſt ye Vultur: the Elephāt
againſt ye Mynotaure: the Sacre
gainſt the Kyte: the maſtyf,
againſt the Bull: One man againſt
another, and al together
againſt death.
            Farewell worlde, becauſe yu
haſt nothing, but to our ruine:
For often the yerth openeth afore
our feete: ye water drounes
vs: the fyer burnes vs: the ayer
miſtempers vs: the Wynter
doth kyll vs: the Sōmer doth

chafe vs, the dogges doth byte
vs: the Cattes doeth ſcrat vs:
the Serpētes doth poyſon vs:
the Flyes doeth pricke vs: the
Flees doeth eat vs: &amp; aboue al,
worldely buſines deuours vs:
            Farewell worlde, ſeyng no
man can paſſe thy dominion in
ſuertie, for in euery pathe we
fynde ſtoones to ſtumble at:
bridges that brekes vnder vs:
Snowe that letteth vs: Moū
               taines
that werye vs: Thunders
that feares vs: Theues
that robbe vs: Encoūters that
hurtes vs, &amp; euil fortune that
killes vs.
            Farewell worlde, foraſmuch
as in thy countrey there is litle
health: for ſome be lippers, and
ſome haue the French pockes:
ſome the Canker, and ſome the

goute: and ſome haue the foule
euil, and ſome the Sciatica, and
ſome the ſtone, and ſome Quotidian
feuers: ſome wanderyng
feuers, ſome tercian &amp; quarten
feuers: ſpaſmes, paulſies, &amp; the
moſte parte ſicke offaire folly.
            Farewel worlde, foraſmuche
as there is not a manne in thy
houſe but he is noted with ſome
defaute in his perſon: For if
there be any talle man, the reſt
is lubberlike. If he haue a
fayre face, his iye ſhall be too
blacke: If he haue a good forehed,
it ſhalbe wrinkeled: If he
haue a welfauored mouthe, he
ſhall lacke teethe: If he haue
faire hādes, he ſhal lacke faire
heer, And if he haue faire heer,
he ſhall haue a foule ſkynne.
            Farewel worlde, foraſmuch

as the inhabitaūtes in thee are
ſo variable to maners and cō
               dicions,
that ſome will folowe
the court, ſome wil ſayle on the
ſea: and if one would be a marchaunt,
the other will be a huſbandman:
If the one will be a
hūter, the other will be a fiſher:
If one wil gouerne a Monarchy,
ye other vnder pretēce of yt,
will pyll &amp; poll ye poore people.
            Farewell worlde, for aſmuche
as in thy houſe there are none
that prepare themſelfes to liue,
and muche leſſe to dye: And yet
we ſee ſome die yong, and ſome
in middle age, ſome in old age,
ſome dye by hāgyng, and ſome
by drounyng: ſome dye for hū
               ger,
&amp; ſome in eatyng, ſlepyng,
and reſtyng, and ſome or they
beware, and for the moſt parte

or they loke for death.
            Farewell worlde, foraſmuch
as we can neither knowe thy
diſpoſicion nor condicion: For
if one be wiſe, another is a fole:
If one be fyne, another is of a
groſſe witte: If one be valiant,
another is a coward: If one be
geuen to peace, another is ſedicious:
And if one be of a gentle
ſpirit, another is very froward.
            Farewell worlde, ſeyng noman
can liue with thee: for if a
man eate to lytle, he becommes
weake: if to muche, he waxeth
ſicke: if a man labour, ſtraite
he is wery: if he be idle, he liueth
beſtly: if he geue litle, he is
called a nigarde: if he geue
muche, he is called prodigal: if
a mā viſite his frēdes often, he
is called importune: if to ſeldome,

full of diſdaine: If a mā
ſuffre wrong, he is called falſe
hearted: And if he do reuenge
then is he wilfull: If he haue
frendes, he is praiſed: If enemies,
he is purſued: if one tary
to long in a place, he waxeth
wery: and if he chaunge to oft,
he is grudged at. Finally, I
ſay, that ſuche thynges as diſpleaſe
me, I am forced to folowe,
and that which I would,
I cannot come by.
            O worlde vncleane, I coniure
thee thou filthy worlde, I
pray O thou worlde, &amp; proteſt
againſt thee thou worlde, that
thou neuer haue part in me, for
I demaūde nor deſire nothyng
that is in thee, neither hope of
any thyng in thee, for I haue
determinined with my ſelf that

               poſui finem curis, ſpes, et fortuna
valete. I haue finiſhed
worldly cares, therfore
hope and fortune
farewell.
         
         FINIS.
