            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            TO
THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE,
AND
truly religious, my ſingular
good Lord, Edward Earle
of Norwich.
            
               My ever honoured Lord:
            
            
               I Confeſſe my
charity led me
into an error;
Your Lordſhippe
well
knowes how
apt I am to be
overtaken with theſe better deceits
of an over kinde credulitie. I

had thought that any daſh of my
pen, in a ſudden, and eaſie advertiſement,
might have ſerved to
have quitted that ignorant ſcandall,
which was caſt upon my
miſ-taken aſſertion, of the true viſibility
of the Romane Church.
The iſſue proves all otherwiſe:
I finde, to my griefe, that the miſunderſtanding
tenacitie of ſome
zealous ſpirits hath made it a
quarrell. It cannot but trouble
me to ſee that the poſition, which
is ſo familiarly current with the
beſt reformed Divines; &amp; which
hath beene ſo oft and long ſince
publiſhed by mee without contradiction;
yea, not without the
approbation and applauſe of the
whole repreſentative body of the
Clergie of this kingdome, ſhould

now be quarrelled, and drawne
into the deteſtation of thoſe that
know it not; As one therefore
that ſhould thinke it coroſive
enough, that any occaſion ſhould
be taken by ought of mine, to ravell
but one thred of that ſeamleſs
coat, I doe earneſtly deſire, by a
more full explication, to give
cleare ſatisfaction to all Readers;
and by this ſeaſonable reconcilement,
to ſtop the flood-gates of
contention; I know it will not be
unpleaſing to your Lordſhip, that
through your honourable and pious
hands, theſe welcome papers
ſhould be tranſmitted to many;
Wherein I ſhall firſt beſeech, yea
adjure al Chriſtians, under whoſe
eies they ſhall fall, by the dreadfull
name of that GOD, who ſhall

judge both the quicke, and the
dead, to lay aſide all unjuſt prejudices;
and to allow the words of
Truth, and Peace; I dare confidently
ſay, Let us be underſtood,
and we are agreed.
            The ſearcher of all harts knows
how far it was from my thoughts
to ſpeak ought in favour of the
Roman Synagogue: If I have not
ſufficiently branded that Strūpet, I
juſtly ſuffer. Luthers broad word is
by me already both ſafely cōſtrued,Ob.
&amp; ſufficiently vindicated. But,
doe you not ſay, It is a true viſible
Church? Doe you not yeeld ſome
kinde of communion with theſe
clients of Antichriſt? What is, if
this be not, favour? Marke well,
Chriſtian Reader, and the Lord
give thee underſtanding in all

things:Reſp. To beginne with the
latter; No man can ſay but the
Church of Rome holds ſome
Truths; thoſe truths are Gods,
and in his right, ours, why ſhould
not wee challenge our owne,
whereſoever we finde it? If a verie
Devill ſhall ſay of Chriſt, Thou
art the Sonne of the living God, wee
will ſnatch this truth out of his
mouth, as uſurped; and in ſpight
of him, proclaime it for our own.
Indeed; there is no communion
betwixt light and darkneſſe, but
there is communion betwixt
light and light; Now all truth is
light, and therefore ſymbolizeth
with it ſelfe. With that light,
therefore, whoſe glimmering yet
remaines in their darkneſſe, our
clearer light will, and muſt hold

communion; If they profeſſe
three Perſons in one Godhead;
two natures in one perſon of
Chriſt; ſhall we detrect to joine
with them in this Chriſtian veritie?
We abhorre to have any communion
with them in their errors,
in their idolatrous or ſuperſtitious
practices, theſe are their
owne, not ours. If we durſt have
taken their part in theſe, this
breach had not beene; Now who
can but ſay that wee muſt hate
their evill, and allow their good?
It is no countenance to their errors
that we imbrace our owne truths;
It is no diſparagement to our
truths, that they have blended
them with their errors: Here can
be no difference, then, if this communion
bee not miſ-taken; no

man will ſay that we may ſever
from their common truths; No
man will ſay that we may joyne
with them in their hatefull errours.
            For the former; Hee that ſaith
a theefe is truly a man, doth hee
therein fauour that theefe? He that
ſaith, a diſeaſed, dropſied, dying
bodie, is a true (though corrupt)
body, doth he favour that diſeaſe,
or that living carcaſſe? It is no other,
no more that I ſay of the
Church of Rome: Trueneſſe of
being, and outward viſibility, are
no praiſe to her; Yea, theſe are aggravations
to her falſhood: The
advantage that is both ſought and
found in this aſſertion is onely
ours; as we ſhall ſee in the ſequell,
without any danger of their gain.

I ſay, then, that ſhe is a true church,
but, I ſay withall, ſhee is a falſe
Church: True in exiſtence, but
falſe in beleefe: Let not the homonymie
of a word breed jarres,
where the ſenſe is accorded: If
we doe not yeeld her the true being
of a Church, why do we call
her the Church of Rome? What
ſpeake we of? or where is the ſubject
of our queſtion? who ſees
not that there is a morall trueneſs,
and a naturall? He that is morally
the falſeſt man, is, in nature, as
truly a man, as the honeſteſt; and
therefore in this regard as true a
man: In the ſame ſenſe therefore
that wee ſay the Devill is a true
(though falſe) ſpirit; that a cheater
it a true (though falſe) man, wee
may &amp; muſt ſay, that the Church

of Rome is a true (though falſe)
Church; Certainely, there hath
beene a true errour, and miſ-taking
of the ſenſe that is guiltie of
this quarrell. As for the viſibility,
there can be no queſtion: Would
God, that Church did not too
much fill our eie, yea the world;
There is nothing wherein it doth
more pride it ſelfe, than in a glorious
conſpicuitie, ſcorning, in
this regard, the obſcure paucitie
of their oppoſers.
            But you ſay,Ob. What is this but
to play with ambiguities; That
the Church of Rome is it ſelfe,
that is, a Church; that it is viſible;
that it is truly exiſtent, there can
be no doubt; but is it ſtill a part
of the truly exiſtent, viſible church
of Chriſt?Reſp. Surely, no otherwiſe

than an hereticall and Apoſtaticall
Church is, and may be: Reader,
whoſoever thou art, for Gods
ſake, for thy ſoules ſake, marke
where thou treadeſt; Elſe thou
ſhalt bee ſure to fall either into an
open gulfe of uncharitableneſſe,
or into a dangerous precipice of
errour. There is no feare, nor favour
to ſay, that the Church of
Rome, under a Chriſtian face,
hath an Antichriſtian heart; overturning
that foundation by neceſſarie
inferences, which by open
profeſſion in avoweth: That face,
that profeſſion, thoſe avowed
principles are enough to give it
claime to a true outward viſibilitie
of a Chriſtian Church; whiles
thoſe damnable inferences are enough
to feoffe it in the true ſtyle

of hereſie, and Antichriſtianiſme;
Now, this hereſie, this Antichriſtianiſme
makes Rome juſtly odious,
and execrable to God, to Angels,
and Men; but cannot utterly
diſchurch it, whiles thoſe main
principles maintaine a weake life
in that crazie, and corrupted
bodie.
            But is not this language different
from that whereto our eares
and eies have beene inured, from
the mouthes, and pens of ſome
reverend Divines and profeſſors
of our Church? Know, Reader,
that the ſtreame of the famous
Doctors, both at home, and abroad,
hath runne ſtrongly my
way: I ſhould have feared, and
hated to goe alone; what reaſon
is there then to ſingle out one man

in a throng? Some few worthie
Authors have ſpoken otherwiſe,
in the warmth of their zealous
contention; yet ſo, as that even to
them durſt I appeale for my Iudges;
for if their ſound differ from
me, their ſenſe agrees with me:
that, which as I touched in my
Advertiſement, ſo I am now readie
to make cleare by the inſtance
of learned Zanchius; whoſe pregnant
teſtimonies compared together,
ſhall plainly teach us, how
eaſie a reconcilement may bee
made betwixt theſe two, ſeemingly-contrarie,
opinions: That worthie
Author, in his profeſſion of
Chriſtian Religion, which hee
wrote, and publiſhed, in the 70.
yeare of his age, having defined
the Church of Chriſt in generall,

and paſſed thorow the properties
of it, at laſt, deſcending to the ſubdiviſion
of the Church militant,
comes to inquire, how particular
Churches may be knowne to be
the true churches of Chriſt, wherof
he determines thus. Illas igitur,
&amp;c. Thoſe Churches therefore
doe wee acknowledge for the
true Churches of Chriſt; in which
firſt of all, the pure doctrine of the
Goſpell is preached, heard, admitted;
and ſo onely admitted, that
there is neither place, nor eare given
to the contrarie: For both
theſe are the juſt propertie of the
flocke or ſheepe of Chriſt; namely,
both to heare the voice of their
owne Paſtor, and to reject the
voice of ſtrangers. Iohn 10. 4. In
which, ſecondly, the Sacraments

inſtituted by Chriſt, are lawfully,
and (as much as may bee) according
to Chriſts inſtitution, adminiſtred,
and received; and therefore,
in which the Sacraments
deviſed by men are not admitted,
and allowed; In which laſtly, the
diſcipline of Chriſt hath the due
place; that is, where both publiquely,
and privately, charitable
care is had, both by admonitions,
corrections, and at laſt (if need be)
by excommunications, that the
Commandements of God be duly
kept, and that all perſons live
ſoberly, iuſtly, and piouſly, to the
glory of God, and edification of
their neighbour. Thus hee;
wherein, who ſees not how directly
he aymes, both at the juſtifying
of our Churches, and the

caſheering of the Roman, which
is palpably guiltie of the violation
of theſe wholſome rules? And indeed,
it muſt needes be ſaid, if we
bring the Roman Church to this
touch, ſhe is caſt for a meer counterfeit;
ſhee is as farre from truth,
as truth is from falſhood: Now
by this time you goe away with
an opinion that learned Zanchie
is my profeſſed adverſarie, and
hath directly condemned my poſition,
of the trueneſſe, and viſibilitie
of the Roman Church: Have
but patience, I beſeech you, to read
what the ſame excellent Author
writes, in his golden Preface to
that noble worke, De natura Dei;
where this queſtion is clearly, &amp;
punctuall decided: There you
ſhall finde, that having paſſed

through the wofull and gloomie
offuſcations of the Church of
God, in all former ages, he, deſcending
to the darkneſſe of the preſent
Babylon; concludes thus:
Deinde non potuit Satan, &amp;c. Moreover,
Satan could not, in the verie
Roman Church, doe what he liſted,
as hee had done in the Eaſterne;
to bring all things to ſuch
paſſe, as that it ſhould no more
have the forme of a Chriſtian
Church; For, in ſpight of Satan,
that Church retained ſtill the chief
foundations of the faith, although
weakned with the doctrines of
men; it retained the publique preaching
of the word of God, thogh
in many places miſ-underſtood,
and miſ-conſtrued; the invocation
of the name of Chriſt, though

joyned alſo with the invocation
of dead men; the adminiſtration
of Baptiſme, inſtituted by Chriſt
himſelfe, howſoever defiled with
the addition of many ſuperſtitions.
So as, together with the ſymbole
of the covenant, the Covenant
it ſelfe remained ſtill in her;
I meane in all the Churches of the
Weſt, no otherwiſe than it did in
the Church of Iſrael, even after
that all things were in part profaned
by Ieroboam, and other impious,
and Idolatrous Kings, upon
the defection made by them from
the Church, and Tribe of Iuda;
For, neither doe I aſſent to them
which would have the Church
of Rome to have no leſſe ceaſed
to be the Church of Chriſt, than
thoſe Eaſterne Churches, which

afterwards turned Mahumetan;
what Church was ever more
corrupt than the Church of the
ten Tribes, yet we learne from the
Scriptures, that it was ſtill the
Church of God? And how doth
S. Paul call that Church, wherein
Antichriſt (hee ſaith) ſhall ſit,
the Temple of God? neither is it
any Baptiſme at all, that is adminiſtred
out of the Church of Chriſt.
The wife that is an Adultereſſe,
doth not ceaſe to be a wife, unleſſe
being deſpoiled of her mariage-ring,
ſhe be manifeſtly divorced:
The Church of Rome, therefore,
is yet the Church of Chriſt; but
what manner of Church? Surely
ſo corrupted and depraved, and
with ſo great tyrannie oppreſſed,
that you can neither, with a good

conſcience, partake with them, in
their holy things, nor ſafely dwell
amongſt them. Thus he againe;
Wherein you ſee hee ſpeakes as
home for me, as I could deviſe to
ſpeake for my ſelfe: and as appoſitely
profeſſeth to oppoſe the
contrarie.
            Looke, now how this learned
Author may be reconciled to his
owne pen; and by the very ſame
way, ſhall my pen bee reconciled
with others: Either he agrees not
with himſelfe, or elſe, in his ſenſe,
I agree with my gainſayers: Nothing
is more plaine, then that hee
in that former ſpeech, and all other
claſſicke Authors, that ſpeake
in that Key, meane, by a True
Church, a ſound, pure, right beleeving
Church; ſo as their vera is

rather verax:
               Ibid. praefat. de nat. Dei. 
               Zanchie explicates
the terme, whiles he joines veram
&amp; puram together; ſo as in this
conſtruction it is no true Church
that is an unſound one; as if truth
of exiſtence were all one with
truth of doctrine: In this ſenſe,
whoſoever ſhall ſay the Church
of Rome is a true Church, I ſay he
calls evill good, and is no better
than a teacher of lyes. But, if we
meaſure the true being of a viſible
Church, by the direct maintenance
of fundamentall principles,
though by conſequences indirectly
overturned, and by the poſſeſſion
of the word of God, and his
Sacraments, though not without
ſoule adulteration; what judicious
Chriſtian can but, with mee,
ſubſcribe to learned Zanchius, that

the Church of Rome hath yet the
true viſibilitie of a Church of
Chriſt: what ſhould I need to
preſs the latitude, and multiplicity
of ſenſe of the word, Church;
there is no one term that I know,
in all uſe of ſpeech, ſo various; If,
in a large ſenſe, it be taken to comprehend
the ſociety of all that profeſſe
Chriſtian Religion, through
the whole world, howſoever impured,
who can denie this title to
the Roman? If, in a ſtrict ſenſe, it
be taken (as it is by Zanchius here,
and all thoſe Divines who refuſe
to give this ſtyle to the Synagogue
of Rome) for the companie of elect
faithfull men gathered into
one myſticall bodie under one
head, Chriſt, waſhed by his blood;
juſtified by his merits, ſanctified

by his Spirit, conſcionablie waiting
upon the true ordinances of
God, in his pure Word, and holie
Sacramēts▪ who can be ſo ſhameleſſe,
as to give this title to the Roman
Church? Both theſe ſentences,
then, are equally true; The
Church of Rome is yet a true Church
in the firſt ſenſe; The Church of Rome
long ſince ceaſed to bee a true Church
in the ſecond. As thoſe friendly ſouldiers
therefore, of old, ſaid to their
fellowes (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ?) why fight
we? Stay, ſtay, deare brethren, for
Gods ſake, for his Churches ſake,
for your ſoules ſake, ſtay theſe buſie
and unprofitable litigations;
put up, on both ſides, your angrie
pens; Turne your Swords into
Sithes, to cut downe the ranke
corruptiōs of the Roman church;

and your Speares into Mattockes,
to beat downe the walls of this
myſticall Babylon; There are enemies

                  •
               now abroad, Let us bee
friends at home; But if your ſenſe
be the ſame, you will aske, why
our termes varie, and why wee
have choſen to fall upon that maner
of expreſſion, which gives aduantage
to the Adverſarie, offence
to our owne? Chriſtian Reader,
let me beſeech thee, in the bowels
of Chriſt, to weigh well this matter,
and then tell me why ſuch offence,
ſuch advantage ſhould bee
rather given by my words, than
by the ſame words, in the mouth
of Luther, of Calvin, of Zanchie, Iunius,
Pleſſee, Hooker, Andrewes,
Field, Crakenthorpe, Bedel, and that
whole cloud of learned and pious

Authors, who have, without
exceptiō, uſed the ſame language?
And why more by my words,
now, than twentie yeares agoe, at
which time I publiſhed the ſame
truth, in a more ful and liberall expreſſion.
Wiſe and charitable
Chriſtians may not be apt to take
offence where none is given. As
for anie Advantage that is hereby
given to the Adverſaries, they
may put it in their eye, and ſee never
the worſe. Loe; ſay they,
we are of the true viſible Church;
this is enough for us; why are we
forſaken, why are we preſecuted,
why are we ſolicited to change?
Alas, poore ſoules, doe they not
know, that Hypocrites, leud perſons,
reprobates, are no leſſe members
of the true viſible Church?

what gaine they by this but a deeper
damnation? To what purpoſe
did the Iewes crie, The Temple
of the Lord, whiles they deſpighted
the Lord of that Temple? Is
the ſea-weed ever the leſſe vile, becauſe
it is dragd vp together with
good fiſh? They are of the viſible
Church, ſuch as it is; what is this
but to ſay, they are neither Iewes,
nor Turkes, nor Pagans; but miſbeleevers,
damnablie hereticall in
opinion, ſhamefullie idolatrous
in practice; Let them make their
beſt of this juſt Elogie; and triumph
in this ſtyle, may we never
proſper if we envie them this glorie:
Our care ſhall be, that, beſides
the Church ſenſible,Epiſt. l. 2. reſp. ad Catabaptiſt. (as Zuinglius
diſtinguiſheth) we may be of the
Church ſpirituall; and not reſting

in a fruitleſſe viſibilitie, wee may
finde our ſelves livelie limbes of
the myſtical body of Chriſt; which
onelie condition ſhall give us a
true right to heaven; whiles faſhionable
profeſſion, in vaine
cries, Lord, Lord, and is barred out
of thoſe bleſſed gates, with an, I
know you not.
            
            Neither may the Reader think,
that I affect to goe by-waies of
ſpeech: no, I had not taken this
path, unleſſe I had found it both
more beaten, and fairer: I am not
ſo unwiſe, to teach the Adverſarie
what diſadvantage I conceive to
be given to our moſt juſt cauſe, by
the other manner of explication.
Let it ſuffice to ſay, that this form
of defence more fully ſtops the adverſaries
mouth in thoſe two

maine and envious ſcandals,
which hee caſts upon our holy
Religion, Defection from the
Church, and Innovation; than
which, no ſuggeſtion hath wont
to bee more prevalent with
weake, and ungrounded hearts,
what wee further win by this,
not more charitable, than ſafe
Tenet, I had rather it ſhould bee
ſilently conceived by the judicious,
then blazoned by my
free penne; ſhortly, in this ſtate
of the queſtion, our gaine is as
cleare, as the Adverſaries loſſe:
our ancient Truth triumphes
over their upſtart errours, our
charitie over their mercileſſe preſumptions;
Feare not therefore,
deare brethren, where there is
on roome for danger; Suſpect

not fraud where there is nothing
but plaine, honeſt, ſimplicitie of
intentions; cenſure not where
there is the ſame Truth, clad in a
different, but more eaſie habite
of words; But if any mans fervent
zeale ſhall rather draw him to the
liking of that other, rougher, and
harder way, ſo as in the meane
time he keepe within the bounds
of Chriſtian charitie, I taxe him
not; let everie man abound in
his owne ſenſe; Onely let our
hearts, and tongues, and hands,
conſpire together in peace with
our ſelves, in warre with our
common enemies.
            Thus farre have I (Right Honourable)
in a deſire of peace,
poured out my ſelfe into a plaine
explication, and eaſie accordance:

Thoſe whom I ſtrive to ſatisfie,
are onely miſ-takers; whoſe cenſures,
if ſome man would have
either laught out, or deſpiſed, yet
I have condeſcended to take off
by a ſerious deprecation, and
juſt defence.
            It is an vnreaſonable motion
to requeſt mindes prepoſſeſſed
with prejudice to heare reaſon;
Whole Volumes are nothing to
ſuch as have contented themſelves
onely to take up opinions
upon truſt, and will hold them,
becauſe they know where they
had them: In vaine ſhould I ſpend
my ſelfe in beating upon ſuch anviles;
but for thoſe ingenuous
Chriſtians, which will hold an
eare open for juſtice, and truth, I
have ſaid enough, if ought at all
needed.
            
               
Alas, my Lord, I ſee and grieve
to ſee it; it is my Rochet that hath
offended, and not I; In another
habit, I, long ſince, publiſhed this,
and more, without diſlike; It is
this colour of innocence that hath
bleared ſome over-tender eyes;
Wherein I know not whether I
ſhould more pittie their errour,
or applaud my owne ſufferings;
although I may not ſay with the
Pſalmiſt, What hath the righteous
done? Let mee (I beſeech your
Lordſhip) upon this occaſion,
have leave to give a little vent to
my juſt griefe in this point.
            The other day I fell upon a
Latine Pamphlet, homely for
ſtyle, tedious for length, zealouſly
uncharitable for ſtuffe, wherein
the Author (onely wiſe in this,

that he would bee unknowne)
in a grave fierceneſſe flies in the
face of our Engliſh Prelacie; not
ſo much enveighing againſt their
Perſons, (which he could be content
to reverence) as their verie
places. I bleſt my ſelfe to ſee the
caſe ſo altered: Heretofore, the
Perſon had wont to beare off
manie blowes from the function;
now the verie function wounds
the perſon: In what caſe are we,
when that which ſhould command
reſpect, brands us? What
blacke Art hath raiſed up this
ſpirit of Aerius from his pit? Wo
is mee, that zeale ſhould breed
ſuch monſters of conceit: It is
the honour, the Pompe, the
wealthe, the pleaſure (hee ſaith) of
the Epiſcopall Chaire that is guiltie

of the depravation of our Calling;
and if himſelfe were ſo overlayd
with greatneſſe, hee ſhould
ſuſpect his owne fidelitie. Alas,
poore man, at what diſtance doth
hee ſee us? Foggie Ayre uſeth to
repreſent everie object farre bigger
than it is. Our Sauiour in his
temptation upon the Mount,
had onely the glorie of thoſe
Kingdomes ſhowed to him, by
that ſubtile Spirit, not the cares,
and vexations; Right ſo are our
dignities exhibited to theſe envious
beholders; Little doe theſe
men ſee the toyles, and anxieties
that attend this ſuppoſedly-pleaſing
eminence.
            All the revenge that I would
wiſh to this uncharitable Cenſurer,
ſhould bee this, that hee

might bee but for a while adjudged
to this ſo glorious ſeate of
mine; that ſo his experience might
taſte the bewitching pleaſures of
this envied greatneſſe; hee ſhould
well finde more danger of being
over-ſpent with worke, than of
languiſhing with eaſe &amp; delicacie.
            For mee I need not appeale to
Heaven: Eyes enow can witneſſe
how few free houres I have enjoyed,
ſince I put on theſe Robes
of ſacred honour. In ſo much as
I could finde in my heart, with
holy Gregorie, to complaine of my
change; were it not, that I ſee theſe
publique troubles are ſo many
acceptable ſervices to my God,
whoſe glorie is the end of my
being: Certainly, my Lord, if
none but earthly reſpects ſhould

ſway me, I ſhould heartily wiſh
to change this Pallace (which the
Providence of God, and the
bountie of my gracious Soveraigne
hath put mee into) for my
quiet Cell at Waltham, where I
had ſo ſweet leaſure to enjoy
God, your Lordſhip, and my ſelfe:
But I have followed the calling of
my God, to whoſe ſervice I am
willingly ſacrificed; and muſt
now, in an holy obedience to his
Divine Majeſtie, with what
cheerefulneſſe I may, ride out all
the ſtormes of envie, which unavoidably
will alight vpon the
leaſt appearance of a conceived
greatneſſe; in the meane time,
what ever I may ſeeme to others,
I was never leſſe in my owne apprehenſions;
and, were it not for

this attendance of envie, could
not yeeld my ſelfe any whit greater
than I was; what ever I am,
that good God of mine, make
mee faithfull to him; and compoſe
the unquiet ſpirits of men, to
a conſcionable care of the publique
peace; with which prayer,
together with the apprecation of
all happineſſe to your Lordſhip,
and all yours, I take leave and am
            
               Your Lordſhips truly devoted
in all hearty
obſervance and
dutie,
IOS. EXON.
            
         
         
            
            
            TO THE CHRISTIAN
READER
Wiſedome and
Charitie.
            
               IT is no eaſie matter
for a man ſo far
to mortifie his ſelf-love,
as to neglect
himſelfe for the publique good;
&amp; to vaile his private ingagements
(though with ſome ſeeming
diſadvantage) to the
peace of the Church; that which

is too apparent in the preſent
occaſion. Whiles there might be
ſome colour of ambiguitie of
termes, and poſsibilitie of miſconſtruction,
in that Poſition
concerning the true being, and
viſibility of the Roman church;
I could the leſſe marvell that
a miſtaking ſhould breed a
quarrell; but now, after ſo clear
an explication, as I have given
of my ſenſe, and ſo ſatisfactory
a reconcilement, as no ingenuous
Chriſtian can except againſt;
I am not a little troubled
to ſee the peace of the
church yet diſquieted with perſonall,

and unkinde diſſertations.
            Surely (what ever may bee
pretended) not one haire of any
Chriſtians head can be indangered,
in that aſſertion of
mine (yet not ſo much mine, as
the moſt of the reformed Divines
of Chriſtendome) as
it is by them, and me both underſtood,
and interpreted; ſince
we call all Chriſtians to no leſſe
deteſtation of the abhominable
corruptiōs, &amp; Idolatries of the
Roman Church, notwithſtanding
the yeeldance of a bootleſſe
viſibilitie, then thoſe that

deny it the being, and name of
a Church: yea wee raiſe more
ſtrong advantage againſt the
adverſary by this grant, then
by that denyall.
            Neyther is here the leaſt
contradiction to any clauſe of
the Articles of our Church, of
England, in that ſenſe wherein
I have delivered my ſelfe;
ſuch is my true filiall honor to
that our holy Mother, that I
ſhould hate my ſelfe, if I ſhould
offer to oppoſe any of her ſacred
dictates; how ever it may
ſound to an ignorant eare.
            In every oppoſition there

muſt be ſuppoſed the ſame ſubject,
the ſame reſpect, the ſame
underſtanding of both; Elſe
how ever the words run, the
matter diſagrees not. For example;
If one man ſhall ſay,
The Church is viſible, materiall,
conſiſting of lime and
ſtone; Another ſhall ſay, The
Church is inviſible, immateall,
not conſiſting of any earthly
ſtuffe; theſe two doe not contradict
each other; whiles the
one ſpeakes of the outward fabricke
of the Church; the other
of the ſpirituall ſtate of
the Church; Neyther is it

otherwiſe in my aſſertion, and
that which is counter-alledged
from the Articles or Homilies
of the Church; as I have
ſufficiently explained my ſenſe
both in my Advertiſement,
and Reconciler; It is not for
me to cloy my Reader with repetitions.
            Now, leſt I might perhaps
ſeeme partiall to my own cauſe;
and flatter my ſelfe in my own
opinion; I have craved the
judgement of ſome, of the moſt
eminent &amp; approved Divines
of our Church, &amp; the French;
whoſe names are juſtly reverend;

whoſe workes have made
thē famous in our gates: I have
of many hundreds, ſelected only
foure;B. Morton of Cov. and Lichfield. B. Dauenan

                two Biſhops, and two
Doctors; ſuch, as whoſe very
mētion is able to ſtop the mouth
of calumny; and to make ignorance
aſhamed of it ſelfe. I
have taken the boldnes to publiſh
their private Letters in
anſwer to mine. Peruſe them,
Reader, and take ſatisfaction;
and confeſſe it was thy miſtaking,
and not my errour that
made me appeare foule: Farewell,
and love peace, and the
God of peace be with thee.

            To the Right Reuerend
Father in God, THOMAS,
Lord Biſhop of Couentree
and Lichfield.
            
               MY Lord; may your
leaſure ſerue
you to read ouer
this poore ſheete of Paper,
and to cenſure it: Your
name is left out in the Catalogue
of ſome other famous
Diuines, mentioned in the
body of it, that you might
not be forestalled. I ſuffer

for that wherein your ſelfe,
amongst many renowmed
Orthodoxe Doctors of the
Church, are my partner; As
if you had not already ſaid
it enough; I beſeech your
Lordſhip ſay, once more,
what you thinke of the true
being, and viſibilitie of the
Romane Church, Your excellent
and zealous writings
haue iuſtly won you a
conſtant reputation of great
learning, and no leſſe ſinceritie,
and haue placed you
out of the reach of ſuſpicion;
No man can, no man

dare miſ-doubt your deciſion;
If you find any one
word amiſſe in this explication,
ſpare me not; I ſhall
gladly kiſſe your rod; and
hold your vtmost ſeueritie a
fauour; But if you here
meete with no other then
the words of a commonly
profeſſed truth; acquit me
ſo farre as to ſay, there is no
reaſon I ſhould ſuffer alone;
And let the wilfull, or ignorant
miſ-takers know that
they wound innocencie, and,
through my ſids, ſtrike their
best friends. I ſhould not

herein deſire you to tender
my fame, if the iniurie done
to my name did not reflect
vpon my holy ſtation, vpon
my wel-meant labours, vpon
almost all the famous,
and wel-deſeruing Authors
that haue ſtood for the truth
of God; and laſtly if I did
not ſee this miſ-taken quarrell
to threaten much preiudice
to the Church of God;
whoſe Peace is no leſſe
deare to vs both, then our
liues; In earneſt deſire, and
hope of ſome few ſatisfactorie
lines from your Reuerend

hand, in anſwere to
this, my bold, yet iuſt,
ſuit, I take leaue,
and am
            
               Your much deuoted
and louing
Brother,
IOS. EXON.
            
         
         
            
            To the Right Reuerend
Father in God, my verie good
Lord and Brother IOSEPH
Lord Biſhop of Exon,
theſe.
            
               RIght Reuerend,
and as dearely
beloued Brother,
I haue (I confeſſe)
beene too long in your
Lordſhips debt for theſe
Letters; which are now
to Apologize for me, that
although I had my payment

ready, and in numeratis
at the firſt reading of
your Reconciler, yet I
reſerued my Anſwere
vntill I had peruſed the
two other Bookes and
ſeconds, that ſo I might
returne my payment cum
faenore.
            
            In that your Lordſhips
Tractate, I could
not but obſerue the liuely
Image of your ſelfe;
that 
                  •
               s (according to the
generall interpretation of
all ſound profeſſors of the
Goſpell of Chriſt) of a

moſt Orthodoxe Diuine;
And now remembring
the Accordance your
Lordſhip hath with others
touching the Argument
of your Booke, I
muſt needes reflect vpon
my ſelfe; who haue long
ſince defended the ſame
point, in the defence of
many others. I do therefore
much blame the Petulcitie
of whatſoeuer author
that ſhould dare to
impute a Popiſh affection
to him, whome (beſides
his excellent writings

and Sermons) Gods
viſible, eminent, and reſplendent
Graces of Illumination,
zeale, pietie
&amp; eloquence haue made
truely Honourable and
glorious in the Church
of Chriſt. Let me ſay no
more, I ſuffer in your
ſuffering, not more in conſonancie
of iudgement
then in the ſympathie of
my affection. Goe on
deare Brother with your
deſerued Honor in Gods
Church with holy courage,
knowing that the

dirtie feete of an Aduerſarie,
the more they tread,
and rubbe, the more luſtre
they giue the figure
grauen in Gold. Our
Lord Ieſus preſerue
vs to the glorie of
his ſauing
grace.
            
               Your Lordſhips vnanimous
friend and
Brother,
THO. Couent. and
Lichfield.
            
         
         
            
            To the Right Reuerend
Father in God, IOHN,
Lord Biſhop of Saliſburie.
            
               MY Lord, I ſend you
this little Pamphlet
for your cenſure;
It is not credible how ſtrangely
I haue beene traduced
euerie where, for that,
which I conceiue to be the
common opinion of reformed
Diuines, yea of reaſonable
men; that is, for affirming

the true being and viſibilitie
of the Romane
Church; You ſee how clearely
I haue endeauored to explicate
this harmeleſſe poſition;
yet I perceiue ſome
tough miſ-vnderſtandings
will not bee ſatisfied; Your
Lordſhip hath with great
reputation ſpent manie
yeares in the Diuinitie-Chaire
of the famous Vniuerſitie
of Cambridge. Let
me therefore beſeech you,
whoſe Learning, and ſinceritie
is ſo throughly approued
in Gods Church, that

you would freely (how ſhortly
ſo euer) expreſſe your
ſelfe in this point; and, if
you find that I haue deuiated,
but one hayre-breadth
from the Truth, correct me;
If not, free me by your iust
ſentence: What need I intreat
you to pittie thoſe,
whoſe deſires of faithfull offices
to the Church of God
are vnthankefully repayed
with ſuſpicion, and ſclaunder;
whoſe may not this caſe
be? I had thought I had
ſufficiently in all my writings,
and in this verie laſt

Booke of mine (whence this
quarrell is picked) ſhowed
my feruent zeale for Gods
truth againſt that Antichrian
faction of Rome, and
yet I doubt not but your
owne eares can witneſſe
what I haue ſuffered. Yea
as if this calumnie were not
enough, there want not
thoſe whoſe ſecret whiſperings
caſt vpon mee the foule
aſperſions of another Sect,
whoſe name is as much hated,
as little vnderstood,
My Lord, you know I had
a place with you (though

vnworthy) in that famous
Sinod of DROT, where
(howſoeuer ſickneſſe bereaued
me of the houres of a
concluſiue ſubſcription) yet,
your Lordſhip heard me,
with equall vehemencie to
to the rest, ſwaying downe
the vnreaſonableneſſe of
that way: I am ſtill the
ſame man, and ſhall liue
and die in the ſuffrage of
that Reuerend Synod; and
doe confidently auow, that
thoſe other oppoſed opinions
cannot ſtand with the Doctrine
of the Church of England.

But if for the compoſing
of the differences at
home (which your Lordſhip
knowes to be farre different
from Netherlandiſh)
there could haue beene tendred
any ſuch faire propoſitions
of accordance, as might
bee no preiudice to Gods
truth, I ſhould haue thought
it an holy, and happie proiect,
wherein, if it be not a
fault to haue wiſhed a ſafe
peace, I am innocent. God
ſo loue me as I doe the tranquilitie
and happineſſe of
his Church; yet can I not ſo

ouer-affect it that I would
ſacrifice one dram of Truth
to it; To that good God doe
I appeale as the witneſſe of
my ſincere he art to his whole
Truth, and no leſſe then euer
zealous deteſtation of al
Poperie, &amp; Pelagianiſme.
Your Lordſhip will be pleaſed
to pardon this importunitie,
and to vouchſaue your
ſpeedy anſwere, to
            
               Your much deuoted
and faithfull Brother,
IOS. EXON.
            
         
         
            
            
               MY Lord; you deſire
my opinion concerning
an aſſertion of
yours, wherat ſome
haue taken offence. The propoſition
was this. [That the Romane
Church remaynes yet a
True Viſible Church.] The occaſion
which makes this an ill
ſounding propoſition in the
eares of Proteſtants (eſpecially
ſuch as are not throughly acquainted
with Schoole Diſtinctions)
is the vſuall acception
of the Word, True, in our
Engliſh tongue. For though

men skilled in Metaphyſickes
hold it for a maxime, Ens, Verum,
Bonum conuertuntur: yet
with vs, he which ſhall affirme,
Such an one is a True Chriſtian,
a True Gentleman, a True
Scholler, a True Souldier, or
the like; hee is conceiued not
only to adſcribe Trueneſſe of
Beeing vnto all theſe, but thoſe
Due Qualities, or Requiſite
Actions wherby they are made
commendable or Praiſe-worthy
in their ſeuerall kinds. In
this ſenſe the Roman Church is
no more a True Church in reſpect
of Chriſt, or thoſe due
Qualities, and proper Actions
which Chriſt requires; then an
arrant whore is a True and loyall
Wife vnto her Husband I

durſt vpon mine oath be one of
your Compurgators, that you
neuer intended to adorne that
Strumpet with the Title of a
True Church in this meaning.
But your owne Writings haue
ſo fully cleered you herein;
that Suſpition it ſelfe, cannot
reaoſnably ſuſpect you in this
point. I therefore can ſay no
more concerning your miſtaken
propoſition then this. If in
that treatiſe wherein it was deliuered;
the Antecedents, or
Conſequents were ſuch, as
ſerued fitly to leade the Reader
into that Senſe, which vnder
the word True, comprehendeth
only Truth of Beeing or
Exiſtencie, and not the Due
Qualities of the thing or ſubiect;

you haue beene cauſeleſly
traduced. But on the other
ſide, if that Propoſition
comes in ex abrupto, or ſtands
ſolitarie in your diſcourſe, you
cannot maruell though by taking
the word True according
to the more ordinarie acception,
your true meaning was
miſtaken. In briefe, your Propoſition
admits a True ſenſe; &amp;
in that ſenſe, is by the beſt learned
in our Reformed Church,
not diſallowed. For The Beeing
of a Church does principally
ſtand vpon the Gratious Action
of God, calling men out
of Darkneſſe and Death, vnto
the Participation of ſight and
life in Chriſt Ieſus. So long as
God continues this Calling

vnto any people, though they
(as much as in them lies) Darken
this light, and corrupt the
meanes which ſhould bring
them to life and ſaluation in
Chriſt; yet where God Calls
men vnto the Participation of
life in Chriſt, by the word &amp; by
the Sacraments, there is the true
Being of a Chriſtian Church;
let men bee neuer ſo falſe in
their Expoſitions of GODS
Word, or neuer ſo vntruſtie in
mingling their owne Traditions
with Gods Ordinances.
Thus the Church of the Iewes
loſt not her Being of a Church,
when ſhee became an Idolatrous
Church. And thus vnder
the gouernment of the Scribes
and Phariſees, who voided the

Commandements of God by
their owne Traditions; there
was yet ſtanding a true Church
in which Zacharias, Elizabeth,
the Virgin Mary, and our Sauiour
himſelfe was borne, who
were mēbers of that Church,
and yet participated not in the
corruptions thereof. Thus to
grant that the Roman was, and
is a True Viſible Chriſtian
Church, (though in doctrine a
falſe, and in practice an Idolatrous
Church) is a true aſſertion,
and of greater vſe and neceſſitie
in our Controuerſie
with Papiſts about the Perpetuitie
of the Chriſtian Church,
then is vnderſtood by thoſe
who gainſay it. This in your
Reconciler is ſo wel explicated,

as if any ſhall continue in traducing
you, in regard of that
Propoſition, ſo explained, I
thinke it wil be only thoſe who
are better acquainted with
wrangling, then reaſoning,
and deeper in loue with ſtrife,
then truth: As for the aſperſion
of Arminianiſme, I can teſtifie
that in our Ioint imployment
at the Synod of Dort, you were
as farre from it, as my ſelfe. And
I know that no man can imbrace
it in the Doctrine of Predeſtination,
and Grace, but he
muſt firſt deſert the Articles agreed
vpon by the Church of
England, nor in the point of
perſeuerance, but he muſt vary
from the common Tenet, and
receiued opinion of our beſt

approued Doctors in the Engliſh
Church. I am aſſured that
you neither haue deſerted the
one, nor will vary from the other.
And therefore be no more
troubled with other mens

profeſſor of Diuinitie
in Oxford, and Rector

               WOrthy Maſter
Doctor Predeaux:
All our litle
world here, takes notice
of your worth, and eminencie;
who haue long furniſhed
the Diuinitie Chaire in
that famous Vniuerſitie,
with mutuall grace and honour.

Let me intreate you,
vpon the peruſall of this ſorie
ſheete of Paper, to impart
your ſelfe freely to me,
in your cenſure; and to expreſſe
to mee your cleare
iudgement, concerning the
true being, and viſibilitie
of the Romane Church; you
ſee in what ſence I profeſſe
to hold it; neither was any other
euer in my thoughts;
Say, I beſeech you, whether
you thinke any learned Orthodoxe
Diuine can, with
any colour of reaſon, maintaine
a contradiction herevnto;

And if you find (as I
doubt not) much neceſsitie
and vſe of this true, and
ſafe Tenet; helpe me to adde
(if you pleaſe) a further
ſupplie of Antidotes to thoſe
Popiſh ſpiders, that would
faine ſucke poyſon out of this
herbe. It was my earneſt
deſire that this ſatisfactorie
reconcilement might haue
ſtilled all tongues, and pens,
concerning this ill-rayſed
brabble: but I ſee to my
griefe, how much men care
for themſelues more, then
peace; I ſuffer, and the

Church is diſquieted; your
learning and grauitie will
be ready to contribute to a
ſeaſonable pacification; In
deſire, and exſpectation of
your ſpeedie anſwere, I
take my leaue, and
am
            
               Your very louing
friend, and fellow-labourer,
IOS. EXON.
            
         
         
            
            Right Reuerend Father
in GOD;
            
               VPon the receite
of your Reconciler,
which it
pleaſed you to ſend me, I
tooke occaſion (as my
manifolde diſtractions
would permit) to peruſe
what had beene ſaid on
both ſides, concerning
the now-being of the Romane
Church. VVherin
I muſt profeſſe, that I

could not but wonder at
the needleſſe exceptions
againſt your Tenet; you
affirming no new thing
in that paſſage miſliked in
your Old Religion. And
this your Aduertiſement
(afterward) ſo fully and
punctually cleareth, and
your Reconciler ſo acquitteth,
with ſuch ſatiſfying
ingenuitie, that I
cannot imagin they haue
conſidered it well, or
meane wel, that ſhal perſiſt
to oppoſe it. For who
perceiues not, that your

Lordſhip leaues no more
to Rome, then our beſt
Diuines euer ſince the
Reformation haue granted?
If their ſpeeches
haue beene ſometimes
ſeemingly different, their
meaning hath beene alwayes
the ſame; that in
reſpect of the common
Truths yet profeſſed among
the Papiſts they
may, and ought to bee
tearmed, a True viſible.
Church, in oppoſition to
Iewes, Turkes, and Pagans,
who directly denie

the Foundation, howſoeuer
their Antichriſtian
aditions make them no
better then the Synagogue
of Sathan. This
being agreed vpon by
thoſe, whoſe Iudgement
wee haue good reaſon to
follow (cited in your Aduertiſement,
and by others)
they doe an ill office
to our Church (in
my opinion) who ſet
them at ods in this point,
that are ſo excellently reconciled;
and giue more
aduantage to the Aduerſarie

by quarrelling with
our worthies, then the
Aduerſarie is like to get
by our acknowledgment,
that they are ſuch a miſerable
Church, as we diſcouer
them to be. VVhat
I haue thought long ſince
in this behalfe, it appeareth
in my Lecture De
Viſibilitate Eccleſiae; and
as often as this hath come
in queſtion in our publicke
Diſputes, we determine
here no otherwiſe,
then your Lordſhip hath
ſtated it. And yet wee

truſt to giue as little vantage
to Poperie, as thoſe
that doe deteſt it; and are
as circumſpect to maintaine
our receiued Doctrine
and Diſcipline without
the leaſt ſcandall to
the weakeſt, as thoſe
that would ſeeme moſt
forward. That diſtinction
of Romes caſe before,
and ſince, the Councell
of Trent, holds not to diſ-Church
it; but ſhewes it
rather to be more incureable
now, then heretofore
Neither find I any particulars

obiected, which
thoſe worthy men haue
not ſufficiently cleared,
that haue iuſtifyed your
Aſſertion. Not to trouble
therefore your weightier
affairs with my needleſſe
interpoſition; As
that controuerſie about
the Altar (Ioſuah 22.) had
preſently a faire end vpon
the ful vnderſtanding
of the good meaning on
both ſides; ſo I truſt in
God this ſhall haue: In
which I am ſo perſwaded
that if it were to bee diſcuſſed

there after our
Scholaſticall manner, it
might well bee defended
either pro, or con, with out
preiudice to the Truth,
according to the full ſtating,
which your Aduertiſement,
and Reconciler
haue afforded. And thus,
with tender of my due obſeruance,
and Prayers for
your happineſſe, I reſt

            ¶To my Reuerend and
learned friend M. Doctor PRIMEROSE,
Preacher to the
French Church in
LONDON.
            
               WOrthy Maſter
Doctor Primeroſe;
you haue
beene long acknowledged a
great light in the Reformed
Churches of France;
hauing, for many yeeres,
ſhined in your orbe, the famous
Church of Burdeaux,
               
with notable effects, and
ſingular approbation both
for iudgment and ſinceritie;
both which alſo your learned
writings haue well approued;
So as your ſentence
cannot be liable to the danger
of any ſuſpition; Let me
intreate you to declare freely
what you hold concerning
the trueneſſe, and viſibilitie
of the Romane Church, as
it is by me explicated; And,
with all, to impart your
knowledg of the common
Tenet of thoſe foraine Diuines,
with whom you haue

ſo long conuerſed, concerning
this point; which (if I
miſtake not) onely a ſtubburne
ignorance will needs
make litigious. It grieues
my Soule to ſee the peace of
the Church troubled with
ſo abſurd a meſ priſon; In
exſpectation of your anſwer,
I take leaue, and commend
you, and your holy labours
to the bleſsing of our God.
Farewell; from
            
               Your louing Brother,
and fellow-labourer
IOS. EXON.
            
         
         
            
            To the Right Reuerend
Father in God, and my very
good Lord, IOSEPH
Biſhop of Exceter.
            
               Right Reuerend Father in God,
            
            
               I Haue beene ſo buſied
about my neceſſarie
ſtudies for
preaching on Sunday,
Tueſday, and this Thurſday,
that I could not giue ſooner
a full anſwer to your Lordſhips
Letter, which I receiued
on Friday laſt at night, whereby
I am deſired to declare freely

what I think concerning the
trueneſſe and viſibilitie of the
preſent Roman Church, as it is
by your Lordſhip explicated,
and what is the common tenet
of the forraine Diuines; with
whom I haue ſo long conuerſed
beyond the Seas, concerning
that point. I might anſwere in
two lines, that I haue read your
Reconciler, and iudge your opinion
concerning that point
to be learned, ſound, and true▪
Though that if I durſt fauour
an officious lie, I would willingly
giue my Suffrage to
thoſe Diuines which out of a
moſt feruent zeale to God, and
perfect hatred to Idolatry, hold
that the Roman Church is in all
things BABEL, in nothing
BETHEL. And as they which

ſeek to ſet right a crooked tree,
bow it the cleane contrary way
to make it ſtraight, ſo to recouer
and pull out of the fire of
eternall damnation, the Roman
Chriſtians, I would gladly
pourtray them with ſable colours,
and make their religion
more black in their owne eyes,
then they are in ours the helliſh
coloured faces of the flat-noſed
Ethiopians, or to the Spaniard
the monſtrous Sambenit of the
Inquiſition.
            But fearing the true reproch
caſt by Iob in his friends teeth,
Iob 13. 7. 
               Will you ſpeake wickedly for
God, and talke deceitfully for him?
and knowing that we muſt not
ſpeake a lie, no not againſt the
Deuill which is the Father
of lies, I ſay that the Roman
               
Church is both BABEL and
BETHEL, and as Gods Temple
was in Chriſts daies at once
Mat. 24. 13. 
               the houſe of Prayer, and a
den of theeues, ſo ſhee is in our
dayes,2. Theſ. 2. 4. 
               Gods Temple, and the
               Reuel. 18. 1, 2. 
               habitation of Deuils, the hold of
euery foule ſpirit, and a cage of
euery vncleane, and hatefull bird;
which I proue thus.
            The Church is to be conſidered
three manner of wayes.
Firſt according to Gods right
which he keepeth ouer her, and
maintaineth in her by the common
and externall calling of
his Word and Sacraments. Secondly,
according to the pure
preaching of the Word, and
externall obedience in hearing,
receiuing, and keeping the
Word ſyncerely preached.
            
               
               Thirdly, according to the election
of grace, and the perſonall
calling, which hath perpetually
the inward working
of the Holy Ghoſt ioyned with
the outward preaching of the
Word, as in
               Acts 16. 14. 
               Lydia. Thence
commeth1. Pet. 3. 21. 
               the anſwere of a
good conſcience toward God, by
the reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt.
            
            To begin with the laſt conſideration,
theſe only are Gods
Church which areRom. 2. 2
                     •
                   29. 
               Iewes inwardly
in the ſpirit, aſwell as outwardly
in the letter, whoſe prayſe
is not of men, but of God,
               Iohn 1. who
are Nathaniels, and true Iſraelites,
in whom there is no guile:
Inuiſible to all men: Viſible to
God alone,2. Tim. 2. 19. 
               who knoweth them
that are his, and each of them to
themſelues, becauſe1. Cor. 2. 12. 
               they haue

receiued the Spirit which is of
God, that they might know the
things which are freely giuen to
them of God, andReuel 2 17. 
               the white
ſtone, which no man knoweth, ſauing
he that receiueth it. Of this
Church called by the Apoſtle,
the people which God foreknew,
Rom. 11. there is no controuerſie
amongſt our Diuines.
            In the ſecond conſideration,
theſe onely are the true viſible
Church of God, amongſt
whom the Word of God is truly
preached without the mixture
of humane traditions, the
holy Sacraments are celebrated
according to their firſt inſtitution,
and the people conſenteth
to bee led and ruled by
the Word of God. As when
Exod 19. 7, 8. Exod. 24. 3, 7. Moſes laid before the faces of

the people all the words which the
Lord commanded him, and all the
people anſwered together, All
that the Lord hath ſpoken we will
doe, the Lord ſaid vnto Moſes,
               Exod. 34. 27. 
               Write thou theſe words: For after
the tenor of theſe words I haue
made a couenant with thee, and
with Iſrael: And Moſes ſaid to
the people,Dent. 26. 17, 18. 
               Thou hast auouched
this day the Lord to bee thy
thy God, &amp; to walke in his wayes;
and to keepe his Statutes, and his
Commandements, and his Iudgements,
&amp; to harken vnto his voice:
And the Lord hath auouched thee
this day to be his peculiar people, as
he hath promiſed thee, &amp; that thou
ſhouldeſt keepe all his Commandements.
This condition of the
Commandement GOD did
often inclucate into their eares

by his Prophets. As when
hee ſaid to them by Ieremiah,
               Ier. 7. 23. Ier. 1
                     •
                  . 4. 
               This thing commanded I them,
ſaying, Obey my voice, and I will
be your God, and yee ſhall bee my
people, and walke yee in all the
wayes, in that I haue commanded
you, that it may bee well vnto you.
            
            So in the Goſpell, Chriſt
ſaith,Iohn 10. 27. 
               My ſheepe heare my voice,
and I know them, and they follow
me. ButIohn 10. 7. 
               a ſtranger will they not
follow, but will flie from him: For
they know not the voice of ſtrangers:
where he giueth the firſt
marke of the viſibly true and
pure Church, to wit, the pure
preaching, and hearing of
Chriſts voice. As likewiſe Saint
Iohn ſaith,1. Iohn 4. 6. 
               He that knoweth God
heareth vs: hereby know wee the
Spirit of truth, and the ſpirit of

errour. Againe, the Lord ſaith,
Iohn 13. 35. 
               By this ſhall all men know that ye
are my Diſciples, if ye haue loue
one to another, pointing out the
concord and holy agreement
which is among the brethren,
as another marke of the orthodoxe
Church: As likewiſe
when hee ſaith,Matth. 5. 16. 
               Let your light
ſo ſhine before men, that they may
ſee your good workes, and glorifie
your Father which is in Heauen,
hee ſheweth that good workes
are the viſible mark of the true
orthodoxe Church: The true
preaching &amp; reuerent hearing
of the Goſpel, is a viſible mark
of our faith and hope: Our
concord in the Lord, is a marke
of our Charitie: Our good
workes are reall and ſenſible
teſtimonies of our inward

Faith, Hope, and Charitie.
Where wee finde theſe three
ſignes, we know certainly that
there is Chriſts true Church,
and iudge charitably, that is
probably, that euery one in
whom wee ſee theſe outward
tokens of Chriſts true and orthodoxe
Church, is a true
member of the myſticall body
of the Lord Ieſus. I ſay charitably,
becauſe outward markes
may be outwardly counterfeited
by Hypocrites, as it is ſaid
of Iſrael,Pſ. 78. 36. 37. 
               They did flatter with
their mouth, and they lyed vnto
him with their tongues, for their
heart was not right with him, neither
were they ſtedfaſt in his Couenant:
And of many of theſe that
followed our Sauiour,Iohn 2. 23. 24. 
               Many
beleeued in his Name, when they

ſaw the miracles which he did: But
Ieſus did not commit himſelfe vnto
them, becauſe he knew all men.
            
            Therefore when the people
of Iſrael departed from the
Couenant, and by their Idolatrie
brake, as much as in them
lay, the contract of marriage
betweene them and God, they
ceaſed in that behalfe, to bee
Gods true Spouſe and people,
though ſtill they called him
their Husband and their God.
When they made a molten
Calfe in the Wilderneſſe, and
worſhipped the works of▪ their
owne fingers, God ſaid to Moſes,
               Exod▪ 32. 7. 
               Thy people which thou
broughtest out of the land of Egypt,
haue corrupted themſelues,
and not my people. And Moſes
to ſhew that on their part they

had broken the Couenant,
Exod. 32. 19. 
               broken the Tables of the Couenant,
when vnder Achaz they
did worſe, Iſaiah called them
Eſay 1. 4, 9. 
               children that are corrupted, their
Prince and Gouernours, Rulers
of Sodome, themſelues, people of
Gomorrah. their holy Citie▪ 
               an
Harlot: And God about the
ſame time cried vnto them by
Micah,
               Micah. 2. 7, 8. 
               Thou that art named the
houſe of Iacob: Thou that was 
                     ••
                  late
my people. And to the teh
Tribes by Hoſea,
               Hoſea 4. 17. 
               Yee are not
my people, and I will not bee your
God: After the ſame manner
Chriſt ſaid to the Iewes, which
gloried and made their boaſt
that God was their Father,Iohn 8. 42. 4
                     •
                  . If
God were your Father, yee would
loue me; Yee are of your father the
Deuill: And the luſts of your Father
yee will doe?
            
               
If we ſpeake of the Romiſh
Church according to this diſtinction,
defining the Church
by the keeping of the Couenant
in pureneſſe of doctrine,
and holineſſe of life, God himſelfe
hath ſtript her of that glorious
Name, calling herReuel. 11. 8. 
               ſpiritually
Sodome, Egypt, and
               Reuel. 14 
                     •
                  
                
               Babylon.
Sodome in the pollution
of her moſt filthy life; Egypt in
the abominable multitude of
her filthy Idols; Babylon in the
cruell and bloudie oppreſſion
and perſecution of the Saints.
And becauſe ſhe was to cal her
ſelfe as falſly as arrogantly the
mother Church, the Angell calleth
her THE MOTHER OF
HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS
OF THE EARTH:
Becauſe alſo ſhee was to bring

and magnifie her ſelfe in the
multitude of her Saints, hee
ſaith, thatReuel. 17. 5, 6 
               ſhee is drunke with the
bloud of the Saints, and with the
bloud of the Martyrs of Ieſus.
And taking from her the name
of the Church, which ſhe challengeth
priuatiuely to all other
Chriſtian congregations, hee
nameth her, as I haue already
ſaid,Reuel. 18. 2. 
               the habitation of Deuils,
the hold of euerie foule ſpirit, and a
Cage of euerie vncleane and hatefull
bird.
            
            In the firſt ſence Moſes ſaid
to God,Exod. 32. 11. 
               why doth thy wrath wax
hote againſt THY people: becauſe
although they had broken
the Couenant on their part
by the workes of their hands,
God had not as yet broken it
on his part. Ieremiah in the greateſt

heate of their monſtruous
I dolatries prayed after the
ſame maner,Iere. 14 21. 
               Doe not abhorre
vs for thy Names ſake, doe not diſgrace
the Throne of thy glorie: Remember,
breake not thy Couenant
with vs. And Eſaiah,
               Eſa. 64. 8, 9. 
               Thou
art our Father, we are ALL thy
people. For ſo long as God cals
a people to him by his word
and Sacraments, and honoureth
them with his name: So
long alſo as they conſent to be
called by his name, profeſſing
it outwardly, they remaine his
people, although they anſwere
not his calling, neither in
ſoundneſſe of faith, nor in holineſſe
of life. Euen as rebellious
Subiects are ſtill true Subiects
on the Kings behalfe,
who looſeth not his right by

their Rebellion: Nay on their
owne alſo in ſome maner, becauſe
they ſtill keepe and profeſſe
his Name, and giue not
themſelues to any forraine
Prince. Did Dauid looſe his
right by the Rebellion of the
people vnder his ſonne Abſalom!
And therefore when the
King ſubdueth theſe traitours,
hee carrieth himſelfe towards
them, both in forgiuing and in
puniſhing, as their lawfull and
naturall Prince, and not as a
Conquerour of new Subiects.
So as a ſtrumpet is a true wife,
ſo long as her husband conſents
to dwell with her, and
ſhee is named by his name;
And as Agar when ſhee fled
from her miſtreſſe Sarai, was
ſtill Sarais maide, as ſhee confeſſed,

ſaying,Gene. 16. 8. 
               I flee from the
face of my miſtreſſe Sarai. In like
manner a rebellious, fugitiue,
and whooring Church, is ſtill
a true Church, ſo long as God
keeping the right of a King, of
a Maſter, of a Husband ouer
her, giueth her not the bill of
Diuorcement, but conſents
that her Name bee called vpon
her, and ſhee ſtill calleth her
ſelfe his kingdome, his maide,
his wife. Thus God calleth the
Iewes His people, euen then
when he ſaid they were not his
people, becauſe hee had not
broken the band of marriage
with them, and put them away
by diuorcement. Therefore he
ſaid vnto them,Eſa. 50. 
               Where are the
Letters of your mothers diuorcement,
whom I haue put away?
               
Meaning he had not giuen vnto
them a writing of diuorcement,
but did ſtill acknowledge
them to bee his ſpouſe,
notwithſtanding their manifold
and moſt filthy Whoredomes
with falſe Gods, which
he charged them with, ſaying
vnto them by Ieremiah,
               Iere. 3. 14. 
               Thou
haſt polluted the land with thy
whooredomes, and with thy wickedneſſe:
Thou hast a whoores
forehead, and refuſeſt to bee aſhamed,
wilt thou not for this time cry
vnto me, my father thou art the
guide of my youth. Turne, O backſliding
children, ſaith the Lord, for
I am married vnto you: Or according
to the French tranſlation,
I haue the right of an Huſband
ouer you. So after hee had
called the ten TribesHoſea 1. 6, 9. 
               Lo-ruhama,

and Lo-hammi, ſaying, hee
would no more haue mercie
vpon them, and that they were
not his people, he calleth them
his people,Hoſea 4. 12. 
               My people, ſaith he,
asketh counſell at their ſtickes, and
their ſtuffe anſwereth them.
            
            But after that God had ſcattered
them among the Medes
and other nations of Aſſyria,
and broken his couenant with
them, they became not onely
in the ſecond, but alſo in the
firſt ſence. Ieſrehel, and no more
Iſrael, Lo-ruhama, and no more
Ruhama, Lo-hammi, &amp; no more
Hammi. Then was fulfilled the
the propheſie,Hoſea 2. 2. 
               Plead with your
mother, plead: For ſhee is not my
wife, neither am I her husband. So
the Iewes which were Gods
people in the midſt of their idolatrie,

ſince they haue denied
Chriſt to bee the Meſſias, the
Mediatour betweene GOD
and them, and haue crucified
the Lord of glory, are no more
Gods people, although they
beg ſtill that name.Reuel. 3. 9. 
               They are,
ſaith Chriſt, the Synagogue of Satan:
They ſay they are Iewes, and
are not, but doe lye: For ſeeing
GodRom. 11 17. hath broken them off,
and grafted the Gentiles in
their roome, they qualifie
themſelues Gods people as
falſely and iniuriouſly, as a
whoore lawfully diuorced by
her husband, calleth her ſelfe
his wife.
            To applie this to the Romane
Church, which hath adulterated
and corrupted the
whole ſeruice of God, and is

more adulterous then was at
any time Iuda or Ephraim, and
therefore is not a true viſible
Church in the ſecond ſence, I
ſay ſhee is one in ſome ſort in
the firſt. In her God doth ſtill
keepe his true word in the Old
and New Teſtament, as the
contract of his marriage with
her. In her is the true Creed,
the true Decalogue, the true
Lords Prayer, which Luther
calleth the kernel of Chriſtianitie:
In her Chriſt is Preached,
though corruptly. In her the
Trinitie and Incarnation of
Chriſt are beleeued: In her
the Father, the Sonne and the
Holy Ghoſt are prayed vnto,
though in an vnknown tongue
to the moſt part: In her the little
children are Baptiſed in the

Name of the Father, of the
Sonne, and of the Holy Ghoſt.
And no Diuine will denie that
their Baptiſme is a true Sacrament,
whereby their children
are borne to God, ſeeing wee
doe not rebaptiſe them, where
leauing her, they adioyne
themſelues to vs. Who then
can denie, that ſhee is a true
Church? For out of the Church
there is no Baptiſme, and the
Church alone beareth children
to God. In her ſitteth the man
of ſinne, the ſonne of perdition,
who ſitteth2. Theſſ. 2. 4. 
               in the Temple
of God, which is the Church.
Its graunted that ſhee is Babylon
in the ſecond ſence: And
Reuel. 18. 4. 
               Gods people is commanded to
come out of Babylon. What is
Gods people, but Gods Church

which forſaketh her ſucceſſiuely,
as of old the typicall people
came out of the typicall Babylon,
not at once, but at many
ſeuerall times? If then we applie
vnto her Gods commandement,
exhorting her to
come out of Babylon, either
wee vnderſtand not what wee
ſay, or we acknowledge her to
bee Gods people, that is Gods
Church, though idolatrous,
rebellious, and diſobedient:
Neither ſhall ſhee ceaſe to bee
Gods people in this ſence, till
the comming of the bleſſed
day, when the ayre ſhall rebound
with the ſhouting of
the Saints,Reuel. 14. 8. 
               Babylon is fallen,
ſhee is fallen that great Citie, becauſe
ſhee made all nations drunke
with the wine of the wrath of her
fornication.
            
            
               
I ſay then, that as Ieruſalem
was at the ſame time the holy
Citie, and a Harlot, the Temple
was Bethel and Bethauen, Gods
Houſe, and a houſe of Iniquitie,
the Iewes were Gods people,
and no people, Gods children &amp;
the Deuils, Ephraim was Idammi
and Lo-Hammi, in diuers r
                  •
               
               ſpects,
euen ſo the Romiſh
Church is both BETHEL and
BABEL, Bethel from God,
calling her to the communion
of his grace in Chriſt by his
Word, and Sacrament of Baptiſme,
Babel from her ſelfe, becauſe
ſhee hath made a gallimaufrey
of the Chriſtian Religion,
confounding pell-mell
her owne traditions with Gods
Word, her owne merits with
Chriſts, the bloud of Martyrs

with the bloud of the Lambe
of God,Iohn 1. 29. 
               which taketh away the
ſinne of the world, Purgatorie
with the ſame bloud,1. Iohn 1. 7. 
               which
purgeth vs from all ſinne, Iuſtification
by workes with Iuſtification
Gal. 2. 16. 
               by faith only, praying
to the Creatures with praying
to the Creator, Idols of men,
women, beaſts, Angels with
Gods worſhip, the mediation
of Saints with the mediation
of him who isHeb. 7. 22, 25. 
               the ſuretie of the
new Teſtament, and is able to ſaue
to the vttermoſt all thoſe that come
vnto God by him, ſeeing hee euer
liueth to make interceſsion for
them. Nay, as Caluin ſaid truly,
in the Romiſh Church Chriſt
is ſcarcely knowne among the
Saints, of whom ſome are in
Heauen, as the Apoſtles, &amp;c.

ſome on Earth, as the Pope,
ſome in Hell, as Saint George an
Arrian Hereticke, and bloudie
Butcher of true Chriſtians,
Saint Dominicke the firebrand
of the warre againſt the Albigeois,
Saint Garnet whom Tyburne
ſent to his owne place,
to bee rewarded of the Gunnepowder
Treaſon: Some did
neuer die, becauſe they had
neuer the honour to liue, as
Saint Christopher, Saint Katherine,
Saint Vrſule, Saint Longin,
who was a Speare. Saint Eloi
who was two couple of ſharpe
nailes, and many more of the
ſame ſtuffe. In a word, the roaring
of the Camards of Bahal
is ſo lowd in that Church, that
Chriſts voice is ſcant heard in
her, and yet heard both in the

mouth of theſe Babylonian
builders, which vnderſtand
not one another, and in the
mouthes of the people halting
betweene Chriſt and the Pope
their Bahal. And therefore in
that behalfe not the true, but a
true Chriſtian Church.
            
            This teſtimony is the praiſe
of the moſt wonderfull patience
of God, who ſuffereth ſo
long that common hackney to
beare his Name. It is her ſhame,
As it is the ſhame of a Queane
married to a good husband, to
be conuicted of running vp &amp;
downe after ſtrangers Its a
vantage to vs in our imployment
for her conuerſion. For
as when Agar had confeſſed
truly that ſhe was Sarahs maid,
the Angell tooke her at her

word, ſaying,Gen. 16. 9. 
               Returne to thy
Miſtreſſe, and ſubmit thy ſelfe to
her, and perſwaded her: Euen
ſo wee take the Roman Church
by the necke, when ſhee confeſſeth
that ſhee is Chriſts
Church, as ſhee is indeed, exhorting
her to returne vnto
Chriſt, to obey his Word, to
ſubmit her ſelfe vnto him, and
to folow the true Faith of the
ancient Catholicke and Apoſtolicke
Church. Neither is it
any vantage to her againſt vs,
to inforce vs to returne to her,
or to vpbraid vs for forſaking
her. For as Moſes, when the
people had committed Idolatrie,
Exod. 33. 7. 
               tooke his Tabernacle, and
pitched it without the Campe,
afarre off from the Campe, breaking
of all communication

with thoſe which had broken
the Couenant of the LORD
their God, till they repented:
As God ſaid to Ieremiah, of the
Iewes, which hadEzech. 16. 25. opened their
legges to euery one that paſſed
by, &amp; multiplied their whoredomes,
Ier. 15. 1. 19. 
               Caſt them out of my
fight, and let them goe forth: Let
them returne vnto thee: but returne
not thou vnto them. As Hoſea
ſaid of Ephraim,
               Hoſea 4. 17. 
               Ephraim
is ioyned to Idols, let him alone:
So Chriſt ſaith vnto vs,Reuel. 18. 1. 
               Come
out of Babylon, my people, that yee
be not partakers of her ſinnes: and
that ye receiue not of her plagues:
Her ſinnes are a ſpirituall leproſie.
And we run away from
leprous men, though true men,
and our neereſt and deareſt
friends, crying what they are

loth to cry,Leuit. 13. 45. 
               Vncleane vncleane,
leſt their breath ſhould infect
vs: Her ſinnes are infidelitie,
not negatiue, but pri
                  •
               atiue,
not in whole, but in part; As
Saint Paul a beleeuing lew was
in vnbeliefe when he perſceuted
the Church: And Saint Paul
ſaith vnto vs2. Cor. 6. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. 
               Be ye not vnequally
yoked together with vnbeleeuers,
&amp;c. Come out from among
them, and be ye ſeparate, ſaith the
Lord, and touch not the vncleane
thing, and I will receiue you, and
will be a Father vnto you, and yee
ſhall bee my ſonnes and daughters,
ſaith the Lord Almightie. A faithfull
ſubiect will not take a traitour,
though a ſubiect, by the
hand, nor I a Papiſt in matter
of his Religion: Neither will
honeſt women 
                  〈…〉
               
               
with the greateſt Lady, thogh
ſhee be a great ones wife.
            This I haue euer taught
priuately, Preached publikely,
publiſhed in Printed Bookes againſt
Papiſts, during theſe
thirtie three yeares of my Miniſtrie
in the French Churches,
without any aduantage to our
Aduerſaries, without any contradiction
of our diuines, without
any acception taken againſt
it by our Churches, or
any particular among the brethren,
which all in their name
Preach and publiſh that they
are of the ſame mind, calling
themſelues The Reformed Churches,
and our Religion The reformed
religion. For as the good
Kings of Iuda did not build a
new Temple, call to God a

new people, ſet vp a new Religion,
but repurge and clenſe
the old Temple, reſtore the ancient
Religion, exhorted Gods
people to ſhake off the new inuentions
of the new patched
Religion, and to returne to the
Lord their God by the olde
way, which their fathers had
beaten, and Moſes had traced
vnto them in the Law; And as
Zorobabel, Eſdras,
               N
                     •
                  h
                     •
                  . 3. &amp; 4. 
               Nehemiah,
Ieſhuah, builded the Wals of
Ieruſalem vpon the ancient
foundation, euerie man building
next himſelfe; Euen ſo
the Proteſtant Diuines haue
euerie one next himſelfe, not
builded a new Church vpon a
new foundation, but repurged
the auncient Church of idolatrie,
ſuperſtition, falſe interpretations

of the Scriptures,
and traditions of men, whereof
ſhee was fuller then euer
Augeas his Stable was full of
mucke, but beaten downe, and
burned with the fire of Gods
word the Wals1. Cor. 3. 20, 10, 11. 
               of Wood, Hay,
Stubble, which the Babylonian
builders had rayſed vpon the
old foundation, which is Chriſt
Ieſus, and edified vpon it a
faire Palace of Siluer, Gold, precious
Stones. This ſame is the
opinion alſo of my Collegues
of the French Church of this
Citie of London.
            If any ſelfe-conceited Chriſtian
thinketh this an aduantage,
rather then a diſparagement
&amp; diſgrace to that punke,
the Romane Church, and taketh
thereby occaſion to perſeuere

to be her Bawd or Stalion, and
to runne a whoring with her,
I ſay with the Pſalmiſt,Pſal. 36. 3. 
               The
wicked hath left off to bee wiſe,
and to doe good, And with the
Angell,Reuel. 22. 11. 
               Hee that is vniuſt, let
him he vniust ſtill: And he which
is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill: For
neither muſt an honeſt heart
ſpeake a lie for the good that
may come of it; Nor conceale
in time and place a neceſſarie
truth for any euill that may
inſue of it. If it harden more
and more the flintie hearts of
ſome vnto death, it will ſoften
and melt the iron hearts of others
vnto life, that ſeeing among
vs the mudde and dirt of
humane traditions, wherewith
the Pope and his Clergie had
furred and ſoyled the brightſhining

glaſſe of the Goſpel, wiped
away from this heauenly
mirror of Gods fauor, they may
come vnto vs, and2. Cor. 3. 18 beholding
with open face, as in a glaſſe,
the glorie of the Lord, may be
changed with vs into the ſame
image, from gloire to glorie,
euen as by the Spirit of the
Lord.
            Which laſt effect I pray
with my heart your Reconciler
may haue with thoſe that
are children of peace: And ſo
recommending your Lordſhip,
with all your learned, eloquent,
ſound, and vſefull
labours to GODS moſt
powerfull bleſſing and my ſelfe
to the continuance of your

godly Prayers, and old
friendſhip, I remaine
for
euer
            
               Your Lordſhips moſt humble
and affectionate
Seruant,

               From London the 26.
of Februarie, 1629.
               
            
         
         
            
            ¶To my VVorthy and
much reſpected Friend
Mr. H. CHOMLEY.
            
               MAſter Cholmely,
I haue peruſed
your learned and
full reply to Maſter Burtons
anſwere; wherein you
haue in a iudicious eye abundantly
righted your ſelf,
and cleared a iuſt cauſe; ſo,

as the Reader would wonder
where an Aduerſarie
might find ground to raiſe
an oppoſition; But, let me
tell you, Were it a Booke
written by the pen of an
Angeſt from Heauen, in
this ſubiect, I ſhould doubt
whether to wiſh it publique.
How true, how iuſt ſoeuer
the plea be, I find (ſuch is
the ſelfe-loue, and partialitie
of our corrupt nature)
the quarrell is inlarged by
multiplying of words; when
I ſee a fire quenched with
Oyle, I will expect to ſee a

controuerſie of this nature,
ſtinted by publike altercation.
New matter ſtill riſes
in the agitation, and giues
hint to a fore-reſolued oppoſite,
of a freſh diſquiſition:
So as we may ſooner ſee an
end of the common peace,
then of an vnkindly iarre in
the Church; eſpecially ſuch
a one, as is fomented with a
miſtaken Zeale on the one
ſide, and with a confidence
of knowledge, on the other.
Silence hath ſomtimes quieted
ſuch like miſ-raiſed brabbles,
neuer, interchange of

words; This very queſtion
was on foot, ſome fortie
yeares agoe, in the hote
chaſe of great Authors, but,
whether through the ingenuitie
of the parties, or ſome
ouer-ruling act of Diuine
Prouidence, it ſoone died,
without noyſe; ſo I wiſh it
may now doe; Rather let
the weaker title goe away
with the laſt word, then the
Church ſhall bee distracted;
For that Poſition of mine,
which occaſioned your vindication,
you ſee it ſufficiently
abetted, and determined,

by ſo reuerend authoritie,
as admits no exception;
I dare ſay; No learned
Diuine of our owne
Church, or the foraine, can
but ſubſcribe (in this our
ſenſe) to the iudgement of
theſe Worthies; To draw
forth therefore this cord of
contention to any futher
length, were no leſſe needleſſe,
then preiudiciall to
the publike peace; Hee is
not worthy to bee ſatisfied,
that will yet wrangle.
            As for thoſe perſonall
aſperſions that are caſt vpon

you by malice, be perſwaded
to deſpiſe them. Theſe Weſterne
parts, where your reputation
is deſeruedly precious,
know your Zeale for
Gods truth no leſſe feruent,
(though better gouerned)
then the most fierie of your
Cenſurers; No man more
hateth Popiſh Superſtition;
only your fault is, that you
doe not more hate errour,
then iniuſtice; and cannot
abide wrong meaſure offered
to the worst enemie.
Neither bee you troubled
with that idle exprobration

of a Prebendary retribution;
who would care for a
contumely ſo void of truth?
God knowes that worthleſſe
gift was conferred vpon you,
ere this taske came into either
of our thoughts; And
who ſo knowes the entire
reſpects betwixt vs, from
our very cradles, till this
day, may well thinke that
a Prebend of three pounds
by yeare, need not go for a
fee, where there is ſo much,
and ſo ancient cauſe of
deareneſſe: I am ſorrie to
ſee ſuch rancour vnder the

cote of Zeale; Surely, nothing
but mere malice can
bee guiltie of this charge;
no leſſe then of that other
enuious challenge of your
decay of graces, of falling
from your firſt loue, from
induſtry to eaſe, from a
weekly, to a Monethly
preaching; When thoſe
that know the ſtate of your
Tiuerton, the foure-parted
diuiſion of that charge,
and your forced confinement
to your owne day, by
publique authoritie, both
Spirituall, and Temporall,

must needs acquit you, and
cry downe the wrong of an
accuſer; As for the vigour
of Gods good graces in you,
both common, and ſanctifying,
all the Countrie are
your ample witneſſes; I that
haue interknowne you from
our childhoods, cannot but
profeſſe to find the entrance
of your age no leſſe aboue
the beſt of your youth in
abilities, then in time; and
ſtill, no leſſe fruitfull in
promiſes; of increaſe, then
in eminent performances.
What need I vrge this?

your Aduerſaries do enough
feele your worth; So as (to
ſpeake ſeriouſly) I cannot
ſufficiently wonder at the
libertie of thoſe men, who
profeſsing a ſtrict conſcience
of their wayes, dare let their
pens, or tongues looſe to ſo
iniurious and vncharitable
detraction, whereof they
know the iuſt auenger is in
Heauen; It ſhould not be
thus betwixt Brethren, no
not with enemies.
            For the mayne buſineſſe;
There wants not confidence
on either ſide; I am appealed

to by hoth; an vnmeet Iudge,
conſidering my ſo deepe ingagements.
But, if my vmperage
may ſtand, I award
an eternall ſilence to both
parts; Sit downe in peace,
then, you, and your worthy
ſecond; Whoſe yong ripenes,
and modest and learned diſcourſe,
is worthy of better
intertainment then contempt;
And let your Zealous
Opponents ſay, that
you haue ouer-comne your
ſelues in a reſolued ceſſation
of pens; and them, in a
loue of peace.
            
               
Farewell, from your louing
Friend and ancient Colleague.
