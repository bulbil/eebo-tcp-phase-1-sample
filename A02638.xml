            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                  ¶ Edward the fourth.
                  
                     AFTER TAHT EDVVARD had vāquiſhed &amp; put to flight Henry the ſixte, beyng then verie ioious and proude (partely thorowe yt victorie that he had gotten and partely for that the commons began to cleaue vn to hym and to take his parte, and lykewiſe did the ſtates of the realme) then departed he with all conuenyent ſpede to London, and ther aſſemblyng his counſaill together, was ſhortely after proclaimed kyng at Weſtminſter yt nyne and twēty daye of Iune and was called Edward the fourth of that name after Wyllyam the conquerour, and this was in the yere of Chriſt his incarnacion a thouſand foure hundred three ſcore and one. And the ſelf ſame yere kyng Edward held The firſt yere. his parliamēt again, in the whiche, firſt the realme was ſette in good ordre, and all thynges wholy redreſſed, whiche was very good &amp; expedient for the commen weale, for yt it had not been looked to all y• tyme that ciuile battaill did continue. And alſo thorowe his decree &amp; will, all ye ſtatutes that kyng Hēry yt ſixt had made, was vtterly abrogated &amp; of no vertue or ſtrength, finally his twoo brethren yt wer younger then he, George was made duke of Clarence, and Rychard duke of Glouceſtre, and Iohn the brother of Rychard Erle of Warwike, was made marques Montacute, and Henry Burchire

the brother of Thomas biſhop of Caunturbury erle of Eſſex, and Wyllyam Faucounbridge erle of Kent, &amp; this Henry Burchire beeyng a noble manne &amp; mooſt puiſſaunte in feactes of warre had gyuen hym to mariage the ſuſter of Rychard duke of Yorke, called Elizabeth. And for this cauſe chiefely, that the ſaid Rychard might haue his aſſiſtaūce and helpe of hym in all maner of aduerſitie that ſhould chaūce, either by battaill or other wiſe and that he did, after that kyng Edward the ſoonne of the ſame Rychard had made hym erle of Eſſer, tothend yt bothe the father &amp; the ſoōne might at all tymes bee a ſure fortreſſe and defēce for hym And he had begotten of this Elizabeth in laufull mariage foure menne children, yt is to ſaie, Wyllyam, Thomas, Iohn, and Henry, and one doughter called Iſabell, the whiche liued but a ſhorte ſpace, the whiche ſoonnes vſed greate diligence in bryngyng matters to paſſe, &amp; in weightie affaires and buſynes very laborious, in aduentures and ieoperdies manly and bold, and in forſeyng thynges very circumſpect, but ſpecially Wyllyam the eldeſt had all theſe qualities. This Wylliam maried Anne a mayden diſcēdyng of high parentage and of mooſt pure virginitie, the doughter of Iames Luſſheburne erle of ſainct Paule, by whome he had Henry nowe erle of Eſſex, alſo Cicile and Iſabell doughters, the whiche Iſabell died before ſhe was ripe to mariage, and yt other was maried to Walter Ferryſe. But to come to that I ſpake in the begynnyng.
                  When all thynges chaunſed thus luckely to Edward, and that all was as he would haue it,

Henry the duke of Somerſet fearyng that kyng Howe Hē
                        ry yt duke of Somerſette lefte kyng Hē
                        ry the .vi. and fled to kyng Edward and after repented &amp; fled againe to Hē
                        ry the .vi. Henry ſhould goo to wracke, and take the woorſe, fled to kyng Edward, of whome he was after the mooſt gentle ſorte intertayned, but ſone after it repented hym of his deede, for in the meane ſeaſon kyng Henry had gotte a greate power of Scotiſh menne, &amp; vnwittyng to Edward gat Dureſme, the whiche thyng after hearde, the duke of Somerſet fled priuely to hym, with a greate compaign
                        •
                     e of yt kyng his frēdes folowyng after, and ſo many for deſire of lucre and vaūtage did turne to hym, that Henry was thought to haue as greate an armie as his enemie had. The whiche armie he made menne thynke to bee the greater for yt he did ſpoile and deſtroye townes and feldes where ſoeuer he came, &amp; ſo by long burnyng and waſtyng he came to a village called Exham, where as he buckeled The diſcomfitur of Henry the ſixt. with Iohn marques Montacute whome he mette there, and there fightyng very ſharpely, as often tymes it had chaunſed before, was putte to flight, loſyng the greateſt noūbre of his hooſt, &amp; he hymſelf with a fewe ino, went in all the haſt to Scotland, and the reſidue fled, ſome one waye and ſome an other to ſaue their liues. Ther was taken there priſoners, Henry duke of Somerſet, Robert duke of Hungerforde, and Thomas Roſſe, the whiche duke of Somerſet was putte to death by and by The duke of Somerſet taken &amp; beheded for that he had chaunged his mynde ſo ſone and went to ye other partie, the other were had to Newe caſtell, and ther beyng for a ſeaſon were putte to death in like maner, wherby other ſhould haue no truſt of any victorie, when their capitaines were dedde &amp; gone. Albeit kyng Edward nowe might

thynke all thynges to be wel, and him ſelfe ſtrong enough agaynſt the power of hys enemy for that he had gotte ſuche a vyctorye, yet dyd he wyth all dylygence prouyde that Margarete kynge Henrye the .vi. hys wife, ſhulde at no hande be let into Englande for feare of wynnynge mennes hartes to her. Wherefore, he made bulwarkes &amp; ſure for treſſes on euerye parte and coaſtes of hys realme that there myghte be no landynge, and dyd wryte to all theim of the ſouthe partes, that they ſhulde in nowyſe take in anye woman, or helpe anye, for yf anye ſo dyd, he ſhulde be taken as an enemye &amp; an hyghe traytoure to the crowne, as they were agaynſte whome he dyd fyghte.
                  And of that parte that is nygh to the Scotiſh bancke, he layed watches, that none ſhoulde goo oute of the realme to kynge Henrye. But kynge The takynge of Hēry the xyxte▪
                      Henrye hym ſelfe was neuer in anye greate feare whatſoeuer chaunced, in ſo muche that he came in to England in a dyſguyſed apparel, and then beinge knowen and taken of certayne ſpyes ſone after he had come in, was caried to London to king Edwarde, and there layde in holde. After whoſe attachynge and impryſonmente, the realme was ſet in more quyetnes. Wherfore, Edwarde nowe beynge oute of all feare and daunger of hys enemyes, dyd wholy ſet hym ſelfe the foure yeres after enſuynge to the reformatyon and redreſſynge of hys publyke weale, and to the recompenſynge of hys ſouldyers for their paynes: did deuyde and geue the landes of theim that were wyth kynge Henrye to hys owne, and ſo wyth geuynge large and ample rewardes, dyd get the fauoure of all

hys people as well the laye as the nobles, and vſynge ſuche vrbanyte and clemencye to all kinde of men, that he had throughlye wonne the hartes of all men: the whyche gentylnes and fryndely famyliaritee he dyd euer after vſe. Alſo as for the lawes of the realme he dyd alter and mend ſome, and ſome he made newe, beſydes that he coyned monye as wel golde as ſyluer, the whyche at this The coynynge of royalles &amp; nobles. daye is currante. The whyche golde was royals, and nobles, and the ſyluer, was grotes, ſo that in hys tyme thys kinde of coyne came vp.
                  And after that hys realme was in thys ſtate he made a proclamation, that yf anye manne beyng a traytoure or rebellyon hertofore to hys grace, &amp; wyllyng to ſubmyt hym ſelfe wholy to hym ſhuld haue his pardon, and other that wolde not, ſhuld die, and ſuffer according to the lawes. The which kyndnes and natyue loue dyd cauſe hym to haue the good wyl and herte of his commons, ſo much that it is euydent, he was al the dayes of hys lyfe a conqueroure, through the helpe and ayde of thē in ſo much, that hys enemyes were euer ſhamefully put to wrack, as it ſhalbe ſhewed more playnly hereafter. And alſo not contented wyth the frendſhyppe of hys owne countree menne, dyd wynne and procure the loue of foren and ſtraunge prynces, and made theim to bee of kynred wyth hym, whereby that they myghte, (yf nede ſhoulde ſo requyre) ayde and ſocour him, or at the leaſt, not bee iniurious or noyſome to hym. So that he maried hys ſyſter lady Margarete, to Charles the ſonne of Phylyppe duke of Burgoyne, throughe which maryage he had greate helpe at the inſurrection

that chaunſed in thys his natiue countree, and after that ſente Rycharde the erle of Warwyke embaſſadoure into Fraunce, the whyche ſhoulde deſyre for hym to wyfe, a mayden called Bona, the ſyſter of Carlotta the quene of Fraunce, and the doughter of Lewes duke of Sauoye, whyche after dyd marye Iohn Galeot duke of Mylayne, the whyche buſynes dyd cauſe cyuile battayle to bee. For in the meane tyme that the earle wente in to Fraunce, and had ſpoken wyth Lewes the kynge, wyth whom the ladie Bona was, and wayted vpon the quene her ſyſter, Edwarde chaungynge hys mynde, maryed ladye Elyzabeth the doughter of Rycharde the earle of Ryuers, which was maryed before to ſyr Iohn Gray knyght, by whome ſhe had two chyldren, Thomas and Rycharde, of the whyche maryage, for the humylytie or baſenes of ſtocke that the lady was of, he wold no prynce or kynges to haue knowne of it, no not ſo muche as her owne father Rycharde the earle, for the whyche cauſe, when it was blaſed abrode, euerye man dyd meruayle greatelye, kynges and prynces were dyſpleaſed and grudged at it, and ſayde playnelye, that it was not for hys honoure ſo to dooe, and beganne to reproue the foreſayde maryage ſhamefullye, and for that he was led rather by blynde Cupyde, than by anye reaſon, they dyd inceſſaūtlye reproue the ſame. And ether thys was the cauſe of the ſedycion whyche afterwarde dyd ryſe betwyxte kynge Edwarde and the earle of Warwycke, or els the pryuie enuye and malice whiche was in both theyr hertes nowe braſtynge out, wherby, an occaſiō or quarel might be picked

For Edward after that he had got his kyngdome (as it was openly knowne) by the erle of Warwykes meane and helpe, begonne to ſuſpect hym for that he was in ſuch authoritee, ſo that he woulde haue plucked ſomewhat frome him &amp; diminiſhed his powre, wherby he myght haue ruled all thynges at his owne pleaſure both in hys owne countree, &amp; in other nacions. So that a man may ſee, it ofte chaunceth yt frendes will geue very ſeldome condygne rewarde to a mans deſeruinges, yea, &amp; eftſones when a greate benefite is beſtowed or cō
                     ferred vpon theim, thei will like ingrate perſons nothyng cōſider it. Of this ye earle of Warwycke was not vnknowing, ye whiche although he loked for better thankes &amp; a more ample benefite at his hādes, yet neuertheles, he thought beſt to diſſēble and cloke y• matter, vntill ſuch oportunitie might be had; wherby he myght, conſidering the wylfulnes of the kynge exprobrate vnto hym the pleaſures yt he had done for him. And it is verye true and euidēt that king Edward dyd make ſerche in his houſe for a thing that touched much his honeſtie, wher the earle in dede was a man that loued women well, and had great fanteſie to their company. But what ſoeuer it was, ether euell wyll, or deſire of the empire that theyr league ſhuld bee infringed or broken, after that the earle had ſure knowledge by the letters of hys frendes that the king had got him a wife priuely and yt al yt he had done with king Lewis in his embaſſad for the ioyning of this newe affinitee was but fruſtrate and in vain, he was ſo erneſtly moued with it, that he thought beſt that the kynge ſhuld be depoſed frō
                     
the crowne, and as one not worthy of ſuch a kingly offyce. But to oure purpoſe. The earle of Warwyke beyng then ſore vexed, and moued wyth the kynge, leaſt yt in this his furoure hys intēt beyng raſhely gone aboute, ſhulde bee broughte to no good ende, he determined ſo lōge to ſuffer &amp; beare ſuche iniuries, vntyll ſuche tyme that he myghte brynge his matters to paſſe as he wolde haue thē whiche ſhortly after came into Englande, and ſalutyng the kynge, dyd hys meſſage vnto hym, makinge hym ſelfe to bee ignoraunte of that maryage. And after that, the earle throughe the licence of the king went into his ſhyre of Warwike, partly to take his pleaſure, and partly for the preſeruation of his ſafetie and helth, whyche was the yere The ſixt yere. of oure lorde God a. M .CCCC .lxvii. and the. vi yeare of the reygne of kynge Edwarde. In the whiche yeare, George Neuell brother to the earle was made archebyſhoppe of Yorke, after the dyſceaſe of Wyllyam late archebyſhoppe before him beeynge the .lii. byſhoppe that had poſſeſſed that rome, and Phylyppe duke of Burgoyne dyed the ſame yeare, and Charles hys ſoonne was made duke, a manne bothe for manhode and valyantenes in warre moſte exellente. Thys Rycharde as we ſayde before, was in hys ſhyre of Warwycke, and there callynge to hym George the archebyſſhope of yorke, and Iohn Montacure Marques hys brethren bothe, and after long communycation had of many thinges, the ſpace of .ii. or .iii. dayes, at length gettynge meete occaſion to ſpeake of the kynge and hys doinges, dyd ſhewe hys mind to theim, deſyrynge theim, by all the wayes that

he coulde poſſyble, to take kynge Henry hys part and to helpe him to the crowne, ſaiynge after this wyſe and maner. Brethren, it is not of anye lyghtenes of mynde, but of playne iudgemente that I am moued to ſpeake of kynge Edward and king Henrye. Thys Henrye is a very godlye manne, and loueth theim that bee hys faythfull ſubiectes and doth cōſyder alſo who taketh paynes for him whyche hathe a ſoonne borne by nature to bee of greate worthynes, prayſe and free lyberalitee, by whome euerye manne maye perceaue muche god lynes, whyche helpeth hys father nowe beynge in thraldome and captiuitee as muche as in hym lyeth. And as for kynge Edwarde, he is a man full of contumelye, and ingratytude, geuen all to pleaſure, euell wyllynge to take anye paynes, and promotynge rather theim that come of nought, than noble and auncient men. Wherefore I thyncke it wyll come to paſſe ſhortlye, that eyther he wyll deſtroye all nobilitee, or elles nobilitee deſtroye him But before al other, we ſhulde fyrſte enterpriſe to reuenge oure cauſe whych haue fyrſte taken hurt at hys handes. For he (as I am ſure you knowe it bothe) after that he was kynge dyd fyrſte pryuelye gooe aboute to defyle oure dygnitee, and then after dyd openly intende our confuſyon and loſſe of honoure, as thoughe he was not broughte to that dygnitee by vs, and not we by hym, and therfore euen now of late when I went ambaſſadour to Fraunce I was had in no regard, whereby the eſtimation whiche all kynges haue conceaued of vs, partely gotten by our auncetours, &amp; partly by our owne trauailes &amp; peines, ſhal nowe be extynguiſhed

vtterly, &amp; nothinge ſette by. And by theſe ꝑſuacions he wonne his brother ye archebiſhoppe his hert, &amp; brought him to be of his minde, but he could not ſo ſone nor eaſelye perſuade the Lorde Marques, for at yt firſt he would by no meanes be moued to worke treaſon at any hād againſt kyng Edward, but at the laſt whē the earle had promyſed him the helpe &amp; powre of many noble prynces he was cōtented to kepe warre. The which Marques as he was vnwilling to conſent to this at yt fyrſt, ſo dyd he at the time of warre holde more of king Edwardes ſide thē king Henryes, as it ſhal appere more plain hereafter, the which was both deſtruccion to him, &amp; his .ii. brethren. After this ye earle of Warwike a man of greate wytte perceauing George the duke of Clarēce, brother to kīg Edward, to beare no great good wyl toward his brother yt king, what ſo euer the matter was, firſt to proue hym and to knowe his minde, begāne to complain a lytle of the king his doinges, then after that the duke was in the ſame tale wyth hym again, &amp; ſhewed him alſo what iniuries he had taken at his brothers hand: he beyng ſomwhat bolder to ſpeake, brake his mynde more at large deſiring him to folow his coūcel, &amp; that he ſhould not think this to be done of any raſhnes, ſhewed hym how warely through his pollicie all his matters were wroughte, &amp; deſired him, yt he would caſt wt him ſelfe how to bring ſuch a weyghtie matter to paſſe, wherby al thinges may be prouided before hand, to whom after many great promiſes, he offered his daughter then of ripe age, to be maried to him, The duke throughe the councell and greate

deſieryng of therle of Warwike was contented to dooe all thynges as he would haue hym. After yt therle had this communicacion with the duke, he purpoſed to goo to Caleis, of the whiche toune he was then chief capitain, and wher his wife and doughters wer then inhabityng, but to thend that this ſedicion might bee the ſoner begonne, where with all Englād was ſore troubled a greate tyme, he had apoin
                        •
                     ted that ſone after he was gone to Caleis his brother tharchebiſhop, &amp; the lord marques ſhould make an inſurreccion in Yorke, wherby the battaill might bee begonne while he was ſo farre frome theim.
                  When all theſe thynges were prepared for, and his counſaill well alowed and taken, he went ſtreight with yt duke of Clarence to Caleys. And ther after that the duke had promiſed by an othe that he would euer bee true, he maried lady Iſabell the erles eldeſt doughter, yt whiche whē it was dooen, thei bothe conſulted together yt more ſpedily, for yt yt inſurreccion was made in Yorke as it was commaunded and appoincted. The whiche cōpaignie begōne firſt to ſpoile with out all mercie or reſpect of any thyng. For ther was at Yorke an old and a riche hoſpitall of ſainct Leonard, where the poore and impotent perſones wer harboured, &amp; the ſicke menne comforted, and this hous was founde of yt charitee of the coūtree, whiche did geue yerely certain of wheate, as yt firſt fruites of all their corne to the ſuſtenaunce and mainteynyng of theim, to the whiche noumbre of grayne certain houſband menne of the countree did refuſe to gyue any part through the counſaill of therle of Warwikes compaignie,

ſaiyng plainly that the poore and ſickely people had it not, but thei that had yt rule and gouernaunce of the hous, and after that the procters of the hoſpitall claimyng it as dewe vnto theim, ſought for their right. And for that cauſe greate tumulte was and muche conſpiracie made, ſo that within fewe dayes, there was gathered aboute a fiftene thouſand, whiche compaignie came towardes Yorke. But after yt it was knowne in the citee that ſuche a compaignie of menne had riſen, the citizens watchyng euer for feare, was in doubte whether thei ſhould mete theim and trie it in open felde, or tary in the citee and kepe theim frome the walles.

The people beyng nothyng abaſhed at the death of their capitain, but rather the more eger &amp; fearce, conſideryng that thei could not ouercome Yorke, without ordinaunce whiche thei lacked, wēt ſtreight forth to London. And as for that the lord marques putte to death yt duke and capitain of yt cōmons, beyng alſo one of his cōſpiracie, did it for this intent, that either he would not bee aknowen faultie of this cōmocion, or els that he had vtterly determined to holde with kyng Edward, of whom as it dooeth after appere, he did get perfect amitie but after the kyng knewe the mynd and purpoſe

The Yorkeſhire menne beyng glad of this victorie, wer ſtreight couled &amp; went no ferder, but hauyng their handes full of ſpoyles &amp; prayes went backe ward again, lookyng when the erle of Warwike would come, the whiche ſhortely after came from Calais with the duke of Clarence his ſoonne in lawe to the hooſt, &amp; commēdyng highly the capitaines, and reioiſyng gladly that thei had ye victorie, did ſpedyly prepare an other armie.

Therle of Warwike went to his chief toune with all his hooſt, and there within twoo dayes cauſed therle of Pēbruch with certain other ſtates taken at yt tyme, to bee behedded. In the meane ſeaſon there begonne awaie to bee foūd for peace, for the whiche, letters wer wrytten too and fro, &amp; herauldes ſent from the kyng to therle, and frome the erle to the kyng again, wherby the kyng truſtyng verely that all was pacified, was leſſe ware of hym ſelf, and feared leſſe his aduerſaries, the whiche thyng when it was knowen, and ſhewed to the erle by certain ſpies: he went furth in a night as priuely as he could with a ſtrong power to the kyng his tentes, &amp; ther killyng theim yt kepte watche, tooke the kyng vnware, &amp; brought hym to Warwike, and to the entent the kyng his frendes might not knowe wher he was, conueighed hym priuely from thens in the night to a toune in Yorkeſhire called Middelame, and there to bee kepte faſt in hold. But yet the kyng could bee in

And yet neuertheleſſe thei lette hym goo when he was in holde, &amp; when kyng Edward was deliuered, he went ſtreight to Yorke, and there beyng honorably receiued of his citezens, taried for the ſpace of twoo dayes to gette hym an hooſt of menne, but when he could not haue a worthy compaignie, conſideryng yt he ſhould goo to London emong the middeſt of his hooſt, went frome Yorke to Lancaſtre, &amp; there found Wyllyam Haſtynges lord chamberlain, of whō he hauyng greate helpe came ſafe to Lōdon. But therle of Warwike and the duke, after thei had perceiued kyng Edward to bee deliuered throughe the meanes of falſe trai tours, &amp; that all thynges that thei had appoincted was to none effecte, was greately moued with anger and ſorowe, and by and by callyng together

By this greate entreatyng of noble menne therle and the kyng gyuyng feyth one to an other peace was had for a tyme, wherein the erle and

the duke went bothe to London with a ſmall compaignie of menne in compariſon to the daunger that thei wer in, and at Weſtminſter was with the kyng for the reformacion and ſtabliſhyng of all thynges and for peace to bee had, wher the kyng and thei beeyng at greate woordes, nothyng was determyned or ended.

Then the kyng callyng Rychard to hym, warned hym to byd his brother Robert that he ſhould leaue of warre, and goo frome the erle, and in the meane ſeaſon the kyng went foreward wt his hooſt againſt his enemies, bryngyng with hym this foreſaid Rychard &amp; Thomas, and beeyng but frome Stamforde wher his enemies did lie the ſpace of twoo dayes iourney, was informed yt Robert kepte yt armie ſtill, nothyng moued with yt letters of his fathers wrytyng, for the whiche the kyng beyng ſore greued, cauſed bothe Rychard and Thomas euen there cōtrarie to his promiſe, mooſt ſhamefully to haue their heddes chopped of.

And in this battaill ther was kylled as mēne reported tenne thouſand menne. The erle at this tyme beeyng at his owne toune of Warwike, and commyng ſhortely to his

And yt kyng meruailyng greatlye at yt noble actes that yt erle had doen, was mynded thorowly to helpe hym in all yt he could, &amp; when he knewe yt he was lāded in Fraūce, was glad of it, &amp; ſent to hym certayn of his nobles, to ſhewe hym that he did wiſhe to haue

                  This was yt .ix. yere of kyng Edwardes reigne The .ix. yere. when the erle fled to Fraunce, and of our Lorde a M .CCCC. and .lxxx. But this greued kyng Edward that thei wer fled, for becauſe many of ye people and cōmunaltee was deſyrous to ſee hym, and thought that the ſonne had been goone from theim and out of this worlde, when he was abſent. And in ſuche eſtimaciō and honour was he had of the people, yt thei worſhipped &amp; honoured none but hym, or at the leaſt none more then hym. In ſo muche yt his only name was euery mannes ſong &amp; voyce, eſpecially of the cōmē people when they made triumphe abrode in yt ſtretes. Wherby, the moſte parte helde of the earle his ſyde, and bare hym more fauoure in theyr hartes then kyng Edward. Wherby ye kyng was in feare and daunger both of his owne countremen yt wer in his realme, and of theim that were abrode in Fraunce, but before all other he did prouide for yt erle his cōmyng. And firſt he ſente to Charles the duke of Burgom his brother in law deſiryng him yt he would manaſhe Lewes the kyng, wt whom he had made a league of peace, not to aide the erle of Warkwike or yt duke his ſonne in lawe, neither wt mony nor with mē. The which Charles wrote to yt kyng of Fraūce, &amp; thretened hym many thynges, if ſo that he mainteyned or helped theim. And when the kyng of Fraūce had red his letter, aūſwered again

&amp; ſaied yt he might lawfully &amp; would ſauyng his league &amp; truce, helpe his frēds yt wer valiaūt &amp; noble men as the earle was, and ſettyng nothyng by all his thretenyng &amp; braggyng wordes, ſayd it ſhoulde bee neither greate peyne nor coſte to hym. Whē theſe tydynges came into England, yt kyng was veraye ſorie, &amp; for that cauſe ſearched priuely in his realme, who wer frēdes to his enemies. And for feare by yt reaſon of the examinaciō of theim yt wer priſoners &amp; in his hand, ſome did take ſentuarie, and ſome came to ye kynges ſide. And emonges theim the lord Marques Montacute offered hymſelf to the kyng again, to helpe hym in his warres, whom the kyng gladly receaued, for becauſe that by him mo would leane to his ſide. In this meane ſeaſon ye erle of Warwike &amp; the duke went to Ambaſſy, wher the kyng of Fraūce was, &amp; by the way the people came veraye thicke to ſee hym, becauſe they harde ſo muche ſpeakyng of his nobleneſſe, &amp; when he came there, the kyng receaued hym moſte gently, to whō ſhortly after the erle did breake his mynd, and ſhewed the cauſe of his commyng. To whome the kyng promyſed all that he coulde dooe for hym to the vttermoſte extente of his power. Sone after quene Margarete the wife of Henrye yt .vi. came to theim, with her ſōne prince Edward and the earle of Penbruck, and alſo of Oxēforde the whiche a lytle before ſayled ouer to her. After they cōmuned together, as concernyng yt ſafegard of their bodies, a league was made thorowe the kyng of Fraunce his counſel. And firſt lady Anne the doughter of the earle was maried and deſpouſed to prynce Edwarde the quenes ſoonne.

Alſo the erle and the duke promyſed faithfullye yt they woulde not geue ouer, vnto ſuche tyme that kyng Henrye the .vi. or Edwarde his ſoonne were proclaymed kyng of Englande, &amp; after kyng Henry, that the erle and the duke ſhould ouerſee and gouerne the realme by the wyll and apoyntmente of the quene Margarete and her ſonne prince Edwarde, vnto ſuche tyme that the forenamed prince wer of lawfull age and habilitee, the whiche they promyſed faythfully to obſerue and dooe as they wer apoynted. And beſydes theſe, many other condicions were made, aſwel for that reaſon did ſo require, as the buſynes yt was at that tyme. When this league of truth &amp; faithfulnes was thus made the kyng Lewes holpe the erle with mēne, harnes and nauie, that he might the ſurer go to Englāde. And Rhenate alſo the father of y• quene Margarete, gaue hym mēne &amp; harnyſe to his power. So that he hauyng no ſmall nombre of men, did take ſhippe at Sayne mouth &amp; ther tariyng, hard word from Englād by letters, that he ſhould come ouer in all the haſte, &amp; that there were ſo many yt would take his parte, yt he ſhoulde haue no nede to bryng any with hym, for they wer redy in harneyſe at the water ſide, willyng to helpe hym in al yt they could and not they onely, but many noble men &amp; princes would helpe hym both wt mony, men &amp; harneyſe, &amp; with all yt they could dooe. When he had receaued theſe letters, he purpoſed to go forth, and take the oportunitee of the tyme. And becauſe that ye quene was not redy to ſet forth, he &amp; the duke of Oxēford and ye duke of Penbruch, went before wt parte of yt hoſte &amp; nauye, to trie what chaūce thei ſhuld haue,

that if all thinges ſhould chaunce well, the quene and the prynce ſhould folowe and come vnto Englande. Therfore the Earle and the Duke thanking the king as highly as they coulde for that he had doone ſo much for theim, dyd take their leaue and ſayled vnto Englande with all their armie. Then the Duke of Burgoyne not contented that the earle ſhoulde bee holpen of the king of Fraūce agaynſt king Edward, prepared a great nauye of ſhippes aboute the coſtes of Normandye, that he might take hym cōming towardes Englande, yet neuertheleſſe the Earle eſcaped all daungers, and landed ſafe he and all his menne at Dartmouth, frome the whiche place he ſayled to Fraunce halfe a yere before.
                  After that the Earle came to lande, he made a proclamacion in king Henry the .vi. name, that all they that were of lawfull age ſhoulde make battayle agaynſt Edwarde duke of Yorke whiche agaynſte all ryghte and lawe at that tyme had the crowne. The whiche when it was doon, it cannot be ſpoken howe ſoone it went aboute all ye realme that he was come and had made this proclamacy on, at the whiche alſo is not to be expreſſed howe many thouſandes of menne came to hym. The Earle hauing all this power &amp; greate armie went ſtreyght to London, whome when Edwarde perceyued to drawe nighe, he fledde for the tyme, truſtyng to haue hym at ſome vauntage, but at the laſte he was dryuen to that ende, that he had no mynde to get any hoſte to reſyſt his enemies, but beyng in greate daunger of his owne lyfe, fled wt the duke of Glouceſtre his brother, vnto a towne

M .iiii. C. foure ſcore and one, that kyng Henry beganne to reigne. So that king Henry ſo often vanquyſhed began to reigne nowe, likely ſhortely after to faule againe. The which fortune chaunſed to hym by many mennes opinions, becauſe he was a very ſimple and innocent man, and yt he had rather in godlineſſe &amp; vertue excell other, then in honoure and rule, ſo yt for the loue yt he had to religion, he loked for no dignitee or honoure, whiche chaunſeth to fewe that wil not ſeke for it or regard &amp; kepe it when they haue it. But his enemies ſaide he was a coward, &amp; had

not the herte or manlyneſſe to bee a kyng or meete for that offyce. So that who ſoeuer deſpiſeth that the cōmune people alloweth &amp; maruaileth at, is accompted for a mad man, contrariwyſe, he yt doeth agree to theim and in their tale, he is a wiſe man, where in dede ſuche wiſdom (as it is comēly ſaide) is fooliſhneſſe before God. Alſo ſome ſaide, it was the will of God yt it ſhould ſo bee, for his graundfather Henry the fourth gotte it by violencye and force of armes, ſo yt it coulde not bee longe enioyed of hym, but that faute of the graundeſire did redounde on the nephewes. But nowe to yt matter.
                  After this king Henry held his parlyament at Weſtmynſter, the .xxvi. daye of Nouembre, in the whiche Edwarde is declared openly tray toure to his coūtree, bycauſe he had taken yt crowne to him and all his goodes geuen away, &amp; in like maner al theirs yt did take his parte, and ſo iudgement was geuen on theim to dye. Furthermore, all yt decrees ſtatutes and actes of yt forenamed Edward were broken &amp; of none effecte. And then yt earle of Warwike, as a man yt had deſerued much of his coūtre was made gouernoure ouer all yt realme, to whō he did take ye duke of Clarence as felowe to hym. So by yt meanes yt realme was brought to a new ſtate, cleane tranſformed &amp; altered. To this parliament came the lorde Marques Mountacute, the which excuſing his treaſon yt he did take kyng Edward his parte, &amp; ſaing it was for feare of death, had his pardone▪ Truely yf this man had taken kyng Edwardes part, &amp; had ſtand to his ſide manly, he had not been ſo ſore an enemie, and hurted ſo much his frendes, as he was being a falſe fained

and coloured frende, for thoſe thinges that we be ware of, and knewe before to bee pernicious, dooe leſſe hurte vs. But nowe quene Margarete being in Fraunce prayed euery daye from that time the Earle went into England, for the victorie, the whiche when ſhe knewe was obteined by the king his letters that came to her, ſhortely after did take ſhyppe, towardes England, but thorowe yt ſharpneſſe of the wether and greate tempeſtes ſhe was conſtrayned to lande, and to differre her iourney to an other tyme. At the ſame tyme Gaſpar the earle of Penbruch went to Wales to his Earledome, where he founde lorde Henry the Earle of Richemonde his brothers ſonne, a chylde of ten yere olde, &amp; there kepte pryſoner, but lyke a noble man of ye erle willyam Harberte his wyfe, whome we ſpake of before, that Edwarde had made hym erle, and then after taken in batayl was behedded at the cōmaundement of the earle of Warwike.

And nowe Edwarde althoughe he was oute of his countree, yet dyd he not dyſpayre but that he ſhulde haue mattre and redy occaſion to recouer his kingdome, for the duke of Burgoyne partlye had promiſed hym both greate ayde and ſocoure, and partly the priuy frendes that he had in Englande dyd councell hym by letters ſente from tyme to time, yt he would haſten his iournay homward, and incontin
                        •
                     tly after, very many fled to hym oute of Englande, eyther for feare of the lawes, that they had offended, or elles for ſorowe that the worlde was ſo turned, that they could not haue theyr wyll, as they had before, in accomplyſhynge theyr couetouſe myndes and deſyres, and cauſed hym to make the more haſte homewarde. And kynge Edwarde beynge rauiſhed with their golden promiſes, thoughte nothyng more payneful or wretched, then to tary one daye lenger, and nothyng more pleaſaunt thē to go of his iourney,

and ſo takynge no moo wyth them then two thou ſande harneſed menne, at the ſprynge of the yeare ſayled into Englande, landynge in the coaſtes of Yorkeſhyre at an hauen towne called Rauinſport And there ſettynge for the all hys menne, dyd reaſon wyth hys captaynes and conſulte, to what place they ſhoulde fyrſte goo. For it was ieoperdious conſydering the ſmall companie that he had, to take anye waye for the. But after longe delyberation, they were all agryed that ſome certayne knightes and horſemen of that ſmal compaignie ſhuld bee ſent one to euerie quarter to the townes that wer nyghe, to the intente that they myghte drawe the hartes &amp; myndes of the people to king Edwardes ſyde. But it is not lykelye that kynge Edwarde beyng a wyſe manne durſt be bolde, or would in any wyſe come into England, with ſuch a ſmall power, excepte he had knowen ſurely that he ſhould haue had great helpe at hys commyng the whych is a plain token, that the duke of Clarence, and the lorde Marques, had procured hys fauoure, promyſinge him all their helpe that they coulde make, for the tryall of the whych, ther was manifeſt tokens, that dyſcloſed and bewrayed all their falſhed. For they priuilie wēt about to know mennes mindes and to what parte they would declyne and the nexte day after came to kinge Edwarde, and ſhewed him that the common people dyd ſtande ſtiflye of kynge Henrye his ſyde, and woulde defende hys quarell as ryghte and iuſte at al times, and that they had nomore nede nowe to make anye tumulte, in ſo much, that no manne would (althoughe eftſons deſired and prayed,) go

to king Edward, yea, and that noman woulde for feare of the earle of Warwike, heare anye thinge ſpoken of that matter, whoſe myndes after that kinge Edwarde had throughlye ſerched and knowen, he chaunged his mynd and purpoſe, &amp; wher as before he claymed the crowne, then he publyrſhed abrode that he woulde haue but hys ryghte that was his landes, and heritage of Yorke ſhyre. And 
                        •
                     t that worde, it cannot be well ſpoken, howe redily mē wer willinge to helpe him, conſideringe that he claymed nothinge but hys ryghte, in ſomuch, y• very pytie dyd moue manye, althoughe they woulde not helpe hym, yet at no hande to reſyſte him. And kynge Edwarde reconſilyng him ſelfe to the common people by theſe meanes, toke hys iournye towarde Yorke, and wente to Beuer lay. The earle then beinge at Warwik, after that he knew yt king Edward was landed about York ſtreyght ſent a poſt to his brother lord Mōtacute then liyng that winter at Pomfreit wt a great army, to ſhewe him what daunger mighte enſue, yf king Edward got yt towne of york, &amp; bed theim yf his enemies drewe nigh, ether to mete with thē in plain felde, or elles to bete theim from the towne, vnto ſuch tyme, that he came wyth a greater hoſt which he prepared then, in all the haſt he coulde. And becauſe he knew not ſurely which way his enemies wolde come, he fyrſt ſent to euery towne in york ſhyre, and to yorke it ſelfe certayne poſtes, to bid euery man be in his harneſſe ready, and that yt citezins ſhould ſhut the gates ſurelye that kynge Edward myght haue no acceſſe. In the meane tyme king Edward came peaceably, and wythoute

the reſiſtaunce of anye man towardes the towne of Yorke, of whoſe commyng when the citezens were certified, they made ſure the gates, and ſtandynge in harneſſe, for the defence of it, dyd ſende twoo of the aldermen, to warne the kyng the comming nyghe, that he dooe not enterpryſe to farre, or put hym ſelfe in ieopardie, for they were mynded to dryue him and all hys awaye, wyth all the power they myghte. When Edwarde had heard theyr myndes, he was in ſo greate feare &amp; agonie that he could not tell what to dooe, for yf he ſhuld haue goone back, he feared that the common people as men gredye of a praye, woulde perſue him and yf he ſhould goo forth, he was in daunger of the Yorke ſhyre men, leaſte they ſhoulde ſodenlye faull vpon hym, and take hym: and therefore, ſeeyng that he was not able to match them in battayle, thought to mollyfie theim with fayre wordes, and ſo beganne to entreat after the moſt lowlye and gentle maner the meſſaungers, that they woulde in hys name ſhewe the cytezyns, that he came not to clayme the crowne, but hys herytage and ryghte of Yorke ſhyre, and therfore that they woulde helpe theyr lorde and duke of Yorke, and yf that he myghte be receaued through theyr meanes, he wolde requyte theyr kindenes, and remember theyr benifyte as longe as he lyued. And by ſuche fayre ſpeaking and flatterie, he dimiſſed thē and folowed ſtraighte after to the gates with his companie. The citezins beynge ſomwhat moued wyth thys anſwer, for that he entended no harme agaynſt kyng Henrie, they ſpake wyth hym from the wall, and badde hym to go frome thence, and

if he would go quickely, he ſhould take no harme. But he ſpeakyng veraye gentely to euerye one of theim, &amp; callyng ſome by name, mooſt gentely did deſire theim yt he might come into his owne toune And ſo paſſyng all the daye in that cōmunicacion, at yt length the citezens partely ouer come wt his mooſt gētle ſpeakyng, &amp; large promiſes made, fell to this poincte, yt if Edward would ſwere to handle his citezens after a gentle ſorte, &amp; hereafter bee obedient to kyng Henry his cōmaundement, thei would receiue hym in to yt citee, and helpe hym wt all yt power that thei might. Edward beyng glad to here this, the next daye after early, a maſſe was ſaid at ye gates, wher he receiuyng the ſacrament, promiſed feithfully vpon his othe yt he would obſerue bothe the thyngēs afore named, &amp; ſo was receiued in to the citee. Neuertheleſſe, it was ſo ferre vnlike that he would obſerue one of theim, that he minded none other thyng then yt he might depriue the kyng of his croune, as here after ſhall appere more euidēt. So yt oftē tymes we ſe noble men, aſwell as the laye people thorowe ambicion &amp; filthy couetouſnes, thei forgettyng god &amp; all godlynes dooe ſwere greate othes in promiſyng thynges, ye whiche entendyng before thei make their othe, to breake it ſhortely after. Yet ſuche perſons oftymes haue their rewardes of God at one or other tyme as this Edward had, ſo that ſome tyme the puniſhment falleth on the nephewes, for the offence that the vncle had cōmitted. But of this thyng I will ſpeake more in Rychard the third, in a place wher a manne maye ſee that ye progenie of Edward wer puniſhed for this offence, when Edward had thus

framed his matters, he forgettyng ye othe yt he had made, did ſe yt the citee was ſtrōgly kepte, and gettyng hym an army together thought he wold not lynger his buſines bycauſe he harde his enemies made no greate preparaūce or haſte, but tooke his iourney towarde London, &amp; in his goyng did purpoſely goo out of his waye yt led hym to Pomfret wher ye lord marques was, &amp; toke on yt right hand within leſſe thē .iiii. miles of his enemies. And whē he perceiued yt thei made no ſkyrmiſhe nor mocion came in to the right waie again when he was paſt theim, &amp; wēt to Notynghame. But this greued the Yorke ſhire mēne that he ſhould deceiue theim ſo vnhoneſtly &amp; otherwiſe then did become a kyng, or noble manne. After that it was knowen that kyng Edward came wt out all daunger of his enemies, to Notyngham, then came there to hym many noble mēne, vpon this conſideracion yt the lord Moū
                     tacute either would not entre vpō his enemies as though he had agreed with theim, or els durſt not come out of his tentes, for that he was not able to matche wt theim. Therfore menne thought better to take Edwardes part, conſideryng yt his power was ſo greate, then to hold with kyng Henry and hee in daunger of their liues, and loſſe of all their goodes &amp; landes. Edward reioyſyng at this, went to Leceſtre, &amp; hearyng that therle was at his toune of Warwicke &amp; therle of Oxenford with hym, hauyng a greate armie, and that thei bothe entended to bryng hym to theim, preuentyng their purpoſe wet awaye wt his hooſt, either wyllyng to fight, or els ioyne in frendeſhip and loue with his brother duke of Clarence, with whome then commyng frō
                     
London wt an hooſt of mēne he thought to ſpeake before yt he came to therle &amp; his cōpaignie, fearyng leſte yt he would not ſtand to yt promiſe yt he made, for yt he was variable &amp; incōſtāt. In ye meane tyme therle of Warwike was very heuie &amp; ſore moued wt ye lord marques becauſe he would neither kepe the kyng from Yorke as he was bed, nor yet when thei came before his noſe, would not proffer theim ones to fight, &amp; therfore cōſideryng yt his enemies multiplied more &amp; more, in his gooyng towardes hym made an hooſt, &amp; ſent for yt duke of Clarence to come to hym, then hauyng an hooſt at London. Whō whē he perceiued to linger, &amp; as a man doubtyng whether he ſhould kepe battaill or peace, to haue no mind of ſettyng forth his mē, miſtruſting alſo yt he was by ſome traine allured to folowe his brethren and take their partes, tooke his waye to Couētrie, to thende that there he might meete his enemies. Then Edward came to Warwike, and frome thens to the erle, and pitched his tentes by hym, and the next daie after bad battaill to therle, the whiche erle durſt not come oute, for feare that the duke of Clarence whome he thought had deceaued hym, which duke in deede came, as it was ſhewed after with a greate power of menne. The whiche when Edward perceaued, he made towardes hym, &amp; that it ſhould not bee thought to bee a made guyle, ſette his hooſt in araye as though he would fight, and ſo did the duke. But when thei came in ſight, Richard duke of Glouceſtre as one that ſhould take vp this matter, firſte ſpake with the duke priuely in his eare, and then came to Edward and did the ſame to hym, and at the laſte

peace was proclaimed, wherby euery manne puttyng doune their weapons, Edward &amp; his brethrē enbraced louyngly one an other. After this Edward made it bee proclaimed that yt duke with all theim that came with hym, ſhould bee perpetuall frendes, &amp; that thei three ſhould loue like thre brethren as thei wer in brotherly loue for euer. Neuer theleſſe God dooeth not ſeme to haue forgiuē this Edward his offēce of periury, although euē nowe fortune fauored hym, for yer it were long he was again vexed wt werre, beſide yt plage &amp; diſtruciō of his children after his death. When thei wer thus come together, thei minded to proue if yt erle wold come to theim alſo &amp; hold wt theim, to whō ye duke of Clarēce ſēt certain of his frendes, yt whiche firſt ſhuld excuſe yt he had done, &amp; thē deſire hym if yt he would to bee at one with kyng Edward. Whoſe mynde whē therle heard, he vtterly deteſted hym, &amp; with muche curſyng cryed oute of hym yt he had contrary to his feith &amp; othe made, fled to kyng Edward. And to his cōmaūdemēt &amp; biddyng yt he ſēt, he made none other aunſwer but this that he had rather bee like hym ſelf, thē like a falſe &amp; periured duke. So yt he appoincted vtterly neuer to leaue battaill, before that either he wer killed and ded or his enemies ouercomed. After this, Edward hauyng ſuche a ſtrong power of mēne went boldely to London, wher after that it was knowen that the duke of Clarence had taken his parte, and that all the brethren were come in to one knot, the citezens were in ſuche a feare, that thei could not tell what to dooe, but at the lengthe they were dryuen for feare to take kyng Edward his parte

At theſame tyme there came letters from the earle to kyng Henry, to yt duke of Somerſet, to yt archbyſhop of Yorke, and other of the kyng his counſel, yt they ſhould kepe the citee from their enemies handes for the ſpace of .ij. or .iij. dayes, &amp; he would come ſtreyght with a great armye of mēne. They defended the citee as ſtrongely as they coulde, but it was to no purpoſe, for the citezens cōſyderyng ye kyng Henry was no greate warryer, and yt he had but ſmall policie in the feates of theſame, and contrary wiſe, that kyng Edwarde was a man that of hym ſelfe coulde rule a realme maruelous well, and ſuche a man that woulde not onelye preſerue hym ſelfe and all his, but alſo defende theim from all maner of iniuryes and harmes that ſhoulde chaunce, thought beſt to leane on his ſyde. And at his commyng to London, the people coulde by no thretenyng or ſtrayt cōmaundement, be otherwyſe kepte backe, but that they would mete hym then comyng, &amp; ſalute hym altogether as kyng &amp; ruler of the realme. At whoſe commynge in, the duke of Somerſet and certayn other fled away, and made the beſte ſhifte euery manne for hym ſelfe that he could, to eſcape his hādes, ſauyng that kyng Hē
                     ry taryed poſte alone in the biſhoppes paleyce beſyde Powles, where ſtandynge lyke a deſperate manne, and not knowynge what to dooe was taken of kyng Edward, and caſt into pryſon agayn in the towre.
                  This Edward came into London the .xi. day of Apryll, halfe a yere after that he hadde ſayled into Flaunders, and callyng his councel together, did highly commende the citezens, for yt faythfulneſſe

that they bare to hym, and in eſpeciall the Aldermen, yt they cauſed the people to do their obeyſaūce to hym, &amp; alſo ſharpelye rebuked other of the cytie whom he knewe to haue lent monye to kyng Henry. And for yt cauſe woulde haue made theim paye mony to the preparyng of an hoſte for hym, but at the laſt he bad, theim bee without all feare, promyſyng theim their pardon &amp; ſafetie of life, thorowe the whiche gentleneſſe, he gatte the fauoure of the cōmen people wonderfully. The erle conſideryng that battayll ſhould be ſhortelye, folowed his enemyes in great haſte, to the entente that yf his enemies had any ſtoppe or lette by yt waye, he myght fight &amp; buckel with theim, before they came to Lō
                     dō. But now after that he had purſued theim long and came a good waye of his iourney, worde was brought yt Edwarde had gottē London &amp; impriſoned the kyng. The earle then perceauyng that the victorie &amp; ende of fightyng ſhould be tryed in this one batayle, reſted at ſaynt Albones, partely to refreſhe his men, and partely to take ſome counſayl. In this hoſte there was the duke of Exceſter, the earle of Oxenforde, the duke of Somerſet and the lorde Mountacute Marques, brother to the earle whom the earle perceaued to bee very vnwyllyng to fight, and that agaynſt kyng Edward, and therfore he had no truſt to hym, yet the loue yt betwixte brother and brother diminiſhed the ſuſpicion, but whatſoeuer he thought eyther of hym or of other, he hymſelfe was euer out of feare and daunger. And ſo came from ſaynt Albones, to a toune that is halfe waye betwyxte London and that, aboute a tenne myle frome London, called Barnet, and

this toune ſtandeth on a hyll, where there is a goodlye playne, and here the earle entended to pitche his battayle. And Edward hearyng of this prepared his armye, and adioyned a greate power of young menne to theim, and ſo with bowes, bylles, ſpeares and arowes, and all maner inſtrumentes apperteynyng to warre, he had ſo furnyſſhed his menne, that he thought to make riddaūce of theim at that tyme for all, and fyniſhe battayle that was ſo longe holden. And ſo came with this his armye to mete his enemies, and that he might bee the redier to fight with theim whereſoeuer he mette theim, he had foure wynges, that they could eſcape hym at no hand. And he brought with hym to battayle alſo Henry then priſoner, to the entente that his aduerſaries might bee the more diſcouraged at the ſight of hym, or els, if fortune fauoured hym not, he might neuertheleſſe bee ſaued by him. After the noone, he pytched his tentes at the fore named Barnet nighe to hys enemyes, but that he myghte not fyghte that daye, he defended hys tentes veraye ſtrongelye, for the longer he taryed the better it was, by reaſon of the daylye concourſe of noble men and commen people to hym, and the woorſe for the earle, for that he was farre from his frendes.
                  There they lodged that night, and by breake of day ye earle of Warwike begā to araye his armye of this ſorte. Fyrſte the lorde Marques and the earle of Oxenforde was ſet on the lefte ſyde wyth certayn horſſemen, and he hymſelfe with the duke of Exceter on the ryght ſyde. In the myddeſte betwixte

theim bothe he ſetteth the duke of Somerſet with all the archers. And thus araiyng theim to this battayl, beganne to exhorte theim, that thei would fight luſtely and lyke hardye meune, reuengyng the quarell of their countree, for that he had moſte falſely poſſeſſed yt croune. In like maner did kyng Edward, whiche after that he had ſet theim in ordre, encouraged theim to fight lykewyſe, and to remembre that thei inuaded rebelles, traytours and ſedicious perſons, whiche entended nothynge but the vtter deſtruccion and loſſe of theyr countree. When daye came, the trompettes beganne to blowe on bothe ſydes, as the tokens and lignes of the battayle. And firſte the bowe men ſhot, &amp; then drawynge nere tryed it with ſweorde. Edwarde truſtyng thorowe the multitude of his mē to haue the better hād did ſtāde ſtiffely to theim, enbouldenyng his ſouldiours in all that he coulde. Whoſe power the erle moſte manfully reſiſted. And ſo by long cōtinuaunce of battail, many men wer ſlayne in whoſe places ſucceded euer freſher &amp; freſher. At the length the erle perceauyng his mē to bee ouerthrowen by the kyng his great power, drewe nigh with his foreward, &amp; conſtreyned the kyng to geue backe a litle. Then Edward ſeeyng that, brought freſhe men to aide ye other, ſo that thother mē wer beten downe very ſore to ye groūde. And Edwarde beeyng werye of this longe fyghtynge (for they fought from mornyng to none) cauſed theim that wer without the battayl, then ſtandyng for the defēce of Edward, yf ſuch nede ſhould be, to fall vpō their enemies, &amp; beare theim downe wt their great power. The erle then ſeyng freſhe mē to come vpō
                     
theim, was nothing afeard, but truſting &amp; loking ſurely for the victorye, dyd comforte &amp; encourage his menne then almoſte diſcomfited, mooſt manfully, deſiring theim to beare oute this laſte brunt luſtely, and the victorie ſhould redounde to theim but they being weryed with longe continuaunce, were nothing moued at his wordes. Then he him ſelf moſte valiauntly came among the myddeſt of his enemyes, and there kylled and ſlewe many of theim, where he hym ſelfe at the laſte was ſtriken downe and his brother lorde Marques then folowing hym, after whoſe deathe all the other fled, &amp; ſo were taken moſte parte of theim. And this was the ende of the earle, whoſe ſtouteneſſe of ſtomack made hym bee in lyke peryll and leopardye at many other times at dyuerſe and ſundrye ſuche conflictes and warres. There was killed of both partes more then ten thouſande menne, and ſo many taken priſoners that they could not be noumbred. The duke of Somerſet, and the earle of Oxforde entendyng to take their waye to Scotlande, dyd chaunge their mindes, bicauſe it was ſo farre frō theim, and fledde ſtreight to Wales to the earle of Penbrucke, and ſo euery man to ſaue their liues, fledde, ſome one way and ſome an other. The erle of Exeter ſkaping very hardely, tooke the ſentuarye at Weſtminſter, and there remayned. When Edward had gotte this victorye, he went to London after the mooſt triumphyng faſſion, hauyng Henry with hym as priſoner. The deed corps alſo of the earle and the lorde Marques were brought to Poules, and there laye for the ſpace of .ii. dayes that euery manne might ſee theim to bee deed, and

that no man after fainyng yt he was aliue, myght ſowe ſedicion againe in reuenging his quarel. Yet the kyng was not ſo glad at ye death of therle, but he was as ſory for the loſſe &amp; deſtruccion of yt lord Marques, whome he dyd eſteme and take for his great frende. After this, quene Margaret hearing yt Edward was come into Englande, &amp; had done much hurte in yt realme, purpoſed to come into England &amp; her ſoonne alſo prince Edward wt a great armye of choſen &amp; picked Frenchmen, &amp; ſo to land at Waimouth. But for yt greate tempeſt yt was on the ſee, ſhe could not come ſo ſoone as ſhe woulde. But after ſhe had landed, &amp; heard that kyng Edward had conquered all, &amp; her huſband to be takē priſoner as deſtitute of all his frendes, and that ye erle with his brother lord Marques was ſlaine in felde, and all their army diſcomfyted and ſlayne &amp; putte to f
                        •
                     ight, ſhe began like a piteful &amp; deſperate ladye, to mourne and lament the fate &amp; calamitee of her huſband, ye whiche ſhe did nowe ſee to haue chaūſed, and ſowith this great feare &amp; agonie ſhe was in that caſe that ſhe had rather dye then lyue The quene mighte haue thought yt this euell had chaunſed to her for the putting to death of ye duke of Glouceſtre, of whoſe deathe althoughe peraduēture ſhe was not giltie, yet ſhe offended, in that ſhe dyd not ſaue ſuche a good man. For yf he had liued and had the dominion of the publike weale, king Henry had neuer been in ſuche trouble. But nowe (to leaue of this) yt quene deſpering bothe of her owne life &amp; her ſōnes alſo, went therby to a monaſtery of the charterhouſe monkes at a place called Bewe lieu, in engliſhe called faire place, &amp; ther

taking ſentuarie, remained with her ſoonne. And when it was knowen, that ſhe was there in ſentuarie, there came to her the duke of Somerſet, &amp; his brother the erle of Deuonſhire, whiche man euen frome the beginnyng had taken the other parte, whoſe returning after redounded to his euell and deſtruccion, alſo the erle of Penbroke Ihon Wen locke, &amp; Ihon Longſtrother Capytaines and rulers of the Rhodes. The quene being in ſorowe &amp; miſerye, was ſomwhat comforted at the ſighte of her frendes, wt whome ſhe talked and ſhewed the cauſe yt ſhe came no rather, deſiryng theim to prouyde for the ſafegard of her ſoonne &amp; to helpe her nowe, and ye ſhe would if the wether ſerued goo to Fraunce againe and bryng wt her, god willing at a more better &amp; mature time a greater power of mē The duke began to putte her in good comforte &amp; would in any wiſe ye ſhe ſhould ſet her mind whole vpon batail, &amp; nowe to fight againſt Edward whē he was bothe vnprepared &amp; alſo not furnyſhed of men yt were hable to fight, conſidering ye great batell that he had wt therle of Warwike, in yt which his men were ſore hurted &amp; weryed all together, &amp; yt it myght be their chaūce now to haue yt better of hym, although he diſcōfyted therle &amp; his hoſte, for becauſe yt victorie turneth oftentymes from one to an other in a momēt &amp; ſhort ſpace. Furthermore he ſhewed her ye the moſt part of yt nobilyte bare theyr good mindes &amp; hertes to kyng Henry, &amp; if ſo bee yt ſhe would bee a capitaine as ſhe had bene in tyme paſſed, he promiſed her a great army of his owne coſtes and charges, and that he woulde make other noble menne to take her parte, and defende

her at all times. The Quene miſtruſting and fearing yet muche of her owne ſoonne, aunſwered &amp; ſaied that ſhe allowed his counſell well, yf ſo that ſhe only might bee in daunger, and not her ſonne And therfore fearing that when they fought moſt earneſtly for their countree, her ſoonne might bee deſtroied or caſte awaye, ſhe thought beſt either to putte of and differre the battayl to an other time, or elles to ſende her ſoonne into Fraunce, &amp; there to bee kepte vnto ſuche tyme ye they had ſome better ſucceſſe in their warres. And truely the mother was not withoute a cauſe ſo louing to her chylde; for that her owne huſbande was a priſoner and a captiue perſone, and therfore as one caſte awaye, ſo that nexte after hym, ſhe loued mooſte tenderly this her ſoonne. Alſo that they might goo yt more wiſely aboute their entente, the quene counſayled theim all to laye their heedes together, and caſte all the waies howe to conuey their buſineſſe, and then yf they would fight, ſhe promiſed theim both her helpe, and good councell. Then the Erle ſaied it was no nede to waſte any more wordes, for he &amp; all they woulde fight ſtoutely agaynſte their enemies, and therfore they woulde doo that with all their might and power, that they had determined and apointed vpon. So they all gathered their armye, euery manne for his parte, oute of his owne countree &amp; ſhire. The quene brought now in good hope of warre, ſaied wel be it, &amp; ſtreight went by yt councell of yt duke to Bathe, looking and tarieng there for the armye, but to what place ſo euer ſhe went, ſhe would be aknowen to none, to thentent yt her aduerſaries might not knowe, vnto ſuch time

that ſhe came wher ſhe woulde bee. Edward hearyng that the quene was come, and that the duke of Somerſet, had prepared an hooſt to ayde her, ſente certayne ſpies to viewe of what number the armye was. And when they had ſhewed hym the nomber (but yet not knowyng whether they wold goo) the kyng apoynted to mete them before they came to London. And gathering his armie went to Oxforde ſhyre, and there pytched hys tentes at Abyngton, encreaſinge hys nomber and army as much as he could. But perceauyng, that they wer at Bathe, and there taryed purpoſely to multyply and enlarge their company, came to Malebrydge xv. myles frome Bathe, &amp; ſo haſted to come to thē before they did go to Wales, as he ſuſpected, whether in dede thei entended, to the erle of Penbruck hauyng theyr a great bonde of men. From which toune of Bathe the quene fled, and frome thence to Bryſtowe, and wyllinge to goo by Glouceter, ſent ſpyes before to knowe, yf ſhe myght haue paſſage, to whome aunſwere was broughte that ſhe coulde not, nor that thei of the towne would by anye meanes geue her place, ſhe hearynge of that went from Briſtowe to Teukiſbury. And ther the duke pytched hys battayle, agaynſt the wyll and aduiſe of many other captaynes, whych counſayled hym to tarye the erle of Penbruches comyng. Where Edwarde dyd take the quene, and kylled or at the leaſt impryſoned euery one almooſt that came with her. And of the nobilitee, there was killed the earle of Deuonſhyre, Iohn Wenlock captayn of the Rhodes, and the brother of the duke of Somerſet, wyth manye other moo. And taken

priſoners, the quene Margaret, &amp; her ſōnne prince Edward, yt duke of Somerſet, yt lord of ſ. Ihons, &amp; more then .xx. knyghtes beſyde thē. And all theſe wer behedded .ii. dayes after in yt ſelfe ſame towne ſauyng only the quene Margaret and her ſoonne Edwarde. Shortelye after prynce Edwarde was brought before the kyng, and there aſked wherfor he did inuade hys realme, which anſwered boldly and ſayde, to recouer my kyngedome as heritage by my forefathers and progenie dew to me. At the which wordes, Edwarde ſayde nothyng, but thruſtyng hym from hys ſyght wyth hys hande, whō the duke of Clarence and Glouceter, and yt lorde Haſtynges dyd kyll mooſte cruelly at hys departyng. Hys mother the quene, was caryed to London pryſoner, and frō thence raunſomed was had to Fraunce, where ſhe lyued in perpetuall ſorowe and care, not ſo much for her ſelfe, or her huſband as for her onely ſonne Edwarde, whome both ſhe and Henry her huſband truſted ſhould lyue, and poſſeſſe ye croune. When kinge Edward had thus ouercome theim, he went to London, and ther for iii. dayes cauſed proceſſion to bee through euerye place after the mooſt ſolempne and deuoute faſſy on. And here was the laſt ciuile battaile that this king kept, which was the yere of our lord. M .iiii. C .lxxx. and .xi.
                  After that kynge Edwarde was returned backe after the ſubduynge of hys rebelles, one Fauconbrydge the Earle of Kente hys baſterde, a ſtoute harted manne, beynge admyrall of the ſea, that none ſhoulde paſſe betwixte Calyſſe and Douer, to ayde or ſocoure kynge Edwarde, by the appoyntemente

of the earle of Warwyke, then after dryuen to nede and pouertee, beganne to bee a pyrate and rouer in the ſeea. In ſo much that he had throughe his robberye and ſhamefull ſpoylynge gotte vnto hym a greate nauye of ſhyppes, and at the laſte, landed in Kente, and there getting to hym a greate multitude of Kentyſhemenne, wyth the aſſiſtence of theim and hys ryotouſe compaignye of ſhyppemenne, came to London, and ſayde wyth a lowde voyce, they woulde defende kynge Henrye, and reſtore hym to hys crowne. But the people and cytezyns of London perceauyng that quene Margarete was ouercome in battayle, woulde geue theim no paſſage, but wyth greate myghte and vyolence enforſed Fawconbrydge to geue backe, and to take ſhyppe, and kylled and toke pryſoners the better parte of his menne.
                  Shortely after, the ſame Fauconbridge landing vnware at Southampton, was taken and behedded. But to ſpeake of the earle of Penbrucke, whē he had knowne that the quene was taken at Tewkeſburye, where ſhe had waged battayle, then goynge of hys waye to her, turned backe agayne to Chepſtey. And there lamentyng greatly both his owne chaunce, &amp; alſo the euell fortune yt kinge Hē
                     ry had, dyd breath alitle &amp; deliberate wt him ſelfe, what wer beſt to be done. In the meane time king Edward ſēt one Roger Vaughā to take yt erle by ſome train or guile. But the erle certified of it, did take y• ſelf ſame mā &amp; hedded hī, ſo yt he was killed yt intended to kyll. From that place yt erle went to his toune Pēbrucke, wher he was beſiged of Thomas Morgan then ſēt frō the king, that he could

get oute by no meanes, but on the eyght daye one Dauid the brother of the forſayde Morgane his mooſt aſſured frende conueyed him awaye, which then went to a toune by the ſea ſyde called Tinby and there takynge ſhyppe into Fraunce w

                     th the lorde Henrye his nephewe, by the earle of Rychemonde his brother, by chaunce came to Britaine, and there ſhewing the duke the cauſe of hys comminge, committed him ſelfe wholy into his handes. The duke entertayned the earle and all his company, after yt moſt beſt maner that he could, &amp; made of theim as though they had bene hys brethren, promyſing to theim ſure paſſeporte &amp; ſaueconduite, ouer ani place that he had rule or gouernaunce of. Nowe kinge Edwarde, after that hys realme was pacified, and theſe great tumultes apeaced, he tooke his iourny into Rence, and there ſetting his iuſtices, cauſed inquiſicion and ſerche to be made of this buſines and inſurrection, by y• baſterd and his adherentes, for the which offence manye were put to death, and ſuffered execution mooſt ſharply, accordīg to their merites. And not longafter, to thentent yt king Edward myght bee out of al daūgers &amp; aſſaultes of his enemies Hēry yt was depriued not lōg before of his crowne, was alſo ſpoiled of his life, yt is, was killed. And as the report &amp; fame went, the duke of Glouceter was ſuſpected to haue done yt dede, which ſticked him wt a dagger. And when he was dead, his corps was brought vnreuerētly frō the towre, through yt ſtretes of yt citee vnto Poules, &amp; ther lay all yt daye &amp; on the morow folowing conueyed &amp; caried to ye abby or blak freres at Cherteſſey, &amp; ther was buried

He lyued vnto he was .lii. yeres of age, and had by his wife quene Margaret one ſoōne called Edward.
                  Nowe to the entent yt Edward the kyng might liue in quiet after this manne his death, he went a boute to ſerche all the rebelles that thei might bee weeded out of the compaignie of menne as pernicious and vnprofitable to the publique weale. At what tyme he tooke tharchebiſhop of Yorke brother to therle of Warwike and ſent hym priſoner to Guynes, wher he long remained in holde, but after dimiſſed, dyed ſhortely for thought and penſifulnes of mynde, alſo he attached the erle of Oxenford the whiche from the ceaſon of Barnet felde had holden ſainct Michaelles Mounte, &amp; by his cōmaundement was had to a caſtell beyond yt ſea called Hant, wher he remained priſoner yt ſpace of xii. yeares. Furthermore vpō cōſideraciō yt no rebelles or traitours might haue any refuge to ſtraūge coūtres, he had made a league wt the kyng of ſcottes of peace &amp; amitee to bee obſerued &amp; kepte for yt

monye for ſo dooyng. But yt duke, to make a ſhort tale, would by no meanes deliuer theim out of his handes, but ſo kepte theim, that thei neuer might bee in any daūger of their enemies through hym. Edward therfore in this his thirtene yere of his reigne, whiche was the yere of our lord a thouſand foure hundred three ſcore and thirteen, helde his parlyament at Weſtminſter, wher firſt he cauſed all the ſtatutes and actes of his whiche wer abrogated by Henry the ſixt, to ſtand and bee of good effecte, then the goodes of theſe traitours to be beſtowed &amp; gyuen abrode, alſo the baniſhed menne yt fled as rebelles and falſe to their countree, to bee brought in, &amp; that if any grudge or eiuill will wer betwixt any one or other of the nobilite, that ther it ſhould bee forgottē, &amp; turned to loue, &amp; laſtly that certain mony ſhould bee payed to the kyng towardes yt greate charges of his werre. When he had thus ſtudied &amp; determined to liue quietly &amp; ſet his realme in good ordre, Charles ye duke of Burgoin ſēt for aide to hym againſt Lewes ye Frēche kyng ſo yt he could neuer bee at reſt, but one thyng or other ſhuld diſquiet hym, for he could not deny hym helpe conſideryng ye benefites yt he had receiued of hym at diuerſe &amp; ſūdry tymes before yt, &amp; yt he nowe fought againſt his dedly enemie whiche aided the erle of Warwike bothe wt menne &amp; mony to come againſt hym. Wherfore he aſſēblyng his coūſaill together, &amp; ſhewyng theim the matter, ſent woord to the duke yt he would kepe one piece or parte of a battail agaīſt ye kyng. For in deede at yt ſame tyme there was mortall battaill betwixt the duke &amp; Lewes yt kyng, &amp; becauſe that the ſame Lewes was a

very harde manne &amp; churliſhe &amp; alſo hurtefull aſwell to his frēdes as to his foes, many Frēchmen abhorryng his cōdicions, did conſent to hold with yt duke. And emong many other, one Lewes of Lucēburge did apoinct wt the duke to dooe miſchief to hym one waye or other, ſo yt the kyng was bothe in daūger of his owne coūtree menne, &amp; alſo of the duke beyng a ſtraūger. The duke ſhewed this to kyng Edward, yt he might the ſoner allu

And vpō this, kyng Edward toke his voiage to Fraūce, takyng beſides his tribute yt he had, certain mony of ye lordes &amp; commons of the realme, which thei of their owne gētlenes gaue vn to hym, to ye ſuſtenaūce &amp; maintenyng of his armie And for yt, the kyng called that tribute &amp; leuiyng of mony, beneuolēce, whiche neuertheleſſe was giuen wt an eiuill will of many one. But he vſyng ſuche gētle faſſions towardes theim, &amp; praiyng theim ſo hartely of their aſſiſtaunce yt thei could none other wiſe dooe but geue it hym. Whiche whē he had, he gathered his armie whiche was .xx. M. &amp; went to Caleys ye .iiii. daye of July. Whō Charles yt duke did mett, &amp; reioyſyng gretely at his victory did inſtantly deſire hym that he would ſticke ſtoutely to this battaill, yt he might haue of yt Frenche kyng yt he had loſt by hym. But when Lewes yt kyng hard that Edward came wt his armie, he encreaſed the nombre of his people as muche as he could &amp; the more nigher the daunger that he was, the ſooner &amp; haſtely he came vpon theim. And with this armie he ſent foorthe Robert of Stoteuill a noble capitain to the cooſtes Atrebatium to reſyſt the power of the Engliſhe menne. And the kyng hym ſelf taried

at Siluanect, caſtyng wt hymſelf what waye he might make a league of peace betwixt yt duke &amp; yt kyng of England &amp; hym. Heryng therfore that yt king was gone to Atrebates, he ſēt ambaſſodours to hym for peace: whoſe myndes when yt kyng had knowē, although he had foūd but litle frēdſhip at his hādes in tymes paſt, yet conſideryng yt all his ſubſtaūce &amp; treaſure was waſted in ciuile battail, &amp; that he was not hable to maintein a newe hooſt if nede ſhuld be, nor yet vnneth ſuſtein theim whom he had vnder his bāner, thought beſt euē for pure neceſſite to leaue to peace &amp; growe to atonemēt wt Lewes yt kyng. The whiche thyng he might dooe alſo ſauing his honour, cōſideryng yt bothe ye duke &amp; Robert of Lucēburge aforenamed had not dooē accordyng to their promiſe. So yt, at the deſire of ye ambaſſadours he went to ſpeake with the kyng at Pinquinake a toune in Ambiā ſhire wher noble mēne dooe aſſēble together, &amp; there found y• kyng.

After yt truce made &amp; mony paid, kyng Edward wēt to Caleis, &amp; from thēs to Englād. In this battaill none was ſlain ſauyng onely yt duke of Exceter, ye whiche māne was in ſētuary before, &amp; cōmaunded to folowe y• kyng was put to death cōtrary to yt promiſe made. This was the yere of our lord. M .CCCC .lxxv. frome that tyme foorth Lewes yt kyng payed duely his raunſome to Edward, vnto the laſte yere before

he dyed, at what tyme he denyed the paymente, as though he knewe before his laſte dayes. But the duke of Burgoyne and Roberte of Lucenburgh, after they had knowen that Edwarde had made a league wyth Lewes the kynge, they freted ſore with hym, and wrote ſharpe letters of thretenyng and tauntyng hym, ſaiyng: that he was the cauſe that they reuenged not theimſelfes of the kyng. Whoſe fyrye and thundryng wordes the kyng no more paſſed vpon, then of the turnyng of his hāde And as for Lucenburgh he was taken pryſoner, and for his proude and malicious writyng, behedded at Lutece.
                  Thus kyng Edward beyng in quietnes both in his countre and abrode alſo, although he mighte wel thynke hymſelf to lyue ſo perpetually, for yt he had been ſo great a conquerour, yet conſideryng yt the erle of Richemōde was of nigh affinitee to Hē
                     ry the .vi. he was not out of feare &amp; daunger. Therfore he thought ones to attempte the duke of Britayn agayn, with giftes, promyſes &amp; faire wordes that he might haue y• erle, whō he thought to rule as he would, after that his aunceſtrie was geuen. The ambaſſadours came to the duke with a great ſubſtaunce of mony, &amp; that their requeſt might bee the honeſtier, they ſhewed the duke that they came to deſire the erle of hym, that he mighte marye the kynges doughter, ſo that by affinite, al euil wyll &amp; grudge might be forgotten, and ſedicion vtterlye reiected, although they entended not ſo to cauſe al ſuche thynges to bee forgotten, but by the death &amp; kyllyng of hym. The duke after longe and muche deniyng theim, at the laſte thorowe muche entreatyng,

and alſo great rewardes that was brought gaue the earle to theim, ſendynge a letter to the kynge, in prayſe and commendation of hym, not thynkynge that he commytted the lambe to the woulfe, but the ſoonne to the father. The ambaſſadours was verye glad, that they had got hym, and ſayled into Englande, in all the haſte they coulde. But the earle knowynge well that he wēt to hys death, for ſorowe and care that he conceaued in hys mynde, was caſte in an agewe. When he was goone, one Ihon Chenlet, ſuche a man as could not bee found agayne in al the countre, &amp; in great fauour wt the duke, hearing of yt dede, being very ſore moued therwith, wēt to the dukes place &amp; coming before his grace, ſtode lyke a man ſtrykē with ſome ſodeyn dyſeaſe, very pale &amp; holding his head downe, the duke maruayling at hym, enquyred what the matter was. To whom he ſayde. O mooſt noble duke, my time is at hande, &amp; thys palenes betokeneth death without remidy. That I would God yt had come before this day, &amp; then it ſhould not haue greued me ſo much. And thys all cometh to me through a deed yt you haue done of late, which wil ether cauſe me to loſe my life, or els to lyue in mooſt miſerie &amp; wretchednes as one wery of thys preſent lyfe. The noble actes yt you haue doone, (mooſt noble prynce) haue enhaunſed your fame &amp; glory to the fardeſt part of the world but this one thing me thynke (I praye you pardō
                     me what I ſaye) is a great blemyſhe to your dygnitee, that forgetting the promyſe that you made ſo faythfully haue geuen the innocēt erle of Richmounte to be deſtroyed, &amp; pitefully killed emonge

wretched knau es &amp; hangmen. Wherfore, they yt loue you, of whom I am one, cannot but lamente 
                        •
                     o ſee you dyſhonored by this great fault of periury. Whē he had ſayd, the duke anſwered, hold thy peace man I praye the, ther is no ſuch harme ſhal chaunce to him, Edwarde the kinge woulde haue him to mary his daughter. Then ſayd Iohn, Beleue me (mooſte excellente and redoubted prynce) this Henry is nowe almoſte famyſhed and loſte, &amp; yf he once goo out of your countree, he is but caſt awaye and paſte all recouerye. At theſe wordes ye duke was perſuaded, through the whych he commaūded one Peter Lādoſon hys receauer, to take the ſame Henry frō the ambaſſadours. The ſayd receauer purſued the Englyſhe ambaſſadours to Maclonium, and there holdyng theim wyth long cōmunication, made him to be conueyed into a ſē
                     tuary, whych was then almoſt ded through that feuer and thought whych he was caſte in. And ſo after that he was emended broughte hym to the duke. The ambaſſadours then beyng ſpoiled and deceaued, both of theyr pread and mony that they brought, deſyred yt ſame receauer that they might not goo home in that wyſe, whyche receauer promiſed, that he woulde eyther kepe hym in ſentuary, or eles cauſe hym to be impriſoned at the duke his place, ſo that they ſhould neuer neede to feare hym.
                  In all thys tyme Edwarde beynge deſyreous to knowe what became of the Earle, was enfourmed, that he was taken pryſoner, but after that eſcaped theyre handes, where at the kinge was verye angrye: but when he knewe that he

ſhould bee kepte in holde, was well pleaſed &amp; then dyd take no thought. And liued after, &amp; that moſt welthy, ſparing no expēſes nor coſt in kepyng his houſe, neuertheles, he dyd fall into one great offence in this time. For ſodēly, he cōmaunded his brother the duke of Clarence to be killed &amp; drowned in an hogſhhed of malmeſey. And the cauſe of hys death was, as men report, through a certaine prophecie, which ſayd ye after kyng Edwarde, one ſhuld reigne, whoſe name begā wyth a.

Some holdeth another opinion of this his death, ſaiyng: yt at what time ye olde malice dyd breke out bewixt thē both, ye duke through his ſiſters councel, woulde haue maried lady Mary yt duke of Burgoyn his only daughter, which mariage ye kyng did infringe &amp; ſtoppe, as one enuiyng of his brothers felicitee, or good chaunce. After that they both beryng in theyr mindes mortall hatred, one of the ſayde duke hys ſeruauntes, was accuſed of wichcraft &amp; charming for which offence, he was put to death. The duke

                  And this duke had .ii. children, one lady Margarete, that was after maried to Richard Pole, &amp;

an other Edward, whome the kyng made earle of Warwyke, but this childe folowyng the fate and deſtenie of his father, was after putte in priſone, &amp; there priuely put to death. And theſe thinges were doone in the yere of oure Lorde a thouſand foure The .xix. yere. hundreth and foure ſcore, and the .xix. yere of the reigne of kyng Edward. And two yeres then after folowing, the kyng died, before ye whiche yeres he beganne to bee very harde and couetouſe in getting monye, and alſo very diligent in marking &amp; attaching his lordes that did offend. In this time the kyng of Scottes willed his ſoōne Iamy to be maried to the kynges doughter lady Cicile, which was the yonger, that ſhould haue been maried to Charles the kyng his ſoonne of Fraunce. But it chaunced not, thorow Lewes the kyng that brake his promiſe, bothe in geuing his ſeruice, and payeng his raunſome the laſte yere of his reigne.
                  Likewiſe the kyng of Scottes ſeing that Lewes the kyng was falſe of his promiſe, he thoughte he might bee ſo bolde too, and ſo breaking league of amite, ſette vpon the Engliſhe men. At the which Edward was ſore vexed, and entended batayl againſt hym, yet after that he knewe ye it was not by his wyll, but thorowe the councell and euell diſpoſed mindes of his lordes, woulde haue borne it in good worthe, had not kyng Iames owne brother ſtreight vpon that, prouoked hym to fighte. Furthermore, ſuche was the nature of the Scottiſhe kyng that when he had ſette his minde vpon a thing, no manne coulde turne hym, and becauſe that no manne mighte reproue hym in any thing, he promoted laye people, &amp; menne of baſſe bloude

to his counſell, putting to deathe, or baniſhyng euermore the nobilitee Emong whom this duke of Albanie his brother, conſydering the condicyons of the king, fled to ye kyng of Englād at what time he was ſent into Fraūce, &amp; ther counſailed ye kyng to fight againſt hym. The king willing to reuēge his olde iniuries, vpon many conſideraciōs gathered, entēded no leſſe by ye helpe of the ſaied duke of Albany, then to kepe open warre. So yt he did ſend the duke of Glouceſtre, ye erle of Northumberlād, ſyr Thomas Stanley, &amp; this duke of Albany wt a great power of men againſt ye Scottes. The king knowing of their cōming, went to Barwyke with his army to kepe theim from the borders, but perceiuing that he was not hable ſo reſiſt their great power, fled backe in ye night to Edinbrough &amp; ther taryed for his enemies. And ye duke of Glouceſtre folowing, burned and ſpoyled all the way, &amp; when he was ſomewhat nighe his enemies, perceiuing alſo that none of the Scottiſhe lordes came to the duke of Albanye, miſtruſted that ſome deceyte or crafte was wrought, &amp; ſo laboured to haue peace, whiche gotten, he went backe to the caſtell of Barwike, that ſir Thomas Stanley had wonne a lytell before. And the duke of Albany ye authoure of this warre, for yt he had but lytle thankes of England for his ſo dooing, fled into Fraunce, &amp; there was kylled running at the tylte in Parys. After this buſineſſe Edward aſſembled his counſell together, &amp; willed theim to prepare batayle againſte the Frenche kyng, for that he had neyther payde nor woulde paye his raunſome, nor yet geue his ſoonne in mariage to his doughter (as he promiſed)

to the ſetting forth of ye which batayl, certaine mony was exacted of the preſtes &amp; religiouſe men to be payde. At the which time ye kyng was ſodēly ſickened, &amp; ſhortly after died at Weſtminſter ye .ix. day of April then being .l. yeres of age, &amp; reigning xxiii. after the date of oure Lorde a.

A lytell before his death, it was ſaied that he gaue hym ſelfe to auarice, whiche before, as you ſee, vſed greate liberalytee. Yet the realme whiche thorowe ciuile ſedicyon was greatly impoueryſhed, he made ryche and plenteouſe at his death daye.
                  Alſo he gaue ſpiritual promocions to the moſte excellent and famous clerkes, and made theim of his councell, other of the laye ſorte, whome he loued, he did not enriche with poſſeſſions but with monye and other lyke goodes, the whiche many prynces, hauyng no reſpecte of the honoure, dooe not alwayes obſerue. By the whiche ſuche giftes &amp; rewardes he had ſo farre wonne the hartes of the people, that after his deathe many menne dyd lamente the loſſe of his grace.

                        WHEN ALMIGHTIE GOD had called to his mercye the noble prince kyng Edwarde the fourth of that name, Edward his eldeſt ſonne (prynce of Wales) began his reygne the .ix. daye of Aprill, in yt yere of oure Lorde a. M .CCCC .lxxxiij. and in the .xxij. yere of Lewes the .xi. then Frenche kyng. Whiche younge prince reigned a ſmal ſpace and lytle ſeaſon ouer this realme, other in pleaſure or libertee, for his vncle Richard duke of Gloceter, within .iij. monethes depriued hym, not only of his croune and regalytie, but alſo vnnaturally bereft hym his naturall life, and for the declaracion by what craftie engine he firſt attempted his vngracious purpoſe, &amp; by what falſe colourable &amp; vntrue allegaciōs he ſet forth openly his pretenſed enterpriſe, &amp; fynally by what ſhamefull cruell and deteſtable acte he perfourmed the ſame: Ye muſte fyrſt conſyder of whom he and his brother deſcended, there natures condicions &amp; inclynacions, and thē you ſhall eaſely perceaue, that there could not be a more crueller tyraunt appoynted to acheue a more abomynable enterpryſe.
                  There father was Richard Plantagenet duke of Yorke, whiche began not by warre but by lawe to chalenge the croune of Englande, puttyng his clayme in the parliamēt, holden yt .xxx. yere of kyng

Henry the .vi. where ether for right or for fauoure his cauſe was ſo ſet forthe and auaunced that the bloodde of the ſayd kyng Henry, although he had a goodly ſonne was clerely abiected, and yt croune of the realme (by autorytee of parliamente) entayled to the duke of Yorke and his heyres after the diſceaſe of the ſayd kyng Henrye the .vi. But the duke not entendyng ſo long to tary, but myndyng vnder the preterte of diſcencion growen and aryſen within the realme, and of couenauntes made in the parliament, not kepte but broken, to preuēte the tyme and to take vpon hym the gouernaunce in kyng Henryes life, was by to muche hardynes ſlayne at the battayle of Wakefylde, leuynge behynde hym three ſonnes, Edwarde, George &amp; Richard. Al theſe three as they wer greate eſtates of byrth, ſo were they greate and ſtatelye of ſtomake, gredy of autoritee and impaciēt parteners of rule and autoritee. This Edward reuēged his fathers death and depoſed kyng Henry the .vi. and atteyned the croune and ſceptre of this realme. George duke of Clarence was a goodlye and well feautured prince, in all thynges fortunate, yf ether his owne ambiciō had not ſet him againſt his brother or thenuie of his enemies had not ſet his brother agaynſt hym, for were it by the quene or ye nobles of her bloode, which highly maligned the kynges kynred (as women cōmenlye, not of malyce but of nature, hate ſuche as theyr huſbandes loue) or wer it aproude appetite of the duke hym ſelfe, entendyng to bee kyng, at the leaſte wiſe heynous treaſon was layde to his charge, and finally were he in faute or were he fauteleſſe, attaynted was he by

parliament and iudged to deathe, and thereupon haſtely drouned in a butte of malmeſey, within ye towre of Londō. Whoſe death kyng Edward (although he commaunded it) when he wyſte it was done, pyteouſlye he bewayled and ſorowfullye he repented it. Richard duke of Glouceſtre the .iij. ſonne (of whiche I muſte mooſte entreate) was in The deſcripciō of Richarde the thyrde. witte and courage eguall with the other, but in beautee and lyniamentes of nature farre vnderneth both, for he was lytle of ſtature, euill feautered of lymmes, croke backed, the lift ſhulder much higher then the right, harde fauoured of vyſage ſuche as in eſtates is called a warlike vyſage, and amonge commen perſons a crabbed face. He was malycious, wrothfull and enuyous, and as it is reported, his mother the duches had much a dooe in her trauayle, yt ſhe could not be delyuered of hym vncutte, and that he came into the worlde the fete forwarde, as men be borne outwarde, and as the fame ranne, not vntothed, whether that men of hatred reported aboue the truthe, or yt nature chaunged his courſe in his begynnyng, which in his life many thynges vnnaturally cōmytted, this I leue to Goddes iudgemēt. He was none euell capitayn in warre, as to whiche, his diſpoſicion was more enclyned to then to peace. Sōdry victories he had &amp; ſome ouerthrowes, but neuer for defaute in his owne perſon, either for lacke of hardynes or polytike order. Fre he was of his diſpences &amp; ſomwhat aboue his power lyberall, wt large giftes he gatte hym vnſtedfaſt frēdſhip, for whiche cauſe he was fayn to borowe, pil &amp; extorte in other places, which gat hym ſtedfaſt hatred. He was cloſe &amp; ſecrete, a

depe dyſſymuler, lowly of coūtenaūce, arrogāte of herte, outwardly famylyer, where he inwardly hated, not lettyng to kyſſe whome he thought to kyll diſpiteous and cruell, not alwaye for eiuyll wyll, but after for ambycion and to ſerue his purpoſe, frende &amp; fooe wer all indifferent, where his auaū
                     tage grewe, he ſpared no mānes death whoſe lyfe withſtode his purpoſe. He ſlewe in the towre kyng Henry the .vi. (ſaiyng: nowe is there no heyre male of kyng Edward the thyrde, but we of the houſe of Yorke) whiche murder was done without kynge Edwardes aſſent, whiche would haue appoynted that bocherlye office to ſome other, rather then to his owne brother. Some wiſe mē alſo wene, yt hys drift lacked not in helpyng forth his owne brother of Clarence to his death, whiche thyng in all apparaunce he reſiſted, although he inwardly mynded it. And the cauſe thereof was, as men notynge his doynges and procedynges did marke (becauſe that he longe in kyng Edwardes tyme thought to opteyne the croune, in caſe that the kyng his brother whoſe life he loked that euyl dyet would ſone ſhorten) ſhould happē to diſeaſe (as he did in dede) his chyldrē beyng yoūg. And then yt if duke of Clarence had lyued his pretenſed purpoſe had been farre hyndered. For yf the duke of Clarence had kept hym ſelf true to his nephewe the yong kyng, or would haue takē vpō him to be kyng, euery one of theſe caſtes had been a troumpe in the duke of Glouceſters waye: but when he was ſure that hys brother of Clarence was dead, then he knewe that he might woorke without ieopardye. But of theſe poyntes there is certentie, and whoſoeuer deuyneth

or cōiectureth maye as well ſhote to ferre as to ſhorte, but this cōiecture afterward toke place (as fewe dooe) as you ſhall ꝑceaue here after. But afore I declare to you howe this Rychard duke of Glouceſtre began his miſcheuous imagened &amp; pretenced enterpriſe as apꝑantly ſhalbe opened. I muſt a litle putte you in remēbraūce of a louyng and charitable acte no leſſe profitable thē amiable to yt whole cōmynaltie (if it had been ſo inwardely thought as it was outwardly diſſimuled) whiche kyng Edward did liyng on his deathe bedde not long before he dyed, for in his life althoughe that the deuiſion emongeſt his frendes ſomewhat greued &amp; yrked hym, yet in his helth he leſſe regarded &amp; tooke hede to it, by reaſon yt he thought yt he was hable in all thynges to rule bothe ꝑties, were thei neuer ſo obſtinate. But in his laſt ſickeneſſe (whiche cōtinued longer then falſe &amp; fantaſticall tales haue vntruly &amp; falſely ſurmiſed as I my ſelf that wrote this pamphlet truly knew) whē he perceiued his natural ſtrēgth was gone, &amp; hoped litle of recouery by the artes of al his phicyſyans whiche he perceaued onely to prolong his life. Thē he began to conſider the youth of his children, howe be it, he nothyng leſſe miſtruſted then that that happened, yet he wiſely forſeyng and conſideryng that many harmes might enſue by yt debate of his nobles while ye youth of his children ſhould lacke diſcrecion and good counſaill of their frendes, for he knew well that euery part would woorke for their owne cōmoditee, and rather by pleſaunt aduiſe to wynne theim ſelfes fauour, thē by ꝓfitable aduertiſmēt to do yt childrē good, wherfore, liyng on his

death bed at Weſtminſter he called to hym ſuche lordes as thē wer aboute hym whō he knewe to be at variaunce in eſpeciall the lord marques Dorſet ſoonne to the quene, &amp; the lord Haſtynges againſt whō ye quene eſpecially grudged for yt fauor yt the kyng bare hym, &amp; alſo ſhe thought him familier wt the kyng in wāton cōpaignie, hir kynne bare hym ſore, aſwel for yt ye kyng made hym capitain of Caleys which office ye lord Riuers brother to ye quene claimed of yt kynges former promiſe, as of diuerſe other giftes whiche he receaued yt thei loked for. &amp; when theſe lordes wt diuerſe other of both parties were come vnto yt kynges preſens, he cauſed hymſelf to be raiſed vp wt pillous, &amp; as I cā geſſe ſaied The exhortacyō

then his manhode where he vanquiſhed theim. He was of viſage full faced &amp; louelie, of bodie mightie, ſtronge &amp; cleane made, with ouer lyberall and wātō dyet, he waxed ſomewhat corpulēt &amp; bourly, but neuertheleſſe not vncomely. He was of youth greatly geuen to fleſhely wantōnes, from yt which health of bodie in great proſperitee &amp; fortune with out an eſpeciall grace hardlye refrayneth. Thys faulte litle greued his people, for neyther coulde any one mannes pleaſure ſtretche or extende to the diſpleaſure of veraye many, nor a multitude bee greued by a priuate mannes fanteſie or volupteouſneſſe, whē it was doē wtout violēce. And in his latter dayes he left al wild daliaūce &amp; fel to grauitee, ſo yt he brought his realme into a wealthie &amp; ꝓſperous eſtate, al feare of outwarde enemies were clerely extinguiſhed, &amp; no warre was in hande nor none toward, but ſuche as no mā looked for. The people wer toward their prince not in a cōſtrayned feare, but in a true louyng and wylfull obedience emongeſt theimſelfe, and ye commons wer in good peace. The lordes whome he knewe at variaunce, he in his death bed (as he thought) he brought to good concord, loue and amytee. And a lytle before his death, he left gatheryng of mony of his ſubiectes, whiche is the only thyng that draweth yt heartes of Englyſhmē frō their kynges &amp; prynces, nor nothyng he ether entrepryſed ndr toke in hād, by yt which he ſhuld be dryuē thereunto. For his tribute out of Fraūce he had a litle before recouered &amp; obteyned. And yt yere before he dyed he recouered the toune of Berwike againſt yt kyng of Scottes. And albeit yt all yt tyme of his reigne he was ſo benigne

courteous and famylyer, that no parte of his vertues was eſtemed more thē thoſe high humilitees. Yet that condycion in thende of his laſt dayes decayed not, in the whiche many princes by a longe cōtinued ſouereingtie, declyne to a proude porte &amp; behaueoure from theyr condicions accuſtomed at their begynnyng. Yet lowlynes and gentlenes ſo farre forth in hym encreaſed that the ſōmer before died, he beyng at the haueryng at the bowre, ſente for the mayre and aldermenne of London thyther only to hunte and make paſtyme, where he made theim not ſo hartie but ſo famylyer and frendlye chere, and ſent alſo to theyr wyues ſuche plentie of venyſon, that no one thyng in many dayes before gatte hym eyther mo heartes or more hartie fauoure emongeſt the commen people, whiche often tymes more eſteme and take for greate kyndnes a lytle courteſye, then a greate profyte or benefyte. And ſo this noble prynce deceaſſed, as you haue hearde in that tyme when his lyfe was mooſte deſyred, &amp; whē his people moſte deſyred to kepe hym. Whiche loue of his people &amp; their entiere affecciō towarde hym, had bene to his noble chyldren, (hauyng in theim ſelfes alſo as many gyftes of nature, as many princely vertues, as much good towardneſſe as their age coulde receaue) a meruelous fortreſſe and a ſure armoure, yf the deuyſion and diſſencion of their frendes had not vnarmed them &amp; left them deſtitute, &amp; the execrable deſyre of ſouereingtie ꝓuoked him to their deſtrucciō, which if either kynd or kyndneſſe had holdē place muſte nedes haue beē their chieſe defence. For Richarde duke of Glouceter, by nature their vncle, by office

their protectoure, to their father greatly beholden and to theim by othe and allegeaunce bounden all the bandes broken and violated, that bynde manne and manne together, withoute anye reſpecte of God or the worlde, vnnaturally contryued to bereaue theim not onely of their dignytee and preheminence, but alſo of their natural lyues and worldely felicytee.
                  And fyrſte to ſhewe you that by coniecture he pretended this thing in his brothers lyfe, ye ſhall vnderſtande for a trueth that the ſame nyght that king Edward died, one called Miſtelbrooke, long ere the daye ſprange came to the houſe of one Potier dwelling in Redcroſſe ſtrete withoute Creple gate of London, and when he was with haſtie rapping, quickely let in, y• ſaied Miſtelbrooke ſhewed vnto Potier that kyng Edward was yt nighte deceaſed: by my trueth ꝙ Potier, then wil my maſter the duke of Gloucetre be kyng and that I warrāt the. What cauſe he had ſo to thinke, harde it is to ſay, whether he being his ſeruaūt knewe any ſuch thing prepenſed or otherwiſe had any inklingther of, but of all likelihode he ſpake it not of naughte.
                  But nowe to retourne to the trewe hiſtory, wer it that the duke of Gloucetre had of olde ſore practiſed this concluſyon, or was before tyme moued therunto and put in hope by the tender age of the young princes his nephewes, as oportunitee and likely of ſpede putteth a manne in courage of that that he neuer entended. Certen it is, that he being in the Northe partyes for the good gouernaunce of the countrey, being aduertiſed of his brothers deathe contriued the deſtruccion of his nephewes

with yt vſurpacion of the roiall dignitee &amp; croune And for aſmuche as he well wyſte, and had holpe to maynteine, a long continued grudge and harte burnynge betwene the Quenes kynred and the kynges bloodde (either parte enuiyng others authorytee) he nowe thought (as it was in dede) a fertherly beginning to the purſute of his entent and a ſure grounde &amp; ſituacion of his vnnaturall building, if he might vnder the pretence of remēbring of olde dyſpleaſures abuſe the ignoraunce &amp; angre of the one partie to the deſtruccion of yt other, and then to wynne to his purpoſe as many as he coulde, and ſuche as coulde not bee wonne, might bee loſte or they looked therfore. But of one thing he was certaine, that if his intent wer once perceaued, he ſhould haue made peace betwene both parties with his owne bloodde, but all his intente he kept ſecrete tyll he knewe his frendes, of ye whiche Henry the duke of Buckingham was the fyrſte yt ſent to hym after his brothers deathe a truſty ſeruaunt of his called Perſall to the cytee of Yorke, where the Duke of Gloucetre kepte the kyng his brothers funeralles. This Perſall came to Iohn Ward a ſecrete chaumberer to the duke of Gloucetre, deſiryng that he in cloſe and couerte manier might ſpeake with the duke his maiſter: wherupō in the deed of the nyght the duke ſente for Perſall (all other beyng aduoyded) whiche ſhewed to the duke of Gloucetre that the duke of Buckingham his maiſter in this newe worlde would take ſuche parte as he woulde &amp; woulde farther wayte vpon hym with a. M. good fellowes yf nede were. The duke ſent backe yt meſſanger with great thankes

and diuerſe preuey inſtruccions by mouthe, which Perſall did ſomuche by his trauaile that he came to the duke of Buckyngham his maiſter into the marches of Wales, &amp; eftſones with newe inſtruccions met with the duke of Gloucetre at Notingham, whiche was come oute of the Northcoūtrey with many knightes &amp; gentylmenne to the noumbre of .vi. C. horſe &amp; more, in his iourney towarde London. And after ſecrete meting and cōmunicacion had betwene hym &amp; the duke of Gloucetre he retourned with ſuche ſpede yt he brought the duke of Buckingham his maſter to mete wt the duke of Gloucetre not farre from Northampton with .iii. C. horſſes, &amp; ſo they twoo came together to Northampton where they fyrſt beganne their vnhappy enterprice, and ſo the duke of Buckingham contynued ſtil wt the duke of Gloucetre till he was crouned kyng, as ye ſhall plainly perceaue hereafter.
                  The younge kyng at the deathe of his father kepte houſholde at Ludlowe, for his father had ſente hym thyther for Iuſtice to bee doone in the marches of Wales, to the ende that by the authoritee of his preſence, the wylde Welſhemenne and euell dyſpoſed perſonnes ſhoulde refraine frome their accuſtomed murthers and outerages. The gouernaunce of this younge Prynce was cōmitted to Lorde Anthony Wooduile, Earle Riuers &amp; Lorde Scales, brother to the Quene, a wiſe, hardye and honourable perſonage, as valyaunte of hande as pollitick of counſell, and with him were aſſocyate other of the ſame partye, and in effecte euery one as he was nere of kinne vnto the quene ſo was he planted nexte aboute the Prynce.

That dryfte by the Quene ſemed to bee deuyſed, whereby her bloodde myghte of ryghte in tender youth bee ſo planted in the prynces fauoure, that afterwarde it ſhoulde hardely bee eradicated oute of the ſame.
                  The duke of Gloucetre turned all this to their diſtruccion, and vpon that grounde ſette the foundacion of his vnhappy building. For whome ſoeuer he perceaued to bee at varyaunce with theim, or to beare toward hym ſelf any fauoure, he brake vnto theim, ſome by mouthe, ſome by writing and ſecrete meſſengers, that it was neither reaſon nor yet to bee ſuffered that the younge kyng their maiſter and kinſmanne ſhould bee in the handes and cuſtody of his mothers kinrede, ſequeſtred in maner frome their company &amp; attendaunce, of which euery one ought hym as faithfull ſeruice as they, and many of theim of farre more honorable parte of kynne then his mothers ſyde, whoſe bloodde ꝙ the Duke of Gloucetre ſauyng the Kynges pleaſure, was farre vnmete to bee matched with his, whiche nowe to bee remoued frome the kyng and the leaſt noble to bee lefte aboute hym is, ꝙ he neyther honourable to his maieſtie nor to vs, &amp; alſo to hym leſſe ſuretye, to haue the nobleſt and mightieſt of his frendes frome hym, and to vs all no lytle ieopardye to ſuffer, and ſpecially oure well proued euel willers to growe in too too greate authorytee wt the king in youth, namely whiche is light of belefe and ſoone perſwaded. Ye remembre that kyng Edward hym ſelf, albeit he was both of age and diſcrecion, yet was he ruled in many thinges by yt bende more then ſtoode either wt his honoure

or oure profyte, or wyth the commoditee of anye manne elles, excepte onely the immoderate aduaū
                     cemente of theim ſelues, whiche whether they thriſted ſore after theyr owne wele or no, it were harde I thynke to geſſe. And yf ſome folkes frendſhype had not holden better place wyth the kynge then anye reſpecte of kynred, they myghte (paraduenture) eaſely haue trapped and brought to confuſyon ſome of vs or thys, &amp; why not as eaſly as they haue done ſome other or thys as nere of the blood royall, but oure lorde hathe wroughte hys wyll, and thanked be hys grace that perell is paſt, how beit, as greate is growing if we ſuffer this young kynge in his enemyes handes, whyche wythoute his wyttinge myghte abuſe the name of hys commaundemente to any af our vndoing, which thynges God &amp; good prouyſion forbyd, of whych good prouyſion none of vs hathe any thynge the leſſe nede for the late attonemente made, in which the kynges pleaſure had more place then the parties heartes or willes, nor none of vs is ſo vnwiſe ouerſone to truſte a newe frende made of an olde fooe, or to thynke that anye onely kyndenes ſo ſodenly contracted in an houre, contynued ſcantlye yet a fortnyght, ſhoulde be deper ſet in our ſtomackes then a longe accuſtomed malice many yeres rooted.
                  With theſe perſwaſions and wrytinges, yt duke of Glouceter ſet a fyre theim whiche wer eaſye to kindle, &amp; in eſpecyall twayne, Henry duke of Buckyngham and Wyllyam Lorde Haſtynges and Lorde Chamberlayn, both menne of honour and of great power, the one by lōg ſuceceſſiō from his

aunceters, the other by hys offyces and the kynges fauoure. Theſe two not bearynge eache to other ſo muche loue as hatred, both to the quenes bloodde accorded together with the duke of Glouceter that they would remoue frome the kyng all his mothers frēdes, vnder the name of theyr enemyes.
                  Wherupon the duke of Glouceter beynge aduertyſed that the lordes about the kyng entended to brynge him to London to hys coronation, accō
                     panyed wyth ſuch a nomber of theyr frendes that it ſhoulde be harde for hym to bryng hys purpoſe to paſſe wythoute the aſſemblinge and gathering of people and in maner of open warre, wherof the ende he wyſt was doubtefull, and in the whyche, the kynge beynge on the other ſyde, he ſhoulde haue the name and face of rebellion.
                  He ſecretelye therefore by dyuers meanes, cauſed the quene to be perſwaded that it was nether nede and ſhoulde alſo bee ieopardeous the kinge to come vp ſo ſtronge, for as nowe, euery lorde loued other and none other thynge ſtudyed for, but the tryumphe of his coronation and honoure of yt kyng. And the lordes aboute the kyng, ſhould aſſēble in the kinges name much people, they ſhuld geue the lordes betwyxte whome and theim there had bene ſome tyme debate, to feare and ſuſpecte leaſte they ſhoulde gather thys people, not for the kynges ſauegarde, whom no man impugned, but for theyr deſtruccyon, hauynge more regarde to theyr olde varyaunce then to theyr newe attonemente, for the whyche cauſe they on the other part myght aſſemble men alſo for theyr defence, whoſe

powres ſhe wyſte well farre ſtretched, and thus ſhould al the realme fall in a roare, and of the miſchiefe that thereof ſhoulde enſue (whiche was lykly to be not a lytle) the moſt harme was lyke to fal where ſhe leaſte woulde, and then all the worlde woulde put her and her kynred in the blame, ſaiynge that they had vnwſelye and vntruely broken the amytie and peace whyche the kynge her huſbande had ſo prudently made betwene her kinred &amp; hys, whyche amytee hys kinne had alwaies obſerued.
                  The quene beyng thus perſwaded ſente worde to the kynge and to her brother, that there was no cauſe ner nede to aſſemble anye people, and alſo the duke of Glouceter and other lordes of his bēd wrot vnto the kinge ſo reuerently and to the quenes frendes there ſo louyngely, that they nothing earthlye myſtruſtyng, broughte the young kyng toward London wt a ſober compaignie in greate haſt (but not in good ſpede) til he came to Northāpton, and frō thēce he remoued to Stony ſtratford On whyche daye, the two dukes and theyr bende came to Northampton, faynynge that Stonye ſtratforde coulde not lodge theim all, where they founde the Earle Ryuers, entendynge the nexte moruynge to haue folowed the kynge, and to bee wyth hym earely in the mornyng. So that nyght the dukes made to the earle Riuers frendly chere but aſſone as they were departed verye famylier wyth greate curteſie in opē ſyghte and the erle Riuers lodged, the .ii. dukes with a few of theyr pryuye frendes fell to councell wherein they ſpente a greate part of the nyght, and in the dawning of

the daye they ſente about pryuely to ther ſeruauntes in theyr lodgynges to haſte to horſebacke for theyr lordes were in maner redy to ryde, wheruppon all theyr ſeruauntes were ready or the Lorde Ryuers ſeruauntes wer awake. Nowe had the dukes taken the keyes of the ynne in to theyr poſſeſſion, ſo that none ſhoulde yſſue oute wythout their concente. And ouer thys in the hygh way toward Stony ſtratforde they ſet certaine of theyr folkes that ſhoulde cauſe and compell to retourne again all perſons that were paſſinge frome Nōrthampton to Stony ſtratforde, ſayinge that the dukes theim ſelfes woulde be the fyrſt that ſhould come to the kynge from Northampton, thus they bare folkes in hande. But when the earle Ryuers vnderſtode the gates cloſed and the wayes on euery ſyde beſet, nether hys ſeruauntes, nether hym ſelf ſuffered to goo oute, perceauinge ſo great a thing wythoute his knowledge, not begon for noughte, comparyng thys preaſent dooynge wyth the laſte nyghtes cherein ſo fewe houres, ſo great a chaūce marueleouſly myſlyked it. Howbeit, ſyth, he could not get awaye, he determined not to kepe him ſelf cloſe, leaſte he ſhoulde ſeme to hyde hym ſelfe for ſome ſecret fear of hys owne faute, wherof he ſaw no ſuch cauſe in him ſelfe, wherfore, on the ſuretie of hys owne conſience he determyned to go to thē and to inquire what thys matter myghte meane. Whome aſſone as they ſaw, they beganne to quarell wyth hym, affyrmyng that he pretended to ſet dyſtaunce betwene the kyng and theim to bryng theim to confucyon, whyche ſhould not lye in his powre and when he began as he was an el oequēt

manne) in godly wiſe to excuſe hym ſelf thei would not here his aunſwer but tooke hym by force and putte hym to ward. And then he mounted on horſback and came in Stony ſtratford wher the kyng was goyng to horſbacke, becauſe he would leaue y• lodgyng for theim, for it was to ſtrayte for bothe the compaignies. And when thei came to his preſence thei alighted and their compaignie aboute theim, and on their knees ſaluted hym, and he theim gētely receaued, nothyng erthely knowyng ner miſtruſtyng as yet. The duke of Buckyngham ſaied aloude, on afore gentlemenne and yomenne kepe your roumes, and therwith in yt kyng his preſence thei picked a quarell to the lord Rychard Grey the quenes ſoonne and brother to the lord marques &amp; halfe brother to the kyng, ſaiyng that he and the marques his brother and the lorde Ryuers his vncle had cōpaſſed to rule the kyng &amp; the realme and ſette varyaūce betwene theſtates, and to ſubdewe and deſtroye the noble bloodde of the realme. And toward thaccompliſhment of theſame, thei ſaied y• lord marques had entred into the toure of London, &amp; thence had takē oute treaſure and ſent mēne to the ſea, whiche thynges theſe dukes knewe well were dooen for a good purpoſe &amp; as very neceſſary, appoincted by yt whole counſail at Londō, but ſomewhat thei muſt haue ſaied, vnto the whiche woordes the kyng aunſwered: what my brother Marques hath dooen I cannot ſaie, but in good faith I dare well aunſwer for myne vncle Ryuers and my brother here, that thei bee innocent of ſuche mattiers, yee my leege ꝙ the duke of Buckyngham, thei haue kepte ye dealyng of

theſe matters farre from the knowledge of your good grace, and foorthwith thei arreſted the lord Rychard and ſir Thomas Vaugham and ſir Rychard Hawte in the kyng his preſence &amp; brought the kyng and all to Northāpton, where thei tooke ferther counſaill in their affaires. And there thei ſent from the kyng whom it pleaſed theim, and ſet aboute hym ſuche ſeruauntes as better pleaſed theim then hym. At whiche dealyng he wept, but it booted not. And at dynner the duke of Glouceſter ſent a dyſhe from his owne table to the lorde Ryuers, praiyng hym to bee of good chere and all ſhould bee well, he thanked hym and prayed the meſſenger to beare it to his nephiewe the lord Rychard with like woordes, whom he knewe to haue neede of conforte, as one to whom ſuche aduerſite was ſtraunge, but he hym ſelf had been all his dayes ennured therwith and therfore could beare it. But for all this meſſage, the duke of Glouceſter ſent the lord Ryuers, ye lord Rychard and ſir Thomas Vaughm̄ and ſir Rychard Hawte into the Northparties into dyuers priſones, but at laſt all came to Poumfrette where thei all foure were behedded without iudge

                     et.
                  In this maner as you haue heard, the duke of Glouceſter tooke on hym the gouernaunce of the younge kyng, whom with muche reuerence he conueighed towardes London. Theſe tidynges came haſtely to the quene before mydnight by a very ſore reporte, that the kyng hir ſoonne was taken and that her brother and her other ſoonne and other hir frendes were areſted and ſent, no manne wyſt whither. With this heuye tydynges the

quene bewayled her childes ruyn, hir frendes miſchaunce and her awne infortune, curſſyng the tyme that euer ſhe was perſwaded to leaue the gatheryng of people to bryng vp the kyng with a greate powre, but that was paſſed, and therfore nowe ſhe tooke hir younger ſoonne the duke of Yorke and hir doughters and went oute of the palais at Weſtminſter into the ſanctuary and there lodged in the abbotes place, and ſhe and all her children and compaignie were regyſtred for ſanctuary perſones. The ſame night there came to docter Rotheram archebyſſhop of Yorke and lorde chauceloure a meſſenger from the lorde chambrelayne to Yorke place beſyde Weſtminſter, the meſſenger was brought to the byſſhoppes bed ſyde and declared to hym that yt dukes were gone backe with the younge kyng to Northamptō, and declared ferther, that the lorde Haſtynges his maſter ſent hym woord that he ſhould feare nothyng for all ſhould bee well. (Well ꝙ the biſſhop,) bee it as well as it will, it will neuer bee ſo well as we haue ſeen it, and then the meſſenger depar

                     ted. Whereupon the byſſhop called vp his ſeruauntes before daye light, and tooke with hym the greate ſeale and came before daye to the quene about whom he founde muche heuyneſſe, rumble, haſte, buſyneſſe, conuerghaunce and caryage of hir ſtuffe into ſanctuary, euery manne was buſye to carye, beare and conueigh ſtuffe, cheſtes and ferdelles, no manne was vnoccupied, and ſome caryed more then thei were commaunded to another place. The quene ſat alone belowe on the ruſſhes all deſolate and dyſmaied, whom the archebiſſhop

conforted in the beſt maner that he coulde, ſhewynge her that the matter was nothynge ſo ſore as ſhe tooke it for, and that he was put in good hope and oute of feare by the meſſage ſente to hym frō the lorde Haſtinges. A wo worth him ꝙ the quene for it is he that goeth aboute to deſtroye me and my bloodde. Madame ꝙ he, be of good comforte and I aſſure you, yf they crowne anye other king then your ſoonne whome they nowe haue, we ſhal on the morowe croune his brother whō you haue here with you. And here is the greate ſeale, which in lykewiſe as your noble huſbande delyuered it to me, ſo I deliuer it to you to the vſe of your ſōne and therewyth delyuered her the greate ſeale, and departed home in the dawnynge of the daye, and when he opened his windowes and looked on the Themys, he myghte ſee the riuer ful of boates of the duke of Glouceter hys ſeruauntes watchyng that no perſon ſhoulde goo to ſanctuary ner none ſhoulde paſſe vnſerched.
                  Then was there great rumoure and commocion in the citee and in other places, the people diuerſly deuined vpō thys dealyng. And dyuerſe lordes knyghtes and gentylmen, ether for fauour of the quene or for feare of them ſelues, aſſembled compaignies together and went flockyng together in harneyes And many alſo, for that they recompted thys demeanour attempted, not ſo eſpecyallye agaynſt other lordes as agaynſt the kyng him ſelf in the dyſturbaunce of hys coronat ion, therefore they aſſembled by and by together to common of thys matter at London. The archebyſhoppe of Yorke fearynge that it woulde be aſcrybed (as it

was in dede) to ouermuche lightnes that he ſo ſodeynly had yelded vp the great ſeale to the quene, to whome the cuſtodie therof nothyng apperteigned without eſpeciall commaundement of yt kyng ſecretly ſent for the ſeale agayn &amp; brought it wyth hym after the accuſtomed maner to mete with the lordes.
                  At this metyng was the lord Haſtynges, whoſe truthe towarde the kyng no manne doubted nor neded not to doubte, perſwaded the lordes to beleue, that the duke of Glouceter was faythfull &amp; ſure towardes his prince, and that yt lord Ryuers, the lorde Richard and other knyghtes apprehended, wer for matters attempted by theim agaynſte the dukes of Gloucetre &amp; Buckyngham put vnder areſt, for their ſuretie, and not for the kynges icopardye, and that they were alſo in ſauegarde there to remayne, tyll the matter were (not by the dukes only) but alſo by all the other lordes of the kynges councell indifferentlye examyned, and by their diſcrecions ordred and eyther iudged or appeſed. And one thyng he aduyſed theim to beware of, that they iudged not the matter to farreforth or they knewe the truthe, nor turnyng theyr pryuate grudges into the commen hurte, irrityng and prouokyng men vnto angre, and diſturbyng the kynges coronacion, toward whiche the dukes wer cō
                     myng, for that then might paraduenture bryng yt matter ſo farre out of ioynte, that it ſhoulde neuer bee brought in frame agayne, whiche yf it ſhould happe as it were lykely to come to a felde, though all parties were in all other thynges eguall, yet ſhoulde the autoryte bee on that ſyde, where the

kynge is hym ſelfe, with theſe perſuaſyons of the lorde Haſtynges, whereof parte he hym ſelfe belcued, and of parte he wyſte well the contrarye, theſe commocyons were ſomewhat appeaſed. But in eſpeciall, becauſe the dukes of Buckyngham and Glouceter wer ſo nere and came on ſo ſhortly with the kynge, in none other maner, nor none other voyce or ſembleaunce then to his coronacion, cauſyng the fame to be blowen about that ſuche perſones as were apprehended had contryued the diſtruccion of the dukes of Gloucetre and of Buekyngham and other of the noble bloodde of thys realme, to thentent that thei alone would rule and gouerne the kyng. And for the coloure therof, ſuch of the dukes ſeruauntes as rode with the cartes of their ſtuffe which wer taken, amonge the which ſtuffe no maruayle thoughe ſome were harneyes whiche at the brekynge vp of ſuche an houſholde muſte be brought awaye or caſte awaye, they ſhewed to the people, and as they went ſayde: lo, here be the barrelles of harneyes that theſe traytoures hadde preuely conueighed in their caryages to deſtroye the noble lordes withall. This dyuerſe, (although it made the matter to wiſe menne more vnlykely) well perceauyng that thentendoures of ſuche a purpoſe woulde rather haue had theyr harneſſe on theyr backes, then to haue bounde theim vp in barrelles, yet muche parte of the commen people were therewith ryght well ſatiſfyed.
                  When the kyng approched nere the cytie, Edmonde Shawe Goldeſmythe then Mayre of the cytie with the aldremenne and ſhreues in ſkarlet, and fyue hundreth commoners in murraye receaued

his grace reuerently at Harneſaye parke, and ſo conueighed hym to the cytee, where he entred the fourthe daye of Maye, in the fyrſte and laſte yeare of his reigne, and was lodged in the biſſhoppes palayce, but the duke of Goucetre bare hym in open ſight ſo reuerently, ſaiyng to all men as he rode, beholde youre prynce and ſouereygne lorde, and made ſuche ſembleaunce of lowlynes to his prince, that frome the greate obloquy that he was in ſo late before, he was ſodeynly fallen in ſo greate truſte, that at the councell next aſſembled he was made the onlye chiefe ruler and thoughte mooſte mete to bee protectoure of the kynge and his realme, ſo that, were it deſteny or were it folye, the lambe was betaken to the wolfe to kepe. At whiche councell the archebyſhoppe of yorke was ſore blamed for delyueryng the greate ſeale to the quene, and the ſeale taken from hym and delyueto docter Iohn Ruſſell byſhoppe of Lyncolne, a wyſe manne and a good and of muche experyence, and dyuerſe lordes and knightes were appoynted to dyuerſe roumes, the lorde chamberlayn and ſome other kepte the roumes yt they were in before, but not many.
                  Nowe were it ſo that the protectour (whiche alwayes you muſte take for the duke of Gloucetre) ſore thriſted for the acheuyng of his pretenſed entrepryſe and thought euerye daye a yere tyll it were perfourmed, yet durſte he no ferther attempte aſlong as he hadde but halfe his praye in hys hande, well wyttynge that yf he depoſed the one brother, all the realme would fall to the other, yf he remayned in ſanctuary or ſhould happely be

ſhortelie cōueyghed to his farther libertee. Wherfore in continēt at the next metyng of the lordes in councell, he purpoſed to theim that it was an heynous thyng of the quene, &amp; procedyng of great ma lyce toward the kynges councelers yt ſhe ſhoulde kepe the kynges brother in ſanctuarye from hym whoſe ſpecial pleaſure &amp; conforte wer to haue his brother wt hym, and that to be done by her to none other intēt but to bryng all ye lordes in an obloquy and murmoure of the people, as though they wer not to be truſted wt the kynges brother, which lordes wer by yt whole aſſ

                  When the Protectoure had ſaied, all the coun cell affirmed that the mocion was good and reaſonable, and to the kyng and the duke his brother honorable, and a thing that ſhoulde ceaſſe great murmoure in the realme yf the mother myght by good meanes bee induced to deliuer hym, whiche thing the Archbiſhop of Cauntourburye, whome they all agreed alſo to bee mooſt conuenient thervnto, tooke vpon hym to moue her, and therto to dooe his vttermoſte endeuoure. How be it yf ſhe coulde in no wiſe bee intreated with her good wil to delyuer hym, then thought he and ſuche of the ſpirytualtye as were preſente, that it were not in anye wyſe to bee attempted to take hym oute agaynſte her wyll, for it woulde bee a thyng that ſhould turne to the grudge of all menne and high diſpleaſure of God, if the pryuiledge of that place ſhould bee broken which had ſo many yeres been kepte, whiche bothe kynges and biſhoppes had graunted and confyrmed, whiche grounde was ſanctifyed by ſainct Peter hym ſelfe more then. v hundreth yeres agone, and ſyth that tyme was neuer ſo vndeuoute a kynge that euer enterpryſed that ſacred priuyledge to vyolate, nor ſo holy a biſhoppe that durſte preſume the churche of the ſame to conſecrate, and therfore ꝙ the Archbyſſhoppe, God forbyd that any manne ſhoulde for any erthely enterpryſe breake the immunyte and libertee of that ſacred Sanctuary that hath bene

the ſauegard of ſo many a good mannes lyfe, but I truſte ꝙ he, we ſhall not nede it, but for any maner of nede I would we ſhould not doo it, I truſt that ſhe with reaſon ſhalbe contented &amp; all thyng in good maner obteigned. And yf it hap that I bring it not to paſſe, yet ſhal I further it to my beſt power ſo that you all ſhall perceaue my good wyl diligence &amp; indeuoure. But the mothers dreade &amp; womanniſhe feare ſhalbe the let yf any bee.
                  Naye womanniſh, frowardneſſe ꝙ the duke of Buckingham, for I dare take it on my ſoule yt ſhe wel knoweth yt ſhe nedeth no ſuche thyng to feare either for her ſonne or for her ſelfe. For as for her, here is no manne that wyll be at warre with womenne, would God ſome menne of her kynne wer womenne to, and then ſhould all bee ſone in reſt. How be it, here is none of her kynne the leſſe loued for that they bee of her kynne, but for their owne euell deſeruing. And put the caſe that we nether loued her nor her kinne, yet there were no cauſe why we ſhould hate the kinges noble brother to whoſe grace we oure ſelues be kynne, whoſe honoure yf ſhe deſyred as oure dyſhonoure, and aſmuche regarde tooke to his wealthe as to her owne wyll, ſhe coulde bee as lothe to ſuffer hym to be abſente from the kyng as any of vs, yf ſhe had any wytte as woulde God ſhe had as good wyll as ſhe hath frowarde wytte. For ſhe thynketh her ſelfe no wiſer then ſome yt are here, of whoſe feithful myndes ſhe nothing doubteth, but verely beleueth &amp; know legeth that they woulde bee as ſorye of his harme as her owne ſelfe, and yet they woulde haue hym frome her, yf ſhe abyde there.
                  
                     
And we all I thinke bee content that bothe her children bee with her if ſhe came frome thence and bee in ſuche place where they maye bee with theyr honoure. Nowe yf ſhe refuſe in the deliueraunce of hym to folowe the wiſdome of theim, whoſe wiſdome ſhe knoweth, whoſe approbate fidelitee ſhe truſteth: it is eaſye to perceaue that frowardneſſe letteth her, and not feare. But goo to, ſuppoſe that ſhe feareth as who maye let her to feare her owne ſhadowe, the more ſhe feareth to deliuer hym, the more we oughte to feare to leaue hym in her handes, for yf ſhe caſte ſuche fonde doubtes that ſhe feare his hurte, then wyll ſhe feare that he ſhall be fette thence, for ſhe wyll ſoone thynke that yf menne were ſette (whiche God forbydde) on ſo greate a miſchief, the Sanctuarye wyll lytel lette theim whiche ſanctuary good menne as me thinketh myghte withoute ſynne: ſomewhat leſſe regarde then they dooe. Nowe then yf ſhe doubte leaſte he might bee fetched from her, is it not licklye that ſhe will ſende hym ſome where oute of the realme? verely I looke for none other. And I doubte not but ſhe nowe as ſore mindeth it, as we mind the let therof. And if ſhe might hap to bring that purpoſe to paſſe (as it were no great maſtery to doo we letting her alone) all yt world would ſay that we were a ſorte of wyſe councelers aboute a king to let his brother to bee caſt away vnder our noſes. And therfore I enſure you feithfully for my minde, I wyll rather maugre her ſtomacke fetche hym awaye, then leaue hym there tyll her feare or fonde frowarde feare conuey hym awaye, and yet wyll I breake no ſanctuarye, for verely ſithe the

priueledge of that place &amp; other of yt ſorte haue ſo long contynued I woulde not go about to breake yt, but yf they were nowe to begynne I would not be he that ſhoulde make theim, yet wyl not I ſaye nay, but it is a deede of pitie, that ſuch men as the chaūce of y• ſea or theyr euil debters haue brought into pouertee, ſhoulde haue ſome place of refuge to kepe in theyr bodies out of the daūger of theyr cruel credytoures. And yf it fortune the croune to come in queſtion as it hath done before thys time whyle eatch parte taketh other for traytoures, I thyncke it neceſſarye to haue a place of refuge for both. But as for theues and murtherers, whereof theſe places be full, and whyche neuer falle from theyr crafte after they once fall therunto, yt is pytee that euer ſanctuarye ſhoulde ſaue theim, and in eſpecyall wylfull murtherers, whom God commaundeth to be taken from the aulter and to be putte to death. And where it is other wyſe then in theſe caſes, there is no nede of ſayntuaryes, apointed by God in the olde law. For yf neceſſite of his owne defence or myſfortune dryued hym to yt deed then a pardon ſerueth hym, whyche ether is graū
                     ted of courſe, or the kynge of pytee and compaſſyon geueth. Nowe looke howe fewe ſanctuary mē there be whom neceſſyte or myſfortune compelled together? And then ſee on the other ſyde, what a ſorte there bee commonlye therin of ſuche, whom wylfull vnthryftines hathe broughte to naughte what a rable of theues, murtherers and malycyous heynous traytours bee, and that in two places ſpecyallye, the one at the elbowe of the cytee, &amp; the other in the very bowels, I dare wel a vowe it

yf you waye the good that they do wyth the hurte that commeth of theim ye ſhall fynde it much better to leſe both, then to haue both. And thys I ſay although they were not abuſed (as they nowe bee and ſo longe haue bene) that I feare me euer they wylbe while men be a feard to ſet to theyr handes to the a mēdement, as though God and ſaynt Peter were the patrons of vngratious lyuing. Now vnthryftes riot, and ronne in debte vpon boldnes of theſe places, yea, and rytch men ronne thyther with poore mens goodes, there they buylde, there they ſpende and byd theyr creditours go whyſtel. Mens wyues ronne thether with theyr huſbādes plate, &amp; ſay they dare not abide with theyr huſbandes for beting, theues bring thether ſtollē goodes &amp; lyue thereon. There deuiſe they newe robberies nightly &amp; ſtele out &amp; robbe, reue, &amp; kyl men &amp; come agayne into thoſe places, as though thoſe places gaue thē not only a ſauegard for the harme yt thei haue done, but a licēce alſo to do more myſchiefe, howbeit, much of this great abuſion, (yf wyſe mē woulde ſet theyr handes thereunto) myghte bee a mended, with great thankes of god and no breche of the priuiledge. The concluſion is, ſythe it is ſo long a go I wote not what pope and what prynce more piteous then polityke, hath graunted it, &amp; other men ſence of a relygious feare haue not broken yt, let vs take a payne with it, &amp; let it ſtande a Goddes name in hys force, as ferforth as reaſon wyl, whyche is not ſo ferfourth as maye ſerue to let vs of the fetchynge forth of thys noble manne to hys honoure and welth out of that place in the whyche nether is nether can be a ſanctuary or priueledged

mā. A ſanctuarye euer ſerueth to defend the bodye of that man that ſtandeth in daungers abrode, not of great hurt only, but of lawful hurt. For agaynſt vnlawful hurtes &amp; harmes no pope ner kynge entended to priueledge anye one place wherin it is lawful for one man to do another mā wrong. That no man vnlaufully take hurte, that lybertye the kynge, the lawe and verye nature for biddeth in euery place and maketh to that regard for euery man euery place a ſanctuarye: but wher a man is by lawful meanes in parel, there nedeth he the tuycion of ſome ſpecyall priueledge, which is the only ground of al ſanctuaries, from which neceſſitee thys noble prince is farre, whoſe loue to his kyng, nature and kynred proueth, whoſe innocentie to al the world, hys tender youth affyrmeth &amp; ſo ſāctuary as for him is not neceſſary ner none he cā haue. Men com not to ſāctuary as they com to baptim to require it by his godfathers, he muſt aſke it him ſelf yt muſt haue it, &amp; reaſon ſith no mā hath cauſe to haue it, but whoſe conſyence of hys own faut maketh him hauened to require it, what wyl thé hath yōder babe, which if he had diſcretiō to require it yf nede wer, I dare ſay wold be right angry wt theim yt kepe him ther. And I wold thīk wtout any ſcruple of conſciēce, wtout any brech of priueledge to be ſōwhat more homly wt them yt be ther ſāctuary mē in ded yt yf one go to ſāctuary wt another mās goodes, why ſhold not ye king leuīg his body at liberty ſatiſfye y• party of his goodes euē win ye ſāctuary, for nether kyng nor pope can geue anye place ſuch a priueledge that it ſhal diſcharge a man of his debtes beynge hable to pay.
                  
                     
And with that dyuerſe of the clergie that were there p̄ſēt, whether thei ſaied it for his pleaſure or as thei thought, agreed plainly by yt lawe of God &amp; of ye churche yt the goodes of a ſanctuary manne ſhould bee delyuered in paymēt of his debtes, and ſtollen goodes to the owner and onely lybertie reſerued to hym to gette his lyuyng with the labour of his handes. Verely ꝙ the duke I thynke ye ſaie very truth. And what if a mannes wife take ſanctuary becauſe ſhe liſt to ronne from hir huſband? I would thinke if ſhe cā alledge none other cauſe he maye laufully without any dyſpleaſure dooen to ſainct Peter, take hir oute of ſainct Peters churche by the arme. And if no bodye maye bee taken oute of ſanctuary becauſe he ſaieth he will abyde there, then if a chylde will take ſanctuary becauſe he feareth to goo to ſchoole, his maſter muſt lette hym alone, and as ſymple as that example is, yet is there leſſe reaſon in oure caſe then in it, for there though it bee a chyldyſhe feare, yet is there at the leaſt ſome feare, and herein is no feare at all And verely I haue heard of ſanctuary menne, but I neuer harde before of ſanctuary chyldren, &amp; ther fore as for the concluſiō of my mynde, whoſo euer maye deſerue to haue nede of it, if thei thinke it for their ſuretye let theim kepe it, but he can bee no ſāctuary manne that hath nother diſcreſion to deſire it, ner malice to deſerue it, whoſe life ner lybertie can by no laufull proceſſe ſtande in ieoperdie, and he that taketh one oute of ſanctuarye to dooe hym good, I ſaye plainlye he breaketh no ſanctuarye.
                  When the duke had dooen, the temporall mēne wholy, and the mooſte parte of the ſpirituall mēne

alſo thynke no hurte earthely mente towarde the baby, condiſcended in effecte, that if he were not delyuered he ſhould bee fetched out. Howbeit thei thought it beſt in aduoydyng of all maner of rumoure, that the cardynall ſhould firſt aſſaye to gette hym with her good will. And therupon all the counſaill came to the ſtarre chamber at Weſtmynſter, and the cardinall leauyng the protectour and other lordes in the ſterre chaumber departed into the ſanctuarie to the quene accompaignied wt certain lordes, were it for yt reſpecte of his honour or that ſhe ſhould by the perſonnes of ſo many perceaue that his arrande was not onely one mānes mynde, or were it for that the protectoure entended not in this matter to truſt one manne alone, or els if ſhe finally were determined to kepe hym, ſome of the compaignie had paraduenture ſome ſecrete inſtrucciō incontinēt maugre her will to take hym and to leaue her no reſpyte to conueigh hym.
                  When the quene and the lordes were come together in preſence, the Cardynall ſhewed vnto her that it was thought to the lord protectour and the whole caunſaill yt hir kepyng of yt kynges brother in that place highly ſoūded, not onely to yt grudge of the people and their obloquy, but alſo to the unportable greefe and diſpleaſure of yt kyng his royall maieſtie, to whoſe grace it were a ſynguler cō
                     forte to haue his naturall brother in compaignie, and it was their bothes diſhonoures and theirs &amp; hirs alſo to ſuffre hym in ſanctuarye, as though the one brother ſtoode in daungier and perell of the other. And he ſhewed her ferther that the whole counſaill had ſent hym to requyre of her the delyuerye

of hym that he might bee brought to yt kyng his preſence at his libertie oute of yt place whiche meune reconed as a priſone, &amp; there ſhould he bee demeaned accordyng to his eſtate and degree, and ſhe in this doyng ſhould bothe dooe greate good to the realme, pleaſure to the coūſaill, profite to her ſelf, ſuccoure to her frendes that were in deſtreſſe, &amp; ouer yt, whiche he wiſt well ſhe ſpeciallye tendered, not onelye greate conforte &amp; honoure to the kyng but alſo to the younge duke hym ſelf, whoſe bothe greate wealthe it were to bee together, aſwell for many greater cauſes as alſo for their bothe dyſporte &amp; recreacyon, whiche thynges the lordes eſtemed not ſleight, though it ſemed light, well pōde ryng yt their youthe without recreacion and playe cānot endure, ner any eſtraunger for the conueniē
                     cie of bothe their eſtates ſo metely in yt poinct for any of theim as the either of theim for theother.
                  My lorde (ꝙ the quene,) I ſaie not naye but that it were very conueniente yt this gentlemanne whom you requyre were in the compaignie of the kyng his brother, and in good faith me thynketh it were as greate commodite to theim bothe, as for yet a while to bee in the cuſtodie of their mother the tendre age conſydered of the elder of theim bothe, but in eſpeciall the younger, whiche beſydes his infancye that alſo nedeth good lookyng too, hath awhyle been ſo ſore deſeaſed with ſyckeneſſe and is ſo newlye rather a lytle amended then well recouered, that I dare putte no perſone earthely in truſt wt his kepyng, but my ſelf onely, conſyderyng there is as phiſicians ſaie, and as we alſo fynde) double yt perell in the reſylynacion yt was in

the firſt ſyckeneſſe, with whiche deſeaſe nature beyng ſore laboured, forweried &amp; weaked, waxeth the leſſe hable to bear oute a newe ſurfett
                        〈…〉
                      And albeit there might bee foūden other that would happely dooe their beſt vnto hym, yet is there none yt ether knoweth better howe to ordre hym then I yt ſo lōg haue kepte hym, or is more tendrely like to cheriſhe hym then his owne mother yt bare hym. No māne denieth good madame (ꝙ y• cardinall) but yt your grace of all folke were mooſt neceſſarie aboute your chyldrē, &amp; ſo would all yt coūſaill not only bee content but alſo glad y• it were if it might ſtand wt your pleaſure to be i ſuche place as might ſtāde wt their honour. But if you apoinct your ſelf to tarie here, thē thynke thei it more cōueniēt the Duke of Yorke were with yt kyng honorably at his lybertie to the cōforte of theim bothe, then here as a ſanctuary māne to their bothe diſhonoure and obloquy, ſith there is not alwaie ſo greate neceſſite to haue yt childe with the mother, but that occaciō ſometyme maye bee ſuche that it ſhould bee more expediēt to kepe hym els where, whiche in this well apereth, yt at ſuche tyme yt your mooſt dereſt ſoonne thē prince &amp; nowe kyng ſhould for his honour &amp; good ordre of the countre kepe houſhold in Wales farre out of your kepyng, your grace was well cōtent therwt your ſelf. Not very well content (ꝙ the quene) &amp; pet the caſe is not like, for theone was then in helth &amp; theother is nowe ſicke, in whiche caſe I meruell greatly why my lord protectour is ſo deſierous to haue hym in his kepyng, where if the childe in his ſickeneſſe miſcaried by nature, yet might he rōne into ſlaunder and ſuſpicion of fraude. And thei

call it a thyng ſo ſore againſt my childes honoure and theirs alſo that he abideth in this place, it is all their honoures there to ſuffre hym abide wher no manne doubteth he ſhalbe beſt kepte, and that is here while I am here, whiche as yet entend not to come foorth and ieopard my ſelfe after other of my frēdes, whiche would God were rather here in ſuertie with me, then I were there in ieoperdie wt theim. Why Madame (ꝙ ye lord Hawarde) knowe you any thyng why thei ſhould bee in ieopardie? Naye verely (ꝙ ſhe,) nor why thei ſhould bee in priſone neither as thei nowe bee, but I trowe, it is no greate maruell though I feare leaſte thoſe yt haue not letted to put theim in duraunce wt out coloure, will let as litle to procure their diſtrucion without cauſe. The cardinall made a countenaunce to the lord Haward that he ſhould harpe no more vpon yt ſtryng, and thē ſaied he to the quene, yt he nothyng doubted but thoſe lordes of her kynne the whiche remeyned vnder a reſt ſhould vpon the matter 
                        •
                     ramined dooe well ynough, and as toward her noble perſone, was, neither could bee any maner of ieopardie. Wherby ſhould I truſte that (ꝙ yt quene) in yt I am guyltleſſe, as though thei were guyltie, in yt I am with their enemies better beloued then thei, whē thei hate theim for my ſake, in that I am ſo nere to the kyng, and howe ferre bee thei of that would helpe, as God ſēde grace thei hurt not. And therfore as yet I purpoſe not to departe hence, as for this gentlemanne my ſoonne, I minde he ſhall be wher I am till I ſe further, for I ſe ſome mēne ſo gredy whthout any ſubſtanciall cauſe to haue hym, whiche maketh me muche more afrayd and

ſcrupulous to delyuer hym. Truly madame (ꝙ the cardynall) the more afrayde that ye bee to delyuer hym, the more other menne feareth to ſuffre you to kepe hym, leaſte youre cauſeleſſe feare, mighte cauſe you farther to conueye hym, &amp; many thynke he can here haue no pryuiledge whiche can haue neyther wyll to aſke it, nor yet malyce or offence to nede it. And therfore, they recon no priuiledge broken, although they fetche hym out of ſanctuarye, whiche yf you fynallye refuſe to delyuer hym, I thynke verely ye councel wil enfrauncheſe hym, ſo muche drede hathe my lorde his vncle, for the tēdre loue he beareth hym, leaſt your grace ſhould ſende hym awaye. Ah (ꝙ the quene) hath he ſo tendre a zele to hym that he feareth nothyng, but leaſt he ſhould eſcape hym? Thynketh he that I would ſende hym hence, whiche is neyther in the plight to ſende oute? and in what place coulde I recone hym ſure, if he bee not ſure in ſanctuarye? whereof was there neuer tyraunte yet ſo deuelyſhe, that durſte attempte to breake the priuiledge, and I truſte God is nowe as ſtronge to wythſtande his aduerſaries as euer he was. But my ſoonne can deſerue no ſanctuarye (you ſaye) and therfore he cannot haue it, forſothe the lorde protectoure hath ſente a goodly gloſe, by the whiche that place that may defend a theſe may not ſaue an innocent: but he is in no ieopardye nor hath no nede thereof, I woulde God he had not. Troweth the protectoure I praye God he maye proue a protectour, rather then a deſtroyer, whereunto his peynted proceſſe draweth. Is it not honourable that the duke byde here? it were confortable to theim bothe that he

were with his brother, becauſe the kyng lacketh a playe feloe, yea bee you ſure, I praye God ſende hym better playefelowes then hym that maketh ſo hyghe a matter vpon ſuche a tryfleynge pretexte, as though there coulde none bee founde to playe with the kynge, but yf his brother whiche hathe no lu
                        〈…〉
                      to playe for ſyckeneſſe, muſte come oute of Sanctuarye, oute of his ſauegarde to playe with hym, as though that prynces ſo young as they be
                        •
                     , coulde not playe without their peres, or chyldrē coulde not playe without theyr kynred, with whome for the more parte they agree muche woorſſe then with ſtraungiers. But the chyld you ſaye cannot require the priuiledge, who tolde the protectoure ſo? Aſke hym and you ſhall here hym aſke it and ſo ſhall he if ye wyll. Howebeit this is a ſtraunge matter, ſuppoſe he coulde not aſke it and thynke he woulde not aſke it, and ymagene he woulde aſke to go oute, yf I ſaye he ſhall not. Note if I aſke the priuiledge, but for my ſelfe, I ſaye that he that agaynſt my wyll taketh out hym, breaketh Sanctuarye. Serueth thys lyberty for my perſonne onlye or for my goodes too? you maye not frome hence take my horſſe frome me, yf I ſtale hym not nor owe you nothynge, then foloweth it, that you maye not take my chylde from me, he is alſo my ward, for as farre as my learned councell ſheweth me, he hath nothyng by dyſſente holden by knyghtes ſeruage, but by ſocage, then the lawe maketh me his garden, then maye no manne lawfully (I ſuppoſe) take my warde frome me oute of thys place, wythoute the breche of

Sanctuarye, and yf my pryuyledge coulde not ſerue hym, nor he aſke it for hym ſelfe, yet ſythe the lawe commytteth to me the cuſtodye of hym, I maye requyre it for hym, excepte the lawe geue the infaunte a garden onelye for hys gooddes, dyſchargynge hym of the cure and ſauekepynge of his bodye, for whiche onely, bothe goodes and landes ſerue. Wherfore here entende I to kepe hym, ſithe mannes lawe ſerueth the garden to kepe the infaunte, and the lawe of nature wylleth the mother to kepe yt chyld, and Goddes lawe priuiledgeth the Sanctuarye, and the Sanctuarye pryuyledgeth my ſoonne, ſythe I feare to putte hym to the protectoures handes, that hathe his brother already, whiche is (yf bothe fayled) inheritoure to the croune as heyre male, as he ſayth. The cauſe of my feare no man hath to dooe to examen, and yet feare I no further then the law feareth, whiche as learned menne tell me, forbyddeth euery manne the cuſtody of theim, by whoſe death he maye enheryte leſſe lande then a kyngdome, I can ſaye no more, but whoſoeuer he bee that breaketh this holy ſanctuary, I praye God ſende hym ſhortelye nede of Sanctuary, when he maye not come to it, for I woulde not that my mortall enemie ſhould be taken out of Sanctuary.
                  The Cardynal perceaued that the quene euer yt lenger the farther of, and alſo that ſhe beganne to kyndle and chafe and ſpake ſore bytynge woordes agaynſt the protectoure, and ſuche as he neyther beleued &amp; alſo was lothe to here, he ſayd to her, for a finall concluſion, that he would no more diſpute

the matter, and if ſhe were contente to delyuer the duke to hym and to the other lordes there preſent, he durſte laye his owne bodye and ſoule bothe in pledge, not onlye for his ſuretie, but alſo for hys eſtate, and ſurely he knewe nor ſuſpected no cauſe but he might ſo dooe (but he knewe not all.) And further he ſaide, if ſhe would geue hym a reſolute aunſwere to the contrarye he would therewith departe incontinent, and ſhifte who ſo woulde wyth this buſyneſſe afterwarde, for he neuer entended further to moue her in the matter, in the whiche he thought that he and all other alſo, ſaue her ſelfe, lacked eyther wytte or truthe. Wytte if they were ſo dull, if they nothyng coulde perceaue what the protectoure entended, and yf they ſhould procure her ſoonne to bee delyuered into his handes, in whome they ſhoulde perceaue towardes the chyld any euell wyll entended, then ſhe myghte thynke all the councell bothe euel aduyſed and of lytle fydelyte to theyr prince.
                  The quene with theſe wordes ſtoode in a great ſtudye, and foraſmuche as ſhe ſawe the lord Cardynall more redyer to departe then the remanaūt, and the protectoure hym ſelfe redye at hande, ſo that ſhe verelye thought that ſhe coulde not kepe hym there, but he ſhoulde bee incontynente taken thence, and to conueye hym elles where, neyther had ſhe tyme to ſerue her, nor place determyned, nor perſonnes appoynted to conueygh hym, and ſo all thyng was vnreadye, when this meſſage came ſo ſodenly on her, nothyng leſſe lookyng for then to haue hym out of ſanctuarye, whiche ſhe knewe nowe menne to bee ſet in all places about

that he coulde not bee conueyghed oute vntaken, and partely as ſhe thought, it myghte fortune her feare to bee falſe: ſo well ſhe wiſt it was ether nede leſſe or boteleſſe. Wherfore, yf ſhe ſhould nedes go from hym, ſhe demed beſt to deliuer hym, &amp; ſpecially of yt Cardinalles faith ſhe nothing doubted nor of ſome other lordes whome ſhe ſawe there, which as ſhe feared leaſt, they might be deceaued, ſo well was ſhe aſſured yt they woulde not bee corrupted, then thoughte ſhe that it woulde make theim the more warely to looke to hym, and the more circum ſpectly to ſee his ſurety, yf ſhe with her owne handes betooke hym theim by truſte, and at the laſte ſhe tooke the young duke by the hande and ſaied vnto the Lordes, my Lorde ꝙ ſhe and all my lordes, nether am I ſo vnwiſe to miſtruſte youre wittes nor ſo ſuſpicyous to miſtruſte your truthes: of which thing I purpoſe to make ſuch a proofe that yf either of bothe lacked in you, might turne both me to greate ſorowe, the realme to muche harme and you to greate reproche. For lo, here is ꝙ ſhe this gentilman, whome I doubte not but I could kepe ſalfe if I would, whatſoeuer any manne ſaye and I doubte not alſo but there bee ſome abrode ſo deedly enemies vnto my bloodde, that yf they wiſte where any of it laye in theyr owne body they woulde lette it oute, we haue alſo experience that the deſyre of a kingdome knoweth no kynred, the brother hath bene the brothers bane, and may the nephewes bee ſure of the vncle? eache of theſe children are others defence whyle they bee a ſunder, and eache of their liues lyeth in others body, kepe one ſalfe and bothe bee ſure, and nothing to bothe

more perylous, then bothe to bee in one place, for a wiſe marchaunt neuer auentureth all his good des in one ſhyp, all this notwithſtanding, here I deliuer hym &amp; his brother in hym to kepe, to your handes, of whome I ſhall aſke theim bothe before God and the worlde. Feithfull you bee and that I wot well, and I knowe you be wyſe and of power and ſtrength if you liſt to kepe hym, for you lacke no helpe of your ſelues, nor nede to lacke no helpe in this caſe, &amp; yf you cannot elles where, then may you leaue hym here. But onely one thing I beſech you, for the truſt that his father putte you in euer and for the truſte that I put you in nowe, that as farre as you thincke that I feare to muche, ye bee well ware that you feare not to lytle. And therwith all ſhe ſaied to yt childe, fare well myne owne ſwete ſoonne, God ſende you good kepyng, let me once kyſſe you or you gooe, for God knoweth whē we ſhall kiſſe together againe, &amp; therwith ſhe kyſſed hym and bleſſed hym and tourned her backe &amp; wepte, gooing her waye, leauyng the poore innocent chylde wepyng as faſte as the mother.
                  When the Cardinall and the other lordes had receaued the younge duke, they brought hym into the ſtarre chaumbre, where yt protectoure tooke hym in his armes and kyſſed hym with theſe wordes, nowe welcome my lorde with all my very hert and he ſaied in yt of likelihode euen as he inwardly thought, and therupon, forthwith brought him to the king his brother into the biſhoppes palaice at Powles, and from thence thorowe the citee honourably into the towre, oute of whiche after that daye they neuer came abrode. Whenne the Protectoure

had bothe the chyldren in his poſſeſſyon, yee and that they were in a ſure place, he then beganne to thryſte to ſee the ende of his enterpriſe and to auoyde all ſuſpicion, he cauſed all the Lordes whiche he knewe to bee feythfull to the kyng to aſſemble at Baynardes caſtell to cōmen of the ordre of the coronacyon whyle he and other of his complyces and of his affinitee at Eroſbyes place contriued the contrary &amp; to make the Protectours kyng, to whiche counſel there were adhibite very fewe, and they very ſecrete. Then beganne here &amp; there ſome maner of muttering amongeſt the people as though all thing ſhould not longe bee well though they wyſte not what they feared nor wherfore: were it, that before ſuche great thinges mennes hertes (of a ſecrete inſtyncte of nature) miſgeueth theim, as yt ſouthwinde ſomtime ſwelleth of hym ſelfe before a tempeſte, or were it that ſome one manne happely perceauing, fylled many men with ſuſpicyon, thoughe he ſhewed fewe menne what he knewe, howbeit, the dealing it ſelfe made to muche on the matter, thoughe the counſayle were cloſe, for lytle and lytle all folke drewe from the towre where the kyng was, and drewe to Croſ byes place, ſo that the Protectoure had all the reſorte, and the kyng in maner deſolate, while ſome made ſuyte vnto theim that had the doyng, ſome of theim were by theyr frendes ſecetely warned, that it myghte happely tourne theim to no good to bee to muche attendaunte on the Kyng withoute the Protectoures apoyntmente, whiche remoued dyuerſe of the kynges olde ſeruauntes frō hym, and ſet newe in theyr romes aboute hym.
                  
                     
Thus many thinges comming together, partly by chaunce and partely by purpoſe, cauſed at length, not cōmon people onely whiche wauer wt the winde, but wiſe menne alſo and ſome Lordes to marke the matter &amp; muſe therupon, in ſo much as the lorde Stanley whiche afterward was erle of Derby wiſely miſtruſted it and ſaied to yt lorde Haſtinges, that he muche miſiyked theſe two ſeueral coūſelles, for while we ꝙ he talke of one matter at yt one place, lytle wot we wherof they talke in the other place. Well ꝙ the Lorde Haſtynges, on my lyfe neuer doubte you, for whyle one man is there whiche is neuer thence, neither can there bee any thing once mynded that ſhoulde ſounde amiſſe towarde me, but it ſhoulde bee in mine eares or it were well oute of their mouthes. This ment he by Cateſby whiche was nere of his ſecret councell, and whome he familyerly vſed in his mooſt weightye matters, putting no manne in ſo ſpeciall truſt as hym, ſith he wiſte well there was no manne to hym ſo muche beholdyng as was this Cateſbye, whiche was a manne well learned in the lawes of this lande, and by the ſpeciall fauoure of the lorde Haſtynges in good authorytee and muche rule bare in the countrees of Leiceſtre and Northampton where yt lorde Haſtinges power laye. But ſurely greate pitie was it that he had not had either more trueth or leſſe wit, for his diſſimulacyon onely, kepte all that myſchiefe vp, in whome yf the lorde Haſtinges had not put ſo ſpecial truſt, yt lord Stanley and he wt diuers other lordes had departed into their coūtrees &amp; broken al ye daunce for many euel ſignes yt he ſawe, which

he now conſtrued al for the beſt, ſo ſurely thought he that there coulde be no harme towarde hym in that counſayle entended where Cateſbye was.
                  And of truth the protectour and the duke of Buckyngham made very good ſembleaunce vnto the lorde Haſtynges and kepte hym muche in theyre compaignie. And vndoubtedlie the protectour loued hym well, and lothe was to haue loſte hym ſauynge for feare leaſt hys lyfe ſhoulde haue quayled theyr purpoſe, for the whyche cauſe he moued Cateſby to proue wyth ſome wordes caſte oute a farre of, whether he coulde thyncke it poſſible to wynne the lorde Haſtynges to theyr part. But Cateſby, whether he aſſayed hym or aſſayed hym not reported vnto hym that he founde him ſo faſt, and heard him ſpeake ſo terrible wordes that he durſt no farther breake, and of a truth the lorde Haſtinges of very truſte ſhewed vnto Cateſby the myſtruſt that other began to haue in the matter. And therfor, he fearyng leaſt theyr mocyons myght wt the lorde Haſtynges haue myniſhed his credence, wherunto only al the matter leaned, procured the protectour haſtly to ryd hym, &amp; muche the rather, for he truſted by hys death to obtayne much of yt rule whyche the lorde Haſtynges bare in hys coū
                     tree, the onelye deſyre whereof, was the thynge that enduced hym to be procurer &amp; one of the ſpecialleſt contriuers of al thys treaſon. Wherupon the lorde protectoure cauſed a counſayle to be ſet at the towre on the frydaye the .xiii. daye of Iune, were was much commonyng for the honourable ſolempnytee of the coronation, of the whyche the tyme appoynted aproched ſo nere that the pageaū
                     tes

were a making day &amp; nyght at Weſtminſter &amp; vytayle kylled which afterwarde was caſt awaye
                  Theſe lordes thus ſittyng commoning of this matter, the protectoure came in emong thē about ix. of the clocke ſalutynge theim curteouſly excuſynge hym ſelfe that he had bene frome theim ſo longe, ſaiynge merely that he had bene a ſſeper yt daye. And after a lytle talkynge wyth theym he ſayd to the biſhop of Ely, my lorde you haue very good ſtrawberies in your garden at Holborne, I requyre you let vs haue a meſſe of theim. Gladly, my lorde ꝙ he, I would I had ſome better thyng as redy to youre pleaſure as that, and wyth that he ſente his ſeruaunte in al the haſte for a dyſh of ſtrawberyes. The protectoure ſet the lordes faſte in commonynge and thereupon prayed theim to ſpare hym a lytle, and ſo he departed and came in agayn betwene. x, and .xi. of the clocke into the chā
                     ber al chaunged with a ſowre angry countenaūce knyttynge the browes, frownynge and frettynge and gnawynge on hys lyppes &amp; ſo ſet him downe in hys place. All the lordes were dyſmayed &amp; ſore marueyled of thys maner and ſodayne chaunge and what thynge ſhould hym ayle. When he had ſytten a whyle thus he beganne. What were they woorthy to haue that compaſſe and ymagyne the dyſtruccyon of me beynge ſo neare of bloodde to the kynge and protectoure of this hys royal realme? At whyche queſtyon all the lordes ſat ſore aſtonned, muſynge muche by whom thys queſtyon ſhoulde be ment, of whych euery man knewe hymſelfe clere.
                  Then the lord Haſtynges as he that for the familiaritee

that was betwene them, thoughte he myght be boldeſt wyth hym, anſwered &amp; ſayd that they were worthye to bee punyſhed as heyneous traytours what ſo euer they were, and all the other affyrmed the ſame, that is ꝙ he yonder ſorceces my brothers wyfe and other wyth her, meanynge the quene, at theſe wordes manie of the lordes were ſore abaſhed whyche fauoured her, but the lorde Haſtynges was better contente in hys mynde that it was moued by her then by anye other that he loued better, albeit hys hearte grudged that he was not afore made of councel in this matter as well as he was of the takynge of her kynred and of theyr puttynge to deathe, whyche were by hys aſſente before deuiſed to be behedded at Pomfrete, thys ſelfe ſame daye, in the whyche he was not ware ye it was by other deuyſed that he hym ſelfe ſhoulde the ſame daye be behedded at London: then ſayde the protectoure in what wyſe that ye ſorcereſſe and other of hys counſayle, as Shores wyfe wyth her affynitee haue by theyr ſorcerye and wychcrafte thys waſted my bodye, and therewyth plucked vp hys doublet cleane to hys elbowe on hys lyfte arme, where he ſhewed a weryſhe wythered arme and ſmall as it was neuer other. And thereupon euery mannes mynd myſgaue theim, well perceauynge that thys matter was but a quarell, for well they wyſte that the quene was boothe to wyſe to goo aboute anye ſuche foly, and yf ſhe woulde, yet woulde ſhe of al folke make Shores wyfe leaſte of councel whom of all womenne ſhe moſt hated as that concubin
                        •
                      whom the kyng her huſband moſt loued

Alſo, there was no manne there but knewe that hys arme was euer ſuch ſyth the day of hys byrth Neuertheleſſe the lorde Haſtynges whyche from the death of kyng Edward kept Shores wyfe, on whom he ſomewhat doted in the kynges, lyfe, ſauynge it is ſayd that he forbare her for reuerence towarde hys kynge, or elles of a certayne kynd of fydelitee towarde hys frende. Yet nowe his heart ſomwhat grudged to haue her whom he loued ſo hyghly accuſed, and that as he knewe wel vntrulye, therefore he aunſwered and ſayde, certaynlye my lord, yf they haue ſo doone, they be worthie of heynous ponyſhemente, what ꝙ the protectoure, thou ſerueſt me I wene wyth yf, and wyth and, I tell the they haue doone it, and that I wyll make good on thy bodye traytoure. And therewith (in a greate anger) he clapped his fyſte on the boorde a great rappe, at whych token geuen one cryed treaſon withoute the chamber, and therewyth a doore claped, and in came ruſhing men in harneyes as many as the chamber coulde holde. And anone yt protectoure ſayd to the lorde Haſtynges, I arreſt the traytoure, what me lord ꝙ he? yea the traitour ꝙ the protectour. And one let flye at the lord Stā
                     ley, whyche ſhroncke at the ſtroake and fell vnder the table, or elles his hed had bene cleft to the teth for as ſhortly as he ſhrancke, yet ranne the blood aboute hys eares. Then was the archebyſhoppe of Yorke and doctoure Morton byſhoppe of Ely and the lorde Stanleye taken and dyuers other whyche were beſtowed in dyuers chambers, ſaue the lorde Haſtynges (whome the protectoure commaunded to ſpede and ſhryue hym apace) for by

ſaint Poull (ꝙ he) I will not dyne till I ſe thy hed of, it booted hym not to aſke why, but heuilie he tooke a preeſte at auenture &amp; made a ſhorte ſhrift, for a lenger would not bee ſuffred, the protectoure made ſo muche haſte to his dyner, whiche might not goo to it till this murther were dooen for ſauing of his vngracious othe. So was he brought foorth into the grene beſide the chapell within the towre, and his hed layde dowe on a logge of tymber that laye there for buyldyng of ye chapell, and there tyrannouſly ſtryken of, and after his bodye &amp; hed were enterred at Wyndeſore by his mayſter kyng Edward the fourth, whoſe ſoules Ieſu pardon, Amen.
                  A merueleous caſe it is to here, either the warnynges that he ſhould haue voyded or the tokens of that he could not voyde. For the next nyght before his deathe, the lorde Stanley ſent to hym a truſty meſſenger at mydnight in all the haſt, requiryng hym to ryſe and ryde awaye with hym, for he was diſpoſed vtterlye no lenger for to abyde, for he had a fearfull dreame in the whiche he thought that a bore with his tuſkes ſo raſed theim bothe by the heddes that the bloodde ranne aboute bothe their ſhoulders, and for aſmuche as the protectour gaue the bore for his cogniſaunce, he ymagened that it ſhould bee he. This dreme made ſuche a fearfull impreſſiō in his hearte, yt he was throughly determined no lēger to tarye but had his horſſo readie, if the lord Haſtynges would goo with hym So that thei would ryde ſo ferre that night, that thei ſhould bee oute of daungere by the next daye. A good lord (ꝙ the lord Haſtynges) to the meſſenger,

leaneth my lord thy maſter ſo muche to ſuche trifles and hath ſuche faith in dreames, whiche either his awne feare fāteſieth, or doo riſe in yt nightes reſt by reaſon of the dayes thought. Tell hym it is plaine witchcraft to beleue in ſuche dreames, whiche if thei were tokens of thynges to come, why thynketh he not yt we might as likely make theim true by our goyng if we were caught and brought backe (as frendes fayle flyers) for then had the bore a cauſe lykely to race vs with his tuſkes, as folkes that fled for ſome falſhed, wherfore either is their perell, nor none there is deede, or if any bee, it is rather in goyng then abydyng. And if we ſhould nedes fall in perell one waye or other yet had I leuer that menne ſhould ſe it were by other mennes falſhed, then thynke it were either our awne faute or faynte and feble heart, and therfore goo to thy maſter and commende me to hym and I praye hym to bee mery and haue no feare, for I aſſure hym, I am aſſured of yt māne he wotteth of as I am of myne owne hande. God ſende grace (ꝙ the meſſenger,) and ſo departed. Certen it is alſo that in rydyng toward the towre theſame mornyng in whiche he was behedded, his horſſe that he accuſtomed to ryde on ſtombled with hym twiſe or thriſe almoſt to the fallyng, whiche thyng although it happeneth to theim daylye to whom no myſchaunce is towarde, yet hath it been as an olde eiuill token obſerued as a gooyng toward myſchief. Nowe this yt foloweth was no warnyng but an enuyous ſcorne, theſame mornyng ere he were vp from his bed where Shores wife laye wt hym all night, there came to hym ſir Thomas Hawarde

ſoonne to the lorde Hawarde (the whiche ſturryng that mornyng very earlye) as it were of courteſie to accompaignie hym to the counſaill, but foraſmuche as the lorde Haſtynges was not readye, he taried awhile for hym and haſted hym awaye.
                  This ſir Thomas, while the lorde Haſtynges ſtayed awhile commonyng with a preeſt whom he met in the towre ſtrete, brake the lordes tale, ſaiyng to hym merely, what my lord I praye you come on, wherfore talke you ſo long with that preeſt, you haue no nede of a preeſt yet, and laughed vpon hym, as though he would ſaie, you ſhall haue nede of one ſone. But lytle wiſt the other what he meant (but or night theſe woordes were well remembred by theim that heard theim) ſo the true lorde Haſtynges litle miſtruſted, and was neuer merier, ner thought his life in more ſuretye in all his dayes, whiche thyng is often a ſygne of chaunge, but I ſhall rather lette any thyng paſſe me then the vayne ſuretye of mannes mynde ſo nere his deathe: for vpon the towre wharffe, ſo nere the place where his hedde was of ſo ſone after, as a manne might well caſt a balle, a purſyuan̄t of his awne called Haſtynges mette wt hym, &amp; of their metyng in ye place he was put in remembraūce of another tyme, in whiche it had happened theim to mete before together in ye ſame place, at whiche tyme ye lord Haſtynges had beē accuſed to kyng Edward by yt lord Ryuers the quenes brother, in ſomuche yt he was for awhile which laſted not long highly in yt kynges indignacion &amp; ſtode in great feare of hymſelf, &amp; foraſmuch as he nowe

met theſame purſyuaunt in theſame place the ieopardy ſo well paſſed, it gaue hym greate pleaſure to talke with hym therof, wt whō he had talked in theſame place of that matter, and therfore he ſaied Ah Haſtynges, arte thou remembred when I met the here once with an heuy herte? Ye my lord (ꝙ he) that I remembre well, and thanked bee God thei gatte no good ner you no harme therby, thou woldeſt ſaie ſo (ꝙ he) if thou kneweſt ſo muche as I dooe whiche fewe knowe yet, and mo ſhall ſhortly, that meant he that the erle Ryuers and yt lord Richard and ſir Thomas Vaughm̄ ſhould yt daye bee behedded at Pomfrette, as thei were in deede, whiche acte he wyſt well ſhould bee dooen, but nothyng ware that yt axe honge ſo nere his owne hed. In feith manne (ꝙ he) I was neuer ſo ſorye ner neuer ſtoode in ſo greate daungier of my life as I did when thou and I mette here, and loe the worlde is turned nowe, nowe ſtande myne enemies in the daungier as thou mayſt happe to heare more hereafter, and I neuer in my life meryer nor neuer in ſo greate ſuertie, I praye God it proue ſo (ꝙ Haſtynges proue ꝙ he? dowteſt thou that,) naye naye I warraunt the, and ſo in maner dyſpleaſed he entered into the towre, where he was not long on lyue as you haue hearde. O lord God the blyndeneſſe of our mortall nature, when he mooſte feared, he was in mooſt ſuretie, and when he reconed hym ſelf mooſt ſureſt, he loſte his life &amp; yt within .ii. houres after. Thus ended this honorable manne a good knight and a gentle, of great autorite wt his prīce, of liuyng ſomewhat diſſolute plain and open to his enemie, and ſure and ſecrete

to his frende, eaſye to beguyle, as he that of good herte and courage foreſawe no perelles, a louyng manne and paſſyng welbeloued, verye faythfull &amp; truſtie ynough, but truſtyng to much was his deſtruccion as you maye perceaue.
                  Nowe flewe the fame of this lordes death thorough the cytie and farther about like a wynde in euery mannes eare, but the protectoure immediatly after dynner (entendynge to ſet ſome coloure vpon the matter) ſent in all the haſt for many ſubſtanciall menne out of the cytie into the towre, and at their commynge, hym ſelfe wyth the duke of Buckyngham ſtoode harneſſed in olde euell fauoured bryganders▪ ſuche as no manne woulde wene that they would haue voucheſalued to haue putte on their backes, excepte ſome ſodeyne neceſſitee had conſtreigned theim. Then the lorde protectoure ſhewed theim, that the lorde Haſtynges and other of his conſpyracye hadde contryued to haue ſodenly deſtroyed hym and the duke of Buckyngham there theſame daye in councell, &amp; what they entended farther, was as yet not wel knowen of whiche their treaſon he had neuer knowledge before ten of the clocke theſame fornoone, whiche ſodeyne feare draue theim to put on ſuche harneſſe as came nexte to theyr hādes for their defence, &amp; ſo God holpe theim, that the miſchiefe turned vpon theim that would haue done it, and thus he required theim to reporte. Euerye manne aunſwered fayre, as thoughe no manne myſtruſted the matter, whiche of truthe no manne beleued. Yet for the farther appeaſyng of the peoples myndes, he ſent immedyatlye after dynner an Heralde of armes

with a proclamacion through the citee of London whiche was proclamed in the kynges name, that the lord Haſtynges with dyuerſe other of his treyterous purpoſe had before cōſpired, theſame daye to haue ſlain the protectoure and the duke of Buckyngham ſittyng in counſaill, &amp; after to haue takē vpon theim the rule of the kyng and the realme at their pleaſure, and therby to pill and ſpoyle whom thei liſt vncomtrolled, and muche matter was deuiſed in theſame proclamacion to the ſclaunder of the lord Haſtynges, as that he was an eiuill counſaillour to the kynges father, entiſyng hym to many thynges highly redoundyng to the miniſſhyng of his honoure and to the vniuerſall hurt of his realme, by his eiuill compaignie and ſyniſter procuryng and vngracious exſample, aſwell in many other thynges as in vycious lyuyng and inordynate abuſyon of his bodye, bothe with many other and in eſpeciall with Shores wife whiche was one of his ſecrete counſaill of this heynous treaſon, with whom he laye nyghtlye, and namely the nyght paſſed next before his deathe, ſo that it was the leſſe maruell yf vngracyous lyuyng brought hym to an vnhappie ende, whiche he was nowe putte to by the commaundement of the kyng his highnes and of his honourable and faithfull coū
                     ſaill, bothe for his demerytes beyng ſo openly taken in his falſe contriued treaſon, and alſo leaſt the delaiyng of his execucion myght haue encoraged other myſcheuous perſones parteners of his conſpiracye, to gather and aſſemble theim ſelues together in makyng ſo greate commocyon for his delyucraunce, whoſe hope nowe beeyng by hys

well deſerued deathe pollytickelye repreſſed, all the realme ſhall by Goddes grace reſte in good quyet and peace. Nowe was this proclamacion made within twoo houres after he was behedded, and it was ſo curyouſly endited and ſo fayre wrytten in parchement in a fayre ſette hande, and therwith of it ſelfe ſo long aproceſſe, that euery chylde myght perceaue that it was prepared and ſtudyed before (and as ſome menne thought, by Cateſby) for all the tyme betwene hys deathe and the proclamacyon proclaymynge, could ſkante haue ſuffyſed vnto the bare wrytynge alone, albeit that it had been in paper and ſcrybeled foorthe in haſte at aduenture. So that vpon the proclaymynge therof, one that was ſchoolemaſter at Paules ſtandyng by and comparyng the ſhorteneſſe of the tyme wyth the lengthe of the matter ſayed to theim that ſtoode aboute hym, here is gaye goodlye caſt, fowle caſte awaye for haſt. And amarchaunte that ſtoode by hym ſayed that it was wrytten by inſpyracyon and propheſye. Nowe then by and by as yt were for anger and not for coueteous, the protectoure ſent ſir Thomas Hawarde to the hous of Shores wyfe (for her huſbande dwelt not wyth her) whyche ſpoyled her of all yt euer ſhe had, aboue the valure of twoo or thre thouſande markes, and ſente her bodye to pryſon. And the protectoure had laide to her for the maner ſake yt ſhe entended to witche hym, and yt ſhe was a coūſaill wt the lord Haſtynges to deſtroye hym In conclucion, whē no coloure could faſten vpō theſe matters, the he leyed heinouſly to her charge that

thyng that ſhe coulde not denye, for all the worlde knewe that it was true, and that not wythſtandyng euery manne laughed to here it then ſo ſodeynly, ſo highly taken, that ſhe was noughte of her body. And for this cauſe as a Godly continent prince clene and faultleſſe of hym ſelfe, ſent oute of heauen into this vicious worlde, for the amendement of mennes maners, he cauſed the byſhop of London to put her to open penaunce, goynge before a croſſe on ſondaye at proceſſion with a taper in her hande. In the which ſhe went in coūtenaūce and pace ſo womanly, and albeit ſhe was out of al her araye ſauyng her kyrtell onelye, yet wente ſhe ſo fayre and louely, and namelye when the wondryng of the people caſt a comelye rud in her chekes of the whiche ſhe before had moſte myſſe, that her greate ſhame wanne her muche prayſe amongeſt theim that were more amorous of her bodye then curyous of her ſoule, &amp; many good folke that hated her lyuyng and wer glad to ſee ſynne corrected, yet petied they more her penaūce then reioyſed it, whē they conſydred yt the protectour dyd it more of a corrupt mynde then any verteous affeccion.
                  This woman was borne in London, well frended,

Howbeit the reſpect of his royaltee, yt hope of gaye apparel, eaſe, pleaſure

and other wantonne wealthe was hable ſoone to perce a ſofte tender harte, but when the kyng had abuſed her, anone her huſbande being an honeſt manne and one that coulde his good, not preſuming to touche a kynges concubyne lefte her vp to hym all together. When the kyng dyed, yt lorde Haſtynges tooke her, which in the kynges dayes albeit that he was ſore enamoured with her, yet he forbare, either for a pryncelye reuerence or for a certen frendely faythfulneſſe. Propre ſhe was &amp; fayre, nothing in her bodye that you coulde haue chaunged, but if you would haue wiſhed her ſomwhat hygher. This ſaye they that knewe her in her youthe, ſome ſaied and iudged yt ſhe had bene well fauoured, and ſome iudged the contrarye, whoſe iudgement ſemeth lyke as menne geſſe the bewtye of one longe before departed, by a ſcalpe taken oute of a chanell houſe, &amp; this iudgemente was in the tyme of kyng Henry the eyghte, in the xviii. yere of whoſe reygne ſhe dyed, when ſhe had nothing but a reueled ſkynne and bone. Her beautye pleaſed not menne ſo muche as her pleaſaunt behaueoure, for ſhe had a propre wytte and could bothe reade and wryte, mery in compaignye, redy and quicke of aunſwer, nether mute nor full of bable, ſometime taunting withoute diſpleaſure, but not without diſporte. Kyng Edward woulde ſaye that he had thre concubines, which in diuerſe properties diuerſlye excelled, one, the merieſt, yt other the wilieſt, the third the holyeſt harlot in y• realme as one, whom no man could get oute of y• churche to any place lightlye, but yf it were to his bed, the other two were ſomwhat greater perſonages thē

I doubte not but ſome manne wyll thynke this womanne to bee to ſlyghte to bee writen of, amonge graue &amp; weightie matters, whiche they ſhall ſpecially thynke yt happely ſawe her in her age &amp; aduerſite, but me ſemeth yt chaūce ſo much more worthy to be remēbred, in howe muche after welth ſhe f

muche leſſe remembred becauſe they were not ſo euell, for none vſe to wryte an euell turne in marble ſtone, but a good turne they write in the duſte, whiche is not worſte proued by her, for after her welthe ſhe wente begginge of manye that hadde begged theim ſelfes yf ſhe had not holpen theim, ſuche was her chaunce.
                  Nowe was it deuyſed by the protectoure and his counſayle, that the ſame daye that the lorde chaumberlayne was behedded in the towre of Lō

                  Thys knyghte broughte theſe foure perſoonnes to the ſcaffolde at the daye appoynted, and ſhewed to all the people that they were traytoures, notſufferynge the lordes to ſpeake, and to declare theyr innocencye, leaſte their wordes myghte haue inclyned menne to pytie theym and to hate the protectour and hys part, and ſo wyth oute iudgemente and proceſſe of the lawe cauſed

G. duke of Gloucetre, whiche nowe I ſee is he that ſhall &amp; wyll accompliſhe the prophecye and deſtroye kyng Edwardes chyldren &amp; all theyr alyes and frendes, as it appereth by vs this daye, whom I appele to the hygh tribunal of God for his wrongful murder and oure true innocencye, and then Ratclyffe ſaied, you haue well apeled, laye downe your hed, ye ꝙ Syr Thomas, I dye in ryght, beware you dye not in wrong, and ſo that good knight was beheded and yt other .iii. and buried naked in the monaſtery at Pomfret.
                  When the lorde Haſtinges and theſe other lordes and knyghtes were thus behedded &amp; ryd oute of the waye, then the Protectoure cauſed it to bee proclaimed that the coronacyon for dyuerſe great and vrgent cauſes ſhoulde be deferred tyll the ſecond day of Nouembre, for then thought he, that whyle men muſed what the matter ment, &amp; whyle the lordes of the realme were aboute hym, oute of their owne ſtrengthes, and while no manne wyſte what to thynke nor whome to truſte, or euer they ſhould haue tyme and ſpace to digeſt the matter, and make partes, it were beſt haſtely to purſue his purpoſe and put hym ſelfe in poſſeſſyon of the croune, or menne coulde haue tyme to deuiſe any

wyſe to reſyſt. But nowe was all the ſtudye, thys matter beynge of it ſelfe ſo heynous myghte bee fyrſt broken to the people in ſuch wiſe as it might be well taken. To thys counſayle they tooke dyuerſe ſuche as they thoughte metely to be truſted and lykelye to be enduced to that parte and hable to ſtande them in ſtede, ether by powre or by pollycy. Amonge who
                        •
                     e, they made a counſayle Edmounde Shaa then mayre of Londō, whych vpō truſte of his owne auauncement, wher he was of a proude heart, hyghly deſyreous, toke on hym to frame the cyte to theyr appetite. Of ſpirituall mē they tooke ſuche as had wyt and were in auctorytee emongeſt the people for opynion of theyr learnynge and hadde no ſcrupulous conſcyence. Emongeſt theſe, had they tooke Raffe Shaa clerke brother to the Mayre, and Freer Pynkie prouyncyall of the Auguſtyne Freers, both doctoures in diuinitee, both great preachers, both of more learning then vertue, of more fame then learnyng, &amp; yet of more lernyng then truthe. For they wer before greatelye eſtemed emonge the people, but after that, neuer none of theſe two were regarded Shaa made a ſermonde in prayſe of the protectour before the coronacion, and Pynky made one after the coronation, bothe ſo full of tedious flatterye, that no good mans eares coulde abyde thē Pynkye in hys ſermonde ſo loſt hys voyce that he was fayne to leaue of and come downe in the myddeſt. Doctoure Shaa by hys ſermonde loſte hys honeſtye, and ſoone after hys lyfe, for verye ſhame of the worlde, into the whyche he durſt neuer after much come abrode, but the Freer forced

for no ſhame, and ſo yt harmed him the leſſe. How beit, ſome doubte and many thyncke that Pinkey was not of counſayl before the coronation but after the common maner fell to flattery after, namely, becauſe his ſermounde was not incontinente vpon it, but at Saynt Mary Spittle the Eaſtre after. But certayne it is that Doctoure Shaa was of counſayle in the begynnynge, in ſo muche that they determyned that he ſhoulde fyrſt breke the matter in a ſermōd at Paules croſſe, in which he ſhulde by the authorytee of hys preachyng induce the people to enclyne to the protectoures ghooſtly purpoſe. But nowe was all the laboure and ſtudye in the deuyſe of ſome conuenyent pretexte, for whyche the people ſhoulde be contente to depoſe the prynce and accepte the protectoure for kyng. In whyche dyuerſe thynges they deuyſed, but the chiefe thynge and the weyghte of all that inuention reſted in thys, that they ſhoulde alledge baſtardy in kynge Edwarde hym ſelfe, or in his chyldren, or both, ſo that he ſhould ſeme diſabled to enherite the crowne by the duke of yorke and the prynce by hym. To laye baſterdy in king Edward ſounded openly to the rebuke of the protectoures owne mother, which was mother to the bothe. For in that poynte coulde bee none other colour, but to pretend that hys owne mother was an auoutreſſe, but neuertheleſſe he woulde that poynt ſhould be leſſe and more fynely and cloſely handled, not euen fully playne and dyrectlye, but touched a ſlope craftely, as though menne ſpared in that poynte to ſpeake all the truthe for feare of his diſpleaſure. But that other poynt concerning

the baſterdy that they deuyſed to ſurmiſe in king Edwardes children, that woulde he ſhoulde be openly declared and enforced to the vttermoſt. The coloure and pretexte wherof cannot be wel perceaued excepte we report ſome thynges longe before done aboute kynge Edwardes maryages.
                  After king Edwarde the .iiii. had depoſed king Henry the .vi. &amp; was in peaſyable poſſeſſion of the realme, determyning him ſelfe to mary (as was requiſite) both for him ſelf and for the realme, he ſet the earle of Warwike and diuerſe other noble mē in ambaſſade to the Frenche kynge to entreate a maryage betwene yt kyng and Bona ſyſter to the Frenche kyng. In whych the Earle of Warwike founde the parties ſo towarde and wyllinge that he ſpedely wythout anye dyfficultie according to hys inſtruccyons broughte the matter to a good concluſion. Nowe happened yt in the meane ſeaſon, there came to make a ſute to the kynge by petycyon dame Elyzabeth Greye (whyche after was hys quene) then a wyddowe, borne of noble blood ſpecyallye by her mother, whyche was Ducheſſe of Bedforde, and ſhe was maryed to ſyr Rychard Wooduyle, Lorde Ryuers her father.
                  Howebeit, thys Elyzabeth beynge in ſeruyce wyth quene Margarete wyfe to kynge Henrye the ſyxt, was maryed to one Ihon Greye Eſquyre whome kynge Henrye made knyghte at the laſt hattayle of Saynte Albons, but lytle whyle he enioyed hys knyghtehoode for at that feelde he was ſlayne.
                  Afterwarde that kynge Edwarde was kynge &amp; the Earle of Warwyke being on his ambaſſad

this poore ladye made ſute to the kyng to be reſtored to ſuch ſmall landes as her huſbande had geuen her in ioyntour, whom when the kyng beheld and heard her ſpeake, as ſhe was bothe fayre and of a good fauoure, moderate of nature, well made and very wyſe, he not alonlye pytied her, but alſo wexed enamored on her, and takynge her ſecretly a ſyde beganne to enter into talkynge more famylyerly, whoſe apetite when ſhe perceaued, ſhe vertuoſlye denyed him, but that dyd ſhe ſo wyſelye &amp; that with ſo good maner &amp; wordes ſo wel ſet, that ſhe rather kyndled hys deſyre then quenched it. And fynally, after manye a metynge and muche wowynge and manye great promyſes ſhe well eſpyed the kynges affeccyon towarde her ſo greatelye encreaſed that ſhe durſteſomewhat the more boldly ſay her mynde, as to hym whoſe hearte ſhe perceaued more feruently ſet then to fall of for a word. And in cōcluſiō ſhe ſhewed hym playn yt as ſhe wyſt her ſelf to ſīple to be his wife, ſo thought ſhe her ſelfe to good to be hys concubyne. The kyng much maruelyng of her conſtancy, as he yt had not bene wont elles where ſo ſtyfly ſayd nay, ſo much eſtemed her continencye &amp; chaſtitee, that he ſet her vertue in ſtead of poſſeſſiō and rycheſſe. And this taking councel of his owne deſyre determyned in haſt to mary her. And after that he was thus apoīted &amp; had betwene thē twayn ēſured her thē aſked he the coūcel of his ſecret frēdes, &amp; that in ſuch maner yt they myght eaſly perſeaue yt it boted not to ſay nay, Notwythſtandīg, the duches of york his mother was ſo ſore moued ther wt yt ſhe diſwaded yt mariage as much as ſhe poſſible might

Alledgyng that it was his honour, profite &amp; ſuretie to marye in ſome noble progenie oute of the realme, wherupon depended greate ſtrength to his eſtate by that affinitee and greate poſſibilite of encreace of his dominions. And yt he could not well otherwiſe dooe, conſideryng the erle of Warwike had ſo ferfoorth entered into the matter all readie, whiche was not like to take it well if all his voyage were in ſuche wiſe fruſtrate &amp; his apointment deluded. And ſhe ſaied ferther that it was not princely to marye his owne ſubiect, no greater occaciō ledyng therunto, no poſſeſſions nor other commodyte dependyng therupon, but only as a riche mā would mary his maydē onely for a litle wāton dotage vpon her perſone. In whiche maryage many menne commende more the maydens fortune then the mannes wyſedome, and yet ſhe ſaied that there was more honeſtye then honoure in this maryage foraſmuche as there is not betwene a marchaunt and his mayde ſo greate a dyfference as betwene a kyng and his ſubiect, a great prince and a poore wydowe. In whoſe perſone, although there were nothyng to bee miſlyked, yet was there ſaied ſhe, nothyng ſo excellent but that it might bee founde in dyuerſe other that were more metely (ꝙ ſhe) for your eſtate, yee and maydens alſo, the onely wydowhead of dame Elizabeth Grey (although ſhe were in all other pointes and thynges conuenient for you) ſhould ſuffiſe as me thynketh to refrayne you frō her maryage, ſith it is an vnſittyng thyng and a greate blemiſhe to the ſacred maieſtie of a prince that ought as nere to approche preſtehoode in clenneſſe, as he dooth in dignitee, to bee defiled

wt bigamy ī his firſt mariage. The kyng made his mother an aūſwere parte in earneſt &amp; parte in plaiemerely, as he yt wiſt hym ſelf oute of rule, &amp; albeit he would gladly yt ſhe ſhould take it well, yet was he at apoynct in his awne mynde, tooke ſhe it well or otherwiſe. Howbeit, ſomewhat to ſatiſfie her he ſaied, yt albeit maryage beyng a ſpirituall thyng ought rather to bee made for the reſpecte of God where his grace enclineth the parties to loue together (as he truſted it was in his caſe) rather then for yt regard of any tēporall aduaūtage, yet neuer theleſſe hym ſemed this maryage well conſydered not to bee vnprofitable, for he reconed the amytee of no earthely nacion to bee ſo neceſſary for hym as yt frendſhip of his owne, whiche he thought lykely to beare hym ſomuche yt more hartie fauoure in yt he diſdayned not to mary wt one of his awne land, &amp; yet if outward aliaunce were thought ſo requiſite, he would finde ye meanes to enter therunto muche better by other of his kinne where all yt parties could bee contented, then to marye hym ſelfe wherein he ſhould neuer happely loue, &amp; for ye poſſibilite of poſſeſſiōs leſe yt fruyte &amp; pleaſure of this that he had alreadie. For ſmall pleaſure taketh a māne of all yt euer he hath beſyde, if he bee wiued againſt his appetite, and I doubte not (ꝙ he,) but ther be as you ſaie other yt bee in euery poinct comparable with her, &amp; therfore I let not theim yt like theim to mary theim, no more is it reaſon yt it miſlike any manne that I marye where it liketh me. And I am ſure that my couſyn of Warwike, neither loueth me ſo litle, to grudge at yt that I loue, ner is ſo vnreaſonable to look yt I ſhould in choiſe

of a wife rather bee ruled by his yie then by myne owne, as though I were a warde yt were boūdē to mary by a garden. I would not bee a kyng with yt cōdicion to forbeare myne owne libertie in choyſe of myne awne maryage, as for poſſibylyte of more inheritaunce by newe affinite in ſtraūge landes, is ofte yt occaſiō of more trouble thē proffite. And we haue already title by yt meanes, as luſtiſeth to get &amp; kepe well in one mannes daye. That ſhe is a widowe &amp; hath already children. By goddes bleſſed ladye, I am a bacheler &amp; haue ſome too, &amp; ſo eche of vs hath a proofe yt nether of vs is like to be barren. And therfore madame I praie you bee cōtēt, I truſt to God ſhe ſhall bryng foorth a yoūge prince yt ſhall pleaſe you. And as for the bigamy, let the biſſhop hardely laie it to my charge whē I come to take ordres, for I vnderſtād it is forbiddē a preeſt but I neuer wiſt yt it was forbidden a prince. The duches wt theſe woordes nothing apeaſed &amp; ſeyng yt kyng ſo ſet on yt ſhe could not plucke hym backe, ſo highly ſhe diſdeined it, that vnder pretext of her dutye to Godwarde ſhe deuiſed to dyſturbe this maryage, and rather to helpe that he ſhould mary one dame Elizabeth Lucye, whom the kyng not long before had gotten with chylde, wherfore the kyng his mother obiected openlye againſt this maryage (as it were in dyſcharge of her conſcyence) that the kyng was ſure to dame Elizabeth Lucye and her houſbande before God, by reaſon of whiche woordes ſuche obſtacle was made in that matter, that either the byſſhoppe durſte not or the kyng woulde not proceade to the ſolempniſacion of the mariage, till this fame were

clerly purged, and the truth well and openly teſtified) wherupon dame Elizabeth Lucye was ſent for, and albeit ſhe was by the kynges mother and many other put in good comforte to affirme that ſhe was aſſured to the kyng, yet when ſhe was ſolemply ſworne to ſaie the truthe, ſhe confeſſed that thei were neuer enſured. Howbeit ſhe ſaid his grace ſpake ſuche louyng woordes to her, that ſhe verely hoped that he would haue maryed her, and yt if ſuche kynde woordes had not been, ſhe would neuer haue ſhewed ſuche kyndeneſſe to hym, to let hym ſo kyndely to gette her with childe. This examynacion ſolemply taken, it was clerely proued that there was no impedyment to lette the kyng to marye, wherfore he ſhortlye after at Grafton beſide Stonye ſtratforde maryed the ladye Elizabeth Grey verey priuelye, whiche was his enemyes wife and had prayed hartely for his loſſe, in the whiche God loued her better then to graunte her bone, for then had ſhe not been his wife. And alter that ſhe was crouned quene, and her father was created Erle Riuers and her ſoonne created Marques Dorſet. But when the Erle of

whom it ſuffyſeth to haue ſomwhat to ſaye, whyle they were ſure to bee compelled to no larger proffe then theim ſelues lyſt to make.
                  Nowe to retourne where I lefte, as I beganne to ſhewe you, it was by the protectoure &amp; his councell concluded that this doctour Shaa ſhoulde in a ſermond at Paules croſſe ſignifie to the people that neyther kyng Edward hym ſelfe ner the duke of Clarence were lawfullye begotten, nor were the very children of the duke of Yorke, but begotten vnlawfullye by other perſonnes by aduoutrye of the duches theyr mother. And dame Elizabeth Lucye was the very wyfe of kyng Edwarde, &amp; ſo prynce Edward &amp; all the chyldren begotten on the quene were baſtardes. And accordyng to this deuyce, doctor Shaa ye ſōday after at Paules croſſe in a greate audience (as alwaye a greate nombre aſſembled to his preachyng) came into the pulpet takyng for his Theme. Spuria Vitulamina non dabunt radices altos. Sapiencie quarto. that is to ſaye: Baſtarde ſlyppes ſhall neuer take depe rootes, whereupon when he had ſhewed the great grace that God geueth and ſecretlye infoundeth in right generacion after the lawes of matrymony: Then declared he that thoſe chyldren commenlye lacked that grace (and for the punyſhement of their parentes) were for the moſte parte vnhappye whiche were gotten in baſte, and ſpeciallye in aduoutrye, of whiche (thoughe ſome by the ignorauncye of the worlde and the truthe hid from knowledge) haue enheryted for a ſeaſon other mennes landes, yet God alwaye ſo prouydeth that it contynueth not in their bloodde longe, but the truthe commyng to

lyght the rightfull enheritoures be reſtored, and the baſtard ſlyppes plucked vp or it can bee rooted depe. And when he had layd for the proofe and confirmacion of this ſentence, examples taken out of the olde teſtamente and other auncient hiſtoryes, then beganne he to diſcende to the prayſe of lorde Richarde duke of Yorke, callyng hym father of the protectoure: and declared his tytle to the croune by inherytaunce, and alſo by an entayle autoryſed by parliament after the death of kyng Henry the ſyxte. Then ſhewed he that the lorde protectoure was onlye the right heire of his body lawfullye begotten, then declared he that kynge Edward was neuer lawfully maryed to the quene but his wife before God was dame Elizabeth Lucye, and ſo his chyldren were baſtardes. And beſydes that, that neyther kyng Edwarde hym ſelfe nor the duke of Clarence (amongeſt theim yt wer ſecrete in the duke of Yorkes houſhold) were neuer reconed ſurelye to bee the chyldren of the noble duke, as thoſe that by their fauoures more reſembled other knowen menne then hym, from whoſe verteous condicions he ſayde alſo that kyng Edwarde was farre of. But the lorde pretectoure (ꝙ he) that veray noble prince, the ſpecyall patrone of knightly prowes, aſwell in all princely behaueour as in the lyniamentes and fauoure of his vyſage repreſenteth the veraye face of the noble duke his father. This is (ꝙ he) the fathers owne fygure, this is his owne countenaunce, yt very print of his vyſage, the ſure vndoubted ymage, yt playn expreſſe likeneſſe of yt nobble duke. Now was it before deuyſed yt in the ſpeakyng of theſe wordes, the

protectour ſhuld haue come in amongeſt ye people to the ſermond ward, to thende yt theſe woordes ſo metyng with his preſence, might haue bene taken amongeſt the herers, as though the holye ghoſte had put theim in the preachers mouthe, &amp; ſhoulde haue moued the people euen there to haue cryed kyng Richard, that it might haue bene after ſayde that he was ſpecially choſen by God, and in maner by myracle, but this deuyce quayled eyther by the protectoures neglygence or the preachers ouer haſty dilygence. For whyle the protectoure founde by the waye tariynge leaſte he ſhoulde haue preuented theſe woordes, the doctoure fearynge that he ſhoulde come or his ſermon coulde come to thoſe wordes haſtyng his matter thereto, he was come to theim &amp; paſte theim, and entred into other matters or the protectoure came, whome when he behelde cōmyng, he ſodenly left the matter whiche he had in hande, and without any deduccion therunto, out of al ordre and out of all frame beganne to repete thoſe woordes agayne. This is the very noble prince, the eſpecyall patrone of knyghtlye prowes, whyche aſwell in all pryncely behaueoure as in the lyniamentes and fauoure of his vyſage repreſenteth the veraye face of the noble duke of Yorke his father. This is the fathers owne fygure, this is his owne countenaunce, the veraye prynte of his viſage, the ſure vndoubted ymage, the playne expreſſe lykeneſſe of that noble duke, whoſe remembraunce can neuer dye whyle he lyueth. Whyle theſe wordes were in ſpeakynge the protectour accompanyed with the duke of Buckyngham, wente throughe the people vp into the

Frendes, for the zeale and hertie fauoure that we beare you, we be come to breke of a matter ryghte great &amp; weightie, and no leſſe weyghtye then pleaſyng to God and profitable to all the realme, nor to no part of ye realme more proffitable thē to you the cytezens of thys noble cytee. For why, the

thinge that you haue longe lacked and as we welknowe ſore longed for, that you woulde haue geuen greate good for, that you woulde haue gone farre to fetche, that thyng bee we come hether to bring you, withoute youre laboure, payne, coſte, aduentnre or ieopardy. What thing is that? Certes the ſuretie of youre owne bodies, the quiet of youre wiues and doughters and the ſauegard of your goodes. Of all whiche thinges in times paſſed you ſtoode in doubte, for who was he of you al that coulde recone hym ſelfe Lorde of his owne good amongeſt ſo many gynnes and trappes as were ſet therfore, amonge ſo muche pilling &amp; polling, amongeſt ſo many taxes and talliages, of ye which there was neuer ende, and oftimes no nede and yf any were, it grewe either of ryot or of vnreaſonable waſte then any neceſſarye honourable charge, ſo that there was daily plucked and pylled from good and honeſt menne great ſubſtaūce of goodes, to be laſhed oute amonge vnthryftes, ſo farforth that fiftenes ſuffiſed not nor any vſual termes of knowen taxes, but vnder an eaſy name of beneuolence and good will, the cōmiſſioners ſo muche of euery manne tooke, as no manne would with his goo wyll haue geuen. As though yt name of beneuolence had ſignifyed, yt euery man ſhould paye, not what he of hym ſelf of his good will luſt to graūt, but what yt Kyng of his good wyl luſt to take, who neuer aſked lytle, but euery thyng was haunſed aboue the meaſure, amercyamentes turned into fines, fines into raunſomes, ſmall treſpaces into miſpriſion, miſpriſion into treaſō, wher of I thynke that no manne looketh that we ſhall

remēbre of examples by name, as though Burder were forgotten that was for a woorde ſpoken, in haſt cruelly behedded by the miſconſtruing of the lawes of the realme for the princes pleaſure, with no leſſe honoure to Merkam chiefe Iuſtice then (whiche loſte his office rather then he would aſſēt to that iudgement) to the diſhoneſtie of thoſe that other for feare or flatterie gaue that iudgemente: what nede I to ſpeake of Thomas Cooke Aldremanne &amp; maire of this noble cytee, who is of you ether for negligence that wotteth not, or ſo forget full that he remēbreth not, or ſo heard harted that he petieth not that worſhipful mannes loſſe? what ſpeke I of loſſe, his wounderfull ſpoile and vndeſerued diſtruccion, onely becauſe it happed theim to fauoure hym whome the Prince fauoured not. We nede not reherſe of theſe any mo by name, ſith I doubte not yt here bee many preſēt that either in theim ſelfes or their nyghe frendes, aſwell their goodes as perſones were greatly endaungered other by fained quarels or ſmal matters aggreued with heinous names, and alſo there was no crime ſo great of which there could lacke a pretexte. For ſith the king preuenting ye time of his inheritaūce atteined the croune by battail, it ſuffiſed in a riche manne for a pretext of treaſon, to haue been of kinred or aliaunce, nor of familiarite or lenger of acquaintaunce wt any of thoſe, yt wer at any time the kīges enemies, which was at one time or another more then halfe ye realme. Thus were nether your goodes, nether lādes, in ſuerte, &amp; yet they brought your bodies in ieopardie, beſide yt comen aduēture of opē war, which albeit, yt it is euer yt well &amp; occaſion

of much miſchief, yet is it neuer ſo miſcheuous as where any people fal in deuiſiō, &amp; at al diſtaūce among theim ſelues, &amp; in no realme erthly ſo deadly and ſo peſtylēt as when it happeneth amongeſt vs. And among vs neuer continued ſo long diſcē
                     cion nor ſo many batailes in any ſeaſon, nor ſo cruel nor ſo deadly foughtē, as wer in yt kinges daies yt dead is, god forgeue it his ſoule. In whoſe time and by whoſe occaſiō, what about yt getting of the garland, keping it, leſing &amp; winning again, it hath coſte more Engliſh blood then hath the twiſe winning of Fraūce. In which inward war amongeſt our ſelues hath bene ſo great effuſion of y• aunciēt noble blood of this realme, yt ſcacely the halfe remaineth, to ye great enfebling of this nobleland, beſide many a good toune ranſaked &amp; ſpoiled by thē that haue been going to yt feld or retourning from thence, &amp; peace after not much ſurer then war. So that no tyme was there in the which riche men for theyr money, &amp; great men for their landes or ſome other, for ſome feare or for ſōe diſpleaſure wer out of perell. For whom miſtruſted he yt miſtruſted his owne brother? Whom ſpared he yt killed his owne brother? Could not ſuch maner of folke yt he moſte fauoured dooe ſomwhat (we ſhall for his honoure ſpare to ſpeke) howbeit, this ye wote wel all, yt who ſo was beſt bare euer the leaſt rule, &amp; more ſuite in his daies was to Shores wife, a vile &amp; abhominable ſtrompet then to all the lordes in England, excepte vnto thoſe that made her their Protectoure, which ſimple woman was yet wel named &amp; honeſt tyll the Kynge for his luſte and ſynfull affeceyon berefte her from her huſband, a right honeſt man

and ſubſtanciall amongeſt you. And in that point whiche in good fayth I am ſorye to ſpeake of, ſauing that it is vayne to kepe in councell yt thyng that all menne knoweth, the kynges gredy appetite was inſaciable, and euerye where ouer all the realme intollerable. For no womanne was there any where, younge or olde, poore or ryche, whome he ſet his iye vpon, whome he any thing liked eyther for perſone or beautie, ſpeche, pace or countenaunce, but without any feare of God, or reſpecte of his honoure, murmoure, or grudgyng of the worlde, he would importunately purſue his appe tite &amp; haue her, to the great diſtruccion of many a good womanne, and greate doloure to theyr huſbandes and frendes, whiche being honeſt people of theim ſelues, ſo much regarded the clenneſſe of their houſes, the chaſtitee of their wiues and children, that theim were leuer to looſe all yt they haue beſide, then to haue ſuche a vilame done to theim. And albeit that wt this and other importable dealing, ye realme was in euery place anoyed, yet ſpecially you the citezens of this noble citee, as for yt amongeſt you is mooſt plentie of ſuche thinges as miniſter matter to ſuche iniuries, as for yt you wer nereſt hand, ſith yt nere here about was his mooſt cōmon abidyng. And yet bee ye people whome he had as ſynguler a cauſe well and trewelye to intrete, as any parte of his realme, not only for that the Prynce by this noble citee, as of his ſpeciall chaumbre and renoumed citee of this realme, muche honourable fame receaueth amongeſt all other nacyons, but alſo for that, you nowe withoute youre greate coſte and ſondrye fauoures

It ſhal not, I wote well nede, that I reherſed vnto you agayne that you all redy haue hearde of him that can bet ter tell it, and of whom I am ſure ye wyll better beleue it (and reaſon it is that it ſo be) I am not ſo proude to loke therfore, that you ſhoulde receaue my wordes of ſo greate authorytee as the preachers of the worde of God, namely a man ſo connyng &amp; ſo wyſe, that no man wotteth better what he ſhould do &amp; ſay, and thereto ſo good and vertuous that he would not ſay the thynge, which he wyſt he ſhoulde not ſaye in the pulpyt, namely, in to the whiche no honeſte manne commeth to lye: which honourable preacher ye wel remember, ſubſtancyally declared to you at Poules croſſe on ſō daye laſte paſt, the ryght and tytle of the moſt excellent prynce Rychard Duke of Glouceter nowe protectoure of thys hys realme whych he hath vn to the croune of the kingdome of the ſame. For ye worſhipful man made yt perfytely and groundly open vnto you. The chyldren of kynge Edwarde the .iiii. wer neuer laufully begotten, for as much as the kynge (lyuyng hys very wyfe dame Elizabeth Lucy) was neuer laufully maried to ye quene theyr mother, whoſe blood ſauyng he ſet hys volupteous pleaſure before hys honour, was ful vn metely to be matched with his (the mynglyng of

thing I wote wel he wylbe loth to take vpon him as he whoſe wiſdome wel perceueth, ye labour &amp; ſtudy both of mynd &amp; body yt ſhal come ther wt to hī, whoſoeuer ſhal occupy ye rome. I dare ſay he wyl yf he take it (for I warrāte you yt that roome is no childes office) &amp; yt the greate wiſe man wel perceaued whē he ſayd Ve regno cuius rex puer eſt, wo to that realme whoſe king is a chylde wherefore, ſo much more cauſe haue we to thank god yt this noble perſonage, which is ſo righteouſly ētitled therto is of ſo ſad age, &amp; therto of ſo great wiſdome ioyned wt ſo gret experiēce, which albeit, he wylbe loth to take vpon hī, yet ſhal he to our peticiō in ye behalfe ye more graciouſly encline, if ye the worſhipful cytezins of this cite beyng the chefe cite of the realme ioyne wt vs the nobles in our ſayd requeſt, which for your owne weale we doubte not but yt ye wyll. And yet neuertheleſſe, we pray you ſo to do, wherby ye ſhall do great profite to all this his realme. Beſide that, in choſinge then ſo good a kinge, yt ſhalbe to your ſelfe a ſpecial commodite to whom his maieſty ſhal euer after, bear ſo much the more tender fauour, in how much he ſhal perceaue you the more prone and beneuolentlye mynded toward his eleccion, wherin dere frendes, what mynd you haue, we require you playnelye to ſhewe vs? Whē ye duke had ſaid &amp; loked yt the people whom he hoped yt the maire had framed before, ſhould after this flatering p̄poſicion made haue cryed kīg Richard, king Richard, all was ſtyl &amp; mute &amp; not one word anſwered to: wher wt the duke was meruelouſly abaſhed and takyng the Mayre nere to him with other that were about hym preuy to the

matter ſayde vnto theim ſoftelye. What meaneth this that the people be ſo ſtyll? Sir ꝙ the Mayre percaſe they perceaue you not wel, ye ſhal we amēd ꝙ he yf that wyl helpe, &amp; therwith ſomewhat lowder reherſed the ſame matter again, in other ordre &amp; other wordes ſo well and ordinately, &amp; neuertheleſſe ſo euydently &amp; plain, with voyce geſture and countenaunce ſo comely &amp; ſo conuenient, that euery man muche marueiled yt heard hym, &amp; thought that thei neuer hearde in their liues ſo euell a tale ſo well tolde. But wer it for wonder or for other, ye eache loked that other ſhould ſpeake fyrſt, not one worde was there aunſwered of all the people that ſtode before, but all were as ſtyll as the midnight not ſo much as rounyng emong theim, by which they might ſeme once to commen what was beſte to do. When the Mayre ſawe this, he with other parteners of ye councel, drewe about the duke and ſaid yt the people had not bene accuſtomed ther to bee ſpoken to but by the recorder, whyche is the mouth of the citee, &amp; happly to hym they wyl aunſwer. With that the recorder called Thomas Fize William a ſad man &amp; an honeſt, whiche was but newly come to the offyce &amp; neuer had ſpoken to ye people before, &amp; loth was with that matter to begyn, notwithſtanding, therunto commaunded by the Mayre, made reherſall to the cōmons of that which the Duke had twyſe purpoſed hys ſelf but the recorder ſo tempered hys tale, that he ſhewed euery thyng as the Dukes wordes were, and no parte of his owne, but all this no chaūge made in the people, whych alwaye after one ſtoode as thei had bene amaſed. Whereupon the Duke rouned

with the mayre and ſaid, this is a marueleous obſtynate ſcylence, and therwith turned to the people again wt theſe woordes. Deare frendes, we come to moue you to that thyng whiche paraduenture we ſo greatly neded not, but that the lordes of this realme and commōs of other parties might haue ſufficed ſauyng ſuche loue we beare you, and ſo muche ſet by you that we would not gladly dooe with oute you, that thyng in whiche to bee parteners is your weale and honoure whiche as to vs ſemeth you ſe not or waye not. Wherfore we require you to geue vs an aūſwer one or other, whether ye bee mynded as all the nobles of the realme bee, to haue this noble prince nowe protectoure to bee your kyng? And at theſe woordes the people beganne to whiſper emong theim ſelfes ſecretlye, that the voyce was nether lowde nor baſe, but like a ſwarme of bees, till at the laſt at the nether ende of the halle a buſhement of the dukes ſeruauntes and one Naſhfeelde and other belongyng to the protectoure with ſome prentices and laddes that thruſted into the halle emongeſt the preace, began ſodenly at mennes backes to crye, kyng Rychard, kyng Rychard, and there threwe vp their cappes in token of ioye, and thei that ſtoode before caſte their heddes maruelyng therat, but nothyng thei ſaied. And when the duke and the mayre ſawe this maner thei wiſely turned it to their purpoſe, and ſaied it was a goodly crye &amp; a ioifull to here euery manne with one voyce and no māne ſaiyng naye. Wherfore frendes (ꝙ the duke,) ſith we perceaue that it is all your whole myndes to haue this noble manne for your kyng, wherof we ſhall make

his grace effectuall report yt we doubte not but yt it ſhall redounde to your great wealth &amp; cōmodite. We therfore requier you yt to morowe ye go with vs &amp; we wt you to his noble grace to make humble peticiō &amp; requeſt to hym in maner before remē

And therwith the lordes came downe and ye cōpaignie diſſolued &amp; departed the more parte all ſad, ſome with glad ſembleaunce ye were not verye merie, and ſome of theim yt came with the duke, not hable to diſſemble their ſorowe, were faine euen at his backe to turne their face to the wall, while the doloure of their heartes braſt oute of their y

                  Then on the morowe the mayre &amp; aldremen and chief commoners of ye citee in their beſt maner appareled, aſſēblyng theim together at Paules, reſorted to Baynardes caſtel where ye ꝓtectour laye, to whiche place alſo accordyng to ye apointement repaired ye duke of Buckynghm̄ &amp; dyuerſe nobles wt hym, beſydes many knightes &amp; gētlemen. And therupon yt duke ſent woord to ye lord protectoure of ye beyng there of a great honourable cōpaignie to moue a great matter to his grace. Wherupon y• protectoure made great difficultie to come downe to theim, excepte he knewe ſome part of their errād as though he doubted &amp; partly miſtruſted the commyng of ſuche a noumbre to hym ſo ſodenly, wtout any warning or knowledge, whether thei came for good or harme Thē when ye duke had ſhewed this to ye mayre &amp; other, that thei might therby ſe howe litle the protectoure looked for this matter, thei ſēt again by yt meſſenger ſuche louyng meſſage, &amp; ther wt ſo humblie beſought hym to voucheſalue yt thei might reſorte to his preſence to purpoſe their entēt

of which thei would to none other perſone diſcloſe, at the laſt he came oute of his chaūbre, and yet not downe to theim, but in a galary ouer theim wt a biſhop on euery hād of him, where thei beneth might ſe hym &amp; ſpeake to hym, as though he would not yet come nere theim till he wiſt what thei meant. And therupō the duke of Buckynghm̄ firſt made hūble peticiō to him on ye behalfe of theim all, yt his grace would pardone theim &amp; licence theim to purpoſe vnto his grace thētent of their cōmyng wtout his diſpleaſure, wtout whiche ꝑdone obteined, thei durſt not bee ſo bold to moue hym of yt matter. In whiche, albeit thei meant aſmuche honoure to his grace as wealth to al ye realme beſide, yet were thei not ſure howe his grace would take it, whom thei would in no wiſe offende. Then ye protectour, as he was verie gentle of hym ſelf &amp; alſo lōged ſore apparaūtly to knowe what thei meāt, gaue him leaue to purpoſe what hym liked truſtyng for ye good mind yt he bare theim all none of theim any thing would entend to hymward wherwt he thought to bee greued. Whē ye duke had this leaue &amp; pardō to ſpeake thē wexed he bold to ſhewe hym their entent &amp; purpoſe, wt all ye cauſes mouyng theim therto as ye before haue hearde. And finally to beſeche his grace ye it would like him of his accuſtomed goodneſ

leſſe pain, in that that neuer prince reigned vpon any people that were ſo glad to liue vnder his obeyſaunce as the people of this realme vnder his.
                  When the protectoure had hearde the prepoſicion, he looked very ſtrangely thereat and made aunſwer that albeit he knewe partely the thynges by theim alledged to be true, yet ſuche entiere loue he bare to kyng Edward and his children, and ſo muche more regarded his honoure in other realmes aboute, then the croune of any one, of whiche he was neuer deſyrous, ſo that he could not fynde in his hearte in this poincte to incline to their deſyre, for in all other nacions were ye truthe not well knowē, it ſhould paraduenture be thought that it were his owne ambicious mynde and deuice to depoſe the prince and to take hym ſelf ye croune, with whiche infamye he would in no wiſe haue his honoure ſteyned for any croune, in whiche he had neuer perchaunce perceaued muche more laboure &amp; pain then pleaſure to hym that ſo would vſe it, as he that would not and were not worthy to haue it. Notwithſtandyg, he not only perdoned theim the mocion that thei made hym, but alſo thāked theim for ye loue and hartie fauoure thei bare hym, praiyng theim for his ſake to beare the ſame to ye prince vnder whome he was and would bee contente to liue and with his laboure and coūſaill as ferre as it ſhould like the kyng to vſe it, he would dooe his vttermoſt deuoyre to ſette ye realme in good eſtate whiche was all readye in the tyme of his protectourſhip (lauded bee God,) well begonne, in that ye malice of ſuche as were before the occaſion of the contrarie and of newe entended to bee, were nowe

                  Vpon this aunſwer geuen, the duke of Buckyngham by the protectoures licence a lytle rounded, aſwell with other noble menne about hym as with the mayre and recorder of Londō. And after that (vpon like perdon deſyred &amp; opteyned) he ſhewed alowde vnto the protectour, for a fynall concluſion that the realme was apoynted that kyng Edwardes lyne ſhoulde no lenger reygne vpon theim, bothe that they had ſo farre gone that it was nowe no ſuretie to retreate (as for that they thought it for the weale vnyuerſall to take that waye, although they had not yet begon it.) Wherfore if it woulde like his grace to take the croune vpon hym, they would humbly beſeche hym thervnto, and if he woulde geue theim a reſolute aunſwer to the contrarye (whiche they would bee lothe to here) then muſte they ſeke and ſhould not fayle to fynde ſome other noble man that would. Theſe woordes muche moued the protectoure, whiche as euery manne of ſmall intelligēce maye wyt would neuer haue enclyned thereto, but when he ſawe there was none other waye but that he muſte take it, or els he and his bothe to go from it, he ſayde to the lordes and commōs, ſith it is we perceaue well that all the realme is ſo ſet (whereof we be very ſory) that they wyll not ſuffre in any wyſe kyng Edwardes lyne to gouerne theim, whome no manne earthly can gouerne agaynſte their owne wylles: And we alſo perceaue that no manne is there, to whome the croune can by ſo iuſte tytle apperteyne

With this there was a greate crye and ſhowte, criyng kyng Richard, and ſo the lordes went vp to the kyng, and ſo he was after ye daye called. But the people departed talkyng dyuerſly of the matter, euery manne as his fantaſie gaue hym, but muche thei merueled of this maner of dealyng, that the matter was on bothe partes made ſo ſtraunge as thoughe neuer the one parte communed with the other parte therof before, whē they wyſt that there was no man ſo dul that heard theim, but he perceaued well ynoughe that all the matter was made betwene theim: Howbeit, ſome excuſed that agayne, ſaiyng: all thyng muſte bee done in good ordre, and men muſt ſometyme for ye maner ſake not be acknowē what thei knowe. For at the conſecracion of a byſhop, euery manne perceaueth by payment of his bulles that he entēdeth

to bee one, yet when he is twiſe aſked whyther he wilbe a byſhop, he muſt ſaye naye, and at the third tyme take it vpon hym as compelled therto by his owne wyll. And in a ſtage playe, the people knowe right well that he that playeth the ſowdane is per caſe a ſowter, yet yf one of acquayntaunce perchaunce of lytle nurture ſhould call hym by his name while he ſtandeth in his maieſtie, one of his tourmentours might fortune breake his hed for marryng ye playe.

                     ly tooke vpō hym to be kyng the .xix. daye of Iune, in the yere of our Lord, a thouſand foure hundreth and. lxxxiii, &amp; in the .xxv. yere of Lewes the xi. then beyng Frenche kyng, and with greate ſolempnitee rode to Weſtmynſter, and there ſate in the ſeate royall, and called before hym the iudges of the realme, ſtreyghtly commaundynge theim to execute the lawe without fauoure or delaye, with many good exhortacions (of the which he folowed not one) and then he departed towarde the abbaye and at the churche doore he was met with proceſſion, and by the abbot to hym was delyuered the ſceptre of ſaint Edward, &amp; ſo went &amp; offred to ſant Edwardes ſhryne, whyle ye monkes ſange Te deum with a faynt courage, and from the churche he retourned to the palayce, where he lodged tyll the coronacion. And to bee ſure of all enemyes (as he thought) he ſent for .v. thouſande menne of ye north againſt his coronacion, whiche came vp euell apparelled and worſſe harneyſſed, in ruſtie harneys, neyther defenſable nor ſcoured to the ſale, whiche muſtered in fyneſoury felde, to the great diſdayne of all the lokers on.
                  The fourth daye of Iuly he came to ye towre by

water with his wife, and the fyfte daye he created Thomas Lorde Haward, duke of Norffolke &amp; ſyr Thomas Haward his ſoonne he created Earle of Surrey, and Willyam lorde Barkeley was then created erle of Notyngham, and Fraunces lorde Louell was then made Vicount Louell and the kynges chaumberlayne, and the lorde Stanley was deliuered out of warde for feare of his ſonne the lorde Straunge, whiche was then in Lancaſſhyre gatheryng menne (as menne ſaied) and the ſaied lorde was made Stuard of the kynges hou ſholde, like wyſe the archbyſhoppe of Yorke was deliuered, but Morton biſhop of Ely was deliuered to the duke of Buckingham to kepe in warde whiche ſent hym to his manoure of Brecknoke in Wales, from whence he eſcaped to kyng Richardes confuſyon. The ſame nighte the kyng made .xvii. knightes of the bathe. The nexte day he rode throughe Londō with great pompe, &amp; in eſpeciall the duke of Buckinghā was richely appareled &amp; his horſe trapped in blewe veluet enbroudered wt ye naues of cartes burning of golde, whiche trapper was borne by footemē frō ye grounde, wt ſuche aſolēpne faſſyon yt all menne muche regarded it.
                  On ye morowe being the .vi. day of Iuly ye kyng came toward his coronaciō into Weſtminſter hal where his chapell &amp; all the prelates mytred receaued hym. And ſo they in ordre of proceſſyon paſſed forward. After ye proceſſion folowed therle of Nor thumberlād with a pointleſſe ſweard naked, &amp; the lorde Stanley bare the Mace of ye conſtableſhip, The erle of Kent bare the ſecond ſwerd on ye right hand of the kyng naked. The lord Louell bare an

other ſwerd on ye lefte hand. Then folowed ye duke of Suffolke with the Sceptre, and therle of Lincolne with ye balle and croſſe. After theim folowed the newe Erle of. Surrey with the ſwerd of eſtate in a riche ſkabard. On the ryght ſide of hym went the duke of Norffolke bearing ye croune, then folowed kyng Richard in a Circot and robe of purple veluet vnder a canable borne by the barones of yt fyue portes, going betwene ye biſhoppes of Bathe and Dureſme. The duke of Buckingham with ye rod of the high ſtuard of Englande bare the kynges traine. After hym folowed the erle of Hunting don, bearing the quenes ſceptre, and the Vicount Li
                        ••
                     e, bearing the rod with the doue. And the erle of Wilſhere bare the quenes croune. Then folowed quene Anne doughter to Richard erle of War wike in robes lyke to the kyng, betwene two byſſhoppes, and a canabie ouer her hed, borne by the Barones of the portes. On her hed a rich coronal ſet with ſtones and pearle. After her folowed the counteſſe of Richmond heire to ye duke of Somerſet, whiche bare vp ye quenes traine. After folowed the ducheſſe of Suffolke and Norffolke with coū
                     teſſes baroneſſes, ladies, &amp; many faire gentilwemē in this ordre they paſſed thorough the palaice &amp; entred ye abbay at the weſt end, &amp; ſo came to their ſeates of eſtate. And after diuerſe ſōges ſol
                        •
                     ply ſong they both diſcended to the high altare &amp; were ſhifted from their robes, &amp; had diuerſe places open frō the middle vpward, in whiche places they were anointed. Then both the kyng &amp; the quene chaunged theim into cloth of gold &amp; aſcended to their ſeates, where the cardinal of Cauntourburie &amp; other

byſhoppes theim crouned according to ye cuſtome of the realme, geuing hym ye ſcepter in the left hād and the balle wt the croſſe in the ryght hand, &amp; the quene had ye ſceptre in her right hand, &amp; the rod wt the doue in the left hand. On euery ſide of ye kyng ſtode a duke, &amp; before hym ſtode therle of Surrey with the ſwerd in his handes. And on euery ſide of the quene ſtāding a biſhop &amp; a ladie kneling. The Cardinal ſong maſſe, &amp; after paxe, the kyng &amp; the quene diſcended, &amp; before the high altare they wer bothe houſeled wt one hoſte, deuyded betwene thē After maſſe finiſhed, they bothe offred at ſaint Edwardes ſhrine, &amp; there the kyng lefte the croune of ſaint Edward, and put on his owne crowne. And ſo in ordre as they came, they departed to weſtminſter hal, &amp; ſo to their chambres for a ceaſō, duryng which time the duke of Norffolke came into ye hal his horſe traped to the ground in cloth of gold as high merſhall, and voided the hall.
                  About .iiii. of ye clocke the kyng &amp; quene entred the halle, and the kyng ſate in the middle, and the quene on the left hand of the table, &amp; on euery ſide of her ſtoode a counteſſe holding a clothe of pleaſaunce, when ſhe liſt to drinke. And on ye right hād of the kyng ſat the byſhop of Cauntourbury, the ladies ſat all on one ſide in the middle of the hall. And at the table againſte theim ſat the Chauncelloure and all the lordes. At the table next the cupborde ſate the Maire of London. And at the table behinde the lordes, ſate the Barones of the portes And at the other bordes ſate noble and worſhypfull perſonages. When all perſones wer ſette, the the duke of Norffolke, earle Merſhal, the earle of

Surrey conſtale for that daye, the lorde Stanley lorde Steward, Sir willyam Hopton treaſourer, and ſir Thomas Percie comptroller came in and ſerued the kyng ſolemplye with one diſhe of golde and another of ſyluer. And the quene all in gylte veſſell, and the biſhop all in ſiluer. At the ſeconde courſe came into yt hall, ſir Robert Democke the kynges champion, making a proclamacion, that whoſoeuer woulde ſaye that kyng Richarde was not lawfullye kyng, he woulde fight with hym at the vtteraunce, and threwe downe his gauntlet, &amp; thē all the hall cried kyng Richard. And ſo he did in thre partes of the halle, and then one broughte hym a cup of wyne couered, &amp; when he had dronke he caſte oute the drinke, &amp; departed with the cuppe After that the herauldes cryed alargeſſe thryſe in the halle, &amp; ſo went vp to their ſtaige. At the ende of diner, the Mayre of London ſerued the kyng &amp; quene with ſwete wyne, and had of eche of theim a cuppe of golde with a couer of gold. And by that tyme that all was done, it was darkenight. And ſo the kyng retourned to his chaumbre, and euery man to his lodging. When this feaſte was thus fyneſhed, the kyng ſente home all the lordes into their countrees that woulde departe, excepte the lorde Stanley, whome he reteyned tyll he hearde what his ſoonne the lorde ſtraunge wente aboute And to ſuche as wente home, he gaue ſtreyghte charge and cōmaundement to ſee their countryes well ordred, and yt no wronge nor extorcion ſhould bee done to his ſubiectes. And thus he taught other to execute iuſtice &amp; equite, the contrary wherof he daylye exercyſed, he alſo with greate rewardes

geuen to the Northrenmenne whyche he ſent for to hys coronation, ſente theim home to theyre country wyth greate thanckes. Whereof dyuerſe of theim, (as they all be of nature verye gredye of authoryte, and ſpecyally whē they thynke to haue any conforte or fauoure,) tooke on them ſo hyghly and wroughte ſuch maſtreis, that ye kyng was fayne to ryde thether in hys fyrſte yere, and to put ſome in execution, and ſtaye the countrye, or elles no ſmall myſchechefe had enſued.
                  Nowe after thys tryumphante coronation, there fell myſchiefes thycke &amp; thicke, as the thing euell gotten is neuer well kepte, ſo through al the tyme of hys vſurped reygne, neuer ceaſed theyre quel, murder, death &amp; ſlaughter tyll his owne deſtruccion ended it. But as he fyniſhed wt the beſt deathe and mooſte ryghtwyſe, that is to ſaye hys owne, ſo beganne he wyth the mooſt pyteous and wycked, I meane the lamentable murther of his innocente nephewes, the yonge kynge and hys tender brother, whoſe death and fortune hath neuertheleſſe ſo farre come in queſtyon that ſome remayned long in doubte whether they were in his dayes deſtroyed or not. For yt Parkin Warbek by many folkes malyce, &amp; mo folkes folye ſo long ſpace abuſynge the worlde, was aſwell wt prnceis as wt poore people reputed &amp; taken for the younger of theſe two. But for that alſo that all thynges were ſo couertly demeaned, one thynge pretē
                     ted and another mente, that there was nothynge ſo playne and openly proued, but that yet for the common cuſtome of cloſe and couert dealyng, mē
                     
had it euer inwardly ſuſpect, as many well countrefet iewelles make the true miſtruſted. Howbeit concernyng that opinion menne maye ſee the conueighaunce therof in the lyfe of the noble prynce kyng Henry the ſeuēth, in the proceſſe of Parkyn. But in the meane ceaſon, for this preſent matter I ſhall reherſe to you the dolorous ende of theſe two babes, not after euery way that I haue heard but after that waye that I haue ſo heard by ſuche menne and ſuche meanes as me thynketh it to be heard but it ſhould be true.
                  Kyng Rychard after his coranacion, takynge Howe and after what maner the two ſōnes of king Edward were deſtroyed. his waye to Glouceſtre, to viſyte in his newe honoure the toune, of whiche he bare the name of olde, deuyſed as he roade to fulfyll that thynge which he before had intended. And foraſmuche as his mynde gaue hym that his nephewes lyuyng, men woulde not recon that he coulde haue right to the realme, he thought therfore without delaye to ryd theim, as though the kyllyng of his kynſmen might ende his cauſe, and make hym kyndely kyng. Wherupon he ſent Iohn Grene, whome he ſpecially truſted, to ſyr Roberte Brakenburye conſtable of the towre, with a lettre and credence alſo, that the ſame Syr Robert in any wiſe ſhould put the two chyldren to death. This Iohn Grene dyd his errand to Syr Robert Brakenbury knelyng before our ladye in the towre, who playnelye aūſwered that he would neuer put theim to death to dye therfore. With the whiche aunſwer Grene returned, recountyng the ſame to kynge Rycharde at Warwike yet on his iourneye, wherewith he toke ſuche diſpleaſure &amp; thought, yt the ſame night

he ſayed to a ſecrete page of his. Ah, whome ſhall a manne truſte? they that I haue broughte vp my ſelfe, they that I went would haue moſte ſurely ſerued me, euen thoſe fayle me, and at my cōmaundement wyll doo nothing for me. Syr ꝙ the page, there lyeth one in ye palet chaumbre without, that I dare well ſaye, to dooe youre grace pleaſure, the thing were ryght heard that he would refuſe, meaning this by Iames Tirell, whiche was a manne of goodly perſonage, and for the gyftes of nature worthie to haue ſerued a muche better prince, if he had well ſerued God, and by grace obteyned to haue aſmuche treweth and good wyll, as he had ſtrengthe and wyll.
                  The manne had an hyghe hearte and ſore longed vpwarde, not riſyng yet ſo faſte as he had hoped, beynge hyndred and kepte vnder by ſyr Rycharde Ratcliffe and ſir willyam Cateſbye, which longing for nō more parteners of the Princes fauoure, namely not for him, whoſe pride they knew woulde beare no pere, kept hym by ſecrete driftes oute of all ſecrete truſt, which thing this page had well marked and knowen, wherfore, this occaſion offred, of verye ſpeciall frendſhippe ſe his tyme to ſet hym forwarde, and by ſuche wyſe to dooe hym good, that all the enemies that he had (excepte the deuell) coulde neuer haue dooen hym ſo muche hurte and ſhame, for vpon the pages woordes kynge Rycharde arooſe, for this communicacyon had he ſytting on a drafte, a conuenyente carpet for ſuche a counſaile, and came oute into the palette chaumbre, where he dyd fynde in bedde

the ſayd Iames Tyrell and ſyr Thomas Tyrell of perſone like and brethren of blood, but nothyng of kynne in condicions. Then ſayde ye kyng merely to theim, what ſyrs, be you in bed ſo ſone? &amp; called vp Iames Tyrrell, and brake to hym ſecretely his mynde in this myſcheuous matter, in ye which he foūde hym nothyng ſtraunge. Wherfore on the morowe he ſent hym to Brakenburye with a lettre by the whiche he was commaunded to delyuer to the ſayde Iames all the keyes of the towre for a night, to thende that he might there accomplyſhe the kynges pleaſure in ſuche thynges as he there had geuen hym in commaundement. After which lettre delyuered and the keyes receaued, Iames appoynted the nexte nyght enſuynge to deſtroye theim, deuyſyng before &amp; preparyng the meanes.
                  The prince aſſone as the protectoure tooke vpō hym to bee kyng, and left the name of protectoure, was therof aduertiſed and ſhewed, that he ſhould not reygne but his vncle ſhould haue the croune At whiche woorde the prynce ſore abaſhed beganne to ſighe and ſayed: Alas I woulde myne vncle woulde lette my haue me lyfe althoughe I leſe my kyngdome. Then he that tolde hym the tale vſed hym with good woordes and put hym in the beſt conforte that he coulde, but foorthwith he and his brother were both ſhut vp, and all other remoued from theim, one called blacke Wyll, and wyllyam ſlaughter only excepte, whiche were ſette to ſerue theim, and .iiii. other to ſee theim ſure. After whiche tyme, the prince neuer tyed his poyntes nor any thyng rought of hym ſelfe, but with that young babe his brother lyngered in thought and

heueuyſſe, till theſe trayterous death deliuered theim of that wretchedneſſe.
                  For Iames Tirrell deuiſed that thei ſhould be murthered in their beddes, and no bloode ſhed, to thexecuciō wherof he apoincted Myles Foreſt one of the foure that before kepte theim, a feloe fleſhe bred in murther before tyme: and to him he ioyned one Ihon Dighton his awne horſkeper, a bygge broade ſquare &amp; ſtrong knaue. Then all the other beyng remoued from theim, this Myles Foreſt &amp; Ihon Dighton aboute mydnight the children beyng in their beddes, came into the chaumbre and The murtherynge of kynge Edward his chyldren. ſodenly lapped theim vp emongeſt the clothes &amp; ſo bewrapped theim and entangled theim, kepyng downe by force the fetherbed and pyllowes heard vnto their mouthes, yt within awhile thei ſmored and ſtyfled theim, and their brethes faylyng thei gaue vp to God their innocent ſoules into ye ioyes of heauen, leauyng to the tourmētoures their bodyes dedde in the bed, whiche after ye wretches perceaued, firſt by yt ſtrugglyng, with ye panges of dea the, &amp; after long liyng ſtill to be throughly dedde, thei laied the bodyes out vpon ye bed, and fetched Iames Tirrell to ſe theim, whiche when he ſawe theim perfightly ded, he cauſed the murtherers to burie theim at the ſtayre foote metely depe in the grounde vnder a greate heape of ſtones.
                  Thē rode Iames Tirrell in great haſt to kyng Rychard and ſhewed hym all the maner of ye murther, who gaue hym greate thankes, and as mēne ſaye, there made hym knight, but he alowed not their buriall in ſo vyle a corner, ſaiyng yt he would haue theim buryed in a better place, becauſe thei

were a kynges ſoonnes. Lo the honourable courage of a kyng, for he would recompence a deteſtable murther with a ſolempne obſequy. Wherupō a preeſt of ſir Robert Brakenburyes tooke theim vp and buried theim in ſuche a place ſecretly as by the occaſion of his death (whiche was verie ſhortlye after) whiche onely knewe it, the very truthe could neuer yet bee very well &amp; perfighly knowen For ſome ſaie that kyng Rychard cauſed yt preeſt to take theim vp &amp; cloſe theim in lead &amp; put theim in a coffine full of holes hoked at ye endes with .ii. hokes of yron, &amp; ſo to caſte them into a place called ye Blacke depes at ye thamis mouth, ſo yt thei ſhuld neuer riſe vp nor bee ſeen again. This was ye very truth vnknowē by reaſon that ye ſaid preſte dyed ſo ſhortly &amp; diſcloſed it neuer to any perſone ye would vtter it. And for a truthe, when ſir Iames Tirrell was in the towre for treaſon committed to kyng Hēry the ſeuenth: bothe he and Dighton were examined together of this poynte, &amp; bothe thei confeſſed the murther to bee dooen in theſame maner as you haue hearde, whether ye bodies were remoued thei bothe affirmed thei neuer knewe. And thus as I haue learned of theim yt muche knewe and litle cauſe had to lye, wer theſe .ii. noble princes, theſe innocēt tēdre childrē, borne of ye moſte royall blood &amp; brought vp ī great welth, likely lōge to liue, to reigne &amp; rule in yt realme, by treyterous tirāny taken &amp; depriued of their eſtate, ſhortly ſhut vp in priſon &amp; priuely ſlain &amp; murderd by ye cruell ambicion of their vnnaturall vncle &amp; diſpiteous tourmētours whiche thynges on euery part well pōdered, God gaue this worlde neuer a more notable exſample,

either ī what vnſurety ſtādeth this worldes weale or what miſchief worketh ye proud entrepriſe of an high hearte, or finally what wretched ende enſueth ſuche diſpiteous crueltie? For firſt to begynne wt ye miniſtres, Miles Foreſt, at ſ. Martines le graūd by peace meale miſerablye rotted awaye, Ihon Dightō liued at Caleys long after, no leſſe diſdeined &amp; hated then poynted at, &amp; there dyed in great miſery. But ſir Iames Tirrell was behedded at the towre hill for treaſon. And kyng Richard hymſelf was ſlain in ye feelde hacked and hewed of his enemies handes, haried on a horſbacke naked beyng ded, his heare in diſpite torne &amp; tugged like a curre dogge. And the miſcheif yt he toke wt in leſſe then thre yeres, of the miſchief yt he did in thre monethes be not comperable, &amp; yet all ye meane tyme ſpēt in much trouble &amp; pein outward, &amp; much feare dread &amp; anguiſh wt in. For I haue heard by credible perſons of ſuche as were ſecret wt his chaūberers yt after this abhominable dede dooē he neuer was quiet in his minde, he neuer thought hymſelf ſure where he wēt abrode, his bodie preuely feinted, his eyen wherled about, his hand euer on his dagger his countenaunce &amp; maner like alwayes to ſtryke again, he toke eiuill reſt on nightes, laye long wakyng &amp; muſyng, forweried with care &amp; watche, rather ſlōbred thē ſlept, troubled wt fearfull dreames ſodeinly ſome tyme ſtert vp, leapt out of his bed &amp; and looked aboute the chambres, ſo was his reſtleſſe hearte contynually toſſed and tou
                        〈…〉
                     bled with the tedious inpreſſion &amp; ſtormy remēbraūce of his abhomynable murther and exreable tirannie.
                  And ſhortely after he was vnquieted by a conſpiracie,

or rather a confederacie betwene the duke of Buckynghm̄ &amp; many other gentlemen againſt hym, as ye ſhall here the next yere. But the occaſiō why the duke and the kyng fell oute, is of dyuerſe folke dyuerſe wyſe pretended. This duke as you haue hearde before, aſſone as the duke of Glouceſter after the death of kyng Edward was come to Yorke, &amp; there had ſolempne funerall ſeruice dooen for kyng Edward, ſent to hym a ſecrete ſeruaunt of his called Perſall, with ſuche meſſages as you haue hearde before. And after ye duke of Buckyngham came with thre hundred horſſe to Northampton and ſtill continued with hym, as partener and chief organe of all his deuices till after his coronacion, thei departed to all ſemyng verye frendes at Glouceſtre. From whence aſſone as the duke came home, he ſo highly turned from hym and ſo highly conſpired againſt hym, that a māne would meruell wherof ye chaūge grewe in ſo ſhorte ſpace. Some ſaie this occaſyon was, yt a litle before yt coronacion, ye duke required the kyng emōgeſt other thrnges to bee reſtored to the Erle of Herffordes lāoes. And foraſmuche as the title whiche he claymed by inherytaunce, was ſomewhat interlaced with the title of Lancaſter, whiche houſe made a title to the croune, and enioyed theſame three dyſcentes, as all menne knewe, till the houſe of Yorke depryued the third kyng, whiche was Henry the ſixte. Kyng Rychard ſomewhat miſtruſted &amp; conceaued ſuche an indignacion that he reiected the dukes requeſt, with many ſpitefull and minotary woordes, whiche ſo wounded the dukes hearte wt hatred and miſtruſt, that he could neuer after endure

to looke ryght on kyng Rychard, but euer feared his owne lyfe, ſo farrefoorth that when the protectoure ſhould ryde to his coronacion, feigned hymſelfe ſycke, becauſe he would dooe hym no honoure. And the other takyng it in euell parte ſente hym woorde to ryſe and ryde or he would make hym to be caryed. Wherupō gorgeouſly apparelled and ſumpteouſly trapped with burnyng carte naues of golde embrodered, he roade before the kyng through London with an euell wyll and woorſſe heart. And yt notwithſtandyng, he roaſe ye daye of the coronacion from the feaſte, feignyng hym ſelfe ſycke, whiche kyng Richarde ſayde was dooē in hate and ſpight of hym. And therfore men ſayd that eche of theim euer after lyued cōtynually in ſuche hatred and dyſtruſt of other, that the duke looked verelye to haue bene murthered at Glouceſtre, frō whiche he in fayre maner departed but ſurely ſuche as were right ſecrete with bothe, affyrme all this to be vntrue, and other wyſe mēne thynke it vnlykely, the depe dyſſymulyng nature of bothe theſe menne well conſydered. And what nede in that grene world the protectoure hadde of the duke, and in what perell the duke ſtoode yf he fell once in ſuſpycion of that tyraunte, that other ye protectoure would geue the duke occaſyon of dyſpleaſure, or the duke the protectoure occaſyon of myſtruſt. And ſurely menne thynke, that if kyng Rychard hadde any ſuche opynyon conceaued in hym, he would neuer haue ſuffred hym to aduoyd his handes or eſcape his power, but verye true it is, that the duke of Buckyngham was an high mynded man, &amp; euell could beare the glorye of another,

ſo that I haue hearde of ſome that ſawe it yt he at ſuche tyme that the croune was ſet vpon the protectoures hedde, his yie could neuer abyde the ſight therof, but wryed his hed another waye, but men ſayde he was not well at eaſe, and that was both to kyng Richard well knowen and well takē nor any demaunde of the dukes requeſt vncurteouſly reiected, but gentelye deferred, but bothe he with greate giftes and high beheſtes in moſte louyng and truſtie maner departed from the kyng to Glouceſter. But ſone after his commyng home to Brecknocke, hauyng there by kyng Richardes commaundemēt doctour Moorton byſhop of Ely who before as you haue hearde was taken at the councell at the towre, waxed with hym very famylyer, whoſe onlye wyſedome abuſed his pryde to his owne delyueraunce &amp; the dukes dyſtruccion. The byſhop was a man of great natural wyt, verye well learned and of honourable behaueoure, lackyng no wyſe wayes to wynne fauour. He was fyrſt vpon the parte of kyng Henry, whyle yt parte was in wealth, and neyther left it nor forſoke it in no woo, but fled the realme with the quene and the prince. And while kyng Edward had kyng Henry in pryſon, he neuer retourned but to the felde at Barner. After whiche felde loſte &amp; vtterly ſubdued &amp; al parte takynges extynguiſhed, kyng Edward for his faſt faythe and wyſedome, was not onelye cōtent to receaue hym but alſo wooed hym to come and had hym frō thenſforth both in ſecrete truſt &amp; ſpecyall fauoure, whom he nothyng deceaued. For he beyng after kyng Edwardes death fyrſt taken by the tyraunt for his truthe to the kynge, founde

meane to ſette the duke in his toppe, and ioyned gentlemen together in ayde of the erle of Richemounde, whiche after was named kyng Henrye the ſeuenth. Fyrſt deuyſyng the maryage betwene the ladye Elizabeth daughter to kynge Edwarde the fourthe, by the whiche, his faythfull &amp; true ſeruyce declared to both his maſters at once, was, wt infinite benefite to ye realme, by the coniunccion of the bloddes of Lancaſtre and Yorke, whoſe funerall tytles had longe inquyeted the realme. This manne afterwarde eſcaped from the duke and 
                        〈…〉
                     d the realme, and went to Rome, neuer myndyng to medle with the worlde, tyl kyng henry the ſeuenth ſent for hym, and after made hym archebyſhop of Cauntorbury and chauncelour of Englande and after was made cardinall, and lyued well to all mennes iudgementes and dyed well. But to retourne to ye former purpoſe, he by the long &amp; often alternate proffe, aſwel of proſperytee as aduerſe of fortune, had gotten by great experience the verey mother &amp; maſtreſſe of wyſedome, a depe inſight in pollytike worldlye driftes, whereby perceauynge nowe ye duke to cōmen with hym, fed hym wt fayre woordes and many pleaſaunt prayſes, and perceauyng by the grefe of their communicacions the dukes pryde nowe and then to balke oute a lytle brayde of enuye towarde the glorye of the kynge, and thereby feelynge hym eaſye to fall oute yf the matter were well handled, he craftely ſoughte the wayes to prycke hym forwarde, takynge alwayes the occaſyon of hys commynge, and alſo keepynge hymſelfe clooſe wythin hys bandes, that he rather ſemed to folowe hym then to

leade hym. For when the duke beganne fyrſte to prayſe and boaſte the kyng and ſhewe how muche profite the realme ſhould take by his reigne. Byſhoppe Morton aunſwered, ſurely my lorde, folye it were for me to lye, for I am ſure yf I woulde ſwere the contrarye ye would not once beleue me, but yf the worlde would haue begone as I would haue wyſhed, that kyng Henryes ſoonne had had the croune and not kynge Edwarde, then woulde I haue bene his true and faythfull ſubiecte, but after that God had ordeyned hym to loſe it, and kyng Edwarde to reigne, I was neuer ſo madde with a dead manne to ſtryue agaynſt the quycke, ſo was I euer to kynge Edwarde a faythfull and true chapeleyn, and gladde would haue bene that his chyldren ſhoulde haue ſucceded hym, howbeit yf the ſecrete iudgemente of God haue otherwyſe prouyded, I purpoſe not to ſpurne agaynſte the prycke, nor laboure to ſet vp that God pulleth downe. And as for the late protectoure and nowe kyng, and with that woorde he left, ſauynge that he ſaide that he hadde alreadye medled to muche with the worlde, and would from that daye medle with his booke and bedes, and no ferther. Then longed the duke ſore to heare what he woulde haue ſayde, becauſe he ended with the kynge, and there ſo ſodeynlye ſtopped, and exhorted hym famylyerly, betwene theim bothe to bee bolde and to ſaye whatſoeuer he thought, whereof he faythfullye promyſed there ſhoulde neuer come hurte, and paraduenture more good then he woulde were. And that he hym ſelfe entended to vſe hys faythfull ſecrete aduyce and counſayle, which

he ſayed was the onlye cauſe for the whyche he procured of the kynge to haue hym in hys cuſtodye, where he myghte recon hym ſelfe at home, or elles he hadde bene putte in the handes of theim wyth whome he ſhoulde not haue founde lyke fauoure. The biſhoppe right humblye thanked hym and ſayed, in good faythe my lorde, I loue not muche to talke of prynces as of a thynge not all oute of perell, althoughe the woorde bee without faute, but as it pleaſeth the prince to conſtrue it. And euer I thynke on Iſopes tale, that when the Lyon had proclaymed that on payne of deathe there ſhoulde no horned beaſtes come into the wood, one beaſte that had a bonche of fleſhe growing oute of his hedde, fledde a greate pace: ye Foxe that ſawe hym flye with all the haſte, aſked hym whether he fledde? In fayth ꝙ he, I neither wote ne recke ſo I were once hence, becauſe of the proclamacyon made agaynſte horned beaſtes.
                  What foole ꝙ the foxe, the Lyon neuer ment it by the, for that whiche thou haſte is no horne in thy hedde. No mary ꝙ he, I wote that well ynoughe, but yf he ſaye it is a horne, where am I then? The duke laughed merely at the tale &amp; ſaied, my lorde I warraunte you, neither the Lyon nor the bore ſhall pycke any matter at any thyng here ſpoken, for it ſhall neuer come nere their cares. In good faythe ſyr ſaied the Byſhoppe, yf it dyd, the thyng that I was aboute to ſaye taken aſwell as before God I mente, it coulde deſerue but thanke, and yet taken as I wene it would, myghte happen to turne me to lytle good and you to leſſe.
                  Then longed the duke muche more to were what

it was, wherupon the byſhop ſaied. In good faith my lord, as for the late protectoure, 
                        •
                     ith he is now kyng in poſſeſſyon I purpoſe not to diſpute his title, but for the welthe of this realme, whereof his grace hathe nowe the gouernaunce, and wherof I my ſelfe am a poore membre, I was aboute to wyſh that to thoſe good habilitees wherof he hath already righte many, litle nedyng my prayſe, yet mighte it haue pleaſed God for the better ſtore to haue geuen hym ſome of ſuche other excellent vertues mete for the rule of the realme, as oure Lord hath planted in the perſone of your grace, &amp; there lefte of againe. Of whiche woordes the duke perceauyng that the byſhop bare vnto hym his good hearte and fauoure, myſtruſted not to entre more plaine cōmunicacion with hym, ſo farre, that at ye laſte the byſhoppe declared hym ſelfe to bee one of theim that would gladly helpe that Richard who then vſurped the croune mighte bee depoſed, if he had knowen howe it myghte conuenientely bee broughte to paſſe ye ſuche a perſone as had true title of inheritaunce vnto the ſame, might bee reſtored therunto. Vpon this the ſaied duke, knowing the biſhoppe to bee a manne of prudence and fidelitee opened to hym all his whole hart and entent ſaying, my lorde I haue deuiſed ye waye howe the bloodde both of kyng Edward and of kyng Henry the ſyxte, that is lefte, beyng coupled by maryage and affinitee maye bee reſtored vnto ye croune being by iuſte and true title due vnto theim both, (for kyng Richard he called not ye brother of kyng Edwarde the fourth, but his enemye and mortall fooe). The waye that the Duke had deuyſed was

this, that they ſhoulde with all ſpede and celerytee fynde meanes to ſende for Henry earle of Rich mounte (whome the rumoure wente immediatlye vpon knowledge of kynge Edwardes deathe to haue bene deliuered oute of pryſone with Fraunces Duke of Brytaine) &amp; the ſame Henry to helpe with all their power and ſtrength, ſo that the ſaied Henry woulde fyrſte by his feithfull othe, promiſe that ymmediatly vpon obteigning the croune, he woulde mary and take to wyfe Elyzabeth the elder doughter of Edward the fourth. The byſhop of Ely ryghte well alowed bothe the deuyce and purpoſe of the duke, and alſo the maner and waye howe the matter ſhoulde bee broughte to effecte, and founde meanes that Reynold Breye ſeruaūr with Margarete mother of the ſaied Henry, then maried to Thomas Stanley, came to the duke in to Wales, and the dukes mynde throughlye perceaued and knowen, with greate ſpede retourned to the ſaied Margarete, aduertiſyng the ſame of all thinges which betwene the duke and hym concerning aſwell the cōmon weale of the realme, as alſo the aduauncemente of her and her bloodde had been debated.
                  Nowe it came ſo to paſſe that the duke of Buckyngham and the ladye Margaret mother to the ſaied Henrye, had bene in communicacyon of the ſame matter before, and that the ſaied lady Margarete had deuiſed the ſame meane and waye for the depoſycion of kynge Rycharde and bringyng in of Henry her ſonne, the whiche the Duke nowe brake vnto the byſhop of Ely, wherupon the
                        •
                     e reſted no more, foraſmuche as ſhe perceaued ye duke

nowe willyng to proſecute and further the ſayed deuice, but that ſhe ſhould fynde the meanes that this matter myghte bee broken vnto Quene Elizabeth the wyfe of kyng Edwade the fourthe then beynge in the Sanctuarye. And hereupon ſhe cauſed one Lewes that was her phyſicyan in his owne name, and as thoughe it came of hym ſelfe to breake this matter vnto the quene, ſaying, that yf ſhe would conſent and agree therunto, a meane might bee founde howe to reſtore agayne ye blood of kyng Edwarde and kyng Henrye the ſyxte vnto the croune, and to bee aduenged of kynge Rycharde for the murther of kyng Edwardes chyldren, and then declared that there was beyonde yt ſee Henry Earle of Richemounte, whiche was of the blood of Henry the ſixte, whome yf ſhe woulde be content yt he marye Elizabeth her eldeſt doughter, there ſhoulde of his ſyde bee made righte many frendes, and ſhe for her parte myghte helpe in lyke maner, wherby no doubte it ſhoulde come to paſſe that he ſhoulde poſſeſſe the croune by mooſt rightfull inheritaunce. Whiche matter when ſhe heard it, it liked her excedingly well, in ſo much as ſhe counceled the ſaied phiſicyan to breake ye ſame vnto his maiſtreſſe the ladye Margaret &amp; knowe her mynde therein, promiſyng vpon her woorde that ſhe would make all the frendes of kyng Edwarde to take parte with the ſayed Henrye yf he woulde be ſworne that when he came to the poſſeſſyon of the croune, he woulde immediately take in maryage Elyzabeth her eldeſt doughter, or elles yf ſhe lyued not that tyme, that then he would take Cicile her yongeſt doughter
                  
                     
Whereupon the ſayde Lewes retourned vnto the ladye Margarete hys mayſtreſſe declarynge vnto her the whole mynd and entent of the quene So that thē it was ſhortly agreed betwene theſe two wemen, that wyth al ſpede thys matter ſhold be ſet forwarde, in ſo much that the lady Margarete brake thys matter vnto Reynolde Bray wyllynge hym to moue and ſet forwarde the ſame wt all ſuche as he ſhoulde perceaue eyther hable to doo good or wyllynge thereunto. Then had the quene deuyſed, that one Chryſtopher (whome the foreſayde Lewes the Phyſicyan had promoted into her ſeruyce) ſhoulde bee ſente into Brytayne to Henrye to geue hym knowledge of theyr myndes here, and that he ſhoulde prepare and apoynt hym ſelfe redye and to come into Wales, where he ſhoulde fynde ayde and helpe ynonghe readye to receaue hym.
                  But then ſhortly after yt came vnto her knowledge that the Duke of Buckingham had of himſelfe afore entended the ſame matter, whereupon ſhe thoughte yt ſhould be mete to ſende ſome meſſenger of more reputacyon and credyte then was thys Chryſtopher, and ſo kepte hym at home, and then ſente Hughe Conewaye wyth a greate ſome of monye, wyllynge hym to declare vnto Henrye all thynges, and that he ſhould haſt hym to come and to lande in Wales as is aforeſayde. And after hym one Rycharde Guilforde oute of Kente ſente one Thomas Ramey wyth the ſame meſſage, the whyche two meſſengers came in maner bothe at one tyme into Brytayn to the Earle Henrye, and declared vnto hym all theyr commyſſiōs

The whiche meſſage when Henry had perceaued and throughly heard, it reioyſed his harte, and he gaue thankes vnto God fully purpoſyng with al conuenyente ſpede to take his iourney towardes England, deſiryng the aide and helpe of the duke of Brytayne, with promiſe of thanckfull recompence when God ſhould ſende hym to come to his ryghte. The duke of Britayne notwithſtanding that he had not longe after been required by Thomas Hutton purpoſely ſent to hym from kyng Richard in meſſage with monye efte ſones to impriſone the ſaied Henry erle of Richemoūt, and there continually to kepe and holde the ſame frome cō
                     minge into Englande, yet with all gladneſſe and fauoure inclined to the deſyre of Henry and aided hym as he might with menne, monye, ſhypes and other neceſſaryes. But Henry whyle he might accordynglye appoynte and furnyſhe hym ſelfe, remayned in Brytayne ſendyng afore the foreſayde Hughe Coneway and Thomas Ramney, whiche two were to hym very trewe and faithful to beare tidynges into Englande vnto his frendes of his commynge, to the ende that they myghte prouydentlye ordre all thynges aſwell for the commodyous receauynge of hym at his comminge, as alſo foreſeynge ſuche daungers as myghte befalle, and aduoydinge ſuche trappes and ſnares as by Rycharde the thyrde and hys complyces myght bee ſette for hym and for all his other company that he ſhould bryng with hym.
                  In the meane tyme, the frendes of Henrye with all care, ſtudye, and dilygence wroughte all thynges vnto their purpoſe belongynge.

And thoughe all this were as ſecretlye wrought and conueyed as emonge ſo greate a nombre was poſſible to be, yet pryuye knowledge therof came to the eares of kyng Rychard, who althoughe he were at the firſte hearynge muche abaſſhed, yet thought beſt to dyſſemble the matter as thoughe he had no knowledge therof, whyle he myghte ſecretly gather vnto hym power and ſtrengthe, and by ſecrete ſpyall emonge the people get more perfyght knowledge of the whole matters and chiefe autoures &amp; contryuers of the ſame. And becauſe he knewe be chiefe &amp; princypal of theim, as vnto whō his owne conſcience knewe that he hadde geuen moſte iuſt cauſes of enemytee, he thought it neceſſary firſt of all to dyſpatche the ſame duke oute of the waye. Wherfore, vnto the duke he addreſſed letters enfarced and replenyſhed with all humanytee, frendſhippe, famylyaritee and ſweteneſſe of woordes, wyllyng and deſyryng the ſame to come vnto hym with all conuenyent ſpede. And ferther gaue in commaundemente to the meſſenger that caryed the letters that he ſhoulde in his behalfe make many high and gaye promyſes vnto ye duke &amp; by all gentle meanes perſuade the ſame to come vnto hym. But ye duke myſtruſtyng ye fayre woordes &amp; promyſes ſo ſodenly offred of hym, of whoſe wylye craftes and meanes he knewe ſondrye exſamples afore practiſed, deſyred ye kynges perdon, excuſyng him ſelf that he was deſeaſed &amp; ſicke, and that he might be aſſerteined ye if it poſſyble wer for hym to come, he would not abſent hym ſelf frō his grace. Thys excuſe the kyng would not admitte, but eftſones directed vnto ye duke other letters of

a more roughe ſorte, not wythoute manacynge and threatenynge onleſſe he woulde accordynge to hys dutye repayer vnto hym at hys callynge whereunto the duke plainely made aunſwer that he woulde not come vnto him whom he knewe to be hys enemye. And immedyatelye the duke prepared hym ſelfe to make warre agaynſt hym, and perſwaded all hys complyces and partakers of hys intente wyth all poſſyble expedycion ſome in one place and ſome in another to ſturre agaynſte kynge Rycharde. And by thys meanes in maner at one tyme and houre, Thomas Marques of Dorceſter reyſed an armye wythin the country of Yorke, beyng hym ſelfe late come forthe of ſāctuarye and by the meanes and helpe of Thomas Rowell preſerued and ſaued frome perel of death Alſo in Deuonſhyre, Edwarde Courtenay wyth hys brother Peter byſhoppe of Excetter reyſed in lyke maner an armye, and in Kent Rychard Guyl ford accompanied wyth certayn other gentylmen cayſed vp the people as is a foreſayde, &amp; all thys was done in maner in one moment. But the king who had in ye meane tyme gathered together gret power &amp; ſtrēgth thynkyng yt not to be beſt by purſuyng euery one of hys enemyes to dyſparkle hys cōpaygnie in ſmal flokes, determyned to let paſſe all the others, &amp; withal his whole puiſaunce to ſet vpon the chiefe heade, that is to ſaye the Duke of Buckynghm̄, ſo takyng his iourneye from Londō he went towardes Saliſbury to thentent that he might ſette vpon ye ſaid duke in caſe he might haue perfight knowledge that ye ſame laye in any felde embatailed. And nowe was the kyng within twoo

dayes iourney of Saliſbury when ye duke attempted to mete hym, beyng accompaignied with great ſtrength of Welſhmen, whom he had therunto en forced &amp; coherted, more by lordly commaundement then by lyberall wages and hyre, whiche thyng in deede was ye cauſe that thei fell from hym and forſooke hym. Wherfore beyng ſodenly forſaken of his menne, he was of neceſſite conſtrained to flee in whiche dooyng, as a manne caſt in ſodeine, and therfore greate feare, of this the ſodeine chaunge of fortune, &amp; by reaſon of theſame feare, not knowyng where to become, nor where to hyde his hed nor what in ſuche caſe beſt to dooe, he ſecretly conueighed hym ſelf into the hous of Homffraye Banaſtar, in whom he had conceaued a ſure hope and confidence to finde faithfull and truſtie vnto hym becauſe theſame had been &amp; thē was his ſeruaunt, entendyng there to remayne in ſecrete, vntill he might either reiſe a newe armie or els by ſome meanes cōueigh hym ſelf into Brytein to Henry erle of Rychemount. But aſſone as theothers whiche had attempted theſame entrepryſe againſt ye kyng had knowledge that the duke was forſaken of his compaignie and fled and could not bee foūde, thei beyng ſtryken with ſodein feare, made euery māne for hym ſelf ſuche ſhift as he might, and beyng in vtter deſpayre of their health and life, either gotte theim to ſāctuaryes or deſerte places or els aſſaied to eſcape ouer ſea, &amp; many of theim in deede arryued ſauely in Britain, emong whom were theſe whoſe names enſue. Peter Curteney biſhop of Exceter with his brother Edward erle of Deuonſhire, Thomas marques of Dorceſtre with his

ſoonne Thomas beyng a verye yoūg chylde, Ihō Bourſhere, Ihon Welſhe, Edward Wooduyle a ſtoute manne of armes and brother to Elizabeth the quene, Robert Willoughby, Gyles Dawbeneye, Thomas Harondell, Ihon Cheiny with his twoo brethren, Wyllyam Berkeley, Wyllyam Brandō with Thomas his brother, Rychard Edgecome, and all theſe for the moſte parte knightes Alſo Ihon Halwell, Edwarde Poyntz an excellēt good capitain &amp; Chriſtopher Vrſwicke, but Ihon Moorton biſhop of Ely at theſelf ſame tyme together with ſondrye of the nobles and gentlemen ſailed into Flaundres.
                  But Richard the kyng, who was nowe come to Saliſbury and had gotten perfight knowledge that all theſe parties ſought to ſlie the realme, with all dyligence and haſt that might bee, ſent to all ye porte tounes theraboute to make ſure ſteye that none of theim might paſſe vntaken, and made proclamacion yt whoſoeuer would bryng hym knowledge where the duke of Buckynghm were to bee had, ſhould haue for his rewarde, if he were a bō
                     deman, his frebome, and if he were fre, his pardon and beſydes that, a thouſand pounde of moneye.
                  Furthermore becauſe he vnderſtode by Thomas Hutton newely retourned oute of Britein, of whom afore is mencioned, that Fraunces duke of Brytain, would not onelye holde Henry Erle of Rychmount in priſone for his ſake, but alſo was readie to helpe theſame Henry with menne, money and ſhippes in all that he might againſt hym, he ſette dyuerſe and ſondry ſhippes in places conuenyent by all the ſeacoſtes to Brytain ward, that if

Henry ſhould come that waye, he might either bee taken before his arriuall or els might bee kept frō landyng in any coaſte of England. And furthermore in euerie coaſte and corner of ye realme, laied wondrefull wayte and watche to take partely any other of his enemies, and ſpecially theſaid duke of Buckynghm̄. Wherupon theſaid Homffrey Banaſter (were it for mede or for loſyng his life and goodes,) diſcloſed. hym vnto the kynges inquyſy
                     
                        •
                     ours, who ymediatly tooke hym and foorthwith all, brought hym to Saliſbury where kyng Rychard was. The duke beyng dylygently examined vttred without any maner refuſall or ſtyckyng all ſuche thynges as he knewe, truſtyng that for his plain confeſſion he ſhould haue lybertee to ſpeake with the kyng, whiche he made moſte inſtaūt and humble peticion that he might dooe. But aſſone as he had cōfeſſed his offence towardes kyng Rychard, he was oute of hande behedded. And this death ye duke receaued at the handes of kyng Rychard whom he had before holpen in his affayrs and purpoſes beyonde all Gods forbode.
                  Whyle theſe thynges wer in hand in England Henry Erle of Richmount made readye his hoſte and ſtrength to the nombre of fiue thouſand Brytones and fiftene ſhippes, ye daye apoynted of his departure beyng nowe come, whiche was ye twelfe daye of the moneth of Octobre in the yere of our lorde God a thouſand foure hundred .lxxxiiii. and the ſeconde yere of ye reigne of kyng Richard and hauyng a fayre wynde, hoyſed vp the ſayles &amp; ſetforwarde, but towarde the night came ſuche a tempeſt that thei were diſperſed one from another

ſome into Britain and ſome into Normandy. But the ſhip in whiche Henry was with one other ſhip; toſſed all the night with the waues of the ſea and tempeſt, when the mornyng came, it waxed ſomewhat calme and faire weder, and thei were come toward the South parte of England by a hauen or porte called Poole, where theſaid Henry ſawe all the ſhores or bankes ſette full of harneſſedmen whiche were ſouldyours apoynted there to wayte, by kyng Rychard as we haue ſaied before, for the comyng &amp; landyng of the erle. While Henry there abode he gaue commaundement, that no manne ſhould land before yt comyng of the other ſhippes. And in the meane tyme that he wayted for theim, he ſent a litle bote with a fewe in it a lād to knowe what thei were that ſtoode on the ſhore, his frēdes or enemies. To whom thoſe ſouldyours beeyng before taught what thei ſhould ſaie, aunſwered that thei were the frendes of Henry and were appoynted by ye duke of Buckynghm̄ there to abide his commyng and to conducte hym to thoſe caſtelles and holdes where his tentes, pauylyons and ar

                      for feare and cleane without prouiſion, and therfore beſought hym to come alande.
                  Henry ſuſpectyng this to bee but fraude, after that he ſaw none of his ſhippes apered, hoyſed vp the ſatles, hauyng a meruelous good wynde euen apoynted hym of God to delyuer hym from that great ieopardy, and ſayled backe agayn into Nor mandy. And after his landyng there, he and his

compaignie after their laboures, areſted theim for the ſpace of .iii. dayes, determynyng to go from thence afoote into Brytayne, &amp; in the meane while ſent meſſengers vnto Charles the Frenche kynge the ſonne of Lewes that a lytle before departed, be ſechyng hym of lybertee and lycence to paſſe thorough Normādy into Brytayn. The young kyng Charles beeyng ſory for his fortune, was not onlye ready and well pleaſed to graunt his paſſage, but alſo ſent hym moneye to helpe hym foorthe in his iourneye. But Henry before that he knewe the kynges mynde (not doubtyng of his great humanytee and gentlenes) had ſent awaye his ſhippes towardes Britayne and had ſet hym ſelfe forwardes in his iourneye, but made no greate haſte tyll the meſſengers retourned, whiche greate gentlenes when he receaued from the kyng, reioyſed his hearte and with a luſtye ſtomacke and good hope ſet forwarde into Brytayne, there to take ferther counſayle of his affayres.
                  And when he was in Brytayn, he receaued frō his frendes out of Englande knowledge that the duke of Buckyngham was behedded, and that the Marques of Dorceſtre with a greate nombre of ye noble men of Englande had bene there a lytle before to ſeke hym, and that they wer now in Veneti a cytie in Brytayne. The whiche thynges beynge knowen to the erle, he on the one parte did greately lament the death and euel chaunce of his chiefe and princypall frende, but yet on the other parte he greatlye reioyſed in that he had ſo many &amp; noble menne to take his parte in the battayll. And therfore conceauynge a good hope and opinion

that his purpoſe ſhoulde well frame and come to paſſe, determyned with hym ſelfe with all expedycion to ſet foorth warde, and therupon wente to a place in Brytayn called Rhedon, and from thence ſent to the Marques with all the other noble men that they ſhould come vnto hym. Then when they hearde that Henrye was ſafe returned into Brytayne reioyſed not a lytle, for thei had thought he had landed in Englande, and ſo fallen into the handes of kyng Richarde, and they made not a lytle haſte tyll they wer come vnto hym. The whiche when they met, after greatloye and gladneſſe aſwell of their parte as of his, they began to talke of their prepenſed matters, and nowe was Chriſtmaſſe come, on the whiche daye they altogether aſſembled in the churche and there ſware fayth and truthe one to another. And Henry ſware firſt, promyſyng that aſſone as he ſhould poſſeſſe ye croune of England, that he woulde marye Elyzabeth the doughter of Edward the .iiii. and after warde they ſware feaultie &amp; homage vnto hym euē as though he had already bene kyng, and ſo from that tyme foorthe dyd take hym, promyſyng hym that thei would ſpende bothe their lyfes and goodes with hym, &amp; that Richard ſhould no lēger reigne ouer theim. When this was dooen, Henry declared all theſe thynges to the duke of Britayne, praiynge &amp; deſyryng hym nowe of helpe, and that he woulde ayde hym with a greater nombre of menne, &amp; alſo to lende hym a frendly &amp; honeſt ſomme of moneye that he might nowe recouer his right and enheritaunce of the croune of England, vnto yt which he was called &amp; deſyred by al the lordes &amp; nobilitee of

the realme, &amp; whiche (God wyllyng) he was moſte aſſured to poſſeſſe, and after his poſſeſſiō he would moſte faythfully reſtore the ſame again. The duke promyſed hym ayde, vpon the truſte wherof, he beganne to make redye his ſhippes that they might with all expedicion bee redy to ſayle that no tyme ſhould be loſte. In the whiche tyme kyng Richard was agayn retourned to London, &amp; had taken dyuerſe of theim yt wer of this conſpyracy, yt is to ſay George Browne, Roger Clyfforde, Thomas Selenger, knyghtes. Alſo Thomas Ramme, Robert Clyfford and dyuerſe other whom he cauſed to be put to death.
                  After this he called a parliament wherin was deereed, that all thoſe that were fled oute of the lande ſhould be reputed and taken as enemyes to the realme, and all their landes and goodes to bee forfayte and confiſcate. And not content with that preade which was no ſmal thyng, he cauſed alſo a great taxe and ſome of monye to be leuyed of the people. For ye large giftes and lyberalytee that he firſt vſed to buye the fauoures &amp; frendſhippes of many, had now brought him in nede. But nothing was more like then yt Thomas Stanley ſhoulde haue bene reputed &amp; takē for one of thoſe enemies becauſe of the woorkyng of Margarete his wife which was mother vnto Henry erle of Richemoūt the which was noted for ye chiefe hed &amp; worker of this cōſpyracy. But for aſmuch as it was thought that it was to ſmall purpoſe that wemen coulde dooe: Thomas beynge nothyng fauty was dely

                     ed and cōmaūded that he ſhould not ſuffre Margarete his wyfe to haue any ſeruaūtes about her,

neither yt ſhe ſhould not go abroad but be ſhut vp and yt from thence foorth ſhe ſhould ſende no meſſage neyther to her ſoonne nor to any of her other frendes, wherby any hurte mighte be wrought agaynſt the kyng, the whiche commaundemēt was accomplyſhed. And by the authoryte of the ſame perliament, a peace was concluded with the Scottes, whiche a lytle before had ſkyrmyſhed with the borderers. Which thyng brought to paſſe, ye kyng ſuppoſed all conſpiracye to bee clene auoyded, for aſmuche as the duke with other of his compaignie were put to death, and alſo certen other bannyſhed. Yet for all this, kyng Richard was daylye vexed and troubled, partelye myſtruſtynge his owne ſtrength, and partely fearyng the commyng of Henrye with his compaignye, ſo that he lyued but in a myſerable caſe. And becauſe that he would not ſo continue any lenger, he determyned with hym ſelfe to put awaye the cauſe of this his feare and buſyneſſe, either by pollecye or elles by ſtrength. And after that he hadde thus purpoſed with hym ſelfe, he thought nothyng better then to tempte the duke of Britayn yet once again eyther with money, prayer or ſome other ſpeciall rewarde becauſe yt he had in kepyng the erle Henry, &amp; moſte chiefly, becauſe he knewe yt it was only he yt might delyuer hym from all his trouble by delyueryng or impriſoning the ſayed Henry. Wherfore incontmentlye he ſente vnto the duke certein Ambaſſadoures, the whiche ſhould promeſſe vnto hym beſyde other greate rewardes that they broughte with theim, to geue hym yerely all the reuenues of all the landes of Henry and of all the other lordes

there beyng with hym, yf he woulde after the receyte of the ambaſſadoures put theim in pryſone. The Ambaſſadoures beynge departed and come where the duke laye could not haue communicacion with hym, for aſmuch as by extreme ſickneſſe his wyttes were feble and weake. Wherfore one Peter Landoſe his Treaſourer a manne bothe of pregnaunte wytte and of greate authoritee, tooke this matter in hand. For whiche cauſe he was afterwarde hated of all the lordes of Britain. With this Peter the Engliſhe ambaſſadoures had communicacion, &amp; declaring to hym the kynges meſſage deſyred hym inſtantlye, for aſmuche as they knewe that he might bring theyr purpoſe to paſſe that he woulde graunt vnto kyng Richardes requeſt, and he ſhoulde haue the yerely reuenues of all the landes of the ſayed lordes. Peter conſidering that he was greatly hated of ye lordes of his owne nacion, thoughte that yf he myght bring to paſſe thoroughe kyng Richarde to haue all theſe greate poſſeſſyons and yerely reuenues, he ſhould then bee hable to matche with theim well ynough and not to care a ruſhe for theim, whereupon he aunſwered the ambaſſadoures that he would doo that Richard dyd deſire, yf he brake not promeſſe with hym. And this did he not for any hatred that he bare vnto Henry, for he hated hym not, for not longe before he ſaued his lyfe where the earle Henry was in greate 
                        •
                     eoperdye. But ſuche was the good fortune of Englande, that this craftye compacte tooke no place, for whyle the letters and meſſengers ranne betwene Peter and kyng Kichard, Iohn Biſhoppe of Ely beinge then in Flaundres

was certifyed by a preeſt whiche came oute of England whoſe name was Chriſtopher Vrſwicke of all the whole circumſtaunce of this deuyce &amp; purpoſe. Wherupon with all ſpede the ſayed byſhop cauſed the ſaied preeſt the ſame daye to cary know ledge therof into Britayn to Henry erle of Richemounte willing hym with all the other noble men to dyſpatche theim ſelues wt all poſſible haſte into Fraunce, Henry was then in Veneti whē he heard of this fraud, without tariaunce ſent Chriſtopher vnto Charles the Frenche kyng deſiring lycence that Henry with the other noble men myght ſafely come into Fraunce, the which thing being ſone obteigned, the meſſenger retourned with ſpede to his lorde and Prince.
                  Then the earle Henry ſetting all his buſineſſe in as good ſtaye &amp; ordre as he mighte, talked lytle and made fewe a counſail herof, &amp; for the more expedicyon hereof, he cauſed therle of Penbrucke ſecretly to cauſe all the noble men to take their horſes, diſſembling to ride vnto the duke of Bretain, but when they came to the vttermoſt partes therof, they ſhould forſake the waye that led theim toward the duke, and to make into Fraunce with all that euer they might. Then they dooing in euery thing as they were biddē loſte no tyme but ſo ſped theim that ſhortely they obteygned and gate into the coūtie of Angeou. Henry then within .ii. dayes folowyng, being then ſtyll at Veneti tooke .iiii. or fyue of his ſeruauntes with hym, and feigned as thoughe he woulde haue ryden therby to viſyte a frende of his, and foraſmuche as there were many Engliſhmenne lefte there in the toune, no manne

ſuſpected any thynge, but after that he had kepte the ryghte waye for the ſpace of fyue myles, he forſooke that and turned ſtreyghte into a woode that was thereby, and tooke vpon hym his ſeruauntes apparell, and putte his apparell vpon hys ſeruaunte, and ſo tooke but one of theym with hym, on whome he waited as thoughe he had bene the ſeruaunte and the other the maiſter. And with all conuenyente and ſpedy haſte ſo ſette forthe on theyr iourney that no tyme was loſte, and made no more tariaunce by the way then onelye the baitynge of theyr horſes, ſo that ſhortly he recouered the coaſtes of Angeou where all his other companye was.
                  But within foure dayes after that the Earle was thus eſcaped. Peter receaued from kyng Richard the confirmacion of the graunte and promiſes made for the betreiyng of Henry and the other nobles. Wherfore the ſaide Peter ſente oute after hym horſes and menne with ſuche expedicion and ſpede to haue taken hym, that ſcacely the erle was entred Fraunce one houre but they were at his heles. The Englyſhe menne then beyng aboue the noumbre of thre hundreth at Veneti, hearing that the Earle and all the nobles were fled ſo ſodeinly and withoute any of their knowledge, were aſtonyed and in maner deſpaired of theyr lyues.
                  But it happened contrary to theyr exſpectacyon for the duke of Britaine taking the matter ſo vnkyndely that Henry ſhould bee ſo vſed with hym that for feare he ſhoulde bee compelled to flee his lande, was not a lytle vexed with Peter, to whom (althoughe that he was ignoraunte of the fraude

and crafte that had been wrought by hym) yet he layed the whole faute in hym, and therfore called vnto hym Edward Poyninges &amp; Edward Wood vile, deliuering vnto theim the foreſayde monye ye Henrye before had deſyred the Duke to lende hym towarde the charge of his iourney, and commaunded theim to conuey and conducte all the Engliſh menne his ſeruauntes vnto hym paying theyr expenſes, and to deliuer the ſayde ſome of monye vn to the earle. When the earle ſawe his menne come and hearde this comfortable newes, he not a lytle reioyſed, deſiring the meſſengers that returned to ſhewe vnto the duke, that he truſted ere long time to ſhewe him ſelfe not to bee vnthankeful for this greate kyndneſſe that he nowe ſhewed vnto hym. And within fewe dayes after, the earle went vnto Charles the French kyng, to whome after he had rendred thankes for the great benefites and kind neſſe that he had receaued of hym, the cauſe of his comming fyrſte declared, then he beſought him of his helpe and ayde, whiche ſhoulde bee an immor tall benefite to hym and his lordes, of whome generallye he was called vnto the kyngdome, foraſmuch as they ſo abhorred the tiranny of kyng Rychard. Charles promiſed hym helpe and bade him to be of good chere &amp; to take no care, for he would gladly declare vnto hym his beneuolence. And the ſame tyme Charles remoued and tooke with hym Henry and all the other noble menne.
                  Whyle Henry remained there, Iohn Earle of Oxenford (of whome is before ſpoken) which was put in priſone by Edward the fourth in the caſtell of Hammes with alſo Iames Blounte Capteine

of that caſtell, and Iohn Forſkewe knyghte Porter of the towne of Caleies, came vnto hym. But Iames the capitain, becauſe he lefte his wife in ye caſtell, dyd furnyſhe the ſame with a good gariſon of men before his departure.
                  Henry when he ſawe therle, was out of meaſure glad ye ſo noble a man and of greate experience in battayl, and ſo valiaunt &amp; hardie a knight, whom he thought to bee moſte feithfull and ſure, for ſomuche as he had in the time of Edward ye fourth, continuall battail with hym in defending of Henry the ſyxte, thought that nowe he was ſo well apointed that he coulde not deſire to bee better, and therfore cōmunicated vnto hym all his whole affaires, to bee ordred and ruled only by hym. Not longe after Charles the Frenche kyng remoued again to Paris, whome Henry folowed, and there againe moued and beſoughte the kyng as he had moſte fauourably &amp; kindely entreteigned hym all this time, not only in wordes, but alſo in dedes yt it would lykewiſe pleaſe hym yet ſo much further to extend his fauoure &amp; beneuolence vnto hym that nowe he woulde ayde and helpe hym forwarde in his iourney, yt not onely he, but alſo all the lordes and nobilytee of Englande myghte iuſtely haue cauſe to knowlage and confeſſe that by the meane of his fauoure and goodneſſe they were reſtored againe to the poſſeſſyon of their enherytaunces, whiche withoute hym they coulde not well bryng to paſſe.
                  In the meane while, his fortune was ſuche, ye many Englyſhe menne came ouerdaylye oute of Englande vnto him, and many whiche then were

in Paris, amonge whome were diuerfe ſtudentēs that fell vnto his parte bothe more and leſſe, and ſpecially there was one, whoſe name was Richard Foxe a Preeſt, beyng a manne of a ſynguler good wytte and learning, whome Henry ſtreyght waye reteigned and cōmitted all his ſecretes vnto hym and whome alſo afterward he promoted to many hyghe promocyons, and at the laſte he made hym biſhop of Wincheſter.
                  Richarde then hearyng of all this conſpiracye and of the greate ayde that dayly wente ouer vnto Henry, thought yet for all this, that if he might bring to paſſe that Henry ſhould not couple in maryage with the blood of king Edwarde, that then he ſhoulde dooe well ynoughe with hym and kept hym from the poſſeſſyon of the croune. Then deuyſed he with hym ſelfe all the wayes and meanes that myghte bee howe to bryng this to paſſe. And fyrſte he thoughte it to bee beſte with fayre woordes &amp; large promeſſes to attempte the quene whoſe fauoure obteygned, he doubted not but ſhortelye to fynde the meanes to haue bothe her doughters oute of her handes into his owne, and then reſted nothynge but yf he hym ſelfe myghte fynde the meanes after warde to marye one of the ſame doughters, whereby he thought he ſhoulde make all ſure and ſafe to the vtter diſapoyntinge of Henrye. Wherupon he ſente vnto the Quene then beynge in the Sanctuarye dyuerſe and ſondrye meſſengers that ſhoulde excuſe and pourge hym of his facte afore dooen towardes her, ſettynge forthe the matter with pleſaunte woordes and hye promyſes bothe to her and alſo her ſonne

Thomas lorde Marques of Dorſet, of all thynges that coulde be deſyred. Theſe meſſengers beyng men of grauitee, handled the quene ſo e
                        ••
                     ftly that anone ſhe beganne to bee alured and to herken vnto theim fauourably, ſo that in concluſion ſhe promyſed to be obedient to the kyng in his requeſt (forgettyng the iniuries he had dooen to her before, and on the other parte not remembryng ye promeſſe that ſhe made to Maigarete Henryes mother.) And firſt ſhe delyuered both her doughters into the handes of kyng Rychard, then after ſhe ſent preuely for the Lorde Marques her ſonne beyng then at Parys wt Henry (as ye haue heard) wyllyng hym to forſake Henrye with whome he was, and ſpedely to returne into Englande for all thynges was perdoned and forgeuen, &amp; ſhe again in fauoure and frendſhip of ye kyng, and it ſhould be highly for his aduauncement and honoure.
                  Kyng Richard (whē quene Elizabeth was thus brought into a fooles paradyce) after he had receaued al his brothers doughters from the ſanctuary into his palayce, thought there nowe remayned nothyng to be dooen, but only the caſtyng awaye and deſtroiyng of his owne wife, whiche thynge he had wholy purpoſed and decreed within hym ſelfe. And there was nothyng that feared hym ſo much from this mooſte cruell &amp; deteſtable murder as the loſyng of the good opynion ye he thought the people had conceyued of hym, for as ye haue heard before, he faigned hym ſelfe to be a good mā and thought the people had eſtemed hym euen ſo. Notwithſtandyng ſhortly after, his foreſaide vngracious purpoſe, ouercame al this honeſt feare.

And firſt of all, he abſteyned from beddyng or lyyng with her: and alſo found him ſelf greued with the barrēneſſe of his wife, that ſhe was vnfruteful and brought hym forth no chyldren, complamyng therof very greuouſly vnto ye nobles of his realme and chieflye aboue other vnto Thomas Rotherame then archebiſhoppe of Yorke (whome he had delyuered a lytle afore oute of pryſon) the whiche byſhop did gather of this, that the quene ſhould be rid out of the waye, ere it were long after (ſuche experience had he of kyng Richardes complexciō who had practiſed many lyke thynges not longe before) &amp; theſame tyme alſo he made dyuerſe of his ſecrete frendes preuy of theſame his coniecture.
                  After this, he cauſed a rumoure to ronne amōg the commen people (but he woulde not haue ye autoure knowen) yt the quene was dead, to thentent yt ſhe hearyng this meruelous rumour, ſhould take ſo greueous a conceyt that anone after ſhe ſhould fall into ſome great diſeaſe, ſo that he would aſſay that waye, in caſe it ſhould chaunce her afterward to be ſicke, dead or otherwyſe murdred, that then ye people might impute her death vnto ye thought ſhe tooke or els to ye ſickeneſſe. But whē the quene heard of ſo horryble a rumour of her death ſprōge abroade among the commen people, ſhe ſuſpected the matter and ſuppoſed the worlde to be at an ende with her, and incontinently, ſhe wente to the kyng with a lamentable countenaunce, and with wepyng teares aſked hym, whether ſhe had dooen any thyng whereby he might iudge her worthy to ſuffer death. The kyng made aunſwere with a ſmilyng and diſſimulyng countenaūce and with flatteryng

woordes, byddyng her to bee of good comforte and to plucke vp her heart for there was no ſuche thyng toward her that he knewe. But howe ſo euer it fortuned, either by ſorowe or els by poyſonyng, within fewe daies after, the quene was dedde and afterwarde was buryed in the abbay of Weſtminſter. This is the ſame Anne, one of Rychard the earle of Warwikes doughters whiche once was cōtracted to prince Edwarde kyng Hē
                     ry the ſixt his ſoonne.
                  The kyng beyng thus delyuered of his wife fantaſied a pace ladye Elizabeth his nice, deſiryng in any wiſe to mary with her: but becauſe that all menne, yee and the mayden her ſelf abhorred this vnlawfull deſire, as a thyng mooſte deteſtable, he determined with hym ſelf to make no greate haſt in the matter, chiefly for that he was in a pecke of troubles, fearyng leaſt yt of the noble menne ſome would forſake hym &amp; runne vnto Henry his part, the other at the leſte would fauoure the ſecrete conſpiracy made again hym, ſo that of his ende there was almooſt no doubte. Alſo the more parte of the commen people were in ſo greate diſpeare, that many of theim had rather to bee accompted in the noumbre of his enemies, then to put theim ſelfes in ieopardy bothe of loſſe of body and goodes in takyng of his parte.
                  And emongeſt thoſe noble menne whom he feared, firſt was Thomas Standley and Wyllyam his brother, Gylbert Talbote, &amp; of other a greate noūbre, of whoſe purpoſe▪ though kyng Rychard was ignoraunt, neuertheleſſe he truſted not one of theim, and leſt of all Thomas Standley, becauſe

he had maryed Henryesanother, as it maye well appeare by this that fol oweth. For when the ſayd Thomas woulde haue departed from the courte vnto his owne manſion for his recreacion (as he ſaide) but ye truthe was, becauſe he woulde bee in a readyneſſe to receaue Henry and ayde hym at his commyng into the realme. But the kyng did let hym, and would not ſuffer hym to departe, vntyll ſuche tyme he had left in the courte behynde hym George Strange his ſoonne and heyre for a pledge. And whyle kynge Richarde was thus wrapped in feare and care of ye tumulte that was to come, lo, euen then tydynges came that Henrye was entred into the lande, and that the caſtell of Hammes was prepared to receiue Henry, by the meanes of the erle of Oxenforde whiche then was fled with Iames Blunte keper of the caſtell vnto Henry.
                  Then kyng Rychard, thynkyng at the begynnyng to ſtey all this matter, ſent forth with all haſt 
                        •
                     he greater parte that were then at Calyce to recouer the ſaid caſtell again. Thoſe that were in the caſtell, when thei ſawe their aduerſaries make towardes theim, ſpedely thei armed theim ſelfes to defence and in al haſt ſent meſſengers to Hēry, deſyryng hym of ayde. Henry forthwith ſent the erle of Oxenforde with a choſen ſorte of menne to aſſiſt theim, and at their firſt commyng they laid ſiege not farre from the caſtell. And whyle kyng Rychardes menne turned backe hauyng an yie towardes theim: Thomas Brandon with thirty valeaunt menne of the otherſide gate ouer a water in to the caſtell, to ſtrength theim that were

within. Then thei that were within laid heard to their charge that were without, on ye otherſide, the erle of Oxenford ſo valiantly aſſayled them of the backeſide that thei were glad to make proclamaciō to theim that were within, that if thei would be content to geue ouer the caſtell, thei ſhould haue free liberte to departe with all that euer thei had. The erle of Oxenforde hearyng this, whiche came onely to ſaue his frendes from hurte, and namely Iames Bluntes wife, was contented with this condicion and departed in ſaufgarde with all his frendes returning backe to Henry, whiche was at Paris. After this, kyng Rychard was informed yt the Frenche kyng was wery of Henry &amp; his compaignie, and would doo nothyng for hym, wherby Henry was nowe not hable in maner to helpe him ſelf, ſo that it was not poſſible yt he ſhuld preuaile or goo forwarde in thenterpriſe that he thoughte to haue taken in hande agaynſt kynge Rycharde.
                  Kynge Rycharde beeyng brought thus into a falſe paradice, thought hym ſelfe to bee out of all feare, and that there was no cauſe why he ſhould beynge ſo ſure, ones to wake oute of hys ſlepe or trouble hym ſelfe any furder, and therefore called backe hys nauye of ſhyppes that then was redy vpon the ſea, whyche was fullye furnyſhed to haue ſcoured the ſeas. But yet for the more ſuretie leaſt he ſhould bee ſodenly oppreſſed, he gaue commaundemente to the greatte men dwellynge by the ſea ſyde (and ſpecyally the Welſhemen) to watche nyghte and daye, leaſte his aduerſaries ſhuld haue eny oportunitee to entre into the lande. As the faſhyon is in time of warre that thoſe that

dwell by the ſees ſide ſhould make bekyns in the higheſt places there about, whiche might bee ſene afarre of, ſo that when it ſhould chaunce their enemyes to aryue towarde the lande, by and by they ſhould fyre theyr bekyns and rayſe the countreye, to thentent that quickely from place to place they might be aſcerteyned of all the whole matter and alſo to arme theim ſelfes ſpedelye agaynſte theyr enemies.
                  And ſo to come to our purpoſe agayn, kyng Richard thorough the aforeſaide tydynges, beganne to bee more careleſſe and recheleſſe, as who ſaye, he had no power to withſtand the deſteny that honge ouer his hedde. Suche is the prouydent iuſtyce of God, that a manne dooeth leſte knowe, prouyde &amp; beware when the vengeaunce of God is euen at hande for his offences. And to go forth, at ye tyme when Henry the earle of Richemounte remayned in Fraunce entretyng and ſuyng for ayde &amp; helpe of the Frenche men, many of the chiefe noble men, which had the realme in gouernaunce (becauſe of the young age of Charles the kyng) fel ſomewhat at diſſencion, of the whiche variaunce, Lewes the prynce of Orlyaunce was the chiefe and hedde, whiche becauſe he had maryed Iohanne the kynges ſyſter looked to haue bene chiefe gouernoure of all the realme. By the which meanes it came to paſſe, that no one man had the princypall gouernaunce of the realme. And therefore Henry the erle was conſtraigned to ſue vnto all the nobles ſeuerallye one after another deſyrynge and praiynge theim of aide and helpe in his purpoſe, and thus the matter was prolonged. In the meane tyme

Thomas the Marques of Dorcet (of whome we ſpake afore) was preuely ſent for to come home by his mother, partely myſtruſtynge that Henrye ſhould not preuayle, and partly for the greate and large promeſſes that kyng Richard had made to her for hym before. Whiche letters when the ſayd Marques had receaued, he beleuyng all thynges that his mother wrote vnto hym, and alſo thynkyng that Henry ſhould neuer preuayle, and that the Frenchemen did but mocke and daylye with hym: he ſodeynly in the night tyme conueyed hym ſelfe out of Parys and with great ſpede made towardes Flaūders. The whiche thyng when ye erle and other of the Engliſhe lordes heard of, thei wer ſore aſtonned &amp; amaſed, &amp; with all ſpede purchaſed of Charles the kyng a lycence and commaundement that the Marques might by ſteyed wherſoeuer he wer found wt in the dominion of Fraūce chiefly for that he was ſecrete of their councel and knewe all there purpoſe. The cōmaundemēt was quickly obteyned &amp; poſtes made forth euery waye, emōgeſt whom one Humfrey Cheyncy plaiyng ye parte of a good blooddehounde ſo truely, ſmelled out and folowed the trace, that by and by he found out and toke the Marques: and ſo handled &amp; perſuaded hym with gentle and good woordes, that ſhortely after he was content to retourne.
                  Then Henry beyng delyuered of this chaunce, thought it beſt to prolonge the matter no farther leaſt he ſhould looſe both the preſent oportunytee and alſo wery his frendes that looked for hym in Englande. Wherfore he made haſte and ſet forewarde with a ſmall army obteyned of the Frenche

kyng, of whom he alſo borowed ſome money, and ſome of other of his frendes, for the whiche he left the Marques and Ihon Burchere behynde for a pledge. And ſo ſetting forward came to Roan, and whyle he taryed there and prepared ſhippyng at ye hauen of Seyne, tydynges cam to hym ye kyng: Richardes wyfe was deade, &amp; purpoſed to mary with the lady Elyſabeth, kyng Edwardes eldeſt doughter being his nice, &amp; that he had maried Cycile her ſyſter to a mannes ſonne of the lāde far vnderneth her degre. At the whiche thyng, Henry was ſore amaſed and troubled, thynkyng that by this meanes al his purpoſe was daſhed, for that there was no other waye for hym to come to the kyngdome but only by the maryage of one of kyng Edwardes doughters. And by this menes alſo, he feared leaſt his frendes in Englande would ſhrynke frō hym for lacke of an honeſt title. But after thei had conſulted vpon the matter, thei thought it beſt to cary a lytle to proue if they might gette more helpe and make mo frendes. And among all other, they thought it beſt to adioyne the lord Harbarte vnto theim, whiche was a mā of great power in Wales and yt ſhould be brought to paſſe by this meanes, for that the lorde Harbarte had a ſyſter maryable, whō Henry would be content to mary, if he would take their part. And to brīg al this matter to paſſe meſſengers were ſent to Henry the erle of Northhumberlande, whiche had maryed the other ſyſter ſo that he ſhould bryng this matter about, but the wayes were ſo beſet that the meſſengers could not come to hym.
                  And in the meane ſeaſon, came veray good tydynges

from Ihon ap Morgan a temporall lawyer, whiche ſignified vnto theim that ſyr Ryce ap Thomas a noble and valiaunt man and Ihon Sauage, fauoured his parte earneſtlye and alſo ſyr Reynolde Braye had prepared a greate ſumme of mony to wage battayl on his parte and to helpe hym, and therfore he woulde they ſhould make haſt with all that euer they could, and make towarde Wales.
                  Then Henry ſpedely prepared hym ſelfe becauſe he would lynger his frendes no lenger. And after that he had made his prayer vnto almightye God that he might haue good ſucceſſe in his iourney, only with two thouſande menne and a fewe ſhyppes in the calendes of Auguſt he ſayled from the hauen of Seyne, and the ſeuēth daye after whiche was the .xxii. daye of Auguſt, he aryued in Wales aboute ſonne ſet &amp; lāded at Wilforde hauen, &amp; in ye parte whiche is called the Dale, where he hearde yt there was dyuerſe layde in wayte for hym, to kepe hym backe. From thence, in the mornyng betymes he remoued towarde a towne called Harford with in tēne myle of the Dale, where he was very ioyfully receyued. Here he had contrarye tydynges brought to that he hearde in Normādy afore, that ſyr Ryce ap Thomas and Ihon Sauage wythal that euer they coulde make, were of kyng Richardes parte.
                  Notwithſtandynge, they had ſuche tydynges ſent theim frō the menne of Pembruche by a valiaūt gentlemā, whoſe name was Arnold Butteler, that it reioyſed all their heartes, whiche was, that

yf all former offences might bee remitted, they woold bee in a redyneſſe to ſticke vnto there owne Geſpare the erle. Then Henryes company by this meanes beeyng encreaſed, departed frō Harforde fyue myle towarde Cardygane, and then while he refreſhed his menne, ſodenly came a rumoure vnto hym that the lorde Harbarte whiche dwelled at Carmerdyne was nye at hande with a greate armye of menne. At the whiche rumoure there was a greate ſturre amongeſte theim, euerye manne tooke hym ſelfe to his weapon and made theim ſelfes redye if nede were, to fight, and a lytle while they were all afrayed, tyl ſuch tyme as Henrye had ſent out horſemen to trye ye truthe, whiche when thei came agayn, declared that all thynges was quiet and that ther was no ſuche thyng. But moſte of all maſter Gryffythes a verye noble man did conforte theim and gladden their heartes, whiche although before he had ioyned hym ſelf to the lorde Harberte, at that very tyme he cleued to Henry with ſuche companye as he had, although they were but fewe, and theſame tyme came Ihon ap Morgā vnto hym. Henry went ſtyll forward &amp; caried almoſte in no place, becauſe he would make ſuer woorke and the better ſpede, he inuaded ſuche places afore that thei were armed againſt hym, ye whiche places he bette downe wt very litle ſtrēgth But afterward hauyng knowlage by his ſpyes ye the lorde Harbert &amp; ſyr Ryce were in a redynes to geue hym battail he determyned to ſet vpō theim, &amp; either to put theim to flight orels to make theim ſweare homage and feaultee vnto hym, &amp; to take theim wt hym in his hoſte againſt kyng Richard.

And becauſe he woulde aſcertayne his frendes in Englande howe all the matter went forwad with hym, he ſent of his mooſt truſtye frendes to ladye Margarete his mother, to Standely, to Talbot, and to other of his moſt eſpecial frendes with certain commaundementes. The effecte of the commaundementes were, that he intended with the helpe of hys frendes to paſſe ouer Seuerne and by Shreweſbury to make toward London. Ther fore he deſyred theim with thoſe that were of their councell in tyme &amp; place conuenient to mete hym. So the meſſaungers going forth with theſe commiſſyons: Henry went forward toward Shreweſbury, and in the waye mette with ſyr Rice ap Thomas with a great noumber of menne which came vnto hym and was of his parte. For two dayes afore Henry promyſed hym to bee chiefe ruler of all Wales as ſoone as he came to the croune (yf he would come vnto hym) which afterward he gaue to hym in dede. In the meane time the meſſengers executing the meſſage, diligētly returned back agayne with large rewardes of theim, to whome they were ſent and came to Henry the ſame day he entred into Shreweſburye and ſhewed howe all his frendes were in a redyneſſe to dooe the vttermoſte that laye in theim. This tidynges put Henry in ſuche greate hope, that he went forth with a courage and came to the towne of Newporte and there ſet vp his tentes vpon a lytle hyll, and there laye all night. That night came to hym ſyr Gylberte Talbot with aboue two hundreth menne.
                  After that they went forthe to Stafforde &amp; whyle they were there, Willyam Standley came to hym

with a fewe after hym, and when he had talked a litle with him, retourned backe again to his hoſte whiche he had prepared. From thence he went to Lichfelde, and that nyght laye without the toune, but in ye morning betime he entred into ye citee and was receiued honourably. A daye or .ii. afore, Thomas Standley was there with fyue. M. men armed, whiche when he knewe of Henries cōming, forthwith went afore to a village called Aderſtone there to tarye tyll Henrye came. This he dyd to auoide ſuſpicion, beyng afraid leaſt kyng Richard knowing his intent would haue put his ſoonne to deathe, whiche as I telled you before was lefte wt hym as a pledge for his father. But kynge Rychard in the meane tyme, which then was at Nottingham, hearing that Henry with a fewe more of baniſhed men was entred into Wales, ſo lightly regarded the matter, that he thoughte it was not muche to bee paſte vpon, for that he came in with ſo fewe in noumbre, and that the lorde Harbart &amp; ſir Rice, which wer rulers of all Wales, would other kyll hym, or elles take hym and bring hym aliue. But afterward, when he remembred him ſelf that oftentimes a ſmal matter in batel if it bee not looked vnto betymes, would make at the laſte a great ſturre: he thought it beſt to remedy the matter betimes and commaunded Henrye the earle of Northumberlande with other of the nobles of the realme (whome he thoughte had ſet more by hym then by their owne goodes) to rayſe vp an army &amp; to come to hym with ſpeede. Alſo he ſente dyuers meſſengers with letters to Robert Brakenburye keper of the Towre of London, commaundynge

hym to come vnto hym in all haſte, and to brynge with hym as felowes in battell, Thomas Burſchere, Walter Hungerforde and dyuerſe other knyghtes, whome he dyd not a litell ſuſpecte.
                  In this tyme it was ſhewed that Henrye was come to Shrewiſburye without any hurte. With the which tidinges, ye kyng beganne to rage and made exclamacion againſte theim, that contrary to their faithes they had vtterly deceiued hym, &amp; then he beganne to miſtruſt all menne, and wiſte not whome he mighte truſte, ſo that he thoughte it beſt to ſette forthe hym ſelfe ageinſt his aduerſaryes. And forthwith he ſent out ſpies to knowe which waye Henry did take. They when they had dooen their diligence retourned backe again and ſhewed hym howe that Henry was come to Lichfeld. The which thing after he knew, becauſe now there was a greate noumbre of ſouldyours come together, by and by his menne ſet in araye, he commaunded theim forwarde, and to gooe foure and foure together, and by that waye which they kept they hearde ſaye, their enemies were commynge. The ſuſpecte perſones he putte in the myddes, he hym ſelfe with thoſe he truſted came behind, with winges of horſemen running on euery ſyde. And thus keping their order, aboute ſonne ſette came vnto Leiceſtre.
                  When Henrye in the meane ſeaſon had remoued from Lichefelde vnto the nexte village called Tamworth, in the mydwaye he mette with Walter Hungerforde, Thomas Burſchier and many other more which had promiſed to aide hym afore And forbecauſe they perceyued that they were ſuſſpected

of Richard, &amp; leaſt they ſhould be brought violentlye vnto hym beyng their enemye they forſooke Robert Brakenbury their capitaine, and in the nyghte tyme ſtale priuely awaye and wente to Henry. Vnto whome there chaunced by the waye that was worthy to bee marked, whiche was that Henry, althoughe he was a manne of noble courage and alſo his companye dyd dailye encreaſe, yet for all that he ſtoode in great feare becauſe he was vncertayne of Thomas Standly whiche as I telled you before, for the feare of puttynge his ſoonne to deathe, inclyned as yet vnto no parte, &amp; that the matter was not ſo ſlēder of kyng Richard as reporte was made to hym of his frendes.
                  Wherfore, as all afrayde withoute a cauſe, he tooke onely twenty menne with him, and ſteyed in his iourney as a manne in diſpaire and halfe muſynge with hym ſelfe what was beſte to bee dooen, and to aggrauate the matter, tidinges was broughte hym that kyng Richard was comming nere to mete hym with a great and houge hoſte of menne. And while he thus lyngered for feare behinde, his hoſte came afore to the toune of Tham worth, and becauſe it was then darke night, he loſt bothe his company and alſo his waye, then wandryng frome place to place, at laſte came to a lytle village .iii. myle from his hoſte being full of feare and leſte he ſhould fall into the daunger of ſcoute watche he durſte not aſke a queſtyon of any man, and partly for the feare that was preſente, partely for that was to come he laye there that nyght and tooke this for a ſygne or a pronoſticacyon of ſome greate plage that was to come, and of the other

parte his hoſte was no leſſe abaſhed ſeyng his abſence for that tyme. When in the morning Henry came to theim in the light of the daye he excuſed ye matter that he was not abſent becauſe he had loſt his waye but rather of purpoſe, becauſe he would commen wt his preuy frendes which would not be ſene in the daye. After yt he went priuely to Aderſtone where Thomas Standley &amp; Willyam his brother dyd dwell. Here Henry, Thomas, &amp; Willyam mette and tooke other by the hande with louing ſalutacions and were glad one of an other. Then after, they counceled together of their metyng with kyng Richard whome they perceyued then not to bee farre from theim. That day when it drewe toward night, in the euening Ihon Sauage Brytanne Sanforde, Simon Digby with many other had forſaken, kyng Richarde &amp; came to Henry wt a great power of men, whiche thyng both with power and ſtrengthe ſate Henry alofte again. In the meane ſeaſon kyng Richard which purpoſed to go
                        •
                      thorow thicke and thinne in this mater came to Boſworthe alitell beyond Leiceſtre where the place of batell ſhould bee (as a manne would ſaye the hye iuſtice of God, whiche coulde not bee auoided hanging ouer his hed, had called hym to a place where he ſhould ſuffer worthy punyſhemente for his deteſtable offenees) and there he ſette vp his tentes and reſted that night. Afore he went to bed he made an oration to his companye with greate vehemence, perſwading &amp; exhorting manfully to fight. And afterward, as it was ſaied he had a terrible dreame in his ſlepe ſeming that he ſawe horrible deuilles appere vnto hym &amp;

pulling and haling of hym that he coulde take no reſt, which viſyon fylled hym full of feare &amp; alſo of heuy care when he waked. For by and by after, being ſore greued in his minde, he did prognoſticate of this dreame the euill luke &amp; heuy chaunce that after came to hym, and he came not with ſo cherful a countenaunce vnto his company as he was wonte to dooe. Then leeſt they ſhould thinke that he had this heauineſſe for the feare of his enemies he ſtoode vp &amp; reherſed vnto theim all his dreame. But I thinke that this was not a dreame, but rather his conſcience pricked with the ſharpe ſtynge of his miſcheuous offences, which although they dooe not pricke alwaye, yet moſt cōmenly they wil byte moſte towarde the latter daye, repreſentyng vnto vs not onely them ſelfe, but alſo the terryble punyſhement that is ordeined for the ſame, as the ſyghte of the deuill tearyng and haling vs, ſo that therby (if we haue grace) we may take an occaſyon to bee penitēt, or elles for lacke of the ſame dye in deſperacyon. Nowe to come to my purpoſe again, the nexte daye after, kyng Richard hauing all thynges in a redyneſſe went for the with the army oute of his tentes, &amp; beganne to ſette his men in araye: fyrſt the forward ſet forth with a meruelous lengthe bothe of horſemen and alſo of footemen, a veray terrible companye to theim yt ſhould ſee theim a farre of: and in the formoſt parte of all he ordered the bowmen as a ſtronge fortreſſe for theim that came after, and ouer this Iohn ye duke of Norffolke was hedde capitaine. After hym folowed the kyng with a mightye ſorte of menne. And in this while, Henry beyng departed from ye
                     
communicacion of his frendes without any tariyng pytched his tentes nere his enemies and laye there all nighte and cōmaunded his men to bee in a redineſſe, in the morninge he ſente alſo to Thomas Standley being then in the middes, betwixt bothe hoſtes that he ſhould come nere with his armye. He ſent hym woorde again that he ſhould ſet his menne in an ordre tyll he came, with the which anſwer otherwiſe then he had thought or then the mater dyd require, he was not alitel abaſhed and ſtoode as it were in doubte. Yet for all yt he taryed not but with all ſpede ſet his menne in an ordre, ye forward was but ſlender, becauſe his noūber was but fewe, the archers were ſet in the formoſt parte Ouer theim Iohn the earle of Oxford was hedde capitain. In the ryght wing he ſette Gilbert Talbot. In ye lefte he put Iohn Sauage. And he him ſelfe with ye helpe of Thomas Standley folowed with one companye of horſemen and a fewe footemen, for all his whole company were ſcāt fyue. M beſides ye bothe Stanleys with their company, of the which Willyam Standley had thre. M. The kinges army was double to all this. And ſo when bothe armyes were all in a redineſſe and beganne for to come within the ſight of other they bragged forth theim ſelfes of bothe parties, looking onely for the ſygne and token of ſtriking together. Betwyxte bothe hoſtes, there was a marreſſe whiche Henrye lefte on his ryghte hande purpoſelye as a defence of his menne, he found the meanes alſo to haue the bryght ſunne on his backe, that it myght daſyll the eyes of his enemyes.
                  But the Kyng when the ſawe Henry paſſe ouer

the marras cōmaunded his men with all violence to ſet vpon theim. They by and by with a ſodein clamour lette arrowes flee at theim. On the other ſyde they paied theim home manfully again with the ſame. But when they came nere together they laied on valeauntly with ſwerdes. The earle of Oxforde fearing leaſt in the meane time kyng Richardes multytude ſhould haue compaſſed in his menne whiche wer but a fewe, he cōmaunded theim by fyues they ſhould not moue forwarde paſte ten fote the whiche cōmaundement knowen when they knitte theim ſelfes together and ſeaſed not in fyghting: their aduerſaries beyng afrayed ſuſpected ſom crafte or guyle &amp; began to breake of and many of the ſame parte wer not much greued therwith, becauſe they wer as glad ye king ſhould be loſte as ſaued, &amp; therfore they fought with leſſe courage. Then the erle of Oxford with his menne thicke together ſtroke on more freſhlyer. The other of the other parte dyd likwyſe the ſame. And while the firſte wardes of the batell had fought ſo manfully. Richard perceiued by his ſpies Henry a farre of with a fewe companye of armed menne. Afterward, cōming nere, Richard knewe hym by ſygnes and tokens, then being inflamed with anger, furiouſlye ſtroke the horſe with the ſpurres and ranne out of the one ſyde of the hoſte, and like a Lyon ranne at hym. On the other ſyde, Henry perceiuing hym commyng, was very deſyrouſe to mete hym. Richard at the fyrſte ſetting forth, kylled diuers that ſtode, again he threwe doune Henry his banner and Willyam Brandon the bearer alſo, he ranne at Cheyny a manne of great mighte

whiche came for to mete hym, and with greate violēce ouerthrewe hym to the grounde, and this he made hymſelf awaie through theim, for to come to Henry. But Henry kept better tacke with hym thē his men would haue thought, whiche thē was allmoſte in deſpayre of the victory. And euē at ye tyme lo there came Wyllyam Stanley to aide theim wt .iii. M. mēne, and euen at the verie ſame tyme the reſidue of kyng Richardes men were put to flight Thē Richard fightyng alone in the middeſt of all his enemies was ouerthrowne &amp; ſlain. In ye meane tyme therle of Oxēford in ye foreward after he had fought māfully a litle while, put ye reſidue to flight of whō he ſlewe a greate nōbre. But agreate nombre more whiche folowed Richard more for feare then for loue, helde their handes from fightyng &amp; went awaie without hurte, for that thei loked not for his ſafegard, but rather for his deſtruccion. There were ſlain at this conflicte not many more then one thouſand, of the whiche theſe were noble menne. Ihon duke of Norffolke Walter Feris Robert Brachyngbury, Richard Radcliffe and many other more. And within twoo daies after Wyllyam Catiſby lawyer with certain other of his felowes was put to death at Leiceſtre, and emonges thoſe ye ranne awaie, was Fraunces Louell, Humfray Stafford, with Thomas his brother and other more that ranne into ſanctuary at Colcheſtre in Eſſex. There was of the captiues a greate nombre, becauſe that when Richard was ſlain, euery manne caſt doune his wepon and yeld hymſelf to Henry, of ye whiche ye more parte would haue dooen ſo at the begynnyng, if it had not been

for feare of kyng Richardes ſpies, whiche thē wā
                     dered in euery place. And emongeſt theſe the nobles, were the erle of Northumberlande the erle of Surrey of the whiche therle of Surrey was put in priſone, this other as a frend was receiued in to fauour. Henry at that felde loſte not aboue an hū
                     dred menne, emongeſt whom the chief was Wyllyam Brādone whiche bare Henryes bāner. This battaill was fought in the .xxii. day of the moneth of Auguſte, inthe yere of oure Lorde a thouſand cccc .lxxxvi. ye conflict indured more then .ii. howres Richard might (as the fame went) aſaued hymſelf if he would afled awaie, for thoſe that were about hym when thei ſawe his menne from the begynnyng fight but faintly and that ſome were ronne awaie vnto the other parte, ſuſpected treaſon and willed hym to flie and when the mater was manifeſt that all hope of victory was paſt, thei brought hym a ſwi
                        •
                     te horſe. He puttyng a ſied all hope and truſt that was in fleiyng, made (as it was ſaied) this aunſwere that this daie he would haue ether an ende of battaill orels of his life, ſuche was his greate audacite and manfulnes whiche becauſe he did ſe certainly that in this daie he ſhould ob

And ſo the wretehe dyed hauyng the ende that all ſuche were wont to haue whiche in the ſtede of lawe, honeſtie, and all godlynes folowe their owne appetite vyllanye and all wyckednes. And plainly this is an example whiche cannot be expreſſed, to feare theim whiche

will not ſuffer one howre to bee otherwyſe ſpēt then in cruelte miſchief and all deuilliſhe faſſhiōs Henry when he had thus obtained the victorye he fell downe on his knees and with many praiers &amp; thankes, referred all to the goodnes of God. Thē after he ſtode vp beyng wounderfully repleniſhed with ioye, &amp; went vp vpō alitle hill and there gaue two greate comendacions to his ſouldyours commaundyng theim that were hurte to be heled and the dede to bee buryed, afterward he gaue immortall thankes to his noble capitains promiſyng theim that he would neuer forgette their benifite The multitude in ye meane tyme with one voyce &amp; one mynd proclaimed hym kyng. Whē Thomas Stanley ſawe ye, he toke kyng Richardes croune whiche was founde emongeſt the ſpoyle, and by &amp; by putte it vpon his head as though he had been then created kyng by the eleccion of the people as it was wonte to bee in the olde tyme, and this was the firſt token of his felicite. After this, kyng Hēry with his compaignie and carriage went to Leceſtre toward night to bed, whether after he had refreſſhed his compaignie well for the ſpace of twoo daies, that thei might the better goo toward London: Kyng Richardes bodye was brought naked ouer a horſe backe, the hed and the armes hāgyng on the one ſide and the legges on ye other, &amp; caried in to the grey freres of Leceſter, and ſurely it was but a myſerable ſight to loke vpō, yet it was good inough cōſideryng his wretched leuyng, and there without any ſolempnite was buryed twoo dayes after. He raygned twoo yeres twoo monethes &amp; one daie, he was but of a ſmall ſtature hauyng

but a deformed bodie, ye one ſhoulder was higher then the other, he had a ſhorte face &amp; a cruell looke whiche did betoken malice, guyle and deceite. And while he did muſe vpō any thing ſtāding, he would byte his vnder lippe continually, whereby a māne might perceiue his cruell nature within his wreched bodie ſtriued and chaffed alwaie with in hym ſelf, alſo the dagger whiche he bare aboute hym, he would alwaies bee choppyng of it in and out he had a ſharpe and pregnaunt witt, ſubtill and to deſſimule and fayne verie mete. He had alſo a proude and cruell mynde, whiche neuer went from him to the houre of his death, whiche he had rather ſuffer by ye cruell ſworde, though all his compaignie did forſake hym then by ſhamefull flight he would fauoure his life, whiche after might fortune by ſickenes or other condynge ponyſhemēt ſhortely to periſhe.

                        HENRY THE SEVENTH OF that name kyng of England.
                  Firſt after yt he had obteined his kyngdome and heritage by force of armes, entended to ſtabliſhe all thynges &amp; extynguiſh ſediciō, and before he departed from Leyceſter, cauſed ſer Robert Willoughby knight to bryng ye yoūg erle of Warwike ye duke of Clarēces ſoōne before his preſence (whom kyng Richard to that tyme had kept at Sheryhuttō in Yorke ſhire) fearyng muche, leaſt that by this young erle ſome occaſiō might bee taken of renuyng battaill, whiche entended nothyng more then to liue in peace and quietnes. And ſo this erle was brought to hym, &amp; at his commaundement conueighed to London, and there caſt in holde,
                  In the ſelf ſame place alſo of Yorke ſhire, was Ladie Elizabeth eldeſt doughter to the fornamed kyng Edwarde, whom kyng Rychard her vncle would haue maried ſore againſt the mynde and conſent of ye ſame ladie. In ſo muche alſo that the people were ſore againſt it, and accompted it not onely as a reproche &amp; infamie to the kyng hymſelf, but alſo to his counſaill ye did agre to his naughtie purpoſe. Albeit, God of his infinite mercy preſerued the ladie, whiche ſhorte tyme after was brought to London to her mother.

In this time the kyng drawing nighe to London, was there accepted of his citezens ſtreyghte after his cōming moſte roially, &amp; of all parties ſaluted after the moſte louing faſſion ye they could deuyſe geuing thankes to God with ſolempne proceſſion for yt he had ſent theim a king to gouerne ye realme which before was ruled by a cruel &amp; hateful Tirāt

And at this Parliament holden &amp; kept at Weſtmīſter he was created kyng the day of October, in the yere of oure Lorde a. M. foure C .lxxxvi.

Neuertheleſſe, conſidering the chaunce he had before, and the falſhode ye is in many menne from their youth, made yomen of the garde for his bodye, the whiche he firſte of all Englyſhe Kynges cauſed to bee, and as it is thought he did take it of the Frenche kyng. Alſo The garde fyrſte ordeined by kīge Henry the vii. after this he cauſed a parliament to bee had, wher in was made and decreed certayne lawes, actes &amp; ſtatutes for the wealthe of his realme.
                  In this yere a newe ſickeneſſe did reigne, and is ſo ſore and painfull, as neuer was ſuffered before, the whiche was called the burning ſweate. The ſweating ſickeneſſe. And this was ſo intollerable, that men coulde not kepe their beddes, but as lunatike perſons &amp; oute of their wittes ranne about naked, ſo that none almoſte eſcaped ye wer infected therwith. At ye length after the great death of many a thouſande menne they learned a preſente remedye for the ſame dyſeaſe, that is, yf he were ſycke of that ſweate in the daye, that he ſhould ſtreyghtelye downe with his clothes and veſtures, yf in the nighte, yt he ſhould not riſe for the ſpace of .xxiiii. houres, and eate no meate at all, yf he coulde forbeare, and drinke as litle as he mighte.
                  This diſeaſe reigned throughout all England wherof alſo enſued a plague, as a token, and as ye people iudged, a plaine argument that kyng Henrye ſhoulde neuer bee oute of feare and dreade of ſome miſchaunce, ſeing that he was in ſuche great vexacyon at the ſedicyous tumulte that was ryſen al the claimynge of the crowne.
                  
                     
Whē all thynges wer apeaced in London, and ordered after his owne mynd, he rode Northward in progreſſe to pacifie all his realme, and eſpecially thoſe partes where the firſte commocion was, and where alſo wer priuie and cloked frendes of his aduerſaries. But becauſe it was nigh Eaſter, he tooke his waye to Lincolne, and there tariyng was certified that the Lorde Louell and Humfre Stafforde were gone from the ſanctuary in Colcheſter, but to what place or whether, no mā could tell, whiche meſſage the kyng litle regardyng, wēt foorth as he apointed to Yorke, and when he came The cōmocion made by the lord Louell and the lorde Stafforde. there, it was ſhewed hym that the lorde Louell was at hand with a ſtrong power of menne, and woulde inuade the cytie, alſo that the ſaid lorde Stafforde and his brother wer in Gloceſtre, and there had made an inſurreccion, and ſet menne on euery parte to defende the gates and walles of the citie.
                  At the firſt hearyng of this, the kyng was but litle moued, but after that he was certified by the letters of his frendes that it was true, he was in greate feare, for that he had neyther an armye prepared, nor harnyes for theim, but becauſe the mattier required haſte, leaſt that by long taryeng, his aduerſaries power might bee encreaſed and multiplyed, he commaunded the Duke of Bedforde to mete theim with three thouſande mēne, whiche were harnyſed but barely, for theyr breſte plates were for the moſte parte lether. And he hym ſelfe in yt meane tyme would gather vp an hoſte, where he might in euery place. The duke hauyng his mē nigh to ye tētes of his enemyes, cōſulted wt certain

of his cōpaignie, by what waye he mighte traine theim to peace, withoute bloodde ſhedyng. After the whiche deliberation &amp; aduiſement had, it was decreed that certaine ſhoulde proclaime openly, yt all thei ſhould haue their pardonne, that woulde leaue battaile. The whiche proclamation auayled muche,, for the Lorde Louell, eyther for ſome feare, or myſtruſt that he had in his people,, or feryng hym ſelfe of his owne behalfe, fledde pryuely in a night from his compaignie, to Lankeſhire &amp; ther remained a ſpace with ſyr Thomas Broghton knight. And when hys army had knowledge therof, thei alſo ſubmittyng theim ſelfes all to the Duke, aſked pardonne for their heinous offence. The Lorde Stafforde alſo hearyng this, was in a great agony, and for feare dyd take ſanctuarye at Colname .ii. miles from Abindon. But becauſe that ſanetuary was not a defence for traytours, he was taken from that place and behedded, and his brother was ꝑdoned becauſe he was thought not to haue done it of his owne will, but thorowe the counſaill and perſwaſion of his brother.
                  After this buſineſſe was aſſwaged and Yorke ſhyre ſet in peace and quietnes, the Kyng went to London, and ſhortelye after that to Wyncheſter, where the Quene his wyfe, was deliuered of a Prynce called Arthure, and from Wyncheſter he retourned agayne to London.
                  Sone after it chaunſed that one ſyr Richard Symond preeſt, borne by nature to be a traytour and ſedicious perſonne, and yet well learned, had a chyld called Lambert Symenel to bee hys ſcholar, by whome he inuented this crafte and diſceat

that he woulde make the chyld kyng of England and hym ſelfe archebyſhoppe, or ſome hygh poteſtate in the realme, for he knewe verely, that many menne ſuppoſed kyng Edwardes chyldren to bee fled into ſome ſtraunge place, and that Edwarde the Erle of Warwyke, ſonne to the Duke of Clarence ether was or ſhould bee put to death ſhortly And to the ende he myght ye better bryng hys purpoſe about, he taught the chyld bothe learnyng &amp; good maners, and alſo to order hym ſelfe, as one linially deſcendyng from a hygh progenie. Sone after the rumoure was, that the younge Earle of Warwyke was dead in pryſonne. And when the preeſt heard of this, he intendyng therby to bring his matters aboute, chaunged the chyldes name and called hym Edwarde, after the younge Earle of Warwyke, the whiche were boothe of one age, and then ſayled into Irelande, there opening his mynde to certain of the nobilitee, whome he knew to beare but lytle fauoure to Kyng Henry, where he was promyſed ayde of the Lorde Gerardine chauncellour of all that countree, and all that he coulde dooe. Whyche Lorde, fyrſt callyng all hys frendes and louers together, deſyred their helpe in reſtoryng the yong Earle to his herytage. And dyd ſende certain into Englande to deſire theym that were kynge Rychardes frendes to continue in their loue and faythfulnes towardes hym, and helpe hys nephiewes chylde to his ryghte.
                  And that hys power myghte bee the ſtronger to ouercome hys enemyes, he deſyred Lady Margarete ſyſter to kynge Edwarde, and wyfe to the Duke of Burgondy, to further hys purpoſe with

her helpe, whyche lady beyng then in Flaunders, promiſed him by the meſſaungers, that ſhe would not onely maintaine his entente with large mony and ſubſtaunce, but with all the laboure and peynes that ſhe myght occaſion other, to be of ye ſame conſpiracie.
                  When kynge Henrye was certified of thys, he was ſore greued, that by the meanes of ſuche a myſcreaunte perſonne, ſo great ſedicion ſhould bee, neuertheleſſe, the kynge conſideringe that it ſhoulde bee to the deſtruccion of manye menne, yf that he ſhoulde fyghte with his enemies in open feelde, called hys counſayle together at the Charter houſe beſyde Rychemounde, and there conſulted to pacifie thys matter wythoute anye more dyſturbaunce. Where fyrſte it was decreed, that all thei ſhoulde bee pardoned for their offences and treaſons latelye commytted, whiche hath frome that tyme, borne theim ſelfes vpryght towardes their kinge, leaſte that ſyr Thomas Broghton whyche kepte the Lord Louell from the king a great tyme, wyth other deſpeyring of theyr pardon ſhoulde haue made ſome ſodaine inſurrection agaynſt hym. Further more, that men ſhoulde not thyncke, but that the Duke of Clarence was in Englande, it was appoynted that he ſhoulde ſhowe hym ſelfe abrode, wherby the opynion that he was in Ireland myghte bee fruſtrate, and accompted as a lye. Alſo it was further determyned that the Ladye Elyſabeth wyfe to kyng Edward the .iiii. ſhoulde loſe al her landes, becauſe ſhe had ſubmitted her ſelfe and her doughters wholye to the handes of kynge Rychard, contrary to the promyſe

made to the Lordes and nobles, whyche at her deſyre lefte al that they had in Englande and fledde to kynge Henrye in Brytayne, and there dyd ſweare hym to marye her eldeſte daughter, as ſhe wylled theim to dooe.
                  But her purpoſe did not frame as (God would) Thys quene buylded a Collage in Cambrydge, and gaue landes to the maynteyning of the ſame whiche at thys houre is called ye quenes Collage.
                  When thys order and determynacion of the kynge was ended, he wente to London, and the nexte Sondaye folowynge he cauſed the young Earle to bee broughte out of the Tower through the ſtreetes to Poules. And there to ſhewe hym ſelfe to euerye bodye, and taſke with the chiefe and noble menne that were thoughte to haue conſpyred agaynſte kynge Henrye, for thys cauſe that they myghte perceaue the Iryſhe menne to moue battayle vnaduyſedly, and cauſe ſtryfe vppon no iuſte occaſion, howebeit, all thys nothyng auayled, for the Earle of Lyncolne, the Duke of Suffolkes ſoonne, and nephewe to kynge Edwarde, coulde not ſuffer kynge Henrye thus to reygne, but as a traytoure ſayled into Flaūders to the Ladye Margarete, takynge wyth hym Syr Thomas Broghton, with certayne other, Where alſo, the Lorde Louell landed twoo or three dayes before.
                  And there they beynge all together, determyned that the Earle of Lyncolne and the Lorde Louell ſhoulde goo to Irelande, and there attend vpon the counterfeyte Earle, and brynge hym to Englande with all the power they myghte agaynſte

kynge Henrye.
                  So that yf their dooynges had good ſucceſſe that then the foreſayde Lambarte (miſnamed the Earle) ſhoulde by the conſente of the counſayle be depoſed, and the true Earle to bee delyuered oute of pryſon and enherite his right, and iuſte tytle of his dominion. But the kyng, not miſtruſting any man to bee ſo foolyſh hardy as to fyght in ſuch a cauſe, or anye ſo vndyſcrete (eſpeciallye of hys realme) as to beleue it, dyd onelye mynde the ſuppreſſynge of the Iryſhe menne, and theyr enterpryſe to ſubdue. Yet hearynge that the Earle of Lyncolne with other were fledde, and gooen to hys aduerſaries, he cauſed the borders to bee dilygentlye kepte that none other myghte eſcape or geue theym ſocoure, and commynge to the abbaye of Sayncte Edmundes Burye, it was certified that the Lorde Thomas Marques was come to excuſe and pourge hym ſelfe before hym, for certayne thynges that he was ſuſpected, to whome the kynge dyd ſende the Earle of Oxford to take him commynge, and conueyghe hym to the Towre of London, for thys cauſe, that yf he were his frende, as he was in dede, that he ſhould not bee myſcontented to ſuffer a lytle impryſonmente for the ſafetie of hys kynge, yf he were not hys frende, there to tarye that he myghte haue no damage or hurte by hym.
                  And ſo the kynge wente forthe to Norwyche and tariynge there Chriſtemas daye, went after to Walſingham, and from thence to Cambridge and ſo ſtreyght to London. In this tyme the erle of Lincolne, &amp; the lord Louell had got about two

thouſande Germaynes, wyth Martyn Swarte to be theyr captayne, and ſo ſaylynge to Ireland came and made the fornamed Lambarte kyng of Englande at Deuelynge. And ſo wyth the greate multitude of Iryſhe menne aſwell naked and vnarmed perſonnes, as other that the Lorde Gerardyne had vnder hym, they ſayled into Englande, and landed for a purpoſe wythin a lytle of Lancaſtre, truſtynge there to bee ayded of Syr Thomas Broghton the chiefe authoure of thys conſpiracie.
                  The kynge not ſlepynge hys mattiers, but myſtruſtynge that ſuch thynges ſhoulde chaunce ſente certayne Knyghtes, throughe all the Eaſte parties to attende the commynge of hys enemyes, and gatherynge all hys hooſte together, went hym ſelfe to Couentree, where he beynge, it was certified hym that the Earle of Lyncolne was landed at Lancaſtre wyth the newe kynge. Whome the kynge appoynted to meete after the conſente and agremente of hys counſayle, and to goo vppon theym wythoute anye farther delaye leaſt that theyr power by long ſufferaunce ſhould bee augmented and multiplyed.
                  And ſo after ſuche aduiſemente taken, he went to Notingham, and there by a lytle woodde called Boures he pytched hys tentes. To whome ſhortelye after came the Lorde Talbote Earle of Shroweſburye, the Lorde Straunge, the Lorde Cheiney wyth a greate armye of menne, and manye other noble menne, whoſe names here after enſue.

                  The erle of Lyncolne in the meane ſeaſon went forth ſoftely with his compaignie into Yorkeſhire without hurte or diſcommoditie of any māne that dwelt therabout, truſtyng partely therby, &amp; ꝑtely alſo bycauſe he was well knowen and acquainted emong theim, that he ſhould get greate ayde and ſocour there. But when he perceiued very few or none to folowe hym, and that he could not (ſeyng his enemies were ſo nigh hand and he alſo ſo far entred) in ſafegard with his hoſte returne bacward yet he thought it beſt to abyde &amp; taſte the chaunce of battaill, and ſo muche yt rather, becauſe he ſawe Henry within twoo yeres before accompaign
                        •
                     ed but with a fewe and ſmall ſorte of ſouldiers ouercome kyng Richard whiche brought with hym a greate hoſte of well armed menne. Wherfore he, beeyng now in a greate hope of victory, toke his iorney thens towarde Newarke, there to ſette his ſouldyours in araye and mete the kyng, whom he knew well though not to bee paſte .ii. dayes iorney from hym. But before he could come thither, kyng Hēry whiche was ſurely certified of all thynges yt he did or wēt about, came to Newarke alitle before the euen that thei ſhould fight on yt morowe other wyſe then the erle loked for, and there tariyng not long, went forth three myles ferther and ſette his tentes and taryed all night. Of whoſe commyng although therle knewe, yet he went foorth luſtely of his tourney and came that night to a village nigh to his enemies, which is called Stooke, and there pitched his tentes.
                  
                     
The next daie, the kyng ſo ſone as he had ſette his ſouldyours in due ordre and araye, went forwarde wt all ſpede to the place where the erle with all his laye. To the whiche place, when he was come, &amp; had appointed the felde, which was moſte mete for the battaill to bee fought in, by &amp; by gaue place for his enemies to come foorth and prouoked theim to battaill. But as ready as he was to prouoke, ſo readie wer thei of their owne courage to come foorth: ſo that of bothe parties thei ranne to battaill and fought moſte egerly, in whiche tō
                     flicte it did euidently appere that the Germaines whiche were ſette in the forewarde, whoſe capitain was Martine Swarte, were nothyng woorſe in manlyneſſe and cheualry (which thei gotte chiefly by daily and long exerciſe) then the Engliſhemen. And the Ireſhmen although thei fought verie luſtely, yet by the reaſon that thei ware not harnes (accordyng to their faſſhiō and cuſtome) were diſcomfcited and beate downe bothe more in nōbre, and ſoner then all the other. Yet was this battaill ſo earneſtlie, &amp; boldly fought for a whyle of bothe parties, that it could not bee wel diſcerned to whiche ſyde the victorie would incline. But at the laſt, the kynges forewarde which there abode all ieoperdie, ſo luſtely &amp; couragiouſly ranne vpon their enemies, yt they were none hable to reſiſt or abyde their power: ſo yt all aſwell Germaines as Iriſh men were there ſlain orels made to flie, of ye whiche none at all could eſcape awaie. Whiche battaill, whē it was thus dooen, all mēne might ſe of what boldnes &amp; audacitie theſe rebelliōs were. For their capitaines Ihon erle of Lincolne, Frācis Louell

Thomas Broghtō, Martine Swart, &amp; Thomas Gerardine neuer gaue backe one foote but were ſlaine all in the ſame place where thei began firſt to fight. There were kylled at that vattaill with their fiue capitaines ſpoken of euen now of that partie about foure thouſand. Of the kynges part there were not halfe of theim whiche fought in ye forewarde ſlain.
                  Thē was Lambert, the child whiche was falſly reported to bee the Dukes ſoonne of Clarēce, and his maiſter ſir Richard Simond preeſt, both taken, but neither of theim putte to death, becauſe Lambert was yet but a child and did ſeme to dooe that, more by compulſion of his maiſter thē of his owne will, and the other was a preeſt whiche for his defaulte was caſt into perpetuall priſone. But this Lambert was taken into the Kynges kechin and after was made one of the kynges faukeners and is yet a lyue. And thus was all yt Margarete went about at this tyme, turned to naught and to none effecte, whiche thyng whē ſhe heard tell of in Flaūders, ſhe was verie lory at the hearte &amp; made greate mone. And yet could ſhe not bee contēt, but immediately after, inuēted an other thyng to vexe and trouble kyng Henry, as it ſhalbe ſhewed here after.
                  Kyng Henry when he had all thynges brought thus to paſſe, and vtterly vanquiſſhed theſe his enemies, thought hymſelf at one tyme deliuered from twoo eiuils together, that is to ſaie, from bothe feare that was preſent, and alſo that was to come. For it was not to bee thought yt thei whiche were ſo fewe in nombre durſte bee ſo bold to entre

into the realme and make battaile againſt ye kyng whom they knewe wel ynough would bryng with hym a great and well armed hooſte, but that they had other felowes of the ſame coniuracion whiche would mete and ayde theim all that they could in tyme and place conuenient. Therefore when the kyng ſawe the hoſte of his enemies manifeſtly before his eyes, he commaunded that no mā ſhoulde kyll the earle of Lincolne, but that he ſhould bee brought to hym alyue, to the entent that he might ſhewe and bewraye all the other whiche were of ye conſpiracie. But that the ſowdyers would not do, leaſt the ſauyng of hym, ſhould bee the deſtrucciō (as it ſhould haue been in dede) of many other. This battayle was fought in the yeare of oure Lorde a thouſande foure hundreth, foure ſcore, &amp; the ſecōde yere of this Hēryes reigne. In ye whiche yere alſo Thomas Burſcher archebyſhop of Cā
                     terburye died, into whoſe roume ſucceded Iohn Morton late biſhop of Ely, whome Alexander of that name the ſixte biſhop of Rome made Cardinall. Now to retourne to my purpoſe.
                  After this, the kyng, when he had gathered al the prayes and ſpoyles together, and had buryed theim that there wer ſlain, went forth to Lincolne and there taryed three dayes, and had euerye daie one proceſſion to thanke God almightie that he had the ouerhande of his enemies. And incontynently ſent his banner to Walſyngham to be conſecrate to our Lady, there to bee kepte for a perpetuall mo
                        •
                     ument of victorie. Then did he execuciō of ſuche rebellions as were there taken, &amp; ſhortely after tooke his iorneye foorth to Yorke, and there

likewyſe ſuche as were founde gyltye dyd he punyſhe ſtrayghtlye. When all this was dooen, he wente vnto Newcaſtle, and frome thence ſente into Scotlande Richarde Foxe whiche not longe before was made biſhop of Exeter, and Richarde Edgecombe knight as Ambaſſadoures to kynge Iames for a league of peace. For this Henrye thought it a great pleaſure and cōmoditee, to bee in peace and concorde with kinges &amp; gouernours whiche laye aboute this his realme, and ſpecially and before all other with kyng Iames, becauſe yt there no rebellions might truſt (whiche otherwiſe perchaunce woulde haue truſted) to haue ayde or ſuccoure at his hande: ſo that thereby there durſte none againe take weapon againſt hym. The ambaſſadoures, when they wer come into Scotland to the kyng, were of hym both gently and after the moſte louing faſhion receiued and heard, and then dyd he plainlye declare and open to theim yt he hym ſelfe loued kyng Henrye and his, no man 
                        〈◊〉
                     : but that yt moſte parte of his Scottes and ſubiectes could in no caſe agree with the Engliſh menne. Wherfore, excepte that he ſhould offend or 
                        〈…〉
                     ſe theim, he deſired ye legates to bee contēt with truce for .vii. yeres in promeſſe, but in dede, he ſayed, that peace betwene theim on his parte ſhoulde neuer bee broken, and or euer thoſe ſeuen yeres ſhould bee paſſed, that he would geue truce for ſeuen yeres lenger: ſo that kyng Henry and he would euer bee in peace and moſte aſſured amytie And this did kyng Iames, becauſe he knewe that no facte of his people, ſhoulde bee alowed. When the Ambaſſadoures hearde this, they tooke the

yeres that were offered theim, as concernynge peace, and by and by retourned home to kyng Hē
                     ry againe, and ſhewed hym all the mattier in ordre. With the whiche tydynges he was veraye well contented.
                  Shortely after, the kyng departed thence towarde London, and in the waye at Leicetre mette hym Abaſſadoures from the Frenche kyng which ſhewed hym, that their kyng Charles had recouered many tounes and cyties, whiche before were poſſeſſed of kyng Maximilian, and that he kepte battayle nowe with Fraunces the duke of Brytayne, becauſe he kepte and ſocoured in his dominion certaine that were traytours and rebellions againſt hym, of the whiche the chief was Lewes duke of Orlyance, and therfore he deſyred hym of his frendſhip &amp; familiaritie, that either he would helpe hym orelles medle of neyther partie. But kynge Henrye, althoughe he had founde muche frendſhip at the Frenche kynges hande, yet for as muche as he ſpyed whereof this ſtryfe beganne, with this meſſage was not well contente. For the cauſe that the Frenchemenne tooke battayle, was becauſe they ſawe that the Duke was an olde manne and had neuer a chylde, and thereby that they myghte brynge that Dukedome into their ſubieccion.
                  When kyng Henrye perceiued this, and alſo howe louyng the Brytaynes had been euer to Englande, and finally remembred the tendre loue which was betwene the duke and hym, thought it beſt, if nede wer, to helpe the Britaynes, Yet for as

muche as he had founde the Frenche kyng veray kynde in tymes paſt, and had partely by his helpe recouered his kyngdome, he was veraye lothe to medle: in ſo muche that he coulde not well tell what was beſt in this mattier to bee dooen. But at the laſte he fully purpoſed, if neceſſitie ſhoulde require, to helpe the duke in all that he might. Yet, leaſt he ſhould make of his highe frende hys extreme enemie, his aunſwere was to the ambaſſadoures, that he did intende to make their kyng and the duke frendes again. Wherfore aſſone as the Frenche kynges ambaſſadoures were dimiſſed, he ſent on meſſage Chriſtopher Vrſwycke to Charles the kynge of Fraunce. Firſte to certifye hym, that he was veraye glad of the victorye that he had vpon Maximilian, ſecondarely what tumulte and inſurreccion was made here in Englād thyrdly and eſpecially to deſyre hym to bee at one againe with the Duke of Brytayne. And then he commaunded this Vrſwycke, that if the kyng of Fraunce ſhoulde bee ſo contente, to go foorthe immediatlye to the Duke, and deſyre hym lykewyſe of the ſame.
                  But when the kyng was come againe to London, there was ioye and myrthe for the victorye ye he had on euery ſyde. For not onely the kyng, but alſo euerye one of his cytezyns reioyſed veraye muche. Wherfore the kyng ſhewed hym ſelfe both beraye humane and courteous toward all menne, and alſo rewarded all theim that tooke paynes in that battaile moſte bountefully. And not long after delyuered Lord Thomas Marques out of the 
                        •
                     oure, and loued hym veraye well.
                  
                     
In the meane ſeaſon Chriſtofer Vrſwicke was come to the frenche kyng, &amp; of hym, after the moſt louing faſſion yt coulde bee, receiued. And as ſone as he had ſhewed his meſſage, ye kyng ſhewed him ſelfe to bee there wt veray well pleaſed. Then went ye ambaſſadour ſtreight thence, as it was cōmaunded hym, into Britain, and ſhewed the duke what kyng Henry would haue dooen. But the duke (becauſe hym ſelf had been ſicke a great while, &amp; therby his memory &amp; wit was d
                        ••
                     aied) called to hym to heare the meſſage bothe Lewes the duke of Orleaunce and other of his councell, whiche Lewes in no wyſe woulde haue any peace to bee made, but ſaied that it was more mete that kyng Henrye (ſeing he had founde ſuche kyndneſſe at the Dukes hande, and Britaine was ſuche a good defence to England) to helpe to kepe battayle all yt he might againſt the frenchmen. Then retourned this Chriſtofer againe into Fraunce, &amp; declared to the king Charles what aunſwer was made of ye Britains, and ſhortely after came into Englande againe. But ſtill in the meane time, ye Frenche kyng went aboute buſely to ouercome the Brytains, and the more he was nigh of his purpoſe, ſo much ye more did he exhorte &amp; deſire kyng Henry to make peace betwene theim, wherfore he ſēt Bernarde Daubeney knighte in all the haſte to kyng Henrye to deſire hym in any wiſe to make ſome ende of this cō
                     trauerſy. And therupon the kyng being deſirous of the ſame, choſe thre oratours, ye Abbot of Abindon, Iohn Lilie the biſhop of Romes collectoure and Richard Tonſhal a knight and a veray wiſe man, to gooe firſte to the Frenche kyng, and then

to the duke to make amitee and frendſhyp againe betwene theim. But or euer theſe ambaſſadoures proceded on their iourney, Iohn Lilye fell ſicke of the goute: therfore for hym was choſen Chriſtofer Vrſwycke, and they together wente (as they were cōmaunded) Firſte into Fraunce to the kyng, and thence withoute delaye into Britain. But Fraunces the duke in no caſe would take ſuche condicyons as wer there offered, wherfore they came back againe into Fraunce without their purpoſe, and there tarieng, ſignified to kyng Henry by their letters all that was dooen. But or their letters came to the kynges handes, Edward Woodilile, a bold Champion came to hym &amp; deſired veraye earneſtly that he myght haue an hoſt of men to helpe the Britains, and leaſire it ſhould cauſe any diſſencion betwene the Frenche kyng and hym, he ſaied that he would gooe priuely and without a paſporte, to thentent it might bee thought that he ſtole out of the land. But the kyng, for as much as he truſted that peace ſhoulde bee made, woulde in no wyſe graunt his peticion. Wherfore this Edward wēt ſtreight into the yſle Veches, which was in his dominacion, &amp; there ſo ſone as he had gathered his menne together about foure. C, ſayled ouer to the Britaines, &amp; ioyned hym ſelfe with theim againſt the Frenchmē, whiche thing when it was knowen in Fraunce, made ye ambaſſadours greatly afraid of their liues. But whiles they were in this feare, and the Frēchemen thought it dooen maliciouſly of Kyng Henry, there came other Ambaſſadours frome hym to the Frenche kyng, certifieng hym &amp; declaring (by moſt euident tokēs) that it was nothing

in dede as it was thought to haue been. To the which meſſage, albeit ye kyng had lytle credēce yet he made as thoughe he had not bene angry at all. So ye Ambaſſadours renewed peace betwene their king &amp; hym for .xii. monethes and retourned home again, &amp; ſhewed the kyng all ſuch thinges yt they had either hearde or ſene there, wherof he gathered that ye Frenchmen did nothing leſſe entend then to haue peace made. Wherfore without delay he called a parliament &amp; there conſulted of the aidyng of the Brytains: then of the exſpence that ſhould bee therin made, &amp; after of other mattiers.
                  And aſſone as the parliament was broken vp, he cauſed muſters to bee taken in euery toune thorowoute his realme. Yet leaſte peraduenture he might ſeme willingly to breake the amitee whiche was betwene the Frenche kyng and hym, he ſent Ambaſſadours into Fraunce to certifye the kyng that of late he had kepte a parliament, and there yt it pleaſed all the nobles that he ſhould ſende helpe to ye Britains, becauſe they at all times had dooen more benefites to Englande then all other naciōs and therfore that he ſhould either leaue of battail orelles that he ſhoulde not bee greued if he dyd obey ye mindes of his Lordes and prelates, and yet that he woulde promiſe hym this one thing, yt his ſhould medle wt hym no lēger then he was in Britain &amp; kepte battaile vpon theim. With theſe commaundementes ye ambaſſadours went foorth and declared to ye French kyng all the minde and wyll of their kyng which thyng he litle cared for, and thought as it came to paſſe in dede, that the Engliſhemen there coulde lytle auayle.
                  
                     
In the meane ſeaſon the Britains fought one felde at a place called ſainte Albanes &amp; there ſped beray euel. For of theim Lewes duke of Orleaūce with many mo were taken, and Edwarde Wooduile, Iames Galeot an Italian and a veray good warryer, with diuers other noble menne ſlaine. Whiche thing when kyng Henry heard tell of, he thinking it tyme to make haſte, ſente ſpedely Roberte Brooke Lorde, Iohn Cheinye, Iohn Midelton, Raufe of Helton, Richarde Corbet, Thomas Leightō, Richard Lacon, &amp; Edmond Cornewell, all luſtye capitaines with .viii. thouſand wel armed men to ye Brytains to helpe theim in theyr nede, whiche by reaſon ye wind ſerued theim, came thither ſo ſone as they could deſire. But when the Frenche menne knewe of their comming (whome they knewe ſo longe as they were freſhe and luſty to bee in a maner inuincible) at ye firſte wer blanke all, and durſte ſcarſely looke oute of their tentes, but afterwarde truſting yt they might wery theim they went many of theim together into diuers places, and kepte many bikeringes with the Engliſh menne, but they theim ſelfes euer bare the worſte away, howſoeuer the Engliſhmen ſped, they ſped naught. Whiles they this kynde of warre did exerciſe, the Duke Fraunces died, and then was all daſſhed. For the chyefe rulers of the Brytains being ſome of theim corrupted with money, &amp; ſome ſturred vp with ambicyon, fell into deuiſyon amonge theim ſelues, and ſemed nomore to endeuoure to defende their commune weale, but rather to deſtroy and vtterly extinguiſhe it Which thing the engliſhe menne perceiuing, and alſo ſuffering

muche colde, were compelled of neceſſitee within fyue moonethes that their wente thyther, to come backe agayne into Englande.
                  Then Charles the French kyng maried Anne the Dukes doughter, and gat al Britayn by that meanes into hys hādes. But of this it ſhalbe ſpoken more here after.
                  It was decreed here in Englande before there were any ſouldyours ſent into Brytayne, that for the expence of that warre, euery man ſhould paye as thei were hable, a tribute, whyche the mooſte parte of theim that dwelte in the byſhopryke of Durhā and Yorke ſhyre, dyd vtterly refuſe to pay, and complayned of the matter to their Lorde the Earle of Northumberland. And he immediately ſignified to the kyng by his letters that the people dyd greatly lament and was ſory ſaiyng, that thei were neuer put to ſo muche coaſt, as thei had been of late dayes, &amp; nowe that ther was ſo much requyred of theim, that neither thei were hable to pay ſo great a ſumme, nor would pay it. Yet for al that the kyng cōmaunded the Erle to get it on thē and make theim pay it whether thei would or not leaſt peraduenture it myght be a cauſe, that yf at any time a tribute agayne ſhould bee required of thē, to make an inſurreccion. Which thyng when the people hearde of, by and by they ranne vnto the earle and as the authoure of the tribute paiyng Themurde ryng of the erle of Northūberland kylled hym out of hande. And when thei had ſo done, thei chaſe Ihon Egremonknight a verey dicious perſonne to bee their captayne, and ſo arraied them ſelfes, and went agaynſt the kyng, makyng cries in euery towne, that thei came to fight

for no nother cauſe but to defēde yt cōmon libertie.
                  But when the mattier ſhoulde come to blowes thei waxed colde all the ſorte of theim, and euerye one wiſhed that this tumulte wer retracted which was nowe alredy begonne, ſo that at the cōcluſiō not one ſcacely ſcaped without his great diſcommodite. For the kynge aſſone as he hearde of this inſurreccion, went downe with an hooſt to Yorke wherof theſe ſlaues and traitours beyng greatly afraied, fledde ſome hether and ſome thether and durſt not abide and ſuſtaine the power of ye kynges army. Wherfore thei wer ſone taken and puniſhed greuouſely, accordyng to their deſeruyng euery one of theim. But Ihon Egremont whiche was their captain fledde into Flanders to Margarete of whome we ſpake before.
                  And the kyng ſo ſone as this buſines was quē
                     ched, tooke his iourny back again vnto London and committed the tribute whiche was in Yorke and about Yorke to bee taken vp, holy to Richard Touſtal. And this was ye yere of our lord a thouſand foure hundred .xc. and the fourth yere of the reigne of this kyng Henry.
                  And in thys yere alſo the kynge of Scottes 
                        
                           〈…〉
                        . was ſore vexed. For his ſubiectes roaſe agaynſt hym and made his ſonne Iames whiche was as yet but a chylde, their capitain. Wherfore, he ſent to the kynge of Englande, to the Frenche kyng, and to the byſhoppe of Roome Innocentius to deſire theim to make ſome end of thys ciuile battayle and contencion whiche was betwene hys people and hym. Whiche afterwarde ſente theyr ambaſſadours as they were deſired, but all in

vayne. For ye rude ſort would nedes fight onleſſe The kyng of Scottes ſlain of his ſubiectes. he would reſygne his crowne, wherfore ſhortely after, thei fought, and in that battayle kylled the kyng and gaue his ſonne Iames whiche was the fourth of that name the crowne.
                  But the byſhoppe of Romes legate Hadrian came to late. For whyles he was in Englande wt kyng Henry, worde came that the kyng of Scottes was ſlayne in battayle and hys ſoonne made kyng. And therfore, he taried here in England for a ſpace, and was veray muche made of, and hyghly commended to the kyng by Ihon Mortō archbyſhop of Canterburie. Whereby he came into ſo high fauour with kyng Henry, that he made him biſhoppe of Herforde, and ſhortly after, that leaſt gaue hym the biſhopprike boothe of Welles and Bathe. And not longe after he retourned wt theſe honours to Roome, and there of Alexander was made Cardinall.
                  There beganne alſo of freſhe, certayne buſineſſe as concernynge Brytaine before this geare was appeaſed: whiche was, that Maximilian beyng at that tyme without a wyfe, would haue maried the duke of Briteines doughter, and had one that wowed for hym, which lady promiſyng hym fayth &amp; trueth, to the entent that ſhe might not go from her word, he vſed this way wt her, when ſhe went to her bed the night after, as to the bedde of wedlocke, the wower that was hired, putte one of his fete into ye bed to the knee in ye ſight &amp; cōpany of many noble matrōs &amp; ladies, for a token &amp; teſtimony yt the mariage was conſūmate, &amp; thei .ii. as mā &amp; wife. But this did nothing auaile, for Char

the Frenche kyng was deſireous to marye her &amp; hearyng that Maximiliā was ſure to her, dyd the more buſely ſet vpon the Britaynes, to thentent he might both haue the ladye and the countree alſo at his wyll, for he eſtemed that mariage to bee of no ſtrength or force. Neuertheleſſe, he feared kyng Henry muche, leaſt that he would ſtoppe his purpoſe, whiche kyng had made a league, and Ferdinande alſo the kyng of Spayne, had made ye ſame with the Britaynes, to aſſiſt theim in all their ieoperdies and perilles that ſhould chaunce to theim by foren countrees, wherfore he ſent in al poſt haſt Franceſe Lucemburgenſe, Charles Marignane and Roberte Gaguine, to kyng Henry for a peace to bee confirmed and hadde, deſyrynge hym, that their kyng might ordre the mariage of the Ladye Anne as wer thought beſt without any let or hynderaunce of it by hym, but kyng Henry would not agree to theim, that the lady ſhould bee maried to hym, conſyderyng ſhe was made ſure to the kyng Maximilian, for that it was againſt all right and lawe bothe of God and manne. Albeit the kynge would gladly make a peace betwene theim bothe, and ſo demiſſyng ye kynges Ambaſſadoures with a large and ample rewarde, ſent Thomas Goldeſtone abbot of Cantorbury and the lord Thomas of Ormondye ambaſſadours ſtreight after theim.
                  In this meane ſpace, Alexander B. of Rome the ſixt of that name after Innocētius ſent the biſhop of Cōcordienſe legate to the Frenche kyng for certayne mattiers, and emong other for a peace and vnitee to bee confederate betwyxt hym and kyng Henry, the whiche when he had eaſely obteyned,

he came to Englande and there beyng entretained moſte roially of the kyng, had his purpoſe and deſire of hym. The Engliſhe ambaſſadours then beyng with the Frenche kyng, purpoſed to haue a peace concluded, whiche firſt demaunded certain thynges of the kyng ere that it ſhould bee made, albeit the kyng would graūt theim nothyng, and was ſore moued with their requeſt &amp; aſkyng. So ye ſhortly after, the Frenche kyng ſent to the noble menne of Britain greate giftes and rewardes to the entent thei might moue the ladie Anne to giue her troweth to hym, and alſo ſent to herſelf many princely giftes &amp; tokens, ye ſhe would beare loue to hym. And yt ſhe might not feare but that ſhe might lawfully marie to hym, certified her ye the promiſe was of none effecte yt ſhe had gyuē to Maximiliā for yt it was geuē &amp; made wtout his cōſent whiche had ye gouernaunce &amp; dominion ouer all ye countre And this was the cauſe that no concorde or peace could bee kept betwixt theim. And where as that the kyng had taken Maximilians doughter ladie Margaret to bee his wife, he ſaied that it might bee lawfully diſſolued becauſe ye ladie was vnder age, and not ripe to bee maried. This ladie Anne of Britain through the perſuaſion of many noble menne of that countree, was contented to bee his wife and ladie. And when the kyng was certified of this, he haſtened the mariage with all the expedicion and celeritee that he could. So that the Engliſhe ambaſſadours returned again to their countree, and nothyng dooen or agreed vpon in their matter. When the kyng was certified of this by his ambaſſadours, he purpoſed to make battaill

againſt hym, and to reuenge the naughtie entent of his, with the ſwerde, and aſſemblyng his counſaill together, ſhowed theim the matter, and the iuſte cauſe he had to fight, deſteryng theim for the maintenaunce of theſame warres to helpe hym with money, neuertheleſſe that menne ſhould not thynke it to bee extorte of theim, he willed euery māne to gyue as muche and as litle as he would, and theim to bee eſtemed and taken as his moſte beſte and aſſured frendes that gaue ye moſt money When this ſomme was gatheryng and preparaunce made for battaill, Maximilian the kyng warred ſore with the Frenchemen, whiche kyng was taken a litle before at a certain brunt and ſkirmiſhe made, and caſt in priſone, after the whiche tyme kyng Henry ſent to hym Giles Dabeney capitain of Calais to aide hym with three thouſād harniſſed mēne. At ye length Maximilian hauyng the better hand of the Frenchemen, entēded to reuenge hymſelf of the Frēche kyng, for that he had repudiate his doughter ladie Margarete, and taken to hym as wife quene Anne, but becauſe he was not fully hable of hymſelf to ſuſtein that battaill, he ſent Iames Conti
                        •
                     alde ambaſſadour to kyng Henry for helpe, whiche Iames when he had dooen his meſſage, the kyng promiſed that he would dooe for hym all that he could in mainteinyng his warres.
                  In this tyme, Charles the Frenche kyng maried ladye Anne, chalengyng by this mariage the dominion and gouernaunce of ye Brytaines. Maximilian the kyng beyng certified of this, was greately moued, for that he did not onely forſake

and repudiate his doughter ladye Magarete, but alſo receiued in mariage ye ladye and quene Anne to his wife, and in this furie he ſent to kyng Hēry deſieryng hym to prepare an armie, for he would goo vpon the Frenche menne, and kepe open battaill with theim, whiche kyng Henry gathered an hoſte of menne, and proclaimed battaill in all his realme, after the whiche proclamacion there came to London an houge armie of menne, with their capitaines, whiche herafter enſewe and folowe.

When they had dooen their meſſage thei returned backe again

to their kyng, certifiyng hym, that Maximiliā was ſo poore and nedye of monye and menne, that he could not be hable to ſuſteyne any battaile neuertheleſſe his mynde and will was good, if his power and habilitee had been correſpondent to it. The kyng after the receipte of theſe letters, was diſpleaſed muche with hym, albeit conſyderyng he had gooen ſo farre in it, and had ſuche furnyture of all thynges prepared, leaſt that menne ſhoulde impute it to hym as cowardneſſe to faynt frō battaile, he proceded forth towarde Fraunce, and about ye .vi. daye of Septēbre he landed at Caliſe, &amp; there reſted his armye. Wher worde was brought to all the hoſte (for thei did not knowe of it before) that Maximilian could make no preparaunce for lacke of mony. At ye whiche thei maruailed greatly, conſideryng that he had ſuche vilanye ſhewed hym not longe before at the kynge of Fraunce hand. Yet thei wer neuer diſcoumfeyted at it, but like ſtoute and valiaunt warryars had great confidence in their owne power and ſtrengthe, wyth whō the kyng of Fraunce (after yt he perceaued it beſt for his profite &amp; eaſe) would gladly haue been reconciled, although he had a ready hoſte to fight againſt theim &amp; withſtāde their power. And eſpecially he deſyred peace for this cauſe, yt he might haue the loue of his neighboures, to the entent his realme might bee in better ſauegarde and quietnes, whē he ſhould warre againſt Ferdinād kyng of Napels, at ye deſyre of Ludouike Sfortia duke of Millayn, whiche at that preſent tyme did inuite hym to it, wherfore he did ſende Philip Deſquerd chief of Annonye to deſyre kyng Henrye of peace,

whiche Philip did ſend ye letters to hym, before he came into the countre hymſelf, wherin he ſignified that he would take ſuche paines in bryngyng his purpoſe about, that he would if it ſhould ſo pleaſe his grace, reconcile bothe hym and their kyng to loue eche other as thei haue dooen heretofore, and ſaied that it ſhould bee for his honour to take theſame condicion, whiche condicion if he would ſend certain of his capitains to mete with hym in any parte of Fraunce, and there to determine of it he ſhould haue it there promiſed &amp; hereafter duely to bee performed. The kyng after he had red theſe letters, did ſend the biſhop of Exceter, and Giles Dabeney to the forenamed Philip for peace to be agreed vpon &amp; concluded, the whiche after a ſpace determyned vpon certain condicions whiche here after ſhalbee ſhewed, that peace ſhould bee had on bothe parties. When thei were thus conſultyng, ye kyng hauyng his hoſte at Caleis, remoued from that place to Bononye, &amp; there pitchyng his tētes beſeeged the toune with all the power he might, whiche toune becauſe it was ſtrongely defended &amp; furniſhed with all thynges neceſſarye for warre, it could not bee ouercome without greate labour, &amp; before yt he either could or did ouercome any parte of it, woord was brought, that a peace was cōcluded and made, whiche heard, as it was pleaſure to the Frenchemen, ſo it was ſorowe to the Engliſhe men, for thei cried out of the kyng and ſaied it was not for his honour ſo to dooe, but the kyng as a wiſe manne &amp; moſte prudent prince, ſaied it ſhould be the death of many noble &amp; puiſaunt capitaines if he ſhould continue theſame battaill, &amp; therefore

it might be to his ſore reproche, if it wer in his power, not to tendre aſ well the health of his cōmons as his owne, whiche ſaiyng did ſomewhat coule &amp; pacifye their grief. And after this dooen, the kyng returned backe to Caliſe, for becauſe it was enformed hym yt one Richard ye named hym ſelf ye ſonne of kyng Edwarde had made an inſurreccion in Flaūders, through ye counſaill of lady Margarete ye quene, to fight againſt hym, which thyng, kyng Henry conſyderyng did the more ſpedely haſten to conclude a peace. And the condicion of this peace to bee made was this, yt the Frenche kyng ſhould paye to kyng Henry, a certain ſumme of meny, the whiche was leauyed by the ambaſſadours, for the coſt and charges that the kyng was put to in that battayll, and alſo ſhould yerely for a certain ſpace paye or cauſe to bee payde to the kyng of Englād for a full recompence. x

After this the kyng went frō Calis to England again, &amp; yet that he might not be wtout ſome trouble or buſynes, quene Margaret of Spaine (whiche euer watched to do hym a diſpleaſure) perceauyng yt the erle with his cōpaignie could not haue ſuche ſucceſſe in their buſineſſe as ſhe would haue wiſhed theim, ſhe inuēted a new way to worke treaſon againſt him. There was a certain yoūg mā of Tornace, very beautiful &amp; faire in coūtenaunce, &amp; of a pregnaunt witte, whiche yoūg mā was called Peter &amp; ſurnamed Warbecke, &amp; for his cowardnes nycknamed of the Engliſhe men &amp; called Perkyn, Perkyn warbeck. which yoūg mā trauaylyng many countrees could ſpeake many lāguages &amp; for his baſenes of ſtocke &amp; birth was knowen of none almoſt. Therfore ye quene thynkyng this yoūg man to bee mete whō ſhe might feigne to be the duke of Yorke, and ſōne to her brother kyng Edward, kept hym a certain tyme wt her priuely, and tellyng hym what he ſhould be, yt he might the rather perſuade mē to be the kynges ſonne did ſend hym into Irelāde, after what time ſhe knewe that kyng Henry had apointed to fight againſt the Frenche kyng, where he was honorably receaued &amp; taken of euery manne as a prynce, for whoſe right, they promyſed all to fight, and helpe hym in all yt they could. After this it came to ye Frēche kynges eare yt ſuch an one was in Ireland, for whō the kyng did ſend to ſee &amp; cauſed hym to be brought before him, &amp; when he came into his p̄ſence, ye kyng accepted hym gladly, &amp; after a princely faſhiō intreteined hym. But after ye he came in loue wt the kyng of England, the ſayd Charles did dimiſſe ye yoūg mā, &amp; would no lōger

kepe hym, leaſt that ſome inconueniencie or cauſe of ſtrife ſhould chaunce thorough it. Wherfore ye young manne went to Flaunders agayne to the quene Magarete, whiche quene did receaue hym with ſuche gladneſſe, that ſhe coulde not well rule her ſelfe, &amp; for this cauſe onely ſhe dyd ſhewe her ſelfe ſo ioyfull and merye, that menne mighte perſwade theim ſelfe that this was Richard the kynges ſoonne, and vpon that cauſe truely, men did ye more reuerence to the younge manne, and yt more firmely beleue hym to bee the righte heire &amp; ſonne to kyng Edwarde. Alſo after this rumour blaſed abrode, aſwel in England, Fraunce, as Flaundres there beganne great ſedicion to ſpryng, and firſte they that were long in ſanctuary for the greate offences that they had commytted, and other that wer caſt in pouertie, gathered a compaignie of mē and ſayled ouer into Flaunders to the counterfaicte Edwarde, otherwiſe named Peter, alſo many of the noble men conſpired together, and to the entent they might bryng their purpoſe wel about, they did ſend certain to the Quene Margarete, to knowe when theſame Edwarde might come conueniently into Englande, ye thei beyng certified of theſame might ye more eaſely receaue &amp; bryng hym into ye realme. So yt by the conſent and agrement of theim all, ſyr Robert Clyfforde knight &amp; Wyllyam Barley wer ſent to ſhewe all their myndes &amp; aduyce as concernyng the newe founde duke, to the Quene Margarete. Whome the Quene did accepte gladlye, and perſuaded theim, that it was true that was publyſhed of Rycharde the duke, and ſtreight vpon ſhewed theim theſame

Peter, whiche was muche lyke Richarde, prayſyng his vertues and qualitees that he had, wonderfullye.
                  The ſaid Robert, whē he had ſeen theſame yoūg manne, beleued ſurely that he was of the kynges bloode, and wrote to Englande to his coumpaignye and felowes of his conſpiracie, that he knewe hym to bee the kynges ſoonne by his face &amp; euery proporcion of his body. And when theſe letters came vnto Englande, the chief capitaynes of this buſineſſe did openly diuulgate and publyſhe, that it was trewe that was ſpoken and ſaied abroad of the Duke, but it was dooen by ſuche a crafte, that no manne coulde tell who was the authoure of that rumoure.
                  When the kyng perceiued that many men did geue credence to his vaine fable, he thought beſte for his owne ſafegard to prouide a remedy for it, &amp; alſo myſtruſting that ſome conſpiracye had bene made bicauſe that ſir Robert Clifford had fled priuely into Flaundres, commaunded certain knightes that were choſen and piked menne of warre wt a bonde of menne to kepe the borders ſurely ye no manne might eſcape or ſayle ouer the ſea without a paſporte or licence geuen by hym. Alſo that men myghte not contynue in the falſe perſwaſion and belefe that they had conceyued of the duke, he cauſed certain ſpies to ſearch in all the citees of Belgike, to knowe of what progenie this myſnamed Richarde was, and to geue theim highe rewardes that would ſhewe the verite and truth of the ſame matter. So that they ſailynge into Fraunce, euerye manne dyd gooe into a contraye quarter,

and enquired diligently for hym, and at ye length, certain of theim came to a towne called Tornace and there were certifyed by the teſtymonye of many honeſt menne that he came but of a lowe and courſe parentage, and he was named Peter War becke, whiche thing alſo the kynges frendes certified hym by their letters and writynges to hym more plaine and euidentelye. Therfore when the kyng had knowen the matter wholy, aſwel by his frendes as by his ſpies ſent foorth purpoſelye for the ſame, he cauſed it to bee proclaimed openly aſwell in other regions &amp; countrees as in England that the diſceate and deueliſh crafte might appere euident to euery manne. And firſte he ſent ambaſſadours to Philyp the chiefe capitaine in Flaundres, and to his councell, becauſe he was but of a younge age, whiche were ſir Edward Poninges knight, and ſir William Varame preeſt and lawyer, that they might ſhewe euidently howe falſely the younge manne hath vſurped the name of Richarde duke of Yorke whiche was kylled with his brother Edward in the Towre of London, at the cōmaundement and will of kyng Richard his vncle, as euery man coulde teſtifye and affirme moſt ſurely.
                  Alſo that he was borne of a poore ſtocke, and an obſcure famulie in Tornace, and there named Perkin Warbecke, and therfore that it woulde pleaſe hym &amp; his councel not to ſuffer theim ſelfes to bee blynded or ſeduced with ſuche mere impoſtures and craftie illuſions, nor yet to aide hym at any hande to cauſe ſedicion or ſtrife, conſideryng that he had no iuſte title to the enheritynge of the

ſame. And that they would the rather bee his frendes nowe, becauſe yt he helped Maximilian theyr kyng the yere before againſte the power and violencye of the Frenche menne, where as he of hym ſelfe was not hable to refyſte theyr myghte and ſtronge power. When the Ambaſſadours had dooen their meſſage, they were gentely entretayned of hym, and had their requeſt, that he woulde not (for the loue that he oughte vnto the kynge) no nor any of his counſaile helpe theſame Perkin any thinge at all.
                  Neuertheleſſe, yf the quene Margaret would perſiſte and continewe in her malice towardes the kyng (whome the Ambaſſadour ſir William Varame had reproued and checked ſore, for bringing vp of ſuche monſters and commune plagues, to the publike weale in his oration that he made vnto Philippe and his counſayle) it was not in their power to withſtande it, for becauſe that ſhe might doo in her owne herytage all thinges at her owne wyll and pleaſure. Whiche quene entended fully to arme this Perkin with a ſtronge compaignye of menne againſt kyng Henry.
                  After that kynge Henrye dyd heare of this, he purpoſed to pacyfye all this buſyneſſe that was like to chaunce, by wytte and policye, and ſtreight dyd ſende foorthe certaine ſpies, whiche ſhoulde fayne theim ſelfes to haue fledde vnto the Duke, and by that meanes ſearche foorthe and knowe the whole entente of theyr coniuracion, and after what waye they framed theyr matters.
                  Other alſo ſhoulde promyſe a pardon and remyſſyon vnto ſyr Roberte Clyfforde, and Willyam

Barley for their offence cōmitted to the kyng. And when they had ſo dooen, many of theim returned to Englande, and broughte the names of certayne that were chief of the ſame conſpiracye, Other taried vntyll ſuche tyme that ſir Robert Clifforde came to Englande agayne. And when the kyng had knowen the chief capitaines of this tumulte by his ſpyes that were there with theim, he cauſed all them to bee attached &amp; brought to London before his preſēce, whoſe names wer ſir Iohn Ratclyffe, ſyr Simon Monforde, ſyr Thomas Thwarte knightes, William Dabeney, Roberte Ratcliffe, Richard Leſey, wt many other. Alſo certaine preeſtes and religious menne, as ſir William Richeford, and Thomas Poynes bothe monkes of ſainct Dominikes order, ſir William Sutton, ſir William Vrſeley Deane of Poules, &amp; Robert Layborne. Other that were giltie of the ſame crime, hearing that many of their compaignie wer taken, fledde and did take ſanctuarye. And the other that were taken wer condempned all of treaſon, of ye whiche there was heded ſir Simon Monford, ſir Robert Ratcliffe, and William Dabeney as authours &amp; chiefe capitaines of this buſines. The other were pardoned, and the Preeſtes alſo for their order that they had taken. Alſo ſir Iohn Ratcliffe was pardoned of his lyfe, but after that he came to Caliſſe, &amp; there caſte in priſone, he was behedded, becauſe he corrupted the kepers wt many promiſes to haue eſcaped out of the ſame. Shortly after, ſir Robert Clifford truſting to find fauour &amp; grace at the kynges hande, came to England, of whoſe cōming when ye kyng was certified

he went ſtreight to ye towre of London, &amp; there taryed tyll ſuche tyme ye ſyr Robert Clyfford came whiche thyng he vſed vnder this pretence, that yf ſir Robert Clifford had accuſed any man to hym of ye treaſon, that then euerie ſuche perſon mighte bee called thether withoute anye ſuſpectiō of anie euel, and there ſtreight to bee caſt in holde, but before I goo furder, I wyll ſhewe the opinion that many men conceaued of the knightes goynge to Flaunders. Some men helde this opinion, that kyng Henrye dyd ſende hym as a ſpye to Flaunders, and therfore he came the ſoner into his fauoure. Neuertheleſſe, this is not lyke to bee true by diuerſe reaſōs. Fyrſt that it tourned to ye great infamye and hurt, both of hym ſelfe and his frendes. Secondarly that he was not in ſo greate fauoure with the kyng, as he had ben in tymes paſt for becauſe that he was giltie in that part. Therfore the ſaied ſir Robert now comming to the king after his retourne into England, kneled mekelye downe at his feet, and deſired pardō of his grace and after that beyng enquired of the coniuration and examined who wer the authours of this miſchiefe, he pronounced &amp; ſaied that William Stā
                     ly whome the kynge made Earle, was one of the chief, when he had ſo ſaied, the kyng was greatly diſmayed &amp; greued, that he ſhould offend, whō he had made chief of his priuie chamber, conſidering alſo that he had founde great kindenes hertofore at his hande, and that he dyd ouercome kyng Rychard chiefly by his helpe and meanes. So that the kyng coulde not bee perſwaded, that he was any ſuche offender, had not it bene ſhewed him after

by manifeſt tokens and apparēt argumentes ye it was true as he ſaied. Whom the king thē cauſed to be taken and examined of the matter, after the which examinacion he was proued to be an offender. Then the kynge doubtynge what to dooe with him, dyd conſult and breath a lytle with him ſelfe, for he feared, that his brother lord Thomas by whom he had ſhewed great kyndneſſe woulde take it greuouſly, alſo &amp; yf he ſhoulde remitte that faulte, other would abuſe his lemtee, and treſpace more highly. Albe it, at the laſte he wylled that he ſhoulde ſuffer for his offence, and ſo cauſed hym to bee behedded. The cauſe that their loue (as mē reporte) dyd chaunge into hatred was this. The lorde Wylliā conſideryng that he ſaued the kyng and brought hym to this realme to be gouernour thought he could neuer bee recompenſed for hys ſo doyng, and wher as the kyng alſo remembring this benefyte, dyd make hym his chiefe chamberlayn, and gaue hym the hygheſt promocions that he had, he lytle regarded them and loked for ſome greater rewarde, wherfore, the king perceauynge that, was ſore greued with hym, and ſo thei bothe dyd fall at debate and hatred eche wyth other.
                  Alſo at this time the king thought beſt to vſe ſome aſperite in correcting the offēces of his ſubiectes, becauſe ye ſome had taken ſuche heart and audacitee to them, ye thei feared not to ſpeake euel of his maieſtie with moſt ſpiteful and contumeleous wordes, truſting euer that ye fayned Rychard duke of York, now lately ryſen from death to lyfe on gods name, ſhould claime the crowne, &amp; enheret his counterfeted fathers poſſeſſions, &amp; when

ſuch perſōs had ſuffered due poniſhment for their offences, other learning by their neighbours miſchaunce to beware, dyd frome ye tyme beare theim ſelfes as true &amp; faithfull ſubiectes, &amp; aſſyſted him with al their power, at what time he required help of thē. After the death of this William Stanley, Giles Dabeney was choſen and made chiefe chā
                     berlain. And now ye kyng was in a good ſtaye for his realme, ſauyng yt Ireland was not wel weded of the pernicious ſede ye was ſowed by the young mā Perkin Warbeck and his ſecte. Wherfore, he ſent ſir Henry Deny late abbot of Lanktō abbey thither, &amp; made him chauncellour ouer al that Ile and Edward Ponyng to ſerch all places that the forenamed Perken was in, to puniſh thē extremely in the example of other, ye were giltie of yt crime but when thei heard of this, thei fled for the moſt part into woddes &amp; maryſh places for the defence &amp; ſafgard of them ſelfes, there conſultyng to kepe open warre agaynſt hym, whiche Edwarde after that he perſued theim many times, and coulde neuer try it wyth them becauſe thei wer ſo diſparſed as foren and wilde people, he returned backe, and ſuſpectinge that the earle of Kyldare was the occaſion of this, attached him at the counſayl of the erle his euel willers, and brought him as priſoner to England. Wher when he was arained, and certain matters of treaſon laied to his charge, he aduoided thē all, &amp; clerly quite him ſelfe: whome the kynge dimiſſed, and ſente hym to Irelande there to bee gouernour and captayne ouer theim as he was before. So that now the kyng beeyng oute of all feare of battayle, dyd take hys progreſſe to

ſhyre, there to recreate his ſpirites and ſolace him ſelfe with his mother lady Margarete, wyfe and counteſſe to the Earle of Darby. Yet when ye king was thus delityng hym ſelfe, Perken Warbecke could not moderate or rule hym ſelfe, although ſo manye ſuffered and were put to execucion for his miſchife but to proue again the chaunce of battel gathered a great armye of men aſwell priſoners, ſlaues, ſānctuary men as other &amp; came into Kent, becauſe the wind ſo ſerued, &amp; ther cauſed certayne to land, &amp; to enquire yf ye Kentiſh men would bear with him, with whō the Kentiſh mē working guiles promiſed ye thei would aſſiſt him, yf he &amp; his cō
                     panie would land ther. Albeit, the ſame Perkē fearing ye thei meaned falſhode and craft, would not deſcende him ſelfe, but cauſed certain of his ſouldiours to lande, whiche perſones beynge a pretye way from their ſhippes, wer ſore beatē and put to flight, and many of theim taken priſoners &amp; after wer condempned to dye. Wherfore Perkē failing of his purpoſe fled backe to Flaunders, and there conſulted with his frendes vntyll ſuche time he had been better prepared bothe of men and counſayle. The kynge herynge that hys enemyes had made ētraūce into his realme, left of his progreſſe &amp; purpoſed to go to London, but beynge certified the next day after, how wel thei had ſped, continued &amp; went forth of his progreſſe, ſendyng to theim Richard Gilford, to geue thankes and promiſe of a good turne herafter, for ye good ſeruice that thei had done him in thoſe tumultes and aſſaultes of his enemies. Alſo that thei might not haue any acceſſe herafter into thoſe parties the king commaū
                     ded

ye lordes to bee defēded ſtrōgely wt bulwarkes &amp; other ſure munimētes &amp; fortreſſes, of the whiche this ſame Perken beyng certified, haſtened ye more to renue battaill againſt the kyng, yt he might not haue longer ſpace, through his delaye, to dooe all theſe thynges for the defence of his realme and ſo came to Irelande with all his armie, and there tariyng a ſpace, ſailed to Scotlande for ayde and ſuccour of kyng Iames, truſtyng to finde grace at his hand, to whom he ſpake after this maner. I thinke it is not vnknowē to you moſte noble kyng in what ruine the ſtocke of Edwarde the fourth of that name is now of late, whiche if you dooe not know, and it pleaſe your grace ſo to take me I am his ſoonne, &amp; by the power of God, preſerued a liue at this houre from the mightie hand of a tiranne. For my father when he died, apointed his brother Richard duke of Glouceſtre to bee our gouernour &amp; ꝓtectour. Albeit he was rather a deſtroyer of our progenie then a mainteiner of it, for he wyllyng to be kyng hymſelf, and depriue vs of our right and title, commaunded that we ſhould bothe bee ſlain, and diſpatched out of this worlde. Therfore he hauyng then full power to ordre vs at his will, did cauſe my brother to bee deſtroyed, and becauſe yt he might bee without ſome parte of that offenſe, and not ſhewe hymſelf all a tirāne, he cauſed me to bee conueighed to ſome ſtraunge and foren countree, and there to bee deſolate of all comforte and helpe. And ſo kyng Richard did hold his croūe by diſpatchyng away of vs two, ſo that I could not tell by the reaſon of my tendre age, what I was, vntill now of late that myne aunte ladie Margarete

beyng in Flaūders did ſhewe me what I was after ſhe had ſeen me, and to the entent I might recouer again my fathers poſſeſſions, ſhe hath geuen me for her power a bonde of mēne, wyllyng me ye I ſhould deſire the helpe of externe nacions and countrees. And ſo I am come to you for ſuccoure, whō as it is reported will helpe at all tymes euery manne in his right, and in caſe bee I ſhall finde you fauorable to me, you ſhall binde me and all myne, neuer to thynke ourſelfes hable to make you amendes. When he had thus ſaied, the kyng promiſed hym that it ſhould neuer repente hym of his commyng to hym, and bad him to take a good hearte, &amp; after this the kyng aſſemblyng his counſaill together, aſked what thei thought beſt in that matter, and whether any deliberacion ſhould bee takē of it, or no. To whom ſome of theim that were w
                        •
                     ſeſt, aunſwered that it were foliſhenes to go fur
                     
                        〈…〉
                      in ſuche a matter, conſideryng that he was but a painted and feigned duke and had no right to England. Other alſo ſaied that it was for diuerſe cauſes moſte profitable to the cōmen wealth, partely that this Parkyn, if his matters goo well forwarde, would rewarde theim, as thei would deſire and enriche their realme moſte plentefully by his liberalite, partely alſo that Henry the kyng perceiuyng their kyng to aſſiſt hym, would gladly paie tribute to hym for a peace and concord to bee had. When this counſaill was gyuen, the kyng did gladly folowe it, and that his loue might bee more apparent to the people, he cauſed ladie Katherine doughter to therle of Hūtley, his nigh kinſemā, to be maried to hym. After this was dooen, the kyng

willyng yt this Perkyn ſhould reigne in Englāde, haſtened his iourney towarde the borders, &amp; there cōmyng, proclamed openly ye all ſhould bee pardoned ye would beare with the duke of Yorke, &amp; fight in his quarell: and that mēne might for feare ſubmitte theim ſelfes, thei burned, ſpoyled, &amp; killed wt out all mercie as ferre as thei did go, but the kyng perceiuyng yt no Engliſhemen came to aide this young duke, &amp; that his ſouldiours wer ſo loden wt praies &amp; ſpoiles yt thei would not gladly go further he returned backe to Scotlād cariyng wt hym infinite goodes &amp; riches. And when this duke came to Scotlande again, conſideryng the greate diſtruccion and loſſe of the Engliſhmen, &amp; that none came to aide hym, to the entēt that his iuglyng of his countrefeict dignite might not be perceiued, he ſaied verie craftely with a loude voice. Oh wretch and ſtonie hearte, that I am not moued with the loſſe and death of ſo many Engliſhemen of myne, and at that woorde he deſired the kyng yt he would not moleſtate his realme herafter with ſuche cruel tormentyng, and fieryng. To whom the kyng ſhaped hym this aunſwere right ſhortely. Truely ſir me thynke you take charge and thought of an other mannes realme and not of your owne, becauſe that I coulde ſe no manne that woulde take your parte, and helpe you with his power, whē you were now laſt emong theim. And for this cauſe ye kyng did litle eſteme hym after that tyme, countyng hym incōſtant, vnſtable, and ſpeakyng woordes not agreyng to his promiſe. When ye Engliſh lordes and captaines hearde of this buſines thei wer in greate feare, &amp; fled for ſafegade of their

lifes euery manne to his caſtell and holde, and gatheryng an axmie to withſtand their enemies certified the kyng in all poſt haſte of the Scottes enterpriſe, whiche hearyng, prepared an armie in all the haſt to fight againſt theim. But the Scottes beyng lodē with their praies and ſpoiles that thei had, were gone backe to their countre, ere the Engliſhe menne could bee readie. And this was the firſt commocion &amp; buſines of the Scottes againſt the Engliſhemen. When the Scottes were thus gone, and the kyng certified of it, he thought not to ſuffer theim lenger, leſte that by long tariyng &amp; deferryng of ye matter, thei ſhould take heart, and ſo with more fearſenes inuade the realme again.
                  And aſſemblyng his counſaill together, ſhewed theim that it was for the proffite of the publique weale to warre againſt his enemies, to whom thei all agreed right gladly, and for the mainteinyng of this battaill, there was leuyed a certain ſumme or tribute to be paid on euery mannes hed, whiche paiment although it was but eaſie and ſmall, yet many of the commen people grudged to paie it. At this parliament alſo and conuocacion there was certain lawes, actes and ſtatutes confirmed and made, as thought moſte expediēt for the publique weale. And after this was dooen, the kyng prepared to fight in all the haſte, and gatheryng an armie, made Giles Dabeney graund capitain ouer theim, and in his goyng to Scotlande, there beganne ſodenly ciuile battaill in the realme, whiche was for the paiment of this money, for that ye Corniſhemen, (whiche made this inſurreccion) beeyng but poore, could not well paie this tribute.

And ſo they gatheryng all together, one Michael Ioſeph Smyth and Thomas Flāmoke, did take * The blacke Smyth. vpon theim the gouernaunce of all this compainie. And ſeyng theim greued ſore that they ſhould paye ſo muche, did more and more incenſe theyr myndes againſte their prynce. Albeit they layde this faulte, and cauſe of exaction, to Ihon Mortō biſhoppe of Cātorbury, and Ruigenald Braye becauſe they were chief of the kynges houſe.
                  Thus they preparyng theim ſelues to warre, whē they had aſwell ſufficiente viandrye as all other thynges ready, they tooke theyr iourney to Welles, and from thence entended to go to London, When the kyng was ſhewed of this by his auditours, that they wer vp, and that the lorde Twychet, and the lorde Audely with other of the nobylitee had taken their partes, he thought fyrſte to ſcoure his realme of ſuche rebelles and traytours ere he would fight againſt the Scottes. And therfore he cauſed Giles Dabeney to returne backe agayn then goyng vpon the Scottes, whoſe armye he encreaſed and multiplyed with many pycked and freſhe warryers, that he might the better with leſſe laboure ouercome theſe rebelles. Alſo leaſt that the Scottes might nowe (hauyng good oportunite) inuade the realme again (in this time of ciuile battyle) he cauſed lorde Thomas erle of Surrey, a puiſſaunt and moſt redoubted warryer whome he had taken pryſoner, at the ouerthrowe of kyng Richard, and a litle before that, had ſet at libertie, and made treaſourer of Englāde, after the death of Iohn Dynham, to gather a bond of men at Durham, &amp; there to kepe of ye Scottes, yf they

ſhould chaunce to come, vntyll ſuche tyme that yt Cornyſhe menne beyng pacified and ſubdued, he might ſend to theim the forenamed Giles agayne with all his power and armye. When as the nobles hearde of this buſynes, they came to London euery mā, with as many as they could make, to ayde the kyng, yf nede ſhoulde be. In the which compaignie there was the erle of Eſſex, the lorde Mongey, the erle of Suffolke, Richard Thomas, William Say, lorde Haward the erle of Surrey his ſonne a noble young man &amp; of ſtoute courage

                  In this meane ſpace, Charles ye Frenche kyng commyng from the warres that he had at Naples with Ferdinande, ſente Ambaſſadours to the kyng for a peace and league of amitee to bee confirmed. When the kyng was enformed of their cō
                     myng, and that they were at Caleis, he ſente certayn of his nobilitie to mete theim commyng, and to kepe theim purpoſely at Douer, vntyll ſuche tyme that this buſyneſſe were ended, that they might not knowe of it in any wiſe.
                  And nowe the Cornyſhemenne gooynge from Welles (where they had theyr graunde capitayne lorde Audeley) went to Sauliſbury and frō thence to Wyncheſter, and ſo to Kent, where they looked for helpe, but they were deceaued, for the earle of Kent, and the lorde of Burgone Poole, the lorde Cobham, Thomas Burcher, Edwarde Ponyng, Richard Gilforde, Wyllyam Scotte, Iames Cromer, Ihon Peche, Iohn Darel, Henry Wyat Rychard Haulte, Ihon Fogge, and other were ready to withſtande theyr power, and to cauſe the people to beare trewe heartes to theyr kynge. For the whiche, many of the Cornyſhe men faynted and had leſſe mynde to fight, and for feare fled priuely in the nyght from their compaignie. But the captaynes perceauyng they coulde haue no helpe at theyr handes, truſted to theyr owne power, and brought theim to Blackeheath feld nigh London, and there pytched theyr tentes in the

playn to byd battail to the kyng, if he would mete theim, or els to inuade the cytie, whome the kynge perceauyng to be there readye to fight, he cauſed Henry Burſchere erle of Eſſex, Edmunde Polam erle of Suffolke and Richard Thomas, three noble warryers to beſiege theim on both ſydes wyth two wynges, and ſo came hym ſelf in the myddeſt ſendyng before, Giles Dabeney with a greate power. And after his commyng thus to the felde, bothe the erles and Richard Thomas ſette vpon theim violently, and at the firſt brunt put theim to flight and killed aboute two thouſande that reſ

                     ſied, and tooke priſoners more then could bee told and emonges theim ye Captaynes which ſhortely after wer put to death. But this Michael Ioſeph was a mā of ſuche ſtoute courage &amp; valiaūtneſſe, yt he neuer fainted or once gaue backe vntyll ſuch tyme he was ſtryken downe, and kylled openly.
                  When this battaile was ended the kynge loſte but thre hundreth in all his compaignye that wer kylled at that preſente. Alſo the pryſoners that were taken he pardoned, ſauyng the captaynes and firſt autours of that miſchief, whoſe quarters he would haue to bee put on ſtakes and ſet in dyuerſe places of Cornewell, that theyr naughtie dooynges and fooliſhe entrepryſes might bee a document for other hereafter to beware: but becauſe there were many of that coūtree that would gladly haue renewed battaile, yf they might haue had ſome Capitayn, and yt they wer nothyng abaſhed for ye ouerthrowe of theyr late inſurreccion, he turned his mynd, ſo yt thei wer not had thither nor their quarters ſet vpō any ſtakes there. Whē this

buſines was in hād, ye kyng of Scottes being certified of it by certain ſpies, thought beſt to inuade Englande againe, and burned all the waye as he did before, leſt that the kyng ſhould prouoke hym to it of force, becauſe he had dooen ſo muche hurte to it before, and thus came to Durham and there burned all aboute, entending alſo to wynne Norham Caſtle, whiche the Biſhoppe had furniſhed a litle before with menne and vitaile ſufficiently, ſo that he coulde haue none acceſſe into that caſtell. And this was the biſhop Foxe, that was biſhop of Exeter, and for his godlines and verteouſe liuing after that, made biſhoppe of Welles and Bathe. Whiche biſhop nowe being in this buſineſſe, certified the kyng of it in all the haſte, and alſo therle of Surrey, that was then in Yorke ſhyre with a greate army of menne. To whome the Erle came ſhortly after, with his compaignye, and after hym folowed other noble menne of all quarters, euery one bringīg for his habilitee as many as he could to aide the biſhop, and fight in the defence &amp; quarell of theyr kyng. And in this compaygnie was there many Lordes therle of Weſtmerland, Thomas Dacres, George Graunge, Rafe Neuel, Richard Latimer, George Lumley, Iohn Scroppe, George Oglie, Thomas Baron of Hilton, Henry Clifford, William Coyners, Thomas Dercy.

                  With many other Capitaynes, althoughe not ſo noble in degree, yet as valiaunte in martiall feactes and proweſſes of warre. The Scottes hearing of the Earle of Surrey that he was cōming and at hande with a greate power, then beſeging this forenamed Caſtell, whiche they coulde by no meanes ouercome, they fledde ſtreighte backe to Scotlande, whome the Earle folowed as longe as his vyttailles ſerued, and after that returned backe to Durham, theyr abiding vntyll ſuch time he knewe furder of the kynges pleaſure.
                  And in this meane ſpace, one Henrye Hailes was ſente Ambaſſadoure frome Ferdinand vnto the kyng of Scottes for a generall peace to bee had with hym and the Kyng of Englande, for he loued hym well, and kyng Henrye alſo to whoſe ſoonne the younge Prynce Arthure, he woulde haue geuen his doughter Ladye Katheryne in

mariage that by affinytee and kyndered of blood their loue might continue for euer.
                  So this Henrye entreated hartelye the King of Scottes for a peace, and when he had ſome hope in it, he wrote vnto the kyng of Englande, that it would pleaſe hym to ſende one of his nobles to helpe to conclude this matter with hym and the Scottes. The kyng becauſe he had been in greate trouble and then veraye deſierous of peace, he ſent the byſhoppe of Durham to hym in all the haſte. So that this Henrye and the biſhop reaſoned with the Scottyſhe ambaſſadours as concernyng this peace to be had, albeit thei could not agree, becauſe that kyng Henrye deſiered to haue Perkyn Warbecke that was the cauſe of all this buſynes, and had ſo greatly diſquieted his realme, whome the kyng woulde not delyuer, although he might of ryghte, conſideryng his falſehode and deceyte that he had vſed with hym.
                  Therfore, after that they had reaſoned much of this matter, &amp; could bring it to no ende, yet a truce was taken for certain yeres of this condicion, that the ſame Perkin Warbecke ſhould bee conueyghed oute of Scotland, &amp; not to tary there longer. Whyle this was dooinge, kyng Henry cauſed the Ambaſſadours of ye Frenche kyng to bee brought to hym, which as it is ſhewed before, wer ſtopped at Douer of their iourney, vntill ſuche tyme yt the inſurreccion of the Eorniſh men was ceaſſed, and hearing yt they came for a peace and league to bee made, graūted theim it right gladly. So yt nowe beīg reconciled wt .ii. kynges, &amp; theſame his neighbours, he thanked Fernand &amp; his wife Elizabeth

for ye they cauſed this peace to bee made betwixte hym and the Scottes, and rewarded the Ambaſſadoure moſte worthely after a princely maner.
                  And the tyme that this vnitee and concorde was made, it was the yere of oure Lorde a thouſande foure hundreth foure ſcore and eighten, and ye .xii. yere of kyng Henry his reigne.
                  And the kynge of Scottes kepte his promeſſe The .xii. pere of Hē
                        ry the .vii. well ynoughe. For when he perceiued manifeſtly that he was deluded, he called vnto hym Perkin Warbeck, and firſt declared his benefites &amp; pleaſures that he had dooen vnto hym, and then counſailed hym to gette hym vnto ſome place where he mighte byde in ſafegarde, and come againe another time when he ſhoulde haue more oportunitee But neuer after to looke for any helpe at his hād, partely becauſe he had made peace with the kyng of Englande, and partely becauſe he ſawe that no Engliſhemen came to take his parte, wherfore he deſired hym not to bee miſgreued that he did thus leaue hym, &amp; alſo counſailed hym to goo into ſome other place or regyon, wherfore this Perkin was veraye ſorye &amp; (as the kyng had counſailed hym) departed thence with his wife, and went into Ireland, determining with hym ſelfe if he might haue no helpe of the menne of Cornewale, to retourne thence as faſte as myghte bee home to his greate mailres &amp; aunte Margaret into Flaundres. But he was no ſoner come thither, then he heard by diuers meſſengers yt they of Cornewale were as ready to fyght againſt kyng Henry as euer they wer before, of hoope of the whiche he went ſtreyght in to Cornewall &amp; there dyd ſturre vp their heartes

with gyftes and promyſes, that all immediatelye called him their capitain &amp; ſaied that thei woulde folow hym and in all thinges obey promptly hys commaundementes. Thē was Perkē in as good hoope as euer he was, and (becauſe he would do nothynge raſhelye and withoute aduiſemente) he purpoſed fyrſte to ouercome citees and all wel defēded places that lay in his way, and ſo to get as many as he coulde to folowe hym and to take his part, and incontinently, to buckle with ye kynges hoſt. Whē he had thus deliberate, he wēt ſtreight to Exeter which was the next citee that he coulde come vnto and beſieged it, and becauſe he had no gunnes to breake downe the walles, he laboured all that myght bee to breake the gates, but when he ſaw that thei could not eaſely be betten downe with any thyng, ſtreight with he ſet fyre on theim.
                  Whereof, the citezins were veray, ſore afraied and priuely in the night let downe diuerſe ouer ye walles with ropes to go certifie the kyng of their trouble, and in the meane tyme whē thei ſaw that their enemies had almoſt brēt vp the gates of the one ſide, tooke great blockes and ſet them on fyre on the other ſide, for none other cauſe but that aſwell their enemyes therby might be excluded, as thei them ſelfes included. And thei not truſting to this only, made alſo wtin great ditches &amp; other thī
                     ges to defend thē from the inuaſiō of the rebelles When Perkē ſaw this, he got ladders, and would by that meanes haue come into the citee, but they came not ſo ſone vp, but thei were beate downe again, and by this meanes many were there ſlayne þet would he not thence depart, but truſted ſurely

at the laſte that thei ſhould be glad to yelde theim ſelfes al that wer within for lack of viandrie. But as ſone as the kyng hearde of this, he haſted with his hooſt toward Exeter as faſte as was poſſible and ſente dyuerſe ſouldiours beefore to certifie all menne of his commyng and preparaunce, for at that tyme there was ſet forth to helpe theym of Exeter, Thomas Trencherd, William Corteney Walter Cortney, Edmond Carre, Ihon Halemel Peter Eggecomb Thomas Fulford, Ihō Crook William Saintmaur, with a great hoſt whoſe capitain was Edward Corteny erle of Denſhire, &amp; his ſonne William, whiche was a young man of mooſte noble courage, whiche thyng when Peter heard tell of, he left beſiegyng of Exeter and went to ye nexte towne whiche is called Taūtun &amp; there vieued his hooſt and ſet it in aray redye to fyght, howbeit,, he had but lytle affiaunce in the ſame, becauſe many of his ſouldiours were ſo ſlenderly harneiſſed, and no better ſkylled in warre. When the kyng ſawe he was gone to Taūtun he haſted thither after him with all ſpede. Thether came alſo Edward ye duke of Buckingham a young mā veray valiaunt and of luſtie courage, and hym folowed a greate compaignye of noble men as Giles Brigge, Alexander Brayhā, Moryſhe Barkeley, Robert Tame, Ihon Sapcot, Ihon Wadhā, Hugh Lutrel, and Nycholas hys ſonne, William S

                  But the king when he came nygh to the towne ſente before to begynne battayle, Roberte Broke, Lorde Rycharde Thomas, and Giles Dabeney with a great and ſtronge hooſt, to the entent that he hym ſelfe with his ſouldiours myght ſet vpon them behynd. But this deuiſe and purpoſe of the kyng was al ſuperfluous. For Perkin, ſo ſone as he eſpyed that the kyng was redie to fight, fledde priuely in the nyght into a ſanctuary at Bellylo abbey, and there lurked. But whether this Perkē ſo dyd for feare leaſt his men ſhould forſake hym or for the timeditie of hym ſelfe, it is as much vncertayne, as it is probable and ſure that the kyng tooke by hys flyght greate commoditee.
                  For the Corneſhe menne were ſurelye purpoſed eyther to wynne and ouercome theyr enemies or elles not one of theim to haue lyued anye daye lenger. When kynge Henrye knewe that Perkin was gone, he ſente after hym many horſe menne that yf it myghte bee, they ſhoulde ouertake hym in hys iourney and brynge hym backe.
                  But Perkyn Warbecke made ſuche ſpede, that he was not ſeene before he came into the Sanctuarie, but his petie capitaines coulde not ſcape ſo clene. For of theim, the mooſt part were ta

ken and brought backe againe to the kyng. The reſidue of the ſouldiours when thei vnderſtode ye Perkyn their chief capitain was fled and ye other taken, gaue vp theim ſelfes by and by to the king without any more buſines, and of hym moſt gently wer forgeuen. When all was dooen, the kynge went again to Ereter and there both gaue great thankes to ſuch as wer worthy, and puniſhed the authoures and ſturrers vp of this inſurrection mooſt ſtraitlye. And in ye meane tyme many of the ſouldiours road to ſ. Mighels mounte &amp; there (as chaunce was) found Katherin Perking wife, and brought her ſtreight like a bond woman and captiue to the kyng. And the kyng ſent her by and by accompanied with a goodly ſort of matrons (becauſe ſhe was ſo goodly a young woman) to London to the quene as a true and ſure token of vyctorie. And whiles he taried there at Exeter ſuppoſyng with him ſelfe, that he could haue no perfect victory vntyl he had gottē Perkin him ſelf, which was the beginner of all this ſedicion and ſtrife, ſent forth two companies of menne to beſiege the ſanctuarye wher Perkin was, that by no meanes he myght ſcape away, and ſent him worde alſo by certain truſtie meſſengers that yf he would humblie ſubmit him ſelfe, he ſhould be forgeuen of all that was committed. Wherfore, Perkin now ſeynge and ponderynge the ſtate of miſerie, that he was in, wēt voluntarily out of the ſanctuary and commytted hym ſelfe to the kynges pleaſure.
                  Then was the kyng weray glad and toke his iourney immediatly after towarde London, not without the great metyng of people whych came

out of euery quarter to ſe this feloe as he were a monſtre, becauſe he beyng but an aliente durſt bee ſo bold to come in to this ſo noble a realme to make battaill, and delude noble menne after ſuche a faſſion. But whē the kyng was come to London he appointed certain menne to kepe hym bothe night &amp; daie verie vigilantly, to thentent that he might neither conueigh hymſelf out of the lande, ner goo any whether within this realme to make any like perturbacion and diſquietnes.
                  After this the kyng perceiuyng ye there were many as well in Somerſet as in Deuēſhire, whiche were helpers of the rebelles greatly, bothe goyng foorth &amp; commyng homeward, thought it good to puniſhe theim alſo, leaſt peraduenture thei might be ye more bold to dooe a like thyng after. And therfore he committed this buſines to Amis Paulet knight, and Robert Sherburne deane of Poules to be dooen. Which in ſerchyng out all ſuche thoroweout bothe the ſhires, wer verie exacte and diligent, but thei wer fauorable to al ſuch as did it for feare or compulſion. Yet were thei to none ſo fauorable but thei were thought for their defaultes indifferently to be puniſhed. So that equitie therin was verie well executed.
                  In the ſame yere of a ſmall matter befell greate ſtrife betwene kyng Henry and Iames kyng of Scotlande, whiche ſtrife beganne of this faſſion. Certain younge menne of ye Scottes came armed vnto Dureſme caſtell, &amp; beheld it wonderous circumſpectly as though thei had been deſierous to know what was there dooen. But whē the kepers of the caſtle could not perceaue yt thei went aboute

any hurte or diſpleaſure, &amp; ſeing theim go awaie of their owne accorde, thei made no woordes but let theim alone. But when thei came again the nexte daie &amp; vieued it likewiſe, the kepers of ye ſaid caſtel demaunded of theim what was their intent. Thei aūſwered theim (like rude and vnmanerlie ientlemenne) as frowardly as could bee thought, in ſo muche yt at the laſte through muche altercacion of bothe parties, thei fell together by the eares, and there were ſome of the Scottes ſlain &amp; the reſidue put to flight. Which whē thei came home certified their kyng of theſame. Wherwith he beyng ſore moued to angre, ſēt woorde to kyng Henry that he would wtout doubt reuenge his querell, wherfore kyng Hēry being verie ſorie, not ſo much forfeare, as for to liue in quietnes &amp; peace in his age, made him aūſwere yt it was not doē through his default or coūſaill, but rather by the raſheneſſe of his ſubiectes whiche if thei could bee ꝓued guiltie ſhould be accordyng to the faulte puniſhed. Wherfore he deſired him moſte louingly to be cōtēted. But this was not hable to mitigate or ſwage the Scottes angre &amp; outrageouſneſſe. For the whiche cauſe Richard biſhop of Dureſme whiche was more heuie then all other, becauſe his ſeruūates were ye beginners of this diſcord, wrote many letters to kyng Iames to deſire hym to kepe peace &amp; bee at quiet. With the whiche letters the kynges rage was ſo quenched, yt he bothe ſent verie kynd letters again to hym, and deſired hym hartely to come ouer and talke with hym. Of ye whiche tydynges the biſhop was verie glad, and went ſtreight to kyng Henry to ſhewe hym the matter and had leaue of hym incontinenly

to go ouer to hym.
                  When he came into Scotlāde, he was receiued as louyngly as coulde bee thought of the kyng hymſelf, at an abbey called Melroſe, and there after that he had complained muche of the crueltie that was vſed toward his menne here in Englāde he beganne to commen ſecretly of other matters, and eſpecially of the amitie betwene kyng Henry and hym, the whiche to bee for euer ſtabliſhed and confirmed, he deſired yt kinges doughter Margaret in mariage. Of the whiche thyng albeit the biſhop was glad in his heart, yet he would make no perfect aunſwere or ſheweforth any ſure hope of ye ſame, but ſaied that when he came home, he would dooe the beſt in the matter that laie in hym. Wherfore the kyng ſhortly after dimiſſed hym, and deſired hym erneſtly to breake ye ſame matter to kyng Hēry. And whē he was come home, ſo he did, and ye proffer pleaſed ye kyng verie well, becauſe he was a manne whiche was alwaies more delited wt peace &amp; quietnes then wt the troubleſomneſſe, of battaill.
                  And now did approch ye death of Perkin Warbeck, and of Edwarde erle of Warwicke whiche had ſo long lyen all readie in the tower. But Perkē thought that he would ſaue hymſelf, and therfore on a tyme he tooke his leggues and ranne awaie, but ſo ſone as the kyng harde tell therof, he made menne after hym with all the ſpede ye might bee, wt whoſe clamours and ſhoutes Perkyn was ſo feared, yt of neceſſitie he was compelled to go to an abbaie which was called Bethelē, &amp; ther intreacted ye abbot of the place to deſire the kyng of his pardon that he might not dye. Whiche thyng the

abbot did for hym and obteined it. Wherfore Perken was brought bounde &amp; feitered, to Weſtminſter and there ſtoode an whole daie in the ſight of all menne to the great ſhame and reproche of hym ſelf. And after (partely becauſe the kyng had promiſed hym his life, and partely becauſe he ſhould no more renne awaie) he was cōmitted to ye towre. Where his wickednes boylong ſo hote within his breit, would not ſuffre hym to eſcape the vēgeaūce &amp; puniſhemēt of God, but ſhortly after was moſte iuſtly &amp; worthely put to deathe as herafter ſhalbe ſhewed. Then it chaunſed ye a monke whoſe name was Patricke had a ſcholer, whome he promiſed if he would folowe his counſaill, ſhould eaſely come to the kyngdome of Englande. Whiche ſcholer when he had ones heard his maiſters mynd, was verie inſtaunte in the matter and deſired his maiſter, not to forget his purpoſe, but rather begynne it as ſone as was poſſible. Wherfore, when thei be twene theim ſelfes had taken deliberacion and counſailled of the thyng how it ſhould be brought to paſſe, thei went bothe together into Kent. And there beganne this young feloe to tell priuely to many that he was the erle of Warwicke, and had gotte out of the tower by the helpe of this monke. To the whiche, when he perceiued credence geuen he declared it openly, and deſyred al men of helpe.
                  But or euer this ſedicion beganne to goo foreward, the heddes and principalles of theſame wer taken and caſle into pryſone. Of whiche the one was condempned to death, and the other condēpned to perpetuall pryſon and darkeneſſe. For at that tyme here in Englande was ſo muche attrybuted

to preſtes, and al religious mē, that though they had committed felonie, murder, yea or treaſon, they ſhould not haue bene therfore condempned to death. Moreouer, whoſoeuer could reade, though it wer neuer ſo lytle, what crime ſoeuer he had committed (ſaue treaſon) ſhould by his booke bee ſaued, and therfore it was inuented, that if the default wer ſo great, that another manne ſhoulde ſuffer death for theſame, he ſhould onely be burnt in the hande, wherfore he ye had committed thefte, ſhould bee marked in the hand with this letter T. if he had committed murdre, with M. and after that, yf he were deprehended in lyke cryme, then there ſhould no fauour at all, more then to other menne, bee ſhewed. Whiche acte was made and confyrmed, by this kyng Henry in the ſecond yere of his reigne, and takē of the Frenchemen, whiche are wonte if thei take any ſuche, to cutte of one of his cares and let hym go. Whiche priuiledges of bookes made thefes both bolde, &amp; plentie thorowe out all the coaſtes and parties of this his realme of Englande.
                  But nowe to my matier again. Perkyn, of whom we ſpake muche before, whyles he was in ye towre corrupted many of the kepers, partly with giftes and partely with fayre promyſes, ſo that they were all agreed (ſaue the leuetenaunt, whome he fully determined to kyll) that he and the erle of Warwike ſhould gooe theyr waye out of the toure and afterwarde to make the beſt ſhyfte that they could for theim ſelfes. But this his purpoſe came not to full effecte. For it was knowne within ſhorte tyme after, for the whiche he and his felowes all of the

ſame counſayle were hanged by the neckes. And the earle of Warwike, becauſe he was foundegyltie in theſame defaulte, was behedded, whiche was dooen in the yeare of oure Lorde a thouſand foure hundreth and .xcix. and in the .xiii. yeare of this kyng Henry his reigne.
                  The nexte yere after, was here in Englande a 
                        
                           〈…〉

                      a greate plague wherof menne died in many places vereye ſore, but eſpeciallye and mooſte of all in London. For there died in that yere aboue thyrtye thouſande. Wherfore the kynge ſayled ouer to Caleis and there taryed a greate while. In his beyng there came ouer to hym Philippe Erle of Flaunders, and was receaued of hym as louyngly as could bee thought, and alſo or euer they departed, the league whiche was made betwene theim two not longe before was renewed.
                  Sone after, when the plague was ſlaked, the kyng returned agayne into Englande, and was no ſoner come thyther, but there met him one Gaſper Pons ſente from Alexander the byſhoppe of of Roome, which brought with hym indulgences and perdo
                        •
                     es whereby he made the kyng beleue that he and his ſhould flye ſtreight to heauen, but thoſe could not bee graunted withoute a greate ſomme of money, the whiche the rather that he might obteyne, he promyſed parte of it to the kyng hymſelfe, ſo deceauyng both ye kyng and ye people. In this ſame yere was burnt a place of ye kynges, whiche he after buylded vp againe and named it Richemount.
                  Aboute this tyme died three biſhoppes here in England, Ihon Morton biſhop of Cantourbury

Thomas Langton biſhop of Wyncheſter, and Thomas Rotherham biſhoppe of Yorke.
                  Alſo in this yere, there were greate maryages made, for kyng Henry had geuen his doughter ladye Margarete to the kyng of Scottes, and his ſonne prince Arthur to Ladie Katherine doughter to Ferdinande kyng of Spayne, whiche mariages were made ſpecially for this cauſe that he might liue in peace with thoſe kynges in his olde age.
                  After this, prynce Arthure that came to Londō purpoſely to bee maryed, went to Wales agayne with his lady and wife to ouerſee all thynges well there, and to the entente he might not miſcarye or go out of the waie in rulyng his domimon, he had with hym many noble mē, as firſt Richard Poole his nighe kynſman which was made chief of his priuie chaumbre, and Dauid Philippe huſher of his halle. Alſo he had of his counſaill certayne knyghtes as Wyllyam Vdall, Richarde Croft, Peter Neuton, Henrye Varnam, Thomas Englefelde. And other beſides theim, as Ihon Waleſtone, Henry Marine, Wyllyam Smyth preeſt chief of his coūſayle late biſhop of Lincolne, &amp; ſyr Charles Booth a lawer, then byſhop of Herforde.
                  A litle before this mariage, Edmūd Poole erle of Suffolke ſonne to ladye Elizabeth the ſyſler of kyng Edward, was accuſed for killyng of a mā, &amp; although the kyng pardoned hym, whō he might iuſtely haue condē
                     
                        •
                     ed for that offence, yet becauſe he was rayned at the barre, whiche he thought a great main and blemiſhe to his honoure, tooke it heuely, and ſhortely after fled to Flaunders wtout

any paſſeporte or licēce of the kyng, to quene Margarete his aunte, but he returned again, &amp; ſo excuſed hymſelfe before the kynge, that he was founde fautles in any thyng yt was obiected vnto hym. Alſo when this mariage was kepte at London, with great pompe &amp; ſolēnitee, this Edmunde fled again to Flaunders wt his brother Richard, either for yt he had been at great charges at theſame mariage and ſo farre caſt in debte that he was not hable to paye, either becauſe ye quene Margarete his aunte had allured hym, orels for eiuill will &amp; enuie that the kyng ſhould proſper ſo well. Whē it was knowen yt he was gooen, &amp; the kyng certified there of, he feared yt ſome buſynes ſhould ryſe by his meanes &amp; was ſory yt he had pardoned hym for his offēce lately cōmitted. But ſone after, yt the erle came from Flaunders, ſyr Robert Curſone knight &amp; capitaine of Hāmes caſtel, feignyng hym ſelfe to bee one of that conſpiracye, wente purpoſely to eſpye what the quene entended againſt kyng Henrye, whyche afterwarde for his ſo doynge was in greate fauoure wyth hym. For the kynge was ſo vigylaunte and circumſpecte in all his matters, that he dyd knowe theim namelye that either bare hym eiuill will, or woorked any in theyr mynde, whom he cauſed to bee attached and caſte in holde. And emong theim Wyllyam the erle of Deuonſhyres ſonne, whiche maried ladie Catheryne daughter to kyng Edward was taken, and another Wyllyam brother to Edmonde earle of Souffolke, Iames Tyrell, Ihon Wyndham. But theſe two wylliams were taken rather of ſuſpection then for any offence of gyltines. Wherefore

Wylliam this Earles ſonne of Deuonſhyre after the death of kynge Henrye, was deliuered &amp; had in great fauour wyth the kinges ſonne Henrye the eyght, but ſhortly after whan he beganne to exercyſe hym ſelfe agayne in marciall feates of warre, he ſickened of a dyſeaſe called (Plureſes) and died therewith, whyche becauſe it was ſtraunge and vnknowen to the phiſiciās, it was incurable. He lefte one ſonne behynde hym alyue to vphold the name of that auncetree. The other Wyllyam brother to Edmunde the earle of Suffolke had alſo greater fauoure ſhowed hym in pryſon, then he had before. And as for Iames Terel, and Ihō Wyndham, becauſe they were traytours, and manifeſtly accuſed of the ſame, wer put to death, and behedded. But when the earle of Suffolke heard of thys, he was in great deſpayre wyth hym ſelfe that he ſhould neuer frame hys matters wel, and ſo wente all aboute Germanye and Fraunce for ayde and ſocour, prouyng yf he coulde fynde any helpe at their handes, whom when he perceaued to ſhowe no token of loue towardes him in that behalfe, he made hym ſubiect to yt prynce of Flaū
                     ders, but hys brother Rychard beyng an experte man, dyd ſo wyſely order and behaue hym ſelfe in that buſineſſe, that he was not greatlye founde gyltie in any poynt of that matter. The kyng not yet beyng out of all feare of his enemyes, perceauyng that many ſanctuary men loked for a fayre daye, deſired of Alexander byſhop of Roome that all traytours and baniſhed men ſhould not be ſaued by any ſanctuary, and that ſuch as were ther in holde, ſhould take theim herafter as no refuge

and ſocoure to them, yf thei once gooe out, whych thyng, after the byſhoppe had graunted it, was to the eaſe and quietnes of al the realme.
                  When the kynge had all hys buſines ſo well ended, and broughte in a good ſtaye. Prynce Arthure dyed halfe a yeare or leſſe, after that he had maried ladie Katheryn, for whoſe death ther was great lamentynge. It is reported alſo that ladye Katherine feared ſuche lyke chaunce euermore, for becauſe yt after ſhe had taken her leaue of her parentes, and ſayled towardes England, ſhe was toſſed lōg in ye ſea, wyth the violence of the water &amp; the wynd, ere the ſhyppe coulde haue any lādyng
                  Not longe after, the quene was broughte ni bedde with a doughter, and died vppon the ſame, which daughter alſo taried but for a ſeaſon after her mother. Ther departed alſo within ſhort ſpace after, Reynalde Bray, a man for iuſtice ſo commē
                     dable, that yf any thyng had bene done agaynſte good lawe or ryght, he would ſtreyghte reproue ye kyng for it. Of the ſame vertue was Ihon Mortō biſhoppe, &amp; would do in al thinges as he did in reprouing the kinge for the reformation of thinges amiſſe, which biſhop died .ii. yeres before. About ye tyme alſo dyed Henry biſhop of Cāterbury whoſe roome Williā Warrā biſhop of Lōdon ſupplied, and in the byſhop of Londons place was elected William Barons, after whoſe deathe ſucceded Rychrde Fiziames byſhop of Chicheſter
                  In this yere, which was the .xvi. of hys reygne and of our lorde. M .ccccc. and .ii. yeres, the kynge dyd 
                        
                           〈…〉
                        
                      kept his parliament, wherin manye thynges were dereed, and made for the publike commodytee,

and emong other thynges it was determyned that theues and murderers duly conuicted by the lawe to dye, ſhould be burned in yt hand and quit yf thei could read on the booke any one worde
                  Furdermore, it was decreed yt the people ſhould paye certain mony to the kyng, and that the goodes of theim that were baniſhed and fled, ſhould be diſparſed and ſet to ſale. Alſo the preeſtes were commaunded to pay mony for the maintenaunce and ſuſtentacion of the common weale.
                  And now the kyng drawyng nigh to age, and conſideryng the great battayles that he had in tymes paſt, which (as it was thought) came of ouer muche welthines, prouided a remedy ryght ſhortly for it. And to the entent that menne ſhoulde not thynck yt he would oppreſſe them or do thē wrong for of all people he hated oppreſſours, therfore he deuiſed with hym ſelfe, by what honeſte meane he might do it, &amp; thus deuiſing called to minde yt Engliſh mē dyd litle paſſe vpō the obſeruaciō of any lawes yt were made, in ſo much, ye yf ſuch a thynge ſhould be called to accompte, he thoughte manye men as well lordes, as other of the lay fee, would bee founde fautie. And ſo ſearchyng ouer the ſtatutes that he had made, puniſhed them a lytle by the purſſe that had tranſgreſſed theim. After that he appoynted two commyſſioners to receaue the forfeictes, the one Richarde Hempſon, and the other Edmunde Dudley booth lawers of the temporaltee, whiche perſonnes for the deſire to pleaſe their king had no reſpect how thei got the monye ſo thei myght haue it ether by ryght or wrong. Albeit, ye kyng hauyng pitee of his people, after that

he perceaued they were ſore punyſhed and polled vnknowyng to hym reſtored to them their mony, of whom it was exacted vniuſtlye, and depryued thē of their offyce that had ſo vniuſtly executed it.
                  In this yere, dyed quene Eliſabeth of Caſtell wyfe to Ferdinand kyng of Aragone without any yſſue of mā chyld, ſo that the heritage dyd fall to lady Iohan her eldeſt daughter, by Ferdinand whiche after was maried to the Earle of Flaunders, thē made by this mariage alſo chiefe gouernoure ouer all that countree.
                  Shortly after about the .xiii. day of Ianuary which was the yere of our lord. M .ccccc. and fyue thys Earle hauyng a nauye prepared ſayled out of Flaunders with his wyfe to Spayne, but he had not ſet forth longe, ere the wether beganne to chaunge, and tempeſtes to ryſe ſo, that at the laſt fearſenes of the wynde, dyd dryue them to the coaſtes and borders of Englande, wher he landed at an hauē or porte called Wynmouth, ſore againſte the mynd and conſent of all his companie, which knewe well that the ſame landyng ſhould bee the occaſion of long tariyng there. When it was kno
                     
                        •
                     n that he was thus landed, there came agreate nomber of harniſſed men to proue yf he were the kynges frende or no, whiche when thei perſeaued hym to bee his frende, and entended nothing but loue and frendeſhippe, Thomas Trencharde the chiefe of that compaignie went to the kyng, deſyring hym (yf it would witeſalfe) hym to take a lodging at his houſe, whiche was euen nigh at hand truſting therby to haue thāke of. ye kynges maſter whom he certifyed in al the haſte of his commyng
                  
                     
Alſo Iohn Caroe deſired hym that he woulde not gooe vntyll ſuche tyme that he had ſpoken wt the kyng his louing and feithfull frende, conſideringe that he was within two or thre dayes iourney of hym. So that at length although he layde many excuſes to haue been gooen and departed, at their inſtance taried there with theim. And when ye kyng was enfourmed of his cōminge, he reioyced highly and ſente certaine of his nobilitee to bring hym where he was. Wherfore this Erle ſeing no remedy but yt he muſt nedes tary, he went ſtreight to Windeſore where the kyng dyd lye. And ſhortlye after folowed his wife quene Iohan. After they two had cōmoned of many thinges together at the laſte they beganne to treate of a league and perpetuall amitee to bee had.
                  And firſte Kynge Henrye deſired to haue Edmonde Poole baniſhed man vnder his captiuitee and bondage. To whome the Earle aunſwered &amp; ſaied that it was not in his power to reſtore hym, yet after muche entreating and praiyng, the kyng graunted at the laſte that he ſhoulde hee ſente to hym righte ſhortly. After thus for prolonginge of time yt he might haue his deſyre, he brought Philyp the Earle to London, and there ſhewing hym his citie, retourned frome thence with hym.
                  Then Edmonde Poole, ſeyng that there was no more hope to bee had in foren Princes, and truſting that kyng Henry would put hym at libertee came to Englande willingly to proue his gentlenes, that yf vpon this expectacyon and hope, he were deceiued, yet he might at the laſte dye and be buryed in his natiue countree.

weare, when he had receyued this garment, he did ſend Baltheſar Caſtillio a Mantuan borne vnto kyng Henry, whiche receiued of ye knightes a garter, in token yt he ſhould be a knight of the ſame ordre. When this buſines was dooen, Lewes the Frenche kyng miſtruſtyng that he ſhoulde neuer haue manchild, maryed his eldeſt doughter Lady Anne to Frances Valeſe Dolphine Duke of Engoſye, which was ſure a litle before to Charles the kyng of Caſtell. And when kyng Henry knewe of this, he thought beſte to mary his doughter Lady Mary to this Charles kyng of Caſtell which mariage was confirmed and made at Caliſe by ye byſhop of Wincheſter &amp; the ambaſſadours of Flaunders, the Ladye beyng but .x. yeres of age.
                  And now were the thre yeres expired, at whiche tyme kyng Henry thought his fatal daye to draw nyghe. Therfore to the entente that the people myghte wyſhe and praye for hym after his deathe for his kindneſſe that he ſhewed to theim, he cauſed a generall pardon to bee geuen vnto all offendours, 
                        
                           〈…〉
                        all

                        done. ſauinge onely theues and murderers, becauſe that they dyd not offende hym, but another manne. For this goodneſſe ſhewed to the people, proceſſyon was in euerye place of the Realme for the ſafegarde of the kyng.
                  Neuertheleſſe his time was come, ye God would haue hym, ſo that he died the .xxi. daye of Apryll, in his palaice of Richemoūde, the whiche was the yere of oure Lorde a thouſand fyue hundreth and eyght. His corps was buryed at Weſtminſter in a chappell the whiche he cauſed to bee buylded. He reigned thre and twentye yeres, and more then

ſeuē monethes, &amp; liued .lii.

                     eſted there from Thurſdaie till Saterdaie, in the whiche ſeaſon he created certain knightes of the Bathe.
                  And vpon Saturdaie aboute foure of ye clocke at after noone, the kyng came ridyng through cornehill in moſte honourable wiſe, before whom roade theſaid knightes of the Bathe in blewe lōg gounes with hoodes vpō their ſhoulders, ſpreade after the maner of maſters of arte, and taſſelles of white and blewe ſilke faſtened vpon one of their ſhouldres. The duke of Buckyngham̄ roade next before the kyng, except the mayre of London &amp; certain ſergeauntes and herauldes. The whiche

duke roade in a long goune of nedle woorke right coſtly and riche, &amp; bare a litle white ſtaffe of ſiluer in his hand in ſigne and token yt he was high and chief ſteward of ye feaſt of coronacion. And theſaid duke had aboute his necke a broade and flat cloſe chein of a newe deuiſe not before vſed, fret wt precious great rubies and other ſtones of greate value. And ouer the kyng was borne a riche canapie by the foure barones of the foure portes, and there folowed ſeuen foloers, wherof the firſt was trapped in the armes of ſainct Edwarde, the ſecond in the armes of ſainct Edmond, the third in ye armes of. S. George, the fourth in the armes of Englād, the fifth in the armes of Fraūce, the ſixth &amp; the. vii in ſondry trappors of riche cloth of gold wt coſtely deuices.

In whiche progreſſe, paſſed before theim eight and thirty biſhopes &amp; abbottes mitered in proceſſion, and ſo were conueighed to a ſpace betwene ye high aulter and the quere, where, by ye Biſhop of Cauntourbury, the kyng &amp; the quene were

And for the ordre of ye ſettyng, the kyng ſate in the myddle of the table, &amp; the quene vpon his lift hāde by the ſpace of two yardes length from hym. And vpon the right hand, at ye tables ende ſate ye archebiſhop of Caūtourbury alone, &amp; no mo at ye table. After whiche thre eſtates thus ſet, all their .iii. ſeruyces wer brought together till they came vnto ye ſteppes of the deyſe, where a while reſted ye quenes and archebiſhoppes ſeruyces, till ye kyng was ſerued, and then the quenes and tharchbiſhoppes ſet forwarde together, but the quene was firſt ſerued and her ſeruyce ſet downe before the other.
                  Here I wyll paſſe ouer the orderyng of the hall with the offyciers &amp; garnyſhyng of the ſide tables with many noble menne &amp; women, &amp; many other ceremonyes executed there that day by lordes and other hed officers, as the lorde ſtewarde the duke of Buckyngham, the chief buttler the erle of Arū

Al ye which actes with many mo I here paſſe ouer
                  Then vpon the tueſdaye next enſuyng was begonne a merciall iuſtes, within ye paleys of Weſtmynſter. Of ye which ye lord Haward &amp; ſir Edward his brother, wt ſir Richard brother to ye lord Marques &amp; Gyles Capel &amp; two other wer chalēgours. And ſyr Ihū Pechy, Maſter Carre, Maſter Charles Brandō &amp; ſyr Rowland with other. ii, wer defē

Vpō the which day, two of ye chief of ye ſaid chalengers encloſed in a moūtayne goodly &amp; curiouſly garniſhed, wer by a lyon made of glitteryng golde conueighed out of Weſtmynſter hall into ye paleys, &amp; ſo led about the tylt, tyll they came right agaīſt ye kyng &amp; quenes ſtāding. And there ye moū

The which ſone after came in at the gate by the kynges ſtrete, but ſyr Ihon Pechy as chiefe defendour, came encloſed in a caſtell drawen with a lyoneſſe garniſhed with glytteryng ſyluer. And vpō the forpart of this caſtel was ſet a pomegranate tree wel &amp; curiouſly brought, and ſo cunnyngly yt it ſemed to ye people to be very pomegranades that honge on yt tree. And vpon ye toppe of this ſayd caſtell ſtoode a fane, wt the armes of Saynt George theron paynted. The which caſtel was ſo drawen about ye tilt, &amp; whē it came right again ye kynges tent, it was opened by a vyce, &amp; out roade yt ſaid defēdour, &amp; after his obeyſaūce made to the kyng &amp; quene, &amp; in like maner did all his feloes, then he roade vnto yt ende of the tilt nexte the gate wher he entred before, &amp; then ye ſaid ſyr Ihon

Pechy as chief chalengour receaued a ſpeare, as ye lorde Hawarde before had done, &amp; ranne together v. courſſes cōtinually, to ye great prayſe &amp; laude of theim both. And then rāne ye other as thei wer called vpon &amp; aſſigned ſondry tymes by ye kyng, &amp; ſpecially ye kynges highnes cōmaūded maſter Gyles Capel to rōne, howbeit his horſſe yt daye did hī not moſte pleſaūt ſeruice. And thus thei cōtinued their diſporte .iiii. houres, to yt greate cōforte of ye beholders &amp; to yt honour of them al. Howbeit, ye moſt ſperes wer brokē by ye lord Haward &amp; ſyr Ihō Pechy.
                  Then vpon ye thurſday next foloyng, ye ſaid chalengeours &amp; defendours made a goodly diſporte, as firſt ye ſaid chalengeours cōmyng out of Weſtmynſter hal, cauſed to be cōueighed before them a pageaūt like to a foreſt, pitched full of grene boughes, within the which ſate a virgyn appareled after the Spaniſhe guiſe, &amp; ſemblaūtes of buckes &amp; dooes aboute her. And whē the ſaid chalengeours wt their ſaid pageaūt came before the kynges ſtandyng, ſodeynly rāne out of ye ſaid foreſt a pryket, &amp; after him a braſe of grehoūdes, ye which courſſed ye ſaid pricket &amp; there ſhortly after ſlewe it. And after yt a foſter blewe a moote for ye death therof, &amp; ſmote of ye hed quickly &amp; preſented it vnto ye quene. And ye done the ſaid chalēgeours paſſed ouer to thend of the tilt &amp; there houed a while. And then ſhortly after ye trōpettes &amp; many of the ſaid gētlemē wel horſſed &amp; apointed, yt before had cōueighed into ye place the chalēgours, cōueighed in alſo ye defēdours, the which comyng in wt a like pageaūt before thē (except that the maidē in their foreſt was atired after thengliſh faſſiō) &amp; demeaned theim in all thynges

like as before ye chalēgers had done. And whē thei wer come to ye other ende of the tylt, anone was cō
                     maūded yt the turney ſhould begynne, whereupon ſwordes wer brought to either of theim. And then firſt turneyed yt lorde Haward &amp; maſter Pechye a good ſeaſon &amp; after theim yt reſidue two &amp; two tyll either of theim had furnyſhed ye full of .xii. ſtrokes that by ſondry tymes ye fyre ſprange out of the helmettes. And when thei had finiſhed yt fearte of armes, not without many ſore ſtrokes &amp; often departyng by the marſhalles ſeruauntes &amp; ſome of the kynges garde. Thei then wer cōmaūded to ronne together all .xii. &amp; ſo to Turney til either had ſmitten a certē nombre of ſtrokes, but then was peces of harneyſte hewen into the felde, &amp; ſwordes brokē and bowed, ye wonderfull it was &amp; fearefull to beholde. The which cōtinued wt ſuch egerneſſe, that their nōbre of ſtrokes paſſed, &amp; that the power of ye marſhals ſeruaūtes ſuffiſ
                        •
                     d not to depart thē, til ye kynges highnes called to his gard to helpe to diſſeuer theim, whiche was not dooen without great pam, &amp; although ye euerie of theim quite theim ful manfully, yet Charles Brandō yt daye was greatly auaunced &amp; furthered by his horſſe, the whiche yt day faught wt his teth &amp; feete like a ſerpent, &amp; ther vnto was ſo pleaſaunt &amp; light of head, that he had his aduerſarye euer at greate aduauntage, in ſo muche yt he euer ſtrake .iii. ſtrokes before he receaued one. This day alſo was ſhewed diuerſe deuyces of armour, as ſome of white &amp; grene chekered, ſome of blacke paled with gold, ſome al red &amp; ſome all grene. And the harnayes the whiche the ſayde Charles Brandon then turnayed in, was all ouer

gylte frome the heade peece to the ſabattons. And thus with all honoure and worſhyppe to them ſelues &amp; great pleaſur to the beholders, thei brought thys marciall playe and dyſporte to an ende.
                  Shortly after this, was Hempſon and Dudley commytted to the towre, and Dudley was arreigned the .xvii. daye of Iulii, in the Guldehall and there before the Mayre, and other the kynges cō
                     myſſioners, was condempned and iudged to bee drawen, hanged and quartered, and then commaū

In thys yere alſo, was holdē at Weſtminſter the .xxi. daye of Ianuarii a parlyament, wherin was made dyuerſe and ſondrie actes and ſtatutes.
                  In the ſeconde yere of the kynge, and the .xvii. daye of Auguſt was Hempſon &amp; Dudley brought vnto the ſcaffolde vppon the towre hyll, and there were behedded. And the fyrſt daye of Ianuary folowinge, Henry the kynges ſonne was borne. And vpon a wedniſdaye beyng the .xii. daye of Februarii next folowyng was holden atriumphant iuſtes within the palayes of Weſtminſter. Of the which was chefe chalengeoure the kinges maieſtee with iii. other, whoſe names ſhalbe mynded in the ende of thys declaracion.
                  And fyrſt for a conuenyencie of the ſhewyng of thys mooſt excellent feates of armes. Ye ſhall vnvnderſtande

that the kynges grace with the other thre chalengeours encloſed in a mountayn whych was paſſyng connyngly and curiouſly wroughte with rockes, trees and dere, whereof on ether ſyde ſat a foſter clad in graſſe grene ſatin, with eyther a bent bowe in his hande, and abrode arrowe, and a horne aboute eyther of their neckes. And bi the ſydes of eyther of the ſayde foſters, laye certeyn ſpe
                     
                        •
                     es. And in the front of the ſayde mounte betwene the two corner pyllers ſat a fayre vyrgyn, clothed in blewe and lyght tawny ſatin, makyng of a garlande of roſemary and other herbes. Thys pageaunt or mount was drawen vpon wheles by a leoparde all of beaten gold, and an Antlop of beaten flat ſiluer, the which two beaſtes were led with .ii. myghtie and high woodwoſes by two ſtrynges of ſylke, and ſo conueyghed out of Weſtminſter hall about the tylt, vntyll ſuch tyme as the ſame mountayne came ryght agaynſt the quenes tent. About the whiche was attendaunte manye gentilmen on foote cladde in coates of whyte and grene ſatyn.
                  But yf I ſhoulde here reherſe the ſtraunge and coſtly apparell which the fore ryders were clothed in, with theyr ryche trappers and other deuyſes, I ſhoulde here make a long tariynge. Wherefore to procede as I beganne. When thys mount as is a 
                        •
                     oue ſayde was before the quenes tente, eyther of the foſters blewe a moote, and that doone the kynges maieſtie firſt iſſued out of the mount and another with hym at one dore, &amp; at another doore rode out the other two chalengeours, all .iiii. hauyng in their handes eyther of theym a ſmall ſcochion, the whiche thei offered vnto the quenes grace.

and al .iiii. chalengeours had cotes beneth ye waſt of blewe ſylke garniſhed with portcolyes of Veniſe gold without difference, ſauynge the kynges graces coate was of blewe veluet, and the other were of blewe ſatin. And where the kynges away ters were in coates of whyte and grene, the other wer in iackettes of blewe ſatyn. And after the chalengeours had thus offered vp their ſcochiōs and made their obeyſaūce vnto the quene. The kinges grace with ye other roade vnto the ende of the tylt ouer agaynſt Weſtmynſter hall gate, and there houed tyll ye defēdours were brought into ye place
                  Then the foreſayde gentylmen whyche before had brought in the kyng, road for the defendours the whyche anone came in at the weſte gate of the palais in ſondry pageauntes and goodly deuices whyche here I wyll ouerpaſſe, for as much as the daye folowyng they ferre exceded, wherof the declaration wyll aſke a long leyſoure. Wherfore to procede further, when the ſayd defendours accordyng to the lawe of armes had bene conueighed about the tylte, and were come to their ſtandynge nere vnto the weſt ende of ye tylte: Anone the kynges maieſtee called for a ſpeare, and ſo ranne .vi. courſes before he lefte, and brake in thoſe .vi. courſes .iiii. ſpeares as well and as valyantly as any man of armes myght breake theim, &amp; ſuch as wer broken vpon hym, he receaued thē as thoughe he had felt no dynt of anye ſtroke. In ſo muche, that where at ye beginnyng, in ye felde was many a fear full &amp; timerous heart for him, conſideryng his excellencie and his tendernes of age. After thei had ſene the ſayde courſſes ronne and his manfull deliuer

chargynge and diſchargynge, he reioyſed ſo the peoples heartes that a man myght haue ſene a thouſande wepyng iyen for ioye And then ſuche as were in mooſt feare ſawe by his marcial feates that by the ayde of God, he was in no daunger
                  And whē the other chalēgeours had rōne a few courſes, he wēt to it a freſh, &amp; thē ran .x. or xii. courſes inſtātly or he would ceaſſe, &amp; brake many ſpeaces, &amp; gaue ſo many teintes, yt euery man maruay led at his wōderfull feates. For none ye there was chalēgeour or defēdour, might attain to halfe the ꝓweſſe yt he accōpliſhed yt daye, ſo yt the pryce was geuē to him of all mē, aſwell of thē yt were deputed iudges of thoſe feates of armes for yt day, as of al other. And whē he had thus paſſed his time to his great laude &amp; honour, he then at ye requeſt of ſōdry lordes, which yt daye gaue their attendaunce vpō his grace, went into a pauilion whiche nere vnto the tiltes ende at yt tyme was prepared for hym, &amp; there taried while the other chalēgeours ranne a certain courſſes wt ſuch of the defēdours as had not bene aſſaied yt day, the which demeaned theim right valiantly &amp; knightly, &amp; made full marciall diſport. And whē this had cōtinued vpō an houre or more. The king came then out of his pauiliōry dynge vpon a graye courſſer, betrapped wyth a crappoure of clothe of golde, and wroughte wyth goldſmithes woorke, which was litle ouer an hād breadthe, and garnyſſhed in ſondrye places wyth white roſes made of fine gold. And vpon the pai

                     rell of the horſſe breſte, ſtoode a roſe of a greate bredth, and another like vpon the crupper behind Which .ii. roſes as a goldſmith reported that had

ye ouerſight of ye making of ye horſſe harneiſſe, ſaid that theiweied either of thē aboue .l. onces in gold
                  The kynges maieſtee was in a ſtreight coate of moſte rycheſt clothe of golde made cloſe vnto his bodye and ſtreighte ſleues, after the proportion of his armes, and in two or thre places the ſaied ſleues were cut and faſtened together againe with a plunket ryband, thewhiche garment became hym wonderouſly well. And thus beyng apointed with his legge harneys being ſtyll vpon his legges he rode vnto the tyltes ende, and there houed whyle the Herauldes made their monicion and criyng a

                        ſtill, a lhoſtill, and conueyghed the defendours oute at the gate whiche they firſte came in at. And that dooen, the gentlemen firſte ſetting forwarde next vnto the trompettes, and then knightes, barnes, and Lordes as they wer of degrees folowing in their goodly apparelles: laſtly next vnto ye king came the Lord Haward, bearing vpon a tronchion the kynges helmet. After whom the kyng then cōming, tooke vp his horſe in ſo ſemely and luſty maner, that ſhortly to conclude, no man could doo better nor ſytte more cloſe nor faſter, nor yet kepe his ſtiroppes more ſurely. For notwithſtandinge that the horſe was veraye courageous and excellente in leaping and tornyng and excedyngg flinging, he moued no more vpon hym, then if he had helde a plain and ſofte trot. And thus paſſyng the compaſſe of the felde, when he came ouer againſte the quenes Tent, he then beganne of newe, &amp; leaped and courſed the horſe vp and downe in wonderful maner. And finally, he turned the feete of ye horſe againe the tylt, and cauſed hym to fling and

beate the boordes with his fete, ye it redounded aboute the place as it had been ſhotte of gunnes. And when he had thus with all cōmendacion and honoure perfourmed this luſtye and courageous feacte, he turned hym vnto the quene and made a lowlye obeyſaunce, and ſo paſſed in a demure maner into Weſtminſter hall.
                  Vpon the daye nexte foloyng, being thurſdaye and the .xiii. daye of February was holden a more excellent iuſtes, not for the more valiaunt actes yt daye done of armis, but for ye ineſtimable richeſſe and coſtely apparell whiche that daye was worne wherof I entende to touche a parte, for the whole paſſeth my conning and memory. But for a note after the capacite of my dul witte. Aboute the ſeaſon of halfe an houre after one of the clocke, the quenes grace being in her tente. Immediatly iſſued oute of Weſtminſter hall the trompettes, and after theim the Herauldes, the Trompettes being

And ye grene veluet ſyde was fret wt plates of gold of goldſmithes woorke in righte ſumpteous wiſe. And their horſes were garniſhed in one ſute, not withoute clothe of gold and other coſtly deuices.
                  Vpon the ſecond day, or this thurſday, their cotes wer halfe clothe of gold, &amp; thother halfe of purple veluet. The veluet garniſhed wt ſkalop ſhelles and pilgrimes ſtaues of maſſy golde, &amp; their horſe trappours of ye ſame.

For ye lordes, many of theim road in long gounes of cloth of gold exceding riche of ye newe making, wherin is moſte ſubſtaunce of gold and litle ſilke.

Amonge the whiche were ſpecially noted the Lorde of Burgeinie and the Lorde Fizwater, whiche were in one ſuyte of clothe of golde with their trappers lyke, &amp; .ii. large &amp; maſſy bauderikes about their neckes, whiche wer eſtemed at a.

And emonge theim roade alſo ſir Nicholas Vaus in a goune of goldeſmithes woorke to the knees, and therein a furre of ryght browne and fyne ſables of greate value.
                  
                     
Then emong theim that roade nexte to ye kyng came my Lorde Henry of Buckinghm̄ in a goune of nedle werke, which was more coſtly thē ſome of clothe of gold &amp; more alowed for the curioſitee of ye werke therof. And though here I make no memory of the luſtye leaping, bounſyng, mounting and flinging of the iolye and luſty foreryders, no man thynke the contrarye but there was aſwell doyng horſe as any might bee, and aſwell wer they taſted and proued, to the great comforte of many a noble manne and woman that day. Then when all this luſty compaignie was thus paſſed by, Immediatly enſued a pauilion or tente of blewe &amp; purple ſatine paled, and after that two other of ye ſame faſſyon, all thre beyng garniſhed with letters of brodery werke. And laſte of all came in the fourth te

                      made of clothe of golde and purple veluet paled, whereof the panes of veluet were poudered with theſe two letters H. and K, as H. for Henry, and K for kyng, and the ſkirtes of the ſaid pauilion was borne vp rounde aboute with .xxxvi. or .xl. gentlemē, as eſquiers for ye body, all beyng clad in ſhort Iackettes of blewe and purple ſylke, the whiche were conueighed aboute the tylte, tyll they came before the quenes tent. Where euery chalengeour according to their roomes rode oute of their tentes, &amp; after obeiſaunce made vnto the quene, roade vnto the tiltes ende, and there taried the cōminge of the defendours. Howbeit, the kynges highneſſe roade into the pauilyon, where the daye before he chaūged his apparell, and there taried their comming. The whiche ſhortely after were brought in, but or I procede any ferther, I muſt of a conueniency

bring in a matter neceſſary to bee reherced, ye which negligētly I haue ouerpaſſed, and ye is this.
                  When the kynges pauilion was as is aforſaid come out of the hall, immediately folowed theſaid pauilion nyne folowers or henchemen, all clothed in clothe of golde and purple veluet parted, the veluet ſide beyng garniſſhed with theforſaid letters of golde as the pauilion was. Of the whiche folowers, the firſt courſer was trapped with the armes of Englande, the ſecond with the armes of Fraunce, the third with the armes of Caſtell, the fourth with a riche trapper poudered with red roſes and white, the fift with cloth of golde furred wt poudered armines, ye ſixte with cloth of ſiluer and purple veluet parted, the ſeuenth of purple veluet garniſhed wtth maſſy plates of gold, a parte wher of was an arme from the elbowe armed with an hearte of golde whiche was of greate weight and value, thewhiche arme and heart were ſette vpon either ſide of the breſt of the horſſe, and again in ye trapper vpō bothe ſides of the crupper.

After whiche folowers, enſued the yoman of the horſſe vpō a faire double horſſe ledyng in his hande the ſelf ſame horſſe whiche the kyng roade out of the felde vpō, as before I haue reherced, and then as laſt and hynmooſt came rydyng vpō a luſtie courſer ſir Mathew Baker as maſter of the kynges henchemenne, right well and ſadly apoincted and like a manne of good age and ſadnes, &amp; thus repaired through the felde with ſuche

demeanour as before is reherced.
                  Then to retorne vnto the defendoures. Trouth it is that ſir Charles Brandō as firſt came into the felde encloſed in a tower and led by a iaylour holdyng a greate keye in his hande, the whiche pageaunt when it came ouer againſt the quenes ſtandyng, the iaylour with his keye made a countenaunce as though he had opened the gate of the tower, oute of the whiche iſſued a manne on horſebacke clad in a long courſe and priſoners weede, with a pylgrymes long ſtaffe in his hande and a pylgremes hat vpon his heed with a long and forgrowen bearde reachyng to his ſadell bowe. He alſo had hangyng vpon the hooke of his ſtaffe apayre of bedes of gold, and vpon the top of yt ſtaffe was faſ
                        •
                     ened a lettre, the whiche ſtaffe with the bedes and letter were ſent and deliuered vnto the quenes grace, vpon the whiche when ſhe had awhile looked, ſhe ſent ſuche aunſwer that the priſoner caſt from hym haſtely his clothyng, beard and hat, and ſhewed hym ſelf in bright harneys, and ſoorth with ſmote his horſſe with the ſpurres, and made a luſtie pace vnto the tiltes ende, and from thence tooke his courſe and ranne aboute the tilt all moſte luſty wiſe.
                  And after the ſaid Charles was thus come in, there enſued tenne mo of the ſaid chalengeoures, of the whiche if I ſhould wryte all the apparell and circumſtaūce of their cundite vnto their place aſſigned, it would aſke a long tracte of tyme, but ſhortely to procede to the effect of this matter. So ſone as all the defendours were come vnto their place aſſigned. The kynges grace iſſued oute of

his pauilion and called for a ſpere, the whiche whē he had receiued, he ranne and brake right vigorouſly, &amp; ſo ranne ſeuen courſſes more or he would ſtynt, in the whiche at euery courſſe he brake aſpeare or gaue a taynt. And one thyng was greately noted in hym, that at euerie courſſe that he ranne he would neuer charge hym with his ſpeare in the reſt, till he came nere vnto the copyng. Then by exhortaciō of ſuche lordes as were aboute hym he reſted for a ſeaſon. And when the other chalengeours had diſported theim a while with ſuche defendours as the kyng had not before taſted: The kyng then came foorth agayne and ranne many and ſondry courſſes, the whiche he performed to his greate laude and honoure. And albeit that the other chalengeours did full knightely and well and likewiſe the defendours, as the lorde Marques, ſir Charles Brandon and other, yet the feates of the kyng ſo ferre excelled theim that none was ſpoken of but his alone, whiche ſo continued duryng the tyme of their diſporte till foure of the clocke at after none, at whiche ſeaſon, ſo ſone as the defendours wer cōueighed out of the felde, he called for a ſpeare, the whiche he ſettyng vpon his thigh, roade wt his hed pece vpon his head roūde aboute the tylt, and at twoo tymes when he came ouer againſt the quenes ſtādyng, he made as lowe obeyſaunce as his ſadle would licence hym, and ſo roade into his pauilyō &amp; there vnarmed hym. And anone after came out of the ſame pauilion ſittyng vpon the ſame ſpare horſſe whiche the yoman of yt horſſe brought in his hād into ye feld when ye kyng firſt entred. And then he was chaunged into a demy

gowne of clothe of golde furred with ſables, the whiche when thei were ſhewed defaced, ſo theother that ſir Nicholas Vaus ware, that thei ſemed matyrns in compariſon of the other.
                  Then the gentlemenne ſette forward, and after folowed the three chalengours rydyng bare heded, and their three helmettes borne before theim by three lordes, and laſt of all came the kynges grace, whoſe helmet was borne by ye lorde of Burgeyny. And in like maner as his folowers folowed hym into the feelde, ſo in like wiſe thei folowed hym in his gooyng oute, at whiche ſeaſon as then he ſtured his horſſe nothyng, but ſuffered hym to goo a ſofte trot through all the felde. And at the twoo tymes that his grace came before the quene, his grace forgate not his humble obeyſaunce, to the crudicion and learnyng of all well nurtered and gentle wedded menne. And thus wt all honour, ioye and triumphant actes, to the principall laude of this our moſte excellent and chriſten prince, and after to ye worſhip of all the other, aſwell chalengeours as defendoures, and greate comforte of all the beholders, ended theſe moſte excellyng iuſtes that euer was before that daie ſeen in Englande, and that for twoo cauſes ſpecially, as firſt ye preſent deede of the excellencie of the kynges perſonne, whiche neuer before that daie as I thynke was ſeen in propre perſonne. And ſecondarely for the excedyng coſte of apparell whiche theſe twoo daies was ſhewed, with other manifolde charges of pageauntes and other ſumpteous thynges, the whiche by wiſe mennes eſtimations coſte not ſo litle by the ſpace of theſe two dayes

                     i. Whiche two marciall dayes were accomplyſhed by the actes of theſe foure chalengeours, ye is to ſaye: The moſte redoubted prince Henry the eyght of that name, kyng of Englande Fraunce &amp; Irelād. &amp;c. Syr Thomas Kneuet, lord Wyllyā of Deuonſhire, and maſter Edward Neuell. And of the defendours there were .x. in nombre, whoſe names came not al into my handes and therfore haue I omytted theim.
                  After theſe royall iuſtes, was made a ſolempne and ſumpteous banket, the order of whiche I ouerpaſſe becauſe it would bee to long to reherce.
                  The .xxiii. daye of Februarij nexte foloyng dyed at Richemounte Henrye the kynges ſoonne which was borne there, vpon newe yeres day laſt paſt as before is ſhortelye touched.
                  In the thirde yere of his reigne, aboute the monethes The .iii. yere. of Iune and Iulij, the Scottes made ſondrie entres vpon the borders of England, and had out certain ſhippes wel manned and vitayled and kepte with theim the narowe ſees, to the great diſpleaſure of the kynges grace and hurte of ſome of his ſubiectes, ſpecially of his merchauntes, the whiche rouers were named to be bannyſhed men. But the kynges highnes, conſyderyng the daylye hurte that thei did vnto his ſubiectes and frendes as takyng of vitaile at Sandwich &amp; other places vpō the ſee coaſtes, and that no remedye was purueyed by the kyng of Scottes to call theim home. His grace in all goodly haſte manned and vitayled certain ſhippes, and vnder the gouernaunce of the lorde Hawarde as hed and chief capitain ſente the ſaide ſhippes to ſcoure the ſee, the whiche in

ſhorte proceſſe after aboute thende of Iulij mette with the ſaide Scottes, and gaue vnto theim a ſharpe and fearce fight, in ſo much that in thende thenglyſhe menne drowned one of the Scottiſhe ſhippes, and tooke two of the chiefeſt ſhippes of that 
                        •
                     lote, and in theim one hundreth and fourtie Scottes with their hedde capitayne named Hob of Barton. The whiche Scottes with theyr ſayd capitayne were caſte into ſondrye pryſonnes, and as the fame wente, in the foreſayde fighte was ſlayne as many of the ſaide Scottes as were taken pryſoners, and of thenglyſhe menne fewe or none. And vpon the ſeconde daye of Auguſt wer ye forſayde two Scottiſhe ſhippes brought vnto the blacke walle within Thamys. But afterward the ſaide Scottes were by the kynges commaundement brought vnto tharchbyſhoppes palays beſyde Weſtmynſter, and there kepte at the kynges coſte.
                  Aboute this ſeaſon or lytle before, the Frenche kyng that had moſte parte of this yere kept warre again Iulius the ſecound of that name byſhop of Rome, forced theſaid biſhop to forſake the cytie of Bonony, &amp; to fle for his ſafegarde toward Rome, not withoute loſſe of ſome of his people. This biſhoppe had deputed one Iherome Bonuiſe a Lukener borne, and before tyme had bene a merchaūt and factoure for merchauntes of his nacion in London, the whiche by his inſolencie and exercyſyng of dice wyth lordes and other, he brake and came ſo behynde the hande that he was compelled to aduoyde the citie &amp; alſo the realme. In the tyme of whiche abſence he purchaſed ſuche grace of the

fornamed biſhop yt he made hym a lorde, &amp; after ſent hym into this lāde as his proctour, hauyng a trayne after hym lyke vnto a byſhop: &amp; by the 
                        •
                     auourable letters whyche the byſhoppe wrote for hym vnto the kyng, his grace had hym in good fauoure, and dayly reſorted vnto his grace for mattiers touchyng the biſhoppe, by meane wherof he had knowledge of the biſhops councell and alſo of the kynges.
                  In this tyme alſo were here certeyne ambaſſadours of the Frenche kynges, the whiche lay here a long ceaſon for matters concernyng their prince to whom this forenamed Iherome, ſecretly drewe by nyght tyme, and innaturally and falſely dyſcouered vnto theim all the byſhoppes, and kynges councell. For the whiche he was awaited and laſtly takē in the companie of one of the ſayd Ambaſſadours vpon Londō wall about mydnyght, and ſo brought vnto the counter of the pultrye, frome whence by the kynges cōmaundement on the morowe he was remoued vnto the Towre, where he remayned ſtyll as a pryſoner.
                  In this time alſo was wonderfull warre betwene the byſhop of Rome Iulius the ſeconde of that name, and the French kyng, in ſo muche that he wanne from the ſayd B. the citee of Bonony, &amp; put the B. to flight, &amp; layed ſuch articles agayne hym yt he entēded to put him downe &amp; make another biſhop, ye circūſtaunce wherof I paſſe ouer, cō
                     ſyderyng ye manyfolde tales and writynges ſente vnto the merchaūt ſtraungers of theſame, in the which letters were variable and diuerſe reportes.
                  In the later ende of this yere, the Scottes before

taken by the knyghtly prowes of the lord Hawarde and ſyr Edward his brother were delyuered fre and franke, to whome the kyng of his boū

But theſaide ſir Thomas Kneuet with many other gentlemen of this land and alſo of fraunce were brent, on whoſe ſoules Ieſu haue mereyt.
