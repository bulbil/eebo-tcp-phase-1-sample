            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               IVdicious Doctors and profeſsors of the famous and laudable ſcience of Phiſicke (in token of the ineſtimable loue &amp; good will I beare to this worthy faculty) I haue vnto you (as the chiefe patrons thereof,) committed this little Glaſſe of ſick men: wherein you may beholde the ſtate and condition of the diſeaſed perſon (ſoe truely and infallibly, as the Arte of Aſtrologie can certifie) being aſwel correſpondent and agreeable to the ſayings of auncient and approoued Authors, as by experience and dayly obſeruations verified, whereof I my ſelfe haue made ſufficient triall (as many of my familiar friendes and aſſociates can teſtifie) inſomuch that hee which compareth theſe documents with the iudicials of vrine, ſhall thereby not onely decerne and perceiue the true cauſe of the diſeaſe, but alſo the augmentation, relaxation, continuance and alteration thereof to good or euill (both to the praiſe and eſtimation of the arte, &amp;

alſo the credit &amp; profit of the expert Phyſition) aſſuring you that heerein is nothing written, but onely that which hath been taken out of the groundes of Aſtrologie, and agreeable to the ſentences of the moſte excellenteſt Phyſitions. And although peraduenture this methode and manner of iudgement dooth ſeeme hard and difficile to ſome men at the firſt aparance, yet let no mā be diſcouraged, for with a little reading and peruſing, it wil ſoone appeare both plaine &amp; eaſie, which being once obtained, the commoditie therof will bee verie delectable and profitable. And ſo to conclude, if this my labour be acceptable to your learned eares, it will encourage me (to endeauour to the vtermoſt of my power) both to examplefie this introduction, and alſo to ſupply you with another treatiſe which ſhall fully and largely detect and lay open this manner of Iudicials: ſo in the meane time I commit you (and your induſtrious actions) to the protection of the Almightie.

                  LEauing thee diuers and ſundrie opinions of many Authors (with their miſtaken axiomes and vnaprooued ſayings) as well as the raſh boldeneſſe and preſumptuous iudgements of thoſe ignorant perſons which eyther by the day of the month, the age of the Moone, or Plannet, then raygning, onely doe giue iudgement on the life or death of a ſicke perſon, or of the manner of his diſeaſe: which by their erronious opinions haue brought this famous arte into ſuch and ſo greate contempt, that of the moſte part of men, it is ſuppoſed to be rather a recreatiue inuention, then any true and vnfained aſſcertion. I haue (Gentle Reader) by the helpe of thoſe two excellent Aſtonomers, Ptholomeus and Hermes, nouriſhed and brought vp this prole or iſſue, which although it be yet young, naked, weake, and tender, yet I hope in conſequence of time (when it is come to ripeneſse of age, well cloathed and to his full ſtrength) that it will be able to ſtop the mouth of this hidious monſter ignorance, which with his violent ſting and venemous biting, ſeeketh vtterly to deſtroy ſcience and learning, according to the old prouerbe ſcientia non habet inimicum niſi ignoranciam: So committing this little one into thy fauorable protection, I hope thou wilt rather charitably, foſter it in the lappe of pittie: then tyranically and cruelly to deſtroy it in his infancie.
            
            
               Yours to the vttermoſt of his power.

            Of the ſignificator of the ſicke body.
            
               IT hath beene an order and a cuſtome (amongſt the moſt excellenteſt and wiſeſt Phyſitions) to chooſe the Moone for the principall ſignificatrix of the ſicke perſon, and according vnto her motion, ſcituation, and configuration (with other Plannets) haue giuen iudgment on the increaſing, mittigation, and alteration of the diſeaſe.
            For Hippocrates (in principio Prognoſticorum) ſpeaketh of the Moone, and ſayth in this manner. There is a certaine Starre of heauen on which a Phiſition muſt take heed and mark, the purueiance thereof is wonderfull and dreadfull. Alſo Galen (in commento de diebus criticis) ſaith: a Phiſition muſt take heed &amp; aduiſe himſelfe of a certaine thing that fayleth not, neither deceiueth, (which the Aſtronomers of Aegipt taught) that is to ſay, when the body of the Moone is ioyned with fortunate ſtarres, dreadful and fearfull ſickneſſe commeth to good end. Likewiſe Aſtronomers ſay, that among all the other plannets the Moone (in ruling) hath moſt power and maiſtry of mens bodies: for as Ptolomeus ſaith (in Libro de iudicijs Aſtrorum) vnder the Moon is contained, ſicknes, loſſe, feare, harme, and domage: therfore about the alteration of mans body, the Moone worketh moſt principally: and not with out good cauſe, for as Aſtronomers affirme, ſhe hath dominion and goernment of all liquid &amp; moiſt ſubſtances, as the water, oyle, &amp; ſappe of trées, &amp;c, As the thrice learned Clark Doctor Dee, in the 103. Apkoriſme of his Booke intituled Libro de quibuſdā naturae virtutibus ſaith thus Luna potentiſſima eſt humidarum rerum moderatrix, humidatiſ

                   excicatrix &amp; effectrix. So we may no leſſe aſſure our ſelues that ſhe hath ſuperiority and predomination on the fours humors, Choler, Blood, Fleame and Melancholy, which in ſubſtance are nought elſe but humedious and vaporatiue, although they differ in quality

Then as Phyſitions doe hold the opinion that all the infirmities which naturally happen to any perſon (and not by any miſchance orſodaine accident) doth proceede and come by the diſtemperance of thoſe foure Humors; ſo we may very well conclude, that if the ſuperficies or head of a Fountaine, doth alter his accuſtomarie courſe of running, then the adiacienticall or belonging ſtreames muſt needs differ either in quality or in quantity. So likewiſe the Moone being paſiua qualitatis collecteth and retaineth the good or euill influence of that plannet to whome ſhe is adioyned or applyeth: as Hermes ſaith (in his Iatromethematikes) Luna vero ſtellae (ſine benifica ſiue malifica fuerit) vtri ſe applicuerit, illi ſuffragabiter.

               The vſe of this Table.
               
                  FOr euerie ſigne and degree the Moone is in, there is 16. columbes in the table (caractered with their proper figures of Algoriſme, with theſe letters S. and D. ſignifying ſignes &amp; degrees) in which the mortall, iudiciall and criticall daies, doth happen in: being noted at the head of the Table thus: Mort: Daies, Iudic: daies &amp; Critic: daies. The vſe of this Table is thus: The day and howre knowne in which the ſicke perſon tooke his Bed, you muſt ſearch the ſigne and the degrée the Moone is in (which being found) entring into the Table (in the vttermoſte columbe on the left hand) intituled the partie falling ſicke, (vnder the carracter of Luna) you ſhall finde againſt the ſigne and degree the Moone is in, all the Critical, Iudiciall, and Mortall daies in their proper Columbes (noted at the head of the Table) during the ſpace of time, the Moone paſſeth through the whole Zodiack or ſignifier, to which aforeſaid places, when ſhe cōmeth (during the continuance of ye ſicknes) then ſhall be the true Criticall, Iudicial and Mortal daies, as you ſhall ſee them ſuperſcribed at the head of the Columbe.
               
                  An example.
                  The firſt day of May 1605. Acertaine man ſickned and tooke his bed, at 6. of the clock in the afternoone, the Moone being then in the 12. degr. of Piſces, now I deſire to know the Critical, Iudiciall and Mortal daies (of that perſon) then entring into the Table in the vttermoſt columbe on the left hand, vnder the caracter of the moone in Piſces, ouer againſt the 12. deg. in the nextcolumbe, I find the 7. degree of Aries, to which when the Moone commeth is a mortall day: &amp; in the third columbe, I finde the 27. degree of Aries, to which part of the Zodiacke when the Moone commeth, is a Iudiciall day In the fourth columbe, I finde the 22. degree of Taurus, which is a mortall time, and in the fift columbe, I finde the 12. of Gemini, to

which place when the Moone commeth, that is a Criticall day, &amp; ſo of the reſt vntill the Moone hath perambulated through the whole Zodiack, &amp; if the diſeaſes ceaſe not in ye meane while, after you haue gone through the 16. Columbes, you muſt begin againe as you did before: Note that the time the perſon taketh his bed, is the firſt criticall time.
               
            
            
               Of the Aſpects of the Moone with the Planets.
               IF you deſire to know with what Planets the Moone is configurated or adioyned, you muſt learne what day and houre the ſicke body firſt tooke his bed, or lay downe by meanes of the rage of the diſeaſe: except the ſickneſſe came to him at that time, when he was already in his bed for then you ſhall obſerue the time in which the diſeaſe began to torment him: which being exactly knowne, you muſt calculate the motion of the Moone for the time the perſon fell ſicke, conſidering that ſhe is ioyned and applyeth vnto a Plannet, two manner of wayes, that is to ſay either corporally, or by the aſpect of the Semidiameters of their bodyes called applycation.
               Corporall Coniunction is when the Moone is in the ſame ſigne and degrée another Planet is, but the Moone is ſaid to be radiationally ioyned to a Planet, when her body toucheth his Semidiameter.
               Likewiſe the Moone is aſpected and beheld of a Plannet two manner of wayes.
               The one is called a perfect aſpect as when there is 60 degrées betwéene the centure of the Moone and another Plannet, that is ſayd to be a true Sextile aſpect.
               Or when the body of the Moone is diſtant from another Plannet 90. degrées, is called a perfect Quartile aſpect.
               Or when the Moone is elonged iuſt 120 degrées from another Plannet, the Moone is ſaid to beholde that Plannet, with a 
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  Trine aſpect. And if the centure of the moone be diſtant 180 
                     〈◊〉
                   from ye body of another Plannet, yt is named a perfect Oppoſition.
               The other is an vnperfect aſpect called applycation, as when a Plannet is certeine degrées different from a true aſpect, onely 
                     〈◊〉
                   in the Semidiameter of his body.
               
                  
                     
                        The Semidiameter or halfe the beames of
                        ♄ ♃ ♂ ☉ ♀ ☿ ☽
                        
                        Degrées.
                     
                     
                        9. 9 8. 15. 8. 7. 12.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
So that Saturne and Iupiter extend their forces but to 9. degrées Mars vnto 8. Sol vnto 15. Venus and Mercury almoſte vnto 8. Luna vnto 12. for if the bodie of the Moone or her aſpect commeth within the Semidiameter of any Plannet, ſhee taketh or receiueth the influence of that Plannet (good or euill) to whome ſhe is ſo ioyned or applyeth.
               
                  Example.
                  Suppoſe the Moone be in the fourth degree of Aquarius, and Saturne, in the 11. degree of the ſaid ſigne, then ſhould the Moone apply to Saturne, for as much as her bodie is within the Semidiameter of his beames. Or if the moone were in the 10. degree of Taurus and Mars, in the 16. degree of Leo, then ſhee ſhould behold Mars with a Quartile aſpect.
                  But if the Moone were in the 20. degree of Capricornus and Saturne in the 8. degree of Libra, then ſhould the Moone be free from the Quartile of Saturne, for becauſe his maliciouſneſſe extendeth no farther then the ſemidiameter of his beames (which is but 9. degr.) and their diſtance from a true aſpect is 12. degr. yet notwithſtanding the ill fortunes doth afflict the ſick perſon, when they adioyne or aſpect the beames of the Moone, with their Semidiameter (but not intercidentically) for the farther the Moone is from their coniunction or aſpect, the leſſe they torment the diſeaſed: and contrarily the fortunes (Iupiter and Venus) the nearer their bodies or Aſpect approacheth to the moone, the more they intermeddle their vertues, and the ſooner mittigateth the ſicke mans paines.
                  Note that of the Aſpectes the Quartile and Oppoſition are haiefull and maleuolous Aſpects, eſpecially the Oppoſition.
                  
                  And the Sextile and Trine aſpects are fauourable and friendly aſpects, chiefly the Trine.
                  
                  The Conjunction is variable, for it is very good with good Planets, and extreame euill with ill.
                  Alſo ſometimes it ſhall be neceſſarie to know the latitude of the Planets.
               
            
            
               To know whether the ſicke perſon ſhall liue or die.
               IF the moone (at the day and houre the ſicke tooke firſt his bed,) bee free from the Coniunction, Quartile, or Oppoſition aſpect of Saturne and Mars, the diſeaſed perſon ſhal not depart by meanes of

that ſickneſſe (eſpeciallye if Iupiter or Venus regarde the Moone with Coniunction, Sextile, or Trine aſpects) for then the ſicke ſhall ſoone recouer his health, and ſo much the rather if the Moone be free from combuſtion, and augmenting in light and motion. Alſo the head of the Dragon is of the nature of ye fortunes (Iupiter &amp; Venus) but not ſo effectuall in operation.
               But contrarywiſe, if the Moone be afflicted eyther by the Coniunction, Quartile or Oppoſition of ye ill fortunes (Saturne &amp; Mars) the ſicke ſhal die, chiefly if Iupiter or Venus doe not aſſiſt the moone, or if ſhe be combuſt and decreaſing in light and motion.
               Alſo the Dragons taile is of the nature of the ill fortunes, but of himſelfe hath not the interficient force of Saturne or Mars, for as much as it is a line and not a Starre.
               Likewiſe if the moone be in the via combuſta, which is from the middeſt of Libra vntill the middeſt of Scorpio, or vnder the Sunne beames and decreaſing in light or motion, and applying to Saturne and Mars, eyther by coniunction or any aſpect (chiefly by Quartile or Oppoſition aſpect, although their ſemidiameters onely beholde the ſemibeames of the moone) it threatneth death.
               
                  An example.
                  A certaine man fell ſicke and tooke his bed, the mooone beeing three degrees in Scorpio (decreaſing in light and motion) Mars 13. degrees in Libra, and Saturne 27. degrees in Sagitarius, and departed when the moone came to the 13. degres of Capricornus.
                  
               
            
            
               To know the times in which the ſicke perſon ſhall feele eaſe of his paine, or recouer his health.
               HAuing found by the Doctrine aforeſaid, that the ſicke perſon ſhall not departe, then as often as the moone méeteth with

                  An example.
                  
                     Anno Dom. 1605. the 28. of May (about 7. of the

And when the Moone came to the 19. deg. of Piſces (meeting the Oppoſition of furious Mars) he had a great and mighty fitte of ſickneſſe, almoſt abſolutely depriuing ſence and motion. Alſo he was ſorely tormented when the Moone came to the 24. degree of Piſces, becauſe ſhe then beheld Saturne with a ſpitefull Quartile aſpect, after that he began to amend, foraſmuch as that was a mortall day, and Iupiter enuironed the Moone with a friendly Sextile aſpect.
               
            
            
               To knowe when and what time the ſicke Perſon ſhall depart and be grieuouſly tormented.
               NOW if you finde by the afliction of the Moone at the time the partie fell ſicke, that he ſhall dye, then on the next mortall day that the Moone meeteth with eyther of the ill fortunes Saturne or Mars, by coniunctiō, Quartile, or Oppoſition (applying to thē either corporally or radiationally) the ſick ſhall dye at that day &amp; hours in which ſhe commeth to the interficient point of the Zodiake: which agreeth to the ſaying of Ptholomeus in the 16. Aphoriſme of his Centiloquiums wherein he ſaith we muſt behold the motion of ye Moone as ſhe paſſeth through the Criticall, Iudiciall, and Mortall daies, for if ſhe be in them fortunate, it will fall out well: vnfortunate, the contrarie.
               
                  An example.
                  The 17. day of May (Anno Dom. 1605.) A man fell ſicke about a 
                        〈◊〉
                     . of the clocke at night, the Moone being then in the 2. degree of Libra, Sol in the 6. degree of Gemini, Saturne in the 24. deg. of Sagitarius, Iupiter in the 27. degree of Capricornus, Mars in the 10. degree of Gemini, and Venus in the 22. degree of Taurus: Now I 
                        〈◊〉
                      the Moone aflicted by the hatefull Quartile aſpect of Saturne,
                     
being ſcituated within the maleuolous beames of the ſemidiameter of froward Saturne, wherby I iudge that the ſicke ſhall depa
                        •
                     t: then entring into the Table of Criticall. Iudiciall and Mortall dayes, I finde the firſt mortall day to bee when the Moone commeth to the 27. deg. of the ſaid ſigne of Libra, yet for aſmuch as that degree is free from the oppreſſion of the ill fortunes, I affirme that the ſicke ſhall not dye at that time the Moone commeth to the ſaid ſigne and degree: Therfore I ſeeke the next dying day, which is when the moone commeth to the 12. degree of Sagitarius, which being aflicted by the Oppoſition of Mars, collocated in the 14. degree of Gemini, I iudge he ſhall dye when the Moone commeth to the 12. degrée of Sagitarius: and ſo he did.
                  Note that during the time and permanence of the ſickneſſe, as often as the Moone meeteth the bodies or ill aſpects of the diſtroyers of nature, ſo often the diſeaſed perſon ſhal feele and ſuſtaine very ſore panges.
                  Furthermore, ſome Aſtronomers affirme, that as long as the Moone decreaſeth in motion, ſo long the griefe ſhal aggrauate, and waxe greater and greater.
                  But Hyppocrates (in Libro de Iudicijs infirmitat: ſecundum lunam) ſaith thus, when the ſick perſon taketh his bed you muſt conſider whether the moone departeth out of combuſtion, for then the ſickneſſe ſhall increaſe vntil Luna commeth to Oppoſition, by reaſon that humors increaſe in mens bodies: and if ſhee be then with good Plannets, it falleth out well: with euill, the contrarie.
               
            
            
               Of the cauſe of the diſeaſe.
               TO knowe the cauſe of the diſeaſe, you muſt looke with what Plannet the moone is configurated or adioyned eyther by coniunction or aſpect, and according to the nature and influence of that planet, iudge the diſeaſe that afflicted the moone.
               The coniuction or any aſpect of the ill fortunes doth afflict the Moone, and the Quartile, and Oppoſition of Sol and Mercury. Now if Sa
                        ••
                     rne or Mercury oppreſſe the Moone, the diſeaſe ſhalbe ſlowe and ſlacke, with laſſitude and heauineſſe of the limbes: inſomuch that the ſicke ſhall ſcarce bee able to ſtirre his bodie, and the diſeaſe ſhall ſhew it ſelfe by little and little, by coldnes of the bodie,

with defluction, debillitie, and obſtruction: cauſing the ſicke to awake out of his ſleepe ſodainly or by ſtarts. &amp;c.
               The ſicke perſon (alſo as Hermes ſaith) ſhall be ſollitarie, ſilent, and fearefull, deſiring heate, warme cloathes, and darkneſſe, with often ſighing, and continual oſcitation and yawning: the whole ſuperficies of the body will be colde and dry, and the pulſes little and ſlow. The cure of ſuch, is by thinges that diſolue and binde.
               But if the Moone (at that time the perſon fell ſicke) bée afflicted by Mars or the Sunne, all the ſuperficies and vpper parts of the body ſhall be in extreame heat as if they were incenſed and kindled with fire. The party ſhall bée very prone and apt to anger, crying-out with ſcritches and fearce lookes, ſometimes inordinately with rauing and franticke fits: as when choller rauiſheth vp into the head, perturbating the braine with violent heat &amp;c.
               Alſo they are very dry &amp; thirſty, deſiring colde drinke, with ſpitting and aridity &amp; drines of the tongue, with loſſe of appetite, and deſire of meate: continually ſaporing and taſting with the tongue: The viſage and face as red as fire, and all the body loaden with ſuperfluity; the pulſes are little, preſſed downe and inordinate. Bloodletting vntill the fift day, and ſuch things as are refrigeratiue, repercuſſiue, and auoid ſuperfluity, are medicinable to the ſicke perſō.
               Likewiſe Hermes ſaith, that they in whoſe decumbiture the moon was afflicted, of Sol or Mars, ſhall féele loathſomneſſe in the mouth and ſtomacke, with paine in the heart, veines and artires. But continuall-Feauers, Pluriſies, Exulceration, and inflamation of the Lungs, take their originall of Saturne and Mercury, afflicting the Moone in fierie ſignes.
               The fortunes (Saturne and Venus) in my opinion do neuer vexe and torment the ſicke body, although they beholde the Moone with hatefull aſpects, or at the leaſt wiſe, neuer in ſuch ſorte that they cauſe the ſicke to take his bed: for ſéeing that they are adi
                     •
                  tors and reſtorers of nature, it is vnlikely that they ſhould become enemies &amp; deſtroyers thereof, although ſometimes by accidents (as by hatefull aſpect) their friendſhip and familiaritie is refrained.
            
            
               
               Of the effects that the Moone operateth and worketh in euerie ſigne when ſhee is afflicted by the ill fortunes.
               
                  
                     ☽. in ♈. of ♄. oppreſſed.
                  
                  WHoſoeuer taketh his bed, the moone being in the ſigne of Aries (chiefly decreaſing in light and motion) and applying to Saturne or Mars (eſpecially by Coniunction, Quartile or Oppoſition) the diſeaſe ſhall take his originall and beginning of a colde cauſe, with heauines of the head, and debillation and weakeneſſe of the eyes, with diſtillation and falling downe of humors into the breaſt, by meanes of a rumeticke head, &amp; ſtuffing of the throate and pipes with fleame and catarre: The vehemency &amp; rage of the griefe ſhall chiefly extend it ſelfe by night, all the intrailes and inward parts ſhall be exceeding hot, but the ſuperficies and extreame par
                        •
                     es ſhall ſhiner with colde, with languiſhing and ſounding, and loſſe of appetite, and ſweating in the dead of the night: the Pulſes are weak and inordinate. Thinges that heate, mollifie, and loſe the belly, doe cepreſſe the cauſe of the griefe, but bloud letting is vnprofitable.
                  And if the moone applie to none of the fortunes, but is within the Semediameter of the bodie of Saturne or Mars, or their ill aſpectes, then on the next mortall day, in which the moone méeteth with Saturne or Mars, the ſicke ſhall departe: but if the moone be not within the beames of Saturne and Mars, nor their malicious aſpects (eſpecially increaſing in light and motion, and applying to Iupiter or Venus) then on the next time that Luna meeteth with Iupiter or Venus (vpon a criticall day, &amp;c.) The ſickneſſe ſhall abate, or at leaſt wiſe, turne out of one diſeaſe into another. But if Mars likewiſe ob
                        •

The ſicke perſon ſhall haue continuall and pernicious burning Feauers, with obſtructions and ſtopping of the veines. The pulſes ſhall be high, and inordinate.
                  Blood letting is conuenient to the ſicke bodie. And if the Moone be configurated to none of the fortunes, but applyeth alſo to Saturne (eyther by Coniunction, or hatefull aſpect.) the ſicke perſon ſhall not eſcape, but at the next mortall day that Luna commeth within the dangerous confines of frowing Saturne, the ſicke ſhall yeelde himſelfe a priſoner and captiue to pale death.
                  Contrarily if the moone be free from the ſemidiameters of the ill fortunes (eſpecially aſſiſted with the fortunes, and augmenting in light and motion) then on ye next meeting of the Moon with Iupiter or Venus (vpon a mortall day, &amp;c.) the diſeaſed body ſhall féele eaſe.

                     SAturne afflicting the moone in Cancer (at the lying downe of any ſicke and diſeaſed Perſon) denoteth the griefe to come of much bathing in colde water, or of a conceite, or vehement colde, or by late drinking, or fitting long at ſtuddy, or ſuch like: The ſicke perſon ſhall be vexed with the Cough, Catarre and horſenes, and diſtillation and falling downe of humors into the breaſt: with obſtructions and oppilation of the Pipes, with Feauers, ſtrict and inordinate: the pulſes are lowe and little.
                  And if the moone be decreaſing in light and motion, and placically adioyned to Saturne, the ſicke ſhall die (chiefly if none of the fortunes aſſiſt the moone with their fauourable beames.)
                  But if the moone be elonged from the beames of Saturne (eſpecially increaſing in light and motion) and fortunately aſpected of Iupiter or Venus, then on the next meeting of the moone with the fortunes vpon a Iudicall day &amp;c.) nature ſhall preuaile againſt the euill humors.
               
               
                  
                  The Moone in ♋ of ♂ afflicted.
                  HE that is debride or taketh his bed, the Moone being in the ſigne of Cancer, malefacted by the euill influence of Mars, ſhall haue a diſeaſe proceeding of blood or ſweet fleame, with euerſion and tourning of the ventricle. Things that refrigerate and coole expelles the griefe.
                  And if none of the fortunes intermeddle their friendly beames, ye diſeaſed party ſhall hardly eſcape, eſpecially if the Moone be combuſt, or decreaſing in light and motion.
                  But if ſhe be adiuted and holpen by the fortunes, then at the next obuiation of Luna with the reſtorers of nature Iupiter or Venus (vpon any of the alteration dayes) the rage &amp; fury of Mars ſhall b

                  The Moone in ♌ of ♄ oppreſſed.
                  IN whoſe decumbiture &amp; lying downe the Moone poſſeſſed the celeſtiall ſigne of Leo (and therin afflicted of Saturne) the grieſe ſhall proceed of blood: the ſicke perſon ſhall be grieued about all ye breaſt with heate and intenſion of the heart ſtringes, with augmenting Feauers: The pulſes are troubled &amp; out of courſe, with great heate and feruentnes both inwards and outwards. Things that heate &amp; mittigate, are very good and commodious to the ſicke body.
                  And if Mars alſo oppreſſe the Moone, or if ſhe be not ſuccored vnder the winges of the fortunes, then (on the next mortall day, that the Moon meeteth with the venomous beames of the deſtroyers of nature) the ſicke ſhall dye: chiefly if the Moone be combuſt, or deminiſhing in light and motion.
                  But if Iupiter or Venus regard the Moone either corporally or raditionally, eſpecially ſhe being free from the Sunne beames, and augmenting in light and motion, for then nature ſhall get the victory of the rebellous humors, &amp; on the next ambulation of the Moone with the fortunes (on a criticall day) the ſicke ſhall amend.
               
               
                  The Moone in ♌. of ♂. afflicted.
                  THE Moone being in Leo (oppreſſed by Mars) the griefe ſhall proceed of ſuperaboundance of blood, cauſing vnſtable and vncertaine Feauers, with languiſhing, and ſounding, and loſſe of appetite: heauineſſe of the body, with drowſineſſe and dead

ſleepe vnerpugnable, with extenuation and conſuming of the whole bodie: weakeneſſe, with diuers paſſions and affectes of the hart. Things that are refrigeratiue &amp; abſtringent are medicinable.

                     one applie to the fortunes (chiefly free from combuſſion, increaſing in light, and ſwift in motion) the ſicke ſhall not departe: yet the griefe ſhall bee dangerous by reaſon of the violent heating and aduſtion of the blood.
                  But if the Moone be paſt the Oppoſition and ioyned to the euill beames of Mars diminiſhing in light and motion: then (vppon the next interficient day that the Moone meeteth with the bodies or ill aſpects of Saturne or Mars) the diſeaſed perſon wil be forced to yéeld and ſurrender his ſpirit.
               
               
                  The Moone in ♍. of ♄. oppreſſed.
                  IF the Moone be in Virgo afflicted by the Coniunction or aſpect of Saturne (at the time the ſicke tooke his bed) the griefe ſhall procéed of cruditie and indigeſtion in the ſtomacke, with ache of the bowels and intrailes, proceeding of tough and viſcuous fleame, ſometimes with head-ache and pricking vnder the ribbes, Feauers, ſtrict and inordinate. Things which callifie, mollifie, and diſſolue, are curable to the griefe.
                  And if the fortunes aſpect the Moone (eſpecially ſhe being increaſing in light and motion, and free from the ſunne beames) then the ſicke perſon ſhal not depart: yet he wil be long ſick, by the meanes of the crudde humors which will be long before they are fully ouercome.
                  But if none of the fortunes beholde the moone, then there is no hope of life, but at the next meeting with the moone and the ill fortunes (on a Mortall day) nature ſhall bee vtterly endamaged and ouercome.
               
               
                  The Moone in ♍. of ♂. afflicted.
                  THe moone in Virgo (afflicted by the malicinus beames of outragious Mars) the ſickneſſe ſhall proceed of ſharpe and fretting humours, with fluxe of the wombe, and exulceration of the bowels, with ſmall and vuſtable Feauers: The pulſes are flowe and thick, with euerſion of the ventricle, &amp; the ſtomacke abhorring &amp; loathing of meate. Things yt repreſſe the diſeaſe, are ſuch as are obſtructiue, and expell ſharpe fretting humors.
                  
                     
And if the ſeueritie and cruelty of Mars be not emulgated and abated (either by the cōiunction, application, or cōfiguratiō of Iupiter or Venus) the ſicke ſhall not eſcape: chiefly the Moone being combuſt, and decreaſing in light and motion.
                  But if the Moone apply to none of the fortunes he ſhall dye (on the next mortall day) to the fortunes the contrary.
               
               
                  The Moone in ♎ of ♄ oppreſſed.
                  AT whoſe decumbiture the Moone was collocated in the ſigne of Libra (and oppreſſed by the body or aſpect of Saturne.) The grief ſhal come of the ingurgitation or inordinate ſwilling of wine, and ſtrong drinke, with nocturnall and nightly aſſault and conflict, paine and griefe of the head and breaſt, diſtillations, cough, &amp; hoarſnes: The breaſt greened of laſſitude, the ſtomack diſdaining meate, ſmall Feauers comming by night with a double acceſſe. He ſhall be continually tormented and afflicted, with remiſſion and ſlacknes of the pulſes. Thinges that callifie and heate are very profitable.
                  And if the Moone apply to none of the fortunes neither by Conjunction nor aſpect, then the ſicke ſhall dye: eſpecially if the Moone be combuſt, or decreaſing in light and motion.
                  But if Mars alſo afflict the Moone, then the griefe ſhall not turne out of one diſeaſe into an other, but at the next congreſſion with Saturne or Mars (on an intercidenticall day) the ſicke perſon ſhall dy.
               
               
                  The Moone in ♎ of ♂ afflicted.
                  
                     MARS oppreſſing the moone in the ſigne of Libra, will prouoke a diſeaſe proceeding of blood; whereof will growe intenſed Feauers, with vigillation and waking, and inflamation of the whole body. The reamidy in curing of ſuch perſons, is by letting of blood, and the vſage of ſuch thinges as are dormitable.
                  And if none of the fortunes regard the Moone (ſo afflicted) the diſeaſed perſon will be conſtrayned to giue place to death.
                  But if the mallice of Mars refrayned (by the influence of Iupiter or Venus) the ſicke ſhall not depart: but at the next congreſſe of the Moone with Saturne or Mars (vpon a iudiciall day &amp;c.) the diſeaſed perſon ſhall be reſtored to his priſtiue ſtrength.

                  FVrthermore the Moone being in Scorpio of Saturne indamaged (by the euill influence of his poyſoned corps) The diſeaſe ſhall happen by the meanes of exulceration, or of the euil called bubo in the ſecrete parts, viz. in anno aut pudenda &amp;c. And if the Moone increaſe in light and motion, (eſpecially adiuted by Iupiter or Venus) then the ſickneſſe ſhalbe ouercome.
                  But if none of the fortunes beholde the Moone neither by Conjunction nor Aſpect (chiefly deminiſhing in light and motion) then on the next mortall congreſſion of Luna with the deſtroyers of nature, dryrie death ſhall attainte the afflicted corpes of his ſilly captiue.

                  THE Moone in Scorpio at the lying downe of the ſicke perſon (oppreſſed by Mars) the diſeaſe ſhall proceed of ſome feruent or hot impoſtumation or exulceration, the Pockes, Meaſels, and Hemerods, Peſtilence, Illiacie, and ſuch like.
                  And if the Moone apply to no fortunate plannet, (but is corporally or raditionally adioyned to an ill plannet) then on the next meeting of Luna with the deſtroyers of nature (on a mortall day) the grieued perſon ſhall depart.
                  But if the moone be ſwift in motion and departing out of combuſtion (fortunatly affected of Iupiter or Venus) the party ſhall be deliuered at the next mortall congreſſion of the Moone &amp; the fortunes.

The remedy of thoſe is by thinges that mittigate, aſwage and heate.
                  And if none of ye fortunes behold ye moone wt their amiable beams, but is adioyned or applyeth to Saturne or Mars, (either by Cōjunction or aſp

configuration of the Moone with the ill fortunes, the ſicke ſhall depart.

                  It the moone applie to Saturne eyther by Coniunction, Quartile, or Oppoſition, then the griefe ſhall be vncurable.
                  But if the Moone be elonged 10. degrees, or more from the hatefull beames of Saturne and Mars, or applying to Iupiter or Venus (eſpecially aumenting in light and motion) the ſicke ſhall bee diſeaſed vntill the next Criticall &amp;c. obuiation of the moone and the fortunes, and then he ſhall be deliuered.

                  And if the Moone be within the ſemidiameter of Mars, or meeteth alſo the beames of Saturne (at that inſtant) then the partie ſhall not eſcape, but at the next obuiation of the Moone and the ill fortunes (on an interficient day) the ſicke ſhall dye.

                  WHen Saturne oppreſſeth the Moone in Aquary (at the lying downe of any ſicke perſon) the diſeaſe ſhall proceed of much watch, laſſitude, wearineſſe, or violent labour and exerciſe: The griefe ſhall infeſt him vnequally, with remiſſion, and intenſton, vntill the moone come to her Oppoſition, and then he ſhall releeue (chiefly) if the fortunes intermedle their fauourable beames.

                  Note heere that the Moone apply to any of the diſtroyers of nature in what ſigne ſoeuer ſhe be, either by coniunction, application, or any aſpect: although it be only by the vniting and adioyning of their ſemidiameters, yet it will worke the like operation in diſeaſed

perſons: but not ſo grieuouſly nor mortally, as the Coniunction, Quartile, or Oppoſition. For if the ill fortunes behold the Moone (with Sextile, or Trine aſpects) the diſeaſe ſhall not be lethall: neither alſo in vnperfect applications, Quartile, or Oppoſition: whereas ſhe is elonged, and ſeparated from their beams (eſpecially if the moone be augmenting in light and motion) and aided by the beames of the fortunes.
                  Alſo according to ſome mens opinions, it profiteth much the diſeaſed perſon, if the fortunes or good ſtarres are ſcituated in the Meridian or Horizon (at the decombiture or lying downe of the ſicke body) and ſo contrary wiſe it hindreth the grieued perſon, if the ill fortunes occupy the ſaid places.

                  BLood is a Humour perfectly concoct, the chiefeſt nouriſher and preſerner of our humaine nature, and is hote and moiſte like the aire, and increaſeth in Spring time, from the tenth of March, to the 24. of April, and hath dominion from the ninth houre of the night, vntill

                  MElancholie is a Humour vnperfectly concect, and is called the dregs or ſediment of the other Humours, and is cold and dry like the Earth: But my opinion is, that pure Melancholie is a groſſe and thicke blood, and is blacke of colour by reaſon of the craſſitude and thicknes, which happeneth by meanes of indigeſtion and want of naturall heate to extenuate it, and turne it into pure blood, ſo that Melancholie naturall differeth from blood, chiefly by means of colones, which congealeth and maketh it drier and thicker then b

               And thus much of the temperature and qualitie of the foure Humours, not corrupted or altered, by the medling of one with the other.
            
            
               How the foure Humours are diſtributed in mens bodyes.
               THe foure Humours are proportioned and diſtributed in mens bodyes two manner of wayes: (that is to wit) totally, and particularly:
               Totall or generall diſtribution, is when one of them only hath the predomination and ſuperioritie, as he in whoſe body choller ſoly excéedeth, is called Cholericke &amp;c.
               But particularly they are diſtributed after 12. ſundry wayes, as followeth:
               In ſome mens bodyes▪ Choller only excéedeth the other Humors, and that man I call Chollericke.
               And in ſome, Choller hath che principall dominion, and Melancholy excéedeth the other Humours, and ſuch a perſon I call cholleticke Melancholy.
               But in ſome men, Melancholy hath the ſoueraigntie, and Choller hath ſome dominion, and thoſe I call Melancholly chollericke.
               In ſome, Melancholy ſoly excéeds, &amp; ſuch perſens I terme Melanchollicke.
               In other, Melancholy hath the ſuperioritie, and blood-ſome dominion, and they I call melanchol
                     •
                  ike Sanguine.
               In other, blood ſurmounteth, and melancholy hath the next dominion, and ſuch perſons I nominate ſanguine Melancholike.
               And in other, Blood only raigneth, and ſuch I call Sanguine.
               But in other, Blood excéedes and Fleame hath perticipation with it, and thoſe I call Sanguine flegmaticke.
               Alſo in ſome, Fleame ſurpaſſeth, and Blood hath ſome dominion, ſuch I call flegmaticke Sanguine.
               In other ſome, Fleame onely hath the preheminence, and ſuch I call Flegmaticke.
               And in other ſome, Fleame hath maſtery, and choller ſome domination: ſuch perſons I call Flegmaticke cholericke.
               Alſo in ſone mens bodyes, Choller hath the principall ſoueraigntie,

and Fleame ſomewhat excéedeth the reſt, and ſuch I call cholericke Flegmaticke.
               Hereat the ignorant perchaunce will finde ſome matter to ſpurne, becauſe I haue deuided the complexions of men into ſo many ſundry proportions: yet he that is acquainted with the ſecret operations of nature &amp; knoweth the original cauſe of a mans complections and alſo obſerueth the diuerſitie of mens colours, the ſundry proportions of their bodies, and variety of conditions: ſhall plainly perceiue, that nature hath many wayes diſtributed them, and not onely by foure manner of proportions, as I will herefollowing declare at large.
            
            
               Of the originall cauſe of mens Complexions.
               THe complexion of man procéedeth not of any naturall procreation receiued from his parents at the time of his conception, nor of the milke of the mother or Nurſe, wherewith the Infant is nouriſhed (as ſome doe imagine) But is infuſed and proportioned according to the Celeſtiall bodyes, renolting ouer our Horizon at the natiuitie of the Infant: for that Signe or Signes, which is colocated in the aſcendant or Horroſcope, will certeinly demonſtrate and ſhew of what complexion the natiue is: for if you finde in the firſt houſe a fierie ſigne only ſcituated, you ſhall iudge that perſon to be chollericke of Complexion.
               But if you finde in the Horroſcop the moſt part of a fierie ſigne, and ſome of a earthy, then you ſhall call that perſon chollericke melancholicke, of complexion.
               And if the latter or leaſt part of a fierie ſigne poſſeſſe the aſcendant, with the more part of an earthy, you may call that perſon melancholicke chollerick.
               Alſo if an earthy Signe occupy the whole Horroſcope, that man ſhall be melancholicke.
               Or if you finde in the firſt Houſe the moſt part of a earthy Signe and ſome of an airie, that perſon ſhall be melancholike ſanguine.
               But if the leſſer part of an earthy Signe and the more of an airie poſſeſſe the aſcendant, that man ſhall be ſanguine melancholick.
               Likewiſe if you finde an airie ſigne occupying the whole aſcendant, you ſhall call that man Sanguine of complexion.

                  MElancholicke cholericke men are tall of ſtature, by reaſon that naturall heate is féeble, and thereby are many fumoſities engendred, but yet they are little and ſlender of body, becauſe of drineſſe, therefore their ſkinne is rough and hard, and cold in toucking: they haue but very little haire on their bodies, &amp; are long without beards, by meanes of colde which ſtoppe the poores, and ſuffereth not the matter whereof haire is engendred to come foorth: alſo they haue much ſuperfluitie in the noſe: their colour is pale, ſhadowed with a little nigritude or darkneſſe. As concerning their conditions; they are gentle, giuen to ſobrietie, ſolitarie, ſtudious, doubtfull, auarous, ſhamefaſt, timerous, ſtubborne, fretfull, penfiue, conſtant, and true in action, with a déepe ſurmiſe, and wit ſlowe, with obliniouſnes, their haire is browne and thin, their digeſtion féeble and leſſe then their appetite, the Pulſe litle and ſlacke, their Vrine ſubcitrine and thinne, and their egeſtion is fallow and ſomething ſoft, with dreaming of falling downe from high places, fearefull dreams and ſundry vanities.

Their colour is duſkiſh and ſwarftiſh pale, their ſkinne is rough, and cold in féeling, they haue very little or no haire on their bodyes, and are long without beards, yea ſometimes beardleſſe: the colour of their

                  MElancholicke Sanguine men are higher of ſtature then Melancholicke, for in them naturall heat is temperate, wherefore fumoſities and radicall moiſture is meanly engendered, wherby they are meanly bigge, fleſhie, and firme of body: their colour is after a darkiſh red, their ſkinne neither hard nor rough but temperate in heat and ſoftneſſe, and not very hairie, they haue beardes about 21. yéeres of their age: As touching their conditions, they are more liberall, bolder, merier, leſſe ſlubborne, and not ſo cowarddiſh ſolitarie, and penſiue, as melancholike perſons, neither ſo vexed with euil imaginatiōs as they are: alſo they are gentle, ſober, patient, truſtie, mercifull, and affable: and to conclude, foraſmuch as this complection is temperate in qualitie, ſo likewiſe it is boone in conditions; for vertue is a meane betwéene to extreames: Their vrine is light ſaffroniſh coloured, and meane in ſubſtance, their pulſes are temperate in motion, and their order reddiſh and looſe, with dreames pleaſant, and many times reſpondent to trueth, their digeſtion is meanly ſtrong.

               The opperation that eating, drinking, reſt and exerciſe worketh in euery Complexion.
               MVch eating &amp; drinking in cholerick perſons (if not excéedingly out of meaſure) doth no harme, but rather conſerueth ye good eſtate of the bodie, for of much faſting &amp; abſtinēce commeth great detriment to thoſe perſons, for it debilateth nature, cōſumeth ye body, engendreth chollericke matter, and ſendeth vp ſower and vnſauory vapours into the mouth, and bréedeth aduſtion of humors (eſpecially little eating of meates apt and eaſie to digeſt) for if a Chollericke man will preſerue his body in health, let him eat a meane quantitie of meats hard to defie, and a good deale of meates that are ſoone digeſted. Alſo moderate drinking of ſmall drinke doth much profite, for it cooleth violent heat which inflameth &amp; burneth, &amp; engendereth natural moiſture which will humect the ayred and dryed parts by the rage of choller.
               But much drinking of ſtrong drinke, and hot wines are vtterly to be eſchewed, for they inflame the liuer, and ingender burning

               THe Collericke melancholicke man may well obſerue a meane meaſure in eating and drinking, eſchewing meates hard to digeſt, for ſuch engender tough fleame in their bodies.

               Moderate exerciſe is very conuenient to ſuch perſons.

               Moderate exerciſe is very ſalubrious to ſuch perſons, for it helpeth digeſtion and expelleth phantaſies and imaginations, and refreſheth the ſpirituall members.
               SAnguine melancholicke men are of a ſtronger conſtitution then Melancholicke, and may eate meſurably of meate light of digeſtion, and drinke indifferently of ſtrong drinke: but exceſſe (chiefly of meates indigeſtiue and ſmall drinke) doth fill the bodie with fleame and ventoſitie, and engendreth thicke and blacke blood.
               Moderate exerciſe conſolidateth their bodies, putifieth their blood and clarifieth their ſkin: and the like is to bee vnderſtood in Melancholicke Sanguine perſons.
               SAnguine men néed not be very ſcripulous in their diet, ſo that they excéede not two much out of meaſure: for in them the digeſtiue vertue is moſt robuſt and ſtronge, perfectly concocting the meate and drinke: ſuch perſons may eate meaſurably of meats hard to defie, &amp; a good quantity of me

                  ts which are ſoone digeſted.
               Alſo they may drinke a good quantity of ſmale drinke, but erceſſe engendereth clammie and ſwéet fleame, which oppilateth the poores and conduits of the body, and ingendeteth Feauers, the cholicke and ſtone, and forments of the backe.
               The inordinate vſage of ſtrong drinkes and hot wines doth inflame the blood, &amp; bréedeth hot rumes, Saint Anthonies fire, ſquimſies, Pluriſies, Kings euill, Apoſtuinations in the Liuer, and red Pimples in the face.
               Likewiſe violent exerciſe is to be eſchewed, for it enflameth the Liuer, chafeth the blood, and engendreth the Yellow Ianders, ouerflowings of the Galle, and Ephemer feauers.
               IN Sanguine fleginaticke men, digeſtion is meanely ſtrong, and they may eate and drinke well of meats and drinks of good temperature and apt to digeſtion: But much ingurgitation of meats

and drinkes ingendereth thinne and watery blood, the ſmall Poxe, Exulcerations, cholicke &amp;c.
               Let them drinke meaſurably of drinkes meanely ſtrong, but exceſſe of ſmall drinke, maketh the colour the whiter, and their bodies the groſſer, and filleth the breaſt with ſuperfluitie, and e

               The exceſſe vſage of ſtronge drinke, doth worke the like effect as in Sanguine men but not altogether ſo violently: moderate exerciſe is very profitable.
               THe man in whoſe body fleame hath the ſuperioritie, and blood hath ſome dominion ouer the reſt of the Humours, let him kéep a ſlender diet, and beware of the repleation: for much eating and drinking in ſuch perſons maketh the ſkin tawnie, with rawneſſe in the ſtomacke, and repleateth the body with citrine and yellow choller, and ſower fleame, and engendereth the Meaſels, dulleth the wit, &amp; abateth courage: let ſuch vſe hote wines and ſtrong drinkes in ſmall quantity, for exceſſe drinking is to be eſchewed; for it maketh the ſkin greeniſh or tawnie, and engendreth dropſies, Goutes, Pockes, and fleame, greene choler, &amp; vnſauonry fumes in the mouth. Let them vſe exerciſe, for it clenſeth their bodies of ſuperfluities.
               FLegmaticke men of all other ought to vſe a very ſmall and ſlender dyet, for the vſage of abſtinence and faſting helpeth the digeſtiue vertue, and clenſeth the body of groſſe and vnconcocted Humours:
               But contrarily, much eating and drinking quencheth naturall heate, hindereth digeſtion, and repleateth the body wi

               But let them avoide exceſſe of drinking for that engendreth Quotidians, the Dropſie called Lencoflemna, Falling ſickneſſe, Goutes, Greene ſickneſſe, Rumes, Catarres and ſuch diſeaſes as are bred of indigeſtion. Much exerciſe alſo is very ſalubrious to

                  eth them by ſwet and other euacuations, quickneth the memorie, ſtirreth vp courage, and clarifieth the ſkin.
               FLegmaticke cholericke men are of a ſtronger nature then Flegmaticke perſons, (for in them the vertue of digeſtion is quicker) and may obſerue a meane order of dyet, but exceſſe filleth their bodies with yellow choller, &amp; ſuch diſeaſes as procéed thereof.
               Alſo much exceſſe of drinking engendreth corrupt matter, Morbus gallicus, Fiſtula, &amp;c.

            OMightie Ioue to thee be praiſe, that rules &amp; raignes on hie,
            Thy Majeſtie extolled is aboue the Starry skie.
            Thou that the heauēs &amp; earth of confuſde Chaos made
            The Sonne and Moone and twinckling Starres,
            Bright day and nightley ſhade,
            Who can expreſſe thy wonderous workes, thy wiſdome, power and might:
            No Saint nor Angell can doe it, much leſſe a mortall Wight.
            Thou that from wiſe and pregnant wittes, thy Arcanes doeſt conceale:
            And vnto Babes and ſimple men, thy ſecrets doeſt reueale:
            Let Cherubin and Seraphin, laudate thy name alwaies:
            And hilles and dales, reſound a voice to eccho foorth thy praiſe
            Alſo let man and beaſt likewiſe, thy worthy actes admire:
            And euery liuing thing on earth, thy condigne praiſe aſpire.
            Thou canſt the dead to life reujue, &amp; to the blinde giue ſight:
            And eke bring out of Stigian vale, ſo forcely is thy might.
            For why the life of euery thing, is in thy hand O Lord.
            And maiſt doe with it what thou wilt, if that thou ſay the word
            Thou that the Sun for certaine daies, didſt cauſe to ſtay &amp; ſtand
            Vntill thy people Iſrael, had got the vpper hand,
            Canſt bridle frowning Saturns rage, &amp; bloody Mars withhold
            and bring the Sicke to perfect health what euer Stars foreto
                  •
               de.
            For thou alone art onely he, that all things doeſt reſpect:
            And ruleſt fate and future haps, for loue of thine elect.
            Vnto the Father vncreat, and Ieſus Chriſt his Sonne:
            And vnto God the holy Ghoſt, all laud and praiſe be done.
