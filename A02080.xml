            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

                  THere dwelled in the
Citie of Rome being metropolitane
of the worlde, famous
as well for martiall
Champions, as delicate for
beautiful Ladyes; a Consul
called Flaminius, made glorious

                  •
               e Lawrell wreath, giuen as a Palme to such as haue
béene happie for manie great victories. This consull famous
in the common wealth for his martiall exploytes,
Fortune whose conceit rests in extréemes, either too prodigal
in her fauors, or preiudicial in her frownes, to make
this man the myracle of her deitie, lent him one onelie
Daughter of such excellent exquisite perfection as Nature
in her seemed to wonder at her owne workes. Hir haire
was like the shine of Apollo, when shaking his glorious
tresses he makes the world beauteous with his brightnes.
The Iuorie of hir face ouer dasht with a vermilion
die, séemed like the blush that lept frō 
               Endemions chéekes
when Cynthia courts him on the hilles of Latmos. So did
the proportion of her bodie answere to the perfection of
the minde and the honour of hir thoughtes so fitted to the
glory of hir fauors, as it rested doubtfull whether hir outward
beauties or inward vertues helde the supremacie.

In so much that as men flocke to Delphos to heare the
Oracles of Apollo, so diuers resort to Rome to take veiw
of the excellencie of Terentia: who once delighted with the
sight of hir graces set downe this as an Axiome, that Pallas
the Patronesse of Troy for wisedome: or Venus the
wonder of Heauen for beautie, might not disgrace the dignities
of this gorgious Damosell. Rome swelling with
the pride of this matchlesse Uirgin, whose thoughts were
more humble then hir face beautifull: and yet the Painters
of that time feared to attempt hir portraiture, as finding
the perfection of nature to excéede the proportion of
Art, made hir the Mistresse of their vestals, as one that
counted fancie as vn
                  •
               it for a maide, as Alexauder cowardize
for a souldier. Cupid sitting on his mothers knée by
the fount of Alcydalion, séeing howe Terentia enemie to
his amarous Philosophie, set loue at so light estéeme, and
for a charme against his magicall inchauntments, carried
the euerburning fire of Vesta in hir breast, clasping his
mother wantonly about y• necke he began thus to prattle.
Séeing mother we haue left the places of our accustomed
residēce, to auoid y• troups of such sutors as onely end their
loues with their liues, &amp; haue st
                  •
               ln to this secret foūt here
a while to be solitarie to weare away the time with some
conceited chat, I pray you tell me whereof are womens
hearts made? I aske the question mother for that I finde
the distinction of their fa
                  •
               cies like the difference of their
faces, which as they be distinguisht in proportion, so they
be altogether vnlike in properties. Venus hearing hir son
make such a waggish demaunde, beganne thus to reply.
Some say my boy of the liuer of a Camelion, whose nature
is to bee changeable in hues, and women as variable in
their thoughts. Others of a Pyrit stone, which handled
softly is as colde as ice, but pressed betwéene the fingers
burneth like fire: they which inser this comparison, say
that women brooke not fauourable perswasions, nor may
be woone by intreaties, but the readie way to kindle them

to Desire is to crosse them with Disdaine. Some say their
hearts are of Marble which being hard yet drops tears against
euery storme: Some of waxe that is soft, admiting
euery impression, those women haue their loues in their
lookes, which taken in with a gase is thrust out with a
winke: Some of Adamant, they be hard hearted, and yet
men say the Lapidaries haue tooles to pierce them: Others
of golde, and they be like Danae that will admit no
louer but such as Iupiter. To be briefe my boy, so many
fancies so many fictions, euery one censuring of womens
hearts as his owne experience hath found hir froward or
fauorable. Cupid hearing his mother discourse thus cunningly
demanded amongest all these, whereof was Terentias
heart of Rome formed: At this Venus fetching a déepe
sigh prosecuted hir former premisses thus. Well wag for
all you play the wanton, hast thou insight so far into thine
enemies thoughts that thou hast coted in thy tables the
resolution of Terentia, whom men count more beautifull
then my selfe, and more chast then Diana? Hir heart
my boy is framed of the purest Diamond, which as it is
hard to enterteine loue, so it is cleane, fit for the receit of
vertue: I tell thée Cupid Terentia makes Desire hir
drudge, and Disdaine hir Champion: Shée honors all the
Gods but thée, and admits all recreations but loue: Shée
armeth hir youth with Contempt of passions, that shée
may finish hir age with Content of patience: The prime
of hir yeares are graue that the fruits of hir time may be
gracious, and shée striues to be as full of honor in hir life,
as full of fauours in hir lookes. To conclude my boy shée
is Terentia, who séekes with labors to auoid loues, &amp; indeuours
to be called as vertuous, as other Ladies amarous.
Thus Venus ended with a frowne and Cupid began with
a smyle, she scorning at hir honors he studying on reuenge.
after a little pause y• choloricke boy burst foorth into these
tearmes: And shall Terentia offer perfumes to Vesta and
Hemblocke to Venus, shall shee mother strawe Dianaes
               
Lawnes with Roses and your Pallaces with Nettles?
shall shee set Desire in ragges and Disdaine in silkes? No,
Cupid hath his boults fethered with the winges of swallowes
that flie swift, and his arrowes headed with strong
tempered stéele that pierce déepe, like to Achilles launce,
that did wound &amp; heale, my shaftes mother are of sundrie
mettels, the strongest of them all wil I aime at Terentia,
and if my fortune fayle me not I will change hir songes
to sighes and hir chast prayers to amorous passions. And
with that leaping from his mothers lappe hee bent his
bowe shott an arrowe and hit Terentia on the heart, but

the rest yong Lentulus a Romaine Caualier, vnder
whose conduct the consull sent manie legions to make
warre against the Parthians, was one of those infortunate
men that Cupid had brused with his arrowes. For hauing

               s. In the day his heade was troubled
with thoughts of Terentia: in the night conceit presented

the visiōs of Terentia. Where before he laid plots how to
circumuent the Parthians, now he deuised how to compasse
his passions: Loue wisht him to make light estéem of war,
but growing to be carelesse, he gaue his enemies occasion
of incouragemēt. Being thus perplexed with vnacquainted
fits, he began thus souldier like to debate with himself.
Haue not the auncient Romaines whose statues and trophées
hath filled the world with wonder of their Chiualry
made the ende of their honours to consist in armes? haue
they not fetcht Fame from the heauēs with their swords,
and bounde hir to their fortunes with circumscriptions of
bloud: haue not their launces pierst obliuion to the heart,
and their martiall déeds registred their names in the Cronicles
of memorie? and yet Lentulus dost thou make light
estéeme of war, whose very frownes are honor, and whose
fauors immortall glories? Blush at thy thoughts that are
so base, &amp; wéepe with Caesar that thou hast not done wonders
with Alexander. Thou art elected by the Consuls as
a choise man of Rome, as high prised for thy valour, as thy
parentage, and yet thy mother was of the great Aemilij:
thou art sent against the Parthians, a Nation warrelicke
and resolute, either to challenge thy graue with thy sword
or carue out their tombes with thy Courtelax. Darest
thou then Lentulus amidst those glorious thoughts of a
souldier admit the least passion of a louer? shall thy pollicies
too little for the Parthians, be imployed in purchasing
Terentia? No Lentulus draw thy Fauchion, brandish it against
Rome, and if Loue looke but ouer the walls menace
hir with thy Martiall weapons: and yet Lentulus be not
so stoicall as to reiect such a mightie Deitie. Haue not the
Romaines erected a Temple néere vnto Campus Martius?
Are not Knights dubbed to defēd Ladies? Make they not
their Helmes proude with their Mistresse fauours? Mars
hath his amours as he hath his armours: Alexander gloried
in his loues as he triumpht in his victories? Great
Pompey hath his Iulia, Caesar his Paramour, Souldiers

haue loued, and so will I. Hauing thus discoursed with
himselfe, the hope of his loues draue such an inuincible
courage into his minde that he past not many daies without
giuing battaile to the Parthians, in which getting a
glorious victorie, he sent great treasure and many Captiues
home to Rome, with great intercession to the Senate
that he might not winter from his owne Countrie.
The Consuls gald to fauour him with any reasonable
graunt, sent Lepidus to take his place, and recalled Lentulus
home to the Citie: The fame of whose high intended
thoughts, his conquest inlarged with infinite treasures &amp;
rich Captiues, made Rome to ring with ecchoes of his
matchlesse excellency: Insomuch that passing through the
stréets to the Capitol, there to be inuested with the honors
due to his victories, multitudes of Romanes were placed
on Scaffoldes to take view of so braue and hardie a Captaine,
and the gorgeous windowes of the Citie were stuffed
with troupes of beautiful Ladies tickled with an earnest
desire to satisfie their sightes with his Personage.
Passing thus in pompe, Iulius Caesar then being Dictator
after the solemne rites &amp; magnificent triumphs were ended
bad him home to dinner, where hee feasted him with
such royaltie as might beséeme the greatnes of the day
and the highnes of his owne thoughts. Thus flewe the
fame of Lentulus through Rome as the wonder of this
time, but all those triumphant dignities coulde not extirpate
the melancholy of this Romans thoughts inserted into
his minde by the fond inchantments of loue, but as the
wounded Deare wringeth forth teares, and the Mirtle
pierced yeeldeth Gumme, so Lentulus after this déepe impression
of loue, coulde afforde nought but sighes and sorrowes.
The Iemme of Terentias excellencie reflected
in his minde like an obiect in a Christall myrrour that amiddest
his most serious affaires hée founde the passions
of loue to be intermedled. Fortune that had tied hir fauours
in the toppe of his Crest halfe perswaded to become

constant to this warlicke Champion séeing Cupid wrong
                  •
               
him without cause thought with a souereign Antidote to
preuēt y• further ensuing preiudices of fancy: forcing therfore
oportunitie to dance attendance vpō this hir darling,
it fell out y• 
               Flaminius, the father of Terentia séeing howe
Lentulus was generally feasted of al y• senators in Rome,
thought amongst ye rest, to welcome home y• warrior with
a bāket, &amp; therfore méeting him at one Titus Annius Milos
house, he solemnely inuited him home to dinner. Lentulus
as ful of curtesie as courage, after great thanks, promised
to be his guest, whereupon Flaminius passing home made
prouisiō, &amp; Lentulus stealing to his lodging being solitary,
conceiued such inward ioy at this swéete oportunitie, that
leaning vpon his left hand smiling to himself, he breathed
out these words: viz. Such I sée well as Mars honours
with fauours Venus will not crosse with frownes: those
that conquer in warres shall not perish in loues. Cupid
fauours his fathers followers, &amp; such as Fortune smiles
on in ba
                  •
               tail, shée laughs on in fancies. I coueted to beare
charge against the Parthians, and the Senate elected me
Lord of their Legions: Desire wisht me to haue a sight of
Terentia, and hir father interteines me for a guest: I made
conquest of mine enemies with the sword, and why may
I not win my loue with my loyaltie: Feare not Lentulus,
these concluded comparisons are prodigious, bee Augur
then to thy selfe, and calculate thy good fortunes by thy
thoughts: Loues and warres craues courage. Feare not
man, for thy intreaties are as mightie as hir denials can
be contrarie. As thus he was debating with himselfe the
Clocke tolde him it was time to goe visite his Host, so
that he made himselfe as sumptuous as might be, and at
the parting from his Chamber-dore hée saide thus. If
Venus (quoth hee) thou fauour mee in my loues, I
will become thy vowed seruant in my life: I will strewe
thy Altars with Roses, and set thée vp shrines at Paphos:
I wil binde vp my temples with myrtle bowes, and

for the Martiall garland weare a wreath of flowers. I
wil haue Doues nests in my Pallaces, and what belongs
to thée, shall be some of my delight, onely grace me with
the fauour of Terentia. Ending this his vowe hee pased
forward with his traine towards the house of Flaminius,
where beeing ariued the graue Senator intertained him
with such magnificence, as Lentulus perceiued his welcome
by his honours. The board couered and the company
readie to sit, Lentulus was placed chiefe at the table, who
all this while hauing no sight of Terentia, sat as a man
nipped on the heade, although there were at the table to
grace the feast manie braue &amp; beautifull Damosels. Sitting
thus in a dumpe he was cheared vp by all the companie,
but at last to set him in his iolitie, Terentia was commanded
by hir father to bring him in a cuppe of Gréekish
wine. Shée that little cared to be séene in open bankets as
holding it contrarie to the rites of Vesta, durst not yet but
with all diligence signifie hir obedience. Therfore attyred
in a rich roabe of white, spotted with starres of gold; tempering
the porphury of hir face with a vermilion blush, looking
like Diana when shée basht at Acteons presence, shée
came into the hall, where humbly saluting all the companie,
shée deliuered the wine to hir father. Lentulus séeing
Fame had but blemisht hir fauours in being to partiall of
hir praises, sate so amased at the beauteous excellencie of
Terentia, as did the Centaure enamoured of Iuno. His eie
made suruey of hir beauties who posting them ouer to the
contemplation of his thoughts, so set on fire his heart with
hir perfections, as his stomacke shut vp hir Orifice, to giue
his eies leaue to wonder at the serious conceit of natures
cunning: his lookes beganne to sparkle loue as did those of
Adon when he pried vpon the face of his Paramour, the
change of his colour bewraied his newe entertained passions
which noted by Terentia half angry at loues folly, she
discouered hir collor with such ablush as Lentulus letting
fall his knyfe on his trencher saide aloude, Non fortuna

non Bellum meaning that neither the highest state of
fortune nor the fatall intent of warre could conquere that
hart y• her beautie hath made subiect. Terentia at this vnexpected
exclamation abashed and the rest of the companie
maruelled: but Flaminius willing to moue some table
talke demaunded of Lentulus what hee ment by this soudaine
embleme. Lentulus, willing to make flight at the
foule and yet not to haue a bel at his héele, answered thus.
Whilst I lay in legar intrenching the Parthians more
hardly with legions of men then with déepe raised contermures,
my souldiers discouered a castle which once woone
displaced the strength of the countrie, séeing the Romanes
had made mee Uicegerente of their forces although the
place séemed impregnable béeing as well defended by nature
situate vpon a mount, as by prowesse stored with
men and munitiō yet prising honor more déere then bloud,
and countries profite beyonde the content of life, I bent
certaine legions against the castle and following the opinion
of Quintus Fabius Maximus sought by delay to driue
them to composition. For it was said of him,

                  Vnus homo nobis cunctando restituit rem,
                  Non ponebat enim rumores ante salutem,
                  Ergo post
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      magis
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      viri nunc gloria claret.
               
            
            Séeking so to get conquest by famine which would haue
béen preiudiciall with the sword, at last séeing their forces
greatly weakened I gaue assault and entred putting the
souldiers to the sword yet willing to saue the Lorde of the
castle for that his valour discouered his thoughtes, searching
him out I found him in his bed chamber his wife
slaine and the blade yet varnished with bloud grasped in
his fist staring me in the face with a gastly looke, that stood
amazed at the stratageme he spake thus. Romain report
in the Senate house that where you excell vs in pollicie,

we excéede you in resolution, this Ladie which thou séest
here weltring in hir goore is my wife, and for she brokes
not seconde fancies, shee craued to ende hir loue with hir
life: I maried hir a virgine and honourable, shee dies a
wife and honest, as famous in Parthia for hir vertues, as
your Romayne Dames for their braue
                  •
               ies. Wee liued
without iarres, for y• the desire of the one was the content
of the other, constancie banished ielousie and true loue
helde supition at the launces poynt. Our fortunes Romayne
thou hast pulde downe, with thy prowesse warre
hath made wracke of our safeties, but for our loues this
sword shall linke them together by death, so that Non fortuna,
non bellum. And with y• the resolute souldier stabbed
himselfe. Astonied at this peremptorie massacre, although
all stained with the bloud of the Parthians: yet I could not
but grieue at the passion of the man, and enter into consideration
what that Loue should be, that wrought in mens
mindes such resolued effects: So well liking of his determined
death, y• I vowed in my thoughts if euer I obteined
the fauour of some gracious Damosell to write in bloude
with the Parthian, Non fortuna, non bellum. The remembrance
(honorable Senatours) of this tragedie made me
to shew my selfe so passionate. Lentulus hauing ended his
discourse, the Senatours generally praised the resolution
of the Parthian, and the Ladies the constancie of his wife,
all concluding that no impression could be so déepely inserted
into the heart loue. Terentia spying the flame by the
smoake, smyled to sée howe couertly Lentulus had cloaked
his thoughts, and how in vowing to be constant, he discouered
his conceit, so that turning hir backe shée went into
hir Closet, and there blamed Venus that had wrapt so
br
                  •
               ue a Champion in hir subtleties: not féeling either the
personage or perfections of Lentulus to stirre the staied
continencie of hir minde. Well the Senators not willing
to let this fall to the grounde, talked still of the Parthian,
and amongst the rest of those honourable guests that were

there feasted, Archias the Poet a man of a pleasant disposition,
tooke the tale by the ende, and beganne to prosecute
it thus.
            Graue Senatours I remember I haue heard Hortensus
the great Orator say, that in times past the Consuls
for recreatiō would vse light &amp; honest pastimes especially
myrth at meat, as ye fittest minister for digestiō, alleaging
Scipio &amp; Gracchus, who coueted to be as iocund at their
banquets, as they were serious in matters of estate. Séeing
then (reuerend fathers) Lentulus hath entred into
the discourse of loue, producing the Parthian, who amongst
his other singularities, boasted that his fancie had neuer
béene stained with Iealousie a plague that is greatly now
a daies predominant in Rome, might it please you to fauour
vs with your gracious consent, we woulde intreate
Lentulus to discourse to vs his opinion of iealousie. The
Senatours graunted, and Terentia, being come to giue
attendance on hir father, smyled. Lentulus casting his eie
vpon his loue, séeing a dimple in hir chéeke which was to
him Cos amoris, made Archias this present answere.
            Had the Thebans appointed Zetus to haue discoursed of
Musicke, or they of Thessaly, Menalcas to haue described
the Court: The principles of the one had béene as voide
of art, as the precepts of the other farre from honour: The
one being an enemie to Musicke, the other a swaine and
a shepheard. So (reuerend Senatours and honourable Ladies
of Rome) Archias, how skilfull so euer in Poetrie, yet
hath faild in his pollicie, to request him to discourse of iealousie,
that neuer as yet offred incence at the Altars of
Loue. If it had béene to make description of a battaile, to
haue discoursed the order of the Phalaux, or any point of
Martiall discipline, then could I as a souldier haue dilated
such principles, as warrelike Captaines register in the
field with their sword: But of loue whose amarous Deitie
gréeth not with Drumme and Trumpet, or of iealousie
as the shadowe of fancie, it fitteth me as little to discourse,

as the shoomaker of Apelles portrature. But if euer
Venus shall vouch me that fauour to grace me with a
speciall looke from my Mistresse excellencie, and that mine
eie be allowed as Paris was to iudge of beauties, Archias
shal commande me as a friend, in the meane time, for Poets
and Painters ought to haue their conceites fethered
with Mercuries plumes: I will desire Archias to supply
my ignorance, and to describe the effects of iealousie. The
Senators and the rest of the company, hearing how cunningly
Lentulus retorted the argument vppon Archias,
with a resolute consent they inioyned Archias to play the
Orator, who being pleasantly disposed began thus.
            The wolues in Syria that barke against the Moone suffer

starres pierce downeward: and the Syrens that

               ought to
intrappe Vlisses, perisht themselues. So gentlemen, I
sought to make experience of Lentulus eloquence, and fortune
hath allotted me to discouer mine owne ignorance,
but least I might be counted either too stoicall, or to too full
of sel
                  •
               e conceit: for iealousie, thus.
            
               
                  
                     
                        Archias discourse of Iealousie.
                        SUch as haue searched into the déepest Aphorismes of
Anacreon, or pried into the principles that Ouid sette
downe in his volumes, find Loue to be such a pure passion
of the mind, as like y• Christal it admitteth no bruse without
a cracke: It groweth from the vnion of two minds cō
                           ceiued
by y• special liking of some excellent good, consisting
in exteriour beauty, or interiour vertues, or the combining
of them both in one sole, and singular perfection. This
choice of excellencie confirmed by election once imprinted
in the hart is so pretious as the pearls of Cleopatra. The
fléece of Colchos, the sands of Tagus are trash, if brought
into compare with this diuine and metaphysicall passion:

man hauing swilled in this nectar of loue is so chary that
he not onely brooketh no corriual of his thoughtes, but admitteth
no partaker of his fauours, and from this feare
procéedeth that furie which men call ielousie, béeing a secrete
suspition that others shoulde enioy that excellencie
that he hath chosen sole and singular to him self. This noble
Romaines is that f

                           end that Pluto sent to checke Cupid
in his deitie, this springing from hell bringeth worse
torments to the minde then the stone of Sysiphus, vulture
of Titius or wheele of Ixion. This is the cankar that fretteth
the quiet of the thoughtes, the moath that secretlie
consumeth the life of man, and the poyson specially opposed
against the perfection of loue: after the heart be once
infected with ielousie the slepes are broken, the dreames
disquiet slumbers, the thoughts cares, &amp; sorrowes, the life
woe, &amp; miserie, that lyuing he dies, &amp; dying prolonges out
his life in passions worse then death. None looketh on
his loue but suspition sayes, this is he that couetes to be
corriuall of my fauours: None

                           ckes at his doore, but
starting vp he thinkes them messengers of fancie, none
talkes but they whisper of affection: if shée frowne, shée
hates him and loues others, if she smile it is because shée
hath had successe in hir loues, looke she frowardly on any
man she dissembles, if shee fauour him with a gratious
eye, then as a man straught with frensie hee eryeth out
that neither fire in the strawe nor loue in the womens
lookes can be concealed, thus doth he liue restles and maketh
loue that of it selfe is swéete, to be in taste as bitter
as gall.
                        This discouereth reuerent Senators that loue being of
it selfe a most excellent passion is onely blemisht by this
soule and disgraced staine of ielousie; as hateful and hurtfull
to the mind as the Cockatrice to the eye, or hemlocke
to the taste. The purest Chrisolite hath his strakes, the
flowers in Sydon as they are pretious in the sight so they
are pestilent in fauour: Loue as it is diuine with loialtie,

so it is hellish with ielousie, wherfore by an auncient Poet
were written these verses,

                              
                                 When Gods had framd the sweete of womens face,
                                 and lockt mens lookes within their golden haire:
                                 That Phoebus blusht to see their matchles grace,
                                 and heauenly gods on earth did make repaire.
                                 To quippe faire Venus ouerweening pride
                                 Loues happie thoughtes to ielousie were tied.
                              
                              
                                 Then grewe a wrinckle on faire Venus browe,
                                 The amber sweete of loue was turnd to gall:
                                 Gloomie was heauen: bright Phoebus did auowe
                                 He could be coy and would not loue at all,
                                 Swering no greater mischiefe could be wrought
                                 Then loue vnited to a ielous thought.

turned into a Heifer: if suspition had not prickt Menelaus,
Helena had not stolne away with Paris. Procris had
beene aliue, had shée not suspected Cephalus: Then worthie
Romaines we sée what a preiudiciall monster groweth
from the fearefull excesse of loue that not onely shortneth
the life, disquieteth the minde, but oft is the cause of
most strange and vnnatural massacres. If fortune frowne

               Archias hauing thus ended his discourse the Senators
greatly praised his description of iealousie, and from that
fell to other pleasant talke as occasion offred. Till dinner
being ended they arose, and after many thankes and curtesies
according to the custome of the Romanes, Flaminius
to honour Lentulus the more, taking him by the hand carried
him into a garden where Terentia sate accompanied
with other Uirgins of Roome: namely, Flauia, Cornelia,
and Iulia, all of such exquisite features, as they séemed to
be the choyce Paragons of that time. Lentulus amazed at
this gorgious sight wondred not onely at their beauties,
but maruailed why Flaminius brought him so friendly into
their presence. At last the old man burst forth into these
words: Lord Lentulus, I measure the thoughts of young
gentlemen by the prime of my forepassed youth, not being
so cinicall as with Chremes in Terence to proportion
young affections by the cynders of olde age, but to thinke
with Menedemus that the spring hath flowers and blossomes,

where as winter hath dried braunches and tawnie
leaues: We olde men ouer whom Saturnus is predominant
hauing infused melancholy in our mindes, couet either
to sit solitarie, or that our talke be serious: you that
are young whose thoughts aime at delight séeke to passe
the time in pleasant discourses. Least therefore the time
might be tedious, I haue brought you amongst these faire
Ladies y• you may make experience of loues, as you haue
done of warres, Mars no sooner puts off his helmet but he
salutes Venus: and you come from conquest of the Parthians,
see how you can enter combate with passions: and so
Lord Lentulus I leaue you.
            
               Lentulus seeing himself thus enuironed with these miracles
of beautie, casting his eye vpon the Goddesse whose
fauourable aspect might be the summe of his fortunes, bashed
at the first as Paris did in the vale of Ida, and stoode as
the foes of Perseus when hee vncased the head of Medusa,
and turned them to marble pictures, so amazed stood Lentulus
at the sight of such diuine excellencie, till the Ladies
seeing this Nouice thus in a quandarie beganne to smile,
which reuiuing a kind of amorous choller in the souldiers
minde, he beganne thus to play the Champion.
            Ladies beléeue me, Loue is of more force then warres,
and the lookes of women pierce déeper then the stroke of
Launces, their is no Curtelax so kéene, but armour of
high proofe can withstande, but beauties arrowes are so
sharpe, and the dartes that flie from womens eyes so piercing
as the Corslet tempered by Vulcan for Didoes paramour,
holdes not out the violence of there stroake. The
Gods tremble when Mars shaketh his Launce, but he feareth
when Venus casteth a frowne. Alexander neuer tooke
notice of the legions of his enemies, but he stoode frighted
at the beauty of the Amazon. Then swéet saints of Rome
maruell not if I were driuen into a maze at the sight of
such beauteous creatures whose faces are Venus weapons,
wherewith shée checketh the pride of ouer daring

warriours: I cannot (Ladies) court it as your Romaine
yongsters that tie their wits to their fancies: nor fil your
eares with amarous discourses as Cupids Apprentizes,
that spend their time in such louing philosophie: Nor can
I faine conceited supposes of affection to prooue my selfe
louesicke by Poetrie. But as a blunt souldier newe come
from the warres, I offer my selfe a deuoted seruant to
your beauties, swearing to defend your honours against
all men with the hazard of my bloud, and in pawne thereof
generally to you all, but specially to one (as loue hath
his vnitie) I desire to bee intertained as a duetifull
seruaunt to the Lady Terentia. Lentulus hauing thus
boldly boarded these louely Uirgins, the Ladies séeing
with what affection he offred his seruice to Terentia, began
to byte the lippe, and shée to blush who séeing hir selfe
toucht to the quicke made him this answere.
            I know not Lord Lentulus how to answere of loue, because
as yet I neuer knew loue: ignorant of his forces because
neuer acquainted with his fortunes. Vesta forbids
vs virgins to name Venus, as they of Ephesus hatefull
Erostratus. Diana deals not in Paphos, nor suffers shée any
of hir maidens to hunt on Erecynus, least méeting
with Venus mecocks they skippe with Calisto, and so séek
after losse. The lesse you are priuate to loues passions, the
more welcome to our presence: for rather had we still our
eares with warres fortunes, then with loues f
                  •
               llies: and
swéeter are the teares that grows from a constant stratageme,
then a smyle from a comike tale of fancie. For your
seruice Lord Lentu
                     •
                  us, finding my self vnworthy, I craue
pardon: Nor can wee by Vestas charter admitte such seruaunts.
But if it please you to bee accepted as a worthy
Romaine and my fathers friende, looke for such fauour as
mine honour and virginity can affoord.
            
               Lentulus hearing the plausible answere of Terentia, although
hir first insinuation seemed to answere for his purpose,
as preferring the lawnes of Diana, and fiers of Vesta
               
before loues holy temples, yet shée concluded so swéetely as
might stand with the modestie of hir honour: he therefore
made thus his reply.
            In that madame we are both nouices in loue, the simpler
are our thoughts, and the néerer should be the simpathy
of our affections. Doues match 
                  •
               hen 
                  •
               hey are young:
Syenus are grafted when they are sprigs, the one part
not but by death, nor are the other seuered but they perish.
Souldiers are like virgins, the one striuing to liue vertuous,
the other to die valiant: both enemies to loue, while
they wait on those which brooke not loue, I meane warre
and Vesta: But both must loue as hauing hearts and
thoughts, eies to sée beautie, and eares to iudge of vertue.
I madame while I thought none greater then Mars, was
vowed to Mars, but séeing womens wits are worse then
weapons, and that their lookes pierce déeper then launces,
I haue resigned ouer my fortunes at the shrine of warre,
and meane to make proofe of the swéetenesse of loue: Glad
that in my first entrance I haue the patronage of your
gracious fauour, armde with the which Mars well may
frowne, but not conquer. But sir, quoth Terentia, I graunted
my fauor to Lentulus the souldier, not to Lentulus the
louer. And so madame quoth he I accept of it, for I am a
souldier to doe you honour, and a louer despight of my self.
Flauia hearing Lentulus, beganne to reason pretily to the
purpose, being a Ladie of passing mirry disposition, whose
witte was as full of wiles as hir face of fauour, second in
the excellencie of beauty to the Lady Terentia, thought to
sift hir souldier in this manner.
            I sée well Lord Lentulus, that as women haue their fauours,
so men haue their sayings: the one prodigall in graces,
the other polliticke in deceits, being as cunning to dissemble
loue, as we chary to discharge loue. We Romaine
Ladies thought to haue founde you a flat souldier, as ignorant
in loues as we of fancies: but how closely soeuer
you couer the flame, the fire wil be knowne by the smoke:

For your talke so sauours of loues principles, as we iudg
                  •
               
you are as cunning in faining a passion as in figuring a
battaile, and can assoone deceiue a woman with a pen, as
slaughter an enemie with a launce. This will make vs
to take you for a day friend, and what we like in you present
to disallowe to morrowe, swearing if you bring amongst
vs Venus roses, wee will beate you with Vestas
nettles: and therefore if you will be admitted as our souldier,
wee either forbidde you the name of loue, or else you
shall be out of our fauours. Cornelia willing to breake a
iest with this Champion thwarted Flauia thus. And what
of that madame, hath not warre taught him patience: hee
hath past sharper brunts thē womens frownes. But how
your leuell is without aime? If madame Terentia smyl
                  •
               
his peny is good siluer, 
                  •
               is hir fauour that is the load-star
of his fortunes, and howe can we enter into hir thoughts
but by coniectures: shée ful of beauty, and he a proper yong
gentleman. At this frumpe the Ladies smiled, and Terentia
blusht for anger. But Lentulus séeing such a broad iest,
pinde on his shoulder willing to make answere for his
Mistresse, although he was sore put to his trumps as half
set at a Non plus, yet he followed his fortunes thus.
            Indéede Ladies thinke I haue patience to beare womens
frumpes that hath incountred an enemies blow, but
if I could as well answere the one, as quit the other, you
shuld neither carry it to hel, nor to heauē. But to reuenge
my selfe as well as I can, thus. First madame to cleare
my cunning in loue, I refer my selfe to the verdict of your
owne conscience: who were you but as fauourable, as you
are frumpish, would soone censure by my talke how déepe I
am reade in loues principles. But women speake by contraries,
crying like the lapwing farthest from their nests,
and so I take it being checkt for ouermuch loue, when you
sée I am a nouice in loue. Or perhaps madame Flauia you
would haue me loue, if it be so I will become more studious
to satisfie your wish: but your calling mee a day

friend that peremptory punishment were passing sharpe
for one fault to shake me out of seruice, were it not that
for so déepe a wound the Lady Cornelia bringeth in a lenitiue
plaisture alleadging my security if I bee armed with
Terentias fauour. Blame mee not swéete goddesses if I
aime at the fairest, souldiers haue eies that can iudge of
beauty, though they haue not weapons to winne beauty:
&amp; eares to déeme of perfections, though they want tongues
to discouer passions. The harmony of loue, I haue hearde
them say, consists in vnities, and nothing is more preiudiciall
to fancie then plurality either of thoughtes or of persons.
Amongst many then am I charged but to like of one
Mistresse: If I make choice of Terentia, and shee vouch to
grace me with hir fauour, Cornelia concludes truely, that
armde with the imagination of hir beauty, I thinke my
selfe able to brooke your frumps, and to withstand the hardy
resolution of Mars.
            
            I maruaile then quoth Flauia halfe in choller (if womens
beauty be like Delphicus gladius, of high proofe to
defend, and of sharpe edge to offend) why the Senatours
choose not out legions of Ladies, that with little cost and
great assurance, they may make conquest of the world:
but perhaps all souldiers be not of your temper, for they
vse their weapons and you your lookes.
            No madame quoth Lentulus y• is not the cause, for were
it not that euery woman would be a Captaine, and striue
for supremacie, they had resolued vpon this long agoe, but
fearing a mutiny amongst themselues for superiority: sith
euery one at home wil be counted most wise, &amp; most beautifull,
though their wits be meane, and fauours lesse, the
Senate are glad to foresée such an inconuenience. The
Ladies hearing howe cunningly Lentulus had gald madame
Flauia on the right side, began all to smyle, and shée
after a blush for very anger began to laugh. Lentulus glad
that he had giuen hir a soppe of the same sauce, and paide
hir hir debt in hir owne coine: Calling to his boy to fetch

him a Lute, willing to shew his mistresse he was not ignorant
in musicke, said he would prooue the force of beauty
by a sonet which he heard was made by Orpheus when
he fell first in loue with Euridice, tuning therefore his
Lute to his voyce he sung this ditty.
            
               Mars in a fury gainst Loues brightest Queene
               Put on his helme, and tooke him to his launce:
               On Erecynus mount was Mauors seene,
               And there his ensignes did the God aduaunce.
               And by heauens greatest gates he stowtly swore,
               Venus should die for shee had wrongd him sore.
            
            
               Cupid heard this and he began to cry,
               And wisht his mothers absence for a while:
               Peace foole quoth Venus, is it I must die?
               Must it be Mars? with that shee coind a smile:
               Shee trimd hir tresses and did curle hir haire,
               And made hir face with beauty passing faire.
            
            
               A fan of siluer feathers in hir hand,
               And in a coach of Ebony shee went:
               Shee past the place where furious Mars did stand,
               And out hir lookes a louely smile she sent.
               Then from hir brow lept out so sharpe a frowne,
               That Mars for feare threw all his armour downe.
            
            
               He vowed repentance for his rash misdeede,
               Blaming his choller that had causd his woe:
               Venus grew gratious, and with him agreed,
               But chargd him not to threaten beauty so.
               For womens lookes are such inchaunting charmes,
               As can subdue the greatest god in armes.
            
            
               Lentulus hauing sung this ditty, Terentia willing a
little to shew hir wit began thus. I remember Lord Lentulus,
               
I haue heard my father say that souldiers were
w
                  ••
               nt to carry fauours in their helmes, not fancies in
their heart: and made choice of their mistresse to incourage
their thoughts, not to inchaunt their affections. But
I see the auncient hon

               ur of the Romaines is slipt from
prowesse to passions, and the men couet to be counted rather
amorous wooers, then hardy warriours: gasing Mars
in the face with bright armour, but offring Orisons to
Venus in secrete conceites. This did not Quintus Lucius
Cincinnatus, who sette it downe as Crimen Capitale
to speake of loue in the Armie. Nor Scypio Affricanus

brought prisoners within the Campe, least loue entring

               And burnes the pallace of his fond desires.
               With chast disdaine they scorne the foolish god,
               And prooue him but a boy not past the rod.
            
            
               Terentia hauing ended hir roundelay, as Lentulus was
ready to replie, Flaminius came into y• Garden with ye rest

the company at last taking their leaues yeelding
great thankes to Flaminius for their good chée
                  •

               ipping from the
rest of the companie and with a gratious courage tooke
his adue of Terentia and the other of the Ladies, vowing
to be theirs euer in any due honourable seruice, and so
staying Terentia by the hande he went home with Titus
Annius Milo: where he founde Marcus Tullius Cicero,
then a youth in Rome about ye age of twenty yeres &amp; very
priuate and familiar with Milo. The fame of this Tullies
surpassing 
                  •
               loquence was so bruted abroade in Rome as
they counted him the myrror of that time &amp; as in Greece
               
they wondred at Demosthenes for his orations, and the
popular people fedde their eies with his sight, so as Tully
past through the stréets they cryed out, Hic est ille Cicero:
saying that as Orpheus with his musicke made the stones
and trees pliant to his melody: so Tully tyed the peoples
cares to his tongue by his eloquence: And that Plato who
for his philosophicall sentences was called diuine, in
whose lippes bées rested as presaging his future excellencie
was inferiour to Tully in the musicall concord of his
phrase. Lentulus noting his perfections although his parentage
was base, yet thinking his eloquence might be
profitable to his loues, grewe to bee very familiar with
Tully, insomuch that of vnacquainted citizens they grew
to be deare and priuate friends, that their thoughts were
vnited with a sure league of amity, and their hearts were
receptacles for their mutuall passions, so that their most
secrete affaires were frankely participated without any
doubting suspition. But leauing their familliarity, conuersing
in Milos house: Let vs gentlemen sée how Terentia
brookt his departure. Cornelius Nepos forgets it in
Tullies life, 
                  〈◊〉
                if you will beléeue me it was thus.
            No sooner were the Senatours and Lentulus departed
from Flaminius house, but Flauia and the rest of the Ladies
tooke leaue of Terentia, who being solitary by hir selfe
sitting alone in an arbour of roses, began to ruminate on
the Idaea of Lentulus perfection, and to call to minde his
seueral and singular qualities, his parentage, his person,
honors, and his great possessions, but all in vaine. Loues
poyson was preuented with an antidote, and hir thoughts
sealed vp with an inuincible chastity. For after shée had
long sate: At last with a smyle shée burst foorth into these
tearmes.
            If Venus could not infuse more dismall aspects in other
Ladies thoughts then into my minde, they should neither
hold hir as a goddesse, nor honour hir temples with presents:
Fonde are those women that are inquisitiue after

Astrologers, whether Venus be retrograde or combust in
their natiuities. Had they but tasted the swéete fauour of
Vestas incense, they would abandon hir as a planet carelesse
in their natiuities: and not trouble the Augurs or Aruspices
to censure of their fatall or fortunate fancies. For
had they but insight into the swéete life of virgins, how secure
they liue, if they liue vertuous, they woulde neuer
intangle themselues with the inconstant snares of fancy.
Vesta allowes vs frée thoughts, Venus disquiet passions

               éepes, in the others pallace
broken slumbers. Diana counteruailes our labours with
myrth and quiet, in Cipres we finde toyle tempered with
care and sorrowes. Being virgins we haue liberty: maried
we tie our selues to the variable disposition of a husband,
who be he neuer so excellent in perfection, or exquisite
in proportion, we shall finde sufficient whereof to gather
di
                  ••
               ike. Then Terentia, let Lentulus passe with his
honors he hath subdued. What though Alexander woone
the whole world, his glories are but fortunes fauours. Account
him then onely as thou promised, thy fathers friend
and thine as farre as he treats not of weddi
                  ••
                and with
this vpon a sodaine shée start vp, and went to passe away
the time amongst companie, holding Cupids deity at disdaine,
and accounting of loue as the Samnites did of golde:
which they sent as presents to their enemies, but banisht
from their owne common wealth. But Flauia poore Lady,
was not pierced with so easie a passion, for shée hauing
more déepely imprinted in hir thoughtes his honours and
vertues, and measuring the man by the height of his fortunes,
fell into these bitter complaints.
            With what little proportion doth iniurious Loue bestowe
his fauours? With howe small regarde doth blinde
fortune powre out hir treasures? Making in all their actions
contrarieties. that so they may triumph in inconstancie.
Loue hath brought Lentulus from the wars to Rome,
onely to sée Terentia. Fortune hath brought Flauia
               
to the house of Flaminius onely to loue Lentulus, shée little
regarding him, he lightly respecting me. Thus hath the
contrariety of loue and fortune made Lentulus vnhappy,
and me without hope. Ah but Terentia though shée séeme
coy at the first, will bee more curteous at the last, when
shée hath had but a moneths meditating on the excellency
of Lentulus. Then, oh then sigh Flauia, and say oh then wil
Terentia not reiect so honourable a personage: When shée
considers his youth, his beauty, his parentage, his dignities
Lentulus no sooner shall wooe, but shée will be woonne:
This is the coniecture of hir hap, &amp; the dispaire of my hope.
And yet it may be that the destinies haue appointed their
disagrée. For starres are sticklers in loue, and fates are
principall fautors of wedlocke. If my prayers may serue

                  •
               o Venus, if my incense to Cupid, if my vowes to Lucina,
if my sute to Loue. Let their loue perish in the budde, and
wither in the blossoms. Had I Medeas magicke, the drugs
of Calipso, the inchauntments of Cyrces, the skill of Hecate,
all these should be imployed to breake the loue of Terentia,
and Lentulus. Fond Flauia, to be so franticke in thy
passions: suppose Terentia hated Lentulus, can this conclude
he wil loue thée? No, his thoughts are setled, his rest
set downe, his vowes made, his fancy fixed, &amp; all vpon ye
beautiful Terentia: I there Flauia y• is ye word ye galleth to
the beautifull Terentia. For of such surpassing beauty is
the Lady, that as Cynthia brookes no compare with hir
glorious brother: so thou must not enter comparison with
y• daughter of y• Senatour Flaminius. But what is this to
Lentulus. If shée be faire, yea as faire as euer was Sulpitia:
if shée be as coy, and disdainefull as Caelia, had he not
better loue homely Flauia, who will counteruaile with
loue, what shée wants in beautie, and proportion out in
duety, what shée defects in dignity. But what of this, loue
admits no exceptions, he cannot mis

Doth not present examples yea instances executed in
Roome auerre so much? Is not Anthonio enamoured of
the blacke Egyptian Cleopatra: Doth not Caesar enuy

him in his loues and couets to be corriuall of his fancies.
Affection is oft blinde and déemeth not rightlie, The blackest
Ebon is brighter then the whitest Iuorie: and Venus
thought Vulcan at the first a proper stripling. Were Terentia
neuer so coy, Lentulus will count hir disdaine but
chastitie: yet Flauia pray then she may liue in this mislike,
then hast thou yet some cause to hope, otherwise wéepe
thy fill, dispaire and then die, for swéeter is death then to
liue and sée Lentulus enioy the loue of Terentia. Hauing
at this period breathed awhile readie to goe forwarde in
passions, one of hir waiting women came in who breaking
of hir complaintes past away the rest of the day in
prattle. Leauing hir therfore and hir maide at chat, again
to Lentulus, who tooke such inwarde griefe at this newe
conceited loue, that his colour began to waxe pale and to
discouer passions his sighes many and often to bewray
his sorrows, his sodayne startes in his sléepes, and his
musinges surcharged with melancholie. These noted by
Tullie his priuate friende made him coniecture that somewhat
was amisse with Lentulus. Hauing therefore fit opportunitie
he began to sift him in this manner.
            The auncient Gréetians swéete Lentulus y• set downe
principles of friendship, account the secrete conuersi
                  •
               g of
friendes, and their mutuall participating eyther of priuate
sorrows or concealed pleasures, the principall end of
such professed amitie. Therefore did Theseus choose Pirithous,
Orestes Pylades &amp; to that end, or else you wronge
me, serues Tullie to his Lentulus. If then it be requisite in
friendshippe to abandon suspitious secrecie, I cannot but
take it vnkindly that Tullie is not made partaker of Lentulus
passions. For as the Carbuncle is not hid in the
darke, nor the fire shut vp in strawe, so sorrowes cannot
so couertly be concealed but the countenance will purtray
out the cause by the effectes. Thinke me not then so blind
but I can Iudge of coullors, nor so simple but I can deeme
of affections, what meane these farre fetcht sighes, broken

slumbers, this newe delight to be solitarie, but that Lentulus
féeling a passion that pierceth to the quick, yet séekes
to kéepe it secrete from his friend Tullie. Knowe this my
good Lentulus that smoake depressed stiffleth more deadly.
That the Ouen the closer it is damd vp the greater is
the heate: and passions the more priuate the more preiudiciall.
Stop not then the streame, least it ouerflow. Conceale
not sorrowes least they ouercharge, and prooue like
woundes, that kepte long from the Chirurgian growe
to be incurable vlcers: If it be a Fathers frowne, an enemies
wrong, a friendes mishap, reueale it and séeke
remedie. If Lentulus gréeues hath left his honours in Parthia,
feare not, Rome will haue more warres and Lentulus
new dignities. If the Senatoures haue delt ingratefully:
Solamen miseris socios habuisse doloris. The most
famous Romaines haue forerunne thée in such hard fortunes.
Scipio subdued Affrica, what his rewarde was let
our annualles report. If Lentulus misliks ought in Rome,
let him abandon Rome, and Tullio will banishe himselfe
from his countrie too with his friend Lentulus. If since
thy comming into this storehouse of natures prodigalitie,
thiue eye hath made suruaie of anie gorgious Damsell,
and so my Lentulus be in loue although wisedome wills
to hide amors euen from amitie, and to tie fancie in the
lowest cell of his heart, yet reueale it to thy friende Tullie,
and if any way hee may ease his Lentulus passions, hee
vowes to salue thy sore, though with the hazarde of his
owne safetie. Lentulus hearing his friende leuell so néere
the marke gaue a great grone at the name of loue, and fetching
a déepe sighe saide Actna grauius Amor. And with
that starting from the place where hee sat taking Tullie
by the hande, he began thus.
            Were it my Tullie that my passions had any hope of
remedie, or that my wounde were such as might bee cured
by counsell, long ere this had Lentulus powred his
plaintes into the bosome of his friende Cicero: but my

sorrows, as they are piercing so I haue kept them priuate,
as hoping for no ease and yet delighting in my martiredome.
The birde flieth the snare of the fouler, No sooner
doth the woodman bend his bowe, but the Déere trippes
through the lawnes: euerie creature is taught by nature
to feare his fall, and yet wretched Lentulus hunteth after
his owne mishappe. So haue I described the furie of my
passions, as I can not but say it is loue that is thus impatient.
Loue my Tullie that is such a lord as ins
                  •
               nuating
his power with fauour he kéeps possession by force. Wars
haue their endes either honors or death, and in battaile
prowesse oft makes constraint of fortune, but in loue delay
is the vnhappie deathsman that holding thée vp neither
saues nor killes. Since my comming to Rome (my
Tullie) coueting to conuerse with beautifull Ladies as before
I had done with martiall souldiers, amongst manie
curious Pearles I founde one Orient Margarite richer
then those which Caesar brought from the western shores
of Europe: so long I gased at the beautie of this pretious
Iem that I founde my selfe gald with such affection, as
well repeat I might, but recall I coulde not: and for thou
shalt say she is loue worthie. heare how in discribing hir
excellencie I haue plaide the Poet.
            
               
                  Lentulus description of Terentia
in Latin.
                  Qualis in aurora splende scit lumine Titan,
                  Talis in eximio corpore forma fuit:
                  Lumina seu spectes radiantia, siue capillos,
                  Lux Ariadne tua &amp; lux tua Phoebe iacet.
                  Venustata fuit verbis, spirabat odorem,
                  Musica vox, nardus spiritus almus erat:
                  
                     Rubea labra, genae rubrae, faciesque decora,
                  In qua concertant lilius atque rosa.
                  Luxuriant geminae formoso in pectore mammae,
                  Circundant niueae candida colla comae:
                  Denique talis erat diuina Terentia, quales
                  Quondam certantes, Iuno, Minerua, Venus.
               
            
            
               
                  Thus in English.
                  BRightsume Apollo in his richest pompe,
                  was not like to the tramels of hir haire:
                  Hir eyes like Ariadnes sparkling starres,
                  shone from the Ebon Arches of hir browes.
                  Hir face was like the blushing of the east,
                  when Titan chardge the mornings Sun to rise:
                  Hir cheekes rich strewd with roses and with whyte,
                  did stayne the glorie of Anchises loue.
                  Hir siluer teates did ebbe and flowe delight,
                  Hir necke colummes of polisht Iuorie.
                  Hir breath was perfumes made of violets,
                  And all this heauen was but Terentia.
               
            
            NO sooner had Lentulus ended his well written Poem,
and concluded his cunning with the name of his mistresse,
but Tullie hearing Terentia was the saint at
whose shrine Lentulus offred vp his deuotion, entring his
exordium with a smyle he began to be thus pleasaut.
            And is there no fruit will serue your taste but such as
growe in the Gardens Hesperides, nor no colour content
your eye but such as is stayned by the fish Murex. Must
your senses be fed with nothing but that is excellent, nor
your loue haue no meane but to aime at the fairest. What
Terentia the beautie of Rome? the pride of nature? the

wealth of all the fauouring graces, whose excellencies are
spreade throught the triple deuision of the worlde? I see
my Lentulus souldiers haue eyes as they haue hands, and
thoughtes as they haue weapons, and that howe bluntlie
so euer brought vp in the warres yet they are curious in
the choises of their loues. Well, be it Lentulus loues Terentia,
an honour to set his fancie on hir, but hee kept his
loue secret frō 
               Tullie a fault to be suspicious of his friend.
But why gréeues Lentulus? Is not his parentage greater
then the house of Flaminius? Is not his honours sufficient
to counteruaile hir beauties? Why then is he so impatient
in so agreable a passion? Lentulus vpon this discoursed
vnto Tullie from point to point the successe of his
loues, how he gaue his charge ouer to Lepidus onely that
he might haue a sight of Terentia, and then recounting
what prattle had past betwixt him and hir after dinner:
Hir coy answeres and firmed resolution to remaine chast:
crauing counsell howe he might ease the disquiete of his
thonghts: Tullie pittying the extreeme passion of his
friende, deuised sundrie meanes howe to make him lorde
of his desires. But after the discourse of sundry plottes,
it was decreed that Lentulus shoulde write vnto Teren-Terentia.
Lentulus dispairing of his owne stile and methode,
required Tully to write him a letter passionate and
full of familiar eloquence, which at his request Cicero
contriued after this manner: where by the way gentlemen,
I am to craue you to thinke that Terentia kept
the copy secrete, so that neither it can bee founde amongst
Lentulus loose papers, nor in the familiar epistles
of Cicero. If the phrase differ from his other excellent
forme of writing, imagine he sought to couer his style, and
in his pen rather to play the blunt souldier, then the curious
Orator, neither vsing those verborum fulmina, that
Papyrius obiects, nor that swéete and musicall cadence of
words, which he vseth to Atticus, but howsoeuer or whatsoeuer,
thus it was.
            
               
                  
                  Lentulus, Terentiae salutem.
                  QVod natura in venustatis &amp; formae tuae Idaea formauit
(suauissima Terentia) nullo modo silentio praeterire
possum: Ne cum nimis cautus amoris ignem celare

&amp; arma cogitans, a Roma vsque formae tuae pulchritudo,
morumque integritas à multis saepe nuntiata est. Cuius rei faema
ca iucunditate aures meas permulsit, vt (syrenum quasi
cantu delectatus) arma abijcere &amp; amorem cogitare coeperim,
meque totum in Terentiae potestatem tradere non erubescerem.
Diuinae autem excellentiae tuae cogitatio, eos mihi pro tempore
in bellicis negotijs addidit animos, vt breui deuictis
&amp; profligatis Parthis, totam hanc Prouinciam Lepido commiserim,
quem vnum tum honoris, tum fortunae meae participem
feci, Parthisque relictis Romam me contuli, vt iucundissimo
fructu tum aspectus, tum consuetudinis tuae frui liceat.
Formae vero &amp; pulchritudinis tuae dignitas, tanta tamque excellens
fuit, vt non modo famam, sed expectationem meam
longe superarit. Vnde exquisitam tuam perfectionem oculis
contemplans, &amp; singulares animi dotes auribus accipiens, excellentiae
tuae Idaeam in imo pectore collocaui meque totum amori,
quasi constring endum tradidi. Cum igitur tua vnius
causa (suauissima Terentia) famam fortunasque &amp; arma
proiecerim, verum amantis officium fac praestes, &amp; me non
meritis, sed amore fac metiare, vt in amore tu mihi respondens,
ego in omni officio tibi satisfaciam. Taceo genus &amp;

vt Orator, sed peramanter, vt imperator tibi scribo, quod si

                  Lentulus to Terentia health.
                  I cannot (swéete soueraigne of my thoughts, and chiefe
myrrour of our Romaine excellencie) smother that with
silence which nature hath figured in the portraiture of my
lookes, vnlesse kéeping the flame too secrete, I shoulde like

                        tna consume to cinders. When seated amongst the Parthians
hauing nothing in my thoughtes but warres and
stratagemes, thy beauty was repeated as speciall newes
from Roome amongst the Legions: The melodie séemed
so pleasing to mine eares as if the musicke of the Syrens
had inchaunted my senses. I ceased from warres to think
of loue, and from loue to doate on the conceit of Terentia.
The thoughtes of thy excellencie doubled such courage in
my attempts, that I conquered the Parthians, yéelded vp
my charge to Lepidus, made him partaker of my honors,
and fortunes, and came to Roome onely to sée Terentia:
                     
whose sight was so beauteous, and so farre beyond the report
of fame, that mine eies surueying exquisitely thy perfections,
and mine eares censuring of thy wit and vertues
both in league conspired to present the Idea of thy selfe to
the contemplation of my heart, which gréedily intertaining
such rare beauties, hath euer since remained a poore
distressed captiue. Sith then Terentia, thy Lentulus hath
left his fortunes to followe fancy, and hath forsaken the
warres to winne thy loues, holding thée more deare then

                     r, shewe thy selfe a Romaine Lady, that
striuing in minde to be matchlesse, thou mayest bee more
prodigall in fauours, then I worthy in deserts, and yéelde
mée such méede for my loue, as Lentulus for his loyaltie
doth merite. I 
                        •
                     oast not of my parents, they are Citizens
&amp; of the Senate wt thy father. I speak not of mine honors,
the Capitol can witnes what showtes past from the Romaines
as victors: what tears from the Parthians as vanquished,
both these passions growing from the fortunes of
Lentulus. My reuenewes are such as satisfie my desires:
But all these are externall fauours, which though I rehearse
yet I bragge not off. But the constancy of my loue,
the loyalty of my thoughts: These Terentia are gifts of
the mind, deseruing no light estéem, much lesse to be requited
with ingratitude. Consider then (swéete goddesse) the
sincerity of mine affections: weigh howe Lentulus loues,
and so vse him in loue, measure his fortunes by his fancies.
As thou art beautifull, so vse iustice, giue euery one
his due: Honour to the gods, reuerence to thy father, faith
to thy friend, and Loue to Lentulus, and if it please thée to
grace me with the title to thy husband Lentulus: for I couet
to like honestly, not to loue wantonly. I write Terentia
as a souldier without eloquence, and as a louer without
flattery, if thou satisfie my loue with thy fauours, I
doubt not to seale vp thy content with thy fathers and
friends agrée. If either thou art tied to former loues, or
mislikest of mine, I will close vp my sorrows with silence.

Howsoe
                        •
                     er it shall please thée to returne answere: Liue
with content, and die with honour.
                  
                     Terentias newe intertained souldier,
Publius Cornelius Lentulus.
                  
               
            
            If gentlemen I haue not translated Lentulus letter
verbatim worde for worde, let me in mine owne excuse
yéelde these reasons, that neither the familiar phrase of
the Romaines can brooke our harsh cadence of sentences:
nor durst I attempt to wrest Tullies eloquence to my rude
and barbarous english: fearing either to wrong so worthy
an Orator in displacing or rather disgracing his phrase: or
in too far presuming purchase your frowne, which I haue
euer in all duty sought to auoid. But howsoeuer my translation
séemes wrested, I haue kept his. And so to Lentulus,
who hearing Tully reade the epistle, both conceited
the methode, and allowed of the manner: Onely carefull
where to get a fit and conuenient messenger. Tully at last
called to remembrance one Eutrapelus, an especiall friend
of his, who frequented the house of Flaminius, by him did
Lentulus sende the letter, and so liuing in hope of a happy
answere, he left Tully in his study, and went to the Capitoll.
Cicero no sooner was by himselfe, but calling to mind
the description of Terentia: set out with such excellency by
Lentulus in his new learnd poetrie, and weighing how al
Roome woondred at hir beauties: began to féele certaine
sparkes of loue kindling in his young desires, which made
him blush at his owne thoughtes, and smile that fancy
shoulde lie lurking amongst his library to take him at discouert.
But assoone as he remembred that Lentulus was
in loue with hir, the faith to his friend, was a cooling carde
to his affections: and hee quenched those sparkes at the
first, lest suffered they might grow to a greater flame: yet
was he maugre his heade forced to say thus much.
            Hast thou liued fortunate, and fauoured in Roome?
               
hath honour raised thée from a meane cottage to be a companion
to the sonnes of Senators? Doe the Consuls make
thee for thy learning one of the Pret
                     •
                  xtati? and wilt thou
for the hope of foolish beauty staine all thy fauours and
fortunes with disgrace? Nay rather Tully it will be honor
to wooe the daughter of so famous a Romaine: but shame
to thee to take the repulse and be denied. Thinkest thou
Terentia will looke so lowe? will Eagles catch at flies? wil
the woonder of our time, the paragon of our age, allied to
the noblest houses in Roome, make choise of so base and
meane a person? What hast thou to deserue hir loue, any
more then a little babling eloquence. Womens eares are
not their touchstones but their eies: they sée and make
choyse, not heare and fancy. A dramme of honour weighs
downe a pound of wit: and better is it to court with welthy
reuenewes, then with swéete lines, or fine coucht poemes.
Thou hast nothing left but a poore farme called Cumanum,
whose rents quits not the charges of thy studies.
But suppose thou couldst winne Terentia, suffice shée is
loued by Lentulus: and therefore frō this day name hir not
in thy mouth, nor weare hir in thy thoughtes, least thou
violate friendship, which thou ought to prise dearer then
life. Thus Tully appeasing his passions went out of his
study and willed Eutrapelus to deliuer the letter with secrecy:
who being one of Tullies chief familiars, went with
all spéede to the house of Flaminius, where finding the Ladie
Terentia sitting with Flauia &amp; Cornelia at worke, he
being homo facetus began merily to commend their huswifery
&amp; after some iests broken betwixt the gentlewomē
&amp; him he craued to speak wt 
               Terentia about certain serious
affairs y• greatly imported hir father. Wherupon shée rising
&amp; going with Eutrapelus into hir closet he there deliuered
vnto hir Lentulus letter. Terentia abashed at the sight
blushed as half angrie with Eutrapelus, that he made him
selfe messenger in so vaine a matter, yet considering it
came from so honourable a personage as Lentulus, shée

vouchsafed it &amp; wisht Eutrapelus in the euening to come
for an answere. He was no sooner departed, but Terentia
vnripped the seales and then red the contentes, which being
contrarie to hir resolution, shée determined to returne
with a deniall. But for that she would make hir friends
priuie to hir new loues passions she went smiling in, and
shewed them the letter. Upon poore Lentulus plainesong
they all began to descant. Cornelia praysing Terentias
fortunes that was so enterely beloued of so honourable &amp;
braue a Gentleman, but Flauia hung the lippe and saying
little, only askt what a louing answere she would write.
I know not howe to replie quoth Terentia, he hath written
so eloquently and so cunningly. But quoth Flauia I
durst pawne my credite it was written by young Tullie,
that braue Orator: for I haue red some of his Epistles,
and tis both his methode and his verie phrase. That Tullie,
quoth Terentia whom I haue heard my Father and
the Senators so highlie commend for his witte, thinking
him to excéede either Crassus or Hortensius? and with that
sitting downe they began to enter into discourse of Tullies
excellencies, concluding all that he was as singular amongst
the Romaines, as euer Demosthenes was amongst
the Grecians. At last Terentia remembring hir
selfe, tooke leaue for a whyle of hir two friendes, and stealing
into hir closet stepping to the standish shée was about
to write, but calling to minde the discourse of Tullies perfection,
letting fall hir penne she fell into a passion. Cupid
wayting to spie this vestall at aduantage, séeing hir
halfe at discouert vulosde a bolt headed with desire, and
fethered with conceite, which piercing the tender briest
of this young Damosell, he made hir shrinck at the blow,
and so breath out this complaint.
            Hast thou Terentia béene wondred at in Rome for despising
loue, and wilt thou now doting gyrle stomble on
desire, shall fancie eclipse all thy former glories▪ shall Vesta
léese a virgin, and Venus winne a wanton? Wilt thou

resemble the buddes of an Elder trée, which young are
swéete and holesome, but blomd foorth are bitter and preiudiciall:
thinke with thy selfe that Dianas shrubs are
more pleasaunt, than Cupids bowers, the one harbours
chast thoughts, the other amorous fancies. Truth, but
Lucina is a goddesse, loue is diuine, and marriage honorable.
Cedars are fayre, but in yéelding no fruite they
purchase the lesse estéeme. To be a virgin is a glorious
title, but to liue euer so, is to wrong nature in hir fauors.
Well hast thou not then Terentia a noble gentleman of
Rome, Lord Lentulus to bee thy husbande, a man whose
youth is filled with honours and whose spring time 
                  ••
               orisheth
dignities? hath he not triumpht ouer the Parthians
in conquest &amp; boūd fortune to his temples with wreathes
of victorie. Is not his parentage one of the greatest families
in Rome? Is he not for beautie like the fayre Gréekes
Paramour? For wisedome like wise Vlisses that Cyrces
could not inchant? For courage Hector? Aud of such reuenewes
as may maintaine thee with the most gorgeous
dames of Italie? But the chiefe of his graces is he not
enamored of Terentia and sues for hir fauour. This I
confesse, Sed deteriora sequor. Loue ah that foolish passion
which we tearme loue allowes nothing excellent but
what it likes. It shadowed begarie in Crates. For Hipsycratea
thought him rich in that he was vertuous: deformitie
in Vulcan, for Venus would not beléeue hee had a
poult foote. Loue hath no lacke, and lesse reason: yet must
I loue, and whome, ah Tullie swéete Tullie, from whose
mouth flows melodie, more inchaunting then the Syrens,
on whose lips the muses make a newe Parnassus, in whose
thoughts rest Platos diuine spirites, and in whose heade
is contayned the subtil
                  •
                witte of Aristotle. Is not hee as
glorious in Rome for his eloquence, as thou for thy beauties?
Doth not the Senators wounder at his learning,
as at thy perfection? Why should not then both our singularities
be lincked in the vnion of Loue? why shoulde

not Terentia liue to Tullie, and Tullie to Terentia? Ah but
he is base, the first of his kyn that tasted of honour, I but
he is vertuous and famous for his eloquence, graces that
counteruaile the meanesse of his parentes. I sée loue hath
reasons béeing out of reason still to argue against reason,
therfore without further pro &amp; contra in mine owne passions,
I wil loue Tullie, &amp; therfore thus to Lentulus. With
that taking vp hir penne she wrote him this aunswere.
            
               
                  Terentia to Lentulus health.
                  WHen I red Lorde Lentulus thy letters and spied thy
loues, I blusht at mine owne thoughtes, and sorrowed
at thy fortunes. I serch not the cause of thy loue,
for it sufficeth to me thou doest loue, if it lay in me either
to graunt thy desire, or satisfie thy passions. Thy reasons
are sufficient to moue, were it not my vowe and my destines
direct my minde to contrary thy affections. Thy
honours Lentulus knockes at the closet of my heart, thy
victories sue for their lordes libertie, thy loyaltie enters
pele mele with my thoughtes and giueth a sore assault to
my setled resolutiō, all these put in their pleas to purchase
fauour for young Lentulus. But Vesta hard harted Vesta
that makes hir virgings pliant to hir owue properties,
commaunds that I shut mine ears against such alluring
Syrens. I count my selfe greatly honoured with the
loue of so worthie a Romayne, and euer will Terentia co

to prooue as thankfull as he affectionate; onely in loue
pardon me, for that either I neuer meane to loue, or if I
doe loue, my thoughtes were fixed before Lentulus came
from Parthia. Wade not there where the ford hath no footing,
barke not with the Wolues of Syria against the
Moone, looke not to clim
                        •
                      
                     Olimpus, way not at impossibilities,
but pacifie that with patience which thou canst
not obtaine with beeing passionate. If thou suest

to my Father and he graunt to conclude a mariage, yet
shalt thou want a bride, for I will first die before I violate
my resolution. Séeke not then by my preiudice to
aime at thy owne content, which be it euery way, yet it
shall neuer be in my loue: not that I hate Lentulus, but
that my fortunes forbides me to loue Lentulus. If thou
thinkst these denials be but words of course, and perswadest
thy selfe that women will bee first coy and then courteous
as the marble that drops of raine do pierce. Thou
shalt déepely deceiue thy selfe and highlie wrong me, but
I challenge thy promise, that howsoeuer I fr
                        •
                     strate thy
expectation thou wilt burie thy conceipte in silence. In
which hope gréeuing that thy showers came in Autumne,
I wish quiet to thy thoughts and an ende to thy loues.
                  
                     Thine euer but in loue Terentia.
                  
               
            
            
               TErentia hauing thus ended hir letter and newe begun
hir loues, the one directed to Lentulus the other deuoted
to Tullie, she went straight to hir two friends Cornelia
and Flauia shewing them the contentes of the letter.
Cornelia saide she was too seuere and stoicall in sending
such a peremptorie aunswere to so braue a gentleman.
Flauia ouercharged with ioy praysed the resolution of Terentia,
wishing that all maides were of hir minde, mis
                  •
               iking
that which shée most loued, thinking by retreating
Terentia from the chace, to be mistresse of the game hir
selfe. Well this letter at last was sealed, and deliuered to
Eutrapelus, who hying him fast to Tullies lodging founde
Lentulus and him in secrete and serious discourse, and all
god wot was about Terentia. Lentulus hauing receiued
the letter entring with Tullie into his study read the contents.
No sooner had he viewed &amp; reuiewed ouer hir cruell
determination but in a great extas
                  •
               e of minde, he cried out
(Dulcior est mors quam Amor.) And with that flinging

out of his study he fell into bitter and extreame sorrows.
Tully grieuing at his friendes harde fortune sought with
plausible perswasions to appease his furious melancholy,
wishing him whatsoeuer Terentia wrote stil to thinke hir
a woman that would one while thrust out fancy with a
finger, and straight interteine loue as a friend: that either
time or his constancy woulde make hir stoope to the lure
of his desires. Thus sought Tully to wrest him from his
passions but in vaine, for hir resolution confirmde with
such effectuall and perswasiue determinations so quatted
the conceit of his former hope, that going passing melancholy
to his bed, he fell into an extreame feuer, which aggrauated
with the inward anguish of his minde grewe to
be so dangerous that Asclapo the physit
                  •
               on excellent at
that time for his facultie, iudged the disease 
                  •
               o be mortall.
The Senatours hearing of Lentulus sickenesse sorrowed,
as fearing Roome by death shoulde bee depriued of such
high ensuing hope: his friends f
                  •
               ocked to his lodging to visite
him, who noting, the heate of the ague, and the passions
of his minde, his sodaine starts, his gash lookes, and
his abrupt answeres, iudged the extremity of his sickenes
had halfe brought him to a lunacy, all séeking by counsaile
to cure that which neither counsail nor medicine could mitigate.
Frustrate of their expectatiō they wished his weal
and returned with grief. Only Tully whose setled friendship
no misfortune could remooue, still day and night as a
second Esculapius, wayted vpon this perplexed patient.
But as the depth of his passion pierced into the center
of his heart, so the feuer increased, that generally Roome
began to sorrow so braue a warriour shoulde bee cut off in
the very prime of his fortunes, insomuch that the report of
his sickenes came to the eares of the thrée Ladies. Terentia
made light account as hauing hir heart hardned with
the loue of Cicero, but Flauia grewe passing passionate, as
being toucht at the quicke with the weake disposition of
Lentulus, wishing he might haue cure for his malady, so

it were not by the meanes of Terentia: shée frequented the
temples, offred orizons, made vowes and burnt incense to
the gods, that they would be fauourable to hir louer Lentulus,
coueting if possible it might be with the preiudice of
hir selfe to haue profited him: but in vaine, Terentia was
resolute, and he was resolued: as shée was dainty, so to die
in disp
                  •
               ire. Flauia if hir modesty might haue permitted,
would haue accompanied with other Ladies gone to
his lodging, but the rights of Vesta forbidding such familiar
conuersing, shée rather was restrained by force then
withhelde by reason. But seeing shée coulde by no meanes
come to his sight, yet to manifest the sincerity of hir loue,
shée sent him a letter to this effect.
            
               
                  Flauia to Lentulus health.
                  IF I could (Lord Lentulus) pourtray with outward actions,
the secrecy of my passions, or force as many teares
from mine 
                        •
                     ies as there flie sighes from my heart: The anatomy
of my thoughts would discouer a disquiet minde,
and the source of mine eies a fountaine of bitter laments.
But séeing that barrels the fuller they be the lesse sounde
they yéeld: And where the current is déepest there the water
is most still: and the minde surchargd with extreames,
hath least vtterance of grief: I leaue you to suppose of my
sorrowes which I cannot manifest. But know Lord Lentulus,
that when the report of your sickenes came to the
eares of your new intertained friends, Terentia sighed as
pitying with a common passion the ill of hir countryman,
but as one that might not relieue being intercepted with
other loues. Cornelia chid, as holding your selfe in highest
estéeme, alleaging reasons to hir that admitted no reasons,
but hir owne loue which is without reason. My selfe
sorrowed, as wishing desert shoulde haue his due, where
the honour of the man merites no lesse: we perswaded in

vaine, and in séeking to bring Terentia to the bay, we indeuoured
to quench fire with swords. Seeing then your
thoughts leuell at a wrong marke, and that no sutes can
diuert hir from hir froward conceit, in careles extreames
vse patience, wrestle with loue, beeing wrongd by loue:
yéelde not to the arrest of Cupids mace, but as he is young
so holde him a boy. Consider as Terentia is faire, so shée is
cruel: and as shée is full of fauour, so shée is too too vnkinde.
Fly not with Apollo after Daphnis: Dyana hath more
nymphes as chast, and yet not so coy: vse loue my Lentulus
as children doe puppies, which while they are pliant
and gentle they cherish vp with crummes, but when they
waxe churlish they beate away with stroakes. Thinke
Roome is the mistresse of the worlde, and hath many faire
dames, if not of such excellencie as Terentia yet are they
more curteous, and no lesse vertuous. The curious Herbalists
measure not the plants by their colours but by their
properties: the Lapidaries make estimate of their stones
not by their outward hue, but by the secrete vertues. Use
then the auncient custome of Esculapius, let lillies wither
on the stalke and weare violets in thy hand, the one faire
and vnsauorie, the other blacke but of swéete verdure. Let
these counsailes Lentulus confute thée, apply them not as
outward plastures, but as inward potions: which if they
profit, none shall be more glad then Flauia, who wisheth
if shée might in this hard extreame to discouer the honour
of hir thoughts, and the resolution of a friende: if ought
rests in me that may pleasure Lentulus, commaunde it of
Flauia, as one knowing Lentulus desires are wholy honorable.
Thus praying thou maiest haue ease in thy passions
through end of thy loues: I will offer sacrifice for thy
health as shée that feares hir owne preiudice without thy
recouery.
                  
                     Thine, Flauia of Roome.
                  
               
            
            
               No sooner had Flauia ended hir letter, but shée sealed it
and sent it away, and with as much spéede as might be, it
was conueyed to Lentulus, who reading the superscription,
and perceiuing it came from a woman, supposing it
was sent from Terentia, started vp in his bed and rent open
the s
                  •
               ales: when he had read the contents, and saw it
came from Flauia, noting the extremity of hir loue by the
plaine discouery of hir passions: he said to himselfe.
            Uniust loue that settles thy delight in crossing with
contraries. Some thou piercest with desire, other with
disdaine: infusing sundry effectes in diuers affects. I couet
Terentia and shée is cruell: Flauia fauours thée, and thou
art tyed to other loues. What restes in these extreames
but to curse fancy, that maketh such a confused chaos of
hir follyes. Oppose then reason against affection, and admitte
not of loues conclusions vnlesse they be approoued
principles Thy thoughts are deuoted to Terentia, and shée
onely vouchsafes thée the verdict of hir eares. Thou
art more honourable then shée, of richer reuenewes then
hir dowry can satisfie, hauing as many desertes as shée
hath beauties: and yet coy dame as shée is, shée twits thée
with Vesta when God wotte Venus is the goddesse that
heareth hir orisons. If thou hast this insight into hir
thoughts, why wrongs thou thy selfe with such carelesse
passions? If shée be so

Narcissus in hir beauties: Loue can chastise if it be but
with selfe loue. Use no phisicke Lentulus but the consideration
of hir frowardnesse, Let the drugs of Apollo serue for
others not for thée. Thrust out fancy by force, and setting
Terentia at light esteeme, make choice of Flauia: Though

colours that Phidias drew in his pictures, which shewing

most glorious to the eye was yet blemisht with euery
breath. Venus was faire and wanton: Helen the myracle
of Greece, but aske Troy of hir qualities. Ah but Terentia
is as chast as shée is bautifull. So is Flauia to, and farre
more louing. Hir byrth is of higher discent, hir wealth
more, hir virtues no lesse: but hir loue such as may challenge
thy affection for debt. Ah but Lentulus yet Terentia
hir excellency is more then can be shaken off with so slight
reasons: and with that he shrunke downe into his bedde,
falling to his olde complaints: yet did this letter of Flauia
somewhat comfort him, that he found it his best physicke.
But leauing him in his bed, againe to Terentia who felt
the disquiet of hir minde as restlesse. For the Senatours
daily repairing to hir fathers house, had no other table
talke but of the eloquence of Tully, some commending his
witte, other his study, some his vertues, but all his special
gifts of nature, that they put oyle into the flame: and with
these prayses so sette on fire Terentias fancy, as nothing
tumbled in hir thoughtes but the excellency of Cicero: being
so impatient as shée sought by all meanes possible to
come to his sight, and to féede hir eye with that wherwith
shée had inchanted hir eares, finding no ready way to attaine
the ende of hir desires, vntill loue that like Mercury
is full of shifts and subtlety, deuised this plot. Tully being
borne in a little village adioyning vnto Roome called Arpinatum,
vsed often to make his intercourse betwéene the
towne and the citie for his pleasure: Which Terentia hauing
learned out, thought this the fittest meanes to haue
a sight of hir Cicero. So that one day to take the aire accompanied
with hir two friends Flauia and Cornelia, hauing
but a page to attend vpon them, shée walked abroad
into the fields. Passing thus in merry chatte towards Arpinatum,
hauing some glances at the sicknes of Lentulus,
they had not walked aboue a mile before Flauia spied Tullie
comming from Arpinatum to Roome. Assoone as shée
had discried him, and for certainety knew that it was he,

yonder quoth shée comes that odde man of Roome, that
excellent Orator Marcus Tullius Cicero, so highly renowmed
through all our prouinces for his eloquence, now shal
we heare from Lentulus, for they are the most familiar
friends and priuate companions in Roome. Terentia at

               ter a curteous Salue which made Terentia blush, he began
thus to board them.
            The place swéete Romaines so aptly agréeing to the
person, this valley resembling Idas, and Rome Troy, I
cannot but bash with Paris at the sight of thrée such god

whose deitie surpassed those which iudicially y• shepharde
suruaied with his eye: Humbly therefore saluting
you as Dianas darlings and beauties woonder, séeing so
small a trayne for such excellent personages, although my
affaires be serious and of importaunce, yet please it you
to vouche of my seruice, I will attende on your walkes
and conduct you safe to Rome. Terentia féeding hir eyes
on the swéete of Tullies face, and swilling downe the nectar
of his diuine eloquence, stayning hir chéekes with
such a die, as did the fayre quéene of Cartharge courted
by Aeneas, she made him this aunswere.
            Howe you make compare Cicero of this valley with
the plaines of Troy as little skilled in Geographie or red

Tullie aboue all the rest: And why so quoth Terentia? because
quoth Tullie the least

               lie hath his spleane the smallest
ant her gall, no haire so little but he hath his shadowe,
and no man so meane but he hath his enuie: Why then
quoth Terentia I will discarde you from the office of Paris
as a man partiall. But I pray thée Cicero wherein
shoulde I offende thée hauing neuer séene thée before? In
this quoth hée that Lentulus hath séene you: with that she
blusht, and Flauia and Cornelia fell into a great laughter,
that Tullie had so roughly crost hir ouer the thumbs.
Tullie prosecuting his purpose went forwarde thus. For
knowe madam that Lentulus the richest Trophee that
fortune settes vp in the Theator of honour made shipwracke
of his libertie for the report of your beautie, leauing
the wars and the great hope of his fortunes to haue
a sight of Terentia, who vnkinde not like Venus in curtesie,
though in fauours; haue counterpoysde his fancie
with mis

haue powred him downe heapes of bitter and displeasing
gall. The crueltie of Cresida neuer amated so the hardy
Troilus as the frowne of Terentia hath pierst Lentulus,
making so déepe a wound as no phisicke can cure onely
your swéete selfe, whose resolutions are so farre from the
properties of your face, as it séemes the gods wrongd nature
in placing an adamant heart within a christall couerture.
The Ladies hearing Tully so sharpe, bitte the lip
and Terentia grieued: angry shée coulde not be as one that
was ouer the shooes in affection, but thus shee cutte him
off.

               k the blowes as wel as Alexander, &amp; think nothing ill

that is spoken from Diogenes. Howsoeuer or whatsoeuer
Cynicke or stoicke, I argue thus against Lentulus, that
vowes made to Vesta are to be holden inuiolated, and resolutions
to liue a virgine are not to be broken with marriage.
Cornelia and Flauia hearing them thus farre in by
the eares, walked a little aside and left Tully to schoole Terentia:
who maintained hir arguments thus. Suppose
Tully it were not chast thoughts but newe loues that forced
me to this refusal: haue not trées their strings &amp; womē
their fancies and affections? If his autum showers comming
too late cause not his crops to proue, what is that to
me? Loue consisteth in vnity: the heart hath but one
string, the heauen one sunne, and the Iris one property,
and women but one loue: and that I tell thée Tully, is placed
on one that is as famous for his vertues as Lentulus
for his wealth and dignities. And what then can I giue,
or he rightly challenge? Tully although hee conceiued in
his thoughtes that Terentia yéelded great reason, yet hée
would not giue ouer the chase so, but made this reply. Ah
but madame haue an insight into the depth of his affections,
howe he aimes not at your treasures hoping to be inriched
by your great dowry, For Lentulus is of the welthiest
family in Roome: but leuels at your vertues, the
syrens against whom he could not vse Vlisses pollicy. If
affections be but a little past, if loue hath but drawne one
line in your thoughts with his pensell: wrastle with fansie,
blot out loues shadowes, and helpe Lentulus: who if
you remaine so cruell shall be no more Lentulus. If he dye
for loue, how shall the stréetes swarme with statues of his
constancy? If you be knowen the chiefe actor of the tragedy,
how will the people murmure of your cruelty? Weigh
this madame, I speake as a familiar of Lentulus, and no
enemy to Terentias honour. If he be a Romaine that Terentia
loues, let him either be more honourable, more valiant,
more affable, more excellent euery way then Lentulus,
nay more louing then the poore gentleman, or else discarde

him for a man insufficient either to tast of Terentias
beauty, or to be corriual with Lentulus in his loues. Terentia
had yéelded at this fierce assault, had not loue laide
an instance before hir of hir resolution. For the more Tully
pleaded for his friend, the more was Terentia enamoured:
so that shée made him this answere.
            If I knewe howe to certifie Lentulus of this dayes discourse,
he should highly reward you for playing so wel the
Orator. But I maruaile Cicero that being young, and of
such eloquence, we heare not of your loues: I feare you
reach so hye, that you thinke no maides in Roome honorable
inough for your paramour. Were I a man and had
Tullies grace, and his tongue, I would plead for my selfe:
and vse one word for my friend, and two for my selfe. So
madame (quoth he) shoulde men account mee a faithlesse
friend, and a flattering louer. But leauing these suppositions
madam, how answere you my last reason? With loue
quoth shée and that is without reason, for how might the
gentleman to whom I finde my selfe affectionate, thinke
himselfe wrongd if without cause I should be inconstant.
Graunt I my loue to the meanest citizen, a monarch shall
not make conquest of my thoughts. Suppose syr it were
your selfe, and that Terentia loued Tully, coulde you brooke
an other to braue you in your affections. I would madame
quoth Tully if it were no supposition. And how then quoth
Terentia if it were not? Then would I quoth hee become
Esculapius to Lentulus, and sweare his disease shoulde not
be incurable, for I woulde coniure you by the rightes of
loue, by the sacred lawes of Venus, and by the affection
that were imprinted in your thoughtes, to bestowe what
y
                  •
               u would impart vpon me to my only ioy Lord Lentulus.
But women cannot make loue voluntary. Tush madame
what cannot women doe for loue? Any thing quoth Terentia
but change loue. Therefore concealing the party that
I loue, I will say and sweare Tully is my loue, and so say
to Lentulus. With this Terentia blusht, and for very griefe

that Tully woulde not sée into hir thoughtes the teares
stoode in hir eies: which Tully spying, it so prickt him to the
heart, that it neuer after was rased out. To smooth therefore
his rough methode with a fewe fine filed phrases, hee
salued the matter thus. It is madame impossible to driue
fire downeward, or to make heauy things to mount: Nature
will not bee wrongd, nor loue drawne out by constraint,
therfore I will leaue any more at this time to sue
for Lentulus: hoping the consideration of his martirdome
will at length make battery into the bulwarke of your
breast, &amp; whereas you will sweare Tully is your l
                  •
               ue: you

                twelue tables a lawe against
periury, but if you vouch to grace me that title, in
all duty I wil rest your euer bounden seruant. Why then
seruant quoth shée, let vs to yonder two Ladies, that for
want of a companion are faine to make an amarous
knight of my page. Flauia séeing they were halfe agréed,

                  •
               earing Tully by his eloquence had perswaded Terentia,
waxed pale and incountred them thus. What news quoth
shée, doth Lentulus winne or loose? Neither madame quoth
Tully but his cause hanges still in suspence, the next court
day I will end my oration, and then the Iudge shall giue
verdict. As they were ready to haue gone forward in some
pleasant prattle they espied a horseman making towards
them with the greatest spéede that might bee. When he
came within ken, Tully knew it to be Lentulus man, and
before he had leysure to do his message, he demanded how
his master did: passing sicke syr quoth hee, and hath sent
that you be with him presently. Tully who was toucht at
the quicke with this newes, put foote in the stirrop and
mounted, yet as one forgetting himselfe hee vsed these
words. Pardon Ladies, if I passe manners and promise,
in leaping vp without leaue, and returning in such post
without your company: It is for Lentulus whom you all
loue, and therefore I hope to rest blamelesse. Now madam
Terentia what shall I say to Lentulus? No more quoth shée

then what I saide to Tullie, but how concludes Tullie of
his last premisses? that quoth hee, Terentia shall frame
the argument, and so with this darke Aenigma he tooke
leaue of the Ladies: who after his departure fell in talke
of his perfections. Terentia so déepely praysing the man
that hir companions easilie perceiued hir loues, &amp; smilde
that in forsaking a flower shée light vpon a wéede. Well
tracing still amongst the medows they chanced into a valley
most curiouslie decked with Floras delicates, in which
were such varietie of flowers, that nature séemed there
to haue planted the storehouse of hir prodigalitie. Adioyning
to this valley was a pleasaunt riuer and a groue
that gaue a grace to Cloris excellencie: delighted with the
scituation of this place, as they passed along they met
                  •
               e
a shéepheard, who doing reuerence to the dames: Terentia
demaunded of this swaine what the name of this pleasaunt
place was. Madam quoth he we shéepehardes here
call it the vale of Loue, And why so quoth Cornelia? Although
madam quoth he my flocke hath no guide but my
dog, and now in yeaning time the wolues are verie busie,
yet for that I see you are Senators daughters, and with
all passing courteous I will shew the reason, and with
that leaning on his staffe the Ladies sitting downe he began
thus.
            
               
                  
                     
                        The Sheepheardes tale.
                        NOt many yeares since here in Arpynatū
                            dwelt a shepherdise
called Phillis, so famous for hir beauty that the
Senators sonnes which you cal Pretextati not only came
to féed their eyes with hir fauours but to satifie their fancies
with hir loues: in so much that she was courted of
manie braue Romaine Gentlemen. But shee that helde
loue at the staffes end, although hir parentes had left hir
rich, yet to banishe Cupid with labour she vouchsaft to be

kéeper of hir owne flockes, fearing the pride of the beautie
(if s

                           e should marrie with one of Rome) would proue an
enimie to hir humble thoughtes: Liuing as chast as shée
was inrouled for a Vestall, and quoted by Diana for one
of hir speciall followers, hir excellencie was bruted abroad
through all Italie. But shee who feared to gase at
starres, for stumbling at stones laide hir thoughtes lowe
and made choice of hir companie with countrie maydes,
and homely shepehards: yet was hir attire rich as diuers
that traueled this way tooke hir rather for a Nymphe the
follower of some goddesse, then a maide and daughter of a
poore swaine. While thus she liued ladie of the field, there
was in the same village one Coridon, sonne to a simple
shéepeharde who as a Mercinarie man kept shéepe for Vatinius
the Senator, that hath a Farme hard by. This Coridon
was a man of a pe

If he pipt, Apollo was not like hir Pan, if hee sung hys
voyce was without compare, if he tolde tales they were
excellent, if put foorth riddles they were wittie. Coridon
was the shéepehard that Phillis did fancie, and no flockes
might grase by hirs but those of Coridon. This mistris
can loue do, who thought he be choisly honoured in Rome,
yet he finds some idle time to dallie amongst shéepehards.
Well at last Coridon spyed Phillis lookes and got some
hope of fauour, first hee courted with his eyes, and after
natures law fell to prattle with interchange of glaunces,
after from lookes to wordes, which after their homely fashion
was verie faithfully performed with sighs &amp; teares,
such perswasions as shéepehardes vse. Long had they
not wooed, but Phillis was willing and she was won, that
after faith and troth as soone as the shéepehards coulde
come together a feast was made we kept holiday and they
were married, and because these louers made this place
the concealer of their passions the shéepehardes for perpetuall
memorie of Phillis and Coridon call this the vale of
Loue, and in praise thereof we countrie shéephards made
an Ode, which if it please you to stay I will rehearse. The
Ladies passing willing, thus the shephearde gan report.

                           Niggard seemd in other places.
                           Spring it was and here did spring,
                           All that nature forth can bring:
                           Groues of pleasant trees there grow,
                           Which fruit and shadowe could bestow.
                           
                              Thick leaued boughes small birds couer,
                           Till sweete notes themselues discouer:
                           Tunes for number seemed confounded,
                           Whilst their mixtures musicke sounded.
                           Greeing well, yet not agreed,
                           That one the other should exceede.
                           A sweete streame here silent glides,
                           Whose cleare water no fish hides.
                           Slow it runs which well bewraid,
                           The pleasant shore the current staid:
                           In this streame a rocke was planted,
                           Where nor art nor nature wanted.
                           Each thing so did other grace,
                           As all places may giue place.
                           Onely this the place of pleasure,

                           From departing were withheld.
                           Musing then with sound aduise,
                           On this earthly paradise:
                           Sitting by the riuer side,
                           Louely Phillis was discride;

                           Like to Phoebus in his shine.
                           White hir brow, hir face was faire,
                           Amber breath perfumde the aire.
                           Rose and Lilly both did seeke,
                           To shew their glories on hir cheeke.
                           Loue did nestle in hir lookes,
                           Baiting there his sharpest hookes.
                           Such a Phillis nere was seene,

                           Doubt it was whose greater grace,
                           Phillis beauty or the place.
                           
                              Hir coate was of scarlet red,
                           All in pleates a mantle spred:
                           Fringd with gold, a wreath of bowes,
                           To check the sunne from hir browes.
                           In hir hand a shepheards hooke,
                           In hir face Dianas looke:
                           Hir sheepe grased on the plaines,
                           Shee had stolne from the swaines.
                           Vnder a coole silent shade,
                           By the streames shee garlands made.
                           Thus sate Phillis all alone,
                           Mist shee was by Coridon
                           Chiefest swaine of all the rest,
                           Louely Phillis like him best.
                           His face was like Phoebus loue,
                           His necke white as Venus Doue,
                           A ruddy cheeke filde with smiles,
                           Such loue hath when he beguiles.
                           His locks browne, his eies were gray,
                           Like Titan in a sommer day.
                           A russet Iacket sleeues red,
                           A blew bonnet on his hed:
                           A cloake of gray fencst the raine,
                           Thus tyred was this louely swaine.
                           A shepheards hooke his dog tide,
                           Bag and bottle by his side:
                           Such was Paris shepheards say,
                           When with Oenone he did play.
                           From his flocke straid Coridon,
                           Spying Phillis all alone:
                           By the streame he Phillis spide,
                           Brauer then was Floras pride.
                           Downe the valley gan he tracke,
                           Stole behinde his true loues backe:
                           The sunne shone and shadow made,
                           Phillis rose and was afraid.
                           
                              When shee saw hit louer there,
                           Smile shee did and left hir feare:
                           Cupid that disdaine doth loth,
                           With desire strake them both.
                           The swaine did wooe shee was nise,
                           Following fashion nayed him twise:
                           Much adooe he kist hir then,
                           Maidens blush when they kisse men:
                           So did Phillis at that stowre.
                           Hir face was like the rose flowre.
                           Last they greed for loue would so,
                           Faith and troth they would no mo.
                           For shepheards euer held it sin,
                           To false the loue they liued in.
                           The swaine gaue a girdle red,
                           Shee set garlands on his hed.
                           Gifts were giuen they kisse againe,
                           Both did smile for both were faine.
                           Thus was loue mongst shepheards solde,
                           When fancy knew not what was golde:
                           They woed &amp; vowed, &amp; that they keep,
                           And goe contented to their sheep.
                        
                        The ende of the shepheards Ode.
                     
                  
               
            
            ASsoone as the shepeharde repeated his Ode, Terentia
delighted with the description of the pastorall loue for
that it touched hir passions gaue him heartie thankes
and so the swaine tooke his leaue and departed. Terentia
and the rest hereupon growing into the effectes of loue
that kéepes no proportion of persons, wandring on
talking towardes the groue. And for that the sun
                  •
               e
grewe hote and was risen to the highest zenith of the heauens,
seeking for shelter they went into the groue which
was seated hard by the pleasant current, finding out there

a place conuenient, these thrée Ladies 
                  •
               it them downe vpon
the grasse, where delighted with the melodie of the
birdes, and the c
                  ••
               lenesse of the shade they fell a sléepe.
Then liued in Rome Vatinus y• Senator which was one
of the most wealthie in possessions of any that had béene
consull in the Citie, fauoured euery way by fortune, had
he not beene thwarted by one gréeuous &amp; dolefull misfortune.
For this Vatinius amongst manie children had his
eldest sonne as first in byrth, so brauest in proportion, of
such exquisite lyneaments touching the outwarde shape,
as nature séemed to haue béene curious in hir workmanshippe:
but otherwise hee was so foolish and of clownish
capacitie that there was no hope of his future conceipt,
his name was after his father Vatinius. But for because
neither by the diligence of anie maister, nor the flattery of
his friendes, correction, or anie other industrie he coulde
bee made capable of learning or ciuilitie, vsing fashions
and woordes from a harshe and grosse voyce, reresembling
rather a bruite beast then a reasonable creature,
he was in derision called of euery man Fabius the
Foole. Vatinius gréeuing that the gods had offered him
this wronge for that the presence of Fabius was the continuall
source of his sorrowes, hée commanded that hee
shoulde goe to his Farme, and there liue amongst his
shepheards. This was no little content to Fabius as one
that delighted more in the nature of Clownes and bondslaues
then in the courtly behauior of libertines &amp; gentlemen.
Fabius thus being in the countrie applying himselfe
to all principles of husbandrie, one day amongst the rest
walked foorth with a great batte on his necke to ouer-sée
his fathers pastures, at last for y• the Sunne was hie and
shone hote, he went into the groue then all ouerclad with
leaues, for it was far spring, and féeling a place wherein
at pleasure to rest himselfe, hee stumbled by fortune on
the fount where Terentia lay a sléepe, who when Fabius
espied being clad in a robe of Bisse so thinne as the whitenes

of hir skinne did appeare, hauing hir two companions
by hir side, he began as one amazed to beholde. Leaning
therefore on his great batte without vttring one worde,
he stood in great admiration what she should be, as though
he had neuer séene so braue a creature before. Nowe entring
into his rusticall and blunt vnderstanding (where
neuer before could be ingrauen any impression of honest
ciuilitie a thought of fancie which made him confesse in
his grosse and materiall spirits that this mayde was the

                  •
               airest thing y• euer could be censured by sight. In this humour
he began to descant of hir seuerall beauties, praysing
hir hayre to be of gold, hir forehead of Iuorie, hir lips

                  •
               oral, &amp; aboue all hir two breasts which then began to appeare
like pretie tender buddes, in such simple sort so distinguishing
of hir fauours that from a grosse clowne hee
became to be a Iudge of Beautie: especially coueting to
sée hir eyes which heauie sléepe had shut vp, determining
often to haue waked hir to haue contented himselfe with
their sight. But séeing hir more faire then any creature
that before he had séene, he thought hir to bee some Goddesse.
Hauing thus farre knowledge that things deuine
should be reuerenced more then humaine, and therefore
durst not attempe to wake hir, but (although shée had a
sounde and long sléepe) tooke such pleasure in contemplating
hir perfections that he would by no delay depart. At
last after a longe space Terentia awaked before any of
the rest, lifting vp hir drowsie eyes shee sawe before hir
Fabius leaning vpon his staffe, whereof béeing halfe amazed
shée asked of him. Fabius, what séekest thou here in
this groue? Fabius who as well by his countenance as
clemencie and for the nobilitie of his house, as the riches
of his father, was generally knowne of all the Romains,
made no answere to Terentia: but séeng hir eyes open he
began to looke stedfastly vpon them féeling a pleasing content
to issu
                  •
                from those Lampes which sparkle as the verie
flames of loue: insomuch that Terentia séeing him gase

so earnestly fearing the sturdie clowne might offer hir
some violence wakened hir companions and starting vp
said Fabius farwell. To whome Fabius made aunswere
I will goe with you. And although Terentia refused as
being surprised with great fear of his rustical disposition,
yet he would not forsake hir till he had brought hir to hir
Fathers house, where bluntly leauing the Ladie he went
home to his Fathers; saying hee woulde not returne ani
                  •
               
more into the countrie. Although it gréeued his Father to
haue his sorrowe cōtinually before his eies, yet wondring
what ye occasiō of this strange motiō should mean, he was
content to let him remaine at home in the Citie. Loues
arrowes thus piercing into the heart of Fabius whereinto
neuer before any ciuill thought could enter, made such
a Metamorphosis of his minde that not onely his Fath
                  •
               r
&amp; friends, but all Roome began to woonder at his sodaine
alteration: for he required to be apparelled as the sonne
of a Senator which his father with all diligence performed,
then frequenting the most courteous and honest
young Gentlemen of the Citie, especially such as were
amorous, he to the great astonishig of all not onely learned
his letters, but became verie studious, grew to haue
déepe insight into philosophie, to be skilfull in musicke, to
ride a horse and to be expert in all gentle and manlike actiuitie,
to conclude in short space he was one of the brauest
young men of Rome.
            
            Here by the way courteous Ladies and braue gentlemen
what shal I say of the transformatiō of Fabius? onely
in my opiniō this: That y• high vertues of the heauens
infused into his noble brest were imprisoned by y• enuious
wrath of Fortune within some narrowe corner of his
heart, whose bandes went a sunder by loue, as a Lord to
mightie for fortune. Cupid the raiser vp of sléepy thoughts
dispersed those vertues into euery part of his mind obscured
before with the eclipse of base thoughts. Let vs then
think of loue as of the most purest passion that is inserted

into the heart of man. Well, leauing Fabius studious how
to excell in all laudable vertues, againe to Tullie, who arriued
in post haste to the lodging of Lentulus and founde
him passing sicke, yet somewhat comforted at the sight of
Cicero, as of him y• he held most déere in the world. Tullie
séeing him so ill &amp; full of passiōs durst not tel him y• he had
seene Terentia least hir froward answere should augment
his miserie, concealing therfore his chat y• he had with y•
Ladies, at last Lentulus shewed him the letter of Flauia:
whereupon they fell to discourse of hir beauties and vertues,
howe she was not much inferiour to Terentia in fauour,
but farre beyond hir in honours, discoursing so long
from point to point that after a vole of broken sighes tempered
with some teares hée fell a sléepe. Tullie glade that
he tooke a nappe stole softly out of the Chamber, and being
by himselfe calling to minde the words of Terentia began
to enter into this combate with himselfe.
            So pliant are the aspectes of the foreappointing stars
in some mens natiuitie as they force fortune mauger hir
owne variable nature to bee constant. Amongst all that
haue béene borne in the poore village of Arpinatum, thou
maist Tullie say that thy planets haue béene pleasing, and
thy desires fauorable, who the son of a poore Fermour art
in hope to make thy house equal with the most in Roome.
Measure but thy honour and Iudge of thy fortunes: thy
family base, yet art thou companion with Senators and
men of grauest account in the Citie. Honour treades on
thy héele and dignitie daunceth attendance at thy lookes:
but loue Cicero, that deitie, that diuine essence that sealeth
vp content in al estates he stoopeth at thy frown, presentes
thée wreaths of myrtle that thou maist enter into
Paphos without checke. Terentia the wonder of Rome,
Natures Paragon, the refined beautie of the heauens, she
that seemeth to glaunce on the Pretextati: she that makes
no account of the miracle of our time, Lord Lentulus: shée
Cicero commaunded by loue, yéelds hir selfe captiue to the

sonne of a poore country villager in Arpinatum. Then Tullie
strew Venus temple with roses, say there is no fount
but Alcydalion: no hill but Erecinus: no bird but the doue:
no god but Cupid. Loose not oportunity, take hir by the
foreheade, let not slip occasion, for shée glydes away like a
shadow, nor loue, for she hangs at the héeles at time. Nowe
Terentia hath put the iron in the fire, strike then while it
is hot, pay hir downe poundes of loue for drams of fancy,
for in matching wt the daughter of a senator, think it presageth
thou shalt be a Senator: so shalt thou gaine at one
time honour, dignity, wealth, and beauty; but with that
loose thy faith Tully, thy faith thou hast vowed to Lentulus,
who shuts vp his secretes in thy heart, and resteth his
thoughts on thy bosome. Wilt thou preferre honour before
thy friend, or wealth before conscience. Ah Tully if thou be
the man y• 
               Roome woondreth at for thy eloquence, be also
the man that they shall canonize for thy vertues. Beauty
is but a bauins blaze, wealth is but a fickle fauour of
fortune, dignity is haunted by enuy: but friendship that
is the pretious treasure that neither time nor fortune
can violate. Why but Terentia will neuer loue Lentulus,
then Tully hate thou euer Terentia. I am
a man and subiect vnto loue as well as Lentulus: So art
thou a man and being false to thy friend art vnworthy all
loue. Abandon Tully these vaine imaginations, 
                  •
               ount Terentia
foule, deformed, vitious and what not, as long as
one sparke of loue lieth rakt vp in the cynders of thy
thoughts: and as long as Lentulus loues hir, hate hir for
thy self, and 
                  •
               oue hir for Lentulus. Setting downe his rest
at this period, he went into the chamber to sée if Lentulus
were awake, but finding him still fast a sléepe, he went towards
the Capitoll, where he met with Flaminius the father
of Terentia who demaunded very heartily how Lentulus
did. Cicero with a déepe sigh said passing sick. Wherof
quoth Flaminius grows the disease, I heard that Asclapo
iudgeth his sickenes to be mortall. Tully thinking to set
all on the dice, not respecting his owne loue but his faith

to his friend, began thus. Graue Senator, I néede not rehearse
Lentulus byrth, as beeing a citizen, nor his reuenewes,
his possessions long knowne to euery man, nor his
honours ended in victories, for the Parthians are sufficient
euidence of his well discharged dignities and valour. Lentulus
graced in the prime of his youth with these fauours,
hearing of the beauty of a Romaine Lady, left the warres
and came to Roome, where courting his mistresse not
with wanton poemes, but with tearmes of marriage: hee
f
                  •
               und hir froward, and his loue dasht in the prime. The
impression of hir beauty grauen with too déepe a caracter
was too fast rooted in his heart to be thrust out with deniall:
yet Lentulus to content hir, plaies like the phenix,
burnes in his owne parfumes, rather wishing to die then
to contrary hir resolution. This is the cause that first
brought Lentulus to his bedde, and this ere long will bring
him to his graue. And who may it be quoth Flaminius, of
what family, of what beauty, of what degrée, that can
or dare deny Lorde Lentulus? Is he not mighty and may
commaund by force, what he cannot obtaine by intreaty?
will not the souldiers at his becke rise in armes? Feare not
the Consuls themselues to wrong Lentulus? Doth not all
Roome hang their thoughts at his lookes? Ah miserable
father that harbours such a daughter, and stubborne huswife
that denies so braue a Romaine. In friendship Tully
tell me who it is. Cicero willing to put a spurre to a frée
horse, and to loose his owne content to winne his friendes
quiet, told him flatly it was his daughter Terentia: and for
proofe he shewed him the letters that past betwixt Lentulus
and hir. Assoone as hir father had read the contents, as
a man half mad he fel into furious and frantick tearmes,
exclaiming against the headstrong humour of foolish Terentia.
After he had breathd out the heat of his choller, he
fell to be somewhat appeased, and bad Tully home to supper,
promising all shoulde sort according vnto Lentulus
minde. With that departing from the Capitoll, Tully and

he went home to his house, where the Cooke being somewhat
slacke: Flaminius hearing his daughter was all alone
in the garden, he wished Tully to try hir once againe,
and to perswade hir by all possible means to graunt to the
request of Lentulus. Upon this Tully went into the garden
where finding Terentia sitting solitary in an arbour vp to
the hard eares in a dumpe, he wakened hir out of hir muse
thus. Vestas chiefe paragon, and Venus newe interteined
darling, you madam Terentia I meane, that sit in a muse:
are you offring orisons to Diana for your chastity, or
thanks to Cupid for your loues: or what are you thinking
on when you thinke on nothing? Terentia turning hir
head and séeing Tully all alone, blusht more then Cynthia
did when shée wantond it with hir faire faced shepheard,
yet welcomming hir loue with a smile, shée tooke him by
the hand and made him this answere.
            Your subtile salutation concluding Vesta and Venus in
one Dilemma commands me answere that I was dooing
my deuotion to both, offring prayers for my olde thoughts
&amp; thanks for my newe loues: &amp; scarce had I saide gramercy
to the goddesse, but you must come Cicero to make my
thanks prodigious: for my thinking when I thought of
nothing it was of mens loues which are lighter then the
flame, and sooner faded then a flash of lightning: But I
pray you say what winde hath driuen you into this coast.
            Marry madame the very sighes that fly from Lentulus
breast grewe to so great a storme that I was blowne
hither to séeke shelter for the tempest. You haue nothing
quoth Terentia but Lentulus in your mouth: I pray you say
how fares the gentleman? Ill madame quoth Tully euery
way, for his dyet is badde in that his stomacke is nought,
and his health is doubtfull in that his thoughtes are disquiet:
and madame it rests in you to saue so honourable a
gentleman not onely from sickenes but from sorrowe: Aeneas
was a stragling Troian an exile periured and banisht
euen from the ruines of Troy, yet Dydo the famous Carthage
               
quéene made him hir paramour. Demophoon a pyrat
a robber in Greece cast vp as shipwrack on the shore,
yet interteind by Phillis. Phao a ferryman, a slaue, yet fauoured
by Sapho. Lentulus the hope of the Romains, more
beautifull then Eneas, more couragious th
                  •
                
               Demophoon,
more honourable then Phao, more louing then them all, is
refused and reiected by Terentia, his neighbour and familiar.
Thinke not Terentia but loue as hee hath roses so hee
hath nettles, as he hath perfumes so hath hee hemblocke,
and holding fauors the claspeth reuenge, as ready to pierce
as to pacifi
                  •
               . If you procure Lentulus death, Cupid hath
power to inforce your dispaire, and to cause your loue to be
as fickle to you as you are froward to him. Then madam
let me be the messenger of life, and from your swéete selfe
carry such conserues to Lentulus as may recouer his
health and increase your honours. This discourse of Tully
did but sette Terentias heart more on fire. For hearing the
pleasant harmony of hir Cicero, shée likt of the musicke
as of the Syrens melody, and so intangled hir selfe with
many newe conceiued fancies, insomuch that forgetting
whose daughter shée was, shée burst foorth into these
tearmes.
            Did I not Cicero tell thée twixt Arpinatum &amp; Roome, y•
loue hath but one cell wherein to place the Idaea of y• party
loued: wilt thou haue me like the Camelion to haue many
colours, or like Helena to intertain many loues? I know
Lentulus dignities are beyond my degrée, that his honors
are more then my fortunes, that his loue is great, and so
I holde him the second in my most secrete thoughtes: first
he cannot be and that he craues. Thou doest wring water
out of the flint, fier forth of y• dry sandes, &amp; immodesty from
hir that hath euer béene honoured for chastily: so that by
wastlesse perswasions for thy friende, I am forst to say
thou art the friend that Terentia hath chosen amongst all
the worthy Romains: Before I sawe thée Tully I loued
thee, and now I haue setled my affection, and thou wrongst

me with discurtesie: but either cease from intreating for
Lentulus, or looke to sée me worse then Lentulus. And with
this blushing at hir owne ouermuch loues, shée poured
foorth such abundance of teares, as well might bew
                  •
               ay
the sincerity of hir affections. Tully gréeuing to sée the
goddesse of his thoughtes in this passion answered hir,
mildly thus. Blame me not Terentia if I pleade for Lentulus,
séeing his sorrow, and entring into mine owne promise.
Then friendship is no swéeter iewell, then howe can
I but labour ere I loose so rich a prize. But séeing Terentia
hath vouchsafed of so meane a man as Tully, whose honours
onely hanges in his studies: loue béeing the strictest
league of amity and no such friendship as is mariage:
I vowe by the Romaine gods, euer to be a duetifull seruant
vnto a Terentia: and with my loyalty so to requite hir
fauours, as Roome shall more admire my affections then
they haue woondred at my eloquence: yet with this prouiso
(my swéete Terentia) that although I preferre thy fauours
before mine owne life, yet if thou canst striue to
loue Lentulus, which if either the gods, loue, fortune, or thy
selfe can bring to passe, I will with mine owne preiudice
conquer mine owne thoughtes to satisfie the content of
Lentulus. As Terentia was ready to reply, one of hir fathers
seruants came to request Cicero to come to supper,
who taking his leaue of Terentia went in to hir father
Flaminius, who sitting downe to supper, passed away the
time in ordinary talke. Their repast being taken, Flaminius
calling Tully on the one side, demaunded what his
daughters answere was. Peremptory quoth Tully still to
hold Lentulus in mislike. Then you shall heare quoth hir
father what I will say, and so report to Lentulus: so calling
for Terentia they thrée being together, he began thus.
            I knowe not howe Terentia to insinuate my exordium,
whether friendly to perswade with a smyle, or fatherly to
admonish with a frowne: thy follies are so great, and my
care so tender. Roome hath hitherto admyred thy vertues,

and I haue praised thy obedience: thou hast béene counted
honorable and chast, wise to eschew wantonnesse, but neuer
coy to be thought disdainefull: and shall nowe all these
graces ende in disgrace? Then Terentia maiest thou repent
hereafter, and I powre forth present sorrowes. I
speake thus, for that I heare in the city what maketh
me to grieue, and may force thée to blush. They say
Terentia is beautiful and proude, witty and ouerwéening,
hauing coy disdaine crept into the place of curteous desire:
this men say that enuy thy follyes, and grieue at Lentulus
fortunes. Now daughter thou séest the marke I aime
at, and maiest iudge of my shot by the leuell: Lentulus is
fallen into a feuer, which Asclapo that famous Phisition
of Patras censures to be mortall. Thy frowardnes was
the efficient of the disease, and nowe thou deniest cure of
the maladie. Unaduised gyrle, that neither weighest of
thine owne honours, nor his miseries. Lentulus requires
Terentia in mariage: let vs make compare of the parties,
and so examine the cause of thy denials. He is descended
from the Lentuli and Aemilij, two houses that euer haue
béene the props of the Romaine dignities. His honours
are great, as proconsul in his youth against the Parthians:
His fortunes mighty, doubled with his conquests and victories:
His reuenewes such as he may with Crassus
maintaine Legions. If like Venus darling thou séekest to
féede thine eie, his fauour is more then his that pleased
Cynthia. If thou couetest a souldier, Lentulus in Roome
is as Hector was in Troy. If a Courtier, who braues it so
in Italy? To conclude if Terentia couet to loue, there is
none so fit to loue within the Romaine Empire as Lentulus.
Whereas Terentia is but the daughter of a meane
Senatour, hir dowry cannot be much, for that hir fathers
wealth is not great: Beautifull shée is, and so are many in
Roome, who are of meaner parentage. Hir glories are
but fortunes pelfe, that florishe in the morning, and fade
before night. What then can mooue Terentia to oppose hir

selfe against Lentulus? vnlesse shée fatally presageth hir
owne discredit, and the ruine of hir fathers house. If then
daughter thou art child to Flaminius, I charge thée by the
strickt law of nature, which Philosophers call Regius amor
a kingly loue, if thou be a maide, by the holy fiers of
Vesta: if beautifull, by Venus deity: if a Romaine, by thy
Countryes loue, that thou loue Lentulus: which if thou refuse
to performe, thy father shall curse thée, Vesta shall
shut thée from hir temples, Venus from hir fauours, and
thy country from inioying the swéete content of honour,
and then make thée outcast of all the Romaine virgines.
More are my reasons to alleage, then thy reasons able to
contrary: but omitting all and saying he is onely Lentulus:
Daughter what answere?
            
               Terentia séeing hir father in such a choller, and that hée
was induced vnto it by Ciceros perswasiōs in a furie began
thus frantike. I not denie but Fathers challenge
loue by nature and obedience by duetie, and both those sir
I hope I haue euer performed, if not I rest sorrowfull &amp;
hartily craue pardon: but in loue parentes haue no priuiledge.
For the liking of the Father is no contract of the
daughter. Venus conclusions growe not of parentes pr
                  •
               
               mises,
nor can affection bee like the fire stroken foorth a
flint, for loue is chosen by the eye and confirmed by the
heart, womens thoughtes are not the spoyles of Mars,
nor is the battell of fancie fought with the sworde, but
with the Senses, &amp; loues arrowes are pointed by fate and
fortune. Weigh then Terentia, who hath not hir loues in
hir hande but in hir heart and thereinto none can make
breach, but such a one as the pleasing constellation of the
stars haue appointed. I not denie the excellencie of Lentulus
as well in exterior shewe of honours, wealth, dignities,
and proportion, as in interior vertues &amp; perfections
of the minde, and that he merittes a Ladie of farre more
estéeme then Terentia, but I knowe not what contrarie
aspect either of the planets in our natiuities, or of loues

in our thoughtes, or of fortune in our resolution 
                  •
               o like,
hath crossed his desire and my fancie, but of all the Romayne
Gentlemen I cannot my Lorde fancie Lentulus.
Cressida confest Troylus was the better knight, &amp; yet the
Gréeke helde hir louely in his tent. Sith then affection
growes from desire, and desire is tyed to destinie, séeke
not sir to wring water out of the pumex, to couple the
Mouse and the Elephant at one stall, to vnite those loues
that Venus in hir Sinod house hath expreslie countercheckt.
For to aunswere your obiection, Terentia cannot
force hir self to loue Lentulus. Shée thus concluding with
a few teares, hir father departing from hir with a frown,
tolde Tullie that not reason was sufficient to induce his
daughter to be affectionate, and therefore that hee wished
Lentulus to appease his passions and to salue such impossibilities
with patience, wherupon they after interchange
of salutations and cōmon courtesies parted with a friendlie
farewell. Tullie at his home comming reuealed
vnto Lentulus the whole discourse howe Flaminius had
searcht into the depth of Terentias thoughtes both with
plawsible perswasions and inforced reasons, and coulde
finde no other conclusion but that shée could not loue Lentulus.
Although this newes pierced the verie center of
his heart as mortallie as if hee had béene wounded with
the sting of Aspis: yet chéering himselfe a little he sat vp
and in his owne minde hauing aboute or two with fancie,
he gaue hir so deepe a reuie that hee held affection at
the swordes point. But Tullie who betwéene friendship
and loue felt a furious combate, allured with the beauteous
perfection of Terentia, and forbidden that fauour by
the entyre amitie hee had vowed vnto Lentulus: entred
into so déepe a melancholie that not able to master his passions,
he fell sicke and kept his bed. Lentulus séeing hys
Tullie thus distrest gréeued at his friends misfortune, and
chéered vp himselfe that hee might somewhat comfort his
Cicero that newlie was crossed with a distempered sickenesse.

He sought by physicke to search out the nature of the
disease, but Asclapo could not déeme the cause by the effectes,
he sought by intreaties to wrest out the occasion
of so sodayne a sorrow, but in vayne, Tullie was too secrete
and silent to make anie shewe of his loues though he
bought such secresie with death. This gréeued Lentulus
who féeling himselfe euery day to amend, perceiued that
Cicero daylie waxed worse and worse. Lingring thus in
inward passions, Terentia that tooke it discourteously at
Tullies hande that hee should force hir Father to inforce
hir to loue Lentulus, séeing shée had onely deuoted hirselfe
as his, howsoeuer fortune shoulde oppose hir selfe; to ease
hir mind of some choller that boiled in hir secret thoughts
shée tooke penne and inke and wrote him a letter to this
effect.
            
               
                  Terentia to Marcus Tullius
Cicero health.
                  AS my thoughtes are secrete and my loues extréeme, so
is vnkindenesse bitter and the more vneasie borne.
Thou playest Tullie with me, as doe the Leopards with
there kéeper; that euer wrong them most that giue them
greatest store of fodder. Are these Venus lawes to pay
hunnie with Gall, to make rods of nettles for Garlands
of Roses, to hate them most that loue most. The ingratitude
of Tullie hath drawen Terentia into this choller, and
if I write sharpely blame me not that am vsed so shrowdlie.
Before I euer sawe thy face I allowed thy fauour, &amp;
onelie hearing of thy vertues with myne eare, I registred
them vp déepely in my hearte. Terentia hath béene
courted of manie, yet neuer made account of any: sundry
haue sought my loues, but they haue returned with losse.
Lentulus the terrour of the Parthians, the honour of the
Romaines and thy friend hath long woode, but what hath

hee won? onelie Tullie hath obtayned that which so many
haue mist, and yet he deales with Terentia as crabbedlie
as shee vsed him courteously, doe louers for fishes proffer
scorpions, or doe they like the serpent sting him which
cheerisheth him vp in his bosome. I séeke to fauour Tullie
and hee importunate sues for fauour for Lentulus. Art
thou so déepe a philosopher, as to déeme friendship aboue
marriage, or faith aboue fancie, or thy Terentia lesse then
thy Lentulus? If it be so take héede that Terentia too much
wronged scornes not both thée and Lentulus. Womens
thoughtes consistes oft in extréemes, and they that loue
most, if abused, hate most deadlie, fear this and beware of
my frowne, as yet there is but one wrinckle in my brow,
but if it once proue full of angrie sorrowes it will bee too
late to take holde of occasion behind: Thou art forewarnd
be forearmd and so farewell.
                  
                     Thy Terentia if thou wrong not Terentia.
                  
               
            
            AFter shée had written this Letter shée causde it to bee
conueied by Eutrapelus to Tullie, who reading the
contentes found not a salue to cure his maladie, but that
Terentia rubbed the scare a fresh by shaking him vp so
sharpely, yet coueting rather to die with an honourable
minde to Lentulus, then with a discredite to enioy beautifull
Terentia, he laide his heade on his pillowe, and with
manie sighes bewraide the depth of his sorrows. Hauing
laide his letter at his beds heade ouercharged with many
cares poore Tullie fell a sléepe and so sodenlie that Lentulus
by the helpe of Eutrapelus got to haue a sight of his
letter. Assoone as the Gentleman saw how déepely Terentia
was affected to his friende and perceyued by the circumstances
that he chose rather to die then to falsifie his
faith, such a secrete loue towardes Tullie so pierced the
closet of his honourable thoughtes that he 
                  •
               ell to conceipt

but meanlie of Terentia and to wish that his friende Cicero
might both recouer his health and his loue. Now began
the fancie of Lentulus to freze that earst was so great
a flame, and he that like the Salamander delighted to liue
in the fire, beganne to feare to accedere ad ignem, least he
shoulde Calescere plus quam satis. Now he called to mind
the resolution of Terentia tempered with frowardnesse,
and with this he did proportion the vertues of Flauia mixed
with courtesie, finding the fauour of the one aunswerable
to the beauty of the other. Then the faith of his friend,
his sickenes and extréeme sorrows. These weighed with
depe consideration he vowed to séeke by all meanes howe
to win Terentia wholy for his friende Cicero. In this humor
he conuaide the letter vnder his beddes heade and rested
silent till occasion might offer him oportunitie to discouer
the perfection of his amitie. Thus grewe Lentulus
at one time from his sickenes &amp; his loue, walking abroad &amp;
visiting Flaminius who entertayned him in all sumptuous
manner. But Lentulus séeing the thrée Ladies, made
no showe to Terentia nor scarse glaunced a looke vppon
hir beautie, but onely courted the Ladie Flauia, who
he founde so agreeable and plyant to his sutes, that Terentia
and Cornelia might easilie sée howe depely they were
linked in the league of affection. Leauing Tullie thus
sicke on his bed and Lentulus in swéete content with Flauia,
againe to our newe transformed Fabius who in this
time prooued one of the brauest Gentlemen in Rome, and
finding a restlesse passion in his mind for the beutie of Terentia,
as hauing continually before his eye the Idaea of
hir person séeing by hir meanes hee was metamorphosed
&amp; brought to this perfection making the force of his loue
priuie to his Father Vatinius, he was not onely praysed
for his good choice, but willed to goe forwarde in the optayning
of his affectiōs. Whereupon not willing to make
a long haruest to a small crop, to preuent as hee thought
that none shoulde cut the grasse from vnder his féete, hee

went to Terentias Father and blunt
                  ••
                craued his daughter
in marriage. He knowing him to be of honourable parentage
and of rich reuenewes, séeing shée woulde not
condiscende vnto Lentulus gaue him his francke good will
if he could créepe into his daughters fauour, who taking
the aduantage of the time went to find out Terentia, who
as then was verie melancholie sitting with Flauia &amp; Cornelia
talking of the sickenes of Tully. As they were thus
in 
                  •
               hat, came in Fabius who they streight knew &amp; wondered
at his strange alteration, he to shewe hee coulde as
well court it as the brauest young gentleman in Rome,
began thus curteously to salute the Ladies.
            Maruell not Ladies if a countrie swayne presume to
attempt y• presence of such rare excellencies séeing Oenones
shéephearde durst with his eye suruay the beautie of
diuine goddesses, and they to shewe they were as gratious
and full of fauours gaue him the greatest minion that
was counted the swéetest Peragon of the world. Earthlie
creatures you be, fayre Romaynes, but heauenly faces,
whose looks lighten diuine influence into the thoughts
of such as dare to contemplate your affections. I speake
this as being the man that from the cart liue in the court,
thus metamophosed by your supernaturall beauties. For
which fauour I am come in duetie to rest a bounden voterie
to your swéete selues. Terentia was so pensiue for
Tullyes passions that shée woulde make no aunswere: but
Cornelia whom alreadie Cupid had set on fire with Fabius
feature she returned him this replie.
            I remember Fabius that sitting in the groue by Arpinatum
a gentle swaine much like your self, in proportion
though not in properties, séeing wee were slenderly garded
with a page conducted vs home to Rome with his
friendlie companie, if it be your selfe, had wee as braue a
Ladie as Helena was and were shée in our power to bestowe,
wée woulde make you master and sole possessour of
hir beauties so to rewarde your courtesie. Fabius séeing

the marke so faire thought not to loose his shoote, but aim
                  •
               
his leuell thus.
            And for that cause Ladies is Fabius come that his mée
                  •
               
may not want his merite, glad that Venus dewes downe
such fauors, and oportunitie such showers of good fortunes
to finde you all here in so fit a time. For knowe honorable
Romaine
                  •
                that for my grosse and rude nature hating
the ciuill behauiour of the citie. I was surnamed
Fabius: in which obscure life I liued hauing my senses
eclipsed with follie, till the gods grudging at natures
spight, sent you thrée to bee ministers of my happines. For
comming into the groue where you lay all a sléepe casting
mine eye on the beautie of Terentia: Such a déepe impression
was figured in my mind, that I felt an vnacquainted
motion with a milde reuerence to thinke well of hir perfection:
surueying hir singular beauties, I fell so farre in
loue with hir excellencie, that from the countrie I came to
y• citie, &amp; how since by hir gratious sight I haue metamorphosed
my selfe your owne eares and the wonder of Rome
is best ablè to witnesse. Then Ladies I count the renewing
of my life to come from the feature of Terentia, and
that she not as Diana chaunged mee from a man to bée a
beast, but contrarie full of fauour hath reduced me from a
sensuall beast to a perfect resonable man. Howe déepely
then I ought to bée vowed to hir whose sight is the welspring
of my happinesse, let the greatnesse of my benefite
make manifest. In so much as féeding my thoughts with
the contemplation of Terentias beautie, I haue béene thus
transformed, but withall so surprised with hir loue that
as I haue gaind a seconde essence by hir swéete selfe, so I
haue lost my selfe within the labyrinth of hir lookes, that I
remayne hir captiue while it pleaseth hir to graunt me libertie.
Bee then braue Romaine Dames, impartiall
doomers of my sute, whether my desertes craue not Loue
that thus haue béene chaunged for hir loue. My Parentes
are Senators, my reuenewes inferiour to none, old Vatitinius
               
glad of my choise, and Terentias father thrise happy
if his daughter might like of Vatinius. Nowe restes it
onely in Terentias power to make me blessed or infortunate.
At this discourse of Fabius, the Ladies were astonished,
and Terentia galled to the quick with this demaund
held hir tongue, till Cornelia and Flauia, looking earnestly
vpon hir, asked hir what answere shée made to Fabius.
Such quoth shée as I returned to Lentulus, for know syr if
either the honor of a Souldier, y• dignity of a Romain, the
reuenewes of a Senators sonne, or the déepe impression of
fancy might haue drawn Terentia to loue, I had beene ere
this the wife &amp; paramour of Lentulus. But not y• courage
of Hector that woone Andromache, nor the wisedome of
Vlisses that intangled Calipso, nor the beauty of Priamus
sonne that drew Greece in armes to Troy, these perfections
if combined in one man shoulde not mooue Terentia
to listen to the allurements of Venus: not that I make
light estéeme of Lentulus, or that I holde small account of
Fabius, as two chiefe myrrours of our Romaine gentlemen:
But that either my vowes are resolute to Vesta, or
if Cupid hath taken me by the héele, it was before Lentulus
came from Parthia, or you from Arpinatum: so that
conclude howsoeuer it is I cannot become affectionate to
Fabius. At this reply Fabius stoode so amated as if hee had
beene an vnwelcome guest at the feast of Perseus, which
Cornelia noting, déepely in loue with Fabius shée told him
thus. Nor may you Fabius thinke much at this repulse sith
Lentulus and you are in one predicament, nowe both become
gainers in liberty, that haue béene loosers in loue:
and either gette the willowe garlande and so mourne for
your Ladies frowne, or séeke a mistresse that may shewe
you more fauor: For as for Terentia shée hath chosen, and
none must please hir but Oratours. If there be Fabius but
one Sunne that is thought the beauty of heauen, yet
there be planets that though not in shine, yet in influence
are as vertuous: what there bee Ladies I meane of such

course die as my selfe and Flauia, that when Terentia is
once married, looke for husbands. Fabius hearing Cornelia
thus pleasant, noted this quippe that none must please hir
but Oratours, which made Terentia blush for anger, and
Fabius to make this answere. I knowe no Oratours in
Roome quoth he whose yeares are answerable to Terentias
thoughtes but onely Marcus Tullius Cicero, and if it
be he, I sweare by the fitch that gaue him his syrname,
Terentia shall be mistresse of a goodly Cottage in Arpinatum.
Terentia hearing Fabius to giue Tully the frumpe
answered thus.
            The more his fortune if it be hee whose vertues hath
made him master of his owne desires, for his lands in Arpinatum
as they be little, yet shall his lacke be counteruaild
with his loues: and if he hath not one to inrich him
with dowry, yet I may perhaps content him with beauty.
And therefore Fabius to take away all suppositions, it is
Tully, &amp; none but Tully y• shall inioy Terentia. And quoth
Fabius in great choller, nor Tully, nor none besides Tully,
but Fabius shall inioy Terentia. Whereupon departing
without taking his farewell, going vnto hir father and
discoursing vnto him that Tully was the man that his
daughter had chosen for hir husband: swearing that his
sword ere it were long should end their loues. Although
Flaminius were grieued, yet he sought to pacifie Fabius,
but in vaine: for hee flung out of the dores in a rage, and
went to Milos house to séeke Tully. Where breathing out
many despightfull threats against the Oratour, it came
at last to Lentulus eare. Who nowe to make manifest
the déepe affection he bare to Cicero, trouping himselfe
with a crue of the Praetextati, and chiefe Romaine gentlemen
that had béene souldiers and trained vp with him in
the warres, he went to séeke out Fabius: and found him
with certaine his companions about the Capitoll. Lentulus
not brooking the braue of any, as carrying the heart of
a Conquerour, singled out Fabius, and after some wordes

they fell to blowes: but Fabius part were the weaker, so
that many were wounded, and some slaine. Upon this the
next day parts were taken, the people began to mutiny,
and to fall to intestine and ciuil iarres: that as in the time
of Scilla and Marius, so the stréets were filled with armed
Souldiers. The Senatours séeing what bloudy stratagems
woulde insue of this strife if it were not pacified:
sent for the Consuls, and charged them to raise vp some of
the Legions and to bring Lentulus, Tully and Fabius, the
next day to the senate house, with Terentia and hir father.
They obeying their commaund put this charge in execucution,
and so qualifiyng somewhat the fury of the people,
brought these thrée wooers with Terentia before the
whole state of Roome. Where being arriued Tully fearefull
of nature and sicke, yet somewhat strengthened with
the sight of his mistresse, beeing glad Lentulus was his
friend in his loues, after due reuerence began thus.
            
               Tullies Oration to the Senate.
               COnscript Fathers and graue Senators of Room,
I was borne in Arpinatum of base parentage, the
first of the Ciceroes that euer pleaded in Rostro, or
bare title in the city. If then aduanced by your fauours to
these fortunes, I should aspire without proportion to clime
beyonde my degrée, let me be the first and last whose presumption
shall grow to this preiudice. The temple of Ianus
in Roome hath hir gates shut, the s
                     •
                  reetes are full of
armed men, the stones of the Capitol blusheth at the bloud
of Romaines shed against hir walles: and all this mutiny
(cry mine aduersaries) growes from Tully. Not that Tully
was then out of his bedde, but that men of poore families
lifted vp to honor are soonest bitten with enuy. I appeale
graue Senatours for my life to your owne censures: if euer
I haue not béene more carefull to profit my country,
then desirous of preferment for my labours. But what

then say the people is cause of such broy
                     •
                  es, Terentia the
daughter of Flaminius, that firebrand that set Troy to cinders.
Beauty is like to bring Roome to confusion: For the
greatest houses and families are diuided, the Lentuly and
Vatinij, and this for Terentia. Let the cause be examined
before the Senators, and as they heare so let them doome,
Lentulus chosen by the Senate, was sent Captaine euer
many Legions against the Parthians, where he tyed fortune
to his thoughtes: and by his great victories and conquests
set vp trophées of Romaine chiualry. Returning
with glory to Roome, hauing set in his place Lepidus, he
was enamonred not onely of the beauty but vertues of
Terentia: the fame of whose excellency was spred amongst
the Parthians. Coueting to match with so honourable a
Lady, he courted hir, but in vaine: not that shée disdained
Lentulus, but that shée had fixed hir fancy before shée sawe
Lentulus: and the platforme of loue is able to receiue but
one impression. If honours, if conquestes, if parentage, if
reuenewes, if courage, if goods of fortune, body, or minde,
might haue woonne Terentia, al this was vnited in young
Lentulus: But Loue that liketh without exceptions, had
ouerbard hir heart with such former fancies, as the passionate
sute of Lentulus coulde haue no entrance. His
thoughtes were extreame, and the disquiet of his minde
brought a disease to his body. But when he knew that Terentia
loued his friend, he appeased his passions, and rested
content with his fortunes. The vnconstant goddesse whose
smyles are ouershadowed frowns, not contēt honor should
spring vp without enuy: sends Terentia to walke abroade
towards Arpinatum where then Fabius liued, as famous
for his rusticke and vnciuile life, as now he is woondred at
for his braue and courtly behauiour. Spying Terentia hee
was as Lentulus snared in hir beautie, that the Romains
to report a miracle said loue made him of a clowne braue
&amp; resolute gentleman. The excellencie of Terentia hauing
newe pollished nature in Fabius, hee sues for hir fauour,
but hir thoughtes that were forepointed with other passions,

intreates him to bridle affection and to make a conquest
of himselfe by subduing the force of fancie, séeing hir
resolution was directed to loue none but one, and that
was Tullie. This worde graue Senators and Romaynes
sounding basely in the eares of Fabius, caused him take
armes, and Lentulus to defende his friend Cicero, as for
him before had lost his loue, so he ment to loose his life and
withstoode him in the face. Thus grew this mutinie not
against beautie for it is a cheefe good of it selfe, nor against
Tullie for hee is meane and vnworthie to bee reuenged
by armes, but against Terentia because shee
vouchsafed to loue Tulllie. This Romaines is the cause
of this mutinie to suppresse which let Tullie die, for rather
had he pacifie this striffe by death then sée the meanest
Romaine fall on the sword. The common people at this
began to murmour, pleased with the plausible Oration
of Tullie, which one of the Senators seeing, stoode vp and
saide thus. Terentia? Cicero here hath shewed reasons
why thou shouldst loue Lentulus and Fabius, but what
reason canst thou infer to loue so meane a man as Tullie.
Terentia blushing made this answere. Before so honorable
an audience as these graue Senators and worthy Romayne
Citizens womens reasons would seeme no reasons,
especially in loue which is without reason, therefore
I onely yeld this reason, I loue Cicero not able to ratefie
my affection with anie strong reason, because loue is
not circumscript within reasons limits, but if it please the
Senate to pacifie this mutinie, let Terentia leaue to liue,
because she cannot leaue to loue and onely to loue Cicero.
At this she wept and stayned hir face with such a pleasing
vermilion die, that the people shouted none but Cicero.
Whereupon before the Senate Tully and Terentia were
betrothed, Lentulus and Fabius made friends, and the
one named Lentulus as the Annales make mention maried
to Flauia, and Fabius wedded to the worthy Cornelia.
