            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

SERMONS
PREACHT AT
WESTMINSTER,
On the day of the publike
Faſt (April 5. 1628)
To the Lords of
the High Court of
Parliament
And by their appointment
Publiſhed.
                  By the B. of EXCETER.
                  
                  
                     LONDON,
Printed for Nath
Butter. 1628.
               
            
            
               
                  
                  
                  
                     ESAY 5. the 4. and 5.
VERSES.
                     What could haue heene done
more to my Vineyard that
I haue not done in it? Wherefore
when I looked that it
ſhould bring foorth Grapes,
brought it forth wilde Grapes,
And now goe to, I will tell you,
what I will doe to my Vineyard;
I will take away the
Hedge thereof.
                  
                  
                     IT is a peece of a
Song (for ſo it is
called Verſ. 1. Alas,
what ſhould ſongs
doe to an heauie heart, Pro. 25.

20. or Muſicke in a day of
Mourning, Howling and Lamentation
is fitter for this occaſion?
Surely, as wee doe
ſometimes weepe for ioy; So
doe wee Sing alſo for ſorrow,
Thus alſo doth the Prophet
here; If it bee a Song, it is a
Dump; Eſayes Lachrymae; fit
for that (Sheminith) grauis ſymphonia,
as Tremelius turnes it,
which ſome ſad Pſalmes were
ſet vnto:1. Chron. 55 21. Both the Dittie,Pſal. 6. 1. and
the Tune are dolefull:Pſal. 12. 1. There
are in it three paſſionate
ſtraines; Fauours, Wrongs,
Reuenge: Bleſſings, Sinnes,
Iudgement; Fauours and bleſſings
from God to Iſrael;
Sinnes (which are the higheſt
wrongs) from Iſrael to God;
Iudgements, by way of reuenge,

from God to Iſrael;
and each of thoſe follow vpon
other; God begins with
fauours to his people; They
anſwere him with their ſinnes,
hee replies vpon them with
Iudgements; and all of theſe
are in their height; the fauours
of God are ſuch as hee askes.
What could be more; the ſins
are aggrauated by thoſe fauours;
what worſe then wilde
Grapes and diſappointment?
And the Iudgements muſt be
aggrauated to the proportion
of their ſinnes, what worſe
then the Hedge taken away,
the Wall broken, the Vinyard
troden downe, and eaten vp:
Let vs follow the ſtepps of
God, and his Prophet, in all
theſe; And when we haue paſſed

theſe in Iſrael, let vs ſeeke
to them at home: What
ſhould I need to craue attention;
the buſines is both Gods,
and our owne.
                  God and wee beginne with
fauours; fauours not meane
and ordinary; not expreſſed
in a right-downe affirmation,
but in an expoſtulatorie, and
ſelfe-conuincing Queſtion;
What could haue beene done
more to my Vineyard that I haue
not done to it? Euery word is
a new obligation. That Iſrael
is a Vineyard is no ſmall fauour
of God, that it is Gods
Vineyard, is yet more; that it
is Gods Vineyard ſo exquiſitely
cultiuated, as nothing
more could bee either added,
or deſired, is moſt of all:
                  
                     
Iſrael is no vaſt Deſert, no
wilde Forreſt, no mooriſh
Fenne, no barren Heath, no
thornie Thicket but a Vineyard;
a Soyle of vſe and fruit.
Looke where you will in
Gods Booke yee ſhall neuer
finde any liuely member of
Gods Church compared to
any but a fruitfull Tree; Not
to a tall Cypreſſe the Embleme
of vnprofitable Honor,
nor to a ſmooth Aſh the Embleme
of vnprofitable Prelacie,
that doth nothing but
beare Keyes: nor to a double-coloured
Poplar, the Embleme
of Diſſimulation; nor
to a wel ſhaded Plane, that hath
nothing but Forme; nor to a
hollow Maple, nor to a trembling
Aſpe; nor to a prickly

Thorne; ſhortly, not to any
Plant whatſoeuer whoſe fruit
is not vſefull and beneficiall;
Heare this then yee goodly
Cedars, ſtrong Elmes, faſtgrowing
Willowes, ſappie
Sycomores, and all the reſt of
the fruitleſſe trees of the earth,
I meane all faſhionable and
barren profeſſors whatſoeuer,
yee may ſhoote vp in height,
yee may ſpread farre, ſhade
well, ſhow faire, but what are
yee good for? Yee may bee
fit for the Forreſt, Ditches,
Hedgrowes of the World; yee
are not for the true ſauing
ſoyle of Gods Iſrael; that is a
Vineyard; there is place for
none but Vines; &amp; true Vines
are fruitfull: He that abideth
in me bringeth foorth much

fruit, ſaith our Sauiour, Iohn
15. 5.
                  And of all fruits, what is
comparable to that of the
Vine? Let the Vine it ſelfe
ſpeake in Iothams Parable,
Iud. 9. 19. Should I leaue my
Wine which cheareth God
and man? How is this? God
cheared with Wine? It is an
high hyperbole; Yet ſeconded
by the God of truth; I
will drinke no more of the fruit
of this Vine, till I drinke it new
with you in my Fathers kingdom,
Mat. 26. 29. It muſt needes be
an excellent liquor which is
vſed to reſemble the ioyes of
heauen: Yea, the bloud of
the Sonne of God, that celeſtial
nectar, which to morrow
ſhall cheere our Soules, is it

otherwiſe reſembled then by
the bloud of the Grape? He
is Vitis vera, the true Vine
this is his iuice.
                  Alas; would God we had
not too much cauſe to complaine
of the pleaſure of this
fruit; Religion, Reaſon, Humanitie
ſauour not to the palate
of many in compariſon of
it? Wine is a mocker, ſaith
Salomon: How many thouſands
doth it daily cheate of
their Subſtance, of their Patrimony,
of their Health, of their
Wit, of their Senſe, of their
Life, of their Soule? Oh that
we had the grace to bee ſenſible
of our owne ſcorne, and
danger; But this is the honour
of the fruit, and the ſhame of
the man: the exceſſe is not

more our ſinne, then the delicacie
is the prayſe of the
Grape; For ſweetneſſe of verdure,
then all Plants will yeild
to the Vine; ſo taſtfull, ſo pleaſing,
ſo delightfull vnto God
are the perſons, the graces, the
endeauours of his Iſrael. Their
perſons are, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Rom. 12. 1.
Their Loue is better then
Wine Cant. 4. 10. Their Almes
are 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , a ſweete ſmelling
ſauour, Philip. 4. 18. Their
prayers as euening Incenſe;
of a moſt fragrant compoſition;
and, for the reſt of their
wordes; The roofe of their
mouth is like the beſt Wine,
Cant. 7. 9. Acceptation hath
woont to bee the incouragement
of forwardneſſe; Honorable
and beloued, how ſhould

this harten vs in our holy ſtations,
in our conſcionable actions;
Whiles wee continue
Vines it is not in the power of
our imperfections, to loſe our
thankes; The delicateſt Grape
cannot bee ſo relliſh-ſome to
the palate of man, as our poore
weake obediences are to the
God of mercies. Thou haſt
rauiſhed my heart, my Siſter,
my Spouſe, thou haſt rauiſhed
my heart; ſaith Chriſt of his
Church, Cant. 4. 9. The Vine
is a noble plant, but a feeble
and tender one; Other trees
grow vp alone out of the
ſtrength of their owne ſap;
this grouels on the ground,
and rots if it haue not an Elme
to prop it; Like as Man, the
beſt creature, is in his birth

moſt helpleſſe; and would
preſently die without outward
ſuccours; Such is the Iſrael
of God; the worthieſt peece
of Gods Creation; yet of it
ſelfe impotent to good; here
is no growth, no life but from
that Diuine Hand; Without
Me can yee do nothing: They
are no Vines that can ſtand alone;
thoſe proud Spirits, as
they haue no need of God, ſo
God hath no intereſt in them;
His Iſrael is a Vineyard; and
the Vine muſt be propped.
                  As a Vineyard, ſo Gods
Vineyard. The Church ſhall
be ſure not to be Maſterleſſe:
There is much waſte ground
that hath no Owner; our
Globe can tell vs of a great
part of the World, that hath

no name but Incognita, not
knowne, whether it haue any
inhabitant; but a Vineyard
was neuer without a Poſſeſſor;
till Noah the true Ianus
planted one, there was no
newes of any; Come into
ſome wilde Indian Forreſt all
furniſhed with goodly Trees,
you know not whether euer
man were there; Gods hand
we are ſure hath beene there;
perhaps not mans; but if you
come into a well dreſſed Vineyard,
where you ſee the Hillockes
equally ſwelling, the
ſtakes pitcht in a iuſt height &amp;
diſtance, and the Vines, handſomly
pruned, now it is eaſie to
ſay (as the Philoſopher did
when he found Figures) Here
hath bin a man, yea a good huſband.

There is an vniuerſall
prouidence of God ouer the
World; but there is a ſpeciall
eye, and hand of God ouer
his Church: In this God challengeth
a peculiar intereſt that
is his (as wee heard worthily
this Day) in a double right, of
Confederation, of Redemption;
Iſrael is my Sonne, yea
my firſt borne, ſaith God to
Pharaoh: Thou haſt brought
a Vine out of Egypt, thou haſt
caſt out the heathen and planted
it, ſaith the Pſalmiſt, 80. 8.
                  Oh the blaſphemous diffidence
of fooliſh men! Can we,
dare we impute ill husbandry
to the God of Heauen? Hath
God a Vineyard, and ſhall he
not tend it? Shall hee not
mightily protect it? Goe on,

yee Foxes, yee little Foxes,
to ſpoile the tender Grapes;
Goe on yee Boares of the
Wood to waſte this Vineyard,
and ye wild beaſts of the field
to deuoure it; our ſinnes, our
ſinnes haue giuen this ſcope
to your violence, and our calamitie:
But yee ſhall once
know that this Vineyard hath
an Owner; euen the mightie
God of Iacob; euery cluſter
that you haue ſpoiled ſhall be
fetcht backe againe from the
bloudie Wine-preſſe of his
wrath: And in ſpight of all
the gates of Hell, this Vine
ſhall flouriſh. Euen ſo, Returne
we beſeech thee, O God
of Hoſts; looke downe from
Heauen and viſit this Vine:
and the Vineyard which thy

right hand hath planted: and
the branch that thou madeſt
ſtrong for thy ſelfe.
                  Yee haue ſeene Iſrael a
Vineyard, and Gods Vineyard▪
now caſt your eyes vpon
the fauours that God hath
done to his Vineyard Iſrael;
ſuch, as that God appeales
their owne hearts for Iudges;
What could haue beene done more
to my Vineyard that I haue not
done? Marke, I beſeech you;
Hee doth not ſay, What could
haue beene done more then hath
beene done, but, more, that I haue
not done; challenging all the
acts done to his Vineyard for
his owne; as the Soyle is his,
ſo is all the Culture; Hee that
elſe where makes himſelfe the
Vine, and his Father the Huſbandman,

here, makes Iſrael
the Vine, and himſelfe the
Husbandman; nothing is, nothing
can bee done to his
Church that paſſeth not his
hands: My Father ſtill worketh,
ſaith hee, and I worke.
This worke, this care knowes
no end, no limits. Many a
good Husband ouer-taskes
himſelfe, and vndertakes
more, then his eye can ouerlooke,
or his hand ſway; and
therefore is faine to truſt to
the menagement of others;
and it ſpeedes thereafter. But
the Owner of this Vineyard
is euery where; and workes
where euer he is; nothing can
paſſe his eye, euery thing muſt
paſſe his hand; This is the
difference betwixt Salomons
                     
Vineyard, and his that is greater
then Salomon; Salomon lets
out his Vineyard to Keepers,
Cant. 8. 11. Chriſt keepes his in
his owne hand; Hee vſeth indeed
the helpe of Men, but
as Tooles, rather then as Agents,
he workes by them, they
cannot worke but by him; Are
any of you great Ones, Benefactours
to his Church (a rare
ſtile I confeſſe in theſe not datiue
but ablatiue times) yee
are but as the hands of the
Subalmoners of Heauen: God
giues by you: Are any great
Potentates of the earth ſecret
or open perſecutours of his
Church: Aſhur is the rod of
my wrath, ſaith God; They
are but as Gods pruning
Kniues, to make his Vine

bleede out her ſuperfluous
iuice: God cuts by them:
He is the Author of both, men
are the inſtruments. To him
muſt we returne the prayſe of
his mercie in the one, and in
the other, the awe of his
iudgements, what euer is done
to his Church, God doth it
himſelfe. Neither doth hee
ſay, What could I haue done more
that I haue not done, as our former
Tranſlation reads it, with
a reference to his abſolute
power; according whereto,
we know that he can do more
then hee doth, more then hee
will doe, but (
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ) Quid
faciendum; What could haue
beene done more in reſpect of
the exigence of the occaſion;
Would God ſet his omnipotent

Power vpon it, we know
hee could make all the World
Iſrael; he could make all Iſrael
Saints, hee could haue made
Deuils men, men Angels. But
God vſes not to proceed according
to the rule of an abſolute
Omnipotencie, but according
to the Oeconomie of
his moſt holy, moſt wiſe, moſt
iuſt Decrees: Whereby hee
hath chalked out vnto men
thoſe wayes, and helpes of ſaluation,
which hee ſees fit for
the attainment of that end;
theſe are they wherein he hath
not beene fayling to his Iſrael.
                  Of theſe hee ſayes, What
could haue beene done more that I
haue not done? See what notice
God takes, and what reckonings

hee keepes of all the
good that hee doth to any
Church or people; he files vp
all his bleſſings; Hee is bountifull
not profuſe; open-handed,
but not ſo as that his largeſſe
makes him reſpectleſſe
or forgetfull of his beneficences;
hee giues not like the picture
of Fortune, blindfolded;
or, like an Almoner in a
throng, hee knowes not to
whom; he notes both the man
and the fauour; In our gifts,
our left hand may not know
what our right hand doth, becauſe
our weakneſſe is ſubiect
to a proud-ſelfe-conceit, and a
miſ-opinion of too much obligation
in the Receiuer; but
he, whoſe infinite goodneſſe
is not liable to any danger of

thoſe infirmities which follow
our ſinfull nature, ſets all
his mercies on the ſcore, and
will not balke one of the leaſt.
Hee that could ſay to Iſrael I
tooke thee from among the
Pots, and to Dauid, I tooke
thee from following the Ewes
great with Lambe; doe yee not
thinke he ſtill ſayes to his Anointed,
I brought you from
weake in the Cradle to ſtrong
in the Throne; I kept you
from treacherous hands; I returnd
you ſafe from the dangers
of your Southerne Voyage
I haue giuen you not the
hands and knees, but the harts
of your Subiects. Doe I not
thinke hee ſaith to mee, I
brought thee from the ferule
to a paſtorall ſtaffe; to another,

I brought thee from the bench
of Iuſtice to the ſeate of Honour;
to an other I deliuered
thee from the Sword of thine
Enemie, from the bed of thy
ſickneſſe, from the walls of
thy reſtraint, from the Powder
Myne; I made thee Noble,
thee Rich, thee Potent; I
made this Country populous,
that Citie wealthy, this Kingdome
ſtrong, Bee ſure, if
we be forgetfull, God will not
miſ-reckon his owne mercies:
Our fauours are (like our
ſelues) poore and impotent,
worthy to bee ſcribled vpon
the Sand, that they may bee
waſht off with the next waue,
his, are full of goodneſſe, and
infinite compaſſion, fit for the
Marble of an eternall remembrance.

Honourable and beloued,
Why doe not we keepe
one part of the Tally, as hee
keepes the other, that ſo wee
may hold eeuen reckonings
with our munificent God?
How ſhould wee meditate
continually of the gracious
and wonderfull works of his
bountie, knowing that God
hath ſo done his great works,
that they ought to bee had in
perpetuall memory; How
ſhould wee gratefully recount
his fauours, and call the World
about vs, with the ſweete ſinger
of Iſrael; Come hither, and
heare all yee that feare God, and
I will tell you what hee hath done
for my ſoule, Pſal. 56. 16. O
God it is a iuſt quarrell that
thou haſt againſt vs for our

vnthankfulneſſe; the familiaritie
of thy bleſſings haue
drawne them into neglect.
Alas, thy mercies haue not
beene ſowne, but buried in vs;
We haue beene gulfes to ſwallow
them, not repoſitories to
keepe them; How worthily do
we ſmart, becauſe wee forget.
How iuſtly are thy iudgements
ſeene vpon vs, becauſe
thy mercies are not. Away
with this wretched ingratitude;
Oh loue the Lord,
                     Pſal. 31. 23. 
                     all yee
his Saints, for the Lord preſerueth
the faithfull, and plentifully
rewardeth the proud doer.
                  
                  What then is it, O Lord,
what is it that thou haſt done,
then which more could not
bee done for thy Vineyard?
Thou beſt knoweſt thine own
mercies, and canſt beſt expreſſe

them: thou that wouldſt
not haue vs ſearch into thy
counſels, wouldſt not haue vs
ignorant of thy fauours: thoſe
are particularized in the foregoing
words: In thy choice. In
thy fence, In picking, In planting,
in ouerſight, in preſſing;
                  Firſt, there is the aduantage
of the place choſen; where
hath hee ſetled his Vineyard
but vpon a very fruitfull Hill?
A double aduantage, An hill,
and very fruitfull: Hils are
held beſt for Vines; the decliuitie
whereof giues much
ſtrength to the reflexion; ſo
as the moſt generous Vines
are noted to grow vpon the
hils. Yet, there are barren hils;
nothing but heapes of vnprofitable
ſands; this is a fruitfull

hill, yea ſuperlatiuely fruitfull,
the home of the Son of oyle,
as it is in the originall; that is,
by an Hebraiſme; an hill eminently
fat and fertile.
                  But what would it auaile
the ground to bee fruitfull,
if it bee vnfenced, that the
wild Bore, or the Foxes may
ſpoyle it: as good no fruit as
to no purpoſe.
                  Loe then here, Secondly,
both an hedge, and, leaſt that
ſhould not bee ſufficient, a
Wall.
                  But to what purpoſe ſhould
it be fenced with ſtones without,
if it bee choaked with
ſtones within; As therefore
thirdly the ſtones were laide
together in the Wall, for defence;
So they were gathered

off from the ſoyle to auoide
offence.
                  But to what purpoſe is the
fruitfulneſſe, fencing, ſtoning,
if the ground yeeld a plentifull
Crop of Bryers, Thiſtles,
Weedes? Iniuſſa vireſcunt gramina;
ill Weedes grow faſt;
here is therefore, Fourthly,
the maine fauour to this Vineyard,
that the owner hath
planted it with choiſeſt Vines;
It is the praiſe of the Earth, to
ſofter any Plant that is put into
the boſome of it; it is the chief
care of the Husbandman to
ſtore it with Mants of worth:
                  Now all this prouiſion of
ſoyle, Fencing, Stoning, Planting,
were nothing without a
continual ouer-ſight; the wiſe
owner therfore. Fiftly, builds,

not a Bowre, not a Banqueting
houſe, for pleaſure, but a
Towre for ſuruay; and that
not in ſome obſcure Angle,
but in the midſt of the Vineyard,
that hee may view the
carriage of his labourers, and
deſcrie the firſt danger of the
annoyances.
                  Laſtly, to what purpoſe
were all this choyce, Fencing,
Stoning, Planting, ouer-ſight,
if when the Grapes are grown
to their due ripeneſſe, they
ſhould not bee improued to
an vſefull Vintage, this muſt
be done by the Wine-preſſe;
That is ſet vp: and now, what
can remaine, but the ſetting
vnder of Veſſels to receiue the
comfortable iuice, that ſhall
flow from theſe, ſo well huſbanded
cluſters.
                  
                     
All this hath God done for
his Vinyard, what could haue
beene done more?
                  Not to dwell in the myſts
of Allegories; God himſelfe
hath reade this Riddle. The
Vineyard of the Lord of hoaſts
is the houſe of Iſrael:
                     Verſe 7. And the
houſe of Iſrael is his Church.
The Church is Gods hill,
conſpicuous for his wonderfull
fauours (though not euer)
euen to the eye of the
World; not an hidden vnheeded
Valley. A fruitfull Hill, not
by nature, but by grace; Nature
was like it ſelfe, in it, in
the World; God hath taken it
in from the barren Downes,
and gooded it: his choice did
not find but make it thus.
                  Thus choſen hee hath fenced

it about with the hedge
of Diſcipline, with the wall of
his Almightie protection.
                  Thus fenced hee hath ordained,
by iuſt cenſures to
picke out of it thoſe ſtones of
offence, which might hinder
their holy proceedings, and
keepe downe the grouth of
the Vines; whether ſcandalous
Men, falſe Opinions, or
euill Occurrences.
                  Thus cleared, he hath planted
it with the choyſeſt Vines
of gracious motions, of wholſome
Doctrines,
                  Thus planted, hee hath ouerlookt
it from the Watchtowre
of Heauen, in a carefull
inſpection vpon their wayes,
in a prouident care of their
preſeruation.
                  
                     
Thus ouer-looked, he hath
indeuoured to improue it by
his ſeaſonable Wine-preſſe in
reducing all theſe powers and
fauours, to act, to vſe; whether
by fatherly corrections,
or by ſuggeſting meet opportunities
of practice; And now
hauing thus choſen, fenced,
cleared, planted, watched, and
ordered to ſtraine his Vines,
hee ſayes moſt iuſtly what
could haue beene done more
that I haue not done?
                  Certainely it is not in the
power of any humane apprehenſion
to conceiue what act
could be added to perfect his
culture, what bleſſing could
bee added to the indearing of
a Church. If hee haue made
choyce of a people for his

owne; If he haue bleſſed them
with good gouernement,
with ſafe protection, If he haue
remoued all hinderances of
their proficiencie; If hee haue
giuen them wholeſome inſtructions,
and plide them with
ſolicitations to good; If his
prouident eye haue beene euer
ouer them for their deliuerances;
If laſtly, he haue vſed
both faire &amp; foule meanes
to wring from them the good
iuice of their obedience; Say
men are Angels. What could
haue beene done more? What
Church ſo euer in the World
can make good to it ſelfe theſe
ſpecialities of mercie, Let it
know that God hath abated
nothing to it of the height of
his fauour.
                  
                     
Theſe are the fauours
wherewith God hath begun
to Iſrael, now turne your eares
to the anſwere that Iſrael returnes
to God, ſee the mercies
of a good God requited
with the rebellions of a wicked
people; wherefore when
I looked that it ſhould bring
forth grapes, brought it forth
wilde grapes? A wofull iſſue
of ſuch bleſſings: wild grapes,
and that with the diſappointment
of Gods expectation.
                  Two vſual faults doth God
find with any vicious Tree;
No fruit, Ill fruit, The one in
omiſſion of good, the other,
in commiſſion of ſinne: The
fig-tree in the way is curſed
for the one; Iſrael here taxed
for the other.
                  
                     
What then are theſe wilde,
or as Pagnine renders it vuae
putidae, rotten Grapes? God
hath not left it to our gheſſe,
but hath plainly told vs v. 7. in
an elegant parenomaſie I looked
for (
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ) iudgement
and behold (
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ) a wound
or ſcab: that is oppreſſion) I
lookt for 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      Iuſtice, and behold
(
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ) clamour. Generally
what euer diſpoſition or act,
vncultured nature doth, or
would produce of it ſelfe, that
is a wild grape: Particularly,
the Holy Ghoſt hath here
inſtanced in ſeuerall ſinnes, ſo
ſtiled: A ſelf-greatning oppreſſion,
verſ. 8. A ſetled drunkenneſſe
and wilfull debauchedneſſe,
verſ. 11. A determined
reſolution of wicked courſes,

                     verſe 18. A nicknaming of
good and euill, verſe 20. A
ſelfe conceitedneſſe in their
owne wayes, verſe 21. Briberie
in their Iudges, 1. 23. Pride in
their women 3. 16. obdured
infidelitie in all 6. 10. Wilde
grapes indeed, ſuch as corrupted
nature yeelds without
a correction, without an alteration:
ſhee her ſelfe is wilde;
ſhee can yeeld but what ſhee
hath, what ſhe is; Pleaſe your
ſelues who liſt in the opinion
of your faire, and ſweet, and
plauſible diſpoſition; yee ſhall
find nature at her beſt but a
wild Vine; In me that is in my
fleſh there dwelleth no good;
ſaith the choſen Veſſell: Wild
grapes, for the harſhneſſe and
fowreneſſe of the taſte; for

the odiouſneſſe of their Verdure
to the palate of the Almightie,
the beſt fruits of nature
are but glorious ſinnes,
the worſt are horrible abhominations:
Such are the wild
grapes of Iſrael; which yet
could not haue beene ſo ill if
God had not beene put into
an expectation of better, and
if this expectation had not bin
croſſed with diſappointment:
Wherefore, when I looked that
it ſhould bring forth Grapes,
brought it forth wilde Grapes?
Had only Maples, or Thornes,
or Willowes growne there,
God would not haue lookt
for Grapes; had only wilde
Vines growne there; GOD
would not haue lookt for pleaſing
cluſters, but now that

God furniſhed the Soyle with
Noble and Generous Plants,
with what ſcorne, and indignation
doth hee looke vpon
wilde Grapes? Fauours beſtowed
raiſe expectation, and
expectation fruſtated doubles
the iudgement: The very
leaues and the high way drew
a curſe vpon the Fig-tree;
Woe be to thee Chorazin, Woe be
to thee Bethſaida. Sonne of man
what ſhall be done to the Vine
of all trees? Woe bee to thee O
Vineyard of Iſrael: I will take
away the hedge thereof, and it
ſhall bee eaten vp; I will breake
downe the wall, and it ſhall bee
trodden downe.
                  
                  My ſpeech ſhould now deſcend
to the wofull vengeance,
that God threats to and inflicts

vpon his Iſrael; A fit
Theame for ſo heauie a day;
the Hedge of good gouernment
and wholſome Lawes
ſhall bee trodden downe; the
wall of Diuine Protection
ſhall be broken; the beaſts of
the Field and Forreſt ſhall be
let in; the Grapes deuoured,
the Trees brouzed and trampled
vpon, the roots extirpate;
to the full and finall vaſtation
of Iſrael; to the ſcorne and hiſſing
of all Nations, to the iuſt
terror of all the World, whiles
that dearling people which
was once the example of
Gods mercy, is now becomne
the fearefull ſpectacle of his
furie, and reuenge; ſuruiuing
only in ſome few abhorred,
and deſpiſed Vagabonds, to

ſhew that there was once ſuch
a Nation: But the time and
occaſion call my thoughts
homeward, and inuite me rather,
to ſpend the reſt of my
houre, in paralleling Iſraels
bleſſings, ſinnes, threats of
iudgement with our owne:
Wherein our intereſt ſhall bee
a ſufficient motiue of our attention;
Gather you together
therefore, gather you, O Nation,
not worthy to be loued;
and caſt backe your eyes vpon
thoſe incomparable fauours,
wherewith God hath prouoked,
and indeared this Iland;
in which, I dare boldly ſay we
are, at the leaſt, his ſecond Iſrael.
How hath hee choſen vs
out of all the Earth, and diuided
vs from the reſt of the

World, that wee might bee a
ſingular patterne, and ſtrange
wonder of his bountie; what
ſhould I ſpeake of the wholeſome
temper of our Clime;
the rich prouiſion of all vſefull
Commodities; ſo as wee
cannot ſay only as Sanchez
did, I haue moyſture enough
within my owne ſhell, but as
Dauid did, Poculum exuberans,
My cup runnes ouer to the ſupply
of our Neighbour Nations;
what ſpeake I of the populouſneſſe
of our Cities, the
defencedneſſe of our ſhoares;
theſe are nothing to that heauenly
treaſure of the Goſpel,
which makes vs the Vineyard
of God and that ſweet peace,
which giues vs the happie fruition
of that ſauing Goſpel:

                     Albion doe we call it? nay (as
he rightly) Polyolbion; richly
bleſſed; O God, what, where
is the Nation, that can emulate
vs in theſe fauours?
                  How hath hee fenced vs about,
with the hedge of good
Diſcipline, of wholeſome
Lawes, of gracious Gouernment;
with the brazen wall
of his Almightie, and miraculous
protection; Neuer
Land had more exquiſite
Rules of Iuſtice, whether
mute, or ſpeaking: Hee hath
not left vs to the mercie of a
rude Anarchie, or a tyrannicall
violence, but hath regulated
vs by Lawes of our owne aſking,
and ſwayd vs by the iuſt
Scepters of moderate Princes▪
                  
                  Neuer Land had more conuincing

proofes of an Omnipotent
Tuition; whether againſt
forraine Powers, or ſecret
Conſpiracies; Forget if
yee can the yeare of our Inuaſion,
the Day of our Purim;
Beſides the many particularities
of our deliuerances
filed vp by the pen of one of
our worthy Prelates.
                  How hath hee giuen vs
meanes to remoue the rubs of
our growth; and to gather away
the ſtones of falſe doctrine,
of hereticall prauitie,
of miſchieuous machinations
that might hold downe his
truth: And, which is the head
of all, How hath he brought
our Vine out of the Egypt of
Popiſh Superſtition, and planted
it; In plaine termes; how

hath hee made vs a truly-orthodoxe
Church; eminent
for puritie of doctrine, for the
graue and reuerend ſolemnitie
of true Sacraments, for the
due forme of gouernment,
for the pious and Religious
forme of our publike Lyturgie;
with what plentie hath
hee ſhowred vpon vs the firſt
and latter raine of his heauenly
Goſpel? With what rare gifts
hath hee graced our Teachers?
With what pregnant ſpirits
hath hee furniſht our Academies?
With what competencie
of maintenance hath he heartned
all learned Profeſſions?
So as in theſe regards; we may
ſay of the Church of England,
Many Daughters haue done vertuouſly,
                     Prou. 31. 29. 
                     but thou excelleſt them all.
                  
                  
                     
How hath the vigilant eye
of his prouidence out of his
doore of Heauen watcht ouer
this Iland for good? not an helliſh
Pioner could mine vnder
ground, but hee eſpied him;
not a darke Lanterne could
offer to deceiue midnight, but
he deſcryes it; not a plot, not
a purpoſe of euill could looke
out, but he hath diſcouered it;
and ſhamed the Agents, and
glorified his mercie in our deliuerance.
                  Laſtly, how infinitely hath
his louing care laboured to
bring vs to good? What ſweet
opportunities, and incouragements
hath hee giuen vs of a
fruitfull obedience? and when
his fatherly counſels would
not worke with vs, how hath

he ſcruzed vs in the Winepreſſe
of his heauie afflictions; one
while, with a raging Peſtilence,
another while, with the
inſolence and preualence of
enemies, one while with vnkindly
ſeaſons, another while,
with ſtormie and wracking
tempeſts, if by any meanes
hee might fetcht from vs the
precious iuice of true penitence,
and faithfull obedience;
that we might turne and liue;
If the preſſe bee weightie, yet
the wine were ſweet.
                  Lay now all theſe together,
And what could haue beene done
more for our Vineyard, O God,
that thou haſt not done? Looke
about you, Honourable and
Chriſtian hearers, and ſee
whether God haue done thus

with any Nation; Oh neuer,
neuer was any people ſo
bound to a God: Other neighbouring
Regions would think
themſelues happie in one
drop of thoſe bleſſings which
haue powred downe thicke
vpon vs: Alas, they are in a
vaporous and mariſh vale,
whiles wee are ſeated on the
fruitfull Hill; they lie open to
the maſſacring Knife of an
enemie, whiles we are fenced:
they are clogged with miſerable
incumbrances, whiles we
are free; Briers, and Brambles
ouerſpread them, whiles
we are choicely planted; their
tower is of offence, their winepreſſe
is of bloud. Oh the lamentable
condition of more
likely Vineyards then our

owne; who can but weepe
and bleed to ſee theſe wofull
calamities that are falne vpon
the late famous and flouriſhing
Churches of Reformed
Chriſtendome? Oh, for that
Palatine Vine, late inoculated
with a precious bud of
our Royall Stemme; that
Vine not long ſince rich in
goodly cluſters; now the inſultation
of Boares, and prey
of Foxes; Oh for thoſe poore
diſtreſſed Chriſtians in France,
Boheme, Sileſia, Morauia, Germanie,
Auſtria, Valtoline, that
groane vnder the tyrannous
yoake of Antichriſtian oppreſſion;
how glad would they
bee of the crummes of our
Feaſts; how rich would they
eſteeme themſelues with the

very gleanings of our plentifull
crop of proſperitie; How
do they looke vp at vs, as euen
now Militantly triumphant,
whiles they are miſerably wallowing
in duſt and bloud; and
wonder to ſee the Sun-ſhine
vpon our hill, whiles they are
drenched with ſtorme and
tempeſt in the Valley?
                  What are we, O God, what
are we, that thou ſhouldſt bee
thus rich in thy mercies to vs,
whiles thou art ſo ſeuere in
thy iudgements vnto them?
It is too much, Lord, it is too
much, that thou haſt done for
ſo ſinfull and rebellious a
people.
                  Caſt now your eyes aſide
a little, and, after the view of
Gods fauours, ſee ſome little

glimpſe of our requitall; ſay,
then, ſay, O Nation not worthy
to be beloued; What fruit
haue ye returnd to your beneficent
God? Sin is impudent;
but let me challenge the impudent
forehead of ſinne it ſelfe;
Are they not ſowre and wilde
Grapes that we haue yeelded?
Are we leſſe deep in the ſins of
Iſrael, then in Iſraels bleſſings?
Complaints, I know, are vnpleaſing,
how euer iuſt; but
now, not more vnpleaſing thē
neceſſarie, Wo is me, my mother,
                     Ier. 15. 10.
                     that thou haſt horne me a man of
contention. I muſt cry out in this
ſad day of the ſins of my people.
                  
                  The Searchers of Canaan,
when they came to the brook
of Eſheol, they cut down a branch,
with a cluſter of Grapes, and carried

it on a ſtaffe betweene two, to
ſhew Iſrael the fruit of the Land,
Numb. 13. 23. Giue me leaue,
in the ſearch of our Iſrael, to
preſent your eyes with ſome
of the wilde grapes that grow
there, on euery hedge: And
what if they bee the very ſame
that grew in this degenerated
Vineyard of Iſrael?
                  Where we meet firſt with
oppreſſion; a Lordly ſinne,
and that challengeth precedencie
(as which is commonly
incident to none but the
great (though a poore oppreſſor
(as he is vnkindly) ſo he is
a monſter of mercileſneſſe.)
Oh the loud ſhrieks and clamours
of this crying ſinne!
What grinding of faces, what
racking of Rents, what detention

of wages, what incloſing
of Commons, what ingroſſing
of Commodities,
what griping exactions, what
ſtrayning the aduantages of
greatneſſe, what vnequall leuies
of Legal payments, what
ſpightfull Sutes, what Depopulations,
what Vſuries, what
violences aboūd euery where?
                  The ſighes, the teares, the
bloud of the poore pierce the
Heauens, and call for a fearefull
retribution; This is a
ſowre Grape indeed, and that
makes God to wring his face
in an angry deteſtation.
                  Drunkenneſſe is the next;
not ſo odious in the weaknes
of it as in the ſtrength: Oh
wofull glory; ſtrong to drinke:
Woe is me, how is the World

tum'd beaſt? What bouzing,
and quaffing, and whiffing,
and healthing is there on euery
bench; and what reeling
and ſtaggering in our ſtreets?
What drinking by the Yard,
the Die, the Dozen? What
forcing of pledges. VVhat
quarrels for meaſure; and
forme? How is that becomme
an excuſe of villany, which
any villany might rather
excuſe. I was drunke, How
hath this torrent, yea this
deluge of exceſſe in meates
and drinks drowned the face
of the Earth, and riſen many
Cubits aboue the higheſt
Mountaines of Religion and
good Lawes? Yea would God
I might not ſay that which I
feare; and ſhame, and grieue

to ſay, that euen ſome of them
which ſquare the Arke for others,
haue beene inwardly
drowned, and diſcouered their
nakedneſſe. That other inundation,
ſcoured the World,
this impures it, and what but
a Deluge of fire can waſh it
from ſo abominable filthines.
                  Let no Popiſh Eaueſ-dropper
now ſmile to thinke what
aduantage I giue by ſo deepe a
cenſure of our owne profeſſion;
Alas, theſe ſinnes know
no difference of Religions;
would God they themſelues
were not rather more deepe in
theſe foule enormities; we extenuate
not our guilt; what euer
wee ſinne, wee condemne
it as mortall; they palliate
wickedneſſe with the faire

pretence of Venialitie; ſhortly;
They accuſe vs, we them,
God both:
                  But where am I? How eaſie
is it for a man to looſe himſelfe
in the ſinnes of the time?
It is not for mee to haue mine
habitation in theſe blacke
Tents; Let me paſſe through
them running: VVhere can a
man caſt his eye not to ſee that
which may vexe his ſoule?
                  Here Briberie and corruption
in the ſeats of Iudicature:
their Periuries at the Barre;
here partialitie and vniuſt
conniuencie in Magiſtrates,
there diſorder in thoſe that
ſhould be Teachers; Here Sacriledge
in Patrons, there Simoniacall
contracts in vnconſcionable
Leuits; Here bloodie

Oathes and Execrations,
there ſcurrile prophaneneſſe.
Here cozening in bargaines,
there breaking of promiſes;
Here perſfidious Vnderminings,
there flattering ſupparaſitations:
Here pride in both
Sexes, but eſpecially the weaker,
there Luxurie and VVantonneſſe.
                  Here contempt of Gods
Meſſengers, there neglect of
his Ordinances, and violations
of his Dayes: the time
and my breath would ſooner
faile me then this wofull Bedroll
of wickedneſſe:
                  Yet alas, were theſe the
ſinnes of Ignorance, of Infirmitie,
they might bee more
worthy of pittie then hatred;
But oh, the high hand of our

preſumptuous offences, wee
draw iniquitie with the ſtrings
of vanitie, vp to the head, vp
to the eare, and ſhoot vp theſe
hatefull ſhafts againſt heauen▪
Did wee ſit in darkneſſe and
the ſhadow of death, as too
many Pagan and Popiſh Regions
doe, theſe workes of
darkneſſe would be leſſe intolerable:
but now, that the
beames of the glorious Goſpell
haue ſhined thus long,
thus bright in our faces; Oh
me, what can we plead againſt
our owne confuſion? Oh
Lord, where ſhall we appeare,
when thy very mercies aggrauate
our ſinnes, and thy iudgements.
                  Why ſhouldſt thou not expect
fruit from a Vineyard ſo choſen,

ſo husbāded, &amp; wo worth
our wretchedneſſe that haue
thus repayd thee; Be confounded
in thy ſelfe, O my Soule,
bee confounded to ſee theſe
deplored retributions; Are
theſe Grapes for a God? Doe
yee thus requite the Lord, O
fooliſh people and vniuſt;
Hath hee for this made vs the
mirrour of his mercies to all
the World, that we ſhould ſo
ſhamefully turn his graces into
wantonneſſe? Are theſe
the fruites of his choyce, his
Fencing, his Reforming, his
Planting, his watch Towre,
his Winepreſſe?Dan 9. 4. O Lord; the
great and dreadfull God, keeping
the couenants, and mercies
to them that loue thee,
we haue ſinned, and committed

iniquitie, and haue rebelled,
by departing from thy
precepts, and from thy iudgements;
Oh Lord, righteouſneſſe
belongeth to thee, but
vnto vs confuſion of faces, as
at this day; wee know, we acknowledge
how iuſt it may
bee with thee to pull vp our
hedges, to breake downe our
Wall, to root vp our Vines; to
deſtroy and depopulate our
Nation, to make vs the ſcorne
and Prouerbe of all Generations;
But O our God, Let
thine anger and thy fury bee turned
away from thy Ieruſalem,
                     Dan. 9. 16, 19. thy
holy Mountaine. O Lord heare,
O Lord forgiue, O Lord harken,
and doe: deferre not for thine
owne ſake, O our God, for thy
Citie, and thy people are called by
thy Name:
                  
                     
But alas, what ſpeake I of
not deferring, to a God of
mercie, who is more forward
to giue, then we to craue; and
more loath to ſtrike then wee
to ſmart, and when hee muſt
ſtrike, complaines, Why will ye
dye O houſe of Iſrael? Let mee
rather turne this ſpeech to our
ſelues; the delay is ours; Yet
it is not too late, either for our
returne, or his mercies; The
decree is not (to vs) gone
forth, till it bee executed; As
yet our Hedge ſtands, our
wall is firme, our Vine growes;
Theſe ſharpe monitions, theſe
touches of Iudgement haue
beene for our warning, not
for our ruine; Who knowes if
he will not returne, and yet
leaue a bleſſing behind him:

Oh that we could turne vnto
him with all our heart, with
Faſting, and with Weeping,
and with Mourning; Oh that
wee could truely and effectually
abandon all thoſe abhominable
Sinnes, that haue ſtirred
vp the Anger of our God
againſt vs; and in this our day,
this day of our ſolemne humiliation,
renue the Vowes of
our holy and conſcionable obedience:
Lord God, it muſt
bee thou onely that muſt doe
it; Oh ſtrike thou our flintie
hearts with a ſound remorſe,
and melt them into teares of
penitence for al our ſins; Conuert
vs vnto thee, and we ſhal
be conuerted; Lord heare our
Prayers, and regard our teares,
and reforme our Liues, and

remoue thy Plagues, and renue
thy louing countenance,
and continue &amp; adde to thine
old mercies, Lord affect vs
with thy fauours, humble vs
for our Sinnes; terrifie vs with
thy Iudgements; that ſo thou
maiſt hold on thy fauours,
and forgiue our Sinnes, and
remoue thy Iudgements; euen
for the ſake of the Sonne
of thy loue Ieſus Chriſt
the righteous, to
whom, &amp;c.

                  SInce it ſeemed good to that
Great Court, to call this
poore Sermon (amongst others,
of greater worth) into the
publike Light; I haue thus ſubmitted
to their pleaſure: And

                  This worke preceded (ſome

                     I am crucified with Chriſt. Neuertheleſſe
I liue, &amp;c.
                  
                  
                     HEE that was
once toſſed in
the confluēce
of two Seas,
Acts 27. 41.
was once no
leſſe ſtraited
in his reſolutions betwixt life and
death, Philip. 1. 23. Neither doth
my Text argue him in any other
caſe here; As there he knew not
whether hee ſhould chooſe, ſo

here hee knew not whether hee
had. I am crucified, there hee is
dead: yet I liue, there he is aliue
againe; Yet not I, there he liues not;
but Chriſt in mee, there hee more
then liues. This holy correction
makes my Text full of wonders,
full of ſacred riddles. 1. The liuing
God is dead vpon the croſſe,
Chriſt crucified; 2. St. Paul who
dyed by the ſword, dyes on the
croſſe. 3. St. Paul who was not
Paul till after Chriſts death, is yet
crucified with Chriſt. 4. St. Paul
thus crucified yet liues. 5. St. Paul
liues not himſelfe, whiles he liues;
6. Chriſt who is crucified, liues in
Paul; who was crucified with
him.
                  See then here both a Lent, and
an Eaſter; A Lent of mortification,

                     I am crucified with Chriſt. An
Eaſter of reſurrection, and life, I
liue, yet not I, but Chriſt liues in mee:
The Lent of my Text will bee
ſufficient (as proper) for this ſeaſon;
wherein my ſpeech ſhall
paſſe through three long ſtages of
diſcourſe: Chriſt crucified, St. Paul
crucified, St. Paul crucified with
Chriſt. In all which, your Honorable
and Chriſtian patience, ſhall
as much ſhorten my way, as my
care ſhall ſhorten the way to
your patience.
                  Chriſts croſſe is the firſt leſſon
of our infancy, worthy to bee our
laſt, and all: The great Doctor
of the Gentiles affected not to fly
any higher pitch. Grande crucis ſacramentū,
as Ambroſe. This is the
greateſt wonder that euer earth,

or heauen yeelded. God in carnate
was 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,1 Tim. 3. 16. but God
ſuffering, and dying was ſo much
more, as death is more penall then
birth: The Godhead of man, and
the blood of God are two ſuch
miracles, as the Angels of heauen
can neuer enough looke into,
neuer admire enough.
                  
                     Ruffine tells vs that among the
ſacred characters of the Egyptians,
the croſſe was anciently
one, which was ſaid to ſignifie
eternall life; hence their learneder
ſort were conuerted to, &amp; confirmed
in the faith. Surely, we know
that in Gods Hieroglyphicks, eternall
life is both repreſented, and
exhibited to vs by the Croſſe.
That the Croſſe of Chriſt was
made of the tree of life, a ſlip

the Angels gaue to Adams ſonne,
out of Paradiſe, is but a Iewiſh
legend; Galatine may beleeue it,
not wee; but; that it is made the
tree of life to all beleeuers, we are
ſure; This is the onely ſcale of
heauen; neuer man aſcended thither,
but by it. By this, Chriſt
himſelfe climbd vp to his owne
glory. Dominus regnauit a ligno, as
Tertullian tranſlates that of the
Pſalme; Father glorifie thy name,
that is ſaith he, Duc me ad crucem,
Lift me vp to the tree, not of my
ſhame, but of my triumph. Behold,
we preach Chriſt crucified (ſaith
St. Paul) to the Iewes a ſtumbling
blocke, to the Greekes, fooliſhneſſe; but
to them which are called, Chriſt the
power of God, and the wiſdome of God
1 Cor. 1. 23. Fooliſh men, that

ſtumble at power, and deride
wiſedome. Vpbraid vs now ye
fond Iewes and Pagans, with a
a crucified Sauiour; it is our glorie,
it is our happineſſe; which ye
make our reproch: had not our
Sauiour dyed, he could haue bin
no Sauiour for vs; had not our
Sauiour dyed, we could not haue
liued; See now the flagge of our
deare Redeemer, this Croſſe, ſhining
eminently, in loco pudoris, in
our forheads: and if we had any
place more high, more conſpicuous,
more honourable, there
we would aduance it. O bleſſed
Ieſu, when thou art thus lifted vpon
thy croſſe, thou draweſt all
hearts vnto thee: there thou leadeſt
captiuity captiue, and giueſt
giueſt gifts vnto men. Yee are

deceiued O yee blind Iewes and
Paynimes, ye are deceiued; It is
not a gibbet, it is a throne of honour,
to which our Sauiour is
raiſed. A throne of ſuch honour,
as to which heauen and earth,
and hell, doe and muſt veile. The
Sun hides his awfull head, the
earth trembles, the rockes rend,
the graues open, and all the frame
of nature doth homage to their
Lord in this ſecret, but diuine
pompe of his crucifixion▪ And
whiles yee thinke his feet and
hands deſpicably fixed, behold,
he is powerfully trampling vpon
hell and death, and ſetting vp
trophees of his moſt glorious victory;
and ſcattering euerlaſting
Crownes, and Scepters vnto all
beleeuers: O Sauiour, I doe rather

more adore thee, on the Caluary
of thy paſſion, then on the
Tabor of thy transfiguration, or
the Oliuet of thine aſcenſion: and
cannot ſo affectuouſly bleſſe thee
for Pater clarifica, Father glorifie
me, as, for, My God, my God, why
haſt thou forſaken me; ſith it is no
newes for God to bee great, and
glorious; but, for the eternall and
euer-liuing God, to be abaſed; to
be abaſed vnto death, to the death
of the croſſe, is that which could
not but amaze the Angels, and
confound Deuills, and ſo much
more magnifies thine infinit mercie,
by how much an infinite
perſon would become more ignominious.
All Hoſannaes of
men, all Alleluiahs of Saints and
Angels come ſhort of this Maieſticke

humiliation: Bleſsing,
honour, glory, and power be vnto him
that ſits vpon the throne, and to the
Lambe for euer, and euer, Reuel. 5.
13. And yee (honorable and
beloued) as euer ye hope to make
muſicke in heauen, learne to tune
your harpes to the note and ditty
of theſe heauenly Elders; Reioyce
in this, &amp; reioyce in nothing but
this croſſe; not in your tranſitory
honors, titles, treaſures, wch will
at the laſt leaue you inconſolately
ſorrowfull; but in this croſſe of
Chriſt; whereby the world is
crucified to you, and you to the
world. Oh clip and embrace
this precious croſſe with both
your armes, and ſay with that
bleſſed Martyr, Amor meus crucifixus
eſt, my loue is crucified.

Thoſe that haue ſearched into the
monuments of Ieruſalem, write
that our Sauiour was crucified
with his face to the Weſt; which
howſoeuer ſpightfully meant of
the Iewes, (as not allowing him
worthy to looke on the holy Citie
and Temple) yet, was not
without a myſtery;His eyes looke to the Gentiles &amp;c. 
                     Oculi eius ſuper
Gentes reſpiciunt ſaith the Pſalmiſt;
As Chriſt therefore on
his croſſe look't towards vs ſinners
of the Gentiles; ſo let vs look
vp to him; Let our eyes be lift vp
to this brazen ſerpent, for the cure
of the deadly ſtings (of that old
ſerpent: See him, O all ye beholders;
ſee him hanging vpon the
tree of ſhame, of curſe, to reſcue
you from curſe, and confuſion,
and to feoffe you in euerlaſting

bleſſedneſſe: ſee him ſtretching
out his armes to receiue, and embrace
you; hanging downe his
head to take view of your miſery,
opening his precious ſide to receiue
you into his boſome, opening
his very heart to take you in
thither, pouring out thence water
to waſh you, and blood to
redeeme you: O all ye Nazarites
that paſſe by, out of this dead Lyon,
ſeeke and find the true honey
of vnſpeakable, and endleſſe
comfort.
                  And ye great Maſters of Iſrael,
whoſe lips profeſſe to preſerue
knowledge, leaue all curious and
needleſſe diſquiſitions, and with
that diuine and extaticall Doctor
of the Gentiles, care onely to
know, to preach, Chriſt and him
crucified.
                  
                     
But this, though the ſumme of
the Goſpell, is not the maine drift
of my Text: I may not dwell
in it, though I am loath to part
with ſo ſweet a meditation:
From Chriſt crucified turne your
eyes to Paul crucified; you haue
read him dying by the ſword;
heare him dying by the croſſe;
and ſee his morall, ſpirituall, liuing
crucifixion.
                  Our Apoſtle is two men, Saul
and Paul; The old man, and the
new; in reſpect of the old man
he is crucified and dead to the
law of ſinne; ſo as that ſinne is
dead in him; neither is it otherwiſe
with euery regenerate. Sin
hath a body, as well as the man
hath, (who ſhall deliuer mee from
this body of death? Rom. 7. 24. A

body that hath limmes, and
parts; Mortifie your earthly members,
ſaith our Apoſtle, Coloſ. 3. 5. Not
the limmes of our humane body,
which are made of earth, (ſo
ſhould wee bee hoſtes naturae, as
Bernard) but the ſinfull limmes,
that are made of corruption, Fornication,
vncleanneſſe, inordinate affection,
&amp;c. The head of ſinne
is wicked deuices; the heart of
ſinne, wicked deſires; the hands
and feet of ſinne, wicked executions;
the tongue of ſin, wicked
words; the eyes of ſinne, luſtfull
apprehenſions; the forehead of
ſinne, impudent profeſſion of euill;
the backe of ſinne, a ſtrong
ſupportation and maintenance
of euill; all this body of ſinne is
not onely put to death, but to

ſhame too; ſo as it is dead with
diſgrace; I am crucified. St. Paul
ſpeaks not this ſingularly of himſelfe,
but in the perſon of the renued;
ſinne, doth not, cannot liue
a vitall, and vigorous life in the
regenerate. Wherefore then (ſay
you) was the Apoſtles complaint

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      &amp;c. wretched man that I
am, who ſhall deliuer me from this body
of death? Marke, I beſeech you;
it was the body of ſin; not the life
of ſinne; a body of death, not the
life of that body; Or if this body
had yet ſome life, it was ſuch a
life, as is left in the limmes when
the head is ſtruck off; ſome dying
quiuerings, rather as the remainders
of a life that was, then any
act of a life that is: Or, if a further
life, ſuch a one as in ſwounds,

and fits of epilepſie, which yeelds
breath, but not ſenſe; or if ſome
kind of ſenſe, yet no motion, or
if it haue ſome kinde of motion
in vs, yet no manner of dominion
ouer vs. What power, motion,
ſenſe, reliques of life are in a fully
crucifyed man? ſuch a one may
waft vp and downe with the
winde, but cannot mooue out of
any internall principle.
                  Sinne and grace cannot more
ſtand together in their ſtrength,
then life and death: In remiſſe
degrees all contraries may bee
lodged together vnder one roofe;
Saint Paul ſweares that he dies
daily, yet he liues; ſo the beſt man
ſinnes hourely, euen whiles hee
obeyes; but the powerfull and
ouer-ruling ſway of ſinne is incompatible

with the truth of regeneration.
Euery Eſau would
be carying away a bleſſing; No
man is willing to ſit out. Ye ſhall
haue ſtrong drinkers, as Eſay calls
them, Eſay 5. 22. Neighing ſtallions
of luſt, as Ieremy calls them,
Ier. 5. 8. Mighty hunters in oppreſſion,
as Nimrod, Gen. 10. 9.
rotten talkers, Epheſians 4. 9.
which yet will be challenging as
deepe a ſhare in grace, as the conſcionableſt:
Alas how many
millions doe miſerably delude
themſelues with a meere pretēce
of Chriſtianity; aliter vivunt, aliter
loquuntur, as he ſaid of the Philoſophers.
Vaine hypocrites, they
muſt know that euery Chriſtian
is a crucified man: How are they
dead to their ſinnes, that walke in

their ſins? how are their ſinnes
dead in them, in whom they ſtir,
raigne, flouriſh? Who doth not
ſmile to heare of a dead man that
walkes? Who derides not the ſoleciſme
of that Actor, which expreſt
himſelfe fully dead by ſaying
ſo? What a mockery is this?
eyes full of luſt, itching eares, ſcurrilous
tongues, bloody hands,
hearts full of wickedneſſe, and
yet dead? Deceiue not your
ſolues deare Chriſtians, if ye loue
them; This falſe death is the
way to the true eternall, incomprehenſibly-wofull
death of body
and ſoule: If yee will needs
doe ſo, walke on ye falſly dead,
in the wayes of your old ſinnes,
be ſure, theſe pathes ſhall lead you
downe to the chambers of euerlaſting

death; if this be the hanging
vp of your corruptions, feare
to hang in hell. Away with this
hatefull ſimulation; God is not
mocked; Yee muſt either kill, or
dye. Kill your ſinnes; or elſe they
will bee ſure to kill your ſoules,
apprehend, arraigne, condemne
them; faſten them to the tree of
ſhame; and, if they be not dead already,
breake their legs &amp; armes,
diſable them to all offenſiue actions;
as was done to the theeues
in the Goſpell; ſo ſhal you ſay wth
our bleſſed Apoſtle, I am crucified.
                  
                  Neither is it thus onely in matter
of notorious crime, and groſſe
wickedneſſe, but thus it muſt be
in the vniuerſall cariage of our
liues, and the whole habituall
frame of our diſpoſitions; In

both theſe, we are, we muſt bee
crucified. Bee not deceiued my
brethren, it is a ſad and auſtere
thing to bee a Chriſtian; This
worke is not frolicke, iouiall,
plauſible; there is a certaine thing
call'd true mortification, required
to this buſineſſe; and who euer
heard but there was paine in
death? but, among all deaths, in
crucifying? what a torture muſt
there needs be in this act of violence?
what a diſtention of the
body, (whoſe weight is racke
enough to it ſelfe?) what ſtrayning
of the ioynts? what nayling
of hands and feet? Neuer make
account to bee Chriſtians without
the hard taskes of penitence.
It will coſt you teares, ſighes,
watchings, ſelfe-reſtraints, ſelfe-ſtruglings,

ſelfe-denyalls: This
word is not more harſh then
true; Yee delicate hypocrites,
what doe yee talke of Chriſtian
profeſſion, when ye will not abate
a diſh from your belly, nor
ſpare an houres ſleepe from your
eyes, nor caſt off an offenſiue rag
from your backes for your God?
In vaine ſhall the vaſſals of appetite
challenge to be the ſeruants of
God: Were it that the Kingdome
of God did conſiſt in eating, and
drinking, in pampering and ſurfets,
in chambering and wantonneſſe,
in prancking and vanity, in
talke and oſtentation: Oh God
how rich ſhouldeſt thou bee of
ſubiects, of Saints? But if it require
abſtinence, humiliation, contrition
of heart, ſubiugation of our

fleſh, renunciation of our wills,
ſerious impoſitions of laborſome
deuotions; O Lord, what is
becomne of true Chriſtianity?
where ſhall we ſeeke for a crucified
man? Looke to our Tables,
there yee ſhall finde exceſſe and
riot; Looke to our backs, there
yee ſhall finde proud diſguiſes,
looke to our conuerſation, there
ye ſhall finde ſcurrile and obſcene
iollity: This liberty, yea this licentiouſneſs
is that, which opens
the mouthes of our aduerſaries,
to the cenſure of our real impiety;
That ſlander which Iulian could
caſt vpon Conſtantine, that 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
led him to 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      delicacie, to intemperance,
the very ſame doe
they caſt vpon vs: they tell vs of
their ſtrict Lents, frequent faſtings,

Canonicall houres, ſharpe
penances, their baſhfull ſhrifts,
their painefull ſcourgings, their
ſolitatie Cells, their woolward
and barefoot walkes, their hard
and tedious pilgrimages, whiles
wee (they ſay) deny nothing to
backe or belly; fare full, lie ſoft, ſit
warme, and make a wantō of the
fleſh, whiles we profeſſe to tend
the ſpirit. Brethren, heare a little
the words of exhortation: The
bragges of their penall will-worſhip
ſhall no whit moue vs; All
this is blowne away with a
Quis requiſiuit? Baals Prieſts did
more then they, yet were neuer
the holyer: But for our ſelues,
in the feare of God ſee that we do
not iuſtifie their crimination;
whiles they are in one extreame,

placing all Religion in the outſide,
In touch not, taſte not,
handle not; let not vs be in the
other, not regarding the externall
acts of due humiliation: It
is true that it is more eaſie to
afflict the body, then to humble
the ſoule; A dramme of remorſe
is more then an ounce of paine:
O God, if whippings, and haire-clothes,
and watchings would
ſatisfie thy diſpleaſure, who
would not ſacrifice the blood of
this vaſſall (his body) to expiate
the ſinne of his ſoule? who
would not ſcrub his skin, to eaſe
his conſcience? who would not
freeze vpon an hardle, that hee
might not fry in hell? who
would not hold his eies open, to
auoid an eternall vnreſt and torment?

But ſuch ſacrifices and
oblations, O God, thou deſireſt
not; The ſacrifice of God is a broken
ſpirit; a broken and a contrite heart
O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe; Yet it is
as true, that it is more eaſie to
counterfeit mortification of ſpirit,
then humiliation of body;
there is paine in the one, none in
the other: He that cares not therfore
to pull downe his body, wil
much leſſe care to humble his
ſoule; and hee that ſpares not to
act meet and due penalties vpon
the fleſh, giues more colour of the
ſoules humiliation. Deare Chriſtians,
it is not for vs to ſtand vpon
niggardly termes with our
Maker, he will haue both; He
that made both, will haue vs crucifyed
in both; The old man

doth not lie in a limme, or facultie,
but is diffuſed through the
whole extent of body and ſoule,
and muſt bee crucified in all that
it is.

Time; If ye haue ſoundly

you an wholſome and ſauing

ye muſt giue peremptorie denyalls

put your knife to your throat in

                     Salomons ſenſe. Thinke not that
ye can climbe vp to heauen with
full panches, reaking euer of Indian
ſmoake, and the ſurfets of
your gluttonous crammings and
quaffings; Oh eaſie and pleaſant
way to glory; From our bed to
our glaſſe, from our glaſſe to our
boord; from our dinner to our
pipe, from our pipe to a viſit, frō
a viſit, to a ſupper, from a ſupper
to a play, from a play to a banquer,
from a banquet to our bed:
Oh remeber the quarrell againſt
damned Diues; hee fared ſumptuouſly
euery day; hee made neither
Lents, nor Embers 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
as he ſaid, euery day was gaudie
and feſtiuall, in rich ſutes, in daintie
morſels, and full draughts, Intus
mulſo,
                     Wine within, Oyle without. 
                     foris oleo, as he ſaid; now

all the world for a drop, and it is
too little. Vae ſaturis, woe to the
full, ſaith our Sauiour; but euen
nature it ſelfe could abhominate,
bis de die ſaturum, One that is full
twiſe a day. One of the ſinnes
of our Sodom is fulneſſe of bread:
What is the remedy? It is an old
word, that hunger cures the diſeaſes
of gluttony. Oh that my words
could preuaile ſo farre with you,
Honourable and beloued Chriſtians,
as to bring auſtere abſtinence
and ſober moderation into
faſhion; The Court and Citie
haue led the way to exceſſe, your
example ſhall preſcribe, yea adminiſter
the remedie;Cic. de Fin. The heathen
man could ſay, hee is not
worthy of the name of a man
that would bee a whole day in

pleaſure; what, and we alwaies?
In faſting often, ſaith St. Paul;
what, and wee neuer? I faſt
twiſe a weeke, ſaith the Phariſee,
and wee Chriſtians, when? I
ſpeake not of Popiſh mock-faſts,
in change, not in forbearance; in
change of courſer cates of the
land, for curious dainties of the
water, of the fleſh of beaſts, for
the fleſh of fiſh; of vntoothſome
morſells for ſoruitiunculae delicatae,
as Hierome cals them; Let me neuer
feaſt, if this bee faſting; I
ſpeake of a true, and ſerious maceration
of our bodies, by an abſolute
and totall refraining from
ſuſtenance; which howſoeuer in
it ſelfe it bee not an act pleaſing
vnto God, (for well may I inuert
St. Paul, neither if we eat not, are we

the better, neither if we eate, are we
the worſe, 1 Cor. 8. 8.) yet, in the
effect it is; ſingulare ſanctitatis aratrum,
as that Father termes it; The
plow beares no Corne, but it
makes way for it; it opens the
ſoile, it teares vp the briers, and
turnes vp the furrowes; Thus
doth holy abſtinence; it chaſtiſes
the fleſh, it lightens the ſpirit, it
diſheartens our vicious diſpoſitions,
it quickens our deuotion.
Away with all factious combinations;
Euerie man is maſter of
his owne maw; Faſt at home,
and ſpare not, leaue publike exerciſes
of this kinde to the command
of Soueraigne powers;
Blow the trumphet in Zion, ſanctifie
a faſt, ſaith Ioel 2. 15. Surely this
Trumpet is for none but Royall

breath; And now (that, what I
meant for a ſuit, may be turned to
a iuſt gratulation) how doe wee
bleſſe the God of heauen, that
hath put it into the heart of his
Anointed to ſet this ſacred trumpet
to his lips: Neuer was it,
neuer can it bee more ſeaſonable
then now. Now that wee are
falne into a warre of religion;
Now that our friends and Allies
grone either vnder miſ-cariage,
or danger; Now that our diſtreſſed
neighbours implore our help
in teares, and bood; Now that
our God hath humbled vs with
manifold loſſes; Now, that we
are threatned with ſo potent enemies;
Now that all Chriſtendome
is embroyled with ſo miſerable
and perillous diſtempers;

Oh now it hath ſeaſonably pleaſed
your Majeſtie to blow the
Trumpet in Zion, to ſanctifie a
faſt, to call a ſolemne Aſſembly;
The miraculous ſucceſſe that
God gaue to your Maieſtie and
your Kingdome, in this holy exerciſe,
may well incourage an
happy iteration; How did the
publike breath of our faſting
prayers cleanſe the aire before
them? How did that noyſome
peſtilence vaniſh ſuddenly away,
as that which could not ſtand
before our powerfull humiliations?
If we bee not ſtrained in
our owne bowels, the hand of
our God is not ſhortned; O
Daughter of Zion,
                     Ier. 6. 26. 
                     gird thee with
ſackcloth, and wallow thy ſelfe in
aſhes, make thee mourning and moſt

bitter lamentation; Faſt and pray
and proſper: And in the meane
time, for vs, let vs not thinke it
enough to forbeare a meale; or to
hang downe our heads like a
bulruſh for a day; but let vs
breake the bands of wickedneſs,
and in a true contrition of ſoule
vow &amp; performe better obedience.
Oh then, as wee care to
auert the heauie iudgements of
God, from our ſelues, and our
land, as we deſire to traduce the
Goſpell with peace, to our poſteritie;
Let each man humble one;
Let each man rend his heart,
with ſorrow for his owne ſins,
and the ſinnes of his people;
Shortly, let euery man 
                        •
                     anſacke
his owne ſoule, and life, and offer
and holy violence to all thoſe ſinfull

corruptions which haue ſtirred
vp the God of heauen againſt
vs; and neuer leaue til in truth of
heart, he can ſay with our bleſſed
Apoſtle, I am crucified.
                  
                  Ye haue ſeene Chriſt crucified,
St. Paul crucified, ſee now both
crucified together, I am crucified
with Chriſt; It is but a cold word,
this, I am crucified; it is the company
that quickens it: He that is
the life, giues it life, and makes
both the word, and act glorious,
I am crucified with Chriſt.
                  
                  Alas! there is many a one
crucified, but not with Chriſt;
The couetous, the ambitious
man is ſelfe-crucified; hee plots
a crowne of thorny cares for his
owne head; he peirces his hands
and feet with toyleſome, and

painful vndertakings, he drencheth
himſelfe with the vineger, &amp;
gall of diſcontentmēts, he gores
his ſide, and wounds his heart
with inward vexations: Thus
the man is crucified, but with the
world, not with Chriſt.
                  
                  The enuious man is crucified
by his owne thoughts; he needes
no other gibbet, then another
mans proſperitie; becauſe anothers
perſon, or counſell is preferred
to his, he leapes to hell in his
owne haltar; This man is crucified,
but it is Achitophels croſſe,
not Chriſts.
                  
                  The deſperate man is crucified
with his owne diſtruſt, hee
pierceth his owne heart with a
deepe, irremediable, vnmittigable,
killing ſorrow; hee payes his

wrong to Gods iuſtice with a
greater wrong to his mercy, and
leapes out of an inward hell of
remorſe, to the bottomleſſe pit of
damnation. This man is crucified;
but this is Iudases croſſe, not
Chriſts.
                  
                  The ſuperſtitious man is profeſſedly
mortifyde; The anſwer
of that Hermite in the ſtorie is
famous, why doſt thou deſtroy
thy body? becauſe it would deſtroy
mee; Hee vſeth his body,
therefore, not as a ſeruant, but a
ſlaue; not as a ſlaue, but an enemie:
He lies vpon thornes, with
the Phariſee; little eaſe is his lodging,
with Simeon the Anachoret;
the ſtone is his pillow, with Iacob,
the teares his food, with exiled
Dauid; hee lanceth his fleſh

with the Baalites, hee digges his
graue with his nayles; his meales
are hunger, his breathings ſighes,
his linnen haire-cloth, lined and
laced with cords, and wires; laſtly,
hee is his owne willing tormentor,
and hopes to merit heauen
by ſelfe-murder. This man
is crucified, but not with Chriſt.
                  The Felon, the traitor is iuſtly
crucified, the vengeance of the
law will not let him liue; The
Ieſuiticall incendiary, that cares
onely to warme himſelfe by the
fires of States, and Kingdomes,
cryes out of his ſuffering; The
world is too little for the noyſe
of our crueltie, their patience;
whiles it iudgeth of our proceedings,
by our lawes, not by our
executions; but if they did ſuffer

what they falſly pretend, (as they
now complaine of eaſe) they
might be crucified, but not with
Chriſt, they ſhould bleed for ſedition,
not conſcience: They
may ſteale the name of Ieſus, they
ſhall not haue his ſociety; This
is not Chriſts croſſe, it is the croſs
of Barabbas, or the two malefactors
(
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ) Marke 15. 7.
All theſe and many more are crucified,
but, not as St. Paul was
here, with Chriſt. How with
Chriſt? In partnerſhip, in perſon:
In partnerſhip of the ſuffering;
euery particularity of
Chriſts crucifixion is reacted in
vs. Chriſt is the modell, wee
the mettall; the mettall takes ſuch
forme as the modell giues it: ſo
are we ſpread vpon the croſſe of

Chriſt, in an vnanſwerable extenſion
of all parts, to dye with
him, as the Prophet was vpon
the dead childe, to reuiue him.
Superſtitious men talke of the
impreſſion of our Sauiours
wounds in their Idol St. Francis:
This is no newes; St. Paul; and
euery beleeuing Chriſtian hath
both the laſh
                        ••
                     , and wounds, and
transfixions of his Ieſus wrought
vpon him; The crowne of
thornes pierces his head, when
his ſinfull conceits are mortified;
His lippes are drencht with gall,
&amp; vineger, when ſharpe &amp; feuere
reſtraints are giuen to his tongue:
His hands and feet are nayled;
when hee is by the power of
Gods Spirit diſabled to the wonted
courſes of ſinne; His body

is ſtripped, when all colour and
pretences are taken away from
him; ſhortly, his heart is pierced,
when the life blood of his formerly-raigning
corruptions is
let out. Hee is not true Chriſtian
that is not thus crucifyed with
Chriſt.
                  Woe is me, how many faſhionable
ones are not ſo much as
pained with their ſinnes; It is no
trouble to them to blaſpheeme,
oppreſſe, debauch. Yea, rather it
is a death to them to thinke of
parting with their deare corruptions;
The world hath bewitched
their loue; That which Eraſmus
ſaith of Paris, that after a man
hath acquainted himſelfe with
the odious ſent of it (hoſpitibus
magis ac magis adlubeſcit) it grows

into his liking more and more;
is too true of the world, and ſenſuall
mindes: Alas, they rather
crucifie Chriſt againe, then are
crucified with Chriſt. Woe to
them that euer they were; for being
not dead with Chriſt, they are
not dead in Chriſt; and being not
dead in Chriſt, they cannot but
dye eternally in themſelues; For
the wages of ſinne is death: death
in their perſon, if not in their
ſurety. Honorable and beloued,
let vs not thinke it ſafe for vs to
reſt in this miſerable and deadly
condition; As yee loue your
ſoules, giue no ſleepe to your
eyes, nor peace to your hearts, till
ye finde the ſenſible effects of the
death, &amp; Paſſion of Chriſt your
Sauiour, within you, mortifying

all your corrupt affections, and
ſinfull actions, that yee may truly
ſay with St. Paul, I am crucified
with Chriſt.
                  
                  Sixe ſeuerall times doe wee
finde that Chriſt ſhed blood; In
his Circumciſion, In his Agonie,
In his Crowning, In his Scourging,
In his Affixion, In his
Transfixion. The inſtrument
of the firſt was the Knife; Of
the ſecond, vehemence of Paſſion;
Of the third, the Thornes;
Of the fourth, the Whips; Of the
fift, the nailes; Of the laſt, the
Speare: In all theſe we are, we
muſt bee partners with our Sauiour.
                  In his Circumciſion; when
we draw blood of ourſelues by
cutting off the foreskinne of our

filthy (if pleaſing) corruptions.
Coloſ. 2. 11.
                  In his Agony, when we are
deeply affected with the ſenſe of
Gods diſpleaſure for ſinne, and
terrified with the frownes of an
angry Father.
                  In his crowning with thornes,
when we ſmart, and bleed with
reproches for the name of Chriſt;
when that which the world
counts honor, is a paine to vs,
for his ſake; when our guilty
thoughts puniſh vs, and wound
our reſtleſſe heads, with the ſad
remembrance of our ſins.
                  In his ſcourging, when we
tame our wanton, and rebellious
fleſh, with wiſe rigor, and holy
ſeuerity.
                  In his Affixion, when all the

powers of our ſoules, and parts
of our body, are ſtrictly hampered,
and vnremoueably faſtened
vpon the Royall Commandements
of our Maker, and Redeemer.
                  In his Transfixion, when our
hearts are wounded with diuine
loue (with the Spouſe in the Canticles)
or our conſciences, with
deepe ſorrow.
                  In all theſe, wee bleed with
Chriſt; and all theſe (ſaue the
firſt onely) belong to his crucifying.
Surely, as it was in the old
Law (
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ) without
blood ſhed there was no remiſſion
(Heb. 9. 22.) ſo it is ſtill, and
euer, in the new. If Chriſt had
not thus bled for vs, no remiſſion;
If wee doe not thus bleed

with Chriſt, no remiſſion.
                  There is no benefit, where is
no partnerſhip. If Chriſt therefore
bled with his agony, with
his thornes, with his whips, with
his nayles, with his ſpeare, in ſo
many thouſand paſſages, as tradition
is bold to define, &amp; we neuer
bleed, either with the agony
of our ſorrow, for ſinne; or the
thornes of holy cares for diſpleaſure;
or the ſcourges of ſeuere
Chriſtian rigour, or the nayles of
holy conſtraint, or the ſpeare of
deepe remorſe; How doe wee,
how can we, for ſhame, ſay, we
are crucified with Chriſt?
                  
                  Diuine St. Auſtin,
                     Epiſt. 120. ad Honoratum. in his Epiſtle,
or booke rather to Honoratus,
giues vs all the dimenſions of the
Croſſe of Chriſt; The latitude

he makes in the tranſuerſe; this
(ſaith hee) pertaines to good
workes; becauſe on this his
hands were ſtretched.
                  The length was from the
ground to the tranſuerſe, this is
attributed to his longanimitie,
and perſiſtance, for on that, his
body was ſtayed, and fixed.
                  The height was in the head of
the croſſe, aboue the tranſuerſe;
ſignifying the expectation of ſupernall
things.
                  The depth of it, was in that
part, which was pitcht below
within the earth, importing the
profoundneſſe of his free grace,
which is the ground of all his
beneficence. In all theſe muſt we
haue our part with Chriſt; In
the tranſuerſe of his Croſs, by the

ready extenſion of our hands to
all good works of piety, iuſtice,
charity. In the Arrectary, or
beame of his Croſſe, by continuance,
and vninterrupted perſeuerance
in good; In the head of his
croſſe, by an high-eleuated hope,
and looking for of glory; In the
foot of his croſſe, by a liuely and
firme faith, faſtening our ſoules
vpon the affiance of his free
grace, and mercy; And thus ſhall
we be crucifyed with Chriſt, vpon
his owne Croſſe.
                  Yet laſtly, wee muſt goe further
then this, from his Croſſe to
his perſon.
                  So did St. Paul, and euery beleeuer,
dye with Chriſt, that hee
died in Chriſt: For, as in the firſt
Adam we all liued, and ſinned; ſo

in the ſecond all beleeuers dyed,
that they might liue.
                  The firſt Adam brought in
death to all mankinde, but, at laſt,
actually dyed for none but himſelfe;
The ſecond Adam dyed for
mankind, and brought life to all
beleeuers. Seeſt thou thy Sauiour
therefore hanging vpon the
Croſſe, all mankinde hangs there
with him; as a Knight or Burgeſs
of Parliament voyces his whole
Burrough, or Countrey: what
ſpeake I of this? The armes and
legges take the ſame lot with the
head; Euery beleeuer is a limme
of that body; how can he therefore,
but dye with him, and in
him? That reall vnion, then, wch
is betwixt Chriſt and vs, makes
the croſſe and paſſion of Chriſt,

ours. So as the thornes pierced
our heads, the ſcourges blooded
our backs, the nayles wounded
our hands &amp; feet, and the ſpeare
gored our ſides, and hearts: By
vertue whereof, we receiue iuſtification
from our ſinnes, and true
mortification of our corruptiōs.
Euery beleeuer, therefore, is dead
already for his ſins, in his Sauiour;
he needs not feare that he ſhal dy
againe. God is too iuſt to puniſh
twiſe for one fault; to recouer the
ſum both of the ſurety, and principall:
All the ſcore of our arerages
is fully ſtrucke off, by the
infinite ſatisfaction of our bleſſed
Redeemer; Comfort thy ſelfe,
therfore thou penitent, and faithful
ſoule, in the confidence of thy
ſafety; Thou ſhalt not dy but liue,

ſince thou art already crucifyed
with thy Sauiour; He dyed for
thee, thou dyedſt in him; Who
ſhall lay any thing to the charge of
Gods elect? It is God that iuſtifies?
Who ſhall condemne? It is Chriſt
that dyed; yea rather, that is riſen
againe, and liues gloriouſly at the
right hand of God, making interceſſion
for vs: To thee ô bleſſed Ieſu,
together with thy Coeternall
Father, and holy Spirit, three
perſons in one infinite, and incomprehenſible
Deitie; be all
praiſe, honour, and glory,
now, and for euer.
Amen.
