            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            TO THE MAIST NOBILL AND WORTHIE Lord, Iohne Erle of Marr, Lord Erskin, and Regent to the Kingis Maiestie, his Realme and liegis, zour humbill subiect Dauid Fergusson, wischis the fauour and lufe of God throuch Christ our Sauiour, togidder with prosperous Gouernament and all felicitie.
            ALBEIT my mynd nor purpois was not (richt Nobill and worthie Lord) to haue publischit this sermō at ony time, zit becaus it did not fructifie as I supposit it suld haue done, being (as sayis Ezechiel) lyke a tone or plesant sang to the heirers for a season, thair hartis in the meane time still going efter their couetousnes, prouokit also be the malitious toungis of sū, &amp; eirnestly requeistit be vtheris. At lenth I was compellit (for farther instructioun of the negligent heireris, the stopping of the mouthis of euill speikeris, and the satisfactioun of the incessant requeistis of gude and godlie men) to bestow and spend sum time &amp; trauel, to put it in that same forme

&amp; ordour, that it was spokin and preichit in befoir zour Grace. Quhilk quhē I had faithfully performit (as all thay that hard it, quhen thay sall reid it agane I trow will testifie) distrusting myne awin iudgement I presentit it to the Kirk now laitly assemblit in Perth the sext of August that thay quha (for the maist part) wer heireris of it micht iudge asweil of the soundnes of the doctrine contenit into it, as of my sinceritie in the wryting thairof, and sa micht allow, or disallow it, as it meritit, vnto the quhilk besines the Kirk appointit Iohne Erskin of Dun Superintendent of Angus, M. Iohne Dowglas Bischop of Sanctandrois, M. Iohne Winram Superintendent of Stratherne, M. Knox Minister of Edinburgh, and Williame Christison Minister of Dundie, quha diligently red and approuit the same, subscriuing it with thair handis, in the Name of the haill Kirk, as a Sermon consonant and aggreabill to Goddis word. Quhairof I haue takin bauldnes to publische it and that, vnder zour Graces name (to quhome the patrocinie &amp; defēce of godlynes and vertew belangis) to ye end it may be the mair acceptabil to gude mē,Rom. 13. and that wickit men may be the mair affrayit

to calumniate or defame it, not that I greitlie regaird the iudgement of men, hauing the testimonie of a gude consciēce for my warrand,2. Cor. 4. bot that I iudge it profitabill to seik all ordinarie meanis that be lawful to mantene the treuth and promot Goddis glorie.
            Zour humanitie and gentilnes, quhairof not only I, bot almaist all vther men, haue experience, muifis me to be sa hamely as to offer and dedicate sa small a wark vnto zour Grace, douting nathing but that ze will accept &amp; regaird it rather according to the qualitie &amp; substāce thairof nor according to the quantitie of it or ye persone of the wryter: quhilk quhen I sall vnderstād it will prouoke and incourage me to present zour Grace sum day with a greiter wark and a larger Volume as a perpetuall monumēt of my vnfenzeit lufe &amp; affectiō to zour Grace. The Lord Iesus preserue ye Kingis Maiestie, comfort and assist zow yt ze may be a bill to execute zour charge to the glorie of God and the commoditie of this pure Realme. Amen.

               FROM the dayis of zour Fatheris,Verse. 7. ze ar gone away from myne ordinances, and haue not keipit thē: returne vnto me, &amp; I will returne vnto zow, saith ye Lord of hostes: but ze said, quhairin sal we returne? Will a man spoyle his Godis?8. Zit haue ze spoyled me: But ze say, quhairin haue we spoyled thee? In teindis and offeringis. Ze ar cursed wt a curse:9. for ze haue spoyled me, euin this whole Natioun.
               Bring ze all the teindis into the stoirhous,10. that thair may be meat in myne hous, and proue me now heir with, saith the Lord of Hostes, if I will not oppin the windowes

                  12. And all Nation is sall call zow blissed: for ze salbe a plesand land saith the Lord of Hostes.
            
            
               ¶THE ARGVMENT.
               LYKE as the wyse and trustie Medecineris, or the faithfull and trew Chirurgianis do not luke sa mekle (in ministratioun of thair Phisik or in applicatioun of thair Salues and Plaisteris) vnto the presēt plesure or pane of thair patientis, as vnto thair profite, sa intend I this day nouther sa mekle to auoide or seik ony of thir twa, as to profite the body of Christ (quhilk is his Kirk) tuiching that maledie and sair,Ephes. 1. quhilk in my Iudgement, at this present maist cheifly vexis and anoyis it, not that I coūt my self abill or sufficient sa to do, but that being callit to occupy this place, in trauelling to do it, I may schaw my gude will and frelie vtter my mynd, in this mater vnto zow all,Prouerb 16. according to gods word, leuing the incres to him that wirkis all

thingis to his glorie and the cōmoditie of thame that lufe him,Rom. 
                        •
                     . and thairfoir that I may the mair cōmodiously performe my purpois I haue chosin this Text of Scripture, now red in zour audience, preichit of auld be the Prophet Malachie vnto the Kirk of God,The ordour or diuisioun of this text. in the like stait that we now ar in, the principall partis quhairof ar thir, first he perswadis thē to repentance with  argumentis proper and cōuenient to mufe them thairunto, Secundly he cōfutis thair  rebellious answeris, &amp; schawis thē planely quhairin thay cheifly did offend. Thridly  he exhortis them maist eirnestlie to amēd the faultis that he laid to thair charge, promysing vnto thame gif thay do sa, the benedictioun of God and aboundance of all thingis. This is ye groūd or ordour quhilk our Prophet, I say, obseruis, quhilk also I purpois presentlie to follow as God of his mercy will minister his graces vnto me.
               ¶From the dayis of zour Fatheris, ze ar  gone away from myn ordinances. &amp;c.
               The purpois of our Prophet is, first of all (as I haue said) to perswade his brethrē the Iewis to repentance and conuersioun to God, of quhais grace and mercy onlie it was, that thair name and natioun was to

be foūd in eirth, vnrutit out and cōsumit, as thay ar taucht in the verse precedant, but becaus it is but loste laubour to craue repentance of thame that think not thame selfis giltie, acknawledges na fault cōmittit, nor estemis that thay haue ony neid of amendement, Thairfoir he dois let thame vnderstand thair estait and that thay of all vther men, had maist neid of repentance and amendement of lyfe, becaus thay wer not only transgressouris of Goddis Law thame selfis, but also, that baith thay and thair Fatheris befoir thame, had vnto that day departit from the haly ordinances &amp; Lawis of the Lord, sa that this was na vncouth or new thing that happinnit vnto thē, but ane inueterat &amp; auld euill quhilk from age to age thay wer inclynit and naturally geuin vnto, in the quhilk thay did euin then still continew, following in that cace thair progenitouris, quhome thay in thair maneris na les viuely resemblit then gif thay had remanit thame selfis aliue vnto that hour, forasmekle as in thē planelie appeirit that same stifneckitnes and vncircumcisioun of hartis and earis, quhair with thair Fatheris (as sayis the constant Martir Steuin) alwayis resistit the haly Gaist,Act. 7. we

se then brethren that the Prophetis purpois is not only to conuict thame of defectioun from God, but also to let thame vnderstand that it was als natural for thame to rebell aganis God, as to be thair fathers sonnis, for, as we vse to say, thay had it be kynd and coft it not, and zit sa far absent wer thay from acknawledgeing of this, yt thay almaist, culd neuer be brocht to grāt it, no not then, quhen it was euin bound, as it wer, on thair backis. Of this we leirne, that lang custome to sinne, is a thing maist pernitious, for it makis that thing, quhilk of the self, is maist abhominable to appeir nathing to thame that ar hantit thairwith, specially if God defer punischment ony quhyle, for then beginnis man to flatter him self, to abuse the patience of God, &amp; to wrap him self in that cairles and maist perrillous perswasioun, that God regairdis not his doingis, nor is thairwith sa heichly offendit as the Scripture beiris, and sa procedis to heap sinne vpon sinne vntil ye day of wraith, zea, thairof cūmis it (as sayis Salomon) that the hartis of men, ar fully set in thame to do euill becaus sentēce aganis ane euill wark is not spedelie execute,Rom. 2. for this caus,Ecclesi. 8. the Prophet first trauellis to walkin

vp thir pepill from this wickit perswasioun that his exhortatioun to repentance micht tak the better effect.
               Vnto the exhortatioun to repentance, quhairin the Lord desyris thē to returne to him, is addit a promeis, to wit, that he will returne vnto thame, that thay thairby may be assurit that thair repentāce sall not be vnprofitable, for as it is, but loste laubour and a vane purpois, to perswade men to repent that acknawledgis na fault (as we haue said befoir) sa na les vane is it to exhort to repentance, albeit the sinne wer grātit, quhair thair is na hope nor assurāce of mercy, for quhair na certitude of forgiuenes is, bot only a bair knawledge and horrour of sinne, the myndis of men ar rather thairby dreuin to disperatioun nor to repentance,Gen. 3. 1. Sam. 26. &amp; 31. 2. Sam 17. Math. 27. as appeiris in Cain, Saull, Ahitophell, Iudas and diueris vtheris. Thairfoir amangis the cheif articklis of our faith that ar vtterly necessar to be beleuit vnto saluatioū this ane amang the rest is coūtit, namely, to beleue, the remissioū of sinnis. Of this place then, we leirne quhat is richt and trew repentance, to wit, conuersioun vnto God, quhilk as it is the richt definitioun of repentance, sa seruis it to confute ye
                  
conuersioun to creatures, and all the vaine theatricall toyis prescribit in papistrie to penitentis, quhair of I mynde not at this present particularlie to speik, seing that it is a cōmoun place continually taucht vnto zow in the Catechisme, and also becaus I purpois to intreit ane vther mater cōtenit in this Text mair at lenth.
               Nouther is it to be pretermittit that the Prophet vpbraidis the pepill of his tyme with the wickitnes and rebellioun of thair foir fatheris, quhilk suppois it appeir at the first to be vncurteously &amp; vniustly done, zit gif we considder quhat maner of men he had to do with, we fall se that he was iustlie mouit sa to do, for first the pepill yt he delt with, wer Hypocrites that boistit and gloryit of the Richteousnes of thair Fatheris, and vnder the pretence thairof leuit maist licentiously and wickitly, thinking it aneuch that thay wer discendit of haly and verteous Fatheris. Thairfoir he is compellit to lat thame se quhat maner of men thair Fatheris wer, to the end that thay micht the mair eirnestly prepair thē selfis to repentance, quhill thay suld se ye cloik takin away quhilk thay supposit yai had vnder the tytill of thair foirbearis.

And in this sens do not only the Prophetis in the auld Testament,Psalm. 78. Isai. 1. Ierem. 9. Zacharie. 1. Mat. 3. &amp; 23. Iohn. 8. Act. 7. frequentlie cast the faultis of the Fatheris, in the teith of the Iewis, bot also Iohne ye Baptist, Christ and his Apostillis do the same in the new Testament as in thair sermonis &amp; doctrine euidently appeiris. Secundly, thir pepill followit the futesteppis of thair Fatheris in doing of euill, or ellis the prophet wald not haue delt sa rigorously with them, for thocht a wickit man (as sayis Ezechiell) beget a sone,Ezechi. 1
                        •
                     , zit gif he feare and cōmit na sic wickitnes, his Fatheris impietie sall not be laid to his charge, bot gif he follow his Fatheris euill exampill then will the Lord visite the iniquitie of the Father vpon the sone.Exod. 10. Thairfoir maist iustly (say I) ar thir pepilis wickit Fatheris castin in thair teith becaus thay ar found in ye lyke wickitnes.
               ¶Mairouer we haue heirof to obserue how vane a thing it is to boist of our progenitouris, seing that thair ar nane of all our Fatheris, quhais lyues being straitly examinit but that thair salbe found in thame mater a neuch to thair cōdempnatioun, &amp; also occasioun a neuch to abate that pryde quhilk we ar wount fulischelie to consaue of thair halynes, it teachis vs also how far

furth we may without danger follow thē yt haue passit befoir vs, to wit, sa far furth as they obey God and his worde, vtherwayis thair exampill will not serue to excuse vs, becaus the langer that wickitnes continew, and the ma that do commit it, it is the mair abhominabill in Goddis sicht, and the neirer vnto vengeance. And this mekle being spokin for the first part lat vs proceid to the secund.
               But ze said quhairin sall we returne? &amp;c. Albeit that thir pepill wer giltie, and had offendit God ma wayis then ane, as the crymes laid to thair charge, be the Prophet in the Chapteris precedant, testifyis, zit becaus he dois specifie, na particulare cryme now in this place, thay begyn to quarrell with him according to thair accustomit maner, and to answer him as thay had done at all vther tymes, demanding quhairin thay suld returne? Na vtherwise nor thay had bene giltles, &amp; had bene rebukit without a caus. Thairfoir that thay may be na mair dissauit and blindit with sa gros ignorance, the Prophet declairis vnto them that besyde all the rest of thair sinnis, quhilk wer mony, thay wer fallin in a new offence (quhilk thair Fatheris for all

thair wickitnes neuer attemptit) namelie sacriledge, in that thay outher fraudulētly retenit that quhilk was sanctify it and dedicatit to God and to his worschip, or elis conuertit and turnit the same to vther vsis nor was appointit. Quhairin albeit thay monyfauldlie offendit, zit dois ye Prophet comprehend all vnder the name of teindis and oblatiounis, becaus thay specially wer euill payit and withaldin from Godis Ministeris the Preistis and Leuitis,Nam. 18. to quhome the teindis, oblatiounis, and first frutis appertenit be the Law of God, besyde all vther thingis that the Lord appointit vnto thame asweil for the Sacrifices,Deut. 14.

And thairfoir had thay na vther inheritāce in Israell, then to defraud them thairof it was nane vther thing bot to spuilze them of that quhilk God had geuin them as ane heritage for thair seruice qubairwith thay seruit him in the Tabernackle of the Congregatioun, quhairunto thay had als gude richt as ony mā in Israell had to his feild or Wynezaird.

                     . as he hes promysit in his worde, quhairof we fall haue better occasioun to speik in the thrid heid of our Text vnto

the quhilk let vs now proceid: wearie not I pray zow, suppois the tyme be almaist spendit for I sall not be lang.
               
                   ¶ Bring ze all the teindis into the stoirhous, &amp;c. Efter that the Prophet hes cō
                  futit the vniust querrellingis and responsis of the pepill and also had prouit thame criminall, he schawis thame the remedie and how thay may recouer agane the benedictioun and fauour of God, to wit, gif thay will deill vprichtly with him in time cūming, quhairunto he maist ernistly exhortis thame, promysing (gif thay will amend the former faultis) Goddis blyssingis and fauour in all thingis. Bring ze (sayis he) all the teindis into the stoirhous, or treasure of the Tempill, he craifis all, that thay may knaw that he will haue nane fraudulently withdraw in as thay wer befoir, quhen for the fossoun thay gaue a part, as thocht thay had benezealous of Religioun, and retenit the rest to satisfie thair auaritious affectioūis. The caus quhy that the Lord commandis all the teindis faithfully to be geuin without ony fraud, he sayis, yt thair may be meit in his hous to sustene the Preistis and the Leuitis that waitit on his seruice, and that thair may

be sufficient also for all vther thingis that he had appointit in his Law to be done, quhairof we haue spokin at lenth afoir. This is it that the Lord requyris of thir pepill, and exhortis thame to proue him heir withall. Quhidder gif he will not oppin vnto them the wyndois of heuin. &amp;c. Behald deir Brethren the bountifulnes &amp; familiaritie of our God toward vs, yt this way subiectis his fidelitie to our tryall, binding him self be promeis to recōpance and that largely, quhatsaeuer is bestow it on his seruice, thocht he be detter to no man, nor zit hes ony commoditie of our oblatioūis (as we haue said afoir) for nouther dwellis he in Tempilis maid with hā
                  dis,Act. 7. &amp; 17. nor zit hes he ony neid that our gudis be spendit on him,Psalm. 10. bot all the externall worschipping is ordanit be him for the nurischement of our faith, quha be eirthlie thingis mon be taucht peice and peice to vnderstand heuinly thingis that thairunto be thame, we may be led, as it wer, be the hand. For vs then, I say, is the externall exercise of Religioun, and all the expensis that is maid thairupon ordanit, and not for him, and zit notwithstanding in exhorting vs to be liberall in that quhilk

cūmis altogidder to our a win profite, he speiks als submissiuely as it wer a borower making requeist to a lenner, that wald say, len me, I pray zow, sic a summe of money or samekle victuall to sic a day and proue my credite thairwith, quhidder gif I will not thankfully pay zow agane and yt with profite. O the meruellous and vnspeikabill cair that the Lord hes ouer vs and our Saluatioun.
               Bot let vs heir with quhat benefitis he promysis to recompance thame gif thay will do thair dewtie. First, he promysis to oppin the wyndowis of heuin vnto them, he sayis not that he wil oppin a wyndow, bot in the plurall number wyndowis, signifying, that he will caus all thingis that thay haue neid of thairoutof to flow vnto thame in all aboundance. Secundly, that the blyssingis quhilk he will powre out of heuin vpon thame, sall produce and bring furth frute out of the eirth (not simplie to satisfie thair neid) bot mekle mair, zea, it salbe bezond measure. Thridly, he promysis that not only sall the heuin and the eirth mutually aggre togidder, (as sayis ye Prophet Hosea) to produce all thingis aboundantly vnto thame,Hosea. 2. bot also quhen

thay ar producit he sall preserue them frō all thingis that may hynder thame from cumming to maturitie and perfectioun, quhidder it be noysum beistis or vnseasonabill wedder. Finally, he promysis sa to deill with thame that the prophane and godles Natiounis salbe compellit to acknawledge thame for a happy and a blyssit pepill in quhome Goddis liberall blyssingis and benefitis sa sall abound, that the plesandnes, fertilitie &amp; fruitfulnes of thair land sall allure all men to lufe it and to desyre to dwell in it.
               Of this we note from quhence cummis aboundance of victuall, incres of frutis, &amp; all vther prosperitie to man, certanely not from the elementis abuse, nor from the earth beneth, nor zit from mānis laubour, (for the heuinis as sayis Ieremie can giue na schouris,Ieremiah. 14 and then of force it mon follow that the earth salbe barrane &amp; mānis laubour loist) from nane of thir thingis then procedis mānis happynes, bot from God only in quhais hand is the brydill yt moderatis all thingis, quha also (quhen man is obedient to him) makis all his creaturis to serue him,Iob. 5. zea, the stanis of the feild (as sayis Iob) to be in league with

him, and the beistis of the feild to be at peace with him. And be the cōtrarie quhē men ar inobedient to God thay ar cursit in all that euer thay put thair hand vnto,Deut. 28. and all the creaturis of God ar enemeis vnto thame, zea, the heuin geuis thame nouther dew nor raine, nor the earth ony frute mair nor thay wer maid of Iron and brasse.Leuit. 26. Let vs then brethren feir God, reuerence and worsship him as he hes commandit and be zealous to mantene his honour with all our poweris and substance, and sa sal he prosper our interprysis to his glorie and our comfort, bot gif we be disobedient to him, cairles and negligent of his honour, his plagues can not depart frō vs, for he will honour thame that honour him, and powre contempt vpon thame yt lichtly him.1. Samuel. 2. Langer at this present, seing that the tyme faillis me I will not hald zow, bot beseikis zow all, and principallie zow maist Nobill and worthie Personages to prēt thir thingis in zour myndis to zour profite, to suffer the wordis of exhortatioū patiently,H
                        ••
                     os. 13. and tak in gude worth yt quhilk is spokin, albeit it haue bene sumquhat rudely and schairply vtterit, considdering that it procedit from the hart of him that

luifis and fauouris baith zow &amp; zour caus, remembring the saying of Salomon, oppin rebuke is better then secreit lufe,Prouerb. 26. and the woundis of a lufer mair faithfull then the kissis of ane enemie thocht thay be plesāt. God grant that the wordis quhilk ze haue hard wt zour outward eiris may be sa fixit in zour hartis, yt the frute thairof may heir efter appeir to the glorie of God, and ye cō
                  moditie of his Kirk, quhilk he hes redemit to him self be ye precious blude of his only &amp; weilbelovit Sone Iesus Christ our Lord &amp; only Sauiour, to quhōe with the father &amp; the haly Gaist be perpetual praise, glorie, &amp; honor baith now &amp; for euer. Amen
