            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

nor suche a mynde so well intendynge I

To this we ought to endeuoyre our

by the reason that we so often tymes shal

not so quick / so it be godly: let it not make

Christes peace. Let it not be profytable or
helpyng for y• disputacyon in diuynite / so

I doute greatly whether they thē selues
haue any sure answere y• they may make / 
seyng they differre in so many thynges amongest
thēselues. And those also whiche
amongest them be more wyse than other
do not thus answere: This ye shall do / 
this ye shall not do / but of this maner.
This in myne oppynion were the better / 
this I suppose to be tollerable. But if we
haue that symple and bryght eye whiche
the gospell speaketh of / if the house of
our mynde haue in it the candell of pure

of the comen welthe: or els whan
with punysshment acordyng to y• lawes / 
they punyssh malefactours &amp; yuell doers.
And yet bycause they can not chose but of
necessyte be occupyed and besyed in suche
thynges as be ioyned with the most vyle
dregges and fylthe of the erthe / and with
the besynesse of y• worlde / it is ieopardous
leste they do fall further from the centre
and marke / as leste they shulde make somtymes
warre for their owne pleasure / and
not for the comen welthe: leste vnder the
pretext of iustyce they shulde vse crueltye
vpon those whom they myght refourme
with mercy: leste vnder the tytle of lordshyp
they shulde pyll and polle those people
whose goodes they ought to defende.
And moreouer as Christ lyke y• fountayne
of euerlastyng fyre / doth drawe next vnto
hym the ordre of preestes / &amp; maketh them
of lyke nature / that is to say pure &amp; clene
from all corrupcyon of worldly dregges
and fylthynysse:The offyce of Sacerdotes. So in lyke case it is the
offyce of preestes / &amp; specially of y• hyghest / 
somoche as they can to call and drawe vnto
them those that be princes and haue
power and authorite. And if it fortune at
any tyme that warre do ryse sodaynly in

any place / let the bysshoppes endeuoyre
them selues so moche as in them is / eyther
to ende the stryues and varyaunces
without shedyng of bloode: or if that can
not be brought to passe / by reason of the
great stormes of worldly besynesse / yet let
them so do that as lytle bloode as may be
be shedde / and that the warre may shortly
be brought to an ende. In tymes paste
the bysshoppes authorite had place euen
in iuste punysshmentes / and hath goten
dyuers tymes (as saynt AugustyneAugustyne. playnly
in his epystle dothe testyfye) the malefactour
from the handes of temperall iuges.
For some thynges there be so necessary
vnto the ordre of the comen welthe
that partly yet Christe dyd dissymule at
them / and partly he put them from hym / 
and partly neyther approuynge nor disalowyng
them dyd in a maner wynke and
loke besyde them. He wolde not knowe
the money of Cesar nor ye scripture vpon
it.what thynges &amp; how farforth they apertayn to the heedes of the chyrche The trybute he cōmaūded to be payde
if it were due and dette / as though it lytle
pertayned to hym / so that god had his
dutye. The woman taken and founde in
adultery he neyther condempned neyther
openly absolued / but onely dyd byd her y•
she shulde no more do so. Of those whiche
were cōdempned of Pylate / whose bloode

he entremyngled amongest their sacryfyces / 
he neyther sayde it was well doone
nor yuell / but onely threttened euery man
that they shulde be punysshed with a lyke
distructyon if they dyd not amende.
            More ouer whan he was desyred to deuyde
the enherytaūce bytwene y• two bretherne / 
he plainly refused it as an vnworthy
thīg for hym to gyue iugemēt of such
grosse maters / whiche dyd teche thynges
heuenly. And also of the other parte there
be certayne thyngꝭ whiche he openly abhorred / 
as y• couetous phariseys / the ypocrytes / 
the prowde ryche folkes / sayeng
vnto them wo be vnto you. He neuer rebukedwhat thynges chryste openly rebuked.
y• apostels more sharply than whan
they wolde haue ben auēged / or whā they
were ambycious. whan they asked hym
whether they shulde cōmaunde fyre to be
sent downe frō heuen to haue burned vp
the cyte from whēce they were shyt forth / 
he answered &amp; said to thē / ye know not of

to haue called him vnto ye world from his
passyō suffrīg / he called him an aduersary.
whā they cōtēded about p̄eminēce which

many wayes dothe he call thē backe to a

whiche he teacheth &amp; cōmaundeth openly

to be obserued / as not to resyst yuel / to do
good to thyne enemyes / to vse mekenesse
of mynde / and other lyke. These muste be
departed in sondre / and euery of thē set in
ordre in his owne place.Princes lawes or of the mean sort of thinges Let vs not therfore
strayte wayes make Christe an auctoure
of all thynges whiche be done by
princes &amp; temporall offycers / nor defende
it (as we call it) to be done by goddꝭ lawe.
They deale and meddle with many thynges
whiche be lowe and grosse / not al togyther
of the very purenesse of a christen
man: yet they be not to be rebuked in as
moche as they be necessary to the maynteynaūce
of ordre to be obserued. Nor we
be not by the mynistrynge of their offyce
made good / all be it that by thē it is caused
that we be lesse yuell / and that they
whiche be yuell do lesse hurte &amp; noyaunce
to the comen welthe. And therfore they
also ought to haue their honour bycause
they do somwhat serue the iustyce of god
and the publyke and comen tranquilyte / 
without the which somtyme those thynges
be troubled &amp; vexed whiche belonge
to godly holynesse. They must be honoured
whan they do their offyce: and if somtymes
they vse their power for their own
plesure or profyte / yet ꝑaduenture it were
the best to suffreEuell rulers must be suffred them / leste more hurte

shulde spring therof: for there apereth an
ymage or rather a shadowe of the diuyne
iustyce in them / whiche iustyce yet ought
to shyne more euydently and more purely
in the lyuynge and lawes of preestes. An
ymage dothe of another maner shewe in
a myrrour of glasse / than it dothe in yron.
And in the thyrde cyrcleThe thyrde Cyrcle. must al the comen
people be / as the moste grosse parte of all
this worlde / but not yet so grosse but that
they pertayne vnto the mistycall body of
Christ: for the eyen be not only membres
of the body / but also the legges / the fete / 
and the priuy partes. And those whiche be
in the thyrde cyrcle we ought so to suffre
in their infirmyte / y• as moche as is possyble
we do call them vnto those thynges
whiche be more approued of Christe. For
in the mistycal body he that but late was
the foote may be the eye. And lyke as the
princes if they be not al the best / must not
with chyding be exasperate / leste (as saint
Augustyne saythe) whan they be moued
they styrre vp more peryllous tragedyes / 
so the weake people lyke as Christ suffred
his apostels and nourysshed them / muste
be suffred / and after a fatherly maner cherysshed
vntyll they were more aged and
strōge in Christ.The weake must be forborne. For godlynesse also hath
his infancye / it hath mene age / it hath full

strength and perfyte age. yet all men after
their degre muste endeuoyre them selfe to
attayne and come vnto Christe. The elementes
haue euery one his propre place / 
but the fyre which hath the hyghest place
by lytell and lytell draweth all the other
vnto hym / and so moche as he can tourneth
them in to his nature.The chaūge of one Elemente in to an other. The clere
water he tourneth in to the ayre / and
the ayre clarifyed he transfourmeth into
his owne nature. Saynte Paule dothe
in many thynges suffre and pardon the
Corynthyans / but in the meane season
puttynge difference bytwene those thynges
whiche he dyd profer in the name of
his lorde vnto them that were perfyte / 
and those thynges whiche he dyd pardon
that were written in his owne name
to them that were yet weake &amp; yonge in
Christ: but euer on this trust y• they shulde
profyte and go forwarde to more strength
and perfectyon. And also he trauayleth
agayne to bringe forthe the galathyans
vntyll Christe be fassyoned in them.
            Nowe if any man wyll thynke this cyrcle
to be more conuenyent for princes / I
wyll not stryue greatly with hym. But
what so euer is without the thyrde cyrcle
is at all tymes and in all poyntes to be
hated and refused / as ambycion and desyre

of money / lechery / yre / vengeaunce / 
enuy / backbytyng / and suche other pestylences / 
whiche than onely be made incurable / 
whan they disgysed with the vyser
and cloke of holynesse &amp; vertue do crepe in
to the cyrcle afore spoken: that is whan
vnder the pretexte of executynge the lawe
and iustyce we vse our tyranny. whan by
the occasyon of religyon we prouyde for
great lucre. whan vndre the tytle of defendyng
the churche we hunte for worldly
power and authoryte: and whan soeuer
those thynges be commaunded as
thynges pertaynyng vnto Christ whiche
be disagreynge moche from his lernynge.
Therfore the marke muste be sette before
euery man whiche they ought to shote
at: and there is but one markeThe marke maye not be chaunged. / whiche
is Christe and his moste pure lernynge.
If thou sette forthe a worldly marke in
the stede of a celestyall marke / than shall
there be nothyng whervnto a man ought
iustly enforce hym selfe / whiche laboureth
to profyte and go forwarde. Euery
man ought to enforce hym selfe to that
whiche is best and moste perfyteAl must labour to perfytnesse. / that at
the leste we maye attayne and come to
the meane thynges. And there is no cause
whye we shulde put awaye any kynde
or maner of lyuynge from this marke.
            
               The perfectyon of Christ consisteth onely
in the affectes / &amp; not in the maner or kynde
of lyuing: it consysteth in the myndes and
not in the garmentes or in meates &amp; drinkes.
There be amonge the monkꝭ whiche
be scarce able to be put in ye thyrde cyrcle / 
and yet I speke of those whiche be good /

amōgest these that haue had two wyues
whiche Christe thynketh worthy for the
fyrst cyrcle. Nor yet in the meane tyme I

professyon / though I propounde and set
forth afore euery man that thyng whiche
is best and most perfyte: Onlesse ye wolde
thīke Plato to haue done iniury agaynst
all cytes bycause in his boke of the gouernynge
of a cyte or a comen welthe / he fayned
suche example of a comen welthe / as
yet neuer any man coude se. Or except ye
do thynke that Quintilian hath hurt the
hole ordre of oratours / bycause he feyned
suche an example of an oratour as yet neuer
was. And though thou be farre from
the princypall and chefe patron Christe / 
thou arte not yet therfore caste away / but
extymulate &amp; moued to go forwarde and
profyte. Arte thou nere the marke? than
art thou monysshed and counsayled to aproche
more nere: for there was neuer yet

any man that went so farre forwarde / but
that he might haue gone moch more nere
the marke. There is no kynde of lyuynge
but it hath some peryllous poyntes annexed
vnto it / to cause men to degenerate
from the truth: and who so euer sheweth
those ieopardous and daungerous poyntes / 
dothe not derogate or mynisshe thonour
of the ordre / nor speake agaynste it / 
but rather is for the profyte therof. As the
felicyte of princesThe comen vyces of princes is in daūger to fall into

sheweth those daungers to be eschewed / 
doth deserue thankes of the ordre of princes.

they make a couer and a cloke to malyciousnesse.

vnto you in Frobentus printe / as though
it were newe borne agayne / moche more
ornate and better corrected than it was

Me thought it moste couenyent to dedycate
this edycion (suche as it is) vnto you
that who soeuer shall take any preceptes
to lyue well of Erasmus / shulde haue an
example redy at hande of our father Uolzius.
Our lorde preserue you good father / 
the honour and worshyp of all religyon.
I pray you coūsayle Sapidus that he be
wyse / that is / that he go forthe as he hath
begonne: and to wynphelyngus ye shall
speke also / that he prepare all his armure
to fyght shortely with the turkes / for as
moche as he hath kepte warre longe ynoughe
with kepers of concubynes. And
I haue great hope and truste to se hym

and to be set hygh in honour with a mytre

               maunde

to expell hym out of thy pauylyon. This
felowe must be watched with an hondred

or cite of god for deuils to entre in. Seyng

how whan thou were bounde with his

what entent was the sygne of the crosse
prynted in thy foreheed / but that as long

anoynted with his holy oyle / but that
thou for euer sholdest wrastle and fyght
agaynst vyces. what shame &amp; how greate
abomynacyon is it accoūted with al men

aduersary. with what face sumest thou

whiche for thy sake bestowed his owne
lyfe. who so euer is not on his part / as he
sayth hymselfe Luce. xj. standeth agaynst

scatereth abrode. Thou warrest not onely
with fylthy tytle or quarell / but also for a

And I beseche the now small is y• rewardeComparacyon of rewardes.
whiche those wretched men go aboure to
gete with so great ieopardyes &amp; diligence
Ueryly but to haue prayse of a wretched
man theyr captayn / &amp; that they myght be
praysed with a rude &amp; homely song / suche
as are vsed to be made in ye tyme of warre
to haue happely theyr names wryten in a
harpers bederoll / to gete a garlande of
grasse or oken leues / or at y• most to bryng
home a lytell more vaūtage or wynnyng
with them. we on the other syde clene cō
                  trary
be kendled neyther with shame nor
hope of reward / and yet he beholdeth vs
whyle we fight that shal quyte our payne
yf we wynne the felde. But what rewarde
setteth forth the chefe ruler of our game
for them that wynne the maystry / not mules
as Achylles dyd in Homere / not tripodas / 
that is to say / meate bordes with. iij.
fete / as Eneas dyd in Uirgil: but suche as
the eye neuer sawe / ne ye eare neuer herde / 
neyther coude synke in to the hert of man.
And these rewardes he gyueth in y• meane
seasō to his (whyles they be yet fyghting)
as solaces and thynges to cōforte them in
theyr labours &amp; trauayles. And what here

after? certes blessed īmortalite. But in games
of sporte / as rennyng / wrastlyng / lepyng
/ in whiche ye chefest parte of rewarde
is prayse. They which be ouercōme / haue
lykewyse theyr rewardes assygned vnto
them. But our mater is tryed with great
and doutfull peryll / neyther we fyght for
prayse / but for lyfe / &amp; as rewarde of moost
valure is ꝓfred to hym that quyteth hym selfe
most manfully. So payne most terryble
is appoynted for hym y• gyueth backe.
Heuen is promysed to hym that fyghteth
lustely. And why is not the quick courage
of a gentyll stomacke enflamed with the
hope of so blessed a rewarde / namely whā
he promyseth / whiche as he can not dye / 
euen so he can not deceyue. All thynges be
done in the syght of god whiche al thyngꝭ
beholdeth.God beholdeth vs. we haue al the company of heuen
beholders of our cōflict. And how are
we not moued at the lestway euen for very
shame? He shall prayse our vertue &amp; diligēce / 
of whome to be landed is very felicite.
why seke we not this prayse / ye with
the losse of our lyues. It is a cowardfull
mynde that wyl be quickened with no maner
of reward. The veryest hertles cowarde
in the worlde / for feare of peryls oft tyme
taketh courage to hym. And in worldly
bataylles though thyne aduersary be

neuer so cruell / yet rageth he but on thy
goodes &amp; body onely. what more thā that
coude cruell Achylles do to Hector.Achilles slewe hector. But
here the imortall parte of the is assawted
and thy carkas is not drawen aboute the
sepulcre as Hectors / but thy body &amp; soule
is cast downe in to hell: there the greatest
calamite or hurt is / that a sworde shall separate
the soule frō the body. Here is taken
from thy soule the lyfe / whiche is god
hym self. It is natural for the body to dye
whiche yf no man kyll / yet must it nedely
dye. But thy soule to dye / is extreme mysery.
with how greate cawtell voyde we
the woūdes of the body / with how great
diligence cure we them / &amp; set we so lytell
of the woūdes of the soule.The deth of the body semeth terryble / the deth of the soule is not perceyued. Our hertes aryseth
&amp; grudgeth at the remembraūce of
deth of the body as a terrible or outragyous
thyng / bycause it is seen with bodyly
eyes. The soule to dye bycause no man
seeth &amp; sewe byleueth / therfore very fewe
feare it. And is this dethe more cruell yet
than the other. Euen as moche as the
soule dothe passe the body / &amp; god excelleth
the soule. Wylt thou that I shewe the cerceyn
coniectures / exāples or tokens wherby
thou mayst perceyue the sicknes &amp; deth
of the soule?The token of a sycke soule. Thy stomacke dygesteth yll / 
it kepeth no meate / thou ꝑceyuest by &amp; by

thy body to be out of temper. And breade
is not so naturall meate to thy body / as
the worde of god is meate for thy soule. yf
that seme bitter / yf thy mynde ryse against
it / why dourest thou yet but yt the mouth
of thy soule is out of taste / &amp; infected with
some disease. yf thy memory the stomacke
of thy soule kepe not the lernynge of god.
yf by cōtynual meditacyon thou digestest
not. yf whan it is dygested / thou sendest it
not to all partes by operacyon / thou hast
an euydēt token that thy soule is acrased.
whan thy knees for weyknes bow vnder
the / &amp; moche worke to drawe thy lymmes
after the / thou ꝑceyuest playnly thy body
to be euyll at ease. And doest thou not perceyue
the sycknes of thy soule whan he
grudgeth and is weyke and faynte to all
dedes of pite / whan he hath no strengthe
to suffre pacyently the leest rebuke in the
worlde / and is troubled &amp; angry with the
losse of a halfpeny. After that the syght is
departed fro the eyes / &amp; the eares cease to
heare. After that all the body hath lost his
felyng: no man douteth than but the soule
is departed. whan the eyes of thy herte be
waxen dym / in so moche that thou canst
not se the most clerest lyght / which is vertue
or trouth. whā thou hearest not with
thy inwarde eares the voyce of god. whan

thou lackest all thy inwarde felynge and
ꝑceyuynge of the knowlege of god / thynkest
thou that thy soule is alyue. Thou
seest thy brother vngoodly entreated / thy

Therfore cōclude whan so euer deed wordes

For whan (accordyng to the gospell) the

that is to wyte god. In an other place of

homelynes of the style vnder rude wordes

by this properte is signyfyed the puryte &amp;
clennes of gods lawe. For there is no doctryne
of man whiche is not defyled with
some blacke spot of errour / onely the doctryne
of Chryst euery where bryght / euery

And no doubte it is a blessed thynge to folow

ꝑturbacions or mocyons of vnquietnes.Foure affections of the mynde Ioye sorowe hope and feare.
Of whiche the fyrst is voluptuousnes
(as he sayth) the bayte wherby men are
allured and brought to vngracyousnes or
mischefe. The next is sorowe or grefe whiche
letteth men / &amp; dryueth them from vertue
or goodnes. After that feare &amp; presumptuous

whome accōpanyeth indurate wroth / the
desyre of vengeaūce. More ouer flateryng
hope with beestly ymaginacyon &amp; knowlege
not gouerned of reason / and worldly
loue that layeth handes violently on all
thynges. These be almoost the wordes of
Plato / and it was not vnknowen to hym
the felicitie of this lyfe to be put in refraynyng
of suche ꝑturbacyōs / for he wryteth
in the same worke them for to lyue iustly &amp;
blessedly / whiche sholde haue ouercōme

&amp; myserably that sholde be ouercōme of

is a mater of fortytude.Perypotetici be Arystoteles folowers whiche saye a man apayled with all kīde of vtue &amp; with a pure cōsciēce to be a good man / yet not happy or blessed / for thei wyll beatitude to rest in the acte &amp; outward practise of vertue in ꝓfyting the cōenwelth Therfore saye they / ryches / frēdes / strēgth of body / helth / eloquence and such like to be required necessarily without whiche a man cannot ꝓfyte another / yet wolde they not suche thynges to be desyr
                        ••
                      for loue of the thingꝭ thē selfe but to profyte the comēwelth &amp; for the cōuersacyon of mankynde. Enuy is a greate
cause of polycy / &amp; in lykewyse of the other
Socrates in a certeyn booke that Plato
made called Phedo / semeth to agree with
Stoici / where he thynketh philosophy to
be nothyng else but a meditaciō or practisyng
of deth / that is to say / that the mynde
withdrawe her selfe as moche as she can
frō corporal &amp; sensyble thyngꝭ / &amp; cōuey her
selfe to those thyngꝭ whiche be perceyued
with reason onely / and not of the sensible
powers. Fyrst of al therfore thou must beholde
&amp; cōsyder diligently all the mocions
mouyngꝭ or steryng of thy mynde / &amp; haue
them surely knowen. Farthermore thou
must vnderstāde no mocyons to be so violent
but they may be eyther refrayned of
reason / or else turned to vertue. Notwithstanding
I heare euerywhere this contagrous
opinyon / that some sholde say they
be cōstrayned to vices: &amp; on the other syde
many for lacke of knowlege of them selfe
folowe suche mocyons as the sayinges or
decrees of reason: in so moch that what so
euer wrath or enuy doth coūseyle or moue
them to do / that they call the zele of god: &amp;

as thou seest one cōmun welth to be more
vnquiet than another:Some man is more prone to vtue then some so is one man more
enclyned or prone to vertue than another
whiche differēce cōmeth not of y• diuersite
of myndes / but eyther of the īfluence of celestial
bodyes / or els of our ꝓgenitours / or
els of the bryngyng vp in youth / or of ye cō
                  plectiō
of the body. The fable of Socrates
of carters &amp; horses good &amp; bad is none olde
wyues tale: for thou mayst se some to be
borne of so moderate / softe / quiet &amp; gentyl
disposicyon / so easy to be hādled / to be turned
&amp; wynded / that without besynes they
may be enduced to vertue / &amp; renneth forward
by theyr own courage without any
spurrynge.The rebellion of nature is to be imputed to no man. To some clene contrary thou
mayst ꝑceyue to haue happened: a body rebellyous
as a wylde &amp; kyckyng horse: in so
moche yt he whiche tameth him shal haue
ynough to do &amp; swete apace / and yet scarse
with a very rough bytte / scarse with a waster
&amp; with sharpe spurres can subdue his
fyersnes. If any suche one hath hapned to
the / let neuer ye rather thy hert fayle ye / but
so moche the more feruently set vpon it / 
thynkyng on this wyse: not that the way
of vertue is stopped or shutte vp from the:
but a larger mater of vertue to be offred
vnto the. But and yf so be that nature
hath endued the with a gentyll mynde / 

thou art. not therfore streyghtway better
than an other man / but happyer / and yet
agayn on that maner wyse art thou more
happy / so that thou art also more bounde.
How be it what is he yt is endued with so
happy gyftes of nature / whiche hath not
haboūdaūtly thynges ynough to wrestle
withal. Therfore in what parte shal be ꝑceyued
most rage or rebellyō to be / in that
parte reason our kynge must watche diligētly.Some vyces folowe the countres.
There be certeyn vices appropriate

One man is somwhat prone or enclyned
to pleasure of worldly pastymes / but
nothyng angry / nothyng enuyous at all.
An other is chaste / but somwhat proude or

whiche be vexed with certeyn wonderfull
&amp; fatall vices / with thefte / sacrylege &amp; homicyde:
whiche truly thou must withstāde
with al thy might / against whose assaulte
must be cast a certeyn brasen wall of sure
purpose. On the other syde some affectiōs
be so nygh neyghbours to vertue / that it
is ieopardous leest we sholde be deceyued

These affectiōs are to be corrected &amp; amended / 
&amp; may be turned very wel to that vertue
whiche they most nygh resēble. There
is some man (bycause of example) whiche
is soone set a fyre / is hote / at ones ꝓuoked

may be constant. Solempnes may be turned
to grauite. And that hath to moche of
folysshe toys / may be a good companyon.
And after ye same maner of other sōwhat

                      to ony maner of vyce. The onely
waye therfore to felicite is fyrst that thou
knowe thy selfe:knowe thy self. more ouer that thou do
nothyng after affections / but in al thyngꝭ
after the iudgemēt of reason:Do all thyngꝭ after the Iugement of reason let reason be
soūde &amp; pure &amp; without corrupcion: let not
his mouth be out of taste / that is to saye / 
let hym beholde honest thyngꝭ. But thou
wylie say: it is an harde thynge that thou
cōmaundest: who sayth naye? And veryly
the saying of Plato is true: what so euer

                  hynges be fayre and honest / the same be
harde &amp; trauaylfull to obteyne. Nothyng
is more harde than that a man shold ouer
cōme hymselfe.The sayeng of saynt Ierome. But than is there no greater
rewarde than is felicite. Iheronymus
spake that thynge excellently as he dothe
al other thynges: nothyng is more happy
than a chrysten man / to whom is ꝓmysed
the kyngdom of heuē: nothyng is in greater
peryll than he which euery houre is in
ieopardye of his lyfe: nothynge is more
stronge than he yt ouercōmeth the deuyll:
nothynge is more weyke than he that is
ouercōme of the flesshe. If thou ponder
thyne owne strengthe onely / nothynge is
harder than to subdue the flesshe vnto the
spiryte. If thou shalte loke on god thy
helper / nothynge is more easye. Than
now therfore cōceyue with all thy myght
and with a feruent mynde the purpose &amp;
professyon of the perfyte lyfe. And whan
thou hast groūded thy self vpon a sure purpose / 
set vpon it &amp; go to it lustely: mannes
mynde neuer purposed any thyng feruētly
that he was not able to bryng to passe.To be willyng to be a chrystē man is a grete parte of chrystendome.
It is a greate parte of a chrysten lyfe to
desyre with full purpose and with all his
herte to be a chrysten man / that thynge
whiche at the fyrst syght or metynge / at
the fyrst acqueyntaunce or commynge to

shall seme impossyble to be conquered or
wonne / in proces of tyme shall be gentyll
ynough &amp; with vse easy: in cōclusion with
custome it shall be very pleasaunt. It is a
very ꝓper saying of Hesiodus.The waye of vertue in proces wereth easye The waye
of vertue is harde at the begynnynge / but
after thou hast crept vp to the toppe there
remayneth for the very sure quietnes. No
beest is so wylde whiche wexeth not tame
by the crafte of man. And is there no craft
to tame the mynde of hym that is ye tamer
of all thynges. That thou myght be hole
in thy body / thou canst stedfastly purpose
and cōmaunde thy selfe for certeyn yeres
to abstayne frō drynkyng of wyne / to forbeare
the flesshe and company of women:
whiche thyngꝭ the phisician beyng a man
p̄scribed to the. And to lyue quietly al thy
lyfe canst thou not rule thyne affectiōs / no
not a fewe monethes? whiche thyng god
that is thy creatour &amp; maker cōmaundeth
the to do? To saue thy body from sycknes
there is nothyng which thou doest not: to
delyuer thy body &amp; thy soule also frō eternall
deth doest thou not these thyngꝭ whiche
infideles ethnici &amp; gentyles haue done.

maketh two men so coupled togyder / that
neyther without other can be outher in

deth of the one sholde be lyfe of the other.
To the same (as I suppose) perteyn those

than foloweth that whiche is spirituall.
The fyrst man came of the erthe
hym selfe terrestryall. The seconde came
from heuen and he hymselfe celestial. And
bycause it sholde more euydently appere
these thynges to pertayne not onely to

saying. As was the man of the erth / suche

This is ye olde debate of two twynnes
Iacob &amp; Esau / whiche before they were
brought forth in to lyght wrastled within
the cloysters of the mothers belly / &amp; Esau
veryly caught frō Iacob the preemynence
of byrth / &amp; was fyrst borne: but Iacob preuented
him agayn of his fathers blessing.
That whiche is carnall cōmeth fyrst / but
the spiritual thynge is euer best. The one
was reed / hygh coloured and rough with
heare

                   the other smothe. The one vnquiet
and a hunter: the other reioysed in domesticall
quietnes. And the one also for hunger

in yt he was the elder brother / 
whyle he en

                  ced with a vyle prest and rewarde
of voluptuousnes / fell from his natyue
libertye in to the bondage of synne.

The other procured by craft of grace that
whiche belonged not to hym by ryght of
law.But by the deuyce &amp; meanes of the mother Iacob stale awaye his fathers blessyng and was made lorde of his brother. Bitwene these two brethern though
bothe were borne of one bely / &amp; at one tyme / 
yet was there neuer ioyned ꝑfyte concorde / 
for Esau hateth Iacob / Iacob for
his parte though he quyteth not hate for
hate / yet he fleeth &amp; hath euer Esau suspected / 
neyther dare cōme within his daunger.Then came Esau waylyng to haue a blessynge / then answered the father. I haue made hym thy lorde.
To the lykewyse what so euer thyng
affection counseyleth or ꝑsuadeth / let it be
suspected. For the doutfull credence of the
counseylour Iacob onely sawe the lorde.After that Iacob sawe our lorde face to face.
Esau as one delytyng in blode lyueth by
the sworde. To cōclude whan the mother
asked counseyle of the lorde he answered:
the elder shall be seruaunt to y• yonger: but

sholde be mynded to purchace the fauour

&amp; euydent probacyon that this worde

onely. Paule nameth often the flesshe / often

onely frō lust of the body to chaste lyuyng
but enforceth to withdrawe them frō the
secte of of the iewes &amp; confydence of worke
in to whiche they were enduced by false
apostles. In this place therfore nōbrynge

he) be manyfest / whiche are fornycacyon / 
vnclenlynes / to be shameles / lechery / worshyppynge

longe after he sayth:Uayne glorye is a pestylence cōtrary to the spyryte. yf we lyue in the spiryte / 
let vs walke in the spirite. After that
as declarynge and vtterynge a pestylence

Liuius sayth) it fortuneth almoost euery

full to cōfesse the trouth) se we not all the
moste strayte kynde of monkes to put the

or in a certayne maner or forme

or in a labour of the body / whiche
monkes yf a man sholde examyne and appose

fynde any at all that walked not in the
flesshe. And here of cōmeth this so greate
infyrmytye of myndes / tremblynge for
feare where is no feare / and therin suertye
and careles where is moost peryll of
all: here of commeth the perpetuall infancye

that we preposterousPreposterous is settynge behynd that that shold be before estemers of thinges
make moost of suche thynges whiche by
them selfe are of no value: those sette at
nought whiche onely are suffycyent / euer
lyuynge vnder tuters or scholemaysters / 
euer in bondage / neuer aduaunsynge our
selfe vp to the lyberty of the spiryte / neuer
growynge vp to the large stature of charite:
whan Paule cryeth to a certeyn people
called Galathas / stande fast / be not ye
locked agayn vnder the yoke of bondage.
And in an other place the lawe was our
tutor or scholemayster in Chryste / that of
fayth we sholde be iustyfyed. But seynge
that faith is cōme / now we be no more vnder
a tutor or scholemayster: for euery one
of you (sayth he) is the veray sone of god
through fayth whiche he hath in Chryste
Iesu. And not moche after he sayth / &amp; we
also whan we were lytel ones were in seruice
and bondage vnder the ceremonyes &amp;
lawe of this worlde. But whan the tyme
was fully expyred / god sent his sone made
of a woman / made vnder the lawe to redeme
them whiche were vnder the lawe / 
that we by adopcyon sholde be his sones.
And for bycause ye be the sones of god / 
god hath sent the spiryte of his sone in to
your hertes / cryeng Abba pater (as a man
wolde saye dade father) And so is he not

now a seruaunt / but a sone to god. And
agayne in an other place. Bretherne ye be
called in to lybertye / let not your lybertye
be an occasyon vnto you to lyue in the
flesshe / but in charite of the spiryte serue
one an other: for all the lawe is fulfylled
in one sayinge. Loue thy neyghboure as
thy selfe / but and yf ye byte and eate one
the other / take hede leest ye be consumed
one of an other. And agayne to the Romaynes.
ye haue not receyued the spiryte
of bondage agayne in feare / but the spiryte
that maketh you the sones of god by
adopcion / in whome we crye dade father.
Unto the same also ꝑteyneth that he wryteth
to Timothe / sayenge. Exercyse thy
selfe vnder the dedes of pite: for bodyly
exercyse is good but for a small thynge / 
pite is good vnto all maner thynges. And
to the Corynthes. God is a spiryte / and
where the spiryte is / there is lyberty. But
why reherse I one or two places / whan
Paule is all togyder at this poynte / that
the flesshe whiche is full of contencyon
sholde be despysed / &amp; that he myght settle
vs in the spiryte whiche is the authour of
charite &amp; lybertye. For these companyons
be euer inseparable on the one syde / the
flesshe / bondage / vnquietnes / contencyon
or stryfe. And on the other syde the spyryte / 

peace / loue / lybertye. These thynges
euery where Paule mengleth with other
sayinges. And seke we a better mayster of
our relygyon / namely whan all dyuyne
scripture agreeth to hym? This was the
greatest cōmaūdemēt in the lawe of Moyses.
This Chryst iterateth and fynyssheth
in the gospell: &amp; for this cause chefely was
he borne:To loue is the gretest cōmaū
                     dement. for this cause dyed he to teche vs
not to coūterfayte the iewes / but to loue.
After the last souper made the euen before
his passyon / how diligently / how tenderly / 
&amp; how affectuously gaue he charge to
his discyples / not of meate / not of drynke / 
but of charite to be kepte one towardes
an other:Chryste last of all warneth vs of charyte. what other thynge techeth he / 
what other thynge desyreth his discyple.
Iohan than that we loue one an other.
Paule euery where (as I haue sayd) commendeth
charite / but specyally wrytynge
vnto the Corynthes he preferreth charite
bothe before myracles &amp; prophecyes / and
also before the tonges of aūgels. And say
not thou by and by that charite is / to be
oft at the churche / to croche downe before
the ymages of sayntes / to lyght tapers or
wax candels / to say many lady psalters or
saynt Katherynes knottes. God hath no
nede of these thynges.what is true charyte. Paule calleth charite
to edyfye thy neyghbour / to compte

that we all be membres of one body / to
thynke that we al are but one in Cryst / to
reioyse in god of thy neyghbours welthe
euen as thou doest of thyne owne. To remedy

But I heare euen now what certeyne
men (whiche are somwhat well aduised)
wyll answere vnto me. A man must
take hede in lytel and small thynges / leest
a lytell &amp; a lytell he sholde fall in to greater
vyces / I heare it ryght well / and I
alowe the saying / neuertheles thou oughtest
to take hede a greate deale more that
thou so cleue not to these lytell and small
thynges that thou sholdest fall clene from
the moost chefe &amp; greatest thynges.How farforth we ought to clene to the small thynges. There
is the ieopardye more euydent / but here
more greuouse. So flee Scilla that thou
fall not into Charibdis.Scilla &amp; charibdys loke what they meane at the ende of the fyrst chapytre. To obserue these
lytell thynges is holsome veryly: but to
cleue vtterly vnto them is veray ieopardous.
Paule forbiddeth not the to vse the
lawe and ceremonyes / but he wyll not
hym to be bounde to the lawe and ceremonyes
whiche is free in Chryste: he condempneth

not the lawe of dedes / yf a man

In thy body thou arte closed within

it to do good dedes outwarde / vnto

Therfore saythe he my people be ledde in

and the nobles of them perisshed for hunger / 
and the moultytude of them dryed

they whiche are as chefe of Christes relygyon / 
in the same captyuyte perysshe for
hunger / and wydder away for thurst. why
perysshe they for hunger? Bycause they
haue not lerned of Christ to breake barly
loues / they only lycke rounde aboute the
rough &amp; sharpe codde or huske / they sucke
out no mary or swete lycoure. And whye
wydder they so awaye for thurst? for bycause
they haue not lerned of Moyses to

               ANd for as moche as in sodayn writyng / 
one thyng calleth another to
remēbraunce / I wyll now adde the syxth
rule / whiche is in a maner of kynrede to
them that go before: a rule for all men as
necessary vnto helthe as it is of fewe regarded.

That rule is thus / that the mynde
of hym whiche enforseth and laboureth
to Christ wardeThou must vary from the cōmen people / vary as moche as is possyble
bothe from the dedes and also opynyons
of the comen ley people / and that
thensample of pyte be not fet of any other
saue of Christe onely:The ensample of pyte. for he is the onely
chefe patron / the only and chefe ensample
or fourme of lyuyng / from whom who so
euer wrieth one ynche or nayle brede / goth
besydes the ryght pathe and rometh out
of the way. wherfore Plato with grauyte
veryly as he dothe many thynges in his
bokes of the gouernaunce of a cyte or comen
welthe / denyeth any man to be able
to defende vertue constantly whiche hath
not instructed his mynde with sure &amp; vndouted
opinyons of filthynesse and of honesty.
But howe moche more peryllous is
it if false opinyons of the thynges whiche
pertayne to helthe shulde synke in to the
depe botome of thy mynde. For that consyderacion
therfore he thynketh that this
thyng shulde be cared for and loked vpon
chefely / that the gouernours them selfe
whome it behoueth to lacke all maner of
vnclenlynesse / graue in their owne myndes
very good opinyons of thynges to be
ensued &amp; eschewed / that is to say of good
and yuell / of vyces and of vertues / and

that they haue thē very assured / all doute
layde aparte as certayne lawes very holy
and goodly: for what so euer thynge clea
                  
                     •
                  eth
in the mynde surely roted with stedfaste
byleue / that euery man declareth in
his maners and conuersacyon. Therfore
the chefe care of christen men ought to be
applyed to this poynteThe bringyng vp of chrysten mens chyldren / that their children
streyght waye from the cradle / amongest
the very flatterynges of the norises / whyles
the father and mother kysse thē / maye
receyue and sucke vnder the handes of
them whiche are lerned / opynyons and
perswasyons mete and worthy of Christ:
bycause that nothynge eyther synketh deper
or cleaueth faster in the mynde than
that whiche (as Fabyus saythe) in the
yonge and tendre yeres is poured in. Let
be a farre of from y• eares of lytle bodyes
wanton songes of loue / whiche christen
men synge at whom &amp; where soeuer they
ryde or go / moche more fylthy than euer
the comen people of y• hethen men wolde
suffre to be had in vse. Let them not here
their mother wayle &amp; wring her handꝭ for
a lytle losse of worldly goodes / nor for the
losse of her suster let thē here her crye out
alas that euer she was borne / seyng that
she is but a wretche a woman loste or cast
awaye / lefte alone desolate and destytute.

Let not them here their father rebukynge
and vpbraydyng hym of cowarnesse whiche
hath not recōpensed iniury or wronge
with double: neyther yet laudynge them
whiche haue gathered togyder great habundaūce
of worldly substaunce / by what
soeuer maner it were. The disposycion of
man is frayle and prone to vyces / he catcheth
mischeuous ensample at ones: none
otherwyse than thou catchest fyre if it be
put to. Howe be it this selfe same thynge
is to be done in euery age / that all the errours
of the ley people myght be plucked
out agayne from the mynde by the harde
rootes / and in their places myght be planted
holsome opinyons / and so myght be
roborate yt with no vyolence they coulde
be shakē or plucked a sondre / which thing
who soeuer hath done shall easely &amp; without
besynesse by his owne accorde folowe
vertueUertue is the knowlege of thynges to be auoyded and of thinges to be desyred and loued. / and shall accompte them that do
otherwyse worthy to be lamented and pityed / 
&amp; not to be counterfayte or folowed.
Unto this thyng pertayneth that not vndiscrete
sayeng of Socrates (thoughe it
were rebuked of Arystotle) that vertue
was nothynge els but the knowlege of
thinges to be ensued and folowed / and of
thynges to be eschewed or fledde: not but
that Socrates sawe y• difference bytwene

knowlege of honesty and the loue of the
same. But as Demosthenes answered pronuncy

                  ion to be the first / the seconde / and
also the thyrde poynte of eloquēce / signyfyeng
that to be y• chefe parte / in so moche
that he thought eloquence to rest al togyther
in that thynge onely. In lykewyse
Socrates disputyng with Prothagoras / 
proueth by argumentes knowlege in all
vertue to beare suche roume / that vyces
can no other whence procede than of false
opinyons.Synne spryngeth of false opynyons. For certaynly brother bothe he
that loueth Christe / &amp; he also that loueth
voluptuousnesse / many false honour doth
folowe that thyng whiche is to eyther of
them swere / good / and beautyfull / but the
one slydeth through ignoraunce / in stede
of a swete thyng enbrasyng a thynge out
of measure sowre / flyeng as a sowre thing
that which is swetest of all: also folowing
that thyng for good and for lucre whiche
is naught els but domage and losse / and
fearynge that thynge for losse / whiche is
chefe gaynes or aduaūtage: and iudgyng
that thynge to be fayre whiche is foule / 
and wenyng or trowyng that to be shamfull
whiche onely is glorious and praysefull.
In conclusyon if a man were surely
and inwardly brought in byleue / and if
also it were dygested in to the substaunce

of his mynde as meate in to the substaūce
of the body / that onely vertue were best / 
most swete / most fayre / moste honest / most
profytable. And on the other syde fylthynesse
only to be an yuell thyng / a paynfull
tourment or punysshment / a foule thyng / 
shamfull / full of domage or losse: and dyd
measure these thyngꝭ not by the opinyon
of the comen people / but by the very nature
of the thynges / it coulde not be (suche
perswasyon or byleue endurynge) that he
shulde stycke faste and cleaue longe tyme
in yuell thynges. For nowe longe ago the
comen people is founde to be the moste

caue of Plato bounde with the bondes
of their owne affectyons / wonder at the
vayne ymages and shadowes of thynges
in stede of very true thynges / they be the
comen people. Shulde he not do preposterously
or out of ordre if a man wolde
go aboute to trye not the stone by the ruler
or squyre / but the ruler by the stone?
And were it not moche more vnreasonable
if a man wolde go about to bowe and
tourne / not the maners of men to Christ / 
but Christ to the lyuyng of men. Thynke
it not therfore well or aright bycause that

do it / but this wyse onely shall it be well
and ryght what so euer is done / if it agre

semeth this man to hate or to loue?
Certaynely there is no hate more cruell

are chaunged. who soeuer loue hym selfe

who soeuer be yuell mercyfull towarde
hym selfe is a tyrant moste cruell. To care
well is not to regarde. To hurte well is
to do good. To distroye well is to saue.
Thou shalte care well for thy selfe if thou
shalte dispyse the desyres of the flesshe / 

if in good maner thou shalt rage agaynst

whom hym lyst: though it be a very odyous
power to be able to hurte / for in that

selfe / yt is to wete in doyng harme. Onely
god is myghty in dede / whiche neyther
can hurte if he wolde / neyther yet wolde
if he coulde / for his nature is to do good.
But this myghty felowe howe dothe he
I beseche the hurte a man? He shall take
away thy money? he shal beate thy body?
he shall robbe the of thy lyfe? If he do it
to hym that serueth god well / he hath
done a good dede in stede of an yuell: but
and if he haue done it to an yuell man / the
one hath mynystred an occasyon veryly / 
but the other hath hurte hym selfe: for no
man is hurte but of hym selfe. No man
gothe aboute to hurte another except the
same man hathe moche more greuously

hurte hym selfe aforehande. Thou enforsest
to hurte me in my money or goodes.
Nowe hast thou through the losse of charyte
hurte thy selfe most greuously. Thou
canste nat fasten a wounde in me / but if
thou haue receyued a woūde moche more

slayn thyne own soule before. But Paule
whiche to doo wronge was a man very

                  LEt this excellent lernyng and paradoxes
of the true chrysten fayth be
sure and stedfast with the / that no christen
man may thynke that he is borne for him
selfe: neyther ought to haue the mynde to
lyue to himselfe: but what so euer he hath
what so euer he is / that all togyther lette
hym ascribe not to hym self / but vnto god
the authour therof / &amp; of whome it came / 
all his goodes let hym thynke to be commune
to all men.A chrysten mā is not borne for hym selfe eyther to folowe his owne pleasure. The charite of a christen
man knoweth no properte: let hym loue
good men in Chryst / euyll men for Chrystes
sake / whiche so loued vs fyrst whan
we were yet his ennemyes / that he bestowed
hymselfe on vs all togyder for our redempcyon:
let hym enbrace the one bycause
they be good: the other neuertheles
to make them good: he shall hate no man
at all / no more veryly than a faithful phisicyan
hateth a sycke man: let hym be an
ennemy onely vnto vices: the greater the
disease is / the greater cure wyll pure charite
put therto: he is an adulter / he hath
cōmytted sacrilege / he is a turke: let a christen
man desye the adulter / not the man:
let hym despyse the cōmytter of sacrilege / 
not the man:we must desye 
                        •
                      abhorre the vices / but not the man. let hym kyll the turlie / not
the man: let hym fynde the meanes that
the euyll man perysshe suche as he hathe

made hym selfe to be / but let the man be
saued whom god made: let hym wyll well
wysshe well / and do well to all men vnfaynedly:
neyther hurte them whiche haue
deserued it / but do good to them whiche
haue not deserued it: let hym be glad
of all mens cōmodytees as well as of his
owne / &amp; also be sory for all mens harmes
none otherwyse than for his owne. For
veryly this is that whiche thapostle commaūdeth:
to wepe with them that wepe / 
to ioye with them that ioyen / yea let hym
rather take an other mans harme greuouser
thā his owne: &amp; of his brothers welthe
be gladder than of his owne. It is not a
christe mans parte to thynke on this wise
what haue I to do with this felowe / I
knowe not whether he be blacke or white
he is vnknowen to me / he is a straūger to
me / he neuer dyd ought for me / he hathe
hurt me somtyme / but dyd me neuer good
Thynke none of these thinges: remembre
onely for what beseruyng can those thynges
whiche Chryst hath done / for y• which
wolde his kyndnes done to the / sholde be
recompensed / not in hym selfe / but in thy
neyghbour. Onely se of what thynges he
hath nede / &amp; what thou art able to do for
hym. Thynke this thynge onely / he is my
brother in our lorde coheyre in Chryste / a

membre of the same body / redemed with
one blode / a felowe in y• cōmune fayth / called
vnto y• very same grace &amp; felicite of the
lyfe to cōme / euen as the apostle sayd one
body and one spiryt as ye be called in one
hope of your callyng one lorde &amp; one faith
one baptisme / one god / &amp; father of al whiche
is aboue all &amp; euerywhere / &amp; in all vs / 
how can he be a straūger to whome thou
art coupled with so many folde bondes of
vnite? Among the gentyles let those circū
                  staunces
of rethoricyens be of no lytel valure
&amp; weyght / eyther vnto beniuolence or
vnto maliuolēce / he is a citezī of y• same cite / 
he is of aliaūce / he is my cosin / he is my
familiar frende / he is my fathers frende / he
hath wel deserued / he is kynde / borne of an
honest stock / riche or otherwise. In Christ
all these thynges eyther be nothyng / or after
the mynde of Paule be al one / &amp; the very
selfe same thynge: let this be euer p̄sent
before thyne eyes / &amp; let this suffyse the / he
is my flesshe / he is my brother in Chryste.

the heed of Christ is god. It is done to the

spronge / that is to wyte / frō ye heed.Let euery mā bestowe in comen what soeuer he receyued of god. This
veryly is the thynge whiche Paule wryteth
to the Corynthes / saying. As y• body
is one &amp; hath many mēbres / &amp; all the membres
of the body though they be many / yet
be they but one body. Euen so lykewise is

Chryst / for in one spiryt we be all baptised
to make one body / whether we be iewes
or gentyles / whether we be bonde or free / 
and all we haue dronke of one spiryte (for
the body sayth Paule) is not one membre
but many: yf the fote shall say / I am not y•
hand / I am not of the body: is he therfore
not of the body? yf the eare shall say / I am
not the eye / I am not of ye body: is he therfore
not of the body? yf all the body sholde
be the eye / where is than the hearynge: yf
all the body were y• hearyng / where than
shold be the smellyng. But now god hath
put the membres euery one of them in the
body / as it pleased hym: for yf all were but
one mēbre / where were y• body: but now
veryly ben there many membres / yet but
one body. The eye can not say to the hand
I haue no nede of thy helpe / or agayn the
heed to the fete / ye be not to me necessary:
but those mēbres of the body whiche seme
to be y• weyker are moche more necessary:
&amp; to those whiche we thynke to be the viler
membres of the body we gyue more haboundaunt
honour: &amp; those whiche be our
vnhonest mēbres haue more haboūdaunt
honesty / for our honest mēbres haue nede
of nothyng. But god hath tempered &amp; ordred
the body / gyuyng plenteous honour
to that parte whiche lacked / bicause there

shold be no diuision / debate or stryfe in the
body / but that the mēbres sholde care one
for an other indifferently. But it is ye whiche
are the body of Chryst &amp; membres one
dependynge of an other. He wryteth lyke
thyngꝭ to the Romayns / saying in one body
we haue many membres / &amp; all mēbres

Thou sayst I wolde haue reproued hī

Than to conclude / thou hast nothynge

thou not how he sayd that ye may be the
sones of your father: yf thou care not to be
the sone of god / that lawe ꝑteineth not to

why they also cast not in our tethes

vs with the sarazyns the name of Chryst

For what so euer there is anywhere of

The hyghest honourehonour is the rewarde of vertue / and not of ryches. that can be / is to
