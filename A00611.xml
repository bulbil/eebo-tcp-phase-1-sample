            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

               HAuing (Right Honourable) long time purpoſed, to put ſomewhat in practize that I might preſent to your honourable viewe, the weakneſſe of my abilitie hath hitherto holden mee in doubt, whither I were beſt, by writing to ſhew my good wil, or by ſtaying my penne to conceale the ſame. But being at Sea in March laſt in the Hercules of London, I reſolued to take in hand the tranſlating of this little worke out of Italian into Engliſhe, aſwell in regarde of the newneſſe therof, being neuer printed before that time: as alſo for the rareneſſe of the ſubiect and matter it treateth off, and the commoditie thar Merchants and other my Cuntrimen may reape by it. And hauing finiſhed the ſame, preſuming more vpon your honourable curteſie, then vpon the worthineſſe of ſo ſmall a woorke, and hoping of your honourable fauour for

the defence therof, I am bolde in all humble and dutifull ſort to preſent the ſame to your honourable viewe and protection, not as a thing worthy the patronage of ſo honorable a perſonage as your honour is, but as a token of my dutifull affection and bounden duty to your Lordſhip: beſeechiug you therfore to vouchſafe of the ſame with ſo good a will as I preſent it vnto you. And ſo moſt humbly I take my leaue, beſeeching the almightie to bleſſe and proſper you in all your honourable enterpriſes, to the good liking of her Maieſty, and profite of the Commonweale.
            
               Your Honours moſt humble and ready at commaund, Thomas Hickock.
            
         
         
            
            Caeſar Frederick to the Reader.
            
               I Hauing (Gentle Reader) for the ſpace of eighteene yeeres continually coaſted &amp; trauailed as it were, all the Eaſt Indies, and many other countreyes beyonde the Indies, wherein I haue had both good and yll ſucceſſe, in my trauells: I haue ſeen &amp; vnderſtood many things worthy the noting, and to bee knowne to all the world: the which were neuer as yet written of any, I thought it good (ſeeing the almightie had giuen mee grace, after ſo long perilles in pasſing ſuch a long voyage,) to returne into my owne Country, the noble Citie of 
                  Ʋenice, I ſay, I thought it good, as breefely as I could, to write and ſet foorth this voiage made by mee, with the meruellous things I haue ſeene in my trauels in the Indies. The mightie Princes that gouern thoſe Cuntreys, Their Religion, and faith that they haue, the rytes and cuſtomes which they vſe, and liue by, of the diuers ſucceſſe that hapned vnto me, and howe many of theſe conntreys are a bounding with ſpices, drugs, and Iewels, giuing alſo profitable aduertiſement, to all thoſe that haue a deſire to make ſuch a voyage. And becauſe that the whole world may more commodiouſly reioice at this my trauell: I haue cauſed it to bee printed in this order, and nowe I preſent it vnto you (Gentle and Jouing Readers). to whome for the varieties of thinges herein conteined, I hope that it ſhall bee with great delight receiued, and thus God of his goodneſſe keepe you.

                  BEing at Sea (Gentle and friendly Reader) in this my laſt voyage to Tripoly, in Anno. 1587. This little Booke of M. Caeſar Fredericks (Merchant of Venice) comming into my handes: which when I had read it ouer, I was deſirous to tranſlate the ſame out of Italian into our vulgar tongue. In which Booke (Gentle Reader) thou muſt not looke for a garden of ſweete Engliſh Roſes, (meaning pleaſant Engliſh termes,) but thou ſhalt finde bancks full of Sauory, for I haue not beene a Scholler (brought vp to write fine Schoole-termes,) but haue ſimplie folowed the Authors ſence in that phraze of ſpeech that we commonly vſe: In which Booke, (if thou readeſt it through), thou ſhalt find good ſauour to thy ſelfe, and profite to thy Countrie. And as the author was in traualing theſe Countries eighteene yeres, and got great benefite in them with a ſmall ſtocke: ſo mayeſt thou if thou wilt trauell thoſe Countries, and get great gaine as he did. For why? the way is layde open before thee, and as thou readeſt, conſider with thy ſelfe, that he which looketh on a Iewell, perceiueth not at once all the faultes in it: but when many eyes haue the ſame, ſome findeth one fault, and ſome another, ſo that the blemiſhes cannot be hid. So (Gentle Reader) thou mayeſt ſee that in this worke which I coulde not ſee: wherein, if thou finde a blemiſh in this my ſimple worke, I pray thee hartily couer the ſame with the ſhadowe of Patience, or elſe friendly correct the ſame: and not raſhly to iudge or contemne the paines of a willing minde, ſo ſhall I be encouraged to take the like paines in annother. Thus I refer to the Epiſtle of the author, wherein thou ſhalt vnderſtande the effect of this booke, and all the trauails that he tooke in thoſe Countries: read (I ſay) &amp; then iudge of the matter, according to thy good diſcretion. Thus I leaue thee to the tuition of the almighty: who euer keepe thee in health, and giue thee in the Lorde thy owne hearts deſire.

            ¶ A voyage to the Eaſt Indies, and beyond the Indies. &amp;c.
            IN the yeere of our Lorde God. 1563. I Caeſar Frederick, being in Venice, and very deſirous to ſée the Eaſte partes of the worlde, I Shipped my ſelfe in a ſhippe called the Gradaige
               The Authors going from Venice to Cipris and Tripolye. of Venice with certaine merchandiſe, gouerned by M. Iacamo Vatica, which was bound to Cypris with his ſhip, with whome I went, and when wee were ariued in Cipris, I left that ſhip and went in a leſſer to Tripoly in Soria, where I ſtayde a while. Afterward I I tooke my iourney to Alexo, &amp; there I acquainted my ſelfe with merchantes of Armenia and Moores: that were Merchants, and conſorted to go with them to Ornus, and we departed from Alepo, and in two dayes iourny and a halfe, we came to a Citie called Bir.
            
            
               Of the Citie of BIR.
               
                  BIR is a ſmall citie verie ſcarce of all maner of victuals, and neere vnto the walls of the city runneth the riuer of Euphrates, in this citie the merchants deuide themſelues into companies, according to their merchandice y• theyThe Riuer Euphrates. haue, &amp; there either they buy or make a boat to carie them &amp; their goods to Babylon, downe the riuer Euphrates, with charge of a merchant and mariners to conduct the boat in the voiage: theſe boats are in a manner flat bottomed, yet they be verie ſtrong: and for all that they are ſo ſtrong, they wil ſerue but for one voiage. They are made according to the ſholdnes of the riuer, becauſe that the riuer is in many places ful of great ſtones, which doth greatly hinder and trouble thoſe that go down the riuer. Theſe boats ſerue but for one voiage downe the riuer vnto a village called Feluchia,
                  Feluchia a ſmall Citie in Euphrates. becauſe it is impoſſible to bring them vp the riuer backe againe. At Feluchia the merchants plucke their boates

in peeces, or elſe ſell them for a ſmall price, For that at Bir they coſt the merchants forty or fiftie chickens apeece, and they ſell them at Feluchia for 7 or 8 chickens a peece, becauſe that when the merchants return from Babylon backe again if they haue merchandice or goods that oweth cuſtome: then they make their returne in fortie dayes through the wilderneſſe, paſſing that way with a great deale leſſer charges then the other way. And if they haue not merchandiſe thatMoſule. oweth cuſtome, then they goe by the way of Moſule, where it coſteth them great charges both the Carauan and companie, from Bir where the merchantes imbarke them ſelues to Feluchia ouer againſt Babylon, if the riuer haue good ſtore of Water, they ſhall make their voiage in fifteene or eightéene daies downe the Riuer, and if the Water be lowe, and it haue not rained, then it is much trouble, and it will bee fortie or fiftie dayes iourny downe, becauſe that when the barkes ſtrike on the ſtones that be in the Riuer, then they muſt vnlade them, which is great trouble, and then lade them againe, when they haue mended their boat: therefore it is not neceſſarie, neither doe the merchants goe with one boate alone, but two or three, that if one boate ſplit and bee loſt with ſtriking on the ſholdes, they may haue another redy to take in their goods, vntil ſuch time as they haue mē
                  ded the broken boate, and if they drawe the broken boate a land to mend her, it is harde to defend her in the night, from the great multitude of Arabians yt wil come downe there to rob you &amp; in the riuers euery night, whē you make faſt your boat to the banckſide, you muſt kéepe good watch againſt theThe Arabian theeues are in number like to Antes. Arabians which are theeues in number like to ants, yet whē, they come to rob, they wil not kil, but ſteal &amp; run away, hargubuſhes is a very good weapen againſt thē, for y• they ſtand greatly in feare of the ſhot, &amp; as you paſſe the riuer Euphrates, from Bir to Feluchia there is certaine places which you muſt paſſe by, where you pay cuſtome certain madines vpon a bale, which cuſtom is belonging to the ſon of Aboriſe king of the Arabians and deſart, and hath certain Cities and villages, on the riuer Euphrates.
               
            
            
               
               Feluchia and Babilon.
               FEluchia is a village where they that come from Bir do vnbarke themſelues and vnlade their goods, and it is diſtant from Babilon a daies iorney &amp; a halfe by land: Babilon is no great Cittie, but it is very populous, andThe old Babylon hath great trade with Merchants ſtill. of great trade of Strangers becauſe it is a great through fare, for Perſia, Turkia, and Arabia: and verye oftentimes there goeth out frō thence Carauans into diuers countries: and the citie is verye copious of victuals, which cometh out of Armenia downe the riuer of Tigris, on certaine Zattares or Raffes made of blowne hides or ſkins called Vtrij.
                  Raffes made of blowen hides, to carie victuals to Babilon. This riuer Tigris dooth waſh the walles of the citie, theſe Raffes are bound faſt together, and then they lay boards on the aforeſaid blowne ſkins, and on the boards they lade the commodities, &amp; ſo come they to Babilon where they vnladeA prettie deuice. thē, &amp; being vnladen, they let out the winde out of the ſkins, and lade them on Cammels to make another voyage. This Citie of Babilon is ſcituate in the kingdome of Perſia, but now gouerned by the Turkes: On the other ſide of the riuer towards Arabia, ouer againſt the citie, there is a faire place or towne, and in it a faire Bazarro for Merchants, with verie manie lodges, where the greateſt part of the Merchants Strangers which come to Babilon doolye with their merchandize. The paſſing ouer Tigris from Babilon to this BoroughA bridge made of boates. is ouer a long bridge made of boates chained together with great chaines: prouided, that when the riuer waxeth great with the aboundance of raine y• falleth, then they open the bridge in the middle, where the on halfe of the bridge falleth to the walles of Babilon, and the other to the brinkes of this borough, on the other ſide of the riuer: &amp; as long as the bridge is open, they paſſe y• riuer in ſmall boates, with great danger becauſe of the ſmalnes of the boates, and the ouer lading of them, that with the fiercenes of the ſtreame they be ouerthrowne, or els the ſtreame dooth carrie them awaie, ſo that by this meanes, many people are loſt and drowned: this waye by proofe I haue many times ſéene.
            
            
               
               Of the Tower of Babilon.
               THe Tower of Nembroth or Babel is ſcituate on y• ſideThe Tower of Babell of ancient memory. of Tigris that Arabia is, and in a very greate plaine diſtant from Babilon 7. or 8. miles: which town is ruinated on euery ſide, and with the falling of it there is made a great Mountaine: ſo that it hath no forme at all, yet there is a great parte of it ſtanding, which is compaſſed and almoſt couered with the aforſaid fallings: this Tower was builded and made of fower ſquare Brickes, which BrickesTheſe bricks be in thicknes 6 or 7, inches &amp; a foote and a halfe ſquare, ſeene by our owne countreymen whome I knowe. were made of earth, and dried in the Sun in maner &amp; forme following: firſt they laid a lay of Bricks, thē a Mat made of Canes, ſquare as the Bricks, and in ſtead of lime, they daubed it with earth: theſe Mattes of Canes are at this time ſo ſtrong, that it is a thing wonderfull to beholde, being of ſuch antiquitie as it is, I haue gone round about it, and haue not found any place where there hath bin any doore or entrance: it may be in my iudgement in circuit about a mile, and rather leſſe then more.
               This Tower in effect, is contrary to al other things whichA thing wonderfull, are ſeene a far off, for they ſéeme ſmall, and the more néere a man commeth to them the bigger they be: but this Tower a far off ſéemeth a very great thing, and the neerer you come to it the l
                     •
                  ſſer. My iudgment and reaſon of this is, that becauſe the Tower is ſet in a very great plaine, and hath nothinge more about to make any ſhow ſauing the ruines of it which it hath made round about, and for this reſpect that diſcrying it a far off, that peece of the Tower which yet ſtandeth with the mountaine that is made of the ſubſtance that hath fallen from it, maketh a greater ſhew then you ſhall finde comming neere to it.
            
            
               Babilon and Baſora.
               FRom Babilon I departed for Baſora, ſhipping my ſelfe in one of the barks that vſe to go in the riuer Tigris frō 
                  Babilon to Baſora, and from Baſora to Babilon: which

               Bezeneger.
               THe cittie of Bezeneger was ſacked in the yeare 1565, by 4 kinges of the Mores, which were of great power &amp; might, the names of theſe foure kings were theſe following. The firſt was called Dialcan, the ſecond Zamaluc, the third Cotamaluc, &amp; the fourth Viridy: and yet theſe foure kings were not able to ouercom this cittie &amp; theA moſt vnkind &amp; wicked treaſon againſt their prince: this they haue for giuing credit to ſtrrngers, rather then their owne natiue people. king of Bezeneger, but by treaſon. This king of Bezeneger was a Gentile, and hauing amongſt all other of his Captaines, two which were notable, and they were Mores, and theſe two Captaines had either of them in charge 70 or 80 thouſand men. Theſe two Captaines being of one Religion with the foure kings which were Mores, wrought meanes with them to betray their owne king into their hands. The king of Bezeneger eſtéemed not the force of the foure kings his enimies, but went out of his Citie to wage battell with them in the fields, which when the armies were ioined, the battell laſted but a while not the ſpace of foure houres, becauſe the two traytorous Captaines, in the chéefeſt of the fight, with their companies turne their faces againſt their king, and made ſuch diſorder in his armie, that as aſtonied they ſet themſelues to flight: thirtie yeares was this kingdome gouerned by thrée brethren which were tyrants, the which kéeping the rightfull king in priſon, it was their vſe euery yeare once, to ſhew him to the people, and they at their pleaſures ruled as they liſted. Theſe brethren were thrée Captaines belonging to the father of the king they kept in priſon, which when he died, left his ſonne verye yoong, and then they tooke the gouernment to themſelues: the chéefeſt of theſe thrée was called Ramaragio, and he ſat in the roiall throne, and was called king: the ſecond was called Temiragio, and he tooke the gouernement on him: the third was called Bengatre, and he was captaine generall of the armie. Theſe thrée brethren were in this battell, in the which the chéefeſt and the laſt were neuer heard of quicke nor dead.

Onely Temeragio fled in the battell, hauing loſt one of his eyes: when the newes came to the cittie of the ouerthrow in the battell, the wiues and children of theſe thrée tyrants, with their lawfull king (kept priſoner) fled away, ſpoiled asThe ſacking of the citie. they were, and the foure kings of the Mores entred the citie Bezeneger with great triumph, and there they remained ſirmoneths, ſearching vnder houſes and in all places for mony and other things that were hidden, and thē they departed to their owne kingdomes, becauſe they were not able to maintaine ſuch a kindome as that was, ſo far diſtant from their owne countrie.
               When the kings were departed from Bezeneger, this Temiragio returned to the Citie, and then began for to repopulate it, and ſent word to Goa to the Merchants, that if they had anye Horſſes to bring them to him, and he would pay well for them, and for this cauſe the aforeſaid two marchants that I went in company withall, carried thoſe Horſſes that they had to Bezeneger. Alſo this Tyrant made anAn excellent good pollici

Then he licenſed the Merchants to depart, without giuing them anye thing for theyr Horſſes, which when the poore men ſawe, they were deſperate, and as it were madde with ſorrowe and greefe.
               I reſted in Bezeneger ſeauen moneths, although in one moneth I might haue diſcharged all my buſineſſe, for it was neceſſary to reſt there vntil the waies were cléere of théeues which at that time ranged vp and downe: and in the time I reſted there, I ſawe manye ſtrange and beaſtlye déedes doone of the Gentiles.

                  Their winter is our ſūmer. for that winter: the winter in thoſe parts of the Indies beginneth the 15. of May, and laſteth vnto the end of October: &amp; as we were in Ancola, there came another Marchant of horſes in a planchine, and two portingale Souldiers which came from Zeland, and two carriers of letters, which were Chriſtians borne in the Indies: all theſe conſorted to go to Goa together, and I determined to go with them, and cauſed a pallanchine to be made for me very poorely of Canes: and in one of them Canes I hid priuily all the Jewels I had, and according to the order, I tooke eight Falchines to carrie me, and one daye about eluen of the clocke, we ſet forwards on our iourney, and about two of the clock in the afternoone, as we paſſed a mountaine which deuideth the territorie of Ancola and Dyalcan, I being a little behind my company, was aſſaulted of by eight théeues, foure of them had Swords and Targats, and the other foure had Bowes &amp; Arrowes, when the Falchines that carried me vnderſtood the noyſe of the aſſault, they let the palanchine &amp; me fall to the ground, &amp; ran away and left me alone, with my clothes wrapped about me: preſently the théeues were on my necke, and riſeling me, they ſtripped me ſtarke naked, and I fained my ſelfe ſicke, bicauſe I would not leaue the Palanchine, and I had made me a little bed of my clothes, the théeues ſought it very narowly and ſubtilly, and found two purſſes that I had, well bound vp together, wherein I had put my Copper mony which I had changed for foure pagodies in Ancola, the théeues thinking it had béene ſo manye Duckets of Golde, ſearched no further, then they threw all my clothes in a buſh and hied them away, and as God would haue it, at their departure, there fell from them a handkercher, and when I ſawe it, I roſe from my Palanchine or Couche, and tooke it vp, and wrapped it together within my Palanchine. Then theſe my Falchines were of ſo good condition, that they

returned to ſéeke me, whereas I thought I ſhould not haue found ſo much goodnes in them becauſe they were paid their money afore hand, as is the vſe: I had thought to haue ſeene them no more: before their comming I was determined to pluck the Cane wherin my Jewels were bidden, out of my cowtch and to haue made me a walking ſtaffe, to carry in my hand to Goa, thinking that I ſhould haue gone thether on foote, but by the faithfulneſſe of my Falchines, I was rid of that trouble, and ſo in fower dayes they carried me to Goa, in which time I made hard fare, for ye théeues left me neither money golde nor ſiluer, &amp; that which I did eat, was geuen me of my men for gods ſake: and after at my comming to Goa I payde them euery thing rially all that I had of them: from Goa I departed for Cochin, which is a voyage of 300. miles, and betwéene theſe two Cties are many holds of the Portingales, as Onor, Mangalor, Barzelor &amp; Cananor.

The kings children

The Pilot tolde vs that wee were by his altitude from a Citie called Tenaſſiry, a Citie in the kingdome of Pegu, and theſe his wordes were not true, but

Portugalles, and their houſes of wood and ſtrawe, in the which rumour there were ſome Portugalles wounded, and one of them ſlaine, and others without making proofe of there manhoode, which the daye before did ſo bragge at that time: put themſelues to flight moſte ſhamefullye, and ſaued them ſelues a boorde of little Shippes, that were at an ancker in the harbour, and ſome that were in their beddes fledde away naked, and that night they caried away all the Portugalles goodes, out of the ſuburbes into the Citie, and thoſe Portugalles that had their goodes in the ſuburbes with all. After this the Portugalles that were fled into the ſhippes to ſaue themſelues, tooke a newe courage to themſelues, and came a lande and ſet fire on the houſes in the ſuburbs, which houſes being made of boord and ſtraw, and a freſh winde: in ſmall time they were burnt and conſumed, with which fire halfe the Citie had like to beene burnt, when the Portugalles had done this, they were without all hope to recouer any part of their goodes againe, which goods might amount to the ſumme of ſixtéene thouſande duckets, which if they had not ſet fire to the towne, they might haue had their goodes giuen them gratis, then the Portugalles hauing vnderſtanding that this thing was not done by the conſent of the King, but by his lifetenant and the Retor of the citie, they were verie yll content, knowing that they had made a greate fault, yet the next morning following, the Portugalles began to batter and ſhoote their ordinance againſt the Citie, which batterie of theirs continued fowre dayes, but all was in vaine, for the ſhott neuer hit the Citie, but light on the top of a ſmall hill neere vnto it, ſo that the Citie had no harme, when the Retor perceiuing that the Portugalles made batry againſt the Citie, he tooke twentie and one Portugalles that were there in the Citie, and ſent them foure miles into the Countrie, there to tarrie vntill ſuch time as the other Portugalles were departed, that made the batterie, who after their departure let them go at their owne libertie without any harme done vnto them, I was alwayes in my houſe with a good guard appointed me

by the Retor, that no man ſhoulde doe mee iniurie, nor harme me nor my goodes, in ſuch wiſe that hee perfourmed all that hee had promiſed mee in the name of the King, but he would not let me depart before the comming of the king, which was my hindrance greatly, becauſe I was twentie and one moneths ſequeſted, that I coulde not buy nor ſell any kind of merchandire. Thoſe commodities that I brought thither, was Peper, Sandolo, and Procellan of China, ſo when the King was come home, I made my ſupplication vnto him, and I was licenſed to depart when I would.
               From Martauan I departed to goe to the chiefeſt Citie inPegu▪ is the name of the Kingdome and y• choice Citie is called after that name. the kingdome of Pegu, which is alſo called after the name of the Kingdome, which voyage is made by ſea in three or foure dayes, they may goe alſo by Land, but hee that hath merchandire it is better for him to goe by ſea and leſſer charge, and in this voyage you ſhal haue a Marcareo, which is one of the meruellous things in the world y• nature hath wrought, and I neuer ſawe anie thing ſo hard to be beléeued as this, The great encreaſing and deminiſhing that the Water maketh there at one puſhe or inſtant, and with the horribleA thing moſt meruailous that at the comming of the tide, that the earth ſhould quake earth quake and great noyſe that it maketh where it commeth. We departed from Martauan in barks, which are like to our Pylot boates, with the encreaſe of the Water, and they go as ſwift as an arrowe out of a bowe, ſo long as the tide runneth with them, and when the water is at the higheſt, then they drawe themſelues out of the Chanel towards ſome bancke, and there they come to anker, and when the Water is diminiſhed, then they reſt a drye: and when the barkes reſt drie, they are as high from the bottome of the Chanell, as any houſe toppe is high from the ground. They let their barks lie ſo high for this reſpect, that if there ſhould any ſhippe reſt or ride in the Chanell, with ſuch force commeth in the Water, that it would ouerthrowe ſhip or bark: yet for all this, that the barkes bee ſo farre out of the Chanell,This tide is like to the tides in our Riuer of Seuerne. and though the Water hath loſt her greateſt ſtrength and furie before it come ſo high, yet they make faſt their prowe to the ſtreme, and often times it maketh them verie

fearfull, &amp; if the Anker did not hold her prow vp by ſtrength: ſhe woulde bee ouerthrowne and loſt with men and goods, when the Water beginneth to encreaſe, it maketh ſuch a noiſe and ſo great that you would thinke it an earthquake, &amp; preſently at the firſt it maketh 3. wanes.

               There is in Pegu eight Brokers of the Kings, which areTareghe are names of the brookes. called Tareghe, who are bounde to ſell all the merchandize to come to Pegu, at the common or the corent price, then

if the merchants will ſell their goodes at that price: they ſell it away, and the Brokers haue two in y• hundreth of euerie ſort of Merchandiſe, and they are bounde to make good the debtes of that goodes, becauſe it is ſolde by their handes or meanes, and on their wordes, and oftentimes the merchantThe brokers are lowed to make good al the debts to the merchant. knoweth not to whome he giueth his goodes, yet hee cannot loſe any thing thereby, for that the broker is bounde in any wiſe to pay him, and if the merchant ſell his goodes without the conſent of the broker: yet neuertheleſſe he muſt pay him two percento, and be in daunger of his mony, but this is verie ſeldome ſeene, becauſe the Wife, Children, andA law for banckroutes. ſlaues of the debttor are bounde to the creditor, and when his time is expired and paiment not made, the creditor may take the debter and carie him home to his houſe, and ſhut him vp in a Magazen, whereby preſently he hath his monie, and not beeing able to pay the creditor, hee may take the wife, children, and ſlaues of the debtor, and ſell them, for ſo is the law of that kingdome. The corant mony that is in this citie, and throughout all this kingdome is called Ganſa or Ganza which is made of Copper and Leade: It is not the monie of the King, but euerie man may ſtampe it that will, becauſe it hath his iuſt partition or valure: but they make many of them falſe by putting ouermuch leade into them,Euery man may ſtampe what mony

For there is no other mony corant amongeſt them. And Golde, Siluer, and other Merchandiſe, is one time déerer then another, as all other things bee.
               This Ganza goeth by weight of Byze, and this name ofBuy Golde &amp; filuer with copper and leade. 
                  Byza goeth for the accounpt of the waight, and commonly a Byza of a Ganza is worth (after our account) halfe a ducket, little more or leſſe: and according as Golde and SiluerThe order of their monye. is more or leſſe in price, but the Byza neuer changeth, euerie Byza maketh a hundreth Ganza of waight, &amp; ſo the number of the mony is Byza.

Tome in their Shippes: it is as it were about the natiuitie, and when they haue cuſtomed their goods, then they muſt ſell it for credite, for a moneth or two: and then at the beginning of March the Shippes depart. The Merchants that come from S. Tome, take for the paiment of their goods, gold, and ſiluer, which is neuer wanting there. And 8. or 10. daiesGood inſtructions. before their departure, they are all ſatiſfied: alſo they may haue Rubies in paiment, but they make no account of them &amp; they that will winter there for another yéere, it is needefull that they be aduertized, that in the ſale of their goodes, that they ſperify in their bargain, the term of two or thrée mōths paiment, and y• their paiment ſhal be in ſo many Ganza, and neither golde nor ſiluer, becauſe that with the Ganza they may buy and ſell euerie thing with great aduantage. And howe néedefull it is to be aduertized, that when they will recouer their payments: in what order they ſhall receiue their Ganza, becauſe hee that is not practicke may doe him ſelfe great wrong in the waight of the Ganſa, as alſo in the falſeneſſe of them, in the waight hee may bee greatly deceiued, becauſe that from place to place, it doth riſe and fall greatly: and therefore when any man will receiue money or make paiment, hee muſt take a publique wayer of money: a day or two before hee goe about his buſineſſe, and giue him in payment for his labour, two Byza a moneth, and for this hee is bounde to make good all your mony heerby: and to maintaine it for good, for that hee receiueth it and ſeales the bagges with his Seale: and when hee hath receiued any ſtore, there hee cauſeth it to bee brought into the Magaſea of the Merchant, that is the owner of it.
               That mony is verie waightie, for forty Byza is a great Porters burden, and alſo where the Merchant hath any paymente to bee made for thoſe goodes, whiche hee buyeth: the Comon wayer of mony that receiueth his

So that by this means, the Merchant with the charges of two Byzes a moneth, receiueth and payeth out his monie without loſſe orThe merchandiſe that goe out of Pegu. trouble. Thoſe merchandiſe that goe out of the Pegu are theſe, as Gold, Siluer, Rubies, Saphyres, Spynelles, great ſtore of Beniamen, long Peper, Leade, Lacca, Ryce, Wine, ſome Sugar, yet there might be great ſtore of Sugar made in the Cuntry, for that they haue abundance of Canes, but they giue them to Eliphants to eat, and the people conſume great ſtore of them for foode, and many more doe they conſume in vaine things as theſe. In that Kingdome they ſpend many of theſe Sugar canes in making of houſes and tents which they call Varely for their Idoles, which they call Pagody, whereof there is great abundance, great &amp; ſmall, and theſe houſes are made in forme to little hilles, like to Sugar loaues or to Belles, and ſome of theſe houſes are as high as a reaſonable ſtéeple, at the foote they are verie large, that ſome of them bee in circuit a quarter of a mile, the ſaidIdoll houſes what faſhion they are of. houſes within are full of earth, and walled round about with brickes and dirt in ſtead of lyme, and without forme, from the top to the foot they make a couering for them with Sugar Canes, and plaiſtered with lyme all ouer, for otherwiſe they woulde be ſpoyled, by the great abundance of rain that falleth in thoſe Countreyes, alſo they conſume about theſe verely or Idoll houſes great ſtore of leaſe Golde, for that they ouerlay al the toppes of the houſes with gold, and ſome of them is couered with Golde from the toppe to theIdoll houſes couered with Golde. foote. In couering whereof there is great ſtore of Gold ſpent, for that euerie ten yeeres they new ouerlay them with gold, from the top to foote, ſo that with this vanitie they ſpende great aboundaunce of gold. For euerie ten yeeres the raine doth conſume the Golde from theſe houſes. And by this meanes they make Gold dearer in Pegu then it would bee, if they cōſumed not ſo much in this vanitie. Alſo it is a thing to be noted in the buying of Jewels in Pegu, for he that hath no knowledge ſhall haue as good Jewels, and as good cheap as he that hath beene practized there a long time, which is a

good order, which is this. There is in Pegu fowre men of good reputatiō, which are called Tareghe, or brokers of Jewels. Theſe fowre men haue all the Jewels, or Rubies in their handes, and the Merchant that will buy, commeth to one of theſe Tareghe and telleth him, that he hath ſo much money to imploy in Rubies. For through the handes of theſe fowre men paſſeth all the Rubies: for they haue ſuch quantity, that they knowe not what to doe with them, but ſell them at a moſte vile and baſe price. When the Merchant hath broke his minde to on of theſe Brokers or Tareghe, they carie him hōe to one of their Shops, although he haue no knowledge in Jewels: and when the Jewellers perceiue that hee will employ a good rounde ſumme, they will make bargaine, and if not, they let him alone. The vſe generally of this Citie, is this: y• when any Merchant hath brought any great quantity of Rubies, and haue agréed for them, the Merchant carieth them home to his houſe, let them bee of what valure they wil, he ſhall haue ſpace to looke on them and relooke them two or thrée dayes: and if hee haue no knowledge in them, he ſhal alwayes haue many Merchants in that City that hath very good knowledge in Jewels: with whome hee may alwayes conferre and take counſell with them, and ſhewe them vnto whome he will, and if he finde that hee hath not employed his money well, he may returne his Jewelles backe to them whome hee had them of, without any loſſe at all. Which thing is ſuch a ſhame to the Tereghe to haue his Jewels returne, that he had rather to beare a blowe on the face then that it ſhoulde be thought that he ſhoulde ſell them ſo deere to haue them returned. For theſe men haue alwayes great care that they make good employmentes, eſpecially to thoſe that haue no knowledge. This they doe, becauſe they woulde not looſe their credite: and when thoſe Merchantes that haue knowledge in Jewelles buy any, if they buy them déere it is there owne faults and not the Brokers: yet it is good to haue knowledge in Jewelles, by reaſon that he mayAn honeſt care of hea then people. ſomewhat eaſe the price. There is alſo a verie good order for which they haue in buying of Jewelles: which is this, there

is many merchants that ſtandeth by at the making of the bargaine, and becauſe they ſhall not vnderſtande howe theBargaines made with the nipping of Fingers vnder a cloth. Jewels be ſolde: The Broker and the Merchants haue their handes vnder a cloth, and by touching of fingers and nipping the ioynts they knowe what is done, what is bidden, and what is aſked. So that the ſtanders by know not what is demanded for them, although it be for a thouſand or ten thouſand Duckets. For euerie ioynt and euerie finger hath his ſignification. For if the Merchants that ſtand by, ſhould vnderſtand the bargain: it woulde breede great controuerſie amongeſt them, and at my beeinge in Pegu in the moneth of Auguſt, in Anno 69. and hauing gotten well by my endeuor, I was deſirous to ſée mine owne Countrie, and I thoughtThe Authors deſire to ſee his Cuntry. it good to goe by the way of Saint Tome, but then I ſhould tarrie vntill March.
               In which iourney I was councelled, yea, and fullie reſolued to goe by the way of Bangala, with a Shippe there ready to depart for that voyage. And when wee were departed from Pegu to Chitigan, a greate harbour or port, from whence there goeth ſmall Shippes to Cochin, before the fléete departe for Portugall, in which Shippes I was fully determined, to goe to Lyſhborn, &amp; ſo to Venice. When IThis Touffon is an extraordinary ſtorme at Sea. had thus reſouled my ſelfe, I went a boord of the Shippe of Bengala, at which time it was the yeere of Touffon, and to vnderſtand what this Touffon is: vnderſtand, that in the Indies often times, there is not ſtormes as is in other countries, but euerie ten or twelue yeeres, there is ſuch tempeſts and ſtormes, that it is a thing incredible, but to thoſe that haue ſéene it, neither doe they knowe certaine what yeere it will come.

In this yéere it was our chance to bee at Sea with the like ſtorme, but it happened well vnto vs, for that our Shippe was newly ouer-plancked, and had not any thing in her ſaue victuall and balaſtes, Siluer and Golde, whiche from Pegu they carrie to Bengala, and no other kinde of

And thus driuing two and fro as the winde and Sea woulde, wée were driuen in a darke night about fowre of the clocke and caſt on a Sholde, yet when it was day: we coulde neither ſée land on one ſide nor other, &amp; knew not where wee were.

The people are Moores, and the King a verie good man of a Moore king, for if he had béene a Tyrant as others bee, hee might haue robbed vs of all, becauſe the Portugall Captaine of Chitigan was in armes againſt the Retor of that place and euerie day there were ſome ſlaine, at which newes wee reſted there with no ſmall feare▪ kéeping good watch &amp; ward abroad euerie night as the vſe is, but the gouernour of the Towne did cōfort vs, and bad vs that we ſhould feare nothing, but that we ſhould repoſe our ſelues ſecurely without any danger, although the Portugalles of Chitigan had ſlaine the Gouernour of that Citie, and ſaide that wée were not culpable in that fact, and more he did vs euerie day what pleaſure he coulde, which was a thing contrarie to our iudgementes conſidering that they and the people of Chitigan were both ſubiectes to one King. We departed from Sondiua, and came to Chitigan the great port of Bengala, at the ſame time that the Portugalles had made peace and taken

a truce with the gouernours of the Towne, with this condition that the cheefe Captaine of the Portugalles with hisChitigan is a port in Bengala, where the Portingalles goe with their ſhips. Shippes ſhoulde depart without any lading, for there were then at that time eightéene Shippes of Portugalles great and ſmall. This Captaine being a Gentleman and of good courage: Yet for all this, he was contented to depart to his greate hindrance, rather then hee woulde ſéeke to hinder ſo manye of his freendes as were there, as alſo becauſe the time of the yéere was ſpent to goe to the Indies. The night before he departed, euerie Shippe that had any lading in them put it a boorde of the Captaine to helpe to eaſe his charge and to recompence his courteſies. In this time thereThe King of Rachim neighbour to Bengala. came a Meſſenger from the King of Rachim to this Portugall Captaine, who ſaide in the behalfe of his King, that hée had heard of the courage and valure of him, deſiring him gentlie that he woulde vouchſafe to come with this Shippe into his port, and comming thither hee ſhoulde bee verie well entreated.

From ye great port of Chitigan they carie for the Indies great ſtore of ryce, verie great quantitie of Bombaſt cloth of euerie ſorte, Sugar, Corne and Money, with other merchandiſe. And by reaſon that Warres was in Chitigan, the Portugall Shippes tarried there ſo late, that they ariued not at Cochin to ſoone as they were wont to doe other yeares.

For all this: I imbarked my ſelfe in a Gallie, that wente for Goa, and there to Ship my ſelfe for Ormus, but when we came to Goa, the viceroy woulde not ſuffer any Portugall to depart, by reaſon of the Warres. And beeing in Goa but a ſmall time, I fell ſicke of an infirmitie that helde mee fowre moneths: which with Phiſicke and diet coſt mée eight hundreth Duckets, and there I was conſtrayned to ſell a ſmall quantitie of Rubies to ſuſtaine my néed, and I ſolde that for fiue hundreth Duckets, that was worth a thouſande, and when I began to waxe well of my diſeaze: I had but litle of that monie left, euerie thing was ſo ſcarſe.

And for this cauſe, for that at my departure from Pegu, Opium wasOpiū a good Commoditye in Pegu. in great requeſt, then I went to Cambaya to imploy a good rounde ſumme of money in Opium, and there I bought ſixtie percells of Opyum, which coſt me two thouſand and a hundreth Duckets, euerie Ducket at fowre ſhillings two pence, and more I bought three bales of Bombaſt cloth,

which coſt mee eight hundred Ducketts, which was a good commoditie for Pegu: when I had boughte theſe thinges: the viceroy commanded that the cuſtom of the opium ſhould be paid in Goa, and paying cuſtom there they might carie it whether they would. I ſhipped my 3 bales of cloth at Chiale in a ſhip that we wente for Cochin, and I wente to Goa to pay to the aforeſaid cuſtome for my Opium, and from Goa I departed to Cochin in a ſhip that was for the voyage of Pegu, and went to winter then at S.

                  tes, and with great diligence we hardly ſaued her wt great loſſes to the captaine of the Ship, becauſe hee was forced to fraight another Ship in S. Tomes from Pegu with great loſſes &amp; intereſt, &amp; I with my frends agréed together in Manar to take a bark to cary vs to S. Tomes, which thing, we did wt al the reſt of the merchants, &amp; ariuing at S. Tomes I had news through or by the way of Bengala y• in Pegu: Opium was verie dear, &amp; I knew that in S. Tome there was no Opium but mine to go from Pegu that yeere, ſo that I was holden of all the Merchantes there: to be verie rich, and ſo it would approued, if my aduerſe fortunes had not beene contrarie to my hope, which was this. At that time there went a great ſhippeA reconing before the hoſte. from Cambaya, to the King of Aſſi, with great quantitie of Opium, and there to lade Peper: in which voyage there came ſuch a ſtorme, that the ſhip was forced with wether to go romor 800 miles, &amp; by this means came to Pegu, Wheras they

ariued a day before me, ſo that Opion which was before verie deare was now at a baſe price: ſo that which was ſolde for fiftie Bize before, was ſolde for two Bizze and halfe, there was ſuch quantitie came in that Ship, ſo that I was gladde to ſtay two yeeres in Pegu vnleſſe I would haue giuen away my commoditie: and at the ende of two yéeres I made of my 2100 Duckets which I beſtowed in Cambaya, I made but a thouſand Duckets. Then I departed againe from Pegu to goe for the Indies and for Ormus with greate quantitie of Lacca, and from Ormus I returned into the Indies for Chiall, and from Chiall to Cochin, and from Cochin to Pegu, Once more I loſt occaſion to make mee ritch, for wheras I might haue brought good ſtore of Opion again I brought but a little, being fearefull of my other voyage before, In this ſmall quantitie I made good profite. And nowe againe I determined to goe from my Countrey, and departing from Pegu, I tarried and wintered in Cochin, and then I left the Indies and came for Ormus.
               
               I thinke it verie neceſſarie before I ende my voyage, to reaſon ſomewhat, and to ſhew what fruits the Indies doth yéelde and bring foorth. Firſt, in the Indies and other Eaſt partes of India, there is Peper and Ginger, which groweth in all partes of India. And in ſome partes of the Indies, thePepper tree. greateſt quantities of Peper groweth in amongſt wilde buſhes, without any manner of labour: ſauing, that when it is ripe▪ they goe and gather it. The trée that the Peper groweth on, is like to our Juie, which runneth vp to the toppes of trees whereſoeur, and if it ſhould not take hold of ſome tree, it would ly flat and rotte on the grounde. This Peper trée hath his flower and berry, like in all partes to our Juie berry, and thoſe berryes be graynes in Peper: ſo that when they gather them they bee gréene, and then they lay them in the Sunne, and they become blacke.
