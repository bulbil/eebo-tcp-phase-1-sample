            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                  MAn beinge allianced, both with Heaven, and earthe, is throughe his corporall neceſſityes conſtrayned, to conterate, and ſpende the beſt time of his Life, in Sleepe, &amp; repoſe: notvvithſtanding being reſuſcitated, &amp; erected out of a profounde, &amp; deepe ſomniation, through the beſt parte of himſelfe, vvhich is his Soule, he purſueth, only and favoureth verye ſoberlye, the moſt vile and abiecte thinges, the concupiſcence, and apetite vvherof, he communicateth, and participate the, vvith brute, and irrationalle beaſtes. For man is not only this maſke or vizard, and this figurated and articulated Maſſa in certayne members, vvhich vvith our eyes vve diſcover and behoulde, &amp; vvith our fingers vve may touche and ſenſiblye feele: but is rather, the virtue, and internalle for me, vvhich effectuateth life in him, vigor, agilitye, and temperature, the ſame beinge as it vveare, a radiant beame a little ſparckle, and parcell, of the Divinitye, tranſmitted, and deſcended out of the moſt gloriouſe Empire of Heaven, to effectuate, and bringe to paſſe in this vvretched vvorlde, in our bodye, a ſhorte, and breefe ligatione: For vvho is there vvhich doubteth, that the Soule, remembringe, and callinge to minde her firſt originalle, vvoulde not addreſſe, and endevoure her ſelfe to lerne, yea and if it vveare poſſible to relerne, all thoſe thinges, vvhich be honorable vnto her Creator, &amp; might alſo be profitable to all other creatures? &amp; for this cauſe it is, vvhye vve have not our countenances declined tovvardes the earth as the brute beaſtes, but have them elevated tovvardes Heaven, becauſe through ſuch contemplacione, and by readinge of the true booke of lyfe, vve might dravve therout, and practice on the ordre, and imitate, the conſtance vvhich the caeleſtiall corps, doe obſerve, and one their perpetualle, and profitable agitatione therof.

It vveare alſo indeede great ſhame, perfidiouſnes, and execrable diſloyaltye, and treaſon for vs, vvhom God hath adorned vvith ſo livelye, vigorouſe, and fruictfull a ſpirite, that as all thinges vvhich are inanimate, doc travayle, and laboure for our proffite, vve ſhoulde ſhevve our ſelves ſtupidouſe, and involuntary to helpe the one the other in all thinges poſſible and advaunce them: for as the vviſe, and ſage men heertofore have ſayed, that even as all the mundayne, and terreſtrialle thinges, are created for man, and his vſe, in like ſorte alſo are men created for God, and the one man for the other. This conſideratiō moſt illuſtriouſe, &amp; mightye Kinge, hath vrged, and impelled me, after that I next vnto your maieſtye, have diſcharged my duty, and function, vvhich I vvas ovvinge vnto your Highnes, and that eſpeciallye in curinge of my Lorde, the Earle, of Montpenſier and my Lordes of Buhy, &amp; of Montigny, to peruſe, &amp; revolve certayne reſcriptiones, and memorialles, vvhich I had compiled, and collected together, vvhē I ſerved the diſceaſed Kinge, as vvell touchinge the manuall operations, as alſo the compariſone, and conference of the aunciente inſtruments of Chyrurgerye, vvith the nue inventede, becauſe through the diſcourſe &amp; rehearſall of the ſame, and by the diſcriptione and defiguratione of the foreſayed inſtrumentes, to demonſtrate, vvhat commodity vve might hope, and reape out of the one more then out of the other: All vvhich, havinge accordinge to mye poſſibillirye, &amp; as much as this pitifull time vvoulde permit &amp; allovve of finiſhed, I have embouldened myſelfe, to conſecrate, and dedicate the ſame vnto your moſt renoumned Maieſtye: vvhom ſupliantlye &amp; vvith all humillity I deſire, requeſte, and intreate, benignly to receave it, as a gifte, or preſent, vvhich is not diſagreeing vnto the preſent time, nether vvill be diſcommodiouſe to your highnes.

               THere is a common ſaying, &amp; is novv taken for a common proverbe: that all thinges have theire time, theire place, and theire ſayſon: by vvhich occaſion divers, &amp; ſundry interpriſes, vvhich indeede of themſelves are goode, doe leeſe their grace, and decorum, onlye becauſe in theire condecent time they vveare not practiſed, &amp; put in vre. But it is not ſoe vvith the vtilitye, vvhich the common vvealth expecteth, throughe our induſtrye, principallye, &amp; eſpeciallye, through the ſtudyes of good artes: ſuch fruictes are never importune, nether at anye time out of ſeaſon, nether abortive: but are at all times very vvellcome, &amp; profitable, on vvhat time ſoever, on vvhat manner, or of vvhome they might be brought: In vvhich facte, the maxime, or proverbe may very truely be ſpoken of Maximo Fabio, vvhoe ſayede, that all intentions, vvhich to the publiqve profite of the commonevvealthe vveare aſſayede, &amp; intēded is allvvayes vvell hopede of, to have a good evente, &amp; is eſteemede to be a happye intente, or praemeditatione: And contrarily thoſe are eſteemede infeliciouſe, &amp; vnfortunate, &amp; are of a funeſtalle, and ſorrovvfull event, vvhich are intendede, and attendede, vnto the dammage of the commone vvealthe.
            VVherfore I neede not doubte, of that vvhich I praetende to mayntayne, and publiſhe into light, ſhall of any one vvhatſoever, be taken in badde parte, becauſe I have conceavede, and publiſhede the ſame in time of iarres, and vvarres: For vvhat time might I have elected more convenient, &amp; propre, &amp; more profitable to meditate one this Chyrurgerye, vvhich compraehendeth her operatione, &amp; propre Inſtrumentes, then at this time, Fraunce beinge in all qvarters, &amp; in al partes, armed, &amp; in vveapons? &amp; animated agaynſt her ovvne entralles, &amp; vve having our ovvne mindes exvlcerated as it vveare, and hardened the one agaynſt the other, by vvhich occaſione vve to our greate greefe, and ſorrovve, muſt behoulde, at all houres, ſo manye poore vvounded, &amp; mutilatede perſons, their corps beinge vvoūded throughe the rage, and malevolence of their foes, on the vvhich vve are conſtrayned to imploy our handes, &amp; inſtrumentes to reduce agayne the ſame to theire former, and accuſtomed health agayn?

            Therfore havinge ſeene, and alſo vvith my ovvne handes practized the ſpace of tvventye yeares the operation of Chyrurgerye, in moſt of the famouſe, &amp; renoumned Cityes, of Fraunce, &amp; the Lovve Countryes, as vvell one greate, as ſmalle perſons, and that vvith ſuch diligence, and methode, that I couplinge, and comparinge, the vſe of the aunciente Chyrurgians, vvith the practice of the moderne, and latter Chyrurgians, I then endevoured my ſelfe, as much as the diſeaſe, &amp; the Patient alſo vvould permit me, to temperate, the rigoure, and ſeveritye of the firſt Operatours, or Chyrurgians, throughe the ſupple, and gentle or ſvveete dexteritye of thoſe vvhich follovved, to aſſimilate thē the one vvith the other, ſupplyinge in the counterchang, of that vvhich vvas vvantinge in the one, through the dexteritye, and induſtriouſe curioſitye of the other, reducinge the ſame vnto the beſt forme of beinge, &amp; alſoe the vvritinges, or ſcriptions, of the moſt experteſt Chyrurgiās, of this preſēt time, vvith the vvritinges &amp; iudgemēt of the vvhole, through the controulinge of the vvritinges of the one &amp; of the other: So that I have intended to make a collection: in forme of a Manuall for my ſelfe, to opitulate, &amp; addreſſe my memorye, in time of neede, and promptly to effectuate, any manualle, and not vulgare operatione: but the liberalitye throughe the vvhich I am ſo voluntarye, to communicate the ſame vnto certayne of my goode frendes, vvhoe are ſtudiouſe, &amp; deſiruoſe of Chyrurgerye, hath precipitated me into this preſent prodigalitye, of the vvhich I ſuddaynlye retired &amp; drevve my ſelfe backvvarde, bluſhing &amp; as it vveare aſhamed, cōſidering the meānes therof, as being vnvvorthy to come into light (although notvvithſtandinge everye one hath a vayne imaginatione, &amp; affectione, vnto the ſame vvhich is proceded from him) ſo that I omit the hardines vvhich I might have had, to publiſhe the ſame vnto the printe, I coulde verye difficultly contayne my deſirouſe, &amp; covetuouſe handes, of that vvhich I vvith greate laboure, dilligence, and throughe longe experience had collected together, to have in one momēt aboliſhed the ſame, if I had not purpoſed to reſerve the ſame for my ovvne particulare, and peculiare cōmodity. But my foreſayed frēdes debellating agaynſt my timorous &amp; fearfull defenſions, through certayn experiēce of time paſſed: to vvitt, that my booke of the diſeaſes of the eyes, after certayne dayes he vvas cōmited to the preſſe, vvas vnto all Ch

verye neceſſarye, &amp; profitable: and that my firſt, &amp; ſeconde Tables of Anatomye, had adminiſtred vnto all men ſuch greate ſervice, and promptitude of the Anatomy, and cogniſance of the partes of mans bodye: They have in the end reſolved me of my doubtfull feare of prodigality, addinge alſo therbye that this feare of prodigalitye, coulde be dammageable vnto noe man then vnto me, and that it coulde make noe breach into my credite at all.
            Throughe theſe foreſayed remonſtrations being convicted, &amp; perſvaded, vnder the pretexte of greate furtherance, vvhich yonger Chyrurgians might heerby reape, and not beinge poſſible for me anye longer to reſiſte, the importunitye of certayne ſproutes, &amp; beginners of Chyrurgerye, vvho vveare of opinione, that this preſent peece of vvorcke, vvith all the deformityes therof, might be profitable for them, and beinge certifiede, that if by anye means they coulde attayne them into theire handes, they vvoulde commit the ſame to the printe even ſuch as it vveare. So that I am conſtrayned to imploy my ſelfe certayne hovvres of the day, in correcting of the ſame and a little more imbelliſhe, and adorne, the ſame, vvith 4 portrayctures of mans bodye becauſe the ſame entringe into the vvorlde, might be effected vvith more favoure, &amp; credite, vvherof the tvvo firſt, doe demonſtrate all externall partes, as vvell anteriorlye, as poſteriorlye, &amp; in the other tvvo, all the ſuperficiall Vaynes, are evidently layed opē vnto vs, vvhich as little rivers doe runne throughe the face &amp; throughe all other externall partes of the bodye extende themſelves as vvell behinde as before, becauſe the ſame beinge of the yong Chyrurgians noted, they vvith leſſe daū
               ger might open anye of them.
            Farther I have enriched this vvorcke, vvith divers defigurations of Inſtruments, not of all Inſtrumentes, but of thoſe onlye, vvhich I eſteemed to be moſt neceſſarye: For even as the ſage, prudent, and vvyſe Nature, hath inſtituted ſuch an ordre, to mans body, that ſhee vvith fevv partes, can accompliſhe, manye great and excellent actions, In like ſorte muſt the Chyrurgiane, an imitatoure, and adminiſtre of Nature, endevoure, and conſtraygne himſelfe, vvith fevv Inſtrumentes to execute, and effecte, manye, &amp; greate Operations. And to ſpeake the playne truth all this greate companye and treaſure houſe of Engines, Molitiones, and of other Chyrurgicall Inſtrumentes, are more for curiouſity, &amp; oftentatione, then for anye neceſſitye, and vſe. I am alſo verye certayne of that vvhich our Hippocrates ſayeth, to vvit, that vve ought not to conſtraygne, or reſtraygne, the libertye of our corps, and the Operations, vnto the penurye, and deficience of Inſtrumentes: but much more amplifie, and enrich the ſame, vnto the commoditye of the bodye, and eaſe of the Operations: but I vvoulde rather exoptate, and deſire, that this vanitye, &amp; ſuperſtitiouſe bravadinge of Inſtrumentes, vveare ruled vvith more religiouſe mediocritye.
            Alſo I have made, a greate &amp; ample Table, or Index, in the end of the Boock, vvherin through Alphabeticall ordre I have illuſtrated, the moſt notableſt, &amp; difficulteſt thinges, vvhich in the inqviſitione might be an impediment, vnto the vnexperte in the arte of Chyrurgerye, in ſeekinge of their farther commoditye. And if ſo be any man obiecte vnto me, that this my diſcourſe, is onlye compilede together of certayne rapſodyes of the antiqve Chyrurgians: I vvillingely heere confes, &amp; acknovvledge, that in this Treatiſe, ther is verye little, or nothing at all of myne ovvne Inventione: For I am not the man vvhich liveth by an other mans mutuated ſupellectilles and I rather publiqvely confes, that I have collected all this out of auncient Chyrurgians, being greate ſhame for me to be repraehended, and ſurpriſed, of a ſecrete thefte. For vvhat noveltyes are vnder the Sunne? as the vvyſe man ſayeth: And as the Comicus ſayeth, vvhat ſhoulde vve novv adayes ſay, vvhich hath not before bin ſpoken? But I may at all times vvith veritye ſay, that I am not entred into this matter to ſovve, and feminate the ſame in an infertille grovvnde: For I have added thervnto greate amendmente, and have eradicated, &amp; vveeded out all ſpinoſities, &amp; thiſtles, vvherof they vveare repleniſhed vvith greate difficultyes, ſeqveſtringe on the one ſyde malevolēt herbes, vvhich choacked the good fruictes of the truth, compoſinge all thinges in good ordre, to adde thervnto cleernes, and facilitye: throughe the vvhich excellent, moderne, &amp; aunciente Aucthors may be vnderſtoode of thoſe, vvhich can attayn to the klovvledge of noe ſtrange langvages. Nether have ſuch Perſonages, out of vvhich I have taken anye of their operationes, obſerved in all their treatiſes one ordre, perfectlye, and one manner of operatione, but one divers places, and in divers Bookes they have diſcribed them: vvherfore they are not to be reprehended, vvho vvith a conſeqvence, have redacted them together, becauſe they might the eaſyer be compraehended, and vnderſtoode. And althoughe thoſe vvhich heeretofore have vvritten of Inſtrumētes have cō

            I knovve right vvell, that in this vvorcke ther vvilbe ſome operations of Chyrurgerye vvantinge, and that it is not vvholye perfect: But I aſſure my ſelfe, that everye man of a good ſpirite, &amp; iudgement, vvill acknovvledge, that I of purpoſe have omitted the ſame, and that eſpeciallye becauſe certayne operations, therof are not novv a dayes in vſe, &amp; practiſe: as is the manner of inſciſione of the ſkinne of the Heade, vvhich the Greeckes call Pericuphiſmos: Alſo the extirpatione of vvoemens breſtes vvhich hange toe long: of the Cauterizinge of the Liver, and of the Mil

               Collo Chyrurgiane at Paris, a perſonage ſo rare therin that all Fraunce hath not his like, vvith all dexterity to effectuate ſuch an operatione: In like ſorte alſo Mr. Pineau, alſo Chyrurgiane at Paris, vvhich is the reſplendente ſtarre of Light vnto all the Anatomiſtes of theſe times. Nether doe I doubte, that he vvhich dilligently ſearcheth this vvorcke, that he ſhall finde anye diffaulte therin: for I doubte vvhether that anye curiouſe poeple ſhoulde accompliſhe, the ſame, ſeinge the Aucthor himſelfe coulde not ſufficientlye accompliſhe the ſame: But I hope, to receave of the benevolent Reader, ſome excuſe, he notinge, and conſideringe, that ſuch operatiōs vvhich are verye titillouſe can not at one time be begunne, and alſo at the ſame time finiſhed, and that it is ſufficiente, vvith greate difficulty rightlye to imprinte the ſame. VVherfore if this enterpriſe ſeeme alienate, and ſtrange vnto any bodye, and they mocked thervvith, I certifye vnto them, that I envye noe man, vvhich can meliorize the ſame: And as touchinge thoſe vvhich ſeeme not to be in the vvorlde for anye other vſe, then to cenſure, &amp; repraehende others vvithout vvillinge yea and being able to effectuate ought thēſelves, let them ioviſe, &amp; ioy themſelves, of their privileadge, as long as pleaſeth them, vvhervvith I doe not much moleſt my ſelfe. Othervvyſe, I have vvritten only for the iunior, &amp; yonger Chyrurgians, and not for thoſe, vvhich are vvholye and completlye edoctrinized, and ſearch for nothinge els then for a perfection of all thinges: I have not exalted my harte ſo hight, as thoſe ſevere cenſurers vvoulde require, and I ſuffiſe my ſelfe vvith my accuſtomed manner, &amp; vvith the behouldinge of the commoditye of the Frenche iunioritye, of that vvhich my ſmall vvitte, could ſet forthe: I onlye deſire this one thinge of them, that they vvoulde vouchſafe to meliorize the ſame, as I certaynlye knovve they vvell can, and doe not retayne their ovvne commodity therof. And it vvilbe a greate ioy, and peaſure vnto me that therin they ſurpaſſe me: &amp; I ſhall very vvell knovve to applye the ſame to my profite, and commoditye, vvhich they throughe theire great labour, and induſtrye, have brought forth, nether vvill I conceale that vvhich of them I ſhall have learned.
            And although it be the opinion of the Sages that vve ought not to lightly, thereveale ſecretes, of Phyſicke, vnto the common, &amp; vulgare poeple treating of ſuch matters, in theire maternall, &amp; motherlye langvage, becauſe it might be eſteemed of little vvorth, &amp; be of all men little accounted of: And although I coulde eaſily, have vttered, and expreſſed my intente, in latine, yet I rather publiſhed the ſame in our French language: And that firſt of all, becauſe all annciente Learned men, vvhether they be Greeckes, Arabers, or Latiniſtes, have vvritten al theire doctrine, and experience in the maternall language. The primates, and princes of Phyſicke, Hippopocrates, and his faythfull, and fidele interpreter, &amp; commitatoure Galen, Paulus Aegineta &amp; Oribaſius doe vvitnes of the ſame. Avicenna, and Averroes, have alſo done the ſame, vvritinge in the Arabiane Langvage. Celſus and Plinius, the firſte and they vvhich have only vvritten in Latine, have alſoe done theire endevoure, and have alſo diſired to imbelliſhe, and eternize, theire Latine langvage, &amp; contrye, through the termes, and theoremes of Phyſicke. Farthermore alſo, by hovv much the more a thinge is more commone ſoe much the more is it better, and by ſo much the more may this ſcience of all men be knovvne, lauded, and extolde. The Phyſicke of Hippocrates, and of Galen, the Phyloſophye, of Plato, and of Ariſtotle, are they therfore obſcured or leſſe eſteemed of, becauſe they vveare vvrittene of the Auncientes in Latine, and Arabicke langvage? And thoſe vvhich of our time, have vvritten, in French Dutch &amp; Italiane, as manye renoumnede mē have done, vvhoe in all ſortes have indevoured, to doe ſome ſervice to the common vvealthe, hade they heere in committede anye thinge vvorthye of repraehenſion? they vvhich vvrite in vnknovvne langvages, beſydes that they are profitable vnto ſtraungers, and to theire onre native ſoyle diſcommodiouſe, are aſſimilated and reſembled vnto farmers, vvhich vvould rather till, an other mans feelde, then theire ovvne propre grovvnd, to the greate diſhonoure, ſhame, &amp; detrimente, of theire countrye, and inhabitantes.
            VVherfor I moſt humblely intreate, and obſecrate all men, to receave gratefully, &amp; thanck fullye this my laboure, and divine deſire, vvhich I have to ſee the iunior Chyrurgians, vvith all their mindes induſtriouſly labourīg to follovv &amp; imitate me: &amp; if ſo be it pleaſed &amp; that any more learned mā thē I am vouchſafede to perlegate vvith pleaſure, &amp; imploye a ſmall of their time

in the readinge, of my ſcriptſons, and vvritinges, I moſt courtiouſlye deſire thē, that they vvould more vvith good vvill, then vvith a ſpirite, vvhich to narrovvlye eſpyeth, to repraehende the faultes, vue &amp; circumſplectlye note the defaultes vvhich might be therin: Leaſt that through to greate curioſitye, and to ſeriouſe ſubtilty, that ſame happen to me, as in times paſſed, happened to the Philoſopher Theodoſio, vvho turning over the preceptes of Philoſophye vvith his right hande frō his Anditors, they vvho vvith theire lefte hande coulde alſo reach him, throughe malice, and impuritye of ſpirite, turned, &amp; miſconſtrued the ſame in badde ſorte. VVhich if ſo by anye meanes I can attayne vnto, and knovve that this my vvorcke, (publiſhed throughe the importunitye of the iunioure Chyrurgians) ſhalbe aggreeable, and acceptable, vnto manye, it vvill then adminiſtre courage, vnto me, to purſue, and addreſſe the remanent of my ſtudyes, vvherin I am entred: that is, to medidate, and to publiſhe for the yonger Chyrurgians, all thoſe thinges, vvherby Gods honoure might be increaſed, and be profitable, for the common vvealth.

Yet I vvoulde not, nor indeede coulde not partely to ſatiſfye the greate importunitye of certayne vvellvvillers of the Engliſhe natione, and poeple, but eſpeciallye of my reverente maſter, vvhoe althoughe noe Engliſhe man, yet I aſſure thee one vvho throughe certayne acqvayntance of Engliſh Captaynes in theſe Lovvcountryes, doth affect all Engliſhe men, &amp; vvoulde heerby ſhevv himſelfe gratefull not onlye vnto them, but to the vvhole ſociety of our Maieſtyes ſubiectes, by incitatinge, &amp; as it vveare compellinge me his poore ſervant heere vnto, obiectinge vnto me my inconſtant levitye, vvhoe havinge receavede ſo manye, &amp; ſo greate benefites of the poeple, &amp; ſtudentes in Englande vvoulde not imparte this excellente, exquiſite, and perpolite peece of vvorcke vnto them, ſeinge that alſo the Printer, vvas ſo vvillinge to incitate me heere vnto, heere by alſoe expreſſinge his affectionated goode vvill both to our moſt renoumnede Maieſtye (vvhome God longe praeſerve) and her ſubiectes. I ſtandinge in a dumpe, &amp; beinge vvith theſe obiections mute, Neſciens quid agerem, aut quo me verterem, not knovving vvher to hide my ſelfe, at the laſt as one beinge erectede, and ſuſcitatede out of a ſvvound, I feeblely made this anſvver, that it fitted not nether vvas agreinge to my harſhe, rude, and illiterate ſtile to beginne ſuch a peece, of vvorcke, and I being noe Engliſhe man borne might chaunce (as vvithout doubt I have) to take Siſſiphus his laboure on me, in not vvritinge goode Engliſhe. And vvhich is more, leaſt I ſhoulde attribute any occaſion of offence to my moſt reverent brother vvho beinge a Doctour of Phyſicke, &amp; I but an illiterate, &amp; ignorāt youth applying my minde vnto Chyrurgerye, might ſuppoſe me to be ſo pratchante, &amp; highminded that I ſought to aequall my ſelfe vvith him vvho through his affectione he beareth to Englande hath alſo tranſlatede an excellent booke of Phyſicke. But at the laſt I being fully reſolved of my doubtes, &amp; of thē perſuaded, that it vvould of all men be taken, &amp; conſtruede to a goode end, I coulde not any longer reſiſt their importunate aſſaultes on the imbicille vvalles of my anſvvers, but they havinge therin made a breach I vvas conſtrayned to yeelde my ſelfe a captive, &amp; acknovvledge them victors in conſentinge to their requeſtes, by takinge this laboure of Atlas on my ſhoulders. Therfore I vvoulde not vvillingelye, have that this light inconſtancye ſhoulde be obiected agaynſte me, for not impartinge vnto thee (moſt gentle Reader) theſe my obliterate lines of this experte, excellente, and perpolite Chyrurgiane Iaqves Gvillaemeau, vvhome for his excellentie of his manuale operations I aſſure thee ſuch a one hath never in Engliſhe binne trāſlated: Behould novv therfore to ſhevv my ſelfe greatefulle for thoſe benefites vvhich vvhilome I have receavede in this floriſhinge, &amp; bleſſed countrye of Englande, both in the Vniverſitye, and in the other Cityes therof, I heere humblelye praeſent vnto thee this my firſte attempte, vvho althoughe indeede no Engliſheman borne, yet bearinge a true Engliſh mans harte vnto our Maieſtye endevouringe continuallye to ſhevv my ſelfe gratefull vnto her, &amp; her ſubiectes. And althoughe it be more groſſe, &amp; impolite, then decent, &amp; convenient, to anſvver the fine, &amp; ſcoffing heades, &amp; vvittes of theſe times vvhoe allmoſt can doe nothinge els then ſcoffe, mocke, &amp; floute, at other mens induſtryes, and labours, yet I pray the (gentle Reader) not to eeſteeme them all vayne, indecent, and invtile, for Non cuivis homini contingit adire Corinthum, everye man can not have a noſe like a ſhooing horne, that is everye one hath not ſuch a fertile vvitte as they have for I acknovvledge my ſelfe to have but a barrane, &amp; vnfrictefulle grovvnde &amp; that ther doth nothinge then Filix innaſcere agris meis, and hovv is it poſſible then to reape goode Fruictes therof? And knovve (curtiouſe Reader that I take it to be a godly thinge to publiſhe ſuch a peece of vvorcke for the ayde, &amp; ſuccoure of all yonge Chyrurgians to operate, &amp; vvorcke on mās bodye, for vvhat more praeciouſe thinge is there on earth then man: and if then vve endevour to praeſerve, the health of our bodyes it is then neceſſarye to have ſuch boockes out of vvhich vve may learne the meanes vvherby vve might doe it, &amp; I have the more vvillinglye tranſlatede the ſame into the vulgare &amp; Engliſhe tunge becauſe everye one hath not the gift of langvages, &amp; although it be not ſoe exqviſitelye done as it vveare convenient it ſhoulde, tamen eſt laudanda voluntas, I have done my beſt indevoure thervnto, for ther vvher abilitye lacketh, my goodvvill notvvithſtandinge is to be receavede, and not to be repugnede, &amp; reiected. Nether ſhalt thou heere (gentle Reader) have any exquiſite methode, nor the flovving ſtile of Demoſtlenes, and eloquence of Cicero, but a playn common, and vulgare ſtile for it vvas not of the Aucthor compoſed in the firſte for ſuch mē as are experte in theſe operations, but for the commonaltye, and yonger Chyrurgians, that they heerbye might learne the true operations of

Chyrurgerye. If my boulde audacitye, or audaciouſe bouldnes ſhall adminiſter occaſione of offence to any man, I recurre to that common refuge, vvhich promiſeth remiſſione to him vvhich giveth his firſt aſſaulte. VVherfore if the learned vvill vouchſafe to reade this my firſt beginning vvithout envye, or malice agaynſt me, I ſhall thincke my induſtrye verye vvellimployede &amp; not to have beſtovved all my labour in vayne: but if through the harſhnes of my illeterate &amp; rude ſtile they are cauſed to lay it out of theire handes, &amp; ſight, yet I humblely requeſte them to take him vp agayn not for my ſake, but for his ovvne, vvhoe although defilede, &amp; poluted vvith my impolitede ſtile, yet they may gather in the garden of his exqviſite vvorckes, as fragrant gillovvfers of Chyrugicall operations (I dare avouch) as any ever vveare in Engliſhe. And if ther be anye of Momus his partakers, vvhich doe revile, ſcoffe, &amp; floute me, vvho are ſoe ſcrupulouſe, &amp; praeiudicialle, that vvith noe Phyſicke they can be cured of their criticall diſſeaſe, tell them I pray thee (gentle Reader) from me, that it is farre eaſyer for them to repraehende, then to correct or meliorize, and that they dare not for the beſt cappe they have take ſuch a thing in hande, leaſt they peradventure ſhoulde fall into the pitt vvhich for other they had made, for there is an oulde, and inveterate proverbe as I remember in Latine Quod tibi fieri non vis, alterine feceris, let them (I ſay) reade this proverbe &amp; I truſt it vvilbe a purgatiō for them. VVhat ſhall I ſay more? for indeed I can ſay nothinge as the Comicus ſayeth quod non fit dictum prius, If therbe anye vvhich vvith their Argus eyes, vvill vue, &amp; ſo narrovvlye princke, and looke, for faultes in this my labour vvithout doubte they ſhall finde faultes ſufficient, but I vvoulde requeſt them to leave their eyes at home vvith Lamia, vvhē they loock for any faultes heer in, &amp; ſpitt in a boxe, the ſpittle of quippes, &amp; quiddityes, &amp; caſt them behinde ſome cheſt of oblivione that they never may anye more be ſpoken of, and let them not diſpiſe this my poore farthing, for it may be heerafter ſhall finde my ſelfe doinge vvith ſome other peece of vvorcke more excellent. If therfor (benevolent Reader) vve finde this vvorcke to be acceptable vnto thee, my maſter ſhall thinck his motiō to have binne bleſſede and happye, the Printer his irritatione commodiouſe, and I my labours, and induſtryes vvell beſtovvede, and it ſhall be as it vveare a Calcar vnto me therafter to imploy my ſelfe vvith the tranſlatione of ſome other excellent peece of vvorcke. If not I vvoulde frendly deſire ſuch as ſcoffe heerat, to reade, &amp; dilligentlye conſider theſe tvvo verſes vvhich the Aucthor reciteth, and are theſe.

Vnto the vvhich all Artificers muſt endevoure to attayne: throughe the vvhich Chyrurgerye, although notvvithſtanding, vve can not attayne to the knovvledge, &amp; cogniſance of the preſente ſubiecte, &amp; the accidentes therof, throughe ſuch occaſions as vve have diſcribede, the ſame being as it vveare an inferioure ſcience, and dependinge, on the Naturalle, and Phyſicall ſciences: vve ought notvvithſtandinge to knovv at the leaſte this poyncte, and to obſerve, and follovve the ſame, and that throughe the moſt ſenſible, and apparent cauſes, vvhich are Materialle, and Inſtrumentalle.

                  Partes of Phyſicke.This Phyſicke agayne hath ſundrye partes, of the vvhich the firſt is Phyſiologia, vvhich handelethe and treatethe, of the ſtructure and ſituatione of mans bodye, vvherin is to be regarded and noted on the ſeaven vnnaturalle thinges. The ſecòde is Hygiena, that is a Nource, and foſterer, or praeſerver, of our health, vvhich inſtructeth, hovv vve ſhovvlde continuallye preſerve our preſente health, &amp; keepe the ſovvnde bodye liber, and free from all diſeaſſes, &amp; ſickneſſes: and this conſiſtethe in ſixe vnnaturalle thinges. The thirde is Pathologia, vvhich treatethe of the cauſe, and occaſione of the ſickneſſes &amp; of the accidentes vnto the ſame, the vvhich three thinges are agaynſte nature. The fourth is called, Simiotica, and treateth of the demōſtratinge ſignes or tokēs, not onlye of that vvhich is all readye paſſed, but alſoe of that vvhich is as yet to come, in reſpecte as vvel of ſickneſſe, as of health. The fifth is Therapeutica, that is the curinge or ſanable parte of Phyſicke, vvhich inſtructeth, &amp; learneth, hovve to repelle and cure ſickneſſes, and diſeaſes,The partes of Therapeutica &amp; reſtore agayne to former health: This praenominated Therapeutica is redivided and agayne dealed in three partes, the firſt vvherof is called, Dietetica, vvhich teacheth, hovv to obſerve a ſober &amp; good diete: The ſecōde parte, Pharmacia, vvhich inſtructed vs, hovv to compovvnde our medicaments. And the third part is callede Chirurgia, vvhich cureth or helpethe the affected patients through manualle or handlye operation for Chirurgia hath his derivatione of a Greecke vvorde, and is compovvnded of Cheir vvhich ſignifyeth a hāde, and Ergō vvhich betokeneth operatione: nether may vve by this vvorde Chirurgia not on lye vnderſtande, all operations vvhich are onlye effected by the handes, but moſt of all and eſpeciallye, all that is done, or may be done one mans bodye tovvarde the curinge of all externall diſeaſes.
               And as cōcerninge this vvorde operatione,What this vvorde operatione ſignifiethe. it is nothinge elſe, then an artificialle and normaticke applicatione, vvhich is brought to paſſe, and vvrought by the handes, one mans bodye, vvhervvith the decayed health is reiterated, and agayne reſtored.

                  IT is certayne that the praedictione, or iudgemēt of vvoūdes,The vſe of iudgement. yea alſoe the generalle knovvledge of all diſſeaſes, is a thinge moſt neceſſarye and expedient for a good Chyrurgiane: therfore Hippocrates alſoe eſtemed it verye conveniente, &amp; profitable, that a Chyrurgiane muſt excelle in the fore knovvledge of thinges, and be apt &amp; redye to give iudgement and his opinione of all diſseaſes, becauſe by that he may attayne, and at chiue vnto greate credite, and fidelitye by all men, and havinge on this manner ſet forth, and publiſhed his knovvledge ſhalbe irrepraehendable, and of all men admired, &amp; ſoe much the ſafer, &amp;, vvith more providence finiſhe his vvorcke, &amp; the boulder illuſtraete the operatione of his arte, and give iudgement ther of vvithout anye ſcoffe, or checke, and be able to give a true reporte, vvhen that by the aucthoritye of ſome learnede chyrurgiane, or by the aucthorytye of ſome Potentate, he ſhalbe therin imployede, &amp; ordayned to reporte his opinione, ether of the vvounded perſons life, ordeath, haultnes or criplenes. Even as alſoe the foreſayed Hippocrates
                  
ſayeth in his Porrhet that the Chirurgiane muſt ende voure him ſelfe to have a vviſe &amp; grave geſture,Hippocratesin his Porrhet. becauſe that if it ſoe chaunce as he adiudged it ſhoulde, he might reape honoure, &amp; goodvvil, not onlye of the patient, but alſoo of all the circumſtants, and behoulders: Contrarilye if that othervvyſe it happened or chaunced then he ſayed, and iudged it ſhoulde, and that his iudgemente fayle him, he ſhal not onlye of all mē be hated but alſoe be eſteemed as an ignorant, &amp; ſottiſhe fellovve. Beyonde all this Galenus ſayeth, and teſtifyeth vnto vs, that by our vpright, and ſincere iudgement, by the frendes &amp; Kindrede of the patiēte, althoughe he come to dye, vve ſhalbe liberated, &amp; freede from all badde reportes &amp; ſclaunders, becauſe that throughe the death vvhich conſequentlye follovved, nothinge ſhalbe alleagede agaynſt vs.
               
                  What a Chyrurgiane ought to knovve in giving iudgemētAnd for the givinge of ſuch a perfect, and complete iudgement, it is neceſſarye for the chyrurgiane not to be ignorāt, vvhich partes of the bodye beinge vvounded, eaſylye, or difficultlye may be cured, vvhich of thē are praeſent death, and in fine, the tokens hovv to knovve vvhat partes are vvounded or hurte, becauſe that out of ther natures, quallityes, &amp; diſpoſitiōs, vve may certaynlye hope, or miſtruſte of theire health, and ſafetye.
               Such iudgemente therfore ought to be taken, out of the verye beinge, and ſubſtance, or eſſence of the vvoūded parte, alſoe of the vſe, the actione, and ſituatione of the ſame, there muſt alſoe be noted, the proportione, and figure of the ſame vvounde, and the accidentes or other chaunces, vvhich are incident vnto her, conſideringe alſoe the complexione and temperature of the bodye, the ſexe, the age, on his handelinge, and trafiqve, māner of livinge, the contrye, the conſtitutione of the time then praeſent, and one the time and ſeaſon of the yeare.
               
                  All greate vyoundes are dangerous,To conclude, all men that have receaved a greate vvoūde, are ether in daunger of death or in daunger of beinge mutilate. VVe eeſteme and accounte the vvounde to be large, for thre occaſions:A great vvounde is taken three mā
                     ner of vvayes.

The ſecō
                  de, cōcerninge the vvorthynes of the vvounded parte, for although the vvounde be but little, in her meatinge yet notvvithſtandinge vve eſteeme her to be greate, becauſe that the ſtrengthe and actione, of the vvounded parte or member, is verye neceſſarye for the vvhole bodye 'and for the vvhole lyfe of man, vvhich parte havinge lefte his naturall vſe and actione, it conſequentlye follovveth that the perſonne, muſt immediatly diſceaſe &amp; dye, as vve may by experience ſee that daylye chaunceth in the vvoundes of the Braynes, of the Harte, and in the vvoundes of the Liver.
               Thirdelye, becauſe that ſome vvoundes are of a vvorſer nature, &amp; diſpoſitione, as beinge venoumede, rebellious, and entermingled vvith ſome badde and dolorous accidentes, vvhich ſometimes farre ſurpaſſe &amp; excell the vvounde it ſelfe, as it is evidentlye &amp; planlye to be ſeene in the vvoundes of the Ioynctes, vvhich immediatlye, may fall into a verye exceedinge badde eſtate, becauſe that thoſe partes and places are circumligatede or clothed vvith verye ſmalle ſtore of fleſhe, beinge onlye decked &amp; co verede vvith the Tendones, vvith ſinnues, vvith Ligaments, &amp; that verye tender, and ſenſible pellicle Perioflium, by the vvhich theſe partes or members are in more daunger of fallinge into a convulſione of ſinnues, into Phrenſye, payne, and inquietude, as much as a farre more greater vvounde in anye other parte of the bodye.
               Thoſe vvoundes are accounted incurable vvhich doe happen in the Braynes,Woundes vvhich are eſteemed incurable. or in the ventricle of the ſame, in the Harte, entrāce of the ſtomacke, in the Vena Cava, the entrāce of the Liver, the backe bone, quite throughe the Lunges, in the ſmall guttes, or entralles, the ſtomacke, the Kidnies, or in anye greate vaynes, or arteryes about the throate.Woundes that be difficulte to cure, But theſe vvoūdes vvhich vvil difficultlye be curede are they by the vvhich the Longes, the Liver, the mēbrane of the Brayns the Milte, the Matrix, or vvombe, the blather, anye of the greate guttes, or the Middelriefe, are vvoūded vvith verye ſmall vvounde. Alſoe are thoſe vvoū

                  The figure or forme of the vvoundesThere is alſoe greate heede to be taken one the manner &amp; forme of the vvoūde: for thoſe vvoūdes vvhich chaunce, or come by cruſhinge, or pletteringe, are farre vvorſe, then thoſe, vvhich are onlye hevvede, ſo that it is much better to be vvoūded vvith a ſharpe edgede or cuttinge ſvvorde, thē vvith anye other blunte vveapone vvhich is not ſharpe.
               The rounde or circle vvoundes are vvorſte &amp; difficulteſt to be curede, but the certayneſte &amp; eaſyeſte to be cured, are thoſe vvhich paſſe by the lēngth of the fibres right like a linye or line.
               The vvoundes of the Hippe, vvhich are receaved in the membranous muſcle,What the vvoundes of the hippe are, are verye exceedinge daungerous, &amp; eſpeciallye if it be a thruſte or ſtabbe,or elſe vvhē the apertione of the ſame is verye ſmalle, &amp; hath noe iſſue, but it is ſoe much the vvorſe if it ſoe chaunce ther be anye fracture or ſeparatione of bones, it be vvhere it vvil in anye place of the hippe: &amp; ſo farre forthe as if the vvounde be in anye internalle parte of the Hippe, about the greate vaynes, then the vvounde is paſſinge &amp; exceedinge daungerous, for there enſuethe out of hāde ſome greate inflammatione there vnto, &amp; conſequētlye thereafter a Gangraena, or mortificatione: he that happeneth to receave a vvounde in the foremoſte parte of his arme, is alſoe ſubiecte vnto the ſame daunger of inflammatione, and mortificatione, and cauſeth great payne &amp; trouble, becauſe that thoſe vvoundes moſt commonlye are praeſente deathe.
               
                  What vve ought to iudge out of the accidents of vvoūdes.Novv as much as belongeth vnto the judgemente &amp; opinione, vvhich is to be conſidered &amp; noted out of the accidentes of all vvoū
                  des, Hippocrates teaceth vs: in ſo much as in the greate &amp; badde vvoundes, as are the vvoundes of the Sinues, of the Tēdones, of the Ioynctes, &amp; of the bones, little or noe ſvvellinge or inflammatione at all apperareth, &amp; illuſtratethe it ſelfe it is a verye evell and badde ſigne, for vvhye, it ſignifyethe vnto vs that thoſe humors vvhich conſideringe the payne ſhoulde have aſſembled, &amp; packed thēſelves that vvaye &amp; have circumcinglede themſelves rovvnde aboute the vvoūded parte, have retracted thē
                  ſelves into ſome principalle &amp; eſpeciall parte of the bodye.
               
                  Accidētes of a de parted ſvvellinge.Thoſe vvoundes in the vvhich there appearethe anye ſvvellinge, or tumefactione verye ſelden or never fall into any Phrenſye, or into cōvulſione of Sinnues, becauſe that the venomous humors, vvhich might, aſcende &amp; dravve tovvarde the Braynes or into the ſinuiſhe partes of the boddye, have congregate and gatherede thēſelves together aboute the vvounde: but if that one the ſuddayne the ſvvellinge vvithout anye evidente reaſon, as in example, in the applyinge of anye remedyes, throughe purgations, or throughe phlebotomiſinge or bloode lettinge, came to departe &amp; vvith dravve it ſelfe into ſome other place and that in ſuch, as are vvounded behinde in there backe bone, that perſone is troubled vvith convulſione of ſynnues, through the vvith dravvinge of the matter, into the ſinnuiſhe partes of the backebone:and the vvounde beinge in the foremoſt partes of the bodye, and the matter of the ſvvellinge, aſcēdinge vpvvardes, throughe the greate vaynes, tovvarde the Braynes, the patient ſtrayghtvvay fallethe into a madneſſe &amp; Phreneſye: or if ſoe be that the matter dravve tovvarde the breſte, then ther enſue greate &amp; intollerable ſtitches, or Apoſtemations, becauſe that thoſe badde humors can not by anye meanes poſſible be conſumed or vvaſtede, but deſcende &amp; ſincke dovvne into the cō
                  cavitye of the breſte. And if that the ſvvellinge novv departinge be of a verye highe &amp; redde colloured, &amp; that thervvas ſtore of bloode therin, vvhich is deſcended &amp; ſuncke dovvne tovvarde the guttes, then it neceſſarylye &amp; cō
                  ſequentlye fellovveth that the patiente falleth into the Blodye flyxe, or Dyſenterye.
               As farre forthe therfore as there procedethe anye convulſione of ſynnues out of a vvounde,The convulſione in vvoundes is verye daungerous. &amp; eſpeciallye from anye greate inflammatione, that is a ſigne of deathe, for therbye vve may playnlye, note, &amp; marke that the ſynnuiſhe partes of the bodye, muſt needes be hurte, and that the Braynes are in ſome, or other paſſione.
               If that into anye vvoūdes, vvhich have fiercelye bledde anye Spaſmus happen, that is a bad ſigne.
               All thruſtes of the ſinnues, and Tendones,Thruſtes in the ſynnues are very daū
                     gerous. are verye daungerous, and eſpeciallye, vvhen as the ſkinne and the fleſhe chaunce to ſhutt together, for therin engenderethe a ſharpe &amp; corrodinge matter, vvhich reſuſcitatethe and cauſethe greate &amp; intollerable payne, becauſe ſhe can not by anye meannes get iſſue, out of the vvhich procedethe &amp; follovvethe convulſione of ſynnues, inflammatione, and a Gangraene, or mortificatione.The Organicke partes, vvhich are vvholye cut of can noe more be reſtored agayn. In ſoo much as anye eſpeciall and principalle, or Organicke parte, or anye inſtrumentalle parte, totallye &amp; vvholye is hevved of, and ſequeſtred and ſeparatede from the bodye, it can not by anye meanes be reſtored and cured, becauſe that the blode, and the vitalle Spirites are vvholye exhalated, throughe the greate vaynes, vvhich are cleane a ſunder, and that by the vvhich the cure muſt be done, and the foregoinge health agayne reſtorede.
               The temperature of the boddye, the time of the yeare, the age the handlinge and trafique, and the manner of the patients livinge,

the knovvledge of the cōtrye are a greate helpe &amp; ayde for the prognoſticatione of vvoundes: a childe, or a yongemā, vvhich as yet is in-his grovvth vvil better and vvith more eaſe be healed or curede, then an aged perſonne: and a ſtronge mā, a greate deale ſooner then a feeble, and debile perſon. A leane and ſclender perſone, vvilbe curedevvith more facilitye, then a thicke, and groſſe lived man. And a ſounde bodye farre ſooner, then a ſicke and corrupte bodye. That man vvhich laboureth, eaſier, then a ſtillſittinge and idle perſone. A ſoberman, farre ſooner, then a bancketter, and one that haunte the hoores. The moſt conveniente time of the yeare, to cure &amp; heale a vvoūde, is in the fore ſummere or Vernall time of the yeare, or at the leaſt in ſuch a time, in the vvhich it is nether to hotte nor to coulde, becauſe that extreame heate, or extreame coulde,are the enymyes of all vvoundes, and eſpeciallye the changinge of heate, &amp; of coulde, vvherfore alſoe the fore vvinter or Autūnus, is verye vnprofitable for the ſame. In ſome regions and countryes,Other cō
                     ſideratiōs to be his in prognoſticatinge. the vvoundes are ether eaſyer, or difficulter to becurede: for at Rome, the vvoundes of the heade are difficulter to be curede, then the vvoundes of the Legges, the vvhich notvvithſtandinge at Avignon vve finde cleane contarye.
               As farre as the vvounded perſon keepe and continue his perfecte Sence, and memorye nether gettethe anye agues, vve may then aſſure our ſelves, that the vvounde vvil quicklye and eaſylye be curede. VVe ought not thetfore to diſcourage the patiente, althoughe, he have an ague by the greate vvoū
                  de, as longe as the inflammatione is yet before hande, and as longe as there engenderethe anye matter. But an ague is verye daungerous,Signes to the contrarye. vvhē ſhe iſſuethe from a ſmall vvounde and eſpeciallye, vvhen ſhe hath longe continuance, after the inflammatione, and ſupuratione, or vvhen ſhe incitateth the patient vnto Phreneſye. VVhen the patient parbrakethe againſt his vvil, greene galle, or immediatlye vvhen he hath receaved the blovve, or at the time vvhile the inflammatione is as yet duringe, that is alſoe a badde ſigne, eſpeciallye in theſe vvhich are vvounded in a ſynnue, or in annye ſinnuiſhe place: But the parbrakinge, or vomitinge, vvhich commeth by the frevvil of the patiente. is nothinge ſuſpicious, eſpeciallye in thoſe, vvhich are vſed to vomitinge, if that a man praeſentlye after meales, or after that the inflammatione is come, or the vvounde being in the heade,Conſideration for the vvonds of the heade. doe not come to vomite. The Chyrurgiane muſt vſe greate foreſight, in givinge iudgemēt of the vvoundes of the Heade, for the aunciente Chyrurgians, have alvvayes eſteemed thē doubtfulle &amp; ſuſpect, becauſe of other badde accidentes vntil the Fifteenth day, and the moderne and, ionge profeſſors, vntill the hundred the day.
               The Iuriſts, or lavvyers, have conſtituted and ordayned fifteene dayes, for the iudgement of the vvoundes of the Heade, to knovve of a certayntye, vvhether the patient by occaſione of that vvoūde came to dye or not or by reaſone of his ovvne faulte, or by any other occaſione. Becauſe therfore, that the yonger Chyrurgiane, ſhall not be over raſhe, in givinge of his iudgement, leaſte he come te glyde and falle into anye badde reportes, or in anye repraehenſione. As much as appartayneth vnto me, I have knovvne ſome, vvhich have continued in a verye good eſtate vnto the thirteenth, fourteenth, or vntill the fifteenth day, and then have fallen into agues, and manye other accidentes, by the vvhich they in the end chaūced to dye. VVee muſt alſoe note, that all naughtye and badde, accidents moſt of all publiſhe themſelves, at the full Moone, more then at other times, becauſe as then all maner of moyſture grovveth and increaſeth more, then in the decreaſinge of the Moone, &amp; alſoe more in the ſommer, then in the VVinter.
               The ſignes and tokens of the deadlye fractures of the ſculle, are agues in the VVinter,The ſignes of the deadly fractures of the ſculle. before the fourteenthe daye, and in the ſommer before the ſeaventhe day: Item, a naughtye and badde colloure of the vvounde: little matter of the ſame: mortificatione of that vvhich is inflamed: ſlimye or viſcouſe conſiſtence of that vvhich is corrupted: drieth ariditye in the ſkinne of the heade, as it is in a peece of pouldrede fleſhe, vvith a brouvvne, leadiſhe, and blacke colloure, vvhich ſignifyeth the beginninge of the corruptinge and putrifyinge of the ſculle, vvhich thē vvaxeth ravve, as vve may ſee, vvhen it is rotten, and grovvne blacke: vvheras before it vvas even and ſmoothe.

               The patient beginneth to rage, he hath little pimples one his tonge, he getteth alſoe convulſione of ſynnues, one the contrarye ſyde of the vvounde: ſome fal inte an Apoplexia vvheron follevvethe deathe.

The goode ſignes of healinge, in the fractures of the Heade, after that it is trepanede, or els after that the brokē parcells of bones, are taken out of the Heade, are theſe namelye vvhen that the Membrane of the Braynes hath her naturalle colloure, and her naturalle motione &amp; ſtirringe: vvhen the engendringe and grovvinge Fleſhe is redde.

To the vvhich end &amp; purpoſe, he muſt note vvhat vvoūdes, in the vvhich the bullets have binne ſhott, are incurable, or difficulte, or eaſye to be cured, becauſe that vve may admoniſhe, the frendes, and kindrede of the patiente, of thoſe accidentes vvhich might happen vnto the vvoūde, the bullet beinge dravvne therout, alſoe of the certayntye or feare, vvhich throughe the daūger, vve are to expecte, of the healinge of the ſame.Adviſe of Celſus. For firſt of all Celſus ſayeth, that a prudente, and vvyſe Chyrurgiane, ſhall not at anye time take in hāde, ſuch a patient, for vvhome it is impoſſible to be curede, &amp; eſcape death, becauſe he adminiſter noe occaſione vnto others to ſuſpecte, &amp; thincke, that he hath berefte the patient of lyfe, vvhich othervvyſe throughe the bad fortune of his vvounds is diſceaſed. And ſeinge that the daūger is greate, but yet notvvithſtā
                  dinge entermingled vvith ſome good hope, thē he ſhal admoniſhe the frendes of the patiente, that the matter is heavye, and ſuſpecte, becauſe if ſo be the arte &amp; ſcience, be ſuppreſſed, and overvvonne of the diſſeaſe, that they ſhould not as then thincke, ether that he hath not knovvne therof, or els that he hath ſought to abuſe the frendes. But that ſuch is the office, and the dutye, of a vvyſe and prudent Chyrurgiane, alſo is it the facte of a Runnagate Qvackſalver and deceaver, to make anye thinge, ſeeme to be verye daungerous, vvhich of it ſelfe is eaſye, and light, becauſe vve ſhoulde thincke, more arte to be in him, then indeede theris. It is alſoe ſeemlye, that the Chyrurgiane cōfeſſinge, the cure to be eaſye &amp; light, doe paune his credit, &amp; reputation, becauſe as thē he might the more vvillinge, thincke one that, vvhich might be moſt commodious and profitable, to the curinge and healinge of the patient, and that the diſſeaſe vvhich of it ſelfe is ſmalle, throughe the negligence of thoſe, of the vvhich the patient is kepte, be made noe greater.
               To this end Paulus Aegeneta counceleth vs,Opinione of Paulus Aegineta. that if ſo be, the bullet continue, or tarrye, in anye of the vvorthyeſt partes of the bodye, as in the Braynes, Harte, Liver, or throte, in the kidnies, bladder, or Matrice, and the ſignes, &amp; tokens of death revealinge themſelves vve cā

VVe have alſoe at ſome times in a vehemēte &amp; greate ſquinantie, perced &amp; made an apertione in the throte. But if ſoe be that vve ſuffer the bullet to continue in the bodye, or in anye parte of the ſame, vvithout extractinge of the ſame, vvhen that eaſylye he may be dravvne forth, it neceſſarylye follovveth, that the patiēt muſt dye therofe, it might alſo bringe the Phyſicion, or Chyrurgiane into the name of beīge cruell, &amp; mercyleſſe, vvher other vvyſe the bullet beīge dravvne forth, it might be that the patient might as yet be curede, vvherfore the Chyrurgiane muſt alvvayes endevoure &amp; doe the beſt he can, vvhen he hath forttoulde, &amp; admoniſhed the frendes of the patient, of the daunger, becauſe ſome times greate &amp; fearfull vvoūdes beyōde the expectatiōs of all mē are cured, vvherfore vve ought not at anye, time to permit or ſuffer the patiēte vvithout helpe or ſuccoure, vvhere ther is anye ſmalle hope of beinge cured.We muſte not at anye time leave the patient.

                  Conſideration of bulletes,Above all that the Chyrurgiane muſt conſidere, on the vvounded parte, he muſt alſoe farther conſider one the differēce, &amp; varietye of bulletes, vvhich conſiſteth, in the matter, forme, qvantitye, number, and facultye of the ſame. As concerninge &amp; touchinge the matter, althoughe that the foreſayed bulletes, moſt commonlye are of leade yet for all that ſometimes the beſieged, &amp; they that ſkermiſhe in the feelds are conſtrayned to vſe tinne bullets, Copper, peeces of iron, ſteel, peaſen, yea &amp; alſoe little ſtones or pebles. As concerninge the figure or forme therof they are moſt commonlye rovvnde, although ther are ſome ſhotte vvith three corners, ſome foure corners, &amp; ſome of other faſhons. Touchinge the qvantitye, ther is great difference concerninge the greatenes of the peeces, by the vvhich the bullets are ſhott. As for the nūber, &amp; conſtitutione of the foreſayed bullets, ther are ſome vvhich ſhoote, vvith more. thē vvith one bullet, vvith ſome vvhich are faſtened the one, vvith the other, vvith little chayned Bullets, vvith hayle ſhote, vvhich ſpreade thē
                  ſelves, in the bodye of a man. Speakinge of the forces or facultyes, of bullets I have not as yet geven anye credite vnto them that ſayed the bullets might be poyſened, becauſe as yet ther hath binne never a famous Chyrurgiane vvhich ever had a venomous ſhotte vvounde in hande in theſe our tymes vvhich hath made anye mētione therofe, as is playnlye ſhevved, in the diſcourſe of the diſceaſed the right vvorſhipfull M Ambroſius Paré, chiefe Chyrurgiane to the kinge his maieſtye vvhich hath verye learnedlye diſcuſſed &amp; as it vveare grovvnded this queſtione in his boockes of Chyrurgerye.

                  WHen that the Chyrurgiane ſhall have cōſidered, one the parte, &amp; alſo a little obſerved, one the varietye, &amp; difference of bullets, he ſhall chuſe, a certayne nūber of inſtrumentes vvhich cōtinuallye he ought to have by him, eſpeciallye thoſe, vvich he ſuppoſeth to be moſt fitteſt to dravv forth the fore ſayed bullet vvith moſt facilitye &amp; eaſe.We muſt endevoure to dravve forth the bullete at the firſt dreſſinge. The vvhich he ſhall at the firſt dreſſinge, vvithout anye longer delaye, vnto the next daye, put in vre and practiſe: for the bullet beinge dravvne out, ſhall the patiēt, &amp; Chyrurgiane alſoe be freed from great daunger, the vvhich both of them vvith all right ought to deſire and longe for. The bullet may alſoe praeſentlye, vvhile the vvounde is freſhe &amp; greene, be felt vvith the finger, or moſt fitlye vvith the privet or ſearchinge irō vvithout tarryinge vntill the next daye, becauſe that the vvounded parte, throughe anye concurringe humors, ſvvelleth out of hāde, throughe the payne of the vvounde, by the vvhich the entrance of the vvounde cōmeth to ſvvelle, as alſoe throughe the force of the bullet, anye of the Mēbranes or Tē

But if vve feared, leaſt vve ſhoulde put the patiēt to ſome intollerable payne, throughe the diſtendinge of the ligamentes, &amp; tēdones, my councell is as thē, that the yonge Chyrurgiane, endevoure, to follovve and vſe the ſame, vvhich I did or have vſed on my lorde of Floyon: vvhich in the ſkirmiſhe of Maeſtricht,A notable Hiſtorye. got a ſhott in his knee, the bullet lyinge faſte, &amp; occulte in the iovncte betvveē the bones, the vvhich nether I, nor anye chyrurgianes, of Dō Ihon of the Eeaſte, coulde finde, at the laſt it ſeemed good vnto me, agaynſte the opiniōs of all the reſte, vve ſhoulde ſhutt &amp; foulde together the knees of the patient: vvhich he doinge vvith ſome payne, the bullet, through the fouldīge of the Knees, &amp; the bones vvhich placed &amp; preſſed thēſelves together, vvas drivē therout, &amp; revealed it ſelfe externallye, vnder the ſkinne, and one the ſydes of the foreſayed ioyncte, vvher I havinge made a little inſciſione, my ſelfe have takē the ſame forth of that place.
               In like ſorte, if ſoe be the bullet,We muſt dilate the vvounde if the bone be dilacerated have rebovvnded agaynſt anye bone, and the bone throughe the violēce therof be broke, &amp; cruſhed to divers peeces, &amp; the bullet as yet remayninge therin, or elſe havinge pearced quite throughe, it is as then the ſureſt vvay to dilate the vvounde, as farre forth as the vvounded parte is able to ſuffer, it, &amp; that ether in the entrance, or iſſue of the vvounde, at the leaſt if it have an iſſue: the vvhich beinge finiſhed, vve ſtrayghtvvayes vvith the finger, or vvith anye other inſtrumēte, muſt ſearch for the ſplīter, and finelye dravve forth, thoſe parcels vvhich vvholye are ſeparated frō the bone, &amp; alſoe in like ſorte, the bullet, if ſoe be as yet he ſticketh therine: &amp; if that ther vveare anye greate peeces, or parcells of the bone, vvhich as yet are not vvholye ſeparated frō the bone, but are yet faſtened vvithe the Perioſtium, or the ligamentes, vve muſt not vvith anye violēce dravve thē forthe, becauſe throughe ſuch violēce vve might vrge great payne &amp; convulſione of ſynnues, vvherfore it is farre beter to place &amp; ſituate them by the bone, on the vvhich as yet they are halfe faſtened: For nature, expellethe them moſt cōmonlye vvithe the matter forth of the vvounde, vvithout anye payne, they ſeparate alſoe frō the bone, throughe the increaſinghe of the nevve fleſhe, the vvhich repelleth the ſame from him, or els in time they

                  Good doctrine for a Chyrurgiane.
                  ALlthoughe, the bullet be of anye ſtrange, &amp; alienate, ſubſtance, yea alſoe as intollerable for nature, as is the livinge vvith the deade, the principalle intentione, to cure all vvoundes is, that vve muſt firſt ſeparate that, from the vvounde vvhich oppugneth nature, yet notvvithſtandinge ought not the Chyrurgiane be too curious, in ſeekinge all contrarye thinges in the vvound or to too boulde &amp; audacious, in dravvinge thē out, except he lightlye or eaſylye, can finde them, &amp; vvithe ſmall payne &amp; greefe to the patient cā dravve them out.

                  ſieur of Chardon, the firſt gentleman, of my lorde the Cardinalle of Bourbō, vvho beinge the Chapelayne, of my lorde of Angviē, hath gotten a ſhot in the ſkirmiſhe of St. Laurent, in the middeſt of his legge, of the vvhich ſhot the bullet, remayned faſt ſtickinge therin, the vvounde beinge vvholye, &amp; compleatlye cured, vvithout perceaving in 28 yeare anye hī

                  branes, and ſoe faſt grovvne, and ioyned together, as if the bone, the membrane, &amp; the bullet, had all of them binne but one ſubſtance. It happeneth alſoe ſomtimes that the bullet through his ponderouſenes, &amp; heavyenes by degrees, deſſendethand ſincketh dovvnvvardes, tovvardes the exterior ſkinne,The bullet throughe his ponderouſnes ſincketh dovvnvvardes. that parte notvvithſtādinge beinge cured, throughe the vyhich he deſcēdeth or ſincketh, vvithout the perceavīge of the patiēt, vvher, vvithout anye greate trouble or moleſtatione of the patiēt, he may be cut out, vvhich one this manner is farre ſurer, thē if in the firſte vve hadd tormē

                  An example of Hippocrates. vvhich reciteth to have cured a certayne perſonage, vvhich had receaved a ſhot vvith an arrovve, in his flanckes, vvher of the heade, or iron, tarryed therin, and yet agaynſt the opinione of all men, is therof cured &amp; helped: vvhich foreſayed arrovve heade or peece of iron, ſixe yeares therafter he tooke from him. Paulus Aegineta alleageth,Paulus Aegineta. that he hath of ten times ſeene, that the arrovves have binne loſt in mens bodyes, &amp; that the ſame, in a longe time therafter, the vvounde beinge cured, are throughe apoſtematione of that parte come agayne to light &amp; revealed themſelves. Albucaſis ſayeth, that he alſoe hath ſeene one,An example of Albucaſis vvhich vvas ſhott vvith an arrovve into his ſhoulder, of the vvhich ſhott, the foreſayed arrovve, therin ſtucke faſt, &amp; yet for all that is cured, but that the arrovve, ſeaven yeare therafter at the length throughe the bone Coccix is come forthe and taken out. VVherfore vve muſt not be to curious, in dravvīge forth the bullet, vvith great daunger, &amp; torment to the patient, &amp; to our vtter ſhame &amp; diſgrace.

The fracture at ſometimes alſoe is ſoe greate, vvith ſuch a huge quantitye of maſſacred, and cruſhed bones, vvhich lye halfe, and halfe ſeparated, or els for the moſt parte cleane beaten theroute, that vve may playnlye vvith our eyes behoulde the membrane Dura mater, ſoe that the bloode vvhich driveth therone, may verye eaſylye flovve out of the vvounde, in like forte allſoe may the remedies therin eaſyly be applyed: To the vvhich fractures, the trepane is nothīge behoovinge or nedefull: And if ſo be in anye ſorte you perceave anye ſkilfers or ſplinters, by the vvhich that membrane might be pricked, or cruſhed, you muſt take them verye eaſylye therout.

                     HIppocrates chargeth the Chyrurgiane,Opinione of Hippocrates. in his booke concerninge the vvoundes of the heade, vvhen as in the firſt he hath binne therūto fetched or ſent-for, havinge together noted, the fracture of the bone, vvith the moleſtinge and troubleſome accidentes therof, that vvithout anye longer delaye, he ſhall vvithin the ſpace of thre dayes beginne to trepane, and eſpeciallye the vvether beinge hotte, therby to prevent the inflammatione: but not to the membrane, leaſt ſhe lye bare, and ſoe the externall ayre chaūce to diſtemper her, and cauſe therine ſome corruptione and rottinge, leaſt alſo that in ſo doinge vve might chaunce to teare the membrane, in boaringe through the ſculle vvhich cleaveth vnto the ſame, or anye of the other faſteninges of the membrane: or in placinge of the inſtrument theron, ſhe might therby be hurt or vvoūded. VVherfore, (as he ſayeth) it is farre better, vvhen as ther is but a little more bone to pearce or boare throughe, &amp; the barede bone beginneth to ſtirre it ſelfe, that as then vve deſiſte, vntill ſuch time as it of him ſelfe falleth out.The Chyrurgiane is ſometimes to late ſent for. But if ſoe be that the Chyrurgian hath not in the firſt binne therat preſent, &amp; the patient hath of ſome idiote or ignorāt fellovv binne dreſſed, vvhich hath not knovve the fracture, and becauſe ther vvas noe apertione made in the bone, to give ayre or light, vnto the matter, ther are chaunced thervnto (as is a fore recited) greate inflammations, and manye other fearfull accidentes: vve muſt then (if it be in the ſummer, and the putrifactione one the ſuddayne reveale it ſelfe) vvithin the ſeaventh day treparte the patiēt, before the braynes are vvholye infected, and chaunce to mortifye:

But in the vvinter vvhen as the corruptione procedeth and goeth ſomvvhat tarder ofſloer forvvarde, vve muſt then effect it vvith in 14 dayes: becauſe theſe dayes beinge paſſed, as vvel conſideringe the imbicillitye of his forces, as the greatnes of the diſſeaſe is incurable, although as then vve trepane the ſcull, it is then to late, vvherfore in noe vvyſe muſt vve effect or doe it.
               
                  Opinione of Avicenna.
                  Avicenna vvil have that vve ſtrayght vvayes beginne to trepane, and if ſo be vve muſt needes deferre it, that vve ſhoulde deferre it noe longer then tvvo or three dayes at the moſt, and that eſpeciallye vvhen as the Dura mater is pricked or lyeth cruſhed, of anye broken bones.
               
                  Celſus ſayeth, that he vvhich tarrieth anye longer from trepaninge then three dayes, are not to be excuſed, becauſe that ſuch delay cauſeth a concurſione of humors, on the Dura mater vvhich findinge noe apertione, or iſſue, diſordereth the foreſayed membrane, and ſpoyleth it, out of the vvhich neceſſarylye muſt follovv greate inflammationes.
               But our vſe and practiſe in theſe dayes, is that as ſoone as vve are ſent for, vvhether it be in time or out of time, earlye or late, and vve eſpye, ether through ſearching vvith our, fingers, through the ſearchinge iron, or by our ſight, that the ſcull is broken, rente, or torne, and that the Dura mater ſuffereth anye thinge, vve out of hande proceede vvith the operatione, and that ſoe much the ſooner, vvhen as vve note, that ther accidentes demonſtrate themſelves, vvithout anye longer delay and eſpeciallye, in debile aegritudinous, or corpulent bodyes, becauſe in them ther are revealed farre vvorſe accidentes then in others, vvherfore to tarrye or deferre the trepaninge anye longer it vvould be ſmalle commoditye vnto vs, but better that altogether vve deferred it.
               And althoughe the Chyrurgiane vveare not in the firſt ſent for, and that the ſeaventh day of the ſommer, and the 14 of the vvinter vveare praetermitted, and let paſſe, he ſhall not therfore refuſe to doe his vtter moſt endevoure, vvith trepaninge, for it is yet better ſomvvhat to late them never, conſideringe the goode hope vvhich vve muſt have of doinge the patient anye good, helpe, and comforte, vvhich othervvyſe vvithout trepaninge of the broken bone, or the elevatione of the ſame, can by noe meanes be done, vvhich vve onlye vnderſtande of thoſe, vvhich are not cleane vvithout hope.
               
                  What places may beare the trepaninge.Seinge therfore that vve have the time &amp; day limited vnto vs, in the vvhich vve ougt to trepane, vve muſt cōſider vvhat places, or partes of the ſculle are able to abide the trepaninge, and vvhich not. VVe muſt firſt of all ther fore conſider, that the bones vvhich vvholye are in peeces, or beinge cruſhed, or at the leaſt a great parte of the ſame beinge ſeparated, can not eaſylye be trepaned, becauſe he might chaunce to cruſhe the trepane one the membranes, hovve eaſylye ſoever he leane theron. VVe muſt alſoe note, that vve doe not chaunce to ſett the trepane one any ſuture, becauſe in ſoe doinge, vve ſhould vvith great payne, and vvith great bloode ſheddinge, cut of the vaynes, arteryes, and ſynnuiſh filamentes, vvhich have a vnitye and faſteninge, vvith the Pericranium, and the membrane Dura mater,
                  We may right vvell trepane one the ſydes of the future. vvhich have the free paſſage throughe the foreſayed ſutures, to retayne the Dura Mater, and adminiſter life, and nurture vnto her. But if it ſoe chaunced that the fracture chaunced to be one the ſuture, vve muſt then applye the trepane, on both the ſydes of the ſuture, vvith out in the leaſt touchinge of her: for if ſoe be vve trepane but on the one ſyde onlye and not at the other ſyde of the ſuture it vveare then impoſſible that the bloode or matter, ſhould have at that hole anye iſſue or paſſage, the membrane beinge betvvixt them both: nether may vve trepane on the fontanelle, or openinge of the heade in yonge Children, becauſe that ther tendere imbicillitye as yet is notable to ſuffer and abyde the trepane. The inferior, or deſcending partes of the ſculle, are not convenient or fitt to be trepaned, becauſe the braynes throughe ther ponderouſnes, might chaūce to ſincke therout, or the membranes throughe the apertione might chaunce to be extruded: But if ſoe be vve vveare vrged ther vnto, vve muſt make but a verye ſmalle apertione.
               VVe ought in noe vvyſe to trepane the temples of the heade,We may not trepane the temples of the heade. becauſe vve ſhoulde not hurte the temporalle muſcle, conſideringe divers ſynnues, arteryes and vaynes, vvhich are therin divided and entermingled throughe the vvhich there might be cauſed to greate payne, fluxione of bloode, agues, Spaſmus, and the patient might chaunce to dye: Becauſe that ther vnder the bone called Os petroſum is ſituated, and that conſideringe, the movinge and ſtirringe in the temporall muſcle, vvhich happeneth in ſpeakinge or eatinge, the vvoūde might be farre more daungerous, and Hippocrates alſoe ſayeth, that the inſciſione of the ſame muſcle, might be cauſe of a greate, and villanouse diſtortione out of the vvhich one the ſame ſyde, a Paraliſis on the other a cōvulſione of ſynnues might chaunce to enſue. Nether ought vve to trepane that parte of the ſculle, a little above the eye brouvves, becauſe in this place ther is a greate concavitye, fylle of ayre, and vvhite ſlimye,

mye, humiditye, of nature, in that place cōſtituted &amp; ordayned, to paepare the ayre, vvhich aſcēdeth vp to the braynes, the vvhich indeed is vvorthye to be knovvne &amp; obſerved, becauſe that the Chyrurgiane, might not in anye ſort be deceaved, takinge the foreſayed concavitye to be, a depreſſione of the bone, vvhich needes muſt be trepaned: &amp; if it ſo chaunced, that anye of theſe foreſayed partes vveare brokē, as are the temples of the heade, vve ought then to applye the trepane, a little above the tēporall muſcle:Vve may not trepane that bone above the eyebrovves. if ſoe be that the part or portione of the ſculle, be broke a little above the eyebrovves, vve muſt as then make choyſe of that parte of bone, vvhich boundeth on the fracture, as above in the fooreheade: it is right true, that if ſo be the foreſayed bones, vveare depreſſed, and cruſhed, that as thē vve ought to elevate them, and if they be cleane ſeparated vve as then muſt plucke them out in like ſorte as vve muſt doe in the ſutures.
               
                  The ſutures and temples of the heade may ſometimes be trepaned.Yet conſideringe all this, vve are oftētimes compelled &amp; conſtrayned, to trepane in all places of the ſcull: The vvhich a renoumned, &amp; experte Chyrurgiane called Andreas a cruce, confeſſeth often times to have done, vvithout anye daunger. And I dare my ſelfe bouldlye affirme, that I in the yeares, of 1591 &amp; 1592 have my ſelfe trepaned, and have ſeene others trepane, in the foreſayed prohibited places, as one the ſutures, and one the temples of the heade. Notvvitſtandinge I vvould councell the yonge Chyrurgiane, that in as much as is poſſible he avoyde &amp; eſchevve, the trepaninge of theſe places, but rather make choyſe of anye other parte, vvhich parte, may be a little deſcendinge, becauſe havinge made the apertione, the bloode, the matter, &amp; all impuritye might therout have ther free paſſage. Conſideringe in the dayes vvhich goe before and vvhich conſeqventlye follovve after the trepaninge, on the ſingularitye, and vvorthines of tvoſe partes, vve muſt commaunde the afflicted and vvounded perſone, that in all thinges he vvilbe ſober, and obſerve a good diet, both in etinge and drinckinge, abſtayninge eſpeciallye from vvine, and phlebotomye, as much as is needfull, becauſe that the humors, ſhoulde not concurre vnto the vvoūded parte, and that alſoe vve keepe his heade vvarme, vvith light coveringes of the heade, becauſe coulde is a greate enymye vnto the braynes &amp; all ſynuiſ he partes.

Firſt of all therfore, vve muſt vvholye take avvaye all the broken and cruſhed bones, vvhich vvholye are ſeparated from the ſovvnde parte, and alſoe from the Pericranium, conſideringe that they can never thervvith be vnited &amp; ioyned agayn. But vvhē as the broken bone is depreſſed, &amp; anye parte therof as yet theron vveare faſtened, vvith the ſovvnde partes therof, vvhich cruſhed the membranes of the braynes, or any acuitye of the ſame, as yet ſticke therī, vve muſt not therfor for all that cut it of, and vvholye take it avvaye. But muſt by all meanes endevoure, eaſyly to lift &amp; elevate the ſame, &amp; ſituate it next vnto the borderinge bones, exemptinge only out of the ſame the ſmall peeces, vvhich might hurte the membrane, &amp; pricke it, becauſe by this curinge &amp; remedye, the bones agayne renevve, vnite, and ioyne themſelves together vvith the circumiacent bones. In ſoe much as if ther be anye more rentes or fiſſures before hādes, vvhich frō the one ſyde, diſperſe themſelves this vvay or that vvay, vve ſhall not neede to purſue thē vnto theire end, but vve ſhall onlye take ſome parte therof avvay, becauſe moſt commonlye they ioyne, &amp; ſaulder as it vveare together agayne, the vvhich is a farre more better opercle for the braynes, thē that nevve incarnated fleſhe, vvhich after the trepaninge grovveth therin, vvhere vve have taken the vvhole broken bone therout, vvherfore vve muſt take noe bones therout, then vvith greate diſcretione, &amp; then as fevve as is poſſible,The ſcull is the naturall opercle, or cover to the braynes. ſoe that they doe not pricke, &amp; trouble the membrane, vvith ther acuitye &amp; edge, &amp; that ther remayne diſtance enoughe, to give paſſage vnto the bloode, and the matter vvhich is therone gatherede, to departe, for as vvel the membrane as the braynes, ſhalbe better defended, through the bone vvhich as yet they Keepe, vvhich is ther naturall defēce, as if vve qvite &amp; cleane toke it avvay, through vvhich diſcoveringe, the foreſayed braynes might be hurte or hindered.

There is a certayne induſtrye in the depreſſione of the trepane, ſoe that it both turneth rounde, &amp; pearceth or cutteth alſoe: for if ſo be vve leane to lightlye therone, it then pearceth and cutteth litle, or nothīge at all: &amp; if it ſoe chaū
                  ced that as then vve depreſſed is ſomvvhat to harde, it vvill not then turne rounde, vvherfore heerine vve muſte vſe a medium betvven them both, or mediocritye, &amp; lifte it ſome times out, to purifye, &amp; bruſhe it, and then annoynte it vvith oyle of roſes, becauſe that it might the betre pearce and enter in. The trepane having novv made a reaſonablve deeped circle, as then vve muſt take avvay the poynte out of the middle therof, for if it pearced deeper thē the crovvne or teeth of the trepane, he ſhoulde be ſooner paſſed by or throughe the bone then the trepane vvith his teeth, by the vvhich the membrane called Dura Mater might chaunce to be hurte, the foreſayed poyncte therfore beinge taken therout, vve muſt agayne ſett the trepane in his hole, or circkle, and markinge that the trepane hath pearced the Diploe,
                  Signes to knovve vvhē the trepane is entred into the Diploe. and paſſed therbye, the vvhich me may perceave by the blood vvhich vvil iſſue therout, throughe thoſe little vaynes vvhich there are openede, vve muſt then finniſhe the trepaninge vvith more diſcretione and heede takinge ther vnto, vnto the concavitye of the ſculle, turninge the foreſayed trepane verye eaſylye &amp; vvyſelye, layinge the left hand verye lightlye therone, that therbye vve may the better eſpye, vvhen that the ſculle ſhalbe pearced qvite throughe, that vve doe not in anye ſorte hurt the membrane: becauſe therof might enſue, inflammatione, and the daūger of death.Note the forme or figure of your trepane in the ſculle. Novv to marke this, vve muſt often times lift vp the trepane, to try the thicknes of the bone, through the vvhich the trepane hath paſſed, vvhich vve muſt vvith a little privette or ſearcher try, or vvith a propre inſtrument vvhich heere to fore is onlye for this intent diſcribed. By vvhich meanes, vve muſt alſoe note, vvhether it be in noe place cleane perced, for althoughe vve rightlye &amp; aeqvallye turne the trepane, it may never the leſſe happen, that the foreſayed bone be one the one ſyde cleane througe, vnto the Dura Mater, and one other ſyde not ſoe deepe: vvhē vve therfore perceave this, vve muſte proceede vvith turninge, &amp; depreſſe the trepane one the other ſyde vvhere the bone as yet is not throughe ſomevvhat more, becauſe the bone may aeqvallye be pearced, or if it vvil not ſoe be, vve may then vvith the ſame turne of the trepane, pearce the bone one the one ſyde, &amp; denudate the Dura Mater one the other ſyde, vvhich ſomtimes I have knovvne to be done. Such an in aeqvallitye, cōmeth partlye as vvel conſideringe the heade, vvhich is rounde, as concerninge anye concavityes or furrovves vvhich are ſituated in the ſecōde table, vvhich toucheth the Dura mater, vvherfore the bone is in one place thicker then in an other.
               In like ſorte vve muſt alſoe plante the little groundedravver in the perforatione, the vvhich in the firſt vvas made vvith the poyncte of the trepane: Or vve muſt, ſtick that Elevatorium vvhich is at the poyncte of the little foreſayed grovvndedravver in that circkle, vvhich by the trepane is made, thervvith to lift out the little peece of bone, or make it looſe, by the vvhich vve ſhall eaſylye eſpye, vvhether it yet hould verye faſt, &amp; vvhether it neede anye more to be boared, &amp; if vve ſee that it hath pearced vnto the Dura mater, vve ſhall then vvith the foreſayed Elevatorium,
                  After vvhat ſorte vve ought to lifte out the perforated bone. or vvith the groundedravvere, vvholye lift it out, vvith out breakinge of it or doinge anye violence therone, becauſe ther throughe vve doe not chaunce to hurte the membranes but give it rather one turne or tvvo, becauſe that ſoe much the eaſyer vve might lift it out, at one ti-time. This beinge done and the rounde bone beinge taken therout, vve muſt then ſmoothe and make playne, the edges of the perforatione, and grate them, and take avvay all his acuitye and ruggednes, from him, for if ſoe be there remayne anye ſmall ſplinter therone or anye other vnevennes, the vvhich not beinge clenlye taken therof, it might be agreat hinderance unto the membrane: and if ſoe be that through trepaninge ther chaunced anye of the poulder of the bone to fall one the membrane, vve muſt endevour by all meanes to get it out: If ſo be it is ſufficient to remove the firſt table, vvithout touchinge of the ſeconde, vve ſhall not then playne and ſcrape the edges onlye of the pearced hole, but allſoe the vvhole bone, becauſe that therafter vvithout any trouble to the patient the ſkinne may grovve therover: for if ſoe be that it come to grovve over the rugged and vnſmooth bone it vvil be a great hinderance to the patiente, and cauſe a nue payne, becauſe that the fleſhe vvill not be ſoe goode, vvhervvhithe the rugged bone ſhal be covered.
               And this is our practiſe,Manner vve to trepane vnto the membrane. and manner of trepaninge

vnto the membrane Dura mater, and the manner allſoe hovv immediatlye to lifte the bone out of the perforatione, althoughe that Hippocrates, in his booke of the vvoundes of the heade, ſtrictlye prohibiteth to boare the hole vnto the membrane, and preſentlye to take it therout, becauſe the external ayre, ſuddaynlye alightinge one the ſame, might chaū
                  ce to hurte the ſame, by the vvhich occaſione ſhe might therafter chaūce to rotte: and more alſoe if that vve take the bone out of the ſame the vvhich as yet might be faſtened vvith the foreſayed membrane, vve might chaunce to teare the ſame, or anye ſmalle vaynes therone faſtened: or if that vve ſtucke the trepane vnto the membrane, vve might hurte the ſame: it is therfore the ſureſt vvaye, ſayeth he, that vvhē as the bone is all moſte cleane throughe, and beginneth to ſtirre, that vve then deſiſte, and tarrye vntill ſuch time as it of it ſelfe falleth out: But our trepane vvith the crovvne, or teeth is ſuch, that vnleſſe the Chyrurgiane be verye ignorant, might in anye ſorte thervvith, hurte or cruſhe dovvne the membrane.
               
                  Nue invēted trepanes.We have invēted other formes of trepanes, vvhich vve have in this booke alſo ſet dovvne ther forme vvhich vve cal Terrebellum alatū, the vvinged trepane, vvhich taketh noe peeces of bone vvith it but diminiſheth, and conſumeth them, vvhervvith by noe meanes vve may hurte the membrane: there are ſome vvhich havinge vſed them, finde them farre ſurer, and expediter in ther operationes, then thoſe vvith the hoode. But if ſoe be there be anye greate maſſacringe of bones, or depreſſinge of the ſame, thē the membrane is there throughe depreſſed and cruſhed, and is alſoe ſometimes pricked vvith the ſplinters, of the broken bone. In theſe tvvo daungerous matters, vve muſt helpe, and ſuccoure the patient or vvounded perſone one ſome other ſorte, &amp; that as ſoone as it may be poſſible, in the extractinge of the ſame, if ſo be they be vvholye ſeperated:What vve ought to doe vvhē as the Dura mater is cruſhed throughe the brokē bones or ſplinters. To vvhich purpoſe, it is oftentimes neceſſarye to trepane, &amp; cut avvay ſome parte of the ſovvnde bone, vvhich bordereth and is ſituated next vnto the plettered bones, becauſe that our Elevatorium, might in the elevating of that vvhich is depreſſed dovvnvvardes have ſufficient place, &amp; reſt it ſelfe one the ſovvnde bone, vvith out in the elevatione to depreſſe the brokene bones any more dovvnevvardes: for as Hippocrates ſayeth, the bones vvhich are broken, and depreſſede, can not vvithout greate daunger be boared or perfotated, becauſe that the depreſſinge of the trepane, or Elevatorij, by anye meanes of them can not be ſuffered. It often times happeneth that the ſeconde table is more depreſſed thē the firſt, vvherfore to that intent vve muſt let the Elevatorium paſſe throughe the perforatione of the trepane, betvveene the ſeconde table,Elevatorium is an inſtrumēt vvhervvith vve vſe to lift vp anye thinge out of a vvound. and the membrane Dura mater, becauſe in that ſort vve might lift vp the broken bones and ſplinters agayne, and take them out if they lay looſe or ſeparated. And if ſo be there vveare noe hole, &amp; above all this, the place of the fracture, could by noe meanes ſuffer, to have therin made a hole, it is as then my manner to take my grovvndedravvere vvith three feete or poynctes and ſet therone,Practiſe &amp; inventione of the aucthor. &amp; then make choyſe, of the greateſt, &amp; vvhich is moſt fitteſt for me, conſideringe the fracture vvhich is in the bone, to intrude the ſame therin, and eaſylye vvinde the ſame therin, houldinge your hande alvvayes hanginge, and not depreſſe the ſame to harde, becauſe he vvil eaſylye enough enter therin, &amp; vvhen he hath a little pearced vve muſt as then vvith a certayntye, &amp; the eaſyeſt vvay poſſible endevoure, to lift vp the broken and cruſhed peeces of bones. But if ſoe be, there be anye peece of bone ſoe farre ſhoved vnder the ſculle, that it laye above the membrane, and the ſame conſideringe his greatnes, and the anguſtnes of the apertione, coulde not by anye meanes be taken therout, ether by Elevatories, or Pincets, vve muſt thē take our refuge, (if ſo be vve vvil not through the trepane make the apertione anye bigger) to the cuttinge pincers, &amp; to the Parrates bille, vvith the vvhich vve may cutt of as much bone as vve pleaſe, vvith out anye paynes, or daunger, makinge one this ſorte the apertione ſomvvhat vvijder, to take out of the ſame the foreſayed peece of bone, vvhich driveth one the Dura mater. Touchinge the inflectione or bendinge invvardes, vvithout fracture, vvhich commonlye chaunceth in yonge children, or in theſe vvhich have a vveake &amp; tender ſculle, vvhen this is cruſhed, or bendt invvardes, as is a copper or time potte, thoſe ar better to be cured vvith extractīge plaſters, then vvith the trepane or vvith the grovvndedravvere.

And as touchinge the diſtance of the ſtitches, and ſoovvinge, vve ought not to laye them to cloſe one by the other, nether to farre ſeparate &amp; ſequeſtred one frō the other, as thē they can not retayne the vvounde: And vvhen all to nye the other they are layed, cauſe payne, through all the ſtitches, and dravvinge together of the ſame, through the vvhich payne is cauſed a concurſione of Humors vnto that place: vve muſt therfore vſe a meane therine vvell conſideringe, the largenes, and length of the vvounde: but above all vve muſt marke, that vve thruſt not, throughe or in anye ſynnues or tendones, conſideringe the payne, the Spaſmus and manye other fearfull accidentes, vvhich therof might enſue, as allreadye vve have ſayed. Sovving of a vvounde may not be effected vvith anye violence, in thoſe partes vvhich vve endevoure to vnite and bringe together, but thē is ſovvinge laudable, vvhen as the ſkinne ſtretcheth it allmoſt together, of it ovvne accorde, &amp; vvheras in this ſorte it vvill not be effected or brought to paſſe eaſylye, &amp; that the lippes of the vvound vvith violence muſt be ioyned, it is as then moſt convenient, that vve relay the ſtitches ſome diſtāce one frō the other, &amp; lettinge them be ſomvvhat looſlye ſovved: for if it chaunced vve drevve them ſomvvhat ſtiflye together, the ſkinne might then eaſylye rente or teare, &amp; ſoe burſt a ſunder throughe the tumefactione vvhich therof enſueth: If that therefore,Sovvinge may not by anye violence be done in the lippes of the vvounde. vve diſire perfectlye to cure a vvounde, vve ought as thē ſoe to diſpoſe of the ſovvinge, becauſe that in thus doinge, the humors, bloode, matter, and the externall ayre might be repelled, from the lippes, or edges of the vvoūde, becauſe ſuch thinges, may hinder, or at the leaſte deferre, the curinge of the ſame: and in ſoe much, as the lippes of the vvounde are not vvell vnited the one vvith the other, and kept in that ſtature, &amp; vnitinge, the vvound can verve badlye &amp; hardlye be cured.
               And alſoe if the lippes of the vvounde,We may in noe vviſe ſovve the lippes of an inflamed vvounde. doe greatlye chaunce to ſvvell, &amp; inflame, &amp; theye ſhrinck in themſelves, or els if they be to much bruſed or plettered, vve muſt not thē in anye ſorte reſovve it agayne: for the ſuture vvould ſtrayght vvaye breake, and ſoe conſequentlye the inflammatione increaſed, but muſt delay it ſoe longe vntill the foreſayed inflammatione be ſeaced &amp; the vvounde be come to goode ſuppuratione and matter, and is prepared and readye, to be vnited &amp; brought together.

                  WHen as the Chyrurgiane deſireth aptlye &amp; convenientlye to ſovve a vvounde, he muſt firſt of all have in his hande a needle, &amp; therto a threde, and a canulle: Cōcerninge the needle, ſhee muſt be of a reaſonable length, ſomtimes right, &amp; ſometimes croocked, accordinge as the partes reqvire, nether muſt ſhee be made of to harde a ſteele or mettle, vvher of they eaſylye might chaunce to breake, but of gentle ſteele, becauſe they might rather bende then breake: althoughe ſhee ought to be ſtiffe, ſmooth, &amp; infrangible, havīge a ſharpe triangled poyncte, becauſe that in her entringe ſhe might both cut &amp; pricke, &amp; ſoe the eaſyer perce or goe ther through, &amp; becauſe that in her govvinge throughe, ſhe might make a longe little vvound or hole, &amp; not rounde, becauſe thoſe little rovvndes, are more difficulte to be cured,What forme the needle muſt have. then the longe holes. In the heade ſhe muſt be one both ſydes hollovve, in form of a gutture, becauſe the threde might therinne be hidden &amp; buried, &amp; not hinder the percinge or entrance of the needle, in the dravvī
                  ge throughe therof, becauſe ſhee then toucheth the bodye in that ſort more eaſyer and ſofter: It vvill not alſoe hinder accordinge to the ſayīge of Avicenna, that vve ſomvvhat anoynt the needle vvith oyle, vvherbye the payne of the pricke night be ſomvvhat eaſyed, &amp; the foreſayed needle enter the eaſyer.

VVe may rather take a threde, thē ſilke, becauſe the knott of the ſilke eaſylye vnlooſeth, throughe his vveaknes: it is right true that the foreſayed threde, muſt not be to harde, becauſe there throughe he might hurt, the vvoūde, &amp; not to ſofte leaſt he breake nor chaūce to corrupte, before the time the vvounde be fullye healed, vvherthrough the lippes of the vvoūd, might agayne diſſolve &amp; vvaxe looſe yet notvvithſtā

The fore ſayed Galenus vſeth ſtringes made of ſmalle guttes, as are luteſtringes, but cōſideringe there moyſture, they quicklye beginne to ſvvell, &amp; rotte, vvherfore vve had rather vſe a ſtronge brovvne threde, vvhich vve muſt dravve throughe vvaxe &amp; vvaxe it becauſe ſoe much the leſſe he might corrupt &amp; rott, &amp; houlde the faſter. And to effect this &amp; ſurelye to ſovvea vvoūde vve muſt have a Canulle vvhich one the one end muſt be roūde, ſplitte, &amp; vvith a hole, partlye becauſe the edge or lipp of the vvoūde, vvhich vvith the needle vve vvoulde pearce, &amp; becauſe that the fore ſayed lippe may ſtay, &amp; reſt it ſelfe, on the pype, vvithout ſtirringe this vvay or that vvay, &amp; throughe the vvhole to eſpye, vvhen the needle is halfe perced throughe as then to dravve her through vvith her threde, vvithout ether the nedle, or the thred to dravve the lippes of the vvounde tovvard, them, &amp; becauſe throughe the ſplitte of the pype, it might the the eaſyer frō thence be removed, to reſt therō the other edge therafter, vvhē ſhe allſoe muſt be thruſt throughe.

had in eſteē, thre ſortes of ſovvinge of vvoundes, as naemelye, the incarnative, the bloode ſtoppinge, &amp; the conſervative ſovvinge. The incarnative ſuture is ſoe called becauſe that throughe her vnitinge, ſhee ioyneth together the ſeparated partes,Incarnative ſuture, &amp; her vſe five manner of vvayes. if ſoe be vvithout violēce &amp; cōveniētlye they may be brought together: vve vſe this māner of ſuture in all freſhe vvoū
                  des, or in theſe, vvhich are renued. And this ſovvīge is effected after five māner of vvayes. VVher of the firſt is called,Incarnative or knotted ſovvinge. the knotted ſuture or ſovvinge, becauſe that in evetye ſtitche, vvhich perceth throughe both the lippes of the vvoūd, is every time cutt of, &amp; vvith both the endes of the thred above the vvounde is knitte together: betvvixt the vvhich ſtitching, vve lay as yet other. This ſuture is done vvith a vvaxed threde, as is all readye ſayed, notinge that bothe the lippes muſt aeqvallye be ioyned the one vvith the other, vvith out that ether the one or the other, yelde it ſelfe more this vvay thē that vvay, placinge the firſte ſtich in the middle of the vvoūde, vvith a perforation of both the lippes of the vvoūd, by the vvhich the threde beinge paſſed, ſhall one the one ſyde of the lippe be dravven together, &amp; above dobblelye knitte to gether, cuttinge both endes of the threde ſhorte of, becauſe they ſhould be noe hinderāce, vnto the remydyes vvhich vve ſhall applye: The vvhich in the renuinge of the dreſſinge might be the occaſione of payne, or brekinge of the ſtitches, vvhē as vvith the plaſters vve chaunced to plucke them. If the vvoūde he greate, vve muſt as yet lay more ſtitches, in the middle of the Spaciū, &amp; one both endes of the vvounde, ſo proceedinge forvvardes vntill the vvhole vvounde be layed vvith ſtitches or ſutures, everye ſtich a fingers bredth the one frō the other, becauſe at the leaſt the lippes of the vvoūde might be brought cloſe together, conſideringe, &amp; duelye perpendinge the generall obſervatione above mētioned, &amp; eſpeciallye that the ſtitches be not layed the one to neere to the other, or the one to vvyde frō the other becauſe as heer tofore vve have ſayed, through the great multitude, and throughe ſoe many prickes, they bringe &amp; are cavſe of vehemēt payne: &amp; cōtraryly they lyinge to fare the one frō the other, the vvoūde as thē beinge not ſufficientlye occluded, or ſhutt vp, doe little profite, &amp; cōmoditye, therfore they may not be layed to cloſe by on another, nether to farre ſeparate the on frō the other, they alſoe vvhich are layed to looſelye, ſuffer the vvoūde to gape to vvyde, &amp; they vvhich to faſt, &amp; ſtrictlye dravve together the vvounde, cauſe inflammations, &amp; cōpell the vvoūde burſt open, vvherfore heerine vve ought te obſerve a mediocritye.The ſecōd incarnative ſuture.
               
               The ſeconde incarnative, or fleſhe making ſuture, is done vvith one, or vvith more needles, as if ſoe be the vvounde be greate, &amp; deep, as thē vve beginne to ſticke &amp; thruſte the needle in the lippe or edge of the vvoūde, vvithout dravvinge of the foreſayed needle qvite through, althoughe ſhee be threded, but muſt ſuffer her to continue therine, and vvinde the threde about her, in form of an S as the Taylers doe, vvhē as they are mynded ſafely to keepe there threeded needle, anye vvher one ther apparrell, as you may ſee in the figure or form of the haremouth: &amp; ſoe put as manye needles therin as ſhalbe needfull, accordinge to the greatnes of the vvounde, &amp; vvinde the threde ther about, and let them cōtinue therin vntill ſuch time as the vvoūde ſhalbe healed &amp; ioyned agayne. This ſovvinge or ſuture is vſed, in ſuch vvoundes as ſtande vvyde opē, &amp; in thoſe in the vvhich the lippes are ſeparated the one ſōvvhat vvydlye frō the other, &amp; they vvhich vvith the common ſtitchinge might not be contayned, or Kept together.
               The thirde incarnative ſovvinge, is called,The thirde incarnative ſuture. the penned ſtitchinge, becauſe moſt commō
                  lye it is done vvith little quilles, or ſhaftes of a penne, not that the foreſaved qvilles, doe effecte the ſovvinge, but becauſe they contayne it, &amp; alſoe are a lett &amp; hinderāce that the threde dothe not cut the lippes of the vvoūde cleane throughe, vvhich if vvith al expeditione &amp; vvith the leaſt payne vve deſire to make thē vve muſt doe as heerafter follovvethe. VVe ſhall firſt of all take a ſtronge double threde vvhich is ſeparated in tvvo, at the end having a knotte, vvhich vvith the needle vve muſt thruſte throughe both the lippes or edges of the vvounde, redoinge the ſame ſoe often, &amp; in divers places, as the greatnes of the vvoūde ſhall reqvire, allvvayes remēbringe that everye ſtitch muſt be a fingers bredthe the one frō the other ſituated &amp; layed, or therabout.
               This beinge in this ſort finiſhed we muſt as then one that ſyde of the vvound vvhere the knott lyeth of the threde, betvveen everye dubblethrede ſticke a little ſhaft or qville, or els a little ſtick of vvoode, vvhich is vvounde in linnen clothe, &amp; muſt be as longe in the vvounde it ſelfe: vvhich aftervvardes vvith the threde, vve muſt dravve cloſe vnto the lippe of the vvounde: and one the other lippe of the vvoūde, vve muſt through that ſame dubblethrede, in like ſorte alſoe put a qville, or a little ſticke, vvound about vvith linnē vvhich in the firſt muſt be dravvn vvith one of the foreſayed thredes, and vvith a dubble knott be knitted together, bringinge by this meanes the lippes of the vvounde as cloſe together as is poſſible, in this vvyſe proceedinge vvith dravvinge together and knittinge, all the thredes vvhich ther are, in ſuch ſorte as the firſt vvas dravven together &amp; knitte. Such ſovvinge, is vſed, in greate, &amp; deepe vvoūdes

in the vvhich vve feare leaſt the cōmon ſovvinge or ſtitchinge might chaunce to breake, &amp; cut through the edges of the vvounde.
               The fourth is called the drye ſtich, or ſovvinge,The fourth incarnative ſuture. becauſe this may be done vvithout pearcinge of the ſkinne or fleſhe: vvhich vve are vvonte to doe vvith tvvo ſtrōge peeces of linnen cloth, vvhich are cut of the ſyde or edge of the clothe, and vvhich in the endes are cut ſharpe or picked, as heere before in the figure vve may ſee, on the vvhich other ende vve muſt ſpreade a verye dravvīge &amp; faſt houldinge playſter, vvhich qvicklye may be dryed, vvhich muſt thus be praepared, vve ſhall applye this ſame one both ſydes of the vvound, a little higher then the foreſayed vvounde, &amp; in ſuch ſort that bothe the ſharpe endes of the peeces of cloth, may be ſituated cloſe vnto the edges of the vvounde. This beinge cleaved verye faſt to the ſkinne, vve muſt as then ſovve bothe ther endes cloſe together, vvithout touchinge of the ſkinne, and dravve them together vvith the threde, through the vvhich meanes, vve may compacte the lippes of the vvounde as cloſe together, os vve pleaſe. Such a māner of ſtitchinge is very vvillingelye vſed in the vvoundes of the face vvhēas vve deſire to have noe great cicatrice left therin.
               
                  The fith kind of ſovvinge is noe more in vſe.The fifth incarnative ſovvinge or ſtitchinge, is effected vvith iron hoockes, vvhich one both there endes vveare crooked, vvith the vvhich vve muſt hould both the lippes of the vvounde, bringinge the foreſayed lippes cloſe together: but becauſe they cōtinuallye pricke &amp; are never vvithout cauſing of payne, &amp; moreover might chaunce to ſticke in anye membrane, vvhich might ſuſcitate &amp; cauſe payne, concurringe of humors, &amp; inflammatione, in the vvoūded parte, it is novve a dayes noe more in vſe.The ſecō
                     de generall ſuture The ſeconde ſuture is, the bloode-ſtoppinge ſuture, ſoe called, becauſe ſhe ſtencheth &amp; ſtoppeth bloode, and hindereth that the ayre can not enter into the vvoūde, vvhen as in manner of revolutione vve turne the needle, (as the furriers are vvōte to doe, vvhen as they ſovve together the ſkinnes, &amp; lay the ſtiches, reaſonable cloſe, harde, &amp; on by the other. Some vſe this ſuture, or ſtitchinge, vvhē as the great vaynes or arteryes, are hurt or cutt of, cōſideringe the great ſheddinge of bloode, through the vvhich they are compelled to doe ſoe, &amp; ſoe the more eaſyer to ioyne &amp; bringe together and ſhutt the lippes of the vvounde.
               But this ſtitchinge, is nothinge to certayne, becauſe the one ſtitchbrekinghe, all the other breake &amp; goe looſe, moreover the bloode vvhich is therin cōtayned cauſeth that part to ſvvell, and leeſeth as it vveare himſelfe betvveen the muſcles, vvhich alſoe therafter by cōtinuance of time corrupt &amp; are mortifyed. VVherfor I vvoulde councell the yonge Chirurgiane, that he ſhould rather tye or binde the mouth of the vayne or arterye, or vvith a Cauterium cauterize it together, thē to vſe ſuch a ſtitchinge, vvhich is farre cōvenienter, in the vvoundes of the ſmall guttes, or entralles, of the blather, or in the vvoūdes of the ſtomacke to be effected, if at the leaſt in the tvvo laſt it may anye vvay poſſible be brought to paſſe.
               The thirde ſovvinge,The thirde Stitchinge. or ſtitchinge vve call the conſervative, or the praeſervinge ſuture, becauſe ſhe praeſerveth, &amp; Keepeth, the lippes op the vvounde vvhich are verye vvyde ſeparated the one frome the other, or els becauſe they are plettered, &amp; cruſhede, or els becauſe ther is anye parte of them loſt, throughe the vvhich they cā not by any meanes be brought &amp; ioyned agayne, the one vvith the other, reqviringe onlye to be defēded, &amp; mayntayned in that eſtate, till ſuch time as the vvounde be come to a goode ſuppuratione &amp; incarnatione: vvher through the vvoūde, is ſoe much the the ſooner cured &amp; cicatriſed, vvithout anye greate, or deformed cicatrice, remayninge in the place. This ſtitchinge is alſoe vſed vvhen vve ſuſpecte, that ther is anye thinge cōtrarye to nature in the vvoūde, vvhich vve vvillinglye vvould have therout , vvherfore vve doe not bringe the lippes of the vvounde ſo cloſe together, as in other ſutures, contentinge our ſelves, that in ſuch ſorte vve may continue it.
               Touchinge the time, vvhē vve ought to cut a ſunder the ſtitchinges, ther is noe certayntye therof, becauſe in ſome bodyes, the vvoūdes are ſooner cured, then in others, alſoe the one parte healeth ſooner then the other, vvherfore vve ought not to cutt looſe the ſtitches, before the vvounde be ſoe far come, that ſhe hath noe more neede of the ſtitches, vvhich cuttinge, muſt alſoe be done one divers manners, as the ſtitchinges are divers: for the knotted ſtitchinge, muſt be done, by cuttinge everye ſtitche aparte, right at the knott, liftinge vp the threde vvith the privette or ſearchinge iron, havinge in this ſorte cut of the knott of everye ſtitche, vve ſhall as then vvith the pincet or pinſinge iron dravve them out by there knot layinge the one finger one the ſtitch, to hould that faſt that the one lippe of the vvoū

avvay, vvhen as ether vvith vvater or vvith anye oyle vve moyſten the ſame.The furriers faſhoned ſuture. And the ſuture of the furriers faſhone, is verye difficulte to be taken avvaye: in this ſtitchinge, vve muſt firſt of all beginne to cutt, the firſt ſtiche, and ſoe proceedinge forevvardes, vvith the ſciſſors, or ſheares, vnto the end, if at the leaſt it be to be done, and then eaſylye and gentlelye take every ſtitch out apart, allvvayes houldinge faſt the lippes of the vvoundes vvith pour finger, leaſt that they in anye ſorte lift vp them ſelves becauſe if it ſoe chaūced vve coulde not eaſylye reſovve them agayne.

                  The ſmall guttes beinge hurte, &amp; cleane cut a ſunder, can not by anye meanes becured.VVhen as therfore it chaunceth, that the guttes are ſuncke out of the bellye, vve muſt then firſt of all dillygentlye conſider, vvhether in noe place they are vvounded, or hurte, ſecondly, vvhether as yet they retayne the naturall coloure, for if ſoe be the ſmall guttes are cleane cutt of, &amp; eſpeciallye that emptye one, vvhich vve call Ieiunum, it is then impoſſible that he may be healed agayne, becauſe of a great companye, and divers greate vaynes, vvhich are therin, allſoe conſideringe his ſubtyle and ſynuiſhe tunicle or koate, and becauſe he continuallye receaveth the Cholera, and is ſituated more neerer the liver, then anye other. But the great guttes beinge hurte, vve may rightvvell ſovve them, yet not vvithout a ſtedfaſt hope that vve are able to cure them, althoughe in reſpecte of the ſmalle guttes, by the great ones, vvhich are hurte, it is allvvayes better to have a doubtfull confidence then a certayne diſpayre, as much as belongeth vnto ther curinge. If ſoe be anye of thē be blacke, or pale, (vvhich is a certayne ſigne they have loſt ther feelinge) there is nothinge to be done vnto them, or at the leaſt verye little. But if ſoe be as yet they retayne the vitalle coloure, vve muſt by all meanes endevoure to bringe them in agayne, and that vvith all poſſible expeditione, becauſe the externall ayre, in the vvhich they are not vvōte to be, doth ſtraight vvayes change and ſpoyle thē. And firſt of all if they be vvounded, vve muſt ſtitch thē vvith the furriers ſuture, vvhich above vve have diſcribed, &amp; vvhē they are ſovved, bringe them into there naturall place or ſituatiō, dilligentlye notinge that vve doe not let the end of the threde hange in the vvoūde, becauſe vvhen as they are cured, vve may dravve the threde ther out, &amp; not let it ſincke into the bellye, for the vvhich occaſione he ought be reaſonable longe, vvithout cuttīge of him from the ſovvīge.

VVhen as an Apoſtematione, muſt needes be brought to ſuppuratione of matter &amp; can by noe meanes poſſible be conſumed or reſolved, the ſignes therof are theſe, namelye a burninge heate, erectīge of the tumefactione, or ſvvellinge, more rednes,Signes of ſuppuratione. &amp; vvhich is alſo harder thē before, prickinge, knockinge, or beatinge payne, ponderouſnes, as if there did hange anye heavye thinge at that ioynte: And if ſoe be this apoſtematione be ſituated in any principall parte, then there is a chillnes and ſhiveringe thervvith aſſociated, the ague allſoe is more violent by day, then by night: ſometimes alſoe the next kernells vvhich are in the bodye ſituated thervnto come or chaunce to ſvvel, &amp; be diſtempered.Signes vvhē the matter is fullye ripened▪

               It happeneth alſoe ſometimes, that although the apoſtematione be not yet ripe,What apoſtematiōs vvilbe opened before there cō

The fitteſt time therfore firſt of all to doe an operatione, is in the morninge by time, cōſidering that in ſuch a time, the perſone is farre better qvieted &amp; better animated and incouraged, except the greate daunger reqvired othervvyſe the cōtrarye Secondly vve muſt note, that the apertion be made in a conveniēt place, vvhich cōveniēt place, is knovven by the tumefactione,Secondly of the parte, in the vvhich there revealeth it ſelfe a little heade, &amp; ther is greate vveakenes &amp; ſoftenes founde therin, vvhich glideth vnder the feelinge of the finger, &amp; vvhere the ſkinne is thinneſte: it is right true that ſuch an apertiō might bedone in the inferior partes of the tumefactione a foreſayed, becauſe the matter might the eaſyer iſſue out,Four principalle cō

               The third conditione is, that vve muſt conſider, one the rimpelinge of the ſkinne,The third cōditione &amp; one the fibres of the muſcles, and becauſe the muſcles allmoſt runne throughe the length of the bodye, the apertione muſt thē be made in the length of the bodye, and accordinge vnto the right concurringe of the muſcles. Notvvithſtandinge althoughe, the rimples, or forefrōte of the heade lye thvvarte over, yet the inſciſiō muſt therin be made accordinge vnto the lēgthe, follovvīge the fleſhye fibers, of the broad muſcle: othervvyſe the ſkinne beinge cutt accordinge to the rūninge of the rimples, might chaunce to fall on the eyes, In the heade vve muſt obſerve the grovvinge of the hayre.

As alſoe vve muſt conſider, on the depthe, &amp; marke that vve thruſt not the lancet to deepe therin, but reaſonable deepe: for vvhē as vve thruſt to deepe, it is thē great dolour, &amp; payne to the patiēt, &amp; cauſeth alſoe much bleedinge: &amp; thruſtinge not deepe enoughe, vve effecte &amp; brīge nothīge to paſſe.
               The fifth cōditione, muſt be obſervede, accordinge to the apertiō of all greate apoſtematiōs, that at one time vve ſuffer not all the matter to rūne out, but rather by little, &amp; little, eſpeciallye, the patient beinge debile, oulde, yonge, or any vvomā vvith child, becauſe all ſuddayn evacuatiōs, doe cauſe great imbicillity &amp; fayntnes becauſe ther through the vitall ſpirites, evaporate &amp; flye avvay, vvhich in the cōcavitye of the Apoſtemation vvith the matter vveare ſhutt therin, althoughe they are agaynſte nature.

This beinge done, vve muſt then dreſſe that parte, &amp; vvinde it beginninge to vvinde from the ſovvnde parte, vnto the bottome of the cōcavitye if there be anye, endinge at the apertione becauſe the matter may be preſſed &amp; cruſhed therout, vvithout beinge therin retayned, any longer, becauſe by to longe tarryinge therine, it doe not cauſe a greate hollovve fiſtulous concavitye to come therin: then vve muſt lay that part in ſuch a ſort that the apertione may depend or hange, becauſe ſoe the matter may the better iſſue out therat.
            
            
               Of the tumefactions, or ſwellinges called, Ateromata, Steatomata, and Melicerides. Chap. 2.
               
                  THe auncient profeſſors,The difference of theſe thre Vlcerationes. have allvvayes noted, onlye the ſpecies &amp; formes of vlcerations, that they onlye differed the one from the other, in the matter, vvhich is founde therine. For in the vlceration Ateroma,
                  Signes to knovve them. is a kinde of matter like vnto thinne pappe: the vlceration Steatoma, a kinde of fatte matter, like ſuet. In Melicerides, is a matter like vnto honnye: Soe that by the forme of coniecture vve may ſay, vvhat matter therin lyeth incloſed, but for a certayntye vve can not ſay it, before ſuch time as vve have fetched ſome of the matter therout: and one this manner they are allvvayes knovvne the one frō the other. vvhen as vve chaūce to touch the vlceratiō 
                  Ateroma, it ſpreadeth abroade, in that place vvherō vve chaū
                  ce to depreſſe it, &amp; doth not ſo ſuddaynly, ioyne it ſelfe together. The vlceration Meliceres, differeth frō the Ateroma, in his forme, &amp; ſubſtāce of his humors for his figure is much roū
                  der, and the ſubſtance of the humor vvhich is therin, farre ſubtiler. ſoe that it ſpreadeth more abroade, then the Ateroma, vvhen vvith the finger vve depreſſe it, it ſeparateth it ſelfe farre ſoener, &amp; alſoe ioyneth much ſooner, vvhē vve take the fingers therof. The vlceratione

                  Steatoma, is much harder, then both the other, &amp; in the touchinge of it, it ſtirreth not, but reſiſteth the depreſſinge of the fingers, &amp; commōlye in the bottome is it ſomvvhat broade, and verye ſeldome or never may vve ſe any vvhich are vnder narrovve &amp; broade above.
               
                  We oftentimes finde harde matter in theſe vlcerations.Theſe foreſayed vlcerations, are in ther beginninge allvvay little, but in continuance of time, they grovv to be greater, ſome are verye harde, &amp; vve finde ſometimes therin vvondrous matter, as if it vveare little ſtones, bones, rovvled hayre, mixed vvith any matter vvhich is thicke.
               
                  The matter lyeth encloſed in a little blather.
                  Philexomus ſayeth, he ſometimes hath fovvnde, in the matter vvhich therin lay incloſed, little creatures, as if it had bīne gnattes, vve muſt note that al thoſe foreſayed humors, &amp; al theſe vvonderfull thinges, are incloſed as it vveare in little blathers.
               But as much as concernethe the apertione of the ſame, it hindereth nothinge vvhether the matter be like pappe, or like honnye, or like ſuet, or vvhat matter ſoever it might be: for vve have but one onlye intentione, to vvitt that vve extracte &amp; dravve out the blather, or little bagge, vvherin the matter is incloſed, for the manner hovve to open it is this.
               
                  The operatione to cure the vlceratiōs is nothing different.VVe muſt firſt of all lift vp the ſkinne frō the bottome, &amp; then cutt it of, makinge inſciſione accordinge to the greatenes of the vlceratione, dilligētlye markinge leaſt vve cut the blather or purſe vvherin the the humor is incloſed, becauſe the matter doe not chaunce to iſſue out: For the matter beinge iſſued, the vvhole remanēt operatiō is perturbed, &amp; annihilated, becauſe alſoe there by the operatiō falleth flatte dovvne: ſoe that as then vve may or can verye difficultlye flea, peele or ſeparate the foreſayed membrane of the matter, from the fleſhe, vvherthroughe the vvhole curatione, conſiſteth vvithout reciduitye.
               VVhen as in this ſorte, vve ſhall have cutt the ſkinne, thē the little bagge demonſtrateth it ſelfe vvhyte, and outſtretched, vvhich vvith greate dilligence, vve muſt endevoure to ſeparate thereof, vvith a Spatula, to vvitt, from the ſkinne, &amp; out of the fleſhe, or vvith any other inſtrument, vvhich is thereto ſerviceable, vvher vvith vve muſt take it out, vvith all that vvhich is therin, vvithout ſufferinge anye iott therof to remayne in the bottome, becauſe it chaunce not to increaſe agayne: And iſ it ſoe happened that there chaunced to tarrye anye thinge therof in the vvounde, vve muſt not as thē heale together the apertione verye ſoone, but vvith puryfyinge medicamentes, purifye that therout vvhich as yet remayneth therin.
               
                  We muſt in the operatione dilligentlye conſider, that vve doe not chaū
                     ce to breake anye Vaynes, ſynnues, arteryes, or tendones.VVe muſt alſoe heer note, that ſome of theſe vlcerations, are rotede betvveene anye vaynes, arteryes, ſynnues, &amp; tēdones, vvhich eradication, reqvireth a greate &amp; longe cōtinued &amp; convenient manuall, operation, becauſe, thinckinge qvite and cleane to take avvay the little bagge or purſe from thence, vve might chaunce to burſt anye vayne, arterye, ſynnue or Tēdone, therfore if ſo be therebe anye parte therone faſtened it is then bētter to deſiſte from our operation. VVhē this operatione is thus finiſhed, in anye ſmalle ſvvellinges, ther is as thē noe more daunger, vvherfore there reſteth no thinge for vs to doe, then vvith any curinge medicamentes, to heale op the inſciſione, layinge therone a Compreſſe, madefied in ſome defenſive or other, becauſe that in the dreſſinge, all inflāmations may be praevented, &amp; the ſeparated partes the on agayne conioyned vvith the other. But if ſoe be the vvounde vveare great, &amp; coulde not be cured, one this manner, it vvill not then ſeeme diſcommodious, that vve ſtitch it vp, layinge the ſtitches ſomvvhat vvyde the one from the other, to let anye medicamemt or other droppe betvveen them, &amp; to give paſſage to the matter vvhich engendreth therin: &amp; then vve muſt vvholye cure theſe vlceratiōs as all other vlcerations.
               Touchinge the curing of Queēs evil vvhich is alſoe done through manuall operatione, is alſoe one this māner effected, takinge the foreſayed Queens evill vvholye therout, if ſoe be it be poſſible dilligentlye markinge, that vve chaūce not to hurte anye vaynes ſituated ther about, &amp; eſpeciallye of thoſe vvhich are divided amongſt the muſcles, vvhich are ſerviceable to the ſpeach, or voyce, as are the recurrentes, or retrogradinge muſcles, &amp; thoſe vvhich are ſituated, abute the Laringa as vvell the principalls as commō: For it hath oftē times happened that ſome have had this diſſeaſe of the Qveenes evill cut out about ther throt, vvhich all there life time therafter have remayned hoarce &amp; vvithout ſpeeche.

                  SOme men there are, vvhich have a certayne excreſcēce, of fleſhe in the noſtrells, vvhich reſumeth her originalle, out of the bone, Etmoidis, or Chribleus, &amp; out of the bones of the noſe. This excreſcence happeneth or commeth to a man, by little &amp; little at once, and at the laſt, ſhe vvaxeth ſoe bigge, &amp; huge in qvā
                  titye, that ſhe ſtoppeth the vvhole noſtrells, &amp; ſometimes alſoe hangeth dovvne to the lippes, by the vvhich the patient, is mervelouſlye moleſted, as vvell in ſpeakinge, as breathinge. Sometimes alſo ſhee grovveth in the entrāce, or conductione, through the vvhich the ayer, &amp; the breath, are dravvne into the throte, the vvhich vve may eaſilye ſee, vvhen as the patiēt openeth his mouthe, behinde the pallaet of the mouth, &amp; in ſuch a greatnes ſomtimes, that ſhe ſtoppeth the throate, vvherthroughe the patient cōmeth in the end to be chōaked, if that in time vve doe not prevent it, And becauſe ſuch an excreſcēce of fleſhe, moſt commonlye is ſofte, and pale, havinge divers ſmall ſproutes, not miſlike vnto the feet, of the fiſhe Purpura, it is therfore of the Greeckes called Polipus, &amp; allſo in our langvage Polipus.
               
               There are noe ſortes of Polipus vvhich being venoumous,Noe ſortes of Polipus, can throughe Chyrurgery be cured. have neede of the operatione of Chyrurgerye, becauſe vve may not touch thē, in like ſorte vve may not touch thoſe vvhich are infected vvith the Cancer, becauſe ther nature

                  Hovve vve ought to cure the Polipum.To the effectuatinge of vvhich, the aunciē
                  te Chyrurgiās, &amp; thoſe vvhich have follovved there doctrine, have effected this operatione cruellye enoughe: for ſome there are vvhich vvith an inſtrument cutt rovvnde, or circkle vvyſe this Polipum, vvhich to that end &amp; purpoſe, therto they have cauſed to be made, and is called in greeke Polyticon Pathion, vvithout touchinge of the cartilage, or griſle, vvhich beinge effected, they dravve forthe the foreſayed deſcided Polipus, vvith an inſtrument much like vnto an eare picker, or els vvith ſome kinde of hoocke, &amp; then they cure &amp; heal the vlceratiō, as it reqvireth to be don. And as cōmonly there remayneth ſome little peece of roote, in the bones Etmoides, &amp; of the noſe, the vvhich they ſcrape of, alſoe from the foreſayed bones turninge, &amp; thruſtīge therin, vvith an inſtrumēt, to fetche all therout, that by any meanes poſſible might tarrye, and remayne therein.

Others ther are, vvhich vvith an actuall cauterye, cauterize it, vvhich throughe a pipe they thruſt therin. Others, after the exāple the four famous Chyrurgians,An other manner to cure the Polipum. vvhich not beinge of opinion, that in noe vvyſe, or in anye ſorte vve vveare able to cauterize the Polipus, vnto his roote, becauſe he is ſoe deepe ingraffed, they thē make an inſciſione, one the one ſyde, of the cartilage of the noſe, vnto the bone of the ſame, &amp; havinge in this ſort diſcovered, &amp; denudatede the Polipū
                   vnto his roote or firſt ofſpringe, &amp; originalle, then they there cutt, &amp; cauteriſe him, &amp; ſtitch together agayne the ſayed inſciſione, as vve are commonlye vſed to doe in the hare mouthes. The vviſe, &amp; Learned man Guido de Cauliaco, liketh &amp; commendeth this, or ſuch like operatione, but in noe vviſe, counceleth, to ſtitch vp the inſciſion, before the foreſayed Polipus, be vvholy eradicated, &amp; rooted out, becauſe if ſoe be, that anye parcell therof remayne, it agayne increaſeth, vvhich happening he, to be ſoe, all the trouble, &amp; paynes of the patient, hath binne done for nothinge, &amp; to noe purpoſe. All vvhich operations, beinge as ſufficiently and completlye effected as they poſſible may be, yet for the patiēt they are tedious &amp; trouble ſome, as often times, vve have vvith our eyes behelde, vvhich to ſpeake the very truthe indeede, they have never attayned vnto ther perfecte, and former health agayne, but rather farre vvorſe, then better: vvherby vve vveare moved, to trye. &amp; make experiment of a far more ominous, and more convenient operatiō, to the curinge of this diſſeaſe, vvhich conſiſtethe in the vvhole eradicatione of the ſame.The manner hovve to drovve out the Polipus, more certayner, &amp; convenienter, through extirpatione. To the vvhich end and purpoſe it ſeemeth vnto vs convenient, that vve ſituate, &amp; diſpoſe the patient, on the moſt convenient māner vve may, in a ſeate, tovvardes the light, &amp; the Chyrurgian, vvith his left hande openinge the noſtrell, vvherin the Polipus is ſituated, ſhall vvith his right hande, thruſt therin the flat tōges, as deepe as poſſibly he may, (vvhich tonges muſt be ſōvvhat broade, &amp; like a Duckes) bil vvhervvith he muſt nipe the foreſayed Polipū, &amp; gentlelye vvith both his handes turne &amp; vvinde the ſame, &amp; thervvith alſoe dravve tovvardes him a little, &amp; not at one plucke, becauſe the roote vvhich is faſt ſetled in the foreſayed bones, might alſoe follovve, &amp; the foreſayed Polipus at one time be dravven forthe, and extirpated: vvhich I my ſelfe may vvith the truthe alleadge to have done, vvith verye little payne. Mr. Sourlin, a verye experte Chyrurgian, hath aſſured me, that he alſoe divers times hath done it one the ſame manner, vvithout anye inconvenience.Admonitione for the Chyrurgiane. But the Chyrurgyane muſt conſider, that he doe not advē

And ſoe farre forth as the foreſayed Polipus, drevve himſelfe vpvvardes, avoydinge the nipinge, of the little tōges, vve muſt thē dravve it dovvnevvardes, vvith a little hooke, becauſe as then vve may the better, take houlde therone: the operatiō beinge finiſhed, ther enſueth an effluxiō of bloode preſētlye, therafter, vvhich vve ſhall permitte, &amp; ſuffer to bleed, becauſe that parte may be therof releaſed, &amp; vnburthened: vve muſt then cauſe the patiēt, through his noſe to ſnufle vp redd

It is impoſſible, that vve ſhould ingendre, anye other matter, &amp; reſtore, the ſubſtāce, vvhich therin is vvantinge, becauſe it is the vvorke of nature &amp; not of the Chyrurgiane: but he may bringe the ſeparated partes the one, by the other, and cauſe ſuch a ſubſtāce, vvhich in that parte is deficiēt, &amp; vvantinge ſhall ſeeme as it vveare there in ingendred, ſoe that verye hardlye vve ſhall eſpye, &amp; marke ſuch an vnſeemlines, &amp; deformitye, eſpeciallye if the ſlitte have binne but ſmall: for theſe diſſeaſes might per adventure be ſoe greate, that they ſhoulde be incurable, and vveare not conveniente for vs to lay handes one them, &amp; if ſoe be vve endevoured to cure them, vve might chaunce to make them farre vvorſe, &amp; more vnſeemlye, then before they vveare. VVherfore the Chyrurgiane ought dilligentlye to conſider, that one ſuch kindes of fiſſures or ſplittinges, he impoſe not his handes, and eſpeciallye in thoſe vvhich are to vvyde ſeperated the one from the other, &amp; vvhere there is to much ſubſtāce deficient or vvantinge, betvveene them bothe, for vvhen a Chyrurgian endevoureth to cure ſuch a diſſeaſe, then muſt neceſſarylye the ſeiunged and ſeparated partes, ether ioyn, &amp; heale together agayn, or els not: if ſoe be they grovve, &amp; ioyn together, the lippe thē is merveylouſlye ſtretched, &amp; lyeth cloſe to the teethe, &amp; one the gū

                  In vvhat perſons this operatione is daungerous.This manuale operatione, is verye daungerous in aged perſons, &amp; in thoſe vvhich are vnhealtheſame, of bodye, or in thoſe, vvhich (as vve commonlye ſay) have noughtye healinge fleſhe, becauſe, that in mās bodye there is noe parte or place, vvhere in the Cācker cā ſooner come, and beinge therin, vvherin he may be vvorſe cured, &amp; vvith more difficulty healed. The meanes to cure ſuch a diſſeaſe, is on this manner: VVhe muſt firſt of all ſituate the patiēt tovvardes the light, &amp; vvith our left hāde, lift vp the right ſyde of the cloven or ſplitted lippe, &amp; as then cut vvith the crooked lancett, in the middle or vpper end of the foreſayed ſyde of the lippe, through the ſkinne, &amp; alſoe betvveene them both beginninge as highe, &amp; as neere the noſe, as poſſible might be done, dravvīge the foreſayed lācett, vnto or tovvardes beneath or end of the lippe,Hovv vve ought to cure the cloven lippes, or haremouthes. becauſe that the vvhole interiacēt ſkinne, might be cleane therof ſeparated and ſevered: then vve muſt change handes, takinge in our right hāde, the other ſyde of the clovē lippe, vvhich is ſituated in the left ſyde, &amp; then vve muſt cut vvith the left hande, even as before vve have done vvith the right, becauſe the clovē lippe, may on all ſydes be cut, &amp; on the edges be brought to ravv fleſhe, vvithout leavinge the leaſt parte thereof vntouched, vvhich is not cut, or made ravv, ether in the infierior, or ſuperior partes therof, &amp; that nothinge differinge from a greene, freſhe, &amp; bloodye vvoūde, before vve aſſay to ſtitch them the one vvith the other.We muſt let that parte ſomvvhat bleede.

If ſoe be the ſeparated partes, of the foreſayed lippe, can not vvith any facilitye, or eaſe be brought together, vve muſt thē make tvvo inſciſions, in eache ſyde of the lipp one, informe &amp; likenes of a halfemoone, both the korners therof tovvardes the vvoūd,Vievve the figure before. as heer befor in the figure vve may ſee, vvhich inſciſiones muſt onlye penetrate the vpper ſkinne, becauſe that the edges of the vvounde beinge dravvne together, might the better ioyne the one vvith the other, for vvith anye violence they may not be compelled, but rather, vvith gentlenes, and vvithout any force, becauſe that, they beinge brought and ioyned the one vvith the other, be not agayne vvithdravvne backvvardes.

                  THe tunge in ſome perſons, or children, is ſhorter then ſhee ought to be, vvhervvith they are borne, and by the vvhich occaſiō, they muſt vvith difficulty vtter the vvordes vvhich they vvoulde ſpeake, the tunge beinge intercepted, and hindred, by a certayne ligament, vvhich vve call the ſpāned vayn, vvherthroughe the tōge, is reſtrayned, &amp; as it vveare, ſeemeth to be brydeled, or throughe any membrane thervnder ſituated, vvheron the tunge reſteth, &amp; becauſe ſhee can not ſoe move her ſelfe, and turne, as it vveare convenient, ſhee ſhoulde.

               Novv to cure this diſſeaſe, vve muſt firſt of all make an apertione, vvith the crooked lancet, accordinge to the length of that parte and not thvvart or croſſeover, to give iſſue &amp; paſſage to the humiditye &amp; matter to runne out, vvhich is the occaſione of this tumefactione, or vlceratione: and if ſoe be this ſvvelling returne, the ſureſt remedye, as thē is the actuall cauterye.

This apertion beinge on ſuch a manner effected, &amp; brought to paſſe, vve muſt cauſe the patient to vvaſh his mouthe, vvith a mouth-vvater, or gargriſe, vvhich muſt be made of barley-vvater, of Plantine, and of honie-vvater.

This reſervinge his naturall proportione, the Greeckes as thē call it Gargareon, the Latiniſtes, Gurgulio,

               That vvhich is blacke,Wen vve ought not to cutt avvay the pallate. vve muſt not in anye vvyſe meddle vvith, or take in handes, in like ſorte alſoe the ſame being vvholye inflamed, becauſe as then vvith out daunger vve can by noe meanes poſſible, deſcide and cutt it of, becauſe of the ſuperfluous bleedinge vvhich conſeqventlye follovveth, vvherfore as then vve ought rather to vſe all ſuch medicamentes as ſtill, and aſſvvage payne, vvhich moyſten and madefye, and gentlye fortifye &amp; ſtrenghthen the patiēt.

               This diſſeaſe may be cured, by takinge avvay

that, vvhich in the pallate is oppugnant vnto nature, ether throughe diſſectione, or throughe cauterizinge, or els throughe bindinge of the ſame. If ſoe be vve feare anye ſuperfluous bleedinge, it is then the ſureſt, ſhorteſt, &amp; eaſieſt vvaye, to diſcide it, becauſe the patiēt ther throughe might be freede from manye more miſeries, calamityes, &amp; miſchaūces, vvherine othervvyſe he might in time chaunce to fall as is the cough, through the cōtinuallirritatiō of the forefayed longe hangīge pallate, omiſſione, &amp; loſſe, of ſleepe, &amp; ſomtimes alſoe the choackinge, ſoe that vve notinge &amp; obſervinge all theſe thinges, are of tē times compelled, for the ſuccoure of the patient, to effect our extreame,The firſt vvay to cure the ſinckinge of the pallate. and laſte remedye, to preſerve and keepe him from greater daunger enſvinge.
               And aptlye to bringe this to paſſe, vve muſt cauſe the patient to ſit in a verye lucent and lightſome place, and alſoe to ſet apert &amp; vvide open his mouth, and depreſſe his tunge vvith the Speculum oris, then take houlde one the foreſayed pallate, vvith a litte inſtrument, or tō

Touchinge the potentiall cauterye, or corroſive, vve muſt firſt receave, into the apertiō or vvindovve of the foreſayed pipe, that parte of the pallate, vvhich vve deſire to corroſive, and then vvith a privett or ſearchīge irō thruſt into the foreſayed pipe, a peece of corroſive, aganſt the foreſayed peece of pallate of the mouth, and continue the ſame therone a certayne time, dilligentlye conſideringe, that not anye parte of the corroſive, fall one the tunge, or the throte, vvhen as throughe the humiditye of the pallate it beginneth to liqvefye.This corroſive is diſcribed before amonge the inſtrumentes. And vvhē vve deſire to take avvay the foreſayed pipe, vve muſt thē firſt of all lay the Speculum oris, one the tunge, becauſe as thē noe parte of the foreſayed corroſive, chaunce to light or fall one any of the ſubteriacēt partes, nether touch any parte, but the pallate onlye becauſe therby they might be indammaged, and hurte. Thus havinge brought this to paſſe, vve muſt annoynt the pallate vvith a little oyle of roſes, vvith a little cotten or linnen there in beinge madefied, and made fatt, then ſhall the patient vvaſhe his mouth vvith a little rooſevvater.
               A ſorte ther are vvhich doe not vſe the foreſayed pipe, but they dippe, &amp; moyſten, a little cotten, or linnen, vvhich is tyed to the privet, or ſearchinge iron, in oyle of vitriol, or Aquafortis, vvith the vvhich they touche the pallate, and cauterize it, the tunge before beinge layed dovvne vvith the Speculo oris, &amp; thē a little ſeaſon follovvinge they vvaſhe it vvith Plātinevvater.

VVhen as therfore, throughe the applicatione of anye of the fore ſayed corroſives, or cauteryes, the place of the pallate beginneth to be blacke, it is then a ſigne that it is ſufficiētlye cauteriſed, and if ſoe be the coloure therof be not, as yet chaunged, vve muſt then yet once agayne applye the corroſive thervnto, &amp; then cauſe the patient to gargriſe his mouth vvith Oxicrate or vvith vvarme redd vvyne.

VVe are ſometimes cōſtrayned to opē this vlceratione, before it be fullye mature, and ripe, to vnburthen, and releaſe that parte therof, becauſe the bloode vvhich iſſueth out of the foreſayed vlceratione, diminiſheth &amp; intercepteth the payne, and inflammatione therof, admineſtreth better paſſage vnto the meate, and drincke, and finallye, prolō

               If ſoe be theſe ſayed Almōdes, are groovvē ſoe longe &amp; harde, vvith out anye hope to reduce them agayne to ther former &amp; naturall eſtate, &amp; beinge, vve muſt as then vſe the manuall of Chyrurgerye thervnto, ether by cuttinge of the ſame, or els throughe inſciſione: if ſoe be there be nothinge to hinder or be a let heere vnto, then the ligature vveare moſt convenient thervnto, and eſpeciallye, vvhē as vve feare anye ſuperfluous bleedīge. VVhich verye conveniētlye may be done,Ligature, or inſciſion in the almōdes, vvhē they are grovven to longe &amp; harde. vvith an inſtrument, one the ſame forme and faſhon, as before vve have rehearſed, in the tyinge of the pallate, ever obſervinge, that vve cutt therof noe more, then is needfull, contentinge our ſelves thervvith, not to cut therof anye more, then that vvhich ſurpaſſeth his naturall magnitude, &amp; greatnes: becauſe that throughe the largenes and romthe of the throte vvhich by this diſſectione might chaūce, there be not irritated and occaſioned to follovve, all ſuch accidentes and inconveniēces, as before vve have diſcribed, of the pallate vvhich is to ſhorte cut of, or anye daungerouſe bleedinge, if ſoe vve deſcide and cutt it of vnto the naturall, &amp; ſovvnde fleſhe, of the forerehearſed almondes, becauſe of the greate vaynes vvhich there vnder lye diſpearſed.
               But before vve proceede unto this operatione, vve muſt conſider,The canckerouſe almondes may not be tyed, not cut of. vvhether they be not of ſome canckerouſe nature, becauſe thoſe vvhich are canckerouſe may not by the manualle, operation of Chyrurgerye be cured: they are moſt eaſyeſt knovvne, vvhen as they are harde, of a purple coloure, rugged, full of payne, and have a great roote. But if they be pale rovvnde, tender, ſmoothe, and belovve thinne, vve may as then vvithout daūger tye, and cutt them of. And in as much as concerneth this operatione,Hiſtorye of Albucaſis. the hiſtorye of Albucaſis ſhall at this time ſuffice, to inſtructe the yonger Chyrurgian, to imitate the ſame, vvhich affirmethe to have had a vvoman in handes, vvith ſuch an vlceratione vvherbye her throate vvas allmoſt occluded and ſtopped, that vvith great difficultlye ſhee reſpired, &amp; breathed, nether coulde ſhee anye more eate, or drincke, beinge in greate perill, &amp; daunger of death, if ſoe be that in that eſtate ſhe had continued but one day longer, in vvhome this vlceratione vvas ſoe extreamlye ſvvollen, that it had yet ſpreade it ſelfe abroade into tvvo branches more, into the noſtrelles. In vvhich greate neceſſitye, and perplexitye, vvith al expeditione he tooke, a little hooke, vvhervvith he layed houlde one the one branche therof, vvhich vvas come into the noſtrelles, vvhervvith he drevve forth therof a reaſonable qvā
                  titye, and then as deepe as he coulde, he cutt it of, &amp; havinge done the ſame, in the other noſtrell allſoe he hath aperted and opened her mouth &amp; depreſſinge the tunge dovvnevvardes, hath taken houlde on the ſvvellinge and tumefactione, vvith a hooke, &amp; allſoe cutt a great qvantitye therofe, vvithout anye greate ſtore of bloode iſſuinge out of it: This beinge finiſhed, the miſerable &amp; poore vvomā hath immediatlye opened her mouthe &amp; beganne to eate, &amp; drincke vvater. At other ſeaſons alſoe therafter he hath cut avvay ther frō other peeces, but yet notvvithſtādinge, as oftē &amp; as much as he deſcided &amp; cut therof, is increaſed agayne &amp; grovvne thervnto: vvhich vvhē he had marked, he cauteriſed the ſame, &amp; by this meanes in the end hath praevented the excreſcence of this tumefactione: but beinge conſtrayned to take his iourny to ſome other place, coulde never heare, or by any man vnderſtande, hovv it happened therafter vvith her: &amp; it may right vvell be thought, that the cauteriſinge of this diſſeaſe vnto his roote, could not in anye ſorte increaſe agayne, as before it had done.
               
                  It happeneth allſoe ſometimes, that the Almondes ſoe chaūce to ſvvelle, that ther is noe hope left, that vve ſhoulde perforate, or thruſt them throughe, or to binde &amp; tye thē, becauſe ſomtimes it is impoſſible for the patient to open his mouthe, &amp; not beīge able in any ſorte to reſpire, muſt of neceſſitye dye: vvhich perceavinge to be in ſuch an eſtate, vve are then conſtrayned in our extreame neceſſitye, to take our laſt refuge, vnto the makīge of an inſciſione in the throte, or Trachea arteria, rather thē vvith our eyes behoulde the patiēt to ſmother &amp; choake. VVhen as therfore vve vvoulde effect this, vve muſt cauſe the patient to lye, &amp; leane on his backe, and hange his heade backvvardes, becauſe the throte, or Trachea arteria, may evidentlye ſhevve it ſelfe, then vve muſt vvith our fingers, take hould on the ſkinn, of the third, or fourth ringle of the throat, vvher vvith the foreſayed, circles, or rovvndes of the throate are covered, &amp; lifted vp, novv this beinge, ſoe heaved vp, vve muſt accordinge vnto the lōgitude therof make the inſciſiō, vvhiche beinge cut throughe, &amp; agayn let fall, vve ſhal as then perceave the throte bared, &amp; if ſoe be therone vve eſpyed any vayn, vve muſt detrude it one the one ſyde &amp; eſchevve, or avoyde the ſame.

This ſayed pipe muſt in the one end be ſomvvhat broade, vvith a threde theron faſtened, becauſe that through the dravvinge of breath, it doe not chaunce to be dravvne into the throate. Novve the daunger of choakinge beinge paſſed, vve muſt as then take it therout agayne, becauſe that the vvoū

                  Divers Chyrurgicall operations.
                  THere are divers diſſeaſes inſcidente vnto the teeth, vvhich throughe the manuall operation of Chyrurgerye muſt be cured: as by cauteriſinge, of the ſame, &amp; by diſſipation of the gūmes frō the toeth, by filinge, by cuttinge of, by dravvinge by ſettinge, by cuttinge in therofe, &amp; by allegation &amp; bindinge together of the teeth. Thoſe teeth vvhich are ſlimye, &amp; therō, a blacke, yellovve or vvhyte tough matter, &amp; ſōtimes like vnſliſſed lime, or as it vveare ſome putaminous ſubſtāce, chaunced to be therō obdurated, &amp; hardened, vve muſt vvith a little ſcraper, or inſtrument, for that purpoſe make thē cleane &amp; purifye thē, vvithout hurtinge of the gūmes, &amp; looſeninge of the ſame, becauſe that ſuch teeth vvhich are heervvith polluted, are not moſt cōmonlye very faſt: the aged poeple, &amp; the rheumaticke, they vvhich are trovbled in the lūges, or vvhich have anye diſſeaſe in the ſtomack, vvhich in times paſſed have binne infected vvithe the poxe, are commōly ſubiect vnto diſſeaſes of ther teeth: vvhē as this increſcēs is not as yet obdurate or hard vve may then vvith more facilitye remove the ſame, &amp; in the firſt vve muſt vvaſhe the gūmes as vvell of the one as the other vvith a little alume vvater vvherby the increaſinge of this matter is ſōvvhat praevented, &amp; retarded,Practiſe &amp; inventione of the aucthore. &amp; it faſteneth allſoe the gummes vnto the teethe, vvhē as they hāge looſelye therō. Some there are vvhich eſteeme this a greate ſecrete vvhich heertofore I my ſelfe have vſed, to vvitt, that vve take a little Aquafortis, and a little ſticke, as thicke as a quille, the one end therof beinge dipped in this vvater, vvith vvhich end of the foreſayed ſticke, vve muſt vvel rubb the tooth thervvith, dilligētly obſervīge, that noe droppe therof chaūce to falle one the lippes or gū

And if ſoe be thervvith the payne, &amp; the corruptione be not ſeaſed, vve muſt as then vvith Aquafortis cauteriſe the teeth, or vvith oyle of vitroll vvherein vve muſt dippe and moyſtē a little cotten, vvhich neatlye vve muſt thruſt into the cōcavity of the toothe: &amp; if ſo be all theſe remedyes be not ſufficiēt, ther is as thē noe ſurer, or better remedy, thē is the vſe of the actuall Cauteriū, vvhich muſt be proportioned verye little, &amp; accordinge vnto the concavitye of the tooth.
               Other Chyrurgians ther are vvhich hovvld in greate eſteem the filīge of the teethe,Whye vve file the teeth. vvher

they be corrupted, vvhich I alſoe eſteeme to be commodious, vvhen as convenientlye it may be effected, &amp; vvhen the tooth is corrupted but on the one ſyde therof: for by this meanes vve ſhall intercept, &amp; hinder the corruptione of the next toothe ioyninge thervnto, that he be not thervvithe polluted above other commodityes, vvhich therthrough vve ſhal effect.
               
                  Teeth vvhich grovv forth vvith an acuitye.Ther grovveth oftentimes a tooth higher, then the other of the teeth, ether vpvvardes, outvvardes, or invvardes, the poyncte vvherof is ſoe accute, that in ſpeakinge it ether hurteth the tunge or the lippes. Alſoe ſometimes the teethe ar rugged &amp; vnſmoth above, vvherfore they, one the toppes &amp; ſummityes therof be filed, by this meanes to make them ſmoothe, as the other. And convenientlye to vſe the file theron, &amp; to cauſe that the toothe doe not chaunce to ſtirre in the filinge, vve muſt hould faſt vvith our fingers the foreſayed too the, layinge certayne peeces of linnen on the gummes,Teeth vvhich ſtand out of ther ordre, vvhich are brokē &amp; vvherin as yet remayneth ſom little peece. vnto the rootes of the toothe. VVe muſt file of all ſuch teeth vvhich extrud them ſelves externally, vvill not be cōtayned in the ſemicircle of the other teeth, or they vvhich are brokē, &amp; a little peece therof as yet remayninge in the place, leaſt they might chaunce to hurte the tung, or the mouthe.

The payne of the teethe is at ſometimes ſoe vehemēt &amp; in tollerable, becauſe that the tooth, is corrupted vnto his ſynnue, pearced, &amp; is hollovved, that the perſone, is almoſt phrēſye, &amp; cōſideringe that there is ſomtimes noe remedy to be hadde, for the quallifyinge of this payne, he is as then cōſtrayned to cauſe the ſayed tooth to be dravvne, vvhich as then is the certaynſt vvay.

The tooth beinge dravven,The bleedinge of the gummes vvhē as the tooth is dravvne out, is not to be little eſteemed of. vve muſt vvith both our fingers ſhutt, &amp; ioyn together agayn the gummes &amp; cauſe the patiēt to vvaſhe his mouth vvith a little Oxycrate, vvherin vve muſt alſo put in a little ſault. If ſoe be ther vveare any effluxiō of bloode, vve ought not to eſteeme it to be a ſmall matter becauſe I have knovvne ſome to bleed thēſelves to death.
               The aſſuredeſt remedye vvhich I ever have knovvne to be vſed, is this, that divers times, vve muſt thruſt therin ſom cottē, vvhich hath binne madefyed in iuyce of lēmones, vvhich allvvayes vve muſt put in that place, out of the vvhich the tooth vvas dravven.

                  MYe purpoſe, and intent, is not in this place to diſcrib vnto you, vvhat ſickneſſes reqvire phlebotomye, in vvhat age, in vvhat time or ſeaſon of the yeare, in vvhat countrye, in vvhat cōſtitutiō of the body, it muſt be done, &amp; of vvhat occaſione, namelye &amp; eſpeciallye, vvhether it be for anye ſimple evacuation, or for anye deprivatione, or derivatione, or for any revulſione. In like ſorte alſoe in vvhat vayn vve ought to make the apertione, vvhat qvantitye of bloode vve ought to detracte out of the ſame, in vvhat ſorte, and hovv much at one time, hovve often after the other or in vvhat time of the ſicknes vve muſt make the apertione in the vayne.
               But my purpoſe, and meaninge is, onlye to ſhevve, hovv vve ought to opē a vayne: vvheron vve muſt thinck, &amp; dilligentlye conſider, before vve make the apertione therin, after vve have opened her: &amp; vvherone vve ought to not, vvhē the blood iſſveth out of the ſame. This doinge, ſhall the Chyrurgiane, be noe leſſe vvorthye of prayſes, becauſe he cā verye excellentlye phlebotomize, then the phyſitione is prayſe vvorthye, by his perfect knovvledge, vvhether the patiēt have neede of phlebotomy, or not:Why phlebotomye is difficulte, &amp; daū
                     gerous. For although, that it ſeemeth to be a ſmalle ſciēce, to phlebotomize aright, &amp; very vvel, yet notvvithſtandinge is it oftentimes, a difficulte matter &amp; verye daūgerouſe, becauſe the vaynes, ar ſituated ſomtimes cloſe to the Arteryes, yea alſoe thervppen, as alſoe are the ſynnues,Accidentes vvhich are cauſed, &amp; take ther originall of ther hurtinge of anye vayne, ſynnue, arterye, or tendone. &amp; the tēdones. If ſoe be therfore vve chaunce, vvith the lancet to hurte a Tendone, therafter moſt commonlye iſſueth a Spaſmus, or a Gangrene and mortificatione, vvherthroughe the patiēt pitifullye &amp; ruefullye, and vvith great torment endeth his lyfe. If ther be then any arterye touched, &amp; opened, ſhee verye difficultlye vvil be cured, vvherby the patiēt bleedeth to death: &amp; vvhē as vve deſcide a vayne qvite aſunder, both the endes therof are immediatlye retracted, and dravvne invvardes, the one end this vvay, &amp; the other end that vvaye, ſoe that vnder the fleſhe both of the endes are loſt, &amp; noe bloode cā poſſibly iſſve therout: if ſhee be then vvith to great timorouſnes &amp; feare pricked, the ſkinne onlye vvhervvith ſhee is covered is as thē inſcided, &amp; the vayn not opened: or els if ſhee be onlye pricked vvith the poyncte of the lancet, the bloode as thē iſſveth therout droppingevvyſe and the ſubtileſt bloode onlye cometh out, vvher cōſeqvently therafter ſhe exvlcerateth.
               Sometimes alſoe lyeth the vayne occulted ſoe deepe in the fleſhe, that vve can not vvith the lācet finde thē, vvithout great paynes, yea alſo &amp; although vve eſpye them, yet throughe there perpuſillitye, &amp; rotūditye, they avoyde, &amp; eſchevve the poyncte of the lācet, hovv accute &amp; ſubtile ſoever the ſame be.

               Before the Chyrurgian maketh his apertiō in the vayne, if ſoe be the patiēt be reſtringed &amp; bovvnde in his belly, &amp; hath in a lōge time not bīne at ſtool, vve muſt thē firſt of all cauſe him to vſe a Cliſtere, becauſe throughe the phlebotomye, the vaynes beīge evacuated, &amp; emptied, doe not attracte, &amp; dravve vnto thē out of the guttes or entralles, any corrupted, &amp; rottē humors, vvherbye anye of the vvorthyeſt partes might be offende, &amp; hindered.
               Nether is phlebotomye expediēt,Wheron vve ought to cōſider before phlebotomye. vvhen as the ſtomacke, is burthened, ether vvith anye cruditye, of vndigeſted meat, or drincke, or vvith anye other viſcoſitye vvhatſoever, as alſo it is vvholye diſſvvaded to doe after anye

                  ❧How we ought convenientlye, to make an apertione in the vayne. Chap. 2.
               
                  HAvinge dilligētlye conſidered all theſe thinges if the Chyrurgiane,Continvance of the manner rightlye to phlebotove. determine to phlebotomiſe in the right arm, he muſt then take houlde one the foreſayed arme vvith his left hande, by the bendinge of the arm, or about that place, vvherin vve purpoſe tO make the apertione, &amp; lay his thumbe one the vayne, a little belovve the place, vvher vve vvil pricke, becauſe that ſoe he may hovvlde the vayn ſtedefaſte, vvithout glidinge this vvay or that vvay becauſe ſometimes the vayne beinge, ſpanned like a little cord, might chaunce to rovvle, &amp; glide vnder the lancet. And becauſe the foreſayed vayne is oftentimes implete vvith vvinde, &amp; vētoſityes, ſhee therefore yeeldeth, &amp; ſlideth avvay vnder the lancet, vvherthroughe vve can not fullye pearce her, &amp; by this meanes the apertione falleth to ſmall: all this beinge in this ſorte noted, vve muſt vvith the firſt finger of the right hand feele vvhere vvith moſt convenience vve might make the apertione, ſetting an impreſſion on the ſkinne above the vayne vvhere vve purpoſe to pricke, vvith the nayle of your finger, &amp; then immediatlye, take the lancet in the right hande, vvhich betvveene our lippes vve muſt have in a readines, vvith the vvhich vve finelye muſt make our apertione, in the vayne, cauſinge the poyncte, and acuitye of the ſame, gentlye to enter into the concavitye of the vayne, &amp; not abruptly, and rudely, vvith a haſtye thruſt. And to make this apertione vvith more certayntye, &amp; vvithout tremblinge of the handes, the Chyrurgiane muſt take the lancet in the middle, vvith his thumbe &amp; his firſt finger, ſufferinge his hande vvith three of his fingers to reſt on the arme, &amp; ſo lay his thumbe and his firſt finger vvhich hould the lācet one the thumbe vvhich houldeth faſt the vayne, on this ſort to hould faſt his hande, &amp; vvith out anye tremefactione to vſe the ſame. Some there are vvhich annoynt the place vvherin they intende to phlebotomiſe, vvith a little oyle, or vvith freſhe butter, thervvith ſomvvhat to mollifye, &amp; ſoften the ſkinne, &amp; ſoe vvith more eaſe and vvith leſſe payne, to pearce ther throughe.To mollifye the ſkinne.

               If ſoe be then that the apertiō be made vvith one thruſte, it is thē good, but if not, vve muſt immediatly give an other pricke, ether a little belovve the ſame, or els a little above the ſam, if the vayne ſufficiētly demōſtrateth her ſelfe. If therfore the apertiō be to ſmall, &amp; the blood

iſſue out of the ſame to ſubtilelye, ſoe that vve feare that vve ſhall not dravve ſufficiēt blood enough therout, then immediatlye vve muſt thruſt into the ſame hole, or apertione agayn, &amp; a little dilate the ſame: becauſe that oftentimes throughe to ſmall an apertion, the groſſe bloode congealeth before the apertione, and ther conſeqventlye exvlceratethe.
               
                  Why vve muſt give a ſtaffe to them in ther hāde vvhich vve PhlebotomizeHavinge convenientlye brought to paſſe this apertione, vve muſt then give the patiēt, in the hande of that arme vvherin he is phlebotomized, a roūd ſtaffe, partlye therō to reſt his arme, as alſoe to turne rovvnde the foreſayed ſtaffe in his hande, becauſe by this meanes the bloode might the better ſhoote out: the vvhich if it doe not rightlye iſſue out, vve muſt thē marke, if the ligature be not the cauſe therof, as if it vveare to harde tyede, vvhich as then vve muſt a little diſtricte and make it looſe, vvithout vvholye looſeninge of the ſame.
               
                  Broade, &amp; narrovv lancets.The Chyrurgiane muſt alſoe have divers lancets, vvherof the one muſt be a little broader then the other: The broade lancets are verye neceſſarye vvhen as the vaynes lye highe exalted, &amp; vvhen vve deſire to make an ample apertion. The ſmalle narrovve lancets are verye neceſſary, vvhē as the vaynes lye profoūdlye occulted in the fleſhe, and alſo vvhen as in the highe exalted vayne, vve deſyre to make a ſmalle apertion: becauſe ſometimes the ſicke perſonne, reqvireth a great, &amp; feſtivous phlebotomy, to the vvhich end, vve muſt make an ample apertione, as vve muſt alſoe doe, if vve coniecture the bloode to be groſſe, &amp; dēce, &amp; vvhen the patient is luſtye, and ſtronge.
               Contrarilye, if ſoe be vve retract, &amp; dravve back the bloode, vvhich ſupernaturallye hath iſſued out of any parte of our bodye, as in thoſe vvhich, ſpitt bloode, or thoſe vvhich bleede much out of the noſe, as then vve muſt make our apertion ſmalle, becauſe that great evacuation of blood is not neceſſarye for them, becauſe through there noſes they have avoyded ſufficient, then onlye in ſuch accidētes, vvher in is onlye reqvired a regreſſione of bloode. Beſydes, it is neceſſarye &amp; expediēt, that in the foreſayed evacuatione, and ſicknes, vve ſuffer the bloode to iſſve longe enoughe out of the apertione of the vayne, vvhich the patient ſhoulde not be able to ſuffer, if the foreſayed apertione vveare ample, becauſe ther vvould iſſue to much blood othervviſe therout.
               
                  In the Phreneſy vve ought to make but a ſmall apertione.VVe are alſo in phlebotomye vrged to make a ſmall inſciſiō, in thoſe, vvhich are troubled vvith Phreneſye, &amp; in thoſe vvhich are grovvne madde, becauſe that little vvounde might vvith all expedition be cured agayne, becauſe that ſuch raginge▪ &amp; franticke perſons vvill all vvayes make looſe the ligature or dreſſing before vvear therof avvare, vvherof they might com in daunger of bleedinge to death, but the apertione being ſmalle, although they looſen the arme, yet notvvithſtandinge they can not violently bleede becauſe in ſuch a ſmall apertione, the bloode congealeth, &amp; occludeth, &amp; ſtoppeth the vvounde. VVe ought to make in ſmalle vaynes, a ſmalle apertione, &amp; in greate vaynes an ample apertione: for if ſo be vve make in a greate vavne a ſmalle apertion, thē ſhoulde neceſſaryly follovve, that the blood, vvhich coagulateth in the ſmall vaynes, be a hinderāce vnto the iſſuinge or runninge out of the bloode.
               Touchinge the forme, &amp; figure of the inſciſione, it is effected in three ſundrye ſortes, and faſhons: vvherof the firſt is made overthvvarte, the ſecōd accordinge vnto the length of the vayne, vvherthroughe the vayne is cleft or ſplitted, &amp; not pricked: the thirde is the meane betvveene them both, vvhich vve may vvell call the contradictorye apertione, becauſe cō
                  tradictorilye ſhee is made.Three formes of inſciſions in phlebotomye. VVe make the apertione overthvvarte, vvhen as vve are not minded to reiterate the phlebotomy: for vvhē vve bende the ellbovve, thē both the endes of the vayne ioyne together agayne, This figure or forme is neceſſarye, vvhen as vve deſire to make a large apertione. VVe muſt make the apertione ſydelonge or contradictorye, vvhen vve purpoſe to iterate the phlebotomye: and vve makinge the apertione in this manner, verye ſeldome or never miſſe the vayne: and vvhich is more, it is better for the circumſtantes, and ſtanders by, vvhen the bloode in this manner iſſueth therout. That inſciſione, vvhich is made accordinge to the lēgth of the vayne, is verye expedient, vvhen vve intende to renue the bloode lettinge, &amp; that not onlye the ſame day, but one the next day alſoe, becauſe that vvhen vve bende the elbovve, both the labia, or lippes of the vayn, do ſeparate &amp; devide themſelves.
               But in vvhat forme ſoever vve make the inſciſione,The vayne muſt be inſcided in her middle. yet notvvithſtādinge the vayne muſt be pearced in the middle, vvithout vvholye cuttinge a ſunder of the ſame. Becauſe her lippes, might chaunce to be inverted invvardes, and the bloode could not reſulte out of the apertione, but runne dovvn a longe by the arme, or both the endes of the vayne, are dravvē invvardes, vvithout deliverāce of anye blood from her, or at the leaſt, in the firſt very little.

                  Although the vayne be vvel opened, yet ſhee droppeth throughe the afrightednes of the patiēt
                  WE may knovve, that the vayne moſt commōlye is vvell opened, as eaſily vve may perceave by the bloode, vvhen as in the firſte, it rouſheth and as it vveare leapeth out in great haſte, but immediatly altereth vnto droppinge, vvhich throughe the afrightinge of the patient is cauſed, for vvhich reaſon the bloode is dravven invvardes. VVhich vvhen it chaunceth vnto vs, vve muſt vvith patiēce abyde, &amp; and vnbinde it ſomvvhat, and incourage the patient, cauſinge him to move his fingers, &amp; turne,Groſſe bloode doth nothinge but droppe. and cruſh the ſame in his hande. The apertione in the vayne is ſometimes ample enoughe, but becauſe the bloode is groſſe, it can not iſſue out therat, to the vvhich end vve muſt put a little oyle therine, vvhich to that purpoſe is verye profitable.
               If ſoe be therfore the Chyrurgyane, in abſence of the phyſitione, findeth the patiēt verye feeble, and yet notvvithſtandinge, follovvinge the rule, &amp; ordinance of the phyſitione, is verye neceſſarye to be vvell phlebotomized, vve muſt them doe it providentlye, that althoughe, at the firſt vve have not dravvne ſoe much blood as the ſicknes or diſſeaſe reqvireth, vve muſt then, ſome certayne hovvres therafter agayn renue the phlebotomye for the ſeconde time, and if it be needfull yet once agayne, for the thirde time, vvithout over charginge of the patient vvith to great phlebotomye at one time.
               It might alſoe chaūce, that before vve could detracte ſuch a qvantitye of the patiēt as vvas ordayned, and reqvired, the patient might chaunce to be debilitated, and in daunger to fall in great fayntnes, &amp; ſovvndinge, vvheron the Chyrurgiane muſt dilligentlye conſider: as he may eaſyly perceave it, vvhen the patiēt vvaxeth pale, and oppreſſed at his harte, his puls diminiſhinge, &amp; vvhen the bloode runneth dovvne by his arme.What vve ought to doe vvhē vve perceave the fayntinge to approch the patient. VVhich vvhen it chaunceth, the Chyrurgian muſt then immediatlye ſeaſe the bleedinge, layinge his thumbe, one the apertione of the vayne, &amp; lay the patiente on his backe, vvith his heade one a cuſhen, ſprincklinge could vvater in his face, and give him a little vvyne in his mouth, and cauſe him to ſmell at ſome vineger, and then have a little patience, vntill that agayne he reviveth, &amp; comme to himſelfe: for as ſoone as he ſhalbe come to his former ſtrength agayne, vve may as thē finiſhe the phlebotomye.

               After that vve have detractede a reaſonable qvantitye of blood out, vve muſt then diſſolve and make looſe the ligature, and cruſh out the bloode of the vayne, leaſt that the bloode chaunce to congeale therine, and coagulate, and ſoe exulcerate: and if ſoe be ther appeerede anye little parcell of pingvedity, or fat, vve muſt thē gentlye thruſt it in agayne vvith the heade of a pinne, and not cutt it of, and then vvipe of the blood vvhich cleaveth &amp; is dryed or exciccated to the arme, lay a little cōpreſſe, one the apertion, vvhich is madefyed in coulde vvater, and vvinde the ligature, tvvice or thrice aboute the elbovve, like a borgondian croſſe, vvithout tyinge both the endes faſt, before you have cauſed the patient to bende his arme, to laye the ligature therafter.The Ligatione of the elbovve after phlebotomye.

But if ſoe be the Arterye be burſte, there as then iſſueth much bloode therout, vvhich bringeth in the tumefaction more blood, thē vitall ſpirites, vvherfore alſoe it is more obdurate, and harder, and the ſayed bloode coagulateth, and therin rotteth, and corrupteth.
               As much as concerneth the curatione of this tumefactione, it conſiſteth onlye,Curation of Aneuriſma. in the bindinge of the foreſayed arterye, and eſpeciallye the ſame beīge ſomvvhat thicke, for they vvhich are greate, and eſpeciallye the arteryes of the necke, the arme pittes, or of the flanckes, may or can in noe ſorte be tyed, becauſe it is impoſſible to finde them, &amp; make them bare, and if vve allſoe make an inſciſione therin ther then follovveth ſuch a quantitye of bloode, and of the vitall ſpirites, that moſt commō

                   for ſome ther are vvhich are ſhorte, &amp; thicke, others vvhich have a longe necke, &amp; belovve vvyde, vvhich cōmonly dravve better thē any other. Others are of divers ſubſtance, for ther are ſome of Copper, others of Horne, of Tinne, and of glaſſe, vvhich vve moſt commonlye vſe, becauſe throughe the glaſſe vve might ſee, vvhether they dravve much bloode or not. Ther are alſoe ſome vvhich are made of vvoode, and ſome baked of earthe: yea for vvant of Boxes, vve may vſe little vvooddē diſhes, or little earthen pottes. Touchinge ther forme, they muſt have a vvyde mouth, and a reaſonable broade bellye, thicke &amp; rovvnde edges, becauſe in the applyinge therof they ſhould not chaunce to hurte.
               And if ſoe be they are very greate, they muſt thē have a little hoale on the one ſyde, vvhich vvith vvaxe muſt be occluded, befor vve apply thē that vve may give thē ayr, vvhē vve vvill take of the ſame, ſome ther are, vvhich lay a little ſticke, croſſe over in the mouth therof, on the vvhich they impoſe a little peece, or inche of a

candle, vvhich in the application therof they incende, and light.
               
                  Hovv vve ſhall applye the boxes.The manner of applicatione is this. That vve firſt of all, perfricate, and rubbe the place Vvherone vve intend to applye thē ſituatinge that parte of applicatione, in the right forme therof, becauſe the muſcles, may lye in ther right ſituatione, and places, and not be recurved this vvay, or that vvaye, becauſe the boxes beinge theron faſtened, might not vvithe the reflection of the parte, or ioyncte, fall therof, vvhen as the foreſayed recurved muſcles, ſhoulde reverte agayne to there accuſtomed locationes, and places. This beinge done, vve muſt impoſe therone a counter or any other peece of coine, vvith a little, flocke of flexe, or tovve incended in the middeſt of that place, vvherone vve deſire to applye the Boxes, leaſt that the fyer chaunce to touche the ſkinne, vvheron immediatlye, vve muſt vvhelve the Boxes, turninge the ſame a little rovvnde, becauſe he ſhoulde the better faſten theron: the vvhich as then vve muſt cover, vvith a dubble vvarmed cloute. Some there are vvhich in the bottome of the Boxes applye and laye a plaſter, and therone a little tovve, in place of an inche of candle, vvhich in the applicatiō, theyt ſet one fire, vvith a candle.
               
                  Diſcriptione of the horne Boxes.As touchinghe the hornes, they are vvyde above, and narrovve belovve, havinge a little perforatione in ther middeſt, and internally, a little leatherne tūge, vvhich is very thinne, vvhich ſtoppeth the foreſayed hoales. They are applyed vvithout fyer, &amp; ſucked vvith the mouthe.

               Thoſe vvhich are ignorant of this ſecrete, ſtoppe, &amp; occlude the hole vvith a little vvaxe, vvhich in deede is not ſo neceſſarye, and needfulle. Thoſe little Boxes vvhich are layed in vvarme vvater, are aplyed, after that vve have putt the flame of the candle, therin and muſt then vvith all expeditione be theron impoſed.

               To conclude, vve may applye them,The Boxes may be applyed one all partes of mans bodye. on all partes of mans bodye, yea allſoe one the ſelfe ſame place vvhere the payn is, vvhich vve endevoure to cure, to retract and dravve therout all humors, vvhich are therī ſecluded, as vvhē vve deſire to dravve any humors outvvardes, vvhich lye profoundlye &amp; deepelye occulted, and hiddē, or els alſoe, any ventoſitye, vvhich in the foreſayed parte lyeth incloſed, as on anye bitt, or pricke, of any venoumous creature, leaſt that the venoume might chaunce to penetrate and pearce, into ſome of the vvorthyeſt partes: one the Venus botches, or Bubones, one the venoumouſe, &amp; Peſtilentialle Parotides. But deſiringe to applye them agaynſt anye ſuperfluous efluxione of bloode, vve muſt then ſituate them on the contrarye ſyde conſideringe the allyance, &amp; communitye of the vaynes vvhich is betvveene them, throughe the vvhich the bloode is retracted, &amp; dravven backe. It chaunceth alſo ſomtimes, that vve nether applye the Boxes, on the diſſeaſed, or dolorouſe place, nether one the contrarye ſyde therof, but one that parte vvhich nexte, and proximately thervnto is ſituated: as vvhē vve deſire to ſuſcitate and provoacke, the retayned and kept backe meſtruoſityes, vve as then place the Boxes, one the bone Pubis in the flanckes, and allſoe one the flatnes of the hippes.
               The Boxes, or hornes, are ſōtimes applyed vvith ſcarificationes, and ſomtimes vvithout: If ſoe be vve applye them vvithout ſcarificationes, they then onlye dravve certayn dampes vnto them: but if ther be anye badde humors, in thoſe partes, vve as then ſcarifye it: And the diſſeaſe proceedinge out of vvindes, and ventoſityes,

In delicate, and dayntye perſons, vvhich are tender of fleſhe, and have an aperte or open ſkinne, in ſuch perſons vve muſt ſcarifye but once, notvvithſtandinge muſt apply the boxes tvvo, or three times after other theron: vvhich beinge finiſhed, and havinge vviped, and dryed the parte, vve muſt then apply one the ſcarlficatione, the Cerotum Galeni, or els the Vnguentum Roſarum.

                  Diſctiption of the naturall bones The bones are as vvell ſubiected vnto all mā
                     ner of diſſeaſes, as is the fleſhe.
                  THe bones, not being ſpoylede &amp; corrupt, are of natur vvhyt ſmooth, &amp; ſolide. They are accordinge to the ſayinges of aunciente Chyrurgianes and our dayly experience, ſubiected vnto all evell diſpoſitions, vvhich the fleſh is ſubiected vnto, yea allſo vnto apoſtematiōs. Celſus avouchethe, that all bones vvhich have any impedimēt, are ether hurte, corrodede, corrupted, burſt, broken, cruſhed, plettered, or out of ioyncte. VVe may praeiudice the bones to be altered,To knovv the corrupted bones throughe ſight. or polluted, throughe our ſight feelinge, matter, and impuritye, vvhich therout iſſueth: vvhē vve perceave it to be yellovv or purple, and at the laſt blacke, &amp; as verye learned lye, &amp; diſcretlye the ſayed Author, vvriteth, firſt the corrupted bone vvaxeth fattye then blacke,Through feelinge. or putilaginous, that is corroded: vvhen as in touchinge vvith the privet or ſearchinge irō, vve feele the bone to be rugged, and not playn, and the privet, entereth therin, as if it vveare a peece of corrupted, &amp; vvorme eaten vvoode, &amp; eſpecially vve knovvinge the ſame not to have binn bared of his fleſhe, nether hath binn of the ayre illuminated: becauſe that ſometimes the altered bone, for that it hath a longe vvhile lyen bare, is grovvē to be ſoe harde, &amp; thicke, thar vvithout greate paynes, vve can not faſten therō vvith the grating iron, through the matter, vvhich is thinne,Through the matter. &amp; ſubtile, cleere, faetide, ſtinckinge, &amp; blackiſhe: vvhen as rovvnd aboute the vlceration eſpeciallye, is regenerated a tender &amp; viſcouſe fleſh vvher through the vlceration can not, be cicatrized, &amp; although ſhee be cicatrized, therafter redubleth herforces, &amp; breacketh open agayne.Occaſion of the corruption of the bones Such alteration procedeth of ſome cōcurrēt humors, that deſcēde on the bared bones, as appeareth vvhen they are through ſoackede vvith any peſtiferouſe humors, or els becauſe they are of their fleſh &amp; pellicle, or mēbrane Perioſtio, denudatede and barede vvherthrough

they corrupte &amp; vvaxe drye for vvant of blood vvhervvith they ſhoulde be nouriſhed, or els becauſe they are to full of humiditye, &amp; moyſture, throughe the purulēt matter, vvhich cō
                  tinuallye theron diſtilleth, &amp; corrodeth: ether becauſe they are to much ānoyncted vvith oyle, &amp; to much fatty ſalves therō applyed, vvherby the vlceration is corrupted, &amp; putrified: Or becauſe ſhe is polluted, vvith the matter of the vlceratione, vvhich ſupernaturallye, &amp; from above is deſcēded &amp; theron diſtilled.
               VVhēas therfore for certaynty vve knovve that ther is putrefactiō, &amp; rottēnes in the bone vve muſt then doe our devoyr to knovv hovv lardge, &amp; profovvnd the ſame is, becauſe therby vve may the ſurer knovv, hovv vvith moſte conveniēce vve ſhoulde remove &amp; aboliſhe the ſame &amp; cauſe therin a ſeparatione, becauſe it is neceſſarye that the vivificēt parte, expelle &amp; drive from it the mortified, or els the mortifiede allſo cauſe mortificatione in the vivificent partes.
               
                  Magnitude of the putrefactiō.Concerninge the magnitude thereof, vve may diſcerne it through the ſight, vnleſſe it be operted vvith any viſcoufe or ſlimye fleſh, &amp; vve ſuppoſing &amp; doubtinge to be more putrefactione of bones, that is patefiede &amp; evidente vnto vs, throughe the circumiacent partes of the vlceraration, vvhich as then are purple coloured through the ſpongiouſe fleſh, through the elevatione of the edges of the vlceratione &amp; throughe the diuturnalle continuāce of the ſame in one eſtate:Hippocrates. For as Hippocrates affirmeth: In the venomouſe vlcerations, vvhich for the ſpace of a yeare have continuede, or longer, it can not othervviſe be, but neceſſarilye in the bone vnder the fleſhe of the vlceratione, muſt needes be a corruptione, putrefaction &amp; a corroſione, &amp; ſome peeces therof come out, the Cicatriſes alſo vvill continually be cōcavouſe, &amp; hollovve.To cure the putrefacted bones. VVe therfore certaynlye knovvinge this, vve muſte as then dilate the vlceratiō denudate the bone, &amp; dilligentlye marck hovv large the foreſayede putfactiō is: vvhich muſte be effectede vvith cauſticke medicamentes, by the vvhich the ſpongiouſe fleſhe, mvſt be cō
                  ſumede, accordinge as the foreſayede vlceratiō reqvireth. Celſus councelleth vs that firſte vve make an inſciſione in the ſkīne, to denudate the bone, if ſo be the putrefaction of the bone, be greater then the vlceratione, diſcidinge &amp; cuttinge of all the fleſh rovvnde aboute, vnto the ſovvnde bone: touchinge the depth of the putrefactione of the bone, vve may knovve it throughe the privet or ſearchinge iron, vvhen as vve feele theron, the vvhich pearcinge deep or not deep in the ſame, ſhevveth vnto vs that the foreſayede corruptione of bone is great or ſmalle. But if vv ſee the bone to be blacke &amp; dry as it happeneth bereft of blood the privet thē vvill not enter therin, vvherfore the depth of ſuch a corruptione, can ſo certaynly be knovven, as through the perforative Trepane, or els through the little groūd dravver, vvherevvith vve muſt perforate the foreſayede bone through vvhich perforatione of bone, vve eaſily ſhalle perceave, vvhether the bone be blacke, vvhyte, or redde, &amp; vvhether ther iſſuethe bloode out or not if it be ſo, it is then a ſigne that the putrefaction, of the bone is not deep. And if ſo be vve perceave, the perforated bone to be blacke, it is then a token, that the putrefactione is deepe, becauſe the corruptione of the bone, pearceth ſo deepe, &amp; vvhen vve perceave that the bone is vvhyte, &amp; redde, ſo farre is it then incorruptede.
               To the vvhich Caries, or corrupting of bōes vve muſte vſe the actualle Cauterye, or els allſo the potentialle or the Raſpatorium: If ſo be the corruptione of the bone penetrateth not verye deepe,Hovv lōg vve ought to raſpe. vve muſte then grate the foreſayed bone vvith a peculiare Raſpatorye, &amp; in raſpinge of the ſame, ſtifly cruſh therō, that vve may qvicklye penetrate through the corruptione, &amp; the operatione, vvih all feſtinatione be effectede &amp; done. All daūger beinge novv paſſed, &amp; vve perceavinge the bone to be vvhyte, ſmooth pure, &amp; ſolide, it is then ſufficient: For it is impoſſible, that the foreſayede corruptione of bones may have an end, as long as vve doe not liberat, &amp; free the ſame, by one meās or other, from all daūger, &amp; corruptiō. VVhen vve perceave, in raſpinge the bone to give bloode from it, it is then a ſigne that all corruptione is therout, and that the bone is vvell diſpoſed, becauſe that no corrupte or alterede bones vvill give from thē any bloode. This beinge done, vve as then vſe the poulder of Ariſtolochiae of Mirrha of Ireas &amp; of Aloe to liberate the foreſayed bone frō al corruption &amp; praevente the ſame to be anye more putrefacted and corrupted. If vve ſuppoſe, that the Raſpatorium, be not ſufficient enough, to remove the foreſayed corruption, as vvhē ſhe is deeply corroded invvardes,The fyer is the ſureſt remedye to repel all corruptions out of the bōes. &amp; vvhen as ther is a peculiare corruptiō imprinted in the bone, the ſame alſoe being fatt, &amp; oylye, &amp; if ſo be the patient vveare not timorouſe of the fyer, the afſuredeſt remedye as then is, that vve cauterize the foreſayed coruption, vvith an actuall Cauterye, vvhich conforteth that parte, and conſumeth all venoumouſe humors, &amp; vvith all feſtinatione cauſeth the corrupted bones to ſeparate, &amp; cauſeth little, or noe payn at all, becauſe the foreſayed bone is inſenſible, and doth not communicate his vnhemence vnto the other circumiacent partes.
               VVhen as therfore,Māner hovv to apply the Cauterye. vve deſire to vſe it accordinge to the depthe, &amp; greatnes of the coruption, or Caries, vve muſt therin vſe a meane, of applyinge the foreſayed Cauteriū
                   on the bone,

to vvitt vntill through the poroſitye of the bone ther commeth out, a frothye matter, &amp; noe lōger: for if vve helde it lōger theron, it ſhould through his great callidity, &amp; throughe the exſiccatinge vertues therof, not onlye conſume, the humeditye of the putrefaction of the bone but alſoe the naturall humiditye, &amp; moyſture through vvhich occaſiō, the fleſhe ingendreth &amp; increaſeth betvveene the ſovvnde &amp; the corrupte bones: This doinge, nature in a certayne time therafter, vvill ſeparate the corrupted bone, frō the ſovvndebone, engendringe betvveē them bothe, a tenerouſe fleſhe, vvhich by little &amp; little hardeneth, as if it vveare Pomgranate-kernelles, vvhich foreſayed fleſhe, vve oftentimes may ſee, grovve cleane throughe the corrupted bone, &amp; that in ſuch ſorte, as the ſmalle tender graſſe, grovveth through the grovvnde, &amp; as thē is the ſuppuration, &amp; matter goode &amp; laudable, vvhyte, or reddiſhe coloured, and vvithout ſtincke. And vve muſt heere alſoe farther note, that the Chyrurgian, may ſomtimes gentlely move, the corrupted bone being cauterized, &amp; ſtirre it, becauſe nature ther through may be opitulated, vnto the ſeparatione of the cauteriſed bone, and the foreſayed bone lyinge ſōvvhat rayſed, may be lifted on highe, becauſe as thē it houldeth faſt noevvhere, but vve may not vvith any violēce take the ſame therof, for in ſoe doing, the ſovvnde, bone, before cōpletlye it be covered vvith fleſhe might chaunce of the ayre, to be agayne infected, and corrupted.
               
                  The Cauterization muſt be reiteratedNether is it ſufficiēt, that once vve apply the Cauterye theron, but muſt divers &amp; ſundrye times doe the ſame, nether muſt it be glovvinge or red hott, but reaſonable hott, removinge of the forſayed cautery frō one place of the bone to the other, or houldīg of the ſame in one place, vntill the place be throughlye vvarmed.
               
                  What vve ought to doe in a deep Caries.The corruptiō, therfore or Caries being very deep, vve muſt them trepane or boare it vvith a perforative Trepane, vnto the ſovvnd bone, or vvith the ſmall grounde dravver, make divers hoales therin, the one cloſe to the other, of an aeqvall depth alſo, as the corruption of the bone is, in vvhich trepaned hoales, vve muſt as thē apply ſome little hott actuall cauteryes becauſe the foreſayed bone, ther by may be throughlye dryed: By this operation, the corrupted bone vvill ſeparate it ſelfe frō the ſovvnde bone, as heertofore vve have ſayed. If ſoe be that the vvhole ſubſtāce of the bone be corrupted, &amp; corroded, vve muſt then vvholye remove, &amp; take the ſame a vvay.A hiſtorye of Albucasis. As Albucaſis, to this purpoſe, reciteth a memorable hiſtory of on vvhome at three ſūdry times he tooke avvay allmoſt the vvhole ſhinne bone, dividing alſo the operation, in thre ſundrye &amp; aeqvall times, becauſe the patient vvas not able, to tollerate ſoe greate payne, becauſe of his great imbicillitye, &amp; alſoe becauſe Albucaſis feared leaſt that vnder his hā
                  des he ſhould have diede, becauſe through certayne evacuations, he allvvayes fell into great fayntnes, but in the end vvas perfectlye cured: and in place of bone, ther ingendred in the place, a harde carnoſitye, vvhich ſo miraculouſlye fortifyed from day to day, that he during ſome continuance of time therafter, coulde agayne couragiouſlye goe one that legge.
               VVhē as therfore it is reqviſite, to applye the foreſayed actuall Cauterye one anye certayne place, vve muſt dilligentlye conſider, hovv vve might liberate, &amp; defende,The circumiacēt partes of the vlceration muſt be freede. the circumiacēt partes of the Vlceratione, leaſt they be touched of the cautery, vvhich vve may vvith moſt conveniēce doe, vvith ſome certayne plaſters, becauſ nether the fatt nor any other ebullient humiditye, vvhich through the calliditye or heate of the cauterye might chaunce to runne therout, one the ſelfe ſame circumiacēt partes, of the vlceratiō, &amp; that therby they chaunced not to be burned, &amp; ſeared, vvhich vvould be the cauſe of greate payne and doloure.
               Novv therfore to correct &amp; cure the Caries, or corruptiō of bones, ther are divers Chyrurgianes of our times &amp; age, in place of the actuall Cauterye vſe the potentialle:Divers remedyes agaynſt the Caries. amongeſt the vvhich the oyle of vitrioll is in the moſt cheefeſt, in like ſort alſoe the oyle of franckinſēce, vvhich of divers Chyrurgians is highlye commended, and eſteemed.

                  ANd becauſe vve have not heer intended generally to vvrite of al fiſtles, &amp; to diſcourſ of theire matter, &amp; conditions, vvhat partes be therof polluted, of their occaſiones, ſignes, prognoſticationes, &amp; of the remedyes, of theire cures, it ſeemed expedient vnto me, breefelye to ſhevve, the meanes, to cure thoſe vvhich reveale, &amp; demōſtrate thēſelves in the Fundament, &amp; that eſpeciallye through a convenient handlinge,Intention of the Aucthor. or operatione of Chyrurgerye vvhen as ſhortlye and breeflye I ſhall have taught, in vvhat ſorte vve may beſt and eaſyeſt knovve them.
               Thoſe Fiſtles vvhich are ingēdred in the fundament, are of divers &amp; ſundry ſortes: for ſome of thē are occulte, others patefyede, the occulted are ſoe called, becauſe vve noe vvher externally eſpye them, and internally in the foreſayed fundament,The fiſtles of the fū
                     dament, are ether-hidden or aperte. or excrementall gutt have theire apertiō, &amp; iſſue in the muſcle Sphincter, vvhether they be ſituated vpvvardes or dovvnvvardes, or any vvher one the ſyde, adioninge vnto any of the tvvo buttockes. VVhich allthoughe

vve can not evidentlye perceave them, yet may iudge, that the foreſayed partes, are hurte or hī
                  dered, throughe the payne and throughe the ſtinckinge matter, and humiditye, vvhich iſſueth out of the foreſayed fundament, &amp; through the vvhich commonlye, the ſhirtes of the patient are polluted, &amp; throughe certayne vlcerations alſo, vvhich before times in that parte they have hadde, or through certayne internall hemorrhodes, or through any inveterate vvoūd, vvhich vvas badly cured. VVe may alſo ſomtimes ſee them vvithe our eyes, through the Speculum Ani.
               
               
                  The patefyed Fiſtles of the ſudamēt.The patefyed Fiſtles, are therfore ſoe called, becauſe immediatlye vvithout any daūger vve may evidentlye ſee them: Of the vvhich ther are ſome vvhich lye croocked, and curved, &amp; although they have but one apertion, vvhich viſiblye vve may ſee, yet they have divers vvayes, branches, or cubicles, like Conyeburrovves, vvhich of theire patent Orificium, in the bodye, runne this vvay and that vvay, vvhich vvith the ſearchinge iron ſomtimes vve may finde, vvhē as vve thruſt it this vvay or that vvay, vvher vve feele it of his ovvne accorde to enter, together alſo, out of the great qvantity of matter, vvhich daylye iſſueth therout, vve may eaſylye iudge, that the foreſayed Fiſtle, muſt needes have more concavityes, then by the externall fiſtulouſe apertione vve can iudge, vvhich at ſomtimes is not greate.
               Ther are alſoe ſome Fiſtles, vvhich externallye have but one iſſue, and doe not paſſe throughe the concavitye of the externall, or arſegutt, or through the muſcle Sphincter, as eaſyly throughe the privet or ſearchinge vve may perceave vvhen vve thruſting the ſame therin, vve cā not anye vvher perceave it agaynſt our fingers, to the vvhich intent vve muſt thruſt the ſame middle finger of the left hand in the fundamēt, for if it ſoe be that vve betvveen our finger, and the privet feele anye thinge it is then a ſigne that it doth not pearce throughe but if vve feele it agaynſt our finger, it the pearceth throughe.
               And novv as concerning the curation of the ſame,A thre foulde meanes to cure the Fiſtles of the fundament. vve vvill not heere treate of anye thinges belonging vnto the medicamentes, but onlye ſpeake of the Chyrurgerye to the curing of this diſſeaſe: the vvhich on a threefoulde manner is taught vnto vs, as vvell in the curatione of the internalle, as externalle Fiſtles: to vvitt, ether throughe ligature, inſciſione, or through Cauterye.
               Although Avicenna, vvith more others are of opinione, that vvith anye of theſe foreſayed remedyes vve ought in noe ſort to meddle ther vvith vnles, they vveare too intollerable, and moleſtiouſe vnto the patiēt, but that vvith cleane linnen, vvith Cotten, and vvith decent and convenient lavamentes, vve ought to ſuſtayne them. But for all this not vvithſtanding, I vvill heere diſcribe vnto you, our vſe and cuſtomes of the auncient Chyrugians.
               Novv therfore as vvell to cure the publiqve, and patent Fiſtles, as the occult and hidden, vve muſt cauſe the patient conveniently to lye, namelye that the patient muſt lye one his backe, vvith his legges on highe, retayning and houldinge the foreſayed legges, cloſe vnto his belly, and this is the maner, and cuſtomes of ayncient Chyrurgians. But vve novve a dayes, cauſe the patiēt to ſtande on both his legges, vvith his heade, lyinge on a bedde, diſioyninge &amp; ſeparatīge the foreſayed legges vvyde the one frō the other, vvhich alſoe of tvvo ſervantes or ſtā
                  ders by muſt ſoe be helde, leaſt that he agayne might chaunce to ſhut them. The patient being thus ſituated, tovvardes the light, vve ſhall then thruſt the middlemoſt finger of the left hande into the fundamente, havinge vvith ſome certayne oyle anoyncted your finger, and pared cloſe your nayles: and in our right hande vve muſt have a privet or ſearchinge irō, in forme of a needle, in the vvhich at the on end ther of muſt be a threde, vvhich foreſayed needle, or Privet vve muſt thruſt into the Orificium of the Fiſtle vntill vve ſenſibly feele the ſame on our finger, and then vvith our finger recurvate, the end of the foreſayed needle, &amp; neatlye, &amp; conveniently reduce the ſame vnto the fundamēt, and then dravve the ſame therout, dilligentlye obſervinge, that internally vve hurte or vvoū
                  de nothinge,Hovv vve muſt bind a publique, or patent Fiſtle. and the threde alſoe beinge paſſed throughe the fundament vve muſt then cut of the foreſayed needle from the threde, &amp; tye the endes of the foreſayed threde both together, dravvinge the ſame reaſonable faſt, and cloſe together, and vvith a ſlidinge knott binde the ſame together, becauſe daylye vve might knitt the ſame cloſer, and continuinge this ſame ſoe longe in this ſorte, vntill ſuch time as vve ſhall have cutt avvay all the thred vvhich vvas remayninghe betvveene, both the Orificia, and both the apertions become to one, and the threde conſeqventlye, vvithout anye more diſſectione of the ſame, ſhalbe taken thereout.
               But vve perceavinge the Fiſtle to have no iſſue in the concavitye the arſegutt, and the needle doth not come out agaynſt our finger beinge in the foreſayed arſegutt, and that ther as yet is ſome pellicle, or membrane betvveene them both, the needle havinge a reaſonable ſharpe acuitye or poyncte, vve muſt thruſt the foreſayed threded needle, or Privett, bouldlye, and audaciouſelye therthroughe, into the foreſayed concavitye of the Arſegutt, becauſe vve might alſo dravv the foreſayed thred therout, as alreadye above vve have mētioned.
               
                  VVe muſt alſoe heere farther note, that this privet, or needle, muſt ether be of goulde or ſilver, becauſe ſhee may the eaſyer internallye in the foreſayed gutt be recurved. VVe vſe heervnto a ſilver plate, vvhich thervnto expreſſely, vve cauſed to be made, as this ſame plate, &amp; the foreſayed Privett, or needle, before amōgſt the figures of the inſtrumentes, are alſo defigured, and ſett dovvne vnto vs.
               The threde muſt be of courſe thred, the ſame being tvviſted thre or foure times dubble. And becauſe that vnto ſome, the diſſectione of this ſimple threde, falleth ſomvvhat tediouſe, they annoyncte the ſame vvith ſome Cauſticke medicamētes. Gvido,
                  Opinion of Gvido. effecteth this diſſection, vvith a reſcindent actuall Cauterye, &amp; to praevent the ſame that it pearce noe deeper, then it ought, he thruſteth in the fiiſtle a hollovv Privett, on the vvhich concavitye, he vvith the foreſayed Cauterye pearceth the ſkinne, and in like ſort alſoe cutteth throughe the fiſtle, bringeth, &amp; dirimateth avvay vvith it the calloſitye, &amp; praeventeth alſo the fluxione of bloode.
               
                  It is ſurer to make an inſciſion in the fiſtle, thē to tye it.Others vvil not in anye ſorte, have the fiſtle cauterized, nor bovvnde, &amp; tyed, but vvill only have that ſame to be inſcided vvith a croocked lancett, vvhich is betvveene both the Oriſicia, to vvitt of the fiſtle, and the excrementall, or arſegutt, &amp; that alſoe vvhich internallye is grovven callouſe, they vvill have it to be crudifyed and made ravv, or excoriated, as vve are vſed to doe in the haremouthes: yet daylye experience teacheth vs, that the ligature is more certayne, thē the inſciſione, vvherin vve neede not to take avvaye the calloſity, becauſe it oftētimes chaū
                  ceth, that vve endevoringe to remove, and take avvay this calloſitye, vve diſcide, and cutt of any of the Fibres, of the muſcle Spincter, vvhich beinge vvounded, or hurte, the patient ther after can in no ſorte reſtraygne his ſtooles, or excrementes.
               It may ſeeme admiraculouſe, &amp; ſtrange vnto ſome, that I vvrite that, the fiſtle may be cured throughe the ligature onlye, vvithout removinge the calloſitye, becauſe it ſeemeth oppugnant vnto reaſon, becauſe all combinatione, &amp; healinge together, is cauſed throughe the ioyninge or touching of vveake thinges together: yet I dare affirme, that all thoſe, vvhich I have ſeen tyed, have bin perfectlye and ſovvndlye cured vvithout in any ſort to have touched, or removed the calloſitye.
               Novv to come to the operation of the hidden fiſtles, havinge ſituated the patient as before is ſayed, vve muſt then applye therin, the Speculum Ani, opening the fundamēt thervvith, vvith the leaſt payn vve cā, as vvyde as is poſſible, allvvayes annoynctinge the foreſayed Speculum vvith oyle, throughe the vvhich ſayed apertione, the Oriſicium, of the vlceratione may appeare &amp; be apparēt vnto vs, be-tvvixt vvhich concavityes or braunches, vve muſt thruſt in a privet, vvhich muſt be of a reaſonable thickenes, or craſitude, like vnto a ſmall &amp; little needle vvherevvith vve are vvonted to make our ſtitches, vvhich muſt be blunte, &amp; in the one end muſt vvith a threede be threded, vvhich foreſayed needle, or privet, vve muſt thruſt vnto the bottome, or grovvnde of the fiſtle, vvhich penetrateth vnto the ſkinne, as vve eaſily may feele vvith our finger, on the vvhich, vvith the croocked lancet vve muſt make an inſciſion, &amp; the needle beinge in this ſorte paſſed through, &amp; the Speculū Ani beinge taken avvay, vve muſt then dravve out the needle, and cutt her from the thred, and tye bothe the endes therof together.
               Other ſay vve ought beſides the privett, internallye to make an inſciſione throughe the vvhol Fiſtle, vnto the other hole, vvhich is made on the other ſyde: but there is moſt certayntye in the ligatione, to avoyde the effluxion of bloode, vvhenas ther is ſufficient floſh enough betvveene.
               Ther have binne certayn auntient Chyrurgianes, vvhich coulde not agree vnto the Speculum Ani, but have onlye thruſt there finger into the fundament, to dilate the ſame, and beſydes the ſame a thinne and puſille privett, vvhervvith they have ſoe longe felt thervvith this vvay and that vvay &amp; vp, and dovvne, till ſuch time as they have fovvnde the Orificium, of the fiſtle, vvhich is felt as if it vveare a thinge rent, or torne, and novv hauinge fovvnde the foreſayed Orificium,
                  An other practice or inventione. they then cloſe to ther finger thruſt in the privett, conducinge the ſame alonge the finger ſupernallye, or vpvvardes, or thether vvher they ſuppoſe the bottome, or ground of the fiſtle to deſiſte, and end: vvhich throughe feelinge of the finger of the other hand vve may eaſylye diſcerne: and havinge fovvnde the end therof, and perceavinge the ſkinne or the fleſhe not to be verye thicke, in ſtede of ligatione, vve violentlye thruſt the privett ther throughe, vpvvardes, the privett beinge paſſed therthroughe, they then cutt open all that vvhich is ſituated betvveen the tvvo Orificia of the Vlceration, or els they thruſt a threde ther throughe, and ſoe binde it throughe.
               Amongſt thoſe vvhich are of opinione, that vve ought to cure the fiſtle throughe an actuall Cauterye Albucaſis diſcribeth vnto vs the meanes,Albucaſis vvillinge vs to vſe a Cauterye of iron thervnto, vvhich muſt be verye ſubtile, and glovvinge, or redhott, and that it be proportioned accordinge to the greatnes of the fiſtle, thruſtinge the ſame tvvice, or thrice therin, vntill ſuch time as all the calloſitye is taken avvay ther from, laudinge the fervent, &amp;

glovvinge Cauterye, above the cuttinge or reſcindent Cauterye, becauſe the glovvinge Cautery, as he ſayeth correcteth and amendeth the vntēperatnes of that parte &amp; ther follovveth noe effluxione of blood the calloſity therof is burned avvay, &amp; the ſuperfluouſe humidity is exſiccated, vvhich vvas concurſed, and aſſembled together vnto that patte.

                  THe externalle membres of mās bodye, as are Armes, &amp; legges, are cutt, or ſavved of, vvhen as they are ſqviſed, plettered, and brokē, the Vaynes, Arteryes, &amp; Synues, vvholy be lacerated, &amp; cutt of: Or els vvhen they concerninge any externalle occaſione are hurte, or indammaged, vvherby they ſōtimes vvholy come to be mortifyed, &amp; that ſuddaynlye, or els ſomtimes alſoe by degrees, ſo that ſomtimes ther enſueth ſuch a Gangraena, or mortification, that not only the fleſhe, &amp; all the other mollifyed partes, of the foreſayed ioyncte, doe mortify &amp; corrupte, but alſoe the Bones themſelves, ſoe that ther is noe hope at all, of any health, then onlye throughe the extirpatione of the ſame, fearinge leaſt that the foreſayed Gangraena, ſhoulde farther infect &amp; pollute all the circumiacent partes, vvherethroughe the patient might ſuddaynlye chaūce to dye. Notvvithſtandinge the Chyrurgiane may not in anye forte aproch vnto his exſtreame, &amp; laſt remedye, before he have tryed all other remedyes, to eaſe &amp; appeaſe this forſayed mortificatione, &amp; to ſave the ioyncte: becauſe that ſuch an operatione,Extirpatione of any ioyncte, is effected vvith great daunger. can not be done, then throughe extreame daunger, as oftentimes the patientes themſelves, doe dye vnder our hādes, becauſe of the great effluxione of bloode, or els ſome greate fayntnes. Others immediatly after the extirpatione fall into a Phrenſye, in extreame, &amp; intollerable payne, in Spaſmo, in a coulde ſvveat, vvheron praeſentlye, follovveth death. VVherfore firſt of all vve ought to admoniſhe the frendes, &amp; kinſfolke of the patient, &amp; certifye vnto them that this operatiō is full of daū
                  ger, and is as vvell lamentable for the Chyrurgiane as for to patient: and that vve ought not therof the make anye greate matter of vvorth, or eſtimation, ſeinge ther is no other hope, nor anye other ſucceſſe to be expected, &amp; that it ſeemeth more convenient, and neceſſarye, to extirpate the mortifyed ioyncte, and ſoe to avoyde &amp; flye death, vvhich is more terrible, and fearfull, then the loſſe onlye of one ioyncte.
               And before vve beginne this operatione, &amp; that vve muſt extirpate, the foreſayed ioyncte, it is neceſſary that firſt of al vve knovv, the place vvher it muſt be done,Reaſon, hovv to make choyſe of the place, vvher vve ſhoulde extirpate the ioyncte. becauſe of divers opinions vvhich are hadde therof: for ſome are of opinione, that in the ioyncte vve ought to doe it, becauſe in this place it vvoulde fall eaſyer for the Chyrurgiane to execute the ſame, &amp; is alſoe more tollerable and eaſyer for the patient, bebecauſe ther it may be done vvith more feſtinatione, vvith a ſimple inſciſion of a vvell reſcindent and cuttinge knife, if onlye the Chyrurgiane be agile, and experte, in findinge of the ioyncte.

And vvhich is more, if vve extirpate a membre in the ioyncte, the marrovve, of the pipe as thē is not denudated, becauſe of the Epiphyſis, vvhervvith it is covered, and contayned: But contrarilye if vve ſavve throughe the focille, or pipe, the marrovve as thē is denudated, for the praeſervatione of vvhich Nature vvith greate difficultye, muſt have a longe time, to engēdre a Callum thervnto, and to cover it, becauſe nature muſt ſeparate that end of the ſavved bone: And beſydes all this, ther follovveth noe ſuperfluous effluxion of bloode, as Hippocrates in his boocke of Hemorrhoidibus, vvitneſſeth vnto vs.

VVherfore I alſo am of the ſame minde, &amp; opinione, vvith all other common Chyrurgianes that as vvell conſideringe the feſtinatione, &amp; facilitye of the operatione, as allſo the brevitye of the generatione of the cicatrice, that vve ought to doe our extirpation or ſavvinge of, of anye membre, three, or foure fingers breadth above, or vnder the ioynct, to vvitt, of the Legge, if it be vnder the knee: For allthoughe the Gangraena, or mortificatione of the Legge, vveare onlye belovv in the foreſayed Legge, &amp; the middle of the Legge as yet illaef vnhurt, &amp; ſound, vvherfor it is all vvayes better to make the ſtumpe ſhort, then longe, becauſe vvithe his length, it is aſſociated vvith a certayne deformitye, &amp; might cauſe greate impediment vnto the patiente, vvith thruſtinge of the ſame, heer agaynſte this thinge, &amp; ther agaynſte ſomvvhat els.

And then the cicatrized parte, ſhoulde be conſtraynede to reſte on the artificiall, fayned legge, as if vve extirpatede the ſame in the ioyncte: Be it therfore vvhat place you vvill chuſe, vve muſt note, that allvvayes vve rather take avvay ſome of the ſovvnde parte allſo, then leave anye of the corruptede, or mortifiede parte behinde. Becauſe that ſuch a parte of mortificatione, might allſo corrupte, &amp; mortify, the finitimate ſovvnde part, ſo that the patient, ſhould have ſuffered all the davvnger, &amp; payne in vayne, &amp; for nought, &amp; to continue his lyfe, vve ſhoulde be conſtrayned to make an other extirpatione.

Some are of minde that vve ought to ſett the patient on a ſtoole becauſe he may ſitt the faſter, &amp; convenienter: Others effect this operation, the patiēt ſittinge on the edge of a bedde, fearing leaſt he ſhould grovv faynt, or ſyncopize, &amp; might thē vvith more eaſe be gottē into his bedde &amp; reſtīg place the extirpatione beingedone..

               And as Galen findeth it goode, to ſtench the bloode, throughe actuall cauteryes, vvherby is anye corruptione, or putrefactione, in like ſorte alſoe he commendeth the ligature in the effluxione of bloode, vvherby is noe corruptione,Accorde to agree, the right vvorſhipfull Mr. Gourmelen, &amp; Mr. Pare. or anye venoumouſnes.

               If ſoe be anye of theſe accidentes chaunced, and come vnto your handes, and it ſeemed beſt vnto you, to Cauterize the Vayne, then to binde her, or els rather to binde, then to Cauterize her, and ſuch a miſchaunce, or accident happened into your handes vnexpected, and not beinge therone provided, vvithout havinge anye Cauteryes in are adines, the right vvorſhipfull Mr. Pare councelleth vs very fitlye to ſtench the bloode.

               They are alſoe differinge the one from the other in theire depthe, or ſhallovvnes: for vve neede ſomtimes to cauterize the ſkinn only, as Hippocrates vvilleth vs to doe, in the paynes of the ſhoulders: VVe muſt alſoe ſometimes cauterize the fleſhe, as in the Sciatica:Cauteryes to cauterize deepelye.

               And becauſe that amongeſt the cauteryes,Differences of the cauteryes taken out of theire actione.

               The Cauteryes are alſoe differing,Difference in numbre. in theire numbre, for at ſomtimes vve applye but one, ſomtimes tvvo, thre, four, yea alſoe fifteen at one time, as Aetius cōmandeth vs, to the curing of the vlcerations of the Breſt.
               They differ alſoe in theire manner of applicatione, for ſome are applyed alone,Differēce taken out of the manner of the applycation others in little pipes, vvhich at one ende are aperte, and opē, or have any appertiōs, or vvindovves in the ſydes therof.

               The manner howe we ought to applye theſe Cauteryes. Chap. 4.
               
                  NOvv therefore condecentlye to applye all cauteryes as vvell actuall,VVheron vve ought to conſider in the application of the Cauteryes. as Potentiall, vvithout expectinge therin anye reproche, vve muſt firſt of all cōſider, one thoſe, vvhich are able to tollerate them: In vvhat places they may be beſt ſett, and applyed: &amp; one vvhat manner vve may applye them: for commonlye, the vvithered, &amp; leane perſonnes, can not tollerate them, vnles it vveare one the heade, becauſe their bodyes, are nothing els then Membranes, Vaynes, &amp; Synnues, vvherthrough ſōtimes greate payn might be cauſed, or anye vayn, or Artery might chaū
                  ce to be through corroded, one al vvhich thinges vve muſt note, vvhen as vve muſt applye anye Cauteryes: vve muſt alſo conſider, one the nature of the Patient:Divers conſiderations. for a ſtrong groſſe bodye as a Labourers, or countrye clovvne, may farre more eaſyer tollerate, &amp; ſuffer a Cauterye, then a tender delicate bodye, or of a vvoman: nether can anye obdurate parte, as is the ſkinne of the heade, ſoe eaſylye be corroded through, as anye other ſoft or tender parte, vvherfore vve muſt houlde the Cauterye longer one the one place, then one the other. A little actuall Cautery, or a little parcell of a potētiall Cautery, vvil vvorke as forciblye, one a tender, &amp; ſofte bodye, as a great cauterye vvould doe, one a ſtrong groſſe, and obdurate bodye.
               If ſoe be, it be a replete, &amp; corpulēt bodye, or an vnhealthſame bodye, vve muſt then firſt of al Phlebotomize, or purge the ſame, becauſe in the cauterized partes ther chaūce not to come, anye concurſione of humors. VVhen vve deſire to applye anye Cauteryes, or make any Fontanelles, vve muſt conſider that vve apply them not one any ſynnuiſhe parte, nether on the endes, or beginninges, of any muſcles, nether any greate Vayne, Arterye, or Synnue.
               
                  Places vvheron vve apply the Cauteryes.VVe applye them moſt commonlye on the Heade, one the Armes, and one the legges, &amp; betvvixte all corners of the heade, for the curinge of divers diſſeaſes, vvhich heere before vve have recited, the aunciente Chyrurgiās have made theire choyſe of that place, vvhere the Sagittalle ſuture, ioyneth and vniteth her ſelfe vvith the Coronalle, vvhich place is like vnto a threfould vvay of the heade: the vvhich plaſe becauſe vve ſhould not miſſe of the ſame, is ſhevved vnto vs, of Albucaſis: To vvitt, that vve cauſe the Patient, to put forth the one of his handes,Hovv vve ſhall finde in the heade the place vvheron vve muſt applye the Cauterye. and lay the end therof, (vvhich is the vvriſte, or bē
                  dinge of the hande) one the originall, &amp; beginninge of his Noſe, betvveene both his Eyes, and thē ſtretch forth his middlemoſt, or longeſt finger, tovvardes the crovvne, or ſuperior parte of his heade, &amp; one that place vvhere as the foreſayed finger ſhall have his endīg, ther vve muſt apply the Cautery, becauſe that ther is the place vvhere the ſagitall ſuture vniteth her ſelfe vvith the Coronall ſuture: &amp; if ſo be throughe the applicatiō of this cauterye, vve deſire to doe anye vtilitye, &amp; profite, vve muſt thē ſuffer the ſame to penetrate vnto the bone: for by this meanes the bone being denudated, it vvill exfoliate, &amp; peele, through the vvhich, the apertione continueth the longer open.
               VVherfore, divers, after they have applyed the potēciall cautery, &amp; the next day follovvinge have cutt of the Eſcara, doe applye theron an actuall cautery, vvithout any daunger, as oftentimes I have ſeene to be done of Mr. Paré.
               VVe may applye alſoe cauteryes, of corroſives, in the poſterior partes of the Heade, in the end of the ſuture lambdoide, behind vnder the Eare, therthroughe to avoyde the muſcle Crotaphite: To the ſurer findinge of the vvhich place therfore, vve muſt cauſe the patiente to opē, &amp; ſhut his mouth, and ſoe to feele the motion of the ſayed muſcle. Monſr. Martel choſen, &amp; ordinarye Chyrurgian to the kinge, vvhich vvas an experte man, he applyed cauteryes behinde the Eares, in the cōcavity vvhich is ſituated behinde the little flappe of the Eare, called Fibra,
                  Cauterye in the Fibra. and that agaynſt all inveterate diſſeaſes of the Eyes, vvherof he certifyed me, to have allvvayes had ominouſe and happye ſucceſſe, vve allſoe ſometimes applye the Cauteryes in the Necke, in the hollovvnes, or concavouſnes therof, but vve muſt conſider that they doe not penetrate to deep leaſt that vve chaunce to aduſt, or corrode, the eight ſmall muſckles, of the Heade, vvhich are in this place ſituated, vvhich might cauſe daungerouſe accidentes, as I oftentimes have knovvne to chaunce.
               The moſt commoneſt novve in vſe,Meanes hovv fittlye to applye the Cauterye on the Arme. is to apply the Cauteryes, one the armes, vvhere moſt curiouſlye, &amp; vvith greate care vve muſt make electione of the place: the moſt fitteſt place is in the middeſt of the arm, tovvardes the inner ſyde therof, right betvveē the brachialle muſckle, &amp; the muſckle Biceps cloſe to the ſyde of the heade vayne. And convenientlye to make choyſe

of this place, vve muſt lay the firſt finger one that place, ſtiffelye cruſhinge the ſame, &amp; vvith the other hande, foulde &amp; ſhutt the elbovve, &amp; agayne ſtrech him out, &amp; allſo lift vp the Arme, becauſe through this motione of the Arme vve might perceave, vvhether there be noe ſynnue or Tendone ſituated thervnder, to vvitt vnder your finger, &amp; vvhether you finde in that place noe concavity, or interſtitiū of muſcles, vvhich is verye fitt, for a Peaſe or little pellet to be therine, to keepe open, &amp; apert the foreſayed Cauterye: havinge novv vvith your finger fovvnde out the moſt fitteſt place vve muſt there applye the Cauterye.Meanes hovv to apply the cauteryes convenientlye on the legge. And touchinge the ſame vvhich vve deſire to apply one the legges, the moſt cō
                  veniēteſt place ther vnto is tvvo, or thre fingers breadth belovve the knees, vvhere vve are vſed to tye our garters, vvhether it be internallye, or externallye one the legge: But thoſe that are much vſed to ride on horſebacke, &amp; alſo to cauſe better abſceſſione of humors, vvherthrough the Sciatica is cauſed, for thē it is better to apply them in the externall partes of the legges, in like ſorte alſoe for vvoemen.
               
                  Admonitione in the applycation of the actuall Cauteryes. Havinge therfore vvell, &amp; dilligentlye conſidered on the fitteſt places, and thoſe vvhich are alſo the ſureſt, you muſt thē firſt race avvay the hayre, if at the leaſt ther be any. VVhich being finiſhed, vve muſt then ſituate the Patient on a convenient place, beinge helde of ſome other perſone, if ſoe be it be needfull, &amp; thē you ſhall take your Cautery, vvhich muſt be proportioned, &amp; faſhoned according alſoe vnto that parte vvhich you intende to cauteriſe, and muſt be glovvinge, &amp; redd hott, or at the leaſt as hott as is required, becauſe your operatione may at one time be finiſhed, if it by anye meanes be poſſible, vvhich accordinge as ſhalbe required, you muſt imprint the ſame deepe, or ſhallovve in that parte, conſideringe, &amp; taking heede, that in noe ſorte you chaunce to hurte the circumiacent, or finitimate parte thervnto, to the praeventing vvherof, ther are invented, &amp; founde out divers defenſions for the foreſayed Cautery, as certayn pipes, &amp; little caſes being compoſed, and made of Iron, leaſt that vve ſhoulde chaūce to combure, the finitimate, &amp; approximate partes, vvhether it vveare throughe the faulte of the patient, or els throughe temerouſnes, &amp; timorouſnes of the Chyrurgian, as in other places vve more at large have ſpokē of, &amp; alſoe therby have placed the diſcriptione of the foreſayed Cauteryes.
               
                  For the reiterated Cauteryes.Beinge therfore neceſſary, oftentimes to reiterate the Cauterye, as in any great Gangraena, or in any Carie of legges, vve muſt then cover, the approximate places thervnto vvher vve intend to Cauterize, vvith Compreſſes, beinge madefyed in Plantine-vvater, or anye other humiditye, yea &amp; alſo veſtite the edges of the vlcerationes, vvith plaſters of Infrigidans Galeni, or els vvith ſome linnen cloutes, beinge madefyed, and dipped in anye diſtilled Aquoſityes, or vvaters.
               Novv beinge ſufficientlye Cauterized, vve muſt then by all meanes indevoure to qualifye &amp; eaſe the payne, and doloure therof, &amp; to cauſe the Eſcara to ſeparate:To eaſe the payn, and Separate the Eſcara. vvhich muſt be effected throughe anye vvarme, and moyſt remedyes, vvhich is aequallye proportioned vvith our humiditye, &amp; calidity, becauſe through the humiditye, or moyſter therof it may ſoacke through the Eſcara, and alſo the finitimate partes therof, vvhich are obdurated, &amp; drye, &amp; becauſe throughe the caliditye therof, it might ſuſcitate, and dravve vnto him, the naturalle caliditye, out of the internall partes of the body into the externall partes of the ſame, &amp; by this meanes expel that frō him vvhich is mortifyed &amp; combured. Amongſt all remedyes there is none better, thē that vvhich is made of Oyle of Egges, of inſulſed, and freſhe Butter, &amp; of Venetiane Terebebentine, addīg in the end thervnto a little poulder of Ireas, Ariſtolochiae, and a little Beanemeale, vvherthroughe alſoe all the purulente matter, vvhich hangeth therone as lime, and an Eſcara is purifyed. Some vſe a Digeſtive made of yolckes of Egges, of oyle of Roſes, &amp; of Terebītine: But that is not ſoe neceſſary, as the formeſt, becauſe it doth not ſoe califye, coagulating as the yolcke of an Egge is vvonted to doe, and alſoe immediatlye vvaxeth drye, and exſiccated.
               The potentiall Cauterye,Hovv vve muſt applye the potential Cauterye vvhich maketh an Eſcara, or ſcabbe, being as it vveare a Vicarius, of the actvall, is in this manner follovvinge applyed. VVe muſt firſt of all make a playſter, of Diacalcitheos, or ſome ſuch like, as greate as a large peece of tvvelve pence, in the middeſt vvher of vve muſt cut a little hole, as great as the nayle of ones little finger, or a little greater, accordinge to the bignes as vve deſire to have the apertione: and if you deſire to have the apertion ſomvvhat longe you muſt then alſoe make the hole in the plaſter ſomvvhat longe, &amp; then lay the ſame on that place vvhich vve deſire to open: And in the hole of the foreſayed plaſter, vvherthroughe vve perceave the ſkinn denudated, lay your potenciall Cauterye, or Corroſive, vvhether it be greate, or ſmalle accordinge as you deſire to make the apertion great, or little deepe, or ſhallovv: VVhich being done, vve muſt lay therō, a ſmalle dubbled clovte, vvhich muſt be ſōvvhat greater thē the Cautery,The cauterye maketh a farre greater Eſcara then the hole of the Plaſter. thervvith to cover the ſame, and theron as yet an other playſter, vvhich muſt be a little broader then the firſte, and one this plaſter an other cō
                  preſſe, vvhich muſt be of tvvo fingers breadthe and agayn theron an other vvhich muſt be yet greather, and then tyinge the ſame vvith a ligature, acordīg as the parte ſhal thē be requiring.
               
                  The Cauterye therfore having done his operatiō, vvhich moſt commonlye in the ſpace of tvvo hovvres is finiſhed, if ſo be the ſayed cauterye be ſtronge, &amp; violent enoughe, vve muſt as then take it of: and preſently to cauſe the Eſcara to ſeparate, vve muſt make a croſſevviſe in ſciſione therin: Other ſuffer her, of her ſelfe to ſeparate, vvithout inſciſioue: Some inſcide her rovvnde, and then lift her vp, &amp; ſo cut her looſe from vnder. But vve deſiringe through the application of a Cauterye, to make an apertiō, for the evacuating of any matter, vve muſt not onlye thē inſcide the foreſayed Eſcara, but alſo pearce ſomvvhat deeper therin, vntil ſuch time as vve have ſovvnded the matter, to give her paſſage.
               
                  Divers meanes to keepe, open a Fontanel, vvhich throughe a potentiall cauterye is made.If ſoe be the Cauterye be applyed to make a fōtanelle, vve muſt then cauſe the Eſcara throughe the ſayed remedves to ſeparate, and keep open the hole, or the foreſayed vlceratiō, as greate as the rotunditye of a bullet: to the effectuatinge of vvhich, ſome vſe a great Peaſe, vvhich throughe the great humiditye vvhervvith ſhee is ſoacked ſvvelleth as thick &amp; as bigge agayn, as ſhe vvas before, by the vvhich meanes vve may keep open the apertione, as longe as pleaſeth vs: others make little pellets of elder pithe, of Rhabarber, of Agarico, of the blacke neeſinge roote, of a Gallenut, of Gētian, &amp; ſome of goulde, or of ſylver beinge hollovve, &amp; concavoyſe, but the moſt convenient, &amp; fitteſt vvhich I have experimēted, are made of vvhyte vvaxe, amongſt the vvhich is mixed, verdegriece, Cantharides, hermodactilles, &amp; a little auripigment, adding thervnto a little piroſin.

                  Setō Properlye taken.
                  THe tranſforation, or the Seton, may in tvvo ſortes be vnderſtoode, properlye, and improperly, vve ſimplely vnderſtand it, cōſidering the threde vvhich vve dravve cleane through the ſkinne, vvith the needle, vvhich threde in aunciēt time, vvas made of, courſe hayre, as of horſehayre, or any other ſuch like, vvhich of the latiniſtes is called Seta: But vve novv a dayes make our threde of ſilcke, of Cotten,Setō improperlee vnderſtoode. or of Courſe yarne. Improperly, vve vnderſtand by the Setō, a logeſtretchinge vlceration, in anye externall parte of the body, vvhich is clean thruſt throughe the dubble ſkinne, and that throughe agilitye, and dexteritye vvith a glovvinge Cauterye.
               VVe apply eſpeciallye the tranſforatiō,In vvhat partes vve ought to apply the Seton. or the Seton, in thre partes of the body: to vvitt behinde cleane through the Necke, although ſome to follovv, the direct concurrence of the fibers, applye the ſame in the length therofe: In the Navle, and in the Scrotum, vvhen as it is full of matter, &amp; ventoſity, as it oftentimes is vvonte to happen in the Dropſye.
               This tranſforatione, is vſed, ether for any regreſſione of humoures, or for an evacuation,The vſe of the Seton. or expulſione of the ſame: For vve applyinge the foreſayed tranſforatione behinde in the necke, it then revelleth, and dravve the backe agayne thoſe humors vvhich concurre tovvardes the Eyes vvith thoſe allſoe vvhich runne tovvarde the Mouth, and the Breſt, and retayneth allſoe thoſe humours, vvhich deſcende, and ſinck, behinde in the Backebone, and in the Hippes: He beinge dravven through the Navle, or Scrotum, he then dravveth ther throughe all the Aquoſitye, and ventoſitye vvhich is therin contayned.
               It is novve adayes alſo applyed on tvvo manner of vvayes, namelye vvith Pinſers,Tvvo ſortes of applycation of the tranſforation. and vvith an actuall Cauterye, or through the Needle onlye. The tranſforation vvhich onlye is layed in the Necke, muſt be applyed betvvixt the ſeconde &amp; the third Vertebram. VVhich conveniently to effecte, vve muſt cauſe the patient to ſit on a little ſtoole, and leaſt that the tranſforatione ſhould cōpraehend more one the one ſyde then one the other vve muſt denotate a line vvith Inck in the middle of his neck, or els on the ſame parte vvher vve vvill apply the tranforatiō,Hovv vve ought to apply the tranſforation behinde throughe the necke. cauſing the patiēt to hould his heade on highe, and leene backevvardes over, becauſe therby, the ſkinne might be the looſer, and ſtretch the farther commaunding then one of the ſervantes, or ſtanders by, that vvith one of his handes he take hould one the ſkinn, cloſe by the hayre, as deep as he cā, ether according the lengthe, or thvvarte over the ſkinn, follovving the line vvhich therī is made, liftīg the ſame in the middle on highe, vvhich thē the Chyrurgian, vvith his lefte hand ſhall take hould one in the middeſt of the ſame, and elevate it, becauſe that he vvith his right hande, &amp; vvith a rounde, &amp; vvell cuttinge threded needle vvhich muſt be threded vvith a thicke threde, may thruſt cleane

throughe the ſame, the foreſayed thred beinge in this ſorte thruſt therthroughe vve muſt cutt him of cloſe to the Needle.The tranſforation vvith an actuall Cautery. But if rather you deſired, to effecte the foreſayed transforatione vvith a hott Iron, the ſkinne beinge lift vp on both ſydes, through ſome ſervant, or through the Chyrurgiane vvith his Pinſers, vvhich he muſt houlde faſt in his left hande, dilligentlye conſideringe leaſt he take houlde thervvith of anye Muſcles of the Necke, vvhich are ſituated vnder the foreſayed ſkinne, as to that purpoſe, &amp; intent he muſt cauſe the Patient to bende his necke, hould his heade vp, or on highe, &amp; right by this meanes to knovve, vvhether anye of the foreſayed, Muſcles are compraehended of the Pinſers or not. VVhich beinge done the Chyrurgyane muſt nipe, &amp; ſhut cloſe together the foreſayed pinſers theron applyed, therby to benumme &amp; diſſipate the ſenſes &amp; feelīg vvhich through the hott iron might be cauſed, &amp; as thē vvith a triāgled glovving cautery thruſt throughe the hole of the pinſers &amp; ſoe throughe the elevated ſkinne alſoe: The vvhich foreſayed ſkinne being in this ſorte perforated, &amp; immediatlye agayn being dravven therout, vvithout ſuffering the ſkinn to fal, vve muſt thruſt throughe the perforatione, a needle vvith a thicke dubble threede vvhich threde muſt be ſoacked in the remedyes above rehearſed for the Cauteryes, or els at the leaſte being made fatt in ſome Digeſtive, &amp; then the ſayed threde being diſſected, and cutt of, vve muſt ſuffer him to remayne therin, as is above rehearſed, &amp; applye therone a Playſter of Refrigerans Galeni, for the firſt or ſeconde daye, and then a Playſter of Betonica.
               
               This foreſayed threde, or Seton, vve muſt ſuffer it to continue therin, as longe as it ſhalbe needfull, as vve have ſayed of the Fontanelles.
               As concerninge the tranſforation,A tranſforation applyed in the Scrotum. vvhich in the navle, or in the Scrotū
                   may be applyed it vvil be ſufficient vvhen vve take the Scrotum, &amp; the extreameſt end of the navle, &amp; ſo perforate the ſkinn being doubled, vvith a reaſonable greate or groſſe needle, vvhich muſt be threded vvith a vvoollen, cotten, or ſilcke thred, and applyinge therone, the ſelfe ſame remedyes, of the vvhich vve have in the tranſforatione of the necke rehearſed.

                  Matter of the Ligamentes.Thoſe Ligamētes accordinge to the affirmations of aunciēt Chyrurgiās, are of divers matter, as of Linnen, vvoolle, or Lether: the linnen Ligamentes are the moſt commoneſt of all the other, vvhich at that time they vſed, vvhen as they vvoulde ſtifflye compreſſe, &amp; bringe cloſe together anye parte: they vſed vvoollen rovvlers, in the fractures vvith vvoundes, gentlye in that ſort to retayne together the broken bones, &amp; to cauſe noe payne, or inflammatione at all. Hippocrates vſed the Ligamentes of lether,Hippocrates. in the fractures of the Noſe, &amp; the nethermoſt chavv bone: But of vvhat matter ſoever vve make thē they muſt not be too much vvorne out, becauſe that they may be ſtrōge enough, to be dravvn cloſe together, &amp; ſtretche ſtifflye out: Farther more they muſt be even and ſmoothe, nether muſt they have any ſilvages, nether muſt it have anye harde ſeames, &amp; muſt be cut aright the threde, accordinge the length of the linnen, &amp; not cōtradictorily: becauſe they may tye ſmoothe and evenlye, vvithout the one ſyde beinge hardre tyed then the other, as oftentimes it chaunceth, vvhen the rovvler is cutt contradictorryelye: It is right trevve, that the ligature vvhervvithe after Phlebotomye vve tye the arme, yeeldeth it ſelfe better beinge ſo cutt, but it chaunceth heerin, becauſe in that place it yeeldeth it ſelfe better for the bending of the arme.
               Touching their qvallity, they muſt be cleane &amp; vvhyte, leaſte that throughe their impuritye they be a hinderance, or interruption vnto the parte, &amp; becauſe by that meanes they may the better receave the humidityes, as Oxicrate, &amp; vvyne, or any ſuch like, vvherin vve chaunce to madifye, &amp; vvett them. They muſt allſo be fine &amp; light becauſe throughe their ponderouſnes, they doe not overburthen the parte, ſuſcitate, &amp; provoke payne, &amp; cauſe inflāmation. Thirdly they muſt be ſofte, &amp; flexible becauſe through the obduratnes therof, they might chaunce to hurte that parte. Fourthlye, of līnen, vvhich muſt be verye vvhyte, &amp; not to cloſely vveaved becauſe ſo they ar more better to be placede, &amp; the matter, &amp; the evaporationes might the eaſier therthroughe tranſpire, vvhich being therin occluded, cauſe inflāmatione, &amp; itchinge.
               
                  Forme &amp; figure of the Ligamentes.Concerning their forme, &amp; figure, vve muſte knovve, that theſe foreſaede Ligamentes, or rovvlers, are ether rovvled vp, or involved, ſī
                  plelye, or dubblelye, vnto the middeſt of the foreſayed ligature &amp; of an aeqvalle latitude in all places, as are thoſe vvhich vve vſe in the fractures of the Armes, Hippes, &amp; Legges: In like ſorte allſo in the vvoundes, &amp; vlcerations of the ſame partes. The dubble ligament or rovvler is ether of on peece of linnen, on the endes beinge diverſelye cutte, or on an other place, in other endes, as are the ligamēts of the Head, vvhich are cutte into foure, or ſixe endes: And in foure endes for the Scrotum: Or in the ligament, vvhich is ſovved together, &amp; made of divers peeces, as are thoſe vvhich are vſed for the flancks, for the Breſtes, for the Teſticles, &amp; for the Fundament, &amp; that eſpeciallye vve deſirīge to ſpare, &amp; be chairye of the linnen. And as much as concerneth their longitude, &amp; latitud that coſiſteth on the conſideratione, &amp; iudgement of the Chyrurgiane, vvhich before hand muſt ſee the figure, &amp; knovve it, &amp; muſt therby allſo be able to knovve, the conformatione, &amp; ſitvatione of the parte, &amp; the diverſitye of the diſſeaſe: for vvhen as vve are vrgede to make a greate circumvolutione, vve muſt then conſider on the length, &amp; make it as long as is reqvired: cōſideringe the breadth, vve muſt make thē accordinge to the longitude, &amp; latitude of the diſſeaſe,The Ligamēt muſt bē broader then the diſſeaſe. ſo that the foreſayde ligament muſt be greater thē the diſſeaſe, becauſe vvith on circū
                  volutione doe not onlye involve the vvounde but allſo both the endes therof as vvell on the one ſyde as the other: for if ſo be the ligamente vveare ſmalle, he muſt thē cruſhe the diſſeaſe, vvherthrough greate payne, and inflammatione might becauſede.

For as the one man is groſſer &amp; more corpulent then the other, ſo ther are alſo diſſeaſes, vvherof the one is more paynfull then the other, vvherfore vve muſte conſider, that the ligament be nether too ſtifly nor looſely tyed, for all ligatures vvhich are too ſtiflye bovvnde, cauſe payne, &amp; concurſione of humors, vvith inflāmations, yea &amp; ſomtimes allſo a Gangraena: And thoſe ligamentes vvhich are too looſe, they are profitable for nothinge, &amp; cauſe that the reſtauratede partes, vvhich are ſitvatede, move therout, as the broken Legges &amp; the diſlocatede membres, yea &amp; allſo the lippes of the vvoundes vvhich are inſertede, and brought together throughe the looſe ligature doe agayne ſeparate the one from the other. And finallye in one vvorde to conclude, the mediocritye of ligatione, is a greate ſolace, and comforte to the Patient, as he vvill then vvith his ovvne mouth teſtifye.
               VVe muſt note that all ligatures muſte not in a vvoūd ſo faſte be ligatede,Wherone in Ligatione vve ought to conſider. as in a Fracture &amp; leſſe in a Fracture vvhich is vvithout a vvounde, then in a ſimple vvounde: VVe muſt allſo harder, &amp; more violenter binde &amp; ligate on the vulneratede parte, &amp; one the fracture, thē on any of the approximate, &amp; nexte adioynīg partes, therby to repell, &amp; drive back agayn the humors, vvhich doe theron ſinck and allſo

cruſhe out, thoſe vvhich are ſuncke into the finitimate partes, vvhich is leaſte ſhutte: for in ſo doinge, vve keepe thoſe partes occludede, &amp; liberate, &amp; free from all inflammations. Farther more in the end of the ligatione vve eſpye a tē
                  der tumefactione, out of vvhich vve may iudge that the parte is reaſonablye ſhutte: if ſo be the tumor be harde, &amp; obduratede, &amp; blackiſhe, it is then a ſigne that the parte is too ſtiflye tyed. And vvheras at all vve perceave anye tumefaction, it is a ſigne that the ligament is too looſelye tyede.

                  The ſecōd ſorte of Ligament.The ſeconde ligament, is that vvhich is ordaynede, not onlye becauſe of it ſelfe it is commodiouſe, &amp; profitable, but Per accidens, &amp; bye chaunce, &amp; it is but onlye vſed, to contayne, &amp; keepe the remedyes, &amp; compreſſes, on the diſſeaſede parte, as on a great, &amp; dolorouſe inflammatione, on a greate Apoſtematione, or on any other dolorouſe parte.
               
                  Rediviſiō of the firſt kind of Ligature.And touchinge the ligature vvhich of it ſelfe is profitable, &amp; commodiouſe, ther of ther are tvvo kindes, vvhich of the vſe, vvher vnto they are ordaynede, are taken: vvhich is ether to cō

               The incarnative or conglutinating ligation,Icarnative Ligament. is commōly vſed in this form on the vvounds. To vvitt, that vve roule vp the rovvler, or ligature on both his endes, vnto the middeſt therof, vvherof in each hāde vve muſt take the one end beinge rovvled vp: laying that parte of the ligamēt vvhich is not rovvled vp, on the other ſyde of the vvounde, reducinge both the endes of the ligatione, vvhich vve have in our hands above on the vvounde, that ther throughe, vve might adioyne, &amp; bringe together, the ſeparated partes, &amp; lippes of the vvounde, croſſinge the foreſayed ligature, in forme of a Burgundiane croſſe, or in forme as in the margine is ſet dovvne vnto you: Then vve muſt reduce both the endes to the parte, bringinge one end, tovvardes the ſuperiour parte of the membre, becauſe therby the fluxione may be praevented, &amp; the other end, on the inferior parte, that the bloode therthrough, vvhich is ſuncke, and diſcended into that parte, might be depreſſed, and cruſhed out: and the fore ſayed Ligature muſt be of ſuch a breadthe, that vvhen as he is rovvled vp, &amp; applyed on the vvounded parte, may not onlye compraehende the vvounde but alſoe both the endes, of the ſame.
               If ſoe be the vvoūde vveare ample, &amp; greate, and the ligature, cōſidering his latitude,Nota. coulde not be accommodated, vve muſt as then compraehende but the one halfe of the vvounde, &amp; the other halfe therafter.

               As farre forth therfore, as if that parte be rugged, and vnſmoothe, as is that Legge, vvhich is farre more thicker in the Calfe therof, then in the lovvermoſt partes therof, vve muſt thē frō palme, to Palmebreadthe, a little more thē half throughe cutt the ſame, and fovvlde both ſydes cōtradictorilye the one to the other, &amp; ſoe looſlye ſovve the ſame, by vvhich meanes the ſayed Ligament, is made to be recurvated, and croockedlye vvounde, like a Bovve.

                  ❧How we ſhall dreſſe the broken Armes, hippes, and legges. Chap. 5.
               
                  Our mā
                     ner of dreſſinge of al brokē legges may be aſſimilated, and compated, vvith the manner of the auncient Chyrurgianes.
                  AL thoughe that our common practiſe, of the dreſſinge of all broken Legges, ſeemeth to be alienate, and to differ, from the manner of doinge, of the antique, &amp; auncient profeſſors, &amp; Chyrurgiās, it is notvvithſtanding in ſuch ſorte, that vve eaſyly can compare them together. All the auncient phyſitions, &amp; Chyrurgianes, have binne of opiniō that in the Fractures vve ought to vſe a dubble kinde of Ligament: Namelye inferiore ligamentes, vvhich they called Hypodeſmidas, &amp; ſuperior ligatures, vvhich they called Hypodeſmous: they have theſe names becauſe of their ſituatione, becauſe ſome of them are tyed, and bovvnd vnder &amp; ſome agayn above. And as touchinge the inferioure ligamētes, Hippocrates maketh mention of tvvo ſortes.
               
                  Tvvo ſortes of inferior, or vnderligamētes.VVherof the firſt, &amp; the ſhorteſt, beginneth one the fracture, layinge alvvayes the one end contradictorilye therone becauſe it ſhould not vvholy lye, on the place of the payn, vvhich ligament muſt be tyed round about the fracture, &amp; then be reduced vpvvardes, vvhere he as thē endeth: This ligament muſt cloſelye be vvounde together, becauſe ſo the fluxiō, vvhich might chaūce to ſincke into the diſſeaſed parte, might the better be kept therout. The ſeconde ligament, vvhich allmoſt, muſt be as longe agayne as the firſt, is allſo begunne one the ſame manner, to vvitt, on the fracture, layinge onlye therone, a turne, or tvvo, vvinding dovvnevvardes, to cruſhe therout the bloode vvhich might chaunce to ſincke into the fracture, vvith circumvolutiōs, vvhich muſt be layed a little more a parte the one frō the other, then in the firſt ligament they vveare: for vve muſt take heede of makinge to greate expreſſiones of bloode, in the endes of the Armes, or legges, that vvithout imflammatiō they can not receave much therof, and the ligament being come dovvne, muſt vvinde the ſame vpvvardes agayne, to come agayn to that place vvher vve did beginn, becauſe both theſe ligamentes might hould faſt, and the muſcles be brought into theire naturall ſituation, vvhich through the tvvo formoſt ligationes might be brought therout.
               
                  Subdiviſiō of the ſeconde inferior ligature.Other auncient Chyrurgianes make of this nethermoſt ligature, tvvo ligationes, vvherof the one is the ſureſt the ſeconde for the fractures, vvhich beginneth one the brokē parte: having therafter, made one, or tvvo circumvolutiones, then is the foreſaved ligature reduced dovvnevvardes. The other vvhich may be the thirde for the fractures, muſt be begunne, on the beginning of the parte, endinge ſupernally vvher the firſt ligatiō is ended paſſing over the Fracture: Soe that they impoſe therone thre ligationes all vvhich three vve may call inferior ligamētes. The firſt vvhich aſcendeth from the fracture one highe, as from the middle of the legge tovvarde the knee. The ſeconde vvhich deſcēdeth from the fracture dovvnevvardes, as from the middle of the legg tovvardes the foote. The third, vvhich from the extreameſte part of the Ioyncte, aſcendeth ſuperiorlye as frō the the ſoule of the foote tovvardes the knees.
               But novveadayes &amp; folovving our common practiſe,An aſtringent plaſter on the fracture. vvhich vve vſe before theſe three ligamentes, vve applye firſt of all, one the place of the fracture an aſtringent Plaſter, vvhich is made of Bolus, of flovver, or volatill meale, of vvhytes of Egges, of Oyle of Roſes &amp; of a little Terebentine, (in ſteade of Cerotū Galeni, vvhich the aunciēt Chyrurgians vſed:) After the firſt dreſſing vve vſe the Plaſter of Diacalcitheos, or of Diapalma, liquefacted in oyle of Roſes, vvith vineger. The ligature novv being decētly vvoūd, becauſe the legges, the hippes &amp; the Armes, are thinner belovve then above they are, vve muſt therfore one ſuch ſlendernes apply ſome certayn cōpreſſes becauſe the foreſayed ioyncte may be in all places of an aequall craſſitude, &amp; thickenes, &amp; the ſplinter, vvhich muſt be made of ſtiffe paper, of lattinn, or of any other ſubſtance, be verye evenlye, &amp; ſmoothlye applyed therone, &amp; tyed vnder the inferior ligatures, or rovvlers.
               Theſe ſplinters muſt be three in numbre, vvhich muſt be excavated like a gutter, vvherof the firſt muſt be a little broader, then the other to by applyed vnder the fracture, &amp; to compraehende all that, vvhich is belovve the fracture, &amp; be as it vveare a fundament, or foundatiō thervnto. The other tvvo one both the ſydes of the fracture, being ſomvvhat ſeparated the one frō the other, leaſt that in the ligatiō they chaūced to glide the one over the other. They muſt alſo be of ſuch a longitude, as the broken parte requireth.
               Theſe thre foreſayed ſplintes being thus impoſed, one the inferior rovvlers,Applycatione of the inferior Ligatures. vve muſt then tye the fracture that it may lye faſt and ſteadye &amp; the part be cōtayned in a goode quallitye &amp; diſpoſione. VVith the firſt of theſe tvvo ligatures, vve muſt beginn, at the extreameſt parte of the membre, frō vnder vpvvardes. The ſeconde muſt beginn frō above &amp; end belovv: vve muſt allſoe note that the one of thoſe rovvlers, muſt take his beginninge internally in the membre, &amp; muſt proceed from the left to the right ſyde, becauſ they may croſſe the one over the other, in ſuch a forme as in the margine you may ſee, or in forme of a St. Andrevves Croſſe, becauſe it may be involved verye cloſelye theron.
               
                  It ſeemeth that Hippocrates hath vſed noe other ligature, in the Fractures vvith vvounde, but that he rovvled the ſame ſomvvhat looſe.

               Of the ſituation, and of the conſtitutione or collocatione of thoſe partes, one the which the forſayed Operatione muſt be effected. Chap. 5.
               
                  NOe man is ignorāt, hovv neceſſarye, &amp; requiſite theſe operationes are, to the reſanatiō, of the diſſeaſes, vvhervvith mās body is daylye, &amp; continually oppugned &amp; opreſſed: and indeed, this operation ſhoulde in vayn be vſed, if ſo be that not onlye the vvhole body, but alſo the forſayed diſſeaſed partes, vvherō vve effecte our Operation, vveare not therafter, conſtituted &amp; ſituated, and vvith moſt convenience collocated.
               Therfore decentlye, &amp; vvith moſt couvenience to collocate the ſame,Vitilitye in conſtitution of the parte. the Patiēt muſt firſt of all lye on his bedde, (if ſoe be at the leaſt the magnitude, and largenes of the diſſeaſe require the ſame,) &amp; that in ſuch a form, that the vvoū
                  ded, or vulnerated parte; may be vvith moſt eaſe, &amp; cōveniēce collocated, as it is reqviſite, for they are not al together ſituated in one faſhō, &amp; manner: It is right true, that there are ſome certayne rules, as are in the ligatures, vvhich muſt only be vſed one diſſeaſes.
               Firſt of al therfore, &amp; generally,Thre thinges to be cōſidered in the collocatiō of a parte, or membre. to collocate &amp; rightlye ſituate al vvounded partes, vve muſt conſider thre eſpeciall thinges: to vvitt, that the ſituation, be Softe, Smooth &amp; Highe: Softe, becauſe a hard ſituatiō, ſomtimes might chaunce to diſturbe, and irrequiate, not only the vulnerated part, but alſo the approximate partes ther vnto, by the vvhich meanes great payn, inflammation, &amp; conſequentlye alſo an attractione, &amp; a fluxion muſt neceſſarily follovve in that parte: &amp; vvhich is more, the Patient is conſtrayned not being able to tollerate the obdurate collocatiō, to eaſe and yeelde ſolace to that parte, by oftentimes turninge, and revertinge of himſelfe, vvhich is very vnprofitable for him, becauſe that parte, requireth nothinge els then quietude, vvithout beinge much diſturbed, and moleſted.
               Even, and ſmooth, becavſe that the vnevē,Playn, &amp; ſmoothe ſituation. &amp; implanitude collocation, inferreth payn &amp; recurvatiō in the Ioyncte, to vvitt, the one parte reſting on ſomvvhat, &amp; the other parte, dependinge vvithout reſtinge one anye thinge.
               On Highe, becauſe that therbye,Highe ſituatione. al concurſione of humors is praevented, vvhich othervviſe through the lovv ſituatiō of the Iovncte, might be therthervvardes dravvne.
               Conſidering this occaſion, have the Chyrurgians alvvayes cauſed the broken or vvounded Arme to be dependently vvorne one the breſte &amp; the legg to be collocated on highe, to vvit ſō
                  vvhat higher then the bodye, the Patient lyinge on bedde, becauſe he may nether be erected, nor ſitt.
               Nether is it onlye neceſſarye that the membre, or parte be collocated ſoftlye, ſmoothly,The aperon of a vvound muſt all vvayes be recurvated dovvnevvardes if it be poſſible. &amp; highlye, but it is alſo requiſite, (if ſoe be ther be anye vvounde, or vlceration, vvhich eſpecially is fiſtulouſe) that the apertiō therof, if ſo be it is poſſible, recurvate it ſelfe dovvnevvardes, becauſe that the matter, might have the liberater a paſſage, to enter forth at, vvithout makinge any greater cōcavityes, &amp; doe not chaunce to incēce, or inflame the approximate partes, nether to corrode them, vvhich vvould bringe vvith it divers, &amp; ſundry accidentes: &amp; praepoſterate the reſanatione of the ſame.
               Secondarilye,The ſituatione of the Ioyncte muſt be naturall, &amp; accuſtomed. the Ioyncte muſt be ſituated in ſuch a forme, and faſhone, vvhich is agreinge vvith the naturalle diſpoſione of the Ioyncte, and alienated from all payne: vvhich tvvo obſervationes, are vvell agreinge the one vvith the other: For all faſhons vvhich cauſe noe payne, that is the naturalle, and accuſtomed figure, and collocatione therof: Euen as the

paynefull, and vnnaccuſtomed figure is agaynſt nature, ſo that the naturall, and accuſtomed figure, or faſhō, is vvholy vvithout payn: vvhich happeninge, the Patient muſt a longe continuance keepe his Ioyncte in that beinge, becauſe ſoe he ſhall feele noe, or at the leaſt verye ſmall payne at all vvhich is verye cōmodiouſe, to the reſanation of all vvoundes, vlceratiōs, Fractures &amp; alſo for all diſlocatiōs, as it is in like ſort profitable for all other diſſeaſes vvhatſoever,
               The aunciente Chyrurgians, have called, this forme of ſituatione, the right and true collocatione, becauſe all the Vaynes, Arteryes, Synnues, &amp; muſcles, as then are right, nether are they extended, nether lye they recurved.
               
                  The natural ſituatiō vvhich of the aū
                     cient profeſſors, is called the right ſituation.And althoughe that the Arme have binn anglevvyſe collocated, notvvithſtāding vve eſteeme it as then to lye right, becauſe that all the foreſayed partes, are accounted to lye right, &amp; not extended, nether recurved, &amp; that this collocation of the Arme is naturalle, as heere after vve vvill more largelye ſpeake of.
               
                  An example of the ſituatiō of any diſſeaſed part.And by degrees to ſpecifye, the ſituatione of each, &amp; ſundry parte, vve vvil heere diſcribe ſome of them for an example: vvhē as ther is any vvounde, Apoſtemation, or diſlocation in any Ioyncte, vve muſt then vvith all dilligence note the ſituation there of: for through a badde ſituatione, not onlye immediatly are cauſed many accidentes, but after the ſanatione therof, the Ioynct ſometimes tarryeth right out extended, vvhich ought to have binne croocked, or els abideth croocked vvher it oughte to be extēded or els combineth it ſelfe, &amp; ioyneth vvith ſome other thinge, vvhich ought to have binn ſeparated, &amp; ſeioyncte.An excellent obſervation VVherfore if the vvounde be in the vppermoſt parte of the ſhoulder, vve muſt then impoſe vnder the Armepites of the Patient, a great linnē balle, &amp; hange the arme one the Breſt, &amp; ſomvvhat beare, out his elbovve, becauſe that the heade of the arme, may be ſomvvhat elevated, &amp; the ſeparated partes, may agayne be inſerted the one vvith the other and ſo much the better be cured together agayne: The contrarye vvherof muſt be obſerved, if ſoe be that in the inferior parte be anye vvounde, as vnder the Armepittes: for the vvound beinge cured, &amp; vve doe not lift vp ſomtimes, the Arme &amp; let him fall dovvne agayn, &amp; ſtirre him othervvayes, vvithout cauſinge any payne, and that the Arme is not helde from the Breſte, the Patient therafter, becauſe of the Cicatrice ſhall not be able to lift vp his Arme becauſe through the ſame the Arme is grovven ſtiffe. As therof vve have an example, exemplifyed vnto vs of the throte, &amp; in the Necke alſo of many and divers, vvhich beinge vvounded, or burned, the cicatrice hath remayned ſo obdurated, that they ther through have ether helde their Heades, to much on high or to much ſtoupinge, or hāging backvvarde, or to much dependinge ether on the right, or one the Leftſyde.
               If ſo be that ther be an Apoſtemation,The anglevvyſe figure, is the naturall forme of the Arme. in the Elbovve, or els that the ſame be diſlocated, or vvounded, vve muſt thē ſituat the Elbovve angle, or cornervvyſe: for ſuch aforme is very neceſſarye for the ſame, &amp; natural, &amp; accuſtomed vnto hī: &amp; although, the cornervvyſe figure is that vvhich maketh an accute corner, notvvithſtāding vve meane therby through the anguled figure▪ vvith the auncient Chyrurgians, that vvhich hath his corner right but yet not ſo cleane, and vvholy erected, but that vvhich attaygneth ſomvvhat tovvard the rectitude, ſo that it commeth ſomvvhat bluntlye, and ſuch a figure is not as yet truelye the meane, betvveene the inflexione, and the extenſione, but is the ſame vvhich yeeldeth her ſelfe, tovvarde the extenſione: If ſoe be the Arme be inſerted and combined, vvith being able to be recurved, or extēded vve may yet as then better, and vvith more facilitye helpe him ſelfe, then if he vveare vvholye recurved, or vvholye extended.
               VVe may alſoe obſerve the ſame in the hande,The hand muſt be ſhutt. for vve muſt keepe the fingers ſhutt, &amp; halfe bended, and if ſoe be the diſſeaſe vveare in one finger only, it vveare then better that the ſame continued ether inflected, or incurved, thē that he vveare ſtrayght, for the property of the hande is to gripe and take houlde, the vvhich ſhee can not effecte, and bringe to paſſe, then throughe the recurvatione of the ſame.
               If ſoe be above in the Hippe ther chaunce to come, an Apoſtemation, or vvovnde,The hippe muſt be ſtirred. vve muſt then in the conſolidatinge of the ſame, obſerve that vvhich in the ſhoulder vve have ſeene, as beinge neceſſarye to ſtirre the foreſayed parte, on divers faſhons, becauſe the heade of the bone, doe not inſert it ſelfe, and grovve faſt in the panne.
               VVe obſerve in the Ioyncture of the knees the contrarye, for if ſo be,The legge muſt be kept right. that ther be a vvounde, or an Apoſtemation, or els in the finitimate parte, the Patiēt muſt thē hould his legge right, vvithout havinge the heeles dravven in tovvardes his buttockes, as it in divers perſons happeneth, and that to the hinderance of the Patientes, vvhen they are cured.
               And vve muſt dilligentlye note, that the legge be collocated as right, as is poſſible, and if ſo be by chaunce it laye recurved, vve muſt then as gentlelye, as is poſſible ſtretche and extende the ſame agayne, othervvyſe the patient beinge cured, might chaunce to be mutilate, and vvithout greate indecorū, or deformity ſhould not be able to goe, as vve have knovvene the ſame to happē vnto tvvo great perſonages, of our times.
               Novv as concerninge the foote, &amp; the Toes, they muſt allſoe be extended, and not recurved,

or inflected, as vve have ſpoken of the hād, &amp; fingers:Diſcommoditye of having the Legge croocked For if ſoe be they cōtinued ſoe croocked, the bodye as then ſhoulde not be able to reſt, or ſtayede theron: Soe that the ſituation of the Arme, is cōtrarye to the Hande, to the Legge, and to the Foote: becauſe the one muſt be recurvede, or croocked, and the other extended right out.

And ſometimes alſoe it procedeth out of the Liver, of the Milte, of the Hemorrhodes, and ſometimes alſo out of ſome great vaynes, and out of other partes, yea and alſo out of the vvhole habitude of the bodye: All vvhich differēces, muſt throughe their ovvne ſignes be knovvne, becauſe the reſanatione of the ſame may be the ſurer.
            As for example it happeneth commonlye,Thoſe vvhich are deprived of anye Ioyncte, are very ſubiecte vnto the Bloodyflixe. throughe anye greate ſuperfluitye of bleeding, in thoſe vvhich have loſt an Arme, or a legge, that on certayne times they have the bloodyeflixe▪ In vvhich kinde of Myſenteria, vve neede not much to feare, nether neede vve to vſe thoſe remedyes heervnder diſcribed: But muſt reſtraygne ſuch Patientes, from great comeſtiones, and ſuperfluouſe drinckinge of VVyne, and cauſe him to be vvell phlebotomiſed: vvherof vve in this place endevoure to advertice,

and inſtructe the yonge Chyrurgiane, becauſe that vvithout making any great delaye, he might be adiuvable &amp; helpefull to the patient vvith theſe remedyes vvhich conſequently follovve: the vvhich in paſſinge by, it ſeemed convenient vnto me to rehearſe: Becauſe it is not my intent, in this place, onlye to ſpeake, of the improper Dyſenteria, &amp; curatione therof, but of the true, &amp; proper bloodyeflixe, or Dyſenteria, vvhich in all Leagers is common, &amp; familiare, and infectiouſe.
            The impure Bloodyeflixe, is the trueſt, &amp; aſſuredſt, and is aſſimilated vnto vvater, vvherin nue ſlaughtered fleſhe, hath binn vvaſhed: the vvaterye Bloodyeflixe,Fluxus Hepaticus. is called Fluxus Hepaticus, the Liver laſke, vvhich is cauſed, throughe the imbicillitye, of the retentive forces of the liver, through the vvhich the vitall ſpirites &amp; the naturalle calliditye doe exhalate, &amp; the perſonne, is vvholye bereft of all his forces &amp; therthroughe alſo the ſtomacke is feebled, that it can not any more compraehend, any meate, or drincke, to feede one, nether digeſt the ſame, ſoe that by this meanes the vvhole bodye conſumeth and vvithereth.
            The black, heavye, &amp; thick bloodyeflixe, proceedeth eſpecially out of the Milte, vvhich is, as it vveare a Poole, or receptacte, of al melancholicke, thicke, and blackebloode.
            
               Dyſenteria properlye taken.But that vvhich properly, or vprightly is called Dyſenteria, or Bloodyeflixe, that is a commō vlceration of the entralles, out of vvhich firſt of all the viſcoſitye of the ſame is driven, &amp; expelled out, then the Axvngiouſenes therofe, vvith a little redde blood intermingled: Thirdly, the internalle membrane of the inteſtines, of the vvhich the pellicles, and the little fibres are in the ſtooles ſeen, thervnder to be mixed: finallye the vlcerrtiō as yet proceeding, &amp; more, &amp; more grovving vvorſe, as thē conſequently follovveth the carnoſitye, &amp; the verye ſubſtance, of the corroded, &amp; corrupted guttes: all vvhich kī

            The occaſione of the bloodyeflixe is the venoumouſe puiſſance and force,Occaſion &amp; cauſe of the Dyſenteria.

The humors are alſo irritated, and provoacked, through cauſticke and venoumouſe medicamentes, as throughe the Coloquintida Scammonia, or throughe the Sublimated poulder of a Diamante.Ravve fruicte cauſeth the Bloodyflixe. Alſo through anye viciouſe, acute groſſe cibaryes and thoſe vvhich are apte vnto corruptione, or els is not ſufficientlye dreſſed: Alſoe throughe any fruicte, as by cherryes, Blackecherryes, Plumbes, Peatches, Coucoumbres, Milions, &amp; ſuch like, vvhich vve call Hotatij Fructus, vvhich more, throughe the conſtitutione of the ayre, vvhich ether is to moyſte, and pluviouſe, or raynye, to coulde, or to hott, in others through intemperature, and other inordinate victitatione, or debacchatione, by the vvhich it inſeparablelye happeneth as vvell in the VVinter, as in the Summer, that this diſſeaſe of the bloodyeflixe, afflicteth man kinde.
            It is right true, that this diſſeaſe,Indicati

                   hovv vve may eaſilye, or difficultlye attayn to the Bloodyeflixe. oftentimes reagneth in the Prime, or vernall time of the yeare, and eſpecially in the Harveſt, or Autumne, in the vvhich time the humors, doe moſt impeach, &amp; hurt vs vvith the qvallityes. Havinge obſerved all theſe thinges, vve muſt conſider one the quantitye and quallitye of the

diſſeaſe, as on the greatnes of the vlceratiō, and the ſuperfluitye of bloode, and one the greate corroſione, and one the violence of the diſſeaſe, therbye to iudge, vvhether the diſſeaſe vvith anye facilitye, difficulty, or impoſſibilitye may be repelled, and cured.
            VVe eſteeme the cure of the Dyſenterya to be of more facilitye, the ſame beinge in the great guttes, or inteſtines Caecum, Colon, &amp; Rectum, thē it being in the ſmalle entralles, Duodenum, Ieiunum and Ileum.
            
            VVe take alſo the ſame to be leſſe daungerouſe, in yonge perſons, and in the men, then in yonge children, and vvoemen.
            In a longevalle, or longe continuing Dyſenterye, it is a badde ſigne vvhē the appetite is departed, &amp; yet a farre more vvorſe ſigne, vvhē as ther are aſſociated vnto the ſame Agues, or Imflammationes.
            
               They vvhich are of moſt experiēce may iudge of this poyncte.As is that vvhich is cauſed, out of anye Apoſtemation, beinge burſt out of the Liver, or of the Milte, vvhich verye rarelye happeneth, and yet more rare out of the pulmonicalle Apoſtemationes, vvherof the matter diſgorgeth it ſelfe in the left ventricle of the Harte, and ſoe into the Artery called Aorta, the truncke, or body of all other Arteryes, frō thence into the Vaynes of the Meſentery, vvhich are extēded to the entralles, the vvhich paſſage or vvay vve can not then throughe imagination compraehend, and vvhich is very obſcure. And if ſoe be ther follovved any peculiare thinge therout, beſides the cauſticke, and venoumouſe matter it might thē inferre fearefull, &amp; daungerouſe accidentes, to the hart of the Patiēt, (vvhich is the vvelſpring of lyfe) &amp; the onlye originall, of vitall ſpirites, vvhich are diffuſed over the vvhole body, &amp; are occaſione of the actione, motione, &amp; alſo all other agilityes of the bodye.
            The evomitiō of the choloricke humors, in the beginning of the diſſeaſe, doe beare vvitnes alſoe of the daunger follovvinge.
            The bloody flixe, vvhich is cauſed out of any melācholicke humors, is eſteemed to be vvithout anye hope.
            The convulſiō of ſynnues, the Hickough, &amp; the parbraking, are forerunners, &amp; as it vveare, embaſſadoures of death.
            In like ſorte allſoe vvhen vve eſpye, a blacke ſpott behinde the left eare, as bigge as a Vetche, vvherbye is great alteratione, that allſo is a ſigne of Death, as Hippocrates vvithneſſeth vnto vs. If ſoe be this diſſeaſe, through negligē

            This therfor is the cauſe, or occaſiō, the ſpecies, &amp; kindes of this diſſeaſe, &amp; the afflicted, &amp; opreſſed parte beinge aperte, and knovvne, vve muſt novv proceede to the reſanatione of the ſame.
            The finall end of the curatione, is ether generalle, or ſpecialle.
            The generall end is to be noted, ether on the diſſeaſe, or on the Phyſitione, as on both the eſpecialliſt, &amp; moſt principall perſonages, vvhich acte and ſett forth the Hiſtorye of this diſſeaſe. In all the kindes of Dyſenteria,
               Cure of the Dyſenteria. the patient muſt keepe himſelfe repoſed, and quiet, becauſe all vlcerationes, deſire to be quietlye kepte, and in eaſe: Notvvithſtandinge, Hippocrates in his third boocke de Diaeta councelleth, that vve ſhoulde cauſe the Patient vvhich hath the bloodye flixe to vvalke, &amp; alſoe cauſe him to ſtirre his bodye, vvherby he meaneth, that vve ought to doe the ſame, before the foreſayed Dyſenteria become, &amp; becauſe of the Prophylactica, therthroughe to prevent, the procreatiō of all badde humors, &amp; to defend the ſame out of the inteſtines, &amp; cauſe them to vvithdravve themſelves into other externall partes of the bodye.
            Farthermore the patient muſt allvvayes retayne his ſtooles as longe as he poſſibly may or can, vvithout conſtraygninge himſelfe thervnto,
            The Chyrurgian muſt firſt of al conſider on the vſe of the aſtringent medicamentes,What aſtringent medicamētes the Patient muſt vſe. vvhich before repaſt, or comeſtion are vſed: for he cō
               tayninge the viandes, or cibaryes, they helpe alſo to the digeſtiō of the ſame: but by the aſtringent thinges I vnderſtande, &amp; meane, vvhich are reaſonablelye fortifyinge, and confortative, and thoſe vvhich are helpefulle to the concoctione: For it vveare the greateſt, &amp; abſurdeſt error of the vvorlde, if ſoe be in the firſt, &amp; eſpeciallye in an vnhealthfulle bodye, to vſe violent ſtopping &amp; aſtringent medicamētes, for it vveare nothinge els, thē to ſhutt &amp; keepe our enimye or theefe vvithin doores.
            VVherfore his viandes, or meate &amp; drincke,What his meates, &amp; drinckes muſt be. muſt onlye be Diureticke, &amp; aſtringent &amp; cauſinge to voyde vrine, becauſe through the vrine eſpecially, all aquoſitye of the blood is evacuated: but if ſo be you perceave, that the great toughenes of the acute &amp; ſharp aduſted Pituita, or aquoſity, vvhich is verye retardatelye expelled &amp; conglutinateth vvith the guttes, or entralles, is a cauſe of the bloody flixe, vvith payn &amp; vvith corroſiō, you muſt thē vvith diſcretiō vſe the urine expulſors, or vrine provokīg remedyes becauſe through the vſe therof, it expelleth the aaquoſity throgh the vvhich othervvyſe the forſayed viſcouſe &amp; tough Pituita, might by chaū

permit ſome conſideringe the imbicillitye of their ſtomackes, to vſe &amp; drincke a little aſtringent vvyne.
            
               Medicamentes vvhich vve muſt eſchevve.Farthermore vve muſt bevvare, and take heede, of all ſharpe, &amp; mordicant medicamentes, as Arſenicum, Auripigmentum, Antimonium Sal Gemmae, &amp; manie other ſuch like thinges, &amp; that becauſe of their, to great, &amp; ſuddayne evacuationes, &amp; becauſe they irritate &amp; provoacke the diſſeaſe.
            Thirdlye vve muſt conſider on the Liver, &amp; eſpeciallye on the ſtomacke, becauſe all thoſe vvhich are afflicted vvith the bloodye flixe, can digeſt noe viandes. The ſpecialle end muſt be the fluxione, or the diſſeaſe it ſelfe.
            The Scopus of the fluxione is, to ſtoppe, &amp; to diverte the concurrent humors, but vve muſt in the firſt gentlely, &amp; eaſilye reſerate the ſame, &amp; vvith ſuch, conſideration, as before vve have ſayed, leaſt that in reſeratinge of the ſame you increaſe the ague, the vvhich vvith reaſon, and experience may chaunce.
            
               Remedyes vvhich may be taken out of the reaſon.The remedyes vvhich may be taken out of the reaſon, are ether externall, or internalle.
            The internall are, ether ſimple, or cōpovvnde. Simple, as Covvemilcke, nue Egges, vvith Maſticke, or vvith Ambergreece, Poulder of ſovver Mulberryes, flovvers of Peatches, fine Bolus, Terra ſigillata, confited Nuttes, Nuttmegges, beinge thervvith intermixed: Rhabarbarum ſo acked in Plātine-vvater is alſoe hadde in greate eſtimatione, or in the decoctione of Mirobalanes, Syrope of dryed Roſes, &amp; Iulep, of Roſes.

            An Apologye, for the Chirurgians, wher throughe is apparantlye, &amp; evidentlye demonſtrated, &amp; ſhewed, which be the occaſions, or cauſes of death, in divers &amp; ſundry, wounded Perſons, although notwithſtandinge, their woundes weare ſmalle: wher by the Chyrurgians may be liberated, &amp; excuſed, from all calumnes, &amp; ſclaunders wher with falſely they are accuſed, &amp; reproched.
            THe common diſcourſes of Chyrurgery, are novve adayes farre more meane, &amp; idle, more fabulouſe, &amp; vncertayne, thē the Nativityes of the Goddes, the Hiſtoryes of

the Giantes or the doctrines of the Philoſophicall ſtone yea &amp; a thouſand other phantaſticall ſommationes,Ther is but one experte Chyrurgiancinal Fraunce- &amp; dreames.
            There is novvadayes in all Fraunce, but one expert Chyrurgiane, vvhome everye potentate and great Lorde, endevoureth to retayn by them, vvherthrough they are vvont to ſay I have the beſt &amp; experteſt Chyrurgian vvhich is living, vvherfore they alſo laude, &amp; extoll him, to have a million of knackes vvhich vveare never before herde, or knovvne. The one boaſteth that his Chyrurgiā, in a verye ſhorte time, hath cured one vvhich hath binn ſhott clean throughe his head althoughe the very ſubſtāce of the Braynes,Divers fictions, &amp; Lyes. iſſued therout: the other ſtedfaſtlye affirmeth, that his Chyrurgiane, hath agayn impoſed the Eye of a man, vvhich frō the earth he tooke vp, vvithout beinge deprived of his ſight in that Eye, or els that he cut of a peece of ones Liver, or Milte, &amp; yet hath praeſerved the life of the man. Farthermore an other vvill bouldlye periure himſelfe, &amp; ſay, that they are but nugationes, &amp; Childrens play for his Chyrurgian to cure, a harquebouſhed, or ſhotten vvounde of the Harte, the Liver, the Milte, the Blather, and the ſtomacke, and the Inteſtins and of the great vaynes, yea &amp; is noe more moleſted thervvith, thē vveare the Sould lours of Iulius Caeſar, vvhich never interrogated hovv forcible, &amp; ſtrong theire enimies vveare, but vvheare they vveare: nether one vvhat place of the Citye the breach vvas bartered but vvhether īdeed it vve are ſhott or not.Comparaſion. So that novvadayes, the Chyrurgianes alſo doe not anye more aſke, nether doe any more endevoure, to knovv the nature, the conditiō, the neceſſity, the vſe, or the vvorthines, or excellencye of the vvounded partes, but aſke only vvhether the man be vvouded, &amp; althoughe all the oſſicles of his Legge, vveare cruſhed, yet vvithī the ſpace of 14. dayes, at the fartheſt, vvith theire vvater of ſhottē vvoundes they are able to cure them, although I my ſelfe doe not diſdayne the ſame, the ſame beinge adminiſtred, &amp; vſed vvith diſcretton. And breefly to cōclude each lord ſuppoſeth that he hath by him an Hippocrates, an Aeſculapius, a Podalirus, a Machaon.
            
            Out of vvhich ignorāce, &amp; perſuaſion, as not to knovve, vvhat vvoundes are mortalle or curable, vvhat vvoūdes are little, or greate, vvhich are of an eaſy, or difficulte reſanation, ther muſt then neceſſarilye heerout follovve, that vvhēas any body ſeemeth to be little hurt &amp; dyeth vnder the hādes of a moſt expert Chyrurgiā ether becauſe of the greatnes of the vvound, through any vnhealthfullnes of the bodye, through any concurſione of humours, or els becauſe of any vnexpected accidentes, he is then vvithout all compaſſione, blamed, diſdayned and diffamed, notvvithſtandinge all his greate paynes or dilligence, accordinge to the arte he in curinge of the foreſayed Patient hath done &amp; that, becauſe they are ignorant of the cauſes of his deathe, &amp; allvvayes perſuade themſelves,A fooliſh perſuaſiō
                that if the Patiēt had binne in handes of theire Chyrurgiane, he vvithout al doubte had not dyed, although that theire Chyrurgian, have experimented &amp; tried little or nothinge at all and is vvholy inexperte ſo that by continuance of time vve finde thē to doe, or vvorck noe more miracles thē a common or lay man, and alſo vvith noe more certayntye, doctrine, nor experience and oftentimes in their practiſe, beinge at theire vvittes, or councels end, are conſtrayned to ſue for ſuccoure, &amp; ayde of their companions, or partakers. Becauſe therfore that in conſeqvente times heerafter, theſe fellovves, ſhould not vndeſervedlye reape ſuch honoure, &amp; the aunciente Chyrurgianes might liberate, &amp; free thēſelves from all calumnes, &amp; of beinge ignorāt vvhich is layed to their charge, and to reqvite, and reſolve the opinions of thoſe mighty, and potē
               tat Lordes vvith reaſon, becauſe therafter they doe no more blame, and ſclaunder the Chyrurgianes, I vvill heere breeflye recite,Some vvoundes are eſteemed to be ſmall, vvhich indeede are great and daungerous. the occaſions of Death, cauſinge them playnlye, and evidently, to vnderſtāde that ther are ſome vvhich of a vvoūd, vvhich vve eſteeme to be but ſmall, and of little regarde, doe notvvithſtanding dye, &amp; yet of expert, &amp; learnede men the ſame vvas eſteemed, and accounted for a perillouſe vvounde. And contrarilye, ſome are cured of great vvoundes, vvhich indeede vve eſteeme to be but ſmalle, and of little regarde, and vvhich vvith all facilitye may be cured.They can not cure all men. Notvvithſtandinge beinge impoſſible for the Chyrurgiane, hovv erudite, &amp; experte, ſoever he be, to cure all men, althoughe at ſometimes they be vvoundede vvith verye ſmalle vvoundes.
            Novv therfore to returne to our diſcourſe,What is required to the reſanatione of vvoundes. vve muſt firſt of all knovve, that to cure a vvoundede parte, &amp; to reſtore agayne that perſon- into his former, &amp; accuſtomed eſtate of health thervnto are many thinges reqvired, vvhich I heere normallye, &amp; rightlye vvill proſecute. Firſt of all ther is the integrity, force, &amp; vigore of the vulneratede, &amp; hurte parte, or membre: As evidentlye doe demonſtrat vnto vs, the aucthoritye, reaſone, and experience: For accordīg to the opinione, and ſentence, of divine Hippocrates, It is nature vvhich cureth all ſickneſſes, and diſſeaſes ſect. 5. Epid. 6.
            The vvounded partes are infeebled, ether cō
               ſidering the nature of their firſt conformation or throughe any accidentes, chauncinge to the diſſeaſe, or els becauſe of any hurtes, or ſhottes vvhich happen vnto the ſame: vve may throughe their nature knovve thē vvhen as the head is to little, for as then it is vvhole inconveniēt: Or els to groſſe and ſo vaſte, and ponderouſe,

that becaus of the diſſeaſe, the patiēt is not able to beare vp the ſame right on his ſhoulders: If ſo be it be perfectlye, and completly rounde for in ſuch a Heade is ether vvanting, the anterioure,A Heade noughtily formed or the poſterioure future, or both of thē together vvhich are the ſuſpiracles, through the vvhich nature diſburſeth her ſelfe, of all ſuperfluityes, vvhich beinge therin contaynede, they retardate the curatione of the vvounde. And if it ſoe chaunced, that the Heade of your vvounded, vveare indecently formed, the vvound ſeeminge to be ſmall, (allthough indeede noe Capitalle vvoundes are to be eſteemed ſmalle) and the curation therof be tardife, and the Patiente chaunce to dye therof, vve ought not as then in anye ſorte to attribute the faulte vnto the Chyrurgiane but to the badde formatione of that parte vvhich is hurte, or vvounded.
            VVe muſt alſoe vnderſtande the ſame of the Breaſte, vvhich being anguſte, &amp; ſtricte, ſufficiently demonſtrateth vnto vs, that the harte and the naturall calor of the ſame are very feeble be cauſe the domicille of the harte, &amp; the Lūges is to anguſtlye formed: vvhich might be the cauſe that if any body, being vvounded in ſuch an anguſt &amp; ſtricte breaſte, ſhall vvith great difficulty receave agayn his health, becauſe the natural caliditye, being in theſe partes feeble, &amp; lāguide ſhall not be able to ſurmount the Accidentes vvhich ordinarilye happen vnto ſuch partes, as difficulty of reſpiratiō, through the oppreſſion of the effuded blood in that part, vvhich cā not be digeſted, nor expelled, ether by the Mouthe, or through the vvoūd, &amp; that for vvante of naturall caloure, vvhich cōmonly in ſuch a ſtricte &amp; anguſte Breaſt is very ſmalle.Abadde formed Backe, or Backebone. The like may alſo be ſayed of the Back, &amp; of the Spina Dorſi or Backebone, vvhich being ſōvvhat to lōg as thoſe vvhich cōtumeliouſlye, &amp; diridingly vve call Elevenribbes, becauſe they have ſuch huge and vaſte long ſydes vvherof vve neede not doubt, but that ſuch a Back or Backcbone, is farre more debile then others, &amp; therfore more apte, and prone to receave anye vnnaturall humiditye, vvherfor alſo in ſuch vvoūdes there happē great fluxiōs betvveen the Muſcles, &amp; the ſkinn &amp; betvvixte the diſtāces of the ſame, becaus of the great quātity of excremētes, vvhich have theire accourſe out of the Braynes, &amp; other partes of the body, vvherby, betvveē the Muſcles &amp; the diſtāces of the ſame, there ſincke manye ſuperfluous humors, vvhich by conſequēce of time are chaūged into ſome venoumouſe humiditye, &amp; matter, through the vvhich vve are ſōtimes cō
               ſtrayned, to make ſome great apertione, vvhich require a long continuance of time to the mū

               times alſo aulter &amp; chaūg into fiſtles, becaus of the tendernes &amp; ſoftenes of the part, vvhich cā not be ſhut, nether through ligamentes reſerated, or cōpreſſede, as an arme or legg. Hippocrates hath obſerved, &amp; noted that betvvixte feeble,A notable ſentence. &amp; diſeaſed fleſhe ther alvvayes deſcēdeth &amp; ſīcketh a vvateriſhe humudity, vvhich eaſily can corrupt. The ſmall, thinne,Hippes vvhich are baddly formede &amp; Hern faſhoned hippes &amp; legges, vvherof vve commonlye ſay they goe one VVayghtes, &amp; are vnder, and above all moſt of aequall craſſititude and thicknes, cōtrary to thoſe vvhich vve ſaye, to be hipped, &amp; legged, or have a payere of goode, &amp; ſtedfaſt ſtiltes vnder thē, vvhich are vvel proportioned, vvher of daylye experience teacheth vs, &amp; that to our greate greefe, and ſorrovve, that ſuch perſons, ether being vvoūded in hippes, in the legges or in the feete, are ſubiecte vnto many, and divers accidentes, &amp; the vvoundes alſoe difficult to be cured &amp; mūdifyed,Legges vvhich are of a difficulte reſanatiō. in the vvhich oftētimes above the ordinary fluxiōs therin engēdreth proude fleſhe: &amp; novve being as it vveare almoſt readye to be Cicatrizede, can very difficultely be brought thervnto, &amp; being cicatrized, through anye ſmall occaſion burſteth open agayn. And if ſo be the bones be offended, or brokē, as then the Ioyncte moſt commonlye conſumeth, and vvithereth &amp; the health very retardately can be agayne reſtored.
            Novv all this vvhich hath binn ſayed,The moſt trueſt, &amp; aſſuredſt ſigne of the imbicilitye of any part is ſufficientlye knovvne, vvith all the diſeaſes of all other partes. But vve muſt generallye note, that the moſt aſſuredſt ſigne, of the imbicilitye of anye parte, chaunceth through, the vntemperatnes, and badde formatiō of the ſame: for if ſo be that the Temperamente, had binne goode, and by conſequence, the formative virtue had binn ſtronge, ſhe ſhould as then exactlye have formed that parte: for by the operation is the operator therof knovvne. VVherfofe Ariſtotle is of opinion, that the incomplete creation, hath her deformity, through the vvante of the frigide, &amp; could nature, and the imbicillity of the Sperma:Similitude. for even as vve ſee, that the Mechanicall operatours, or handyecraftes men, can not make any peece of vvorke ſo perfect, &amp; ſo neate, of a badd peece of ſtuffe as, they might vvell &amp; eaſily doe, of a good, and apt and tractable peece of ſtuffe, vvhich is not ſpoyled, nor corrupted.
            All vvhich is before approvede by the thirde rule, ſect. 1. of the ſixte Epidemiorū Hippocratis, &amp; founded, on an excellēt Axioma in the commē
               taries of Galē, vvhere be ſayeth, Imbicilla membra multum pravumque excrementum colligere conſueverunt.
            
            Such a congregatiō, &amp; excreſcence of venoū
               ous excrementes vvhich chaunce to congregate themſelves together in ſuch deformed partes doe drounde, choacke,Suffocatiō of the naturall calidity. &amp; oftentimes corrupte the naturalle caloure, firſt of all of the diſeaſed parte, and then of the vvhole bodye, after the vvhich muſt neceſſarilye follovve death, vvithout the Chyrurgiane being able to remedy the

ſame or vvith any aequitye might therof be blamed although notvvithſtanding oftētimes the Princes &amp; great Lordes, vvhich of theſe matters have ſmalle knovvledge, vvithout occaſiō doe blame, &amp; reproache theire Chyrurgians: yea &amp; ſome times alſo accuſe them, &amp; require of the magiſtrate to have puniſhed, &amp; themſelves alſo vndeſervedlye puniſhe theire Chyrurgians.Accidental imbicillity.
            
            Touching the accidētalle imbicillity, vvhich hath binne from the beginning of the firſt creation, it is certayn, that as vve have ſayed of the momorſions, or Bittes, even ſo in like ſorte vve may ſaye of the diſeaſes, that the firſt are verye nocent, vnto the laſt: For Quae non poſſunt ſingula, multa nocent: &amp; a little therafter, Gutta cavat lapidem, non vi, ſed ſaepe cadendo. VVe doe not throughe ſicknes a mende, &amp; the pitcher goeth ſo often to the vvell, till that in the end he returne broken home agayne. For all diſeaſes are of ſo venoumous a nature that although they are cleane cured, yet they relinquiſhe ſome badde reliques in the parte, vvherthrough they may the eaſyer returne agayne, vvherfore of our Divine Hippocrates it is called Philoſtrophes,
               The one diſeaſe follovvinge the other is very troubleſome. vvhich ſignifyeth, noe return agayn or at the leaſt, ſuch partes are as then moſt ſubiected to receave ſome nue diſeaſe: alſo the ſayed Hippocrates ſayeth farther, in his Booke of internall diſeaſes, that all aegritudes, vvhich follovv any other diſeaſe, are allvvayes moſt cōmonlye mortall: becauſe ſhee findeth the naturall forces debilitated: vvhich vve allſoe muſt vnderſtande of the vvoundes, vvhich are receaved in anye partes of the body, vvhich before have once binn vvounded.An ague being cured commonlye leaveth an Empirema after her. Theſe diſpoſitiones are of oure Phyſiciones called Diatheſes and are eſteemed to have great forces, for the generatione of diſeaſes or for an incurable confirmation of the ſame: In like ſorte allſo relinqueſheth an Empirema after her, vvher by that Perſonne is made more ſubicte to receave more agues, &amp; that in ſuch a ſorte as a hott ovē, vvhich hath once binne heated, is more apte agayn to receave the heat: as in exāple, ther be any on vvhich hath once binn vvounded, agayn being vvounded, &amp; eſpeciallye in the ſame place, vvher before he vvas vvoūded it is impoſſible that the ſayed parte ſhoulde have, the ſame force, virtue, or vigour, to repugme and to reſiſte for the curatiō vvhich before ſhee hath hadde, before ever ſhee vvas vvounded: and that in ſuch ſorte as in a Corſelet or harnas, vvherone hath binne a ſhott, and having gotten a cruſhe, or bendinge in, allthoughe the ſame be beaten, and malleated ſmothe agayne, yet it vvill never be beatē ſo ſmoothe, nether ſo playne &amp; ſtrong as it vvas before it hadde the ſhott. Nether can can I heer praetermit, to recite thoſe vvhich have itenerated, and travelled throughe the Sudatorye regione, and paſſede, throughe the driveling, or ſputaminouſe climate, &amp; beinge agayn ready to travell the ſame vvay, being grevouſlye vvounded, vvher there is one vvhich is ſafelye returned from the iournye vvith good fortune, there are three, yea &amp; foure vvhich by the vvay doe faynte and ſo dye: vvherfor as thē vve admire, vvhy they are not cured, or vvhye their reſanation is ſo tardife, not conſidering that the vvounded vvas halfe before corrupted,The vvoū
                  ded vvhich have binn in the drivelinge climate can verye difficultly be cured. &amp; that his humors have vvholy binne aultered throughe the venoumouſnes of the foreſayed diſeaſe: or havinge binne cured therof, have as yet retayned any aulteratione in the Liver, or in anye other internalle partes, vvhich gathereth continuallye many venoumous excrementes, vvhich the foreſayed parte vvithout anye ceſſation, diſchargeth into the vvounded parte.
            And ſoe moſt commonlye the occaſione of death commeth throughe the inordinate ſtate of life, in eatinge,Gluttony is the occaſion of much evel. and drinckinge vvithout obſervinge anye rule of victitation, hauntinge alſo of vvoemen, and not ſuffering themſelves to be handled, of the handes of the Chyrurgian, as the cauſe requireth, it be ether in tenting of the vvounde, by inſciſione, by cauteriſatian, &amp; by keepinge himſelfe quiet vvhich all aunciente Chyrurgians ſo highly and exactlye commaū
               de,Eaſe is goode for al vvoundes. to the furtherāce of the curatiō of the vvoū
               de, follovvinge the ſayinges of Celſus, that Optimum Medicamentum, quies, &amp; abſtinentia, is: Soe that I am intended, as of a thinge that is of all men knovvne, not much in this place to ſpeake therof althoughe notvvithſtanding, it is oftentimes the occaſione of death, hovv lightly ſoever they be vvounded: yea allſoe and of greate vvoundes, being cleane out of daunger throughe theire inordinate manner of lyfe, eſpeciallye in eatinge, and drinckinge, doe agayne fall therin, and come to a farre more vvorſe eſtate then ever before they vveare, yea and ſometimes allſoe dye therof: for it is moſt certayne that.
            
               More ther are which of Gluttonye dye heere,
               Then of blowes, or ſhottes to death come neere.
            
            So that vve vvill novve, handle, or treacte,Conſideration on the time of the yeare. of the times of the yeare. There is nothīg more manifeſt, then that many vvounded perſonnes might of theire vvoundes be cured, if ſoe be the time of the year, vveare ſuch, as it vveare requiſite it ſhould, that is, if ſoe be the foure ſeaſons of the yeare, reſerved their naturall temperature &amp; quallity: It is alſo apparent that the intemperature of the ayr, the diſordre of the time, the aſtrolicalle venoume, &amp; other funeſtall influences, doe make the vvoundes incurable, or els verye difficulte to be cured, and chaungeth the habitude, and complexione of men, throughe the chaunginge of the time, &amp; through the Aſtronomicall conſtellation, vvhich over vs is

praedominating. As if ſo be the vvinter, vvhich ought indeede to be coulde,The irregulatede ſeaſon of the yeare aultereth our bodyes. vveare vvarme, &amp; the ſummer vvhich ought to be vvarm, is coulde: Alſo vvhen it is novv hott, thē could, novv drye, thē moyſte, vvithout the time of the yeare requiringe the ſame to be othervvyſe then he ought to be: vvhoe cā doubte therof but the ſame muſt be preiudiciall, to the vvoūded patiēt? becauſe our bodyes, heere bye receave mervaylouſe, &amp; ſuddayne alterations &amp; chaunginges, vvherthrough out vitall ſpirites, &amp; humors, are vvondrouſlye, &amp; vvith great daunger aultered, obſervinge the ſayinge of Hippocrates, vvhich avoucheth that all repentine &amp; ſubite permutatiō, hovv ſoever the ſame may be are vnto our bodyes very preiudicialle.All repentine, &amp; ſuddayne chaunge is daungerouſe. The divrnalle experience demōſtrateth the ſame vnto vs, for if ſo be in the vvinter, in ſtede of a drye coulde vvinde, there reſpire a ſouthvveſt vvind, vvith vvarmiſhe ſhovvres of rayne, ther then cōmonlye follovve greate corruptiones in our humors, vvherthroughe the vvoundes doe putrifye, and gangraenize. The infected ayre, may alſo be an occaſion, of the death of manye vvounded perſons, hovv little ſoever they ſōtimes are vvounded: becauſe vvithout ayre vve can not Live, vvhich allvvayes ſuch as it is vve muſt receave,We can not live vvithout ayre. &amp; that not ōly through the mouth, &amp; through all the conductes of our bodye, &amp; poro

               Galen in the ninth of his Methodes, attributeth ſo much to the ayr, that he ſayeth that the eſpecialliſt, &amp; principaliſt demonſtratiō to cure anye diſſeaſe, muſt be obſerved out of the ayre: becauſe vve cā in noe ſorte, be vvanting or miſſinge the communitye, and vſe therof.

               Hippocrates ſpeakinge of thoſe vvhich have to little bloode, in the 24. rule of the fourthe ſection, in the ſixt Epid: ſayeth that thoſe vvhich have theire entralls hott, &amp; as it vveare burninge, theire fleſhe could &amp; have binn badlye nouriſhed,Which are vnhealth ſame poeple. vvhich commonly vve call vnhealthſame poeple, vvho having receaved in theire bodyes ſome great vvoūd, are moſt cōmonly alvvayes very difficulte to be cured, for vvant of materialles: vvhich alſo vve may ſee to be in aged perſons, vvhē as they are any vvhear vvounded, or by chaunce breake their legges. VVe have alſo an excellent rule in Hippocrate vvhich is, the 6. Aphoriſme, of the ſixte ſectione vvhere he ſayeth Hydropicorum,
               A notatable ſentence. 
               &amp; lentiginorum on other places he addethe therūto Vlcera non facile ſanantur: of thoſe vvhich are troubled vvith the Dropſy, becauſe theire bloode is to cleere, &amp; vvateriſhe: of the lentiginouſe, becauſe theire bloode is to ſharpe, or tarte, &amp; for that occaſione can make noe goode combinatione, or healinge: &amp; vvhereby this might be occaſion, to vvit, vvhether it be through nature, or by the inordinate māner of life, of eating, or drincking, it becauſed, as by the drincking of ſtronge vvynes, or by eatinge of garlick, of Onions, of Porrhy, of pouldred, or ſaulted meate, or of ſpices, as the ſuldiours vveare vvonte to doe, that is little belōging to our purpoſe. Nether can I heer praetermit to ſpeke,Perturbation of minde. of the perturbāce of the minde vvherthroughe moſt commonlye the Martialiſtes are very much afflicted, vvhich through the generoſity of their courage, if ſo be that in any aſſault, battayle or ſkirmiſhe, they have not valiāte enoughe born thēſelves, or at the leaſt not to the cō
               tentatiō of their Capitayne, &amp; have not as Caeſariſtes behaved thēſelves, &amp; fought &amp; are therfore blamed, of thoſe vvhich are their, enviours &amp; ſuch as hate thē, vvherī they doe ſo vehemē
               tlye vexe, &amp; greeve themſelves, that it ircketh thē, &amp; doe ſo melancholize themſelves therin, that they doe vvholy neglect thēſelves, deſiring &amp; vociferatinge for death rather thē to live ſoe miſerablelye in diſhonoure. VVherfore alſo it may happen in the ſame, (beinge greevouſlye vvoūded) that vvhich happened to the Lord of Auſſun, vvhich vvas one of the moſt valiant, &amp; moſt magnanimouſe, gentlemen of all Fraūce, of vvhome it vvas cōmonly for a proverbe ſayed,Hardines of Aſſun. the hardines, and valoure d'Auſſun, cauſeth vs to adhibite credite thervnto, vvho, throughe I knovve not vvhat miſchaunce, &amp; ſuddayn aſtoniſhmēt in the firſt charge of the battayle at dreux, ther arrived &amp; as it vvear overvvhelmed him ſuch a diſgrace, for the vvhich he ſo greeved him ſelfe, and ſorrovved that vvithin fevv dayes therafter vvith ſorrovve he died: havinge ſolemlye ſvvorne, that he vvould never anye more eate, or drincke, vvith vvhich reſolution hedyed. Contrarily the ſouldiors ſōtimes, doe ſo valiauntly cōbate, by the vvhich they vvexe ſo couragious, &amp; doe ſo ioy thēſelves therin, &amp; therby doe ſo exalt thēſelves, that their harte of tētimes is inflamed, &amp; puffed vp vvith pride of their victory, &amp; honoure vvhich they reape, &amp; enioy. VVhich cauſeth great alteratiō, &amp; chaū
               ge as vvel in the body of the one as of the other.
            And to ſpeake truth,The perturba

                  ate effect &amp; forces in our bodyes. ſuch motiōs &amp; turbatiō of the minde, are of great forces, in the body of man, they cauſe therin ether great aegritudes &amp; diſſeaſes, or els death: for if to be the motions, and perturbations of the minde, have pover to increace the naturall caloure, or to diminiſ he the ſame, of cauſing the ſame to dravve in vvardes, or to expell the ſame outvvardes &amp; to ſpreade it ſelfe by the vvhole bodye: &amp; ſuch motiōs of the naturall calour, vvhich doe reduce vvith thē the vitall ſpirites, &amp; the blood, is an occaſiō of all diſſeaſes, &amp; of health: ther muſt then certaynlye ſubſeqvute, that the ſayed motions, and perturbationes of the ſoule, and minde, have all povver in their handes of our healthe.
            So that it is even as Ariſtotle, Lib. de motu animalis

Chap. 5. ſayeth, that the motions, and turbations of the minde, doe cauſe ſuch a remotiō and alteration of the naturall caloure: as Hippocrates alſo teſtifieth the ſame vnto vs ſect. 5. of the 6. Epidemiorum, &amp; Galenus Cap. 5. ſecundae de Symptomatum cauſis and Chap. 5. of the ſeconde of Methodes;Through pertubations of the minde, a man may dye. vvhere he demōſtrateth, that ther are manye vvhich throughe motione, and perturbatione of the mindes have died: VVherfore Galen alſo, on the 14. rule, of the 4. ſection, of the ſixt Epidemiorum, thoſe vvhich internallye, have a ſharpe corrodent caloure, (vvherfore by by ſoe much the more vve muſt prohibite the vvounded) to abſtayn from ire, and choler, and from all turbations of the minde, vvherbye the humors might be moved. The ſayed Galen in his booke de ſanitate tuenda demonſtrateth, that all turbations of the ſoule &amp; all motions of the minde, do ingendre greate quantitye of Cholera vvherby are cauſed great inflāmatiōs &amp; fluxions in the vvounded parte and per conſeqvence a Gangraena, and ſomtimes in the end a ſuddayne death.
            Amongſt all other turbations of the ſpirites, Ioy is that vvhich ought to cauſe the leaſt accidentes vnto our bodyes, notvvithſtanding vvas the ſame ſo immoderate, and violent in Chilonio lacedemonico,
               Suddayne death of Ioy. &amp; in Diagero Rhodiano, both the vvhich ſoe ioyed themſelves, perceavinge their children victoriouſlye to returne over theire enimies, that of ioy they both immediatlye, and ſuddaynlye died: for through ſuch immoderate ioy, the bloode and the vitall ſpirites of the Harte, are vvith ſuch vehemēcy reverted from the Harte, and diffuſed and diſperced, throughe the vniverſall bodye that the Harte, is vvholye deſtitute of his naturall caloure, &amp; the perſone muſt neceſſarilye fall into ſyncopizatione, or fayntnes, out of vvhich commonly follovveth death:Virtues of moderate ioy. But if the ioy be moderate, it fortifyeth, and ſtrengtheneth the animale, &amp; the naturalle virtues, ſtirreth vp the vitall ſpirites, &amp; ſuggerateth the digeſtione, and is conſequently commodious for all the conſtitutione of mans bodye, vvherthrough the Ioynctes, are throughely ſoacked, &amp; moyſtened, becauſe of the humiditye vvhich is diſperced throughe the vvhole maſſa of the bloode, ſoe that by this meanes, the vvoundes are better mundified, and incarnated and thoſe partes doe increace, and pingvifye.
            
               Effects of Cholera.In like ſort alſoe doth Cholera, or anger, and yet alſo more, then the immoderate ioy: becauſe heerby, beſydes all this that in the ſpirites &amp; humors of the bodye is cauſed greate corrvptione and they throughe theire greate heat, &amp; caloure chaunce to inflame, and by this meanes conſequently, the vvhole habitvde of the body is replete vvith putride agues, hovv little ſicke ſoever the perſone be, vvhich foreſayed agues, if they chaunce to afflict the patient vnto death as it oftentimes happeneth, vve moſt commō
               lye then attribute the ſame vnto his vvound,Accidentes of ſorrovve. as if of the Chyrurgiane he had not binne vvell handled, and not to the ague. Is it not evidente enoughe vnto vs, vvhat accidentes are cauſed throughe ſorrovv, and greefe, hovv healthfull, &amp; ſovnd ſoever the perſonne be vvhich is thervvith intrapped? for ſhe ſoe reſerateth, and as it vveare ſtrictly occludeth the Harte, that by noe meanes there can engendre anye vitall ſpirites, and hovv fevv ſoever ther are, yet they may not be diſpercede vvith the bloode throughe the vvhole body, becauſe the ſame is groſſe, and tenebrous, by the vvhich the vitall virtues, and al theire accōplices, are debilitated: ſo that in the end a man is in his minde vexed, &amp; hebede,The melācholicke doe hate thē
                  ſelves. the Harte omitteth all ioy, &amp; pleaſure, he odiouſly hateth himſelfe, fallinge into deſperatione, and raginge, havinge loſt his livelye coloure in his face, conſuming the body, vvherby oftentimes muſt follovv death.
            It vvill not alſo be alienate vnto our purpoſe, to the a poroving of my ſayinges, that I heere recite that vvhich the father of eloquence hath vvrittē 
               ad Atticum, the vvordes vvherof are theſe: It vveare an excellent matter my good frend Atticus, that man could live, vvithout meate, or drincke: but yet a farre more excellellēter matter if ſo be vvithout anye envie, and hate vve coulde Live: becauſe thoſe viandes vvhich vve eate, doe corrupt nothīg els thē our humours, but the trayterous envie, and ſorrovv, doe conſume vs evē vnto the bones: Envye, &amp; malice conſume the bones, &amp; corrode the entralls, as vve playnlye may behoulde: for man ſickeneth, through ſome certayne envye, &amp; malice, of the vvhich he by continuance of time dieth. Doeſt thou not knovv by experience, that tvvo torturors, vvhich vvill deprive a mā of life, that the torturer of greefe, and ſorrovve is the moſt cruelleſt, yea then of the Gluttonye?Effectes of ſtupefactione.
            
            Nether may vve heere omitt to recenſe, and ſpeake of the obſtupeſcēce, &amp; feare, vvhervvith the covvardes, &amp; faynte harted are oftentimes touched, and taken: This ſtupor cauſeth in vs, the ſame accidētes vvhich the ſorrovve cauſeth but ſomvvhat greater for the time: for this fore ſayed ſtupefactione, and feare, expulſeth from him, &amp; retracteth tovvarde the harte (but vvith more feſtination, &amp; more raptnes, then the ſorrovv) the bloode &amp; the vitall ſpirites, vvherfor vve may perceave, that the face in the time of ſtupefactione, &amp; feare, vvaxeth pale, and the externall partes coulde, vvith tremblinge of the vvhole body: the Belly relaxateth, &amp; the ſpeech fayleth, vvith a greate reverberation of the harte, becauſe that throughe the greate quantity of bloode, &amp; of the ſpirites, vvhich ſuddaynly doe retire thethervvardes, being allmoſt ſuffocated can verye difficultlye move it ſelfe, but greatly

deſireth to be refreſhed, and diſcharged of ſuch a ſarcinatione, ſo that oftentimes ther follovveth death, becauſe the bloode being dravvne tovvardes the Harte, ſuffocateth it ſelfe there, &amp; by that meanes the naturall calor and the vitall ſpirites beīg extingviſhed,Error of the vulgare, &amp; cō
                  mon poeple. vvithout the vvhich the life of man can not be preſerved.
            If ſo be that anye bodye beinge vvounded, through perturbatiōs of the mind doe chaūce to dye, the vulgare &amp; commō poeple, vvill not attribute the occaſiō of death vnto choſe praecedent, or praenominated occaſions, but farre more to the negligence, and ignorance, of the Chyrurgian, vvhich hath not intreacted him, as it vveare convenient he had done,Feare and nicenes doe impeach health. although that thoſe vvhich have a more ſovvnder iudgement of ſuch occaſions, vvill iudge clane contrarye thervnto, and others. The like alſo may be ſayed of thoſe, vvhich vvill not allovv of the vvill, and intente of the Chyrurgian, nether of anye other remedyes vvhich vveare commodious, and proffitable for his health, beinge ether to timorous, or delicate, to ſuffer any apertion, vvhich for his diſeaſe had binne neceſſarye, to adminiſtre iſſue, &amp; paſſage to ſome corrodent matter, or parcells of bones, that lye there praepared &amp; readye to be taken out, vvhich by theire remanſione in that place, doe alſo corrupte the finitimate partes, doe alter &amp; permutate the remanent part of bone, and corrupt the Marrovve, vvherby the health, can not ſuddaynlye follovve, as the Chyrurgiane is exoptatinge, &amp; vviſhinge for the ſame, yea alſo &amp; by this meanes oftentimes remayne incurable, by vvhich occaſione the Chyrurgiane,The Hiſtorye of Duke d'Aumalle aftervvardes Duke of Guyſe. vvith his Patient muſt hope for that vvhich his Patient vvill not ſuffer, and yet notvvithſtandinge is required of his diſeaſe. And to this end Du Bellay, reciteth in his memoryes, that the Duke d'Aumall, ſonne to the Duke a Gvyſe, being mortally vvoū
               ded, vvith a ſplīter of a laūce, vvhich pearced his Eye, ſayed to the Chyrurgians, intreate, or handle not my ſonne as a Prince, or mightye Lord, but as a Pioner, or ſervant: vvhich vvas alſoe an occaſione of his reſanation, becauſe he ſuffered,Contemplation of inſtrumentes. that the tronchone of the Launce, vvhich ſtucke clean through his heade, to be vvith force, and violence dravvne therout.
            And if therfore vve deſire to enter into the contēplatiō of the diverſityes of inſtrumemē
               tes vvhervvith the vvoūdes are made, vve ſhall then finde ſufficient occaſion, to eſtabliſhe the vnexſpected death conſidering onlye the matter vvherof the vvoundes are receaved, as vvell of the ſmall, as greate vvoundes. Thoſe vvhich have vvritten of Agriculture,Whervvith the vvounde is made muſt be cōſidered or tillage, &amp; Gardening, as Cato Plinius, &amp; Columella ſay, that theris greate difference, vvhether a tree be vvith an Iron knife engraffed, or vvith a knife of Bone. And vve make little or noe differēce, vvhether our bodyes are vvounded vvith Leade, Iron or Braſſe, ſeing that braſſe being mixed vvithe the matter of our vvoundes reſolveth it ſelfe into viriditye, vvhich corrodeth the fleſhe, and cauſeth ſomtimes ſuch an inflammatiō, that death therafter follovveth. Nether is it ſufficiēt, that in ſhorte time, vve have accommodated this mettle vnto our ruine, but novv by little and little vve make it four cornerde, vvhich is farre more daungerouſe, thē if it vveare rounde, becauſe throughe the quadrangulatenes therof, it reſcindeth, cutteth &amp; breaketh in peeces al that vvherō it glaunceth, vvithout any ſmalle hope of reſanatione: as alſo ſomtimes the bullets are faſtened together vvith coppervvyer by vvhich meanes they cutt a ſundre all fleſhe, vaynes, arteryes and Synnues, vvhich are in that parte.

To this obiect I anſvvere, that all vvoundes vvhich ſeeme to be larg &amp; ample, are not therfor mortall or perillous, as are the great carnall or fleſhye diſſolutions or vvoundes, vvherin none of the vvorthieſt partes are touched vvhich are neceſſarye to the life of man, vvherin are nether hurte great Vaynes, Arteryes or ſynnues, but vvhich are onlye greate, &amp; cutt in the fleſhe, as in the Buttocke, in the calfe of the Legges or in an Arme and yet notvvithſtandinge be called a great vvounde, not being ſo daungerous, as the leaſt punctiō of a ſynnue is, or the hurt of a greate Vayne or Arterye, or els a little fiſſure of the Cranium, or any ſmall thruſt in the Breſt, or the inferior parte of the Bellye, percinge into the concavitye of the ſame.Daungerouſe vvoundes And if ſo be there vveare any vvhich of ſuch vvoundes vveare cured, beinge great vvoundes, not conſideringe the apertione, but becauſe of the vvoūded parte they ought to be vvell diſpoſed, to buſte &amp; ſtrong, to reſiſte ſuch an evell, &amp; impeach the accidentes vvhich happen thervnto, that they muſt alſo be rightlye diſpoſed&amp; tempered vvithout anye of the vvorthye partes, or thoſe vvhich are neceſſary vnto life being thervvithe polluted or corrupted, and ſuch may eaſilye be cured:Neceſſary thinges a good curatione. Soe that thoſe vvhich are not vvholye ſovvnde of body havinge receaved ſuch a vvounde, are in great daunger of death, as others conſidering the difference of the time and of the difference of the bodye, and body, and of partes therof: there are ſome, vvhich are of ſo good a temperature, that they vvith great facility are cured of ſuch vvoū
               des, the vvhich in others bodyes vvear mortal: Contrarily ther are ſome perſons, vvhich have receaved a vvound in ſome abiecte and not neceſſarye parte or Ioyncte, vvithout profoundly penetrating the ſame, vvherof notvvithſtāding they died, ether through the conſtitutiō of the time or throughe the diſpoſition of the bodye, the humours vvher of have their defluēces tovvards the vvounded parte or els through any other occaſions, heere before alleged: but the vulgare poeple, can not compraehend all theſe circumſtances, and conſidirations, as the Chyrurgians doe in ſuch perſons.
            For to ſpeake truth vve looke on the time,The vulgare, and common poeple, cā not ſoe deeplye iudge &amp; conſider any thing as the Chyrurgiane. one the yeare, &amp; daye, numbre of poeple, all vvhich have binne the one as ſorelye hurte, or vvoundede as the other, yet for all that, thoſe vvhich vve eſteeme moſt daungerouſly vvoū
               dede, &amp; vve iudge to be out of all hope, are ſō
               times firſt of all cured: VVher of vve doe not ſo muche admire, after vve have after death anotomizede the deade corpes: for beſydes ther vvounde vve finde, an other apparente occaſione of death.
            As it is as yet in freſhe memory happened to the Lorde of Bellay Barron of Tovarce,Hiſtorye of my lorde of of Bellay. King at d'Ivetot, vvho having receaved a ſhott

Novv the corps beinge Anotomized, vve perceaved his Lunges to be cleane corrupt, and replete vvith obdurate ſchirrouſe vlcerations, his right Kidney alſo vvholy polluted &amp; much matter in his blather: vvhich vvas the occaſione of his death, &amp; not the vvounde it is a thinge therfore moſt certayne, that if ſo be his entralls had binn ſoū
               de vvithout doubte he might have binne cured of his vvounde, becauſe the ſame nether of it ſelfe, nor of anye other accidentes vvas mortall.
            
               An other Hiſtorye of my Lord of Gyuri.The contrarye heerof chaunced, to the great contentation of all the Nobility, to my Lord of Gyuri vvho having receaved, a terrible ſhot, in his ſiniſtre ſhoulder, the entrāce vvherof vvas right in the ioyncture, the bullet havinge touched a great parte of the apophyſis of the bone of the Arme, pearcinge a longe the Omoplate, &amp; remayning, in the inferiore angle of the foreſayed Omoplate, vvhich bullet vvas happely extracted &amp; dravvne out by Mr. Lavenot, ſvvoren Chyrurgiane to the Kinge, vvhich verye excellently hath dreſſed him the firſt time: notvvithſtandinge, he is of this greate vvound (I ſay greate vvounde conſideringe that parte of the bodye) vvholy cured, vvithout perceaving therin any bad accidents.
            
               Nature cureth all diſeaſes.The vvhich vve muſt attribute, partely to the good Temperature compoſitione, and nature, (vvhich muſt cure all diſeaſes,) vvhen as ſhee is evel intreated of experte, and learnede Phyſicions, and Chyrurgians, and therof ayded, as verye excellentlye hath done amongſt others, the right vvorſhipfull Mr. Portaile, Counceller, &amp; chiefe Chyrurgian to the King, vvhich as novv is chiefe amōgſt vs: &amp; of Mr. Gillis des Rus, his Chyrurgiane, vvhich dreſſed him: and vve are heer farther to note, and obſerve, that ther may be an other vvhich being vvoūded in the ſame place of his body,&amp; ſhalbe treacted of the ſelfe ſame Chyrurgians, and ſhall yet for all that dye.
            And for the confirmatione, of al that vvhich is before rehearced, I vvill conclude this my Apologie, throughe my Lordes heerevnder nominated, beginning vvith my Lorde de Hallot de Montmorency, vvho beinge on Horſbacke by the Citye of Rovan, receaved a ſhott of a canon, of the vvhich his Horſe died, &amp; he beinge proſtrated on the earthe, his Legge being in dives peeces brokē right vnder the Ioyncte of the Knee, notvvithſtandinge all vvhich, vvith his good diſpoſitiō &amp; nature hath cōbated agaynſt all the malice of time, &amp; magnitude of the vvounde, beinge verye ſucceſſivelye cured of the right vvorſhipfull Mr. Martel, Chyrurgiane to the Kinge,A
                     •
                  o the Hiſtory. vvho is verye experte in all the operations of Chyrurgerye. Contrarilye, my Lord the Baron of Salignac, beinge vvounded onlye vvith a ſimple ſhott of a handgunn, vvithout anye fracture of bones, in the end dyed therof, al thoughe notvvithſtandinge he vvas aſſiſted by the right vvorſhipfull Mr. Pouget, alſoe one of the Kinges Chyrurgians and chieffe in Montpelliers havinge ſeene the houre, in the vvhich the Gangraena chaunced to his vvounde, manye fluxions oppreſſed him, by vvhich meanes he verye difficultlye coulde be cured: VVhich vve muſt only attribute ūto his tēperature, vvhich vvas not ſoe good as in deede it vveare to be exoptated it had.
            The moſt happye cure vvhich Mr. des Hayes hath effected,A nother Hiſtory. one alſo of the Kinges Chyrurgians, vvhich is a verye vvyſe man in the arte of Chyrurgerye on my Lorde de Vic, gouvernoure for the Kinge in St. Denis, vvho vvith divers vvoundes vvas vvounded, &amp; eſpeciallye in his heade by the crovvne of the heade, and one the ſagittalle ſuture vvhich vvas reſcided cleane overthvvarte, &amp; is therof very ominouſly cured vvherby is demōſtrated vnto vs, vvhat the goode diſpoſitione of the body can doe, vvhich cō
               bated agaynſt the iniuryes, and malice of time, and many other more, inquietudes, vveare cleane contrarye vnto him: vvherin the foreſayed Mr. des Hayes, hath vſed great conſideration, to his perfecte reſanatione.
            The ſame allſoe happened, in my Lorde the Duke of eſpernō,An other Hiſtory. vvho beinge vvounded vvith a greateſhott, vvhich dilaniated a parte of his inferiour lippe, had deprived him of certayn of his teeth, and a part of his chavvbone, penetratinge, &amp; takinge his iſſue cloſe by the vayne Iugularis, vvas cured of Monſt. le Gendre, &amp; Surlin, Chyrurgians to the foreſayed Duke: out of the vvhich vve may playnly note, that not onlye the iunioritye, or youth and good temperature, are not onlye profitable vnto the reſanatione of vvoundes, but alſoe the goode conſtitutione

of the time: For a little before (vvhich vvas about the beſieging of Chartres) thē died moſt of all the vvoūded,The conſtitutione of the time is cō
                  modious to reſanatione hovv ſound notvvithſtanding ſoever they vveare, &amp; hovv little ſoever they vveare vvounded: vvhich partlye vve muſt attribute to the badde conſtitution of the time, as in deede at that time it vvas a diſordred vveather: becauſe in a ſhorte time therafter, all the vvounded vveare of their vvoundes cured: &amp; amongſt others my Lorde the Earle of Flex,An other Hiſtory. vvhoe in the end of the beſieginge, receaved a ſhort of a Canon in the inferiour parte of his Bellye, vvherof it vvas vvholye plettered even vnto the Peritoneum, the vvound being allmoſt the length of a foote, in longitude, of halfe a foot, in latitude, as Mr. Portayle &amp; Samboyſe can vvitnes, vvhich a longe time adminiſtred helpe vnto them.An other Hiſtory. On the ſame time, my Lorde of Favolle vvas cured, of a ſhott, vvhich brake bothe the focilles of his Legg, a little above the anckle, vvhich allſoe vvas cured of the right vvorſhipfulle Mr. Portaile, &amp; d'Amboyſe, &amp; of the moſt ominouſe, &amp; dextrous hād of Mr. Billarde, ordinarye Chyrurgiane to the King, and of Mr. Biron.
            And for an inventiō, or practice, vvhich vve might ſay to be vvholy agaynſt reaſon, amōgſt manye others more vvhich chaunced at Chartres: ther vvas the Chamberlayne of my Lord the Earle of Chiverny,An other Hiſtory. called the Pietmontois, vvho vvas vvoūded, on his heade vvith a raper, vvherby his Parietale vvas cleā reſcided throughe, yea &amp; clean through the Dura, &amp; Pia mater alſo, pearcing the depth of ones finger into the ſubſtāce of the Braynes: vvherof in the ſecond dreſſinge, cleane throughe the diſſolutione of the Craniū, ther iſſued out as much of his Braynes, as the quātity of the little finger in lōgitude, &amp; craſſitude therof: notvvithſtanding al this is he in the preſence of the right vvorſhipfull Mr. Le Febure, &amp; Duret, ſvvorne Phyſicions to the Kinge, &amp; other Doctours of this profeſſion out of Paris, vvhich are verye experte in Chyrurgerye, vvhich vveare alſoe aſſiſtantes in this diſeaſe, &amp; vvas of me completelye cured, vvithout havinge retayned any accidente, or impedimente therof: Divers Chyrurgians of the citye of Chartres ſtoode heerby, &amp; amongſt the reſt vvas Mr. Franſoys Cheaureau, &amp; Michel Fauveau.
            At the ſame time trepanede M Gabriell du Tertre,An other Hiſtory. a verye experte Chyrurgiane in all his operationes, a certayne vvomane vvhich vvas threeſcore yeare of age, or more, vvhoe hadde a fracture in her occipitalle partes of the heade: he hadde beſides her a little page, or lackye in handes, vvhoe hadde his Os Petroſum brokene &amp; ſplitte, and ſome parte of the Parietale. In like ſorte alſo trepaned Mr. Gillis Pillier, a moſt expert Chyrurgiane, a Tripeſeller, called Mr. Laurence, vvho had his membrane Dura matter cleft a ſunder: all vvhich foreſayed patientes have receaved theire complete reſanatione: vve muſt heer alſo farther note, that vvithin the ſpace of tvvo moneths therbefore all thoſe vvhich vveare vvounded in the Heade died, notvvithſtandinge all the ſecourſe vve coulde doe them yet for all that they dyed ſuddaynlye.
            All vvhich beinge noted, vve muſt attribute the deaths of ſoe manye valiant Capitaynes,Concluſione of the Apologye. &amp; vvorthy Lordes, and brave ſouldiours, on ſuch occaſions, and diſorders, and not on the fault as if they vveare inconvenientlye treacted, &amp; ſollicited, vvhether ether it vveare throughe yonge, or oulde Chyrurgians. Or els vve vvill conclude it rightlye, vvith the Aphoriſme, &amp; commō proverbe, it is allvvayes good Lucke, as lō
               ge as a man falleth not and breaketh his Necke.
            As Heſiodus ſayed, ſometimes is the day our mother, and ſometims our ſtepmother.
