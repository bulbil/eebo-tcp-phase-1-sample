            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               ADAM our Father being the firſt man,
               Through EVE his wife the which vile ſinne began:
               But God of his mercie thought it very good,
               We ſhould be fau'd through Chriſt our Sauiours blood.
            
            
               BEtimes in morning when thou do'ſt awake,
               Vnto the Lord ſee thou thy Prayers make:
               And after that then goe to thy Vocation,
               This is a way that leadeth to ſaluation.
            
            
               COmfort of comforts, none that I doe finde,
               So great as for to haue a conſtant minde:
               Truſting in God, and in his onely Sonne,
               Comfort of comforts like to this is none.
            
            
               DEath as a Sergeant commeth vnto all,
               Prepare thy ſelfe therefore againſt he call:
               For he that is prepared well to dye,
               Shall liue with Chriſt in heauen eternally.

                  y friend doe well,
               Enuie is a fiend that leadeth ſoules to hell:
               Through enuie Cain did ſlay Abell his brother,
               When on the earth there was not found another.
            
            
               FLie thou from ſinne, and eke from fond delight,
               And feare the Lord of heauen both day and night:
               For he that onely God the Lord doth feare,
               No euill euer to him may appeare.
            
            
               GIue laud vnto the Lord of heauen on high,
               Which made the earth, the ſea, and eke the skie:
               And men he made him onely for to ſerue,
               Then from his ſtatutes ſee thou doe not ſwerue.
            
            
               HAue mercy Lord on me I doe thee pray,
               And eke conduct me in thy holy way:
               And let thy precepts alwayes be to mee,
               As ſweet as euer hony from the Bee.
            
            
               IN thee, O Lord, I onely put my truſt,
               For thou, O Chriſt, art onely true and iuſt:
               There is no other God I know but thee,
               In whom I onely truſt ſaued to be.
            
            
               KNowledge a vertue is moſt excellent,
               If to know Chriſt the mind be onely bent:
               But not to know him, and know all beſide,
               No goodneſſe to the ſoule there can betide.
               LOue God, in him put all thy truſt and ſtay,
               Both day and night vnto him doe thou pray:
               And be not idle either day or night,
               So ſhalt thou pleaſe the Lord of heauen aright.
            
            
               MArke well my words, and ponder in your minde,
               And then no doubt but you ſhall comfort finde:
               Put truſt in Chriſt who for mankinde did die,
               So may'ſt thou liue with him continuallie.
            
            
               NO man there is that two Maſters can ſerue,
               To one he cleaues, from other he will ſwerue:
               He that on Mammon ſetteth his delight,
               He cannot ſerue the Lord of heauen aright.
            
            
               OMnipotent Lord, ſend to me thy grace,
               Here in this life, in heauen a dwelling place:
               And when my ſoule depart from body is,
               Grant me ſweet Chriſt to liue with thee in bliſſe.
            
            
               PVt all thy truſt and confidence in God,
               And he will guide thee with his holy rod:
               For he that truſts in him, and to him pray,
               Shall liue in bliſſe with him another day.
            
            
               QVit thou thy ſelfe alwayes from worldly care,
               And ſee that thou the Lord of heauen doe feare:
               For he that feares the Lord of heauen aright,
               Shall liue eternall with the Lord of might.
            
            
               REmember man that thou art borne to die,
               And not to liue on earth eternallie:
               Then liue on earth while here thou doe remaine,
               Though being dead, to liue with Chriſt againe.
            
            
               SInne not, but ſtand in awe of God the Lord,
               Who made the heauen, the earth, and ſea by word:
               The skie, the Sunne, the Moone, the Starres alſo,
               And euery creature that on earth doe goe.
            
            
               TRuſt thou in God the Father of all might,
               And pray vnto his Sonne both day and night:
               Intreat his Spirit may thee alwayes guide,
               So from his ſtatutes thou ſhalt neuer ſlide
