            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            MVRDER VPON MVRDER: OR, THE OLD WAY OF POYSONING NEWLY REVIVED.
            
               In the remarkeable Act of Alice Clarke, performed upon her Husband Fortune Clarke, by her, poysoned on Ascension day last past▪ for which being arraigned, convicted, and condemned, shee suffer'd by Fire in West-Smithfield, upon Wednesday in Whitsonweeke, being the 20. day of May, 1635. with the last words shee delivered at the time and place of her Execution.
               
            
            
               GReat and stupendious are the workes and wonders of the God Almighty, who onely searcheth the hearts and reines, and therefore perspicuously knoweth the very thoughts and strength of man: For bee his vaine apprehensions never so cunning to contrive, his policy to conceale, or his boldnesse to out-face any nefarious act committed, yet his unsounded and incomprehensible Wisedome, which can be no way circumscribed, is able at all times, and upon all occasions, as well to publish, as punish it in the open eye of the world, of which, as well those times past, as these present, have, and doe afford us remarkeable Examples: I will begin with the Sinne, before I proceed to the Fact.
            
               A Murderer, the Latines call Homicida, from home and caedo, id est, Hominem occidere, To kill a man: Now who the father of murder is, you may read in the Gospell of St. Iohn Chap. 8. Vers. 44. where our blessed Saviour speaking to the Pharisees, saith, Yee are of your father the Devill, and the lusts of your father yee will doe: He hath beene a murderer from the beginning, &amp;c. For the punishment thereof, read Gen. 9. vers. 5. For surely I will require your blood wherein your lives are, at the hand of every beast will I require it; and at the hand of man, even at the hand of a mans brother, will I require the the life of man: Who so sheddeth mans blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God hath hee made man, &amp;c. And Numb. 35. 31. Moreover, you shall take no recompence for the life of the murderer, which is worthy to dye, for he shall be put to death. That, for the punishment. Now for the execrablenesse of the Sin: We find in Gen. 4. 11. God speaking to Caine, after the slaughter of his Brother Abel, after this manner, Now therefore thou art cursed from the Earth, which hath opened her mouth to Receive thy brothers blood from thine hand: As also Deutronomy 27. 24. Cursed be hee that smiteth his neighbour secretly: And all the people shall say, so be it.
            
            If this monstrous sinne be so heynous in the sight of God, betwixt neighbour and neighbour, or if committed by one stranger upon another, how much more horrid appeareth it in his eyes; when the husband and Wife, who in the matrimoniall Contract, are no more too, but one flesh, shall barbarously and treacherously insidiate one anothers life. According to that verse of the Poet:
            
               Vivitur ex rapto, non hospes ab hospite tutus,
               Non socer a genero, fratrum quoque gratia rara est:
               
                  Immi
                     •
                  et exitio vir coniugis, illa mariti:
               Lurida terribiles miscent aconita noverci,
               Filius ante diem patrios inquirit in annos, &amp;c.
            
            which I have late read thus paraphras'd,
            
               All live on spoile, the guest is not secure
               In his Hosts house, nor is the Father sure
               Protected by the Sonne: even brothers iarre,
               True love and friendship is amongst them rare.
               The husband doth insidiate the wife,
               And she againe seekes to subplant his life:
               The rough-brow'd Step-dame her yong step-son hugs,
               Tempering for him (meane time) mortiferous drugs:
               The Sonne after the Fathers yeares enquires,
               And long before the day, his death desires, &amp;c.
            
            Such were the passages of those times there amongst the Heathens, when Christianity was not knowne, but that they should be so familiar and conversant with us, is the more to be pittied and lamented.
            In the flourishing State of Rome, there were many temperers of poyson, and these were call'd Venificae, which word wee apply too, and conferre upon, Effacination, Sorcery, and Witchcraft: Concerning which the Civill Lawes of the Empire thus speake, In institut. Iur. in fine in lege Cornelia, in the Cornelian Law, Et venifeci capite damnantur, qui artibus odiosis tam veneno, quàm susurris magicis homines occiderint, vel mala mede camenta publice vendiderint, that is, Let those be held guilty of capitall offence, who by odious and abhorrid Arts, as well by poyson, as by magicke spells and wisperings, shall kill any man: In which State are likewise included all such, who shall publickly sell any evill Confections: From which Canon we may ground three severall sorts of delinquents in this kind, which passe under the name of Venificium:
               
the first Poysoners, the second Sorcerers, or Witches, the third these Apothecaries or Empricks, who shall vend any mortiffarous drugs, knowing that by them any man or womans life, may bee infidiated, and in this case now in hand, though the seller (as he hath apparently justified himselfe may be excused, yet the byer as the Law hath openly convicted her, so we may presume that she is legally condemned.
            Now what the reason may be conjectured in these our latest, but worst dayes: that so many nefarious acts, equalling, if not farre surpassing these perpretated in former ages, should be new committed: as Catamatisme, Sodometry, Paracidy, many headed murders and the like: I can give no other reason then this, the contempt of the feare of God, and the neglect of his Sabbath.
            But to leave off all forraigne prodigious acts of the like horrid nature. Which as they are numerous, so they are manifest, in History and Chronologie, and go no further then our owne nation, and these latter dayes. Hath not one brother in the heat of Wine slame another in the Taverne? A sonne transpersed the very wombe in which he was conceived, and suffered for the fault upon the Gibbet? A man in his drunkennesse casts his knife upon his Wife, and missing her, pointed it into the brest of his innocent childe, and kild him dead in the instant: hath not the woman offered the like outtage, upon her husband in her fury, and left him dead in the place, and suffered lately for it, for remarkable example.
            Within the compasse of foureteene moneths or there abouts, one Enoch ap Evans, upon a small difference betwixt his brother and him, tooke the advantage

when he was asleepe cut his throat first, and after his head quite off with his knife, and when the mother hearing a busling above, came into the roome to heare the cause of such a noise, he prosecuted her downe the stayers, and afterwards cut of her head with an Hatchet, for which he was Apprehended, arraigned, convicted condemned at Shrewsbury, and after, some distance from the place executed.
            Since then, these grand Malefactors, who went commonly by the name of Country Tom and Canbery Besse, their fearefull murders upon three severall Gentlemen, at three sundry times, (the discourse of whose Actions, Examinations, Confession, and Sufferings, because they are already published to the view of the World, I will no longer insist upon, or make any Repetition of their hainous crimes to trouble the Reader. But to come nearer to the matter of this fact now in Agitation, I will onely remember you of Mistresse Arden, who caused her Husband to bee murdered in her owne House at Feversham in Kent, the memorable Cercumstances thereof deserving places in a most approoved Chronicle, may be very well spared in this short discourse. As also of Mistresse Page of Plimouth, who for poysoning her Husband, suffered with her sweet-heart Master George Strangwich, who had beene before time betrothed unto her: her husband being old, she yong, by which may be apprehended the misery of inforced marriage. But not to tire your patience I will onely trouble you with the poore wretched creature, who last suffered in Smithfield in this kinde, much commiserated, much lamented: give mee leave a little to to insist upon her cause, and compare it with this now in present.
            
               Her injuries, and harsh and unmanly usage spurred on by the instigations of the divell, almost compeld her to what she did; which, as they would be scarce modest for me to speake, so they were almost beyond the strength of Nature for her to suffer: shee being young and tender, he old and peevish; who notwithstanding his clownish behaviour, and churlish comportment towards her, as seldome or never affording her a smooth brow, or friendly countenance, used not onely to beat her with the next cudgell that came accidentally unto his hand, but often tying her to his bed-post to strip her and whippe her, &amp;c.
            But enough, if not too much of that; she then weary of so wretched a life, which she would have bin glad to be rid off, and loath in her modesty to▪ acquaint any friend or neighbour with her desperate purpose, who perhaps, (nay no doubt) by their good counsell might haue diuerted her from so wicked a resolution, and the divell with all catching hold upon so fit an opportunity to worke upon her weaknesse, she pondered with her selfe how she might end both their lives by poyson, which having provided and prepared to that end, shee first gave him part, and after resolved with her selfe to drinke the rest: But better motions now comming into her thoughts, and she truely repentant of what she had done, finding the confection begunne to work with him, fell downe before him upon her knees: First acknowledging the fact, then humbly desiring from him forgivenesse, with all, beseeching him to take some present Antidote to preserve his life, which was yet recoverable: on whom he sternly looking, as he lay in that Agony gasping betwixt life and death, returned her answere in this manner; nay thou Strumpet

and murderesse, I will receive no helpe at all but I am resolvd to dye and leave the world, be it for no other cause, but to have thee burnt at a stake for my death: which having said, and obstinate in that Hethenish resolution, he soone after expired. And this Resa
                  •
               ion I received from those of credite, who were well acquainted with the conditions of them both.
            I know not how to parallell these two: Her of whom I made this Short discourse, or this miserable woman, who suffered by fire in Smithfield upon wednesday in the Whitson weeke last, being the twentieth of May, Anno 1635. the passages of whose life, conviction, and death thus followes.
            
               
                  The free and voluntary Confession of Alice Clarke, the 18. day of May, 1635. concerning the Death of Fortune Clarke her husband, at the time she was in Prison.
                  
               
               A Iust cause, all persons may conjecture, was given on her part, of great dissensions likely to arise betweene her Husband and her selfe, unto selfe-will shee to be so addicted, disobediently to frequent the company of one White, of whom oftentimes her Husband hand had interdicted her his society and familiarity: which acquaintance of theirs was begun, before Clarke her Husband, entred into Marriage with her, and therefore with no small difficulty could be forgotten, or shaken off, such former ancient entertainments. No admonitions

or threats to either parties could prevaile, that proceeded from Clarke unto his wife, or unto White, of continuall private meetings betweene them: Which Clarke perceiving, outragiously fell from words unto blowes with his wife, the smart whereof she feeling, incontinently begot in her heart dislike, and resolution of revenge on her Husband Clarke for the same, a fit humour for the devill to worke on, and to her old friend White, to give occasion, not of dislike, but content to put in practice what she intended, which he might easily perceive by many pensive declamatitions, in private utter'd betweene themselves of her Husbands unkinde usage: The confirmation whereof appeares by the words that proceeded out of her owne mouth.
               First, she confessed, because she often companied with White, that stirred up her Husbands iust anger against White and her selfe.
               Secondly, that unawares unto them both, her Husband finding her and White shut up together privately in a Chamber in the house, on Ascension-day last in the afternoone, was thereat so with fury enraged, that hee did beate White going out of the doores, and after that, freshly fell foule upon her, and so cruelly added blowe upon blow upon her body, that the markes thereof were very visible on her body at this present. Her old Love, White, instantly taketh this unto heart, and in a rage (as she said) uttered these words, That it were better for one to be hanged, then to endure so discontented a life, and presently putting his hand into his pocket, he tooke out 4 Tokens, and gave them unto Alice Clarke, saying unto her, if he had had more money, hee would have given it unto her: which 4 Tokens so given unto

her, she went▪ unto Vxbridge forthwith, and that, afternoone bought a penny-worth of Mercury of an Apothecary in Vxbridge, intending the same unto her Husband, with a further reservation, that if her Husband had not taken it, she would have administred the same unto herselfe, and so put an end unto all her sorrows, as she vainely supposed.
               Thirdly, she said, that she was not the cause of her Husbands death, because shee gave not unto him the poyson whereof he died, but he tooke it himselfe violently out of her pockets, which her Husband had rifled, upon hope to finde some chinke or money there: but of such hopes he altogether was disappointed and deluded. Whether this be not a lame excuse, or strange delusion, I referre it unto the censure of the Judicious; and no further discovery of the fact, could I get from her at that time.
               Shee further said, that on Ascension-day her husband violently attempted to drowne himselfe, which shee prevented by her language upon him: but in short space afterwards dyed that Night of the Mercury, taken by himselfe out of her pocket, as afore-said.
               Fourthly, shee seemed to be very much afflicted in conscience, that shee was a yeare since gotten with Child by her Master, with whom shee last dwelt withall▪ who perceiving the same, with a small summe of money, matched her unto Fortune Clarke her Husband, about Alhallontide last, whom she could not love, or have any matter of maintenance, but relied upon her Masters former promises for the same: and hee fayling of giving her meanes, fell into folly and wickednesse. A great clog unto such a mans conscience, if it be true; to seduce a woman unto his will, and so leave her.
            
            
               
               A SHORT TRACT VPON THE hainousnesse of Poysoning.
               
               THough there be sundry sorts of Murther with their severall degrees, as open, or secret, acted upon a friend, a stranger, or ones selfe, yet in my opinion, I know not any of them which containes so much villany, neither including so many deepe circumstances in them, as that of poysoning: That I thinke is the reason that there are so few examples of it in Holy writ, this way either being then not knowne; followed, or practised; therefore to descrbe the quality of it and to aggravate it, I must wish you to consider these foure things.
               First, the Duplicem modum, secondly, the Duplicem effectum: Modus prior, the first Manner, Deliberando, Meditando, Is an Act done by Deliberation, or Meditation, no waies carried, and hurried by the violence either of will or of passion, but done upon a cold blood, and not seldome upon fixed resolutions.
               
                  Modus posterior, Celando, obtegendo, by a secret intent to hide it and conceale it from God if it were possible, so it is to the Patient under the shadow of some Physicke, or other medicine, coloured with an outward shew of an honest intent, and as far as they can from the Publick Magistrate; or else to make a distance of time, either to excuse themselves, or flye away from the hands of Justice: though,

                  
                     
                        〈1 line〉
                     
                  
               
               Secondly, Effectus prior, sensus 
                        〈◊〉
                      by changing, stupifying, or absolutely taking away the senses, and depraving the operative Organs of the soule, and sometimes infecting all the principles of life; as the head, the heart, and the liver, howsoever altering and overthrowing the frame and constitution of mans body in generall, and making him unfit for a prepararation of himselfe for death, though it be upon him, so that without the speciall Mercy of God, the party thus abused, dyes without either knowledge of his sinnes, or repentance for them.
               Secondly, Effectus posterior, creaturarum abusus, the abusing of the Creatures, contrary to the end of their Creation: They▪ being brought forth for the use and health of Mans Body, by this meanes they are made deadly, nay this manner of killing any, makes not onely the prime Agent guilty, but infects, and makes guilty others too; or at least, causes them to be examined strictly by the Magistrate: so that howsoever their good name for the present, is blotted and blemished, and what more is, they have but two wayes to comfort themselves, the first, is the witnesse of their owne Consciences Integrity, the second, is the Judges knowledge of their Innocence and Ignorance, by a prudent examination, of the fact perpetrated by all circumstances, and suspicious Arguments: And in this kinde the Apothecary for selling, the Messengers for buying, the Composers of it, and the deliverers of it to the party, stand in an hazard either of their lives, or fortunes, or both.
               Laying aside all these together, I hope it will easily appeare what a haynous sinne it is, when it is thus committed

first, with Deliberation: Secondly; with Secresie: Thirdly, with disabling the party to fit himselfe for mercy, and with the abusing the blessings of God and their owne knowledge: and lastly, for bringing others into danger as well as themselves, yet what is more, all this done under the Gospell; and often, as at this present, against one whose life, credit, goods, and good name, the offender ought to cherish and maintaine to the uttermost: So I may take up that saying of Iacob to his two Sonnes, My soule come not into their secrets, neither bee ioyned with their assemblies: nor have to doe with their practises, whose conclusions are so deepely dyed with the blood of Innocents.
            
            
               
                  
                     The second Confession of Alice Clarke this 10. day of May, 1635. at the place of Execution, concerning the poysoning of her husband, Fortune Clarke.
               
               PHysitians of the Soule ought to immitate those learned Physitians of the body, frequent visitations of those sicke patients, whose diseases are desperate and inveterate; and sometimes it chanceth, that they must desire, necessity so requireth, the advice and sound opinions of others their Colleagues. Even thus it happened betweene this obdurate Malefactor and my selfe, who in Adultery was so Rooted, and insensible of the heavy burthen, and most intollerable plagues insuing for it. That at the first and second times of my visiting of her, little or no Repentance I found in her, or her heart to be touched for her

most horrid clamorous crimes. This is apparant, if you compare her first confession unto this, how different in truth, how improbable the one are unto the other; nay what she confessed on Munday, shee was so far off to proceede in a further revealing of her selfe, that what touched her home, concerning her husbands death, she would have denied, though formerly confessed by her most confidently true.
               I was thereuppon inforced to hold her unto it, and to extract the truth, and trye her spirit, called two of the Keepers of the Goale, to her unknowne, whom I appoynted to obserue and remember the speeches that passed betweene us, to verifie them unto her face, which attestation both of my selfe, and of them, shee would out-face, but could not.
               Vppon Wensday morning, on which shee was executed, there assembled unto Newgate multitudes of people to see her, and some conferred with her, but little good they did on her, for shee was of a stout angry disposition, suddainly inraged, if you began to touch her to the quicke of her husband poysoning. Being that morning of her death accompanied and also assisted by divers of my worthy, grave, and learned brethren in the Ministery, before and at the time of her Execution, for which I doe most heartily thanke them, but that God whose worke it was, their reward for it with him is layd up in store. Like my selfe, they stood as men amazed, to perceive that none of theirs, or any other serious perswasions could for a great while prevayle with her, ioyned in opinion with me, that she was no fitting guest for the Table of the Lord Iesus thereupon, I made as though I would have excluded her thence, in denying the benefit of the holy Communion, of the

Body and Blood of Jesus Christ, inferring the benefit of the unspeakeable blesse, by the worthy receiving of it by Repentance and Faith, and the most woefull malediction to all impenitent and unworthy receivers. Whereupon, it pleased God, so to mollifie her heart, that teares from her eyes, and truth from her tongue proceeded, as may appeare by this her ensuing Confession at the very Stake, where she was executed, unto Mr. Cordall, She riffe of London, relating the same with as loud and audible a voice, as possible she could, that many others besides, there present, were also witnesses of such her ensuing Confession.
               First she confessed that Henry White, who was arraigned as a party with her, consenting unto her Husbands death, did give unto her one Ascension day in the after noon, foure brasse tokens, advising her therewith to goe and buy one penyworth of Mercury, and give it unto her Husband, saying, if that her husband were dead, she should live more quietly and contentedly with him, &amp; after such his death, that he the said White would marry with her; whereupon she went unto Vxbridge, and that afternoone bought the Mercury.
               
               Secondly, shee confessed that her Master got her with childe a yeare since, which was her overthrow, and mediated for the Marriage, betweene her and her Husband, whom shee could not love, nor no way affect. By her Masters perswasion, who sent her up to London to be Married, and payed the costs thereof, and further promised her maintenance during her life, if she did condescend unto his desiers, which were most unlawfull, dishonest, and unchaste, before and after her Marriage, with Fortune Clarke her Husband.
               Thirdly, shee confessed, that one of Hillinden inticed

her, to run away from her Husband, with him beyond the Seas, and that she did lodge in that mans house, and lay with him a whole fortnight, and speaking unto him of her Husband, that shee would not forsake him, hee thereupon advised her to pop him up with white bread and milke, and to put some thing else into it, to choak or stuffe up his throat.
               Fourthly she confessed, for the Mercury which she bought, shee intended it unto her Husband, but having no conuenient opportunity to dispose of it, she put it into her sleeve, which her Husband as she said tooke it out of her hand, and then being over charged with drink he immediatly swallowed it down, which she perceiving, was thereat so perplexed, that she uttred these words unto her Husband, that he had undone both him selfe and her.
               And heere give me leave to note unto the World, what a deale of comfort she found, after shee had disburdned her loaded conscience by confession, beeing demaunded at the same instant of her death, yea, or nay; that after such her confession, shee was by it the better prepared unto death, with comfort, and willingnesse to suffer the same: Shee thus replyed with harty thankefulnesse unto God, that shee had better resolutions unto death, then formerly she had, and by her countenance, which was very ruddy confirmed her inward new begotten chearfulnesse, and that with harty prayer, and sweet tone of voice, surrenderd her soule into the hands of the Lord Iesu, who will have mercy on whom he will have mercy, unto whom wee all stand and fall.
               Heere is nothing contained in her confession, but that which true, and what she uttered with her owne mouth; which I was a witnesse off.
