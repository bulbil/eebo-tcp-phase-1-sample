            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               Iudgement of peace: which Hier. Comment lib. 2. in Zac. cap. 8. Saint Hierom thus expounds, Hoc eſt judicium pacis ut propoſitum Iudex habeat pacificare diſcordes. This is no ſmall difficulty, ſince according to the ſame Hier. Comment. lib. 1. in Eſa. cap. 1.

               ; But, my good Lord, leaſt telling the truth of your ſelfe may ſeeme flattery to others, and flattery neither ſorts with your diſpoſition, nor becomes my profeſsion, give mee leave in mine high eſteeme of your Honour, and humble expreſsion of mine affection, to publiſh my poore paines under your honourable name: wiſhing I were able,

For, whatſoever my weakeneſſes bee, are not theſe times ſeaſonable (I would they were not) for ſuch a Subject as is here handled, Treatiſes of Plague and Famine, yea and of Warre too? For, though by the Prudence &amp; Providence of our royall Soveraigne, Sonne and Heire of the great Peace-maker, 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                warre be kept out of our land: yet in other parts of Christendome, it, and the reſtrage like over-flowing flouds, to the ruine of many States and of true Religion. The Lion hath roared, who will not feare? The Lord God hath ſpoken, who can but propheſie? Yet are theſe Treatiſes neither to terrifie for what is paſt, nor to propheſie of what is yet to come; but rather to heale the wounds that have beene made by the fore-intimated arrowes, and to direct us how to keepe the Lord from further ſhooting out the like. It is the part of us Miniſters of Gods Word, out of his Word to declare what he intendeth and expecteth when he ſmileth, or frowneth on his people. Magiſtrates (who by reaſon of their places, are in Canaans language

Of the Treatiſes thus commended to your honourable Patronage, gracious acceptance is in all humility craved by him that profeſſeth himſelfe to be.

               Right Honourable, Right Worſhipfull, Beloved,
            
            
               BEhold here a Teſtimony of my due Reſpect to you. Behold here an Apology for my ſeeming Neglect of you. I do acknowledge that all the Reſpect which by a gratefull Paſtor may be due to a loving People, is by me due to you. In that reſpect, I do here Treatiſes preſented to my pariſhioners.

                the fourth time give publike teſtimony thereof by preſenting to you in ſpeciall that which is made publike to all. The neglect of you, objected againſt me, is, my ſeldome preaching among you this laſt yeare. This ancient, undeniable aphoriſme, Vltra poſſe non eſt eſſe: ncc velit quidem. 
               A man can do no more then he can, giveth a juſt anſwer thereto. Great hath beene the weakeneſſe of my body, firſt occaſioned by a very dangerous diſeaſe in Auguſt laſt (how low I was brought thereby,

many of you are witneſſes) and further increaſed by two relapſes, one in Nov. the other in Febr. following. (Of Gods goodnes in my recoveries I ſhall have fit occaſion to ſpeake on The Saints Sacrifice, ſhortly to be tendred unto you.) Had I no other excuſe, this 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ; Chryſ. Hom. 1. in cap. 1. ad Tit. were ſufficient. Saint Chryſostome, where he granteth that by the weakeneſſe of Miniſters bodies the Churches commodities may be intercepted, concludeth that Miniſters in ſuch caſes are not to be blamed. But howſoever my weakeneſſe were a juſt impediment to preaching (whereby the ſpirits of a feeble man are much exhauſted) yet would I not make it a pretext for waſting precious time in idleneſſe. It was wittily and gravely ſaid, 
                  Cavendum &amp; in ocio ocium eſt. Bern de Conſid. l. 3. c. 13. Scipio Africanus dicere ſolebat Nunquam ſe minus ocioſum quam cum ociooſus eſſet. Cic. Offic. lib. 3. 
               Even in leiſure laſineſse is to be ſhunned. Worthy therefore of all to be imitated is he, who made that uſe of freedome from publique affaires, as he ſet himſelfe more cloſe to his private ſtudies, and thereupon was wont to ſay that, He was never leſse at leiſure then when he was most at leiſure: Anſwerably (according to the abilitie which God gave me) I endeavoured to ſpend that ceſſation which I had from publike imployments, in my priuate ſtudies, ſo as ſome fruit thereof might redound to you and others. By this my true and juſt apology, I hope the fore-mentioned ſeeming neglect of you, appeares to be but ſeeming, Concerning the ſubject matter of my private paines now made publike, though I had by me ſundry treatiſes heretofore preached in your eares, which might with more eaſe have beene laid againe before your eyes: yet the manifeſtation of Gods diſpleaſure againſt us and other parts of the Chriſtian world,

               evill arrowes (ſo called in regard of their evill effects) Plague, Famine, Sword, hath drawne my thoughts to meditate thereon, and to publiſh what in mine ordinary courſe of Miniſtry I have not had occaſion to preach. Indeed on ſpeciall occaſions I have out of the pulpet delivered ſome of the points handled in theſe Treatiſes: but I never finiſhed any of them. It is without queſtion a point of prudence to eye the divine Providence in all things. For 
                  Maieſtati divinae gubernatio pariter &amp; adminiſtratio univerſitatis incumbit. Bern ſuper. Cant. Ser. 68. by it without all contradiction are all things thorowout the whole world governed and diſpoſed: eſpecially the affaires of his Church: on which ſometimes the light of his favour brightly ſhineth: other-times haile-ſtones of indignation are ſhowred downe. By a due obſervation hereof may our diſpoſition to God be ſo ordered, as that, which God expecteth, be effected: namely Gratulation for his Favours: Humiliation for his Iudgements. Now are the times wherein clouds of Gods anger have obſcured the bright skie of the Church. Pertinent therefore to the preſent times are the Treatiſes following, and in that reſpect the more profitable to us of theſe times. Quo magis quid accomodum, eo magis commodum eſt. 
               The more pertinent a point is, the more profitable it is. I could wiſh that there were not ſo juſt occaſion of treating of the fore-ſaid three arrowes, as there is. We have felt the bitterneſſe of the plague within theſe ſix yeares more then in many hundred yeares before in this land: which arrow is now againe ſhot againſt us: and how farre the venime thereof (for it is a venimous arrow) may infect, who knowes? Both the Palatinates, Bohemia, Moravia, Sileſia, Hungaria, and almoſt all Germany:
               
               The generall Hiſtory of France hath a catalogue of 99 townes and places of Oſtage for them of the religion, reduced in theſe late warres. 
               Rochel, Montauban, Monpellier, Neſmes, and other townes, cities, and countries in France: Bredaw in the Low Countries, and many other places in Chriſtendome, have felt the deepe wound of warre, whereby Idolatry hath thruſt out Piety, Superſtition is ſet in the roome of Religion, Vſurpers have entred upon the rites of the true Lords and Inheritours, the bloud of many millions hath beeneſhed, more have beeneexiled, and all things turn'd upſide downe. S. Auguſtine in his time complained that the outrages of the Clergy of the Donatiſts ſo waſted the 
                  Clericorum Donatiſtarum latrocinia ſic vaſtant Eccleſias, ut Barbarorum fortaſſe ſacta mitiora ſiat. Aug. Epiſt. 122. Churches, that Barbarians dealings might ſeeme to be more mild. How much more juſtly may we take up that complaint againſt the Popiſh Clergy, Ieſuites, Monks, Prieſts, Friers, and the reſt of that rabble? As for Famine, it begins to invade all Chriſtendome: ſo as one country cannot be helpfull to another, as they have been in former times. Corne hath not been ſo deare among us, as now it is, in any living mans memory. How far this Famine begun may proceed and to what extremities it may bring both our, and other countries, no man can tell. Is it not now time for Plaisters to be made for the Plague, Proviſion to be procured againſt Dearth, and Protection provided againſt the Sword? Such are the evils of theſe Arrowes, as to determine which of them is the leaſt evill, is not eaſie. I am ſure, that the leaſt of them is ſo evill, as there is juſt cauſe to uſe all the meanes that poſſibly we can to prevent or remove it. To theſe purpoſes tend the Treatiſes here tendred to you. In them ye ſhall find (beſide ſundry other uſefull points) the extremities of, and remedies for

                     THis firſt particle AND, being a copulative, knitteth this upon the former Hiſtory, as a conſequence juſtly following thereon. Now in the former Hiſtory the Sinne of the people is laid downe. For after that the Lord had manifeſted his fierce wrath againſt Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, with thoſe that tooke part with them, by cauſing the earth to ſwallow up ſome of them alive, and by ſending forth a fire to conſume other of them, the people that ſaw theſe fearefull ſpectacles of Gods vengeance, were ſo farre from feare and trembling, as moſt audaciouſly, and preſumptuouſly they murmured and gathered themſelves together againſt Moſes and Aaron, as the other, who were before deſtroyed, had done. Hereby the Lord was provoked to adde, to the former judgements, the Plague here noted in my text. So as they added ſinne to ſinne: and the Lord added 
                           Sequentium acceſſione ad majorem ſe contemptum, peccatum extollit. Chryſ. Hom. 22. ad Pop. judgement to judgement. For their ſinne therefore the Lord plagued them. For by the multiplication of ſinne, they grew into a greater contempt then before.
                     The title here given to God, and tranſlated, the LORD, is Gods proper name See the Churches Conqueſt on Exo. 17. 15. §. 72.

                     Gods ſpeaking, here mentioned, implieth an extraordinary manifeſtation of his mind; and that ſo evidently as a man doth when he ſpeaketh to another, and thereby declareth his meaning.

                     Three eſpeciall obſervations are here moſt remarkeable.
                     
                        I. Iudgements are conſequents of ſinne. The inference of this Plague upon the peoples ſinne gives evidence hereto.
                        II. God foretels what he intends against ſinners. For Gods ſpeaking here mentioned was a foretelling of that he intended againſt the rebellious Iſraelites.
                        
                        III. God reveales his mind to his Miniſters. Moſes to whom God here ſpeakes was his Miniſter. His Miniſter to governe, and to inſtruct his people.

                        IVdgements are conſequents of ſinne. Take a view of the judgements recorded in Scripture, and you may eaſily find ſinne to be the cauſe of all. The firſt that ever was inflicted on a creature was 2 Pet. 2. 4. 
                        the caſting downe of Angels into hell: But theſe are expreſly ſaid to be Angels that ſinned.

                        Becauſe thou haſt done this thou art curſed: In like manner to Adam, 
                        —17.

                        Heb. 3. 17. the judgements in the wilderneſſe, Iudg 2. 20. in the time of the Iudges, and afterwards, were all for ſinne. But not to inſiſt on more particulars in a caſe ſo cleare, the Wiſeman expreſly ſaith, Pro▪ 13. 6. The kinde of Iobs afflictiōs. 
                        wickedneſſe overthroweth the ſinner. He that acknowledgeth this, commendeth the juſtice of God.
                     
                        Ob. Sore judgements fell upon Iob: yet were they not conſequents of ſinne.
                     
                        Anſw. 1. Surely Iob was not free from all ſinne: 1 King. 8. 46. Sancti in medio tribulationis peccata ſua conſitebantur, pro quibus ſe aigne &amp; juſtè humiliari. noverant. Aug. Epiſt. 122 ad Victor. de afflict piorum. 
                        For there is no man that ſinneth not. Before ſinne ſeazed on man, he was free from all judgement: and as free ſhall he be, when againe he ſhalbe without ſinne. Therefore Saints in their afflictions have confeſſed their ſinnes, for which they knew they were deſervedly and juſtly humbled.
                     
                        
2. Diſtinction muſt be made betwixt judgements. Some are 1 Pet. 1. 7. Iam. 1. 3. See §. 49. for evidence, proofe, and exerciſe of ſuch graces as God hath endued men withall. Others are for puniſhments of ſinne: and they either 2 Chro. 33. 12 to bring a ſinner to repentance, or Iud. Verſ. 7. to make him an example of juſt vengeance. The judgements which befell Iob were of the firſt kinde. The judgements intended in the point in hand are of the latter kinde.
                     The direct contrariety that is betwixt ſinne and Gods purity, on the one ſide: and Gods holy jealouſie, and perfect Why judgements follow ſinne. hatred of ſinne, his impartiall juſtice, his truth in executing what he threatneth, his care to keepe others from being inſected, his wiſdome in ſtopping the mouth of ſuch as are puniſhed, and the many ill conſequences that might follow upon ſinnes impunity, on the other ſide: as they hold judgements from ſuch as by their impenitency pull them not upon their owne pates, ſo they haſten judgements on notorious ſinners.

THE charge which God gave to Ioſhua (when he Search cut cauſe of judgement. and the men of Iſrael with him fled before the men of Ai) to ſearch out and take away from among them the accurſed thing, affordeth a direction very pertinent to the point in hand: which is, when we ſee any judgement hanging over our heads, or feele it fallen upon us, to ſearch narrowly and thorowly after the cauſe of that judgement. Nothing doth uſually ſo bring mens ſinnes to mind and memory, as judgements. Inſtance the example of Ioſephs brethren,

                        Let us ſearch and trie our wayes. Vpon a like occaſion, which was a manifeſtation of Gods diſpleaſure by viſible judgements, the Apoſtle giveth this advice, 1 Cor. 11. 31. 
                        Let a man examine himſelfe.
                     
                     If the judgements be publicke, it wilbe uſe-full in

our ſearch to proceed after this manner.
                     1. Obſerve what are the moſt common and publike ſins What ſinnes eſpecially to be thought cauſes of judgement. of that place or people where the fire of Gods wrath appeareth. Theſe were the ſinnes which God himſelfe did as it were with the finger thus point out to his Prophet, Ier. 7. 17. 
                        Seeſt thou not what they doe in the Cities of Iudah, and in the ſtreets of Ieruſalem?
                     
                     2. Marke how farre ſuch ſinnes are winked at, and tolerated by Magiſtrates and Miniſters. For this provoketh God to take the ſword into his owne hands; whence proceed publique and fearefull judgements. Inſtance 1 Sam. 3. 13. 
                        Elies caſe.
                     3. Conſider how farre the contagion of thoſe publique ſinnes ſpreadeth it ſelfe. For when the infection of a ſinne is diffuſed all abroad, farre and neare, the Lord is forced to ſend ſome publique judgement, thereby, as it were with a fire to purge the aire. Dan. 9. 11. 
                        All Iſrael have tranſgreſſed (ſaith Daniel) therefore the curſe is powred upon us.
                     
                     4. See how farre they that profeſſe Religion do yeeld to the corruption of the times. For theſe by their ſinnes much incenſe Gods wrath, becauſe they eſpecially cauſe the name of God to be blaſphemed. Witneſſe 2 Sam 12. 14. Rom. 2. 24. 
                        David. The Gen. 6. 2. commixtion of Sonnes of God with Daughters of men cauſed the Deluge.
                     5. Eſpecially let every one examine himſelfe, and ſearch out his owne ſinnes: and take due notice how farre he hath followed the ſway of the times, and yeelded to the iniquity thereof. Every one ought moſt to ſuſpect himſelfe: and to feare leſt his ſins among and above others, have incenſed the fire of Gods wrath. Every one (if he take due and thorow notice of himſelfe) may know more evill of himſelfe, then he can juſtly ſuſpect of others. For men know their owne inward parts: their very thoughts and imaginations: in which reſpect though others commit more outward groſſe enormities then themſelves, yet they are privy to ſuch a ſea of corruptions in themſelves, that they have every one cauſe to ſay, 1 Tim. 1. 15. 
                        Of ſinners I am the chiefe.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 5. Of the courſes to be taken when ſinne is found out.
                     2. SInnes the cauſe of judgement being by ſuch ſearching found out, we may not ſuffer them to remaine, and continue to enflame Gods wrath: but as we deſire to have that fire goe out, ſo we muſt pull away this fuell. So long as How Gods wrath may be ſlaked. fire hath fuell to worke on, it will not go out: but rather be more and more hot. Now fuell is pulled away from Gods wrath,
                           1. When the ſoule is prickt, and pierced with ſinne: when godly ſorrow is wrought in the heart: 2 Cor. 7. 9. ſuch a ſorrow as was wrought in the Corinthians.
                           
                           2. When upon that touch of heart, true confeſſion of ſinne is made to God. 1 Ioh 1. 9. 
                              If we confeſſe our ſinnes, God is faithfull to forgive us our ſinnes. 
                              2 Sam 12. 13. 
                              Nathan on this ground pronounced pardon to David.
                           
                           3. When upon ſuch confeſſion the mind is otherwiſe diſpoſed then it was before: loathing the ſinnes which before it loved: as Luk. 7. 38. ſhe that made a towell of her haire, which had before beene laid out to proclaime her luſt.
                           4. When that loathing works a true and reſolved purpoſe never to returne to thoſe ſinnes againe. As he that ſaid, Pſal. 39. 1. 
                              I will take heed unto my wayes.
                           
                           5. When this purpoſe for the more ſure performing of it, is ratified by ſolemne promiſe, vow and covenant. Hereof we have a worthy patterne of the Iewes in Neh. 9. 38. 
                              Nehemiahs time.
                           6. When faithfull endeavour is anſwerable to ſuch purpoſes, promiſes, vowes and covenants: as he that ſaid, Pſal. 56. 12. 
                              Thy vowes are upon me, O Lord. As the bond of a Creditor to whom a man that meanes honeſtly is bound, ſo lies on the debter, that he is not quiet till it be diſcharged, ſo was the vow which he had made to God, upon him.
                           
                           7. When above all, remiſſion and reconciliation is heartily ſought of God, and ſtedfaſtly believed. This is principally

intended by the attonement hereafter to be ſpoken of.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 6. Of the caſes wherein we must ſeeke to ſlake Gods wrath.
                     THE foreſaid courſe for averting judgement is to be taken,
                           1. When the fire of Gods wrath flameth about our eares, and bath conſumed many before our eyes, as 2 Sam. 24. 15. the Plague did in Davids time.
                           2. When there is but a ſmoake which ſheweth that fire is kindled though it flame not forth: as when Moſes heard God ſay, Exo. 32. 10. 
                              Let me alone, that my wrath may waxe hot against them, &amp;c. Threatnings of judgement are to Gods wrath, as ſmoake is to fire. Such ſmoake made the Ninevites repent. Ion. 3. 5.
                           
                           3. When we obſerve cauſes that may kindle and enflame Gods wrath to abound, as all manner of notorious ſinnes. They were the ſinnes of the people which made Luk. 19. 41. 
                              Chriſt weepe over Ieruſalem. By them he gathered that heavy vengeance muſt needs fall upon her.
                           4. Though we apparently ſee no flame, nor ſmoake, nor notorious cauſe: yet when we have juſt cauſe to ſuſpect and feare all, or any of theſe. Thus it is noted of Iob 1. 5. 
                              Iob, that when the dayes of his childrens feaſting were gone about, he ſent and ſanctified them, &amp;c. For Iob ſaid, it may be that my ſons have ſinned, &amp;c. Becauſe he ſuſpected that they might have provoked Gods wrath, he uſed meanes to pacifie the ſame.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 7. Of putting away ſinne for removing judgement.
                     THE fore-mentioned point concerning the removing of Gods judgements doth now in particular, and after an eſpeciall manner concerne us, The ſecond of Iuly 1625 was the firſt day appointed for a publique faſt when there died in that weeke 405 of the Plague. who are even in the flame of the fire of Gods wrath; and thereupon aſſembled together by faſting and prayer after a more then ordinary manner

to ſeeke grace and favour of God; that ſo this day of humiliation may prove a day of reconciliation. For this end we are this day to enter into a ſolemne covenant with God: and as we deſire to have this hot fire of the Plague or extinguiſhed or at leaſt ſlaked, ſo to remove the cauſes which have kindled the ſame, ſo farre as we can find them out. When the Iewes after the captivity on a day of faſt entred into a new covenant with God, Ezr. 10. 3. Neh. 9. 2. they put away their ſtrange wives and children, becauſe in taking them they ſinned, and to hold them had beene to continue in ſinne. In like manner, though we be wedded to our ſinnes as to wives, and our ſinnes be as deare as wives and children can be, yet muſt they be put away: els nor our perſons, nor our prayers, nor any ſervices that we performe, can be acceptable to God. Sinnes retained are as that Exo. 15. 23. 
                        bitterneſſe which was on the waters in Marah, which made them that they could not be drunken: and as that 2 King. 6. 5. 
                        heavineſſe on the axe head which made it ſinke in the water: and as that Lam. 3. 44. 
                        thick cloud, whereof the Prophet thus ſaith, our prayer cannot paſſe thorow it. Yea as thoſe 2 King. 4. 39. 
                        wilde gourds which brought death into the pot. But faith and repentance are as the tree which was caſt into the waters and made them ſweet: as the ſtick which being caſt into the water made the iron ſwimme: as the winde which driveth away a thick cloud; and as the meale which made the pottage wholeſome. Wherefore as 
                           Sanè ubi prorſus de medio actum ſuerit omne peccatum, cauſa qui dem omnino ſublata, nec ipſe quoque deinceps manebit effectus. Bernard, in Pſal. 91. Serm 10. we deſire to have our perſons, prayers, and other ſervices acceptable to God, and the fierceneſſe of this peſtilence to aſſwage, yea this and other judgements to be removed, let us take away the cauſe of all: let us put away our ſinnes. The cauſe being taken away, the effect will quickly follow.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 8. Of Gods foretelling judgements.
                     II. See §. 2. 
                        GOD foretels what he intends againſt ſinners. This he did by Gen 6 14. preparing an arke before the floud came: by —19. 1. ſending Lot into Sodom before it was conſumed: by Exo. 5. 1. ſending Moſes and Aaron to Pharaoh before his land was plagued: and by 2 Chro 36. 15. raiſing up Prophets, and ſending them time after time to the Iſraelites.
                     
                     This God doth to draw men, if it be poſſible, to repentance: as Ier. 26 18, 19. 
                        Hezekiah and his people; and Ion. 3 5. Captivitas Iudae orum praedicitur ventura, ut eum vencrit non caſu accidiſſe videa tur, ſcd irá Dei. Hieron Comment in Ioel 1. Gods patience. the King of Niniveh with his people, were wrought upon by this meanes, and judgement prevented: or els to make men the more inexcuſable, and to juſtifie Gods ſeverity againſt men; and to give evidence that the judgements which fall on men come not by chance, but from God.
                     1. Hereby have we evidence of Gods long-ſuffering. He thinks not of wrath till he be exceedingly provoked. Therefore he is ſaid to be Ion. 4. 2. 
                        ſlow to anger. And when he is provoked to take vengeance, he threatens before he ſtrikes. For Lam 3. 33. 
                        he doth not afflict willingly. He ſaies it, and ſweares it, Ezek. 33. 11. 
                        I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked. And well we may believe him that he is ſo flow to take vengeance: for vengeance is to him Iſa 28. 21. Extraneum factam ſuum, all enum opus ſuum; Peregrinum eſt opus ab eo. Hieron in hunc locum. 
                        his ſtrange worke, his ſtrange act: a worke and act whereunto he is in a manner forced: which he would not do, if otherwiſe he could maintaine his honour. They therefore on whom judgement falleth, have cauſe to confeſſe unto God, and ſay, Dan 9 7. Hardneſſe of mans heart. 
                        O Lord, righteouſneſſe belongeth unto thee, but unto us confuſion of faces: for we have not hearkned, &amp;c.
                     2. This manner of Gods proceeding with ſinners gives demonſtration of the irard and impenitent heart of man, that will not be brought to yeeld. Fitly is ſuch an heart ſtiled Ezek. 11. 19 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
                         
                        an heart of ſtone. For a ſtone may be broken to peeces, yea beaten to powder, but never will it be made ſoft: ſo ſuch mens hearts may be confounded with Gods judgements, but will never be mollified nor made pliable to his will.

If threatnings, or predictions of judgements could worke on 
                           Calamitas praedicitur ventura, ut agente populo paenitentiam non veniat, que ventura eſt, ſi permanſ

                              rit in delictis. Hieron. in Ioel. 1. ſuch, God would never worke his ſtrange worke. Iudgements are foretoid to come, that people repenting, judgements might not come, which yet will come as they are foretold if people continue in ſinne. Reade and conſider, Ier. 26. 18, 19, &amp;c.
                  
                  
                     §. 9. Of Gods making knowne his mind to his Miniſters.
                     III. See §. 2. 
                        GOD reveales his mind to his Miniſters. So he did to Gen. 6. 13. 
                        Noah, 
                        —18. 17. 
                        Abraham, 
                        Exo. 3. 8. 
                        Moſes, and other his Prophets. To omit other particulars, in this caſe it is thus indefinitely ſaid, Am. 3. 7. Non faciet Deus verbum niſi revelaverit Prophetis; non quo omnia revelet Prophetis quae in coelo faciat, ſed quae facturus in terris ſit. Hier. in Am. 3. Lege plura ibid. Hac de re. 
                        Surely the Lord God will doe nothing, but he revealeth his ſecret to his ſervants the Prophets.
                     
                     Not for their owne ſakes onely doth God manifeſt his purpoſe to his Miniſters, but that they may declare to others what is made knowne to them. On this ground ſaith the Lord to his Prophet, Ezek. 3 17. Gods providence and prudence in mans miniſtry. Ezo 20 19. Luk 1. 12. 
                        Heare the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me. Now by this meanes of manifeſting his minde, the ministry of man, God ſheweth his providence and prudence.
                     1. His providence, in ordaining ſuch a meanes as is fitteſt for mans infirmity: For man can beſt endure man to ſpeake unto him, and to declare what is meet for him to know: When God himſelfe delivered his ten Oracles to the people, they were ſo affrighted, as they ſaid unto Moſes, ſpeake thou with us, and we will heare: but let not God ſpeake with us, leſt we die. Yea when Zachariah an ancient Prieſt ſaw an Angell that brought unto him a gladſome meſſage, he was troubled and feare fell upon him.
                     
                     2. His Prudence, in ordaining ſo meane a meanes as will make triall of mans reſpect to God: whether he will give credence and yeeld obedience to Gods Word, becauſe it is Gods Word, for the Lords ſake, rather then for the meſſengers ſake. For this are the Theſſalonians commēded, becauſe 
                        1 Theſ. 2. 13. 
                        when they received the Word of God which they heard of men,
                        
                        they received it not as the word of men, but as the word of God.
                     
                     O let us in like manner teſtifie our acknowledgement of Gods providence and prudence, in receiving, as from God Reſpect to be ſhewed to Gods Miniſters as to God. that which by his miniſters is delivered unto us. Thus ſhall we teſtiſie ſuch reſpect to God, as will make him to give evidence of his good reſpect to us.
                  
                  
                     §. 10. Of the grounds that Miniſters now have to foretell judgements.
                     
                        Ob. MIniſters have not now ſuch certaine knowledge of Gods minde, as of old the Prophets and Apoſtles had, to whom God did immediatly and infallibly make knowne his minde.
                     
                        Anſw. We have a more ſure word, namely the holy Scriptures, 
                        2 Pet. 1. 19. 2 Tim. 3. 16. which are given by inspiration of God. Theſe ſhew what ſinnes do moſt offend God, and what doe ſooneſt pull downe vengeance from God, upon the committers of them. So as when Miniſters ſee ſuch ſinnes impudently and impenitently committed, they may well inferre that God purpoſeth to ſend ſome judgement to ſuch a people. To this purpoſe is it that the Apoſtle reckoneth up ſundry ſinnes that the Iſraelites committed in the wilderneſſe, and judgements that followed thereupon, that we ſhould not ſinne as 1 Cor. 10. 6. &amp;c they did, and fall after the ſame enſample of unbeliefe or Heb. 4. 11. diſobedience.
                     On this ground many Miniſters well noting the ſinnes of theſe times, did foretell that God would bring on this City, or a Plague, or ſome other judgement. And in the beginning of the yeare many did particularly foretell the Plague it ſelfe. Their threatning was little regarded; little or no amendment followed thereupon: now therefore is the Plague among us.
                     
                        A publique faſt was proclaimed to bec kept weekly every wedneſday while the Plague continued. Now that the Plague is begun, let us (my brethren) be admoniſhed to repent: and as a faſt is proclaimed, ſo let us keepe it after a right manner, 
                           〈…〉
                         humiliation of ſoule,

and contrition of ſpirit: renting our hearts, turning to the Lord: faſting from ſinne as well as from food. Prepare to meet thy God O England. This beginning of the Plague is a reall demonſtration of a greater Plague yet to come. If by more then ordinary humiliation and converſion Gods wrath be not pacified, this Plague is like to be greater then ever was before in our owne, or our fathers dayes; even ſuch an one as ſhall make this City empty: and make the eares of ſuch as heare of it to tingle againe. The Lion hath roared, who will not feare? The Lord God hath ſpoken, who can but

It is ſaid before (Verſe 42.) that the Congregation was gathered againſt Moſes and against Aaron. Hereupon it is likely that they were afraid, and with feare caſt downe (as we uſe to ſpeake) and in regard thereof the Lord thus ſaid to them, lift up your ſelves, or get you up.

                        from the middeſt, or from among that aſſembly. The word tranſlated 
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                         The word, that ſignifieth the place or time appointed for aſſembling together, is derived from the ſame roote. It here implieth a multitude that among themſelves appointed and conſpired to do what they did.
                     The particle 
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
                         THIS hath its Emphaſis. For it diſtinguiſheth this rebellious aſſembly from the reſt of the Iſraelites that did not conſpire with them.
                     The particle that joyneth the following clauſe to this, is a copulative, 
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
                         AND. It is thus word for word, Get you up from among this congregation, AND I will conſume them: ſo as it implieth that God would not deſtroy the multitude that ſinned, till they that ſinned not with them were ſeparated from them. Our Engliſh importeth as much by uſing a particle that intendeth the end of doing a thing, thus, THAT I may conſume them. Others expound it with a cauſall particle thus, FOR I will conſume them. All tends Genev. Engl. to the ſame.
                     The thing intended is ſet out by a

                         word that ſignifieth an utter deſtruction of them all. It is ſometimes uſed in the better part, and ſignifieth a full, abſolute, and perfect finiſhing of a thing: as where it is ſaid, Gen. 2. 3. 
                        God ended, or finiſhed, or perfected his worke. It is alſo uſed in the worſe part, applied to judgement, or deſtruction, and ſignifieth an utter,

                         finall deſtruction of all appointed to deſtruction: as where the Prophet ſaid to Ioaſh, 
                        2 King. 13. 19 
                        Thou hadst ſmitten Syria, till thou hadſt conſumed it. So it is here uſed. This is thus threatned becauſe by other judgements they had not bene bettered, but ſtill continued in their obſtinacy, as the former hiſtories in this chapter evidently ſhew.
                     To aggravate this intended judgement the more, it is added,

                        at once, or word for word to tranſlate it, as ſuddenly, or in a moment. Our Engliſh phraſe at once, implieth a quick, ſpeedy, ſudden doing of a thing; as where Abiſhai ſaid to David of Saul, let me ſmite him

                        at once: which is 1 Sam. 26. 8. as if he had more largely ſaid, I will not make much adoe, nor belong about the matter, I will not ſtrike many blowes, I will quickly with a blow diſpatch him. Some Engliſh

Tranſlators expound the word in the text, quickly.

                     The admonition intimates,

                           1. Gods mind: that he would not have them periſh.

                           1. The Author of the judgement.
                           2. The Kinde of the judgement.

                        The Kind of judgement ſetteth out

                              2. The Manner of doing it, at once.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                     The Connexion of the Reſolution with the Admonition (THAT I may, or AND I will) implieth Gods unwillingneſſe to plague the righteous with the unrighteous.
                     Seven principall Doctrines are here commended to our due conſideration.
                     
                        I. God is not willing that the righteous ſhould periſh with the unrighteous. For he giveth advice to ſuch as were righteous to eſcape, when he thinks of deſtroying the unrighteous.
                        II. They that would avoid the judgement that fals on the wicked, muſt avoid communion with them. The action here enjoyned (get you up) intends as much.
                        III. Multitudes conſpiring in evill muſt be left. The word congregation from which they muſt goe, implies thus much.
                        IIII. Mixture of the godly with the wicked is a ſtay of judgement. For by ſaying, Get yee up AND I will, or THAT I may conſume them, he intimates, that he

would not conſume the one till the other were gone.
                        V. The Lord revengeth the rebellious. For he it is that ſaith, I will conſume.
                        
                        VI. Stubborneneſſe after ſome ſtroaks cauſeth utter deſtruction. Sroake upon ſtroake had beene ſtroken before: for the earth had ſwallowed up ſome, and fire had devoured others, yet they perſiſted in their rebellion: therefore now ſaith God, I will conſume them.
                        
                        VII. Suddenneſſe adds much to the ſeverity of a judgement. For God intending ſeverity, threatneth to do what he intends at once.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 12. Of the godlies exemption from the ungodlies destruction.
                     I. See §. 11. 
                        GOD is not willing that the righteous periſh with the unrighteous. St. Peter gives three of the moſt famous inſtances that have bene hereof ſince the beginning of a 2 Pet. 2. 4, &amp;c. the world. One is of the Angels: (when they that fell were caſt into hell, the other were reſerved in heaven.) Another is of the old world: (when it was drowned, Noah and his family was preſerved in the arke.) A third is of Sodom and Gomorrah: (when they were deſtroyed with fire and brimſtone, Lot and his two daughters were kept alive.) Thence the Apoſtle inferres this concluſion, very pertinent to our purpose, 2 Pet. 2: 9. 
                        The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to reſerve the unjuſt unto the day of judgement to be puniſhed. 
                        Ezek. 9. 4, 6. The marke which God cauſed to be ſet on the forehead of ſuch as cried for all the abominations that were done, and this charge given thereupon, come not neare any man upon whom is the marke, ſhewes his mind to wards ſuch as keepe themſelves free from ſinnes which cauſe vengeance. So alſo ſuch exhortations as this, come out of her my people, that ye receive not of her plagues. 
                        Rev. 18. 4.
                     
                     Hereby God giveth evidence, that Pro. 15. 3. 
                        The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evill and the good: that he can diſtinguiſh betwixt ſuch as differ: that he can deale

with men, as they deale with him: that 
                           Pſal. 18. 26. 
                        with the pure he will ſhow himſelfe pure, and with the froward he will ſhew himſelfe froward: and that it is not in vaine to feare him, and to keepe our ſelves unſpotted from the world.
                  
                  
                     §. 13. Of the caſes wherein Saints have their ſhare in publique judgements.
                     
                        Ob. TRue, may ſome ſay, if this were univerſally and infallibly true, that no righteous man did at any time periſh with the unrighteous. But experience affoords evidence 
                           Servi Dei ſanct dupliciter mala temporalia patiuntur, quia &amp; ab ipſis impij

                              , &amp; cum ipſis patiununtur. Aug. Epiſt. 122. ad Victor. to the contrary. For in all publique judgements we ſee the righteous involved with the wicked. They may ſuffer temporall evils two wayes: by the wicked, and with the wicked.
                     
                        Anſw. If the extent of Gods deliverance be rightly conceived, it wilbe found to be univerſally and infallibly true, that God delivereth the righteous from the judgement of the wicked. It doth indeed oft fall out that righteous men have a ſhare in ſome externall judgements which the wicked pull upon themſelves, and that
                           1. When they make themſelves acceſſarie to thoſe common ſinnes that cauſe judgement. As Numb. 20. 12 Propeccatis ecrum Deus ſlagel lat etiam ipſes ſanctos ſuos. Aug. loc. citat. 
                              Moſes and Aaron became incredulous in the wilderneſſe as well as the other Iewes whoſe carkaſſes fell therein.
                           2. When the wiſe Lord knoweth that greater evils would befall them, if they ſhould then eſcape. Thus when the time was come that God had determined to heape judgement upon judgement till at length the land of Iudah ſhould be made deſolate, in the beginning of thoſe dayes was 2 King. 23. 29 
                              Ioſiah, that good King Ioſiah, ſlaine with the ſword of the enemie. Yet becauſe he lived not to ſee the miſeries of ſucceeding times, he is ſaid 2 King. 22. 20 to be gathered into his grave in peace.
                           
                           3. When the juſt God will ſhew the fierceneſſe of his wrath, how farre the wicked have provoked him, to aggravate the judgement, he taketh away the righteous therewith,

who are as chariots and horſmen while they remaine. Thus was good 1 Sam. 31. 2. 
                              Ionathan taken away: who if he had lived, might have beene a meanes of preſerving the houſe of Saul from utter ruine, though David had beene King. The death of righteous Ionathan much aggravated the ſinne of Saul, and the judgement that followed thereupon.
                           4. When the Lord to whom vengeance belongeth, will give the wicked an occaſion to expect ſure and ſore vengeance; then he maketh his Saints a ſigne and an example unto them. Thus 1 King. 13. 24. he cauſed a Lion to ſlay the man of God, that was ſeduced by a lying Prophet to tranſgreſſe the word of God. In this caſe ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 Pet. 4. 17. 
                              Iudgement muſt begin at the houſe of God. And if it firſt begin at us, what ſhalbe the end of them that obey not the Goſpell of God?
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 14. Of ſundry wayes of exempting Saints from judgements.
                     YET hath God his wayes and meanes to deliver the righteous in the forementioned caſes, and all other caſes whatſoever. As
                           1. By viſible preſervations of them from externall judgements: as Ier. 39. 17. 
                              Ebed melech was preſerved.
                           2. By Iſa. 57. 1. taking them from the evill to come: This was before exemplified in good Ioſiah.
                           
                           3. By ordering the judgement ſo, as it proves a meanes to them to honour God the more: and to do more good to ſuch as are better prepared to accept the good which they doe. Thus was Ezek. 1. 1. 
                              Ezekiel caried away to Babel in the firſt captivity, that he might propheſie in Babylon to the Iewes there, Icr. 24. 5. who were counted good figs in compariſon of the Iewes that were at Ieruſalem, who were as evill figs.
                           
                           4. By making the judgement a meanes of their peace, honour, and externall proſperity in this world. Thus the captivity of Dan. 2. 48, 49 
                              Daniel, and his three companions; and of Eſt. 2. 17.—6. 10. 
                              Eſther Mordecai and was a meanes of higher honour and greater advancement, then they could in all probable conjectures

have attained unto in their owneland. They were alſo thereby ſpeciall inſtruments of doing much good to the Church: and their names by that meanes are more honourable to this day in the Church of God.
                           5. By taking them by an externall judgement from earth

                              many ſleepe) the Apoſtle ſaith, —32. Sancti qui mala temporalia patiuntur, habent ſuas conſolationes, &amp; ſpem futuri ſeculi. Aug Epiſt 122. ad Victorian. 
                              when we are judged, we are chaſtened of the Lord, that we ſhould not be condemned with the world. Bleſſed be that ſword, though it be the ſword of a mortall enemie, that openeth a paſſage in the body for the ſoule to enter into heaven. And bleſſed be that ſickneſſe, though it be the Plague, that thruſteth the ſoule out of the bodies priſon, to celeſtiall glory and eternall life. So as in their ſufferings they have their comforts and hope of eternall life. Thus we ſee how judgements in the forementioned kinds prove bleſſings: and how the Saints that ſeeme to periſh in them may juſtly and truly ſay, We had periſhed, if we had not periſhed: even more juſtly then he

                     BE not afrighted, O ye righteous ones, be not afrighted over-much at the judgements, though they be terrible judgements, which fall out in the world. Though by reaſon of the multitudes of wicked ones among whom ye live in this world ye be every one forced to complaine and cry, Pſal 120. 5. 
                        Woe is me that I ſojourne in Meſech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar: and to wiſh and ſay, Jer. 9. 2. 
                        O that I had in the wilderneſſe a lodging place of way-fairing men, that I might leave my people: yet can the Lord ſingle you out, and when he comes to ſweepe them with the beſome of deſtruction, ſet

you aſide: and as a few precious jewels in the middeſt of a great heape of rubbiſh ſift them out, and preſerve them ſafe to himſelfe, when the rubbiſh is caſt away. It is ſaid of Chriſt, that He will thorowly purge his floure, and gather his wheate into his garner: but will burne up the chaffe with unquenchable 
                        Mat. 3. 12. 
                        fire. Men when they fan their corne cannot do it ſo thorowly cleane, but that ſome chaffe or tares wil remaine with the wheat, and ſome wheat be caſt out with the chaffe: witneſſe the offall that remaines after the beſt fanning that men can make. But Gods fanning, is a thorow fanning, not a 
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . graine, not a Saint ſhalbe overſlipt. This is indeed moſt properly meant of the laſt fanning of the world at the day of judgement: yet in the meane time doth the Lord take notice of every one of his, to provide for them, and in the moſt common and generall judgements to do that which in his wiſdome he ſeeth to be fitteſt for them. When Eliah 
                        1 King. 19. 18. thought he had bene left alone in Iſrael, God knew many more, yea he could tell the juſt number of them. Thou maiſt therefore, O faithfull one, ſay of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortreſſe, my God, in him will I truſt. Surely he

                     §. 16. Of beleevers dying of the Plague.
                     
                        Queſt. HOw is it then that the righteous as well as the unrighteous die of the Plague?
                     
                        Anſw. 2. Some ſay that no true believers are taken away with a common Plague. But this is too bold an aſſertion, unwarrantable, 
                           Putamuſne juſtos aliquos peſte occiſos? Quid obſtat? poluerunt &amp; ipſi involvi. Nonne &amp; multiſancti experti ſunt captivitatem. Mart. Comment. in 2 Sam. 24. Eccl. 9. 2. uncharitable. To adjudge all to hell that were taken away by that devouring peſtilence which in Davids time deſtroyed 70000 in three dayes, is an unmercifull doome. Experience giveth evidence that many that have manifeſted true outward fruits of a ſound faith, upright conſcience, honeſt heart, and entire repentance, have died of the Plague. Beſides the Word of God beareth witneſſe that All things come alike to all. There is one event to the righteous and the
                        
                        wicked. And how dieth the wiſeman? as the foole.
                     
                     2. Others ſay, that they that are true Saints, and have a —2. 16. true juſtifying faith may die of the Plague. But yet they adde, that there is a particular ſaith that Saints may have, which will in a common peſtilence keepe them ſafe from that diſeaſe. But I demand of ſuch, what warrant and ground they have for ſuch a faith. To pretend a faith without ground, is plaine preſumption. They produce for their ground the 91 Pſalme. But if they rightly marke the ſcope of that Pſalme, they ſhall find that freedome from the Plague is there no otherwiſe promiſed, then freedome from death in warre, then from hurt of wild beaſts if we be among them, then from other dangers and troubles, yea then honour, and long life. The promiſe then of preſerving believers from the See Domeſticall Duties on Eph. 6. 3. Treat. 1 §. 103. peſtilence is to be taken as other promiſes of temporall bleſſings: ſo farre forth as God in his wiſdome ſeeth it good for them to be delivered. And what believer would be delivered

                        David could have bene content to have died of this diſeaſe if it had ſo ſeemed good to the divine wiſdome. For what skilleth it whether ſword or ſickneſſe, Pluriſie or Plague looſe the ſoule from the body. God eſpecially obſerves in what diſpoſition, not by what meanes his ſervants depart out of this world to him.
                     3. Without queſtion therefore true believers may die of the Plague, and many have in common infections been taken away thereby: yet in mercy, as was §. 13. Gen. 40. 20, 21, 22. before ſhewed. And as there was a great difference betwixt taking Pharaohs chiefe butler and chiefe Baker out of priſon, the head of them both was lifted up: but of one to his high office, of the other to the gallowes: ſo can God make a greater difference betwixt the godly and ungodly, even when he takes them both out of the priſon of this body by one and the ſame diſeaſe, ſuppoſe the Plague. He can hereby advance one to heaven, and thruſt downe the other to hell: as he dealt with the two theeves that hung on the croſſe with Chriſt.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 17. Of avoiding communion with the wicked, for avoiding their judgement.
                     II. See §. 11. 
                        THey that would avoid the judgement that fals on the wicked muſt avoid communion with them. For this end did Gen. 6. 13. God cauſe an arke to be made for Noah and his family to go into from the old world, that ſo they might be preſerved from the generall deluge: and —19. 12, 14. ſent his Angels to bring Lot, and ſuch as belonged to him out of Sodom. To this purpoſe the people of God were adviſed to Ier. 50. 8. 
                        remoue out of the midſt of Babylon, and —51. 6. 
                        to deliver every man his ſoule: which advice is alſo given, in regard of ſpirituall Babylon, 
                        Rev. 18. 4. 
                        to come out of her: and that on this ground, that they receive not her plagues.
                     
                     Saints by ſeparating themſelves from the wicked in time of judgement, ſhew their care to uſe what meanes they can for preventing miſchiefe: which is a point of wiſdome commended by the Holy Ghoſt, who giveth this note of a wiſe man, Pro. 22. 3. 
                        A prudent man foreſeeth the evill, and hideth himſelfe: but the ſimple paſſe on and are puniſhed. This care of uſing meanes for ſafety, and in the uſe of meanes to depend on God for his bleſſing, is well pleaſing to God. Act. 27. 22, 24 31. God had promiſed that none in the ſhip with Paul ſhould be loſt, yet when ſome of the ſhip-men were about to leave the ſhip, Paul ſaid, Except theſe men abide in the ſhip ye cannot be ſaved. All lawfull and warrantable means are the viſible hand of Gods inviſible providence. To reject or neglect meanes is to refuſe to take God by the hand when he reacheth it out unto us, and to follow his viſible direction.
                     It is therefore fooliſh preſumption, rather then a prudent reſolution, either to accompany thoſe that are as it were in the fire of Gods judgement, or not to go from them, when a faire and warrantable opportunity is offered. Gen. 19. 14. This is taxed as a point of folly in Lots ſonnes in law. Iehoſaphat too much failed herein. He heard the Prophet ſay that 1 King 22. 20, 32. 
                        Ahab ſhould fall at Ramoth-Gilead, and yet he would accompanie

him thither. It had almoſt coſt him his life.
                  
                  
                     §. 18. Of flying in time of Plague.
                     
                        Queſt. IS it then lawfull to depart from our owne place and habitation in time of Plague?
                     
                        Anſ. Difference is to be made in this caſe betwixt perſons Who may fly. that are free, and not by any ſpeciall bond of relation tied to others, and ſuch as are ſo bound. As for the former ſort, ſuch as are free, I ſee no juſt reaſon why liberty of eſcaping ſhould be denied to them.
                     1. The departure of ſome may be a meanes in an infectious aire to keepe the infection from violence. Much fuell where fire is kindled increaſeth the fervour and violence of the fire. Multitudes of people to an infected place, are as fuell to the fire of peſtilence.
                     2. Such by eſcaping provide for their owne ſafety, without prejudice to others. For what prejudice can it be that ſuch as are not by any particular bond tied to them that tarry, leave them?
                     3. The departure of ſome may make much to the benefit and advantage of ſuch as tarry. For they have the better opportunity of ſending ſuccour to them. This was one reaſon why the people would not have David go into the field, that he might 2 Sam. 18. 3. 
                        ſuccour them out of the City.
                     
                     4. Mat. 10. 23. It is permitted to ſuch in time of perſecution to fly: yea and Mat. 24. 16. Fugit populus Hebraeorum, ut fides ejus &amp; vita inter fluctus, ſibi apperiret vi am. Ambr. de fug ſeculi. in time of warre: why not then in time of Plague?
                     
                        Ob. 1. The Plague is an immediate ſtroke of God; wherby ſuch as he hath appointed to death are ſtricken. It is not infectious.
                     
                        Anſ. I grant it to be an extraordinary diſeaſe, but not immediate. The kind of diſeaſe, and the effects thereof on mans body, do ſhew that its no more immediate then many other diſeaſes. If becauſe ſuch as are appointed to death are ſtrucken with it, meanes of eſcaping it might not be uſed: no meanes for avoiding any judgement might be uſed. For the infection of it, let experience determine that caſe.
                     
                     
                        Ob. 2. It is a fruit of faithleſneſſe to ſhun the Plague.
                     
                        Anſw. No more then to ſhun other dangers: Men may indeed upon diſtruſt fly: but that ſhewes the frailty of the perſon, not the unlawfulneſſe of the action.
                     
                        Ob. 3. If ſome fly, all may fly. So the ſicke be left without ſuccour.
                     
                        Anſw. 1. Some are more bound to venture the hazard then others. As Magiſtrates for keeping good order: Miniſters for feeding the ſoule. Neare of kindred for looking to their bodies. Such as are under command, as children and ſervants.
                     2. Others are not ſo ſubject to infection: as aged.
                     3. Others are not of ſuch uſe, but may better be ſpared: as the poorer and meaner ſort. The people would ſay to David, thou art worth 10000 of us.

                        MVltitudes conſpiring in evill must be left. It was the commendation of thoſe 7000 in Iſrael 
                        1 King. 19 18 of whom God tooke eſpeciall notice, that though all —10. 
                        Iſrael worſhipped Baal, yet they bowed not a knee to that idoll: yea though Eliah thought himſelfe to beleft alone, yet would not he aſſociate himſelfe with the multitudes of Apoſtates. Ioh. 6, 66. &amp;c, 
                        Many of Chriſts Diſciples went backe and walked no more with him. Whereupon Chriſt ſaid to the twelve, will ye alſo go away? But Peter in the name of the reſt anſwered, Lord, to whom ſhall we goe? Thou haſt the words of eternall life. A worthy reſolution. A like reſolution was this. Mat. 26. 33. 
                        Though all men ſhall be offended becauſe of thee, yet will I never be offended. O if he had ſtood to this! Very pertinent to this point is this prohibition of the Law, Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to do evill.
                     
                     The number of men ſinning neither extenuateth the ſinne, nor exempteth from judgement: but rather aggravateth the ſinne, and pulleth downe more ſevere and ſpeedy vengeance. Multitudes of ſinners are as multitudes of faggots, or

other combuſtible fuell, which are ſo much the ſooner ſet on fire: and being once ſet on fire do burne ſo much the more fiercely. The Prophets render this to be the cauſe of the fierce wrath of the Lord powred upon the Iewes, that They all tranſgreſſed: 
                        Ier. 2. 29. 
                        From the leaſt of them even to the greatest of them, from the Prophet even to the Priest every one dealeth falſely: 
                        —6. 13.—28. 
                        They are all grievous revolters: 
                        —8. 6. 
                        No man repenteth of his wickedneſſe.
                     
                     Be ſo farre therefore from taking boldneſſe from multitudes of men conſpiring in ſinne, as on that ground to be the more fearefull leſt ſome ſudden judgement ſhould fall upon them. Then eſpecially is the time for ſuch as are upright to mourne, with faſting and prayer to humble their ſoules before God, and to keep themſelves unſpotted, when they ſee all of all ſorts with greedineſſe and impudency running into ſinne. Many are too prone indeed to make that the ground of their actions, which Huſhai in ſtate-policy onely pretended, when he ſaid, 2 Sam. 16. 18. 
                        Whom all the men of Iſrael chuſe, his will Ibe.

                              ijs, &amp;c. The way wherein multitudes run, is the broad way that leadeth to deſtruction. But ſtrait is the gate, and narrow the way that leadeth to life: and few there be that find it. And if there be few that find, ſurely there are fewer that attaine to the end of that way. For ſome faile in the beginning. others in the middeſt, moſt when they come almoſt to end. Whereupon our Lord ſaith, that many are called, but few choſen.

                        MIxture of the godly with the wicked is a ſtay of judgement. When God was about to deſtroy Gen. 19. 22. 
                        Sodom, he ſaith to Lot, Haste thee: I can do nothing till thou be gone.

                        Gen. 18. 32. Had there beene but ten righteous men

in Sodom, ſurely it had not bin then deſtroyed when it was. Gods reſpect to his Saints.
                     
                     
                        Abraham intimates the reaſon hereof in this Rhetoricall communication with God, Wilt thou alſo deſtroy therighteous with the wicked? That be farre from thee. Shall not the Iudge 
                        Gen. 18. 24, 35. 
                        of all the world do right? The ſupreme Lord of all hath ſuch reſpect to his faithfull ones, as he will rather ſpare many wicked ones for a few righteous ones, then deſtroy a few righteous ones with many wicked ones.
                     Behold here a meanes of Gods patience and long ſuffering 
                           Cum merita noſtra nos gravant ne diligamur a Deo, relevori apud eum illo, um meritis poſſmus quos Deus diligit. Aug Queſt ſu per Exod. l. 2, c. 49. in the world: which is that mixture of holy ones with the wicked that are in the world. Were the number of Gods Elect accompliſhed, and ſuch as are ſanctified taken out of the world, ſoone would there be an end of all. Many Nations, Cities, Townes, and other Societies are ſpared, for ſome faithfull Saints therein. This ſurely is the reaſon of Gods much forbearance towards this Land, this City of London, and other places in this kingdome. There is a remnant of righteous perſons. Theſe hold up their hands to God ordinarily and extraordinarily: to their perſons, to their praiers hath the Lord ſuch reſpect, as they do in a maner hold Exo 32. 10. him, as Moſes held God when it was in his mind utterly to deſtroy all the children of Iſrael that came out of Egypt. Act. 27. 24. God gave to Paul all them that failed with him. It is ſaid that a little before Heidelberg in the Vpper-Palatinate was taken, their faithfull Miniſters were all taken away. The world enjoy all they have by Saints.
                     
                     O the ungratefulneſſe of the wicked in the world! Thorow Gods favour to the Saints here and there diſperſed in the world, they that live and enjoy any comforts in the world are beholding to thoſe Saints, for their peace, plenty, ſafety, honours, wealth, liberty, livings, and life it ſelfe. Yet in the world who more hated, ſcorned, reproched, evilly entreated and perſecuted in the world. Is not this more then monſtrous ingratitude?
                     But how beholding to God are theſe Saints, to whom the Lord (who is beholding to none) beareth ſuch reſpect, as not onely to ſpare them, but, for their ſakes, thoſe among whom they live?

                        Rom. 13. 4. 
                        I will performe (ſaith the Lord) againſt Elie, all things which I have ſpoken concerning his houſe. Where men are inſtruments of puniſhing ſuch, the Lord is the principall Author. They are Gods Rom. 13. 4. 
                        Miniſters, or rather Gods Iſa. 10. 5. 
                        rod, ſtaffe, and —34 6. 
                        ſword to ſmite his people withall.
                     The Lord takes upon him to revenge, that he may order vengeance as he ſeeth juſt cauſe: either to aggravate or mitigate Lege Tertullianum. lib. 1. cont. Marcion Qui dixit Deum non ulciſci malos.
                         it: to continue or to ceaſe puniſhing: which queſtionleſſe was the reaſon that moved David to ſay, 2 Sam. 24. 14. 
                        Let us fall now into the hand of the Lord.
                     
                     As all hope of impunity is hereby taken away, ſo good ground of penitency is given. How can any thinke to eſcape ſeeing the every-where preſent, all-ſeeing, impartiall God undertaketh to puniſh him. Heb. 10. 30. 
                        Vengeance belongeth unto me, ſaith the Lord: where upon he inferreth, I will recompence. Feare therefore to provoke this avenger. Do not vainely hope to eſcape his revenge though thou perſiſt in ſinne.
                     Yet if after thou haſt ſinned thy heart ſmite thee, and thereupon true repentance be wrought in thee, prepare to meet thy God. Thus maiſt thou either prevent and keepe off all vengeance, as Ion. 3. 10. the Ninevites did. Or if he have begun to ſtrike, thou maiſt make him 2 Sam 24. 16, 17. 
                        repent of the evill, and cauſe him to ſtay his hand, as David did. It is God that ſmiteth. To him therefore muſt we looke. It was the aggravation

of Iſraels obſtinacy, that Iſa. 9. 13. 
                        They turned not to him that ſmote them.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 22. Of the utter deſtruction which ſtubborneneſſe brings to men.
                     VI. See §. 11. 
                        STubborneneſſe after ſome ſtroakes cauſeth utter deſtruction. 
                        Lev. 26, 18, &amp;c. So much is threatned in the Law: and Iſa. 1. 5 &amp;c.—9. 13, 14. Am. 4 6, &amp;c by the Prophets declared to be accompliſhed. Many particular remarkable inſtances hereof are recorded in Scripture, Deu. 29 19, &amp;c that ſucceeding ages might be the better warned thereby. Gen. 14. 10, 11 
                        Sodom and the Cities that tooke part with her, were overcome and ſacked by the foure Kings that came againſt them. This was no light ſtroake: yet it wrought no amendment. Wherfore not long after Gen. 19. 24. they were utterly deſtroyed with fire and brimſtone from heaven. Pharaoh and his ſubjects were ſo ſmitten with Exo. 7. 20. &amp;c ten ſeverall plagues, as gave ſufficient demonſtration of their folly in ſtanding out againſt the great Lord of heaven: yet ſtill continued they to harden their hearts againſt God: therefore at length Exo. 14. 28. he and his whole hoſt was drowned in the Red Sea. The Iſraelites were oft and ſorely puniſhed by many judgements, but no whit bettered by any of them: ſo as the Lord was provoked at length to make their land deſolate. Lam. 1. 1, &amp;c This Mat. 3. 10. phraſe which Iohn the Baptiſt uſeth (The axe is put to the root of the tree) importeth as much. By the axe he meaneth Gods judgement: by the tree the nation of the Iewes: by putting to the root, an utter extirpation. A tree may be lopt, and yet ſtand, and grow and flouriſh againe. But if it be cut at the root, downe falls body, boughs and all. He implies therfore, that whereas God had formerly by Plague, famine, ſword, captivity, and other like judgements lopt them, and oft times made them bare, now he intends to cut their root, utterly to cut them downe, and caſt them off.
                     Gods juſtice and wiſdome, yea and the glory of all his See the Churches Conqueſt on Exo. 17. 14. § 69. properties provoke him ſo to do. If the ſtubborneneſſe of ſinners againſt lighter judgements might carry it away, man

would ſeeme ſtronger then God, Gods wiſdome and juſtice would be much impeached: His corrections would be deſpiſed: his Word not regarded. Beſides others would be emboldened by the ſtubborneneſſe of ſome to carrie themſelves ſtoutly againſt God. Mortall Kings, and other Governours, Parents and Maſters will not ſuffer their inferiours to carrie away the maſterie by ſtoutneſſe. Can we then imagine that the immortall God will ſuffer it. He can and will beat downe the ſtubborneneſſe of the ſtouteſt.
                     
                        Humble your ſelves (brethren) under the mighty hand of 
                        1 Pet. 5. 6. 
                        God. If he threaten, fall downe before him, repent, go not on to provoke him further. If we go on to provoke him more and more, his rod will be turned to a ſtaffe; his ſtaffe to a ſword, cleane to cut us off.
                  
                  
                     §. 23. Of ſudden judgements.
                     VII. See §. 11. 
                        SVddenneſſe adds much to the ſeverity of a judgement. In way of terrour ſuddenneſſe is oft threatned, as where the Lord ſaith, Exo. 33. 5. 
                        I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and conſume thee. 
                        Pſal. 73. 19. 
                        How are they brought into deſolation as in a moment? 
                        Pro. 1 27. 
                        Their deſtruction commeth as a whirle-wind. 
                        Deut. 7. 4. 
                        The anger of the Lord wil destroy thee ſuddenly. 
                        Pro. 6. 15. 
                        His calamity ſhall come ſuddenly: ſuddenly ſhall he be broken without remedy. 
                        Iſa, 29. 5.z—30. 13.—47. 11. 
                        It ſhalbe at an inſtant, ſuddenly. 
                        Ier. 6. 26. 
                        The ſpoiler ſhall ſuddenly come. The terrour of Babylons deſtruction is hereby aggravated, in that it was —51. 8. 
                        ſuddenly fallen: yea and of Sodom, which is thus expreſſed, Lam. 4. 6. 
                        The puniſhment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater then the puniſhment of the ſinne of Sodom that was overthrowne as in a moment. It is noted that Gen. 19. 23. 
                        the Sun was riſen upon the earth a little before the fire and brimſtone fell from heaven. That riſing of the Sun made ſhew, and gave hope of a faire day. Yet then, even on a ſudden was that faire skie turned into a ſulphurious and moſt diſmall skie. 
                     
                        
                           Miſchiefes of ſudden judgements.1. Sudden judgements ſtrike men into amazement. So ſaith Eliphaz, 
                           Iob. 22. 10. 
                           Sudden feare troubleth thee. It makes men at
                           
                           their wits end, as we ſpeake. Inſtance a ſudden and unexpected ſurpriſall by an enemy.
                        2. Sudden evils not onely confound a mans wit and underſtanding, but they bereave him of the uſe of ſuch meanes as are uſefull for his ſuccour. For there muſt be time for providing ſufficient meanes.
                        3. They are a great hinderance to true repentance, to faithfull prayer, and ſuch like ſpirituall meanes, whereby the wrath of God might be pacified, and judgements prevented, or removed.
                        4. They are evidences of Gods incenſed and implacable wrath. As a man that is fully reſolved to puniſh, and not to ſpare, will ſuddenly do what he intends to do.
                     
                     This affords matter of inſtruction and direction.
                     
                        Inſtruction in Gods tender reſpect to us: For though by our ſinnes we have long and much provoked him ſuddenly and utterly to deſtroy us, yet hath he given us many warnings before hand by his Miniſters: and Ian. 13. 1624 only one died. Feb. 3 three. Feb. 10. five. Feb. 17. three, Feb. 24. one, Mar. 17. two. Mar. 24. eight. 1625 Mar. 31 ſix. Apr 7. eight. Apr. 14. eighteene. Apr. 31. eighteene. And after that it increaſed every weeke more and more till Aug 18. when there died in one weeke 4463 of the Plague. And of all diſeaſes 5205 in London and in the nine out pariſhes. Luk. 21. 34. begun this judgement of the Plague by degrees, that ſo like wiſe-men we might fore-ſee the uttermoſt perill, and anſwerably prepare our ſelves.
                     
                        Direction, to be ſo watchfull over our ſelves, ſo well furniſhed and prepared, by that ſpirituall furniture which in the Word is preſcribed unto us, that no evill may ſuddenly ſurprize us, nor ordinary nor extraordinary evils, not death it ſelfe, nor the laſt judgement. Take heed (ſaith the Iudge himſelfe) to your ſelves, leſt at any time your hearts be overchanged, and ſo that day come upon you unawares.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 24. Of the expoſition and obſervations of the laſt part of the 45. Verſe.
                     
                        
                           NVMB. 16. 45.And they fell upon their faces.
                     
                     A Remedy for the fore-mentioned calamity is here ſet out in the practice of Moſes and Aaron. For this Relative THEY hath reference to them two eſpecially. For these rebels Verſ. 41, 42, 43, 46, 47. 
                        murmured, and gathered themſelves againſt theſe two: and they two are ſaid to come before the Tabernacle: and after this theſe two take order for cure of this Plague. See more of theſe in the Churches Conqueſt on Exo. 17. 9, 10. 
                        Moſes was the ſupreme Governour and Prince over this people. Aaron was their chiefe Prieſt.
                     By falling upon their faces, is meant their humble and hearty prayer to God for this people. Metonymia Adjuncti, vel Signi. The outward geſture whereby their inward intention was ſet out is put for prayer. It is in effect all one as if he had ſaid, They prayed. But yet this Tropicall ſpeech is not without its emphaſis. For it implieth,
                           1. A reverend reſpect to the Divine Majeſty. For of old when men would teſtifie reverence to excellent perſons, at ſight of them they fell on their face, as Ruth 2. 10. 
                              Ruth before Booz, 
                              1 Sam 25. 23. 
                              Abigail before Dauid. Thus did Gen. 17. 3. 17 
                              Abraham teſtifie his reverence to the All-ſufficient God.
                           
                           2. An holy aſtoniſhment at, and admiration of ſurpaſſing excellency and glory. In which reſpect Ezek. 1. 29. 
                              Ezekiel fell on his face.
                           
                           3. A feare, which at the apprehenſion of Gods terror, and our wretchedneſſe perplexeth the ſoule. So Dan. 8. 17. 
                              Daniel was afraid, and fell on his face. 
                              Luke 5. 8.
                           
                           4. An humble mind in regard of ones ſelfe. This 1 Sam. 20. 41. 
                              David manifeſted when he fell on the ground before Ionathan. And 1 Cor. 14. 25. they that are effectually wrought upon by the Word, and have the ſecrets of their heart made manifeſt, in humility falling downe on their faces worſhip God.
                           
                           
                              
5. Shame and confuſion of face for great provocations of Gods wrath. 1 Chr. 21. 16. This moved David, when he ſaw the fierceneſſe of Gods wrath for his great ſinne, to fall downe on his face before the Lord.
                           6. Earneſt and ardent deſire of obtaining what we pray for. In this reſpect Ioſ. 7. 6. 
                              Ioſhua and all the Elders of Iſrael fell to the earth upon their faces, before the Arke of the Lord.
                           
                           7. An agony whereinto one is caſt thorow ſome inward trouble of ſoule, or ſome outward fearefull ſight. In the former reſpect Mat. 26. 38, 39. 
                              Chriſt fell on his face and prayed. In the latter reſpect Dan 10. 9. 
                              Daniel lay on his face as in a dead ſleepe.
                           
                        
                     
                     Moſt of theſe may be applied to Moſes and Aarons falling on their faces here in this text. For Verſ. 42. 
                        The glory of the Lord appeared: and the wrath of the Lord was manifeſted: and the people had committed a great ſinne; and a Plague was already begun, therefore without all queſtion, in reverence to the Divine Majeſty, in admiration of his glory, in ſome feare, yet in an humble ſubmiſſion to God, in ſhame of the peoples in gratitude, and in earneſt deſire of pardon for their ſinne, and removall of the judgement, they fell upon their faces. So as this geſture implieth an extraordinary manner of prayer.
                     Sixe Obſeruations hence ariſe: whereof three concerne the action performed, and three the Perſons that performed it.
                     
                        I. See The Saints Sacrifice on Pſal. 116. 4. 
                           Prayer is a ready remedy for a deſperate calamity. Such a calamity was the peoples here. And this remedy is here with approbation uſed.
                        II. See The whole armour of God, on Eph. 6. 18. §. 95, &amp;c. 
                           In extraordinary need extraordinary prayer muſt be uſed. The ſinne of the people and the threatning of God ſhewes the extraordinary need. Their geſture in falling on their faces, argues their extraordinary prayer.
                        III. See The Churches Conqueſt on Exo. 17. 11. §. 29. 
                           Inward devotion of the ſoule must be manifeſted by an anſwerable outward dispoſition of body: Such a diſpoſition was this falling on their faces.
                        IIII. See the whole armour of God, on Eph. 6. 18. §. 36, &amp;c. 
                           Prayer is to be made for others in their neceſſities.
                           
God bids theſe that fell on their faces get them away, that they might be ſafe, yet they for them that were in danger, fell on their faces.
                        
                        V. Ibid §. 51. 
                           Prayer is to be made for ſuch as wrong us. This people for whom the prayer is here powred out, murmured, and gathered themſelves together against Moſes and Aaron, who here in their behalfe fell on their faces.
                        
                        VI. Magistrates and Ministers are eſpecially to pray 
                           See the Churches Conqueſt on Exo. 17. 12 §. 40. 
                           for averting publique judgements. Such were they who here fell on their faces. Moſes was a Prince, Aaron a Prieſt.
                        
                     
                     Theſe Obſervations are all of them worthy our due obſervation: but I have handled them elſewhere, as the places quoted in the margent, ſhew.

                     TO the fore-mentioned remedy of prayer, here is another added: whereby their prayer was made the more effectuall. This is firſt preſcribed in this text: and then performed in the next verſe.
                     
                        Moſes he preſcribes: and that on juſt grounds. For,
                           1. Moſes had a more immediate inſpiration, and more extraordinary revelations then Aaron, or any other at that time. With him (ſaith the Lord) will I ſpeake mouth to 
                              Num. 12. 8. 
                              mouth, even apparantly, and not in darke ſpeeches, &amp;c.
                           2. Moſes was the ſupreme head, and chiefe governour on earth at that time of that people. Act. 7. 35. 
                              God ſent him to be a Ruler. 
                              Num. 12. 11. 
                              Aaron himſelfe cals him, his Lord.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        Moſes preſcribes to Aaron, becauſe
                           1. Exo. 4. 15. 
                              Aaron was to be Moſes his ſpokeſman to the people.
                              
                              Aaron was to be to Moſes inſtead of a mouth: and Moſes was to be to Aaron inſtead of God.

                              Aaron was then made the High-Prieſt: ſo as —30. 7. to uſe a cenſer, to take fire from off the altar, to put incenſe on the cenſer, to make an attonement, belonged to Aaron by vertue of his Prieſt hood.
                        
                     
                     The particulars here enjoyned were holy rites ordained by God under the Law for pacifying his wrath.
                     The Cenſer was an inſtrument made of a laſting mettall A cenſer.

                         that would not eaſily melt, as of gold, or braſſe, fit to hold fire in it, with a ſteele or handle to hold it by. The uſe of it was to hold live, burning coales on it, that incenſe being caſt thereon, by the heate of the fire it might ſend out a ſmoake of a ſweet ſmell, which the Prieſt carying from place to place, cauſed the ſweet ſavour of incenſe to diſperſe it ſelfe, and to be ſmelt whereſoever he came. Some of theſe cenſers were of braſſe, for the ordinary Prieſts to carry incenſe up and downe the Tabernacle, and Temple: with Num. 16. 39. ſuch as theſe the 250 men that conſpired with Korah, and were deſtroyed with fire, offered incenſe. Others were of gold, as 1 King. 7. 50. thoſe which Salomon made for the Temple: eſpecially that which was made for the High-Prieſt to carrie incenſe on it into the moſt holy place, whereof Heb 9. 4. the Apoſtle to the Hebrewes makes mention.
                     The fire of the altar here mentioned was of that fire which firſt fell from heaven (Lev. 9. 24.) and was commanded to be kept continually burning on the altar (Lev. 6. 13.) never to go out: with it they burnt all their offerings that were to be burnt: of it they tooke to carrie incenſe up and downe: all other fire was counted ſtrange fire (Lev. 10. 1.) They 
                           Duo erant altaria: unum thymia matis, aurcum intrinſecus: &amp; alterum ante templum aeneum holocauſtorum. Hier. Comment. l. 3. in Ezek 9. who uſed other fire in holy rites, incenſed the fire of Gods wrath againſt them. (Lev. 10. 2.)
                     Concerning the altar, there were in the Tabernacle two altars. One for all manner of oblations. The other onely for incenſe, (Exo. 30. 9.) That a large one: This a ſmall one. That covered with braſſe: This with gold. That was ſet in the Tabernacle neare to the outer court, where when the

curtens were drawne, all the people might ſee it: this neare to the moſt holy place, (Exo. 40. 5, 6.) and therefore ſaid to be before the Lord, (Num. 16. 12.)
                     On the great brazen altar the holy fire ſent from the Lord, burnt continually. When fire was to be laid on the golden altar for incenſe it was fetcht from this. It is probable that at this time Aaron tooke fire from that altar where it burnt continually.

This among the foure is the onely common ſpice: the other are ſuch as we read not of in any other place: ſo as it is no eaſie matter to tell what kind of ſpices they were. Sure it is that Exo. 30. 38. no perfume might be made like that incenſe which was made of them.
                     This is ſtiled Exo. 25. 6. 
                        ſweet incenſe, and that fitly, in a double reſpect.
                           1. Of the naturall ſavour. It was exceeding ſweet.
                           2. Of the legall effect, which was to cauſe a ſweet ſavour in Gods noſtrils. Lev. 16. 13. The Prieſt therefore in the ſmoke and ſmell of it died not.
                        
                     
                     Here we ſee that the Incenſe was a proper peculiar perfume reſerved only for holy uſes. The fire alſo was holy, ſuch as firſt came from the Lord, and was preſerved for his ſervices. The altar was likewiſe for ſacred uſes, and finally, the cenſer. All were ordained of God, and in that reſpect all of them warrantable. They were, as other legall types, externall, but yet they had their Evangelicall truths: whereof § 36, 37. hereafter.
                     
                        
Theſe things being thus prepared, Moſes chargeth Aaron to go to the Congregation, namely that aſſembly of rebels that was gathered together againſt Gods ſervants; whereof § 11. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                         before. And that which Aaron doth, he muſt do with all ſpeed, becauſe the fire of Gods jealouſie was already kindled.
                     The end of all that which was given in charge, and the effect that would follow thereupon, is thus expreſſed, And make an attonement for them.
                     
                     The copulative particle 
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . AND, whereby the diſtinct branches of Moſes his charge are joyned together, importeth the latter branch to be inferred as an end of the former: as if he had ſaid, offer incenſe, that thereby an attonement may be made. So this particle is tranſlated Verſe 45. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
                         before, where it is ſaid, Get you up, THAT I may conſume them. Yea, it doth alſo imply a conſequence, and an effect that would follow thereupon: as if he had ſaid, Offer incenſe, and ſo thereby thou ſhalt make an attonement for them. The iſſue verifieth thus much. For Aaron having done what Moſes gave him in charge, its ſaid Verse 46. 
                        He made an attonement for them.

                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
                         
                        Make an attonement, is the interpretation of one ſhort Hebrew word, which (if our Engliſh would beare it) might thus be tranſlated, attone.
                     
                     The Hebrew word properly ſignifieth to cover. 
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                            
                           oper culum.
                         
                        The cover which was laid upon the arke, is ſet out by a word derived from this; Metaphorically it is applied to ſinne, and to wrath incenſed by ſinne, and ſignifieth to cover them: that is to pardon ſinne, and to pacifie wrath. As where it ſaid, Pſal. 78. 38. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
                         
                        He forgave iniquity: word for word, He covered iniquity. And where in relation to the wrath of a King, it is ſaid, Pro. 16. 14. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
                         
                        A wiſe man will cover it, that is, pacifie it. It is alſo ſimply uſed, and ſignifieth to be propitious, favourable, or mercifull: as where prayer is thus made to God, Deut 21 8. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                        Be mercifull to thy people Iſrael. It is frequently uſed, to expiate; that is to purge away, or take away any uncleanneſſe, ſo as it may not be imputed: and to make it fit for holy uſes, or to appeare before God. Thus it is applied to things uſed under

the Law, and to perſons: as to Lev. 16 33. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                         the holy Sanctuary, to the Tabernacle of the congregation, to the Altar, to the Priests, and to all the People of the congregation. All the fore-mentioned acceptions of the word do adde much to the clearing of this phraſe in this place, make an attonement. Attonement 
                        What attonement is. (according to the Engliſh notation of the word) implieth two at one: namely two that were at odds or variance. Such attonement is as much as agreement, or reconciliation. This in regard of that odds which is betwixt God and man is done two wayes. 1. By taking away ſinne, the cauſe of How attonement is made. wrath. 2. By pacifying wrath, the effect of ſinne. Offerings for ſinne typified the former. Incenſe, the latter. Though theſe may thus be diſtinguiſhed, yet can they not be ſevered. For without ſinne be taken away, wrath will not be pacified. And if wrath ſhould be pacified, where's the benefit thereof, if ſinne be not taken away. Though therefore the one may be more expreſly ſpecified, yet the other alſo is there intended. Now becauſe of the mention of incenſe here, by attonement here meant, the pacifying of Gods wrath is moſt directly ſet out.
                     This Relative particle THEM (

                        for them) hath reference to the fore-named congregation: a congregation of rebels. Yet is order taken for pacifying Gods wrath juſtly incenſed againſt them.
                     The Summe of this text is a Preſcript for pacifying Gods wrath.

                     In the latter you may againe obſerve,
                           1. The Duty to be done. Make an attonement.
                           
                           2. The Perſons for whom▪ 
                              For them: namely for the Congregation before mentioned.
                        
                     
                     Six eſpeciall points are here to be noted.
                     
                        I. Men muſt do what they do by vertue of their calling. It belonged to Moſes as a Prince and a Prophet to give direction for ſtaying the Plague: and to Aaron as High-Prieſt it belonged to offer incenſe. Moſes therefore did that which belonged to a Prince and Prophet. And he appointed Aaron to do that which belonged to Deut. 33. 10. an High-Prieſt.
                        
                        II. Such meanes muſt be uſed to pacifie Gods wrath as by Gods Word are warranted. Offring up Incenſe, which is the meanes here to be uſed, was expreſly warranted by the Word of God, Lev. 16. 12, 13.
                        III. Things warrantable in their ſubstance muſt be performed with warrantable circumstances. For this end the foreſaid Incenſe was to be offered on a Cenſer, and to be burnt with fire from off the altar, Lev. 16. 12.
                        IIII. Duties of mercy muſt be performed to ſuch as wrong us. This congregation murmured, and gathered themſelves together againſt Moſes and Aaron. Yet Moſes bids Aaron go to them, to do a worke of mercy for them in this their need.
                        V. Gods wrath is with all expedition to be pacified. For this end Aaron is charged to go quickly, that with all poſſible ſpeed he might make an attonement.
                        VI. There are meanes of reconciliation betwixt God and
                           
                           man after Gods wrath is incenſed. The attonement here enjoyned giveth proofe thereof: eſpecially if we weigh the perſons for whom it was to be made. For them, even them that had provoked the Lord at once to conſume them.
                     
                     Theſe inſtructions ariſe from the letter of the hiſtory. There is an higher myſtery contained therein, whereof § 36, 37, &amp;c. afterwards.

                     As we deſire to be accepted of God, to receive comfort to our ſoules by the things we do, and thereby to do good to others, let us be well informed in the duties that by vertue of our owne proper function belong unto us, and therein be faithfull and diligent. Much paines may be taken, and diligence uſed in other mens matters, and little thanks gotten for all that paines and diligence. Yea we may bring by ſuch paines and diligence much trouble to our ſelves, and yet no comfort in all that trouble. Wherefore 1 Pet. 4. 15. St. Peter exhorteth Chriſtians from ſuffering as buſie-bodies in other mens matters. And it is remarkable, that he reckoneth their ſufferings among the ſufferings of malefactors. 1 Theſ. 4. 11.

                     §. 27. Of uſing warrantable meanes to pacifie Gods wrath.
                     II. See §. 25. 
                        SVch means muſt be uſed to pacifie Gods wrath as by Gods Word are warranted. Of old before Gods will was ſo fully revealed and recorded as now it is, Saints were wont to ſeeke extraordinary direction of God. As Gen. 25. 22. 
                        Rebekah when ſhe felt children ſtrugling together within her: and Ios. 7. 6. 
                        Ioſhua when Iſrael fled before the men of Ai: and Iudg. 20. 28. the other Tribes that fought againſt the Benjamites: and 2 Sam 21. 1. 
                        David when there was a famine in his land: and others on other like occaſions. The ordinary courſe under the Law was, as this here preſcribed by Moſes in this particular caſe (for which there was Lev. 16. 12. before a more generall Law) ſo burnt offerings: in which reſpect David gave this advice to Saul, 
                        1 Sam. 26. 19. 
                        If the Lord have stirred thee up againſt me, let him ſmell an offering. 
                        Gen. 8. 20, 21 
                        Noah therefore after that great evidence of Gods wrath, the flood, offered burnt offerings: and it is ſaid that The Lord ſmelled a ſweet ſavour. So 2 Sam. 24. 25. 
                        David, and that by the advice of a Prophet, to pacifie the wrath of God manifeſted by a fierce Plague, offered burnt offerings.
                     
                     
                        What burnt offerings ſet forth.As the incenſe was a type of the interceſſion of Chriſt, ſo burnt offerings, of the ſatisfactory, expiatory, and propitiatory ſacrifice of Chriſt Ieſus. Yea they were alſo viſible demonſtrations of mans guiltineſſe. For the beaſt, laid on the altar, there lay in his ſtead that brought it, and ſhewed what he had deſerved, namely not onely to be conſumed here in materiall fire, but alſo for ever to be tormented in infernall fire: and the penitents bringing of his offering was a profeſſion of his owne guiltineſſe. This by the way concerning the end of thoſe offerings which were uſed to pacifie Gods wrath.
                     
                        
As for the generall point, that meanes uſed to pacifie God, muſt be ſuch as are warranted: in two eſpeciall reſpects it appeares to be moſt equall.
                           1. In regard of God who is to be pacified.
                           2. In regard of man who is to pacifie him.
                        
                     
                     Gods will, till he himſelfe reveale it, is ſecret: his counſell unſearchable. (For Rom. 11. 34.
                        who hath knowne the mind of the Lord? or who hath beene his counſeller?) None therefore can tell what may pleaſe, or appeaſe him, till he make it knowne of himſelfe.
                     As for men, Rom. 1. 21.
                        They are vaine in their imaginations, and their fooliſh heart is darkened. How then can they of themſelves invent or conceive what may be well-pleasing to the moſt wiſe God? Take a view of all humane inventions, whether of heathens, or others, and you ſhall find them all to be very toyes, much unbeſeeming Gods excellent Majeſty: yea ſuch as give no ſatisfaction to wiſe men, that duly obſerve them: no nor to the inventers themſelves: and therefore they are ſtill thinking of adding, altering, and taking away. By mans inventions Gods wrath is more incenſed then appeaſed. In vaine (ſaith the Lord)Mat. 15. 9. 
                        do they worſhip me, teaching for doctrines the commandements of men.

The Heathen of old were wont to ſacrifice children, virgins, men, and ſuch like kinds of humane bloud: which the Iewes, giving themſelves over to all Heatheniſh idolatry, learned of them. For where 2 King. 16. 3. the Heathen gave their children to Molech,

                        Ier. 31. 35. the Iewes

alſo did ſo: not withſtanding that Lev. 18. 21. the Lord had expreſly forbid them ſo to do: and Lev. 20. 2. Pater ſilium tradebat ſacerdotibus qui faciebant dues rogos magnos, &amp; inter hos puerum traducebant. Et quidam moriebantur, quidam ſuperpius manebant. Si pater unum ex ſi ijs traduceret, reli quos ſire ſalvos, &amp; patrem in om nibus oe icem putabant.
                         made a capitall law againſt all that ſhould ſo do. As for the Heathen, they had their Oracles at which they uſed to aske counſell, and take advice in all their weighty exploits, and in all their difficulties and diſtreſſes: as Num. 27. 21. Iudg 20. 18. the people of God were wont to aske counſell of the Lord. The Heathen ſuppoſed that God gave counſell at thoſe Oracles: but it was the Devill himſelfe who moſt egregiouſly ſeduced them.

Yea further (wherein they go in inhumane cruelty beyond the Heathen) in perſecuting with fire and ſword ſuch as refuſe to be ſubject to their Deviliſh devices.

yea and ſatisfactory. What? Gods vengeance to be turned away by humane inventions? Humane inventions to ſatisfie Divine juſtice? Nor the excellency of the Divine Majeſty will admit, nor the vanity of humane apprehenſions can invent any ſuch ſatisfactions, any ſuch meanes as to avert ſuch wrath. The leaſt that can be ſaid of the beſt of the fore-ſaid meanes of ſatisfaction, is that of the Prophet, Iſa. 1. 12.

                     III. See § 25. 
                        THings warrantable in their ſubſtance muſt be performed with warrantable circumſtances. The many circumſtances which God preſcribed for doing the things which he enjoyned, give proofe hereof. For why ſhould the Divine wiſdome be ſo carefull in preſcribing circumſtances, if man might be careleſſe in obſerving them. Where the Lord enjoyneth the celebration of the Paſſeover, he thus expreſſeth it, Num. 9. 3. 
                        In the foureteenth day of this moneth, at even, ye ſhall keepe it in his appointed ſeaſon: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof ſhall ye keepe it. If men failed in circumſtances, they were puniſhed as if they had neglected the circumſtance. Inſtance Lev. 10. 1. 
                        Nadab and Abihu, that offered incenſe with ſtrange fire: and David and the Prieſts in his time that 2 Sam. 6. 3. caried the Arke in a cart which Num. 7. 9. Exo. 25. 14. Num. 4. 15. Deut. 10. 8. Ioſ 3. 3. ſhould have beene caried on mens ſhoulders. Wherefore David being better inſtructed by the viſible evidence of Gods diſpleaſure on Vzzah, ſaith afterwards, 1 Chro. 15. 13 
                        The Lord made a breach upon us, for that we ſought him not after the due order, &amp;c.
                     God having preſcribed circumſtances as well as ſubſtances, to neglect the one or the other is to croſſe his ſacred will. Yea to do things otherwiſe then he hath appointed,

when he hath appointed the rites and manner of doing any thing, is to make our ſelves wiſer then God.
                     
                        Papiſts failings in mateall circumſtances.In this reſpect we have juſt cauſe to ſeparate from the Remiſh Church, though it be granted, that for ſubſtance they hold many of Chriſts ordinances. They have the Word read, and prayers in their Churches, but in an unknowne tongue, which takes away the benefit thereof. They acknowledge Chriſt their Mediatour, High-Prieſt, Head, and Prophet: but in that they joyne Saints in heaven as Mediatours, men on earth as true, proper, ſacrificing Prieſts, their Pope a Spirituall head over the whole Church, and give him power to coine new articles of faith, they over-throw the forenamed Orthodoxall ſubſtances by theſe hereticall circumſtances. So the ſubſtance of Baptiſme which they retaine, they impeach by their additions of creame, ſpittle, and other like fooliſh inventions, and by their falſe poſitions about the abſolute neceſſity, and operative efficacy of the externall worke. The like might be exemplified in other ordinances. What warrant have they for creeping to images, proſtrating their bodies before them, offering to them, going on pilgrimages, wearing haire-ſhirts, going barefoot, whipping themſelves: mewing themſelves up in cloiſters, caves, Hermitages, with an infinite number of their owne inventions. Is God pacified with theſe? Can ſuch things appeaſe his wrath? What then can be expected for the performance of their ordinances, but this doome of the high Indge, Mat. 159.
                        In vaine they do worſhip me, teaching for doctrines the commandements of men. And this, Iſa. 1. 12.
                        who hath required this of your hand?
                     
                     
                        Goſpellers failings in mate riall circumſtances.I would to God there were no occaſion among us given to feare the like doome. True it is that we have by the Divine providence more and better light then Papiſts have, whereby the vanity of their unwarrantable additions to Gods ordinances are diſcovered and abandoned, yet many offer up their incenſe without fetching fire from the Lords altar. For ſome that draw nigh unto God with their mouth, and honour him with their lips, have their heart farre from

him. Sincerity of heart is the fire of the Lord, with which the incenſe of prayer muſt be offered up. Others in performing duties of piety ſo reſt in that which they do, as they looke not at all to Chriſt, who is the Lords altar from whence alone ſuch fire as is acceptable unto God, can be taken. Others ſo ſet their minds on mans lawes, and the penalty thereof, as God, his will, his honour, conſcience to him is not at all reſpected. In theſe and other like caſes doe men offer their incenſe with ſtrange fire.
                     
                        Direction for matter and manner to be fetcht from Gods Word. Eph. 5. 17. Rom. 12. 2. Iſa. 8. 20.It behoveth us therefore diligently to ſearch the Scriptures, thereby to underſtand what the will of the Lord is: and to prove what is good and acceptable unto him. Therein we may have ſufficient warrant for matter and manner, for ſubſtance and circumſtance. To the Law and to the teſtimony: if they ſpeake not according to this word it is becauſe there is no light in them, But what is done according to the warrant and preſcript of it, may comfortably and confidently be done; and that in aſſured expectation of Gods gracious acceptation, and bounteous remuneration.
                     On this ground we may expect a bleſſing on the duties that we now performe. For our extraordinary humbling of our ſelves with faſting and prayer is as warrantable for pacifying Gods anger, as incenſe under the Law. Let us from the Lords altar, his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, thorow faith in him take the fire of zeale, ſincerity, and integrity, and therewith offer our incenſe; of the efficacy hereof we ſhall have occaſion afterwards to ſpeake.

                        DVties of mercy muſt be performed to ſuch as wrong us. This did he, who tooke all occaſions to do ſo himſelfe, give us in expreſſe charge, Mat. 5. 44. 
                        Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you. The Law exemplifieth this generall in theſe particulars. Exod. 23. 4, 5. 
                        If thou meet thine enemies oxe or his aſſe going aſtray, thou ſhalt ſurely bring it back to him againe. If thou ſee the aſſe of him that hatcth thee
                        
                        lying under his burden, thou ſhalt ſurely helpe him. If mercy muſt be ſhewed to the beaſts of our enemies, how much more to their perſons? In this reſpect the Wiſeman thus further adviſeth, Pro. 25. 21. 
                        If thine enemy be hungry give him bread: and if he be thirſty give him water to drinke. In like manner, if they have pulled any judgement upon their owne pates, our endeavour muſt be to helpe them, to heale them.
                     1. Thus ſhall we ſhew our ſelves to be children of our Father which is in heaven. For he maketh his Sonne to ſhine on the evill and on the good, Mat. 5. 45.
                     
                        
                           Ad omnes faciamus bonum Chriſtus non pro ſanctis tantum paſſus eſt, ſed pro peccatoribus, &amp;c Aug. de Salutar. Dei. c. 46.2. Thus ſhall we be like-minded to him that let ſlip no opportunity of doing good to us his enemies, even Ieſus Christ our Saviour, Phil. 2. 5.
                     3. Thus ſhall we give evidence of the holy Spirits abode in us. For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodneſſe, Eph. 5. 9.
                     4. Thus ſhall we Overcome evill with good: which is a Divine property: thus ſhall we mollifie their hardneſſe, and bow their incenſed mind to mildnes &amp; kindnes, Rom. 12. 21.
                     
                        
                           Quando inimicis noſtris praebemus beneficia, malitiam eorum bonitate noſtra ſuperamus, &amp; mollimus duritiam, iratum
                                 
                                    
                                 
                                 que
                               animam ad molliciem, &amp; benevolentiam flectimus. Hier. Hedib. quaeſt, 15. And whereas corrupt nature is too too much addicted to revenge, by theſe meanes ſhall we leave our implacable enemies to Gods revenge, which the Wiſeman thus expreſſeth, Thou ſhalt heape coals of fire upon his head, Pro. 25. 22
                     So farre therefore we ought to be from with-holding our hands from doing mercy, becauſe he, to whom mercy is to be ſhewed, hath wronged us, as ſo much the rather to take that opportunity of doing good, that it may appeare we do good for goodneſſe ſake, without reſpect of perſons, without any partiality. Woe were it to children of men if God did not do good to his enemies. If we could overcome our ſelves, we alſo ſhould ſo do. They who are borne againe, whoſe corrupt nature is altered, will ſo do.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 32. Of ſpeedy pacifying Gods wrath.
                     V. Sec § 25. 
                        GOds wrath is with all expedition to be pacified. 
                        Exo. 32. 11. So ſoone as Moſes obſerved the wrath of the Lord to be kindled, while he was in the mount, before he came down to enquire after the cauſe thereof, he offered the ſweet incenſe of humble &amp; fervent prayer, to pacifie the ſame. When Ion. 3. 4. 
                        Ionah began to enter into Niniveh, and to threaten Gods vengeance, both King and people by faſting, prayer, and repentance prevented the judgement. They did not ſtay till the forty dayes reſpited were expired. The direction of an Heathen Monarch (but guided by the Spirit of God) is in this caſe very remarkable: it was this, Ezr. 7. 17. 21, 23. 
                        Buy ſpeedily Bullocks, Rammes, &amp;c. Whatſoever Ezra ſhall require, let it be done ſpeedily. For why ſhould there be wrath againſt the realme? 
                        Iob 1. 5. 
                        Iob was ſo ſpeedy, as upon ſuſpition that his children in their feaſting together might have ſome way or other provoked Gods wrath, offered burnt offerings for an attonement: Thus did Iob every day.
                     
                     
                        Fierceneſſe of Gods wrath.Gods wrath is as a fire. (Pſal 78. 21. Iſa. 30. 30. Ier. 15. 14. Zeph. 3. 8. Saepius ab initio flammam quidam non extin guentes, in magnum devencrant naufragium. De peccatoribus Chryſ. Hom. 22. ad Pop. to fire in Scripture it is oft reſembled) Now a fire, the longer it is ſuffered to burne, the ſtronger and more violent it waxeth. When therefore a fire is kindled, will not wiſe men make all the ſpeed that poſſibly they can to quench it? The Prophets do thus ſet out the fierceneſſe of this fire: Deut. 32. 22. 
                        A fire is kindled in the Lords anger, and ſhall burne unto the loweſt hell, and ſhall conſume the earth with her increaſe, and ſet on fire the foundations of the mountaines, &amp;c. Nah. 1. 6. 
                        Who can ſtand before his indignation? And who can abide in the fierceneſſe of his anger? His fury is powred out like fire, and the rocks are throwne downe by him. In regard of the violence of Gods wrath it is alſo reſembled to Iſa. 28. 2.—30. 28. 
                        A floud of mighty waters over-flowing. If waters once overflow and make a breach, all ſpeed muſt be uſed to make up that breach, or otherwiſe it will ſoone become irrecoverable.
                     
                        The cauſe of utter deſtructions.Hence have we a demonſtration of the folly of men, who

having incenſed the Lords wrath, continue to adde ſinne to ſinne, and to lie ſecurely therein, nor repenting, nor humbling themſelves with prayer and faſting, nor thinking any way to pacifie the Lords fiery indignation, till the fury thereof flame round about them, and that ſo fiercely, as there is little hope of quenching it. This is the cauſe of thoſe deſolations and utter deſtructions that have bene heretofore, or ſtill are made in the world. For,
                           1. Mic. 7. 18. 
                              The Lord delighteth in mercy: Were men carefull to walke in any meaſure worthy of his mercies, his godneſſe would be as an ever-ſpringing, and over-flowing fountaine ſending out ſweet ſtreames to refreſh us from time to time with all needfull bleſſings.
                           2. Iſa. 28. 21. Iudgement is his ſtrange worke: therefore he uſeth to threaten it, before he execute it. If therefore threatning of vengeance did kindly worke on men, and make them humble themſelves before the Lord, and turne from their ſinnes, he would not execute what he threatneth. Inſtance the caſe of Ion. 3. 10. 
                              Nineveh, and of Ier. 26. 18, 19. 
                              Hezekiah.
                           
                           3. God is Ion. 4. 2. 
                              ſlow to anger. Though he be provoked to begin to execute vengeance, yet is he not haſty in powring out all the vials of his wrath. He firſt begins with one. He firſt ſtriketh but ſoftely. If then men humble themſelves, and confeſſe their ſinnes with penitent hearts, he will ſay to his Angell whom he hath ſent to deſtroy, 2 Sam 24. 16. 
                              It is enough: ſtay now thine hand.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        Deferring repentance, a cauſe of much miſchiefe.The cauſe therefore of Gods ſeverity in executing vengeance, reſts in mans obſtinacy. For Pſal. 18. 26. Tamberlane ut Stephan. in Apolog pro Herodoto. 
                        With the froward God will ſhew himſelfe froward. Man perſiſts obſtinately in ſinne: and God perſiſts reſolutely in puniſhing ſinne. I have heard of a Generall, that was wont to carie with him in his Camp three ſorts of flaggs, a white, red, and black one. And when he firſt came againſt a City, he diſplayed his white flag, to ſhew, that if without reſiſtance they would yeeld, they ſhould upon acknowledging fealty to him, enjoy their lives, livings, and liberty. If they refuſed this offer, he then diſplayed a red flag, to intimate, that he intended a bloudy

battell againſt them. If notwithſtanding this menacing of bloud they obſtinately ſtood out againſt him, he laſtly diſplayed a blacke flag, giving them to wit thereby that now nothing was to be expected but utter ruine and deſolation. That practice was ſomewhat anſwerable to a Law that God made for his people, that Deut, 20. 10, 11. when they went to fight againſt a City, they ſhould firſt proclaime peace: whereof if they would not accept, they ſhould deſtroy them all. To apply this; The preaching of the Goſpell is Gods white flag. The ſeaſonable and juſt threatnings of his Miniſters, his red flag. Execution of judgement by Plague, famine, ſword, or any other like kinds, his blacke flag. How fooliſh, how ſottiſh, how rebellious againſt God, how injurious to their owne ſoules are they that not only deſpiſe the offer of mercy in the Goſpell, but alſo cary themſelves contumeliouſly againſt the threatnings of Gods Miniſters grounded on his Word, and juſtly deduced from it. Even this is our caſe: ſo have we dealt with God: and thereby provoked him to hang out this black and deadly flag of Peſtilence, whereby ſo many hundreds are weeke after weeke deſtroyed among us. This by ſpeedy humiliation and converſion might have been prevented.
                     
                        Speedy repentance very profitable.If in any caſe ſpeed and haſte be needfull, ſurely it is moſt needfull, yea and neceſſary in appeaſing the wrath of God. No fire, no floud like to it. For the point therefore in hand, what courſe ſoever ye take, (having good warrant for it) That you doe, do quickly. Whether the judgement be publique or private, on our ſelves or others, let us make no delay. Take At the time when this was preached. viz. Aug. 1625 a publique faſt was weekely celebrated. this opportunity now at length offered for publique humiliation by prayer and faſting: and what you outwardly make ſhew of before men, do inwardly and effectually before God the ſearcher of hearts. Put off no longer time. Heb. 3. 7, 8. 
                        Wherefore as the Holy Ghost ſaith, To day if ye will heare his voice harden not your heart. There is juſt cauſe to ſpeake to you in ſuch a manner, as in another caſe Act. 27. 21. 
                        Paul did to thoſe that were in the ſhip with him, Ye ſhould have harkened to Gods Miniſters, and not have looſed from your
                        
                        looſed from your covenant with God, and have gained this loſſe and harme which by fierceneſſe of the plague hath befallen us. You ſhould (as §. 6. hath beene noted of Iob) upon ſuſpition have uſed meanes to prevent this Plague: or at leaſt, when one or two in a weeke died of the Plague in the ſuburbs of the City, you ſhould have uſed all the meanes that Gods Word warranted, then and there to have ſtayed it. Have ye not heard of the counſell that Eliah gave to Ahab.
                        1 King. 18. 44. When there aroſe a little cloud out of the ſea like a mans hand, he ſaid, prepare thy chariots, and get thee downe, that the raine ſtop thee not. So upon the ſight of the ſmalleſt ſigne, and firſt beginning of this Plague, we ſhould have uſed all warrantable meanes to have prevented, if it had beene poſſible, theſe ſhowers of Gods vengeance which have day after day fallen upon us. But ſeeing thoſe opportunities have been too careleſly paſſed over, let us now be made more wiſe. Quickly ſpeedily, as quickly &amp; ſpeedily as poſſibly we can, ſeek yet to quench this fire, to make an attonement for our ſelves and others yet living.

                     §. 33. Of attonement with God after his wrath hath beene kindled.
                     VI. See §. 25. 
                        THere are meanes of reconciliation betwixt God and man, after Gods wrath is incenſed. As the charge which in this text Moſes gives to Aaron, Make an attonemēt: ſo the event which followed thereupon (Numb. 16. 47 
                        He made an attonement for the people) proves as much. So doth this anſwer which God gave to Moſes his interceſſion for the people, —14, 20. 
                        I have pardoned according to thy word. Memorable in this caſe is that meanes which at firſt God affoorded to man by the Gen. 3. 15. 
                        Seed of the woman, after he had revolted, &amp; ſo provoked the Lords wrath. All the propitiatory ſacrifices that from Abels time to Chriſts have beene offered up by Saints, give demonſtration hereof: eſpecially if the end of them, and the events following upon the offering of them be duly weighed. The end of them is thus expreſſed in the Law, Lev. 1. 4. 
                        It ſhalbe accepted for him to make an attonement for him. The events are thus ſet out, Gen. 4. 4. 
                        The Lord had reſpect to Abel, and to his offering. 
                        —8. 21. 
                        The Lord ſmelled a ſweet ſavour. 
                        Lev. 9. 23. 
                        The glory of the Lord appeared to all the people. 
                        1 Sam 7. 9. 
                        The Lord heard him. 
                        2 Sam. 24 25. 
                        The Lord was entreated for the land. 
                        2 Chro 7. 1. 
                        Fire came downe from heaven, and conſumed the burnt offering and ſacrifices; and the glory of the Lord filled the houſe. The many invitations propounded in Scripture to ſinners to come unto God, imply grounds of reconciliation betwixt God and man. Such are theſe, Iſa 1. 18. 
                        Come now, and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord. 
                        Pro 9. 5. 
                        Come eate of my bread, &amp;c. Iſa. 55. 1. 
                        Come, buy wine and milke without mony, &amp;c. Mat. 11. 28. 
                        Come unto me all ye that labour, &amp;c. Pſal. 34. 8. 
                        O taste and ſee that the Lord is good. To theſe for further confirmation, may be added the many promiſes of receiving, and accepting ſuch as come, which uſe to be annexed to the forementioned invitations. Yea and the embaſſage which God hath given to his Miniſters, who 2 Cor. 5. 20. 
                        as though God did beſeech you by us, pray you in Chriſts ſtead, be reconciled to God. But moſt evidently and plentifully is the point proved by the truth of all the legall

types, Chriſt Ieſus, 
                        Rom. 3. 25. 
                        Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation: 
                        —5. 11. 
                        by whom we have received the attonement. That word propitiation hath relation to the Exo. 25. 17, &amp;c. 
                        propitiatory under the Law, tranſlated by our Engliſh a mercy-ſeat: which was an eſpeciall type of Chriſt, in whom all the mercy of God is manifeſted to man. Where Ezek. 43. 14. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . 
                        Ezekiel maketh mention of a greater and leſſe ſettle, The LXX tranſlate it, a propitiatory: 
                           Propitiatorium minus eſt, quando i
                                 •
                               ſe Chriſtus formam ſervi accipiens &amp; propitiatorium majus quum recepit gloriam, &amp;c. Hier. Comment. l. 13. in Ezek. 43.and St. Hieron applieth the greater propitiatory to Chriſts Divine nature: and the leſſe to his humane nature. Thus as God-man is Chriſt the meanes of attonement betwixt God and man.
                     No reaſon hereof can be found out in man. For man having once rebelled againſt his Creatour, perſiſted in his rebellion: and neither offered to God, nor ſought of God any attonement. Rom. 5. 10. 
                        When we were enemies we were reconciled. The whole cauſe therfore reſteth in God: even in his free grace, and undeſerved love. For there is a peculiar love which God beareth to man: Tit. 3. 4. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . which the Apoſtle compriſeth under one compound word, which ſignifieth, love of man: and thus ſetteth downe the true reaſon of the fore-mentioned attonement, After that the kindneſſe, and love toward man of God our Saviour appeared, not by works of righteouſneſſe which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 34. Of Gods peculiar love to man.
                     1. Chryſoſtomus in lib. 1. de Prov Dei, elegantiſſimè deſcribit divinam 
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . THis peculiar love of God to man is the rather to be obſerved by man, becauſe it is ſuch a love as is proper to him, and on him onely conferred. The like hath not beene extended to any other creature whatſoever. I need not bring the ſenſleſſe creatures, either above in the viſible heavens, or below on earth, no nor any of the living, and ſenſible, but unreaſonable creatures, into compariſon. None can be ſo ſenſleſſe, or unreaſonable, as to imagine that Gods goodneſſe extended to them, can be compared to his kindneſſe ſhewed to man. There remaine therefore the Angels onely in this bleſſed contention, about more love, to be poiſed

with man. The Angels may be diſtinguiſhed into two ranks, good and evill. The evill angels, though they ſtood in as much need of ſuch mercy to be ſhewed to them as was extended to man, becauſe they implunged themſelves into as deepe a gulfe of miſerie, yet was not God pleaſed to take ſuch pitie of them. Iude v. 6. 
                        He hath reſerved them in everlaſting chaines under darkneſſe, unto the judgement of the great day. The good Angels fell not into ſuch miſery: nor ſtood in need of ſuch mercy. They were indeed by Chriſt eſtabliſhed in happineſſe, but not redeemed from miſery. The favour which they primarily had with God is everlaſtingly confirmed: new favour is not purchaſed for them. They never were at odds with God: no need therefore of attonement, of reconciliation. This is the tranſcendent, proper, and peculiar evidence of Gods love to man. 
                        Heb. 2. 16. He therefore that tooke not on him the nature of Angels, tooke on him the ſeed of Abraham.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 35. Of their deſperate condition who reject reconciliation.
                     2. WHat now may be thought of ſuch children of men, as, notwithſtanding the meanes of reconciliation and attonement, which God hath ordained and revealed for mans good, ſtill ſtand at odds with God, and maintaine enmity againſt him? Their caſe may well be accounted deſperate. 
                           Infirmi donec medicantes admittunt, multam habent ſpem ſanitatis: poſt quàm verò in mentis alienationem deciderint, immedicabiles ſunt nullo curante: non propter morbi naturam, ſed propter curantis abſentiam. Chrſ. Hom. 22. ad Pop.While they who are ſicke admit Phyſitians, and remedies, there is much hope of recovery. But if like mad men they admit no meanes for their good, they muſt needs be irrecoverable, having none to cure them: not ſo much for the nature of the diſeaſe, as for want of meanes to cure them. In this caſe they may be ſuppoſed to be worſe then Devils. Had a Redeemer been given to Devils, and an attonement by him made betwixt God and them, we cannot but think that they would moſt readily and willingly have embraced reconciliation. Yet how many children of men have there beene in all ages, in all places, againſt whom the

Lord may juſtly take up this complaint, Mat. 23. 37. 
                        How oft would I have gathered you together even as the hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! And this, Iſa. 65. 2. 
                        I have ſpread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their owne thoughts: A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face. Too too many ſuch there are among vs, who moſt ungratefully and contumeliouſly reject all the meanes which God in his goodneſſe and wiſdome hath afforded to allure and draw men to himſelfe. For meanes of reconciliation, and ſalvation, what nation hath more plentifully enjoyed them, then England, and what part of England more then London? But let the impiety and iniquity, profaneneſſe and licentiouſneſſe, drunkenneſſe, and all manner of uncleanneſſe, ſwearing and lying, debate and deceit, extortion and oppreſſion, and other like offences againſt God and man, committed in this bright light of the Goſpell, give evidence, whether reconciliation offered on Gods part be anſwerably accepted on mans part. Can we now wonder at Gods judgements among us, and heavy hand upon us? Have we not rather cauſe to admire his long ſuffering and lenity, in that he hath ſo long held his hand from ſtriking: and in that he now ſtrikes, he doth it ſo gently. For howſoever this ſtroake of the Plague conſidered in it ſelfe be heavy: yet compared to our deſerts, it is but light. Lam. 3 22.
                        It is of the Lords mercies that we are not conſumed, becauſe his compaſſions faile not.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 36. Of the penitents comfort in reconciliation.
                     3. 
                           Poenitentes, quid à ſeipſis ſuſcipit judicatos, Deus abſolvit. Cypr. Serm de Paſſ. Chriſti. POore penitent ſinners, whoſe hearts are broken with ſight and ſence of their ſinnes, may hence, and will hence receive much comfort, that there is meanes of attonement and reconciliation betwixt God and them. For God uſeth to abſolve ſuch as he obſerves to judge themſelves. This muſt needs be very cordiall to them. For true penitents that are pierced with ſence of their ſinnes, know that

while there remaines enmity betwixt God and them, they are in no better eſtate then the Devils. They find by the heavy burthen of ſinne oppreſſing their ſoules, and by their deepe apprehenſion of Gods wrath thereupon, that Gods favour is more ſweet then life it ſelfe, and infinitely to be preferred before all contents and delights that this world can affoord. To theſe Iſa. 52. 7.
                        How beautifull are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publiſheth peace, &amp;c. Take notice therefore, O ye poore in ſpirit, take notice of this ſoveraigne ground of comfort, There is meanes of reconciliation betwixt you and your God. An attonement is made. Comfort your ſoules herewith. 
                           Sufficit mihi ad omnem juſtitiam ſolum habere prepitium, cui ſoli peccavi. Bern. ſuper Cant, Serm. 23.It is ſufficient, and in ſtead of all righteouſneſſe, to have him alone, againſt whom alone I have ſinned, propitious and gracious in pardoning ſinne.
                     
                        Meanes of reconciliation to be ſought.4. Means of reconciliation being on Gods part affoorded and offered, it remaineth as a bounden duty for us, with the uttermoſt of our power to ſeeke after it. Yea it giveth good encouragement to do our beſt for partaking of the benefit thereof.
                           1. For our duty, ſhall a matter of ſo great conſequence, ſo excellent, ſo needfull, ſo uſefull a thing as reconciliation with God be publiſhed and proclaimed to us wretched rebels againſt God, and ſhould not we enquire after it? They adde much to the heape of their other ſinnes that neglect this duty. Heb. 2. 3.
                              How ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſalvation?
                           
                           2. For encouragement, what greater then this, that there is ſuch a thing, that upon due and diligent ſeeking, may and ſhalbe had. If God were implacable, irreconciliable, and would accept of no attonement, then had we cauſe to be diſcouraged from ſeeking it, but God is ſo farre from being irreconciliable, that he is moſt eaſie to be intreated. Yea by his Miniſters he 2 Cor. 5. 20. Mic. 7. 18.
                              prayeth us to be reconciled to him. Who is a God like to thee, that pardoneth iniquity, &amp;c.

                     HAving handled the meanes of attonement here preſcribed by Moſes according to the letter of the hiſtory, we will further endeavour to open the myſtery contained under it.
                     The principall meanes was offering incenſe. This may be conſidered as a ſervice to be done by man: or as a Legall Thus

                     As a type it prefigured Chriſts Interceſſion.
                     
                     That it ſet out prayer, is evident by the Pſalmiſts application of the one to the other, where he ſaith, Pſal. 141. 2. 
                        Let my prayer be ſet before thee as incenſe. This alſo is meant by the Lord, where he ſaith, Mal. 1. 11. 
                        In every place incenſe ſhalbe offered to my name.
                     
                     The reſemblance of prayer to incenſe, is in many reſpects very apt. For,

                     §. 38. Of incenſe typifying Chriſt.
                     THat Incenſe was a type of Chriſt; may be collected by the Apoſtles ſpecifying the Heb. 9. 4. 
                        golden cenſer, which was onely for incenſe, among other Legall types of Chriſt. The golden cenſer was a type by reaſon of the incenſe, for which it was made: much more therfore muſt the incenſe it ſelfe be How ſundry types may be applied to Chriſt. a type. If it be demanded how the one and the other too could be a type of Chriſt; I anſwer, In regard of ſeverall matters appertaining to Chriſt. Some types ſet out one of Chriſts natures, others another: Some his perſon, others his offices: againe, others, ſpeciall benefits that the Church reaped by Chriſt. In a word, the ſundry and ſeverall types under the Law, ſet out ſundry and ſeverall excellencies that were in Chriſt, and ſundry and ſeverall benefits that iſſue from him.
                     That the fitneſſe of the types here mentioned may be the better diſcerned, I will paralell, and ſet out the incenſe, cenſer, fire, and altar in ſuch manner as with good probability may be applied to Chriſt.

                        2 Cor. 5. 18. 
                        God hath reconciled us to himſelfe by Ieſus Chriſt: 
                        Rom 3. 25. 
                        whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation. Therefore Hebr. 1. 3. 
                        when he had by himſelfe purged our ſinnes, he ſate downe on the right hand of the Majeſty on high: where —7. 25. 
                        he ever liveth to make interceſſion for us. On which ground the Apoſtle maketh this holy challenge, Rom. 8. 34. 
                        Who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that died: yea rather that is riſen againe, and is even at the right hand of God: who alſo maketh interceſſion for us. Thus we ſee how plentifull and evident the holy Scripture is in this principle of our Chriſtian Faith.
                     
                        1 Tim. 3. 16. Chriſt being true God, 
                        Mat. 17. 5. his Fathers beloved Sonne in whom he is well pleaſed: and having Heb. 9. 12. 
                        by his owne bloud obtained eternall redemption, he hath a power and right to quench the fire of Gods wrath, and to make peace betwixt God and man. The dignity of his perſon, and the all-ſufficiency of his ſacrifice have made way thereto. The like can not juſtly be ſaid of any other meanes whatſoever, in heaven, or in earth. Wherefore 1 Tim. 2 5. 
                        There is one (one onely) Mediatour betwixt God and man, the man Chriſt Ieſus.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 39. Of the vanity of meere creatures interceſsion.
                     SVrely they do more incenſe then appeaſe God, who to the heape of their other ſinnes adde this high pitch of preſumption, Interceſſion of men or Angels. Can mans invented incenſe, offered up with ſtrange fire, pacifie Gods wrath? For, interceſſion of men and Angels is a meere humane invention: never could any Papiſt give any good proofe for it out of Gods Word: nor ever hereafter can any do it. That which is not in Gods Word cannot be drawne out of it. This is ſuch ſtrange fire, as will devoure them that uſe it: even as Lev. 10. 1, 2. 
                        The fire that went out from the Lord devoured Nadab and Abihu: and as Numb. 16. 35. that which conſumed the two hundred and fifty men that (being of the conſpiracy of Korah) offered incenſe: incenſe that much incenſed the fire of Gods wrath. To reaſon the caſe a little with our adverſaries; Why do they not content themſelves with that pure, and ſweet incenſe that Chriſt our great Prieſt offereth up? Is it not ſufficient? Need any thing, can any thing be added to the dignity and efficacy of that which Chriſt doth? Can man or Angell do any thing more then God-man? Are any more beloved of the Father then he?
                     But they pretend humility forſooth. Sinfull men are unworthy to go to ſo worthy a Mediatour as the Sonne of God. Therefore they have the Spirits of just men made perfect in heaven, and the holy Angels to be their Mediatours.
                     
                        Anſw. 1. Pretence of humility without warrant of Gods Word is high preſumption. 
                           Hypocriſin hu militatis. Oecu men. in Col. 2. 19. He fitly ſtiled this kind of humility, that ſtiled it, a ſhew, or a maske of humility, counterfeit humility: And 
                           Vulgò dicitur qui divitem affectat thelo-dives, qui ſapientem thelo-ſapiens. Ergò &amp; hic thelo humilis dici tur(i) affectans humilitatem. Aug. Epiſt. ad Paulin, he more finely, that by a new coined word, compounded part of Greeke, and part of Latin, called it Thelo-humilitatem, will-humility, voluntary, or affected humility: which is plaine and palpable arrogancy.
                     
                        
2. Though Angels and Saints in heaven be more perfect then men on earth, yet are they not worthy of ſuch an office, as to be Mediators &amp; Interceſſors to God for others. Or this office of Interceſſion is too much vilified, or celeſtiall creatures too much dignified and deified by accounting them Interceſſours in relation to God.
                     3. Chriſt himſelfe is deprived of one of his prime functions, and honours, by aſcribing it to others: or at leaſt he hath co-partners, and aſſiſtants joyned with him. Which to do is intollerable preſumption.
                     4. The love of Chriſt to man is thereby exceedingly impeached. For he was made like to his brethren, that he might be a mercifull and faithfull High-Prieſt in things pertaining to 
                        Hebr 2. 17. 
                        God, &amp;c. This end of his taking our nature on him, is fruſtrated, if we need other Mediatours to him. To what end is he made man, if there need other Mediatours to preſent us to him? Wherein appeares he to be ſo mercifull, if of our ſelves we may not have acceſſe to him, who was made as our ſelves, a Sonne of man?
                     
                     The excellency, neceſſity, ſufficiency, and commodity of Well uſe, and truſt to Chriſts interceſſion. Chriſts interceſſion being by the Goſpell evidently revealed unto us, it becommeth us to take ſuch notice thereof, and to be ſo inſtructed therein, as we may in all our needs wiſely uſe it, and confidently truſt to it.
                     They wiſely uſe it, that on all occaſions, when they approach to God, have the eye of their ſoule fixed on Chriſt abiding in heaven at Gods right hand, and making interceſſion, &amp; thorow his mediation and interceſſion preſent their perſons, their prayers, and all their holy ſervices to God the Father. Eſpecially when Gods wrath is provoked, and any ſignes thereof begin to manifeſt themſelves, then to humble their ſoules at the throne of grace: then thorow the interceſſion of Chriſt to crave mercy and pardon. That forme wherwith the Church uſeth to conclude her prayers (thorow Ieſus Chriſt our Lord) is a worthy form, and pertinent to the point in hand. In uſing the words, our heart ought to be lift up unto Chriſt, and ſet on him ſitting on Gods right hand.

Yea, though ſuch words be not alwayes expreſſed, yet every petition made to God, every thanks offered to him, every thing wherein we have to do with God, muſt in mind and heart be intended thorow the mediation and interceſſion of Chriſt. We read of incenſe offered with the prayers of Saints, the ſmoke whereof aſcended before God. This incenſe is the Rev. 8. 3, 4. interceſſion of Chriſt.
                     They truſt to his interceſſion, who uſe no others but his, and in the uſe of his, reſt confidently that they ſhalbe accepted. Thus may we, thus muſt we do. We may do it, becauſe what ſoever is in us to diſcourage us, or any way to make us doubt of acceptance, is ſo abundantly ſupplied in Chriſt, as all matter of doubt and feare is thereby taken away. We muſt do it for the honour of Chriſt, for the comfort of our owne ſoules. Chriſt is much honoured by the ſtedfaſt faith of his Saints, Thereby the dignity of his perſon, the merit of his ſacrifice, the favour of his Father, the efficacy of his interceſſion, and other his Divine excellencies are acknowledged. The ſoule of him that in faith expecteth thorow Chriſt acceptation, cannot but be much comforted. This was it that much encouraged, and comforted Stephen, even then when his malicious enemies gnaſhed on him with their 
                        Act. 7. 54, 55. 
                        teeth, that he ſaw Ieſus ſtanding on the right hand of God. That of Stephen was extraordinary. For the heavens were actually, really opened, and Chriſt in that body, wherein he was ſeene on earth, and wherewith he aſcended into heaven, appeared unto him, being in the higheſt heaven. Stephens ſight was alſo extraordinarily quickned, and enabled diſtinctly to perceive and diſcerne a viſible object ſo far off. Such an extraordinary bodily ſight of Chriſt is not to be expected of us. Yet as truly, and to as great comfort of ſoule may we with the ſpirituall eye of the ſoule, the eye of faith, ſee Chriſt ſitting in heaven for us: as it is ſaid of Moſes, By faith he endured, as ſeeing him who is inviſible. 
                        Heb. 11. 27. Thus to eye Chriſt with his incenſe, his interceſſion before God, in dangers and diſtreſſes, in feares and perplexities, while we live, when we are giving up the ghoſt, can not

but bring unſpeakeable comfort to the ſoule.

                              When Gods wrath is gone out, attonement muſt be made.

                     That Gods wrath was gone out, he proves by the effect thereof: which may be thus framed.
                           
                              When a plague is begun, Gods wrath is gone out.

                        is gone out, a manifeſtation thereof by an outward evidence is ſignified. It is oppoſed to keeping in, or hiding cloſe and ſecret. What things men would not have ſeene or knowne, they keepe in. What they would have ſeene and knowne, they ſuffer to go out. In this reſpect wrath is here ſaid to go out. It imports, that God was ſo provoked as he could not keep in his wrath.
                     
                        From the Lord, or word for word,

                        From the face of the Lord. When a man is angry, paſſion will ſoone manifeſt it ſelfe in his face, by bringing bloud into it, and making it hot, by bending his browes, by a fierce caſt of the eyes, and other like ſignes. In which reſpect wrath is ſaid to come from the face of a man, that is, in and by the face to ſhew it ſelfe. Thus by a Metaphor, and by reſemblance to man, when the Lord doth by any viſible ſignes manifeſt his wrath, it is ſaid to come from his face; that is, as our Engliſh according to the uſuall acception of the Hebrew phraſe, hath tranſlated it, From the Lord.
                     
                     The great, ineffable, and moſt proper name of God,

                        Iehovah, is here expreſſed. When matters of favor are applied Of the title Iehovah, See the Churches Conquest on Exo. 17. 15. §. 72. to this name Iehovah, they are much amplified thereby. They are the favours of Iehovah. But when wrath is attributed to him, it is much aggravated. The wrath of Iehovah, muſt needs be a wrath that makes all to tremble.

                        Anſw. Not properly, as in a man, a paſſion diſtinct from the Eſſence. For God is a moſt ſimple and pure Eſſence. He is all Eſſence. There is nothing in him different from his Eſſence. The things that are attributed unto him, are ſpoken of him onely by way of reſemblance, for teaching ſake: to make us ſomewhat more diſtinctly conceive Gods dealing with us. Anger in man is a paſſion whereby upon apprehenſion of ſome evill done, he is ſtirred up to puniſh him that hath done it. The evill that ſtirreth up anger is either a true evill that juſtly deſerveth to be puniſhed, and in that reſpect anger is deſervedly provoked: as Exo. 11. 8. 
                        Moſes his anger was provoked at Pharaohs obſtinacy: Or only an evill in appearance, or in the apprehenſion of him that is angry: and in that reſpect unjuſtly incenſed: as 1 Sam. 20. 30 Si off
                                 •
                              nditur debet iroſci: ſi iraſcitur debet ulciſci. Nam &amp; ultic fructus eſt irae: &amp; ira debitum offē ſae. Tertul, adverſ. Marciō. l. 1 
                        Sauls anger againſt Ionathan.
                     
                     
                        Anger attributed to God ſetteth out his diſlike of evill and his reſolution to puniſh evill doers. God can not miſtake: the evill at which he is at any time angry is indeed evill. When any way God manifeſteth his diſlike and his reſolution to puniſh, he is ſaid to be angry. Thus Rom. 1. 18. 
                        the wrath of God is revealed from heaven againſt all ungodlineſſe: that is, God who is in heaven manifeſteth from thence his diſlike of ungodlineſſe, and his purpoſe to take vengeance thereof. And becauſe that diſlike and purpoſe to puniſh uſeth to be manifeſted ſometimes by threatning ſo to do, and ſomtimes by putting his purpoſe into execution, and performing it, ſuch his threatning and executing of judgement is called the anger or wrath of God. Who can tell (ſaith the King of

Nineveh) if God will turne away from his fierce anger? By Ion 3. 9. anger he meaneth Ionahs threatning of vengeance: for no puniſhment was then inflicted. But where Rom. 25. the Apoſtle ſaith, Thou treaſurest up to thy ſelfe wrath, he meaneth judgement: as is further evident by this phraſe, Rom. 35.

                        God inflicteth wrath, that is, taketh vengcance, as our Engliſh turnes it.
                     To apply theſe, as to diſlike, and to purpoſe to puniſh ſinners, or to threaten vengeance, or to execute judgement may be attributed to God, ſo to be angry. And as Gods threatning, and execution of judgement is leſſe or more terrible, ſo his wrath: therefore to manifeſt and aggravate the terrours thereof, ſundry Metaphors and Epithites are added thereto: as Pſal. 69. 24.

                     According to the perſons with whom God is angry, may his anger be diſtinguiſhed:
                           1. By reaſon of the fleſh in his beſt Saints on earth, they oft provoke his wrath, as Exo. 4. 14. Deut. 3. 26. 
                              Maſes did, againſt whom the anger of the Lord is ſaid to be kindled. This anger is as a Fathers compaſſion. Of this it is ſaid Pſal. 103. 9.

                              He will not keepe it for ever. This anger ariſeth from his mercy.
                           2. By reaſon of their rebellious diſpoſition others do ſo farre incenſe his wrath, as it proves implacable. Againſt ſuch, ſaith the Lord, 2 King 22. 17 
                              My wrath ſhalbe kindled, and ſhall not be quenched. 
                              Pſal. 21. 9. Dominum ctiam bonis ſuis ſervis ſuccenſintem intelligi datur. Aug Quaeſt. ſuper Ioſ. lib. 6 
                              The Lord will ſwallow up ſuch in his wrath. This anger is as the paſſion of a Iudge.
                        
                     
                     From all theſe premiſſes this concluſion followeth.
                     
                        Wrath may come from God. He may be provoked thereto: and that by all ſorts, Saints and others, as hath beene ſhewed before. Scarce any other thing is more frequently attributed to God, then anger. Not by reaſon of any forwardneſſe in him to anger. For Ion 42. 
                        The Lord is ſlow to anger, 
                        Exo. 34. 6. 
                        Long-ſuffering, 
                        Neh. 9 17. 
                        Ready to pardon: and when he hath threatned, or begun to inflict judgement, he is ſoone brought to Ion. 4. 2. 2 Sam. 24. 16. 
                        repent him of the evill. But by reaſon of mans provoking diſpoſition:

By ſinne (whereunto men are exceedingly addicted) Gods wrath is kindled: by aggravation of ſinne, the fire of Gods wrath is inflamed: and by obſtinate continuance the rein, and impenitenty, that flame becomes unquenchable. Now ſinne, being contrary to the righteouſneſſe of his will, his juſtice, his truth, his wiſdome and other like Divine excellencies, will not ſuffer the fire of his wrath to lie alwayes ſmothered: but rather ſtirre him up to ſend it out againſt

                     §. 43. Of the lawfulneſſe of anger.
                     1. THis great inſtance of Gods being angry, gives an evident demonſtration of the lawfulneſſe of anger. 
                           Nobis hominibus conceſſum eſt, ut ad indignae alicujus rei faciem moveamur? tranquillitatem
                                 
                                    
                                 
                                 que
                               mē tis velut lenis quaedam aura conturbet, &amp;c. Hier. Comment. l. 2. in Eph. 4. For nothing ſimply ſinfull and unlawfull is attributed to God. Our Saviour who tooke upon him our nature was free from all ſinne. 2 Cor. 5. 21. 
                        He knew no ſinne. He knew himſelfe better then any other could. Had he had any ſinne, he muſt needs have knowne it. But he was 1 Pet. 1. 19. 
                        A Lambe without blemiſh, and without ſpot: 
                        Heb. 7. 26. 
                        Holy, harmleſſe, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners: yet Mar. 35 was he angry. So were ſundry Saints on juſt occaſions noted to be angry, yet not blamed: as Numb. 16. 150 
                        Moſes, 
                        2 Sam. 13. 21. 
                        David, 
                        Neh. 5. 6. 
                        Nehemiah, and others.
                     Anger is one of the affections. Affections in themſelves are no more evill, then underſtanding, will, memory, and other faculties of the ſoule.
                     
                        Ob. They are all of them by naturall corruption perverted and polluted.
                     
                        Anſw. 1. We may diſtinguiſh betwixt the eſſence of the How anger is good. ſoule with the faculties thereof, and the corruption of them which is accidentall. Thus the eſſence is good, though the accident be evill.
                     2. That which is corrupted may be renewed. Thus anger

and other affections are accounted good and lawfull by vertue of the Spirits renewing them.
                     2. Ob. 
                        Gal. 5 20. The Apoſtle reckoneth wrath among the fruits of the fleſh: and Col. 3. 8. How anger accounted evill. exhorteth to put it away.
                     
                     
                        Anſw. He meaneth wrath and anger as perverted and corrupted. Eph. 4. 26. In another place he implieth that a man may be angry and yet not ſinne.
                     
                        Queſt. Why then is wrath put into the catalogue of ſuch things as are ſimply evill, as Col 3. 8. 
                        wrath, anger, maliciouſneſſe, 
                        Gal. 5. 19, 20. 
                        idolatry, adultery, witch-craft, &amp;c.
                     
                        Anſw. Becauſe it is a violent paſſion: and by man, though regenerate, very hardly kept in compaſſe. Moſes, a 
                           Ira eſt irrationalis impetus, &amp; canis impudens. Chryſ. ad Pop. Hom 30. Num. 12. 3. man in a great meaſure regenerate, yea and very meeke above all the men which were upon the face of the earth, yet being on a great cauſe angry, ſo exceeded therein, as he little regarded the Tables wherin God with his own hand had written the Morall Law, but Exo. 32. 19. 
                        threw them out of his hands, and brake them. So Act. 15 39. 
                        Paul and Barnabas, men endewed with extraordinary ſpirits, yet being ſtirred with anger, grew ſo hot, as They departed aſunder one from the other. The corrupt fleſh ever abides even in the beſt Saints ſo long as they abide in this corruptible fleſh: and though they be regenerate, yet much corruption lieth as dreggs at the bottome. Hence is it, that if that perſon in whom the ſweet liquour of the ſanctifying Spirit aboundeth, be moved in his paſſions (as ſweet water in a glaſſe having dreggs, being ſhaken) corruption will ariſe, and taint that paſſion.
                     
                        Quest. By what meanes eſpecially is wrath perverted, How is anger perverted. and made evill?
                     
                        Anſ. By the ſame that all other affections are perverted: which are generally two.
                           1. Miſ-placing them.
                           2. Miſ-ordering them.
                        
                     
                     Anger is miſ-placed when it is ſet upon a wrong object: namely upon that which is good and praiſe-worthy. For anger is one of the diſliking affections: the object whereof ought to be evill. Evill is to be feared, and hated, and grieved
                        
for: and at evill we ought to be angry. Cain was angry at Gods accepting his brothers ſacrifice: and Saul at the juſt praiſes given to David. Their anger therefore by reaſon of 
                           Si mihi iraſcatur Deus, num illi ego ſimiliter rediraſcar? Non uti
                                 
                                    
                                 
                                 que
                              , ſed pavebo, ſed contremiſcam, ſed veniam deprecabor. Ber. ſuper Cant. Serm. 83. miſ-placing it, was evill. But moſt evilly miſ-applied is their anger, which is caſt on God. Herein Ionah much failed (Ion. 4. 4, 9.) But Cain much more (Gen. 4. 5.) If God be angry with me, ſhall I againe be angry with him? In no wiſe: but I will rather feare, and tremble, and crave pardon of him.
                     Anger is miſ-ordered, when it is unadviſedly, or immeaſurably moved. Our Lord ſaith, that Mat. 5. 22. 
                        he that is angry with his brother without cauſe or 
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                            
                           temerè.
                         unadviſedly, or raſhly, ſhalbe in danger of the judgement. 
                        Ion. 4. 4. Canis eſt impudens ira: ſed lege audire diſcat. Si ſuerit canis in grege tam ferus ut non obediat jubenti paſtori, omnia perdita ſunt. Sed ſi diſcit audire, utilis erit contra lupos, &amp; contra piratos, &amp;c. Chryſ. ad Pop. Hom. 30. Thus was Ionah angry overraſhly, and without cauſe.
                     
                        Immeaſurably angry are they that ſo exceed in paſſion, as inwardly they are diſturbed in their memory, and outwardly manifeſt as much by outragious words and actions: as Saul, 1 Sam. 20. 30, 33.
                     Had Stoicks and others (that hold all paſſions to be unbeſeeming wiſe men) well diſcerned betwixt the nature and corruption of paſſions, they would eaſily have found out their owne miſtakings. For anger is as a ſhepheards dog, which if he be not at his maſters call, to run, or returne, and do this or that, may be very pernicious: but if he be ordered by his maſter, he may be very profitable againſt wolves and theeves.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 44. Of the matter of mourning which the provocations of Gods wrath give.
                     2. THe maine point that Anger is in God, and wrath may come from him, gives great matter of humiliation, in regard of the many great provocations thereof day after day. We know that fire is very fierce where it finds matter to worke upon. Would it not thereupon much grieve and perplexe men, to ſee deſperate fellowes in every houſe blowing up fire to make it catch hold on houſes. More deſperate are impudent and impenitent ſinners. For no fire ſo fierce, ſo fearefull as Gods wrath. No ſuch meanes to kindle and enflame fire, as ſin to incenſe Gods wrath. No ſuch danger and dammage can come by any fire, as by the wrath of God. Were not the patience of the Lord more then ordinary, whereby the fire of his wrath is kept from flaming Ier 9. 1, 2. Tu hominem quidem exacerbans, amicos rogas, &amp; pecunia

Hom. 46. out, our houſes, our villages, our Cities, our nations, yea, the whole world, and all therein would ſoone be utterly conſumed. O let not the conſideration of Gods wrath be paſſed over with an unrelenting heart, or with dry eyes. I am ſure, if it be well weighed, and deeply layed to heart, it will give juſt occaſion to every one of us to cry out and ſay, Oh that mine eyes were waters, and mine eyes a fountaine of teares, that I might weepe day and night for the many provocations of the wrath of the Lord. Oh that I had in the wilderneſſe a lodging of wayfairing men, that I might leave my people, and go from them: For they are all deſperately ſet to incenſe the wrath of the Lord more and more, till they and all they have be brought to nought. Were the terrour of the Lords wrath better knowne and believed then it is, it would certainely reſtraine mens exceſſe in provoking the ſame: and make them more carefull and diligent to pacifie it. If men be incenſed, what paines is taken, what friends are uſed, what coſt is expended, what time is waſted with waiting to pacifie them? If the offender be once, twice, yea many times

rejected, yet will he not give over. Is any ſuch thing done to pacifie God?
                     To aggravate this point, let the Title whereby the Lord The terrour of the wrath of Iehovah. See The Churches Conqueſt on Exo. 17. 15. §. 72. of this title IEHOVAH. Prov. 19. 12. is here ſet forth, be noted. It is IEHOVAH. The wrath of Iehovah: that is, the wrath of that great God, who hath his being of himſelfe, who giveth being to all, on whom all depend, who hath power to ſave, and to deſtroy, who can inflict judgements that will make the ſtouteſt to quake, that can caſt body and ſoule into hell. The Wiſeman ſaith, that The Kings wrath is like the roaring of a Lyon. Now conſider, when a Lyon hath eſpied his prey, (ſuppoſe a Lambe, Kid, or any ſuch thing) and runneth and roareth after it, how that ſilly prey quaketh and trembleth. The Lyon hath roared, who will not be afraid, 
                        Am. 3. 8. ſaith the Prophet?
                     Now if the wrath of a King (who is but a mortall man, who may ſoone be taken away) who is not able to doe what he will, be ſo terrible; what is the wrath of the eternall, almighty Iehovah? The foreſaid wiſe man ſaith of the foreſaid wrath of a King, He that provoketh him 
                        Prov. 20 2. 
                        unto anger ſinneth againſt his owne ſoule, meaning his temporall life. But he that provoketh Iehovah unto anger, ſinneth indeed againſt his owne ſoule in the uttermoſt 
                           Horrendum eſt incidere in manus Dei viuentis, offendere Creatorem, recalcitrate Dominantis imperio, qui habet poteſtatem corpus &amp; animam pouere in gehennam. Bern Serm. in feſto Mar Magd. extent that may be, even against his temporall, and eternall life. O then to heare, or to ſee any evidence, as now we doe, that wrath is gone from Iehovah, how ſhould it make us to tremble, to humble our ſelves, to fall downe upon our faces, as Moſes and Aaron 
                        §. 24. Prov. 16. 14. here did, and to doe all that may be to pacifie the ſame. Where Salomon ſaith, The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death, He addeth, A wiſe man will pacifie it. Let us therefore ſhew our ſelves wiſe, and be ſo farre from provoking and incenſing the wrath of Iehovah, as we do to the uttermoſt what lieth in us, to pacifie the ſame. For which there are § 27. 30. directions before preſcribed.

IT is an eſpeciall point of wiſdome to take due notice of thoſe ſinnes which among others do moſt provoke Gods wrath: that we may know when to be moſt humbled, what to be moſt watchfull againſt, and againſt what moſt to pray. Gods word giveth us beſt direction herein. Out of it, I will endeavour to collect ſuch as heretofore have exceedingly incenſed him, and cauſed him in wrath to execute fearefull judgements.

                        Neh. 13. 18. 
                        Ye bring (ſaith Nehemiah) more wrath upon Iſrael by prophaning the Sabboth. Sacred times, places, and ordinances are in ſpeciall manner for the honour of God. To prophane them is an high diſhonour to God. Iuſt cauſe there is therefore for God to be angry with ſuch.
                     3. Pollution of profeſſion: as when Profeſſours of the true

Religion mixe themſelves with prophane perſons, and joyne themſelves with them in mariage, ſociety, amity, confederacy, &amp;c. Yea, and every way faſhion themſelves like to them, in ſpeech, in geſture, in apparell, in paſtimes, &amp;c. Gen. 6. 3. This ſo incenſed Gods wrath againſt the old world, as he ſwept them all away with a floud. 2 Chro. 19. 2 
                        Wrath is ſaid to come upon Iehoſaphat from the Lord, for this very thing. Deut. 7 4. Rev. 14 9, 10. By feare of Gods wrath Gods people is oft deterred from all ſuch commixtion. Profeſſion of Gods name is a ſacred Rom. 2. 24. thing: it engageth God, and bringeth him to a part or a ſide. Ezek. 36. 20. By polluting it, his ſacred name is blaſphemed.
                     4. Ingratitude, or a diſ-reſpecting, deſpiſing, and vilifying of Gods mercies, favours, and bleſſings. Thus Numb. 11, 6, 10. 
                        The anger of the Lord was kindled greatly againſt Iſrael for their light account of Manna. And Deut 32. 18, 19. he abhorred them, becauſe they were unmindfull of the rocke that begat them: and had forgotten God that formed them. Ingratitude is a ſinne hatefull 
                           Ingratitudinem prorſus odit ani ma mea Peremp toria ſiquidem res eſt ingratitudo, hoſtis gratiae, inimica ſalutis, Nhilita d

It makes God repent him of the kindneſſe he hath done: and thereupon to alter his mind, and to turne favour into fury. On this ground 1 Sam. 15. 11. it repented God that he had ſet up Saul to be King: And —16. 14. 
                        The ſpirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evill ſpirit from the Lord troubled him. 
                        Psal 95. 10, 11. By Iſraels ingratitude God was provoked in wrath to ſweare that they ſhould not enter into his reſt. 
                        2 Chro. 32. 25. 
                        Hezekiah rendred not againe according to the benefit done unto him: but his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, &amp;c.
                     5. Magiſtrates abuſe of their authority. 
                        Hoſ 5. 10. 
                        The Princes of Iudah were like them that remove the bound: therefore I will powre out my wrath upon them, ſaith the Lord. 2 King. 23. 26. 
                        The Lord turned not from the fierceneſſe of his great wrath wherewith his wrath was kindled against Iudah, becauſe of all the provocations that Manaſheh had provoked him withall. 
                        Pſal 82. 6. 2 Chro. 19. 6. Magiſtrates are on earth as Gods: they beare his image, ſtand in his roome, are to execute his judgements. By their abuſe of their authority God is highly diſhonored, and his image diſgraced: ſo as he can not but manifeſt his indignation againſt ſuch.
                     
                        
6. Ministers perverting their function: and that by encouraging and emboldening the wicked: and by diſcouraging and diſcountenancing the upright. Ezek. 13. 12, 13. The Prophet thus in the name of the Lord denounceth Gods wrath againſt ſuch Miniſters as build up their wall with untempered morter, 
                        
                           Quia lae

                        I will even rent it with a ſtormy wind in my fury: and there ſhalbe an over-flowing ſhower in mine anger, and great hailestones in my fury to conſume it. Take inſtance of the fearefull effects of Gods wrath againſt 1 Sam. 2. 29, &amp;c.—3. 12, &amp;c. 
                        Elies houſe. 2 Cor. 5. 20. Miniſters alſo of Gods Word do in another kind beare Gods image, ſtand in his roome, and are inſtructed with his counſels. By their perverting therefore of their function God is much diſhonoured, and his wrath muſt needs be much incenſed.
                     7. Inhumanity, or trampling on ſuch as are caſt downe. Ezek. 35. 5, 11. Thus did Edom on Iſrael, they executed cruelty on them in the time of their calamity, Therefore as I live, ſaith the Lord, I will do even according to thine anger, &amp;c. On ſuch a ground the Lord alſo thus in wrath menaceth the Heathen, Zac. 1. 15. 
                        I am ſore diſpleaſed at the Heathen that are at eaſe: for I was but a little diſpleaſed, and they helped forward the affliction. 
                        2 Chro. 28. 6. 7, &amp;c. 
                        Pekah a King of Iſrael having ſlaine many of the children of Iudah, the children of Iſrael tooke of all ſorts, even women and children 200000 to cary them away captives. But a Prophet of the Lord reſtrained their fury by this ſpeech, Deliver the captives againe: for the fierce wrath of the Lord is upon you. Such inhumanity, as it is in it ſelf a moſt odious vice, ſo more then moſt odious in his ſight, who is a God of pitty and compaſſion. Pſal. 69. 21, 24. To them therfore, againſt ſuch as in thirſt gave vineger to drinke, he thus cryeth, Powre out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathfull anger take hold of them.
                     
                     8. Conſpiracy, and joynt conſent of all ſorts in all manner of ſinnes. Ier. 32. 31, 32. 
                        This City (ſaith the Lord of Ieruſalem) hath beene to me a provocation of mine anger, and of my fury, &amp;c. Becauſe of all the evill which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their Kings, their Princes, their Prieſts, and their
                        
                        Prophets, and the men of Iudah, and inhabitants of Ieruſalem. And in another Prophet to like purpoſe thus ſaith the Lord, Ezek. 22. 30, 31. 
                        I ſought for a man among them that ſhould make up the hedge, and ſtand in the gap before me for the land, that I ſhould not deſtory it: but I found none. Therfore have I powred out mine indignation upon them, I have conſumed them with the fire of my wrath. 
                        Gen. 18. 24, &amp;c. The integrity of ſome (though but a few among many wicked) is a meanes to with-hold the wrath of him who will not ſlay the righteous with the wicked. But when there is none to ſtand in the gap, how ſhould his wrath be ſtayed?
                     9. Obſtinacy: when men will not be reclaimed, but hate to be reformed. This provoked God to ſay to his owne 
                           Sicut obdurata corpora &amp; dura non obſequuntur manibus medicorum: ſic &amp; animae obdurate non obſequuntur verbo Dei. Chryſ. in Heb. 3. Hom. 6. people, Ezek. 20. 21. 
                        I would powre out my fury upon them, to accompliſh mine anger againſt them. Obſtinacy Iſa. 5. 24, 25. after God hath given his Law and Word to his people, and given Numb. 16. 32, 35. former evidences of his wrath againſt them, moſt incenſeth Divine fury. 2 Chr. 36. 16. Peccantes non dolere magis Deum indignari facit &amp; iraſci, quam peccare. Chryſ. ad Pop. Hom. 
                              •
                           6. Cui deeſt fiducia, januam ſibi reſt piſcendi ſemolobfirmavit, &amp; ad curriculum aditum intercluſit. Chryſ. pri. par. ad Theod. lapſ. 
                        They mocked the meſſengers of God, and deſpiſed his words, and miſ-uſed his Prophets, untill the wrath of the Lord aroſe against his people, till there was no remedy. Not to be moved with ſinne, more incenſeth God, then to ſinne.
                     10. Infidelity. By this men put away the only means of quenching the fire of Gods wrath, Chriſt, his bloud, his interceſſion. Ioh 3. 36. See more of this ſinne in The whole armour of God, on Epheſ 6. 16. Treat. 2. Part 6. §. 34. 
                        He that believeth not the Son ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him. This ſinne is directly againſt the Goſpell, againſt the mercy, truth, power, and other like attributes of God. Numb. 20. 12 Deut 3 26. Mafignus nihil non tentat, quo nobis diſſidentem cogitationem inſerat. Chryſ prior. Par. ad Theod. For this was God angry even with Moſes, and ſuffered him not to enter into the land of promiſe. The evill one every way aſſayes to worke diſſidence in men. Thus dealt he with Adam, and prevailed, (Gen. 3. 1.) Thus dealt he with Chriſt, but nought availed, Mat. 4. 3, 4.
                     
                        
11. Impenitency. To ſuch an one ſaith the Apoſtle, Rom. 2. 5. De nulla re ſic iraſcitur Deus, quemodo ſi peccator ſuperbiat, &amp; erectus ac rigidus non ſera. tur in ſletum, nec miſericordiam poſtulet pro delicto. Hier. Comment. l. 3. in Eph. 5. 
                        After thine hardneſſe and impenitent heart, thou treaſureſt up unto thy ſelfe wrath againſt the day of wrath. Great is that mercy that by the Goſpell is offered to ſinners. That thereby God may not be thought to boulſter up ſinners, Repentance is required. Therefore he that came to ſave ſinners, ſaith, Mat. 9. 13. Impoenitentia eſt delietum maximum, &amp; blaſphemia irremiſſibi lis Bern. ſuper Cant. Serm. 38. 
                        I am come to call ſinners to repentance. To live under the Goſpell of Chriſt, and to live in ſinne, is to pervert the end of Chriſts comming, to abuſe mercy, to ſcandalize the Word of grace. What then can be expected of ſuch, but wrath? Iuſtly may it be accounted the greateſt ſinne.
                     12. Apoſtaſie. By this men withdraw themſelves from God. Heb. 10. 38. In them therefore God can have no pleaſure. They depart from the comfortable ſun-ſhine of his mercy, and caſt themſelves into the ſcalding heat of his wrath. Moſes foretelling the fearefull judgements which ſhould befall the Iſraelites, as evidences and effects of Gods wrath, ſheweth that every one could tell the cauſe thereof. For when all nations ſhould aske, Deut. 29. 24, 25. Diſcedens a Domino ſalutem haberenon poteſt, Ambr. in Pſal. 118. Serm. 15. 
                        Wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto this land? What meaneth the heat of this great anger? Then men ſhall ſay, becauſe they have forſaken the covenant of the Lord, &amp;c. Apoſtates diſgrace the Religion and profeſſion whence they fall, offend the faithfull Profeſſours thereof, grieve the good Spirit of God, and open the mouthes of the enemies of the Goſpell againſt their Profeſſion, and ſo give great cauſe of wrath. Yea, departing away from God, who is the Lord of life, they cannot have ſalvation.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 46. Of the cauſes of Gods wrath among us.
                     THat it may appeare what juſt cauſe the Lord hath to powre out the vials of his wrath among us, it wilbe a ſeaſonable taske to take a view of our owne times, and to obſerve whether the forenamed ſinnes may be found among us. For too too truly it may now be ſaid of this Land, of this City, There is wrath gone out from the Lord, the Plague is begun.
                     
                     In proſecuting this taske I will follow the order before Sinnes provoking Gods anger riſe among us. As, 1. Idolatry. propounded; and bring thoſe ſinnes which have been proved formerly to have provoked Gods wrath, to our times.
                     1. For idolatry, though the bright light of the Goſpell hath for Since the 17 of Nov. 1558. many yeares diſpelled the thicke cloud of Popery, a deteſtable idolatry: yet in many places that cloud gathereth, and thickneth againe. I pray God it increaſe not as 1 Kin. 18. 44. that cloud which Eliahs ſervant eſpied: which though at firſt it were but a little one like a mans hand, yet it grew to cover the whole skie, and to cauſe much raine. Too many ſeducers are among us: too great countenance is given to them. We Miniſters have need to inculcate this Apoſtolicall prohibition, 1 Cor. 10. 14. 
                        Flee from idolatry.
                     
                     2. For prophanation of holy things and times, he is blind 2. Proſanation that diſcerneth it not: he himſelfe is too prophane, that is not in his righteous ſoule vexed thereat. Prayer, preaching, Sacraments are altogether neglected, or very careleſly, obſerved. As for the Lords Day, it is in many places by many Perſons made the Devils day. It is not only in act prophaned, but the profanation therof too much countenanced, juſtified.
                     3. For Pollution of profeſſion, what advantage is thereby 3. Pollution of Profeſſion. given to our adverſaries. Thence they take occaſion of upbraiding to us our reformation. Yea, the prophane among us are hereby juſtified. For many Profeſſours are every way as lewde and licentious as they: as vaine in their attire, as corrupt in their ſpeeches, as wanton in their geſture, as deceitfull in their dealing, as uncharitable

in their cenſures, as unmercifull to the poore, &amp;c.
                     4. For ungratefull vilifying Gods mercies, I thinke our 4. Ingratitude. people exceed therein the Iſraelites that dwelt in the wilderneſſe. Heavenly Manna, the Word of life, that plentifully falleth among us, is by ſuperſtitious, ſchiſmaticall, and prophane perſons loathed. Superſtitious perſons wiſh for Queene Maries dayes againe. Schiſmatiques wiſh there had beene no reformation unleſſe it had beene better. The prophane cry out of too much preaching.
                     5. For Magiſtrates abuſing their authority, all the complaints 5. Magiſtrates abuſes. of the Prophets may too juſtly be taken up againſt many of ours, if at leaſt this were a fit place to make complaints of their bribe-taking, perverting juſtice, oppreſſing the innocent, uſing their power to their owne turnes, &amp;c.
                     6. For Miniſters perverting their function, many among 6. Miniſters faults. us exceed the falſe prophets among the Iewes. None greater diſcouragers of the upright. None greater animaters of the prophane. The greateſt zeale which they uſe to ſhew, is in their bitter invectives againſt ſuch as make moſt conſcience of ſinne. They are too great companions with the baſeer and lewder ſort.
                     7. For trampling upon ſuch as are fallen, ſo inhumane are 7. In humanity Am 6. 6. many, as they do not onely ſtretch themſelves upon their beds, and drinke wine in bowles, while their brethren 
                           •
                        e groaning under ſore afflictions: or (like the Prieſt and Levite) paſſe by without ſuccouring ſuch as are not able to helpe themſelves: Luk. 10 31, 32. Iob 4 6. Luk. 1. 1. 2 Sam. 16. 7, 8 but like Iobs friends charge them with hypocriſie, or like the Iewes account them the greateſt ſinners, or as Shemei, raile on them: and ſo give them (inſtead of a cup of conſolation) vinegar and gall to drinke.
                     8. For conſpiracy and conſent in ſin, when was there more, 8. Conſpiracy then among us. Great ones, meane ones, old, young, male, female, Magiſtrates, ſubjects, Miniſters, people, rich, poore, maſters, ſervants, all of one mind to diſgrace integrity and to countenance impiety and iniquity. Inſomuch as the Prophets complaint is too truly verified among us, Iſa. 59. 15.
                        He that refraineth from evill maketh himſelfe a prey.
                     
                     
                        
9. For obstinacy in ſinne, who can open his mouth wide 9. Obſtinacy. enough againſt mens ſtubborneneſſe. They are impudent and ſtiffe-necked. They have a whores forehead and will not be 
                        Ezek. 2. 4. Ier. 3. 3. 
                        aſhamed. They bid a kind of defiance to God himſelfe. As they abuſe his mercies, ſo they deſpiſe his judgements. What ſwearer, what blaſphemer, what drunkard, what adulterer, what fornicatour, what oppreſſour, what extortioner, what uſurer, what deceiver is reformed by this Plague? So obſtinate are people, as God had need to make the faces of his Miniſters ſtrong against their foreheads. 
                        Ezek. 3 8, 9.
                     
                     10. For Infidelity, we Miniſters have too great cauſe to cry out, Who hath believed our report? Were not this ſinne 10. Infidelity, Iſa. 53. 1. ſo faſt fixed in mens hearts as it is, much more comfort would be received from the Miniſtry of the Goſpell, and much better obedience yeelded thereto. The Apoſtle giveth this reaſon of the ſmall profit that was reaped by the Goſpell, It was not mixed with faith in them that heard it. True faith hath a double worke where it is kindly wrought. Heb 4 2. Faiths double worke. 1. In generall, it perſwadeth the heart of the truth of Gods Word. 2. In particular, it brings the heart to apply that truth to it ſelfe, as a truth which concernes him. The ſmall profit that many reape by Gods Word, the little uſe that they make thereof, ſheweth how infidelity beareth ſway in them. Thus it commeth to paſſe that they are like the children in the market, that neither danced to them that piped, nor lamented with them that mourned. Nor promiſes, nor Mat 11. 16, 17. threatnings, nor mercies, nor judgements worke upon them.
                     11. For impenitency, It cannot be denied but that many, yea moſt, are ſo ſetled on their ſins, as they hate to be reformed. 11. Impenitency. Where are true fruits of repentance to be found? Where ſhame, where ſorrow for ſin? Where turning from ſin? Men rather grow worſe and worſe. Gods judgments harden their

If by any occaſion their conſciences be any whit rub'd, and they brought thorow feare and anguiſh to promiſe amendment, they quickly ſhew that no

true repentance was wrought in them: But it is hapned unto them according to the true proverbe, The dog is turned to his

                     12. For Apostaſie, if firſt we conſider inward apoſtaſie 12. Apoſtaſie. Inward. (which is Rev. 2. 4, 5. 2 Theſ. 2. 10. 11. a decaying inwardly in former love of truth) too great and juſt cauſe of complaining is given. Many have left their firſt love, and become Rev. 3. 16. Outward Apoſtaſie. 
                        lukewarme, as the Laodiceans. Thus a ready way is made to outward apoſtaſie: which is an open renouncing of the very profeſſion of true Religion, as this whole land did in Queene Maries raigne. It is much to be feared, that if a like occaſion ſhould be given, a like apoſtaſie would follow.
                     If theſe, and other like provocations of Gods wrath among us be duly weighed, we ſhall ſee cauſe enough to confeſſe that Gods wrath is juſtly gone out againſt us, and that we have deſervedly pulled this Plague upon our owne pates.
                     It remaines therefore that we thorowly humble our ſelves: that we lay open our ſoares before our mercifull God: that we faithfully promiſe amendment: that we give evidence of the intire purpoſe of our heart in promiſing, by an anſwerable performance. But above all, for the preſent, that we crave mercy and pardon of God thorow Ieſus Chriſt, that he may offer up his ſweet incenſe to pacifie his Father, and cauſe his deſtroying Angell, to ſtay his hand.
                  
                  
                     §. 47. Of the kind of plague here meant.
                     THe Effect of the fore-mentioned wrath that came from the Lord, is thus expreſſed, THE PLAGVE IS BEGVN.
                     The word tranſlated,

                        plague is a generall word, that ſignifieth any heavy ſtroake of God. The roote whence it is derived ſignifieth to ſtrike. Exo. 21. 35. It is applied to an oxes ſtriking, or puſhing to death, ſo to other like ſtrikings: but

moſt commonly to Gods ſtriking of wicked men with ſome extraordinary judgement. As where David ſaid of Saul,

                        The Lord ſhall ſmite him: meaning ſo as to deſtroy him. This word is Exo. 8. 2.—12. 23.—12. 27. Ioſ. 24. 5. oft uſed of Gods ſmiting the Egyptians when they held the Iſraelites among them as bond-ſlaves. Yea, ſuch a word as Exo. 9. 14.

                         the word in my text is uſed to ſet out all thoſe judgements which God brought upon the Egyptians, called plagues. The word PLAGVE in our vulgar acception importeth an infectious mortall diſeaſe, otherwiſe ſtiled peſtilence. Our Engliſh word, plague, ſeemeth to be taken from the Plaga.

                           plaga. Deut. 28. 59. other words to ſet out that diſeaſe which we commonly call the plague: and that as generall as this, properly ſignifying ſtroakes, and ſcourgings: ſo as they all imply that a plague is an extraordinary ſtroake, or ſcourge of God. Yet there is in Hebrew

                           cum duplici ſegol.
                         a word that is more properly put for the plague: which our Engliſh doth commonly tranſlate peſtilence. It is the word that God uſed, when he offered to David the choice of one of theſe three judgements, Sword, Famine, Peſtilence.

                           peſtis, quia multi caaem evertuntur.
                         The roote from whence this word is derived ſignifieth to overthrow, or deſtroy. And experience ſheweth that by the plague many are deſtroyed. 
                           Sic Latinè peſtis, quia peſſundat.
                         In Latine peſtis importeth as much, whence the Scots call this ſickneſſe the pest.

                            deſicio Quia facit defectum. The Greeke word alſo intendeth the like. This latter word pestilence, is more reſtrained to one kind of diſeaſe, then the former tranſlated plague. Every peſtilence is a plague, becauſe it is an extraordinary ſtroak and judgement of God. But every plague is not a peſtilence: for all the plagues of Egypt were not peſtilences.
                     As for the plague here mentioned, though it be not expreſſed under

                         that word which properly ſignifieth peſtilence: yet was it queſtionleſſe a peſtilence. For,
                           1. 2 Sam. 24. 21, 25. 
                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                 
                               Such a word as this is attributed to the peſtilence
                              
that in Davids time deſtroyed 70000 within the ſpace of three dayes.
                           2. It was infectious: which was one reaſon why Numb. 16. 48 
                              Aaron ſtood betwixt the dead and the living: that he might keepe the living from being infected by the dead.
                           3. It was extraordinarily mortall. For Numb. 16. 49. in a ſhort ſpace there died of it 14700.
                        
                     
                     
                        Queſt. If ſo many died, how is it ſaid, that the plague is begun?
                     
                     
                        Anſw. In the very beginning of the plague, on a ſudden, ſo many were deſtroyed, even as at once. Thus in a very ſhort time, on a ſudden there were found 185000 dead in the Campe of the Aſſyrians, lying in ſiege againſt Ieruſalem.
                     In theſe words, The plague is begun, is an effect of Gods wrath.
                     
                     More particularly we may obſerve

                     Hence ariſe two obſervations.
                           I. A plague is an evidence of Gods wrath.
                           
                           II. God can make the beginning of a judgement terrible.
                           
                        The connexion of theſe two clauſes, There is wrath gone out from the Lord, The plague is begun, give proofe of the former.
                     This intimation of the beginning of the plague, Aarons ſpeed in offering incenſe, the vertue of that ſpeed, that the plague was ſtayed, and yet 14700 to be dead, gives evidence to the latter obſervation.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 48. Of a plague as an effect of Gods wrath.
                     I. See §. 47. Indignationem Dei peſtilentia ſubſequitur. Hieron. Comment. in Iſay. lib. 4. cap. 19. A Plague is an evidence of Gods wrath. The plague which upon Davids numbring the people was inflicted on Iſrael, is expreſly noted to be an effect of Gods wrath. For firſt it is ſaid, for demonſtration of the cauſe of that judgement, that 2 Sam. 24. 1. 
                        The anger of the Lord was kindled against Iſrael: and againe that 1 Chro. 21. 7. 
                        God was diſpleaſed with Davids numbring the people, and Therefore he ſmote Iſrael. 
                        Deu. 32. 22, 23. Where God ſaith, Fire is kindled in my wrath, he addeth as an effect thereof, I will ſend plagues among them. 
                        Ezek. 5. 16, 17 There are three arrowes of Gods wrath mentioned in Scripture; and the plague is one of theſe. The other two are ſword and famine.
                     
                     Generall and extraordinary judgements are ſuch as alway come from the wrath of God. Inſtance the judgements which were inflicted on the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe. They were generall, as in handling the next doctrine we ſhall ſhew: and extraordinary, as the ſeverall kinds of them do ſhew. And they are oft noted to come from the wrath of the Lord, Numb. 11. 1. 
                        The Lords anger was kindled, and the fire of the Lord burnt among them, and conſumed them. 
                        —33. 
                        The wrath of the Lord was kindled againſt the people, and the Lord ſmote the people with a very great plague. 
                        —25. 4. 
                        The anger of the Lord was kindled againſt Iſrael: and the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, take all the heads of the people, and hang them up, &amp;c. But not to inſiſt on more particulars, the Pſalmist rendreth this as a generall cauſe of all the judgements that were inflicted on them, Pſal. 106. 40. A plague is generall and extraordinary. 
                        The wrath of the Lord was kindled againſt his people, inſomuch that he abhorred his owne inheritance. Now experience ſheweth that a plague is both a generall and an extraordinary judgement. Generall it is, for it uſeth to ſpread farre and neare, from perſon to perſon, from houſe to houſe, from ſtreet to ſtreet, from towne to towne, from city to city: and it taketh away all of all ſorts, young, old, male, female, weake, ſtrong, meane ones, great ones, &amp;c. Extraordinary

it is, becauſe the immediate hand of God in ſending it, in increaſing it, in leſſening it, in taking it away, is more conſpicuouſly diſcerned then in other judgements. It is obſervable to this purpoſe, that when David choſe the plague, he thus expreſſeth his mind, 2 Sam. 24. 14.
                        Let us fall now into the hand of the Lord.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 49. Of afflictions as effects of wrath or love.
                     
                        Queſt. ARe not diſeaſes, and other kinds of judgements ſomtimes ſent for triall, and for other like ends, which are demonſtrations of the wiſdome, love, and care of God towards his people, as well as in wrath and vengeance to deſtroy them.

                           3. Betwixt the perſons on whom calamities are brought, being of different diſpoſitions though they be mixed together in the ſame place for co-habition.
                           4. Betwixt the cauſe of a judgement, and the effect and fruit of it.
                        
                     
                     1. Particular and private afflictions are oft in love, by reaſon of Gods wiſe and tender care over his children, inflicted on them. Heb. 12. 6. 
                        For whom the Lord loveth he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth every ſonne whom he receiveth. And 
                        —10. See the profitable ends of afflictions in The whole armour of God, on Eph. 6. 11. §. 2. &amp; Eph. 6. 15. §. 13. 
                        God chasteneth us for our profit. But we read not of any publike and generall judgement, which came not from the wrath of God. Many inſtances of the affirmative, that they were effects of wrath, were given before: and the Scripture affoordeth many more: but not one to the contrary.
                     2. There are common calamities that fall on all of all ſorts: and there are other more ſpeciall, that are intended onely againſt profeſſours of the true Religion: as perſecutions made by enemies of the Goſpell. 1 Pet. 4. 12, 13 Theſe may be for triall, to their honour that ſuffer. But a plague is not of that kind.
                     
                        
3. When publike and generall judgements come from wrath againſt ſinfull nations, cities, and other ſocieties, there may be ſome righteous ones mixed among thoſe wicked ones: and by reaſon of that mixture they may taſte of the bitterneſſe of that cup that is given to the wicked to drinke. Yet the Lord can ſo ſanctifie that See §. 15. Sive famen, ſive bellum, ſive aliud quodcun
                                 
                                    
                                 
                                 que
                               moleſtum inducat Deus, ex benignitate, &amp; multa dilectione hoc efficit Chryſ ad Pop Hom. 7. common judgement to the Saints that partake thereof, as that which is an effect of wrath to others, may be a fruit of Gods love to them. Thus a plague may be ſent in wrath againſt a ſociety, and yet therein Gods love be manifeſted to his Saints, either in preſerving them from it, or taking them by it to heaven. In relation to ſuch perſons we may truly ſay, that whether God ſend famine, or war, or any other trouble, he doth it of his goodneſſe and love.
                     4. A judgement may at firſt be in wrath inflicted: and yet upon the ſenſe of the ſmart thereof people may be ſo humbled, and brought to ſuch repentance, as the nature of that judgement be altered, and prove to be an evidence of Gods love. Yea ſuch reformation may be wrought thereby, as that calamity (though generall and extraordinary) prove very profitable, and an evidence of Gods fatherly care over ſuch a people whom he hath ſo purged. 2 Chro. 33. 11, &amp;c. Inſtance that fearefull judgement that was laid on Iſrael in Manaſſehs  time. This latter fruit of Gods love maketh not againſt the former evidence of his wrath. For on ſuch occaſions God is ſaid to repent him of the evill which he hath ſent. He was angry: but his anger is turned into favour.
                     The concluſion then remaineth true, that a plague (as firſt ſent to a people) is an evidence of Gods wrath.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 50. Of the duties to be done when a plague is begun.
                     A Plague being an effect of Gods wrath, for ſtaying the plague meanes for pacifying Gods wrath muſt be uſed. So did David. He humbled himſelfe, confeſſed his ſinne, and that with a penitent heart, and offered ſacrifice to God. Apply to this judgement of a plague the directions § 4, 5, 6, 10. before given. And becauſe Moſes giveth here a direction when this plague begun, be carefull betimes, even at the beginning of a plague to ſeeke to aſſwage Gods anger. Hereof alſo § 30. before. And that ye may be the more conſcionable herein, know that plagues come not by chance, come not by any ordinary courſe and meanes. They come from Gods wrath. Let the directions therefore before given for pacifying Gods wrath be rather obſerved, then any phyſicall directions. I denie not but that they are lawfull, needfull, uſefull. But this which I ſpeake of, is more lawfull, needfull, and uſefull. All other without this is nothing at all. In all diſeaſes Gods helpe is eſpecially to be ſought. It was Aſa his fault, that 2 Chro. 16. 12 
                        In his diſeaſe he ſought not to the Lord, but to the Phyſitians. If in all diſeaſes, moſt of all in this that is ſuch an immediate effect of Gods wrath, The Lord is to be ſought unto. And ſo much the rather, becauſe the plague (among other evidences of Gods wrath) is a moſt fearefull one, as §. 71. 72. hereafter is ſhewed.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 51. Of the terrour of the beginning of Gods judgements.
                     II. See § 47. 
                        GOD can make the beginning of a judgement terrible. I denie not but that the Lord doth oft times begin very mildly and gently: as he dealt with the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe, bringing them Exo 15. 23. to bitter waters, making them to feele —16. 3. the want of bread, and —17. 1. 
                        water, (not ſtarving them) and Deut. 25. 18. ſuffering Amalek to ſmite the hindmoſt of them: to try if they would learne to cleave cloſe vnto the Lord. But afterwards his ſtroaks were more heavy upon them. Yet he can, and oft doth make the beginning of his judgements very terrible. At the firſt raiſing of the floud to drowne the world, Gen. 7. 11. 
                        All the fountaines of the great deepe were broken up, and the windowes of heaven. Was it not a terrible ſight to behold the waters fall downe from heaven, and riſe up out of the earth ſo faſt as they did? Immediately upon the Gen. 19. 23, 24. 
                        Sunnes riſing on the earth, the Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah brimſtone and fire from the Lord out of heaven. How fearefull a ſpectacle was that even at the firſt ſight thereof. The Egyptian plagues give alſo evidence hereof. So doth the drowning of Pharaoh and his hoſte in the red ſea. For while they confidently purſued the Iſraelites, ſuppoſing to get over as ſafe as the Exo. 14. 24, 25 
                        Iſraelites did, on a ſudden The hoſte of the Egyptians was troubled, and their chariot wheeles taken off. In a word, ſtormes ſo aroſe, and waters ſo fell upon them, as they were all ſoone drowned. Such were many of Gods judgements in the wilderneſſe. Such 2 King. 19. 35 the deſtruction of the Campe of the Aſſyrians: Such Luke 13. 1, 4 their death Whoſe bloud Pilate mingled with their ſacrifices, and theirs on whom the tower of Siloe fell: and Act. 12. 23. 
                        Herods; and many other like judgements.
                     Gods almighty power makes his judgements to be very terrible. His infinite wiſdome makes him know when it is fit, at the firſt, and in the beginning, to manifeſt his terrour: anſwerably he doth ſo. For in wiſdome he ordereth all his

actions: and that ſo as may moſt make to the glory of his name. Herein Eph. 3. 10. his wiſdome is manifeſted to be manifold, in that he can ſometimes by degrees encreaſing his judgements, and ſometimes by powring them out at once bring greateſt glory to his name. For by the former kinde of proceeding with men, he giveth evidence of his patience and long-ſuffering, in that though he be provoked to powre out the vials of his anger, yet he is ſlow to wrath, and would not that men ſhould periſh in his anger, but rather by the beginning of it, be brought to repentance. By the latter kinde, he giveth inſtance of his terrour when he hath to do with obdurate, and obſtinate ſinners.
                     Having to do with ſuch a God, as can make even the beginning of his judgement ſo terrible, how watchfull ought we to be, that we provoke him not at once to powre out the vials of his wrath againſt us? This ſeverity is uſually executed after contempt of milder proceedings (as hath been §. 22. before proved) or upon the committing of grievous ſinnes that cry up to heaven for vengeance, as the ſins of Gen. 18. 20. 
                        Sodom did: or upon obdurate and obſtinate perſons that Pſal. 50. 17, 22 
                        hate inſtruction. So as men themſelves are the cauſe that Gods ſtroakes are ſo heavy. If a Lion that at firſt teares all to peeces, if a flaming fire that quickly turnes all to aſhes, if a raging ſtorme that ſoone overſets ſhip with all that's in it, if other like violent evils that affoord no time of ſeeking helpe and remedy be much feared: ſhould not the violent terrour of the Lord be much more feared?
                     The inference of the beginning of the plague upon the direction to make an attonement: and that as an enforcement of the reaſon (as hath beene ſhewed before, §. 40.) affoords this Doctrine. Gods wrath in the beginning of a judgement is to be pacified. But hereof we had occaſion to treat before. §. 32.

                           NVMB. 16. 47.And Aaron tooke as Moſes commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation: and behold the plague was begun among the people: and he put incenſe, and made an attonement for the people.
                     
                     THe fore-mentioned charge for ſtaying the plague is here noted to be put in execution: for it is expreſly ſaid, that Aaron tooke as Moſes commanded. That is, He tooke a cenſer, and put fire therein from off the altar; For theſe are the things which Moſes commanded in the former verſe. This word,

                        commanded is fitly tranſlated. For though uſually the word, in the firſt conjugation import no more then to ſpeake. Yet In Piel quae dadeſhatur. in the ſecond, an emphaſis is added by a doubled letter: and ſo, eſpecially if the Perſon that ſpake, Moſes, the Prince and chief Governour; and the Matter ſpoken, which was a Divine direction for ſtaying the plague, be duly weighed, it will appeare to have the force of a command.
                     As Aarons obedience in the generall ſubſtance is commended: ſo alſo in the particular circumſtances, which is implied in this particle

                     Beſides this generall, that Aaron tooke as Moſes commanded, ſome particulars are expreſſed: For where Moſes charged to go quickly, it is here ſaid that Aaron 
                        
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
                         
                        ràn, which importeth the greateſt ſpeed that man can make: for he hath not wings to fly withall. It is added,

                        Into the midſt of the congregation, namely where the plague was hotteſt, to ſhew that feare of infection kept not him from executing his function.
                     And where this reaſon is rendred by Moſes (The plague is begun) to move Aaron to make ſpeed, the ſame reaſon is here againe repeated, and

it (Behold the plague is begun among the people) to ſhew that he was the rather thereby ſtirred to make the ſpeed he made, and to do the deed he did.
                     Where further Moſes commanded to put incenſe on the fire that Aaron tooke from the altar in his cenſer, it is here ſaid that He put incenſe.
                     
                     And to ſhew Gods approbation and acceptation of that which Aaron ſo did according to the charge given him, where Moſes ſaid Make an attonement for them, to give Aaron to underſtand the reaſon of the charge he gave him: it is here ſaid, He made an attonement for the people: Declaring thereby that the end which Moſes aimed at was accompliſhed.

                     Five uſefull inſtructions (beſides thoſe which were noted in the charge on the 46 Verſe, whereof many of them might be here noted againe) are here offered to our due conſideration.
                     
                        
                        I. Obedience is to be yeelded to the good directions of pious Governours. Moſes was a pious Governour: his direction was a very good one. Aaron yeelded obedience thereto: which is here commended, and recorded as a patterne for us to follow.
                        II. Obedience is to be ordered according to the charge given. Not onely in the generall ſubſtance, but alſo in the particular circumſtances. This particle 
                              
                                 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                              
                            
                           AS importeth as much. So do the particular branches of Aarons obedience, being anſwerable to the particulars of Moſes his charge.
                        III. Haſte muſt be made to relieve ſuch as are in distreſſe. When Aaron heares that a plague was among the people, he runnes to ſuccour them.
                        IIII. A good calling may make one bold in danger. Aaron was a Prieſt, and by vertue thereof to offer for the people. He was commanded of Moſes to go to the congregation: Therefore he is bold to run into the midst of the congregation, where the plague was begun.
                        
                        V. Gods judgements are duely to be obſerved. The note of obſervation, BEHOLD, imports as much.

                        OBedience is to be yeelded to the good directions of pious Governours. I ſay good, ſuch as are lawfull and warrantable, becauſe ſuch an one was the direction here given by Moſes, and becauſe if mens directions or commandements be evill, ſuch as 1 Sam. 22. 17. 
                        Sauls was unto his ſervants to ſlay the Prieſts of the Lord, and as Act 4. 18. the Rulers was unto the Apoſtles, not to ſpeake at all, nor to teach in the name of Ieſus, then this Apoſtolicall rule takes place, Acts 5. 29. 
                        We ought to obey Godrather then men. Where further this attribute, pious, is inſerted, it is not to exclude other Governours, as if the commandements or directions of none but pious Governours were to be obeyed. For Rom. 13. 1. &amp;c Eph. 6. 5. 1 Tim 6. 1. Tit. 2. 9—3. 1. the Apoſtles, that wrote to Chriſtian

ſubjects and ſervants that were under Heathen Governours 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14, 18.—3. 1. and Maſters, exhorted to obey ſuch, namely in the Lord, ſo farre forth as they obey not in things forbidden by God, or any way againſt his will. (

Yet where Governours are pious, obedience ought ſo much the rather to be yeelded to them: as the Apoſtle adviſeth, where he ſaith, 1 Tim. 6. 2. 
                        They that have believing maſters, let them the rather do them ſervice, becauſe they are faithfull. Such an one was Moſes, to whoſe charge Aaron here yeelded obedience. And therefore this attribute, pious, is here inſerted. Of this generall point I have treated in The Churches Conqueſt, on Exo. 17. 10. §. 36.

                        OBedience is to be yeelded according to the charge given. In ſuch charges as God giveth, or by faithfull Miniſters are given from God, this holdeth good without any limitation. In charges given by men it muſt be limited and reſtrained by ſuch circumſtances as are not againſt God and his Word.
                     For the former kind of charges and directions which are Divine, theſe phraſes of Deut. 5. 32.—17. 20.—28. 14. Ioſ. 1. 7.—23. 6. Pro. 4. 27. 
                        Not turning to the right hand or the left: of Num. 22. 18. 
                        not going beyond the word of the Lord to do leſſe or more, or —24. 13. 
                        to do good or bad of ones owne mind, imply a preciſe cleaving, and cloſe holding to Gods Word, ſo as we ſwarve from it in nothing, no not in circumſtances. That firſt phraſe of not turning to the right hand or to the left, implieth that Gods Word is as a right way wherein onely we muſt walke to attaine unto happineſſe: and that being in that way, we may not turne out of it on any ſide, any whither. The phraſe is uſed in that promiſe which the Iſraelites made to Edom when they deſired to paſſe thorow his land. Numb. 20 17. 
                        Let us paſſe (ſay they) thorow thy country: we will not paſſe thorow the fields or thorow the vineyards, neitherwill
                        
                        we drinke of the water of the wells: we will go by the Kings high way: we will not turne to the right hand nor to the left, untill we have paſſed thy borders. They hereby profeſſe to keepe themſelves onely in the high-way: and not at any time any where to ſtep out of it, no not with mind of returning into it againe. Thus it imports that it is not enough in ſome things to follow Gods direction, and ſo to walke in his way: and in other things to ſwerve from his direction, and ſo to walke out of it; but in all things we muſt follow it. Yea though there be occaſions of ſundry ſorts, ſome enticing us one way, others another way, ſome to the right hand, ſome to the left, ſome more faire in ſhew then others, yet ought we not to yeeld to any of them. This charge given to Moſes (Exo 25. 40 
                        Looke that thou make them after their patterne, which was ſhewed thee in the mount) hath reſpect not only to the generall matter and ſubſtance, but alſo to particular manner and circumſtances. So do all thoſe Epithites which in Divine directions and commandements are uſed to ſet out the manner of performing things required.
                     
                        Ioſiah did herein teſtifie his reſpect to God and his Word, 2 King. 22. 2. 
                        He did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, and turned not aſide to the right hand or to the left: which is —23. 25. afterward thus more fully expreſſed, He turned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his ſoule, and with all his might, according to all the Law of Moſes.
                     
                     For directions and charges which men that are in authority over us, do give, the forementioned phraſe is applied to them. Where God appointed Iudges over his people to decide matters of controverſie, he ordained that his people ſhould do Deut. 17. 11. 
                        according to the judgement of thoſe Iudges, and not decline from the ſentence which they ſhould ſhew, to the right hand or to the left. 
                        Ioſ. 1. 17. The Iſraelites profeſſe that they had hearkened unto Moſes in all things: and promiſe ſo to hearken unto Ioſhua.
                     
                     To yeeld ſuch obedience to Gods charge, in the matter and manner, in the ſubſtance and circumſtances thereof, is a reall acknowledgement, not of his Soveraignty onely, and

power to command, but of his wiſdome alſo in ordering of his commands ſo as good heed is to be given to every circumſtance thereof: not one, no not the leaſt of them being in vaine.
                     This alſo manifeſteth a very dutifull reſpect to God, to be conſcionable in performing whatſoever he manifeſteth to be 
                           Ne tractemus quare Deus unumquod

It ſhewes that we humbly can ſubmit our thoughts to the counſell of God, when we queſtion not his charge, but readily do whatſoever is commanded.
                     Such a ſubjection to our Governours is an outward demonſtration of the reſpect we beare to that place wherein God hath ſet them over us, and to that authority which he hath given them. They that obey onely in ſuch things as themſelves thinke ſubſtantiall and weighty, may ſeeme to obey rather for the matter, then for authority ſake: and they that neglect or refuſe to obſerve the circumſtances given in charge, ſhew that they thinke themſelves wiſer then their Governours; and better know how to diſtinguiſh betwixt needfull, and not-needfull matters, then their Governours; which favoureth too rankely of pride and preſumption.
                  
                  
                     §. 55. Of the danger of ſcanty obedience.
                     1. MAny mens obedience is hereby diſcovered to be very ſcanty and faulty, eſpecially in relation to Divine directions and commandements: even the obedience of ſuch as think highly of that they have done. Inſtance Sauls obedience. He, it ſeemes, was well conceited of his obedience, when he met Samuel with this congratulation, 1 Sam. 15. 13. 
                        Bleſſed be thou of the Lord: I have performed the comman dement of the Lord. Yet Samuel challengeth him of —19. 
                        diſobedience, and of —23. 
                        rebellion. Saul performed the —3. ſubſtance of Gods charge: for he —7. 
                        ſmote the Amalakites. But he failed in the —3. extent of that charge, he did not utterly deſtroy all that they had: he —15. 
                        ſpared the beſt of the ſheepe and of the
                        
                        oxen. This tooke away the glory, comfort, and benefit of his generall obedience. His reward was the reward of rebellion. 1 Sam. 15. 23. It coſt him his kingdome. Gods indignation againſt failing in ſuch things as fooliſh man may count circumſtances, is manifeſted in the example of that 1 King. 13. 1, &amp;c. 
                        Man of God which was ſent to Ieroboam. He faithfully delivered his whole meſſage: and though the King invited him to tarry and refreſh himſelfe, yet he would not, becauſe the Lord had forbidden him ſo to do. Yet becauſe afterwards he believed another Prophet againſt that part of Gods charge, and went back with him to eat and to drink in his houſe, it coſt him his life: a Lion met him, and ſlew him.
                     Both the ſubſtance and circumſtances of a charge are grounded on the ſame authority. To faile in either of them is to tranſgreſſe his will that enjoyned the one as well as the other. No marvell then that the doing of one be blemiſhed by omitting the other.

IT behoveth us wiſely and heedfully to take due and diligent notice of every charge that is given us in charge, of the particular branches thereof, and of all the circumſtances appertaining thereto, that by a conſcionable obſervation of them all, we may ſhew our ſelves Heb. 3. 2. 
                        faithfull to him that hath appointed us, as God ſaith of Moſes: 
                        Numb. 12. 7. 
                        He was faithfull in all mine houſe. This is honourable to him that giveth the charge, to be in every part and particle thereof obeyed. This therefore will alſo be acceptable to him. In which reſpects it cannot but be very comfortable and advantageable to the party himſelfe that performeth the obedience. This was it wherewith Hezekiah comforted himſelfe on his ſicke Iſa 38. 3. bed: and whereby he was emboldened to call upon God even to reverſe that ſentence of death which he had given out againſt him. For the perfect heart which he mentioned in his prayer, was that impartiall reſpect which he had to

every thing given him in charge by the Lord. A perfect heart in Scripture phraſe is an entire heart, or the whole heart. And that heart which hath reſpect to the whole will of God, ſo farre as it is made knowne unto him, is moſt properly the whole heart. If any object that a perfect heart implieth a ſincere heart: I anſwer, that an eſpeciall point of ſincerity conſiſteth in the fore-ſaid intireneſſe.

                        Abraham heard that his brother Lot was taken by the enemies, he quickly gathered an army together before the enemy could eſcape, and not tarying for day light, marched by night. It appeareth that 1 Sam. 11. 11. 
                        Saul did ſo for the ſuccour of Iabeſh Gilead. For he came into the middeſt of the hoste of the enemies in the morning watch: ſo as he muſt needs march in the night time.

                     Thus will ſuccour intended come the more ſeaſonably: thus may it be the more profitable and beneficiall. By making haſte much danger (which delaying and putting off helpe cauſeth) is oft prevented. This both Martha and Ioh 11. 21. 32. 
                        Mary intended, when they ſaid to Ieſus, Lord if thou hadst beene here my brother had not died. If Chriſt could only have healed the ſick, and not alſo have raiſed the dead, that which they ſaid had beene to purpoſe.

                     1. GReat is the inhumanity of them that put off opportunities of affoording ſuccour to ſuch as are in diſtreſſe. It is directly againſt the rule of charity, that is ſo affected with a brothers miſery, as it will not ſuffer him to lie therein a moment beyond the time that it is able to releaſe him. The wiſe-man expreſly forbiddeth all delay in ſhewing mercy, ſaying, Say not to thy neighbour, Goe, and come againe, and to morrow I will give: when thou hast it by 
                        Pro. 3. 28. 
                        thee. Good purpoſes are oft times brought to nought by ſuch delayes. For at firſt ſight, or other knowledge of ones miſery the bowels of another are moved, and thereat he purpoſeth to affoord him that is in miſery the beſt helpe he can. But by putting it off for that preſent, his compaſſion is cooled, and his purpoſe thereupon altered, and ſo no ſuccour affoorded. Yea by delaying helpe, though the purpoſe of doing ones beſt for helpe remaine, helpe may come too late: as a pardon when the malefactour is hang'd, and a medicine when the patient is paſt recovery. To this purpoſe tends

                        Moſes by vertue of his ſpeciall calling boldly oppoſed himſelfe againſt Pharaoh, 
                        Heb. 11. 27. 
                        Not fearing the wrath of the King. Ioſhua by vertue of his calling undertooke a warre againſt many mighty nations and kingdomes. So did many of the Iudges. 1 Sam 17. 34. 
                        David on this ground ſet upon a Beare at one time, and on a Lion at another, and ſlew them both. Lev. 13. 2, &amp;c.—14. 36, &amp;c. A Priest by vertue of his calling readily and ſecurely admitted lepers to come to him, viewed them, touched them, and went into houſes infected with leproſie, to view where, or how farre the leproſie had ſpread it ſelfe: yet was the leproſie infectious.
                     A good calling is that way wherein God by his Divine A calling is a good warrant. providence ſetteth a man, and wherein he hath appointed him to walke. Pſal. 91. 11. 
                        In that way he hath given his Angels charge over him to keepe him. Where we have Heb. 1. 14. the Angels to miniſter for us: and to Pſal 34. 7. 
                        encampe round about us; what need we

feare? They will either keepe us ſafe from danger in this world. Or if it ſeeme good to God to take us out of this world, they will carie our ſoules into heaven, as Luk. 16. 22. they did the ſoule of Lazarus.
                     
                     For application of this point, it is requiſite that we be Who to abide in plague time. well inſtructed by Gods Word in the kind of our calling, whether it be lawfull and warrantable, or no. As for extraordinary callings, they muſt be warranted by an extraordinary ſpirit, which is rare, if at all, in theſe dayes. But ordinary callings have their expreſſe warrant in Gods Word. As the callings of Magiſtrates, Miniſters, Souldiers, Husbands and Wives, Parents and Children, Maſters and Servants, Nurſes, and Helpers in all kinds of neceſſities. Theſe may, theſe muſt in their place &amp; calling expoſe themſelves to danger, for performing the work which by vertue of their place belongeth unto them. Captains and Soldiers muſt ſtand againſt enemies though thereby they endanger their lives. Magiſtrates muſt abide in Cities and other places beſieged or infected with contagious diſeaſes, to ſee good order kept, to take order for ſupply of ſuch neceſſaries as are fit for all ſorts, though by abiding there, they be in danger. So Miniſters muſt abide in ſuch places, to inſtruct, direct, comfort, encourage the people under their charge. So husbands and wives being one fleſh, muſt have ſuch a tender reſpect each of other, as not to forſake one another for feare of infection, or other like danger. Servants alſo, Nurſes, and others that in ſuch caſes take upon them, or by publique authority are appointed to be helpers to ſuch as are infected with the plague, or any other contagious and infectious diſeaſe, are bound to attend ſuch perſons, and abide by them, yea though it be with danger of their owne lives. For it is neceſſary that ſuch perſons be looked unto. To forſake and leave them, that are not able to helpe themſelves, to themſelves, is more then barbarous inhumanity. It is neceſſary that ſome abide by them. Who more bound then they that have an eſpeciall calling thereto? They with greateſt confidence may depend on Gods ſpeciall providence for protection

from infection. If they be infected and die, they with greateſt comfort may yeeld up their ſoules into Gods hands, as dying in that place wherein God hath ſet them. In theſe caſes God hath called them to venter their lives for their brethren, and thereby to give evidence of their true brotherly love.
                     Of old, Chriſtians were ſo charitable in relieving ſuch as were viſited with the plague, as willingly they hazarded their owne lives. For proofe whereof I will here ſet downe what Dionyſius Biſhop of Alexandria reporteth in an Epiſtle to the Brethren in Egypt. Euſeb. Eccl. Hiſt. lib. 7. c. 21. The charity of ancient Chriſtians to their brethren viſited with the plague.
                     
                     
                        Many of our brethren, by reaſon of their great love, and brotherly charity ſparing not themſelves, cleaved one to another, viſited the ſicke of the plague, and attended upon them diligently, cured them in Chriſt, which cost them their lives. And being full of other mens maladies, tooke the infection of their neighbours, and tranſlated of their owne accord the ſorrowes of others upon themſelves: fulfilling indeed the common ſaying, that Friendſhip is alwayes to be retained, and departing this life, they ſeemed the off-ſcowring of others. In this ſort the beſt of our brethren departed this life, whereof ſome were Ministers, ſome Deacons in great reverence amongſt the common people: So that this kind of Death for their great piety and ſtrength of faith, may ſeeme to differ nothing from Martyrdome. For they tooke the dead bodies of the Saints, whoſe breasts and hands, and faces lay upwards, and cloſed their eyes, ſhut their mouthes, and joyntly with one accord, being like affectioned, imbraced them, waſhed them, and prepared their funerals, and a little while after they enjoyed the like themſelves. For the living continually traced the ſteps of the dead. But among the Heathen all fell out on the contrary. For ſcarce had 
                        Heathens inhumanity in plague times. 
                        the Peſtilence taken place amongſt them, but they diverted themſelves, and fled from their moſt loving, and deareſt friends. They threw them halfe dead in the ſtreets. The dead they left unburied, to be devoured of Dogs: to the end they might avoid death, which they could not eſcape. Behold here the difference betwixt men that have faith, and faithleſſe men.

                        Anſw. I find no ground in ſacred Scripture to bind publique perſons to hazzard their life in particular mens caſes. They are ſet over a Society, not over one or two particular perſons. Indeed every particular member of the Society belongeth to their charge: and they ought to do what they can to the good of every particular perſon under their charge, ſo farre as may ſtand with the good of the whole body, and prove no prejudice thereto. But if by viſiting particular perſons they ſhould be infected, and by that infection their life taken away, would not this prove a prejudice and dammage to the whole body? Is it the way, is it the calling of a publique perſon to go into a particular mans houſe that is infected? Private perſons may every where be found out competently enabled to do ſuch duties as are requiſite to be done to ſuch as are viſited with the ſickneſſe: or at leaſt, fit perſons that have not publique imployments, may be choſen out, and ſet apart to viſit the ſicke in contagious places to comfort them, and to ſee all things meet for them, to be duly performed.

                        Anſw. Queſtionleſſe difference may be put betwixt perſons. Some Magiſtrates are of ſuch uſe in a common-wealth, as it is meet they be, as much as lyeth in man, preſerved

from danger. On this ground when David the King would have gone out with his ſouldiers to battell, The people anſwered, 
                        2 Sam. 18. 3. 
                        Thou ſhalt not go forth. Thou art worth ten thouſand of us. Wherefore eminent, excellent perſons may be exempted from abiding in dangerous places, and others ſubſtituted in their name and ſtead, to preſerve peace, keepe good order, and provide neceſſaries. Provided that they who are ſubſtituted be able and willing to performe the duties whereunto they be deputed. The like may be ſaid of Miniſters. Yea of husbands, parents, maſters, and the like: to leave a wife, a child, a ſervant infected with an infectious diſeaſe to the tendance of others that are fit and willing to do that duty, and faithfull in what they undertake, is not to forſake wife, child, or ſervant.

                        See The Churches Conqueſt on Exo. 17 14. §. 65. The many memorials which among the Iſraelites were made of Gods judgements, did imply a due conſideration of them.
                     
                        Pſal. 9. 16. Iſa. 26. 9. 
                        The Lord is knowne by executing judgement. His power, his juſtice, his hatred of evill, his jealouſie, his truth, his providence, and other his Divine attributes are evidently manifeſted in and by his judgements. By a due obſervation therefore of them, we have the more knowledge of God, and are brought the more to truſt in him, and to feare him, to be more carefull of pleaſing him, more heedfull in avoiding all things that may offend him. On this ground ſaith the Prophet, When thy judgements are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learne righteouſneſſe. 
                        Not heeding Gods judgements takes away the profit of them.
                     
                     Behold here one eſpeciall reaſon of the ſmall profit that is made of judgements which the Lord from time to time executeth

in the world, They are not regarded, but are paſſed over without any right obſervation of them. Pſal. 28. 5. Iſa. 5. 12.—57. 1. The Prophets much complaine hereof. It may be that men may take notice of judgements that fall upon their owne pates, at leaſt while they lie under them, and feele the waight or ſmart of them. But who almoſt conſiders, and layes to heart Gods judgements inflicted on others? Or judgements laid on himſelfe after they are removed or taken away? Mans egregious folly and ſervile diſpoſition is hereby manifeſted.
                     
                        His folly in omitting the opportunity of receiving warning by other mens harmes (as we ſpeake in the proverbe.) It is an avidence of Gods great indulgency to us, to puniſh others before our eyes: whereas he might juſtly puniſh us for example to others. It is an eſpeciall point of wiſdome, to make ſuch uſe thereof, as to be bettered thereby. But not to regard ſuch a providence, is notorious folly.
                     
                        His ſervile diſpoſition, in regarding ſtroaks no longer then they are laid upon him, and he feels the ſmart of them. Thus he provoketh God to deale with him as with a ſlave: and to adde ſtroake to ſtroake, judgement to judgement. Phr

                     Learne we to be more wiſe, more ingenuous. Let us apply the fore-mentioned point of conſidering Gods judgements All kinds of judgements to be duly obſerved. to all manner of judgements: whether inflicted on others, or on our ſelves: whether publique or private: whether immediately from Gods owne hands, or mediately from the hands of others, who are Gods inſtruments: whether ſudden or lingring judgements: whether temporall or ſpirituall: of what kind or ſort ſoever. Thus will light ariſe out of darkneſſe, meate out of the eater, comfort out of judgement, profit out of puniſhment. Thus are Gods judgements ſanctified: thus are Saints brought to ſay, and that by true experience, It is good for me that I have beene afflicted.

For he was to go to the congregation among whom the plague was begun. He was alſo to make an attonement: the attonement was not for the dead, but for the living. To ſhew that it was for the living, he ſtands betwixt the living and the dead: leaving the dead behind him: turning his face to the living; holding the incenſe before him, that the living might behold the ſmoke thereof aſcending to heaven for them. Herein he typified the true Of Chriſts interceſſion, See §. 38. and great High-Prieſt the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, our Mediatour, who ſtands betwixt us and the deſtroying wrath of God.
                     This phraſe betweene the living and the dead ſheweth that the dead fell among the living, ſo as the living were in great danger of death.
                     Hereupon it is inferred, that, the plague was ſtayed. The word tranſlated (ſtayed) properly ſignifieth to ſhut or hold

All theſe applications of the word do imply that the Lord by a ſtrong hand held this plague, which was as a devouring beaſt, deſirous to devoure more had more, that it ſhould do no more hurt.
                     We have here in this Verſe The efficacy of the meanes which Aaron uſed.
                     
                     Two points are particularly expreſſed.
                           
                              
1. The Manner of uſing the meanes. He ſtood betweene the dead and the living.
                           
                           2. The Effect thereof. The plague was ſtayed.
                           
                        
                     
                     The mention of the living, in the former part, for whoſe preſervation Aaron ſtood betweene them and the dead, giveth us to underſtand, that
                           I. Meanes is to be uſed for preſervation of the living.
                           
                        The mixture of the dead with the living, implied by Aarons care to ſtand betweene them, ſhewes that the living were in great hazzard of death, even in regard of humane meanes, in a deſperate caſe, and doth us further to wit, that
                           II. Meanes must be uſed in most deſperate diſtreſſes.
                           
                        The latter part which declareth the Effect of the meanes, as it hath relation to the meanes uſed, giveth inſtance, that
                           III. Warrantable meanes rightly uſed proove effectuall.
                           
                        As the ſaid effect of ſtaying the plague, hath relation to God, to whom the incenſe was offered up, and by whom that effect was brought to paſſe, it giveth proofe, that
                           IIII. God hath an abſolute power over plagues.
                           
                        
                     
                     As he ſent this plague, whereof See §. 48. before, ſo he pulls backe and reſtraines this plague; he ſo cloſeth the mouth of this devouring beaſt, as it can deſtroy no more: he ſo ſhutteth up and faſt tieth this mad dog, as it cannot bite one more.

                        MEanes muſt be uſed for preſervation of the living. 
                        Exo. 32. 28, &amp;c. After that three thouſand of thoſe that came out of Egypt were ſlaine for worſhipping the golden calfe that Aaron made, Moſes goeth up againe to the mount to pray for their preſervation who were remaining. 2 Sam. 24. 17. So David for thoſe who were reſerved after that ſeventy thouſand were deſtroyed with a peſtilence. This was it which Iſa. 37. 4. 
                        Hezekiah deſired Iſayah to doe, Lift up thy prayer for the remnant
                        
                        that is left: 
                        Ier. 42. 2. and which the remainder of the people after the captivity deſired Ieremiah to do, Pray for all this remnant.
                     
                     While men live, if they have ſinned, they may repent: Benefits of life Eccl 7. 2. 
                        The living will lay things to heart. While they live they may uſe the gifts and abilities of minde or body which God hath given them to the honour of God, and to their owne, and others good: while they live they may increaſe in the good things they have: they may alſo attaine unto more: while they live they may make ſure to themſelves the eternall ſalvation of their ſoules. Life is the time of receiving all needfull grace: and Gal. 6. 10. of doing all manner of good. It is Ioh. 9. 4. 
                        the day wherein men may work. Iſa. 38. 18, 19 
                        The living, the living, he ſhall praiſe thee O Lord. The grave cannot praiſe thee: death can not celebrate thee: they that go downe into the pit cannot hope for thy truth. 
                        Eccl. 9. 10. 
                        There is no worke nor device, nor knowledge, nor wiſdome in the grave. In theſe reſpects true is this proverbe, A living dog is better then a dead lion.
                     
                     How fooliſh, how impious, how ſacrilegious are they, See more againſt praying for the dead in The whole armor of God, on Eph. 6. 18 §. 39, 40, &amp;c. that ſpend this ſweet incenſe of prayer in vaine: as all they do, that offer it up for the dead. If it were uſeful for the dead, why did Aaron ſtand betwixt the living and the dead? Why did he make a difference betwixt them? Why did he not offer in cenſe for the dead as well as for the living?
                     As we deſire to make prayer acceptable to God, comfortable to our owne ſoules, and profitable to others, let us powre them forth for thoſe of whom there may be ſome hope: and thoſe are only the living. 2 Sam. 12. 22. 
                        While the child was yet alive (ſaith David) I facted and wept. For theſe, even for all ſorts of theſe, in health, in ſickneſſe, in ſafety, in danger, while they are young, well growne, or old, in what caſe ſoever, of what ſtate ſoever they be, and for obtaining of what good ſoever may be needfull for them, and for deliverance from what evill ſoever they are ſubject unto, we may, we muſt pray.

                     II. See §. 64. 
                        MEanes muſt be uſed in moſt desperate diſtreſſes. This is eſpecially to be underſtood of ſpirituall meanes, whereby immediately and directly helpe is ſought of God, who can helpe in ſuch caſes as men can ſee no hope of helpe therein. Phyſitians may ſee good ground to give over a patient, knowing that according to the ordinary courſe of nature all the meanes that they can uſe will do no good. But a Chriſtian muſt never ceaſe to uſe the ſpirituall Catholicon, that generall remedy which is fit for any malady, prayer. Note the inſtances given in the former Section, and you ſhall find Moſes, Davids, Iſayahs, Ieremiahs prayers to be made in deſperate caſes. 2 Sam. 12. 16. 
                        Dauids child was queſtionleſſe in mans eye paſt recovery, when he fasted, and lay all night upon the earth, and beſought God for it. Much more paſt recovery was Iſa. 38. 1, 2. 
                        Hezekiah, when God ſent him this meſſage, Thou ſhalt die, and not live: yet he prayed unto the Lord, and was heard. The caſes of many that came to Chriſt for cure in the dayes of his fleſh, were very deſperate, yet found they helpe. Among other, Mar: 5. 25. 
                        A woman which had an iſſue of bloud twelve yeares, and had ſuffered many things of many Phyſitians, and had ſpent all that ſhe had and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worſe, came to Chriſt, and was cured. So Luk. 13. 11. 
                        The woman whom Satan had bound eighteene yeares. So Ioh. 5. 5. the man which had an infirmity thirty and eight yeares. So ſundry Lepers, Demoniacks, men, women, and children at point of death; and many others viſited with incurable maladies.
                     Divine power is not limited with any naturall bounds: it is not reſtrained in that compaſſe which is preſcribed to creatures. It can affoord ſuccour when creatures may think no ſuccour can be affoorded. Inſtance the remedy which God affoorded to man after his fall.
                     Yea when men may thinke the Divine wrath to be implacably incenſed, there may be thoughts of mercy in God.

After the Lord had drowned the world, He ſmelled a ſweet 
                        Gen. 8. 21. 
                        ſavour, and ſaid in his heart, I will not againe curſe the ground. After he had threatned to diſ-inherit Iſrael, Moſes praying for them, he ſaid, I have pardoned according to thy word. 
                        Num. 14. 20.
                     
                     What encouragement have we now to continue our inſtant prayer to God, for ſtaying this plague that now ſo rageth among us. What though it increaſe hundreds every weeke? Iſa 59 1. 
                        Behold the Lords hand is not ſhortned that it cannot ſave: nor his eare heavy that it cannot heare. Though 2 Chro 20 12 
                        we know what to do, yet let our eyes be upon the Lord. Many thouſands are fallen dead before us: yet are there many living among us. Chriſt our true Aaron, our true and great High-Prieſt, he ſtandeth betwixt the living and the dead. He by his interceſſion will pacifie the wrath of his father, and procure his favour for the living. Only, as they who were ſtung with fiery ſerpents, looked on the Braſen Serpent, ſo let us with the eye of faith looke on Ieſus on high at the right hand of his Father. Let not the multitudes of them that are dead, nor the preſent raging of this plague too much daunt us: let us continue to offer up our incenſe to God, and expect his time for deliverance, and deliverance in his time. To encourage us the more hereunto, let the next point be well noted.

                        VVArrantable meanes rightly uſed proove effectuall. This might be exemplified by all thoſe extraordinary meanes which in Scripture are recorded to be preſcribed, or otherwiſe warranted by God. But to inſiſt only on ſuch ordinary meanes as are warranted to us, and to the whole Church of God in all ages, take a view of the prayers which Saints from time to time have made unto God for obtaining good things, and for removing evils: yea of their faſtings, of their teares, of their manifold humbling of themſelves, and you ſhall find them ever to have beene effectuall,

if they have been rightly uſed, as I have See The whole armour of God, on Eph. 6. 18 § 20, 21, 22, &amp;c 97, 104. elſewhere more fully declared.
                     Gods power, wiſdome, truth, and other like attributes are engaged in the meanes which he himſelfe doth warrant. If they being rightly uſed ſhould faile in their efficacy, he that hath ordained them, might be thought improvident in chooſing ſuch means, or impotent and unable to bring what he intended to effect: or unfaithfull and careleſſe in making that good to his people, which by his Word he hath made them expect. But farre are all ſuch things from God. All things therefore ordained by him ſhall aſſuredly be effectuall to effect that for which hee hath ordained them: if at leaſt there be not a failing on mans part in the right manner of uſing them. For we may confidently think and ſay, that where warrantable meanes have failed of their efficacy, the fault hath beene in mans uſing them amiſſe. An Apoſtle hath taught us ſo to avouch. For, ſaith he, Ye aske and receive 
                        Iam. 4. 3. 
                        not, becauſe ye aske amiſſe.
                     
                     Be wiſe now in obſerving what meanes God hath warranted for effecting any thing that we deſire, and alſo what circumſtances he hath preſcribed for the right manner of uſing them Be conſcionable &amp; carefull ſo to uſe thoſe means: and then in faith depend on God for his bleſſing. For thus doing take a few inſtances.
                     1. See The whole armour of God on Eph. 6 16 § 19 God hath ſanctified the Miniſtry of his Word for What meanes God hath ſanctified. How to be uſed. breeding and increaſing faith, and other needfull Chriſtian graces. Frequent therefore the Miniſtry of the Word: attend to it reverently: mixe faith with thy hearing: and unto all adde obedience thereunto.
                     2. See there alſo § 66. The Sacraments are ordained to ſeale up Gods promiſes, for further ſtrengthening of our faith. Take order therfore for your children in due order according to the direction of Gods Word to be baptized. And believe the extent of theſe promiſes, Gen 17. 17. 
                        I wilbe a God to thee, &amp; to thy ſeed after thee.

                        Your children are holy. And as for the other Sacrament, make conſcience of a frequent

participation thereof. But ſee that you examine your ſelves, and ſo eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.
                     3. See The whole armour of God. on Eph. 6. 18. §. 20. Prayer is a preſcribed meanes for obtaining divine benediction on every thing that we take in hand. Pray therefore continually: lift up pure hands without wrath: pray in ſaith.
                     4. Ibid. §. 104. In extraordinary caſes, prayer is to be ſharpned with faſting. Therefore pray and faſt. In your faſts humble your ſoules as well as your bodies: make confeſſion of your ſinnes: and renew your repentance.

                     §. 68. Of Gods power over plagues.
                     IIII. See §. 64. 
                        GOD hath an abſolute power over plagues. Suddenly, as ſoone as he will he can reſtraine them, and keepe them from devouring any more. As he can ſay to the ſea, Hitherto ſhalt thou come, and no further: and here ſhall thy proud waves be ſtayed: ſo can be ſay to the Iob 38. 11. peſtilence, So long ſhalt thou continue, and no longer: ſo many ſhalt thou deſtroy, and no more. 2 Sam. 24. 13, 15, 25. Did not the Lord before hand threaten to ſend a plague upon Iſrael in Davids time three dayes: and anſwerably it continued till the time appointed? But when the wrath of the Lord was pacified, the plague was ſtayed. 
                        Exo 8. 12, 13. 30, 31.—9. 33.—10. 18, 19. Did he not remove the plagues from Egypt, ſo ſoone as Moſes prayed unto him? This power of the Lord over plagues and diſeaſes, was viſibly manifeſted in the Sonne of God, while he lived on earth. For he ſpake the word, and they went away: which the Centurion well obſerving, ſaid to Chriſt, Mat. 8. 8 
                        Speake the word onely, and my ſervant ſhalbe healed.
                     
                     The Lord, as he is the Creatour, ſo the Governour of all things: nothing can be without him: nothing can abide

longer then he will. He calls, he ſends, he bids come, he bids go away: anſwerably they come, they go. Pſal. 105. 28. 
                        They rebell not againſt his word.
                     
                     As ye deſire to have this plague that burneth ſo fiercely among us, and deſtroyeth ſo many, to be ſtayed, uſe the only remedy that is of power to that purpoſe, Call upon God to ſtay it. The plague it ſelfe is like a fierce, mad, maſtivedog, that will not ceaſe to bite if he be looſe. The Lord of plagues muſt chaine him up. Yea, it is like ravenous lions, that are ready to teare in peeces and devoure all they can catch. The Lord onely can ſtop the mouth of this lion, as Dan. 6. 22. he ſtopped the mouthes of the lions among whom Daniel was caſt. All antidotes, all preſervatives, all manner of outward meanes are nothing without the Lord. He can preſerve whom he will while the plague rageth moſt. He can ſtay it as ſpeedily, as ſuddenly, as thorowly as he pleaſe. Call therefore upon him, turne unto him, truſt on him, and doubt not but that our God that hath ſuch power over plagues, will in his good time, when his worke is accompliſhed upon this Citie, and upon this Land, ſtay this plague.
                     This is a point of much comfort to ſuch as have aſſurance of Gods fatherly love to them, that their Father hath an abſolute power over plagues.

                        the famine, and BY the peſtilence. Others therefore thus tranſlate this text, Of the plague, that is, by it. The plague was the inſtrumentall cauſe of their death. Circumſtances ſhew that this plague from the firſt beginning to the end of it continued not a whole day. For ſo ſoone as the people gathered themſelves together againſt Moſes and Aaron, the Lord threatned to conſume them. Then inſtantly Moſes and Aaron fell on their faces: and Moſes then diſcerned that the plague was begun: which ſo ſoone as hee eſpied, he bad Aaron quickely offer up incenſe. Aaron accordingly ranne for incenſe, brought it, offered it up: and the plague was ſtayed. Theſe circumſtances duely weighed, who can imagine that there was more then a day from the beginning to the end of this plague: ſo as in the ſpace of a few houres, foureteene thouſand and ſeven hundred died together of a plague. O terrible ſtroake!
                     To aggravate the terrour hereof, mention is made of another fearefull judgement, which fell upon that people not long before, thus inferred, Beſide them that died about the matter of Korah. What this matter was, the former part of this chapter expreſly recordeth. It was a conſpiracy of Korah, here mentioned, with Dathan and Abiram, againſt Moſes, the chiefe Prince; and Aaron, the chiefe Prieſt, appointed by God over the children of Iſrael. 
                        Exo. 6. 18. This Korah was coſen german to Aaron: for they were brothers children. He therefore being of an ambitious ſpirit, ſcorned that his kinſeman ſhould bee ſo farre preferred before him, as to bee High-Prieſt: Thereupon hee gathers many of the Princes together to take part with him: ſuppoſing by ſtrong hand to wreſt from Aaron the dignity of Prieſt-hood, which the Lord had conferred upon them. Dathan and Abiram were of another Tribe, the tribe of Reuben. Theſe, as is probable, had another aime, and that at the chiefe civill government, wherein God had ſet Moſes. Reuben being the eldeſt ſonne of Iſrael, theſe two brothers were 
                           Pronepotes. Numb. 26. 5. 
                        under nephewes to Reuben, three generations from him: and imagined that they comming

from the eldeſt ſonne ſhould be the chiefe overall. Thus having no regard to the choice which God had made of Moſes and Aaron, they would thruſt themſelves into places of eminency. The Lord was ſo highly diſpleaſed hereat, as he deſtroyed them, and ſuch as tooke part with them, with two fearefull judgements. The earth ſuddenly opened and ſwallowed up ſome of them alive: and fire ſuddenly flamed out upon others and deſtroyed them. Numb. 16. 35. 
                        Two hundred and fifty are expreſly noted to be conſumed by the fire. How many were ſwallowed up by the earth is not expreſſed: but it may be conjectured that they were a great multitude.
                     This was the matter of Korah here mentioned. Korah was the Ring-leader of all. For Numb. 16. 1. he is the firſt mentioned in the conſpiracy. —5. He impudently gathered an head againſt Moſes and Aaron, while —12. 
                        Dathan and Abiram abode in their tents. Numb. 26. 9. It is ſaid of Dathan and Abiram, that they ſtrove againſt Moſes and Aaron in the conſpiracy of Korah. So as the conſpiracy was Korahs eſpecially. He was the chiefe conſpirator. The matter therefore here intended compriſeth under it, both the earths ſwallowing up of ſome, and the fires conſuming of others.
                     The people that by the earths opening, and fires breaking out periſhed, are ſaid to die in the matter of Korah, becauſe his ambition being the firſt motive of that rebellion, he was a cauſe of their ſinne, and ſo of their judgement. Thus their death is imputed to him. They died in his buſineſſe, about his matter.
                     
                     The Summe of this verſe is A declaration of the ſeverity of Gods indignation: which is
                           1. Propounded, in the number of thoſe that died of this plague, 14700.
                           2. Aggravated, by other fearefull judgements executed the day before. Beſides thoſe that died about the matter of Korah. Here have we,
                                 1. A generall intimation of the judgements. Beſides thoſe that died.
                                 
                                 2. A manifeſtation of the originall cauſe of all. The matter of Korah.
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
The firſt point ſheweth, that,
                           I. A plague can quickly destroy a multitude.
                           
                        The aggravation pointeth at other judgements that were the day before inflicted on the people, and giveth evidence, that,
                           II. God can many wayes deſtroy men. By cauſing the earth to open it ſelfe, he deſtroyed ſome: by fire he conſumed others: yet beſides theſe, 14700. die of a plague.
                        The manner of expreſſing the former judgements by relation to Korah, thus, in the matter of Korah, giveth proofe, that
                           III. The bloud of acceſſaries lieth upon the principalls. Korahs matter was the peoples death.
                        In that others died about that matter, it further giveth inſtance, that
                           IIII. Acceſſaries make themſelves liable to the judgement that falleth on the principall.

                     I. See §. 69. A Plague can quickly deſtroy a multitude. Here within leſſe then a day 14700. are deſtroyed by a plague. There is mention made before this of a plague, which, though the preciſe number of them that died be not expreſſed, may be thought to have deſtroyed as many as this plague, for it is ſaid that, Numb. 11. 33. 
                        The Lord ſmote the people with a very great plague. After theſe (but before they went out of the wilderneſſe) at one time there —259. 
                        died in a plague 24000. 2 Sam 24. 15. In Davids time there died within the ſpace of three dayes almoſt three times 24000 of a plague, viz. 70000. 2 King. 19. 35 In Hezekiahs time when Sennacherib came againſt Ieruſalem, there died of a plague in one night, more then twice as many of the hoſte of Sennacherib, as did of all Iſrael in the foreſaid three dayes, viz. 185000. Other hiſtories relate very great deſtructions cauſed by plagues.
                     
                        Thucydides maketh mention of a plague that began at Lib. 2 Belli Pelopon. anno ſecundo. 
                        Ethiopia, fell downe into Egypt, and Afrique, and into the

greateſt part of Perſia, and invaded Athens on a ſudden, where dying men lay tumbling one upon another. Their Temples were filled with the dead. Lawes of funerals were broken: every one burying where he could find roome. And while fires were made to burne ſome dead corps, others were brought and caſt thereinto.
                     
                        Euſebius recordeth a plague at Alexandria which made Eccleſiaſt Hiſt. lib. 7. cap. 21. every man to howle thorow the City by reaſon of the multitude of dead corps, which daily fell. There was not an houſe where no courſe was found. And the Heathen there left their dead unburied, to be devoured of dogs.
                     At Rome when Camillus died, there died ten thouſand 
                        Heurm. de peſte. cap. 1. every day of the plague. And under Veſpaſian and Commodus Emperours, two thouſand were every day taken away with that infectious diſeaſe.
                     Vnder Iuſtinian a plague with ſuch violence fell upon Bizantium and the bordering places, as every day there died Alſted. in Theſaur. Chronol. Mirab. Dei. an. 547. Idem. Ibid. an. 729. Idem. Ibid. an. 1348. 
                        five thouſand, and ſome dayes ten thouſand.
                     At Conſtantinople a plague ſwept away three hundred thouſand perſons.
                     Vnder Charles 4. an Epidemicall plague waſted the whole world for three yeares together. At Lubeck it deſtroyed foureſcore and ten thouſand: and at Florence an hundred thouſand.
                     In Petrarchs time ſo fierce a plague invaded Italy, that Idem. Ibid, an. 1359. there remained alive ſcarce ten of a thouſand.
                     But to leave Forraigne parts, we will give ſome inſtances of the multitudes of ſuch as have beene devoured by the plague in our owne Country.
                     In the raigne of Edward 2. there was ſo grievous a mortality Stow in his generall Chron. of Engl. an. 9. Edw 2. Idem. Ibid. an. 22. &amp; 23. Edw. 3. of people, as the quicke might unneath burie the dead.
                     In the raigne of Edward 3. a farre greater plague happened. It came from beyond. ſea into the townes and parts of England joyning on the ſea-coaſts in Dorſet-ſhire, where even as in other countries it made the country void of Inhabitants, ſo as there were almoſt none left alive. Thence it

paſſed into Devon-ſhire, and Somerſet-ſhire, even unto Briſtow, where it much raged. It came alſo to Glocester, Oxford, and London, and finally it ſpread over all England, and ſo waſted the people, as ſcarce the tenth man was left alive. When Church-yards were not large enough to bury their dead in, they choſe certaine fields appointed for that purpoſe. For the dead in London 
                        The Charter-Houſe was afterwards built thereon. Regiſter of the Charter-Houſe excarta. a peece of ground called Spittle-croft, containing 13 acres, without the barres of Weſt-Smithfield, was purchaſed, encloſed, and dedicated. In that place were buried the yeare following more then fifty thouſand perſons. Acts &amp; Monum. an. Edw. 3. 22. An. Dom. 1348. Two thouſand are ſaid to be there buried every day from Feb. 1. till the beginning of May following, beſides thoſe which in other places in and about the City were buried. Of that plague there died in Norwich from Ian. 1. to Iuly following, fifty ſeven thouſand an hundred and foure, and in Yarmouth ſeven thouſand fifty two.
                     In Richard the ſeconds time, a great peſtilence was in Stow. in his generall Chrō. Rich. 2. 15. An. Dom. 1391 Ibid. Edw. 4. 18 An. Dom. 1479 
                        Norfolk, and other countries. Beſides other places, in a ſhort time there died therof in the city of York eleven thouſand.
                     Vnder Edward 4. an innumerable company of people died of the plague in London, &amp; in divers other parts of the Realm.
                     In the raigne of Henry 8. there was ſuch a plague, as in Ibid. Hen. 8. 5. An. Dom. 1513 one houſe, to wit the Minories without Aldgate, there died 27. profeſſed Nunnes, beſides lay-people and ſervants in that houſe.
                     In the raigne of Edward 6. was alſo a great peſtilence.
                     In Queene Elizabeths time many Engliſh being ſent to Ibid Edw. 6. 2. 1548. Ibid Q. Eliz. anno 4. 
                        New-haven for the ſafeguard thereof, ſuch a plague there fell, as the ſtreets lay even full of dead corps, not able to be removed by reaſon of the multitude that periſhed. From thence the ſouldiers brought the infection into England. Beſides thoſe that died in other parts of the Realme there died in London liberties and out-pariſhes from Ian. 1. 1562. to Dec. 31. 1563. twenty thouſand one hundred thirty and ſixe, beſides thoſe which died of other diſeaſes. Againe, from Dec. 29. 1592. to Dec. 20. 1593. there died in

                        London and the liberries of all diſeaſes 17893. of the plague 10673.
                     In the firſt yeare of King Iames from Dec. 23. 1602. to Dec. 22. 1603. in London and the liberties thereof there died of all diſeaſes 38578. Of the plague 30578.
                     In the firſt yeare of King CHARLES from Dec. 22. 1624. to Dec. 23. 1625. of all diſeaſes 54267. of the plague 35417.
                     It hath beene §. 48. before proved that a plague is an effect of Gods wrath, an immediate ſtroake of his hand. Such a ſtroake muſt therefore needs be heavy, and deſtroy many where it lighteth, eſpecially when the Lord ſo ſtriketh therewith, as he will ſhew that he is angry.
                  
                  
                     §. 71. Of the terrour of a plague.
                     O Make not a tuſh at a plague: ſleight it not too much. Why a plague is not to be made light of. If we account the lives of men, women and children to be precious, (how precious a thing life is, hath beene § 63. Lege Flavij Ioſephi Antiquit. Iud. lib. 7. cap. 13. Deſcriptionē peſlis quae contigit ſub Davide. Terrorem iſtius morbi ad vivum exprimit.
                         before declared) we may well thinke that that which taketh away the lives of many, is to be accounted a terrible thing. I deny not but that in ſome reſpects warre, in other reſpects famine is more terrible then peſtilence: which made 2 Sam. 24. 14. 
                        David chooſe it, rather then either of them. Yet is a plague, if once it grow to any ſtrength, a fearefull and terrible judgement. By it, parents that have had many children like Olive plants round about their table, have beene ſoone made childleſſe. By it parents, children, husbands, wives, maſters, ſervants, whole houſholds have beene in a very ſhort time ſwept away. Yea ſtreets, and villages, and cities have thereby beene made deſolate. On ſome it commeth more mildly, and taketh them away without any paine, or extraordinary fervour: on others it falleth more violently, caſting them into extreme burning fits, troubling the braine, diſturbing the underſtanding, making them that are affected therewith, rage and rave, and ſeeke all wayes to make away themſelves. Lamentable experience hath given too evident

proofes hereof. Beſides, by reaſon of the contagion and infection of this diſeaſe, deare friends are kept one from another, and they that are viſited therewith, deprived of many outward helpes, and inward comforts that otherwiſe they might have. Finally, they that die of this diſeaſe are for the moſt part deprived of the honour of that decent and ſolemne funerall which otherwiſe they might have: a matter Eccl. 63. Ier. 22. 18. 19. which God himſelfe hath threatned as a judgement: but 1 King. 14. 13 Ier. 34. 5. promiſed an honourable, and comely buriall as a bleſſing. In theſe and many other reſpects a plague is juſtly to be accounted a fearefull judgement: which ſhould make us more fearefull of provoking his wrath that hath the power over plagues, to ſend them when he will, to continue them as long as he will; and to make them as fierce and violent as he will. See more of this point, § 48, 50.
                  
                  
                     §. 72. Of the many meanes that God hath to deſtroy men.
                     II. See § 69. 
                        GOD can many wayes deſtroy men. Many, many are the wayes that are recorded in Scripture: and yet many many other wayes hath experience in all ages given evidence of. We read that from heaven Gen 7. 11. water fell and drowned the whole world: and —19. 24. fire and brimſtone, and deſtroyed foure cities at once; and Ioſ. 10. 11. great ſtones that flew armies of men; and 1 Sam 7. 10. great thunders, and Pſal. 18. 14. lightnings, whereby hoſts of enemies have beene diſcomfited; yea and —78. 48. hot thunderbolts: Iud. 5. 20. the ſtarres in their courſes, and Pſal. 35. 5, 6. 2 Sam. 24. 16. 2 King 19. 35. Per culices ac mures integros Barbarorum exercitus ſugabat Deus. Chryſ in 2 Cor. 5. Hum. 8 the Angels of God have deſtroyed many. All theſe, and many other meanes of deſtruction hath the Lord ſent from heaven. On earth he can raiſe up men againſt men to deſtroy one another, which is moſt uſuall: He can ſtirre up Ezek. 14 15. 
                        beaſts, and Ier. 8. 17. ſerpents, yea Numb 21. 6. extraordinary fiery ſerpents, and Exo 8. 6. frogs, —17. lice, —24. flies, —10. 13. graſhoppers, and innumerable other kinds of creatures. How many kinds of diſeaſes hath God in all ages raiſed up to afflict and deſtroy men? What Phyſitian can reckon them all up. He can make all the elements his inſtruments

to conſume men, and all manner of creatures: yea, he can make new creatures to be his ſcourges. Read in particular the Lev. 26. 16, &amp;c Deu. 28. 16, &amp;c ſeverall curſes recited by Moſes, and we ſhall find juſt cauſe to ſay, God can many wayes destroy men.
                     
                     God is a ſupreme and abſolute Lord over all: and can both diſpoſe them to what worke and ſervice it pleaſeth him, and alſo enable them to effect whatſoever he putteth them unto. So as what he will have to deſtroy, ſhall deſtroy as he will have it. Yea, his Divine power is then eſpecially manifeſted, when by vile things he effecteth great matters. 
                           Tunc maximè manifeſtatur Dei potentia, quando per viles operatur magna. Chryſ. in 2 Cor. 5. Hom. 8.
                     
                     Is not this Lord now to be feared? Is it ſafe to provoke his wrath? Doth he not ſinne againſt his owne ſoule that provoketh him? What if he have inflicted ſore judgements on others, and thou haſt eſcaped? Doeſt thou thinke that God hath no more judgments in ſtore, if thou continueſt to provoke him? Were they that were not ſwallowed up with Dathan &amp; Abiram, or not conſumed with Korahs complices, were they exempted from all other judgments? Were not 14700 conſumed with a plague? Remember this aggravation, BESIDES thoſe that died, &amp;c. Remember it, and tremble. Thou maiſt eſcape this plague, and yet periſh by another judgement. Rejoyce not becauſe the rod of him that ſmote thee is broken: for out of the ſerpents root ſhall come

                     III. See §. 69. 
                        THe bloud of acceſſaries lieth upon the principalls. The Devill is the chiefeſt principall of all ſinners. He firſt ſinned himſelfe, he firſt tempted and drew man into ſinne. In this reſpect he is ſtiled Ioh. 8. 44 
                        A murtherer from
                        
                        the beginning. Now a murtherer pulleth upon his owne pate the bloud of thoſe that are murthered. The woman who tempted Adam to ſinne, is ſaid to be 1 Tim. 2. 14. 
                        In the tranſgreſſion: whereby among other things is implied, that her owne and her husbands bloud lieth on her. 2 King. 10. 31 This ſtile given to Ieroboam (which made Iſrael to ſinne) ſheweth that he was the principall in the defection of the ten Tribes: 1 King. 15. 29 anſwerable therefore was his puniſhment: and —30. his cauſing others to ſin is rendred as a reaſon of the ſeverity of his puniſhment. Becauſe David was the principall in the murther of Vriah, 
                        2 Sam. 12. 9, 10 his bloud is laid eſpecially to Davids charge. Thus the deſolations that came upon Ieruſalem, after Manaſſehs time, are ſaid to be 2 King. 24. 3 
                        for the ſinnes of Manaſſeh, who was the chiefe ringleader unto thoſe abominations in which they continued untill the captivity, Ier 3. 6.—25. 3. notwithſtanding that good Ioſiah did what he could to make a thorow reformation.

                        2 Chro. 33. 12, 13. 
                        Manaſſeh repented, and had his ſinne pardoned. How then could he bring others bloud upon his owne head?
                     
                        Anſw. Gods pardoning of ſinne doth not extenuate ſinne; and his taking away bloud from a mans ſoule, doth not imply that that man never brought bloud upon his ſoule, but rather the contrary: for that which is not on man, cannot be taken away from him.
                     For the maine point, it ſtands with juſtice and equity, that they who do not onely ſinne themſelves, but alſo draw others into ſinne with them, ſhould beare the puniſhment of their owne and others ſinnes. For in thoſe others he ſinneth. They are as his inſtruments. If a man do not onely in his mind invent and plot ſinne, but alſo with his body and the parts thereof execute it, he pulleth on himſelfe the greater vengeance. So doth he further heape up vengeance againſt his owne ſoule, if he proceed on to draw others alſo to ſinne. Theſe ſeverall degrees manifeſt a more wretched diſpoſition, aggravate his ſin the more, the more incenſe Gods wrath, and ſo cauſe greater vengeance.
                     
                        Be wiſe now therefore, O ye Kings; be inſtructed ye Iudges of the earth. All ye that are in place of eminency, on whom

many eyes are caſt, whoſe example many are ready to follow, 
                           —Componitur orbis Regis ad exemplum. Claud. de 4. Conſul. Honorij. at whoſe word many are ſoone moved to do this or that: be ye wary how you commit ſinne your ſelves, how you manifeſt any approbation of ſinne: how you give any countenance to ſinne. Abuſe not your authority to command any ſinne, as 2 Sam 13. 28. 
                        Abſolom did. Abuſe not your wit to contrive and adviſe ſinne, as —16. 21. 
                        Achitophel did. Abuſe not your eminency of place by making your ſelves an example and patterne in ſinne, as 2 Chro. 33. 9. Manaſſeh did. Abuſe not that grace you have with a multitude, to perſwade them to ſin, as Mat. 27. 20. the Prieſts and Elders of the Iewes did. Abuſe not that awe and dread wherein you have your inferiours under you, to compell them to ſinne, as Dan. 3. 1. &amp;c. 
                        Nebuchadnezzar did. Abuſe not that dependance which people have on you, O Miniſters, by ſpeaking well of evill, by ſtrengthening the wicked, as Ier. 23. 14. the falſe Prophets did. By theſe and other like meanes, whereby you draw others into ſinne, you pull the bloud of thoſe others upon your owne ſoules. Now to have not onely ones owne bloud, but the bloud of others alſo to lie upon him, is a moſt fearefull eſtate. Thus he doth not onely as much as in him lieth, draw many into eternall deſtruction, but alſo implunge himſelfe more deeply into hell fire. For, all thoſe ſinnes which others commit by his meanes, are as ſo many heavy waights lying on his ſoule, preſſing it downe into everlaſting torment.

In relation to God ſaith a gratefull Prophet, what ſhall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards me? Pſal. 116. 12. In relation to man ſaith a gratefull King, Is there yet any left of the houſe of Saul, that I may ſhew him kindneſſe for Ionathans ſake? 2 Sam. 9. 1. Let me ſay it boldly, for I ſay it truly. My ſoule is inquiſitive: as in regard of God, what I may render unto him: ſo in regard of your ſelfe, Good Mrs. Moore, what I may render unto

you. God knowes my minde and heart. For he is the Searcher of hearts, (Ier. 17. 10.) To you it muſt be made knowne. For what man knoweth the things of a man ſave the ſpirit of man which is in him? 1 Cor. 2. 11. My heart therefore being filled with gratefulneſſe towards you, I haue caſt this way and that way how to manifeſt the ſame: and that in the beſt manner that I could: which I know not better how to do, then by a publique acknowledgement of the gratefull reſpect I beare, and bounden duty which I owe to you: together with the true and juſt grounds thereof: which, among many other, are theſe in particular.
                  1. Your ancient and conſtant reſpect to me and my Miniſtry, even from the firſt beginning thereof. For thereby you firſt tooke notice of me.
                  2. The many reall demonſtrations, and evident teſtimonies of that entire reſpect, which from time to time you have given me.
                  3. Your vouchſafing to take my daughter into your houſe, under your good government, and to become a mother to the motherleſſe. Among many other, this is one thing which gives me occaſion to ſay in regard of my laſt dangerous ſickneſſe, It is good for me that I was afflicted. That ſickneſſe was an occaſion of your taking my daughter to your tuition. What is, what ought to be a fathers care, but (next to the ſalvation of his owne ſoule) the good education of his children? What can be more acceptable to him, then approved means tending to that end? May I then, can I then be unmindfull of her, or ungratefull to her that hath affoorded ſuch means? Have I not cauſe to be inquiſitive, and to thinke and ſay, What ſhall I render? Render a recompence I cannot. All that is or can be

done, is and can be but a teſtimony of gratitude. Such teſtimonies as are ordinarily preſented for new-yeares-gifts, your bounty (I know) doth not expect, will not accept. Noble ſpirits do herein reſemble the Divine Spirit, which doth good for his owne ſake, for goodnes ſake. All the recompence which they expect is a gratefull acknowledgement of the kindneſſe they ſhew, of the goodnes they do. This from my heart I do here before all that ſhall caſt their eyes upon this Dedicatory Epiſtle.
                  There are, beſide theſe particular, other more generall motives, which induce me to prefixe your worthy name before this treatiſe: As, 1. the eminency of your endowments, which make this ſtile Mrs. Mary Moore (at leaſt in their judgement who well know you) more eminent, then ſuch titles of honour as are conferred upon many of your ſex. 2. The excellency of your parts, which enable you with judgement to read ſuch treatiſes as are publiſhed to the view of all. 3. The correſpondency of your diſpoſition to the moſt principall points of this treatiſe. This treatiſe is of famine, and of means to remove it, or reſtraine it, and keep it from exceſſe. Piety towards him that cauſeth plenty and ſcarcity: Prudence in well ordering preſent abundance: Providence for the future: Compaſsion in times of want: Liberality to ſuch as need: Contentment in that whereunto God calleth: Patience in all judgements: Diligence in ſearching after the cauſes thereof: Conſcience in uſing the meanes warranted and ſanctified for averting judgements: Confidence in greateſt neceſſities are principall points handled in this treatiſe. The naming of the particulars is enough to give evidence of the ſutableneſſe of your diſpoſition thereunto.

The preſent neceſſity of the times, wherein bread the ſtaffe of mans life is ſo ſcarce, have drawne my thoughts to meditate on the ſubject matter handled in this treatiſe (which is in one word, FAMINE) that I might ſtirre up my ſelfe and others to take notice of the beginning of Gods judgement: that wiſely we may ſeek the Lord betimes, and uſe all good means for moderating and removing this inſtant dearth, and for preventing the like, or any other heavier judgment for the future. So as I cannot think ſuch a ſubject at ſuch a time to be unſeaſonable: if at leaſt the Compoſer of the Treatiſe were able anſwerably to handle it. But as it is, I have made bold to dedicate it to your patronage; whom, for the reaſons before rendred, and many other like to them, I judge to be as fit thereto, as the treatiſe it ſelfe is fit for the preſent time. In all greatefulnes it is preſented unto you. With all kindnes let it be accepted of you. As for recompence, To him that is ready graciouſly to accept, and able plenteouſly to reward all goodneſſe done for his ſake to any of his, knees are humbly bowed at the Throne of his Grace, by

                           2 SAM. 21. 1.Then there was a famine in the dayes of David, three yeares, yeare after yeare, and David enquired of the Lord.
                     
                     
                        A Remedy for a famine is here ſet before us. Such a remedy as removed the famine where it was uſed. For it is ſaid, Verſe 14. 
                        After that, God was entreated for the land: that is, ſuch ſatisfaction being made for the ſin which provoked Gods wrath, and brought the famine upon the land, Gods wrath was appeaſed, and thereupon the famine removed.

                        be moved to do what is deſired. Now David beſought the Lord, to remove that famine, and God granted his deſire.

                         The firſt particle is a copulative particle, and properly ſignifieth, and; yet is it oft uſed as a conjunction of time; eſpecially when it coupleth hiſtories together. Therefore not unfitly is it here tranſlated, then.
                     
                     But great queſtion is moved about the time, when this famine In what yeare of David the famine began. ſhould be. Whether after all the forementioned hiſtories of Abſaloms rebellion, and Shebaes defection, or before them.
                     That which hath given occaſion to this queſtion, is a computation of time ſet downe for the beginning of Abſaloms rebellion, thus, And it came to paſſe after forty yeares that 
                        2 Sam. 15. 7. 
                        Abſalom ſaid, &amp;c. Thoſe forty yeares are ſuppoſed to be the forty yeares of Davids raigne. Which if it be granted, this famine can neither follow after Abſaloms rebellion, nor be about that time. For David raigned but forty yeares: and this famine continued three yeares.
                     To take away all queſtion, ſome ſay that this and other hiſtories following to the end of this booke, are not ſet downe in juſt order of time: but, as memorable matters, are Per

                         added after the former hiſtories that depended one upon another.
                     It cannot be denied but that the Scripture ſometimes ſo tranſpoſeth hiſtories. Neither will I much contend about the tranſpoſing of theſe hiſtories. No great inconvenience will follow thereupon. Yet the ground of all ſeemeth not to be very ſound. For by many arguments it may be evinced that thoſe forty yeares before mentioned, are not to be accounted the forty yeares of Davids raigne.
                     For firſt, beſide that there is no mention of Davids raigne in that place, the phraſe is thus expreſſed in the originall, 
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                        From the end of forty yeares. Now its more probable that David ended his raigne rather within the forty yeares, then beyond them. Becauſe both in ſacred Scripture, and other writings, the yeare wherein a King dieth is computed

in the yeares of his raigne: ſo as, if David had raigned full forty yeares, and entred into another yeare, he would in a round reckoning have beene ſaid to have raigned one and forty yeares. Now if Abſalom began his rebellion at the end of forty yeares, and David raigned no longer then forty yeares at the moſt, how could ſo many things as are noted of Abſaloms rebellion, and the conſequences following thereon, be done in ſo ſhort a time?
                     2. In the time of Abſaloms rebellion it is ſaid of David, 
                        2 Sam. 17. 8. 
                        He is a man of warre, and will not 
                              •
                           odge with the people. Yea, David himſelfe offered to go out in battell againſt Abſalom. 
                        —18. 2. Yet, 1 King. 1. 1. before David died, ſuch frigidity fell upon him, as with cloathes they could not keepe him warme, but were faine to bring a yong virgin to lie in his boſome. How can ſuch an alteration be thought to be in ſo ſhort a time?
                     3. All the hiſtories recorded of David in the eight laſt chapters of the firſt of Chronicles, were without all queſtion after Abſaloms rebellion. How then can that rebellion be imagined to be in the end of Davids fortieth yeare?
                     The forty yeares therefore from the end wherof Abſaloms rebellion began, muſt needs have relation to ſome other thing then the raigne of David. As to the beginning of the

And ſo this, and the hiſtories following, may well follow as they are ſet in order of time.
                     The time at large is ſaid to be

                        in the dayes of David: that is, in the time of his raigne. For the time of a Kings raigne is ſaid to be 1 Sam. 14. 52. 1 King. 4. 25.—14. 30. Daies what they imply. Gen. 47 9.

When Iaakob would ſet out the brevity of his life, he thus expreſſeth it, The daies of the yeares of my pilgrimage. And Iob, thus, Are not mans daies as the daies of an hireling? And David, thus, Thou hast made my daies

                        Famine importeth want of food for nouriſhment of the body. It comes from a word that ſignifieth to hunger.
                     
                     The famine here mentioned continued three whole yeares together: and therefore after he had mentioned three yeares, he addeth,

                     The courſe which David tooke for removing the famine, was to enquire what courſe the Lord would preſcribe: which is thus expreſſed, David enquired of the Lord: word for word in the originall thus,

                        Quest. How did David here enquire of the Lord?
                     
                        Anſw. The particular manner is not expreſſed. Diverſe manners are in other places ſet downe. For, David
                        
                           1. Sometimes by the High-Prieſt enquired of the Lord, 1 Sam. 22. 15. This was the moſt ordinary way, appointed by the Lord, Exo. 28 30. Numb. 27. 21.
                           2. Other times by an extraordinary Prophet, 1 Sam. 22. 5. &amp; 2 Sam. 7. 2. Ioſephus the Iew ſaith, that the Prophets made anſwer to David about this famine.
                           
                              
3. Yea, many times alſo by himſelfe, humbly preſenting 
                                 Davidi Prophetae dixerunt velle Deum, &amp;c. Item, David audiens ex Prophetis Deum velle, &amp;c. Ioſeph. Antiq. Iud. l. 7. c. 12. his ſupplication to God for direction, 1 Sam. 23. 2. &amp; 2 Sam. 5. 19.
                        
                     
                     It is moſt probable that David here enquired of the Lord by the moſt ſolemne and approved way, which was by the Prieſt. And that, for that end, he went to the Arke of God; and in that reſpect may fitly be ſaid, to ſeeke the face of the Lord.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 2. Of the reſolution and obſervations of this text.
                     THe Summe of this text is, A meanes for removing a Famine.
                     
                     The Parts are two.
                           1. A Deſcription of the Famine.
                           2. A Declaration of the Meanes.
                        
                     
                     In the Deſcription we have
                           1. The thing deſcribed, expreſly ſet downe. There was a famine.
                           
                           2. The aggravation thereof: and that by two circumſtances.
                                 1. The time wherein it fell out. Set out by the King that then raigned. In the daies of David.
                                 
                                 2. The continuance thereof: which is
                                       1. Generally expreſſed, Three yeares.
                                       
                                       2. Particularly exemplified, Yeare after yeare.
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     
                     In the declaration of the meanes there is obſervable
                           1. The perſon that uſed the meanes, David.
                           
                           2. The action that he did, ſought, or enquired.
                           
                           3. The object, or party of whom he enquired, Of the Lord.
                           
                        
                     
                     This text thus opened, affoords ſixe conſiderable obſervations.
                     
                        I. A famine is a judgement. So is this famine here mentioned: which moved David to enquire about it. The cauſe of this famine rendred by the Lord, in the latter end of this

verſe, and the courſe which David tooke for removing it, do evidently prove that this famine was a judgement.
                        2. A famine may be under a pious Governour. If ever there was a pious Governour, David was he. Many worthy commendations are given of him: yea, he is made a patterne of a good Governour. Therefore 1 King. 3. 14.—11. 38. God himſelfe ſetteth his example as a patterne before his ſucceſſours. And —15. 11. 2 King. 18. 3.—22. 2. good kings are thus commended, He did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord as did David. And evill kings are thus diſcommended, 2 Chro. 28. 1. 1 King 14. 8. 
                           He did not that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, like David. Yea, of ſuch as halted, in ſome things doing that which was good, in other things that which was evill, it is ſaid, 1 King. 11. 4.—15. 3. 
                           His heart was not perfect as the heart of David. Yet there was a famine in the daies of David.
                        
                        III. A famine may long continue without intermiſſion. The famine here mentioned continued three whole yeares together. A long time.
                        IIII. Cauſes of judgements are to be ſought out. The enquirie here mentioned importeth as much.
                        V. Chiefe Governours ought to be moſt ſolicitous in publique judgements. David the King is herein ſet out as a patterne.
                        VI. God is to be ſought unto for removing judgements. So David here enquires of the Lord.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 3. Of famine a judgment.
                     I. See § 2. A Famine is a judgement. As a judgement it is Lev. 26 26, &amp;c. Deut. 28. 23, 38 53. threatned in the law, and put into the catalogue of the curſes, that were fearefull judgements: and Iſa 51. 19. Ier. 42. 16. Ezek. 6. 12. by the Prophets, who were raiſed up to denounce Gods judgments afore-hand to his people. Ezek. 5. 16. 2 Chro. 20 9. Ier. 24. 10.—27. 8. Where the Scripture mentioneth three ſharp mortall arrowes of the Lord which he uſeth to ſhoot as judgements againſt children of men, famine is one: one of the ſharpeſt. 2 Sam. 24. 13. Theſe three arrows, as three ſore judgments, were brought to David for him to chooſe one of

them to be ſhot againſt him, but he would not chooſe famine. Where the Lord ſaith, Deut. 32. 23, 24. 
                        I will ſpend mine arrowes upon them, in amplification thereof he addeth, They ſhalbe burnt with hunger, 
                        Ioel. 1. 2, &amp;c.—2. 1, &amp;c. Famine is the judgement which the Prophet Ioel doth moſt pathetically bewaile: and for removing whereof he calleth the whole land to prayer and faſting. 1 King. 8. 35, 37. Famine is one of the judgements which Salomon in his effectuall prayer at the dedication of the temple earneſtly deprecateth and prayeth againſt.
                     In the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtories of the Primitive Churches, it is recorded that a very ſore famine fell out in the dominions Euſeb. Eccle ſiaſt. Hiſt. lib. 9 cap. 7. &amp; 8. Niceph. Caliſt. Eccleſiaſt. Hiſt. l. 7. c. 27. &amp; 28. of Maximinus the Emperour, upon his publiſhing of cruell and bloudy edicts againſt Chriſtians. This Maximinus was the authour of the ſeventh fierce and fiery perſecution. In his Edicts he laid the blame of all publique judgements on Chriſtians. But the foreſaid famine, together with a fearefull plague accompanying the ſame, beſides ſundry rebellions and inſurrections, gave evident demonſtration of Gods indignation againſt that Emperours cruelty.
                  
                  
                     §. 4. Of the effects of famine.
                     IF the effects of famine be duly conſidered, it will appeare that it is a moſt ſore and fearefull judgement. Lege Ioſeph. de bello Iud. l. 6. cap. 11, 14, 16. &amp; 1. 7. c. 7, 8
                     
                     1. It bringeth ſuch as have had abundance, enough for themſelves and all that belong unto them, yea and much over-plus for the reliefe of others, to extreme penury and beggery. It exhauſteth all the mony that the rich have, and forceth them to ſell away all their goods, cattell, and lands, (Inſtance the Egyptians who ſold all to Ioſeph, Gen. 47. 18, 19.) and to let go any thing: as Iaakob, who let his darling 
                           Famis extremitas patris amorem dicit. Chryſ. Hom. 64. in Gen. 43. 
                        Benjamin go into Egypt (Gen. 42. 11.) Extremity of famine overcame the fathers love.
                     2. It depriveth poore men of means to worke and labour for their living. The Prophet, (Zac. 8. 10.) ſpeaking of times of famine, ſaith, There was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast. Thus meanes of livelihood were taken away.
                     
                        
3. It maketh men hard-hearted againſt the cries of ſuch 
                           Qui ex opulentioribus eſſe videbantur, multitudine petentium abſterriti, poſtquam innumera praeſtiliſſent, immitem &amp; rigidum animum induebant, verentes ne eandem &amp; ipſi cum petentibus brevi paterentur egeſtatē.

                              ebantur. Ibid. l. 15. c. 10. as ſtarve. For men that have for the preſent, feare that the famine may bring them to want, and thereupon refuſe to give to others. Yea deare and tender mothers are forced to ſtop their eares againſt the cries of their young children, having nothing to feed them withall, Lam. 2. 12. and 4. 3, 4.
                     4. It forceth ſuch, as otherwiſe would deale juſtly, to uſe fraudulent and violent meanes to get their living. So much doth he intimate, who praying againſt extreme poverty, rendreth this reaſon, Least I ſteale (Prov. 30. 8, 9.) and he who ſaid; Men do not deſpiſe a thiefe, if he ſteale to ſatisfie his ſoule, when he is hungry, Prov. 6. 30.
                     5, It puts men upon dangerous attempts, and makes them deſperate: according to the proverb, Hunger makes men breake thorow ſtone walls. The deſperate reſolution of the hunger-ſtarv'd lepers giveth inſtance hereof, (2 King. 7. 4.) It was this, Let us fall unto the hoste of the Syrians. If they ſave us alive, we ſhall live: and if they kill us, we ſhall but die. We got our bread, ſay the Iewes, with the perill of our lives, Lam. 5. 9.
                     6. It maketh many, if at leaſt they can get paſſage, to fly their country; and ſo voluntarily to baniſh themſelves. Abraham and Iſaak, by reaſon of famine, went to countries where they ſuppoſed themſelves to be in great danger for their wives (Gen. 12. 10, 12. and 26. 1, 7.) A famine cauſed Iaakob with all that belonged to him, to go downe into Egypt. (Gen. 46. 6.) and Elimelech with his family to go to Moab (Ruth. 1. 1.) and the Shunemite with her houſhold to go to the Philiſtines, (2 King. 8. 2.)
                     7. When people know not whither to go, or can not go from the place where they are (as in a city beſieged) it bringeth men to feed on the courſeſt things that they can get. As on horſe bread, on all manner of rootes, on acorns, on horſes and aſſes, on mice, rats, and all kind of vermine, on doves dung, on leather, and any other thing that can be chewed, and ſwallowed. Yea it bringeth ſuch groſſe things to high prices, 2 King. 6. 25.
                     
                        
8. It cauſeth men to be inhumane, and to eate one anothers

Quidam pallidi, &amp; ſumme macilenti, perinde atq. ſimulachra quaedam, rerum omnium egeni, hinc &amp; inde oberrantes, proni in trivijs ipſis concidebant. Niceph. Eccleſiaſt. Hiſt l. 7. c. 28. fleſh, (Zac. 11. 9.) and not to ſpare the neareſt and deareſt they have. For it cauſeth husbands to eate the fleſh of their wives: wives of their husbands: parents of their children: tender mothers of their children new borne, (Deut. 28. 54, 55, 56, 57.) There is an expreſſe inſtance of this kinde of inhumanity in the ſiege of Samaria. (2 King. 6. 29. Read alſo Lam. 2. 20.)
                     9. It moveth men to eate their owne fleſh, (Iſa. 9. 20. Eccl. 4. 5.) This hath beene oft obſerved of ſuch as have beene hanged alive in chaines.
                     10. It procureth ſundry diſeaſes. Among other ſickneſſes, the infectious, and mortall, and moſt uncomfortable ſickneſſe, the peſtilence followeth moſt commonly on famine. Experience of all ages hath given evidence to the truth hereof.
                     11. It cauſeth the moſt miſerable death that can be. It firſt taketh away all the glory and beauty of a creature: it maketh the fleſh to pine all away, and the skin to cleave to the bones. Then commeth on a lingring death, more intolerable then any ſpeedy torture. The Prophet thus with much paſſion and compaſſion ſets it out. The Nazarites were purer then ſnow: they were whiter then milke: they were more ruddy in body then rubies: their poliſhing was of ſaphire: Their viſage is blacker then a cole: they are not knowne in the ſtreets: their skin cleaveth to their bones: it is withered: it is become like a ſtick. (Lam. 4. 7, 8.) And againe, Our skin was black like an oven becauſe of the terrible famine (Lam. 5. 10.) Hence he maketh this inference, They that are ſlaine with the ſword are better then they that are ſlaine with hunger: for theſe pine away, &amp;c. Lam. 4. 9. Our Eccleſiaſticall hiſtories alſo relate that in time of famine men being pale and extremely leane, even as very images, deſtitute of all things, wandred up and downe, fell groveling in the ſtreets, &amp;c.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 5. Of preventing famine by procuring plenty.
                     
                        FAmine being a judgement, and (as by the fore-named effects thereof is evident) a fearefull judgement, it will be our wiſdome to do what in us lieth to prevent it, or to Sec § 7. moderate it, or to Sec §. 8. remove it.
                     For preventing Famine, we muſt
                           1. Obſerve ſuch duties as procure plenty. Plenty how procured.
                           
                           2. Avoid ſuch ſinnes as cauſe famine.
                        
                     
                     For procuring and continuing plenty, Col 1. 10. 
                        Walke worthy of the Lord, unto all well pleaſing: being fruitfull in every good worke. Thus the Lord finding thee to be a fertile ſoile, he will ſow all manner of needfull ſeed plentifully in thee.
                     To this worthy walking is in particular required,
                     1. An acknowledgement that the plenty which thou haſt commeth from God. Hereof we have a worthy patterne in him who ſaid to the Lord, Pſal. 145. 15, 16. 
                        The eyes of all waite upon thee, and thou giveſt them their meate in due ſeaſon: thou openeſt thine hand, and ſatisfieſt the deſire of every living thing.
                     
                     2. Thankſgiving to God for what thou haſt: and for the refreſhing and benefit thou reapeſt thereby. Deut. 8. 10. This is expreſly commanded to this end.
                     3. An uſing of what thou haſt to the glory of God, accorcording to this Apoſtolicall direction, 1 Cor. 10. 31. 
                        Whether you eate or drinke, or whatſoever you do, do all to the glory of God. Gods creatures are uſed to his glory, when (beſides the fore-mentioned acknowledgement of Gods providence in giving them, and bleſſing him for them) we endeavour in the uſe and ſtrength of them to be the better enabled to do that worke which God appointeth us to do: And when we beſtow ſome of that which God beſtoweth on us, upon pious uſes, which after a peculiar manner tend to the honour of his name. To this tendeth Salomons advice, Prov. 3. 9. 
                        Honour the Lord with thy ſubſtance. 
                        —10. Mal.

                           . 10. Plenty is expreſſely promiſed hereunto.
                     
                        
4. Charity to the poore. Thus thou ſoweſt ſuch ſeed, as will bring forth a plentifull crop. To this kind of ſeed the Apoſtle applieth this proverbe, 2 Cor. 9. 6. 
                        He that ſoweth bountifully ſhall reape bountifully. Somewhat more directly ſaith the Wiſeman, Prov. 11. 25. 
                        The liberall ſoule ſhalbe made fat: and he that watereth ſhalbe alſo watered himſelfe.
                     
                     5. Providence in laying up againſt a deare yeare. Thus 
                           Vir juſtus providet multo antea. quo futurae penuriae ſuccurri poſſit. Chryſ Hom 64 in Gen. 41. may the abundance of one yeare make ſupply of ſcarcity in another yeare, and future want be prevented. By ſuch a provident care in ſummer, Bees, Ants, and other like unreaſonable creatures have abundance in winter. Pro 6. 6. To ſuch creatures we are ſent for inſtruction. Gen. 41. 48, 54. 
                        Ioſeph by ſuch a provident care brought it to paſſe, that when a dearth was in all lands, there was bread in all the land of Egypt. And if the famine had not continued ſo long as it did, the ſtore which Ioſeph laid up, might have made plenty, notwithſtanding a yeares famine or more.

Theſe ſinnes are Sec A Plaiſter for the Plague, on Num. 16. 46 § 45. Dei beneficia ad i'los referunt, qui cultorum ſuorum animas perdiderunt. Hier. Comment. lib 1. in Os. 2. elſewhere reckoned up.
                     The particular ſinnes which the Holy Ghoſt noteth in ſpeciall manner to be fore-runners and cauſes of famine, are theſe that follow and ſuch like.
                     1. Superſtitious attributing of plenty to other authors then to the onely God from whom all plenty commeth. So did the Iewes that ſaid, Ier. 44. 17. 
                        When we burnt incenſe, and powred out drinke offerings to the Queene of heaven, we had plenty of victuals. Hereupon —26, 27. 
                        the Lord ſware that they ſhould die of famine. So where Iſrael ſaid, Hoſ. 2. 5. 
                        My lovers gave me my bread, and my water, my wooll, and my flaxe, mine oile, and my drinke, the Lord anſwereth, —9, 12. 
                        I will take away my corne
                        
                        in the time thereof, and my wine in the ſeaſon thereof, &amp;c. I will deſtroy her vines and her figtrees. &amp;c.
                     2. Ingratitude. It is Gods uſuall dealing to take away from ungratefull perſons the bleſſings which he hath beſtowed on them. God gave the Egyptians ſeven yeares of Gen. 41. 53, 54. Omnia auſeret Deus, ut qui ex copia datorem non ſenſerant, ſentiant expenuria Aug. loc. citat. Lege Chryſ. Tom. 2. Hom. 29.

God therfore gave them ſeven years of ſuch ſcarcity, as all the former plenty was utterly conſumed. God will take away all from ſuch, that they who by plenty diſcerne him not to be the giver of all, may diſcerne it by want.
                     3. Perverting of plenty to gluttony, drunkenneſſe, and all exceſſe. Of them that uſed to riſe up early in the morning that they may follow ſtrong drink, that continue untill night, til wine enflame them: and the Harp, and the Viole, the Taebret, and Pipe, and wine are in their feasts, it is ſaid, their honourable men are famiſhed, and their multitude dried up with thirst, Iſa. 5. 11, 12, 13.
                     4. Prodigality: or a laviſh ſpending of that abundance which God giveth. Chriſt exemplifieth this in him that is commonly called the prodigall child. Thorow his prodigality he brought himſelfe to ſuch penury, as He faine would have filled his belly with the huske that the ſwine did eate, and no man gave unto him, Luk. 15. 13, 16.
                     5. Inſenſibleneſſe of their miſery who are in want: To them that ſtretch themſelves upon their couches, and eate the lambs out of the flock: that drink wine in bowles, and annoint themſelves with the chiefe ointments: but are not grieved for the affliction of Ioſeph: The Lord ſaid, The banquet of them that ſtretched themſelves ſhalbe removed, Amo. 6. 4, 6. 7.

                         Such were the Gibeonites that lived among the Iſraelites. (Ioſ. 9. 15.) Vpon theſe Saul executed much cruelty: and for that cauſe God ſent this famine, 2 Sam. 21. 1. If uncharitableneſſe to ſtrangers, much more to our owne poore, muſt needs incenſe Gods wrath, and move him to withdraw plenty even from the rich, and make them to want.
                     7. Rejecting the Word of God, which is the bread of

life. To thoſe that ſaid to the Prophet Ieremiah, Propheſie 
                        
                           Quomodo quis poterit, etiam cui ſaxeum cor, lantum contemptum non gravatim ferre. Chryſ. Hom. 6. in Gen 1. de contemp tu verbi. Pſeudoprophetae preſpera promittendo ſupplantāt populum Dei. Hier. Comment l. 3 in Ier. 15. 
                        not in the name of the Lord, thus ſaid the Lord of hoſte, Their ſonnes and their daughters ſhall die by famine, Ier. 11. 21, 22. By want of corporall food God doth viſibly demonſtrate their folly in deſpiſing ſpirituall food.
                     8. Miniſters ſoothing of people with conceipt of plenty, when the Lord threatneth famine. Of the Prophets that ſaid, Ye ſhall not ſee the ſword, neither ſhall ye have famine, the Lord ſaid, The prophets propheſied lies in my name; I ſent them not; By ſword and famine ſhall thoſe prophets be conſumed. And the people to whom they propheſie, ſhalbe cast out in the ſtreets of Ieruſalem, becauſe of the famine and the ſword, Ier. 14. 13, 15, 16.
                     9. Refuſing to ſubject our ſelves to that yoke and government under which God will have us to be, Ier. 27. 8, &amp;c. For, ſuch a government is a meanes of enjoying that which is needfull for us. But reſiſting the ſame is a meanes of ſpoiling us of all.
                     10. Wilfull ſtanding out againſt ſuch meanes of proviſion as God affoordeth becauſe it is not pleaſing unto our ſelves. As when an enemy beſiegeth a city, and there is no hope of meanes to raiſe the ſiege, nor ſufficient in the city long to hold out: and by the enemy conditions for preſerving of life are offered: by ſtanding out too ſtifly in this caſe, God is provoked by famine to deſtroy ſuch men in their city. So dealt God with the Iewes, Ier. 21. 9. 2 King. 25. 3.
                  
                  
                     §. 7. Of moderating a famine.
                     FOr moderating a famine when it is begun,
                     1. Proviſion muſt in time be ſent for to ſuch places as have plenty. Gen. 42. 1, 2. So did Iaakob.
                     
                     2. They who are abroad muſt ſtirre up ſuch as have plenty to be mindfull of thoſe that are preſſed with famine, and ſend ſuccour to them. 2 Cor. 8. 1, &amp;c Saint Paul was very diligent herein.
                     
                        
3. More then ordinary diligence in every ones place and calling muſt be uſed: that all of all ſorts may eate their owne bread. Thus will not ſome few have the burthen of many lying upon them, which much increaſeth a famine.
                     4. Moderation in diet muſt be uſed, and that by thoſe that have greateſt ſtore. That which is ſpared may be for ſupply to thoſe who have nothing at all. A little ſcarcity by immoderate laviſhing ſoone produceth a great famine.
                     5. Frequent faſts muſt be made by thoſe that have plenty: and what is ſpared at ſuch faſts, given to thoſe that have not ſufficiency. Thus many may be ſuſtained by that which a few do ordinarily ſpend.
                     6. Then eſpecially muſt men obſerve the counſell of Chriſt, to invite to their table the poore, the maimed, the lame, and the blind. 
                        Luk. 14. 13.
                     
                     7. Publique proviſions muſt be wiſely diſtributed: according to the diſtribution of Manna, whereof they had Exo. 16. 18. 
                        every one according to his eating: that is, according to the number of perſons in a family, and according to their age, ſtature and ſtrength.
                     8. Magiſtrates muſt be more then ordinarily carefull in preſerving peace and keeping good order: that neither the rich and mighty oppreſſe the poore and weak (as he that having many flocks and heards of his owne, tooke from a poore 2 Sam. 12. 2, 3, &amp;c. man that had but one little ewe lambe, that lambe to entertaine a traveller that came to him:) nor the poore and needy felloniouſly and violently take from the rich. In time of famine Magiſtrates muſt be the more diligent and carefull, becauſe feare of want will make them that for the time have enough, oppreſſe others: and preſent ſenſe of want will move them that have nothing, by hooke or crooke to get what they can. And what is violently or fraudulently gotten, wilbe laviſhly ſpent: and ſo the famine prove to be the greater.
                     9. Miniſters muſt be the more carefull to feed their people with the bread of life: that by the plenty and ſweetneſſe thereof, they may the more patiently and contentedly beare the want of bodily food. This is the means to inſtruct men,

                        both to be full, and to be hungry: both to abound and to ſuffer 
                        Phil. 4 12. 
                        need. Such inſtruction wil make famine much more tolerable.
                     10. All of all ſorts muſt with patience expect the time and means which God ſhall give for ſuccour, and not preſcribe time or means to God. Much leſſe murmure againſt God, or charge him with any evill, or refuſe to wait on him, ſuppoſing that he can not or will not affoord any ſuccour: as he who ſaid, This evill is of the Lord: what ſhould I wait for the 
                        2 King. 6. 33.—7. 2. 
                        Lord any longer? And as the other that ſaid (when Eliſha propheſied of much plenty, and that ſuddenly) Behold if the Lord ſhould make windowes in the heavens might this be? Meditation on Gods promiſes for ſuccour in famine, is of ſpeciall uſe to worke patience.
                  
                  
                     §. 8. Of removing famine.
                     MEanes of removing famine are ſuch as theſe.
                     1. Humiliation, and that eſpecially for §. 6. the ſinnes wherby God hath bin provoked to ſēd famine. 2 Chro. 7 13, 14. This means even in this caſe is expreſly preſcribed by God himſelfe, and a promiſe made of ſucceſſe therto. That it may be the more effectuall, it muſt ariſe inwardly from the ſoule, and be manifeſted and helped by faſting, weeping and mourning, Ioel. 2. 12.
                     2. Confeſſion, and that both of our owne guiltineſſe, and alſo of Gods juſtice in depriving us of his creatures. Salomon

                        Daniels prayer. For this end Examination of our own inward corruptions, and of our former courſe of life, yea and due obſervation of the publique and common ſinnes of the times and places wherein we live, is very requiſite: that thus, if it be poſſible, we may find out thoſe particular ſinnes, which have in ſpeciall incenſed Gods wrath, and provoked him to afflict us with famine: and as we find them, ſo in particular to confeſſe them: as they, who ſaid, 1 Sam. 12. 19. 
                        We have added unto all our ſins this evill, &amp;c.
                     3. Converſion.

anſwerable to confeſſion. It muſt be univerſall, from all manner of ſinne, whereof we ſhall find our ſelves guilty, and

To confeſſe ſuch ſinnes, and not to turne from them, is to mocke God, and the more to incenſe his wrath againſt us.
                     4. Satisfaction for wrongs done to man: at leaſt if the wrong be ſuch as God is moved to revenge. This I do the rather here note, becauſe it is a meanes of removing the famine mentioned in my text. For when David had made ſatisfaction for the wrong done to the Gibeonites, God was entreated for the land, 2 Sam. 21. 14.
                     5. Supplication. 
                        Ioel 1. 14. 2 Chro. 6. 28, 29—7. 13, 14. This is the moſt principall meanes of all. All the other are but preparations hereunto. This is likewiſe preſcribed, and a promiſe of prevailing thereby annexed thereunto. Iam. 5. 18. It hath beene uſed and proved to be effectuall.
                     6. Faith in Gods promiſes. This muſt be added to prayer. Both Christ 
                        Mar. 11. 24. and Iam. 1. 6. his Apoſtles require as much. Gods promiſes have their true and proper effect only in ſuch as believe: and to them they are effectuall, either for ſufficient ſupportance, or for a good deliverance.
                     7. Charity to the poore. For God will ſuccour ſuch as are ready with their uttermoſt ability to ſuccour others. This is eſpecially for ſuch as have corne, or other proviſion in ſtore: to bring it forth, and give it freely, or at leaſt to ſell it at a cheape rate to the poore. Bleſſing is promiſed to him that ſelleth it: namely, to the poore, and at a reaſonable rate, Prov. 11. 26.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 9. Of promiſes for ſuccour in famine.
                     
                        Queſt. ARe there any particular promiſes for helpe in famine, and deliverance from it?
                     
                        Anſw. Yes, very many: as many as in any other like caſe. Some of the particulars are theſe. 2 Chro. 7. 13, 14. 
                        If I ſhut up heaven (ſaith the Lord) that there be no raine, or if I command the locuſts to devoure the land, if my people ſhall humble themſelves, and pray, and ſeeke my face, and turne from their wicked wayes: then will I heare from heaven, and will forgive their ſinne, and will heale their land. 
                        Hoſ. 2. 21, 22. 
                        In that day I will heare, ſaith the Lord, I will heare the heavens, and they ſhall heare the earth, and the earth ſhall heare the corne, and the wine, and the oyle, and they ſhall heare Iezreel. 
                        Ioel 2. 18, 19. 
                        Then will the Lord be jealous for his land, and pitie his people, yea the Lord will anſwer and ſay unto his people, Behold, I will ſend you corne, and wine, and oyle, and you ſhalbe ſatisfied therewith. 
                        Zac. 8. 11, 12. 
                        Now will I not be to the reſidue of this people, as in the former dayes, ſaith the Lord of hoſts. For the ſeed ſhalbe prosperous: the vine ſhall give her fruit, and the ground ſhall give her increaſe, and the heavens ſhall give their dew.

                        Prove me now ſaith the Lord of hoſts, if I will not open you the windowes of heaven, and powre you out a bleſſing, that there ſhall not be roome enough to receive it.

                     THat the fore-mentioned promiſes may with the ſtronger confidence be reſted upon, take inſtance of How the righteous are exempted from judgement. Gods performing them. Gen. 12, 10, 17 When in Abrahams time there was a famine in the land where he ſojourned, he went downe into Egypt, where the Lord kept him and his wife in ſafety. —26. 1, 2. Whē again there was a famine in Iſaaks time, God directed him whither to go. —45. 5. —50. 20. Pſa. 105. 16, 17 God ſent Ioſeph purpoſely before hand into Egypt to preſerve Iaakob and all that were with him in famine. 2 King. 8. 1. By his Prophet God adviſeth the Shunemite with her houſe to ſojourne where was plenty, when he intended to bring a famine on Iſrael. 
                        1 King. 17. 4. 16. Miraculouſly did the Lord provide for Eliah and the widow of Zarephats in famine. So did he for the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe. Exo. 16. 13, 14 When they wanted bread and meat, extraordinarily he provided Manna and Quailes for them: and —17. 6. when they wanted water, he brought it out of a rocke for them. So Iudg. 15. 18, 19. for Sampſon, when he was ready to die for thirſt, God extraordinarily provided water. 1 King. 18. 42 At Eliahs prayer, after Gods wrath was pacified, on a ſudden, raine, having beene with-held three yeares and an halfe, fell downe abundantly. 2 King. 6. 28. —7. 6, &amp;c. 
                        Samaria being ſo long beſieged as they began to eate their children, the Lord on a ſudden with an extraordinary terrour cauſed the enemies to flie, and to leave all their proviſion to the Iſraelites, ſo as they had all manner of food in great plenty.
                     Theſe viſible and extraordinary evidences give ſenſible demonſtration of Gods power and pity: how able and ready he is to ſuccour people in their extremities. And due notice is the rather to be taken of theſe, that we may know that when by more ordinary meanes ſuccour is affoorded, it is the Lord that ordereth and diſpoſeth thoſe meanes: and his providence is to be acknowledged therein, as much as if extraordinarily he did what is done.

                        FAmine may be under a pious Governour. Beſides the inſtance of David mentioned in this text, it is expreſly noted of the three great Patriarchs, who in their dayes were the ſupreme Governours of Gods Church, that Gen. 12. 10.—26. 1.—46. 5. there was ſuch famine in each of their times, as they were all of them forced from their owne habitations, and ſo journed in ſtrange countries. Ruth 1. 1. 
                        In the dayes of the Iudges there was a famine in the land. Now all the Iudges (except Abimelech, a cruell and tyrannicall uſurper) were pious Governours, extraordinarily ſtirred up by God, and extraordinarily gifted and aſſiſted by him. Yet in their dayes there was a famine: and that as the Ruth 4. 18, &amp;c. generation of Pharez giveth evidence, in Deborahs time, who (though a woman) was one of the beſt Iudges.
                  
                  
                     §. 12. Of the cauſes of judgements under good Governours.
                     1. THe beſt Governours have many times moſt impious ſubjects under them: the cry of whoſe ſinnes, they being many and impudent, more incenſeth Gods wrath againſt a nation, then can be pacified by the piety of a righteous Governor, or of a few righteous ſubjects, though they be men of extraordinary endowments. For thus ſaith the Lord by one prophet, Ier. 15. 1. 
                        Though Moſes and Samuel ſtood before me, yet my mind could not be towards this people. And by another thus, Ezek. 14. 14, 16. 
                        Though theſe three men, Noah, Daniel, and Iob were in the city, they ſhould deliver neither ſonne nor daughter. 
                        2 Sam. 24. 1. In Davids time the anger of the Lord was ſo kindled againſt Iſrael, as he moved David against them. 
                        Ier. 3. 6, 10. Ioſias vir ſanctus non ſclum peccatorem populum ſuis virtutibus non ſalvavit, ſed &amp; ipſe in peccatis illius mortuus eſt. Hier. Commēt. l 4. in Ezec. 14. 
                        In the dayes of good Ioſiah Iudah waxed rebellious: ſo rebellious, as that pious King was ſo farre from preſerving that ſinfull people, as he himſelfe died for their ſinnes. No marvell then that God ſend famine, and other ſore judgements upon a land in the

time of pious Governours to puniſh ſuch ſubjects.
                     2. The moſt pious Governors do oft alſo themſelves give too juſt cauſe unto God to ſay, Rev. 2. 4. 
                        I have ſomewhat againſt you. It is in the regiſter of truth recorded, what he had againſt Numb. 20. 22. 
                        Moſes and Aaron, againſt 1 Sam. 2. 29.

                     3. God doth ſometimes treaſure up the ſinnes of predeceſſours, and extend his wrath unto ſucceeding generations. Excellent things are ſpoken of Ioſiah and his Government; yet at the end of all this diſmall doome is added, 2 King. 23. 26 
                        Notwithſtanding the Lord turned not from the fierceneſſe of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled againſt Iudah, becauſe of all the provocations that Manaſſeh had provoked him withall. In our text we ſee how God treaſured up Sauls bloudy ſinne till Davids time.
                  
                  
                     §. 13. Of puniſhing predeceſſours ſinnes in their ſucceſſours time.
                     
                        Quest. HOw can it ſtand with Divine equity and juſtice that ſucceeding ages ſhould be puniſhed for the ſinnes of their predeceſſours?
                     
                        Anſw. They are not ſimply and onely judged for their predeceſſours ſinnes. The ſinnes of predeceſſours do onely aggravate judgements inflicted on ſucceſſours.
                     True is that of Ezekiel, 
                        Ezek. 18. 14, 17. 
                        If a wicked father beget a ſonne that ſeeth all his fathers ſins which he hath done, and conſidereth and doth not ſuch like, he ſhall not die for the iniquity of his father. He ſhall ſurely live. Yet withall is that of the Law as true, Exo. 34. 7. 
                        the Lord viſiteth the iniquity of the fathers upon the children. We muſt therefore diſtinguiſh betwixt children. There are children which no way make themſelves acceſſary to their fathers ſinnes: but rather abhorre them, and pray that they may not be laid to their charge. Theſe ſhall not beare their fathers iniquity.
                     
                        
There are other children which tread in their fathers 
                           Quomodo Sanctorum merita deſcendunt ad poſteros, ſicut David &amp; caelerorum: ſic peccatorum flagitia, ſi liberi, nepotes
                                 
                                    
                                 
                                 que
                               ſimilia geſſerint, ad poſteros perveniunt. Hier. Comment. l. 3. in Hier. 15. ſteps, and commit like abominations, or at leaſt do not conſider their fathers ſinnes, to be humbled for them, or to make ſuch ſatisfaction for them as is meet, and to remove the evill effects of them: but ſome way or other make themſelves acceſſary thereto: and in that reſpect are viſited for them. As the vertues of predeceſſors deſcend to their poſterity, as Davids and others: ſo the wickedneſſe of ſinners ſhall fall upon their poſterity, if their children, and childrens children do the like things.
                     In Ioſiahs dayes, 2 King. 23. 2, &amp;c. though he himſelfe did what lay in him to redreſſe the remainder of his fore-fathers abominations, yet Ier. 3. 6. 10. the people were not thorowly reformed. 2 King. 23. 26. That therefore which is noted of Gods remembring Manaſſehs abominations in Ioſiahs daies, was not in regard of Ioſiah: for it is ſaid, that 2 King. 22. 20. he ſhould be gathered into his grave in 
                        
                           Deus non exaudiet Moyſen, aut Samuelem, quoniam conſummata ſunt ſcelera populi delinquentis. Hier. Comment. l. 3. in Hier. 15. 
                        peace: but it was in regard of the people who continued to cleave to the ſinnes of Manaſſeh, notwithſtanding all the care that Ioſiah tooke for an univerſall reformation. For God will not accept the interceſſion of his beſt Saints, when the wickedneſſe of a ſinfull nation is full, and in that kind perfected.
                     As for Sauls ſinne, 1. David had not redreſſed it as he might and ſhould have done. The ſlaying of the Gibeonites was a publique fact, and that againſt a publique agreement, and oath: ſo as David could not be ignorant thereof. He might therefore, and ought to have enquired of the remnant of the Gibeonites what ſatisfaction he ſhould make: as he did being put in mind of Sauls ſinne by Divine oracle.
                     2. It may be thought that the people had their hand as acceſſaries in ſlaying the Gibeonites. For it is ſaid that 2 Sam. 21. 2. 
                        Saul ſought to ſlay the Gibeonites in his zeale to the children of Iſrael and Iudah. They therefore are juſtly puniſhed with this famine.
                     3. Sauls ſonnes were a wicked of-ſpring of a wicked ſtocke: and retained their fathers evill diſpoſition. For Sauls houſe is ſtiled —1. 
                        a bloudy houſe. Vnder his houſe, his

children are compriſed. The Lord therefore purpoſing to root out all his poſterity, taketh this juſt occaſion. And by this meanes Davids fact in rooting them out is more juſtified before all the people: the envy thereof taken from him: and his kingdome the more ſecured to him and his poſterity. 
                           In hoc Dei Creatoris clementia demonſtratur. Non enim truculeliae eſt &amp; ſeveritatis, ir ā tenere uſ
                                 
                                    
                                 
                                 que
                               ad tertiam &amp; quartam generationem: ſed ſignum miſericordiae paenam differre peccati, &amp;c. Hier. Comment. lib. 5. in Ezek. 18.
                     
                     Herein therefore the clemency of the Creatour is manifeſted: for it is not a part of ſeverity and cruelty to withhold wrath till the third and fourth generation, but a ſigne of mercy to deferre the puniſhment of ſinne. For when he ſaith, The Lord God, mercifull, and gracious, long-ſuffering, and abundant in goodneſſe, and addeth, viſiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the childrens children, he ſheweth that he is of ſuch compaſſion, that he doth not preſently puniſh, but defers the execution of puniſhment.
                  
                  
                     §. 14. Of miſ-judging a profeſſion by outward judgements.
                     IT being ſo evident that famines befall pious polities, it 
                           Audlant qui temerè &amp; incircū ſpectè loquuntur, &amp; divinant, dicentes quoniam quiſpia madvenit ſames facta. Ecce etiam in adtētu juſti fames, &amp;c. Chryſ. Hom. 32. in Gen. 12. muſt needs be a perverſe ground of cenſure, to queſtion a Religion and the truth thereof by reaſon of ſuch an event. Was there any true Church in the world, but the Church of the Iewes, while that politie ſtood? Yet was there no externall judgement from which that was not exempted. A Religion may be ſound and good, though the Profeſſours thereof (thorow their unworthy walking) pull many judgements upon their owne heads: 1 Cor. 11. 30. The Church of Corinth in the Primitive and pureſt time thereof, provoked God to judge them in this world. Yet was the Religion which they profeſſed, taught them by an Apoſtle: the Religion I ſay, not their abuſe therof. There is a better touch-ſtōe to try the truth of Religion by, then externall events. 1 Pet. 4. 17. 
                        Iudgement muſt begin at the houſe of God. 
                        Pro. 11. 31. 
                        The righteous ſhalbe recompenced in the earth. Shall then that be accounted no Church where judgements are? Or they not righteous, who on earth are recompenced?

Well may we judge, that God inflicteth no judgement without a juſt cauſe. But a falſe Religion is not the onely cauſe of judgement. Wherefore neither judge other Churches in their Religion becauſe of famine, plague, or other like judgements befall them: nor thinke the worſe of thine owne profeſſion, eſpecially when thou haſt evidences of the correſpondency thereof to Gods Word, for ſuch cauſes.
                  
                  
                     §. 15. Of duties which judgements under pious Princes require.
                     WOrthy directions are affoorded even to pious Governours and their people, by this publique judgement which God laid on Iſrael in Davids time.
                     Governours muſt therefore
                     1. Make the beſt enquiry they can into former times: and take notice of ſuch publique crying ſinnes as have beene committed, and not expiated either by any publique judgement on Gods part, or by any publique humiliation and ſatisfaction on peoples part. Such ſins are treaſured up. Vengeance may be executed for them in ſucceeding times. Succeſſours therefore ought to do what lieth in their power to make an attonement in ſuch caſes.
                     2. Be carefull over their people to keepe them in good order: That as they themſelves profeſſe, affect, and maintaine true Religion, ſo their ſubjects may ſubject themſelves thereto, and ſhew forth the power thereof. Not common 
                           A Principibus non requiruntur opera tantum trita &amp; vulgaria, ſed ut ſapiāt alijs, ut vivant alijs, ut illis praeluccant omni virtutum genere. Martyr. Comment in 2 Sam. 21. 17. and ordinary works onely are required of Governours: but that they be wiſe for others, live for others, and ſhine out to them in every kind of vertue. Otherwiſe, the ſinnes of ſubjects (notwithſtanding the piety of their Governours) may pull downe publique vengeance.
                     As for people under pious Governours,
                     1. They may not be ſecure and careleſſe, much leſſe diſſolute and licentious, becauſe they have ſuch Governours, as if no judgements could fall on a land in the time of good

Governours. God hath many wayes to puniſh ſuch people even in ſuch times: As by inflicting ſuch judgements, as prove greater plagues to the common people, then to their Governours: as this famine was. (For famine for the moſt part lieth moſt heavy on the meaner ſort:) Or by giving over their Governours to commit ſuch ſinnes as will pull downe publique judgements: as he gave over David: or by taking away their Governours, as he tooke away Ioſiah, 
                        2 Sam. 24. 1. 2 King. 23. 26, 29. and then powring out the vials of his indignation.
                     2. They muſt live in obedience to the pious lawes that are made by their pious Governours. For continuance of Divine bleſſing upon a land, there muſt be like Governours, like Subjects: each worthy of other.
                     Finally, Governours muſt pray for their ſubjects: and ſubjects for their Governours: that thus one may be heard for another, and one keepe judgements from another. Otherwiſe, A famine may be in the dayes of David.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 16. Of long continued famine.
                     III. § 2. A Famine may long continue without intermiſſion. Here was a famine of three yeares, yeare after yeare. 
                        1 King. 18. 1. Luk. 4. 25. Iam. 5. 17. In Eliahs time a famine continued three yeares and ſix moneths. 
                        Gen. 41. 30.—45. 6. In Egypt and all the land of Canaan a famine continued ſeven yeares together. 2 King 8. 1, 2. The like was in Iſrael in Eliſhaes time. In the time of the Iudges a famine continued ten yeares, as by probable arguments may be conjectured. For, Ruth 1. 2. 
                        Elimelech with Naomi his wife went into Moab to ſojourn there by reaſon of a famine in Iſrael. 
                        —6. When Naomi heard that the Lord had viſited his people in giving them bread, ſhe aroſe to go into her owne country. But from the firſt comming of her husband into Moab, to this her returning, ſhe had dwelt —4. 
                        about ten yeares in Moab.
                     
                     1. God ſuffers famine to lie the longer on men, that the ſmart of his ſtroake might be the more ſenſibly felt: and Why famine is long cōtinued. his judgement not lightly regarded. For they who at firſt thinke nothing of famine, ſuppoſing that they have ſtore

enough laid up till the famine be gone, by the long continuance of it are brought to exhauſt all their ſtore: and when they know not whither to turne their eyes, to lift them to God in heaven.
                     2. Mens continuance in ſinne many times provoketh the Lord to continue his judgements on them. 1 King 18. 18 While the Iſraelites continued in Eliahs time to worſhip Baal, the famine continued. But —39, 4
                              •
                           
                         ſo ſoone as they acknowledged the Lord to be God, raine fell downe from heaven abundantly, whereby the famine was removed.
                     3. It is long, in famine, as in other judgements, before men uſe to ſeeke after the true cauſe thereof. But they are ready to lay it on this wrong cauſe, or that wrong cauſe. As 1 King 18. 17 
                        Ahab laid the cauſe of the famine in his dayes on Eliah: and 2 King. 6. 31 
                        Iehoram his ſonne on Eliſha. And Ier. 44 18. the Iewes in Ieremiahs time, on the reformation of their idolatry: and Tertuſ. in Apolog adverſ. Gent c. 40 Cypr. Tract. 1. contr Demetr. Euſeb. Eccleſ. Hiſt. lib. 9. cap. 7. the Heathen in the time of the Primitive Churches, on Chriſtians. Men are more prone to pick out falſe cauſes, then to ſearch out the true cauſe. It appeares to be long ere David tooke a right courſe to find out the true cauſe. Three yeares had firſt paſſed over, But when men have long wearied themſelves in ſearching after falſe cauſes, and obſerve by continuance of famine that they miſſe of the right cauſe: they are forced to take another courſe, and to fly to God for help. On this ground faith the Lord, I will go and returne to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and ſeeke my face: in their affliction they will ſeeke me early.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 17. Of duties by reaſon of long famine.
                     MVch wiſdome may be learned from this kind of Gods dealing with men, in long continuing famine; as the directions following demonſtrate.
                     1. When there is any cauſe to feare a famine, See §. 5. 6. do what lieth in thee to prevent it, and that ſo much the rather, becauſe it may long continue if once it begin. Evils that long continue are the more to be feared, and (if it be poſſible) prevented.
                     
                        
2. When a famine is begun, See A Plaiſter for the Plague. on Numb. 16. 46. §. 50, 51. in the beginning thereof humble thy ſelfe before God: ſeeke to pacifie his wrath betimes. Thus maiſt thou at leaſt prevent the extremity of famine: and move God the ſooner to remove it.
                     3. Provide before hand, for a long time. Gen. 41. 48. Ioſeph ſanctus quemadmodum ſames in poſterum vinceretur provida ordinatione diſpoſuit. Amb. Offic. l 3. c. 6. We have herein a worthy patterne in Ioſeph. Many cities beſieged by enemies have been forced to ſurrender themſelves to the enemy for want of laying up ſufficient ſtore for a long ſiege: which if they had done, the enemie might have been forced to raſe his ſiege, before the city were taken.
                     4. In famine poſſeſſe thy ſoule with patience, (Luke 21. 19.) Such judgements as uſe long to continue, require 
                           Quamdiu eſt tempus famis, to lerandum eſt durandum eſt, perſeverandum eſt uſ

                               in finem. Aug. Enar. in Pſal. 32. the more patience. He that by reaſon of the extremity of a famine ſaid, This evill is of the Lord: what ſhould I wait for the Lord any longer? (2 King. 6. 33.) wanted patience. Had he waited a little longer, he ſhould have had good experience to ſay, Lam 3. 26. 
                        It is good that a man ſhould both hope, and quietly wait for the ſalvation of the Lord.

                        CAuſes of judgements are to be ſought out. 
                        Ioſ. 7. 13, &amp;c. The advice which God himſelfe gave to Ioſhua, when the Iſraelites fled before the men of Ai, tends hereunto. So doth this exhortation of the Prophet, Lam. 3. 40. 
                        Let us ſearch and try our wayes. It was a uſuall courſe with the people of God ſo to do. Gen. 25. 22. When Rebekah felt children ſtrugling together in her, ſhe ſaid, Why am I thus? 
                        Iudg. 20. 23, 27. When the Iſraelites were twice overthrowne by the Benjamites, they both times asked counſell; namely, about that matter. Though Saul were a notorious hypocrite, yet herein he imitated the cuſtome of Gods people, 1 Sam. 14. 38, &amp;c. in ſearching out the cauſe of Gods diſpleaſure. The frequent expoſtulations of Gods people in time of judgements, adde further proofe hereto: ſuch as theſe, Exo. 5. 22. 
                        Wherefore haſt thou ſo evill entreated this people? 
                        —32. 11. 
                        Why doth thy wrath waxe hot againſt thy people? 
                        Iudg. 21. 3. 
                        Why is this come to paſſe in Iſrael? 
                        ſer. 2. 14. 
                        Why is Iſrael ſpoiled? The

                        Pſalmes and Prophets are full of ſuch.
                     The finding out of the true cauſe of a judgement, is a ready

                         way to remove a judgement: we find this true in bodily diſeaſes. Such phyſitians as are moſt skilfull in ſearching and finding out the cauſe of a diſeaſe, are moſt ſucceſſefull in curing the diſeaſe. For it is a principle verified by all ſciences, Take away the cauſe, the effect followes. They that well find out the cauſe of a judgement, wilbe carefull (if they feele the ſmart of a judgement) to pull away that cauſe. Which if it be rightly done, the end why God inflicted the judgement is accompliſhed. God having his end, he will ſoone ceaſe to ſtrike.
                     That which was §. 16. before noted of the reaſon of the long continuance of judgements on children of men, is here further confirmed: namely, mens negligence in ſearching after the true cauſes of them: The power, jealouſie, and juſtice of that God (whoſe mercy moveth him upon removall of the cauſe to remove the judgement) will not ſuffer him to take away a judgement till the cauſe thereof be taken away. And how ſhall it be taken away if it be not knowne? How ſhall it be knowne if it be not ſearched after? Wherefore let all diligence be hereunto given, whenſoever we ſee any evidences of Gods wrath: or have any juſt cauſe to ſuſpect that it is incenſed againſt us.

So as the care not only of their owne ſoules, but alſo of all their ſubjects ſoules lieth on them. They are as ſhepheards to their flocke.

Xenophontis dictum, Chriſt the King of Kings and moſt ſupreme Governour over all is ſtiled the chief Shepheard: and other Governors are called Shepheards, both by the Holy Ghoſt, and alſo by other authors. For the charge and care of a good ſhepheard and a good King are much alike. If any thorow their neglect of any warrantable meanes periſh, their bloud ſhalbe required at their hands.
                     2. Chiefe Goverours have not onely liberty themſelves to uſe ſuch meanes as are preſcribed for removing publique judgements; but alſo power to enjoyne and command all under their authority to do what in ſuch caſes the Lord requireth. 2 Chro 34. 32 
                        Ioſiah cauſed all that were found in Ieruſalem, and Benjamin to ſtand to the covenant which he had made with God.
                     3. They being publique perſons, their example is a great inducement to others to imitate them. So as their care provoketh many to be carefull in uſing all good meanes to remove the judgement.
                     4. They beare Gods image, and ſtand in Gods roome: in which reſpect their ſolicitous care is both more acceptable unto God, and more availeable for effecting that which they aime at. For on the contrary ſide, their ſinnes are more hainous 
                           Regum ac Principum, &amp; praepoſitorum ſcelere, populi plerum

                     Oh that ſuch as are in high and eminent places, that are ſet over others, and are as Gods on earth, were of the ſame mind that David was! That they were thorowly affected with the publique judgements that are from time to time inflicted on their land! That they were carefull and conſcionable in uſing the meanes which in Gods Word are ſanctified for removing judgements! Then aſſuredly would publique judgements be neither ſo ſierce, nor ſo long.
                     Let our prayer be to God daily for our governours, that the Lord would make them eſpecially ſenſible of publique judgements, and conſcionable in doing their parts for removing them. So ſhall God have the honour, they the comfort,

we the profit and benefit. Otherwiſe, if Governours ſinne,

                     VI. See § 2. 
                        GOD is to be ſought unto for removing judgements. Obſerve all the inſtances § 18. before given of ſeeking out the cauſes of judgement, and you ſhall find them all to prove the point propounded of ſeeking to God. Vnto all which 1 King. 8 35, &amp;c. the worthy patterne of Salomons prayer made at the dedication of the temple may well be added. Pſal. 10 15. Amos 5. 4. God himſelfe directs us to ſeeke ſuccour of him. Iſa. 8. 19.—55. 6. Zeph. 2. 3. His Prophets do much preſſe as much. Jer. 50 4. Zac. 8 21. This is made a property of ſuch as are effectually called of God, and Hoſ. 5. 15. on whom judgements do kindly worke. 2 King. 1. 3. Iſa. 9. 13.—30. 1. The contrary, that men ſhould ſeeke of others, rather then of God, is juſtly and ſharply upbraided to them.
                     
                        Iſa 45. 7. Amos 3. 6. It is God that inflicteth judgements on children of men: Who then but he ſhould be ſought unto for removing them but the Lord? No creature can take away that which the Creatour ſends, but the Creatour himſelfe. As this is moſt true of all manner of judgements: ſo in particular of that which we have in hand, which is famine: whereupon I will a little more inſiſt in the Seſſions following.
                  
                  
                     §. 21. Of Gods cauſing famine.
                     THat God ſendeth famine upon a land, is moſt evident by theſe and other like proofes.
                     1. Gods owne teſtimony. For expreſly he ſaith of himſelfe, Amos 4 6, 7. 
                        I have given you cleanneſſe of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places, &amp;c.

3. Gen. 41. 16, &amp;c. 1 King. 17. 1. 2 King 8. 1. Act 11. 28. Predictions of famine, by ſuch as were indued with the ſpirit of God. For God reveales to ſuch what he intends to do. And upon ſuch revelations men of God have foretold famines.
                     4. Deu. 11. 14, 15 Pſal. 145. 16. The plenty which commeth from God. For if God be the giver of plenty: ſurely the want of plenty, yea and famine too, muſt needs be from him. For what is famine, but a want of ſuch things which the Lord giveth to ſuſtaine us? And whence commeth that want, but from Gods with-holding and not giving ſuch things?
                     5. The cauſes of famine; See § 6. Deut. 11. 16, 17 1 King. 8. 36. Pſal. 107. 34. which are ſins againſt God. Sinnes againſt God provoke Gods wrath. Gods wrath incenſed inflicteth judgements. See § 3. Among other judgements which are effects of Gods wrath, famine is one of the principall. Famine therefore muſt needs come from God.
                     6. The meanes and ſecondary cauſes of famine, which are all ordered by God. For ſecondary cauſes do all depend on the high primary cauſe, which is Gods will. Pſal. 119. 91. 
                        All are his ſervants. That this may more evidently appeare, I will inſtance it in ſuch particular meanes as are regiſtred in Scripture, and there noted to be ordered by God.
                  
                  
                     §. 22. Of the meanes of famine ordered by God.
                     MEanes of famine are ſuch as theſe.
                     1. The heavens with-holding raine. For the earth is drie of its owne nature: being drie it can yeeld no fruit. The ordinary meanes of watering and moiſtening it, is raine from heaven. Where that is with-held, the earth waxeth drie and barren: and living creatures want that ſuſtenance which ſhould maintaine their life. But it is God that cauſeth the heavens to with-hold raine. Lev. 26. 19. 
                        I (ſaith the Lord) I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as braſſe. Iron can not diſſolve into water, nor braſſe yeeld out fruit. The meaning then is, that heaven over them ſhould yeeld no raine, nor the earth under them, fruit. More plainely ſaith the Lord in other places, Iſay 5. 6. 
                        I will command the clouds that they
                        
                        raine no raine upon it. 
                        Amos 4. 7. 
                        I have with-holden the raine from you. I cauſed it to raine upon one city, and cauſed it not to raine upon another city. As an evidence hereof, Iam. 5. 17. 1 King. 17. 1. 
                        Elias prayed earneſtly that it might not raine: and it rained not on the earth by the ſpace of three yeares and ſix moneths.
                     
                     2. The heavens ſhowring downe raine in ſuch unuſuall abundance, as thereby the fruits which the earth hath brought forth are deſtroyed: eſpecially in harveſt time. We have few inſtances hereof in Scripture: For Iudea was under an hot climate: ſo as oft they wanted raine, but ſeldome had too much. Our Northerne, cold Regions of the world are moſt puniſhed with over-much raine: which oft cauſeth dearth and famine. Yet that this unſeaſonable and overflowing abundance of water is ordered by God, is evident by that great inſtance of the Gen. 7. 11, 12. 
                        generall deluge: and by that extraordinary inſtance of 1 Sam, 12, 17. 
                        thunder and raine, that at Samuels prayer fell in a day of wheat-haruest. This phraſe, Pro. 28. 3. 
                        A ſweeping raine which leaveth no food, ſheweth that of old there was ſuch immoderate raine as cauſed famine. And this ſpeech of the Lord himſelfe, Ezek. 38. 22. 
                        I will raine an over-flowing raine, and great haile-ſtones, ſheweth, that God ordereth immoderate raine.
                     3. Barrenneſſe of the earth. For Pſal. 104. 14. God bringeth forth food out of the earth. And for their ſuſtenance, Pſal. 115. 16. 
                        The earth hath he given to the children of men. If therefore the earth where men abide be barren, there muſt needs be dearth and famine. But it is the Lord that maketh a land barren. Pſal. 107. 34. 
                        He turneth a fruitfull land into barrenneſſe. In this reſpect it is ſaid, 1 Cor. 3. 7. 
                        Neither he that planteth is any thing, nor he that watereth: but God that giveth the increaſe.
                     
                     4. Very ſharpe winters, extraordinary froſts, ſnow, haile, blaſting, mildew, rotting of ſeed under the clods, and ſuch like meanes as deſtroy corne and other fruits, before they come to maturity for mans uſe. Theſe are expreſly noted to 1 King 8 37 Iocl 1. 17. cauſe famine, and to be Amos 4. 9. ordered by God.
                     5. Pſal. 105. 34. Nah. 3. 15. 
                        Locusts, graſhoppers, cater-pillars, canker-wormes, palmer-wormes, and other like hurtfull creatures which oft by

their innumerable multitudes eate up all the graſſe, corne, herbes, and fruits of the earth whereby men and beaſts are nouriſhed: and ſo Ioel 1. 4. cauſe famine. Theſe God calleth his —2. 25. 
                        great army. They are therefore at his command, diſpoſed by him.
                     6. Enemies. Theſe oft bring great famines: and that by Iudg. 6. 4. 
                        deſtroying the increaſe of the earth, and all manner of cattell, and leaving no ſuſtenance: For they kill, and burne, and ſpoile all that they can, when they enter into others lands. Yea and by blocking up people within narrow compaſſes: girting and beſieging their townes and cities, ſo as they can not go abroad to uſe any meanes for ſupply of their wants. The foreſt famines that ever were, have beene cauſed this way. 2 King. 6. 25. Enemies long beſieging a place, force the incloſed to eate the fleſh of aſſes, the dung of doves, and any thing that they can chew or ſwallow. Yea, it forceth them Deut 28. 53. 2 King. 6. 29. to eate their owne children. Now enemies which ſo afflict others, are Gods Iſa. 10. 5. 15.

                     7. The plague. Many are thereby taken away: others moved to depart from their callings, and meanes of maintaining themſelves, and providing for others. Whence followes penury and famine. We 1 King. 8. 27. Ezek. 7. 15. Ier. 24 10. oft in Scripture reade of plague and famine joyned together. For the one is a cauſe of the other.

                     8. Periſhing of graine, fruit, and other kinds of food in ſtore: or in the places where it is laid up. For it oft falleth out that Monopoliſts, and ingroſſers of corne, and other commodities, do heape up, for their owne private gaine, all the proviſion they can get: which being ſo heaped together, by heate, or moiſture, or ſome ſuch other meanes, muſtieth, putrifieth, and is made unfit for uſe: or by mice, rats, and other vermine is conſumed: or by fire devouted: or ſome other way deſtroyed: whence followeth famine. That ſuch courſes of engroſſing commodities have

of old bene uſed, is evident by this proverb, Prov. 11. 26. 
                        He that withdraweth corne the people ſhall curſe him. That God hath an hand in the ſpoile of ſuch treaſures is evident by Nah. 2. 9. Gods threatning to ſpoile, where there is no end of ſtore.
                     
                     9. Deficiency of vertue in ſuch meanes as men have. This is compriſed under this phraſe of Lev. 26. 26. Pſal. 105. 16.

That Metaphor is taken from an old man, who being not able to ſtand upright of himſelfe, hath a ſtaffe to leane upon, and thereby is ſupported: or from a rent which is held up by the ſtaffe in the midſt of it: if ye breake, or take away that ſtaffe or ſtay, downe will the old man, or the tent fall. This ſtaffe of bread, and ſtay of water, is that vertue which by the Divine providence is in them of nouriſhing ſuch as eate the one, and drink the other. It is therefore by ſome tranſlated, the ſtrength of bread, and the ſtrength of water. By others the vigour and power of

Take away this vertue from bread and water, they are as if they were not: of no uſe, of no benefit. Now it is God onely that gives, or takes away this ſtaffe: and in that reſpect cauſeth famine.
                     As in theſe, ſo in all other meanes of famine the Lord hath an over-ruling providence: ſo as theſe ſecondary cauſes give witneſſe to this, that God ſendeth famine: and that therefore God is to be ſought unto for removing, and taking away famine.

                        Anſw. In generall, God requireth no other meanes of ſeeking him, then what he himſelfe hath ordained. In particular, we have as ſure and certaine a meanes for enquiring of God, as ever the Church had: which is his written Word. This meaneth he who ſaith, We have a more ſure

                     This oracle of God firſt declareth the cauſes of famine: wherof before. § 6. If hereunto we impartially bring the teſtimony of our owne conſcience, we may ſoone find what cauſes hereof are in our ſelves: and how farre we in our perſons have provoked the Lord to judge us. If further we bring a wiſe obſervation of the times wherein, and of the perſons among whom we live, we may alſo find what are the common and publique cauſes of the judgements which God inflicteth.
                     2. This oracle ſheweth what means may be uſed for well ordering or removing that judgement whereof the cauſes are found out. The means noted before, §. 8. are all preſcribed in Gods Word.
                     3. It alſo revealeth ſuch Divine promiſes of bleſſing a right uſe of ſuch means as are therein preſcribed, as we may with much confidence reſt on a good iſſue.
                     Let this therfore be the generall uſe and cloſe of all, that in famine and other like judgements we do as David is here noted to do, enquire of the Lord: enquire of him in and by his word: and withall, as David here alſo did, follow the directions preſcribed by the Lord in his Word; then ſhall we be ſure to have ſuch an iſſue as David had, expreſſed in theſe words, God was intreated for the land.

                     §. 24. Of the extremity of famine in the laſt fiege of Ieruſalem.
                     BEcauſe reference is often made to the hiſtory of Flavius Ioſephus of the warres of the Iewes concerning the extremity of famine in the laſt ſiege at Ieruſalem, by the Romanes in the dayes of Veſpaſian the Emperour, I think it meet in the end of this Treatiſe diſtinctly to relate the ſaid hiſtory ſo farre as it concerneth the famine.
                     The famine of the City, and the deſperation of the Ioſeph de Bello Iud. lib. 6 cap. 11. Houſes broken up and ſearched for corne. theeves both increaſed alike, every day more and more; ſo that now there was no more corne found. Wherefore the ſeditious perſons brake into the houſes, and ſearched every corner for to find corne; and if after their ſearch they found any, then they did beat the owners for denying it at the firſt; and if they found none, they tortured the houſholders, as having more cunningly hidden it: And whoſoever was yet ſtrong of body and well liking, him they preſently killed; for hereby they deemed him to have ſtore of food, or els he ſhould not have been in ſo good plight of body as he was. And they that were pined with famine, were by theſe barbarous ſeditious people ſlaine, who eſteemed it no offence to kill them, who would ſhortly after die, though they were left alive. Many, both rich, and poore, ſecretly exchanged all that they had for one buſhell of corne, and All exchanged for bread. preſently ſhutting themſelves in the ſecreteſt roome of their houſes, ſome of them did eate the corne as it was unground: others made bread thereof, as neceſſity and feare required. No man in the whole city ſate downe to eate his meate on a table, but greedily taking it, not boiled from the fire, they (even raw as it was) did eare it. Moſt miſerable was this manner of living, and a ſpectacle which none without teares was able to behold; for the ſtrongeſt ſtill got the moſt, and the weakeſt bewaild their miſery: for now famine was the greateſt calamity they endured. And nothing doth arme men more then ſhame: for during this famine no reverence Food ſnatched out of one anothers mouths. was had towards any man: for wives tooke the meat even out of their husbands mouthes, and children from their parents,

and mothers even from their infants, which was the moſt lamentable thing of all. No body had now any compaſſion, neither did they ſpare their deareſt infants, but ſuffered them to periſh even in their armes, taking from them the very drops of life. Yet could they not eate thus in ſuch ſecrecy, but preſently ſome came to take away from them that whereon they fed. For if in any place they ſaw any doore ſhut, preſently hereupon they conjectured that they in the houſe were eating meat, and forthwith breaking downe the doores, they came in; and taking them by the throat, they tooke the meat out of their mouthes already chewed, and ready to be ſwallowed downe. The old men were driven away, and not permitted to keepe and defend Cruelty uſed to get food. their food from being taken from them: the women were drawne up and downe by the haire of the head, for that they hid betweene their hands ſome part of their meat, and would not forgoe it. No pitie was now remaining, neither to old age, nor infancy, but they tooke young babes eating, their mouth full of meat, and not permitting it to be taken out of their mouthes, and threw them againſt the ground. Now if any one had prevented theſe theeves, and eaten their meat before they could come at them, then they were more cruell; and the other ſo much more tyrannouſly handled, as having committed ſome greater offence againſt them. They alſo deviſed moſt barbarous and cruell torments to extort food from others: for they thruſt ſticks or ſuch like into the cavity of mens yards, and ſharpe thorny rods into their fundaments: and it is abominable to heare what the people endured to make them confeſſe one loafe of bread, or one handfull of corne which they had hidden.
                     The reſtraint of liberty to paſſe in and out of the City Ibid. cap. 14. tooke from the Iewes all hope of ſafety, and the famine now increaſing, conſumed whole houſholds and families, and the houſes were full of dead women and infants: and the Multitudes die of famine. ſtreets filled with the dead bodies of old men: And the young men ſwollen like dead mens ſhadowes, walked in the market place, and fell downe dead where it happened.

And now the multitude of dead bodies was ſo great, that they which were alive could not bury them, neither cared they for burying them, being now uncertaine what ſhould betide themſelves. And many endeavouring to bury others, fell downe themſelves dead upon them as they were burying them. And many being yet alive, went unto their graves, and there died. Yet for all this calamity was there no weeping nor lamentation, for famine overcame all affections. And they who were yet living, without teares beheld thoſe, who being dead, were now at reſt before them. There was no noiſe heard within the Citie, and the ſtill night found all full of dead bodies: and which was moſt miſerable of all, the theeves at night came and tooke away that which covered the dead bodies nakedneſſe, and went laughing away, and in their bodies they proved their ſwords, and upon pleaſure onely thruſt many through yet breathing. Yet if any have deſired them to kill him, or to lend him a ſword to kill himſelfe, that ſo he might eſcape Death deſired by the famished. the famine, they denied him.
                     What need I recount every particular miſerie? Mannaeus the ſonne of Lazarus flying to Titus out of the gate, Ibid. cap. 6. that was committed unto his cuſtody, and yeelding himſelf unto him, recounted unto Titus, that from the time that the Romans army was placed neare the City, from the foureteenth day of Aprill, unto the firſt of Iuly, were carried out Multitude die of famine. of that gate he kept, a hundred, fifteene thouſand, and foureſcore dead bodies; yet was not he the keeper of the gate, but being appointed to pay for the burying of the dead at the charges of the City, was forced to number the dead bodies. For others were buried by their parents, and this was their buriall, to caſt them out of the City, and there let them lie. And certaine noble men flying unto Titus after him, reported that there were dead in all the City ſix hundred thouſand poore folks which were caſt out of the gates, and the others that died were innumerable: and that when ſo many died that they were not able to burie them, that then they gathered their bodies together in the greateſt

houſes adjoyning, and there ſhut them up. And that a buſhell of corne was ſold for a talent, which is ſix hundred crownes: and that after the City was compaſſed with a wall that now they could not go out to gather any more herbs, many were driven to that neceſſity, that they raked ſinkes and privies to finde old dung of oxen to eate; Dung eaten. and ſo the dung that was loathſome to behold, was their meate.
                     An infinite multitude periſhed within the City thorow Ibid lib. 7. cap. 7, 8. Food violently ſnatched away famine, ſo that they could not be numbered: for in every place where any ſhew or ſigne of food was, preſently aroſe a battell, and the deareſt friends of all now fought one with another, to take the food from other poore ſoules, neither did they believe them that were now a dying for famine, but the theeves ſearched them, whom they ſaw yeelding up the ghoſt, thinking that they dying for famine, had hid about them ſome food, but they were deceived of their hope, being like mad dogs, greedy of meate, and fell againſt the doores like drunken men, ſearching the ſelf-ſame houſes twice or thrice together in deſperation, and for very penury they eate whatſoever they light upon, gathering ſuch things Things loathed eaten. to eat, as the moſt filthy living creatures in the world would have loathed. In briefe, they did eate their girdles and ſhoes, and the skins that covered their ſhields, ſo that a little of old hay was ſold for foure Attiques. But what need is it to ſhew the ſharpneſſe of this famine by things that want life? I will recount an act never heard of, neither amongſt the Greekes, nor any other barbarous people, horrible to be rehearſed, and incredible, ſo that I would willingly omit this calamity, leaſt poſterity ſhould thinke I lie, had I not many witneſſes hereof, and perhaps ſhould incurre reprehenſion, not fully recounting all accidents of them that are dead.
                     A certaine woman named Mary, dwelling beyond Iordane, 
                        A mother kils and eates her owne child. the daughter of Eleazar of the towne of Vitezokia, which ſignifieth the houſe of Hyſope, deſcended of noble and rich parentage, flying with the reſt unto Ieruſalem, was

there with them beſieged. Her other goods the tyrants had taken from her, which ſhe had brought from beyond the river into the City, and whatſoever being hid, eſcaped their hands, the theeves daily came into her houſe, and tooke it away, whereat the woman greatly moved, curſed them, and with hard ſpeeches animated them the more againſt her, yet no man either for anger or compaſſion would kill her, but ſuffered her to live to get them meate, but now could ſhe get no more, and famine invaded her with rage and anger more then danger. Wherefore by rage and neceſſity ſhe was compelled to do that which nature abhorred, and taking her ſonne unto whom ſhe then gave ſucke, O miſerable child (quoth ſhe) in warre, famine, and ſedition, for which of theſe ſhall I keepe thee? If thou continue amongſt the Romans, thou ſhalt be made a ſlave, yet famine will prevent bondage; or elſe ſedition worſe then them both. Be therefore meate for me, a terrour unto the ſeditious, a tragicall ſtory to be ſpoken of by poſterity, and that which is onely yet heard of amongſt the calamities of the Iewes. Having thus ſpoken, ſhe ſlue her ſonne, and did ſeeth the one halfe of him, and did eate it, the reſt ſhe reſerved covered. Preſently came the ſeditious, ſmelling the ſent of that execrable meat, threatning preſently to kill her, except ſhe forthwith brought ſome of that unto them which ſhe had prepared. Then ſhe anſwered that ſhe had reſerved a good portion thereof for them, and preſently uncovered that part of her ſonne which ſhe had left uneaten; at which ſight they trembled, and a horrour fell upon them. But the woman ſaid, this is truly my ſonne, and my doing, eat you of it, for I my ſelfe have eaten thereof. Be not more effeminate then a woman, nor more mercifull then a mother. If Religion make you refuſe this my ſacrifice, I have already eaten of it, and will eate the reſt. Then the ſeditious departed, hereat onely trembling, and ſcarcely permitting this meate to the mother. Preſently the report of this hainous crime was bruited all about the City, and every man having before his eyes this excerable fact, trembled as though himſelfe

had done it. And now all that were vexed with this famine, Chryſ. adverſ. vitup. vitae monaſt. l. 1. Euſeb. Hiſt. Eccleſ. l. 3. c. 6. Niceph. Hiſt. Eccleſ. l 3 c 7. haſtned their owne deaths, and he was accounted happy that died before he felt this famine.
                     This hiſtory of a mothers eating her own child, is related alſo by Chryſoſtome, Euſebius, Nicephorus, and other ancients.
                  
                  
                     §. 25. Of extremity of famine, where were no invaſions of enemies, nor ſieges, but immediately from Gods hand.
                     TO the fore-mentioned extremity of famine cauſed in Ieruſalem, by reaſon of enemies blocking them up, it will not be unſeaſonable to adde a relation, out of our Eccleſiaſticall hiſtories of extreme famine where were no enemies: that we who perhaps do (by reaſon of our long continued peace) thinke our ſelves ſecure enough from feare of enemies, may notwithſtanding feare Gods more immediate revenging hand, even by famine now beginning, after that the plague is mitigated. The hiſtory is this.
                     The inhabitants of the cities of Maximinus, ſore pined away with famine and peſtilence, ſo that one meaſure of Euſeb Eccleſ. Hiſt l 9. c. 8. Niceph. Eccleſ. Hiſt. l. 7. c 28. Famine and Plague together. wheat was ſold for two thouſand and fifty Attiques. An infinite number died throughout the Cities, but more throughout the countries and villages, ſo that now the ſundry and ancient demaines of husbandmen were in a manner quite done away, for that all ſuddenly through want of food and grievous malady of the Peſtilence were periſhed. Many therefore ſought to ſell unto the wealthier ſort, for moſt Deareſt things ſold for ſlender food. ſlender food, the deareſt things they enjoyed. Others ſelling their poſſeſſions by peeces, fell at length into the miſerable perill of extreme poverty: others gnawing the ſmall ſhreded tops of greene graſſe, and withall confuſedly feeding on certaine venomous herbes, uſed them for food, whereby Vnwholſome things eaten. Noble women forced to beg. the healthy conſtitution of the body was periſhed and turned to poiſon. Diverſe noble women throughout the cities,

driven to extreme need and neceſſity, went a begging into the country, ſhewing forth by their reverend countenance and more gorgeous apparell, an example of that ancient and free manner of feeding: Certaine others whoſe ſtrength was dried up, tottering to and fro, nodding and ſliding much like carved pictures without life, being not able to ſtand, ſell downe flat in the midſt of the ſtreets, groveling upon the ground, with their faces upward, and ſtretched out armes, making humble ſupplication that ſome one would reach them a little peece of bread: and thus lying in extremity, ready to yeeld up the ghoſt, cried out that they were hungry, Cries of the ſtarved. being onely able to utter theſe words. Others which ſeemed to be of the wealthier ſort, amazed at the multitude of beggers, after they had diſtributed infinitely, they put on an unmercifull Famine makes unmercifull. and ſturdy mind, fearing leaſt they ſhould ſhortly ſuffer the like need with them that craved Wherefore in Dead lie in ſtreets. the midſt of the market place, and throughout narrow lanes, the dead and bare carcaſſes lay many dayes unburied, and caſt along, which yeelded a miſerable ſpectacle to the beholders. Yea many became food unto dogs, for which cauſe chiefly Men food for dogs. ſuch as lived, turned themſelves to kill dogs, fearing leaſt they ſhould become mad, and turne themſelves to teare in peeces and devoure men. And no leſſe truly did the plague Plague kils ſuch as are kept from famine. ſpoile every houſe and age but ſpecially devouring them whom famine through want of food could not deſtroy. Therefore the rich, the Princes, the Preſidents, and many of the Magiſtrates, as fit people for a peſtilent diſeaſe (becauſe they were not pinched with penury) ſuffered a ſharpe and moſt ſwift death. All ſounded of lamentation, throughout every narrow lane, the market places and ſtreets. There was nothing to be ſeene but weeping, together with their wonted pipes, and the reſt of Minſtreſs noiſe. Death after this (waging battell with double armour, to wit, with famine and peſtilence) deſtroyed in ſhort ſpace whole families.

                     TO other inſtances of great famines let me adde ſuch as have hapned in England: that therby we may the better diſcern what we in this our owne country are ſubject unto.
                     In King William the Conquerours daies there was ſuch a Stow in his generall Chrō of Engl. In the 5. yeare of W. Conq. 1069. dearth thorow all England, eſpecially thorow Northumberland, and the countries next adjoyning, that men were faine to eate horſe-fleſh, cats, dogs, and mans fleſh. For all the land that lay betwixt Durham and Yorke lay waſte without Inhabitants, and people to till the ground for the ſpace of nine yeares, except onely the territory of Beverlake.
                     
                     In King Henry the thirds raigne was a great dearth and peſtilence: ſo that many poore folks died for want of victuals: Ibid. H. 3. 18. 1234. Vermine in corne hoorded up in time of dearth. and the rich men were ſtriken with covetouſneſſe, that they would not relieve them. Amongſt theſe is to be noted Walter Grey, Arch-Biſhop of Yorke, whoſe corne being five yeares old, doubting the ſame to be deſtroyed by vermine, he commanded to deliver it to the husbandmen that dwelt in his mannours, upon condition to pay as much new corne after harveſt; and would give none to the poore for Gods ſake. But when men came to a great ſtack of corne nigh to the towne of Ripon belonging to the ſaid Arch-biſhop, there appeared in the ſheaves all over the heads of wormes, ſerpents, and toads. And the Bailiffes were forced to build an high wall round about the corne, and then to ſet it on fire, leaſt the venomous wormes ſhould have gone out and poyſoned the corne in other places.
                     In King Edward the ſecond his daies a great dearth increaſed Ibid. Edw. 2. 9. 1315. Dearth thorow abundance of raine in harveſt. Horſes, dogs, children, men eaten. through the abundance of raine that fell in harveſt, ſo that a quarter of wheat was ſold before Mid-ſommer for 30 ſhillings, and after, for 40 ſhillings. An high rate in thoſe daies. The beaſts and cattell alſo, by the corrupt graſſe whereof they fed, died: whereby it came to paſſe, that the eating of fleſh was ſuſpected of all men. For fleſh of beaſt not corrupted was hard to find. Horſe-fleſh was counted

great delicates. The poore ſtole fat dogs to eate. Some (as it was ſaid) compelled thorow famine in hid places, did eat the fleſh of their owne children: and ſome ſtole others which they devoured. Theeves that were in priſon did plucke in peeces thoſe that were newly brought amongſt them, and greedily devoured them halfe alive.
                     When Henry 6. raigned, ſcarcity and deareneſſe of corne Ibid. H. 6. 18. 1440. forced men to eate beanes, peaſe, and barley, more then in an hundred yeares before. Bread-corne was ſo ſcarce in England, that poore people made them bread of Fern-roots,
                     In the time of King Henry the eight there fell ſuch raine in November and December, as thereof enſued great flouds, Ibid. H. 8. 18. 1527. Famine cauſed by much raine. which deſtroyed corn-fields, paſtures, and beaſts. Then was it dry till the 12 of Aprill: and from that time it rained every day and night till the third of Iune, whereby corne failed ſore in the yeare following.
                     Againe in the time of the ſaid King, ſuch ſcarcity of bread was in London, and in all England, that many died for Ibid. H. 8. 19. A preſident for Princes. default thereof, The King of his goodneſſe ſent to the City of his owne proviſion 600. quarters, or elſe for one weeke there had beene little bread. The bread-carts comming from Stratford-Bow towards London, were met at Mile-end by the Citizens: ſo that the Major and Sheriffs were forced to go and reſcue the ſaid carts, and to ſee them brought to the markets appointed.
                     Many more inſtances of exceeding great dearth in other Kings times might be added, but theſe are ſufficient.
                  
                  
                     §. 27. Of uſes to be made of the terribleneſſe of famine.
                     BY the forementioned inſtances of famines in this our and, it is manifeſted what may befall us: how patient the Lord is toward us: what cauſe we have to feare God, and to take heed how we provoke him to inflict even this judgement, which may prove very fearefull, as hath beene proved: and finally, how it ſtandeth us in hand, when there is cauſe to feare a famine, or when a famine is begun, to

ſearch out the cauſes thereof, to confeſſe before God our ſinnes, to turne from them, humbly, heartily, earneſtly, extraordinarily, with weeping, faſting, and prayers to ſupplicate mercy of the Divine Majeſty. We have a late evidence of the efficacy of ſuch meanes uſed. For in the yeare 1626 it rained all the ſpring, and all the ſummer day after day for the moſt part, untill the ſecond of Auguſt, on which day by publique Proclamation a Faſt was ſolomnly kept thorowout the whole Realme of England, and Principality of Wales, as it had by the ſame Proclamation beene ſolemnized in the Cities of London and Weſtminſter and places adjacent, on the fift day of Iuly before. On the ſaid ſecond of Auguſt the skie cleared, and raine was reſtrained, till all the harveſt was ended: Which proved a moſt plentifull Harveſt. Thus the famine threatned and much feared was with-held. So as Gods ordinances duly and rightly uſed are now as effectuall as ever they were.

Vpon mention made of Moſes, there commeth to my mind this great commendation (He is faithfull in all my houſe) given to him by God himſelf. Faithful he was in his own obſervation of al Gods ordināces which belonged to him. Who of ſo eminēt a place, more eminent then your Honour herin? Faithful he was alſo in deputing to the Lords

                           ſervice men fit for their function. The abundance of able and faitDhfull Miniſters in Eſſex, and other places where the Patronage of Church-livings appertaineth to yr Honour, is the ſeaie of your Faithfulnes in this reſpect. The greater is the glory of this kind of piety, becauſe therin you do patriſſare, tread in the ſteps of your worthy Father of bleſſed memory. What infant could not be copious in ſetting out the dignity of this piety, whereby God is ſo much honoured, his Church edified, many distreſſed conſciences comforted, and millions of ſoules ſaved. There is yet further a more particular bond of relation which bindeth me in perſon and paines to yeeld all homage unto yr Honour, that is, the ſmall inheritance I hold within your Lordſhips Royalty at Hadly in Eſſex. Hereto I might adde the benefit of

your Predeceſſours charity on the Free-Schoole at Felſted in Eſſex, where I was trained up three yeares together: and the continuall favours which from your youth you have ſhewed to me, your ſelfe as well as I being trained up at Eaton, and thence comming to Cambridge.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                           MADAM,
                        
                        THere are in this Treatiſe many points concerning Devotion: not unfit for a devout Lady: ſuch an elect Lady as S. Iohn dedicated his Second Epiſtle unto: a Lady whom all that knew the truth loved in the truth, and for the truths ſake: a Lady whoſe children walked in the truth: an evidence that the Lady who loved the truth her ſelfe, was carefull to communicate that to her beloved children, which ſhe had found to be ſweet and comfortable to her own ſoule. And this for the Mothers honor doth the Apoſtle there mention. I that have long knowne your Honour (even from the child-hood of your

now well grown daughters, two worthy Ladies, and beene acquainted, as with your religious care in their good education, ſo with your owne pious courſe of life, wherin I make no queſtion but that ſtill you continue) could not omit ſo faire an opportunity of teſtifying that duty which I owe you. Hereby that which is made publique for the view of all, is in ſpeciall dedicated to your Honour, that having a particular intereſt therein, you may be more diligent in peruſing it. The principall points herein handled, which may beſt whet on your pious devotion, concerne Prayer, the Manner of performing that Heavenly duty, the Power and Efficacy thereof, when it is made in faith, and

the benefit of perſevering therein, at leaſt ſo long as juſt occaſion giveth occaſion of perſisting without fainting. Theſe and other like points are handled in this Treatiſe, which may be (as I ſuppoſe) uſefull to your devout mind.
                     
                  
                  By theſe and many other enducements hath he beene emboldened to tender this ſmall evidence of much reſpect to your Honours, who, as he humbly craveth a gracious acceptance, ſo he faithfully promiſeth to continue at the Throne of Grace
                  
                     Your Honours Sollicitour, WILLIAM GOVGE.

                     SIR,
                  
                  
                     YOur owne Worth, The publike good Service which you have done to this State, The true Zeale which to the Honour of God, and Good of his Church you have on all occaſions manifeſted, do all challenge all the honour that can be done to a man of ſuch deſert. The ancient acquaintance which hath beene even from your childhood betwixt you and me, The entire familiarity that was betwixt us while we were Students in Cambridge, The Continuance thereof by mutuall

Latine Letters about Scholaſticall diſputes, (Bono enim literarum eadem ferè abſentes, quae ſi coram eſſemus conſequimur) when we Cic Epiſt. Famil. were parted, And finally, the many favours which in this time of acquaintance you have ſhewed me, doe, in ſpeciall require of mee all gratefull remembrance. For, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Wherefore having here an opportunity of giving publique teſtimony of the high eſteeme I have of you, and of the reverend reſpect I beare to you, I doe moſt willingly take it.

True it is, that in regard of your noble birth, your eminent dignity, your excellent endowments, there is betwixt us (to uſe the Ariſt. Ethic. Lib. 5. 
                     Philoſophers phraſe) 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                     . His Aphoriſme may fitly be applyed to friends, who though in ſundry reſpects they be unequall, yet unequall things to them become equall. To this tends that which Saint 
                     Hier. Comment. in Mic 7 
                     Hierom hath taken from the Oratour, Amicitia pares aut accipit, aut facit. In confidence of your true friendly minde to mee, I have made bold to teſtifie mine to you, and that by prefixing your

noble name before this Sermon of The Extent of Gods Providence. In regard of the ſmalneſſe of it, it is indeed but as a little Pamphlet, and (as here publiſhed) but an Appendix to a larger Treatiſe; Yet a Treatiſe dedicated to your right honourable Kinſeman, the Earle of Warwick: and in that reſpect I ſuppoſe it may be the better taken. The manner of ſetting out that divine matter of Gods Providence, is according to my accuſtomed manner, very plaine. But I remember a Proverbiall ſpeech in uſe among the Iewes, noted by Druſius that great Hebrician, to bee Ioh Druſ Sent, vet. Sapient. among the Aphoriſmes of loſes the ſonne of Iudas (which, I am perſwaded, you alſo have read)

The occaſion of this Sermon (which was a Downefall of Papiſts too audaciouſly gathered together to heare a Ieſuited Prieſt preach) is remarkable. The like (I ſuppoſe) hath not in our dayes beene heard of. Remembrances of divine Iudgements are uſefull to Gods Church as well as Memorials of his Mercies. To this purpoſe that Adage which the fore-mentioned Druſius attributeth to Simeon the ſonne of Gamaliel, 
                     Ioh Druſloc. citat. is not impertinent. It is this

                              THE hiſtory of the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe is a viſible repreſentation of Gods governing his Church in this world. The Apoſtle therefore having culled out ſundry choice inſtances, maketh this inference upon them, Theſe things were our examples. 
                              1 Cor. 10. 6.—11. And this, Theſe things hapned to them for enſamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come. Wherefore, as other hiſtories of holy Scripture, ſo theſe eſpecially, are to be read and heard, not as meere records of ancient times, but as preſidents wherein we may learne what God expects of us, and what we may expect of him.
                           Among other particulars, the hiſtory recorded in the

latter part of the 17. chapter of Exodus, from the beginning of the 8. verſe, to the end of the chapter, is very remarkable in it ſelfe, and very ſeaſonable for our times, wherin ſo many Amalakites aſſault the Iſrael of God.
                           The Summe of this hiſtorie is

                           As his name was, ſo washe. The name Amalek hath a double notation applied to it. The firſt is this, a ſmiting people. The other, which is given by an ancient Father, is this, A King of the wicked. That which ſhall further be ſpoken of Amalek, will give evidence to both theſe notations, and demonſtrate that he was a ſmiting people, and a King of the wicked.
                           
                           
                              Amalek (as alſo Iſrael) is a collective word: it compriſeth under it the poſterity of Amalek, even that people, that nation that deſcended from him. Now Amalek, the man that was the firſt head, and ſtock of this diſtinct nation, from whom the name was primarily taken, was Eſaus grand-child, or nephew, For Amalek was the ſonne of Eli

                              pkaz, and Eliphaz the ſonne of Eſau, and Eſau the ſonne of Iſaaek, and brother of Iaakob, who was alſo called Iſrael. So as the Amalakites were within three degrees of the ſame ſtock whereof Iſrael was.
                           1. Ob. The poſterity of Eſau were called Edomites. How then can the Amalakites be thought to come from Eſau? 
                              Gen. 36. 8, 9.—25. 30.
                           
                           
                              Anſ. The legitimate poſterity, ſuch as were borne of his

wives, or his ſonnes wives, were indeed called Edo mites. But Amalek was the ſonne of Eſaus ſonne by a concubine: Gen 36. 12. and therefore ſevered from Eſaus ſtock: ſo as he himſelf was counted head of a ſtock.
                           2. Ob. Moſes maketh mention of the Amalakites above Gen. 14. 7. an hundred yeares before Amalek the ſonne of Eliphaz was borne.
                           
                              Anſ. Moſes uſeth that title Amalakites by way of Anticipation: 
                              
                                 De exemplis anticipationis tum nominum tum rerum, vide Prolegomina Perkinſt praefixa Harmoniae Bibl. which is to give that name to a place, or to the Inhabitants of a place, whereby they were called, when the hiſtory that maketh mention of them was written, though at that time whereof the hiſtory writeth they were not ſo called. Now Moſes lived long after Amalek was borne: and becauſe the poſterity of Amalek in Moſes his time lived in that country which Cheder. laomer and the Kings which were with him, deſtroyed, he ſaith that they destroyed the country of the Amalakites; that is, the Country where the Amalakites afterwards dwelt. Kadeſh is ſo named in that place. Gen. 21. 14, 31 Such figurative phraſes are frequent in Scripture.
                           It remaines then that the Amalakites and Iſraelites came all from Iſaak: ſo as in relation to him they were of the

                              1. They were the firſt that enemie-like ſet upon Iſrael, after their eſcape out of Egypt thorow the Red Sea. This Balaam acknowledgeth where he ſaith, Amalek was the first of the nations, meaning (as our laſt Engliſh Tranſlators have noted in the margin of that place) The firſt that warred against Iſrael.
                              
                              2. They could not long keepe in their malicious mind againſt Iſrael: for before the third moneth of their being in the wilderneſſe they aſſault them.
                              3. They ſet upon Iſrael without any cauſe, or provocation on Iſraels part. Iſrael had not as yet taken armes Exo 19. 1. againſt any.

                              10. Haman that cruell enemy of the Iewes, who ſought utterly to root out the whole nation, was an Amalakite. For Eſt. 31. their Kings were called Agag, as the Egyptian Kings, Pharaoh. Hereupon is Haman ſtiled an Agagite, who was an Amalakite.

                           Theſe evidences do ſufficiently ſhew what malice Amalek

                              6. The Amalakites had forſaken the God of Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob, whom Iſrael ſtill profeſſed: and ſo were of a contrary religion.

                              Inveterate hatred is hardly ſatisfied. It endeth not with a mans life, but is oft propagated to poſterity. Amalek received it from his grand-father Eſau and propagated it to his poſterity. The forementioned inſtances give abundant proof hereof. The like may be exemplified in the other branch of

                              Eſaus poſterity, the Edomites; and in the Iſhmaelites and Hagarens, the of ſpring of Hagar, Abrahams concubine: Pſal. 83. 6, 7. Ier. 48. 27.—49. 1. Ezek. 25. 3, &amp;c Am. 1. 11, 13. Obad 10. Zeph. 2. 8, 9. and in the Moabites and Ammonites, the progenie of Lot. The Prophets are full of expoſtulations and exclamations againſt all theſe, for their bitter hatred againſt Iſrael, manifeſted by all the occaſions that they could take of doing any miſchiefe unto them. Though there was a nearer propinquity betwixt all theſe and the Iewes, then betwixt them and other nations, yet their hatred was more againſt the Iewes then againſt any other nation; ſo as they were ready to joyne with others againſt the Iewes, and when by others the Iewes had beene overthrowne and captivated, they would inſult. How implacable and inſatiable was the hatred of the Prieſts, Scribes, Phariſies, and other Iewes againſt Chriſt and his Apoſtles? To omit the many inſtances that for proofe hereof might be gathered out of the hiſtories of the Evangeliſts, of the Acts of the Apostles, St. Paul beareth this witneſſe againſt them, They killed the Lord Ieſus, and 
                              1 Theſ. 2. 15. 
                              their owne Prophets, and have perſecuted us, &amp;c. Eccleſiaſticall hiſtories give inſtances of like hatred and malice of others in ſucceeding ages. And we in our age have found wofull experience of as much in the hatred of Papiſts and others againſt us.
                           Wrathfull and revengefull affections, whereof malice and Malice of an increaſing nature. hatred are not the leaſt, are of a ſpreading and increaſing nature: like fire, the longer it continueth (eſpecially having matter to work upon) the further it ſpreadeth it ſelfe, and the hotter it waxeth. But the fore-named affections can never want fuell. Goodneſſe it ſelfe, by reaſon of the malignant diſpoſition of ſuch as are malicious, becomes fuell to 
                                 Semper contra virtutem inſanit malicia. Chryſ. in Gen. 6. Hom 23. The power of Sathan. and depth of corruption in naturall men. the fire of malice and hatred. Theſe fiery affections therefore may fitly and juſtly be added to the number of thoſe things that are never ſatisfied, nor will ſay, It is enough. (Pro. 30. 15.) Eſpecially againſt truth and vertue is malice alwaies mad.
                           Both the power which the God of this world hath over the men of this world, and alſo the deep rooting that corruption

hath taken in the hearts of naturall men, is hereby 
                                 Quid longius à voluntate diu inâ quam malicia? Planè chaos magnum inter nos &amp; illam firmatum eſt in hac parte: cumſemper eum delectet praeſtare beneficia, &amp; ingra'is no bis è contra ſuggerat affectio crudel ſſima &amp; innoxijs velle nocere. Bern. in Quadrag. Serm. 6. manifeſted. That which ſo farre ſpreadeth it ſelfe, which ſo long continueth, which is ſo unſatiable, as we heard malice and hatred to be, muſt needs have faſt and deep rooting. And the fire which is ever and anon flaming forth, muſt needs be blowne up by ſome means or other. Now the Devill is he, that is ready at all turnes, where he obſerveth fire to be, to blow it up. And, where he is ſuffered ſo inceſſantly to incenſe the fire of malice, what can we els thinke but that he there beareth a great ſway; yea that he hath the whole rule? A matter of much humiliation. For what is more contrary to the Divine nature? Surely in this reſpect there is a great gulfe betwixt it and us. For where he is alwaies delighted in doing good, on the contrary, the pernicious affection of malice doth worke in us a deſire to do wrong even to ſuch as are harmleſſe.
                           How wiſe and circumſpect ought we to be, that are of Others malice muſt make us the more wary the Church of God, ſo long as we live in this world, that we give not unneceſſary advantages to ſuch malicious perſons, whoſe wrath is implacable, whoſe hatred is unſatiable? So long as there are Iſraelites in the world, there wilbe Amalakites. So long as there are people that profeſſe the name of the true God, there wilbe malicious enemies that for their profeſſion ſake will worke them all the miſchiefe that poſſibly they can. As there is a direct contrariety betwixt truth and errour, ſo there is an imbred antipathy betwixt profeſſours and maintainers of the one and the other (as is betwixt the wolfe and the lambe) by reaſon of that malicious and miſchievous diſpoſition that is in enemies of the truth. The neareſt bonds of nature are in this caſe little or nothing regarded. For, the brother will betray the brother to 
                              Mat. 10. 21. 
                              death: and the father the ſonne: and the children will riſe against the parents, and cauſe them to die.
                           
                           Among other reaſons of this immortall fewde againſt worſhippers of the true God, and profeſſours of the true Religion, this is one of the chiefe, that Truth is a light, that diſcovereth the evils that lie hid in darkneſſe. Now the

nearer that ſuch as are of the light are to ſuch as live in darkneſſe, the more conſpicuouſly are their evill deeds diſcovered: which makes them the more fret and fume.
                           What wonder is it, if the like fall out in our daies? Before our daies it was ſo: and after our daies it is like to be ſo, Papiſts to Proteſtants are as Amalakites to Iſraelites. We ſee therefore that no propinquity of country, kindred, neighbour-hood, or the like, can reſtraine their malice, but they are ready to take all advantages they can againſt us. Their profeſſion being palpable Antichristianiſme, this their malice againſt us is an evidence that our Religion is true, and Orthodoxe Chriſtianity: which may miniſter unto us no ſmall comfort againſt their bitter hatred of us.

It onely careth to ſatisfie its owne venomous End that malicious aime at. humour, which (as we heard before) can never be ſatisfied. It is therefore impatient at all delaies. It is ready to take all opportunities of doing miſchiefe, whether they be juſt or unjuſt: whether there be cauſe or no cauſe. And whereas that light of underſtanding which is in men, even as they are reaſonable creatures, might ſomwhat direct them in points of common equity and policy, malice, like a thick cloud, ariſeth before that light, and ſo obſcureth and hideth it, as no direction can from thence be taken. Herein then men offend againſt the light of nature. For the Heathen Philoſophers who had no other light, accounted that

excuſe them. For their anger was fierce, and their wrath was cruell.

The enemies whom David ſubdued, had before his time done exceeding great wrong to Iſrael; that therefore which he did was partly as a juſt puniſhment of their unjuſt wrongs, (for lawfull warre is a publique execution of publique juſtice) and partly as a means to ſecure Iſrael for the time to come from further wrong. Theſe premiſes duly conſidered, it may truly be ſaid that David never began

Of the Philiſtines it is in ſpeciall ſaid, that when they heard that David was annointed King over Iſrael, all the Philiſtines came up to ſeeke David, (2 Sam. 5. 17.) that is, to prevent David by giving the firſt on-ſet, and beginning warre. For God ſo ordered it, that David ſhould not begin warre againſt them, leaſt he might ſeeme ungratefull.
                           By theſe anſwers the difference betwixt warres begun lawfully on juſt cauſes, and unlawfully and maliciouſly upon no juſt ground, may be diſcerned.
                           The application of this point eſpecially concerneth Kings, Princes, States, Generalls, Captains, Souldiers, and all ſuch as wage warre, to take heed that inward paſſion, hatred, malice, undue deſire of undeſerved revenge, or any ſuch like unjuſt and unwarrantable provocation whet them not on to begin warre. They are to be accounted truly valorous, The iſſue of unjuſt war begun. and magnanimous, not who offer, but who protect from wrong. I ſhall afterwards (§ 18.) have occaſion to treat of the juſt cauſes of lawfull warre. In the meane let notice be taken of the ill ſucceſſe that ſuch warres have. Not to inſiſt on this of Amalek, or of other malicious enemies of the

Church, let the wofull iſſue of Ioſiah his going to fight 2 Chro. 35. 20, &amp;c. againſt Necho King of Egypt without any juſt cauſe on Nechoes part, be noted. If God puniſhed this fault ſo ſeverely in ſuch a worthy, ſuch a beloved one as Ioſiah was, who not in hatred, or malice, but upon raſh ſuſpicion, and unadviſed policy went out and fought againſt Necho, how can they, whom malice ſets on worke in like caſes, looke to eſcape the revenging hand of a juſt God? Behold, the righteous ſhalbe recompenced in the earth: much more the wicked and the ſinner: Pro. 11. 31.

bordered next to Iudah, and lay part within him, grew ſo populous and ſo potent, as it got a peculiar name to it ſelfe, which was 1 Sam. 18. 16. 2 Sam. 5. 5. Iudah, and the other ten Tribes retained this name Iſrael. This diſtinction betwixt 1 King. 12. 19, 20.

                              GODS true Church is ſubject to aſſaults in this world. Every age from the beginning of the world giveth too evident demonſtration hereof. Thus much was at firſt prefigured by Cains riſing up againſt Abel, and ſlaying him: (Gen. 4. 8.) &amp; the like hath been verified time after time, even

                           That enmity which is betwixt the ſeed of the ſerpent, and

of the woman, (Gen. 3. 15.) is an eſpeciall cauſe hereof. The ſeed of the one is of a contrary diſpoſition to the ſeed of the other: and there is an inbred antipathy betwixt them (as we heard before, §. 3.) This is not ſo much to be underſtood of the viſible ſerpent, as of the ſpirituall ſerpent, to whom it

                           IIII. THe place where the aſſault is here ſaid to be, was Rephidim. This was the name of one of the places where the Lord was pleaſed that Iſrael ſhould make a ſtation in the wildernes. It was in number the Num. 33. 15. tenth from their comming out of Egypt: but the ſeventh from their paſſage thorow the Red Sea. For they had made three ſtations before that paſſage thorow the Sea. All theſe journies were made within the ſpace of two moneths. For

                               in the beginning of the third moneth after their eſcape out of Egypt, they went from Rephidim to Exo. 19. 1. 
                              Sinai.
                           
                           The name of the place is here expreſſed,
                           1. In generall, to verifie the truth of the hiſtory. For, circumſtances of Perſons, Times, Places, and ſuch like, make much to the confirmation of the truth of an hiſtory.
                           2. In particular, to aggravate the malice of the Amalakites, who ſet upon them ſo ſoone after their comming out

of bondage, before they had time well to ſettle themſelves. For having travelled ten ſeverall journies (whereof one was Exo. 15. 22, Num. 33. 8. 
                              three daies long, others might be as long, if not longer) in the ſpace of two moneths, at the moſt, they could not be long ſetled. Beſides, in their journies they were oft brought to great ſtraits: as at the Red Sea, where Exo. 14. 9. 
                              Pharaoh purſued them furiouſly, and had almoſt over-taken them: and when —15 22. after three daies journey they found no water: and —23. the firſt water that they met with, was ſo bitter, as they could not drink of it. And at another ſtation they —16. 3. wanted bread, and meat, having nothing at all to eat. And after that againe they came to this —17. 1. 
                              Rephidim, a drie and barren wilderneſſe, where were no rivers, ſprings, wells, ponds, or any other ordinary means to afford them water to drinke.
                           Queſtionleſſe the Amalakites dogged the Iſraelites after they were come thorow the Red Sea; and thereupon knew how weary they muſt needs be, and to what ſtraits they were brought, and in particular, how deſtitute of water this Rephidim (the place where they ſet upon them) was. For, the Holy Ghoſt to aggravate their malice, thus ſets it out, 1 Sam. 15. 2. 
                              Amalek laid wait for Iſrael in the way when he came up from Egypt. 
                              Deut. 25. 18. 
                              He ſmote the hindmost of them, even all that were feeble behind them, when they were faint and weary. The immediate connexion of this hiſtory with the former, thus, And Amalek came, (or, as our Engliſh Tranſlatours for more perſpicuity, turne it, Then came Amalek) importeth 
                                 
                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                 
                               as much: For it is as if he had ſaid, Iſrael had now beene wearied with much travell, and diſquieted with many diſtreſſes and wants, and was now in a place deſtitute of all ordinary proviſion, And in this caſe Amalek comes and fights againſt him. An evident demonſtration of much inhumanity, and more then ſavage cruelty.

                              MAlicious enemies are ready to take all the baſe advantages that they can. If the particulars §. 7. noted of Amalek be well obſerved, in him we ſhall find the doctrine verified. The like is noted of the poſterity of theſe Amalakites, 
                              1 Sam. 30. 1, 2 while David and his men were out of Ziklag, the Amalakites ſurprize it, ſmite it, burne it with fire, and carie the women away captive. More baſely dealt the Egyptians with the Iſraelites, when they had them faſt in their own land. For firſt Exo. 1. 11, 13. they afflicted them with burdens, and made them ſerve with rigour, and made their lives bitter with hard bondage. Then they —16. tooke order with the midwives to kill all their male children in the birth. Yea, becauſe the midwives obeyed not ſo cruell a charge, —22. the King commanded all the people to caſt all the male children of the Iſraelites into the river. It was a moſt inhumane, baſe, and barbarous advantage which the Edomites tooke againſt the Iſraelites when the Babilonians had overcome them, and cauſed them to fly hither and thither for their lives, Obad. 14. 
                              to ſtand in the croſſe waies to cut off them that did eſcape, and to deliver up thoſe that did remaine in the day of diſtreſſe. The baſe advantages which Saul ſought againſt David, and the Prieſts, Scribes, Phariſies, and other Iewes againſt Chriſt and his Apostles, and other enemies, heretiques, and idolaters againſt the profeſſours of the Goſpell, eſpecially Papiſts againſt Proteſtants, do further give abundant proofe of the foreſaid propoſition. But, not to inſiſt on particulars, the Pſalmiſt doth indefinitely thus ſet out the diſpoſition of the wicked againſt the righteous, He ſitteth in lurking places of the villages: in the ſecret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily ſet againſt the poore: he lieth in wait ſecretly as a Lyon in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poore: he doth catch the poore when he draweth him into his net. He croucheth and humbleth himſelfe that the poore may fall by his ſtrong ones, Pſ. 10. 8, 9, 10

For theſe are the things that make advantages to be baſe. The mind of him that takes ſuch advantages is a baſe mind: he hath no reſpect to points of honour and honeſty, as was before noted. (§. 4.)

No man, no not among the Heathen, that got the glory of valour, got praiſe by treacheries and malice. They hated treacherie, and all baſe advantages. If any of the adverſe part, offered to act a perfidious part, ſuch was the true valorous mind of ſome of them, as they would returne the perfidious perſon to his owne Lord and Maſter, of him to receive condigne puniſhment. Among others, memorable is the patterne of Curius in this point.

That Romane Captaine, when the Phyſitian of the adverſe King came to him, and promiſed to poyſon his Lord, he ſent him bound back again to the enemy. As memorable is the practice of the whole Senate of Rome in that kind. For when Camillus the Conſul encamped againſt the Falciſci, a traiterous Schoole maſter, who had moſt of the Noble-mens children committed to his tuition, under pretence of carying

them forth to walke, brought them into the enemies Flor, Hiſtor. Rom, l. 1. c. 12. tents, that his countrimen might thereupon bee drawne to yeeld to the enemy. But the Senate of Rome ſo deteſted that treachery, as they ſtripped the treacherous pedant naked, gave rods to the boyes, that they might whip him backe againe to the city which he would have betrayed.
                           Many other like inſtances might be given, whereby generous Generals have ſhewed, that undertaking a triall of 
                                 Qui virtutis certamen ſuſceperat, nollet fraude vincere. Non enim in victoriâ honeſtatem ponebat: ſed ipſam, niſi honeſtate quaeſitam, victoriam turpem pronunciabat. Amb loc. citat. vertue and valour, they would not get the victory by fraud. For they did not place honour and honeſty ſimply in victory, but accounted victory baſe, unleſſe it were obtained by honeſty.
                           This miſchievous mind of malicious enemies, gives juſt occaſion to thoſe that have ſuch enemies (as all true Profeſſors of the true Religion have) to be the more prudent &amp; circumſpect in keeping themſelves from their ſnares and ginnes. On this ground doth Chriſt give this expreſſe charge, Be wiſe as ſerpents, Mat. 10. 16. Many of Salomons proverbs tend to this purpoſe. We have worthy patternes hereof in David, 1 Sam. 20, &amp;c. who wiſely avoided Sauls ſnares; and in the Iewes, Ezr. 4. 3. that returned from the captivity in Zerubbabels time, and in p Nehemiahs, Neh. 4. 9, &amp;c. and ſundry other true ſervants of God. Now becauſe by all the wiſdome that we have, we cannot avoid all their wilie and ſubtill plots, we muſt ever depend upon the Lord, and call on him as David did, to turne their counſell into fooliſhneſſe, 2 Sam. 15. 31. And to Keepe us from the ſnares that they lay for us, and from the grins of the workers of iniquity, Pſal. 141. 9. Or, if we be over-taken, then to pull us out of the net that they have laid for us. Pſal. 31. 4. Thus if we make God our refuge and hiding place, we may be ſure to be ſafe. For they are ſafe whom the Lord doth keepe.

                              Amaleks aſſault here beginneth. Wherein the Externall Means, as they are laid downe in a charge, are firſt expreſſed, and that ſo, as both the Perſons giving and receiving the charge, and alſo the matter given in charge are mentioned.
                           The Perſon that gave the charge was Moſes. (And Moſes ſaid.)
                           
                           
                              Act 7. 35. 
                              Moſes at that time was the Prince, and chiefe Governour over Iſrael. 
                              Exo 2. 10. He was called Moſes becauſe he was drawne out of the waters. For the 
                                 
                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                  
                                 axit.
                               
                              Hebrew root ſignifieth to draw out. Ioſephus the Iew rendreth another reaſon of the name Moyſes; For, ſaith he, the Egyptians call water moy.
                           
                           The Perſon to whom the charge was given was Ioſhua (Moſes ſaid to Ioſhua.)
                           
                           The word whence Ioſhua, or Iehoſhua is derived according to the proper notation thereof ſignifieth to ſave, or deliver. Certainly by divine inſtinct this name was given to the man that is here meant. For children of old received names from their parents by divine inſtinct. They having knowledge of things to come before they were, by Hebrew ſignificant names declared to future ages what they ſhould be after ſome increaſe of age. For this particular perſon Ioſhua, here in this place he was the Generall of that army whereby Iſrael was ſaved and delivered from the Amalakites. And after Moſes death, he was the chiefe Governour and Generall that ſaued Iſrael from the Canaanites, and other nations that were rooted out by him. Wherein he

was a type of Ieſus, whoſe name if it were written in Hebrew, would be the very ſame, namely Iehoſhua. The Greeks therefore for Ioſhua or Iehoſhua write Ieſus, Acts 7. 45. Hebr. 4. 8.
                           At this time, when Moſes gave this charge, Ioſhua was none of the chiefe Princes of the Tribes. For the chiefe Prince of Ephraim (of which Tribe Ioſhua was) was Num 1. 10. 
                              Eliſhama. Indeed —13 2, 3, 8. 
                              Ioſhua is reckoned among thoſe that were ſent to ſearch the land of Canaan, who are called Rulers and Heads: but they were not the chiefe Rulers and Heads, but Exo. 18. 21, 25 ſuch as are mentioned to be made by Iethroes advice, Heads over the people, Rulers of thouſands, Rulers of Hundreds, &amp;c. As for Ioſhua, he was after this, Moſes his Miniſter, Exo. 24. 13. Numb. 11. 28. Yet at this time was he appointed the Generall of the Lords army: partly becauſe of his valour, and partly becauſe of that high calling whereunto he was to be deputed to conquer the Canaanites.
                           
                           
                              Ob. After, this Ioſhua is ſtiled a young man. (Exod. 33. 11. Numb. 11. 28.)
                           
                              Anſw. 1. The latter place may word for word be thus tranſlated, Ioſhua the ſonne of Nun the ſervant of Moſes from his youth: that is, who had ſerved Moſes from his youth.

                           The Matter of the charge containeth in it words of preparation, (Chooſe us out men) and execution, (Go out, fight with Amalek.)

                              I have choſen (or proved thee) in the fornace of affliction, this word is uſed: as alſo, 2 Sam. 6. 1. where it is ſaid that David gathered together all the

                              choſen (or choice, or chiefe) men of Iſrael. This particle (

our good, for the better ſucceſſe to us.
                           The laſt word of the preparation (

                                  See the Dignity of Chivalry §. 3. 
                              men) importeth the kind of men that were to be choſen, namely, ſuch as might truly be called MEN, Valiant and valorous men.
                           
                           The Charge for execution conſiſteth of two clauſes. The firſt, (go out.) He meaneth, out from the congregation of the Iſraelites, or from the camp where they were, into the open field where the enemies were.
                           Two weighty reaſons may be given hereof.
                                 1. To prevent the enemy, and to keepe him from entring in among all the people.
                                 2. To pitch where Moſes (that intended to pray for them) might the better ſee them: that ſo by ſight of them his ſpirit might be the more quickned, and his prayer the more ſharpned.
                              
                           
                           The laſt clauſe of the execution (fight with Amalek) ſheweth the maine action to be done, (fight) and the object or perſon with whom, (with Amalek.)
                           
                           The action is expreſſed in the very ſame word that was § 4. before applied to the enemy; but the circumſtances give evidence that there it is uſed in one reſpect, here in another.
                           
                              1. There for aſſault, here for defence.
                              
                              2. There for offering wrong, here for maintaining right.
                              
                              3. There for an effect of malice, here of juſtice.
                              
                              4. There for an action without good warrant, here with the beſt warrant that can be, Divine precept.
                           
                           Thus the ſame thing for ſubſtance may be done lawfully, or unlawfully. Warre may lawfully be waged: and warre may unlawfully be waged. Circumſtances make much to the goodneſſe or badneſſe of an action.
                           Who are compriſed under this laſt word Amalek hath beene ſhewed §. 2. before.
                           The maine ſcope and drift of this charge is to uſe fit means for preventing that miſchiefe which Amalek yet further intended againſt them. The means was to ſend out a well furniſhed army againſt him.
                           This Charge then commendeth to us ſeven obſervations.
                           
                              I. Princes muſt provide for their peoples protection. 
                              Moſes ſaidSo did Moſes whom God made a Ruler over Iſrael: he provided temporall and ſpirituall meanes. He ſent forth an army, and he himſelfe lift up his hands for Iſraels protection.
                           
                              to Ioſhua,II. Men deputed to weighty works ought to be prepared thereto before hand. Ioſhua was to be the man that ſhould conquer the Canaanites; He therefore is here made Generall forty yeares before.
                           
                              Chooſe us out men,III. Military men must be choice men. The charge here given for chooſing men importeth as much.
                           
                               And go out,IIII. Enemies muſt, as much as may be, be kept out. The charge here given is to go out, namely to meet the enemy before he enter.
                           
                              FightV. Warre is warrantable. It is here commanded by him that ordered his commands by ſpeciall warrant from God.
                           
                              with Amalek.VI. Violence with violence may be reſiſted. Amalek with open hoſtility fought againſt Iſrael: Iſrael therefore is commanded with open hoſtility to fight againſt Amalek.
                           
                           VII. Approved means are to be uſed for attaining our deſired ends. This is a generall doctrine ariſing from the principall intent of this charge, whereunto all the fore-named particulars do tend. Moſes here deſiring to have the Iſraelites freed from theſe miſchievous Amalakites, giveth order for uſing the beſt ordinary meanes, which was by force of armes to vanquiſh them.
                        
                        
                           §. 10. Of Princes protecting their people.
                           
                              
                                 Sicut obedientes oportet eſſe qui reguntur, ſic etiam Rectores &amp; Principes vigilantes eſſe decet. Chryſ. Hom. 34. in Heb. 13.I. PRinces muſt provide for their peoples protection. As they who are under government muſt be ſubject, ſo it becommeth Governours and Princes to be watchfull for the good of thoſe that are under their charge. So was Moſes here: and ſo all good Kings, Princes, Iudges, and other ſupreme Rulers and Governours have beene from time to time. Many have put their owne ſafety in hazzard to ſave their people. Inſtance thoſe who in their owne perſons have gone to warre, and beene Generals themſelves over the

armies which they have gathered together for their peoples protection. Thus have done, not onely Iudges who were extraordinarily and purpoſely ſtirred up to deliver the people, as Othniel, Ehud, Shamgar, Barak, Gideon, Iephthah, Sampſon, and ſuch others: but alſo Kings, both ſuch as were immediately choſen of God, and ſuch as by lineall deſcent came to the crowne, as Saul, David, Abijah, Aſa, Iehoſaphat, and others. Kings of old were wont to be Generalls in warre. In this reſpect it may be ſaid of them, as Iephthah ſaid of himſelfe, They put their ſoules in their hands, that is, they jeoparded Iudg 12. 4. their lives. It was the protection of her people wherby Eſther was moved to attempt that which made her ſay, If I periſh I periſh. It was alſo the like cauſe that made Nehemiah undertake a long journey from Shuſhan to Ieruſalem, Eſt. 4. 16. Neh. 2. &amp;c. and there to oppoſe himſelfe to the envy and malice of the Iewes enemies. That which the Bramble is feigned to Iudg. 9. 16. ſay, is a ſpeech proper to a King, and it properly appertaineth to him to ſay, If in truth ye annoint me King over you, then come and put your truſt under my ſhadow. A King ought to be as a ſhadow under which his people may put their truſt. Read Pſal. 72. 4, &amp;c. Lam. 4. 20.
                           That dignity and authority which Governours have over Governours dignity is for their ſubjects welfare. Deus pro utilitate communi principatus inſtituit. Chryſ. Hom 6. in 1 Tim 6. their people, is not ſimply and onely for their owne exaltation, but for the preſervation and protection of them over whom they are ſet. They are Miniſters of God to them for good, Rom. 13 4. Of David (whom God made King over Iſrael) it is ſaid, The Lord brought him to feed Iacob his people, &amp;c. Pſal. 78. 71. And to Saul (whom the Lord anointed King over Iſrael) it was ſaid, Go, and utterly deſtroy the ſinners, the Amalakites, and fight againſt them, &amp;c. 1 Sam. 15. 17, 18. They muſt therefore feed their people, and fight for them: if not in their owne perſons, yet by uſing their power and authority to leavy armies, to ſend forth armies, to furniſh armies with all things needfull for them, and to give ſuch directions as ſhalbe meet. So did Moſes here, who went not out in his owne perſon: So David, when he ſaw it meet for himſelfe to tary at home, ſometimes he ſent forth Ioab, and
                              
                              all the hoſt of the ſtrong men; other times he ſent forth others, and gave directions what to do, 2 Sam. 10. 7. &amp; 18. 2. &amp; 20. 4, 6. The very order of nature accommodated to the peace 
                                 Ordo naturalis mortalium paci accommodatus, hoc poſcit ut ſuſcipiendi belli authoritas &amp; conſilium penes principes ſit. Aug cont. Fauſt. Manic. l, 22. c. 75. of men, requireth thus much, that the authority and counſell of undertaking warre ſhould be in the power of Princes.
                           Happy are thoſe people and polities that have ſuch Princes; that like Mordecai, ſeeke the wealth of their people, (Eſt. 10. 3.) that preſerve them in peace, that protect them from perill.
                           Pray for ſuch. Be thankfull for ſuch. Be ſubject and obedient to ſuch. Give to ſuch their due. Such are worthy of double honour: and the double honour of maintenance and reverence is to be yeelded to ſuch.

                              MEn deputed to weighty works ought to be prepared thereto before hand. Thus Ionathan, the heire to the crowne of Iſrael, if his fathers wickedneſſe had not forfeited it, was in his fathers time much exerciſed to warre. 1 Sam. 14 4.—31. 2. Becauſe God intended that David ſhould be King over Iſrael, and ſubdue many enemies, his imployments were ſuch before hand, as he could not but be much better thereby prepared to do what he did when he was King. For firſt he had occaſion given him to 1 Sam 17. 34, 48. graple with a Lion and a Beare: then with a Giant: after that with the —18. 27.—23. 5. 
                              Philiſtines, 
                              —27. 8. and the Geſhurites, and the Gezrites, and the —30. 17. 
                              Amalakites. Yea, Sauls fierce perſecuting him was no ſmall meanes to prepare him the better for his kingdome. 2 Chro. 11. 22. 
                              Rehoboam ſhewed himſelfe wiſe in making his ſonne Abijah whom he deputed to the kingdome, Ruler among his brethren. The reaſon that moved Iudg. 8. 20. 
                              Gideon to carry his firſt borne ſonne Iether to the warre, and to put him to ſlay the kings that were taken, was without all queſtion to prepare him for future exploits, and to put boldneſſe, courage, and ſpirit into him.
                           
                              
To this end tend all ſeminaries and meanes of education, as, Schooles, Colledges, Vniverſities, Innes of Court, Incorporations, Companies, and other ſuch like Societies, ſo Artilery and Military gardens, and all ſorts of trainings and exerciſing of armes, yea and ſuch kind of recreations as make men fitter for warre; ſuch as the Olympian and Iſthmian games: and ſhooting, playing at waſters and foines, all manner of fencings, and other like in uſe among us.
                           Preparation before hand enableth men much better to manage matters then otherwiſe they could. Experience makes expert. Of thoſe that came to eſtabliſh David in his kingdome, it is ſaid, that being expert in warre they could

                              Enemies must, as much as may be, be kept out. I ſay, as much as may be, becauſe the power of enemies may be ſuch, as they can not be kept from entring. Before Deborahs time there was Ind. 5. 8. 
                              warre in the gates. And in Hezekiahs time, though he did what he could to prevent the enemy, 2 King. 18. 13, 17. 
                              Senacharib tooke the ſtrong cities of Iudah, and encamped before the walls of Ieruſalem. But if poſſibly they can they muſt be kept out. The phraſes of Luk. 14. 31, 32 
                              meeting an enemy, or ſending to him while he is yet a great way off, uſed by Chriſt in the parable, import as much. So doth alſo the care that wiſe

Princes and States have had in this caſe. Iudg. 3. 10. 
                              Othniel WENT OVT to warre. So did that wiſe and mighty Prince 2 Sam. 8. 
                              David: he fought with many enemies on every ſide: but he went out to them all.
                           The many frontier townes, walled cities, forts, garriſons, and other proviſions againſt enemies invaſions, which prudent Kings have in all ages beene wont to make, do manifeſt their care in keeping enemies from entring among their people. Salomon, though he were a Prince of peace, yet wiſely to prevent the worſt, 2 Chro. 8. 5. 
                              Built cities fenced with walls, gates, and barres. And —9. 25, he had foure thouſand ſtalls of horſes and chariots, and twelve thouſand horſemen, whom he beſtowed in the chariot-cities, that upon all occaſions they might be ready to go out againſt enemies. Though Rehoboam manifeſted much folly in rejecting the counſell of his fathers ſage counſellours, yet he ſhewed more after-wit and wiſdome —11. 5. &amp;c. in building fenced cities in Iudah and Benjamin, and fortifying ſtrong holds, and putting captaines in them, and ſtore of victuall, and ſhields, and ſpeares. The like is recorded of —14. 6, 7.

                           Thus many dangers and miſchiefs are prevented, wherinto people, by enemies entering in among them, might otherwiſe fall.

                           For application of this point,
                           1. The beſt care that can be muſt be taken for good intelligence: that the purpoſes and plots of enemies may be prevented in the beginning before they come to any maturity. Gods care in giving extraordinary intelligence by his Prophet to the King of Iſrael, of his enemies projects, 2 King 6, 8, &amp;c
                              
giveth evidence that it is a point of wiſdome to get by all lawfull means what intelligence we can. The advice which David gave to Huſhai concerning intelligence was not unlawfull,

                               but very uſefull, as the iſſue proveth. David was oft preſerved by that intelligence which he had of Sauls purpoſes againſt him.
                           2. So ſoone as any true notice is given of an enemies purpoſe againſt us, all good ſpeed muſt be uſed to withſtand him. Expedition is a principall point of warlike policy. 
                                 Expedition uſefull.

When the Gibeonites ſent to Ioſhua for ſuccour, this meſſage they ſent, Slake not thine hand, come up to us quickly and ſave us. Ioſhua therefore came unto them ſuddenly, and went all night. Alexander got his many and great conqueſts by putting off no opportunity, nor deferring time. Iulius Caeſar (another great Conquerour) thus expreſſeth his expedition, I came, I ſaw, I overcame. I came to ſuch a place, I ſaw it, and inſtantly ſet upon it and overcame it.
                           3. Leaſt enemies ſhould riſe, and be upon us before we can have intelligence of their purpoſe, or notice of their approaching, it is very needfull to have means to deſcry them before they be among us. The comming of Iehu upon Ioram 
                              Meanes to deſcry enemies afarre off. was very ſudden. Yet by reaſon of the continuall watch that was kept, he was deſcried afarre off. And, had not God raiſed up Iehu to execute vengeance on the houſe of Ahab, ſome miſchiefe might have been prevented thereby.

                              WArre is warrantable. Abundant proofe is hereof given in holy Scripture, (whence all ſufficient warrant for any thing is to be fetched) as appeareth by theſe arguments following.
                           1. Saints not ignorant of Gods will, nor reproved of God 
                                 Illi bella geſſerunt, ut tales victorias appareret Dei volun tate praeſlari. Aug. contr. Fauſt. Manich. lib. 22. cap. 76. in this caſe, have waged warre: as Abraham, Ioſhua, extraordinary Iudges, and the beſt of the Kings, with many others.
                           2. They have asked counſell, and received direction from God for waging warre, Iudg. 1. 1. &amp; 20. 28. 1 Sam. 23. 2. &amp; 30. 8. 2 Sam. 5. 19.
                           3. They have prayed for aſſiſtance herein: their prayers have in this caſe beene heard: and they anſwerably have beene thankfull for ſucceſſe herein, Num. 21. 2. 2 Chro. 14. 11. &amp; 20. 6. Pſal. 18. 1, &amp;c.
                           4. Their wars are teſtified to be waged in faith, Heb. 11. 33, 34.
                           5. God hath of himſelfe (when no prayer hath for that end beene made by man) expreſly commanded his people to fight againſt enemies, Num. 31. 2. Ioſ. 6. 2.
                           6. God hath viſibly ſhewed himſelf a principall party in war and is ſtiled a Captaine of his peoples hoſt, Ioſh. 5. 14, 2 Chro. 13. 12.
                           7. God hath given directions for well waging warre, Deut. 20.
                           8. Part of the ſpoiles taken in war were to be dedicated to God, Numb, 31. 28.
                           9. The Lords holy Prieſts were appointed to go with their holy trumpets unto the warre for the ſouldiers better encouragement, Numb. 10. 9. 2 Chron. 13. 12, 14.

                           12. Battels are ſtiled warres of God, and the Lords Battels, 1 Sam. 18. 17. &amp; 25. 28. 2 Chro. 20. 15.
                           13. God himſelfe is ſtiled A man of warre, and the Lord of hoſts, Exo. 15. 3. 1 Sam. 1. 11.
                        
                        
                           §. 14. Of the lawfulneſſe of warre under the New Teſtament.
                           1. Ob. ALL theſe proofs are taken out of the Old Teſtament, 1. Ob. No proofe for war out of the New Teſtamēt Anſw. which gives not ſufficient warrant to Chriſtians.
                           
                              Anſw. 1. The ground of the objection is unfound. For in many things the Old Teſtament gives even to Chriſtians as good warrant as the New. 2 Tim. 3. 16. 2 Pet. 1. 21. The Old Teſtament is as truly divine as the New. And many things therein contained concerne all ages of the Church to the end of the world.
                           2. The kind of the fore-mentioned reaſons is ſuch as is agreeable to common equity, and muſt in that reſpect be extended to all times.
                           3. Though no particular arguments could be diducted out of the New Teſtament, yet becauſe the Old is ſo plentifull in proofs for warre, the New is the more ſparing. For the New Teſtament uſeth leſſe to inſiſt on thoſe points whereon the Old hath much inſiſted. Inſtance the Sabbath, uſury, removing land-markes, and other the like.
                           4. The Church in thoſe times whereof the New Teſtament recordeth the hiſtory, had no outward ſetled ſtate; but was under ſuch civill Governours as were of a contrary profeſſion, as Heathen Emperours and Lords. No marvell then that the New Teſtament ſpeaketh no more then it doth of warre.
                           5. The ſcope of the New Teſtament is rather to ſet out

the ſpirituall kingdome of Chriſt, and the ſpirituall government of the Church, then civill outward polities and kingdomes of men: and therefore is the more ſparing in this point of warre.
                           6. The New Teſtament doth alſo afford ſufficient warrant Arguments in the New Teſtament for warre. for war: as is evident by theſe following reaſons.

Bernad Mil Temp. c. 3. Vide Aug contra Fauſt. Manich. l. 22. c. 74. When profeſſed Souldiers, who lived on that profeſſion, being powerfully wrought upon by Iohn the Baptiſts miniſtry, asked him (for their future courſe of life) what they ſhould do, he counſels them not to leave that profeſſion, but well to uſe it, to be content with their wages, (Luk. 3. 14.) not to returne their wages back againe. Thus he juſtifieth their calling. For in an unlawfull calling they might not continue, nor receive wages for it.
                                 2.

                                 3. Warres waged in the Old Teſtament are commended in the New, Heb. 11. 33, 34.
                                 4. Michael and his Angels are brought in fighting with the Dragon and his Angels, Rev. 12. 7.
                                 5. The victories which the Church under the New Teſtament ſhall have over her enemies is foretold, Rev. 17. 14. &amp; 19. 19.
                                 6. The Magiſtrates ſword is juſtified. But he beareth the ſword aſwell to ſubdue open enemies abroad, as to puniſh evill ſubjects at home, Rom. 13. 4. With that publique ſword when he ſlayeth a malefactour he is not to be counted a ſlayer of men, but a deſtroyer of evill men, and Chriſts avenger of thoſe that do evill, and a protector of Chriſtians.

                           2. Ob. CHRIST threatneth that All they that take 
                              2. Ob. See §. 20. 
                              the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword.
                           
                           
                              Anſw. 1. That and ſuch like principles concerned the Iewes, and others that lived before Chriſt as much as Chriſtians.
                           2. They all are againſt private revenge. But warre is a publique execution of juſtice.
                           3. The fore-mentioned threatning is in ſpeciall to be applied to the houre, wherein Chriſt would give himſelfe to the power of his enemies, and would not be reſcued by the power of Angels: much leſſe by the ſword of man.
                           4. He would ſhew how his kingdome was protected: not as humane kingdomes, by dint of ſword.
                           3. Ob. We are commanded to have peace with all men.
                           
                           
                              Anſw. That, and other ſuch like precepts are limited 3. Ob. Heb. 12. 14. Rom. 12. 18. with ſuch proviſoes as theſe, If it be poſſible, and, As much as lyeth in you. On our part there muſt be no occaſion of breaking peace, or making warre. Yea if we can on lawfull and meet termes make peace, we muſt do our beſt therein.
                           4 Ob. It was foretold of Chriſtians that they ſhould 4. Ob. Iſa. 2. 4. 
                              beate their ſwords into plough-ſhares, and their ſpeares into pruning-hookes: and that nation ſhould not lift up a ſword against nation, nor learne warre any more.
                           
                           
                              Anſw. Thoſe and ſuch like propheticall phraſes are ſomwhat hyperbolicall; they expreſſe that intire amity that ſhould be betwixt true Chriſtians: and the alteration of their nature by the Spirit of grace. So as the difference betwixt nature and grace is very lively ſet out thereby: to which purpoſe tend thoſe other high tranſcendent hyperbolicall phraſes of the Prophet Iſay, Chap. 11. Verſ. 6, 7, 8, 9.
                        
                        
                           
                           §. 16. Of warring with Chriſtians.
                           5. Ob. TO yeeld that warre may be made againſt Infidels, Idolaters, and other open enemies of the Church, yet may it not be made againſt Profeſſours of the Chriſtian Faith.
                           
                              Anſw. 1. Some that outwardly profeſſe the Chriſtian Faith may be as great enemies to the true Faith, as plaine Infidels. I know (ſaith Chriſt) the blaſphemy of them that ſay 
                              Rev. 2. 9. 
                              they are Iewes, and are not, but are the ſynagogue of Satan. Papiſts profeſſe the Chriſtian Faith, yet are Anti-Chriſtians, the directeſt and deadlieſt enemies that Chriſts true Church ever had. The ten Tribes that with Ieroboam revolted from the houſe of David, profeſſed themſelves to be the people of the true God, the God of Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob, and yet were deadly enemies to Iudah, and the children of Iudah oft waged warre againſt them, and that juſtly and lawfully: 2 Chro, 13, 15 and the Lord helped them therin. What can Papiſts plead more then the revolting Iſraelites could. Papiſts profeſſe the true God, Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt: So did the Iſraelites the God of Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob. Papiſts are baptized: Iſraelites were circumciſed. Papiſts retaine the holy Scriptures; ſo did the Iſraelites, as much of them as was then written. Were it not too great a digreſſion, I could eaſily demonſtrate how Papiſts have much further ſtarted from the true Chriſtian Faith, then the Iſraelites did from the Law of Moſes.
                           
                           2. The cauſe of warre is more to be reſpected then the perſons againſt whom it is waged. If Protestants ſhould give juſt occaſion of warre, warre might juſtly be undertaken againſt them. Before the diviſion of the ten Tribes from the reſt, the reſt of the Iſraelites fought againſt the Iudg. 20. 28. 2 Sam. 2. 13. 2 Sam 18. 7.—20. 6.&amp;c. 
                              Benjamites, and that by Gods advice. David alſo was forced to fight againſt the men of Iſrael that tooke part with Iſh boſheth: and after that with Abſalom; and after that with Sheba the ſonne of Bichri.
                           
                        
                        
                           
                           §. 17. Of the neceſsity and benefit of warre.
                           VVArre is a kind of execution of publique juſtice: and a means of maintaining right. For oft there is ſuch conſpiracy of many men together in doing wrong, and ſo obſtinate and violent they are therein, as by no admonitions, perſwaſions, threatnings, penalties of Law, or ordinary means of executing juſtice they wilbe reſtrained. And ſo inſufferably ambitious are ſome, &amp; ſo inſatiably covetous, as no dignities or jurisdictions will content them, no revenewes or profits will ſatisfie them. Were not ſuch men reſtrained, and ſuppreſſed by force of armes, none ſhould live in quiet, none ſhould poſſeſſe or enjoy any thing beſides themſelves. So as the iniquity of men cauſeth a neceſſity of warre: and the benefit that thence ariſeth cauſeth pious and righteous men to uſe it. By it a free and quiet profeſſion of the true Faith is maintained: peace is ſetled: kingdomes and common-wealths are ſecured: lands and inheritances quietly poſſeſſed: all manner of callings freely exerciſed: good

Quoeſt. ſuper Ioſ. l. 6. c. 10. lawes put in execution: due juſtice executed: ill minded perſons kept under: and many evils prevented. I deny not but by warre the cleane contrary is oft effected, and all things thereby put out of order. But then warre is abuſed. We ſpeake of the juſt and right uſe of warre. For this is in warlike affaires eſpecially to be conſidered, whether the warres undertaken be juſt or unjuſt.

                              Quest. VVHat warres may be counted juſt and lawfull?
                           
                              Anſw. To make a juſt and full anſwer, warres muſt be diſtinguiſhed.
                           1. There have been wars extraordinarily made by expreſſe charge from God. As the wars in Moſes his time againſt Sihon, and Og, and the Midianites, (Num. 21. 21,

33. &amp; 31. 1.) and the warres in Ioſhuahs time. No queſtion muſt be made of them, becauſe they had the beſt warrant that could be, Gods command. If any will make thoſe wars a patterne to root out kingdomes and nations as Moſes and Ioſhua did, let them ſhew the like warrant.
                           2. Ordinary warres are either defenſive or offenſive.
                           
                              Defenſive warre is that which is undertaken to defend Defenſive war our ſelves or friends from ſuch wrongs as enemies intend, or attempt againſt us or them: whether the enemies be forraigne or domeſtique.
                           This warre whereunto Moſes ſendeth Ioſhua, was defenſive, againſt a forraigne enemy which wronged theſe Iſraelites themſelves, and firſt ſet upon them.
                           The warre wherein Ioſhua aided the Gibeonites againſt the five Kings that beſieged them, was defenſive in the behalfe Ioſ. 10. 7. 2 Sam. 3. 1.—18. 7.—20. 6. Offenſive war.

                              Davids warre againſt the houſe of Saul, and againſt them that tooke part with Abſalom, and Sheba, was defenſive againſt domeſtiques.
                           No queſtion can be made of the lawfulneſſe of ſuch wars as theſe are. Neceſſity forceth men thereto.
                           
                              Offenſive warre is when enemies are firſt ſet upon: which according to the cauſes given of offending an enemy, may be as juſt as defenſive warre. The cauſes are ſuch as theſe.
                                 1. Maintenance of Truth, and purity of Religion. This moved the Iſraelites in Canaan to think of making warre againſt their brethren on the other ſide of Iordan, Ioſ. 22. 12. In this reſpect the warres of the Kings of the earth againſt Anti-Christ are commended, Dan. 11. 40. Rev. 17. 16.
                                 2. Recovery of that which is unjuſtly taken away. For this end the Iſraelites in Samuels and Davids time ſet upon the Philistines to recover the cities which they had taken away, 1 Sam. 7. 14. 2 Chron. 18. 1. This alſo was the cauſe of Abijahs war againſt Ieroboam, 2 Chro. 13. 5.
                                 3. Execution of vengeance on ſuch as have done publique

wrong. This reaſon doth God render of ſending Saul againſt Amalek, 1 Sam. 15. 2. For ſuch a cauſe David made warre againſt the Amonites, 2 Sam. 10. 7.
                                 4. Drawing away enemies from ſome dangerous plot that they have in hand. Thus to draw Saul from purſuing David, God ſtirred up the Philistines to invade Iſrael. Thus 1 Sam. 23. 27. 2 Chro. 16. 3. 
                                    Aſa ſet upon Baaſha, to hinder the bulwarks which Baaſha was making againſt Iudah. If Aſa had not diſtruſtfully hired wicked inſtruments, he had done well in his warre.
                                 5. Weakning the power of open and profeſt enemies. For this end David ſet upon all enemies of Iſrael round about. 2 Sam. 8.
                                 
                                 6. Subduing of rebellious ſubjects that gather head, and will not be brought under law. For this end Abel of Bethmaachah was beſieged by Davids men.
                                 7. To helpe and aſſiſt friends and allies in like caſes. So 2 Sam 20. 15. 
                                    Abraham fought againſt them that with other Sodomites had taken Lot captive. Gen. 14. 14.
                                 
                              
                           
                           Provided notwithſtanding that before men enter into warre, whether defenſive or offenſive, all good and faire Cautions in going to war.

Manich. l. 22. c. 74. meanes be uſed, to move enemies voluntarily to do what is juſt and equall. The advice which the Apoſtle giveth about going to law, (1 Cor. 6. 1, &amp;c.) may fitly be applied to going to warre. We have good patternes herein, not onely in the Iſraelites towards their brethren, (Ioſ. 22. 13. Iudg. 20. 12, 13.) but alſo in Iephthah towards the Ammonites, (Iudg. 11. 12.) Yea the directions given in the Law tend much to this purpoſe, Deut. 20. 10, &amp;c.
                           This caution obſerved, in faith may men on the forenamed grounds wage warre. But if nothing beſides the motion of unreaſonable paſſion and anger, or ambition and vaine-glory, or deſire of any earthly poſſeſſion whatſoever, do provoke men to warre, ſurely for theſe cauſes it is not ſafe to kill or to be killed. Souldiers were of old gravely and juſtly reproved for undertaking combats in ſuch caſes.
                        
                        
                           
                           §. 19. Of ſouldiers encouragement in juſt warre.
                           THat which hath beene delivered of the lawfulneſſe of warre cannot but afford matter of much comfort and courage to ſuch as are called to juſt warre. They may on this ground go in faith, with much confidence, cheerfully, and couragiouſly. If there be peace betwixt God and their own ſoules, if they have truly repented of all their ſinnes, if their perſons be juſtified as well as their cauſe warranted, they may not onely call upon God, and that in faith, for his aſſiſtance and bleſſing, and depend on him for the ſame, but alſo undauntedly meet death in the mid-way, and comfortably commend their ſoules into Gods hands. What need he in

Though enemies deſtroy the body, yet no danger comes thereby to the ſoule: neither can they impeach eternall ſalvation. There is much comfort in breathing out our laſt breath in Gods work. It is a kind of Martyrdome. For a ſouldier to die in the field in a good cauſe, it is as for a Preacher to die in a pulpit. Vpon the cautions before noted, this aſſuredly wilbe the iſſue, If a ſouldier get the day, or otherwiſe eſcape with his life, they that ſet him on work are too too ungratefull if they do not abundantly reward him. Herein if man faile, aſſuredly the righteous Lord will not faile. For, whatſoeuer good thing any man doth, the ſame ſhall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free, Eph. 6. 8. In particular, The Lord will certainly make them a ſure houſe that fight the battels of the Lord, 1 Sam. 25. 28. If

O how gloriouſly do ſuch with victory returne from war! how bleſſedly do ſuch as Martyrs die in battell!

                              VIolence may be reſisted with violence. If any courſe may be accounted violent, ſurely war is one of thoſe courſes. To omit the §. 13. Lex talionis.
                               fore-mentioned proofes for the warrant of warre, Deut 19. 21. Exo. 21. 23, 24, 25. the law of requiting like for like maketh much to this purpoſe. Thus dealt 1 Sam. 15. 33. 
                              Samuel with Agag, when he ſaid to him, As thy ſword hath made women childleſſe, ſo ſhall thy mother be childleſſe among women. So dealt. Iudg 1. 6, 7. 
                              Iudah with Adonibezek, whoſe thumbs and great toes they cut off: for ſo had he dealt with 70 Kings. Many like evidences are recorded and juſtified in holy writ.
                           Thus are violent, cruell, and hard-hearted men by a ſenſible demonſtration brought to ſee their perverſe and miſchievous diſpoſition.

                              Anſw. 1. The reſiſting of violence here intended is a publique execution of juſtice: but that which Chriſt forbiddeth is private revenge. The latter phraſe, avenge not your ſelves, is an expoſition of the former.

before you, and aime at them: be well inſtructed in the meanes whereby you may attaine to thoſe ends; and then take courage and reſolution to your ſelves. Deale with wicked men, as wicked men are to be dealt withall: fight againſt them that fight againſt you: with the froward ſhew your ſelves froward, (as the Lord himſelfe doth:) deſpiſe them that deſpiſe you: ſhew as much ſcorne of them, as Pſal 18. 26. 1 Sam. 2. 30. they can do of you.

                              APproved meanes are to be uſed for attaining our deſired ends. The parables which our Lord uſeth about providing that which may be ſufficient for an intended building, and about caſting how to meet an enemy that is comming againſt him, (Luke 14. 28, &amp;c.) give good evidence to the truth of this point. Wherefore ſuch Saints as have beene guided by the Spirit of God, even in thoſe wars whereabout God himſelfe hath ſent them, and to which he hath given aſſurance of victory, have been carefull to uſe meanes. For this end Ioſ. 1. 12, &amp;c. 
                              Ioſhua required all the men of warre that were of the Reubenites, Gadites, and halfe the Tribe of Manaſſeh, that quietly enjoyed their poſſeſſions on the other ſide of Iordan, to go over before the reſt of the Iſraelites, armed to helpe them. On the contrary Iudg 5. 23. 
                              Meroz is curſed for not affording aid to helpe the Lord againſt the mighty. The meanes §. 12. before noted for keeping out enemies tend to the point in hand.
                           Of ſuch uſe are means, as if they be wanting, God will not do the thing that is expected to be done. Though Acts 27. 24, 31 
                              God had given to Paul all that ſailed with him, yet when the mariners

(who are ordinary meanes to adviſe, and helpe in dangers on the ſea) were about to leave the ſhip, Paul ſaid, except theſe abide ye cannot be ſafe. So as ordinarily there is a kind of neceſſity that meanes be uſed. Yea we oft read of meanes uſed in extraordinary matters. Exo. 8. 17. The duſt of the earth was ſtrucke, that out of it lice might ariſe to plague Pharaoh. 
                              —9. 8, 10. 
                              Aſhes of the fornace were ſprinkled into the aire to cauſe boiles to breake forth upon man and beaſt in Egypt. 
                              —17. 6. The rocke was ſtruck with a ſtaffe to make water flow out of it. 2 King 4. 41. 
                              Meale was caſt into the pot, to make the pottage wholſome.
                           The uſe of meanes makes much to the manifeſtation Gods glory in the uſe of meanes.
                              
                                 1. Of Gods providence, in affording meet means.
                                 2. Of his wiſdome, in ordering means fitly.
                                 3. Of his goodneſſe, in bleſſing means.
                              
                           
                           And thus more occaſion is given of calling upon God for his bleſſing on the means which are uſed: and of praiſing him when we ſee the fruit and benefit of means: yea and of humiliation when we obſerve means to be wanting, or to be ineffectuall.
                           1. Ob. 
                              1 Sam. 14. 6. 
                              There is no reſtraint to the Lord to ſave by many or by few, and 2 Chro. 14, 11 Meanes have reſpect to Gods will. 
                              by them that have no power.
                           
                           
                              Anſw. 1. In ſpeaking of meanes no queſtion is made of Gods power. For he that without any means made all things, can do what els pleaſeth him without means. But the queſtion is of his will; whether he that hath ſanctified ſuch and ſuch means, for ſuch and ſuch purpoſes, will effect matters without the means which he hath appointed for effecting them.
                           2. The queſtion is of Gods ordinary manner of working. Now Gods ordinary providence in ordinary matters is the ground of our faith, rather then his extraordinary power.
                           2. Ob. 
                              Iudg. 7. 2, 4. God reſtrained Gideon in uſing the means that in his caſe were ordinarily uſed.
                           
                              Anſw. The Lord tieth not himſelfe to ordinary courſes, God not tied to meanes. as he hath tied his creatures, who can not go beyond the bounds which he hath appointed to them. So as herein

lieth a difference betwixt the Creatour and creatures. For the manifeſtation of this difference it pleaſed God ſomtimes to do great matters with ſmall meanes, (yea and Exo. 17. 28. with no meanes at all,) and to cauſe thoſe particulars to be recorded, that all ages might know what of himſelfe he is able to do.
                           3. Ob. Means uſe to draw mens minds from God: and Abuſe of means. to make them dote too much on means.
                           
                              Anſw. That is the abuſe of means. Means are by ſuch conſidered onely in themſelves, and not in the principall agent who makes them effectuall. Such were the Iſraelites, to whom the Prophet thus, Iſa. 31. 1. 
                              Woe to them that go downe to Egypt for helpe, and ſtay on horſes, and truſt in chariots becauſe they are many, and in horſemen becauſe they are very ſtrong: but they looke not unto the holy one of Iſrael, neither ſeeke the Lord. Thus they ſevered things, which were to be joyned together, God and means: means being the hand of the divine providence whereby he worketh ſuch and ſuch things. 
                                 Quamvis credamus in Deum, faciamus tamen quae facienda ſunt ab hominibus in praeſidium ſalutis, ne praetermittentes ea Deum tentare videamur. Aug. Quaeſt ſuper Gen l 1. c. 102. Means therefore (in the right uſe of them) give occaſion of beholding God, of calling on him, and praiſing him. Daily food, apparell, ſleepe, works of our calling, and other like meanes wherby we are ſuſtained, work ſuch effects in thoſe that are piouſly minded. Wherefore though we believe in God, yet let us do thoſe things that are to be done by man for our ſafety, leſt letting ſlip ſuch means we may ſeeme to tempt God.
                           It will therefore be our wiſdome in every thing that we take in hand,

                                 2. To be diligent in uſing thoſe means. Many promiſes Pro. 10 4.—12. 11. are made to the diligent, eſpecially in Salomons Proverbs.

great ſecurity. To relie only on means is an extreme in the exceſſe, implying too much inſolency. God is tempted both waies. The middle therefore is the beſt and ſafeſt courſe, which is, in the uſe of meanes to relie on God for his bleſſing.

Signum prore ſignificatâ. ſignified thereby, which is prayer. For ſtanding was of old an uſuall geſture of prayer. It never was the onely geſture. For the Scripture expreſſeth many other: whereof ſome were geſtures of the whole body; others of particular members thereof.
                           There are three eſpeciall geſtures of the whole body. 1. Standing. 2. Bowing. 3. Proſtrating, or lying all Geſtures of prayer. along.

                                 2. §. 23. 1. Bowing.
                                    Bowing was uſed as an action of much reverence: and that for the moſt part, when they teſtified their thankfull acceptance of ſome ſpeciall favour. Read for this Exo. 4. 31. &amp; 12. 27. 2 Chro. 29. 29, 30. Neh. 8. 6.
                                 3. Proſtrating, or lying all along teſtified much humiliation, and dejection of the ſoule. Read for this, Ioſ. 7. 6. 2. Proſtrating. 2 Sam. 12. 16. Ezra. 10. 1. Mat. 26. 39.
                              
                           
                           The geſtures of the particular parts of the body are many more: as,
                                 1. Lifting up eyes. This giveth evidence of our expectation of helpe from above: and of our faith fixed on him 3. Lifting up eyes.

Lifting up hands. and David expreſſing prayer by this phraſe, addeth the reaſon thereof, thus, I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence commeth my helpe, &amp;c. (Psal. 121. 1, 2. &amp; 113. 1, 2.) Herein lieth an apparent difference betwixt man and other creatures. For where other creatures looke downeward, mans countenance is made more erect. And where other creatures have but foure muſtles in their eye, man hath a fift to lift the eye upward.
                                 2. Lifting up hands, or ſpreading them abroad. Hereby we manifeſt that we can find no ſuccour in our ſelves: but are ready to receive it from him on whom we call, and to whom we ſtretch our hands. Thus Salomon in his ſolemne prayer, ſpread forth his hands towards heaven, and under this phraſe ſetteth out the prayer of others. (1 King. 8. 22, 38, 54.) So doth David, (Pſal. 141. 2.) and Ieremiah, (Lam. 3. 41.)
                                 3. Casting downe eyes. This teſtifieth an holy ſhame, and 5. Caſting downe eyes. confuſion of face by reaſon of a mans unworthineſſe, and unfitneſſe to appeare in Gods ſight. Take inſtance hereof in the penitent publicane, (Luk. 18. 13.) and in devout Ezra, Ezr. 9. 6.
                                 4. Knocking the breast. Contrition of heart, and compunction 6. Smiting breaſt. of ſpirit, godly ſorrow and griefe is hereby manifeſted. In ſuch reſpects the fore-named Publican is ſaid to ſmite his breaſt, Luk. 8. 13.
                                 5. Renting clothes, pulling haire off the head and beard: 
                                    7 Renting garments, &amp;c. theſe are geſtures which Ezra uſed, (Ezr. 9. 3, 5.) to which may be added the penitent womans teares, with which ſhe waſhed the feet of Chriſt, and her wiping them with the haire of her head, Luk. 7. 38. Deep apprehenſion of ſin, and much aggravation of griefe is by theſe and other like unuſuall geſtures declared.
                                 6. Kneeling. This is the moſt uſuall and proper geſture for prayer. For examples, read 2 Chro. 6. 13. Ezra 9 5. 8. Kneeling.

Comment. lib. 2, in Eph. 3. The very act of prayer is implied under this geſture, Eph. 3. 14. Pſal. 95. 6. That homage which we owe to God, that reverend reſpect which we beare to him, that honour which we deſire to yeeld to him is hereby teſtified.

                           FRequent mention is made of ſtanding at prayer. For proofe whereof, among others, take notice of theſe 9. Standing. Stantes oramus quod eſt ſignum reſurrectionis. Aug. Ianuatio Epiſt. 119. Et de Serm. Dom. in monte

                           In many reſpects doth this geſture well become the divine exerciſe of prayer.
                                 1. It is a reverend manner of preſenting ones ſelfe to God.
                                 2. It is an outward means of raiſing mens hearts and thoughts from earth to heaven. For in this kind of geſture is the head raiſed furtheſt from the earth, neareſt to heaven. It is not ſo in bowing, ſitting, kneeling, lying.
                                 3. It is a teſtification of our acknowledgement of Gods Soveraignty, authority, and dignity. Therfore among men, inferiours ſtand before them under whoſe command they are, 1 King. 3. 16. &amp; 10. 8. Dan. 7. 10.
                                 4. It is a ſigne of ſtedfaſt faith in prayer. It is oft put for a geſture of ſteddineſſe: and oppoſed to leaning, wavering, reeling, 1 Cor. 16. 13. Eph. 6. 13, 14.

1. That he would preſent himſelfe before the throne of God for them.
                                 2. That he would elevate his heart, and lift up his deſires to heaven.
                                 3. That he would do what he did with due reverence, and reſpect to Gods excellency and ſoveraignty.

                           Thus he ſheweth that on his part he would not be wanting to do what belonged to him, that they might be the more ſtirred up to do on their part what belonged to them, and that all might with the ſtronger confidence expect a good iſſue. Therefore this he profeſſeth to do before hand, thus, (as our Engliſh tranſlates it) I will ſtand. Or, (to turne it word for word)

                           This geſture of ſtanding being proper to prayer, ſheweth what they may do who are ſo thronged as they cannot kneele. They may ſtand. So as it taketh away their pretext who in ſtrait pewes ſit at prayer, becauſe forſooth they cannot kneele. But I conceive that where a man can ſit, he may much better ſtand.

plaine, and there Ioſhua went out againſt them. But Moſes

                                 3. That he might be the more quiet and free from diſturbance and diſtraction, (which he could not have beene, if he had remained in the plaine among the people: or if he had been in the army.) For when we ſet our ſelves to prayer, we muſt ſet our ſelves therto with the whole heart Therefore in time of prayer we may uſefully ſeeke ſecrecy of place.

That by the open ſight of heaven, his ſpirit might be the more cheared, his thoughts more elevated, and ſo his prayer the more ſharpned, and his faith the more ſtrengthened.

                           MVch is ſpoken of the rod here mentioned. But what kind of rod it was, is not agreed upon by all.

                               A bed, whereupon a man lieth and reſteth himſelfe, is ſignified by a word which commeth from the ſame root, and hath the

very ſame letters, though not the ſame points: wherein the LXX being ſomwhat miſtaken, do tranſlate the Hebrew word that ſignifieth a bed, by a Greeke word that ſignifieth a ſtaffe: which gave occaſion to that ſeeming difference betwixt Moſes and him that wrote the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes, about Iſraels bowing himſelfe

For, being an old man and weake, he was faine to have a ſtaffe to reſt on, and leaning thereon, he bowed towards the beds head. By the fore-named notation, and uſuall acceptation of the word it appeareth that that which is here tranſlated a rod, was not a wand, (as ſome would have it) or a riding ſtick: ſuch rods are not to be leaned upon: Iſa. 10. 15.

The firſt time of mentioning the rod here ſpoken of, was when Exo 3 1.—4. 2. God appeared to Moſes as he was keeping ſheepe. Whence ſome (and that not without probability) do gather, that this, which is tranſlated a rod, was a ſhepheards crooke. But were it a ſhepheards crooke, or a ſtaffe, or a wand, in regard of the uſe that we may make thereof, all is as one. This is it whereof God ſaid to Moſes, 
                              Exo 4. 17. 
                              Thou ſhalt take this rod in thine hand wherewith thou ſhalt do ſignes.

                           It is alſo Exo. 7. 9, 12, 19.—8. 16, 17. ſometimes called Aarons rod, becauſe God appointed Aaron to uſe it in working the firſt miracles that were wrought in Egypt. And it was moſt uſually ſtiled —9. 23.—10. 13.—14. 16.—17. 5.

                              2. The Perſon that promiſeth to pray being one of thoſe that taried at home, and went not out to the war, giveth inſtance, that,
                                 II. Prayer for good ſucceſſe in warre is to be made by ſuch as tarry at home.
                                 
                              
                              3. The phraſe whereby the thing promiſed is expreſſed (will ſtand) being an externall geſture of prayer, ſheweth, that,

                              4. The Time prefixed (to morrow) being before the battell was ended, declareth, that,

                              7. The Rod which he taketh with him, being the rod of God, wherewith God had before wrought many wonderfull works, importeth, that,

                              8. The Manner of uſing it, by holding it in his hand, namely to this end that Ioſhua and other ſouldiers might ſee it, intimateth, that,
                                 VIII. Perſwaſion of others prayers addeth much courage in dangerous imployments.

                              PRayer must be added to other preparations. When Gen. 32. 6, &amp;c 
                              Iacob heard that his brother Eſau was comming againſt him with 400 men, he tooke the beſt order that he could either by preſents to pacifie his brother, or, if ſome of his company were ſlaine, yet to make an eſcape with others: but withall he prayeth to God for protection, yea in prayer he wreſtled till he prevailed. Iudg. 11. 29, 30. 
                              Iphthah leads out againſt the Ammonites a well furniſhed army: yet voweth a vow unto the Lord. Now a vow is an evidence of earneſt prayer. Though his particular vow be not to be juſtified, yet his

manner of going to warre is commendable. Samuel doth,1 Sam. 7. 5, &amp;c as Moſes here, he gathereth Iſrael together to fight againſt the Philiſtims, and promiſeth to pray for them. The 2 Sam. 23. 8, &amp;c. number of worthies, and the —24. 9. multitude of valiant Souldiers that David had, beare witneſſe to his prudence in preparing externall means: and his many Pſal. 7. 1, &amp;c.—25. 2, 19, 20.—44. 1, &amp;c. prayers recorded in the Pſalmes, give evidence of his piety in ſeeking helpe of God. 2 Chro. 17. 12, &amp;c.—20. 3. Very much is ſpoken of Iehoſaphats great preparations: yet when he heard of the approach of enemies, by faſting and prayer he ſought helpe of God. So many other faithfull Saints. After that the Apoſtle had exhorted Chriſtians to be ſtrong in the Lord, and to put on the whole armour of God, wherwith he ſheweth how a Chriſtian may be armed from top to toe, he addeth this exhortation, Eph 6. 10, 18 See The whole armour of God, on Eph. 6. 18. § 1. 
                              Pray alwayes with all prayer, &amp;c.
                           Means without Gods bleſſing are of no uſe. Pſal. 127. 1. 
                              Except the Lord build the houſe they labour in vaine that build it: Well therefore ſaith the Pſalmiſt, —44. 6. 
                              I will not trust in my bow, neither ſhall my ſword ſave me. But See The whole armour of God on Eph. 6. 18 §. 18, 22. prayer is that which God hath ſanctified for obtaining his bleſſing, and his helpe. To this purpoſe is prayer exceeding, powerfull. It hath alwayes (if at leaſt it were made aright) obtained victory.
                           What now may we judge of them that thinke prayer then only needfull when other means faile? To ſay the leaſt of them Reprehenſion of ſuch as ſeparate prayer and other meanes. they ſhew thēſelves apparently ignorāt of the ſupreme power of God in ordering means: which are ſo ſubordinate to the divine providence, as without it they are of no uſe at all: and withall they ſhew very little zeale of Gods glory. For were there not an abſolute neceſſity of prayer, and that in regard of ſome benefit to themſelves, it appeares that prayer as it is a part of Gods worſhip, and a means to ſet out Gods honour, ſhould never be made by them.
                           If in this caſe neglect of prayer be ſuch a point of impiety, what is it to enterpriſe war with masks, enterludes, playes, and ſuch kind of ſports? Can a bleſſing be expected in ſuch courſes?
                           Set this patterne of Moſes before you, all of all ſorts.

Whether other means faile or abound, let not this of prayer

This makes other preparations ſucceſſefull. Let therfore all armies be ſent forth by Chriſtian Princes with more then ordinary prayer. Thus may we in greateſt diſtreſſes be ſure of ſuccour. For there is nothing ſo hard but with Gods helpe it may be made eaſie. On him therefore let us depend: of him let us ſeeke helpe, and ſo accompliſh our purpoſes.
                        
                        
                           §. 28. Of their care who tarry at home to pray for them that go to warre.
                           II. See §. 26. 
                              PRayer for good ſucceſſe in warre is to be made by ſuch as tarry at home. So did 1 Sam 7. 9. 
                              Samuel. 
                              —4. 13. 
                              Elies waiting for newes out of the army, implieth that his prayer was not wanting. Pſal. 60. That ſolemne forme of thanks which David gave to God upon Ioabs returne with victory, giveth proofe of his praying for the armies. Gen, 14. 20. So doth Melchizedechs congratulation of Abrahams victory.
                           1. Gods honour is engaged in the ſucceſſe of ſuch as profeſſe Gods truth.
                           2. Their cauſe ought to be accounted a common cauſe of all that are of the ſame profeſſion.
                           3. Chriſtian ſympathy, and the Communion of Saints ſhould make us account others dangers, and others ſucceſſe as our owne.
                           4. If they which go out to warre, be of our owne country or nation, by their overthrow we incurre hazzard: by their victory the more ſafety is brought to us that tarry at home, yea we all partake of the benefit of the ſpoiles which they make of enemies, the whole kingdome is enriched thereby if they be great.
                           If theſe be not ſufficient motives to enforce the equity of the fore-named duty, what can be ſufficient?
                           Remember therfore what Vriah ſaid, The Arke, and Iſrael, 
                              2 Sam. 11. 11. 
                              and Iudah abide in tents, and my Lord Ioab, and the ſervants
                              
                              of my Lord are encamped in the open fields, ſhall I then go into my houſe to eate and to drinke? He, when he was at home was as much affected with the armies in the field as if himſelfe had beene there. Can any then be ſo careleſſe of them as not to pray for them?
                           Aſſuredly, if Magiſtrates, and Miniſters, if great ones, and meane ones were more conſcionable in performing this duty, better ſucceſſe might be expected. But ſo farre are moſt from obtaining a bleſſing upon the armies that go forth, as rather on the contrary (Achan like) they trouble the armies Ioſ. 7. 1. 25. that are ſent out, by provoking Gods wrath againſt them, thorow their impiety, and prophaneſſe, lewdneſſe, and licentiouſneſſe. Such either pray not at all: or they make their prayers to be an abomination to the Lord. For, he that 
                              Prov. 28 9. 
                              turneth away his eare from hearing the Law, even his prayer ſhalbe abomination. Thus wicked perſons are betrayers of ſuch as (out of the places where they dwell) goe to warre.
                        
                        
                           §. 29. Of manifeſting our inward deſire by our outward geſture.
                           III. See §. 26. Flexo corpore mens eſt erigenda ad Deum. Bern. medit. devo c. 6 
                              INward devotion of heart muſt be manifested by the outward diſpoſition of body. As the many geſtures which in Scripture are recorded and approved, being uſed by Saints in prayer (whereof before, §. 22.) do afford good proofe to the point, ſo alſo the manifold expreſſions of prayer by ſundry geſtures proper thereto: as ſuch as theſe, Pſal. 123. 1. 
                              I lift up mine eyes: 
                              Eph. 3. 14. 
                              I bow my knees, that is, I pray. Pſal. 95. 6. 
                              Let us lift up our hands: 
                              Lam 3. 41. 
                              Let us kneele, that is, let us pray. Pſal. 141 2. 
                              Let 
                              
                                 Animus in geſtu corporis apparet, Geſtus corporis ſignum eſt mentis. Corporis geſtu animus proditur. Bern. de modo benè viv. Scr. 9. Benefits of outward geſtures in prayer 
                              the lifting up of my hands be, that is, let my prayer be. So here in this place, I will ſtand, that is, I will pray.
                           As in other caſes, ſo alſo in prayer, the mind appeareth in the geſture of the body: for this is a ſigne of that. So as by the manifeſtation of our inward devotion by our outward geſture, God is more honoured, others are made like minded, and our owne ſpirits are quickned.
                           
                              
1. For God, he is by that means glorified both in ſoule and body: as we ought in both to glorifie him, 1 Cor. 6. 20.
                           
                              Ob. God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him must worſhip him in ſpirit and truth, Ioh. 4. 24.
                           
                              Anſw. True. But what then? Is he not therefore to be worſhipped in body? Fie on ſuch a conſequence. Indeed God is moſt eſpecially to be worſhipped in Spirit. All outward worſhip without it is altogether in vaine, Iſay. 19. 13. But Gods delight in the ſpirit doth not imply a diſlike, or no liking of a manifeſtation thereof by the body. He that ſaid in regard of an upright manner of performing the things which we do, Take heed that ye do them not before men to be ſeene of them, Mat. 6. 1. ſaid alſo in regard of our zeale to Gods glory, Let your light ſo ſhine before men as they may ſee your good workes and glorifie your father which is in heaven, Mat. 5. 16. What therefore God hath joyned together, let no man put aſunder, Mat. 19. 6.
                           2. For others, our outward geſture manifeſting our inward affection, they may be brought to adde their prayers alſo, and joyne with us, (as they who ſaw the company of Prophets propheſying, propheſied alſo among them, 1 Sam. 19. 20.) or at leaſt ſay Amen to our petitions, and deſire God to grant them, as old Elie did, when he underſtood how Annah had powred forth her ſoule before God, 1 Sam. 1. 17.
                           3. For our ſelves, by the outward geſture of the body our owne ſpirits within us are much affected. For there is a ſympathy betwixt ſoule and body. Bowing the body in prayer, as it teſtifieth the humiliation of the ſoule, ſo it maketh the ſoule to ſtoupe ſomwhat the lower. Beating the breaſt doth ſomwhat the more breake the heart; lifting up eyes or hands raiſeth up the heart; ſpreading the armes abroad enlargeth the deſire of the heart; ſtanding erect maketh the ſoule the more ſteddy. Exhortation to uſe ſeemely outward geſture in prayer.
                           
                           Let us on theſe grounds both declare and helpe the inward faith and fervency, devotion and contrition of our

ſoules by the outward geſtures of the body. There needs no great labour after outward, geſture, if at leaſt there be true devotion in the heart. The parts of the body are ſo commanded by the ſoule, as they will ſoone declare the intent thereof. This is evident by the private prayers which perſons truly devoted do make. For when they are alone, and no creature preſent to take notice of the outward geſture, according to the affection of the heart, when it is indeed fervent, the eyes wilbe caſt up, or caſt downe, the armes ſpread abroad, the hands lift up, or beating the breaſt, the body caſt proſtrate upon the ground, and other like geſtures performed. They who uſe to pray privately and fervently, know this to be true.
                           I urge not this outward geſture, to make men play the hypocrites. Farre be ſuch intents from my mind. Men are too prone to make ſhew of more then is in them: they need no provocations thereto. Beſides hypocriſie is ſo odious in Gods ſight, as it makes our beſt works abominable: Iſa. 66. 3. But that be referred to him who ſearcheth the heart, and knoweth the inward thoughts of men: and to every ones conſcience, that will excuſe or accuſe him. I urge a manifeſtation of inward affection, and that by ſuch outward geſtures as are Geſtures in prayer how ordered.

                              Iſa. 55. 6. 
                              Seeke the Lord while he may be found: call upon him while he is neare. 
                              Amos 4. 12. 
                              Prepare to meet thy God, O Iſrael. Meet him before he is gone, meet him before he have cauſed his wrath to fall. Gen. 32. 9. So ſoone as Iacob heard that his brother was comming againſt him, he makes his prayer to God. He

put it not off to the evening. Yet —24. when the evening was come, and ſo he freed from diſtractions, he returned to prayer againe, and more earneſtly wreſtled with God. 2 Chro. 14 11. Before Aſa began to fight with the Ethiopians, he ſought aſſiſtance of God. So did —20. 3. 
                              Iehoſaphat, and other pious princes. So ſoone as Exo. 32. 11. 
                              Moſes heard God ſpeake of wrath, before he went downe to ſee the cauſe thereof, he fell downe before the Lord, to turne it away: and —31. when he had ſeene the cauſe thereof, he went againe unto the Lord.
                           
                           Thus, much evill may be prevented, which otherwiſe 
                                 De occurrendo periculis in tempore, lege Chryſ. in initio orat. 1. adverſ. ſud. could not be redreſſed. A fire when once it begins to flame out, cannot ſo eaſily be quenched, as it might before hand have beene kept from flaming and burning. A breach, which might with ſmall coſt and paines have beene prevented, when it is made, oft proves irrecoverable. Great was the folly of the Iſraelites in the time of the Iudges, who uſed not to cry to the Lord, till they were ſorely oppreſſed by their enemies. And this was the cauſe that ſometimes they received (when they called upon God) ſuch an anſwer as this, Goe, and cry unto the gods which ye have choſen, let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation. 
                              Iudg 10. 14.
                           
                           O that we were wiſe to marke the opportunity and to take it! Commonly (like fooles) we thinke of our cloakes when we are well wet: and thinke of ſhutting the ſtable doore when the ſteed is ſtolne, or of making our houſe ſafe and ſure from theeves when we have loſt our goods. Many ſeeke not to God till neceſſity forceth them. When the enemy hath got the day, when the plague rageth and hath deſtroyed many, when people die every where for want, then (it may be) ſolemne prayer ſhalbe made, and a faſt proclaimed. Hereby as the folly of men is diſcovered, ſo too juſt cauſe is given for their prayers to be ſuſpected in regard of the ſoundneſſe of them: yea God is hereby provoked to leave men without ſuccour, becauſe they ſought it not in time.

                              ANy place may be fit for prayer. This doctrine is to be limited according to the occaſions of prayer. For, for publique prayer, at leaſt in times and places where liberty is granted to frequent publique aſſemblies, See The whole armour of God, on Eph. 6. 18. Treat 3 §. 84. publique Churches ſet apart for Divine Service, are fitteſt. But where juſt occaſions are offered of praying in other places, in any place may that divine duty be performed. 1 Tim. 2. 8. 
                              I will (ſaith the Apoſtle) that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands. The charge of Luk. 18. 1.

                              without ceaſing, implieth as much. If occaſions of prayer being offred, we forbeare to pray, becauſe we are not in this or that place, thoſe precepts can hardly be kept. But in particular, we read of approved prayers made, as Act. 31. in Churches, ſo —10. 30. in houſes,

Inſtance the fore-mentioned inſtances. His promiſes for hearing prayer are without any limitation of place: ſo as, in any place we may expect the accompliſhment of them.
                           What a dotage is it therefore ſo to dote on any one kind of place, as never to pray but in ſuch a place. Or ſuperſtition blindeth ſuch mens eyes, or prophaneneſſe poſſeſſeth their hearts. It is much to be feared that the prayers which they ſeeme to make in the places which they pretend moſt to affect, are but cold prayers. If the Spirit of ſupplication had'any heat in them, it would be like that hot vapor that is compaſſed in a cloud, or got into hollow places of the earth, which

rather then not find a vent, will rent the cloud aſunder with a thunder-clap, or make the earth to quake. They loſe much holy acquaintance and familiarity with God, that are ſo nice, as not offer to meet with him except in ſuch or ſuch a place.
                           Wiſe Chriſtians will rather ſanctifie every place with this heavenly duty. Their houſe, their chamber, their cloſet, their bed, their table, and other like places ſhalbe ſanctified

By a pious mind well devoted to Godwards, and by a conſcionable performance of this principall duty of piety; it may be ſaid of any place what Iacob ſaid of the place where he ſaw his viſion, This is none other but the houſe of God, and this is the gate of heaven, Gen. 28. 17.

                              KNowledge of that for which prayer is made is an eſpeciall meanes to ſharpen prayer. That which made Gen. 32. 9. 
                              Iacob to wreſtle with God, was the danger wherein he ſaw his houſhold to be. When 2 King. 19. 14 
                              Hezekiah ſaw and read the letter that Senacherib ſent, then was his ſpirit extended to prayer. The knowledge that 2 Chro. 14 11.

                              Nehemiah, and other good Kings and Governours had of the danger of their country, made them earneſt in prayer with the Lord for ſuccour. It is oft noted of Chriſt, that when he ſaw ſuch and ſuch miſeries of people, his bowels were moved, he hand compaſſion on them. In particular, Mat. 9. 36. when he ſaw the people ſcattered without a ſhepheard, he incited his Diſciples to pray for them.
                           Sight and other means whereby we may have true intelligence of the needs and ſtraits wherunto ſuch as we reſpect and affect are brought, work deep impreſſions of compaſſion, which moveth our inward bowels, and after a ſort enforceth us to afford them the beſt aid we can. Now they who know how beneficiall prayer is in all needs, are thereupon

moued as earneſtly as they can to pray for them.
                           To ſtirre us up to pray for thoſe that are in diſtreſſe, let us enquire and take notice of their eſtate and affaires. Nehemiah 
                              Neh. 1. 2. was very inquiſicive after the eſtate of the Iewes that had returned from the captivity, whereby it came to paſſe that he was ſo helpfull to them both by his prayer, and otherwiſe. But what the eye ſeeth not, the heart rueth not. Things not knowne are not regarded. Aſſuredly if we ſaw, or on aſſured knowledge beleeved what the diſtreſſes of many Churches in other places are, and of many perſons in our own country, our ſpirits would ſend forth more prayers for them, then now we doe, (if other ſuccour alſo were not afforded them.)
                           Here, by the way note what wrong they do who bring The ill conſequences of falſe newes. falſe reports to mens eares: as, reports of victory, when people are overthrowne.
                                 1. They to whom the report is brought are deceived, and made to believe an untruth.
                                 2. They of whom the report is made, are by the falſe report deprived of that helpe which otherwiſe they might have had.
                                 3. God himſelf is mocked, in that that which is not done, is acknowledged to be done by him, and ſo when prayer ſhould be made, praiſe is given for that which is not.
                              
                           
                           We have not a mountaine to go to the top of it, and to 
                                 Cur malum fama? quia velox, an quia plurimum mendax? quae ne tune quidem cum aliquid veri affert, ſine mendacij vitio eſt, detrahens, adjiciens, demutans de veritate. Tertul in A polo. get. cap. 8. Solet ſama mentiri. Aug. Bonefac. Epiſt. 106. behold all the battels of the Churches, as Moſes here on the top of an hill beheld the Iſraelites fighting. We muſt have knowledge of forraigne affaires (as Nehemiah had) by report. If that report be falſe, how ſhall we order our prayers? Yet there is commonly ſuch uncertainties in rumors and reports, as fame is ſaid to be an evill thing. For even then when it declares ſome truth, it is not free from the blame of lying, in that it taketh away from the truth, or addeth thereto, or ſome way or other altereth it. It is not therfore without cauſe ſaid, that fame uſeth to lie.
                           Yet if men be not raſh in receiving every uncertaine report, they that with an honeſt heart make their prayers

according to the report which they receive, may have this comfort, that their ſacrifice of prayer is acceptable to God: and that thereby God taketh notice of their diſpoſition, how they would be affected, if it went ſo or ſo with the Church.
                           But for the comfort of ſuch as are in diſtreſſe, howſoever pious and pitifull men may be miſ-informed about their caſe, God is in heaven, and better ſeeth all their diſtreſſes, then Moſes on the top of his hill could ſee Iſraels ſtraits. And whereas Moſes could onely pray for ſuccour, God can give them ſuccour: God, I ſay, who to every drop of compaſſion that is in man, hath in himſelfe an ocean of compaſſion: and anſwerable to his compaſſion hath both will and power to helpe. A point of much comfort.
                        
                        
                           §. 33. Of ſtrengthening faith by Gods former works.
                           VII. See § 26. 
                              COnſideration of Gods former workes is of ſpeciall uſe to ſtrengthen faith. Hereby was Iacobs faith much ſupported, and therefore he thus pleadeth and preſſeth Gods former works, when he was in danger, Gen. 32, 9, 10, 
                              O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Iſaac, the Lord which ſaidst unto me, returne unto thy country, &amp;c. I am not worthy of the least of all thy mercies, and of all the truth which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy ſeruant, &amp;c. So 2 Chro. 20. 7. 
                              Iehoſaphat, 
                              Neh. 9. 6. &amp;c. 
                              the Levites in Nehemiahs time, and many others. This was 1 Sam. 17. 34, &amp;c. Pſal. 22. 4.—77. 11, 12.—143. 5. 
                              Davids uſuall practice. Therefore —105. 5. he exhorts others to remember the marvellous workes which God hath done, his wonders, and the judgements of his mouth.
                           
                           Gods former works give evident demonſtration, as of his power, what he is able to do, (for what he hath ſometimes done he is able alwaies to do) ſo of his will, what he is willing, as he ſeeth occaſion to do. For the Lord never doth what he is unwilling to do. Now evidence of theſe two, Gods power and will, are two ſtrong props to ſupport our faith.
                           
                              
                              Ob. It followeth not that becauſe God ſometimes did How Gods former extraordinary works ſtrengthen our faith. ſuch and ſuch things, he will ever do the ſame. Never did he in any nation the wonders that he did in Egypt and in the wilderneſſe.
                           
                              Anſw. Though he do not by the ſame viſible, extraordinary, and miraculous means ſuccour his Church and People, yet thereby his Church is taught to believe that he ſeeth and obſerveth his peoples diſtreſſes, that his compaſſion is moved thereat, that though in his wiſdome he ſuffereth them to lie ſome time therein, yet it is not his will that they ſhould utterly periſh: and therefore he will aſſuredly deliver them. Thus the Apoſtle preſſing the promiſe which God in particular made to Ioſhua, I will never leave thee nor forſake thee, maketh this generall inference thereupon, So that we, (we Chriſtians that live ſo many yeares after Ioſhuaes time) we may boldly ſay the Lord is my helper, I will not feare, &amp;c. Heb. 13. 5, 6. Though we cannot therefore expect the ſame particular 
                                 Quis eſt qui conſiderat opera Dei, quibus regitur &amp; adminiſtratur totus hic mundus, &amp; non obſtupeſcit obruitur

Ibid. works of God to be done for us, that of old were done for others, yet the generals we may and ought to believe, that that God which provided for, and delivered of old ſuch as truſted in him, is ſtill able, and willing to provide for and deliver ſuch as now truſt in him. Theſe generals expect from God. As for the means and manner of doing it, referre them to his wiſdome. He ever remaineth the ſame God, as in his power, ſo in his will, affection, and compaſſion towards ſuch as truſt in him. He can by ſundry means bring things to the ſame iſſue. If thorowly and adviſedly the uſuall works of God were conſidered, even thoſe whereby the whole world is ruled and governed, who would not be aſtoniſhed, even as at miracles, and by the miraculouſneſſe of them be ſtrengthened in faith? But many turning their faces to the works that are done, turne their backes to him that did them. Whence it comes to paſſe, that neither God hath the glory which belongs to him, nor man that profit which otherwiſe he might reape from the works of God.
                           Gather now, ye that truſt in the Lord, gather what evidences Obſerve Gods former works. ye can by Gods former works of his power, and will.

Oft meditate thereon; plead them in prayer before God. In your catalogue of Gods former works be ſure you leave not out ſuch as are done in your daies, and to your ſelves in particular, whereof upon experimentall evidence you may ſay to God, marvellous are thy works, and that my ſoule knoweth 
                              Pſal. 139. 14. 
                              right well. The works which were brought to Moſes his mind by holding up this rod were ſuch as were done in his daies, before his eyes, by his miniſtry. Such works as are done in our daies, and to our ſelves, make the deepeſt impreſſion: and have the moſt effectuall and mighty operation. Such were they whereby Iacob and David were ſtrengthened Gen. 32. 10. 1 Sam. 17. 56. in their faith. Though we have not ſuch a viſible ſigne of Gods former works, as this rod was which Moſes held up, yet we have as good and ſure ſtaies for our faith to reſt upon. For, we have Gods works recorded in Gods Word, a Word of truth. And we may ſay, as the Pſalmiſt doth, We have heard with our eares, O God, our fathers have told us 
                              Pſal. 44. 1. 
                              what works thou diddeſt in their daies, in the times of old. And God hath in our dayes, and before our eyes done ſuch works, as give us ſufficient ground to truſt in him. We have memories to retaine them. We have minds to meditate on them. We may (if we will) regiſter and record them. What could Moſes his rod do more then al theſe? Though we want that externall ſigne, yet we have the ſubſtance. And by a right uſe of what we have, our faith in God may be ſtrengthened, as Moſes was by the uſe of this rod. Ruminate therfore on Gods bringing in the Goſpell in King Henry the 8 daies. On eſtabliſhing it in King Edward the 6 daies. On the courage, comfort, and conſtancy that he gave to Martyrs in Queene Maries daies. On the reſtoring of the Goſpell in bleſſed Queene Elizabeths daies. On the many victories then given: eſpecially in 88. On the many deliverances from Papiſts treaſons: eſpecially in 605. As occaſion is offered ſeriouſly ponder and meditate on theſe and other like works of God, and thereby ſhalt thou find much vigour infuſed into thy faith. Withall well note the promiſes of God. For, this rod which Moſes tooke up to the hill was a ſigne of Gods

promiſe. Take this rod in thine hand (ſaith God) wherewith 
                              Exo. 4. 17. 
                              thou ſhalt do ſignes. Gods promiſes are the moſt proper ground-worke of faith: as I have

                           VIII. See §. 26. 
                              PErſwaſion of others prayers addeth much courage in dangerous imployments. This was one reaſon why Num. 10. 9. God in his Law ordred that his Prieſts ſhould go with their ſilver trumpets into the armies of his people, that by that ſigne his people might be aſſured of the Prieſts prayers, and be thereby the more encouraged. 2 Chro. 13. 14 Thus were the people in Abijahs time much encouraged. This queſtionleſſe was the reaſon why Iudg. 4. 8. 
                              Barak was ſo importunate to have Deborah go with him to the warre. Her ſex might make him thinke that ſhe was not fit to lead an army, or to fight. But he knowing her to be a Propheteſſe, did alſo know that her prayers would be availeable with the Lord: and withall he thought that the ſight of the battell would extend her ſpirit the more earneſtly to call upon the Lord for them. Did not this perſwaſion encourage him, who ſpeaking of his troubles, ſaid, Phil. 1. 19. 
                              I know that this ſhall turne to my ſalvation thorow your prayer.
                           
                           Gods people being acquainted with Gods Word, thereby know that God is the fountaine of all bleſſing, and that prayer is the means of receiving all needfull bleſſing from him, and that the prayers of others are availeable with God

Commēt. in Rom. 15. as well as their owne, and that when others prayers are joyned with theirs, they are ſo much the more powerfull. How can they then but be the more incouraged by their perſwaſion of others prayers for them. Of craving others prayers, See The whole Armour of God, on Eph. 6. 19. Treat. 3 §. 137.
                           
                           Good cauſe there is for this very cauſe, when any go about any weighty, difficult, or dangerous worke, or when they are in any dangers or feares, to crave the prayers of ſuch as they count faithfull: as 2 King. 19. 4. 
                              Hezekiah did of Iſayah. And for them of whom this duty is deſired, by ſolemne promiſe

to bind themſelves to do it, as 1 Sam. 12. 23. 
                              Samuel did, that ſo they who deſire it may have the more cauſe to believe that it ſhall be performed. And if the worke enterpriſed be publique, meet it is that a faſt be proclaimed, and publique prayers enjoyned for their good ſucceſſe. By theſe publique prayers more notice may be taken of the many prayers that by many perſons are made for them, and ſo they be the more encouraged.
                           By a ſound and good argument from the leſſe to the greater 
                                 A minori. Chriſts interceſſion a ground of encouragement. Meritò mihi ſpes valida eſt in eo qui ſedet ad dextram tuam, &amp; te interpellat pro nobis: alioquin deſperarem. Aug. Confeſſ. l. 11. c 43. it followeth, that they who are well inſtructed in the articles of the Chriſtian faith, and anſwerably do believe in Chriſt, cannot but have much comfort and encouragement in all their lawfull enterpriſes, be they never ſo difficult or dangerous, becauſe they cannot be ignorant that Chriſt, in whom they believe, is on an higher hill then Moſes here was, even in heaven at Gods right hand, making interceſſion for them. Whom, though he be inviſible, they may ſee with the eye of faith, as Moſes by faith ſaw him who is inviſible, He. 11 27. Now Chriſts interceſſion is more then al the praiers of all ye Saints, though their ſpirits were all joined together, in preſenting one and the ſame petition to God. For Chriſts interceſſion is that ſweet incenſe that is in it ſelfe acceptable to God, and that, mixed with the prayers of the Saints, makes them acceptable, Rev. 8. 3, 4. Let us therefore have our eye of faith fixed on Chriſt at Gods right hand in heaven, holding up his hands continually, and making interceſſion for us. The eye of faith may in this kind work as much boldneſſe, as the ſight of Stephens bodily eye did, when he ſaw Ieſus ſtanding on the right hand of God, Acts 7. 55.

                           Out of the two parts of this text naturally ariſe theſe two obſervations.
                                 I. Obedience is to be yeelded to Governours. Moſes was at this time a Prince; the ſupreme Governour over all Iſrael. Ioſhua therefore who was one of Iſrael, and under his command, did as Moſes had ſaid unto him.
                                 
                                 II. They who are ſent by lawfull authority unto a lawfull warre, muſt go. Moſes his charge was a lawfull authority. Warre (for defence of a people againſt a malicious and injurious enemy) is a lawfull warre. Therefore Ioſhua goeth. He fought with Amalek.
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                        
                           §. 36. Of yeelding obedience to Governours.

                              Subjects in relation to ſupreme and ſubordinate Magiſtrates.
                           
                              
The Apoſtle much preſſeth this point, and inforceth it by foure ſpeciall arguments, Rom. 13. 1, 2, &amp;c.
                                 1. The Authour of Government, and Ordainer of Governours. (The powers that be are ordained of God.) Though it be true which the Prophet ſaith, (Hoſ. 8. 4.) They have ſet up Kings but not by me: they have made Princes and I knew it not: namely in regard of particular perſons ſet up, and in regard of the manner of ſetting them up: yet the Power it ſelfe, and Government, is of God.
                                 2. The good or benefit of Government. (He is the Miniſter of God to thee for good.) Governours therefore are advanced to their eminent places, not ſimply for their owne honour, but for the good of their ſubjects. They who rightly and duly ſubject themſelves, procure good to themſelves. Such as are rebellious, are injurious to themſelves.
                                 3. The evill of ſin in reſiſting Government. Whoſoever reſiſteth the power reſiſteth the ordinance of God. He doth therfore offend thereby not men onely, but God alſo, which is a ſinne.
                                 4. The evill of puniſhment following thereon. They that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves damnation. A fearfull doome. Take for inſtance the examples of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, Numb. 16. Vpon theſe and other like grounds Chriſtians are exhorted to be ſubject for conſcience ſake, Rom. 13. 5. and for the Lords ſake, 1 Pet. 2. 13. Both which intend one and the ſame thing. For the conſcience is ſubject to God alone: ſo as that which is done for conſcience ſake is done for the Lords ſake.
                              
                           
                           This for the generall of yeelding obedience to Governours, may ſuffice. For if theſe motives, Gods ordinance, Our owne good, Avoiding ſinne, and, The puniſhment of ſinne, be not ſufficient, what can be ſufficient? I haſten to the particular, of ſouldiers obedience to their Governours charge about going to

                              warre, which is here in ſpeciall expreſſed and intended. For among them diſcipline is moſt neceſſary. Therefore in well ordered armies diſcipline is not wanting, nor obedience deſpiſed.

                                    um ejus qui praeeſt. Bern, ad Mil. Temp. cap. 4. hath beene ſhewed. Lawfull authority, is the commād of ſuch as God hath ſet over us, eſpecially of the ſupreme Governour: which command may come to us either immediately from the governour himſelf, or mediately by ſuch as he ſets under himſelfe over us. For, ſaith the Centurion, I am a man under authority, and have ſouldiers under me, and I ſay to one, go, and he goeth; and to another, come, and he commeth, Mat. 8. 9. A proofe pertinent to the point in hand. For what doth a Centurions bidding a ſouldier, go, imply, but a ſending of him to ſuch or ſuch a ſervice in warre? Ioſhua (22. 2.) for this commends the obedience of the Reubenites, Gadites, and halfe the Tribe of Manaſſeh. Vriah ſo farre obeyed in this caſe, as he loſt his life, 2 Sam. 11. 16, 17. I ſay not this to juſtifie Davids or Ioabs command: but to demonſtrate the extent of Vriahs obedience.
                           Authority is given for this end, to obſerve what may be beſt for the ſtate wherein they have their authority; and anſwerably to order matters. In ordering whereof, there being many caſes wherein the very life of ſome particular perſons is to be put in hazard for preſervation of the whole ſtate, God hath given this power to ſupreme Magiſtrates to appoint whom they ſee beſt, according to that which Moſes ſaid to Ioſhua, Chooſe us out men. If men choſen might refuſe to go, to what purpoſe are they choſen? Souldiers owe

                              Anſw. 1. Going to warre doth not neceſſarily preſuppoſe loſſe of life. Many returne home from warre, not onely with their lives, but also with much honour and wealth.
                           2. Many are the caſes warranted by God, wherein ſome

Mors ergo quam irrogat Chriſti eſt lucrum: quam excipit, ſuum. Bern. loc. citat. Non eſt poteſtas niſi à Deo, vel jubente, vel ſinente. Cum ergo vir iuſtus, ſi fortè ſub rege homine etiam ſacrilego militet; rectè poſſit illo iubente bellare, civicae pacis ordinem ſervans: cui quod iubetur, vel non eſſe contra Dei praeceptum certum eſt, vel utrum ſit certum non eſt; it a ut fortaſſe reum regem ſaciat iniquitas imperandi, innocentem autem militem oſtendat ordo ſerviendi. Aug cont Fauſt. Manich. l. 22. c. 75. 2. 30.
                           3. If in this caſe a ſouldier die, he dieth in his way, and in the worke of God: ſo as, his death may be his beſt advantage. God having given his Angels charge over all his, when they are in warre, they will either keepe them from death, or when they die they will take their ſoules, as they did the ſoule of Lazarus, to carrie it to bliſſe. Therefore with much confidence he ſlayeth his enemy, with greater confidence he is himſelfe ſlaine. He doth a good turne to himſelfe if he be killed, and an acceptable thing to Chriſt if he ſlay his enemy. When he is ſlaine, he is not deſtroyed, but perfected. The death which he inflicteth is Chriſts gaine: and which he ſuffereth, his owne gaine.
                           The application of this point of obedience in particular concerneth ſuch as are or ſhalbe commanded, as Ioſhua here was, to fight with the enemies of the Church and State: that they teſtifie their obedience readily, with good conſcience and courage, and that for the Lords ſake.
                           
                              Quest. What if Chriſtians be under the ſubjection of Idolaters, or Infidels, ought they at ſuch a Kings command to go to warre?
                           
                              Anſw. An ancient Father giveth this anſwer. There is no power but of God, either commanding, or permitting it. Therefore a righteous man, if happily he ſerve as a ſouldier under a King that is even a ſacrilegious man, he may rightly warre at his command, keeping the order of civill peace: who is either aſſured that that which is commanded is againſt no command of God, or is not ſure whether it be ſo or no, ſo that, perhaps the iniquity of commanding may make the King guilty, but the order of ſerving may prove the ſouldier to be innocent.

                              And Moſes, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
                           
                           
                              See §. 1. THe performance of that promiſe which Moſes made, V. 9 is here generally propounded. The performance is expreſſed almoſt in the ſame words wherein the promiſe was propounded. In the promiſe, Moſes ſaid, I will ſtand on the top of the hill. In the performance it is ſaid, Moſes went up to the top of the hill. Only here is not mentioned the rod of God in his hand: but here are added two Aſſistants that went with Moſes, which were Aaron and Hur.
                           
                           Of Aaron much is ſpoken in other places. His name was agreeable to his function. For, Aaron importeth a teacher; and Prieſts (whereof he was the firſt and chiefeſt) were 
                                 Summum Sacerdotium ab Aaron cepiſſe definimus Aug. quaeſt ſuper Levit l. 3. q. 23. teachers: whereupon it is ſaid, The Priests lips ſhould keepe knowledge: and they ſhould ſeeke the law at his mouth, Mal. 2. 7. This Aaron was elder brother to Moſes, Exo. 6. 20. For, they died both in the ſame yeare; and Aaron was 123 years old, Numb. 33. 38, 39. And Moſes but a 120 Deut. 34. 7. Yet was Moſes preferred before Aaron. For in that God ſaith to Moſes of Aaron, He ſhalbe thy ſpokeſman unto the people, he importeth a Principality in Moſes, and a Miniſtry

                           Many and great were the prerogatives conferred on Aaron. For,
                           
                              1. He was choſen to aſſiſt Moſes in the meſſages which from God were ſent to Pharaoh, and in the wonders which were done in Egypt, Exo. 4. 30. &amp; 5. 1. For, Aaron could ſpeake well, Exo. 4 14.
                              2. When Moſes was abſent 40 dayes, Aaron was appointed chiefe Governour in his roome, Exo. 24. 
                                    •

3. Aaron was the firſt that was annointed High-Prieſt, 
                                    Veſtem ſumebat Aaron, qua eius ſummitas appareret. Aug. loc. citat. and clothed with the glorious prieſtly ornaments, Exod. 29. 5, &amp;c.
                              4. The Prieſt-hood was conferred upon Aaron and his ſeed by a perpetuall covenant. None els might execute the ſervices appertaining thereto, Lev. 7. 36. Num. 18. 8. Num. 16. 40. 2 Chro. 26. 18.
                              5. In teſtimony of Gods choice of Aaron, his rod onely among all the rods of the heads of Iſrael, did bud, bloſſome, and bring forth ripe almonds: and thereupon it was kept as a perpetuall memoriall before the Lord, Numb. 17. 8, 10. Hebr. 9. 4.
                              7. Aaron was to make an attonement when Gods wrath was kindled: and when multitudes died of the plague, he ſtood betwixt the living and the dead: and the plague was ſtayed, Numb. 16. 46, 48.
                              
                                 8. Aaron both in regard of his externall function, and alſo of his internall diſpoſition is ſtiled The Saint of the Lord, Pſal. 106. 16.
                                 
                                    Ob. He made a golden calfe, Exo. 32. 4. He with Miriam murmured againſt Moſes, Numb. 12. 1. He was incredulous, Numb. 20. 13.
                                 
                                    Anſw. Theſe were indeed great ſinnes. and manifeſt fruits of the fleſh: but onely particulars. The diſpoſition of his ſoule, and generall courſe of life was holy. Which of the Saints had not their blemiſhes? As the fleſh may be in the ſoule where the Spirit is: ſo in ſuch a ſoule may ſome fruits of the fleſh ſprout out.
                              
                              
                                 9. Aaron was an eſpeciall type of Christ, Heb. 5. 4, 5.
                                 
                                    Ob. Melchizedech was the type of Chriſt, Heb. 5. 6.
                                 
                                    Anſw. Melchizedech was a type in ſundry eminent prerogatives, which are noted by the Apoſtle, Heb. 7. But yet in the office it ſelfe, the office of Priest-hood, Aaron was alſo a type.
                              
                           
                           By theſe particulars noted of Aaron, it plainly appeareth that he was a fit aſſiſtant to Moſes in that ſolemne duty of prayer continued a whole day.

                           Whether this were his proper name, or a name of his place, is not very certaine: But moſt certaine it is that he was made a Magiſtrate in that State. Hereupon when Moſes was to be abſent ſome while from the people, he ſaith, (Exod. 24. 14.) Behold Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them: namely to Aaron, for matters ſpirituall, and to Hur for matters temporall. 
                                 Moſes iuſſit fratrem Aaron &amp; ſororis Mariae virum nomine Vrion ſibi aſſiſtere, &amp;c. Ioſeph. Antiq. Iud. l. 3. c. 2. 
                              Flavius Ioſephus rendreth this reaſon of Moſes his taking theſe two, Aaron and Hur with him, that the one was his brother, the other his ſiſter Miriams husband. But of this latter we have no evidence in Scripture. Evidence we have (as hath been ſhewed before) that Hur was a Prince and Governour of the people.

                              IN extraordinary prayer mutuall aſſistance of Saints is uſefull. It is expreſly recorded that Hezekiah the King, and Iſaiah the prophet (both of them) prayed and cried to heaven when Sennacharib invaded Ieruſalem with an huge hoſte. The deſtruction of that hoſt followed thereupon, 2 Chro. 32. 20, 21. Eſther, as ſhe ſent to the Iewes to faſt for her, ſo ſhe and her maidens faſted together, Esth. 4. 16. Daniel, though a man powerfull in prayer deſired the aſſiſtance of his three companions, when he begged an extraordinary favour of God, Dan. 2. 17. 18. Yea, Christ himſelfe, the Mediatour betwixt God and man, when in the dayes of his fleſh he withdrew himſelfe to that extraordinary prayer which he made that very night wherein he was apprehended, took three of his prime Diſciples, and calls on them to watch and pray, Mat. 26. 37, 41.
                           Mutuall aſſiſtance of Saints makes prayers much more powerfull and effectuall then otherwiſe they would be. For, the fervour of one mans ſpirit joyned with anothers, is as fire put to fire, wherby the heat is much greater. Iron ſharpneth iron: ſo a man ſharpneth the countenance of his friend, Pro. 27. 17. That is, ſociety, and mutuall communion betwixt friends, is of as great force to quicken each others ſpirit, and ſo to cheere up their countenance, as whetting iron upon iron is to ſharpen it. This proverbe is beſt verified in the

communion of Saints about holy duties, and eſpecially in mutuall prayer: whereby we may much cheriſh, ſupport, and encourage one another.
                           This pattern of theſe three Worthies, Moſes, Aaron, and Hur, is moſt worthy our due obſervation, and that as oft as any weighty and juſt occaſion is offerd. Let it not therfore be enough in extraordinary caſes to make our ordinary prayers. And as we ſet our ſelves more then ordinarily to performe this duty, ſo let us (ſuſpecting our owne weakneſſe and dulneſſe) take the helpe of ſome choice ones, who in ſuch a caſe may be a good help unto us. Provided that the good lawes of Church and Common-wealth under which we live be not herein ſcandalouſly violated, and we our ſelves brought

By your conſcionable care herein, give occaſion to your people that are under you to bleſſe God for ſetting you over them: give them occaſion to pray for you; yea, to pray that God would heare your prayers for them. Thus will they eſteeme you, as 2 Sam. 18 3. 
                              Davids people eſteemed him, worth ten thouſand of them. Thus will they readily, willingly, cheerefully be ſubject to you, and yeeld to you in every thing your due. This is the beſt means of knitting hearts of people to their Magiſtrates and Miniſters.

                              PRayer promiſed muſt be performed. When Pharaoh felt the heavy hand of God to lie upon him, he deſires Moſes and Aaron to pray for him. They (deſirous to ſhew how much rather they would that he ſhould ſubmit himſelf for his owne and peoples preſervation to the good pleaſure of God, then by his fierce wrath be deſtroyed) make promiſe to pray for him, and anſwerably they made conſcience to performe their promiſe: whereupon it is noted, that Exo. 8. 12, 32. 
                              they went out from Pharaoh, and cried unto the Lord. Yea, though —9. 30, 33. he knew that when the judgement was removed, Pharaoh would againe harden his heart, yet was Moſes faithfull in performing his promiſe. 1 Sam 7. 5, 9, 10. 
                              Samuel having made a promiſe to pray for Iſrael, when the Philiſtims were aſſembled againſt them, he ſo cried to the Lord, as the Lord thundred with a great thunder upon the Philiſtines, and diſcomfited them. Yea, he acknowledgeth it to be —12, 23. 
                              a ſinne
                              
to neglect to pray for the people.
                           And ſurely it is an hainous ſinne: eſpecially after promiſe of doing it, is paſt. For, in this caſe there is a double bond broken.
                                 1. The bond of loue and mercy, whereby we are bound to pray as occaſion requireth, though we have not promiſed ſo to do.
                                 2. The bond of truth and fidelity, wherewith our owne mouth (by making promiſe) hath bound us. Pſal. 19 4. Promiſe is to be kept in many things that are prejudiciall to us. How much more in ſuch duties as we are neceſſarily tied unto, whether they be promiſed or no.
                              
                           
                           We have juſt cauſe, on this ground to call to mind what occaſions have beene offered to draw us to make promiſe of this duty: and withall to conſider whether we have made good our promiſe or no. Queſtionleſſe, there hath beene much failing herein. It is uſuall for Chriſtians on all occaſions, when they are in any want, or diſtreſſe, when they part one from another, when they write one to another, both to deſire, and alſo to promiſe this mutuall Chriſtian helpe of prayer. But if examination be made of the performance of ſuch promiſes, even they that are forward and frequent in making them, wilbe found exceeding backward and negligent in performing them. Be perſwaded that this careleſſe neglect of that whereunto ye are ſo doubly bound, is a great ſinne. Repent of that which is paſt, and for the time to come be more faithfull and conſcionable. Such a promiſe is not far from a vow. The more tender ought we to be of breaking it. Of the two, it is better not to promiſe, then to promiſe, and 
                                 Melius eſt non promittere, quam promittere &amp; non facere. Hier. Comment. l. 13 in Ezec. 44. not performe what we promiſe. But let not this keep men from promiſing. For mutuall prayer being in it ſelfe a bounden duty, we ought by promiſes to draw on our ſelves thereto. Promiſe therefore, and performe.

                           It appeareth hereby that Moſes waxed weary with holding up his hands, and being weary, to reſt them, let them downe. Whereby it is implied, that in his continuance to pray, his ſpirit waxed faint, and his faith weake, which made him ſomwhat to intermit that duty.
                           As therefore Iſrael had the better, while Moſes with a

ſtedfaſt faith continued to pray for them: ſo while, thorow weakneſſe, he intermitted that duty, the enemy had the better.
                           The Summe of this verſe is, A demonstration of the power of faithfull prayer.
                           
                           This is manifeſted by the difference betwixt perſiſting therein, and deſisting therefrom. Anſwerably there are two parts of the forenamed Summe.
                              
                                 1. The joyfull effect of perſiſting in faithfull prayer.
                                 2. The wofull event of deſiſting therefrom.
                              
                           
                           In both theſe there is one thing implied, another expreſſed.
                           In the former, 1. The Cauſe is implied; which was, that Moſes ſomewhile continued ſtedfaſt and fervent in faithfull prayer, ſignified by holding up his hand. For where it is ſaid, When Moſes held up his hand, is it not intimated, that he did hold up his hand?
                           2. The Effect is expreſſed, Amalek prevailed.
                           
                           In the latter likewiſe, 1. The Occaſion is implied, which was that Moſes ſomewhat fainted in ſpirit, failed in the vigour of his faith, and intermitted to pray as he had begun. This is ſignified by letting downe his hand. If he had not at all let downe his hand, why is mention here made thereof? Why was ſuch means uſed to enable him to hold it up the more ſteddily, as is noted in the next verſe? But, to put this out of all doubt, in the next verſe it is expreſly ſaid, that Moſes hands were weary.
                           
                           2. The Event is thus expreſſed, Amalek prevailed.

                                 III. Saints are prone to faint in their fervency of prayer.
                                 
                              
                           
                           4. From the Event following thereupon (Amalek prevailed) I gather, that,
                                 IIII. Intermiſſion of faithfull and fervent prayer oft proves very prejudiciall.
                                 
                              
                           
                           5. From the different iſſue of this warre, that one while Iſrael prevailed, another while Amalek prevailed, I conclude, that,
                                 V. Warre is wavering. Succeſſe therein ſomtimes hangs one way, ſomtimes another way.
                              
                           
                        
                        
                           §. 43. Of the power of faithfull prayer.
                           I. §. 42. Dignior ſequetur effectus, quem ſerventior praecedit affectus. Aug. Probae Epiſt 121. Impetravit efficaciter quod petijt, quia fideliter poſtulavit. Cypr, Serm. 6 de Orat. Dom. 
                              FAithfull prayer is powerfull. By faithfull prayer I meane,
                           1. The prayer of a faithfull man, ſuch an one as Moſes was, Numb. 12. 7. St. Iames ſtileth ſuch an one a righteous man, and ſaith of his prayer, that it availeth much, Iames 5. 16.
                           2. The prayer of ſuch a man made in faith. For ſo was this prayer of Moſes. The holding up of his hand implied the ſteddineſſe of his faith: and St. Iames giveth this title to effectuall prayer, Prayer of faith, Iam. 5. 15. Much in Scripture is ſpoken of the See The whole Armour of God, on Eph. 6. 18. Treat. 3. Part. 1 §. 22, &amp;c. power of prayer; and all is ſpoken of ſuch prayer as is here meant. The ſacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord: but the prayer of the upright is his delight, Prov. 15. 8. The upright uſe to pray in faith: the wicked cannot do ſo. By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent ſacrifice (Heb. 11. 14.) then Cain. Many and admirable are the things which the Saints in all ages have done by faith, Hebr. 11. But where faith hath failed, the divine power hath been ſtinted, Mat. 13. 58. &amp; 17. 20. Heb. 3. 19. Not without cauſe therefore doth the Lord put in this proviſo of faith, where he ſpeaketh of prevailing by prayer, Mar. 11. 24. What things ſoever ye deſire, when ye pray, believe
                              
                              that ye receive them, and ye ſhall have them. So his Apoſtle, Iam. 1. 5, 6. If any man lacke, let him ask of God, but let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. The faith of thoſe who ſought and found helpe of Chriſt in the dayes of his fleſh, giveth good proofe hereof. Mat. 8. 13. &amp; 9. 2, 22. &amp; 15. 28. Mar. 9. 23. Luk. 7. 50. It is recorded of the Chriſtians Niceph Caliſt. Eccleſiaſt. Hiſt. lib 4. cap. 12. citat hanc hiſtoriam ex Apologiâ quae à Tertulliano edita eſt pro fide ad Senatum. Rom. Vide Oroſ. lib. 7. cap. 15. in the Primitive times of the Church that When Marcus Antoninus waged warre against the Germans, his army was brought to a deſperate caſe, thorow great and long thirst: and that the legion of Christian ſouldiers fell on their knees after their accustomed manner, praying and craving helpe of God; and that that thing, as a new and unaccuſtomed matter, ſtrucke a great terrour into the enemies. And that, while the Chriſtians prayed, another greater matter fell out beyond their imagination and expectation. For, the enemies were ſtricken downe with many ſtroaks of thunder: and the army being even ready to periſh with thirst and want of water, was refreſhed. So effectuall ſurely were the prayers of Chriſtians. Prophane Historians, who have written of the Romane Emperours, have related as much. I have the rather tranſcribed this hiſtory, becauſe it is ſomwhat pertinent to the pattern of Moſes here noted in the text.
                           Faithfull prayer is that meanes which God himſelfe, the almighty and all ſufficient God, the originall fountaine of all Faith the meanes to receive all bleſſing from God Nemo or at niſi quod credit &amp; ſperat. Bern. ſuper Miſſus eſt, Serm 4. bleſſing-hath ſanctified for receiving from him whatſoever he in his wiſdome ſeeth meet to be done for, or given to any of his children. So that, it is as a conduit pipe, conveying all needfull bleſſing from that high fountaine in heaven, to us on earth. In this reſpect, to him, who ſaid unto the Lord, If thou canst do any thing helpe us, Chriſt gave this anſwer, If thou canſt believe, all things are poſſible to him that believeth, Mar. 9. 22, 23. On the other ſide, when he was among them that believed not, He could do there no mighty worke, Mar. 6. 5.
                           
                              Ob. This tying of divine bleſſing to faith, which is a gift and grace in man, ſeemeth to impeach the infinite and unlimited power of God.
                           
                              
                              Anſw. Nothing leſſe. For, faith is not the proper, primary, Mans faith impeacheth not Gods power. and principall cauſe of any divine bleſſing, but onely a meanes ſubordinate to the divine providence. It doth therfore no more impeach Gods power, then any other meanes. There are among others, three eſpeciall conſiderations which evidently demonſtrate that faith more manifeſteth then empaireth the power, providence, wiſdome, and other attributes of God. They are theſe.
                           1. God himſelfe worketh in man this gift of faith. Eph. 2. 8.
                              Faith is the gift of God.
                           
                           2. God himſelfe hath appointed and ſanctified this means. No creature hath impoſed it on him.
                           3. The bleſſing which by faith commeth to any, is obtained, not by any worth or vertue of faith as it is an act of man, but meerly by reaſon of that order which in wiſdome God hath appointed for receiving from him ſuch and ſuch bleſſings.
                           Good cauſe we have therefore, all of us that are faithfull, in all things wherein we ſtand in need of any ſpeciall favour, ſuccour, and bleſſing from the Lord, to hold up our hands to God, as Moſes here did, by faithfull prayer to ſeek it of him, &amp; expect it from him. For, aſſuredly the prayer which ſhalbe 
                                 Quae fidelis &amp; fervens oratio ſuerit, caelum ſine dubio penetrabit: unde certum eſt quod vacua redire non poterit. Bern. in Quadrageſſ, Serm 4 faithfull and fervent, will pierce heaven: from whence, it is certain, it can not returne empty. Wherefore, when ſpirituall enemies aſſault us: when we find any effects of Gods diſpleaſure lying on us: when we enterprize any weighty buſines: when we obſerve great need, and find want of any grace: when enemies invade us: when a plague enters among us: when a famine begins to pinch: yea when we have juſt cauſe to feare any of theſe: when an army by land, or a fleet by ſea is ſent forth for our owne defence, or for ſuccour to our friends or allies: for obtaining or re-gaining any publique, or private bleſſings, temporall, or ſpirituall, on our ſelves or others: for preventing or removing like evils: on all occaſions let us hold up our hands: let us make faithfull and fervent prayers to God.
                           Of praying we ſpake §. 27. before.
                           
                              
The manner of praying with a ſtedfaſt faith (ſignified by holding up the hand) is the point here to be eſpecially obſerved. For, faith to prayer is as fire to powder. In it the life, vigour, and power of prayer conſiſteth. By faith prayer flieth The power of prayer conſiſteth in faith. Grandis fidei clamor; Amb. Comment. in Pſal. 118. Ser. 19. ver. 1. up to heaven, as Daniels did, Dan. 10. 12. By faith it is made acceptable to God, as Abels was, Hebr. 11. 4. By faith it prevailes with God, as Iacobs did, Hoſ. 12. 4. By faith it turnes away Gods wrath, as Moſes did, Exo. 32. 14. By faith it obtaines ſufficient grace, as Pauls did, 2 Cor. 12. 9. Faith added to prayer maketh it powerfull in all things, and profitable to all things. Pray therefore, and pray in faith. Thus hold up thy hand.
                           
                           For helpe herein, obſerve theſe directions.
                           1. Take good notice of Gods promiſes, and well acquaint thy ſelfe therewith. Gods promiſes are the only, true, proper Directions to pray in faith. Of Gods promiſes, how they are the ground of faith, See The whole Armour of God, on Eph. 6. 16. Treat. 2. Part. 6, §. 71, &amp;c. ground of faith. What is promiſed, may, and muſt be believed. What is believed without a promiſe, is not juſtly and duly believed. It is rather raſhly and audaciouſly preſumed.
                           2. Meditate on Gods properties, ſuch as theſe. 1. His ſupreme Soveraignty, wherby he hath an abſolute command over all. 2. His Omnipotency, whereby he is able to do any thing. 3. His All-ſufficiency, whereby, as he hath all treaſures in himſelfe, ſo he can give what he will to whom he will. 4. His Omni-preſence, or being every where, whereby he taketh notice of all things. 5. His unſearchable wiſdome, whereby he diſpoſeth all things to the beſt. 6. His Free-grace, wherby he is moved for his own ſake to do good to ſuch as are unworthy in themſelves. 7. His Rich-mercy, whereby his bowels are ſtirred at the miſeries of his children, and moved to ſuccour them. 8. His Truth, and faithfulneſſe, which makes him perform all his promiſes. 9. His perfect Iuſtice, which makes him judge and revenge thoſe that unjuſtly wrong and vexe his Church. 10. His fierce Wrath and terrour, which makes him a conſuming fire to his enemies. 11. His Immutability, which ſhewes him to be ſuch a God ſtill to us, as of old he was to his Church.
                           
                              
3. Fixe the eye of thy faith on Ieſus Chriſt thy Mediator, ſitting at Gods right hand, and making interceſſion for thee: by vertue of which interceſſion thy perſon and prayers are made acceptable to God, ſo as, in much confidence and ſtedfaſtneſſe of faith thou maiſt expect a gracious acceptance.
                           4. Call to mind Gods former works. How theſe are of uſe to ſtrengthen faith hath beene ſhewed §. 33. before.
                           5. Wait and expect Gods leiſure. Praeſcribe no time to him. Hab. 2. 3. See The whole armour of God, on Eph. 6. 17. Treat 2. Part. 7 §. 3, 8, 9. 
                              There is an appointed time. This can not be prevented, nor ſhalbe overſlipt. To be perſwaded hereof, and anſwerably to wait patiently and contentedly, when at firſt we are not heard, will much ſettle and ſtrengthen faith. Hope, like a good daughter, nouriſheth faith.
                           6. Let thy ſoule be ſo qualified when thou prayeſt, as thy faith be not quailed with the evill diſpoſition of the heart. The right qualification of the ſoule conſiſteth much in the true intent, bent, and inclination thereof, when in truth it intends that which is acceptable to God, and the bent and inclination of the will is thereunto. For, howſoever our good intents, endeavours, and performances are no cauſes of faith, yet, as effects and ſignes they ſo quicken the ſpirit, as they make a man both more ſhew forth, and better uſe his faith then otherwiſe he could. And on the contrary, See The whole Armour of God, on Eph. 6. 18. Treat. 3 Part. 1. §. 20. ſin damps the ſpirit: and a purpoſe of ſinning is to faith, as water to gun-powder. This he well underſtood, who ſaid, Pſal. 66. 18. 
                              If I regard iniquity in mine heart, the Lord will not heare me. Thus therefore he profeſſeth to prepare himſelfe, —26. 6. 
                              I will waſh my hands in innocency, ſo will I compaſſe thine altar, O Lord.
                           
                           7. When the ſpirit is heavy, and the ſoule perplexed; when doubting and feare ariſeth in thy heart; when that ſweet inward ſenſe, joy, and comfort whereby faith uſeth to be ſupported, faileth in thee; then let thy judgement and underſtanding ſuſtaine thy faith: labour by evident arguments taken from Gods promiſes, and other grounds of faith before mentioned, to convince thy ſoule, that God

heareth thy prayer, accepteth thy perſon in Chriſt, and will do that which in his wiſdome he ſeeth to be moſt fit for thee. Reaſon and expoſtulate the caſe with thy ſoule. Say as the Pſalmiſt did in ſuch a caſe, Why art thou cast downe, O my 
                              Pſal. 42. 11. 
                              ſoule? and why art thou diſquieted in me? Hope thou in God; for I ſhall yet praiſe him, who is the health of my countenance and my God. There are two props to ſupport our faith. One Two props of faith. is an inward comfortable apprehenſion, a ſweet ſenſe and aſſured perſwaſion of Gods fatherly love to us wrought by the ſpirit of comfort. The other is good knowledge and underſtanding of the true grounds of faith, as Gods promiſes, properties, and former dealings with others and our ſelves, the mediation of Chriſt, &amp;c. When the former failes men, by the latter they may ſupport and ſuſtaine themſelves. This latter keepes many which want the former from deſpaire: For it makes them not to dare to diſtruſt.
                           8. To all other meanes adde prayer. Pray as he that ſaid, Mar 9. 24. 
                              Lord I believe: help my unbeliefe. Pray for the ſpirit of ſupplication. For, there is Zac. 12. 10. promiſe made thereof. Pray for faith, which is ſhewed to be the life of that gift. So did the Apoſtles, Lord increaſe our faith, Luke 17. 5. So did Chriſt pray for Peters faith, that it might not faile, Luke 22. 32. In praying for faith, and for ſtedfaſtneſſe thereof, 
                                 Niſi ſides data eſſet orare non poſſet. Aug. Sixto Epiſt. 105. pray in faith. For, where no faith is, there can be no effectuall prayer.
                        
                        
                           §. 44. Of continuing to pray.
                           II. See § 42. 
                              BY continuance in faithfull prayer divine ſuccour is continued. Thus much an Angell from heaven teſtifieth, when he ſaith to Daniel, 
                              Dan. 10. 12. 
                              From the firſt day that thou didſt ſet thy ſelfe to humble thy ſelfe before thy God, thy words were heard. This, as it is true in regard of long holding out, and continuing prayer at one time by reaſon of the need of preſent and continued ſuccour from God, ſo alſo is it true in regard of frequent and conſtant returning unto prayer

time after time. Exo. 30. 7, 8. The morning and evening incenſe which was conſtantly to be offered every day unto the Lord, prefigured as much. 2 Cor. 12. 8, 9 
                              Paul being long buffeted by Satan, prayed thrice, that is, oft, and all the while found ſufficient aſſiſtance. Acts 12. 5. Prayer being made of the Church for Peter, he found aſſiſtance all the while he was in priſon, and deliverance out of priſon. Luke 22. 42, 43, 44. 
                              Christ continued to pray all the while he was in his agony, and returned to prayer againe and againe, and found ſufficient ſupportance, Heb. 5. 7. 
                              He was heard in that he feared.
                           
                           The delight which God taketh in faithfull prayer, the deſire which he hath to give evidence of his fatherly acceptance of his childrens conformity to that order which he hath preſcribed, his faithfulneſſe in performing to the uttermoſt his promiſes for hearing prayer, together with other motives ariſing from his owne goodneſſe, are the cauſes of his ordering and diſpoſing his bleſſings according to his Saints prayers.
                           As §. 27. before we were taught by prayer to ſeeke ſuccour of God, ſo here we are further directed for continuance of ſuccour to continue in prayer. 
                                 The whole Armour of God, on Eph. 6, 18. Treat. 3. Part. 2 §. 98. Of long continuance in prayer at one time: Ibid. §. 118, 120. Of praying every day, and keeping our ſet times for prayer: Of Ibid §. 137, &amp;c. 
                              all perſeverance in prayer, I have ſpoken elſewhere. It ſhalbe ſufficient here to propound ſome caſes whereunto ſuch continuance, as is here in my text implied, may be applied.
                           1. If any be in ſight of an army as Moſes here was, they muſt do as Moſes here did. Caſes wherein prayer is to be continued.
                           
                           2. If an army of land-ſouldiers, or a fleet of ſea-ſouldiers be ſent forth, prayer more then ordinary muſt be daily continued for them, till we heare of the iſſue.
                           3. If a Parliament, or any other ſolemne aſſembly do meet about weighty matters, while that aſſembly continueth, prayer for it muſt be continued.
                           4. If King, or other Magiſtrate of good note and name, of good uſe and proofe: if a faithfull and powerfull Miniſter; if parent, husband, wife, maſter, or any to whom

we are by any ſpeciall relation bound, be in any danger by ſickneſſe or otherwiſe, prayer is to be continued for them, till we ſee ſome iſſue.
                           5. If any by reaſon of the ſtone, gangrene, cancer, ſiſtula, or any other torturing and dangerous diſeaſe be under the Chyrurgians hand to be cut, or to have any member cut off, prayer for Gods aſſiſtance and bleſſing is to be continued.
                           6. If children be put forth to be trained up to any calling, or if we be about any mariage for them, for continuance of gods bleſſing, continuall prayer muſt be made.
                           So in ſundry other caſes like unto theſe.
                           Intermitting, or ceaſing prayer before it is meet, doth oft prove See The whole Armour of God, on Eph. 6. 18. Treat. 3. Part. 2. §. 116. very prejudiciall. It was ſuch an occaſion that made Eliſha the Prophet angry with Ioaſh King of Iſrael for ſmiting but thrice with his arrowes on the ground. 
                                 Moyſes vincere adverſarium non potuit; niſi poſtquam ſtabilis in ſigno allevatis jugiter manibus perſeveravit. Cypr de Exhort. Martyr. cap 8. 
                              Thou ſhouldeſt (ſaid he) have ſmitten five or ſix times: then hadſt thou ſmitten Syria till thou hadſt conſumed it. 2 King. 13. 19. Here in this place we ſee that Moiſes could not overcome the enemy, till with ſtedfaſtneſſe he perſevered holding up his hands with the rod of God in them.
                        
                        
                           §. 45. Of fainting in prayer.
                           III. See § 42. 
                              SAints are prone to faint in their fervency of prayer. Theſe phraſes (Pſal 69 3.

Their drowſineſſe when Chriſt tooke them with him in the garden to pray, do all manifeſt their proneſſe to faint, to waxe heavy, and dull.
                           
                              
Chriſt in that place gives this reaſon hereof, See The whole Armour of God, on Eph. 6. 18. Treat. 3. Part. 5 § 134. 
                              The ſpirit indeed is willing, but the fleſh is weake.
                           
                           As this, it being a fruit of the fleſh, an evidence of the corruption of our nature, miniſtreth much matter of humiliation, ſo, it being no other kind of corruption but that which the beſt Saints are ſubject unto, it affords matter alſo of conſolation: ſo as we need not be over-much dejected at our proneſſe thereto, ſeeing it is that condition that none (while they remaine in the fleſh) are exempted from. And this is one uſe that we may make of ſuch weakneſſes as are noted to be in ſuch as the Holy Ghoſt regiſtreth in the Kalender of true Saints.
                           Yet are we not hereupon to ſooth our ſelves too much in our weakneſſes: but rather this proneſſe to faint ſhould make us with our uttermoſt power Heb. 12. 12. to lift up the hands which hang downe, and the feeble knees: to rouze up our ſoules, and to quicken our ſpirits when we go to prayer. Directions hereunto have been given

                              INtermiſſion of faithfull and servent prayer oft proves very prejudiciall. Here it was an occaſion of the enemies prevailing againſt his Church. It endangered Peters life, (Mat. 14. 30.) for it was the cauſe of his ſinking in the water. In this kind of fainting may be reckoned 1 Sam. 10. 8.—13 8, &amp;c. 
                              Sauls preventing the time that Samuel had appointed to come to him: which coſt him his kingdome: and that weariſomneſſe which is taxed in the Iewes that ſaid, Am. 8. 5. when will the New-Moones and Sabbaths be gone? and ſaid of the ſervices which they performed to the Lord, Mal. 1. 13. 
                              Behold what a wearineſſe it is. Of a faint ſpirit which Iam. 1. 627. the Apoſtle oppoſeth to faith, he ſaith, Let not that man thinke that he ſhall receive any thing of the Lord.
                           
                           1. To intermit faithfull prayer while the occaſion remaineth,

is to intermit the means whereby the bleſſing deſired is to be obtained. It is as if (before the battell be ended) ſouldiers ſhould ceaſe to fight, or runners in a race fall downe and lie ſtill, before they be come to the goale.
                           2. By ſuch fainting and intermitting prayer, as the weakneſſe of fleſh in man is manifeſted, ſo the power, truth, wiſdome, goodneſſe, and other divine properties are impeached. How then can it be thought but that much prejudice muſt needs come to ſuch men thereby.
                           The reaſon why mens prayers do in the iſſue prove fruitleſſe, Information in the cauſe of fruitleſſe prayers. may hence be gathered. They faint, they faile, they intermit, they give over praying before that for which they pray be accompliſhed. When any judgement publique or private is beginning, or is feared, as plague, famine, ſword, reſtraint of liberty, or the like, hearty, earneſt, extraordinary prayer is oft made, yea and faſting added thereto: but if God ſeeme to tarry long before he remove that judgement, men think it in vaine ſtill to wait, (as he who ſaid, 2 King. 6. 33. 
                              What ſhould I wait for the Lord any longer?) and ſo looſe the fruit of their former prayers, by not following them, and continuing to hold out till the time appointed of the Lord. The like may be ſaid of prayer for obtaining ſpeciall bleſſings, given over.
                           How fitly now may that generall encouragement of the Apoſtle, (Gal. 6. 9. See The whole Armour of God, on Eph 6. 13. Treat. 1. Part 4 § 12. 
                              let us not be weary of well doing) yea and the reaſon thereof (for in due time we ſhall reape if we faint not) be applied to prayer. There is nothing whereunto continuance and perſeverance is more requiſite then prayer. Of the benefit of perſeverance in prayer we ſpake § 44. Neceſſitatibus implicatus or a fortiter &amp; dic Deo quod habes in Pſalmo, In neceſſitatibus meis erue me. Aug. Bonifac. Epiſt. 70. before. Here we ſee the prejudice of the contrary. If therefore deſire of good, or feare of evill be motives of force, there are motives of force to provoke us to all perſeverance, and in holding out to be fervent. Therefore when thou art in ſtraits be ardent, and inſtant in prayer, and ſay to God as thou art taught, (Pſal. 25. 17.) O bring thou me out of my distreſſes.

                              As I have done, ſo God hath requited me. Take for inſtance the Kings that upon their conqueſt over Sodome and Gomorrah were overthrowne by Abram, Gen. 14. 11, 15. And the Amalakites that ſacked Ziklag and were ſurprized by David, 1 Sam. 30. 1, 17. All ages have given wofull demonſtrations herof. I will (in that innumerable variety of inſtances which might be produced, inſiſt only on ſuch as ſhew how the Church and people of God have had the worſt in battell. Ioſ. 7. 4. Victorious Ioſhua and his army not onely here, but after he began to conquer Canaan, fled before their enemies. Iudg. 20. 21, 23 The eleven Tribes were twice put to the worſt by the Benjamites, and after that the Benjamites utterly vanquiſhed by them. Iudg. 3, &amp;c. The Iſraelites were oft overthrowne by their enemies in the Iudges time, and in the Kings time. Valorous David was forced to fly from 1 Sam. 21. 10.

                              Thou haſt ſaved us from our enemies, and haſt put them to ſhame that hated us. But thou haſt caſt off and put us to ſhame, and goeſt not forth with our armies: Thou makeſt us to turne our backs to the enemy, &amp;c. There are many more like

theſe thorowout the Scripture. The heathen by their experimentall

                           True it is that warres are ordered by God: ſo as this uncertainty of warre is not without him. And yet is it not thorow any neglect or impotency in him. Our God is not like the Gods of the Heathen, who by ſuch as tooke them for gods are accounted oftentimes unable to helpe in battell: yea 
                                 —antiquo memores de vulncre poenas Exigit alma Venus—Ovid. Metamorph lib. 14. De Marte a Diomede vulnerato. Homerus Iliad. β

He is able at all times to make whom he will victorious. Onely in his wiſdome he ſeeth it meet ſomtimes to ſuffer enemies to have the better over his people. Though we could ſee no reaſon why he ſhould ſuffer enemies to prevaile, yet ought we to lay our hands upon our mouth, and not dare to impeach his power, wiſdome, juſtice, truth, or any other of his infinite, excellent properties; but rather to ſay as good old Elie did, It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good. And as David, If I ſhall find favour in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me againe. But if he thus ſay, I have no delight in thee, Here I am; let him do to me as ſeemeth good to him. Yet in Scripture many weighty reaſons are implied, to demonſtrate to us the equity of Gods providence in this particular. Some of theſe reaſons are ſuch as theſe that follow.
                           1. To cauſe his Church and people more narrowly and Why God ſuffereth enemies to prevaile over his Church. thorowly to ſearch themſelves. For many evils many times are ſo cloſely conveighed and concealed, as unleſſe God by ſome viſible judgement force men to ſearch it out, it may lie and feſter, and ſo cauſe the greater miſchiefe. This was the chiefe cauſe that moved God ſo to leave Ioſhua and his army, Ioſ 7. 10, &amp;c. as they fled before the men of Ai,
                           
                           2. To puniſh ſome ſcandalous ſin whereby the profeſſion of godlineſſe is ſlandered. This reaſon God himſelfe renders 2 Sam 12. 10. of thoſe croſſes which by the ſword befell David. Thus did God puniſh the Iſraelites for their preſumption. Num. 14. 44.
                           
                           3. To bring people to ſound and ſolemne repentance.

                              Iudg. 20 26. This fruit was manifeſted in the eleven Tribes, after they had beene twice foiled by the Benjamites.
                           
                           4. To ſhew that victory commeth not meerely from Iudg. 20. 17. &amp;c mans preparation. For, after that the foreſaid eleven Tribes had loſt at one time two and twenty thouſand men, and at another time eighteene thouſand, then God gave them the victory.
                           5. To turne the boaſting of enemies to their greater ſhame and dammage: as that advantage which the Philiſtims got againſt Sampſon did. Read for this purpoſe Iſa. 10. 5, &amp;c. the juſt inſultations over the proud King of Aſſyria.
                           
                           6. To give evidence of his wiſdome and power in caſting downe and raiſing up againe; according to that which 1 Sam. 2. 6, 7. is ſaid of him, The Lord killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth downe to the grave, and bringeth up: he bringeth low and lifteth up. On this ground, when David was forced out of his native country, and the city which he had in a ſtrange country was ſpoiled and burnt by enemies, and his owne —30. 6. ſouldiers ſpake of ſtoning him, he encouraged himſelfe in the Lord his God.
                           
                           7. To make men more fervently, inſtantly, and conſtantly to call upon God: as Moſes here did. For obſerving that when his hands fell, Amalek prevailed, he uſed all the helpe he could to keepe his hands up and ſteddy, as is noted in the next verſe.
                           Good ground of hope and comfort is hereby miniſtred to Hope to ſuch as are overcome. ſuch as ſomtimes have the worſt in war, and againſt whom enemies have prevailed, that the ſtreame may turn, that they who are overthrowne may riſe againe, and the conquered prove conquerers. For, the Lord, who is the orderer and diſpoſer of the ſucceſſe of war ever remaineth the ſame, as wiſe to know when to ſuffer Amalek, and when Iſrael to prevaile, as able to give victory to the conquered, as ready to heare the cries of thoſe that are overthrowne, and to receive ſuch as thereby are brought to renew their repentance, as carefull of his owne honour, as obſervant of enemies inſultations,

as ever he was. Let us wiſely obſerve the ends of Gods permiſſion in this caſe, (whereof ſome are noted) and anſwerably make uſe thereof. Theſe times give juſt occaſion Miſ-judge not ſuch as are vanquiſhed. to make a wiſe application of this point. Enemies as hatefull to God as Amalek was, have in many places had the upper hand of ſuch as have had as true notes of the true Church as Iſrael had. What then? ſhall we hereupon impeach God of injuſtice, or make queſtion of the truth of their religion, or, ſo loade them with ſinne, as if they were the greateſt ſinners of all. Farre bee that from us.
                           1. Concerning God, we ought not to ſuffer a thought to ariſe in our minds, derogatory to his juſtice: but if any ſuch do begin to riſe, preſently to quaſh and ſuppreſſe them. God in juſtice may make Idolaters his rod (as he did the Heathen, Iſa. 10. 5.) to puniſh thoſe that are of the true Religion. But after the rod is thus uſed, to what end is it but to be caſt into the fire?
                           2. Concerning the difference of religion betwixt Proteſtants and Papiſts, we are not to judge of it by event and ſucceſſe in warre. There are other more ſure evidences grounded on Gods Word, which give ſuch demonſtrations of the truth of the one, and falſhood of the other, as we may pawne life, ſoule, and eternall ſalvation, upon the truth of that which we profeſſe: and renounce ſalvation, if Popery be the means of attaining thereto.
                           3. Concerning their ſins, whether they be more or greater then the ſins of others that are of the ſame profeſſion, but not ſo trampled upon as they, we are to leave to the determination of the higheſt Iudge. The Lord hath given us a wiſe caveat in this caſe, Luke 13. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
                           Let us believe and hope the beſt; and do as Moſes here did, be more earneſt in prayer for them, Iudg. 20. 26. Ioſ. 7. 6, &amp;c. Num. 21. 2.
                           To conclude, when the cauſe of warre is juſt, the danger or conqueſt of a Chriſtian is to be ballanced by the affection of the heart, not by the iſſue of warre. The iſſue of the combate

can not be ill where the cauſe of the combatant is good: as the 
                                 Ex cordis affectu non belli eventu penſatur vel periculum, vel victoria Chriſtiani.

Si in voluntate alterum occidendi, te potius occidi contigerit, moreris homicida, Quod ſi praeval

Tēp. c. 1 iſſue may not be accounted good, when a good cauſe and right intention hath not gone before. If with a mind of ſlaying men thou art kild, thou dieſt a murtherer. But if thou prevaileſt, and in deſire of conqueſt and revenge thou ſlayeſt another, thou liveſt a murtherer. But it becomes not a Chriſtian, whether he live or die, be a conquerer, or be conquered, to be a murtherer. Vnhappy is that victory where a conquerer of man is conquered by ſin.
                        
                        
                           §. 48. Of the interpretation and reſolution of the twelfth Verſe.
                           
                              EXOD. XVII. XII.
                              But Moſes hands were heavy, and they tooke a ſtone and put it under him, and he ſate thereon: and Aaron and Hur ſtaid up his hands, the one on the one ſide, and the other on the other ſide, and his hands were ſteddy unto the going downe of the ſun.
                           
                           THe performance of Moſes promiſe generally propounded in the tenth verſe, is here more diſtinctly exemplified. Where firſt the cauſe of Moſes letting downe his hands (whereof Verſ. 11. before) is thus expreſſed, Moſes hands were heavy. 
                              Verſ. 11. When he ſpake of holding up, he uſed the ſingular number, hand: but here making mention of his heavineſſe, he uſeth the plurall number, hands: whereby we are given to underſtand that firſt Moſes lift up one hand, and that waxing weary, he took the rod in the other hand, and lift up that: and ſo continued to change from hand to hand, til both hands were weary. The wearines of Moſes hands is ſet out by the heavines of them. For, if a mans hand be held up long, and ſteddily without ſtirring, it will waxe numne by reaſon of want of bloud, and coldneſſe of that bloud which is. That ſpirit which quickneth the members of a mans body is in the blood: blood failing, or waxing cold, the member for

want of ſpirit, and the vigour thereof, becomes heavy, (as by experience we may obſerve in dead corps:) and heavineſſe of a mans hands makes him weary in holding them up. Wearineſſe then (which is an humane infirmity) was the cauſe of Moſes letting down his hands: whereby, as by an outward ſigne, the weakneſſe of his faith, and fainting of his ſoule and ſpirit is ſet out: as was noted § 42. before.
                           To helpe Moſes infirmity, Aaron and Hur finding a great ſtone (the beſt meanes that in that place they could find for Moſes eaſe) they bring it to the place where he ſtood, and ſo ſet it as he might conveniently ſit upon it, and continue the better to hold up the rod of God: the ſtone was like one of them which Ioſhua cauſed to be ſet in Iordan, a maſſie Ioſ. 4. 9. ſtone. The ſame title is given to them and this.
                           That which ſome alledge, as the end of laying this ſtone 
                                 
                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                 
                               by Moſes, that he might rest his elbow on it, can not well ſtand with this clauſe following in the text, and he ſate thereon.
                           
                           As for means to ſettle his hand, and to make it the more ſteddy, it is added, And Aaron and Hur ſtaid up his hands. They put their hands under his elbow, and by their armes, the one on the one ſide, the other on the other ſide, kept his hands that they could not ſway aſide one way or other.
                           By this externall aſſiſtance, and ſupportance of Moſes hands in regard of his bodily weakneſſe, their joyning of ſpirits with his, their mutuall faithfull prayers are ſignified.
                           Such helpe did the fore-mentioned aſſiſtance bring to Moſes, as his hands which were before ſo heavy and feeble as he was forced to let them fall, remained ſteddy: and that not for an houre or two, but all the day, even untill the going downe of the ſun: which implieth, that his ſpirit was ſo revived by their mutuall and joynt prayers, as with much alacrity, and great ardency he continued to pray all the day long.
                           Here then is declared, The benefit of mutuall prayer.
                           
                           More diſtinctly here is offered to our conſideration,

                              
                                 1. The Need thereof.
                                 The Helpe thereof.
                              
                           
                           The Need is

                                 1. Expreſſed, in theſe words, Moſes hands were heavy.
                                 
                                 2. Exemplified, by the means uſed to ſupply that Need.
                                 
                              
                           
                           The Means were of two ſorts.

                                 1. One for his Body.
                                 
                                 2. Another for his Hand.
                                 
                              
                           
                           The Meanes for his body was a ſtone.
                           
                           In ſetting downe hereof is noted
                                 1. How it was prepared.
                                 
                                 2. How it was uſed.
                                 
                              
                           
                           The Preparation is noted in two actions.
                                 1. They tooke a ſtone.
                                 
                                 2. They put it under him.
                                 
                              
                           
                           The uſe of it is in this phraſe, He ſate thereon.
                           
                           In ſetting downe the means for his hand, is ſhewed,
                                 1. What was done. Aaron and Hur ſtaid up his hands.
                                 
                                 2. How it was done. The one on the one ſide, the other on the other.
                                 
                              
                           
                           The helpe received hereby was perſeverance, and that ſo long as was need. Here then we have,
                                 1. The vigour which Moſes received. His hands were ſteddy.
                                 
                                 2. The continuance thereof. Vntill the going downe of the ſunne.
                                 
                              
                           
                           The weakneſſe here manifeſted in Moſes giveth inſtance, that,
                           
                              The best Saints are ſubject to dulneſſe in pious duties. Hereof before in §. 45.
                           The means uſed to ſupport him in this his weakneſſe, and the benefit received thereby is here eſpecially to be inſiſted upon.
                           Of the Perſons here aſſiſtant to Moſes, which were Aaron and Hur, ſufficient hath beene ſpoken, §. 38, 39, 40.
                           1. The notice and care that Aaron and Hur tooke of, and about Moſes weakneſſe, gives proofe, that,
                                 
                                    
I. Due conſideration is to be taken of one anothers weakeneſſe.
                                 
                              
                           
                           2. The means which they uſe in taking a ſtone, and putting it under him, ſheweth, that,
                                 II. All good meanes must be uſed to ſupport our brothers weakneſſe.
                                 
                              
                           
                           3. Moſes manner of uſing the means (he ſate upon the ſtone) being a geſture not very proper to prayer, yeelds example, that,
                                 III. Mans weakneſſe gaineth diſpenſation for circumſtances in divine matters.
                                 
                              
                           
                           4. The Action of Aaron and Hur, who ſtayed up Moſes hands, affords evidence, that,
                                 IIII. We muſt be are one anothers burdens.
                                 
                              
                           
                           5. The Manner of doing it, One on the one ſide, the other on the other ſide, implieth, that,
                                 V. Vnion of ſpirits is very helpfull.
                                 
                              
                           
                           6. The event following hereupon, that Moſes hands were ſteddy, declares, that,
                                 VI. The weake are ſtrengthened by aid from others.
                                 
                              
                           
                           7. The continuance of all that was done, untill the going downe of the ſun, as it amplifieth the point before mentioned of the ſtrength which they that faint may receive by aid from others, ſo it gives demonſtration, that,
                                 VII. If need require prayer must be long continued.
                                 
                              
                           
                           Herof read The whole Armour of God, on Eph. 6. 18. Treat. 3. Part. 2. §. 98. &amp; Part. 6. §. 137, &amp;c.
                        
                        
                           §. 49. Of conſidering others weakneſſe.
                           I. See §. 48. 
                              DVe conſideration is to be taken of one anothers weakneſſe. Many are the exhortations of Scripture tending hereunto, ſuch as theſe, Phil. 2. 4. 
                              Looke every man alſo on the things of others. 
                              Heb. 10. 24. 
                              Let us conſider one another, &amp;c.
                           The pitifull aſpect which the Luke 10. 30. 
                              Samaritan caſt upon the wounded man commended by the Lord, and the Prieſts and Levites unmercifull paſſing by, reproved in the parable, do

further give good evidence to the equity of the duty.
                           Notice and conſideration of our brothers need is the ground of that compaſſion which may be wrought in our bowels, whereby we are moved to afford the beſt ſuccour that we can. It is oft noted of Chriſt that Mat. 14. 14. Luk. 7 13. he ſaw ſuch and ſuch, and had compaſſion on them. 
                              Ezek. 16. 6. Yea God himſelfe thus expreſſeth the occaſion of that compaſſion which he ſhewed to his Church, When I paſſed by thee, and ſaw thee polluted, &amp;c. God here taketh upon him the affection of man, whereby he ſheweth what may in man move compaſſion.
                           O that men would be watchfull one over another, to obſerve wherein their brother fainteth or faileth, and afford what helpe and ſuccour they can, as Abiſhai did to David, 2 Sam. 21. 15, 16, 17. Herein we ſhould prove as Gods one to another. Thus might Governours do much good to their Subjects, and Subjects againe to their Governours: So Miniſters to their People, and People to their Miniſters: So, Husbands and Wives, Neighbours and Neighbours, Friends and Friends, yea all of all ſorts. We are all one fleſh, mutuall members of one and the ſame body. Let us therefore be of like affection one to another, and as ready to helpe and ſuccour each other, as one member is to ſuccour another. Howſoever Cain moſt un-brotherly, yea very butcherly ſaid, Am I my brothers keeper? yet he ought to have beene his brothers keeper, as all of us are, and therefore as keepers of Gen. 4. 9. one another, we ought to conſider one another.
                        
                        
                           §. 50. Of ſupporting others weakeneſse.
                           II. See §. 48. 
                              ALL good meanes must be uſed to ſupport our brothers weakeneſſe. To this tend ſuch admonitions as theſe. Iſa. 35. 3. 1 Theſ. 5. 14. 
                              Strengthen ye the weake hands, and comfort the feeble knees. Comfort the feeble minded, ſupport the weake. 
                              Act. 20. 35. 
                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                 , &amp;c. Hereunto the Apoſtle puts a muſt, which imports a neceſſity, ye ought (or ye muſt) ſupport the weake. The Greeke word tranſlated, ſupport, is oft uſed for 
                                 
                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                 . Plut. in Fab. under-propping a thing ready to fall: and Luk. 1. 54. Vide Bezoe annot. majores in hunc loc &amp; in Act. 20. 35. for taking one that is weake by

the hand to raiſe him up. A fit Metaphor for the point in hand. That which is noted of Chriſts taking by the hand ſuch as were Mar. 1. 31. 
                              weake, 
                              Mat. 14. 31. 
                              ready to ſinke, yea, and Mar. 5. 41. 
                              dead, when he meant to raiſe them, giveth evidence of the equity of the fore-mentioned duty. God himſelfe doth hereby teſtifie that goodneſſe which is in him, and that care which he taketh of men in their weakneſſe: for, ſaith he, Ezek. 34 16. 
                              I will bind up that which was broken, and wil ſtrengthen ohat which was ſick. Hereupon his people are incouraged in their weakneſſe to ſeeke ſuccour of him: Hoſ. 6. 1, 2. 
                              Come, ſay they, Let us returne unto the Lord: for he will heale us, He will bind us up, he will revive us, He will raiſe us up. In this reſpect the Spirit of God hath this title Ioh. 14. 26. 
                              Comforter, by a kind of property given him. For our better ſtability, Pſal 91. 11. 
                              God hath given his Angels charge over us to keepe us, &amp;c. If thus the Father, Sonne, Holy Ghoſt, and holy Angels be ſo tender over us, as in our weakneſſe to ſupport us, ſhould not we uſe all the good meanes we can to ſuccour and ſupport one another in our weakeneſſes?
                           Many motives there be to preſſe this point. As, Motives to ſuccour one another.
                           
                           1. That propinquity which is betwixt children of men, who are all one fleſh. Hide not therefore thy ſelfe from thine owne fleſh, Iſa. 58. 7.
                           2. That Condition wherein all are, and whereby they are 
                                 Conſiderare debemus, quod aegritudinem ſive animae, ſive corporis, quam in homine alio videmus, etiam nos habere poſſumus. Hoc ergo exhibe amus, &amp;c. Aug. deverb. Apoſt. Serm. 21. ſubject to ſuch neceſſities, as may need others ſuccour. The Apoſtle therefore, where he preſſeth this duty of reſtoring others, inferreth this motive, Conſidering thy ſelfe, leaſt thou alſo be tempted, Gal. 6. 1.
                           3. That humanity which becomes our nature, whereby we give evidence that there are ſuch bowels in us as are moved at others neceſſities. Chriſt therefore tooke unto himſelfe our nature, that he might give evidence thereby that he was mercifull, Heb. 2. 17. It is inhumanity not to be touched with others needs.
                           4. That mercy which is required to be ſhewed to aſſes and oxen, which, lying under their burdens are to be helped up. And are not men more worthy then aſſes or oxen? Exo. 23. 5. Deu. 22. 4.
                           
                              
5. That Sympathy which is in other creatures. Even unreaſonable creatures are ready to run at the cry of ſuch as are of their owne kind. Should reaſonable men have leſſe ſympathy then unreaſonable beaſts? Lam. 4. 3.
                           6. That efficacy of regeneration, which of Wolves, Leopards, Lyons Beares, Aſpes and Cockatrices, maketh Calves, Lambs, Kids, and Children, Iſa. 11. 6, &amp;c.
                           7. That pity and compaſſion, that readineſſe and forwardneſſe that is in God to ſuccour and ſupport us in all our weakneſſes, (whereof before.) Be ye therefore followers of God. Be ye mercifull as your father is mercifull, Eph. 5. 1. Luke 6. 36.
                           By our willingneſſe and readineſſe to ſuccour ſuch as need our ſuccour, we gaine aſſurance and give evidence that our corrupt nature is altered.
                           Do they well conſider the foreſaid Propinquity or Neceſſity 
                              Reproofe of ſuch as neglect the weake and ueedy. whereunto themſelves are ſubject, or common Humanity, or that Mercy which ſhould be ſhewed to beaſts, or have they any naturall Sympathy, or good evidence of their Regeneration, or can they be thought to be children of God like to him, who ſee their brother fall or faint, or thorow infirmity need ſuccour and ſupportance, and yet be no whit moved thereat, nor uſe any means, nor afford any helpe to ſuſtaine and ſupport him? Let ſuch conſider the end of Luk. 16. 21, &amp;c. 
                              Dives, and the Mat. 25. 41, &amp;c. doome denounced againſt thoſe that omitted duties of curteſie, humanity, and charity. Iam. 2. 13. Deriſion and oppreſſion of the weake. 
                              For he ſhall have judgement without mercy that hath ſhewed no mercy.
                           
                           What then may be thought of them that put a ſtumbling block before the weake to make them fall: or being fallen, deride and ſcorne them? The law implieth that there is no fear of God in ſuch: for, where it expreſly ſaith, Thou ſhalt not curſe the deafe, nor put a ſtumbling blocke before the blind, 
                              Lev. 19. 14. it addeth, but ſhalt feare thy God, and thereby implieth, that a true feare of God will keepe men from ſuch inhumanity. This is noted to be the cauſe of the fearfull judgements that fell upon Obad 10, &amp;c. 
                              Edom, and Icr. 48. 27. 
                              Moab; their deriding of Iſrael in her affiction, and oppreſſing her when ſhe was preſſed downe.

                              Gen. 9. 22, &amp;cRemember Cham. 
                              
                                 Vrgere jacentes, aut praecipitantes impellere certè eſt inhumanum. Cic. pro. C Rab. Poſt.The very Heathen counted it an inhumane thing to trample upon thoſe that were throwne down: and to thruſt on thoſe that were tumbling downe headlong.
                           
                              Exhortation to ſuccour the weake. Col. 3. 12.
                              Put on therefore (as the elect of God, holy and beloved) bowels of mercies, kindneſſe, &amp;c. As you ſee the weakneſſe of a brother, do what you can to ſupport him. If he be weary, and cannot ſtand ſo long as he ſhould, let him have ſomthing to ſit thereon, as Aaron and Hur here did to Moſes. And in other caſes, (as Iob was to the unſpeakable comfort of his ſoule when Satan by himſelfe and others did what he could to ſhake his faith, and to deprive him of all comfort in his God) be Iob 29. 15, 16.
                              eyes to the blind, feet to the lame, a father to the poore, &amp;c. Thus, as ye do that which is acceptable to God, and profitable to your brother, ſo alſo that which may be very available to your ſelves. Mat. 7. 2.
                              For, with what meaſure ye mete, it ſhalbe meaſured to you againe. On theſe and ſuch like grounds ſaith the Lord, Mat. 5. 7.
                              Bleſſed are the mercifull, for they ſhall obtaine mercy. Men will be ready on all occaſions to ſhew mercy to ſuch. Thus Ruth who was as a ſtaffe to her old mother in law, found Boaz to be as a ſtaffe to her: and he renders this reaſon of the kindneſſe he ſhewed to her, Rut. 2. 11.
                              It hath fully beene ſhewed me all that thou haſt done to thy mother in law ſince the death of thine husband. But, if men ſhould forget, or not reſpect the kindneſſe and goodneſſe that is ſhewed to ſuch as are in need, God will aſſuredly recompence it: as he recompenced the kindneſſe which Ioſeph ſhewed to Pharoahs Butler,
                              Gen. 40. 23. and which David ſhewed to Nabal,
                              1 Sam. 25. 10. though the one was forgotten, and the other not reſpected. With the mercifull God will ſhew himſelfe mercifull. 
                              Psal. 18. 25.

                           III. See § 48. 
                              MAns weakneſſe gaineth diſpenſation for circumſtances in divine matters. Thus Gen. 47. 31. 
                              Iacob being old and weake worſhipped God in his bed, manifeſted by his bowing of himſelf upon the beds head, and was therein accepted. For, it is ſaid that he did it Heb. 11. 21. 
                              in faith. Thus the Ioſ. 5. 5. 
                              Iſraelites all the while they were in the wilderneſſe (Num. 9. 17. Where they were on a ſudden, whenſoever the cloud aroſe, to remove from place to place) had a diſpenſation for circumciſion. Thus 1 Sam. 21. 6. 
                              David in his need had a diſpenſation to eat the ſhew-bread: And —1. 22. 
                              Hannah to tarrie at home, and not to go to the Temple while ſhe gave her child ſucke. But to ceaſe from reckoning up more particular inſtances, this generall manifeſtation of Gods mind concerning mercy, (g I deſire 
                              Hoſ. 6. 6. Mat. 12. 7. Per hoc ubi ſcriptum eſt, miſericordiam magis volo quam ſacrificium, nihil aliud quam ſacrificio ſacrificium praelatum oportet intelligi: quoniam illud quod ab hominibus appellatur ſacrificium, ſignum eſt veri ſacrificij. Porro autem miſericordia verum ſacrificium eſt. Aug. de Civ. Dei. l, 20. c. 5. 
                              mercy and not ſacrifice) gives good warrant for the foreſaid diſpenſation. For by ſacrifice he meaneth externall rites and ordinances, wherein and whereby worſhip is performed to God: by mercy, ſuch ſubſtantiall duties as tend to mans good. Thus he prefers ſacrifice to ſacrifice. Sacrifice conſiſting on externall rites, to ſacrifice of ſubſtantiall duties: which are to do good, and to ſhew mercy. With ſuch ſacrifices God is well pleaſed, Heb. 13. 16. Theſe therfore are the true ſacrifices.
                           All externall rites are ordained eſpecially for mans helpe and good. If therefore they ſtand in oppoſition to it, or hinder it, they faile of their maine end, and ſo are not of that uſe for which they are ordained: and thereupon give place, and have a diſpenſation to be omitted.
                           
                              Ob. This is to preferre the ſecond Table before the firſt, and conſequently man before God.
                           
                              Anſw. Nothing leſſe. For, the ſubſtance of the firſt Table gives not place to the ſubſtance of the ſecond. but the circumſtance of the firſt to the ſubſtance of the ſecond. Indeed if the ſubſtance of each Table ſhould come in oppoſition, the ſecond Table ſhould give place. Inſtance Abrahams readines

to ſacrifice his ſonne at Gods command. (Gen. 22. 2, &amp;c.) For, obedience to Gods expreſſe charge is of the ſubſtance of the firſt Table. Saul therefore in ſparing Agag, though it might ſeeme to be a worke of mercy, ſinned. For, this indeed is to preferre man before God, 1 Sam. 15. 23.
                           The pretence which hypocrites make of piety in a diligent Hypocrites taxed. obſervation of the externall rites appertaining thereto, and yet in the meane while regard neither mercy nor juſtice, is hereby manifeſted to be a very vaine pretence. Chriſt denounceth a woe againſt ſuch as devoure widowes houſes, and for a pretence make long prayers, Mat. 23. 14. The thouſands of rams, and ten-thouſands of rivers of oyle offered by ſuch hypocrites are nothing in Gods ſight. To do juſtly, and to love mercy is that which the Lord requireth, and which is much more acceptable to him, Mic. 6. 7, 8.
                           For our parts, let it be our care firſt to put difference betwixt circumſtance and ſubſtance: and then to preferre this to that. For this end we muſt labour to have our underſtanding well enlightned by Gods Word, and our hearts filled with an holy feare of God, and true love of man. Thus ſhall we diſcerne what is to be preferred before other, and ſo wiſely order the things we do, as our brother may be pleaſured, our ſelves not prejudiced, and God beſt pleaſed. It is an evidence of Gods great and good reſpect to man, thus to give a diſpenſation in matters concerning himſelfe, for mans good. As occaſion is offered either in regard of our owne or others need, let us wiſely make uſe thereof. God would have us uſe that liberty which in his goodneſſe and wiſdome he is pleaſed to grant us. Thus may ſicke perſons pray in their bed, (Iſa. 38. 2.) or if they cannot themſelves pray, have others to pray for them, (Iam. 5. 14.) and weake perſons not well able to kneele, pray ſitting, as here Moſes did: and they that cannot come to Church, have the benefit of Gods ordinances at home.

And againe, 2 Cor. 11. 28, 29. 
                              There commeth upon me daily the care of all the Churches. Who is weake and I am not weake? who is offended and I burne not?

                           2. It is ſuch a work of charity as we our ſelves may ſtand in need of, Gal. 6. 1. A lion may ſtand in need of the helpe of a mouſe to gnaw aſunder the cord wherewith he is hampered. Moſes a worthy one, here needs the ſupportance of others.
                           3. It is ſuch a worke of charity as may raiſe men ready to fall, and ſo helpe them in the way that leadeth to eternall life, and bring them thither where none ſhalbe preſſed with any burden at all.
                           4. Hereby as by a means we our ſelves may attaine to that life. For, God himſelfe is ready to eaſe thoſe of all their burdens, even of thoſe burdens that would preſſe them downe to hell, whom he obſerves to be forward in eaſing their brethren of their burdens. Thus will that of Chriſt be verified, Bleſſed are the mercifull for they ſhall obtaine mercy, Mat. 5. 7.
                           
                              
That this duty may be the better performed, due conſideration is to be taken of one anothers weakeneſſe, whereof before, §. 49.

                              VNion of ſpirits is very helpfull. This is true of all things wherein men have occaſion to deale together. As Councellers of State in matters of State: Iudges in matters of juſtice and equity: Miniſters in matters of religion: Phyſitians in phyſick for mens bodies: Artizens in matters of their trades: and ſo others in other affaires: but eſpecially Believers in the holy and heavenly duty of prayer. This is it which in this place is eſpecially intended. For mutuall helpe herein, Chriſtians in the Primitive Church, even in the firſt and beſt times thereof, are ſaid to continue 
                              Act. 2 46.

                              daily with one accord in the Temple. The Temple was the houſe of prayer. There therefore they prayed, and that with one accord: that is, with one ſpirit, one mind, and one heart. Thus it is againe ſaid, Act. 4. 24. that they lift up their voice with one accord: their ſpirits were joyned together, and as one ſpirit in that powerfull prayer which they made. When many ſo conſent together, in the Hebrew dialect they are ſaid to be Iudg. 20. 1. Neh 8. 1.

                              as one man: becauſe their minds did ſo conſent, as if they had not beene the minds of many, but the mind of one man. Daniel well knew the benefit of union of ſpirits in prayer, Dan. 2. 17. So Eſter 4. 16. Ioel 2. 16.
                           1. Vnion of ſpirits is like the gathering together of many fagots, which make a fire the more fierce: or like much powder laid together, which ſends forth a bullet much further then otherwiſe it would flie. Thus many ſpirits united make prayer much more fervent, and force it the higher, even as high as God is. To cry mightily unto God, the King of Nineveh cauſed all his people with one accord to pray Ion. 2. 8. When the Chriſtians prayed with one accord, the place was ſhaken where they were aſſembled together (Act. 4. 24, 31.) to ſhew the ſpirituall violence of ſuch prayer.
                           
                              
2. Prayer is as ſweet incenſe, Pſal. 141. 2. Vnion of ſpirits therein, is as the mixing of many ſweet ſpices, which cauſe the more fragrant ſavour. Yea, this union is as an harmony of many voices or inſtruments, which make the muſick much more melodious. Mat. 18. 19.

God, who hath enjoyned this means of helping and ſupporting one another, will give his bleſſing thereunto when it is rightly uſed: and what God bleſſeth ſhalbe effectuall to that whereunto it is uſed: ſo as in faith we may expect a good iſſue from our endeavours in this kind.
                           As this effect which uſeth to ariſe from that mutuall help and ſuccour that is offered to ſuch as are weake, aggravateth their inhumanity who refuſe or neglect to do what they might for ſtrengthening the weake, and eſtabliſhing the feeble, (for, if thorow want of helpe they fall and periſh, they, who might have reſtored and ſet them up, make themſelves acceſſary to their deſtruction;) ſo it is a very forcible motive to provoke us with all care, diligence, &amp; good conſcience to performe the fore named duties of §. 48.

It is reported of Harts, that by ones bearing up anothers head, which is by reaſon of their hornes ſo heavy, as it would drowne them in the ſea, they are enabled ſafely to ſwim over the ſea, till they come to firme land. For, they uſe ſo to diſpoſe themſelves, as the latter laieth his head on the formers hind parts. And becauſe it is neceſſary that one of them be firſt, that firſt after he hath ſome while led the reſt, commeth behind all: and in like manner do the reſt in their courſe.

                              See §. 1,THe ſucceſſe of all before noted is in this verſe ſet down. It was a glorious Conquest. 
                           
                           The Conquerour is here ſaid to be the fore-mentioned Ioſhua. He being the Generall of the victorious army, the victory is by a Synechdoche, attributed to him. The Generall is put for the whole army under his command: as it uſeth in other places of holy writ, yea and in other Hiſtoriographers to be.

                              diſcomfited) whereby the victory is expreſſed, ſignifieth ſo to overthrow one as he is not able to riſe againe. The

                               Hebrewes do ſet out the meaning of it by a word that ſignifieth to break to peeces.

                           The enemies ſubdued are compriſed under this collective word Amalek, whereof § 2. before. By his people, are meant ſuch as tooke part with the King, or chiefe heads of the Amalakites: whether they were of the ſame or another ſtock. This clauſe, His people, is added to ſhew that they who had any hand in his unjuſt warre, had their ſhare in the juſt vengeance.
                           The inſtrument wherewith they were puniſhed is here ſaid to be the edge of the ſword, or word for word, 
                                 
                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                 
                               
                              the mouth of the ſword. For as a mouth devoureth that which entreth into it, ſo a ſword by the ſharpe edge of it deſtroyeth that which is ſtrucken with it. Therefore the very name of 
                                 
                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                  
                                 Gladius. Vaſtitas. Deſolatio.
                               
                              a ſword in Hebrew ſignifieth deſtruction: and a ſword is ſaid to 2 Sam. 2. 26.—11. 25. 
                              devoure.
                           
                           
                              
The ſetting out of this ſucceſſe pointeth out five obſervable points.
                           I. The iſſue of warre is eſpecially attributed to the Generall. For, onely Ioſhua the Generall is here mentioned, he is ſaid to vanquiſh the enemy.
                           II. Lawfull warre well waged proves proſperous. The ſucceſſe expreſſed by Ioſhua's diſcomfiting the enemy ſheweth that this warre was proſperous. And in Scripture the ſucceſſe which God gave to his Church of old is recorded, to ſhew what his Church in ſucceeding ages may in like caſes expect.
                           III. They that first begin warre may have the worst in warre. For, Amalek firſt began, and Amalek was diſcomfited.
                           IIII. Acceſſaries make themſelves liable to the judgement that falls on the Principall. For, the people, even they that tooke part with Amalek, are deſtroyed, as well as Amalek.
                           
                           V. Enemies in warre may lawfully be ſlaine. For, this expreſſion of the inſtrument wherewith they were diſcomfited (with the edge of the ſword) ſheweth that they were ſlain: and that which was here done by Ioſhua, was lawfully done. God approved it.
                        
                        
                           §. 56. Of attributing ſucceſſe in warre to Generals.
                           I. See §. 55. 
                              THe iſſue of war is eſpecially attributed to Generals. 
                              Gen. 14. 19. 
                              Melchizedek bleſſed Abraham onely, for the victory which he with his confederates obtained. The many and great conqueſts which were made under Ioſ. 10 41. 
                              Ioſhua and 2 Sam 8. 1, &amp;c 
                              David are attributed to them alone. Many more like inſtances might be given out of ſacred writ and other hiſtories. The pompous triumphs which Generals made among the Graecians, Romans, and other nations give evidence hereunto.
                           The proweſſe, courage, wiſdome, and other like warlike What depends on good Generals.
                               vertues of Generals and Commanders, make much, under the

divine providence to the obtaining of victory. The marſhalling of the army dependeth wholly on their direction. They at their diſcretion cauſe alarms or retraits to be ſounded. By their example, by their encouragements or diſcouragements, the whole army is much animated or daunted. Hence is it that a good Generall is accounted 2 Sam. 18. 3. Chab

                              worth ten thouſand others. The name of an experienced and victorious Generall hath oft frighted the enemies. Yea, it is ſaid, that an army of Staggs whoſe Generall is a Lion, is better then an army of Lions whoſe Generall is a Stagge. We read therefore that after God had raiſed up a Iudge to deliver Iſrael, and that the Iudge had given proofe of his valour, Iudg. 3. 11, 30—8. 28. 
                              the land had reſt all his daies: whereby is implied that the enemy durſt not take up armes againſt him. Terrible was the name of Ioſhua to the Canaanites, of David to the Philistines, of Iehu to the Achabites, of Hazael to the Iſraelites, of the Machabites to the Nations, of Achilles to the Trojans, of Hector to the Graecians, of Cyrus to the Babylonians, of Alexander to the Perſians, of Epaminondas to the Macedonians, of the Scipioes to the Carthaginians, of Hanibal to the Romans, of Caeſar to the Gauls, of Scanderbeg to the Turks, of the Black Prince to the French, and ſo of other valiant Generals to their enemies.
                           
                           
                              Generals in this reſpect have more then ordinary need of wiſdome, watchfulneſſe, proweſſe, juſtice, temperance, induſtry, What requiſite for good Generals. and other like warlike vertues. Yea alſo of all others it behoveth them to be at peace with God, to have faith in him, as Heb. 11. 32. 
                              Ioſhua, Gedeon, Baruk, Sampſon, Iephte, David, and other pious and victorious Generals had. For, ſo great matters lying on them, as hath before beene noted, ſo much being expected from them, and ſo much attributed to them, in caſe the battels which under them are fought, have good ſucceſſe, great reaſon that they eſpecially be fitted with all things, that (as means) may produce a good iſſue.
                           It is alſo an eſpeciall point of prudence for Princes and Military exerciſes to be maintained. States to maintaine Artilery and Military exerciſes, not onely in time of warre, but at all other times, though never ſo

peaceable, that ſo men might be fitted to be Generals, and

But of theſe Artilery exerciſes I have The Dignity of Chivalry. elſwhere more largely ſpoken.

                              LAwfull warre well waged proves proſperous. Many many inſtances out of holy writ may be produced for proofe of the truth hereof: but not one I dare boldly ſay, to the contrary. We do indeed oft read of many wars, wherein the better have had the worſe, and the wicked have devoured men more righteous them themſelves. But it hath been either becauſe thoſe better have undertaken warres not warrantable, or els not well waged the ſame. The warre which Iehoſaphat undertooke with Ahab, was not warrantable: For, beſide that 2 Chro. 19. 2. 
                              He ſhould not have helped the ungodly, 
                              —18. 14, &amp;c. a Prophet foretold him that God liked not that warre. —35. 20, &amp;c. Lawfull wars not wel waged The warre alſo that Ioſiah undertooke againſt Pharaoh Nechoh was unlawfull. For, Nechoh intended no evill againſt him. No marvell therefore that the warre of the one and other, though otherwiſe they were good men, was unproſperous. The like may be ſaid of the batteli betwixt Amaziah and Ioaſh, wherein Amaziah, who in meere pride without juſt cauſe provoked Ioaſh to fight, was overthrowne. But Ioſ. 7. 10, &amp;c. the warre which Ioſhua waged againſt the men of Ai, though lawfull in the kind of it, was not well ordered, becauſe he did not before he entred the field, ſearch his army to ſee whether any accurſed thing were therein, or no. Nor was Iud. 20. 21, &amp;c the lawfull warre of the Iſraelites againſt the Benjamites well ordered, becauſe they went about to puniſh ſinne in

others before they had purged their owne ſoules of ſinne. 1 Chro. 10. 13 
                              Saul before he entred into that battell wherein he and his ſonnes and many of the Iſraelites were ſlaine, asked counſell of one that had a familiar ſpirit and not of the Lord. 
                              2 Chro. 36. 13. Ezek. 17. 18. 
                              Zedekiah perfidiouſly and perjuriouſly maintained war againſt Nebuchadnezar, &amp; was overthrown. If a view be taken of all thoſe wars wherin Gods people have bin foiled by their enemies 
                                 Quos arma &amp; equi, &amp; milites, &amp; machinamenta capere non potuerunt, hos peccati natura vinctos hoſtibus tradidit. Chryſ. Hom. 7. in 1 Tim. 2. Why warres proſperous. at any time, by diligent ſearch it may be found, that ſom fault or other in Gods people hath beene the cauſe that they have beene given over into the power of their enemies. Such as armes, and horſes, and ſouldiers, and engines could not overcome, ſinne hath delivered (as bound) to the enemy. But whenſoever they well ordered juſt warres they alwaies proſpered.
                           In ſuch warres Gods honour is engaged: ſo as his people if they ſhould be foiled, might juſtly ſay unto him, What wilt thou do unto thy great name? Ioſ. 7. 9.
                           They who in their war expect good ſucceſſe (and who Iuſt wars to be undertaken. goeth to war that expecteth not good ſucceſſe?) let them firſt be ſure that their war be juſt and warrantable, and then very circumſpect in the maner of waging it: that that which is lawfull may be lawfully proſecuted. Thus may they confidently promiſe unto themſelves victory. True it is, that when Heathen with Heathen, Idolaters with Idolaters, wicked men with wicked men make warre, the iſſue of warre is

But in his peoples wars the caſe is otherwiſe, in caſe they go along with him, and fight not without good warrant from him, nor ſwerve from the directions which he preſcribeth to them.

That which was once viſibly repreſented to Ioſhua, is alwayes really performed in all ſuch warres, The Lord is the chiefe Captaine and Generall in them. In faith therefore may ſuch warres be waged, and with confidence may good ſucceſſe in them be expected.

I ſay, may have, becauſe there may be juſt cauſe of beginning warre, and anſwerably God gives good ſucceſſe thereto: ſo as it cannot be generally ſaid, that all in all caſes that firſt begin warre go by the loſſe. Experience of all times gives evidence againſt this. But yet that this may ſo fall out, like experience giveth demonſtration. Inſtance Num. 21. 23, 33.

Had the fore-wit of the Aramites beene as good as their after-wit, many thouſands of them had ſaved their lives: for, after two overthrowes it is ſaid, the Aramites feared to helpe the children of Ammon any more. This had almoſt coſt Iehoſaphat his life. Sharply therefore was he reproved by the Prophet.
                        
                        
                           §. 60. Of the lawfulneſſe of ſhedding bloud in warre.

                              ENemies in warre may lawfully be ſlaine. If Gods command, Saints practice, Gods approbation, and remuneration, yea and his vengeance on them that ſpared ſuch enemies as ſhould have beene ſlaine, be ſufficient warrant, ſufficient warrant is not wanting for this point.

                              they have, and ſpare them not, but ſlay both man and woman, &amp;c. And the Lord himſelfe, Ezek. 9. 6. 
                              ſlay utterly old and yong.

                           3. For Gods approbation, we have a memorable inſtance thereof by the miniſtry of Melchizedek, a Prieſt of God, Heb. 7. 1. who met Abraham as he returned from the ſlaughter of the Kings, and bleſſed him.

                           5. For Gods vengeance on ſuch as did not ſlay thoſe enemies that ſhould have been ſlaine, there is inſtance in 1 Sam. 15. 13 19. 
                              Saul, and 1 King 20. 42 
                              Ahab.
                           
                           When enemies are ſlaine, it is in a defenſive or offenſive warre. If in defenſive warre, then there is no other way to preſerve our owne lives from ſuch as band themſelves together in armes but by ſlaying them. They ſhew that they ſeeke the lives of them againſt whom they come. The ſlaughter therefore of enemies is but a preſervation of our owne lives. And the bloud which in defenſive warre is ſhed, is ſhed ſe defendendo, in defending ones ſelfe: which was never counted unlawfull. Such are a cauſe of their own death. And he that is the cauſe of death is more infault then 
                                 Qui cauſa mortis eſt, potius in culpâ eſt quam iile qui occidit. Aug. Macedon. Epiſt. 54. he that killeth.
                           As for offenſive warre when it is rightly undertaken, it is either for ſome unſufferable wrong done, or for juſt feare of wrong in time to come. In ſuch a caſe, warre is a publique execution of juſtice. So that it is as lawfull in theſe caſes for ſouldiers to ſlay true enemies, as for executioners to put to death malefactors, arraigned, condemned, and delivered to them for that end.
                           Beſides, by ſlaughter of enemies, the land againſt which they are enemies hath reſt, and ſecurity: as towns and high waies are ſafe and quiet by executing theeves. This effect of

deſtroying enemies is oft noted in Scripture, Iudg. 3. 10, 11, 
                                 Cum homo ab homine occiditur, multum diſtat utrum fiat nocendi cnpiditate, vel injuſtè aliquid auferendi, ſicut à latrone, an ulciſc endi vel obediendi ordine, ſicut à judice, ſicut à car

Thus juſt and due cauſes of ſlaying enemies muſt rightly be obſerved. For, when one man is kild of another, there is great difference, whether it be done with a deſire of wrong and robbery, as theeves do, or in courſe of puniſhment and obedience to law as Iudges and executioners do, or thorow neceſſity of avoiding danger, and affording ſuccour, as ſouldiers do.
                           
                              Ob. David ſeemeth to be branded for ſlaying ſo many enemies as he did. For, as a reaſon why he was not thought fit to build the Temple, it is ſaid to him, Thou haſt ſhed bloud abundantly, and haſt made great warres, &amp;c. Thou haſt beene a man of warre, and ſhed blouds. 1 Chro. 22. 8. &amp; 28. 3.
                           
                              Anſw. This is not upbraided to David as a crime, or as a matter of ignominy. For, it was his glory that he 1 Sam. 25. 28. 
                              fought the Lords battels; and Heb. 11. 32. for that he is put into the catalogue of Gods Worthies. But firſt thereby is implied that David could not have ſuch leaſure as was meet for ſo great a work as the Temple was: which is more fully expreſſed by Salomon in theſe words, 1 King. 5. 3. 
                              David my father could not build an houſe unto the name of the Lord his God, for the warres which were about him on every ſide, &amp;c.
                           2. The building of that Temple was a type of the building of the ſpirituall Temple, the Church of Chriſt. The builder thereof muſt be an anſwerable type of the builder of the ſpirituall Temple, who was Iſa. 9. 6. 
                              the Prince of peace. Thus Souldiers need not be daunted at the bloud which they ſhed in warre. much doth God himſelfe thus intimate to David: 
                              1 Chro. 22. 9, 10. 
                              A ſonne ſhalbe borne to thee which ſhalbe a man of reſt, &amp;c. He ſhall build an houſe for my name, &amp;c.
                           The good warrant which ſouldiers have for ſlaying their enemies in warre, giveth good encouragement to them for 
                                 Miles hoſtem, &amp; judex, vel Miniſter ejus, n
                                       •

And though by their valour much bloud may be ſhed, yet they need not be any more daunted thereat, then Iudges, Iuries, Executioners, and other Miniſters of Iuſtice for putting many malefactors to death. Souldiers are no more guilty of bloud in ſlaying enemies in warre, then Miniſters of Iuſtice in

putting capitall malefactors to death. It is indeed a matter of pity, and it ought to move our bowels of compaſſion that people ſhould be ſo wicked and deſperate, as to give occaſion to have their bloud ſhed: but, the occaſion being given, Deut. 13. 8.—19. 13. pity muſt be laid aſide. Ier. 13 14. Ezek. 5 11. Zec. 11. 6. God himſelfe in ſuch caſes caſteth off pity. Wherefore, ſhedding of bloud in juſt warre is ſo far from unlawfull cruelty, as it is a point of moſt warrantable equity. Pity in this caſe may prove the ruine of the citie: and more prejudiciall to a State, then tolerating theeves, murtherers, traiters, and ſuch other pernicious malefactors.
                           Onely that which is lawfull muſt lawfully be uſed: to Directions about killing enemies. which end receive theſe few directions.
                           1. Shew that thou delighteſt not in bloud. Shed no more then of neceſſity (thorow the obſtinacy of enemies) thou art 
                                 Pagani necandi non eſſent, ſi quomodo aliter poſſent à nimiâ infeſtatione, ſeu oppreſſione fidelium cohiberi. Bern. ad Mil. Temp. cap 3. Magnum Babyloniae crudelitatis indicium eſt, ne ſenibus quidem peperciſſe: quorum aetas etian, interhoſtes venerabilis eſt. Hier. Com in Iſa. 46 In what caſes no mercy to any. forced to ſhed. If enemies yeeld, and relinquiſh their hoſtility, ſpare them. Read the charge which the divine law giveth to this purpoſe, Deut. 20. 11.
                           2. Slay not ſuch as cannot hurt thee, as weake women, aged men, and young children. This exception the Law expreſſy maketh, Deut. 20. 14.
                           
                              Ob. In other places Gods people are commanded to ſlay men and women, infant and ſuckling, 1 Sam. 15. 3. Anſwerably the Iſraelites dealt with many of their enemies, They utterly deſtroyed all, both man and woman, young and old, &amp;c. Ioſ. 6. 21.
                           
                              Anſw. 1. Particular charges make extraordinary caſes: as Gen. 22 2. the charge given to Abraham for ſacrificing his ſonne. Extraordinary caſes are not exemplary. They are rather matters of admiration then imitation.
                           2. The people who were ſo to be dealt withall were by God devoted to utter deſtruction: Some, becauſe their land was given by the ſupreme poſſeſſour of heaven and earth for an inheritance to his people. The Law therefore that ſpeaketh of ſparing enemies, hath this exception, Deut 20. 16. 
                              But of the cities of thoſe people which the Lord thy God doth give thee for inheritance, thou ſhalt ſave alive nothing that breatheth. Others

were devoted to deſtruction becauſe of their implacable hatred, unſatiable wrath, and intolerable wrongs againſt the people of God: As Exo 17. 14. Deut. 25. 17, 18, 19. 1 Sam. 15. 2, 3. 
                              Amalek.
                           
                           3. If enemies will hearken to no conditions of peace: but obſtinately ſtand out to the very uttermoſt, in ſuch a caſe ſaith the Law, Deut. 20. 13. Cur iraſceretur Deus adverſus Chaldaeos quos ipſe miſit ad capiendum Iſrael? Reſpondit, illos abuſos eſſe crudelitate ſuá &amp; plus impoſuiſſe plagarum, quam Dei ultio flagitabat. Hier. Comment. in Iſa. 46. In what caſes enemies may be tortured. 
                              Thou ſhalt ſmite every male with the edge of the ſword.
                           
                           3. Put not thoſe whom thou flayeſt to exquiſite torments. God proteſteth againſt the Syrians (Am. 1. 3.) for their cruelty, in that having overcome Gilead, they threſhed the inhabitants thereof with threſhing instruments of iron: and againſt the Ammonites, who ript up the women with child of Gilead, Am. 1. 13.
                           
                              Queſt, May not enemies in any caſe be tortured?
                           
                              Anſw. Yes. 1. In caſe of queſtion: when otherwiſe they will not confeſſe the truth.
                           2. In caſe of talio, or requiting like for like: as Iudg. 1. 6, 7. 
                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                 . Radamanthi jus, ut Ariſt. Eth. l. 5. c. 8. the Iſraelites dealt with Adonibezek, whoſe thumbs and great toes they cut off. For ſo had he done to threeſcore and ten Kings before.
                           3. In caſe of revenging unſupportable inſolences and injuries. Hereby was 2 Sam. 12. 31. 
                              David moved to put the Ammonites under ſawes and harrowes of iron, &amp;c. For they had —10. 4. Villanouſly entreated the Ambaſſadors whom David in kindnes had ſent unto them: which was an inſolency againſt the law of nations.
                           4. In caſe of treachery, perjury, and breach of fidelity. For this cauſe Ier. 39. 6, 7. 
                              Nebuchadnezzar ſlew the ſonnes of Zedekiah before his eyes, and then put out his eyes.
                           
                           4. What thou doeſt againſt thine enemies do in love. 4. Slay in love Love their perſons though thou hate their practiſes. Mat. 5. 44. Pray therefore for them. Pray that God would turne their hearts, and move them to ceaſe from their hoſtility, or pardon their ſin. Thus pious Magiſtrates will pray for the ſalvation of their ſoules whoſe bodies they adjudge to death. 5. Avenge not thy ſelfe.
                           
                           5. Take heed of making that publique execution of juſtice an occaſion of executing private revenge: 2 Sam. 3. 27, 29. So

dealt Ioab with Abner, 
                              1 King. 2. 32. which pulled vengeance on Ioabs head.

                              And the LORD ſaid unto Moſes, Write this for a memoriall in a booke, rehearſe it in the eares of Ioſhua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.
                           
                           THe See §. 1. Event following on the fore-named victory, remaineth to be handled. It was a Memoriall thereof: and that of two kinds. One enjoyned by God. The other made by Moſes. The former of theſe is here noted in this 14. verſe: which conſiſteth of two parts.
                                 1. To make a Memoriall of it.
                                 2. To rehearſe it before Ioſhua.
                                 
                              
                           
                           The primary and principall Authour of the memoriall here mentioned, is Iehovah, the LORD; The Miniſter is Moſes, of whom we have ſpoken on the 9. Verſe.
                           This charge was here given to him, becauſe he was the Lords Prophet to the people, and the Recorder of Canonicall Scripture at that time.
                           The meanes of making this a memoriall is writing it in a 
                              Benefits of writing things 
                              booke. Things written remaine. Herein lieth a difference betwixt ſpeaking and writing, that things uttered by Vox audita perit, littera ſcripta manet. ſpeech, if they be not at the time of uttering faſt laid up in a ſtrong memory, they vaniſh in the aire; or if they be not remembred, they onely who are then preſent when they are uttered, have the benefit of that uttering. But things written remaine againe and againe to be read: to be read by thoſe that are preſent at the writing, or farre abſent: yea, not only at that time but in future ages. Thus, that the covenant which the Iſraelites made with God might not vaniſh with

the making of it, Neh. 9. 38. they write it. And that all people neare at hand and farre off might take notice of the decree both for deſtroying, and alſo for reſcuing the Iewes, the Est. 3. 12. 
                              one, and the —8. 9. 
                              other decree were both written. And that future ages might reape benefit by the mercy of God manifeſted in former ages, it is ſaid, Pſal. 102. 18. 
                              This ſhalbe written for the generation to come.
                           
                           Writing is then eſpecially of uſe in the fore-named reſpects, when things are written in a booke. Looſe papers are like looſe broomes: ſoone ſcattered and of little uſe. But bookes are of ſheets of paper rolled, and bound up together: ſo as they may eaſily, and are ordinarily kept yeare after yeare, age after age.
                           
                              Q. What booke may this be thought to be?
                           
                              Anſw. Becauſe it is not expreſly ſet downe, mens conjectures thereabouts are various. Toſtatus Quaeſt. in hunc loc. Some think that it was the book of the warres of God, mentioned, Num. 21. 14. Or the book of Iaſher, mentioned 2 Sam. 1. 18. which they ſuppoſe to be one and the ſame booke. Oſian de Others, that it was a booke then extant, but now loſt. The notes in the former Engliſh tranſlation take it to be the book of the law: meaning therby, as I take it, this very booke of Exodus. So do Tuis Commentarijs de rebus iſtis: ut infr. 34. 27. &amp; Deut. 31. 9. Trem. &amp; Iun. in annot. in hunc loc. Sic ferè Calvin Simler. &amp; alij. other judicious Expoſitors take it.

                              memoriall is added to ſhew the end why God would have this hiſtory written: namely, to be read of their poſterity: that thereby they might have before them an evidence of Amaleks malice againſt them: and of Gods goodneſſe towards them.
                           The other part of Gods charge is to rehearſe that which was to be regiſtred before Ioſhua.

Iun.Word for word, Put into the eares of Ioſhua; meaning thereby that Moſes ſhould oft inſtruct Ioſhua in this evidence of Gods protection of his people from ſuch a malicious enemy as Amalek was. For, God would that Ioſhua ſhould ſucceed Moſes: and that

                              Ioſhua ſhould root out the nations which inhabited the land that God gave to the Iſraelites: and therefore for his encouragement he would have him oft to ſet before him this victory.
                           A more particular reaſon of the foreſaid memoriall is rendred by God himſelfe in the words following, as the firſt particle being a cauſall conjunction importeth (

                              I will wipe Ieruſalem, as a man wipeth a diſh: wiping it, and turning it up ſide downe. Here the city is reſembled to a diſh, the inhabitants thereof to the filth that cleaveth therto, when ſuch inhabitants are deſtroyed, the city is ſaid to be wiped of them. Gen. 7. 23. It is alſo applied to Gods wiping or ſweeping away the whole world with the floud. And to Iſa. 43. 25. Gods wiping away our ſinnes: which are as thorowly taken away as any thing can be. The word therefore it ſelfe implieth an utter extirpation, or deſolation. But the kind of phraſe addeth much emphaſis thereto, which is this, in wiping away I will

                              wipe away. Our Engliſh not unfitly thus expreſſeth it, I will utterly put out.
                           
                           What is it that ſhall ſo utterly be put out? Not ſome of the meaner ſort: not ſuch as riſe up in armes: not ſome of the chiefeſt: not ſome of one ſort, or ſome of another onely: but Amalek: the whole ſtock, the whole nation: and that ſo thorowly, ſo utterly, as none ſhalbe preſerved to reſerve and raiſe up their name againe. Therefore God ſaith, I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek. And that not only out of that part of the earth where they then lived, but

Here have we in Summe, A manifeſtation of Gods indignation againſt malicious enemies of his Church.

                                 1. By writing it.

                           The Revenge is aggravated by the

                                 Kind. Put out the remembrance.

                           From this Manifeſtation of Gods indignation, as it is here deſcribed, ten eſpeciall points of inſtruction may be collected.
                           1. The Principall Perſon that firſt appointeth this Record, the LORD, ſheweth, that,
                           
                              I. God of old was the authour of records.
                              
                           
                           2. The Miniſter, Moſes, giveth inſtance, that,
                           
                              II. God uſeth mans Miniſtry in preſerving records for his Church.
                              
                           
                           
                              
3. The action enjoyned, Write this, proveth, that,
                           
                              III. Memorable matters are to be registred.
                              
                           
                           4. The Instrument wherein it was to be written, a booke, declares, that,
                           
                              IIII. Publique records are to be ſafe kept.
                              
                           
                           5. The End why this is to be written, (for a memoriall) argueth, that,
                           
                              V. Iudgements on enemies of the Church are to be kept in memory.
                              
                           
                           6. The other part of the charge, concerning the rehearſing of that which was regiſtred, implieth, that,
                           
                              VI. Matters worth record must be rehearſed.
                              
                           
                           7. The Perſon to whom that which was written muſt be rehearſed (in the eares of Ioſhua) intimateth, that,
                           
                              VII. Governours of Gods Church muſt eſpecially be acquainted with Gods former dealings.
                              
                           
                           8. The chiefe Author of the judgement here mentioned (I will, ſaith the Lord) giveth evidence, that,
                           
                              VIII. It is God that avengeth.
                              
                           
                           9. The kind of judgement (put out the remembrance) importeth, that,
                           
                              IX. God may be provoked to the utter ruine of a people.
                              
                           
                           10. The extent of this judgement (from under heaven) evinceth, that,
                           
                              X. There is no place of ſafety from Gods revenge.

                              GOD of old was the Author of records. This is true of the moſt ancient, admirable, approved, and every way the beſt records that ever were: which 
                                 
                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                 . 
                              by an excellency and ſuper-eminency are called Mat. 21. 42. 
                              Scriptures, 
                              Rom. 1. 2. 
                              Holy Scriptures. For of them ſaith an Apoſtle, 2 Tim. 3. 16. 
                              All Scripture is given by inſpiration of God: and another, 2 Pet. 1. 19, 21 
                              No propheſie in Scripture is of any private motion, &amp;c. but holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.
                           
                           God would have, not the preſent age onely, but alſo all

ſucceeding ages to reape benefit by the evidences of his wiſdome, power, mercy, juſtice, and other his divine properties: and therefore cauſed the records of them to be written. This the Holy Ghoſt expreſly noteth, ſaying, Rom 4 23, 24. 
                              It was written for us. 
                              1 Cor. 10 11 
                              All theſe things are written for our admonition. 
                              Rom. 15. 4. 
                              Whatſoever things were written afore-time were written for our learning.
                           
                           They too too ungratefully ſleight this evidence of the divine providence, who ſeeke to conceale from the people theſe Records, as Papiſts do, or they which may, but will not ſearch them, as too many careleſſe Proteſtants.
                           It is Chriſts charge, Ioh. 5. 39. 
                              Search the Scriptures. It was Timothies commendation, that 2 Tim. 3. 15. 
                              from a child he had knowne the holy Scriptures. There are no records more worthy to be ſearched. They are able to make thee wiſe unto ſalvation.
                           
                        
                        
                           §. 63. Of mans miniſtry in writing divine records.
                           II. See §. 61. 
                              GOD uſeth mans ministry in preſerving records for his Church. To omit the particular mention of the ſeverall penmen of ſeverall Scriptures, St. Peter indefinitely ſaith of them all, 2 Pet. 1. 21. 
                              Men ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt. His meaning is, that men wrote the holy Scriptures. Exo 31. 18. One onely record God himſelfe wrote with his owne finger; namely, the Law. Yet therein he uſed Exo. 34. 1. mans miniſtry, both in preparing the tables whereon he wrote it, and in Deut. 10 4, 5. ſhewing them to the people, and preſerving them.
                           Thus would God honour our nature, in making men penmen of that which he indited. And thus would he draw us on to give due heed to mans miniſtry in diſpenſing his Word.
                           To object againſt the Scriptures, that they were written by men, and thereupon the leſſe to eſteeme them, is to croſſe the wiſdome of God, and to pervert that which for our good he hath ordered. The Theſſalonians are commended for receiving the word preached not as the word of men, but as it is indeed, the word of God. So will it be our commendation 1 Theſſ. 2, 13.
                              
to receive the holy Scriptures, not as regiſters and records of men, though they were written by men; but, as they are indeed, the records of God himſelfe.

                           In this reſpect the paines of ſuch as write Chronicles and Hiſtories is commendable: if at leaſt they be conſcionable in recording nothing but truth; and all the truth: and wiſe in Vide plura apud Cic. de Orat. lib. 2. de legibus hiſtoriae conſriben doe.

                              PVblique records are to be ſafe kept. For this end Deut. 10. 5. the tables, in which the ten commandements were written, were put into the arke. And —31. 26. other lawes alſo, yea and the curſes added to the tranſgreſſions thereof were put in the ſide of the arke:

                              The Church for this end is ſtiled the pillar and ground of truth, becauſe it is a faithfull keeper and preſerver of the Oracles of God. So as truth may eaſily be fetcht from it. For, the Apoſtles have laid up in it as in a rich treaſure, all truth moſt fully. So as any that will may fetch from thence drinke of life.
                           The benefit of records is loſt, if they be not ſafely kept. That which is not, cannot be of uſe.
                           We have in this reſpect great cauſe to bleſſe God for the benefit of printing. An act very admirable in it ſelfe; and very advantageous to Church and Common-wealth. Thereby are all ſorts of monuments ſafely kept. Few things put once to print, eſpecially if they be of any ſpeciall account, are utterly loſt. For ſo much may by a few be printed in a day, as hardly can be written by many in a yeare: whereby ſuch ſtore of books of all manner of learning are to be had, as none may ſeeme to be wanting. Yea all ſorts of authors are thereby preſerved. The memory therefore of Iohn Cuthemberg a German, who firſt invented this art in Maguntia, is worthy of all honour.

                              IVdgements on enemies of the Church are to be kept in memory. So many judgements as are recorded in Scripture are ſo many proofs hereof.

By ſuch memorials, ground of courage, and that, generation after generation, is given to Gods Church againſt all that their enemies plot or practice againſt them: and matter of terrour is by them given to enemies. For, they give evidence of that which God hath done for his Church againſt the enemies: and ſo make the Church expect, and their enemies feare the like. For, both the one and the other know that God is ever like himſelfe.
                           Hence as an uſe of this point followeth the next obſervation.
                        
                        
                           §. 67. Of rehearſing to others matters of moment.
                           VI. See §. 61. 
                              MAtters worth record muſt be rehearſed. They muſt be oft ſpoken of an related to others. Exo. 12. 17.—13. 14. Deut. 6. 20. The Law expreſly enjoyns this. This among like means of inſtruction is intended in that Gen. 18. 19. commendation which God giveth of Abraham, of inſtructing his houſhold. For, God revealed the judgement which he intended to bring on Sodom to Abraham, becauſe he knew that he would command his houſhold to feare God, the rather becauſe of the evidence of that judgement. When Iethro, Moſes his father in law, came to ſee him, he related to him Exo. 18. 8. 
                              all that the Lord had done unto Pharaoh, &amp;c.
                           By this means memorable matters, worthy to be knowne farre and neare, in ages preſent and to come, are divulged and propagated, to the greater praiſe of God, whoſe praiſe is thus ſpread abroad, and to the edification of many more then were preſent at the firſt working of thoſe remarkeable things.
                           This eſpecially concernes Miniſters, whoſe office it is to declare, as the counſell of God revealed in his word, ſo alſo the will of God manifeſted in his works: eſpecially, ſuch works as are done in their owne dayes: which, being more freſh, uſe to be the more diligently attended unto, and the more carefully heeded. In this reſpect it will be their wiſdome,

to take due notice themſelves of the memorable works of God, yea, to be inquiſitive after them, and to do what they can to have true and certaine intelligence thereof, that ſo they may rehearſe them to others, and inſtruct their people to make the right uſe thereof.
                           This alſo concernes others that have charge of others, as, Parents, Maſters, Tutors, and other Governours, oft to rehearſe in the eares of thoſe that are under them the remarkable works of the Lord.
                           Yea, becauſe we are all keepers one of another, it behooveth private Chriſtians, as they have occaſion to meet together, to rehearſe in the eares one of another ſuch memorable matters as may according to the ſubject thereof, miniſter matter of humiliation and ſupplication, or of exultation and gratulation. We have a good patterne hereof in Cleophas, and his companion. Luke 24. 14.
                           
                           Commendable in this reſpect is that Act of Parliament which was made in the third yeare of the raigne of King IAMES, for an annuall gratefull remembrance of our more then ordinary deliverance from the Gun. Powder-treaſon. It is anſwerable to that act which was made by Esther and Mordecai, 
                              Eſt. 9. 26. for keeping the dayes called Purim. The annuall celebrating of the fift of November, being enjoyned by Act of Parliament, Miniſters and people make conſcience of obſerving it: and thence many Miniſters take occaſion yeare after yeare to ſet out before their people the unnaturall inhumanity, unſatiable cruelty, and perfidious treachery of Papiſts: and ſo bring people into an utter deteſtation of that more then Heatheniſh Idolatry. Very well did our learned King IAMES, in that ſpeech which he made to both houſes of Parliament upon the diſcovery of that diveliſh powder-treaſon-plot, obſerve, that No other ſect of Heretiques, not excepting Turke, Iew, nor Pagan, no, not even thoſe of Calicute, who adore the Devill, did ever maintaine by the grounds of their religion, that it was lawfull, or rather meritorious (as the Romiſh Catholicks call it) to murther princes
                              
                              or people for quarrell of religion. And although particular men of all profeſſions of religion have beene ſome theeves, ſome murtherers, ſome traitors, yet ever when they came to their end and just puniſhment, they confeſſed their fault to be in their nature, and not in their profeſſion. Theſe Romiſh Catholicks onely excepted. Preſervations therefore, and deliverances from ſuch miſchievous perſons are the beſt preſervations and deliverances: moſt worthy to be remembred thoroughout all generations: that thoroughout all generations due praiſe may be given to God. If See the Discourſe of diſcovering the powder-treaſon, in the works of King IAMES. the horrible miſchiefe intended by that powder-plot, if the neare approach of the time of accompliſhing that plot before it was diſcovered: and if the manner of diſcovering the ſame bee well weighed, wee cannot but diſcerne that there was juſt and great cauſe for preſerving both an annuall, and perpetuall memoriall thereof.
                           Though like publique memorials of all the judgements Private memorials of Gods judgements. which God inflicteth on the enemies of the Church be not made: yet it behooveth particular Chriſtians to take ſpeciall notice of them, ſo farre as they come to their ſight and hearing, and to make ſome private records of them to themſelves: that thereby they may the rather bee provoked both to feare God, and alſo to truſt in him.
                           Private means of keeping in memory Gods judgments, are ſuch as theſe, frequent meditation on them, oft mentioning them in our praiſes to God, much conferring with others about them, declaring them to our poſterity, writing them in private records of our owne, and other ſuch like.
                        
                        
                           
                           §. 68. Of Governours obſervation of Gods former dealings.
                           VII. See §. 61. 
                              GOvernors of Gods Church muſt eſpecially be acquainted with Gods former dealings. When God intended to make Moſes a Governour over his people, he tells him that he is Exo 3. 6. 
                              the God of Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob, thereby putting him in mind what great things he had formerly done for thoſe three Patriarchs and their children. Ioſ. 1. 6. God implied as much in the charge which he gave to Ioſhua, of meditating in the booke of the law, wherein the great works of the Lord as well as lawes were regiſtred. Deut. 17. 18. The like charge on the like ground was given to Kings. But moſt pertinent to this point is —3. 21. 
                              Moſes rehearſing to Ioſhua the conqueſts made of Sihon and Og. 
                              2 Sam. 7. 9. Thus by Gods appointment Nathan putteth David in mind of the former works of God. The like did 2 Chr. 15. 2. 
                              Azariah to Aſa; and 2 King. 19. 25 
                              Iſaiah to Hezekiah.
                           
                           Governours over others being by ſuch meanes well inſtructed in the mind and power of God, and therby brought to feare God, and to truſt in him, have opportunity according to their calling to inſtruct and encourage others: ſo as the benefit which they reape thereby may prove a ſingular benefit to many others.
                           The application of this point, as it concernes Governours themſelves, to uſe all diligence in acquainting themſelves with Gods former works: eſpecially ſuch as concerne his Church, the preſervation of it, and the deſtruction of the enemies of it: ſo it concernes their Chaplens, and ſuch Miniſters as in any particular relation belong unto them, to rehearſe in their eares, and declare unto them the marvellous works that God hath done for ſuch as feare him, and reſt upon him.
                        
                        
                           
                           §. 69. Of Gods avenging.
                           VIII. See §. 61. See alſo The Plaiſter for the Plague, on on Num. 16. 45 § 21. 
                              IT is God that avengeth. The Lord challengeth this as his owne prerogative. Deut. 32. 35. 
                              To me (ſaith he) belongeth vengeance. 
                              Rom. 12 19. 
                              Vengeance is mine. Iuſtly therefore doth the Pſalmiſt give this title to him, Pſal. 94. 1. 
                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                 
                               
                              God of vengeances: and by an 
                                 
                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                 . elegant figure thus doubles it, O Lord God of vengeances, O God of vengeances. So the Prophet Nahum, and that with ſomwhat more emphaſis, Nah. 1. 2. 
                              God is jealous, and the Lord revengeth; the Lord revengeth, and is furious: the Lord will take vengeance of his adverſaries.
                           
                           Gods abſolute ſoveraignty, almighty power, infinite juſtice, incomprehenſible wiſdome, perfect hatred of ſin, indulgent care over his Church, and other like divine properties give proofe hereof. For,
                           1. It is a part of ſupreme or abſolute ſoveraignty to take Gods properties manifeſted in deſtroying enemies. vengeance of ſuch as obſtinately rebell againſt his will; and ſeek to do what miſchiefe they can to his ſervants and Saints.
                           2. By ſo doing he gives evidence of his almighty power, whereby he is able to ſubdue his Churches enemies: and ſhewes how Act. 9. 5. 
                              hard it is to kicke againſt the pricks.
                           
                           3. Iuſt revenge is as true an effect of juſtice, as due reward. Rom. 2. 5, &amp;c. The Apoſtle therefore exemplifieth the righteous judgement of God in both.
                           4. His incomparable wiſdome is manifeſted by ordering the evill plots and practices of wicked men ſo as they tend to the ruine of the contrivers of them. Pſal 9. 15. 
                              They are ſunk down in the pit that they made: in the net that they hid is their foot taken.
                           
                           5. Execution of due vengeance of ſinne is an apparent demonſtration of his hatred of ſinne.
                           6. By that vengeance which the Lord executeth on enemies of the Church, the Churches tranquillity and ſecurity is maintained, and Gods providence over her thereby manifeſted. On theſe premiſes it may well be concluded, that

                              Pſal. 9. 16. Iudgment on enemies miniſters comfort to Saints. 
                              The Lord is knowne by judgement which he executeth.
                           
                           1. Great conſolation hence ariſeth to the Church of God. God is their Lord. What if their enemies be many, mighty, malicious, ſedulous, yet are they under the power of him who is the Protectour of the Church. Their power, their wit, their breath is in his hands, to take away all as he will. On this ground Heb. 13. 6. 
                              Wee may boldly ſay, The Lord is my helper: and I will not feare what man can doe unto mee.
                           
                           2. When we ſee judgement executed on the Churches God to be praiſed for enemies deſtruction. enemies, we are to take notice of the principall agent therein, and to ſay, This is the finger of the Lord: and anſwerably to give him the glory thereof, as Exo 15. 6. 
                              Moſes, 
                              2 Sam. 22. 1, &amp;c. 
                              David, and others.
                           3. The terrour of the Churches enemies muſt needs be Gods executing vengeance terrour to wicked. much aggravated by this, that God takes upon himſelfe to execute vengeance. For, this Lord is an almighty, ever-living, juſt, and jealous God. His ſtroaks are heavy. There is no avoiding them, no enduring them. His vengeance is endleſſe, and eaſeleſſe, mercileſſe, and remedileſle. It is a fearefull thing to fall into the hands of the living God, Hebr.

                              Anſw. This was not done at once: but, at ſeverall times, by degrees. If Saul had faithfully executed 1 Sam. 15. 3. 
                              the charge of God, by him had this denunciation beene executed. But, yet then it was —14. 48.—15. 7, 8. in part performed: —30. 17. afterwards more fully by David. For, after Davids time we read little of any of them.

                                 3. To give demonſtration of his patience in ſparing ſuch as ſtand: for, he that rooteth out ſome nations, can as eaſily root out others, one after another, as he did the ſeven nations before Iſrael.

Aſſuredly as ſin is multiplied &amp; aggravated, ſo ſhall judgement alſo; eſpecially when multitudes run on headlong to ſin. And if lighter judgements prevaile not, God will not ceaſe till he have utterly ruinated them. This of old was threatned; this in former ages hath Lev. 26. 18, 32. been executed. Now God ſtil remaineth to be the ſame God, as juſt, as jealous, as powerfull as ever he was. With the froward he will ſhew himſelfe froward. To them that are unſatiable Pſal. 18. 26. in ſin, God will be implacable in wrath.

                              THere is no place of ſafety from Gods revenge. 
                              Ier. 16. 16. 
                              Behold (ſaith he) I will ſend for many fiſhers, and they ſhall fiſh them, and after I will ſend for many hunters, and they ſhall hunt them from every mountaine and from every hill. After that the King of Babel had deſtroyed the greater part of the Iewes in their owne country, and caried many of them captive into Babylon, a remnant of them continuing obſtinately in their wicked courſes, thought notwithſtanding Ier. 44. 12. that in Egypt they might be ſafe; but even there alſo the hand of the Lord was ſtretched out againſt them, and deſtroyed them.

                              Whither then ſhall any go from his Spirit, or whither ſhall he flee from his preſence?  &amp;c.
                           The onely ſafe courſe, when Gods wrath is provoked, and the fire of his indignation flameth forth, is, not to fly from him, but to fall downe before him; as David did when he ſaw the Angell that ſmote the people with peſtilence. God uſeth to ſpare ſuch as at the apprehenſion of his diſpleaſure 2 Sam. 24. 17. humble themſelves in his preſence, when from every place under heaven he deſtroyeth ſuch as impenitently perſiſt in ſinne.

                              EXOD. XVII. XV.
                              And Moſes built an altar, and called the name of it IEHOVAH-NISSI.
                           
                           
                              See §. 1. IN this verſe the Memoriall which Moſes made of the fore-mentioned victory, is recorded. In memory thereof he is ſaid to build an altar.
                           
                           The proper uſe of altars was to offer ſacrifices on them. The

                               notation of the originall word importeth as much. The frequent Lev. 9. 7. charge to offer upon the altar: and the anſwerable Gen. 8. 20. practice of Saints in offering ſacrifices on altars do further prove as much. Yet alſo were they made for monuments, as is evident by Ioſ. 22. 26, 27. the apology which the Reubenites, Gadites, and halfe tribe of Manaſſeh made for the Altar which they built; whereby they deny that it was for ſacrifice, and affirme that it was onely for witneſſe. Both theſe ends and uſes were here queſtionleſſe intented by Moſes. This word,

                              he built, ſheweth that it was now newly made, and that upon occaſion of the victory. The particular name given to it, importeth a memoriall. The kind of name implieth a gratulation, 
                              Ioſ. 8. 31. which of old was teſtified by erecting altars, and offering ſacrifices thereon.
                           This was thus done at this time becauſe the Tabernacle was not yet erected, nor the Prieſt-hood ſetled on Aaron and his poſterity.
                           The particular name here ſpecified word for word is this,

                               The root or primary word from whence the word tranſlated banner commeth, ſignifieth to lift up a banner, or enſigne, or to hold up a ſtandard. Now banners uſe to be erected in armies, that by the ſight of them ſouldiers might know whether to come, or to go, or where to ſtand. In

alluſion whereunto the preaching of the Goſpell to the Gentiles whereby they were called into the Church, and there directed what to do, is reſembled to the Iſa. 11. 10.—13. 2.—18. 3. 
                              lifting up of a banner, or enſigne.
                           
                           
                              Ier. 4. 21.—51. 12. Banners uſe alſo to be ſet up on the walls or towers of cities that are taken by conqueſt, to ſhew that they are in the conquerors power.
                           Here this title banner hath relation to Moſes his holding up his rod on the top of the hill, and that as a banner or ſtanderd, as was before noted in the end of §. 25. And by this title ſheweth that it was the Lord who cauſed the banner to be held up in the field, and to remaine ſteddy after the enemy was diſcomfited: that is, who afforded ſuccour in the battel, and gave ſuch ſucceſſe, as like victorers they continued to hold up their banners. The LXX Greeke Tranſlators of the Bible in that reſpect well expreſſe the meaning of the word, thus, The Lord my refuge: and St. Hierom thus,

                              The Lord my rejoycing, or my lifting up.
                           
                           In this title Moſes uſeth the firſt perſon and ſingular number, thus,

                              my banner, partly in relation to this fore-named particular act of holding up the rod (teſtifying hereby that it was not any vertue in the rod held up, or in his act of holding it up, whereby the victory was obtained: but meerely the ſuccour and ſucceſſe which the Lord gave) and partly in oppoſition to ſuch as are out of the Church, and enemies thereto: ſo as, the Iſrael of God, the Church of God are compriſed under this particle, MY: and thus the Church is under this firſt perſon brought in, ſaying, The Lord MY banner, not the banner of aliens and enemies.

                              Iehovah is joyned with Adonai, that Adonai might not be twice together pronounced, it is pointed with the pricks of Elohim, thus, Iehovih, and anſwerably they read it Elohim, which word ſignifieth the mighty God. To confirme this courſe of pronouncing Iehovah with other words, they alledge that the blaſphemy for which the Moungrill of an Egyptian Father, and Iſraelitiſh mother was ſtoned to death, was an open pronouncing of that ineffable name Iehovah, in the proper letters and vowels thereof. This they gather out of this phraſe, Lev. 24. 11.

relation to Iehovah. And this reaſon is rendred of the Iewes forbearing to pronounce Iehovah, that they might take away all occasion from the Heathen of imagining their god to be Iehovah. Howſoever, there was a ſavour of too much ſuperſtition in forbearing the ſound, and letters of theſe high and excellent names Iehovah, and Iah: and their reaſons produced beare not full weight at the ballance of the Sanctuary, the holy Scriptures: yet ſhall they be a witneſſe and evidence againſt many Chriſtians, who over lightly eſteeme, Deut. 28. 58.

                           Not the Iewes onely, but alſo the LXX Greeke Tranſlators of the Old Teſtament, were very tender in uſing this name Iehovah. They do not therefore tranſlate according to the ſound, and ſillables, and letters of the Hebrew word: but according to the ſenſe and meaning thereof: and ſo turne this Hebrew word Iehovah, by a word that ſignifieth

                              Pen-men of the New Teſtament, Apoſtles and Evangelists imitated them.
                           In imitation hereof, those learned and judicious Divines, who by King IAMES his ſpeciall command were appointed to tranſlate anew the holy Scriptures into the Engliſh Tongue, very rarely uſe this word Iehovah in Engliſh: but turne it thus, The Lord. Yet, that the reader might know when this word Lord is put for Iehovah, they cauſed it to be printed in foure capitall letters, thus, LORD. So as, whenſoever ye find LORD ſo printed, know Iehovah is there expreſſed in the originall, or at leaſt Iah, which we have ſhewed to be an abbreviation of Iehovah.

For evidence thereof, either and both of theſe two laſt recited names, being applied to God, though they be of the plurall number, uſe to be joyned with words of the ſingular number. Witneſſe the firſt clauſe of the Bible,

The word of the plurall number ſets out the Trinity of Perſons. The word of the ſingular number joyned with it, ſets out the Vnity of the Deity in the Trinity of Perſons.

The ninth is

                           The tenth is 
                                 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                           Of all theſe, Iehovah is the moſt proper name of God: 
                                 Iehovah Gods moſt proper name. and ſetteth out moſt excellencies in God. It is never in Scripture attributed to any but to God. Some of the other names of God are ſometimes attributed to Angels, ſometimes to men, as, Gen. 19. 2.—24. 9. 
                              Adonai, and Pſal. 82. 1.—85.

                              Heretique hath lately publiſhed the contrary: and giveth theſe inſtances following of the title Iehovah attributed to creatures.
                           1. This text which we have in hand, (Exo. 17. 15.) where ſaith he, the altar is ſtiled Iehovah.
                           
                           
                              Anſw. Iehovah ſimply in it ſelfe is not attributed to this Altar. But a compound word, Iehovah-Niſſi, Iehovah my banner. He might to like purpoſe have alleadged the title which Abraham gave to the place where he was about to ſacrifice Iſaac, which is this, Iehovah-jireh, Iehovah will 
                              
                                 
                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                  d Gen. 22 14. 
                              provide. And that title which Gideon gave to the Altar which he made to God, and called Iehovah ſhalem, Iehovah

                              peace, that is, Iehovah is a God of peace: or, Iehovah will give, or, hath given peace. But, all theſe, and other like to theſe, are to no purpoſe for the point in queſtion, there being a great difference betwixt a ſimple and compound name. Beſides, theſe titles had not ſo much reſpect to the altars and place whereunto they were attributed, as to Iehovah himſelfe: as the very phraſes do imply. They were only memorials of Iehovahs protection, and providence, and

                              peace. Who can imagine otherwiſe, but that theſe phraſes, Iehovah is my banner, Iehovah will provide, Iehovah is peace, have reſpect to Iehovah himſelfe.
                           2. A ſecond inſtance which he giveth of a creature to which the name Iehovah is attributed, is the Arke of the Covenant. For proofe whereof he alledgeth Pſal. 24. 7, 8. &amp; 47. 5.
                           
                              Anſw. In neither of thoſe places quoted, no nor in either of the Pſalms mentioned, is any mention or iutimation of the Arke. Both the Pſalmes are typicall, and propheſie of Chriſt, and his joyfull comming. So as the title Iehovah in both thoſe places is attributed to Ieſus Christ, true God, true Iehovah.
                           
                           3. The third and laſt inſtance, is of Angels, who, he ſaith, are ſtiled Iehovah. And thereof giveth theſe proofes, Gen. 16. 13. &amp; 18, 13, 20, 22. &amp; 19. 17. &amp; Exo. 3. 4. &amp; Iudg. 13. 22, 23.
                           
                              Anſ. For, Gen. 19. 17. Iehovah is not there mentioned at all. For the other places, if they be well marked, it wilbe found that they all ſpeake of the Angell of the Covenant, Chriſt Ieſus.
                           
                           Thus then it remaineth true that Iehovah is a title proper to God alone, Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost. This one word cōſiſting of three ſillables eſpecialy ſuch three ſillables as they The excellencies of this title Iehovah. are, ſet out the unity of the Deity in the Trinity of Perſons.

                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                  Exo. 3. 14. 
                              I am that I am, and againe, I am (which phraſes do apparently imply his being of himſelfe: from whom all others receive their being, and are preſerved) theſe are interpretations of Iehovah. And thereupon having thus expreſly ſet out the meaning thereof, he addeth in the Exo. 3. 15. next verſe, Iehovah the God of your Fathers hath ſent, &amp;c. As if more diſtinctly he had ſaid, whereas I thus ſtiled my ſelfe, I am that I am: and, I am: know that it is I Iehovah, that, Am that I am. And this, I am that I am, and, I am, ſets out the meaning of my name Iehovah.
                           
                           3. Iehovah declares the immutability of God. For, it containes all times; Now, to have beene, without limitation of any beginning, to be, namely the ſame in all times, to be to come, without any intimation of any end, muſt needs imply an immutability. This interpretation of the name Iehovah (I am that I am) gives further demonſtration of this property (Immutability) to be compriſed under it. Therefore God himſelf thus ſaith in regard of this his name, I am Iehovah, I change not. 
                              Mal. 3. 6.
                           
                           4. Iehovah implies his Fidelity. For, where there is

immutability of eſſence, there muſt needs be ſtability in word. God himſelfe declares that thus much is intended by this name. For, where he ſaith, Exo. 6. 3. Vide Trem. &amp; Iunij an not. in hunc. loc.
                              By my name Iehovah was I not knowne to them, he meaneth, that though he made many promiſes to them, eſpecially concerning their poſſeſſion of Canaan, yet did he not ſhew himſelfe to be Iehovah, an accompliſher of his promiſes. That he reſerved to future Generations. And even then when he ſpake this, he began to bring them out of bondage into Canaan, therefore he ſaith, when he ſent Moſes to them, Iehovah the God of your fathers hath ſent, &amp;c. that is, that God which made ſuch and ſuch promiſes, will now ſhew himſelfe Iehovah, an accompliſher of his promiſes: therefore he hath ſent to bring you out of Egypt. This is evident by this which God himſelfe ſaith, Exo. 66. 
                              I am Iehovah, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. They have little skill in the Hebrew text, who imagine that the name Iehovah was not knowne before God here ſpake to Moſes. 
                              Gen. 24. Immediately after the firſt Sabbath in Paradiſe, when God had finiſhed all his workes, frequent mention is made of Iehovah, and that in Abrahams, Iſaacs, and Iacobs dayes. So as in the place where God ſaith, By my name Iehovah was I not knowne to them, not the name it ſelfe, but the forementioned ſenſe and meaning thereof muſt needs bee meant.
                           Other divine excellencies might be produced out of this name Iehovah, but theſe are ſufficient to ſhew the equity of that which the Law thus expreſſely requireth, Thou ſhalt feare this glorious and fearefull name IEHOVAH

                           THe Summe of this Verſe is, A thankefull memoriall of a memorable victory.
                           
                           More particularly we may note,
                                 1. The Perſon that makes the Memoriall, Moſes.
                                 
                                 2. The Kinde of Memoriall.
                              
                           
                           This latter is expreſſed
                                 1. By a monument made, He built an altar.
                                 
                                 2. By a name given to it, And called the name of it Iehovah-Niſſi.
                                 
                              
                           
                           1. The Perſon (Moſes, of whom before) was the Prince Moſes and chiefe Governour of the people at that time, whence I collect, that,
                                 
                                    Chiefe Governours ought to take chiefe care for publique acts of piety.
                                 
                              2. The Altar here built was for an euchariſticall or gratulatory ſacrifice, which was a publique teſtimony of publique built an altar and ſolemne thanks. Whence I obſerve, that,
                                 
                                    Publique praiſe is to be given to God for publique deliverances.
                                 
                              3. The giving a name to this Altar, ſhewes that he would and called the name of it have it remaine as a memoriall. Whence I inferre, that,
                                 
                                    Memorials of Gods mercies are to be made.
                                 
                              4. The particular name (Iehovah-Niſſi) hath reference to Moſes holding up his hands, with the Rod of God therein, Iehovah-Niſſi. as a banner. Whereby he ſheweth his acknowledgement of the Lord to be the giver of that victory. Whence I may conclude, that,
                                 
                                    The glory of deliverances is to be aſcribed to God.

                              CHiefe Governours are to take chiefe care for publique acts of piety.

It was alſo a charge which God expreſly gave to Iacob: whereof he tooke eſpeciall care. Where we read of altars built to worſhip God, we ſhall find them erected by chiefe Governours: ſuch as —8. 20.

                              Iacob, and others, who in their life time were of higheſt authority in the Church of God. So other acts of piety were ordered by them under God. Exo. 3 5. 1, &amp;c 
                              Moſes ordered all the duties of piety in the wilderneſſe. David in time of 2 Sam: 5. 19. warre and —21. 1. famine ſought the Lord: and —24. 25. in time of plague built an altar to pacifie Gods wrath. Yea he —6. 17. brought the Arke to areſting place: 1 Chro. 23. &amp; 24. &amp; 25. &amp; 26. appointed the orders and offices of Priests and Levites, and 1 Chro. 28. 11. made the patterne of the Temple. Salomon his ſonne 2 Chro. 3. 1. built the Temple, 
                              —4. 1, &amp;c. made all the holy veſſels appertaining therto, and —6. 1, &amp;c. 
                              dedicated the ſame. Aſa

Thus Chriſtian Emperours, Neh. 8. 9, 16. Kings, and other ſupreme Governours in their dominions, have accounted it a duty belonging unto them to take care of the Church of Chriſt, and to appoint orders for matters of religion and piety. Conſtantine the Great, who was the firſt Chriſtian Emperour, being eſtabliſhed in his royall government, Euſeb. de vitâ Conſtant. l 2. made lawes for the peace of Chriſtians, and a free profeſſion of their religion, and worſhipping of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Ibid. He rooted out idolatry every where: and Ibid. l 3. oppoſed himſelfe againſt the errours and hereſies that had crept into the Church. Ibid. l. 3. He convocated the

firſt generall Councill at Nice, and ſate Preſident therein. Ibid. He built and adorned many Churches. Ibid. He wrote ſundry letters to Biſhops time after time, for well ordering matters of piety and Church-affaires. Ibid l. 4, He promoted ſundry Biſhops to their places. Ibid. He was carefull to ſee the Lords Day ſanctified. Ibid. He cauſed piety to be obſerved, and God to be worſhipped in his armies. He procured the holy Scripture to be diſperſed every where. In fine, he maketh this profeſſion of himſelfe. 
                                 Hunc mihi prae omnibus finem praepoſitum eſſe debere judicavi, ut in ſanctiſſima Eccleſiae Caetholi cae multitudine, una fides, ſincera charitas, &amp; conſentiens erga Deum omnipotentem religionis cultus conſervetur. Euſeb de vit. Conſtant. l 3. 
                              I acknowledge that this end, above all others, is to be ſet before me, that in the holy company of the Catholique Church, one faith, ſincere charity, and an uniform worſhip towards almighty God, be preſerved. Much alſo might be declared of Theodoſius, and other ancient Chriſtian Emperours care about matters of piety. The made many edicts and lawes thereabouts. 
                                 Solicitudo clementiae tuae in Catholic â Eccleſiâ nihil impacatum, nibil vult eſſe diverſum. Leo Papa ad Theodoſ. Epiſt. 12. An ancient Biſhop of Rome thus writes to Theodoſius: The care of your Clemency will ſuffer nothing in the Catholique Church to be tumultuous nothing factious. Yea 
                                 Pro integritate fidei Catholicae Chriſtianiſſimum Principem oportet eſſe ſollicitum. Idem. Epiſt, 10 the ſame Biſhop ſaith, that, It behoveth a Christian Prince to be carefull for the integrity of the Catholique faith. I would the latter Popes of Rome had beene, and ſtill were of that opinion. If they were, they would not uſurpe ſuch authority as they have done, and ſtill do over Chriſtian Princes, to the diſturbance of their States. But to come to our owne time and country. King Henry 8. put downe the Popes Authority, and began a reformation of Religion. Edward 6. perfected that reformation. Queene Elizabeth reſtored it. King Iames and King Charles continued it. Thus by the divine providence this title Defender of the Faith, is moſt juſtly put into our Kings ſtile.
                           To this end, namely to defend the faith, maintaine religion, and advance piety, hath God given them that ſupreme authority which they have, to be in all cauſes temporall and eccleſiaſticall over all perſons, in their dominions under Chriſt ſupreme Governours. 2 Chro. 9. 8. He hath ſet them on his throne, and given them his owne title. For, he ſaith of them, Pſal. 82. 6. 
                              Ye are Gods, children of the moſt high. And to ſhew that their authority is not onely for State-policy, but alſo for

Church-piety, they are ſtiled Iſa. 49. 23. 
                              Nurſing Fathers of the Church; and they are made keepers of both tables. Thus both their power and their place require of chiefe Governours an eſpeciall care of publique piety: whereby they ſhall give evidence of their owne pious intention and affection: and alſo draw on others under their government to be like minded.
                           
                              See § 40. See alſo Dearths Death on 2 Sam. 21. 1. §. 15. As this putteth Magiſtrates themſelves in mind of their duty, ſo it teacheth ſubjects to pray for them, that they may do what by vertue of their place they are bound to do, and by their obedience to ſuch pious orders as their pious Governours preſcribe, to encourage them in their pious care.

                           II. See §. 71. 
                              PVblique praiſe is to be given to God for publique deliverances. Such was the praiſe that for the publique a Exo. 15. 1, 20 21. deliverance from Pharaohs tyranny, was given by Moſes. For, it is ſaid, that Moſes, and the children of Iſrael, and Miriam, and all the women, ſang praiſe unto the Lord. The women came out with timbrels and dances, and anſwered the men: ſo as it was moſt publique. Iudg. 5. 1, &amp;c. Such was Deborahs and Baraks kind of praiſing God: and 2 Chro. 20 26 
                              Iehoſaphats after his deliverance from the Moabites, Ammonites, and Inhabitants of Mount Seir. Such are many of Davids Pſalmes. The phraſes of praiſing God Pſal. 22. 22.

                              in the great congregation, among much people: 
                              —116. 18, 19. 
                              in the preſence of all Gods people: in the courts of the Lords houſe; in the middest of Ieruſalem.
                           
                           By this kind of praiſe God himſelfe is more glorified, our owne hearts are more quickned, and others are incited to imitate us.
                           They who content themſelves for publique bleſſings with an inward ejaculation of the heart, or with ſecret praiſe in a ſecret place betwixt God and themſelves, or with

private praiſe in a family, or among ſome private friends, though what they do in this manner they do well, yet come ſhort of that which they ought to do.
                           O let our hearts be filled with ſuch zeale towards God, as to take the occaſions which by the divine providence are offered us of ſetting out Gods praiſes in the moſt ſolemne, and publique manner that we can. Thus ſhall we ſhew that we can diſtinguiſh betwixt Gods bleſſings, and in ſome meaſure carie our ſelves anſwerably to him: that, as he bleſſeth us not only with private but alſo with publique bleſſings, ſo we will praiſe him, not only privately, but alſo publikely.

                              MEmorials of Gods mercies are to be made. Beſides the names §. 65. before noted for memorials of Gods judgments (which import alſo his mercies towards his people as well as judgements on their enemies) there are many others which directly point at his mercies. As many Gen. 4. 25.—5. 9.—17. 19. names given to children, which the Lord, as an eſpeciall bleſſing gave to his Saints: and —17. 5, 15.—32. 28. other names, which as memorials of ſpeciall favours God gave to men and women: and —16. 14.—32. 2. 2 Chro. 20. 26. names alſo of places, which were given as ſignes and evidences of more then ordinary benefits conferred on Gods people: and other viſible monuments of memorable mercies, as, Exo. 16 32, 33

                           By ſuch memorials the memory of Gods mercies is kept freſh: thereby men are the more, and oftner provoked to praiſe God for them. Yea, thus Gods mercies manifeſted

in one age are propagated to many ages: whereby many ages have matter of praiſing God miniſtred unto them: yea and of believing in God, and of hoping for like mercies from him. For, God is the Lord that changeth not. Theſe Mal. 3. 6. memorials therefore giving evidence of what God hath beene able and willing to do, they give cauſe to hope for like mercies on like occaſions. So as ſuch memorials are honourable to God, and profitable to preſent and future ages.
                           Take notice herof O ye Saints, to whom the Lord vouchſafeth ſuch mercies as are worthy to be had in everlaſting remembrance: let them not ſlip out of your minds. Where publique memorials of them are wanting let private Chriſtians make the beſt private memorials of them that they can.

Many other ſuch titles are noted in Scripture, wherein the name of God is expreſſed, to ſhew that they aſcribed their deliverances to God. But more expreſly is this proved by thoſe hymnes which after deliverances were penned, wherein God is acknowledged to have given deliverance, as thoſe which Exo. 15. 1.

                              Sing unto the Lord all the earth; ſhew forth from day to day his ſalvation. Give unto the Lord, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the Lord glory and ſtrength. And againe, Pſal. 68. 34. Exitus bellorum ex Dei pendere judicio docet Aug. de Civ. Dei. lib. 5. cap. 22. 
                              Aſcribe ye ſtrength unto the Lord: that is, acknowledge that that ſtrength which you have to withſtand and overcome your enemies is given you of God, and give him the glory of it.
                           Whatſoever the meanes be that are uſed by men, it is God that giveth deliverances, Pſal. 18. 50. He weakneth the power of enemies, he infatuateth their counſels, he diſappointeth their plots; He gives wiſdome, ſtrength, courage, and ſucceſſe to his people. It is therefore moſt juſt and equall, and that which is but due, that the glory of that which God giveth be given to him.

                              For he ſaid, Becauſe the Lord hath ſworne that the Lord will have warre with Amalek from generation to generation.
                           
                           THis verſe may be taken as a reaſon of that which went before, as the cauſall particle, FOR, prefixed before it by our Engliſh and ſundry other Tranſlators, ſheweth. The reaſon is taken from Gods implacable wrath againſt Amalek. Becauſe God was inalterably reſolved utterly to deſtroy Amalek, therefore was there a memoriall of this firſt beginning to ſubdue them: that by this memoriall ſucceeding ages might be encouraged to war againſt Amalek, as occaſion ſhould be offered, in aſſurance of victory. The Hebrew hath an ordinary copulative particle

                           The phraſe whereby Gods reſolution is expreſſed, word for word is this, The hand upon the throne of the Lord. Or,

                              The Lords hand upon the throne. This is a forme, or a rite of ſwearing. As among us, for ordinary perſons to lay their hand upon a booke: for noble men, to lay their hand upon their breaſt; for a King, to lay his hand upon his Throne. Sometimes the lifting up of the hand implieth an oath, as where Abraham ſaith, I have lift up my hand to the Lord.

Among other anathemaes annexed to the Nicene Creed, this is one; If any doth not take this, THE LORD rained FROM THE LORD, of the Father and the Sonne, but ſaith that the ſame rained from himſelfe, let him be anathema.

The warre here mentioned was an effect of an irreconciliable enmity, and a meanes of that which was before mentioned, an utter putting out of the

                           It behooveth us on this ground well to obſerve what parts of Gods irreverſible counſell are now under the Goſpell revealed: and to keepe them well in memory. To inſtance this in ſome particulars, theſe following are as inviolably ſet downe, as this of Amalek.
                           
                           1. 2 Theſſ. 2. 8. The deſtruction of that great adverſary of the Chriſtian Church, Antichriſt, whom the Lord ſhall conſume. And Rev. 17. 26, 27 there are certaine Kings into whoſe heart God hath put to fulfill his will, which is, to hate the whore, to make her deſolate and naked, and to eat her fleſh, and to burne her with fire.
                           
                           2. The calling of the Iewes. For, beſide the many propheſies of thoſe ancient Prophets that were before Chriſt, Rom. 11. 25. 26 Saint Paul expreſly revealeth the determined counſell of God concerning this point, whereof he would not have Chriſtians to be ignorant.
                           3. A bringing in of Rom. 11. 25. A fulneſſe of the Gentiles: at which

time the many differences which are now betwixt Chriſtian Churches, ſhalbe taken away: and a farre better union betwixt nations even in matters of religion eſtabliſhed.
                           Among other meanes of remembring theſe, whereof §. 66. before, we ought oft to call upon God for the accompliſhment of them, and that becauſe they are abſolutely promiſed.
                        
                        
                           §. 80. Of Gods ſwearing vengeance.
                           II. See §. 76. 
                              MAns wickedneſſe forceth God to ſweare vengeance. Hereunto Pſal. 95. 11. Num. 14. 21, &amp;c the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe provoked God: and 1 Sam. 3. 14. the houſe of Elie: and Ier. 22. 24.

                              Zedekiah: and Am. 6. 8. the ten Tribes that revolted from the houſe of David: and Ezek. 5. 11. the children of Iudah while they lived in their land, and Ier. 44. 26. after they were gone into Egypt: and —46.18. the Egyptians: and Zeph. 2. 9. the Moabites and Ammonites: and Iſa. 14. 24. the Aſſyrians and Babylonians: and ſundry

                           What may be the reaſon that the Lord ſhould ſweare? Is it not enough for him to threaten? Surely in regard of himſelfe, and his owne divine properties it is enough. God doth not ſweare, becauſe he needs credit. Every word of God is true and faithfull: and it is as an oth. For, God is not faithfull by reaſon of his oth, but by reaſon of God, his oth is true and ſtable. For, he is able to make good every word that cometh out of his mouth; al in heaven and earth cannot hinder the execution therof: and in this kind when by his word his truth is engaged, he wil without failing do what he is able to do. The reaſon therefore of Gods oath reſteth on man, who is prone to make ſleight account of Gods word, who hath a ſtiffe necke, an hard heart, an obſtinate ſpirit. Wherefore to terrifie him the more, the Lord by oath bindeth himſelf to take vengeance. As on the contrary, Because we are wont to believe more ſtedfaſtly that which is confirmed by an oath, that our faith ſhould not waver, God is ſaid to ſweare. So as the Lord in tender reſpect to the weakneſſe of his children, who

by reaſon of the fleſh in them, are prone to make queſtion of Gods promiſes, doth bind them with his oath, (as he did to Iſa 54. 9. 
                              Noah, to Gen. 22 16. 
                              Abraham, to the Exo 13. 5. other Patriarchs, to Pſal 89. 3. 
                              David, and to other Saints) ſo by reaſon of the wickeds incredulous diſpoſition, God binds his threatnings with his oath.
                           1. This gives evidence of the corruption of nature, which Mans ſlownes to beleeve. is ſo poſſeſſed with infidelity, as more then ordinary means muſt be uſed to worke our hearts to give credit to that which ought upon the leaſt intimation to be with all reverence 
                                 Sihominibus affirmantibus ſe vera dicere, etiamſi non addant ſermoni juramentum, credere ſolemus, quis adeò furioſus eſſe poteſt, ut non credat Conditori omnium rerum, praeſertim iuramento interpoſito. Theodor Dialog. 1. believed. God is the Lord God of truth, (Pſal. 31. 5.) He can not lie, (Tit. 1. 2.) It is impoſſible that he ſhould, Heb. 6. 18 His bare word is more then all other arguments or inducements whatſoever can be uſed to worke faith. Yet is it by corrupt man little regarded. If we uſe to believe men, when they avouch that they tell truth, who can be ſo mad, as not to believe the Maker of all things? eſpecially when he interpoſeth his oath? O the infidelity of mans heart to God ward! Muſt God be put to his oath, and forced to ſweare? What matter of humiliation doth this miniſter unto us?
                           2. Much terrour muſt this needs miniſter to ſuch as Gods oath for vengeance, terrour. provoke God thus to ratifie vengeance againſt them. There can bee no hope for ſuch to eſcape. For, by an oath he that ſweares binds himſelfe to that which 
                                 Quibus juravi in jrâ meâ. Magnus terror. Aug. Enar. in Pſal. 94. he ſweares to doe. The bonds of an oath are ſuch as theſe.
                           1. A calling of one to witneſſe for that which is ſpoken. Inſtance this forme of oath uſed by the Apoſtle, 2 Cor. 1. 23. 
                              I call God 
                              Bonds of an oath. 
                              for a record upon my ſoule.
                           
                           2. An appointing of one to be a Iudge of what is ſaid, which this phraſe, Gal. 1. 20. 
                              before God I lie not, importeth.
                           3. A making of one to be an avenger, if that which is ſworne be not ſo. So did ſhe that thus ſwore, Ruth. 1. 17. 
                              The Lord do ſo to me, and more alſo, if ought but death part thee and me.
                           
                           4. A pawning of ſomthing for the truth of that which

is ſworne. Hee pawned the life of his Soveraigne, who thus ſwore, Gen. 42. 15. 
                              By the life of Pharaoh ye ſhall not goe hence, &amp;c.
                           5. An imprecating of ſome evill to ones ſelfe, if it be not as he ſweares: as Num. 5. 20. that forme of oath which by the law is preſcribed to a woman ſuſpected of uncleaneneſſe.
                           By all theſe bonds doth God in his oath binde himſelfe. For, z 
                              Having no greater to ſweare by, makes himſelfe witneſſe, judge, and avenger of what he ſweareth. Heb. 6. 13. 
                              He ſwore by himſelfe. The things alſo which he pawnes are moſt precious to him, as, his Ier. 51. 14. 
                              Soule, his —44. 26. 
                              Name, his Am 8. 7. 
                              Excellency, his Pſal. 8. 35. 
                              Holineſſe, his Iſa. 62. 8. 
                              Right Hand, and Strong Arme, and here his Exo 17. 16. 
                              Throne. Yea, he doth alſo by way of Pſal 95. 11. 
                              Imprecation bind himſelfe, but ſo as the thing imprecated is never expreſt.
                           By the way note, that in all the formes of Gods oath he hath relation onely to himſelfe: whereby is evicted that 
                                 Iurat per ſemetipſum, ut vel juranti Deo, credas alium Deum omnino non eſſe Tertul adverſ. Marcion. lib. 2. there is none above him, none equall to him: no God but he.
                           Can any now imagine that that whereunto God ſo binds himſelf ſhall not be performed? Or that any can free themſelves from his wrath, when he is provoked to ſweare vengeance. O ye that thus far provoke the great Lord of heaven and earth, tremble and quake at his oath. Shall ſuch a Lyon roare, and the beaſts not tremble? The Kings wrath 
                              
                                 Loqui Dominum magnum eſt. Quanto magis jurare Deum? Iurantem hominem debes timere, ne propter ju rationem faciat quod contra voluntatem ejus eſt, quanto magis Deum qui nihil temerè iurare po left? Aug. Enar. in Pſal. 94. (even a mortall Kings) is as the roaring of a Lyon, Pro. 19. 12. as meſſengers of death, Prov. 16. 14. Who ſo provoketh him to anger ſinneth against his owne ſoule, Pro. 20. 2. What is it then to provoke the wrath of the King of Kings? Yea, ſo to provoke it, as to force him to ſweare in wrath that he wilbe avenged on them? It is a great matter for the Lord to threaten vengeance: how much more to ſweare it? We have cauſe to feare when a man ſweareth, leaſt by reaſon of his oath he do what he would not. How much more ought we to feare when God ſweareth, who ſweareth nothing raſhly?
                           
                              
3. It wilbe our wiſdome to take notice of ſuch particular ſinnes as God doth bind himſelfe to revenge, that we may the more carefully avoid them. They are ſuch as follow.
                                 1. Infidelity, eſpecially when God hath plainely revealed his purpoſe, and made many promiſes, and by his oath confirmed the ſame, Deut. 1. 34.
                                 2. Diſtruſtfulneſſe, and doubting of good ſucceſſe in that which God giveth in expreſſe charge, Deut. 4. 21.
                                 3. Idolatry, whereby the true God is forſaken by thoſe to whom he hath made knowne himſelfe: and falſe gods ſet in his roome, Ier. 44. 26.
                                 4. Profanation of holy things: which manifeſteth a diſreſpect of God himſelfe, Ezek. 5. 11.
                                 5. Toleration of ſuch as are impious againſt God: whereby men are honoured above God, 1 Sam. 3. 14. &amp; 2. 29.
                                 6. Contempt of Gods word. For, what is that but a contempt of God himſelfe? Ier. 22. 23, 24.
                                 7. Perjury: which is a kind of daring God to take vengeance, Ezek. 17. 16.
                                 8. Light esteeme of Gods favours: and continuall murmuring at his providence, Pſal. 95. 11.
                                 9. Indolency, and want of compaſſion at the miſeries of Gods people, Am. 6. 8.
                                 10. Inſultations over the Church of Chriſt in her calamities, and when enemies prevaile againſt her, Zeph. 2. 9.
                                 11. Oppreſſion of the poore, Am. 4. 1, 2. &amp; 8. 7.
                                 12. Vnſatiable cruelty againſt ſuch as fall into their clutches, Iſa. 14. 24.
                              
                           
                        
                        
                           
                           §. 81. Of Gods undertaking his Churches quarrels.
                           III. See §. 76. 
                              GOD undertakes his Churches quarrels. What elſe doth that import which Ioſ, 5 13, 14. 
                              Iehovah appearing to Ioſhua in the ſhape of a man with a ſword drawne in his hand, ſaid, As a captaine of the hoſt of the Lord am I now come? In this reſpect is the Lord ſtilled Exo. 15. 3. 
                              a man of warre: and the warres of Gods Church are ſtiled 1 Sam. 18. 17. 
                              warres of God. As one evidence herof, God hath oft viſibly ſhewed himſelfe by extraordinary meanes to fight for his: as Exo. 14 24, &amp;c. in the Red Sea againſt Pharaoh: 
                              Ioſ 6. 20. by cauſing the walls of Iericho to fall downe without warlike inſtrument: —10. 11. 
                              by caſting downe great ſtones from heaven upon enemies: Iudg 3. 31. by enabling a man to kill 600 with an oxe goade: 
                              —7. 8. 12. by giving victory to 300 againſt an army that for multitude were as the ſand of the ſea: 
                              —15. 8. by the extraordinary ſtrength which he gave to Sampſon: 
                              1 Sam. 7. 10. by ſcattering enemies with a great thunder: 
                              —14. 13, &amp;c. by putting an army to flight at the ſight of two men: 2 Sam. 5. 24. 1 Sam. 14, 15. 2 King. 7. 6. by affrighting enemies when none appeare againſt them: Iudg. 7. 22. 2 Chro. 20. 22. by ſtirring up enemies that have conſpired together againſt the Church to deſtroy one another: 2 King. 19. 35 by ſending his Angell to deſtroy in one night 185000. To theſe viſible evidences may be added ſuch phraſes in Scripture, as aſcribe the waging of warre, diſcomfiting of enemies, and victories to the Lord: ſuch as theſe, Exo. 14 25: 
                              The Lord fighteth. 
                              Ioſ. 10. 10. 
                              The Lord diſcomfited them, and ſlew them. 
                              Iudg 7, 22. 
                              The Lord ſet every mans ſword upon his neighbour. 
                              1 Sam. 14 15. 
                              The earth was ſtricken with feare by God. 
                              2 Sam 5. 24. 
                              the Lord goeth out to ſmite the host.
                           
                           This the Lord doth both to encourage his people, and alſo to daunt his enemies.
                           Feare not therefore O Church and People of God. 2 Chro. 20. 20 
                              Believe in the Lord your God, ſo ſhall ye be establiſhed.

                              If God be for us who can be againſt us? Well may we on this ground ſay, 2 King 6. 16.

                           And know O ye enemies that you have more then fleſh

and bloud to fight againſt you: even the Lord of hoſts in whoſe power your breath is. Act. 9. 5. 
                              It is hard to kicke against the pricks.

                              THey are malicious and implacable enemies against whom Gods wrath is implacable. How malicious and implacable enemies the Amalekites were, againſt whom the Lord ſweareth, hath beene ſhewed §. 2. before. Little (if at all) better minded were the Ier. 46. 18, 19. 
                              Egyptians, 
                              Zeph. 2. 9. 
                              Moabites, Ammonites, 
                              Iſa. 14. 24, 25. 
                              Aſſyrians, Babylonians, and other enemies againſt whom God with like reſolution did ſweare vengeance. Theſe phraſes, 1. Sam. 2. 30. 
                              They that deſpiſe me ſhalbe deſpiſed. 
                              Lev. 26. 23. 
                              If ye walke contrary to me, I will walke contrary to you, ſaith the Lord Iſal. 18. 26. 
                              With the froward thou wilt ſhew thy ſelfe froward. Theſe and ſuch like phraſes ſhew, that it is mens implacableneſſe which maketh God implacable.
                           When men are dealt withall according to their owne dealings, God is juſtified, and men are brought to ſight of their folly: whereby if repentance be not wrought in them, their blacke mouthes wilbe ſtopped, and kept from barking againſt Gods ſeverity.
                           1. They that deſire to underſtand Gods mind againſt them, let them take notice of their owne mind againſt God and his Church.
                           2. They that deſire that God ſhould ceaſe ſmiting before they are conſumed, let them ceaſe to provoke Gods wrath. Fire will burne ſo long as fuell is put to it.

                              WArre is a meanes of utter ruine. When God would have the Canaanites and other nations whoſe land he had given to Iſrael, to be rooted out, he ſtirres up Ioſ. 12. 6, 7. 
                              Moſes, Ioſhua, and the Iſraelites under them to make warre againſt them. By warre was 2 King. 17. 6. 
                              Samaria, and —25. 9. 
                              Ieruſalem ruined. So was the ſpacious and populous city of Troy. It was made as an open field. The foure great Monarchs

                           Warres ordered by God are the inſtruments of his wrath and juſtice againſt impenitent people: in juſtice therefore they cauſe utter ruine in ſuch cauſes. As for men that delight in warre, they are commonly cruell and mercileſſe. No marvell then though they, where they can, utterly deſtroy all before them.
                           Should men now delight in warre? True it is that lawfull it is, and neceſſary, as hath beene proved §. 13. before. But, it is mans iniquity that makes it a lawfull remedy, and neceſſary. It is directly contrary to comfortable and profitable peace, and in that reſpect ſtiled Iſa. 45. 7.

                              DIvine vengeance may continue age after age. The extent of that vengeance which is denounced in the law giveth evidence hereof: for it ſaith, that, Exo. 20. 5.—347. Num. 14. 18. 
                              The Lord viſiteth the ſins of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation. This in particular is threatned against Iſa. 13. 20. Ier. 50 39. 
                              Babel, that executed much cruelty upon the people of God. By a propheticall ſpirit the Pſal. 109. 13. Pſalmiſt imprecateth as much againſt the enemies of Chriſt.
                           1. Rom. 2. 4. 2 Pet. 3. 9. Gods patience and long ſuffering is one cauſe hereof. For, he doth not utterly deſtroy and cut off all at once that give him cauſe ſo to do, to try, if by forbearing the extremity of vengeance, they or their poſterity may be brought to repentance. Read Ier. 26. 18, 19, &amp;c.
                           2. Gods jealouſie, and fiery indignation is alſo a cauſe of the continuance of vengeance. For, his wrath is ſuch a laſting fire, as if it be once kindled, it cannot eaſily be put out. The Law before the fore-named denunciation premiſeth this cauſe, Exo. 20. 5. 
                              The Lord is a jealous God.
                           
                           3. Mens perſiſting in their impiety, they and their poſterity is another cauſe hereof, and that the more immediate and meritorious cauſe: which Ier. 44. 21, 22. the Prophet expreſly upbraideth to the rebellious generation of the rebellious Iewes. The law mentioneth this cauſe in this clauſe, Exo. 20. 5. 
                              Of them that hate me.
                           
                           Here have we a ready anſwer to ſuch as take boldneſſe to Eccl. 8. 11. themſelves, becauſe they behold not the whole wrath of God powred out at once. But here they may learne that God can have warre with his enemies generation after generation: now ſlaying ſome, then others, and at length all. It was above 400 yeares before all Amalek was utterly deſtroyed: yet here by Ioſhua were many ſlaine. After this, more by Iudg. 6. 33. 
                              Gideon, yea —10. 17. more alſo by other Iudges. By Saul they were 1 Sam. 14. 48. once, and —15. 7. againe ſmitten: and finally, by —30. 17. 
                              David they were utterly vanquiſhed. And whereas, many

generations after this, Eſt. 3. 1. 
                              Haman the Agagite, who was of this ſtocke, got ſome head, the Lord had warre with him, and deſtroyed —7. 10. him, and —9. 10. his poſterity.
                           Let children of wicked parents, and ſucceeding generations of impious predeceſſors take heed how they tread in the wicked foot-ſteps of ſuch as have gone before them: eſpecially where there are enſignes diſplaid of Gods battels againſt them. For, in ſuch caſes he uſeth to have warre from generation to generation. Be not as your wicked fore-fathers were. But ceaſe yet to ſin againſt God, that he may ceaſe to warre againſt you. We have worthy preſidents hereof in 2 Chro. 29. 6, &amp;c.

                           §. 85. Of the evils of warre.
                           1. FOr warre multitudes of men are gathered: and thoſe for the moſt part luſty, ſtout, and ſtrong men. In ſuch multitudes it is ſcarce poſſible to have none but ſuch as feare God. Many, many armies there have beene in all ages, wherein not one, that truly feared God, could be found. Very few armies have beene heard of, whereof the greater

                                       que
                                     iuſtitium ob bellorum frequentiam. Hier, in Zac. 8. part have beene men truly religious, and men fearing God: but rather impious, licentious, and violent perſons. Where multitudes of ſuch are aſſembled together, what miſchiefes may not be feared?
                           2. For warre men uſe to be furniſhed with all kind of deadly weapons, and mortall munition, whereby ſouldiers are the more emboldened to all manner of outrages: much cruelty is thereby occaſioned. Hence it comes to paſſe that men aſſembled in armies account all that they can come by, be it by hooke or crooke, right or wrong, to be as their owne. So as the places thorow which they paſſe, and where they make any ſtay, ſuffer much prejudice by them. Inſtance the Danites that robbed Michah, (Iudg. 18. 16. 17, 25.) This undoubtedly was the cauſe that moved Iohn the Baptist to warne the ſouldiers that came to be inſtructed by him to take heed of doing violence, Luke 3. 14. For, the more potent men are, the more forward they are to oppreſſe others. And as for juſtice, it uſeth to ſleep when war moſt waketh
                           3. To maintaine warre, rich treaſures are oft exhauſted, ſubjects much oppreſſed, many husbands taken from their wives, parents from their children, maſters from their families, all ſorts of men from their callings. Trades thereby do much decay, and lands are oft left untilled. Yea of thoſe that are ſo preſt out to the war, many never returne home againe: whereby it comes to paſſe that many women are made widowes; many children fatherleſſe, many old, impotent parents childleſſe, and other friends friendleſſe, to their utter undoing.
                           4. In war many are brought into moſt lamentable diſtreſſes,

and yet no comfort, no ſuccor afforded unto them. Some in the battell have an arme, a leg, or ſome other limb cut off, whereby they are diſabled to helpe themſelves; and yet though they call and cry for helpe, no man pittieth them: but oft lie trampled upon by men and horſes to their greater torture. Among other ends of Flutes, Fifes, Trumpets, Drummes, and ſuch like loud ſounding inſtruments in warre, this is ſaid to be one, that the complaints and cries of wounded men might not be heard. If ſome of theſe by their own paines, or helpe of their fellow ſouldiers being wounded get out of the army, they may notwithſtanding feele the ſmart of their wound, and find the loſſe of their limbs or ſenſes to their dying day.
                           5. By warre many are taken captives, whom malicious and mortall enemies (ſo taken) oft put to exquiſite torments: as the Syrians, who threſhed Gilead with threſhing inſtruments of iron, Am. 1. 3. and the Edomites, who ript up the women with child of Gilead, Am. 1. 13. and the Moabites, who burnt the bones of the King of Edom unto lime, Am. 2. 1. and Adonibezek, who having cut off the thumbs and great toes of 70 Kings, made them gather their meate under his table, Iudg. 1. 7. and the Caldees, who ſlew the ſonnes of Zedekiah before his eyes, and then put out the eyes of the ſaid King, and bound him with ſetters of braſſe, &amp;c. 2 King. 25. 7. and the Philiſtines, who tooke Sampſon, and put out his eyes, and bound him with fetters of braſſe, and made him grind in their priſon houſe, Iudg. 16. 21. Others taken by enemies, though they be not ſo tortured, yet may be made perpetuall ſlaves.
                           6. By warre ſtrangers and enemies invade others countries and kingdomes, enter into them, thruſt out the true Lords therof, take away lands and inheritances, with all their goods and cattell from the true owners: abrogate good lawes: make cruell edicts; deprive people of their priviledges and immunities: make noble men meane; rich men poore: free men ſlaves: deflowre mens wives, raviſh their virgins, rip up their women with child, trample on old folkes, toſſe little children on pikes, cauſe weeping,

wailing, and bowling by reaſon of their ſavage cruelty in every place. Good cauſe therfore had the Pſalmiſt to pray, that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our ſtreets, Pſal., 4

                           7. By warre more bloud uſeth to be ſhed then any other 
                                 Cerne cruento borrore caſtrorum bella ubi

We read of 70000 deſtroyed by a plague thorowout all Iſrael within the ſpace of three dayes, 2 Sam. 24. 15. But by the ſword there were ſlaine in one battell (which may well be ſuppoſed to be in one day) 500000: and of whom? of children, of old, poore, impotent perſons? ſuch as for the moſt part are taken away by plague and famine? No verily; but 500000 choice men, 2 Chro. 13. 17. We read of huge hoſts indefinitely ſet downe, ſo as they may be ſuppoſed to conſiſt of many hundred thouſands, ſo vanquiſhed, and deſtroyed, as none eſcaped, 2 Chro. 20. 24. Yea, we read of whole cities, one after another utterly deſtroyed: even all that were in them, man and woman, young and old, and oxe and ſheepe, and aſſe with the edge of the ſword, Ioſ. 6. 21. &amp; 10. 28, 30, 32, 33, 35, 37, 39, 40. When God would utterly deſtroy a ſtocke and all appertaining thereto, the ſword hath beene uſed as his inſtrument to effect that judgement. Inſtance the caſe of Ieroboam and Baaſha, 1 King. 15. 29. &amp; 16. 11. Yea and of Ahab alſo, 2 King. 10. 11. The Amorites likewiſe, Canaanites, and other nations were utterly rooted out by the ſword.
                           8. In warre moſt unnaturall ſlaughters are oft committed. For, it may and oft doth fall out that one brother warreth 
                                 Marte cadunt ſubiti per mutua vulnera fratres. Ovid. Metamorph. lib. 3. fab. 1. on one ſide, and another on the contrary ſide: So father and ſonne: and other neare kinsfolke, and deare friends. Whence it comes to paſſe that a brother kils a brother, a father a ſonne, a ſonne a father, a kinſman a kinſman, a friend a friend: By warre the eleven Tribes had almoſt utterly deſtroyed the Tribe of Benjamin, which made them weep ſore, Iudg. 21. 2 It cannot be otherwiſe thought but that in the bloudy warres betwixt the houſe of Saul and the houſe of David, and betwixt Iudah and Iſrael, many a kinſman ſlew one another. This when it is knowne, pierceth ſo deeply

into the ſoule, as no cure can ever be made thereof. Oedipus 
                              Senec. Traged 3 quae dicitur Thebais Idem Traged 5 quae dictur Oedipus. Caecil Stat. in Theb. Ovid in Ibin &amp; 3 Faſt. having underſtood that in a conflict he had killed his father, (though he did it ignorantly and caſually, yet) he pulled out his owne eyes in revenge of himſelfe. The two ſonnes of Oedipus, namely Eteocles and Polynices, waging warre one againſt another, ſlew each the other. Telegonus alſo killed his owne father in a tumult. Theſe wofull accidents do moſt uſually happen in civill warres.
                           9. By warre not onely living perſons are ſlaine, ſo as townes, cities, and nations have been diſpeopled, but corne fields burnt, fruit trees cut downe, barnes, garners, and other like places filled with all kind of graine, and other proviſion for man and beaſt, deſtroyed and conſumed: towers and wals beaten downe: houſes of men, and houſes of God, even ſacred temples ſet on fire, and burnt downe to the ground. The moſt ſacred houſe of God that ever was, that glorious Temple which Solomon built was not in this kind ſpared, 2 King. 25. 9. Yea famous cities, and townes, and kingdomes have by warre beene made heaps of rubbiſh, and deſolate wilderneſſes, full of bryers and thornes, and habitations for wild beaſts, dragons, owles, and other dolefull creatures. For proofe read Iſa. 7. 20, 
                                 •
                              4. &amp; 13. 20, &amp;c. &amp; 17. 1, 2. &amp; 34. 9, &amp;c. Ier. 50. 39 40. Zeph. 2. 13, 14. Iudg. 9. 45. Thus the ſword is not onely terrible to preſent living creatures, but alſo to all ſorts of creatures in preſent and future ages. As a 
                                 Sicut torrens qui valdè excurrit &amp; inundat, omnia ſecum rapit &amp; perdit, ita &amp; barbari illi invaſerunt omnes genecs, &amp; perdiderant, Chryſ. Hom 35. in Gen. 14. flood which runneth with a ſtrong ſtreame, and overfloweth, carieth away and deſtroyeth all, ſo barbarous ſouldiers invade and deſtroy all.
                           10. By warre the juſter cauſe, and better part is oft overthrowne, and put to the worſt. Herein (if in any other thing) is the proverbe verified, Might over commeth right. For, it falleth out in warre where multitudes are gathered on the one ſide, and on the other, as it doth in ſingle combates, and duels. The ſtronger and skilfuller, the more experienced and more active man may have the worſe cauſe, and yet overcome the other, though the juſter perſon. Hence is it that Infidels take occaſion of inſulting over Chriſtians,

Idolaters over Worſhippers of the true God, and the unrighteous over the righteous. The Prophets ſtood amazed hereat: and in an humble manner expoſtulated the caſe with God, as, Hab. 1. 13, &amp;c. Lam. 4. 20. Pſal. 44. 9, &amp;c. &amp; 74. 4, &amp;c. &amp; 79. 1, &amp;c.

                              Queſt. HAth not God the ordering of battels? Doth not he give victory to whom he will? Is there any reſtraint to the Lord to ſave by many or by few? If ſo, why hath not the better part alwayes the better ſucceſſe and victory?
                           
                              Anſw. Moſt true it is that the iſſue of warre is diſpoſed by the Lord: and that it is nothing with him to helpe, whether 
                              See §. 77. 2 Chro. 14. 11. 
                              with many, or with them that have no power. Yet can we not thence in ferre that the better ſide ſhall alway have the victory. For,
                           1. How unſearchable are his judgements, and his wayes past finding out, Rom. 11. 33.
                           2. They who are accounted the better perſons, and have the better cauſe, may have ſome ſecret cauſes in them deſerving puniſhment, for which the Lord wiſely and juſtly ſuffereth them to fall into their enemies hands: and ſo giveth them occaſion to ſearch out that which lyeth hid, Ioſh. 7. 13.
                           3. Though the perſons which wage warre, and the cauſe for which it is waged, be righteous, yet their manner of waging may be ſuch as God be juſtly provoked therby to give them over to their enemies, as he did the Iſraelites when they went about to revenge the villany of the men of Gibeah, Iudg. 20. 21. Saints may be too confident in their owne might and wit. They may be zealous in puniſhing others ſinnes, and yet harbour ſecret ſinnes among themſelves. They may enter battell without ſeeking the Lord aright. For theſe and other like reaſons may the Lord ſuffer them to faile in their attempts.
                           
                              
4. The unrighteous oft prevaile againſt the righteous, that thereby they may be Gods rod to puniſh his children. But what priviledge is this to the unrighteous? what damage is it to the righteous? The rod, when Gods worke is done, ſhalbe caſt into the fire. The Saint being a child of God that is beaten therewith, will thereby be bettered.
                           5. As for the Lords ſaving with few againſt many, and with them that have no power againſt ſuch as are mighty, and every way well furniſhed to the war, it is true in regard of Gods almighty and extraordinary power. But ordinarily ſucceſſe is given according to the means that are uſed. So as if the worſe part be better prepared with men more in number, and more valiant, and with more ſtore of better munition, ordinarily they get the upper hand thereby. In this reſpect Chriſt giveth advice to conſider how an enemy is prepared, and anſwerably to go out againſt him, or to ſeek peace with him, Luke 14. 31, 32.

                              Anſw. 1. The lawfulneſſe of warre ariſeth from the §. 17. Ex animo hominum vitioſo bellum erumpit. Chryſ. in Mat. 10. Hom. 36. neceſſity thereof: and the neceſſity of warre from the iniquity of men. Becauſe ambitious and injurious men cannot otherwiſe be reſtrained then by warre, or becauſe there is no other way to puniſh ſuch malefactors, it is lawfull and needfull after ſuch a manner to draw out and uſe the ſword of the Lord againſt them.
                           2. The §. 17. uſefulneſſe of warre ariſeth from the good effects that iſſue from a juſt undertaking, a wiſe managing, and a proſperous finiſhing of the ſame. But, the evils of war ariſe from the ill diſpoſition of ſuch as are without juſt cauſe incited thereto, and being armed with power, abuſe the ſame to the ſatisfying of their inhumane humour. Many evils ariſe

from the ſupreme authority of a Monarch, when he turnes it into a tyranny: yet is ſuch a ſupreme authority moſt warrantable and profitable.
                        
                        
                           §. 88. Of warre the ſoreſt judgement.
                           
                              The evils of warre being ſuch as have beene §. 84. ſhewed, we may well inferre theſe concluſions following.
                           
                           I. VVArre is the heavieſt of Gods judgements. There are three publique judgement called Ezek. 5. 16. 
                              evill arrowes. Arrowes, becauſe they are ſharpe and deadly; piercing to the very heart of a man. Evill, by reaſon of their effects, the evils and miſchiefs which they worke. In this reſpect ſaith the Lord, Deut. 32. 23. 
                              I will heape miſchiefs upon them, I will ſpend mine arrowes upon them. Gods arrowes are called instruments of death, Pſal. 7. 13. The three moſt fearefull judgements, which are moſt uſually called Gods arrowes, are Plague, Famine, Sword. The ſoreſt of all theſe is the Sword. Evident is this by the anſwer which David gave to Gad, who from the Lord put thoſe three to his choice. One of them muſt be endured: but which of them, he himſelfe might chuſe. Thereupon he ſupplicated againſt the ſword, in theſe words, Let me not fall into the hands of man. Hereby he 2 Sam. 241 14. ſhewed that he accounted the ſword the moſt terrible judgement: and withall intimateth the reaſon thereof: becauſe it is put into mans hands; ſo as Plague and Famine is more immediately ordered by God, then Warre. Men are made the inſtruments thereof. And their anger is fierce, and their wrath cruell. Yea, they prove many times inſatiable in their Gen. 49. 7. Homo homini lupu
                                       •
                                    . Plaut in Aſinar. cruelty: as wolves when they enter among a flocke of ſheepe. For (as it is in the proverbe) Man is a wolfe to man: as cruell one to another, as a wolfe to ſheepe: one undermining, one devouring another, as they can get any advantage one againſt another.
                           Beſides, warre more uſually cauſeth both plague and famine, then either of them cauſeth warre. If a plague rage

a citie or country, enemies wilbe afraid to ſend an army thither, leaſt they be all infected and deſtroyed with the plague. So if famine thorow ſcarcity of food deſtroy the inhabitants of a land, enemies will forbeare to invade it (eſpecially if they be not able to bring with them proviſion enough for horſe and man to ſo remote a place) fearing leaſt they and their cattell be all ſtarved. Thus theſe two judgements may be ſome meanes to avert warre. But warre ordinarily cauſeth plague and famine. Theſe Lev. 26. 25, 26. Ier. 14. 12. Ezek. 6. 11. three, Sword, Pestilence, Famine, are very oft joyned together: and for the moſt part, Sword is put in the firſt place, as the cauſe of the other two. Plagues oft ariſe from multitudes of people thwacked together, from noiſome ſavours, from want of cleane ſhiftings, from unwholſome food, from infected aire, and other like cauſes which are ordinarily occaſioned by warre: eſpecially, when people are by enemies blocked up, and have not liberty to goe abroad, and to provide for themſelves.
                           In Ieruſalem, when it was beſieged by the Babylonians 
                              Ier. 21. 6, 7. there was a great peſtilence, and much famine: but much greater Ioſeph. de Bello Iud. l. 6. c. 11. when it was beſieged by the Romanes. The firſt great plague that was in Queene Elizabeths daies was brought into England by the ſouldiers that came from Stow in his generall Chron. of Engl. an. 4. Eliz. 
                              New haven that was ſomwhile beſieged, and after taken by the enemy.

                           If warre be an uſuall occaſion of plague and famine, it muſt needs be the greateſt of them: and if of them, ſurely the greateſt of other judgements.

                           II. NO true Christian can, or may delight in warre. He may §. 17, 18. on juſt cauſe wage warre: but there is a great difference betwixt the doing of a thing, and delight therein. God doth afflict, and grieve children of men, but not Lam 3. 33.

                              his ſtrange worke, his ſtrange act. So ought warre to be unto Chriſtians. A true Chriſtians heart is poſſeſſed with true charity. But charity delighteth not in ſpoiles, in wounds, in paines, and tortures, in bloud of men, nor in any other evils that warre ordinarily cauſeth. They are therefore deſtitute of true Chriſtian charity, and in that reſpect, no true Chriſtians that ſimply deſire warre, that without juſt and urgent cauſe raiſe warre, that with delight enbroile themſelves therein. They are worſe then ſavages, yea then ſavage beaſts. Though the Lord made many of the Heathen his rod to correct his people: yet becauſe they delighted in ſhedding bloud, the Lord brought heavy judgements upon them: as on Aſhur, Iſa. 10. 5, &amp;c. on Babylon, Iſa. 14. 4, &amp;c. Ier. 50. 23, 24. Hab. 2. 7, 8. on Mount Seir, Ezek. 35. 5, 6. Yea alſo upon the houſe of Iehu, who deſtroyed the ſtocke of Ahab, Hoſ. 1. 4.
                        
                        
                           §. 90. Of Chriſtians backwardneſſe to warre.
                           III. CHriſtians ought to be very backward to warre. The evils thereof are ordinarily ſo many, as they ſhould make a Chriſtian trie all other faire meanes for retaining or recovering his owne, and for preventing or redreſſing wrongs, then by warre to ſeeke the accompliſhing of his deſire. Chriſtians ſhould be affected to warre as the Apoſtle would have them to law, 1 Cor. 6. 1, &amp;c. They ought not to uſe it but in the laſt place, after all other good meanes have beene uſed, as a deſperate remedy, when no other remedy will ſerve the turne. Vrgent neceſſity ſhould force Chriſtians to warre. The evill effects of warre cannot but be

very grievous to a true Chriſtian ſoule. How then may he be forward to that which cauſeth ſuch evill effects? See the caution even for juſt warres, before given in the latter end of §. 18.
                        
                        
                           §. 91. Of circumſpection in waging warre.
                           IIII. GReat circumſpection must be uſed in waging war. Many evils ordinarily ariſing from warre, if men be not watchfull over themſelves, pride, wrath, revenge, cruelty, and many other corruptions, whereunto our nature is much prone, will ſoone find occaſion to diſplay themſelves, by reaſon of that power which men gathered together in an army, have. David, a man in a great meaſure renewed, Act. 13. 22. yea a man after Gods owne heart, 
                              1 Sam. 25. 22. being accompanied with an army of valiant men, upon a diſcurteſie offered unto him by a churle, was ſo incenſed with rage, and enflamed with revenge, as he vowed, and ſwore to deſtroy all that pertained to that churliſh Nabal, before the next morning. If ſuch a man, by reaſon of his warlike power, was ſo ſoone provoked to ſo great an evill, what will not warre provoke others unto, eſpecially if they be confident in their power, and get any advantages againſt their enemies. Wherfore, to prevent the evils of war, ſuch as have juſt occaſion of waging war, muſt look to their manner of waging war, and lay aſide al malice, envy, wrath, revenge, deſire of bloud, cruelty, &amp; other inhumane paſſions: and continually walk before him, carying themſelves as in the preſence of God, ordering all their actions according to the word of God; yea and oft looking to God, calling upon him, and doing ſuch things as in the good ſucceſſe of them may give them juſt cauſe to praiſe God. Thus may we avoid the ordinary evils of warre.
                        
                        
                           
                           §. 92. Of warre kept out of a land.
                           V. IT is a bleſſing to have warre kept out of a land. Warre being a cauſe of many evils, to have war kept out, is to be freed from thoſe many evils. This is that caſe, wherof the Pſalmiſt thus ſaith, Pſal 144. 15. 
                              Happy is that people that is in ſuch a caſe. This was the happineſſe of Salomons raigne; for, 1 Chro. 22 9 God gave him reſt from all his enemies round about. As a bleſſing on Iehoſaphat and his kingdome, it is recorded, that, 2 Chro. 17. 10 
                              The feare of the Lord fell upon all the kingdome of the lands that were round about Iudah, ſo that they made no warre against Iehoſaphat.
                           
                           Thrice happy is England in this reſpect, that under the bleſſed government of Queene Elizabeth, King Iames, and our now (and long may be be our now) royall Soveraigne, King Charles, hath beene preſerved from warre, the cauſe of many evills, and from the many evills of warre. It cannot be denied, but that in bleſſed Queene Elizabeths daies, there was much warre: and that many attempts were made by enemies abroad, and traitors at home to diſturbe our Peace, extirpate our Religion, and ruinate our State: but they all turned to the increaſe of our happineſſe, in that we are delivered from them all, and ſo preſerved from the evils of open hoſtility, and privy conſpiracy, as thoſe attempts proved thorow the divine providence more glorious, and many wayes beneficiall to Soveraigne and Subjects, to Church and Common-wealth, then ignominious, or any way prejudiciall.
                           That there may be better notice taken hereof to enlarge our hearts the more to praiſe God, and to move us the more ſecurely and confidently to caſt our care on him, I hope it will not be unſeaſonable here to ſet down a particular catalogue of ſuch deliverances from the foreſaid evils, as God hath given us ſince the beginning of that bleſſed Queenes raigne.
                           
                        
                        
                           
                           §. 93. Of Englands Deliverances, ſince Queene Elizabeth began her Raigne.
                           1. GOD preſerved Queene Elizabeth from death in the time of her ſiſter Queene Mary. For, being charged with conſpiracy in the caſe of Sr. Thomas Wyats riſing, but moſt unjuſtly, was ſent as a priſoner to the Tower 
                              An. Dom. 1553. 1. Mar. 
                              of London. Her death was in thoſe dayes many wayes plotted, but by the divine Providence all thoſe plots were diſappointed.
                           2. When by the death of Queene Mary the Crowne and Kingdome by juſt and unqueſtionable title deſcended on her, the whole Land profeſſed a religion contrary to the Religion 17. Nov. 1558. which ſhe profeſſed, and the Peeres and Commons were then aſſembled in Parliament, and that with purpoſe to ſettle Popery (as it is likely) more firmly in this land; yet did the Lord move their hearts then and there to acknowledge her title, and that by the mouth of Doctor Heath, then Arch-Biſhop of Yorke, and Lord Chancellour of England, ſo as ſhe was forth with openly proclaimed Queen of England, and anſwerably with as great joy and rejoycing as ever Prince was, received by her Subjects.
                           
                           3. Being crowned, ſhe found a potent Prince, namely, Henry the ſecond then the French King, to endeavour to ſet An Dom. 1559. Reg. 2. up another title of Mary then Queene of Scots, who was maried to Francis his ſonne. To them they gave this title, Francis and Mary by the grace of God, of Scotland, England, 
                              Franciſcus &amp; Maria Dei gratia Scotiae, Angliaeo &amp; Hiberniae Rex &amp; Regina.
                               
                              and Ireland King and Queene. Anſwerably they quartered the Armes of England with the Armes of Scotland. To ſettle the ſaid Mary in the roome of Queene Elizabeth, an army was ſent out of France into Scotland, to joyne with the Scots, and to invade England: and the Pope was dealt withall to declare Elizabeth to be an heretique and illegitimate, and Mary to be the true Queene of England. But by the Divine Providence all this vaniſhed as ſmoke into the aire. For, the Scots refuſed to joyne with the French againſt England. Yea, they deſired and obtained aid of Queene
                              
                              Elizabeth to thruſt the French out of Scotland.
                           
                           4. Philip King of Spaine earneſtly deſired mariage with An. Dom. 1559 Reg. 2. 
                              Queene Elizabeth, notwithſtanding his late mariage with Queene Mary ſiſter to Queene Elizabeth. Now becauſe Gods Word expreſly forbiddeth one man to mary two ſiſters, he pretended to get a diſpenſation from the Pope. But all his endeavours about ſo impious a matter, nought prevailed with ſo pious a Prince. Wherefore he endeavoured to make a mariage betwixt Queene Elizabeth, and Charles, ſon of Ferdinand then Emperour, and uncle to the ſaid Philip. All was to bring the Kingdome of England to his owne linage and family. But neither could this attempt take effect. Whereupon Philip King of Spaine became an utter enemy to that royall Queene, which enmity (thorow the divine providence) turned to Queene Elizabeths glory.
                           5. Arthur Poole of the race of George Duke of Clarence, 
                              An. Dom. 1562 Reg. 4. of the houſe of Yorke, with ſundry of his kindred and alliance conſpired to ſet againe on foot the title of Mary Queene of Scots, and to bring an army out of France into Wales, to make their challenge good; but they were before the execution of their plot diſcovered, and themſelves condemned.
                           6. After the fore-mentioned emulation, yea, and enmity betwixt King Philip of Spaine, and Queene Elizabeth, one Pope after another was much ſolicited by Spaniſh and other Papiſts to excommunicate that pious Prince, upon pretence of hereſie. But till ſhe was made able to ſtand out againſt all her enemies, God kept away thoſe thunderbolts under Pope 
                              An. Dom. 1569 Reg. 11. The forme of this excommunication is in the very words thereof recorded in Camden. Annal. rerum Anglic. &amp; Hibern. Reg. Elizab. part. 2. MDLXX. 
                              Paulus 4. and Pius 4.
                           7. Pope Pius 5. a man of a fierce and fiery diſpoſition, was ſo farre wrought upon, as in the moſt ſolemne manner that he could, excommunicated, and anathematized bleſſed Queene Elizabeth, and cauſed a briefe thereof with his leaden bull annexed thereto, to be faſtned to the gate of the Biſhop of Londons pallace neare Pauls Church, by one Iohn Felton, who being apprehended, confeſſed the fact, and received condigne puniſhment on a gibbet before the ſaid

gate. This excommunication cauſed many troubles on mans part: but withall as many preſervations and deliverances on Gods part.
                           8. The Earles of Northumberland and Westmerland, thorow An. Dom. 1570 Reg. 12. promiſes of aid from the Pope and Spaniard, raiſed up a rebellion againſt Queene and State in the North-parts: but were ſoone diſcomfited. The Earle of Northumberland was taken and beheaded. The other Earle fled beyond ſea, and ended his daies in a poore and meane eſtate.
                           9. Iohn Story Doctor of Law, a ſpie to the Duke of Alva, 
                              An Dom. 1570. Reg. 12. conſpired with one Preſtol, a man much addicted to magick, and a ſubject to the King of Spaine, againſt the life of Queene Elizabeth. He ſent advertiſement to the Duke of Alva, how he might invade England, and make Ireland revolt. God bringing this treaſon to light, both Story and Prestol were by a Parliament adjudged guilty of high treaſon. Thereupon they received their juſt demerit.
                           10. The Biſhop of Roſſe practiced with ſundry Engliſh An. Dom. 1571. Reg. 13. men to intercept Queene Elizabeth, and to trouble the Parliament then ſitting, that ſo another Queene might be ſet up inſtead of Elizabeth. But there fell out ſuch mutuall miſtruſt among the Conſpirators, as their plots turned to their owne damage.
                           11. Iohn Duke of Auſtria, ambitiouſly affecting the kingdomes of England and Scotland, dealt with the Pope and An. Dom. 1576. Reg 18. 
                              King of Spaine for aid againſt England. For a pretence of title thereto, he ſought mariage with the next heire. But in the middeſt of his ambitious projects he ſuddenly died.
                           12. Thomas Stukely an Engliſh fugitive plotted with two Popes, Pius 5. and Gregorius 13. to lead forces into Ireland, 
                              An. Dom. 1578. Reg 20. there to joyne with the Rebells, and to conquer it for Pope Gregories baſtard ſonne. For this purpoſe he was made Generall of 8000 Italian ſouldiers. But by the perſwaſion of Sebaſtian King of Portugal he went with his troupes into Mauritania and was there ſlaine.
                           13. Nicolas Sanders an Engliſh Prieſt went further, for he with a banner conſecrated by the Pope, and an army of An. Dom. 1580. Reg 22.
                              
                              Spaniards entred into Ireland, joyned with the Rebels, cauſed a great inſurrection, but to the overthrow of himſelfe and all that tooke part with him.
                           14. Robert Parſons, Edmund Campion, and other Seminaries 
                              An. Dom. 1581. Reg. 23. and Incendiaries were ſent by the Pope from Rome into England, to draw the Queenes ſubjects from their allegiance, to prepare them to a change, and to take part with forraigne powers when they ſhould be ſent into England. Campion, Sherwin, Kirly, and Briant were convicted and condemned of high treaſon, and anſwerably executed. But their diveliſh attempts turned to a greater reſtraint of Papiſts in England, and a greater ſecurity of the Queenes Majeſty, and her State.
                           
                           15. Iohn Somervill was apprehended as he was comming An. Dom. 1583. Reg. 26. in a deſperate manner to kill the Queene, being moved thereto (as he himſelfe confeſſed) by reading certaine popiſh bookes written againſt the Queene by Seminaries. Being condemned, in New gate he ſtrangled himſelfe.
                           16. William Parry Doctor of Law, made promiſe and An. Dom. 1585 Reg. 27. vow to kill the Queenes Majeſty, and for that end obtained of the Pope, an abſolution for the fact before it was committed. But God ſtrucke his heart with ſuch terrour, as though he had opportunity, yet he put it off ſo long, as at length his purpoſe was diſcovered, and he received the juſt reward of a traitor.
                           17. Iohn Ballard a Romiſh Priest, ſtirred up the fiery ſpirits An. Dom. 1586 Reg. 27. of certaine Popiſh Gentlemen to undertake to kill the Queene, as ſhe ſhould go abroad to take the aire: which though they had vowed to do, yet was their unnaturall treaſon diſcovered before they had the opportunity to do it. At their arraignment they were found guilty of high treaſon againſt the Queenes perſon, of ſtirring civill warres in the Realme, and of practicing to bring in forraigne power. Foureteene of them were as traitors executed.
                           17. William Stafford a young Gentleman, and one Moody 
                              An. Dom. 1587. Reg. 29. a deſperate man, were by a forraigne Ambaſſadour lying in England, perſwaded to kill the Queene. But the

plot was diſcovered before it was effected.
                           19. The inveterate hatred of Philip King of Spaine 
                              An. Dom. 1588. Reg. 30. againſt Queene Elizabeth, and his unſatiable ambition and deſire of enjoying England as his owne; was at length openly manifeſted by an huge navy, ſuppoſed, and thereupon intituled invincible, ſet to ſea againſt England. But the Lord of ſea and land ſoone diſappointed their hopes. The navy was diſſipated on the ſea, and England ſecured.
                           20. Rodericke Lopez a Iew, Phyſitian in ordinary to her An. Dom. 1593. Reg. 35. Majeſty, upon promiſe of 50000 crownes to be ſent him out of Spaine, undertooke to poyſon the Queene. But before the hire came, the treaſon was diſcovered, and the traitor executed.
                           21. Patrick Cullin an Iriſh Fencer, was hired by Engliſh An. Dom. 1594. Reg. 36. runagates in the Low Countries to kill the Queene: and with that purpoſe came over: but intelligence being given thereof, he was apprehended and executed.
                           22. Edmond York and Richard Williams hired in like An. eodem. manner to the like, namely to kill her Majeſty, and to ſet on fire her navy with balls of wild-fire, were prevented and executed.
                           23. Edward Squire being in a ſhip on ſea, taken by the An. Dom. 1598. Reg. 40. Spaniards, and brought into Spaine, was there ſuborned and directed by Richard Walpoole an Engliſh fugitive and a Ieſuite to poiſon the Queene, by laying a ſtrong poiſon (which the Ieſuite there gave him) on the pommell of the ſaddle whereon the Queene ſhould ride: that ſhe laying her hand thereon, might cary the ſent thereof to her noſe, and thereby receive it into her body: which if ſhe had done, it had beene her death. Never any treaſon came ſo neare to the execution as this. For the traitor Squire obſerved his direction, did the deed, and that, immediately before the Queene rid forth. But the divine providence kept her from touching the pommell with her hand. Yet the treaſon was diſcovered, and the traitor received condigne puniſhment.
                           24. The Earle of Tyrone, an Iriſh man, having beene ſome while in Spaine, returned from thence An. Dom. 1599 Reg. 41.
                              
with a rebellious mind, and raiſed by the aſſiſtance of the Spaniard and popiſh faction in Ireland a rebellion. More damage accrued to Queene and State by this rebellion, then any other way all her dayes. Yet thorow the conſtant providence of God this rebell alſo was brought under, and that land ſecured.
                           25. There was a plot for removing ſome of the Queenes 
                              An. Dom. 1600 Reg. 42. chief Officers and Counſellors from her: which (if it had not beene prevented) might have proved dangerous to her Perſon and State: and ſo much the rather becauſe there were Papists which had a great hand in that conſpiracy. Therein therefore was the divine Providence manifeſted by preſerving her Majesty in ſafety.
                           26. Henry Garnet Superiour of the Ieſuites in England, Robert Treſmond Ieſuite, Robert Catesby, Francis Treſham, 
                              An. Dom. 1602 Reg. 44, 45. and others, in the name of all the Romiſh Catholiques in England, imploy Thomas Winter into Spaine, to obtaine an army from Spaine to joyne with the forces of Papiſts in England, to change the government, and religion thereof. There being then hoſtility betweene Spaine and England, the motion was readily embraced by the Spaniard; and 100000 crownes promiſed to helpe forward the buſineſſe. But before any thing could be effected, Queene Elizabeth, full of Queene Elizabeth was borne at Greenwich, 7. Sept. 1533. and died at Richmond, 24. Mar 1602. She began her raigne 17. Nov 1558 and ended her raigne with her life 24. Mar. 1602. yeares, in peace, on her bed, ended her dayes: being 69 yeares, 6 moneths, and 17 dayes old: a greater age then any other King or Queene of England from the Conqueſt attained to. She was about the age of David King of Iſrael when he died: who lived the longeſt of all the Kings of Iſrael and Iudah. She raigned 44 yeares, 4 moneths, and 7 daies.
                           Doubtleſſe many more treaſons were intended and plotted againſt her, then are recorded: but ſhe was kept ſo ſure and ſecure under the wings of the Almighty, whoſe truth ſhe conſtantly maintained (herein eſpecially ſhewing her ſelfe to be SEMPER EADEM, alwaies the ſame) as no open hoſtility, no privy conſpiracy ever prevailed againſt her. Her preſervation much made to our ſecurity. The remembrance

therefore thereof ought ever to be freſh among us, that ſo long as the benefit thereof continueth, which will be ſo long as true Religion continueth among us, due praiſes may be yeelded to her and our Protectour.
                        
                        
                           §. 94. Of Gods Providence to England in King Iames his time.
                           1. THe day of Queene Elizabeths departure out of this life, was the day long expected by Papists, as a day 24. Mar, 1602. for rooting out our Religion, and altering our government. For, Pope Clement 8. had ſent the yeare before two Bulls, to interdict all claime or title to the Crown of England, though never ſo directly and nearly intereſſed by diſcent, to all ſuch as would not by their beſt endeavours promote the Catholique cauſe, and by ſolemne and ſacred oath religiouſly ſubſcribe thereto. But God who approveth our Religion, and deteſteth their ſuperſtition, or rather idolatry, made all their hopes utterly fruſtrate. For, in the ſetting of one Sun immediately aroſe another, and that in full brightneſſe, to the unſpeakable Occubult ſol: nox nulla ſecuta eſt. comfort of all true hearted Engliſhmen, and to the utter aſtoniſhment of all popiſh enemies of this flouriſhing State. In the ſame morning wherein Queene Elizabeth died, Queene Elizabeth died about two in the morning. About eight King Iumes was proclaimed at Court: &amp; about eleven in Cheape-ſide An Dom. 1603 Reg. 1. was King Iames firſt at the Court gate, and then at the Croſſe in Cheape ſide, with wonderfull great acclamations, and all manner of manifeſtations of joy, proclaimed King. An eſpeciall evidence of the divine providence.
                           2. In the firſt yeare of his Majesties raigne, before he was ſolemnly annointed and crowned, Watſon and Cleark two Romiſh Prieſts, conſpired with others, ſome noble men, ſome Knights, and ſome Gentlemen, to ſurprize King Iames, and Prince Henry, preſuming on forraigne forces for aid and aſſiſtance, thereby to alter religion, and to ſet up ſuch Officers of State, as they thought beſt. But their plot before it came to execution was diſcovered, they condemned, ſome of them executed, others ſpared thorow the Kings clemency.
                           
                              
3. Garnet and Treſmond Ieſuites, with Catesby and Treſham before mentioned, notwithſtanding the death of Queene Elizabeth, when they ſaw that King Iames defended the ſame faith, continued to ſolicite the King of Spaine to ſend an army into England, to joyne with the forces of Papiſts here, for extirpation of Religion. But the King of Spaine being then in treaty with the King of England about peace, refuſed to hearken to any ſuch motion. Thereupon they (together with other unnaturall and traiterous ſubjects) plotted the matchleſſe, mercileſſe, deviliſh, and damnable gun-powder-treaſon, whereof before, §. 67. If ever the The day appointed to blow up the Parliament with gun powder, was 5. Nov. 1605. Reg. Iacobi 3. eye of the divine providence did ſhew it ſelfe watchfull for the ſafety of England, it was in the diſcovery of this plot before it came to execution. Wherefore among other deliverances, this is to be had in perpetuall remembrance.
                           4. If we conſider the great hazard wherin bleſſed Charles, (then Prince, now our royall Soveraigne) was in going to Spaine, and returning from Spaine, on land and ſea; and withall if we well weigh the admirable and unutterable benefits which we enjoy by his happy raigne over us, we ſhall find juſt cauſe to put the day of his ſafe arrivall to England, 
                              6. Octob. 1623 Reg. Iacobi 20. into the catalogue of daies of memorials of Gods mercifull Providence over this Kingdome. From that day the creſts of Papiſts fell downe: eſpecially after the downfall of many An Dom. 1623 26. Oct. ſtilo vet. 5. Nov. ſtilo novo. of them at a Romiſh Prieſts ſermon in Blacke-Friers, London.
                           
                           Of the forementioned deliverances much more is recorded in Camdens Annales, Biſhop Carltons Collections, Speeds Hiſtory, and other Chronicles of England.
                           
                           For my purpoſe it is enough to have pointed at the heads of them.
                           Yet becauſe contraries laid together do more lively ſet out

Kings and Kingdome: that thus Gods bleſſing on us under the raignes of Queene Elizabeth, King Iames, and King Charles (by whom our light and life, the Goſpell is ſtill continued among us) may be the better diſcerned.
                        
                        
                           §. 95. Of the troubles of England from the Conqueſt to Queene Elizabeths time.
                           1. WIlliam, Duke of Normandie, ſurnamed The Conquerour, 
                              1066. Oct. 14 got the crowne with much bloud, having ſlaine Harold the King immediately before him, two of his brothers, and 67974 Engliſh men. He changed many of the lawes and cuſtomes of England. He defaced many Churches, and depopulated ſundry townes to make a forreſt for beaſts: where two of his owne ſonnes were ſtrangely ſlaine. The Danes to recover the Crowne, in his dayes invaded the land, burnt Yorke, and ſlew 3000 men. The Scots likewiſe about the ſame time made great ſpoile in England: and ſpared nor ſex nor age. Much trouble was in the land all his time. Being in France, and there ſetting a towne on fire, he rode ſo neare the fire, as his horſe with the heat therof gave ſuch a leap, as it brake the rimme of his belly, whereof he died, in the 21. yeare of his raigne, and 64 of his age. Being dead, he was denied buriall till much mediation was made, and a great compoſition paid.
                           2. William Ruſus ſon to the Conquerour, having an elder 1087. Sep. 9. brother then living, came not without difficulty to the crowne. He had much warre, both with his elder brother Robert, and alſo with his younger brother Henry. In his time were many warres with the Scots, and Welch, much Engliſh bloud ſpilt, and himſelfe caſually ſlaine by one of his ſubjects with an arrow ſhot at a ſtag, in the 13. yeare of his raigne, and 43 of his age. His corps were caried towards Winchester in a colliers cart.
                           3. Henry 1. youngeſt ſonne of William the Conquerour, 
                              1100. Aug. 1. put Robert his elder brother by the crowne: whence aroſe many broiles. He getting the maſtery over his brother, impriſoned him, and cruelly put out his eyes. He had much

warre with the Welch. All his children, but Mawde his daughter, with 160 perſons were drowned together. He died of a ſurfeit in the 36. yeare of his raigne, and 65. of his age.
                           4. Stephen with perjury uſurped the kingdome, from the 1135. Dec. 2. fore-ſaid Mawde. Beſides ſome warres abroad, he had continuall civill jarres at home: by reaſon whereof he was taken priſoner, and forced in the end to leave the heire of his oppoſite to be his ſucceſſour. He died of an Iliacke paſſion, mixed with the Emeroids, in the 19. yeare of his raigne. His body after it was interred, was taken out of the lead, and caſt into a river.
                           5. Henry 2. ſonne of the foreſaid Mawd, thorow his incontinency 1154. Oct. 25. with Roſamond, ſet his owne wife and children againſt him, which cauſed perpetuall unquietneſſe in his kingdome. In one battell at Edmondbury 20000 were taken and ſlaine. He adopted his ſonne (who laboured to diſthrone him) in the government: and having much embroiled the kingdome, he grew ſo diſcontented, as he curſt his children, and the day of his birth, and in much perplexity ended his daies in the 35. yeare of his raigne, and 61. of his age. Being dead, his people fell to ſpoile all he had, and left himnaked.
                           6. Richard 1. ſonne to Henry 2. having in his fathers life 1189. Iul. 6. vowed a journy to the Holy Land, had his kingdome in his abſence uſurped by Iohn his younger brother. Much trouble thence aroſe in England. On notice thereof, Richard haſted home: but in the way he was taken priſoner by the Duke of Auſtria. Whence though he were after 17 moneths impriſonment with a great ranſome releaſed, and reſtored to the Crowne, yet both he and his hingdome were in continuall trouble. As he was beſieging a caſtle, which would have yeelded unto him, if onely their lives might be ſaved (but he would not accept it on any condition) he was ſhot with a poiſoned arrow, and thereof died, in the 10. yeare of his raigne, and 45. of his age, and was buried at his fathers feet; whom he confeſſed he had betrayed.
                           
                              
7. Iohn younger brother to the foreſaid Richard, notwithſtanding 1199. Apr. 6. 
                              Arthur ſonne to his elder brother, and true heire to the Crowne, by might got the Kingdome. But himſelfe and his ſubjects, either with others, or among themſelves were in continuall broiles, and had many unſucceſſefull warres with French, Scots, and Welch. He was oppoſed by his Lords, depoſed by the Pope, poyſoned by a Monke, in the 18. yeare of his raigne, and 51. of his age.
                           8. Henry 3. eldeſt ſon of the foreſaid Iohn, began his 1216. Oct. 19. raigne when he was not full 10 yeares old, and the State very troubleſome. The miſeries of his raigne were almoſt infinite, by Invaſions, Rebellions, Exactions, and the ſundry calamities that follow ſuch diſaſters. Lewis the French King entred the land, many of the Barons tooke part with him. On both ſides very many were ſlaine. The King himſelfe by his Barons, with his brother Richard King of Almain, and his ſonne Prince Edward, taken priſoners. There were then ſlaine 4500. He died in the 57. yeare of his raigne, and 67. of his age.
                           9. Edward 1. was enbroiled in war againſt the Sarazens when his father died. There he received three wounds 1272. Nov. 16, with a poiſoned knife by a treacherous Aſſaſine: but by the daily licking of his ranckling wounds with the tongue of lady Elenor his wife, he is ſaid to be cured. With much glory he returned home, and was victorious againſt the Scots and Welch. Yet thoſe victories were not atchieved without the expence of much Engliſh bloud. He died as he was going with a mighty hoſt againſt the Scots, in the 35. yeare of his raigne, and 68. of his age.
                           10. Edward 2. (ſon to Edward 1.) was one of the moſt miſerable Kings that have raigned in England. The 1307. Iul. 7. Northerne parts were over-run and harried by the Scots. In the battell which was called the white battell, 3000 Yorkſhire men were ſlaine by the Scots. Rob. Bruſe King of Scots invading England, burned all the country before him. He had much civill warre with his Barons: and much bloud

was ſhed on both ſides. He was at length himſelfe impriſoned and depoſed, in the 20. yeare of his raigne, and 42. of his age: and about 8 moneths after cruelly broached to death withan hot iron ſpit.
                           11. Edward 3. ſon of Edward 2. came to the Crowne in 1326. Ian. 25. his fathers life-time, by his fathers forced reſignation thereof. His raigne was indeed glorious by forraigne victories, but the Kingdome was much exhauſted of men and mony, thorow ſundry expeditions into Scotland, France, and Spaine, which occaſioned great complaints of his Subjects. In his time Southampton was burnt by Pirates, and Carlile, with other places by the Scots, to the loſſe and vexation of many Subjects. At the time of his death all of all ſorts forſooke him. Onely one Prieſt is ſaid to be with him, when he gave up the ghoſt, in the 51. yeare of his raigne, and 65. of his age.
                           12. Richard 2. grand-child of Edward 3. came young to 1377. Iun. 21. the Crowne: and by ill counſell and ill courſes occaſioned many Invaſions, Oppreſſions, Inſurrections, Rebellions, and laſt, the depoſition of himſelfe, and untimely death. Wherupon enſued that fatall diviſion betwixt the two houſes of Yorke and Lancaſter, in purſuit of which quarrell were 13. maine battells fought: three 
                                 Henry 6. Edward 5. Richard 3. 
                              Kings beſides himſelfe, 
                                 Hen. 6. his ſon. Edw 5 his brother. two Princes, heires apparent, 12 Dukes, one Marqueſſe, 18 Earles, one Viſcount, 23 Barons, beſides Knights, and Gentlemen innumerable, were ſlaine. Richard 2. was depoſed in the 23. yeare of his raigne, and murdered about five moneths after in the 34. of his age.
                           13. Henry 4. as he got the Crowne by violence, ſo he held it by force, not without continuall feare, having all his 1399. Sept. 29. raigne either warres abroad, or conſpiracies and inſurrections at home, which coſt the lives of many Nobles and Commons. He died in the 14. yeare of his raigne, and 46 of his age.
                           14. Henry 5. ſonne to Henry 4. ſpent moſt of the time of 1412. Mar. 20. his raigne in warres in France. Very victorious he was therein: but haſtened his death thereby, and in the 10. yeare

of his raigne, and 34. of his age: leaving his crowne to an infant. What followed thereupon is now to be ſhewed.
                           15. Henry 6. ſonne of Henry 5. was crowned in the firſt 1422. Aug. 31. yeare of his age with the Crownes of two Kingdomes, but that of France which his father wonne, was ſoone loſt: and this of England was twice pluckt from his head in his life time. Many bloudy battels were fought in England betwixt the two great factions of Yorke and Lancaſter: wherein many thouſand ſubjects periſhed. This King at length was taken and impriſoned, the Queene his wife exiled, his ſonne and heire kild, his Counſellours ſlaine, the Crowne conferred on his corrivall, in the 39. yeare of his raigne, and he himſelfe murdered in the 50. of his age.
                           16. Edward 4. being of the houſe of Yorke, obtained the Crowne with much bloud, there being in one battell ſlaine 1460. Mar. 4. 36776 Engliſh men. There were civill warres almoſt all his raigne. He was taken and impriſoned, whence eſcaping, he was forced to fly the land: but returning with much hazard to his perſon, and death of many ſubjects, recovered the Crowne, but ſo as his children had little joy thereof. On a ſudden after a ſort he died, in the 23. yeare of his raigne, and 41. of his age.
                           17. Edward 5. Sonne of Edward 4. was for the ſpace of two moneths and 16 dayes accounted King, but never 1483. Apr. 9. crowned. For, he was murthered in the Tower, in the firſt yeare of his raigne, and 12. of his age.
                           18. Richard 3. brother to Edward 4. a bloudy tyrant, uſurped the Crowne, cauſed his Nephew (then King) together 1483. Iun. 22. with his brother, to be murthered, many of his Nobles and others to be put to death, ſo as all his raigne, death, and ſlaughter never ceaſed till himſelfe was ſlaine, and brought like an hog all bare, on an horſes backe to his grave, in the 3. yeare of his raigne, and about the 40. of his age.
                           19. Henry 7 the next living heire of the houſe of Lancaſter, having vanquiſhed Richard 3. obtained the Crowne, 2485. Aug. 22. maried Elizabeth the heire of the houſe of Yorke, and therby united thoſe two diſtracted houſes. Yet was not his raigne

without troubles. The Crowne being gotten with hazard and much bloud, he was maligned by the Dutches of Burgundy, who ſet up firſt a Lambert, then a Perkin Warbeck, to diſquiet him. Warres he had in France. Inſurrections there were in the North, Rebellions in Cornwall, beſides many grievances which his Subjects complained of. He died in the 24. yeare of his raigne, and 52. of his age.
                           20. Henry 8. ſonne of Henry 7. by a juſt title came to a 1509. Apr. 22. ſetled throne. He that will read Sir Walter Raleighs preface to his hiſtory, ſhall ſee enough (if not too much) of the tronbles of this Kings times. He ended his reigne, and life in the 38. yeare of his raigne, and 56. of his age.
                           21. Edward 6. ſonne of Henry 8. in his childhood came 1546. Ian. 28. to the crowne: yet in his daies the brightneſſe of the Goſpell ſhined forth: but ſo as there wanted not clouds of troubles: The Kingdome being engaged in warre with France and Scotland: the country troubled with inſurrections in Norfolke and Devonſhire: and the Court and Counſell diſtracted into faction: whereby the Kings two uncles, the Lord Protector, and Lord Admirall came to violent deaths: which haſtened, or hindred not, the Kings: and that in the 7. yeare of his raigne, and 17. of his age.
                           22. Mary eldeſt daughter to Henry 8. came with much 1553. Iul. 6. difficulty to the Crowne. Another Queene was firſt proclaimed at London. But that ſtorme laſted not long: for, 9 dayes after at London alſo was Mary proclaimed Queene. As for the continuance of her raigne, ſome may remember, moſt have heard, and all may read how dangerous and dolefull thoſe ſmoaky daies were. Many hundreds were burnt then for the Goſpell ſake; many more were forced to fly their country, and exile themſelves: Callis, that for very many yeares before had appertained to the Engliſh, was loſt: which loſſe is thought to make ſo dead a wound in her heart as it could never be healed. In the laſt period of Queene Maries daies, many impriſoned and adjudged to the fire for the cauſe aforeſaid, were releaſed by her departure out of this world, in the 6. yeare of her raigne, and 43. of her age.
                           
                              
Though God were pleaſed to cauſe the light of his Goſpell to appeare in King Edwards daies, yet for a ſurer ſetling of it, he ſuffers it to be ſealed by the bloud of many worthy Martyrs in Queene Maries daies. Since which time to the immortall glory of God, and the eternall ſalvation of many thouſand ſoules, it hath beene continued among us 63. yeares. So (Lord) let it continue till the comming of thy Sonne unto judgement.
                           By this briefe narration of the troubles of former times, let any indifferent Reader judge, if God have not reſerved us to the beſt times that ever England had: both in regard of the Goſpell of peace, ſo long enjoyed: and alſo in regard of the peace of the land ſo long continued. The benefit wherof followeth next to be declared.
                        
                        
                           §. 96. Of peace and the benefits thereof.
                           
                              
                                 See §. 88.The last concluſion which as a juſt conſequence I inferre from the evills of warre, is this.
                           
                           VI. PEace is a good thing. Warre and Peace are contrary each to other. As many evills ariſe from warre, ſo many benefits from peace. Good therefore it is, as in the kind of it, ſo in the effects that ariſe from it.
                           By peace lands are freely tilled: orchards, gardens, vineyards, and other like fruitfull places tended: all manner of cattell encreaſed: all kind of trading followed: inheritances, and what els of right appertaineth to men, quietly poſſeſſed by the true owners thereof: children well educated: old men well nouriſhed: Schooles and Vniverſities maintained: The Goſpell with free liberty preached: all Gods ordinances obſerved: good lawes duly executed: wrong doers ſuppreſſed: men reſpected according to their places and dignities: opportunity afforded for exerciſing ſuch abilities as God beſtoweth on any: mutuall communion made of ſuch good gifts as God in any kind conferreth on ſeverall perſons: poore men ſet to worke, and relieved: plenty

procured: meanes for ſickneſſe, and all manner of maladies, afforded: decent buriall performed: and many other like benefits obtained: of all which by warre men are very oft ſpoiled, and deprived.
                           Peace is the maine end of juſt and lawfull warre. All the benefits § 17. before noted to ariſe from warre, are enjoyed in peace; and are therefore attributed to war, as effects thereof, becauſe by warre peace is procured, and ſecured. No marvell then that Chriſtians are ſo much called upon, Rom 12. 18. 
                              If it be poſſible, and as much as in them lieth, to have peace with all men. And that Mat. 5. 9. 
                              the peacemakers are pronounced bleſſed. And Pro. 12. 20. 
                              joy is to the counſellours of peace. And it is an uſuall bleſſing to ſay, 1 Sam. 25. 6. 1 Chro. 12. 18. 
                              Peace be to you. Yea Deut. 20 10. Pax &amp; concordia omnibus hominibus amantur, &amp; omnibus hominibus ſunt neceſſariae. Bern de modo benè viv. Serm. 7. God would have peace proclaimed to enemies before they were invaded by warre.
                           Peace is it that is loved of all, and is neceſſary for all.
                           Peace as an eſpeciall bleſſing of God hath in all ages beene promiſed by God to his Church. (Lev. 26. 6. 1 Chro. 22. 9. 2 King. 22. 20. Iſa. 26. 12.)
                           Prophets have thereupon incited Gods people to pray for peace, as for a bleſſing. (Pſal. 122. 6, 7. Ier. 29. 7.) Yea Angels do deſire peace on earth, Luk. 2. 34.
                           Peace according to Gods owne promiſe, and his peoples prayers, hath as a bleſſing beene given them, Iud. 3. 11, 30. 1 King. 4. 24. 2 Chro. 17. 10.
                           Saints have anſwerably been thankfull unto God for peace as for a great bleſſing, Pſal. 29. 11. &amp; 55. 18. &amp; 147. 14. On the contrary, God hath threatned as a judgement to the wicked that they ſhall have no peace, Ier. 12. 1

                           Such is the excellency of peace, as the high and great Lord is ſtiled Rom 15. 33. 
                              the God of peace:

                              King of peace: and Gal. 5. 22. 
                              peace is reckoned up among the fruits of the ſpirit, and Prov. 3. 17. 
                              all the paths of wiſdome are ſaid to be peace, and

                           Finally, peace makes an heaven on earth. In heaven it

Let us therefore put off all further praiſe to that country of peace, where, thorow a more full fruition therof, we ſhalbe enabled more fully to ſet it forth. Only by this that hath been ſpoken of peace, let it be well conſidered how evill warre is, which deprives us of this precious pearle, Peace.
                           
                           What cauſe have we in this reſpect to praiſe God for the proſperous raigne of bleſſed Queene Elizabeth, who by the warres which ſhe had, procured and ſetled this peace: as alſo for the quiet raigne of that great Peace-maker, King Iames, by whom peace was continued to the time of our now royall Soveraigne, King Charles, whom the God and Lord of peace in peace long continue among us, that we and our poſterity may long enjoy peace, and partake of the benefits of peace, particularly of the Goſpell of peace, and thereby be brought unto eternall peace. Amen, Amen.

                           §. 1. Of the meaning of the text.
                           
                              
                                 
                                    Mat. 10. 29,Are not two ſparrowes ſold for a farthing? and one of them ſhall not fall to the ground without your Father. 
                                 
                                    30,But the haires of your head are all numbred.
                                 31.Feare ye not therefore: ye are of more value then many ſparrowes.
                           
                           
                              THE maine Scope of the latter part of this Chapter, from the ſixteenth verſe to the end, is to encourage Chriſts Diſciples in ſpeciall, but in generall, all Chriſtians againſt all that (for their vocation and profeſſion ſake) can by man be done to moleſt or annoy them.
                           
                              
Among other arguments tending to that Scope, one is with much emphaſis preſſed in this text. The argument is taken from Gods Providence: and enforced by the extent of that Providence. In expreſſing hereof every word hath his weight.
                           1. Among Creatures upon which the divine Providence exerciſeth it ſelfe, not the glorious Creatures in heaven, but ſuch as are 
                                 
                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                 . 
                              upon earth, are culled out to give evidence thereof.
                           2. Among creatures on earth, choice is made not of ſuch as are Lords, or beare the divine image in their reaſonable ſoule, but of an unreaſonable creature, a bird.
                           3. Among unreaſonable creatures, is culled out, not the greateſt 
                                 Quis diſpoſuit membra pulicis &amp; culicis ut habeant ordinem ſuum, &amp;c. Aug. Enar. in Pſal. 148. as the whale in the water, the elephant or lion on the earth, the eagle in the aire, but a little bird, a ſparrow.
                           
                           4. Among theſe little birds, the leaſt is mentioned and expreſſed by a 
                                 
                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                           5. The more to manifeſt the meaneneſſe of this creature, the price thereof is ſet downe: which is the leaſt price in uſe, a farthing. Here alſo to amplifie the meanneſſe of this price, a diminutive is uſed, a 
                                 
                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                              little farthing. And as if one little ſparrow alone were not worth any price at all, 
                                 
                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                 . Providentia Dei quin
                                       
                                          
                                       
                                       que
                                     paſſeres qui venduntur dipondio, gubernantur. Hier. Comment. l. 3. in Eph. 5. 
                              two ſparrowes are ſaid to be ſold for one little farthing. Yea, in Luke 12. 6. five of them are ſaid to be bought for two little farthings.
                           
                           6. To declare the divine Providence to extend it ſelfe not onely to the ſeverall kinds of creatures, but alſo to every particular, it is added, 
                                 
                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                 . 
                              not one of them.
                           
                           7. To prove that the moſt caſuall things are ordered by Gods providence, he ſaith not of this little bird, it is fed, or preſerved, but it 
                                 
                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                 . 
                              falleth not, indefinitely. Now there are many wayes whereby little birds fall to the ground. If they be kild they fall downe. When they want meat they fall downe. They fall downe to gather ſtrawes and feathers for their neſts. They oft fall downe on meere caſualty, flying from tree to ground, from buſh to ground, and from other places to the ground, on a kind of wantonneſſe: yet in all

theſe, or any other particulars, this falling downe to the ground is ordered by the divine Providence.
                           
                           8. To ſhew, that yt God which ordereth all the forementioned matters, is the ſame God, who hath ſo far reſpected man, as to give him the greateſt gift that poſſibly he can give to any creature, and whereof any creature can be made partaker, (namely Ieſus Chriſt his onely begotten Sonne, in him to adopt us to be his children, and to provide for us as for his children) he uſeth this note of ſpeciall relation betwixt God and man, 
                                 
                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                 . 
                              your father: implying thereby that he may not, that he cannot be thought to neglect thoſe children of men, whoſe father he is in an eſpeciall manner.
                           9. To amplifie all very emphatically, by an interrogation he propoundeth the point, 
                                 
                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                 . 
                              Are not? &amp;c. whereby he appeales to common experience, and makes even themſelves to be Iudges of the caſe: as if he ſhould ſay, Enquire of any man: yea you your ſelves tell me if it be not ſo and ſo.
                           
                           10. To make us the better to apprehend the ſcope of all Mat. 10. 31. that hath beene ſaid concerning Gods Providence, Chriſt himſelfe makes application thereof to us in verſe 31: and that with an elegant amplification, in theſe words, Ye are of more value then many ſparrowes. He ſaith not ſimply, you are as good; but tranſcendently, more worth. Againe, not many 
                              
                                 
                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                 . of you as good as one ſparrow, or one of you as one ſparrow; but one of you more worth then many ſparrowes. And ſo much 
                                 
                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                 . doth this indefinite phraſe imply, ye are, that is, every one of you is of more value, &amp;c.
                           Hitherto Chriſt hath ſet out one inſtance of the divine Providence, taken from one of the leaſt of unreaſonable creatures. He addeth another inſtance concerning the leaſt of thoſe things which appertaine to man, and that is, his haires.
                           
                           In ſetting downe this he is alſo very emphaticall; for, every word hath his weight.

                           THe Summe of this Text is An incouragement againſt all that man can do.
                           
                           Hereof are two parts 
                                 1. The ground
                                 2. The kind
                              of incouragement.
                           1. The ground is taken from Gods Providence. And it is
                                 1. Propounded, Verſ. 29, 30.
                                 2. Applied, Verſ. 31.
                              
                           
                           Its propounded in two inſtances.
                                 1. The leaſt of creatures in uſe.
                                 2. The leaſt of things appertaining to man.
                              
                           
                           Hence two arguments of incouragement may be drawne from the leſſe, as the ſchooles ſpeake. A minori.
                           
                           The firſt may be thus framed.
                                 That God which hath his providence exerciſed on

ſparrowes, hath it much more excerciſed on Saints. 
                                       Si parva anima

                                 But your God and Father hath his Providence exerciſed over ſparrowes.
                                 Therefore your God and Father hath his Providence much more exerciſed over you.
                                 The propoſition is thus proved.
                                 That God which extendeth his Providence to things of ſmall value, doth much more extend it to you that are of more value.
                                 But your God, &amp;c.
                                 Therefore your God, &amp;c.
                              
                           
                           The ſecond argument taken from the leaſt of things appertaining to man, may be thus framed.
                                 If God by his providence number all your haires, much more your dayes.
                                 But the firſt is true.
                                 Therefore the ſecond.

                           §. 3. Of the extent of Gods Providence.
                           THe Generall point which I inferre from all that hath 
                                 Omnia Dei providentia &amp; iuſtitia gubernantur. Hier. Comment l. 2. in Hierim. 9. Dominus omnia novit, omnia continet, omnia ſua maieſtate diſpenſat. Idem. Comment. l. 12 in Eſa. 41. beene ſaid is this.
                           
                              The divine Providence extendeth it ſelfe to all things.
                           
                           This Generall may well be inferred from the particulars in the text, as hath beene before noted.
                           It may further be proved by that induction of particulars tending to this purpoſe which God himſelfe bringeth in, Iob 38. &amp; 39. &amp; 40. &amp; 41. As alſo by another induction which the Pſalmiſt bringeth in, Pſal. 104. And by that which Chriſt himſelfe mentioneth, Mat. 6. 26, 28 concerning Gods feeding of fowles, and decking of Iillies. Experience gives further evidence hereunto, in that many creatures ſeeke to deſtroy others, and yet none are utterly deſtroyed, but all preſerved. In the ſea the greater fiſh feed on the leſſe, yet are the leſſe exceedingly multiplied. In wilderneſſes

beaſts are a prey one to another, yet the moſt ſilly of them (that are a prey to others) are ſtill continued. Thunders, lightnings, ſtormes, tempeſts, earth-quakes, froſts, droughts, inundations, and other like caſualties oft deſtroy much food which the earth bringeth forth for man and beaſt and are occaſions of many other evills: yet by the divine Providence ſufficient food is preſerved for all creatures, and all the foreſaid evils redreſſed. Naturall men are as wolves, tigres, devils one to another: yet by the divine Providence polities and ſocieties are preſerved.
                           As for things appertaining to Man, in this Text mention is made of haire, in other places it is noted of the very Mat. 5. 36. 
                              colour of haire, and the very Mat. 6. 27. 
                              ſtature of man is ordered by Gods Providence.
                           
                           Seeing the divine Providence extends it ſelfe to ſuch things, what can be imagined whereunto it ſhould not extend?
                        
                        
                           §. 4. Of the ground of the extent of the divine Providence.
                           GOD thus extends his Providence to all things, that he may bring them to ſuch ends as himſelfe hath appointed. Which are in generall, 
                                 1. His owne glory.
                                 2. His childrens good.

                                 . 15.Gods glory is the moſt principall and ſupreme end of all. At that he aimed in his eternall decree, Rom. 9. 23. And in giving the firſt being to his creatures, Prov. 16. 4. At that alſo he aimeth in all things that are done at any time in any place. In which reſpect it is ſaid, that the whole world is full of his glory, Iſa. 6. 3.
                           
                              Ob. Many of the things here below, are ſo meane, and baſe, as they may ſeeme to impeach the divine Majeſty to be buſied about them.
                           
                              Anſw. A reverend Father of our Church giveth this anſwer. There is not the least action or event, which is not overruled
                              
                              and diſpoſed by a Providence: which is ſo farre from detracting ought from the Majesty of God, for that the things are ſmall, as there can be no greater honour to him, then to extend his providence to them becauſe they are infinite. Yea, further the Psal. 113. 5, 6. 
                              Pſalmiſt noteth it as a branch of Gods incomparable glory, to ſtoope ſo low as to order the things on earth.
                           But I would be enformed how it can impeach his glory who made all creatures, even the leaſt and meaneſt that be, to preſerve and governe them by his Providence. Who ſhall order them, if not he that made them?
                           As at the next (but ſubordinate) end, God in his Providence aimeth at his childrens good. In regard hereof, Rom. 8. 28. 
                              All things worke together for their good. Yea God by the hand of his Providence which he hath in all things, turneth the evill purpoſes and practices of men to the good of his children, Gen. 50. 20.
                           If God ſhould not at all meddle with the things here below, ſurely thoſe two fore-named ends, could not be ſo well accompliſhed.
                        
                        
                           §. 5. Of Chance.
                           
                              Such being the extent of Gods providence as hath beene ſhewed, the concluſions following may well be inferred.
                           
                           I. FOrtune is a meere fiction. Fortune, I ſay, as commonly it is taken, in oppoſition to Gods Providence. For,

What fortune or chance is, to take it poſitively as a diſtinct thing that may have a being, none ever could tell. It is a meere fancy, and vaine conceit, or rather a plaine deceit of mans idle braine. Yet

They prepare a table for fortune, beleeving nothing to belong to God, but all things to be ordered either by the courſe of the ſtarres, or by the mutability of fortune. Yea, not onely the

vulgar, but many others alſo among thoſe that profeſſe Chriſtianity, dote too much upon her, and attribute too many things unto her, whereby God is robbed of much honour. I know not any one other thing, whereunto, more of thoſe things which are done by God, are attributed, then to fortune, or chance, or lucke, (for theſe are but ſeverall titles which are uſed to ſet out one and the ſame thing.) Commonly thoſe things which are moſt immediately done by the divine Providence, are aſcribed to Fortune. For, when they ſee not any apparent externall cauſe of a thing, they conceit it to be done by Fortune. How frequent in mens mouths are thoſe phraſes, good luck, ill luck: By good fortune I got this: It was my ill fortune to loſe this. Yea, Chriſtians have learned of Heathen Philoſophers to entitle all the externall good things of this world with this ſtile, goods of Fortune: and ſtill that old diſtinction of good things is retained, Goods of the Mind, (as knowledge, wiſdome, temperance, and all ſorts of ſuch vertues) Goods of the Body (as, Health, ſtrength, beauty, Bona animi, Bona corporis, Bona fortunae. &amp;c.) Goods of Fortune (as, Honour, Wealth, Peace, &amp;c.)
                           The Heathen by this phraſe, Goods of Fortune, implyed that all the things of this world were ordered and diſpoſed by their goodeſſe Fortune.

                              By chance there came downe, &amp;c. and ſeemeth to attribute all thereto, in this phraſe, Eccl. 9. 11.

                              Anſw. Chance or Fortune is taken two wayes, either for a cauſe of it ſelfe, oppoſed to the divine providence, as the Epicures, other Philoſophers, and many of the vulgar take it: So the Philistims uſe it, 1 Sam 6. 9. or els for the hiddenneſſe or ſecrecy of a cauſe; when the cauſe of a thing is ſecret and hidden from us, then it is ſaid to fall out by chance; whereby is meant the ſecret appointment, diſpoſing, and providence of God.

us unawares and unthought of, by reaſon of the obſcurity and ignorance of cauſes.
                           In this latter ſenſe the Holy Ghoſt uſeth the word chance:

Aug. de Bon. Perſev. l. 2. c. 6. whereby it excludes mans projecting or determining this or that, not Gods Providence. To it there is no chance or fortune at all. Thus God is ſaid to deliver him to a mans hand, whom we ſuppoſe to be kild by chance. (compare for this purpoſe Exo. 21, 13. with Deut. 19. 4, 5.) Yea the whole diſpoſition of a lot, is ſaid to be of the Lord, Pro. 16. 33. So as there is nothing done, ſeeme it to us never ſo caſuall, but God either doth it or ſuffereth it to be done. Fortune, as oppoſed hereunto, is a moſt deteſtable idoll.

Enar in Pſal. 188. cont. iſtud delirium. another, do ſtand in moſt need of a divine Providence. And ſurely the divine Providence will moſt manifeſt and exerciſe it ſelfe, where is moſt need thereof. In this reſpect God is ſaid to be A Father of the fatherleſſe, a judge of the widowes, a preſerver of the ſtranger, &amp;c. Pſal. 68. 5. &amp; 1469.
                           This extent of the divine Providence to things here below, I do the rather note, becauſe many Philoſophers, and others alſo have limited and bounded Gods Providence within the circuit of the celeſticall orbes. Such were thoſe whom Eliphaz taxeth, Iob 22. 13, 14.
                           That they may not ſeeme to be mad without reaſon, they give this ground, that in heaven all things are caried with an unalterable courſe and conſtancy, but on earth nothing is done according to order.
                           
                              
                              Anſw. 1. This latter aſſertion, that nothing is done according to order, is moſt falſe.
                           2. The ſeeming diſorder of things here below, is ſo farre from giving evidence againſt the divine Providence about them, as it doth rather ſtrongly evince that Gods Providence reacheth ſo farre. For, notwithſtanding their diſorder, by the divine wiſdome they are brought to good ends. How could all things (being ſo diſordered, yea ſo contrary one to Rom. 8. 28. another) worke together for good to them that love God, were it not that they are ordered and governed by the divine Providence?
                           
                           Let this extent of Providence to theſe inferiour things be the rather noted, that we may thereby be brought to diſcerne the wiſdome of God, to call upon him, to truſt to him, to depend on him, and patiently to expect a good iſſue in all things whatſoever do, or may befall us.
                        
                        
                           §. 7. Of deſpiſing meane things.
                           III. See §. 5. 
                              MEane things are not to be deſpiſed. Nothing whereunto God extendeth his Providence is to be deſpiſed. But we have heard how God extendeth his Providence to the meaneſt things. This is true of unreaſonable creatures. How much more true is, it of reaſonable? which are not onely governed by the divine providence, but alſo created after Gods image, redeemed by the bloud of his Sonne, ſanctified by his Spirit, and reſerved to eternall glory in heaven. That this conſequence of not deſpiſing that wherof God taketh care, is a good and juſt conſequence, is evident by the like, thus inferred by the Apoſtle, Let not him 
                              Rom. 14. 3. 
                              that eateth deſpiſe him that eateth not. For, God hath received him. So as he whom God receiveth, is not to be deſpiſed.
                           On this ground many proud deſpiſers of others are juſtly to be taxed, as,
                           1. Such as the proud Phariſie, who was ſo conceited in Luk. 18. 10, &amp;c his owne righteouſneſſe, as he deſpiſed the humble, contrite, penitent Publicane, who, according to Chriſts owne determination,

                              went down to his houſe justified rather then the other.
                           
                           2. Such hard-hearted and unmercifull men, as the Priest and Levite were, who ſeeing a poore man robbed, ſtripped, Luk. 10. 30, &amp;c wounded, and left halfe dead, paſſed by him (though they ſaw him in that pitifull plight) the one on the one ſide, the other on the other ſide, but affoorded him no ſuccour at all.
                           3. Such as take occaſion from the infirmities of men to abuſe them, and to ſcorne them. The Law giveth two inſtances, inſtead of many, by way of prohibition, thus, Thou ſhalt not curſe the deafe, nor put a ſtumbling blocke before the 
                              Lev. 19. 14. 
                              blind.
                           
                           4. Such ungratious children as mocke their father, and deſpiſe to obey their mother. A fearefull judgement is paſſed Pro. 30. 17. againſt ſuch. The ravens of the vally ſhall plucke out his eye, 
                              Deut. 27. 16. 
                              and the young eagles ſhall eat it. Yea, he that ſetteth light by his father or mother is pronounced accurſed.
                           
                           5. Such undutifull ſervants as take occaſion from their maſters meanneſſe, weakneſſe, age, poverty, or any other infirmity to contemne them. Thus was he in his affliction dealt withall, who ſaid, They that dwell in my houſe, and my maids count me for a ſtranger. I am an alien in their ſight. I 
                              Iob 19. 16, 17. 
                              called my ſervant, and he gave me no anſwer, &amp;c.
                        
                        
                           §. 8. Of Saints not fearing man.
                           IIII. See §. 5. 
                              SAints of God need not feare ſonnes of men. I meane not here by feare that reverend reſpect which inferiours owe to their ſuperiours, who by vertue of their dignity beare the image of God, and in that reſpect are ſtiled Gods, Pſal. 82. 6. and by vertue of their place ſtand in Gods roome. For this is that Honour which the Law requireth, 1 Sam. 8. 7: 
                              Exod. 20. 12. and the Apoſtle adviſeth Chriſtians to yeeld this feare to whom it is due, Rom. 13. 7. But a dread, terrour, or perplexity of mind by reaſon of any evill. The meaning then of the point is this, Saints need not feare any evill that men can do againſt them. This conſequence Chriſt

himſelfe inferreth from the fore-mentioned extent of Gods Providence, Mat. 10. 29, 31. It muſt needs therefore be a juſt conſequence. And to ſhew that it is a matter of moment, worthy of all due regard, he doth here three ſeverall times inculcate it, viz. ver. 26, 28, 31. In many other places of Scripture is feare of men, ſo as here forbidden. In ſpeciall manner note, 1 Pet. 3. 14. where the meaning of this word is thus moſt fully unfolded, 
                                 
                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                 . 
                              Be not afraid of their terrour, neither be troubled. For inſtances take the examples of Heb. 11. 23. 27 
                              Moſes and his parents, of Pſal 118. 6. 
                              David, 
                              Ezr. 8. 22. 
                              Ezra, and the Iewes with him, Neh. 6. 11. of Nehemiah, 
                              Luke 13. 32. 
                              Christ, his Act. 4. 19. Providentiam cateris creatur is non negamus: curam ſponſa vindicat ſibi. Bern. ſuper Cant. Serin. 68. 
                              Apoſtles, and of all Martyrs in all ages.
                           Good grounds there are for Saints to be of undaunted ſpirits. For,
                           1. Gods Providence, extending it ſelfe to the meaneſt creatures (as hath beene proved) it muſt needs be much more exerciſed upon the beſt of creatures, as true Saints are. They are the children of God, the ſpouſe of his Sonne, the temple of his Spirit. They are a peculiar treaſure unto him above all people, though all the earth be his, Exod. 19. 5. Though therefore Gods generall Providence be upon every creature, yet the Spouſe of Chriſt, the Church, and every member of it, every true Saint, challengeth the ſpeciall care of God, as a prerogative to it ſelfe. The Church is Chriſts cure. He hath therefore the greateſt care of it: and it may cast her whole care on him, 1 Pet. 5. 7. and boldly ſay, The Lord is my helper, and I will not feare what man ſhall do unto me, Heb. 13. 6.
                           2. All that man can do, can but Mat. 10. 28. Luk. 12. 4. touch the body: it cannot reach to the ſoule. Now, the body is but the outward part of a man, a mortall part, ſubject to much miſery. Therefore all that man can do at the moſt, is but for a moment, 2 Cor. 4. 17. So as the uttermoſt which man can do, in compariſon of the evill which reacheth to the ſoule, is little to be accounted of, not to be feared.
                           3. Man can inflict nothing upon the body, which may truly and properly be called evill: or which may make it miſerable. Degradation from offices, Deprivation of goods,

Reſtraint of liberty, Reproach, Diſgrace, Torture, Execution of death, Deniall of buriall, and other externall croſſes like unto theſe, are ſo farre from making Saints miſerable, as thorow the divine providence they turne to their advantage. Heb. 10 34. Loſſe of goods may prove a gaine of grace: Act. 16. 25. Reſtraint of outward liberty, a meanes of greater freedome of conſcience: 1 Cor. 4. 13. Diſgrace, a motive for God the more to manifeſt his approbation: Heb. 11. 35. Torment, an occaſion of eaſing the mind: 2 Cor. 4. 17. Death of body, an entrance into eternall life. What evils can they be, which bring ſo great advantages to men?
                           4. If they ſhould be evils, God can protect and deliver from them all. (Of the many wayes of exempting Saints from judgements, ſee The Plaiſter for the Plague, on Num. 16. 45. §. 12, 14.) What cauſe then is there to feare man for any thing he can do?
                           Take to your ſelves therefore, O believers, who are well inſtructed in the extent of Gods providence to all creatures, and thereupon in his care over you, and protection of you, take to your ſelves an holy boldneſſe, and an invincible courage againſt all that man can do. Take to you the reſolutions of them that in truth and faith ſaid, Pſal. 118. 6.
                              The Lord is on my ſide: I will not feare: What can man do unto me? 
                              Dan. 3. 17.
                              Our God whom we ſerve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery fornāce: and he will deliver us. O be not ſo affrighted with ſhadowes, as upon the ſight of painted fire to ſtartle backe into true burning fire. So do they who to avoid perſecution, denie the truth: or to avoid reproach, proove profane. Theſe are no fruits of faith in the extent of Gods Providence.
                           
                        
                        
                           
                           §. 9. Of eying God in all affaires.
                           V. See §. 5. 
                              GOD is to be beheld in all our affaires. If a ſparrow fall not to the ground without him, what do we, what can we do without him? And if his hand be in all that we do or can do, ought we not to take notice thereof, to behold it, well to obſerve it, and marke whereto it tends? Doth God from heaven looke downe upon us on earth, and ſhall not we from earth life up eyes and hearts to him that is in heaven? The Pſalmiſt indefinitely ſaith of all, even Pſal. 145. 15. all creatures, The eyes of all looke up unto thee, O Lord. And ſhall not the eyes of all reaſonable creatures, ſhall not the eyes of all that are made new creatures, looke up unto God? That God which in his ſurpaſſing glory is in heaven, in and by his working Providence, is on earth also; and (as he that well knew what he ſaid, truly ſaid) worketh hitherto, Ioh. 5. 17. He that wrought ſix dayes in creating all things, 
                                 Manifeſtum eſt nequaquam noſtra induſtria, ſed providentia Dei 
                                       •
                                    liam ea perfici, in quibus ipſi videmur operari. Chryſ. in Mat. 6. Hom. 22. worketh to this very day, and ſo will do all the dayes of this world, in and by his Providence. Thus thoſe very things which we our ſelves ſeeme to worke, are more truly effected and perfected by Gods Providence, then by our diligence. Let us therefore enterprize nothing without him. Except the Lord build the houſe, they labour in vaine that build it: except the Lord keepe the city, the watchman waketh but in vaine. It is vaine for you to riſe up early, to ſit up late, to eate the bread of ſorrowes; namely, unleſſe the Lord put to his hand.
                           Learne hereby to commend all thine affaires to the divine Providence. Depend thereon all thy life long. So do on thy death-bed. If thou haſt children, comfort thy ſelfe herein, that though thou (their earthly Father) maiſt be taken from them, yet thine and their heavenly Father, who is not onely a meere ſpectator, and beholder of all things, but a diſpoſer and orderer of them by his wiſe and juſt Providence, ever remaineth to worke with them, to worke for them, if at leaſt they will put their truſt in him, and depend on him. Commend

thy ſoule therefore, commend thy children, and all thou leaveſt behind thee, to his providence, when thou art departing out of this world.
                        
                        
                           §. 10. Of ſubmitting all our purpoſes to Gods will.

                              A mans heart deviſeth his way, that is, a man may with himſelfe plot and purpoſe this and that, But the Lord directeth his ſteps, and bringeth the purpoſes of man 
                                 Quicun
                                       
                                          
                                       
                                       que
                                     hominum greſſus rectum iter incedunt, non ſit hoc libertate humani arbitrij, ſed gubernatione illius, cui dicit Eſaias, Omnia opera no ſtra operatus es nobis. Hier. Comment. l. 2. in Prov 20 Luke 12. 19. to what iſſue God himſelfe pleaſe: according to the proverbe, Man may purpoſe, but God will diſpoſe. So as the good ſucceſſe which men have, comes not from their projecting, nor from any freedome of mans will, but from the guidance of him, to whom the Prophet Iſaiah ſaith, Thou haſt wrought all our workes in us, or for us, Iſa. 26. 12.
                           Iuſtly therefore doth the Apoſtle (Iam. 4. 13, &amp;c.) taxe their bold preſumption, who without thought of God, or of his over-ruling providence, peremptorily ſay, To day or to morrow we will goe into ſuch a city, and continue there a yeare, and buy and ſell, and get gaine, whereas ye know not what ſhalbe on the morrow, &amp;c. This was the proud conceit of him, who by an heavenly voice is called Foole, for ſaying to his ſoule, Soule, thou haſt much goods laid up for many yeares, take thine eaſe, eate, drinke, and be merry. The doome which was denounced againſt him upon that conceit, giveth evidence that he was an egregious foole. It was this, This night thy ſoule ſhall be required of thee: then whoſe ſhall thoſe things be which thou hast provided? Thus we ſee what it is to purpoſe or promiſe any thing without the Lord.
                           On the contrary, they queſtionleſſe were well inſtructed in this all-ruling, and over-ruling Providence of God, who in all their purpoſes had ever a reſervation to God, as he that ſaid, 1 Chro 13. 2. 
                              If it be of the Lord let us ſend abroad, &amp;c. and he alſo that ſaid, 1 Cor. 4. 19. 
                              I will come to you ſhortly if the Lord will. And

againe, Act. 18. 21. 
                              I will returne to you againe, if God will. St. Iames where he taxed the fore-mentioned profane and overperemptory ſpeeches, giveth this direction for ſubmitting our purpoſes to the divine Providence, Ye ought to ſay, if the Lord will, we ſhall live, and do this or that. This is not to be taken, as if we ſhould to every ſentence that we utter adde this clauſe, If God will, but that we ſhould be ſo well inſtructed in the divine Providence, as to know nothing can be done without the will of God, and thereupon ever to have in our minds that reſervation, If the Lord will. Thus by ſubmitting our wills to Gods will, we ſhalbe ſure both to have our wills effected, yea alſo that to be effected, which is the beſt. Gods will, will we, nill we, ſhalbe accompliſhed. If then we will nothing, but that which may ſtand with Gods will, in the effecting of Gods will, our will muſt needs be effected. And becauſe Gods will ordereth and diſpoſeth all things to the beſt, on the ſame ground, that which we will muſt needs fall out to the beſt. But ſuppoſe our will ſhould wiſh any thing that God would not have: what skilleth it? We may know what we would have: but God knoweth what we ſhould, and ſhall have. It is therefore much better that our purpoſe and deſire be croſſed, if at leaſt it be contrary to Gods, then effected. If Gods counſell and determination be accompliſhed (as accompliſhed it ſhalbe) it is enough. My will therefore ſhall take the pattern of our Saviours for her guide, and in all caſes ſay as he did in a moſt extreme caſe, O my Father, not as I will, but as thou wilt, Mat. 26. 39.
                           O how impious, ſacrilegious, and blaſphemous, yea, atheiſticall and Luciferian was that ſpeech of a Pope, who being forbid by his Phyſitian a meat that he liked, replied, that Iulius 3. he would have it in deſpite of God. Such are the thoughts (if not the ſpeeches) of many preſumptuous ſpirits.

                              COntentedneſſe is requiſite in all eſtates. The extent of Gods Providence giving evidence to Gods diſpoſing and ordering all eſtates, if men reſt not content in their eſtate, they manifeſt a diſcontent at his Providence. Surely he had an eye on Gods Providence ordering his eſtate, who in his great affliction ſaid, Pſal. 39 9. 
                              I was dumbe and opened not my mouth, becauſe thou (Lord) diaſt it. And he, who having heard a judgement denounced againſt him, which would make a mans eare to tingle againe, replied, 1 Sam. 3. 18. 
                              It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good. In like manner, 2 Sam. 15. 26.—16. 11.

                              Hezekiah, and others, manifeſted great contentednes in great extremities. But moſt pertinent to our purpoſe is this of S. Paul, 
                              Phil. 4 11, 12. 
                              I have learned in whatſoever ſtate I am therewith to be content. I know both how to be abaſed, and I know how to abound: every where, and in all things I am inſtructed both to be full and to be hungry: both to abound and to ſuffer need. 
                              1 Tim. 6. 10. Heb. 13 5. To this contentedneſſe we are all exhorted by him that had ſo well learned it himſelfe.
                           Well it beſeemeth the ſonnes of God, children that have ſo high and heavenly, ſo potent, ſo prudent, ſo provident a Father, whoſe Providence extends it ſelfe, as to all creatures not the leaſt excepted, ſo to every thing that appertaineth to them (ſeeme it never ſo ſmall, as to their haire, the number and colour thereof, and to the juſt pitch of their ſtature) well (I ſay) it beſeemeth children that have ſuch a Father, to reſt contented with that eſtate wherein he ſetteth them. Whatſoever the preſent eſtate of Saints is, God hath ſet them therein. On this ground, as when we are in high and honourable places, when we abound in wealth, when we have good health, when we enjoy peace, or any manner of proſperity, we ought to be perſwaded that theſe are good for us: ſo on the other ſide, when we are in meane places, when we are pinched with poverty, when we are viſited with ſickneſſe, when we are moleſted with ſundry troubles, when

we are preſſed with all manner of adverſity, to be perſwaded that even theſe latter eſtates are beſt for us, at that time when, and ſo long as we are in them. For our eſtate, of what kind or condition ſoever it be, is diſpoſed by our Father before mentioned; and he knoweth what is fitter for us, then we can know. Therfore the Lord here in this text, ſpeaking of the extent of the divine Providence, putteth them in mind of this Father, ſaying, A ſparrow ſhall not fall to the ground without YOVR FATHER. Faith herein will make us thankfull for all manner of proſperity, as proportioned out unto us in wiſdome and love by this our Father: and patient under all manner of adverſity, as laid upon us in like wiſdome and love by the very ſame Father. This is rightly and truly to be

                           §. 13. Of aſcribing the glory of all deliverances to God.
                           VIII. See §. 5. 
                              THe glory of all deliverances is to be aſcribed to God. For by that Providence which extends it ſelfe to all things, deliverances from enemies, from dangers, from diſtreſſes, from all manner of evils, are obtained. But that is the Providence of God. To whom then, if not to him ſhall the glory thereof be aſcribed? Hereof we have ſpoken 
                                 The Churches Conqueſt, on Exo. 17. 15. §. 77. before.
                           Onely here learne we to apply this generall point, to ſuch particular deliverances as God hath given unto us. Conſidering therefore that this our land, which hath now for many yeares enjoyed the bright, pure, comforting, ſanctifying, and ſaving light of the Goſpell, lay for many hundred yeares together in the diſmall and damnable darkneſſe of Popery, we are oft to call to mind, and duly to meditate on the means and times whereby and wherein the divine providence hath brought into our land, this light, to diſcover and drive away that (worſe then Egyptian) darkneſſe of Popery. For inſtances take theſe.
                           
                              
1. Iohn Wickliffe about the yeare 1371 in the raigne of Edward 3. even in the midſt of popiſh darkneſſe, held out the light of the Goſpell, wherewith many in thoſe dayes were enlightned. This fire, by the abundance of aſhes which the Romiſh Clergy heaped upon it, lay, after the death of Iohn Wickliffe, ſmothered up: yet were thoſe aſhes raked away, about 40 yeares after by Iohn Hus, and the ſparkes of that fire ſo blowne up, as dazled the eyes of the Papiſts, and made them mad againe, againſt thoſe that laboured to bring out thoſe ſparks.
                           2. Henry 8. diſanulling the Popes uſurped authority in England, had by Act of Parliament, the title of Supreme 
                              An. Dom. 1534 
                              Head of the Church in his owne dominions, conferred upon him, and liberty given him to reforme abuſes crept into the Church. Thereupon he made Articles, and ſent out injunctions for removing images, reading Divine Service and the Holy Scriptures in Engliſh, preaching Gods Word, catechiſing children, and performing other duties of piety, ſo as the Goſpell began to ſhine forth ſomwhat brightly in England, till about ſix yeares after thorow the ſix articles eſtabliſhed An. Dom. 1540 by Act of Parliament, a cloud was gathered before that bright light. That Act for eſtabliſhing the ſix articles, was among the common ſort ſtiled the Scourge with ſix ſtrings. For many were therewith ſcourged to death. The heads of thoſe ſix Articles were theſe.
                           
                              1. Tranſubſtantiation eſtabliſhed.
                              2. Communion in both kinds excluded.
                              3. Prieſts mariage prohibited.
                              4. Vowes of chaſtity warranted.
                              5. Private Maſſes allowed.
                              6. Auricular Conſeſſion justified.
                           
                           3. Edward the 6. comming to the Crowne, diſpelled the cloud of thoſe ſix Articles, yea and from the miſt of other popiſh remainders, ſo as in his time the Goſpell ſhined out in her full brightneſſe. But yet about ſix yeares after, by his death a thicker and darker cloud, then was in the daies of Henry 8. gathered together in Queene Maries daies, and

over-ſhadowed the whole Land. Then inſtead of the heavenly light of the Goſpell, an helliſh light of burning fire brake out to the deſtruction of many.
                           4. Queene Elizabeth by re-eſtabliſhing the Goſpell, as it An. Dom. 1558 were by the brightneſſe of the ſun, put out the fore-mentioned fire, and ſo ſetled the Goſpell of peace in this land, as now 73 yeares we have enjoyed with it, much externall peace.
                           Theſe have beene very ſpeciall deliverances, which have apparantly beene wrought by the divine Providence. They ought oft to be thought on: that our hearts may be the more inflamed to give the glory of them to God.
                           To theſe might be added many other evidences of Gods Providence, in preſerving the foreſaid Queene Elizabeth from many plots and treaſons againſt her Perſon and life; as alſo in preſerving our late King Iames of bleſſed memory, and our now royall Soveraigne. But the heads of theſe have beene diſtinctly ſet downe before, §. 93. 94.

                           IX. See § 5. 
                              THe glory of judgements on the Churches enemies is to be aſcribed to God. For, by the fore-mentioned Providence are they executed. He is the God of vengeance. Hereof we have ſpoken 
                                 Churches Conqueſt, on Exo. 17. 14 §. 66, 69. before.
                           Onely here I ſuppoſe it to be moſt meet to make a particular and true narration of that judgement which The Downefall was Oct. 26. 1623. This preached 5. Nov. next following. ten daies ago befell the Papiſts in this pariſh: whereof there are many uncertaine reports ſpread abroad.
                        
                        
                           
                           §. 15. Of a downe-fall of Papiſts.
                           
                              An Dom 1623
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       I Do the more confidently publiſh this history, becauſe I was an eye-witneſſe of many of the things therein related, and heard, from the mouth of ſuch as were preſent at the ſermon, the other things. For, upon the first hearing of the destruction of ſo many perſons as by that Downe-fall lost their lives, our Conſtables forthwith cauſed the gates of our Precinct (it being encloſed about with walls and gates) to be ſhut, and raiſed a ſtrong guard from among the Inhabitants, to keepe the houſe where this accident fell out, and to prevent tumult about it. Thus thorow the favour of the Conſtables and Watch, who were all my neighbours, I had the more free and quiet acceſſe, to view the dead bodies, and to enſorme myſelfe in all the materiall circumſtances of that accident: and that I did ſomuch the rather, becauſe the Biſhop of London (that then was) ſēt to me to inform my ſelf thorowly of the whole buſineſſe, and ſend him a narration thereof under my hand: whereupon I did not onely

view matters my ſelfe, but cauſed Carpenters to ſearch the timber, to take the ſcantlings thereof, and to meaſure the roomes. I was alſo preſent with the Coroner, and his Inqueſt, at their examining of all circumſtances about the buſineſſe. And where my Lords Grace of Canterbury ſent to me, to come to him, and to bring with me the best evidence I could, I got the Foreman and others of the Iury, and four perſons that were preſent at the ſermon, and fell downe with the multitude, but by Gods providence eſcaped death, and one that ſtood without the doore in hearing, but fell not: all theſe I got to go with me to Lambith, where I heard the witneſſe which they gave to my Lords Grace about the matter. One that fell with the reſt and eſcaped death, was Mr. Gee, a Preacher, of Lankaſhire: two other were a ſonne and ſervant of a Citizen in Pater-noſter Row. The other alſo were men of good understanding, able to conceive what they ſaw and heard, and to relate what they conceived.
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              ON the Lords Day, being the 26. of Oct. (as we in England, according to the ancient account of moneths and dayes in Christendome, doe reckon the time) but the 5. of Nov. (as the late Gregorian account reckons it.) The occaſion of the great concourſe.On that day a common report went up and downe, farre and neare, that one Drurie, a Romiſh Prieſt would preach in the afternoone, in a faire houſe in Black-Friers London, whither they that would, might freely come to heare him.
                           Vpon this Rumour (fame alſo ſetting an high commendation on the excellency of the mans parts, and eminency of his gifts) very many, Proteſtants as well as Papiſts, Schollers as well as others, aſſembled thither about three of the clocke in the after-noone.
                           
                              A Deſcription of the place.The roome where they were aſſembled was a long garret, the uppermoſt ſtory of an high edifice, built with ſtone and bricke.
                           The maine manſion houſe was inhabited by the

                              French Ambaſſadour.
                           
                           To the foreſaid garret there were two paſſages. One out of the Ambaſſadours with-drawing chamber, which was private. The other more common, without the great gate of the ſaid manſion houſe.
                           Vnder the garret was a great ſquare chamber, which one Redyate another Popiſh Prieſt had hired for himſelfe. Whereunto Papiſts much reſorted, to make confeſſion, and heare maſſe.
                           Vnder that, the fore-ſaid with-drawing chamber of the French Ambaſſadour. And this with-drawing chamber was ſupported with arches of ſtone: being immediately over the entrance into the great houſe.
                           At the South end of the garret, and on the Weſt ſide thereof, there were bedchambers and cloſets which other Prieſts had hired.
                           The bed-chamber at the South end was ſevered from the other part of the garret only by a partition of Wanſcote, which was taken down for the Sermon-time. The length of the garret from North to South was almoſt 40 foot. The bredth but 16

foot. For, it was within the roofe: and ſo gathered in narrower then the roome below it: which was about 20 foot ſquare.
                           The two fore-mentioned paſſages met on one paire of ſtairs leading to the ſaid garret, which had one onely doore entring into it.
                           
                              The great concourſe of people.More came to this place, then poſſibly it could hold, ſo as many could not get in, but returned backe againe. Others went into the foreſaid Redyats chamber, and taried with him. The whole garret, roomes adjoyning, doore, and top of ſtaires were as full as could be.
                           In the garret were ſet ſome ſtooles, and chaires for the better ſort. Moſt of the women ſate on the floore, but moſt The preparation made. of the men ſtood thronged together. About two hundred are ſuppoſed to be there aſſembled. About the middeſt of the roome was a chaire and a little table before it for the Preacher.
                           All things thus prepared, and the multitude aſſembled, The Preachers manner of entrance. about three a clock the expected Preacher, having a ſurplice on him girt about his middle with a linnen girdle, and a tippet of ſcatlet on both his ſhoulders, came in, being attended upon by a man carying in one hand a booke, and in the other an houre-glaſſe.
                           So ſoone as he came to the table prepared for him, he kneeled downe, with ſhew of private devotion a little while. Then riſing up, and turning himſelfe to the people, he croſſed himſelfe, and tooke the foreſaid booke (which was ſaid to be the Rhemiſh Testament) out of the hand of the man that followed him: and the houre-glaſſe being ſet upon the table, he opened the booke, and read the Goſpell appointed (according to the direction of the Romiſh Calender) The Text. for the 21 Sunday after Pentecoſt, as that was. That Goſpell is recorded by St. Matthew, chap. 18. 23, &amp;c. The text being read, he ſate downe in his chaire, and put on his head a red cap, over a white linnen one turned up about the brimmes.
                           He made no audible prayer at all: but having read his

text, he firſt ſpake ſomthing of the occaſion of it (it being the Parable of forgiving debts:) and then propounded three eſpeciall points to be handled out of it.The principall points handled.
                              
                                 1. The debt we owe to God. 
                                 2. The mercy of God in forgiving it.
                                 3. Mans unmercifulneſſe to his brother.
                              
                           
                           Having inſiſted ſome while on the miſery of man by reaſon of the debt wherein he ſtands bound to God; he paſſed on to declare the rich mercy of God, and the meanes which God had afforded to his Church for partaking thereof. Among theſe he reckoned up the Sacraments, and eſpecially preſſed the Sacrament of Penance, as they call it.
                           He was diſcourſing on theſe points about halfe an houre, when on a ſudden the floore whereon the preacher and the The diſmall fall. greater part of his Auditory ſtood, fell downe with ſuch violence, as therewith the floore of the chamber under it (where Redyate before mentioned and ſome company with him, were) was borne downe: ſo as both the floores, the beames, girders, joyces, boards and ſeelings, with all the people on them, fell downe together upon a third floore, which was the floore of the French Ambaſſadours withdrawing chamber, ſupported with ſtone arches, as aforeſaid.
                           Here by the way, the Providence of God in the preſervation of the Ambaſſadour, is remarkable. This with-drawing The Ambaſſadour abſent. chamber was next to his bed-chamber. He had oft recourſe thither. It was ſaid by his Attendants that that very afternoone. he was in that withdrawing chamber: and that not long before the ſermon he came out of it to go to the Court.
                           There being a partition on the South ſide of the middle chamber which reached up to the floore of the garret, and How many of the Auditory fell not. ſupported it, that part of the garret which was beyond that partition South-ward, fell not: ſo as all the people thereon were ſafe. Onely they had no way to get out. For, there was but one entrance into the garret, which was at the North-West corner. Hereupon ſome thorow amazement

would have leaped out of a window, almoſt forty foot from the ground. But the people without told them of the danger if they leapt downe, and ſo kept them from that deſperate attempt. At length by breaking the wall on the Weſt ſide, they diſcerned chambers adjoyning thereto: and thorow the hole which they made, they crept into thoſe chambers, and were ſaved.
                           All that ſtood on the ſtaire-head at the doore leading into the garret, were alſo ſaved. For, the ſtaires were without the roome, and nothing fell but the floores: nor walls, nor roofe.
                           Among thoſe that fell, many eſcaped: for, ſome of the Who fell, but eſcaped death. peeces of timber reſting with one end on the wall, and with another on the third floore that yeelded not, both ſuch as abode upon thoſe peeces, and ſuch as were under them, were thereby preſerved. A Miniſter that was there and fell with He himſelfe told me this ſtory. the multitude, thorow the providence of God fell ſo betwixt two pecces of timber, as that timber kept his upper parts from cruſhing, and helpt him, by his claſping about the timber, to pull out his feet from among the dead corps.
                           Among others the preſent preſervation and future deſtruction of Parker is very remarkable. This Parker was a One that eſcaped death in the fall, ſhortly after drowned. kind of factor for Engliſh Seminaries and Nunnes beyond ſea, eſpecially at Cambre. He ſo dealt with two brothers of his in England, as he obtained of one a ſonne of his, and of another a daughter, to ſend them to religious houſes (as thoſe ſuperſtitions places are called) beyond Sea. This Parker tooke his Nephew, a youth of 16 yeares age, to the fore-mentioned fatall conventicle, where Drury preached. Both theſe, Parker and his Nephew fell with the reſt. The youth there loſt his life, but Parker himſelfe eſcaped with a bruiſed body, being a corpulent man. So farre was he from praiſing God, as with much diſcontent he wiſhed that he had died for his Nephew, and ſaid, that God ſaw not him ſit to die among ſuch Martyrs. Strange Martyrs! Yet not ſo ſtrange, as thoſe martyrs which died under gallowſes and

gibbets for treaſon. Such are Romes martyrs. But about ten days after this Parker ſhooting London bridge with his foreſaid Neece, whom he was conveighing over Sea, both were caſt away in the Thames. Iudge hereby (O Parents) whether God be well pleaſed with committing your children to Papiſts for education.
                           But to returne to our ſtory.
                           Others there were, that were pulled out alive, but ſo bruiſed, or ſo ſpent for want of breath, as they died within few houres after, others within few daies after.
                           The floore of the chamber immediately over this, where Cauſes of their death. the dead corpſes lay, being fallen, there was no entrance hereunto, but thorow the Ambaſſadours bed-chamber: the doore whereof was cloſed up by the timber of the floores that fell downe. The wals of this roome were ſtone: onely one window therein, with extraordinary croſſe iron barres. Thus, though Smiths and other workemen were ſent for, yet it was more then an houre before ſuccour could be afforded unto them.
                           When paſſage was made for others, I had acceſſe into the roome, and viewing the bodies, obſerved ſome (yet but few) to be mortally wounded or bruiſed with the timber; others to be apparently ſtifled, partly with their thick lying one on another, and partly with the duſt that came from the ſeeling that fell.
                           On the Lords Day night when they fell, there were numbred The number flaine. 91 dead bodies: whereof many of them were ſecretly conveighed away that very night. For, there were a paire of water ſtairs leading out of the garden, appertaining to that houſe, into the Thames.
                           
                           On the morrow following the Coroner and his Inquest comming to view the bodies, found remaining but 63.
                           Of thoſe that were caried away, ſome were buried in a Their buriall. burying place within the Spaniſh Ambaſſadours houſe in Holborn, among whom the Lady Webb was one, the Lady Blackstones daughter another, and one Miſtris Vdall a third. Maſter Stoker and Maſter Bartholomew Bavine were buried

in S. Brides pariſh. Robert Sutton, Iohn Loccham, and Abigail Holford in S. Andrewes Holborne; Captaine Summers wife in the vault under Black-Friers Church, and her woman in the Church-yard.
                           
                           For the Corpſes remaining two great pits were digged, one in the fore-court of the ſaid French Ambaſſadours houſe, 18 foot long, and 12 foot broad, the other in the garden behind his houſe, 12 foot long, 8. foot broad: In the former pit were laid 44 corpſes, whereof the bodies of the forenamed Redyat and Drury were two. Theſe two wound up in ſheets were firſt laid into the pit: and a partition of looſe earth to ſever them from the reſt. Then were others brought: ſome in ſomwhat a decent manner, wound up in ſheets: but others in a more lamentable plight, the ſhirts onely of the men tied under their twiſt: and ſome linnentied about the middle of the women: the other parts of their body naked: one poore man or woman taking a corpſe by the head, another by the feet: and ſo piled them up almoſt to the top of the pit.
                           The remainder were put into the other pit in the garden.
                           Their manner of buriall ſeemed almoſt (if not altogether) as diſmall, as the heape of them when they lay on the floore whereupon they laſt fell.
                           No obſequies or funerall rites were uſed at their buriall. Onely on the day after, a blacke croſſe of wood was ſet upon each grave. But ſoone was it by authority commanded to be taken downe.
                           Thus they being interred, thorow ſearch was made about the cauſe of the failing of the timber. The timber of The ſcantling of the timber that brake. each floore was laid together: and the meaſure of the Summiers that brake, taken.
                           The maine Summier which croſſed the garret was ten inches ſquare. Two girders were by tenents and mortaiſes let into the midſt of it, one juſt againſt another. The Summier was knotty where the mortaiſes were made: whereupon being over-burdened, it knapt ſuddenly aſunder in the midſt
                           
                              
The maine Summier of the other floore that fell was much ſtronger, being 13 inches ſquare, ſmooth and ſound every where, no knot in it: neither did the girders meet ſo juſt one againſt another. Yet that alſo failed: not in the middeſt, as the uppermoſt, but within five foot of one end, and that more ſhiveringly, and with a longer rent in the timber, then the other. For, this chamber was almoſt full with ſuch perſons as comming too late to get into the ſermon, went into Redyats chamber. Beſides, it did not only beare the weight which lay on the upper floore, together with the weight of that floore that fell, but alſo received all that weight with a ſudden knock; and ſo the maſſy timber ſhivered in two, as ſuddenly as the other knapped aſunder, and the people were irrecoverably downe (before they could feare any ſuch thing) on the third floore, which was above 20 foot from the firſt.
                           If this be not an evidence of the eye and hand of the divine Providence, both ſeeing and ordering things below, what evidence can be given thereof?
                           True is that of the Wiſeman, All things come alike to all. 
                              Eccl 9. 2. 
                              There is one event to the righteous and to the wicked, &amp;c. There is nothing that befalleth any one, but may befall every one. And even ſuch an accident may befall an aſſembly of true worſhippers of God, as either the floore to fall under them, or the roofe and walls to fall upon them. For,
                           1. The judgements of God are unſearchable, and his wayes paſt finding out, Rom. 11. 33.
                           2. He hath other meanes to put difference betwixt his Saints and others, then externall events.
                           3. He will have his to feare alwaies, (Prov. 28. 14.) and alwaies to depend on him.
                           Yet notwithſtanding where we ſee judgements executed on ſinners when they are in their ſinne, when they are impudent and preſumptuous therein, not to acknowledge ſuch to be judged of the Lord, is to winke againſt a cleare light. Pſal 9. 16. 
                              God is knowne by the judgement which he executeth. To ſuppoſe then that the judgement which he executeth is

no judgement, is to put out that light which he affordeth of making knowne himſelf. Dan 4. 3 c, &amp;c Shall Nebuchadnezzar while he is vaunting of his great Babylon, be bereft of his wits? Act. 12. 22, &amp;c. Shall Herod while he is priding himſelfe in the peoples flattering applauſe, be eaten of wormes? 
                              Heſt. 3. 8.—5. 14.—6. 4.—7. 10. Shall Haman while he is practicing to deſtroy all the people of God, and intending to hang Mordecai on a gallowes of 50 foot high, be hanged thereon himſelfe? 2 King. 19. 37 Shall Sennacherib while he is worſhipping in the houſe of Niſroch his god, be ſlaine by his owne ſonnes? Iudg. 16. 30. Shall the houſe where the Philiſtines met to make ſport with Sampſon, fall upon their heads? Shall theſe and ſuch like judgements overtake men in the very act of their ſinning, and yet be accounted no judgements, no evidences of the divine providence, no ſignes of his indignation? Then let all things be ordered by chance: or rather let there be no order at all.
                           For the Conventicle where the fore-mentioned Downefall was, It was for the greater part of Papiſts, who are palpable idolaters, whoſe doctrine is a maſſe of ancient hereſies, who are by Law interdicted the execution of miniſteriall functions, who at this time gave outbefore hand that ſuch a prieſt ſhould preach, who made choice of a ſpacious place, who let the doore be open for all commers, who taking advantage at ſome preſent connivence, moſt audaciouſly and impudently, without feare of God or man did what they did. Now for ſuch, in ſuch an act, after ſuch a manner done, ſo many of them, by ſuch a meanes to be taken away, what can be ſaid or thought, but that This is the finger of God. For to end as I began, Are not two ſparrowes ſold for a farthing? And one of them ſhall not fall on the ground without your Father. But the very haires of your head are numbred.

                           AS by a free Election of you all, I was called to preach that which is here preſented to you, ſo by the first motion and earnest ſollicitation of many of you, I am induced to publiſh it. How farre mine owne purpoſe was from any ſuch purpoſe, God is my witneſſe. How farre your deſire prevailed to alter that my purpoſe, this evidence is an apparent evidence. Among other motives mentioned by you that in

the name of the rest were Solliciter in this buſineſſe, this, which by ſome of you was alleaged, moſt prevailed with me, that the more common this Sermon was made, the more commodious it might be to your Company. How my poore paines may adde any advantage to your important imployments, I know not. This I know, and do openly acknowledge, and publikely profeſſe, that my heart is ſet upon your Artillery Company: I love it: I admire it: I honour it: I praiſe God for it: I will continue to pray to the Lord of Hoſts for his bleſsing upon it: and to my poore power, I will doe what I can, for the advancement thereof. As one, though a very meane and weake proofe thereof, I doe here dedicate to you in particular, that which by your meanes, and for your ſake is divulged to all in generall. I confeſſe, that as the matter thereof, ſo the manner of handling it, is ſomewhat differing from my ordinary courſe. For, I had reſpect to the kind of Auditory before which I ſpake. Among Souldiers I endeavoured to ſpeake Souldier-like. If offence be taken at matter or manner, I ſhroud my ſelfe under your ſhields for defence. Now that you have brought me forth into the open field, and ſet me up to be gazed on, and baited at by the differing cenſures of diverſe cenſors, leave me not to ſhift for my ſelfe. Be not backward to patronize what you have beene forward to produce. I may the rather expect all juſt defence from you, becauſe by appearing ſomewhat otherwiſe in your Aſſembly then I uſe to doe in my uſuall Auditory, I take you, worthy Preſident for my preſident, yea all you valiant Captaines, and other Gentlemen, whom I make as one Patrone, for my patterne herein. Me thinkes, O prudent Preſident, when in a forenoone I ſee you ſitting, and giving advice among the

wiſe Senators of our City, and in an afternoone marching before the Martiall Gentlemen of your Company, me thinkes the ſame man is not the ſame man. But of old, ſuch hath beene the demeanour of thoſe who have beene gifted for the one and the other place, to be both grave Senators and brave Souldiers. Such were Brutus, Scipio the one and the other, Camillus, Marius, Pompey, Caeſar, and many other who were both Togati and Armati, prudent Conſuls, potent Captaines. The like I may ſay of all you Gentlemen of the Artillery Garden: You that are, whereſoever you are, in your perſons the ſame Perſons, do with that decorum obſerve the buſineſſe which you are about, as in your ordinary vocation, and Military profeſsion, you ſeeme to be other and other men. Hereby you manifeſt your prudence and providence. Prudence, by fitting your ſelves to that which is fit for the preſent. Providence, both by improving the time of peace, and making the beſt advantage thereof in the duties of your particular callings, and alſo by preparing your ſelves againſt the time of Warre, and preventing the damage which might otherwiſe thence enſue.

A quin. 2 2. quaeſt. 40. Ar tic. 2.So well have I ever approved this your courſe, as, if my coate and calling had beene anſwera ble, long ere this, I had endeavoured to have beene of your Artillery Company. But, for thoſe whoſe education appertaineth to me, I verily purpoſe, and openly profeſſe, that if ever any Sonne of mine be a Citizen of London, and of ſufficient ability, I will endeavour to have him a member of this your Company. Of which minde, I would more perſons and parents were. If they were, and their childrens mind (when they are of age) anſwerable therto, both City and Kingdome would be much more honoured and ſecured by this and other like Societies. My deſire is therfore,

that this which is likely to come to the view of many more then at firſt heard it, may prevaile with thoſe many, to doc as you doe, and to adde able men and availeable meanes to the advancement of your Company. To conclude, if any advancement (O noble Preſident, Captaines, and Gentlemen of the Artillery Company) may any way by your deſire to have that, which once your ſelves heard, lie open to the view of all, be attained, the end of yeelding to your deſire is obtained. For this end therefore, humble and hearty prayer is and ſhall be made (to him that hath power to move the minds of all men according to his owne mind) by him that promiſeth to be

                        THE DIGNITIE OF CHIVALRY, Set forth in A SERMON, Preached before the Artillery Company of LONDON, 13. Iune. MDCXXVI.
                        
                           §. 1. Of the Summe of Text and Sermon.

                                 THEY were MEN of WARRE.
                              
                           
                           
                              THE Dignity of Chivalry (a point very pertinent for this preſent appointment) is the Pearle that is incloſed in the casket of my Text. Hereof that you may take the better view, I will ſet open this casket in your ſight. Be pleaſed therefore to take notice of the generall Scope whereat the Holy Ghoſt aimeth in this Chapter:

thereby you may diſcerne that the forenamed point, The Dignity of Chivalry, is not violently wreſted, but properly ariſeth out of my Text. The Summe of this Chapter is A Declaration of the Magnificence of Salomon. Among other evidences thereof this is one, that his native Subjects, Children of Iſrael, THEY were MEN of WARRE. The originall expreſſeth none but words of weight: Circumſtantiall words, which are as bonds to knit word to word, it leaveth to be underſtood. There are therefore three onely words in the originall, all which ſet out the Dignity of Chivalry, and that by the Perſons, their Property, and Part whereunto they were put.

                                 The ſecond, 
                                       〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                     MEN, a Speciall Property.
                                 
                                 The third, 
                                       〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                     WARRE, a Select imployment.
                                 
                              
                           
                           THEY were MEN of WARRE.
                        
                        
                           §. 2. Of ſuch as are fit or unfit for warre.
                           IN the two verſes before my Text, it is ſaid, that there were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizites, and the Hivites, and the Iebuſites, who were not of Iſrael: 
                              2 Chro. 8. 7, 8. and that being left, they were ſo brought under, as Salomon made them to pay tribute. They might therefore have beene put to any office or worke that the King would: yet were not THEY MEN of WARRE. They were too meane and unmeet perſons, for a function ſo high and honourable. On Who not fit for Warre. the contrary, in the words immediately before my Text, it is ſaid, Of the children of Iſrael, did Salomon make no ſervants for his worke. They being men of better note and name, were 2 Chron. 8. 9. reſerved for a more honourable imployment, which my Text thus expreſſeth, THEY were MEN of WARRE; which words are inferred on the former, by way of oppoſition, with this adverſative Particle BVT. They were no ſervants for worke: BVT THEY were MEN of WARRE. As the meaner and baſer ſort were made ſervants for worke, ſo Who fit for Warre. the better and excellenter ſort were made Souldiers for War.
                              
THEY were MEN of WARRE. Nor Hittites, nor Amorites, nor Perizites, nor Hivites, nor Iebuſites, BVT Iſraelites, THEY were MEN of WARRE. No Slaves, no Captives, no Aliens, no Forrainers, but Free-men, Freeborne, Native Subjects, Naturall Citizens, THEY were MEN of WARRE. Thus this relative particle 
                                 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                               THEY, as here it is uſed, is to be taken

                              with an excellency, as importing ſome eminency of the Perſons here meant. This choice then of Perſons maketh much to the Dignity of Chivalry.
                           
                        
                        
                           §. 3. Of the property of men of Warre.
                           2. AS there was choice made of perſons in regard of their outward priviledge, Iſraelites, Natives, Citizens:

                               MEN, though it be oft uſed for mortal men, ſubject to many miſeries, yet is it alſo put for

                              valorous men, and attributed to thoſe choice men which were taken out of the twelve ſeverall Tribes of Iſrael, and ſent to ſpie the Land of Canaan. Yea, this very word Numb. 13. 2, 3. is twice uſed in that exhortation which the Philiſtims uſe to encourage one another, when they heard that the Arke of the LORD was brought into the hoſt of the Iſraelites: and it is uſed to ſet out valour and courage in men. For thus, word for word it may be tranſlated, Be men: ſome tranſlate it thus, Play the MEN: Others thus, Quit you

Our Engliſh is herein penurious, it wanteth fit words to expreſſe this difference: We call all, whether mighty or meane, Men: yet ſometimes this word MEN in our tongue hath his Emphaſis, as in theſe and ſuch like phraſes, They have played the MEN. They have ſhewed themſelves MEN. They are MEN indeed. Thus in the Engliſh tranſlation of the Scripture it is uſed, I Cor. 16. 13. Quit you like MEN. And 2 Sam. 10. 12. Let us play the MEN. That the word here in my Text is ſo to be taken, is evident by comparing this with like places. Thoſe valiant men that came out of ſundry Tribes to David in Hebron, to turne the kingdome of Saul to him, of whoſe courage 1 Chron. 12. 23. and Proweſſe much is ſpoken, are ſtiled with the words here in my Text,

                              Mighty men of valour. They were therefore choice Men of courage, Men of valour, that are here meant in my Text: ſo as their Property doth further ſet out the Dignity of Chivalry. In that, though Natives onely and Iſraelites were deputed to the imployment here mentioned, yet not all ſorts of Natives and Iſraelites, but ſuch as were well reputed of for virtue and valour, and fit for their imployment.

                           3. THeſe Natives of name, ſelect Subjects, Men of mighty minds, to what imployment were they appointed? Even to Warre. They were men of WARRE. What need might there then be thought to be of Men of Warre? Had all the Nations round about proclaimed Warre againſt Iſrael, as in Ioſhuas time? Or was Warre within their Ioſ. 9. 1, 2.
                              
gates, as before Deborahs daies? Or were their enemies Iudg 5. 8. Iudg. 15. 11. Rulers over them, as when Sampſon began to be a Iudge in Iſrael? No ſuch matter. What then? Was this the time to take revenge of Iſraels enemies for former wrongs, to ſecure the Land of them, and to bring them under ſubjection? Surely no: All that, was ſufficiently done by David, that mighty man of Warre. Salomon now raigned. Salomon 
                              2 Sam. 8. 1, &amp;c. that Prince of Peace. His name proported Peace. For, Salomon had his denomination from 
                                 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                               
                              Peace. Peace alſo was promiſed to be in his daies. Both the forenamed Name of Peace, and alſo the promiſe of Peace are expreſly mentioned by God himſelf, where he thus ſpeaketh to David, Behold a Sonne ſhall be borne to thee, who ſhall be a man of rest: 
                              1 Chron. 22. 9. 
                              and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name ſhall be Salomon: and I will give peace and quietneſſe to Iſrael all his daies. This Salomon was herein an eſpeciall Type of the great Prince of Peace, Chriſt Ieſus, who is Our 
                              Iſa. 9. 6. Epheſ. 2. 14. 
                              Peace. In that then, where there was no feare of danger, nor any inſtant, urgent neceſſity required, in a time and place of Peace, under the raigne of a Prince of Peace, They, of whom you heard before, They were Men of WARRE. Surely preparation for Warre, Exerciſes thereto, Martiall diſcipline, Artillery tacticks, and Military trainings are matters of moment, commendable and honourable, not tobe rejected or neglected, but duly to be reſpected, and daily practiced, at all times, in all places, whether of perill or peace. This third and laſt branch therefore (as it is here ſet downe) even the Part which the forenamed Perſons performed, amplifieth the Dignity of Chivalry. For, They were Men of WARRE.

                           THus have I cleared the generall Scope of my Text, and laid open to your view this promiſed Pearle, the Dignity of Chivalry: by ſhewing how every word of my Text eyeth that marke, and every part and particle thereof much advanceth the ſame. With your good patience I purpoſe to dive yet more deeply into the depth of my Text. For the three Parts raiſed out of the three words thereof, as they have beene opened before you, (namely,

You all know that the Artillery Profeſſion is a Military Diſcipline, whereby choice perſons are inſtructed and enabled well to manage weapons of Warre, orderly to march in their due place, wiſely to encampe, and skilfully to embattaile. That to be trained up hereto, and well exerciſed herein, is an honourable function, belongeth to me, and to the matter in hand, to prove. How it appeareth by my text to be an honourable function, ye have heard. Hittites, Amorites, Perizites, Hivites, Iebuſites,
                              
and ſuch like ſervile perſons comming from a baſe of-ſpring, The ſouldiers profeſſion, and honourable function. were counted unworthy hereof. In Iſrael Iſraelites, Children of the ever renowned Patriarchs, Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob, Men of higheſt and greateſt eſteeme, THEY were Men of Warre. That function whereof baſe people were counted unworthy, and whereunto Men of beſt account muſt be deputed, is 
                                 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                              , without contradiction an honourable function. To like purpoſe it is noted that Abraham 
                              Gen. 23. 6.—14. 14. himſelfe, that Prince of God (as he is for excellency ſake ſtiled) trained up in Artillery exerciſes, not bond-ſlaves, bought with his money, but ſuch as were borne and brought up in his houſe, whom he had in high eſteeme. THEY were Men of Warre. Where as old Iſhai, an underſtanding and wiſe man had eight ſonnes, the three moſt honourable of 1 Sam. 17. 12, 13. them all, even the three eldeſt, were trained up in an Artillery profeſſion, THEY were Men of Warre. And though David, being the youngeſt of all, were by his Father deputed to be a ſhepheard, yet his brave mind affecting more honourable imployments, whereunto alſo he was incited 1 Sam. 17. 32, &amp;c. by divine inſtinct, he would needs prove to be a man of Warre, and indeed proved to be an approved Man of Warre. Saul himſelfe though a King, Ionathan, that lovely Ionathan, 
                              —18. 27, 30. Who of old were men of Warre. the Kings Sonne and heire, other of his brethren, all Kings Sonnes, THEY were Men of Warre. Of old, the beſt of a Nation, beſt in bloud and birth, as Kings, Princes, Nobles, their children and kindred: beſt in ſtature and properneſſe of body, as the three tall, proper ſonnes of Iſhai: beſt in courage, valour, and ſtrength, as they whom Saul choſe to follow him: beſt any other way, THEY were Men of Warre. 
                              1 Sam. 14. 52. What ſhall I more ſay? For the time would faile me to ſpeake in particular of Ioſhua, Gedeon, Iepthah, David, Iehoſaphat, Hezekiah, Ioſiah, and other like worthies, royall perſons, that were trained up in the Artillery Profeſſion, and thereupon waged many battels valiantly and victoriouſly. THEY were Men of Warre. We read of few battels in Scripture, wherein Kings, or other chiefe Governours had not their place and part. In Aſſyria, Perſia, Greece, and

                              Rome, the foure great Monarchies of the World, and the moſt famous States that ever were among the Heathen, all that in any excellency ſurpaſſed others, and were choſen to high and honourable places, for the moſt part, THEY were Men of Warre. The like may be noted of other well diſciplined and well governed polities. Moſt of our Dignities and Titles of honour have riſen from Artillery exerciſes, and Military imployments. Imperatores Emperours, were at Titles of honour moſt due to men of Warre. firſt Generals of armies: Duces Dukes, were Captaines of bands: Comites Earles, were Lieftenants, or Provoſts-Marſhalls: Milites Knights, were choice Souldiers: Equites Eſquires, were horſemen in Warre. Theſe and other like honourable titles were at firſt given to men, becauſe THEY were Men of Warre. The honour of Knight-hood is knowne properly to belong to ſuch as have well deſerved in Warre. Our Anceſtours got their greateſt renowne by warlike affaires. Can any now deny the Artillery profeſſion to have 
                                 Maiores noſtri ſummam rebus bellicis retulere gloriam. Ambr. Offic. l. 1. c. 35. Things requiſite to make men fit for Warre. been accounted an honourable function? Many honourable parts and endowments are requiſite to make a man expert in the Artillery profeſſion, as, Soundneſſe of judgement, Sharpeneſſe of wit, Quickneſſe of conceit, Stoutneſſe and courage of mind, Vndauntedneſſe in danger, Diſcretion mixed with paſſion, Prudence, Patience, Ability and Agility of body, and of the ſeverall parts thereof, with the like: all which do demonſtrate that the function whereunto they are required, is an honourable function.
                           
                           Matter both of Enducement and alſo of Encouragement doth this firſt obſervation afford.

                              ENducement to men of place, power, and parts, to Governours, to Nobles, to Rich men, to all that can any way add any honor to this profeſſion, to do what they can to the advancement of that which is in it ſelfe ſo honourable (as hath been ſhewed) and worthy of all the honour that can be

done unto it. The Apoſtle maketh mention of a double honour. 
                              1 Tim. 5. 17. That double honour is Countenance and Maintenance: both which are moſt due to this profeſſion; and moſt meet it is that both be given thereto. By this double honour have 
                                 Honos alit artes. Cic. Tuſc. quaeſt. lib. 1. all profeſſions in all ages beene brought to that perfection whereunto in any kind they have attained. The reſpect and reward which of old hath beene afforded to valorous, and couragious, well exerciſed, and well experienced Captaines and Souldiers in the foure fore-named Monarchies, made them ſo abound with Men of Warre, as the whole world was made to tremble at the heare-ſay of them. When once a queſtion was moved, why after Virgils time there were no more ſuch excellent Poets as he was, ſuch an anſwer as this was made:

                                 Good Poets thrive where liberall Patrons live:

                           An anſwer very pertinent to the point in hand: and fitly it may be applied to Captaines and Souldiers, who undoubtedly will abound in number, and grow very expert in all warlike exerciſes, where they are plentifully ſuſtained, and highly honoured. Were Artillery Gardens, and Military Fields for Martiall diſcipline and warlike trainings, foſtered and honoured thorow-out this land, as it is meet they ſhould be, Greece could have no cauſe to boaſt before England of her Achilles, Diomedes, Themiſtocles, Pericles, Pyrrhus, &amp;c. nor Rome of her Scipioes, Horatij, Fabij, Pompeis, or Caeſars. Meanes among us are more wanting then Men, or Minds. Oh that this Enducement might prevaile with Men of Meanes, to afford the honour of Regard, and honour of Reward to this Artillery profeſſion which is ſo worthy of double honour.

Howſoever your Profeſſion and practice be rejected or neglected by ſuch as ought moſt to reſpect it, yet it being honourable in it ſelfe, be encouraged to go on therein. The practice of a good thing is then moſt commendable, when, for the goodneſſe of it, it is practiſed. The puiſſant Princeſſe Deborab, that roſe up a Mother in Iſrael, and a Iudge therein, with admiration ſaid, of ſuch as offered themſelves willingly, My heart is on them. Had your Mother Iudg. 5. 9. 
                              London, or your Grand-mother England a tongue to expreſſe her mind, ſhe would with like approbation ſay to you, that ſhew your ſelves not only

                              willing, but alſo

                              forward to all Martial exerciſes, My heart is on you: yea the heart of him that loveth them that do good things cheerefully and willingly, and can and will honour them that honour him, his heart is on you. He accepteth the good things which are done of the doers owne accord, without compulſion by others, or remuneration from others, he accepteth them as done for his owne ſake. For Compare Rom. 13. 5. with 1 Pet. 2. 13. 2 Chron 17. 16 that which is done for conſcience ſake, is done for the Lords ſake. In this reſpect it is ſaid of Amaſiah the ſonne of Zichri a great Captaine and Commander of two hundred thouſand mighty men of valour, under King Iehoſaphat, that he willingly offered himſelfe unto the Lord: that is, he undertaking his function willingly, he did it as to the Lord. Thus of you that are of the ſame mind 
                                 Quoniam ſibi mercedem ab homine non quaeſrvit, à Deo accepit, ſicut legimus, &amp;c. Ambr de Abr Pat. l. 1. c. 3 it may be ſaid, ye offer your ſelves willingly to the Lord. And will not the Lord graciouſly accept ſuch? Abraham, who in this kind nor expected nor accepted reward of man, heard God thus ſpeaking to him, Feare not Abraham: I am thy ſhield, and thine exceeding great reward.

                           GIve me leave to extend this Encouragement to ſuch as are not yet of your Fraternity, nor have yet given their names to be of your Society, I meane ſuch as are in the floure of their age, of ſufficient ſtature and ſtrength, well able to afford time and meanes for Artillery exerciſes, to offer themſelves readily and chearefully to this honourable ſervice. The time which may be, and uſually is ſpared from your particular callings, cannot be better ſpent, (exceptis ſemper excipiendis, except duties of piety and charity, whereby all other things are ſeaſoned and ſanctified) I ſay vacant houres cannot better be ſpent then in the Artillery Garden, and in the practice of Martiall diſcipline there exerciſed, as ſhall §. 16. afterwards be more fully cleared.
                           But thus much of the firſt point, your honourable Function.

                           THe next concerning your Valorous Diſpoſition, is this.

Temp. c. 2 betwixt ſuch as were fit and unfit for Warre, that God cauſed Gedeon to obſerve for retaining ſome, and diſmiſſing others, tendeth to this purpoſe. The ſigne was this: They which lapped water with their tongues were entertained: They which kneeled downe to drinke were caſhiered. The Reaſon was this. They that kneeled downe to drinke, manifeſted thereby a luskiſh, ſluggiſh diſpoſition, and deſire to ſoope up their bellies full. The other that took up water in their hands, and lapped it with their tongues, ſhewed that their mind was ſo on their worke which they had to do, as they would not tarry to kneele downe; they would onely lap and be gone, a little for preſent neceſſity,

ſo much as might ſomewhat ſlacke their thirſt, and refreſh them, was ſufficient. Gods appointing ſuch onely to be retained for Warre, proveth the point in hand. Much more the expreſſe precepts which by God himſelfe and his Miniſters, were given unto thoſe that were ſet apart for Warre, to be valiant, and couragious. When God deputed Ioſhua to be Generall over all Iſrael, he gave him this expreſſe charge, Be ſtrong and of a good courage: which he further thus enforceth, Have not I commanded thee? Be 
                              Ioſ. 1. 6. 
                              ſtrong and of a good courage: Be not afraid, neither be thou 
                              —9. 
                              diſmayed. The like charge did Moſes in the name of the Lord give to all Iſrael, that were deputed to War, in theſe words: Be ſtrong and of a good courage, feare not, nor be afraid of them. Yea, God ordained it for a perpetuall Law, that when Deut. 31. 7. his people were to go to Warre, this Proclamation ſhould be made, What man is there that is fearefull and faint-hearted? let him go and returne unto his houſe. This Law God commanded Deut. 20. 8. 
                              Gideon, to proclaime before his army. The equity thereof was ſo clearely diſcerned by the very light of nature, Iudg. 7. 3. as many of the Heathen put it in practice: by name, Iphicrates the Athenian, and Epaminondas the Theban. If ſuch as are fearfull and faint-hearted be not fit for Warre, neither

It is uſuall with the Holy Ghoſt to ſet out ſuch men as were trained up and ſet apart to Warre, to ſet them out by their power and proweſſe. Of thoſe foure hundred thouſand men, that out of all the Tribes of Iſrael were choſen to fight againſt Benjamin and Gibeah, of every one of them it is ſaid that he was

                              Vir belli, a true Man of Warre, a valiant, a mighty man. Of thoſe many hundred thouſands which Ioab numbred in Davids time, it is ſaid that they were valiant men that drew ſwords, even every one of them (as the Hebrew phraſe implyeth.) And of thoſe many hundred thouſands alſo which out of Iudah and Iſrael were gathered together in two armies to fight one againſt another in Abijahs, and Ieroboams time, it is ſaid that they were The Hebrew is very emphaticall,

                              valiant men of Warre,
                              
                              mighty men of valour: which commendation is alſo given to thoſe many troupes of trained ſouldiers which Iehoſaphat maintained in Ieruſalem, 2 Chron. 17. 13. When David purpoſed to take vengeance of Ammon for the indignity and ignominy which was offered to his Ambaſſadours, he ſent Ioab and all the Hoſt of the Mighty men againſt them. Before the good Spirit of God left Saul, when he ſaw any ſtrong

Of David himſelfe, and 2 Sam. 17. 10. of ſuch as followed him, it is ſaid, that all Iſrael knew that he was a mighty man, and they valiant men. And of thoſe that came to him in Ziklag, it is ſaid that they were Mighty

Doth not this frequent mention of the might and valour of ſuch as were for Warre, ſhew, that they that take upon them to be Military men, muſt be of mighty minds; and that timorous, weake, and feeble perſons are not fit for the Artillery profeſſion?
                        
                        
                           §. 11. Of the damage of timorous ſouldiers.
                           VVHere God firſt enacted the fore-named Law, that no fearefull perſons ſhould goe to Warre, he rendreth this Reaſon, Leaſt his brethrens heart faint like his. Lamentable Deut. 20. 8. experience hath given too great evidence of the truth hereof. A few white-liverd, faint-hearted ſouldiers have oft beene the ruine of a great ſtrong Army which hath beene put to rout by reaſon of their fainting, and yeelding, ſo as ſuch men are more fit to ſtoope downe to a ſythe, then to take vp a ſword, to lift a pitchforke then to toſſe a pike, to handle a mattocke then to hold a musket, and to carrie a buſh-bill rather then a battell-axe. But on the other ſide, of ſuch uſe are valiant men and valorous minds, as their courage may ſupply the want of number: and though they be but few, not feare the face of many. It is noted that Abraham
                              
armed three hundred and eighteene, to expreſſe not the

Levit 26. 8. number of many, but the worth of choice ones. Well weigh the mighty and great exploits that were atchieved by Davids Worthies, by reaſon of their valour and courage, and you ſhall find, that a few couragious men to great armies of cowards, are as ſo many Lyons to whole heards of deere: Five may chaſe an hundred, and an hundred put ten thouſand to flight. Is it not then moſt meet that Military Men be of mighty minds?

                           IN applying this point. I will give you a divine direction for attaining to that which hath beene proved to be ſo requiſite, valor and courage. The direction is grounded on one of Salomons Proverbs, which is this, The wicked flie when no

                              man purſueth: but the righteous are bold as a lyon. Righteouſneſſe then maketh men valorous, wickedneſſe timorous.

They who know who are righteous, who wicked, cannot but acknowledge the truth of this proverbe. A righteous man cannot be here thought to be ſuch an one as hath in every part, point, and degree fulfilled the Law of righteouſneſſe according to the exact rule thereof. So there is none righteous: no not one. But in Goſpel-phraſe he is accounted righteous, that by true Faith applying to his ſoule the bloud of Chriſt, for purging away all his unrighteouſneſſe, and laying hold on Chriſts righteouſneſſe, to be juſtified thereby, doth his uttermoſt endeavour to keepe a cleare conſcience before God and Man. This man of all others muſt needs be the moſt valorous, whoſe ſoule is fenced with the breſtplate of righteouſneſſe, and ſhield of Faith, as well as his body, with armour and weapons of ſteele. He feareth nor Divell nor man. His conſcience will make him fight in none but a good cauſe. His Faith will make him couragious in that cauſe. If in his body he be wounded, he hath Pro. 18. 14. 
                              a Spirit to ſuſtain his infirmity. No paſſion can ſo ſupply the want of bloud and ſupport a man, as this Spirit. Might of mind

may overcome the force of fire. But if the earthen veſſell of

The death of his Saints is precious in the ſight of the Lord. But in Warre ſo much more precious it is, by how much more glorious. Get faith therefore and a good conſcience, get them, and keepe them, and they will keepe you from faint-heartedneſſe: they will put life, and ſpirit, and virtue, and valour into you: they will make you fit for the Artillery profeſſion: they will make you men indeed, true military men, of mighty minds.
                        
                        
                           §. 13. Of wickedneſſe making timorous.
                           ON the contrary ſide, A wicked man muſt not every one be accounted, that hath committed any ſinne, (for All have ſinned:) but ſuch an one as loveth wickedneſſe, and liveth therein, and that without true repentance. Faith Rom. 3. 23. which is accompanied with repentance, receiveth abſolution from God. Abſolution from God maketh ſinnes to be as not committed. For, the bloud of Chriſt, which cleanſeth us from all ſinne, cleanſeth all that believe and repent. But infidelity 1 Iohn 1. 7. and impenitency lay all ſinnes open to the wrath and vengeance of God. Knowledge and conſcience thereof cannot but fill the ſoule with many feares and terrours: whence Lev. 26. 36. D. Barlow in his Sermon preached at Pauls Croſſe. March 1. 1600. being the next Sunday after the execution of the late Earle of Eſſex.
                               it commeth to paſſe that ſuch wicked men feare and flie, when none purſueth them. Thus much is expreſly threatned againſt ſuch wicked men. I will ſend, ſaith God, a faintneſſe into their hearts, and the ſound of a ſhaken leafe ſhall chaſe them, and they ſhall flie as flying from a ſword, and they ſhall fall when none purſueth, &amp;c. It was the ſpeech of the valorous Earle of Eſſex, that Sometimes in the field encountering the enemy, the weight of his ſinnes lying heavy upon his conſcience,
                              
                              being not reconciled to God, quelled his ſpirits, and made him the moſt timorous and fearefull man that might be. Take heed therefore, O yee Captaines, Commanders, and other Members of the Artillery Company, take heed, as you would have your inward diſpoſition fit for your outward profeſſion, of ſuffering ſinne to lie up on your ſoules. Let your function be a motive to make you trie the truth of your converſion. Be ye righteous, that you may be indeed couragious.
                        
                        
                           §. 14. Of courage againſt ſpirituall enemies.
                           ANd to take occaſion from your externall profeſſion to put you in mind of your ſpirituall condition, which is, to be Souldiers of Chriſts bands, under his colours, whoſe Artillery Garden is the Church Militant, where your Martiall diſcipline in which you are daily trained up, is not for recreation and paſtime, but in very good earnest, to conquer, unleſſe you will be conquered, and that in a combate of great conſequence, wherin no earthly, but an heavenly inheritance is fought for, and for attaining thereto, not liberty of this world, but of the world to come, not a temporall, but eternall life is in great hazard. If ye overcome, ye are free for ever, and gaine an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in heaven. If ye be overcome, 1 Pet. 1. 4. ye are perpetuall ſlaves to Satan, that malicious enemy, who will hold you with everlaſting chaines under darkneſſe in torture and torment endleſſe and eaſeleſſe, mercileſſe and remedileſſe. To put you in mind, I ſay, of this your ſpirituall condition, know that if valour, and the forementioned ground thereof be ſo requiſite, as hath beene ſhewed, againſt bodily enemies, which are but fleſh and bloud, how much more againſt ſpirituall enemies, which are not fleſh and bloud, but principalities and powers. Theſe eſpecially, we ought to reſiſt ſtedfast in the Faith. The chiefe ſpirituall enemie of our ſoules, the Devill, from whom all our other ſpirituall enemies receive their ſtrength and courage, is

like a Wolfe, and that as in fierceneſſe, ſo in fearefulneſſe. A Wolfe, if he be ſtoutly reſiſted, will flie away, but if he be fearefully ſhunned or yeelded unto, then he will the more fiercely aſſault, and more greedily devoure. Even ſo the Devill: Reſist the Devill and he will flie from you. Give I am 4. 7.

Neither, if he prevaile, will he any whit the more ſpare thee for thy yeelding to him, but rather the more proudly inſult overthee. Wherefore, my Brethren, be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might: Put on the whole armour of GOD, that ye may be able to ſtand againſt the wiles of the Divell. Being thus armed, Watch ye, ſtand fast in the Faith, quit you like men, and be ſtrong: ſtand couragiouſly, and ye ſhall ſtand victoriouſly.

                              HItherto ye have heard of the Honour of your profeſſion, and of the Valour required by virtue thereof. The last point noteth the neceſſity and benefit thereof, which is this.
                                 In peace to prepare for Warre, is a principall part of prudence.
                              
                           
                           The moſt prudent Prince that ever governed people, put in practice this point of policie: even Salomon, to whom God ſaid, I have given thee a wiſe and an underſtanding heart,

                              ſo that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee ſhal any ariſe like thee. This Salomon enjoyed much peace, and had a promiſe to enjoy peace all his daies, and had no cauſe to feare any aſſaults or invaſions of enemies, all the nations round about being brought under by his Father David: Yet this Prince of Peace built fenced cities with walls, gates and barres, and chariot-cities, and cities of horſemen, and had his 2 Chron. 8. 5, 6 9. trained men of Warre, which are here noted in my Text; yea, to ſhew his store of warlike proviſion, it is expreſly

The firſt Father of that ſtocke, wiſe Abraham, whoſe houſe was a place of peace, (for the feare of God fell upon all nations round about him, they honored &amp; reverenced him, they accounted him a Prince of God) yet had this Abraham his Artillery Garden, wherein Gen. 14. 14. The number by Patent granted to the Artillery Company of London, is 500. which number was not full at the time of preaching this Sermon. were trained up and fitted for Warre, ſuch as were borne and brought up in his houſe: the number of which Company I ſuppoſe was greater then the number of your Company. For, at once on a ſudden he armed and led to the War more then three hundred trained men. And it is not likely that he left his houſe deſtitute of all defence. He had queſtionleſſe many more of that his Artillery Company. Now note the benefit hereof. On a ſudden, in a time of neceſſity, and caſe of extremity, he had them ready to reſcue five Kings, that were overthrowne by their enemies. To preſſe this patterne yet further for the point in hand, the Holy Ghoſt noteth that Melchizedek King of Salem, whoſe name declared him to be a King of Righteouſneſſe, whose nation ſhewed him to be a Prince of Peace, this Melchizedek King of Gen. 14. 18 19. 20. Heb. 7. 1, 2.

                              Salem, met Abraham with his forenamed troupes, bleſſed him and them, gave good entertainement to them all, and congratulated their returne, giving thereby an evident demonſtration of his approbation of Abrahams providence and prudence in maintaining an Artillery Garden for his houſe. The condition of Iehoſaphats Kingdome (who was the fourth ſonne that by lineall diſcent came from Salomon, 
                              2 Chron. 17. 10, 11, 13, &amp;c. and ſate on his Throne) was much like to Salomons. For the feare of the Lord was upon all the kingdomes of the land that were round about Iudah, ſo that they made no warre againſt Iehoſaphat: But in Teſtimony of amity, they ſent him yeare after yeare many preſents: Yet he placed ſorces in all the fenced cities of Iudah, and ſet garriſons in the Land, and had eleven hundred and threeſcore thouſand Men of Warre, mighty men of valour that waited on him, beſides thoſe whom he put in the fenced cities thorow out all Iudah. Admirable it is, and (but that the word of truth records it) incredible,

that in ſo ſmall a Kingdome as Iudah was, there ſhould be ſo many trained, expert, valiant men of Warre, as were in Iehoſaphats time. When Iudah and all Iſrael were joyned together, even all the twelve Tribes in one Kingdome, that Kingdome was nothing ſo ſpacious as England is. For, ſome of our Shires are larger then ſome of their Tribes were: and yet our Shires are in number above foure times more then their Tribes were: For, wee have In England 39. in Wales 13. above foure times twelve ſhires. How farre then do the three Kingdomes under the Dominion of our Soveraigne, England, Scotland, and Ireland, how farre do they exceed in ſpaciouſneſſe, the Kingdome of Iehoſaphat? Yet queſtion may be made, whether in theſe three Kingdomes, there be ſo many ſcore thouſands of trained Souldiers, well diſciplined men of Warre, mighty men of valour, as there were hundred thouſands in Iudah. We account twenty or thirty thouſand a great Army, fifty thouſand a royall Army. What then an hundred thouſand? What an hundred thouſand eleven times multiplied, and threeſcore thouſand added thereto? All theſe were under their Captaines, by name, Ready for Warre, Waiting on the King, to be ſent forth at his command: and yet all the fenced cities, which were very many, well repleniſhed with Garriſons, over and above thoſe 1160000. Surely they counted it an honour and ſafety to their land to have ſtore of trained ſouldiers, men expert, and ready for Warre at all times. Therefore frequent mention is made thereof. To omit other particulars, in Davids time, Ioab gave up the number and ſumme of fifteene hundred and ſeventy thouſand men of Warre, and yet left two 1 Chron. 21. 5. Tribes un-numbred. Surely there muſt needs be many Artillery Gardens, and they well repleniſhed, Martiall diſcipline muſt needs be there much exerciſed, where were ſo many thouſands, yea hundred thouſands trained up to Warre. If the wiſeman might ſend men to the Ants to learne of them Pro. 6. 6, &amp;c. to provide meat in the ſummer, and to gather food in the harveſt, much better may men be ſent to ſuch worthy patterns as were guided and approved by God, to be alwaies provided

with expert Souldiers trained up to Warre, even in times of peace. A maine difference is herein put betwixt wiſemen and fooles. We have a proverbe that ſaith, A foole will take his cloake in foule weather. But a wiſe man takes it with him at all times. He knoweth that a bright ſun-ſhine day may be ſoone turned into a cloudy rainy day. Peace is not like the unmoveable mountaines, but rather like to the variable skie. Wiſdome teacheth men to forecaſt the worſt, that they may be provided againſt the worſt, yea and thereby prevent the worſt. It is an old and true Motto, Pax armis, Peace is procured, preſerved, ſecured by preparations and proviſions for Warre.
                        
                        
                           §. 16. Of the benefits of Artillery Gardens.
                           WHere are many Artillery Gardens, and they much frequented, and Martiall diſcipline therein daily and duly exerciſed, Amitie with ſuch Kingdomes will be earneſtly deſired, and welcomely embraced: Kings of ſuch Kingdomes will be admired of their friends, and feared of their foes: Subjects of ſuch Kingdomes will find juſt and kind entertainment in forraigne parts: Natives and Allies wilbe ſecured: All manner of callings freely exerciſed: Lands and inheritances quietly enjoyed: Enemies danted: Invaſions and inſurrections prevented: and many, many evills avoided. They who reverence nor God nor man, where they ſee or heare of an over-maſtering power, wilbe kept within compaſſe; and though conſcience do not alter their inward diſpoſition yet conſtraint will order their outward converſation. But on the contrary, by fearleſſe and careleſſe ſecurity, The damage of neglecting Armes. by neglect of Artillery and Military exerciſes, by want of men meet for Warre, whole Cities and Kingdomes are oft made a booty and prey to their enemies, and ſuddenly ruinated. Inſtance Laiſh, they were a people that were at quiet and 
                              Iudg. 18. 27. 
                              ſecure, and the Danites on a ſudden ſmote them with the edge of the ſword, and burnt their Cities with fire. For a City and Nation to be without Artillery Gardens, is as dangerous as for a traveller to be without a ſword.
                           
                              
If the fore-mentioned patterns of prudent Princes, and wiſe Stateſ-men, recorded and approved in Gods Word, for training up armies of men in warlike exerciſes, and that in times and places of peace: If the many great benefits which therby ariſe and acrue to a Land and Kingdome, and the many great miſchiefs which are like to follow, upon a careleſſe neglect therof, be motives of force, motives of force are not wanting to prove, that, In peace to prepare for Warre, is a principall part of prudence.
                           
                        
                        
                           §. 17. Of the commendation of Artillery Gardens.
                           THe Application of this point, doth as neerly concerne this Artillery Company, as any of the former, both for juſtification, and alſo for approbation and commendation therof. Were our daies more halcyon, more quiet and peaceable then they are, or were they more free from feare of danger then they are, yet were your Artillery exerciſes lawfull, needfull, uſefull. True it is, that they are not in pitcht fields, pede pes, &amp; cuſpide cuſpis, face to face, foot to foot, ſpeare to ſpeare againſt enemies. They are in a quiet City, in a time of peace among your ſelves. They are like the Olympian games (inſtituted Plutarch. in Vita Theſei. by potent &amp; prudent Hercules) and the Isthmian ſports (ordained by Theſeus in imitation of Hercules) as delightſome preparations for war. They are like to the Pyrrick dancing

Plat. which was invented by Pyrrhus, called armed dancing, becauſe it was performed by men clad in armour, and warlike dancing, becauſe it was a repreſentation of ſundry kinds of battels, and a means to make them well to weld their Armour in War. They are like thoſe warlike ſports &amp; paſtimes which were practiced by Cyrus when he was a youth, and by his coequals, and play-fellowes. They are delightſome recreations. But what then? Are they therfore not lawfull? Or not needfull? Or not uſefull? He is too ſevere and cenſorious, and Xenoph de Cyri inſtit l. 1. Idem de Cyri min. Exped l. 5. goeth beyond the liberty of Gods Word, that condemneth all recreations, all delightſome paſtimes. He is too improvident and imprudent, that conceiveth nothing needfull or uſefull, wherof there is not neceſſary uſe in that preſent and inſtant time wherin it is uſed.
                        
                        
                           
                           §. 18. Of warlike recreations.
                           WEre your Artillery exerciſes onely for recreation, they are the beſt recreations that can be uſed. Were there at this time no need or uſe of them, they may be herafter of abſolute neceſſity. Delight in the things which men do, ſwalloweth up the pains that is taken about them, makes men the more diligent and conſtant in their exerciſes, and bringeth them to the greater experience &amp; perfection therein. Not only expert ſouldiers, but experienced Captains alſo are made by Military recreations uſed in Artillery Gardens. So as if ſuddenly Armies were to be raiſed of more men then all the Military Companies can afford, yet might ſufficient ſtore of Captains, and other Commanders and Officers be taken out of your Companies to governe and guide, to inſtruct and encourage ſuch as for want of former exerciſing were altogether inexperienced. Of the fifty thouſand that out of Zabulon came to David in Hebron, by way of commendation, it is ſaid that they could ſet a battell in array, and lead an 
                              1 Chron. 12. 33, 38. 
                              army. This implieth, that by their practiſing of Artillery exerciſes, they were all able to lead and order armies, to ſet them in array, and go before them. Beſides the policy of other nations and ages, our Anceſtors will diſcerned the need, uſe, and benefit of ſuch recreations as might fit men for War: which moved them to make ſuch ſtrict Statute Lawes for the exerciſe of ſhooting, as they did: For,
                           1. Every Maſter of a Family (except ſpirituall men, &amp; Iuſtices 9. Statute in 33. yeare of Hen. 8. of one Bench or other) was to exerciſe ſhooting himſelf.
                           2. He was to keep bows &amp; arrows continually in his houſe.
                           3. He was to bring up thoſe that were in his houſe in the exerciſe of ſhooting.
                           4. If he ſuffred any betwixt the age of 7 and 17, ſon or ſervant to abide in his houſe without bow or arrowes a moneth together, for every ſuch default he was to pay 40 ſhillings.
                           5. If a ſervant took wages, his Maſter might buy him bow, and arrowes, and deduct the price out of his wages.
                           6. If any man-ſervant betwixt the yeares of 17 and 60,

that took wages, were a moneth without bow and arrowes, for every ſuch default he forfeited 6 ſhillings and 8 pence.
                           In thoſe daies guns (the ſure and ſore meſſengers of death) were not ſo in uſe as now they are. Strength and skill in ſhooting was it that made our Engliſh nation famous for War. Their exerciſe therof in time of peace, and that for recreation, made them ſo expert as they were therein, at times of War. The Gen. 48. 22.

                              Ionathans uſing his bow and arrowes for recreation, ſheweth that of old among Gods people ſuch recreations were uſed as might the better fit men to War. The men of Gibeah without queſtion from their youth were exerciſed in ſport, to ſling ſtones at a marke, or els they could never have attained to ſuch extraordinary skill, as to Iudg. 20. 16. 1 Chron. 12. 2. 
                              ſling ſtones at an haires breadth and not faile. The skill which the men of Benjamin (of which Tribe thoſe Gibeonites were) are after this noted to have in ſlinging ſtones with the right and left hand, ſheweth, that this was an uſuall exerciſe of the youth and men of that Tribe.
                           Such recreations in peace as are preparations unto War, juſtly deſerve to be reckoned up among thoſe neceſſary vocations whereby Polities are preſerued: and while you are exerciſing your ſelves therein, you are imployed in your calling, and you go on in that way, where in God promiſeth to give his Angels charge over you, to beare you up in their hands,

                           VVHen I duly weigh that little which hath been ſaid, and withall conſider how much more might be ſaid of, and for the warrant, honour, need, uſe, and benefit of your Artillery profeſſion, I cannot ſufficiently wonder at the blindnes, careleſnes, improvidence, and ſecurity of this our age, in neglecting and diſ-reſpecting a matter of ſo great conſequence, ſo nearly concerning the glory, tranquillity, and ſafety

of the whole land, and of all ſocieties and ſeverall perſons therin. Me thinks that it is more then meet that every City and Corporation, if not every Towne and Village throughout the Land, ſhould have an Artillery Garden: and that the great populous Cities, eſpecially LONDON, ſhould have as many Artillery Gardens, as it hath Wards: and that publique allowances ſhould be afforded to ſuch as willingly offer themſelves to theſe Military exerciſes. I have heard of liberall legacies and bountifull donations given for making Cawſies, mending High-waies, building Bridges, and other ſuch like works, but little or nothing for purchaſing and maintaining Artillery Gardens, and the Warlike exerciſes appertaining thereto. I cannot therfore much wonder that there are no more ſuch Companies as yours is, and no more of your Company.

Be not therefore now ſlacke in proſecuting that which you have ſo well begun. Be diligent to keep your training daies, and to exerciſe your armes, that ſuch as by much practice are well experienced, may be preſidents and patterns to others: and thoſe others by like conſtant practice may attaine to anſwerable experience. Let no diſcouragements diſmay you. The leſſe encouragement you have from others, the greater is your praiſe, that ſo willingly take ſuch paines at your owne coſt, to make your ſelves ſerviceable for the defence, ſecurity, and ſafety of the Land and Kingdome where you live. In you my Text is in our daies and Land verified; for of you it may be truly ſaid, THEY were MEN of WARRE.

                  Since Englands Deliverances (noted in The Churches Conqueſt, §. 93.) were printed, I found a remarkable one omitted, which I had rather ſhould be here ſet out of place, then not ſet downe at all. Mr. Camden thus relates it.
                  OVt of the ſmothered fire of the rebellion in the North, there brake forth as it were out of the embers, a new flame, at Naworth in Cumberland neare the wall of Severus, called Picts Wall: kindled by Leonard Dacres ſecond ſonne to William Lord Dacres of Gilleſland. This Leonard Dacres (when the Lord Dacres his Nephew by his elder brother died) ſtomacked much that ſo goodly an inheritance was come by law to his Neeces (whom the Duke of Norfolke their father in law had betrothed to his ſonnes) and commenced ſuit againſt them: which, when it proceeded not according to his deſire, he fell to plotting and practicing with the Rebels. But when they had taken up the banners of Rebellion ſooner then he thought, and were proclaimed Enemies to their Country, whiles he was at Court, he was admitted to ſalute the Queene, tendring her his beſt ſervice againſt the Rebels, and in that reſpect was ſent home againe. By the way (as was found afterwards) he imparted counſailes with them by Meſſengers that went betweene him and them: and incouraged them, promiſing great matters from the Ambaſſadours of forraigne Princes: and amongſt other things, that he (having levied men in the Queenes name) would make away the Lord Scroope Warden of the Weſt March, and the Biſhop of Carleole: which when he could not effect, he ſent letters of Commendations after the Earles that were flying to the Scots, ſeized upon the Castle of Greiſtoke and other houſes belonging to the Dacres, fortified the Caſtle of Naworth as his owne inheritance, and under colour of defending his owne and reſiſting the Rebels, gathered together 3000 of the Rank-riders of the borders, and ſome others which were moſt devoted to the Dacres,
                     
which in that tract was a name of great reputation. Againſt theſe marcheth the Lord Hunſdon with the old garriſon ſouldiers of Barwicke. The Rebels not truſting to their ſtrong holds, march forth to encounter him: and a three cornered battell flanked on every ſide with horſemen, receive him at the little river Gelt. The fight was maintained on both ſides very ſharply: and Leonard (though he were crook-backed) omitted nothing that could be required in a moſt valiant Leader: but after very many of his men were ſlaine, he left the victory (though with ſmall joy) to the Lord Hunſdon, and withdrew himſelf into Scotland hard by: from whence ſhortly after he croſſed the Seas into the Low Countries, and died a poore man at Lovaine: ſo as it ſeemeth his father was not much deceived, who upon his death-bed, prayed God to ſend him much ſorrow for his diſobedience.
