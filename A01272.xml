            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

yow wyll brenge no ſcripture agaynſt me.
But only reherſſe my ſcrypture againe whiche
I haue alleged vnꝑfeytlye and wounde
me with myne owne dartes / &amp; wyll but euen
do as one that playeth at tennes wyth another

            Not withſtodinge yow know ryght wel
that it is not I noughe for a man playinge

at tēnes to toſſe the ball agayn / but he muſt
ſo toſſe it that the tother take it not. For yf
the other ſmyte it ouer agayne then is the
game in as great ieoberdy as it was before
beſydes that he muſte take hede that he neyther

cauſes of the makyng of youre .i.
boke of purgatory without alleginge
any textes of ſcripture for
the proue therof which are the cō
               trouerſye
of .ii. ſortes of people.
One ſorte you ſay be thoſe that beleue not ī
Chriſt / but denie chriſt &amp; his ſcripture as be
the turkes paynims &amp; ſuh other miſcreaūts
An other ſorte be they that beleue in chryſte
&amp; his ſcripture nor wyll denye no texte of holy
ſcripture / but yet they wyll cōſtrue expōde
and interprete this textes after theyr owue
wylles and obſtinate mynde. &amp;c.
            Now let vs cōſyder your forſayd cauſes
&amp; pōder whether your boke haue or may do
any ſuch good as you ſay pretended / &amp; whether
it haue cōuerted thoſe ſortes of people / or
els by any thynge likely to do ſuche a facte.
And fyrſt let vs ſe what it profyteth the
fyrſte ſorte which are infideles not beleuīge
ī chryſt nor his ſcripture.John. 3. Our ſa
                  •
               iour chriſt
ſaieth / he that beleueth is not dāpned / &amp; Ihō
Bap. cōfirmeth the ſame ſaying: he that beleueth
in the ſon̄e hath euerlaſtīge lyffe / but
he that beleueth not in the ſonē ſhall not ſe
lyfe / but the wrath of god abydeth vppō hī.
Here it is euident not be my expoſicyō / but
by the cōſent of all chriſtē men / that thoſe in
fideles are dāpned / for what entēt thā ſhulde
Raſtel teache thē that there is a purgatory:
without chriſt their is no way but dāpnacy

on as ſcripture &amp; all faythfull men teſtifye.
Thē wolde I know by what way he wolde
ꝑſwade that there were a purgatory (which
ſhulde be away &amp; ameane to ſaluacion and
not to dāpnaciō) for them which beleue not
in Chryſt. This I am ſure of (&amp; I thīke Raſtell
beleueth it alſo) that the infydeles ſhall
neuer come in it thoughe theire were one?
This you maye ſe that his fyrſt cauſe is verye
vayne / &amp; that yf they dyd beleue it they
were in dead deceyued.
            Now let vs ꝓcede vnto the ſecōde ſorte of
poeple (which beleue in chriſt &amp; his ſcripture
&amp; yet miſconſtrue it / expoūding it after their
owne willes) And let vs ſe what frute they
take of this boke &amp; what it profyteth them &amp;
we ſhall fynde that it leſſe ſerueth theſe mē
thē the fryſte: for if this men beleue in chryſt
&amp; in his ſcripture / thē is it not poſſyble that
they ſhulde receaue or admytte that thynge
whiche is againſt the ſcripture bothe by the
expoſiciō of thē ſelues &amp; of al the worlde For
this is both agaynſt ſcrypture and all faithfull
men that there ſhulde be anye waye to
helth yf we exclude Chriſt and his ſcripture
And ſyth purgatorye is counted awaye to
helthe / he that wolde go aboute to proue it / ſecludynge
Chryſt and ſcrypture is againſt
ſcrypture and all faythfull men.
            Beſydes that yf they be ſo obſtynate
that they wyll not receaue the verye

ſcripture but expounde it after theyr owne
wylles &amp; wreſt it after the ſame / then wyll
they moche leſſe receaue your boke which is
ſo playne againſt ſcripture / and therfore yf
yow wolde thīke that they coulde be tamed
by your boke which notwitſtonding ſo wreſteth

yow to him that hath a wilde horſe to tame
which when he ꝑceueth that he cā not holde
him with a ſcokry ſhe ſnafle wyll yet labour
to breake hī with a rotyn twyne threde: So
that I can eſpye no maner of profyte that
can come of youre boke yf yowe can allege
no better cauſes thē yow yet ſhew / but that
it had ben a greate dele better on wryten.
            And brother Raſtel where yow ſay that
I auaunce &amp; boſte my ſelfe moch more then
becometh me / and that I detraycte &amp; ſlander
my neyghbours / and that I prouoke all mē
that read my boke rather to vyce thē to vertu
with ſuch other thynges as ye lay to my
charge / I truſt I ſhall declare my inconuenyence
and geue yow a ſufficient anſwere.
            
               ¶An anſwere to Raſtels fyrſt Chapter
whych reproueth me for booſtynge
my ſelfe.
               IN the fyrſt chapter of this boke RaſtelRaſtell
laboureth to proue that I am ſore ouer
ſene in laudinge &amp; boſting my ſelfe and that
I like my ſelfe ſo wel that he is ſure that other

men do lyke me the leſſe / &amp; that he fereth
that god wyll therfore lyke me &amp; fauour me
rather the worſe then the better.
               Here he iogeleth wyth me &amp; wolde makeFrith
me beleue that he toſſed me myne owne ball
agayne / but when I beholde hit / I perceaue
it to be non of myn: for he hathe cut out all
that ſhulde make for me ſo that he hath geuen
it cleane an other ſhape then euer I entended
that it ſhulde haue as it appereth by
his wryting which reherſeth my wordes in
this maner.
               I am ſure there are many that merueyllRaſtell.
that I being ſo yonge dare atempte to dyſpute
this matter againſt theſe .iii. perſones.
But my wordes are this / I am ſure thatFrith
there are manye that wyll moche meruayll
that I beynge ſo ionge and of ſo ſmall lerning
dare diſpute this matter &amp;c.
               Here Raſtell leueth out the wordes (and
of ſo ſmake lernynge) for yf he had put that
in he had be wrayed him ſelfe. For I thynke
no man ſo madde as to ſaye that he which
ſayeth him ſelfe to be both yonge &amp; of ſmall
lerninge ſhulde prayſe &amp; boſte him ſelfe.
               Alſo immediatly after the wordes of his
fyrſte allegacion I ſay on this maner: And
as touchinge my lerninge I muſte nedes aknowlege
(as the trueth is) that it is verye
ſmal which I thynke is but a baſe boſtīge / and
anon after I ſay I wolde not that any
man ſhulde admitte my wordes or lerninge

excepte they wyll ſtonde with the ſcripture / &amp;
be approued therby / lay them to the touchſtone
and trye them with goddes worde / yf
they be founde falſe and cōtrary then dāpne
them / and I ſhall alſo reuoke them wyth al
myn harte. &amp;c.
               Hynallye I exhorted them to reade my
boke not aduertyſynge whoo ſpeaketh the
wordes but rather what is ſpoken / by why
the wordes you myght well ſe that I entended
not to boſte my ſelfe / and all this haue
I wryten / and he lefte it out euē in the fyrſte
page (as he calleth it) wherin he reporteth
that I boſte my ſelfe.Raſtell.
               
               Notwithſtondinge one thinge doth ſore
vexe him that I ſhulde recyte the pyſtell of
S. Paule wherbye he ſayeth I wolde haue
mē beleue that I had the ſprete of god and
thynke that though I be yonge that I ſe viſyons
and eſpye the truethe / and that my elders
haue dremed dremes and wandered in
phantaſyes.
               This he recounteth to be a great boſte &amp;Frith
that this one place ſhulde wynne hym the
felde where vnto I anſwer that in dead my
wordes do not proue that thinge / which you
ſeme 
                     •
                  o ſuerly to gather of thē / but my wordes
doo argue on this maner / that no man
ought to condēpne a thinge before he reade
it 
                     〈◊〉
                   then to geue ſentēce / and becauſe you
ſeme ignorant in the matter I ſhall declare
it vnto you / and howe it ſtondithe / it is a

coloure of rethoryke / and is called auantopodoſis
that is to ſaye an anſwer to an obiecciō
that a mā myghte haue here made on
this maner: thou graunteſt thy ſelfe yonge
and ſo ſmale lernynge doſte thou thē thinke
that we ſhall once reade or regarde thy boke
/ ſpeciallye ſythe it is wryten agaynſte
auncyent men bothe of great wytte and dignyte?
to this twoo poyntes I anſwere preuentinge
theyr obieccion that they ſhuld not
diſpyſe it becauſe of my youthe / for as the
ſprete of god is bounde to no place / euen ſo
is he not addicte to anye age or perſon but
enſpyreth where he wyll and when he wyll
&amp; brenge in for an enſample that he eſpyred
yonge Tymothe prouinge ther by that the
youth of it ſelfe is not to be diſpiſed / but accordinge
to the lernynge whiche it bryngeth
and that therfore they maye not diſpiſe my
youth but fyrſt read what doctrine I brīge
and therafter do iudge it: no more in this I
proued not that I am enſpyred and haue
the ſprete of god as Tymothe had / but only
proue that God maye enſpyre youthe as
he dyd Tymothe / and that therfor ye ought
fyrſte to reade before you condempne / for
you know not who is enſpired &amp; who not vntyl
you haue read their workes or ſene their
factes. Thus you may ſe that my wordes define
not that al yough is enſpyred although
ſom may be / but I exhorte that no man deſpyſe1. Teſſ. 1.
propheſies / but proue all and approue

that is good / and to make the matter more
playne I ſhall brynge you an example out
                     •
                  
of Paule to the Hebreus whyche exhortethHebre. 13.
thē to hoſpytalyte / for by that ſom men onwares
haue receaued angeles to herber / be
not therfore vnmyndful of it / here Paule exhorteth
yow to hoſpitalyte &amp; ſhewyng yow
that by thoſe meanes ſome men haue receaued
angels into their houſe / wolde not haue
yow thynke that al the geſtes which he ſhal
receaue ſhalbe angels / but ſome ſhal be 
                     •
                  ewde
loſelles. And lykewiſe I inexor
                     •
                  inge yow
to reade my boke / and not dyſpyſynge my
yowgth becauſe that ſumtyme godde enſpyreth
the yōge / worde not haue yow thīke
that the bokes made of yonge men (whyche
ye ſhal receaue) ſhalbe holſome doctrine / but
ſome men be lewde &amp; vnfrutefull / neuertheleſſe
euen as yf they receiued not thoſe geſtes
they ſhulde alſo put awaye angels yf anye
came So if yow deſpice to reade ſuch bokes
as be wryten by yonge men yow maye alſo
fortune to diſpyce thē which are wryten by
the inſpyracyen of Chryſtes ſprete and therfore
ye ought to reade them.
               But be it in cauſe I had in dead prayſed
my ſelfe (as I haue not) and that I had ſayed
that I had the ſprete of god / what inconuenience
ſhulde folowe therof? wolde yowe

                     〈◊〉
                   argue that my doctrine were falſe? yf
that were a good argument / then were thryſtes
doctrine falſe / then were Paule a falſe

prophete and oure ſayth nothynge for chriſt
ſayd to the Iewes that he was the lyght o
                     •
                  
the worlde.Iohn. 8. And agayne he ſayd: it is my father
that glorifyed me whom you call youre
god. Nowe yf it had bene a ſufficient argument
to condempne his doctrine / becauſe the
worlde callethe it boſtynge than ſhulde we
haue beleued no truth at all. Beſydes that
Paull ſemeth not a lyttel to boſte him ſelfe2. Cor. 11
yf men loke on it with a carnall yie / for he
ſayeth that he thinketh not him ſelfe inferior
vnto the hyeſt apoſtels / &amp; ſayeth agayne
that yf they glorye to be the myniſters of
Chryſte (thoughe he ſpeake vnwyſlye) he is
more copyous in laboures / in ſtrypes aboue
meaſure / in preſon more often / often at the
poynte of dethe. &amp;c.
               Shulde we for this wordes thynke that
his doctrine were not ryght? Naye verelye
that doth not inproue the doctrine / but that
it may be good and holſome for a man may
boſte himſelfe and doo well ſo he referre the
prayſe to God from whom all goodnes cometh:
but be it in caſe that I ſhulde ſay that
god of his mere mercy &amp; for the loue that he
oweth me in Chryſte and his bloude had geuē
me his ſprete that I might be to his laude
&amp; prayſe to whom be thankes for euer. Amē.
wolde you thyncke that this were ſo greate
aboſtinge that the doctrine ſhulde be impayred
therbye? Ah blynde gydes I praye God
geue you the lyght of vnderſtondinge / I beſeche

you brother Raſtell be not diſcontent
wyth me yf I axe you one queſtyon / be ye a
Chryſten man or no? I am ſure you wyl anſwere
yes / then yf I broughte you the texte
of Paule whiche ſayeth:Rome. 8. he that hathe not
the ſprate of god is non of his / I praye you
how wil you auoyde it Notwithſtōding yf
you wolde auoyde that texte / yet wyl I ſay
an other blocke in the waye that you ſhall
not be able to remoue / and that is the ſayinge
of Paule.
                     
                        •
                     . Cor. 13. 2. Corinth. 13. Knowe ye not
your ſelues that Chryſte is in you? excepte
ye be reprobate perſones / now howe ſoeuer
you wolde iudge of youre ſelfes / I thynke
verely that I am no ſuche &amp; therfore where
as before I dyd not ſo wryte. Now I certifye
yow that I am chryſtes, conclude what
ye wyl / and the day ſhal come that you ſhal
ſuerlye knowe that ſo it is / albeit in meane
ſeaſon I be reputed a laughingſtoke in this
worlde for I knowe in whome I truſte and
he came not deceue me.
               Then bryngeth he agaynſte me that IBaſtell
ſaye we haue bene longe ſecluded frome the
ſcripture &amp; alſo that oure fore fathers haue
not had the lyghte of godes worde opened
vnto them.
               I meruayll what Raſtell meanethe byFrith
bryngynge this for his purpoſe / for I thīke
it no boſtinge of my ſelfe / but yf ye thynke
that it be vntrue / I thinke he is very blinde.

For what ſcripture hathe the poore cōmens
bene admitted vnto euen tyll this daye? It
hath ben and locked vp in a ſtrange tounge
and from thē that haue attayned the knowlege
of that tounge hath it ben locked with
a thouſand ſalſe gloſes of antichryſtes makynge
and innumerable lawes. And where
I ſaye oure fore fatheres haue not hadde
the lyght of goddes worde opened vnto thē / I
meane that they haue not the ſcrypture
in theyr own mother tonge / that they might
haue conferred theſe iuggeling miſtes wyth
the lyght of goddes worde as the proceſſe
of my wordes can teſtifye whiche he hathe
holy lefte out / but I beſeche the chryſten reader
once to read the place for my diſcharge
and his confuſyon / ye ſhall fynde it in the
ſeconde lefe of my boke.
               And now he allegeth agaynſte me that
I ſhulde ſaye this:Raſtell iudge Chryſten reader
what reaſons Raſtell hathe broughte and
how he hath ſoluted them / for in my mynde
bothe his reaſons and ſolucyons are ſo childyſhe
and vnſauery / ſo vnlerned and baren
ſo fulle of fautes and phantaſyes that I
rather pitye the mannes depe ignoraunce
&amp; blyndnes which hath ſo deceyued him ſelf
thorowe phyloſophye and naturall reaſon / then
I feare that he by his vayne probacyons
ſhulde allure any man to conſent vnto
him.
               
                  
I thynke Raſtell layeth not this againſt
me / becauſe I boſte my ſelfe in thes wordes:
                     
                        •

               And fynallye where as I exorte all mē
to iudge and conferre the ſcriptures whych
ſyr Thomas More and my lorde of Rocheſtre
allege for theyr opiniōs and wolde haue
them to pondre theyr reaſons and my ſolucions
vnto them annexinge theſe wordes I
am ſure that my ſmale lernynge hath
                     •
                   condempned
theyr hye eloquence / that my folye
hathe brought to nought theyr wiſdom and
that my youth hath
                     •
                   diſcloſed their feſtered
ignoraunce.
               There Raſtell thynketh that I ſtondeFrith
well in my owne conceyte and boſte my ſelfe
aboue the mone becauſe I touche Maſter
More his kynſmā: but let Raſtell take this
for an anſwer / yf Maſter More wolde kepe
him within his owne bondes that is wythe
medelynge of worldlye matteres onlye / I
wolde neuer cōpare wyth him / yet he muſte
remember that a dawler maye correcte him
in his owne crafte / but it is euen as Socrates
ſaythe / when a man is wyſe in one thīge
then wyll he take vppon hym to defyne all
thynges and be ignoraunt in nothynge and

ſo dyſdayneth. The gyfte that he hathe and
proueth himſelfe onwyſe.
               Furthermore I ſe no great prayſe that
I here attribute vnto my ſelfe. But confeſſe
my ſmalle lernynge my folie and my youth / neuertheleſſe
yf he recounte it a prayſe becauſe
I ſaye it hath
                     •
                   condempned theyr hye
eloquence and theyr wyſdom / and diſcloſed
theyr ignoraunce / then let him alſo annexe
the wordes that I wrote ſayinge: and it is
euen the olde practyſe of God to choſe the
folyſhe thynges of the worlde to confounde
the wyſe / to choſe the weake / to confounde
the myghtye / and to choſe the vyle thynges
whyche are of no reputacion to confounde
them of hye degre / that no fleſhe myghte
boſte it ſelfe in his ſyghte to whome only be
prayſe and thankes for euer Amen.
               where all men maye ſe that I referre all
prayſe to hym whych onlye is worthye: and
ſo I maye conclude that you haue not loked
indifferentlye on my boke.

               Alſo he allegeth that I ſhulde ſay / thatRaſtell

therfore he may ſay what he wyll only he caryed

he allegeth Rom. 8. that there is no dampnacion
to them which be in chryſt Ieſu if they
lyue not after the fleſhe / and euen ſo ſaye I / but

be frelye iuſtifyed by grace / by Chryſtes redempcion
to ſhewe his iuſtice for the remiſſion
of ſynne done before (and yet ſayth Raſtell)
Paull ſayeth that the lawe is not deſtroyed
by faythe but made ſtable / but this
hath Frith lefte oute of his booke to cauſe
the people to beleue that they be clene purged
/ by the bloude of Chryſte only / and that
there neade no purgatorye.
               By theſe wordes you maye euydentlyeFrith
perceyue what Raſtell meanethe by this allegynge
of paul / for the eſtablyſhynge of the
lawe / verelye that the worke of the lawe
ſhulde iuſtifye and cleane purge you from
ſynne whyche is contrarye to Paull and al
ſcripture / for euen in this ſame Chapytre
that he allegeth Paull ſayeth: that of workes
of the lawe noo fleſſhe ſhalbe iuſtyfyed
in his ſyghte / and ſayeth that the ryghtwyſnes

of god cometh by fayth of Ieſu Chryſte
vnto all and vppon all that beleue. But
as touchynge good workes I wyll touche
more hereafter.

muſte folow as well that there is

continue ſtyll in ſynne / for yf we be bleſſed

he wyll not caſte vs in to purgatorye / then
he wyll not caſte vs in to hell what ſoeuer
ſynne we do commytte.
               Here Raſtell vtterith his blyndnes vntoFrith
you / and ſheweth you what vnderſtondinge
he hathe in ſcripture / fyrſte he armeth hymſelfe
with a falſe ſuppoſicyon and yet there
vppon he concludeth his argument falſelye
his ſuppoſicion is this / that all men whiche
are baptyſed with materiall water are verye
Chryſten men / and haue the true faythe
&amp; be thoſe which paule affirmeth to be without ſpotte blame or wryncle. But therto I ſay nay / for euen as the outwarde circumciſyon
made not the Iewes the electe people
and chylderne of ſaluacyon / ſo doth not the
outwarde baptiſme make vs the faythfull
membres of Chryſte / but as they were the
chyldren of god which were inwardly circū
                  cyſed / euen
ſo they that are waſſhed inwardly
from the cōcupiſcens of this worlde
are the mēbres of chryſte / whom Paul affyrmeth

ſo to be purged thorowe his bloude.
Againe: you may knowe that Raſtell knoweth
no nother fayth / but that whiche maye
ſtonde wyth all maner of ſyn̄e / but the faith
which we ſpeake of is the ſame which worketh
thorow charyte / wherof Paull ſpeaketh.

Raſtel / verely becauſe I allege S. Ioh.
S. Paule / Ezechiell &amp; Hieremye to quenche
the note fyer of purgatory and allege no auctorityes
to proue good workes / wher vnto
I anſwer (as I dyd before) that it is nothīg
to my purpoſe / for the prouing of good workes
doth

                      neyther make for purgatorye nor

againſte his dialoge let all men reade

                  Raſtell taketh the mater very greuouſlyRaſtell
that I attempte to allege howe S. Iohn̄
S. Paule ſende vs to chryſte / and thē adde
that we know no nother to take away ſyn̄e
but only chriſte / &amp; becauſe I adde this worde
onlye / therfore he thinketh that I clene deſtroye
repentaunce where vnto I anſwereFrith
that I added not this worde only / for noughte
but I dyd it by the auctorite of ſ. Iohn̄
which ſayth: yf we walke in the lyght as he
is in the lyght we haue felowſhip with eche
other &amp; in the bloude of Ieſu chryſte his ſone

purifyeth vs from all ſynne / whervppon I
ſaye that for vs which are in the light / his
bloude only is ſufficiēt / but for your chryſtē
men which continue ſtyll in ſyn̄e &amp; walke in
darkenes after theyr father the deuell, muſt
ſom other meannes be foūde or els they ſhal
neuer entre in to the kyngdome of heauen.
                  But becauſe I wyll be ſhorte let Raſtel
note that I finde .ii. maner of repētance one
is without fayth &amp; is ſuch a repentāce as Iudas
&amp; Raſtels chriſten men which
                        •
                      continue
ſtyll in ſynne / haue at the later ende whyche
doth rather purchace thē an halter then the
remiſſion of ſynnes.
                  An other repentance foloweth iuſtificacion
&amp; remiſſion of ſyn̄es &amp; is a floryſhynge
frute of fayth / for when by fayth we do perceyue
the fauour &amp; kyndnes that our louing
father hath ſhewed vs in his ſone chryſt Ieſu / and
that he hath recōcyled vs vnto himſelfe
by the bloude of his ſone / then beginne
we to loue hī / the more we hate the body of
ſynne &amp; lament and be ſory that our mēbres
are ſo frayle / that they can not fulfyll the
lawe of God and ſo in mornynge and bewaylynge
oure infyrmyte / it cauſeth vs to
abſtayne from bothe / meate &amp; drinke &amp; all
worldly pleaſures which is the pure faſtīge
that we talke of / but you vnderſtonde it not:
and this repētance cōmeth not to purge the
ſynnes which is cōmitted before / but onlye
taketh an occaſiō by the ſyn̄es before cōmitted

to knowe what poyſon their remayned
in our fleſſhe &amp; ſeaketh
                        •
                      al meanes to make
vs hate this body of ſynne and to ſubdue it
with all maner of workes that God hath
                        •
                     
appoynted to thentēt that it ſhulde in tyme
to come no more diſpleaſe god oure mooſte
mercyfull father which of gentelnes ſo oftē
pardoneth and forgeueth vs / as I haue touched
before. This is the maner of repētaūce
which I fynde in ſcrypture / but this helpeth
that we ſhulde ſynne no more / but what Raſtell
dremethe I woote not. But to expreſſe
to the vttermoſte what I meane by repentaunce
/ marke this example yf a man bylde
an houſe which doth coſte him moch labour
and mony / &amp; haue layde no 
                        •
                     ſure fundacion / but
that whē a tempeſte cōmith his houſe
doth fall / then wyll he be very ſory / and repēt
that he hath ſo foliſhly beſtowed his mony
&amp; labour. Notwithſtōdinge al this great
ſorow and repentaunce can not ſet vp his
houſe agayne which is fallen / but only it taketh
an occaſyon by the ruyne of the houſe
to teache the owner witte againſte another
tyme that when he buildeth agayne he may
make a ſure foundacion. Euen ſo though
                        •
                     
thou repent neuer ſo much that cā not gette
remiſſion for the ſynnes that is paſte / but
that muſte be pardoned onlye by the faythe
of Chryſtes bloude. Neuertheleſſe it dothe
teach the wytt &amp; lerne the to tame thy body
and ſubdue it / &amp; caſt a lowe fondacion / that

in tyme thou mayſte the better reſyſte the aſſautes
of the deuell / the worlde &amp; the fleſſhe.
This doth Frith teache of repentaunce / let
the worlde take it as they wyll / but chyrſtes
ſhepe do here his voyce.
               
               
                  The thirde errour which Raſtell layeth
aginſt me is that I wolde make mē beleue
that they neade to do penaunce for
the ſatiſfaction for theyr ſynnes.
                  EVery chyld may anſwer him to this yf
he ouer reade or ꝑceyue what I wrote
before of repentaunce / for as they take repē
                     taunce
for the ſorowe and mornyng that foloweth
the cryme / euē ſo they calle penaūce
the good workes that enſue of repētance / &amp;
this good workes which folow do mortifie
the mēbres / &amp; exercyſe vs in goddes cōmaundementes
that we ſynne no more / but they
can get no more remiſſion of the ſyn̄e which
is once paſt thē that which they call
                        •
                      repentaunce
&amp; yet do we neyther deſtroye ſorowynge
for ſyn̄e nor good workes as he falſlye
reporteth by vs / but we teach you how they
ought to be done &amp; that they are fruytes of
fayth / &amp; mortifye our membres and are profitable
to our neyghbour / &amp; a teſtymony vnto
vs that we ar chyldrē of our heuēly fat.
as by exāple I ſay that nother the ſon̄e nor the
mon̄e do iuſtifie vs / or purchaſe remiſſion
of our ſyn̄es &amp; yet I wolde not that Raſtel
ſhulde ſaye that I denye or deſtroye the
ſon̄es the moue / for I ſaye it that withoute

that we can haue no day / &amp; that we can not
be without thē / and as touching the ſoluciō
of this that penaūce takinge in his largeſt
ſignificacion / both for good workes &amp; takīg
of paynes is not ſatiſfaction for ſynnes / I
muſte tell you once againe that there are .ii.
maner of ſatiſfacciōs / the one is to god / the
other to my neyghbour. To god can not all
the world make ſatiſfactiō for one crime / in
ſo moche that yf euery graſſe of the grounde
were a man as holy as euer was. Paull or
Peter &amp; ſhulde pray to god all ther lyfe lōge
for one cryme / yet coulde they not make ſatiſfaction
for it / but it is only the bloude of
chryſte that hath made full ſatiſfactiō vnto
god / for all ſuche crymes. heb. 7.Hebreo. 7 or els were
there no nother remedye / but we ſhuld al peryſhe.
There is an other ſatiſfactiō whiche
is to my neighbor whō I haue offēded / whō
I am boūde to pacifie as we .ii. cā agre / &amp; as
the lawes of the realme determine betwene
vs / as if I had deformed hī: thē am I boūde
to pacefye hym &amp; to reſtore hym to his good
name agayne / if I haue morthered any mā
then by the lawes of the realme I muſt dye
for it to pacifye my neyghbour &amp; the comen
welthe / but yet I am ſure Raſtell is not ſo
childiſh as to thinke that this ciuile ſatiſfactiō
is the verye ſatiſfactiō which pacifyeth
gods wrath for breking his law: for if thou
morther a mā &amp; ſhuld dye a c. times for it yet
except thou haue ſatiſfactiō of criſtes bloud

thou ſhalt be dāpned therto: and ſo I ſpake
that no temporall payne was inſtituted of
god for thentēt that we ſhuld ſatiſfye gods
wrathe therby / as it is playne in my boke y
                        •

                  The fourthe errour that he layethe agaynſte
me is that I wolde perſwade
the people that good workes are nothynge
auaylable.
                  NOw are we come to the fourth erroure
where Raſtel vntrulye reporteth on me
that I wolde ꝑſwade the people that good
workes don by any man in this world is nothynge
auaylable vnto him that doth them
and that it is no hurte nor hynderaunce vnto
any man thought he neuer do none. Becauſe
I ſaye they iuſtyfye not before God / therfore
he thynketh that other men woide
vnderſtonde me as wyſelye as he doth / and
argue that they are nothynge auaylable / but
I muſte deſyre him to put on his ſpectacle
/ and loke agayne vppon my boke / and he
ſhall fynde theſe wordes. Paraduenture

charite the welth of our neyghbour &amp;c.
                  I wonder, that Raſtell is not aſhamed to
ſay that I wolde make thē beleue that they
ar not auaylable / therfore good reader note
my wordes / fyrſt I ſaye we muſte do thē becauſe
god hath cōmaunded them / is it not auaylable

ꝑfyte of my neighbour: is it not auaylable?
therdely I ſay that they tame oure fleſhe / is
it not auaylable: fourthely I ſaye they are
to the glorie of god is it not auaylable. Fiftlye I ſay they are a teſtymony to them that
dothe thē by the which mē may knowe that
he is the verye ſon̄e of god / is that not awaylable?
belyke Raſtell coūteth nothyng auaylable
but that which iuſtyfieth before God / 

he wyl ſay the ſon̄e is not auailable becauſe
it iuſtifieth not / fyer is not auaylable in his
yies becauſe it iuſtifyeth not. &amp;c.
                  Thē Raſtell ſaith that I make a wōders
worke with the ſcrypture / and allegeth certayne
textes that we ought to do good workes
(which I neuer denied) &amp; thervppō wolde
cōclude that workes ſaue &amp; iuſtifie / &amp; plaieth
me the bal luſtlye ouer the corde / but as god
wolde there ſtode a poſte ryght in the waye

rebounde ouer agayne backward / for in the
alleginge of his purpoſe Paul ſayeth Eph.

workes (which I neuer denyed) he bringeth
in that thynge which clene cōfuteth his opinion
for his opinion which in all places he
hath laboured to proue / is that we are ſaued
by good workes / but now marke what
he allegeth out of Paule by grace you be ſaued
by your faith: &amp; that is not of you / it is
the gyfte of god &amp; not of workes. For that
no man ſhulde glorifye hym ſelfe / here paule
ſaith plainly that oure ſaluacion is not of

workes: &amp; ſo hathe Raſtell caſt don that he
bilt before / &amp; maye be likened to a ſhrowde
cowe / whiche whan ſhe hath geuen a large
meſſe of milke torneth it don with her hele.
                  Thus haue I anſwered to as moche of
Raſtels treatice as I coulde get / yf there be
any more which may come to my handes I
ſhall do my diligence to diſcloſe his diſceyte
ſo that god geue me leue to kepe the courte
with him he ſhal wynne but lyttel / except he
conueye his balles more craftly / and yet the
truth to ſaye we playe not on euen hāde / for
I am in a maner as a mā boūde to a poſte / &amp;
can not ſo wel beſtowe me in my playe / as
yf I were at lybertye / for I maye not haue
ſuche bokes as are neceſſary for me / neither
yet pēne / ynke / ne paper / but onlye ſecretlye / ſo
that I am in cōtinual feare / bothe of the
Leuetenante &amp; of my keper / leſte they ſhulde
eſpye any ſuch thynge by me: &amp; therfore it is
lyttel meruel though the worke be on ꝑfeyte:
for whē ſoeuer I here the keyes ringe at the
dore / ſtrayte al muſte be conueyed out of the
waye (and then yf any notable thinge hadd
bene in my minde) it was cleane loſt / &amp;
therfore I beſeche the good reader
coūte it as a thynge borne out of
ceaſon / whiche for many cauſes
