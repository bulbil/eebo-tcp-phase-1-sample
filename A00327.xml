            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                matrymony is once celebrated, that there it can non other wyse be dyssoluyd but by ye death of one of the two partes, whiche were so ioyned togyther.
            Of thys mynd was Chrisostom, &amp; the olde latyn wrytars, and wyth oute doute the greate doctor Augustin, being confyrmed not only by the constytutions and ordynaunces of byshops, and wyth the authoryte also of the decretall lawes, but also approued, and allowed by the whole consentes of the schoolemen. But if so be, ye godly men haue alway thought

it good to alter and chaunge ther opynions, when it is for a better pourpose, and is also standynge wyth reasō, to make the lawes for to serue vs after the fashyon as we vse medicines, acording to the nature of the syknes and disease, wherwith man is payned: then let vs consyder, and waye, whyther it be expedient and proffytable that the selfe same thynge sholde be done in thys cause of matrimony: and if we do fynde it expedient and requysyt that it shold be, than let vs se whyther it be lawful, yea or naye, that some sorte of mariages sholde be vndone, not wyth oute a good ground, but for earnest causes, nor yet by euery man that wolde take vpon him, but by the gouernors of the churche, and lawfull iudges, and that

the same matrimony shulde so be dissolued, that both partes might mary againe to whom they 
                  •…
               lese, or that parte, whiche was not the cause of the breache of matrimonye. I am not ignoraunte, that there are many thynges, whereof, to make any doubte, or to brynge into question, were greate synne: as if we shoulde dispute, whither Christe were both god and man, whither he was borne withoute ye seede of man, whyther our soules do lyue after the death of ye body: and so, whyther that our bodyes shall be restored to lyfe agayne in tyme to come. For me are taught these thinges so playnelye by the authoritie of the holy scripture, &amp; by the whole consent of the holye churche, that it is a wycked and a very daungerous thynge, yea to

holde any dysputation therof, excepte it shoulde be our chaunce to haue to do with those, whiche are infidels. But yet for al that, I do not thynke, that that man shulde be vngentyllye sayd nay to, and spyghtfully cast of, whiche (as the weaknes of our humayne nature is) hauynge some doubte, paraduenture, of some of these thinges: doth open his mynd to those whiche ar learned, so that he mindeth none other thynge, but ye he might more firmely beleue that thynge, whiche he dyd not throughlye beleue before. But nowe let vs see, whither this matter, whereof we do now speake, be of that kynde, &amp; nature, ye or nay. Some thynges there are, whiche be so obseruyd &amp; kept by the aucthorite of the chur che, that accordinge as tyme and

nede sholde require, they maye be alteryd and chaunged. And as it is not lefull, to abrogate &amp; disanul the holy scripture, which is y• moste ryght rule of good lyfe, euē so it is the parte of a good and a wyse stuard, so for to vse it as ye maners of mē shal requyre, wher of we wyll speake more largely hereafter, myndynge nowe to go on with the matter which we haue in hand. Fyrst therfore of al, I do saye, that it perteyneth to ye godly charite of the churche, as mych as lyethe in it, to procure the helth of al men, and dilygently to comfort &amp; succour the weak &amp; diseased mē bers therof.

For Moyses doth wyshe, that he might be blotted forth of the boke of lyfe, And the Apostel Daule doth wyshe also that Chryste wolde make hym to be an anathem or curse for his bretheren.

            But Origen doth note in the example

of those byshops / that thei dyd permitte that thing vnto the wyues / whiche the apostle Paule with expressed words, semeth to prohibit and forbyd. Nether doth Origen say, that that man isafter the Iewysh sort, whiche doth forsake his wife for whoredome, but that man, whiche beynge waywarde, and harde to please, for euery lyghte cause, seketh to putte away his wyfe, as the Iews dyd. For, that man, whiche is of that Iewysh sort, and casteth with him selfe how he myghte go from hys wyfe / doth reason after this fast
                  •…
                on: Moses dyd permyt a man to put away his wyfe for anye foule thinge, and for example of a foule thinge, he putteth adulterye, it is lawfull therefore (sayeth 
                  •…
               e) for a man to put awaye his wyfe for

other foule thinges. This reason Orygen dooth shake of, denyeng that Moses dyd meane of aduou trye, when he said for a foul thing forsomuch as they dyd not vse to In the case of adulterye there wasno libell of dy uorsemente &amp; so no life. geue a libell of diuorsemente, for the cryme of aduoutrye, wher as they vsed to delyuer the wooman to them which shulde stone her to death. But by this foule thynge, wherof Moses spake, he dyd meane (saith Origen) ether some fait of corrupt manners, or deformitie of the body, wherwith the husbād were offended. That this was the mynd and opinion of Origen, his wordes folowynge do declare.
            After this (sayth he) the lorde doth not suffer any man to put awaye his wife for any otherfault, sauig only for the cause of fornication.
            And afterward he moueth āother

question, demandyng, whyther it be lawful for a man to put awaye his wyf, if she be a murtherer of fa

                   question moued of Origen, wher to be himself maketh aun swer. er or mother, if she be a witche, or a thefe, as well as he maye lawfully put her away if she be a who ar. And in thys question he standethe in doubt, perceuing on the won syde, that it were against the commaundement of god, so for to do, and on the other syde he dooth thynke it to be an vniuste and an vn natural thing, that the hosbād shold be constrained to bear those vices in hys wyfe, which are more greuous, and heynose, than whordom. But at the laste, sekinge how to wynde hym out of thys doubtful question he sayth, I do reason then after thys fashion and saye, bycause he dyd not commaunde this thig, as by y• way of aprecept

or commandemente, saing: let no man put his wyfe awaye but for fornication, but as one that wolde make ye matter more playn &amp; open sayde: who that dooth put awaye his wyfe, except it be for the cause of fornication / he maketh her an hatlot. I do thynk that Origen was of thys mynde / that the wemā is dryuē to be an advouterose person, in that, that she maye not be suffered to mary againe, althou ghe she be according to ryght, &amp; her nougty deseruing put from her hosband: but if she be so, the falte to be in her selfe, that she doth playe the whoar afterward, &amp; not, in her hosband, whiche hath putte her awaye. And alyghtel before, he made a similytude of Chryste, whyche dyd repudyate and caste of the syngagog, being a māquellar,

taking vnto him a new spouse which is the churche. The words of Orygen are these followynge: we must say (sayth he) that Chryst dyd not put away his fyrst wyfe, that is to saye (after the spiritual vnderstondynge) the fyrste Synagoge, to geeue example that he woulde do accordyng as the scriptur teacheth, which saith: whom God hath ioyned together let no man separate) but when his wife is an aduouterous woman, beynge corrupted of the aduouterouse ennemye, by whose counsell she soughte the death of her husbande, &amp;c. And a lyttell after he sayth, And Christe for the church sake, didde leaue and go from his father, with whome he was, what tyme he was in the forme of god and from his mother also. &amp;c.

Hitherto are the wordes of Orygen. Thou heareste in this place (gentyll reader) of a diuorsement, and after the dyuorsemente of a newe spouse, whereby, it is manyfeste / and open, that Orygen was of thys mynde playnelye, that after a man hath put awaye his wyfe for whoredome, he may marrye another wyfe. But where as he sayethe, that the bysshopps dydde agaynste the doctryne of the gospel, whiche permytted and gaue lycence for maryage, after dyuorsemente, he dooth meane of those men, whiche dydde putte a waye theyr wyues for other causes, as the Iewes dydde. And in the lyke manner, thou muste vnderstande that whiche he wryteth, where he saythe these wordes.

After the selfe same reason, as the woman is an aduoutrous person although she semeth to marry lefully, during the lyfe of her husbande, euen so the man, although he semeth lawfullye to take that woman to wife, which is so diuorsed from her husbande, yet dot

               e Origen speaketh of those, which domake diuorsementes for other causes, which Christ dyd not except, or for lyghte causes. And yet those matrimonis by mans law were not punished, yea they were taken as good and law full. But Origens reasoninge is, whether suche matrimonies be lawfull after the words of Christ

or no, namely, where as great offences did make the separation be twene the man and wife, as for attemptynge to poyson her husbād, or to do murther, and saith: Thou shalt examyn, whither he hathe a iuste excuse before god or naye. And yet the sayth, that who so putteth his wife away, doth geue occasion of adultery, whiche peraduenture, with god, shall be imputed, to the wyfe, and not to the hus bande, whiche dyd put her away. Tertulian doth apeare, not to be muche of a contrary mynd to Origen, in his fourth boke, whiche Tertulia

For the matrymony or ma riage whyche is not iustly dessolued, standeth in effect styll, &amp; that standyng styl in effect,) whiche is, contynnyng the matrymony, to mary to an other, is whordom. And so if Chryste vnder a conditi on dyd forbyd a man to put awai his wyfe, then dydde he not vtter lye forbydde hym. And that thynge whiche he hathe not wholye forbydden, he hath whollye permytted. The selfe same doctor with in fewe wordes after,

sayd: &amp; so the law of dyuorsment hath Chryst for the menteinar, &amp; defendar therof. Thou wylt saye Obiection. (peraduenture) that Tertulian is not to be admytted, forsomych as he went awaye from the churche. Howso euer he dyd, yet in thys matter he was not reprehended of the godly lerned men, whyche he sholde haue byn, if thys opinion had byn contrary to the mynde and iudgement of them that were in the treuth. Of the same mynde also, was on Polentius, a man (as The mynde of Polentius it apeareth of great grauite and of no lesse lerning, against whom saynte Augustine wrote. ii. bokes not in thys case, as thoughe he hadde byn one of the great hedds and masters of heretiques, but as one whych had bī in contentiō wt him, whose sentēce, mīd, &amp; iugmēt

he doth so refel and improue, that yet for that opinion, he doth laye no pointe of heresy to his charge. S. Ambrose also, whiche was a mā praised without al doubt, not ambrose per nuttethe the man to mari after diuors men: &amp; not the woman onely for his sound docryne, but also for his godly lyuynge, sayth that it is lawfull for a man to ma ry another wyfe, after he hath put awaye his firste wyfe for whoredome. And truly ther is nodoubt but that this byshop did practyse that thing in his flock, whiche he wrote to be iuste, and according to the lawe. For in thexposition whi che he made vpon the seuenth ch, of the first epistle, to the Corinthi ans, he sayde after this wyse: (and that the man do not put away his wyfe) you must vnderstand (saith he) except it be for the cryme of for nication. And therfore (sayth he)

the Apostel speakyng of the man dyd not put therto (yf he doth put her awaye, let hym continue syngell) as he dyd when he spake of the woman, bycause it is lawfull for a man to mary another wyfe yf his wyfe be a whoore, which he hath put awaye: for he is not in so streight bondage of the lawe, as y• woman. For the hed of the womā is the man. And the selfe same doctor sayde a lytle before. If she cā not lyue chaste (sayth he) because she wyl not stryue against ye flesh lette her be reconcyled to her husbande. For there is no such leaue gyuen to the woman, that she mai mary againe, although she dooth put away her husbande, for that he hath playde the whoremonger or hath forsaken his faith, or vnlawfullye hath desired the vse of

hys wyfe. The reasō wherof is bi cause the inferior hath not that same prerogatiue in the law, ouer the hedde, whyche the superior &amp; hed hath ouer the inferior, that if the man doth forsake the fayth, or wold contrary to godlynes peruerte the lawfull vse of his wyfe, yet can she nether marrye, to anye other, nor yet returne to him agayne. In this place where he saith that the inferyoure hath not that same priuylege, that the superyour hath, he semeth (although he sayeth not so openlye) to geue leue to the man to mary another wyfe: But / within fewe wordes after he permytteth the wyfe alsoo to take another housbande, althoughe her fyrste husband be alyue.
            For in his exposytyon vppon these wordes of Paule, (for a brother,

or a sister is not bounde in suche case) that is to saye saith he they ought not to receaue any ho not by matrymony whiche do disdayn &amp; hate the author &amp; maker of matrimony. For it is no good or fyrme matrimony, which is with oute the loue of god, by the whiche reason, the woman, whiche is putte away bycause she doth fear and loue God, dooeth not synne yf shee ioyne her selfe to an other husbande. For the coutempte, and hatred of God oure maker, doth loose and vndoo the bond of matrymonye, and settethe at lybertye / the partye whiche is soo put awaye so that he, or she so for taken maye with out blame and offence cople them selfe in matrymony againe with other. And the infydel person doth offend both

agaynst god, and the holy state of matrymony bycause he wold not in the loue and honor of god contynewe therin. And therfore, the faythe, and promyse of matrymony is not to be kept with hym, or her, whyche therfore forsaketh it and is gon from it, bycause he wold not here and beleue that the god of the Chrystyn people, whō theye do worship sholde be the author and maker of matrymony. For if Esdras dyd command the wyues, and hosbandes, whiche were infidells to be put awaye, that therfore god sholde be merciful, and not displesed if they tok other wyues or husbands of there owne nation (for they hade no sich commaundemnt that they sholde so put them awaye that thei shold take none other:) how mych more

yf an infidell person doth depart on his owne wyll, may the faythfull woman or man take in mariage one of their owne law? For that matrimonye ought not to be taken for matrimonye, nor imputed to them: which is without the law of god. Hytherto are the wor des of Ambrose. And here, I doo thinke that no man can quarell, that Ambrose dyd meane of that woman which by ignoraunce, did mary an infidell whom she beleued to be a christen mā, forsomuch as Daule doth approue and allow the coniunction, in mariage, yea of thos also, if the infidel doth consent / and is wyllyng to contynue with the faithful styll. For by that reason, if this ignoraūce was at the tyme of the contracte, then coulde she by no lawe continewe

with him styll, with whom at the first she coulde not make any such cōtract of matrimony. And truly The faith full maye not wytting by contracte matrimonye with the un faithfull but yf they were marted to gy ther not kno wng one the others sayth they oughte not afterward to go a fonde

It was noone of there owne wrytynges, but thrust in of some other corrupter of their workes▪ But now, if we wold dys cusse, and serche out the mynde, &amp; opinions of the late writars, (whi che do beare great swinge both in courte and in schole) we shall find, that there were amonge theym, whiche thoughte it lawfull, that matrimonye myght be dissolued, or at the leaste wyse, whyche denied not, but this matter was dispu table. Fyrst of all, Iohannes Andreas Iohannes Andreas determyneth, and decreeth, that matrimonye, before the man and the wooman doo lye togyther, maye be dyssoluyd, not onlye

yf either of them doo professe the rule of a monasticall lyfe, but also by the onely authoritie of the byshop of Rome. But yf they wyll graunt me, that this matrimonye, is a true matrimony, which is con tracted with the consente of bothe partes, hauynge and speakynge the wordes one to the other, whiche do partayne to that same contracte of matrimony, and that the contract is made betwene lawfull and meete persons, (suche as the law doth permit:) they must alsoo graunte, that the strength &amp; bond of matrimonye, dependeth of the lawe of god: It must follow then that ether the law of god doth not so take and vnderstonde matrimo ny as we do, or els, that the bishop of Rome hath power to vndo that whiche the law of god doth commaunde

and decree. Againe, the same Iohannes Andreas, techeth for a doctryne, that matrimonye which is ratefied, and ful finished by the carnal copulatiō of the mā, and the woman, can not by anye meanes be dissolued, for the proffe and confirmation of the whiche defence, which he maketh, I doo perceiue as yet no good reason or cause alledged. For the reasons, whiche Hostiensis, Augustin, and pope Leo do bryng for ye purpose, besyde, that they are but the opinions and myndes of men, they do also permytte against the doctrin of Christ and of Paule, that matrimony may be dissolued, and also / y• after the dissolution, &amp; losinge againe of the sayde matrimony, ye man and the womā separated / ma

must ether denye that same to be matrimonye, whiche is not confir med with the carnall copulation, or ells we must graūt yt matrimo ny may lawfully be dissolued. Or els / what god (I pray you) gaue this reuelation vnto these doctors that the profession of a monasticall lyfe, and the chaunge of religion, which is of the ordinance of man doth lawfully depart man &amp; wyfe / yea, although yt ether of thē wold stand in the denial therof, &amp; were not wyllyng to go a sonder. Yea (wyl they say) we do meane yt matrimony which is but ratefyed &amp; agreed vpō betwen the partes, not that which is made perfect, &amp; ful ended by carnal copulatiō. Yf it be so, wher, and when dyd god euer teche them, y• heresy should de parte mā &amp; wyfe, yea after it were

Now, let euery man be content, and not tale streyghtwaye into a rage and cry out vpon heauen and yearth, and saye: Thys man doth goo about to breake the decrese of the church. For thervnto I do answere, that I do go about no syche thing (as I haue protestyd befor) but only by the waye of dysputati on to reason the matter. Then let

(yea Peter him selfe) haue &amp; hath ordeyned, and forsomoche as there be some doctours, whiche make a question and a dout of it, whyther he may ordeyn and decre any thynge agaynste the doctryne of the gospell, not altogether deni enge but that he maye after a certayne fashion, do it, although not cleane disanullynge the doctryne therof / that is to say / either by interpretation, or elles by restraynynge, or enlargynge of his wordes (as Daule dyd when he sayde, I not the lord, by permission, &amp; not of commaundemente doo. &amp;c.) for what cause do they more bind him in this case, that he cannot do the lyke, as he may in other thinges, which are more great wherin he is permitted to do what he wyll?
            Forsoth as concernyng matrimony, Ihon Andrea, which is a gret

author amonge the lawyers. affirmeth that the bysshop of Rome may decre, and ordeyn, that by the seconde contracte of matrimonye, the first maye be made voyde, soo farre as the first was not consum mate, lykewise as it is vndone, &amp; made voyde, by entering into religion. And of this mans mynde is Panormitanus, asye rede in their commentaries, wrytten vpon the chapter, Quoduotis / in the tytell. Deuoto &amp; uoti redemptione. In the syxt boke, and in the chapter, Expublico, in the title, Deconuersi one coniugatorum. In the actes of the apostles we do reede, that in a certayne solemne counsell, it was decreed and published, that as ma ny, as were admitted from the infi delitie of the heathen into the christian flocke, should absteyne from

meates offred vp to ydols, frome strangled beastes, from blode, and from whoredom. This can not be called a conciliable or pryuate con gregation, where so great a nōber was, neither can it be called a coū
               sell without a heade, where Deter hym selfe was presente. And yet, that whiche was at yt tyme decreed, is gon so farre, &amp; so longe time owt of vse, that now who yt wolde abhorre to eate of a strangled hen, or of podynges which ar made of The decres of the apo stles chaun ged, &amp; for what intent it was made bloude, men woulde take hym to be a ryght Iewe. And yet do not I blemysh the auctoritie of the Apostels, but onely I do excuse the thynge done by them at that coun sell to be ordeyned for a tyme, for the pacifienge of the myndes of the Iewes. The Apostle Paul for byddeth that a nouyce in the faith

whiche is newe come therto or els a feyghter. or a dronkatde, should be made a bishop. But at this dat Paules con stitution we dose, that the byshop of Rome doth make a chylde a byshop, whi che was borne but yesterday, yea, and yt it pleaseth hym, of a pirate and a thefe, which robbeth vppon the sea, he wyll make a byshop also, beyng nothyng a feard of Dau les constitution. Furthermore, it was longe or the churche dyd determyne, Transubstā tiation not beleuedofthe prymytyue churche. that transubstantiation was in the bread of the aulter. For it was sufficient many yeares, yt a man did but beleue that the bodye of Christ was vnder the consecrated breade, wone way or other soo that they beleued that he was there. But afterwarde vpon a far ther respecte they determyned otherwyse thereof. The tyme harhe

byn, when they wexe not taken for heretiques which beleued that the holy ghost dyd procede only from the father, and I am not certayne, whither the moost part of the chri stians dyd in the prymytyue churche so beleue. But when they had wayed the matter well, the church dyd defyne that waye, whiche we nowe do followe. The lyke thing The concep tiō of the 
                     〈◊〉
                   gin was aboute the conception of the blessed vyrgyn. But whyther the churche dyd at the fyrst determyne and iudge that man, whych would doubt therof, that he shuld be taken for an heretyque or nay / I can not tell very well, although there are some, whiche do affyrme that it was so concluded in y• coun sell holden at Basyll. And here a gayne 
                  •…
               iseth a double doubte,

whyther al the actes of that counsell do stand or nay, and farther wt what wordes, and for what pourpose / this case was determined. If it were then defyned to be as an actycle of our fayth, what shal become of the fryar Dominikes, of whome many be yet styll of the cō
               trarye opinion. There are manye suche lyke matters as this is. For there was none of them, which wer the very olde wrytars, that durste pronounce openly / that the holye ghost was of one substance wt the father, &amp; ye son, no not thē when the question about the sonne, was so contentiously handled al ye world ouer. And that more is, in ye psalme of prayse geuynge, whiche the churche beganne to synge after y• Arryans were expulsed, where as is attributed to the sonne, that he

is the lyght, of lyght, and perfect god of perfect god, the same is not ther / with open and playne wordes ascribed to the holy ghost. But now we are bolde to say, that The holy gh oste is of one substaunce with the fa ther and the sonne. the holy ghost is of one substance with the father and the sonne, and perfecte god of the father, whiche is very god, and of the sonne whi che is very god.

It is suffi cient that it be so farre forth, void of error, that it doeth houlde and kepe the chief pointes of our faith and christen religion. For it maye happe that the churche shall erre in the number, wherby they shuld

and yet this shamefull contracte, can not be vndone, yea (whiche is a more straunge matter) they doo make of this fylthy, and vngodly contracte an holy sacrament. For / our common dysputations, whyche are of mutuall consent, of the wordes perteynynge to the presēt tyme of matrimony fullye confyrmed, and not confyrmed, they be but the myndes and interpretations of men, and not the verye expresse wordes of god.

And forsomyche as nether Chryste, nor Paule do not requyre nor wyll, that he shal lyue continent and chaste, whyche can not, for what cause sholde they be sayde to be noughtye persons, whyche nether can do it, nor yet haue bounde them by any vowe therto? Thys is the fault of the body, not of the mynde. And wher fore is he compelled to suffer ponyshment, which hath committed none offence? Yea, and is in gret dysquyetnes and affliction al redy.

But where as some do saye. that it is comprehended vnder the sacramente of orders,

that is no more, but to shewe that thou haste some thing to say, whē thou woldest apere to haue some answer to make, thoughe it were neuer so slender, as though the li

                woulde haue beaten it into theyr eares, sayinge, yea, and crieng out after this wyse. Matrimonye is wone of the seuen Sacramentes of the church, Uyrgynyte is not. Neyther doo I thynke that S. Hierome woulde haue stomacked the matter so muche, agaynst those, whyche woulde marry anye oftener than wonse, yf it hadde byn knowen, that wedlocke had byn wone of the seuen sacramentes.
            But for what pourpose, doo I speake all these wordes, sythe that Durandus dooethe confesse, that theye, whyche weare

                the latter wryttars vppon dyuynytye, weare the fyrste, whyche in theyr writings dyd begyn

to name matrimonye, for to be amonge those, which properlye are called the sacramentes of the chur che. But, where as the oulde wryters, folowynge Daule, do otherwhyle call matrimony a sacramēt, I do thynke them to be of y• mind that in the copelynge together of man and wife, because it is a most sure and fast bonde of amyte and frendshyp, is represented vnto vs a certayne fygure, and ymage of Christ, ioynynge his spouse vnto hymselfe, whiche is the church.
            And truelye, matrimonye beynge well kept, is a very godly, and an holy thyng. Yea and also that, the whyche of it selfe is not holy, may be a type / and a fygur of an holye thynge, as was Bethsabe the wyf of Uria taken from hym, and ioyned to Dauyd, as was the aduou

try of Oseas the prophet, the fable also of Sampson and Dalila / as Hierom doth manifestly affirme. And againe it is not requisit and necessarye, that the fygure shulde be in all pointes / lyke vnto whether the fygure of a thynge muste in al poyntes be lyke the thig fygured the thinge figured. For otherwyse should it be no sacramente, when a man fortuneth to haue a barren wyfe, or when a woman is combered with a dronken husbād an euyl liuer, and a dysar. And although we shoulde graunte, that matrimonye is a very sacramente indede, yet shal it be no sacramēt, where an oulde man doth marrye an oulde woman, a dronken man, a dronken womā, which the churche, for al that, wil haue to be a sacramente. A thousande suche lyke examples, myght be broght forth, in the which the image of the heuenly,

and spiritual matrimonye sholde not aunswere in al poyntes to the corporall matrimonye. Neither dooth the sacramente of Baptyme susteyne any detrymēte wherin the spiritual &amp; corporal mo trymony do

                or wronge, althoughe some afterwarde be of an vncleane, and vnwashed lyfe, nor yet dooth it followe, that wedlocke is no sacrament, although that maried folke be often tymes noughty lyuars. For then, the dyuorse, whiche we do so lyghtly permyt for such cau ses; shuld preiudicate the sacrament of Christ. Againe, we do separate oftentymes, the man from the wyfe, where as Christ doothe alwaye cleaue vnto his spouse.
            And fynally, matrimony should
                  •…
                not be dissolued, no, not with deth yf we wyll haue the fygur answer to the thing figured in al points.

Yea, if we wyll so narrowly loke vpon the type, Origen sayth, that Chryste dyd dymysse the sinagog from hym, bycause she was a mur therat of her hosbonde, when she sayde: Take hym: Take hym, and crucifye hym, and puttyng awaye the same synagoge he ioyned the churche to hym for his spouse.
            After thys image, and symylitude a man maye put awaye his wyfe whiche hath soughte the death of her hosbond, and maye mary an other woman, more mete for hym. And as tochinge the congruency with what mynd mary ed foles oug ht to go toge ther of the mystery, it is ynough that alwaye won man doth ioyne hym selfe to won womā, with this mid and full purpose, that ther sholde be neuer any separatiō betwen thē which among som is a perpetuall matrimony. Truly, I do meruail y• wher as so many owld writars

in the greke and latin tonge haue ser chyd to fynde oute the causes wherfore that matrimony shulde be indyssoluble, that no such reason coulde fal into their heads, as is into ours, y• matrimony sholde neuer be losed agayne, after it is wonse made and done. There is no man whiche doth contract matrimony, but is of that mynd, that he woulde that it should continue whole, durynge his lyfe, neuer to be dissolued. For no man at that tyme, when he doth marrye / wyll thinke on anye separation or dyuorse. But yt so be, it doth so chaū ce afterwarde, vpon any necessary cause (accordynge to the fashion of the worlde) what hurt (I praye you) is done to the sacramente, yf that remedy be founde for theym, whiche can not lyue chaste? For

lykewyse as a priuiledge graunted to a fewe, dooth not dysanull the lawe which is made generally to all men, so thoughe some be vnlockye in mariage, and manye do offende, what is the sacrament the worse? Fynally, it shal follow that either it was no sacramente in the oulde lawe, or els it oughte not to be vndone, and that specyally, forsomuch as in the peryls &amp; daunger of murther, we maye remedye the party which is in fear, by the waye of our separation, and dyuorse. Chrysostom doth shewe Chrysostome two causes, wherefore the Iewes myght put away theyr wyues, ge The firste cause whye thee Iewes were permit ted to put a waye theyr wyues uynge to them a lybel of dyuorse. They are suffred to putte awaye theyr wyues (saith he) lest bearing hatred vnto them, they sholde seke theyr death, Shuld then the wickednes

of the wycked persons among the Iewes, be commodiose and proffytable vnto them, &amp; not aswel the innocēcy of the hosbond amonge vs, which ar christen mē, be helpe to hym whych is innocēt, and without faulte? The man is commaunded (sayth Chrisostom) The cause

                   geue to the wyfe to giue to the woman a lybell of dyuorse, that he myght not afterwarde commande her to com to hi agayne, whom he had wonse caste of, to auoyde the confusion, and often commyttyng of adulterys. But truly thys cause is not rekened for any barre to vs, but that we maye make it lawfull to thee hosbond to take his wyfe agayne whome he hath wonse put awaie. And agayne Christome doth say, that the cause, whye a manne myghte caste of hys wyfe, beinge

a whoar, then, and no wis al won, that they sholde not euery where commyt fornication and adultery won with the others wyues. If then, that same be a very trewe cause, in dede, wherfore amonge vs chrystē men is no man compelled to put from hym hys wyfe, when she is a whoar, but is playnly forbydden &amp; restrayned frō puttynge her awaye, except he dothe entende al hys lyfe after to be made lyke a man, whyche hathe loste the vse of nature. Innocentius the thirde in the chapter, Quanto, whiche we haue alledged before, dothe shewe thys reason, wherfore the wyfe of a man, whych is fallen into heresy maye not take another hosbonde. Bycause (saythe he) if they do hate there wyues, or ells the one of

               h an other, if in syche a case as this is, they myght be dymyssed, and delyueryd or ther wyues, they wolde make asthoughe thei were in some heresy, that theye myghte quyckly be departed, and mary agayne. The lycke reason is rehersyd in the glose made vpon y• chap ter: Dixit dominus, in the thre and thirty cause, and the fyrste question, whiche glose we alleged forth of Hyerom, a lyghtel before. But truly if we do admyt this cause to be good, then may not that womā he maryed agayn, which by error was maried to Peter, whom she toke for to be Ihon / or ells was maried vnto a seruaūt, whom she thought hadd byn a freman, least when she were in mynde to be departed from her hosbōd she wold

subornate, or feyn sych causes, whi che were not trewe: how be it the chapter whiche is recyted in thee glose doth not seme to make mich for the pourpose of Innocentius. For his meanīg is of the hosbond which doth feyn him selfe to be an heretique, that he myght fray hys wyfe from him, and as sone as she is maryed to an other man, feyne hym selfe agayne that he is amen dyd and torned from his heresye: So myght the man feyn him selfe to be a seruant, whyche wold seke to dryue hys wyfe away from hī. And the lyke may be sayd agaīste oure dyuorsments and separatyons, that the hosbond wyl fordge and deuyse somme faulte, whose wyfe doth not please hym at home that he myghte by that meanes thruste her forthe▪ of hys doars,

kyng it a sufficient greate reward of hys falset, &amp; crafty dissemlynge if he maye be, but somich as wyth oute the syght of hys wyfe in hys house, whō he doth hate. Hytherto haue I shewed the causes, for the whyche dyuorsment / was not permytted. Now, if ye wyl, let vs examin the places of Paul, whēse oure bysshops do seme to fetche, that they do make so great a dyffyculty &amp; hardnes in dyssoluinge of matrymony, and vndoinge of maryages. Paul, in the seuenth

she is bound vnto ye law, but when her hosbond is dede, she is losed from the lawe of the man: And therfore, so longe as the man lyueth, she shall be called an adulteros womā if she be with an other man. But if her h

               bond be dede, she is set at lyberty from the lawe of the man, that she shall not be an adulteros person, althoughe she taketh an other mā. Paul in this place doth not treat of dyuorsmēt or separation betwen man &amp; wyfe, but he maketh a similytude vnto the Iewes, which is taken out of ther owne lawe, wherby he might teach and perswad them, that the law of Moses, being taken away by the law of thee ghospell, theye are no lengar bounde to the obser uation of the ceremonis of y• law, syth that they haue taken to them a new spous, whych is Chryst.

For thus the parable of the theefe / whiche breaketh into the house by nyght, the parable of the mony whiche is due and owynge to the vsurar, the parable of the wicked &amp; noughtye stuarde, the parable of the vyne, and the braunches thereof, the parable of the chyldren, syngynge in the market place, and such other innumerable, shoulde seeme very fonde, if it shulde be examyned &amp; tryed by this streighte rule, to haue all poyntes agre. It is sufficient, that they do declare, &amp; make open the thynge, wherefore they be applyed. It is the maner and fashyon of Paul, to drawe, &amp; wrynge what so euer he can by any

meanes, to serue for the gospel after a godly crafte and subtylte, while he doth turne him selfe into all thinges, that he may wynne all men vnto Christe. But our men, nowe a days, are nothing lyke vn to Paule, whiche do turne theym selues into al things, that by that crafte and polyeye, they maye call men awaye frome Christe, and so come to great ryches and promotions. How be it, yf we wyll take these wordes of Daule as they do lye, and sounde, no man shall put awaye his wyfe, althoughe shee dooth playe the whore. For he ma keth in this place, noo manner of exception. Again / Paule shal not seme aptly to alledge the lawe of Moses vnto the Iews, yf they do take his wordes after that fashiō, forsomuche, as the lawe doothe

Nether yet dothe Paul in thys place reason the cause of dyuors, but exhor teth accordyng to the state of thos tymes, that theye, whiche are free from maryage, and specyally wydowes (for in thys place he dothe speake of them) shold abstein frō mariage, that they sholde be thee more fre, from the busynes of thee worlde / whyche was then a wycked, and an idolatrose worlde, and coulde not choose, if they dyd marie, but muste nedes ioyn them selfe in affynite with the wicked &amp; vngodly.

If Fabiola had sayd thus muche or suche lyke words vnto Paule, I thynke she shoulde haue found more humanite / and gentlenes in hym, than she dyd in that byshop, (what soeuer he was) which didde put an innocent &amp; a fautles yong woman, to such an open shame &amp; punyshment, as thoughe she had poisoned her mother, &amp; specially, forsomiche as she did not take an other husbonde in contempte of the bysshops lawe / but thorowe symplycytye, and lacke of wysedom.

But if so be any man wyll say that Paule doth speke in this place as tochynge the cause of adultery Paule i'this place meneth not the cause of adulterye / for what cause dyd he not make that same exception, whiche the lorde dyd make, yea wherfore dyd he adde more words vnto the thynge than the lorde dyd, in that he byddethe the woman to contynewe vnmaryed / wherfore dothe he forbyd ye man to put away hys wyfe, whom Chryst permytted so to do, if she were an adulteros woman. I do not speake these words to thentent, that we sholde haue a gappe made open, to often dyuorsmēts and separations of maryed persons.
