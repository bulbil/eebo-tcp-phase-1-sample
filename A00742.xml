            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            A preface to the Chriſtian
Reader.
            
               I ENTRED no ſooner
into meditation of ſome
preface vnto the preſent
booke, but forthwith Maiſter
Dudley Fenner, of
moſt happy and worthie memorie, ſtood before
me. In whoſe remēbrance, as his death
renued my grief: ſo it cōforted me, that after
three yeares, as it were the third day, in
one of the ſame coūtrie of Kent, in the ſame
argument of laying down the whole body of
the holy doctrine of God, in the ſame methode
and memorielike handling of it, God
had as it were, raiſed him vp againe from
the dead, for ſupply of ſome of that worthy
ſeruice, vnto his Church, which he, if the
Lord had added yeares vnto his life, would
manifoldly haue performed. For cōſidering
the forreſtlike largeneſſe of matter it handleth
and ſmal rowme the ſame is imparked,
and the good order euery doctrine ſtandeth

in before the reader, ranged with others either
going before &amp; cōming after, as ſuperiours
and inferiours, or ſiding it and walking
hand in hand, as ſiſters &amp; cōpanions:
it ſeemed to me, that this treatiſe was like to
be a ſeed, that by the hand of the printer being
caſt vpon the field of our coūtrie, might
in good time bring vs home an harueſt,
that might yeeld honor to God, and edification
to his Church, which is the principall:
and in the ſecond place ſome honeſt credit,
not altogether to be deſpiſed, vnto this our
countrie of Kent, whilſt it going before the
moſt of other the Shires &amp; Counties of the
Land in bleſsings of outward fruitefulneſſe
and wealth, ſhould not be found behinde all
others, in the fruits of the Spirit, wherwith
mens hearts, yea the Lord himſelf (after a
ſort) is reioyced.I

                  . 9. And in it me thought I
ſawe ſome gratious bluſh and good reſemblance
of the wiſdome, which Solomon ſpeaketh
of. For as by writing ſhee lifteth vp
her voice,
               Prov. 8. ſo by conuenient, orderly &amp; eaſie
maner of hādling the doctrines of God, ſhe
ſtandeth in the toppe of the higheſt

places, where all wayfaring men that are
ſtrangers in our countrie, taking their voyage
towards mount Sion, may vnderſtande
what is ſaid vnto them. From thence ſhee
ſteppeth to ſet her ſelf in the place or
mother of wayes:
               Ezech. 2▪
                wher one way cutting
it ſelfe into many, greatly hazardeth the
wayfaring man, vnleſſe there be one, as it
were, with the finger to point vnto him,
which is the right and ready way. Approching
vnto the citie of the heauenlie Ieruſalem,
from whence ſoeuer he cometh Eaſt,
Weſt, North or South, and to whatſoeuer of
the twelue gates of the twelue tribes of our
Land: ſhe is there alſo ready at the gate,
in the mouth of the Citie, to tell him,
what ſtreat he ſhall enter, on what hande to
turne, what lane to goe down. That done ſhe
taketh the winges of the morning, and fearing
the frailty of men, leaſt they ſhould not
ſee their happineſſe, when it is before them,
or that they ſhould not diſcerne of it, when
they touch it, or ſtumble vpon it: ſhe ſetteth
her ſelfe euen at the very dore that openeth
to the full and perfect poſſeſsion of the

promiſed felicity, ſaying, heere is the place
you ſeeke after, enter it. This cōmendation,
notwithſtanding that incōparably it doeth
agree to the eternall ſonne of God, in his
own, and in his Propheticall, and Apostolicall
ministerie, as that which is the perfect
Iethro of our voyage from Th'aegipt of this
world vnto the Lande of the heauenly Canaan:
yet may it alſo not vnfitlie, in ſome
meaſure, more or leſſe, be ſpoken of the holy
labours in this kinde: which by deſcription
of the whole doctrine of God, frō the foundation
vnto the loouer thereof, take vs by
hande, and entring vs into the way of God,
lead vs as it were to all the ſtandinges and
Camping places of the children of God, in
the wilderneſſe of this world, vntill hauing
caſt away, either weapons or walking ſtaues,
we ſhall ſet vs downe in th'endles peace and
reſt of our God. A labour as at no time vnſeaſonable,
and in no place vnworthy of a
good welcome: ſo in theſe dayes, and eſpecially
in our countrie, it is worthy, of all good
entertainment. For beſide that there are to
many ſectes and ſchiſmes: there are alſo diuerſities

of iudgments, in one and the ſame
ſort, both which be in danger, the former of
ſchiſmes to grow to hereſies, the latter from
ſome difference of iudgement, to bee ſorted
and ſected altogether, if by ſuch treatiſes as
this, which ſhortlie, and, as it were vnder
one ſight, lay forth the ſound doctrine of all
the maine, &amp; meane, principall, and ſecondarie
pointes of our moſt holy faith, the
iudgment of men be not either called home,
where it is broken out, or ſtayed where a
breach is begun. And albeit th'excellent vſe
hereof may clearly appeare to euery one that
hath but halfe an eye to looke with: yet is
there that oppoſition in the world against
all good endeuours of the ſeruauntes of the
God of heauen, that this alſo is not vnlike to
fall into ſome riflers hands, which will doe
the vttermoſt of his wretched endeuour, to
deſpoile it of the garmentes of comelines,
whereby the Lorde would ſet it in the good
grace &amp; well liking of his children. If (happelie)
it be ſaid, that it is therefore fruitles,
becauſe it is a doing of a thing that is alreadie
done, by a worthy, workeman of the Lord

Maiſter Dudley Fenner, it were ſufficient
anſwere, that the ſame is made Engliſh,
which before was Latine, and brought into
the artificers ſhop, which was before in the
ſtudies &amp; cloſets of the learned alone, which
deſerueth praiſe at the handes of a thankful
Reader. It is more then ſufficient aunſwere,
that he hath brought Mr 
               Fenners booke,
for helpe of memorie, into a great deale
ſmaller rowme. But I am and haue bene of
that acquaintāce &amp; priuitie with the Gentlemen
theſe many years, that I am able before
God, and in trueth to profeſſe, that before
he euer ſawe M. Fenners booke, he had
written &amp; finiſhed this; with ſuch grace, as
I, louing him before, did euer ſithence reuerence
him, for the graces of God beſtowed
vpon him. And therefore as the Lord gaue
Maiſter Fenner the honour to be firſt; ſo he
would not let him haue it ſo farre, as to be
alone. And notwithſtāding th'authors both
modestie, and wiſedome is ſuch, as he would
not haue paſſed by the aduantage of a further
garniſhment of his worke, by M. Fenners
labours: yet whoſoeuer ſhall peruſe

the booke diligentlie, ſhall eaſilie perceaue,
that hee hath for the matter, a ſtock of his
own, and for the forme &amp; maner of deliuerie
of it, art and cunning of his own, to haue
finiſhed ſome commendable worke in this
kind, if he had had no ſuch paterne before
his eyes. Which beeing well conſidered, will
ſtop the mouth of ſome others, which ſnatching
vp the wiſe Prouerbs, as of a man not
medling beyond his ſlipper: and a
Carpenter not dealing but with his
chippes: will bee ready, fooliſhlie to throw
them, they know not where, nor at whome.
And for my parte, I am of that iudgement,
that it is ſo farre from beeing vnmeet for a
Gentleman of the Innes of the Court, to
deale thus in theſe holy ſtudies; that I could
wiſh of the Lorde, that the Noble men of
the Court it ſelfe, and all others whoſe wits
are either by nature, or education more
pregnant, would fine &amp; file them vpon ſuch
endeuours as theſe are. So ſhould they fitt
themſelues not only to paſſe frō the Princes
Court into the Lordes owne Court, there to
raigne for euermore; but ſhould able themſelues

ten thouſand times better to all honorable
ſeruices of their Prince, &amp; Countrie,
in a wiſer and more politique gouernment
of the comon wealth, then Machiauel that
curſed helhound can furniſh thē of. For beſides
many notable draughts of policie, here
and there ſcattered throughout the whole
Scripture, eſpecially the ſtorie: that one
booke of the Prouerbes, as it were the Lords
owne Politickes, is able to yeelde more ſound
precepts of ſure &amp; ſafe gouernement, then,
I will not ſaye Machiauell, but then all
the Machiauels in the worlde, when they
ſhall haue met vpon their bench, and ſhall
haue beaten out their braines about that
conſultation. And if it be here aſked, what
are you, or who are you, whoſe iudgment in
this behalfe the reader ſhould ſo greatly regard.
Peraduenture the reader may be ſuch
a one, as if I were a mā of ſome marke, with
my word I ſhould carie him away, although
I brought no reaſon: if of no note at all, hee
would not beleeue mee, although I ſhould
come vpon him with neuer ſo good reaſon.
Therefore concealing my name, in a word I

anſwere firſt out of Moſes, for whom, when
Ioſhua was ielous leaſt the gift of Propheſie,
&amp; of the declaratiō of the will of God being
common, Moſes his Maiſter ſhould be leſſe
eſtemed: he anſwered, would to God that
all the Lords people were Prophets,
               Num. 11.
               why leſt the Lorde ſhould beſtow his
Spirit vpon them. Example hereof we
haue in Ezechias raigne, one of the godliest
and moſt renowned Kings that euer raigned,
whoſe gouernement was alſo accōpanied
with as much glorie and good ſucceſſe,
both at home, and abroad during the whole
time of his raigne, as any king whatſoeuer,
Dauid only excepted. Nay I needed not, in
euery reſpect, to haue excepted Dauid, who
met with more croſſe handes of the Lord in
his Sonnes and ſubiects, then euer did Ezechias.
And of him to his cōmendation that
ſhall neuer die, it is written, that his Courtiers
gathered,Pro. 25. 
                     •
                  
                and ſuted diuers of: Solomons
Prouerbs, in that Prophetical order
wherein nowe they are left vnto vs by the
holy Ghost. And vnles Courtiers will iudge
thēſelues vnworthy of the kingdome of heauen,

there is no cauſe, why they ſhould eſteme
it to baſe or to vnworthie a thing for them
to be occupied in: ſeeing Dauid, Solomō
               
and Ezechias, the moſt famous Kinges
that euer liued, haue no one thing ſo precious,
to garniſhe and ſet foorth their Royall
Crowne with, as that their handes beeing
taught of God to write ſome thing to his
praiſe, &amp; edification of his people, the ſame
as a diamond in their princelie Diademes
remaineth to all poſteritie. Saul alſo, albeit
a wicked man, yet beeing purpoſed of God
to the Kingdome, had this as a principall
meanes, to hide from the eyes of the people,
the baſeneſſe of his birth, and homelines of
his education: that hee was for ſome ſmall
time graced of the Lord with a gift of Pro
phetie, wherewith beeing ennobled, he was
ſo prepared for the kingdome. But I am aſhamed
of the iniquitie of theſe times, that
ſhould driue to the proofe of that, whiche
prophane and heathniſh mē, in the dim &amp;
darke ſight of their naturall reaſon, haue
both ſeene and profeſſed, that theſe cōmon
wealthes were moſt happie, where either

Philoſophers were Kinges, or Kinges Philoſophers.
And if Scepters were wel guided,
when men ſtoode at the ſterne of common
wealthes, that ſtirred them by direction of
that ſhadowe and carcaſe of Philoſophie,
that was to be had in their bookes: O howe
happilie ſhould they bee menaged, if their
courſe were ſet at the preſcript and cōmand
of the word of God, which is the ladie miſtres
of all true wiſedome or philoſophie. But
I ſee there would be no end if I ſhould ſet my
ſelf to anſwere whatſoeuer the crooked wits
of wrangling companions might obiect.
And therfore aſſured of the fruitfulneſſe
of the booke in it ſelfe, I commend the profite
and ſucces therof to the bleſsing of God:
who only can direct the heartes and handes
of men to lay houlde, and make vſe of it, aſwell
for th'increaſe of their knowledge, as
for the prouoking of them to like endeuours.

                     The tenth commaundment.
                     So I interprete it for theſe reaſons following.
                     1 The playne euidence of the wordes Thou ſhalt not couet thy neighbours houſe.
                     
                     2 By conference of the reſt of the commaundments, Honor thy Father and thy Mother: Thou ſhalt not kill: Thou ſhalt not cemmit adultorie: thou ſhalt not ſteale: Thou ſhalt not beare falſe witnes: which haue (all of them) a cōmon and familiar vnderſtanding, ſuch as euerie man at the firſt hearing doeth conceyue. 3 The particular inſtances. Thy neighbours houſe, wyfe, manſeruant, maydeſeruant, oxe, aſſe, or anie thing that is his, declare manifeſtly the good thinges of ones perſon to be the proper ſubiect of this cōmandement. For which cauſe Exod. 20. 17. the wyfe of our neighbour (his moſt precious poſſeſſion, prou. 19. 14) commeth not in the firſt place but is ſet in ye middeſt of other poſſeſſions, that the verie marſhaling of the wordes it might appeare that this commandement reacheth not to vncleannes. 4 The order of the commandements, going by degrees from the greater to ye leſſe, and ſo cōtinually falling til you come to this ſumme of Coueting, which is the roote of all the reſt, 1. Tim. 6. 10. 5 It differeth in nature from the two laſt that went before. Whereof one is bent againſt iniurie and wronge, the other againſt falſitie and deceipt. And this commeth not ſo farre as eyther of them both. Laſtlie, adde herevnto that whiche I hould as a certaine grounde, that the corruption both of nature &amp; deſire is forbidden in euerie one. For the Law of God, and conſequenthe euerie commandement thereof, being ſpirituall, Rom. 7. 14. (according to the nature of him that gaue it, Iohn 4 24. Heb 4. 12. 13.) muſt needes reach to all the faculties and powers of the whole man, yea and to his very nature. So as in euery commandement the roote it ſelfe and ſtumpe of that ſinne, togither with all the braunches comming from it, are there condemned. Which ſeeing all men agree, in dueties of the firſt table, the ſame reaſon and proportion earieth it to thoſe of the ſeconde alſo. And that may further appeare by our Sauiour Chriſtes interpretation of the ſeuenth commandement, extending it to all kinde of luſt, Mat. 5. 28. So doeth the Apoſtle Iames the ſixt commaundement, ſetting it foorth by the three degrees thereof lusting, eagerly affecting, (when the heart is wholy poſſeſſed with it) and laſtly fighting and warring Iames 4. 2. As for the ſaying of Paul, Rom. 7. 7. I had not known lust, except the Law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not luſt, I take it (vnder reformation of better iudgment) to be meant not of any one Commandment in particuler, but of the whole puritie (that way) which the Lawe of God thoroughout requireth. And that aſwell in the duties to God, as to our brethren. Which the Apoſtle ſoundly gathereth to bee commaunded in the Law, becauſe the Law is ſpirituall. And this hee ſaith (verſe 9) came and was, as it were, a new commaundement vnto him, when he vnderſtood the whole Law to be ſpirituall and to reach to the luſt and deſire of the heart. which in the darkenes of his phariſaiſme hee had not learned. Becauſe this expoſition of the tenth Commaundement, doth vary from that which is generally receaued, I haue opened my reaſons the more at large. Let the learned Iudge.

               HEtherto of the partes of
righteouſneſſe: The ſeuerall
kindes followe.
               Righteouſnes is
                     Phil. 3. 9. Rom. 9. 30. 31, 32. &amp; 10. 3, 4, 5, 6. Gal. 3. 12. The firſt, requiring righteouſneſſe from our ſelues, or by our own works, &amp; propounding life euerlaſting if we doe it, is called the Law, or the couenant of workes, Rom. 10. 5. Gal. 3. 12. The other, ſending vs to Chriſte, and propounding life euerlaſting through him, if wee beleeue in him, is called the couenant of grace, Rom. 10. 4. Gal. 3. 13, 14. Which is two fould, according to the diuerſe diſpenſation of the times before and ſince his comming. The couenant of grace before his comming in the fleſhe (being thorough Chriſt to come) was termed the old Teſtament, Heb. 8. 13. and the publiſhing thereof, the promiſe, Acts 13. 32. Gal. 3. 17. 18. The ſame couenant ſince his comming (beeing thorough Chriſt already come) is termed the new Teſtament, Ierem. 31. 31, 32, 33, 34. and the publiſhing thereof, the Goſpell, Acts 13. 32. Marc. 1. 1.
                     The Lawe beeing impoſſible for vs in this our corrupt eſtate, to performe, Rom. 8 3. ſerueth not at all to iuſtifie, Gal. 3. 10, 11, 21, 22. But 1. to ſhewe and diſcouer ſinne, Rom. 3. 20. &amp; 7. 7. 2. Through the corruption of our nature to encreaſe ſinne, Rom. 7. 8, 9, 10, 11. 3. To pronounce againſt vs iudgement and condemnation due vnto ſinne, Rom. 3 19. and thereby to driue vs vnto Chriſt, Rom. 10. 4. Gal. 3. 22. 23, 24.
                     To the regenerate it further ſerueth. 1. As a light to direct vs, Pſal. 119 105. 2. As a prick to incite vs, becauſe of Gods commandment. 3. To frame vs to humilitie, ſeeing thereby how farre we are from fulfilling it.
                     The difference betweene the Lawe and the Goſpell ſtandeth in theſe three things. 1. The Lawe offereth ſaluation vnder condition of perfect obedience, that is to ſay, if wee doe it: the Goſpell vnder condicion of faith, that is to ſay, if we beleeue, Rom. 10. 5, 6. 2. The Law commandeth only, but giueth no power to performe it, and therfore is called the dead letter, written with inke and in tables of ſtone to be read and ſeene, but hauing no life in it to change the heart, which remaineth as ſtonie as before. The Goſpell not onely commandeth, but giueth faith and newneſſe of life: And is therefore ſaid to be written in our heartes and called the Spirit, becauſe it giueth the Spirit of Chriſt &amp; righteouſnes through him, 2. Cor. 3. 3, 6, 9. 3. The Lawe pronounceth nothing but iudgment and condemnation againſt vs, commaunding things altogither impoſſible through our corruption, and therefore terrefieth and amazeth the conſcience, in which reſpect it is called the miniſterie of death and of condemnation, 2. Cor. 3, 7, 9. The Goſpell bringeth glad tydinges of peace and reconciliation, and therfore quieteth and appeaſeth the conſcience, Rom. 5. 1. for both parts of this latter difference, ſee Rom. 10. 5, 6, 7, 8.

comelines of the Churche:

order is to be conſidered in
two principall things concerning
publick functions, that
is, aHeb. 5. 4. 5 calling and diſplacing.
               Calling is the appointing of
aEzee. 44. 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16 fit perſon to ſome function.
And ſtādeth vpon two partes,
Election and Ordination.
               Election is theNum 8. 16. 19 Actes. 14. 23. choſing of
him to the charge.
               Ordination is theNumb. 8. 10, 14 Actes 13. 2, 3 ſeparating

laying on of handes. Diſplacing
is theEzra. 2. 62 1 Tim. 3. 10 putting out of an
vnfit perſon.
               So much touching order:
Cenſure is a correction of

               Expulſion is a throwing of
heinous offenders out of the
Church. And is excommunication
or a Curſe.

            A ſhort explication of
the Lords Prayer, which (together
with the tenne Commaundmentes)
conteyneth a brief of all
the mayne heades of the whole
ſubſtance of Diuinitie, in a
moſt exact methode, as the
table following will
ſhewe.
            THE LORDES
Prayer, deliuered
by our Sauiour
Chriſt as a paterne
to frame all our
Prayers by, conteyneth a moſt abſolute
and perfect direction, aſwell
for the circumſtances to be obſerued
in praying, as for the matter it
ſelf of our prayer.
            The circumſtances are theſe:
1 To God only through Chriſt.
For neitherMath. 23. 
                     •
                  0 haue wee any other
Father in Heauen but him alone,

neither is hee our Father but in
Chriſt.
            2 Praeparation: taught by vſing
of a praeface.
            3 Faith, particularly applying
to our ſelues the loue of GOD in
Chriſt. Our Father.
            
            4 Confidence, as a childe goeth
bouldly to his Father.
            
            5 Reuerence of his Maieſtie,
Who is in Heauen.
            
            6 Zeale &amp; earneſtnes in prayer;
that all our affections be taken vp,
and wholy bent vpon it. Which
the ſhortneſſe of the prayer teacheth,
and the concluding of it
with this worde, Amen.
            
            7. A greater feruency of Spirite

in praying for the things that concerne
Gods glory, then for thoſe
that concerne our own good, yea
though it bee the ſaluation of our
ſoules. As appeareth by the order
of the petitions, and in that thoſe
firſt three are without any coupling
bonde at all, which the latter
three haue. Againe of the things
which concerne our owne good,
greater zeale and feruency to bee
ſhewed for heauēly things which
the three latter Petitions doe aſke
by name, then for earthly thinges
that are ſought but as additaments
and appendancies to the other.
            8 A fellow-feeling and loue one
vnto an other, Our Father, our bread,
our treſpaſſes, lead vs not deliuer vs, &amp;c.
            
            9 An aſſurance of obteyning
the thinges wee pray for. Earthlie
thinges with condition, ſo farre as

God hath appointed them for our
good. All other abſolutely without
condition. Which aſſurance
is noted in the word, Amen ſignifying
that not only ſo we deſire it
may be, but that ſo vndoubtedly it
is and ſhalbe. Wherevnto we are
induced, both by conſideration of
the loue of God, our Father, &amp; of
his power, which is in Heauen.
            
            Laſtly, continuance in prayer,
giue vs this day, Euery day renewing
our ſupplications.
            So much of the circumſtances.
The matter is partly in petition, &amp;
partly in thankeſgiuing, The petitions
are ſix in number. All in that
courſe and order as the doctrine
before was handled. Whereof the
firſt three are of thoſe thinges that
belong to Gods glorie without
any reſpect of our owne good, As
the particle, thy, in euery one doth

ſhew. And this one thing, wherin
the ſoundeſt Diuines agree, being
well obſerued, bringeth a great
light for the diſtinguiſhing of all
the ſix Petitions according to their
proper boundes and limits, in ſuch
ſort as hereafter followeth.
            The firſt Petition,I. PETITI. GOD. his Eſſence. Perſons. Perfection. 
               Hallowed be thy
Name. O thou the bleſſed &amp; great
Iehoua, Father, Sonne, and holy
Spirit, three perſons and one only:
true and euerliuing God, whoſe
Eſay. 9. 
                     •
                  . Name is Wonderfull, and who
alone art glorious and excellent;
thy mercy great vnto the heauens:
thy trueth vnto the cloudes: thy
righteouſnes as the mighty hilles:
thy iudgements like the bottomles
deepe: exalt thy ſelf. ô God, aboue
the heauens, thy glory ouer all the
earth. And make it knowen vnto
thy Creatures, that thou the Creatour
(bleſſed for euer, Amen) art a
nature ſpirituall and diuine, of thy

ſelfe, and in thy ſelfe, and by thy
ſelfe ſubſiſting. Eternall, immeaſurable,
incomprehenſible, infinite
in Power, Wiſedome, Holines,
Trueth,The cauſes of his owne perfection, and of all good and perfect things 
                     •
                  n other. Mercy, Iuſtice, and whatſoeuer
good is: yea goodnes and
perfection it ſelf. So that boeth
whatſoeur thou doeſt, is abſolutelie
good and holy, and all good &amp;
perfect guiftes are thine, there being
no iote nor reſemblance of
good in any creature but that onlie
which they haue frō thee, who
art the Father of lights.
            And this reſpecteth the firſt part
of Theologie, which is of the nature,
perſons, and properties of
the Godhead.
            The ſecond Petition,2. PETIT. The KINGDOME of God in his
                
               Thy Kingdome
come. Aduance the throne &amp;
ſcepter of thy kingdom in the gouernment
of the world according
to all thy counſels and purpoſes
decreed from eternitie.Eternal Decrees. Whether

of ſauing the elect or deſtroying of
the reprobate,Election. or of the buſines &amp;
affayres perteining to this life,Reprobation. Creation. Gouernement. and
thy generall prouidence ouer all
thinges; that thy handes haue faſhioned
and made. Together with
the meanes which thou haſt ſanctified
therevnto.The abſolute will of God, diſpoſing the meanes according to his owne good pleaſure. That the reprobate
may either not heare at all, or
hearing not beleeue, nor bee conuerted,
but hardened in their ſins;
and thy Goſpell with the Miniſterie
and Preaching thereof, the
Sacraments, Cenſures &amp; diſcipline
of the Church, and all other good
thinges thou haſt ordeined, may
(through their owne fault) turne
vnto their ruine, &amp; be a ſauour of
death vnto death vnto them, as cō
               trariewiſe
to the elect a ſauour of
life vnto life.The generalitie of his decrees &amp; works, ſtretching vnto all creatures and actions. And that thou wouldeſt
ſo diſpoſe of thinges by thy
hidden &amp; ſecret prouidence, that
all perſons and creatures (although

they, many of them, ſinnefully and
wretchedlie, moued with other
cauſes &amp; endes then in obedience
vnto thee, yet in regard of thy
worke moſt holily and iuſtly) may
concurre to doe whatſoeuer thy
hand and thy counſell hath foredetermined
to be done: Neither
let any power or pollicy of Sathan
or man,The inniolable Neceſſitie of the execution of his conſells. or any other creature, hinder
the executiō of thy moſt glorious
&amp; magnificent, moſt wiſe and
iuſt decrees. But let them all be as
the mountaines of braſſe, that cannot
bee remooued but ſtand faſt
for euer.
            And this reſpecteth the ſecond
braunch of Theologie, touching
the kingdome of God, and the diſpenſation
of his counſells.
            The third petition,3. PETIT. The HONOVR due to God. Performed by Angells. Sainctes in Heauen. The Church vpon earth. 
               Thy will bee
done in earth as it is in heauen. Haue
thou alwayes in the worlde, euen
here among men, as thou haſt among

thy holy Angells and Spirits
of the righteous that are deceaſed:
a Church &amp; choſen company,
which mayZach. 6. 8. refreſh and delight
thy Spirit, by yeelding with
free and ready hartes, all chearfull
obedience to thy knowen and revealed
will. Whileſt they be ſeen
to preferre the loue they beare to
thee, before the loue of thēſelues,
their own pleaſure, profit, or liues,
or whatſoeuer els that is moſt dear
vnto them.
            And this (which is the thirde
braunch of Theologie) riſeth by
a neceſſarie conſequence from the
former two. For he that is in himſelf
and in his workes ſo glorious,
is worthy and alone worthie to be
honored and ſerued of vs.
            The three latter Petitions are of
thoſe thinges that concerne our
owne and our neighbours good,
whereof the firſt (being the fourth

nature and eſſence. Conceyued
and born of a virgin by the wonderfull
worke of thy holy Spirite:Sanctification of his humane nature.
Sanctified from the wombe, to be
the mightie and powerfull inſtrument
in and by whoſe fleſh or humane
nature, the Godhead, vnto
the which he is perſonally vnited,
quickeneth all thoſe that by faith
are ingraffed in him; Repleniſhed
with all righteouſnes and fulnes of
the Spirite aboue meaſure:Righteouſnes. And
therefore in him ſelfe moſt happie
&amp; bleſſed,Bleſſednes. but for vs and our ſakes
accurſed,Suffrings. in that he bare thy whole
wrath due to our finnes, and became
ſubiect to death, the moſt

                  of God, fall afterwards to his adioyntes of kingdome and honour: ſo theſe beginne with Chriſt and regeneration through him, the fruites whereof are Iuſtification and Sanctification which followe in their place. As the Apoſtle, agreeably herevnto reduceth all the benefits we haue by Chriſt to thoſe three heades, and that in the ſame order. 1 Iohn 5. 8. There be three which heare record in earth. The Spirite, wherein we are regenerate: water, wherby we are waſhed and cleaned from our ſinne; And Blood, purging and aboliſhing both the roote and the fruites of it. Which is attributed to the blood of Chriſt, Heb. 9. 14. 1 Iohn. 1. 7, 9. And that it is ſo to bee taken in this place, not for expiation, I gather by that the Apoſtle ſaith verſ. 6 This is hee that came by water and blood, not by water only, but water and blood. That is to ſay, not our Iuſtifier onely which all men doe willinglie embrace: but to ſanctifie vs alſo, which men will not ſo eaſily bee brought to yeeld vnto.
                  4. Seeing it is plaine that in aſking pardon of our ſinnes and righteouſnes in Chriſt (which we do in the fifth petition) Conſequently we aſke all the belſſednes belonging to it. One part whereof is this, to haue all outward things as additaments and appendancies caſt vnto vs, ſo farre as God hath appointed thē for our good, as our Sauiour Chriſtes both ſpeech and promiſe is, Mat. 6. 33. and further then that we haue no warrant to deſire them; it ſeemeth not ſo likely that either our Sauiour Chriſt would rent theſe thinges aſunder and tranſplant one from another, or in ſo ſhort a ſumme admit of repetition, which muſt needes follow if being there included we aſke them here by name. And this alſo may ſerue to proue that no defect or may me cā iuſtly be imputed to this abſolute forme of prayer, though outward things come not within compaſſe of the fourth petition.
                  5. The doubling of the article 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      ſheweth it to be meant of no cōmon bread, but a bread of ſome rare and ſinguler qualitie. The like doubling of the article for emphaſis ſake you may ſee Math. 3. 17. Luke. 15. 22, 23. and in diuerſe other places. Laſtly the worde 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      which maketh all the doubt, being neuer read but in this prayer onely, and therefore of an vncerteyne ſignification, I deriue form 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      with the beſt Interpreters, as I make no doubt it muſt of neceſſitie be: But not in that ſence which I ſee them to doe. Who expound it competent or ſufficient for our nature, that is for our ſuſtenance and nouriſhment. Of which ſignification of the worde 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      you ſhall hardly finde nay example, as H. Stephen in his greeke Theſaurus noteth. But in that ſence which the Scripture vſeth it Luc. 15. 12, 13. (and neuer otherwiſe) as it ſignifieth wealth and ſubſtance, from whence I take to bee deriued two wordes of neere affinitie 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      here, and 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      Tit. 2. 14. One noting that which as the remayn and ouerplus of our ſubſtance we lay vp in ſtore and keepe for a Iewell, the other that which excelleth all wealth and subſtance. Which (among many other) is one ſignification of the praepoſition 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      Rom. 9. 5. Ephe. 4. 6. And ſo doth 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      aptly aunſwer to the Haebrue Hal col hon Pſalm. 119. 14. I reioyce in the way of thy teſtimonies, as aboue all ſubſtance. And it ſeemeth vnto mee that our Sauiour Chriſt doth herein allude to that ſaying of Salomon Cantie. 8. 11. If a man would giue all the ſubſtance of his houſe for this loue (of Ieſus Chriſt, to whom I am euen now aſcending out of the wildernes of this world to ioyne and vnite my ſelfe by faith) he ſhould utterly be deſpiſed. Yet the other interpretation which the moſt learned &amp; beſt diuines of our time do follow, carrieth a ſound &amp; a Godly ſence, againſt which no exception can be taken. And therefore in ſuch caſes men are not to ſtriue.
               
               
ignominious death of the croſſe it
ſelfe. Vnder which notwithſtanding
he did not lye, for that it was
impoſſible for him to bee holden
of it. But loſing the panges &amp; ſorrowes
of death,Reſurrection. he roſe againe and
aſcended into heauen. Where he
ſitteth at the right hande of thy
moſt excellent Maieſtie to make
continuall interceſſion for thoſe
that are his; and hath obteyned a
Name aboue all names, a crowne
of glory and a kingdome whereof
there ſhall not be any end. Gouerning
all things in Heauen &amp; vpon
the earth: vanquiſhing and ſubduing
the prowde enemies, and rebells

bells to his kingdome, and leading
captiuitie captiue:Calling. Gathering out
of the wicked world a holy nation:
a peculier people (in reſpect
of their outwarde calling) to the
prayſe of his glorious name:Knowledge. Opening
their eyes to beholde the vnſearcheable
riches of himſelfe, in
whom are hidden all the treaſures
of wiſedome and vnderſtanding:
filling their hearts with the manifolde
graces and bleſſings of his
Spirit:Faculties. Seperating &amp; choſing out
from among them,Miniſteries. Paſtors, Teachers,
and other Officers, for the
well ordering and guyding of his
houſe, which is the Church of the

liuing God.Light of the Spirite. And not onely reaching
forth to many of them from
aboue, a comfortable taſte of the
ſweetnes and excellencie that is in
him: but vpon ſuch and ſo many
as God the Father (through him)
hath from euerlaſting purpoſed
vnto glorie, powring downe that
moſt excellent and precious gifte
of faith, proper to the elect,Faith. whereby
he giueth himſelf to bee theirs,
and taketh them to be his, knitteth
and vniteth them as members to
that miſticall body whereof himſelf
is the head, maketh them in a
ſpirituall and vnſpeakable ſorte,
bone of his bones, fleſh of his fleſh,

and one togither with him. And
ſo becometh vnto them that heauenlie
and ſupernaturall breade,
wherby their ſoules are fed vnto
euerlaſting life.
            Good Lord,Math. 6. 11. 
               this day, and
               Luc. 11. 3.

day giue this our bread vnto vs.
That wee may ſo come vnto him,Infancie of a regenerate eſtate.
as wee may neuer hunger: ſo beleeue
in him, as wee may neuer
thirſt: ſo be regenerate and borne
againe, by the incorruptible ſeede
of the worde of God which liueth
and abideth for euer,Preaching. that it may
neuer dye within vs:Perſeuerance. but confirmed
ſtill in our moſt holy faith, by
the preaching of thy Goſpel, participatiō
               
of thy Sacraments, Prayer,
and other holy meanes, wee may
grow vp throughlie in him which
is our head,Grouth. till we come to the full
age of men-growen in Chriſt.Mans eſtate.
            
            The fifth Petition: And forgiue
vs our treſpaſſes, as wee forgiue them
that treſpaſſe againſt vs,
               5. PETIT is for the firſt
kinde of righteouſnes which wee
haue from Chriſt.Iuſtification, That is to ſay,
imputed righteouſnes, forgiuenes
of ſinnes, which is but one parte
being put for the whole.
            Pardon and forgiue vs all our
ſinnes through the death and ſufferinges
of thy Sonne,Forgiuenes of ſinnes, both the guylt and puniſhment. and ſo remoue
both the guylt and puniſhment
away from vs. Clothe vs
with his all ſufficient and moſt abſolute
and perfect righteouſnes,Imputation of righteouſnes.
that ſo being iuſtified by his obedience,
we may haue our part of
all that bleſſednes,Bleſſednes. which is able to

fall into this life: where the teſtimonie
and aſſurance of thy loue,Reconciliation to God.
and the hauing and enioying (in
and from thy loue) of all the good
things of this preſent life,All outwarde good things, pleadges of Gods loue. both for
neceſſitie and Chriſtian delight,
maintenāce, health, credit, friends,
comfort of Wife, Children, Seruauntes:

of all things,Yea our very troubles. euen our verie
troubles and croſſes of this life

mercie haſt appointed for vs:Peace of conſcience.
Peace of conſcience, and ioye in
the holy Ghoſt, doe excell:Ioy in the H. Ghoſt, &amp;c. and by
theſe degrees, as it were by ſo manie
ſteppes and ſtaires, make vs to

for thy Saintes in heauen.Saluation.
            
            
               
The laſt petition, And lead vs not
into tentation, but deliuer vs from euill,

is for the other kinde of righteouſnes
which we haue frō Chriſt,Sanctification. that
is to ſay, renewed righteouſnes.
            Being now engraffed into the noble
ſtock of the body of thy ſonne,
and iuſtified through him: ſanctifie
vs alſo by his Spirit dwelling in vs:Mortification.
mortifying &amp; ſubduing ſinne that
it beare not the ſway in our mortall
bodies, that neither the Deuill, the
World, nor the fleſh, or our owne
corruption prevayle againſt vs, to
make vs to fulfill the luſtes thereof:
but goe forward with the worke of
our new birth,Quickening quickning and renewing
vs in our memorie, iudgement,
will, affections, and in all the
partes and powers of our ſoule and
bodie, from dead workes to ſerue
thee the true and the liuing God-Hale
and pull vs (as a beaſt that ſticketh
