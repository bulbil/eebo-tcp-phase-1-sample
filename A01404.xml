            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, THE Earle of Clenricard, Gouernor of Conach, and Councellor of State in his Maiesties Kingdome of Ireland.
            
            
               RIGHT HONORABLE:
            
            
               I Haue my selfe beene an eye-witnesse of your Loyaltie, and generall loue to our Country, or if you please, the Maiesty of England, and can resolue the strangest humor'st; that neuer man deserued better of the State, then your selfe for many employments: But especially, when I saw you Knighted in the Field (and none but your selfe) yea the durty fields before Kinsole, my heart leaped for ioy to apprehend, that your Vertue

and worth commanded that addition of Honour, without which, let ambitious hastinesse imagine what it list, Princes cannot set their best Fauorites on a more substantiall Seate of glorious eminence: And thus much for the generall. For particulars, I was in those dayes beholding to your Table and Purse, and in a manner the third Officer of your Regiment; as it pleased you to grace and fauour me farre beyond my desert. All which considered, as I haue great reason to bee thankefull vnto you, so could I thinke of no better meanes, then this poore Dedication: First, because I am resolued it will out-last a Marble Toombe, and when Death hath vndertaken to obliterate our memories, yet shall after-ages demand, who this Earle of Clenricard was, and wish from their hearts, that the Noble men of their times would set you before them for a Mirror: Secondly, because it is the remarkeablest Story of Ireland, and a businesse so well knowne to your selfe, that I submit to your better iudgement, if I haue fayled in any thing: Thirdly, because I am taught by experience, that there is no presenting of Bookes to any man, without a primordiall acquaintance, secret supportation, or (as wee call it) Court friendshippe. Last of all, and I hope the best of all, because it may stand

in the steade of Precept, or Caution to detaine such worthy persons within their owne Circles, or diuert them from presuming on any power against such a Prince, as the Monarch of Great Britaine, of gouernement, as the Maiesty of England: In which assurance, I leaue you to the Commander of all Thoughts, Words, and Actions, submitting my selfe and the worke, to your fauourable censure, and Honourable acceptation.
            
               
                  Your Honours humbly deuoted, Th. Gainsforde.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            
            THE EXEMPLARY HISTORY AND Lamentable deiection of the Heart of Tyrone.
            
               THEY, which write of the Basilisck, and would seeme to dispell the vapours of ignorance, with the strong and swift winde of knowledge: report, that whosoeuer hee lookes vpon, dies the death, but if he be first discouered, his owne venome poysons himselfe: whereupon Treasons are resembled to his eyes, which of their owne nature must needes preuaile without preuention, but made apparant by some timely intelligence, they are broken as wee say, in the shell; and strangled in the Wombe: Notwithstanding, such hath been the secrets of Innouation, and disposition of turbulent spirits, that they euer had a trick to flie to forraigne Princes for refuge, when their owne designes were vnable to stand vpright in the frame of gouernement. And although I neuer read of subiect, that returned to recouer his estate, or purposes, by the meere coadiutement of a forraigne King (except that King proiected for himselfe, to make anothers disloyaltie the steps to stand more firmely vpon, and raise his owne ambition to a greater height) yet haue they not desisted to follow the deceits of their owne hearts, and

as the Iewes found a rotten Reede and broken Staffe of Egypt, vndertaken impossibilities, to the destruction of infinite thousands, and at the best but the sauing of their owne liues for a time.
            For although Hadad an Edomite of the Kings seede fled vnto Pharao King of Aegypt, who gaue him a House, Land, and the sister of his wife, euen Taphnes the Queene, whereby it should seeme hee thriued in his reuolt: Yet alas was it so farre from preiudicing of Salomon, that he onely discouered a willingnesse, without power or meanes to disturbe the State, and made the great King stand on his guard the better: Although Ieroboam fled vnto Sisag, continuing there vnto the death of Salomon, and so receiued as it were supportation in his Treasons: Yet it was the reuolt of the tenne Tribes, and the curse which branded Salomons Idolatry, made Israel rebell against Rehoboam, and settled this Seruant in his Masters Throne: Although as Herodotus reporteth, that Harpagus Medus (after Astiages had with great immanity murthered his Sonne) fled vnto Cirus into Persia, in hope of reuenge, and so set the East and whole Asia in combustion: Yet alas hee onely made hauock of his Countrey, and brought a stranger to possesse both the Monarchies.
            
            If you ouerlooke the story of Hannibal, and would know, what entertainement hee had with Prusias King of Bithinia, you shall finde him a miserable spectacle of deiection, and that hee onely opened him the doores of death, scarce affording him leisure to enter, before hee was deliuered into the hands of scorne, according to their intention to leade him captiue to Rome. Looke vpon Pompeis miseries, who fled vnto Ptolomy his supposed friend: but to what end? Euen to be brought to the house of slaughter, for feare of the preuailer: What could Cleopatra auaile her Anthony, or Lepidus, Sestus Pompeius, and infinite others, sufficiently shrowd themselues vnder forraigne shades, when the greater cloudes were thickned to raine downe shewres of deuastation, vpon their heads? and Octauius held vp his head in the turbulent Sea of those ciuill warres. And thus could I send you into the wilde fields

of instances (especially concerning traytors, who were all choaked with this Machiuillian Position of admitting the Treason, but not suborning the Traytors) did I not purpose to disclaime an vnciuill vncouering the hoary head of Antiquity, and diuulge this Principle, that there is no confidence in Princes, further then the reuolts of others may second their own businesse, and the priuate quarrels of a kingdome weaken themselues for a strangers admission, which yet must be done by the factions, and coadiutements of the same Nation: Therfore I stand amazed at the fanaticall hopes of diuers Spirits in our nation, that in those daies relied vpon the supportation of Spayne, &amp; are still confident on the blessings and cursings of the Pope, especially his ridiculous excommunicating of Princes, now laughed at through the World; when they cannot afford me one example, neither domestick, nor forraigne; neither obsolete or moderne; neither diuine nor prophane, of any subiect stepping awry into the by-waies of rebellion or insurrection, that was established by a forraigne Prince, except that Prince (as I said before) proiected by such a bridge to transport his owne power for his owne ends, and priuate satisfaction; But I would faine disclaime any vnciuill opening the graues of the Dead; and content my selfe with displaying the colours of time, not yet elapsed from our owne memories.
            When the children of that worthy Edmond Ironside fled into Hungarie from that preuailing greatnesse of Canutus, I doe not read of their triumphant returne, nor other establishment against that braue Dane, till the factions of England broke out into flames of their priuate reuenges. When Henry the second had crowned his sonne King of England, and that the impatient young man could not endure his owne Father in the competition, the Story saies, the Prince with his brethren fled into France, but how they returned; how they prospered; &amp; how they were supported, it is lamentable one way to report, and remarkeable another way to relate. In that deplorable businesse of Edward the second, when his wife and son presumed on the assistance of the French King; I hope it was

not that power which established the young Prince, but the authoritie of Mortimer that suppressed the misled King: When Henry the fourth preuailed, Queene Isabel fled to her owne brother, about the restoring of Richard 2. but to what purpose? To bemoane her remedilesse griefes, and returne, (if euer shee did returne) without suppliment of sufficient assistance: The Earle of Richmond, though afterward Henry the seuenth, in the confused times of the Yorkest preuailings, went into Brittaine, and so into France, but how he had like to haue beene serued, Peter Landoise the Secretary, and the Kings gold could then haue vnueiled the corruption of either, and when that Fortune led him by the hand, to pace out the measures of victories, I hope it was no French power, but English Friends and the Iustice of Diuine prouidence, which seated him so happily in the Throne of greatnesse: How Perkin Warbeck, for all his exhaled vapouring, went forward assisted by the Scottish policie, Flemmish credulitie, and inueterat malice of the Duches of Burgundy, against the house of Lancaster, our stages of London, haue instructed those which cannot read: How the Earle of Westmerland, and numbers of English fugitiues, haue beene entertained abroad, some ouerthrown with calamitous desperation, some colluded with the incantations of Friers &amp; religious miracles, some distracted with guiltines of Conscience, some transfounded with ambitious prosecutions, &amp; some preuaricated with an outward glory of Military profession, all men can discouer with repining eyes, or else let them ouerlooke a well compacted breuiary to the same purpose, discoursing of the entertainement of English fugitiues beyond the Seas.
            In the heate of our Enmity with Spaine, Don Antonio King of Portingall flies vnder the couert of a Princely protection, which to the admiration of the World so expanded it selfe, that we brought him to the gates of Lisbone, but were deceiued with his presumptuous weakenesse, and ouer-credulous information: Somewhat neere the same account, another personating the King Sebastian, supposedly slaine in the fields of Barbary, astonished Florence and Venice, with many preuailing

probabilities of his life, but the King of Spaine was in the strength of a new possession, and the Italians too fearefull to rayse vp a Spirit they knew not how to coniure downe againe: If you would commiserate the misfortunes of Stukely, I could Catalogue all his proceedings, and relate, that the best glory of his entertainement, both with the King of Spaine and the Pope, consisted in some poore mercenary allowances, and when it was at the highest, to flourish onely with the titular dignity of the Marquesse of Dubline: but alas it wanted the essentiall parts and proppes of such a businesse, Men▪ and Treasure, so that I may very well conclude against all such exhalations, and infatuated men, with the significant Poet,
               
                  Non ideo debet pelago se credere, si qua
                  audet in exiguo ludere cimbalacu.
               
            
            What say you to Antonio de Peres? for whom the warres of Aragon burst forth into the reproach of seditious reuolts, and tumultuary disobedience? was hee not a while suffulciated amongst vs! vntill those vnlookt for conditions of peace, hung downe the heads of many military and noble minded English, sending him to put his confidence in God, for the Princes of the World had failed him: You haue heard how the Duchy of Millane was as it were dilacerated with troubles, and posted ouer from perplexity to perplexity, vntill the Emperour Charles the fift made it a meritorious act, to secure it vnder the strength of his protection: but alas! hee quickly left them staggering in their weakenesse, and widened his owne embraces to hug them warme for himselfe, and keep them close to the Maiesty of Spaine. What say you to the Duke de Maine, and many of that French League; how did they excruciat themselues, to be shouldered aside from their expectation of forraigne coadiutement? and when they had laboured to hide themselues in the Reedes of the Arch-Dukes Pooles, yet were they faine to make themselues cleane againe, by a contrary submission in the springs of their owne Countrey, assuring the malecontents of their combination, that no Prince will hazard the peace of his Countrey,

and Treasure of his Common-wealth, for any forraigne Subiect liuing, vnles as in many places before, the proiect is contriued for their owne glory or benefite.
            I could beginne againe, with the vnnaturall distractions of the Warres betweene Lancaster and Yorke, when Queene Margaret the Virago of her time, and her faction fled both into Scotland and France, but with what comforts of supportation there, and reliefe at home, the Catastrophes of her husband and sonne can delineate her misfortunes, and her owne dismission out of England bee a sufficient warning to all disastrous Princes, especially seditious Subiects, neither to trust their owne strength, &amp; friends in vniustifiable proceedings, lest with Phaetons wilfulnesse, they finde the Sunnes horses too too headstrong for their managing, nor be too confident in the best aduersity on the presidiary helpes of a Stranger, if once the businesse tend to draw an Army into the field, and as it were to pull off the Gates of anothers Maiesty ouer the hindges: But of all other, the history of Tirone and Terconell, is most lamentable, and remarkeable, who while I was in Italy passed by Millane to Rome, but in such a manner, as if Zedechias eyes were put out, and the Princes of Iuda carried captiue to Babylon before the Monarch of the East: for his entertainement with Spaine was no better then in a common Inne at Milbane, with a common tricke to grace and flatter him with a foolish title of the Prince of Ireland, and at Rome hee was the subiects of Charity, and had onely a poore suppliment from some speciall Cardinals: yet because I haue beene a spectator of this flourishing Tree, like the Chaldeans vision, and saw his blasting and fall of Leaues, as the Fig-tree cursed by our Sauiour, giue mee leaue▪ to bee beholding to Mr 
               Cambdens compendious discourse, and with some additions of my owne, set him thus on the Stage of fearefull admiration.
            Thus much by way of Introduction. The Story followes.
         
         
            
            THE HISTORIE OF THE EARLE of Tirone.
            
               I Will here desist from any dilations of Irish businesse of old, or mention of the great Oneale, who, as they say, before the comming of Saint Patrick possessed Vlster, and most parts of Ireland, shining as the Sunne of the same, vntill the conquest from England obscured his light, and taught his barbarous immanity another manner of obedience, and lesson of submission to a greater Maiesty, by which occasion this ambitious family was in a manner suppressed, and lost that seeming lustre, where with it graced the North of Ireland, yea the whole Iland, lying close to the shore, and not daring once to launch forth into the Ocean of turbulent dissention, or refractary contesting with England, vntill Edward de Bruse of Scotland proclaymed himselfe King of Ireland. Then Douenaldus Oneale impatient of such indignity, launched forth by degrees into the Channell of a new disturbance, and held vp his head, as presuming on his owne Greatnesse equall to Bruses, and so in his letters and submission to the Pope, accustomed the titles of heire of Ireland, King of Vlster, and one of the sonnes of the mother Church: But that trouble appeased, these new Kings were separated, and their vnited Greatnesse euen in their posterity disioynted, vntill againe, that

implacable contention betweene the two Families of Yorke and Lancaster, not onely deformed the prosperity of England, but according to the preuailing of factious Greatnesse, sent ouer diuers Gouernours, their particeans into Ireland, who still temporizing with the strongest party, and contriuing for their priuate, lest the generall cause at randome, and were indeed vnable to redact to any vniformity of gouernement the disparity of Irish obedience, and so gaue way vnto this ambitious, insulting, and rude people to hold vp their heads, and aduance themselues, as high as their owne titles, the law Tanist, and liberty of nature could dignifie them.
            Wherevpon Harry Oneale the son of Oenus or Eugenius, matched himselfe with the daughter of Th. Earle of Kildare, &amp; his son Con More, or great Con, married the daughter of Gerald Earle of Kildare, his owne mothers Neece, whereby vnited to the flourishing colours of the Geraldines, which many yeeres had beene displayed in Ireland, and swelled with the fulnesse of a most vberant family, they beganne (besides a strange elation of their spirits) with a tyrannous suppression of their own Nation, and this Con More despised all titles of either Prince▪ Duke, Marquesse or Earle in respect of the name of Oneale: To this Con succeeded another Con, surnamed Banco, or Lance, whose inueterate hate against the English was such, that hee cursed his posterity if either they learned the language, sowed any wheate, or builded houses: This mans greatnesse bred him enuy in the Court of England, &amp; according to the misery of all times, there wanted not priuate whisperers, yea flatterers of Princes, by whose suggestion that famous King Henry the eight was iealous of his power, especially when it was corroborated by that factious house of Kildare, whose story alone is of worthy memory, and affordeth so many excellent obseruations, that I wish them folded vp, as it were in one carpet, to be spred abroad with hansomnesse for our delight and vnderstanding.
            But when the strength of our armies, and fortune of the warres had both ouerawed their weaknesse, and reduced to

good order those dangerous enemies, bringing them into the schoole of correction for their misdemeanors, and reformation for their inciuility: This Con was compelled to prostrate himselfe before the Maiesty of England, and so disclaimnig the title of Oneale, by Letters-Patents was created Earle of Tirone, his eldest sonne Mathew (though suspected a Bastard) Baron of Dunganon, and all his Family, as it were incorporated to the new obedience of the King: This Mathew vntill the age of fifteene yeere, was imputed the sonne of a Smith in Dundalk, whose wife being Oneales Concubine, did at the time of death, according to the custome of Ireland, present him with this sonne, whome Oneale did not onely receiue with gladnesse, but accepted him as his owne, yea preferred him before his other children to his titles, and possessions.
            But Iohannes or Shane Oneale, his sonne by a lawfull wife, tooke it in such indignity, that making a strong faction against his father, hee not onely supplanted his brother Mathew, cutting off his head, but tormented the old Con with many vnnaturall assaults, and violent excursions, depopulating his territories, killing his complices, banishing his auxiliaries, and at last brought him with vntimely griefe vnto his graue, and all the country to bee affrighted with his tyranny. For he not onely stepped forward more gloriously, then his other ancestors, proclayming himselfe the great Oneale, but with seuerall expeditions contracted the loue and obseruation of the other Prouinces, insomuch that many Rebels both of Conach, Meths, and Munster assisted him in the prosecution of Mathews childrē, amongst whom Brian (falling into the hands of Maudonel Totan) was cruelly murthered: Hugh &amp; Cormach were vnder English protection, and hardy preserued, which fell out so crosly against Shanes expectation, and disastrous to his rebellious presumption, that with a lothsome sauagenesse, and traitrous conspiracy he deformed the beauty of Irelands peace, and made hauock in a strange manner of her prosperity, to which insolency and violent rage of preuailing, Sir Henry Sidney, L. Iustice of Ireland, in the absence of T. Earle

of Sussex Lord Lieutenant made opposition, and cast such blocks in the way, that his fury was somewhat rebated, and a Cataplasme of restraint applied; and when there was no remedy but cutting and fearing the vlcerous flesh of this putrified body of Rebellion, by force of Armes, hee not onely propulsed the indignity, lashing the sides of these proud Treasons with the stripes of a reuengefull hand, but brought this insulting Lord on his knees, and made him confesse the superiority of Englands Maiesty.
            But first by way of expostulation, the matter was disputed with this Shane, how he durst presume to cast, as it were a defiance into the face of Englands Gouernment, and put on his Iearean wings to flie higher, then his owne Feathers would warrant him. Hee answered very peremptorily, that hee was the true, and lawfull heire of Con Oneale, as issuing from a worthy wife and of a noble house, whereas Mathew was the Sonne of a Smith in Dondalck, and onely foisted in to ouerthrow the families of Oneale, which hee neither would nor could be a Pathick vnto, as for the Kings Letters patents affording Con the honor of a Coronet, and title of Earle, a cunning way to extenuate his worth, and greatnesse in his countrey, it was apparant, that Con had no interest, but for tearme of life, nor could without the consent of the Lords, and Dinastas of Vlster, transferre anothers right into the Kings hands: Besides, such was the ancient glory of his Familie, that the true heire must bee certified by the Oath of Twelue Men, which in Mathews case fayled, and therefore was the nullity of them very conspicuous, and all such proceedings of England against him worthily frustrated, but concerning himselfe, he had approbation both from God &amp; Man, as the lawfull Sonne of a louing Wife, and was confirmed by the law Tanist, according to the suffrages of the people, and seuerall applauses of the Families of Vlster, and for his since progression, hee neuer admitted of other thought, then to maintaine the ancient glory of his vnmatchable House, nor vsurped other iurisdiction, then his Ancestors by many Presidents, &amp; apparant records had formerly exercised, and confirmed without

contradiction, and to which, the other Kings of England had graciously consented, and most indulgently protected them.
            Notwithstanding all this, hee ranne a contrary course to former protestations, &amp; in the violent race of rebellion, plunged himself, to his vtter extirpation &amp; confusion, as by the sequell may appeare: For first he audaciously suppressed O Realy, &amp; quarrelling with Callogh O Donel, defeated his complices, tauished his wife, imprisoned himselfe and children, deuasted his Castles, vsurped his inheritance, and like the King of Vlster indeede proceeded with all imperiousnesse, and malicious insulting ouer his inferiors: but as soone as Thomas Earle of Sussex, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, prepared our English forces to rebate his pride, and reduce the other Countries, hee a little moderated his ambitious courses, and a while procrastinated his former resolutions, wherein the perswasion of Gerard Earle of Kildare his Cosin, whom Queene Mary had restored, was so effectuall, that he retired into England, and in all suppliant manner abiected himselfe before the Councell, with promises and strange protestations, not onely of being a true subiect, but an entertayner of Ciuility, and fashionable order, both in life and habit: the hope whereof dismissed him home againe, and like a cunning strumpet, insinuating with the good opinion of a new deceiued Friend, hee beganne reasonably well, shutte his eares against the Syren-like temptations of his Bardes and Rimers, vndertooke to heare the controuersies of his people, releeued the wants of the distressed. In a word, demeaned himselfe with a noble kinde of moderation in Peace, and when there was cause of Warre, expulsed the Scots of Vlster, &amp; cut off the head of Iames Mac-Connell their captaine, and principall occasion of that Innouation.
            In these sweete passages of peace and quietnesse, hee continued a while, and the poore churle thought hee beheld a faire shining Planet in a perspicuous Heauen, growing proude of such an alteration, that hee now might complaine of receiued iniuries, and obtaine redresse for vnsufferable wrongs:

But the better sort finding him ouer-insolent to indure, and misdoubting a proiect against all their estates and dignities, complotted to ouerthrow him, suggesting matter against him, and so ordered the busines, that Mac-Guier Lord of Fermanagh came in person to Sir Henry Sidney, by this time Lord Deputy, to implore his assistance, for the restrayning, or if you will, suppressing this vsurping King of the North, which Shane Oneale tooke so despitefully, and apprehended with such indignation, that drunke with rage, he became vnsensible of reason, &amp; forgetting his allegeance with all the former faire promises of loyaltie, he prosecuted Mac-Guier at his returne, with fire and sword, besieged Armagh, demolished the Church, destroyed the buildings, and came to Dondalk, with purpose to ruine the Countrey, but was a while intercepted by a worthy expedition of Sir Wil. Sercefield Maior, and the Citizens of Dubline, I might adde the power of the Countrey, &amp; the mustred forces of the English Irish about Sordes &amp; Tredagh.
            
            By this time are the royall arms of the State spred abroad, &amp; the Lord Deputy, after he had shipped 7. companies of Foot, &amp; a troope of Horse for Logh-foile vnder the command of Sir Ed. Randoll, set forward in person toward the North with the rest of the Army, which when Shane had intelligence of (as what could be done, which some or other made him not acquainted with?) &amp; that hee vnderstood there was a purpose with all aduantages to presse him both behinde &amp; before, he raysed himselfe toward the Derry, and with great expedition brought the matter to deciding, so that many skirmishes were but as it were preparatiues to that maine encounter, which to his perpetual renown cost Sir Ed. Randoll his life, &amp; brought Shane to confusion: For very quickly all his purposes were disanulled, his forces weakened, his Rebels dissipated, &amp; the whole strength of his proiects infringed; so that despayring to reintegrate his estate, he determined a strange alteratiō (O that man dare presume of any thing, being subiect to such an alteration!) with a Halter about his neck, to submit to the Deputy: but diuerted from so base a course by the aduice, and couragious spirit of his Secretary, hee made tryall of a new

confederacy with Alexander Oge and the Scots, who were resident and rebellious in the Claude Boies.
            
            But first, as an introduction of peace, hee released Surleboy, the brother of Alexander, whom hee had long detained in prison: and thus presuming on this new combination with the enforced Odonnels wife, and some few others, he is welcommed into the tent of Alexander, and for the present entertained as the very Prince of the North, or King of Vlster: but after extraordinary drinking, and ouer-liberall carouses, certaine vnkindnesses and vnfortunate repetitions began betweene them about his other brothers death, and the honour of his sister, whom Shane had formerly married, but despightfully refused: Wine ouercame reason, reason thus entangled was subiected to confusion of words, words encreased rage; and rage induced reuenge; so that Alex▪ Oge, and Mac. Gilaspic his brother tooke aduantage of the time and these occasions, which was performed with such inueterate malice, and offensiue digressions, that Shane was set vpon, ouermastered, and with many wounds slaine: that his Secretary was cut in pieces, his wife or rather Concubine surprised, and the company dispersed: that the Rebels of the North were vtterly subuerted, these Scots made a way to their admission and pardon, and by consequence the peace of Vlster restored.
            This businesse thus setled and determined, a Parliament was called in Ireland, in which Shane Oneale with all his followers was proscribed, the name of Oneale interdicted, the Lands and territories of the North or Vlster incorporated to the Crowne of England, and all occasions of innouation remoued, had not Turlogh Leignogh brothers sonne to Con More Oneale assumed the title: a man of declining age, and more quiet then the rest of his name, suspecting indeede, that according to their law Tanist, either Shane Oneales sonnes, or Hugh Baron of Dunganmon might intercept his claime, and preuent his right, as he supposed, which compelled him to this audacious enterprise, contrary to the edict and prohibition of the same: notwithstanding, to salue the sore of his suspected loialty, he kept correspondency with vs in all his other actions,

and in her Maiesties seruice, not only encountred Odonell, but ouerthrew the Scots Ilanders, and at last destroyed Alexander Oge, the murtherer of Shane Oneale.
            
            All this while Hugh the sonne of Mathew stood on his guard, and liued warily: sometimes vnder the security of his owne faithfull followers, sometimes vnder the trust of English protection, (for so in his yonger time he trooped in the streets of London with sufficient equipage, and orderly respect) and sometimes as a Souldier he commanded a company of horse vnder the Deputy in Munster, against the Earle of Desmond, with a pension beside of one thousand marke a yeere out of the Exchequer, which orderly proceedings with the trust conceiued of his loialty drew the bow for him, wherewith hee hot the marke of his owne aime, and so by new Leters-Patents, hauing diuers restraints and reseruations, hee was admitted to his Grandfathers titles, and inheritances, nor should it seeme that Turlogh Leignogh stomached his aduancement, but rather vpon hope of his vertues, which gaue a lustre to his actions, surrendred his titles and Lordships into his hands: But oh the ambition of men? or vnconstancy of manners? these proceedings with him in this faire and gentle manner, made him either proud of his owne greatnesse, or presumptuous that the State was afraid to displease him, or superstitious after the Priests had insorcered him. For presently against the Queenes absolute prohibition, this new Tirone takes vpon him the title of Oneale, excusing the fact, lest some rebellious spirit according to their warlike custome of maintaining that Character in their Family, might assume the same, taking aduantage of his negligence, protesting to disclaime the honour, so he might not be vrged by oath: and from hence arose the first motiue of Tirones vnsted fastnesse.
            At this instant was that memorable defeat, and admirable discomfiture of the King of Spaines formidable Armado, or if you will according to Mendozas owne words (then Embasdor Leiger in Paris) inuincible Nauy, whereby in their returne by Scotland and Ireland, many of them perished, but the better sort were kindly intertaind by Tirone after the manner of

               Irish Hospitality, and vnexpectedly welcome, considering, that any reliefe to men in distresse, and cast on a strange shore by Shipwrack, is as Balme and Oile powred into wounds: In requitall whereof such a Loome of mischiefe was set on worke, that at the last the cloth was wouen of his corruption, and folded together to keepe his treasons warme in his owne bosome, till a strong supposed, and yet presumptuous hand, spred it abroade to his vtter destruction, and shamefull disgrace by reason of his deformed filthinesse.
            For when then these straggling Spaniards perceiued his naturall inclination to ambitious willingnesse, concerning the maintaining some turbulent faction in Ireland, and demonstration of a stirring spirit for the glory of his Ancestors, they quickly added fuell to the fire, and with all the baites of prosperity and incantations to flattery choaked his loialty, &amp; cast dust into the eyes of his faithfulnesse: Some promising, that their great Master should recompence his humanity, and noble respect: Some repining at their misfortune, layd many slaunders on the shoulders of our country: Some vnder collour of religious obedience assured, that the Pope himselfe should gratifie him: Some more dangerously cunning crept within him by that imposturing art of commendation, inferring he was more worthy of a Crowne, then a subiects prostitution, &amp; some more plainely with demonstratiue reasons led him as it were by the hand to the chaire of presumption, and possibility, that it might bee so, if he durst attend his owne fortunes, and prosecute the times in their seuerall changes: By which occasion this mans irresolute loue to his Prince and country was first enuenomed and tainted: Afterward it rancled more and more in his declining from himselfe and first soundnesse by contracting a league with Spaine. Thirdly, it swelled apace with the oath and allegeance of many followers, and particians, to coadiute him in any enterprise whatsoeuer; and last of all, it restred incurably in consenting (and putting the same in practice) to bee an opposite to the gouernment of England, and a famous Rebell against the peace of our country, which yet was neither so cautelously disposed of,

nor firmely compacted, but Hugh ne Gauclock, his brother, fearing the feareful consequence of the downefall of his house, discouered the same, for which the Earle found a time to strangle him, colourably prosecuting the Actors, that durst lay hands on any of the bloud of Oneale: but alas it serued not his turne: For not onely this barbarous Fratricide, but all his other refractary courses were laid open to the peering eyes of Englands Maiesty: but such was his preuailing fortune, that vpon his reasonable iustifications, and seeming penitency, our gracious Elizabeth not onely remitted those offences with fauour, but continued him in his Greatnesse with Honour.
            In this manner he moued awhile in the highest orbe of prosperity, and from our English supportation commanded his country, as a Prince of the North, and except an open displaying of the colours of Rebellion, performed, what he durst, and durst doe any thing, which tended not to manifest treason, and dangerous innouation. For not long after, vnder colour of corroborating the peace of his country and insinuation with some English affinity, hee made Sir Samuel Bagnols sister beleeue, that the great Oneale of Ireland was captiuated to her loue, and in which, if the time could haue serued, hee would haue shewed himselfe as braue and complete an Amorist, as the formallest Courtier in England: To this the Lady seemed no great opposite, onely with some shew of modesty depending on her brother, she referd the successe to his approbatiō, who som what too stubborne, interposed as it were a negatiue, not without exprobation of the barbarous customes of the North of Ireland, which Tirone interpreted disgracious to his exaltation, and finding no other remedy to appease his wilfulnesse, in a manner by force of armes tooke her to his wife; wherevpon hee was denied her dowry, and that exasperated his displeasure: to which when the Deputy added the suppressing of Mac Mahond his neighbour, I am afraid it exulcerated his loialty. For when hee perceiued hee was forbidden the title, to the abasing of his Family, and saw his inheritance distributed to the impouerishing his estate, he quickly startled

vp, and many displeasures discouered themselues against his former establishment, so that the Earle, by occasion of retchlesse booke-keepers cast vp his vntoward account in this manner:
            First, that the State had a purpose to suppresse the flourishing eminence both of himselfe, and all the Lords of the North: Next; that they should bee compelled to alter their Religion, and disclaime the Popes vsurped authoritie ouer the Church: Thirdly, that the Marshall Sir Henry Bagnoll had not onely prosecuted him with despightfull and malignant enmity, but iustified Articles of Treason against him: Fourthly, that he was denied the fruits of his owne labor, and honor of his industry, after he had (as hee obiected) with the losse of much blood, and expending of great Treasure of his owne, reducted the Prouince of Vlster: And last of all, that Sir William Fitz-William Lord Deputy, had not only giuen way to the malice of the Marshall, but possessed the Court of England with many vntruths against him; all which were quickly capitulated to the Dinastas of the North, his kinsmen, fauorites, and dependents, &amp; they as quickly commiserated his discontents, and meerely out of inueterate hate against vs all, contracted themselues to the maintaining the Romish Religion, and obedience to the house of Oneale, keeping yet an open correspondency with vs, though in couert their hearts (as the Lapwing cryeth farthest from her nest) stored vp as it were all prouocations of disloyalty, lying yet in waite for some aduantagious excuse, if they once were discouered.
            The first that brake the Ice of their ill contriued Rebellions was Mac Guier, a turbulent yong man, crafty, and reuengefull, who seduced by Gauranus a Priest, confirmed Primate of Ireland by the Pope, inuaded Conagh, and in insulting manner vsurped the Countrey as hee went, with full confidence, that the holy Fathers blessings should in a manner make security, and successe attend them: But the doores of Heauen were barred on the inside, excluding them as yet from any entrance, and the vertue of Sir Richard Bingham so counterchecked Mac Guiers fortunes, that hee fled discomfited,

the Primate slaine, and all his forces dispersed: Yet after a while the scattered limbs of Pelops are gathered together, and as if Anteus should recouer by touching the Earth, Mac Guier maketh a stronger party, and with some deceiueable beginnings, goes into more open Action, against whom the Earle of Tyrone himselfe was compelled to ioyne with the Marshall his only suspected enemy, and receiued a wound in that seruice: But his heart, as it should seeme, was worser hurt with priuate discontentments: For you must vnderstand that before he set forward in her Maiesties seruice, order was taken for the safe keeping of Shane Oneales children, whose deliuery hee had denied to the State, inferring by way of complaint, that the Lord Deputy and Marshall picked nothing but quarrels against him, and by new occsiaons of vnkindenesse determined to supplant him.
            Now is Sir William Fitzwilliam recalled, and Sir William Russell constituted Deputy in his stead, to whom of his owne accord the Earle of Tyrone came to submitte himselfe, with all those promises, that might induce a generous spirit to beleeue him: but the Marshall Bagnoll then present audaciously articulated. 1 That he countenanced Mac Guier and the Primats Rebellion: 2. That hee supported Odonell, and the rest of that coniuration: 3. That by the aduice of Cormach Mac Baron, his Bastard Sonne Con had coadiutement from him in the deuastation of Monaghan, and besieging of Inigkellin: 
               4. That hee corrupted the Faith and Obedience of the Captaines of Kilulto and Kilwarney: 5. And that all his protestations were counterfet and dissimulatory fictions. These were hainous obiections, and indeede deuided the Councell: For the Deputy and Marshall would haue detayned him prisoner, but the greater part eyther by vaine feare, or corrupted respects, interceded vntill a more fitter oportunity, to whom as men better acquainted with the affaires of Ireland the Lord Deputy hardly condiscended.
            So Tyrone returned home, and indeede turned as the Dog to his vomit, to his former impressed resolutions to disturbe the State, if the State disturbed him: whereupon vnderstanding

of an Army raysed in England with new supplies of 1300. Low-countrey Souldiers against him, whom that worthy and renowned Sir Iohn Norris by the famous name of Generall Norris brought out of Britany, hee not onely stood on his guard, but mustred his followers (by this time reasonably disciplin'd in the open fields, and whilst the English went against Balishanon and Belike, Castles at the further end of Logh Erne, he approched Black-water Fort, and comming on the suddaine, had it surrendered into his hands, but not with that confidence, that eyther hee relied on the security of the place, or power of his owne Army: whereupon he very politiquely one way attempted the Earle of Kildare to support him against the manifest iniuries of the Deputy and Marshall, and another way promised the Earle of Ormond and Sir Henry Wallop Treasurer, to remaine within the limits of iustifiable obedience: To this hee added the vnclasping the booke of these occurrences to Sir Iohn Norris Generall of the Army, imploring his commiseration, and as it were begging at his hands, that hee might not bee enforced to such exorbitant actions, as necessity and the law of Nature would and could contriue; but the former Letters the Marshall intercepted, and these too Generall Norris quite suppressed, which he sparingly misliked, though it fell not to his turne absolutely to finde fault withall: But when Tyrone vnderstood of these calumnious and dangerous proceedings against him, hee was put quite out of patience, exclayming, that his destruction was now on the webbe, and in the hands of a pestilent workeman, yea his aduersary wanted onely meanes to his will to contriue his vtter destruction indeede.
            Notwithstanding all this; hee put on new wings to his deceiueable hopes, and turmoyled all the Kingdome with inficious Rebellion, whereupon hee was publikely proclaymed Traytor, and enemy to the Queene, which hee professed accordingly with all correspondency of an aduersary. For in Vlster his Army consisted of a 1000. Horse, and 7000. Foote. In Conach he had (or if you wil, O Roorck and the Conners kept them together at his disposing) 200. Horse, and 2400. Foote:

In Lease and Ophaly, the number was as vncertaine, as their dispositions, being sometimes violent Rebels, and anon submissiue Subiects. In Munster they liued so dispersed, that the Gouernour found it worke enough to finde them out, and follow them: The English forces vnder Sir Iohn Norris equalled their greatest Armies, but nothing was done worthy of so great a Commanders name, and souldiers renowne. For vnder colour of priuate displeasure betweene the Deputy and him, many bad offices were performed, and the time spent to small purpose in parlies and conferences, affording Tirone such leisure, that hee contracted with Spaine, and expected from thence continuall supplies.
            But before the matter came to martiall deciding, Sir Henry Wallop Treasurer at warrs, and Sir Robert Gardner chiefe Iustice of the Kings Bench, men layd downe in the ballance of integrity, wisedome and experience, were deligated to heare the grieuances of these great Lords of the North, enforced to a defensiue warre, as they intimated, and yet obscured by the name of traytors against the State: The commiserate hearing of these compulsions, and vnquiet discourses from so dangerous a faction, returned our English Commissioners with some amazement at their oratory, and cunning insinuation, whereby they might haue excused diuers things, if by a wrong course they had not incurred the danger of contesting with Princes, yea their royall Souereigne, whose incensed Maiesty could not indure such opposition: whereupon the truce is ouerpassed, and the Trumpet of defiance sounded through the Kingdome, foreshewing, that the Schoolemaster of reformation was at hand, and Sir Iohn Norris as Lord Generall of the Armie in the absence of the Deputy, ready to display the colours of correction, but it should seeme the Deputy would needes haue a share in the glory of this businesse. For contrary to his first appointment, hee hasted apace, and vnited his troopes with Sir Iohn Norris, and so both together attended the successe of the matter, and prosperity of the time.
            The beginning was a fortunate terrifying him at Armagh,
               
and pressing him so closely, that the Earle left Black-water Fort, dismantled the Towne thereabouts, fiered some houses at Dungannon his owne principall seat, and secured himselfe in his chiefest fastnesse, winning much time by this politike retreat, but we vnexperienced in those dangerous places of his boggs and woods, with only proclaiming him Traitor in his country, and leauing Garrison in Armagh, returned, which Tirone audaciously interpreted to his owne aduantage, repining at nothing more, then our fortification in Monaghan: Thus was our businesse kept awhile out of the running current of applause. For the Deputy and the Generall of the Armie grew to some impatient contradicting one another, as if there had beene a fault committed, which was questionlesse to be imposed on one of their shoulders: wherefore the Deputy commanded, or if you wil, wished S. I. Norris to prosecute the seruice in Vlster, whilst he retired to Dubline to prouide for the peace of the other Prouinces, but it preuailed little to the lifting vp the head of the maine body. For he performed nothing worthy the glory of his former reputation or dignity of so eminent a place: But whether the emulation of the Deputy, or fauouring the Earle to whome hee was as much inclined with respect, as the Deputy transported with hate: Or whether he suspected the businesse in hand, the nature whereof, with the basenesse and intricate obscurity of the country, was so contrarious to the military proceedings elsewhere, and spent all mens spirits, without so much as the memory of manhood: or whether in inclination of fortune he began to stagger from his first firmenes, which in a customary defect dealeth strangely with such Commanders, somtimes heaping her fauours and prosperous successes, anon againe withdrawing her happy hand, and by degrees extenuating both their valour▪ fame, and iudgement, I dispute not vpon.
            Only this I am sure of, that faire errors might lead them both: For the Deputy by reason of Sir Henry Bagnols and some others despight, was brought to looke vpon a very face of disloialty in Tirone, and Sir Iohn Norris commiserated his misfortune, as abused with dissimulatory submissiue letters,

in which the Earle was ready on his knees to any penitent prostitution, when yet vnder-hand hee implored the aid of Spaine, with warrantise, that if an Army were intended against England, then to vnite their forces: if only warres were proclaymed and protraction vsed, then must the Catholike King supply them with men and money wherevpon O Roorck, Mac Williams, and others openly, and the Earle priuately subscribed to a certaine instrument of Indenture, like ratification, giuing yet notice to the State of all these contracts, and determinations, to which was added another parley with Sir Iohn Norris, and Sir Geffery Fenton Secretary in persons, full of very strange promises, and colluding protestations to runne a race of obedience and loyalty: all which accustomed Leuity hee infringed, laying imputation vpon the discrepant humors of the Deputy and Lord Generall, but especially, that his onely enemy the Marshall was returned from England with new forces, and inueterate malice against him.
            Whereupon by way of Apology, hee excused himselfe to the Councell of England, and vrged many iustifiable reasons (as he thought) for his discrepant proceedings, to which it should seem their answere was both distasting, and fearefull vnto him. For as it were exasperated rather then forewarned, he presently returned to his old courses, and taking great aduantage of our slacknesse, and ill prepared forces, spoiled the country, filled all the paces with Rebels, Barrocaded the passages, and with military excursions ran an vncontroulable iourney of doing what he pleased through the North.
            Thus was all Vlster and most part of Conach (excepting certain Garrisons) at his absolute command, vntil the Lord Borrough 1597. a man of a great spirit and quick capacity was sent Deputy into Ireland, from whose worth some auspicious expectation seemed to comfort vs, and new endeuours in a manner to warrant new fortunes: This sonne of Mars quickly pulled off the clogs of delay, &amp; within two moneths rolled the stone of Tirones vnquietnesse, making way with great industrie and vertue into his country, fortifying the Fort of

Black-water, and discouering this secret, that neyther his Boggs, Glinns, Woods, Mountaines, Paces, Confederats, or any power of Ireland, or Irish coadiutors could hide him from the searching eyes of England. Besides, if we would vndertake an industrious prosecution against him, it was neyther Spayne with her Gold, nor the Pope with his Fulminations against our Countrey, could secure him. For the farre reaching armes of our people would for a neede pull him out of the Center of the Earth: and thus accordingly euen at the first skirmishes were his forces dissipated, and the best troopes disranked: but as my Lord was giuing God thankes with a warlike solemnity, a sudden Alarum set them anew to worke, and Henry Earle of Kildare with the Gent. Volentiers had the Fortune to put him againe to flight, which yet yeelded not so full a satisfaction, as it might haue done, because my Lord lost his brother in Law Francis Vaughan and Captaine Turner Sergeant Maior, besides the Earle of Kildare to the sorrow of his heart saw two of his brethren wrapped vp in the Bed of blood, all men of worthy expectation, and extraordinary Merit.
            Thus is a way made into his Countrey, and Black-water Fort strengthened with new trenches, not without some ramparts, and Caffamates, which the enemy so repined at, that betweene hope, feare, and shame, they resolued to dismantle it, had not the Lord Deputy opened more larger embracings, and with a new manner of wrestling resolued to lay him on the ground irrecouerably: but hinc illae lachrimae! as he was treading the measures of prosperity, an vntimely discord of Death sounding Musike deceiued him of hope, and vs of him, whose forwardnes and vertue with a little addition of experience, and solid vnderstanding himselfe, had no doubt effectuated this Herculian labour of Irelands peace.
            Now is Tyrone putting on his Icarean wings, and the Rebell with accustomed Clamors taking aduantage of this Interim, assaulted Black-water Fort, but therein commanded that industrious Captaine Th. Williams, who at the same instant by meere valour, and resolution propulsed them, and many

times after, by patience and constancy endured all those mischiefes, where by a Souldier is put to the test, and enemy maketh demonstration of his hate and policy. For when the Irish found themselues vncapable of such a businesse, by way of expugnation, or assault, they tooke another course by intercepting the passages to famish them; which when the English vnderstood, they were as resolute to affront all mischances, as the enemy was violent in contriuing displeasures, and so with noble stedfastnesse bare vp a head against the streame of sicknesse, and wants, eating Horses and Weedes, and if it had beene possible, the very durt and stones.
            In this time the gouernment of Ireland was in the hands of the Earle of Ormond, as Lieutenant Generall of the Army: the Lord Chancelor and Sir Robert Gardner Iustices, to whom the Earle of Tyrone by many dilatory Letters did lay open all his grieuances, touching sparingly his breach of promise with Sir Iohn Norris, and all the effectuall points of his disobedience, and refractary courses: To these Letters hee receiued answere, which hee interpreted displeasing rather then satisfactory, and so accordingly entred into further Rebellious actions, pressing Black-water Fort again with a more dangerous siedge, against whom the Lord Lieutenant and Iustices aforesaid sent Sir Henry Bagnoll the Marshall, his only reputed aduersary, with sixteene Companies of Foot, and foure troops of Horse, who aduancing forward more malicious then fortunate, as ouerwrought by a predestinated wilfulnesse, came to blowes, and according to the slippery footing of Warre, fel to a dangerous Skirmish, in which Tyrone shouldred him with all his strength nigh vnto Armagh, determining as it were to punish his Enuy, and supposed abuses against him, wherein it should seeme the Mistrisse of successe (as we abuse Gods prouidence by the Character of Fortune) was coadiutrix, and displayed all the maligne circumstances of reuenge against vs. For ere night decided the controuersy, hee triumphed with a notorious victory, whereby in one houre the Marshall ended his brauery, life, and enmity: nor could the Irish euer boast of a more conspicuous triumph since the Conquest, or if

you had rather haue it so, since we first curb'd their immanity: For we lost fifteene Captaines, and 1500. Souldiers, ouer whom the manner of insulting was more barbarous then the accident tyrannous.
            Presently followed the surrendring of Black-water Fort, when the besieged saw all reliefe debarred them, and heard, how Tyrone was proclaymed the deliuerer of his Countrey and Protector of the Catholique cause, seeming the very darling of prosperity and delight of Bellona, wherein he proceeded accordingly, making all the Kingdome witnesse his glory and renowne. For hee presently sent Ouny-Mac Roory Oge, and Tirrill into Munster with foure thousand Rebels, against whom the Lord President Sir Iohn Norris (hauing lost his brother by sicknesse, or as some suppose, a disastrous Melancholy) with reasonable equipage, and orderly attendance set nobly forward: but the enemy not appearing, he retired to Corck, and diuiding his Army into seuerall Garrisons, gaue them liberty to take aduantage of our wearisomnesse and impatience. For presently they proceeded to all hatefull courses of sauage outrage, and after Iames Fitz-Thomas a Rebell of that House was proclaymed Earle of Desmond, who thereupon acknowledged Oneale his benefactor, and superior, they returned with ambitious alacrity, and cheerefulnesse, and sent word into Spayne of their admirable successes, wherein Tyrone behaued himselfe so audaciously, that he interdicted the peace of England, as if there had beene a way opened vnto an easy conquest of the same, and the first steppe into Ireland would helpe them vp the degrees of a more illustrious glorie, to which purpose the King of Spayne should not onely bee assured of the Popes blessing, but Oneales Fortunes and assistance, yea the whole power of the Kingdome.
            This was the lamentable estate of Ireland, when her Maiesty taking pitty of her Orphan Countrey, substituted Robert Earle of Essex, whom the successe of Cales voyage, and many other memorable designes and prosecutions had worthily renowned, her Lieutenant Generall of Ireland: But how hee had formerly wound himselfe into the good opinion of his

Countrey, how England looked vpon him as a glorious sonne of comlinesse and honour, how his forces, Treasure, and Fauours were extraordinary in this proiect of Ireland, how hee proceeded in this military race, how the applause of the people, and the greatest part of the nobilitie attended him: How a sudden storme, as if some ominous signe from Heauen presaged misfortune, intercepted his iollity euen at his first setting out of London: how landed in Ireland hee beganne his businesse as preposterously: How that braue Sir Coniers Clifford was abused by presumption, and ouer-credulous opinion, that his bosome friend O Roorck would not haue prooued such a Traytor, and so not only lost his life at the Curlews a boggy Mountaine by the Abby of Aborle: but was inhumanely after the skirmish mangled, and with great immanity cut in peeces: How the Earle of Ormond, and Sir Henry Harington were surprized and taken prisoners by Harry Oge: Owny mac Roory, and the sonnes of Feff mac-Heugh rebells vnited against the peace and flourishing prosperity of Lemster: How hee came to a priuate parley with Tyrone, and was much affected by the Irish: How her Maiesty rebuked him, and from incensed indignation challenged both his loyalty, and the wisedome of the Councell of Ireland for a contrarious and vntoward method of gouernment, and prosecutions in the North: How his glorious celebrating the feast of Saint George in the City of Dubline, considering the times and turmoyles of the kingdome, was imputed rather an ostentous brauery, then a necessary honour: How contrary to expectation hee comes into England after a priuate prohibition by her Maiesties owne Letters: How hee was commanded to his owne House, and his Offices dispensed withall: How his sorrows multiplied: How the peoples loue encreased eyther from a generall commiserating of such men in distresse, or particular apprehension of his greatnesse, and worth: How his fortunes and Life ended: I will leaue to a Story of it selfe, yea if I might say so, to many Stories, in which such infinite obseruations might bee folded, that if a man durst or might spread them abroad, all the passages should be laid open and

exposed to publique ouerlooking, of the fauour and disfauor of Princes, the dangers of men insatiable of glory, the condition of Councellours, emulous of one anothers greatnesse, the mutability and inconstancy of popularitie, the perill wherein men plunge themselues, that dare presume to perpetrate vniustifiable actions, and the misery, which an vntimely death bringeth to a man projecting high matters to himselfe. But to our Irish businesse againe.
            When my Lord of Essex troubles were published abroad and divulged in Ireland: the Earle of Tirone with great indignation brake the truce of his Country, raised his forces, mustred his Rebells, rumored the inuasion of England by Spaine, and audaciously set open all the passages of war and defiance, whereupon the Traytours increased both in pride and numbers, and those which were meere Irish, expected their pristinate liberty: such againe as had settled their estates, either by purchase or gift of the Prince, began to misdoubt themselues, when they perceiued such a confluence and concurrence of tumultuary businesse to the detriment of the Kingdome: yea, I am afrayd they were without all hope in their hearts, when Tirone proclaimed himselfe Protector of Ireland, and Maintainer of the Catholique Religion: nor was this onely titular, and a formall tricke of vaine promises and flattering friends. For he proceeded accordingly, imperiously managing all affaires vnder his gouernment: the rebellious he moderated, the weake supported, the strong confirmed, the staggering reduced, the wilfull punished, and (in a word) applied himselfe altogether to the extirpation of the English: whereunto he was animated, by assured intelligence of preparations in Spaine, and the receiuing a competent treasure from thence. Nor wanted there certaine indulgences and promises from the Pope, to set his desire on a blaze: but when for a present hee had receiued an hollowed Phoenix plume, with Ixion that boasted of lying with Iuno, being yet deceiued with the shape of a clowd, hee presaged good fortune, and ranne away with full confidence of successe, and the rather, because hee remembred, how Vrban the third had sent King Iohn a

crowne of peacockes feathers at his designation, for the Lordship of Ireland.
            
            Thus marched he ouer the Countrey, with extraordinarie preuailing, and vnaccustomed pomp, for an Irish Commander, with new publications of his regardable proceedings, and Princely confirmations. And to adde fuell to that fire, which in his absence was kindled in Munster, he went thither in person, and vnder colour of visiting a peece of the crosse of Christ in Tiperary, attempted further, sending Mac-Guior to forage the country, who chancing on Sr. Warrham Selenger, fell to blowes, and in gallant encounter, charged one another so brauely, that with their staues they equally received their deaths wounds through their bodies, which a while curbed Tirones headstrongnesse, and peraduenture was cause of his sooner retiring home, after he had celebrated Mac-Guiors exequies: but in truth the aduertisement of the Earle of Ormonds comming against him with all the English forces rebated his first forwardnesse, and made him suspect all was not so well as he wished: but yet animated by many superstitious presages, and giuing all credit to his Bards and Rimers, of which sort of people, especially if I adde the Priests, I will bee bolde to say thus much, that they are the very bane and confusion of Ireland, liuing in such obscenity and filthinesse, that no Gentlewoman thinketh herselfe happy without them, and supposeth it no disgrace euen to bee prostituted vnto them: Insomuch, that ill custome (besides the intolerable yoke of superstition, to which these people are out of measure addicted) hauing got the vpperhand, these insorcering wretches at marriages, feasts, births of children, contracts, burialls, and peraduenture all their liues time, challenge certaine priuiledges, immunities and gifts; yea, priuacies with the women, and imperious ouerruling the men: So that as their families encrease in mightinesse, these damnable creatures prosper in reputation, as if all blessings depended vpon their incantations and prayers, &amp; no action could thriue without their crossings and sanctifying: So that (in my conscience) the most of the rebells and strumpets amongst them, are the bastards of these

rogues and vagabonds: and all the treasons, which haue turmoiled our Nation, haue receiued life and originall from their imposturing and perswasions.
            By this time is Sr. Charles Blunt Lord Montioy confirmed Deputy of Ireland, on whom long since the Queene had looked with respect for the same purpose: But the Earle of Essex proposing to himselfe the managing of all military affaires, somewhat couertly impugned the same, extenuated his experience in the warres, and that hee onely had a view of some skirmishes in the Low Countries: Besides, his spirit was not stirring enough to curb such a Nation, as giuen ouer much to his booke, and a kinde of retired melancholy, rather fit for ciuill gouernment, then violent hurliburlies: All which wiped not yet out the print of her good opinion; but shee went forward in her choyce, and made the election more notable, because her owne iudgement affoorded sufficient reason of his merit: onely she proposed before him, by way of caution, my Lord of Essex wilfulnesse, and in a manner presumption, practizing diuers things against her liking and prescription, and so alike restrained his commission, and by word of mouth commanded his charines and wisdom, concerning the knighting of men, which must needes be vilipended, brought once to a community; as for any hinderances, by the maleuolent aspect of single Councellours, shee promised on her Princely word, that shee would bee the Queene of her Kingdome, and no man should contract a brow of mislike, or preuaile in any secret information against him: whereupon hee was much comforted, and well hoped, that that enmity which was whispered betweene Mr. Secretary and him, I meane Sr. Robert Cecill, might be easily reconciled, and (as it were) like the swet of a mans browes wiped away with a gentle hand, which accordingly came to passe. For when certaine honest men performed good offices betweene them, neuer man obserued such a Councellour of State, better than my Lord did him, nor such a greatnesse honoured a person in such an eminent place, then Mr. Secretary did my Lord: so that to their dying dayes their friendship was indissoluble, and as they loued

one another, so both respected the glory of their country before one another.
            Thus without any publique ostentation, or great attendancy, in the month of February 1600. he tooke his iourney toward Ireland, and was welcommed to our true-hearted English, as you see a famous Physician presented to a sicke patient, who hath long expected his comming. For hee found Ireland so desperate languishing, that he rather feared her funerals then recouery, which must bee so at this instant, considering the very best did droop with despaire, and the worst insulted with pride: Tyrone passed and repassed without controll, and the Rebell had nothing in his mouth, but the Spanish Inuasion, and that Tyrone should bee the Prince of their Countrey vnder the Catholique King: whereupon to exasperate the new Deputy, and terrifie him at the first, they gaue an assault to the suburbs of Dublin, and the Alarum rung euen to the Castle, where my Lord was resident, which indeede so much incensed him, that he resolued to intercept his returne out of Munster, whatsoeuer chanced; and so gathering together the rest of the dispersed forces, and taking along such Gentlemen as came with him out of England, he marched into Fereall (for you must consider the maine army was with my Lord of Ormond in Munster) and determined to see the manner of Tyrones returning home into his Countrey, but was preuented by the admirable expedition hee made. For certified of all our proceedings, not without some ampliation of my Lords power and authority, as in all such cases it happens, that new Gouernours are not onely extolled, but an army of a thousand by poll, shall be made two thousand by report, he quickly procured a shelter for the storme which was threatned, and euen ready to powre vpon him, and so taking the way of Lease, and the skirts of Meath, posted into the North.
            
            When my Lord Deputy was thus frustrated of his expectation, he returned to Dublin, and after orderly consultation, concluded to send forces by sea to Logh-Foile and Balishanon, as also to Logh-Erne, to visit Lease and Ophaly, to restore

               Munster, and fortifie Conach, which as they were designes of wonderfull consequence; so must as wonderfull wisdome of men, and prouidence of God effectuate the same, and bring to a happy period. Thus was all Ireland, like a turbulent sea full of billowes, euen to the very shores, and the Rebell vexed both Countrey and Inhabitants: the country was spoiled, ouerrunne, and in most parts depopulated; insomuch that in diuers places, twenty mile together, not so much as a bird appeared; the inhabitants were slaine, rauished, enforced, and robbed: insomuch that neither house, nor Church, except some few castles and townes in speciall mens hands, remained vpright: but were burnt, ruined, and deuasted.
            When my Lord Deputy (to make my first simile hold correspondency) felt the pulses so strong of this disquieted body, and vnderstood the state of the same by outward and inward demostration: his principall care was, to reduce the distemperature, and coole the heat, if it were possible, of this burning feauer; for which purpose hee conferred with the Councell, and after orderly and prouident furnishing his army with munition, garons, and seuerall prouision: he determined in person, and with all speedinesse, sometimes the onely strength and life of all difficult enterprizes, to encounter the enemy; but especially to diuert Tyrone from intercepting Sr. Henry Dockeray, at Logh-Foile; and Sr. Matthew Morgan, at Balishanon: whereupon in the beginning of May (an early time to bring an army into the field) hee marched toward Vlster, and pressed the Rebell with so many skirmishes, that they were wonderfully dispersed, and against all expectation confounded: Thus had hee leasure, in the midst of Iune, to march backe againe into Lease, the onely refuge of the Rebels of Lemster, where with admirable successe he preuailed against that turbulent, cruell, and bloudy young man Ony-Mac-Roory-Oge, the cheefe of the family of O-more, who had so lately disturbed the peace of all Munster; to whom, with other his most pestilent and impious confederates, did our Deputy read a lesson of Iustice, and taught rebellion other principles of conformity, then either they were willing to learne, or had

beene before orderly enstructed in: by which occasion Bellona began to giue vs better entertainment, and already there appeared a declining of the others prosperity: Thus was the God of battells propitious vnto vs, and the sunne of comfort by degrees chased away the foggy mists of despaire and despight; so that euery mans heart was cheered, and they which held downe their heads full low in the time of mistrust and affliction, I meane the Irish-English themselues in the pale, beganne to stand vpright for ioy, and flocked to the court in troops, to welcome my Lord Deputy home, and applauded the prosperity of his attempts; yea, to speake without flattery, to impute the happinesse to his vertue and wisdome.
            In the midst of this iollity, new supplies out of England gaue more aire to successe, which had beene so long smoothered betweene malignant circumstances of time, and ill conditions of men deuoted to priuate ends. For this is most certaine, that in the vncertainty of our preuailing, when the gouernment of Ireland seemed layd at the stake, howeuer the better sort kept correspondency with vs, and professed a kinde of glory in participating with our misfortunes, yet did they vnderhand not onely releeue Tyrone, but contracted for their owne security, if any alteration should chance; yea, in some of our extremities, they behaued themselues so audaciously, and yet with an vntoward policy, that when they were sent for to march with the army, they made dilatory excuses, and many times denied such attendance, as if they had businesse sufficient to keepe their owne territories from robbery and spoiles. But our worthy Deputy againe, with these new troops, he vndertooke the iourney of the Moiry, three miles beyond Dondalk: and attempted an impetuous assault, which continued with many dangerous and violent skirmishes. For his horse was shot vnder him, his Secretary slaine by him, his friends wounded, and diuers Commanders hurt; yet he endured all, and the God of heauen endured him, so that at the last, with a memorable slaughter and fortunate victory, hee enforced them from his fastnesse.
            Presently finding sweet beginnings to breath life into actions,

he marched to Armagh, and tumbled those hindrances on to side, which had made that passage so noysome, and because he would maintaine an old position:

                  Non minor est virtus, quam quaerere, parta tueri:
               
He built a fort called Mount Norris, within eight miles of the Newry, and in a manner the mid-way to Armagh, in honour of that worthy Generall, vnder whom he was introducted on the martiall theater. In his returne (passing ouer many light skirmishes) neere vnto Carlingford, hee preuailed with a memorable defeature of the rest, and so stored the castles with strong wards, making the narrow water passible, and sending the pestilent Kerne lurking in euery corner, to seeke for better shelter. For these new and terrible stormes, had shattered their olde couerts, and almost beaten them to peeces ouer their heads.
            Not long after, in the midst of winter, he coasted into the Glins by Dublin, where Donnell-Spaniah-Phelin, and Raymond-Mac-Feugh, with that pestilent rabble of O-Tooles, held such a quarter, that no man before him had either leisure to disranke them, or sufficient forces to raise them from their firmnesse: these yet he subdued, reduced, and led them by strong hand to such a way of obedience, that Sir Henry Harrington vnder him went quietly to Newcastle, and had the principall command ouer them; yea, I can assure you were glad to be inuited to the pleasures of his peace and entertainment, and Raymond-Mac-Feugh, as I take it, was his tenant for Baltinglas, and gloried in nothing more, then that hee had sworne himselfe a true subiect to the Maiestie of England.
            
            Lastly, he hasted into Feriall, where the Rebell Tirrell was pulled out of his darke corners into the open light of discomfiture, and in the end compelled into Vlster, to the great Cōmander of their facinorous enterprizes, whither his Lordship followed with admiration, and preuailed with all the aduantages of a fortunate Captaine. For, in truth, he attempted nothing▪ but preuailed: and with the Centurion in the Gospell, said to this man, go; and he went: to that, do this; and he did it: so that if a man would then haue catalogued his particular,

hee might thus haue set downe the Items of his account, which I am the bolder to doe, because I cannot incurre the imputation of flattery, not a man remaining, that I know, to reward me, nor will not obscure the worthinesse of vertue in a Generall so compleat and well assisted by all the properties of honour and renowne.
            First then, (yet I doe not presume of order, nor tie my selfe to the strictnesse of time) hee conquered the Feriall, by the death of the two sonnes of Euer-Mac-Codey. Hee subdued the Rebels of the Fuse, and receiued to grace Turlogh-Mac-Henry: he laid open the Breny, and taught vs a way to march ouer their boggs, yea to bring our cannons ouer their deepest mires, as my selfe was an eye-witnesse in Conagh before O-Kellies owne castle: he restored Tredagh, and made those vnconstant people ashamed of their willingnesse to become hispaniolized: hee reduced Leiale, pardoning Magennis that vsurped there, and set open their prowdest fastnes: yea, their paces and mountaines were made easie, in despight of natures difficulties and mens policies: hee tooke to mercy Mac-Mahond, and the O-Realies, knighting that olde Sr. Patrick O-Hanland, and corroborating all their loues as farre as he went: hee expelled the Rebells from Armagh, fortifying the same with English, and came to Blackwater Sconce, where Tirone was very cunningly encamped: but arsdeluditur arte, and he remooued him in despight, casting vp more sufficient trenches, and left it once againe in the fast holding armes of Captaine Th: Williams: hee made Lease and Ophaly proud of their peace and prosperity: so that the Inhabitants still gathered themselues vnder the couert of English protection: he set open the Glins, and made the Brens and Tooles, with other inficious Rebells ashamed to put any confidence in deuices, or reaches of mens braines. For God had ordained the pride of life, to be subiect to alteration, and the presumption of men to bee patible of counterchecking. To conclude, in a word, howeuer other men were vertue-worthy, and valiant enough: yet this our Lord Montioy was questionlesse more fortunate, as wee are sensible of that terme, then any man since Sr. Henry Sidney's
               
times, yet I may not ouerpasse that memorable Lord Grey, whose noble spirit seemed to flie in the face of his enemies, and dimmed the sight of the Spanyards in Smirwick and other places of Ireland, who had in those times a determination to pry into euery corner of the Countrey, and settle the authority of their great Master amongst vs, if it were possible. Thus Fortune ashamed of her first churlish entertainment, welcommed him to the pleasures of a more conuenient lodging, and gaue vs all hope of his perpetuity in the palace of reputation, which in that manner, as you haue heard, hee tooke possession of.
            
               Tirone, notwithstanding, was not altogether exanimated: for what he could not with the lyons, her performed with the foxes skin, and according to an olde filthy principle:

                  Tutum per scelera sceleribus est iter:
               
He cared not what course he tooke, or tracke hee paced in, so England might be disturbed, and his owne fortunes and greatnesse maintained: whereupon, as in many places you haue heard, hee tampered with Spaine for the corroborating his power, and imploying many Agents, who brought the Popes letters to the same purpose, effected thus much; that money was sent him, as a preparation, and money should follow, as a full purgation of the diseases of his discontentment, which made him stand the more remote from reconciliation, &amp; vilipend my Lord Deputy, as the Substitute of England, whom yet he honoured and admired, as the indefatigable seruant of honour, which Epitheton I must needs vse, because howeuer iolly spirits, viewing onely city musters, cry out,

                  Dulce bellum inexpertis,—
               
Yet in the worthinesse of fearefull imployment, is this an occupation beyond report, and no Labourer, Pioner, or Artificer in any mechanicke trade, did euer take such paines, as my Lord: but I may well say with the Poet,

                  Hectora quis nosset? foelix si Troia fuisset?
                  Ardua per preceps gloria tendit iter:
               
For amongst other vertues in a Generall, patience and perseuerance are the true touch-stones of the currantnesse of the

rest: now because fortune would needs search him throughly, to make triall of his constancy, or to increase his glory, the certainty of the Spanyards landing in Munster, and onely life of Tirones whole actions, taxed him with further businesse, and fixed all the eyes of the Kingdome, both honest and irresolute, vpon his proceedings heerein, and hopefull successe to preuaile vnexpected.
            But how in this negotiation a Spanyard designed by the Pope to be Archbishop of Dublin, the Bishop of Clenfart, the Bishop of Killalow, and Arthur a Iesuite, with Owen were employed: How the landing at Carlingford, or some ports of the North onely aduantagious to the proiect of the conquest of the whole Kingdome, was proposed most befitting this purpose: How Don Iohn de Aquila Zerigo, and 6000. souldiers, attempted this inuasion, the first taking Kinsale by composition, the other fortifying Beerhauen, Castlehauen, and Baltimore: How they sent away their owne ships, either fearing our surprizing, or assuring their company, there was no meanes of escape, or retiring backe againe: How all Ireland was amazed, and those which wished vs well in their hearts, were yet confounded with the report of Spaines ouerprized greatnesse: How we thickned our selues into a clowd of opposition, by gathering all the airy vapors of our forces, or at least so many, as might be spared to make the storme the greater: How we encamped before Kinsale, and at one time (when Sr. George Cary Lord Gouernour of Munster, was appoynted to intercept, or (if you will) to ouerview Tirones passages, comming forward with great iollity to ioyn with these Spanyards) were not so many in our trenches without, as the enemy numbred in Kinsale within: How at last Tirone (Tirone I say) with 6000. foot, &amp; 600. horse, came forward within the view of our camp, to vnite their forces together, &amp; exasperated our displeasure with many outcries &amp; branado's: How Sr. Henry Dauers General of our horse, made a gallant sally against him, till according to their accustomed shuffling, they retired into a wood: How the Queens ships blocked vp the hauen at Kinsale, and Sir Richard Luson in person assaulted Zerigo &amp; 2000.

               Spanyards, stuffed in the seuerall castles and harbours of Beerhauen, Castlehauen, and Baltimore, as formerly recited, and battered the walls so forcibly from his ships (the hauens lying so commodiously for the purpose) that the enemy wondred at his worthinesse, and thought that their Lady of Heauen was willing to affect vs on earth. Howeuer foureteene seuerall sallies and skirmishes to blocke vp our cannons, and defeat our approaches, impetuously draue vs to encounters, on Christmas euen a most memorable victory chanced on our side: How, for many dayes together, it lightned and thundred accordingly, as if the stones from heauen should fall on Sisera's head on our behalfe: How that worthy Earle of Clenricard was knighted onely of all the army before the walls of Kinsale, when the Spanyards colours formerly surprized, were flourished as a token of thanksgiuing for so prosperous successe: How my Lord of Tomond, and many worthy Gentlemen of his Countrey lay close vnto the towne, and in our last approaches, sued for the honour-poynt, as we tearme it, to assault the same after the battery: How the Spanyard on the New-yeeres day following, sent their Drum Maior to entreat a parlee, and afterward grew to a composition: How at last they departed, and were shipped by vs vnder the ouer-looking of Captaine Cotes, who set safe on shore Don Iohn de Aquila, and the rest at the Groine: How the Irish retired, dispersing themselues into their seuerall fastnesse and couerts: I will not heere enlarge, because you haue many discourses, and a iournall written to the same purpose.
            You shall onely now bee certified, what this angry Ionas did, after his gourd was withered, and how with others of that sort, he drenched himselfe in the whirlepoole of confusion, when his Spanish props were shrunke, or bladders taken away. His first retreat was into such countryes, and to such persons, as he was sure of releefe, both from the nature of charity and commiseration, and the bond of duty and former gratuity; from whence with some adoe, (because his souldiers were rather men looking after a prey, then subiect to the disaster of a defeat) hee got home againe with little interception of our

side, the army as yet resident at Corcke, or thereabouts, but when he came to Dungannon, the walls seemed to weepe for his disaster, that well hoped to haue beene new coloured with the trophees of his rebellion.
            My Lord Deputy returned to Dublin. and as it was requisite and most necessary, celebrated St. Georges Feast, and by way of thanksgiuing welcommed all the Gentlemen of the Pale, who durst not but giue God the praise, and him the renowne of the victory: by which occasion Tirones proceedings had no such couerture, but they all (as it were) in a glasse, saw the change and alteration of fortune, making this vse thereof, that there is no confidence in worldly prosperity; Nor must a man be too much elated, though terrestriall blessings seeme to make his cup to ouerflow. For the man, that of late proclaimed himselfe Protector of the ancient liberty of Ireland, and Defender of the Romish Religion, that for the same purpose led whole armies into the field, and displayed the coulours of a most dangerous innouation: that posted and reposted through the Kingdome at his pleasure, as if Maiesty meant to kisse him in the chaire of successe: that was glorious in the eyes of his owne people, famous to other Nations, and a very terrour to the English Inhabitants of Ireland: that was coadiuted with the purse, nauy, countenance, and an army of six thousand well appoynted souldiers from a mighty Prince: that was emboldned with the loue and admiration of his own followers: that tooke aduantage of our first slacke proceedings to debilitate his insolence, and that promised himselfe the very harbour of felicity, as being in the high way of establishment; was now subiect to distresse, and bowed vnder the burthen of mischance, and vntoward alteration.
            For my Lord Deputy presently followed him into his owne countrey, and, as I remember the brauery of Charles the fifth, vpon his writing of Plus vltra, when the West Indies were discouered, where as before the great Hercules had set vp his pillers at Gades in Spaine, with this inscription: Non plus vltra: so may I apply it vnto this our Generall, who comming now to Blackwater Fort, cried Plus vltra, wheras before none

of our Deputies could euer step three miles beyond: But Montioy mounted with ioy euen to the walls of Dung
                     •
                  nnon, and pitched his tents in the fields of Tirone, expelling the great Rebell from his owne house, and taking possession of the same, and all the territories, for the vse of the Queene his Mistresse: and although in a perillous encounter by the Lough, attempting to sapp the strong castle of the same, well stored with Rebells, he lost that valiant kinsman of his Sr. Iohn Barkley Sergeant Maior, of whose worthinesse one of the starrs of our Countrey, George Earle of Cumberland, had good experience in his voyage to St. Port Ricco: yet apprehending the chance of warre, and condition of mortality, he was no whit affrighted or troubled; but rather exasperated to reuenge: whereupon he set fire of their cabbins and townes, entred the very castle of Dungannon, rifled the same, and although hee was wronged with a strange report of obtaining great treasure, yet I beleeue he brought home one little guilt bason and eure of siluer, a madder tipped with siluer and guilt, and some rotten hangings, more memorable for a trophee, then seruiceable for any glorious vse. In the fulnes of this prosperity, he built the Fort of Mountioy, &amp; fortified in many places of this dangerous country, driuing him with the rest of his followers into more remote places▪ and the obscure corners of his Glan Cancones, to which when he added the cutting vp of the corn, which the cheerefull souldiers performed with their swords, and taking away their cowes, of which they had good store, it is admirable to tell you what miseries followed, and the whole people endured. For their sword-men perished with sicknesse and famine the next yeere following, and the poore Calliots deuoured one another for meere hunger, and shewed vs the lamentable effects of a calamitous warre and afflicted Countrey.
            Thus was Tirone made the tennis-ball of fortune, and abandoned of Spaines ouerprized greatnesse: thus did hee see the losse of his armies, and the miseries of his people: thus was he deiected from the pride of his possessions, and repined to behold his aduersary seated in his castles and townes:

thus was hee forsaken of his friends, kinred, and complices, and confined into the vncouth and remote places of his bogs and woods: thus was hee afraid of betraying, euen of those which leaned on his bosome▪ especially when the state bandited him, and valued his head at a thousand pound sterling, and his body aliue at two thousand pound: and thus was hee made the scorne of alteration, and spectacle of humane condition, hauing nothing left but a poore disconsolate life, which it should seeme the Law of nature assisted him to maintaine, otherwise a Romane spirit, in spight of mischance, had ouercome distresse with a glorious death.
            But time had not fully ripened as yet his fruit, nor brought forward the haruest, that should gather in this dispersed corne: For this great tormented Rebell, with strange demisnesse, sought his peace at the hands of his long abused Soueraigne, &amp; with new teares begged a new life, nor was this submission ordinary after the custom of a souldiers misfortune▪ but (as it were) blotted with the spots of a guilty cōscience, &amp; interlined with a strange manner of feareful penitency, repleat with execrations against the cause of his misleading, and terrors of his offence, not without teares from his eyes, drops of bloud from his heart, and curses from his very soule, in demonstration of his remorse, with protestations of better conformity, with vowes and dangerous oaths for his loyalty, with confident assurances for his obedience, and with all the cunning that art, meanes, circumstances, and insinuation accustometh in attracting pardon.
            This strange newes was nothing acceptable to her Maiesty: For shee had rather haue seene his body on the ground headlesse, then himselfe succourlesse and on his knees begging of pardon, because my Lord of Essex had promised as much, and out of her owne greatnesse, shee scorned to bee so affronted with a subiect, and naked Rebell, as she might well terme him: yea, the Councell of her State had many times vrged the facility of the matter, and suggested against my Lord of Essex, by way of exaggerating his offences, with this one slacknesse in the midst of his troubles: so that now to

take him to mercy, after so much treasure disbursed, so many subiects slaine, so vntoward disturbance renewed, so wonderfull reports dispersed, so famous an action discredited, and in a word, the whole frame of her gouernment abused; was an vnsauoury demand, &amp; absolutely contrary to her expectation, especially when shee had beene wrought to the permission of her copper treasure in Ireland, esteemed the breake-necke of the Rebells designes, and a meere demonstration of our wants in England.
            
            But when the Councell vrged the necessity of the time, the situation of the Countrey, the fearefulnesse of further mischeefe, the inconueniences of new troubles, the threatning of the Spanyard, the new intercession of the Papists for another inuasion, the discontents of the Irish themselues, for all these triumphs: her princely disposition was ouerwrought to a reflecting commiseration▪ so that against the customes of incensed Maiesty, shee admitted of his prostituted homage, and with some wonderment at the wretchednesse of Traytours, and vicissitude of all things, she gaue way to his restitution, with directions to the Deputy, to entertaine him accordingly, so he made sute for the same, and that it might appeare to the world, she was an absolute Queene of her Kingdomes, and howeuer Rebells might haue ttayterous hearts supported by forrain coadiutement, yet could no subiect haue powerfull hands to pull the peace of her kingdomes in peeces, or touch the skirts of her throne to disturb her in her established mightinesse.
            When Tirone vnderstood, that he must alter his compasse, and turne his sailes to another coast, hee then imployed his brother Arthur Mac Baron, and others of the best of his family, and neerest of his affinity, as Agents of his peace and protection, who diuers times repulsed, when remembrance layd open his former exorbitant actions, desisted not yet from excuses of precedent occurrences, and forcible intimation of the necessity of his present actions, nor left they out the true manner of his now penitency, and all their willingnesse to make him, as it were, a new creature, and vnite themselues

in one combination for the acknowledging the superiority of England: whereby at last that obdurate heart of our Deputy, which at first seemed impenetrable, was deflected and cast in a more gentle molde, so that he appoynted Mellifant by Tredagh, where Sir Garret Moore was resident, to bee the schoole house of his conformity, and place without other condition, then submitting to the Queenes mercy, to admit of his repentance: whither, at the time appointed, resorted our noble Lord Deputy well attended, for the better grace of his eminent greatnesse, and the person he presented: thither came also Tirone with some few Lords of the North, a spectacle of mischance and terrour to the pride of man, who supposeth glory and ostentation the felicity of this world, or presumeth on wealth and authority, the very poison of our best endeauours: Nor was it with him, as I remember the excusing Poet in his disticke touching offenders cries out:

                  Confugit interdum templi violator ad aram,
                  Nec petere offensi niminis horret opem:
               
For, as the case stood, his offence and fault was the more hainous and condemnatory, because his Prince was a woman, and one to whom he had diuers times been beholding for his life, and in the doubtfulnesse of his first admission to his enheritances, saw the dore of her treasury and magnificent bounty set open for him. But to the purpose.
            At the first entrance into the roome, euen at the threshold of the doore, hee prostrated himselfe groueling to the earth, with such a deiected countenance, that the standers by were amazed, and my Lord Deputy himselfe had much a doe to remember the worke in hand. For whether the sight of so many Captaines and Gentlemen, whether ashamed of himselfe, when he saw such a number of his owne nation spectators of his wretchednesse, whether the consideration of his fortunes, that had thus embased him contrary to expectation: whether the view of my Lord to be his Iudge, whom once he reputed to be at his mercy: whether hee repented this course of submission, and degenerating begging of life, when a noble death had beene both honourable, and the determiner of

misery: or whether mans naturall imperfection, to bee confounded and altred with affliction, depressed his spirits, I know not, but it was one of the deplorablest sights that euer I saw: and to looke vpon such a person, the author of so much trouble, and so formerly glorious, so deiected, would haue wrought many changes in the stoutest heart, and did no doubt at this instant raise a certain commiseration in his greatest aduersary.
            After a while the Deputy beckned him to come neere: beleeue it, hee arose: but with such degrees of humility, as if misfortune had taught him cunning to grace his aduersity. For he passed not two steps, before hee yeelded to a new prostitution, which might well bee called a groueling to the ground, and so, by diuided ceremonies, fell on his knees, beginning an apology for some of his actions, but at euery word confessing, in how many treasons hee had plunged himselfe, offending God and her Maiesty, how hee had abused her fauours, disturbed her Kingdome, disobeyed her lawes, wronged her subiects, abandoned all ciuility, and wrapped himselfe in the very tarriers of destruction; so that nothing remained, but to flie to the refuge of her Princely clemency, which had so often restored both his life and honour.
            Heere my Lord Deputy intercepted his oratory, with disclaiming all circumlocution, or defence of the courses he had so disorderly vndertaken; nay, he would not heare a word of iustifying his dependancy on Spaine, or admission of that enmity toward England, withall applying some instructions worthy so great a Commanders name, intermingled with reprehensions full of authority &amp; eloquence, he admitted him to stand neerer, and (after an houre or more) gaue him leaue to be couered, vsing him with honourable respect, both at his bord &amp; priuate conferences, and so within two daies brought him as a trophe of his victories into Dublin, with a full resolution to carry him into England, and present him to her Maiestie.
            But now is the Sunne of that glory ecclipsed, and the Diuine prouidence thought it meet to take her into his owne

protection. For after she had liued and raigned, to the admiration of all nations, and filled the world with the fame of her vertues foure and forty yeeres, and renowne of life three-score and ten, shee was ordained for a better Kingdome, and the foure and twenty day of March 1602. went to take possession of it. My Lord had notice long before of her decaying, which peraduenture was an incitation the rather for the taking in of Tirone, though he vnderstood not so much. So this great Queene, the Wonder of Time, the Admiration of her Sex, the Help of all Nations, the Princesse of Fame, the Mistrisse of Honour, the Terror of Antechrist, and the Commandrix of Fortune, left her name euerlasting, and dignity vnmatchable. For (beleeue it) what forraine Prince soeuer, more then to admire her, shall striue to imitate her, will but wrong Maiesty, and discouer this imperfection, that emulation is comitant to vertue, and when wee cannot attaine to the transcendency of anothers excellency, wee fall to vilipending the worth, and malicious calumniation of the goodnes: and heerein let England reioyce, that the starre of dignity, and fame of those times, was set vnder her climate by her death, and in her life she treasured such iewels of estimation, that the storehouses of other palaces could not discouer, or shew the like.
            As for Rome, and some defamatory inuentions of Spaine; the poyson hath returned to their owne preiudice, like him which spitting against the winde, found his face besmeered with the reflexion. For, the better sort both misliked Parsons and other English Priests, in their degenerating inuectiues, and stopped the mouths of inferiours, for once breathing amisse against her Maiesty, which makes mee remember a worthy reprehension of Count Mansfield toward Captaine Rowland Yorke, forbidding him some loosnesse of speech against his Queene, and when he transgressed further in vndecencies of fault-finding, both with the gouernment and life of her Maiesty: in plainer termes he assured him, that the customs of his table wold admit of no irregular behauior against Princes: Nor can I forget Duke Byrons admiration, who at

his returne into France, plainely diuulged, that the Court of England spred abroad the coulours of Maiesty indeed, and all others were but a heap of confusion, and diseased mixture of vnseemely familiarity. But this is a digression: for mine own part therefore I will onely blesse her vnimitable renowne, and end with the Poet:

                  O quam te memorem virgo! Nam
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      haud tibi vultus
                  Mortalis! nec vox hominum sonat ô Deo certè.
               
And so to our Irish businesse againe.
            They which write of the nature of things, say plainely (which also experience confirmes) that as there is a sympathy and sweet agreement in many creatures, as beasts, plants, and diuers of that sort: each thriuing the better by the others proximity and conuersation: So there is a kinde of antipathy and eternall loathsomnesse betweene creature and creature, and many times such an abhorrency, that the very sight and intermixture of things breedeth death, or other mischeefe: Thus is it apparant in diuers plants growing neere the Eugh tree, which either perish immediately, or wither by degrees, without any prosperity: they which are skilfull in musique say, that the strings of wolues &amp; sheep make a discord, and will neuer effect either Diapason or harmony. It is recorded, that when Eteocles and Pollinices the sonnes of Oedipus were burned, after they had slaine one another, according to the solemnity of sacrifices in those dayes, the very flame diuided it selfe, shewing that the hate lasted in death, which could not be reconciled in life, and if in any thing it euer appeared, it was and is most probable in the nature and condition of the Irish, and our selues. For though they haue beene many times reduced by conformable perswasion, and as many times corrected by powerfull castigation: yet nothing could detaine them within the circle of obedience, or fasten them to the dore-post of loue and duty: nor was this the errour and enmity of the North, or (as you terme it) the wilde Irish only, but the inficious disposition of the whole Nation, against whom Tirone himselfe, in the behalfe of our countrey, hath gone in person, as in the excursions of Munster, Lease, Ophaly,

Meths and Conach may appeare: yea, at this instant, for all the backe of rebellion seemed broken, and that this great prop of supportation, Tirone, was taken from them, whereby they were past all hope of coadiutement, either from him or Spaine: yet did the poison of their malice and despight burst out into boiles and botches of deformity, by rebellion against the King himselfe, to welcome him the better, euen the first yeere of his establishment in an vncontroulable Maiesty: all which did questionlesse arise from an inueterate hate, and innated antipathy against vs.
            Againe: whereas no venomous beast will liue, nor is bred in Ireland, insomuch that Beda reporteth, that in those dayes, when the Ile of Man bred a controuersie, to which Kingdome it did appertaine, whether England or Ireland, the deciding of the same consisted in this, to carry certain snakes and toades into the Countrey, which if they agreed in the same, and did liue, would easily approoue it English: but if they died and miscarried, then questionlesse, by naturall probability, Ireland had the propriety: wherein the Diuine Prouidence was much glorified, that would not altogether ouer-poyson a nation with noysome creatures and beasts, considering the people were bad enough of themselues, and had their very blouds corrupted with the venome of malice, enuy, disdaine, pride and reuenge, euen against one another; and against vs (if it were possible) the very stones and houses seemed to swell with mislike, and grow bigg againe with the tumors of ambitious rebellion, which more apparantly appeared in the treasons of diuers towns, by name Waterford, Corcke, and Limricke, who vpon the false alarum of Sr. Iames Gouths warrantize from England, for the toleration of religion, went as freshly to masse, as if the Pope himselfe had established his superstitious canons in the same: Nor was this done out of zeale or indirect deuotion, according to the simplicity of diuers, who were willing to maintaine the Catholique cause; but with fury, rage, and military directions, these strong townes entertained a presumption of fortifying themselues against the power of England.
            
            
               Whereupon my Lord Deputy was compelled to leaue Tirone to himselfe, with a kinde of confidence of his loyalty, and politique directions for the superuizing of his actions, and in person went forward to the suppressing these insolencies, vnfolding againe to his great greefe and vnquietnes the woond vp colours of defiances which hee had supposed had beene layd aside for euer: so that whole summer was spent in vnheard of hurliburlies: and his returne into England procrastinated for a time: nor was the busines so soone determined, or the intricatenesse of this disturbance so easily vntied, as many imagined. For Waterford shut the gates, stood vpon their guard, and denied him entrance with his army, vntill exasperated with the displeasure, he read them such a lesson of martiall discipline, that they well vnderstood a patard could blow open their gates, a mine or battery ouerthrow their walls, and such a Commander would not bee dallied withall, when hee determined indeede to whip their treasons with an imperious authority, and so hee proceeded accordingly, pulling this high-looking head of innouation on her knees, depressing the glory of their Maior and gouernment, forfetting their liberties to the State, and establishing Sr. Richard Monson in the full authority of the city, who most iudiciously for the time committed the keyes of the gates to the care and valour of Captaine Meres.
            
            At Corcke they began more roughly, demolishing the new Fort which was a building, turning their ordnance against the castle of Shandon, which they shot through, when my Lady Carey was in it, mustring their townesmen, to the number of two thousand, one or other, with whom they resolued to man their walls and defend their ports, and proceeded with a sauage immanity against diuers, euen to the shedding of bloud, that seemed to intercept, or bee angry with their iollity: and for all they had heard how Waterford was serued, yet they durst say, that Corcke was a stronger towne, better manned, and so well fortified, that they knew my Lord Deputies preparations were not able to surprize them, which hastned his speedinesse, and encreased his anger, so that they found their abused presumption

quickly ouermastred, and besides those, which were slaine in the encounters, my Lord hanged diuers, and arraigned both the Maior and Recorder vpon high treason, setting vpright againe both Shandon and the new Fort, who at either end of the towne ouerlooke the same, and can by this time batter their houses about their eares, if they doe but repine, or whisper against them.
            From hence hee marched to Limricke, but they growing wise by other mens harmes, according to that good councell of Foelix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum, welcommed him that would haue welcommed himselfe, and submitted to such directions, as he enforced against them, not without imprisoning certaine Priests and factious Citizens, whom he detained in prison, as he had done in the other places. From hence he determined to visit Galloway, but vnderstanding of their conformity, hee put it in the accounts of true subiects, and reputed her as a daughter of faire conditions and good behauiour: notwithstanding, he came to Athlone, and wiping away all aspersions of rebellion, as hee went, he left them with fairer faces, then they accustomed to haue: to looke more cheerefully on his Deputy Sr. George Cary the Treasurer at warres, who enioying both places, did proceede iudiciously in the ciuill administration, as little troubled with any remarkable innouation, the rest of the time of his commorance in the Countrey.
            The next yeere our Deputy prepareth for England, as made one of his Maiesties Priuy Councell, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland; and within a while created the Earle of Deuonshire, with some donation of land, and contribution of pensions, to the eternall honour of such a Maiesty, that would not let vertue shed a teare for sorrow, that she was vnrespected; &amp; comfort of all the monarchy, that were the better animated to generous performances, when they saw the Prince would regard them. Thus is Tirone carried into England, as the trophee of his former endeauours and victories. But what a terrible reckoning the accounts of his treasons and vndutifull proceedings summed together, euery man can tell which ouerlooked the

same. For the peoples hate (as hee passed through Wales and other places) was so enflamed against him, that the women presumed to throw durt and stones at him, and the spredding tree which couered him, had much adoe to ouershadow and secure him from the malice and threats of such as railed vpon him: yet with some adoe hath he safe conduct to the Court, and our worthy King looking on him with the eyes of a noble commiseration, quickly welcommed him with cheerefulnesse, and as quickly, by the fauour of Cyrus, returned him; as the Iewes to build vp the walls of broken and desolate Ierusalem: so hee, to reintegrate his estate, repaire his castles and townes, and settle himselfe in his enheritance, as Lieutenant of the Countrey vnder the King, and to gouerne the same after the manner of England.
            
            By this time is Sr. Arthur Chichester Lord Deputy, who watched these parts of the North more narrowly, then any other before him. First, because of his long experience and residence amongst them, as being Gouernor of Knogfergus, and a laborious searcher of Logh Con, with all the territories adiacent. Secondly, in regard of the way open to the flourishes of peace▪ when the Lords of the North saw such a vnity and consent of goodnesse by Tirones remission. Thirdly, in regard of his priuate loue in these parts, to which was vnited a kind of feare &amp; obseruation of his vertue, he had so demeaned himselfe before, &amp; continued euer since. Last of all, by reason of straight directions from England, to haue the Shires diuided with their orderly officers of Lieutenants and Iustices of peace, euen amongst the meere Irish, who neuer heard of such names and gouernment before, to send out Iudges of Assise, whose absolute authority was for the time supereminent aboue all others, and to punish malefactours after our Law and fashion of England, euen to the terrour of the greatest, who vilipended the same, or durst oppose against the inhibition to the contrary: which when Tirone perceiued must be done indeede, hee liued more discontented then euer, and fraighted (as it were) with old stoage of malice and enuy, studied euery houre how to cast off this intolerable yoake of obedience, and

not to suffer (as he termed it) another to sit Paramont in the tribunall of his Iudicatures.
            So that according to our first simile of Cyrus returning the Iewes to Ierusalem, you shall see how he kept correspondency in the same. The Iewes surfeted of ease, forgat their captiuity, &amp; returned to lick vp the filth, that their excesse had vomited; yea, so exasperated the displeasure of their great and good God, that at last hee forsooke them indeede, and stretched the strong armes of Vespasian and Titus, to vnplume their iayes feathers, and throw them forsaken ouer the world like dispersed vagabonds.
            
               Tirone returneth home, as you heard, liueth at ease and pleasure, surfetting of the same, entertaineth his Priests, hearkens to his Bards and Rimers, is seduced to mislike this new gouernment, denieth the Iudges of Assise entrance into his Countrey, contesteth with the Deputy about the same (although he euer acknowledged his worth, and confessed that Sr. Arthur Chichester had vnited many vertues to a Souldiers name) secondeth the Earle of Terconnel in his repinings, and alloweth of Sr. Caher Odohordies contentions, maligning our forwardnesse and successe, when hee saw him lie bleeding on the ground, and verily supposed that the burning of the Dery, with the comming forward of Odonnell to forage the Countrey, would haue made another Gordion to trouble all the Country again to vntie the knot. But, as God would haue it, there is another Alexander to fulfill the prophesie, or Oedipus to dissolue the riddle, who with a sword in his hand can cut it in peeces, so that these new Rebells are discomfited, and such a blast of displeasure is blowne against Dungannon, as the North-east winde, that strucke the foure corners of Iobs eldest sonnes house, and quite ouerthrew it, to the destruction of the people within. For when my Lord Deputy saw no other remedy: but that Tamberlaines blacke flagg must needes be set vp, (the white and the red quite refused) he hasted with fire and sword into the North, and not onely tertified this rebellious Lord with all his Complices, but compelled them to abandon their castles, houses, and inheritances, taking absolute

possession for his new Master the King of Great Brittaine, and incorporated them to the Crowne so firmely and perpetually, that no fine and recouery of their rebellious power should or could disanull the contract, or frustrate the deed: for England presently seased on the same, and like a true Lord and powerfull Commander, placed better tenants, and diuided the Countrey into seuerall mens hands; yea, enfeoffed the City of London with such a right, that I am perswaded all the Irish in the world, or Irish Coadiutors will neuer be able to wrest it out of their hands.
            
               Tirone being thus made the spectacle of misery, by the incitement of certaine Priests, flieth into Terconnell, and contriueth with that Earle to forsake their Countrey, and repaire to Rome, where they might be sure to be shrowded vnder the Angells wings of the Castle St. Angelo, and blessed with the holy fathers entertainment, from the affronts of all disturbance, which accordingly with all conueniency they could, they put in practise, gathering together what treasure the Countrey affoorded, and so with his wife and children, Terconnells wife and young sonne, and some fifty persons or attendants they shipped themselues, and found sufficient friends and meanes to escape.
            Thus like exiles forsaken, dispersed and abandoned, full of horrours of a guilty conscience, vexed in soule by strange excruciations, tormented with feare of being betrayed at home, abashed at the shame of being entertained abroad, and affrighted with the disaster of their lamentable deiection: they are at length compulsed to hide themselues amongst the rotten reedes of Aegypt, euen the Pope and his Consistory of Cardinalls, as in their former determination: where, how his afflictions encreased, and with what vexation of spirit hee eateth the repining bran of other mens corne, that might haue fed on the fine flowre of his owne threshing; I beleeue most trauellers know, but am assured some tremble to behold the alteration: so that for my selfe, well acquainted with all his entertainments

abroad, and misfortunes at home, as knowing him in Ireland, and meeting him in Italy: I may lawfully conclude:

                  Heu cadit in quenquam tantum scelus! tanta iniquitas!
               
            
            FINIS.
