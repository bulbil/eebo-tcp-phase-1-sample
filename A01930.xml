            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               The Prince paſt by and followed one his loue
               His loue, his Siſter, and his vnknowne freind
               The Pagaine curſed all the Gods aboue
               And ſweir he was ſum feirce infernall feind
               And yit in this his raige he followed faſt
               Till of the Prince he got a ſight at laſt.

               Who now hade gote Laiſsa in his armes
               And with myld words hade pacified her fear
               The which to Tropolance bred greatter harmes
               Then when he did his fleſhe and armour tear
               Her looks he thinks vnto his loue conſents
               Wheirby his courage tuentie fold augments.
            
            
               9.
               Now wraith in him began to raige and ſwell
               And thus

               10.
               Then from Phelarnon ſtream'd a luk-warme flood
               With purple goir that dyed the graſſie ground
               Whill as the Pagane ſpy'd the ſtreaming blood
               The victorie he thought he ſurelie found
               But as a Lyone moud to raige and wraith.

               So now the Prince delt deildlie dints and blowes
               That nether armes nor ſheild might them withhold
               Like haill and thundre thouſand ſtroakes he throwes

               From of the graſſe wheiron he ſoftly lay
               And wheir his horſe was feidding their he goes

               His due in fyrie Phlegiton remains,
            
            
               13.
               Then iſhew'd from a deip and hollow Caue
               Tuo Dwarfs that held in eurie hand a torche
               By whoes great light the Prince might weel perceaue

               14.
               The Prince was not amaized at the ſight
               But rather was deſyrous of renoune

               15.
               And beatts with force the Prince his ſheild a back.
               Vpone his face till with that mightie bloe

               Thus being ſenſles layd vpon the ground

               The Gyant wearie of this burthen ſtrong
               Threw him to ground and doun him ſelf he ſett

               And being weel awaked frome his dreame

               All his confufed thoughts bred diſcontents
               And when he ſoght vp from the ground to cleir him
               The gyant with his maſse agane drew neir him.
            
            
               20.
               Which lighted one his ſhoulder with ſuch force

               21.
               The gyant fell with ſuch a fearfull noyes
               As when a thunderbolt from heaune does fall
               Whoes lightning ſeems to rent the azure skyes

               Eune with ſuch noyes the Gyant fell to ground
               While preſentlie the earth did him deuour

               But waiking from this dreaming ſleip at laſt
               His loftie witts agane together flies

               Aboue the toumbe the which he oppin ſeis

               So glaid he was hoping to find releefe
               That ſorow's paſt might haue a happie end
               Wheirfore to eas his cair, his paine, his greif,

               Her words at once bred wounder and delight
               Yet in his hairt ther could no credit fynde
               Till of ſhe tooke her eask of ſylver whyte

               14.
               And euer ſince in loue hade ſhe remaind
               Far hade ſhe gone far ſought to find him out
               Till prouidence of hyer pow'rs ordaind

               Thus whill ſhe gaiſd long on his countenance
               A modeſt ſmyle for anſwer he receau'd
               Oft wold her eyes ſteil furth a ſecreit glance

               From ſecreit pleaſurs and from hid delight
               From gaizing thus at lengthe the Prince awaks her
               To pas away the long and wearie night

               Firſt then ſhe rais'd her myld and modeſt eyes

               My Lord quoth ſhe to ſhow my wofull lyfe

               Which ſhould against mee moſt theire forces bend
               Yet ſhaell yow kno the Muſes crewell hairted
               And what befell to me ſince yow departed.
            
            
               
               19.
               My Parents freinds nor blood I do not kno
               Nor of what houſe or lyne I am diſcendit
               Nor of my wofull birth I can not ſho
               But skairſlie well thrie luſters yit ar endit
               Since ſwadled by the Heliconian fontane
               The Muſes fand me on that pleaſant montane.
            
            
               20.
               They brought me vp within that holy mont
               Taught me their holye reitts and ſacred art
               One day (a wofull day) as I was wount
               When I hade chac'd the Stage ye Hynd ye Harte
               In ther ſwit ſpring to bath I took delight
               Which was my ground of wo greif cair deſpight.
            
            
               21.
               The Muſes for that caus I do not kno
               But that was all the fault they did pretend
               Left me bereft me and decreid my wo
               And by their Pow're deuyne did thither ſend
               Two Knights my loue to win to ſue to pray
               And Riualls both each one did other ſtay.
            
            
               22.
               Then Manſay did his charmes and ſpirits ſend
               Enchaunting them and me as yow haue ſeene
               Which by your might and valour brought to end
               And yow to lett when as he ſaw no meine
               Me in the ſleipping toumbe he did enchaunt
               That ſaw yow knew yow tho my ſpeech did want.
            
            
               
               23
               When from the rook yow took the ſword and ſhield
               Then from my paine and priſone you redem'd me
               I cry'd I cald I ſought you throu the field
               But Manſay that ſome better then eſteem'd me
               Appeird to me and told me you ver gone
               Which made me weet my cheekes and ſigh and mone.
            
            
               24.
               The Wizard then from murning me refrainde
               And told me you ſhould ſaif returne againe
               For you paine cair and ſorow was ordaind
               Whair throw you muſt to glorie great attaine
               So heau'ns decreit and ſo you muſt obay
               Thus ſayd throw ſhaiples aer he went away.
            
            
               25
               His words renewd but ſomwhat eaſd my greif
               Still on I went ouer craigs &amp; montanes hoar
               But hope but hap but help or but releif
               The wraith of heaune, ne're ſatisfiet the more
               And to augment my cair my wo my ſtryfe
               I liued this baſe this poore this ſerueill lyfe
            
            
               26.
               It was my chaunce when I had traueld long
               In forreſts wyde ſome ſheipherds for to find
               Whoes lyfe content ſecure from fortuns wrong
               Would fite my cursd and haitfull dayes to end
               Wheir long I ſerued in poore and mein degrie
               Refuſde no paine whill paine refusde not me
            
            
               
               27.
               But Fortun ſtill invying my estait
               And ſkorning this my bliſt tho poore content
               Disdaning ſo I ſhould eskape her hait
               Not ſuffring death my ſhame wo greif preuent
               Nor pitted ſhe my wo my cair my greif
               But pitied I ſhould thus eſhew miſcheif.
            
            
               28.
               One day as I my ſhaggie flock furth dreane
               From fold to groue to medewe and to plain
               
                  Evandone Prince of Ephyre did perſaue
               Within whoes land thoes ſhipherds all remain
               By chaunce from ſporthe com and me eſteem'd.
               More beautifull then in effect I ſeem'd.
            
            
               29.
               And thither oft in tyms he did reſort
               To thrall me chaſte deſire vnto his will
               But I ſtill cloyde with cairs and vod of ſport
               Denyit his ſute and preiſd to ſhune his ill
               But all in vaine my trauell was for nought
               Me gainſt my will vnto his court he brought.
            
            
               30
               Ane youth he was vnmaried I confes
               And on my head wold ſet his diadem
               But I whoes hairt ane other did poſses
               This ſpak the dame vnwarrs and buſhd for ſhame
               And thus ſhe turnd her ſpeeche, from whom all loue
               
               My cair my greif my ſorrow did remoue.
            
            
               
               31.
               When he perceaud my reſolutione ſtrong
               Vn moud nor vowes, nor prayers could preuaill
               He neids would haue by force diſpight &amp; wrong
               What he could not obtain by louet' aſsaill
               And long he mew'd me vp frome dayes ſweet lyght
               In priſone dark in voes eternall night.
            
            
               32.
               Nor could theſe wrongs his crueltie ſuffeize
               Nor could he pitie puire vnhappie me
               But in the ſight of all the Peoples eyes
               He would bereaue my ſpotles chaſtitie
               Nor could words prayers ſighs or tears him moue
               To leaue ſo foull ſo vyld ſo filthie loue.
            
            
               33.
               His vitious mynd ſo odious had him made
               That all his Lords and people him deteſted
               Then would he haue me bound vpone a bed
               When on my kneis this one thing I requeſted
               He would not ſuffer Raſcalls bind or bow me
               But his owne hands yat honor wold allow me.
            
            
               34.
               Wheirto he yeelds and I reſolue to die
               Then cald I thryce on ſweit Penardos Name
               Thus twyce vnwarrs her paſsion furth did flie
               Twyce ſhe her loue bewrayd &amp; tuyce thought ſhame
               O loue true loue for ſpeeks ſhe or be mute

               35.
               Yet loue to hyde that had ſo oft burſt out
               Her eyes tuixt wraith and ſhame 
                     •
                  old brint and ſhynd
               At laſt this ſhe excuſe ſhe caſts about
               
                  Quod ſhe Thyne ayde would their haue pleaſd my mynd
               I wiſh'd the when the Tyrane did aſpyre
               To act his filthie foull and vyle deſyre.
            
            
               36.
               His dagger then I quicklie puld a paire
               And ere he could him ſelf of me releef
               I ſtobd his loue but with his loue his hart
               Wheir with the people cry'd O ſad miſcheef
               Some in a raige me fouriouſlie aſſayld
               But with the greatter pairt my pairt preuaild.
            
            
               37.
               And thus begane a fearce &amp; crewell feght
               On at her ſyde wer kild hurt bruſd or ſlaine
               I pitied for my caus my deid my right
               They murdred thus ſhould maſacred remane
               Wheirfor with gentle ſpeeche &amp; pleaſant words
               I both appeaſ'd their wraith &amp; ſheathd their ſwords.
            
            
               38
               When they be thought them on the Tyrans deids
