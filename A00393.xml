            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

fyte prayse / that lykewyse as our hole lyfe ought to expresse none other than the spirite Iesus Christ (of whom this daye we do entende to speake) so lykewyse this our sermon maye sauer on hym / represent hym / breath hym / whiche is both the worde of the father and hath all onely the wordes of lyfe / whose lyuely and workynge speche is more percyng then any .ii. edged swerd percynge to the very inwarde chaumbers of the herte.

                   thirsting. That is to say such eares as that eternall worde requyrynge in the gospell of sayntte Matthew the. xi. Chapitre saythe. Qui habit aures ad audiendum audiat / that is to saye
               
                  ☞ Who hath cares to the entente to heare / let hym heare. But as touching me / why may I not be bold to en terpryse this thynge harde I wyll not denye / but yet godly / namely god hym selfe beynge my ayder and helper / in whome the lesse mans infirmyte trusteth in his owne powers the more able it shalbe / and in whome Paule bosteth that he can do all thynges. Moreouer syth these persons do 
                     〈◊〉
                    with such feruent 
                     〈◊〉
                    and affection whiche haue wedded and appoynted themselues to the warfare of this worlde / that is to saye / of the deuyll that eche one of them shulde extolle / auaunce / and magnifie theyr captayne with all the 
                     〈◊〉
                    of prayse that can be ymagyned / howe muche better and soner ought we to magnifie euen auye who can do best with deuout hymnys and commindations our mayster / redemer / &amp; captayne Iesus / and the same also the prynce of all in generall / but of vs chyldren in especial? Him fyrst &amp; principaly to know let vs studie / knowen let vs prayse / praysed let vs loue / loued let vs expresse expressed let vs counterfet / counterfettynge

lette vs enioye / enioynge let vs take immortal felicite. But in so plentyfull &amp; so vnmeasurable copye of thyn ges from whens shal we take a begynnyng of our sermon / or where shall we fynde an ende? Syth he of whome we entēde to entreate is the very foūtayne or (to speake more truely) the occean see of all goodnes and good thynges. But as he hymselfe of nature incomprehensible and infinyte / yet was contented to compasse and dryue his owne selfe (as who saythe) into a streyght. So lykewyse our sermon in expoundynge his prayses which be of themselfes vnmeasurable / must of necessyte put a measure to it selfe. Ueryly I see that there be thre thynges principally whiche be wont to kyndle and enflame the hertes eyther of scolers or of souldyours to do valiauntly and manly / the fyrste is to be brought in to an admira / cyon of theyr guyde or captayne! the secounde to loue hym / the thyrd the rewarde. wherfore to thentent we myght with more feruent and cherefull courages obey our master and captayne Iesus / go we to. Let vs consyder seuerally

al these thre thynges with a deuout curiosite in hym. Fyrste of all howe wonderfull he is on euery syde and to be astoyned at. After that howe greatly he is to be loued and for that cause also to be folowed. And last of all what hyghe profyte / frute / and auauntage shall arryse vnto vs by this loue. Howe / it is the vsage of Khetoriciās in this kynd of oration to shewe ensamples of noble prynces / to this purpose and entēt that by the comparyson of hym whom they prayse with other / his nobles and vertues myght appere the greater. But our captayne so greatly and wonderfully surmounteth all the heyth of humane dignite / and hyghnes that whō soeuer a mā sheweth be he neuer so wor thy excellent and hygh / yet he shal seme to adde darkenes and not lyght. For whose progenye and noblenes shall not seme smoke if thou cōpareste hym with Iesus whiche by an vnspeakable / nay with an vnthynkable reason is borne god of god alwaye without tyme egall in all thynges to his eternall and most hyghe parent. Howe be it though we go no further than to his humane natiuitie / 

I pray you do it not easyly enshadowe and obscure the clearnes of al other kynges &amp; prynces in the worlde? as he whiche wonderfully aboue the course of nature / his father of heuen beyng the worker and authour / the holy ghoste breathyng / the aungel beyng the massanger / without mans industrie was borne a virgyne / of a virgyne beynge pregnant and with chylde by the handworke of the heuenly father / and was borne a man / and in tyme. And agayne was so borne a man that nother be lefte to be god / nor yet he drew none of our fylthynes vnto hym at all. Now syr what can be ymagyned more ample than he whiche beynge infounded through all / yet restreyned in no place abydeth in hymselfe vncompassable &amp; vnmcasurable? what is more ryche than he which is the very chyef &amp; principall goodnes / from whome all good thynges do issue / and yet he is not therby dyminyshed? what is more renoumed than he whiche is the renoume of his fathers glorie / and whiche onely lyghtneth euery man commynge into this worlde? what is more myghty

than he to whome the father almyghty hath gyuen all power in heuen and in earthe? what is of more force than he whiche with a symple becke made all / at whose commaundement the see falleth / the shappes of thynges be turned / the dyseases flee / the armed fall downe / the deayls are dryuen awaye / the elementes they / the rockes of stone are cutte in sonder / the dead waxe a lyue agayne / the synners be conuerted / fynally all thynges be made new? who is of wyder imperye then he / whiche they in heuen magnifie / they in 
                     〈◊〉
                    tremble at / this mydde worlde humbly worshyppeth / to the comparyson of whome / the moste haut and hygh kynges confesse themselues to be but wretched wormes? what is stronger and more victorious than he whiche alone / death whiche was to all other 
                     〈◊〉
                    ouercam with his owne death / and whiche layd downe and abated the tyrannye of Satan by his heuenly prowes and vertue?
               What is more triumphaunt than he whiche breakynge and spoylynge helle accompaynyed with so manye godly

soules lyke a valiant conquerour ascended vp to heuen and there sytteth at the ryght syde of his father? What is wyser than he which with so wonderfull reason created al thynges that euen in the very lytle bees he hath lefte so many &amp; so greate miracles of his wysdom? and which with so wonderful ordre of thynges and harmonye knytteth / conteyneth / admynistreth all whiche goyth rounde about all and yet departeth not from hymselfe mouyng all / beyng hym selfe vnmoued / shakyng all / hymselfe quyet / fynally yt which is most folyshe in hym / passeth by longe dystaunce the hole wysdom of the wyse men of the world / whose authorite ought so much the more be the greatter vnto vs / that the father hymselfe openly wytnesseth of hym saynge / ☞ here is my welbeloued sonne in whome is my pleasaunce / harken to hym. What is so reuerend as he to whose eyes all thynges be open? What is so to be drad as he which with his only becke can sende both soule and bodye into hell. What is more beautyfull than he whose countenaunce to beholde is the hygh ioy? Fynally if many thynges be had precious for the antiquitie?

what is more auncient than he which neyther had begynnyng nor shal haue endyng? But it were perchaunce more conuenient that chyldern shulde wonder at the chyld / for here also he ap pereth wonderfull in so much that the lowest of hym is more hygh than those thynges which be moste hygh in men. Howe great was he whom beyng but a babe cryeng wrapped in cloutes caste lyke an abiecte thyng in the crybbe / yet the aungels from heuen magnifie with theyr songe / the shephardes worshyp / yea she that bare hym worshyppeth / the brute beastes acknowledge / the sterre sheweth / the wyse astronomers

If we marueyle at greate thynges / what can be by all maner of meanes more ample than our Iesus whome no creature can outher expresse with the voyce / or conceyue

               ¶ The secounde part.
               BUt the deuyls do wonder &amp; also tremble at hym / onely good men loueth hym / wherfore the other parte of this sermon as it goeth more nyghe vnto vs / so it is to be herde with more

attentyfe cares that is to wyte for how many causes Iesus is to beloued of vs / nay to be reloued rather / for he loued vs not yet created before all tyme in hym felfe in whom euen than were all thynges. And therfore by his natyue goodnes whan we were nought / he formed vs / and he formed vs / not any maner beste / but man / and he formed to his owne lykenes / that is to wyse / receyua ble of the hyghe ioy and with the holy breath of his mouth he dyd put into vs the breath of lyfe. Besyde this all other beastes and fowles commaunded to be obedyent at our cōmaundement / more ouer the aungels appoynted out to pro tecte and defende vs / he assygned and gaue all this moste wyde and goodly buyldyng of the worlde to our vses and behoues / in whiche he hath set vs in a certayne wonderfull stage to the

                    that in the thynges created we myght wonder vpon the wysdom of the makee loue the goodnes / haue in reuerence and veneration the power / and that we myght the more do thus / be hathe furnyshed vs with so many helpes of senses / and hath garnyshed vs with

so many good qualities of mynde and hath decked vs with so bryght &amp; quycke lyght of wytte. what can be ymagyned outher / more wonderfull / or happyer / than this creature? But oh cursed enuye alway the compaygnion of welth / agayne by the subtyltie of the serpent he fell wretchedly into synne that is to wyte into worse thā naught. But here agayue thou oh good Jesu with what vnspecable

                   ? with how holsom preceptes doyst thou nourture and forme vs? with how won derfull miracles doyste thou awaken vs? with howe fayre monitions doyste thou drawe vs? with how sure promisses doyst thou muyte? so that there is none more cōmodious way to the than by thy owne selfe whiche onely art the waye / the trouth / &amp; lyfe. But thou hast

not onely shewd the way / but also thou haūe opened it whyle thou woldest for vs be bounde / drawē / damned / skorned / whypped / bespytted / be bete / be reuyled and at laste also vpon the rode of the crosse / lyke a lambe without spotte be offcred / that by thy bondes thou myghtest loseu vs / by thy woundes heale vs / with thy bloud wesh vs / with thy death brynge vs to immortalite. Brefly thou bestowedst thyselfe holly vpon vs / that by the losse of the (if it were possyble) thou myght saue vs whiche were lost / when thou wert restored agayne to lyfe thou apearedst so often to thy disciples / and in theyr syght dydest stye vp to heuen that they myght trust to com thythee wher they sawe theyr hede to haue gone before them. This done to the entent thou myghtest yet more conferme thy frendes / thy father pacified / thou dydest sende that noble pledge of thy perpctuall loue / the holy ghoste / that dead to the worlde we myght lyue now in the farre more truely and blessedly than we lyueby this our owne spirite. I beseche you / what can be added to these proues of hygh charite. Nor these

Nisi conuersi fueritis &amp; efficiamini sicut paruulus iste, non intrabitis in regnū coelorum. Oneles ye be cōuerted and be made as this babe is / ye shall not entre into the kyngdom of heuen. Hytherto also belongeth that whan Nicodemus demaūded of Christe by what waye he myght

come to euerlastyng blysse / he demaunded hym to be borne agayne / that is to wyte / to come agayne into a chylde. Lo so greatly infauncy pleaseth Christ our captayne / yt he enforceth also the aged men to waxe chyldren agayne / if they wyll be receyued into his compaygnye besyde whome there is no hope of saluation.

And let vs also remembre this thynge / that this chyldhode so greatly and so derely beloued of Christe lyeth not in yeres / but in myndes / it consysteth not in tymes but in maners.

wherfore there is also a certayne newe hynde of chyldehode whiche is alowed of Christ a chyldhode without chyldysshenes / and generally to speake) a certayne aged chyldehode / which standeth not in the noumbre of yeres but in innocentie and simplycitye of wytte / doth not Peter openly shewe the same when he sayth.

and purenesse / and not by theyr byrth. And in lyke wyse S. Paule also sayth. Malicia paruuli estote, sensibus aūt perfecti. In malice (q he) be babes / but in wytte be ye perfecte / howe be it there is vntuersally in the very age of chyldrē a certayne natyue &amp; naturall goodnes / and as it were a certayne shadowe &amp; ymage of innocencye or a hope rather and dyspositton of a goodnes to come. A softe mynde and plyable to euery behauour / shamefastnes which is a good kepar of innocencit / a wytte voyde of vyces / bryghtnes of bodye / and as it were a flower of a floryshyng worlde / and (I can not tell how) a certayne thyng alye and familiare to spirites. For it is not for naught that as ofte as the aungels appeare with thy shewe themselfes in chylderits lykenes / yea moreouer they that vse art magicke whan so euer they fetch vp spirites with theyr enchaunte mteēs (as men say) they be called vp in sykenesse of a bodely chylde / but howe muche more gladly wyll that heuenly spirite called vpon with deuout and ho ly vowes enter into suche mansions? wherfore to these gyftes of nature if

imitation of that hyghe and absolute chylde be caste vnto / then fynally shall chyldrē seme louyng &amp; kynde towardes hym &amp; also worthy &amp; fytte for hym / for the

Truely the spirite of Iesu generally abborteth and hateth all fylthynes but specyally that beastly luste and vtterly vnworthy for man. what taught he vs in that he was borne frōm home in another countre / delyuered of his mother in a vyle cotage / cast downe in a cribbe / wrapped aboute with vyle cloutes? but that we shulde always remembre that we be here straungers for a fewe dayes / and that all ryches troden vnder fete and the false honours of the worlde despyfeth we shulde haste vs beynge as lyght and lose as maye be to our heuenly countre through vertuose labours / in which our heuenly and natyue countre we ought alredy to lyue in mynde although we touche as per the erthe with our corporall fete. Agayne what monyshed he vs in that he fledde into Egypt / but that by all meanes we shulde eschue to entermedle with contagious people whiche labour to put out Christ in vs (that is to wyte) innocencye / and the despysyng of the world?

Nowe consyder ye with our selues (oh chyldren) with howe holy studyes and occupacyons that same chylde so borne so offered vp to god dyd passe our his chyldhode. Not with ydelnes / not with eatynge and drynkyng / not with slepe / not with vayne sportes and playes / not with fowlyshe fables / not with straynges abrode / as the common sort of chyl dren are wont to do / but outher with minystryng and seruyug his parentes / 

or with holy prayers / or hearynge the preachers and teachers / or with deuout meditations or with holy and arnest communications with other chyldren / hath not saynte Luke in his gospell comprysed brefly all these and many other lyke / when he wryteth in this maner. Puer crescebat &amp; confortabatur plenus sapientia, &amp; gratia dei erat millo. That is to say. The chylde grewe and wexed stronge / full of wysdom / and the grace of god was in hym. Do ye not manifestly see a newe kynde of chyldehode. Of the chyldren in tymes paste it was sayd. Stulticia colligata est in corde pueri. That is to saye. Foly is teyed to gether in a chyldes herte. Of the newe chylde ye here. Plenus sapientia full of wysdom / why do we any longer excuse our rudenes vnder the clock of our tender age / when we heare a chyld not one ly wyse but full of wysdom?

He whan all is done is the wyse man and hathe the ryghte knowledge / whiche to the worlde is but a fole / and whiche sauereth nothynge but Christe. He is knowen not by the bokes of the phylosophers / nor yet by subtyll and sophistycall argumentes / but by pure faythe he is knowen / by hope he is holden / by charitie he is wonne.

Harken ye chyldren where the chylde Iesus was founde / leuyng his frendes and in maner a fugityue &amp; a renaway / and ye shall casyly vnderstande where ye ought to be consernaunt. In the tem ple (I saye) he was founde syttynge in the myddes of the doctours hearynge theyr reasons / and demaundynge questiōs of them. What hath Iesus taught vs by these so wonderfull deades? No doubt but that he hath taught vs some great thynge / som earneste matter / and to be hyghly folowed / &amp; what is that? Surely that whyle Christ ware bygge in vs (for he is also borne in vs / &amp; hath his degrees of ages / vntyl he growe vp to a stronge and perfet man / and into the measure of his fulnes) wherfore whyle (I say) he ware bygge in vs / he teacheth vs to transferre and shyft our naturall affections whiche be towarde our parentes and other frendes vpon god / nothyng to loue here / nothyng to

magnifie but in Christe &amp; Christ in all / let vs remembre that we haue our true father / countre / kynsfolke and frendes in heuen. But left a man wold ymagyn with this neglectyng of parentes shuld sauer any pryde or disobediencie / it foloweth. Et erat subditus illis. And he was subiet vnto them / nay rather none more truely loueth his parentes / none more naturally honoreth them / none obeyeth them more obsequiosly / than he which thus cōtemueth them. What is it to sytte in the temple / but to rest in holy thynges / and to brynge a mynde to learne / quyet from al worldly cares? Nothynge is more turbulent than vyces / and agayne wysdom loueth 
                     〈◊〉
                    and quyetnes. Now / of what any person shall we disdayne to lerne / howe attentyte cares ought we to gyue to our maysters / whan that heuenly chyld Ie sus the wysdom of god his father / sytteth in myddes of the doctours / hearyng and agayne demaundyng of them and aunswerynge / but so aunswerynge that all wondered on his wysdom? Nor no wonder syth he was suche one / to whome all the wysdom of the world is

folyshe. The knowledge of lawes is a goodly thyng / the setēce of philosophie is a noble thyng / the profession of divinitte is a thynge hyghly to be magnified. But who heareth Iesus / forthwith all thynge ware folyshe / but our aunswer though it can not styre a myracle of wysdom at lest way let it sauer of sovernes and discretion / let it sauer innocencie. Agayn I beseche you how obeysaujit / how seruyable becommeth it vs to be to our parentes &amp; maysters (whome we ought to preferre as they whiche be the parentes of the wytte) syth that lorde of all / at what tyme he was of that depe wysdom that his parentes vnderstode hym not / yet he retur ned with them to Nazareth submyttyng hymselfe vnto them. we owe this to the naturall loue / we owe this to the reuerence towarde our parentes / that otherwhyles we gyue place to theyr wyl though we see better what is to be done than they. But now it is good to see with howe mete an ende Luke hath concluded the chyldehode of Iesus.

of any one. So lykewyse we the more we be in Christ / the lesse we shal please our selues if so be that we profyt in him truely / so that always the standyng in a maus owne conceyt is the very pestilence and veter destruction both of studies and also of goodnes. And after 
                     〈◊〉
                   /the ouer rype kynde of wyt tes cōmeth not lyghtly to thryste neyther of leruyng nor goodnes / I thynke that the order also is not in vayne apud deum, &amp; apud homines with god &amp; with men. So that we ought to vnderstand that cheyfly &amp; fyrst of all we muste apply vs that our lyf may please god / and if we do so / the fauour of mā shall folow alone. For nothyng is more fayer than vertue / nothynge more amiable / after whome prayse is accustomed the more to folowe / the lesse that it be coueted. With as fewe wordes as we myght we haue expressed vnto you (chyldren) an exampler &amp; president of a chylde / whom we ought both to loue most / and folow most effectually. And surely so muche shall we seme to loue / as we shall folow hym. Agayne howe much the more 
                     〈◊〉
                    we shall loue hym / so muche the

fuller we shall folowe hym. Wherfore let vs require this one thynge of hym with dayly &amp; pure prayers / that he wyl graūt vs to brenne in his loue / to proue lyke vnto hym / that is / chaste / pure / vn spotted / mylde / symple / easy to be entreated / voyde of craft / ignorāt of gyle / knowynge not what enuye meaneth / obeysant to the parentes / obsequious to the comaundemēt of our maysters despysers of the world / auowed to holy thynges / attent and wedded to godly letters / passynge our selues dayly in goodnes / allowed of god / well accepted among men / and by the sauour &amp; smelle of our good name alluryng very many to Christ. These thynges (I say) continually let vs requyre / these let vs attempt both with handes &amp; fete / whyle our age serue vs whiche wyll els flee shortly away / for if Duintilian monyssheth a ryght saynge. Optima statim ac primo discenda. 1. The beste thynges are by and by and fyrste to be learned / I praye you / what ought to be learned soner than Christ / whiche is beste of all thynges / nay rather what other thyng ought a christian man to learne than

hym / whome to knowe is 
                     〈◊〉
                    lyfe as hymselfe wytnesseth prayuge his father in the gospell / which thynge if we do / we shall as it were for our power yelde thankes and acquyte his kyndnes and singular goodnes toward vs / &amp; in thus acquyryng hym / we shall wynne hym vnto vs. And the more fully we shall acquyte / howe much the more 
                     〈◊〉
                    we shall reloue hym. So much the more we shal reloue hym howe muche the more we expresse hym in lyfe and manners. And the more we expresse hym / so much the more we shal be enryched in hym.
            
            
               ¶ The thyrde parte.
               But in the meane whyle some per chaunce wyll thynke that this is an hard warfare to cast vp all and take the crosse with Christ / but let vs remē
                  bre (most dere brethern) that the nature of the worlde and of Christ is farre con trarye and dyuerse. The worlde as it were a paynted harlat at ye fyrst syght sheweth it selfe vnto vs amyable / and (as it were) golden. But after / the deper

ye entre in / and the more narre ye loke in / so muche the more and more / fowle stynkyng &amp; bytter be all together Cōtrary wyse Christ / to thē yt behold hym a farre of / he semeth sō what hard whyle we see crosses and the despysyng of pleasurs and of lyfe. But who that with a trusty &amp; bolde hert casteth hymselfe holly vpon hym / he shal fynde nothyng softer / nothynge more at large / nothynge sweter. Oneles perchaunce he hymselfe beyng the very trouth speketh not the trouth in the gospel where he sayth. Colligite iugum meum super vos, &amp; inuenietis requiem animabus vestris. iugum enim meum suaue est, &amp; onus meum leue. Take my yocke vpon you (sayth Christ) and ye shall fynde reste to your hertes / my yocke is swete / and my burden is lyte. This vndoubtedly is the very harde way of vertue which in olde tyme longe before Christes commyng Hesiodus in maner dremed on / at the fyrst enteryng in and cōmyng to / sumwhat roughe and harde / but after one be a whyle entered / it is alwaye more and more easy and pleasaunt. But admitte it to be a very sharpe waye of

it selfe / I praye you howe can it seme sharpe syth by it we go ye way to so cer tayne &amp; so greate a rewarde. If accordynge to the saynge of the wyse man. Spes premii minuit vim flagelli. The hope of the reward doth minyshe the violēce of the skorge / who in this transitorie lyfe wolde not iudge it lyte and swett / wherby he getteth that heuenly lyfe / &amp; which shal neuer for sake him to raygne eternally with Christ / to behold continually that hygh ioy &amp; goodnes / to be conuersaunt in the cōpanye of aungels to be farre from all feare of cuyls? who I praye you this so greate a rewarde wolde not gladly bye yea with a thousand deathes? and this so greate a stypend doth Iesus our captayne promise to his souldyers / whiche wyll not lye / nor can not deceyue. Now ponder with your selues the frutes / the eternite / and the magnitude and greatues therof / agaynste whiche set the shorte tyme of this warfare whiche is no longer than ye very 
                     〈◊〉
                    which lyf what is it els thā a vapor aperynge for a lytle tyme / or a slepe of one houre. But we go to / of this mestunable rewarde let vs a whyle be

styll / &amp; let vs now see with howe abundantly greate rewardes our guyde and captayne recompenseth the labours of his souldyers also in this lyfe / &amp; howe an onlyke haruest they repe whiche be souldyers of the world / and they which fyght vnder Christ Jesu. Let vs here what ye wycked men themselfes say in the boke of sapiētie. Lassati sumus in via iniquitatis &amp; perditiōis, ambul auimus vias difficiles, viam autem domini ignorauimus. That is to say. we be wery in the way of 
                     〈◊〉
                   /and of perdition / we haue walked harde ways / but the way of the lorde we haue not knowen. The world entyseth vs with his cloked &amp; coūterfet shadows of goodes / which be nothyng els but poysons couered with honye / and by &amp; by when we be ones plucked out of them &amp; as it were put out of seruyce &amp; forsaken / lord god / into what cares / what thoughtes / what troubles / what losses / what disworshypes / into what vexation of the conscience of the mynde / into what wretched ende doth it bring the vnhappy persons? So that they myght seme to haue suffered penaunce ynough for theyr wyckednes / 

though no hell shulde cusewe. But he whiche all the deceytes of the worlde reiected / fireth his hole loue / care / and studie / vpon Iesus / that is / the hyghe good thynge / and hang holly on hym / he accordyng to the promise of the gospcll shal not oncly possesse eternal lyfe / but also shall receyuc in this worlde an hundreth tymes folde so muchc. And what is it to receyue an hūdreth tymes so muche? Ueryly for forged and counterfelled goodes / true / for vncertayne certayuc / for transitorie crernal / for 
                     〈◊〉
                    pure / for cares quyetnes / for vexation of mynde truste &amp; confidence / for troublesomnes tranquillitte / for losses profyte / for lewdnes goodnes / for the torment of consciēce secrete and incffable ioy / for a fowle &amp; miserable ende a glorious and triumphant deathe.
               Thou haste dcspysed ryches for Christcs louc / iii hym thou shalt fynde true tresures. Thou haste reiected false honours / so muche in hym thou shalt be the more honorable. Thou hast neglec ted the affections of thy parentes / so muche the more tenderly wyll the true father cheryshe the / which is in heuēs.

Thou haste set at nought the wysdom of the world / in Christ thou shalt much more truely be wyse / and more happyly. Thou hast despysed pestiferous plea surs / in hym shalt thou fynd facre other deynties. Brefly to speake when thou seyst ones tho secrete / and true ryches of Christ / the mysty clowde of the world dryuen in sonder / then all thyuges whiche here tofore semed pleasaunte / whiche 
                     〈◊〉
                    sollicite the / thou shalt not only not magnific &amp; haue them in admi ratiō / but a certayn pestilēt destructiōs &amp; poysons thou shalt

                     〈◊〉
                   / cast of. For it chaunseth wonderfully that so sone as that heuenly lyghte toucheth throughly our myndes / sodenly a certayne newe face of all thynges spryngeth forthe / so that it whiche a lytle to fore semed dulcet / nowe waxeth tart / whiche sower / waxeth swete / whiche semed vnfarynge waxethe amyable / whiche semed amyable waxeth vnfarynge / whiche tofore gorgyous nowe fylthy / whiche myghty / weake / which beautyfull defourme / whiche noble vnnoble / whiche ryche nedy / whiche hygh lowe / whiche gaynes dammage / 

which wyse folyshe / whiche lyfe death / which to be desyred to be fledde / and cō
                  trary wyse. So that sodenly the face of thynges chaunged thou wolt iuge it to be nothyng lesse than that which it semed before / wherefore in Christ all good thynges be founde compendiously and truely of which the vayne and counter fet ymages and shadows / &amp; as it were ioglynge castes / this worlde sheweth / whiche the wretched cōmon sort of peo ple pursueth and seketh with so greate trouble of mynde / with so great losses / with so great daungers / by ryght and wronge. I beseche you what blysse can ye compare with this mynde which is nowe free from errour / free from affections / without care / always ioynge for the testimonie of conscience / vexed with nothynge / haut / hygh / and next to heuen and nowe aboue the lot of man / which in Christ the most hygh pyllar &amp; rocke / beynge borne &amp; steyed by / all the falsities of this worlde / the troubles / frayes / &amp; stormes depely laugheth at / disuyseth / or rather reweth. For what shulde he feare which hath god his protectour? shulde he feare reproche? Nay

it is an hyghe glorie to suffer reproche for Christ. 
                     〈◊〉
                    nay the burdayn of ryches he gladly casteth awaye who so hastcth hym to Christ. Death? nay / for that he most wysheth / wherby he is assured to be set ouer to immortall lyfe. For what thyng shuld he take thought whose father in heuē hath not so much but his heares numbred &amp; told? &amp; what shulde he couet which in Christ possesseth al thynges? For what is not common to the membres and to the hede? Now how great is mans not onely felicitie / but also dignitie to be a lyuyshe mēbre of the most holy body the church to be al one with Christ / the same fleshe the same spirite / to haue all one father with hym / in heuens / to haue Christe our brother / to be destinate with hym to the same enherytauncc. And (shortly to conclude) to be no longer a man but a god? Put hereunto / a certayne taste of the felicitie that is to com / which the good &amp; vertuous mynd do perceyue and enioy euer among. This vndoubtedly saw / this felt ye prophete whā he saith. Nec auris audiuit, nec oculus vidit, nec in

                    that we may be be truely the membres of Christ / accordynge to the saynge of the prophete. Iustus vt palma storebit / the ryghtwyseman shal flower lyke the palme tre / yea also in this lyfe we shall spryng and flory she with a certayne perpetual youth / not onely in mynde but also in bodye. For lyke as that flowryng spirite of Ie su shall redounde into our

                    / so agayne ours shall slowe into his bodye / and so much as may / it shalbe transfor med into it. Nor this so greate beauty both of body and mynde can not beare the fylthyncs of garmente. For our mynde is the habitation of god / the body is the
