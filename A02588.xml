            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               RIGHT HONOVRABLE,
            
            
               WHiles I deſired to congratulate your happy Returne with ſome worthy preſent; I fel vpon this: which I dare not only offer, but commend; the royalleſt Philoſopher and wiſeſt king, giuing you thoſe precepts, which the Spirit of God gaue him. The matter is all his;

nothing is mine, but the methode; which I doe willingly ſubmit to cenſure. In that he could not erre: In this, I cannot but haue erred; either in art, or application, or ſenſe, or diſorder, or defect: yet not wilfully. I haue meant it well, and faithfully to the Church of God, &amp; to your Honor, as one of her great hopes. If any man ſhall cauill that I haue gone about to correct Salomons order, or to controule Ezekias ſeruants: I complaine both of his charity, and wiſdom; and appeale more lawefull iudgement: Let him aſwell ſay, that euery Concordance peruerts the Text. I haue only endeuoured to be the common-place-booke of that great king, and to referre his diuine rules to their heads, for more eaſe of finding, for better memory, for readier vſe. See, how that God, whoſe wiſdom thought good to bereaue mankinde of Salomons profounde commentaries of Nature, hath reſerued theſe his diuine Morals, to out-liue the world; as knowing,

that thoſe would but feed mans curioſitie, theſe would both direct his life, and iudge it. Hee hath not done this without expectation of our good, and glory to himſelfe: which if wee anſwere, the gaine is ours. I know how little need there is, either to intreat your Lo: acceptation, or to aduiſe your vſe. It is enough to haue humbly preſented them to your hands; and through them to the Church: the deſire of whoſe good, is my good; yea, my recompence and glory. The ſame God, whoſe hand hath led and returned you in ſafetie, from all forraine euils: guide your wayes at home, &amp; gratiouſly increaſe you in the ground of all true honor; Goodneſſe. My praiers ſhall euer follow you:
            
               
                  VVho vow my ſelfe Your Honours, in all humble and true duetie, Ioſ. Hall.

The ſatietie of the rich will not ſuffer him to ſleepe;Ec. 5.12. ſo there is an euill ſickeneſſe, which I haue ſeene vnder the Sunne, riches reſerued to the owners thereof, for their euill, and ofter, not for their good:Ec. 6.1. for there is another euill, which I haue ſeene vnder the Sunne, and it is frequent among men;Ec. 6.2. A man to whome God hath giuen riches and treaſures, and honour, and he wanteth nothing for his ſoule, of all it deſireth; but God giueth him not power to eate thereof; and if hee haue that, yet how long? Riches remaine not alwayes,Pr. 27.24. but taketh her to her wings as an Eagle,Pr. 23.5. and flyeth to the heauens. And for their owner,
                        Ec. 5.14. As he came

forth of his mothers belly, hee ſhall returne naked, to goe as he came, and ſhall beare away nothing of his labour, which hee cauſed to paſs by his hand: And this is alſo an euill ſickneſſe,Ec. 5.15. that in all points as hee came, ſo ſhall he goe: and what profit hath he, that hee hath trauelled for the winde?

had liued a thouſand years twiſe tolde, and had ſeene no good;Ec. 6.6 ſhall not all goe to one place? and howſoeuer, the light ſurely is a pleaſant thing, and it is good for the eyes to ſee the ſunne;Ec. 11.7. yet tho a man liue many yeares, and in them all he reioice;Ec. 11.8. if he ſhall remember the dayes of darkeneſſe, becauſe they are manie, all that commeth is Vanitie.

                        Ec. 1.13. I haue giuen my heart to ſearch and find out wiſdome, in all things that are done

vnder the heauen, (this ſore trauaile hath God giuē to the ſons of men to humble them therby) yea,
                        Ec. 1.16. I thought in my heart and ſayd, Beholde I haue amplified and increaſed wiſedome, aboue all them that haue beene before mee, in the Court and Vniuerſitie of Ieruſalem,Ec. 2.9. and mine heart hath ſeene much wiſedome and knowledge: for (when J was at the wildeſt) my wiſedome remained with mee:Ec. 2.13 Then I ſawe, inindeede, that there is profit in wiſedome more then in folly; as the light is more excellent then darkeneſſe;Ec. 2.14. For the wiſemans eyes are in his head, but the foole walketh in darkeneſſe: but yet, I knowe that the ſame

condition falleth to them all: Then I thought in mine heart;Ec. 2.15. It befalleth to mee as it befalleth to the foole; why therefore doe I labour to be more wiſe? For,Ec. 6.8. what hath the Wiſe-man more then the foole? There ſhall bee no remembraunce of the wiſe,Ec. 2.16. nor of the foole for euer: for that that now is, in the dayes to come ſhall bee forgotten; and how dieth the Wiſe-man? as dooth the foole: Beſides the imperfection of the beſt knowledge;Ec. 1.8. for the eye is not ſatisfide with ſeeing, nor the eare filled with hearing: I thought I wil be wiſe:Ec. 7.25. but it went farre from mee; it is farre off▪ what may it bee? and it is a profound deepeneſs,

who can find it? yea, ſo farre is it from giuing contentment, that in the multitude of wiſdō is much griefe,Ec. 1.18. and hee that increaſeth knowledge, increaſeth ſorrowe.
                     
                        Laſtly, not in any humane thing: for I haue conſidered all the workes that are done vnder the ſunne;Ec. 1.14. and behold, all is vanity &amp; vexation of ſpirit.

The fruites of it are ſingular: for, firſt, A wiſe heart doth not only ſeeke, but get knowledge,Pr. 15.14. without which the minde is not good;Pr. 18.15. &amp; the eare of the wiſe, learning;Pr. 19.2 
                        and not get it onely but lay it vp,Pr. 10.14. Pr. 13.16. 
                        and not ſo onely but workes by it; and yet more, is crowned with it.Pr. 14.18. 
                        Beſides knowledge, heere is ſafety.
                        Pr. 2.10. When wiſdome entreth into thy heart, and knowledge delighteth thy ſoule, then ſhall counſell preſerue thee,Pr. 2.11. and vnderſtanding ſhall keep thee:Pr. 2.12. and deliuer thee from the euil way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things,Pr. 2.13. and from them that

leaue the wayes of righteouſneſſe, to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe: and as from ſinne, ſo from iudgement.
                        Pr. 15.24. The way of life is on hy to the Prudent, to avoid from hell beneath. Thirdly, good direction.
                        Pr. 8.20. 1. For actions; Wiſdom cauſeth to walke in the waie of righteouſnes, and in the mids of the paths of iudgement: 2. For words,
                        Pr. 16.23. The hart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lips; So that the words of the mouth of a wiſe man haue grace:Pr. 10.12. 
                        yea, he receiues grace from others. Either Inſtruct, or reprooue the Prudent,Pr. 19.25 and he wil vnderſtand knowledge. Not to ſpeake of wealth;Pr. 8.21. ſhee cauſeth them that loue hir to inherit ſubſtance,

and filleth their treaſures: ſhe giueth not onely honor: for the wiſdome of a man doth make his face to ſhine,Ecc. 8.11. Pr. 3.35 
                        &amp; the wiſeman ſhal inherit glory; but life:Pr. 16.22 Vnderſtanding is a wel-ſpring of life to him that hath it; and he that findeth me (ſayth wiſdome) findeth life,Pr. 8.34 and ſhall obtaine fauour of the Lord. Wherfore Get wiſdom;Pr. 4.5. get vnderſtanding; forget not, neither decline from the words of my mouth. Forſake her not,Pr. 4.6. and ſhe ſhall keep thee; loue her, &amp; ſhe ſhall preſerue thee. Wiſdom is the beginning;Pr. 4.7. get wiſedome therfore, &amp; aboue all poſſeſſions get vnderſtanding:Pr. 4.8. Exalt her and ſhee ſhall exalt thee: Shee ſhall bring thee vnto honour, if thou

embrace her:Pr. 4.9. ſhee ſhall giue a goodly ornament to thine head; yea, ſhe ſhall giue thee a crowne of glorie:
                  
                  
                     §. 3. Of Prouidence

                           What ſhee is,
                           What her obiects,
                           What her effectes,
                        
                     
                     
                        Ec. 8.5.
                        PRouidence is that wherby the heart of the wiſe fore-knoweth the time, and iudgement; the time when it will be; the iudgemēt how it will bee done:Ec. 8.6. both which are appointed to euery purpoſe vnder heauen: Not that man can fore-ſee all future things: No, he knoweth not that,Ec. 8.7. that ſhall be; For who can tel him when it ſhal be? not ſo much as cōcerning himſelfe.
                        Ec. 9.12. Neither doth man knowe his time, but as the fiſhes are taken

with an euill net, and as the birdes which are caught in the ſnare; ſo are the children of men ſnared in the euill time, when it falleth on them ſuddenly; yea,Pr. 20.24 the ſteps of a man are ruled by the Lord; how ſhould a man thē vnderſtand his owne way? but, ſometimes hee may: The prudent man ſeeth the plague afarre off,Pr 22.3 and fleeth; and as for good things,
                        Pr. 30.25. With the Piſmire hee prouideth his meat in ſummer; working ſtill according to fore-knowledge; yet not too ſtrictly, and fearefully;Ecc 11.4 for he that obſerueth the wind ſhall not ſowe, and he that regardeth the cloudes ſhall not reape.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 4. Of Diſcretion:

                           what it is,
                           what it worketh

                                 for our acts
                                 for our ſpeeches.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        Pr. 16.20.
                        DJſcretion is that whereby a man is wiſe in his buſineſſes, and whereby the heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely,Pr. 16.23. &amp; addeth doctrine to his lips. For actions:Pr. 14.15. The Prudent wil conſider his ſteps, and make choice of times: for,
                        Ec. 3.1. To all things there is an appointed time; and a time for euery purpoſe vnder heauen; a time to plant,Ec. 3.2. &amp; a time to pluck vp that which is planted; a time to ſlay,Ec. 3.3.3.4. Ec. 3.8. and a time to heale, &amp;c. A time of warre and a time of peace: From hence it is that the wiſe man is ſtrong,Pr. 24.5. 
                        and rich; for

by knowledge ſhall the Chambers be fild with precious things which he knows how to employ wel:Pr. 14.24 The crown of the wiſe is their riches; from hence, that his good vnderſtanding maketh him acceptable to others. For ſpeeches,
                        Pr. 13.15 
                        Pr. 15.2. The tongue of the wiſe vſeth knowledge aright,Pr. 10.13. 
                        &amp; in the lips of him that hath vnderſtanding wiſdome is found;Pr. 10.12. &amp; his words haue grace, both1 
                        for the ſeaſonablenes,
                        Pr. 25.11. A word ſpokē in his place is like apples of Gold with pictures of ſiluer,Pr. 15.23. &amp; how good is a word in due ſeaſō! 2 
                        for the worth of them,
                        Pr. 20.15. The lips of knowledge are a precios iewel; laſtly,
                        Pr. 14.3. 
                        for their vſe: the lips of the wiſe ſhall preſerv them, &amp; their toung is helth,Pr. 12.18
                        
                        and with health pleaſure;Pr. 16.24. Fayre wordes are as an hony-combe; ſweetneſſe to the ſoule; &amp; health to the bones.
                  
                  
                     §. 5. The extreames

                           Ouer-wiſe,
                           Fooliſh

                                 VVho hee is: what kinds there bee of Fooles;

                                       the meer foole:
                                       the raſh foole:
                                       the wicked fool.
                                    
                                 
                                 VVhat ſucceſſe.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        HEre are two extreams: On the right hand;Ec. 7.18. Make not thy ſelf ouer-wiſe, wherfore ſhouldſt thou be deſolate? on the left: Neither be fooliſh;Ec. 7.19. why ſhouldſt thou periſh,Pr. 21.16 not in thy time? The fool is that man that wandreth out of the waie of wiſdom, which hath none hart,Pr. 17.16 
                        that is, is deſtitute of vnderſtanding,Pr. 15.2. 
                        either to conceiue, or to do as he ought: Of which ſort

is, 1. The meere foole; That foole who when he goeth by the waie, his heart fayleth;Pr. 14.24. whoſe folly is fooliſhneſſe, in whoſe hand there is a price in vaine to get wiſdom,Pr. 17.16. 
                        which is too high for him to atain:Pr. 24.7. 
                        laſtly, In whom are not the lips of knowledge. 2. The raſh foole,
                        Pr. 14.7. that is haſtie in his matters,Pr. 29.20. 
                        Pr. 29.11. that povvreth out all his minde at once; which the wiſe man keepes in, till afterwarde;Pr. 19.2. 
                        that haſteth with his feet and therfore ſinneth.
                        Pr. 29.20 There is more hope of the other foole then of him. 3. The wicked foole:Pr. 1.7. That deſpiſeth wiſedome and inſtruction,Pr. 14.9. that maketh a mock of ſinne;Pr. 13.19 to whom it is an abhomination to depart from euill; to whom fooliſhneſſe is ioy,Pr. 15.21.
                        
                        yea,
                        Pr. 10.23. it is his paſtime to doe wickedly,Pr. 13 16. 
                        and his practice to ſpread abroad folly: And this man is obſtinate in his courſes;
                        Pr. 27.22. 
                        for tho thou bray a foole in a morter among wheat, brayd with a peſtell, yet wil not his fooliſhnes depart from him:Pr. 26.11. 
                        and tho it ſeem to depart, yet as a dog turneth again to his vomit, ſo returns hee to his fooliſhnes. Spare thy labor therfore, ſpeak not in the eares of a foole,Pr. 23.9. for he will deſpiſe the wiſdome of thy words.Pr. 1.22. 
                        To theſe ſaith wiſdome, O ye fooliſh, how long will ye loue fooliſhnes, and the ſcornfull take pleaſure in ſcorning, and fooles hate knowledge? Turne you at my correction.Pr. 1.23. Lo, I will powre out my mind vnto you; &amp; make

you vnderſtand my words.Pr. 1.24 Becauſe I haue called and ye refuſed, I haue ſtretched out my hād, and none would regard; But ye haue deſpiſed all my counſell,Pr. 1.25. and would none of my correction;Pr. 1.26. I will alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke vvhen your feare commeth;Pr. 1.27. like ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhall come like a whirlwinde; when affliction, and anguiſh ſhall come vppon you.Pr. 1.28. Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde me;Pr. 1.29. Becauſe they hated knovvledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lord; they would none of my counſel,Pr. 1.30.
                        
but deſpiſed all my correction; Therefore ſhall they eate of the fruite of their owne way,Pr. 1.31. and be filled vvith their owne deuiſes: and what is that fruit but ſorrow? Euen in laughing their heart is ſorrowfull;Pr. 14.13. and the end of that mirth is heauineſſe: and like the noiſe of thornes vnder a pot,Ec. 7.8. ſo (ſhort and vaine) is the laughter of fools:Pr. 10.13. 
                        what but ſtripes? A rod ſhall be for the back of him that is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: yea, it is proper to him. To the horſe belongeth a whip,Pr. 26.3. to the aſſe a bridle, &amp; a rod to the fools backe: wherewith not onely himſelfe ſhal be beaten,Pr. 10.8.10. but the companion of fools ſhal be afflicted:Pr. 13 20. 
                        Laſtly, what but death? Fooles

ſhall dy for want of wit,Pr. 10.21. and remain in the congregation of the dead;Pr. 21.16. 
                        Pr. 10.14 
                        yea the mouth of the foole is preſent deſtruction;Pr. 
                        and The lippes of a foole ſhall deuoure himſelfe, and that which ſhould ſeeme to preſerue him,

                        firſt, the feare of the Lord; and this feare of the Lord is to hate euil, as pride, arrogancie, and the euill way; and in all

our waies to acknowledge God;Pr. 3.6. that he may direct our waies; ſo that,
                        Pr. 14.2 he that walketh in his righteouſnes, feareth the Lord; but hee that is lewd in his wayes deſpiſeth him: which grace, as it is the beginning of knowledge,Pr. 1.7.

If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for hir as treaſures; then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lord,Pr. 2.5. and finde the knovvledge of God; And this feare giues both contentment; Better is a little with the feare of the Lord,Pr. 15.16. then great treaſure, and trouble therwith;

                        Pr. 20.25 It is deſtruction to a man, to deuoure that which is ſanctified; and after the vowes to inquire. Neither this to God onely, but to man;Pr. 12.22. They that deale truly are his delight;Pr. 28.10. and the vpright ſhall inherite good things: yea,

                           The iudgement attending it.
                        
                     
                     
                        COntrary to this is Deceit: whether in a colour;Pr. 26.18. As hee that faineth himſelf mad, caſteth firebrands, arrowes, and mortall things; ſo dealeth the deceitfull man, &amp; ſaith, Am I not in ſport?Pr. 26.19. 
                        Pr. 12.20. 
                        As this deceit is in the heart of them that imagine euill: ſo in their hands are Diuers weights,Pr. 20.10. and diuers balances: or directly,
                        Pr. 29.24. Hee that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule, and dangerous are the wayes of him that is greedy of gaine;Pr. 1.19. 
                        much more publiquely, I haue

ſeene the place of iudgement,Ec. 3.16. where was wickedneſſe; and the place of iuſtice vvhere was iniquitie:Ec. 3.17. I thought in mine heart God will iudge the iuſt and the wicked,Pr. 12.27. 
                        yea oft-times ſpeedily; ſo as The deceitfull man roaſteth not what he tooke in hunting: or if he eate it;Pr. 20.17. The bread of deceit is ſweet to a man, but afterward his mouth ſhal be filled with grauell.

                           whether in rayſing ill rumours,
                           or whether by preſſing matters too farre.

                        THE firſt is hee that raiſeth contentions among brethren: which once raiſed are not ſo ſoone appeaſed.
                        Pr. 18.19. A brother offended is harder to win thē a ſtrong city: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.Pr. 16.29. 
                        This is that violent man that deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good, the way of diſcord: whether by ill rumours;Pr. 18.6. The fooles lips come with ſtrife; and as the coale maketh burning coales,Pr. 26.21. and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife; and that euen

among great ones,
                        Pr. 16.28. A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife, and a talebearer maketh diuiſion among Princes; or by preſſing matters too farre: When one churneth milk,Pr. 30.33 he bringeth forth butter; and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth forth ſtrife, the end wherof is neuer good:Pr. 29.9. for it a wiſe man contend with a fooliſh man, whether he bee angry or laugh, there is no reſt.

To it ſelfe;Pr. 14.30. A ſound heart is the life of the fleſh; but enuy is the rotting of the bones.Pr. 27.4. 2. To others; Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie? But of all other it is moſt vniuſt, when it is ſet vpon an euill ſubiect.

                        no vertue is more gainfull: for By mercy and trueth iniquity ſhall bee forgiuen;Pr. 3.4.

                        Yea All the brethren of the poore hate him: how much more will his friendes depart from him? though he be inſtant with wordes, yet they will not.
                     2. There is a generation,Pr. 30.14. whoſe teeth are as ſwordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the

earth.Pr. 22.16. Theſe are they that oppreſſe the poore to increaſe themſelues, and giue to the rich; that rob the poore,Pr. 22.22. becauſe he is poore, and oppreſſe the afflicted in iudgemēt; that take away the garment in the cold ſeaſon,Pr. 25.20.

                        Ec. 4.1. I turned and conſidered all the oppreſſions that are wrought vnder the Sunne; and behold the teares of the oppreſſed, and none comforteth them; and the ſtrength is of the hand of thoſe that oppreſſe them, &amp; none comforteth them.

None? Yes ſurely, aboue.
                        Ec. 5.7. If in a country thou ſeeſt the oppreſſion of the poore, and the defrauding of iudgement, and iuſtice, bee not aſtonied at the matter; for he that is hyer then the hyeſt regardeth, and there bee hyer then they, which will defend the cauſe of the poore,Pr. 22.23. to cauſe the oppreſſour to come to pouerty:Pr. 22.16.

We will ſwallow them vp aliue like a Graue,Pr. 1.12. euen whole; as thoſe that goe downe into the pit;Pr. 1.15. But, my ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foot from their path: For their feet run to euill,Pr. 1.16. and make haſte to blood-ſhed.Pr. 1.17. Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpred before the eyes of all that hath wings:Pr. 1.18. So they lay wait for blood, &amp; lie priuily for their liues;Pr. 12 10. Thus the mercies of the wicked are cruell: But ſhall they preuaile in this?
                        Pr. 26.2. The cauſeleſſe curſe ſhall not come:Pr. 24.16. The iuſt man may fall ſeuen times in a

day, but hee riſeth vp againe, whiles the wicked ſhall fall into miſchief; Yea into the ſame they had deuiſed:Pr. 26.27. Hee that diggeth a pit ſhall fall therein; and he that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhall fall vpon him, and cruſh him to death:
                        Pr. 28.17 
                        for He that doth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhall flee vnto the Graue, and they ſhall not ſtay him.

All the labour of man is for his mouth,Ec. 6.7 and yet the ſoule is not filled: yea this is the curſe that God hath ſet vpon him;Ec. 5.9 He that loueth ſiluer ſhall not be ſatisfied with ſiluer: and he that loueth riches ſhal be without the fruite thereof;Pr. 18.11 Pr. 11.28

                        and by his ſparing commeth ſurely to pouertie. All this while hee ſets his eyes on that which is nothing,Pr. 23.5

O yong man, in thy youth, and let thine heart cheere thee in the dayes of thy youth, &amp; walke in the wayes of thine heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes; but know, that for all theſe things God will bring thee to iudgement.

                           Humility,
                           Pride—

                                 ouerweening

                                       Wherein it is,
                                       How abſurd,
                                       How dangerous.
                                    
                                 
                                 ſcornefulneſſe.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        NExt to the modest, is the humble in ſpirit;Pr. 29.23. 
                        Hee ſaith, Surely,Pr. 30.2. I am more fooliſh then aman, &amp; haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me;Pr. 30.3. for I haue not learned wiſedome, and haue not attained to the knowledge of holy things: But doth he want it ere the more?
                        Pr. 11.2. 
                        No: With the lowly is wiſedome,Pr. 13.31. 
                        and The eare that hearkeneth to the corrections of life, ſhall lodge among the wiſe:Pr. 16.19. Better it is, therefore, to bee of an humble mind with

the lowely, then to diuide the ſpoyles with the proud: for before honour goeth humilitie;Pr. 15.33 Pr. 18.12 
                        and hee that confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſinnes,Pr. 28.13. ſhall haue mercy; yea,
                        Pr. 29.23. the humble of ſpirit ſhall inioy glory:Pr. 22.24. 
                        and the rewarde of humilitie, &amp; the feare of God, is riches, and glory and life.
                     
                        Contrary whereto;Pr. 30.13. There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eye lids are lift vp;Pr. 30.12. There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceit, and yet are not waſhed from their filthineſſe. Yea, All the wayes of a man are cleane in his own eies:Pr. 16.2. Pr. 21.2. but the Lord pondereth: the ſpirits; and not ſonnely, but Many men will boaſt of their goodnes;Pr. 20.6.
                        
                        but It is not good to eate much honie,Pr. 25.27. ſo to ſearch their owne glory is not glory; Let another man prayſe thee,Pr. 27.2. and not thine owne mouth; a ſtranger and not thy owne lips: This ouer-weening is commonly incident to great men. The rich man is wiſe in his owne conceit,Pr. 28.11. but the poore that hath vnderſtanding can trie him: Hence it is, that he affects ſingularity;Pr. 18.1. According to his deſire, he that ſeparates himſelf, will ſeeke, and occupy himſelfe in all wiſedome:Pr. 16.12. 
                        but Seeſt thou a man thus wiſe in his owne conceit, there is more hope of a foole then of him: yea, he is a foole in this: In the mouth of the fooliſh,Pr. 14.3. is the rod of pride;Ec. 7.25. I thought, I will be

wiſe, but it went farre from me; it is farre off, what may it bee?Ec. 7.26. 
                        and that, a wicked foole;Pr. 21.4. A hautie looke, and a proud heart which is the light of the wicked is ſin: If therefore thou haſt bene fooliſh in lifting vp thy ſelfe,Pr. 30.32. and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vpon thy mouth, for God hateth an hauty eye;Pr. 6.17. 
                        yea he ſo hateth it,
                        Pr. 16.5. 
                        that al that are proud in heart, are an abomination to the Lord: and tho hand ioyne in hand, they ſhall not be vnpuniſhed; and what puniſhment ſhall be bane?Pr. 15.25▪
                         The Lord will deſtroy the houſe of the proud man; and his very pride is an argument of his ruine: Before deſtruction the heart of a man is haughty:Pr. 18.22 Pride

goeth before deſtruction,Pr. 16.18. and an hie mind before the fall: Before it?
                        Pr. 11.2. 
                        yea with it: When pride commeth, then cōmeth ſhame. Now the height of pride is ſcornefulneſse. Hee that is proud and haughty,Pr. 21.24. ſcornefull is his name, who worketh in the pride of his wrath:Pr. 11.12. and this man deſpiſeth his neighbour, and therefore is deſtitute of underſtanding: when the wicked commeth▪
                        Pr. 18.3 then commeth contempt; and with the vile man is reproche, but▪ of all, him that reproues him:Pr. 9.7. Hee that reproueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame, and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blo

                              •
                           . 
                        therefore Iudgements are prepared for the ſcorners,

and ſtripes for the backe of fooles; ſo, as others are hurt by his ſinne;
                        Pr. 29.8. 
                        for a ſcornefull man bringeth a whole citie into a ſnare: ſo they ſhall bee likewiſe bettered by his iudgement; when the ſcorner is puniſhed,Pr. 21.11. the fooliſh is wiſe.

                        OF the firſt kind,
                        Pr. 5.15. 
                        is hee that drinkes the waters of his owne ciſterne;Pr. 6.25. that deſires not the beautie of a ſtranger in his heart; neither lets her take him with her eye-lids: contrarily,
                        Pr. 5.20. 
                        the incōtinent is he that delights in a ſtrange woman, &amp; imbraces the boſome of a ſtranger; or ſhe that

                        Ec. 7.28. I finde more bitter then death the woman whoſe heart is as nets and ſnares,See more of this vice, Oecon. ſect. 2. &amp; 3. and whoſe hands as bands: hee that is good before God ſhall bee deliuered from her, but the ſinner ſhall be taken by her.
                     
                        Pr. 16 32.
                        Of the ſecond, is he that is ſlow to anger,Pr. 14.29. ſlow to wrath; whoſe diſcretion differreth his anger,Pr. 19.11. and whoſe glory is to paſſe by an offence:Pr. 14.29. 
                        which moderation, as it argues him to bee of great

wiſedome (for wiſe men turne away wrath) ſo it makes him better then the mightie man,Pr. 29.8. 
                        Pr. 16.23. 
                        and procures him iust honour;
                        Pr. 20.3. 
                        for It is the honour of a man to ceaſe from ſtrife: cōtrary to which, is he that is of an haſty ſpirit to be angry; which as it proues him fooliſh:Ec. 7.11. (for anger reſteth in the boſom of fooles,Ec. 7.11. 
                        Pr. 14.17 
                        and he that is haſtie to anger, not onely committeth folly,Pr. 14.29. 
                        but exalteth it) So it makes him dangerous: Anger is cruell,Pr. 27.4. and wrath is raging;Pr. 29.22. 
                        and a furious man aboundeth in trangreſſions:Pr. 22.24. 
                        wherefore make no friendſhippe with an angry man,Pr. 22.25. leaſt thou learne his wayes, and receiue deſtruction to thy ſoule.

                        Pr. 18.14.
                        FOrtitude is that, whereby The ſpirit of a man ſuſteines his infirmities; which makes the righteous bold as a lyon:Pr. 28.1. 
                        contrarily the weake of ſtrength is he that is faint in the day of aduerſitie;Pr. 24.10. 
                        whoſe feare bringeth a ſnare vpon him;Pr. 29.25. 
                        and that, deſperate: A wounded ſpirit who can beare?Pr. 18.14. 
                        which is often cauſed through guiltineſſe:Pr. 28.1. The wicked fleeth, when none purſueth him. Confidence is,
                        Pr. 3.5. 
                        to truſt in the Lord with all thine heart, and not to leane

to thine owne wiſedome;Pr. 3.6. 
                        but in all thy wayes to acknowledge him,Pr. 16.3. 
                        and to commit thy works to the Lord,Pr. 14.32. 
                        and to haue hope in thy death: and tho in other things, The hope that is deferred is the fainting of the heart;Pr. 13.12. 
                        yet in this, hee that truſteth in the Lord ſhall bee fatte; for,
                        Pr. 28.25. 
                        from hence,
                        Pr. 16.3. Pr. 3.6. 
                        not onely his thoughts and wayes are directed, but he receiueth ſafetie, and protection;Pr. 30.5. He is a ſhield to thoſe that truſt in him. The horſe is prepared for the day of battaile,Pr. 21.31. but ſaluation is of the Lord. Yea, The name of the Lord is a ſtrong tower:Pr. 18.12 the righteous runneth to it, and is exalted. So that,
                        Pr. 16.20. Hee that truſteth in

the Lord, he is bleſſed; whereas Hee that truſteth in his owne heart,Pr. 28.26. is a foole: and it is a vaine thing,
                        Pr. 27.1. to boaſt thy ſelfe of to morrow; for thou knoweſt not what a day will bring forth.
                     
                        Pr. 3.11.
                        Patience is, not to refuſe the chaſtening of the Lord, neither to be grieued with his correction:Ec. 7.16. 
                        The patient man, in the day of wealth, is of good comfort, and in the day of affliction conſidereth, God alſo hath made this contrary to that, that man ſhould finde nothing after him whereof to complaine: knowing that the Lord correcteth whom hee loueth;Pr. 3.12. 
                        Pr. 10.28 
                        and that the patient abiding of the righteous ſhall bee gladneſſe: Contrarily, The heart

of the foole, fretteth againſt the Lord; he is careleſſe and rageth:Pr. 19.3. 
                        but to what purpoſe?
                        Ec. 6.10. Man cannot ſtriue with him that is ſtronger then he: Yea rather,
                        Pr. 29.1. the man that hardeneth his necke when hee is rebuked, ſhall ſuddenly bee deſtroyed, and cannot bee cured: in reſpect of mens iniuries,
                        Pr. 20.22. He ſaith not, I will recompence euill; but waits vpon the Lord, and he ſhall ſaue him. In which regard, the patient in ſpirit that ſuffers, is better then the proud of ſpirit,Ec. 7.10. 
                        that requites.

                        Pr. 18.22HE that findeth a vviſe, findeth a good thing, and receiueth fauour of the Lord: Who muſt therefore behaue himſelfe, 1. wiſely,
                        Pr. 2.17. 
                        Pr. 12.4. 
                        as the guide of her youth: as the heade to which ſhee is a crowne:Pr. 5.15 2. chaſtely. Drink the water of thy owne Ciſtern, and the riuers out of the midſt of thine owne Well. The matrimoniall loue muſt be pure, and cleare, not muddy and troubled;Pr. 5.16 Let thy fountaines flowe forth, and the riuers of waters in the Streets;

                        the ſweet &amp; comfortable fruits of bleſſed marriage, in plentifull iſſue:Pr. 5.17 But let them bee thine alone, and not the ſtrangers with thee. This loue abides no partners: for,
                        Pr. 5.9. this vvere to giue thine honour vnto others, and thy ſtrength to the cruell;Pr. 5.10 ſo ſhould the ſtranger be filled with thy ſtrength, and (as the ſubſtance will be with the affections) thy laboures ſhould bee in the houſe of a ſtranger; and thou ſhalt mourne (which is the beſt ſucceſse heereof) at thine ende,Pr. 5.11 vvhen thou haſt conſumed (beſides thy goods) thy fleſh, and thy body, and ſay:Pr. 5.12 How haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correctiō.Pr. 5.14 I was almoſt

                        plunged into all euill, of ſinne and torments, and that which is moſt ſhamefull, in the midſt of the aſſembly,Pr. 5.18 
                        in the face of the world. Let therfore that thy owne fountaine be bleſſed, and reioice with the wiſe of thy youth: Let her be as the louing Hinde,Pr. 5.19 and pleaſant Roe; let her breaſts ſatisfie thee,Pr. 5.20 at all times, and erre thou in her loue continually; For why ſhouldſt thou delight my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman; or (whether in affection, or acte) embrace the boſome of a ſtranger?Pr. 5.21 For, the vvayes of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and hee pondereth all his pathes: and if thy godleſneſſe regarde not that, yet for thy owne ſake, Deſire not

her beautie in thy heart,Pr. 6.25 neyther let her take thee with her eie-lids; for,Pr. 6.26. becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought to a morſell of bread, yea to the very huskes: and more then that; a VVoman will hunt for the precious life of a man. Thou ſayeſt,
                        Pr. 6.26 
                        thou canst eſcape this actuall defilement.
                        Pr. 6.27 Can a man take fire in his boſome, and his cloathes not bee burnt?Pr. 6.28 Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt? So,Pr. 6.29 hee that goeth in, to his Neighbours Wife, ſhall not bee innocent, vvhoſoeuer toucheth her: This Sinne is farre more odious then thefte: For,
                        Pr. 6.30 men doo not deſpiſe a Thiefe when

hee ſteales to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe hee is hungrie. But if hee be found,Pr. 6.31 hee ſhall reſtore ſeauen folde, or he ſhall giue all the ſubſtance of his houſe; and it is accepted.
                        Pr. 6.32 But, hee that commits adultery with a woman, is mad: he that would deſtroy his owne ſoule,Pr. 6.33 let him doe it: For, he ſhall finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproache ſhall neuer bee put avvaie: Neither is the daunger leſſe then the ſhame. For,Pr. 6.34 ielouſie is the rage of a man: therefore▪ 
                        the wronged husband will not ſpare, in the day of vengeance.Pr. 6.35 Hee cannot beare the ſight of any raunſome; neither will he conſent to remit it, tho thou multiplie thy giftes. And

                        tho Stollen waters be ſweet,Pr. 9.17. and hid bread be pleaſant to our corrupt taſte; yet,Pr. 9.18. 
                        the adulterer knowes not that the dead are there: and that her gueſts are in the deepes of hell, that her houſe tendeth to death;Pr. 2.18.19. Pr. 5.3. 
                        And howſoeuer her lips drop as an hony-combe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle; yet the end of her is bitter as wormewood,Pr. 5.4. &amp; ſharpe as a two edged ſword: her feete goe downe to death,Pr. 5.5. and her ſteps take hold of hell: yea,
                        Pr. 23.27. The mouth of the ſtrange woman is a deepe pit,Pr. 22.14. 
                        and hee with whom the Lord is angry ſhall fall into it.
                     3. Quietly and louingly: for,
                        Pr. 15.17 Betteris a dinner of green herbs

where loue is, then a ſtalled oxe, and hatred therewith. Yea, Better is a dry morſell,Pr. 17.1. if peace be with it; then an houſe full of ſacrifices with ſtrife. And if he find ſometime cauſe of blame;Pr. 19.11. The diſcretion of a man differreth his anger, and his glory is to paſſe by an offence:Pr. 17.9. 
                        and onely He that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue:Ec. 9.9. Reioyce with thy wife, whom thou haſt loued all the dayes of the life of thy vanitie, which God hath giuen thee vnder the Sunne. For, this is thy portion in this life, and in the trauels wherein thou laboureſt vnder the Sunne.

                        ſuch one as I once ſaw from the window of my houſe: I looked through my window,Pr. 7.7. &amp; ſaw

among the fooles,Pr. 7.7. &amp; conſidered among the children a yong man wanting wit,Pr. 7.8. who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, and went toward her houſe, in the twi-light,Pr. 7.9. in the euening, when the night began to bee blacke and darke, ſo as hee thought himſelfe vnſeene;Pr. 7.10. and behold there met him (the ſame he ſought for) a woman with an harlots faſhion, and cloſe in heart, as open in her habite.
                        Pr. 7.11. She is babbling and peruerſe; whoſe feete (contrary to the manner of all modeſt wiues,
                        Pr. 11.16. which onely attaine honour) cannot abide in her houſe;Pr. 7.11. 
                        but are ouer gadding.
                        Pr. 7.12. Now ſhee is without the gates, now in the ſtreetes,Pr. 23.28. and lyeth in wayte in

euery corner; or at the leaſt, ſitteth at the doore of her houſe,Pr. 9.14. on a ſeat in the hie places of the city: ſo ſhe (not staying to be ſolicited) caught him by the necke,
                        Pr. 7.13. and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face, ſaid vnto him, I haue the fleſh of peace offrings,Pr. 7.14. (both good cheere, and religion pretended) this day haue I paid my vowes:Pr. 7.15. therefore I came foorth, on purpoſe to meete thee, that I might earneſtly ſeeke thy face, of all others; and now, how happy am J that J haue found thee.Pr. 7.16. I haue decked my bedde with ornaments, with curtaines, and ſtrings of Egypt.Pr. 7.17. I haue perfumed my bedde with myrrhe, aloes, and cinnamon, that wee

may lie ſweet;Pr. 7.18. Come goe, let vs take our fill of loues, vntill the morning, let vs take our pleaſure in dalliance; feare nothing,
                        Pr. 7.19. For my husband is not at home, hee is gone a iourney farre off, neither needeſt thou to doubt his returne; for he hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer,Pr. 7.20. and will come home at his ſet day: ſooner hee cannot; this ſhee ſaid: what followed? By the abundance of the ſweetneſſe of her ſpeech,Pr. 7.21. ſhee cauſed him to yeeld: and with the flatterie of her lippes, ſhe intiſed him;Pr. 7.22. and ſtraight wayes hee followes her as an oxe goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a foole to the ſtockes for correction,

till a dart ſtrike through his liuer, the ſeate of his luſt:
                        Pr. 7.23. 
                        or as a birde haſteneth to the ſnare, and knoweth not that it is againſt his owne life: thus ſhee doeth, and when her huſband returnes,
                        Pr. 30.20. ſhee wipeth her mouth, and ſaith I haue not committed iniquitie. (2.) She is duetifull and obedient;Pr. 15.1. by a ſoft anſwere appeaſing wrath: not hatefull; for whom,
                        Pr. 30.23.21. a whole world is mooued; not ſtubborne, not quarellous: for,
                        Pr. 19.13 Pr. 27.15 the contentions (and brawlings) of a wife, are like a continuall dropping in the day of raine; a diſcomfort to the huſband, a rotting to the houſe. So,
                        Pr. 25.24. It is better to dwell in a

corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe. And tho, for ſociety, Two bee better then one;Ec. 4.9. 
                        yet It is better to dwell alone in the wilderneſſe,Pr. 27.19. then with a contentious, and angry woman. For, herein as his griefe cannot be auoyded, ſo his ſhame cannot bee conceiued.
                        Pr. 27.16. 
                        For, Hee that hideth her, hideth the winde; and ſhe is as oyle in his right hand, that vttereth it ſelfe.

                     3. SHe is moreouer prudent, and diſcreet.Pr. 14.1. A wiſe woman buildeth her houſe; but the fooliſh deſtroyeth it with her owne hands:Pr. 11.22. 
                        and As a ring of gold in a ſwines ſnowt, ſo is a faire woman which lacketh diſcretion. 4. Lastly, ſhee is carefull

and houſ-wifelike; ſo as She will doe her husband good,Pr. 31.12. and not euill, all the dayes of her life: For, as for her actions, in her owne perſon, whether you looke to her labours;Pr. 31.13. Shee ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hands.Pr. 31.15. She riſeth while it is yet night:Pr. 31.17. She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.Pr. 31.19. Shee putteth her hands to the wheele; and her hands handle the ſpindle: or whether, to her bargaines; She conſidereth a field,Pr. 31.16. and getteth it, and with the fruit of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.Pr. 31.14. Shee is like the ſhippe of merchants, ſhee bringeth her food from farre; ſhee feeleth

that her merchandiſe is good, her candle is not put out by night:Pr. 31.18. ſhee maketh ſheets &amp; ſelleth them,Pr. 31.24. and giueth girdles vnto the merchants; or whether, to her liberall prouiſion; For her husband,
                        Pr. 31.23. who is knowen in the gates (by her neate furniſhing) when hee ſits with the Elders of the land; 2. For her ſelfe, Shee maketh her ſelfe carpets:Pr. 31.22. fine linnen &amp; purple is her garment; 3. For her ſeruants,
                        Pr. 31.21. Shee feareth not the ſnow for her family, for all her familie is clothed with ſcarlet; 4. For the poore,
                        Pr. 31.20· Shee ſtretcheth out her hands to the poore, and putteth foorth her hands to the needy; For her ouerſight of her familie, ſhe giueth

the portion to her houſehold,Pr. 13.15. and the ordinary (or ſtint of work) to her maids: ſhe ouerſeeth the wayes of her houſehold,Pr. 13.27. and eateth not the bread of idleneſſe. For her ſpeeches; ſhe openeth her mouth with wiſedome,Pr. 31.26. and the lawe of grace is in her tongue. Laſtly, Strength and honour is her clothing,Pr. 31.25. and in the latter day ſhee ſhall reioyce. So worthie ſhee is in all theſe,
                        Pr. 31.28. 
                        that her owne children cannot containe, but riſe vp and call her bleſſed; and her husband ſhall prayſe her, and ſay,
                        Pr. 31.29. Many daughters haue done vertuouſly, but thou ſurmounteſt them all: Fauour is deceitfull,Pr. 31.30. and beautie is vanitie;

but a woman that feareth the Lord, ſhee ſhall be praiſed: Since therefore ſhee is ſo well deſeruing,
                        Pr. 31.31. Giue her of the fruit of her owne hands, and let her owne workes prayſe her.
                  
                  
                     PARENTS: §. 5. Who owe to their children

                           Prouiſion,
                           Inſtruction,
                           Correction.
                        
                     
                     
                        PArents and Children are the next payre; which doe giue much ioy to each other:Pr. 17.6. Childrens children are the Crowne of the elders, and the glory of the children are their fathers: To which purpoſe, the Parent oweth to the Childe, 1. Prouiſion.
                        
A good man ſhall giue inheritance to his childrens children.Pr. 13.22. All the labour, wherein hee hath trauelled,Ec. 2.18. he ſhall leaue to the man that ſhall be after him.Ec. 2.19. And who knoweth whether hee ſhall be wiſe or fooliſh: yet ſhal he rule ouer all his labour wherein hee hath laboured, and ſhewed himſelfe wiſe, vnder the ſunne. Here are therefore two groſse vanities, which I haue ſeene:Ec. 4.8. 
                        the one, There is one alone, &amp; there is not a ſecond, which hath neither ſonne nor brother: yet is there none end of his trauell, neither can his eye be ſatisfied with riches; neither doth he thinke, for whom do I trauell, and defraud my ſoule of pleaſure. The other, contrary;

riches reſerued to the owners thereof for their euill.Ec. 5.12. And theſe riches periſh in his euill buſineſs;Ec. 5.13. and he begetteth a ſonne, and in his hand is nothing. 2.Pr. 1.8. Inſtructiō 
                        and good education: for,
                        Pr. 17.21. He that begetteth a foole (whether naturally, or by ill breeding) begetteth himſelfe ſorrow: and the father of a foole can haue no ioy. And therefore,
                        Pr. 22.6. Teach a child in the trade of his way: and when he is olde, hee ſhall not depart from it. 3. Correction:Pr. 13.24. He that ſpareth his rodde, hateth his ſonne: but he that loueth him, chaſteneth betime;Pr. 22.15. for fooliſhneſſe is bound in the heart of a child: the rodde of correction ſhall driue it from him:

                        yea, there is yet great benefit of due chasticement;
                        Pr. 29.15 
                        for, The rodde and correction giue life: but a child ſet at libertie makes his mother (who is commonly faulty this way) aſhamed; yea, more them ſhame, death and hell follow to the child vpon indulgence: (onely) If thou ſmite him with the rod,Pr. 23.13 hee ſhall not die: if thou ſmite him with the rod,Pr. 25.14 thou ſhalt deliuer his ſoule from hell.Pr. 4.3. 
                        Tho thy ſonne therefore be tender and deare in thy ſight;Pr. 29.17 Correct him, and hee will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſures to thy ſoule: wherefore,
                        Pr. 19.18. Chaſten him while there is hope; and let not thy ſoule ſpare,Pr. 19.19. to his deſtruction. The ſonne that is of a great ſtomach,

ſhall indure puniſhment: and tho thou deliuer him, yet thou ſhalt take him in hand againe.

                     A Wiſe Sonne reioyceth the Father,Pr. 15.20 Pr. 10.1. 
                        Pr. 23.24 
                        and The Father of the righteous ſhall greatlie reioyce; vvhereas,
                        Pr. 19.13. The fooliſh is the calamitie of his Parents: Contrarilie, if thou bee

a wiſe ſonne,Pr. 29.3 
                        or loueſt wiſdome, thy father &amp; thy mother ſhall be glad,Pr. 23.25 and ſhe that bare thee ſhall reioice. Such a one is, firſt, Obedient;
                        Pr. 13.1 
                        for, A wiſe ſon will heare and obey the inſtruction of his father,Pr. 1.8. and not forſake his mothers teaching; yea, in euery command,
                        pr. 23.22 Pr. 6.20 he will obey him that begot him, and not deſpiſe his mother when ſhe is olde; not vpon any occaſion curſing his parents (as there is a generation that doth):Pr. 30.11 
                        for,
                        Pr. 20.20 He that curſeth his father, or mother, his light ſhall be put out in obſcure darkneſs; not mocking &amp; ſcorning them;
                        Pr. 15.20. 
                        pr. 30.17 
                        for, The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, the rauens of the vally ſhall

picke it out, and the young Eagles eate it: and not obedient to counſell only, but to ſtripes; Hee that hateth correction is a foole:Pr. 12.1 and he that regardeth it,Pr. 15.5 is prudent. For,
                        Pr. 6.23 thoſe corrections that are for inſtruction, are the waie of life: therfore, hee that hateth them ſhall die. Secondly,
                        Pr. 15.10

                        panion of a man that deſtroieth; and

right:Pr. 23.16. 
                        ſo his fathers reynes ſhall reioice, when he ſpeaketh &amp; doth righteous things.
                  
                  
                     The MAISTER, &amp; SERVANT. §. 7.

                           The maſter muſt be

                                 Prouident for his ſeruant:
                                 Not

                                       too ſeuere,
                                       too familiar.
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                           The ſeruant muſt be

                                 faithfull,
                                 diligent.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        THe ſeruant is no ſmall commodity to his master.
                        Pr. 12.9. Hee that is deſpiſed, &amp; hath a ſeruant of his own is better then he that boaſts (whether of gentry, or wealth) &amp; wanteth bread. The maſter, therefore,
                        Pr. 27.27. 
                        muſt prouide ſufficiency of foode for his family, and ſuſtenance for his maydes: who alſo

as hee may not bee ouer-rigorous in puniſhing, or noting offences; ſometimes not hearing his ſeruant,Ec. 7.23 that curſeth him: ſo not too familiar;
                        Pr. 29.21 
                        for he that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruant from his youth, at length he wil be as his ſonne. He muſt therefore be ſometimes ſeuere, more then in rebukes; (For,
                        Pr. 29.19. A ſeruant will not bee chaſticed with words: and tho he vnderſtand, yet he will not regarde) yet ſo, as hee haue reſpect euer to his good deſeruings.
                        Pr. 17.2. A diſcreet ſeruant ſhall rule ouer a levvde ſonne: and he ſhall diuide the heritage among the brethren. Jn anſwer whereto, the good ſeruant must bee faithfull vnto his maſter;Pr. 25.13 As the colde of ſnovve in time of

harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him, for he refreſheth the ſoule of his maſter.Pr. 13.17. A wicked meſſenger falleth into euil: but a faithfull ambaſſadour is preſeruation;Pr. 27.23. 
                        and 
                        2 
                        diligent, Whether in his charge; Be diligent to knowe the eſtate of thy flock (or rather, the face of thy cattel) and take heed to the heardes: or in his attendance,
                        Pr. 27.18 Hee that keepeth his fig-tree ſhall eate of the fruite of it: ſo hee that carefully waiteth on his maſter, ſhall come to honour,Pr. 10.26 
                        where contrarily, in both theſe, As vinegar to the teeth, and ſmoke to the eyes: ſo is a ſlouthfull meſſenger to them that ſend him.

                  AN OPEN AND plaine Paraphraſe, vpon the SONG OF SONGS, Which is SALOMONS.
                  By IOS. HALL.
                  
                  Anno Domini, 1609.
                  
               
               
                  
                  
                  TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, MY Singular good Lord &amp; Patron, EDVVARD Lord Denny, Baron of Waltham, All Grace &amp; Happineſſe.
                  
                     RIGHT HONOVRABLE:
                  
                  
                     WHen I would haue withdrawen my hand from diuine Salomon: the heauenly elegance of this his beſt Song drewe me vnto it; and would not ſuffer me to take off mine eies, or pen. Who can read it with vnderſtanding, &amp; not bee tranſported from the world;

from himſelfe? and be any other where, ſaue in heauen, before his time? I had rather ſpende my time in admiration, then Apology: Surely, heere is nothing that ſauours not of extaſie, and ſpirituall rauiſhment; neither was there euer ſo high and paſſionate a ſpeculation deliuered by the ſpirit of God, to mankind: which by how much more diuine it is, by ſo much more difficult: It is wel, if theſe myſteries can be found out by ſearching. Two things make the Scriptures hard: Prophecies, Allegories; both are met in this: but the latter ſo ſenſibly to the weakeſt eyes, that this whole Paſtoral-mariage-ſong (for ſuch it is) is no other then one Allegory ſweetly continued: where the deepeſt things of God are ſpoken in riddles, how can there be but obſcurity &amp; diuers conſtruction? All iudgements will not (I know) ſubſcribe to my ſenſes; yet I haue beene fearefull and ſpiritually nice in my choice, not often diſſenting

from all interpreters; alwaies, from the vnlikelieſt. It would bee too tedious to giue my account for euery line: let the learned ſcanne and iudge. What-euer others cenſures be, your Honours was fauourable; and (as to all mine) full of loue and incouragement. That, therefore, which it pleaſed you to allow from my penne, vouchſafe to receiue from the Preſſe; more common, not leſſe deuoted to you. What is there of mine that doth not ioy in your name, and boaſt it ſelfe in ſeruing you? To whoſe ſoule and people, I haue long agone addicted my ſelfe, and my labours; and ſhall euer continue
                  
                     Your Lordſhips, in all humble &amp; vnfained dutie, IOS. HALL.

                           OH that he would beſtovve vpon me the comfortable teſtimonies of his loue,
                              1 Let him kiſſe me, with the kiſſes of his mouth; for, thy loue is better then wine. and that hee would vouchſafe me yet a neerer coniunction with himſelfe; as in glory hereafter, ſo for the meane time in his ſenſible graces. For, thy loue, O my Sauiour,

and theſe fruites of it, are more ſweet vnto me, then all earthly delicates can bee to the bodily taſte.
                        
                           
                              2. Becauſe of the ſauour of thy good ointmēts, thy name is as an oinmēt powred out: therfore the Virgins loue theeYea, ſo wonderfully pleaſant are the ſauours of thoſe graces that are in thee, wherewith I deſire to be indued; that al, whom thou haſt bleſſed with the ſenſe thereof, make as high and deare account of thy Goſpell, vvhereby they are wrought, as of ſome precious oyntment, or perfume: the delight whereof is ſuch, that (heereuppon) the pure and holy ſoules of the faithfull, place their whole affection, vpon thee.
                        
                           Pull me therefore out from the bondage of my ſinnes:

then will we reioyce and bee glad in none, but thee; which ſhalt be all in all to vs: then will wee celebrate and magnifie thy loue, aboue all the pleaſures we found vpō earth; for, all of vs thy righteous ones, both Angels and Saints, are inflamed with the loue of thee.
                        
                           
                              4. I am black O daughters of Ieruſalē, but comely: If I be as the tents of Kedar, yet I am as the curtaines of Salomon.
                           Neuer vpbraid mee (O ye forraine congregations) that I ſeeme in outward appearance diſcoloured by my infirmities, and duskiſh with tribulations: for, what ſoeuer I ſeeme to you, I am yet inwardly wel-fauoured in the eyes of him, whom I ſeeke to pleaſe; and tho I bee to you blacke like the tents of the Arabian ſhepherds: yet to

him and in him, I am glorious and beautiful, like the curtains of Salomon.
                        
                        Looke not therefore diſdainefully vpon me,
                              5. Regard yee me not, becauſe I am blacke: for the ſun hath looked vpon me; the ſons of my mother were angry againſt me: they made m

                               owne vine. becauſe I am blackiſh, &amp; darke of hew: for, this colour is not ſo much naturall to me; as cauſed by that continuall heate of afflictions wherewith I haue bene vſually ſcorched: neither this, ſo much vpon my owne iuſt deſert, as vpon the rage and enuie of my falſe brethren, the World: who would needs force vpon me the obſeruation of their idolatrous religions, and ſuperſtitious impieties; through whoſe wicked importunitie, and my owne

weakeneſſe, I haue not ſo intirely kept the ſincere truth of God committed to me, as I ought.
                        
                           
                              6. Shew me, O thou whom my ſoule loueth, where thou feedeſt, where thou lieſt at noon: for why ſhold I be as ſhee that turneth aſide to the flockes of thy companions?Now therfore, that I am ſome little ſtarted aſide from thee, O thou whom my ſoule notwithſtanding dearely loueth, ſhew me, I beſeech thee, where, and in what wholeſome &amp; diuine paſtures thou (like a good ſhepherd) feedeſt, &amp; reſteſt thy flockes with comfortable refreſhings, in the extreamity of theſe hot perſecutiōs: for, how can it ſtand with thy glory, that I ſhould through thy neglect, thus ſuſpiciouſly wander vp and downe, amongſt the congregations of them that both

command &amp; practiſe the worſhip of falſe gods.
                     
                     
                        CHRIST, to the Church.
                     
                        IF thou know not,
                              7. If thou know not, O thou the faireſt among women, get thee foorth by the ſteps of the flocke: &amp; feed thy Kids aboue the tents of the ſhepherds. ô thou my Church, whō I both eſteeme and haue made moſt beutifull by my merits, and thy ſanctification: ſtray not amongſt theſe falſe worſhippers, but follow the holy ſteps of thoſe bleſſed Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles, which haue bin my true &amp; ancient flocke; who haue both knowen my voice, &amp; followed me: &amp; feed thou my weake &amp; tender ones with this their ſpirituall food of life; far aboue the carnall reach of thoſe other falſe teachers.
                        
                           
                           
                              8. I haue cō
                              pared thee, O my Loue, to the troups of horſes in the chariots of Pharaoh.Such is mine eſtimation of thee, O my Loue, that ſo farre as the choiſeſt Egyptian horſes of Pharaoh, for comely ſhape, for honourable ſeruice, for ſtrength and ſpeed, exceed all other, ſo farre thou excelleſt all that may be compared with thee.
                        
                           
                              9. Thy cheeks are comely with rowes of ſtones, &amp; thy necke with chaines.Thoſe parts of thee, which both are the ſeats of beauty, and moſt conſpicuous to the eye, are gloriouſly adorned with the graces of my ſanctification; which are for their worth as ſo many precious borders of the goodlieſt ſtones, or chaines of pearle.
                        
                           
                              10. We will make thee borders of gold, with ſtuds of ſiluerAnd tho thou be already thus ſet forth: yet I and my father

haue purpoſed a further ornament vnto thee, in the more plentifull effuſion of our ſpirit vpon thee: which ſhalbe to thy former deckings, in ſtead of pure gold curiouſly wrought with ſpecks of ſiluer.
                     
                     
                        The Church.
                        BEhold (O yee daughters) euen now,
                              11. While the king was at his repaſt, my ſpiknard gaue the ſmell thereof. whiles my Lord and King ſeemes farre diſtant from me, &amp; ſits in the throne of heauen amongſt the companies of Angels (who attend around vpon him) yet now doe I find him preſent with mee in ſpirit; euen now, the ſweet influence of his graces, like to ſome precious ointmēt, ſpreds

it ſelfe ouer my ſoule; and returnes a pleaſant fauour into his owne noſthrils.
                        
                           
                              12. My welbeloued is as a bundle of myrrhe vnto me, lying betweene my breaſts.And tho I bee thus delightful to my Sauiour, yet nothing ſo much as he is vnto me: for loe, as ſome fragrant pomander of myrrhe, laid betweene the breſts, ſends vp a moſt cō

                              13. My welbeloued is as a cluſter of Cypers vnto me among the vines of Engeddy.Or if any thing can bee of more excellent vertue, ſuch ſmell as the cluſters of cypersberries, within the fruitfulſt, pleaſantſt, &amp; richeſt vineyards, &amp; gardēs of Iudaea, yeeld vnto the paſſengers; ſuch and more

delectable doe I finde the ſauour of his grace to me.
                     
                     
                        CHRIST.
                        NEither doeſt thou on my part loſe any of thy loue,
                              14. My Loue behold thou art faire, thine eyes are like the doues O my deare Church: for, behold; in mine eies, thus clothed as thou art with my righteouſneſſe, oh how faire &amp; glorious thou art; how aboue all compariſon glorious and faire! thine eies (which are thy ſeers, Prophets, Apoſtles, Miniſters) and thoſe inward eyes, whereby thou ſeeſt him that is inuiſible, are full of grace, chaſtity, ſimplicitie.
                     
                     
                        
                        The Church.
                        
                           
                              15. My wel-beloued, behold, thou art faire &amp; pleaſant: alſo our bed is greene.NAy then (O my ſweet ſauiour and ſpouſe) thou alone art that faire and pleaſant one indeed, from whoſe fulneſſe I confeſſe to haue receiued al this little meaſure of my ſpiritual beauty: and behold, from this our mutuall delight, &amp; heauenly coniunctiō, there ariſeth a plentifull and floriſhing increaſe of thy faithfull ones, in all places, &amp; through all times.
                        
                           
                              16. The beames of our houſe are cedars, our galleries are of firre.And behold, the congregations of Saints, the places where we do ſweetly conuerſe and walke together, are both firme and during (like cedars

amongſt the trees) not ſubiect through thy protecting grace to vtter corruptiō; &amp; through thy fauourable acceptation and word (like to galleries of ſweet wood) full of pleaſure and contentment.
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. II.
                     
                        Chriſt.
                        THou haſt not without iuſt cauſe magnified mee,
                              1. I am the Roſe of the field, and the Lillie of the valleyes. O my Church: for, as the faireſt &amp; ſweeteſt of all floures which the earth yeeldeth, the roſe &amp; lilly of the valleyes, excell for beautie, for pleaſure, for vſe, the moſt baſe and odious weeds that growe; ſo doth my

grace, to al them that haue felt the ſweetneſſe thereof, ſurpaſſe all worldly contentments.
                        
                           
                              2. Like a lilly among the thorns, ſo is my Loue among the daughters.Neither is this my dignitie alone: but thou O my ſpouſe (that thou mayeſt bee a fit match for mee) art thus excellent aboue the world, that no lilly can bee more in goodly ſhew beyond the naked thorn, then thou in thy glory thou receiueſt from me, ouer-lookeſt all the aſſemblies of aliens and vnregenerates.
                     
                     
                        The Church.
                        
                           
                              3. Like the Apple-tree among the trees of the foreſt, ſo is my wel-beloued among the ſonnes of men: vnder his ſhadow had I delight, &amp; ſate down; and his fruit was ſweet vnto my mouth.ANd (to returne thine owne praiſes) as ſome fruitful &amp; wel-growen Apple-tree,

in compariſon of all the barren trees of the wild foreſt: ſo art thou (O my beloued ſauiour) to me, in compariſon of all men, and angels; vnder thy comfortable ſhadowe alone, haue I euer wont to find ſafe ſhelter againſt all mine afflictions, all my tentations and infirmities, againſt all the curſes of the Law, and dangers of iudgement, and to coole my ſelfe after all the ſcorching beames of thy fathers diſpleaſure, and (beſides) to feed and ſatisfie my ſoule with the ſoueraigne fruite of thy holy word; vnto eternall life.
                        Hee hath gratiouſly led me by his ſpirit,
                              4. He broght me into the wine cellar, and loue was his banner ouer me. into the midſt of

the myſteries of godlineſs; and hath plentifully broached vnto me the ſweet wines of his Scriptures, &amp; ſacrament. And looke how ſoldiers are drawn by their colours, from place to place, and cleaue faſt to their enſigne: ſo his loue, which he ſpred forth in my hart, was my only bāner, wherby I was both drawen to him, directed by him, and faſtened vpon him.
                        
                           
                              5. Stay me with flagons, and comfort me with apples: for, I am ſicke of loue.And now, O ye faithfull Euangeliſts, Apoſtles, Teachers apply vnto me, with all care &amp; diligence, all the cordiall promiſes of the Goſpel: theſe are the full flagons of that ſpirituall wine, which only can cheere vp my ſoule; theſe are the

apples of that tree of life, in the middeſt of the garden, which can feed me to immortalitie. Oh come and apply theſe vnto my heart: for, I am euen ouercome with a longing expectation and deſire of my delayed glory.
                        And whileſt I am thus ſpiritually languiſhing in this agony of deſire;
                              6. His left hand be vnder my head: and let his right hand imbrace mee. let my Sauiour imploy both his hands to releeue mine infirmitie: let him comfort my head &amp; my heart, my iudgement and affections (which both complaine of weakeneſſe) with the liuely heate of his gratious imbracements: and ſo let vs ſweetly reſt together.
                        
                           
                           
                              7. I charge you O daughters of Ieruſalem, by the roes &amp; by the Hinds of the field, that ye ſtirre not vp, nor waken my Loue, vntill he pleaſe.In the meane time, I charge you (O all yee that profeſſe any friendſhip or affinitie with mee) I charge you, by whatſoeuer is comely, deare, and pleaſant vnto you, as you will auoid my vttermoſt cenſures, take heed how you vexe and diſquiet my mercifull Sauior, &amp; greeue his ſpirit, and wrong his name, with your vaine and leud cōuerſatiō; &amp; do not dare by the leaſt prouocation of your ſin to interrupt his peace
                        
                           
                              8. It is the voice of my wel-beloued: behold he cō
                              meth leaping by mountains and skipping by the hils.Loe, I haue no ſooner called, but hee heares and anſweres me with his louing voice: neither doth he only ſpeak to me afar, but hee comes to me with much willingnes &amp; celeritie;

ſo willingly, that no humane reſiſtaunce can hinder him, neither the hillocks of my leſſer infirmities, nor the mountaines of my groſſer ſinnes (once repented of) can ſtaie his merciful paſe towards me.
                        So ſwiftly, that no Roe,
                              9. My Welbeloued is like a Roe, or a yoūg Hart: loe, hee ſtandeth behinde our wall, looking forth of the windowes, ſhewing himſelfe through the grates. or Hinde, can fully reſemble him in this his ſpeed &amp; nimbleneſs: and loe, euen now, before I can ſpeak it, is he come neere vnto me; cloſe to the doore and wall of my heart. And tho this wall of my fleſh hinder my full fruition of him: yet loe, I ſee him by the eye of faith, looking vpon me; I ſee him as in a glaſſe; I ſee him ſhining gloriouſly, through the

grates and vvindowes of his Word and Sacraments, vpon my ſoule.
                        
                           
                              10. My VVelbeloued ſpake, &amp; ſayd vnto me, ariſe my Loue, my faire one, and come thy wayAnd now, mee thinkes, I heare him ſpeake to mee in a gracious invitation &amp; ſay, Ariſe (O my Church) riſe vp, whether from thy ſecurity, or feare: hide not thy head anie longer, O my beautiful Spouſe for danger of thine enemies: neither ſuffer thy ſelfe to bee preſſed with the dulneſs of thy nature, or the careleſſe ſleepe of thy ſinnes; but come forth into the comfortable light of my preſence, and ſhew thy ſelf cheerefull in me.
                        
                           
                              11. For, behold winter is paſt, the rain is changed and gone way.For beholde, all the cloudie winter of thy afflictions is paſſed,

all the tempeſts of tentations are blowen ouer; the Heauen is cleare, and novv there is nothing that may not giue thee cauſe of delight.
                        Euerie thing novv reſembles the face of a ſpirituall Spring;
                              12. The flowers appeare in the earth: the time of the ſinging of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land. all the ſweete flovvers and bloſſomes of holy profeſſion put forth, and ſhewe themſelues in their opportunities: now is the time of that heauenly melodie, which the cheerefull Saints and Angells make in mine eares; vvhile they ſing ſongs of deliuerance and praiſe me with their Alleluiahs and ſay, Glory to God on hie, in earth peace, goodwill towards men.
                        
                           
                           
                              13. The fig-tree hath broght forth her young figs and the vines with their ſmall grapes haue caſt a ſauor: ariſe my Loue, my fa

                              14. My Doue, thou art in the hoales of the rocke, in the ſecret places of the cliftes: ſhewe mee thy ſight, let mee heare thy voice: for thy voice is ſweet and thy ſight comely.O my beautifull, pure, and chaſte ſpouſe, which like vnto ſome ſolitary doue haſt long hid thine head in the ſecret &amp; inacceſſible clifts of the rocks, out of the reache and knowledge

of thy perſecutours; how-euer thou art concealed from others, ſhew thy ſelfe in thy works and righteouſneſſe, vnto me: and let me be euer plied with thy words of imploration, and thankeſgiuing: for thy voice (tho it be in mourning) and thy face (tho it bee ſad and blubbered) are exceedingly pleaſing vnto me.
                        And in the meane time (O all yee that wiſhe vvell to my Name and Church) do your vtmoſt indeauour,
                              14. Take vs the foxes, the litle foxes which deſtroy the vines: for our vines haue ſmall grapes. to deliuer her from her ſecret enemies (not ſparing the leaſt) who either by hereticall doctrine, or profane conuerſation, hinder the courſe of the Goſpell; and

peruert the faith of many; eſpecially of thoſe, that haue newly giuen vp their names to me, and are but newly entred into the profeſſion of godlineſſe.
                        
                           
                              16. My VVelbeloued is mine, &amp; I am his: hee feedeth amōg the Lillies.My beloued Sauior is mine, through my faith; and I am his through his loue: and we both are one, by vertue of that bleſſed vnion on both partes; whereby wee mutually inioy each other, with all ſufficient contentment. And how worthily is my loue placed vpon him, who leadeth mee forth into pleaſant paſtures; and at whoſe right hand there is the fulneſſe of ioy for euermore?
                        
                           Come therefore (O my Sauiour) and vntill the day of thy glorious appearance ſhall ſhine forth to the world,

                              taines of Bether. wherin our ſpirituall marriage ſhall be conſummate, and vntill all theſe ſhadowes of ignorance, of infidelity, of troubles of conſcience, and of outwarde tribulations be vtterly diſperſed, and chaſed away; come and turne thee to me againe: thou which to the carnall eyes of the world ſeemeſt abſent; come quickly and delay not: but, for the ſpeed of thy return be like vnto ſom ſwift Roe, or Hind, vpō thoſe ſmooth hills of Gilead, which Iordan ſeuers from the other part of Iury.

                              1. In my bed, by night I ſought him that my ſoule loued: I ſoght him, but I found him not.MY ſecuritie told me that my Sauior was neer vnto my ſoule, yea with it, and in it: but vvhen by ſerious and ſilent meditation I ſearched my owne heart, I found that (for ought my ovvne ſenſe could diſcerne) hee was farre off from me.
                        
                           
                              2. I will riſe therefore now, and goe about in the Citie by the ſtreetes, and by open places, and will ſeek him that my ſoule loueth: I ſoght him, but I found him not.Then thought I vvith my ſelfe, Shall I lie ſtill contented with this want? No, I wil ſtirre vp my ſelfe: and the helpe I cannot finde in my ſelfe, I will ſeeke in others; Of all that haue been experienced in all kinde of difficulties: of all

deep Philoſophers, of the wiſeſt and honeſteſt worldlings, I will diligently enquire for my Sauiour: amongeſt them I ſought him, yet could receiue no anſvvere to my ſatisfaction.
                        Miſſing him there,
                              3, The watchmen that went about the City, found me: to whom I ſayd, haue you ſeen him whom my ſoule loueth? I ran to thoſe vviſe and carefull Teachers, whom God hath ſet, as ſo many watch-men vpon the walles of his Ieruſalem, vvho ſooner found me then I could aske after them; to whome I ſayde, (as thinking no man coulde bee ignoraunt of my loue) Can you giue mee no direction where I might finde him, vvhome my ſoule loueth?
                        
                           
                           
                              4. VVhen I had past a little from them, then I found him whō my ſoule loueth: I took holde on him, and left him not, till I had brought him vnto my mothers houſe into the chā
                              ber of hir that conceiued me.Of whome when I had almoſt left hoping for comfort, that gracious Sauiour vvho would not ſuffer mee tempted aboue my meaſure, preſented himſelfe to my ſoule: Loe then, by a newe act of faith, I laide faſt holde vpon him, and will not let him anie more part from my ioyfull embracements; vntil both I haue brought him home fully into the ſeate of my conſcience, and haue won him to a perpetuall cohabitation with mee; and a full accompliſhment of my loue, in that Ieruſalem which is aboue, which is the mother of vs all.

                              5. I charg ye ô daughters of Ieruſalem, by the roes, &amp; by the Hinds of the fielde, that yee ſtirre not vp nor wakē my loue vntill ſhee pleaſe. all the Night long of my ſeeming abſence, toyled in ſeeking mee, I charge you (O all that profeſſe anie friendſhip with mee) I charge you by whatſoeuer is comly, deare, and pleaſant vnto you, that (as you will anſwere it) you trouble not her peace vvith anie vniuſt or vnſeaſonable ſuggeſtions, vvith vncharitable contentions, with anie Nouelties of doctrine; but ſuffer her to reſt ſweetelie, in that diuine truthe,

vvhich ſhee hath receiued, and this true apprehenſion of mee vvherein ſhee reioyceth.
                        
                           
                              6. Who is ſhe that commeth vp out of the wilderneſs, like pillars of ſmoke perfumed with myrrh and incenſe, &amp; with al the chief ſpices?Oh who is this, how admirable? hovv louely? vvho but my Church, that aſcendeth thus gloriouſlie out of the vvilderneſſe of the world, vvherein ſhee hath thus long vvandered, into the bleſſed manſions of my fathers houſe; all perfumed vvith the graces of perfect ſanctification, mounting right vpward into her glorie, like ſome ſtraight pillar of ſmoake, that ariſeth from the moſt rich and pleaſant compoſition of odours that can be deuiſed.

Behold his bed better then Salomons: threeſcore ſtrong men are roūd about it, of the valiant men of Iſrael. and loe how glorious is this place where I ſhall eternally inioy the preſence and loue of my Sauiour; hovv farre doth it exceede the earthlie magnificence of SALOMON: about his bedde doe attende a guard of threeſcore choyſeſt men of Iſrael.
                        All ſtout VVarriers,

anie ſuddaine daunger: but about this heauenlie pauilion of my Sauiour, attend millions of Angelles, ſpirituall Souldiers, mightie in power, readie to bee commaunded ſeruice by him.
                        
                           
                              9. King Salomon made himſelf a bed of the trees of Lebanon.The Bride-bed that SALOMON made (ſo much admired of the World) vvas but of the Cedars of Lebanon.
                        
                           
                              10. Hee made the pillars therof of ſiluer, and the ſted thereof of gold, the hangings thereof of purple, whoſe midſt was in-layde with the loue of the daughters of Ieruſalem.The Pillars but of ſiluer, and the bed-ſteed of golde; the Teſter or Canopie but of purple; the couerlet wrought vvith the curious and painefull needle-worke of the maydes of IERVSALEM: but this celeſtiall reſting place of

my GOD is not made with hands, not of anie corruptible metall, but is full of incomprehenſible light, ſhining euermore vvith the glorious preſence of GOD.
                        And as the outward ſtate,
                              11. Come forth yee daughters of Sion, and beholde the King Salomon with the crowne wherwith his mother crowned him in the day of his mariage, and in the day of the gladneſſe of his heart. ſo the maieſty of his perſon is aboue all compariſon. Come forth (O ye daughters of Sion) lay aſide all priuate and earthly affections, looke vpon king SALOMON as hee ſits ſolemnlie crovvned in the daie of his greateſt royaltie and triumph, and compare his higheſt pompe vvith the diuine magnificence of my Sauiour; in that daie vvhen his bleſſed

                              1. Behold, thou art faire my Loue, beholde thou art faire, thine eyes are like the doues within thy locks, thine haire is like a flocke of goats which looke downe from the mountaines of Gilead.OH how faire thou art and comely, my deer Spouſe; how inwardely faire with the giftes of my Spirit; how faire outwardly in thy comely adminiſtration, and gouernmēt: thy ſpirituall eyes of vnderſtanding, and iudgement, are

full of puritie, chaſtitie, ſimplicitie; not wantonly caſt forth, but modeſtly ſhining amidſt thy locks: all thy gratious profeſſion and all thy appendances, and ornaments of expedient ceremonies, are ſo comely to behold, as it is to ſee a flock of well-ſed goates graſing vpon the fruitfull hils of Gilead.
                        Thoſe that chew and prepare the heauenly food for thy ſoule,
                              2. Thy teeth are like a flock of ſheepe in good order which goe vp from the waſhing: which euery one bring out twinnes, and none is barren among them. are both of gratious ſimplicitie, and of ſweete accordance one with another; hauing all one heart, and one tongue: and both themſelues are ſanctified, &amp; purged from their vncleanneſſes, and are fruitfull in their holy labours

vnto others; ſo that their doctrine is neuer in vaine, but is ſtill anſwered with plentifull increaſe of ſoules added to the Church.
                        
                           
                              3. Thy lips are like a thred of ſcarlet, and thy talke is comely; thy temples are within thy locke as a peece of a pomgranate.Thy ſpeech (eſpecially in the mouth of thy teachers) is both gratious in it ſelfe, and ſuch as adminiſters grace to the hearers; full of zeale and feruent charitie, full of grauitie and diſcretion: and that part of thy countenance, which thou wilt haue ſeene (tho dimly and ſparingly) is full of holy modeſty and baſhfulneſſe; ſo bluſhing, that it ſeemeth like the colour of a broken peece of pomgranate.
                        
                           Thoſe,
                              4. Thy necke is as the towre of Dauid, built for defence: a thouſand ſhields hang therein, &amp; all the targets of the ſtrong men. who by their holy authority ſuſtaine thy gouernment (which are as ſome ſtraight and ſtrong neck to beare vp the head) are like vnto Dauids hie tower of defence, furniſhed with a rich armory; which affords infinite wayes of ſafe protection, and infinite monumēts of victory.
                        Thy two teſtaments (which are thy two ful &amp; faire breaſts whereby thou nurſeſt all thy faithfull children) are as two twinnes of Kiddes: twinnes,
                              5. Thy two breſts are as two yong Kids that are twins, feeding among the Lillies. for their excellent and perfect agreement, one with another, in all reſemblances: of Kiddes, that are daintily fed among the ſweete flowers,

for the pleaſant nouriſhment, which they yeeld to all that ſucke thereof.
                        
                           
                              6. Vntill the day breake and the ſhadowes fly away, I will go into the moū
                              taine of myrrh, and to the mountain of incenſe.Vntill the day of my gratious appearance ſhall ſhine foorth, and vntill all theſe ſhadowes of ignorance, infidelitie, afflictions, be vtterly and ſuddenly diſperſed, O my ſpouſe, I will retire my ſelfe (in regard of my bodily preſence) into my delightfull and glorious reſt of heauen.
                        
                           
                              7. Thou art all farre my loue, &amp; there is no ſpot in thee.Thou art exceeding beautifull, O my Church, in all the parts of thee: for, all thy ſinnes are done away, and thine iniquitie is couered, and loe I preſent thee to my father without ſpot, or wrinkle, or

any ſuch deformitie.
                        And now,
                              8. Come with me from Lebanon, my ſpouſe, euen with me from Lebanon, and looke from the top of Amanah, from the toppe of Shenir and Hermon, frō the dens of the Lyons, &amp; frō the mountaines of the Leopards. (O thou which I profeſſe to haue married to my ſelfe in trueth and righteouſneſſe) thou ſhalt be gathered to me from all parts of the world: not onely from the confines of Iudea, where I planted and found thee, but from the remoteſt and moſt ſauage places of the nations; out of the company of infidels, of cruell &amp; bloody perſecutors, who like Lyons and Leopards haue tyrannized ouer thee, &amp; mercileſſely torn thee in pieces.
                        Thou haſt vtterly rauiſht me from my ſelfe (O my ſiſter and ſpouſe; for ſo thou art,
                              9. My ſiſter my ſpouſe, thou haſt

both ioyned to me in that ſpirituall vnion, and coheire with mee of the ſame inheritance, and glory) thou haſt quite rauiſht my heart with thy loue: euen one caſt of one of thine eyes of faith; and one of the ornaments of thy ſanctification where with thou art decked by my ſpirit, haue thus ſtricken mee with loue: how much more, when I ſhall haue a full ſight of thee, and all thy graces, ſhall I bee affected towards thee.
                        
                           
                              10. My ſiſter, my ſpouſe; how faire is thy loue; how much better is thy loue thē wine, and the ſauour of thine ointments then all ſpices?O how excellent, how precious, howe delectable are thoſe loues of thine, O my ſiſter, my ſpouſe; how farre ſurpaſsing all earthlie

delicates; and the ſauour of thoſe diuine vertues, wherwith thou art indued, more pleaſing to my ſent, then all the perfumes in the world.
                        The gratious ſpeeches that proceede from thee,
                              11. Thy lippes, my ſpouſe, drop as honycombs: honie and milke are vnder thy tongue, &amp; the ſauour of thy garments is as the ſauour of Lebanon. are as ſo many droppes of the honie-combe that fall from thy lippes: and whether thou exhort, or confeſſe, or pray, or comfort, thy words are both ſweete and nouriſhing; and the ſauour of thy good workes, and outward conuerſation, is to mee as the ſmell of the woode of Lebanon to the ſenſe of man.
                        
                           
                           
                              12. My ſiſter my ſpouſe, is as a garden incloſed, as a ſpring ſhut vp, &amp; a fountaine ſealed vp.My ſiſter, my ſpouſe, is as a garden or orchard full of all varietie of the heauenly trees, &amp; flowers of grace; not lying careleſly open, either to the loue of ſtrāgers, or to the rage of enemies, which like the wild Bore out of the wood, might root vp, &amp; deſtroy her choiſe plants: but ſafely hedged and walled about, by my protection, and reſerued for my delight alone; ſhe is a ſpring and Well of wholeſome waters, from whom flowe foorth the pure ſtreames of my word; but, both incloſed and ſealed vp: partly, that ſhee may the better (by this cloſeneſſe) preſerue her owne naturall taſte;

and vigor, from the corruptions of the world; and partly, that ſhe may not be defiled &amp; mudded by the profane feete of the wicked.
                        Thou art an orchard,
                              13. Thy plants are as an orchard of pomegranats with ſweete fruits: as Cipers, Spikenard, euen Spikenard &amp; Saffron, Calamus and Cinamō, with all the trees of Incenſe, Mirrh &amp; Aloes with all the chief ſpices. yea a paradiſe, whoſe plants (which are thy faithfull children that grow vp in thee) are as pomgranate trees; the apples whereof are eſteemed, for the largeneſſe, colour and taſte, aboue all other: or (if I would feede my other ſenſes) the plentifull fruites of thy holie obedience (which thou yieldeſt vnto mee) are for their ſmell as ſome compoſition of Cipreſſe, Spikenard, Saffron, ſweete Cane, Cinamon, Incenſe,

Myrrhe, Aloes, and whatſoeuer elſe may bee deuiſed, vnto the moſt perfect ſent.
                        
                           
                              14. O fountaine of the gardens, O well of liuing waters &amp; the ſprings of Lebanon.Thou art ſo a ſpring in my garden, that the ſtreames which are deriued from thee, water all the gardens of my particular congregations, all the world ouer: thou art that fountaine, from whoſe pure head iſſue all thoſe liuing waters, which who-ſo drinketh, ſhall neuer thirſt againe; euen ſuch cleare currents, as flow from the hill of Libanus, which like vnto another Iordan, water all the Iſrael of God.

                        IF I be a garden,
                              15. Ariſe O North, &amp; come O South, and blowe on my garden, that the ſpices thereof may flow out: let my wel-beloued come to his garden, and eate his pleaſant fruit as thou ſaiſt (O my Sauiour) then ariſe, O all ye Souerain winds of the ſpirit of God, and breath vpon this garden of my ſoule; that the ſweet odours of theſe my plants, may both be increaſed, and may alſo bee diſperſed afarre, and carried into the noſthrils of my wel-beloued: &amp; ſo let him come into this his owne garden (which his owne hand hath digged, planted, watered) and accept of the fruit of that ſeruice &amp; prayſe, which hee ſhall inable mee to bring forth to his name.

I am come into my garden, my ſiſter, my Spouſe: I gathered my myrrh with my ſpice; I eate my hony with my hony comb, I drank my wine with my milk: eate O my friends drinke, and make you merry O welbeloued.BEholde, according to thy deſire, I am come into my gardē, O my ſiſter, my ſpouſe; I haue receiued thoſe fruites of thine obedience which thou offereſt vnto mee, with much ioy: and pleaſure. I haue accepted not onely of thy good workes, but thy indeauours &amp; purpoſes of holineſſe: both which are as pleaſant to mee, as the honie and the honie combe. I haue allovved of the cheerefulneſſe of thy ſeruice, and the wholeſomneſſe

And ye, O my friends, whether bleſſed Angells, or faithfull men, partake with mee in this ioie ariſing from the faithfulneſſe of my Church: cheere vp and fill your ſelues, O my beloued, with the ſame ſpirituall dainties vvherevvith I am refreſhed.
                     
                     
                        The Church.
                        WHen the world had caſt mee into a ſecure ſleep,
                              2. I ſleepe, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my VVelbeloued that knocketh, ſaying, open vnto me my ſister, my Loue, my doue, my vndefiled: for mine head is full of dew, &amp; my locks with the drops of the night. or ſlumber rather (for my hart was not vtterly bereaued of a true faith, in my Sauiour) euen in this darkeneſſe of my minde, it pleaſed my gracious Redeemer not to neglect

mee; hee came to mee, and knocked oft, and called importunately at the doore of my heart, by his word and chaſtiſements, and ſaid; Open the doore of thy Soule, O my ſiſter, my deare, chaſte, comely, vnſpotted Church: let me come in, &amp; lodge &amp; dwell with thee, in my graces; ſhut out the world, and receiue me with a more liuely act, and renouation of thy faith. For loe, I haue long waited paciently for this effect of thy loue, and haue indured all the iniuries both of the night, and weather of thy prouocations, that I might at laſt inioy thee.
                        
                           I anſwered him again,
                              3. I haue put off my coat: how ſhal I put it on? I haue waſhed my feet: how ſhall I defile them. pleading excuſes for my delay; Alas Lord, I haue now, ſince I left my forward profeſſion of thee, auoyded a great number of cares and ſorrowes: muſt I take them vp againe to follow thee? I haue liued cleane from the ſoile of theſe euils: and ſhall I now thruſt my ſelfe into daunger of them?
                        When my Sauiour heard this vnkind anſwere of delay:
                              4. My wel-beloued put his hand from the hole of the doore; &amp; my bowels yearned toward him. hee let his hand fall from the key-hole, which he had thus before without ſucceſſe labored about; &amp; withdrew himſelf from ſoliciting mee any more: whereupon my hart &amp; bowels

yearned within mee for him, and for the remorſe of my ſo long foreſlowing his admittance vnto me.
                        
                           
                              5. I roſe vp to open to my wel-beloued, and my hands did drop down myrrhe, and my fingers pure myrrhe vpon the handles of the barres.And now I rouzed vp my drouſy hart (what I could) that I might in ſome cheerefull manner deſire to receiue ſo gratious a Sauior: which when I but indeauoured, I found that hee had left behind him ſuch a plentifull bleſſing (as the monument of his late preſence) vpon the firſt motions of my heart, as that with the very touch of them I was both exceedingly refreſhed, and mooued to further indignation at my ſelfe for delaying him.
                        
                           I opened to my beloued Sauiour:
                              6. I opened to my Welbeloued: but my Welbeloued was gone and paſt; mine hart was gone when hee did ſpeak: I ſoght him but I could not find him; I called him, but hee anſwered mee not. but my Sauiour had now (in my feeling) withdrawen himſelfe, &amp; hid his countenance from me, holding me ſhort of thoſe gracious offers, and meanes which I had refuſed; and now I was almoſt paſt my ſelfe with deſpaire, to remember that ſweete inuitation of his, which I neglected: I ſought him therefore in my thoughts, in the outward vſe of his ordinances, and of my earneſt praiers; but he would not as yet be found of me, or let mee finde that I was heard of him.
                        Thoſe which ſhould haue regarded me,
                              7. The watch-men that went about the City found mee, they ſmote me and wounded me: the watch men of the walls tooke away my vaile from me. and by their vigilancy

haue ſecured me from danger, proued mine aduerſaries: inſtead of comforting mee, they fell vpon mee, and wounded mee with their falſe doctrines, drawing me on into further errours, ſpoyling mee of that puritie and ſinceritie of profeſſion, vvherewith as with ſome rich &amp; modeſt vaile I was formerly adorned, and couered.
                        
                           
                              8. I charge you ô daughters of Ieruſalem, if you finde my wel-beloued, that you tell him I am ſicke of loue.I aduiſe you ſolemnely, O all ye that wiſh well to me (for I care not who knowes the vehemencie of my paſſion) if you ſhall finde my Sauiours preſence in your ſelues before me, praie for the recouerie of his loue to mee; and bemone

my eſtate to him, tel him how I languiſh with the impatient deſire of his loue, &amp; preſence to be reſtored vnto me.
                        O thou which art the moſt happie, moſt gracious,
                              9. O the faireſt among women, what is thy welbeloued, more thē another wel-beloued? what is thy welbeloued, more then another louer, that thou doſt ſo charge vs? &amp; moſt glorious of all creatures, the choſen of the liuing God; what is thy welbeloued whom thou ſeekeſt, aboue al other the ſons of men? what ſuch eminency is there in him aboue all ſaints and angells: that thou art both ſo far gone in affectiō to him; and doeſt ſo vehemently adiure vs to ſpeake vnto him for thee?
                              10. My welbeloued is white &amp; ruddy, the ſtanderdbearer of ten thouſand.
                        
                        My welbeloued (if you know not) is of perfect beautie; in vvhoſe face is an exact mixture

of the colours of the pureſt &amp; healthfulleſt complexion of holineſſe: for, he hath not receiued the ſpirit by meaſure; and in him the god-head dwells bodily; he is infinitely fairer, then all the ſonnes of men; &amp; for goodlineſs of perſon may beare the ſtandard of comelineſſe and grace amōgſt tenne thouſand.
                        
                           
                              11. His head is as fine gold, his locks curled, and black as a rauen.The deitie which dwelleth in him, is moſt pure and glorious: and that fulneſſe of grace which is communicated to his humane nature is wondrouſly beautifull, and ſo ſets it forth, as the black curled lockes doe a freſh and welfauoured countenance.
                        
                           His iudgement of al things,
                              12. His eies are like doues vpon the riuers of waters, which are waſht with milke, and remaine in their fulneſſe. and his reſpect to his Church (which are as his eyes) are full of loue, and full of pittie, ſhining like vnto doues waſhed in water, yea in milke, ſo as there is no ſpot, or blemiſh to bee found in them: and they are withall ſo fully placed; as is both moſt comely and moſt expedient for the perfect ſight of the eſtate, and neceſſities of his ſeruants.
                        The manifeſtation of himſelfe to vs in his word,
                              13. His cheeks are as a bed of ſpices and as ſweete flowers, and his lips like lillies dropping downe pure myrrhe. is ſweet to our ſpirituall feeling, as an heape of ſpice, or thoſe flowers that are vſed to make the beſt perfuming oyntmēts are to the other ſenſes: his heauenly

inſtructions and promiſes of his Goſpel are vnſpeakably comfortable, and plentious, in the grace that is wroght by them.
                        
                           
                              14. His hands as rings of gold ſet with the chriſolit; his belly like white Iuory couered with ſaphirs.His actions, and his inſtruments (which are his hands) are ſet forth with much port &amp; maieſtie, as ſome precious ſtone beautifies the ring wherin▪ it is ſet: the ſecret counſells of his breaſt, and the myſteries of his wil are moſt pure and holy, and full of excellent glory.
                        
                           
                              15. His legs are as pillars of marble, ſet vppon ſockets of fine golde: his countenance as Lebanon, excellent as the Cedars.All his proceedings are firm and ſtable; and withall, as pillars of marble ſet in ſockets of tryed golde; ſo as they are neither ſubiect to vvauering,

nor to anie danger of infirmitie and corruption: the ſhewe and carriage of his whole perſon whereby he makes himſelf knowen to his choſen, is exceeding goodly, &amp; vpright like to the ſtreight and lofty Cedars of Lebanon.
                        His mouth out of which,
                              16 His mouth is as ſweet things, &amp; he is wholy delectable: this is my welbeloued, and this is my louer, O daughters of Ieruſalem. proceedeth innumerable bleſſings &amp; cōfortable promiſes, is to my ſoule euen ſweetneſſe it ſelfe; yea (what ſpeak I of anie one part?) as you haue heard in theſe particulars, hee is as ſweets: there is nothing but comfort in him; and there is no comfort but in him; and this (if ye would know) is my welbeloued; of ſo incomparable

                        MY Welbeloued Sauiour (if you vvould knowe this alſo) is to bee ſought and found in the particular aſſemblies of his people,
                              1. My welbeloued is gone down in to his garden to the beds of ſpices, to feed in the gardens and to gather lillies. which are his garden of pleaſure, wherin are varieties of all the beds of renued ſoules, which both he hath planted, and dreſſed by his continuall care, and wherin hee walketh for his delight; feeding and ſolacing himſelfe vvith thoſe fruites of righteouſneſſe, and new obedience, which they are able to bring forth vnto him.
                        And now loe,
                              2. I am

                              y welbeloueds, and my welbeloued is mine, who feedeth amōg the Lillies. whatſoeuer

hath happened croſs to me, in my ſenſible fruition of him; in ſpight of al tentations, my beloved Sauior is mine through faith; and I am his through his loue; and both of vs are by an inſeparable vnion knit together; vvhoſe coniunction and loue is moſt ſweete, and happy for, all that are his, he feedeth continually with heauenly repaſt.
                     
                     
                        CHRIST.
                        
                           
                              3. Thou art beautifull my Loue as Tirzah, comly as Ieruſalē, terrible as an army with banners.NOtwithſtanding this thy late blemiſh of neglecting me, O my Church: yet ſtil in mine eies, throgh my grace; vpon this thy repētance, thou art beautifull, like vnto that

neate and elegante Citie of 
                              •
                           irzah, and that orderly building of Ieruſalem, the glorie of the world: and with this thy louelineſſe, thou art awefull vnto thine aduerſaries, throgh the power of thy cenſures, and the maieſtie of him that dwelleth in thee.
                        Yea, ſuch beautie is in thee,
                              4. Turne away thine eyes from me, for they ouercom me: thine haire is like a flocke of goats which looke downe from Gilead. that I am ouercome with the vehemencie of my affection to thee: turne away thine eies a while from beholding mee; for, the ſtrength of that faith, whereby they are fixed vpon me, rauiſhes me from my ſelfe vvith ioy. I doe therefore again renew thy former praiſe; that thy gracious profeſſion,

and all thy appendances &amp; ornamēts of expedient ceremonies, are ſo comely to behold, as it is to ſee a flock of wel-fed goates graſing vpon the fruitfull hills of Gilead.
                        
                           
                              5. Thy teeth are like a flock of ſheep which goe vp from the waſhing, which euery one bring out twins, and none is barren among them.Thy Teachers, that chew &amp; prepare the heauenly foode for thy ſoule, are of ſweet accordance one vvith another, hauing all one heart, and one tongue; and both themſelues are ſanctified &amp; purged from their vncleanneſſes, and are fruitfull in their holy labours vnto others: ſo that their doctrine is neuer in vaine, but is ſtill aunſvvered vvith plentifull increaſe of ſoules to the Church.
                        
                           That part of thy countenaunce which thou wilt haue ſeene (tho dimmely and ſparingly) is full of holy modeſtie and baſhfulneſſe;
                              6. Thy Temples are within thy lockes as a peece of a Pomgranate. ſo bluſhing, that it ſeemeth like the colour of a broaken peece of Pomgranate.
                        Let there be neuer ſo great a number of people and nations of Churches and aſſemblyes,
                              7. There are threeſcore queenes, and foureſcore concubines, and of the dā
                              ſels, without number. vvhich challenge my name and loue, and perhaps by their outwarde proſperitie may ſeeme to plead much intereſt in mee, and much worth in themſelues:
                        Yet thou onely art alone my true and chaſte Spouſe,
                              8. But my Loue is alone, and my vndefiled, ſhee is the onely daughter of hir mother, &amp; ſhe is deare to her that bare hir: the daughters haue ſeen hir, and coū
                              ted hir bleſſed, euen the queenes and the cōcubines and they haue praiſed hir. pure and vndefiled in the

truth of thy doctrine, and the imputation of my holineſſe; thou art ſhee, whome that Ieruſalem vvhich is aboue, (the mother of vs all) acknovvledgeth for her only true, and deare daughter. And this is not my commendation alone, but all thoſe forraine aſſemblyes, vvhich might ſeeme to bee riualles vvith thee of this prayſe, doe applaude and bleſſe thee in this thine eſtate, and ſaie; Bleſſed is this people, whoſe God is the Lord.
                        
                           
                              9. Who is ſhee that looketh forth as the morning, faire as the moone, pure as the ſunne, terrible as an armie with banners.And admiring thy goodlineſſe ſhall ſay; Who is this that lookes out ſo freſhlie as the morning nevve riſen; which

from theſe vveake beginnings is grovven to ſuch hie perfection, that nowe ſhee is as bright, and glorious, as the ſunne in his full ſtrength; and the moone in a cleare skie; and vvithall is ſo dreadefull thorough the maieſtie of her countenance, and povver of her cenſures, as ſome terrible armie, vvith enſignes diſplayed, is to a vveake aduerſarie.
                        Thou complayneſt of my abſence, (O my Church):
                              10. I went downe to the dreſſed Orchard, to ſee the fruits of the vally, to ſee if the vine budded, and if the Pomgranates flouriſhed. there vvas no cauſe; I meant not to forſake thee: I did but onelie vvalke dovvne into the vvell-dreſſed Orcharde of thine aſſemblyes, to

recreate and ioy my ſelfe, with the viewe of their forvvardneſſe: to ſee the happie progreſſe of the humble in ſpirit, and the gracious beginnings of thoſe tender ſoules, vvhich are newly conuerted vnto mee.
                        
                           
                              11. I knew nothing, my ſoule ſet mee as the charets of my noble people.So earneſtly did I long to reuiſit thee, and to reſtore comfort vnto thee; that I haſted I knevve not vvhich vvaie: and vvith inſenſible ſpeede, I am come backe, as it were vppon the ſwifteſt chariots, or the vvinges of the vvinde.
                        
                           
                              12. Return, return, ô Shulamite: returne, return, that I may behold thee: what ſhall you ſee in the Shulamite, but as the company of an army?Now therefore returne (O my Spouſe, the true daughter of Ieruſalem) returne to mee,

returne to thy ſelfe and to thy former feeling of my grace: returne, that both my ſelfe, &amp; all the company of Angels, may ſee, and reioyce in thee: and what ſhall ye ſee (O all ye hoaſt of heauen) what ſhall ye ſee in my Church? euen ſuch an awfull grace and maieſtie, as is in a wel-marſhalled armie, ready to meet with the enemy.

                        HOw beautiful are thy feet O daughter of the hyeſt;
                              1. How beautifull are thy goings with ſhooes, O princes daughter? the compaſſe of thy hyps like iewels: the worke of the hand of a cunning workeman. being ſhod with the preparation of the Goſpell of peace,

and readily addreſſed to run the way of the commaundements of thy God: thou art compaſſed about thy loynes with the girdle of verity; which is both precious for the matter of it, and cunningly framed by the skill of the ſpirit of truth.
                        
                           
                              2. Thy nauell is as a round cup, that wanteth not liquor: thy bellie is as an heap of wheat compaſſed about with Lillies.The nauell, whereby all thy ſpirituall conceptions receiue their nouriſhment, is full of all fruitfull ſupplie, and neuer wants meanes of ſuſtenance, to feed them in thy wombe: which alſo is ſo plentious in thy bleſſed increaſe, that it is as an heape of wheat, conſiſiſting of infinite pure grayns which conſort together with

much ſweetneſſe, and pleaſure.
                        Thy two teſtaments (which are thy two full and comely breaſts;
                              3. Thy two breaſts are as two yong Kids that are twins. by whoſe wholeſome milke thou nouriſheſt all thy faithfull children, once borne into the light) are for their excellēt &amp; perfect agreement, &amp; their amiable proportion, like two twins of Kids.
                        Thoſe,
                              4. Thy necke is like a tower of Iuory: thine eies are like artificiall pooles in a frequented gate: thy noſe is as the tower of Lebanon, that looketh toward Damaſcus. who by their holy authority ſupport thy gouernmēt (which are as ſom ſtraight and ſtrong necke to beare vp thy head) are for their height and defence like a tower; for their order, pureneſſe, and dignitie, like a tower of Iuory: thy teachers and miniſters

(which are thine eyes) are like vnto ſome cleare and artificiall ponds of water, in a place of greateſt reſort: wherein all commers may ſee the faces of their conſciences; &amp; whence they may plentifully draw the waters of life. Thy noſe, by which all ſpirituall ſents are conuaied to thee, is perfectly compoſed, and featured like ſome curious turret of that goodly houſe in Lebanon; ſo as thy iudgement, and power of diſcerning the ſpirits, is admirable for the order and excellency thereof.
                        
                           
                              5. Thine head vpō thee is as ſcarlet, and the buſh of thine head like purple: the king is tied in thy beames.The whole tyre of thine head (which are the ceremonies vſed by thee) are very

gracefull, and of hie eſtimation and price to all the beholders: and as for me, I am ſo enamoured of thee, that I am euen tyed by my owne deſire, to a perpetuall preſence in thine holy aſſemblies.
                        Oh how beautifull &amp; louely art thou therefore (O my Church) in all thy parts and ornaments?
                              6. How faire art thou &amp; how pleaſant art thou, O my loue, in pleaſures? how ſweete and pleaſant art thou (O my loue) in whatſoeuer might giue me true contentment?
                        Thy whole frame is,
                              7. This thy ſtature is like a palme-tree, and thy breaſts like cluſters. for goodlineſs &amp; ſtreight growth, like vnto ſome tall palme-tree; which the more it is depreſſed by the violence of perſecutions, riſeth the more; and

the two breaſts of thy Teſtaments are like two full iuicie cluſters, which yeeld cōfortable and abundant refreſhing.
                        
                           
                              8. I ſaid, I will goe vp into the Palme-tree. I will take hold of her boughes: thy breaſts ſhall now be like the cluſters of the vines, and the ſauour of thy noſe like apples.Seeing then thou art my Palme-tree, I haue reſolued in my ſelfe to adioyne my ſelfe to thee; to inioy thee, to gather thoſe ſweet fruits of thy graces, which thou yeeldeſt; and by my preſence alſo will cauſe thee to bee more plentifull in all good works, and doctrine; ſo as thou ſhalt afford abundance of heauenly liquor vnto all the thirſtie ſoules of thy children; and an acceptable verdure of holineſſe and obedience vnto me.
                        
                           
                              4. And the roofe of thy mouth like good wine, which goeth ſtraight vp to my welbeloued; &amp; cauſeth the lips of him that is aſleepe, to ſpeake.And the deliuerie of my

word, by the mouthes of thy miniſters, ſhall bee as ſome excellent wine, which ſparkleth right vpward: being wel accepted of that God, in whoſe name it is taught, and looketh moſt pleaſantly in the glaſſe, being no leſs highly eſteemed of the receiuers: which is of ſuch wō
                           derfull power, that it is able to put words both of repentance, and praiſe into the lips of him, that lies aſleepe in his ſinnes.
                     
                     
                        The Church.
                        BEhold, ſuch as I am,
                              11. I am my welbeloueds, and his deſire is toward mee. I am not my owne; much leſſe am I any others: I am wholely my Sauiours; and now I ſee, and feele, whatſoeuer I had

deſerued, that he is mine alſo, in all intire affection; who hath both choſen me, and giuen himſelfe for me.
                        
                           
                              11. Come my wel-beloued, let vs goe into the fields let vs lodge in the villages.Come therefore, O my deare Sauiour, let vs ioyne together in our naturall care: let thy ſpirit and my ſeruice be intent vpon thy congregations here below on earth; and let vs ſtay in the place where our ſpirituall husbandry lieth.
                        
                           
                              12. Let vs goe vp earely in the morning to the vines, and ſee if the vine floriſh, whether it hath diſcloſed the firſt grapes, or whether the pomegranats bloſſom: therewill I giue thee my loue.Let vs with all haſt &amp; cheerfulneſſe viſit the fruitfull vines of our beleeuing children; &amp; to our mutuall comfort, bee witneſſes and partakers of all the ſignes and fruits of grace, of all thoſe good workes, and thankeſgiuings, of thoſe holy

indeauours and worthy practiſes, which they yeeld forth vnto vs: let vs iudge of their forwardneſſe, and commend it: whereupon it will eaſily appeare, that the conſummation of our happie marriage draweth neere, in which there ſhall bee a perfect vnion betwixt vs.
                        Behold: thy godly ſeruants,
                              13. The mandrakes haue giuen a ſmell, and in our gates are all ſweete things, new and old; my welbeloued, I haue kept thē for thee. which not onely beare fruit themſelues, but are powerfull in the prouocation of others, preſent their beſt ſeruices vnto thee; and euen at our doores (not farre to ſeeke, not hard to procure) is offer made vnto thee, of all varietie of fruite; whether

from thy yong conuerts▪ or thy more ſettled profeſſors: &amp; all theſe I ſpend not lauiſhlie; but, in my louing care, duely reſerue them for thee, and for the ſolemne day of our full marriage.

                        The Iewiſh Church.
                        
                           
                              1. Oh that thou wereſt as my brother that ſucked the breaſt of my mother. I would finde thee without, I would kiſſe thee, then they ſhould not deſpiſe mee.OH that I might ſee thee (my Sauiour) clothed in fleſh: Oh that thou which art my euerlaſting husband, mighteſt alſo be my brother, in partaking the ſame humane nature with me; that ſo I finding thee below vpon earth,

might familiarly intertaine thee, and conuerſe with thee, without the reproach of the world; yea, might be exalted in thy glory.
                        Then would I (tho I be now pent vp in the limits of Iudea) bring thee forth into the light,
                              2. I will lead thee, and bring thee into my mothers houſe; there thou ſhalt teach me: I will cauſe thee to drinke ſpiced wine, &amp; new wine of the pomgranats. and knowledge of the vniuerſall Church, whoſe daughter I am: and then and there, thou ſhouldeſt teach me how perfectly to ſerue &amp; worſhip thee, &amp; I ſhall gladly intertaine thee with a royall feaſt of the beſt graces that are in my holieſt ſeruants; which I knowe thou wilt account better cheere, thē all the ſpiced cups, and pomgranate wines in the world.
                        
                           
                           
                              3. His left hand ſhall bee vnder my head, and his right hand ſhall imbrace mee.Then ſhall I attaine to a neerer communion with him; and both his hands ſhall bee imployed to ſuſteine, and relieue me: yea, he ſhall comfort my head and my heart (my iudgement, and affections) with the liuely heat of his gracious imbracements.
                        
                           
                              4. I charge you O daughters of Ieruſalem, that you ſtirre not vp, nor waken my loue, vntill hee pleaſe.I charge you (O all ye that profeſſe any friendſhip to me) I charge yee deepely, as yee will auoyd my vttermoſt cenſures; take heed how ye vexe and diſquiet my mercifull Sauiour, and grieue his ſpirit: and doe not dare, by the leaſt prouocation of him, to interrupt his peace.
                     
                     
                        
                        CHRIST.
                        WHo is this,
                              5. VVho is this that cō
                              meth out of the wilderneſſe; leaning vpon her welbeloued? I raiſed thee vp vnder an apple-tree: there thy mother conceiued thee: there ſhe conceiued that bare thee. that from the comfortleſs deſertes of ignorance, of infidelity, of tribulatiōs, aſcendeth thus vp into the glorious light &amp; libertie of my choſen? relying her ſelfe wholly vpon her Sauiour, and ſolacing her ſelfe in him? Is it not my Church? it is ſhe, whom I haue loued, &amp; acknowledged of olde: for, euen vnder the 
                              •
                           ree of offence, the forbidden fruit which thou taſtedſt to thy deſtruction, I rayſed thee vp againe from death; Euen there, thy firſt mother conceiued thee; while by faith ſhee layd hold on

that bleſſed promiſe of the Goſpel, whereby ſhe, and her beleeuing ſeed were reſtored.
                     
                     
                        Iewiſh Church.
                        
                           
                              6. Set mee is a ſeale on thy hart, and as a ſignet on thine arme: for loue is ſtrong as leath; Ielouſie is cruell as the Graue: the coales thereof are ſiery coales, and a vehement flame.ANd ſo haue thou me ſtill (O my Sauiour) in a perpetual and deare remēbrance: keepe me ſure in thine heart, yea in thine armes, as that which thou holdeſt moſt precious; and let me neuer be remoued from thy loue; the leaſt ſhew and danger whereof I cannot indure: for, this my ſpirituall loue is exceeding powerfull, and can no more be reſiſted then death it ſelfe: &amp; the ielous zeale which I haue for thee, and thy glory, conſumes

me, euen like the Graue, and burnes mee vp like vnto the coales of ſome moſt vehemēt and extreame fire.
                        Yea, more then any fire;
                              7. Much water cannot quench loue, neither can the floudes drowne it: if a man ſhould giue all the ſubſtance of his houſe for loue, they would greatly contemne it. for any flame yet may be quenched with water: but al the water of afflictions &amp; terrors (yea whole ſtreams of perſecutiōs) cānot quench this loue: &amp; for all tempting offers of wealth, of pleaſures &amp; honor, how eaſily are they all contemned for the loue of my Sauiour?
                        We haue yet a ſiſter (as thou knoweſt O Sauiour) ordained through thy mercy to the ſame grace with me:
                              8. VVe haue a little ſiſter, and ſhe hath no breasts: what ſhall we doe for our ſiſter, when ſhe ſhall be ſpoken for? the vncalled Church of the Gentiles; ſmall (as yet) of groth, through

the rareneſs of her conuerts, &amp; deſtitute of the helpe of any outward miniſtery; whereby ſhe might either bear, or nouriſh children vnto thee: when ſhe growes vnto her maturitie; and the myſtery of calling her vniuerſally to thee, ſhall be reuealed to the world, and her ſelfe; what courſe will it pleaſe thee to take with her?
                     
                     
                        CHRIST.
                        
                           
                              9. If ſhe be twall, we will build vpon her a ſiluer palace: and if ſhe be a doore, we will keepe her in with boards of cedar.IF ſhee ſhall continue firme and conſtant, in the expectation of her promiſes, and the profeſſion of that truth which ſhall bee reuealed; wee will beautifie and ſtrengthen her, with further grace, and make

her a pure and coſtly palace, fit to entertaine my ſpirit: and if ſhe will giue free paſſage &amp; good entrance, to my word and grace; wee will make hir ſure and ſafe from corruption, and reſerue hir to immortalitie.

I am a wall, and my breaſts are as towers: then was I in his eyes as one that findeth peace. that condition vvhich thou requireſt in the Church of the Gentiles, thou findeſt in me; I am thus firme and conſtant in my expectation, in my profeſſion: and that vvant thou findeſt in her of abilitie to nouriſh her Children, by the breaſt of thy WORDE, is

not in mee; who haue abundance both of nouriſhment &amp; defence: vpon which my cō
                           feſſion and plea, I found grace and peace in the eyes of my Sauiour; and receiued from him aſſurance of his euerlaſting loue to me.

                              11. Salomon had a vine in Baalhamon: hee gaue the vineyard vnto keepers: euery one bringeth for the fruite thereof a thouſand peeces of ſiluer.MY Church is my Vine, &amp; I am the owner, and huſbandman: our thrift and profit therof farre exceedeth the good husbandry of Salomon: he hath a rich vineyard indeed in a moſt fruitfull ſoyle; but he lets it forth to the hands of others, as not beeing able to keepe and dreſſe it himſelfe:

and therefore he is faine to be content with the greateſt part of the increaſe, not expecting the whole.
                        But my vine is euer before me,
                              12. But my vineyard which is mine is before mee: to thee ô Salomon appertaineth a thouſand peeces of ſiluer, and two hundreth to them that kept the fruit thereof. I am with it to the end of the world, I reſerue it in mine owne hands, and dreſſe it with mine owne labour: and therfore if thou (O Salomon) canſt receiue from thine, to the proportion of a thouſand, thy workemen and farmers vvill looke for the fift part to come vnto their ſhare; wheras the gaine of my vineyard ariſeth wholly, and onely, vnto my ſelfe.
                        Sith therefore ſuch is my care of thee,
                              13. O thou that dwelleſt in the gardēs, the companions hearken vnto thy voice, cauſe me to heare it. and ioy in thee

(O my Church; which cōſiſteſt of the particular aſſemblies of men profeſſing my name) ſee thou be diligent in declaring my will, &amp; giuing holy counſelles to all thy fellow-members: ſpeake forth my prayſe in the great congregations, (which al attend willingly vpon thee) and let me heare the voice of thy conſtant &amp; faithfull confeſſion of mee before the world.

                              14. Oh my welbeloued, flee away, and be like vnto the Roe, or to the yong Hart vpon the mountaines of ſpices.I Will moſt gladly doe what thou commaundeſt, O my Sauiour but, that I may performe it accordingly; be thou

(which art, according to thy bodily preſence, in the hyeſt heauens) euer preſent with me by thy ſpirit, &amp; haſten thy glorious comming, to my full redemption.
