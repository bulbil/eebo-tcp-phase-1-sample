            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

Among all the inexplicable blessings which we are now by the goodnesse of God to inioy by your Maiesty, there is one amongst the rest so full of blessednesse, as that it ouerreacheth the measure of common comprehension to dilate it in speech: And what is that? Euen the knitting togither of your two Kingdomes England and Scotland, which are now so closed in one Harmony as well of Religion, as of their confining borders and agreeing languages, as that (according to the saying of the Prophet) Bone is ioyned to Bone, &amp; Ioynt to Ioynt: Most gracious king, our most beloued Soueraigne, there is one thing that your Maiesty may hold as an vndoubted certainty: namely this, that you are entred into your rule and raigne ouer Englād, with as great cōformity of harts of English subiects as euer King or Queene within this Realme. Long may your Highnesse liue: Long may the Scepter sway in your Princely hands: And vnto the King of Kings we bow the knees of our hearts, that he will vouchsafe to graunt vnto your Maiesty a long, a peaceable, and renowmed Raigne ouer vs.
            I will not take vpon me to particularize vnto your Maiestie the Nature of Englands gouernement, but generally (vnder your Princely fauour) this thereof may be sayd that by the most ancient vsage of England, the king hath bin accounted to be persona mixta, hoc est, vnita cum Sacerdotibus, aunswerable to that of Homer and Aristotle: Suprema potestas antiquitus fuit regia &amp; Sacerdotalis. And for that that is holden thereof ciuilly at this day, it is this: we say that our supreme power is principatus tam regalis quam politicus, the one respecting times of warre, and the other times of peace.

               GOOD Sir, my occasions staying me so long in London this last vacation, as that according to the bill of Certificat there died aboue 19 hundreth of the Plague in one weeke: Although I then thought it not fit to imploy that time in any serious Study, yet I was vn

Whereupon resorting to a few odde trifles which I had penned about a yeare or two sithens, I added euery day for diuerse dayes together sundry others vnto them. And causing my man to write them out after me, in the end I found the whole thereof to arise vnto a proportion of a litle Booke: which (thus written as it is) I send vnto you, as a token of my assured goodwill, being ready from time to time to expresse the same by better meanes as I shall be enabled thereunto. And whereas in one or two places of the booke I haue made mention of outragious fees, let that light where it will: As for you, you are knowne to be a giuer of fees: But an extreame exacter of fees I am perswaded in my heart you neuer were, nor euer will be. And so with my best wishing vnto you, I cease: This First of Ianuarie 16

E. Hake.
            
         
         
            
            The Authors Prologue to such of his Poems in this booke as concerne Golds Kingdome.
            
               ALthough that Gold can closely creepe
               where th'aire could neuer come,
               And cause that vice and vertue be
               of equall poise with some,
               Yet noble and true gentle minds
               with Gold will not be won,
               To do the thing that is vniust
               or leaue good things vndone.
               A proofe hereof me selfe haue seene
               in one that noble is,
               And holdeth place of high respect
               as he well worthy is:
               A poore man with Petition
               annexed to his case
               To him repaires, not hauing helpe
               of any friend in place:
               Which when he had exhibited,
               although that noble man
               Had great imployments of the State
               yet marke what followd than:
               Not full two dayes expyrd, before
               the poore man did receaue
               An Answer to his full content,
               And thence did take his leaue,
               Not rendring gifts to any one
               nor Secretaries fees,
               But hasting home vnto his Hiue,
               reioyced with his Bees.
               A yeare thence after, troubles came
               about that passed gift,
               As that some sought to frustrate it
               by friends or fained shift.
               The poore man for his helpe againe
               preferreth his complaint,
               And by his onely writing doth
               that Lord therewith acquaint,
               Himselfe vnable through disease
               in person to be seene.
               
                  
This noble man, as if the case
               had then like present bene,
               What he had passed earst before,
               Confirmes with greater force:
               Right noble surely was this deed
               and full of true remorse.
               Yea, as before, no peny went
               out of the poore mans purse,
               So now againe, no peny he
               to any did disburse.
               Patron to pupils is that Lord,
               (so doth his office lie)
               Amongst whose vertuous deedes this one,
               the poore mans case did try.
               And sith that I an Actor was
               to pen that poore mans case,
               I therefore write it as a note
               of vertue in that place.
               The rather, for because this Age
               vnhelping is, and why?
               Few men will helpe in cases where
               they see no profit lie.
               So that to speake what I conceiue,
               I feare, no Gold, no Good,
               No, not perhaps for such as haue
               aduentured their bloud.
               And for the man at home, who hath
               of good deseruing bene,
               Nor workes nor worth can him aduance
               if Gold come not betweene:
               For now, as good to beate the ayre
               as fill the eares of some
               Who Sutes preferre: Nay, fill their hands,
               else looke to find them Mum.
               
               Yet write I not with mind to touch
               men of superiour place:
               Nor do I know particulers
               that any should deface.
               Many complaine and many cry:
               God knoweth where the fault doth lie.

                  COnfirme Religion as the Arke of God:
               Preserue the places where the same shall rest:
               Then lawes for life, and maners as the Rod,
               Wherewith offence of Sinne must be supprest,
               So shall the land assuredly be blest.
               But firie Spirits are not for that charge,
               Nor such as seeke their profits to enlarge.
            
            
               Next, for the Common-wealth (as is begun)
               Take off oppressions from the Subiects backe,
               And to the Commons do not alwayes runne
               For euery thing that Common-wealth doth lacke,
               For so poore Subiects still shall go to wracke,
               And yet must Subiects Caesars duties pay:
               No faithfull Subiect will thereof say nay.
            
            
               As for the Lawyers faults and griefes thereby,
               The peoples plaints suffice to make them knowne,
               And how huge monstrous fees on Suters lye,

               In briefe, the sores and sicknesses that are
               In Englands state, which grieued men will shew
               In Parliament, will moue the Princes care
               To finde the fountaines whence the same doe flow,
               And fountaines found, to purge them all arow.
               The God of heauen preserue our blessed King,
               That he to Church and Realme true peace may bring.

               IT is recorded in this wise:
               At Wormes aGermaine Towne,
               When all the Princes there were met
               And all were sitten downe

            A notable example of integrity in a King, betweene himselfe and his Subiects.

swayed most therein: And oftentimes when hee found their Sentence to be with him, he would pronounce the contrary, and would bitterly chide those who had attributed too much to his side.
         
         
            Another notable example of integritie in a Prince.
            
            
               FRedericke Duke of Saxony had certaine woods 10. Manlius de Magistratu pag. 592. neare adioyning vnto Wittenberg, which had bene sometimes purchased by his progenitors. Anhaldine mother of those Princes of that name, who then liued (being wise &amp; a good Oeconomist) required those woods to be restored vnto her, because they had bene at the first but mortgaged. The Duke although it was very hard for him to depart with the woods, insomuch as he had rather haue giuen more mony for them, then to haue forgone them (in respect that the price of woods did then daily increase) yet he would by no meanes vexe or disquiet that most honest Matron, or hold her long in suspence: And therefore albeit he had counsell &amp; pretextes propounded vnto him, how by a shew of right he might retaine them, yet he would by no meanes burthen his conscience, by admitting of any of the sayd pretextes for the retaining of them: and such was his integrity, as that he willingly restored the same to the house of the Anhaldi

            A Case of Difficultie in the Royall Administration.
            
               
                  GReat Difficultie may be found in this
               Vnto the Prince, where Subiects doe complaine
               Of any that in office doth amisse,
               As that percase he should some wrong maintaine:
               For as the Prince is bound to aide the right,
               Without respect of any Subiects might,
            
            
               So, meete it is that where he giueth power,
               He should support the same, and still vphold

               Th'vprightest men, and men of purest molde

               Then what to write, or speake in such a case,

               Declared vnto him that now

               If Fortune were not in the fault:
               Choose here (sayd he) of two,
               A chist of gold, or one of stones,
               And thinke well what to do,
            
            
               For I'le be hence forth quite of blame,
               (The fault thou sayst is mine)
               And if thou choose the stones, then say
               The fault is rather thine,
            
            
               Or if not thine, yet Fortunes fault:
               And who can that redresse?
               The Courtier chose, and chose the stones:
               (Alas, vnluckinesse.)
            
            
               But shall I say my mind herein?
               Good Kings will haue respect,
               Whom they aduance, whom they reward,
               And whom they do reiect.
            
            
               For why? All's one to raise the ill,
               And not to helpe the honest still.
            
         
         
            Three things very grieuous to good mindes.
            
               THree things there are that breed much griefe,
               And discontent of mind:
               The worlds mishaps, vntrust of friends,
               The third, that Gold doth bind,
            
            
               
               Nay binde and loose, though not with all,
               yet greatly with the most:
               And for the first of these three things,
               what man on earth can boast
            
            
               That he hath past his dayes in peace,
               not crost with worlds missehap?
               Not one I thinke, though best men most
               doe taste of sorrowes sap.
            
            
               The King hath cares to crosse his ioyes,
               home strises to crosse his peace,
               And traytrous harts conspire his hurts,
               while Subiects loues increase.
            
            
               If pleasures for his health he take,
               what interruptions are
               Vnto his pleasures and disportes
               by suites, that breede his care
            
            
               In causes of his Subiects states,
               perhaps their liues and lands:
               The strong doth still oppresse the weake,
               the help's in Princes hands.
            
            
               Yea day by day occasions rise
               of common wealthes redresse,
               And day by day abuses grow,
               which Princes should suppresse.
            
            
               And yet if Princes should not haue
               their pleasures and delight.
               
                  
Alas, alas, what were their case?
               of all men worst in sight:
            
            
               Onely the King that feareth God,
               and seekes to spread his prayse
               Shall haue his seat and State securde,
               his soule shall see good daies.
            
            
               Then if the King in this worlds course,
               where all men him obay,
               Findes worlds vnrest, of lower States
               how firme can be the stay?
            
            
               Next for the faith and trust of friends,
               where is the friend whose faith
               As well in hard as happy state
               in friendship firmly stayth?

               retaines in friendships band,
               And Winters woes driue cleane away:
               So doth mens friendship stand.
            
            
               Examples here of infinite
               the world doth dayly show,
               And how mens loues are wrongly plac'd
               and from wrong causes grow:
            
            
               For were true vertue their loues cause,
               then what could it remoue?
               No, no, tis gaine, or vaine respect,

               The rich holds friendship with the rich,

               And pot companions with their mates

               Though nere so small, and yet perhaps
               the matter full of toyle,
               Vnlesse with gifts thou get thee friends,
               be sure to catch the foyle:

               There is a fellow calde Giffe Gaffe,
               
               that in such cases gripes.
            
            
               And so we see that Gold and gifts
               In suites must doe the deede,
               And how that no man for desert
               of any thing can speede.

               And many things of good respect
               are oft bestowd on such.
            
            
               
               Againe, we see that some there are,
               who willingly are led
               By men of slender gifts: And why?
               because by them are fed
            
            
               The humors whereunto they be
               enclined, and most what
               For that they please them with delights,
               and seruile are to that.
            
            
               And sooner will they giue to those,
               Then vnto men of price.
               If such one aske, he straight way speedes,
               and hath it with a trice.
            
            
               But if I should runne ouer all
               that might be said in this,
               How Gold hath Soueraigne power in sutes,
               and chiefe effecter is
            
            
               Of mens desires, and that desert
               (as of it selfe) shall fayle,
               I might imploy much speech therein,
               And little should preuaile:
            
            
               For howsoeuer men of place
               and honour are enclinde
               To further and promote a man
               that is of honest mind,
            
            
               Yet are the meanes so difficult
               that must be made to such,
               
                  
And fauorites so many that

               As that a man farre better were

               And so I end my dolefull song
               of threefold griefe and paine,
               As worlds vnrest, next, friends vntrust,
               the third, that all's for gaine.
            
         
         
            Of true Nobilitie.
            
               OF true Nobilitie doe we enquire?
               Tis that that doth excell the common sort
               In vertuous Actes whereto it doth aspire,
               And shewes it selfe abroad with noble port:
               For noble port must shew the noble State,
               It fits not Noble minds to be at common rate.
            
            
               But what for that? doth Noble therefore wrong?
               Doth he oppresse or seeke a common hurt,
               Whereby to raise himselfe or make him strong?
               No fye, the Noble reckons that as durt:
               For as the world is cheered by the Sunne,
               So from true Noble comforts dailyrunne.
            
            
               Doth Countries seruice call the Noble forth?
               Most what he is prepared for the same,
               For that's a meane to shew his noble worth:
               
                  
And that accomplisht wins him noble fame.
               To God, to King, and Countrey is he chargde
               To see the Honour of them all enlargde.
            
            
               Is noble neere the King? who else should be?
               Then nobly doth he seruice to his Grace,
               As both his honour and his safety to foresee,
               For which his eyes are open in each place,
               Detracting none that are of good desart,
               But helping all out of a noble hart:
            
            
               And chiefly vnto suters doth he show
               A noble affabilitie, and why?
               Because from Prince, as from a spring doth flow
               The Subiects helpe, which helples else might lye:
               Then if this Noble keepe poore suters backe,
               Vnnobly doth he cause poore suters wracke,
            
            
               And to proceede, doth he in Countrey dwell?
               No partie factions doth he there support,
               Much lesse, prepareth plots how to rebell,
               Nor graceth any of suspected sort.
               But honours law, and Iudges doth assist,
               And makes not law to serue him as he list.
            
         
         
            To the most reuerend and right Honourable, the Primate of all England.
            
               TRue Paterne of pietie, with true hearts good will
               My pen doth presume to speake of thy grace
               
                  
Whose vertues and goodnesse right well do fulfill
               The honour and greatnesse that is in thy place,
               Gladnesse of conscience may thee imbrace,
               Whose zeale hath beene peacefull with censures discreet,
               Whose life hath beene blamelesse with doctrine to meete.
            
            
               Pride sitting below thee in enuious chayre,
               Doth swell at thy greatnesse, yet faine would be great:
               And Momus the wretch that all would impaire,
               His head about mischiefe and malice doth beate,
               But care of the truth shall stablish thy seate.
               Thus vertuesregard hath imployed my pen,
               Not Monies reward, nor pleasing of men.
            
         
         
            The Iudge must be truthes Patron.
            
               THe Iudge that sitteth on the bench
               to iudge of wrong and right,
               Should haue the high Tribunall seate
               prefigur'd in his sight,
            
            
               Least that the Lawyer with his skill
               and argument preparde
               Well sounding to the sense of man,
               and subtilly declarde
            
            
               Should haue the hap to harbour in
               his well entending brest,
               Where nought but truth, and truthes defence
               for euermore should rest.
            
            
               
               For this is sure, that some there are
               in this our learned age,
               Whose force is great with witto win
               the iudgement of the sage:
            
            
               Then ought this rule be alwayes held
               in all iudiciall things,
               That neither Arte, nor lawes dispute
               which learned Lawyer brings,

               in question of the law:
               For sudden iudgements of tentimes
               may from the truth withdraw.
            
            
               And (Lord) how grieuous were the case,

               Without well ripping vp the same
               with due and deepe regard,
               Foreseeing that the Princes case
               in iudgement be not sparde?
            
            
               As (for the purpose) were it thus:
               A Statute law there is
               Of Chauntries (so entituled)
               whereon the case be this:
            
            
               A man giues lands to one by Will,
               he finding euermore

               of some deceast before,
            
            
               And paying for that Obites charge
               a certaine yerely summe,
               And for default thereof a paine
               out of those lands to come.
            
            
               Admitting also that the lands
               of greater valew ar,
               Besides Reprises of the same
               then th'Obites charges far,
            
            
               Then say those lands are claymed for
               the King in this degree,
               As that the vse thereof by lawe

               affyrme how it should go,
               Yet this I say, that if such case
               should into question gro,

               Must needes be great to dignifie the man,
               To whom it pleaseth God such gifts to lend,
               Though but one gift: If so, what say we the

               Where sundry gifts of equall great degree
               In one selfe person well conioyned be?
            
            
               Lawes knowledge of it selfe withouten more
               Hath made some great, yet not without desart.
               And hath it so? what say we then to store
               Of Lawes great skill, and depth of learned Art?
               I say that he in whom such gifts are

                  ound,
               Is great by Right vpon true Reasons ground:
               Such one are you: O still, then still abound in righteousnesse.
            
         
         
            
            Of the most commendable and honourable gouernement of the City of London, in the late times of the sicknesse and decease of the most gracious and renowned Queene Elizabeth.
            
               FEare, horror, trembling, and dismay of heart
               Were each where seene vpon reports that went
               That our late Queene lay sicke. O dreadfull smart
               Redoubled still as new reports were sent.
               Most men to flit and chaunge their soiles were bent,
               But where to seate or where to be secure,
               Alas, alas, no casting could procure.
            
            
               The vpland man, thought safest in the Towne,
               The townes man thought him best that was at large,
               And he that earst sate warme in long furd gowne,
               Could well haue brook
                     •
                   the steering of a barge,
               Not one of other then would take the charge,
               But each suspecting other, all dismayd,
               Not for defence, but for destruction stayd.
            
            
               O London then (to thy still lasting same)
               So prudently thy Gouernement was set,
               As that how euer newes then went and came,
               Nought could thy graue foresight or compasse let
               Wisedome and courage so in thee were met,
               As that the Peacefull had his quiet rest,
               And few men fe
                     •
                  rd that they should be opprest.
            
            
               
               No troupes by day nor lurkings in the night
               Could gather head, but streight they were descryde:
               Each officer so held his course aright,
               As that no doubtfull person durst abide.
               And for the care that was at water-side,
               It was to all great ioy to vnderstand
               What rules were there for setting men on land.
            
            
               In fine, when certainty of death was knowne
               Of her our Queene, did hurly burly rise?
               No none at all: A bud then straight way blowne
               On selfe same Stalke did London well suffice
               To measure all things with an vpright Size.
               The keyes were kept for him who did succeed,
               And nought was heard that discrepance might breed.
            
            
               Then I as one partaker of that Good,
               Who with my wife and family did stay
               Within the City where I vnderstood
               Th'occurrents of those times and Cities sway,
               Found cause of sweete content whereas I lay,
               Obseruing there the orders of that place,
               Which with my heart I highly did imbrace.
            
         
         
            No gold no goodnesse.
            
               O Gold that goest in and out,
               That rul'st and raignest at thy will,
               O thou that bringest things about,
               Why art thou absent from vs still?
               But O our God, O where art thou
               That suffrest Gold to conquer now?
            
            
               
               You earthly men who vnto men
               Nought giue where you can nothing take,
               I speake to you, regard me then,
               Your Gold and Goods your God you make:
               For whereas Gold is, you are won,
               But where Gold is not, you haue done.
            
            
               Be honest, learned, skilfull, wise,
               Be what thou canst, if Gold thou want,
               Thou maist lie still, thou shalt not rise,
               For nothing proues where Gold is skant:
               For Gold it is that doth the dead,
               But nothing prospers where is need.
            
            
               What, shall I then lie downe and die?
               Alas I cannot when I would:
               Or shall I sit me downe and crie
               And with my teares my griefe vnfold?
               Lament and crie, do what thou wilt,
               Thy cause is lost for lacke of Gilt.
            
            
               Yet say I not that all men looke
               To be rewarded for their deed:
               But this I say, that few men brooke
               To helpe a man that is in need:
               For though he write with Homers i

            The same of this vnhelpping Age.
            
               WHere is the man on whom thou mayst depend
               To worke thy good or to assist thee so,

               My selfe haue had the proofe with men of choise,
               Who wisht me euer well, but all in voyce:
            
            
               For when it came to proofe, to write or speake
               In matters which themselues thought good and right,
               Good Lord, how were those friends of mine growne weake
               And how small ioy tooke they of me the sight?
               If twere a matter for me to endite,
               I could report hereof a tedious Tale
               And yet the morall might be worth the sale:
            
            
               But this (in somme) I say and make it knowne,
               That if my case require more helpe then view,
               Except I giue, or can, I looke for none:
               For if thou stand vpon desert, Adieu:
               Marke well my speech, for thou shalt find it true,
               This age affoordeth naught but words and wind,
               The rich shall be preferd, The poore shall stay behind.
            
         
         
            
            The same complaining of his want of friends.
            
               VVAking in my bed I wept

               All these are but the loome
               That warpeth vp my death,
               All these presage my doome,
               The losse of later breath.
               But is there not a Ioy
               That worldly Ioy excels,
               That helpeth all annoy
               And worldly woe expels?
               There is no doubt, God graunt it me
               So shall those woes extinguisht be.

               You are the men, the men whose losse of blood
               With wounds and skars doth still on you appeare
               Though cloth'd and couer'd with your best aray:
               But is that all? no, this besides I heare
               That what remaines of life or lim, you say,
               You are content to spend it any way
               At Princes pleasure, speake he but the word.
               Ah good sweet harts, what more can breath afford?

               Prest for the field, and to forsake the Towne,
               If new imployments call you forth againe.

            A Memoriall of the worthy and Right Worshipfull Gentleman, Richard Louelace, late of Hurley, in the County of Berke, Esquire, Liefetenant of the Castle and Forrest of Windsor.
            
               Some liue, who neuer louing were
               to kisse nor yet to kin,
               But Louelace he by louing all
               vnlouing hearts did win.
            
            
               I speake of that that I well know,
               who knew him to his end:
               His Countrey did not beare a man
               more louing to his friend.
            
            
               What, to his friend? yea poore as rich
               according to his powre
               His Towne of Hurley, where he dwelt
               affirmes it to this houre.
            
            
               His Towne of Hurley where he colde
               endure the poore to dwell.
               What dwell? yea oftentimes rent-free
               the Countrey knowes it well.
            
            
               And more then that, for hauing woods
               and wastes that spacious were,
               He could abide the poorer sort
               to plant them dwelling there:
            
            
               
               Not for enlarging of his rentes
               (a thing farre from his mind)
               And yet vnto those Cotagers
               be land ofttimes assignde.
            
            
               And as vnto his friends and poore
               he thus exprest his loue,
               So for his seruants, wife, nor childe
               could him from them remoue:
            
            
               For when his Copy-holds came voyd
               he strake not vp the drum,
               Nor gaue them to his children, as
               I know is vs'd by sum.
            
            
               But as they fell into his hands,
               he gaue them to his men:
               My selfe haue made them Copies oft,
               was he not louing then?
            
            
               What should I say? A firmer man
               in kindnesse then was he
               I haue not knowne, nor at this day
               a firmer man can see.
            
            
               And what I write thus in his prayse,
               I write not for reward,
               But to the end that other of
               his sort might haue regard
            
            
               To sample out their deedes by his
               in gentlemanly loue,
               
                  
Which though it bring no profite here
               shall breede them gaine aboue:
               For they must dye, as he is dead,
               Though neare so high they beare their head.
            
            
               Quid sumus (O miseri) nisi puluis motus ab aura,
               Et fragili vitro similes, vmbraeque fugaci?
            
            
               What are we (O wretches) by nature and kind,
               But ashes and dust blowne about with the winde?
               And sampled by semblance, much like brittle glasse,
               And like to the shadowe that swiftly doth passe?
            
            
               Mors tua, mors Christi, fraus mundi gloria coeli,
               Et dolor inferni, sunt meditanda tibi.
            
            
               Thy death, Christs death, the worlds deceipt,
               with hels infernall paine,

            A liuely description of Ingratitude by a Fable of a Serpent and a wayfaring man.
            
               A Serpent fast enclosed in a Caue,
               Vpon the mouth whereof a stone did lye,
               Did piteously complaine and succour craue
               Of such as then by chaunce were passing by.
               A man there was that did regard his crie,
               And to the Serpents suite this answere gaue:
               Thou wilt inuade my life if thine I saue.
            
            
               The Serpent then vnto the man replide,
               O no, not so, but rather if by thee
               My life be sau'd, which else is here destroyde,
               Ile giue thee then the chiefest thing that yee
               Of humane race and kinde accustom'd be
               To giue to those who haue done for you most:
               O saue me man, else here my life is lost.
            
            
               The man much pitying his distressed case,
               Remou'd the stone and let the Serpent out:
               Who being out, did straight his limmes embrace
               And with his hissing wound his legges about:
               Herewith the man grew into fearefull doubt,
               And asking what his meaning was thereby,
               To kill thee (quoth the Serpent, here to dye:
            
            
               For such is the reward (quoth he) that men
               On earth do giue and euery where bestow
               
                  
On those who vnto them most firme, haue ben:
               Ingratitude from each ones brest doth flow,
               And there is none from whome requitals grow.
               The man denying this, they both agreed
               That Iudges should decide the case: so on they yeede,
            
            
               And as they passe, they meete an aged horse,
               Deathes picture sure was he, whome late before
               The owner had thrust forth without remorse:
               They in this case of theirs his helpe implore
               The feeble horse all galde, which grieu'd him sore,
               Accepted of the charge, and thus began:
               There was a time (quoth he) my selfe know whan,
            
            
               For many yeeres a maister I did serue,
               Who in my youth was glad to vse me well,
               But being olde, he gaue me leaue to sterne,
               Because that olde, I lame and feeble fell:
               And though in youth I bare away the bell,
               And was esteemde, yet now, my labour past,
               He thrusts me forth an Abiect at the last.
            
            
               Loe, thus you heare (quoth Serpent) what he saies:
               The like requitall must thou haue of me:
               Not so sir) said the man: This horses prayse
               Is of himselfe: And yet you plainly see
               His ill deserts, not Age the causes be,
               And being now enlargde from former toyle,
               Here may he shift to liue vpon this Soyle.
            
            
               And therefore from his Sentence I appeale,
               And will be tride by one that is vpright:
               
                  
This idle Iade decideth not of zeale,
               But what he speakes, he speaketh in despight,
               And would much more if malice were of might:
               The next we meete therefore shall hea
                     •
                  e the strife,
               For why (quoth he) it doth concerne my life.
            
            
               Then forward still they passe till at the length
               They meete a dogge, whom also age had worne,
               A sily Curre was he cleane void of strength,
               And one who many miseries had borne,
               An halter lately this poore dogge had torne,
               For why, the end then compassed his necke,
               Whereby it seem'd he had escapte a checke.
            
            
               The matter then vnto this dogge declarde,
               Like doome he gaue, as did the horse before,
               Whereat the Serpent as a victor farde,
               But yet for this the man would not giue ore,
               But tooke exceptions nothing lesse, but more:
               This halters end (quoth he) doth well reueale
               What this dogge is: wherefore I do appeale
            
            
               From him as from the horse: that halters end
               Doth shew, that he condemned was to die
               For some offence, though fortune as his friend
               That fate of his hath turned cleane awry,
               And 
                     •
                  ent him strēgth frō halters strength to flie.
               The Serpent seeing this to be so plaine,
               Could not reply, but gaue consent againe
            
            
               That this their cause should once more be referd
               To him whom: next they met. And so content
               
                  
They onward walke, and as they then conferd,
               They met a curteous Foxe who grauely went Referment of a cause to a Foxe, is a dangerous re
                        •••
                     
                     ment.
               
               In long Furd gowne, he to them hearing lent.
               Which done, withdrew himselfe that he thereby
               Might better vse aduise to iudge truly,
            
            
               And secretly vnto the man meane while thus spake:
               My friend (sayd he) thy life lies in my hand:
               Wilt thou therefore agree if for thy sake A corrupt Iudge.
               
               I iudge the cause (which doubtfully doth stand)
               Vpon thy side, that I by promise band
               Shall haue the Poultry which thou dost possesse,
               I say thy Poultry be they more or lesse?
            
            
               My Poultry? (quoth the man) how can the same
               Serue as a Guerdon for my liues release?
               There shall not one, not Pertellot by name,
               Be kept from thee, nor euer will I cease
               To yeeld thee yeare by yeare of my increase.
               Sufficeth (sayd the Foxe) thus will I do,
               I will require my selfe to go into
            
            
               The Caue to see how there the Serpent lay,
               And when the Serpent is come in t'expresse
               The maner how, Ile quickly whip away,
               And being gone, then worke thine owne redresse,
               Roll on the stone before he forward presse.
               The matter thus agreed, the Foxe retires
               Vnto the Serpent, and of him requires
            
            
               As is in sort declarde: They go yfeere
               Into the Caue, the Foxe soone skippeth out,
               
                  
The man who then was standing very neere,
               Rolles on the Stone: So things are brought abowt.
               The Stone once on, not all the learned Rowt
               Of Foxes, nor of Serpents in that feeld
               Could stirre the same or any comfort yeeld
            
            
               Vnto that traitrous worme enclosde againe.
               Then there he lyes. And now I will proceed
               To shewe the rest that hereof doth remaine,
               New dishes oft, new Appetites do breed,
               And many a one of later course doth feed,
               Tis tragicall that refleth to be tolde:
               What then? beet good or bad, our course weele holde.
            
            
               The Foxe and man togither thence do go
               In friendly sort vnto the good-mans house
               About the bargaine of the Powltry tho.
               But wilt thou goe poore Foxe? auisa vous.
               
               Thy bargaine will be scarcely worth a louse,
               Th'vnthankfulnesse that raigneth in this Age,
               I feare me Foxe, must be thy deathes presage.
            
            
               But well, what is foreset, must come to passe:
               Not onely death appointed is to all,
               But eke the maner how, as here it was:
               For nought to man or beast by chaunce doth fall,
               There is none such as men do Fortune call.
               Against blacke death no craft nor cunning swayes:
               The Foxe for all his craft must ende his daies.
            
            
               The honest man repeates vnto his wife
               The fearefull hazards he had late bene in,
               
                  
And how the Foxe preserued had his life,
               And while he spake the teares ranne downe his chin,
               Which teares with sobbes and sighes he oft did blin.
               His wife attending all the while his tale,
               At length chaungd colour and waxt wondrous pale:
            
            
               O man (quoth she) now blessed be that beast
               By whom thou art restorde to me aliue:
               Halfe that we haue is with the very least
               That we vnto that blessed Foxe should giue:
               We must make reckning neuer here to thriue,
               If vnrewarded this kinde beast should be:
               O how my soule doth long his face to see.
            
            
               Sweete wife (quoth he) thou speakest nought but truth,
               For what can be too much for lifes great gift?
               And sith I see that thou thereon hast ruth,
               I will disclose to thee an honest stift,
               Not doubting but thou wilt allow my drift.
               Thou knowst the Foxe no riches doth regard,
               Ile shewe thee then what shall be his reward:
            
            
               Two Cockes and thirteene Hennes I thinke we haue,
               And these thou knowst I count not in our State,
               And if with these a greater gift we saue,
               Then shall we passe it at an easie rate:
               For who that would haue said to me of late,
               What wilt thou giue me if I saue thy life?
               I would haue said, take all except my wife.
            
            
               The wife that earst before such Zeale had showde,
               As you haue heard, now when it came to proofe,

               Each word she spake flew vp aboue the roofe.
               The husband halfe afeard, began to stand aloofe:
               Why man (quoth she) our goods and gold are thine,
               But for the Cockes and Hennes, they all are mine.
            
            
               Giue what thou wilt, but giue it of thine owne:
               A custome tis that men do neuer mell
               With Cockes and Hennes which in the house haue growne,
               For such small wares the wife doth buy and sell:
               I tell thee man, if thou do wish me well,
               Let no such thought once creepe into thy hart:
               For I will dye before Ile see them smart.
            
            
               Alas, good man, what should he now replie?
               This peremptory speach hath crossed all:
               The Foxe for answere stayes abroad hard by,
               Expecting still what share to him should fall,
               He little thinkes what speech is in the hall.
               Well, yet the man a manly courage tooke,
               And thus he answer'd with a manly looke:

               I tell thee woman I haue past my word.
               Say what thou wilt, the matter needes must be,
               And if thou caust in kindnesse it affoord,
               I will regard thee both at bed and boord,
               But if thou seeke to thwart my true intent,
               It shall be done, and yet shalt thou repent.

                  e burning spreete,
               
                  
As that her speech, which had beene sterne and sowre,
               Grew instantly to be both calme and sweete.
               Well husband then (quoth she) if you thinke meete,
               Let it be done: yet thus much let me craue,
               That he may come by night his pray to haue:
            
            
               For if I should behold, or heare the crie
               That I am sure the sily fowles will make
               When they shall see themselues drawne forth to dye,
               Full sure I am that hart and ioynts would quake:
               Grant this therefore (sweete husband) for my sake,
               That he may come at midnight, not before,
               And I of purpose will leaue ope the dore.
            
            
               This suite of thine sweete hart (quoth he) is small,
               The Foxe I know will readily assent.
               So cheerefully he trudg'd out of the hall,
               And to the Foxe that lay hard by he went,
               Fuil soone he found the vermine by the sent,
               And making knowne to him his wiues request,
               The Foxe agreed and held it for the best.
            
            
               But in this while the wife casts by deceipt
               And plots how she her pu
                     •
                  lens liues may saue:
               In th'end she doth resolue that at receipt
               His life who sau'd her husbands life sheele haue.
               O cursed wretch whose deede doth so depraue
               The vertue that should be in humane race,
               As that for vertue vice doth come in place.
            
            
               But what ensures? the Stratagem is set,
               The Foxe at midnight comes to haue his fee,
               
                  
And thinking (wretch, that he should haue no let,
               Within the house the mortall Engins be,
               And were so plac'd because he could not see,
               That he was caught, and caught, was put to death,
               So he poore Foxe resigned vp his breath.
            
            
               And thus we see the Serpents saying here
               Is verifide that men to men doe giue
               Ill turnes for good: for so it doth appere,
               The Foxe is kild, the man he sau'd doth liue:
               Marke well the Morall whereunto we driue,
               
                  Ingratitude the Monster of our dayes,
               In men more then inbeasts it selfe displayes.
            
            
               And also note (as to our purpose fit)
               That as the man was moued much by gift
               To saue the Serpents life, and saued it,
               So was the Foxe likewise procurde to shift
               To saue the man: which to our former drift
               Is this, that liues reliefe is little waide,
               If for the same be nothing paide.

               T'is to be read what was in Athens wrought,
               By Phillippe king of Macedon, who thee
               Imployde to bring that gallant state to nought,
               By bribing those that were of best degree
               Within the same. The like who might not see
               In Englands State, of yeares not many past,
               As also what became of them at last?
            
            
               It were too long to reckon vp the whole,
               How Golde corrupts by manifolde degrees,
               And how for it full many pill and pole,
               And Lawyers some, do take excessiue fees:
               Thou Golde canst make men flie about like Bees.
               But more then that, (would God that were the wurst)
               Thou mak'st men swell with pride as they would burst.
            
            
               And yet hereby I touch not Lawyers State,
               Nor haue intent to quippe the learned sorte:
               That were an Office for a scurrile mate,
               For there are Lawyers of most worthy Porte,
               Who still holde out as doth a fensed Forte,
               Well getting Golde, and not enclinde to Pride,
               For which good sort due Honors do abide.
            
            
               
               And for the Iudges of our Common lawe,
               I speake it from my heart, and so I holde
               That there are none can say, they euer sawe
               One Iudge that's now aliue corrupt with golde.
               God graunt that they in like sort may be bolde

               Least else the small should be the great ones meate.
            
            
               I will conclude. Not eu'ry State of men,
               But some almost in eu'ry State there are,
               Who may be wrought the good with bad to blen,
               If golde, thou golde canst growe vnto their share:
               And though that some of them perhaps haue care
               To do no wrong, yet wrong they will permit,
               As when they should giue helpe, they silent sit.
            
            
               But for as much as many men are led
               By many waies to start aside for Golde,
               And that the mischiefes which are daily bred
               By Moneys sway, are great and manifold,
               So great I feare, as hardly can be tolde,
               Therefore I ende my endlesse plaint with this,
               That God must mend what gold hath made amis.

            The Author.
            
               ANd here my Booke shall haue his end
               with my complaint of Gold;
               God graunt that high and holy thing▪
               
               in sound estate may hold
            
            
               And as the seate of Iustice is
               At this day firme and pure,
               So passages vnto the same
               may be both plaine and sure,
            
            
               Not clogd with shifts and falsitie:
               by such as haue to deale
               Inferiourly with Iustice in
               our English common-weale
            
            
               That Sut
                     •
                  rs may be 
                     〈…〉
                  
               
               before they be opprest
               With bribes and charges in their sute
                     •
                  
               
               and so for all the rest,
               That Gold may neuer beare the sway,
               But that true vertue flourish may.
            
            FINIS.
