            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

By which hee pretendeth himselfe was moued,
And endeuoureth to moue others to be reconciled to the

                  I cannot but marueile that M. Doctour in inueighing so much against that which hee cals the new religion should in quoting thereof forsake the old translation. Mine heart will vtter foorth a good matter, I will intreat in my workes of the King.

Cum Priuilegio.
            
         
         
            
            
            TO THE KINGS
MOST EXCELLENT
MAIESTIE.
            
               DREAD SOVERAIGNE,
            
            
               HAD this Letter of Dr. Carier
beene imparted, or the drift of it
onely reached to your Maiestie, it
would haue deserued none other answere
then your Maiesties priuate
censure; and might well haue beene buried in silence
with the Author of it: But now that it not only aymes
in particular at all the members of the bodie Politike,
First the Nobles, then the Commons, and lastly the
Clergie; but withall is published to the view of the
World, and spread through all the quarters of your
Land, for the better effecting of that it aymes vnto;
and is not a little magnified by the Romish faction:
It must needs argue in vs, either want of wisedome
in preuenting a mischiefe, or of power in prouiding

for our owne safetie, or of zeale and sinceritie in our
loue to the Trueth, if it should passe without some discouery,
aswell of the malicious scope to which it tends,
as the weakenesse of the arguments by which it endeuours
to perswade.
            The maine end which it driues at, is either a totall
reconcilement to the Church of Rome; or if that
cannot be, a partiall toleration of the Romish Religion.
            The generall meanes by which it striues to compasse
this end, are first by working a destraction euen
amongst those your Subiects, who euery way conforme
themselues aswell to the doctrine, as the discipline
of the Church of England, established by publike
allowance, in making some Puritanes, and some
Protestants, who in his languageCap. 2. Sect. 41. 
               can endure the
state of the Church of England as it is, but could
be content it were as it was: (implying thereby
the rest to be Puritanes) some Caluinists and some
temperate men,
               Cap. 2. Sect. 45. 
               who cannot but in iudgment
approue the trueth of that Religion which he
calles Catholike, (thereby implying the rest to bee
Caluinists) the one he termes the greatest enemies
of the Clergie, the other his honest and louing
brethren, wherof he professeth he knew many,
and himselfe to be one: whereas in trueth if
any such there be, the difference should rather haue

beene made betwixt Protestants and Papists, English
and Romish Catholikes, since they who could
be content the Church of England were as it was
before the Reformation, can in my iudgement bee
none other then Papists; and those that in their iudgement
approue the doctrine of the pretended Catholike
Religion, can (as farre as I apprehend it) been none
other then Romish Catholikes. Thus those whom
we call Papists, he calles Temperate Protestants,
and those whom we call Protestants, he calles State
Puritanes.
            
            The second generall meanes for the compassing of
his desired end, is an indeuour to worke an vtter seperation
betwixt our Church and other reformed
Churches, specially those of France, and the Netherlands;
whom therefore in contempt hee calls Hugonots,
and Geux, and their doctrine Caluinisme;
intending thereby, (as I conceiue) either to weaken
our strength, by leauing vs to stand single, or, which
is worse, to inforce vs at length to relapse vpon
Rome: And to this purpose is hee bold to affirme,
that their doctrine makes as much against the Religion
of England, as that of Rome; whereas the
writings of the most learned men, aswell on their, as
on our side, our harmonies of Confessions, the testimonie
of our aduersaries, nay, theImpia mysteria &amp; instituta ad Caluini praescriptum a se suscepta &amp; obseruata, etiam a subditis seruari mandauit, circa med. bull. Pope himselfe in

                Bookes, and practise in the matching of
that Noble Ladie, your daughter, and in permitting
those Churches the free exercise of their Religion
within your dominions, so plainely euince the contrarie,
that I wonder, hauing let fall so foule a blot from
his pen, he durst present it to your Maiesties view:
and yet I neede not wonder, considering hee was not
ashamed to tell your Maiesty, that for any thing you
haue written in your Apologie, or Premonition,
you may when you please, admitte the Popes Supremacie
in spirituals: which must needes argue, either
that he was meerely ignorant what your Maiesty had
written, or cared not at all what himselfe wrote; regarding
rather the euennesse of his Stile, and the cadencie
of his sentences, then the trueth of his assertions;
like false windowes, bearing proportion with the
rest of the building, but without light.
            By the trueth of these assertions, your Maiestie
may make an estimate of the whole piece; in which, if
I can iudge any thing, I haue not met within the narrow
compasse of so short a treatise, so formally pend,
and carrying so faire an outside; so many weake arguments,
so many grosse mistakes, so many notorious
falshoods, so many irreconciliable contradictions,
so many sandie and disioynted consequences:
howsoeuer were his proofes neuer so strong, so sure,
so true, so consonant, so coherent; yet was hee a man

most vnfit to intermeddle in a businesse of vnion,
and pacification; who was so farre ingaged to one
partie, as by his owne acknowledgement hee was perswaded,
Cap. 1. Sect. 20. that all the Religion at this day prescribed,
and practised by the Church of Rome, is the true
Catholike Religion; and promiseth particularly to iustifie
it from point to point, when time and opportunitie
should serue: and your Maiestie, together with
vs of the same profession, he rangethCap. 1. Sect. 13. among Iewes,
and Infidels, and heretiques, for refusing to ioine with
them in the worship of Christ in the Sacrament.
            But God blessed not his vaine proiect, Mr. Henrie
Constable dying within fortnight after he came
from Paris, by Cardinall Perrons appointment, to
Leidge, to conferre with him; and himselfe a while
after in Paris, within a moneth of his comming thither
to conferre with the Cardinall; yet as the Apostle
speakes of Abel, being dead, he yet speaketh,
though in a different manner, and the speach of dead
men commonly prooues more effectuall, more profitable,
or more dangerous then that of the liuing.
            For your Maiesty, there is (God be thanked) no
feare at all; the obligations by which you haue tied
your selfe to the Religion established amongst vs, being
so many and so strong, and withall his motiues for
inducement to the contrary, so weake; dealing with
your Maiesty as the deuill did with our Sauiour, who

being beaten from Scripture, fell to the promising
of the glory of kingdomes, which notwithstanding
was not in his power to performe; onely for
their sakes, some Replie seemed not vnnecessary, of
whom it may truely be sayd, which hee falsly affirmes
of your Maiesty, thatCap. 2. Sect. 6. 
               they imbrace shadowes
instead of substances, which as a matter of high
commendation, he solemnely protests, he gladly wrote,
and so gaue it out with all the honour hee could of your
Maiesty: But such kinde of commendation, as your
Maiesty truely telleth Cardinall Perron, is none other,
then if a man should commend a souldier
for his faire haire, and call him coward to his
face.
            
            Now because the Letter, (though not without
some marke of presumption) is by the Author, not onely
dedicated, but throughout directed to your Maiesty,
(as if he meant to fight, neither with small nor
great, saue onely against the King) I was imboldned
humbly to submit this my defence of trueth
to the Royall arbitrement of the same sacred, and vnpartiall
vmpire, hoping to find the censure somewhat
more fauourable, in as much, as I haue made bold to
borrow the greatest part of my weapons, both offensiue
and defensiue, from the rich armourie of your
Maiesties writings, wherin already, though seuered,
as in the tower of DAVID, built for defence,

hang a thousand shields and all the targets of
the strong men: but being ranged into one volume
as vnited forces, they would doubtlesse haue more
strength, aswell to assault as to resist, both the tongues
and pens of men, and the teeth of time▪ Hauing lighted
my candle then at your Maiesties torch, I thought my
selfe in duety bound to offer it vpon the same altar
againe.
            Hee was your Maiesties seruant, and so am I,
both vnworthy, though in a different respect; hee
sworne to serue your Maiestie, which how he performed
at last, this Letter can best speake, and your Maiestie
best iudge; my selfe sworne to your Maiestie,
for the seruice of your most Noble Sonne the Prince,
my most sweete and gracious Master, whose quickenesse
of Spirit, loue of Vertue, and sense of true Religion,
though I haue now by a good space obserued sensibly
to grow faster then his yeeres, yet being but tender
in age, and consequently not fully ripened in iudgment;
I tho
                  •
               ght I might herein doe him some seruice
for his better information, to marke out vnto him such
passages in your Maiesties writings, as serue for a
satisfaction to such passages of the letter as may concerne
him; hoping thereby hee may somewhat the rather bee moued to
goe on as hee hath happily begunne,
till hee arriue to that perfection which Plinie commends

to Traian, Facere scribenda, scribere legenda.
I conclude with that repetition of the prayer
of Dauid for you both: Giue thy iudgements to
the King (O God) and thy righteousnesse to
the Kings sonne; that your dayes may bee
vpon earth as the dayes of heauen, both for glory
and lasting▪ and for your Maiesty, with that acclamation
of the Romans to their Emperours,
            De nostris annis tibi Iupiter augeat annos.
            
               Your MAIESTIES most humbly
deuoted subiect and seruant,

            THE AVTHOR
to the Reader.
            
               WHAT Dr. Carier was for his ranke, the
degrees and places of charge hee held
and passed through (expressed at large
in the Printers Epistle, prefixed to his Letter)
will speake sufficiently, though I
were silent; what for his learning, this Letter will
partly testifie; and for his other qualities such informations
as were offered mee, though by men of credite,
and I could haue gathered out of diuers of his
Letters and Papers, which I haue in mine hands, I
chose rather to suppresse in silence then to publish:
His immoderate Ambition alone, (which himselfe so
freely acknowledgeth in diuers places) was doubtlesse
sufficient to corrupt a stronger iudgement then
his, in matter of Religion; specially being crossed in
his designes: That was it, which cast the Angels out of
heauen, and Adam out of Paradise, and still casteth
most Apostates out of the Church.
            Ambition sayeth one (whom Master Doctor in his
Letter deseruedly commendeth for a worthy Gentleman)
is like choler, which is an humour that maketh men,

actiue, earnest, full of alacritie and stirring, if it be not stopped:
but if it be stopped and can not haue his way it becommeth
adust, and thereby maligne and venemous: so ambitious
men if they find the way open for their rising, and still
get forward, they are busie rather then dangerous; but if
they be checked in their desires they become secretly discontent
and looke vpon men and matters with an euill eye; and
if they rise not with their seruice, they will take order to
make their seruice fall with them.
            
               Now, what opinion was helde of him abroad by
Romish Catholikes, after his departure from vs and our
Church, let Pelitier and Fitz-Simon testifie, the one in
French, the other in Latine.Discours de la mort du Sieur Carter, &amp;c. La memoire de cest homme

personage de singuliere erudition et fort versé en la lecture
des Saincts Peres, il recogneut en fin dans leurs escrits
Comme dans vne glace luisante, la viue image de l' Eglise
Catholique tant aux points essentielles de la Religion qu' en
la police, et gouernment d'icelle. Hitherto Pelitier; but

               So that it seemed needfull some answere should bee
made to his treatise, if for none other reason, yet in regard
of so great an opinion conceiued of his worth
and sufficiencie: But sure I am of opinion, that had
he beene a man of that moderation in matter of Religion,
(as through this Treatise hee would beare his
Maiestie and the world in hand) hee had neither died
among the Iesuits, as Pelitier testifies in the conclusion
of his pamphlet, nor receiued such a testimonie from
Fitz-Simon by nation an Irishman, &amp; a Iesuit by profession:
Howsoeuer, sure I am that talking of Vnitie and
Peace (the pretended scope of Mr. Drs letter) as termes
now stand betweene vs, sauours not of a Iesuits spirit.
We for our parts freely professe, as Mr
                Casaubon doth
in his Maiesties name. [Let them in whose power it is to
performe it, offer vs such a peace, of which it may bee sayd,
Peace &amp; trueth haue kissed each other, and the controuersie
is at an end:] Let them seuer humane ordinances from diuine,
superstitious from godly, new from ancient, needlesse
from necessary, I say againe (saith he) and with as loude a
crie and much earnestnesse as may be, I proclaime it, that all

men may heare me, for as much as concernes his Maiesty,
and the Church of England, the controuersie is at an end.
His Maiesties intent and full resolution is, that they in
vaine talke or thinke of Peace, who sunder that heauenly
yoke of vnitie and verity; but (saith hee in conclusion,
speaking to the Romanists;) their purpose is constantly
to maintaine all they hold, not to reconcile the minds of well
disposed persons, by the reformation of that which is amisse;
in which purpose as long as they shall persist, his Maiestie
professeth once for all, that he will entertaine no societie, no
Communion at all with the Church of Rome: And in this
case we sticke not to professe with Nazianzene, that
there is a kind of holy warre, in which who so dies, shal
vndoubtedly obtaine of the chiefe Bishop of our
soules, a Plenary Indulgence for his sinnes, and

Hillary, Amiable is the name of peace, and louely the opinion
of vnity, but who doubts that to bee the onely Peace of
the Church, which is the Peace of Christ? and lastly
with Cyprian, [He is not reconciled to the Church, who is
separated from the Gospel.] Now because M. Doctour
would perswade the 
                     •
                  orld, and his Maiestie himselfe,
that at his first entrance into this kingdome, hee was more
inclineable to reconcilement, and laboureth by promising
honour and riches and security to reduce him
againe to the same pretended inclination, it shall not
be amisse (beside that which I haue spoken to this
point in diuerse parts of mine answere) to acquaint
the Reader with his Maiesties protestation (euen while
matters were yet in a mammering) made to Watson, as
himselfe confessed to the late Earle of Northampton,
               See the late B. of Lincolnes answere to a namelesse Catholike, p. 115. That all the Crownes and kingdomes in this world should
not induce him to change any iot of his profession which was

the pasture of his soule, &amp; earnest of his eternal inheritance;
and as he thus protested at his first entrance, so in the
conclusion of one of his last speeches to the Parliament,
he sheweth himselfe in this point euer like himselfe.
[May 21. 1610 I am now out of conscience and for security (saith
he) not to forget religion; I spake to you last as a Prophet,
that twas likely the Papists had some new plot in hand, now
you see it is come to passe, and I will let you know this much,

ouer, and with their poison infect others: This one day will
make you smart, if it be not preuented.] And I pray God
his Maiestie doe not proue as true a Prophet in this latter,
as the successe shewed him in the former; how soeuer,
it sufficeth to shew his Maiesties auersenes from
all maner of reconcilement, things standing in the

setled determination was (as he had before signified

to Cardinall Perron) not at all to shake hands with
Rome, whiles her whordomes and withcrafts yet remaine
in such abundance.
            My wish and hearty prayer to God is, and I think
not mine alone, but of all good men, neither would
I account my life deare to be spent in the furtherance
of it, that the miserable rent, and wide woundes,
which at this day wee see in the Christian world, in
matter of Religion, might by some good meanes be
closed vp, for the sparing of the effusion of so much
Christian blood, the securing of the Crownes of
Christian Princes, the setling of so great distraction
in Christian mindes, the wiping away of the scandall
of diuision, from the Christian profession, and lastly
resisting with vnited forces, the common enemie of
the blessed and glorious name of Iesus Christ: But as
long as theSee the relation of the state of religion in these Westerne parts which it were much to be wished, the Author himselfe would perfect and publish. Bishop of
Rome shal hang the faith of his
followers on this Principle [I and my Church cannot
possibly erre] and with the same stoppe the mouths of
all his opposites, bee the force and euidence of their
arguments neuer so cleare and stronge; I cannot conceiue
otherwise of such a wish then of an honest desire,
but without any apparent hope of successe. For
if diuine authoritie doe concurre with them in all
their ordinances, if Gods Spirit infallibly assist them
in all their decisions, what remaines there, but only
that they teach, wee beleeue, they command, and
the world obey? Indeed in humane gouernments
where reason is shut out, there tyrannie is thrust in;
but where God commandeth, to aske a reason, is presumption,
to disobey, rebellion: to this miserable necessitie
haue their assertions tied them which they

haue laid for their eternall foundation; miserable to
themselues, and miserable to the whole world; nay,
in so many conferences as haue beene held in this age
for pacification, it hath beene truely obserued, that
ere they parted, they plainely discouered, they came
not with any such intent, as to yeeld any thing for
Peace, much lesse for Trueths sake, but onely to assay
either by perswasion to reduce, or otherwise by cunning
to intrap and disgrace their aduersaries; and if
some one of them haue shewed himselfe more moderate
at any time, it hath beene his vtter disgrace with
his owne partie for euer after. Now for the manner
of mine answering, I haue set downe his text at large
in his owne words, without altering or adding so
much as a sillable (except it were to make sense where
I found none) imputing the errour thereof to the
Printer, rather then the Author, I haue followed the
Methode of his owne diuision, for the most part, both
in the Chapters &amp; Sect. The maine scope of euery Sect.
I haue answered in the bodie of my Reply, stretching
the force of his Arguments, sometimes beyond the
extent of the Letter; &amp; such extrauagant matters, as
he drawes in vpon the bye, I thought it sufficient to
reply vnto, in my marginall notes, so that in one of the
two, nothing I thinke worth the answering hath escaped
vnanswered; and I shall craue that curtesie of
the Reader, if he receiue not satisfaction in the one,
to haue recourse to the other; and this I take to bee
faire and iust dealing without exception; once I am
sure I haue dealt with him as my selfe in like case
should desire to be dealt withall, which I take to bee
the safest rule of iust dealing. Surely a matter it is of

little labour and credite; but lesse honestie, to deale as

out of the publike Register; or as Eudaemon (the common
packehorse of Rome) hath lately dealt with my
Lord of Salisburie, answering his Antilogie, a booke of
about 60. sheetes, full of varietie of learning, and

                  •
               uident proofe, with a Libel of some three or foure
sheets at most, which he hath also rather stained, with
rayling at persons, and catching at words, then
made offer to answere so much as one materiall
point; and to speake a trueth, I haue good reason to
thinke, he rather wrote it that the title might be seen
                  •
               
in the common Catalogue, then that the Booke it
selfe might commonly bee read; in regarde that the
worke is so slender, and the copies so few, that as it is
scarce to be had, so is it scarce worth the reading being
had: himselfe professeth that he wrote it [Ne magni
aliquid latere in 
                     •
                  o libro putarent, quē nemo confutasset:
Lest men should thinke some great matter lay hidden
in that booke, which no man had confuted:] but hee
that shall compare both, may well say, notwithstanding
his answere, that no man hath yet confuted it.
            Somewhat more wisely and warily hath he dealt
with Casaubons Exercitations, answering onely the
fourth chapter of his first Exercitation, and promising
a whole volume to follow after against the rest,
in imitation belike of Richard Stanihurst, who hath
published his flourish to a future combate with his

Nephew Mr. Dr. VSher; but I thinke wee shall see the
full encounters both of the one and the other, by leasure.

An easie matter it is to promise great matters, but not
so easie to performe them being promised: For mine
owne part, I must confesse, I haue made a larger answere
then either the treatise answered deserued, or
the state of my bodie, and my leisure (being to make
so often returnes from a remote part of the Kingdome
to mine attendance in Court) could well permit,
or indeed my selfe at first proiected; but I haue
now found it true in mine owne experience, which I
haue often heard obserued by others, to fall out many
times in writing, as it doth in building: many alterations
and additions present themselues, besides,
and beyond the first designe. It was written of Fame,
but it may as truely be said of this kind of writing,

It gathers strength in going, as in eating a man sometimes
gets a stomack: which was the reason (together
with an expectation, that either some more able pen
would haue vndertaken this encounter, or some matter
of greater importance promised by the Author
himselfe, and Pelitier, would ere this haue beene published
to the world) that mine answere hath beene
differred till now: but if it be well enough, it is soone
enough, how well it is, let the reader iudge, whom

notwithstanding, I shall desire to suspend his iudgement▪
till hee haue heard both parties speake, which
request mee thinkes is but reasonable, considering I
haue dealt so fauourably with the aduerse party, as
to set downe all at full, that hee could say for
himselfe: With whom, if I deale in mine answering
as if hee were still aliue, it is to bee ascribed to
himselfe, who in the conclusion of his Letter, professeth
hee sent his soule therein; neither is that I haue
done herein without example of those, by whose
greatnesse if need were, small faults might be countenanced;
it is (I hope) sufficient that I neither intend
thereby to wrong the dead, or deceiue the
liuing:
            Neither let it bee thought blameable, that being
by profession a diuine, I haue medled so much in
matters of state; it was rather out of the necessitie
of the arguments to bee replied vnto, then any desire
or disposition of mine owne, farther then to
make it appeare to the world, that the Religion by vs
professed, is more sutable to the preseruation of the
ciuill power, and in speciall the forme of policie established
among vs, then that religion which dares accuse
ours of the contrary; of which I may truely say
that (in the termes it now stands) it doth not so much
vphold temporall policie, as it is vpheld by it, and
yet like the iuie which riseth by clasping the oake,

had none other supports, but the meere euidence of
trueth and diuine assistance, and so according to that
receiued principle of nature, being still nourished by

the same meanes as it was first bredde, it makes vs
confident that it will both grow the better and last
the longer. Thus commending thee to Gods grace,
the worke to thy charitable censure, and my selfe to
thy Christian prayers, I rest.

            G. H.
            
               IT seemes you had not so exactly perused
this ensuing Treatise, as in the front
you pretend, in as much as you tell vs,
that the Author thereof from his greener
yeeres wallowed himselfe in the
choisest writings of the most learned Protestants;
whereas himselfe in his first chapter and fifth Section,
professeth, that when he first tooke himselfe to the studie
of Diuinitie, setting aside all respect of men then aliue, and
of Writers that had mooued or maintained Controuersies,
farther then to vnderstand the question that was betwixt
them, he fell to the reading of the Church Historie and ancient
Fathers, which had no interest on either side: Indeed
he telleth vs before this, he read ouer our English Chronicles,
and except this Were his wallowing in the choisest
writings of the most learned Protestants, I vnderstand
not out of his owne relation what was:
Once I am sure he affirmes meere vntruths touching
Caluins doctrine (which I take it hee vnderstands by
Caluinisme) faining him to teach, that the Sacraments
of the Church bee nothing but signes and badges of that
grace, which a man hath before, by the carnall couenant of
his Parents faith, and that Priesthood can doe nothing but
preach the word, which lay men may do also if they wil: positions
so directly opposite not only to Caluins words,
but his grounds and reasons, that it makes me suspect
he neuer reade him nor so much as his Maiesties either
Apologie or Premonition; in both which he plainely
and largely impugneth the Bishop of Romes vsurped
power in spirituals, which the Dr. notwithstanding

and that in his letter to his Maiestie himselfe.
            But you found the treatise, you say, both in stuffe
and style, to be learnedly and eloquently contriued: It may
be said of eloquēce without learning, as of the Nightingale,
that it is vox &amp; praeterea nihil, A sounding brass
                     •
                  
or tinkling Cymball: Neither doe I see how that can
well be called a learned peece of worke, which treating
of Christian religion, alleadgeth not so much as
one passage of Scripture throughout, nor alludeth to
any by way of proofe; and quoteth of the Ancients
onely, S. Augustine twice, but not against vs, and
S. Ambrose once, but against his meaning, as shall appeare
in his proper place: and among latter Writers
Sir Francis Bacons Essayes, where no such thing as hee
quotes is to be found, and Caluins life written by Beza,
which rather makes much against himselfe, then in
any sort for him; besides this, hee borroweth a sentence
or two out of Aristotles Politikes, which he fathereth
vpon the Fathers, and this is the learned
stuffe you so much bragge of.
            From the worke you passe to the Author, who gained
fame (you say) amongst the Protestants, hauing beene
a Teacher in their Colledges, a Preacher in their P

Reuben among the Patriarchs, and Saul among the
Prophets, and Iulian among the Christian Emperors,
and Nestorius among the Bishops, and Sergius among
the Monkes, and Lucifer among the Angels, and Satan
among the children of God; Hee went out from vs
because he was not of vs, for if he had beene of vs, he would

               Stella cadens non est stella, cometa fuit.
His falling away proues him to haue beene a blazing
but neuer a fixed starre: Which that I haue good
reason to thinke, his owne words written with his
owne hand, and taken out of his common place
booke, shall testifie, where he proposes the question.

            Which hee thus resolues: Catholicus extra externam

            From whence in my iudgement it cannot well be collected
otherwise, but that while his body was with
vs, his soule was vnited to Rome, and that euen before
his leauing vs, he left no stone vnmoued for the publique
good of that Church.
            
               
Lastly, for that vniforme and setled consent of the ancient
Fathers, and those pregnant points and sound and
grounded reasons of the Author which the Prefacer
pretends; it will easily appeare at first view, that the
former appeares not in this Treatise: and for the latter,
they may appeare to the vnlearned and vnstable,
who like children are carried about with euery blast
of vaine doctrine; but to such as are sound in the faith
which was once deliuered to the Saints, and grounded
in the principles of Christian religion, I am sure his
reasons can neither appeare sound nor grounded.
            
            Those foure quotations of Scripture which are set
by the Prefacer in his margin (being more by foure
then are to be found in the Treatise it selfe) the thicknesse
of my marginall notes inforced me to omit; and
yet if I had figured them as I finde them there, the
Reader in searching would haue missed them, the 11.
and 19. of Iames being put for the 1. and the 17. the
15. to the Heb. for the 11. and Psalm. 83. 12. for 84. 11.
But herein it may be hee followed the diuision of the
vulgar edition, and the rest I am content to impute to
the Printer.

TO HIS LETTER.
            
               Most Excellent and Renowned Soueraigne,
            
            
               IT is not vnknowne to all those that knowe
me in England, that for these many yeeres
I had my health very ill, and therefore hauing
from time to time vsed all the meanes
and medicines that England could afford;
Last of all, by the aduice of my Phisitians, I made mine
humble suite vnto your Maiestie, that I might trauell vnto
the Spaw for the vse of those waters, purposing with my
selfe that if I could be well, I would goe from thence to Heydelberge,
and spend this winter there. But when I was gone
from the Spaw to Aquisgrane, and so to Colin, I found
my selfe, rather worse then better then I was before, and
therefore I resolued with my selfe that it was high time for
me to settle my thoughts vpon another world: And seeing
I was out of hope to enioy the health of my body, at the least
to looke to the health of my soule, from whence bothYou might haue named Scripture as well as art, but it seemes you purposely forbore it, lest you shou'd seeme a Caluinist. art and

their beginning, for if I could by any study haue prooued Catholike
Religion to bee false, or by any meanes haue professed
it to beeIn your 2. chap. &amp; 21. Sect. you affirme the doctrine of the Church of Eng. to be that which is conteined in the cōmon prayer booke, and Church Catechisme, very nere agreeing with, or at least not contradicting the Church of Rome.

of my soule would haue much helped the health of my
bodie: But the more I studied theHad you brought any proofe from the Scriptures &amp; ancient Fathers for the trueth of that Religion, which you call Cathol. you would haue thereby giuen vs some rea

               IT is likewise knowen to all them that
knew you, that for these many yeres,
you haue beene more sicke in minde,
then in body, which hath appeared
not onely publikely in your Sermons
and writings; but priuately in your Conferences and
Letters: where of my selfe am in part a witnesse; but
they with whom you were longer and more familiarly
conuersant, can more fully testifie it, and though
you vsed many medicines, yet one was wanting, to
wit,1. P

                  t. 3. 4. 
               a meeke and quiet spirit, a thing before God much set
by; it being as Dauids musicke, which stilled Sauls rage;
and this I am perswaded would haue done you more
good, aswell in regard of the diseases of your body
as your minde, then any of your other medicines, or
all of them put together: among which your last was
the Spaw waters, which I graunt, you might vse by
aduice of Physitians; but I haue withall reason to
thinke the voyage out of his Maiesties dominions into
those parts, was by you intended rather for the fuller
&amp; safer discouering of the sickenes of your mind,
then the recouering of that of your body: which your
selfe in this very Preface confesse vpon the matter, in
as much as being (you say) suspected &amp; condemned as a
common enemy, and hauing no way to auoid your griefe, nor
meanes to endure it, you desired to withdraw your selfe from
the sight and offence of those who hated Catholike Religion:
whereby I presume you meane such as opposed your
turbulent courses, labouring vnder pretence of Catholike
Religion, and olde English diuinitie, to bring

in, and set vp, the new Romish; and considering you
stood so affected, it seemeth to me strange you should
purpose a iourney to Heydelberge, and the spending of
a winter there, being so profested an enemy to all Caluinists,
except you hoped to conuert Abraham Scultet,
Or Dauid Parrey: My selfe passed one whole winter
amongst them, and vnlesse their opinions be since
altered, or you had altered yours before your comming
thither, or at least concealed them at your being
there, you would doubtlesse before the winter had
passed, growen more weary of them then of vs: But
being (you say) vpon the way at Colin, you found your
selfe worse, and thereupon resolued it was high time to
settle your thoughts vpon another world, and being out of
hope to enioy the health of your bodie, at least to looke to the
health of your soule; So that by your owne confession,
you made a vertue of necessitie, then resoluing to settle
your selfe, when you expected not long after the
dissolution of your body; then to fixe your thoughts
vpon God, when you perceiued you could not long
remaine in the world; which as it is lesse acceptable
to God, then for a man to consecrate the flowre and
strength of his age to him, so is it in the doctrine of
the Church of Rome lesse meritorious in it selfe, and in
reason not so exemplar to draw others: Had you determined
to forsake a falshod, and imbrace a trueth
for the meere loue of truth without worldly respects,
men would rather haue inclined to thinke that true
which you had imbraced; had you hoped to rise
higher, and liue longer, and yet not held your life or
hope of honor deare; in regard of that future life and
glory which you hoped for by the change of your

Religion, you might sooner haue induced others to
follow your steps: but for a man so ambitious as your
selfe, by your owne acknowledgement, who by striuing
against the streame, had put himselfe not onely
out of hope of rising higher; but almost out of breath
to, and all hope of liuing much longer, to seeke that
name and fame in dying abroad, which he saw could
not bee gotten by liuing at home; it may perhaps
worke somewhat with those who iudge of matters
onely by euents, as Geometricians measure the height
of towres by their shadowes, and are ready to turne
euery accident to an argument for their owne purposes;
but such as iudge of euents by looking into their
causes (which not many loue much to busie their
braines about, nor are indeed capable of) and frame
not arguments to their opinions; but contrariwise
submit their opinions to the soundnesse
and force of argument; such I

shame, A that if it had bene in my power to

to enioy them, and if I should for my priuate commodity speake, or

and against the euidence of mine owne conscience, I must shortly appeare
before the presence of the same Christ, in the presence of the
same his Church, to giue an account thereof. Therefore I neither

                  GEORGE HAKEWIL.
                  1.
                  
                     A In saying you would neuer haue bene a Catholike,
                     He repeats the same phrase in diuers other places. 
                     if it had
bene in your power to choose, you seeme to fall vpon that opinion
which is wrongfully thrust vpon Caluin, that wee are conuerted,
as it were, by constraint, whether we will or no, and consequently you ouerthrow both the freedome of will, and the merit of worke.
                  
                     B It seemes then your father, who brought you vp, did
much abhorre a Papist, and yet you confesse in the next Section
that he was a learned and deuout man, and that he seasoned you
with the principles of piety and deuotion.
                  
                  
                     C Your great hopes were indeed alwayes beyond your iust

                     D 
                     So it seemes you resolued for the pretended Catholike religion
before your parting from hence: howbeit before, you
beare vs in hand, that you got licence to trauell to the Spaw, onely
for your health, and afterward you tell vs, that you went hence,
hoping to finde some greater offence in the seruice of the Church of
Rome, then you had done in their bookes, that so you might returne

the word Mysterie engrauen on his diademe, since in the seuenteenth
of the Reuel. at the fift verse it is foretold, it should
be [written on the forehead of the

I would know what Religion was ener in the world which inuented
a policie like to the Popes dispensations in generall,
but specially in Mariages, it being hitherto the best stake in

his hedge, and without exception the strongest sinew for the
tying of Christian Princes vnto him, as to their head, they being
made many of them by it legitimate, and illegitimate
without it: So they stand in a maner bound to defend his authority
with the same sword, that they do their own Crownes.
And I am verily perswaded, were it not that they lie obnoxious
to him in this regard, some of them would not sticke so
close to him as they doe, especially since the publishing of his
Maiesties learned and godly premonition vnto them. Farther,
what vse they make of Confessions for the discouerie of
all secrets, as well of nature as of States, Indulgences, Canonizations,
Consecrations, Of their bloodie Inquisition, which
like a sharpe Northerne winde nippes the spring of Religion
in the bud, Of forging false Authours, and corrupting the true,
Of suppressing the bookes of our Writers, and correcting their
owne, Of spreading false rumors, and razing all antiquitie that
makes against them, the world hath long since discouered.
Besides all this, they haue a baite for euery fish, a motiue to
draw euery seuerall humour: for an ambitious disposition they
haue a triple Crowne, or a Cardinals cap; for a Contemplatiue,
a Monkes cloister, or a Friars coule; for a working practical
head, imployment in State affaires, for a Scholasticke, preaching
&amp; writing, and in writing, some they set to meditations,
some to politike discourses, some to cases of conscience, some
to commentaries, some to controuersies, according to the seuerall
point and temper of their wits. Nay he that shal but consider
the politike forme of gouernment obserued in the onely
order of the Iesuits, their rules, their intelligence, their corespondence,
their infinite cunning deuises how to winne some
whom they desire for respects to be of their society, or to make
their friends, and to disgrace or remoue others whom they suspect
to stand in theirway, may iustly pronounce of them that
they haue perfectly learned the former part of our Sauiours
lesson, [Matth. 10. 1
                           •
                        .

[be ye innocent as

then that it hitherto hath bin, and still is supported meerely by
the goodnesse of God, and the euidence of trueth.
                  
                     
                     H Surely, if true religion be vnchangeable, then the Romish
cannot be the true, it hauing suffered so many changes both in
doctrine and practise, that wee may now iustly question it
whether it bee the same or no, as the Schollers of Athens did

                  My next care then was after I came to yeeres of discretion
by all the best meanes I could to enforme my selfe, whether the
religion of England were indeed the very same, which being prefigured
and prophecied in the olde Testament, was perfected by our
blessed Sauiour, andHe indeede deliueredit to his Apostles and disciples to continue, but sure wee are, it continued not by that succession, and in that Church which you call visible and perpetuall, or at least not as he deliuered it: the enui

continue by perpetuall succession in his visible Church, vntill his
comming againe: or whether it were a new one for priuate purposes
of Statesmen inuented, and by humane lawes established. Of this
I could not chuse but make some doubt▪ because I heard men talke
much in those dayes of the change of religion, which was then lately
made in the beginning of Queene ELIZABETHS raigne.
               
               
                  
                  G. H.
                  3.
                  I would demaund, by M. Doctors leaue, whethermen
might not talke as much of the change of religion made in the
beginning of Queene Maries raigne, as Queene Elizabeths?
But you will say Queene Maries was a restitution to the ancient:
and wee replie, that Queene Elizabeths was a restitution
to a more ancient: and most true it is, the most ancient is the
most true. So that in this regard wee may iustly say, [Nos non
sumus nouatores, sed vos estis veteratores,] and with our Sauiour,
Matth. 19. 8. 
                     From the beginning it was not so.
                  
               
               
                  B. C.
                  4.
                  I was sorry to heare of a change and of a new religion, seeing
me thought in reason, if true religion were eternall, the new
religion could not be the true. But yet I hoped that the religion of
England was not a change, or a new religion, but a restitution of the
olde, and that the change was in the Church of Rome, which in
processe of time might perhaps grow to bee Superstitious and Idolatrous,
and that therefore England had done well to leaue the Church
of Rome, and to reforme it selfe: and for this purpose I did at my
leisure and best opportunitie, as I came to more iudgement, reade
ouer the Chronicles of England, and obserued all the a
                        •
                     terations
of religion that I could find therein: but when I found there, that
the present religion of England was a plaine change, and change
vpon change, and that there was no cause of the change at all at the
first, but onely that • King Henry the VIII. was desirous to change
his olde bedfellow, that hee might leaue some heires males behind
him (for belike hee feared the females would not bee able to withstand
the title of Scotland) and that the change was continued and
increased by the posteritie of his latter wiues, I could not chuse
but suspect some thing: But yet theObserue here the great zeale of this man, which himselfe boasteth of in the 2. S

                  You told vs before, that your care was, assoone as you came to
yeeres of discretion, by all meanes you could to enforme your selfe,
whether the religion of England were indeed the very same which
being prefigured and prophecied in the olde Testament, was perfected
by our blessed Sauiour, and deliuered to his Apostles and
disciples: and here you tell vs, that when you came to more iudgement,
for the better informing your selfe herein, you read ouer the
Chronicles of England: a proper course indeede, as if a man
should reade ouer the Chronicles of England to search, whether
the practise of our Architects in building agree with Vitruuius
his precepts, or of our husbandmen in manuring their grounds
with Columellaes rules. For mine owne part, I should rather
haue thought, that the readiest way to informe your selfe aright,
had been to compare the religion of England with the
doctrine of the Gospels, Epistles, Actes of the Apostles, and
Church history, the ende of a Chronicle being not to shew euery
alteration in religion, specially where it is made peecemeale,
insensibly, and by degrees, of which a man may say that
hee sees it is changed, though he sawe not the changing, as he
sees the grasse hath growen though he saw it nor growing, and
the shadow in a diall to haue mooued, though not moouing,
[Matth. 13. 5. 25 
                     The enuious man sowed his tares in the night, so that
men discouered it then when they sprang vp in the morning.]
but the sowing of them they could not obserue, because it was
done cunningly in the night when all men slept, and for a
time, they lay hid vnder the earth. And yet are not our Chronicles
so silent, but that they euery where lay open the iust
comp aint of our Kings, and groning of our Clergie and people
vnder the yoke of the Bishop of Rome, as shal more clearely
appeare, when we come to shew what benefit euery estate
may expect from the restitution of Romish religion▪ But you
say▪ 
                     you found the religion of England a plaine change, and change
vpon change: But our constant answere is, (that which you
professe you hoped to finde) that the change was in the
Church of Rome, our change being nothing else but the scowring

off of that rust, or the repairing of those ruines which we
found had insensibly growen vpon it. For to suppose that
tract of time cannot drawe a corruption vpon religion, aswell
as vpon ciuil affaires, is as if a man should imagine that Castles
indeede are subiect to reparations, but not Churches: and for
your pretended change vpon change, wee may boldly say, that
our Common prayer booke hath not receiued so many changes
as your Breuiaries, your Portesses, your Legends, your
Martyrologies, your Pontificals, your Ceremonials, and specially
your Missals haue done, and that since our reformation;
nay, since the framing and publishing of our Common prayer
bookes in the beginning of the reigne of Edward the VI. wee
find no change in any materiall point at all, saue that in their
Letanie they prayed to be deliuered by name from the tyrannie
and malice of the Pope, which for any thing I know, might
as iustly, and vpon as good reason haue been retained by vs,
as it was by them put in.
                  H Now why Henrie the VIII. should cause the first change in
religion out of a desire to change his bed-fellow, I see not, except
you esteeme a restraining of the Popes vnlimited power in
dispensations to be a change in religion, and indeed it may well
be, since now the world is come to that passe, that the Popes
authority, and religion are in a manner as reciprocall, as the
definition and the thing defined. And for the change of his bedfellow,
it is well knowen to those that haue read ouer our
Chronicles with obseruation (as your selfe pretend you haue)
that he being married to her at the age of 10. yeeres or thereabout,
protested against it when he came to 14. in the presence
of Richard Foxe Bishop of Winchester, and Iohn Reade a publique
Notary, as appeares by a deed vnder his owne hand, being then
Prince of Wales, besides the Counsell both of Spaine and of
France, treating a mariage for the Lady Mary, the one wi

Charles the Emperour, the other with Henry Duke of Orleans,
they both made a doubt whether the mariage of her mother,

                        age to be vnlawfull. Doctors, being purposely
sent to Rome about it, offered dispute before the Pope to proue
it, Cranmer in a priuate conference at Vienna with Cornelius Agrippa
(then following the Emperour, &amp; euery where admired
for his learning) so fully satisfied him that he held the proposition
most true, if it could be proued that the Lady Katherine
was carnally knowen of Prince Arthur, whereof the presumptions
were great. The one was, that Prince Henry was
deferred from his creation, and title of Prince of Wales, by the
space of sixe moneths after Arthurs decease, vpon a supposition
that the Lady Katherine might be by him conceiued with
childe: Another was that for this cause the said Lady procured
a second Bull from the Pope with this addition [Velforsan cognitam]
and peraduenture carnally knowen, which Bull was only
purchased to dispense with this mariage. A third presumption
was from the report of Prince Arthurs Chamberlaine vpon
certaine words spoken by the Prince the first morning that
he rose from his bed. A fourth was the relation of the Ambassadours
of Ferdinando her father king of Spaine, being sent hither
purposely to see the mariage consummated, who returned
their knowledge of their mutuall coniunction by the
markes, and that nothing was left vnperformed of any nuptiall
right: And surely they being both of yeeres able enough to
accomplish the acte, he aboue 15. and she aboue 17. laid both
in one bed almost fiue moneths together, doe assure vs the certainety
of that which in this businesse is made the greatest
scruple. These were the reasons which in appearance moued

                     Henry the VIII. to the remouing of his bed-fellow, not those
which you as fondly imagine, as you suggest malitiously.
I doe not take vpon me the clearing of this king from all the
blame that is cast vpon him: yet I may truely say that strangers
haue bene more fauourable vnto him, then our owne
countrey-men, he being deepely and bitterly taxed not onely
by Saunders (from whom nothing but such slanders could be
expected) but by a later writer, professing himselfe of our
owne Church, to the great content of the Romish faction,
whose obligation notwithstanding to the daughter in the censure
of wise men might deseruedly haue purchased some more
respectiue termes of the Father: whereas Thuanus the most
vnpartiall and iudicious Historiographer of our age giues this
testimonie of him, that [he was a Prince of singular naturall
indowments, and such a one in whom (had hee not too much
loosed the reines to this pleasure) you could hardly find wanting
any perfection. Nay after his diuorce from his Queene,
and from the Church of Rome, the Bishops which hee named
(sayth hee) were honest men and good Schollers, being euer
himselfe a great Patron of learning] which testimonie I the
rather alledge, because the Spanish expurgatorie index hath
rased it, as also diuers other verie memorable passages in this
Author.

of Artes, and fellow of Corpus Christi Colledge in Cambridge, I
was at last by the Statutes of that house, called to the studie of Diuinitie,

and the sauing of othermens, to looke as farre into the matter as possible
I could, that I might find out the Trueth, and hauing the opportunitie
of a very good Librarie in that Colledge: I resolued

                  After your perusing the Chronicles of England, you betake
your selfe to the reading of the Church Historie, and ancient Fathers,
and in speciall make choise of S. Augustine in whom you find
the doctrine of Rome euery where confirmed, and ours confuted:
But I would faine know whether one maine point of the doctrine
of the Church of Rome be not the Supremacie of that
Sea, and whether a chiefe feather in that wing be not Appeals
from forraine parts. Now whether S. Augustine approued
them, I appeale to his practise, being one of those Bishops in
the Councell of Carthage, who discouered and disclaimed the
impudencie and forgerie of the Church of Rome, in challenging
that as right, which some of constraint had performed, and
others of courtesie had graunted, for which himselfe with his
Fellow-Bishops were excōmunicated by the Bishop of Rome,
and (for any thing I can finde in the Church Historie) so died.
Some of his workes I haue read, specially those of Christian
doctrine, and of them I will be bold to say that they confirme
no one point of Romish doctrine controuersed at this day: and
surely there, if any where, had beene the proper place to declare
the Bishop of Rome Supreame iudge in all controuersies.

                  I haue perused your Common-place booke, written for the
most part with your owne hand, and indeed it thereby appeares
that your noting might more deseruedly bee termed a
snatching, then a gathering, though by your will you solemnely
bequeath it as a rich legacie to C.C.C. in Camb. whereof you
were a Fellow: but you found the doctrine of the Church of Rome,
(you say,) euery where confirmed by most profound demonstrations
from holy Scripture; in trueth I must confesse they are so
deepe, that throughout this treatise they are inuisible; but I
much desire to knowe by what profound demonstration from holy
Scripture, you would proue the adoration of images, the administration

of the Sacrament vnder one kinde, the exercise of
publike prayer in a language not vnderstood of the people, or
lastly the Bishop of Romes vsurpation ouer the temporals of
Princes, vnlesse you bring Bellarmines profound demonstration to
that purpose [Pasce oues meas,] or Baronius [Surge occide &amp;
manduca] or the Canonists [fecit Deus duo magna luminaria]
much like a profound demonstration I haue heard of for proofe
of the Salique law [the lillies neither labour nor spinne] therefore
the Crowne of France [ne tombe point sur laquenouille] fals not
to the distaffe: or like that of a Frier, who would needs proue
that ten worlds were made in the first Creation, and that out
of our Sauiours wordes in the Gospel [annon decem factisunt
mundi] but he was well answered by his brother in the words
following, [Sed vbisunt nouem?] and did hee not deserue the
title of D. profundus trow you, for so profound a demonstration?
                     Such a profound demonsration is that of Bellarmine out of Petrus Damianus, to shew the reason why in the Popes old Seales S. Paul was on the right hand of S. Peter, because forsooth Paul was of the tribe of Beniamin, and Beniamin signifies the sonne of the right hand, and for this he quotes Gen. 35. and 42. By such like profound demonstrations, you find the doctrine
of the Church of Rome made most agreeable to the
trueth of Christs Gospel, which for the Sacrament is,Matth. 26. 27.

is not of this world,] wordes deliuered as it seemes out of a propheticall
spirit, as foreseeing what errours should in after ages
spring vp in his Church, but you doe well to say that those doctrines
were made agreeable to this trueth: they may bee made
so, or at leastwise made to seeme so, by forging and hammering
vpon the anuill of mens conceits, howbeit in themselues they
are not so, as the belles seeme to the childe to ring that tune
which runnes in his head.

                  Being thus perplexed with my selfe what course I were best to
take, I reflected backe againe vpon the Church of England; and
because the most of those Preachers which drewe the people after
them in those dayes were Puritans, and had grounded their diuinitie
vpon Caluins institutions, I thought peraduenture that they hauing
gotten the multitude on their side, might wrong the Church of

                     England in her doctrine, as well as they desired to doe in her discipline,
which indeed vpon due search, I found to be most true: for
I found the Common prayer booke, and the Catechisme therin contained,
to hold no point of doctrine expresly contrary to Antiquitie,
but onely that it was very defectiue, and contained not enough: and
for the doctrine of I Predestination, Sacraments, Grace, Freewill,
Sinne, the new Catechisme and Sermons of those Preachers did run
wholly against the Common prayer booke, and Catechisme therein,
and did make as little account of the doctrine established by law, as
they did of the discipline: but in the one they found opposition by those
that had priuate interest, in the other they said what they list, because
no man thought himselfe K hurt.

                  If our Common prayer Booke and Catechisme therin contained,
holde no point of Doctrine contrarie to Antiquitie (as you affirme.)
Surely the Church of Rome must needs be contrary to Antiquitie,
in as much as it holds diuers points contrarie to it: If
we should beginne with the Preface, which is confirmed by
equall authoritie of State, as the bodie of the booke, it tels vs
in the verie entrance, [there was neuer any thing by the wit of
man so well deuised, or so sure established, which in continuance
of time hath not beene corrupted, as among other things
it may plainly appeare by the Common praiers in the Church,
commonly called Diuine Seruice (the reason is added a little
after,) in as much as the godly and decent orders of the Fathers
were altered and neglected, by planting in vncertaine
Stories, Legends, Responds, Verses, vaine repetitions, Commemorations,
Synodals, that commonly when any Booke of
the Bible was begunne, before three or foure Chapters were
read out, all the rest were vnread.] Another reason is there
annexed▪ [that whereas S. Paul would haue none other language
spoken to the people in the Church, then they vnderstand,
and haue profite by hearing of the same, the Seruice in
this Church of England these many yeeres hath beene read

in Latine to the people, which they vnderstand not; so that
they haue heard with their

                  Now for the bodie of the Common prayer Booke, I will
first beginne with the diuision of the Commandements▪ The

                     Rome ioyneth the two first in one, the better thereby
to cloke their Idolatrie in the worship of Images: But the
Common prayer Booke of the Church of England diuideth
them into two, therein following (two of the Fathers at most
excepted) all Antiquitie. The Church of Rome in the doctrine
of the Sacrament of the Eucharist, teacheth that we eate
and drinke the Body and Blood of Christ carnally: The Common
prayer of the Church of England in the forme of administring
that Sacrament, that wee doe both Spiritually and by
Faith feed on him in our hearts, eating and drinking in remembrance
that C H R I S T dyed and shed his Blood for vs. The
Church of Rome holdeth, that the Oblation of the Bodie of
C H R I S T is to be iterated: The Common prayer Booke of
the Church of England, that being by himselfe once offered,
hee is a full perfect and sufficient Sacrifice for the 
                        •
                     innes of the
whole world, which also meeteth with the Romish satisfaction
for Veniall sinnes, as they call them, and temporall punishment
dew to Mortall. The Church of Rome teacheth, that
the outward Sacrament of Water sufficeth to saue Infants:
The Common prayer Booke of the Church of England in the
administration of publike Baptisme, that the working of the
holy Ghost is to be ioyned thereunto. The Church of Rome
teacheth, that Laijks and Women may in some cases lawfully
Baptise: The Common prayer Booke of the Church of England
in the administration of priuate Baptisme, that none may
doe it lawfully but the lawfull Minister. The Church of Rome
teacheth, that children may bee confirmed before they come
to yeres of discretion, and are able to yeeld an account of their
Faith: The Common prayer Booke of the Church of England
in the order set downe for Confirmation, teacheth and
commandeth the contrarie. More might bee sayed to this
point, but this shall suffice to shew that if the Common prayer

Booke of the Church of England be in no point of doctrine contrarie
to Antiquitie (as M•. Doctor affirmeth) then must Antiquitie
needs bee contrarie to the doctrine of the Church of
Rome, in as much as the doctrine thereof, and our Common
prayer Booke are contrarie each to other.
                  But you further adde that though it containe no point contrarie
to Antiquitie, yet is it verie defectiue, and containeth not enough.
Indeed we confesse y• we goe not so far as the Church of Rome;
but so far as we haue warrant. We pray to God in the Name of
CHRIST, they to God &amp; to Saints. We pray for the liuing, they
for the liuing and the dead. We acknowledge 2. Sacraments,
they to those two adde fiue more. We make the Communion
of the Eucharist properly a Sacrament, they a Sacrament and
a sacrifice, and that propitiatorie. We hope to be saued by the
merits of Christ, they by his merits and their owne: the principall
ground of all these additions is, that we make Scripture
the onely rule of faith, they both Scripture and traditions:
and by mingling the water of their owne inuentions with the
wine of the Gospel, they haue made the Law of Christ of none
effect. And surely if defect may iustly bee imputed to vs, excesse
may much rather to them, who in their Pontificall spend
seuen leaues in the largest fol. onely about the benediction of
bels (which is indeed little different from Baptisme) and many
hundreds about such 
                        •
                     opperies and trifles, as wise men among
themselues cannot but laugh at, and yet dare not speake
against, and good men pitie, though they cannot remedy.
                  I I marueile what doctrine of predestination, grace, free-will,
or sinne you finde in the Common Prayer booke, or Catechisme
therein; the end of the one being not to set downe doctrinall
positions, but the exercise of religious actes, and of the other,
as briefly as may bee, to instruct children in the principles of
Christian religion, not men of riper age in the controuersies.
                  K It is to me strange, that you dare write thus to his Maiestie,
who made it knowen to the world by his pen (when other
Christian Princes and Churches were silent) that hee thought
himselfe hurt by the pestilent subtilties of Vorstius, howbeit
he were not vnder his dominions, &amp; by Legate his own subiect,

who was burnt at London for Arianisme some few yeeres
since. But surely I am clearely of opinion that his Holinesse
would take it much more to heart, and thinke himselfe more
hurt, if a Frier should preach against his power in deposing
Kings, and disposing of kingdomes, then if he denied the eternall
generation of the second person in Trinitie from the first,
or the procession of the third from the other two.

she imbraced that Religion in which shee was brought vp, being
neuer acquainted with any other, yet as his Maiesty obserueth
in his Monitorie Preface to the Christian Princes, [shee

those new opinions, which the Iesuits call Catholike.] His second
right aboue any other pre

of the second match of the sayd Ladie Margaret with
Archibald Douglas, Earle of Angush, being brought vp in Q. Elizabeths
Court, whose father the Duke of Lenox professing the
reformed religion, as well appeared by his practise in his life,
in receiuing the Sacrament after the manner of the reformed
Churches, and by the confession of his faith in the hearing of
many ministers at his death, in all likelihood his Maiesties father
himselfe should be that way affected, though Cardinall Bellarmine
vpon the relation of I know not whom, would faine haue
it otherwise. And whereas you say that schisme would faine
haue extinguished his Maiesties right, it is well knowen, that
those whom you call schismatikes, were the chiefe instruments
vnder God to preserue his Maiesties not onely right, but life;
against the fury of some, whom you call Catholikes, both before
his mothers death, and since.
                  P From his Maiesties progenitors, you come to his owne disposition
by nature▪ his amity with Catholike Princes, his speaches,
his Proclamations, which all tended at the beginning (you say) to
peace and vnitie: True indeed it is that his Maiestie by nature
is disposed to mercy, his amitie with Christian Princes argues his
charitie, and heroical ingenuitie, voide of ielousie &amp; suspition,
euen where occasiō may seem to be giuen, his speaches and Proclamations
were not bloody; yet all this could not serue your
turne, as a sufficiēt warrant to endeauor a peace with the Church
of Rome in matters of religion: no more then a league with the
great Turke for traffike should giue occasion of ioyning with
him in Mahometisme: but had you withall with the other eye
reflected a little backe vpon his Maiesties education from his
very Cradle, the choice of his aliance in mariage, his counsel to
his sonne touching the matter of religion in the first booke of
his Basilicon Doron, his exposition published vpon the 7. 8. 9.
and 10. verses of the 20. chapter of the Reuel. or lastly his subscription
to the confession of his faith, in the yeere 1581, assoon
as hee came to yeeres of discretion: you would haue had little
reason to haue presumed so farre vpon him for hearkening to
any peace with the Church of Rome,2. King. 9.

ouer the Scriptures, ouer the Church, ouer the ciuill Magistrate,
and the consciences of men, his deuilish masse, his
blasphemous Priesthood, his profane sacrifice for the quicke
and the dead, and, in a word, the erroneous and bloody decrees
of the Councel of Trent, hee promiseth and sweareth by
the great name to the Lord God, to perseuere in that faith, and
to defend it all the dayes of his life, to the vtmost of his power, vnder
paine of all the Curses contained in the Law, and the danger both
of bodie and soule, in the fearefull day of iudgement: and further
straightly chargeth and commandeth all his officers and ministers,
to make the same subscription themselues, and to take it of others
vnder their charge, and lest we should thinke that arriuing to

which was wholly for the Q peace and vnitie of the Church,
and my affection which was wholly to enjoy the R fauour of your Maiesty,
and the loue of my friends, and Countrey: this griefe of soule
now growing desperate, did still more and more increase the infirmities
of my body: and yet I was so loth to become a professed Catholike,
with the displeasure of your Maiestie, and of all my honourable
and louing friends, as I rather desired to silence my iudgement
with the profits and pleasures of the world, which was before mee,
then to satisfie it with reconciling my selfe vnto the Catholique
Church. But it was Gods will, that euer, as I was about to forget
the care of religion, and to settle my selfe to the world among my
neighbours, I met with such humours, as I saw by their violence against
Catholikes and Catholike religion, were like rather to waken
my soule by torture, then bring it asleepe by temper: and therefore
I was driven to S recoile to God and to his Church, that I might
find rest vnto my soule.

                  And yet because I had heard often, that the practise of the
Church of Rome was contrary to her doctrine, I thought good to
make one triall more, before I resolued, and therefore hauing the
aduise of diuerse learned Physitians, to goe to the Spaw for the
health of my body, I thought good to make a vertue of necessitie,
and to get leaue to goe the rather for the satisfaction of my soule,
v hoping to find some greater offence in the seruice of the Church of
Rome, then I had done in her bookes, that so I might returne better
contented, and persecute and abhorre the Catholikes at home, after
I should find them so wicked and idolatrous abroad, as they were in
euery pulpit in England affirmed to be. For this purpose before I
would frequent their Churches, I talked with such learned men as
I could meet withall, and did of purpose dispute against them, and
with all theWhat needed any great wit or learning for the iustification of that doctrine which by your owne confession holds no point expresly contrary to antiquity. wit and learning I had, both iustifie the doctrine of
England established by Law, and obiect their superstition and idolatrie,
which I thought they might commit either with the images
in the Church, or with the Sacrament of the Altar.
               
               
                  G. H.

                  That is a trueth, to auouch the practise of the Church of
Rome to be more grosse then her doctrine, (howbeit we must confesse
her doctrine, in many points, to be very grosse) appeares
by this, that the better and wiser sort among themselues, both
in their iudgements and writings, condemne many fopperies
vsually practised by the people, and winked at by their

guides: as their hallowing of graines, and medalls, and beads,
by touching some supposed Relique, with opinion of merit,
Their praying to fained Saints, and beleeuing forged legends
and miracles, Their permitting of publique Stewes, and a
Priest to keepe his concubine vnder a yeerely rent, which
Espencaeus wisheth were falsly thrust in among the grieuances
of Germany, Their setting of certaine rates vpon the most
grieuous sinnes before they bee committed, as appeareth in
their Taxa Camera, Their allowing of Sanctuaries for wilfull
murder, Their ordinary buying and selling of soules in Purgatory,
as a man would buy an horse in Smithfield, Lastly the
making of ghosts to walke and talke at their pleasure, of images
to moue, to weepe, to sweate, to speake when they list,
are matters which the modester sort dare not defend, and yet
the most impudent cannot well deny; and surely for mine
owne part I must confesse, that nothing so much mooued me
to a loathing of their religion, as the beholding of their practise,
their whole worship wherein we differ, either consisting
in apish ridiculous gestures, or in a meere outward formality,
or directed wholly to the greatnesse and gaine of the Clergy.
And I haue heard some English gentlemen affirme, that being
induced by subtilty of argument to the entertaining of some
doctrine of the Church of Rome, the sight of her whorish
countenance, and the licentious liues of her chiefe Prelates,
euen in Rome it selfe, hath wrought them to a distaste of it, as
supposing that a face so artificially painted and composed,
could not stand with simplicity of trueth, nor such lewdnesse
in liuing with soundnesse in doctrine, which Adrian the VI.
by nation a Netherlander, one of the best Popes of latter dayes,
acknowledged to be the chiefe cause of so much scandall in
the world, and so generall and eager a desire of reformation, as
appeares in his instructions to his Nuntio to bee deliuered to
the States of Germany assembled in Diet, and recorded by Espencaeus
in his Commentary on the first of Titus, and therefore
promiseth that he would begin with the reformation of his
owne Court, as our Sauiour did with the Temple: but his disposition
being discouered, and his intent knowen, order was

takē that he should not proceed in that busines, being shortly
after cut off by vntimely death. So that if you had so pleased,
you might haue found the practise of the Church of Rome much
more grosse then her doctrine, aswell for exercise of their religion,
as for the liues of their Clergie and religious men: neither
needed you to haue vndertaken a voyage to the Spaw for that
purpose, in as much as you had made, or at least, might haue
made triall therof, at your being in France with an honourable
person imployed thither by his Maiesty.
                  
                  In the last words of your Section going before this, you tel

might finde rest to your soule, and here within 10. lines you tell
vs▪ that you got leaue to trauell beyond the Seas, hoping to finde
some greater offence in the seruice of that Church, then you had
done in her bookes, in her practise, then in her doctrine: and yet
both your instances in the Section following, and conference
with learned men argue their doctrine, rather then their
practise.

                  It appeares by resting satisfied with this answere, that either
your wit and learning were very slender to obiect, hauing, as it
seemes, scarce looked into later writers, so much as to vnderstand
the state of questions controuersed betweene vs (which
notwithstanding you pretend before in your fifth Section) or
else your will forestalled by preiudice, was very apt to receiue
satisfaction with any answere. For what nouice is there so
meanely studied in Controuersies, who knowes not that the
Church of Rome hath hitherto practised, and still doth professe,
that the vse of Images in their Churches, is not onely for memorie
and representation, as you affirme, but for worship and adoration:
and withall commandeth her Pastours in that Catechisme
which they call the Romane, to teach the people so.
Nay, which is more, they both giue, and maintaine to bee due,
the same adoration to the signe of the Crosse, and neither lesse
nor more,
                        M. Hooker in his 5. booke of Ecclesiastical policie, Sect. 65. then is due vnto Christ himselfe, which opinion (as
a moderate and iudicious writer hath well obserued) howsoeeuer
they endeuour to varnish and qualifie with distinctions,
which the Schooles in speculation haue boulted out, pretending
that the Crosse, which to outward sence presenteth visibly
it selfe alone, is not by them apprehended alone, but hath
in their secret surmise or conceit, a reference to the person of
our Lord Iesus Christ; so that the honour, which they ioyntly
doe to both, respecteth principally his person, and the Crosse
but onely for his persons sake: yet the people not accustomed
to trouble their braines with so nice and subtill differences in
the exercise of religion, are apparantly no lesse insnared by adoring
the Crosse, then the Iewes by burning incense to the
Brasen serpent, and in actions of this kinde, we are more to respect
what the greatest part of men are commonly prone to
conceiue, then what some fewe mens inuention can deuise in
construction of their owne particular meanings.
                  
                     His Maiesties owne wordes to this purpose are excellent
and worthy obseruation. [But for worshipping either of them

                        sayth hee, speaking of Reliques or Images,) I must account
it damnable Idolatry, I am no Iconomachus, I quarrell not
the making of images, either for publike decoration, or mens
priuate vses: but▪ that they should be worshipped and prayed
vnto, or any holinesse attributed vnto them, was neuer
knowen of the ancients: and the Scriptures are so directly,
vehemently, and punctually against it, as I wonder what
braine of man, or suggestion of Sathan, durst offer it to
Christians: and all must be salued with nice Philosophicall
distinctions: as, Idolum nihil est, and they worship forsooth
the Images of things in being, and the Image of the true
God, but the Scripture forbiddeth to worship the image of
any thing that God created: It was not a nihil then that
God forbade onely should bee worshipped, neither was the
Brasen serpent, nor the body of Moses a nihil, and yet
the one was destroyed, and the other hidden, for eschewing
of Idolatrie: yea, the image of God himselfe is not onely expresly
forbidden to be worshipped, but euen to be made. The
reason is giuen, that no eye euer saw God: and how can wee
paint his face, when Moses, the man that euer was most familiar
with God, neuer saw but his backe parts? Surely since
hee cannot bee drawen to the view, it is a thankelesse labour
to marre it with a false representation; which no Prince,
nor scarce any other man would be contented with, in their
owne pictures. Let them therefore that maintaine this doctrine,
answere it to Christ at the latter day, when hee shall
accuse them of Idolatrie, and then I doubt, if hee will bee
payed with such nice Sophisticall distinctions.] Hitherto his
Maiestie, then which, I see not what could bee to this point
more fully and cleerely spoken.

                  13.
                  And for the blessed Sacramēt, they do not worship the Accidents
which they see, but the Substance which they beleeue: and surely if
Christ be there truely &amp; really present, (as your Maiestie seemeth
to graunt hee is) hee is as much to bee worshipped as if wee saw him
with our bodily eyes: neither is there any more Idolatry in the one
then in the other. If our blessed Sauiour himselfe should visibly appeare
in person, as hee was vpon the earth, Iewes and Infidels
would hold it for Idolatry to worship him, and would crucifie him againe,
and so would all heretikes also, who refuse to worship him in
the Sacrament where hee is really present.
               
               
                  G. H.
                  13.
                  You tell vs, that the people doe not worship the accidents which
they see, but the substance which they see not: but the question is,
whether they rightly beleeue the substance of Christs body to
lie hidden, and as it were buried vnder those Accidents? which
I am sure Saint Augustine (on whom you so much relie) is so
farre from defending, or else the adoration of Images before
mentioned, that in diuerse places hee maintaineth the cleare
contrarie to both. And to grant that after the words of Consecration
pronounced, the bodie of Christ is there folded or
kneaded vp in a bodily maner, yet whether the Priest that pronounceth
them, be rightly Ordered, and if hee be, whether hee
pronounce them with the intent that the Church intends, they
may iustly make a doubt, and consequently a question, whether
their worship bee idolatrous or no: for in such cases by
confession of all, in stead of Christs bodie, they worship the
bread: for our parts, wee constantly beleeue him to be in heauen,
and not in the bread, whereas we make a iust doubt whether
a great part of them, who beleeue him to be in the bread▪
doe with like constancie beleeue that hee is in heauen. You

further adde that if he be truely and really present (as his MAIESTIE
seemeth to graunt) he is as much to be worshipped, as if wee
saw him with our bodily eyes. But indeed it is not the seeing of
him with our bodily eyes, that makes the matter, or giues occasion
of worshipping, for then a blind man could not worship
him at all, nor a seeing man in the darke; but the beleeuing of
him to be present in a bodily manner. Wee beleeue him then
with his MAIESTIE (it being Caluins opinion expressed in
the very selfe same termes) to be truely and really present; but
in a manner Sacramentall, not bodily, and consequently not to
bee worshipped there, as being not wrapped vp vnder the accidents
of bread, but triumphing in heauen.
                  And here by your leaue how submissiuely soeuer you
would seeme in other places to carrie your selfe towards his
Maiestie, you make bold to put the title of Heretike vpon him,
and to ranke him among no better then

But our iust defence is, that after the way which you call Heresie,
we giue more true and lawfull honour to our blessed Sauiour
then you, casting all that religious worship which you giue
to the blessed Virgin, to Angels, to Saints, to the bread in the
Eucharist, to Images, to Reliques, to the Crosse▪ and all that
opinion of Merit, of Supererogation, and Satisfaction, which
you ascribe either to your selues, or others, wholy and solely
vpon him, either as God, or as Man, or as Mediatour betwixt
God and Man: onely wee denie to giue that honour to his
Image, or the bread in the Eucharist, which is as essentially
due to him, as to them vndue.

the one acknowledgeth no Supreme forreine power which

the other doth: but the Pope (you say) condemned the Powder-plot
by his Breue. I much desire to see that Breue of the Popes
which condemnes it. I suppose it is most like to be found on
the backside of Constantins donation, as an Ambassador of Venice
told the Pope touching his right to the Adriatique Sea, or
we may say of it, Breuis esse laboro obscurusfio, hee is so briefe
and obscure in it, as we can find no such matter. Two Breues
of Clements I remember I haue heard of for the withstanding
of his Maiesties entrance to the Crowne, and two others of
Paulus V. against the taking of the oath of allegiance (which
I marueile M. Doctour neuer vouchsafed so much as once to
remember through his Letter) but any against the Powder-plot,
I cannot call to minde I haue seene, or so much as heard
of. Lastly wheras you beare vs in hand, that the Popes fauourites
stand vpon none other authoritie for their Master, then such as
is spirituall and necessary for the vnity of the Church, I guesse their
meaning to be Bellarmines [indirect power in temporals, or
temporall power in ordine as spiritualia, in relation to spirituall
dueties,] which is in trueth vpon the matter, as much as can
be demanded by them, and more then must be granted by vs;
it reaching to the deposition of Princes from their thrones,
and the disposition of their Crownes, when his Holinesse shall
iudge it fit for the vnity of the Church, as well appeared in his
Buls, both against King Henry the father, and Queene Elizabeth
the daughter. And thus farre Cardinall Perron that peaceable
man, and your great Patron, expressed himselfe in the

Pope gaue him, and the rest of the Clergy, who stucke to him
in that businesse, as great thankes, as if they had saued Saint
Peters shippe from sinking: both the Cardinall and the Pope

from the fire of England.] howsoeuer sure it is they were

                  W The Church of Rome holds indeed the substance of

Christian Religion in profession, but yet by consequence
shakes the foundation of it, as it holds the death of Christ to
be satisfactory for sinne, and yet adding thereunto her owne
meritorious satisfaction consequently by the latter, she ouerthrowes
the former, for [Gal. 2. 21. 
                     If righteousnesse be by the Law, then
Christ died without a cause:] and in reason impossible it is,
if traditions be held of equall valew with the Scriptures, for
the constituting of substantiall points, but that in short time
there should ensue a substantiall alteration, and he that knowes
not that the Church of Rome holds many things now, as parts
of the Catholike faith, which it helds not in former ages,
knowes little what hath bene anciently held, or now is.
                  X If by the religion of England you vnderstand that, which
is by Law established) as in cōmon construction you cannot otherwise
be vnderstood,) you cōdemne your selfe out of your
owne mouth, in as much as you acknowledge before, that the
religion established by law in England, was the same (saue onely it
was somewhat defectiue) which now is, and euer had beene held in
the Catholike Church: and yet here you say, it hath no ground,
but the pleasure of the Prince and Parliament, wheras in trueth
we build vpon the Rocke of the Scriptures, but you vpon the
sand of traditions, and which of vs hath the sounder foundation,
I appeale no farther, then reason it selfe to iudge. You
as though you were not yet [Col. 2. 20, 21, 22 
                     dead from the ordinances of the
world, burden your selues with traditions, as touch not, taste not,
handle not, which all perish with the vsing and are after the commandements
and▪ doctrines of men: but we haue a most sure word
of the Prophets, taking heede thereto] according to S. Peters
counsell, [1. Pet. 1. 19. 
                     as to a light that shineth in a darke place,] and as our
ground is sure; so is our agreement constant, and vniforme in
all points materiall and necessary to saluation: whereas in the
building of your tower of Babel, such diuersitie of languages
is heard, that there is hardly any exposition of Scripture, or
point in controuersie, which hath not bene, or is called into
question, either directly or by consequent, by some that liued
and died in that Church, which you call Catholike, as will
easily appeare to him, who shall turne ouer the volumes of

of Cardinall Bellarmine, which is the true reason, as I suppose,
that his workes are not allowed to bee read of all, but of publike
professours, and such others as haue speciall permission
from their Superiours.

submit my selfe to the Church of Rome, I would write vnto M.
Casaubon such a letter as he might shew vnto your Maiestie,
containing such conditions as I thought might satisfie your Maiestie,
if they were performed by the Church of Rome. The copie of

were out of the like gadding humor, as you had of going into

your owne priuate charge. What his Maiesties disposition in
the affaires of religion might well bee presumed to bee at his first entrance,
if we should iudge by reason, &amp; not by affection, I haue
already touched in the 9. Section of this chapter, so far as I presumed
it might suffice to content any reasonable man: yet for
further satisfaction (because you harpe still vpō the same string,
and presse the same point afresh, I will relate his Maiesties own

                     As for mine owne profession (saith he) you haue me your
head now amongst you, of the same Religion that the bodie
is of, as I am no stranger to you in Blood, no more am I a
stranger to you in Faith, or in the matters concerning the
house of God: and although this my profession bee according
to my education, wherein I thanke God I sucked the milke
of Gods trueth with the milke of my nurse, yet doe I here
protest vnto you, that I would neuer for such a conceite of
constancie, or other preiudicate opinion, haue so firmely kept
my first profession, if I had not found it agreeable to all reason,

and to the rule of my conscience: and againe in the
next leafe, for the part of the Clerickes, I must directly say
and affirme, that as long as they maintaine one speciall
point of their doctrine, and another point of their practise,
they are no way sufferable to remaine in this Kingdome.
Their point of Doctrine is, that arrogant and ambitious Supremacie
of their he
                        ••
                      the Pope, wherby he not only claimes
to be spirituall head of all Christians, but also to haue an Imperiall
ciuill power ouer all Kings and Emperours, dethroning,
and decrowning Princes with his foot as pleaseth him,
and dispensing and disposing of all Kingdomes and Empires
at his appetite. The other point which they obserue in continuall
practise is, the Assassinates and Murders of Kings,
thinking it no sinne; but rather a matter of saluation to
doe all actions of rebellion and hostilitie against their Soueraigne
Lord, if he be once our sed, his Subiects discharged of
their fidelitie, and his Kingdome giuen a prey by that three
Crowned Monarch, or rather Monster their head, and a litle
after, hauing wished it would please God to make him
one of the instruments for effecting a generall Christian
Vnion in Religion, if they would leaue and be ashamed
of such new and grosse corruptions of theirs, as themselues
cannot maintaine nor denie to be worthy of reformation, he
turneth his speach againe to the Papists vnder his dominions,
willing them to bee admonished, that they presume
not too farre vpon his lenitie, because (saith hee) I
would be lothe to bee thought a Persecutor, as thereupon to
thinke it lawfull for them daily to increase their number
and strength in this Kingdome, whereby if not in my time,
at least in time of my posteritie, they might bee in hope to erect
their Religion againe. No let them assure themselues,
that as I am a friend to their persons, if they bee good Subiects,
so am I a vowed enemie, and doe denounce mo

warres to their errours, and that as I would bee sorie to bee
driuen by their ill behauiour from the protection and conseruation
of their bodies and liues, so I will neuer cease as
farre as I can, to tread downe their errours and wrong opinions:
for I could not permit the increase and growing of
their Religion, without first betraying of my selfe and mine
owne Conscience, secondly, this whole Isle, aswell the part I
am come from, as the part I remaine in, in betraying their liberties,
and reducing them to the former slauish yoke, which
both had casten off, before I came amongst them: and thirdly
the libertie of the Crowne in my posteritie, which I should
leaue againe vnder a new slauerie, hauing found it left free
to mee by my Predecessours, and therefore would I wish all
good Subiects, that are deceiued with that corruption: First,
if they find any beginning of instinction in themselues of
knowledge and loue to the Trueth, to foster the same by all
lawfull meanes, and to beware of quenching the spirit that
worketh within them; and if they can find as yet no motion
tending that way, to bee studious to reade and conferre
with learned men, and to vse al such meanes as may further
their resolution, assuring themselues (which by the way
is worth our obseruation) that as long as they are disconformable
in Religion from vs, they cannot be but halfe my
Subiects, nor be able to do but halfe seruice, and I to want the
best halfe of them, which is their soules. And here I haue
occasion to speake to you my Lords the Bishops; for as you my
Lord of Durham said very learnedly to day in your Sermon;
Correction without instruction is but a tyrannie, so
ought you and all the Clergie vnder you to be more carefull,
vigilant, and diligent then you haue beene to winne soules to
God, aswell by your exemplarie life, as doctrine. And since
you see how carefull they are, sparing neither labour, paines,
nor extreme perill of their persons to diuert (the deuill is so

busie a Bishop) you should be the more carefull and wakefull
in your charges. Follow the rule prescribed by Saint Paul,
Bee carefull to instruct and to exhort, in season and
out of season: and where you haue beene any way sluggish
before, now waken your selues vp with a new diligence in
this point, remitting the successe to God, who calling them
at the second, third, tenth, or twelfth houre, as they are alike
welcome to him, so shall they be to me his lieutenant here.
                        •
                     
                     Hitherto his Maiestie. Now would any man of common vnderstanding
(Mr. Dr. excepted) from hence gather, or thinke
it gatherable, that his Maiestie had a disposition at his entrance
to become a Papist, or to tolerate the exercise of Poperie, or to
be reconciled to Rome, or to submit himselfe and his Realmes
to the yoke of the Bishop thereof? if these or the like inferences
may from so many and plaine words, so many and forcible
arguments to the contrarie, be deduced, I must confesse I
know not what belongs to Logike: and for other passages in
the same speech, which seeme to fauour your cause, you must
either iniuriously wrest them from the authors meaning, or
make them by reasonable construction sutable to these.
                  
                  Howsoeuer, your selfe being a Churchman, and one of those
whom he sharpely taxeth, [for changing their coats through curiositie,
affectation of noueltie, or discontentment in their priuate humours,]
cannot possibly be ranked amongst them [to whom as
to minds only retaining the liquor they first dranke in, out of his speciall
clemencie he proposeth more fauourable conditions] and yet
among these too, he hath since discouered an vnnaturall disposition,
whom he hoped to find by moderate &amp; gentle vsage, in the matter of
naturall subiection, quiet and well minded men,] and therefore no
marueile if his Maiestie be since more exasperated, and farther off
from any reconciliation with that Religion then before. But
Mr. 
                     Casaubon, you say, tolde you that his errand hither was nothing
else, but to mediate peace betweene the Church of Rome,
and the Church of England. It is certainely false that Mr.
                     Casaubons errand was by his Maiestie intended to b
                        •
                      such,
and most vnlikely to be true, that it was by Mr 
                     Casaubon so reported

to you, considering his direct and expresse writings,
both before his comming ouer, and since, against the chiefe
Patrons and controuersed points of the Church of Rome,
and among the rest, in the conclusion of his Epistle to
Cardinall Perron, where hee assures him from his Maiesties,
mouth, and in his name, [that his constant purpose and full resolution
was, as long as the Church of Rome yeelded not to antiquity
and trueth, to entertaine no society with her at all, which you
might haue read before your departure, and spared the paines
of writing to M. Casaubon, whome that I may yet more fully
cleare from this imputation, being not able now to speake for
himselfe, I will here set downe his Letter, written with his
owne hand to my Lords Grace of Canterbury, vpon this very
occasion, in which hee termes the report no better then the
slander of a wicked Apostate.

liued, both before I came into this Kingdome,
and since I came into England, that I ought
not to care what a forlorne Apostate pratleth,
or writeth of me. It appeares he is very angry
with me for a letter I wrote him, to reclaime
him from that mad course: thereupon he goes
about to traduce me to the KINGS MAIESTY
and your Grace. But I hope better both of that
most wise KING, and of you most renowned
Prelate. Vnto whom if I thought there were
need of Apologie, I would, laying all other
things aside, in person purge my selfe vnto
your Grace. But my case, I trust, is not so vnhappy,
that the slanders of a lewd Apostate
should be of any force with you against my reputation.
If you command, I will forthwith
repaire vnto you, and satisfie your Grace vnto

him many reasons why I certainely beleeued,
it was folly, or rather frensie to hope for any
good from the Romish Phalaris, (for that very

be any amongst vs. I laid before his eyes how
auerse the Peeres of the Romish Church are
from all equitie: specially Bellarmine, of whose
impiety I wrote at large vnto him. I set before
his eyes with how great danger to himselfe he
seemed to become the Popes Patron. I alledged
testimonies of Matthew Paris of the great
misery of England when it was vnder the
Popes obedience. I added the example of that
Narbonois, who of late sent vnto the Kings
MAIESTY a booke of the like argument:

                  There is a statute in England made by King Henry the VIII.
to make him supreame head of the Church in spirituall and Ecclesiasticall
causes, which Statute enioynes all the subiects of England,
on paine of death, to beleeue and to sweare they doe beleeue that it is
true: and yet all the world knowes, if King Henry the VIII. could
haue gotten the Pope to diuorce Queene Katherine, that he might
marrie Anne Bullen, that Statute had neuer been made by him:
and if that title had not enabled the King to pull downe Abbeys,

and religious houses, and giue them to Lay men, the Lords and
Commons of that time would neuer haue suffered such a Statute to
be made. This Statute was continued by Queene Elizabeth to
serue her owne turne, and it is confirmed by your Maiestie to satisfie
other men, and yet your Maiestie yeeldeth the Church of Rome to

Christian man can take that oath with a
safe conscience, neither will I euer take it to gaine the greatest preferment
in the world.

                  The Statute, here intended, can be none other, then the
S
                           •
                        tute 26. of H. VIII. Cap. 1. for that is the first Statute that
medleth with the Supremacie; which Statute is, as the Common
Lawyers terme it, Statutum declaratiuum, not introductiuum
noui iuris: as doth clearely appeare by the Preamble,
which hath these words: [Albeit the Kings Maiestie iustly and
rightfully is and ought to bee taken and accepted supreame head of
the Church of England, and so is recognized by the Clergie in
their Conuocation, yet neuerthelesse for corroboration and confirmation
thereof, Be it enacted, that the King shall bee taken, and accepted
Supreme head, &amp;c.] So that the Doctor is fowly mistaken
to say that there was a Statute made by K. Henry the VIII.

                     to make him Supreme head: for it was his ancient right that
made him so, and it was his Clergie that had acknowledged
him to be so, before the making of this Stat
                           •
                        te; nay the very
phrase and letter of this Statute it selfe doeth purposely renounce
the power of making, and assumes onely the authority
of confirming.
                  Whereby it is cleare that Henrie VIII. made not a statute
to make himselfe Supreme in Ecclesiasticall causes, as Mr.
Doctor affirmeth; but to confirme those Statutes and Rights,
which his noble Progenitors as iu
                        •
                     tly challenged to belong to
their Crown, as the Bishops of Rome vniustly pretended to be
annexed to their Myter. And where he sayes, that the Statute
which (according to his vnderstanding made him Supreme
head) did also enioyne the Subiect to beleeue and sweare it t
                           •
                         bee
true, it is manifest, that there is not any mention at all of any
oath in that Statute: but it is true indeede, that in the 28. of
Henry VIII. chap. 10. there is an oath of Supremacie ordeined,
the refusall whereof by some certaine persons enioyned by
that Act to take it, was made high Treason. And herein againe
is the Doctour deceiued, nay which is worse seeketh to
deceiue others; for onely some certaine persons were bound
by that Statute to take the oath, and not all the Subiects of England,
as he falsely surmiseth. Anno 35. Henry VIII. cap. 1. the
oath of Supremacie ordeined by 28. was repealed, and a new
forme of oath prescribed and extended to more persons, but
neuer to all in generall. The same Parliament Cap. 3. enioyneth
that the stile of Supreme head be receiued and vsed, and
this was all that was done by Henry VIII. in the point of Supremacie
by way of Statute: So that to say as Master Doctor
doth, that all the Subiects in England are bound vpon paine of
death to beleeue the Supremacie, is a malicious fiction in two
respects: First touching the persons enioyned to take the
oath, and lyable to the punishment; and then againe as touching
the offence, for that beliefe alone, which is a secret inclination
of the minde knowne onely to God, the searcher of
the heart, and not issuable nor tryable by any Law humane,
should be made an offence punishable by death; is in it selfe so

absurde, as it cannot but appeare to bee a false imputation to
charge our Law-makers therewithall. Lastly, whereas hee
sayes that Henry the VIII. would neuer haue made that Statute, if
he could haue gotten the Pope to haue diuorced Queene Katherine
that he might haue married Anne Boleine it is cleare, and all the
world may know, that if King Henry would haue ioyned with
Francis the French King in the warre of Naples against Charles
the Emperour, the Pope would not haue stucke to haue giuen
way to that diuorce: for the better procuring of which Combination
hee did not onely referre this Matrimoniall cause to
the hearing and determining of his Legates: but gaue Campeius
a secret Bull in his bosom, as witnesseth

in such Matrimonie without sinne:) whereupon hee decreed that
after the delaration of the nullitie of the former mariage, and
the Kings absolution, it should bee lawfull for him to marrie
another. This Bull he forbad him to shew to any, saue onely
to the King and Cardinall Wolsey, his fellow Commissioner in
that businesse: and though openly he commanded him to handle
the cause with all expedition, yet secretly hee willed him
to protract the time, promising that himselfe would watch
an opportunitie to publish the Decree; so the King and
Queene were cited to appeare before them in May following,
at which time after some debating of the cause, they protracted
the sentence till the beginning of August, and after many
delayes, finding that King Henry could not by hope of the diuorce
bee drawen to side with the French, the Pope commanded
Campeius to burne his Bull, and to returne home: whereby
it appeares that King Henry might easily haue had the nullitie
of his mariage with Queene Katherine ratified at Rome,
without taking the title of Supreme head, if hee would haue

yeelded to the Popes conditions. But the Lords, you say, and
Commons would neuer haue suffered such a Stat
                           •
                        te to bee made,
had not that title inabled the King to pull downe Abbeys and Religious
houses and giue them to Lay men. I would faine know
then what mooued the Bishops to giue way to it, who had
no share in that diuision, yet had they with the consent of the
Clergie, passed it in Conuocation, before it was so much as
proposed in Parliament, and for the Commons a very little
share fell out to their parts. And if 
                        
                           •
                        he assuming of that title
were indeed so needfull (as you pretend) for the supressing of those
houses: by what authoritie did Cardinall Wolsey dissolue some,
and the King by his example more, before that title was by
him publikely assumed?
                  Now for Queene Elizabeth, it is true that she reuiued those
Statutes of Supremacie enacted by her father, and repealed by her
sister, but not without diuers exceptions, as may appeare by
the bookes; in so much as a new forme of Oath was established
by her, which is the Oath at this day in force, the refusall
of which vpon a second offering by such as stand conuicted
of a former refusall, is by the Statute of 5• 
                     Eliz. cap. 1.
made high Treason, and it is none otherwise. Nay further, by
an expresse prouiso in that Statute, none are compellable to
take the Oath the second time but Ecclesiasticall persons, and
some few others, especially named in that Statute, neither
doth shee take to her in that or any other Statute the title of
Supreme head, but of Gouernour, by which what shee vnderstood,
herselfe expressed in her Iniunctions, and her Clergie in
their 37. Article confirmedIn the yeere 1562. and againe in 1571. in two seuerall Conuocations,
where they thus speake, [Where wee attribute to the Queenes
Maiestie the chiefe Gouernment, by which title we vnderstand the
mindes of some slanderous folkes to be offended, wee giue not to our
Princes the ministring either of Gods word, or of the Sacraments,
the which thing the Iniunctions also lately set foorth by Elizabeth
our Queene, doe most plainely testifie: but that onely prerogatiue
which we see to haue beene giuen alwayes to all godly Princes in holy
Scripture by God himselfe, that is, th

and degrees committed to their charge by God, whether they be Ecclesiasticall

or Temporall, and restraine with the ciuill sword, the
stubburne and euill doers,] neither doe I see how Osorius in his
Epistle to her can be interpreted to affoord her lesse, where he
professeth, that all Kings are Pro parte suaiuris diuini Vicarij,
Vicars of Gods Law in their places.
                  
                  
                     From Queene Elizabeth you passe to his Maiestie, and tell
him, that he confirmed the same Statute to satisfie other men, arguing
therein his Maiestie of great weakenesse, either as being
not able to iudge what he did, or as being caried by others
against his owne iudgement. But that his MAIESTIE did

Crowne of England, and since himselfe with his owne penne

things, for that purpose, which is the onely intent of the Oath of

of Rome to be the Mother Church, and the Bishop of Rome to bee
the chiefe Bishop or Primate of the Westerne Churches.

the Romane Church to be our Mother Church, this M. Doctour

is content to vrge, but to conceale that which he addeth, [defiled
with infirmities and corruptions, as the Iewes were when they
crucified Christ, and as I am none enemy (saith he) to the life of a
sicke man, because I would haue his body purged of ill humours;
no more am I an enemy to their Church, because I would haue
them reforme their errours, not wishing their throwing out of the
Temple, but that it might be purged and clensed from corruption,
otherwise how can they wish vs to enter, if their house bee not first
made cleane?] Herein Mr Doctour dealing with his Maiesty,
as the deuill did with our Sauiour, hee pressed that out of the
Psalme which made for himselfe [Psal. 91, 11. Hee will giue his Angels
charge ouer thee] but suppressed that which made against him
[to keepe thee in all thy wayes] now if any man farther desire his
Maiesties meaning in calling Rome the Mother Church, hee
hath fully expressed himselfe in his Premonition, [Patriarchs
(saith he) I know were in the time of the Primitiue Church, and
I likewise reuerence that institution for orders sake: and amongst
them was a contention for the first place. And for my selfe (if that
were yet the question) I would with all mine heart giue my consent
that the Bishop of Rome should haue the first seat, I being a Westerne
King would goe with the Patriarch of the West] whereby
it is cleare that his Maiesties meaning was, and is, to yeeld the
Bishop of Rome ouer other Westerne Bishops, (in case they

                     precedency in order, not a
supremacie in power, and iurisdiction, it beeing the marke
which Mr. Doctour driues at, and from thence labours cunningly
but malitiously to inferre, contrary to his Maiesties
both minde, and words. I conclude this point with a Reuerend

                  18.
                  The Statute intended is the 27. of Eliz. Cap. 2. which indeed,
in the body thereof, hath words sounding to that purpose;
but the sense is malitiously peruerted, and the inference
thereupon; for he that shall reade through that Statute, and
consider all the parts, shall clearely perceiue, that therby none
other Priests are intended then Popish Priests, made and ordeined
by Popish Bishops, and not such as Mr. Doctour was, made in
England by any of our Bishops here: Though perhaps it were
true, that our Bishops did deriue their first authority from Gregory
(which we do not yeeld vnto,) considering that Augustine
from whom they are pretended to deriue it, was not consecrated
by him, but by Aetherius Archbishop of Arles, (if wee
may beleeue our own Venerable Bede) for the title of the Statute
is, An Acte against Iesuites, Seminary Priests, and such other

like disobedient persons, and the preamble of the acte hath
these words, [Whereas diuers persons, called or professed Iesuites,
Seminary Priests, and other Priests, which haue beene, and fro

to the order and rites of the Romish Church, haue of late yeeres
commen, and bene sent into England, &amp;c.] So that if according
to the rule [Praefatio est clauis Statuti,] we shall interprete the
body by the title, or preamble, howsoeuer the wordes in the
body of the acte bee somewhat generall, yet what Priests are
intended by the Law-makers, is euident enough; and except
M. Doctour were a Priest according to the Order and Rites of
the Romish Church, by shauing, anoynting, and imposition of
hands by a Popish Bishop, and that since the first yeere of
Queene Elizabeth, he needed not to haue feared the danger
of the Law.

                  There is another Statute in like maner made and confirmed, that
it is death to bee reconciled by a Catholike Priest to the Church of
Rome, I am perswaded that the Church of Rome is our mother
Church, and that no man in England can be saued, that continues
wilfully out of the visible vnitie of that Church, and therefore I can
not chuse, but perswade the people to be reconciled thereunto if possibly
they may.

and is not distinct from that following, but are both one,

recites that [whereas diuers ill affected persons haue practised

withdrawing of the Subiect from their naturall obedience, or
for that intent, from the religion established, is the offence made
treason, and not simple exhorting to the Romish religion, as is alleadged:
And yet to speake a trueth, I see not how any exhortation
to an absolute submission of the vnderstanding and the
will to the Bishop of Romes Iurisdiction, which now is made
the onely essentiall forme of that religion, can well be seuered
from such an intent. But Rome (you say) is the mother Church,
and no man in England can bee saued, that continues wilfully out of
the visible vnitie of that Church. Where if you terme it the mother
Church in that sense that his MAIESTIE doeth, wee imbrace
it; but if your meaning bee, that shee is our mother, either
in regard that wee receiued the first life, or still should receiue
the nourishment of religion from her, wee denie it; our nation
being first conuerted to the Christian faith by Ioseph of Arimathea,
who intombed the Corps of our Sauiour, and lieth
himselfe interred at Glastenbury, together with twelue disciples
his assistants, where they first preached the Gospel, as Gildas
affirmeth in the life of Aurelius Ambrosius, and Malmesbury
in the Booke, intituled, The Antiquitie of Glastenbury,
written to Henry of Bloys, brother to King Steuen, and Abbot
of the same place; and it is consented vnto by the learned Antiquaries
of later times, as namely, Mr. Cambden, Iohn Bale,
Matthew Parker, Polydore Virgil, and others, grounding themselues
vpon the authoritie of the best approued, and most ancient
writers: and withall considering our keeping of Easter,
and other Ceremonies were after the fashion of the Easterne
Church, and not of the Westerne, at the comming of Austin.
I may very well coniecture that our first conuersion to Christian
religion was from the Iewes, or Grecians, and not from
the Romanes: so that if Rome bee rightly

at last into the reiectiō of the Iewes, for their vnbeliefe he warneth

the branches, and if thou boast thy selfe, thou bearest not the
roote, but the roote thee. Thou wilt say, the branches were broken off,
that I might be graft in, well: through infidelity they are broken off,
and thou standest by faith: be not high minded, but feare. For if
God spared not the naturall branches, take heed lest he spare not thee.
Behold therefore the goodnesse and seuerity of God: toward them
which haue fallen, seueritie; but towards thee goodnesse, if thou
continue in his goodnesse; otherwise thou also shalt bee cut off.]
Now whether the Apostle spake generally to the Gentiles, and
inclusiuely to the Romanes, or namely to the Romanes, and
proportionably to the rest, it is all one to vs, one of the twaine
he must needs. Origen saith vpon these words of Paul, [I say
to you Gentiles.] Now hee plainely turneth his speach to the Gentiles,
but chiefly to those of the citie of Rome that beleeued S. Paul.]
speaking then to the Romanes, no man may except the Romans,
and they being included, his admonition to them, if there
could bee no danger in them of swaruing from the faith, was
vtterly superfluous, and the condition implied ridic

the commination odious, and the reason friuolous. Now that
which S. Paul there threatned, we find come to passe; so that
we cannot, we dare not ioyne hands with her; nay wee are so
farre from beleeuing, that none can bee saued, that continues
out of the visible vnitie of that Church: that on the other side,
we cōstantly beleeue, that the means to be saued, is to separate
our selues from the vnity of that Church, till she separate her
selfe from her errors, specially since in your vnderstanding, the
continuing in the visible vnity of that Church, is in a manner
nothing else, but the acknowledging of the Bishop of Rome
to bee the visible head of it: and if none can bee saued without

that, what shall become of your honest brethren of the English
Clergie? whom you professe you are so farre from condemning,
as you doe account your selfe one of them? what of
so many millions of soules in the Easterne and Westerne
Christian Churches, more in number by many degrees, then
those that yet continue in that visible vnitie, and better both in
life and beliefe, then those who acknowledge it, or the visible
head himselfe of it.

                  There is another Statute in like manner made and confirmed,
that it is death to exhort the people of England to Catholike religion,
I am perswaded that the religion prescribed and practised
by the Church of Rome is the true Catholike religion which
I will particularly iustifie from point to point, if God giue time and
opportunitie, and therefore I can not choose but perswade the people
thereunto.

                  For the Statute here pretended, I haue already answered
that it is none other then a branch of the former: And for your
promise of iustifying from point to point the religion prescribed
and practised by the Church of Rome, if it be performed,
when wee shall see it published, I doubt not but a Confutation
will be found as particular and plaine, and more true, then your
Iustification: but in the meane time, I cannot but wonder
what you can say more herein then hath often been sayd by as
earnest, and more learned Proctors of that Church then your
selfe▪ Besides, how comes it to passe you should be suddenly
expert, and so peremptorily confident in all the controuersed
points, except you were resolued in most of them before your
parting hence: I remember Duke Humfrey discouered a notable
piece of knauery in a beggar, who pretending blindnesse

the recouery of his sight; this your vaine offer to iustifie all
points in controuersie presently vpon your breathing of outlandish
ayre, cannot but giue vs iust occasiō to suspect the like
hyopocrisie. Lastly, if the religion prescribed and practised
by the Church of Rome be in all points the only true religion,
why would his holinesse permit the exercise of ours with little,
or no alteration, as afterward you beare vs in hand, vpon
conditions his MAIESTIE, on the other side, would admit of
his supremacie, and the Masse.

his life is in no danger by the Law, if he breake not out into

for the Catholike Religion, and (vnhappie man!) had beene acquainted
with nothing else, but that which was reuealed mee in
Confession, I might perhaps seeme not vnworthy the honor of Martyrdome,
and merite the iudgement of the Church: but now as the
case stands, I must acknowledge my fault, and confesse the sentence
of death pronounced against me most iust; Then againe doubling
and trebling his sighes, and shewing tokens of vnfained sorrow,
I would to God (sayeth he) what is done, might be vndone,
I could wish that any other chance had befallen me, rather then my
name should thus be stained with the blot of Treason, which offence,
though most grieuous, yet I distrust not, but it may be washed away
with the teares of repentance, and that Christ will haue mercie on
me. Sure I am, that if I had all the world in my power to bestow, I
would willingly giue all, that I might be freed from the guilt and
imputation of treason, which lies heauie vpon my conscience, &amp; shall

all this, is hee recorded a Martyr, apologized by Eudemon, and by Delrio paralelled with Denis the Areopagite. What

1580. came couertly into England, in the company of Robert
Parsons, with a Facultie obtained of Gregorie the XIII. conceiued
in these very words.

                  Let Petition bee made to our highest Lord
that some explication be made of the declaratorie
Bull of Pius Quintus against ELIZABETH
and her adherents, which the Catholikes desire
so to be vnderstood, that it may bind her,
and heretikes, but Catholikes by no meanes,
as the case now stands, but then onely, when the
said Bull may publikely be put in execution. These
Faculties the Highest Bishop granted to Robert
Parsons and Edmund Campian, being bound for
England, the 14. of April 1580, in the presence
of Oliuer Manacar, Assistant.
                  Here againe I would demaund of Mr. Dr, how many of the
Romish profession are ready to sweare solemnely (as the olde
Romans did in the Deifying of their Emperours) that hee is
now a Saint, and that hee died a glorious Martyr, not for treason
but for religion? But were not Harte, and Horton, Rishton,
and Bosgraue of the same religion, Priests by their order, and
some of the same societie, and yet died not for it? Are there not
at this present diuers Seminary Priests at Wisbich, and Baldwin
the famous Iesuite in the Tower? Certainely if there bee any
fault in their vsage, it is, that they find too much mercie, their
mercilesse disposition toward vs hauing so lately, so fully, and
so often been tried. I will conclude this point with a case of
conscience wherwith your Romish Priests were to arme themselues
&amp; their disciples in the reigne of Q. ELIZABETH, in case
they should be apprehended, and examined to the 55. Article,
when th
                        •
                      question is demaunded, Whether notwithstanding the
Bull of Pius the 5th, that was giuen out, or any Bull that the Bishop

of Rome can hereafter giue foorth, all Catholikes bee bound to
yeeld obedience, faith and loyaltie to Queene ELIZABETH, as
to their lawfull Prince and Soueraigne, this resolution is framed:

fidem spectat, &amp; exigit confessionem fidei.
                  
                  
                     Hee that demandeth this question, asketh in effect, Whether
the Pope might doe it or no? to the which demaund, what a
Catholike ought to answere, it is plainer, then neede here be further
expressed; if therefore a Catholike bee asked, Doe you beleeue the
Bishop of Rome may depriue Queene ELIZABETH of her
Crowne? hee must answere, not regarding any danger of death, I
beleeue hee may, for this question is a point of faith, and requireth
the profession of our faith.

                     MY first hope is, that your Maiesty will accept of that
for the best A seruice I can doe you, which doth most
further the glory of our blessed Sauiour, and mine
owne saluation. B Indeed there are kingdomes in
the world, where the chiefe care of the gouernour
is, non quàm bonis praesit, sed quàm subditis. Such were the
heathen kingdomes, which S. Augustine describes in 2. de Ciuitate
Dei, Cap. 20. In such Common wealths the way to beI suppose your meaning is to be accounted so. a good

that (asI haue not met with any that teacheth it but holy Father Aristotle, in the entrance of his Politikes. some holy and learned Fathers teach) in a well ordered
gouernment there is eadem foelicitas vnius hominis, ac totius ciuitatis,

bound in duety to respect and seeke for those things aboue all other,
that may aduance the honour of God, and the saluation of my owne
soule, and the soules of those which do any way belong to my charge.

And being sufficiently resolued that nothing can more aduance
the honour of our Sauiour, and the common saluation, then to be
in the vnity of his Church, I haue done you the best seruice I
could at home, by preaching peace and reconciliation; and being
not able for theThat which you call the malice of the times was the iust censure of your superiours procured by your own malice against the trueth. malice of the times to stand any longer in the breach

                  A In furthering the glory of God, you shall doe others as
much, and in sauing your owne soule, your selfe more seruice, then
his Maiesty: but if you pretend both, and in the end performe
neither, it is the worst piece of seruice you can doe.
                  B I suppose there is no gouernour in the world (who deserues
that name) but that a chiefe part of his care is, to make
his subiects at leastwise morally good, that so he may find them
the more obedient, and some of those very heathen kingdoms,
which S. Augustine describes in his bookes of the city of God, specially
that of the Romanes, yeelded more rare examples of morall
goodnesse, namely of iustice and temperance, then it doth
at this day, though it professe Christ. And for the seruing of the
times and turnes of those that beare the sway, I doubt not but as
many may be found in those kingdomes which you call Catholike,
who are as able and willing to doe it for their owne aduantage,
as amongst the heathen themselues.
                  C It is true that the happinesse of the whole State extends to
euery particular member of the same, in as much as they all belong
to the same body: but that the happinesse of euery particular
member, should reach to the whole body of the State, is not alike
certaine. But to grant both, I must confesse my dulnesse,

I conceiue not how from thence it followes, that the vertue of
a good man and a good citizen is alwayes and necessarily the same.

my iudgement truely obserues, [that the best men for the most
part are the worst Statesmen, in as much as being caried vp to heauen
by contemplation, they shunne societie, and seeke out deserts and
solitary places for their abode.] And I would faine know of your
Monkes, and Friers, and Hermites, and Anchorites, who presume
by their vertue and goodnesse, not onely to merite for
themselues, but to supererogate for others, what good they doe
as members for the Common wealth, but onely by meanes of that
imaginary Supererogation, which is no lesse hard for a wise
man to beleeue, then for a good to performe. But to let passe
the examination of the trueth of both those positions, and the
dependance of the later vpon the former, your inference therupon
to iustifie your selfe and your owne proceedings, is both
in it selfe more vntrue, and in regard of the premises more
loose and inconsequent; in as much as by leauing your station,
and betaking your selfe vnto, and consulting with the enemies
of his Maiesty and the State, for the ruine and destruction of
both, (which you maske vnder the glorious titles of honour of
our Sauiour, common saluation, vnity, peace, reconciliation, seruice
to his Maiesty, good of his kingdome,) you neither performe the
part of a good Common wealths man, not yet of an honest man, &amp;
consequently indanger (as farre as in you lieth) not onely the
happinesse of the State in which you liued, &amp; Church in which
you were baptized, but of your owne together with them:
but aboue all a marueile it is, that acknowledging your selfe a
member of the Church of Rome, you notwithstanding still professe

                  The deuill howbeit he be rather a Polititian, then of any other
profession, yet when he came to tempt our LORD tooke
vpon him the habite of a Diuine: but you in tempting the
LORDS annointed, lay aside the habite of a Diuine, and wholy
take vpon you the person of a Polititian: But herein if I
should tell you, you played Phormioes part before Hannibal,
you would thinke your deepe Policie much impeached. Now
as you differ from the Deuill in that he turned himselfe in appearance
into an Angel of light, being indeede a Spirit of
darkenesse, but you being an Angel in profession, turne your
selfe into a tempter: so in this you both agree, as if you had
learned your methode from him, and proposed him as your

patterne, that as hee being beaten from Scripture, betooke
himselfe (as being his last refuge) to the shewing of the kingdomes
of the world, and the glorie of them to our Sauiour,
promising him all, if hee would but fall downe and worship;
so you perceiuing belike all other arguments to bee spent in
vaine, at length you purpose to try what vse may bee made of
the deuils last motiue, by promising his Maiestie all worldly honor
and securitie for himselfe and his posteritie, if he would but fall
downe and worship your Lord the Pope: but as the deuil promised
that which was none of his to giue; so doth your Lord
too, in the disposing of those kingdoms, and the glory of them
which no way belong vnto him, except it bee by the title of
being heire apparent to the god of this world, and the prince
that ruleth in the aire: but were it not for feare of interrupting
of your deepe and serious meditations, I should make
bold to put you to the question, whether these were the baits
that Saint Peter angled with to catch soules, or the weapons
that Saint Paul fought with when he professed, that they were
not carnall, but mightie through God to cast downe holdes:
they proposed not honour and securitie to the disciples of
CHRIST, but hazard and basenesse.
                  I insist the longer vpon this argument because the whole
following discourse is stuffed with nothing else but reasons of
this nature, as if in the profession of Religion, not the sinceritie
and trueth of it were so much to be regarded, as those secular
and temporall commodities which sometimes attend it, as
the shadow doth the bodie. His Maiesties owne words to his
sonne of fresh &amp; blessed memorie touching this point are most
remarkeable, worthy to be written in letters of gold, and to be
ingrauen in a pillar of brasse or marble. [If (sayeth he) my
conscience had not resolued mee; that all my Religion presently
professed by mee and my Kingdomes, was grounded vpon the
plaine words of the Scripture, without the which all points of Religion
are superfluous, as any thing contray to the same is abomination,
I had neuer outwardly auowed it for pleasure or awe of any flesh.]
                  
                  I take his meaning to be either for loue, or feare of any mortall
man, or rather for any worldly and fleshly consideration,

whether it were to gaine and make aduantage by entertaining
and embracing it, or to loose and suffer disaduantage by reiecting
and opposing the contrary.
                  I speake not this as if (by Gods grace) as much and more,
both honour and securitie did not waite vpon our Religion as
vpon the Romish, but onely to shew that these are no sufficient
inducements to draw so much as a priuate man, much lesse
to mooue the diuine and noble spirit of a Christian prince,
(specially such a prince as hath often shewed himselfe able to
iudge of reasons of a higher straine) to the accepting of a new
beliefe, and another forme in the seruice of God, but only the
plaine demonstration and cleare euidence of the truth of that
beliefe and necessitie of that forme.

                  The first reason of my hope is, the promise of God himselfe to
blesse and honour those that blesseAll this must be vnderstood of the Church of Rome, which first curseth, and then by all meanes laboureth to confound such as oppose against her, imputing her owne deuillish plots to Gods working. his Church, and honour him,
and to curse and confound those that curse his Church and dishonor
him; which hee hath made good in all ages. There was neuer any
man, or Citie, or State, or Empire so preserued and aduanced, as
they that haue preserued the vnitie and aduanced the prosperitie
of the Church of Christ, nor any been made more miserable and inglorious
then they that haue dishonoured Christ, and make hauocke
of his Church by Schisme and heresie.

                  To grant that which you assume, that the Church of Rome
is the onely true Church; this argument drawen from temporall
blessings is sometimes false, vncertaine alwayes: and your assertion,
that neuer any man, or Citie, or State was preserued &amp; aduanced,
as they that haue pres

                        rued the vnitie, and aduanced the
prosperitie of the Church of Christ, is very broad and too large,

considering it extends euen to Solomon himselfe, who though
hee aduanced the Church, yet can it not properly bee said that
hee aduanced the Church of Christ, nay out of the Church
who were euer more prosperous &amp; succesfull in their affaires,
then Augustus and Traian? Of the former of whom it is said,
that he found Rome of Bricke, and left it of Marble: of the later
that hee raised the Romane Empire to the highest pitch of
glory, and spread the power of their Command vnto the farthest
borders, and largest circuit that euer before or since hath
by them been possessed: for the kingdome of Dacia hee subdued,
Armenia, Parthia, and Mesopotamia made subiect, Assyria,
Persia and Babylon conquered, passed Tygris, and stretched
the confines of the Romane Empire vnto the remotest dominions
of the Indies, which neuer before that time had seene the
Romane Banners, or so much as heard of their name; besides
his morall vertues were such, that in the choyce of a new Emperour,
they euer wished for one more happie then Augustus,
better then Traian: and yet this man with whom for outward
prosperitie no Christian Emperour can bee balanced, was
not only out of the Church, but an enemie to it, &amp; raised against
it the third, and one of the hotest persecutions of the tenne.
For further proofe hereof, I referre the reader for this point to
S. Augustines first 10. bookes of the Citie of God, and surely he

discouer the lightnesse of this reason, and the vanitie of the
assertion. I speake not to detract from the Christian and truely
Catholike religion, euen in regard of outward blessings, but
onely to proue that God bestowes them sometimes vpon the
good, thereby to shew that absolutely and in themselues they
are not bad: sometimes againe vpon the bad, to shew that in
themselues they are not good, and takes them sometimes from
both, to shew that in their owne nature they are indifferent.

this point with a long enumeration of particulars: but I thinke it

                  Why you should ioyne Queene Elizabeth with the great
Turke, I see no reason, but onely for the iustifying of Rainolds
his booke of Caluino Turcisme. Otherwise a marueile it is that
you would instance in her happinesse, whom the Pope in his
Briefe declared amiserable woman, and yet her gouernement
was not more happie, then her sisters (who notwithstanding
shee submitted her necke to the Romane yoke) was vnfortunate,
howbeit in her owne disposition, she is reported to haue
been a gracious and vertuous Lady, instance may bee brought
in the bringing in of a forreiner, the frustrating of the great
hope of her conception, her short and bloody reigne, extraordinary
dearths, and hurts by thunder, and fire, and lastly the
losse of Calis, the last footing wee had in France, being held by
her predecessors the space of about 250 yeeres: whereas
Queene Elizabeth oppugned and accursed from her very
Cradle by the Church of Rome, their thunderbolts returned
vpon their owne heads, and her selfe like a tender plant after a
thunder shower prospered the more, and being no lesse full
of honour then dayes, she was gathered to her fathers as a ripe
sheafe of corne that is carried into the barne, in so much that

of her singular vertues and excellencies, erected to

future ages would thinke it fabulous, but specially
to shew that hee ascribeth all her honour and prosperitie, not
to the Church of Rome, as Mr. Doctor doth, or to the religion by
him called Catholike, but to her deuotion and pietie, and the
restoring of religion to its primitiue syncerity: For with it as
shee made the entrance of her reigne, so doth hee of her Epitaph,
both esteeming it as the head spring from whence all that
ensuing happinesse did flow and was deriued; neither can it in
mine vnderstanding bee otherwise ascribed to Rome, then in
granting that the reputation and renowne which shee wanne
was in part gained and much increased by escaping (through
Gods especiall prouidence euer watchfull ouer her) the manifold
treasons, and frustrating the barbarous attempts that
were hatched at Rome, and to bee acted by Romish vassals, aswell
against her person as estate: which made her greatest enemies
confesse [the finger of God is heere] and surely had not

clearely of opinion the beames of her honour had not shined so
clearely and gloriously to the world, as they did. Lastly,
those singularities which you bring of being a woman, a maiden
Queene, and the last of her Race, they were indeed aduantages
of admiration: but such in my iudgement, as rather shew that

shee was blessed from heauen, then by any earthly meanes, in
as much as liuing and dying both without the helpe of an husband,
and hope of an heire from her owne body, she notwithstanding
proiected and effected so great matters, and so much
good to the State she gouerned.

These and
such like are principles of great importance to increase an Empire,
and to maintaine a temporall State: But there is no State in Christendome
that may endure these Principles, vnlesse they meane to
turne Turkes also, which although some be willing to doe, yet they
will neither hold in Capite, nor hold their peace in Religion, nor
suffer their King to haue such a guard about him, nor admit of Catholike
Religion so much as the Turke doeth

                  You might with the Turke aswell haue ioyned the King of
China, the Sophie of Persia, the Chame of Tartarie; the great
Magore, Presbiter Iohn &amp; the like, whose estates few Christian
Princes exceede, or can match in riches and greatnes: But that
they should haue their estates Conferred on them by the Prince
that ruleth in the aire, neither Ambrose affirmes it, nor is it in
it selfe true▪ Saint Ambrose his words are these, A Deo, potestatum
ordinatio, amalo, ambitio potestatis: The ordaining of the power
is from God, but the ambitious desire, not the conferring of it, from
the diuell. Indeed it is his challenge in that chapter, [To whomsoeuer
I will, I giue it,] speaking of the power and glory of earthly
Kingdomes; but it is the voice of God speaking in the person
of wisedome,Rom. 13. in the 8th. 
                     of the Prouerbs, [By mee Kings
raigne,] and Saint Paul teacheth vs, [There is no power, such as
himselfe liued vnder, but of God,] to which purpose it is well
sayd of S. Augustine (whom M. Doctor pretendeth to follow
most among the ancients) [Qui dedit Mario,

the father or his sonne most sweet Emperours, gaue it
also to Domitian the most cruell: and that I should not need to
reckon vp the rest in particular, He that gaue it to Constantine
the Christian, gaue it to Iulian the apostata.] So then in Saint
Augustines opinon God did not onely order those honours
by his prouidence, as you would haue it, but conferre them
by his bounty. Neither haue we any reason to thinke, but that
he who called Cyrus his Shepheard and his Anointed, and gaue
him the treasures of darkenesse, and assured Nabuchadonosor by
his Prophe
                        •
                     , that himselfe had giuen to him a Kingdome, and
power, and strength, and glorie, may as truely bee sayd to haue

conferred that gouernment vpon the Turke which now he holds.
But it seemes you aime through the Turkes sides to strike at
Queene Elizabeth, and through her at King Iames, Infidels
and Heretikes being in the Roman language ranked together:
So that their king domes being not by Gods donation, they might
lie loose, and by occasion fall as it were by excheate to his holinesse
gift. Your reasons of the largenesse and long continuance
of the Turkish Empire are as farre from the purpose, as your
whole discourse is from any sound Diuinitie: for not to stand
vpon the sifting of the trueth of them, which in some of them
may not vniustly be questioned, your inference is that such
principles are of great importance to increase and maintaine a temporall
estate: But the point is, whether any can be of sufficient
importance to vphold any estate, when God for the dishonouring
of his CHRIST is purposed to ruine it, and as the Psalmist
speakes [of a fruitfull land to make it barren for the iniquity of
the people that dwell therein] before you speake of a Supernaturall
iudgement of God in destruction, and here of a Naturall and
humane inuention for preseruation, which can hold no more
proportion with the former, then a Venice glasse with an yron
pot, or an earthen vessell with a brasen. Lastly, what states you
should meane that are willing to become Turkish, I know not;
but what they are that inioy their estates in capite Ecclesiae ad
voluntatem Domini Papae, and enioyne the greatest silence, and
outward reuerence in matters of Religion, and withall are
content to admit the toleration of Iewes and Turkes too, in
their Dominions, rather then of Christians, your selfe when
you wrote this could not bee ignorant. Nay, some of the
Popes themselues, as namely Alexander the VI. and Paulus
the III. if we may credite Thuanus, had secret commerce with
the great Turke against the Christian Princes, and the former
of them, if Iouius, and Guicciardin mistake not, tooke vnder
hand of the Turke Baiazets two hundred thousand Crownes,
to kill his brother Gemen. And Alexander the III. wrote to the
Soldan, that if he would liue quietly, he should by some sleight
murther the Emperour Frederike Barbarossa, and to that ende
sent him the Emperours picture.

in stead of Iuno, and Iacob bleare-eyed Lea in stead of Rachel,
but in trueth of the Church of Rome wee may safely say, that
with Esops dog in snatching at the shadow, she hath lost the substance
of religion, she hath so couered ouer all the parts of diuine
seruice with the leaues of ceremonies, that hardly is the
fruit it selfe to be seene, she hath so bepainted the face of Gods
worship, that not easily is the natiue complexion thereof to
be

                     ound. The Poet spake it of the women of his time, Pars
minima est ipsa puellasui. But we may more truely affirme it of
the Romish religion, her ornaments and apparell are such, that
a man may seeke Rome in Rome, and her religion in her religion,
and not find either. I will giue but one instance for all. Bellarmine
                     
in the conclusion of his controuersies of the Sacrament of
Baptisme, maketh no lesse then twelue ceremonies to march
before it, fiue to assist, and fiue to hold vp the traine, of which
some are profane, the greatest part ridiculous, and few or none
(wherein wee differ) so much as knowen to the primitiue
Church. Now if the Church of England haue scowred off the
drosse, and pared away the superstition, and nouelty, retaining
the substance, together with the most comely and ancient ceremonies,
aswell in this Sacrament, as in other parts of diuine
seruice, and his Maiesty follow her therein, shall he therefore
be sayd to imbrace the shadow and not the body? whereas in truth
if euer King of England embraced the body of religion without
respect to the shadow of vaine and needlesse ceremonies, it is
his Maiesty, which while he doth, there is little feare (by Gods
grace) of his dying out of the body of Christs true Catholike
Church, whose head is, not the Bishop of Rome, but Christ
himselfe, vnderstood in the 10. of S. Iohns Gospel [and there shal
be one sheepefold and one sheepeheard.]

                  For his reall body is not (as the vbiquitaries would haue it) euery
where, aswel without the Church as within, but only where himselfe
would haue it, and hath ordained that it should bee, and that is amongst
his Apostles, and Disciples, and their successours in the Catholique
Church, to whom he deliuered his Sacraments, and promised
to continue with them vntill the worlds end: So that though
Christ bee present in that Schisme, by the power of his dietie (for so
he is present inObserue the moderation of this reconciler, who would beare the world in hand that Christ is none otherwise present among vs in our Churches, then he is among the deuils in hell. hell also) yet by the grace of his humanity (by participation
of which grace, onely there is hope of saluation) hee is not
present there at all, except it beIf they shall say vnto you, Behold he is in the secret chambers, beleeue it not. Mat. 24. 26. in corners, and prisons, and places

vtter enemies.

                  By the reall body of Christ, I suppose you vnderstand the naturall,
his mysticall body being also reall, but not naturall: and
I see not but this naturall body may as well bee euery where
(wherein you taxe the Vbiquitaries) as in heauen and on earth,
and vpon earth in tenne thousand places at the same instant,
which the Church of Rome maintaines: but it seemes by confining
of him to the Church on earth, your purpose is to exclude
him from heauen; and surely mine opinion is (God forgiue
me if I thinke amisse) that a great part of those who professe
his naturall body to be here, doubt much of his being there.
And for the grace of his humanitie (as you call it) thus much no
Christian man will denie, that when Christ sanctified his owne
flesh, giuing as God, and taking as man the holy Ghost, he did
not this for himselfe onely, but for our sakes, that the grace of
sanctification and life which was first receiued in him, might
passe from him to his whole race; as malediction came from
Adam vnto all mankinde. That which quickeneth vs is the
spirit of the second Adam, and his flesh that wherewith hee
quickneth; our corruptible bodies could neuer liue the life
they shall liue, were it not that here they are ioyned with his
body which is incorruptible, and that his is in ours as a cause
of immortality, and as little doubt there is but that this vitall
and sauing grace which flowes from the humanitie of Christ, is
imparted vnto vs by meanes of the Sacraments, they being sensible
instruments for the conueying of those blessings to our
soules, which are in themselues incomprehensible. And for
that Sacrament which is most properly said to impart life vnto
the receauer (as the other doth food and sustenance) it is acknowledged
by those very men, who are otherwise most bitter
and vncharitable towards vs, that children baptized with vs,
are thereby made capable of eternall saluation, as far forth as if
they had receiued that Sacrament in that Church, &amp; after that
forme which they cal Catholike, &amp; cōsequently you are inforced

(out of the strēgth of your own principles) to grant (howbeit
out of malice you labour to denie it,) that the grace of
Christs humanity is not onely present with vs in corners and prisons
among your complices, but in our publique congregations in a
more speciall manner, then by the power of his dietie, by
which he is as wel present among the diuels in hell, as among the
Pope &amp; Cardinals, assembled in consistory for the subuersion of
states and ruine of kingdoms: yet to affirme, that he is none otherwise
present in that Church (except in corners and prisons and
places of persecution) but onely by the power of his dietie, and not at
all by the grace of his humanity, I will neither be so vnaduised as
to deliuer, nor so vncharitable as to conceiue; howbeit I haue
good reason both to conceiue and to deliuer thus much, that
the honour which you pretend you doe him in your will-worship,
cannot but redound to his great dishonour, nay our assurance
is, that being successours of his Apostles and Disciples
in doctrine, as you are of the Pharises in traditions, the promise
of his presence to the worlds end, as well by the sanctification, as
the direction of his holy Spirit, is rather made to vs then you.

                  Wee as willingly grant, as you are ready to prooue,
that a great dishonour is done to Christ, by maintaining Schisme
and dissention in his Church, which ought to bee without
seame, as his coat. But we demand, who were the authours of
this Schisme? they which departed not frō the Church it selfe,
but from the corruptions thereof, or they who stiffely maintaining
those corruptions, inforced this departure? when Iacob
was driuen to depart from Laban by his ill vsage, was the
breach in Iacob, or in Laban? when God commaundeth his
people to goe out of Babylon lest they should partake of her
sinnes and plagues, doeth the going out of the people make a
Schisme, or the sinnes of Babylon? It is true that wee haue forsaken
that society which wee held with Rome, but no farther

members of Christ, and as in many other things, so chiefly
in challenging that vniuersality of power and infallibility of
iudgement to her selfe, which is onely due to our Sauiour.
And shall we thinke that he will not in time reuenge this wrong?
It cannot be but that [her sinnes are come vp to heauen, and God
hath remembred her iniquities, and in due time that command
will take place, Reward her as she hath rewarded you, and giue
her double according to her workes, and in the cup that shee hath

and shall see no mourning▪ Therefore shall her plagues come at

                  You are herein somewhat more manerly in words, though
litle lesse malicious in heart then Dr. Bishop, a bird of the same
feather, who in an Epistle directed in like manner to his MAIESTIE
as yours is, spares not to speake out, but tels him
plainely [when they see no hope of remedie, the state being now setled,
and a continuall posteritie like to ensue of one nature and condition,

God knoweth what that forcible weapon of necessitie may constraine

neither his bloodie threates, nor your sugred promises, can
moue it one point from the center of that trueth which himselfe
hath still professed, and in which his posterity are trained
vp. And thus the weakenesse of the foundation, vpon
which the first reason of your vaine hope is grounded, is discouered.
God in his promises is alwayes most sure, but this your
reason pretended to be grounded thereupon most vnsure, since
neither the true Religion is found at this day in that Church
which you call Catholike▪
                      neither are temporall blessings alwayes
annexed to that Religion which is indeed true. Thus
much you might haue learned of Hall the Iesuite, who after the
discouery of the Powderplot, recites vnto Littleton for his comfort
certaine examples of Heretikes ouercomming Catholikes
in battell, and Infidels ouerthrowing Christians, or of

(saith hee) are worldlings arguments, no necessary improuements
of Gods blessing,] howbeit Father Robert Bellarmine makes it
one of the 15. and Bozius one of his 100. notes of the true
Church: but much rather and better might you haue learned
it of the Prophet Dauid, who was so sorely perplexed with
this point, that till he went into the Sanctuarie of God, and
there vpon consultation with him vnderstood the reason of it,
hee was well nigh at his wits end, saying to himselfe in a kinde
of despaire, [Psal. 73. 
                     Then haue I clensed mine heart in vaine, in vaine
haue I washed mine hands in innocencie.] Yet if the argument
were infallible, God hath approued the trueth of his Maiesties
Religion by those manifold outward blessings and miraculous
deliuerances, which of his merc
                        •

him: So that his Maiestie might iustly take vp that of the same
Prophet in another place, [Psal. 103. 
                     Blesse the Lord, O my soule, and forget
not all his benefits: who redeemeth thy life from destruction, who
crowneth thee with louing kindnesse, and tender mercies] and our

hope and vnfained prayer to God is, that whiles his Maiestie
ceaseth not in this maner to honour God, God will not cease in like
maner to honour him and his posteritie, with many blessings in
this world, and in the next with eternall happinesse.

                  TheIn the front of this reason, you seeme to disstinguish it from the former, but in the pursuit of this Section you meerely confound them. second reason of my hope that Catholike Religion may be a
great meanes of honor &amp; security to your Maiesties posteritie, is taken
from the consideration of your neighbors, the Kings and Princes
of Christendome; among whom there isIn saying so, you cannot but put his Maiestie to rebuke also, there being the like, &amp; none other reason of him and of other Kings, who haue disclaimed vnion with Rome.
                      no state ancient and truely
honourable, but onely those that are Catholike: The reason
whereof I take to be, because theI meruaile much where those rules were to be found, for the space of the first 300. yeeres after Christ, and whether ye greatnesse and Maiesty of the great Turke, or King of China be not beyond all the rules that Catholike Religion deliuereth in that kind. rules of Catholike Religion are
Eternall, Vniuersall, and Constant vnto themselues, and with all so
consonant to Maiestie, and Greatnesse, as they haue made and preserued
the Catholike Church reuerent and venerable throughout
the Christian world for these thousand and sixe hundred yeres, and
those temporall states that haue beene conformable thereunto haue
beene alwayes most honourable, and so are like to continue vntill they
hearken vnto Schisme. And as for those that haue reiected and opposed
the rules of Catholike Religion, they haue beene driuen in
short time to degenerate, and become either tyrannicall or popular.
Your Maiestie I know doth abhorre tyrannie, but if Schisme and
Heresie might haue their full swinge ouer the Seas, the very shadow
and reliques of Maiestie in England should be vtterly defaced, and
quickly turned into Heluetian or Belgian popularity: for they that
make no conscience to prophane the Maiesty of God, and his Saints
in the Church, will, when they feele their strength make no bones to
What they are that despise gouernement, and speake euill of those that bee in authoritie, his Maiestie is not now to seeke. violate the Maiestie of the King, and his children in the common

                  Hauing opened your entrance to a second reason in shew, but
indeed the same with the former, you tell vs that among all the
Kings and Princes of Christendome, there is no state ancient and
truely honorable, but onely those that are Catholike; wherein
you doe the King of Denmarke and Sweden, specially the former,
great honour, in consideration belike of his neere alliance
to his Maiestie, as also to all the secular Princes of Germanie,
(the house of Austria and the Duke of Bauaria onely excepted)
and among the rest the Prince Elector Palatine of Rhine,
his Maiesties sonne in law is most bound to thanke you, and it
seemes you conceiued so much by intending your iourney to
Hydelberg: and good reason you should haue been welcome,
considering you make both him and all the rest of the Kings
and Princes of Christendome that haue forsaken Communion
with the Church of Rome, to bee both base and tyrannicall:
wheras I may be bold to say it, that at this day there are
none more moderate in their gouernments, then those whom
you call Schismatikes, and of them the greatest part were neuer
so flourishing, as since they renounced societie with that
Church, specially the Heluetians and Belgians, in whom you
instance, being growen more rich, more powerfull and
politike in their affaires, then euer before: And for popularity
the Heluetians had it long before any change of religion, and
those very Cantons which call themselues Catholike, retaine
that forme and none other vnto this day: And for the Belgians
it appeares by the Prince of Orenge his Apollogie, that they euer
challenged their freedome as due by the Capitulations betweene
them and their gouernours the Dukes of Burgundy,
and now at last after so much Christian blood spilt (as all the
world knowes) in the Articles of peace concluded betweene
the King of Spaine and them, they are declared a free State.
Now whether they make any conscience of profaning the Maiestie
of God, let their published Confessions which testifie, and

hee that compares their practise with that of the Italians, may
easily iudge of the tree by the fruits, whether wee regard the
prophanation of his Maiesty in the blaspheming of his Name, or
the disgracing of his word, or the vnsanctifying of his day; &amp;
for his Saints they all agree (I speake for the maine body of
their guides and professours) in giuing them as much honour
as they are lawfully capable of, or would themselues willingly
receiue; and if this bee the heresie you meane, wee professe it

that ther
                        •
                     by the Maiestie of our King is any way violated,
but rather strengthened and increased. Lastly, whereas you
tell vs that you take the reason of all this to bee, because the rules of
Catholike religion are eternall, vniuersall and constant to themselues;
I graunt there is and ought to be a mutuall dependance
betwixt religion and ciuill policie, the one both giuing and receiuing
life and strength vnto, and from the other: yet true religion
medleth not so much with the temporal state, as to hinder
or further the proceedings of it, otherwise then by the
force of the word and the power of Ecclesiasticall censures:
but that which you call the Catholike religion, hath (like the
Iuie that growes into the wall) so incorporated and intwisted
it selfe into the bowels of those States where it is setled, that it
can hardly bee rooted out, or remooued without endangering
the bodies of the States themselues, which cannot but giue vs
iust occasion to suspect, that it is for the most part in the points
controuersed betweene vs, nothing else but a policie inuented
of men, to serue their owne turnes. And consequently according
to your owne rule set downe in the second Section of your
first chapter, a false and counterfeit religion. And in trueth when
wee shall come to examine the rules of that Church, wee shall
finde that they are not so consonant to the Maiestie and greatnesse
of temporall Princes, as you pretend, but rather tend to
the trampling of their Maiestie vnder foote, and laying their
honour in the dust, and to the aduancing and raising of the
greatnesse of the Bishop of Rome to the vtmost pitch and possibilitie
of height. Some of these rules which make so much
for the Maiestie of Kings are brought by Bellarmine, and by his

Maiestie truely obserued and quoted in the latter end of his
Apologie for the Oath for Allegeance, which because they are so
pat to this present purpose, I will craue pardon to borrow and
annexe hereunto: they are twelue in all, a fit number for the Iesuites

haue I here set in opposition each to other, [vt ex contrarijs iuxta se
positis veritas magis elucescere possit:] and thus farre I dare boldly
affirme, that whosoeuer will indifferently weigh these irreconciliable
contradictions here set downe, will easily confesse
that Christ is no more contrary to Beliall, light to darkenesse,
and heauen to hell, then Bellarmines estimation of Kings is to
Gods, by whom they are called (as his Maiestie noteth before)

and greatnesse of Kings; but the rules of that religion which
you call Catholike, as they are reported by Bellarmine, (next
his Holinesse, the chiefe pillar and Proctor thereof this age
hath aforded) most disconsonant and repugnant thereunto. I
cannot but wonder then what Mr. Doctor meant to write
thus to his Maiestie, who hauing so particularly and exquisitely
published his mind to the world in this point, it must needs

argue grosse ignorance and negligence in him, not to haue
read or obserued what was by him written, or a strong presumption
of his owne abilitie with one breath of his mouth, or

                     Geuses of Germanie (a nicke name first
imposed on the Netherlanders by Barlamont a Spanish factor)
(who withstood the bringing in of the Spanish Inquisition among
them, and vpon occasion of that name, tooke for their
deuice a wallet and a dish, with this Inscription; Faithfull to
God and the King euen to beare the Wallet: Inferring thereby,
that they were better Subiects then Barlamont and his adherents)
are more able vpon all occasions to second his Maiestie,
specially vpon the Seas, then any other State in Christendome.
What seruice they did vs in the yeere 1588. by keeping the
Prince of Parma from ioyning with the Spanish fleete, which
had swallowed vs vp in conceit, it is well knowen, and no
doubt but being confederates and friendly vsed, they would
be readie vpon like occasion to performe the like friendly office.
And for those whom you call Catholikes, I would know
how many of them labor to aduance their confederates farther
then it stands with their owne aduantage or reputation.
                  In matter of Religion the Netherlander, Heluetian, and
French differ not at all: and from some States of the higher
Germanie, they differ not so much as the French Catholike,
from the Romish and Spanish, in as much as the latter admit
of the Councell of Trent, the former not so: and againe, (which
is another notable and maine point of difference) the former
submit the Pope to a generall Councell, the latter not, but as
they haue made him transcendent ouer Kings; so haue they
ouer Bishops too, not onely single, but assembled in Synode.
So that vpon the matter they were as good keepe themselues
at home, and saue so much trauell and charge: But to graunt
those (whom notwithstanding you call Caluinists without exception
or distinction) were not agreed of their owne religion,
yet to say that the rules of particular and transitorie honour

depend vpon the principles of vniuersall and eternall truth, it can by
no meanes be admitted as a true principle, since those rules by
reason may be, and by practise are as certaine and constant amongst
Infidels as Christians. No people were euer more punctuall
and precise in termes of honour then the ancient Grecians
and Romanes, yet were they we know without God in the
world, without the knowledge of vniuersall and eternall truth.
And the same may be iustified of many of the Easterne princes
at this day: but I cannot but meruaile at your folly (specially
taking vpon you to play the Statesman) in telling his Maiestie
that the Caluinists will neuer agree together in making any one
king ouer them all, as if any Prince in Christendome were so
sencelesse as to expect it, or they so mad as to offer it, considering
they are all either vnder the obedience of other Soueraignes,
or free Estates of thēselues: And yet no doubt but as
great securitie may be expected from them, as from your Catholikes,
though his Maiestie were vnited to them in Religion, in
as much as they maintaine not the lawfulnesse of aequiuocation,
nor acknowledge any superiour power able to assoile
them from the obligation of their oathes, and solemne promises.
What reason hath his Maiestie (if hee were as firmely ioyned
to them in the vnitie of their Religion, as the Pope himselfe
could desire) to expect greater securitie from them then his
Predecessors found at the hands of their Ancestors, or themselues
vpon occasion and opportunitie finde at the hands each
of other? Nay if they find no securitie many times from the
Popes themselues, who are the pretended heads of that Religion,
with what assurance can they expect it one from another,
being thereby onely linked together as members vnto that
head? It hath beene sayd of some of them, how iustly I leaue
to those who haue made triall, that they neither sing as they
pricke, nor pronounce as they write▪ nor speake as they thinke:
the latter of which (if we may credit Comines) might iustly be
verified of Lewis the XI. of France, who made shew of deuotion
in the vnity of that religion, no man more, in so much that he
would often sweare by, and kisse his Nostredam of lead which
he euer wore as a brouch in his hat, yet what little security other

princes of the same religion found at his hands in their
contracts with him, the same historiographer who was well
acquainted with his secrets, witnesseth, and were he silent, yet
his counsell giuen to his sonne Charles the eight, that hee
should learne no more latine but this, Qui nescit dissimulare,
nescit regnare, would speake as much; which lesson is indeede
onely recorded of him, but it may rather bee wished, then
thought that it is not learned and practised of the greatest part
of the great ones in the world; Machiauels name being hatefull
and odious to all, but his rules and preceps too much imbraced
of some.

                  The third reason of my hope that Catholike religion should bee
most auaileable for the honour and security of your Maiesty and
your children, is taken from the consideration of your subiects, which
can be kept in obedience to God and to their king by no other religion,
and least of all by the

men should sinne, as that Christ should die for sinne; which kinde of

ordinary among your countrey. Caluinists, thatThey might quickly bee as learned as your selfe in the Scriptures, for any thing appeares in this Epistle. take themselues to

and haue found a weaker brother whom they thinke fit to instruct
in these profound mysteries: and howsoeuer they be not yet all
so impudent as to holde these conclusions in plaine termes, yet it is
certaine they all hold these principles of doctrine from whence
working heads of greater liberty, doe at their pleasures draw these
consequences in their liues and practises: and is this a religion fit to
keepe subiects in obedience to their Soueraigne?
               
               
                  
                  G. H.
                  12.
                  Your third reason to perswade his Maiesty to the renouncing
of his owne religion, and the imbracing of yours is, by
bearing him in hand that none other will keepe his subiects in obedience,
and least of all the Caluinisticall. But is it possible so learned
and so wise a man as you take your selfe to bee, should
write in this maner, and withall remember that your letter was
directed to his Maiesty, who hath long since1 In his speech in Parliament after the Powder treason. proclaimed it to
the world that [no other sect of heretikes, not excepting Turke,
Iew, nor Pagan, no not euen those of Calicute, who adore the deuill,
did euer maintaine it by the grounds of their religion, Marke (by
the grounds of their religion) that it was lawfull or rather meritorious
(as the Romish Catholikes call it) to murder princes, or people
for quarrell of religion: And although particular men of all professions
of religion, haue beene some theeues, some murtherers,
some traitours, yet euer when they came to their ende and iust punishment,
they confessed their fault to be in their nature, and not in
their profession, these Romish Catholikes onely excepted.] And if
that be your religion which we finde maintained by the chiefe
pillars and Doctours of your Church, and determined to bee
Catholike by your Popes and Cardinals, surely we haue as litle
reason to entertaine your doctrine, as wee haue good reason euer
to be iealous of your practise. Your doctrine is, That the
Pope, if hee thinke good, may excommunicate and depose
kings, and dispose of their kingdomes, by absoluing their subiects
from their allegeance, and setting forraine princes to inuade
there dominions, as if they held not their Crownes from
God, but from him, and as if they were to write no more in
their stiles, by the grace of God, but by the Popes grace, king of
such or such a kingdom. Your doctrine is, that treason deliuered
vnder the seale of cōfession is not to be discouered, though
it be to the indangering of your Soueraigns person, &amp; the subuersion
of the whole body of the State. Your doctrine is, That
as many Churchmen as are in the Kingdom (which in most is

a third part, in some more) they are all exempted from the coertion
of the ciuill Magistrate, being for punishment, whether
in bodie or in estate, onely lyable to the censures of Ecclesiasticall
courts, which haue both dependance vpon the Popes authoritie,
and direction from his Canon Law. Your doctrine
is, That as many Bishops and Arch-Bishops as are any where
consecrated, ought to take their oath to bee true and loyall to
their good Lord and holy Father of Rome, to the vtmost to
execute and further his Commaunds, without any limitation
or reference to the authoritie of their Soueraigne Lord the
King, as may appeare by the tenour of the oath here ensuing,
which I haue annexed, to the end the Reader may iudge whether
this be the onely Religion (as Mr. Doctour pretendeth) to
keepe Subiects in obedience to their Kings.
                  
                  [I Iohn Bishop or Abbot of A. from this
houre forward, shall be faithfull and obedient
to S. Peter, and to the Holy Church of
Rome, and to my Lord the Pope and his Successors
Canonically entring. I shall not bee
of counsaile, nor consent that they shall
lose either life or member, or shall bee taken
or suffer any violence or any wrong by any
meanes. Their counsaile to mee credited by
them, their messengers or Letters, I shall not
willingly discouer to any person. The Popedome
of Rome, the rules of the holy Fathers,
and the regalities of S. Peter, I shall helpe, retaine
&amp; defend against all men. The Legate
of the Sea Apostolike going and comming,
I shall honourably intreate. The rights honours,

priuiledges, authorities of the Church
of Rome, and of the Pope and his Successors,
I shall cause to bee conserued, defended,
augmented and promoted. I shall not bee
in Counsell, Treatie, or any act in the which
any thing shall be imagined against him or
the Church of Rome, their rights, states, honours
or power: And if I know any such to
bee mooued or compassed, I shall resist to
my power, and assoone as I can, I shall aduertise
him, or such as may giue him knowledge.
The rules of the Holy Fathers, the
decrees, ordinances, sentences, dispositions,
reseruations, prouisions, and commandements
Apostolike, I shall keepe to
my power &amp; cause to be kept of other. Heretikes,
Schismatikes and Rebels to our Holy
Father and his Successours, I shall resist
and persecute to my power. I shall come to
the Synode when I am called, except I bee
let by a Canonical impediment. The lights
of the Apostle I shall visite personally, or
by my deputie: I shall not aliene or sell
my possessions without the Popes Councell,
so God mee helpe and the holy Euangelists.]
                  
                     No meruaile then that Henry the eight when he commaunded
the forme of this Oath to bee publikely reade in Parliament,
complained to the Speaker Sir Tho. Audely and some
others, whom for that purpose he sent for, that he had thought
the Clergie of his Realme had bene his Subiects wholly, [but
now we haue well perceiued (sayeth hee) that they are to vs but
halfe Subiects, or indeed scarce Subiects at all.] Finally, your doctrine
is, that the Christians in the Primatiue Church abstained
from taking armes, not so much for conscience sake, as
because they wanted strength: which must needs open a wide
gappe to the people, vpon any humorous discontent, when
they once feele their owne strength, like an vntamed horse to
cast their rider if they may; and that I may speake in your own
phrase, to make no bones of violating the Maiestie of the king
and his children, and is this a Religion fit to keepe Subiects in obedience
to their Soueraignes?
                  
                  Whereas our doctrine on the other side is, That the persons
of princes are sacred, and by Gods ordinance priuiledged
from all violence: and for their actions, that they are onely accomptable
to God, their Crownes and Scepters not disposeable
by any; but by him who set the one vpon their heads, and
the other in their hands, who hath the name written on his
thigh, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, (who as Iob speaketh)
[Iob. 12. 19. 21. 
                     leadeth Princes away spoiled, and ouerthroweth the mightie,
and againe he powreth contempt vpon Princes, and weakeneth
the strength of the mightie.] Lastly, our doctrine is, that the
Subiects duetie is not by any dispensable, but by him alone,
who by his diuine prouidence subiected them to that power.
Now whether of these doctrines, ours or yours is most likely
to keepe men in obedience, euen our enemies shall bee our
Iudges: Yet this to bee your doctrine your bookes witnesse,
and no man of learning and ingenuitie among you will denie.
                  But for our doctrine you pretend the opinions of Caluinists,
and those countrey Caluinists, and those met in an Alehouse,
not in plaine termes, but by consequences gathered, not by
sober or setled braines vpon iudgement, but by working heads
of greater libertie at their pleasure, and that not in their bookes

or speeches, but in their liues and practises. Thus the mountains
swell as if wee should haue a giant borne; but at length after
much expectation wee haue a little mouse brought into the
world. What Mr. Doctour, are there no principles in the Romish
Catholike Religion, from whence working heads, of greater
libertie, doe at their pleasures draw the like dangerous consequences
in their liues and practises? If there bee none, how
comes it to passe that there are so many of that profession by
whose deedes a man may safely guesse, they say in their hearts
there is no God? If there be any, why doe you so pathetically
exclaime against Caluinists, as if they stood single in this bill of
inditement? Shall we accuse our Blessed SAVIOVR, because
he is to some a rocke of offence, or his precious Word, because
to some it prooues a sauour of death vnto death? and if wee
must acquit him, and lay the fault where it is, on them who
draw poison to hurt themselues out of the sweetest flowers,
and dazell their owne eyes by looking on the comfortable
beames of the Sunne, surely you haue no reason in my iudgement
in this case (as by your selfe it is opened) to accuse our
doctrine.

the cleane contrary, namely, that God doth not incline
to euill naturally but morally: and in the same place hee is bold
to say, that God not onely permitteth wicked men to doe many euils,
but that by a figure he commandeth it, and exciteth men vnto
it, as a huntsman setteth the dogge vpon the Hare, by letting goe
the slip that held the dogge: Nay, hee further addeth, hee fits as
president ouer the willes of wicked men: hee ruleth and gouerneth
them,
                     Torquet ac flectit in eis inuisibiliter operando. 
                     he boweth and bendeth them by working inuisibly in them,
and that positiuely, as hee acknowledgeth within a few lines,
though before hee denie it: These very wordes of Bellarmine
doth Kellison reprehend in Caluin, in the 1. Chap. of his booke
of his Suruay, the same man maketh Caluin to teach that God
is the onely sinner, in as much as hee doubteth not to say, that
the will of God is the necessitie of things, whereas indeede
they are S. Augustines words, de Gen. ad lit. lib. 6. cap. 15. and so
rightly quoted by Caluin, though Kellison professe S. Augustine
haue no such thing in the place by him alleaged. So that
if they had the charitie to interpret the speaches of our men
as gently and fauourably as they doe their owne, there would
appeare little difference, or none at all, and I will vndertake to
shewe, if I bee put to it, that many speaches and passages goe
for currant and Catholike doctrine among them, which if they
should bee alleaged out of Caluin, would be censured as heresie:
but it seemeth the ground of the song which Mr. Doctor
here descanteth on, was taken out of Kellison in the forenamed
booke and chapter, where hee alleageth Caluins words to be
these, but falsly quoted out of his 37. Booke: [I grant that
theeues and murtherers, and other euill doers are the instruments
of Gods prouidence, whom the Lord doth vse to execute
those iudgements which hee hath himselfe determined,]
as if Caluin said any more, or so much herein then S. Peter
hath giuen him warrant for, in the 4 chap. of the Acts, where he
thus speaketh, [Vers. 27. 28.

and directed by the hand of God, for the execution of his
iudgements: wherefore let Kellison either accuse these holy
penmen of God, and teach them to correct their manner of
speaking, or let him cease to accuse Caluin for this passage,
who there in affirmeth no more, nor so much as they doe.
                  To conclude, what wee maintaine in this poynt touching
the will or cooperation of God in sinne or with sinners, is among
many others fully and cleerely deliuered by the pens of
the most Reuerend father in God the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury
his Grace, now being, in the last of his sixe solemne Lectures,
read in the Vniuersitie of Oxford, for his degree of Doctorship,
of Doctor Abbot now L. Bishop of Salisbury in his
answere to Doctor Bishops preface to his second part, of Doctor
Morton Deane of Winchester in the first Booke and 25.
Chap. of his Cath. Apologie, of Doctor Feild Deane of
Glocester in his third Booke and 23. Chapter of the Church, and
lastly of my late worthy Colleague Doctor White, in the 41.
Digression, and 50. Paragraph of The way to the Church. The
summe of all is this, that about and concerning sin God doth
three things; first as a cause vniuersall hee sustaineth and vpholdeth
the beeing and moouing, both of the nature and actions
whether good or bad of all mankind: Secondly, by withdrawing
his grace which should lighten the vnderstandings
and soften and mollifie the hearts of men: Thirdly by giuing
way to Satan, to worke vpon them, and no way either strengthening
them against him, or weakning his force: Fourthly, by
ordinating sinne, which is nothing else but the disposing and
directing of it in such maner and measure, as to him seemeth
best, that it stretcheth it selfe no further or otherwise, either
for time or place, or persons, then his good pleasure willeth:
sometimes he turneth it to another end then the person doing it
thought of, somtimes he maketh way for it by shutting vp and
stopping all other passages by which it might breake foorth,

sometimes hee punisheth one sinne with another, as pride is
punished with enuie, he being not the author of enuie, as it is
sinfull, but as is it carries a sting with it, implying a contrariety
betweene it and the soule of man, which maketh it bitter and
afflictiue. Fiftly and lastly, by occasioning sinne accidentally,
as when God doeth that which in it selfe is good, and yet
knoweth through the euill disposition which is in men, it will
giue occasion to increase their wickednesse, and make it greater
then it was before. This I take to be the substance and effect
of that wee hold touching this point, and I doubt not but
the vndertaking of my deceased fellow Chaplaine may bee
made good, in shewing euery parcell of this doctrine in the
writings of those, who either liue or died in profession, members
of the Church of Rome. To conclude then, God predestinateth
no man to bee a Traitour or a Theefe, but foreseeing
hee will bee so, hee determineth to make vse of their theft or
treason for the aduancement of his owne glory, and the aduantage
of his Church and children, hee being in himselfe so
good as hee would suffer none euill in the world, were hee not
withall so powerfull, as out of euery euill to draw some good,
as by the same power hee brought light out of darkenesse and
caused water abundantly to flowe out of the hard and drie
rocke.

                  The world is now come to a good passe, that those who obiect
the haynousnesse of horrible treasons, shall carrie the title of
the great masters of schisme: But notwithstanding we bee held
Schismatikes for our labour, we will not leaue to obiect it, and

not onely to obiect it, but crie and thunder against it, being as
his Maiesty hath rightly obserued [not onely a crying sinne of
blood, but a roaring and thundering sinne of fire and brimstone:]
and the rather for that we doe not therein so much obiect the
fact of those who were to be the actours in it, as the rules of
those their ghostly fathers and spirituall guides, who were acquainted
with it, and consenting to it,Garnet by Eudaemon. some of whom haue
since bene apologized by the pens of Romish writers, andGreenwell and Gerrard. other
some protected and countenanced in or by the court of
Rome it selfe. One reports it that the Pope caused the massacre
of Paris (what time in diuers places of France were murdered
about 60000 persons) to bee painted in his palace, it should
seeme ad perpetuam rei memoriam, lest so extreme wickednesse
should be forgotten. So no doubt should this Powder worke
haue bene painted by it, if it had not miscaried, saue that no art
could haue imitated the confusion, no colour haue represented
so barbarous cruelty. What staine could shadow the blood
of so royall Princes? what red were sufficient to paint the
blood of so many and noble Christians? what blacke the darknesse
of that day? what azure the vnmercifulnesse of that fire?
what deuise, what inuention could haue expressed the wofull
crie of the innocent, and the infernall noise of the blow? it
was the vttermost point of all villeny, beyond which is terra
incognita, no man can deuise what should bee betweene Hell
and it: and shall they then bee reputed masters of schisme who
obiect the foulenesse of a treason by your owne confession so horrible?
then let our greatest Bishops, our wisest Counsellours,
our grauest Iudges, and our Soueraigne himselfe, bee all accounted
the great Masters of schisme, who describe it by so
much more liuely then others, in as much as they looked
more narrowly into the particular veines and bowels of the
plot, were more capable to conceiue the vast extent of the
mischiefe likely to haue ensued vpon it, and lastly were more
sensible of the horrour of it, in regard of their owne danger.
Yet thus much we all conceiue, that if all the deuils and damned
spirits in hell, together with all the reprobates on earth,
should meet in Conclaue, and set all their inuentions aworke

to the vttermost, they could neuer finde out againe the like
hellish and damnable designe.
                  But had not the deuill (you say) wrought this to their handes,
we had litle to say against Catholikes before this day: As if the
Bull of Pius Quintus, the intiteling of the Spaniard to the
kingdome of Ireland, the rebellion of Northumberland and
Westmerland were now quite forgotten, or the practises of
Sommeruile set aworke by Hall a Seminary Priest of Spaine,
furnished at the Popes charge, with fiftie other resolutes, of
Throgmorton, sollicited by Bernardine Mendoza, the Spanish
Leiger Ambassadour lying in London, of Parry, incouraged by
Cardinall Comoes perswasion, of Ballard and Babington, together
with twelue other gentlemen imboldened by the same
Mendoza, of Stanly apologized by Cardinall Allen, of Cullen
an Irish fencer hired by Stanly for thirty pound, of Lopez a
phisitian and Portugall by birth, set a worke by Christophero
de Moro, a speciall counseller of the king of Spaine, for a iewel

against the State and person of our late renowned Soueraigne.
Had not her Maiesty iust cause then to complaine as
she did, in open Parliament, That shee knew no creature breathing,
whose life stood hourely in more perill then her owne, and
that euen in the first entrance into her estate, she entred into infinite

treasons, as well as of kingdomes, to perswade men that they
are moued thereunto by the good Spirit, that they are not only
satisfactory for sinne, but meritorious, holy, honourable, for
mine owne part I know not what is. But to proceede, who
were they, but pretended Catholikes, that were authors of the
Prince of Aurenge his vntimely death? of that bloody and
barbarous massacre in France, of whichIt was the speech of Christopherus Thua

historians writes,

And were not Philopater and Doleman, and Rossaeus Peregrinus
the bastards of Creswell and Parsons, and Reynolds long since
censured here at home, and lately the seditious bookes of Mariana,
Becanus, Suarez, all Romish Catholikes, and Iesuites,
condemned to the fire by the high Court of Parliament of Paris?
and yet notwithstanding all this and much more that
might be brought to this purpose out of his Maiesties Apologie,
would you now beare him and vs in hand, that had it not
bene for the Powder-treason, we had had little to say against Romish
Catholikes before this day? Certainely it must needes argue
(when you thus wrote) either your extreme ignorance in not
vnderstanding the passages of our estate, or extreme malice in
publishing the contrary to that which in my iudgement you
could not but vnderstand.
                  But you demand, one king to bee named in all the world that euer
receiued honor from Caluinists, farther then to be their champion
and protectour, vntill their turne were serued; as if you were
ignorant what honour Caluin himselfe yeelded to Francis the
first, in his Epistle prefixed to his institutions, howbeit he were
rather a persecutour, then a protectour of that profession, as
appeared by his commending the destruction of Mirandol and
Cabrieres to the Parliamēt of Prouence, howbeit afterward he
repented himselfe of the fact, and gaue charge to Henry his
sonne, to doe iustice vpon the murtherers: Henry the III. they
forsooke not to the last being persecuted, and at last murdered
by the leaguers: and as for Henry the IV. surnamed the great,

they not onely stucke close to him in all his distresses, when
his Romish Catholike subiects banded themselues against
him, but when hee had quitted his owne and their religion,
and of their champion became a great patron and benefactour
of the Iesuits, their most malitious opposites; yet did they not
cease to honour him still as much as any his most loyall and
louing subiects, both liuing, by their pennes and tongues,
and persons, and states, and beeing dead with their teares,
and desire of search to be made, and iustice to bee done vpon
such as should bee found to haue any finger in his death: Or
if you were ignorant of these forraine examples, yet could
you not but remember that here at home Edward the sixt,
and Queene Elizabeth of famous memory, and our present
gracious Soueraigne, receiued as much honour from those
whome you call Caluinists, as euer any prince in the world,
from his pretended Catholike subiects, and that not so much
for the seruing of their owne turnes, as for conscience sake, and
the performance of their dueties. What turne can they
now expect to be serued from Queene Elizabeth being gathered
to her fathers, yet doth her name remaine alwayes honourable
among them, and the memoriall of her pretious, as the
remembrance of Iosias, [Eccles. 49. 1. 
                     like the composition of the perfume that
is made by the art of the Apothecary, sweet as hony to all mouthes,
and as musicke at a banquet of wine.] wheras many of her Romish
Catholike subiects endeuoured what they could to haue taken
her heart blood from her beeing liuing, and still indeuour
what they can to take her good name from her beeing dead.
At his Maiesties entrance some of them pretended to honour
him, none more, but it was for the seruing of their owne
turnes, in hope of a toleration: for when once they sawe
the constancie of his MAIESTIES minde, and the vanity of
their owne hope, they hoped to haue serued him and his posterity
such a turne, as should haue sounded through the Christian
world, and haue made the eares of him to tingle, that should
haue heard it: whereas they who receiued not that satisfaction
at the conference of Hampton Court, which
they desired, and hoped for, continue notwithstanding faithfull

and loyall Subiects to their Soueraigne. Lastly for Queene
Mary though they could expect no good turne from her in regard
of their profession, but rather all the shrewd turnes that
her misguided zeale, and the malice of others could heape vpon
them, yet the Norfolke and Suffolke Protestants, were her
strongest furtherance to attaine the Crowne, and afterward
the rest as well as they, ceased not to honour her as farre foorth
as the honor due to God would giue them leaue, except some
few, who opposed themselues not so much against her Person
or Gouernment, as against the mariage with a forreiner, whose
power they feared would bee preiudiciall to the Realme, and
yet was not this attempt neither seconded or approued by the
maine bodie of that profession: [But all other Caluinists (you
say) doe ouerthrow their Kings and Princes wheresoeuer they can
preuaile,] in which passage can none other bee intended but
the Netherlanders, of whom touching this point, I will say no
more, that they are now after the wasting of so much treasure,
and the shedding of so much Christian blood, declared a free
estate by him, whose Regall right you pretend they ouerthrow.
                  Lastly, those whom you call Caluinists, either denie, or call
into question as few principles of Religion or Articles of Faith, as
any Romish Catholike: nay, I will be bold to say it, and readie
to make it good, that the former maintaine some of them
strongly, which the latter ouerthrow, if not in plaine termes
and directly, yet at least indirectly and by consequence, by
establishing their owne Articles: Vnknowne to the Apostles
and the Primitiue Church, they make the Articles of our Christian
Creede of none effect; and for exposition which concernes
not points in difference betweene vs, and the Church
of Rome, if I can iudge any thing, your Writers differ more among
themselues, and assume to themselues a greater libertie
in expounding then ours: and if they be restrained of their Allegoricall,
Tropologicall, and Anagogicall interpretations,
(as impertinent many times to the point in hand as wide from
the scope of the Text) they will presently cry out that wee despise
the authoritie of the Church, when it may be they haue

wrested the meaning of one or two latter Fathers against the
streame of Antiquitie; and what bond of obedience can there
be to God or to Kings for Gods sake in such Religion?

                  It is commonly obiected by States-men that it is no matter what
opinions men hold in matters of Religion, so that they be kept in awe
by Iustice and by the sword. Indeed for this world it were no matter
at all for Religion, if it were possible to doe Iustice and to keepe men
in awe by the Sword: In Militarie estates while the Sword is in the
hand there is the lesse need of Religion; and the greatest andYou seeme to meane the ancient Romanes, who made more conscience of an Oath (in which particular act of Religion you afterward insist) then the Romish Catholikes at this day. most
martiall estates that euer were, haue beene willing to vse the Conscience
and reuerence of some Religion or other, to prepare their
Subiects to obedience: but in a peaceable gouernment, such as all
Christian kingdomes doe professe to be if the reines of Religion bee
let loose, the sword commonly is too weake, and comes to late, and is
like enough to giue the day to the Rebell. And seeing the last and
strongest bond of iustice is an Oath, which is a principall act of Religion,
and were but a mockerie if it were not for the punishment of
Hell, and the reward of Heauen; it is vnpossible to execute iustice
without the helpe of Religion, and therefore the neglect and contempt
of Religion hath euer beene, and euer shalbe the forerunner of
destruction in all setled States whatsoeuer.

                  Hauing now spent your powder and shot in discharging
your three substantiall reasons, and the Apologizing of the
Powder-treason; for the filling vp of your paper, but to the abusing
of his Maiesties leisure and patience, you here begin a
fresh with a solemne discourse of the necessitie of Religion for a
well ordered Common-wealth, vnder colour of meeting with
an obiection of States-men, that it matters not what opinions

men hold in matters of Religion, so they bee kept in awe by iustice,
and by the sword: But these Statesmen I take to be of Machiauels
sect, who, of what nation he was by birth, and of what religion
by profession, wee are not ignorant. The ancient Romans
indeed being themselues. Lords of the world, became
vassals to the Idoles of all nations, by admitting the free vse of
their diuerse Religions of them all, holding that (as it seemeth)
the most perfect Religion, which refused none as false: neither
is the Turke much different from that opinion, howbeit hee
preferre his owne Religion before all others: but all other
States-men who are so conuersant in affaires of State, as
they neglect not Christanitie, can not but hold the Christian
religion alone, admittable in Christian Common-wealthes.
Now as we grant in all States some Religion necessary, and in
Christian States onely the Christian admittable: So with all
we confesse an Oath to bee a principall acte of that Religion:
But how it is abused by Romish Catholikes for seruing their
owne turnes, by Dispensations, by aequiuocations, and Mentall
Reseruations, both Histories witnesse, and wee haue had
too great experience: By which meanes that which indeede
should be the surest and strongest band of truth &amp; iustice, and
as the Apostle speakes, [Ebr. 6. 16. 
                     an end of all strife,] is become the matter
of quarrell, and a meere visard for iniustice and falshood to
maske vnder: and by the same meanes, as the Romish Religion
is growen odious to vs; so for their sakes, both ours and
theirs, (going both vnder the common name of Christians) is
in that respect growen odious to the very Turkes, who obserue
an oath made by the name of their Mahomet more inuiolably,
then wee by the Name of CHRIST one to another; as
well appeared by our King Henry the third, who being a
great exactor vpon the poore Commons, as euer was any king
before him, or since, and thinking thereby to winne the people
sooner to his deuotion, most faithfully promised them
once or twice, and thereunto bound himselfe with a solemne
oath, both before the Clergie and Laitie, to graunt vnto
them the old liberties and Customes of Magna Charta, and
Charta de Foresta, perpetually to bee obserued, whereupon

a Quindecim was granted to the King: but after the payment
was sure, the King trusting the Popes dispensation for a
little money to be discharged of his oath and couenant, went
from that he had promised, and solemnely sworne before. In
like manner the sayd King at another time being in neede of
money, signed himselfe with the crosse, pretending and swearing
deepely in the face of the whole Parliament, that hee
himselfe would goe in person against the Saracens: but as
soone as the money was fingred, small care was taken for the
performance of the oath, being so put in head by certaine about
him, that hee needed not to passe of that periurie, for
so much as the Pope for an hundred pounds or two, would
quickly discharge him thereof, as Matthew Parris reports
it, who liued at the same time, and was often in Court with him,
this was then the account (which by reason of the Popes easie
dispensations) Kings made of their oathes to their Subiects.
                  The like account by the same meanes did Charles the 9th.
of France and the Queene his mother make of their oath taken
to the King of Nauarre, the Prince of Condie, the Admirall,
and the rest of the Protestant profession, at what time his sisters
marriage was made more red with their blood then his
wine; but this blood crying for vengeance, himself at his death
issued blood at all the passages of his bodie: Neither did Subiects
make any other reckoning of their oathes, taken to their
Kings, if they had the like dispensations, or Kings to Kings, or
Subiects to subiects: And if this be not to make a meere mockery
of oathes (which should be madeIere. 4. 2. 
                     in trueth, in iudgment
and in iustice,) and consequently of religion, as if indeede
there were no punishment of Hell, no reward of heauen, I
conceiue not what is: and by your owne rule this contempt
of religion cannot but in time drawe on the destruction of
those States, which thus vnder pretence of religion and obedience
to their holy Father, neglect and contemne it. Lastly,
if they esteeme so little of oathes made one to another, what
should we expect at their hands, to whom they hold Faith is
not to bee held, bee it neuer so solemnely plighted: whereas

                     Gen. 21. 
                     Abraham made conscience of his oath taken to Abimelech,
andGen. 31. 
                     Iacob to Laban, both Idolaters; and so did they
againe, though Idolaters or Infidels, to Iacob and Abraham.
                  
                  But let such as maintaine that position, That faith giuen or
sworne to Heretikes or Infidels is not to bee held, call to minde
what successe it tooke at the battaile of Varna in Bulgaria, in
the yeere of our Lord 1404, what time Ladislaus the yong King
of Polony, by the dispensation of Pope Eugenius, and the perswasion
of Iulianus his Nuntio, broke his Oath and League
made with Amurath the second, Emperour of the Turkes: in
which battell the King (his horse being first killed vnder him)
was stricken downe and slaine, the Popes Bishops that were
in the field to incourage the souldiers, fleeing to saue themselues
fell into Bogges and Marishes, and there perished: Iulianus
the Cardinall, which with the Pope was the chiefe doer in
breaking the League, was found dead in the way, being full
of wounds, and spoyled to his naked skinne, and all the ditches
and trenches were filled with the blood of Christians:
A memorable spectacle of Gods vengeance vpon the breach
of oathes made euen to Infidels.

beginne with mens bodies, and with matters of State, but

Which words sound to me, as if the marke they shoot at, had

and so I thinke haue others, that few haue forsaken our Religion
to imbrace the Romane, but such as haue bene first in their

liues notoriously deboshed, or extremely thirstie and ambitious
of honour and preferment, beyond the opinion of other
men, and their owne desert. And whether more distorted engines
of actions be sent foorth from the arsenall of Romish apprehensions,
or English, in regarde of Religion, let the barbarous
Massacre of France, and the vntimely death of their two last
Henries, the often attempts vpon the person of our late happie
and famous Queene, and of late the damnable Powder-treason
intended against our gracious SOVERAIGNE and the State,
and lastly, the cruelty and ambition, the vnnaturall, and vnmeasurable
lust, euen of those nations which are most zealous of
the Popes greatnes, and are therefore accounted most Catholike,

                  It was a good answere which was returned by one of our
side to a pretended Catholike, demaunding what reason hee
had, not to imbrace that Religion: why saith hee? Because it
teacheth a man to eate his God, and kill his King. And in any Religion
whatsoeuer, it is not so much the knowledge of the
truth, which maketh an honest and happie man, as the practise
of that we know. The deuill himselfe when wee haue done
our best, will know more then we: howbeit it is certaine wee
must endeuour to know the will of God, before we can doe it,

of their Friers, who are commonly their most famous Preachers,
will vndoubtedly grant as much: Nothing so frequent
with them as fictions against Lutheranes, and Caluinists, of fables
out of their golden legend, deuised by leaden braines, and
vttered by brasen foreheads: whereas the word of God, the
only meanes of rightly informing the vnderstanding, and conuincing
the conscience, they either vse not at all, or very sparingly,

your selfe foresaw so much when you tell vs, you could not excuse
all Papists, though you would. And for mending the matter,
you presse vs with the authority of Sir Francis Bacons Essayes,
that all Schismatikes failing in the precepts of the first table, concerning
the worship of God, haue necessity in pollicie to make a good
shew of the second Table, by their ciuill and demure conuersation
towards men: But herein in my iudgement you doe that noble
and learned gentleman (as you deseruedly stile him) some iniury
in applying his obseruation (if it bee his) against the religion
which himselfe professeth: whereas in trueth it fits it
selfe more properly to your Romish Catholikes here at home
among vs, who pretend some of them great shew of morall
vertue and ciuill honesty, specially in matter of mortification
and charitable workes, whereas they mangle the precepts of
the first Table in their number, making of foure but three, and
of those three they breake the first and second, in worshipping
the Blessed Virgine, Angels, Saints, Reliques, Images with
diuine worship, and in speciall the Crucifix and Sacramentall
Bread, professedly with the same kind of worship which is due
to Christ as God, and what account they make of the other
two, their little reckoning of blaspheming and profaning
Gods Name, and Gods day, giue but too sufficient demonstration
to the world. But to bee plaine with you, I finde no
such words in Sir 
                     Francis Bacons Essayes printed the yere 1612.
I haue since found words to that purpose in his Meditation

one of religion, and that the very first which speakes so wittily,
so learnedly, so fully against your drift in this place, and the
former section, which shewes how the deuill out of the arsenall
of false apprehensions, sends forth the distorted engines of actions,
(they be his owne words in that place:) as I cannot but
hold it both a fence and a grace to insert it into mine answere
whole and intire, (as himselfe hath deliuered it:) lest I should
doe him iniury by mangling it.
                  [The quarrels and diuisions for religion,
(saith hee) were euils vnknowen to the heathen▪
and no maruell, for it is the true God

that is the ielous God, and the gods of the
heathen were good fellowes: but yet the
bounds of religious vnitie are so to bee
strengthened, that the bounds of humane
societie bee not dissolued. Lucretius the Poet
when hee beheld the acte of Agamemnon,
induring and assisting at the sacrifice of his
daughter, concludes with this verse,
Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum.
But what would hee haue done if hee had
knowen the Massacre of France, or the Powder
treason of England? Certainely hee
would haue been seuen times more Epicure
and Atheist then hee was: nay, hee would
rather haue chosen to haue been one of the
mad men of Munster; then a partaker of
those counsels: For it is better that Religion
should deface mens vnderstanding, then
their pietie and charitie, retaining reason
onely but as an Engine and Chariot-driuer

when the deuill sayd, I will ascend
and bee like the highest: but it is a greater
blasphemie, if they make God to say, I will
descend and bee like the Prince of darkenesse:
And it is no better, when they make

the cause of Religion descend to the execrable
actions of the murthering of Princes,
butchering of people, and firing of States;
neither is there such a sinne against the person
of the holy Ghost, (if one should take it
literally) as in stead of the likenesse of a
Doue, to bring him downe in the likenesse
of a Vulture or Rauen; nor such a scandall
to their Church, as out of the Barke of S.
Peter to set foorth the flagge of a Barge of
Pyrats and Assassins. Therefore since these
things are the common enemies of humane
society, Princes by their power, Churches
by their decrees, and all learning, Christian,
Morall, of whatsoeuer Sect or opinion, by
their Mercurie rodde, ought to ioyne in the
damning to Hell for euer these facts, and
their supports▪ and in all counsels concerning
Religion, that counsell of the Apostle
would be prefixed, [Ira hominis non implet
iustitiam Dei.]
                  
                  The same noble gentleman speaketh much to the same
purpose in his Essay of Superstition, as [that it erecteth an absolute

hee, of Superstition is the people, and in all superstition wise men
follow fooles, &amp; arguments are fitted to practise in a reuersed order.]
                     
And thus I hope by this time Mr. Doctor hath gained little to
the aduantage of his cause from the true and wise obseruations
of Sir Francis Bacon. Lastly, for your instance in Mutinous
souldiers, I cannot conceiue whither your discourse tends,
but to shew that more honestie is yet left amongst vs, then in
those of your profession, and is like to bee as long as we feare
the assault of a common enemie, which is like to bee as long
as you remaine in opinion and condition like your selues.

the next generation to the great preiudice and molestation of your

heauen or earth, mine owne soule or the seruice of your Maiestie,
God or your neighbours, or your subiects, my assured hope is that by
ioyning my selfe to the Catholike Church, I neither haue done nor
shall doe any ill duety or seruice vnto your Maiestie.

                  You say that our exhortations to obedience are ridiculous, the
vnderstanding being once infected with such principles of rebellion
as wee teach: Had you vouchsafed to haue stooped to the nominating
of those principles in particular, you had dealt ingenuously,
and giuen some matter of reply: but as you would
shew your selfe a polititian in the whole body of your discourse,
so doe you specially in this, that throughout you insist
vpon vniuersals, which not onely dazell the eyes of their
vulgar Reader, but yeelde starting holes of euasion to the authour.
What your Principles are, and what ours touching obedience
to the ciuill Magistrate, I haue already opened in
mine answer to the twelfth and thirteenth Sections of this Chapter.
Now the remedie, you say, to preuent the mischiefe likely
to ensue vpon such doctrine, is, the admission of Catholike religion,
as if wee neuer heard nor read of any rebellion abroad
nor at home raised from the professours of that religion during
the space of a thousand sixe hundred yeeres, for so long
you say hath it lasted, whereas in trueth, if that be true, where
our religion hath yeelded one rebell (to speake within compasse)
yours hath yeelded a thousand: and if the Principles of
our religion, as the case now stands, induce men to rebellion,
surely in common reason it should much rather doe so, if a
contrary be once admitted to confront it: So that whiles you
pretend to perswade his Maiestie to the safest course, you aduise
him in all likelihood to the most dangerous. Whether
his Maiestie then respect heauen or earth, his neighbours abroad
or his Subiects 
                        〈◊〉
                      home, his securest course will bee to
maintaine and allow that onely religion which he professeth,
and consequently in labouring to draw him to the contrary
you cannot but doe him very ill seruice.

                  But perhaps there is such opposition both in matter of doctrine
and matter of State, as it is impossible that euer there should be any
reconciliation at all betwixt the Church of England and the
Church of Rome; of which I humbly pray your Maiestie to giue
mee leaue to shew to you what I haue obserued.

meanes. For the first of which were we neuer so peaceably disposed,
yet such a stiffe auersenesse there is in the Romanists,
that they suffer not their adherents to ioyne with vs in any religious
exercise, against which notwithstanding themselues
can no way except. They excommunicate their Subiects
who trauell or traffique into our countreys; they straightly
charge them not to reade or keepe any of our Bookes,
though meerely tending to the practise of piety, no nor the

Emperors, hath carried away blowes on both sides, which it
seems Bellarmin in his 3. booke and 19. Chap. of Laiks, thought he

well deserued, helping to lay on loade vpon him. The second
thing that makes vs irreconcileable, is the qualitie of our controuersies,
they being not verball differences, as some would haue,
but materiall, and that of the highest nature, no lesse then the
redemption of mankind, and the iustification of a sinner, but

an inch, as stiffely maintaine, as wee iustly oppugne:
which the latest writings of their Iesuites haue giuen vs so
sufficient occasion (by aduancing and inlarging this power to
the vtmost) to bee confident of, that wee neede make no farther
doubt of that matter. The third thing which makes vs
irreconciliable is the difficultie in the meanes of reconcilement,
which in the iudgement of the wisest is in likelihood the definition
of a generall Councill, or nothing. But who shall call
this Councill? and prescribe the time and place of meeting,
and persons that shall meete? who shall sit as President in it?
what shall be the rule of disputing? and meanes of executing
what is determined? we shal need a former Councill to define.

and it is much increased by so long continuance: so that it was neuer
greater then it seemes to be at this day, nor neuer more dangerous
to deale withall. For if a man doe but goe about to stop it, there ariseth
presently a great and fearefull noise, and roaring of the waters
against him; but yet neuerthelesse the greatnesse of the noise ought
not to discourage vs; but rather to giue vs hope, that though it bee
wide, yet it is but shallow, and not farre from the bottome, as proceeding
from affection, which is sudden and violent, and not from iudgement,
which is quiet, constant, and alwayes like it selfe▪ For if a man

away to see it, yet haue we good reason to thanke God for it,
in as much as neither the deuil, nor the Pope, neither Rome nor
the gates of Hell with all their bloodie Persecutions, their holy
Leagues, and mischeiuous Combinations, could euer yet
preuaile against it: Nay hitherto, the more they haue laboured
to quench it, and trample it vnder foot, the more hath it
shined like a bright torch, and flourished as the Palme tree,
which the more it is pressed downe, the more it spreadeth.
Their blood hitherto hath prooued the seede of the Church,
and that which S. Augustine speakes of the first Christians
may be verified of them, [they were mangled, they were scourged,
they were stoned, they were burned, they were multiplied,] and
because you cannot with all your malice and power and policie
destroy it, we argue with Gamaliel that it is from God: neither
can you iustly call that sudden or violent, which as your
selfe before confesse hath now continued these many yeeres, and
hath increased by continuance, whereas sudden things in their
ordinary course, and by discourse of reason last little, and by
continuance rather decrease, it being proper only to naturall
motions to gather strength and fortifie themselues in going.
And for that great roaring of the waters which you pretend,
though it be a noise fearefull to you, yet to vs is it acceptable,
as being occasioned not so much from the shallownesse of the
waters themselues, as from the stoppings and opposition of

others, and their own concurrence, to remoue and beare down
by all lawfull meanes that which is opposed for the stopping of
their current.
                  But the reason which you adde why wee should thinke
them shallow, as proceeding rather from affection then iudgement,
is this, because if a man aske (you say) in cold blood, whether
a Roman Catholike may be saued, the most learned Churchman
will not denie it: Wherein if we be more charitable to you,
then you are to vs, in passing censures of damnation, it should
in my iudgement rather argue the goodnesse of that Religion
from whence such charity flowes towards mens persons, then
be vrged as a proofe for the approbation of that erronious doctrine,
which in it selfe it condemns. The Turke is too liberall
in admitting all Religions to the hope of saluation, and on the
other side you are too niggardly and sparing in shutting out
all from the hope thereof, which receiue not the marke of the
beast in their foreheads or hands. We desiring to runne a middle
course betwixt both extremes, as we shut out all such who
directly deny the merits of CHRIST: so doe wee passe a fauourable
censure on those who deny him not of malice, but of
ignorance, and that not directly but by consequence. It is
true that S. Paul hath in the fifth to the Galatians, [▪If yee be
circumcised CHRIST shall profit you nothing,] That is, if a man
put his trust in Circumcision, or in any thing else beside Christ,
(though with Christ) in the matter of iustification, he is abolished
from Christ, and the merite of his death and Passion.
Now what confidence the Romanists put in their owne satisfaction
for veniall sinnes and temporall punishment, either in
this life or in Purgatorie, due to mortall, their writings testifie:
but yet our assurance is, that many of them when they
come to make their last account betwixt God and their owne
Conscience, and throughly consider of the weakenesse and
corruption of their owne nature, for the vncertaintie of their
owne proper righteousnesse, and for the auoiding of vaineglory, according
to Bellarmins aduise,Lib. 5 de Iusti
                           •
                        . cap. 7. 
                     they rest wholly in the alone mercie
and goodnesse of God, renouncing in particular that merite of
worke which their Church in generall for her owne aduantage

maintaineth, and teacheth them to maintaine. Or lastly God of
his Graciousnesse may accept of their repentance for vnknowen
sins, and consequently for their erronious opinons, which
by reason of their education they vnwittingly imbrace; yet
this charitable construction of ours can bee no sufficient warrant
for vs, either to shut our eyes against a knowen trueth, or
to open our eares to hearken to any motion of reconcilement
to a knowen errour.
                  Now whether a Romane Catholike may bee a good subiect,
wholly submitting himselfe to Romish positions, I referre the
reader to his Maiesties speech in Parliament in the yeere 1605
(who should know what belongs to his owne state) and to
mine answere, to the 12. Sect. of this Chapter; a part of his
Maiesties very words in that speech are these: [I therefore doe
thus conclude this point, that as vpon the one part many honest men
seduced with some errors of Popery, may yet remaine good &amp; faithfull
subiects:
                     Of this ranke was M. Doctour, as appeareth in the 19. Sect. of his first Chap. where he promiseth to iustifie all the present doctrine of the Church of Rome from point to point. 
                     so vpon the other part none of those that truely knowe
and beleeue the whole grounds and schoole conclusions of their doctrine,
can euer prooue good Christians or faithfull subiects.]
If then we bee so farre diuided both in God and in the king,
how can we but be vtterly diuided in our selues?

                  You farther endeuour to prooue in the entrance of this Section,
that the diuision of the Church of England from the Church
of Rome ariseth rather from affection then iudgement, in as much
as the multitude doth seldome or neuer iudge according to trueth:
but according vnto customes. Now whether it be the Church of
England or the Church of Rome that stands vpon multitude,
and that multitude vpon custome, the Bishop of Rome himselfe
shall be the iudge; nay not onely your multitude, but the
chiefest pillars of your Church stand most vpon it: if you had
but looked into your greatLib. 4. de mili. Eccles. cap. 5. 
                     Cardinals notes of your Church,
you should haue found antiquity or custome to haue beene the

made the Indians standing vpon their customes, the chiefe
difficulty of their conuersion to CHRIST. It was Symmachus
the Pagans argument in his Epistle to Theodosius the Emperour,
recorded byLib. 5. epist. 30. S. Ambrose: [Seruanda est tot saeculis fides

nostra, &amp; sequendi sunt maiores nostri, qui secuti sunt foeliciter suos.
Our religion which hath now continued so many yeeres is still to bee
retained, and our ancestours are to bee followed by vs, who happily
traced the steps of their forefathers;] and is not this Mr. Doctors
owne argument to perswade his Maiesty to the Romish religion
in the 2. and 10. Sect. of this Chapter, how comes it then
to passe that in this place he findes fault with those that iudge
according to custome, and makes it a popular errour? teach
that a while, and indeed we may be brought to shake handes
with Rome, she standing vpon a pretended truth of antiquity,
but we vpon the antiquity of trueth, in as much as our Sauiour
said not, I am antiquity, but I am trueth: And S. Cyprian his
blessed Martyr, Antiquity without truth, is nothing els but ancient
errour. Now the reason you giue that our multitude iudge
according to custome, is because that they beeing bred and
brought vp in the hatred of Spaniards and Papists, can not choose
but thinke they are bound to hate them still. Wee might giue the
same reason with more shew of truth, of your multitude, trained
vp in the hatred of those who you call Lutheranes and Caluinists,
whom they are taught to hate more then ours, either a
Spaniard or Papist; which two, what reason you haue to couple
together, I vnderstand not, except it be to iustifie the front of

sets forth Rome as the Sunne, with this inscription, Luminare

conquerour, and vnder the other Spaine as a warriour, both
supporting betweene them the ball of the world, vnder which

and not vnlikely Mr. Doctor, when he thus ioyned Spaniards
and Papists together, might secretly ayme at some such
matter, and yet are not the Pope and the Spaniard so firmely
vnited betweene themselues, but that Charles the V. was content
to winke (at least) at the sacking of Rome by Charles Burbon,
then vnder his pay: and Phillip the II. his sonne, being one
of the pretenders to the Crowne of Portugall, refused to stand
to his Holinesse arbitrement in the decision of that controuersie:
and they both while they liued were, and this present king
yerely is accursed, at least inclusiuely, for withholding the kingdomes
of Naples and Sicilie, as being of right, parts of S. Peters
patrimonie.
                  But all that is obiected against the Papists or Spaniards, are
in your account the falsifications and slanders of puritanicall Preachers,
howbeit, who they are that labour by that meanes to
disgrace their opposites, let the Pictures forged and printed,
of our fained persecutions, in couering your Catholikes with
Beares skinnes, and baiting them with dogs testifie, and your
reports which my selfe haue heard from your Friers in their
Pulpits of our strange barbarisme, as well in manners as religion,
as if no sparke of ciuilitie, or knowledge of God, were
left amongst vs. It is your practise, if not your doctrine, Calumniare
audacter, semper aliquid haeret: Bee bold to lay on loade
with slandering, somwhat will alwaies sticke to; though the wound
be closed and cured, some scarre will euer remaine: though a
man purge himselfe neuer so sufficiently, yet such is the nature
of slander, that it runnes faster, and spreads farther then
the purgation. Many who heard the one, neuer heard of
the other; or if they heard it, through malice and naturall
corruption they more willingly hold fast and entertaine the
one, then the other. I haue heard it credibly reported, that a
Spaniard comming to Oxford, and seeing the Trinitie pictured
(long agoe) in the Diuinitie schoole window, he wondred
at it, considering hee had been taught by their Preachers that
wee denied and blasphemed the Trinitie. And here the Pamphlet

written and published of Bezaes death and reuolt, which
himselfe liued to answere with Bezarediuiuus, though it bee
famously knowen, yet it is not amisse to reuiue it, being so notable
and shamelesse an imposture.
                  Touching your motion to his Maiestie for the silencing
of those Preachers, vpon whom, for speaking freely against
the abuses of the Church of Rome, you bestow the liuerie of
Make-bates, it is not vnlike for the manner of it to Philips capitulating
with the Athenians, that for the better negotiating
of a peace, they would be content for a while to deliuer ouer
their Orators into his custodie: But Demosthenes finding himselfe
to be chiefly interessed in that businesse, told his citizens
that it was as much, as if the woolues should desire to haue the dogs
in their keeping that guarded the sheepe. His Holinesse may permit
and countenance, and by rewards incourage his Iesuites
and Friars to speake and write what they list of Kings &amp; Princes,
and namely, of his Maiestie, our most renowmed Soueraigne,
(witnesse the railings and slanders of Pacenius, Christanouie,
Becanus, Coquaeus, Eudaemon, Schoppius, Rebullus, Parsons,
Coffeteau, Peletier, Gretser,) their pennes may walke at
libertie, their tongues are theirs they ought to speake, what Lord
shall them controll: But his Maiestie shall doe well to bridle and restraine
his most painefull and duetifull Ministers, who stand
in the watch-tower, and keepe Sentinell to discrie the incursions
of the enemie, and to discouer such false Prophets as come
to vs in sheepes clothing, but within are rauening woolues:
or if they bee not silenced, they must say nothing but what they
are able to prooue by sufficient authority, before those that are able
to iudge; as if our Bishops were ignorant that it belonged to
their charge to take notice of the preaching of vnsound doctrine
within their Diocesse, and accordingly to censure it,
or knowing what is their duety in that behalfe, they were
more vnwilling or vnable to performe it, then Doctor Carier,
and his Colledge of Critickes; and in the meane time a conference
must be had of learned and moderate men on either side, such
belike as your selfe, like Metius Suffetius, luke-warme, halting
betwixt two opinions, rowing to the shore and looking

to the Sea, holding with the hare and running with the hound,
who publikely pray for the King, and priuately worke for the
Pope: true learning we reuerence, and Christian moderation
we highly esteeme; but1. Tim. 6. 20. 
                     Science falsely so called, bent to the
patronage of falsehood and neutralitie, vnder the vizard of
moderation, to the reconciling of error to trueth, is but the abusing
of faire and honourable Titles, to base and malicious
ends, which imputation you labour to fasten vpō vs, as if by the
light of the Gospel we held the people in extreme ignorance, wheras
the Prophet Dauid tels vs, thatPsal. 119. 105. 
                     the word of the Lord was a

                     You
haue a most sure word of the Prophet, to which you doe well that you
take heede as vnto a light that shineth in a darke place; but you
beare vs in hand, that the light of the Gospel holds men in extreame
ignorance. Zachary prophesied of his

                     onne the Baptist, that

the shadow of death, to guide their feete into the way of peace, and
the Baptist himselfe of CHRIST, that he wasIohn 1. 9. 
                     that true Light
which lighteth euery man that commeth into the world: But you
tell vs, that it serues to dazell mens eyes, and rob their purses: And
no doubt, had you liued among the Pharisees in the time of
CHRIST, or Iohn the Baptist, you would haue called their doctrine
a counterfeit light in a theeues lanterne, aswel as ours, being
in substance the same with theirs. And for ignorance, I
may bee bolde to say it, with a thankefull acknowledgement
to God for it, that a good part of our people are more expert
in the Scriptures, and are better able to yeeld an account of
that faith which is in them, then many of your Prelates and
Priests, whereof some beare the name of the brotherhood of ignorance,
and all (at least by your practise) acknowledge her the
mother of deuotion, in as much as youRom. 1. 18. 
                     withhold the trueth in vnrighteousnesse:
like Esopes dog, you neither eate hay your selues
nor suffer others to eate it: You pretend the key of Knowledge,
but you neither enter in your selues nor suffer others to
enter; you neither reade nor esteem the Scriptures your selues
as you ought, nor suffer the people to reade them, but seale
them vp in an vnknown language to the vse of a few, with whō
you please to dispense.

(howbeit you seeme onely to glance at it in passage, and to
draw it on vpon the bye) which is to put vs off from all fellowship
and communion with those Churches, who acknowledge
Caluin to haue beene an excellent instrument of God, in the abolishing
and suppressing of Poperie, and the clearing and
spreading of his trueth, that so being separated from them, we
may either stand single and be encountred alone, or returne againe
to our old bias, and relaps vpon Rome, and so through
Caluins sides you strike at the throat and heart of our Religion:
For our parts, we all wish with the Reuerend &amp; learnedMy Lord of Ely. Prelate

Caluins, whō we esteeme as a worthy man, but a man, and consequently
subiect to humane error, and frailtie. We maintaine
nothing with him because he affirmes it, but because from infallible
grounds he proues it; whereas the Popes bare assertion
with you is proofe sufficient. You are so sworne to his words,
that they are of equal or higher authoritie with you then Pythagoras
his precepts with his Schollers, ipse dixit, is enough for
your warrant: but for vs, we imbrace Caluin as himselfe doth
authors not diuine, vsque ad aras, so farre foorth as with diuine
hee accordeth, and no farther. This is our iudgement of
Caluin: but to say that the doctrine which he maintaines, is as
much against the Religion of England, as it is against that of
Rome, is a desperate assertion, and such as can neuer be made
good, did all our fugitiues lay their heads together, and were
all their wits turned into one. And I much meruaile what you
meant, pretending so much tendernesse of conscience, and diligence
in search of the trueth, to suffer your malice so farre to
preuaile vpon your iudgment, as to let so foule a blot, so manifest
a falshood to drop from your pen, and not only so; but to

present it to the scanning of so learned a Prince, and to publish
it to the view and censure of the world: For if Caluins doctrine
bee as opposite to our Religion as to the Romish, then
must it needs follow that either ours and the Romish agree in
one: or that ours is as distant from Caluins as Caluins is from
the Romish; both which to bee vntrue appeares aswell by the
testimonie of all other Romish writers, and the authority of
the Pope himselfe in hisThe words of the Bull are these, Impia mysteria &amp; instituta ad Caluini praescriptum à se suscepta &amp; obseruata etiam à sub ditis s

I haue in mine hands Letters written frō 
                        Beza to Archbishop Whitgift, and from him againe to Beza, wherein they both acknowledge that we agree in the substance of true religion. Letters by them written, and Bookes dedicated to our late
blessed Queene, our Bishops and Noble men, by French and
Heluetian Diuines, specially of Zurich and Basil, testifie to the
world, that they then held their religion to bee the same with
ours, and ours with theirs: and for any thing I know, neither
theirs nor ours is since changed, saue onely some such neutrals
as your selfe labour to drawe vs neerer to Rome then they
can bee drawen, or the trueth it selfe will permit that wee
should.
                  Among many other testimonies I will onely instance in
two, the one an Heluetian touching our conformitie with
forreine reformed Churches in former times, the other a
French man touching the present: the Heluetian is Bullinger,
who dedicating his Commentaries vpon Daniel to Horne, Bishop
of Winchester▪ Iewell, Bishop of Salisbury, Sandes, Bishop of
Worcester, Parkhurst, Bishop of Norwich, and Pilkington, Bishop
of Durham, in his Epistle Dedicatory professeth hee did it
chiefly to this ende, that posterity might vnderstand their indissoluble
knot of friendship, and the mutual consent betweene England
and Suisserland in matter of Religion, howbeit they were remooued
farre asunder in situation of place. The French is Peter Moulin,
who in defence of his Maiesties Booke against Coffeteau
acknowledgeth that wee had enough sufficient men of our owne to
defend the Cause, but that hee vndertooke the worke to let the
world knowe, that the same Confession which his Maiestie had

made was also theirs, and that they and the trueth were assailed
in his Person and Writings.
                  
                  But what neede I stand vpon the particular testimonies of
priuate men, since the Confessions of our Churches are extant
to be compared, as well in the Booke, intituled, The Harmony,
as in that other termed The bodie of Confessions? In the meane
time to giue the Reader some satisfaction, I will set downe
the doctrine of the Church of England in points of difference
together with Caluint on the one side of it, and the Romish
on the other, that so wee may make some estimate whether
Caluinisme bee as opposite to the Religion of England, as to
that of Rome. Now for the doctrine of the Church of England,
I will not extend it so wide as to the Bookes and Lectures of
our Bishops, and publique professours, the lights and guides
of our Church and Vniuersities, nor yet contract and confine
it, as Mr. Doctor doeth, within the narrow compasse of the
Common prayer Booke and Church Catechisme, the booke of
Canons, and therein Nowels Catechisme, Can. 79. being confirmed
and allowed by publike authoritie. But aboue all I
very much maruell Mr. Doctors memory should so farre faile
him, as quite and cleane to forget the Booke of Articles, solemnely
agreed vpon by the Reuerend Bishops and Clergie
of this kingdome, at two seuerall meetings or Conuocations
of theirs in the yeeres of our Lord 1562, and againe 1604,
and lately againe confirmed by two seuerall Canons, the 5, and
36 in number, since himselfe subscribed to them at the taking
of his Orders, if not of his Degrees, and liuing a long
time as Chaplen in house with Archbishop Whitegift, and
since keeping his ordinary turnes of waiting at Court, and
residence at Canterbury, he could not bee ignorant of them,
nay, I can shewe it vnder his owne hand, which argues hee
fought against the light of his owne conscience, that setting
downe the differences betweene the Olde English, and
New French diuinitie, as he calles it, hee quotes diuers of
those Articles for the doctrine of the Church of England, and
besides, professing himselfe so skilfull in the Statutes,Eliz. 13. he
could not but knowe that The Booke of Articles and Iniunctions,

we haue hereof well neere, as Writers since the last 600. yeres:
as many cleere testimonies as there be leaues in Mat. Paris, the
most learned and sufficient Writer (vnlesse you will except
William of Malmesburie) that those times afforded. It was a
memorable speech of Robert Grosteed Bishop of Lincolne, who
liued 358. yeres since, in the time of Gregory the IX. Caelestine
the IIII. Innocent the IIII. and Alexander the VI. who lying
vpon his death-bed, the very night of his departure, making
a lamentable and bitter complaint to the Priests and Monkes
that stood about him, of the miserable estate of the Church,
and laying the burthen of so great a mischiefe vpon the Popes
shoulders (whom therefore he called Heretike and Antichrist)
at length hee yeelded vp his soule vnto God with these
words in his mouth, [Non liberabitur Eccles

nisi in ore gladij cruentandi. The Church will neuer bee freed
from this Egyptian slauery, but by the point of a bloodie sword.]
Thus did this holy man foresee and foretel, as it were by a Prophetical
Spirit, that which we see accōplished: So that Henrie
the VIII. serued onely as a midwife to bring to the world that
birth, wherewith our countrey had bene in trauell many yeres
before; and had not he bene borne, some other meanes would
haue beene found out for the doing of that which he did; and
what we see already done in England, will also vndoubtedly be
brought to passe in other Nations, when their measure is full,
and God will. In the meane time that the trueth of this assertion
may the better appeare, I will adde to those examples,
and instances brought to this purpose by his Maiestie in his

                     The Abbies and Religious houses were growen to that
height of idlenesse, the mother of ignorance and luxurie, within
themselues, and by reason thereof into that contempt and
base estimation with the people, that it was high time some
blood should haue beene drawen from their swelling veines;
specially considering the little vse the Common-wealth had
of them, but chiefely for that they were so farre degenerated
from the primitiue institution: Their number was great, it
being 645. monasteries of men and women, accounting the
Priories and Frieries, besides Chaunteries and free Chappels;

their seate commonly in the fairest and fattest part of the land,
their reuenues amounting to an inestimable summe, as in the
originall booke thereof taken by Commission, and giuen to
the King may appeare; though at their dissolutions their values
were fauourably and farre vnder rated, in so much as in
the raigne of Edward the first, a statute of Mortmaine was
made for the restraining of that excesse: And had not Henry
the fifth beene wisely diuerted vpon the French warres by
Archbishop Chichly, he had in all likelihood preuented Henry
the eight in diminishing, if not demolishing those houses; being

King, and suffice for the maintenance of fifteene Earles, fifteene

and besides all this to the Kings Coffers, there would thereby

Cardinall Wolsey was the man who by pulling downe the smaller,
both shewed and made a way to the King, Henry the eight,
for taking the like order with the bigger.
                  Neither did hee thinke his hands lesse bound towards his
owne subiects, then the Pope and French King did theirs, for

those that intirely embraced that Religion, not so much as one
was found that could be drawen to disgorge those sweet morsels
they had deuoured, or to make restitution of a foote of

on) had offered all she held in possession.
                  Then was your doctrine of good workes, your Inuocation
Saints, your sacrifice of the Altar, and your prayer for the
dead restored, which were the grounds (you say) of those religious
houses: yet the land which had bene their maintenance,
was not restored. And as the reuiuing of those doctrines could
not serue to giue new life vnto the carkasses of those ruined
houses, so the ruining of those houses was not the cause (as you
pretend) of the impugning of those doctrines, since they were
impugned (by the confession of your owne Writers) by the
Waldenses, by the Albingenses, by Wicliffe, by Husse, by Luther,
by Zuinglius, by Caluin, before those houses fell, and
continued for the most part, during all the raigne of Henry the
eight, as may appeare by the sixe articles, commonly called the
whip with the sixe cordes. And for any thing I finde▪ he altered
nothing (excepting the taking downe of Monasteries and the
Popes authority) but onely the translation of the Bible, and
the singing and reading diuine seruice in our mother tongue:
so that it is cleare to any indifferent iudgement, that the contradicting
of those doctrines rather caused the ruine of those houses,
then their ruine (as you would beare vs in hand) the contradicting

of those doctrines. And it were no hard matter,
not by shew of Scripture, but by Scripture it selfe, to prooue
their vnsoundnesse: But an harder I am sure it were, for his Holinesse

                  The Commons might haue beene disburdened of their Subsidies,
had those reuenues and treasures which came, or might
haue come to the Crowne by the downefall of monasteries,
bene imployed as they might haue bene: the plates and wires
of gold of Beckets onely shrine, together with the pearles and
precious stones of inestimable value, filling two great chests:
But God so ordered the matter for their laying of sacrilegious

hands, (as it may be thought) vpon those tenths which by
himselfe were consecrated to himselfe, that neither it, nor the
rest prospered, neither was the king thereby much inriched,
nor the Commons relieued, it beeing like the dead flie in the
boxe of oyntment, or the Colloquintida in the Prophets pottage.
Now for the peoples liberty in making lawes at their own
pleasure, to liue as they listed, it is a matter fondly surmised
and published of you, not promised by the State, nor demanded
or expected by them. The Lawes Ecclesiasticall were in
King Henries time, and by his authority appoynted to be compiled
and digested, by a certaine company of Bishops and other
diuines ioyned in Commission, with Ciuill and Canon-Lawyers,
to the number of 32. but this worke being le

by the death of that king, was afterward finished in
the dayes, and by the command of his sonne Edward, which
my selfe haue seene, though by the vntimely death of that king
also, it neuer yet receiued publike allowance. And for other
lawes, as the world knoweth, they neither could nor can make
any without the consent of the Lords spirituall and temporall,
and the approbation of the king. And lastly how the lawes of
your Church crossed their affections, let their often and dangerous
rebellions for the restoring of them testifie, there beeing
none in trueth more fitting to the humour of a natural minded
man, as may appeare by this, that a man of no religion, and like
white paper, or sponged tables apt to receiue any impression,
will sooner imbrace yours, then any other in the world.
                  From this you digresse to their studying of the Scriptures, that
they might be able to confute confession, satisfaction, penance, and to
declaime against that tyranny of the Church, whereby themselues
and their forefathers had bene kept in awe and obedience to God and
their king. For their studying of the Scriptures, it is indeede a
great eye-sore to you, because thereby your malice in withholding
your followers from reading them, and withall your
burdensome traditions thrust vpon them for your owne honor
and gaine, but to their paine and grieuance, are clearely discouered
and discerned, from that which before you call eternall
trueth; but to them nothing can bee more profitable, or to

their guides more comfortable, so it bee done with reuerence

                        •
                     obriety, and (as our Preface to the Bishops Bible exhorts)
[not so much to dispute and contradict, as to learne and obey]
as being a practise which both our Sauiour himselfe, and his
Apostles, and the holy Fathers of the Primitiue Church, (specially
S. Chrysostome) in diuers homilies often and earnestly exhort
their heares vnto. And for the confutation of those
poyntes you name, I am of opinion (and I thinke not without
reason) that many of our people are better able by Scriptures
to confute them, as they are now held and vsed amongst you,
then your greatest Bishops and Cardinals are from thence able
to proue them, of whom some haue not sticked to professe
that they thought that time which they passed in reading the
Scriptures to be of all other the most vnprofitably spent, preferring
Tullies Orations before Pauls Epistles, and Aristotles Ethikes
before Solomons Prouerbes.

                  Little hope was there giuen for the present to the Churchmen

they all (Rochester onely excepted) ioyntly concurring with
the king in casting off the Romish yoke: and for their marrying

Cambden, an vnpartiall Antiquarie, Churchmen were not

Vowes, but the rashnesse of them, and impossibilitie in performing
them: Not against true Virginity; but the fained shew of
it, and the preferring it by so many degrees before the honourable
estate of mariage: Not against necessary Pouertie, but the
voluntarie choise of it, when more good may be done by possessing
and vsing those meanes God hath sent vs: Not against
Fasting; but the pharesaicall vse of it, and making it part of diuine
worship: Not against Praying; but the performance of it
in a strange tongue, rather for custome then for conscience,
rather by number then by weight, in drawing neere vnto God
with our lippes, when our hearts are farre from him: Not against
Watching; but the pretended apish imitation and merit
in it: Not against Obedience; but the abuse of it in the enterprising
of damnable and desperate attempts. Lastly, not against
austeritie of life; but inciuilitie, and that shew of wisedome
which S. Paul censureth in the second to the Col. Consisting
in voluntary Religion and humblenesse of minde, and not sparing
the bodie. You doe well to adde that all these are required
in a Monasticall conuersation, but how they were or are
performed, God knowes, and the world not vndeseruedly
suspects.

                  Vpon these conditions, the Lords, the Commons, and the Clergie
were content to beleeue, that the King was Supreme head of the
Church of England: Not that they did thinke so indeed, or that
they desired to augment his authoritie; but that they might bee protected
by him, &amp; freely enioy those commodities which they thought
schisme had brought vnto them, and feared the vnity of the Church
might againe take from them: Hence did arise a necessitie of inueighing
against the Pope and the Church of Rome, as against
Antichrist and Babylon, and the greatest enemies of the State of
England: Insomuch that that Clergie man was most acceptable to
them, and in their opinion most worthy of preferments, that could
most confidently preach and write the most foule and monstrous assertions
of the Pope, and the Church of Rome, though they were
neuer so false.Those doctrines being set on foote, and maintained (as I haue shewed before) long before our diuision from Rome, might well cause it; but could not be caused by it. These and such like are those temporall respects,
which would faine seeme the daughters of those doctrines which
themselues haue brought foorth, and to be diuided from the Catholike
Church by doctrine, when they themselues haue caused the doctrine
of diuision.

                     Vpon these conditions, you say, that the Lords, and Commons,
and Clergie, were content to beleeue, that the King
was supreame head of the Church of England, whereas your
selfe before confesse, that these conditions were afterward
graunted to the Clergie, who notwithstanding, were the forwardest
in perswading the King to accept and assume that title,
as may appeare by the booke set out by the whole Conuocation
of England, intituled, The Institution of a Christian man, besides
the Treatises of diuers particular Bishops to the same purpose,
as namely Stephen Gardiners discourse of true obedience, together
with Bonners Preface annexed to it, Longelands Sermon,
and Tunstals Letter to Cardinall Poole, all which are extant to

be reade and seene at this day, and surely he that shall obserue
their vehement protestations, specially of Gardiner, whom I
hold the most sufficient among them for learning, and withall
the soundnesse and weight of the reasons, which they enforce
against the Popes pretended iurisdiction, will easily beleeue,
that they thought in very deede as they wrote, that their minds
and their pennes concurred in one. But from hence (you say)
arose a necessitie of enuying against the Pope and the Church of
Rome, as against Antichrist and Babylon, as if his Holinesse had
neuer beene graced with the title of Antichrist, before Henry
assumed his title of supreame head; nor Rome called Babylon before
England was freed from that Babylonish captiuity. Whereas
your famous Cardinall hath none other proofe from Scripture,
that S. Peter was euer at Rome, but by expounding Rome
to be the Babylon, from whence he dated his first Epistle: And
when the seuerall markes of Antichrist shall be applied to any
so properly, as to the Bishop of Rome, I will confesse he is iniuriously
so styled; in the meane time, I can hardly imagine any
so foule and monstrous assertions, which some of your Popes
haue not deserued, euen by the confession of your owne Writers,
it being enough to make a modest man blush in reading,
and relating that which they blushed not to act, nay boasted
of being acted: in so much as I doubt not, but I may confidently
affirme, that neither the Catalogue of Emperours, taking in
the Heathenish among the Christians, nor any one succession
of Kings in the world, since the first creation of it to this present

great countenance and encouragement from Geneua: For although
M. Iohn Caluin were neuer any good subiect, or friend to Bishop,

censure vpon Geneua and Caluin, in as much as from them wee

haue receiued great countenance and encouragement; whereas
neither Geneua nor Caluin were either of them of so much
greatnesse, as to afford vs any great countenance. Yet for Geneua
may truly thus much bee said, euen out of the mouth of
Bodin a professed enemie in religion,Method. hist. cap. 6. that neither drunkennesse,
nor idlenesse, nor professed Beggerie, nor open wantonnesse were to
be found in that Citie, and that it flourished not so much in riches
and power, as in piety and vertue, which God himselfe by strange
and miraculous deliuerances of them at sundry times, hath in
some fort testified to the world: Howbeit as a worthy Knight
hath well obserued, [the Friars would make their followers
beleeue, that it is aboue all other places a professed retreat and

in their religion, where their aduancement hath beene

who stood vpon his state, and caried a Mint about him, to repaire
thither to haue stamps made him for the coyning of Pistolets:

was, that he vnderstood their Citie was free, and gaue receite

that hauing so diligently read S. Augustine, and so highly
esteeming him, you should haue such a tooth against Caluine,
who professeth of S. Augustine in the latter end of his Chapter
of the Sacraments in generall, that he often quoted him [vt optimum,
&amp; ex tota antiquitate fidelissimum testem] as the best
and soundest witnesse which antiquity afforded: and he might
wel say he quoted him often, there being no Tome, &amp; scarcely
any one booke of Augustines, out of which Caluine through
the foure bookes of his Institutions, cites not many passages
to the number of 280. if my computation faile not: and
for the greatest part so iudiciously to the purpose, that
I may well doubt, or rather indeed not doubt at all whether
Mr. Caluin or Dr. Carrier had read S. Augustine with the
greater attention and iudgment: And for their knowledge in
Scriptures, I am sure malice it selfe will easily acknowledge,
there was no comparison. Dr. Stapleton who was not otherwise
very fauourable to Caluin, yet sends this testimony after
him in the Preface of his Antidote against Caluins exposition
of the Acts of the Apostles, [that his Commentary on that
booke was most elaborat, and his disputations acute and accurate]
and in another place [for the literall sense hee is a diligent
interpretour, so morall, so elegant, so sweet, that hee is

makes no bones to borrow almost whole pages from Caluin, as
may appeare to any that please to compare their expositions
on the second chapter to Titus, the 11. and 12. verses, a taste
whereof I will here present vnto the readers view;

                  From this collation we cannot but inferre, as one doth of
Plato, and Philo the Iew, vel Philonizat Plato, vel Platonizat
Philo, and another of Ramus and Viues, aut Ramizat Viues,
aut Viuizat Ramus: so of Caluin and Salmeron, aut Salmeron
Caluinizat, aut Caluinus Salmeronizat; either Salmeron borrowes
from Caluin, or Caluin from Salmeron, it beeing in my

apprehension (without the helpe of a miracle) vtterly impossible,
and consequently incredible, that two men should fall so
neere vpon the same conceptions and wordes, without the
sight one of anothers writings, now that Salmeron is the borrower,
and not Caluin, it appeares from hence that in his exposition
of the 10. verse of the third Chapter of the same Epistle,
he mentioneth Marlorates Commentary on that place,
which was compiled out of the Comments of diuers other
learned men, but specially out of Caluins; besides Caluin died
in the yeere 1564. as Beza witnesseth, and Salmeron in the
yeere 1595. as Ribadineira hath left it vpon record: So that it
might well be, and I verily thinke it was so, that Caluin was
dead many yeeres before Salmeron set vpon this exposition of
the Epistles, specially of that to Titus, which among his sixteene
seuerall Tomes is ranged in the last saue one: So that it
seemes he wrote it not long before his death, and consequently
many yeeres after Caluin was dead. Lastly the vniformity
of the style, and the tenour of writing plainely discouers that
Caluin was the creditour, and Salmeron the debtor, or rather

proposeth diuers questions touching the Church, and
the gouernement against Luther and Caluin, by name. Now
for Maldonate and Iansenius, though they colour the matter
more cunningly in the change of words, yet are they nothing
lesse beholding to Caluin in many places for the sence: And
thus we see how out of the mouthes and pennes of those, who
for reputation of learning were farre aboue, and for bitternesse
of malice were nothing inferiour to Dr. Carrier. Caluins rare
and singular gifts are truely acknowledged.
                  But he was neuer (you say) any good subiect or friend, to Bishop,
Duke or King: It was the same imputation which by the Iewes
was cast vpon Christ; and by the Pagans vpon the Christians,
in the Primitiue Church, as may appeare in Tertullians apology

for them deliuered by him to the Empero

                     rs Seuerus and Antoninus;
a great part whereof is spent in wiping off that aspersion,
and therefore Caluin may beare it at your hands with the
greater patience. Against the state of Bishops, if he any where
write otherwise then becomes him, we may well impute it to
his zeale against the great abuse of that order in the Romane
hierarchie, and his desire of establishing his owne discipline,
which though he did well to erect at Geneua (as being a kinde
of gouernment most fit for that city;) yet to shew that wee
make him no god, we professe he did ill in imposing it as necessary
on all other Churches. What friend hee was to Kings,
beside infinite other passages through his voluminous writings,
his onely Epistle to Francis the French king, prefixed to
his Institutions, doth sufficiently declare, which (as Beza not
without good reason thinketh) if that king had but read, it
would haue occasioned the giuing of some deepe wound to
the whore of Babylon, hee being not of the humour of those
kings that followed after him in the kingdome, but a sharpe
censurer, of a deepe iudgement, a great patrone of learning,
and of himselfe not auerse from that side, and though in his
Commentaries vpon Amos, he seeme to mislike Henry the 8th.
his title of Supreame Head, which by Stephen Gardiner and other
sycophants of Court, was then interpreted to spread as farre,
&amp; include as ample power as that he had taken from the Pope,
yet the lawfull Supremacie of kings, he both alloweth and defendeth,
as his Maiesty truely witnesseth for him in his Catalogue
of Tortus lies annexed to his Premonition, and therein hee
sheweth himselfe a better friend to kings, then D. Carrier was
when he thus passed his censure on him; for though hee often
dranke to his Maiesties health, as he professeth in a letter which
he thought worthy the imparting to all well minded Catholikes;
yet withall hee laboured by might and maine to readuance
and reestablish his authority amongst vs, who hath professedly
crossed and dashed the taking of that oath, by which is
onely testified that naturall allegiance which we owe his Maiestie.

and old men more cold and remisse, but withall more
wary and circumspect, according to that of S. Ierome in one
of his Epistles to S Augustine, Bos lassus fortius figit pedem,
The aduice of an old man is commōly best, but the execution
of young: The former haue alwayes beene accounted fitter
for setled businesse, but the latter for new enterprises, in as
much as men of age commonly obiect too much, consult too
long, aduenture too little, repent too soone, and seldome driue
businesse home to the full periode; but content themselues
with a mediocritie of successe, as louing to sleepe in whole
skinne. I am not of that Rabbyes mind, who because in Scripture
[Yong men are sayed to see visions, and old men to dreame
dreames,] thereupon inferreth, that young men are admitted
neerer to God then olde, because vision is a clearer reuelation
then a dreame: But yet experience teacheth vs, and a noble
Gentleman before named, hath rightly obserued it, that the
more a man drinketh of the world, the more it intoxicateth, and age
doth profit rather in the powers of vnderstanding, then in the vertues
of the will and affections: So that Caluin though hee had
beene younger when he came to Geneua, then you make him;
yet had his youth bin no sufficient cause toSee no man despise thy youth. Tit. despise him, considering,
as the Lawyers for the punishing of a malefactor vnder

which shewes it selfe in this, that before his comming thither,
he had written his excellent Commentarie vpon Seneca de
Clementia, and at Orleans had beene offered the degree of Doctorship
in the lawes, without paying so much as the ordinary
fees, by the generall consent of all the publike professours of
that facultie: whereas their common determination is now
sayd to bee, Accipiamus pecuniam, &amp; dimittamus asinum in patriam:
but to draw neerer to the purpose: Caluin, how rare and
singular soeuer his gifts were, euen beyond his age, yet withall
they were so tempered and seasoned with modestie, that
single he attempted nothing in the reforming of that Church,
as Mr. Doctour pretends; but by aduise, and with consent of
the chiefe Pastours, whom hee found there, Farell and Viret,
which three, a fourth Minister in the same citie hath thus happily
ioyned together.
                  
                     Gallica mirata est Caluinum Ecclesia, nuper

                  Nay he was so farre from excluding them, or putting himselfe
out of his ambition into the businesse (as Master Doctour
would haue it,) that by the former of them himselfe was in a
maner drawen into it: for passing through Geneua by chance,
and intending to trauell for his studies into farther parts, to
Basil, or Strasbourge, Farel requesting him long and earnestly
to set vp his rest there, and to ioyne his labours with them, for
the good of that Citie, when hee sawe hee could not preuaile,
being a man inspired with an Heroicall spirit, he suddenly
breakes out into this vehement speech, [At ego tibi sludia
tua praetexenti denuntio omnipotentis Dei nomine, futurum, vt nisi
in opus istud Domini nobiscum incumbas, tibi non tam Christum
quàm te ipsum querenti, Dominus maledicat.] But I (saith he) denounce
vnto you pretending your studies; in the Name of

God Almightie, that except you set your selfe with vs to this
worke of the Lord, it will come to passe, that seeking your
selfe and not Christ, hee will send a curse vpon your proceedings.]
With which dreadfull threat, Caluin being terrified,
submitted himselfe to the disposition of the Presbiterie and
Magistracie: whence we may also gather that Caluin was neither
the sole, nor first founder of that gouernement, but that
the seeds of it were sowen, and the foundation layed before
his comming thither. Now let the Reader iudge of the truth
of that which Mr. Doctour hath published, namely that Caluin
thought good vpon the opportunitie to giue the venture, and to
step in himselfe to be the founder of a new Church, and State among
them, and withall consider whether Mr. Dr. professing that
he had read Caluins life witten by Beza (frō whom I haue borrowed,
what touching this point I haue deliuered; hee fought
not against the light of his own conscience, when hee thus
wrote touching Caluin: Neither (to speak a truth) can I cōceiue
any likely reason why he should aspire to be sole or chiefe commander
in that Citie, which (as Beza truely witnesseth of it,)
is and hath beene Paupertatis officina, the shop of pouertie, in
so much that when hee dyed, his whole estate (together with
his studie of bookes sold at a deare rate, could hardly be valued
at 300. Crownes, verefying therein that notable speech of his
owne in the Preface of his Commentarie on the Psalmes: that
Me non esse pecuniosum, si quibusdam viuus non persuadeo, mors tamen ostendet. 
                     I am no money-monger (saith hee) if liuing I cannot perswade
men, my death will put it out of doubt.
                  
                  Lastly, for the better clearing of this point, and the discouering
of the trueth of his proceedings at his first comming to
Geneua, I will hereunto adde the relation of one, who professedly
wrote against the necessitie of imposing that discipline
on other Churches, which he there erected, and therefore may
well be thought not to speake partially on his behalfe, and yet
for his learning and singular iudgement to haue vnderstood
what he wrote better then Dr. Carier: His words are.M. Hooker in his Preface to his Ecclesiasticall discipline. [A founder

thither the forme of their ciuill regiment was popular, as it
continueth at this day: Neither King, nor Duke, nor Nobleman,
of any authoritie or power ouer them, but Officers
chosen by the people, yeerely out of themselues, to order
all things with publike consent: For Spirituall gouernement
they had no Lawes at all agreed vpon, but did what the
Pastours of their Soules by perswation could winne them
vnto. Caluin being admitted one of their preachers, and a Diuinitie
Reader amongst them, considered how dangerous it
was that the whole estate of that Church should still hang on
so slender a threed, as the liking of an ignorant multitude is, if
it haue power to change whatsoeuer it listeth: wherefore taking
vnto him two of the other Ministers for more countenance
of the action (albeit the rest were all against it) they
mooued and in the end perswaded with much adoe the people
to binde themselues by solemne oath, first, neuer to admit
the Papacie amongst them againe, and secondly, to liue
in obedience vnto such orders concerning the exercise of their
Religion, and the former Eccesiasticall gouernment, as those
their true and faithfull Ministers of Gods word had agreeably
to Scripture set down for that end and purpose.] Whence
wee may obserue, first, that Caluin was no founder of a new
State amongst them (as Mr. Doctor would beare vs in hand)
but as hee found it popular at his entrance, so at his death hee

left it: Secondly, the citizens swore not that all Popery was false,
as Mr. Doctor assures, but bound themselues with an oath,
neuer to admit of the Papacie (that is as I take the Popes vsurped
authoritie) amongst them againe, and for his Catechisme
one hee wrote which Beza calles opus admirandum, an admirable
peece of worke, so much desired of all nations, that himselfe
hauing first written it in Latine and French, it was afterward
at the request of strangers translated into High Dutch,
Low Duch, English, Spanish, and by Immanuel Tremelius into
Hebrew, and by Henry Stephens into Greeke: but that (as I
suppose) which you meane was the heads of Christian Religion
comprised in a few positions, not vnlike our Booke of Articles
which we are bound to subscribe vnto: wherein, for any
thing I can finde, hee speaketh none otherwise of Faith, then
the Scriptures giue him warrant, which, it may bee in your opinion
are but a strong fancie neither: but had you as throughly
read him vpon that point of Iustification by faith, as Pighius
did, though with a mind to confute him, you might haue had
the grace to haue yeelded in opinion to him, as hee did by the
confession of Tapper in the 8th. Article of his second Tome,
sometimes his fellow-pupil vnder Adrian, the VI. Pope of that
name, neither doth hee in that Catechisme teach them to contemne
all ancient learning and authoritie as you faine, but fained
authoritie and learning falsely so called: For what learning
haue wee more ancient then the Scriptures? or what authoritie
more binding; and yet for authoritie of the most auncient
Councels and godly Fathers, I thinke hee voucheth more
then euer Doctor Carrier read, though hee built not his
faith vpon them, and teach others to doe the like: in regard of
such auncient learning and authoritie, being but humane (the
aduise of the Prophet is to bee regarded, or rather the command
of God by the Prophets mouth to bee obeyed,Ierem. 6. 16.

a stand, and to discouer and take a viewe, but it is no warrant
to guide or to conduct them, a iust ground, I say, it is of deliberation,
but not of direction: but on the other side (as it is
well obserued by a writer whom Master Doctor himselfe before
nameth with honour) who knoweth not that time is truely
compared to a streame, that carrieth downe fresh and pure waters
into the salt sea of corruption, which enuironeth all humane actions;
and therefore if man shall not by his industry, vertue, and policie, as
it were with the Oare, rowe against the streame and inclination of
time, all institutions and ordinances (be they neuer so pure) will corrupt
and degenerate.
                  
                  Finally, for the iustifying of that which you haue deliuered
touching Caluine and his proceedings, you send vs to Bezaes
narratiō of Caluins life, but had you not in the perusal therof
shut vp the eye of charitie, and onely opened that of malice
and enuie, you might as easily haue seene and obserued in the
same narration, his wonderfull assiduitie in reading, in preaching,
in writing, in conferring; insomuch that being aduised
by his physicians, and by his friends requested a little to forbeare,
in regard of the weakenesse of his body, and his manifold
infirmities, his vsuall answere was, that [idlenesse to him
was the greatest sickenesse, or Vultis me otiosum à Domino deprehendi,
will yee that the Lord when hee commeth should
finde me doing nothing?] his zeale to Gods trueth, and courage
in maintaining it, such, that he not only crushed the errors
of the Church of Rome, but quelled like another Hercules so
many new monsters of opinions by the clubbe of Gods word,
that the very mētioning the names of the authors, and summ

of their seuerall heresies, would take vp much time and many
lines: his sound and profound knowledge in his profession
such, that Melancthon, no childe in Diuinitie, was wont to
style him by an excellencie The Diuine: his temperance such,
that for many yeres he tooke but one repast a day: his modesty
such that by his will hee ordained after his death, there should
be no monumēt erected to him, or so much as a Tombe-stone
layed ouer him; yet Beza his Colleague would not spare to
bestowe this ensuing Epitaph on him, which hee was as

able, as (vpon that sad occasion) vnwilling to afford, and the
other (out of his deserts) as worthy, as (out of his modesty the
crowne of all his other vertues) vnwilling to receiue.

                  After his death many of the citizens who had often seene
him before, yet much desired to see him againe, and many
strangers came from forreine parts purposely to know him,

Rochell, the inhabitants being brought to great want, (as Thuanus
reports it) euery tide were brought in a kinde of shel-fish,

little scallops or muscles, and that in great abundance, for the
relieuing of the besieged; they hauing neuer bene seene vpon
that coast before that time, nor since. Of Ziska the Bohemian,

be indued with singular vertue and wisedome, and shee haue
about her Counsellours of excellent iudgement and foresight
in the managing of her affaires, yet must wee confesse that humane
Counsels are often frustrated, vnlesse they bee guided
from heauen; and that I should so thinke, the remembrance of
the passages of latter times inforceth me, when I call to minde
how many home-bred and forraine enemies haue layed in
waite for the life of that vertuous Queene; and how miraculously
God hath freed her from all their plots and assaults.]
                  You goe forward, and tell vs that from hence it is come to
passe, that the lawfull doctrine of the Church of England is contemned
as a ragge of Popery, and Caluins Institutions cried vp by voyces
in Court and Countrey, in hope it may one day serue the like
turne in England, as it hath done in Geneua, as if Geneua had not
discharged her selfe of the claime of her Bishop and Duke, before
Caluin compiled his Institutions, or as if we knew not that
Caluins Institutions make nothing against the gouernment of
lawfull Magistrates; or if it bee a booke so dangerous as you
would make it, a wonder it is to mee, that neither your selfe
nor any as yet of that side, haue so much as vndertaken a
through confutation of it. Must it needes be that all who imbrace
his paines and learning in those Institutions, intend the

subuersion of the state, or presently contemne the doctrine of the
Church of England? Your olde Master, Archbishop Whitegift
was of another minde, who maintained to his vtmost the doctrine
of the Church of England, and yet gaue he Caluin his due
also, labouring alwayes where any occasion was offered, to
countenance his writings with Caluins authority, and specially
out of that booke which you most mislike, yeelding him the
title of a famous and learned man: Nay, euen in the vse of
things indifferent, hee giues this testimonie of his iudgement
and moderation. [Tract. 2 cap. 4. If Mr. Caluin were aliue, saith he, and rightly
vnderstood the state of our Church and Controuersie, truly
I verely beleeue that hee would condemne your doing, and I
am the rather induced to thinke so, because I vnderstand him
to haue allowed many things in the English Church, being at
Geneua, which you altogether mislike.] To this Archbishops
testimonie, I could adde the opinion of his predecessours,
Cranmer Grindal, and Parker, gathered out of their seuerall
Epistles to Caluin and other writings; but I will content my
selfe with that of Bishop Iewell, who was so far frō neglecting
or contemning the doctrine of the Church of England, as a relique
or ragge of Poperie, as that the Confession extant in his Apologie
for our Church, is registred as the authenticall doctrine of
our Church, as well in the body, as in the harmony of Confessions:
But ArchbishopTract. 8. cap. 3. diuis. 31. 
                     Whitegift goeth farther, making
both his Apology &amp; the defence therof, to be the doctrine of the
Church of England: And by this Archbishops authority was it
ordered, that those his bookes should be bought of euery Parish,
and chained in their Churches to be read of the people at
vacant times: Yet this worthy Bishop in the defence of his
Apologie,Cap. 7 diuis. 4. termeth Caluin a reuerend Father, and worthy ornament
of the Church of God. Now touching his booke of Christian
Institution in particular, M. Hooker (who is well knowne
not to haue contemned the doctrine of the Church of England, as a
ragge of Poperie) thus writes. [Two things (saith he speaking
of Caluin, in his Preface to his bookes of Ecclesiasticall policie)
of principall moment there are, which haue deseruedly procured
him honour through the world: The one his exceeding

paines in composing the Institutions of Christian religion: The
other his no lesse industrious traua

                     les for exposition of holy
Scripture, according to the same Institutions: In which two
things whatsoeuer they were that afterward bestowed their
labour, he gained the aduantage of preiudice against them, if
they gaine-sayed, and of glory aboue them, if they consented:
Then which I cannot imagine what could bee vttered more
effectually. Thus malice would not suffer you to see that
worth in Caluin and his Writings, which these Worthies professed
and published, who were notwithstanding more earnest
and zealous Patrones of the doctrine of the Church of England,
then your selfe: But it may be you thought it would bee credit
enough for you onely to enter the lists with so stout and renowned
a champion: howbeit, to hunt after applause by
dishonouring the names of famous men, was held by S. Ierome,
and is accounted by all good and wise men, but a tricke
of vaine and childish arrogancie, there being lesse comparison

shew: Caluin is so well knowen (sayeth hee) to all those
that bee learned or wise, for his great paines and good labours
in the Church of God, that a fewe snarling Friars cannot impeach
his name, though you would neuer so wretchedly peruert
his words.] Thus much of Caluin and his Writings, for I

                  Whether reason, or rather corruption of State haue not bred
confusion, rather in the doctrine of the Church of Rome, then of

England, let Romes infinite ambition and insatiable couetousnesse,
masked vnder pretence of doctrine testifie. As long as the
Bishops of Rome kept them to their profession in the gaining
of soules to God, matters went wel for doctrine: but when once
they turned Statists, &amp; in stead of gaining soules, cast about for
the gouernment of the world, then were their Friars and flatterers
found, who were as readie to shape and frame her Doctrine
according to the modell of State. Before the Councill
of Trent (which was called in the memorie of some yet liuing)
it is made euident by my learned brother Dr. Carleton in his
Consent of the Catholike Church against the Tridentines, that
the Doctrine of the rule of Controuersies of the Church, of
Iustifying Faith, of Grace, was the same in the Church of Rome,
which is now publikely taught and professed with vs. If by
the Church of Rome, we will vnderstand her chiefe Prelates, not
those Friars and flatterers which belonged rather to her Court
then her Church; from whence then arose this confusion of doctrine
which followed after, but onely from that corruption of
State which went before? and yet it cannot but bee acknowledged,
that as our bodies first warme our clothes, and then
our clothes serue to keepe warme our bodies: so the corruption
of State first brought foorth this confusion of doctrine; but being
brought foorth, the daughter serues to nourish and maintaine
the mother. Now for the confounding of our doctrine, wee answere
with S. Paul, [1. Cor. 4. 3. 
                     If our Gospel (saith he) be hid, it is hid to
them that are lost;] So we if our doctrine bee confounded, it is to
them,Verse 4. whom the God of this world hath confounded and blinded,
lest the light of the glorious Gospel of CHRIST, who is
the image of God, should shine vnto them.
                  The second thing which you charge vs with, is the slandering
the doctrine of the Church of Rome: and are your Romanists
cleare of that accusation, or dare any man of iudgement and
learning discharge them? doth notIn Cap. 9. ad Rom. disp. 5.

Booke was in his name written, in defence of the seuen Sacraments,
against Luther, (as Mr. Doctor might haue learned, if
no where else, yet out of Cardinall Bellarmins Apologie.) But
in defence of the See of Rome (which hee cals Apostolike,) I haue
not mette with any; and it should seeme by his mistake of the
subiect, handled in that booke, himselfe neuer mette with it:
as for the Title which King Henry receiued, the world is not ignorant,
how liberall his Holinesse is in bestowing Titles, where
hee expects some greater aduantage, sticking down a feather
that hee may quietly carrie away the goose.Thus did hee intitle Philip the 2. King of Spain

giue Charles the Emperour, neere about the same time, the Title
of Defensor Ecclesiae, for directing a Writ of Outlawrie against
Luther, whereupon at the Emperours beeing here in
England, those verses were set vp in the Guildhall in London, ouer
the doore of their Councell Chamber, where they yet
remaine.

And in the Bull, by which Leo the tenth confirmed this Title
to the King, subscribed with his owne name, and the names of
fiue and twentie Cardinals and Bishops, it appeares that their
chiefe scope of honouring him with this Title was, to tye him
and his posteritie faster to that See: But as a learned and graue

you would with Bellarmine tell vs, that his Maiestie in present,
as vndeseruedly retaines that Title, as King Henry receiued
it deseruedly, who afterward notwithstanding as deepely
incurred his Holinesse disfauour, aswell by calling into question
that Title which the Bishops of Rome had assumed to themselues,
of Pastours vniuersall, S. Peters successours, and Christs
Vicars: as by resuming to himselfe that Title which some of
the Popes had yeelded his predecessours, as may appeare in the
Letter of Eleutherius Bishop of Rome, to Lucius King of Great
Britaine, in which Eleutherius attributeth to the King the Title
of Gods Vicar within his kingdome: which letter, howsoeuer

                  Neither is it true, that Henry tooke this Title to himselfe: it was
giuen him by the Parliament of his Lords, and Commons, and
Conuocation of his Clergie, not as a new thing but as renewed.
And if he were desirous to change his bedfellow in hope of heires
male, as you tell vs before, it was not to giue way to the lust of
Anne Bulleine, as here you affirme; and if hee might haue had
his will in being dispensed with by yeelding to the Popes will,
in ioyning with Francis the French King, against the Emperour
Charles as before it is proued, then did he not exclude the
Pope, &amp; take that Title to dispence with himselfe, especially being
mooued with the approbation of so many Vniuersities and
learned men: But if thereby he made himselfe a way for the
supply of his excesse with the spoyle of the Church, wee haue not
wherein so iustly to excuse him, howbeit hee conuerted much
of it to good vses, namely to the erecting of sixe Bishoprickes,
to wit, Westminster, Chester, Peterborough, Oxford, Bristol and
Gloucester, whereof the fiue last are yet in being; at which time

hee also erected at Canterbury a Deane with 12. Prebends, at
Winchester another with 12. more, at Worcester another with
ten, at Chester another with sixe, at Peterborough another with
sixe, at Oxford another with eight, at Ely another with eight,
at Gloucester another with sixe, at Bristol another with sixe, at
Carlile another with foure, at Durham another with twelue,
at Rochester another with sixe, and lastly, at Norwich another
with sixe;Besides all this hee bestowed the reuenues of the Gray Friars in London vpon the Citie of London, toward the reliefe of their poore, making of the Friery a Parish Church, whereunto hee gaue 500. marks yeerely of lands for euer: one thousand marks also he commanded to be giuen to the poore, and to twelue poore Knights at Windsore, each of them twelue pence a day for euer. so that wee haue good reason to thinke he returned
againe to the Church much out of the Abbey lands: and if,
notwithstanding all this, God blessed him not in his thriuing, wee
haue nothing else to answere but that of Salomon, [It is a snare
to the man who deuoureth that which is holy, and after vowes to
make inquiry]
                  
                  But in his wiuing hee so blessed him, (though in this too hee
shewed himselfe a man, and consequently subiect to humane
passion, and frailty) that three of his children successiuely wore
the Crown after him, of which the first was renowmed for his
vertue beyond his age, and the last beyond her Sexe; of the
one, and his mother it was written,

                        Phoenix Ianaiacet, nato Phoenice; dolendum
                        Saecula Phoenices nullatulisse duas.
                     
And to the other might bee applied,

                        Non decor effecit fragilem, non sceptra superbam,
                        Sola potens humilis, sola pudica decens.
                     
And though they all died without issue, yet doth his honour
still liue in theirs. Henry the II. of France died in the vnitie of
the Church of Rome; yet three of his sonnes reigning after him
left the Crown to a neighbour Prince, as the children of Henry
the VIII heere with vs did, yet none that I haue met with
hold him in that regard accursed of God, and if in that respect
God cursed Henry, because hee renounced the pretended authoritie
of the Church of Rome, then should hee by vertue
of that reason haue blessed Henries eldest daughter with issue,
who with great submission and deuotion reconciled her selfe
to that Church, and married to the most Catholike King; and
though the world were for a while so borne in hand; yet in the

end the great and solemne expectation thereof vanished into
smoake.
                  Now that Henrie was wearie of his title of Supremacie before
he died, it appeares not, and that hee wished to bee reconciled to
the Pope, which you call, being in the Church againe, is as vnlikely,
since no doubt is to bee made, but vpon notice giuen of
his Contrition, and desire of Satisfaction, hee might as easily
haue beene absolued as wished it: But certaine it is, that hee
wished it not, if we may make coniecture of his wishes from
those speeches, which a little before his death hee deliuered to
Mounsieur de Hannibault, Lord Admirall of France, and Ambassadour
to the French king, being then at Hampton Court in
the moneth of August, and in the yeere 1546. in the hearing
of Cranmer Lord Archbishop of Canterburie, concerning
the reformation of Religion, and afterwards more neere
his death, and more openly to Bruno Ambassador of Iohn Frederike
Duke of Saxonie, vnto whom the King gaue this answere,
in the hearing of these foure sufficient witnesses, the
Lord Seymer, Earle of Hartford, Lord Lisley, then Admirall,
the Earle of Bedford, Lord Priuie Seale, and the Lord Paget,
[That if the quarrell of the Duke of Saxonie
were nothing else against the Emperour, but
for matter of Religion, he should stand to it
strongly, and hee would take his part, willing
him not to doubt nor feare,] and with this
answere dismissed him. Besides the manner of his sonne and
heire Apparent, Prince Edwards education, the qualitie and
disposition of those persons whom he named as the principall
ouerseers of his Will, (from which number hee excluded the
Bishop of Winchester, the most busie and forward instrument
in those times, for the maintenance of the Romish Religion,
though hee had once admitted him, and was earnestly solicited
by some of his bed chamber to readmit him) are to mee so
many euident demonstrations, that hee was so farre from wishiug
reconciliation with the Church of Rome, that hee rather

desired and intended, if God had spared him life a while longer,
some more full and perfect reformation of Religon: But
the secret working of Gods holy prouidence which disposeth
all things after his owne wisedome and purpose, thought it
good, rather by taking that King away, to reserue the accomplishment
of that worke (as he did the building of his Temple
to Solomon,) to the peaceable time of his sonne Edward, and
Elizabeth his daughter, whose hands were vndefiled with any
blood, and life vnspotted with any violence or crueltie.
                  Lastly, not content to rippe vp the disgraces of his life, you
dogge him to his very graue, bearing vs in hand, that he was accursed
of God, in as much as hee wanted a Tombe; which was the
want also of Queene Mary his daughter: But if the want of a
Tombe be a token of Gods Curse vpon Henry, then the hauing
of it must consequently be a token of his blessing vpon Elizabeth,
whom notwithstanding you wrappe in the same Curse:
Nay how many of your Bishops of Rome then are Cursed of
God, of whom a number are not onely without Tombes; but
some in the first age of the Church, by the fury of their persecutors,
and some in latter times, by the malice of their Successors
without Graues also? Indeed wee reade of Dauid, a man
after Gods owne heart:

Poet could tell vs,

spirits may be of Catoes minde, desirous rather that after their
deaths, it should be demaunded [why they haue no statue erected
to their memory, then why they haue one.] This I speake
onely to shew that had hee had no Tombe, yet were it no
great dishonor to him: But if we may credite the last, but not

the worst compiler of the Historie of our Countrey, hee was
with great solemnitie buried at Windsor, vnder a most costly
and stately Tombe, begun in copper and guilt, but neuer finished;
In the inclosures of whose grates is curiously cast this
Inscription. Henricus Octauus, Rex Angliae, Franciae,
Dominus Hiberniae, Fidei defensor. And that it
might appeare to posteritie how Artificiall and Magnificent
this worke was intended, he there sets downe the seuerall parcels
and pieces of the Modell thereof, as he found it described
in a Manuscript, receiued from Mr. Lancaster, one of the Heralds
at Armes, the title whereof was this.
                  The maner of the Tombe to be made for
the Kings Grace at Windsor.
                  So that I cannot but woonder, how either our Historiographer
and our Herauld should be so much mistaken, or (which
I rather thinke) how Mr. Doctor, so great a Polititian, should
be so sowly deceiued, and so confidently leade others into the
same errour.
                  I will conclude this Section, with the conclusion of ourfamous
Annalist, touching this Prince, [Princeps Magnanimus, in
cuius maximo ingenio inerant, confuso quodam temperamento, virtutes
magnae, &amp; vitia non minora. A stout and gallant Prince he
was, in whose braue spirit a man might obserue, blended and
tempered together, by a rare kinde of mixture, great vertues,
and no lessevices.] But had he honoured the See Apostolike,
as much at last, as hee did at first, his vices had beene buried in
silence, and his vertues highly extolled: whereas now by opposing
himselfe against it, his vertues are suppressed, and his
vices racked vpon tenterhookes, and set vpon the Stage: which
course were enough to make the best Princes, nay the best
men to appeare monsters to the world.

                  Queene ELIZABETH, although she were the daughter of
Schisme, yet at her first comming to the Crowne, shee would haue
the Common Prayer Booke and Catechisme so set downe, that shee
might both by English Seruice satisfie the Commons, who were
greedie of alteration, and by Catholike opinions, gaue hope to her
neighbour Princes, that she would her selfe continue Catholike; and
all her life long she caried herselfe so betwixt the Catholikes and the
Caluinists, as shee kept them both still in hope: But yet being the
daughter of the breach-maker, and hauing both her Crowne and
her life from the Schisme, it was both dishonourable and dangerous
for her to hearken to Reconcilement: And therefore after she
was prouoked by theOut of this Bull, as out of the Tro
                              •
                           an horse, issued so many Conspiracies as followed after. Excommunication of Pius Quintus, shee
did suffer such Lawes to be made by her Parliaments, as might cry
quittance with the Pope and Church of Rome: This course seemed
in policie necessary for her, who was the daughter of King Henrie
the VIII. by Anne Bulleine, borne with the contempt of Rome,
the disgrace of Spaine, and the preiudice of Scotland.

                  32.
                  From Henry the father you descend to Elizabeth, the daughter
(as you call her) of Schisme: howbeit she were indeed the
Nursing mother of the Church. And for the Common prayer
Booke which she allowed, it was the same, with very litle alteration,
which was current by publike authority, during the reigne
of her brother King Edward: So that it was no inuention of hers
to satisfie the Commons, as you falfly suggest, but an imitation of
her renowned brother for the satisfying of her owne conscience,
and the furtherance of the seruice of God in a knowen
language. You adde that by Catholike opinions she gaue hope to
her neighbour Princes, that she would continue a Catholike: wheras
the world knowes that her mother was otherwise affected,
being brought vp in France, vnder the Lady Margret Alençon,
                     
a principal fauouresse of the Protestant religion there, after
shee had a while waited vpon Q. Mary, yonger sister of king
Henry the VIII. and wife to Lewes the XIII. the French king,
and as long vpon Claudia, sister to the Guise, and wife to Francis
the first; and in regard she was this way affected, the holy
maide of Kent, was by Clergie men suborned to prophecie against
her,Mich, Sands. and (as one writes) it seemeth very plaine, that the
crimes supposed against her, were matters contriued by the
Pope, and his instruments her chiefest enemies, none of them
all that were accused in the same treason confessing the acte euen
vnto death, but haue left direct testimonies in writing to
the contrary, (one meane groome excepted, namely Marke
Smeton, who made confession vpon some promise of life belike,
but was executed before he was aware, or had time to recall
what he had said,) Now the mother being thus affected, and
that before king Henry cast his affection towards her, or disaffected
Rome, in likelyhood the daughter had beene that way
also affected, whether the breach with Rome by her mothers
mariage had bene made or no. It was S. Pauls argument to
Timothie, [
                        
                           •
                        . Tim. 1. 5. 
                     that the faith first dwelt in his grandmother Lois,
and his mother Eunice, and therefore he was well perswaded of him
also.] He argues not from his father and his grandfather, but
from his mother, and his grandmother; so may we by the same
reason, from the faith, which dwelt in the mother of Queene
Elizabeth, make some coniecture of her faith, that it was not
different from her mothers: But her education vnder Roger
Ascham, (who was himselfe that way affected, &amp; to cōtinue her
so, read vnto her among other authors for her diuinity exercise,
Melancthons common places) will yet farther cleare this matter:
but the suspition cast vpon her, (though most vniustly) as hauing
a finger in Wyats conspiracy, and Stories damnable aduise
[to leaue lopping at the branches, and strike at the roote,] will put
it out of doubt; and doubtlesse as in that regard shee suffered
much hardenesse, during the raigne of her sister, so had shee
not suruiued to haue worne the Crowne, had not God in his
prouidence mooued the heart of the Spaniard to preserue her
aliue, not so much out of any loue of her person, or pittie of her

ruefull estate, as out of reason of state, lest she being taken out
of the way, and her sister dying (as she did) without issue, the
Kingdomes of England, Scotland, and Ireland, might in time
be vnited and annexed to the Crowne of France, by meanes
of the Lady Mary, Queene of Scotland (next heire in right after
Queene Elizabeth) then affianced to Francis Dolphin of
France, and heire apparent to Henry the second, the French
King; then which the Spaniards thought nothing could happen
more disasterous to their affectation of greatnesse.
                  Besides all this, being as she was the miracle of her sexe and
ranke, for wit and learning, it is not improbable that, as the
knowledge of the Arts and Languages, and the light of the
Gospell brake forth both together; so in her person the one
might haue prepared, and as it were beaten out a way for the
entrance of the other, though neither her Mother had beene
that way affected, nor her Father made any breach, as wee see
his Maiestie that now is, to the glory of God and our great
comfort, though his Father were slaine before his birth, and
his Mother liued and died in that Religion, in which shee was
brought vp, yet by the excellencie of his naturall parts and
learning (but especially by the working of Gods holy spirit)
hath attained to such a light of Religion, that he hath not only
discouered the trueth, but chosen and professed it being discouered,
and with his Penne maintained and defended that
which he professeth. True indeede it is, that Queene Elizabeth,
during the raigne of her sister, tender both by sexe and
age, and wrought by the frownes and threates of Cardinall
Poole, then Archbishop of Canterbury, the Popes Legate, and
in England the principall Proctor and Champion, for the aduancing
of his authority, was once brought to acknowledge
that shee was a Romane Catholike, but herein she did no more
then St. Peter did (whose successour the Bishop of Rome pretendeth
himselfe) in denying his Master: No more then the
Prince of Condie, the King of Nauarre and his sister, who at the
massacre of Paris, for feare renounced their Religion, and were
by the Cardinall of Bourbon reconciled to the Church of Rome;
though after ward being at liberty they reimbraced their former

profession: Nay, no more then Queene Mary her selfe,
who being terrified with her Fathers displeasure, wrote him a
Letter vvith her owne hand (yet to be seene) in which for euer
she renounceth the Bishop of Romes authority in England, and
acknowledging her Father vnder Christ supreame head of the
Church of England, confesseth his marriage with her Mother
to haue beene vnlawfull and incestuous.
                  But I would faine know, after Queene Elizabeth came to
the wearing of the Crowne, by what Catholike opinions shee
gaue hope to her neighbour Princes that shee would continue Catholike?
If it were so, (as Mr. Doctor would beare vs in hand)
how was it that the reformed Churches through Christendome
applauded her comming to the Crowne, as it had beene
the appearance of some luckie starre, or the rising of some
glorious Sunne for their Comfort and reliefe, and your pretended
Catholikes hung downe their heads as if they had seene
some Come

that at that time shee then maintained the same opinions

may be worth the remembring, that the fourteenth day of Ianuary,

Oglethorpe Bishop of Carlile: by these proceedings I say it is
plaine, that at her first entrance to the Crowne, she sufficiently
declared her selfe to bee the same in matter of Religion, as afterwards
they found her.
                  Wherunto, if full satisfaction be not yet giuen in this point,
for farther proofe might be added, that when Philip of Spaine
wooed her for mariage (the funerals of her sister being not yet

solemnized) The French King by his Agent the Bishop of
Engolesme laboured (if it had gone forward) to stop their dispensation
at Rome, vnder colour that Queene Elizabeth fauoured
the Protestants Religion, and the Earle of Feria, the
Spaniards Agent here in England, bore our pretended Catholiks
in hand, that except that match went forward, it could not
goe well with them; so farre was shee at her first entrance from
giuing hope to her neighbours (as Mr. Doctor would perswade
the world) of continuing or turning Catholike, by shew of Catholike
opinions, vnlesse her retaining the ancient forme of Ecclesiasticall
policie, and the godly Ceremonies vsed in the Primitiue
Church be accounted Catholike opinions, as in truth, if
wee take the word Catholike aright, they may: But no maruell
hee should thus boldly and falsely charge the dead, since
hee spareth not in the same kinde his Maiestie now reigning,
and by Gods grace long to reigne amongst vs, to the confutation
of such slanders and confusion of such slanderers.
                  Hee goes on and tels vs, that all her life long shee caried
her selfe so betwixt Catholikes and Caluinists, as shee kept them
both still in hope: But herein he mainely crosseth himselfe, aswell
in that which hee hath deliuered in the Section next saue
one going before, that [if there bee now the same reason of State,
as there was all Queene Elizabeths dayes, there is as little hope
that his Maiestie should hearken vnto reconciliation, as then there
was that Q. Elizabeth would:] as also in that which afterwards
he addes in this Section, that [being prouoked by the excommunication
of Pius Quintus, shee did suffer such lawes to bee made by
her Parliament, as might crie quittance with the Pope and Church
of Rome.] And in the next Section he sayth, [It was necessary, in
reason of State, to continue the doctrine of diuision, as long as the
fruit of that doctrine did continue.] Thus his owne testimonies,
like the false witnesses which deposed against our Sauiour, agree
not together, but is it likely that shee caried her selfe all
her life long with such indifferencie; considering shee sent
helpe, both by men and money, to the Protestants in Germanie,
in Scotland, in France, in the Netherlands; Shee harboured
and succoured such Italians, French, and Dutch, as forsaking

their owne Countreys for conscience sake, fled for refuge
into her Dominions, as to a common Sanctuary of piety
and Religion, affording them conuenient places for the exercise
of their deuotions, in the Isles of Iersey and Garnsey, in
Hampton, in Norwich, in Sandwich, in Maidston, in Canterbury,
in Colchester, and in London it selfe: Moreouer, shee that
would not so much as admit Pius Quartus his Nuntio in the
yeere 1561. to enter her Kingdome, though hee brought with
him very friendly Letters from the Pope: Shee that would
not bee intreated by the Emperour, and other Princes sollicitations

aswell into France as into the Netherlands, bestowing on
him the noble Order of the Garter, which with her own hands
shee put on, together with many rich presents, and an yeerely
pension during his life bestowed on him: Shee that was voyced

and Taxes, because of her exactions vpon Recusants, and rigorous

Lawes (as they pretended) against Seminary Priests &amp;

dishartened by the threats and thundering Bull of Pius Quintus,
is it possible (I say) that she, who (notwithstanding all the
difficulties &amp; dangers that might from then cearise,) was from

                         Crowne and her life from the Schisme, it was both dishonorable
and dangerous for her to hearken to Reconcilement:] whereas
in trueth she had her life, and held her Crowne from the Author
of life and grand Commander of Crownes, to which shee had
farre better right then hee, that would haue deposed her, to
his triple Crowne, the one being helde of her by lawfull succession,
(which had beene so acknowledged by the Bishop of
Rome himselfe, would shee haue submitted herselfe to the
power of that See,) but the other of him by vnlawfull vsurpation.
And if in regarde shee was the daughter of the Breachmaker,
it was both dishonourable and dangerous for her to hearken
to Reconcilement, it must consequently follow, that likewise
dangerous and dishonourable it would haue beene to keepe the
Pontifician partie in hope: and though she were iustly prouoked
by the biting Excommunication of Pius Quintus, being
stricken by him before she was Legally cited or warned, in so
much as some of the Romish Catholikes themselues, thought
it a peece of rashnesse in that Pope so to deale with her, yet
before this Bull was extant, shee gaue so little hope to those
whom you call Catholikes, that the Pope therein labours to
paint her foorth as a barbarous and bloody Persecutour: and wee
may well imagine, that had shee giuen such hope as you pretend

she did to the Romanists, the world had neuer heard the
bellowing of that Bull: But thankes be vnto GodMath. 7. 25. 1. Cor. 10. 4.

fell, the floods came, the windes blewe, and beat sore vpon her
house; but it fell not: for it was founded vpon a Rocke, and that
Rocke was CHRIST. During her happie and glorious
raigne somewhat aboue the space of 44. yeeres, shee saw the
change of no lesse then 8. Popes, Paulus the 4th. sitting in that
See at her entrance, and Clement the eight at her death, betweene
which two came these seuen, Pius 4. Pius 5. Cregorie
13. Sextus 5. Vrban. 7. Gregorie 14. and Innocent the 9th. all
which wrought more or lesse both against her Person and
State; so that she might deseruedly take vp that of the Psalmist:
[Psal. 22. 12. 13. 
                     Many Bulles haue compassed me, strong Bulles of Bashan
haue beset me round, they gaped vpon mee with their mouthes, as a
rauening and roaring Lyon]: But being by his Gracious prouidence,
(who set the Crowne vpon her head,) deliuered from
all their snares, shee might well stampe that of the same Psalmist
vpon her coyne as shee did, and with all no doubt vpon
her heart: Posui Deum adiutorem meum, and sing with Deborah
after her victory vpon Sisera.

Now that which sharpened her against Pius Quintus, was not
onely his Bull (though that were in it selfe cause sufficient to
inrage her) but the setting aworke of one Ridolphus a Florentine,
who vnder the colour of Marchandizing, became the
Popes agent for blowing the coales, and stirring vp the minds,
aswell of her owne Subiects, as of forraine Princes against her,
by whom the olde Foxe promised if need were to goe in person
himselfe against her, and to lay to pawne if occasion so required
all the goods of the See Apostolike, euen to the Chalices,
the Crosiers, the Reliques and the Holy Vestments: Besides
all this he conferred an yeerely pension, and titles of honour

to prouoke her, we find recorded by Hieronimus Catena,
                     
in the life of Pius Quintus, who was Secretarie to Cardinall
Alexandrin that Popes Nephew, so that though he haue in that
discourse discouered many things to the world, of Pius his
proceedings against that Queene, before vnknowen to our
English, yet may wee well by reason of his place afforde him
credite, as also in regarde his booke was Printed and published
in Rome it selfe, with the Priuiledge and approbation of Sixtus
Quintus, next Successor to Pius saue one.
                  And had she not good reason then to suffer such Lawes to
bee made by her Parliament, as might crie quittance with the Pope
and Church of Rome? Yet I will bee bold to say that lesse innocent
blood, nay, lesse blood was shed in her 44. yeeres in maintenance
of Christs and her owne authoritie, against the vsurpation
of the Pope, then in her sisters foure yeeres in maintenance
of the Popes vsurpation against her owne and her Successours
lawfull authority, insomuch as an Italian, and hee no Protestant
(as I guesse) giues this testimonie of her, [Bizar. hist. Gen

                     Tanta extitit
eius animi moderatio, atque innata clementia, vt non immerito, &amp;c.
So great and so apparant was the moderation of her minde, and inbred
clemēcie, that not vndeseruedly it may be said of her, which the
ancient histories haue left to posteritie of Alexander Seuerus, borne
of his mother Mammaea, (Nempe Anaematon) hoc est citra sanguinem:
namely, that shee hath gouerned her kingdome without
bloodshed, Cum suapte natura, semper à caedibus &amp; crudelitate abhorreat,
for euen her nature doth abhorre the thought of slaughter
or crueltie.] &amp; so he goeth on in a large discourse of her praise:
And when he thus wrote, she had reigned twenty yeres, it being
a maruell (as the late Bishop of Lincolne in his answere to
Parsons hath well obserued) their Index expurgatorius had not
scowred him ere this, and for this; nay, their owne Priests shall
speake for Queene Elizabeths Lawes, whoQuodlibet. pag. 269. 277. say that [considering
Iesuiticall practises shadowed vnder the cloake of Religion,
all the Lawes enacted against Catholikes, were made with
great moderation and clemencie, as comming from a Prince
most milde and mercifull: nor haue they cause to vrge repeale
of any Statute made, so long as Iesuits take such courses.]
Nay, which is more, Parsons himselfe in the Preface to the

first part of his triple conuersion commendeth Queene Elizabeth
for her moderate gouernment, and that was in the last yeere
of her reigne: and yet by the way it is worth the noting, that
in one and the same leafe, hauing so commended her, in one
page (mary then she was aliue) in the very next page, (for then
he heard shee was dead) in a Preface to his Maiestie, he compares
her to Dioclesian for crueltie, whereas her sobrietie and
clemencie was such, that her brother King Edward was wont
commonly to call her, His sweete sister Temperance; neither did
shee euer heare of any capitall punishment (though neuer so
deserued) vpon offenders, euen of such as had sought her own
death, but it bred a kind of horror and sadnesse in her, whereby
had not her Counsellers earnestly inculcated the necessitie of
some exemplary iustice, many dangerous attempters had escaped
due punishment; which mooued her to say, being
once questioning with a greatD.R. of C.C.C. Diuine in Oxford, about books
meetest for Princes to studie on, that her reading of Senecade
Clementia, had done her much good; but some would perswade
her it had done her State as much harme: howsoeuer I will
shut vp this point with S.Epist. 48. 
                     Augustine, (when he was intreated
to mediate for a mittigation of some strait Lawes) if Princes
serue Christ in making Lawes for Christ, they doe what they
ought, I will not gaine say them; and your selfe graunt, that
this course seemed in poli
                           •
                        ie necessary for her, who was the daughter
of King Henry the VIII. by Anne Bulleine, borne with the
contempt of Rome, the disgrace of Spaine, and the preiudice of
Scotland: and it is true indeede that it both seemed, and was
a necessary course for her, not onely in policie, but in pietie, who
was the daughter of him, who vpon iust reason vnhorsed the
Pope of his pretended authoritie, by her who was not onely a
zealous professour, but a Patronesse of that trueth which wee
professe: and for her birth with the contempt of Rome, and disgrace
of Spaine, it seemed by her courses shee was not vnwilling
to haue it so int
                        •
                     rpreted: but for the preiudice of Scotland,
shee was vpon all occasions (so farre as shee conceiued
it stood with her safetie and honour) most willing to expresse
the contrary: and surely by her liuing and dying in a single

State without marriage, she rather prepared a way to the furtherance
of that Title, which wee now see to our great comfort,
as she would also no doubt to hers. (Si quis modo sensus
in vmbris, if there were any feeling or knowledge in the dead
of these temporall and transitory affaires) seeing it is fallen out
to bee as true in that succession, as it is in its owne nature
strange,

                  But now that your Maiestie is by the consent of all sides come to
the Crowne, and your vndoubted Title setled with long succession,
the case is very much altered: for your Maiestie hath no need of
dispensations, nor will to pull downe Churches, nor no dependance at
all on Henry the VIII: and if this Schisme could haue preuented
your Title with the diuorce of one wife, and the marrying of fiue
more, neither your mother, nor your selfe should euer haue made
Queene Elizabeth afraid with your Right to the Crowne of England;
and therefore though it were necessary, in reason of State,
to continue theThat which you call the doctrine of diuision was taught long before the diuision you speake of, was made, as hath beene already shewed, and his Maiestie; in regard of his father and grandfather, may aswell be called the fruit of Schisme as Queene Elizabeth
                      doctrine of diuision, as long as the fruit of that doctrine
did continue, yet now the fruit of Schisme is all spent, and
that Parenthesis of State is at an end, there is no reason but that the
old sentence may returne againe, and bee continued in that sense,
as if the Parenthesis had been cleane left out, and that God had of
purpose crossed the fleshly pretence of Schisme, and raised your Maiestie
to restore it as your most wise and Catholike progenitor King
Henrie the VII. did leaue it.

                  If his Maiestie, by the consent of all sides bee come to the
Crowne, why did Clement the VIII. the yeere before his entrance,

and that as his Maiestie witnesseth in the Conclusion
of his answere to Paulus Quintus his first Breue, [contrary to
his manifold vowes and protestations at the same time, and
as it were with the same breath deliuered to diuers of his Maiesties
Agents abroad] send toSee the Relatition of the whole proceedings against the traitours Garnet and his consederates. 
                     Henry Garnet Iesuite, their
Arch-priest in England, two Bulles to the contrary, the one to
the Clergie, and the other to the Laitie. The Title of the
former was, [Dilectis filijs, Archipresbytero, &amp; reliquo Clero Anglicano,
and the other, Dilectis filijs, principibus, &amp; nobilibus Catholicis
Anglicanis, salutem &amp; Apostolicam Benedictionem: The
summe of both thus: To our Beloued sonnes the Archpriest,
and the Clergie, the Peeres and nobles, Catholikes of England,
greeting and Apostolicall benediction.] The tenor was, [That
after the death of her Maiestie then liuing, whether by course
of nature or otherwise, whosoeuer should layWho was herein touched so neere as his Maiestie.
                      Claime or Title
to the Crowne of England, though neuer so directly and
neerely interessed by discent, should not be admitted to the
throne, vnlesse hee would first tolerate the Romish religion,
and by all his best endeuours promote the Catholike cause, vnto
which by a solemne and sacred Oath, hee should religiously
subscribe after the death of that miserable woman] (for so it
pleased his Holinesse to terme Elizabeth, that most great and
happie Queene;) By vertue of which Bulles, (if vertue may be
in any such vicious libels) the Iesuites disswaded the Romish
minded Subiects, from yeelding in any wise obedience vnto
our most gracious Soueraigne now being. But this not working
to their wished effect, and hee now solemnely proclaimed
with an vniuersall applause, loue, and peace, their hopes
beganne to wither and growe colde; and no succours from
Spaine being now to bee expected, Garnet the Superiour for
the auoyding farther dangers, sacrificed these starued Buls to
the God of fire. Moreouer, in the yeere 1588. when his Holinesse
blessed that inuincible Spanish Nauie, was it to settle the
Crowne vpon his Maiestie after Queene Elizabeth should be
deposed? Surely his Maiestie both rightly conceiued, and
freely expressed the contrary to Sir Robert Sidney, at that time
sent into Scotland from Queene Elizabeth, affirming that hee

expected none other good turne at the Spaniards hands, but that
which Polyphemus promised to Vlisses, that others being first deuoured
himselfe should haue the fauour to bee swallowed last: And
did not the greatest part of Pius his Bull, aiming principally at
her, through her sides also strike his Maiestie? And did not
one Robert Parsons who sate at the helme in Rome, write a certaine
Booke of Titles, intituled Doleman, wherein he excludes
his Maiestie, and prefers the Infant a of Spaines right before
all other pretenders to the Crowne? but when hee once saw
his Maiestie setled beyond all hope and expectation, he made
as you doe, and the rest at that time did, a vertue of necessitie,
acknowledging his vndoubted and lawfull Claime, in his Preface
to his Triple conuersion, whereof for mine owne part I can
giue none other reason then that which you adde to another
purpose, the case is altered: Whiles his Maiestie was onely in
hope you shewed your selues in your owne colours: being
now quiet in possession, you plucke in your hornes, yeelde
to the times, and are content to bee carried with the streame.
                  And though the personall case bee altered in regard of his
Maiestie, and Henry the VIII. yet if his Maiesty either needed
the like dispensations, or had the like will to pull down Churches,
I make no question but his Holinesse would without any
great difficulty giue way to both, conditionally that his pretended,
but vsurped authority might be restored: But as he is
a publique person, and represents the body of the State, the
case is no way different, which is the freeing of it from forraine
and vniust vsurpation: And for Queene Elizabeth I will
be bold to say it, that at her comming to the Crowne, she was
not so farre ingaged for the defence of that religion, which she
constantly maintained to her dying day, as his Maiesty hath by
manifold obligations bound himselfe to the maintenance and
continuance of that which she at her death left, and hee at his
entrance found established amongst vs. For testimonies wee
neede goe no farther then his frequent and solemne protestations,
aswell by his penne, as by word of mouth, and that not
onely before, but since his comming to the Crowne; to which
if we adde the carefull education of his Sonne, the most noble

and hopefull Prince, euen in that respect, the bestowing of his
onely daughter that most sweet and vertuous Lady vpon the
Prince Palatine, not onely a Protestant, but as you terme them,
a Caluinist, the honourable entertainement of Isaac Casaubon,
and Peter Moulin, the liberty giuen to the French &amp; Dutch, for
the free and publike exercise of their religion in diuers parts of
his Maiesties Dominions; and lastly his constant refusall of so
much as the Toleration of any other religion, notwithstanding
the importunitie of suits and supplications for it; the matter as
I suppose will be cleane out of doubt. And as Queene Elizabeth
was prouoked by Pius V. so was his Maiesty by Paulus V.
in a degree very little different; the one absoluing her subiects
from their oath of Allegeance, and the other forbidding his
to take such an oath: So that though the Parenthesis in regard
of personall succession bee ended, yet in respect of profession
(which of the two is the more to bee regarded) the sentence as
yet runnes on, and as we hope will haue no period, but with the
worlds end. But the more to exasperate his Maiesty against
King Henry the VIII. and his daughter Queene Elizabeth, you
tell him that if the Schisme could haue preuented his title, neither
his Mother, nor himselfe should euer haue made Queene Elizabeth
afraid with their right to the Crowne of England. For the
iustnesse of the diuorce I haue already deliuered mine opinion
at large; and yet if any desire farther satisfaction, let him reade
the first dialogue of Antisanderus, who both strongly maintaines
the equity of the Kings proceedings in that businesse,
and clearely confutes the slanders of that base fugitiue; and
for his wiues, had the way bene fairely made vnto them, no iust
exception could be taken to the number. Philip the II. of
Spaine, besides his Mistresses, had successiuelyFrom England. From Portugale. From France. From Austria.
                      foure wiues,
whereof the first was his fathers Cousin germane, and the last his
owne: For the compassing of which, what strange courses he
tooke, I list not to relate, but referre the reader to the Prince
of Aurange his Apologie; yet none that I know hath taxed
him for his multitude of wiues, in as much as he liued and died
a Romane Catholike. Did not Henry the last of France diuorce
his first wife, after they had bene almost as long married, and

vpon lesse shew of iust reason, then Henry the VIII. but the
one made semblance at last of subiecting himselfe to the See
Apostolike, which the other by no meanes could bee brought
vnto, as he did at first, this alone beeing it that varied the case,
and that which he did herein, may well be interpreted to haue
sprong from a desire of setling the Crowne in his owne posterity,
rather then of preiudicing the title of Scotland; For though
during his reigne, some discontentments there were between
the two nations, yet not long before his death hee concluded
a match betwixt his sonne Prince Edward, and Queene Mary of
Scotland, that as his father had vnited the white and the redde
Roses in the royall branches of Yorke and Lancaster, so his sonne
might vnite the Lions passant and rampant, in the armes of England
and Scotland, but it so pleased God, that that match vpon
occasion fell asunder, and that happy vnion was reserued to
our times.
                  Now for Queene Elizabeths feare, those of her Sexe indeed
by their nature are fearefull, and great Princes by reason of the
place they stand in, areDominantibus semperinuisus qu

if hee be potent, if neere at hand, if remote in blood, if in Religion
different: yet all the feare she conceaued from his Masties
Mother arose partly from the practises of the French, with
whose King she matched, and partly of the Seminarie Priests
and Iesuites, and pretended Catholikes, euer making her the
highest marke and pitch of their ambition, till they had
brought her to the lowest ebbe of her misfortune; which was
also hastned through her Subiects feare, rather then their own,
as appeares by her seuerall answeres, and replies to the demands
of the Parliament, and propositions of her counsel touching
that point: as also in that, as soone as the newes of it
was brought to her, not thinking on any such matter, she receiued
it with indignation, her countenance &amp; her speech shewed
it, with excessiue griefe; for a while she stood as it were astonished,
and afterwards betook her selfe in priuate to mourning
and weeping, shee sharpely entertained her counsellers,
remooued them from her presence, and commanded Dauison
her Secretarie, whom shee accused of being more foreward

and officious in that businesse, then she either desired, or expected
to be brought to his triall in the Starre Chamber, where
he was deepely censured in a mulcte of ten thousand pound,
and imprisonment at the Queenes pleasure; but her displeasure
was so heauy against him, that hee continued there long,
and assoone as the excesse of her griefe gaue her leaue, she thus
briefly wrote with her owne hande to the King of Scotland,
now our gracious Soueraigne.

                        I Wish you vnderstood,This Letter was sent by Sr. Robert Cary.
                            but felt not with what
vnmatchable griefe my minde is perplexed,
by reason of that wofull accident executed against
my meaning, which my pen trembling
to mention, you shall vnderstand by this my
cousin. I shall request you that as God, and
many others can testifie mine innocencie herein;
so you would rest assured, that had I commanded
it, I would neuer haue denyed it. I am
not of so base a minde, as either to feare to doe
that which is iust, or to denie it being done. I
am not so degenerate, or of a Spirit so ignoble:
but as it is no Princely part to couer the inward
intention of the minde with the outward
speech; so will I neuer dissemble mine actions,
but labour rather that they may appeare to the
world in their proper colours. Be you therefore
fully resolued as the trueth is, that had I

intended such a matter, I would neuer haue cast
it vpon others; neither haue I reason to charge
my selfe with that which I intended not: For
other matters, this Bearer will impart them to
you; and for my selfe beleeue it, there is none liuing,
that loues you better, and more intirely,
or is more carefully prouident for you, and
your good, and if any happen to suggest any
thing to the contrary, perswade your selfe, that
such thereby aime at their owne aduantage, rather
then yours.
                        
                           God keepe you long and
long in safetie.
                        
                     
                  
                  Yet out of the blacke cloud of this sad accident, did the disposition
of diuine prouidence, as some wise men haue obserued,
most clearely shine, in as much as those things which
both Q. Elizabeth of England, &amp; Q. Mary of Scotland chiefly
desired, and shot at in all their consultations, were by this
meanes effected: The latter (as at her death she witnessed) wished
nothing more earnestly, then that the two diuided
Realmes of England and Scotland might bee vnited in the person
of her dearest sonne: The former, that true Religion, together
with the safetie and securitie of the Kingdome might bee
preserued entire; and that God was pleased to grant both their
wishes, to our comfort, wee feele, and can not but most willingly
acknowledge: And for his Maiestie; he both signified to
Queene Elizabeth by Sir Francis Walsinghame, in the yeere
1583. (almost foure yeeres before his mothers death,) that he
would most constantly maintaine the same Religion which
was then publikely receiued, and againe, sent her the same
message by Sir Robert Sidney about two yeeres after; So that

she needed not to feare his right in that regarde, and for his affection
otherwise, hee both testified it before her death in the
Preface to his Basilicon Doron, where he thus speakes, [In England
reignes a lawfull Queene, who hath so long, with so great wisedome
and felicitie gouerned her kingdomes, as I must in true sinceritie
confesse, that the like hath not beene read or heard of, either in
our time, or since the dayes of the Roman Emperour Augustus.]
And since her death, hee hath yeelded the like testimonies of
her, aswell in his Apologie, as also in his Premonition, where he
remembers, that being chosen to be his Godmother, shee sent
into Scotland the Font wherein he was baptized: So that (if by
outward actions and speeches, we may make coniecture of the
inward thoughts and Passions of the minde) shee was so farre
from fearing his Maiesties right to the Crowne, as she endeuoured
rather by all conuenient meanes to aduance it: neither
doe I find it recorded by her friends, or obiected by her enemies,
that, during all her reigne vpon any occasion, shee euer
conceiued a thought, or cast out a word toward the setting vp
of any other Successour, or the preiudicing of his right; Nay in
the yeere 1587. she sent the Lord Hunsdon gouernour of Berwike
into Scotland, to giue him notice that the Iesuiticall faction
euen while his mother liued, proiected, how they both might
be put by their right, and the Spaniard brought in: and withall
was presented him an instrument, subscribed by the Iudges
of England, assuring him that the sentence passed vpon his
mother, could no way bee preiudiciall in law to the right of

                  But it will be sayd shee discouered her feare in stopping any
declaration of the heire apparent, specially being vrged thereunto
by the three estates assembled in Parliament, in the yeere,
1566. whereas in trueth she in reading might haue obserued,
that few or no Successors in collaterall line had beene declared,

prooued dangerous to name a successour, not only to the possessours,
but sometimes to the Successours themselues: as it

did to Roger Mortimer Earle of March, designed heire to the
Crowne by Richard the second, his sonne Edmund being helde
in prison, and there pining away vpon none other reason. The
like befell Iohn de la Poole, designed by Richard the third (after
the death of his owne sonne) to bee his Successour, himselfe
being alwayes euen in that respect suspected of Henry the VII.
till at last he was slaine, and his brother vnder Henry the VIII.
beheaded. These reasons might mooue her Maiestie for the
stopping of that declaration, not the feare of his Maiesties right,
but the care of preseruing it, being sufficiently proclaimed in
his blood and discent. Whatsoeuer it were, since his Maiestie
who had the neerest interest in that errand, hath bene content
thus graciously to passe it ouer, it cannot but argue want both
of wisdome and charitie in Mr. Doctor, thus vnseasonably, and
maliciously to reuiue it.
                  Lastly, God of purpose no doubt raised vp his Maiestie, to
crosse the worldly and diuelish pretence of Rome, and to perpetuate
the life of that Religion which you call Schisme, and I
make no doubt but if King Henry the VII. had found it left by
his predecessor in the state, that his Maiestie did, hee would in
his wisedome haue left it to his Successor, as hee is like to doe,
and I am the rather induced to thinke so; because in the first
yeere of his raigne, the Pope hauing excommunicated all such
persons as had bought allome of the Florentines, by his permission,
if not command, it was resolued by all the Iudges of England,
that the Popes Excommunication ought not to be obeyed,
or to bee put in Execution within the Realme of England:
and in the same yeere hee suffered sharpe lawes to be made by
the Parliament, to which himselfe gaue, being by his Royall assent
for the reformation of his Clergie, then growen very dissolute:
and in the eleuenth yere of his raigne, a Statute was enacted,
that [though by the Ecclesiasticall Lawes allowed
within this Realme, a Priest cannot haue two Benefices, nor a
bastard be a Priest, yet it should be lawfull for the King to dispence
with both of these, as being mala prohibita, but not mala
per se,] all which argues that they then held the King to bee

                     personam mixtam, as it was declared in the tenth yeere of his
reigne, that is a person mixt, because hee hath both Ecclesiasticall

                  Hauing passed your supposed remoouall of all opposition
both in doctrine and State, thereby to make a readier way to
your imaginary reconciliation, you now come to an endeuour
of clearing such obiections, as you conceiued would offer
themselues; whereof the first is, that the religion established,
(which you call schisme) serues to increase his Maiesties authoritie
and wealth, and therefore it cannot stand with his honour to further
the vnity of the Church of CHRIST: Indeed it must be confessed,
and cannot bee denied, that the religion established,
yeelds his Maiestie the authority due vnto him, which is more
then the Romish yeelds to the Soueraigne Princes of her profession,
and yet no more then CHRIST and his Apostles in
practise yeelded, and in precept command: And yet withall it
cannot be denied, but some of his Maiesties ancestours, partly
through the insensible incrochment of some ambitious Popes,
and partly through the neglect of some weake kings, did part
indeed with some of their authority, to bestow it vpon that
Church, to which you intitle Christ: yet that they reserued to
themselues a power euen in Ecclesiasticall causes, I haue already
made sufficiently to appeare in mine answere to the 16▪ section
of the first chapter, and in diuers other places; to which
I wil presume to adde that, which his Maiesty hath published
to the world touching this very point in his Premonition to
all Christian Princes and States.
                  
                  
                     
[My Predecessors (ye see) of this kingdome,Pag. 28. 29. 30. 31. 32. euen when
the Popes triumphed in their greatnesse, spared not to punish
any of their Subiects that would preferre the Popes obedience
to theirs, euen in Church matters, so farre were they
then from acknowledging the Pope their temporall Superiour,
or yet from doubting that their owne Church men were
not their Subiects. And now I will close vp all these examples
with an Acte of Parliament in King Richard the II. his
time, whereby it was prohibited that none should procure 
                        •
                     
benefice from Rome, vnder paine to be put out of the kings
protection. And thus may ye see that what those kings successiuely
one to another by foure generations haue acted in priuate,
the same was also maintained by a publike law. By these
few examples now I hope I haue sufficiently cleared my
selfe from the imputation, that any ambition or desire of nouelty
in me should haue stirred mee, either to robbe the Pope
of any thing due vnto him, or to assume vnto my selfe any
farther authority, then that which other Christian Emperours
and kings through the world, and my owne Predecessours
of England in especiall haue long agone maintained.
Neither is it enough to say a
                        •
                      Parsons doth in his answere to
the Lord Cooke: that farre more kings of this Countrey haue
giuen many more examples of acknowledging, or not resisting
the Popes vsurped authority; some perchance lacking
the occasion, and some the ability of resisting them: for euen
by the ciuill Law in the case of a violent intrusion, and long
wrongfull possession against me, it is enough if I proue that
I haue made lawful interruption vpon conuenient occasions.]
Hitherto his Maiesty. And I cannot but wonder what Mr. Doctour
meant, (if he had read it,) not to take any notice of it,
or if he reade it not, how he durst presume thus to write to his
Maiesty, without so much as the reading of his writings:
From whence we may gather, that what Henry the VIII▪ acted

in that regard, was but a manifestation of the intents and desires
of his predecessors, which they durst not fully expresse,
and what they enacted, a preparatiue to the roundnesse of his
proceedings.
                  
                  Besides I see not, but if his Maiesties predecessors granted
that to his Holinesse, which was indiuidually annexed to the
Crowne, as being a speciall branch of their prerogatiue
Royall, his Maiestie stands none otherwise bound to maintaine
that graunt, then they held themselues obliged to make
that good, which King Iohn had yeelded vnto him, and if
they did part with their authoritie (as your selfe speake) then
was it their owne before they parted with it, and not the Bishops
of Rome, (as your Romane Catholikes would haue it)
by Diuine right: and consequently beeing their owne, as they
vpon occasion best knowen to themselues, conferred it: so vpon
a contrary occasion (I see no reason, but) either themselues
or their successours might as lawfully resume it: But the
trueth is, that it was not giuen by them, but stollen by the
Bishop of Rome, and by him held vnder colour of prescription,

Neither doeth it follow that his Maiestie in taking the
charge of soules vpon him, according to the qualitie of his office,
and Gods appointment, whose officer hee is, should
therfore be himself a Priest, or be the author of his owne Religion,
as you would maliciously inferre, from the custom of the heathen
Emperors, no more then the Kings of Israel, or the Emperors
of the Christian Primitiue Church were Priests, or authors
of that religion, which by diuine ordinance they tooke care of,
aswell in the Priest, as in the people, aswell in confirming and
countenancing what was in order, as in censuring and restoring
what was amisse: neither was it in the time of the law of nature
held vnlawfull, that both the Regall and the Ecclesiasticall,
the princely and the priestly power should reside together
in one person, during which Law wee haue not many
examples of Kings that gouerned a people, where the
Church of God was planted: there is onely mention to my remembrance
of Melchisedecke King of Salem,
                     Gen. 14. 19. and of him it is
sayd withall, that hee was a Priest of the most High God;
so that in his person these two offices, the principalitie and
the Priesthood, were ioyned; both which followed the prerogatiue
of the birth-right: and to this double dignity was answerable
a double portion: the like do we reade of Anias, that

so much in open shew, and plaine termes; but hath
effected no lesse, nay more, indeede, and in trueth, in making
the Papacie the Substantiue, and the Empire the Adiectiue:
But among Christians, (saith our Dr.) the Spirituall and Temporall
authoritie haue two beginnings, as if hee who gaue his Apostles
Commission to preach the Gospel, did not also proclaime
in the eight of the Prouerbes [Matth. 28. 18. 
                     By me Kings reigne] it is

there deliuered in the person of wisedome, by which no doubt
is to be vnderstood the second person in Trinitie, the wisedome
of the Father. It may be his meaning is, that the Spirituall authority
is from the good God, and the Temporall from the euill
god, distinguishing as the Manicheans did: Or that the Spirituall
is from God, and the Temporall from the people; or the
Spirituall from Christ, and the Temporall from Antichrist: Howsoeuer
from a double beginning he inferres a double Supremacie,
whereas to speake properly; that is onely Supreme which
giues beginning, and not that which receiues, howbeit in
themselues (since the institution of the Leuiticall Law) wee
must confesse them distinct and independant, the Priest depending
on the Prince, in regard of externall coactiue iurisdiction,
but not of inward vocation, or outward ordination:

haue bene as two heads, without any appeale either from each
to other, or to any Superior: But when once they had a King,
appeales lay to him from both. Thus did SaintActs 25. 11. 
                     Paul appeale
from the high Priest of his owne Nation to Caesar though an
Heathen Emperour, and from him was there no appeale at all:
So that the Spirituall authoritie was then subordinate to the
Temporall: but when once it began to interpose it selfe in Temporall
affaires, and within a while after to oppose it selfe against
the Temporall power, it made a ready way to the destruction
of both.

                  If the Crowne haue more Pence paid in now then in former times,
it must needes follow, that were it not by default of officers

the meanes might bee greater to doe great workes both in
peace and in warre; &amp; whereas you vpbraid his Maiestie, that
his are but yet hoped for, hee hath had other occasions (as the
world well knoweth) of expence, then his ancestors had, and
those occasions that they had, hee hath not, whether in
building at home, or in warring abroad: theirs it may be were
more conspicuous, but his more necessary; and yet I doubt
not but vpon iust occasion his Maiestie would bee able to
maintaine as great and as powerfull an armie as any of his predecessors,
to the terror of Rome and the Romanists, who are so
farre from complaining of his Maiesties wants, as they would
rather triumph most in this, that hee were not rich. Gretser,
(in your account, I am sure a good Catholike) complaines not,
butscoffes at his Maiesties neede of money, in his answere to
Monsieur Plessis his Epistle Dedicatory to his Maiesty, prefixed
to his Mysteriū iniquitatis; in which his Maiestie being incouraged
by that noble Lord, to lay by his Pen, and take his sword
in hand, though it were to the passing of the Alps, and the
sacking of Rome, Gretser in his replie makes it the burden of
his song in diuers periods, Sed deest pecunia. But the onely sure
way (you say) for his Maiestie to inrich himselfe, is, to turne Romane
Catholike; as if it were not fresh in memorie what infinite
masses of treasure the pretence of that Religion carried
out of the land, to the triple Crowne of Rome, and other forreiners,
well neere as much as was brought to the Crowne of
England it selfe; as appeares in Bonners Preface to Gardiners oration
of true obedience: In the reigne of King Henry the third,
it amounted by iust computation, to the summe of 60000.
markes, which amounts to an incredible masse at this day, and
was more then the standing reuenues of the Crowne at that
time, as the Author of the British antiquities reports it, out of
Matthew Paris, in the life of Boniface, Archbishop of Canterburie:
in which relation are also set downe the grieuances which
the Bishops, the Abbots, the Barons, and the king himselfe exhibited
in their seuerall Letters to his Holinesse, touching the
grieuousnesse of his exactions, the effect whereof was as followeth.
                  
                     
                      That the Pope being not content with that
aide which is called Peter-pence, hee made
money here in England, by a thousand cunning
sleights and trickes, without the consent
of the King, against the ancient Right
and Liberties of the Kingdome, and against
the Appeales put in by the Kings Ambassadours
and Proctors in the Council of Lions.
                  
                  
                      That the Benefices and Prebendaries in England,
were by him conferred vpon Italians
and Romanes, not able to speake, or so much
as to vnderstand our language, and that
many times, one Italian succeeded another,
as in lawfull inheritance: the Church reuenues
being by this meanes wasted and
caried out of the kingdome, the word of
God not preached, Ecclesiasticall dueties
not obserued, hospitality, almes, and Diuine
Seruice neglected, and lastly the walles and
roofe of Chancels and Parsonage houses
suffered to drop downe, to the indangering
of many soules, and the vtter desolation of
the Church.
                  
                      That of those Churches into which hee
thrust not strangers, he exacted Pensions,
against his owne promise by letter.
                  
                     
                      That the natiue English were vpon all occasions
drawen by Citations to the Court
of Rome, against the Customes and Common
Law of the Kingdome, and against the
Popes owne priuiledges, formerly granted.
                  To like purpose is that which I finde in a Manuscript of
Mr. Hales, a man renowned in his time, aswell for his learning
as his honestie; his words are these, speaking of the cunning
fetches of the Bishops of Rome, for the enriching of themselues
and their Clergie, to the impouerishing of the King
and the State.
                  First (saith hee) they exempted the Clergy, aswell
the Secular as the regular, from the authoritie
of the Kings of England, whereby
they neither would obey the Prince, but
when and wherin it pleased them, nor albeit
they had the greater part of the possessions
and profits of the Realme, they would
be contributory to the charges of the defence
thereof, but when it listed them.
                  Secondly, they reserued to themselues the collations
generally &amp; specially of all Archbishopricks,
Bishopricks, Abbies, Priories, &amp;
all other dignities and benefices in England,
which many times they gaue to aliants, that
neuer dwelt in England, nor euer came into
England. So the reuenues thereof were not

spent in the Realme, but caried out of the
same, &amp; when they gaue them to any of the
Realme, they made them pay exceeding
summes of money for Palls, Annats, First
fruits, Tenths, and such like, whereby the
Realme from time to time was very much
impouerished.
                  Thirdly, they vsed to dispence, not onely with
their owne Lawes and Canons, but also many
times with Gods word in matters of Matrimony,
and otherwise, whereby they sucked
no litle treasure out of the Realme.
                  Fourthly, in causes testamentary, in causes of
Matrimony, and diuorces, right of tithes,
oblations, and obuentions, they had decreed
that men might appeale from any
Court within this Realme to the Court of
Rome, whereby the people of this nation
was very much troubled, by reason it was so
farre distant from this Realme, and when
they came thither, they could not in long
time haue redresse, but with long delayes
were constrained to spend whatsoeuer they
had.
                  Fiftly, with dispensations for eating flesh, and
white meates, for pardons and redemption

of soules out of Purgatory, for dispensations
with vowes, and such like beggery, they
scraped together infinite summes of money:
and because no fish should escape for lacke
of bait, they had their Dataries and Collectours
continually gaping for the prey, resident
here in England.
                  
                  Lastly, the Clergie of this Realme being animated
by the authority of the Bishop of
Rome, the Arch-bishops, Bishops, and such
as had Spirituall Iurisdiction within this
Realme, not onely vnreasonably troubled,
and vexed the people of this realme in their
Courts, but also exceedingly pilled, polled
and robbed them vnder colour of Fees and
duties. The Parsons and Vicars were not
content with the moderate Mortuaries and
Corse-presents, but also daily increased the
same, and would haue what it pleased them,
without any consideration of the misery
and pouerty of the widow and children liuing,
yea, and many times where the dead
had but a bare vse, and no property in the
goods and chattels, they were found in his
possession, and in many places they would
neither baptize nor marry, nor bury, but

they would haue some extraordinary reward,
&amp; the common sort of Priests would
not depart with any their Masses or praiers,
vnlesse they were sure to haue money.
                  Of these and the like most vnsufferable vexations, Iohn of Sarisbury
in his 6. booke, and 24. chapter De nugis Curalium,
complaines. Polidor Virgil himselfe an Italian, in his 8th.
booke and second chapter De inuentoribus rerum, is not sparing
in the relation of them: and the booke aboue mentioned,
intituled Antiquitates Britannicae is so full of them, as it seemes
to haue bene written to none other purpose: which notwithstanding
I finde not gainesaid by any Romanist. And can wee
expect then that his Maiesty by the helpe of Romish Catholike Religion,
should euer bee enriched? Surely in reason, that which is
the meanes of impouerishing his Realme, and his subiects, can
not be a meanes of inriching him: [In the want of people (saith

                  But saith Mr. Doctour, one of the maine pretenses of Henry
the VIII. was, to enrich himselfe in the spoile of the Church, which
notwithstanding in euent proued to be contrary; to which I reply
with the Poet,

                        —Careat successibus opto
                        Quisquis ab euentu facta not anda putat.
                     
Actions are not so much to be measured by their issues and
euents, as by the causes from which they spring, and the
ends to which they are directed.Exod. 36. When the people exceeded
too much in offring gifts toward the worke of the Sanctuary,
by the discretion of Moses they were restrained, and a proclamation
made throughout the Campe they should bring no
more: Why should it not be as lawfull for Henry the VIII. to
restore it backe againe to the owners, if too much were giuen,
as for Moses to restraine them for giuing: hee tooke it out of

their hands who vpon al occasions at the Popes command were
ready to vse it as a weapon against himselfe, and in defence of
their holy Father, and conferd it vpon those who therewith
were to serue both himselfe and the State in peace at home,
and in wars abroad. As the Church prayes for the ciuill state;
so is it to shield the Church: and better it were the Church
should quit a part of her maintenance, then that the whole
should lie obnoxious to the 
                        •
                     acrilegious hands of forreine vsurpation:
If in performance hereof, that which should haue
bene ordained to publike, or sacred, was by some ill disposed
persons, or the king himselfe, turned to priuate and prophane
vses; or if that which inseperably belongs to the maintenance
of Ecclesiasticall persons, were put into the possession of those
who serued not at the altar, this manner of proceeding might
so staine and vitiate the whole action, as it might carry a secret
curse with it vpon the authours and actours of it. No doubt
but a good cause, and in it selfe most iust both may bee and oft
is marred in the handling: and being handled neuer so well, yet
in the issue it may miscarry, Gods iudgements being alwayes
in themselues most iust, but many times their causes hidden
from vs. I vndertake not the defence of Henry, or any other
Prince or person in robbing the Church, but to his vnfortunate
euents, we may oppose the happy successe of Queene Elizabeth
his daughter, and successour both in gouernment and
in opposition to the Church of Rome: She maintained long
and chargeable wars, in diuers kingdomes abroad, against Balak
and Balaam, Gog and Magog, to the infinite expense of her
treasure, and yet at her death she left more in her coffers then
her Romish Catholike sister, and immediate predecessour, notwithstanding
her peace abroad, her mariage with the Lord of
the Indies, and her readmittance (though with much adoe) of
the Popes authority.
                  Lastly for full satisfaction in this point, Mr. Doctor hauing
so good intelligence of his Maiesties disposition, and being so
inwardly acquainted with his secrets, as he makes himselfe,
could not well be ignorant that his Maiesty▪
                      is so farre from inriching,
or hoping to inrich himselfe in the spoile of the Church, vnder

colour of religion, that to his immortall fame since his comming
to the Crowne,See the Statute. he hath bound his owne hands and his
posterity from alienating the reuenues consecrated to the
Churches vse: so that your inuectiue in this place is malicious
against King Henry, if in no other regard, yet because it is
impertinent in regard of his Maiesty, who hath no Monasteries
to pull downe, nor (as your selfe before confesse) will to pull
downe Churches: but though he haue no will to pull downe Churches,
but rather to set them vp, it followes not, but that he
should be willing to

he is set by God as the chiefe Gouernour) from the spoile and
tyrannie of forreine vsurpers: Nay the latter may not vnfitly
be inferred vpon the former: And if in regard of that preseruation
onely wee now pay his Maiesty what those tyrants formerly
receiued, he receiues nothing but what he rightly may,
nor we pay but what in duety and conscience we ought.

                  There is yet another obiection or two in reason of state, concerning
your Maiesty, which seeme to be harder to answere then all the
rest: Whereof the one is, that your Maiestie hath vndertaken the
cause in writing, and set out a booke in print, and it must needes be

singular gifts, as to giue occasion to such an Obiection. Hee was
no foole that pronounced that Cōmon-wealth happy, where
learned men had the gouernment, or the gouernors were learned:
and another who holds those wise men in the Gospel who
came from the East, are therefore held Kings, because they
were learned, which I speake not to derogate frō other Kings,
but to thanke God for our owne, whose drops that fall both
from his tongue and Pen are as the Prophet Dauid speakes in
another case, like raine falling vpon the mowen grasse, or as
showers that water the earth. We haue read in our own Chronicles
of one Bladud a Brittish King, who studied at Athens, of
Alured a Saxon King, who translated the Psalter into his own
language, of Henry a Norman King, who for his great schollership
was surnamed the Beauclarke, but for a King (only Dauid
and Salomon excepted) that hath written so much, and so
well as his Maiestie, &amp; exposing it to publike censure, hath left
it as an euerlasting monumēt of his name to posterity, for mine
owne part I must confesse in my small reading, I haue not met
with any, either in our owne or forreine History: Some Kings
haue done some what in this kinde, but hee excelleth them all:

so that for a Christian King to write and to publish his writings
to the world, euen in matter of Religion, is not without
example. The Booke of Charlemaine in defence of the decree of
the Synode of Frankeford, which himselfe had thither called,
and against the Canons of the second Nicene Council, touching
the controuersie of adoring images, is yet extant to bee seene
in the Palatine library: &amp; so is it acknowledged by Augustinus
Steuchus in his second booke of Constantines donation, where
hee presses some things in that Booke for the Popes aduantage:
Howbeit Bellarmine in his second Booke of Images and 15th.
Chapter, labourto prooue the contrary, granting that it was
sent by that Emperour to Pope Adrian, but not as his owne.
His Maiesties Bookes, aswell the former in defence of the Oath
of Allegeance, as the later by way of Premonition to the Christian
States, are no doubt, as great corrasiues and eyesores to
you, as to vs they are cordiall and comfortable: and cannot be
but to him as dishonourable, if hee should recall them, as now
they are honourable if hee continue constant to himselfe and
them.
                  Now that they should proceede rather from the instigation of
others, then his owne disposition, is a surmise of your owne, I
know not, whether more foolish, as being ignorant of that
which hee had both written and spoken and done since hee
came to yeeres of discretion conformably thereunto, or dishonest
in calling his Maiesties singular wisedome into question,
in suffering himselfe to bee so farre abused, as vnwittingly
to bee sent on other mens errands, and to serue other mens
turnes.
                  
                  
                     Howsoeuer, there is nothing (you say) in that booke (by which
you cannot but vnderstand both the Premonition, and the Apologie,
both bound together in one volume, and titled together
in one front) why his Maiestie may not when he please admit the
Popes Supremacie in Spirituals: wherein first you dash (though
peraduenture vnawares) against your great Cardinal, who in
his Letter to Blackwell, professeth, [that in whatsoeuer words
the Oath of Allegeance (in defence of which his Maiestie
wrote his Apologie) bee conceiued, it tends to none other

end, but that the authorie of the head of the Church of England,
may bee transferred from the Successour of S. Peter to
the Successour of K. Henry the VIII.] this indeed he affirmes
falsly, but both in his Tortus against his Maiesties Apologie, and
in his Apologie against his Maiesties Premonition, hee affirmeth
truely that the vsurped Supremacy of the Bishop of Rome
is in them both impugned: And I cannot but marueile at such
shamelesse impudencie as dares thus to write to his Maiestie
touching his owne writings, whose very words toward the later
end of his Apologie are these (discoursing before of the Supremacie
of K. Henry the VIII. in Church-matters, for which
Bishop Fisher, and Sir Thomas Moore were pretended to haue
suffered.) [I am sure (saith hee) that the Supremacie of Kings
may and will euer be better maintained by the word of God (which
must euer be the true rule to discerne all weighty heads of doctrine
by) to bee the true and proper office of Christian Kings in their owne
dominions, then hee will euer be able to maintaine his annihilating
Kings and their authorities, together with his base and vnreuerent
speaches of them, wherewith both his former great volumes
and his late bookes against Venice are filled.] Where he goes on
and proues this Supremacie aswell by the Old as the New Testament,
and the practise both of the Kings of Israel and the
Christian Emperours in the Primitiue Church, both explaning
and iustifying the Oath of Supremacie, as it is by him imposed,
and taken by vs, and in his Premonition written afterward
(though set before in the Booke) he is so cleere in this
point, that Mr. Dr. cannot but stand conuinced either of grosse
negligēce in not reading, or vnpardonable forgetfulnes in not
remembring what he had read: His Maiesties words are these:
[But as I well allow of the Hierarchie of the Church for distinction
of orders (for so I vnderstand it) so I vtterly deny
that there is an earthly Monarch thereof, whose word must
be a Law, and who cannot erre in his sentence by an infabilitie
of spirit. Because earthly Kingdomes must haue earthly
Monarchies; it doth not follow that the Church must haue
a visible Monarch too: for the world hath not one earthly

Temporall Monarch. Christ is his Churches Monarch, and
the holy Ghost his Deputie,Luke 22. 25. 
                     Reges gentium dominantur
eorum, vos autem non sic. Christ did not promise before
his Ascension to leaue Peter with them to direct and instruct
them in all things,Iohn 14. 26. but he promised to send the holy
Ghost vnto them to that end. And for these two before cited
places, whereby Bellarmine maketh the Pope to triumph
ouer Kings; I meaneIohn 21. 15. 16. 17.

of Tibi dabo are in another place spoken by Christ in the
plurall number: and hee likewise knowes what reasons the
ancients doe giue why Christ bade Peter Pasce oues: and
also what a cloud of witnesses there is, both of ancients, and
euen of late Popish Writers, yea diuers Cardinals, that doe
all agree, that both these speeches vsed to Peter were meant
to all the Apostles represented in his person, otherwise how
could Paul direct the Church of Corinth to excommunicate
the Incestuous person Cum Spiritu suo,
                     1. Cor. 5. 4. whereas he should
then haue sayed Cum Spiritu Petri? and how could all
the Apostles haue otherwise vsed all their censures only in
Christs Name, and neuer a word of his Vicars? Peter we
read did in all the Apostles meetings sit among them as one
of their number,Acts 15. and when chosen men were sent to Antiochia
from that Apostolike Councell at Ierusalem, the
text sayeth, it seemed good to the Apostles and Elders, with
the whole Church to send chosen men, but no mention made
of the head thereof; and so in their Letters no mention is
made of Peter, but onely of the Apostles, Elders, and Brethren.
And it is a wonder why Paul rebuketh the Church
of Corinth, for making exception of persons,1. Cor. 1. 11. because
some followed Paul, some Apollos, some Cephas; if Peter
was their visible head: for then those that followed not

                     Peter or Cephas renounced the Catholike Faith: But it
appeareth well, that Paul knew little of our new doctrine,
since he handleth Peter so rudely,Gal. 2. as hee not only compareth;
but preferreth himselfe vnto him: But our Cardinall
prooues Peters Superiority by Pauls going to visite him:
Indeed Paul sayeth, he went to Ierusalem to visite Peter,
and to conferre with him:Gal. 1. 18. but he should haue added, and
to kisse his feet: To conclude then, the trueth is, that

                        eter was both in age, and in the time of Christs calling
him one of the first of the Apostles: in order the principall
of the first twelue, and one of the three, whome Christ for
orders sake preferred to all the rest, and no further did the
Bishop of Rome claime for three hundreth yeere after
Christ: Subiect they were to the generall Councels, and euen
but of late did the Councell of Constance depose three
Popes, and set vp the fourth, and till Phocas dayes, that
murthered his Master, were they subiect to Emperours:
But how they are now come to bee Christs Vicars, Gods on
earth, Triple Crowned Kings of Heauen, Earth, and Hell,
Iudges of all the world, and none to iudge them, heads of the
Faith, absolute deciders of all controuersies by the infallibilitie
of their spirit▪ hauing all power both Spirituall and
Temporall in their hands, the high Bishops, Monarchs of
the whole earth, Superiours to all Emperours, and Kings,
yea Supreme Vice-gods, who, whether they will or not, can
not erre. How they are now come, I say to this top of greatnesse
I know not: but sure I am, Wee that are kings, haue
greatest need to looke to it. As for me, Paul and Peter I
know, but these men I know not, and yet to doubt of this, is
to denie the Catholike Faith, nay, the Word it selfe must be

(making the left hand to haue the place before the right,)

that this Primacie may be maintained.] Thus we see how
clearely and strongly his Maiestie both in his Apologie proues
the Supremacie of Kings in causes Ecclesiasticall, and disproues
in his Premonition the pretended Supremacie of Popes, euen in
Spirituals, denying them to be Christs Vicars, Peters Successors,
visible Monarchs, heads of the Faith, deciders of all controuersies,
high Priests, vniuersall Bishops, and destroying
the two maine grounds of that Monarchie, the Supremacie of
S. Peter, and their infallibilitie in iudging.
                  
                  Truely in the Writing hereof mee thought I was touched
with shame and pittie, that a Diuine should with such palpable
falshoods, belie his Soueraigne, and gull the world, and a
Doctor of Diuinitie so fowlie stumble in so plaine and manifest
a case: howbeit it cannot be denyed to be true, which he
addes, that his Maiestie by that Booke is partly ingaged to admit
the triall of the first generall Councels, and the most ancient Fathers.
                  
                  
                     For the Councels [I reuerence and admit (saith hee)
the foure first generall Councels as Catholike &amp; Orthodoxe,
and the said foure generall Councels are acknowledged by
our Acts of Parliament, and receiued for Orthodoxe by our
Church. And for the Fathers (saith hee) I reuerence
them as much and more then the Iesuits doe, for what euer
the Fathers, for the first fiue hundred yeeres, did with an
vnanime consent agree vpon, to be beleeued as a necessarie
point of saluation, I either will beleeue it also, or at least will
be humbly silent, not taking vpon me to condemne the same:
but for euery priuate Fathers opinion, it bindes not my conscience
more then Bellarmines, euery one of the Fathers
vsually contradicting others. I will therefore in that case
follow S. Augustines rule in iudging of their opinions, as
I find them agree with the Scriptures: what I find agreeable
thereunto I will gladly imbrace, what is otherwise I
will with their reuerence reiect.] So that his Maiestie admitteth
                     
the foure first Councels, not as Diuine Oracles, or as the
foure Gospels, but as Catholike and Orthodoxe, and reuerenceth
the most ancient Fathers, not as the holy Scriptures,
but as consonant thereunto.
                  
                  And if that triall should be made, your holy Father would
thereby gaine as litle for the countenancing of his vsurped Supremacie,
as Zozimus, Boniface, and Celestine his Predecessours,
in forging a Canon of the first Nicene Councell for their
pretended Iurisdiction in appeales, and labouring to force the
Councell of Carthage thereunto, whereas that Councell in
precise termes confineth other Bishops, and Patriarchs to the
exercise of their iurisdictiō within their own Diocesses or Prouinces,
as the Custome of the Bishop of Rome was, the words
are these,Can. 6. [Let old Customes be kept: they that are in Egypt, and
Lybia, and Pentapolis: that the Bishop of Alexandria haue the
preheminence of all these, because such is the Custome of the Bishop
of Rome too: likewise also in Antioch and in other Prouinces, let
the Churches enioy their dignities and prerogatiues] which words
of the Councel grounding on the Custome of the B. of Rome,
that as he had preeminence of all the Bishops about him: so
Alexandria and Antioch should haue of all about them; and
likewise other Churches, as the Metropolitan each in their
owne Prouinces, doe shew that the Pope neither had preeminence
of all through the world before the Nicene Councell,
nor ought to haue greater preeminence by their iudgement
then he before time had.
                  This Councell was called about 327. yeeres after Christ,
and there met in it 318. Bishops, the chiefe lights of Christian
Religion at that time, Ambrose saying,In prefat. lib. de fide. that their number
was mistically prefigured in those 318. Souldiers, by whome
Abraham got the victory ouer the fiue Kings.
                  
                  The second generall Councell was helde at Constantinople,
against Macedonius, who denyed the Diuinitie of the holy
Ghost consisting of 150. Bishops, about the yeere 383. called
by Theodosius the Elder, who both prescribed the place
and time, the matter to be discussed, and maner of proceeding
in it, sent his Deputie thither to supplie his roome, as moderator

or president for the keeping of order &amp; obseruing of decencie,
and lastly by his Imperiall power, ratified the Decrees
thereof: all which acts flowing from the prerogatiue of his
place and office, are now denyed by the Pope and his flatterers
any way to belong to Emperours, or Christian Princes:
besides this, the Councell it selfe layed a foundation for that
which the fourth generall Councell further built vpon, in equalizing
the See of Constantinople, or new Rome to that of
the olde.
                  The thirde generall Councell was held at Ephesus in the
yeere 430. summoned by Theodosius the younger against the
Nestorian heresie, which diuided Christ into two persons, it
consisted of 200. Bishops: This Councell (in which S. Cyrill
was president) not onely prescribed and limited the Popes Legate,
and others that were sent in ambassage to the Prince,
what they should doe, but added this threatning, [Scire autem
volumus vestram Sanctitatem, quòd si quid horum contemptum fuerit,
ne

                         vos Communionis sinet
esse participes: Wee giue your Holinesse to vnderstand, that if
any of these things (which we haue appointed you) be omitted
by you, neither will this holy Synode ratifie your actes,
nor receaue you to the Communion:] By which it is euident
that the lawful and generall Councell of Ephesus, thought they
might, and sayd they would; not onely controle; but euen excommunicate
the Popes Vicegerent, if hee did not that which
was enioyned him by the Synode.
                  The fourth and last generall Councell which his Maiestie
reuerenceth as Orthodoxe, was the great Councel of Chalcedon,
consisting of 630. Bishops, called by Martian the Emperour
in the yeere 454. against Eutiches, who in extreame
opposition to Nestorius confounded the natures of Christ, making
of two distinct natures but one, whereas Nestorius rent
asunder his person, making of one two. This great Councell
then gaue the Bishop of Constantinople equall priuiledges
with the Bishop of Rome, as may appeare in the fifteenth
Acte of that Councell, and when Paschasinus and Lucentius,
who represented the person of Leo, then Bishop of Rome, the

next day desired of the noble men that sate there by the Emperours
appointment, as Iudges and Moderatours, that the
matter might be brought about againe, and put to voices, pretending
that it was not orderly past, the Councell that in the
absence of the Popes Legates had made this Decree, in their
presence confirmed the same, they contradicting and labouring,
as it had beene for their liues to withstand it.
                  And since his Maiestie and the Realme haue vndertaken
the defence of these foure Councils, it were to bee wished
they might, if not otherwise, yet by publike authority▪ bee
faithfully translated by some chosen men of our owne, out of
their Originals; and where diuerse readings offer themselues
vpon comparing of the best printed Copies and Manuscripts,
the most likely might bee giuen; the worke would not bee
great and the benefit in my iudgement issuing from thence
not small.
                  Now for such things as may in shew bee drawen out of
these Councils to make against vs, and for the Church of
Rome, I referre the reader toPag. 89, 90, 91, 92. 93. 
                     Bellarmines Apologie against his
Maiesties Premonition, where hee hath put together whatsoeuer
either diligence could obserue, or malice wrest, so that
whosoeuer shall now gleane after him, shall gaine as little credite
to himselfe, as aduantage to his cause, yet whatsoeuer he
hath said, or for his purpose pressed from thence, is so fully and
sufficiently answered by a reuerend &amp; learnedEpisc. Eli. in respons. ad Apol. Card. Bellar. pag. 167, 168, 169, 170▪ 171, 172. Prelate of our
owne, as if our Doctor would haue dealt either as a Scholler,
or an honest man, hee should first haue vndertaken the confutation
of that answere, before hee had againe pressed his Maiestie
with the triall of those Councils.
                  
                  From the first Generall Councils, hee proceedes to the
most ancient Fathers; but what neede any farther question of

                     aking, met together
in Councill? His Maiestie confines himselfe to the first
500. yeeres, and to their Vnanime consent, and that in matters
of saluation, and all this granted, hee doth not alwayes promise
a stedfast beleefe, but an humble silence. Now Bellarmine,
despairing belike, to put the matter to the triall of their

testimonies, complaines that his Maiestie descends not lower,
and stoopes aswell to the later writers, as Bonauent

according to the qualitie of the Regions through which they

so did they of the ages in which they liued. And for the most
ancient, Bellarmine himselfe commonly dazels the eyes of the
world, either with the bastardy of false, or the corruptiō of true
Fathers, whom hee esteemes, as they make more or lesse for his
purpose, none otherwise then merchants doe their casting
counters; sometimes in his valuation they stand for pounds,
sometimes for shillings, sometimes for pence, sometimes for
nothing.Lib. 5. vltra med. in Apol. 1. &amp; 2. sapius repetit.

Church of God, the defence of things superfluous, impertinent,
false, naught, contrary to themselues, presumption, frowardnesse,
peruersenesse, blindnesse of heart, inflexible obstinacie:
Lastly, how Athanasius that renowned Patriarch of Alexandria,
that stout champion of IESVS CHRIST, that pillar
of the Church, and hammer of Heretikes, was persecuted
for the Catholike faith, Pope Liberius consenting and subscribing
to the Synodal sentence, whereby he was excluded from
the Communion of the Church, as witnessethPag. 474.

the sixt Councill of Carthage (in which S. Augustine was a
member) to the vniust claime of three succeeding Popes, Zozimus,
Boniface and Celestine, in the high businesse of Appeales;
hee might in good discretion haue forborne to presse his Maiestie
to the triall of the most ancient Fathers.
                  
                  Now touching the question of Antichrist, it is not discussed
by his Maiestie as an hypotheticall proposition, but as his opinion,
his Maiesties words are these, [As for the definition of Antichrist
I will not vrge so obscure a point as a matter of faith to be necessarily
beleeued of all Christians, but what I thinke herein I will
simply declare.] Cardinall Peron indeed makes the proposition
of deposing Kings, to bee problematicall, and yet withall a
part of the Catholike faith; but his Maiestie, though he make
his opinion of Antichrist no part of his faith, yet beeing his
opinion, in regard of his apprehension, you cannot make it
hypotheticall, which hee also declared to bee his iudgement before
his comming to the Crowne of England, by his Commentarie
on certaine verses of the 20th. Chapter of the Reuelation of
S. Iohn, neither is his Maiestie the onely King that hath been
of that opinion. You may remember not long since one of

the French, who stamped on his coyne, Perdam Babylonem;
vntill then, his Maiesties substantiall and weighty reasons touching
that point, bee disprooued, I see no reason hee hath to
recall what hee hath written; in the meane time his Maiestie
may more iustly take vp that, then the Author of it, [Iohn 19. 22. what

                  Lastly, for the example of Henry the VIII. it is both false
and impertinent, false, in that you say he contradicted his booke,
whereas his booke (as I haue already shewed) is onely touching
the seuen Sacraments, which he held to his dying day:
impertinent, in that you take it as granted that his Maiesty by
recalling himselfe should alter from lesse good to much better,
which is the thing alwayes by vs denied, but neuer was or euer
can be proued by you. Indeed we find that S. Augustine made
his Retractations from naught or lesse good to better, and Bellarmine
in his Recognitions from bad to worse, and Dr. Carier to
haue fallen from a formall Protestant, to a professed Papist: and
as our Sauiour speakes to Saint Peter, thou being conuerted,
strengthen thy brethren; So hee contrariwise being himselfe
peruerted, labours to weaken his Maiesties faith, but it is
grounded on that Rocke, against which the gates of hell with
their power, much lesse the instruments of Rome with their
foisting and cogging shall neuer be able to preuaile.

and die out of charity, which although it bee not so horrible to the

on the sudden, and there is as much difference betwixt the anger
of a priuate man, and the indignations of a Prince, as betwixt a
blast vpon the riuer which is soone downe, and a storme vpon the sea,
which hauing raised the billowes to the height, is nourished by the
motion thereof, and cannot settle againe in a long time; but there is
a time for all things, and seuen yeeres is a long time. When a man is in
the midst of his anger, it pleaseth him not to bee intreated by his
neighbours, much lesse by his seruants, but when a man hath chidden
and punished vntill he is weary, hee will bee content to heare his

                  You come at last to the greatest obiection, as you terme it,
which is the Gun-powder treason, but doubtlesse in the iudgement
of any indifferent reader, you say least in the clearing of
it, seeming rather in conclusion to referre it to a farther hearing,
then for the present to answere the obiection, or excuse
the plot: That which you haue to say, is, that there is a time for
all things, and God himselfe is exorable, as if his Maiesty were
mercilesse and inexorable: whereas hee proceeded vpon the
discouery of that most barbarous designe, with such rare clemency
and singular moderation, that iustice was onely taken
vpon the very actors, and offenders themselues, and that in
as honourable and publike a forme of triall, as euer was vsed
in this kingdome; and [although (as his Maiesty himselfe hath
well obserued) the onely reason they gaue for plotting so hainous an
attempt was, the zeale they caried to the Romish Religion; yet were
neuer any other of that profession the worse vsed for that cause,] as
by his Maiesties gracious Proclamation, immediately after
the discouery of the said fact, doth plainely appeare, onely at
[the next sitting down againe of the Parliament, were there Lawes
made, enacting some such orders as were thought fit for the preuenting
the like mischiefe in time to come, amongst which a forme of
oath was framed, to bee taken by his subiects, whereby they should
make a cleare profession of their resolution, faithfully to persist in
their obedience, according to their naturall allegeance, to the end
a separation might bee made betweene so many of his Maiesties
Subiects, who although they were otherwise Popishly affected,
yet retained in their hearts the print of their naturall Allegeance

to their Soueraigne, and those who being caried away
with the like fanaticall zeale that the Powder-traitours
were, could not containe themselues within the bounds of their naturall
Allegeance; but thought diuersitie of Religion a safe pretext
for all kinde of Treasons and Rebellions against their Soueraigne:]
Which godly and wise intent God blessed with successe
accordingly; for very many Subiects that were Popishly
affected, aswell Priests, as Laickes, did freely take the same
oath, whereby they both gaue his Maiestie occasion to thinke
the better of their fidelitie, and likewise freed themselues of
that heauie slaunder, that [although they were Fellow-professours
of one Religion with the Powder-traitors, yet were they not ioyned

whereby all quietly minded Papists were put out of despaire, and his
Maiestie gaue good proofe, that hee intended no persecution against
them for conscience sake; but onely desired to be secured of them for
ciuill obedience, which for conscience sake they were bound to performe]
I vse his Maiesties very words, because he is best able
to expresse himselfe, and I know not how to expresse my selfe
better, nor by many degrees so well.
                  These were the greatest effects of his Maiesties anger vpon
occasion of the Powder-treason, which notwithstanding, to shew
your Rhetorike, you compare to a storme vpon the Sea raising vp
the billowes to the height, making him inexorable, impatient of any
equall hearing, chiding and punishing, vntill he were weary: wheras
if his Mai

the chiefe offenders (no doubt) had beene torne in pieces
before they could haue come to the place of execution,
or of triall, and if the like monstrous, and neuer heard of offence
had beene committed by Protestants, for their Religions
sake in other countries, the body of that profession had
suffered for it. Indeed his Maiestie had sufficient occasion giuen,
that his wrath should haue beene as the roaring of a Lyon,
which is the Herauld of death: but bearing the Image of God,
and being the Vicegerent of God on earth, nay stiled God, by
God himselfe, his mercy so tri

                     mphed against his iustice, that
he seemed not to be mooued as the hainousnes of so horrible

a fact required, vntill his Holinesse by his two Breues, and Cardinall
Bellarmine by his Letter to the Arch-priest, throughly
awakened him, they thereby disswading his Subiects from taking
that most reasonable Oath of Allegeance, and checking the
Arch-priest for taking it: to these his Maiestie in his booke
Intituled Triplici nodo triplex cuneus, or an Apologie for the oth
of Allegeance, vouchsafed with his owne Penne to frame a full
and quicke answere, aswell for the satisfaction of scrupulous
consciences, as for the iustifying of his owne proceedings, to
which the Cardinal vnder the name of Tortus makes his reply,
and hauing on his visarde, dealt with his Maiestie at his pleasure,
in such termes, as neither became a Churchman to giue,
nor a Prince to take: whereupon his Maiestie being nowe
somewhat warmed, once againe tooke his quill in hand, and
wrote that excellent Premonition to the Monarchs and free
States of Christendome (as the Prince of Aurange did his Apologie
to the States of the Netherlands, hauing his head proscribed
by Phillip the second King of Spaine for the summe of
25000. Crownes) wherein hee not onely refutes Bellarmines
reply; but by a large Confession of his Faith cleareth himselfe
from all imputation of Heresie, and with all most iudiciously
setteth downe the reasons of his opinion, why he cannot but
conceaue the Bishop of Rome to be Antichrist: To this the
Cardinall againe reioyneth, somewhat more manerly in shew,
but indeed no whit lesse saucily then in his former discourse,
and how manyChristanouic Pacenius Becan Parsons Coqueus Eudamon Schoppius Reboule Coffeteau Peletier Gretser Suarez Beaumanoir Hell-hounds haue followed vpon the same
sent, the world to well knoweth, besides it is not vnknowen
how some of the plotters, or at leastwise abettors in that intended
Tragedy, haue their Apologies published from Rome, and others
their protection in Rome; nay, the doctrine which gaue
life to that, and giues way to the like attempt, is as violently
maintained by the Romish Doctors, as euer, beside infinite other
writers, witnes Beaumanoirs expostulatory defence of Suarez
against Seruius expository cōplaint, as also Cardinal Perrons,
and his fellow Prelates late proceedings in France, together
with his Holinesse benedictiō for that speciall peece of seruice,
both the Cardinal in his oration, &amp; the Pope in his Letter,

labouring to disgace our Church &amp; State: with what assurance
then can this Maiesty ioyne hands with Rome? since though the
Powder be remoued frō vnder the Parliament house, yet they
still prepare new matter for the like Blow, and no doubt but
Paulus V. would be as ready to make his Oration in Conclaue,
in commendation of it being once acted, as Sixtus Quintus was
in commending that mortall blow giuen Henry the thirde of
France by a Friar Iacobin; which that it may the rather appeare,
I will hereunto annexe the Translation of his Letter to Cardinall
Perron, and the other French Prelates assembled in Parliament,
the Originall it selfe is but a barbarous Papall stile, and
therefore it cannot be expected, but the Translation should be
sutable, the Letter was written vpon occasion of a Bill passed
in the Lower-house, crossing the Popes pretended Power,
in Deposing and Murthering Princes, and crossed by the
Clergie.

wherby some, as we haue heard in the generall
assembly, there held in the 2. of Ian. haue endeuoured
to violate the sacred authority of the
Apostolike See, hath so troubled our minde,
that were we not comforted by the firme confidence
wee haue in the singular pietie and
prudence of our dearest children, King Lewis
and Queene Mary his mother, whom we vnderstand

to haue been carefull to represse so vnaduised
an attempt, and in the admirable zeale
wherewith you being kindled, haue no lesse
constantly and couragiously, then wisely and
religiously withstood so great rashnesse, wee
had been vtterly ouerwhelmed with intolerable
griefe; and indeed this had been a fearefull
token, seeing wee may not without cause suspect,
lest into France haue flowen sparkes of the lamentable
fire of England, to the consuming and
destruction of all true Pietie and Religion in
that most Christian Kingdome, which wee
trust, relying on Gods helpe, shall alwayes
more and more increase vnder the patronage
of so godly a King, trained vp with so great
vigilancie to this end, principally by a most religious,
and truely most Christian mother,
you thereunto diligently yeelding your helpe,
as you alwayes commendably haue done: but
although such hopes doe not a little comfort
vs, yet are wee not for all this free, and voide
of all affliction and trouble: yea, wee are vehemently
anguished, considering with our
selues, in how crosse and stormie a time, wee,
by the secret dispensation of God, vndertooke
the guiding of S. Peters Barke, standing doubtfull

and perplexed, lest happily through our
negligence the sinke of vices increase, and consequently
the nauigation growe more dangerous
and difficult: for this cause wee dayly flie
vnto him, and implore his helpe, who as without
any merit of ours, so also when wee
thought nothing lesse, was pleased we should
sit at the sterne, and guide the helme: whom
wee pray, that while the waues rush against
the Prow, and heapes of foming Sea swell on
each side, and tempest follow in the Sterne,
hee not suffer any wracke, notwithstanding so
violent shaking of the shippe; meane while we
giue the greatest thankes to his infinite goodnesse,
that in the greatest danger which hitherto
happily wee haue been in, hee hath relieued
vs with most seasonable succours; to wit, by
your singular vertue, and prouided for the safetie
of the Kingdome of France, by the counsell,
industry, and religious fortitude of the Ecclesiasticall
order of that Kingdome; and on the
other side wee gratulate you much, and withall
greatly praise you, that your France nowe
beholdeth flourishing againe in you the zeale,
pietie, learning, and magnanimity of her holy
Fathers, Denis, Hilary, Martin, Bernard, and the

rest, whose memorie is blessed for their care of
Gods honour, and the Churches dignity; yea,
and all the holy Church of God may acknowledge
of your company, Cardinals of such eminence,
as become so worthy members of the
holy Apostolike Sea, and Bishops, and Prelats,
and Pastours, who are good seruants, and faithfull,
and truely worthy of their Master, hauing
really shewed, that they loue his glory more
then themselues; true Pastours of the sheepe of
Christ, who for the saluation of their flocke
haue not doubted to lay downe their owne
life, while by shedding of their owne blood,
they haue with so great feruencie of minde
shewed themselues ready to maintaine the fences
of the Lords folde, that is the Churches
Rights: Highly therefore doe wee praise you
and gratulate you againe; for what is more
laudable? what more glorious? then for the
Priests of God, setting aside respect of all humane
commoditie, constantly to haue defended
the dignity of holy Church, and through
zeale of maintaining the Catholike trueth, to
neglect their owne life: As also it is to bee
ascribed to the greatest happinesse that it so fell
out, this noble triall of your Priestly vertue

King Lewis his Progenitour, no lesse reigning
in your King, then the memory of his
glorious name reuiues in him: wherefore wee
doe the more exhort you, that you alwayes
more earnestly persist in your most laudable
enterprise; God verely will perfect the worke
hee hath begun in you; acknowledge his hand
wonderfully moouing the hearts of Kings
which hee holdeth, and with one accord beare
vp against the violence of the raging Sea, stirred
with the storme of humane pride, and the
whirlewind of secular wisedome, seuered from
the feare of God; doubtles the tempests that are
risen, he will allay, who failed not his wauering
disciples; indeed hee suffereth vs to bee
tempted, but giues an issue with the temptation;
therefore bee of good courage, knowing
that the Iudge standeth aboue and beholdeth
the combate of his seruants, to giue vnto euery
one a reward worthy of his labour; and he that
fighteth valiantly, shall be worthily rewarded.
Now we, whose charitie hath been alwayes
great toward you in the Lord, vehemently louing
you, and highly esteeming your excellent
vertue, doe most willingly promise to afford

you whatsoeuer helpe or Comfort in the Lord

bound to you for your so glorious and
admirable exploit, not ceasing in the meane
time daily to pray vnto God the Father of mercies,
that by the increase of his holy grace, hee
would vouchsafe alwayes to keepe and strengthen
you in his holy seruice, and because wee
cannot sufficiently, according to our desire manifest
vnto you by writing this most louing
affection of our heart vnto you, wee haue giuen
in charge to our Venerable Brother, Robert
Bishop of Montpellier our Apostolike Nounce,
that what hee hath receiued in Commission,
touching this businesse, more at large from vs,
hee carefully by word of mouth impart vnto

of the businesse: To him therefore shall yee
giue altogether the same credence, which yee

alwayes your Counsels and endeuours according
to his holy pleasure, and we from the inmost

such loue, such ielousie, is so passionately expressed in the main
businesse, about which his Maiesties personall and publique
quarrell with Rome first beganne, what likelihood is there of
perswading his Maiestie, that no Roman Catholike in the world
can bee his enemie, except first hee bee perswaded that
the Pope of Rome is no Roman Catholike, yet, how farre
hee was mooued to anger, vpon occasion of the Powder-treason
against the body of that profession, his owne wordes deliuered
in the next session of Parliament, after the discouery of
that bloody designe shall testifie, [as for mine owne part (sayth
hee) I would wish with those ancient Philosophers, that there
were a Christall window in my brest, wherein all my people might
see the secretest thoughts of my heart: for then might you all see
no alteration in my mind for this accident, further then in these two
points. The first, caution and warinesse in gouernment, to discouer
and search out the mysteries of this wickednesse, as farre as may be

The other after due triall, seuerity of punishment vpon those that
shall bee found guilty of so detestable and vnheard of a villenie.]
This was the height of his anger, any more then this he declared
not, and lesse then this well he could not. But, before this
(you say in the entrance of this Section, stil harping vpon your
old string.) He was indifferent, wheras your great Cardinall (a
man of no meane intelligence) in his Tortus, makes his Maiesty
to haue bene a Puritane whiles hee was in Scotland, and againe
confirmes the same in his Apologie, for that in the first booke of
his Ba
                           •
                        ilicon Doron, he affirmes that the religiō there professed,
was grounded vpon the plaine words of the Scripture, and againe
(in his second booke) that the re
                        •
                     ormation of religion in
Scotland was extraordinarily wrought by God: And before

the Powder treason, he makes him so farre from indifferencie, as
he faines the seuerity of his lawes against Romane Catholikes,
to haue giuen occasion to that foule conspiracy, and to the
conspirators (being then without all hope) of entring into so
desperate a course. And sure it seemes the Powder-traytours
themselues held him not indifferent; for they discouered greater
anger towards him in the proiecting of that bloody treason,
then he toward them or their associates, after the discouery
of it, which notwithstanding it seemes by Watsons confession
(not long before his execution) the Iesuites were hatching
before his (vndertaken for religion too) was detected; not
full three moneths after his Maiesties right to the Crowne
before it was setled, or so much as set on his head: nay Garnet
himselfe, their Arch-Priest being sollicited, not long before
the Queenes death, by a gentleman of a noble family (but Popishly
affected) that when time serued hee would set forward
the kings title among Catholikes, returned this answere [that
he had nothing to doe with the kings right, or the promoting
it, in as much, as he was so hardened in a religion contrary to
his, that now there was no hope of his conuersion left.]
                  Thus we see that neither the Powder-traitours themselues, nor
Watson and Clerke Priests, nor the Iesuits, nor the Arch-Priest,
nor the Cardinall held him indifferent before the Powder-treason,
yet Mr. Doctor is of a contrary opinion to them all, perswaded
(it may be) by his Maiesties Letters, pretended to be addressed
before his entrance into this kingdome, in the yeere 1598. to
Pope Clement the VIII, Cardinall Aldobrandin, and Cardinall
Bellarmine, that some one of the Scottish nation might bee
created Cardinall, by whose intercourse he might more freely
and safely negotiate with the Pope: this reason indeede I haue
heard some Romane Catholikes much stand vpon; and except
this be it, I cannot conceiue what should moue Mr. Doctour
thus boldly and frequently, to vpbraid his Maiesty with indifferency,
which was the fault of the Angel of the Church of the

erreth about his Maiesties writings; I may (I hope without
breach of charity) suppose that hee neuer so much as read or

saw the fullAd M. Torti lib. Resp. pag. 191 answere to this obiection, long since published to
the view of the world, standing partly vpon his Maiesties peremptory
deniall, of euer yeelding his consent to the sending
of such letters, and giuing the Pope to vnderstand by messages
deliuered by word of mouth, that if hee ha
                        •
                      receiued any letters
at all, as written from him, he should esteeme them none
otherwise, but as counterfeit, or gotten by stealth; partly vpon
the confession of theL. of Balmerinoch then his Maiesties Secretary. party himselfe before his Maiesty, and
the Lords of his Counsell, who, (out of an ambitious desire of
aduancing his neere kinsman to the dignity of a Cardinal,) being
then the Secretary of State, shufled in those letters among
others, when his Maiesty was ready to take horse, and so by
cunning got them to be subscribed; and partly vpon the Popes
proceedings after the receit of them, which was the shewing
of them to such as came thither of the Scottish nation, and demanding
whether they thought the subscription to bee his
Maiesties owne hand, &amp; suffering some to take copies of them;
besides he neither answered the Letters, nor granted the suite
contained in them, and some yeeres after writing to his Maiesty
by Sr. Iames Lindsey, he neither mentioned those letters,
nor blessed his Maiesty with Apostolike benediction; and after
all this, sent his two Breues to the Romane Catholikes here in
England, for the excluding of him from the Crowne. And thus
haue we now not onely the traitours, the secular Priests, the
Iesuits, the Arch-Priest, the Cardinall, but the Pope himselfe,

before the Powder-treason.
                  
                  To conclude this Section then, and therewithall my reply
to such pretended motiues, as might incline his Maiestie
to reconcilement with the Church of Rome, or toleration of
Roman Catholikes, if his Maiestie haue as great reason to continue
seperation with the Church of Rome, as Henry had to
make it, and Queene Elizabeth to maintaine it, and that it
doth increase his lawfull authoritie, both ouer more persons,
and in more causes, if it may serue for the better inriching of
his coffers, an vnion with that Church, can not but bring
both his honour and wisedome into question, being so farre

prouoked without iust occasion giuen, or any satisfaction hitherto
made; and hauing so deepely ingaged himselfe in the
quarrell, if thereby hee shall depriue himselfe of that blessing,
which otherwise he might expect, and hitherto hath felt from
Christ his Sauiour, whose cause hee pleadeth from his Christian
and truely Catholike neighbour Princes states and Subiects;
and lastly, from the Church of CHRIST, in whose communion
is the greatest comfort both in life and death, then
whatsoeuer some discontented fugitiue, or hired aduocate of
Rome, may say to the contrary, I doe verely beleeue they doe
but speake for themselues, and that there is no true reason that
may concerne his Maiesties good, but rather danger and harme,
why hee should admit a publike toleration of Papists and Popish
Religion, who stoppe their eares at home against the charmer,
charme hee neuer so wisely, and abroad with great eagernesse
pursue the ruine of their natiue countrey, among whom I professe
I must hold Mr. Doctor to haue been one, till I be better
informed to the contrary.

                  From his Maiestie that sits at the Sterne, and commands all,
you come to the Subiect, but if it were in the power of Romanists,
I doubt much, whether hee should long sit there, and
how hee commaunds all, well appeares by their refusall to take
those lawfull Oathes, which hee imposeth. Now for the Subiect,
you beginne first with the Lords, and so descend to the
Commons, Concluding lastly with the Clergy, and sing them
seuerally a Syrens song, that so being lulled asleepe the common
ship they are caried in, may dash vpon the Rocke of Rome.

                  For mine owne part, for the discharge of my duetie and conscience,
I haue considered of all there States, and can resolue my selfe
that I haue not preiudiced the State of any good Subiect of yours,
but mine owne, in comming to the Catholike Church. And first,
for your Lords and Nobles, it is true, that many of their an
                        •
                     estors
were allowed a very good share in the diuision of the Church, when
the Shisme began, &amp; therfore it concerned them (in reason of State)
to maintaine the doctrine of diuision, but I thinke there are very
few in England, either Lords or other, now possest of Abbey lands,
which haue not payed well for them, and might aswell possesse them in
the vnitie of the Church as in the Schisme, and there was a declaration
made by the Pope to that purpose in Queene Maries dayes, so
that now there is no neede at all to preach against the merits of good
workes, nor the vertue of the Sacraments, nor the inuocation of
Saints, nor the rest of Popery that built Churches, vnlesse it bee to
helpe the Hugonotes of France to pull them downe.

                  39.
                  Hauing entred into a deepe studie, and serious consideration
of all States, at length you resolue (as from the oracle) that
you haue preiudiced none, in playing the turnecoate, but your
selfe, and sure I am of the same opinion, there being none, as
I hope, so vnwise as to be turned by you. Now in taking this
suruey, you begin with the Lords, who were allowed a very good
share (you would say a great) in the diuision of the Church, yet if
they will bee so good as to side with the Pope, they shall both
enioy their Religion, and keepe their possessions, as now (in
this Religion) they doe, so wee see you would iuggle at fast
and loose, play at small game rather then sit out, and became
all vnto all, that you might winne some, though in another sense,
then S. Paul both meant and practised it. And whereas you
would salue the matter by th
                           •
                        ir paying for those possessions, that
shift will not serue the turne for Queene Maries dayes, when
the greatest part of them were both vnsold and vnbought, otherwise
then in the first sharing. By your opinion, that Abbey
lands may bee aswell possessed in the vnitie of the Church, as in
the Schisme, (as you are pleased to call it) it seemeth you haue
seene the motiues perswading to a dispensation in that behalfe,
collected and reduced into writing in the second yeere of
Queene Maries reigne, the originall of which (amongst other
authentike remembrances of that time) is preserued in
the Office of his Maiesties Papers; which, because I verely
thinke it was the ground of that Declaration made by the Pope
in Queene Maries time, which you speake of, and a prin

pro continuatione possessionis iam acquisitae, propter
tantum bonum publicae concordiae &amp; vnitatis
Ecclesiae, ac praeseruatione istius Status, tam in corpore
quam in anima.
                  
                  
                     THat all such as by iust title according to
the Lawes or Statutes of this Realme
for the time being, haue any possessions,
lands, or tenements lately belonging to Monasteries;
Priories, Bishoprickes, Colledges,
Chanteries, Obites, &amp;c. Whether they haue
purchased thē for their money, or are come to
possesse them by gift, grant, exchange, or by any
other legal meanes whatsoeuer, may retaine
and keepe the same in their possessions, and
haue the same ratified and established vnto
them by the confirmation and dispensation of
the Sea Apostolike.
                     
                        Causes and reasons why such dispensations
may be iustly granted with honour
and conscience.
                     
                     1 The state of the Crowne of this kingdome
cannot be well susteined to gouerne and

rule with honour, if such possessions be taken
from it: for at this day the greatest part of the
possessions of the Crowne consisteth of such
lands and possessions.
                     2 Very many men haue with their moneyes
bought and purchased great portions of
those lands from the most Excellent Kings,
Henry the VIII. and Edward the VI. who by
their Letters Patents haue warranted the same,
of which landes and possessions, if the owners
should now be dispossessed, the King should
be bound to repay vnto them all their money,
which would arise to such a huge masse, that it
would be a hard matter for the Crowne to restore
it.
                     3 The Nobles and Gentry of this realme,
most of whom haue sold and aliened their ancient
inheritances, to buy these new, cannot
liue according to their degrees, if these possessions
should be taken from them.
                     4 The purchasers or owners of such lands
and possessions, in as much as they came to
them by iust title, according to the ordinance
of the Kings of this kingdome, haue held and
doe still hold a good and iustifyable course in
obteining them.
                     
                        5 The enioying of such landes and possessions
is so common vnto euery State and
condition of men, Cities, Colledges, and Incorporations,
that if the same bee taken from
them, there will necessarily follow thereupon
throughout the whole Kingdome a suddaine
change and confusion of all Orders and Degrees.
                     6 Seeing that the goods and possessions of
the Church, euen by the authority of the Cannons,
may bee aliened for the redemption of
captiues, and that the same may bee done by
that Church onely, to whom such possessions
doe belong: It is fit and reasonable that such
dispensations should bee granted for continuing
of possession already gotten, for so great a
good of publike concord and vnity of the
Church, and preseruation of this State, as well
in body as in soule.
                  
                  Those possessions indeed in many places (I speake specially
of Tenths) which by reason of Popish dispensations were
first caried from the Church, are as the fl
                        •
                     sh which the Eagle
stole from the Altar, carying a coale of fire with it, to the burning
down and quite consuming of the nests of many of them
that held them; and in this respect Mr. Doctor may well say,
that the most part of them who now enioy them, haue payed well for
them; in asmuch as the first owners were enforced, or their posteritie
within a generation or two, to sell that which others
purchased. Now this curse of God I can impute to none other

thing then to the alienation of Tenths from their proper vse, to
which they were, and still should be ordained, or at leastwise
the bare and scant allowance which is made to the Minister of
the greatest part of the fattest Impropriations; so that commonly
no Parishes are worse prouided for, then those that pay most,
the redresse wherof, if it should please God to put into his Maiesties
heart, and the assembly of the Estates in parliament, it
would bee a worke no doubt honourable in it selfe, acceptable
to CHRIST, and beneficiall to his Church, for which he would
the rather blesse their other proceedings: I speake not for the
restoring of Impropriations, (though that were rather to be wished
then hoped, their value being little or nothing inferiour
to the Benefices) but the making of a cōpetent allowance out
of them, for the maintenance of a preaching Minister, and I am
sory to heare that some of them should be so backward in the
former, who most vrge the later, the rather for that I would not
haue it thought our Religion cannot stand, but by the spoyle
of the Church liuings, though the Pope (as it seemes by Mr.
Doctor) cares not who loseth so that himselfe may winne.
                  The vertue of the Sacraments expressed in holy Scripture
wee preach not against, but as for merit of workes, and inuocation
of Saints they were preached against, and that in England
long before the lands were taken from the Abbeys; and though
they are still preached against, yet with vs are the Saints reuerenced
with the honour due vnto them, by our obseruation of
the dayes consecrated to the memorials of their glorious and
precious deaths: And some Churches are built among vs as occasion
serues, and necessitie requires; but more Hospitals,
Schooles, almeshouses, Colledges, Libraries, and the like charitable
workes, since the beginning of Queene Elizabeths
reigne to this present time, then in the space of any three score
yeeres successiuely taken since the Conquest, which I speake
not to boast of the fruits of our Religion, but to giue God the
honour; and as for the Hugonotes of France (as you are pleased
to terme them) if they bee guilty of pulling downe Churches,
wee neither incourage them to it, nor defend them in it, as neither
doe wee the Papists in their barbarous massacres, but

onely say of them as the parents of the blind man, they are of
sufficient age, let them answere for themselues.
                  
                  Lastly, because you addresse your discourse in particular
to the Nobles in this Section, I craue leaue to put them in mind
of a peece of a letter written by their predecessors to the Bishop
of Rome, during the reig
                        •
                     e of Henrie the III. I will recite
it in the words of Matthew Parris translated. [The great ones
(sayth hee) by writing to the Pope, complained of the scandals
bred out of the rapine and auarice of Rome, and spread not onely in
England, but through the Christian world, that themselues would
not endure that their countrey from thencefoorth should bee so rudely
handled, no though the King himselfe should winke at it, and
vnlesse (say they) these matters bee speedily redressed by you, let
your Holinesse know for certaine, that it may not vniustly bee feared
that such a danger is likely thereby to ensue, both to the Church of
Rome, and to our Lord the King, that no remedie will easily bee
found for it.] My hope then is, that our Nobles being now farther
enlightned by the beames of the Gospell, and the cleare
discouery of the trueth in the writings of learned men, then
their predecessours, who liued in those times of darkenesse,
will, like the Noble Theophilus, (to whom S. Luke dedicates his
Gospell, and The Actes of the Apostles) and those noble Bereans,
(Acts 17. 10. 
                     who the more noble they were, receiued the word with the greater
readinesse) hold fast the profession which they haue vowed
themselues vnto, by resisting the vsurpation and tyranny of
that man of sinne, and maintaining the libertie and freedome
of their countrey.
                  
                     In the first Parliament held by Queene Mary after her
Comming to the Crowne, the Nobilitie of England, though
they gaue way to the administration of the Sacraments, and other
doctrinall points, as they were vsed and held in her Father
Kings Henries time, yet could they hardly be induced, either
by her importunitie (whom it most concerned, in regard
of her birthright, made good by the Popes dispensation) or by
the perswasions of Cardinall Poole her Cosin, and by her made
Archbishop of Canterbury, who had beene for many yeeres
maintained, (for the most part) at the Popes charge, to yeeld

that the Queene should surrender her title of Supreme head of
the Church of England, or that the Pope should bee suffered
to exercise his wonted iurisdiction within her dominions, how
much more then at this time should they plucke vp their spirits
to the abandoning of that vniust challenge, hauing now a
Soueraigne who in his
                     Defence du Droit des Rois, pag. 111. &amp; 112. 
                     writings last published to the world bearing
the date of this yeere [Consecrates his Scepter, his Sword, his
pen, his endeuours, vnto God, in a thankefull acknowledgment of the
grace bestowed on him, in freeing him from the error of this age,
and his kingdome from the Popes yoke which kept it in thraldome, in
which God is now sincerely serued, and called vpon in a language
vnder stood of all, in which the people may read the Scriptures without
any speciall priuiledge, and with the same freedome, as the people
of Ephesus, of Rome, of Corinth, reade the Epistles written by S.
Paul; in which they pay no more tribute by the Polle, thereby to obtaine
the remission of there sinnes, as they did scarce one hundreth
yeeres yet past, neither are they inforced to seeke their pardons beyond
the Seas, and the mountaines, God himselfe presenting them to
my Subiects (sayeth hee) in there owne Countrey, by the doctrine
of the Gospel; and if in this regard it bee, that the Cardinall termes
the Churches of my Kingdome miserable, for mine owne part 1 esteeme
our misery aboue his happinesse,] since then wee haue (by
Gods prouidence) such a Soueraigne, let that aspersion neuer
be fastened vpon our Nobility, which his Maiesty iustly casteth
vpon the French, that [in as much as they gaue way to the acknowledging
of their King to bee deposable by the Pope, it were fit that
withall they should diuest themselues of their titles, and resigne
them to the third estate, who were the only men that could neither
bee so drawen by promises, nor affrighted by threats, but that they euer
helde them fast to the maintenance of their Kings honour, and
the surety of his person.

                  But perhaps the Commons of England, doe gaine so much by
the Schisme, as they cannot abide to heare of vnity; Indeed when the

Puritan Preacher hath called his flocke about him, and described
the Church of Rome to bee so ignorant, so Idolatrous, and so wicked,
as hee hath made himselfe beleeue shee is, then is hee wont to
Congratulate his poore deceiued audience, that they by the meanes
of such good men as himselfe is, are deliuered from the darkenesse

Schisme:I haue said it before, and I will be bold vpon this occasion giuen, to report it againe, not to boast of it, but to praise God for it, that his Maiesties Dominions afford as many sufficient and learned Preachers, and that in a more substantiall and conscionable fashion, then the Popes Hierarchie, and that London alone affords more then Rome it selfe: and their readinesse to supply Sermons, is not so much out of any good will they beare that exercise, as out of ill will they beare vs. but it was an opinion of wealth and liberty made them
breake at first, and if they doe duely consider of it, they are neuer the
better for either of both, but much the worse.

Puritan historian, and Sauanorola a Puritan Preacher (though
all Italians and most of them well acquainted with the Court
of Rome) which is now come (in a manner) to be all one with
the Church of Rome. The Ignorance of the people is such, that
they adore it as the mother of deuotion, contenting themselues
to beleeue as the Church beleeueth: Of their ordinary

of these corruptions in that Church, and to thanke God for
our deliuerance from them, if not in whole, yet by Gods grace

in some good measure, I confesse my selfe to be a Puritan Preacher,
and thinke no honest minded Minister in England wil refuse
that title tendred vnder those conditions: and if the people
doe not acknowledge this inestimable blessing with
hearty thankefulnesse to God for it, it is to bee feared he will
remoue their Candlesticke, and in his iudgement suffer them
to relapse againe into their former disease.

                  For wealth the Puritan vnthrift that lookes for the ouerthrow
of Bishops and Churches Cathedrall, hopes to haue his share in them
if they would fallonce, and therefore hee cannot chuse but desire to
increase the Schisme, that he may gaine by it: but theSo that in Mr. Doctors Logick an honest Protestant may thus be defined: One that can endure the State of England as it is, and could be content it were as it was, that he might receiue more benefit. honest Protestant
that can endure the State of England as it is, could bee
content it were as it was, for hee should receiue more benefit by it
euery way. The poore Gentleman and Yeoman that are burthened
with many children, may remember, that in Catholike times the
Church would haue receiued, and prouided for many of their sonnes
and daughters, so as themselues might haue liued and died in the
seruice of God without posteritie, and haue helped to maintaine the
rest of their families; which was so great a benefit to the Commonwealth,
both for the exoneration and prouision thereof, as noYou tel vs before that all false religions in the world are but humane policies, and we as truely returne it vpon you, that this humane policie fauours of a false religion. humane
policie can procure the like. The Farmer and Husbandman
(who laboureth to discharge his payments, &amp; hath little or nothing
left at theyeres end to lay vp for his children, that increase &amp; grow
vpon him) may remember, that in Catholike times there were better
penny-worths to bee had, when the Clergie had a great part of
the Land in their hands, who had no neede to raise the Rents
themselues, and did what they could to make other Lords let at
a reasonable rate, which was also an inestimable benefite to the
Commons so that whereas ignorant men carried with enuie against
the Clergie, are wont to obiect the multitude of them, and the greatnesse
of their prouisions, they speake therein as much against themselues
as is possible; for the greater the number is of such men, as be

                     Many of them though they professed themselues dead to ye world yet were they aliue to the flesh. 
                     mundo mortui, the more is the exoneration of the Commons, and
the more the land is of such as can haue no proprietie in them, the
better is the prouision of the Commons; for themselues can haue no
more then their food, and their regular apparell, all the rest either
remaines in the hands of the Tenants, or returnes in hospitalitie and
reliefe to their neighbours, or is kept in a liuing Exchequer for the
seruice of the Prince and Countrey in time of necessitie; so that
the Commons doe gaine no wealth at all, but rather doe lose much by
the Schisme.

                  You proceede, and assure the Commons, that our separation
from Rome, makes much against their wealth and libertie, for
proofe whereof you beginne with the Puritan vnthrift, who
lookes for the ouerthrow of Bishops and Churches Cathedrall, hoping
to haue his share in them. Now I denie not, but some such vnthrifts
there may bee, shrouding themselues vnder the vizard
of those whome you call Puritans, but their power is not so
great (God bee thanked) as wee neede feare them, nor I hope
shall bee whiles his Maiestie and his posterity sway the Scepter,
who is so farre from pulling them downe, or giuing any
way vnto it, that hee hath not onely to his immortall fame,
bound his hands from withdrawing any thing from them, but
restored them in Scotland, and both often and openly professed,
[No Bishop, no King,] and as for them which looke for
that ouerthrow, let their eyes drop out of their sockets, with
looking, and the yong rauens deuoure them.
                  I haue heard of a platforme of our Church gouernment deuised
by Parsons, if the Pope should once againe recouer his
footing amongst vs, in which one especiall piece of his proiect
is, the pulling downe of the Bishopricks &amp; Churches Cathedrall,
that his Holinesse and the Padres may bee all in all,
so that the Iesuites may most properly bee termed those Puritan
vnthrifts: And I make no doubt, but if his Holinesse could

                     dispence with those who withhold the Tenths of the Church, he
might as well dispence with the pulling downe of Bishoprickes and
Cathedrall Churches.
                  
                  Now for those honest Protestants, who for matter of religion
could be content it were as it was, conditionally themselues might
receiue more benefit, their heads may bee in England, but sure
their hearts are in Rome, deceiuing themselues aswell in vndervalewing
the benefit they haue, as in expecting that they haue
not, nor are euer like to haue; the faire pretexts and promises
made them from Rome, being like the Apothecaries boxes, ha

                  The first apple you present the Commons, if they yeeld to the
reentertaining of Popish religion, is increase of wealth: But before
we goe any farther in the triall of this point, I shall desire
all ingenuous Papists, rightly to informe both themselues, and
others, what the two Monkes Matthew Paris, and Matthew of
Westminster haue left vpon record, touching the Bishop of
Romes most intolerable exactions in this kingdome, whiles his
authority here preuailed; and then to iudge indifferently whether
by submitting our neckes to that yoke, which our fathers
were not able to beare, it be likely the wealth of our land should be
increased. That which one of the Popes pronounced touching
our Countrey, was doubtlesse the opinion of them all, I speake
of latter times, [Verè hortus noster deliciarum est Anglia, verè
puteus inexhaustus est, &amp; vbi multa abundant, de multis multa possunt

in the tower of Ousnie Abbey, for feare of a tumult of the

Schollers of Oxford, they termed him Vsurer, Simonist, rentracker,
money-thirster, peruerter of the King, subuerter of the
kingdome, enriching strangers with the spoiles of the English;
but Edmund returning home without successe in his
complaint, and weary of his life in England, by reason that hee
could not redresse the Popes oppressions, made choise of a voluntary
banishment at Pountney in France, where hee died with
the honour and opinion of a Saint.
                  Not long after, his Holinesse desirous to see England, caused
his Cardinals to write their letters to the King, that it would
be a thing tending much to his honour and safety, and to his
kingdomes immortall glory, to enioy the Lord Popes presence,
who did long to view the rarities of Westminster, and the riches
of London, but the Kings Counsell told him plainely [that the
Romane rapines and simonies had enough stained the English puritie,
though the Pope himselfe came not personally to spoile and prey
vpon the wealth of this Church and kingdome.] the like deniall of
entrance hee had found both in France and Arragon, it being
said that [the Pope was like a mouse in a sachell, or a snake in ones
bosome, who but ill repay their hosts for their lodging; and the infamies
of his Court deserued none other, whose filth saith our
Monke [sent foorth a steame and stench, as high as the very
cloudes.]
                  
                  These and worse were the effects of the Bishop of Romes vsurpation
here in England, by imposing continuall taxes and
tallages, being sometimes the tenth, sometimes the fifteenth,
sometimes the third, sometimes the moity of all the goods,
both of the Clergie and Laity, vnder colour of maintaining the
Popes holy warres against the Emperour, and the Greeke
Church, who were then said to bee in rebellion against their
Lady and Mistresse the Church of Rome: Besides for the speedy
leuying and safe returne of these moneyes the Pope had his
Lumbards, and other Italian Bankers and vsurers resident in
London, and other parts of the Realme, who offered to lend
and disburse the moneyes taxed, and returne the same by exchange
to Rome, taking such penall bands (the forme wherof
is set downe in Matthew Paris) and such excessiue vsury, as

the poore religious houses were faine to sell or pawne their
Chalices, and Copes, and the rest of the Clergy and Laity had
their backes bowed, and their estates broken vnder the burden:
besides the Pope tooke for perquisites and casualties, the
goods of all Clerkes that died intestate, the goods of all vsurers,
and all goods giuen to charitable vses. Moreouer he had
a swarme of Friers (the first corrupters of religion in England)
who perswaded the Nobility and Gentry to put on the signe of
the Crosse, and to vow themselues to the holy warres, which
they had no sooner done, but they were againe perswaded to
receiue dispensations of their vowes, and to giue money for
the same to the Church of Rome. I omit diuers other policies
then vsed by the Popes Collectours, to exhaust the wealth of
the Realme, which they affirmed they might take with as good
a conscience, as the Hebrewes tooke the iewels of the Egyptians,
and should we now looke for better measure at his handes?
no, no, he will rather bee ready to demand the principall with
the interest and arrerages, and to bring vs so low as wee shall
neuer be able to cast him againe. Those verses will euer bee
true, though made for those times, and sutable to their barbarisme.

                  It is obseruable which one hath wittily noted, that the first
letters of the words in that sentence, Radix Omnium Malorum
Auaritia, make vp ROMA: And I could wish that for the better
satisfaction of the Commons, to whom this section is directed,
so much of Matthew Paris as concernes this businesse,
might be translated into English; he wrote of the times wherin
he liued, and was for his learned paines much honoured by
the king, being admitted often to his table and chamber.
                  Now, as Mr. Doctours cunning may be obserued, in setting
downe the benefits that arise by Monasteries, and concealing
the Popes extortions, so his forgetfulnesse, in that before hee
cuts off the meanes of the Monasteries, by assuring vs of the
Popes inclination to dispence with those, in whose hands their
reuenues rest; so that this argument of increase of wealth, or

maintenance to the Commons can be of no force, till the owners
of those reuenues be either forced by lawe, or perswaded by
reason to restore them; or others to conferre new, which in
reason will be found more difficult then the former: beside this
argument, if it make for the poore Gentleman and Yeoman, it
makes against the rich Gentleman and Nobleman, whose
landes specially went to the building and maintaining of those
houses: yet the poore Gentleman and Yeoman too, may remember
that whiles the monasteries stood, they were not so much
eased by them of the burden of their children, as burthened
with the keeping of Concubines for the Monkes and Abbots
vse, or else their wiues serued the turne; so that whereas they
were 
                        •
                     ased of one child by the Monastery, they were oftener
burdened with two or three from the Monasterie, and for their
daughters, as by vailing them, and thrusting them into a Nunnery,
they disburdened their hands of them, so by the same
meanes were they often burdened to the shame and griefe of
their Parents, and dishonour of their profession; and yet such
bribes and pensions were there payed for their admission, as
many times they might haue maintained them at home with
lesse charge and more honesty, or if their daughters escaped
free, their sonnes (which was worse) supplied their sisters
roomes, against which grieuous sinne, an acte was made in the
reigne of Henry the first,Renulfus C

Canterbury stopped the publication of it, so that both for lacke
of mariage, it more increased, and for lacke of publication was
it lesse punished.
                  Now for the Common wealth, as their exoneration might
bring some benefit vnto it, so their exemption from the secular
courts of iustice, from the iurisdiction of Bishops, and from
all maner of publique seruice in defence of the State, aswell in
regard of their goods as their persons, could not be but exceeding
preiudiciall: for by that meanes it must needes in time
haue come to passe, that the richest and fattest, nay greatest
part of the land, resting in their hand, the rest of the body politique
must haue starued, but onely by their charity (which
many times was but cold toward the laitie) or the whole haue

lyen open and obnoxious to the inuasion of the forraine enemie,
but onely by their helpe, which was not alway very
ready.
                  Let the Farmer and Husband man remember, that, as better
penny-worthes were to bee had in those dayes, so his vexations
by Excommunications, Interdictions, and Appeales to Rome
were more insufferable, his restraints from labour, whereby he
maintained himselfe and his poore familie by meanes of many
blind holy dayes, now stricken out of the Calender, more frequent;
and lastly his payments greater for Peterpence, for Iubilees,
for oblations, for dispensations, for obits, for touching
of reliques, for Agnus-deis, for hallowing of beads and graines,
for holy water, for masses, for trentals, for dirges, for pardons,
for indulgences, for crusadoes, and a thousand such petty charges,
seruing onely as fewell, aswell to maintaine the luxury of
Monkes and Friars, as to keepe in the fire of Purgatory, which
if it were not by the people conceiued to bee very hote, that in
the Popes and Monkes kitchin would quickly bee very colde:
But to come neere to the point, as better penny-worthes, so in
those times lesse money was also to bee had, all things being
cheaper where is lesse money, and dearer where is more, so that
if the same Monasteries had stood and the same Abbots had
liued in our dayes, I doubt not but they would haue raised
there rents, as our Collegiate Societies haue beene inforced to
doe, or else they must haue pared away somewhat of the superfluitie
of their dishes, which would haue troubled their consciences
more; as well appeared by them who made a lamentable
complaint to the King for want of meate, when three dishes of
thirteene were withdrawen, and of him who hauing his bellie
full stuffed with eating after a great feast, cried out [Quanta
patimur pro amore CHRISTI] And sure it is to me a wonder that
those who both can and often will tell the most merrie iests
of Monkes, and Nunnes, and Friars, yet they of all others most
earnestly desire the restitution of them.

                      Lastly the Commons cannot but remember, that though
they were somewhat holpen by the rich Abbeys, yet were
they as much burthened with the poore Frieries, who had nothing

to helpe them but the deuotion of the people, it being
commonly sayed of their assisting at Funerals, Vbi cadauer, ib

multitude of such Clergy men and the greatnesse of their prouision

Venetians in the last quarrell betweene them and the Pope, if
their goods and persons be still (as they haue beene hitherto)
exempt from Secular iurisdiction and publique seruice of the
state, for the preuention of which mischiefe, was the statute of
Mortmaine for the lessening of these mundo mortui, made by
Edward the first, and confirmed by all his successours, so that
vpon due and trew examination, the Commons are found to
loose nothing, but rather gaine much by the reformation of the
Church, and separation from Rome, and if they did not, yet
were it a poore bargaine for a man to winne the whole world
and loose his owne soule.

                  And as for liberty they are indeed freed from the possibilitie of
going to shrift, that is of confessing their sinnes to God in the eare of
a Catholike Priest and receiuing comfort and counsell against their
sinnes from God by the mouth of the same priest, which duty is required
of Catholike people, but onely once in the yeere, but performed by
them with great comfort and edification very often, so that a man
may see and wonder to see, manyIndeede by the forme of words yet extant in the masse booke and vsed by the Priest, it is supposed that a number should Communicate daily with him but it seldome is so. hundred at one altar to Communicate

to vse it; and what is the liberty that they haue in stead therof? Surely
the seruants haue great liberty against their masters by this
meanes, and the children against their parents and the people against
their prelats, and the subiects against their King, and all against the
Church of Christ, that is, against their owne good and the common
saluation; forIf wee had no vse of confessours, yet might and ought inferiors be kept in awe of hell fire by their Preachers, and superiours be tolde of their errours in state by their Counsellers, but you seeme to assure his Maiestie that if hee will not be told of his errours in confession, he shall in rebellion. without the vse of this Sacrament, neither can
inferiours bee kept in awe, but by the gallowes, which will not saue

rebellion which will not bring them to heauen: These and such like

God hauing prouided so ready a meanes to be rid of it, when

and vomite that they may drinke againe: yea, I haue
knowen of those that caried shew of very deuout persons,
who by their owne report, to excuse their acquaintance in
matters criminall, haue wilfully periured themselues in iudgement,
onely presuming of this present and easie remedie in
Confession; and others of more ordinary note amongst them,
when the time of confessing was at hand, would then venture
vpon those actions which before they trembled at, as presuming
to surfet and surcharge their stomacks by reason of the
neighbourhood of the phisitian, which phisitian also himselfe
is perhaps more apparently infected with the noysome disease
his patient discloseth, then the patient, who is not any way
bettered by the counsell which the Phisitian giueth: but this
must be granted to bee the fault of the people, yet a generall
fault it is, and current without controllement, howbeit the
Priests are no more excusable on their parts, then the people,
telling the penitent that God is mercifull, and whatsoeuer
sinnes he committeth, so long as hee doth penance, and is no
Lutherane, there is good remedy for him, and for their penance,
it consisteth ordinarily but in Aue Maries and Pater
nosters, with Almes deedes, by those that are able, and fastings
by them that are willing; yea, I haue knowen when the penance
for horrible and open blasphemy, besides much other
lewdnesse, hath bene none other then saying of their Beades
thrice ouer, a matter of some houres muttering, and which in
Italy they dispatch also as they goe in the streets, or ride on the
way, or doe their busines at home, making none other of it,
then as it is indeed, two lips and one fingers worke; but were
the penance by the Priests inioyned, neuer so hard and sharpe,
the Popes plenary pardons sweepe all away at a blow.
                  Now whether seruants be not with them vnfaithfull to their
masters, children disobedient to their parents, people vndutifull
to their Prelates, Subiects disloyall to their Soueraignes, aswell
as with vs, I leaue it to them to iudge, who haue had experience
of both. Did not Clement and Rauilliac, and the Powder-traytours
vse Confession? and those villaines who assaulted the

Prince of Aurange, the one sorely wounding, &amp; the other murdering
him? and did not their confessions serue to harden them
in their damnable resolutions?
                  
                     Lastly, for the seale of Confession, without which (you say) it
is impossible to vse the thing it selfe, wee hold it being rightly limited,
a lawfull, yet an humane constitution, as neither in
trueth is particular confession it selfe to men any other; and he
that will not forbeare in conscience and common honesty to
disclose a secret reuealed in such manner, will hardly forbeare
for feare of punishment; and sure I am of opinion, better no
seale to at all, then such a concealement imposed, as is by the
factours of the Romish Church maintained, and was not onely
preached by Garnet, but in him commended by Eudaemon and
Bellarmine, and in others by his example, bee the issue thereof
neuer so deuilish, or toward the king and kingdome neuer so

this the same Mr. Casaubon confesseth, and not onely for himselfe
but for vs, speaking in the plurall number in the Page
immediatly going before, that it was [an ancient decree of the
Church, full of pietie and wisedome, that it should not bee lawfull to
the Confessor, to publish that which he heard in confession, but none
(saith hee) of those holy Fathers, euer decreed that constitution
of Ecclesiasticall discipline, with such strictnesse, as thereby to make
the Law of God of none effect: They knew well enough that if the
case so stood, as the Law of the Church enioyned silence, and the
law of God vtterance, wee should rather obey God, then man: They
knew well enough that Dauid is commended of the Sonne of God,
to whom properly belongs the interpretation of the lawe, himselfe
being the author of it, for the eating of the Shew-bread, which otherwise
was not lawfull, saith Christ, for him to eate, rather then hee
would suffer himselfe to starue with hunger.] To like effect is
that which my Lord of Ely hath in his last booke against Bellarmine,
[Pag. 326. Let that reuerence which is due to that seale, be preserued
inuiolate, but towards penitents, not wilfull proceeders in thier
mischieuous plots, neither is that (saith hee) the seale of God and

are masked. But will Mr. Doctor say these are but the opinions

so much in forbearance of Confession rightly vsed, as in that
libertie wherewith CHRIST hath made them free, (Gal. 5. 1. for if the
sonne haue made them free, then are they free indeed) if they intangle
not themselues againe with the yoke of bondage: &amp; my counsell
is that which the Apostle there aduiseth, Stand fast, and to like
effect, though in another place and case, Art thou free? seeke not
to bee bound: and, as many as walke according to this rule, peace

that would faine fetch the antiquity of his Common Law, from the
Saxons that were before King Ethelbert: So that whether wee
respect the spirituall instruction and comfort, or the temporall wealth
and libertie of the Commons of England, if the Puritan Preacher,
and the Puritan Lawyer, who both seeke the ouerthrowe of the
Church, and deceiue and consume the people, would let them alone,
there would quickely appeare no reason of their state at all why they
should hate the Catholike Church that is so comfortable and beneficiall
vnto them▪ or maintaine the Schisme, that with sugred speaches,
and counterfeit faces, doth so much abuse them.

                  The next priuiledge which you pretend to the Commons,

is the liberty of making Lawes in Church-matters, as if they
could make lawes without the consent of the Lords both Spirituall
and Temporall, or they all without the royall assent of
his Maiestie; and for the multitude of Statutes, which you
speake of, the multitude of erroneous opinions, &amp; deuilish practises
from Rome, haue caused a great part of them, and the malice
both of the deuil (as knowing his time to be but short) and
of men in this last and worst age of the world generally increasing,
must needes giue occasion to more lawes: Hee that shall
looke into the bodie of the ciuill law, may find that those lawes
multiplied faster from Constantines time, to the ende of Iustinians,
which was about 200. yeere, then in foure (nay in fiue)
hundred yeeres before, though the one were vnder a Christian
gouernement, and the other vnder an heathenish, wh

tooke their beginnings, as wee knowe, onely from the lawes
of the twelue tables, which were brought out of Greece. Did
not God himselfe, besides those twelue precepts (grounded
vpon the law of nature) adde many lawes therunto for the gouernement
of his Church? and that which hee did by the Ministry
of Moses, vnto that speciall people, the same power hath
hee left to the gouernours of particular Churches, conditionally
all their lawes bee conformable, or at leastwise not repugnant
vnto his law, the rule and square of all humane lawes:
how hath the Canon law it selfe (to which Mr. Doctors drift is
wholly to resubmit vs in Church gouernement) growen vp to
a great bulke and massie bodie? and how hath their multitude
intangled the Christian world? yet must no man dare open his
mouth to complaine of that. We reade of Luther, that when he
heard his books by publike order were burnt in Rome, he as solemnely
burnt the Canon law at Wittenberge: We haue not proceeded,
neither thinke wee it fit to proceed so farre, but haue
rather chosen out of that dunghill to seeke for a pearle, which
hauing found, we are content to keepe, and as occasion serues
to make vse of: We haue not wholly abrogated the Canon law,
but wee retaine it in part, though not as receiuing strength
from the Popes authoritie, (who for any thing I know, hath no
more right of making lawes for vs, then wee haue for him) but

from the gouernours of our owne Church: Neither did the

                  Now if they refuse one part, they might (in my iudgement)
by the same reason (if they found it inconuenient or
disagreeable) reiect the whole, and I thinke they would not
stand much, if occasion serued vpon the casting off of the Canon
lawe, who could by no meanes yet bee induced to the receiuing
of the Canons of the Council of Trent. A notable instance
hereof wee haue, euen in the depth of Popery, in our
owne Countrey: At the Parliament of Merton, it was proposed,
that children borne before marriage, might bee adiudged
legitimate, according to the rule and practise of the Canon law:
They all made answere with one voice, Nolumus Leges Angliae
mutari, we wil not yeeld to the change of the lawes of England,
by which it appeares that they receiued not in those very times
all the Popes Canons as lawes, and those which they receiued,
they had not the force of lawes, because the Pope imposed thē,
but because themselues entertained them in that nature, and
to that purpose ratified them. Mr. Doctor need not marueile
then if our Parliament now make lawes to the same purpose; and
by the same authority, as they ratified those: The Summons
of Parliament euer since the time of King Henry the V. (and
how long before I know not) haue in one constant forme
and tenour made mention, that the Parliament is summoned
to consult [de negotijs statum, &amp; defensionem Regni Angliae, &amp;

State and defence of the Realme, and Church of England.] Among
other Kings S. Edward begins his lawes with this protestation

much strife, and consequently of many suites and controuersies;
no marueile then if by our increase of people (other trades
and professions increasing) Lawyers should doe the like.
                  But if the Canons of the Church and the Courts of Confession,
were (you say) in request, the Lawyers market would soone bee
marred, what say you then to those Countreys, where both
these are in request, and yet doe their Lawyers both encrease

them to make their owne apologie, only thus much I say, that
the whole body of a profession is not to bee charged with the
fault of some fewe, specially being imputed by those who
desire most to fish in our troubled waters, to warme their
handes at the fire of our contentions, and to rippe vp our

that would fetch the antiquity of the Lawe from the Saxons,
that were before King Ethelbert, herein you make that famous
Iudge before named, whom in his time they esteemed a Father
of the Law, and a learned antiquarie, a Petty-fogging Lawyer,
in as much as in his Book aboue mentioned, he thus speaketh:
[Cap. 17. The realme of England was first inhabited by the Britanes; next
after them the Romanes had the rule of the land; and then againe
the Britanes possessed it; after whom the Saxons inuaded it, and
changing the name thereof, did for Britaine call it England; after
them for a certaine time the Danes had the dominion of the realme,
and then the Saxons againe; but last of all the Normans subdued
it, whose descent continueth in the gouernment of the Kingdome at
this present; and in all the times of these seueral Nations and of their
Kings, this realme was still ruled with the selfe same customes that
now it is, which if they had not bene right good, some of those Kings,
mooued either with pride, or with reason, or affection, would haue
changed them, or altogether abolished them, and specially the Romans
who did iudge all the rest of the world by their owne Lawes;
likewise would other of the foresayed Kings haue done, who by the
sword only possessing the realme of England, might with the same
power haue extinguished the Lawes thereof; and touching the antiquitie
of thesame, neither are the Romane ciuil Lawes, by so long
continuance of ancient times confirmed, nor yet the Lawes of the
Venetians, which aboue all other are reported to be of most antiquitie,
for as much as there Iland in the beginning of the Britanes was
not then inhabited, as Rome it selfe was then also vnbuilded; neither
are the Lawes of any which worshipped God so ancient; wherefore
the contrary is not to bee sayd nor thought, but that the English
Customes are very good, yea of all other the very best] neither can
I conceiue any other reason Mr. Doctor hath, thus bitterly to
enuie against our Lawes, as if they came from the Court infidel,
and were a burthen to the Common wealth, but because some
of them are bent against the Popes vsurpation, and the admission

                           •
                         of Soueraigntie, so is the
Common Law so fauourable and aduantageous in extending
the Prerogatiue of the King, as his Maiestie professeth, [For
a King of England to despise the Common lawe, is to neglect his
owne Crowne:] and a little after protesteth, that [if it were in
his hand to chuse a new law for this Kingdome, hee would not onely
preferre it before any other nationall lawe, but euen before the
very iudiciall law of Moyses.]
                  So that whether wee expect Spirituall instruction and
comfort, or the semporall wealth and libertie of the Commons
of England, (if the Iesuite and Seminarie Priest who
both seeke the ouerthrow of our Church, and deceiue and
consume the people, would let them alone) there would
quickly appeare no reason of State at all, why they should
desire reconciliation to Rome, (which with sugred speaches,
and counterfeit faces, doth so much abuse them) or loathe
the reformation which is euery way so comfortable and beneficiall
vnto them.

the Catholike Church, beside the satisfying, and sauing of mine
owne soule, I shall doe no ill seruice to your Maiestie, neither in
respect of your selfe nor your children, nor in respect of your Lords

it is but folly for any State to maintaine more: For if God haue predestinated
a certaine number to bee saued without any condition at

therein by good workes: If God hath reprobated the greatest
part of the world without any respect at all of their infidelity, heresie,
or wicked life: if the faith of CHRIST be nothing else but the assured
perswasion of a mans owne predestination to glory by him: if
the Sacraments of the Church bee nothing but signes and badges of
that grace which a man hath before, by the carnall couenant of his

to, if they will, where occasion serues: If the study and knowledge of

the rest (malice and preiudice set aside) they might suffer, as
fauourable a construction in Caluin, as in Saint Augustin, or in
Bellarmine, and other Iesuits and schoolemen, neither is all that
Caluin hath written, without exception maintained, by those
in England, who otherwise imbrace and reuerence his paines,
as of a chiefe Captaine in the Lords battailes: your positions
I will examine as they lie in order, whereof the first is.
                  
                     [That God hath predestinated a certaine number to bee saued,
without any condition at all of their being in the visible Church by
faith, or their perseuering therein by good workes.] To which I
answere, that if wee consider Predestination before the fall, it
can haue no reference, to Faith or good workes, flowing from
thence, in as much as if Adam had stood in his originall integritie,
wee should not haue needed the comming of CHRIST
for our saluation, and consequently, neither faith in him, nor
those workes which are the necessarie fruits and effects of that
faith; but if after the fall, then are they both required, not as impulsiue
and meritorious causes, but as markes and effects infallible
of our Predestination, and withall, as the ordinary conditions,
and meanes of our saluation: This I take to bee Caluins
opinion, in the third booke and 22. chap. of his Institutions,
and not Caluins onely, but Martyrs in his Commentary on the
8th. to the Romanes, and Zanchies in his 5. booke of the nature
of God, and second chapter, and Bezaes, in the acts of the
conference at Montpelgard, and generally of our owne Writers
that haue touched this point, and if wee erre herein, wee
erre with St. Augustine, who in his 87. tract vpon Iohn, thus
speaks▪ [Hic certe vacillat eorū ratiocinatio, qui praescientiam Dei
defendunt contra gratiā Dei▪ &amp; ideo dicunt nos electos ante mundi
constitutionem, quia praesciuit nos Deus futuros bonos, non seipsum
nos facturū bonos: Non hoc dicit qui dicit, non vos me elegistis, quoniam

Heere falleth to the ground, their vaine manner of reasoning,
who defend the foresight of God, against the grace of God,
affirming that wee were therefore chosen before the foundation
of the world, because God foresaw wee would bee good,
not that himselfe would make vs good: But hee sayes not so,
who sayes [you haue not chosen mee] for had hee chosen vs, because
hee foresaw wee would bee good, hee should also haue
foreseene, that we would first haue chosen him] To the same
purpose doth hee speake, in the 98. Chapter of his Manuel to
Laurence, and in his 105. Epistle; neither doeth the Master of

Iacob, because hee knew hee would beleeue on him and serue
him, which Saint Augustin in his Retractions confesseth, that

is not Caluins opinion alone, neither was he the first broacher
of it; And to say that hee predestinated a certaine number,
without any condition of Faith and workes, as the markes and
effects of our Predestination, and the means of our saluation, is
not Caluins opinion at all, but thrust vpon him by Mr. Doctor.

                     He hath chosen vs (sayeth the Apostle) before the foundation of
the world, that wee should bee holy, making holinesse the finall,
but not the efficient cause, with which distinction doeth Sixtus
Senensis shut vp the matter in the sixthAnnot. 251. Booke of his
Library, where hauing at large alleaged the sayings of Origen,
Chrysostome, Ambrose, Hierome, &amp;c. who seeme to hold,
that the Prescience of workes is the cause of diuine Predestination,
[quae quidem sententia (sayeth he) in Pelagio damnata est,
which opinion was cōdemned in Pelagius] he addeth that Augustin,
                     
hauing sometime held the same, vpon better aduice, retracted
it almost in innumerable places, and at length concluds,
[Ne
                           •
                         dubium est, &amp;c. Neither is there any doubt to bee made,
but that some of those foresayd Fathers, in pronouncing our
workes foreseene to bee the cause of Gods Predestination, vnderstood
it of the finall cause, and not of the meritorious.]
                  The second point which you call Caluini
                        •
                     me, is▪ that [God
hath Reprobated the greatest part of the world without any respect
at all of their infidelitie, heresie, or wicked life;] to which I answere,
that this point of Doctrine being rightly vnderstood, is
not Caluins alone▪ but Martyrs, Zanchies, Bezaes, in the places
before alleaged, and generally of our owne diuines; nay of

is Gods will of not sauing men, the positiue his will of
damning men. [of the former of these (sayeth hee) no cause
can bee assigned, in regard of vs, as neither of our Predestination,
but of the lattter, the cause is the foresight of sinne] Now
the former of these two acts is that, by which men are properly
sayd to bee reprobated, as by the latter to bee damned,
so that to say, God hath reprobated the greatest part of the
world, without respect of any thing in themselues, is no more

is to exclude them from Eternall life; and this opinion hee ascribes

man for it, putting him in minde, that it was ipsissima B. Augustini

teacheth.
                  The third point which you call Caluinisme is, that [faith is
nothing else, but the assured perswasion of a mans owne Predestination
to glory by Christ] which differs not much in words, and
in sense very little, or not at all, (as I conce

of the promises of God, applying them to your soule, and
therefore may it iustly bee termed(saith hee) the Golden chaine
that linketh the faithfull soule to CHRIST: But I wonder what
Mr. Doctor meant, in saying, that Caluin maketh it nothing else,
whereas the Church of Rome maketh it not by many degrees
so much; it beeing in their doctrine a naked and bare apprehension
of, and assent vnto supernaturall trueths, in which the
deuill himselfe may goe as farre as any, nay, doeth goe farther
then many of them; for in that sort hee bothIam. 2. 19.

                     is the ground of things which are hoped for, and
the euidence of things which are not seene: now what is that
grounded euidence, but an assured perswasion? and what are
those things hoped for, and not seene, but chiefly the glory
to which through CHRIST wee are predestinate? so that you
may as well put a nothing else vpon S. Pauls definition, as vpon
Caluins, and yet isInst it.

                         7. 
                     Caluins somewhat more then you make it,
in as much as thereby the fauour of God is not onely apprehended,
but sealed vnto the heart; whereas your faith is of
that nature, as it neither hath any sound foundation to build
vpon, neither is a man certaine when he hath it; neither if hee
haue it, how long hee shall keepe it; neither if hee keepe it,
whether at last it will serue for his iustification in the sight of
God; So that a nothing else may rather be pind vpon the sleeue
of that faith which the Church of Rome teaches, then that
which Caluin defines.
                  The fourth point which you call Caluinisme is, that [the Sacraments
of the Church, are nothing but signes and badges of that
grace, which a man hath before by the carnal couenant of his parents
faith] whereasSee the 4. booke 14. chap. of his Institut. 
                     Caluin in many places, and expresse tearmes,
directly denies, the Sacraments to be nothing else but bare signes,
they beeing in his doctrine, not onely signes to represent that
which they are ordained to signifie, but seales to confirme
that which they represent, and withall, pipes to conuey, or
instruments to present that to the soule of the worthy receiuer,

which they represent to the sence: much lesse then doe
either hee or wee make the Sacraments signes onely of that grace
which the receiuer hath by couenant of his parents faith, as Mr.
Doctor would haue it, for then would it follow▪ that they
should not at all bee Sacraments vnto them▪ whose parents either
are, or died Infidels, though themselues bee conuerted to
Christian Religion; and whereas hee calls that a carnall Couenant,
which God made with Abraham and his seed, it argues
a carnall minded man, sauou
                        •
                     ing those things which are of the
Flesh, and not of the Spirit.
                  The fift point which Mr. Doctor calls Caluinisme is, that
[Priesthood can doe nothing but preach the word, (as they call it)
which Lay-men must iudge of, and may preach too, if they will, where
occasion serues] as if hee were ignorant, that both by Caluin,
and by vs, p
                        •
                     blike prayer, in the name, and for the good of the
people, is specially committed to the Priesthood, and to it onely
is the power of binding and loosing, and of administring
the Sacraments annexed, whereas in their doctrine, it is permitted
not onely to Lay-men, but to women, in some cases:
But with vs (you say) Lay-men must iudge of that which is preached,
and may themselues preach too; whereas the trueth is, that
wee allow them a iudgement, of examination onely, or triall,
which1. Cor. 11. 13, 28. 
                     S. Paul allowed his auditors, and1. I

or determination, which you seeme to implie; and for
their preaching, both our, and Caluins rule is, that no man with
vs taketh, or should take this honour to himselfe, but he which
is called, as wasH

him with gifts, and a disposition thereunto; and outwardly
by the Constitutions and ordinances of the Church.
                  The sixth and last point which Mr. Doctor calls Caluinisme
is, that [the studie, and knowledge of antiquitie, vniuersalitie, and
consent, is not necessary, but euery man may expound Scripture as his
owne spirit shall mooue him] where first I cannot but wonder, that
Mr. Dr
                     ▪, who vrgeth neither antiquity, vniuersality, nor consent
through his whole discourse, should here at last cast, stand so
much vpon them, yet I am perswaded, it was rather to beare
vs in hand, that himselfe was deepely studied in them, then

that hee thought they could much aduantage his cause; neither
is the studie and knowledge of them so neglected, by
those whom Master Doctor, (if hee were liuing) would call
Caluinists, that they feare, euen by that triall, to encounter
the stoutest Champions of the Church of Rome: For leauing
Caluins frequent quotation of the ancient Councils and Fathers,
let the workes of Martyr, of Bucer, of Zanchius, of Iunius,
of Sadeel, of Chamier, of the Noble Du Plessis, and D

Moulin testifie, what account they make of the vniuersall consent,
and of Antiquitie: And for our owne here at home, he that
shall looke into the writings of Bishop Iewel, of Raynolds, of
Whitakers, of Fulke, of Humphreys, of Perkins, (I spare to
name the liuing, nothing inferiour herein to the dead) may easily
finde, if hee shut not his eyes against the light, that they
spared neither cost nor paines in this kinde. To what

i
                        •
                      wee made that slight reckoning of the studie and knowledge
of Antiquitie, as Mr. Doctor would make the world beleeue?
indeed wee cannot but acknowledge that to bee true,
(which trueth it selfe hath deliuered) onething is necessary, and
that many care, and are cumbred about other things more
then about this, yet withall wee as freely confesse that many
things are requisite, some in one degree, and some in another,
to the better compassing of that one, which is onely and absolutely
necessary in it selfe.
                  But e
                           •
                        ery man, you say, with vs, may expound Scripture, as his
owne spirit shall mooue him, whereas wee euery where teach
with S. Peter, that as [2. P

                     noe prophecie-in the Scripture is of priuate
motion.] so neither is it of priuate interpretation; the originall
word signifies both: Wee cannot take from any Christian
man, in expoūding of Scripture, a iudgement of discretion,

in weighing the drift of the Text, and conferring it with other
passages of like nature, though to the guides of the Church and
Pastours of mens soules, we reserue the iudgement of direction;
but the iudgement of iurisdiction to the representatiue
Church it selfe, assembled in Synode: for as the spirits of the
people are in this case subiect to the Prophets, who sit in Moses
chaire, so1 Cor. 14. 32, 33. 
                     the spirits of the Prophets, are subiect to the Prophets,
if not to conuince the conscience, at leastwise to
impose silence; for God is not the authour of confusion, but
of peace; and they which thinke otherwise, for mine owne
part, I thinke of them, that [the way of peace they haue not
knowen.]
                  
                  
                     I will conclude this point with his Maiesties most graue
and godly aduice, [Basil. D

as yee vnderstand not, blaming onely your owne capacitie; reade
with delight the plaine places, and studie carefully to vnderstand

                     euer the best interpreter of it selfe; but presse
not curiously to seeke out farther then is contained therein, for that

Gods secrets, then hee hath will bee; for what hee thought
needefull for vs to know, that hath hee reuealed there; and delight

Genealogies, and contentions which are but vaine and profit not, as
Paul saith.]
                  If these then bee the opinions of the Church of England
(which you call Caluinisme) maintained aswell by the pens, as
the tongues of those Church-men, who sit at the Sterne, and
in the most eminent places of the Church, there will easily appeare,
a reason to the Parliament, if it be demanded, why so necessary
a partie as the Clergie should, at leastwise peaceably enioy that
allowance which they haue allotted, by Gods ordinance, the
piety of deuout mindes, and the ancient constitutions of the
Realme; and sure wee are, that a great deale lesse reason there is
of maintaining so chargeable a Clergie in the Romane Hierarchie,

where the Popes plenary Indulgence may in a trice effectuate
that, about which they make so much a doe.
                  But at length the Asses eares appeare through the Lions
skinne: before he haue told vs in generall that those opinions
(forged for the most part out of his owne braine,) were too much

at length to open his splene, &amp; tels vs in plaine termes, that the
Clergie men he meanes, are such who can be content to be Lords
and to go in Rochets, being indeed the greatest enemies of the Clergie:
now had the same men (who long since did smell his hypocrisie,
and inclination toward Rome) fauoured Dr. Cariers
Popish doctrine, and designes, or endeuoured to haue put him
in a Rochet, and to haue made him a Lord, (whereof he thought
himselfe worthy, though no man else did,) they had doubtlesse
bene in his account the Clergies best friends: but for that
they discouered and discountenanced his slie purposes and
practises, they are now become the greatest enemies the Clergie
hath; they are therefore become enemies, because they tell the
trueth; yet whatsoeuer they are to the Clergie, whome they
loue and tender as their brethren, sure I am they haue proued
themselues more loyall to his Maiestie, and more faithfull to
the State, more diligent in their calling, and more vnblameable
in their wayes, then the accuser, it being a thing full of commiseration
and compassion to see, that by these false and wicked
suggestions of mutinous and discontented persons, the deuil,
the father of these and all other lies, doth daily take possession
of the soules of some of his Maiesties subiects, both of the Nobles
and Commons.
                  
                     But another sort of Clergie men (you say) there are, good schollers
and temperate men, who cannot but in their iudgment approue
the trueth of the Catholike religion: These, that you may the better
satisfie, you desire two things, and by way of counterchange

                  From your demands, you come to your promises, whereof
the first is, that the Pope for his part would confir
                           •
                        e the interest
of all those that haue present possession, in any ecclesisticall liuing in
England: he must then confirme the interest of all those, whom
you call Puritans, and Caluinists, as well as others, which I
thinke hee will bee as vnwilling to doe, as they to take it from
him; nay I am perswaded, there is no Clergy man in England,
worthy the name and credit of a good Subiect, or the profit
of the liuing he holdes, who would thinke the possession of it
any way the securer, for the Popes confirmation: But to grant,
that the right of those, who haue the present interest in them,
might by that means bee strengthened, what were like to become
of the fattest Benefices, and best dignities of our Church
(the same power continuing) in the next age, wee may in
part coniecture, by the experience of former times, they being
by the Popes authoritie conferred vpon his fauourits, Italians
and strangers, who neuer came so much as to see them, and
yet notwithstanding, was the rest of the Clergy so harrowed,
partly by the cunning practise, and partly by the violent extortion
of his Legats, and Collectours, (as I haue already
shewed) that it is surely a lamentable thing to read it, much
more to feele it.

hath of late better studied that Scripture of Saint Paul, the 1. to
the Corinthians, and the 14. then which I see not what can be
more cleerely spoken, not onely for reading and expounding
the Scriptures, but specially for praying in a knowen language;
and if his Holinesse iudge it no offence to God, to permit the
vse of our Liturgy in English, what reason can our Recusants
pretend of their refusall to ioyne with our Congregation in
the vse of it, except his purpose bee to permit it only for an
interim, as Charles the 5th. did to the Germans, vntill hee can
gaine further strength to worke his owne ends, or as hee doth
the stews, to auoide a greater conceiued mischiefe; but (God

any satisfaction but all the honour, that with the vnity of the Church,

                     the vnitie of the Church, and the safety of Catholike religion extends
it selfe, is so doubtfull a case, as none can determine it
but the Pope himselfe, so that except his Maiestie can define, or
diuine rather, what that meanes, hee shall bee as farre to seeke
of his securitie as euer: Hee hath alreadie declared by his
Breues, that the taking of the Oath of Allegeance, cannot stand
with the safety of Catholike Religion, so that if hee will secure
his Maiestie, hee must not only condemne those Authors, and
damne that Doctrine, which teaches his power in deposing
Kings, and disposing of Kingdomes, but hee must either recall
that declaration, made as hee pretendeth, vpon long and
weightie deliberation, (which it may bee to 
                        •
                     erue his turne,
hee would as willingly doe, as absolue the Venetians, though
they no way submitted themselues in the point controuersed)
or if hee persist in the maintenance thereof, as in greatest
likelihood hee w
                        ••
                     l, I see not which way hee can secure his

Maiestie, except hee may bee said to secure, who cuts off all
meanes of his securitie, an oath being among all Christians,
and Heathens, if they bee but morally honest (as the Apostle
speakes) an end of all strife. It is the last resolution in the search
of truth, and in the body politique, the strongest sinew, next
the bound of nature and conscience, wherby the members are
tyed to the head, and the head againe to the members, and the
members knit among themselues: for the Pope then to promise
his Maiesty security, and yet by this meanes to withdraw the
hearts of his Subiects from their naturall allegeance, is, as if a
man should promise secure passage ouer a Riuer, and yet pull
downe the bridge, or take away the boats which serue for that
passage. His Maiestie on the other side, hath declared the Pope
to be Antichrist, in his opinion, and can hee expect honour or securitie
from Antichrist, who hath hitherto depended on none
but CHRIST? he may also be pleased to remember what securitie
the two last Henries of France receiued from him: Lastly
if the Powder-treason were vndertaken without the Popes priuitie,
how can hee secure his Maiestie from the like? except hee
can diue into the secrets of mens harts, or haue the art to foresee
things to come, or to charme the deuils in hell: God defend
vs from such securitie, which hath the face of a man, but the
teeth of a Lyon, which first lulles vs asleepe, and then driues a
naile into our heads.
                  My conclusion of this point shall bee, that common
speech of the Italians themselues, [Acibo bis cocto, a medico
indocto, a vento percolato, &amp; inimico reconciliato, liberanos Domine]
from such honour, as is expected from a Romish reconciled
enemie, Good Lord deliuer vs; so that wee are verily
perswaded, by yeelding your necke to the yoke of Rome, and
perswading his Maiestie and his Subiects to doe the like, you
haue disclosed your hypocrisie, violated your oath, disgraced
your nation, stained your profession, forsaken your
duetie to your Soueraigne, your respect to his Nobles, and
loue to his Commons and Clergy; and not onely so, but aswell
by your example as exhortations, endeuoured what in

you lay, by wounding euery particular member, vtterly to
ruine the whole body both of Church and Common-wealth,

the seruice of God, and the sauing of my soule in the vnitie of that
Church, which was founded by Christ himselfe, and shall continue

is indeed the true Catholike, but not the Rom. Church, it being
founded by Christ before his Comming in the flesh, and shall
continue vntill his comming againe, but not as tied to any certaine
place: in it all the Saints of God serued him on earth, as the Patriarches,
and Prophets, who liued, some of them before the
foundation of Rome: without it there is no Communion of Saints,
no forgiuenesse of sinnes, no resurection vnto life euerlasting, which
no doubt by Gods mercies, and Christes merits would still
remaine, though Rome were turned into ashes and the Pope into
nothing: howbeit as a late writer hath well obserued [ignorance
is now become generally so powerfull a tyrant, as it
hath set true Philosoiphie, Physicke, and Diuinitie, in a
pillorie, and witten ouer the first, Contra negantem principia,
ouer the second, virtusspecifica, and ouer the third, Ecclesia
Romana, making it the onely market, or rather Monople, both
for deuotion and saluation.]
                  That there is a visible Church, in which the Elect and
Reprobate are blended together, in the outward profession
of supernaturall verities, and the precious meanes of saluation,
nay in the illumination of the minde, and sundrie inward
graces, Caluine denieth not; but that none are true
and liuely members of the mysticall body of CHRIST, which
hee hath ransomed with his blood, and doeth quicken and
formalize with his Spirit, and will finally crowne with eternall
blisse, saue the Congregation or Church of the first
borne, whose names are written in heauen, hee truely affirmeth:
And if Caluin deceiue vs herein, so doeth S. Augustine
too, who in his third booke of Christian doctrine, and 32.
Chapter, disputing against Ticonius, who had called the mysticall
bodie of CHRIST, (which is most properly, and principally
the Church) a body bipartie, as including both
good and bad, vseth these wordes, [Non ita debuit appellari,
non enim reuera Domini corpus est, quod cum illo non erit in aeternum:
                     
It ought not so to haue beene called, in as much as it
is not truely the bodie of CHRIST, which shall not euerlastingly
bee with him] nay, not onely Caluin and Augustine
deceiue vs, but S. Paul in the fourth to the Ephesians, the
fifteenth and sixteenth verses: and againe in the fift Chapter
of the same Epistle, the 25. and 26. verses: but for the better
clearing of this point, wee must conceiue, that the Elect, or
Predestinate of God, are of two sorts, some elect onely, and
not yet called, some both elect and called: of the latter
there is no question, but they are the principall parts of the
Church of God; and touching the former, they are not actually
in the Church, but onely potentially in Gods prescience
and predestination, who hath purposed that they shall bee,
and knoweth that they will bee: when wee say then, that
none but the Elect of God are of the Church of God, wee
meane not, that others are not at all, nor in any sort of the
Church, but that they are not fully and finally of the speciall
number of them, who pertake of the most perfect worke,
force, and vertue of that sauing grace, whereof that Church is
the onely dispenser.
                  Neither can this Church serue a Turkes turne aswell as a
Christians, for whom he did predestinate, them also hee called;
and whom hee called, them also hee iustified; and whom hee iustified,
them also hee glorified; since then hee neither calls, nor
iustifies Turkes, wee are sure they cannot be of the company
of the predestinate: But his Maiestie himselfe (I now remember)
well concluded this point, at the conference at Hampton
Court, and therefore wee neede not feare his being deceiued
in iudgement; his determination is, that [wee should iudge of
our Predestination, not so much descendendo, by prying into Gods
secret counsell, as ascendendo by searching our owne hearts; the
sincerity of our owne hearts, being as it were, the counterpane of Gods
eternall decree, locked vp in the Cabinet of his counsell;] and therefore
the Apostle in the 2. to Tim. and the 2. ioynes them both
together: The foundation of God (saith hee) remaineth sure, and
hath this seale, The Lord knoweth who are his: there is the Instrument

sealed on Gods part; the Counterpane on ours instantly
followes: and [let euery one that calleth on the Name of
CHRIST, depart from iniquitie.] So that the way to assure our
selues that wee are in the number of those that are sealed to
life, is to call on the name of CHRIST, in our profession, and
depart from iniquitie, in our conuersation; the one is required
in our life, and the other in our beliefe.
                  Neither is the faith of such beleeuers, an opinion, or fancie,
but the ground of things which are hoped for, and the euidence
of things which are not seene, and a shield to quench
all such fiery and venemous dartes; nor is their hope, a presumption;
but a sure anchor against despaire, nor their charitie,
lust; but the loue of their neighbours, as of themselues;
nor their God, an idole; but that Lord, who hath reuealed
himselfe vnto vs in his word; whereas on the other side,
we may iustly say, that the Popes Ecclesia malignantium, may
more easily serue a Turke, her Religion being rebellion, &amp; her
practice, murthering of soules and bodies, (as it acknowledged
in theAppointed for the day of our deliuerance from the Powder treason. publike prayers of our Church,) her faith beeing
but wauering, and full of irresolution, her hope a balancing
and estimation of her owne merit, her charity an ostentation
of workes, no God so powerfull with her, and beneficiall vnto
her as the Pope and the Masse. We know that all religions begin
their Creed with I beleeue in God, but none haue lesse reason
then they, who beleeue in him in generall, without particular
application; and for S. Augustines testimonies, that to an heretike,
the entertainement and imbracing of his fantasies is his
religion, I demand which is more likely to build his religion

I desire, and hope for euer to continue.

him mouth to mouth, but Mr. Doctour will not promise that,
except he be first assured his Letter may finde entertainment,

not to commit them, and whereas he imputes his faults to his
sudden writing, in imitation belike of Campian, therein he addes
another fault to his former, in as much as a great part of this
was written long before his Maiesties command came to his
hands, partly in a Latine Epistle to Mr. Casaubon, and partly in
an English letter to an honourable person in Court, and yet
for any great matter is in it, in my iudgment it needed no long
deliberation; as it was suddenly written; (if it were so) so may it
somewhat mooue a man of a suddaine apprehension, but
surely the grauer and wiser sort I thinke, it will little affect.

Church: As your soule then was with them, when your body
was with vs, so your body being with them, your soule was
then busie working here with vs, but for their purposes; and
sure except you altered your opinions set downe in this treatise,
(and I haue cause to feare you entertained worse, dying
So Pelitier in his narration published of his death, witnesseth. among the Iesuits) better you should stay there, both in body
and soule, or send your soule out of your body, and your body to
the graue, as in Gods prouidence you haue done, then to
returne to infect that Countrey and Church, in which you
were borne and bred, and baptized, which as you professed in
your last Sermon before his Maiesty, and in writings which I
haue to shew vnder your owne hand, might iustly contend with
any Church in the world, for purity of doctrine.
                  
                  But it seemes you had forgotten (being but a nouice in that
doctrine) you were to passe by Purgatory before you came to
heauen, except you supposed the Spaw waters had sufficiently
purged you, or else you presumed farre vpon the merit of your
profound demonstrations, as if thereby you needed not De
profundis to be sung, nor Masse to be said for your deliuerance
from thence, but that you must presently iumpe into heauen:
I durst warrant, the Iesuits, among whom you died, did not esteem,
you such a Saint. Indeed Castellanus who made the funerall
oration vpon Francis the 1. the French King, was excepted
against, and accused by the Sorbonists for saying, That he doubted
not, but the Kings soule was in heauen; but his purgation
was made by Mendoza, that he thought he called by Purgatorie
in passing, but being as he was of a stirring disposition, hee
made no stay there; but I thinke M. Doctor, who offers to vndertake
the iustifying of all Romish doctrine, was not of this
opinion: We teach with S. Iohn, that [
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        . 14. 13. 
                     Blessed are the dead which
die in the Lord, for they rest from their labours.] But M. Doctor
should haue remembred that the Church of Rome teacheth
with Virgil, (whose authority Bellarmine solemnly quoteth
to that purpose) That the soules of the most iust (except they

die by Martyrdome, or presently after Baptisme, or doe some
notable Meritorious worke (as for the purpose; the killing of
a King whom that Church shall iudge a Tyrant) are all to bee
scoured in the flames of Purgatory fire, before they enter into
heauen.]
                  But in the meane time, you say, you will reioyce in nothing
but onely in the Crosse of Christ, which is the glory of his Maiesties
Crowne; where,Gal. 16. 4. if by the Crosse of Christ you vnderstand, as S.
Paul did, Christ Crucified, you do well, hee being indeed, not
only the Glory of his Maiesties Crowne, but the Crowne of his
and our glory; but if the materiall Crosse, or a painted or carued
Crucifix, this could bring but a shadow of ioy to you, and
of glory to his Maiesties Crowne.
                  
                  Lastly, you conclude, that you are not gone from his Maiestie
to his aduersaries, but before him to his Mother: For the first
of which I demaund, who his Maiestie shall account for his
aduersaries, but those who condemne such Romane Catholikes,See Widdringt

censuring their Books, and commaunding them to purge
themselues, who onely maintaine his Ciuill power in Temporall
affaires, and restraine his subiects from taking the Oath
of meere naturall Allegeance, which in effect is all one as if
they absolued them from that Oath being taken, and consequently
incouraged them to rebellion? For the second part of
your conclusion, we doubt not but his Maiesties Mother might
find mercie, knowing no better religion, then that in which
shee was borne and bred, when such Apostates, as our of discontent,
or for temporall respects, forsake a knowen trueth,
which they haue preached, in which they were baptized, to
which they haue subscribed, shall finde heauen gates shut against
them. But wee1. Cor. 4. 5.

Lord come, who will lighten things that are in darkenesse, and make
the counsels of the heart manifest: and then shall euery man haue
praise of God: Who so confirme vs, in that we are right, and
reforme vs, in that we are amisse, that passing through things
temporall, wee may not finally lose eternall: Now prayse and
honour, and glory, and power, bee vnto him that sitteth vpon the

            AN ANSWERE TO
THE MATERIALL POINTS
of a second Letter of Dr. Cariers, written
also from Leige, to his friends
heere in ENGLAND.
            
               WHen I had almost finished my former answere
to the Doctors Letter to his Maiestie,
another Letter of his, dated also from Leig
                     •
                  ,
and directed to his friends in England, came
to mine hands; wherunto are added, certaine
collections found in his Closet, made by him (as
it is thought saith the Publisher) of the miserable endes of
such as haue impugned the Catholike Church: to which is also annexed
a briefe exhortation to perseuere constantly in the sayd Catholike
Church, what opposition soeuer may occurre: and lastly, a
few examples of the admirable felicitie of such as haue defended the
same Church.
            
            First then for the Letter, I must confesse, I expected from
Mr. Dr. some piece of greater value, considering himselfe had
promised vs in the last Section of his first chapter, particularly
to iustifie and make plaine frō point to point the Religion at this day
practised and prescribed by the Church of Rome; &amp; Pelitier for
him, that hauing consigned his writings into the hands of one of his
friends, wee should shortly haue that happinesse, as to see them published,
to the ioy and comfort of Catholikes, and the edification of

those whom hee had forsaken: But at last we haue receiued for
payment, in ful satisfaction of the whole debt (as I conceiue)
this Letter, with the appertenances; which I would haue set
downe intire as I found it, (the very sight of it being confutation
sufficient;) but that I should haue done the Printer iniury
in staying his presse, and withall haue raised my booke to a
bulk, too far exceeding my purpose; and it may be haue deceiued
the reader too, in offring that to his view, which he would
haue iudged scarce worth the reprinting. In his entrance,
after his verball flourishes, and the repetition of that which
hath already been answered, more then once, if any way materiall;
hee settles at length vpon nine Propositions, the very
marrow and pi
                  •
               h of all his Letter, all tending to draw what
hee might from the authority of Scriptures, and to cast it vpon
the Church, that is in his language, the Romish Clergie, as
afterwards hee expresses himselfe; I will examine the propsitions
as they lie in order.
            
               B. C.
               1.
               That our Sauiour did leaue nothing in writing, but taught his
Religion to his Apostles by word of mouth.
            
            
               G. H.
               1.
               Doubtlesse our Sauiour was not of that Polish Cardinals
minde, who thought it had beene better for the Church, had
there beene no Scripture extant at all: for though himselfe left
nothing in writing touching his Religion, yet by the Scriptures
alone hee proues himselfe to be the Messias in his conferences,
his Sermons, his disputations: with it hee informes
the ignorant, confirmes the weake, instructs his Disciples,
confutes the Pharisees, puts the Sadduces to silence, and the

diuell to fl
                     •
                  ght. Not a booke of Moses, and scarce a Prophet
but hee either quotes some passages from him, or at least alludes
to some in him, specially that of the Psalmes and the
Prophet Esay. Nay, in the 24. of St. Luke, it is said, hee proued
his passion and resurrection from Moses, and all the Prophets.
Though it were hee that spake to the Patriarches, in
dreames, and visions, and Reuelations, yet hee mentions none
of them for proofe, and except they were 
                     〈◊〉
                  , much lesse
traditions; but his ordinarie questions and exh
                     •
                  rtations, and
reprehensions are: How readest thou? and haue yee not read?
and search the Scriptures, and yee erre not knowing the Scriptures,
and for traditions he names them not but to reiect them.
               Secondly, it is acknowledged by the greatest Clerks, and
chiefest pillars of the Church of Rome, that the Euangelists in
writing their Gospels, and the Apostles their Epistles, were
none other but the pens of a ready Writer, the Secretaries of
their Lord and Master: now that which the Secretarie writes
according to the direction and inditing of his Lord, more
commonly is, &amp; more iustly ought to be called the writing of
the Lord then the Secretarie; it is St. Augustines reason in the
last Chapter of his first booke of the consent of the Euangelists.
Cum Euangelistae (saith hee) &amp; Apostoli scripserunt quae
Deus ostendit &amp; dixit, nequaquam dicendum est quod ipse non scripserit;
quicquid enim ille de suis factis &amp; dictis nos legere voluit,
hoc scribendum illis tanquam suis manibus imperauit. In as much
as the Euangelists and Apostles wrote that which God manifested
and spake, it cannot be said that himselfe wrote not; for
whatsoeuer his pleasure was wee should reade, touching his
workes and words, that he gaue them in charge to write, as it
had beene with his owne fingers.
               Thirdly, it is reported by Eusebius, lib. 1. cap. 13. that our Sauiour
left in writing a letter to Abgarus King of Edessa, the copie
whereof he there setteth downe at large, affirming the originall
to haue bene kept among the publique Records of that
Citie: but for mine owne part I must needs say, that if it bee
not fained, I can not conceiue why it should not be receiued
as canonicall.
               
                  
Fourthly and lastly, it may very well bee, that our Sauiour
wrote nothing himselfe, in as much as those things which were
to bee written, were testimonies concerning himselfe: for
though it be true, in regard of his diuine authoritie, which hee
deliuers in the eight of St. Iohns Gospel [Though I beare record
of my selfe,
                  Vers. 14. 
                  yet my Record is true] Yet in regard of the apprehension
of flesh and blood, it is as true which he hath in the fifth
of the same Gospel,V

                     rs
                        •
                      31. 
                  If I should beare witnesse of my selfe, my witnesse
were not true.
               
            
            
               B. C.
               2.
               That our Sauiour commanded not his Apostles to write his Religion
but to teach it, Ite praedicate.
               
            
            
               G. H.
               2.
               As if a man might not teach as well by his pen as his tongue,
by writing as speaking; nay, doctrine deliuered by writing, as
it is conueyed more purely and certainely without mixture,
arising from humane frailtie and corruption; so it spreads farther
and lasts longer, and if it degenerate, is more easily reformed.
It is worthy to bee marked, which St. Luke hath in the
Preface of his Gospel to that noble Theophilus: Hee confesseth,
that he had beene instructed in the doctrine of Religion,
yet hee thought to write vnto him from point to point, that hee
might haue the certainety of those things, so that though hee had
indifferent good knowledge before, yet writing the storie, was
the meanes to beget certainety: so saith Dauid, This shall bee
written for the generation to come. Neither to my remembrance
doe I reade of any that forbad their followers to write, but
onely the Pythagoreans and the Druides: Once wee are sure
that it pleased Almighty God to countenance the writing of
holy Scripture by his owne practice, in as much as hee wrote
                  Exed. 31. the Decalogue, once and againe, in tables of stone: And as he

led the way himselfe, so in expresse termes he commanded his
seruants the Prophets to doe the like,Exod. 17. 14.

                     sai. 8. 1. i

                  Moses, and Esay, and
Ieremy, and Ezekiel, and Habacuk. Before the Law was written,
what vniuersall apostasies there were from the true worship
of God, the floud is a sufficient testimonie; and after it
was lost, though the Priesthood continued, what generall
swaruings there were both of Prince and people, as well in maners
as religion, appeares, 2. Chro. 34. What forbids vs then to
thinke that our Sauiour in commanding his Apostles to teach
all nations, should not by vertue of that command, as well
giue them in charge to publish their doctrine by writing, as to
deliuer it by word of mouth.
               Besides, whiles wee reade in the first of the Reuel. at the
11. verse, that he who was dead, and is aliue, commands Iohn to
write those things which he saw in a booke; and againe at the 19.
verse, Write the things which thou hast seene, and the things which
are, and the things which shall come hereafter. And againe in the
second and third Chapters, in particular to the Angel of the
Church of Ephesus write, to the Angel of the Church of Smyrna
write, to the Angel of the Church of Pergamus write, to the
Angel of the Church of Thyatira write, to the Angel of the
Church of Sardis write, to the Angel of the Church of Philadelphia
write, to the Angel of the Church of Laodicea
write; while (I say) we finde the charge of writing so often
giuen to Iohn, and that by him who was dead and is aliue, I can
neuer subscribe to the trueth of that Proposition, that our
Sauiour commanded none of his Apostles to write, except I
should denie S. Iohn to haue beene an Apostle, or our Sauiour
to be vnderstood by him, who was dead and is aliue.
               
            
            
               B. C.
               3.
               That of the twelue Apostles, seuen did leaue nothing at all in
writing, but taught their Successours the Religion of Christ
by word of mouth.
            
            
               
               G. H.
               3.
               This Proposition supposeth the number of the Apostles to
haue bene but twelue; whereas Matthias made the thirteenth,
and Paul the fourteenth, who proclaimes it in the front of the
greatest part of his fourteene seuerall Epistles Paul an Apostle:
But it may be Mr. Doctor will not vouchsafe him that name,
because he wrote more then any of the Apostles.
               Secondly, in the fifteenth of the Actes, wee reade, that the
Apostles met together in Councill, wrote Letters, the very tenour
whereof there appeares; neither can it be otherwise conceiued,
but that the whole number of them, or at leastwise the
greatest part was there assembled: So that to say, that seuen of
them left nothing in writing, is both derogatorie from the authoritie
of Scripture, and in it selfe vniustifiable.
               Thirdly it may very wel be, that seuen of them left nothing els
but that Letter in writing; not because they held it sufficient to
teach only by word of mouth (as Mr. Doctor would imply)
but because sixe of them had written, which how needfull it
was they should performe, appeareth aswell by SaintPhil. 3. 1. 
                  Paul, as
SaintVers 3. 
                  Iude.
               
               Fourthly and lastly, though nothing of their writing bee
come to our hands, yet it is not certaine whether they left nothing
in writing; since it is probable that Saint Paul wrote another
Epistle to the1. Cor. 5. 9. 
                  Corinth. which is now no where extant.
            
            
               B. C.
               4.
               That Saint Marke, Saint Luke, and Saint Paul, were not of
Christs company whiles he was vpon the earth, and therefore
must needs learne their Religion of the Church before they
wrote it.
            
            
               
               G. H.
               4.
               Here I must confesse I could not but wonder what Mr. Dr.
meant, if hee had read and beleeued Saint Pauls Epistle to the
Galathians, in affirming that hee learned his Religion of the
Church, whereas himselfe in the first and second Chapter of
that Epistle, inforceth the contrary, with so many and so inuincible
arguments, that they can not but instantly stop the
mouth of any, who would offer to open it in defence of Mr.
Doctours assertions. Now I certifie you brethren, (saith hee)
that the Gospel which was preached of mee, was not after man, for
neither receiued I it of man, neither was I taught it; but by the Reuelation
of Iesus Christ.
               
               Secondly for Saint Marke and Saint Luke, though they
learned their Religion of the Church by hearing the Apostles,
as the Apostles themselues did from Christ, by hearing and
seeing him: yet doth it not follow but the former, as well as
the latter, wrote by the instinct and direction of the holy
Ghost: nay doubtlesse it were no lesse then impietie once to
imagine the contrary: To which purpose the words of Bellarmine
are worthy obseruation.De C

               Lastly for S. Luke, he learned not the actes of the Apostles
which he wrote from the Church, himselfe being an actour in
a chiefe part of them, and whereas Mr. Doctor affirmes, that
he was not of Christs company whiles he was vpon the earth;

the 24. of S. Lukes Gospel, and the 13. verse, assures vs that
graue Doctors (by whome I take it hee meanes the Fathers)
were of opinion that S. Luke was one of those two Disciples,
whom our Sauiour instructed as they were iournying to Emmaus.

               5.
               That diuers others did write the Religion of Christ, as they did
apprehend it, but their Gospels and Epistles were reiected by
the Church, Luke 1. 1.

               In the Primitiue Church a great part of the beleeuers, but
specially their guides, were miraculously indued, as with other
gifts; so with a discerning spirit, and that not onely in differencing
the sinnes and persons of men; but iudging of their
writings: so that though they wrote a trueth, touching the
Christian religion, yet were they able to discerne whether that
trueth were written, by speciall illumination and instinct of
the same spirit, wherewith themselues were inspired: whereupon
wee haue good reason to accept what they accepted as
Canonicall, and as Apocryphall to reiect what they reiected:
but for the present Church, though it should tenne thousand
times reiect the whole, or any parcell of that written trueth
which they accepted; yea, though one from the dead, or an Angel
from heauen should preach any other Gospel: yet ought wee
rather to accurse then beleeue him; notwithstanding the
Church of Rome, as if she were inuested with equall or higher
power, though indeede shee reiect no booke as Apocryphall,
which that Church accepted as Canonical, yet doth she accept
and impose diuers bookes as Canonicall, which that reiected
as Apocryphall.

               That the Scriptures were written by men of the Church, admitted
Canonicall by Councils of the Church, preserued from tyrants
by the care of the Church, and euer vntill late expounded
by the consent of the Church.

                  That the Scriptures were written by men of the Church,
we confesse; yet so, as withall it cannot bee denied, but those
holy men wrote as they were moued by the holy Ghost: We

also confesse; that they were admitted Canonicall, by the
Councils of the Church, that is declared, not made to bee so:
and likewise that hitherto they haue been preserued by the
care of the Church, which therefore is called,1. Tim. 3. 15. 
                  The pillar and
ground of trueth; neither ought they to be expounded, but by
the consent of the Church, if wee speake of exposition to bee
publikely allowed and receiued, touching fundamentall
points; otherwise both Caietane, and Andradius, and Iansenius,
and Maldonat, and diuers others of the Church of Rome, in
sundrie places professe, that they rest not satisfied in any interpretation
giuen by the Fathers, but preferre either their
owne, or some other found out in this age: So that if Mr. Doctor
by the Church, vnderstand the Fathers, wee haue no reason
to barre our selues of that liberty, which the chiefe Doctors
of the Church of Rome, both challenge as due, and practice as
needfull; yet so, as wee vse that libertie with moderation and
sobrietie, the people submitting their iudgements to their
Pastours, and the Pastours in seuerall to their bodie vnited, or
represented: where no very cleare and manifest reason appeareth
to the contrary.

               How fewe men are able to reade, and expound Scriptures any
way, and whether it be not easier to beleeue the Church, then
to beleeue a few priuate men, that say they can expound
Scriptures better then the Church.
            
            
               G. H.
               8.
               If wee should follow the rules and practise of the Church of
Rome, fewer would bee able either to expound or reade the
Scriptures then now are. Espencaeus, a Dr. of the Sorbon, witnesseth,

that hee was told by an Italian Bishop, that his Countreymen
were terrified from reading the Scriptures, lest they
should become herettikes; but the Doctor demaunding what
Arte they then professed? why quoth the Bishop, both the
Lawes, but specially the Canon: And Robert Stephens demanding
some of the Doctors of the Sorbon, in what place some
passage of the New Testament was written? they answered,
that they had read it in Hierome, or the decrees: but for the
New Testament, they were ignorant what it was; nay one of
them was wont to sweare by the light, that hee wondered
yong men talked so much of the New Testament, himselfe
being fifty yeeres old before he vnderstood so much as what
it meant: and if such blinde guides leade the blinde, what
marueile if both fall into the ditch.
               Now for beleeuing priuate men, I would faine know how the
common people in their Church, come to know the exposition
of the Church, or the Church it selfe, but by the information
of priuate men: And if any of ours preferre their owne
iudgement before the current opinion (which I suppose Mr.
Doctor meanes by the exposition of the Church) I haue
shewed before vpon what ground they doe it, and that therein
they doe no more then those very Romish Diuines, who complaine
most of them.

               9.
               Though the deuill falsly alleaged Scripture, yet our SAVIOVR
thought it no sufficient reason to forbeare the alleaging

of it; and though the Pharises pretended the authoritie of the
Church, yet hee imbraced not their corrupt glosses, leauing vs
an example in both to follow his steps.
               
                  Vpon these Propositions, Mr. Doctour inferreth, that the
onely way to finde the true religion of CHRIST, is to enquire
which is the true Church of CHRIST; now to knowe the
Church (saith he) our Sauiour did found, we must obserue that
this word doth signifie diuerse things, sometimes the House of
Gods seruice, sometimes the Congregation of all those that
are Baptized, and sometimes the Clergie or Spiritualtie; and in
this sence alone our Sauiour founded a Church when hee did call
and send his Apostles, and gaue them the same power, which himselfe
as man had receiued of his Father. Then to know which
is the true Church (saith he) we must inquire which is the Clergie
that was founded by CHRIST, and continueth in the Vnitie of
the Church by perpetuall Succession from the Apostles, and so
from CHRIST himselfe: And for certaine resolution thereof,
he referreth vs to three arguments, as he calleth them infallible,
whereof the first is, Th
                     •
                   report of Chronicles and Histories;
The second is, The Vniuersalitie, Antiquitie, and consent
of doctrine, taught in the true Church, and The varietie, noueltie,
and repugnancie taught in Schisme: And herein you may inquire
(saith hee) of the most learned and most honest to informe
you: The thirde is, The testimonie of Scriptures of the olde and
new Testament.
               For answere to this inference, I would willingly learne
where Mr. Doctour learned those acceptions of the Church;
once I am sure he taketh it otherwise then it is taken in holy
Scripture; and againe in holy Scriptures it is taken otherwise
then he taketh it: Neither are his two former meanes for the
finding out of the Church more iustifiable, then his acceptions
of the Church; whereof the first is the report of Chronicles; but
to grant that all Chronicles spake as the Pope would haue
them, yet were all this but humane testimony, a sufficient inducement
to moue, but no sufficient ground for the conscience
to build vpon. For the proofe of his second reason he refers
his reader to the information of the most learned and most honest.
                  
But how if as learned and more honest informe him, and
that more truely to the contrary? Here needes a farther inquirie;
which Mr. Doctor foreseeing, at length sends vs to the
Scripture as being forced with vs, to confesse that the last resolution,
and onely infallible stay of the Christian soule in
search both of the trueth it selfe, and consequently of the true
Church, professing and publishing that truth, must n

            ¶A briefe Answere to the other collections
annexed to the Doctors
last Letter.
            
               NOw for those other Collections which are added
to his Letter, as the Publisher makes a doubt, whether
they were made by him or no, so I make no
doubt, if hee had liued, hee would neuer haue suffered
them to come to the light in such sort, as now they are
published: Notwithstanding, because they appeare in his
name, I held it not amisse to make some answere vnto them:
First then, for the miserable ends of such as haue opposed the Catholike
Church; hee brings the example of Iudas, and Caiphas,
and Annas, and the three Herods, and Pontius Pilate, and Nero,
and Domitian, and Pharaoh, and Haman, and Iezebel, and
Antiochus, and Ieroboam, and a number of like stuffe: After he
comes to Arch-heretikes, translating word for word what
Bellarmine thereof hath obserued in his 17. Chapter, of the
notes of the Church: where hee makes the 14. note to bee,
Infaelix exitus seu finis eorum qui Ecclesiam oppugnant, The vnhappy
end of such as haue oppugned the Church, the greatest part
of which (excepting those last which Maister Doctor is pleased
to call the monsters of our age,) we condemne as farre foorth
as the Doctor did, or Bellarmin doth. But for the fabulous narration
of their ends, wee may truely say, that Bellarmine as vniustly
voucheth the authoritie of Cochlaeus, and Bolsecke, as the
Doctor suppresseth Bellarmines. For what law humane or diuine,
ciuill or naturall, admitteth a mans mortall and sworne
enemie to bee witnesse against him? Yet such was Cochlaeus
vnto Luther, and Zuinglius, and Bolseck vnto Caluin: who
both as they deadly hated them for their religion, (as the Samaritanes
               
did the Iewes) so had Bolseck a particular grudge against
Caluin, for that hee opposed himselfe so vehemently against
his wicked errours, and seditious practices in Geneua, as
hee procured his banishment from thence: which mooued
him to seeke this base kinde of reuenge vpon him, the rather

of Caluin, to recouer his lost credit with them: And
as being their malicious enemies, they would not report the
trueth, so not being present at their endes, they could not haue
certaine knowledge thereof; at leastwise their testimonie
cannot with any reasonable or indifferent mindes counterpoise
the euidence of those worthy men, who were eye-witnesses,
and present with them: For Pluris est oculatus testis vnus,

then of them that were present: But let vs particularly, and seuerally,
but briefly examine their slanders.
            
               Luther (saith the Doctor, out of the Cardinall, and the
Cardinall himselfe out of Cochlaeus) died suddenly: for hauing
supped very delicately and pleasantly, being in perfect health, and
hauing delighted all his companie with merrie conceits, the same
night hee died. ButDesig. Eccl. lib. 23. c. 3. 
               Tho. Bozius, a Friar of the new Oratory
order, reporteth otherwise, and that vpon the testimonie of
one that then was Luthers seruant, but since (as hee saith) became
theirs in religion; namely, that hee hanged himselfe, and
that foorthwith an oath was taken of all that were present, not to
publish it for the honour (as they sayd) of the Gospell: Thus they
agree not in their tales, no more then the false witnesses did
against Christ: Neither is it strange, that Cochlaeus and Bozius
deuise such slanders against him since his death, seeing euen
in his life time they spared not to publish in Print,Lonic

dead, and when hee was laid into his graue, there was a terrible
noyse heard, as if the foundations of the earth had been shaken, to
the affrightment of all, &amp; the night after there was yet a more fearefull
noise heard about his graue, which made the people run thither

all amazed, but opening it, they could find nor bodie, nor bones, nor
clothes, onely they smelt a horrible stinke of brimstone. This Luther
himselfe read, and in detestation of such blasphemie, publikely
protested against it; as not long since Beza did, being
handled in like maner: But returne wee vnto Cochlaeus: First,
where he sayth, that the supper before hee died hee was in perfect
health, they who knew him better, tell vs, that before he came
to Islib, (whither hee was sent for by the Earles of Mansfield,
to compose a controuersie betweene them) hee was very
sickly, and that hee had a long time been troubled with oppression
of humors in the orifice of his stomacke. Secondly,
where hee sayth, that hee supped delicately and pleasantly, and
delighted all his company with merrie conceits; surely they that
were present testifie, that his merry conceits were but holy and
religious discourses; for being demaunded at supper time,
Whether in that eternall life wee should know one another, hee answered
affirmatiuely, and confirmed the same by testimonie of
Scripture: according asLib. 2. 15 46. 
               Thuanus also, a Papist by profession,
but of more authoritie then an hundred Cochlaeusses, doth relate.
Lastly, where hee sayth, that hee died suddenly the same
night: neither died he the same night, but the next day betwixt
8. and 9. of the clocke, nor yet suddenly, for perceiuing his sicknesse
to grow vpon him, and feeling within him the summons
of death, hee gaue many sweete and comfortable exhortations
to them that were about him, and commended himselfe vnto
God in a most heauenly and effectuall prayer, and so quietly,
and by little and little died. And these things are testified by
Iustus Ionas, who attended him euen vnto the last gaspe, and by
Melancthon, and others of his best acquaintance: Whereunto I
adde out ofLoco supra citato. 
               Thuanus, that as in his life time hee was dearely beloued,
so in his death could they not be drawen from his loue: For they
of Mansfield were earnest, that his bodie might be buried amongst
them, in as much as there he was borne: but Io. Frederick preuailed
so farre by his authoritie, that his bodie was caried backe to
Wittenberg, and there honourably interred: So that though
Papists burst for spight and enuie, it could not be without the
finger of God, that so meane a man as Luther, so boldly opposing

himselfe against the Pope, (whom Kings and Emperours
at that time durst not without great danger resist) yet liued
so long, died so peaceablie, and was buried so honourably.
            The next is Zuinglius, who as the Doctor, out of the same
Cochlaeus saith, was slaine in warre, which he made against the Catholikes.
Indeede that Zuinglius was slaine in the fielde, neither
is, nor can bee denied: but I would faine learne why so
to die should be counted an vnhappie ende, or why that, which
as seemes to mee, is an argument of his courage and magnanimitie,
should bee esteemed an argument of heresie.Apol. p. 3. c. 9. If you
say hee was slaine fighting against Catholikes: so haue many
of your Romish Catholikes fighting against Protestants: And if
Costers defence of Sanders, who was slaine in Ireland be sufficient,
He, with other Priests aided the armie in those things which
concerne the conscience, Quid hic mali? What euil is herein? The
same Apologie may I farre more iustly make for Zuinglius: He
according to the laudable custome of that countrey, went as
a Preacher with the armie, Quid hic mali? What euill is
herein? Onely here lies the difference, that Sanders like a
traitour and rebell fighting against his Prince and Countrey,
perished miserably: but Zuinglius like a good Patriot, fighting
in defence of his Countrey, died valiantly: Of whose
innocencie therein, God himselfe, as to mee it seemes, hath
giuen this testimonie, that when his enemies hauing found his
bodie, threw it into the fire to burne it, yet his heart could neuer
be consumed, asLib. 1. ann

the Dr. saith, that going to bed in good health one night,

men) was an eye-witnesse, and present at his death: He therefore
reporteth that he kept his bed sixteene dayes before his death:
that in the meane season hee often exhorted them that were about
him to prayer, and to die constantly for the Name of CHRIST,
professing that hee went cheerefully to the Tribunall of CHRIST.
The last night of his life, demaunding of a friend that came to visite

him, what newes? and he answering, None, Then (quoth he) can I
tell you newes; Shortly shall I be with the Lord IESVS: Soone after
one asking whether the light did not trouble him? Here, quoth
he laying his hand on his breast, is store of light: After this, as well as
his tongue could vtter it, he repeated that excellent praier of Dauid
for Remission of sinnes, and that entirely from the beginning vnto
the end, fetching withall many deepe grones from the bottome of his
heart: Then pawsing a while he said, CHRIST IESV saue mee,
which was his very last speech: And so hee died with much peace
and tranquilitie of mind: Thus farre Grynaeus.
            The fourth is Carolostadius, whom, saith the Dr. the Ministers
of Bazil write to haue beene killed of a Diuell, in their Epistle
of the death of Carolostadius. It cannot be denyed but that Carolostadius
was a man ful of many imperfections, and suspected
to incline too much vnto Anabaptisme: yet is this report a meere
fiction, and the Epistle out of which it is vouched, a very counterfeit,
as diuers haue written, which Fr. Iunius saith, he vnderstood
by sufficient men, who were present at his death.
            The last is Iohn Caluin who (saith the Dr.) was eaten and
consumed with wormes, and dyed as did Antiochus, Hunery,
Maximinus, &amp;c. as witnesseth Hieron. Bolseck in his life; who
also addeth that he died blaspheming, cursing, &amp; inuocating diuels.

for the space of full seauen yeeres fought with diuers diseases
and griefes, yet was he therefore neuer a whit lesse diligent in
his function, nor absteined from continuall writing, and at
length died of the disease called the difficulty of breathing.
Nay Genebrard though farre from the ingenuitie of Thuanus,
and one that raileth most impotently vpon Caluin, yet durst
not charge him herewith, and was ashamed to defile his Chronicle
with such an impudent lie. Fr. Iunius saith, that hee was
at Geneua then wen Caluin dyed, yet neither saw nor heard, nor
knew, nor perceiued any such thing, nor so much as euer dreamed of

any such matter: In a word, he was visited in his sickenesse by
sundrie excellent personages, by the Syndicks of the Citie, by
the Ministers, by others, all which are witnesses of the sickenesse
whereof hee dyed. AndIn vita Cal. 
               Theod. Beza, who faithfully
wrote his life and death, whereof (as he saith) hee had beene a
spectator sixteene yeeres together, testifieth that in him was proposed
vnto all, a most excellent patterne of Christian both life and death,
which (saith he) is as easie to calumniate, as it is hard to imitate.
These things considered, I referre mee now vnto the Readers
indifferencie, whether is more worthy of credite, the whole
Citie of Geneua, and so many notable men present at his sicknesse
and death, and testifying of his peaceable, holy, and Christian
departure: or one Hieron. Bolseck, a Knight of the poste,
twice banished, thrice a runagate, who of a Carmelite, became
a Physitian, or rather a Quacksaluer, a sworne enemie to Caluin,
one that had beene from Geneua more then ten yeeres together,
and had sold his pen vnto his Lords and friends to defame
Caluin. And thus much in defence of those men whom the
Dr. termeth the Monsters of our age.
            
            Now although the vnhappy end of some particular men be
no demonstratiue proofe, and scarce a coniecturall signe of the
falshood of that religion which they professe, and that Church
in which they make their last end: yet that it may appeare in
requital of the Dr. or rather the Cardinal, how vnhappily some
zealous persecutors of such, as haue forsaken fellowship with
the Church of Rome, haue ended their liues, I could referre the
Reader to a large Discourse touching that point toward the
end of the second part of the Acts and Monuments, and also in
Hassenmullerus, in the conclusion of his booke. Neither can
the like iust exception bee taken against their euidences, as against
that of Bolseck and Cochlaeus: But I will content my selfe
with the testimonie of Thuanus, a professed member of that
Church which Mr. Doctor cals Catholike; yet such a one as
besides his great paines and diligence in the search of trueth,
had singular meanes for the finding of it out himselfe, being
now President in the Court Parliament of Paris, where his father
had bin Premier President before him: This man thenLib. 3. 1547. testifies,

first of the Cardinall of S. Andrewes in Scotland, who
condemned George Wiseheart vnto the fire, that standing at a
window sumptuously set forth with cushions and hangings of
silke to behold his execution, &amp; George being exhorted when
the fire began to burne to be of good courage: This flame indeed,
answered hee, is painefull to my bodie, but it doth no
whit dismay my minde; but hee that now from aloft lookes
downe so proudly vpon me, as arrogantly as now he sits; so
ignominiously, within these fewe dayes shall hee lie along,
which soone after came to passe: for being miserably slaine,
his dead body was in the open sight of all laide along in the
same window, from whence he had so ioyfully beheld the burning
of Wiseheart: And so the euent (saith Thuanus) verified his
Prophecie.

               Iohn Roman a Monke and cruell persecutor, inuented
a new kind of torment for the persecuted; he would draw vpon
their legs, boots full of hote boiling grease, and then setting
spurres vpon their heeles iestingly, would demand of
them whether they were not sufficiently appointed for their
iourney: But vnderstanding that a summons was granted out
against him by the Parliament of Aix to answere for his cruelties,
and that by the commandement of Francis the I▪ hee fled
vnto Auinion, where thinking himselfe safe from men, yet hee escaped
not, (saith Thuanus) the vengeance of God; For he was spoiled
by his owne seruants of all that he had, and brought to extreme
pouertie: his body also was so full of loathsome vlcers,
that oftentimes he wisht for death, which yet he could not
obtaine but after a long time, and horrible torments.

for his more then barbarous cruelties, in the Parliament of Paris,
by the appointment of the said King Francis, scaped indeed
that danger by the commendation of the Guise, and together
with his Collegues was restored vnto his former dignity; neuerthelesse,
soone after he was striken with horrible paines in
his entrailes, wherewith he was a long time tormented, and at
length in the mids of most cruell torments breathed forth his
cruell soule, God (saith Thuanus) inflicting on him that iust punishment

which the iudges exacted not, which though it were long
in comming, yet fell the more heauily when it came.

               Crescentius the Popes Agent in the Council
of Trent, hauing spent much of the night in writing letters
to the Pope, and at length rising from his chaire, he seemed to
see a dog, which with huge iawes, firie eyes, and eares hanging
downe to the ground, furiously came towards him, and by
and by couched vnder the table; then calling his seruants,
and light being brought, when hee saw the dog no where appeare,
he was astonished at it, and thereupon fell into many sad
cogitations, and so into sicknesse, which he no sooner felt, but
presently hee despaired of life, although his Physicians and
friends gaue him good hope of recouery: At last being caried
from thence to Verona, and euen at deaths dore, he would often
call vpon them that attended him, to take heed of the dog,
and to keepe him from comming vpon his bed: Thus farre
out of Thuanus.

of the ends of Luther, Zuinglius, Oecolampadius and Caluin,
whom he counteth Arch-heretikes, and termeth Monsters: it
may please him to remember, that sundry of the Bishops of
Rome who haue bene very Antichrists, and by his owne Platina

fearefull and wretched ends: For some haue beene poisoned,
some murdered by Anti-Popes,
               Cron. l. 4. some haue died in prison.
Iohn the XII. euen in the very act of adultery, was suddenly
striken by the deuill (saithSum. de Eccl. l. 2. c. 103. 
               Turrecremata,) and died without
repentance, others that haue compacted with the deuill, haue
bene caried away by him, and, not to reckon vp all that thus
haue perished, seeing it would bee too tedious, fiftie Popes arow,
being rather Apostatical then Apostolicall, and monsters
of men, It is no marueile (saith Genebrard,) if they were so many
in few yeeres, and died quickly.
            
            
               His last argument is the temporall prosperity of them which
haue defended the Church: His examples are likewise a meere
translation of Bellarmines 18th. Chapter of the notes of the
Church: So that for answere thereunto, I might iustly referre
the Reader to them who haue answered him, as also to my Replie
to the fourth Section of M. Doctors second chapter of
his Letter to his Maiesty: But I chuse rather to close vp the
whole with his Maiesties words, in the latter end of his answer
to Cardinall Perrons oration: History; saith his Maiesty, and experience
teach vs, that disunion with the Pope hath no whit impeached
the prosperitie of kingdomes. Philip the faire reigned in
peace and prosperity, notwithstanding his attempts vpon the Papall

Sea. King Lewis the twelfth defeated in battell the troupes of Pope
Iuly the second, and his alies, declared him falne from the Papacie,
and caused Crowns to be stamped, wherin Rome is called Babylon;
yet neuerthelesse was loued and honoured of his subiects, who gaue
him the title of Father of the people. Neuer did Great Britaine
euer receiue so great blessings of God, nor enioyed so much peace
and plentie, as since the time that Popes haue no more but the looking
on and sent no more their Legats to gather the tribute of S. Peter,
and that the Kings of England doe no longer homage vnto the
Pope for their Crowne, and are no more lashed by Monkes.
What was Holland, Zeland, and Frizeland, before that God lighted
among them the torch of the Gospell, in comparison of the riches,
and prosperitie wherein God hath aduanced them? The Common
wealth of Venice, doeth it enioy lesse peace and prosperity then before,
since they haue taken from the Pope one of his swords, and
haue shaken off his temporall power? On the contrary side, the
Kings of France, after they had giuen vnto the Popes all what
they held in Italy, and the Countie of Auinion, haue againe receiued
of them but course entertainmēt. Popes haue forged a donation
of Constantine, to the end to deface the memory of the donation
of Pepin, and Charlemaine: They haue troubled the State, banding
themselues for the sons of Lewis the Courteous, against their
owne father, whose life was an example of innocence: They haue
skimmed the Realme of Money by infinite pillages, wherewith the
Kings of France haue endeuoured to meete, by their pragmaticall
sanction: They haue oftentimes interdicted the Realme, degraded
their Kings, sollicited their neighbours to inuade the kingdome,
stirred vp the people against the King, whence many troubles and
parricides haue ensued. Rauilliac rendred this reason of his attempt,
because, said hee, the King would make warre against God,
inasmuch as hee would make warre against the Pope, and that the
Pope was God: Which maketh mee to maruell how the Cardinall
could alleage for example the late trou

               l
                  •
               s, during which France
fell foule with the Pope, seeing that the Pope himselfe raised vp
those troubles. If the Kings or people of France, hauing offended
the Pope, God had otherwayes sent among them som
                  •
                pestilence or
famine, this might with some probabilitie haue been taken for a reuenge

of the iniurie done vnto his Vicar; but seeing the Pope
himselfe hath caused these euils, it is not God who punisheth the
iniuries done vnto the Pope, but the Pope who reuengeth himselfe,
and which is worse, without receiuing any wrong: Whence
it app
                  •
               areth, that to exhort the Kingdome to maintaine vnion with
the Pope, by the remembrance of the calamities past, is not to exhort
them to loue the Pope, but to call to minde the euils which he
hath caused, and to tremble at his thundrings, and conspiracies,
which hurt those onely that feare them, and which haue drawen
vpon my kingdome many blessings. Now if France haue had any
prosperitie during the time that it well accorded with the Pope, this
hath been because the Pope seeketh the amitie of those Princes
that are in prosperitie, and which haue meanes to annoy him:
Kings are not therefore in prosperitie because the Pope is vnited
with them, but the Pope is vnited with them because they are in
prosperitie: Euen as swallowes arriue in the spring, but make not
the spring, so the Pope ioyneth himselfe to the prosperitie of kingdomes,
but maketh not their prosperitie. But if there happen any
disaster in a Kingdome, or any ciuill warre, which putteth an
Estate in danger, the Pope vnder a shadow of hauing care of the saluation
of soules, thrusteth himselfe into the quarrell, and runneth
vnto the wracke to reape his profit thereby: And if a State change
its Master, hee will that the new possessour, vnto whom hee hath
giuen aide, hold the kingdome of his liberalitie; but if the ancient
possessour conquer his enemies, notwithstanding the Popes thundrings,
then his Holinesse offers him all sorts of Indulgences, and
out of his compassion receiueth him againe, whom hee was not able to
destroy. Hitherto his Maiestie, then which nothing can bee
spoken more fully and effectually to this purpose.
            
            For surely (not to speake of the prosperitie of forraine
countries, who haue broken off communion with the Roman
Synagogue) he is more then blind that cannot see, and too too
enuious, that seeing will not acknowledge, how extraordinarily
God hath blessed this our Realme with all kind of benedictions
more then in former times, since it held the Pope to bee
Antichrist, and Rome Babylon, and departed from them.

a Prince as the King Catholike, all the world wondred at the

               rres, so beloued at home, so feared abroad, and in a word
blessed with so continuall a course of happie successe in all
things, euen to her liues end, that it hath forced euen from
those, who almost hold it a sinne to giue the least commendation
of Protestant Princes, an ingenuous and free acknowledgment
thereof. [A man may truely say of this Princesse (saith
Lib. Hist. 6. cap. 10. 
               Florimond Raemond, otherwise a bitter enemie to these of our
Religion,) that excepting the matter of Religion, and for the
world, she had as great glorie in her kingdome, continuing in all her
affaires so well authorized, and carried matters with as great wisedome▪
as any Prince that hath liued these many yeeres.]
            But suppose we (though we haue sufficiently proued it to
be otherwise) that the defenders of the Roman Sea haue had temporall
prosperitie and felicitie, and that wee haue seldome thriued
and prospered against them; what would your Doctor hereupon
inferre? That therefore we should forsake the Church whereof
we are members, and with him retire our selues into the bosome
of the Romish Church, where temporall prosperitie and
felicitie is to be found? Indeede it may bee that this was the
Doctors chiefest motiue vnto his Apostacie, and that perceiuing
his ambitious hopes to quaile at home, hee would
trie his fortunes there, where Abbeyes, and Bishoprickes,
and perhappes also Cardinalshippes are promised to such,
as with more diligence then others, negotiate for the Pope.

that which he saith elsewhere, that the Crosse is the most precious
iewell of our Sauiour Christ, and that of this iewell hee alwayes
giueth the greatest portion to his dearest friends: For if the dearest
friends of Christ be those of whom the Church consisteth, and
they haue the greatest portion of his Crosse, then is not temporall
prosperitie and felicitie a note of your Church: and if
it be, then is not the Crosse the portion thereof. But to conclude

all, although1. Tim. 4. 
               Pietie hauè the promise euen of this life, and
the Church of God sometime abound in these worldly blessings,
yet is it with condition of the Crosse, as God shall in his
