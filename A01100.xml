            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

For this hes bene ane daylie practise and an old custome at all tymes be thame obseruit, quha with grit trauel &amp; eirnest diligence hes profited in letters: that quhensoeuer at any tyme thay ar myndit to commit their laubours vnto licht, they do harbour them vnder the countenāce &amp; couer thē vnder the autority of sum noble personage. mouit theirto be dyuers considerations, pairtly to procure sum defence and protectioun to thair works: Pairtly to purches sum commendatioun to them selfis.

            ¶THE PREFACE TO THE READER
            Being compelled to leaue france, be ye cruel persuit of papists after my arryuing to this Countrey, thair did cum into my hāds an letter derected to our Ministers, replenished wt calūnies quhilk quhan thay had perused, thay thocht it expedient that I suld answer thairto, for that the argument of that letter did concerne my selfe. I not willing to deny thair requeist, quhom in euerie way I suld reuerence: and being mair cairfull to satisfie thair desire, then affrayit of vther menis reports, haue vnder takin that quhilk I haue done.
            Bot that ȝow may vnderstand with quhat ordour we haue procedit in this apologie. Ȝe sall knaw that we haue in his calumnious letter sum things as being maist false, suppressit with silēce: vther things as hauing sum probabilitie, bot ȝit na treuth we haue so confuted yt nothing remanis quhairin this Godles Apostat may iustifie him selfe against me, or falslie alledge for farder defence. And seing that with his calumnious letter thair ar certen erroneous propositions conioynit. I haue refellit thē be this method. In placing first his propositioun, to the quhilk derectly I oppone a contrair plat, thairefter I do come to the probations of his propositions, quhilks are ather for the maist pairt impertinently brocht furth of the scripteurs, or falsly wrastit out of the docteurs Lykewayis I haue adducit the citation of the autorities as he hes placit them, that his errour &amp; ignorance may the mair appeir. In end I conclude confirming my awin plat.
            Now thairfor freindly Reader I beseik ȝow effecteously that ȝe wald not miscontrew my guid mening nor mislyke my labours heirin, bot to accept them in guid pairt. I craue for my dilygence bot a freindlie acceptance of ȝour courtesy ȝe can geue me na lesse.
            I confes in deid yt an Scoller of tender ȝeirs, of waik discretiō of raw iudgemnt, of small countenance, and litil vnderstanding can not pyke mekill praise for his trauel.
            Bot gud mettels ar not to be misly kit, thocht they be takin out

from the dustie earth. The things quhilks I haue weill spokkin ar not to be reiectit althocht I want an exteriour grauite. If any for my newnes thinks worser of me thē I was willīg to deserue &amp; if yair be sum yt for my youth wil contem me, &amp; ȝit thay not being ignorant that nemo repente summus extitit. I am content (thay being abusit ather by malice in detracting, or by lake of discretioun in discerning) to abyde thair censeur. Bot as manye things cums to passe contrair the houp and beyond the expectatioun of man, so it may happin heirin against my feare. My aduersar steared vp with enragit affectioun, &amp; be the malicious mynds of vthers, thocht to bereaue me of my lyf, bot prased be God the successe was better. Through his calumnious &amp; maist sclanderous wryting, he purposed to haue drownit me in perpetual ignominie: Bot it hes fallin out vther ways. The mair yat his malice appeareth: my honour farder (Louit be the Lord) is aduancit. For as he that straik IASON on the stomak thin king to slay him, brak his impostume with the straik, quhairby he recouered his helth: euin sa it hes hapnit with my aduersare▪ His horrible cruelty &amp; detestabil wickednes hes purchest me no small commt

            That feruent zeale in professing Christs Euangel, &amp; contemption of Idolatrie, quhair wt God of his mercy from my ȝoutheid endeued me, procurit aganis me ye enuy, &amp; indignation of idolatrous Papists quha perceuing yat nather yair friuole arguments, nor alluring promeissis, micht peswade me to abiure Christes trewe religioun, and

embrace yair feinȝeit fantasyes, &amp; forgit inuentions, tooke at lenth counsall to follow yair accustomit course, and in place of christiane admonitioun to lat me fele sic stripes, as of their foirfathers the people of God rasauit of before, quha seikand the occasioun how vnder pretence of particularities they micht coulour thair cruelty, &amp; couer thair hatred kendled against me for the cause of religion, The whisperings wherof not being vnto me secreit, nather the takins obscure, I auoidit warly, &amp; from sic maters willingly absteanit, as might haue mouit thame to execute yair enterprise. quhairthrouch thair rage being for a space deserrit mair then degestit, at last an Hammiltoun (a modest man) be sum Scottis papeists cōmandit, &amp; be others requeistit, following yair aduise to accomplish thair desire, &amp; persewing his awin determinatioun to execute his tyranie, be thir monis fulfillit it.
            To my Lord ARBROITH maister IOHNE HAY a Iesuist presented an buik composed be him contening certaine questions proponit to our ministers, I entring in my Lords Chalmer (quhairin also this apostat was present) raceauit of maister Iohne Hay another likwise, and sum of the articles thairof being disputed betuix vs, and be him mair querrelously discussit nor modestly rasonit, We fel after this prolixt disputatioun, into that article quhairby the autour of the Buik affermes the making of Images not to be contrair vnto the cōmand of God. my Lord (mouit be ane constant zele of religioun) replyit, that not onely it was derectly against the cōmand of God, but also the making of them was expresly contrair his Maiestie, he sophistically be a vaine distinctioun of representatioun &amp; adoratioun, confuslie confounding altogether, eludit Gods cōmandiment. My Lord desiring me to ansuer: be a familiar argumēt I insistit in the contrair. that cumming from S. Germains port, I did sie blind men praying

Restis then yt quhilk conueniently of this argument insewis, that this thair actioun can

not be cailit representatioun, bot adoratioun &amp; worshipping, expresly &amp; derectly contrair to the command.

               out of his Chyre, and as I had triumphit, embraced me: quhairat our maister apostat hauelie commouit, &amp; raging within him selfe, immediatly cam running from the otherside of the Chalmer, desiring me againe to receit my argument. I in place of praise &amp; victorie, desiring only the treuth to haif place, fulfillit his desire, he then in this priuie conference, thinking that he might boldly iniury me, nane being present to beir record yair to, na vther wise answerit to the consequence (thē away damnable heretique, I sal pluk ȝour Luggs, I sal ding out ȝour harnes,) to ye quhilk brauling quyetlie I replyit, that he wald offend in performing his promises, nather wald I with pacience suffer sie bragful bosting if he alane wald discharge him self of the same. This querrulous conference thus being endit, I taking my leaue of the cō
               panie, departit. And thair efter did conuene with him, and as he couartlie performit, that quhilk with baldnes he promised: I on ye vther part sumquhat commouit tuik leue at my awin hand of acquentance to visite his eare. Quhairof our countrey men (I mene thais yat ather wilfully hes abiurit thair Faith, or be a blind zeale impugnis the faming) being aduertised, &amp; grittumlie reioysing, that heirby occasion commodiously was offred, to performe that quhilk befoir was deuisit, neglectit a tyme, bot thair hail wittis spedely imploiit, to cause this apostat to put thair counsel to execution. To yat end diuers conuentionis wer halden, declaring how I contemnit thair religioun, &amp; micht not by ony moyen persuade me to embrace it. And how they micht peraduenture brokin my Lord Arbroith of his constancie, &amp; sindrie times easily persuadit him to their faction, if yat I had not by insisting in the contrair withstand thair purposis, and to agrauat the caus, &amp; to mak me ye mair odius, yai forgit infinit leis &amp; fals accusations aganist me. Finaly to persuade this burrio to tak the mater in hād thai laid befoir his eies how grittumly al Catholikkis suld be obleist vnto him, &amp; how far his auin name yairby sould be aduancit.

Bot it was not hard to consel hī, quha in ye mater was redier to obey then yai ayer to cōmand or requeist: quhair of he gaue euident signes in quhatsūeuer he come in, of ye quhilk I not being ignorant, &amp; thinking yt Dogs rather barquet throuch custōe thē throch cruelty mair of vse than of wildnes, secuirly I contemnit his brauling &amp; lichtlye regardit his boosting, seing gif yat querrell war to be debaitit (In ye quhilk al men if occasion requyre, sould spend yair lyues) or yat controuersy decydit, betuixt me &amp; him onlye, ayer be disputatioun or vthar extraordinar meanes: nather suld he find me fant in ye last, nor sluggishe in ye former. Neueryeles his malice encressing, diuers times be deceat he awaitit on me, accompaneit wt a grit number of young men, of ye quhllk sum gentil men hauing knawlege, socht ye way to stay his enterprise (wisely considering yat it was easy to him with grit force to ouercome me in Paris, quhilk in frier places and alane had perhappis not bene so facill) &amp; purchessit ten dayis abstinence, ȝit he obseruing the reul approuit amongs yame, yat na Faith sould be kepit vnto yame quhome yai esteme as heretiques. The thrid day after quhilk was ye 18 day of Marche. 1580. I not weil instructed in yat point, yat mistrust was ye Mother of Securitie, suddenly was onbeset &amp; at vnwaris inuadit be him &amp; 13 debauchit scollers: quha violenly casting yair hands all wt one preis vpon my body &amp; thrawing me to ye ground, tred me vnder yair feite. The pepill astonyit at sic lawles outrage, be sa mony persounis aganist me alane execute. Demandit Whisperingly, quhat menit sic horribill hādling &amp; cruel demaning of me? quhat was ye occasion yairof? yai esteming yat ye pepill wald haue succourit me to hinder yair helpe, cryit out yat I was a Huguenot, a Heretique, a contemnar of ye Saints &amp; a blasphemer of ye virgen Marie. quhairat yai war sa commouit, yat enragitly yai conioynit yair force wt yair fury, presing fordwart euery on to strike me, &amp; to plague me mair yan to release me of my pane. But wald God yis had bene all, quhilk was ouer mekill, or ye rest a lye, quhilk is to monstrous.

But I mene not (gentle Reders) to offend ȝour guid &amp; modest minds with the rehersall of sic immoderat iniuries, quhose eares I am assured dois glow, and haertis alreddy greuin at that quhilk I haue vterit, And ȝit I knaw that sic horrible and monstrous beistlyncs is hard to be credeit of thame quha knawes not the nature of thir cruell tygers.

            Now I can not sufficiently meruel how this feinȝit Wose, dar be so bauld as to couer sic cruel dealing with the Gabart of the Rectoris command. Truly if the mater war weil tryit in ye maturinis, he wald be found an vnthankfull suppost to staene the honnour of his chief Magistrar, with sic outragious tyranie. This I am able to proue, how boldly I can not tel, how truelie I knaw, that the executioun of this beistlie fact came soner vnto the Rectors eares: then anie complaint maid aganist me. not geuin at the requeist of this vnnaturall Dog, a vndiscreit Rector wald sa far haue extendit his autoritie, I wald knaw of this impudent lier, quhat coulour the Rector could pretend to sie suddane commands. In maters of Religion he is na ordinar iudge: for sic cases are referrit vnto the court of Parliament, befoir the quhilk willinglie I wald haue comperit, knawing assuredly that be the King his edict of pacificatioun, quhilk sic vnbry delit and debordit Brigans dois contem, and by the cleirnes of my conscience void of crime, I wald esilie bene absoluit: If he wil alledge that in particular iniureis the Rectors autoritie was iustly interponit. ȝit be na Law he can mak it iust to condem a man befoir he be ather hard or sene.
            As concerning the iniuries quhilk faslie he aledgis to be done vnto him be that maist modest godlie and leirnit man Maister NICOLL DALGLEISCH. in that point he hes als leudly &amp; lounlie lyit, as in all ye rest.

            I pas of purpose many rayling words, quhilk be his vntamit toung he blastis out against Gods seruāts wt out occasion, for sic an obscure Harlot yai neuer thoght worthy to be namit from that place, And returning vnto those, quhilks ȝit with blawen cheakis, riftingly he speuis forth against me, specialy in braiding vnto me vnthankfulness as if yat I had maid guid cheir with him, in his house, thairby geuing to vnderstād how familiarly he leuith with them, quh
                  •
                hes zelously professed the treuth. I beseik ȝow (gentil reader) to haue me in this point appardonit, quhilk he wald haue importen sum misterie, seing for ye iustification of my cause, &amp; for ye discharging of my honour, I am forcit to discover yt quhilk glaidly vtherwise I wald conceal: &amp; vrgit to reuele mair than my modesty wald permit, or my honestye allow. It chanset me indeid at my first arryuing to Paris, for certen priuat busines, to seke a cousing of his in his chalmer. at quhat tyme he being at his parisien brekfast, offred vnto me sic coursly common courtesie, as na mā almaist without ruid &amp; vngentle churlishnes, can neglect. I being inforcit be his inportune requeist, dranke with him in deid, bot sa far frō ryatous surfetting and grit gluttonie, as I micht weil haue receauit my part of an vther disione, now seing he is not aschamed to obiect vnto me sic smal triffils, vnwordy to be rehearsit not sa mekil proceading of loue, as of common custome, thou may easily (gentle Reader) consider the mans nature.
            As touching the familiarity betuix him &amp; others of our religioun: I wald knaw quhither it wer of loue, or of hypocrisie? of loue he can not say, seing he professis him selfe a deadly ennemie to al them that steadfastly mainteanis the cause of God. And thairfor promisis to ꝓuide new mater to our Ministers, meaning thairby, to slaye hurte or persicute sum mā. Besides that commonly in his drukkin lawings, he brags bosts &amp; threatnis, that I sal be the last protestant, that euer sal lycht a candil in Paris. And thairfoir by necessarie consequence we may conclud yt it is by plain dissimulation, that this suppost of satan Iniyres him selfe in the companie of them that feareth Cod, wating thairby the occasion to cut thair throttis.

               AD This conclusioun is prouin because Christ has callit himself a Priest for euer efter the ordour of Melchisadek: we reid in the book of Genesies that Melchisadek offred bread and wine thairfor Christ being presigurat be Melchisadek of necessitie man hau anelyke maner of sacrifice to w

                     •
                   in Christs preisthood. Bot Melchisadek offred to God the Father bread and Wyne. Thairfoir it behouit Christ not onlie to offer that, bot that the veritie of the figure might be performit in his body and blood also. I admit the propositioun, and denyis the assumptioun, because that in the Epistle to the Ebrewes many conferences and dyuers collations ar maid of Melchisadeks preisthod &amp; of Christ quhairin na mention is maid of bread and Wine.ANS. To be short ye figure of Melchisadeks preisthood dois consist in tha things quhilks ar not comon with Arons preisthood; bot the offring of bread and wine, was dayly in the sacrifice of Aaron, thairfoir Christs preisthood rather suld be after the ordour of Arō nor Melchisadeks, if the offring of bread and Wine ware the principall things in Christs preisthood.NOTE Bot all this controuersy floweth from the ignorance of the Ebrew word, for in the 14 of Gene it is writin, that after Abraham returnit from the battel with his souldiers being werie, Melchisadek quha was King causit bread &amp; wine be broght furth quhairby Abraham and his armie micht bene refreschit. The same King also being hie Priest blissit him the error of our aduersar consisteth in this word (broght furth) quhilk be sum is exponit obtulit, bot wrang and be vthers as be Iero. pro

               AD. Of this we collect that tha quha lawbours to abolich the sacrifice of Christs body and blood in the messe ar blasphemous against Christ and his eternall preisthood after the ordour of Melchisadek.
