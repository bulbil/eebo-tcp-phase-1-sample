            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

¶ Vſe not the companie of a woman, that is a ſinger and a dauncer, leaſt thou be intrapped in her ſnares.

            To the right woorſhipfull M. D. Lewyn, doctor of the ciuil Lawes, one of the Queenes Maieſties high cōmiſſioners, and Chauncellour to the reuerent father in God, Iohn Biſhop of Rocheſter: Chriſtopher Fetherſton, wiſheth long life, happie dayes, and eternall felicitie.
            
               IF wee enquire of the times of old (right worſhipfull) and ſeeke out what hath been done in the daies which are paſſed: If we goe through that ſacred volume, wherein are contayned, the ſtatutes of the moſt higheſt, and the glad tidings of our ſaluation, and diligently 
                  •
               oate the hiſtories therein contayned: if we reade the auncient hiſtories wherein are recorded the factes of our forefathers, &amp; thoſe things which haue happened heretofore: wee ſhall playnely ſee

&amp; perceiue, yt they haue alwayes had ſome cloak in readines to couer eue their moſt abhominable ſin, to yt end it might appeare vnto mē, to be no ſin at all. When as our great Graūdfather Adā had tranſgreſſed the Law▪ which God had giuen him, &amp; violated the cōmandement of his creator, by eating the forbiddē fruit: being asked why he did ſo, he could quickly couer the matter with a figge leafe, &amp; ſay that it was y• womā which thou gaueſt me, which gaue it me to eate, where he hath no other to lay y• blame vpō, but vpō God himſelf. When Cain, y• murtherer, had ſlaine his brother Abell, being aſked of God where his brother was, hee coulde anſwere God very diſdainfully, &amp; ſay, nūquid ego ſū
                  cuſtos fratris me
                     •
                  ? am I y• keeper of my brother▪ When as y• I ſraelites would cōmit idolatrie, they ſaid they would haue gods to go before them into Canaan, for they knew not what was become of that Moſes which brought thē forth of y• land of Egypt, where they cloaked their ſin with zeale. When Ahab would haue Naboaths vineyard, the poſſeſſiō of his fathers, it was becauſe he would make a gardē of earbes therof. Whē as that curſed Ieſabel (whoſe life was lewd, &amp; death ſhamful) did goe about to haue Naboth ſtoned

to death, ſhee did caſt this couering vpō her pre
                  ••
               ce, &amp; ſaid, he had ſpokē againſt god▪ &amp; againſt the king. When as Saul had trāſgreſſed the cōmaundement of God, in not killing the Amelekyts, &amp; all that was theirs▪ he excuſed his fact with his good intent, and ſaid, he ſaued the beſt of the ſheepe &amp; of the oxen to offer in ſacrifice vnto the Lord. The Iewes would put Chriſt to death, becauſe he had tranſgreſſed their law, by making himſelfe a king, Caeſar being yet aliue. And Stephan was ſtoned for ſooth, becauſe hee ſpake blaſphemie when he ſpake the truth. Out of which examples we ſee that thing euidently proued, where of I haue ſpokē before. Now if we come nigher home, &amp; take a full view of thoſe times which are now, we ſhal plainly ſee y• the mē of theſe dayes are not behind their aunceſtors in theſe things, for they cā
               bring a thinne ſkin ouer their feſtered ſore, that it may ſeeme to be hole, when it is nothing ſo. The vſurer can ſay for him ſelf, that it is lawful for a mā to make the moſt of his own. The couetous man draweth this vaile ouer his ſinne, it is good ſauing a penny againſt a wet day, &amp; he whoſe teath doth go before his handes▪ ſhall neuer be worth one halfpenny.
            
               The fornicator hath gone to ſcho
                  •••
                with the Papiſtes, and there hath he learned this leſſon, Simplex fornicatio non eſt adulterium, that ſingle fornication is not adulterie, and this is his laſt refuge, when hee can ſay no more for himſelfe. The Drunkard can ſay that he is a good fellow, and ſuche are to be well thought on. The laſciuious Dauncer hath all thoſe colours which in this Dialogue are recited, and many more then theſe, to paynt his dauncing withall, that it may ſeeme to be golde, whereas it is but copper, that it may ſeeme good, whereas it is euill, and that it may ſeeme an honeſt recreation, whereas it is inhoneſt, &amp; of all thoſe which will ſeeme to be honeſt, vtterly to be abhorred. And now (right worſhipfull) as it hath been the cuſtome of all thoſe holy men (which liued in thoſe dayes when thoſe former ſinnes were committed) to pul away thoſe copwebs where with they couered their ſinns, that they might appeare as they were in deede: ſo it behooueth thoſe which liue in theſe daies, to pluck away the viſurs from the faces of their vices whiche raigne in theſe dayes. Which thing I

haue gone about to do (with what diligence I cold) in the laſt vice which I repeated whiche was laſciuious dauncing, ſithens it hath pleaſed God here to fore, and euen nowe of late, to ſtirre vp thoſe which haue ſufficiently refuted whatſoeuer could haue been ſaide in defence of theſe other vices. And though I may ſeem to ſome to haue enterpriced this thing more raſhly then wiſely, and more impudently then prudently, fithens there are a great many which might better haue taken this ſame in hand: yet the cauſes which moued me here unto were ſuch, that I thought I had better take this thing vpon me (though I ſhould doe it but ſimplie), then to let it alone, leaſt when all men do ſtraine curteſie, it ſhoulde be left vndone. It is not onely the common ſort of people which doeth render theſe reaſons for dauncing: but it is euen ſome of thoſe which carry ſome credite, and are of great countenaunce, which vſe to obiect as followeth. So that it is to be feared, leaſt laſciuious dauncing in time bee taken for a vertue, where as in deede it is but a vice, as it is nowe a dayes vſed. And nowe (right worſhipfull) the eſpecial cauſes which moued mee to dedicate this my ſimple Dialogue

vnto your worſhip, are two in number. The firſt was this, becauſe I ment hereby (not in any caſe reaching you your duty) to certifie you (in whoſe hande it is to reforme this and ſuche like vices in theſe our dioces) howe commonly this lewde paſtime is vſed vpon the Sabboath day, and againe, howe the miniſters of Gods worde are contemned, becauſe they woulde debarre the youth from dauncing, ſo that it is to bee doubted, that vnleſſe ſpeedie reformation be had, they ſhall vtterly be ſet at nought. To whom ſhall the ſeruant, who hath eſpied weedes in the fieldes complayne, if not to the maiſter whoſe the fielde is? And whom ſhold I rather certify of this thing then you, who hath authoritie to plucke vp ſuche weeds by the rootes. The laſt cauſe, but not the leaſt, which enforced mee to offer vnto you the firſt fruites of my labours, was, becauſe you are he at whoſe handes I haue receiued as much as I haue deſired, but more then I haue deſerued. So that I thought my ſelfe bound by duetie not onely to doe this, but alſo to praye vnto God vnceſſantlye for your worſhip, whom I beſeech long to preſerue you in life and health, and alſo to endew you

with ſuch graces, as ſhall bee neceſſarie for your calling, to the which God, together with his ſonne Chriſt, and the holy Ghoſt, 
                  •
               e all prayſe, glorie, and honour, nowe and for euer. Amen.

               AS Iron fornaces, doe not at y• firſt blowing ſend out the greateſt, nor yet the ſoundeſt ſowes of Irō, yet thoſe which are then caſt, are not caſt away: As out of the fineſt fountayne of water, there doeth not at the firſt iſſue out the greateſt aboundaunce of water, yet men doe not refuſe, but rather chuſe the ſame, if it be but onely (quia noua delectant) becauſe they are delighted in nouelties: ſo (gentle reader) authours do not at the firſt publiſhe eyther in quantitie the biggeſt, or in qualitie the beſt bookes: and yet are not they aſhamed to put forth theſe their firſt labours, ſithens niſi per principia ad ſummū peruenire non poſſunt, they can not come vn to perfection but by certayne beginnings. Which thing being ſo, doeth

not a litle encourage me, to publiſhe this poore peece of woorke of mine (which is ſo ſimple, that it is ſcant worthie to appeare in print) and alſo I am the more bolde to let it ſhow the face, becauſe I hope that the good and godly will gratefully accept the ſame, if it be but onely becauſe it is ſome teſtimonie of my good will which I beare towardes them. The ſeely ſhepheard hauing no better ſtuffe, preſented vnto a famous prince a greaſie bottle full of fayre water: the poore farmer hauing no greater ſtore, gaue vnto a rich Citizen his lande lorde, a fewe apples, and poore Conon, preſented vnto the king, a ſeely roote in token of his good will. All which did thankefully accept theſe ſimple gyftes, nothing reſpecting the giftes, but the good will of the giuer. Whoſe examples, hoping the godly will followe, in receiuing this ſimple gift of mine, I pray inſtantly vnto the Lorde God almightie, that it woulde pleaſe his diuine maieſty, to finiſh that good worke which hee hath begun in them, and that he will dayly increaſe in them that hunger and thirſt, which they haue after righteouſnes, ſo ſhall they be ſure to be ſatiſfied in the life to come, with the fruition of thoſe

ioyes which all thoſe ſhall haue which loue Chriſt and his comming. Which ioyes the Lorde God graunt vnto vs all, for his mercies ſake. Amen.

               Iu.
               I am glad to heare, that they be in bodily health, for truely I ſtoōde ſomwhat in dout leaſt all thinges had not gone well amongſt you, becauſe I ſee you walke ſo ſoberly in theſe goodly greene fieldes, which are not only pleaſant to the eye, but do alſo ſēd out ſuch a fragrant ſmell frō thoſe ſweet flowres wherewith they are adorned, that mee thinke they ſhould cauſe you rather to laugh then weepe, &amp; make you rather ſing then procure your ſorrowe.

               Iu.
               I pray you ſir (if I may bee ſo bould as to aske you) what thinges bee theſe which do ſo turne your ſolace into ſorrowe?

               Min.
               The firſt then of all theſe is this. When as I doe conſider with my ſelfe, with what great good giftes the Lorde God almightie, hath endued man, and eſpecially, howe he hath giuen vnto him a Pilote moſt prudent, to gouerne him vppon the ſurging ſeas of this mortall life, which is euen reaſon, howe hee hath giuen vnto him all thinges whiche are neceſſarie for this preſent life, how he hath made him lower then the Angels to crown him with maieſtie and honour, how he hath giuen his only ſonne Chriſt Ieſus to die for man, that man might bee deliuered from eternal death &amp; deſtruction; howe he hath ſuffered him to be ſet at naught, to the ende man myght bee

bought, howe hee hath ſuffered him to be payned that man might bee gayned, how he hath ſuffered him to be ſcourged, that by his ſtripes man might bee healed, howe he hath ſuffered him to be accurſed, that man might bee deliuered from the curſe: ſo often doeth it make mee ſobbe and ſigh, to ſee howe vngratefully man doeth behaue him ſelfe towardes ſo kinde a father. Agayne, when as I come nigher home, and looke rounde about me in this our Countrey of Ailgna, and doe well waigh with my ſelfe with what bleſſings the Lorde hath endewed vs aboue all other nations, and howe wee by our lewde and wicked liues doe more diſhonor him, almoſt, thē any nation vnder the ſunne:
               It maketh me to burſt out into bitter teares, and to bewayle our great vnthankfulneſſe. What nation vnder the heauens hath taſted of thoſe bleſſinges whereof wee haue had great abundance, or vnto what countrey in all the world hath the Lorde been ſo fauourable, as vnto this of ours:
               The heauens are not made vnto vs as braſſe, nor the earth is not vnto vs as Iron: but the cloudes droppe fatneſſe and

the earth yeeldeth her encreaſe, and yet beholde more bleſſings then theſe.
               Our oxen are ſtrong to labour, and our ſheepe bring foorth thouſandes, and tenne thouſandes, and yet beholde more bleſſings then theſe. There is no leading into captiuitie, neyther any complayning in our ſtreetes, and yet beholde more bleſſings then theſe. Wee haue a prudent Princes, a gracious Queene, a godly Iudith, a chaſt Suſanna, a vertuous Heſter, a diſcreete Debora, which theſe foure and twentie yeeres hath iudged Iſrael with equitie and right, and yet beholde more bleſſings then theſe. We haue ſage Senatours which take counſell at the worde of the Lorde in all their interpriſes, and do nothing without the warrantize thereof, and yet beholde more bleſſings then theſe. The Lorde himſelfe is our defence, and the God of Iacob is our protectour, and yet beholde more bleſſings then theſe. We are but an handefull in reſpecte of all other nations, and yet all other nations ſtande in awe of vs, becauſe we are in ſafety vnder the ſhadowe of the winges of the Lorde,

And this is the firſte thing O Iuuenis which cauſeth mee to be ſorie now, when thou ſayeſt other men would ſing.
               The ſecond thing which turneth my melodie into mourning is this: becauſe I ſee ſuch negligence in a great many of Magiſtrates (I had almoſt ſayde in all Magiſtrates) that ſinne is left vnpuniſhed,

and offences are almoſt neuer called in queſtion.
               Money which is gotten by vſury is counted lawfull gaynes, and men doe almoſt make an occupation thereof, ſo that I

                   ſpeedye reformation wrought) that y• Scriuiners ſhall ſpende one peny, nay, one pounde more by yeere, for making indencures for thoſe which ſhall be bound prentices to the vſurers. The adulterer braggeth amongſt his companyons, that although he haue watched all night, yet in the morning came he to his purpoſe: and ſo maketh hee no conſcience of ſinne, but is rockt on ſleep in the cradle of ſecuritie. The Papiſtes lie hiſſing like a ſnake vnder the greene herbes of curteous countenaunces, and there is no man to put thē to flight, ſo that the godly may ſtyll looke when they ſhall bee ſtunge. The extorcioner wreſteth and wringeth, to the ende he may augment his gaines. The rich mā ſtretcheth himſelf vpon his bed of euorie, hee eateth the fatteſt of the flocke, and the calfe out of the ſtall, hee drynketh wyne in bowles, and

ſingeth to the ſounde of the inſtrument, and regardeth not the afflictions of Iacob, nor careth not for the calamities of Iſrael. The poore cryeth, but hee heareth them not, the fatherleſſe complayneth, but he ſtoppeth his eares, and the wofull wayling of the widowe doeth not once make him wagge. Hee ioyneth houſe to houſe, and lande to lande, ſo that the poore hath not an hoale wherein to hyde his head. And are theſe all the abhominations whiche are to bee founde in Ailgna▪
                   no, no: there bee thouſandes more then theſe. Our Sabbothes are prophaned, the worde of God is obſtinately refuſed, the preachers thereof are ſhamefully abuſed, and yet beholde more abhominations then theſe. The name of God is blaſphemed, Maieſtrates are diſobeyed, good lawes are violated, and yet beholde more abhominations then theſe. Ahab will haue Naboths vineyard, becauſe it is good to make a Garden of herbes thereof. The rich man will haue the poore mans poſſeſſion, becauſe it lieth in his way, and the couetous man will not ſuffer the needie to dwell nigh him,

becauſe he can not abide the ſmell of his ſmoke, and yet behold more abhominations then theſe. Our faſting is tourned into feaſting, our mourning into mumming, our praying into playing, our almes deedes into all miſdeedes. High and lowe, rich and poore, one with another are lulled on ſleepe in the bedde of ſecuritie, and no man thinketh on the day to come. But it fareth with vs as it did with the men of Hieruſalem, for as they did not thinke vppon the time of their viſitation, vntill they were ſwallowed vp of their enemies: no more do we thinke vpon the iudgementes of God pronounced againſt impenitēt ſinners, god grant we may not taſte thereof as they ſometime did. Nay furthermore, as they did interprete euery ſigne and token whiche God did ſende amongſt them to call them home, for the beſt, euen ſo doe wee. When they ſawe blaſing Starres and other

               A ruine moſt ruthful, a caſe moſt carefull, an happe moſt harde, a ſubuerſion moſt ſuddaine, a deſolation deſerued, a deſtruction moſt due, &amp; example moſt excellent for all men to be ware by, that they do not commit the like ſinnes, leaſt they taſt of the ſame ſowre ſauce. I maruel we can

ſo often heare with our eares what deſtruction fel vpon Sodome and Gomorra for their ſinnes, and that we wil neuer be warned by them to forſake ſinne. The earth vnder our feete hath ſhaken, becauſe the Lorde was wroth with vs, &amp; the he auens from aboue haue foretolde our deſtruction, vnleſſe we repent. Our ſinnes are many in number; &amp; great are our iniquities, &amp; our offences are gone ouer our heads, and are become a burthē to. heauy for vs to beare. I am no Prophet, nor the ſonne of a prophete, I am no dreamer of dreames, neither yet an interpreter of the ſame, I was not nouriſhed vp in Nayoth, nor yet did I eate bread in mount Ephraim amongſt the chrildren of the prophets: &amp; yet when the figtree &amp; all other trees do ſhoote out their buds, it is a token that ſommer is nere, and when the fieldes are white, it is a ſigne that harueſt is at hand: ſo when ſinne is rype, a man may eaſely iudge that it ſhalbe cut downe. Wherefore I ſay once againe O Ailgna repent. Theſe, theſe are the thinges O Iunenis, which do procure my meditation, whereat thou doeſt ſo much maruell.

I pray you therefore aunſwere mee to this queſtion. You ſay that dauncing is a recreation, whether therefore doeth it recreate the bodie or the minde?
            
            
               Iu.
               It doeth recreate both, and for that cauſe mens ſeruants hauing laboured harde all the weeke, doe vſe to daunce vpon the Sundayes.
            
            
               Min.
               You ſay that dauncing doth recreate both body and minde, if therefore I ſhall prooue that it doeth recreate neyther of both, you will thinke your ſelf to be in the backhouſe ditch.
               
                  Can you de

               Iu.
               Not very well, I pray you therefore tell me what it is?
            
            
               Min.
               In this you bewraye your groſeneſſe and ignorance, that you will ſay you cannot tell what: You will ſaye that dauncing is a good recreation when as you knowe not what recreation meaneth. But it appeareth that this bolt whiche you haue already ſhotte, came neuer out of your owne quiuer, Recreation is a ſeconde making, or a making agayne of that thing which was once made, and by a metaphore we call it a refreſhing of that thing which is wearied with muche labour, (if it be applyed vnto the body): but if it be applied vnto the mynde, wee ſay it is a renewing of the minde beeyng worne with much labour &amp; ſtudie, greate cares, and vnmeaſurable ſorrowe. This definition being thus ſet downe, I come to that which you haue ſaide before, and I will firſt proue (if God ſhall aſſiſt mee) that dauncing is no recreation of the bodie, ſecondely that it is no recreation of

the minde. If dauncing were a recreation for the bodie, then ſhoulde it refreſhe the ſame beeing wearie, it ſhoulde make nimble the ioyntes, ſtrengthen the legs, make ſoft the feete, and finally, it ſhoulde bring the bodie beeing out of temper, into good temperature: but it doth none of all theſe things, therefore dauncing is no recreation for the bodie. My maior propoſition is certayne and ſure, for it is grounded vpon the definition of recreation, as for the minor it is no harde matter for mee to proue it, ſithence common experience doeth tell vs that it is true.
               For dauncing is ſo farre from refreſhing the body being weary, that it maketh the ſame more wearie. For I haue hearde tell of thoſe whiche haue daunced one halfe day for pleaſure, and haue laide in bedde two whole dayes for payne. Cal you this a recreation? if this be your recreation much good eate you with it, I will none. I doe omitte to ſpeake howe many haue beene lamed with dauncing, which in their youth haue bin ſuch dauncers that they were able to leape ouer logges, but in their age haue ſcante been

able to ſteppe ouer ſtrawes. I will not ſay what incurable diſeaſes haue riſen in many mens bodies, through the extreame heat wherinto they haue caſt themſelues in time of dauncing. I neede not to tell what agues &amp; ſhakings men haue caught by dauncing, ſo that they haue almoſt hin vndone by it: and yet for ſooth dauncing is a good recreation for the bodie. What leauines, ſleepines, and ſiuggiſhnes doth dauncing procure: Howe many mens ſeruauntes being ſet to woorke, do after their dauncinge dayes lie ſnorting in hedges, becauſe they are ſo weary that they cannot worke: Whereby their maiſters doe reape but ſmall gaynes. If maiſters (eſpecially thoſe which haue dauncers to their ſeruauntes) did well conſider with them ſelues what great diſcommodities doe ariſe vnto them by their ſeruauntes dauncing, they woulde giue the miniſtrels money to hold their peace faſter, then the dauncers woulde giue them money to pipe, and yet they ſhoulde be no leeſers by it at the yeeres ende.
               But nowe will I prooue in a woorde or two that dauncing is no recreation for

the mynde. All Philoſophers do graunt this in generall, yt 
                  temperatura animiſe, quitur temperaturam corporis: that the temperature of the minde, doeth folow the temperature of the body.
                   Whiche wordes doe ſerue very much to the ouerthrowing of your poſition. For if ſo bee it the bodie be made ſluggiſh, and ſleepie with dauncing, and altogether vnapt to doe any thing, (as I haue before ſufficiently proued) then muſt the minde needes bee brought into like caſe. So that you ſee, that whereas you ſaide that dauncing was a recreation both for body &amp; minde, I haue proued it to be neyther a recreation for the bodie, nor yet for the minde.
            
            
               Iu.
               You haue made a fayre ſpeake of it, it were great pitie but you were ſhut vp in a Cloyſter amongſt Monkes, you can leade ſuch a ſober life.
            
            
               Min.
               If I coulde not leade a more ſober life then they. I might well inough daunce, for truely the ſins which amongſt them are committed, doe farre paſſe your dauncing, and yet is it badde ynough.
               They are not ſober and holy, becauſe they ſeeme ſo to bee. They doe waſhe the

outſide of the cuppe and platter, but within they are full of deadly poyſon.
               They are like paynted ſepulchres, which on the outſide doe ſeeme fayre and beautifull: but in wardly they are full of dead mens bones, and all filthines.
            
            
               Iu.
               You are out of your text ſir, I pray you returne to it againe. Will you then admitte no recreation at all for thoſe which are labourors, &amp; take great paynes all the whole weeke in their vocation:
            
            
               Min.
               Yes that I will, and that ſuch a recreation as ſhall be acceptable in the ſight of God, and laudable in the ſight of the godly.
            
            
               Iu.
               And I pray you ſir what is that?
            
            
               Min.
               When a man hath kept the firſt part of the fourth commaundement, which is this, that hee muſt labour all the whole ſixe dayes, and doe all that he hath to doe, let him keepe the ſeuenth day whiche is the Sabboath day holy, vnto the Lorde. That is, `let him reſt from bodily labour, and let him attende vnto Gods heſtes, let him behaue him ſelfe as a true Chriſtian ought, and as it becommeth

him whiche will bee a good keeper and ſanctifier of the Sabboth day: ſo ſhall he finde recreation both for his body and alſo for his minde.
            
            
               Iu.
               Nay not ſo, me thinke ye cannot proue, that by this eyther the bodye or minde is recreated.
            
            
               Min.
               Yes truely both of them, for firſt and foremoſt it is a great recreation to a wearie bodie to haue reſt, for as the olde prouerbe goeth: Feſſum quies plurimum inuat, reſt is no ſmall helpe to a wearie man.
                   And truely this reſt he ſhall haue, if hee keepe the Sabboath according to gods holy will and pleaſure.
               Againe (if you doe well remember) I ſayde euen nowe, that that doeth recreate ye body, which maketh it more apt and able to do that which it ought: And truely reſt doeth this. For as we do vnbende our bowes when as they haue bin long bent, to the ende they may ſhoote more ſtrongly when as wee doe bende them againe: ſo laboring mē do grāt ſome reſt to their bodies, yt when mē go to worke againe, they may both bee ſtonger to labour, and alſo endure longer. As for the mind, who

ſeeth not that it taketh great recreation by keeping the Sabboth day aright.
               And to the ende I may better proue this to bee true: let vs briefly conſider what ought to bee the exerciſe of a Chriſtian vpon that day, wherein hee reſteth from bodily labour. He muſt repayre vnto the Church, where all the faithfull are gathered together, to offer vp their ſacrifice, euen that ſpirituall ſacrifice which is ſpoken of by the prophete Dauid in the 50. Pſalme: Which is prayſe, prayer, and thankeſgiuing. This done, he muſt ioyne with them in prayer vnto the Lorde, lifting vp cleane handes towardes the holy heauens, where dwelleth God, euen the father of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. Then muſt he giue eare vnto that whiche is red and taught by the miniſter, he muſt heare, marke, and learne, ſo much as he poſſiblie cā. If opportunitie ſhall ſerue, he muſt receiue the Sacramentes of the bodye and blood of our Sauiour Chriſt, and that woorthilye, and thankefully.
               Hee muſte meditate vppon that which hee hath hearde, when hee returneth

But in this point you doe not degenerate from the Papiſtes, who as they did ſuffer men to vſe all kind of ſenſuality, ſo did they neuer finde fault with this ſame vanitie, I meane dauncing. As they reaſoned from cuſtomes and antiquitie, euen ſo do you. But wee muſt not rēgarde what hath been done in times paſt, wee muſte marke diligently what God hath commaunded vs to doe, who was before all times. If the Magiſtrate ſhould gouerne as his fathers haue done before him, hee ſhoulde oftentimes doe iniurie to the fatherleſſe, and oppreſſe the poore widowe. If the preacher ſhould alwayes preach as his aunceſt ours haue done, hee ſhoulde ſometime deliuer falſe doctrine.

               If wiſedome did come vnto men by nature, or if knowledge were an inheritaunce like vnto landes, which did diſcende vnto the ſonne in like quantitie as his father had the ſame: then coulde not wee ſay that we are wiſer then our fathers: but for as much as wiſedom, diſcretion, &amp; knowlege are gifts y• come frō aboue, euē from the father of lights, with whom there is no chaunge nor ſhadowe of chaunge (as Saint Iames doeth teſtifie): we may boldely ſay wee are wiſer then our fathers, if it haue pleaſed God to beſtow vpon vs greater ſtore of knowledge and wiſedome then hee gaue vnto them. For wiſedome is not proper vnto gray haires, ſo that all thoſe which haue gray hayres muſt of neceſſitie bee wiſe, and they onely can be wiſe, and that they can alwayes bee wiſe: neither is knowledge knit vp in white lockes.

               Well then ſir, I perceiue you will be wiſer then your forefathers: but what ſay you to our Iuſtices will you be alſo wiſer then are they▪ It appeareth that they can like of daūcing, els would they neuer graunt any licences to minſtrels.

               I wil in no caſe compare my ſelf vnto thē in wit, for compariſons are odious: agayne, I know that they are called to ſuch high degree, becauſe of that talent of witte and knowledge, which God hath beſtowed vpon them aboue their brethrē, and I beſeech God dayly to encreaſe the ſame, that they may bee anſwerable in all poyntes to ſo high a calling. But nowe as touching theſe lic

                  nces which they do graunt to minſtrels, I anſwere, that ſure I am, that whatſoeuer they haue done heretofore, there will none of them (eſpecially ſuche as doe feare Bod, as I hope they do all) hereafter graunt any licence (if they do graunt any)▪ but they will put in this prouiſo, that if the ſayde minſtrell to whom this licence is graunted, ſhall pype or fidle vpon the Sabboath day, or any other day, to the ende he may procure

any laſciuious dauncing: or if he ſhall pipe at any vnlawfull time of the night, to the ende he may keepe mens ſeruants out of their maiſters houſes: that then the licence, graunted ſhall bee altogether voyde and of none effect.
            
            
               Iu.
               In all this you doe not anſwere directly to my queſtion, I pray you why haue Iuſtices hereto fore graunted licēces to minſtrels if they did not thinke that dauncing was lawfull▪

               Truely my friende they did not graunt licences to minſtrels becauſe they thought that dauncing was lawfull: but they did graunt them to the ende they might vſe ſuche ſober muſicke as might delight the eares of thē godly, and alſo ſuch as hath been vſed amongſt the holy fathers of olde.

               Min.
               I will in no caſe admitte laſciuious dauncing, and yet will I grant, that men muſt and ought to reioyce: but yet this reioycing muſt not bee in dauncing, nor in any ſuch lewde paſtime, but it

muſt be ſuche a maner of reioycing as is ſpoken of by the Prophete Ieremie in his ninth Chapter, where bee induceth the Lorde himſelfe, ſpeaking on this wiſe: Let not the ſtrong man reioyce in his ſtrength, nor the wiſe man in his wiſedome, nor the riche man in his riches, but let euerie man reioyce in this, that he knoweth me to be the Lorde, which do equitie, iuſtice, and iudgement.
               
               This is that reioycing which we muſt vſe, and if dauncing were ſuch a kinde of reioycing, I woulde graunt vnto you libertie to daunce, not onely on the Sabboath day, but alſo all the whole weeke. Againe, Saint Paule writing vnto the Phillippians in his 4. Chapter of the ſame Epiſtle, writeth thus. Reioyce in the Lorde alwayes, and againe I ſay reioyce. Where he telleth the godly where in they ought to reioyce, not in a bawdy pype or tabor, but in the Lorde. If you will daunce this daunce, not onely I but all the Godly will daunce with you.

               Marie ſir then God helpe vs if we muſt be ſo ſtrait tyed. I perceiue you

woulde haue vs to liue like Saintes: But I haue heard an olde prouerbe, that he which is a Saint when he is young, ſhall be a Diuell when he is olde.

But I tell thee playnely Iuuenis, that vnleſſe men doe indeuour them ſelues to liue like Saintes, (that is, to leade an holy and vncorrupt life) when they be yong, they may chance to proue diuels in deed. For both common experience, and alſo that ſage ſaying of the prudente Poete Horace tell vs this, that: quo ſemel eſt imbutarec

                   ſo that wee muſt ſtudie to liue vertuouſly in our youth, elſe wee may chaunce to bee vicious in our age, and then beware that wee become not very Diuelles as did Iudas the traytour.
            
            
               Iu.
               Tuſhe tuſhe, wee will haue our ſwindg while we be yong, age wil come ſoone ynough, and it will make vs forſake all theſe ſportes: and then will wee

be ſober and vertuous.
            
            
               Min.
               Beſide this that age hath his proper vices, yet doeth neyther age nor nature bring vertues vpon their backe. For vertues are habits, which are gotten by many actions of our owne, ſo that you are greatly deceiued in ſo ſaying.
            
            
               Iu.
               Well well, dauncing is vſed euery where vpon Sundayes, and will be vſed whether you will or no. Agayne, why are you ſo ſcrupulous and curious about dauncing, for I am ſure the Church wardens of vbique (vpon whoſe oth it lyeth to for bidde the ſame if it were vnlawfull) wil ſuffer both the minſtrels to play, and vs to daunce vpon Sundayes, ſo we do not daunce in time of ſeruice.
            
            
               Min.
               If you remember your ſelfe, you promiſed to lay ſuch groundworkes for dauncing, as ſhoulde bee ſufficient to vpholde the ſame: but you haue here ſet vp ſuch a couple of ſhoores to ſtay dauncing, as I do thinke will make me ſweat before I ſhall ſhoue them away. Your firſt ſhoore or ſtay is the lewdenes of the multitude, the ſeconde, the negligence of

Church wardens and ſworne men. You haue nowe payde it home. Well, haue a lifte at your firſt ſhoore, which is this, dauncing is vſed euery where, therefore is it lawfull for you to vſe the ſame. It is written in Exod. 23. 2. That wee muſt not followe a multitude to do euill. Which place maketh much againſt you, becauſe you ſee that it is no ſufficient excuſe for vs when we doe euill, to ſaye the multitude doeth ſo: and doubtles to daunce as wee doe daunce in theſe dayes is euill, therefore muſt we not daunce, becauſe the multitude daunceth.
               If your reaſon which you bring were ſufficient to defende dauncing, then ſurely God ſhoulde haue dealt very vniuſtly with the men of the old world in deſtroying thē for their ſinnes which were moſt horrible, becauſe there was not one of them which coulde not haue alleadged for him ſelfe, that they ſinned euery where.
               If your defence were ſtrong inough, then ſurely the Sodomites and Gomorreans had great wrong, for they might euerie

one of them haue ſayde for him ſelfe that their ſinne was vniuerſall, and did reigne in euery corner and ſtreet of their citie. If your poſition might ſtande for a principle, then ſurely Moſes did the Iſraelites great wrong to breake the tables of the couenant, becauſe they committed Idolatrie, for all of them might haue ſaid that they did eate and drinke through the whole hoaſt, and when their panches were well ſtuffed, they ryſe vp to playe.
               They might haue ſaid generally, that they conſented to turne their glorye, into the ſimilitude of a Calfe that eateth hay. They might haue ſayde, that with one mynde and one mouth, they badde Aaron make them gods of ſiluer, and gods of golde, to goe before them, for as for that Moſes, which brought thē out of Egypt, they knewe not where he was become.
               If your reaſon were ſounde, why did the Lorde plague Hieruſalem for Idolatrie, for their ſuperſ
                     •
                  ition, for their abhominations: for without doubte they coulde haue ſayde that it fared ſo euery where.
               But this was no ſufficiente excuſe for them, but the olde worlde

was deſtroyed with the diluge of water, the Sodomites were brent vp with fire from heauen, the Iſraelites were ſore plagued, &amp; Hieruſalem came to a ſhamful ende, this notwithſtanding that their ſinnes were committed euery where.
               No more can we alledge for our ſelues, that dauncing and laſciuiouſnes is lawefull, becauſe it is vſed euerye where, for it is contrary to the will and woorde of God as were all their ſinnes, wherefore that ſhoore beginneth to ſhake. It is not ſufficient for vs to doe that whiche other men doe, vnleſſe they doe that whiche ought to bee done. Wee muſt not doe that which is done, vnleſſe that bee done which God hath commanded to be done. Therefore away with that fooliſhe aunſwere, which men doe vſe moſt commonly to make when as they are reprehended for their faults, they doe ſo in all places.
               
               When as God had by a mightie hande and ſtretched out arme, deliuered his people (euen the ſonnes of Iacob &amp; Ioſeph) out of the lande of Egypt, hee ſtraytelie commaunded them, that they ſhoulde not doe as they had ſeene the Egyptians do,

neither ſhoulde they doe according to theExod. 18. 3 cuſtomes of the lande of Canaan, whether they went to poſſeſſe it: but they ſhoulde do according to his iudgements. Thou ſhalt not doe that whiche ſeemeth good in thine owne eyes, but do that onely whiche I commaunde thee. Uppon which wordes, Chryſoſtome in his oration againſt the Iewes, ſayeth thus: Of a trueth, that whiche is done according to the will of God, although it ſeeme diſpleaſant: yet is it altogether pleaſant and acceptable in the ſyght of God. Contrarywiſe, whatſoeuer is done beſide the woorde of God, and otherwiſe then hee woulde haue it done, though it bee as a thing acceptable to God: yet it is of all other the worſt and moſt wicked. Out of all which places wee gather this, that though dauncing or any other exerciſe whatſoeuer, haue bin vſed neuer ſo long. or thogh it be vſed in neuer ſo many places: yet if it be contrary to the worde and will of God, and forbidden by the ſame, it is deteſtable, and of all men to be eſchewed.
            
            
               Iu.
               Yea but howe doe you proue

that dauncing is forbiddē by the word of God.
            
            
               Min.
               We are commaunded by the worde of God to vſe ſobrietie, therefore wee are forbidden by the worde of God to vſe laciuious dauncing.
            
            
               Iu.
               Yet againe, here is a wiſe reaſon. The cowleſtaffe ſtandeth in the corner, therefore the Pope is at Rome: my dagger hangeth at my backe, therefore my ſtaffe is in my hande.

               In deede (Iuuenis) your reaſons haue in them no reaſon, but I will proue that my reaſons are framed according to reaſon.
            
            
               Iu.
               Do ſo then I pray you, but the Doctors doubt whether you can doe it or no.
            
            
               Min.
               My reaſon then is this. We are commaunded by the worde of God, to vſe ſobrietie, therefore we are forbidden by the woorde of God, to vſe laciuious dauncing. I proue it thus. Whenſoeuer any vertue is commaunded, all vices whiche are contrary to that vertue are forbidden: as for examples ſake, when men are commaunded to practiſe liberalitie,

they are forbidden to vſe couetouſnes, or to embrace prodig al
                     •
                  tie, and when we are commaunded to loue trueth, we are commaunded to hate and deteſt theft, &amp;c. Therefore when as we are commanded to vſe ſobrietie, wee are forbidden to vſe laſciuious dauncing.
            
            
               Iu.
               Yea, but howe doe you proue this, you are as farre from the matter as you were.
            
            
               Min.
               Laſciuious dauncing is a vice wt is oppoſite to the virtue ſobrietie, therefore, if when the vertue is commaunded, the vice be forbidden, ſobriety being commaunded, laſciuious dauncing is forbidden.
            
            
               Iu.
               You are alwayes wrangling with me with your Logicke, if I ſhoulde ſuffer you to choppe logicke at your pleaſure, you woulde make me belieue that the Moone were made of greene cheeſe, and that the crowe were white: but I pray you ſir, remember your promiſe.

               In deede if they doe willingly permit you to daunce vpon the Sabboath day, without certifiyng of thoſe whiche haue authoritie to puniſhe ſuche faultes, they can ſcarſely excuſe themſelues of periurie.

               Yea, but they are charged to ſee men keepe the Sabboath day holy, according to Gods holy will and pleaſure, and they are commaunded vppon their othe to preſent all thoſe whom they doe ſee to doe the contrary, ſo that vnles they doe preſent commen and laciuious dauncers, they can in no caſe excuſe them ſelues of periurie: for euen thoſe dauncers doe breake the Sabboath day, and that groſſely, as I haue ſufficiently prooued alreadie.

               In trueth this is their common anſwere, but whiles they ſay thus, they are like to Sainte George on horſebacke, who doeth alwayes ſpurre cutte, but hee doeth not ride a mile in a moone. They are ſtill preſenting, but whiles they may not preſent all, they wil preſent none at all.
               
                  But let them take heede to themſelues, for ſurely that God, who hath ſaide, that hee will not holde him giltles who taketh his name in vaine, wil lay this negligence to their charge, when as they ſhall ſtande trembling before his iudgement ſeate, where they can fee no Lawyer for money nor golde to pleade their caſe, where no ſhift wil ſerue, where no brybe wil be taken, where they cannot ſmooth ouer matters with lies, for there, there, the ſecretes of all heartes ſhall bee opened. Let them not thinke that God is ignoraunt what their doings are.
               Let them not thruſt them ſelues out of Gods fauour, becauſe they will winne mans fauour. Let them not looſe a great commodity, yea the greateſt commodity, becauſe they will purchaſe a ſmall commoditie. Let them beware that they doe not taſte of the puniſhment eternall, becauſe they will ſaue their neighbour from that puniſhment whiche is temporall.
               What ſhall this auayle them to winne the ſhel, &amp; looſe the egge? to win y• ſaddle, and

looſe the horſe? what auayleth it them to to winne the whole worlde and to looſe their owne ſoule: They ſhal be in fauour with men, but they ſhall haue no friendeſhippe with God, they ſhall here haue pleaſure, but after death paine, here ſhall they haue mirth and melodie but when as they are gone hence, mone and mourning, here ſhal they haue ſolace and ſinging, but when they haue left this life, ſorrowe, ſobbing, and ſighing: here ſhal they haue wealth, but when death hath done his meſſage, they ſhal haue want and wo, and all their weale ſhall be away. Therefore ſay I once againe, let them looke to their othe, let them not put them ſelues in hazarde, becauſe they will ſaue other men harmeleſſe. He that made the eye can ſee their dooings, and he that planted the eare can he are their counſells, and he that nurtereth the heathen, doeth vnderſtand their imaginations. Let them take heede and that good heede to themſelues, non enim ſapiunt ſi ſibi non ſapiunt: for they are not wiſe if they do not prouide for them ſelues.

               You haue ſaide meetely wel

in this, but nowe to returne to our former talke, I maruel very much why you ſhoulde diſprayſe dauncing, ſithence a great many haue gotten their wyues, and that rich wiues alſo onely by dauncing.

               The Papiſtes in times paſt, and nowe alſo affirme, that ignoraunce was the mother of deuotion: and truely it was the beſt much cowe that euer they did graſſe, it was the moſt profitable opinion that euer they did holde. For by this did they debarre the ſimple people from reading the woorde, whereby it came to paſſe that they could neuer eſpy out their iuglinge. But I doe nowe ſee and perceiue, that ignoraunce was the mother of all miſchiefe, that ſhee was the head welſpring from whence did proceede all errours, and finally, that ſhee was that boole from whence did ſpring all thoſe rotten branches of diueliſh, deteſtable, and damnable heriſies. For vnleſſe you had been ignorant of Gods eternall trueth, you woulde neuer haue ſayde thus.
               
                  If you knew who it is that bringeth mariages to paſſe, and knitteth men &amp; women together with an vndiſſoluble knot, which is holy wedlocke, you would neuer haue ſayde that many men doe get their wiues by dauncing. It is god alone and none but hee, whiche coupleth both man and woman togeather. He it is that hath determined before the foundations of the worlde were layde, who thoſe be that ſhall ſo come together. He is able to bring to paſſe this his determination without any ſuche ſecondarie meanes as dauncing.
               Therefore moſt fonde, fooliſh, and fantaſticall is the opinion of thoſe men, which doe thinke that dauncing was the onely thing whereby they came by their wyues.
               When as God did inſtitute the firſte mariage in paradice, hee did not ſende for a pyper or 
                     •
                  idler, (for they were at that time vnhatched) to play, y• Adam might daunce, and ſo pleaſe Euah. And is not God as well able to bring marriages to paſſe without dauncing, as he was thē?

His arme is not ſhortened, neyther is his power weakened, but he is able to doe as muche nowe, as hee was able to doe then.
               In his handes are the heartes of all men, and hee ruleth them as he ſeemeth beſt to his godly will and pleaſure.

               I count him but a foole, which being deſtitute, will goe to the dauncing place and playing oke, to chuſe his mate, and I take her to bee but a noddie, which lacking an huſband, will thither runne to looke for him with whom ſhe wil match. For firſt and formoſt, hee for his part ſhal chaunce ſooner to light vppon a wilde wanton, then on a mylde matrone, which will become rather a gadding Dina, which will bee running abroade to ſee the Countrey, then a ſage Sara, whiche will keepe her ſelfe within the doore of the tent, whiche will become rather a careleſſe graſſehopper, then a carefull

amite: hee ſhall rather chance to chuſe one that will bee a paſincoine then a chaſt penelope: he ſhall chaunce ſooner to win an whoriſh Helena as did paris, thē a vertuous Electra as did pylades: finally, hee ſhall chaunce rather to catche a faithleſſe Clytemneſtra then a faithfull philomela. Saluſt in his Catalinario writeth, yt 
                  Sempronia a certayne laciuious and wanton womā was taught to ſing &amp; daūce more elegantly thē became an honeſt matron: in which place he calleth theſe two thinges the inſtrumentes of lecherie. Out of which woordes we may well gather this, that they are neuer of the chaſteſt ſorte which do vſe laciuious daūcing, though I doe not altogither denie, but that thoſe whiche are nowe modeſt matrons, may ſometimes haue been dauncers in their dayes.
               And nowe as for the women, if ſhee chance to chuſe her huſbande in the place aforeſaid, it may bee that ſhee ſhal ſooner catche a ſpendall then a ſparer, ſhee may ſooner haue one which ſhall be amongſt all men rather reuyled then reuerenced: one which may bee rather an aduiterous

                  Agiſthus then a faithfull Vliſſes.
               
               
                  Gicero in his booke of offices writeth thus, that an honeſt and good man will not daunce in the market place though he might by that meanes come to great poſſeſſions. And in his oration which hee made after his returne into the ſenate, he coulde finde no more reprochefull name to call Aulus Gabinius, his mortall enemie by, th

               It was obiected to Lucius Aurona for a great fault, becauſe he had daūced in Aſia: which thing was alſo caſt in king deiotarus his teeth. Cicero anſwering for Murena, ſayeth after this ſort:
               No man daunceth being ſober, vnles peraduenture he be madde, neyther in the wildernes, neither at a moderate and honeſt banquet. The ſame Cicero vpbraydeth vnto Anthonie amonge other his vices, dauncing. Did the heathens thinke thus euil of dauncing, and ſhall not Chriſtians thinke much worſe of the ſame?
               Did the heathens loath it, and ſhall Chriſtians like it? did the heathens compt it as a vice, and ſhall Chriſtians embrace it as

a vertue?

               I will anſwere you briefly (god willing) to both partes of this queſtiō, &amp; that anſwere which I ſhal make to the firſt, ſhal not be takē vp at my foot, but I wil fet it out of y• ancient father Chryſ. who in his 56. homilie vpō 
                  Geneſis, whē hee intreateth of the mariages of Iacob, ſaith thus: You haue heard (ſaith hee) of mariages, but not of daunces, which dances he furthermore calleth diueliſh, in wt homely he ſpeaketh muche againſt dauncing. And amongs al other he ſaith thus, the bridegrome and the bride are corrupted by dauncing, and all the whole familie is defiled. And againe, in his 48. hom. he ſaith, thou ſeeſt mariages, but thou ſeeſt no dauncing, for at that time they were not ſo laſciuious as they be now a dayes. Furthermore hee proceedeth to ſpeake of the dauncing of the daughter of Herodias, and he ſayeth: At this day Chriſtians doe deliuer to deſtruction not halfe their kingdome, not another mans head, but euen their owne ſoules. And hee addeth, that whereas is wanton dauncing, there the Diuell daunceth alſo

with them. Heere maye you ſee what the opinion of this holy father is concerning dauncing at marriages. And as for the ſecond thing, whether we may not daunce vpon feaſt daies, I ſay flatly wee may not. For if wee ſhould, we ſhould be like to the Iſraelites, who ſate downe to eate and drinke, &amp; againe roſe vp to play: whereby we ſhould prouoke Gods wrath And indignacion agaynſt vs. and for as much as it is the common cuſtome in vbique, to daunce and hoigh vpon our Idoll feaſt dayes, let vs beware that the like plagues do not befal vs whiche befell them.

               Suche myrthe will I in no caſe admitte. Tobias called his friends to a feaſt, but wee doe not reade that they did daunce after dinner: and let vs followe the example of that godly man. If we be merrie, let vs giue eare vnto y• exhortation of Saint Iames, who biddeth him that is afflicted, pray, and him that

is merry, biddeth he ſing Pſalmes. Let vs therefore make merry in ſinging of Pſalmes, and Himnes, and ſpirituall Songes, prayſing and

ſo caried way, as they cannot ſport themſelues with moderate mirth, but the fling themſelues into the aire, as if they would leape out of themſelues. This then Iob ment to note a curſed mirth, and a mirth that God condemned. Whereby wee ought to take warning to reſtrayne our ſelues from ſuche looſe and wanton paſtimes: but

               In deede Dauid did daunce I doe not denie, but yet after I ſhal haue ſaide a fewe wordes, I will let you ſee that this can be no ſufficient warrant for your dauncings. As it is lawfull to ſing, and we doe vſe ſinging to giue thankes to God, and to celebrate his prayſes: ſo alſo by a moderate dauncing, wee may teſtifie the ioy and mirth of the minde. Such a kinde of dauncing was that whiche the maide us did vſe, when they did celebrate with ſonges and daunces the victorie of Dauid ouer Goliah. Suche a kinde of dauncing was that which Myriam the ſiſter of Moſes, and other women did daunce, when as they ſung a ſong of victorie after that Pharao and his hoaſte was drownued in the ſea. And ſuche was that▪ daunce whiche Dauid daunced before the arke of the Lord. But yet none of all theſe do ſerue for your purpoſe, for their daūces were far vnlike to yours wt you do now vſe. For their daunces were ſage &amp; ſober, but yours are light &amp; laciuious: their daunces were milde and moderate,

but your's wilde and wanton &amp; they made no mixture of ſexes in their daunces, but the men daunced by them ſelues, and the women by themſelues: but you in your daunces muſt haue women, or elſe the market is marred.
               Which thing is intollerable, becauſe that, that thing is an intiſer and prouoker unto wantounes and luſt. Myriam the ſiſer of Moſes; daunced not with young men, but a part by her ſelfe amongſt women. Neither did Dauid daunce among women: and the maidens which celebrated his victorie; daunced by them ſelues, and not among men. Wherefore you ſee, that this can bee now a
                     ••
                  antiſe for your dauncing, that you reade of thoſe in holy Scripture whiche did daunce, becauſe your daunces are in no point liken vnto theirs, as I haue ſaide before.
               For their daunces were a moderate motion of the bodie, whiche ſerued to ſet foorth and expreſſe the ioyes of the minde, but you in your daunces do friſke and fling like wilde coltes. And in you is verified almoſt that ſaying of Fauſtus in Mantuane, which hee vttered concerning

the laſciuiouſnes of the people of his time.

               Methinkes by you, you would haue men to daunce alone without women, there would be a wiſe peece of worke, how can wee daunce ſo?

               Perhaps you ſayd truer there then you were aware off. But well I can not tell, there were neuer ſo many whoores and theeues as there haue beene ſince dauncinge was ſo muche left.
               For when as dauncinge was vſed, then men &amp; women came abrode, and now they creep into corners, either to filtch or els to play the naughtipackes.

                  al your harte. I remember M. Latimer in one of his ſermons maketh mencion

of an olde man, who being aſked by the kinges Commiſſioners, what was the cauſe (as he thought) of Good win ſands, hee anſwered, the building of Tenterden Steeple, for hee ſaide there were no ſandes there before it was builded.
               And truely I may well compare your talke to his anſwere. I pray you, is the abſenting of menſelues from dauncing, the cauſe of theft and who oredome, or is that ſame naturall corruption, which raineth moſt chiefly in the heartes of thoſe whiche are moſt ſet vppon dauncing, the cauſe thereof? And where as you ſaie there were neuer ſo many whoores and theeues as there 
                     •
                  e in theſe dayes, when as there is ſo little dauncing, I ſaye you are greately deceyued in that, for there were

                  uer ſo many of that ſtampe, as there were in thoſe dayes, when as they woulde daunce euen at the Church dore, For where do lewde perſons ſo ouer meet together,

                   where haue they a more conuenient place to meete together, then at commen dauncing places? And where may noughtie packes better obtayne their wicked purpoſes

then when as they doe daunce till midnight?
            
            
               Iu.
               Will you gayneſtande mee in all thinges? what ſay you to maygames, will not they downe with you? mee thinks it is good that we ſhould daūce, when as we ſee all thinges ſo pleaſant in May.
            
            
               Min.
               If you doe thinke that I wil better like of your Maygames then I doe of other your common dauncinges, which you doe commonly vſe, you are much deceiued, and you haue caught the ſtaffe by the wronge end. For I am ſo farre from liking well therof, that I can like better of your common daunces, and yet the liking whiche I haue thereof is but a little. For the abuſes whiche are committed in your maygaymes are infinite. The firſt whereof is this, that you doe vſe to attyre men in womans apparrell, whom you doe moſt commenly call maymarrions, whereby you infringe that ſtraight commaundement whiche is giuen in Deut. 22. 5. That men muſt not put on womens apparrell for feare of enormities. Nay, I my ſelfe haue ſeene

in a may gaime a troupe, the greater part wherof hath been men, and yet haue they been attyred ſo like vnto women, that theyr faces being hidde (as they were in deede) a man coulde not diſcerne them from women. What an horrible abuſe was this? what abhominable ſinnes might haue here vpon enſued?
               The ſeconde abuſe, which of all other is the greateſt, is this, that it hath been toulde that your morice dauncers haue daunced naked in nettes: what greater entiſement vnto naughtines, could haue been deuiſed? The thirde abuſe, is, that you becauſe you will looſe no tyme) doe vſe commonly to runne into woodes in the night time, amongſt maidens, to fet vowes, in ſo muche, as I haue hearde of tenne maidens whiche went to fet May, and nine of them came home with childe.
            
            
               Iu.
               Belike they lefte the tenth for the perſon, becauſe they would depriue him of none of his right.
            
            
               Min.
               What was their pretence herein I cannot tell, but ſure I am, the fact was moſt abhominable. But are theſe all the abuſes whiche doe followe your may games? nay, nay, there be many

more then theſe.
               What mere madnes is this, that a man whome God hath endued with witt &amp; reaſon, ſhoulde put on a noddies coate, and feigne him ſelfe to bee a foole, and to be deſticute of both theſe moſt precious giftes? doeth hee not thinke that if the Lorde ſhoulde deale with him in Iuſtice, that hee doeth deſerue to be made a foole againſt his will, which playeth the foole ſo willingly? What a ſhame, nay what a ſinne is it for him, who wilbe angrie with that man which ſhall not call him a Chriſtian: to play the part of a diuel, who is an vtter enemie to Chriſt and al Chriſtians?
               But truely theſe two perſons, I meane your foole and your diuell, doe make manifeſt what you are when you vſe ſuche wicked exerciſes.
               By your foole (who is moſt commenly amongſt the thickeſt) men doe playnely ſee, that al the company are but fooles: and by your diuell you doe manifeſtly declare, that you doe followe the diuell and not God, ſo long as you are ſo idlely occupied. And this is to be noted that your diuell doeth alwayes leade the daunce.
               Manye moe are the vanities whiche

are vſed in your maygames, but tyme: will not permitte mee to repeate them vp. Yet this I ſay, that they are altogether ſo vayne, that the godly may pray thus, and vſe theſe wordes of the Prophet Dauid, when ſoeuer they bee deſit ous not to ſee maygaimnes, Turne thou away mine eies (O Lorde) leaſt they beholde vanitie.
               
            
            
               Iu.
               Good Lorde is the winde in that doore nowe? this is a marueilous ſodayne chaunge. I haue knowen the day when as you haue been as great a dauncer as the beſt of them, and when you woulde haue gone as farre to ſee a may game as another man, and are you become ſo ſober nowe? the Prieſt hath quite forgotten that euer he was clarke.
               Is dauncing worſe nowe then it was when you did vſe it?
            
            
               Min.
               This is your laſt refuge, whiche you haue to flie vnto, you are almoſt vpon the ſuddes, you are now in a maner at a non plus. When as you are out of matter, you beginne to rayle, and to obiect to me the lewdnes of my former life. In deed it is acommon cuſtome amongſt

men, to obiect vnto thoſe which haue forſaken vice, and be taken them ſelues to vertue, what thing ſoeuer hath beene amiſſe in their life paſt, nothing regarding what they are nowe: but yet hereby men doe ſee howe greatly they bewray their fooliſhnes. Shoulde not hee haue beene accompted a dolte, which would haue refuſed Paule the faythfull preacher, becauſe he had ſometime been Saule the ſeuere perſecutour? Shoulde not hee haue been worthily taken for a noddie, whiche ſhoulde haue reiected Matthewe the zealous Euangeliſt, becauſe hee had ſometime been an extorting Publicane.
               And ſhould not he haue beene thought a verye foole, who finding in thoſe comfortable pſalmes of Dauid, ſinne reprehended, and vices reprouid, ſhould haue alſo replied thus:
               Hee needeth not ſo much to finde fault with theſe vices, the time hath bin, when hee him ſelfe was both an adulterer, and a murderer?
               Was Peter neuer good afterwarde, becauſe hee denied his maiſter once?
               Was Marie Magdalene neuer honeſt,

becauſe ſhe had ſomtime plaid the whore? And now whereas you aſke me this queſtion, whether dauncing be woorſe nowe then it was when I did vſe it, I anſwere, that it was as euill then as it is nowe, but yet it did not pleaſe God ſo to open mine eyes then, as he hath done nowe, that I, might ſee mine owne follie. Sinne doeth ſo blinde the eyes of men, that they cannot ſee when they doe euill. It is not my vſing or refuſing of dauncing which maketh it good or euill: but the ſeeing of the vanitie therof then, and the ignorauce of the ſame then, made mee thinke that it was then good, and maketh mee nowe thinke that it is euill. Take mee as I am, and not as I haue been. A tree whiche hath ſometime borne euill fruite, may beare good, if his head haue been cut off, and a newe grafted in his place. A man that hath bin ſome time a vicious perſon, may become a good man, if this heade of vice be cutte off, with the two edgged ſworde of Gods worde (which pearceth betweene the bones and marrowe) and the good graftes of vertue bee grafted in

his place. The leapar is ſounde after hee is cleuſed. And though Naaman the Aſſyrian his fleſhe was through leaproſie as white as ſnowe, yet hauing waſhed him ſelfe ſeuen times, it came againe like to the fleſhe of a young childe: ſo, though the ſoule of man bee neuer ſo filthy and fowle through ſinne, yet if ſhee waſhe her ſelfe by earneſt repentauuce, and a ſtedfaſt faith in the blood of Chriſte Ieſus, ſhee ſhall bee cleane.
               And nowe (O Iuuenis) that I may turne my talke vnto thee, thine owne conſcience telleth thee howe lewde a life thou haſt hitherto led, howe frowardely thou haſt behaued thy ſelfe in the commaundementes of God.
               What great delight haſt thou taken in blaſpheming the name of the moſte higheſt: ſo that thou haſt thought it the beſte qualitie, and greateſt ornamente that a young man coulde haue, to rappe out othes one in the necke of another, for then diddeſt thou thinke thy ſelfe halfe a gentleman, when as thou couldeſt ſwere ſo luſtilie.
               
                  Againe, thou haſt thought the Sabboath day neuer better ſpent, then when thou haſt riſe vp earely in the morning to toſſe the potte, to bibbe, to ſwill and daunce til night. Howe diſobedient a minde haſte thou alwayes borne towarde not onely thy naturall parentes, but euen all thoſe whiche haue authoritie ouer thee? With what filthie concupiſcence hath thine heart been fraughted, and howe deſirous haſt thou been, to haue y• which was none of thine owne: Theſe are no ſmall faults (O Iuuenis) but they are ſuch offences as doe prouoke the moſt higheſt vnto indignation. Theſe are not parua peccadulia, but they be maxima peccata, they be not minor ſinnes, but they are euen ſuch tranſgreſſions as do pull downe the heauie wrath and vengeance of God vpon our heads. Therefore (good Iuuenis) let it be ſufficient, that thou haſt behaued thy ſelfe wickedly heretofore. Redeeme the time which thou haſt lewdly let paſſe, amende that thing which heretofore hath been amiſſe. Flatter not thy ſelfe in thy ſelfe, and ſay not with thy ſelfe, I am but young, and I ſhall liue many

yeres, and I will repent when I am old, for why, thou art vncertayne howe long thou haſt to liue: Thou ſeeſt as well the young as the old go to graue like flockes of ſheepe. Againe, repentaunce is not in thine owne handes, but it is the good gift of God. Hell, death, and damnation are prepared for the impenitēt after this life, &amp; in this life great plagues remayne for the vngodly, as ſaith the Pſalmiſt.
               Incourage not thy ſelfe to ſinne, becauſe thou ſeeſt that the Lorde doth ſpare thee: for as the Lord is mercifull, ſo there proceedeth wrath from him, and bee thou well aſſured, he will wounde the heirie ſcalpe of ſuch an one as goeth on ſtyll in his wickednes. Lay thy hande vpon thy heart, and caſt thy countes afreſhe. Awake out of ſleepe, and ſtande vp, and the Lorde ſhall giue thee light. Put off the olde man, and put vpon thee the new man. Caſt off the woorkes of darkenes, and put vpon thee the armour of light. Take heed, for there remayneth for impenitent ſinners, a worme that gnaweth the conſcience: and there is prepared for the wicked, fire, whiche neuer goeth out:

where is horrour, terror, weeping, wayling, wringing of handes, gnaſhing of teethe, continuall death, yet thoſe whiche are there doe neuer die.
               
                  Tantalus his apples, Siſyphus his ſtone, and thoſe rauening Harpyiae (where of the Poetes doe ſpeake) are nothinge in reſpecte of thoſe tormentes, where of the wicked ſhall taſte, vnleſſe in this life they doe repente. Wherefore I ſay once agayne (Iuuenis) come away from amongſt the wicked, and chuſe hencefoorth to leade a newe life: nunquam ſera eſt ad bonos mores via, the way to good maners is neuer to late.

               Oh howe am I nowe altered from my former eſtate, oh what a ſuddaine change do I feele in my ſelf, euen in a moment: I haue heretofore ſaid in my heart, tuſh, there is no God. I haue thought with my ſelf, that if there were a God, yet was hee ignoraunt of thoſe things which are done vpon earth. I thought I might haue committed ſin,

and God coulde not haue ſeene mee, If I had committed the ſame in the darke: but nowe I ſee yt he ſeeth as clearely at midnight as at noone day. Nowe I perceiue that the darknes and light are all one to him: and that there is nothing hidden from his preſence. I thought I might haue committed ſinne, and hee would not haue puniſhed me: but now I am afraid that he will preſently puniſh mee, ſo horrible are my ſinnes. Now do I perceiue that, that is true whiche you ſaide euen nowe, namely that the word of God is like a two edged ſword, whiche pearceth betweene the marrowe &amp; the bones. Oh what ſhall I do? now may I run vp and down vpon the face of the earth, as did Cain, for often times haue I in heart murdred my brother at football. Now may I goe hang my ſelfe, as did Iudas, for his ſinn was but one, but mine are infinite. What torments doe I feele in my ſelfe? I ſee before my face nothing but death and deſtruction due vnto me for ſinne, I am ſory that euer I led my life ſo lewdly.
            
            
               Min.
               
                  Iuuenis, as it is ye part of a good

and ſkilfull Chirurgion to applie ſuche plaiſters vnto the ſores of his pacient, as may be ſharpe coraſyues to cutte awaye the dead fleſh, and then afterwarde to lay to the ſame ſome more pleaſant ſalues: as wiſe Phiſitions doe miniſter vnto the diſeaſed at the firſt bitter drinkes, but afterwarde they giue them more pleaſant potions: ſo haue I hitherto (whiche I hope am come to cure thy ſoule) ſet thy ſinnes in order before thee, that thou mayeſt ſee the greatnes of thy ſinne: hitherto haue I depainted out before thee, God in his iuſtice, whiche both thinges haue been vnto thee I knowe as bitter potions: but nowe will I declare vnto thee his mercie, which ſhall be a pleaſant drinke. Though there bee in God the ſharpe vineger of his iuſtice, yet doth hee ſo temper the ſame with the ſmooth oyle of his mercie (which lieth alwaies vppermoſt) that it maketh a moſt pleaſant and ſauorie ſauce. Though hee bee a great, fearefull, and almightie God, whiche puniſheth the wicked: yet is he a mercifull Sauiour which preſerueth the penitent▪ Though hee wounde the heirie ſcalpe of

ſuche an one as goeth on ſtill in his wickedneſſe: yet at what time ſo euer a ſinner doeth repente him of his ſinnes from the bottome of his heart, he will put all his wickednes out of his remembraunce. Though hee bee that God which turneth man to deſtruction: yet is hee the ſame which ſaith, come againe ye children of men. Though hee bee that God whiche plagueth the lande for the wickednes of the people which dwelleth therein: yet it is he that maketh the ſinnes of the penitent, which were as red as ſcarlet to be as white as ſnowe. If we turne vnto him he will turne vnto vs: and he will be fauourable vnto vs for his great mercies ſake.

               O what great comfort doe I take in theſe wordes: but tell me I pray you, howe I may appeare before that great and fearefull God, whome I haue thus diſpleaſed? howe ſhall I craue pardon at his handes, or whereunto ſhall I truſt.
            
            
               Min.
               I will tell thee what thou muſt doe. Catch in thine armes by faith, Chriſt Ieſus thy ſauiour and redeemer. Caſt all thy ſinnes vppon his backe, for hee hath

made ſatiſfaction for them all vppon the croſſe. Creepe vnder the ſhaddowe of his winges: ſo maiſt thou boldely appeare before this great and fearefull God, and he will for his ſake pardon all thy ſinnes, and forgiue thee all thine offences, thogh they were mo in number then the heires of thy head, then the ſands of the ſea, then the ſtarres of heauen.

               Thou mayeſt playe Marie Magdalens part, who was as great a ſinner as thou. Thou muſt fall downe at Chriſt Ieſus his feete, and waſhe them with thy teares, becauſe thou haſt ſo grieuouſly offended him. Then muſt thou moſt ſtedfaſtly belieue, that he by his moſt precious death and bloodſhedding hath purged thy ſoule from ſinne. Then maiſt thou boldly apply vnto thy ſelfe y• ſweete ſaying of Chriſt, goe thy way, thy faith hath ſaued thee. Repent and be heartily ſory for thy ſinnes, and let not the greatneſſe of thy ſinne diſcourage thee: for Ieſus

Chriſt came into the worlde to ſaue ſinners. Beleeue and thou ſhalt be ſaued, belieue and thou ſhalt not be confounded. Giue thy ſelfe wholy to the reading and hearing of the worde of God: for it is the ſtaffe and ſtay of our weake conſciences, and by the reading and hearing thereof, doe we come by faith. Be thou feruent in prayer, which is an exerciſe moſt meete for a Chriſtian man.

Methinkes I beginne already to ſay within my ſelfe, vnto my heauenly father, father, I haue ſinned againſt heauen and in thy ſight, and I am no more worthy to be called thy ſonne. And mee thinks I ſee him already come to meete mee, and to receyue mee home agayne moſt ioyfully. Now do I deteſt daūcing &amp; al ſuch vanity, &amp; I am minded hēceforth (if God ſhall aſſiſt me) to flie from ſinne as frō a ſerpēt. I wil henceforth reſorte as faſt to Sermons, as I haue gone

               Min.
               The Lord God continue thee in this minde good Iuuenis, ſo ſhalt thou be ſure to come vnto thoſe ioyes, whiche neyther eye hath ſeene, neyther eare hath heard, neyther hath it euer entred into the heart of man, to conceiue how great they bee. Vnto the which ioyes, the Lorde bring vs all for Ieſus Chriſt his ſake, to whom with the father and the holy ghoſt, bee all prayſe, glorie, and honour, nowe and for euermore. Amen.
            
            FINIS.
