            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            ¶The preface.
            
               FOr aſmuch as amōges other mine allegations for defence of my ſelfe in this matter, moued agàynſt me by occaſion of my Sermon made before the kynges mooſt excellent Maieſtye, touchyng partely the. Catholique faith of the mooſt precious ſacramēt of thaltare, which I ſee now impugned, by a booke ſet furth, vnder the name of my lord of Cauntorburies grace: I haue thought expediēt for the better opening of the matter, &amp; cōſideryng I am by name touched in the ſayde boke, the rather to vtter partely that I haue to ſay by confutatiō of that boke, wherein I thinke neuerthleſſe no

                requiſite to directe any ſpeache by ſpeciall name to the perſon of him that is entitled autor, becauſe it may poſſible be that his name is abuſed, wherwith to ſet furth the matter, beyng him ſelfe of ſuch dignitie &amp; auctorite in the cōmen welth, as for that reſpect ſhould be inuiolable. For which cōſideracion, I ſhal in my ſpeache of ſuche reproufe as the vntruth of the matter neceſſariely requireth, omitting the ſpeciall title of the auctor of the boke, ſpeake onely of thauctor in generall, beyng a thing to me greatly to be me
                  〈…〉
               ed at, that ſuch matter ſhuld nowe be publiſhed out of my lord of Cātorburies penne, but becauſe he is a man, I wil not wondre, &amp; becauſe he is ſuch a mā, I will reuerērly vſe him, &amp; forbearyng further to name him, talke onely of the auctor by that generall name.
         
      
      
         
            
               
               The confutation of the firſt booke.
               
                  THis auctor denieth the real preſēce of Chriſtes moſt precious bodie &amp; bloud in the Sacramēt.
               This auctor denieth Tranſubſtanciation.
               This auctor denieth euil men to eat &amp; drinke the bodie and bloud of Chriſt in the Sacrament.
               Theſe thre denials only impugne &amp; tende to diſtroy that faith / whiche this auctor termeth the popiſhe to erre in / callyng nowe all popiſhe that beleue either of theſe thre articles by him denied / the truth whereof ſhall hereafter be opened.
               Nowe becauſe fayth affirmeth ſome certaintee: if we aſke this auctor / what is his fayth / which he calleth true and catholique / it is only this / as we may lerne by his boke / that in our Lordes ſupper be cōſecrate bread and wyne / and deliuered as tokens onely to ſignify Chriſtes bodie and bloud / he calleth them holye tokens, but yet noteth that the bread and wyne be neuer the holyer / he ſaith neuertheleſſe they be not bare tokēs / and yet concludeth, Chriſt not to be ſpiritually preſent in them / but onely as a thing is preſent

in that / which ſignifieth it (whiche is the nature of a bare token) ſaiyng in another place, ther is nothyng to be worſhipped, for ther is nothing preſent / but in figure and in a ſigne: whiche who ſo euer ſayth / calleth the thyng in dede abſente. And yet the auctor ſayth, Chriſte is in the man that worthely receaueth, ſpiritually preſēt, who eateth of Chriſtes fleſhe and his bloud reignyng in heauē, whether the good beleuyng man aſcendeth by his faith. And as oure bodie is noriſhed with the bread &amp; wyne receiued in the ſupper: ſo the true beleuyng man is fedde with the bodie &amp; bloud of Chriſt. And this is the ſumme of the doctrine of that faith whiche this auctor calleth the true catholique faith.
               Nowe a catholique faith, is an vniuerſall faith taught and preached through all, and ſo receaued and beleued agreablie and conſonant to the ſcriptures, teſtified by ſuch as by all ages, haue in their writynges geuen knowlege therof, which be the tokens and markes of a true Catholique faith, wherof no one can be founde in the faith this auctor calleth catholique.
               Firſte there is no ſcripture that in lettre mainteineth the doctrin of this auctorsboke. For Chriſt ſaith not that the bread doth only ſignify his bodie abſent, nor ſainct Paul ſayth not ſo in any place, ne any other canonical ſcripture declareth Chriſtes wordes ſo. As for the ſence &amp; vnderſtādyng of Chriſtes

wordes, there hath not been in any age any one approued and knowen learned mā, that hath ſo declared &amp; expounded Chriſtes wordes in his ſupper, that the bread did onely ſignify Chriſtes bodie, &amp; the wyne his bloud, as thynges abſent. And to the intent euery notable diſagrement from the truth may the more euidently appeare, I will here in this place (as I will hereafter likewiſe when the caſe occurreth) ioyne as it were an iſſue with An iſſue. this auctor, that is to ſaye, to make a ſtaye with him in this poynte triable (as they ſay) by euidence &amp; ſone tried. For in this point the ſcriptures be alreadie by thauctor brought forth, the leterwherof proueth not his faith. And albeit he traueyleth and bryngeth forth the ſaiyng of many approued writers, yet is there no one of them that writeth in expreſſe woordes the doctrine of that fayth, which this auctor calleth the faith catholike And to make the iſſue plaine and to ioyne it directly, thus I ſay.
               No auctor knowen and approued, that is to ſay, Ignatius, Policarpe, Iuſtine, Irene, Tertullian, Cyprian, Chriſoſtome, Hilarie, Gregorie, Nazianzen, Baſill, Emiſſen, Ambroſe, Cyril, Hierome, Auguſtine, Damaſcē. Theophilacte, none of theſe hath this doctrine in plaine termes, that the bread onely ſignifieth Chriſtes bodie abſent, nor this ſentence, that the bread and wyne be neuer the holier after conſecration, nor that Chriſtes

bodie is none otherwiſe preſent in the Sacrament, but in a ſignification: nor this ſentence, that the Sacrament is not to be worſhipped, becauſe there is nothing preſent but in a ſigne. And herein what the truth is, may ſoone appeare, as it ſhal by their workes neuer appeare to haue been taught, and preached, receaued, and beleued vniuerſally, and therfore can be called no Catholique fayth (that is to ſay) allowed in the whol, through and in outwarde teaching, preached and beleued. If this auctor ſettyng apart the word (Catholique) would of his owne wytte go aboute to proue, howſoeuer ſcripture hath been vnderſtanded hitherto, yet it ſhould be vnderſtanded in dede as he nowe teacheth, he hath herein diuers diſauātages and hynderaunces worthy conſideracions, whiche I will particularly note.
               Firſte the preiudice and ſentence, geuen as it were by his owne mouthe againſt him ſelfe, now in the boke called the Catechiſme in his name ſet forth.
               Secondly that about .vij. C. yere ago, one Bertrame (if the booke ſet forth in his name be his) entrepriſed ſecretly the like, as appereth by the ſaid booke, &amp; yet preuayled not.
               Thirdely Berengarius beyng in dede but an Archedeacon about .v. C. yeres paſt, after he had openly attempted to ſet forth ſuche like doctrine, recanted and ſo fayled in his purpoſe.
               
                  
Fourthely Wykclif not muche aboue an hundreth yeres paſt enterpriſed the ſame, whoſe teachyng God proſpered not.
               Fyftely how Luther, in his workes, handeled thē that would haue in our tyme rayſed vp the ſame doctrine in Germany, it is manifeſt by his and their writynges wherby appeareth the enterpriſe that hath had ſo many ouerthrowes, ſo many rebukes, ſo often reprofes, to be deſperate, and ſuche as God hath not proſpered and fauored, to be receiued at any tyme openly as his true teachyng.
               Herein whether I ſay true or no, let the ſtories trye me, and it is matter worthy to be noted, becauſe Gamaliels obſeruacion writen in the Actes of the Apoſtels is allowed Actes. 5. to marke, howe they proſpere &amp; go forward in their doctrine that be auctors of any new teachyng. But all this ſet aparte, and puttyng a ſide al teſtimonies of tholde churche, and reſortyng onely to the letter of the ſcripture, there to ſerche out an vnderſtandyng. And in doyng therof, to forget what hath been taught hitherto: How ſhall this auctor eſtabliſhe vpō ſcripture that he would haue beleued? What other text is therin ſcripture that encountreth with theſe wordes of ſcripture (This is my body) Wherby to altre the ſignification of them? There is no ſcripture ſayth, Chriſt did not geue his bodie, but the figure of his bodie, nor the geuyng of Chriſtes

bodie in his ſupper, verely and really ſo vnderſtāded, doth not neceſſaritly impugne and contrarie any other ſpeache or doyng of Chriſt, expreſſed in ſcripture. For the great power and omnipotencie of God, excludeth that repugnaunce, whiche mannes reaſon would deame of Chriſtes departyng from this worlde, and placyng his humanitie in the glorie of his father.
               I
                     •
                   this auctor, without force of neceſſitie, would induce it, by the like ſpeaches, as when Chriſt ſayd: I am the dore, I am the 
                     •
                  yne, he is Helias, and ſuche other, and becauſe it is a figuratiue ſpeache in them, it may be ſo here, whiche maketh no kinde of profe, that it is ſo here: But yet if by way of reaſonyng I would yelde to him therin, and cal it a figuratiue ſpeache, as he doth. What other poynte of fayth is there then in the matter, but to beleue the ſtorie, that Chriſt did inſtitute ſuche a ſupper, wherin he gaue bread and wyne for a token of his bodie and bloud, whiche is nowe after this vnderſtandyng no ſecrete myſterie at all, or any ordinaunce aboue reaſō. For commenly men vſe to ordaine in ſenſible thinges remembraunces of them ſelfe whan they dye or departe the countrie. So as in thordinaunce of this ſupper, after this vnderſtandyng Chriſt ſhewed not his omnipotencie, but onely beneuolence, that he loued vs, and would be remembred of vs. For Chriſt did not ſay whoſoeuer

eateth this token / eateth my bodie / or eateth my fleſhe / or ſhal haue any profite of it in ſpeciall / but doo this in remembraunce of me. And albeit this auctor would not haue them bare tokens / yet, and they be onely tokens / they haue no warrant ſigned by ſcripture, for any apparell at all. For the ſixt of John, ſpeaketh not of any promiſe made, to the eatyng of a token of Chriſtes fleſhe / but to the eatyng of Chriſtes verie fleſhe / wherof the bread (as this auctor would haue it) is but a figure in Chriſtes wordes / when he ſayd, (This is my body). And if it be but a figure in Chriſtes wordes / it is but a figure in ſainct Paules wordes / when he ſayd: The bread whiche wee breake / is it not the communicacion of Chriſtes bodie, that is to ſay, a figure of the communicaciō of Chriſtes bodie (if this auctors doctrine be true) and not the communicacion in dede. Wherfore if the verie bodie of Chriſt be not in the ſupper deliuered in dede, the eatyng there hath no ſpeciall promiſe, but onely commaundement to do it in remembraunce. After whiche doctrine why ſhould it be noted abſolutely for a Sacrament and ſpeciall myſterie, that hath nothyng hidden in it, but a plaine o

                  en ordinaunce of a token, for a remembraunce: to the catyng of whiche token, is annexed no promyſe expreſſely, ne any holynes to be accompted to be in the bread or wyne (as this auctor teacheth) but to be called holie, becauſe

they be deputed to an holy vſe. If I aſke the vſe, he declareth, to ſignify. If I ſhould aſke what to ſignifye? There muſte be a ſorte of good wordes framed without ſcripture. For ſcripture / expreſſeth no matter of ſignificacion of ſpeciall effecte. And therfore like as the teachyng is new / to ſay it is an onely figure, or onely ſignifieth: ſo the matter of ſignification muſt be newly diuiſed / and new wyne haue new bottelles, and be throughly new, after .xv. C. l. yeres in the verie yere of Iubile (as they were wount to call it) to be newly erected and builded in Engliſhe mens heartes. Whiche new teachyng, whether it procedeth from the ſpirite of truth, or no, ſhall more plainely appeare by ſuche matter as this auctor vttereth wherewith to impugne the true faith taught hitherto. For among many other profes, whereby trueth after much trauaile in contencion / at the laſt preuayleth, and hath victorie, there is none more notable, then when the verie aduerſaries of truth (who pretend neuertheles to be truthes frendes) do by ſome euident vntruth bewray themſelf. According wherunto, whē the two women contended before kyng Salomon for the childe yet aliue. Salomon deſcerned 3. Reg. 3. the true naturall mother from the other, by their ſpeaches and ſaiynges. Which in the verie true mother, were euer conformable to nature, and in the other, at the laſt euidently againſt nature. The verie true mother

ſpeake alwaies like her ſelfe, and neuer diſagreed from the truth of nature, but rather then the childe ſhould be killed, as Salomon threatened, whē he called for aſword, required rather it to be geuen whole aliue to the other woman. The other woman, that was not the true mother cared more for victorie, then for the childe, and therfore ſpake that was in nature an euidence, that ſhe lied callyng her ſelfe mother, and ſaiyng (let it be deuided) whiche no true naturall mother could ſay of her owne childe, wherupon proceded Salomons moſt wiſe iudgmēt, which hath this leſſon in it, euer where contention is, on that parte to be the truth, where all ſaiynges and doynges appeare vniformely conſonante to the truth pretended, and on what ſide a notable lye appeareth, the reſt may be iudged to be after the ſame ſorte, for truth nedeth no ayde of lyes, craft or ſlayte, wherwith to be ſupported and maynteined. So as in the intreatyng of the truth, of this high and ineffable myſterie of the Sacrament, on what parte thou reader ſeeſt traft, ſlayte, ſhift, obliquitie, or in any one pointe, an open manifeſt lye, there thou maiſt conſider, whatſoeuer pretence be made of truth, yet the victorie of truth not to be there intended, whiche loueth ſimplicitie, plainenes, directe ſpeache, without admixcion of ſhift or coloure. And that thou reader mighteſt by theſe markes iudge of that is here intreated,

by thauctor, againſt the moſt bleſſed Sacratment, I ſhall note certaine euident and manifeſt vntruthes, whiche this auctor is not affrayed to vtter (a matter wounderfull, conſideryng his dignitie, if he that is named, be the auctor in dede) whiche ſhould be a great ſtay of contradiction if any thyng wer to be regarded againſt the truth.
               Firſt I will note vnto the reader, howe this auctor termeth the fayth of the real and ſubſtanciall preſence of Chriſtes bodie and bloud in the Sacramēt, to be the fayth of the Papiſtes: whiche ſaiyng, what foundaciō it hath, thou maieſt conſider of that foloweth.
               Luther that profeſſed openly to abhore al that might be noted Papiſh, defēded ſtoutly the preſence of Chriſtes bodie in the Sacrament, and to be preſent really and ſubſtancially, euen with the ſame wordes and termes.
               Bucer that is here in Englād, in a ſolēpne worke that he wryreth vpon the Goſpels, profeſſeth the ſame fayth of the real and ſubſtāciall preſence of Chriſtes bodie in the Sacrament, whiche he affermeth to haue been beleued of all the churche of Chriſt from the beginnyng hitherto.
               Iuſtus Ionas hath trāſlate a Catechiſme out of Douch into Latin, taught in the citie of Noremberge in Germanye / where Hoſiander is cheife preacher, in whiche Catechiſme / they be accompted for no true Chriſtian

men that denye the preſence of Chriſtes body in the Sacrament. The wordes really and ſubſtancially / be not expreſſed / as they be in Bucer / but the worde (truely) is there: and as Bucer ſayth / that is ſubſtancially. Which Catechiſme was tranſlate into Engliſhe in this auctors name about two yeres paſte.
               Philipp Melancton no Papiſt / nor prieſt writeth a verie wiſe Epiſtle in this matter / to Oecolāpadius / and ſignifiyng ſoberly his beleif of the preſence of Chriſtes verie bodie in the Sacrament: and to proue the ſame to haue been the faith of the olde churche from the begīnyng / allegeth the ſaynges of Irene / Cyprian / Chriſoſtome / Hilarie / Cyrill / Ambroſe / and Theophilacte / whiche auctors / he eſtemeth both worthy credite / and to affirme the preſence of Chriſtes bodie in the Sacramēt plainly without ambiguitie. He anſwereth to certaine places of S. Auguſtine and ſayth, all Oecolampadius enterpriſe / to depend vpon coniectures / and argumentes applauſible to Idle wittes, with muche more wiſe matter / as that Epiſtle doth purporte / whiche is ſet out in a booke of a good volume amonge the other Epiſtles of Oecolampadius / ſo as no man may ſuſpect any thyng counterfecte in the matter. One Hippinus or Oepinus of Hamborough, greatly eſtemed among the Lutherians / hath written a booke to the kinges maieſty that now is / publiſſhed abrode in prynt / wherin muche

inueiyng againſt the churche of Rome, doth in the matter of the Sacrament write as foloweth. Euchariſtia is called by it ſelfe a ſacrifice, becauſe it is a remēbraunce of the true ſacrifice, offered vpō the croſſe, and that in it is diſpēſed the true bodie and true bloud of Chriſt, whiche is plainely the ſame in eſſence (that is to ſay, ſubſtaunce) and the ſame bloud in eſſēce ſignifiyng, though the maner of preſence be ſpirituall, yet the ſubſtaunce of that is preſent, is the ſame with that in heauen.
               Eraſmus, noted a man that durſt, and did ſpeake of all abuſes in the church liberally, taken for no Papiſt, and among vs ſo muche eſtemed, as his Paraphraſes of the goſpell is ordred to be had in euery church of this Realme, declareth in diuers of his workes moſt manifeſtly, his faith of the preſence of Chriſtes bodie in the Sacrament, and by his Epiſtles, recommendeth to the worlde the worke of Algerus in that matter of the Sacrament, whom he noteth well exerciſed in the ſcriptures, and the olde doctors, Cypriā, Hilarie, Ambroſe, Hierome, Auguſtine, Baſil, Chryſoſtom, And for Eraſmus own iugemēt, he ſayth we haue an inuiolable foundacion of Chriſtes owne woordes (This is my body,) reherſed agayn by S. Paule, he ſayth further: the bodie of Chriſt is hidden vnder thoſe ſignes, and ſheweth alſo vpon what occaſions mē haue erred in readyng the olde

fathers, and wyſheth that they which haue folowed Berengarius in error, would alſo folowe him in repētaunce. I will not (reader) encombre the, with mo wordes of Eraſmus.
               Peter Martyr of Oxforde taken for no Papiſt, in a treatyſe he made of late of the Sacrament, whiche is now tranſlated into Engliſh, ſheweth how as touchyng the real preſence of Chriſtes bodie, it is not onely the ſentence of the Papiſtes, but of other alſo, whom the ſayd Peter, neuertheleſſe doth with as many ſhyftes &amp; lyes as he may impugne, for that poynte aſwell as he doth the Papiſtes for tranſubſtanciation, but yet he doth not as this auctor doth impute that fayth of the real preſence of Chriſtes bodie and bloud to thonly Papiſtes. Wherupon reader here I ioyne with thauctor an iſſue that the fayth of the real and ſubſtantiall An iſſue. preſence of Chriſtes bodie and bloud in the Sacrament, is not the diuiſe of Papiſtes or their fayth onely as this auctor doth conſideratly ſlander it to bee, and deſire therfore that accordyng to Salomons iudgemēt this may ſerue for an note and marke, for to geue ſentence for the true mother of the childe. For what ſhould this meane, ſo without ſhame openly and vntruly to call this fayth papiſhe, but onely with the enuyous worde of Papiſt to ouermatche the truth.
               It ſhalbe now to purpoſe to conſidre the ſcriptures touchyng the matter of the Sacrament

/ which thauctor pretēdyng to bring forth faithfully as the maieſtie therof requireth / in the reherſal of the wordes of Chriſt out of the goſpel of ſaint Iohn / he begynneth a litle to lowe and paſſeth ouer that perteyneth to the matter and therfore ſhould haue begon a litle hygher at this clauſe. And the bread whiche I ſhall geue you is my fleſhe / whiche I wyll geue for the life of the world? The Iewes therfore ſtriued betwene theim ſelf ſaiyng: How can this mā geue his fleſhe to be eaten? Ieſus therfore ſayd vnto them. Uerely verely I ſay vnto you / except ye eate the fleſhe of the ſonne of man and drinke his bloud ye haue no life in you. Who ſo eateth my fleſhe and drinketh my bloud hath eternal life &amp; I wyl rayſe him vp at the laſt day. For my fleſhe is verie meat / and my bloud verie drinke. He that eateth my fleſh &amp; drinketh my bloud dwelleth in me &amp; I in him. As the liuyng father hath ſent me / and I liue by the father: Euen ſo he that eateth me ſhal liue by me. This is the bread which came doune frō heauen. Not as your fathers did eat Manna and are dead: He that eateth this bread ſhall lyue for euer.
               Here is alſo a faulte in the tranſlacion of the texte / whiche ſhould be thus in one place. For my fleſhe is verely meat and my bloud is verely drinke. In whiche ſpeache / the verbe that cuppleth the wordes (fleſhe) and (meat)

together: knitteth them together in their propre ſignificacion / ſo as the fleſhe of Chriſt is verelymeat as thauctor would perſuade. And in theſe words of Chriſt may appere plainly how Chriſt taught the myſterie of the fode of his humanitie / whiche he promiſed to geue for foode / euen the ſame fleſhe / that he ſaid he would geue for the life of the worlde and ſo expreſſeth the firſt ſentence of this ſcripture here by me holly brought forth, that is to ſay. And the bread whiche I ſhall geue you is my fleſhe whiche I ſhall geue for the life of the worlde. And ſo it is plaine that Chriſt ſpake of fleſhe in the ſame ſence that Sainct Ihon ſpeaketh in, ſaiyng: The worde was made fleſhe, ſignifiyng by fleſhe the hole humanitie. And ſo did Cyrill agre to Neſtorius, when he vpon theſe textes, reaſoned howe this eatyng is to be vnderſtanded of Chriſtes humanitie, to whiche nature in Chriſtes perſon is properly attribute, to be eaten as meate ſpiritually to noriſhe man, diſpenſed and geuen in the Sacrament. And betwene Neſtorius and Cyrill, was this diuerſitie in vnderſtandyng the myſterie, that Neſtorius eſtemyng of eche nature in Chriſte a ſeuerall perſonne (as it was obiected to him) and ſo diſſoluyng the ineffable vnitie, did ſo repute the bodie of Chriſte to be eaten as the bodie of a man

ſeperate. Cyrill maynteyned the bodie of Chriſt to be eaten as a bodie inſeperable vnited to the godhed, and for the ineffable myſterie of that vnion, the ſame to be a fleſhe that geueth life. And then as Chriſt ſayth, if wee eate not the fleſhe of the ſonne of man, we haue not life in vs, becauſe Chriſt hath ordered the Sacrament of his moſt precious bodie and bloud to noriſhe ſuche as be by his holy ſpirite regenerate. And as in Baptiſme we receaue the ſpirite of Chriſt, for the renewyng of our life, ſo do we in this Sacrament of Chriſtes mooſt precious bodie and bloud receaue Chriſtes verie fleſhe &amp; drynke his verie bloud, to continus and preſerue, increaſe / and augment the life receaued, And therfore in the ſame forme of wordes Chriſt ſpake to Nycodemus of Baptiſme: that he ſpeaketh here, of the eatyng of his bodie and drinkyng of his bloud, and in both the Sacramentes geueth / diſpenſeth and exhibiteth in dede thoſe celeſtial gyftes, in ſenſible elementes as Chriſoſtome ſayth. And becauſe the true faithfull beleuyng men do onely by fayth know the ſonne of man to be in vnitie of perſon the ſonne of God, ſo as for the vnitie of the two natures in Chriſt in one perſon, the fleſhe of the ſonne of man is the propre fleſhe of the ſoone of God. Saincte Auguſtine ſayd well when he noted theſe wordes of Chriſt, verely verely / onleſſe ye eat the fleſhe of the ſonne of man &amp;c. to be a figuratiue

ſpeache, becauſe after the bare lettre, it ſemeth vnprofitable, conſideryng, that fleſh profiteth nothyng in it ſelfe, eſtemed in thowne nature alone, but as the ſame fleſhe in Chriſt is vnited to the diuine nature, ſo is it, as Chriſt ſayd, (after Cyrilles expoſition) ſpirite and life, not chaunged into the diuine nature of the ſpirite, but for the ineffable vnion in the perſon of Chriſt therunto, it is viuificatrix (as Cyrill ſayd) and as the holy Epheſine councel decreed: a fleſhe geuyng life, accordyng to Chriſtes wordes: who eateth my fleſhe, and drinketh my bloud, hath eternall life, and I will raiſe him vp at the latter day. And then to declare vnto vs, how in geuyng this life to vs, Chriſt vſeth the inſtrumēt of his verie humaine bodie: it foloweth. For my fleſhe is verely meat, and my bloud verely drinke. So like as Chriſt ſanctifieth, by his godlye ſpirite: ſo doth he ſanctifye vs by his godlie fleſhe, and therfore, repeteth againe, to inculcate the celeſtial thing of this myſterie, and ſayth: he that eateth my fleſhe and drinketh my bloud, dwelleth in me and I in him, whiche is the natural and corporal vnion, betwene vs and Chriſt. Wherupō foloweth, that as Chriſt is naturally in his father, and his father in him: ſo he that eateth verely the fleſhe of Chriſt, he is by nature in Chriſt, and Chriſt is naturally in him, and the worthy receauer, hath life encreaſed,

augmented, and confirmed by the participacion of the fleſhe of Chriſte. And becauſe of thin effable vnion of the two natures, Chriſt ſayd: This is the foode that came doune / frō heauen, becauſe God, whoſe proper fleſhe it is, came downe from heauen, and hath an other vertue, then Manna had, becauſe this geueth life to them that worthely receaue it: whiche Manna, beyng but a figure therof, did not, but beyng in this foode Chriſtes verie fleſhe inſeperably vnite to the godhed, the ſame is of ſuche efficacie, as he that worthely eateth of it, ſhall liue for euer. And thus I haue declared the ſence of Chriſtes wordes, brought forth out of the Goſpell of Sainct Iohn. Wherby appeareth, how euidentely they ſet forth the doctrine of the myſterie of the eatyng of Chriſtes fleſhe &amp; drinkyng his bloud in the Sacrament, whiche muſt nedes be vnderſtanded of a corporall eatyng, as Chriſt did after ordre, in thinſtitucion of the ſayd Sacrament, accordyng to his promiſe and doctrine here declared.
               Now, where thauctor to exclude the myſterie of corporall manducacion, bryngeth forth of Sainct Auguſtine, ſuche wordes as entreat of theffect and operacion of the worthy receauyng of the Sacrament: the handelyng is not ſo ſyncere, as this matter requireth. For as hereafter ſhalbe intreated, that is not worthely and well done, may, becauſe

the principall entent fayleth, be called nor done, as ſo Sainct Auguſtine ſayth. Let him not thinke, to eat the bodie of Chriſt, that dwelleth not in Chriſt, not becauſe the body of Chriſt is not receaued, whiche by Sainct Auguſtines mynde, euill men do to their condempnacion, but becauſe theffecie of life fayleth. And ſo thauctor by ſleight, to exclud the corporall manducacion of Chriſtes moſt precious bodie, vttreth ſuche wordes as myght ſounde Chriſt to haue taught, the dwellyng in Chriſt to be an eatyng, whiche dwellyng may be without this corporal manducacion, in him that can not attaine the vſe of it, and dwellyng in Chriſt is an effecte of the worthy manducacion, and not the manducacion it ſelfe, whiche Chriſt doth ordre to be practiſed, in the mooſt precious Sacrament inſtitute in his ſupper. Here thou reader mayſt ſee, how this doctrine of Chriſt, as I haue declared it, openeth the corporall manducacion of his mooſt holie fleſhe, and drinkyng of his mooſt precious bloud, whiche he gaue in his ſupper vnder the formes of bread and wyne.
               Nowe let vs conſidre the textes of the Euangeliſtes, and Sainct Paule, whiche be brought in by thauctor as foloweth.
               Whē they wee catyng, Ieſus toke bread, Mat. 26 and when he had geuē thankes, he brake it, gaue it to his diſciples, and ſayd: Take, eat,

this is my bodie. And he toke the cup, and when he had geuen thankes, he gaue it to them, ſaiyng: drinke ye all of this, for this is my bloud of the new teſtament, that is ſhed for many, for the remiſſion of ſynnes. But I ſay vnto you, I wyll not drinke henceforth, of this frute of the vine, vntill that daye, when I ſhall drinke it new with you in my fathers kingdome.
               As they did eat, Ieſus toke bread, and Mar. 14 when he had bleſſed, he brake it, and gaue it to them, &amp; ſayd: Take, eat, This is my bodie, &amp; taking the cup, whē he had geuē thankes, he gaue it to them, and they dranke of it. And he ſaid to them, This is my bloud of the new Teſtament, whiche is ſhed for many. Uerely I ſay vnto you, I will drinke no more of the frute of the vine, vntill that daye, that I drinke it newe in the kyngdome of God.
               When the houre was come, he ſat doune, Luc. 22. and the .xij. Apoſtels with him: And he ſayd vnto them I haue greatly deſired to eat this Paſcha with you before I ſuffre. For I ſay vnto you henceforth, I will not eat of it any more, vntill it be fulfylled in the kyngdome of God. And he toke the cup, and gaue thankes, and ſayd: Take this and deuide it among you. For I ſay vnto you, I will not drinke, of the frute of the vine, vntill the kyngdome of God come And he toke bread and whē he had geuen thankes,

he brake it and gaue it vnto them ſaiynge: This is my bodie, whiche is geuen for you: This do in remēbrance of me. Likewiſe alſo, when he had ſupped, he toke the cup, ſaiyng: This cup, is the new Teſtamēt, in my bloud which is ſhed for you.
               Is not the cuppe of bleſſyng, whiche we 1. Cor. 10 bleſſe, a communion of the bloud of Chriſt? Is not the bread, whiche we breake, a communion of the bodie of Chriſt: We beyng many are one bread, and one bodie, for we are all partakers of one bread and of one cuppe.
               That whiche I deliuered vnto you, I 1. Cor. 11 receaued of the Lord. For the Lorde Ieſus, the ſame night, in the whiche he was betrayed, toke bread, and when he had geuen thankes, he brake it and ſayd: Take eate, this is my bodie whiche is broken for you: do this in remembraunce of me. Likewiſe alſo, he toke the cup when ſupper was done, ſaiyng: This cup, is the new Teſtament in my bloud: do this, as often as ye drinke it, in remembraunce of me: For as often as you ſhall eate this bread &amp; drinke of this cup, ye ſhew forth the Lordes death till he come, wherfore, whoſoeuer ſhall eat of this bread, or drinke of this cuppe vnworthely, ſhalbe giltie of the bodie and bloud of the Lorde. But let a man examine him ſelfe, and ſo eat of the bread, and drinke of the cup, for he that eateth, &amp; drynketh vnworthely, eateth

and drynketh his owne damnacion, becauſe he maketh no difference of the Lordes bodie: For this cauſe, many are weake and ſycke among you, and many do ſlepe.
               After theſe textes brought in, thauctor doth in the fourth chapter, begyn to trauers Chriſtes intent, that he intēded not by theſe wordes (This is my bodie) to make the bread his body: but to ſignify, that ſuche as receiue that worthely, be membres of Chriſtes bodie. The Catholique church acknowlegyng Chriſt to be verie God and verie man, hath frō the beginnyng of theſe textes of ſcripture cōfeſſed truely Chriſtes intent, and effectual myraculous woorke, to make the bread his body, and the wyne his bloud, to be verely meate, &amp; verely drinke, vſyng therin his humanitie wherwith to fead vs, as he vſed the ſame, wherwith to redeame vs, &amp; as he doth ſanctify vs by his holy ſpirite, ſo to ſanctify vs by his holy diuine fleſhe and bloud, and as life is renewed in vs by the gift of Chriſts holy ſpirite: ſo life to be encreaſed in vs, by the gift of his holy fleſhe. So as he that beleueth in Chriſt, and receaueth the Sacrament of beleif, whiche is baptiſme, receiueth really Chriſtes ſpirite: So he, that hauyng Chriſts ſpirite, receaueth alſo the Sacrament of Chriſtes bodie and bloud: doth really receaue in the ſame, and alſo effectually Chriſtes verie bodie and bloud. And therfore Chriſt in thinſtitucion of this Sacramēt

ſayd, deliueryng that he conſecrated: This is my bodie. &amp;c. And likewiſe of the cuppe: This is my bloud. And although, to mans reaſon it ſemeth ſtraunge, that Chriſt ſtandyng or ſittyng at the table, ſhould deliuer them his bodie to be eaten: yet when we remembre Chriſt to be verie God, we muſte graunt him omnipotent, and by reaſon therof, repreſſe in oure thoughtes, all imaginacions how it might be, and conſidre Chriſtes intent, by his will preached vnto vs by ſcriptures, and beleued vniuerſally in his church. But if it may now be thought ſemely for vs to be ſo boulde, in ſo high a myſterie, to begynne to diſcuſſe Chriſtes intent: what ſhould moue vs to thinke that Chriſt would vſe ſo many wordes, without effectuall and reall ſignificacion, as be reherſed touchyng the myſterie of this Sacrament?
               Firſt, in the .vi. of Iohn, whan Chriſt had taught of the eatyng of him, beyng the bread deſcended from heauen, and declaring, that eating to ſignify beleuing, wherat was no murmuryng, that then he ſhould entre to ſpeake of geuyng of his fleſhe to be eaten, and his bloud to be dronken, and to ſay he would geue a bread, that is his fleſhe, whiche he would geue for the life of the worlde. In whiche wordes, Chriſt maketh mention of two giftes, and therfore

as he is truth, muſt needes intend to fulfill them both. And therfore, as we beleue the gift of his fleſhe, to the Iewes to bee crucified: So we muſt beleue, the gift of his fleſhe to be eaten, &amp; of that gift, lyuerie and ſeiſme (as we ſay) to be made of him, that is in his ꝓmiſes faithful, as Chriſt is to be made in both. And therfore (whan he ſayd in his ſupper): Take / eat / This is my bodie: he muſt nedes intend plainely, as his wordes of promiſe required, &amp; theſe woordes in his ſupper purport to geue as really then his bodie to be eaten of vs, as he gaue his bodie in dede to be crucified for vs, aptely neuertheleſſe and conueniently for eche effect, and therfore in maner of geuyng diuerſely, but in the ſubſtaunce of the ſame geuen, to be as his wordes beare wytnes the ſame / and therfore ſayd. This is my bodie, that ſhalbe berrayed for you, expreſſyng alſo the vſe whē he ſayd (Take / eat) which wordes, in deliueryng of materiall bread, had been ſuperfluous. For what ſhould men do with bread, when they take it, but eat it? ſpecially when it is broken? But as (Cyrill ſaith) Chriſte opened there vnto thē the practiſe of that doctrine he ſpake of in the .vi. of Sainct Iohn / &amp; becauſe he ſayd, he would geue his fleſhe for foode, whiche he would geue for the life of the worlde: he for fulfillyng of his promiſe ſayd: Take / eate, this is my bodie / whiche wordes haue been taught, &amp; beleued

to be of effecte and operatorie / and Chriſte vnder the forme of bread to haue been, his verie bodie. Accordyng wherunto (S. Paule noreth) the receauer to be giltie, when he doth not eſteme it our Lordes bodie / wherwith it pleaſeth Chriſt to fede ſuch as be in him regenerate, to thintente that as man was redemed by Chriſt, ſufferyng in the nature of his humanitie: ſo to purchace for man the kingdome of heauen / ioſte by Adams fall. Euen likewiſe in the nature of the ſame humanitic, giuyng it to be eaten to noriſhe man &amp; make him ſtrong to walke and continue his iorney, to emoye that kingdome. And therfore to ſet forth liuely vnto vs the communication of the ſubſtance of Chriſtes moſt precious bodie in the Sacrament, and the ſame to be in dede deliuered: Chriſt vſed plaine wordes / teſtified by the Euāgeliſtes. S. Paule alſo reherſed the ſame wordes in the ſame plain termes in the .xi. to the Corinthians / and in the tenth, geuyng (as it were) an expoſion of theffecte, vſeth the ſame propre wordes declaryng theffecte to be the cō
                  municatiō of Chriſtes bodie and bloud. And one thing is notable touching the ſcripture / that in ſuche notable ſpeaches vttered by Chriſt, as might haue an ambiguitie, the Euangeliſtes by ſome circumſtaunce declared it, or ſome tyme opened it by plaine interpretacion, as when Chriſt ſayd / he would diſſolue the temple, and within three daies

buylde it againe: The Euāgtliſtes by and by addeth for interpretaciō: This he ſaid of the temple of his bodie. And when Chriſte ſayd / he is Helias, and I am the true vine: the circumſtaunce of the text openeth the ambiguitie. But to ſhew that Chriſt ſhould not meane of his verie bodie when he ſo ſpake: Neither S. Paule after, ne the Euāgtliſtes in the place, adde any wordes or circumſtaū
                  ces, wherby to take away the propre ſignificacion of the wordes (bodie) and (bloud) ſo as the ſame might ſame not in dede geuē (as the Catholique faith reacheth) but in ſignificacion as thauctor would haue it. For as for the wordes of Chriſt: The ſpirit geueth life (the fleſhe profiteth nothing) be to declare the two natures in Chriſt eche in their propertie apart conſidered, but not as they be in Chriſtes perſō vnited, the myſterie of which vniō, ſuche as beleued not Chriſt to be God could not conſider, and yet to inſinuate that vnto them, Chriſt made mention of his deſcenſion from heauen, and after of his aſcenſion thither againe, wherby they might vnderſtand him verie God, whoſe fleſhe taken in the virgyns wombe, and ſo geuen ſpiritually to be eaten of vs (as I haue before opened, viuiſike and geueth life. And this ſhall ſuffice here, to ſhew how Chriſtes intēt was to geue verely (as he did in dede) his precious bodie and bloud to be eaten and drunken, accordyng as he taught thē to be verely

meat and drinke, and yet gaue and geueth them ſo vnder fourme of viſible creatures to vs, as we may conueniently, and without horror of our nature receaue thē, Chriſt therin condiſcendyng to our infirmitie. As for ſuch other wranglyng, as is made in the vnderſtandyng of the wordes of Chriſt, ſhall after be ſpoken of, by further occaſion.
               The auctor vttereth a great meny wordes, from the .viii. to the .xvii. chapter of the firſt booke, declaryng ſpirituall hungre and thurſt and the releuyng of the ſame by ſpirituall feadyng in Chriſt, and of Chriſt, as we conſtantly beleue in him, to the confirmaciō of which beleif the auctor would haue the Sacramentes of Baptiſme, and of the bodie and bloud of Chriſt to be adminicles (as it were) and that we by them be preched vnto, as in water, bread and wyne, and by them all our ſences (as it were) ſpoken vnto, or proprely touched, whiche matter in the groſſe, although ther be ſome wordes by the way not tollerable, yet if thoſe wordes ſet apart, the ſame were in the ſumme graunted, to be good teachyng and holeſome exhorcacion, it conteyneth ſo no more but good matter, not well applyed. For the Catholique churche / that profeſſeth the truth of the preſence of Chriſtes bodie in the Sacrament, would therewith vſe that declaration of hungre of Chriſt / and

that ſpirituall refreſhyng in Chriſte, with the effect of Chriſtes paſſion and death, and the ſame to be thonely meane of mans regeneracion, and feadyng alſo, with the differences, of that feadyng frō bodiely feadyng for continuyng this yearthly life. But this toucheth not the principal point that ſhould be entreated. Whether Chriſt ſo ordered to fede ſuche as be regenerate in him, to geue to them in the Sacrament, the ſame his bodie, that he gaue to be crucified for vs. The good man is fedde by faith, and by the merites of Chriſtes paſſion, beyng the meane of the gift of that faith, &amp; other giftes alſo, and by the ſufferyng of the bodie of Chriſt, &amp; ſheddynge of his mooſt precyous bloud on thaultar of the Croſſe: whiche worke and paſſion of Chriſt is preached vnto vs / by wordes and ſacramentes, and the ſame doctrine receiued of vs by faith / &amp; the effecte of it alſo. And thus farre goeth the doctrine of this auctor.
               But the Catholique teachyng, by the ſcriptures, goth futher, confeſſing Chriſt to feade ſuch as be regenerate in him, not onely by his bodie and bloud: but alſo with his bodie and bloud deliuered in this ſacrament by him in dede to vs, whiche the faythfull, by his inſtitucion and commaundement, receiue with their faith and with their mouth alſo, and with thoſe ſpecyall deynties, be fed ſpecially at Chriſtes table. And ſo God doth not onely preach in his ſacraments, but

alſo worketh in them, and with them, and in ſenſible thynges geueth celeſtiall giftes, after the doctrine of eche ſacrament, as in baptiſme the ſpirite of Chriſt, and in the ſacrament of thaultar, the verie bodie &amp; bloud of Chriſte, accordyng to the plaine ſence of his woordes whiche he ſpake: This is my bodie. &amp;c. And this is the Catholique faith, againſt the which, how thauctor wil fortify, that he would haue called Catholique, and confute that he improueth. I intend hereafter more particularly to touche in diſcuſſion of that is ſayd, wherein I will kepe this ordre. Firſt to conſidre the thirde booke, that ſpeaketh againſt the fayth of the real preſence of Chriſtes moſt precious bodie &amp; bloud in the ſacrament, then againſt the fourth, &amp; ſo returne to the ſecond, ſpeakyng of Tranſubſtātiation, wherof to talke, the real preſence, not beyng diſcuſſed, were clearly ſuperfluous. And finally, I wyll ſomewhat ſay of the fift booke alſo.
            
            
               
               The confutation of the thyrd booke.
               
                  IN the beginyng of the thyrde booke, thauctor hath thought good to note certaine differences, whiche I will alſo particularly conſider. It foloweth in him thus.
               They teache that Chriſt is in the bread and wyne: But we ſay accordyng to The auctor. the truth, that he is in them that worthely eat and drinke the bread and wyne.
               Note here (Reader) euen in then
                     •
                  re of the The anſwer. compariſon of theſe differēces, how vntruly the true fayth of the Churche is reported, whiche doth not teache that Chriſt is in the bread and wyne (which was the doctrine of Luther.) But the true fayth is, that Chriſtes moſt precious bodie &amp; bloud, is by the might of his worde and determinacion of his will, which he declareth by his worde, in his holie ſupper preſēt, vnder forme of bread &amp; wyne, the ſubſtaunce of whiche natures of bread &amp; wyne, is conuerted into his moſt precious bodie and bloud as it is truely beleued and taught in the Catholique Church, of whiche

teachyng this auctor can not be ignoraunte. So as (thauctor) of this booke reporteth an vntruth wittyngly againſt his conſcience, to ſay they teache (callyng thē Papiſtes,) that Chriſt is in the bread &amp; wyne, but they agre in forme of teachyng with that the Churche of England teacheth at this day, in the diſtribution of the holie communion, in that it is there ſayd the bodie and bloud of Chriſt to be vnder the forme of bread and wyne. And thus much ſerueth for declaracion of the wrong and vntrue reporte of the fayth of the Catholique church made of this auctor, in the ſettyng forth of this difference on that part. whiche it pleaſeth him to name Papiſtes. And nowe to ſpeake of the other parte of the difference on thauctors ſide, when he would tell what he and his ſay, he conueyeth a ſence craftely in wordes to ſerue for a difference: ſuche as no Catholique man would deny. For euery Catholique teacher graunteth, that no man can receaue worthely Chriſtes precious bodie and bloud in the Sacrament, onleſſe he hath by fayth and charitie Chriſt dwellyng in him, for otherwiſe, ſuche one as hath not Chriſt in him, receaueth Chriſtes bodie in the Sacrament vnworthely, to his condempnaciō. Chriſt can not be receaued worthely, but in to his owne temple, whiche be ye (S. Paule

ſayth) &amp; yet, he that hath not / Chriſtes ſpirit in him, is not his, As for callyng it bread and wyne, a Catholique man forbereth not that name, ſignifiyng, what thoſe creatures were before the conſecracion in ſubſtaunce. Wherfore appeareth, how thauctor of this boke in the lieu and place of a difference, whiche he pretendeth he would ſhew, bringeth in that vnder a (But) which euery Catholique man, muſt nedes confeſſe, that Chriſt is in them, who worthely eate and drinke the ſacramēt of his bodie &amp; bloud, or the bread and wyne as this auctor ſpeaketh.
               But and this auctor would haue ſpoken plainely, and compared truely the difference of the two teachynges / he ſhould in the ſecond part haue ſayd ſomewhat contrarie to that the Catholique churche teacheth, which he doth not / and therfore, as he ſheweth vntruth in the firſt reporte, ſo he ſheweth a ſleight and ſhifte in the declaracion of the ſecond part, to ſay that repungneth not to the firſt matter, &amp; that no Catholique man will deny / conſideryng that the ſayd two teachynges be not of one matter, nor ſhote not (as one might ſay) to one marke. For the firſt part, is of the ſubſtaunce of the Sacrament to be receaued, where it is truth, Chriſt to be preſent God and man: The ſecond part is of Chriſtes ſpiritual preſence in the man that receaueth, which in dede muſt be in him before he receaue the ſacramēt, or he can not

receyue the Sacrament worthely, as afore is ſayd, whiche two partes may ſtand well together, without any repugnaunce, and ſo both the differences, thus taught, make but one catholique doctrine. Let vs ſe what the auctor ſayth further.
               They ſay, that when any mā eateth the bread and The auctor. drynketh the cup, Chriſt goeth into his mouth or ſtomoke with the bread and wyne, and no further: But we ſay / that Chriſt is in the hole man, both in body and ſoule, of him that worthely eateth the bread and drynketh the cup, and not in his mouth or ſtomoke onely.
               In this compariſon, thauctor termeth the The anſwer. true Catholique teachyng at his pleaſure, to bryng it in contempte. Whiche doyng in rude ſpeache would be called otherwiſe then I wyll terme it. Truth it is (as Sainct Auguſtine ſayth) we receaue in the Sacrament the body of Chriſt, with our mouthe, and ſuche ſpeache other vſe, as a booke ſet forth in the archbiſſhoppe of Cantorburies name called a Cathechiſme, willeth children to be taught that they receaue with their bodely mouth the body and bloud of, Chriſt, whiche I allege becauſe it ſhall appeare it is a teachyng ſet forth among vs of late as hath been alſo and is by the booke of comen prayor beyng the mooſt true Catholique doctrine of the ſubſtaunce of the Sacrament, in that it is there ſo Catholiquely ſpoken of, whiche booke this auctor doth after ſpecially

allow, how ſo euer all the ſumme of his teachyng doth improue it in that point. So much is he contrarie to him ſelfe in this worke, and here in this place not caryng (what he ſayth) reporteth ſuche a teachyng in the firſt parte of this difference, as I haue not hearde of before: There was neuer man of learnyng that I haue red, termed the matter ſo, that Chriſt goeth into the ſtomoke of the mā that receaueth and no further. For that is writtē, contra Stercoroniſtas, is nothyng to this teachyng, nor the ſpeache of any gloſe if there be any ſuch, were herein to be regarded. The Catholique doctrine is, that by the holy coniunction in the Sacrament, we be ioyned to Chriſt really, becauſe we receaue in the holy ſupper, the moſt precious ſubſtaunce of his glorious body, whiche is a fleſhe geuyng life: And that is not digeſted into our fleſhe, but worketh in vs and attempereth, by heauenly nurrttor, our body and ſoule beyng partakers of his paſſyon to be conformable to his will and by ſuche ſpiritual foode to be made more ſpirituall. In the receauyng of whiche foode, in the moſt bleſſed Sacrament our body and ſoule in them that duelie cōmunicate, worketh together in due ordre without other diſcuſſyon of the myſterie then God hath ordred (that is to ſay) the ſoule to beleue as it is taught, and the body to do as God hath ordred, knowyng that gloryous fleſhe by our eatyng can not be conſumed or ſuffre, but to

be moſt profitable vnto ſuch as do accuſtonie worthely to receiue the ſame. But to ſay that the churche teacheth how we receaue Chriſt at our mouth, and he goeth into our ſtomoke and no further, is a reporte which by the iuſt iudgemente of God is ſuffred to come out of the mouthe of them that fyght againſt the truth in this moſt high myſterie.
               Now where this auctor in the ſecōde part by an aduerſiteue with a (But) to make the compariſon, telleth what he and his ſay, he telleth in effect that which euery Catholique man muſt nedes, and doth confeſſe: For ſuch as receaue Chriſtes moſt precious body and bloud in the Sacrament worthly, they haue Chriſt dwellyng in thē, who conforteth both body and ſoule, whiche the church hath euer taught moſt plainely, ſo as this compariſon of differēce in his two parties, is made of one open vntruth, &amp; a truth diſguiſed, as though it were now firſt opened by this auctor and his, whiche maner of handelyng declareth what ſleyght and ſhift is vſed in the matter.
               They ſay, that Chriſt is receyued in the mouth, &amp; The auctor. entreth in with the bread and wyne: We ſay, that he is receyued in the heart / and entreth in by faith.
               Here is a pretie ſlaight in this cōpariſon, The anſwer. where both partes of the compariſon may be vnderſtanded on bothe ſydes, and therfore, here is by thauctor in this cōpariſon no iſſue ioyned: For the worthy receauyng of Chriſts body and bloud in the Sacramente, is both

with mouth, &amp; heart, both in facte &amp; faith, After whiche ſorte (S. Peter) in the laſt ſupper, receaued Chriſtes body, wheras, in the ſame ſupper, Iudas receaued it with mouth, &amp; in fact only, wherof S. Auguſtin ſpeketh in this wiſe. Non dicunt iſta, niſi qui de mēſa domini 
                  Auguſt. contra li teras pe til. lib. 2 cap. 47. 
                  vitāſumunt, Sicut Petrus, non iudicium ſicut Iudas, et tamen ipſa vtrique fuit vna, ſed non vtri
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      valuit ad vnum, quia ipſi nō erant vnū. Whiche wordes be thus muche to ſay: That they ſay not ſo (as was before entreated) but ſuche, as receaue life of our Lordes table (as Peter did) not iudgment, (as Iudas) and yet the table was all one to them both, but it was not to all one effect, in thē both, becauſe they were not one. Here (S. Auguſtine) noteth the difference in the receauer, not in the Sacrament receaued, whiche beyng receaued with the mouth onely, and Chriſt entryng, in myſterie only, doth not ſanctify vs, but is the ſtone of ſtumblyng and our iudgement and condempnacion, but if he be receaued with mouthe and body, with hearte and fayth, to ſuch he bryngeth life and nurriſhemēt, wherfore in this compariſon, thauctor hath made no difference, but with diuers termes, the catholique teachyng is deuided into two membres with a (But) facioned neuertheles, in an other phraſe of ſpeache then the church hath vſed, whiche is ſo commen in this auctor that I will not hereafter note it any more for a faulte. Let vs go further.
               
                  
They ſay that Chriſt is really in the Sacramē
                  tall The auctor. bread beyng reſerued an whole yere, ſo long as the forme of bread remaineth, but after the receauyng therof, he flieth vp (they ſay) from the receyuer, vnto heauen, as ſone as the bread is chawed in the mouth, or chaunged in the ſtomoke. But (we ſay) that Chriſt remayneth in the man that worthely receaueth it, ſo long as the man remayneth a membre of Chriſt.
               This compariſon is like the other before, The anſwer. wherof the firſt parte is garniſhed and embloſſed with vntruth, and the ſecond parte, that the church hath euer taught moſt truly, &amp; that al muſt beleue, and therfore that pece hath no vntruth in the matter, but in the maner only, beyng ſpokē as though it diffred frō the continuall open reachyng of the churche which is not ſo, wherfor in the maner of it in vtteraunce ſignifieth an vntruth, whiche in the matter it ſelfe is neuertheleſſe moſt true. For vndoutedly, Chriſt remaineth in the mā, that worthely receiueth the ſacramēt, ſo lōg as that man remayneth a membre of Chriſt. In this firſt part, there is a fault, in the matter of the ſpeache, for explicacion wherof, I wil examin it particularly. This auctor ſaith (they ſay) that Chriſt is really in the Sacramētal bread beyng reſerued an hole yere. &amp;c. The church geuyng faith to Chriſtes worde, whē he ſayd: This is my body. &amp;c. techeth the body of Chriſt to be preſent in the Sacramēt vnder the forme of bread: vnto which words whē we put the worde really, it ſerueth only to expreſſe that truth in open wordes, which

was afore to be vnderſtāded in ſence. For in Chriſt, who was the body of al the ſhadowes &amp; figures of the law, &amp; who did exhibit &amp; geue in his ſacramētes of the new law, the things promiſed in his ſacramentes of tholde lawe. We muſt vnderſtād his wordes in the inſtitucion of his ſacraments without figure in the ſubſtance of the celeſtial thyng of thē, &amp; therfore when he ordred his moſt precious bodye &amp; bloud to be eatē &amp; drunken of vs vnder the formes of bread &amp; wyne, we profeſſe &amp; beleue that truely he gaue vs his moſt precious body in the Sacramēt for a celeſtial foode, to cō
                  fort &amp; ſtrength vs in this miſerable life. And for the certayntie of the truth of his worke therin, we ꝓfeſſe he geueth vs his body realy that is to ſay, in ded his body the thing it ſelf: Which is, the heauenly part of the Sacramēt called (Euchariſtia) hauyng the viſible forme of bread &amp; wyne, &amp; cōteinyng inuiſibly the verie body &amp; bloud of our ſauiour Chriſt, which was not wont to be reſerued other wiſe, but to be ready for ſuch as in danger of death call for it, &amp; the ſame ſo lōg, as it may be vſed, is ſtill the ſame ſacramēt, which only, tyme altereth not, wherof Cyril wrote to this ſence, Cyrillꝰ ad Calo ſyriū epi ſcopum. Heſichiꝰ in leuit. li. 2. ca. 8 many hundred yeres paſt, &amp; Heſichius alſo, &amp; what ought to be done when by negligēce of the miniſtre, it wer reſerued ouerlong. Mary where it liketh thauctor of theſe differēces, to ſaye the church teacheth, Chriſt to flye vp frō the receauer vnto heauē, ſo ſone as the bread

is chawed in the mouth, or chaunged it rite ſtomake, this maner of ſpeache implyeth as though Chriſt lefte the ſeate of his maieſtie in heauen, to be preſent in the Sacrament, which is moſt vntrue. The churche acknowledgeth, beleueth, and teacheth truely, that Chriſt ſytteth on the right hāde of his father in glory, from whence he ſhall come to iudge the world, &amp; alſo teacheth Chriſtes very body &amp; bloud, &amp; Chriſt himſelfe God &amp; man, to be preſent in the Sacrament, not by ſhifryng of place, but by the determinatiō of his will, declared in ſcriptures &amp; beleued of the Catholique church, which articles be to reaſon impoſſible, but poſſible to God omnipotent. So as beyng taught of his wil, we ſhould hūbly ſubmitte al our ſences &amp; reaſon to the faith of his wil &amp; worke declared in his ſcriptures. In the beleif of which myſteries is great benefit &amp; conſolacion, &amp; in the vnreuerent ſerche &amp; curious diſcuſſiō of thē, preſumptuous boldnes &amp; wicked temerite. I knowe by fayth, Chriſt to be preſent, but the particularite, how he is preſent, more then I am aſſured, he is truely preſent, &amp; therfore in ſubſtaunce preſent, I cā
                  not tell, but preſent he is, &amp; truely is, &amp; verely is, and ſo in dede, that is to ſay, really is, and vnfaynedly is, and therfore in ſubſtaunce is, and as we terme it, ſubſtancially is preſent. For all theſe aduerbes, really, ſubſtancially with the reſt, be conteyned in the one worde (is) ſpoken out of his mouthe, that ſpeaketh

as he meaneth, truely &amp; certaynely as Chriſt did, ſaiyng: This is my body that ſhalbe betrayed for you, who then caryed himſelfe in his handes after a certayne maner (as ſainet Auguſtine ſayth) whiche neuer man beſides Auguſt. Pſal. 33. him could do, who in that his laſt ſuper gaue himſelfe to be eaten without cōſumyng: The wayes &amp; meanes wherof, no man can tell, but humble ſpirites, as they be taught muſt conſtantly beleue it, without thinkyng or talkyng of fliyng or ſliyng of Chriſt agayne vnto heauen, where Chriſt is in the glory of his father continually, and is neuertheleſſe, becauſe he will ſo be preſent in the Sacramēt, whole God and man, and dwelleth corporally in him that receyueth him worthely. Wherfore (reader) when thou ſhalt agayne well conſider this cōpariſon, thou ſhalt finde true, howe the firſt parte is diſguiſed with vntrue reporte of the commen teachynge of the churche, howſoeuer ſome gloſe, or ſome priuate teacher might ſpeake of it, and the ſecōd part, ſuche as hath been euer ſo taught. One thyng (I thinke) good to admoniſhe the reader, that whatſoeuer I affirme, or preciſely denye, I meane within the compaſſe of my knowlege, which I ſpeake not becauſe I am in any ſuſpiciō, or dout of that I affirme or deny, but to auoyde the temerite of deniyng (as neuer) or affirmyng (as euer) which he extremities. And I mean alſo of publike doctrin by conſent receyued, ſo taught &amp; beleued, and

not that any one man might blindely write as vtteryng his fanſye as this auctor dothe for his pleaſure. There foloweth in the auctor thus.
               They ſay that in the Sacrament the corporall The auctor. membres of Chriſt, be not diſtante in place on from an other, but that wherſoeuer the hede is, there be the fee
                     •
                  e, &amp; wherſoeuer the armes be, ther be the legges, ſo that in euery parte of the bread and wyne is all together, whole hede, whole feete, whole fleſhe, whole bloud, whole hearte, whole longes, whole breaſte, whole backe, and al togither whole, confuſed and mixte without diſtinction, or diuerſite. O what a foliſhe and an abhominable inuentiō is this? to make of the moſt pure and perſite bodye of Chriſt, ſuche a confuſe and monſtrouſe bodye, And yet can the Papiſtes imagyne nothyng ſo foliſhe, but al chriſtē people, muſt receyue the ſame, as an oracle of God, &amp; as a moſt certayne article of theyr fayth, without whiſperyng to the contrarye.
               This is merueylous Rhetorique, &amp; ſuche The anſwer. as thauctor hath ouerſene himſelfe in the vtteraunce of it, &amp; cōfeſſeth himſelf pretely abuſed, to the latter ende of his yeres to haue beleued that, he now calleth ſo foliſhe. But to the purpoſe. In the booke of commen prayor (now at this tyme) ſet forthe in this realme: At is ordred to teache the people, that in eche parte of the bread conſecrate, broken, is the hole body of our ſauior Chriſt, which is agreable to the Catholique doctrine: Upō accaſiō hereof, it liketh this auctor to multiply language by enumeraciō of partes, and becauſe

reaſon without fay the, directeth the bodely eye, to ſo litle a viſible quātitie in the hooſte. This auctor beareth in hand, the Catholique churche to ſay, and teache, al that fonde reaſon diuiſeth, where as the churche, in the doctrine of this miſtery, denyeth al that reaſon without fayth diuiſeth: And therfore, when we acknowledge by faythe, Chriſtes body preſent, although we ſay, it is preſēt truely, really, ſubſtancially, yet we ſay, our ſenſes be not priuy to that preſence, ne the maner of it, but by inſtruction of fayth, and therfore we ſaye, Chriſtes body to be not locally preſent, not by maner of quantite but inuiſibly, and in no ſenſible maner, but meruelouſly in a Sacramēt and miſtery truely, and in ſuche a ſpiritual maner, as we can not defyne and determyne, &amp; yet by faith, we know his body preſent, the partes of whiche, be in them ſelf diſtincte one frō an other, in their swne ſubſtance, but not by circumſcription of ſeuerall places to be comprehended of our capacitie, which partes, we can not by demonſtracion place, nor by imaginaciō diſplace, diminiſhe, altre, or cōfound (as this auctor) for his pleaſure reporteth, who writeth mōſt rouſly in ſo high a miſtery, &amp; impudētly beareth in hand the Catholique churche, to teache that he lyſteth to beare in hād (may by wanton reaſō) be deduced of their teachyng, wher as altrue chriſtiā men beleue ſimply Chriſtes wordes, &amp; trouble not their heades with ſuche conſequēces,

as ſeme to ſtryue with reaſō. This is in th auctor no whiſperyng, but plainly raylyng, wherin (if he had remembred himſelfe wel) he would not haue ſpokē of all chriſtian men in the receypt of that he entēdeth to diſproue. And if (he would ſay) he ſpake it by an Ironie or ſkorne, yet it implyeth that all had receyued that he thus mocketh. Whiche after the ſorte he writeth, was neuer diuiſed by Papiſte, or other to be ſo taught, otherwiſe then, as this auctor might rede it, as an idle argument, to ſhewe abſurdite in reaſon. For in gods workes, as the ſacramentes be, we muſt thinke al ſemelynes in dede without deformite, euē as we beleue al gods iudgemē
                  tes iuſt &amp; true, although reaſō cōclude in thē euidēt īiquitie. Mās reaſō whē it ſemeth moſt galaūt is ful of ſportes &amp; folie. Gods workes be al ſemelynes, without confuſion, monſtre or any ſuch abſurditie, as this auctor ſuppoſeth. Although I cā not, in the ſacramēt with the eye of my reaſō, locally diſtincte Chriſtes head frō his foote, his legge, frō his arme, &amp; wher in the boke of cōmon prayor, it is truly ſayd, ī eche part of the bread cōſecrat brokē to be Chriſts hole body, if one of curioſite wold queſtiō with me, &amp; I of foly wold anſwer him firſt wher is Chriſts head? I ſhould ſay here (pointyng with my finger) he would thinke it firſt a lytle head. Thē he would aſke, wher is his foote, &amp; I ſhold ſay ther, &amp; pointe in the ſame place agayne, for there is noone other left. If he replyed that I poynted before the

ſame for the head, might not the thyrd, a Catholique mā, that ſtode by, (trowe you) wiſely caiie vs both madde, to goo aboute to diſcuſſe, that we muſt graūt we ſee not, &amp; whē by faythe, we knowe only the beyng preſent of Chriſtes moſt preciouſe body, thē by blynd reaſon, to diſcuſſe the maner of beyng in the ſituacion of ſuche partes, as we do not ſee? Now if there came among vs a fourth man as a mediator, &amp; would do as kyng Alexander did when he could not open the knot of Quintꝰ Cur

And to commende further his diuiſe vnto vs, would percaſe tell how many abſurdities as he thinketh and inconueniences might be auoyded by it. This fourth man I ſpeake of, makyng him ſelfe a mediatour vnmete therfore, becauſe he hath no participatiō with fayth: yet if our religion and fayth wer mans inuention, as that of Numa Pompilius was, ſhould not vtter thys his conceyte all idelly.

But our fayth, is of hearyng, as hath been preached contynually from the beginnyng, grounded vpon the moſt ſure truthe of the worde of God, and therfore can not be attempered as man would diuiſe it, to exclude trauayle in carnal reaſon.

Now in the Sacramēt to ſay Chriſtes bodye is preſent only by ſignification, as it releueth in ſome mennes indgementes the abſurdities in reaſon, which ought not to be relieued: So it condempneth al the true publique fayth teſtified in the churche from the beginyng hitherto, &amp; ſheweth the lerned holy men, to haue wondred in their writynges at that whiche hath no wounder at al: to ordeyne one thyng to be the ſignification of an other, which is practiſed dayly among men. But from the beginnyng the miſtery of the Sacrament hath been with wounder merueyled at, how Chriſt made bread his body, and wyne his bloud, and vnder the figure of theſe viſible creatures, gaue inuiſibly his precious body and bloud preſently there.

Thus ſayth S. Auguſtyne and therfore be the receyuer worthy or vnworthy, good or euil, the ſubſtaunce of Chriſtes Sacrament is all one as beyng goddes worke, who worketh vniformely, and yet is not in all that receyue of like effecte, not for any alteracion or diminution in it, but for the diuerſitie of him that receyueth: So as the report made here of the doctrine of the Catholique churche vnder the name of Papiſtes, is a very true reporte, and for want of grace reproued by thauctor as no true doctrine. And the ſeconde part of the compariſon on thauctors ſide, conteyned vnder (we ſay) by them that in hypocriſye pretēd to be truthes frendes, conteyneth an vntruth, to the ſimple reader, and yet hath a matter of wranglyng to the learned reader, becauſe of the worde (very) which referred to thefecte of eatyng the body of Chriſt, wherby to receyue life, may be ſo ſpokē, that none receyue the body of Chriſte with the very effecte of life, but ſuche as eate the ſacrament

ſpirituallye, that is to ſaye with true fayth worthely. And yet euill men as Iudas, receiue the ſame very body, touchyng the truth of the preſence therof, that S. Peter did. For in the ſubſtaunce of the Sacrament, whiche is Goddes worke is no variete, who ordeyneth all (as afore) vniformely, but in man is the variete, amonges whō he that receyueth worthely Chriſtes body, receyueth life, and he that receyueth vnworthely, receyueth cō
                  dempnacion. There foloweth further.
               They ſay that good men eate the body of Chriſt The auctor. and drinke his bloud only at that tyme when they receyue the Sacrament: we ſay that they eate / drinke and fede of Chriſt continually / ſo long as they be membres of his body.
               What forehede, I pray you, is ſo heatdened, The anſwer. that can vtter this among them, that know any thing of the learnyng of Chriſtes churche? In whiche it is a moſt cōmon diſtinction, that there is thre maner of eatynges of Chriſtes body and bloud: one ſpiritual only, whiche is here affirmed in the ſeconde parte (we ſay) wherein the auctor and his ſay, as the churche ſayth. Another eatyng is bothe ſacramentally &amp; ſpiritually, whiche is when men worthely communicate in the ſupper. The thyrd is ſacramentally only, whiche is by men vnworthy, who eate and drynke in the holy ſupper to their cōdempnacion only. And the learned men in Chriſtes churche ſay that the ignoraūce, &amp; want of obſeruacion of

theſe thre maner of eatynges, cauſeth the errour in thunderſtandyng of the ſcriptures &amp; ſuche fathers ſaiynges, as haue written of the Sacrament. And when the churche ſpeaketh of theſe thre maner of eatynges, what an impudēcy is it, to ſay that the church teacheth good mē only to eat the body of Chriſt and drinke his bloud, when they receyue the Sacrament, beyng the truth otherwiſe, and yet a diuerſitie there is, of eatyng ſpiritually onely, &amp; eatyng ſpiritually &amp; ſacramentally, becauſe in the ſupper they receyue his very fleſhe and very bloud in dede, with theffectes of all graces and giftes to ſuche as receyue it ſpiritually and worthely: where as out of the ſupper, whē we eat only ſpiritually by faith, God that worketh without his ſacramētes, as ſemeth to him, doth releaue thoſe that beleue and truſt in him, &amp; ſuffreth them not to be deſtitute of that is neceſſary for them, wherof we may not preſume, but ordenarely ſeke god, wher he hath ordred himſelf to be ſought &amp; there to aſſure our ſelfe of his couenauntes and promyſes, whiche be moſt certaynely annexed to his ſacramētes, wherunto we ought to geue moſt certayne truſt &amp; confidēce. wherfore to teache the ſpirituall manducaciō to be equal with the ſpiritual manducation &amp; ſacramental alſo, that is to dimiſhe theffecte of the inſtitution of the Sacramēt, whiche no Chriſten man ought to do.
               They ſay that the body of Chriſt that is in the The

               In this cōpariſon is both ſleight &amp; crafte? The anſwer. In the firſt part of it, which is that they ſay, there is mention of the body of Chriſt which is propre of thumanitie of Chriſt. In the ſeconde parte, whiche is of (we ſay) there is no mention of Chriſtes body, but of Chriſt, who in his diuine nature, is vnderſtanded preſent without a body: Nowe the Sacrament is inſtitute of Chriſtes body and bloud, and becauſe the diuine nature in Chriſticontinueth the vnitie with the body of Chriſt, we muſt nedes confeſſe, where the body of Chriſt is, there is whole Chriſt God &amp; man. And whe we ſpeake of Chriſtes body, we muſt vnderſtande a true body, whiche hath both fourme and quantitie, and therfore ſuche as confeſſe the true Catholique fayth, they affirme of Chriſtes body all truth, of a naturall body, whiche although it hath all thoſe truthes of fourme and quantitie, yet they ſay Chriſtes body is not preſent after the maner of quantitie nor in a viſible fourme as it was conuerſaunt in this preſent life, but that there it is truely in the Sacramēt the very true body of Chriſt, which good men beleue vpon the credite of Chriſt that ſayd ſo, &amp; knowlege therwith the maner of that preſēce, to be an high myſtery, and the maner ſo ſpirituall, as the

                  arnall man can not by diſcourſe of reaſon

reache it, but in his diſcourſe ſhal as this auctor doth, thinke it a vanitie and foliſheneſſe, Whiche foliſheneſſe, neuertheleſſe ouercommeth the wiſdome of the worlde. And thus I haue opened what they ſay on the Catholique parte. Now for the other parte wherof this auctor is, and with his fayth (we ſaye) the wordes ſeme to imply, that Chriſtes humayne body is not in the Sacramēt, in that it is ſayd, Chriſt to be there ſacramentally &amp; ſpirituallye, without fourme or quantitie, whiche ſaiyng hath no ſcripture for it. For the ſcripture ſpeaketh of Chriſts body which was betrayed for vs, to be geuen vs to be eaten. Where alſo Chriſtes diuinitie is preſent, as accompaniyng his humanitie, which humanitie is ſpecially ſpoken of, the preſence of whiche humanite, when it is denyed, then is there no text to proue the preſence of Chriſtes diuinitie ſpecially, that is to ſay, otherwiſe then it is by his omnipotencye preſente euery where. And to conclude this piece of compariſon, this maner of ſpeache was neuer I thinke redde, that Chriſt is preſent in the Sacramēt without fourme or quantitie. And S. Paule ſpeaketh of a fourme in the godhead, (Qui quum in forma dei eſſet.) Who Phil. 2. when he was in the fourme of God. So as if Chriſt be preſent in the Sacrament without all fourme, then is he there, neither as God nor man, whiche is a ſtraunger teachyng thē yet hath been heard or redde of, but into ſuch

abſurdities in dede do they fall, who entreat irreuerently and vntruely this high miſterie. This is here worthy a ſpeciall note how by the maner of the ſpeache in the latter parte of this difference, the teachyng ſemeth to be, that Chriſt is ſpiritually preſent in the Sacrament, becauſe of the worde (there) which thou reader mayeſt compare how it agreeth with the reſt of this auctors doctrine, Let vs go to the next.
               They ſay that the fathers, and Prophetes of the The auctor. old teſtament, did not eate the body, nor drinke the bloud of Chriſt. We ſay, that they did eat his body, and drinke his bloud, although he wer not yet borne nor incarnated.
               This compariſon of difference, is clerkely The anſwer. conceyued, as it wer of a ryddle, wherin, nay &amp; yea, when they be opened, agree &amp; conſent. The fathers did eate Chriſtes body &amp; drinke his bloud in truth of promyſe, whicht was effectual to thē of redemption to be wrought, not in truth of preſence, (as we do) for confirmation of redemption already wrought. They had a certayne promyſe, and we a certayne preſent payment: they did eate Chriſt ſpiritually, beleuing in him that was to come but they did not eate Chriſtes body preſent in the Sacrament, ſacramentally, and ſpiritually, as we do. Their ſacramentes were figures of the thynges, but out conteyne the very thinges. And therfore albeit in a ſence to the learned men, it may be verefyed, that the

fathers did eat the body of Chriſt &amp; drink his bloud, yet there is no ſuche forme of wordes in ſcripture, &amp; it is more agreable to the ſimplicitie of ſcripture, to ſay the fathers before Chriſtes natiuite, did not eate the body and bloud of Chriſt, whiche body &amp; bloud Chriſt himſelfe truely toke of the body of the virgin Marie. For although S. Paule in the tenth to the Corinthians, be ſo vnderſtanded of ſome, as the fathers ſhould eat the ſame ſpiritual meat, &amp; drinke the ſame ſpiritual drinke that we do, to which vnderſtādyng, al do not agree, yet folowyng that vnderſtādyng, we may not ſo preſſe the words, as there ſhould be nō differēce at al, &amp; this one ſpecial differēce S. Auguſtine noteth how their ſacramentes conteyned the promyſe of that, whiche in our ſacramentes is geuē. Thus he ſayth; &amp; this is euidēt of it ſelfe, how to vs in the holy ſupper Chriſt ſayth: (This is my body that ſhall be betrayed for you (Take, eate) which was neuer ſayd to the fathers, although their fayth in ſubſtance agreed with our, hauyng al one Chriſt &amp; mediatour, whiche they loked for to come, &amp; we acknowledge to be already cōme. (Come &amp; to come) as S. Auguſtine ſayth differeth, But Chriſt is one, by whom all was create, &amp; mans fal repared, from whom is all fedyng corporall &amp; ſpirituall, &amp; in whom al is reſtored in heauen, &amp; in earth. In this fayth of Chriſt, the fathers were fedde with heauenly ſpiritual foode, whiche was the ſame with ours in reſpecte of the reſtitution by

Chriſt, &amp; redemption by them hoped, whiche is atchieued by the myſtery of the body and bloud of Chriſt, by reaſon wherof I denye not, but it may be ſayd in a good ſence, howe they dyd eate the body and bloud of Chriſt before he was incarnate, but as I ſayd before, ſcripture ſpeaketh not ſo, and it is no holſome facion of ſpeache at this tyme, which furthereth in ſounde to the eares of the rude, the peſtilent hereſy, wherin Ione of kent obſtinately Ione of Kētes obſtinacye. dyed, that is to ſay, that Chriſt toke nothyng of the virgyn, but brought his body with him frō aboue, beyng a thyng worthy to be noted, how the old hereſi, deniyng the true takyng of the fleſhe of Chriſt in the virgyns wōde, at the ſame tyme to reuiue. When the true deliuerance of Chriſtes fleſhe in the holy ſupper be of vs eatē, is alſo denyed. For as it is a mere truth without figure, &amp; yet an high miſtery, godsworke in thincarnatiō of Chriſt wherin our fleſhe was of Chriſt truly takē of the virgyns ſubſtance: So is it a mere truth, without figure, &amp; yet an high miſtery &amp; gods worke, in the geuyng of the ſame true fleſhe, truly to be in the ſupper eatē. Whē I exclude figure in the Sacrament, I meane not of the viſible parte, whiche is called a figure of the celeſtial inuiſible parte, whiche is truly there without figure wherby to empayre the truth of that preſēce, which I adde to auoyde cauillatiō. And to make an ende of this cōpariſon, this I ſay, that this article declareth wātones

to make a differēce in wordes, where none is in the ſence rightly taken, wit

               The body of Chriſt, is by goddes omnipotency, The anſwer. who ſo worketh in his worde, made preſent vnto vs at ſuche tyme, as the churche prayeth, it may pleaſe him ſo to do, whiche prayour is ordred to be made in the booke of common prayour now ſet forth, Wherin we require of God, the creatures of bread and wyne to be ſanctified, and to be to vs the body and bloud of Chriſt, whiche they can not be, onles God worketh it, &amp; make them ſo to be: In whiche miſtery it was neuer taught, as this auctor willyngly myſreporteth, that Chriſtes moſt precious body, is made of the matter of bread, but in that ordre, exhibitie &amp; made preſent vnto vs, by cōuerſion of the ſubſtaunce of bread into his precious body, not a new body made of a newe matter of bread &amp; wyne, but a newe preſence of the body, that is neuer old, made preſēt there, wher the ſubſtāce of bread &amp; wine was before. So as this cōpariſon of differēce is mere wrāglyng &amp; ſo euidēt, as it nedeth no further anſwer, but a note:

                  o how they be not aſhamed to trifle in

ſo great a matter, &amp; without cauſe by wrong termes, to bring the truth in ſlaunder, (if it were poſſible). May not this be accompted, as a parte of Gods puniſhement, for men of knowlege to wryte to the people ſuch, matter ſeriouſly, as were not tollerable to be by a ſcoffer diuiſed in a play, to ſupply when his felowe had forgotten his parte.
               They ſay that the maſſe is a ſacrifice ſatiſfactory for ſynne, by the deuocion of the prieſt that offreth, The auctor and not by the thyng that is offred. But we ſay that their 
                     •
                  aiyngs a moſt haynous, yea, and deteſtable errour agaynſt the glorye of Chriſt. For the ſatiſfaction of our ſynnes, is not the deuotion nor offryng of the prieſt, but thonly hoſt and ſatiſfaction for al the ſynnes of the world, is the death of Chriſt, and thoblation that Chriſt himſelfe offred ones vpon the croſſe, and neuer but ones, nor neuer none but he. And therfore that oblation, whiche the prieſtes make dayly in their papiſticall maſſes, can not be ſatiſfaction for other mennes ſynnes, by the prieſtes deuotion, but is a mere illuſion, and ſubtyll craft of the deuill, wherby Antichriſt hath many yeres blinded and deceyued the world.
               This compariſon is out of the matter of the preſence of Chriſtes moſt precious body The anſwer. in the Sacrament, whiche preſence (this auctor) in the firſt part of his cōpariſon, ſemeth by implication to graunte, when he findeth faulte, that the prieſtes deuotion ſhould be a ſacrifice ſatiſfactorie, and not the thyng that is offred, whiche maner of doctrine (I neuer red) and I thinke it myſelfe it ought to be

improued, if any ſuch there be to make the deuotiō of the prieſt a ſatiſfactiō. For vndoubtedly Chriſt is our ſatiſfactiō wholly &amp; fully, who hath payde our hole debte to god the father, for thappeſing of his iuſt wrath againſt vs, and hath cācelled the byll obligatory (as S. Paule ſayth) that was againſt vs. For further openyng wherof, if it be aſked howe he ſatiſfyed? we aniwere, as we be taught by the ſcriptures, by thaccompliſhement of the wyl of his father, in his innocēt ſuffryng, his willyng &amp; obediēt ſuffering, the miſeryes of this worlde without ſynne, &amp; the violent perſecution of the worlde, euen to the death of the croſſe, &amp; ſheddyng of his moſt precious bloud. Wherin was perfited the willyng ſacrifice, that he made of himſelfe to God the father for vs, of whom it was writen in the beginnyng of the booke that he ſhould be the body &amp; perfyte accōpliſhmēt of al ſacrifices, as of whom all other ſacrifices before, were ſhadowes &amp; figures. And here is to be cōſidered, howe the obedient wyl in Chriſtes ſacrifice, is ſpecially to be noted, who ſuffred becauſe he would. Whiche S. Paule ſetteth forth in declaratiō of Chriſtes humilitie. And although that willyng obediēce was ended &amp; perfited on the croſſe, to the whiche it cōtinued frō the begining, by reaſō wherof, thoblatiō is in S. Paules ſpeach, attribute ther vnto: yet as in the ſacrifice of abrahā, whē he offred Iſaac, the erneſt wil of offryng, was

accōpted for the offryng in dede, wherpō it is ſayd in ſcripture that Abrahā offred Iſaac, &amp; the declaration of the wil of Abrahā, is called the offryng. So the declaration of Chriſtes wil in his laſt ſupper, was an offryng of him to God the father, aſſuryng there his Apoſtels, of his wil &amp; determination, &amp; by thē al the worlde, that his body ſhould be betrayed for thē &amp; vs, &amp; his precious bloud ſhedde for remiſſiō of ſynne, which his worde he cōfermed thē, with the gift of his precious body to be eaten, &amp; his precious bloud to be dronken. In which miſtery, he declared his body and bloud to be the very ſacrifice of the worlde, by him offred to God the father, by the ſame wil, that he ſayd his body ſhuld be betrayed for vs. And therby aſcertayned vs to be in him willyng, that the Iewes on the croſſe ſemed to execute by violence &amp; force againſt his wil. And therfore as chriſt offred himſelf on the croſſe, in the execution of the worke of his wil, ſo he offred himſelfe in his ſupper, in declaration of his wil, wherby we might be the more aſſured of the effect of his deth which he ſuffred willyngly &amp; determinatly, for the redemptiō of the worlde, with a moſt perfite oblation &amp; ſatiſfaction for the ſynnes of the worlde, exhibite &amp; offred by him to God the father, for the recōciliatiō of mannes nature to gods fauor &amp; grace. And this I wryte becauſe this auctor ſpeaketh ſo preciſely, howe Chriſt offred himſelf neuer but ones, wherby (if he meane by ones offryng) the hole action

of our redēption, whiche was conſummate &amp; perfited vpon the croſſe: Al muſt confeſſe the ſubſtaunce of that worke of redemption, by thoblation of Chriſtes body on the croſſe, to haue been abſolutly finiſhed, &amp; ſo ones offred for al. But there is no ſcripture, wherupō we myght conclude, that Chriſt dyd in this mortall life, but in one particuler momēt of tyme offre himſelfe to his father. For S. Paule deſcribeth it to the Philippians, vnder the Phil. 2. worde of humiliation, to haue continued the hole tyme of Chriſtes conuerſation here, euē to the death, the death of the croſſe. And that thys obedience to God in humilitie is called offeryng, appeareth by S. Paule when he exhorteth vs to offre our bodies, which meaneth a continual obedience in thobſeruation of Gods will, &amp; he calleth (Oblationem gentium) 
                  Rom. 12 to bryng them to fayth. And Abrahās willyng obedience, ready at Gods commaū
                  dement to offre Iſaac, is called the offerynge of Iſaac, and is in very dede a true offeryng and eche man offreth himſelfe to God, when he yeldeth to gods callyng, and preſenteth himſelfe ready to do gods wyl and cōmaundement, who then may be ſay de to offre his ſeruyce (that is to ſay) to place his ſeruice in ſight and before him, before whom, it ſhould be done. And becauſe our ſauiour Chriſt, by the decree of the hole trinite roke mannes nature vpon him, to ſuffre death for our redemption, whiche death, in his laſt ſupper, he

declared playnly, he would ſuffre. We reade in S. Cyprian how Chriſt offred himſelfe in his ſupper. fulfillyng the figure of Melchiſedech, who by thoffryng of bread and wyne ſignifyed that high miſtery of Chriſtes ſupper, in which Chriſt vnder the forme of bread and wyne, gaue his very body and bloud to be eaten and dronken, and in the geuynge therof, declared the determination of his glorious Paſſion, and the fruite and effecte therof, Whiche doyng was a ſwete, &amp; pleaſaunte oblatiō to God the father, conteinyng a moſt perfyte obedience to Gods wyll and pleaſure. And in the miſtery of this ſupper, was writen, made and ſealed a moſt perfyte teſtimonie, for an effectuall memorye of Chriſtes offeryng of himſelfe to his father, and of his death and paſſion with the fruite therof. And therfore Chriſt ordeyned this ſupper, to be obſerued and continued for a memory to his cummyng: So as we that ſawe not, with our bodely eyes Chriſtes death and paſſion, may in the celebration of the ſupper, be moſt ſuredly aſcertayned of the truth, out of Chriſtes owne mouth. Who ſtyl ſpeaketh in the perſon of the miniſtre of the church: This is my body that is betrayed for you: This is my bloud that is ſhedde for you in remiſſion of ſynne: and therwith maketh his very body truely preſent, and his precious bloud truely preſent, to be taken of vs, eaten and dronken. Wherby we be aſſured,

that Chriſt is the ſame to vs, that he was to them, and vſeth vs as familiarly as he did them, offreth himſelf to his father for vs, aſwel as for thē, declareth his wil in the fruit of his death, to perteyn aſwel to vs, as to thē. Of which death we be aſſured by his own mouth, that he ſuffred the ſame to thef: fecte he ſpake of, &amp; by the continual feadyng in this high myſtery, of the ſame very body that ſuffed, and feadyng of it without conſumptiō, beyng continually exhibite vnto vs a liuyng body, and liuely bloud, not only our ſoule is ſpecially and ſpiritually comforted, and our body therby reduced to more conformable obedience to the ſoule, but alſo we by the participation of this moſt precious body and bloud, be aſcertayned of reſurrectiō and regeneration of our bodyes &amp; fleſhe, to be by gods power made incorruptible, &amp; immortal to lyue &amp; haue fruition in God with our ſoule for euer. Wherfore hauyng this myſtery of Chriſtes ſupper, ſo many truthes in it, the churche hath celebrate thē al, and knowledged them al, of one certayntie in truth, not as figures, but really in dede, that is to ſay, as our body ſhal be in the general reſurrectiō regenerate in dede, ſo we beleue we fede here of Chriſtes body in dede. And as it is true, that Chriſtes body in dede is betrayed for vs, ſo it is true, that he geueth vs to eate his very body in dede. And as it is true, that

Chriſt was in yearth and dyd celebrate this ſupper: So it is true that he commaunded it to be celebrate by vs, tyl he come: And as it is true that Chriſt was very God omnipotēt, and very man: So it is true that he could do that he affirmed by his worde himſelfe to do, And as he is moſt ſincere truth: So may we be truely aſſured, that he would, and did as he ſayd. And as it is true that he is moſt iuſſ: ſo it is true that he aſſiſteth the doyng of his commaundement in the celebration of the holy ſupper. And therfore as he is auctor of this moſt holy Sacrament of his precious body and bloud: ſo is he the maker of it, &amp; is the inuiſible prieſt, who as Emiſſene ſayth, Emiſſen by his ſecrete power, with his worde, chaū
                  geth the viſible creatures, into the ſubſtāce of his body and bloud. Wherin manne the viſible prieſt and miniſtre by ordre of the churche, is only a diſpenſer of the myſtery, doyng and ſaiyng, as the holy ghoſt hath taught the churche to be done and ſayd. Finally as we be taught by fayth, all theſe to be true: ſo when wanton reaſō, (fayth beyng a ſhepe) goth about by curioſitie to empayre any one of theſe truthes, the chayne is broken, the lynkes ſparkle abroade, and all is brought in daungier to be ſcattered and ſcambled at. Truthes haue been abuſed, but yet they be true, as they were before. For no man can make that is true falſe,

&amp; abuſe, is mannes faulte &amp; not the thynges. Scripture in ſpeache geueth to man as gods miniſtre, the name of that actiō, which God ſpecially worketh in that miniſtery. So it pleaſeth God to honor the miniſtery of man in his churche, by whom it alſo pleaſeth him to worke effectually. And Chriſt ſayd, they that beleue in me, ſhall do the workes that I do, and greater. When all this honour is geuen to man, as ſpiritually to regenerate, when the miniſtre ſayth (I Baptize the) and to remitte ſynne, to ſuche as fall after, to be alſo a miniſtre in conſecration of Chriſtes moſt precious body, wyth the miniſtration of other ſacramentes, benedictions, &amp; prayour. If man ſhould then waxe proude, &amp; glorye (as of himſelfe) and extolle his owne deuotion in theſe miniſteries, ſuche men ſhould bewraye their owne noughtie hypocriſye, &amp; yet therby empayre not the very dignitie of the miniſtery, ne the very true frute &amp; effecte therof. And therfore when the church, by the miniſtre prayeth, that the creatures of bread and wyne, ſet on thaultare (as the booke of commen prayour in this realme hath ordred) may be vnto vs the body &amp; bloud of our ſauior Chriſt, we require then the celebration of the ſame ſupper, whiche Chriſt made to his Apoſtels, for to be the continual memory of his death, with all frute and effecte, ſuche as the ſame had in the firſt inſtitutiō, Wherfore when the miniſtre pronounſeth Chriſtes

wordes, as ſpoken of his mouth, it is to be beleued, that Chriſt doth nowe, as he did then. And it is to be noted, that although in the ſacramēt of baptiſme, the miniſtre ſaith: I baptize the, yet in the celebratiō of this ſupper, the wordes be ſpoken in Chriſts perſon, as ſaiyng himſelfe: This is my body that is broken for you, which is not to vs only a memory, but an effectuall memory with the very preſence of Chriſtes body &amp; bloud, our very ſacrifice, who doyng now as he did then, offreth himſelfe to his father, as he did thē, not to renewe that offryng as though it wer imperfite, but continually to refreſhe vs, that dayly fall and decay. And as (S. Iohn ſayth) Chriſt is our aduocate &amp; entreateth for vs, or 1. Ioā. 2. pleadeth for vs, not to ſupplye any wante on gods behalfe, but to releaue our wantes in edificatiō, wherin the miniſtery of the church trauayleth to brynge manne to perfection in Chriſt, whiche Chriſt himſelfe dothe aſſiſte and abſolutely perfourme in his churche his myſtical body. Nowe whē we haue Chriſtes body thus preſente in the celebration of the holy ſupper, and by Chriſtes mouth preſent vnto vs, ſaying: This is my body whiche is betrayed for you, Then haue we Chriſts body recommended vnto vs (as oure ſacrifice) and a ſacrifice propiciatory for al the ſynnes of the worlde, beynge the onely ſacrifice of Chriſtes church, the pure and cleane ſacrifice whereof the prophete Malachie ſpake, and Malach.
                  
wherof the fathers in Chriſtes churche haue ſynce the beginnyng contynually writen, the very true preſence wherof, moſt conſtantely beleued, hath encreaſed from tyme to tyme ſuche ceremonyes as haue been vſed in the celebration of that ſupper, in which by Chriſtes owne mouth we be aſcertayned of his moſt glorious death and paſſion and the ſelfe ſame body that ſuffred, deliuered vnto vs in myſterye to be eaten of vs, &amp; therfore ſo to be worſhipped &amp; acknowledged of vs as our very only ſacrifice, in whom, by whom, and for whom our other priuate giftes &amp; ſacrifices be acceptable and none otherwiſe. And therfore as Chriſt declareth in the ſupper himſelfe an offryng &amp; ſacrifice for our ſynne, offryng himſelf to his father as our mediatour, &amp; ſo therwith recommendeth to his father the church his body, for which he ſuffreth: ſo the churche at the ſame ſupper in their offryng of laudes and thankes, with ſuche other giftes as they haue receyued frō God, ioyne thē ſelfe with their head Chriſt, preſentyng &amp; offryng him, as one, by whom, for whom, &amp; in whom all that by gods grace man can do wel, is auaylable &amp; acceptable, &amp; without whom, nothing by vs done, can be pleaſaunce in the ſight of God, wherupon this perſuaſion hath been truely conceyued, whiche is alſo in the booke of commen prayour, in the celebration of the holy ſupper retayned, that it is very profitable at that tyme when the memory of Chriſts

death is ſolempnized, to remēbre with prayour all aſtates of the church, &amp; to recommende thē to God, which S. Paule to Timothe ſemeth 1. Tim. 2. to require. At whiche tyme as Chriſt ſignifyeth vnto vs the certayntie of his death, &amp; geueth vs to be eaten, as it were in pledge, the ſame his precious body that ſuffred: So we for declaratiō of our cōſtdēce in that death &amp; ſacrifice, do kindely remembre with thākes his ſpecial giftes, &amp; charitably remembre the reſt of the membres of Chriſtes churche with prayour, &amp; as we are able, ſhoulde with our bodely goods remēbre at that tyme ſpecially, to releaue ſuch as haue nede by pouertie, And agayne, as Chriſt putteth vs in remēbraunce of his great benefite: ſo we ſhould throughly remēbre him for our parte, with the true confeſſiō of this myſtery, wherin is recapitulate a memorial of al giftes &amp; miſteryes, that God in Chriſt hath wrought for vs. In the cōſide ratiō &amp; eſtimatiō wherof, as there hath been a faulte in the ſecurite of ſuche, as ſo their names wer remēbred in this holy time of memory, they cared not how muche they forgat themſelfe: ſo there may be a faulte in ſuch as neglectyng it, care not whither they be remē
                  bred there at al, &amp; therfore would haue it nothyng, but a plaine eatyng &amp; drinkyng. How much the remēbrance in prayour may auayle no mā mā preſcribe, but that it auayleth euery chriſtē mā muſt cōfeſſe. Mā may nothing and gate to his deuotiō. But ſ. Iames ſayd truly Iaco. 5.
                  
                  (multum valet oratio iuſti aſsidua.) It is to be abhorred to haue hypocrites that counterfecte deuotion, but true deuotion is to be wiſſhed of God and prayed for, whiche is Gods gifte, not to obſcure his glorye, but to ſet it forth, not that we ſhould then truſt in mens merites &amp; prayers, but laud &amp; glorify God in thē 
                  (Qui talem poteſtatem dedit hominibus) one to be iudged able to releue an other with his prayour, referryng all to procede from God, by the mediation of our ſauiour &amp; redemer Ieſus Chriſt. I haue taryed long in this matter, to declare that for theffect of al celeſtial or worldly giftes to be obteined of God in the celebratiō of Chriſts holy ſupper, whē we call it the cōmunion: is now prayed for to be preſent, &amp; is preſent, &amp; with Gods fauour ſhalbe obteyned, if we deuoutly, reuerently, charitably, &amp; quietly, vſe &amp; frequent the ſame without other Innouacions then thordre of the boke preſcribeth. Now to the laſt diffrēce
               They ſay, that Chriſt is corporally in many places The auctor. at one tyme, affirming that his body is corporally &amp; really preſent in as many places as there be hoſtes conſecrated. We ſay, that as the ſonne corporally is euer in heauen, &amp; no where els, &amp; yet by his operation &amp; vertue, the ſonne is here in earth, by whoſe influēce &amp; vertue all thinges in the world be corporally regene rated, encreaſed &amp; grow to their perfite ſtate: So likewiſe our ſauiour Chriſt bodely &amp; corporally is in heuen, ſittyng at the righthande of his father, although ſpirituallye he hath promyſed to be preſent with vs vpō yearth vnto the worldes ende. And when ſo euer

two or thre be gathered together in his name, 
                     〈◊〉
                   is there in the myddes among them, by whoſe ſpiritual grace al godly men be firſt by him ſpiritually regenerate and after encreaſe and growe to their ſpirituall perfection in God, ſpiritually by fayth eatyng his fleſhe and drinkyng his bloud, although the ſame corporally be in heauen.
               The true teachyng is, that Chriſtes very The anſwer. body is preſent vnder the forme of bread, in as many hooſtes as be cōſecrate, in how many places ſoeuer the hooſtes be cōſecrate, &amp; is there really &amp; ſubſtancially, whiche wordes really &amp; ſubſtācially be implyed, whē we ſay truly-preſēt. The worde corporally may haue an ambiguite, &amp; doublenes, in reſpecre &amp; relation. One is to the truth of the body preſent, &amp; ſo it may be ſaid, Chriſt is corporally preſēt in the Sacrament, but (if the worde corporally be referred to the maner of the preſēce) then we ſhould ſay Chriſtes body were preſent after a corporall maner, whiche we ſay not, but in a ſpirituall maner, &amp; therfore not locally, nor by maner of quantitie, but in ſuch a maner as God only knoweth, &amp; yet doth vs to vnderſtand by fayth, the truth of the very preſence, excedyng our capacite to cōprehend the maner (howe.) This is the very true teachyng to affirme the truth of the preſence of Chriſtes very body in the Sacramēt, euen of the ſame bodye that ſuffred in playne ſimple euident termes &amp; wordes, ſuche as can not by cauillatiō be myſtaken &amp; conſtrued, ſo nere as poſſibly mās infirmitie permitteth &amp; ſuffreth.

Nowe let vs cōſider in what ſorte thauctor &amp; his company which he calleth (we ſay) do vnderſtand the Sacramēt, who go about to expreſſe the ſame by a ſimilitude of the creature of the ſonne, whiche ſonne (this auctor ſaith) is euer corporally in heauen, &amp; no where els, &amp; yet by operation &amp; vertue, is here in year: ſo Chriſt is corporally in heauen. &amp;c. In this matter of ſimilitudes, it is to be taken for a truth vndoubted, that there is no creature by ſimilitude, ne any lāguage of man, able to expreſſe God &amp; his myſteries: For and thinges that be ſeē or herd, might throughly expreſſe Gods inuiſible myſteries, the nature whereof is, that they cānot throughly be expreſſed, they wer no myſteries, &amp; yet it is true, that of thinges viſible, wherin God worketh wonderfully, there may be ſome reſemblaunces, ſome ſhadowes, and as it wer inductions, to make a mā aſtomed, in cōſideraciō of thinges inuiſible, when he ſeeth thynges viſible ſo wonderfully wrought, &amp; to haue ſo merueylous effectes. And diuers good catholike deuout men haue by diuerſe naturall thinges gone about to open vnto vs the myſterye of the trinitie, partely by the ſonne, as this auctor doth in the Sacrament, partly by fyre, partely by the ſoule of man, by the Muſiciās ſcience, the arte, the touche, with the players fyngers, &amp; the ſounde of the corde, wherin, when witte hathe all trauayled the matter yet remayneth darke, ne cannot be throughly

ſet forthe by any ſimilitude. But to the purpoſe of this ſimilitude of the ſōne, which ſōne this auctor ſayth is onely corporally in heauē &amp; no where els, &amp; in the yearth the operation &amp; vertue of the ſonne: So as by this auctours ſuppoſal, the ſubſtaunce of the ſonne ſhould not be in yearth: but only by operacion &amp; vertue, wherin (if this auctor erreth) he doth the reader to vnderſtand, that if he erre in cōſideracion of naturall thinges, it is no merueyle though he erre in heauenly thinges. For becauſe I wil not of my ſelfe beginne the cōtenciō with this auctor, of the natural worke of the-ſonne, I will bryng forthe the ſaiyng of Martine Bucer nowe reſidēt at Cambridge, who vehemētly &amp; for ſo much truly, affirmeth the true real preſence of Chriſtes body in the ſacramēt: For he ſayth Chriſt ſayd not, This Bucer. is my ſpirite, this is my vertue, but this is my body: wherfore he ſaith we muſt beleue Chriſtes body to be there, the ſame that did hange vpō the croſſe, our lord himſelf, which in ſom parte to declare he vſeth the ſimilitude of the ſon, for his purpoſe, to proue chriſts body preſēt really &amp; ſubſtācially in the ſacramēt, wher this autor vſeth the ſame ſimilitude to proue the body of chriſt really abſēt. I wil write in here as Bucer ſpeketh it in latin, expoūdyng the .xxvi. chap. of Mathewe, &amp; thē I will put the ſame in engliſh. Bucers wordes be theſe. Vt ſol verè vno in loco coeli viſibilis circumſcriptus

Verbo Domini ſimpliciter inherendum eſt, &amp; debet fides ſenſuum defectui praebere ſupplementum. Whiche is thus much in Engliſhe. As the ſonne is truly placed determinately in one place of the viſible heauen, and yet is truely &amp; ſubſtantially preſent by meane of his beames elswhere in the worlde abrode: So (our Lorde) although he be comprehended in one place of the ſecret and diuine heauen, that is to ſay, the glorye of his father, yet neuer the leſſe by his worde and holy tokens, he is exhibite preſent truly, whole God and man, &amp; therfore in ſubſtance in his holy ſupper, whiche preſence mannes mynde geuyng credite to his wordes &amp; tokēs with no leſſe certaintie acknowlegeth, then our eyes ſee, &amp; haue the ſōne preſent exhibite

and ſhewed with his corporal light. This is a depe ſecrete matter of the newe teſtamēt, &amp; a matter of faith and therfore herin thoughtes be not to be receyued of ſuche a preſentation of the body, as cōſiſteth in the maner of this lyfe trāſitorie and ſubiecte to ſuffre. We muſt ſimply cleaue to the worde of Chriſt, &amp; fayth muſt releue the defaulte of our ſences. Thus hath Bucer expreſſed his mynd, wher vnto becauſe the ſimilitude of the ſonne doth not anſwer in all partes, he noteth wiſely in thēd, how this is a matter of faith, &amp; therfore vpon the foundatiō of fayth, we muſt ſpeake of it; therby to ſupply where our ſences faile. For the preſence of Chriſt, and hole Chriſte God and man is true, althoughe we can not thinke of the maner (howe). The chief cauſe why I bring in Bucer is this, to ſhewe how in his iugement we haue not only in earth, the operation &amp; vertue of the ſonne, but alſo the ſubſtaunce of the ſonne, by meane of the ſonne beames, which be of the ſame ſuſtaūce with the ſonne, &amp; can not be deuyded in ſubſtaunce from it, &amp; therfore we haue in yerth the ſubſtācial preſence of the ſonne, not onely the operation &amp; vertue. And howſoeuer the ſonne aboue in the diſtaunce appereth vnto vs of an other ſorte, yet the beames that touche the yerth, be of the ſame ſubſtaunce with it (as clerkes ſay) or at the leſt as Bucer ſayth, whom I neuer harde accompted Papiſt, and yet for the reall and ſubſtannciall

preſence of Chriſtes very body in the Sacrament, wryteth pythely &amp; playnly, &amp; here encountreth this auctor, with his ſimilitude of the ſōne directly, whereby may appeare howe muche ſoeuer Bucer is eſtemed otherwiſe, he is not with this auctor regarded in the truth of the Sacrament, which is one of the highe myſteryes in our religion. And this may ſu

                  n he promiſed to be in thaſſemble of ſuche as be gathered together in his name, it is a plaine abolition of the myſterye of the Sacrament, in the woordes wherof Chriſtes humayne body is exhibite &amp; made preſēt with his very fleſhe to feade vs, &amp; to that ſinguler &amp; ſpecial effecte which in thother preſence of Chriſt in thaſſemble made in his name, is not ſpokē of, &amp; it hath no apparaunce of lernyng in ſcriptures, to conclude vnder one cōſideratiō a ſpecialtie, &amp; a generalitie. And therfore it was well anſwered of him that ſaid. If I could tel reaſō, ther wer no faith, If I could ſhewe the like, it wer not ſinguler, whiche both be notable in this ſacramēt, where cōdēpnyng all reaſon, good men both conſtantly beleue that Chriſt ſitteth on the right hande of his father very god &amp; mā, &amp; alſo without chaūge of place, doth neuertheleſſe make himſelfe by his power preſēt, both God &amp; man vnder the forme of bread &amp; wyne, at the prayor of the

Thus I haue peruſed theſe differences, (whiche well conſidered) me thinke ſufficient to take away &amp; appeace all ſuch difference, as might be moued agaynſt the Sacrament, the faith whereof hath euer preuayled againſte ſuche as haue impugned it. And I haue not redde of any that hathe writen againſte it, but ſomewhat hathe agaynſte his entrepriſe in his writynges appeared, whereby to confirme it, or ſo euident vntruthes affirmed, as whereby thoſe that be as indifferent to the truthe, as Salamon was, in the iudgement of the lyuynge childe.

                  rmely to be conceyued in our vnderſtandynges, &amp; in one forme of wordes, to be vttered and preached, which in the booke of common prayor is well termed, not diſtaunt from the Catholique fayth in my iugement. Theſe differences ende in the .xlviii. leef in the ſecond columne I entende nowe to touch the further matter of the booke with the maner of the handelyng of it, and where an euident vntruth is, ther to ioyne an iſſue, and where ſlayte &amp; crafte is ther to note it in the whole.
               The matter of the booke, from thēce vnto the .xlvi. liefe touchyng the beyng of Chriſt in heauen and not in yerth in out of purpoſe ſuperflous. The article of our Crede that Chriſt aſcēded to heauē &amp; ſitteth on the right hand of his father, hath been &amp; is moſt conſtantly beleued of true Chriſten men, which the true faith of Chriſtes real preſence in the Sacramēt doth not touche or empayre. Nor Chriſt beyng wholy God and man in the Sacrament is therby either out of heauen, or to be ſayd conuerſaunt in yearth, becauſe the conuerſation is not yearthly, but ſpirituall, and godly, beyng thaſcenſiō of Chriſt thend of his cōuerſation in yearth, and therfore all that reaſonyng of thauctor, is clerely voyd to trayuaile to proue that is not denied only for a ſleight to make it ſeme as though

it wer denyed.
               After this, the auctor occupyeth a great numbre of leaues, that is to ſay, from the .lvii. leef vnto the .lxxiiii. to proue Chriſtes wordes (This is my body) to be a figuratiue ſpeche. Sleight &amp; ſhifte is vſed in the matter without any effectuall conſecution, to him that is lerned.
               Firſt thauctour ſayth Chriſt called bread his body, Chriſt confeſſed bread his body. To this is anſwered, Chriſtes callyng is a makyng, as S. Paule ſayth, Vocat ea quae non 
                  Rom. 4. 
                  ſunt tanq ea quae ſint, He calleth that be not as they were. And ſo his callyng (as Chriſoſtome and the greke commentaryes ſay is a making, which alſo the Catechiſme teacheth tranſlate by Iuſtus Ionas in Germany, &amp; after by this auctor in Engliſhe. Tertullian Tertullianꝰ aduerſus Marcionē. lib. 4. Cyprianus de ce na domini. ſayth Chriſt made bread his body, and it is al one ſpeche in Chriſt beyng God declaring his ordinaunces, whither he vſe the worde call, or make, for in his mouthe to call is to make. Cyprian ſayth accordyng hereunto howe bread is by Gods omnipotencie made fleſhe, wherupon alſo this ſpeche (bread is fleſhe) is aſmuche to ſay as made fleſhe, not that bread beyng bread is fleſhe, but that was bread is fleſh, by Gods omnipotency, &amp; ſo this auctor entreatyng this matter as he doth, hath partly opened the faith of trāſubſtanciation. For in dede bread beyng bread is not Chriſtes body, but that was bread is

now Chriſtes bod
                     •
                  e becauſe bread is made Chriſtes bodye &amp; becauſe Chriſt called bread his bodye, whiche was in Chriſt to make bread his body. When Chriſt made water wyne, the ſpech is very propre to ſay, water is made wyne. For after like maner of ſpech, we ſay Chriſt iuſtifyeth a wicked manne, Chriſt ſaueth ſynners, and the phyſitiō hath made the ſicke man whole, and ſuche dyet will make an whole man ſycke. All theſe ſpeches be propre and playne, ſo as conſtruction, but not made captious and Sophiſtical to ioyne that was to that nowe is, forgettyng the meane worke. When Chriſte ſayd (This is my body) there is no neceſſitie that the demonſtratiō (this) ſhould be referred to the outwarde viſible matter, but may be referred to the inuiſible ſubſtaunce. As in the ſpeche of God the father vpon Chriſt in Baptiſme: This is my ſonne. And here when this auctor taketh his recreatiō to ſpeake of the fainyng of the papiſtes I ſhal ioyne this Iſſue in this place that he vnderſtādeth not An iſſue. what he ſayth, &amp; if his knowlege be no better then is vttered here in the penne, to be in this poynte clerely cōdēpned of ignoraunce.
               In the .lx. leef thauctor entreateth whither it be a plaine ſpech of chriſt to ſay (Eate &amp; drinke) ſpeakyng of his body and bloud. I anſwer the ſpech of it ſelfe is propre, cōmaū
                  dyng them preſēt to eate and drinke that is proponed for thē, &amp; yet it is not requiſite that

the nature of mā ſhuld with like comon effect worke, in eatyng &amp; drinkyng that heauenly meate &amp; drinke, as it doth in earthely &amp; carnali meates. In this myſterye man doth as Chriſt ordeyned, that is to ſay, receyue with his mouth, that is ordred to be receiued with his mouth, graūtyng it neuertheleſſe of that dignitie &amp; eſtimation, that Chriſtes wordes affirme, &amp; whither he ſo doth or no, Chriſtes ordinaunce is as it is in the ſubſtaunce of it ſelf alone, wherof no good man iudgeth carnally or groſſely ne diſcuſſeth the vnfaythfall queſtiō (how) which he can not cōceyue, but leueth the depenes thereof, &amp; doth as he is bidden. This miſterye receyueth no mans thoughtes. Chriſtes inſtitution hath a propertie in it, whiche can not be diſcuſſed by mans ſenſual reaſō. Chriſtes wordes be ſpirite &amp; life, which this auctour wreſteth with his owne gloſe, to exclud the truth of the eatyng of Chriſtes fleſh in his ſupper. And yet for a ſhifte, if a man would ioyne iſſue with him, putteth to this ſpech the wordes (groſſely) &amp; (carnally) which wordes in ſuche a rude vnderſtandyng, be termes meter to expreſſe howe dogges deuoure paunches, then to be inculked in ſpeakyng of this high myſterye. Wherin I wil make the iſſue with this auctour An iſſue. that no Catholique teaching is ſo fourmed with ſuche termes as though we ſhould eate Chriſtes moſte precious bodye groſſely, carnaly, ioynyng thoſe wordes ſo together,

For els (carnally) alone may haue a good ſignification, as Hilarye vſeth it, but contrarywiſe ſpekyng in the Catholique teachyng of the maner of Chriſtes preſence, they call it a ſpiritual maner of preſence, and yet there is preſent by gods powre the very true natural body &amp; bloud of Chriſt, hole God &amp; man, without leuyng his place in heauen, &amp; in the holy ſupper mē vſe their mouthes and teathe followyng Chriſtes commaundement in the receiuyng of that holy Sacrament, beyng in fayth ſufficiently inſtructe, that they do not ne can not teare, conſume or violate that moſte precious body and bloud but vnworthely receiuyng it are cauſe of theyr owne iugement and condempnation. Nowe I wil touche ſhortely, what maye bee ſayd to the particuler auctorities brought in by this auctor. Origen is noted (among other writers Origenes. of the churche) to drawe the texte to allegories, who doth not therby meane to deſtroye the truth of the lettre, &amp; therfore whē he ſpeketh of a figure, ſayth not there is a only figure, whiche excluſiue (only) beyng away, (as it is not found by any auctor Catholike, taught that the ſpech of Chriſt of the eatyng of his fleſhe to be only a figure.)
               This auctor hath nothyng auaunced his purpoſe. As for ſpiritual vnderſtandyng meaneth not any deſtruction of the lettre where the ſame may ſtande with the rule of our fayth. All Chriſtes wordes be life and

ſpirite containyng in the lettre many tymes that is aboue our capacite, as ſpecially in this place of the eatyng of his fleſh, to diſcuſſe the particularities of (howe) and yet we muſt beleue to be true that Chriſt ſayth (although we can not tell howe:) For whē we go about to diſcuſſe of gods miſterye (howe,) then we fall from fayth, and waxe carnall men, and would haue Gods wayes like ours.
               Sainete Chriſoſtome declareth himſelfe Chriſoſto. howe myſteries muſt be conſidered with inwarde eyes, whiche is a ſpirituall vnderſtandyng, wherby the truth of the myſterye is not, (as it were by a figuratiue ſpech empayred) but with an humilitie of vnderſtandyng in a certaine fayth of the truth merueyled at. And here thauetor of the boke vſeth a ſleight to ioyn figuratiuely to ſpiritually, as though they were alwayes all one, whiche is not ſo.
               Sainct Auguſtine accordyng to his rules Auguſtinus. of a figuratiue and propre ſpeche, taketh this ſpeche. Excepte ye eate. &amp;c. for a figuratiue ſpeche, becauſe it ſemeth to commande in the lettre carnally vnderſtāded, an heynous and a wicked thyng to eate the fleſhe of a man, as mans carnall imaginacion conceyueth it, as appeared by the Capharnites, who murmured at it. And therfore becauſe only faithfull men can by fayth vnderſtande this myſterye of the eatyng of Chriſtes fleſhe in the Sacrament, in whiche we eate not the carnal fleſhe of a commen man as the lettre ſoundeth, but

the very ſpiritual fleſh of Chriſt God &amp; man as fayth teacheth: It is in that reſpecte well noted for a figuratiue ſpeche, for that it hath ſuche a ſence in the lettre as is hidden frō the vnfaithfull, So as the ſame lettre beyng to faithful mē ſpirite &amp; life (who in humilitie of fayth vnderſtand the ſame) is to the vnfaithful a figure, as conteinyng ſuch a myſtery as by the outward barke of the lettre they vnderſtand not: vpon which conſideraciō it ſemeth probable that the other fathers alſo ſignifiyng a great ſecrecie in this myſterye of the ſacramēt, wherin is a worke of god ineffable, ſuche, as (the Ethnike eares could not abide) theitermed it a figure, not therby to diminiſh the truth of the miſterye, as the propre &amp; ſpecial name of a figure doth, but by the name of a figure, reuerently to couer ſo great a ſecrecie, apte only to be vnderſtāded of men beleuyng, &amp; therfore the ſaid fathers in ſome part of their workes, in plaine wordes expreſſe &amp; declare the truth of the myſterye &amp; the plaine doctrine therof accordyng to the Catholique fayth, &amp; in the other part, paſſe it ouer, with the name of a figure, whiche conſideraciō in S. Auguſtins writinges may be euidētly gathered, for in ſome place no mā more plainly openeth the ſubſtance of the Sacramēt, then he doth, ſpeakyng expreſſely of the very body &amp; bloud of Chriſt conteyned in it, &amp; yet therwith in other places noteth in thoſe words a figure, not therby to cōtrary his other playne

                  
                     •
                  aiyngs &amp; doctrin, but meanyng by the word figure, to ſignifie a ſecrete depe miſtery hid dē frō carnal vnderſtādyng: For auoyding &amp; expellyng of whiche carnalitie, he geueth this doctrine here of this texte: Excepte ye eate. &amp;c. whiche (as I ſayd before) in the bare litteral ſence implyeth to carnal iudgemēt, other carnal circunſtances to atteyne the ſame fleſh to be eatē, which in that carnal ſence can not be but by wickednes. But what is this to the obeiyng of Chriſtes cōmaundemet in th inſtituciō of his ſupper, when himſelfe deliuereth his body &amp; bloud in theſe myſteryes, and byddeth; Eate &amp; drinke, there can be no offence to do as Chriſt biddeth, &amp; therfore S. Auguſtins rule perteyneth not to Chriſtes ſupper, wher in when Chriſt willeth vs to vſe our mouth, we ought to dare do as he biddeth for that is ſpirituall vnderſtandyng to do as is cōmanded without carnall thought or murmuryng in our ſenſuall diuiſe howe it can be ſo. And ſainct Auguſtine in the ſame place ſpeakyng de communicādo paſsionibus Chriſti, declareth plainely he meaneth of the Sacrament.
               Tertullian ſpeakyng of there preſent aciō 
                  Tertul. of Chriſtes very body, in which place he termeth it (the ſame body) ſpeaketh catholiquely in ſuche phraſe as S. Hierome ſpeaketh, and thē Tertulilā ſaith afterwarde as this auctor therin truely bryngeth him forth, that Chriſt made the bred his body, which bread was in the mouth of the pphet a figure of his body.

Wherfore it foloweth by Tertullians cōfeſſion when Chriſt made the bread his body, that Chriſt ended the figure, and made it the truth, making now his body that was before the figure of his body. For if Chriſt did no more but make it a figure ſtyl, thē did he not make it his body as Tertullian himſelf ſaith he did. And Tertullian therfore, beyng red thus, as appeareth to be moſt probable that (that is to ſay in Turtullian) ſhould be onely referred to the explicaciō of the firſt (this) as when Turtulliā had alleged Chriſts words ſaiyng (this is my body) &amp; putteth to of his owne (that is to ſay the figure of my body,) theſe wordes (that is to ſay) ſhould ſerue to declare the demonſtracion (this,) in this wiſe (that is to ſay) this, which the prophet called the figure of my body, is nowe my body, &amp; ſo Tertullian ſayd before that Chriſt had made bread his body, which bread was a figure of his body with the prophete, &amp; nowe endeth in the very truth, beyng made his body by conuerſiō as (Cypriā ſheweth) of the nature of bread into his body. Tertullian reaſoned againſt the Marcioniſtes, &amp; becauſe a figure in the prophete ſignifieth a certayne vnfayned truth of that is ſignified, ſeyng Chriſtes bodye was figured by bread in the prophete Hieremy. It appeareth Chriſt had a true body. And that the bread was of Chriſt approued for a figure, he made it nowe his very body. And this may be ſayd euidētly to Tertullian,

who reaſonyng againſt heretiques vſeth the commoditie of arguyng, and geueth no doctrine of the Sacrament to further this auctors purpoſe. And what aduātage ſhould theretiques haue of Tertullian if he ſhould meane, that theſe wordes, This is my body, had only this ſence, This is the figure of my body, hauing himſelf ſayd before, that Chriſt made bread his body. If ſo plaine ſpeache to make bread his body, conteineth no more certaintie in vnderſtandyng but the figure of a body? why ſhould not they ſay, that a body in Chriſt ſhould euer be ſpoken of a body in a figure, and ſo no certaintie of any true body in Chriſt by Tertullians wordes. This place of Tertullian is no ſecrete poynte of lernyng, &amp; hath been of Decolampadius &amp; other alleged &amp; by other catholique men anſwered vnto it, wherof this auctor may not thinke nowe as vpon a wranglyng argument, to ſatiſfie a coniecture diuiſed, therby to confirme a newe teachyng. Fynally Tertullian termeth it not an onely figure (whiche this auctor muſte proue) or els he doth nothyng.
               Cyprian ſhalbe touched after, when we Cypriā
                   ſpeake of him againe.
               Chriſoſtome ſhall open himſelfe hereafter Chryſoſto. Hiero. plainely.
               Saint Hierome ſpeketh here very pithely, vſyng the worde (repreſent) which ſignifieth a true real exhibiciō: for ſainct Hierome ſpeaketh of the repreſentacion of the truth of

Chriſtes body, which truth excludeth an only figure. For howſoeuer the viſible matter of the ſacrament be a fignre, the inuiſible parte is a truth: Whiche ſaincre Hierome ſayth is here repreſented (that is to ſay) made preſēt, which only ſignification doth not.
               Sainct Ambroſe ſhall after declare himſelfe, Ambroſius. &amp; it is not denyed, but thauctors in ſpekyng of the Sacrament vſed theſe wordes, ſigne, figure, ſimilitude, tokē, but thoſe ſpeaches exclude not the veritie &amp; truth of the body &amp; bloud of Chriſt, for no approued auctor hath this excluſiue, to ſay an onely ſigne, an only tokē, an only ſimilitude, or an only ſignificacion whiche is the iſſue with this auctor.
               As for Sainct Auguſtine (ad Bonifacium) 
                  Auguſtinus. thauctor ſhall perceiue his faulte at Martyn Bucers hand, who in his epiſtel dedicatorye of his enarracions of the goſpels, reherſeth his mynde of Sainct Auguſtine in this wiſe. Eſt (ſcribit diuus Auguſtinus) Secundū quē
                     dam 
                  Bucerꝰ. 
                  modum ſacramentum corporis Chriſti, corpus Chriſti, ſacramētum ſanguinis Chriſti, ſanguis Chriſti: At ſecundū quem modū? Vt ſignificet tantum corpus &amp; ſanguinē Domini abſentia? Abſit, Honorari enim &amp; percipi in Symbolis viſibilibus corpus &amp; ſanguinē Domini, idē paſsim ſcribit. Theſe wordes of Bucer may be thus engliſhed. Saincte Auguſtine writeth, the Sacrament of the body of Chriſt is after a certaine maner, the body of Chriſt, the Sacramēt of the bloud of Chriſt,

the bloud of Chriſt, But after what maner? that it ſhould ſignifie onely the body &amp; bloud abſēt? Abſit. In no wiſe: For the ſame S. Auguſtin writeth in many places, the body and bloud of Chriſt to be honored, &amp; to be receiued in thoſe viſible tokens. Thus ſayth Bucer, who vnderſtandeth not S. Auguſtine to ſay the ſacramēt of Chriſtes body, to be Chriſtes body after a certaine maner of ſpech, as this auctor doth: nor S. Auguſtine hath no ſuche wordes, but only (ſecundum quendā modū) after a certaine maner, whervnto to put (of ſpeche) is an addition more then truth required of neceſſite. In theſe words of Bucer may appeare his whole iugemēt cōcernyng S. Auguſtin, who affirmeth the very true preſence of the thing ſignified in the ſacramēt, whiche truth eſtabliſhed in the matter, the callyng it a ſigne, or a token, a figure, a ſimilitude, or a ſhe wyng, maketh no matter whē we vnderſtād the thyng really preſēt that is ſignified, Which &amp; it wer not in dede in the Sacramēt, why ſhuld it after Bucers true vnderſtāding of S. Auguſtine be honored there? Arguyng vpō mens ſpeaches, may be without ende, &amp; thauctor vpō diuerſe reſpectes ſpeake of one thyng diuerſely. Therfore we ſhould reſorte to the pyth and knot of the matter, and ſee what they ſaye in expoundyng the ſpeciall place, without contenciō, &amp; not what they vtter in the heat of their diſputaciō, ne to ſerch the darke &amp; ambiguous places, wherwith to

cōfounde that they ſpeake openly &amp; plainely.
               Thauctor bringeth in Theodoret a greke, Theodoretꝰ. whom to diſcuſſe particulerly, wer long and tedious: one notable place there is in him, whiche toucheth the poynte of the matter, which place Peter martyr allegeth in greke, &amp; then tranſlateth it into Latin, not exactely as other haue done to the truthe, but as he hath done, I will write in here. And then wil I write the ſame tranſlate into Engliſhe by one that hath trāſlate Peter Martyrs boke, and then will I adde the tranſlation of this auctor, and finally, the very truth of the Latyn, as I will abyde by, &amp; ioyne an iſſue with this auctor in it, wherby thou reder ſhalt perceiue with what ſinceritie thinges be hādled.
               Peter Martyr hath of Theodorete this in Latyn, whiche the ſame Theodorete in a diſputacion P. Martyr. with an heretique, maketh the Catholique man to ſay. Captusies ijs quae tetenderas retibus. Ne
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      enim poſt ſanctificationē, myſtica ſymbola illa propria ſua natura egrediuntur, manent enim in priori ſua ſubſtācia, &amp; figura, &amp; ſpecie, adeo
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      &amp; videntur, &amp; palpantur, quc̄admodum &amp; antea. Intelliguntur autem quae facta ſunt, &amp; creduntur, &amp; adorā
                     tur, tanquam ea exiſtentia, quae creduntur. He that trāſlated Peter martyr in Engliſhe dothe expreſſe theſe wordes thus. Lo thou art now caught in the ſame net whiche thou haddeſt ſet to catche me in. For thoſe ſame

myſtical ſignes, do not departe awaie out of their owne propre nature, after the halowyng of thē. For they remayne ſtyll in their former ſubſtaunce, and their former ſhape, and their former kinde, and are euen aſwell ſeen and felt as they were afore. But the thynges that are done are vnderſtanded and are beleued, and are worſhipped, euen as though they were in verye dede, the thinges that are beleued. This is the common tranſlation in to Engliſhe in Peter martyrs booke tranſlated, whiche this auctor doth trāſlate after his facion thus. Thou arte taken with thine owne nette, for the Sacramētal ſignes go not from their owne nature after the ſanctification, but continue in their former ſubſtaunce, forme and figure, and bee ſeen and touched aſwel as before. Yet in our myndes we conſidre what they be made, &amp; dorepute and eſteme them, and haue them in reuerence accordyng to the ſame thynges, that they be taken for. Thus is the tranſlation of this auctor. Myne Engliſhe of this Latyn is thus.
               Thou art takē with the ſame nettes thou diddeſt lay forth. For the myſtical tokens, after the ſanctification go nota way, out of their propre nature. For they abyde in their former ſubſtance, ſhape and forme, &amp; ſo farfurth, that they may bee ſeen and felt as they might before. But they be vnderſtanded that they be made, &amp; are beleued, &amp; are worſhipped, as beyng the ſame thynges, whiche be

beleued. This is my tranſlation who in the firſt ſētēce meane not to vary from the other tranſlations touchyng the remayne of ſubſtaunce, ſhape, forme, or figure, I will vſe all thoſe names. But in the ſeconde parte where Theodorete ſpeaketh of oure beleef what the tokēs be made, and where he ſaith thoſe tokens be worſhipped, as beyng the ſame thynges, which be beleued, thou mayſt ſee reader howe this auctour flyeth the wordes (beleue) and (worſhip) whiche the cōmon tranſlation in engliſhe dothe playnely and truely expreſſe, howe ſoeuer that tranſlator ſwarued by colour of the word (tāquam) which there, after the greke, ſignifieth the truth &amp; not the ſimilitude only, like as in ſamet Paule (Vocat ea quae non ſunt tāquam ſint) which is to make to be in dede, not as though they were, And the greke is the 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   as it is here 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . And it were an abſurditie, to beleue thynges otherwiſe thē they be, as though they wer, &amp; very Idolatrie to worſhip that is not, as though it were in dede. And therfore in theſe two wordes that they be beleued, that they bee made &amp; be worſhiped, is declared by Theodorete, his fayth of the very true real preſēce of Chriſtes glorious fleſhe, whervnto the deite is vnite: which fleſhe. S. Auguſtine cōſonātly to this Theodorete ſaid, muſt be worſhipped before it be receyued. The worde worſhippyng

put here in Engliſhe is to expreſſe the worde (Adorātur) put by Peter in latyn, ſignifiyng adoring, beyng the verbe in greke of ſuche ſignifycation, as is vſed to expreſſe godly worſhippe with bowyng of the knee. Now reader, what ſhould I ſay by this auctor, that conueyeth theſe two wordes, of beleuyng, and worſhippyng, and in ſtede of thē, cōmeth in with reuerence, takyng, reputyng, &amp; eſtemyng: wherof thou mayſt eſteme howe this place of Theodorete pinched this auctor, who could not but ſe that adoryng of the. Sacramēt ſignifieth the preſence of the body of Chriſt to be adored, which els were an abſurditie, &amp; therfore thauctor toke paine to eaſe it with other wordes of callyng, beleuyng, reputyng, &amp; eſtemyng, &amp; for Adoratiō, Reuerēce. Conſider what prayſe this auctor geueth Theodorete, which prayſe condempneth this auctor ſore. For Theodorete in his doctrine would haue vs beleue the miſtery, &amp; adore the ſacramēt: where this auctor after in his doctrine profeſſeth, ther is nothyng to be worſhipped at al. If one ſhould nowe ſay to me, yeaſyr, but this Theodorete ſemeth to condēpne tranſubſtantiation, becauſe he ſpeketh ſo of the bread, Thervnto ſhalbe anſwered when I ſpeake of tranſubſtanciation, whiche ſhalbe the laſte. For before the truth of the preſence of the ſubſtaunce of Chriſtes body may appeare, what ſhould we talke of tranſubſtanciation, I will trauaile no more

in Theodoret, but leaue it to thy iudgement reader, what credite this auctor ought to haue that hādleth the mater after this ſorte.
               As for the vſe of figuratiue ſpeches to be accuſtumed in ſcripture is not denyed. But Philip Melancton in an epiſtel to Decolampadius Melancton. of the Sacrement, geueth one good note of obſeruation in difference betwene the ſpeches in gods ordinaunces &amp; commaundementes, and otherwiſe. For if in thunderſtā
                  dyng of gods ordinaunces and commaundementes, figures may be often receyued: truth ſhall by allegories be ſhortely ſubuerted and all our religion reduced to ſignifications. There is no ſpeache ſo plaine and ſimple, but it hath ſōne peice of a figuratiue ſpeache, but ſuch as expreſſeth the common plaine vnderſtandyng, and then the common vſe of the figure cauſeth it to be taken as a common propre ſpeache, As theſe ſpeches, drinke vp this cup or eate this diſhe, is in dede a figuratiue ſpeche, but by cuſtume made ſo common that it is reputed the plaine ſpech, becauſe it hath but one only vnderſtādyng commonly receyued. And when Chriſt ſayd: This cuppe is the newe teſtament: the propre ſpeche therof in lettre, hath an abſurdite in reaſon &amp; fayth alſo. But whē Chriſt ſayd, This is my body, although the truth of the litteral ſence hath an abſurditie in carnall reaſon, yet hath it no abſurditie in humilite of fayth nor repugneth not to any other truthe of ſcripture.

And ſeyng it is a ſinguler miracle of Chriſt wherby to exerciſe vs in the fayth, vnderſtā
                  ded as the plaine wordes ſignifie in their propre ſence, there can no reaſonyng be made of other figuratiue ſpeches to make this to be their felowe and like vnto them. No man denyeth the vſe of figuratiue ſpeaches in Chriſtes ſupper, but ſuche as be equal with plaine propre ſpech, or be expoūded by other Euangeliſtes in plaine ſpeche.
               In the .lxxiiii. leef this auctor goth about to geue a general ſolution to all that may be ſaid of Chriſtes beyng in yearth, in heauē, or the. Sacrament, and geueth inſtructiōs how theſe wordes of Chriſtes diuine nature figuratiuely, ſpiritually, really, carnally, corpoporally, may be placed, and thus he ſayth: Chriſt in his diuine nature may be ſayd to be in the earth figuratiuely in the ſacramēt, ſpiritually in the man that receiueth, but really, carnally, corporally, only in heauē. Let vs cō
                  ſider the placyng of theſe termes. When we ſay chriſtis in his diuine nature euery wher, is he not alſo really euery where, accordyng to the true eſſēce of his godhed in dede euery where, that is to ſay, not in fanſye nor imagination, but verely, truely, &amp; therfore really as we beleue ſo in dede euery where? And when Chriſte is ſpiritually in good men by grace, is not Chriſte in them really by grace? but in fanſye and imagination? And therfore whatſoeuer this auctor ſayth the worde

really may not haue ſuch reſtraint, to be referred only to heauē, onles the auctor would deny the ſubſtaunce of the godhed, which as it cōprehendeth all beyng incōprehenſible, &amp; is euery wher without limitatiō of place, ſo as it is, truly it is, in dede is, &amp; therfore really is, &amp; therfore of Chriſt muſt be ſayd, wherſouer he is in his diuine nature by powre or grace, he is ther really, whither we ſpeake of heauē or yearth. As for the termes carnally, &amp; corporaly, as this auctor ſemeth to vſe thē, in other places of his booke, to expreſſe the maner of preſence of the humayne nature in Chriſt, I meruayle by what ſcripture he wil proue that Chriſtes body is ſo carnally and corporally in heauen, we be aſſured by fayth grounded vpon the ſcriptures of the truth of the beyng of Chriſtes fleſhe and body there, and the ſame to be a true fleſhe, and a true bodye, but yet in ſuche ſence as this auctor uſeth the termes carnai and corporal againſt the Sacrament, to implie a groſſenes, he can not ſo attribute thoſe termes to Chriſtes body in heauen. S. Auguſtine after the groſſe Augu. de ciui tate dei Grego. Naziā
                     zenꝰ de baptiſmo. ſence of carnally, ſayth: Chriſt reigneth not carnally in heauen. And Gregorie Naziāzen ſayth: Although Chriſt ſhall come in the laſt day to iudge, ſo as he ſhalbe ſeen, yet there is in him no groſſenes he ſayth. And referreth the maner of his beyng to his knowlege only. And our reſurrection ſainct Auguſtine

ſayth, althoughe it ſhalbe of our true fleſhe: yet it ſhall not be carnally. And when this auctour hath diffamed as it were the termes carnally, and corporally, as termes of groſſenes, to whom he vſed alwaies to put as an aduerſatiue, the terme ſpiritually, as thought carnally, and ſpiritually might not agre in one. Nowe he would for al that, place them in heauen, where is no carnalitie, but all the maner of beyng, ſpirituall, where is noo groſſenes at all, the ſecrecie of the maner of whiche life, is hidden from us, and ſuche as eye hath not ſeen, or eare herd, or aſcended in to the heart and thought of man. I knowe theſe termes carnally and corporally maye haue a good vnderſtandyng out of the mouth of him that had not diffamed them with groſſenes or made them aduerſaryes to ſpirituall, and a man may ſaye Chriſt is corporally in heauen, becauſe the truth of his bodye is there, and carnally in heauen, becauſe his fleſhe is truely there, but in this vnderſtandyng both the wordes carnally and corporally, may be copled with the worde ſpiritually, which is againſt this auctors teaching who appointeth the worde ſpiritually to be ſpokē of Chriſtes preſēce in the mā that receiued the ſacramēt worthely, which ſpeech I do not diſalowe, but as Chriſt is ſpiritually in the man that dothe receyue worthely the Sacrament: So is he in him ſpiritually before hereceyue, orels he can not

receiue worthely as I haue before ſayd. And by this appereth howe this auctor to frame his general ſolution hath vſed neither of the termes, really, carnally, corporally, or ſpiritually in a conuenient ordre, but hath in his diſtribution myſuſed them notably. For Chriſte in his diuine nature is really euerye where, and in his humayne nature is carnally and corporally as theſe wordes ſignifie ſubſtaunce of fleſhe and bodye continually in heauen to the daye of iudgement: &amp; neuertheleſſe after that ſignification preſēt in the Sacramēt alſo. And in thoſe termes in that ſignification the fathers haue ſpoken of the Sacrament as in the particuler ſolutions to 
                     〈…〉
                  tours hereafter ſhal appeare. Mary as touchyng the vſe of the worde figuratiuely, to ſaye that Chriſte is figuratiuely in the bread and wyne, is a ſaiyng whiche this aucro
                     ••
                   hath not proued at all, but is a doctrine before this diuerſe tymes reproued &amp; nowe by this auctour in England renewed.
               Let vs nowe conſider what particuler anſwers this auctor diuiſeth to make to the fathers of the church, and firſt what he ſaith to ſainct Elementes Epiſtel, his handelyng wherof is worthie to be noted.
               Firſt, he ſayth the Epiſtel is not Clementes but fayned as he ſayth many other thynges Clement. be for their purpoſe (he ſayth,) whiche ſolution is ſhorte and may be ſone learned of noughty men and noughtly applied further

as they liſte: But this I may ſay, if this Epiſtel wer fayned of the Bapiſtes, then do they ſhewe themſelfe fooles, that could fayne no better but ſo as this auctor mighte of their fayned Epiſtell gather thre notes againſte them. This auctors notes be theſe. Firſt that the bread in the ſacramēt is called the Lords body, and that the brokē bread be called the peces and fragmentes of the Lordes body. Marke well reader this note that ſpeaketh ſo muche of bread, where the wordes of the Epiſtell, in the parte here alleged name no bread at all. If this auctor hath red ſo much mencion of bread in any other parte of the Epiſtel, why bryngeth he not that forth to fortifie his note? I haue red after in the ſame Epiſtel (panes ſanctuarij) but they would not helpe this auctors note, and yet for the other matter ioyned with them, they would ſlaundre an other way. And therfore feyng this auctor hath lefte them out, I will go no further thē is here alleged. The callyng of bread by enunciation, for a name is not material, becauſe it ſignifieth that was, but in that is here alleged, is no mention of bread to proue the note, and to faythfull men, the wordes of the Epiſtel, reuerently expreſſe the remayne of the myſteryes, in which whē many hoſtes be offered in the aultare, accordynge to the multitude that ſhoulde communicate, thoſe many hoſtes, after conſecracion, be not many bodyes of Chriſte, but of many breades one

body of Chriſt, &amp; yet as we teach in England nowe, in the booke of comōprayour, in euery parte of that is broken, is the hole body of our ſauiour Chriſt. Mannes wordes can not ſuffice to expreſſe gods myſteryes, nor cānot vttre them ſo, as frowarde reaſon ſhall not fynde matter to wrangle. And yet, to ſtaye reaſon, maye ſuffiſe, that as in one loofe of bread broken, euery piece brokē, is a piece of that bread, &amp; euery piece of the bread brokē, is in it ſelfe a whole piece of bread, for euery piece hath an hole ſubſtaunce of bread in it. So we truely ſpeake of the hooſte cōſecrate, to auoyde the fanſie of multiplicaciō of Chriſtes body, which in al the hoſtes, &amp; all partes of the hooſtes is but one, not brokē, nor diſtribute by pieces, &amp; yet in a ſpech to tel, &amp; ſignifie that is brokē, called in name the leauing pieces of the body, portiō of the body, reſidue of the body, in which neuerthleſſe, eche one pece is chriſts hole body. So as this ſpech hauing a figure, hath it of neceſſitie, to auoyde the abſurditie, wherby to ſignifie a multitude of bodyes, which is not ſo, &amp; the ſoūde of the ſpech chriſten eares do abhorre. But this I aſke, where is the mater of this auctors note, that bread is called Chriſts body? where, there is no worde of bread, in the words alleged, &amp; if there were, as ther is not, it were worthy no note at all. For that name is not abhorred, &amp; the catholique faith teacheth that the fractiō is in the outwarde ſigne, &amp; not in the body of Chriſt, inuiſibly preſent, &amp; ſignified, ſo to be

preſent by that viſible ſigne? The ſecōde note of this auctor is, touchyng reſeruyng which Clemēt might ſeme to denye, becauſe he ordred the remaine, to be receiued of the clerks, thinkyng ſo beſt: not declaryng expreſſly that nothyng might be reſerued, to the vſe of thē that be abſet. The cōtrary wherof, appereth by Iuſtine the Martyr, who teſtifieth a reſeruaciō 
                  Iuſtinꝰ apol. ij. to be ſēt to thē that were ſycke, who, &amp; they dwell far from the church (as they do in ſūme places) it may by chaūce in the way, or trouble in the ſicke mā, tary till the morning, or it be receiued. And Cyril writech expreſſly, Cyrillꝰ ad Caloſiriū. that in caſe it ſo doth, the myſtical benedictiō (by which termes he calleth the ſacramēt) remayneth ſtil in force. Whē this auctor findeth faulte, at hāgyng vp of the ſacramēt, he blameth only his owne coūtry &amp; the Iſles hereabout, which faulte, linnehod, after he had traueyled other coūtryes foūde here, beyng the maner of cuſtodye in reſeruaciō otherwiſe vſed thē in other partyes. But one thyng, this auctor ſhould haue noted of Clemēts words, whē he ſpaketh of fearyng &amp; trēblyng, which &amp; the bread were neuer the holyer, as this auctor teacheth, &amp; but only a ſignification, why ſhuld any mā feare or trēble, more in their preſence, thē he doth whē he heareth of Chriſts ſupper, the goſpel red, or himſelf, or an other ſaiyng his Crede, which in words ſignifie aſ much as the bread doth, if it be but a ſignificaciō? And peter martyr ſaith, that words ſignifie Peter Marty

more clerely, then theſe ſignes do, &amp; ſayth further in his diſputaciō with Chedſay, that we receyue the bodye of Chriſte, no leſſe by wordes, then by the Sacramentall ſignes, whiche teachyng (if it were true) why ſhould this Sacrament be trembled at? But becauſe this auctor noteth the Epiſtel of Clement to be fayned, I will not make with him any foū
                  dacion of it, but note to the reader the thyrde note, gathered by this auctor of Clementes woordes, whiche is, that Prieſtes ought not to receyue alone, which the wordes of the piſtle proue not. It ſheweth in dede what was done, &amp; howe the feaſt is in dede prepared for the people, as well as the Prieſt. And I neuer redde any thyng of ordre in lawe or ceremonie, for biddyng the people to cōmunicate with the Prieſt, but all the olde prayours &amp; ceremonyes ſounded as the people did cōmunicate with the Prieſt. And when the people is prepared for, &amp; then come not, but fearyng and tremblyng forbere to come, that then the Prieſt might not receyue his parte alone, the wordes of this Epiſtel ſhewe not. And Clement in that he ſpeaketh ſo of leuynges, ſemeth to thinke of that caſe of diſapointment of the people that ſhould comme, prouydyng in that caſe the clerkes to receyue the reſidue, wherby ſhould appere (if there were not ſtore of clerkes) but only one clerke, as ſome poore churches haue no mo, then a mā might rather make a note of Clemētes mynde, that in that

caſe one Prieſt might receyue alone, &amp; ſo vpō a chaunce kepe the feaſt alone. But what ſoener we may gather, that note of this auctour remayneth vnproued: that the Prieſt ought not to receiue alone. And here I dare therfore ioyne an iſſue with this auctor, that none of An iſſue. his thre fayned notes is grounded of any wordes of this, that he noteth a fayned Epiſtel, takyng the only wordes that he allegeth here. This auctor vpō occaſiō of this Epiſtel, which he calleth fayned, ſpeaketh more reuerently of the Sacramēt then he doth in other places, whiche me thinke worthy to be noted of me. Here he ſaith that very Chriſt himſelf is not only repreſēted, but alſo ſpiritually geuen vnto vs in this table, for ſo I vnderſtāde the worde (wherin.) And then if very Chriſt himſelfe be repreſented &amp; geuen in the table, the auctor meaneth not the material table, but by the word table, the meate vpō the table, as the worde Menſa, a table doth ſignifie in the .xvi. of thactes, &amp; the .x. to the Corinthi. Actes. 16 i. Co. 10. Now if very Chriſt himſelfe be geuen in the meate, thē is he preſent in the meate to be geuen: So as by this teachyng very Chriſt himſelf is not only figuratiuely in the table, that is to ſay, the meate of the table, whiche this auctor nowe calleth repreſentyng, but is alſo ſpiritually geuē in the table, as theſe words ſounde to me. But whither (this auctor will ſay) very Chriſt himſelfe is geuen ſpiritually in the meat, or by the meat, or with the meat,

what ſcripture hath he toꝓue that, he ſaith if the words of chriſt be only a figuratiue ſpech &amp; the bread only ſignifie Chriſts body? For if the wordes, of the inſtituciō be but in figure, mā cānot adde of his diuiſe, anyother ſubſtāce or effect, thē the words of chriſt purport, &amp; ſo this ſupper, after this auctors teachyng, in other places of his boke, wher hewould haue it but a ſignificatiō, ſhal be a bare memorie of chriſtsdeath, &amp; ſignifie oniy ſuch cōmunicaciō of Chriſt, as we haue otherwiſe by faith in that benefite of his paſſiō, without any ſpecial cōmunication of the ſubſtance of his fleſh in this Sacrament, beyng the ſame only a figure, if it were true, that this auctor, would perſuade in the concluſion of this booke, although by the waye he ſayth otherwiſe, for fear percaſe, &amp; trēbling, that he cōceiueth euē of an Epiſtle, which him ſelf ſayth is fayned.
               This auctor ſayth he paſſeth ouer Ignatiꝰ Ignatiꝰ Ireneꝰ. &amp; ireneus, &amp; why? becauſe thei make nothing (he ſayth) for the papiſts purpoſed with the word papiſt thauctor plaieth at his pleaſure. But it ſhalbe euidēt, that Irene doth plainly cōfoūde this auctors purpoſe, in the denial of the true preſēce of Chriſts very fleſh in the ſa cramēt: who although he vſe not the wordes real, &amp; ſubſtācial, yet he doth effectually cōpre hēd in his ſpeach of the ſacramēt, the vertue, &amp; ſirēght of thoſe words. And for the truth of the ſacramēt, is Ireneus ſpecially alleged, in ſo much, as Melanghton, whē he writeth to

                     ict. Occolāpadius, that he will allege none, but ſuch as ſpeake plainly, he allegeth Ireneus

for one, as appereth by his ſaid Epiſtle to Oecolāpadius. And Oecolāpadius him ſelf is not trubled ſomuch with anſweryng any other to ſhape any maner of euaſiō, as to anſwer Ireneus, in whō he notably ſtūbleth. And Peter Martyr, in his worke, graunteth Irene, to be ſpecially alleged, to whō (whē he goeth about to anſwer) a mā may euidētly ſee how he maſketh him ſelf. And this auctor bryngeth in Clemēts epiſtel, of which no great count is made, although it be not cōtēpned, &amp; paſſeth ouer ireneus, that ſpeaketh euidently in the matter, &amp; was as old as Clemēt or not much yōger. And becauſe, Ignatiꝰ was of that age, &amp; is alleged by Theodorete, to haue writē ī his Epiſtle (ad 
                  Theodorete Dialogo .iij. 
                  Smirnēſes) wherof may appere his faith of the miſtery of the Sacramēt, it ſhal ſerue to good purpoſe, towrite ī the words of the ſame ignatius hervpō the credite of the ſaid Theodorer, whō this auctor ſo much cōmēdeth, the words of ignatius be theſe, Euchariſtias &amp; oblationes nō admittūt, ꝙ nō confiteātur, euchariſtiā eſſe carnē ſeruatoris noſtri Ieſu Chriſti, q̄ pro peccatis noſtris, paſſa eſt, 
                        
                           
                        
                        quam
                      pater ſua benignitate ſuſcitauit. Which words, be thus much ī Engliſh They do not admit (Euchariſtias &amp; oblatiōs) be cauſe they do not cōfeſſe, Euchariſtiā, to be the fleſh of our ſauiour ieſu Chriſt: which fleſh ſufred for our ſines, which fleſh, the the father by his beniguitie, hath ſtirred vp. Theſe be Ignatiue words, which I haue not throughly engliſhed, becauſe the word (Euchariſtia) cā not be wel Engliſhed, beyng a word of miſtery, and

(as Ireneus openeth both the partes of the ſacramēt, heuēly &amp; earthly, viſible &amp; inuiſible. But in that, ignatius openeth his fayth thus as he taketh Euchariſtia, to be the fleſh of our ſauior Chriſt that ſuffred for vs, he declareth the ſence of Chriſts wordes: this is my body: not to be figuratiue only, but to expreſſe the truth of the very fleſh there geuen, &amp; therfore (Ignatius ſayth) Euchariſtia, is the fleſhe of our ſauior Chriſt, the ſame that ſuffred, &amp; the ſame that roſe agayn, which words of Ignatius ſo pithely opē the matter, as they declare. therwith that fayth alſo of Theodorete that doth allege him, ſo as if this auctor would make ſo abſolute a worke, as to peruſcal the fathers ſaiynges: he ſhuld not thus lepe ouer Ignatiꝰ, nor Irene neither, as I haue before declared. But this is a color of Rhethorike called (reiectiō) of that is hard to anſwer, &amp; is her a pretie ſhift or ſlaight, wherby (thou reader) maiſt conſider how this matter is handled.
               As touching Dioniſius, a wiſe reader may Dionyſius. without any note of mine, ſe how this auctor is troubled in him, &amp; calleth for ayde, the help of him that made the greke cōmentaries vpō dioniſius, &amp; pledeth therwith the forme of the words really, corporally, ſēſibly, &amp; naturally wherof two, that is to ſay, really &amp; ſēſibly, the olde auctors in ſillables vſed not, for ſomuch as I haue red, but corporally &amp; naturaly they vſed, ſpekyng of this ſacramēt. This dioniſe ſpake of this myſtery after the dignitie of it, not contendyng with any other for the truth

of it, as we do nowe: but extollynge it, as a merueilous high miſterie, which if the bread be neuer the holier, and were only a ſignification, as (this auctor teacheth,) were no high miſtery at all. As for the thynges of the Sacrament to be in heauen, the church teacheth ſo, and yet the ſame thynges be in dede preſent in the Sacramēt alſo, which is a miſterie ſo deape and darke from mannes natural capacitie, as is onely to be beleued ſupernaturally, without aſkyng of the queſtion (how) whereof. S. Chriſoſtome makethe an Chryſoſtomus de Sacerdo. li. 3. exclamation in this wiſe.
               O greate bene volence of God towardes vs, he that ſitteth aboue with the father, at the ſame houre, is holdē here with the hādes of all men, and geueth himſelfe to them that will clapſe and embrace him. Thus ſayth Chriſoſtome cōfeſſyng to be aboue, and here the ſame thynges at ones, not onely in mens breſtes, but hādes alſo, to declare the inward worke of God, in the ſubſtaunce of the viſible Sacrament, wherby Chriſt is preſent in the middes of our ſences, and ſo may be called ſenſibly preſent, although mannes ſēces can not comprehende and feale, or taſte of him in theyr propre nature. But as for this dioniſe doth without argument declare his fayth in thadoration he maketh of this Sacrament, whiche is openly teſtified in his workes, ſo as we nedde not doubte what his fayth was.

The ſeconde note gathered of Tertulian by this auctor, is not true, for Chriſt called it his body, &amp; made it his body, as Tertullian ſayth. And the thirde note of this auctor is in cōtrauerſy of readyng, &amp; muſt be ſo vnderſtāded, as maye agree with the reſt of Tertullians ſaynges, which after my readyng, doth euidently proue, &amp; at the leſt dothe not improue the Catholique doctrine of Chriſtes churche vniuerſally receiued, althoughe it improueth that which (this auctor) calleth here our Catholique doctrine, moſt impudently, and vntruely reportynge the ſame.

Paule ſayth as manny as be Baptized be clade in Chriſte. Nowe in the Sacremēt of bread &amp; wyne (by Origēs rule) Chriſt ſhuld be manifeſtie &amp; exhibitie vnto vs after the ſcriptures, So as the Sacremēt of bread &amp; wyne, ſhould not onely ſignifie Chriſt (that is to ſay) preach him, but alſo exhibite him ſēſible (as Origenes words be reaported) here to be. so as Chriſtes words (this is my body) ſhould be wordsnot of figure &amp; ſheuyng, but of exhibityng Chriſtes body vnto vs, &amp; ſenſibly, as this auctor allegeth him, whiche ſhould ſignifie to be receiued with our moueth, as chriſt cōmaūded, whē he ſaid, take eat, &amp;c. diuerſly frō thother two waies, in whiche by Chriſtes ſpirite, we be made participaunt, of the benefit of his paſſion wroght in his manhode. But in this Sacrament, we be made participaunt, of his Godhode, by his humanite exhibite vnto vs for fode, &amp; ſo in this myſterie, we receyue him man &amp; god, &amp; in thother, by meane of his god head, be participat, of the effect of his paſſion

ſuffred in his manhead. In this Sacrament Chriſtes manhead is repreſēted &amp; truely preſēt, wher vnto the godhead is moſte certainly vnited, whereby we receyue a pledge of the regeneratiō of our fleſhe, to be in the general reſurrection ſpiritual with oure ſoule, as we haue been in Baptiſme made ſpirituall by regeneration of the ſoule, which in the full redemption of our bodies, ſhal be made perfite. And therfore (this auctor) may not compare Baptiſme, with the Sacramēt throughly, in whiche Baptiſme, Chriſtes manhode is not really preſent (althoughe the vertue &amp; effecte of his moſt precious bloude be there) but the truth of the myſterie of this Sacramēt is to haue Chriſtes body his fleſh and bloud exhibited, wherevnto, eatyng &amp; drinkyng is by Chriſt in his ſupper appropriate, In whiche ſupper, Chriſt ſaid: (This is my body) which Bucer noteth, and that Chriſt ſayd not, this is my ſprit, this is my vertue wherfore after, Origens teachyng, if Chriſt be not only manifeſted, but alſo exhibitie ſēſibly in the Sacrament: then is he in the Sacramēt in dede (that is to ſay) really, and then is he there ſubſtanetally, becauſe the ſubſtaunce of the bodye is there, and is there corporally al ſo, becauſe the very bodye is there, &amp; naturall

                  An iſſue. of Hilarie toucheth ſpecially me, who do ſaye and mainteyne that I cited Hilarie truely (as the copie did ſerue) and did trāſlate him truly in Engliſhe after the ſame wordes in latin. This is one Iſſue which I qualifye with a coppie, becauſe I haue Hilarie nowe better correct, which better correction ſitteth forth more liuely the truth thē thother did, &amp; therfore that I did tranſlate was not ſo much to thaduauntage of that I alleged Hilarie for, as is that in the booke that I haue now better correct. Hilaries wordes in the booke newly corrected be theſe. Si enim verè verbum caro factum eſt, et nos verè Verbum

My tranſlation is this. If the worde was made verely fleſhe, &amp; we verely receyue the worde beyng fleſhe in our lordes meate, howe ſhal not Chriſt be thought to dwel naturally in vs, who beyng borne man, hathe taken vnto him the nature of our fleſhe that can not be ſeuered, and hathe put together the nature of his fleſhe to the nature of his eternitie, vnder the Sacrament of the cōmuni
                     •
                   of his fleſhe vnto vs, for ſo we be all one, becauſe the father is in Chriſte, and Chriſte in vs. Wherfore who ſoeuer will deuye the father to be naturally in Chriſt, he muſt 
                     〈◊〉
                   firſt either him ſelfe to be naturally in Chriſt, or Chriſte not to be naturally in him, for the beynge of the father in Chriſt and the beyng of Chriſt in vs, maketh vs to be one in them.

And therfore if Chriſt hath taken verely the fleſhe of our body, and the man that was borne of the virgine Marie is verely Chriſt, and alſo we verely receyue vnder a myſterie the fleſhe of his bodye, by meanes wereof we ſhalbe one, for the father is in Chriſte and Chriſte in vs: howe ſhall that be called the vnitie of will, when the naturall proprietie brought to paſſe by the Sacrement, is the Sacrament of perfite vnitie?
               This tranſlation differeth from myne other, whereat this auctor findeth faulte, but wherein? the worde (Vero) was in the other copie an adiectiue, &amp; I ioyned it with (Myſterio) and therfore ſaid the true myſterie, whiche worde (myſterie) neded no ſuche adiectiue, (true), for euery myſterie is true of it ſelfe. But to ſay as Hilarie truely correct ſaythe, that we receyue vnder the myſterie, truely, the fleſhe of Chriſtes body that word (truely) ſo placed, ſitteth furthe liuely the reall preſence, and ſubſtantiall preſence, of that is receyued, &amp; repeteth againe the ſame that was before ſayd, to the more vehemēcie of it. So as this rorrection is better then my firſt copie, and accordyng to this, correctiō is Hilarius alleged by Melāgton to Decolāpadius, for the ſame purpoſe I allege him. An other alteration in the tranſlation (thou ſciſt reader) in the worde (Perfectae) whiche in my copie was (Perfecta) &amp; ſo was ioyned to (Proprictas,) whiche nowe in the genetiue caſe

ioyned to (Vnitatis) geueth an excellent ſence to the dignitie of the Sacramēt, how the naturall proprietie by the Sacrament, is a Sacrament of perfite vnitre, ſo as the pecfite vnitie of vs with Chriſt, is to haue his fleſhe in vs and to haue Chriſte bodely and naturally dwellyng in vs, by his manhode, as he dwelleth in vs ſpiritually by his god hed, and now I ſpeake in ſuch phraſe as Hilarie and Cyrill ſpeake, and vſe the wordes as they vſe thē.

From that vnitie in Baptiſme he commeth to declare our vnitie with Chriſte in fleſhe, whiche he callethe the Sacrament of perfite vnitie, declarynge howe it is when Chriſte who toke truely our fleſhe mortall, in the virgyns wombe deliuerethe

vs the ſame fleſhe glorified truely to be communicate with our fleſhe, wherby as we be naturally in Chriſt, ſo Chriſt is naturally in vs, and whē this is brought to paſſe, thē is the vnitie betwene Chriſte and vs perfited, for as Chriſt is naturally in the father of the ſame eſſence, by the diuine nature, and God the father naturally in Chriſt his ſonne very God of the ſame eſſence in the diuine nature: So we be naturally in Chriſt by our natural fleſhe, which he toke in the virgyns wombe, and he naturally in vs, by the ſame fleſhe in him glorified, and geuen to vs, and receyued of vs in the Sacrement. For Hilarie ſayth in plaine wordes, howe Chriſtes verye fleſhe, Hilariꝰ. and Chriſtes very bloud receyued and dronken (Accepta &amp; hauſta) bryng this to paſſe. And it is notable, howe Hilarie compareth together the (truely) in Chriſtes takynge of our fleſhe in the virgyns wombe, with the (truely) of our takynge of his fleſhe (In cibo dn̄ico) in our lordes meate, by which words, he expreſſeth the Sacrament, &amp; after reproueth thoſe that ſayd: we were onely vnitie by obedience, and will of religion to Chriſte, and by him ſo to the father, as though, by the Sacrement of fleſhe and bloud, no proprietie of naturall communion were geuen vnto vs, wheras both by the honor geuen vnto vs, we be the ſonnes of god, and by the ſonne dwellynge carnally in vs, and we beynge corporally,

and inſeparably vnitie in him, the myſterie of true and natural vnitie is to be preached. Theſe be Hilaries wordes, for this latter parte, where thou heareſt reader, the ſonne of god to dwel carnally in vs, not after mannes groſſe imagination, for we may not ſo thinke of godly myſteries, but (carnally is referred to the truth of Chriſtes fleſhe, geuē to vs in this Sacramēt, and ſo is (naturally) to be vnderſtanded, that we receyue Chriſtes naturall fleſhe, for the truthe of it, as Chriſte receyued our naturall fleſhe of the virgyn, although we receyue Chriſtes fleſhe glorified incorruptible, verye ſpirituall, and in a ſpiritual maner deliuered vnto vs. Here is mention made of the worde (corporall) but I ſhal ſpeake of that in the diſcuſſiō of Cyril. This hilarie was before ſainct Auguſtine, and was knowen both of him &amp; S. Hierom, who called him (Tuba

Now let vs conſider howe the auctor of this booke forgetteth him ſelfe, to call Chriſte in vs naturally by his godhead, whiche were then to make vs all gods by nature, whiche is ouer greatan abſurditie, and Chriſte in his diuine nature dwelleth onely in his father naturally: and in vs by grace. But as we reaceiue him in the Sacrament of his fleſhe and bloud, if we receyue hym worthely: ſo dwelleth he in vs

naturally, for the mutuall communication of our nature and his. And therfore, where this auctor reaporteth, Hilarie to make no difference betwene our vnyon to Chriſte in Baptiſme, and in the ſupper, let hym truſte, hym no more, that told hym ſo, or if this auctor wil take vpō him (as of his owne knowlege) then, I would ſay (if he were another) an anſwere in frenche, that I will not expreſſe. And here vpō wil I wynne the Iſſue, that in Hilarie, the matter is ſo plaine otherwiſe An iſſue. then this auctour reherſeth, as it hath no colour of defence to the contrarye. And what Hilarie ſpeaketh of Baptiſme, and our vnitie therin. I haue before touched, and this vnitie in fleſhe, is after treated aparte. What ſhall I ſaye to this ſo manifeſt vntruth? but that it confirmeth that I haue in other obſerued, howe therewas neuer one of thē (that I haue red), writynge againſte the Sacramēt: but hath in his writynges, ſayd ſomwhat, ſo euidently in the matter, or out of the matter, diſcrepaunte from truthe, as might be a certaine marke to iudge the qualitie of his ſpirite.
               Thauctor ſaythe, ſuche anſwere as he made to Hilarie, wyll ſerue for Cyrill, and Cyrill. in deade to ſaye truthe it is made after the ſame ſorte, and hathe euen ſuche an error as the other had, ſauyng it maye be excuſed by ignoraunce. For where thauctor trauayleth

For Cyrill telleth hymſelfe plainely, what he meaneth by the worde (corporally) whiche place and this auctour had founde, he might haue ſpared a greate many of wordes vttered by diuination, but then the truthe of that place hindreth and qualeth in maner all the booke.

The ſonne is vnitie as man corporally to vs by the myſtical benedictiō, ſpiritually as God. Theſe be Cyrils wordes, who nameth the Sacrament of the body &amp; bloude of Chriſte the myſticall benediction, and ſheweth in this ſentence, howe hym ſelfe vnderſtādeth the wordes corporally &amp; ſpiritually, That is to ſaye, when Chriſt vniteth hym ſelfe to vs as man, whiche he dothe,

he doth, geuynge his bodye in this Sacrament to ſuche as worthely receyue it, then he dwelleth in them corporally, whiche Chriſte was before in them ſpiritually, orels they could not worthely receyue him to theffecte of that vnitie corporall, and corporall dwellynge, by whiche worde (corporal) is vnderſtanded no groſues at all, whiche the nature of a myſterie excludeth, and yet kepeth truthe ſtill, beyng the vnderſtandyng onely atteined by faythe. But where thauctor of the booke allegeth Cyrill in wordes to deny the eatyng of a man, and to affirme the receyuinge in this Sacrament to be only by faith. It ſhall appeare I doubt not vpon further diſcuſſion, that Cyrill ſay the not ſo, and the tranſlations of Cyrill into latine after the printe of baſil in a booke called (Antidoton) and of hole Cyrils workes prynted at colen, haue not in that place ſuche ſentence. So as folowynge the teſtimonye of thoſe bookes ſet forthe by publique fayth in two ſondrie places. I ſhoulde call thallegation of Cyrill made by this auctour in this poynte vntrue, as it is in deade in the matter vntrue. And yet becauſe the Originall error procedeth from Oecolampadius, it ſhall ſerue to good purpoſe, to directe thoriginall faulte to hym: as he well deſeruethe to be, as he is noted gyltie of it, whoſe reputacion deceyued many in the matter of the

Sacrament, and beynge well noted, howe the ſame Oecolampadius corrupteth Cyrill: it maye percaſe ſomewhat worke with this auctor to conſidre howe he hath in this place been deceyued by him. I will write here, the verye wordes of Cyrill in greke, as they be of Oecolampadius broughte forth and publiſ

faith, whiche was in theſe fathers, Hillarie, and Cyrill, the contencion of theſe thre enuyous wordes, in groſſe capacites groſly taken, naturall, carnall, and corporall, which carnalite hath engēdred, might ſone be much aſſuaged, and this auctor alſo conſideryng with him ſelfe, how muche he hath been ouer ſeen in the vnderſtandyng of them, and the ſpecialtie in this place of him ſelfe, and Deco lampadius, might take occaſion to repēt and call home him ſelfe, who wonderfully wandreth in this matter of the Sacrament, and hauyng loſt his right way, breaketh vp hedges, &amp; leapeth ouer diches, with a wundrous trauaill to go whither he would, not beyng, not yet, (as appeareth,) determined where he would reſt, by the varietie of his owne doctrine, as may appeare in ſoundrie places, if they be compared together.
               As for Baſill, Gregory Niſſen, and Gregoire Baſilius Crego. Niſſenꝰ Grego. Nazian zenus. Naziāzen, this auctor ſaith they ſpeake litle of this matter, in dede they ſpeake not ſomuche as other do, but that they ſpeake, is not diſcrepaunt, nor contrarieth not, that other afore them had writen. For in the olde churche, the truth of this myſtery was neuer impugned openly, and directly, that we rede of, before Berengarius .v. C. yeres paſt, and Berengarius. Bertrame. ſecretely by one Bertrame before that, but onely by the Meſſalions who ſayd the corporal eatyng did neither good nor hurte.

                     •
                  anzene and Niſſene, ſhould take the Sacrament to be figuratiue onely: that is to be denied. And likewiſe it is not true that this auctor teacheth, that of the figure may be ſpoken the ſame thing that may be ſpoke of the thyng it ſelfe: And that I will declare thus. Of the thyng it ſelfe, that is, Chriſtes very body, beyng preſent in dede, it maye be ſayd (adore it) worſhippe it there, which may not be ſayd of the figure. It may be ſayd, of the very thyng beyng preſent there, that it is a highe myracle to be there, it is aboue nature to be there, it is an highe ſecret myſterie to be there. But none of theſe ſpeaches can be conueniētly ſayd of thonly figure, that it is ſuch a miracle, ſo aboue nature, ſo highe a myſterye, to be a figure. And therfore, it is no true doctrine to teache, that we may ſay the ſame of the figure, that may be ſayde of the thyng i
                     •
                   ſelfe. And where this auctor ſpeaketh, of ſpiritual eatyng, and corporall eatyng, he remayneth in his ignoraunce, what the worde corporall meaneth, whiche I haue opened, in diſcuſſyng of his anſwer to Cyrill, fayth is required in him that ſhall eate ſpiritually, and the corporall eatyng inſtitute in Chriſtes

ſupper, requireth by the reuerēr of mans mouth, to receyue our Lordes meat &amp; drinke, his owne verye fleſh and bloud, by his omnipotencie prepated in that ſupper, whiche not ſpiritually, that is to ſay, innocently (as S. Augu. In Ioā. tract. xxvj. Auguſtine in one place expoundeth ſpiritually) receyued, bryngeth iudgement and condempnacion, accordyng to Saincte Paules wordes.
               This auctor ſayth that Emiſſen is ſhortly Emiſse anſwered vnto, and ſo is he (if a man care not what he ſaith) as Hilarie was anſwered and Cyrill. But els, there can not ſhorte or longe anſwere confounde the true playne teſtymonye of Emiſſen, for the commen true fayth of the church in the Sacramēt. Which Emiſſen hath this ſentence. That the inuiſible Prieaſt, (by the ſecrete powre with his worde) turneth the viſible creatures into the ſubſtaunce of his bodye and bloud, ſaiynge thus: This is my body: And agayne, repetyng the ſame ſāctificatiō, this is my bloud. Wherfore, as at the becke of him, commaundynge the heightes of heuens, the depenes of the flouds, and largenes of landes, were founded of nothyng, by like powre in ſpirituall Sacramentes, where vertue commandeth, theffect of the truth ſerueth. Theſe be Emiſſenes ſaiynges, declaryng his fayth plainely of the Sacrament, in ſuche termes, as can not be wreſted, nor writhed, who ſpeaketh of a turnyng &amp; couuerſion of the viſible

creatures, into the ſubſtaunce of Chriſtes body and bloud, he ſayth not into the Sacrament of Chriſtes body and bloud, nor figure of Chriſtes body &amp; bloud, wherby he ſhould meane a onely ſacramentall conuerſion, as this auctor would haue it, but he ſayth, into the ſubſtaunce of Chriſtes body and bloud, declaryng the truth of Chriſtes body &amp; bloud to be in the Sacrament. For the wordes (ſubſtaunce) and (truth) be of one ſtrenght, and ſhewe a difference from a figure, wherin the truth is not in dede preſent, but ſignified to be abſent. And becauſe it is a worke ſupernaturall, and a great miracle. This Emiſſen repreſſeth mannes carnall reaſon, and ſuccurreth the weke fayth, with remembraunce of like power of God in the creation of the worlde, whiche were brought forth out of tyme by Emiſſen, if Chriſtes body were not in ſubſtaunce preſent, as Emiſſens wordes be, but in figure only as this auctor teacheth. And where this auctor coupleth together the two Sacramentes, of Baptiſme, and of the body and bloud of Chriſt, as though there were no difference in the preſence of Chriſt in either, he putteth him ſelfe in daunger, to be reproued of malice, or ignoraunce. For although theſe myſteryes be both great, and mans regeneracion in baptiſme is alſo a myſterye and the ſecrete worke of God, &amp; hath a great maruayle in that effecte: yet it diffreth from the myſterye, of the Sacrament, touchyng

the maner of Chriſtes preſēce and the workyng of theffecte alſo. For in Baptiſme our vnion with Chriſte is wrought without the real preſence of Chriſtes humanitie, only in the vertue and effect of Chriſtes bloud the whole trinitie there workynge, as auctor, in whoſe name the Sacramēt is expreſſely miniſtred, where our ſoule is regenerate &amp; made ſpiritual, but not our body in dede, but in hope onely that for the ſpirite of Chriſt dwellyng in vs, our mortall bodyes ſhalbe reſuſcitate, and as we haue in Baptiſme be buried with Chriſt: ſo we be aſſured, to be parte takers of his reſurrectiō. And ſo in this Sacramēt we be vnite to Chriſts māhode by this diuinite. But in the Sacrament of Chriſtes body and bloude, we be in nature vnited to Chriſte as man: and by his glorified fleſhe, made parte takers alſo of his diuinite, whiche myſticall vniō repreſenteth vnto vs the high eſtate of our glorificatiō, wherin body &amp; ſowle ſhall in the generall reſurrectiō, by a meruaylous regeneratiō of the body, be made both ſpiritual, the ſpeciall pledge whereof, we receyue in this Sacramēt, &amp; therfore it is the ſacramēt (as hilarie ſaith) of perfect vnitie. And albeit the ſoule of man be more precious, thē the bodye, &amp; the nature of the godhead in Chriſte, more excellent thē the nature of man in hym glorified, &amp; in Baptiſme, ma
                     •
                  nes ſoule is regenerate in the vertue and effect of Chriſtes paſſiō &amp; bloud, chriſtes godhead preſēt there

without the reall preſence of his humanitie: although for theſe reſpects thexellēce of Baptiſme is great: Yet becauſe the miſtery of the Sacrament of thaltare, where Chriſt is preſēt, both man &amp; god, in theffectual vnite, that is wrought bitwene oure bodyes, our ſoules &amp; Chriſtes, in the vſe of this Sacremēt ſignifieth the perfect redēption of oure bodyes in the general reſurrectiō, which ſhalbe thende &amp; cōſūmation of al oure felicitie. This Sacrament of perfite vnitie, is the myſterye of our perfite aſtate, when body &amp; ſoule ſhalbe all ſpiritual, &amp; hath ſo a degre of exellēce, for the dignitie that is eſtemed in euerie ende &amp; perfection, wherfore the worde (ſpirituall) is a neceſſarie worde, in this Sacramēt, to call it a ſpirituall foode, as it is in dede for it is to work in our bodies a ſpiritual effect, not only in oure ſoules, &amp; Chriſtes body &amp; fleſhe, &amp; yet a true body &amp; very fleſhe. And it is preſent in this ſacramēt after a ſpiritual maner, graunted &amp; taught of all true teachers, whiche we ſhould receiue alſo ſpiritually, whiche is by hauyng Chriſt before ſpiritually in vs to receiue it ſo worthely. Wherfore, lyke as in the inuiſible ſubſtance of the Sacramēt, there is nothyng carnal but al ſpirituall, takyng the word carnal, as it ſignifieth groſſely in mās carnal iudgemēt: So where the receyuers of that foode bryng carnal luſtes or deſirs, carnall fanſies or imaginatiōs with them, they receyue the ſame precious foode vnworthely

to their iudgement and condempnation. For they iudge not truely, after the ſimplicitie of a true Chriſten fayth, of the very preſence of Chriſtes bodye. And this ſuffiſeth to wype out, that this auctor hath ſpoken of Emiſſene againſte the truthe.
               As touchyng S. Ambroſe, this auctor taketh a great entrepriſe to wreſtel with him, whoſe plaine &amp; euident wordes muſt nedes be a rule to trie his othere wordes by, if any might be writhed. What cā be more plainly ſpoken, then S. Ambroſe ſpeketh, when he ſayth theſe words. It is bread before the cō
                  ſecration but after it is the bodye of Chriſte. By the worde conſecration, is ſignified (as it is here placed) gods omnipotēt worke. wherfore, in this place it cōprehendeth aſmuch as Emiſſen ſaid in theſe wordes (he conuerteth by the ſecrete powre of his word) God is the worker, &amp; ſo conſecratiō ſignifith, the whole action of his omnipotencie, in workynge the ſubſtaunce of this high myſterie, and therfore the definition of the worde conſecratiō, as it is generally taken, cannot be a rule to thunderſtandyng of it, in this high myſterie, wher it is vſed to expreſſe a ſinguler worke, as the circumſtaunce of S. Ambroſe writyng doth declare. For as philip Melāctō writeth Melancton. to Oecolāpadius, S. Ambroſe would neuer haue trauailed, to accumulate ſo many miracles as he doth, ſpeaking of this matter to declare gods omnipotēcie &amp; he had not thought

the nature of bread to be chaunged in this myſterie. Theſe be melanctons very wordes. Nowe to anſwer the queſtiō, (as it were at the worde chaunge), this auctor ſhall come with a ſacramēral change whiche is a diuiſe in termes to blind the rude reader. S. Ambroſe doth expreſſe plainly what the change is, whē he writeth the wordes before reherſed.
               It is bread before the conſecration, but after it is the body of chriſt, Cā a change be more plainly declared? The nerer way for this auctor had ben to haue ioyned Ambroſe with Clemēt, &amp; called him fained by the Papiſtes, rather then after theffect of conſecration ſo opened by ſainct Ambroſe himſelfe, to trauayll to proue what it maye ſignifie, if it were in an other matter. And then to admoniſhe the reader, howe the bread and wyne haue no holines, whiche forme of ſpeach, not vnderſtanded of the people engendreth ſome ſcruple that nedeth not, being no ſoūde fourme of doctrine, for S. Paule ſpeaketh &amp; teacheth 1. Ti. 4. thus, that the creatures be ſāctified by the worde of God &amp; prayour. And S. Auguſtine Augu. de peccatis morta. et remiſſ. libro. 2. Cap. 26. Cyprian de cena domini. writeth of ſāctified bread to be geuen to them that be catechiſed before they be baptized. And this auctor himſelfe expoundeth S. Cyprian in the. 
                     •
                  5. leef of his booke howe the diuinitie is poured in to the bread Sacramē
                  tally, whiche is a ſtrange phraſe not expreſſynge there Cyprians mynde, and farre diſcrepaunt

from the doctrine here.
               And in an other place this auctor ſayth, Fo. 85. Pagi. 2. that as hotte &amp; burnyng yron, is yron ſtill, &amp; yet hath the force of fier: ſo the bread &amp; wyne be turned in to the vertue of Chriſtes fleſhe and bloud. By whiche ſimilitude bread may conceyue vertue, as yron couceyueth fyere, &amp; thē as we call yron burnyng, &amp; fireye, ſo we may call bread vertuous and holy, onies the auctor woulde againe reſemble bread to a whetſtone that may make ſharpe &amp; haue no ſharpenes in it at al. Which matter I declare thus to ſhewe that as this auctor diſſenteth from truth in other, ſo he diſſēteth from that he vttereth for truth him ſelfe, &amp; walketh in a maze, impugnynge the verye truth in this Sacramēt, &amp; would haue that takē for a Catholique doctrine that is not one, &amp; the ſame doctrine through his hole booke, ſo far of is it from the hole of Chriſten teachynge, But nowe let vs conſidre what ſpeaches of. S. Ambroſe this auctor bryngeth furth, wherewith to altre the truth of the very plain propre ſpeache of S. Ambroſe ſaiyng: it is bread before the conſecration, but after, it is the body of Chriſt.
               Sainct Ambroſe as this auctor ſayth in an other place ſayth thus. Before the bene dictiō of the heuēly wordes, it is called another kynde of thyng, but after the conſecration, is ſignified the body &amp; bloud of Chriſt. And another ſpeache thus. Before the conſecration,

it is called an other thyng, but after the cōſecration it is named the bloud of Chriſt, &amp; yet a third ſpeach where the word (cal) is vſed before and after both, as thou reader mayſt ſe in this auctors booke in the. 82 leef. Nowe good reader was thereeuer man ſo ouerſeen as this auctor is who ſeeth not. S. Ambroſe in theſe thre latter ſpeaches to ſpeake as plainly as in the firſt. For in the laſt ſpeache S. ambroſe ſaith it is called bread before the Cōſecratiō, &amp; called the body of Chriſt after the cōſecration. And I wolde Demaunde of this auctor, doth not this word (call) ſignifie the truth that is bread in dede before the conſecration? whiche if it be ſo why ſhall not the ſame worde (call) ſignifie alſo the very truth added to the wordes of the bodye of Chriſte after the cōſecratiō? &amp; likewiſe whē he ſaith, ſpeakyng of the bodye of Chriſte the worde (ſignified) or (named) whiche is aſmuche as (call) Thee body of Chriſt is ſignified there, for Chriſt ſayd, This is my bodye &amp;c. vſyng the outwarde ſignes of the viſible creatures to ſignifie the body &amp; bloud preſent, &amp; not abſēt. Was not Chriſt the true ſōne of God, becauſe thangel ſayd he ſhal be called the ſōne of God. But in theſe places of S. Ambroſe Luc. 2. to expreſſe plainly what he ment by (calling) he putteth that worde (Call) to the bread, before the conſecratiō, aſwell as to the body of Chriſt after the cōſecratiō, therby to declare howe in his vnderſtādyng this worde (Call)
                  
ſignifieth aſmuch truth in the thyng where vnto it is added after conſecratiō as before, and therfore as it is by ſainct Ambroſe called bread before conſecration, ſignifiyng it was ſo in dede, ſo it is called, ſignified or named (whiche thre thus plated be all one in effect) the body of Chriſt after the conſecration and is ſo in dede, agreable to the plaine ſpeache of ſainct Ambroſe, where he ſayth: It is bread before the conſecration, and it is the body of Chriſt after the cōſecration. As touchyng the ſpiritualtie of the meat of Chriſtes bodye, I haue ſpoken before, but where this auctor addeth it requireth no corporall preſence, he ſpeaketh in his dreame beynge oppreſſed with ſlepe of ignoraunce and can not tell what (corporall) meaneth as I haue opened before by thauctorite of Cyrill. Nowe let vs ſe what this auctor ſayth to Chriſoſtome.
               This auctor noteth in Chriſoſtome Chriſoſtome. two places, and bryngeth them forth, and in handlyng the firſt place, declareth himſelfe to trifle in ſo great a matter, euidently to his owne reproufe. For where in the ſecōd booke of his worke, entretyng tranſubſtanciation, he would the ſame words of Chriſoſtome by this fourme of ſpeache in the negatiue ſhould not denye preciſely. And when Chriſoſtome ſayth, do not thinke that you by man receiue the body of god, but that we ſhould not conſidre man in the receiuyng of it. Here this

auctor doth allege thoſe wordes and reaſoneth of them as though they were termes of were deny all. But I would aſke of this auctor this queſtion. If Chriſoſtomes fayth had been, that we receyue not the bodye of God in the Sacramēt verely: Why ſhould he vſe wordes Idelly to entreat of whome we receiued the body of God, whiche after this auctors doctrine we receiue not at all but in figure? &amp; no body at all whiche is of Chriſtes humanitie beyng Chriſt, as this auctor teacheth ſpiritually, that is, by his diuine nature in him onely that worthely receyueth, and in the verye Sacrament as he concludeth in his booke onely figuratiuely. Turne backe reader to the. 36. l
                     •
                  ef in the auctors booke and reade it with this, and ſo conſidre vpon what principle here is made an (Ergo). I will anſwere that place, whan I ſpeake of tranſubſtanciation, whiche ſhall be after anſwer to the third and fourth booke as the naturall ordre of the matter requiteth.
               The ſecond place of Chriſoſtome that this auctor bringeth furth he graūteth it ſoūdeth much againſt him, &amp; fauoreth his aduerſaries but with cōferryng &amp; cōſideryng, he truſteth to altre it from the true vnderſtandyng. And not to expound, but confoūde the matter, he ioyneth in ſpeach the Sacramēt of baptiſme with this ſacramēt (which ſhifte this auctor vſed vntruly in Hilarie) &amp; would now beare in hand that the preſēce of Chriſt were none

otherwiſe in this ſacramēt thē in Baptiſme, (whiche is not ſo) for in this Sacrament, Chriſtes humanitie &amp; godhead is really preſēt, &amp; in Baptiſme his godhead with the effectuall vertue of his bloud, in whiche we be waſſhed, not requiring by ſcripture any real preſēce for diſpēſation of that myſtery, as I haue before touched diſcuſſyng thanſwer of Emiſſen, where as Chriſoſtome ſpeakyng of Chriſoſto. de Sacerdo. li. 3. this ſacramēt whereof I haue before ſpokē, and Melancton allegyng it to Oecolampadius ſaith thus: The great myracle and great beneuolence of Chriſt is, that he ſitteth aboue with his father, and is the ſame houre in our handes here to de embraſed of vs. and therfore where this auctor would not the wōdre of gods worke in the Sacrament to be wonderfull for the worke and effect in man, this is one piece of truth, but in the Sacrament of the body and bloud of Chriſt, the olde fathers wonder at the worke in the Sacramēt, how bread is chaūged into the body of chriſt, how Chriſt ſittyng in heauen God and man, is alſo man and God in the Sacrament, and beyng worthly receiued dwelleth in ſuch carnally and naturally as Hilarie ſayth, and corporally as Cyrill ſayth. How this can be, no man can tell, no faythfull mā ſhould aſke, and yet it is the true Catholique fayth, to be truely ſo wrought. For as Emiſſene ſayth: he that is thauctor of it, he is the witneſſe of it. And therfore I wil make it an iſſue with this An iſſue.

So this auctor hath nowe in this worke confeſſed the trāſlacion of the catechiſme, which one in cōmunication would nedes haue made me beleue, had been his mannes doyng and not his. Heare now reader, how plainly Theophilact ſpeaketh vpon the Goſpel
                     •
                   of Sainct Iohn, expounding the .vi. Chapter.
               Take hede that the bread whiche is eaten of vs in the myſteryes is not onely a certaine figuration of the fleſhe of our Lorde, but the fleſhe it ſelfe of our Lorde, for he ſayde not, The bread whiche I ſhall geue is the figure of my fleſh, but it is my fleſhe. For that bread by the myſticall benediction, is tranſformed by myſtical wordes and preſence of the holy ghoſt into the fleſh of our Lord. And it ſhould trouble no mā, that the bread is to be beleued fleſhe, for whiles our Lorde walked in fleſh, and receiued nurriſhmēt of bread, that bread he did eat was chaunged into his body, and was made like to his holy fleſhe, and as it is cuſtomably in mans feadyng ſerued to the ſuſtentacion and encreaſe of it, therfore the bread now alſo is chaunged into the fleſhe of our Lorde. And howe is it then that it appeareth not fleſhe but bread? that we ſhould not loth the eatyng of it, for if fleſhe did appeare, we ſhould be vnpleſauntly diſpoſed to the communion of it. Nowe our Lorde cōdeſcēdyng to our infirmitie, the myſtical meat, appeareth ſuche to vs, as thoſe we haue been accuſtomed vnto. Hitherto I haue faithfully

expreſſed Thiophilactes wordes, out of Latyn of 
                     •
                  ecolampadins tranſlation, without termyng the ſubſtanciall poyntes, otherwiſe thē the wordes purporte in Latyn: By which may appeare what was Theophilacts meanyng, what doctrine he geueth of the Sacrament, and howe his owne wordes vpon S. Marke, be to be vnderſtanded, whē he ſayth. Speciem quidem panis &amp; vini ſeruat, in virtutem 
                  Theophilact. 
                  autem carnis &amp; ſanguinis tranſelemētat, in corruptyng of whiche wordes (this auctor maketh) a great matter, when they were not alleged for his, but as they be his (ſeruare ſpeciem) maye be well tranſlate (fourme and apparaunce) becauſe vpon Sainct Iohn before alleged, he ſayth of the bread, (it appeareth.) And as for theſe wordes (the vertue of Chriſtes fleſhe and bloud) muſt be vnderſtā
                  ded to agre with the playne place of Theophilacte vpon Sainct Iohn, and vpō marke alſo, to ſignifie not only vertue, but veritie of the fleſhe and bloud of Chriſt. For if Theophilacte by that ſpeache mente the vertue of the body of Chriſt, and not the veritie of the very body, (as this author ſayth he did) why ſhoulde Theophilacte, bothe vpon Saincte Marke, and alſo vpon Saincte Iohn, aſke this queſtion, why doth not the fleſhe appeare? if himſelfe by thoſe wordes ſhould teache there were onely 
                     〈◊〉
                   preſente the vertue of his fleſhe, who, and he had ment ſo, would not haue aſked the queſtion, or if he had, would

haue anſwerd it thus: Accordyngly (there is no fleſhe in dede) but the vertue of the fleſhe, and that had been a playne anſwer and ſuch as he would haue made. This auctor wylaſke then, why doth Theophilacte vſe this phraſe to ſay, chaunged into the vertue of the bodye of Chriſt. Here vnto I anſwere, that this worde vertue in phraſe of ſpeache manny tymes, onely filleth the ſpeache, and is comprehended in the ſignification of his genitiue folowyng, and therfore as Luke in the .xxij. Chapter ſayth: (à dextris virtutis Dei,) ſo in the Actes the ſame ſentence is ſpoken (a dextris Dei) both out of one penne, and (a dextris virtutis Dei) is no more to ſay then (à dextris Dei) and ſo is (virtutem carnis &amp; ſanguinis) no more to ſay, but (in carnem &amp; ſanguinem) whiche ſentence the ſame Theophilacte hath vpon Sainct Iohn before alleged, in this ſayng: The bread is chaunged in 
                     •
                  ofieſh, and in marke in this phraſe, in to the vertue of fleſh, beyng: Like theſe ſpeaches, (à dextris Dei) &amp; (à dextris virtutis Dei.) Whiche and it had liked this auctor to haue conſidered: he ſhould haue taken Theophilactes ſpeache as Theophilacte vnderſtandeth himſelfe, and ſayde the wordes alleged in the name of Theophilus Alexandrinus, were not Theophilactes wordes, and then he had ſayd for ſo muche true (whiche would do well among) and the wordes be not in dede Theophilactes words,

nor were not alleged for his. Nowe when this author ſayth: they were not Theophilus Alexandrinus wordes, that is a large negatiue, and wilbe hardely proued otherwiſe then by addition of the auctors knowlege, for any thyng that he can fynde, and ſo there ſhalbe no abſurdite to graūte it. And thus I retourne to myne Iſſue with this auctor, that Theophilacte himſelfe hathe no ſuche meanynge expreſſed in wordes as this auctour attributeth vnto him, but an euident contrarye meanynge, ſauyng herein I will agree with this auctour, that Theophilacte mente not groſſely, ſenſibly, and carnally, as theſe wordes ſounde in carnarall mennes iudgementes. For we maye not ſo thinke of Gods myſteryes, the worke wherof is not carnall, nor corporall, for the maner of it. But the maner ſpirituall, and yet in the Sacrament of the body and bloud of Chriſt, becauſe Chriſt is in his very true fleſhe preſent, he maye be ſayde ſo carnally preſent, and naturally, after Hylary, and corporally after Cyrill, vnderſtandyng the wordes of the truthe of that is preſent, Chriſtes verye body and fleſhe, and not of the maner of the preſence, whiche is onely ſpirituall, ſupernaturall, and aboue mannes cappacitie. And therfore a highe myſterye, a greate myracle, a wonderfull worke: whiche it is holſome to beleue ſimplye with a ſyncere fayth,

and daungerous to ſerche and examyne with a curious imaginacion, ſuche as idelines and arrogaunce would tempte a man vnto, and by diuiſyng of a figure, or metaphore, bryng it within the compaſſe of our buyſie reaſon.
               This auctor, trauayleth to anſwer Saint Hierom. Hierome, and to make him the eaſyer for him to deale with, he cutteth of that foloweth in the ſame Saincte Hierome, whiche ſhould make the matter open and manifeſt: howe effectually Sainct Hierome ſpeaketh of the Sacramēt of Chriſtes body and bloud. Ther is (ſayth Sainct Hierome) as great differēce betwene the loues called (Panes ꝓpoſitiones) and the body of Chriſt, as there is betwene the ſhadowe of a body, and the body it ſelfe, and as there is betwene an image and the true thyng it ſelfe, and betwene an example of thynges to come, and the thynges that be prefigured by them. Therfore as mekenes, pacience, ſobrietie, moderation, abſtinence of gayne, hoſpitalitie alſo, and liberalite ſhould be chiefly in a Byſhop, and among all laye men an excellencie in them: ſo their ſhould be in him a ſpecial chaſtite, and as I ſhould ſay, chaſtitie that is prieſtly, that he ſhoulde not onely abſteyne from an vncleane worke, but alſo from the caſte of his eye, and his mynde fre from error of thought, that ſhould make the body of Chriſt. Theſe be Sainct Hierōs words in this place. By the latter part wherof, appeareth playnely how Sainct Hierom

meaneth of Chriſtes body in the Sacramēt, of whiche the loues that were (Panes propoſitiones) were a ſhadow, (as Sainct Hierom ſayth) that bread beyng the image, and this the trueth, that the example, and this that was prefigured. So as if Chriſtes body in the Sacrament ſhould be there but figuratiuely (as this auctor teacheth) then were the bread of propoſition, figure of a figure, and ſhadowe of a ſhadowe, whiche is ouer great an abſurdite in our religion. Therfore there cannot be a more playne proufe to ſhewe, that (by Saincte Hieroms mynde,) Chriſtes body is verely in the Sacrament, &amp; not figuratiuely onely, then when he noteth, (Panes propoſitiones) to be the figure &amp; the ſhadowe of chriſtes body in the Sacrament. For as, Tertulliā ſayth, (Figura non eſſet, niſi veritatis 
                  Tertullianꝰ aduerſus Marcio. libr. 4. 
                  eſſet corpus.) The other were not to be called a figure (if that, that anſwered vnto it,) were not of truth, whiche is the ſence of Tertullians wordes. And therfore Saincte Hierome could with no other wordes haue expreſſed his mynde ſo certainely and playnly, as with theſe, to confeſſe the truth of Chriſts body in the Sacramēt. And therfore, regarde not reader, what this auctor ſayth: For S. Hierom affirmeth playnely Chriſtes true body to be in the Sacrament, the conſecration wherof although Saincte Hierome attributeth to the miniſtre: Yet we muſt vnderſtand him, that he taketh God, for the auctor and

worker, not withſtandyng by reaſon of the miniſtery
                     •
                   in the church, the doyng is aſcribed to man, as miniſtre, becauſe Chriſt ſayde (Hoc facite) after whiche ſpeache, ſaluation, remiſſion of ſynne, and the worke in other Sacramentes, is attribute to the miniſtre, beyng neuertheles the ſame, the propre, and ſpeciall workes of God. And this I adde, becauſe ſome he vninſtely offended, to hiere that man ſhoulde make the bodye of Chriſt, and this auctor findeth faulte before at the worde makyng, whiche religiouſly hearde, and reuerently ſpoken, ſhoulde offende no man, for man is but a miniſtre, wherein he ſhoulde not glory, and Chriſt maketh not himſelfe of the mattier of bread, nor maketh himſelfe ſo ofte of bread a newe body: but ſittyng in heauen, dothe as our inuiſible Prieſt worke in the miniſterye of the viſible Prieſthode of his churche, and maketh preſent (by his omnipotencye) his glorified body and bloud in this high miſtery, by conuerſion of the viſible treatures of bread and wyne, (as Emiſſene ſayth,) into the ſame. This auctor of this booke (as thou reader maiſt perceiue) applyeth the figure of the breades called (Panes propoſitiones) to the body of Chriſt to cōme, where as Saincte Hierome calleth them the figure of Chriſtes body in the Sacrament, and therfore dothe fation his argumente in this ſence. If thoſe breades that were but a

figure, required ſo muche clenneſſe in them that ſhoulde eate them, that they might not eate of them, whiche a daye or two before, had lien with there wyues: what clenneſſe is required in him that ſhoulde make the bodye of Chriſt? Wherby thou maiſt ſee here this auctor hath reſerued this notable place of Saincte Hierome, to the latter ende, that thou ſhouldeſt in the ende aſwell as in the middes ſee him euidētly ſnarled, for thy better remembrance.
               Becauſe this auctor, who hitherto hathe anſwered none ſubſtanciallye, woulde neuertheles be ſeen to anſwere all, he wyndeth vp ſixe of then in one fardel, Saincte Auguſtine, Auguſti. Seduliꝰ Leo. Fulgētiꝰ Caſſiodorus. Gregor. Sedulius, Leo, Fulgentius, Caſſiodorus, and Gregorius, and diſpatcheth them all with an (vt ſupra) and among them, I thynke he woulde haue knytte vp all the reſt of the lerned men of all ages, amonges whome, I knowe none that write (as this auctor do the) of the Sacrament, or impugneth the Catholique fayth, as this author doth, by the enuyouſe name of Papiſtes. Senes Chriſtes tyme, there is no memorye, more then of ſixe, that hathe affirmed that doctrine, whiche this auctour woulde haue called nowe the Catholique doctrine, and yet not writen by them of one ſorte, neyther receyued in belyefe in publique profeſſion. But ſecretely, when it happened, begun

by conſpiration, and in the ende euer hitherto extincte and quenched. Firſt was Bertrame, Thē Berēgarius, Thē Wychefe, and in our tyme Decolēpadius, Swinglius, and Ioa

               Laſt of al, thauctor abuſeth himſelfe with Damaſcene, and goth about to anſwere him Damaſcen. by makyng of a ſumme, whiche ſumme, is ſo wrong accompted, that euery man that readeth Damaſcene, may be auditour to cōtrole it. And this will I ſaye, Damaſcene writeth ſo euidently in the matter that Peter Martyr for a ſhifte, is fayne to fynde faulte in his iudgemēt and age, and yet he is. vi

And what ſo euer his iudgemente were, he writeth as Melancton ſayth, his teſtimonye of the fayth of the Sacrament as it was in his tyme. I would wryte in here Damaſcens wordes, to compare them with the ſame, collected by this auctor, wherby to diſproue his particulars playnely, but the wordes of Damaſcen

be to be red, trāſlate alreadie abrode. As for the foure ſubſtaunces, whiche this auctor by accompte numbreth of Chriſt, might haue bene left vnrekened by tale, becauſe among them that be faithfull, and vnderſtand truely, wherſoeuer the ſubſtance of Chriſtes very body is, there is alſo vnderſtanded by concomitaunce to be preſente the ſubſtaunce of his ſoule as very man, and alſo of the godhed as very God. And in the matter of the Sacrament, therfore contendyng with him that would haue the ſubſtāce of bread there, it maye be ſayd there is in the Sacrament the onely, ſubſtance of Chriſtes bodye, becauſe the worde onely thus placed, excludeth other ſtraunge ſubſtaunces, and not the ſubſtaunces, whiche without contencion be knowen and cōfeſſed, vnite with Chriſtes body. And ſo a mā may be ſaid, to be alone in his houſe, when he hath no ſtraungers, although he hath a numbre of his owne men, and Eraſmus noteth howe the euangeliſte writeth Chriſt to haue prayed alone, &amp; yet certayne of his diſciples were there. And if in a contenciō rayſed, whether the father and ſonne were both kylled in ſuche a felde or no, I defended the father to haue been onely kylled there, and thervpon a wager layd, ſhould I loſe, if by proufe it appeared, that not onely the father, but alſo thre or foure of the fathers ſeruantes were ſlayue, but the ſonne eſcaped? And as in this ſpeache the worde

(onely) ſerued to exclude that was in contencion, and not to reduce the numbre to one, nomore is it in the ſpeache that this auctour woulde reproue, and therfore neded not to haue occupied himſelfe in the matter, wherin I hearde him ones ſaye in a good audience himſelfe was ſatiſfied.

               ¶The confutation of the fourth booke.
               
                  THus hauynge pervſed the effecte of the thyrde booke, I will likewiſe peruſe the fourth, and then ſhall folowe in directe courſe to ſpeake of the matter of tranſubſtāciaciō. In this fourth boke thauctor entreteth eatyng and drinkyng of Chriſtes body and bloud, and in the firſt parte therof trauaileth to conferme his purpoſe, and in the ſeconde parte anſwereth as he can to his aduerſaries, and ſo taketh occaſion, to ſpeake of adoration. His chefe purpoſe is to proue that euel men receyue not the bodye and bloud of Chriſt in the Sacrament, whiche afte
                     •
                   this auctours doctrine, is a very ſuperfluous matter. For if the ſacramēt be onely a figure, and the bodye and bloud of Chriſt be there onely figuratiuely, wherto ſhould this auctor diſpute of euell mennes eatyng, whē good men cannot eate Chriſt in the ſacrament becauſe he is not there. For by the effecte of this auctours doctrine, the Sacrament is but a viſible preachyng, by the tokens and ſignes of bread and wyne, that in beleuyng and remē

                     te. iibr. 3. beyng that called of S. Auguſtine the inuiſible ſacrament, wherin by fayth we be nurriſhed with the worde of God, and the vertue of Chriſtes body and bloud, whiche, the true teachyng of the church calleth ſpiritual manducation onely, without which, no man is to be accompted a true membre of the myſticall bodye of Chriſt. And therfore who ſo feadeth vpon Chriſt thus ſpiritually, muſt nedes be a good man, for onely good men be 
                     •
                  rewe membres of Chriſtes myſticall bodye, whiche ſpirituall eatynge is ſo good a frute, as it declareth the tree neceſſariely to be God, and therfore it muſt be and is a certayne concluſion that onely good men do eat and drinke the body &amp; bloud of Chriſt ſpiritually, that is to ſay, effectually to life. So as this auctor ſhall haue of me no aduerſarie therein. And if this auctour had prouued

that to be the true doctrine, that Chriſtes very body and bloud, is not preſent in the viſible Sacrament, then myght he haue left this fourth booke vnwryten. For after his doctrine, as I ſayd before, good men do not eate Chriſtes bodye in the Sacrament vnder the viſible ſignes, for becauſe it is not there, and then much leſſe ſhould euel men reache it. In the Catholique teachyng, all the doctrine of eatyng of Chriſt, is concluded in two maner of eatynges, one in the viſible Sacrament Sacramentall, another ſpirituall without the Sacrament, And becauſe in the eatynge of the viſible Sacrament Sainct Paule ſpeaketh of vnworthy, the ſame true teachynge to open the matter more clerely accordyng to Scripture noteth vnto vs thre maner of eatynges, one ſpirituall onely, whiche onely good men do feadyng in fayth without the viſible Sacrament. Another is bothe ſpirituall and Sacramentall, whiche alſo good men onely do, receiuyng the viſible Sacrament, with a true ſincere charitable fayth.
               The third maner of eatyng, is Sacramentall onely, whiche after ſainct Paule euel men do vnworthely, and therfore haue iudgement and condempnation, and be gylty of our lordes bodye not eſtemynge our lordes bodye there. And here arriſteth the knot of contētion with this auctor, who ſayeth euel men eate but the Sacramental bread, whervnto I replie, no more do good men neyther,

if this auctors doctrine of the Sacrament be trewe, ſeyng he will haue it but a figure. If this auctor wil ſay theffecte is other in good men, then in euell men, I will not ſtryue therin. But to diſcuſſe this matter euidently, we muſt righely open the truth and then muſt conſidre, the viſible Sacramentes as they be of gods ordinaunce, who directeth vs where to ſeke for his giftes, and howe, whoſe workyng albeit it be not reſtrayned by his Sacramentes, and therfore God maye and dothe inuiſibly ſanctifie and ſalue as it pleaſith him. yet he teacheth vs of his ordinarye workyng in the viſible Sacramentes, and ordereth vs to ſeke his giftes of helthe and life there, wherupon ſainct Auguſtin noteth howe Baptiſme among the Augu. de peccatis meri. et remiſſ. libro. 4. Cap. 
                        •
                     4 Chriſten men of Aphrike was verye well called helth, and the Sacrament of Chriſtes body called lyfe, as in whiche God geueth helthe and lefe, if we worthely vſe them. Thordinance of theſe ſacraments is goddes worke, the verye author of them, who as he is himſelfe vniforme, as ſainct Iames Iacob. 1. ſayth without alteration, ſo as Dauid ſayth, his workes be true, whiche is aſmuch as vniforme, for truth and vniforme anſwerith together. As God is all goodnes, ſo all his workes be good. So as conſideryng the ſubſtaunce of goddes workes and ordinauces as they be themſelfe, they be always vniforme, certain and true, in ther ſubſtāce,

as God ordred them Among men for whom they be wrought and ordred ther is variete, good men, euell men, worthy, vnworthy, but as ſainct Paule ſayeth there is but one Ephe. 4 lorde, one fayth, one Baptiſme. And the parable of the ſower whiche Chriſte declared Mat. 5. himſelfe ſheweth a dyuerſite of the groundes where the ſeed dyd fall, but the ſede was all one, that dyd fall in the good grownde, and that did fal in the noughty grownde, but yt fructified onely in the good grownde, whiche ſeede Chriſte calleth his worde. And in the ſixt of ſainct Iohn ſayeth Ioan. 6. his worde is ſpirite and lyfe, ſo as by the teachyng of Chriſt, ſpirite and lyfe maye fal vpon noughty men, although for theire malice, it carieth not nor fructifieth not in them. And ſainct Auguſtine accordyng hereunto, In Ioā. tract. 27 noteth howe Chriſtes wordes be ſpirite and life, although thou doſt carnally vnderſtand them, and haſt no frute of them, yet ſo they be ſpirite and life, but not to the, wherby appeareth the ſubſtaunce of gods ordynaunce to be one, though we, in the vſyng of it vary. The promyſes of God can not be diſapointed by mannes infidelite as S. Paule ſaith, which place Luther allegeth Rom. 3. to ſhewe the vnitie in the ſubſtāce of Baptiſme, whither it be miniſtred to good or euell. But S. Paule to the Corinthiās declareth it 2. Cor. 2 notably in theſe wordes. We be the good ſauor of Chriſt in thē that be ſalued, &amp; them

that periſhe. Here S. Paule noteth the ſauor good, and one to diuerſe men: but after the diuerſite in men, of diuerſe effectes in them that is to ſaye, the ſauor of life, and the ſauor of deathe, whiche ſayng of S. Paule the greke ſcolies gathered by (Occumenius) open and declare with ſimilitudes in nature very aptely. The dowe (they ſay) and the betel, ſhall feade both vpon one oyntemē
                  
                     •
                  , and the betel dye of it, and the done ſtrenghthened by it. The diuerſite in theffecte, folouing of the diuerſite of them that eate, and not of that is 
                     •
                  aten, whiche is alway one. Accordyng herevnto S. Auguſtine againſte the Donatiſtes geueth for a rule, the ſacramētes to be one in all, although they be not one that receiue &amp; vſe them. And therfore to knytte vp this matter for the purpoſe, I entende and wryte it. For wemuſt conſidre the ſubſtance of the viſible Sacramēt, of Chriſtes body and bloud to be always as of it ſelfe it is by Chriſtes ordinaunce, in the vnderſtandyng whereof, this auctor maketh variaūce, and wold haue it by Chriſtes ordinaūce but a figure / which he hath not proued (but and he had prowed it) then is it in ſubſtaunce but a figure, and but a figure to good men. For it muſt be in ſubſtaunce one to good and bad: and ſo neyther to good nor bad this Sacramēt is otherwiſe diſpenſed then it is truely taught to be by preachyng. Wherfore if it be more then a figure, as it is in deade, &amp; if by Chriſtes ordynance

it hath preſēt vnder the forme of thoſe viſible ſygnes of the fourme of bread and wyne, the very body and bloud of Chriſt as hath been truly taught hitherto. Then is the ſubſtaunce of the Sacrament one always as the oyntement, was whether doues eate of it or betels. And this Iſſue, I ioyne with this An iſſue. auctor, that he ſhall not be able by any learnyng to make any diuerſite in the ſubſtaunce of this ſacrament, what ſoeuer diuerſite folowe in theffect. For the diuerſite of theffect, is occaſioned in them that receyue as before is proued. And thē to anuſwere this auctor, I ſay that onely good men eate and drinke the body and bloud of Chriſt ſpiritually, as I haue declared, but al good &amp; euel receiue the viſible Sacrament of that ſubſtaunce: God hath ordeyned it, whiche in it hathe no variance, but is all one to good and euel. And as for the Scriptures and doctours which this auctor allegeth to proue that onely good men receyne the body and bloud of Chriſt, I grant it without contention ſpeakyng of ſpitituall manducation and with lyuely faythe without the Sacrament. But in the viſible Sacrament euell men receyue the ſame that good men do, for the ſubſtance of the Sacrament is by good ordinance all one. And if this auctor would vſe for a proufe that in the Sacrament Chriſtes verye bodye is not preſēt becauſe euel mē receiue it, that ſhalbe no argument, for the good ſeed when it was

ſowen did fall in the euell grounde, and althought chriſt dwelleth not in the euel man, yet he maye be receyued of the euell man to his condempnation, becauſe he receyue him not to glorifie him as of God, as S. Paule ſayth (Non dijudicans corpus domini), not eſtemyng our Lordes bodye, And to all that euer this auctor bryngeth to proue that euel men eare not the body of chriſt, (may be ſaid wortely) that ſpiritually they eate it, not beſides the ſacramēt, &amp; in the ſacramēt they eate it, not effectually to lyfe, but cōdēpnatiō. And that is, &amp; may be called a not eating, As they be ſaid not to heare the worde of God, that heare it not proufitably. And becauſe the body of Chriſt of it ſelfe is ordeyned to be eatē for lyfe, thoſe that vnworthely eate condempnatiō, although they eate in dede, maye be ſaid not eate, becauſe they eate vnworthely as a thyng not well done, may be in ſpeache called not done in reſpecte of the good effect. Wherfore it was chefly ordred to be done. And by this rule, thou reader maſt diſcuſſe al that this auctor bryngeth forth for his purpoſe, eyther out of Scriptures or doctours. For euell men eate not the bodye of Chriſte, to haue any frute by it, as euell men be ſaid not to heare goddes worde to haue any frute by it, and yet as they here the worde of ſpirite and lyfe and neuer theles periſhe: ſo euel men eate in the viſible Sacramē
                  
                     •
                   the bodye of Chriſt &amp; yet periſhe, And as I ſaid,

thus anſwerith the Scripture with the particuler ſaynges of Cypriā. Athanaſe, Baſyl, hierome, and Ambroſe.
               As for ſainct Auguſtine whiche this auctor Auguſti. allegeth (De ciuitate dei), the ſame S. Auguſtine doth playnly ſay there in the place alleged, howe the good and euell receyue the ſame ſacrement, and addith but not with like proffite, whiche wordes this auctor ſuppreſſeth and therfore dealith not ſyncerely. As for ſainct Auguſtin ſhalbe herafter more playnely declared. Finally, he that receyueth worthely the body and bloud of Chriſt hath euerlaſting life, dwelleth in Chriſt, &amp; Chriſt in him, he that receyueth vnworthely, which can be onelye in the Sacrament receyueth not life, but condempnation. But to encoūtre directly with this auctor, where he oppoſith by interrogation, and would be anuſwered, whither an vnrepentant ſynner that receyueth the Sacrmēt, hath Chriſtes body with in him or no. Marke reader this queſtion whiche declareth that auctor talkyth of the Sacrament, not as himſelfe teacheth, but as the true teaching is, although he mean other wiſe, for els howe could an vnrepētāt ſynner receyue Chriſt, but onely in the ſacramēt vnworthely? &amp; howe could he receyue him vnworthely &amp; he were not there? but to anuſwere to the queſtiō, I anſwere no: for it foloueth not, he receyued him, (Ergo) he hathe him in him, for the veſſel being not mete, he departed

from him, becauſe he was a ſynner, in whom he dwelleth not. And where this auctor now become a queſtioniſte, maketh two queſtions of Chriſtes bodye, and his ſpirite, as tough Chriſtes body might be deuided from his ſpirite, he ſuppoſeth other to be as ignorant as himſelfe. For the lerned man will anſwere that the euel man by force of gods ordinance in the ſubſtance of the Sacrament receyued in deade Chriſtes very body there preſēt, hol Chriſt, god and man, but he taryed not, nor Dwelled not, nor fructified not in him, nor Chriſtes ſpirite entred not into that mannes ſowle, becauſe of the malice and vnworthynes of him that receyued. For Chriſt wil not dwell with Belial nor abide with ſynners. 2. Cor. 6. And what hath this auctor wonne nowe by his forked queſtion? wherin he ſemethe to glorie as though he had embraced an abſurdite that he hunted for, wherin he ſheweth onely his ignoraunce, who putteth no difference bytwen thentryag of Chriſte into an euell man by goddes ordynance in the Sacramēt, and the dwellyng of Chriſtes ſpirite in an euel man, whiche by Scripture can not be, ne is by any Catholique man affirmed. For ſainct Paule ſaythe. In him that receyuethe vnworthely remaynethe iudgement, and condempnation. And yet Sainct Pauls wordes playnelye importe that thoſe did eate the verye bodye of Chriſte, whiche did eate vnworthely, and therfore were gyltie

of the body and bloud of Chriſt. Now reader 1. Cor. 11 conſider what is before wryten, and thou ſhalt eaſelie ſee what a fonde cuncluſiō this auctor gathereth, in the. 97. leafe, as though the teachyng were that the ſame mā, ſhould be both the temple of God and the temple of the dewel, with other termes wherwith it liketh this auctour to refreſhe himſelfe and fayneth an aduerſarye, ſuche as he woulde haue, but hath none. For no Catholique man teacheth ſo, nor it is not all one to receyue Chriſt and to haue Chriſt dwellyng in him. And a figure therof was in Chriſtes conuerſation vpon earthe, whō taryed not with all that receyued him in outward apparance. And there is noted a difference that ſumme beleued in Chriſt, and yet Chriſt committed Ioh. 3. not himſelfe to them. And the Goſpell prayſeth them that heare the worde of God and Luce. 11. kepe it, ſignifiyng many to here the worde of God and not to kepe it, as they that receyue Chriſt by his ordinaunce in the Sacrament, and yet becauſe thei receyue him not accordyng to thentent of his ordinance worthely, they are ſo much the worſe therby, through ther owne malyce. And therfore to conclude this place with thauctor who ſoeuer eateth Chriſtes fleſhe and drynketh his bloud hathe euerlaſtynge life with Saincte Paulles expoſition, if he dothe it worthely, or elles by the ſame Saincte Paule he hathe condempnacion. 1.

In the .xcvij. leafe and the ſeconde colūne, thauctor begynneth to trauerſe the wordes of Sainct Paul to the Corinthians, &amp; would diſtincte vnworthy eatyng in the ſubſtaunce of the Sacrament receyued, whiche cannot be. For oure vnworthynes cannot altare the ſubſtance of gods Sacramente, that is euermore all one, howeſoeuer we ſwarue frome worthines to vnworthines. And this I wold aſke of this auctor, why ſhoulde it be a faulte in the vnworthye, not to eſteme the Lordes body, when he is taught, if this auctors doctrine be true, that it is not there at al? If this bread after this auctors teachyng be but a figure of Chriſtes body it is then but as Māna was, the eatynge wherof, vnworthely, and vnfaythfully was no gilte of Chriſtes body. Eraſmus noteth theſe wordes of Saincte Eraſmꝰ Paul, to be gilty of our Lords body, to proue the prefence of Chriſtes body there, who com pareth ſuche an offender to the iewes that did ſhedde Chriſtes bloud maliciouſlye, as thoſe do prophane it vnprofitably, in which ſence the greke commentaryes do alſo expounde it. And where this auctor bryngeth in the wordes of Saincte Paule, as it were to poynte out the mattiere. Let a man examyne himſelfe, and ſo eate of the bread, and 1. Cor. 11 drynke of the cuppe, for he that eateth vnworthely. &amp;c. Theſe wordes of examinyng, and ſo eatyng, declare the thyng to be one,

ordred to be eaten, and all the care to be vſed on our ſyde, to eate worthely, or els Saincte Paule had not ſayd, and ſo eate. And when Saincte Paule 
                     •
                  ayth eate iudgemente, and this auctour wyll remembre himſelfe, he muſte call iudgement the effecte of that is eaten, and not the thyng eaten: For iudgement is neyther ſpirituall meate nor corporall, but the effecte of the eatynge of Chriſte in euell men, who is ſaluation to good, and iudgement to euel. And therfore as good men eatyng Chriſt, haue ſaluation, ſo euell men eatyng Chriſt, haue condempnation, and ſo for the diuerſitie of the eaters of Chriſtes bodye, foloweth as they be worthye and vnworthy, the effecte of condempnacion or lyfe, Chriſtes Sacrament and his worke alſo in the ſubſtance, of that Sacrament beyng alwayes one, and what ſo euer this auctor talketh otherwiſe in this matter is mere trifles. And yet he goth about (becauſe he will make all thynge clere,) to anſwer ſuche authours as the Papiſtes he ſayth brynge for there Auguſti. purpoſe. And firſt he begynneth with ſainct Auguſtine who wryteth as playuelye againſt this auctours mynde, as I would haue diuiſed it, if I had no conſcience of truth more then I ſee ſum haue, and might with a ſecrete wiſhe haue altred S. Auguſtineas I had liſte. And therfore here I make a playne iſſue with this auctour, that in the ſerchyng An iſſue.
                  
of Sainct Auguſtine, he hath truſted his mā, or his frende ouer negligentely in ſo great a matter, or he hath willyngly gone aboute to deceyue the reader. For in the place of Saint Auguſtine againſte the Donatiſtes alleged here by this auctour, whiche he would with the reſt aſſoyle: Sainct Auguſtine hath theſe formal wordes in Latyn. Corpus Domini, &amp;

It was neuertheles the body of our Lorde, &amp; the bloud of our Lorde alſo vnto them, to whom thappoſtel ſayde, he that eateth vnworthely, eateth and drynketh iudgement to himſelfe. Theſe be Saincte Auguſtines wordes, who writeth notably and euidently, that it was neuertheles the body, and bloud of Chriſt to them that receyued vnworthely, declaryng that their vnworthynes, doth not aultre the ſubſtance of that Sacrament, and doth vs to vnderſtande therwith, the ſubſtaunce of the ſacramēt, to be the body and bloud of Chriſt, and neuertheleſſe ſo though the receyuers be vnworthy wherin this auctor is ſo ouerſene, as I thinke, there was neuer learned mā before, that durſt in a comen welthe, where lerned men be, publiſh ſuche an vntruth as this is, to be anſwered in a tong that men knowe. Yet Peter Martyr wrote in Latyn, and reioyſeth

not, I thinke, to haue his lyes in Engliſh. I will bryng in here an other place of ſainct Auguſtine to this purpoſe. Illud etiam

                        que
                      ipſe videbat, quando

iſta dicebat. The engliſſe of theſe wordes is this. That ſame, that he alſo ſayth, who eateth my fleſh and drynketh my bloud, dwelleth in me and I in him, howe ſhall we vnderſtande it? May we vnderſtande alſo them of whome the Apoſtle ſpake, that they did eate to them ſelfe, and drynke iudgement, when they did eate the ſame fleſh and drinke the ſame bloud, the fleſhe it ſelfe, the bloud it ſelfe? did not Iudas the mycked ſeller and betrayer of his maiſter, whē he did eate, and drynke (as Lucas the euangeliſte declareth) the firſt Sacrament of the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt made with his owne handes, dwell in Chriſte or Chriſte in him? Finally many that with a fayned hearte eate that fleſh and drynke the bloud, or when they haue eaten and dronken become apoſtatas, do not they dwell in Chriſt or Chriſt in them? But vndowtedly there is a certayne maner of eatyng that fleſhe, and drynkyng that bloud, after whiche maner, who ſo euer eateth and drynketh, dwelleth in Chriſt and Chriſt in him. Therfore not in what ſo euer maner any man eateth the fleſhe of Chriſt, and drynketh the bloud of Chriſt, he dwelleth in chriſt and Chriſt in him, but after a certayne maner, whiche maner he ſawe when he ſayde theſe wordes. This is the ſence of Saincte Auguſtines ſaiynge in Latyn, wherby appeareth the fayth of Sainct Auguſtine to be in the Sacrament, to be eaten and dronken,

very body and bloud of Chriſt, which for the ſubſtance of the Sacrament, euel men receyue as good men do, that is to ſay, as Sainct Auguſtin doth poynte it out by his wordes, the ſame fleſh, and the ſame bloud of Chriſt, with ſuche an expreſſe ſpeache, as he would exclude all difference, that diuiſe of figure might imagine, and therfore ſayth (ipſam car nem, ipſum ſanguinem.) Whiche ſignifyeth the ſelfe ſame, in dead, not by name onely as the auctor of the booke would haue Saincte Auguſtine vnderſtanded, and when that appeareth, as it is mooſt manifeſte, that Iudas receyued the ſame beynge wycked, that good men do, howe the ſame is before the recept by gods omnipotencye preſent in the viſible Sacrament, and ſo not receyued by the onely inſtrument of fayth, whiche in euell men is not lyuely, but by the inſtrument of the mouthe, wherein it entreth with the viſible element. And yet as Saincte Auguſtine ſayth, dwelleth not in him that ſo vnworthely receiueth, becauſe the effect of dwellyng of Chriſte is not in him that receyueth by ſuche a maner of eatyng, as wycked men vſe. Wherby S. Auguſtine teacheth, the diuerſe effecte to enſue of the diuerſite of the eatyng, &amp; not of any diuerſite of that whiche is eaten, whither the good man, or euell man recyue the Sacrament: If I would here encō
                  bre the reader, I coulde bryng forth many

mo places of ſaincte Auguſtine to the confuſiō and reproufe of this auctors purpoſe, and yet notwithſtandyng to take awaye that he might ſaye of me, that I waye not Saincte Auguſtine, I thynke good to allege &amp; bryng forth the iudgement of Martyn Bucer, touchyng ſaincte Auguſtine, who vnderſtandeth ſaincte Auguſtine clere contrary to this auctor, as maye playnely appeare by that the ſayde Bucer writeth in fewe wordes in his Epiſtell dedicatorye of the greate worke he ſente abrode of his enarracions of the Goſpelles, where his iudgement of Sainct Auguſtine in this poynte he vttereth thus. Quoties ſcribit etiam Iudam ipſum corpus &amp; ſanguinem Domini ſumpſiſſe? Nemo ita

Howe often wryteth he (ſpeakyng of Sainct Auguſtine) Iudas alſo to haue receiued the ſelfe body and bloud of our Lorde? No man therfore by the auctoritie of the fathers can ſaye Chriſte to be abſente in the holye ſoupper. Thus ſayth Bucer who vnderſtandeth Saincte Auguſtine, as I haue before alleaged him, and gathereth there of a concluſion that no man can by the fathers ſaiynges proue Chriſte to be abſente in the holye ſoupper. And therfore by Bucers iudgemente, the doctrine of this auctour, can be in no wiſe Catholique as

diſſentynge frome that hathe been before taught and beleued. Whither Bucer wyll ſtyl continue in that he hath ſo ſolenly publiſhed to the world, and by me here alleaged: I can not tell, and whither he do, or no, it maketh no matter, but thus he hathe taught in his latter iudgement, with A great proteſtation that he ſpeaketh without reſpecte other then to the truthe, wherin becauſe he ſemed to diſſent from his freundes he ſayth,

                     us in eplam. 1. Cor. 2. auctor, who ſayth playnly in his commentaryes vpon S. Paule, howe Chriſt delyuered to Iudas his precious bodye and bloud, and declareth further therwith in that ſacramēt to be the truthe. So as this auctor can haue no foundation vpon eyther to maynten his figuratiue ſpeach, or the matter of this fourth booke, whiche his wordes playnely impugne ſainct Hierome in his commentaties Hierome. vpon the prophete Malachie hath firſt this ſentence. Poſſumus panem, ideſt corpus chriſti, quando indigni accedimus ad altare, &amp;

ſordidi mundum ſanguinem bibimus. We defile the bread, that is to ſaye, the bodye of chriſt whē we cume vnworthely to thalrare, and beynge fylthy drinke the cleane bloud. Thus ſayth S. Hierome who ſayth fylthy men drinke the cleane bloud, and in an other place after the ſame Sainct Hierome ſayth. (Polluit chriſti myſteria indigne accipiens corpus eius &amp; ſanguinē.) He that vnworthly receyueth the body &amp; bloud of Chriſt defyleth the myſteries. Can any wordes be more manifeſt &amp; euidēt to declare S. Hieroms mynde howe in the viſible ſacramēt men receyue vnworthely, whiche be euil men the bodye and bloud of Chriſt and yet theſe playne places of auctoritie diſſembled of purpoſe, or by ignoraunce paſſed ouer this auctor, as tough This auctor. all thynges were by him clearly diſcuſſed to his entēt, would by many cōceytes furniſhe &amp; further his matters, &amp; therfore playeth with our ladyes ſmyling rocking hir child &amp; many good mowes, ſo vnſemely for his perſō that it maketh me almoſt forget him &amp; my ſelfe alſo. But with ſuch matterhe filleth his leaues forgettyng himſelfe maketh mētiō of the cathechiſme by him trāſlate, thoriginall wherof, cōfuteth theſe two partes of this booke in few words being prynted in germany, wherin beſides the matter wrytē, is ſetforth in pictur the maner of the miniſtring of this ſacra mēt, where is the altare with cādel light let forth the prieſt apparelled after the old ſort,

and the man to receiue kneling barehed &amp; holdyng vp his handes, whiles the prieſt myuiſ
                     •
                  reth the hoſt to his mouth, a matter as clere contrarye to the matter of this booke as is light and darkneſſe, which nowe this auctor would colour with ſpeaches of auctors, in a booke wryten to inſtructe rude childrē, which is as ſclendre an excuſe as euer was harde, &amp; none at al when thoriginall is loked on.
               Emiſſene to ſtirre vp mens deuotion cumyng Emiſſen to receyue this Sacrament, requireth the roote and foundatiō therof, in the mynde of man as it ought to be &amp; therfore exorteth men to take the ſacramēt with thande of the harte, &amp; drinke with the dranght of the inwarde man, whiche men muſt nedes do that will worthely repare to this feaſte. And as Emiſſene ſpeaketh theſe deuoute wordes of thin warde office of the receyuer, ſo dothe he in declaration of the myſtrie ſhewe, howe the Inuiſible prieſt with his ſecrete power by his worde doth conuert the viſible cratures in to the ſubſtance of his body and bloud, whereof I haue before entrated. This auctor vpon theſe wordes deuontly ſpoken by Emiſſene ſay the there is required no corporall preſence of Chriſtes precious bodye in the Sacrament, continuynge in his ignoraunce what the worde corporall meaneth. But to ſpeake of Emiſſene if by his fay the, the verye bodye and bloud of Chriſte were not preſent vpon the altare, why dothe he

calle it a reuerend altare? why to be fed there with ſpirituall meates? and why ſhould fayth be required to lake vpon the bodye and bloud of Chriſt, that is not there on thaltare, but as this auctor teacheth onely in heauen. and why ſhould he that cummeth to be fede honnor thoſe myſteries there, &amp; why ſhould Emiſſene allude to thande of the harte and draught of the inwarde man if the hande of the bodye and draught of thoutwarde man had none office there? All this were vayne cloquence, and a mere abuſe and illuſion, if the Sacramentall tokens were only a figure &amp; if there were no preſēce but in figure? why ſhould not Emiſſene reather haue folowed the plaine ſpech of thāgel to the women that ſought Chriſt, (Ieſum quaeritis non eſt hic) ye ſeke Ieſus he is not here, And ſay as this auctor doth this is onely a figure, do no worſhip here, goo vp to heauē, and downe with thaltare for feare of illuſion which Emiſſene dyd not, but called it a reuerend aulter, and inuiteth him that ſhould receyue to honnor that foode, with ſuch good wordes as before ſo far deſcrepaūte frō this auctors teaching, as may be, and yet from him he taketh occaſion to ſpeake againſt adoration.
               As touching thadoratiō of Chriſtes fleſhe in the Sacramēt (whiche adoration is a true confeſſion of the holemans ſoule, and body, if there be opportunite, of the truthe of God in his worke) is in my indgement well ſetforth

in the booke of cōmō prayor, where the prieſt is ordred to knele, and make a prayor in his owne, and the name of all that ſhall communicate, confeſſyng therin that is prepared there, at whiche tyme neuertheleſſe, that is not adored that the bodelye eie ſceth, but that whiche fay the knoweth to be there inuiſibly preſēt, whiche and there be nothyng (as this auctor nowe teacheth) it were not well. I wyll not anſwere this auctors eloquēce, but his matter, where it might hurte, as in the wronge reporte of Saincte Auguſtine, who ſpeakyng of the adoration of Chriſtes fleſhe geuen to be eaten, doth ſo fation his ſpeache, as it cannot with any violence be drawen, to ſuche an vnderſtandyng, as though S. Auguſtine ſhould meane of thadoryng of Chriſtes fleſhe in heauen as this auctor woulde haue it. S. Auguſtine ſpeaketh of the geuyng of Chriſtes fleſh to vs to ea
                     •
                  e, and declareth after, that he meaneth in the viſible Sacrament, whiche muſt be Inuiſibly vnderſtāded and ſpiritually, not as the Capharnaites did vnderſtand Chriſtes wordes carnally to eate that body cutte in piaces, and therfore there may be no ſuche imaginations to eate Chriſtes bodye after the maner he walked here, nor drinke his bloud as it was ſhed vpon the croſſe, but it is a myſtery and ſacrament that is godly of gods worke ſupernaturall aboue mannes vnderſtandyng, and therfore ſpiritually vnderſtanded ſhall giue life, whiche

life carnall vnderſtandyng muſt nedes exclude. And by theſe my wordes I thynke I declare trully ſainct Auguſtines meanynge of the truthe of this Sacrament, wherin Chriſt geueth truely his fleſhe to be eaten, the fleſhe he ſpeake of before, taken of the virgin. For the ſpirituall vnderſtandynge that ſainct Auguſtine ſpeaketh of, is not to exclude the truthe of goddes worke in the Sacrament, but to extlude carnall imagination, from muſyng of the maner of the worke, whiche is in myſterye ſuche as a carnall man can not comprehende. In whiche matter yf ſainct Auguſtine had had ſuche a faythe of the viſible ſacramēt, as this auctor ſayth himſelfe hath nowe of late, and calleth it Catholique ſainct Auguſtine would haue vttered it as an expoſitor playnely in this place and ſaid ther is but a figure of Chriſts body, Chriſtes bodye and fleſhe is in heuen, and not in this viſible Sacramēt, Chriſtes ſpeache that was eſtemed ſo hard, was but a figuratiue ſpeach and where Chriſt ſaid (This is my bodye) he ment onely of the figure of his body, whiche maner of ſaynges ſainct Auguſtine vſeth not in this place, and yet he coulde ſpeake playnly and ſo doth he declarynge vs firſte the truthe of the fleſhe, that Chriſt geueth to be eaten, that is to ſaye the ſame fleſhe that he tooke of the virgen. And yet becauſe chriſt

geneth it not in a viſible maner nor ſuche a maner as the Capharnaites thought on, nor ſuche a maner as any carnall man can conceyue, beynge alſo the fleſhe geuen in the Sacramēt not a common fleſhe but a lyuely, godly, and ſpirituall fleſhe.
               Therfore ſainct Auguſtine vſeth wordes and ſpeache, wherby he denieth the gift of that bodye of Chriſt, whiche we did ſee, and of the bloude that was ſhed: ſo as by affirmation and deniall ſo nere together of the ſame to be geuen and the ſame not to be geuen: the myſterye ſhoulde be thus far opened, that for the truthe of the thynge geuen it is the ſame, and touchynge the maner of the geuynge and the qualitie of the fleſhe geuen, it is not the ſame. And becauſe it is the ſame, Sainct Anguſtine ſayeth before we muſte worſhippe it, and yet becauſe it is nowe an hidden godly myſterye, we maye not haue carnall Imaginations of the ſame, but godly, ſpiritually, and inuiſibly vnderſtande it. And becauſe ſainct Hierome, who was of ſainct Auguſtines tyme, writeth in his commentaries Hierony mus ad Epheſios. 
                        〈◊〉
                     . vpon ſainct Paule, (Ad Epheſios,) that maye ſerue for the better openynge hereof, I wyll write it in here. The wordes be theſe. The bloude and fleſhe of Chriſte is two wayes vnderſtanded, eyther the

ſpiritually &amp; godly of whiche him ſelfe ſaid, my fleſhe is verely meat and my bloud is verely drynke, and onleſſe ye eat my fleſhe and drinke my bloud ye ſhal not haue euerlaſting life. Or the fleſhe whiche was crucified and bloud whiche was ſhed with the ſpere, Accordyng to this diuiſiō, the diuerſite of fleſhe and bloud, is taken in Chriſtes ſainctes that there is one fleſhe, that ſhall ſee the ſalnatiō of God, an other fleſhe and bloud that can not poſſeſſe the kyngdome of heauen.
               Theſe be S. Iheromes wordes. In which thowe ſeeſt reader a denyall of that fleſhe of Chriſt to be geuen to be eaten that was crucified, but the fleſhe geuen to be eaten to be a godly and ſpirituall fleſhe, and a diſtinction made betwene them as is in oure fleſhe, of whiche it may be ſayde that the fleſhe we walke in here, ſhall not ſee God, that is to ſay, as it is corruptible accordyng to the text of S. Paul, fleſhe and bloud ſhal not poſſeſſe heauen and yet not withſtanding we muſte beleue and hope with Iob truely, that the ſame oure fleſhe ſhal ſee god in heauen, after whiche diuiſion, likewiſe we receyue not in the Sacrament Chriſtes fleſhe that was crucified, beyng ſo a viſible and mortall fleſhe, but Chriſtes fleſhe glorified incorruptible &amp; impaſſible a godly and ſpirituall fleſhe, And ſo that is but one in ſubſtaunce and alwayes ſo: the ſame one is neuertheleſſe for thalteration in the maner of the beyng of it diuided &amp;

ſo called not the ſame, wherin ſainct Hierome and ſaincte Auguſtine, vſed both one maner of ſpeakinge and ſainct Hierome reſemblinge the diuiſiō that he reherſith of chriſtes fleſh, to the diuiſion of oure fleſh in the reſurrection, dothe more plainely open, howe the ſame maye be called not the ſame, becauſe we beleue certainlye the reſurrection of the ſame fleſh we walke in, and yet it ſhall be by the garment of incorruptibilite not the ſame in qualite, and ſo be verified the ſcriptures that fleſh ſhall not poſſeſſ heauen and I ſhall ſee god in my fleſh. And here I will note to the reader by the waye ſainct Hierome wrireth this diſtinctiō of Chriſts fleſh, as a matter aggreed on, and then in catholique doctrine receyued, not of his inuention, but in the catholique faythe, as aprincipal eſtabliſhed, whiche declareth the belef, to haue ben of that very godly, and ſpirituall fleſhe, geuen really in the Sacrament. For ells to eate onely in fayth is ſpiritually to remembre Chriſt fleſh, as it was viſiblie crucified, wherin was accō
                  pliſhed thoblacon for oure ſinnes, and ſainct Poule willeth vs in the ſupper, to ſhew forth, and to profeſſe the death of Chriſt, for ſo Chriſt wolde haue his death continually expreſſed, till his cumminge. And if ſainct Hierome with other ſhoulde haue ment of the eatinge of Chriſt as he ſitteth in heauen reigninge, this diſtinction of Chriſtes fleſh, were an idle mattier, and oute of purpoſe, to compare

the diſtinction in it, to be like the dinſtinction of our fleſh to entre into heauen, and not to entre in to heauen, the ſame and not the ſame. And thus I ſaye that this place of ſainct Hierome ſheweth ſo euidently both his and ſainct Auguſtines fayth that writ at the ſame tyme, as there cannot be deſired a more euident matter.
               But to retourne to ſaincte Auguſtine touchinge adoration if the very fleſh of Chriſte were not in the Sacrament truely preſent, whiche is as moche to ſaye as in ſubſtaunce preſent, if it were not in deade preſent that is to ſaye reallye preſent, if it wer not corporallye preſēt that is to ſaye, the very, body of Chriſte there preſent god and man? If thieſe truthes conſentinge in one were not there ſaincte Auguſtine wolde neuer haue ſpoken of adoracion there. Nomore he doth ſayth this auctor there, but in heauē, let ſainct Auguſtines wordes quod I be indge, whiche be thieſe, no man eatith that fleſhe but he firſte worſhipith it. It is founde out howe ſuche a 98. Pſal. fote ſtole of the lordesfote ſholde be worſhipped &amp; not onely that we do not ſinne in worſhippinge but we do ſinne in not worſhippinge it. Thieſe be ſaincte Auguſtines wordes, whiche before cānot be draiwen to an vnderſtandinge of the worſhippinge of Chriſtes fleſh in heauen, where it remayneth cōtinuallye glorified, and is of all men Chriſtened, cō

And when I ſaye in his humanite I ſpeake not properly as that miſterie requireth, for as Chriſts perſon is but one of two perfite natures, ſo the adoration is but one as Cyrill declareth it, and therfore abhorreth thadition of a ſyllable to ſpeake of coadoration. And will this auctor attribute to ſainct Auguſtine ſuch a groſſneſſe to haue written and giuen for a leſſon, that no man ſynneth to worſhippe Chriſts fleſh in heauē reiguinge in glory? wherfore takinge this to be ſoo far from all probabilite, I ſayde before theſe wordes of ſainct Auguſtine, cannot be drawen with any teynters to ſtretche ſo far as to reache to heauen, where euery Chriſten man knowith and profeſſith the worſhippinge of Chriſt in glory as they be taught alſo

foote ſtoole of my feete. But yet the earth is not to be worſhipped of vs, bicauſe it is a creature of god. And yet let vs ſee thoughe leſte the prophete meane that earth to be worſhipped, whiche oure Lorde Ieſus toke in the takinge of fleſhe. So then by the fote ſtole let the earthe be vnderſtanded, and then by the earth the fleſh of Chriſt, vhiche we do nowe Worſhippe alſo in the myſteries, and whiche the appoſteles as we haue before ſaide worſhipped in oure lorde I heſu, for Chriſte is not deuided but one. Hitherto S. Ambroſe, whereby maye appere howe ſaincte Ambroſe, and ſainct Auguſtine, toke occaſiō to open there fayth and doctrine touchinge adoracion, vppon diſcuſſion of the ſelf ſame wordes of the prophete dauid▪ And S. Ambroſe expreſſely notith oure adoracion in the myſteries, where we worſhippe chriſtes fleſh I nuiſiblie preſent, as the appoſtelles did, when Chriſte was viſibly preſent with thē. And thus with thieſe ſo playne wordes of ſainct Ambroſe conſonante to thoſe of ſaincte Auguſtine, and the openinge of S. Auguſtines wordes as before, I truſte I haue made manifeſt, howe this auctor trauaileth againſte the ſtreame, and laborith in vaine to wrieth ſaincte Auguſtine to his purpoſe in this matter. The beſte is in this auctor that he audeleth ſaincte Auguſtine no worſe then the reſte, but all after one ſorte, becauſe they be all of like ſorte againſte his

newe catholique faith, and conferme the olde trew catholique faith or do not improue it. For of this highe miſterie, thauctors write ſumme more obſcurely, and decklye, then other, and vſe diuerſites of ſpeaches, &amp; wordes wher with the true doctrine hath been of a very fewe impugned, but euer in vayne, as I truſte in god ſhalbe moſte in vaine, Hahinge this auctor vttred ſuche vntruthes with ſumo

               ¶ The confutation of the ſeconde booke.
               
                  HAuinge declared how much again all trueth this auctor would beare in hand, that the reall preſence, the corporall preſence, and ſubſtanciall preſence of Chriſtes moſt precyous body and bloud in the Sacrament, is not the true Catholique doctrine, but a diuiſe of the Papiſtes, which is a terme wherwith this auctor doth vncharitablye charge the kynges true ſubiectes, amonges whom he knoweth a great many to be of that faith he calleth nowe Papiſtes: But ſettyng wordes a parte and to cume to the mattier as I haue ſhewed this auctor to erre partelye by willfulnes, partelye by ignoraunce in thunderſtandyng of the olde auctors, concernyng the true real preſence of Chriſtes bodye and bloud in the Sacramēt: So I truſt to ſhewe this auctor ouerſeen in tharticle of tranſubſtantiacion. For entre wherunto, firſt I ſaye thus, that albeit the worde tranſubſtantiacion, was firſt ſpokē of by publique auctorite in that aſſemble of learned men of Chriſtendome, in a generall conſayle, where the Byſſhppe of rome was preſent, yet the true matter ſignified by that worde, was older and beleued before, vpon the true vnderſtandyng of Chriſtes wordes, &amp; was in that counſaile confeſſed, not for the auctorite of the Byſhop

of rome, but for thauctorite of trueth, beyng tharticle, ſuche as toucheth not the auctorite of the Byſhop of rome, but the true doctrine of Chriſtes myſteries, and therfore in this realme, thauctorite of rome c

                  ſſing, was alſo cōfeſſed for a truth by all the clergye of this realme in an open cōſaile, ſpecially diſcuſſed, and though the hardenes of the law that by parliamēt was eſtabliſhed, of that and other articles hath been repelled, yet that doctrine was neuer hitherto by any publique conſaile or any thynge ſet forth by auctorite empayred, that I haue hard, wherfore me thinketh this auctor ſhuld not improue it by the name of the Biſhop of rome, ſeynge we rede howe truth was vttred by Balaā &amp; caiph as alſo, &amp; Num. 22 Iohā. 11. S. Paul teacheth the Philippēſes that whither it be by cōtencion or enuye, ſo Chriſt be preached the perſon ſhuld not empaire thop

In the diſcuſſion of whiche truth of trāſubſtātiaciō, I for my part ſhuld be ſpecially defended by two meanes wherwith to anoyde the enuious name of Papiſt. One is that zuinglius himſelfe, who was no Papiſt as is well knowē, nor god chriſtē mā as ſume ſayd neyther, ſayth play

                   or gabriel, to write in it, whoſe ſayinges this auctor vſith for his pleaſure. An other defence: is that this auctor himſelfe ſaith that it is ouer greate an abſurdite to ſaye that breade inſenſible with many other termes that he addith ſhulde be the bodye of Chriſte, and therfore. I thinke that the (is) that is to ſaye, the inwarde nature &amp; eſſence of that Chriſte deliuered in his ſupper to be eaten and drōcken, was of his body &amp; bloud, and not of the bread and wyne, and therfore canne well agree with this auctor that the bread of wheate is not the body of Chriſte / nor the bodie of Chriſte made of it as of a matter, whiche conſideracions will enforce

him that beleueth the trueth of the preſence of the ſubſtāce of Chriſtes body, as the treue catholique faith teachith, to aſſent to tranſubſtantiacion, not as determined by the churche of Rome, but as a cōſequēt of treuth beleued ī the miſterie of the ſacramēt, which tranſubſtantiaciō how this auctor wolde impugne, I wil without quarel of ēuious wordes cōſider, &amp; with true opening of his hādeling the mattier: doubte not to make the reader to ſee that he fighteth againſt the trueth.
               I will paſſe ouer the vnreuerent handelinge of Chriſtes wordes (This is my body) which wordes I harde this auctor (if it be the ſame that is named) ones reherſe more ſeriouſly in a ſolē

But to the purpoſe the ſimplicite of faith in a Chriſten mans breſt, doth not ſo preciſely marke &amp; ſtay at the ſillables of Chriſtes wordes, as this auctor pretendith, and knowinge by faith the truth of Chriſtes wordes, that as he ſaid he wrought doo not meaſure goddes ſecret working, after the ꝓlacion of our ſillables, whoſe worke is in one inſtaūce how ſoeuer ſpeche in vs require a ſucceſſiue vttraūce, &amp; the maner of hād linge, this auctor vſith to bringe the miſticall wordes in cōtēpte wer meater in an.

Here I would queſtiō with this auctor whither Chriſte ſaide ſo or no? and reaſon thus. Chriſtes body is no materiall breade, Chriſt ſaide This is my body, ergo he ſaide this is not bread. And the firſte parte of this reaſon this auctor affirmeth in the 59 leafe. And the ſeconde parte is Chriſt wordes, and therfore to auoyd this cōcluſion thonly waye is to ſay, that Chriſtes ſpeache was but a figure, which the catholik doctrine ſaieth is falſe? and therfore by the catholique doctrine Chriſtes ſayinge This is my bodie, ſayth in effecte This is no breade, wherat

this auctor ſayth they wolde brage if Chriſte had ſaide ſoo. In ſpeach is to be conſydered that euery yea cōteineth an nayin it naturaly ſo as whoſoeuer ſaith This is bread, ſayth it is no wine, whoſoeuer ſayth thys is wine, ſayth it is no breade. If a lapidarie ſaith this is a diamōde, he ſaithe it is no glaſſe, he ſaith it is no cryſtall, he ſayth it is no white ſafyer, So Chriſt ſaying this is my body, faith it is no breade whiche plainnes of ſpeache cauſed Suinglius to ſaye plainlye, if there be preſent the ſubſtaunce of the bodie of Chriſte there is tranſubſtantiacion, that is to ſaye, not the ſubſtaunce of breade, and therfore who will plainelye denie tranſubſtantiacion muſt denie the true preſence of the ſubſ

I haue ſhewed before how Chriſtes wordes were not figuratiue when he ſaide, this is my bodie, and yet I will touche here ſuche teſtimonie, as this anctor bringith oute of Hilarie, for the purpoſe of tranſubſtantiacion in the, xxv. leefe of this booke in thieſe wordes. There is a figure ſaith H

                  arie / for bread and wine be out wardly ſeen, &amp; there is alſo a trueth of that figure, for the bodye and bloud of Chriſte be of a trueth inwardelye beleued. Thieſe be Hilaries wordes as this auctor allegith thē, who was he ſaith within 350 yeres of chriſt. Nowe I call to thy Iudgment goode reader coulde

any mā diuiſe more pithiewordes for the proufe of the real preſence of Chriſtes body &amp; bloud, &amp; the cōdēpnaciō of this auctor that wolde haue an onely figure? Here in hilaries wordes is a figure cōpared to trueth, &amp; ſight but wardly to belief inwardly. Nowe our beliefe is grounded vppō goddes worde which is this: This is my body, in which wordes hilarie teſtifieth that is inwardly beleued is a trueth, &amp; the figure is in that is ſeē outwardly, I take hilarie here as this auctor allegith him. wherby I aſke the reader is not this auctor auerthrowē that chriſt ſpeache is not figuratiue, but true &amp; proper beinge inwardly trewe that we byleue? Ye will ſaye vnto me what is this to trāſubſtātiaciō, to the reproufe wherof, it was brought in? becauſe he ſaith bread, &amp; wine are ſeen. Firſt I ſaye, that it ouerthroweth this auctor fortruth, of the preſēce of chriſtes body, &amp; euery ouerthrow therin, ouerthroweth this auctor in trāſubſtā
                  tiaciō, not by auctorite of the churche of Rome, but by cōſequence in truth as Suinglius ſaith, who ſhal ſerue me to auoyde papiſtrie. If one aſke me, what ſay ye thēne to hilarie that bread &amp; wine areſeē? I ſay they be in dead ſeē, for they appere ſo, &amp; therfore be callid ſo, as Iſaac ſayd of Iacob, it was his voice, &amp; yet by his ſence of feling, denied him Eſau, which was not Eſau, Gene. 27. but was Iacob, as the voyce frō within did declare him. If ye will aſke me howe canne there (according to hilaries wordes) be in the outwarde viſible creatures any figure, onles the ſame be in deade, as they appeare bread &amp; wine? I will anſwer euen as well as this out ward obiecte

of the ſēſible hearynes of Iacob, reſēblinge Eſau was a figure of chriſtes humanite &amp; of the ve ry humanite in deade. Thus may Hilarie be anſwered to anoyde hys auctorite from contraryinge trāſubſtātion.

after the benediction, whiche benediction was not ſpoken of in the bread, but yet muſt be vnderſtanded, As for Chriſtes callynge of bread his bodye, is to make it his bodye who as ſainct Paule ſayth calleth that is not, as it were, and ſo makethe it to be. Primo.
               
               Thargumentes this auctor vſeth in. 19. and. 20. leef of thordre of Chriſtes ſpeaches as the euangeliſtes reherſe them, be captious diuiſes of this auctor, in cace he knowethe what ſainct Auguſtine writeth, or els ignoraunce if he hathe not red ſainct Auguſtine, (De doctrina Chriſtiana) where he geuteh a rule of recapitulatiō as he calleth it, when that is tolde after that was done afore, and therfore we maye not argue ſo firmely vpon the ordre of the tellynge in the ſpeche. S. Auguſtine bryngeth an example Auguſtinus de doctrina 
                        〈◊〉
                     . libro. 3. Cap. 36. that by ordre of tellyng, Adam was in paradiſe or any tree was brought forth for feadyng, with diuerſe other, wherewith I will not encōbre the reader. Theuangeliſte reherſeth what Chriſt ſaid, and did ſimplye and truely, whiche ſtory we muſt ſo place in vnderſtandyng, as we tryfle not the myſterie, at ſtayng and ſtoppyng of lettres and ſyllables. And therfore though the worde (take, eate) goo before the wordes (This is my bodye) we may not argue that they tooke it and eate it afore chriſt had tolde them what he gaue them, and all theſe often reherſalles

of bread, with he toke bread, he brake bread, and bleſſed bread, and if ye will adde helde bread, all this induce no conſequence that he therfore gaue bread. For he gaue that he had conſecrate, and gaue that he made of breade. If Chriſte when he was tempted to make ſtones breade, had taken the ſtones and bleſſed them and delyuered them ſaiynge, This is bread, had he then delyuered ſtones, or rather that he made of ſtones bread? Such maner of reaſonyng vſeth Peter Martyr, as this auctor doth, whoſe foly I may well ſay he ſawe not to eſchwe it, but as appeareth rather to folowe it. And yet not content to vſe this fonde reaſonyng, this auctor calleth Papiſts to witneſſe, that they might lawgh at it, becauſe the Euāgeliſte telleth the ſtory ſo as Chriſt ſayde, (drincke) and then could after what it was, this auctor fanſieth that the Apoſtels ſhould be ſo haſty to drinke ere Chriſt had tolde them what he gaue, whiche &amp; they had, I thinke he woulde haue ſtayed the cuppe with his hande, or byd them rary, whiles he had tolde them more, I wil no further trauayle with this reſonyng, which it is pitie to heare in ſuche a matter of grauite, of ſuch cōſequence as it is: both in body &amp; ſoule. We maye not tryfle with Chriſtes wordes after this ſorte. When S. Paul ſayth, we be partakers of one bread, he ſpeaketh not of materiall breade, but of Chriſtes bodye oure heauenly bread, which to all is one, &amp; cannot

be conſumed, but able to fead all the worlde, and if this auctor geueth credite to Theodoretus, whom he calleth an holy man, thē ſhal he neuer fynde the Sacrament called bread after the ſanctificacion, but the bread of life, the like whereof ſhoulde be in an Epiſtell of Chryſoſtome, as Peter Martyr allegeth, not yet prynted, by whoſe auctorices if they haue any, as in there place this auctor maketh muche of them, al theſe argumentes be al tryfles, for all the namynge of bread by Chriſt, and Sainct Paule and all other, muſt be vnderſtanded before the ſanctificacion and not after. And if thou reader lokeſt after vpon Theodoretus, and that Epiſtell, Thou ſhalt fynde true that I ſaye, wherby all this queſtyoning with Papiſtes is onely a dalyinge for this auctour pleaſure againſte his owne auctors, and all learnynge.
               In the thirde Chapter wryten in the .xxi. leafe it troubleth this auctour that the doctrine of tranſubſtantiacion, is in his Iudgement againſte naturall reaſon, and naturall operacion, in the entrye of whiche matter he graunteth wiſely that they ſhoulde not preuayle againſt gods worde, and yet he ſaith, when they be ioyned with gods worde they be of a great moment to cōferme any trueth, wherin if he meaneth to cōfirme gods worde by reaſon, or gods myſteryes by natural operacion, myne vnderſtandynge cannot reache that doctrine, and is more ſtrange to me, then

this auctor maketh tranſubſtantiacion to be to him. As for the reaſon of (vacuum) declareth a (vacuum) that nature abhorreth not. And if we ſpeake after the rules of nature, quantite filleth the place rather then ſubſtance. And ſhortely to anſwer this auctor, it is not ſayd in the doctrine of tranſubſtautiat iō, that there remayneth nothyng, for in the viſible forme of bread, remayneth the propre obiec
                     •
                  e of euery ſence truly, that is ſeen with the bodely eye, is truely ſeen, that is felt is truly felt, that is ſauered is truely ſauered, &amp; thoſe thinges corrupte putrifie, nurriſne and conſume after the trueth of the former nature, God ſo ordryng it that create al, vſing ſingulerly that creature of breade not to vnitie it vnto him as he did mannes nature, to be in bread impanate, and breaded as he was in fleſhe incarnate. And as for reaſon in place of ſeruice as beyng inferior to fayth, will agree with the fayth of Tranſubſtantiacion welynoughe. For if our fayth of the true preſence of Chriſtes very body he true, as it is moſte true grounded vppon the wordes of Chriſt. (This is my body:) Then reaſon yeldyng in that truth, wyl not ſtryue with tranſubſtātiaciō, but plainly affirme that by here Iudgement, if it be the bodye of Chriſt it is not bread. For in the rule of comē reaſon, the graunte of one ſubſtance is the denyal of an other, &amp; therfore reaſon hathe theſe cōcluſiōs

througly, what ſoeuer is breade, is no wyne, what ſoeuer is wyne, is no milke, &amp; ſo forth. And therfore beynge ones beleued this to be the body of Chriſt, reaſon ſayth by and by, it is not breade, by the rule aforeſayde, wherby appeareth howe reaſon doth not ſtryue with tranſubſtantiacion, beynge ones conquered with fayth of the true preſence qf Chriſtes body, whiche is moſt euident, and no whitte darkened, by any thynge this auctour hath brought. As for naturall operation, is not in all mens Iudgementes as this auctour taketh it, who ſemeth to repute it for an inconuenience to ſaye that the accidentes of wyne do ſowre and waxe vinegre. But Wlpian a man of notable learnynge, is not afrayde to wrytte, in the lawe. In venditionibus de contrahenda emptione, in the pandectes, that of wine and vinegre there is (prope eadem vſia) in maner one ſubſtance, wherin he ſheweth him ſelfe, far againſt this auctors ſkil, which I put for an example to ſhewe that naturall operations haue had in naturall mennes iudgementes diuerſe conſideraciōs, one ſumtime repugnante to an other, and yet the auctors of both opinions called Philoſophers all, Amonge whiche ſum thought (for exāple) they ſpake wiſely that eſtemed all thinge to altre as ſwiftelye as the water runneth in the ſtreame, and thought therfore no man coulde vttre a worde beyng the ſame man in thende of a worde, that he was when he beganne to

ſpeake, and vſed a ſimilitude. Like as a man ſtanding in one place cannot touche the ſame one water twiſe in a runnynge ſtreame, no more can a man be touched the ſame man twiſe but he altreth as ſwiftely as doth the ſtreame. Theſe were laughed to ſkorne, yet they thought themſelfe wiſe in naturall ſpeculation. Ariſtotel (that is muche eſtemed and worthely) fanſyed a firſt matter, in all things to be one, in whiche conſideracion he ſemeth to be as extreme in a ſtaye, as the other fonde Philoſophers were in mouynge. By whiche two extremites I condempne not naturall ſpeculation, wherwith I thinke God pleaſed, for man to meruayle in cōtēplacion of his inferiour workes, and to tame his raſhe witin the inexplicable, variete of it, but to vſe it ſo, as to make it an open aduerſary to relligion, it is me ſemeth without all purpoſe. The doctrine of tranſubſtantiacion doth not teache no earthly thynge to remayne in the Sacrament, but contrary wiſe that the viſible forme of bread and wyne is there as the viſible ſygne of the Sacramente, and to be the ſame in greatnes, in thicknes, in waight, in ſauor, &amp; taſte, in propriete alſo to corrupte, putrifie, and nurriſh as it did before, and yet the ſubſtaunce of thoſe viſible creatures, to be conuerted into the ſubſtance (as Emiſſene ſayth) of the bodye of Chriſt. And here will reaſon do ſeruice to fayth to ſaye if there be

a conuerſion in deade as faith teacheth, and none of the accidentes be conuerted, then the ſubſtaunce is conuerted, for in euery thynge all is ſubſtaunce and accidentes, but the accidentes be not chaunhed, and yet a chaunge there is, it muſte nedes be then that ſubſtance is chaunged. Whiche deduction reaſon wil make and ſo agree with tranſubſtantiacion inconuenient due ſeruice. And thus I haue gotten reaſons good will, whatſoeuer this auctor ſayth, and from the grounde of faith haue by reaſon deduced ſuche a concluſion to proue tranſubſtantiacion, as onles he deſtroy the true faith of the preſence of Chriſtes very body (which he cannot,) muſt nedes be allowed. And as for naturall operacion of putrifiynge, engenbryng wor

                  es, burnyng, &amp; ſuche experiences, whiche beynge, the ſubſtance of bread abſent, this auctor thincketh cānot be ſo, when he hath thought througly, he can of his thought conclude it onely to be meruayle, and it be ſo, as againſte the comen rules of philoſophie, wherin as me ſemeth it were a nerer waye, as we be admoniſhed to leaue ſerchyng of (howe) of the worke of god in the myſterie of Chriſtes preſence, beynge that the celeſtiall parte of the Sacrament, ſo not to ſerche (howe) in thexperience of thope racion of nature, of the viſible earthely parte of the Sacrament. When God ſent Māna in deſerte, the people ſawe many meruayles in it, beſides the comē operacion of nature, and yet they neuer troubled them ſelfe with

(howes.) And as one very well Wryteth, it is conſonante that as there is a great myracle in the worke of god to make there preſent the ſubſtaunce of the bodye of Chriſt: ſo likewiſe to knowlege the myracle in the abſence of the ſubſtaunce of bread, and both the heauenly and earthely parte of the Sacrament to be myraculouſe, &amp; ſo many myracles to be ioyned together in one agreeth with the xcellencie of the Sacrament. As for thobiectiōs this auctor maketh in this matter be ſuch as he findeth in thoſe ſcolaſticall wryters, that diſcuſſe as they maye or laboure theraboute wherwith to ſatiſfie idle imaginacions, and to make learned men prompt and readye to ſay ſumwhat to theſe tryfles, whoſe argumentes this auctor taketh for his principall fondacion. For playne reſolution and auoydyng wherof, if I would nowe for my parte brynge for the there ſolutions and anſwers, there were a parte of ſcole Theologie, ſo brought into Engliſh, to no great prayſe of eyther of our lernings, but our vayne labour to ſet abrode other mens trauayles to trouble rude wittes with matter not neceſſary, &amp; by ſuch ▪vnreuerent diſputynge, and altercaciō to hynder the truth. Finally all that this auctor reherſeth of abſurditie repugneth in his eſtimacion onelye to the concluſion of philoſophie, which ſhould nothyng moue the humble ſimplicite of faith in a chriſtē mā, who merueyleth at goddes workes and reputeth

can not comprehend the wayes and meanes of them.
               As in anſvveryng to the thirde Chapittre I haue ſhewed howe reaſon receyued in to faythes ſeruice dothe not ſtriue with trāſubſtātiatiō, but agreeth well with it: ſo I truſte to ſhewe howe mannes ſences whiche this auctor calleth the fiue wittes be no ſuch directe aduerſaries to trā

The rude man I thinke would herat ſay, here is ſophiſtrie in deade, for here is ſubſtāce &amp; no ſubſtāce, matter of bread &amp; no bread, apparance of bread &amp; no bread, called bread and no bread, this is to playe iugling where it happeneth.

That ſtone whiche among many thought to haue ſume ſkil, hath been takē for a precious diamonde, hath after by cunning lapidaries, been Iudged to be but a white ſafier, &amp; contrary wiſe. So eaſlye maye our iudgement vpō the reporte of our ſences fal in error, not that the ſences be properly deceyued, but rather the man that is groſſely ſenſuall, and iudgeth fondly by thē. For the very ſubſtaunce is not the propre obiecte of any of the fiue wittes, but of their reporte cōſidered in reaſon denied, and fomtyme geſſed at, wher of enſueth great error &amp; (quid pro quo) among the potycaries and lerned alſo in thinges ſtraunge, where of they haue but accidentall markes.

I knowe no ſuche Papiſtes, but this I ſaye without further counſaile whiche this auctor with al his counſaile ſhall not auoyde.

Firſt he begynneth with Iuſtine the Martyr. Whoſe words be not truly by this authour here reported, which be theſe truely tranſlate out of the greke. When the Iuſtinꝰ. Prieaſt hath ended his thankes geuyng, and prayours, &amp; all the people hath ſayde, Amen, they whom we cal deacons geue to euery one then preſent, a parte of the breade, and of the wyne and water conſecrated, and cary parte to thoſe that be abſente, &amp; this is that foode, wh

                     •
                   after the maner, whiche Chriſt hath taught. For we do not take theſe for commen breade or dryncke, but like as Ieſus Chriſte our Sauyour incarnate by the worde of God, had fleſhe and bloud for our ſaluacion, euen ſo we be taught the fode, (wherwith our fleſhe and bloud be nourriſſhed by alteracion) when it is conſecrate by the prayour of his worde, to be the fleſh and bloude of the ſame Ieſus incarnate. For the Apoſtelles in thoſe there workes, whiche be called Goſpelles, teache that Ieſus dyd ſo commande them, and after he had taken the breade, and ended his geuyng tankes, ſayd, do this in my remembraunce, This is my body. And like wiſe takyng the cuppe after he had geuen thankes, ſayde: This is my bloud and dyd geue them to his Apoſtels onelye. And here I make an iſſue with this author, An iſſue. that he wittyngly corrupteth Iuſtine in the allegacion of him, who wryteth not in ſuch forme of wordes, as this authour allegeth owt of his ſeconde Appologie, nor hath any ſuche ſpeache, (The bread, vvater, and vvyne in this Sacrament, ar meates ordeyned purpoſely to geue thankes to God,) and therfore be called (Euchariſtia,) nor hath not theſe wordes (they be called the body and bloud

of Chriſt) but hath in playue wordes, that we be taught this foode conſecrate by gods worde, to be the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt, as Chriſt in his incarnatiō toke fleſh and bloud, nor hath not this forme of wordes placed to haue that vnderſtandyng, (hovve the ſame meate and drinke is chaunged into our fleshe and bloud,) for the wordes in Iuſtine ſpeakyng of alteracion of the fode, haue an vnderſtandyng of the fobe, as it is before the couſe cracion, ſhewyng how Chriſt vſed thoſe creatures in this myſterie, whiche by alteracion nurriſh our fleſh and bloud. For the body of Chriſt, which is the verye celeſtiall ſubſtauce of the hoſte conſecrate is not chaunged, but without al alteracion, ſpiritually nurriſheth the bodyes &amp; ſoules of them, that worthely receyue the ſame to immortalite. wherby appeareth this authors cōcluſion (that bread &amp; vvyne remayne ſtil, vvhich is turned into our flesh &amp; bloud,) is not deduced vpō Iuſtines wordes, truly vnderſtanded, but is a gloſe, inuented by this auctor &amp; a peruertyng of Iuſtines words, &amp; there true meaninges. Whervpon I may ſaye, &amp; conclude, euen as this au ctor erreth in his reaſonyng of mother wytte againſt tranſubſtātiacion, euē ſo erreth he in the firſt allegatiō of his auctorites by plaine myſceportynge, let it be further named or thought on as the thinge deſerueth.
               Next Iuſtine, is Iren in thallegatiō of whō, this auctor maketh alſo an vntrue report

who hathe not this forme of wordes in the fourth boke (contra Valētinu) that the bread wherin we geue thākes vnto God although it be of the earth, yet when the name of God is called vpon, it is not then commen bread, but the bread of thankes geuyng, hauynge two thinges in it, one earthely, and the other heauenly. This is Irene alleged by this auctor, who I ſaye wryteth not in ſuche forme of wordes. For his wordes be theſe. Like as the bread which is of the earth, receyuing the calling of God, is now no commen bread, but (Euchariſtia) conſiſtynge of two thynges, earthely, and heauenly, ſo oure bodyes receyuynge (Euchariſtia) be no more corrup

                  e. This be Irenes wordes, where Irene doth not call the bread receyuinge the callynge of God, the bread of thankes geuyng, but (Euchariſtia) and in this (Euchariſtia) he ſheweth how that, that he calleth the heauely thing, is the body and bloud of Chriſt, and therfore ſayth in his firſt booke, when the chalice mixt and the breade broken receyue the worde of God, it is made (Euchariſtia) of the body and bloud of Chriſt, of whiche the ſubſtaunce of our fleſhe is ſtayed and encreaſed. And how ſaye they that our fleſhe is not able to receyue gods gifte, who is eternal life which fleſh is nurriſhed with the body &amp; bloud of Chriſt? Theſe be alſo Irenes wordes, wherby appeareth, what he ment by the heauenly thing in (Euchariſtia,) whiche is the very preſence

of Chriſtes body &amp; bloud. And for the playne teſtimonye of this faithe, this Irene hathe been commeēy alleaged, and ſpecially of Melancton to Decolampadius, as one moſte ancient, and moſt playnely teſtifiyng the ſame. So as his very words truely alleaged, ouerthrowe this authour in the impugnation of Chriſtes reall preſence in the Sacramente, and therfore can nothyng helpe this auctors purpoſe agaynſt tranſubſtautiation. Is not this a goodly and godly entre of this author, in the firſt two auctorities that he bryngeth in, to corrupte them both? As for Drigene in Drigene his owne wordes ſaith, the matter of the breade remayneth, whiche as I haue before opened, it may be granted, but yet he termeth it not as this auctour dothe, to call in materiall breade. Whenne God formed Adam of Gene.

For the accidentes of bread maye be called the matter of breade, but not the materiall breade, as I haue ſumwhat ſpoken thereof before: but ſuche ſhiftes be vſed in this matter, notwithſtandynge the importaunce of it.
               
                  
Saincte Cypriaus wordes, do note impugne Cyprian tranſubſtantiaciō, for they tend onely to ſhewe that wyne is the creature, appoynted to the celebration of this myſterye, and therfore water onelye is no due matter accordynge to Chriſtes inſtitution. And as the name wyne muſte be vſed before the conſecration, to ſhewe the trueth of it then, ſo it maye alſo be vſed, for a name of it after, to ſhewe what it was, whiche is often vſed. And in one place of Cyprian by this author here alleaged, it appeareth Sainct Cyprian by the worde wyne, ſignifieth the heauenly wyne of the vineyarde of the Lorde of Saboth, callyng it newe wyne and alludynge therin to Dauid. And this dothe Cyprian ſhewe in theſe wordes, he we ſhall we drinke with Chriſt newe wine of the creature of the vyne, if in the ſacrifice of God the father, &amp; Chriſt we do not offer wyne? Is not here mention of newe wyne of the creature of the vyne, what newe wyne can be, but the bloud of Chriſt, the very wyne conſecrate by gods omnipotencye of the creature of the vyne offred? And therfore this one place may geue vs a leſſon in Cyprian, that as he vſeth the worde wyne to ſignifie the heauenly drinke of the bloud of Chriſt, made by conſecration of the creature of wine, So wheithe nameth the bread conſecrate bread, he meaneth the heauenly bread Chriſt, who is the bread of

life. And ſo Cyprian can make nothynge by thoſe wordes againue tranſubſtantiacion, who wryteth playnely of the chaunge of the bread by gods omnipotencye into the

               As touchyng Emiſſene by whoſe wordes Emiſſen is expreſſelye teſtified the truth of the reall preſence of Chriſt, in the Sacrament, and alſo the ſence of the doctrine of tranſubſtantiacion, this auctor maketh himſelfe bolde ouer him, and ſo bolde that he dare corrupte him, whiche Emiſſen wryteth n
                     •
                  t that man is turned in to the body of the Churche. And here I make an iſſue with this author, that Emiſſene Aniſſue. hath not that worde of turnyng in that place, and man to be turned into the body of the Church, is no conuenient ſpeache to ſignifie a change in him that is regenerate by baptiſme. He in dede that is thruſte out of the chauncell for his miſdemeanour in ſeruice tyme, maye be ſayde tourned into the bodye of the Churche. But Emiſſene ſpeaketh not ſo here, but becauſe the ſame Emiſſene declarynge the myſterye of the Sacrament, ſayth the viſible creatures be tourned into the ſubſtance of the bodye of Chriſte, thys auctour thought it woulde ſounde gaylye well, to the confuſion of that 
                     ••
                  ewe doctyne of tournynge, to ſpeake in Baptiſme

of the turnyng of a man in to the body of the Churche. And it may be comenly obſerued in this authour, whē he allegeth any auctorite of others, he bryngeth forthe the ſame in ſuche forme of wordes, as he would haue them, and not as they be, for the moſt parte or very often, and ones of purpoſe were ouer often in ſo high a matter as this is. And yet in this Emiſſins authorite afteral the payne taken to reforge him. Emiſſens doctrine play nely confoundeth this authours teachynge. This author maketh a note that there is in man baptized, nothynge chaunged outwardely, and therfore in the Sacramēt neyther, and it muſt be graunted. For the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation teacheth not in the Sacrament any outwarde chaunge. For the ſubſtance of the bread and wyne is an inwarde nature, and ſo is ſubſtance of one defined. And to ſpeake of the thyng changed, then as in man the chāge is in the ſoule, which is the ſubſtāce of man: So for the thyng chāged in the viſible creatures ſhould be alſo changed, and is chaunged, the ſubſtance of the bread and wyne to anſwere theirin to the other. And we muſt conſidre howe this compariſon of the two chaunges is made as it were by proportion. Wherin eche chaunge hath his ſpecial ende and terme, (whervnto): and therfore accordynge to terme and ende, hath his worke of chaunge, ſpeciall and ſeuerall both by gods worke. Thus I meane, The viſible

creatures hath there ende and terme whervnto the change is made, the very body and bloud of Chriſte, whiche body beynge a trut body we muſt ſaye is a corporall ſubſtance. The ſoule of man hath his ende and terme a ſpirituall alteration, incorporall, to be regenerate the ſonne of God. And then the doctrine of this Emiſſene is playne this, that eche change is of like truth, and then it foloweth that if the change of mannes ſoule in Baptiſme be true and not in a figure: The chaunge likewiſe in the Sacrament is alſo true and not in a figure. And if manues ſoule be the chunge in Baptiſme be in deade that is to ſaye, really made the ſonne of God: then is the ſubſtance of the bread, whiche is as it were the ſoule of the bread. (I am bolde here in ſpeache to vſe the worde ſoule 
                     •
                  o expreſſe proportion of the compariſon,) but euen ſo is the inwarde nature of the bread, whiche is ſubſtance, turned and chaunged in to the bodye of Chriſte, beynge the terme and ende of that chaunge. And here I ſaye ſo, not to declare the maner, but the truthe of thend, that is to ſaye, as really and in dede the chaunge is in the ſubſtaunce of bread, as in the ſoule of man, both theſe chaunges be meruelous, bothe be in the truth of there chaunge, whervnto they be chaunged of like truthe and realite, to be done in dede, they reſemble one an other in the ſecrecie of the

myſterie, and the ignoraunce of our ſences, for in neyther is any outwarde chaunge at all, and therfore there was neuer man tryppyd himſelfe more hanſomely to take a fall, then this auctour doth in this place, not onely in corruptyng euydently and notably the words of Emiſſene with ow

                  iſme, to be there made the ſonne of God, is but in figure and ſignification, not true and reall in dede, or els graunte the true Cathelique doctrine of the turne of the viſible creatures in to the bodye and bloude, of Chriſt, to be likewiſe not in figure and ſignificatiō, but truly, really, and in dede. And for the thyng chaunged, as the ſoule of man in mannes inwarde nature is chaunged: ſo the inwarde nature of the bread is changed. And then is that euaſion taken awaye, whiche this authour vſeth in an other place of Sacramentall chaunge, whiche ſhould be in the outwarde parte of the viſible creatures to the vſe of ſignification. This author noteth thage of Emiſſen, and I note with all howe playnely he writeth for confirmation of the Catholique teachynge, who in dede becauſe of his auncientie and playne writynge for declaraciō of the matter in forme of teachyng

with owt contētion, is one, whoſe authorite the churche hath much in allegation vſed to the conuiction of ſuch as haue impugned the Sacrament eyther in truthe of the preſence of Chriſtes very body, or tranſubſtantiation, for the ſpeakynge of the inwarde chaunge, doth poynte as it were the change of the ſubſtaunce of bread, with reſemblyng thervnto the ſoule of man changed in Baptiſme. This one authour not beynge of any reproued and of ſo many approued, and by this in thallegacion, after this maner corrupte, might ſuffice for to conclude all brablyng agaynſte the ſacrament. But I wil examē mo particularities. I haue before anſwered to Hilarie, to Hilarie. whom neuertheles I ſhould aptely haue ſaid ſumwhat nowe to note, howe he diſtincteth owtwardly &amp; inwardly by beleue &amp; corporal ſight. For owtwardly as Emiſſene ſaieth we 
                     •
                  e no chaunge, and therfore we ſee after conſecration as before, whiche we may therfore call bread, but we beleue that inwardly is, whiche as Emiſſene ſaieth is the ſubſtance of the bodye of Chriſte, whervnto the chaunge is made of the inwarde nature of bread as by the compariſon of Emiſſen doth appeare.

                   of the

Sacrament, doth neceſſaryly implye beary true preſence of Chriſtes bodye auctor or life. And then as often as the authour is ouer throune in the truth of the preſence, ſo often is he (by zuinglius rule) ouerthrowen in trā
                  ſubſtanciation. As for the name of bread is graunted becauſe it was ſo, and tranſubſtantiation doth not take awaye, but it is meate becauſe of the viſible matter remaynynge. This ſayinges be ſought owt by this authour, onely to wrangle, not taken owt, where the myſterie is declared and preached to be taught as a doctrine thereof, but onely ſignified by the waye and ſpoken of vpon occaſion, the ſence wherof faythfull men knowe otherwiſe then appeareth, at the firſt readynges to the carnall man, but by ſuche like ſpeaches the Arrians impugned the diuinite of Chriſt.
               Chriſoſtome ſpeaketh in this place of Chriſoſtome. wyne, as Cyprian dyd before, againſt thoſe that offre no wyne but water. Chriſoſtome ſaiethe thus, Chriſt vſed wyne, &amp; I graunte he did ſo, For he dyd cōſecrate that creature &amp; as Emiſſene ſayth, turned it in the celebration &amp; diſpenſation of theſe myſteries. But this ſayng towcheth nothing the doctrine of trāſubſtantiatiō. The ſecond ſaying of Chriſoſtome which I neuer red, but in Peter martyrs booke, who ſaieth it is not printed, this ſentence toucheh this auctours doctrine muche,

If the breade by conſecration, be deliuered from the name of breade, &amp; exalted to the name of our lordes body. Nowe conſider reader, if this maner of ſpeache by Chriſoſtome here meaneth an effectual namynge, to make the ſubſtaunce of the body of Chriſt preſent, as Chriſoſtome in his publique approued workes is vnderſtāded of all to teache, then is the deliueraunce from the name of breade, of like effecte, to take a waye the reaſon of the name of bread, whiche is the chaunge in ſubſtaunce therof. Or if this auctor will ſay that by the name of breade, Chriſoſtome vnderſtādeth the bare name, howe can that ſtā
                  de without reprouſe of ſainct Paule? who after this authours mynde calleth it bread after conſecration, and ſo do many other by this authour alleged, here percace may be ſaide what ſhuld I reaſon what he ment, when he ſaieth playnely the nature of bread ſtill remayneth. To this I ſaie that as Chriſoſtome in this place (of an epiſtell not publiſhed by credite) ſaith that the nature of breade remayneth, ſo Cyprian that was older then he, ſaieth the nature of bread is chaunged, which Chriſoſtome in his other workes, by publique credite ſet a brode, ſemeth not to denye. Nowe the worde (nature) ſignifieth both the ſubſtaunce, and alſo propriete of the nature. The ſubſtaunce therfore after Cypriā by the worde of god is chaunged, but yet the proper

effecte is not chaunged, but in th accidentes remayne with out illuſion by whiche diuers ſignification &amp; acception of the worde nature both the ſayinges of S. Cyprian and Sainct Chriſoſtome (if this be his ſaying) may be accorded, and not with ſtandynge the contrariete in lettre, agre neuertheleſſe in ſence by twene themſelfe and agree with the true doctrine of tranſubſtantiacion. Adde to this howe the wordes of Chriſoſtome next folowyng this ſentence, alleged by this auctor, and as it ſemeth of purpoſe lefte here owt, doth both confounde this authors enterpriſe and cōfirme the true doctrine whiche wordes be theſe, (and is not called two bodyes but one bodye of the ſonne of God) of Chriſoſtome I ſhall ſpeake againe herafter.
               Sainct Ambroſe doth not (as this author Ambroſius. would haue it) impugne tranſubſtantiacion, but confirmeth it moſt playnely? becauſe he teacheth the true preſēce of Chriſtes body in the Sacramēt, whiche he ſayth is by change and thynges ſtill remayning, and that maye be verified in the owtwarde viſible matter, that is to ſay, the accidētes remayning with there propre effectes whiche therfore maye worthly be called thinges. And here I wold aſke this authour, if his teachyng as he pretēdeth wer the catholique fayth, &amp; the bread onely ſignified Chriſtes bodye, what ſhould neade this force of gods worde, that S. Ambroſe ſpeaketh of, to brynge in the creatiō of the worlde, wherby to induce mannes fayth

in this myſtery to the belife of it? As for th example Baptiſme to ſhewe the chaunge in mannes ſoule, wherof I haue ſpoken, declaryng Emiſſene, ſerueth for an induction not toleaue to our owtward ſēces, ne to miſtruſt the great miracle of God in eyther, becauſe we ſee none outwarde experiēce of it, but els it is not neceſſarie the reſemblance ſhall anſwere in qualitie, otherwiſe then as I ſaide afore, eche parte anſweryng his conuenient proportion, and as for there compariſon of reſemblaunce Baptiſme with the Sacrament, this auctour in his doctrine ſpecially reproueth, in that he can not I thynke denye, but man by regeneration of his ſowle in Baptiſme, is the partaker of holines, but as for the bread, he ſpecially admoniſheth it is not par taker of holynes by this conſecracion, but howe ſoeuer this auctor in his owne doctrine ſnarleth himſelfe, the doctrine of S. Ambroſe is playne, that before the conſecration it is bread, and after the cōſecration, the body of Chriſt, whiche is an vndowbted affirmacion then to be no bread, howe ſo euer the accidentes of bread do remayne.
               In the. 26. leef this auctor bryngeth forth two ſayinges of S. Auguſtine, which whau Auguſtinus. this auctor wrot, it is lik he neither thought of the thirde or firſt booke of this worke, For theſe two ſayinges declare moſte euidently, the reall preſence of Chriſtes body and bloud in the ſacramēt, affirmyng the ſame to be the

ſacrifice of the Churche, wherby apperith it is no figure onely. In the firſt ſayinge of S. Auguſtine is written thus, howe fayth ſhewith me that brede is the body of Chriſt, nowe what ſoeuer faithe ſhewith is a truth, and then it foloweth that of a truth it is the body of Chriſt whiche ſpeache breade is the body of Chriſt is as muche to ſay, as it is made the body of Chriſt, and made not as of a matter, but as Emiſſen wrote by conuerſion of the viſible creature in to the ſubſtaunce of the body of Chriſt, and as S Auſten in the ſame ſentence writeth it is bread before the conſecration, and after the fleſhe of Chriſt, As for the ſeconde ſayinge of ſaincte Auſten, howe could it with more playne wordes be wryten, then to ſaye that there is bothe the Sacramēt and the thinge of the Sacramēt, whiche is Chriſts body calling the ſame ſacrifice of the Churche. Nowe if Chriſt is body be there, it is trulither &amp; ī dede ther which is real Marke 
                        〈◊〉
                      reader. If ther, as for there in a figure wer to ſay not there in truth, and in dede, but onely ſignified to be abſēt which is the nature a of figure in his propre and ſpeciall ſpeache. But ſainct Auſten ſaith euen as the auctour bringeth hiforth, &amp; yet he haue his priuy nyppe by the waye thus, It is ſaide of S. Auguſtine, there be two thinges in this ſacrifice, whiche be conteyued in it, wherof it cōſiſteth ſo as the body of Chriſt is conteyued in this ſacrifice by S. Auguſtines mynde, According wherunto

ſainct Auguſtine is alleged to ſaye in the ſame booke from whēs the auctour tooke this ſaynge. Alſo theſe wordes followynge, vnder the kindes of bread and wyne whiche we ſee, we honour thīges inuiſible that, is to ſaye the fleſſhe and bloud of Chriſt, nor we do not likewiſe eſteme theſe two kindes as we did bifore the conſecration, for we muſte faithefully confeſſe before the conſecracion to be bread and wyne that nature formed and after conſecracion the fleſhe and bloud of Chriſt which the benediction hath cōſecrate Thus ſaith ſainct Auguſtine as he is alleged owt of that booke, which in dede I haue not, but he hath the like ſēce in other places, and for honoringe of the inuiſible heauenly thinges there, which declare the true and real preſence, ſainct Auguſtine hathe like in his booke (de Cathechiſandis rudibus) and in the 98. pſalme, where he ſpeaketh of adoration. This may be notable to the reader howe this author concludeth him ſelfe in the real preſē

And nowelet this auctor choſe whether he will ſaie any of the natures, the manhod, or the godhode were but figuratiuely in Chriſt, whiche and he do, then may he the better ſa

                  e for the agrement of this doctrine the nature of the body &amp; the bloud of Chriſt is but figuratiuely in the Sacramēt. And if he ſaie (as he muſte nedes ſaie) that the two natures be in Chriſtes perſon really, naturally, ſubſtantially, then muſt he graunt by his owne collectiō, the truth of the beyng of the nature of the body and bloud of chriſt to be like wiſe in the ſacramēt, &amp; therby call backe all that he hath writtē againſt the real preſēce of Chriſtes body in the ſacramēt, and abandon his diuiſe of a preſence by ſignification, which is in truth a playne abſence, as himſelfe ſpekith alſo openly, which open ſpeche cānot ſtande, and is improued by this opē ſpech of his owne likewiſe, wher he ſaith the nature of the body and bloud of Chriſt remayne in the ſacrament, the worde (remaine) being of ſuch ſignification, as it betokenith not onely to be there, but to cary there and ſo there is declared the ſacrifice of the Churche, whiche miſterie of ſacrifice is perfited before the perceptiō, &amp; ſo it muſt be euidēt howe the body of Chriſt is ther, that is to ſaie on thal

                   this myſtery, as their were diuerſe more in māna

the figure of it. And then a myracle in gods workinge doth not empayre the truth of the worke. And therfore I noted before, howe ſaincte Thomas did towche Chriſt, after his reſurrection truely, and yet it was by myracle, as ſaincte Grigorie writeth. And further we may ſaye towching the compariſon that when a reſemblaunce is made, of the Sacrament to Chriſtes perſon, or contrarywiſe of Chriſtes perſon to declare the Sacrament, we may not preſſe all partes of the reſemblance, with a through equalitie in conſideracion of eche parte by it ſelfe, but onely haue reſpecte to thende, wherfore the reſemblaunce is made. In the perſone of Chriſte be ioyned two holl perfite natures inſeperably vnite, which faith the neſtorians impugned, and yet vnite witout confuſiō of them, which confuſion Theutichians in conſequēce of their of error affirmed, and ſo argumētes be brought the Sacrament, wher with to conuince both as I ſhall ſhewe anſweringe to Gelaſius. But in this place ſaincte Auguſtine vſeth the truth moſt certaine of the two natures in Chriſtes perſon, wherby to declare his beliefe in the Sacrament, whiche beliefe as Hylarie before is by this auctor alleaged to ſaye, is of that is inwardly, For that is owtowardly of the viſible creature, we ſee (he hath) with our bodelye eye and therfore therin is no poynte of faith, that ſhulde nede ſuche a declaracion, as S. Auguſtine makith.

And yet making the compariſon, he reherſeth both the truthes on both ſides ſayng. As the perſō of Chriſt cōſiſteth of God and man, ſo the ſacrifice of the Church cōſiſteth of two thinges, the viſible kinde of the elemente, and the inuiſible fleſhe and bloud, finiſhing the concluſion of the ſimilitude, that therfore their is in the ſacrifice of the Churche, both the Sacrament and the thyng of the Sacrament, Chriſtes body, That is whiche is inuiuiſible and therfore required declaraciō, that is by S. Auguſtine opened in the compariſon that is to ſay the body of Chriſt to be there truely, and their with that neded no declaratiō that is to ſaye the viſible kinde of the element is ſpoken of alſo as being true, but not as a thing which was entended to be proued, for it neded not any prouf as the other parte did, and therfore it is not neceſſary to preſſe both partes of the reſemblaunce ſo, as becauſe in the nature of Chriſtes humanite thier was no ſubſtaunce conuerted in Chriſt, whiche had been contrary to thordre of that myſterye, which was to yoyne the holl nature of mane to the godhed in the perſon of Chriſt, that therfore in this myſtery of the Sacrament, in the whiche by the rule of our faithe Chriſtes, body is not impanate, the cō
                  uerſion of the ſubſtaunce of the viſible elemē
                  tes ſhuld not therfore be. If truth anſwerith to truth for the proportiō of the truthe in the myſterie that is ſufficiēte. For elles the natures

be not ſo vnite in one hipoſtaſic in the myſterie of the ſacramēte as they be in Chriſtes perſon, &amp; the fleſhe of mā in Chriſt by vniō of the diuinitie, is a diuine ſpirituall fleſhe, &amp; is called &amp; is a liuely fleſhe, and yet thauctor of this booke, is not afrayde to teache the breade in the ſacramēt to haue no participatiō of holynes, wherin I agree not with him, but reaſon aganiſte him with his owne doctrine, and much I could ſaye more, but this ſhal ſuffiſe. The wordes of S. Auguſtine for the reall preſence of Chriſtes body be ſuche as no mane cā wreſte, or writh to an other ſēſe, &amp; with their force haue made this auctor ouerthrowe him ſelfe in his owne wordes. But that S. Auguſtine ſaith towching the nature of breade and the viſible elemēte of the ſacrament wih out wreſting or writhing may be agreed in cōueniēr vnderſtāding with the doctrine of trāſubſtātiation, &amp; therfore is an authoritie familier with thoſe writers that affirme trāſubſtanciatiō by expreſſe wordes, owt of whoſe qui ner this authour hath pulled owt this bolt, &amp; as it is owt of his boweſēte, turneth bake &amp; hitteth himſelfe on the forhed, &amp; yet after his faſhion by wronge &amp; vntrue trāſlatiō he ſharpened it ſomewhat, not with out ſū puniſſhemēt of god euidētly by the waye by his owne wordes to ouerthrowe himſelfe. In the ſecōde colūne of the 27 leaf, &amp; the firſte of the 28 leaf, this auctour maketh a proceſſe in declaration of heriſes in the perſon of Chriſt, for cōuictiō wherof this authr ſaith the olde fathers vſed

argumēts of two exāples, in eyther of which exāples were two natures to gyther, the one not periſhing nor cōfounding the other. One exāple is in the body &amp; ſoule of man. An other exāple of the ſacramēt in which be two natures, as inowarde heuenly, &amp; an owtwarde earthly, as in man their is a body &amp; a ſoule. I leaue owt this auctours owne iudgement in that place &amp; of the (o reader) require thyne, whither thoſe fathers that did vſe both theſe exāples to the cōfuſiō of heretiques, did not belief as apperith by the proceſſe of theire reaſoning in this poynte, did they not I ſay hele ne that, euen as really &amp; as truly, as the ſoule of mā is preſēt in the bodye, ſo really &amp; ſo truely is the body of chriſt) which in the ſacramēt is the inward inuiſible thing as the ſoule is in the body, preſēt in the ſacramēt, for elles &amp; the body of Chriſt were not as truly &amp; really preſent in the ſacramēt, as the ſoule is in mānes body, that argumēt of the ſacrament had no two thinges preſēt ſo as thargumēt of the body &amp; ſoule had, wherby to ſhewe howe two things may be to gether witout cōfuſiō of eyther, eche remayning in his nature, for if the teaching of this auctour in other partes of this booke wer true, thē were the ſacramēt like a body lyinge in a traunſe, whoſe ſoule for the while were in heuē &amp; had no two thinges but one bare thinge, that is to ſaie, breade, &amp; breade neuer the holyer with ſignificatiō of an other thig ſo far abſēt, as is heuē frō earth, &amp; therfor to ſay as I ꝓblabli thinke, this part of

this ſecōde booke againſt tranſubſtantiacion was a collection of this auctour whē he mynded to mayntaine luthers opiniō againſt trā ſubſtāciaciō onely, and to ſtriue for bread onely, which not with ſtonding the newe enterpriſe of this authour to denye the reall preſē
                  ce, is ſo ferce &amp; vehement, as it ouerthroueth his newe purpoſe, or he cumith in his ordre in his booke to entreat of it. For there can no demonſtracion be made more euidente, for the catholique faith of the real preſēce of Chriſts body in the Sacramēt, then that the truth of it was ſo certaynly byleued, as they toke Chriſtes very body as verely in the ſacramēt, euen as the ſoule is preſent in the body of mā.
               S. Chriſoſtomes wordes in deade, if this Chriſoſtomus. auctour had had them eyther truly tranſlate unto him, or had taken the paynes to haue truly trāſlate them himſelfe whiche as peter martyrſaieth be not in printe, but were founde in florence, a copy wherof remayneth in tharche deacon or Archebiſſhoh of Caunterburies handes or els if this authour had reaported the wordes as they be ttanſlate in to engliſhe owt of peter martyrs booke, wherin in ſum pointe the tranſlator in Engliſhe, ſemeth to haue attayned by geſſe the ſēſe more perfitely, thē peter martyr vttereth it hiſelf. if eyther of this had beē, done the mater ſhuld haue ſemed for ſomuch the more playne. But what is this to make foundacion of an argumēte vpō a ſecrete copye of an epiſtell vttred

at one tyme ī diuerſe ſēſes? I ſhall to wch one ſpeciall point, peter martyr ſaith in latē, whō the tranſlator in engliſhe therin followeth, that the bread is reputed, worthy the name of the lordes body. This authour engliſhyng the ſame place turnith it (exalted to the name of the lordes body) which wordes of exalting cum nerer to the purpoſe of this auctour to haue the bread but a figure &amp; ther with neuer the holyer of it ſelfe. But a figure cāne neuer be accompted worthy the name of our lordes body, the very thing of the Sacramente, onles there were the thing in dede, as there is by cōuerſion, as the Church truely teacheth. Is not here reader a meruelouſe diuerſitie in reporte, and the ſame ſo ſetforth as thowe that canneſt but reade engliſhe maiſte euidētly ſee it, God ordringe it ſo as ſuch varieties and contradictions ſhuld ſo manyfeſtely appeare where the truth is impugned? Againe this auctor makith Chriſoſtome to ſpeake ſtrāgely in thende of this auctoritie, that the diuine nature reſtith in the body of Chriſt, as thowgh the nature of man were the ſtaye to the diuine nature, wheir as in that vnion the reſt is an ineffable myſterie, the two natures in Chriſt to haue one ſubſiſtence called &amp; termed an hypoſtaſie, &amp; therfore he that hath tranſlate peter martyr in to engliſhe doth trāſlate it thus. The diuine cōſtitutiō the nature of the body adyoyned, thieſe two both to gyther, make one ſonne and one perſon.
               
                  
Thow reader maiſte compare the bookes that be a brode of Peter martyr in laten, peter martyr in engliſhe and this auctours booke, with that I write and ſo deme whither I ſaye true or no. But to the purpoſe of ſainct Chriſoſtomes wordes (if they be his wordes) he directeth his argument to ſhewe by the my ſterie of the Sacramēt, that as that as in it, there is no confu
                     •
                  ion of natures, but eche remayneth in his proprietie. So likewiſe in Chriſt the nature of his hodheade doth not confounde the nature of his manhode, If the viſible creatures were in the Sacrament by the preſence of Chriſtes body the r
                     •
                   truly preſent, beinge inuiſible alſo as that body is impalpable alſo as that is, incorruptiptible alſo as that is, then were the viſiviſible nature altred, and as it were confounded, whiche Chriſoſtom ſaieth is not ſo, for the nature of the bread remayneth, by which worde of nature is, conueniently ſignified the propriete of nature. For prouf wherof, to ſhewe remayninge of the proprietie with out alteracion, Chriſoſtom maketh onely the reſemblance, and before I haue ſhewed howe nature ſignifieth the proprietie of nature, and may ſignifie the owtward part of nature that is to ſay, thaccidētes beyng ſubſtaunce in his propre ſignificatiō, the inward nature of the thing of the conuerſion wherof, is ſpecially vnderſtanded tranſubſtantiation.
               Nowe foloweth to anſwere to Belaſius,

who abhorrynge bothe the heriſes of Eutiches, Gelaſius and Neſtorius in his treatiſe, againſte the Eutichiās forgetteth not to cōpare with there errour in extremitie one the one ſide, thextreme errour of the Neſtorians one the other ſide, but it principally entendeth the confuſion of the Eutichians with whome he was ſpecially troubled. Theſe two heriſes, were not ſo groſſe as thauctour of this boke reporteth them, wherin I will writte what Uigilius ſaith. (Inter Neſtorii ergo quondā Eccleſiae Conſtantinopolitanae non rectoris,

Theſe be vigilius wordes, in his firſt booke, whiche be thuſ much in Engliſhe. Betwene thabominable teaching of Neſtorius, ſumtyme not ruler but waſter, not paſt ōr, but pray ſercher of the church of cōſtātinople, &amp; the wicked &amp; deteſtable ſecte of Eutiches, the crafte of the deuels ſpoyling ſo facioned it ſelf, that mē could not auoyde any of the ſectes without daūger of thother. So as whiles any mā rdēpneth the falſenes of the neſtoriā, he maye be though

fallen to the errour of the Eutichian, and whiles he diſtroyeth the wickedneſſe of the eutichianes heriſie he may be chalēged to realeue the teachinge of the Neſtorian. This is the ſentēce of vigilius, By whiche appereth howe theſe heriſies were both ſubtely conueyed, without ſo playne contradiction as this auctor either by ignoraunce or of purpoſe fayneth, aſhthowh the neſtoriā ſhould ſaye, Chriſt was a perfit man, but not God, and the Eutichian clene contrary very God, but not man. For if the heriſies had bene ſuche, vigilius had had no cauſe to ſpeake of any ſuche ambiguitie as he notith that a mā ſhoulde hardely ſpeake againſte the one, but he might be ſuſpected to fauour the other. And yet I graunte that the Neſtorians ſayinges might implie chriſt not to be God, becauſe they wolde two diſtincte different natures to make alſo two diſtincte perſons, and ſo as it were two Chriſtes, the one onely man, and the other onely God, ſo as by there teachinge God was neither incarnate, nor as Gregorie Nazianzene ſaith mā deitate, for ſo he is termed to ſaye. The Eutichians as Sainct Auguſtine ſaith reaſoninge againſt the Neſtoriaus, becam heritiques themſelfe, and becauſe we cōfeſſe truly by faith but one Chriſt the ſonne of God very God, The Eutichians ſaye, although there were in the virgins wombe before thadunation two natures, yet after thadunation,

in that myſtery of Chriſtes incarnacion there is but one nature, and that to be the nature of God, into which the nature of mā was after there fanſye tranſfuſed &amp; ſo confounded, whervppon by implication a man might gather the nature of the humanitie not to remayne in Chriſt after the adunation in the virgines wombe. Gelaſius deteſtinge both Eutiches and Neſtorius in his proceſſe vtterith a catholique meaninge againſt thē both, but he directith ſpeciall argumentes of the two natures in man, and of the two natures in the ſacrament, chefely againſte the Eutichians to proue the nature of man to continue in Chriſt after the adunatiō, being no abſurditie for two different natures to cō
                  ſtitute one, the ſame remayning two in ther proprietie, and the natures to be (aliud,) and (aliud,) whiche ſignifieth different, and yet in that not to be (alius,) and, (alius) in perſon whiche the Eutichians abhorred, and catholiquely, for ſo much againſt the Neſtorians, who by reaſon of two natures wolde haue two perſons, and becauſe thoſe Neſtorians fanſied the perſon of Chriſt patible to ſuffer all aparte: therfore they denyed Chriſt conceyued God or borne God, for thabolitiō of which parte of there heriſie, and to ſet forth the vnitie of Chriſtes perſon, The bleſſed virgin was callid deipara (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ,) godes mother, whiche the Neſtorians deluded, by an expoſition, grauntinge ſhe might ſo be callid

becauſe her ſonne they ſayd was afterward God, and ſo ſhe might be called goddes mother, as an other woman may be called a biſſhopps mother, if her ſonne be made a biſſhoppe afterward although he departed no biſhoppe from here.
               And hereof I writte thuſmuche, becauſe it ſhoulde appeare that Gelaſius by his argumentes of the ſacrament, and of the two natures in man wente not aboute to proue that the godhed remayned in Chriſt after his incarnacion, as thauctour of this booke wolde haue it, for the Neſtorian ſayde the godhed was an acceſſion to Chriſt afterward by merite, and therfore with thē there was no talke of remaynynge, when they eſtemed Chriſtes nature in his conception ſinguler, and onely by goddes power conceyued, but onely man. And again theutichiane ſo affirmed the cōtinuaunce of the diuine nature in Chriſt after the adunation, as Gelaſius had no cauſe to proue that was graunted, that is to ſaye, the remayne of the diuine nature, but one the other ſide to proue the remayne of the humaine nature in chriſt, whiche by the Eutichians, was by implicacion rather denyed. Neſtorius deuided God and man, and graunted alwayes bothe to be in Chriſt continually, but as two perſons, and the perſon of Chriſt beynge God dwellynge within the perſon of Chriſte beynge man, and as Chriſt man encreaſed, ſo Chriſt

God dignified him and ſo diuided one Chriſt in twoperſons, becauſe of the two natures ſo different, whiche was againſte the rules of oure faith and diſtroyed thereby the miſterie of oure redemption. And the Eutithians affirmynge catholiquely to be but one perſon in Chriſte, did perniciouſly ſaye ther was therfore but one nature in Chriſt, accomptynge by implication the humaine nature tranſfuſed in to the diuine nature and ſo confounded. And to ſhewe the narrowe paſſage vigilius ſpeake of, Cyrillus a catholique auctour, becauſe writynge of the vnitie of Chriſtes perſonne, he expreſſed his meanynge by the worde (nature) ſignifyinge the holl of any one conſtitution, whiche more properly the worde perſone doth expreſſe. Theutichians wolde by, that worde after gather that he fauoured there parte, ſo takynge the worde at a vauntage.
               And becauſe the ſame Cyrillus, vſed the worde ſubſiſtence to ſignifie ſubſtaunce, and therfore ſayde in Chriſte there were two ſubſiſtences, meanynge the diuine ſubſtaunce and humane ſubſtaunce, foraſmuche as the worde ſubſiſtence is vſed to expreſſe the perſonne that is to ſaye hypoſtaſie: There were that of that worde f
                     •
                  owardely vnderſtanded wolde gather he ſhoulde ſaye, that there were two perſonnes

in Chriſt, whiche was the neſtoriās heriſie that he impugned, Suche captiouſneſſe was there in wordes, when arrogant men cared not by what meane to maintayne there errour, theſe were both pernitious heriſes, and yet ſubtill and eche had a maruaylous pretence of the defence of the glorie of God, euen as is nowe pretended againſte the ſacrament. And either parte abuſed many ſcriptures, and had notable apparaunces for that they ſayde, ſo as he that were not well exerciſed in ſcriptures, and the rules of oure faith might be eaſely circumuented. Neſtorius was the great Archibiſhoppe of Conſtantinoble, vnto whom cyrill that condempnith his heriſie, writeth that ſeyng he ſclaū
                  derith the holl Churche with his heriſie, he muſt reſiſte him although he be a father, bycauſe Chriſt ſaith, he that louith his father Mat. 10. aboue me, is not worthy me. But Neſtorius as appeareth althowgh he vſed it ilfauerdly had muche learnynge and cloked his heriſie craftely, denying the groſſe matter that they imputed to him to teache two Chriſtes, and other ſpecialities layde to his charge, and yet condempnynge the doctrine of Cyrill, &amp; profeſſyng his owne faith in his owne termes, coulde not hide his heriſie ſo, but it appereth to be and conteyne in effecte that he was charged with, and therfore an admoniſhment was geuen by a catholique writer. Beleue not Neſtorius thowgh he ſaye

he teache but one Chriſt. If one ſhould here aſke what is this to the purpoſe to talke ſo muche of theſe ſectes, I Anſwer, this knowledge ſhall generallye ſerue, to note the maner of them that goo a boute to deceyue the worlde with falſe doctrine, whiche is good to learne: An other ſpeciall ſeruice, is to declare howe the auctour of this booke, eyther doth not knowe the ſtate of the matter in theſe heriſes he ſpeaketh of, or elles miſreporteth them of purpoſe. And the arguynge of Gelaſius in this matter wel opened, ſhall geue light of the truth of the myſterie of the Sacrament. Who againſt the Eutichians vſeth two argumentes of examples, one of the two different natures to remayne in one perſon of man, and yet, the Eutichians diffamed that coniunction, with remayning of two different natures, and called it 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , double nature, and Gelaſius to encontre that terme ſayth, they will with there 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   one nature reſerue not one Chriſt and hole Chriſt. And if two differēt natures, that is to ſaye ſoule and body make but one man, why not ſo in Chriſt? For where ſcripture ſpeaketh of the outwarde man and inwarde man, that is to ſhewe (Gelaſius ſaith) two diuerſe qualities in the ſame man, and not to deuide the ſame man into two men, and ſo intēdeth to ſhewe there owght to be no ſcruple to graunte two differente natures to remayne in there propriete, for feare that euery

diuerſe nature ſhould make a diuerſe perſon, and ſo in Chriſt deuide the vnitie, concluding that the integritie of Chriſte cannot be but both the natures different remayning in ther propertie. Carual imagination troubled the Eutichians, to haue one perſon of two ſuche differēt natures remayning in ther properte, which the Neſtorians releued with deuiſe of two perſons, and the Eutichians by confuſion of the humaine nature. Then cummeth Gelaſius, to the argument of example from the Sacrament of the bodye and bloude of Chriſt, and noteth the perſon of Chriſt to be a principall myſterye, and the Sacrament an image and ſimilitude of that myſterye, which ſence his wordes muſte nedes haue, becauſe he calleth Chriſte the principall myſterye, and as in one place he ſayth the image and ſimilitude of the bodye and bloud of Chriſte, ſo by and by he calleth the Sacramente the image of Chriſte. And here, the wordes image and ſimilitude, expreſſe the maner of preſence of the truth of the thinges repreſented, to be, vnderſtanded onely by faith, as inuiſibly preſent. And Saincte Ambroſe by this worde mage, ſignifieth thexhibition of truth to man in this life. And to ſhewe the Sacrament to be ſuche an image, as conteyneth the verye truthe of the thinge, whereof it is the image. Gelaſius declareth in framynge his argumente in theſe wordes. As breade and

wyne go into the diuine ſubſtaunce the holy gooſte bringyng it to paſſe, and yet remayne in the proprietie of there nature, ſo that principall myſterye, thoſe natures remayninge, whereof it is declared vnto vs true and hole Chriſt to continue. In theſe wordes of Gelaſius where he ſaith the breade and wyne go into the diuine ſubſtaunce, is playnely declared the preſence of the diuine ſubſtaunce, and this diuine ſubſtaunce, can ſignifie none other ſubſtaunce, but of the body and bloude of Chriſte, of whiche heauenly nature, and earthely nature of the breade and wyne, conſiſteth this Sacrament the image of the principall myſterye of Chriſtes perſon. And therfore as in the image be two diuers natures and different remayninge in there proprietie. So likewiſe in the perſon of Chriſt, whiche is the concluſion of Gelaſius argumente, ſhould remayne two natures. And here were a greate daunger, if we ſhoulde ſaye that Chriſtes body, whiche is the celeſtiall nature in the Sacramente, were there preſent but in a figure, for it ſhoulde then implye, that in Chriſtes perſonne the principall myſterye, it were alſo but in a figure. And therfore as in the myſterye of Chriſtes perſonne, ordened to redeme vs, beynge the principal miſtery there is no figure, but truth in conſideracion of the preſens of the two natures, wherof Chriſt is: So in the Sacramēt beyng a miſterye ordred to feade vs, &amp; the image

of that principal miſtery, ther is not an onely figure, but truth of the preſens of the natures earthely &amp; celeſtiall. I ſpeake of the truth of preſence, and meane ſuche an integritie of the natures preſent, as by the rules of our faith, is conſonante and agreable to that miſtery, that is to ſay, in the perſon of Chriſt perfit God &amp; perfit mā, perfite God to be incarnate, &amp; perfit man to be deitate, as Gregory Nazianzene termeth it. In the Sacramēt, the viſible matter of the earthely creature in his proprietie of nature, for the vſe of ſignificaciō is neceſſariely required, &amp; alſo according to the truth of Chriſt his wordes, his very body, &amp; bloud, to be inuiſibly with integrite preſent, which Gelaſius calleth the diuine ſubſtaunce. And I thinke it worthy to be noted, that Gelaſius ſpeking of the bread &amp; wyne, reciteth not preciſely the ſubſtāce to remaine, but ſaith the ſubſtāce, or nature, which nature he calleth after proprietie, &amp; the diſiūctiue may be verified in the laſt, &amp; it is not neceſſary, thexāples to be in al partes equal, as ruſticus diacom
                     •
                  s handleth it very lernedly cōtra Acephalos. And Gelaſius in opening the myſtery of the Sacrament,, ſpeaketh of trāſitiō of the bread, &amp; wyne into the godly ſubſtāce, whiche worde tranſition, is mete to expreſſe tranſubſtantiaciō, &amp; therfore S. Thomas expreſſed trāſubſtantiaciō with the ſame word

tranſire, writyng. (Dogma datur Chriſtianis quod in carnē trāſit panis &amp; vinū in ſanguinē.) But in the myſterie of Chriſtes perſon, there is no trāſition of the deitie into the humanite, or humanite into the deitie, but onely aſſumption of the humanite with adunaciō of thoſe two natures, &amp; of two perfit natures ſo differēt one perſon &amp; one Chriſt, who is God incarnate, &amp; man deitate, as Gregory Nazianzene ſaith, withoutmutation, cōuetſion, trauſitiō, tranſelementation, or tranſubſtantiation, whiche wordes be propre, &amp; ſpecial to expreſſe, howe (Euchariſtia) is cōſtitute of two diſtrēt natures, an heauenly, &amp; earthly nature, a myſtery inſtitute after the exāple of the principal myſterie, wherwith to feade vs with the ſubſtāce of the ſame glorious body that hath redemed vs. And becauſe in the cōſtitution of this myſterie of the ſacramēt, there is a trāſitiō of the earthly creature into the diuine ſubſtāce, as Gelaſius, &amp; S. Thomas terme it, &amp; mutacion as Cyprian, &amp; Ambroſe teache it, which Theophilactus expreſſeth by the worde trāſelemētacion, Emiſſen by the conuerſion, &amp; all theſe wordes reduced into there one propre ſence expreſſed in one worde of tranſubſtantiacion: it cannot be cōuenient where the maner of the conſtitution of two myſteries be ſo different, there to require a like remayning of the two natures, whereof the myſteryes be,

In the myſterye of Chriſtes perſon, becauſe there was not of any of the two different natures eythex mutation, tranſition, conuerſiō, or trauſelementation, but onely aſſumption of the humanitie, and adunation in the virgyns wombe, we cannot ſay the godhed, to haue ſuffred in that myſterye, which were an abſurditie, but to haue wrought the aſſumption, and adunation of mans nature with it, nor mans nature by that aſſumption, and adunation diminiſhed, and therfore profeſſe truly Chriſt to be hole God and whole man, and God in that myſterye, to be made man, and man God, where as in the Sacrament, becauſe of tranſition, mutation, and conuerſion of there earthely creatures, wrought by the holy gooſt, which declareth thoſe earthly creatures to ſuffer in this conuerſion, mutation, and tranſition, we knowledge no aſſumption of thoſe creatures, or adunation with the heauthly nature, and therfore, ſaye not, as we do, in the principal myſterye, that eche nature is holly the other, and as we profeſſe God incarnate, ſo the bodye of Chriſte breaded, and as man is deitate, ſo the bread is corporate: whiche we ſhould ſay, if the rules of our fayth could permitte, the conſtitution of eche myſterye to be taught a lyke, which the truth of gods morde doth not ſuffre. Wherfore although Gelaſius, and other argue frō the Sacrament, to declare the myſterye of Chriſtes perſon, yet we maye not preſſe the

argument to diſtroy, orcōfounde the proprietie of eche myſterye, and ſo violate the rules of our fayth, and in the authours not preſſe the wordes otherwiſe then they maye agree with the Catholique teachynge, as thoſe did in the wordes of Cyrill, when he ſpeake of nature and ſubſiſtence whereof, I made mention before to be remembred here in Gelaſius, that we preſſe not the worde ſubſtance and nature in him: but as maye agree with the tranſition he ſpeaketh of, by which word other expreſſe tranſubſtātiaciō. And againſt theutichians, for to improue ther confuſion, it ſuffiſeth to ſhewe two different natures to be in the Sacrament, and to remaine in there proprietie, and the diuine nature not to confounde the earthely nature, nor as it were to ſwalow it, whiche was the dreme of the Eutichians. And we muſte forbere to preſſe, all partes of thexample in the other argument, from the perſonne of man, beynge one of bodye and ſoule, whiche the Churche dothe profeſſe in ſymbole Athanaſij of all receyued. For Chriſt is one perſonne of two perfitte natures, whereof the one was before the other in perfection &amp; creator of the other, the one impaſſible, &amp; the other paſſible. Man is of the ſoule and bodye one, two different natures, but ſuche as for there perfection requyred that vnitie, whereof none was before other perfit, of Chriſt we ſaye, he is conſubſtantiall to his father, by the ſubſtaunce

of his godhed, and conſubſtantiall to man, by the ſubſtance of his manhod, but we may not ſo ſay, man is conſubſtantial by his ſoule to angels, and conſubſtantiall in his body to beſtes, becauſe then we ſhould deduce alſo Chriſt by meane of vs to be conſubſtantial to beaſtes, &amp; thus I writ to ſhewe that we may not preſſe thexample in euery parte of it, as thauctor of this booke vpon Gelatius, who ouerturneth his doctrine of the figure. And if that I haue Here ſayde, be well conſidered, there maye appeare the greate ignoraunci of this author in the alleginge of Theodorete, the applinge of him, and ſpeakynge of Neſtorius in the ende. For as the Eutichians reaſonynge (as Saincte Auguſtine ſaith) to cōfonude the Neſtoriās, fel in to an abſurditie in the cōfuſiō of the two natures in chriſt: ſo Theodoretus reaſonyng againſt the Eutichiās, fel in a vehemēt ſuſpiciō to be a neſtoriā, like as S. Auguſtine reaſonyng againſt the maniches for defence of fre will ſemed to ſpeke that the Pellagiās would alowe, and reaſoning againſt Pelagians, ſemed to ſay that the manachees woulde allowe, ſuch a daunger it is to reduce extremities to the meane, wherin Saincte Auguſtine was better purged then Theodorete was, althowgh Theodorete was reconciled. But for example of that I haue ſayde, this argumente of Theodoretus againſte the Eutichians to auoyde

confuſion of natures in Chriſte, ſheweth howe in the ſacremēt (where the truth of the myſterye of the two natures in Chriſt may be as it were in a ſimilitude lerned). the preſence of the bodye of Chriſte there in the Sacrament, doth not altre nature, that is to ſaye, the proprietie of the viſible creatures. This ſayinge was that the Neſtoryans woulde drawe for there purpoſe to proue diſtincre perſons, againſte whome, Cyril trauayled to ſhewe that in the Sacrament the fleſhe of Chriſt that was geuen to be eaten, was geuen not as the fleſhe of a comen man, but as the fleſhe of Godde, wherby appeared the vnitie of the godhed to the manhode in Chriſte in one perſon, and yet no confuſion as Theodoretus doth by his argument Declare. But whither the prynters negligence, or this auctours ouerſight, hath confunded, or confuſed this matter in the vtterynge of it, I can not tell, For the auctour of this booke concludeth ſolemly thus by induction of the premiſſes, that euen ſo the bodye of Chriſte was after thaſcenſion Chaunged in to the godly ſubſtaunce. I wene the printer left out a (not) and ſhoulde haue ſayde not chaunged, in the Godlye Subſtaunce, for ſo the ſence ſhoulde be as Peter Martyr reaporteth Theodorete. And yet the triumphe this auctore makethe againſte them, he calleth for his pleaſure Papiſtes, with

his forked dylemma maketh me Doubte, whither he wiſte what he ſayde, or no: becauſe he bryngeth in Neſtorius ſo out of purpoſe, ſayinge the Papiſtes, muſte eyther graunt the Subſtance of breade and wyne to remaylie, orelles to be of Neſtorius hereſie that the nature of Godhed remayned not.
               This auctoure of the booke for the name of Neſtorius, ſhoulde haue put Entiches, and then ſayde for concluſion, the nature of manhode remayned not in Chriſte. And althoughe in Theodorete the ſubſtāce of bread is ſpoken of 
                     •
                  o remayne, yet becauſe he doch after expounde himſelfe to ſpeake of that is ſeen, and feit he femeth to ſpeake of Subſtaunce after the comen capacitie, and not as it is truely in learnynge vnderſtanded, an inwarde inuiſible and not palpable nature, but onely perceyued by vnderſtandynge, ſo as this outwarde nature that Theodorete ſpeaketh of, maye accordynge to his wordes trewly remayne not with ſtandynge trauſubſtantiaction, This auctoure Declareth playnely his iguoraunce not to perceyue, whither the argumente of Theodorete and Gelaſius tendeth, whiche is properly againſte the Eutichians rather then the Neſtorians. For and no propertye of breade remayne, it proueth not the

Godhed in Chriſte not to remayne, but the humanitie onely to be as it were ſwalowed vp of the diuinite whiche the Eutichians entended and ſpecially after Chriſtes reſurrection, againſte whom the argument by Theodorere is ſpecially brought, howeſoeuer this auctor confounbeth the Neſtoryans and Eutichians names and taketh one for an other, whiche in ſo highe a matter is no ſmale faulte, and yet no great fault among ſo many, other howger and greter, as be in this booke committed, wherin this auctor not ſeynge howe lytell he hath done, concludeth yet as conſtantly as though he had throwen all downe afore him, entendyng to ſhewe that the doctrine of tranſubſtantiacion dependeth onely of anctorite whiche is not ſo, vſyng the ſayinges of duns and Gabriel (as he reporteth them) for his purpuſe, becauſe they (as he ſaith) boſt them ſelfe what they coulde do if the determina, cion of the conſaille were not, and thus euery idle ſpeache maye haue eſtimacion with this auctor againſt the receyued truth. And from this poynte of the matter, the auctour of this booke, maketh a paſſage with a litell ſporte at thē he fanſieth or liketh to cal ſo Engliſhe Papiſtes by the waye, entrepriſe to anſwere all ſuche as he ſuppoſeth reaſons for tranſubſtanciation and auctorites alſo.
               Firſt he findeth himſelfe myrth in deuiſynge

as he calleth them the Papiſtes, to ſaye that Chriſte is made a newe, whiche, fanſye if it were ſo, is againſte the reall prefence aſwell as tranſubſtantiacion. In whiche wordes becauſe euery wiſe reader may eſe howe this auctor playeth: I will ſaye no more but this, Chriſte is not made a newe, nor made of the ſubſtaunce of bread as of a matter, and that to be the Catholique doctrine, this auctor if he be right named knoweth welynough, and yet ſpendeth two leanes in it.
               The ſolution to the ſeconde reaſon is allmoſt as foundely handled, alludynge from impanatiō to Inaquation, although it was neuer ſayde in Scripture, this water is the holy ghooſt, but in baptiſme to be water and the holy gooſt alſo, &amp; of the dowe is not ſayd this is the holy ghooſt, but the holy ghoſt deſcended as in the reſemblāce of a dowe. The ſubſtance of bread is not adnihilate becauſe goddes worke is no adnihilation, who geueth all beynge, and adnihilacion is a defection of the creature from God, and yet Chriſtes bodye is not augmēted by the ſubſtāce of bread, in which body it endeth by cō
                  nerſiō, as in the better without adnihilatiō, which is a changyng by miracle. And when this auctor knoweth this, or ſhoulde haue known it, or hath forgotten it, he wryteth like one that were ignoraunt, and had red no

thing in the matter, as it were to make himſelfe populer, to ioyne himſelfe in ignoraunce with the rude vnlerned people. A thirde reaſon this auctor frameth himſelfe, werby to take occaſion to afferme howe the .vi. chaptre of ſainct Iohn ſhuld not apperteyne to the Sacramētal māducation, the contrary wher of, apperith aſwell by the wordes of Chriſt in that .vi. chaptre, ſaing I will gyue, not I do gyue, which promiſe was fullfilled in the ſupper as alſo hy the catholique wryters and ſpecially by Cyril, and therfore I will not Ioh. 6. further ſtryue with this auctour in that matter but ſee howe he can aſſoyle thauctorites, wherunto he entreth with greate cōfidence.
               Firſt in Cyprian who ſpeketh playnelie in the matter, this auctor fyndetha fault that he is not holly alleged, wherupon this auctor bryngeth in the ſentence followinge not neceſſary Cyprianus. to be reherſed, for the matter of tranſubſtantiaciō, and hanſom to be reherſed for the ouerthrowe of the reſt of this auctours newe catholique faith, &amp; whither that nowe ſhall be added was materiall in the matter of tranſubſtanciacion, I require the Iudgement of the (o reader).
               The firſt wordes of Cyprian be theſe. This breade whiche our lorde gaue to his diſciples chaunged in nature, but not in outwarde forme, is by the ōmnipotencye of gods worde De c
                        ••
                     
                     na dn̄i. made fleſhe. Theſe be Cyprianus wordes

then folowe thies, As in the perſon of Chriſt the humanite was ſeen &amp; the diuinite hiddē, euen ſo the diuinite ineffably infuſed it ſelfe in to the viſible Sacrament, Thus ſaith Cyprian as I can engliſhe hym to expreſſe the worde (infudit) by (latin engliſhe) not liking thē gliſhe worde ſhed, becauſe in our engliſhe tonge it reſembleth ſpillyng and euacuation of the hole, and much leſſe I can agree to vſe the worde powrynge although (infunde) in laten, maye in the vſe of earthly thynges ſignifie ſo, becauſe powring noteth a ſucceſſiue workyng, wheras gods worke is in an inſtant and for that reſpecte neuer ſheddynge, But this auctor had a fāſye to vſe the ſounde of the worde powryng, to ſerue in ſtede of an argumēt to improue tranſubſtantiacion, meanyng the hearer or reader in the conceyuyng of the ſence of Cypryan thus termed, ſhould fanſye the bread in the viſible Sacrament, to be like a ſoppe wherupon lyquor were powred, which is a kynde of deprauation, as thou reader by conſideration of Cyprians wordes, &amp; meanyng may eſt perceyue, which Cypriā, hath ſheued howe the bread is made fleſhe by the omnipotēcie of gods worde, and made by chāge. Thē becauſe this myſterie of the Sacramēt, in cōſideration of the two natures, celeſtial, &amp; earthly, reſembleth the principal miſterie of Chriſtes perſōne, S Cypriā ſaith in ſēce, that as in the perſō of Chriſt the humanite was ſeen &amp; the diuinite hidden, ſo

likewiſe in this Sacramēt viſible, is alſo the diuine nature hidden. This is the ſēce where for declaraciō of the worke of god preſetyng his diuine nature, there is vſed the verbe (infudit) in latyn, by whiche worde the motion of the diuine nature is ſpokē of in ſcriptures, not becauſe it is a liquide ſubſtāce to be poured, as thauctor of this booke engliſhethit, ſignifiyng a ſucceſſiue operation, but rather as a worde, if we ſhould ſcanne it, as this auctor would, ſignifiyng the cōtinuāce of the terme feō whence, to the terme whervnto with out leauyng the one by motion to the other, for there is in the godly nature no local motion, &amp; therfor we ſay, chriſt not leauing his father deſcēded frō heauē, &amp; being in earth was alſo in heuē, which cōfuſiō in ſum parte reſē
                  bleth, but mās words cā not expreſſe gods diuine operaciōs. To the purpoſe the firſt word of Cypriā ſhewe the maner of the cōſtitucion of this ſacramēt, to be by muraciō of the earthly creatures, in to the body &amp; blod of chriſt And the by the wordes folowing, ſheueth the truth of the ſubſtāce of the ſacramēt, to thintēt we might vſe our repayre to it, and frame our deuotiō according to the dignite of it, eſte ming as S. Paule ſaith our lordes body, for the more euident declaratiō wherof, S. Cypriā by example of the myſterye in Chriſtes perſon, ſheueth Chriſtes humanite, and diuinite preſent in the viſible ſacramēt, of which diuinite, there is ſpeciall mencion againſte

ſuch, whiche fanſied the fleſh of Chriſt to begyuen, to be eaten, as diuided from the diuine nature, whiche was the hereſie of the Neſtoriās, and ſuch other denying, therby the perfite vnite of the two natures in Chriſt, which the holy Sinode of Epheſus did ſpecially cō
                  dempne, as other fathers in there wrytinge did ſpecially preuēte with diſtincte wryting againſt that errour, and therfore ſainct Cyprian not content to ſhew the preſence of Chriſtes fleſhe by mutacon of the bread, doth after make ſpeciall mencion of Chriſtes diuinite, not correcting that he had ſaid before, but further openynge it, And ſo vtterby condempneth the teachynge of thauctor of this booke, towching the preſence of Chriſt to be onely figura tiuely. Cyprian ſaith that in the ſacrament is the truth, and then there is preſent the true fleſhe of Chriſt, and the godhed truly, whiche deuotion ſhould knowelege &amp; as for tranſubſtāciation according to the firſt wordes of ſainct Cypriā, the bread is chaunged not informe, but in nature, whiche is not in the proprietes of nature, nor in the operacion of nature, neither in quantite, or qualite of nature, and therfore in the inwarde nature, whiche is properly ſubſtaunce. This is the playne directe vnderſtandynge, not by way of addition, as this auttor of his ymaginatiō diuiſeth, who vſeth the worde ſpirituall, as a ſtop, and oppoſition to the catholique teaching, whiche is not ſo and clerelye without

earnyng compareth with this Sacrament, the water of Baptiſme, of whiche we reade not wryten that it is chaunged, as we reade of the breade, and therfore the reſemblaunce of water in Baptiſme, is vſed onely to blinde the rude reader and ſerueth for a ſhifte of talke to wynde out of that matter that cannot be anſwered, and as euill debters ſhake of there creditours with a by communicacion, ſo this auctor conueyeth himſelfe awaye at a backe dore by water, not doynge firſt as he promiſed to anſwere, ſo as he would auoyde Cyprian directly by laude.
               Anſwerynge to Chriſoſtome, this auctor Chryſo. complayneth, as he did in Cyprian, of malicyous leauyng out of that, whiche when it is brought in, doth nothing empayre that went before. Chriſoſtome woulde we ſhoulde conſider the ſecrete truth of this myſterie, where Chriſte is the Inuiſible Prieſte, and miniſtreth in the viſible churche by his viſible miniſter, the viſible Prieſte, whereof Chriſoſtome woulde by his wordes put vs in remē
                  brance, not deniyng therby the viſible miniſterye no more then he doth in his other wordes denye the viſible forme of bread, and yet woulde we ſhould not loke onely vpon that, but whither fayth directeth vs, that is to ſaye, vpon the very bodye of Chriſt there inuiſiblye preſent, whiche fayth knoweth, and knoweth it to be there the very bodye, and there therfore to be no breade, which breade

this true confeſſion of Chriſtes body preſent by fayth excludeth. But touchyng the Prieſt Sainct Chriſoſtomes words do by no meane teach vs that, there is no viſible Prieſte, but to thinke that the bodye of Chriſte is delyuered of Chriſtes handes, which excludeth not in like ſorte the miniſtre viſible, as fayth doth the ſubſtaunce inuiſible of bread in the Sacrament. The one ſaiynge of Chriſoſtome is a godlye exhortacion accordynge to the truth, the other is a doctrine of fayth in the truth, we be not taught that the Prieſte is Chriſt, but we be taught that the ſubſtaunce of the breade is made Chriſtes body. And then the queſtiō in the wordes of Chriſoſtome (Seeſt thou breade) is as muche to ſaye, as remembreſt thy fayth? as beynge one of the faythfull that knowe? whiche terme Saincte Auguſtine vſed. And then Chriſoſtome to conferme oure fayth in ſo high a myſterye, declareth howe we ſhoulde thinke Chriſte to delyuer his bodye himſelfe as a thynge farre excedynge mannes power to do it. And with other heauenlye wordes ſetteth forthe the greateneſſe of that myſterye, with wordes of godlye and good meditacion conueniente for ſo high a matter to adourne it accordynglye, whiche becauſe they be holſome and mete allegoryes, wherwith to drawe and lifte vp our myndes to celeſtiall thoughtes, we maye not therby eſteme the ſubſtaunce

of that myſterye, to be but in allegorye, here in flede of a ſolution the auctor fylieth thre whole leaues with pro

                   before all his countrye frindes in playne Engliſhe, It is a good argumente ſyr quod he, but no thynge to the purpoſe, and ſo is of this matrier the entreatynge of deniall by compariſon good, but nothynge to the purpoſe here, and it is an obſeruacion that requireth good iudgemente, or elles maye therby be induced many abſurdities. Chryſoſtome as I ſayde before ſpeakynge to the Chriſten man, ſemeth to aſke whither he vſeth his fayth or no, For if he ſeeth breade, he ſeeth not with faith, whiche ſeeth the bodye of Chriſt there preſence, and ſo no breade. If the Chriſten man thinke of paſſage throughe him of the celeſtiall fode, he hathe therein no ſpirituall thoughte, ſuche as fayth engendreth, and therfore ſayth Chryſoſtome (abſit) here in theſe wordes of Chriſoſtome is no denyall with compariſon, and therfore this auctour mighte haue ſpared his treatiſe in theſe thre leaues, For in thoſe wordes, when

Chriſoſtome ſaith, Thinke not thou receyueſt the bodye of Chriſte by a man. &amp;c. There this auctour ſo neglecteth his / owne rule, as in his thirde booke he maketh a ſolemne argument that by thoſe Chriſoſtomes wordes we receyue not the bodye of Chriſt at all, ſeyng Chriſoſtome ſayth, we may not thinke we receyue it by man. So lytell ſubſtancially is this matter handled, as a man might ſaye here were many accidentall wordes withoute a ſubſtaunce, or myracle, howe ſtrange ſo euer the ſame ſeme to this auctor otherwiſe.
               Nowe let vs here what this auctor will ſaye to Saincte Ambroſe. He reherſeth him at good lenght, but tranſlateth him for aduantage. As among other in one place where Saincte Ambroſe ſayth. This Sacramente whiche thou receyueſt, is made by the worde of Chriſt, this auctor tranſlateth, is done by the worde of Chriſt, becauſe makynge muſte be vnderſtanded in the ſubſtaunce of the Sacrament chiefly before it is receyued, and doynge maye be referred to the effecte chieflye, for whiche purpoſe, it ſhoulde ſeme thauctor of this booke cannot awaye with the worde made, where at it pleaſeth him in an other place of this booke to be merye, as at an abſurditie in the Papiſtes, when in dede both Saincte Ambroſe here, Saincte Cyprian,

and Sainct Hierome alſo in there places vſe the ſame worde ſpeakynge of this Sacrament, and of the wonderfull worke of God in ordenyng the ſubſtance of it, by ſuch a conuerſion as breade is made the bodye of Chriſte. But as touchynge thanſwere of this auctor to Sainct Ambroſe, it is diuerſe. For firſt he doth trauerſe thauctoritie of the booke, whiche allegation hath been by other here to fore made, and anſwered vnto in ſuch wiſe, as the booke remayneth Saincte Ambroſes ſtill, and Melācton ſaith it ſemeth not to him vnlike his, and therfore allegeth this verye place out of him againſt Oecolampadius. This auctor will not ſticke in that allegation: but for anſwere ſayth that Saincte Ambroſe ſaith not that the ſubſtaunce of the breade, and wyne is gone, and that is true, he ſayth not ſo in ſyllables, but he ſayth ſo in ſence: becauſe he ſpeaketh of a chaunge ſo playnelye in the breade into that it was not, wherunto this auctor for declaration of change ſayth, the breade and wyne be changed into an higher aſtate, nature, and condition, whiche thre wordes, of aſtate, nature, and condition, be good wordes, to expreſſe the chaunge of the breade into the bodye of Chriſte, whiche bodye is of an other nature, an other ſtate, and condition, then the ſubſtaunce of the breade without cōpariſon hygher.

But then this auctor addeth, (to be taken as holye meates, and drinkes) wherein if he meaneth to be taken ſo, but not to be ſo, as his teachynge in other places of this boke is, the breade to be neuer the holyer, But to ſignifie an holy thynge: then is the chaunge nothynge in dede touchynge nature, but onelye as a cowarde maye be channged in apparell to playe Hercules, or Sampſons parte in a playe, himſelfe therby made neuer the hardyer man at all, but onelye appoynted to ſignifie an hardye man, of whiche mannes chaunge, althoughe his aſtate, and condition might in ſpeache be called chaunged for the tyme of the playe, yet no man woulde terme it thus to ſaye, his nature were changed, whither he mente by the worde nature the ſubſtaunce of the mannes nature, or propertie, for in theſe two poyntes he were ſtill the ſame man in Hercules coote, that he was before the playe in his owne, ſo as if there be nothynge, but a figure in the bread, then for ſo much this auctors other teaching in this booke where he ſayth, the breade is neuer the holyer, is a doctrine better then this, to teache a chaunge of the breade to an higher nature, when it is onelye appoynted to ſignifie an holye thynge? And therfore this auctours anſwere garniſhed with theſe there gaye wordes of aſtate, nature, and condicion, is diuiſed but for a ſhifte, ſuche as

agreeth not with other places of this booke nor in it ſelfe neyther. And where Saincte Ambroſe merueyleth at goddes worke in the ſubſtaunce of the Sacrament, this auctour ſhifteth that alſo to the effecte in him that receyueth, whiche is alſo meruelous in deade, but the ſubſtaunce of the Sacramente is by Saincte Ambroſe ſpiritually merueyled at, howe breade is made the bodye of Chriſt the viſible matter outwardely remayninge, and onelye by an inwarde chaunge, whiche is of the inwarde nature, called properlye ſubſtaunce in learnynge, and a ſubſtaunce in dede, but perceyued onely by inwarde vnderſtandynge as the ſubſtaunce preſent of Chriſtes moſte precious body, is a very ſubſtance in dede of the bodye inuiſiblye preſente, but preſent in dede, and onelye vnderſtanded by moſte true and certen knowledge of fayth. And although this auctor noteth howe in the examples of mutacion brought in by Sainct Ambroſe, the ſubſtaunces neuer the leſſe remayned the ſame: that ſkilleth not, for the wonder of thoſe meruelles ſerue for an induction to releaue the weake fayth of man in this miracle of the Sacramente, and to repreſſe the arrogancie of reaſon, preſumynge to ſerche ſuche knowledge in goddes ſecrete workes, whereof if there might be a reaſon geuen, it neded no fayth. And where there is a like, there is no ſingularite as this miracle in the Sacramente in notablye ſinguler

and therfore none other founde like vnto it. The Sacramentall mutation, which this auctor newly ſo termeth, is a mere ſhifte to auoyde amonge ſuche, as be not lerned, the truthe of goddes miracle in this chaunge, whiche is in dede ſuche as Sainct Ambroſe ſpeaketh of, that of bread is made the bodye of Chriſte, whiche Sainct Ambroſe in an other place, termeth it the grace of the body of Chriſte, and all is one for it is a greate grace, to haue the bodye of Chriſt for our foode preſent there. And out of Chriſtes mouth, callynge the bodye of Chriſte, is makynge the bodye of Chriſte, whiche wordes callyng, ſignifiynge, namynge vſed in ſainct Ambroſe wrytynges, do not limite Chriſtes wordes, and reſtrayne them to anonely callyng, an only ſignifiyng, or an only naming, but geue an vnderſtādyng agreable to other of Sainrt Ambroſe wordes, that ſhewe the breade after conſecracion to be the bodye of Chriſt, the callyng to be vnderſtanded a real callynge of the thynge that ſo is made, and likewiſe a reall ſignifiynge of the thynge in dede preſent, and a reall namynge, as the thynge is in dede. As Chriſte was named (Ieſus), becauſe he is the ſauiour of his people in dede. And thus peruſynge this auctors anſwers, I truſt I haue noted to the reader, with howe ſmall ſubſtaunce of matter this auctor impugneth tranſubſtanciation, and

howe ſlenderly he goeth about to anſwere ſuche auctors, as by their ſeueral writynges conferme the ſame, beſides the conſent of Chriſtēdom vniuerſally receyuyng the ſame. And howe in the meane waye, this auctor hath by his owne handes pulled downe the ſame vntrue doctrine of the figuratiue ſpeache, that himſelfe ſo lately hath diuiſed, or rather becauſe this matter in his book goeth before, he hath in this ſeconde booke marred his frame, or euer he cummeth to the thirde booke to ſet it vp. In the ſeconde volume of the. 43. leef, the auctor goeth about to note. 6. abſurdites in the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation, whiche I entende alſo to peruſe, This firſt is this.
               Firſt if the Papiſtes be demanded what thyng it The auctor is, that is broken, what is eaten, and what is chawed, with the teath lippes, &amp; mouth in this Sacramēt, they haue nothynge to anſwere, but thaccidentes. For as they ſay bread, and wyne be not the viſible elementes in this Sacrament, but onely ther accidentes, and ſo they be forſed to ſaye that accidentes be broken, eaten, Dronken, chawed, and ſwalowed without any ſubſtaunce at all, whiche is not onely againſte all reaſon, but alſo againſte the doctrine of all auncient auctors.
               This is accompted by this auctor, the The an

                     wer. firſt abſurdire, &amp; inconuenience, whiche is by him rhetorically ſetforth with uppes, and mouth, and chawynge, not ſubſtanciall termes to the matter, but accidentall. For opeuynge

of whiche matrer, I will repete ſum parte agayne of that I haue wryten before, when I made the ſcoler anſwere the rude man in declaration of ſubſtaunce, whiche is that, albeit that ſenſible thynge whiche in ſpeache vttered after the capacite of comen vnderſtandyng, is called ſubſtaunce be comprehended of oure ſences: yet the inwarde nature of euery thyng whiche is in lernynge properly called ſubſtance is not ſo diſtinctly knowen of vs, as we be able to ſhewe it to the ſences, or by wordes of difference to diſtincte in diuers kyndes of thynges one ſubſtaunce from another. And herin (as Baſill Baſilius homil. 1. H

                  e the ſubſtance by it ſelfe alone, we ſhould in the experience fayle of our purpoſe and ende in nothyng in dede. There is a natural conſideration of the abſtractes, that can not be practiſed in experience. And to me, if it were aſked of comen bread, when me breeke it, whether we breke the ſubſtaunce, or onely the accidentes, firſt I muſt lernedly ſay, if the ſubſtaunce be broken, it is by meane of the accident in quantite, and then if it like me, to take my pleaſour without lernyng in philoſophie, as this auctor doth in diuinite againſt the catholike fayth, to ſay in diuiſion we breke not the ſubſtāce of bred at all, the hereſie in philoſophie were not of ſuche abſurdite, as this auctor maynteyneth in diuinite. For I haue ſome

probable matter to ſay for me, wher he hath none, For my ſtrāge anſwere, I would ſaye that albeit a natural thing as bread cōſiſting of matter, &amp; eſſencial forme whiche quātite, &amp; therby other accidentes cleauyng &amp; annexed may be wel ſaid to be in the hole broken, as we ſee by experience it is: yet ſpeakyng of the ſubſtāce of it alone, if one ſhold aſke whether that be broken, &amp; it ſhould be anſwered yee, thē ſhould the ſubſtāce appeare brokē &amp; hole al at one tyme, ſeyng in euery broken piece of breade, a hole ſubſtance of bread, &amp; wher the piece of bread brokē is ſo lytell a crumme, as can no more in dede be deuided we ſay neuertheleſſe the ſame to be one ſubſtaunce verie bread, &amp; for want of cōueniēt quātite bread in diuiſible, &amp; thus I write to ſhewe that ſuch an anſwer to ſay the accidēts be brokē, hath no ſuch clere abſurdite, as this auctor would haue it ſeme. But leauynge of the matter of philoſophie to the ſcoles, I wil graūt that accidētes to be without ſubſtāce is againſt the comē courſe of natural thīges, &amp; thefore therī is a ſpecial miracle of god. But whē the accidētes be by miracle without ſubſtāce as they be in the viſible ꝑt of the ſacramēt: thē the ſame accidētes to be brokē, catē, &amp; drōkē with al thaditiōs this auctor for his pleaſur maketh therī, is no miracle, or meruaile, &amp; as for abſur dite no poīt at al, for by quātite which remaineth is al diuiſiō. we ought to cōfeſſe, &amp; good chriſten men do profeſſe, the myſterye of the

Sacramēt to be ſupernatural, and aboue the ordre of nature, &amp; therfore it is a trauayle in vayne to frame the conſideratiō of it to agree with the termes of philoſophye, But where this auctor ſaith that nothyng can be anſwered to be brokē but the accidētes: yes verely, for in tyme of contēciō, as this is to him that would aſke, what is brokē, I would in other termes anſwere thus, That thou ſeeſt is broken. And thē if he would aſke further, what that is, I would tell him the viſible matter of the Sacrament, vnder whiche is preſent Inuiſibly the ſubſtance of the moſt precious body of Chriſt, if he will aſke yet further, Is that bodye of Chriſt broken, I will ſay no. For I am lerned in fayth, that that glorious body nowe impaſſible can not be broken, or diuided, and therfore it is holy in euery parte of that is broken, as the ſubſtaunce of bread is in comen bread in euery parte that is broken, accordyng wherunto, it is in the booke of comen prayour ſetforth, howe in eche part of that is broken, is the hole body of our ſauiour Chriſt. If this queſtioner be further curious and ſaye, is not that, that is broken breade? I woulde anſwere, as a beleuynge man by fayth truely no, For in fayth I muſt call it, becauſe it is truely ſo, the bodye of Chriſte inuiſibly there, and the breakynge to be not in it, but in the viſible ſigne. Yea ye will call it ſo ſayth this queſtioner, but yet it is bread: Nay quod I, my

ſayth is a moſt certaine truth, and beleueth thinges as they verily be, for Chriſtes worde is of ſtrenght, not onely to ſhewe, and declare as other mens wordes do, but therwith effectual to make it ſo to be, as it is by him called. And this I write becauſe howſoeuer clerkes ſoberly entreate the matter (ſuch as mynde well I meane) to conſider accidētes, and ſubſtāce whiche termes the rude vnderſtāde not, it is not neceſſarye therfore in thoſe termes, to make anſwere to ſuche as be cōtentiouſly curious, who labour with queſtiōs to diſſolue the truth of the miſterie, in declaraciō wherof, we as men ſtumble and terme it otherwiſe then we ſhuld, that is no Incōueniēce in the miſterie, but an imparfection in vs that be not able to expreſſe it, not hauinge ſuch giftes of god as other haue, nor ſtudyinge to atteyne lernyng as other haue done. And whatſoeuer in ſcoles with a deuoute mynde to auſ were al captious queſtions hath for thexercitation of mennes ſenſes bene moued ſoberly and by way of argument obiected: that is nowe picked out by this auctor, and brought to the comen peoples cares in which it might ſounde euill they not beinge able to make anſwere therūto, wherby they might be ſnarled, and intāgled with vayne fanſes againſt that truth, which before without curioſite of queſtions, they truely and cōſtantly beleued. Finally the doctrine of the ſacrament is ſimple and playne, to haue the viſible fourmes

of breade and wyne for ſignificatiō, the thing wherof in the verye bodye &amp; bloud of Chriſt, which beyng the truth of the hole it is no abſurdite to cōfeſſe truely the partes as they be if occaſiō require, howeſoeuer it ſoundeth to the Ethnike or carualic mannes eares, for whoſe ſatiſfaction there is no cauſe why the truth ſhould be altred into alye, wherwith to make melody to ther vnderſtādinges. For howſoeuer carnall reaſon be offended with ſpiritual truth, it forceth not but againſt the hole conſent of the auncient doctors, no doctrine cā be inſtified, with whoſe reſtimonie, howe the fayth of the church in the ſacramēt nowe agreeth, it is manifeſt howſoeuer it liketh this auctor to reaporte the contrarye.
               Secondly theſe Tranſubſtātiators do ſay contrarye to all lernynge: that accidentes of bread and The auctor. wyne do hange alone in thaire without any ſubſtance: wherin they may be ſtayed: and what may be ſayd more folyſhelye.

                     t. 9. q. 10. of this myſterie telleth what ſume ſay that had reather ſaye ſum what, then nothinge, which this auctor reherſith, as a determinacion of the church, that in dede maketh no doctrine of that pointe ſo, but acknowlegith the miſterie to excede our capacite. And as for the accidentes to be ſtayed, that is to ſaye, to remayne without there natural ſubſtance, is without difficultie beleued of men that haue ſayth conſideryng thalmightie power of

Chriſt, whoſe diuine body is there preſent. And ſhall that be accompted for an inconuenience in the miſterie, that any one man ſaith whoſe ſayinge is not as a full determinaciō approued? If that man ſhould encontre with this auctor, if he were a lyue ſo to do, I thinke he would ſaye it were more tollerable in him of a zeale to agree with the true doctrine to vtter his cōſeyte fōdly, then of a malice to diſſēt frō the true doctrine this auctor ſo fondly to improwe his ſayinge. But if he ſhould oppoſe this auctor in lernynge, and aſke him howe he wyll vnderſtand (Fiat lux) in the creatiō of the world, where the light ſtayed that was then create, But I will procede to peruſe the other abſurdities.
               Thirdly that the ſubſtance of Chriſtes body is there The auctor. really: corporally: and naturally / preſent without any accidentes of the ſame. And ſo the papiſtes make accidentes to be with out ſubſtance and ſubſtance without accidentes.

                   howſoeuer it liketh this auctor with out the booke to

                   it at his pleaſur, &amp; to ſpeke of ſubſtāce without accidētes, &amp; accidē
                  tes

without ſubſtaunce: whiche perplexite in wordes cannot ieſte out the truth of the catholique bilyefe. And this is on thauctours part nothinge but ieſtinge with a wrōge ſurmiſe and ſuppoſall as though men had inuī
                  ted, and ymagined that whiche by force and truth of the ſcripture all good men haue and muſt byleue, that is to ſaye, the true preſence of the ſubſtance of the body and bloud of Chriſt in the Sacrament accordinge to the wordes of Chriſt: This is my body, whiche exclude the ſubſtance of breade, declaringe the ſubſtance of the body of Chriſt, to be acknoweleged, and profeſſed in the Sacrament, by the true faith of a Chriſtē man. Cō
                  pare with this, what this auctor writeth in his 9 difference, in the 47 leafe of his booke, and ſo conſider the truth of this reaport and howe this auctor agreeth with himſelfe.
               Fourthly they ſaye that the place where the bread and wyne be, hath no ſubſtance there to fyll that The auctor. place, and ſo muſt there nedes be graunted (vacuum) whiche nature abhorreth.
               This auctor goeth a bout to finde ſo many abſurdites that he ſpeketh he woteth not The anſwer. what, &amp; where he ſeeth and fealith quantite, accōmpteth the place voyd for want of ſubſtance, as though in conſideration of comen natural thinges ſeuerally as thei be in nature, it were the ſubſtance that filled the place and not rather quantite, although in the natural ordre of thinges there is no quantite

without ſubſtance, and is in this Sacrament onely by miracle. There wanted a ſubſtaunce in conſideracion of this abſurditie, and was ſuche a vacuum, as nature playnelye endureth.
               Fiftely they are not aſſhamed to ſaye that ſubſtance The auctor. is made of accidentes, whē the bread mouldeth or is turned into wormes, or the wyne ſowreth.
               True beleuyng men ar not aſhamed to cō
                  feſſe The anſwer. the truth of there fayth, whatſoeuer argumentes might be brought of experience in nature to the contrarye. For Chriſts workes we knowe to be trewe by moſt certain fayth what mouldeth in bread, or ſowreth in wine, we be not ſo aſſured, or where on wormes engendre, it is not ſo fully agreed on amonge men. The learned lawer Ulpian writeth (as I haue before alleged) that wyne and vinegre haue in maner one ſubſtance ſo as when wyne ſowreth and is vinagre in maner the ſame ſubſtaunce remayneth in whome it is thought no abſurditie to ſay by that meanes that the accidentes onely ſower. And if we agree with the Philoſophers that there is (Materia prima) whiche in all thinges is one, and altereth not, but as a newe forme cummeth, taketh a newe name, fanſinge that as one waue in the water thruſteth a way another, ſo doth one fourme an other: it ſhoulde ſeme by this concluſion all alteracion to be in accidentes, and the corruption of accidentes to be the generacion of newe accidentes, the

ſame (Materia prima) beyng as it were (ſubſtancia) that altereth not. And this I wryte that maye be ſayde as it were to make a title to this auctours certayntie whiche is / not ſo ſure as he maketh it. Amonges men haue been meruelous fanſies in cōſideracion of naturall thinges, and it is to me a verye greate abſurdite of that ſecrete, and therfore to our knowledge an vncertein worke, to deduce an argument, wherwith to impugne oure certaine faith. But to cum nerer to the purpoſe, it is wronge borne in hande, that we affirme wormes to be engendred of accidentes, but when the wormes be engendred we graunte the wormes to be, and will rather ſay wherof they be we cannot tel, then to ſay that ſubſtance is made of accidēces, and that doctrine is not annexed to the fayth of tranſubſtantiacion, and ſuch as entreate thoſe chaunces and accidentes do not induce that concluſiō, but do reaſonably auoyde it. And yet by the waye in mouldyng and ſowrynge it ſhoulde me ſemeth be properly ſayd that the accidentes moulde, and the accidentes ſowre, becauſe we call moulde bread, bread, ſo wer wyne, wyne, and in wyne as I ſayde before made vinigre, the former ſubſtaunce hathe been in lernyng accompted in maner to remayne, ſo as this auctor ouerſhoteth himſelfe when he matcheth generacion of wormes with mouldyng &amp; ſowryng, which differ ſo farre in ther ſpeculation. But euen as this auctors wyt is

ouerturned in conſideracion of the true faith, ſo doth it appeare peruerted in conſideracion of natural thinges. The .vi. abſurdite is this.
               Sixtly that ſubſtance is nuxriſhed without ſubſtance The auctor. by accidē
                  
                     •
                  es onely, if it chaūce any catt, mouſe, dogge or any other thinge to eate the Sacramentall bread or drinke the Sacramentall wyne.
               It hath been heard without fables of certain The anſwer. men that haue lyued and been nurriſhed with ſauors onely and in golde and certaine precious ſtones that they gyue a kinde of nurritour to an other ſubſtance without diminution of their ſubſtāce, experiēce hath ſhewed it ſo, &amp; therfore the principel or maxime that this auctor gathereth, hathe no ſuche abſurdite in it, as he noteth to ſaye that ſubſtance is nurriſhed without ſubſtaunce. But when vermyne by chaunce happen to deuoure any hooſt, as I am ſure they cannot violate Chriſtes moſt precious body: ſo what effecte foloweth of the reſt, what nedeth it to be diſcuſſed? If it nurriſheth, then doth that effecte remaine although the ſubſtance be not there, If euery nourritour muſte nedes be of ſubſtance, then woulde thoſe that diſcuſſe thoſe chaunces ſay the ſubſtances to retourne, but hele gates ſhall not make me ſpeake againſt my faith. And if I be aſked the queſtion whither the viſible matter of the Sacramēt nurriſhe, I wil anſwere yea, Ergo ſaith he there is ſubſtaunce. I denye it he ſhall nowe from the effecte to the cauſe argue by phyſike,

I ſhal diſprowe the concluſion by thauctorite of fayth, who is it moſt mete ſhuld yelde to other? And if in nature many thinges be in experience countrarye to the generall rules, why maye not one ſinguler condition be in this viſible mattier of the Sacrament, that the ouelye ſubſtance beynge chaunged, all other partes, proprieties, and effectes may remayne? Is it an abſurdite for a mayde to haue a childe, becauſe it is againſte the rules of nature? Is it an abſurdite the worlde to be made of nothynge becauſe the philoſopher faith of nothynge cummeth nothynge? The principall of nature is that whatſoeuer hath a begynnynge hath an ende, and yet it is no abſurdite to beleue our ſoules, to haue a begynnyng without ende, and to be immortall. Wherfore to conclude this mattier, it is a great abſurdite in this auctour, to note that for an abſurdite in our fayth, whiche repugueth onely to the principles of philoſophie or reaſon, whē that is onely to be accompted for an abſurdite, that ſhoulde repugne to the ſcripture, and gods wil, whiche is the ſtāderd to trye the rule of oure faith. Howe ſoeuer reaſon or Philoſophie be offended it forceth not, ſo gods teachynge be embraced, and perſuaded in fayth whiche nedeth no ſuch playſters and ſalues, as this auctour hath diuiſed, to make a ſore where none is, and to corrupte that is whole. The beſt playſtor and medicine that coulde nowe be deuiſed were

to leaue a parte queſtions and idle talke, and mekely to ſubmitte our capacites to the true faith and not to ouerwhelme our vnderſtandynges with ſerche and enquire, wherof we ſhall neuer fynde au ende entrynge the botomleſſe ſecrecye of gods myſteryes. Let vs not ſeke that is aboue our reache, but that God hath commaūded vs let vs do. Ech man impugneth an others learnynge with wordes, none controlleth an others lyuing with better dedes. Let all endeuoure themſelfe to do that God commaūdeth, and the good occupation thereof ſhall exclude all ſuche idelneſſe as is cauſe and occaſion of this vayne and noyſome curioſite. And nowe to retourne to this auctour whiles he ſeath a more in an other mannes eye, he fealeth not a beame in his owne. Who recommendeth vnto vs ſpecially Theodorete whom he calleth an holly Biſhop, and with him doth bringe forth a peace of an Epiſtle of Saincte Chriſoſtome. The doctrine of whiche two ioyned with the doctrine of this auctor in ſuche ſence as this auctour woulde haue all vnderſtanded to be called Catholique, touchynge the faith of the Sacrament hath ſuche an abſurdite in it as was neuer hearde of in religion. For this auctour teacheth for his parte, that the body of Chriſte is onely reallye in heauen and not in dede in the Sacrament, according wherunto this auctor alſo teacheth the bread to be very bread ſtill, which doctrine if it be true as this

auctour will nedes haue it, then ioyne vnto it the doctrine of the ſecrete Epiſtle of Chryſoſtome, &amp; Theodorete whoſe doctrine is that after the conſecracion, that is conſecrate ſhal be called no more bred, but the o
                     •
                  dy of chriſt By theſe two doctrines ioyned together it ſhall appeare that we muſt call that is conſecrate, by a name of that we be learned by this auctour it is not, and may not by the doctrine of Theodorete call it by the name of that which this auctor teacheth vs in dede it is. As thus, It is in dede bread, quod this auctor, but call it not ſo, quod this Theodorete, It is not in dede the body of Chriſt, quod this auctor, but yet in anywiſe cal it ſo quod Theodorete. Here is playne ſimulacion, and diſſimulacion both together. For by forberynge the name of breade accordynge to Theodoretes teachynge, we diſſemble &amp; hide that it is by this auctors teachinge, and by vſinge the name of our Lordes body accordyng to Theodoretes teachyng, we fayne it to be that it is not, by this auctors teachynge whiche ſayth there is only a figure, and by this meanes in ſo high a myſterye we ſhoulde vſe vntruthes on both ſides in ſimulacion and diſſimulaciō, which is a meruelous teachyng. I denye not but thinges ſignifiyng may haue the name of that they ſignifie by a figure of ſpeache: but we reade not in any doctrine geuen that the thynge ſignifiynge ſhoulde haue the name by figure and be deliuered from the name of that

it is in dede. And yet this is nowe the teaching of this auctour in defence of his newe Catholique fayth ioyned with the teachynge of Theodorete, and the ſecrete Epiſtel of S. Chriſoſtome, as this auctor would haue thē vnderſtanded. But thoſe men Theodorete &amp; Chriſoſtome in the ſence they mente as I vnderſtand thē taught a true doctrine. For they take the name of the body of Chriſt in the ſacrament to be a reall namynge of the body of Chriſte there preſente in dede, and therfore a true perfite name, which as S. Chriſoſtomes ſecrete Epiſtel ſaith, the thyng is worthy to haue declaryng, by that worthynes the thing named to be their in dede. And likewiſe I vnderſtande the other name of bread worthely done awaye, becauſe the ſubſtaunce, Wherupon in reaſon the name was grounded, is chaunged accordynge to the true doctrine of tranſubſtantiacion, therfore that name of bread in there doctrine is truely layde away, although Theodorete wryteth the viſible matter of bread and wyne to be ſeen and felt as they were before, and therfore ſaith there ſubſtance which there ſignifieth the outward nature is ſeen and felt to remayne, which termes with conuenient vnderſtandynge maye thus agree with the Catholique teachyng of trāſubſtantiacion and ſo in the Sacramēt on euery part both in the heauēly &amp; earthely part to be a ful, hole, &amp; perfit truth, as the high miſtery beyng the ſacramēt of our perfit vnite in

bodye and ſoule with Chriſte, doth require. Wherby in my Iudgement as this auctour hath againſt his owne determinacion in this enterpriſe vttred that confermeth the truth of the reall preſence of Chriſts moſt precious body in the Sacrament, which he doth in ſpeciall entreatyng the wor

Howbeit as for tranſubſtantiacion Suinglius taketh it truely for a neceſſary conſequēce of the truth if there be in the Sacrament the real preſence of Chriſtes bodye as there is in dede. For as a carnall man not inſtructe by fayth aſwel after conſecracion as before as he is of the earth ſpeaketh and calleth it breade, and aſkynge him what it is wyll neuer anſwere otherwiſe, and if one aſked him whither it were the bodye of Chriſt woulde thinke the queſtioner mocked him, ſo the faythfull ſpirituall man anſweryng to that queſtiō what it is, woulde after conſecracion accordyng to fayth, anſwere the bodye of Chriſte, and thinke himſelfe mocked if he were aſked is it not breade? onles he had been taught Chriſt to haue ſayde it had been both his bodye and bread.

The firſt marke is in the proceſſe of arguyng vſed by them to the conuiction of heretiques by the truth of this Sacramēt, wherin I note not their particuler ſentences whiche ſomtyme be dangerous ſpeaches, but their hole doinges. As Irene who was in the begynnynge of the churche, argueth agaynſt the valentinians, that denyed the reſurrection of our fleſhe, whom Irene reproueth by the feadynge of our ſoules and bodies with the diuine glorified

fleſh of Chriſt in the Sacramēt, whiche fleſh, &amp; it be their but a figure, then it ſhoulde haue proued the / reſurrection of oure fleſhe ſlenderly &amp; as it were but figuratyuely. And if the Catholique fayth had not bene then certenly taught, and conſtātly beleued without variaunce, Chriſtes very fleſhe to be in dede eaten in that miſtery: it would haue bene anſwered of the heretiques it had bene but a figure, but that appeareth nor, and the other appeareth whiche is a teſtymonye to the truth of matter in dede.

S. Chriſoſtom, Belaſius and Theodorete argue of the truth of this miſterie to conuince the Appollinariſtes, and Eutichians, which were noon argument if Chriſtes verie body were not as really preſent in the Sacramēt for the truth of preſence, as the godhed in the perſon of / Chriſt, beynge theffect of thargument this, that as the preſence of Chriſtes body in this

miſterie doth not altre the properties of the viſible natures, no more doth the godhode in the perſon of Chriſt extinguiſhe his humanite, whiche againſte thoſe heretiques ſerued for an argument to exclud confuſion of natures in Chriſt, and had bene a daungerous argument to be embraſed of the Neſtorians, who woulde hereby haue furdred ther hereſie, to proue the diſtinction of natures in Chriſt without any vnion, for they woulde haue ſaid. As the earthly, &amp; heauēly natures be ſo diſtincte in the Sacramēt as the one is not ſpoken of the other, ſo be the natures of the humanite &amp; godhod not vnited in Chriſt, whiche is falſe, and in the comparynge we may not loke that all ſhould anſwere in equalite, but onely for the point it is made for, that is, as in the Sacrament the viſible clement is not extinguiſhed by the preſence of Chriſtes moſt precious body, no more is Chriſtes humanite by his godhode, and yet we may not ſay, that as in the Sacramēt be but onely accidētes of the viſible earthly matter, that therfore in the perſon of Chriſt be onely accidētes of the humanite. For that miſterye requireth the hole truth of mannes nature, and therfore Chriſte toke vppon him the hole man, bodie and ſoule. The myſterye of the Sacrament requirethe the truthe of the accidentes onelye, beynge the ſubſtaunce of the viſible creatures conuerted

into the body &amp; bloude of Chriſt. And this I write to preuent ſuche cauillations as ſome would ſerch fore. But to retourne to our matter all theſe argumētes were vayne, if there were not in the Sacrament the true preſence of Chriſtes very bodye, as the celeſtiall parte of the Sacramēt, beynge the viſible formes therthly thyng. Which earthly thyng remaineth in the former proprietie with the verye preſence of the celeſtial thyng. And this ſuffiſeth concernyng the firſt marke. An other certaine token is the wondryng and great meruelyng that the olde auctours make, howe the ſubſtance of this Sacrament is wrought by goddes omnipotencie. Baptiſme is merueled at, for the wonderfull effecte that is in man by it, howe man is regenerat, not howe the water, or the holy ghooſt is there. But the wondre in this Sacrament is ſpecially directed to the worke of God in the viſible creatures, howe they be ſo changed into the body and bloud of Chriſt, which is a worke of god wrought, before we receyue the Sacrament. Whiche worke Cyprian ſayth is ineſtable, that is to ſay, not ſpeakable, whiche is not ſo Cyprian de coena dn̄i. if it be but a figure, for then it may eaſely be ſpoken, as this auctour ſpeaketh it with eaſe (I thynke) he ſpeaketh it ſo often. Of a preſē
                  ce by ſignification if it may ſo be called, euery man maye ſpeake and tell howe, but of the / verye preſence in dede and therfore the reall preſence of Chriſtes body in the Sacrament,

no creature can tell howe it maye be, that Chriſt aſcended into heauen with his humaine body, and therwith coutinually reignying there ſhould make preſent in the Sacrament the ſame body in dede, whiche Chriſt in dede worketh, beynge neuertheleſſe then at the ſame houre preſent in heauen, as S. Chriſoſoſtom doth with a maruayle ſay. If the maruayle were onely of godes worke in man in theffect of the Sacrament, as it is in Baptiſme, it were an other matter, but I ſaid before the wrondre is in the worke of God, in the ſubſtaunce of the Sacrament, before it be receyued, which declareth tholde auctours that ſo wondre to vnderſtande the reall preſence of Chriſtes verye bodye, and not an onelye ſignification, whiche hathe no wondre at all. And therfore ſeyng S. Cyprian wondreth at it, and calleth the worke ineſtable, S. Chriſoſtom wondreth at it, S. Ambroſe wondreth at it, Emiſſen wondreth at it, Cyrill wondreth at it. What ſhould we nowe doubt whether their fayth were of a ſignification onely as this auctour woulde haue it, which is no wondre at all, or of the reall preſence whiche is in dede a wonderfull worke. Wherfore where this manifeſt token, and certaine marke appeareth in the olde fathers their can no conſtructiō of ſillables, or words diſſuade, or peruerte the truth thus teſtified. A third token their is by declaration of figures as for example S. Hierom when he declareth

vpon thepiſtel (Ad Titum) ſo aduiſedly at lenght howe (Panes prepoſitiones) were the figure of the bodie of Chriſt in the Sacramēt: that proceſſe declareth the mynds of that auctor to be that in the Sacrament is preſent the verie truth of Chriſtes body not in a figure again, to ioyne one ſhadowe to an other, but euen the very truth to anſwere the figure, and therfore no particuler wordes in S. Hierome can haue any vnderſtandynge contrarye to his mynde declared in this proceſſe. Fourthly an other certaine marke is where the olde auctours wryte of the addration of this Sacrament, whiche can not be but to the thynges, godly, really preſent. And therfore S. Auguſtine wrytynge in his booke de (Catechizandis rudibus) howe the Inuiſible thynges be honored in this Sacramēt, meanyng the bodie and bloud of Chriſt, and in the. 98. Pſalme ſpeaketh of adoratiō. Theodoretus alſo ſpekyng ſpecially of adoration of this Sacramēt. Theſe auctours by Theodoretus. Dialogo. 3. this marke that is moſt certaine, take awaye all ſuche ambiguite as men might by ſuſpitions, diuination, gather ſumtyme of their ſeuerall wordes, and declare by this marke of adoratiō playnely their faith to haue bene, and alſo their doctrine vnderſtanded as they ment of the reall preſence of Chriſtes verye bodye and bloud in the Sacrament, and Chriſt himſelfe God, and man to be their

preſent, to whoſe diuine nature and the humanite vnite thervnto, adoration may onely be directed of vs. And ſo to conclude vp this matter foraſmuch as one of theſe foure markes, and notes maye be founde teſtified and apparaunte in the anucient wryters, with other wordes and ſentences conformable to the ſame: this ſhuld ſuffiſe to exclude al argumētes of any by ſentences &amp; ambiguons ſpeaches, and to vpholde the certeynte of the true Catholique fayth in dede, whiche this auctour by a wronge name of the Catholique fayth impugneth, to the greate ſlaunder of the truth and his owne reproch.
            
            
               
               The confutation of the fift booke.
               
                  AS touchynge the fift booke the title wherof is of thoblation and ſacrifice of our Sauiour Chriſt ſomwhat is by me ſpoken before, whiche although it be suffitiēt to the matter, yet ſomewhat more muſt alſo be nowe ſaid, whetwyth to encountre thauctors imaginations and ſurmiſes with the wronge conſtruyng of the Scriptures, and Auctors to wreſt them beſides the truth of the matter and ther meanynge.
               This is agreed and by the Scriptures playnelie taught that the oblation, and Sacrifice of our Sauiour Chriſte was, and is a perfite worke ones conſummate in perfection without neceſſitie of reiteration, as it was neuer taught to be reiterate, but a mere blaſphemie to preſuppoſe it. It is alſo in the Catholike teachyng grounded vpon the ſcripture agreed, that the ſame ſacrifice ones conſomate, was ordeyned by Chriſtes inſtitution in his moſt holye ſupper to be in the churche often remembred and ſhewyd forth in ſuche forte of ſhewyng, as to the faythfull is ſene preſent the moſt precious bodye and bloude

of our Sauiour Chriſt, vnder the fourmes of bread &amp; wyne, which body &amp; bloud the faithfull churche of Chriſten people graunte &amp; confeſſe accordyng to Chriſtes wordes to haue been betrayed &amp; ſhed for the ſins of the world &amp; ſo in the ſame ſupper repreſented, &amp; deliuered vnto them, to eate &amp; feade of it accordyng to Chriſtes commandement, as of a moſt precyous &amp; acceptable ſacrifice, acknolegyng the ſame precious body &amp; bloud, to be the ſacrifice propitiatorie for all the ſinnes of the worlde, wherunto they onely reſorte, and onelye accompt that the verye perfite oblacion &amp; ſacrifice of Chriſten people, through which all other ſacrifices neceſſariely be accepted &amp; pleaſaunt in the ſight of God. And this maner of ſhewyng Chriſtes death &amp; kepyng the memorye of it, is grounded vpō the ſcriptures, wrytē by the Euāgeliſtes, &amp; S.

This auctor vttering many wordes at large beſides ſcripture, &amp; agenſt ſcripture to depratie the Catholike doctrine, doth in a fewe wordes (which be in dede good wordes &amp; true) cōfonde &amp; ouerthrowe al his enterpriſe, &amp; that iſſue wil I ioinewith him, which ſhall ſuffiſe, for the cōfutacion of this booke. The fewe good wordes of the auctor, which wordes I ſaye confounde the reſte, conſiſte in theſe two poyntes. One in that the auctor alloweth the Iudgement of Petrns Lombardus,

touchyng thoblacion, and ſacrifice of the churche. An other in that thauetor confeſſeth the Counſaill of Nice to be an holye concell, as it hath bene in dede cōfeſſed of al good Chriſten men, Upō theſe two confeſſions I will declare the whole enterpriſe of this fifte boke to be ouerthrowen. Firſt to begyn with the councel of Nice, the ſame hath opened the myſterye of the Sacrament of the bodye and bloude of Chriſte in this wiſe, that Chriſten men beleue the lambe that taketh awaye the ſynnes of the worlde to be ſituate vpon gods borde, and to be ſacrificed of the Prieſtes, not after the maner of other Sacrifices. This is the doctrine of the councell of Nice, and muſt then be called an holy doctrine and therby a true doctrine, conſonante to the Scriptures, the foundacion of all truth. If thauctor will denye this to haue been the teachyng of the counſaill of Nice, I ſhal alleage therfore the allegacion of the ſame by Decolampadius, who beyng an aduerſarye to the truth, was yet by gods prouidence ordered to beare teſtimonie to the truth in this poynte, and by his meane, is publiſhed to the worlde in greke as foloweth, which neuerthleſſe may otherwiſe appeare to be true.

Ideo non multum accipimus, ſed parum, vt cognoſcamus quoniā non in ſatietatem, ſed ſanctificationem.

This holy Councell of Neece hath been

beleued vniuerſally in declaration of the myſterye of the Trinitie and the Sacramentes alſo. And

Why ſhoulde not all ſuche likewiſe beleue the ſame councell in explicacion of the Sacramentes, whiche to do, thauctor hath bound him ſelfe, grauntyng that councell holye. And then we muſte beleue the verye preſence of Chriſtes bodye and bloude on goddes borde, and that Prieſtes do their ſacrifice, and be therfore called ſacrificers. So as thoſe names, &amp; termes be to be honoured, and religiouſly ſpoken of, beyng in an holy councell vttered and confeſſed, becauſe it was ſo ſeen to them and the holye gooſt, without whoſe preſente aſſiſtynge and ſuggeſſion beleued to be there, the councel coulde not nor ought not to be called holy.

               For the other poynte in that thauctor approued the iudgement of Petrus Lombardus in the matter, what ſhoulde I more do, but wryte in the wordes of Petrus Lombardus as he hath them: which be theſe in the fourth booke the .xij.

whether that the prieſt doth, maye be ſayde properlie a ſacrifice or immolaciō: &amp; whether chriſt be daily īmolate or only ones?

This wryteth Petrus Lombardus, whoſe iudgement becauſe this auctor alloweth, he muſt grant that the viſible church hath Prieſtes in miniſtery that offre dayly, Chriſts moſt precius body &amp; bloud in myſterie, &amp; then muſt it be graunted that Chriſt ſo offered him ſelfe in his ſupper. For otherwiſe then he did cannot nowe be done. And by the iudgement of Petrus Lombardus, the ſame moſt precious body &amp; bloud is offered daylye that ones ſuffered and was ones

But to the purpoſe, if thauctor will ſtande to the iudgemēt of Petrus Lōbardus, al his ſift bookee of this

The Catholike doctrine reacheth not the dailie ſacrifice of Chriſtes moſt precious body and bloud to be an iteration of the ones perfited ſacrifice on the croſſe, but a ſacrifice that repreſenteth that ſacrifice, &amp; ſheweth it alſo before the faythful eyes &amp; refreſhyth the effectual memorie of it, ſo as in the dailie ſacrifice withowt weddyng of bloud, we may ſee with the eye of faith the very body &amp; bloud of Chriſt by gods mightie power, without diniſion diſtinctly exhibite, the ſame body &amp; bloud that ſuffered &amp; was ſhed for vs whiche is a liuely memorial to ſtir vppe our faith &amp; to cōſider brefly therin the great charitie

of God towardes vs declared in Chriſt. The Catholique doctrine teacheth the dailye ſacrifice to be the ſame in eſſence that was of fered on the Croſſe ones, aſſured thereof by Chriſtes wordes whē he ſaide: This is my body that ſhal be betrayed for you. The offring on the Croſſe was &amp; is propiciatorye &amp; ſatiſfactorie for our redēption &amp; remiſſiō of ſinne, wherby to deſtroye the tyrāny of ſinne, theffect wherof is geuen and diſpēſed in the ſacramēt of Baptiſme, ones likewiſe miniſtred &amp; neuer to be it erate, no more thē Chriſt can be crucified again, &amp; yet by vertue of the ſame offering ſuch as fal be reieued in the ſacramēt of penance. The daylie offering is propitiatorie alſo, but not in that degre of propitiatiō, as for redēption, regeneraciō, or remiſſion of deadlye ſinne which was ones purchaſſed, &amp; by force therof is in the ſacramērs miniſtred, but for the encrease of gods fauor, the mitigaciō of gods diſpleaſure prouoked by our infirmities, the ſubduyng of tēptacions &amp; the perfectiō of vertue in vs. All good workes, good thoughtes &amp; good meditacions may be called ſacrifices &amp; the ſame be called ſacrifices propitiatorie alſo, for ſo much as in ther degre god accepteth, and taketh them throughe the effecte and ſtrenghte of the verye Sacrifice of Chriſtes death, whiche is the reconciliacion betwene God and man, miniſtred &amp; diſpenſed particularlye as God hath appoynted, in ſuche meaſure as he knoweth. But Saincte

Paul to the Hebrues exortyng men to charitable Hebr. 13. deades ſaith, with ſuche ſacrifices God is made fauorable, or God is propitiate, if we ſhall make new Engliſhe. Wherupon it foloweth becauſe the Prieſte in the daylye Sacrifice doth as Chriſt hath ordered to be done for ſhewynge forthe and remembraunce of Chriſtes death, that acte of the Prieſt done accordynge to goddes commauudement muſt nedes be propitiatorye and prouoke goddes fauour, and ought to be truſted one, to haue a propitiatorye effecte with God to the membres of Chriſtes bodye, particularly, beynge the ſame done for the whole bodye in ſuche wiſe as God knoweth the diſpenſacion to be mette and conuenient, accordynge to whiche meaſure, God worketh moſt iuſtlye and moſt mercyfullye, otherwiſe then man can by his iudgement diſcuſſe and determine. To cal the daylye offeryng a Sacrifice ſatiſfactory muſt haue an vnderſtāding that ſignifieth not the actiō of the Prieſt but the preſence of Chriſts moſt precious body &amp; bloud the verye Sacrifice of the worlde ones perfytely offered being propiciatorie &amp; ſatiſfactorie for al the world, Or elles the worde (ſatiſfactorie) muſt haue a ſignificaciō &amp; meanyng, as it hath ſometyme that declareth thacceptiō of the thynge done, &amp; not the propre contreuaile of thactiō, after which ſorte man maye ſatiſfie God that is ſo mercifull as he will take in good worthe for Chriſtes ſake mannes imperfite endeuor, &amp; ſo

the dailie offeryng may be called a ſacrifice ſatiſfactorie, becauſe God is pleaſed with it beynge a maner of worſhipping of Chriſtes paſſiō accordyng to Chriſtes inſtitutiō. But otherwiſe the dailie ſacrifice in reſpect of the actiō of the prieſt can not be called ſatiſfactorye, and it is a worde in dede that ſoundeth not well ſo placed, althowgh it might be ſaued by a ſignification, &amp; therfore thinke that worde rather to be well expounded, thē by captius vnderſtādyng brought in ſlander whē it is vſed, and this ſpeache to be frequentide that thonlie immolaciō of Chriſt in him ſelfe vpon thaulter of the Croſſe is the very ſatiſfactorye Sacrifice for reconciliacion of man kynde to the fauor of God. And I haue not red, the daylye ſacrifice of Chriſtes moſt precious body to be called a ſacrifice ſatiſfactorye, but this ſpeache hath in dede bene vſed, that the Prieſt ſhoulde ſynge ſatiſfactorye, whiche they vnderſtande in the ſatiſfaction of the Prieſtes duetye, to attend the prayer he was required to make, and for a diſtinctiō thereof they had prayer ſometime required without ſpeciall limitacion &amp; that was called to praye not ſatiſfactorye. Finally man by eny his action to preſume to ſatiſfie God by waye of counteruail is a verye mad &amp; furiouſe blaſphemie. Where the auctor citynge S. Paul engliſheth him thus, that Chriſtes Hebr. 7. Prieſthode cannot paſſe frō him to an other. This wordes thus framed be not the ſimple

&amp; ſincere expreſſion of the trueth of the texte. Whiche ſayth that Chriſt hath a perpetuall Prieaſthode, and the greke hathe a worde (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ) whiche the greke ſcholes expreſſe &amp; exponde by the worde (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ) ſignifiyng the Prieſthode of Chriſte endeth not in him to go to an other by ſucceſſion as in the tribe of leui, where was among mortall men ſucceſſion in thoffice of Prieſthode, but Chriſte lyueth euer, &amp; therfore is a perpetuall euerlaſtyng Prieſt, by whoſe auctoritie Prieſthode is now in this viſible Churche as S. Paule 1. Tim. 4. et ad Titū. 1. ordred to Timothe &amp; Tite, and other places alſo confirme, whiche Prieſtes viſible miniſters to our inuiſible Prieſte offer the daylye Sacrifice in Chriſtes churche, that is to ſaye with the very preſence by goddes omnipotē
                  cye wrought of the moſt precious bodye and bloud of our ſauiour Chriſt ſhewynge forth Chriſtes death &amp; celebratyng the memory of his ſupper and death accordinge to Chriſtes inſtitucion ſo with daylie oblacion &amp; ſacrifice of the ſelfe ſame Sacrifice to kendle in vs a thankfull remembrance of all Chriſtes benefittes vnto vs. And where thauctor woulde auoyde all the teſtimonye of the fathers by preſence yt ſhould be but a maner of ſpeach, the Canon of the Councell of Nice before reherſed and the wordes of it, where myſteries be ſpoken of in propre termes for doctrine, auoydeth all that ſhifte and it hath no abſurditie to confeſſe that Chriſt in his ſupper did

inſtitute for a remēbrance of the only ſacrifice the preſence of the moſt precious ſubſtāce to be (as the Canon of the concell in propre termes teacheth) ſacrificed by the Prieſtes to be the pure ſacrifice of the church ther offred for the effect of thencreaſe of life in vs, as it was offered on the Croſſe to atcheue life vnto vs. And S. Cyrill who for his doctrine was in Epiſtola ad Neſtor. greate auctoritie with the counſell Epheſme, wryteth the very body and bloud of Chriſt to be the liuely and vnbloudy Sacrifice of the churche, as likewiſe in tholde churche other commenly termed the ſame and among other Chriſoſtome whō thauctor would now haue 1

                     . hom. ad Heb. ſeme to vſe it but for a maner of ſpeach, which in dede Chriſoſtome doth not, but doth truly open, thunderſtanding of that is done in the church, wherin by this ſacrifice done after the ordre of Melchiſedech, Chriſtes death is not iterate but a memorie daylie renewed of that death, ſo as Chriſtes offerynge on the Croſſe ones done &amp; cōſummate to finiſh all ſacrifices after thordre of Aaron, is now only remembred accordyng to Chriſtes inſtituciō but in ſuch wiſe as the ſame bodie is offred dailie on thalter that was ones offred on thalter of the Croſſe, but the ſame maner of offeryng is not daylie, that was on thaulter of the croſſe, for the dayly offeryng is without bloudſhed &amp; is termed ſo to ſignifie that bloud ſheding ones done to be ſufficiēt. And as Chryyoſtome openeth it by declaracion of what maner our ſacrifice

is, that is to ſay, this daylie offering to be a remēbrāce of the other maner of ſacrifice ones done, &amp; therfore ſayth rather we make a remēbrance of it: This ſayng of Chryſoſtome doth not empayre his former words wher he ſaith, the hoſt is the ſame offred on the croſſe and on thalter, &amp; therfore by him the body of Chriſt that dyed but ones is daylie preſent in dede, &amp; (as the Concel of Nice ſaith) ſacrificed not after the maner of other Sacrifices &amp; (as Chriſoſtom ſaith) offred, but the death of that preciouſe body onely dayly remēbred &amp; not againe iterate. And wher thauctor ſaith thold fathers callyng the ſupper of our. Lorde a ſacrifice, ment a Sacrifice of laude &amp; thākes geuyng. Hippinus of Hambrough no Papiſt, in his boke dedicate to the kynges Maieſtye that now is, ſaith otherwiſe and noteth how the olde fathers called it a Sacrifice propiciatorye, for the very preſence of Chriſtes mooſt precious body ther (thus ſaith he) which preſence all Chriſten men muſte ſaye requireth on oure parte laudes and thankes geuynge, whiche maye be and is called in Scripture by the name of Sacrifice, but that Sacrifice of our laudes and thankes geuynge cannot be a Sacrifice geuyng life, as it is noted by Cyril the ſacrifice of the church to do, when he ſaith it is (viuificū) which can be onely ſayde of the verye bodye and bloud of Chriſt. Nor oure Sacrifice of laudes and thankes geuynge cannot be ſayde, a pure and cleane Sacrifice

wherby to fulfill the prophecie of Malachie, Malac. 3. and therfore the ſame prophecie was in the begynning of the Churche vnderſtanded to be ſpoken of the daylye offeryng of the bodye and bloud of Chriſt for the memorye of Chriſtes death accordyng to Chriſtes ordinaunce in his ſupper, as maye at more lenght be opened &amp; declared. Thinkyng to theffecte of this booke ſufficient to haue encountred the chefe poyntes of thauctors doctrine with ſuch contradiction to them as the Catholique doctrine doth of neceſſitie require, the more particulare confutacion of that is vntrue of thaduerſarie parte, and confirm aciō of that is true in the Catholique doctrine, requiryng more time and ley ſure then I haue nowe, and therfore offerynge my ſelfe readye by mouth or wryte to ſay further in this matter as inalbe required: I ſhall here ende for this tyme, with prayour to almightye God to graunte his truth, to be acknowledged &amp; confeſſed, and vniſormely to be preached and beleued of al, ſo as all contencion for vnderſtandyng of religion auoyded whiche hyndreth Charitie, we maye geue ſuche light abrode as men may ſee our good workes and glorifie our father, who is in heauē with the ſonne and holy goſt in one vnitie of godhed reignyng without ende.
            
            Amen.
