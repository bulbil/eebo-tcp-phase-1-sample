            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            TO THE WORSHIPFVLL MY LOVING COSENS, Mr. IOHN SCVDAMORE of Kenchurch in Hereford-shire, and Mrs ELIZABETH SCVDAMORE his Wife, many happy daies together, with all true Blessednes, both temporall and eternall.
            
               RIght deere, and vnfeinedly beloued in Christ Jesus, I haue a long time much desired some good occasion of testifying mine hearty affection to your selues in particular among others of

that Familie, which I acknowledge my selfe so deeply indebted vnto. And I seeme now at length to haue lighted on that, that I haue so long longed for. Being to publish a wedding Sermō
                of a worthy Friend deceased, (which Mr. W. Br. I wish, if Gods good will had so beene, he had liued to doe himselfe) containing matter concerning the holy disposition &amp; Christian managing of Mariage Feasts; I thought good to adioyne to it (being it selfe but short) some Meditations of mine owne, of somewhat a neere subiect, the occasion of such Feasts, to wit, A good Wife, by Salomon said to be Gods Gift. That which here I addresse vnto you, as to remaine a Monument of mine hearty wel-wishing vnto you, so to abide by you, as a Monitor to put you both in minde, what a blessing of God

you enjoy either in other, and what cause you haue to be thankefull to him either for other. Since it pleased God by his prouidence and your Friends agreement to bring you together, and to knit that sacred knot betweene you, I haue not yet bin so happy, as to be an eie-witnes of your Christian and religious cohabitation &amp; conversation: but haue by many beene informed of it, to my great ioy, that you tread both in the steps of your pious Parents, and therein shew your selues to be their Children, Rom 9. 3. not according to the flesh onely, but (which would haue bin their greatest comfort, had they suruiued to haue seene it, and shall be your chiefest happines both here and hereafter) according to the promise, euen of eternall saluation, annexed to the gratious Couenant of

Faith in Christ; which by your godly practise you shew your selues to haue common interest in with them. And indeed to speake in the Holy Ghosts language, then Eorum filij dicimur, quorum actus imitamur. Origen. in Ezech. hom. 4. &amp; Greg. Rom. mor. lib. 20. cap. 17. are we truly the Children of our religious Parents and Ancestors, when in goodnes and godlines we take after those that we come of. Job. 8. 39.

            For the former; Vers. 13. 
               A foolish sonne, saith Salomon, is his Fathers sorrow: and a brawling wife is as a continuall dropping.

then somewhat also it must needs be for a man to want such, and much more for a man to haue them that dwell neere him euill-affected toward him. An euill at the next doore may be bad enough, and may proue ouer troublesome; an euill within doores, at home, in a mans owne house much more.

So that it maketh a man at his wits end, vncertaine whether it be better for him to be abroad in the raine, or to bide within doores in the dropping.

God chargeth his people not to make matches betweene their children and the Canaanites, either by giuing their daughters vnto the sonnes of the Canaanites, or by taking the Canaanites daughters vnto their sonnes: which he would not doe, were not they at all to deale in the disposing of them. And many, no doubt, would they

take aduice of their Parents, and not follow their owne fancies, and make their wanton eye, or their wandring lust, their choser and counsailer in such cases, might doe much better than for want hereof they doe.
            But the meaning of Salomon is this only, that the one is a more speciall gift of God than the other; that there is a more speciall hand of God in the one than in the other. As that is a lesse benefit than this: so that is in mans power more than this.

            It was one of the first reall and royall gifts that Genes. 2. 22. God with his owne hand bestowed vpon Adam. And it must needs bee no small matter that God giueth with his owne hand. The Kings Almoner may cast small siluer about: but if the King giue a man somewhat with his owne hand out of his purse or pocket, it is expected it should be a peece of gold at least. The woman was Gods owne gift to Adam. And shee was Gods gift bestowed on him, Genes. 2. 18. to consummate and make vp his happinesse. Though he were at the first of himselfe happie, yet

not so happie as hee might be, vntill hee had one to partake with him in his happinesse.
            It was God that at first gaue Adam his wife; and it is God that giueth euerie man his wife to this Reason 2. day. Genes. 24. 7, 56. 
               God, saith Abraham to his seruant, will send his Angell along with thee, and will prosper thee in thy iourney; when he sent him about a wife for his Son Isaak. And Matth. 19. 6.

            For the latter; There is a more speciall prouidence of God in a Wife than in Wealth. Humane wisdome Point 2. and fore-cast, endeuour and industrie, may strike a greater stroke, and haue a more speciall hand in the one than in the other. Men of wealth may leaue their heires land and liuing; but

            For first, they may bee deceiued in their choise. Many haue good skill in chusing of wares, in valuing of lands, in beating a bargaine, in making a purchase, that are yet but blinde buzzards in the choise of a wife. Yea the wisest that are may bee soone here ouer-reached. Since all is not gold, as

A Father may finde out a fit wife, and thinke such a one a meet match for his Sonne: and her Parents may be also of the same minde with him, as willing to entertaine the motion as hee is to make it; and yet it may be, when they haue done all they can, they cannot fasten their affections.

               If the root, saith hee, be holy, the branches also bee holy: and, If the branches, say I, be holy, then the root that beareth them much more. So here, If the branches bee blessed, the root that beareth them much more. If Children bee a Blessing, then

And how do maried persons then stand engaged to God aboue others, whom he hath blessed in their choise? A great measure of thankfulnesse owe they vnto him, proportionable in some sort to the blessing bestowed on them.
            Yea, as there is a greater measure of thankfulnesse

required of them, than of others whom God hath not blessed in that manner: so there is a peculiar kinde of thankfulnesse required on their part. All Gods fauours require thankfulnesse: and the more fauours the more thankfulnesse: but some speciall fauours require some peculiar kinde of acknowledgement, proportioned to the qualitie of the fauor receiued. Psal.

Children are Gods gift: and our thankfulnesse to him for them is to be shewed in such duties, as hee requireth of vs in the behalfe of them, Ephes. 6. 4. in the carefull education and training them vp in good courses. In like manner: Thy Wife thou hast of Gods gift: and thy thankfulnesse to him for her, must be shewed in the performance of such duties, as he requireth of thee in regard of her Ephes. 5. 25, 28, 29, 33. Coloss. 3. 19. Vse 10., as of loue, of kindnesse, of concord, counsell, contentment, &amp;c.
            Fiftly, Is the Wife giuen vnto her Husband by God? then must she resolue to giue herselfe wholly to him as her Owner, on whom God hath bestowed her, to whom hee hath assigned her. When Parents haue put out their Children, the Children must bee content to bee guided by those to whom they commit them: and when God hath giuen a Daughter, she must be content to liue with him, and be guided by him, whom God hath giuen her vnto. Neither is she to forsake him. For Matth. 19. 5, 6. they are not to bee sundred, nor seuered, whom God hath conioyned and made one. And there is a foule brand therfore vpon her, Prov. 2. 17. 
               that for saketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the Couenant of her God. Nor to refuse to be ruled by him: but Ephes. 5. 22. 1 Pet. 3. 1. 
               submit and subiect herselfe vnto him, vnto whom God hath giuen her: for

            In a word, let both man and wife so esteeme either of other, as joyned by Gods counsell, as giuen by Gods hand; and so receiue either other as from God, bee thankfull either for other vnto God, seeke the good either of other in God; and then will God vndoubtedly with his blessing, accompanie his gift to his owne glorie, and their mutuall good.

Whereunto hauing yeelded, I knew not which way better to direct it than to your selues; ut whose happy conjunction some part of it was preached, the residue through streits of time being for that time suppressed. What then you should haue heard, if the time had permitted, both your selues may now reade (if you please) with some further enlargement, and others also (if they thinke it may be of vse to them) vnder your Names. Therein, as in a Glasse, as you, Worthy MADAM, may (I doubtnot) see your selfe liuely deciphered; so you, Blessed SIR, yea thrice blessed in this your happy choise, might learne, but that (I know) you are not now to learne it, what a pretious Iewell God hath in her bestowed on you, and how great a measure of thankfulnesse you owe to him for his mercy to you therein. Yea both of you may behold here, what a blessed estate and condition of life it is, that GOD hath pleased to call you vnto, where the same is managed through his grace according to his will; notwithstanding those vile and foule aspersions here in part

laid open, that those of that Romish faction are wont to cast vpon it. If of those that abuse this holy and diuine Ordinance, and carry themselues otherwise therein than they ought, there seeme to any a Censure ouer-harsh here to be passed; Let them consider that it is no other than Gods word giueth good warrant for; and let them take heed, lest by censuring it, they giue suspition that themselues come within compasse of such Censure. To your selues (I am assured) no Apology shall need either for it, or mine addressing it to you. But hoping it will be accepted, as it is intended, as a testimonie of my sincere and intire affection to you both; with hearty prayers to GOD for your happy cohabitation to be long continued to his greater glory, your mutuall comfort, and the further benefit of those that may haue dependance vpon you: I commend you to

               Salomon here saith? yea, doth not the same Salomon himselfe elsewhere say, that some Wife there is, Prov. 14. 1. that pulleth downe the house? that is, not as a corrosiue at her Husbands sides, but Prov. 12. 4. 
               as corruption in his bones? or Prov. 19. 13. &amp; 27. 15. 
               like a continuall dropping in a rainie day, that maketh a man wearie of his home, and either driueth him out of doores, or will not suffer him to rest within? And that Prov. 21. 9. 
               it is better for a man to dwell on the house top, exposed to wind and weather; or Prov. 21. 19. 
               to liue in the wildernesse 
               Sirac. 25. 20. 
               among wilde

beasts, than to keepe house with such an one.
            To this there are diuers answers giuen. Answer. Solution 1.

            But this seemeth scarce sound.
            For first, it were but a verie sorrie commendation of a Wife, to say, Better such an one than none at all.

            Againe, when Salomon saith, that Prov. 21. 9.

               Sophocles saith of some friends) it is much better to be without her than with her; to liue solitarie, than to liue with such.
            Secondly, the answer of some others is, that M. Cope on the Prouerbs. 
               Salomon speaketh this in regard of the end for which the

woman was made, and for which God gaue her, which was Genes. 2. 18. Reiection. Exception 1. 
               for mans good.
            
            But neither doth this satisfie.
            For first, Salomon seemeth to speake here rather of the fruit and benefit that commeth by a Wife, where she is such as she should be, than of the bare end for which she was made, or is giuen: And greater is Exception 2. 
               the euill, if being made and giuen for such an end, she proue contrarie thereunto.

            Thirdly, others answer, (and their answer is more probable) that it is Piscat. in Proc. Synecdoche Generis pro specie. a Synecdoche, a putting of the generall for the speciall; or Mercer in Prov. an Ellipsis, a defectiue speech; that there wanteth the word good: as Esai. 1. 11.

            As well therefore may a wart, or a wen, or a wolfe, or a cancer bee termed a part of the bodie, as that woman be termed a Wife, that is but a blemish, as a wart; or a burden, as a wen; or a continuall heart-sore, as a wolfe; or corruption and rottennesse, as a cancer or a gangreane, in the bones of him that hath her. And no maruell then, if a bad Wife bee not accounted with God as a Wife, when shee is (not onely as good as, but) farre worse than no Wife; when it is so much better to be without her, than with her.

               conscience sake be subiect to the froward as well as the courteous. So must thou doe the dutie of an Husband as well to a bad as to a good Wife, for conscience of Gods command. Doe thou thy dutie for God, and thou shalt haue thy reward from God. As our Sauiour saith Luk. 14. 14. of those that relieue the poore, though they cannot requite them, yet God will reward them; so though she doe not with kindnesse answer thee, God will requite thee, in the Resurrection of the Righteous.

He doth not say, I will make him a wife: or, I will make him a woman, that may be an Helpe to him: though hee meant so to doe: but, I will make him an Helpe. So that A wife is a Woman ioyned to Man to be an Helpe to him: And for a Woman to be a Wife, is to be an Help to her Husband. But wherein to be an Helpe?

               wilde beasts are wont to doe. They are no better at all in Gods sight than such: and they must looke one day to answer, not onely for the wrong that they doe either to other, but for the wrong also that they doe vnto God and his ordinance, by bringing through their fault a foule imputation vpon it.

               e Light of Nature alone, yet haue admired the excellencie of this diuine Ordinance, and haue worthily preferred it before all other externall and temporal Blessings whatsoeuer.
            Now the due Consideration hereof may well serue;
            First to controll those of the Church of Rome, who labour so by all meanes to vilifie, depresse and debase this Diuine Ordinance, as if they stroue who should cast most mucke, and durt, and dung, and filth in the face of it. Nothing is more odious and contumelious among them than the Name of a Wife, or a Wiued Person in some. The Name of a Concubine (as wee shall shew) is more acceptable with them, and more gratious in their Eyes.

               their Bishops and Archdeacons that make Priests mariage so vnsauourie, and compell them to leaue their Wiues, are yet so leacherously giuen themselues, that they neither abhorre or forbeare adulterie, no, nor incest, nor Sodomie. But one Instance more of their Iniquitie in this kinde shall suffice.

            Such a Wife then must be sought.

               Naomi telleth Ruth her Daughter in Law, that shee will seeke out some fit match for her.
            There is good Reason to seeke such an one in two Respects:
            
            First in regard of the Rarity, the Difficulty. Because such are not easily found.

            Secondly, by vsing the helpe and taking the aduice of Friends. A course especially to be embraced and entertained of those that are themselues vnexperienced, or that are yet vnder the power of others. So did Genes. 28. 2, 5. &amp; 29. 18.

            Thirdly, by seeking vnto those that are the Parents or Gouernours of such as they affect or desire, being yet vnder the power of such. So did Genes. 24. 48, 49. 
               Abrahams Seruant deale with the Friends of Rebekka. And

               Gen. 34. 4, 6, 8.

               Meanes 4. 
               God. As did Gen. 24. 12, 14.

               Isaak did when hee dismissed his Sonne Iacob with Instructions and charge what course to take concerning a Wife.
            
            For (and so passe we to the next Point) God is the principall Doner here. He that will finde a Wife, saith Salomon, must obtaine her of God. And, Prov. 19. 14. 
               House and inheritance are of the Fathers; but

               a prudent Wife is of God. From God therefore it is that a Good Wife must be had. And no maruell.
            For first,

            Secondly, Psal. 127. 4. 
               Children, saith the Psalmist, and the fruit of the wombe is Gods Gift. And, Iosh. 24. 3, 5. 
               I gaue Abraham Isaak; and Isaak Iacob and Esau, saith God by Ioshua. And, Genes. 33. 5. Reason 3. 
               They be the Children that God hath giuen me; saith Iacob to Esau. If Children be his gift, the Wife is much more. Neither can we haue them without her; not her without Him.
            
            Thirdly, Euery good Woman is Gods Daughter: as Luke 3. 38. 
               Adam is said to be Gods Sonne: 
               2 Cor. 6. 18. 
               You shall be my Sonnes, and my Daughters; saith God. He hath a speciall interest, more than ordinary, in them: and they cannot therefore be had without him.

But as Prov. 21. 1. 
               the Kings Heart; so Solus Rex mentium Deus. Aug. in Ioan. 
               the hearts of all Men and Women are in Gods hand. As Psal. 33. 15. 
               he made them all, and Acts 15. 9. &amp; 1. 24. 1 King. 8. 39. 
               hee alone knoweth and Psal. 33. 15. 
               vnderstandeth them all; so Ezra 7. 27, 28. Nehem. 1. 11. Psal. 106. 46. he windeth and turneth them all which way he will, nor can any win or winde the Heart of any contrary to his will.
            
            Now, as such a Wife is of God; so (which was the last Particular)
            
            
               It is a speciall fauour of God for any Man to obtaine such an one.
            
            As Prov. 8. 35. 
               the Man that getteth Wisdome; so the Man that getteth a Wife, 
               Prov. 19. 14. 
               a wise Woman, (for there is

            Fiftly, Is such a Wife a speciall Fauour of God? Then be carefull to reconcile thy selfe in the first place vnto God, if thou wouldest hope, or doest dedesire to haue such a speciall fauour at his hands. If thou desirest a Mans Daughter, thou wilt seeke to get her Fathers good-will: And if there haue beene any breach formerly betweene thee and him, thou wilt

vse all good meanes of working an accord and agreement betweene you, ere thou wilt come to make suit to him, to bestow his Daughter vpon thee. For little hope couldest thou haue to preuaile with him in a suit of that nature, Legantur quae de Scipionis filia Tib. Graccho desponsa Liv. hist. l. 18. Val. Max. l. 4. c. 2. &amp; Gell. noct.

            Lastly, let such maried persons as God hath blessed in this kinde, learne hence what cause they haue to be thankfull to God either for other. Yea let the jarres and discord that they see betweene other Men and Women mismatched, and the crosse and cursed cariage of them either toward other, together with the manifold annoiances and grieuous mischiefes and inconueniences that ensue ordinarily thereupon, be a meanes to put them in mind of Gods great mercie and goodnesse to them, and of his speciall fauour towards them; and to make them the more thankfull vnto him for the same.
            And since that they haue receiued either other from God, let them herein striue to shew their thankfulnesse vnto God, by endeuouring to bring either other neerer vnto God, by Hebr. 12. 24.
