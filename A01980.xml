            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                  The Hiſtory of a penitent Renegado.
               THis Penitent heere before you, Vincent Iukes by name, is an Engliſh man, borne in Shropſhiere, and in the ſeventeenth yeare of his age was bound apprentice to a Cooke in Ratlife of this Parish. After two yeares ſervice, his maſter ſet him forth to Sea in a Cooks place in the Adventure for Greeneland. Thither they had a proſperous voyage, and returned ſafe within five moneths. 
                  Anno 1636. The yeare following hee was ſet foorth againe (as before) for Genoway. In this voyage they were ſet upon by Turkish pirats, and after a dangerous ſight, wherein ſeven were ſlaine and about twenty more wounded and maimed, hee with three and thirty more were carried to Argier, where, within foure daies after their arrivall, they were ſold for ſlaves in the Market place. Of that company many died, foure were ranſom'd, and ſeven there ſtill abide in ſlaverie. It is a cuſtome there that their King have his choice of every eighth perſon to bee ſold. And it ſo fell out that

this man was one of the eight. The King therefore had him for his ſlave, and after two moneths paſſed him over to his brother; by whom hee was ſold to a Negro. That Negro uſed him moſt cruelly: and by daily threatnings and ſoare beatings forced him to renounce his Chriſtian Religion, denie Chriſt, acknowledge Mahomet to bee a great Prophet, and in teſtimony thereof to bee circumciſed and to conforme himſelfe to the Turkiſh rites, and attire. All theſe things thus accompliſhed, the Negro ſold him to a Grecian, who was alſo a Mahometan. This Grecian put him for a Souldier into a Turkiſh ſhip, which went forth upon ſpoile. In that ſhip were two Engliſh Chriſtians and a Flemming Circumciſed as himſelfe, with twenty native Turks. The two Chriſtians and two Renegadoes being together in the ſterridge, eſpied five of the Turks alone together below board: and thereupon conſulted to take that opportunity 
                  •
               f freeing themſelves from ſlavery, or ſpending their lives in the attempt thereof.

Thus on a ſudden they fly upon thoſe five Turks, who ſuſpected no ſuch matter, and with their knives, having no other weapons, ſtab'd them. This done, they ſeiſed upon the muskets, ſwords and other weapons which were in that roome, and therewith kild five more of the Turks that came one after another to ſee what the tumult might be about: and they wounded and maimed five more. The five Turks that remained alive unwounded were ſo affrighted, as they knew not what to doe, but through feare ran up to the riggin: where they were threatned to be ſhot thorow if they would not yeald. They yeald therefore upon promiſe to have their lives ſpared; and comming downe one by one were bound, as the five maimed Turks were. Thus a full conqueſt being got over all thoſe Turks they ſailed to S. Lucas in Spaine, where the Conquerours ſold the ten living Turks, the ſhip and all that was in her for ſix hundred pounds, which they devided among themſelves, and had each of them an hundred and fifty pound apeece.
            
               The Spaniards dealt fairely with the foure that now profeſſed themſelves Chriſtians: and uſed all the enducements they could to bring them to their Religion: Three of them were perſwaded, and abode among the Spaniards. This Penitent bearing more love to his native Country and reformed Religion in which hee had beene brought up, refuſed to abide in Spaine, but tooke his firſt opportunity of comming for England in the Centurian 
               1638. the laſt of Aprill. Hee had not beene long in England before hee put to Sea againe for Greeneland. In which voyage hee profeſſeth that hee was much troubled night and day, and that hee could not well ſleepe through horrour of conſcience for denying his Chriſtian Faith. So ſoone therefore as hee returned ſafe from Greeneland to England, hee went to the ancient grave Cura
                     •
                  e of Stepny, the Pariſh where hee lived, and made knowne his caſe to him; who for the preſent comforted and

exhorted him to abide more ſtedfaſt in the true Faith for the future. But becauſe the caſe was no ordinary caſe, the ſaid Curate very prudently adviſed with the reverend Doctor, and Vicar of that Church. The Doctor on the ſame ground, and with like prudence made his caſe knowne to the right honourable and right reverend Father in GOD his Dioceſan; who adviſed with the moſt reverend Father in GOD the Lord Arch-Biſhop of Canterbury his Grace thereabout.
            Thus was there a ſolemne, pious, and grave forme of Penance preſcribed for admitting him againe into the Chriſtian Church. At the performance whereof this duty of preaching the Word was enjoyned to mee: Which in obedience to Authority, and with hope in GODS aſſiſtance I have undertaken. And that what on this occaſion I ſhall deliver may bee both ſeaſonable and profitable, I have made choiſe of the Text which you heard before; And I pray, heare it againe,

            2. In the ſecond, the Prodigall being brought to extreame want, is forced to ſeeke ſervice of an hard maſter: under whom he was put to a baſe worke: and yet for his paines had not enough to ſuſtaine nature, ver. 14, 15, 16.
            3. In the third, the ſaid Prodigall is brought to himſelfe, and to thinke of his Father: to whom addreſſing himſelfe, he is met in the midd way by his Father: and gratiouſly embraced upon his penitent confeſſion, ver. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.
            4. In the fourth, his Father with all the cheerefull and joyfull expreſſions that he can, brings him to his houſe, clothes him with the beſt robe, feaſts him, and cheares him with muſick and dancing, ver. 22, 23, 24.
            
               5. In the fifth, the elder Brother hearing the melodie, and enquiring after the cauſe, enviouſly expoſtulates the caſe with his Father: but the Father gratiouſly endeavours to give him full ſatisfaction: wherein he concludes with the words of my Text,
He was loſt, and is found.
            
            Theſe five Parts might eaſily be ſubdivided into ſundry other particulars.
            But having by the forenamed generalls brought you along from the beginning of the Parable to the laſt clauſe thereof, my purpoſe is to hold cloſe to this cloſe, He was loſt, and is found.

                  Summe and parts of the Text.
               
            
            The particulars moſt obſervable are two.
            1. The Dammage of Apoſtacy, He was loſt. For when he went out of his Fathers houſe he proved an Apoſtate. His Fathers houſe was the Church, wherein alone were the meanes of ſalvation: and out of which he had no hope of ſalvation, but was in that broad way that leadeth to deſtruction. Thus was he filius perditus, a loſt child. A great dammage indeed was this.
            2. The Advantage of Penitency. He is found. By ſight and ſence of his ſinne, by an humble acknowledgement thereof, and by returning to his Fathershouſe, he ſhewed himſelfe a true Penitent: and by his Fathers receiving

him into his houſe, and giving him ſuch wellcome as he did, he was under the meanes of ſalvation againe. Thus was he filius inventus. A child whom his Father enjoyed. As great an advantage was this to the Sonne, as joy to the Father.

                      turning to the worſe, and to the better.
               Before I proceed in a diſtinct handling of theſe two particulars, I suppoſe it to be meet to ſet before you a generall view of the whole: and that as it conſiſts of two oppoſite termes, LOST, FOVND; but made to agree by two different tences or times, WAS, IS. He WAS loſt, and IS found.
            
            
               He WAS, He IS; Theſe are the two diſtinct and different times.
            The former, He WAS, notes out the time paſt: and that was his fore-lorne eſtate.
            The latter, He IS, points at the time preſent: and that is his new-borne eſtate.
            Thus he is here ſet out unto us, not in that condition which the Prophet deſcribeth in theſe words,Ezek. 18.24. 
               When the righteous turneth away from his righteouſneſſe, and committeth iniquity, and doth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doth, ſhall he live? All his righteouſneſſe that he hath done ſhall not be mentioned. In his treſpaſſe that he hath treſpaſſed, and in his ſinne that he hath ſinned, in them ſhall he die. But he is ſet out in a more bleſſed condition, which the ſame Prophet thus deſcribeth,Ezek. 18.21. 
               If the wicked will turne from all his ſinnes that he hath committed, and keepe all my ſtatutes, and doe

that which is lawfull and right, h
                     •
                   ſhall ſurely live: he ſhall not die.
            
            If the termes of my Text had beene thus changed, He was found, and is loſt, it had beene more miſerable then, fuimus Troes, wee were a flouriſhing people: or then,

               How doth the Citie ſit ſolitary that was full of people? In ſuch a caſe, miſerum eſt fuiſſe, it is a miſerable thing to have beene: to have beene in our Fathers houſe, and to be loſt: as, to have beene living and to be dead. But as the parts of the Propoſition ſtand in my Text, He was loſt, and is found, meminiſſe juvabit, it will be a comfort to conſider that ſuch and ſuch a woefull eſtate is altered: that He was loſt, and is found. It is like to that comfort which he found in his ſoule, who ſaid, I was a blaſphemer, and a perſecutor, and injurious,
               1 Tim. 1.13. 
               but I have obtained mercy. Hereupon with much content and comfort he ſaith (1 Cor. 15.10.) By the grace of God I am that I am.
            
            To ſhew that ſuch a paſſage from the worſe to the better is remarkable, and not to be forgotten, the Apoſtle adviſeth the converted Gentiles to remember it Remember that yee being in time paſſed Gentiles in the fleſh:
               Epheſ. 2.11, 12, 13. — That at that time yee were without Chriſt:— But now in Chriſt Ieſus, yee who ſometimes were farre off are made nigh by the blood of Chriſt.
            
            This was the caſe of the penitent Prodigall, He was lost, and is found. And this is the caſe

of the Penitent Renegado here before us. He was loſt,
               
                  When the Renegado was loſt.
                
               and is found. He was loſt, not when he firſt ſet to ſea: nor when the Turkiſh Pirats ſet upon the ſhip wherein he was: nor when they took him captive: nor when they ſold him for a ſlave: nor when he was under the harſh and hard handling of the cruell Negro. The baſeſt ſlave that can be under man, beleeving in Chriſt, and faſt-holding his Chriſtian faith, is (to uſe the Apoſtles phraſe, (1 Cor. 7.22.) the Lords freeman. Therfore not loſt. He that endureth whatſoever the cruelleſt perſecutor can inflict upon him for Chriſts ſake, is bleſſed, Mat. 5.11. Therefore not lost.
            
            But he was loſt when he became a Renegado: When he renounced his Chriſtian faith: when he acknowledged Mahomet to be the great Prophet; when he yeelded to be circumciſed, and have all his haire ſhaved off, and to put on Turkiſh attire, and when he profeſſed himſelfe a Mahometan, then He was loſt.
            
            Had he not yeelded to thoſe evidences of a Renegado,
               
                  No ſin per force
                but that per force they had been put upon him, he had not beene loſt. If per force he had beene circumciſed, if per force he had beene ſhaven, if per force the Turkiſh turbant or tuffe had been put upon his head, and other Turkiſh attire upon his body, he had not thereupon beene loſt.

               In this caſe circumciſion it ſelfe as it availeth nothing, ſo it doth no hurt. Circumciſion was of old, before Chriſt was exhibited, an honourable Cognizance wherby Gods people were diſtinguiſhed

from ſuch as were extranei, out of the covenant and in contempt called uncircumciſed (1 Sam. 14.6. and 17.26, 36. Epheſ. 2.11.) But by Chriſt,

                who pulled downe the partition wall beetwixt Iew and Gentile, was that, (as other rites of that uſe, which were alſo Types of the Meſsiah to come) utterly aboliſhed. On which ground ſaith the Apoſtle (Gal. 5.2.) If yee be circumciſed Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing, that is, If any revive that rite, which (beſide that it was a ſigne of difference betwixt Jew and Gentile, and a bond to tie men to the whole Law) was a Type of the Meſsiah to come, he denies Chriſt to be exhibited, and to have wrought mans redemption: and in that reſpect Chriſt ſhall profit him nothing.
            Now becauſe Christians, on theſe and other weighty grounds, utterly reject Circumciſion, Iewes, Turkes, and other adverſaries of the Chriſtian faith, are not onely circumciſed themſelves, but doe what lieth in them to draw ſuch Chriſtians as they can get into their clutches, to be circumciſed.

                as of old it was to offer incenſe to the Heatheniſh Idols: which becauſe Origen did, he was excommunicated by the Church. Not feare of torture and torments moved Origen to doe what he did (for thoſe he had oft endured in great meaſure

with much patience: ſo as his adverſaries ſaw that there was no working on him that way) but it was pretence of avoiding another ſinne.

For the Commiſſioner, when he diſcerned that by inflicting torments he nought prevailed, but was vanquiſhed, he turned himſelfe to a more diveliſh plot; for underſtanding how much Origen was addicted to preſerve the chaſtity of his body, hee brought him to the Idols altar where a filthy Black-more was placed, and threatned, that, if he would not offer incenſe on that altar the Black-more ſhould defile his body, which filthineſſe to prevent, he offered the incenſe. This pretence did not excuſe his fact, nor avert the Churches cenſure. What the Black-more had done per force to him, would have beene accounted no ſinne of his. But his offe
                  •
               ing of the incenſe was accounted a deniall of the Chriſtian faith.
            
               Renegadoes that yeeld to be circumciſed goe as farre, (yea and further too) in denying Chriſt, as Origen did, yet have they not ſuch a pretence as he. Not unjuſtly therefore may they be accounted loſt, as was this Penitent here before us.
            Yet his ſtanding here before us, as yee ſee him, gives evidence that he is found.
            
            He was not found when he with his fellowes ſlue ſome of the Turks in the ſhip:
                  When a Penitent i

                nor when they brought ſhip and the other Turks to Saint Lucas and there ſold them: nor when he arrived in England his native Countrey againe.

Though theſe were ſure evidences of his freedome from Turkiſh ſlavery, yet not ſo of his freedome from a farre worſe ſlavery under ſinne and Satan, whereunto he ſubjected himſelfe, when he renounced his Chriſtian faith. His three companions whom he left in Spaine, may yet ſtill, for ought we know, remaine loſt.
            
            He began to be found when he was touched in conſcience, and pricked in heart for his grievous Apoſtaſie. He went on in the right way to be found, when he made knowne his caſe to his Miniſter, and made confeſſion of his great offence to him: and yet further, when he willingly ſubjected himſelfe to the diſcipline of our Church, and manifeſted his willingneſſe to undergoe any pennance that ſhee ſhould enjoyne:

I feare there are ſome that have played Renegadoes, and as an evidence thereof, are circumciſed. Let ſuch know (whether they heare me themſelves, or ſhall heare of what I ſay by others) let them know, that by their ſecret thruſting themſelves into the Church, and concealing their ſinne from the Governours thereof, and that without juſt ſatisfaction which ought to be publikely given for an offence ſo ſcandalous as theirs is, they can never find ſuch peace in their conſcience as this Penitent may. Yea let them know that they have great cauſe to feare the deceitfullneſſe of their hearts, and to ſuſpect the truth of their repentance, if at leaſt they make any profeſſion of repentance. True Penitents, which by notorious ſinnes have diſhonoured their profeſſion, ſcandalized the Church, and given matter of inſultation to the enemies of true Religion, will not bee aſhamed to make open confeſſion of their ſinne, and be willing to undergoe any pennance that by the true Church ſhall be enjoyned to them.

The Biſhop riſen up, having prayed for them, and given them what counſell and charge he thought meet, bids them ſtand up: and diſmiſſeth them for that time: Being ſo diſmiſſed they gave themſelves to mourning, watching, faſting, praying, and other things meet for Repentance: and waited till the Biſhop ſhould call for them. Sometimes they were long put off before they were admitted into the Church, and participation of all Gods ordinances.
            But now the Church dealeth much more gently and gratiouſly with ſuch as ſhe conceiveth to be true Penitents. Yet ſo, as ſhe may ſearch, and

clenſe the wound, and worke the more perfect cure.
            Yee, yee, whoſoever you be that have renounced your Religion, and denied your Lord and Saviour, and yet without any publicke confeſſion or ſatisfaction intrude into the Church, and thruſt your ſelves in among the gueſts which are invited to the Lords Table, Ye draw a skin over a feſtring wound: Ye eat and drinke your owne damnation: Yee make the Lord to expoſtulate the caſe with you, and to ſay unto you, How came ye hither not having a wedding garment? This is the doome denounced againſt ſuch (Math. 22.13.) Binde them hand and foot, and take them away, and caſt them into outer darkneſſe, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth. Well note this and tremble. I wot well, that it were farre better for you to ſtand as humble Penitents in a Chriſtian Congregation on earth, humbly confeſſing your ſinnes and graciouſly receiving abſolution of them, then to be in the number of them, of whom the Sonne of man ſhall be aſhamed, when he commeth in the glory of his Father with his holy Angels (Mark 8.38.) And aſſuredly he will be aſhamed of ſuch, as having denied him are aſh
                  •
               med to make open confeſſion of that their deniall.
            But this Penitent here before us by his humble ſubmiſſion to the Churches order, and penitent confeſſion of his heighnous ſinne in the midſt of this great Congregation, apparently ſheweth, that as formerly he was not aſhamed

to deny Chriſt, ſo now he is not aſhamed to confeſſe Chriſt. He is indeed aſhamed. But of what? Even of his former ſhameleſneſſe. Of this ſhame he hath no cauſe to bee aſhamed: Unleſſe it be that he can be no more aſhamed, that he was before ſo graceleſly aſhamed of his Saviour.
            In this ground, he being, as yee heard before, received into the Church againe, I will againe apply my Text to him, and ſay of him,
He was loſt, and is found.
            
            
               Hetherto of the generall conſideration of my Text, by handling the two oppoſite termes joyntly in their diſtinct times. I proceed now to the particular points ſeverally: each by it ſelfe.
               The two branches which in ſpeciall ſprout out of the body of my Text, are theſe.
               1. The dammage of Apoſtacy, intimated in this word LOST, which giveth us to underſtand that
Apoſtacy implungeth into perdition.
               
               2. The advantage of Penitency intended under this word FOVND, which giveth us further to underſtand that
Penitency reſtoreth to ſalvation.
               
               Of these in order.
               It hath beene ſhewed before that the HEE here ment was an Apoſtate. Hee forſooke the Church, and in that reſpect hee is ſaid to

                   LOST: That is in the ſtate and caſe of him to whom eternall deſtruction and damnation belongeth. His Apoſtacy therefore implunged him into perdition: where into all Apoſtates are implunged. So much is intended under this phraſe 
                     Subſtractio ad perditionem

                  (Heb. 10.39.) a withdrawing or drawing backe unto perdition. The with-drawing whereof he ſpeaketh is from the profeſſion of the true Faith, an Apoſtaſy from it. This is evident by that which in way of oppoſition, hee addeth, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , but of Faith. We are not (ſaith he) of them that draw backe: but of them that cleave cloſe to the true Faith, and faſt hold it. Now by adding this inference (unto perdition) to that ſinne of drawing backe, he plainely ſheweth that Apoſtacy implungeth into perdition. In this reſpect that notorious Apoſtate Iudas is, by him that well knew what was his due, ſtiled, the ſonne of perdition, Iohn 17.12. Chriſt foreſeeing that he would fall away, and proove an Apoſtate, in relation thereunto termes him a ſonne of perdition, that is a man that would implunge him ſelfe into eternall deſtruction.
               S. Peter in ſetting downe this point, notes out the true ground and reaſon therof in theſe words, Denying the Lord that bought them, they bring upon themſ
                        •
                     lves ſwift deſtruction, 2 Pet. 2.1. By the Lord that bought them, hee meanes the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Now to deny him is an high pitch of Apoſtacy: And thereby 
                     •
                  hey bring upon themſelves deſtruction; in that there is no ſalvation

in any other. For there is no other name under heaven given among men whereby wee muſt be ſaved. Act. 4.12. They who deny him by whom alone ſalvation is to be had muſt needs bring deſtruction upon themſelves. This is the moſt principall reaſon of all.
               There is another like to this, noted by the Apoſtle (Hebr. 10.25.) they forſake and deſert the aſſembling of Saints together, that is, the Church of God, the Communion of Saints. Now as Chriſt is the onely Author and giver of ſalvation:

                   So he cauſeth the ſweet ſtreame of ſalvation to flow foorth upon his body onely: which is the true catholicke Church. Where the Apoſtle ſaith (Eph. 5.23.) He is the Saviour of the body, he meanes it excluſively, of none but of thoſe who appertaine to the body, and are members therof. In this reſpect the Church is fitly reſembled to Noahs Arke. For as none were ſaved from periſhing in the generall deluge, but they who abode in the Arke: So can none be ſaved from eternall perdition, but ſuch as remaine in the true Church. Apoſtates therefore, by deſerting the Church implunge themſelves into Perdition: and remaine as children of Perdition, even as perſons loſt, while they continue Apoſtates.

                  Hereby take notice of the wretched diſpoſition, and woefull condition of Renegadoes: who caſt themſelves out of the true Church, renounce their Chriſtian Faith, and denie the Lord who ſo dearely bought them. What,

what is then in this wide world that can countervaile ſuch a loſſe? Or what can ſtand him in any ſteed that is loſt? Can wealth? Can honour? Can liberty? Can life it ſelfe?
               
                  1. Wealth got by Apoſtacy is vaniſhing.
                  1. The wealth of this world, which is all the wealth that can be gotten by Apoſtacy, may prove like Ionahs gourd, and vaniſh away ere thou be aware: even while the thought of ſome ſeeming content is in thine head. But the wealth loſt by Apoſtacy, is, as the Apoſtle ſets it downe (Heb. 10.34.) 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   a ſolid ſubſtance: and that 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   much better then this world can affoord. For it is 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   
                  in Heaven: it is there treaſured up for us; and thereupon it is 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   
                  enduring, that never fades away. This better, enduring ſubstance, in Heaven, is loſt by ſuch as are themſelves LOST through Apoſtacy.
               
               
                  2. Honour of Apoſtates ends in ſhame.
                  2. The honour atchieved by denying the faith may prove like Hamans promotion, which lift him fifty cubits high above ground upon a gibbet: but the honour loſt by Apoſtacy, is 1 Pet. 2 9. a Royall Prieſthood, 
                  Rev. 3.11. a Crowne, 
                  Jam. 1.12. a Crowne of life,

                  h, may be ſome externall, temporary freedome from priſon, from chaines, from gallies, from bondage and ſlaverie under cruell men. But the liberty loſt thereby, is that

divine, and Rom. 8.21. 
                  glorious liberty of the Sonnes of God, 
                  Gal 5.1. 
                  wherewith Chriſt hath made them free: which is a freedome from the wrath of God, the curſe of Law, the dominion of ſinne, the tyranny of Satan, and eternall damnation. Is the rage of man more to be feared then the wrath of God? chaines of iron more then the bonds of the law? Bondage under Turkes more then ſlavery under Satan, whoſe worke which he enjoynes is villany; whoſe wages, which he gives is damnation? are blowes and ſtripes on the body,
                     Terrors of conſcience moſt terrible.
                   more then gawles and wounds of conſcience? The anguiſh of a tormenting conſcience is much more intolerable then of ſcourges, whips, baſtenadoes, ſtrapadoes, racks, or any torturing inſtruments on the body. There needs no other Accuſer of an Apoſtate then his owne conſcience: no other Witneſſe to convince him: no other Adverſary to aggravate his crime: no other Iewry to finde him guilty: no other Iudge to condemne him: no other hangman to execute his doome upon him. There needs no other to work his woe, then his owne conſcience. Inſtance all theſe in that great Apoſtate Iudas.

and enabled to endure all that they endured. For God uſeth to give ſuch inward comfort, courage, aſſiſtance and ſupportance to his Saints ſuffering for his names ſake, as is unutterable, unconceivable.

                  Beſides, the minde and meditation of Martyrs was ſo fixed on the recompence of reward, which with much confidence they expected, as the ſence of paine was ſwallowed up therewith. For they accounted all tortures that could be inflicted,Rom. 8.18. 
                  Not worthy to be compared with the glory to be revealed unto them. Moſt elegantly and emphatically hath the Apoſtle ſet out the wonderfull great diſproportion betwixt a Chriſtians ſuffering, and the recompence following thereon,2 Cor. 4.17. expounded. in theſe words, Our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a farre more exceeding and eternall weight of glory.
               
               1. All that can be by man inflicted on man is but

                  compreſsio, a preſſure, and that of the body onely. For man after hee hath killed the body, hath no more that he can do, Luke 12.5. Thus much is implied under this phraſe (Gen, 3.15.) Thou ſhalt bruiſe his heele. Satan by his inſtruments can reach no higher then the heele, that is the body, the inferiour part of man. For this preſſure of the body, by way of recompence, ſhall be conferred glory, that which of all is exceedingly deſired. The glory heere ment compriſeth under it whatſoever may make to the happineſſe of man, and that both in body and ſoule.
               
                  2. The kind of affliction is but 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   ſome light thing eaſie to be borne by him that is indued with the Divine Spirit. For afflictions for Chriſts ſake may be compriſed under that yoke and burden of Chriſt which is eaſie and light, Math. 11.30. But the recompence is 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   a weight, ſuch a weight as infinitly over-poiſeth all afflictions.
               3. The continuance of affliction is but 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   
                  for a while, even for a moment. At the uttermoſt they cannot extend beyond this preſent life, which is a ſhort life. But the weight of glory is 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   eternall, without date, without end.

               What Oratour or Rhetorician could have ſet out a difference or diſproportion more to the life and to the full, then the Apoſtle hath done in the fore-mentioned words?
               Who ſhould not, who would not bee mooved hereby to endure any thing that by man can bee inflicted for profeſſing Chriſt, rather then by denying him, looſe that exceedingly excelling weight

For they are eaſeleſſe and endleſſe, mercileſſe and remedileſſe. A fire kindled in mine anger (ſaith the Lord Deut. 32.22.) ſhall burn unto the loweſt Hell. Heare this, O Apoſtates, and tremble. Receive therefore the counſell which the Lord thus giveth (Luk. 12.4, 5.) I ſay unto you, my friends, Be not afraid of them who kill the body and after that have no more that they can do: But I will forewarne you whom you ſhall feare: Feare him who after he hath killed, hath power to caſt into Hell: yea, I ſay unto you, him feare.
               
               Becauſe hard and cruell uſage of Turks, and feare of worſe is the cauſe alleadged by this preſent

                  Penitent, whereby he was mooved to renounce his profeſſion of Chriſt, I have the longer inſiſted thereon, and indeavoured to make cleere theſe ſix diſtinct points.
               1. That Apoſtates may implunge themſelves into greater tortures then they can avoid.
               2. That all that by men can bee inflicted on conſtant profeſſours of the Chriſtian Faith, are no more then what God can and will inable them to beare.
               3. That greater tortures cannot be invented then have in former times beene inflicted on Chriſtians.
               4. That Martyrs in all ages have expreſſed much comfort &amp; joy in their greateſt ſufferings.
               5. That their recompence farre ſurpaſſeth their endurance.
               6. That by denying Chriſt that recompence is loſt and intolerable torments in Hell purchaſed.
               If theſe be not enough to embolden Chriſtians againſt all that man can do, I know not what can be enough.
               But yet there remaines one ſtumbling blocke to be remooved, and that is about life.
                     Faith of more worth then life.
                   For skin for skinne and all that a man hath will be give for his life.
               
               For ſatiſfaction hereunto let it be conſidered that
               1. This was the Divels allega
                     •
                  ion, Iob. 2.4. And ſhall a Chriſtian fight with the Divels weapons againſt Chriſt?

                     •
                   that high prize ſet upon life bee taken in a faire and right ſence, it muſt be applied ad idem, to matters of like kind. For a temporall life, all the temporall things that he hath, may be given: as (Mar. 5.26.) the woeman which had an iſſue of blood, ſpent all that ſhee had on Phyſitions, namely all her temporall eſtate. But the true faith is of another kinde: the good of our ſoules, the preſent conſolation, and future ſalvation of them, depends on a conſtant profeſſion of the true faith. It is not in our power to part with it.
               3. Life preſerved by Apoſtacy is but a temporary life, a ſhadow, a vapour, a bubble, a breath: Soone gone, even before a man can thinke of parting with it. How long did Iudas retaine his life after his Apoſtacy? The rich foole had his ſoule taken away long before his account. For while he dreamed of many yeares, he heard this ſummons, This night thy ſoule ſhall be required of thee (Luk. 12.20.)
               4. If life be preſerved ſome while, it may proove ſo troubleſome, ſo weariſome, ſo irkſome a life, ſo full of terrour and horrour as a man wiſh again and again that he had died before he denied Chriſt. Inſtance Iudas Iſcariot of old, and Francis Spira of late.
               5. Eternall life is forfeited by purchaſing temporall life after ſuch a manner. In this reſpect whoſoever will ſave his life ſhall looſe it, as Chriſt ſaith, Math. 16.25. Whoſoever denies Chriſt to ſave this temporall life is like to looſe eternall life.
               
                  6. Temporall life is not a valuable conſideration for the loſſe of the ſoule. For what ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoule? Math. 16.26.
               If it be ſaid that life being preſerved,
                     Pretence of future re

                           •
                        tance a vaine pretence for preſerving life.
                   an Apoſtate may finde opportunity of eſcaping out of perſecutors hands, and ſo repent, and returne unto the Church, and glorifie God: as a ſouldier by flying in time of danger, may againe returne into the field, and get the day: I anſwer that
               1. It is but a may be. Not one to a thouſand find ſuch an opportunity. This Penitent here before us found ſuch an opportunity. But many thouſands ſurprized by Turks as he was, ſpend all the remainder of their life in the ſtate of Apoſtaſie.
               2. If they finde an opportunity of eſcaping, it will not neceſſarily follow thereupon that they will or can repent having once denied their Saviour. As it fell out with the ten Lepers, ſo it falleth out too too uſually with Renegadoes: but one of the ten returned to give glory to God: which cauſed Chriſt to ſay, Where are the nine? Luke 17.17. Here is now one before us, that by a right courſe of penitency is admitted into the Church againe. About ten yeares now paſt there was another in like manner received at Minhead in Somerſet-ſhire. But are theſe two the tenth, or tenth of ten times ten of them that having played the Renegadoes are returned into their countrey, yet never gave any publike evidence of their true repentance?
               
                  
                  
                     Grace how abuſed.
                  3. It is a moſt undue and impious inference from Gods grace to ſinners, to take occaſion of ſinning: which the holy Apoſtle doth with much indignation deteſt. For where to the magnifying of the grace of God, and comfort of ſuch ſinners, as allmoſt to deſpaire felt the intolerable burden of ſinne preſſing upon their ſoules, he had ſaid, Where ſinne abounded, grace did much more abound,
                  Rom 5.20. ſome thence tooke occaſion of turning the grace of God into laſciviouſneſſe: with whom the Apoſtle thus expoſtulates the caſe, Shall wee continue in ſinne that grace may abound?
                  Rom. 6.1, 2. Having noted their impious inference, with a vehement deteſtation he thus rejects it, God forbid. Farre be any ſuch conceipt from a Chriſtians mind.
               That the non-conſequence of ſuch an inference may be the better diſcerned, the groffe miſtakings thereof are wiſely to be weighed. They are manifeſt in theſe three particulars.
               1. There is non cauſa pro cauſa: the cauſe is groſſely miſapplied. For they make Gods grace a cauſe of committing ſin, whereas the Apoſtle produceth it as the cauſe of remitting and removing ſinne.
               2. There is non ſubjectum pro ſubjecto: the ſubject matter, or thing whereupon Gods grace exerciſeth it ſelfe is miſchievouſly miſlaid. For they make ſinnes to come, or a reſolved purpoſe to con
                     •
                  inue in ſinne the ſubject of abundant grace, whereas the Apoſtle intendeth ſinnes paſt which can not be recalled: and thereupon

               3. There is non objectum pro objecto; the kinde of ſinner, who is made the object on whom abundant grace is conferred, is wretchedly miſtaken. For they take the Apoſtle to ſpeake of ſuch as delight in ſinne, and retaine a purpoſe of living and lying in ſinne: whereas he meaneth ſuch as finde and feele themſelves to be ſinners through ſence of the heavie loade of ſinne preſſing ſoare upon them: even ſuch sinners as Christ came to call to repentance, Mat. 9.13.
               Thus we ſee how pretence of returning to God afterwards is a moſt wicked pretence of denying God for the preſent.

threatned to be caſt into an hot fiery furnace, unleſſe they would worſhip Nebuchadnezars idoll, they make this reply (Dan. 3.16, 17.) O Nebuchadnezar wee are not carefull to anſwer thee in this matter. If it be ſo, our God, whom we ſerve, is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace: and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O King. But if not, be it knowne unto thee, O King, that we will not ſerve thy gods, nor worſhip thy golden image which thou haſt ſet up.

And though they were intreated by many of their kindred and friends otherwiſe, yea and by others in great place, and by the Iudge himſelfe, that they would take pitty on themſelves, their wives and children, yet would they not be induced by the entreatings of ſo many and great ones, ſo to be affected with the love of this life, as to forbeare the confeſsion of our Saviour, and to ſet light by the deniall of him.

For conſtancy of Martyrs unto death (of ſuch Martyrs as profeſſe the name of Chriſt and ſuffer for his Truth) is a great honour unto Chriſt. Is it not an high honour to a King to have ſuch Captaines and Champions as will not yeeld to their Soveraignes enemies, but ſtand it out to the uttermoſt till they get the victory, though it coſt them their life to get it? Yet no mortall King can (as Chriſt doth) put ſpirit, courage, or ſtrength into a ſubject: onely it is conceived that ſuch valourous ſouldiers as are ready to hazard their lives for their Soveraigne, ſerve a good Maſter. Thus doe Martyrs give perſecutors to underſtand that they ſerve a good Maſter:

                  the Church was wont to celebrat the memory of Martyrs: For which end they had ſet daies in the yeare, wheron Chriſtians in full aſſemblies met together, rehearſed catalogues of Martyrs, and gave ſolemne praiſe to God for the power of his Spirit, manifeſted in their admirable patience and perſeverance. And in Heaven they have the higheſt degree of glory. For though God doe not reward men ſimply for their workes, namely for the merit of them, yet he rewards according to

their works (Rom. 2.6.) and proportions the degree or meaſure therof, according to the kind of work which on earth is done, and according to the meaſure of grace wherby hee enables men to doe it.
               But Martyrdome is the moſt difficult, the moſt acceptable and honourable worke that on earth can be done: Vnto you it is given in the behalfe of Chriſt, (ſaith the Apoſtle Phil. 1.29.) not only to beleeve in him, BVT ALSO to ſuffer for his ſake. Martyrdome therefore is in Heaven crowned with the higheſt degree of Glory. GREAT is their reward in Heaven, Math. 5.12. On this ground they who ſet down the different degrees of celeſtiall glory by the different fruites which the good ground brought forth, Some thirty, ſome ſixty, ſome an hundred, apply the

                  the blood of the Martyrs is the ſeed of the Church. Wee reade (Reve. 13.3.) of a Beaſt whoſe head was wounded to death. Surely the Divell with his feends were wounded even unto death by Martyrs reſiſting unto blood. The time of the ten fierce perſecutions, and of the purity and power of Religion that followed thereupon containe thoſe thouſand yeares wherein Satan was bound. Rev. 20.2.
               
                  They who on the fore-mentioned grounds accounted not their life deare unto them, but prefer'd their Faith in the Lord Jeſus, and a ſtedfaſt profeſſion thereof before wealth, honour, liberty and life it ſelfe, and choſe rather to be faithfull Martyrs then deſperate Apoſtates, had good ground to be ſo minded.
               
                  Martyrs in mind.O that all who profeſſe the Faith of Chriſt were like minded! It well becomes us all to bee ſo minded. And if indeed wee be ſo minded, God who knowes the mind, heart, and ſpirit of a man will anſwerably account of him, and accept him, though he never bee brought to the fiery triall, as if he had beene brought to it, and indur'd it to the very uttermoſt:

Iam erat in Iob patientia, quam noverat Deus, &amp; cui teſtimonium perhibebat, ſed homnibus innotuit tentationis examine Aug. de bono cojug c. 21 The virtues and graces of the mind ſometimes are manifeſted in their deed or work: and ſometimes lie hid in their habit, as the virtue of Martyrdome. Many may have the ſame proweſſe that Martyrs have, who are not brought to the ſame proofe thereof. By trialls, that which is in a man before God is brought foorth before men: Not that it is then firſt begun, but that it is then firſt manifeſted. Before the Divell went about to ſift Iob, his ſoule was poſſeſſed with patience, which the Lord well knew, and whereunto he gave witneſſe: But to men it was made knowne by the tryall of tentation. Thus we ſee how we may bee Martyrs in the moſt halcyon times that can be, even ſuch as ours are: So as the ground and glory of Martyrdome is meet to be made knowne, and to

be meditated on in theſe our daies; and the rather, becauſe we cannot be ſure of an everlaſting continuance of our peace, or of the Goſpell of peace among us. As it is therefore needfull and uſefull in the prime and ſtrength of our age, when we have beſt health to meditate on the ſundry kinds of diſeaſes, and manifold caſualties whereunto we are ſubject, and on death, the end of all: so in the moſt flouriſhing times of the Church, meditation on the uttermoſt that may be endured even to the ſhedding of blood for faſt-holding our profeſſion of Chriſt, is a moſt meet meditation.
               Moſt eſpecially is this like to be uſefull for you Mariners, Merchants,Danger muſt make men be the better reſolved. Merchants-factors and others, whoſe calling it is to goe to ſea in ſhips, and to doe buſineſſe in the great waters, where yee are in danger to be ſurprized (as this Penitent was) by the mortall enemies of Chriſtians, or have occaſion to abide and trafique among them. You may be brought to triall, and to give proofe before men, whether the habit of Martyrdome be in you or no.
               
                  Be yee therefore ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Take unto you the whole armour of God, that yee may be able to ſtand in the evill day, and having done all, to ſtand.

There are trees whoſe rootes are as deepe, and ſpread as farre abroad in the earth, as their boughs aſcend, and ſpred themſelves in the aire. Our okes are ſuppoſed to be ſuch. No ſtormes, no tempeſts can overthrow them. The branches may ſooner be rent from the body, and the whole tree ſplit aſunder, then rooted up, and throwne downe. So a Chriſtian well rooted and grounded in the Articles of his faith, will ſooner have his limbes pull'd one from another, and his body and ſoule ſevered, then drawne from his faith, and renounce his profeſſion thereof.

great difficulty and perill. But they who goe to ſea for pleaſure, to be ſea-ſick, or to ſee ſtrange countries, if they ſee a black skie, and diſcerne ſtormes ariſing, they cry out, O back againe, back againe: Wee'l no furth

                   this caveat muſt be obſerved, that it be through faith in Gods promiſes, and confidence in the Spirits aſſiſtance: and not in conceit of his owne ſtrength. This is no better then preſumption. Peter failed herein, Mat. 26.33, &amp;c. This his reſolution and profeſſion (though all men ſhould be offended becauſe of thee, yet will I never be offended: and againe, though I ſhould die with thee, I will never denie thee) this profeſſion, and the reſolution of his mind anſwerable thereto, was good and commendable: all Chriſtians ought to be ſo minded, and to profeſſe as much: but not on ſuch a ground as he did. For he preſ
                     •
                  
                  med too much on his owne ſtrength. This Chriſt well diſcerned. Wherefore that he alſo might finde out, and diſcerne the deceitfullneſſe of his heart, and preſumption of his ſpirit, he was left to himſelfe: and ſo he fell from his profeſſion,

and denied his Lord. Selfe-conceit is a forerunner of Apoſtacy. Inſtance Pendleton in Queene Maries daies.
               By this caveat added to the direction it appeares how a Chriſtian jealouſie may ſtand with an undanted reſolution. Iealouſie, in regard of our owne weakneſſe: Reſolution, in regard of Gods aſſiſtance.
               
                  3. Set thy heart on the Faith.3. Set your heart on Chriſt and on his Goſpell. Be affected therewith as David was with God and his Law: which were his Love, his Ioy, his Delight; ſweeter to him then hony and the hony-combe. better then ſilver and gold. Love is of an uniting nature: it makes the ſoule of him that loveth to cleave cloſe to the object loved: as the ſoule of Jonathan was knit with the ſoule of David, (1 Sam. 18.1) ſo as he never renounced him, nor failed him in any ſtrait. But if, while men outwardly profeſſe the truth, they doe not inwardly and heartily love it, it may ſeeme juſt to the Lord, to ſend them ſtrong deluſions that they ſhould beleeve a lie (as is threatned, 2 Theſſ. 2.11.) and ſo renounce the true faith.
               
                  4. Walk worthy of the Goſpell.4. Walke worthy of the vocation wherewith yee are called. This direction is given by the Apoſtle (Epheſ. 4.1.) in theſe very words: and oft inculcated, under theſe and ſuch like phraſes, worthy of God who hath called you (1 Theſſ. 2.12.) worthy of the Lord, &amp;c. (Col. 1.10.) In theſe phraſes the Word importeth not any merit, or

                  condignity, but a meere meetneſſe and congruity, as is evident by this phraſe, fruits worthy of repentance (Luke 3.8.) that is (as the very ſame phraſe is tranſlated, Mat. 3.8.) meet for repentance. For if worthy ſhould there implie any matter of deſert, evill fruits would there be intended. For evill fruits they are which deſerve repentance. Fitly is this word thus tranſlated (Phil. 1.27.) as it becommeth. Let your converſation be 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  as it becommeth the Goſpell of Chriſt. This worthy walking imports a blameleſſe converſation. A man of a looſe life, whoſe conſcience checks him for living in ſinne, dares not venture his life, no not in Gods cauſe. He can have but ſmall hope of Gods accepting him. Vprightneſſe worketh boldneſſe. This made Saint Paul ſo bold and couragious in all his trialls, as he was, that he had lived in all good conſcience, Acts 23.1. He therefore exhorteth Timothy (1 Tim. 1.19.) to hold faith and a good conſcience. And to preſſe this point the further, he giveth inſtance of ſome that had put away a good conſcience, and concerning faith had made ſhipwracke. By this inference hee ſheweth that a good conſcience is as a ſhip: and faith as rich lading therein. If the ſhip be full of leakes, ſhip and lading are like to be loſt. A bad conſcience cannot hold faith in time of perſecution. Holy men have ever beene the ſtouteſt Martyrs.

                     nce.5. To all other meanes add faithfull, fervent, conſtant prayer. When the houre of

Chriſts ſuffering came he went into a garden to pray. There he praies not once, but againe, and againe: and being in an agony he prayed more earneſtly, Luke 22.44. To this the Apoſtle alludes (Heb. 5.7.) where he ſaith of Chriſt, that he offered up prayers and ſupplications with ſtrong crying and teares unto him that was able to ſave him from death and was heard. This meanes he alſo uſed for Peters ſtability, when Satan deſired to have him, that he might ſift him as wheat, I have prayed for thee (ſaith Chriſt, Luke 22.32.) that thy faith faile not. So as prayer is an eſpeciall meanes to keepe faith from failing. Theſe things are written for our learning, that wee might be incited to uſe the ſame helpe. Uſe it therefore before the triall, uſe it in the tryall. Call upon him that is able to eſtabliſh thee, and thou ſhalt aſſuredly be heard.
               
                  Redeeme Captives.To that which hath beene ſaid to ſuch as are in danger to be loſt, let mee add a word of exhortation to you that live at home ſafe and ſecure under the protection of the Defender of the true, ancient, Catholick, and Apostolick faith: have pittie, have pitty on thoſe that are in bondage under adverſaries, and perſecutors of the ſaid faith; on ſuch in particular as are, as this Penitent not long ſince was, taken captive by Turkes. Among other evidences of your pitty affoord ſome helpe to redeeme them. This is one of the ſeven capitall workes of charity and mercy. The ſeven are theſe.

               It were a worthy worke, well beſeeming the famous Citties of this Land, for every of them to have a ſacred treaſure for this end, to redeeme Captiues. But I feare leaſt ſuch a worke be more to be wiſhed then hoped for. Yet I conceive that it may well be wiſhed and hoped for too, that all who have good intelligence by certificate from the Trinity-houſe, or otherwiſe, would contribute ſomething towards the redeeming of every one, that time after time they ſhall heare to be held in captivity under the Turkes, or other like enemies of the Chriſtian faith. If every one of ability would make conſcience of this duty, though they gave but a little to one, and a little to another, many hundreds more might be releeved then now are.

But let the bowells of you which heare mee be mooved, and this my charitable motion will not be altogether in vaine.
               Hitherto of the firſt generall part of my Text: the danger of Apoſtacy, He was loſt.
               
               The ſecond followes, which ſheweth the Advantage and benefit of Penetency, He is found. Well note the grounds whereupon this word FOVND is uſed, and yee will clearely diſcerne that it importeth true Penitency, and a great benefit thence ariſing.
               The grounds are theſe.
               
                  Evidences of the Prodigalls repentance.1. The Prodigalls mind is renewed: for it is ſaid, verſe 17. that h
                        •
                      came to himſelfe. He was before witleſſe and ſenceleſſe: as a mad man, out of himſelfe.
               2. Hee diſcerneth the difference betwixt being in the Church and out of it: which difference he thus expreſſeth, How many hired ſervants of my Fathers houſe have bread enough, and to ſpare, and I periſh with hunger?
               
               3. His reſolution is altered. Before, the Church was a priſon to him: he muſt needs wander into a farre countrey, ver. 13. But now he thinkes of returning to the Church: I will ariſe (ſaith he, ver. 18.) and goe to my Father.
               
               
                  4. Hee meditates on a ſolemne confeſſion of his ſinne, thus, I will ſay unto him, Father, I have ſinned.
               
               5. Hee aggravateth his ſinne, in theſe words, Againſt heaven, and before thee, that is, openly in the ſight of Heaven: and ſecretly, before God.
               6. His heighnous ſinne more troubles him, then his heavie affliction, I have ſinned, ſaith hee.
               7. He acknowledgeth his unworthineſſe, I am no more worthy to bee called thy Sonne, ver. 19.
               8. He humbly contents himſelfe with the meaneſt place in Gods Church, Make mee as one of thy hired ſervants.
               
               9. He puts his purpoſe into practiſe, He aroſe and came to his Father.
               
               10. He leaves his former deſperate courſe (He aroſe) and entreth upon a new courſe, He came to his Father.
               
               Theſe were the evidences of his true penitency.
               The benefits thereof were theſe.
               1. His Father takes notice of his intention, when he was yet a great way off, his Father ſaw him,
                  Favours ſhewed to the penitent Prodigall. 
                  ver. 20.
               2. His Fathers bowells are mooved at ſight of him, He had compaſſion.
               
               3. His Father upon ſight of his true repentance made ſpeed to receive him, He ranne.
               
               4. His Father expreſſeth all, ſignes of a fatherly

affection, favour and love to him, He fell on his neck and kiſſed him.
               
               5. His Father ſo decks him, as he may appeare more amiable then before, He puts the beſt robe on him, ver. 22.
               6. His Father conferres on him things of dignity as well as of neceſſity, He put a ring on his hand, and ſhooes on his feet, Ibid.
               7. His Father gives evidences of the great joy he had at his ſonnes converſion, He kil'd the fatted calfe, and did eate and was merry, ver. 23.
               8. Others alſo rejoyced at this Apoſtates converſion. There was muſick and dancing, ver. 25.
               9. His Father teſt
                     •
                  fied better reſpect to him, then to the elder ſonne who never fell into ſuch exorbitant courſes. This is evident by the eldeſt ſonnes expoſtulation, ver. 29, 30.
               10. His Father accounts him as a new ſonne raiſed from the dead: and thereupon will not ſuffer his entire affection to be alienated from him by the brothers diſpleaſure againſt him, ver. 32.
               The fore-mentioned evidences doe clearely demonſtrate that the Apoſtate, of whom my Text ſpeaketh, was received into the ſtate of grace and ſalvation. Joyne therefore with the truth of the Prodigalls penitency, the favours that followed thereupon, all compriſed under this word FOVND, and it will appeare that
Penitency reſtores to ſalvation.
               
               Such as had implunged themſelves by Apoſtacy

into the ſtate of perdition, it brings into the ſtate of ſalvation.
               In this doctrine ye are diſtinctly to obſerve, firſt the ſure Ground-worke or Foundation, Penitency: and then the faire ſtructure of building reared thereupon, A reſtoring to Salvation.
               
               The former is taken pro conceſſo: as a point in no caſe to be queſtioned,The neceſſity of Repentance. but to be granted as an undeniable principle. For to proclaime pardon to an impenitent, or to put an Apoſtate into the ſtate of ſalvation without true, ſound, evident repentance, is to play the part of a fooliſh builder, that without a foundation builds an houſe on the earth: againſt which the ſtreame did beate vehemently and immediately it fell and the raine of that houſe was great, Luk. 6.49. If the ſtreame of temptation doe in any kind vehemently beate againſt the conſcience of ſuch a deceitfull convert, his vaine hope of ſalvation is like to turne into a certaine fearefull looking for of judgement. By experience we find that a deepe wound haſtely skinn'd over before it be throughly ſearched and clenſed, is like to feſter, and to proove incurable: So Apoſtacy or any other like ſcandalous and notorious ſinne, being ſoothed, and ſmoothed over with undue hope of mercy and pardon, before thorow humiliation of the ſoule, great contrition of the heart, free confeſſion of the mouth, and due ſatisfaction to the Church, which are all branches of true penitency, may proove unpardonable.
               
                  All the Prophets before Chriſt, his immediate Fore-runner, Chriſt himſelfe, his Apoſtles, and other faithfull Miniſters after them, have laid the Foundation of Repentance from dead works, to erect aſſurance of mercy thereupon. Whoſo confeſseth and forſaketh his ſinnes, ſhall have mercy. Pro. 28.13. Waſh you, make you cleane, put away the evill of your doings from before mine eyes, ceaſe to doe evill, learne to doe well, and come now and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord: Though your ſinnes be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be made white as ſnow, though they be made red like crimſon, they ſhall be as woole, Iſaiah 1.16, 17, 18. Returne ye Backſliding children, and I will heale your backſlidings, ſaith the Lord, Ier. 3.22. Turne yee, turne ye from your evill waies, for why will yee die. Ezek. 33.11. I will goe, and returne to my place, till they acknowledge their offence and ſeeke my face, ſaith the Lord. Hoſ. 5.15. By theſe particulars we are given to underſtand what was the conſtant doctrine of the Prophets. To like purpoſe Iohn the Baptiſt, Math. 3.2. Repent ye, for the Kingdome of Heaven is at hand. The very ſame did Chriſt preach, Math. 4.1
                     •
                  . and his Apoſtles, Mark. 6.12. To this queſtion, what ſhall we doe? St. Peter returnes this anſwer, Repent, and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Ieſus Chriſt for the remiſsion of ſins, Act. 2.37, 38. S. Paul expreſſely ſaith (Act. 26.20.) that he ſhewed that men ſhould repent and turne to God, and doe workes meet for repentance. It is an advice given to the back-ſliding Churches of

                  Aſia, to repent: as to Epheſus, to Pergamus, to Thyatira, to Sardis, and to Laodicea, Rev. 2.5, 16, 22, &amp; 3.3, 19. J might further fill volums with teſtimonies of Fathers, and later Divines tending to the ſame purpoſe. For other good and ſure foundation can no man lay.
               By this manner of raiſing, reſtoring, and receiving ſuch as are fallen,
               1. A concurrence of Mercy and Purity in God is manifeſted.Reaſons for the neceſſity of reſtoring penitents onely. Of Mercy in receiving ſuch as ran from him. Of Purity in receiving them upon their repentance.
               2. A mixture of Merit and Virtue in Chriſts Sacrifice is evidenced. Of Merit in procuring pardon for ſuch as denied him. Of Virtue, in altering their mind and diſpoſition.
               3. The extent of the operation of the Holy Ghoſt is made knowne: and that by healing the wounds of the ſoule by repentance, as well as by eaſing the anguiſh therof by aſſurance of pardon.
               4. The Goſpell, which publiſheth Gods free grace and rich mercy, is freed from the unjuſt imputation of a doctrine of looſeneſſe and licentiouſneſſe, in that it calleth ſuch ſinners to repentance, as it offereth grace unto.
               5. Faith which juſtifieth a ſinner without workes, is prooved to bee juſtified by workes, in that the ſinner who with the heart beleeveth unto righteouſneſſe, with the mouth maketh confeſsion unto ſalvation.
               
               6. The Church which admitteth none but penitents, is thereby declared to be an holy Church, and a communion of Saints.
               
                  Thus we ſee what good ground there is to lay downe this ground-worke of Penitency as a qualification for ſuch as are reſtored to the ſtate of ſalvation: ſo as all that ſhall be further ſpoken of reſtoring Apoſtates, muſt be underſtood to to be ſpoken of Penitents. For Chriſt hath once and againe as an irreverſible doome denounced, that except men repent they ſhall periſh, Luke 13.3, 5.
               Proceed we now to the ſtructure to be erected upon the afore-ſaid foundation. And that it be not raiſed higher then the foundation will well beare, we muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt the different kinds of Apoſtates.
               
               
                  Apoſtates who never returne.There are Apoſtates who having once turned their face from their Lord, never turne to him againe, as they of whom it is ſaid (Ioh. 6.66.) From that time many of Chriſts Diſciples went backe and walked no more with him. Of theſe, ſome are ſuch, as in regard of the event, never doe repent. Others are ſuch as in regard of the nature of their ſin, never can repent.
               
                  The Apoſtate uncapable of pardon.I find in Scripture one and that but one onely kinde of Apostates excluded from all hope of recovery. True it is that every Apoſtate implungeth himſelfe into the ſtate of perdition (as hath beene prooved before) inſo-much as if he live and die in that eſtate of Apoſtacy he cannot be ſaved. But there is a kinde of Apoſtacy which is ſtiled a ſinne unto death, for which no prayer is to be made (1 Iohn 5.16.) and for which there remaineth no more ſacrifice (Heb. 10.26.) and which

ſhall never be forgiven (Math. 12.32.) Such an Apoſtate is he who falls totus, a toto, in totum: wholy, from the whole, for ever.
               
                  Totus, wholy: that is in outward profeſſion and inward diſpoſition: in tongue and heart.
               
                  A toto, from the whole: that is from all the Articles of the Chriſtian religion.
               
                  In totum, for ever: or with a ſetled peremptory reſolution never to returne to the Religion againe.
               They who thus fall, uſe to hate, blaſpheme, and perſecute the faith from whence they are fallen, and the preachers and profeſſours thereof: which they doe notwithſtanding they have knowledge and be in their ſoule perſwaded of the truth of that Faith from which they ſo fall.
               Such were the Phariſies, whom Chriſt chargeth with blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, Mar. 3.29, 30. Such were Hymeneus and Alexander (1 Tim. 1.20.) whom Paul delivere
                        •
                      unto Satan, that they might learne not to blaſpheme: and againſt whom hee maketh a juſt imprecation. 2 Tim. 4.14.

Hiſt. l. 5. c. 2.Such an one allſo was Iulian ſtiled the Apoſtate: of whom it is reported that ſuddenly he did ſo openly and impudently renounce his faith in Chriſt, as with certaine Sacrifices

and inchantments, and a bloody offering he waſhed away the Baptiſme received of Chriſtians: and renoūced his admittance into the Church: and from that time uſed privately and publickly killings and quarterings of beasts and other ſuperſtitious rites of the Gentiles. This mind of Julian, then Emperour, about the ſolenmities of the Gentiles, did not a little trouble and aſtoniſh Chriſtians, eſpecially becauſe he had beene a Chriſtian before. For, as one addicted to his fathers
                  ▪ (which was the Chriſtian) religion, he was of a child trained up according to the cuſtom of the Church, and inſtructed in the ſacred Scriptures and brought up under Biſhops and eccleſiaſticall perſons.

was the moſt ſpightfull, mortall, malicious and miſchievous enemy that Chriſtians ever had: and ſo continued to his death: wherein though hee were forced to acknowledge the powerfull revenging hand of Chriſt upon him,

               It is impoſſible to renew ſuch Apoſtates againe unto repentance. But all others may be renewed, and reſtored to ſalvation: as

               2. Such as have renounced, not all the Articles

of the Chriſtian Religion, but thoſe onely for which they were called in queſtion. Theſe fall not a toto, from the whole faith.
               3. Such as fall animo reſurgendi, with a minde and purpoſe to riſe againe, and to returne to the Church againe: and that upon the firſt opportunity of eſcape that they can get. Theſe fall not in totum, with an utter, finall deſertion of the Church, at leaſt in their intention.
               Every of theſe kindes of Apoſtacy, is indeed moſt heighnous in the kinde thereof: from yeelding whereunto every Chriſtian ought to be farre: and more ready to endure the moſt bitter Martyrdome that ever any Chriſtian did, then either in profeſſion alone, or from any one fundamentall Article of the true faith, or for any intended time to fall. For in every of theſe waies is God highly diſhonoured, his Sonne our Saviour extremely under-valued, the glorious Goſpell vilified, the profeſſion thereof diſgraced, weake brethren offended, and adverſaries occaſioned to triumph and inſult.
               Yet are not the fore-mentioned Apoſtates, no nor others, though worſe then they (except onely before excepted, ſuch as ſinne unto death) to be excluded from all hope of recovery, mercy, and pardon. And that for theſe reaſons,
               1. The freeneſſe of Gods grace. For God juſtifieth freely by his grace, Rom. 3.24. and his free gift is of many offences, Rom. 5.16. Wherefore that the freeneſſe of Gods grace may more clearely be manifeſted, it pleaſeth him to extend

it to ſuch, as of all others are moſt unworthy (as Apoſtates who denie him, are.

                  ) Mans unworthineſſe gives evident proofe of the freeneſſe of Gods grace. And the more unworthy any may be thought to be, the more free will that grace which is extended to him, be knowne to be. So as pardon of ſin may in faith be expected from him who wil not the death of a ſinner, but that repenting he may be freed from deſtruction, and ſaved by the mercy of God. If any thinke otherwiſe, he is not a Chriſtian, but a Novatian.
               
               2. The riches of Gods grace. God is ſaid to be rich in mercy, Epheſ. 2.4. Now the greatneſſe and heighnouſneſſe of ſinne commends the riches of mercy, and ſhewes that to be true, which is ſaid, Rom. 5.20. Where ſinne abounded grace did abound much more. But by Apoſtacy ſin aboundeth, and may be reckoned in the number of great crimes: yet in the Church, ſuch as repent ought not to deſpaire of Gods mercy.
               3. The infinite value and worth of Chriſts ſacrifice. It is a ſufficient price for any ſinne, yea and for all ſins: in which reſpect it is ſaid, that the blood of Ieſus Chriſt clea

               1. They wilfully and utterly reject the onely meanes of pardon, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. In this reſpect they are ſaid to tread under foot the Sonne of God, Heb. 10.29.
               
                  2. They neither will, nor can repent. It is impoſsible to renue them againe unto repentance.

                        •
                     , 6. As other ſinners who doe not repent are not pardoned, ſo theſe Apoſtates, becauſe they cannot repent cannot be recovered.
               3. An irreverſible doome of the Judge is abſolutely without any limitation gone out againſt theſe: but it is not ſo againſt any other ſinners. The doome is this, Whoſoever ſpeaketh againſt the Holy Ghoſt it ſhall not be forgiven him, Mat. 12.32.
               4. The meanes to be uſed by others for recovering ſinners is abſolutely forbidden in theſe mens caſe. The meanes is prayer. The prayer of faith ſhall ſave the ſick: and if hee have committed ſinnes they ſhall be forgiven him, Iames 5.15. But the Apoſtle, even where he preſcribeth this meanes for obtaining pardon, excepteth the ſin unto death, thus, If any man ſee his brother ſin a ſin, which is not unto death, he ſhall aske, and he ſhall give him life, for them that ſin not unto death. There is a ſin unto death, I doe not ſay that he ſhall pray for it, 1 Ioh. 5.16.
               4. A fourth ground of an Apoſtates recovery is the extent of Gods promiſes, which extent is ſo large, as (except before excepted) it excludeth none. All manner of ſin ſhall be forgiven unto men,

               5. A fift is Gods faithfullneſſe in ratifying the juſt cenſure of his Church. For Chriſt gave to his Church in the perſon of Saint Peter power of binding and looſing, when he ſaid (Mat. 16.19.)

                  I will give unto thee the keyes of the kingdome of heaven: and whatſoever thou ſhalt binde on earth ſhall be bound in heaven: whatſoever thou ſhalt looſ
                        •
                      on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven. When therfore the Church upon due obſervation of an Apoſtates true repentance abſolves him, and receives him into her communion, that Apoſtate may juſtly be accounted to be recovered, and to be brought into the ſtate of ſalvation.
               6. The laſt ground,Examples of Apoſtates pardoned. which now I intend to note, is example. For we reade that in all ages Apoſtates, and that of all ſorts and kindes (except before excepted) have beene recovered, and received into the favour of God and his Church.

                   the firſt man was a moſt notorious Apoſtate. Yet the Church in all ages hath taken it for grant, that he repented and was ſaved. It is therefore reckoned among the hereſies of the Tacians, that they oppoſed the ſalvation of the firſt man. The promiſe of redemption was firſt made to our firſt Parents, Gen. 3.15. and that they beleeved it, may be inferred from their teaching their children to offer ſacrifice, Gen. 4.3, 4.
               The children of Iſrael in Egypt played the parts of Apoſtates, by the Idolatry which they committed (Ezek. 
                  
                     •
                  0.7, 8.) ſo in the Wilderneſſe (Exod. 32.1, 2, &amp;c.) and in the land of Canaan, under their Judges (Iudges 2.17:) and under their Kings (2 King. 29.6.) Yet upon their humiliation and repentance, God received them to grace and favour.
               But to give inſtance of particulars, Salomon in

his old age proved an Apoſtate (1 King. 11.4.) yet he repented as is evident by his booke ſtiled Eccleſiaſtes, which the Hebrews ſay (as we heard before) is the book of Salomons repentance. That God was mercifull in pardoning his Apoſtacy, appeares by this promiſe which God made to David concerning him (2 Sam. 7.14, 15.) If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the ſtrip

               Many forſooke Paul, which was a kinde of Apoſtacy: but Pauls prayer for mercy to be ſhewed to them (2 Tim. 4.16.) gives evidence of a poſſibility, yea and a probability too of their finding mercy.
               In the ten fierce and fiery perſecutions of Chriſtians

under the Romane Emperours, many renounced the Chriſtian faith:

                   manifeſted in his Word by his owne free and rich grace offered to penitents, by the directions given to his people to receive ſuch, and by their conſtant courſe in entertaining ſuch, the Catholike Church adjudged Novatus to be accounted an Heretique, and put Novatians into the Catalogue of Heretiques.

Upbraide not his circumciſion; upbraide not his ſubjecting himſelfe to Mahometiſme: ſhunne not his ſociety; avoid not communion with him, no not in the moſt ſacred and divine ordinances: trafique with him: eate and drinke with him, pray with him and pray for him: Receive him as a brother beloved: Forgive him, comfort him: I beſeech you that you would confirme your love toward him.

               5. Let me in the laſt place leave a few directions with thee, O Penitent, upon whoſe occaſion we are here met.
               
                  
                     1. Repentance muſt be from the heart.
                     
                        Oportet paenitentiam agentes flere a marè, &amp; reliqu

                            quae paenitentiae propria ſunt ex corde demōſtrare Baſil. Moral. Sum. 1. c. 3.
                  1. That which now thou doſt openly with thy tongue and body before us children of men, doe it ex animo, do it heartily as to the Lord the Searcher of hearts. Thus will thy repentance be ſound indeed. Thus will much inward peace be brought to thy conſcience. Thus wilt thou be looſed in Heaven as well as on earth. All the grace and favour which now the Church ſheweth is upon this pious and charitable preſumption, that in proſtrating thy body thy ſoule is humbled, and that the confeſſion of thy mouth proceedeth from the contrition of thy heart. If it bee otherwiſe, thou diſſembleſt with the Church, thou deceiveſt thine owne ſoule, and mockeſt God who will in no wiſe br
                     •
                  oke ſuch mockings. Unleſſe thou do, what t
                     •
                  ou doſt, ſincerely and heartily, thou art in no better caſe (if not in a worſe) then they who have ſuffered themſelves to be circumciſed by profeſt enemies of Chriſt, and therewithall

renounced the faith of Chriſt, and yet ſeek not to bee looſed by the Church of Chriſt. They cannot in Faith expect to be looſed in Heaven, becauſe they are not firſt looſed on earth. Nor canſt thou expect to partake in Heaven of the benefit of the Churches looſing thee on earth, becauſe it is utterly made void by the deceitfullneſſe of thy heart. But we are perſwaded better things of thee, and things that accompany Salvation though I thus ſpeake.
               
               
                  2. Apoſtacy requires more then ordinaty repentance.2. Be inwardly more dejected in ſoule, more pierced in ſpirit, and broaken in heart, then with the teares of thine eyes, beatings of thy breſt, caſting downe of thy body, and confeſſion of thy mouth thou canſt expreſſe. For thy ſinne for which this penance is enjoyned is an heinous ſinne,Aggravation of Apoſtacy. a crying ſinne, a ſinne that comes neare to the unpardonable ſinne, that ſinne unto death. Thereby thou deniedſt the Lord that bought thee: thereby thou renouncedſt the onely meanes of thy ſalvation: thereby thou ranneſt out of thy Lords campe into the army of his enemies, and ſo becammeſt an enemy to thy Lord.

                   How diſhonourable was this to thy Lord? How diſgracefull to his Church? O how did thoſe curſed enemies inſult thereat? What cauſe haſt thou to cry our (as Ier. 9.1.) Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountaine of teares, that I might weepe day and night for my ſinne? Thou haſt cauſe ynough to draw water (as the Iſraelites did, 1 Sam. 7.6.) from the

bottome of a broaken heart, and to powre it out before the Lord, as he who ſaid (Pſal. 119.136) Rivers of water runne downe mine eyes. Remember what Peter did, when he was put in mind of ſuch a ſinne as thou haſt committed, He went out and wept bitterly, Math. 26.75. Thoſe bitter teares muſt needs flow out of the bottome of an heart throwly broken.
               Mee thinkes I now behold many weeping eyes in this aſſembly, bewailing thy woefull fall; and I muſt confeſſe that I also find mine owne bowels troubled within me. All this is in compaſſion of thy caſe. Oughteſt not thou to be much mooved thereat? Howſoever the Church be pleaſed in much-tender-compaſſion to enjoyne this eaſie, milde penance unto thee, doe thou betwixt God and thine owne ſoule yet further loade thy ſelfe through a ſerious and d

Repentance is to be ordered according to the kind and meaſure of ſin.
               
                  3 Repentance daily to be renewed.3. Let not thy penitency end with the penance of this day. Well note the Lords exprobration to Iſrael (Iſa. 58.5.) Is it ſuch a faſt that I have choſen? A day for a man to afflict his ſoule? Nor is one daies penance ſufficient repentance for ſuch a ſinne as thou haſt committed, I have heard a tradition concerning

                  Peter that he wept whenſoever he heard a Cock crow. It becommeth a penitent Apoſtate, whensoever by any occaſion he is put in mind of his ſinne, to be ſtruck at his heart with godly remorſe. Thou didſt long lie in thy ſinne: even ſo long as thou livedſt among the Turkes. All that while thou didſt conforme thy ſelfe to Mahometiſme. And thinkeſt thou one day of penance to be ſufficient? Continue to renew thy repentance every day: though thy life be prolonged in the Chriſtian Church many more yeares, then thou wert among the Turkes.

                  4. Bee very circumſpect over thy ſelfe for the remainder of thy life, that thou bring foorth fruite meete for repentance. This is that worthy walking, whereof wee ſpake before. As a wife that hath formerly lived looſely, and defiled the marriage bed, beeing received into the favour of her husband againe, muſt carry her ſelfe more ſoberly, more modeſtly, more inoffenſively, and muſt bee more watchfull in avoiding all temptations that might allure to that ſinne againe, ye and all ſuſpicions thereof: So an Apoſtate received by the Church into grace and favour, muſt walke more circumſpectly then if he had not fallen. For it much lieth on him to repaire his Chriſtian credit: or rather to be the more zealous in honouring God, and bringing glory to the Goſpell of Chriſt &amp; to his Church, yea and in giving matter of rejoycing to profeſſors

of the true religion. This is a point that meerely concernes thee, O Penitent.

                  5. Take heed of relapſe. Chriſt himſelfe ſaw this to be a needfull caveat: and thereupon preſt it once and againe on ſuch as he had recovered from ſin: as on the woman taken in the act of adultery (Ioh. 8.11) thus, Goe and ſinne no more: and on him that had beene deſeaſed 38. yeares he enforceth it with a commination (Ioh. 5.14.) thus, Sin no more, leſt a worſe thing come to thee. For if, after we are freed from the miſery of ſin, we returne to it againe, ſoarer vengeance is like to befall us. Experience ſhewes how dangerous a relapſe is after a recovery from a bodily ſickneſſe. Much more dangerous is a ſpirituall relapſe after repentance from an heighnous ſin. The heart of man by ſuch a relapſe will be much more hardned in ſin; and the Divell in ſuch a caſe will take with himſelfe ſeven other ſpirits more wicked then himſelfe, and they will enter in, and dwell there (Mat. 12.45.) Yea and God himſelfe may be ſo incenſed thereby,

as to affoord no more grace to him that hath ſo ill imployed his former grace, as to depart cleane away from it. Thus the laſt ſtate of that man is worſe then the firſt. Looke therefore narrowly to thy ſelfe, thou who art now reſtored: and make uſe of thoſe directions which were before given to ſuch as goe downe to the Sea, to make them conſtant in holding the faith.
               
                  6. True penitents may and muſt beleeve that they are fully diſcharged.6. Beleeve that thou art now acquitted of that heighnous ſin of renouncing the Chriſtian faith. If thine heart bee upright thou haſt good cauſe to beleeve it, in that thou haſt taken that courſe which in Gods Word is preſcribed for obtaining a diſcharge. Thou haſt beene pricked in thine heart for thy ſin (as the Jewes, Acts 2.37.) Thou didſt goe to thy Paſtor, and enquire what in thy caſe thou ſhouldſt doe (as they who being defiled came to Moſes, Numb. 9.7.) Thou haſt ſubjected thy ſelfe to the order which the Church preſcribed (as David did to Gods advice, 2 Sam. 24.19.) Thou haſt made penitent confeſſion of thy ſin (as they did who came to be baptized of Iohn, Mat. 3.6.) Thou haſt deſired this Congregation to pray for thee (as the Iſraelites deſired Samuel to pray for them, 1 Sam. 12.19.) The Church looſeth and abſolveth thee (as the Church of Corinth abſolved the inceſtuous perſon, 2 Cor. 2.10.) On theſe grounds thou maiſt ſafely, thou oughteſt faithfully to beleeve that thy deepe-died ſcarlet ſinne is waſhed away by the blood of thy Saviour to whom thou art now returned: and that thou art fully

For Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity: and in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile, Pſal. 32.2. If therefore thy conſcience ſhall hereafter be overmuch troubled with doubtings, and feares, and deſpaire of pardon of thine Apoſtacy, account it a temptation of Satan, and yeald not unto it, but reſiſt it; and ſay to thy ſoule, Why art thou caſt do

By exerciſing thy faith after this manner thou wilt bring much peace to thy conſcience, and make the remainder of thy life more comfortable to thee: and with much cheerefullneſſe carry thy ſelfe as a child of the Church in the works of thy calling: and in all duties of piety, juſtice, and charity. Only be carefull to obſerve the former directions with this conſolation.

                   lieth in thee to bring other Renegadoes to returne to the Church, to ſubmit themſelves to the diſcipline thereof, to be willing to give ſatisfaction by publick penance. And the rather to encourage them thereunto, make knowne unto them the inward peace and comfort which thou haſt received hereby. This is a duty which on a like ground Chriſt enjoyned

to Peter (Luke 22.32,) in theſe words, When thou art converted ſtrengthen thy brethren: and David undertaketh to do as much, Psal. 51.12, 13. where he maketh this prayer and promiſe, Restore unto mee the joy of thy ſalvation, and uphold mee with thy free Spirit: Then will I teach tranſgreſſours thy waies, and ſinners ſhall be converted unto thee. This is a good kinde of recompence which ſuch as fall, make to the Church. As by their fall many are offended, ſo by their riſing many may be eſtabliſhed. If by private meanes thou canſt not ſo farre prevaile with ſuch as thou knoweſt to be Renegadoes, as to bring them voluntarily to make ſatisfaction to the Chruch, then follow Chriſts advice, Mat. 18.17. Tell it unto the Church. As for thy ſelfe, that thou maiſt remaine henceforth ſtedfaſt and unmoveable in the faith, thou ſhalt not want the prayers of them, who now with much rejoycing praiſe God that the Text is accompliſhed in thee: in which reſpect we may conclude as we began, and ſay,
HE WAS LOST, AND IS FOVND.
