            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

                     ❧ To the right honorable
Sir Francis Walſingham, Knight,
principal Secretarie to her Maieſtie, and
one of her Highneſſe moſt honorable priuie
Counſell, Io. Ba. wiſheth in this life the feare
of God, and in the life to come,
euerlaſting rest with
Ieſus Christ.
                  
                     COnſidering (right honorable)
that diuers both of our countrymen,
and others, haue very
paynefully and fruitefully laboured,
to ſet forth the expoſition
and meaning, both of
the ten Commandements, &amp;
alſo of the Lordes prayer, and that in the Engliſh
tongue: I thought good, not to meddle any further
that waye, ſeeing ſo good an entrance was
made vnto it: But neither ſeeing nor hearing of
any that had giuen forth any ſermons or lectures,
vpon the articles of our Chriſtian faith, a thing as
neceſſarie as the other, I was the more emboldened
to ſet this treatiſe forth, that the ſimple and
ignorant, which can but only reade, and haue this
benefite to profite themſelues withall, might haue
the true and playne meaning of euery article of
their faith, as they haue the expoſition of the
Lordes prayer, and ten Commandements. For if
this Creede, commonly called the Creede of the
Apoſtles, ſhall onely be ſayde without booke, and
rehearſed of the people, without the meaning of
it in more words: then they can not take ſuch cō
                     fort

out of theſe articles as were requiſite, becauſe
they do not vnderſtande them. And ſo great and
excellent myſteries lying hid, ſhal do no good, becauſe
they are not opened and reuealed to the
ſimpler ſort. The cauſe that moued me to preſent
theſe my firſt fruits vnto your Honour, was, That
partly you had heard them read vnto you, &amp; your
Honors accepting of them as fauoring the trueth
ſhall incourage others to doe the like, and reade
them more diligently. I haue not laboured to be
curious in this matter, but ſo plaine as the weakeſt
of capacitie might eaſely vnderſtande: for whoſe
ſake, and not for the learned I was willing to publiſh
this worke, according to that talent that the
Lorde in mercy hath committed vnto me his ſeruant,
for the building vp of his ſpirituall temple. I
doubt not, but by the working of Gods holy ſpirit
in you in reading of theſe articles nowe and then,
your Honour, (being voyde of waightier matters
and affayres, when leaſure ſhall ſerue,) you ſhall
finde ſome comfort and conſolation in them. Although
they be playne, yet are they true, &amp; neede
no eloquence to ſet them forth: for trueth ſeeketh
no corners to hide her ſelfe in: Onely her feare is
leaſt ſhe ſhould be hid. I graunt, it might ſeeme a
needleſſe and fruitleſſe thing to write bookes and
publiſhe them in theſe dayes, wherein are ſuch
ſtore that nowe bookes lacke readers, rather then
readers want bookes: but if a man conſider well
with him ſelfe, he ſhall finde that a great many of
them tende not ſo much to ſet forth godlines, as
wantonnes: neither do they profit the Church and
common wealth, but rather hurt and hinder it as
much as in them lyeth, ſo that it had bene better

that a great many of them had bene ſuppreſſed
and neuer bene written. They hurt many, for they
leade yong men, (vnleſſe Gods ſpirit guide them
the better) to vtter deſtruction. Theſe are not the
bookes that teach young men, which are by nature
wanton and wilde, and giuen to luſtes, to refraine
from libertie of the fleſh: but rather giue
them the bridle to theſe wanton luſtes and appetites:
and pitie it is they ſhould bee ſuffered in a
Chriſtian cōmon wealth. Theſe idle bookes teach
not a man to amende and correct his wayes, but
vtterly to peruert them. A young man therefore
ſhall clenſe his wayes, not by theſe meanes, but by
ruling himſelf according to the word of the Lord,
as the Prophet Dauid hath forewarned, Pſal. 119.
ſo then although the ſtore of bookes in our dayes
is great, yet the number of them that encreaſe
true godlineſſe, is not ſo great, but that it may be
augmēted. And albeit ſome one booke pleaſe not
euery man, yet another may, ſeeing there are diuers
and diuers giftes giuen to edifie, that all men
may be without excuſe before the Lorde. If any
find fault and ſay, This writer is too hard and hye
for my capacity, he may haue an eaſier: if this
man bee too eloquent and fine, he may haue another
that is more ſimple and playne: for God be
thanked, there is great varietye of giftes in the
Church of Chriſt: and as it is in the body naturall
of men that al members are not alike, nor haue
the ſame function, yet all are neceſſary: and although
the foote be not ſo excellent a member as
the hand or the eye, yet for the vſe of the body, it
is as neceſſary &amp; profitable: neither can the head
ſay to the foote, I haue no neede of thee, but one

hath neede of the helpe of another for the maintenance
of ye whole: So it is in ye myſtical body of ye
Church, ſome haue more excellent giftes then
others, and ſome may be likened to the head, ſome
to the eye, and ſome to the hand: other of inferiour
giftes to the foote and to the legge which yet
ſurely can not be deſpiſed or lightly ſet by, conſidering
the body can not want them: neither is
this onely to be ſeene in the myſticall body of
the Church, wherein ſome are paſtors, ſome doctors,
ſome Deacons, and ſome haue the gift of eloquence,
ſome of knowledge, ſome of vtterance,
&amp; ſome of tongues: But this may be perceiued in
the body of the common wealth, wherein ſome
are kinges and rulers, appoynted of God to bee
heades ouer others, and ſome are crafteſmen, and
artificers, ſome huſbandmen and plowmen farre
inferiour to the other, and yet notwithſtanding, as
neceſſary is the poore labouring man for the ciuil
body, as is the magiſtrate and ſuperiour: for if
all ſhould rule, who ſhoulde obey: if all againe
ſhould obey, who ſhould rule or gouerne? but nowe
the Lorde hath ſo tempered and diſpoſed theſe
thinges in his infinite wiſedome, that there ſhould
be no diſorder, and that euery one ſhould be indetted
and bounde to another: that ſo, loue and
vnity might be kept and maynteyned in al. For no
one man hath all giftes giuen vnto him, that hee
might ſtande in neede of his neighbour, and loue
him the better, hauing that gift which hee ſeeth
him ſelfe to be deſtitute of. Thus, being willing
to performe all the duties of a faithfull miniſter
of Ieſus Chriſt vnto your honour, I leaue to trouble
you any furthet from other affayres of your

Prince and countrey, beſeeching the Almightie
to increaſe his gratious giftes in you, to the honour
of his holy name, the profit of his Church,
and the conſolation of your owne ſoule
in the ende. Which he graunt vnto
your honour for his Chriſtes
ſake. Amen. 1579.
                  
                     Your honours in the Lorde Ieſus▪
moſt humble to commande.

reader, grace and peace from

Ieſus Chriſt. Amen.
                  
                     I Haue for thy ſake (gentle
reader) ſet forth vnto thee
briefly the meaning of al the
articles of our Chriſtian
fayth, which are neceſſary
to ſaluation: to this ende and
purpoſe, that as thou haſt in Engliſh an expoſition
vpon the ten commaundements of almighty
God and the Lordes prayer, to knowe
the better what they meane: ſo thou mighteſt
haue likewiſe in thy mother tongue, ſome
opening of theſe Chriſtian articles, which being
well applyed to thy owne conſcience by a
liuely fayth, thou ſhalt finde ſweeter vnto thee
then either hony, or the hony combe, &amp; a treaſure
to bee preferred before much gold, yea
the fineſt that may be. And becauſe ſermons
are not ſo common in euery pariſh Church, as
by the lawe of God, and the prince they ſhould
be: thou mayeſt therefore vſe this booke priuately
in thy houſe when thou ſhalt haue leaſure,
as vpon the Sundayes and holy dayes at

after noone. The whole ſumme of thy faith is
here ſet forth ſo plainely, that thou mayeſt eaſily
vnderſtande it, if the Lorde ſhall giue his
grace to thee, &amp; open thine eyes to ſee: otherwiſe
nothing can be eaſie to any man, but an
open booke ſhalbe as ſealed vnto men, except
the ſpirit reueale it vnto them, which he will
doe, no doubt, if thou ſeeke it by humble and
earneſt prayer to God, in his ſonnes name. For
ſurely this is the cauſe, why many reading the
Scriptures vnderſtand them not, becauſe they
come to them with vnprepared heartes, not
ſubdued with humilitie, but preſuming with
their naturall witte, to vnderſtand the myſteries
in them conteined. But fleſh &amp; blood doth
not reueale theſe ſecret and hid thinges vnto
vs. Other reade them without prayer, to vnderſtand
them, other ſome reade them but to
diſpute, and talke of them with the learned,
and not to amende their liues, being detected
by them, but onely to knowe them, and let the
practiſe goe. But theſe men ſo doing, can not
be bleſſed Luke 11. cap. Wherfore dearely beloued
Chriſtian, I exhort thee to reade the
ſcriptures, and all other bookes, that tende to
the declaration of the ſcriptures, with a ſingle
eye, and penitent heart, not thinking or
preſuming any thing of thy ſelfe, for the wind

bloweth where it listeth, as our ſauiour ſayth,
Iohn 3. And theſe diuine thinges are moſt
commonly had from the wiſe and men of vnderſtanding,
and opened by the ſpirit vnto litle
babes. Matth. 11. that is to ſuch as are
humble in their owne conceyte, and in their
owne eyes. For the holy Ghoſt ſayth: Them
that be meeke will hee guide in iudgement,
and teach the humble his waye. Pſal. 26. So
then the humble ſhalbe exalted, and they all
that exalt them ſelues ſhalbe brought lowe.
Luk. 14. fare well (deare brother) and vſe
this booke, as it was meant, to thy good and
comfort, which Ieſus Chriſt graunt vnto
thee. Amen.

alwayes to pray for thee. I. B.

                  The firſt Sermon vpon
the firſt article, I beleue in God
the father almightie, maker of
heauen and earth.
                  
                     BEfore we come to ſpeake
of the meaning of theſe
wordes, it ſhall not be amiſſe
to cōſider in a word
or two, who made this
Chriſtian order and forme
of our beliefe. The generall and common
opinion receaued with the whole conſent of
the Church, is, that the xii. Apoſtles of our
ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt, made this Creede, euery
one an article, as a godly writer of our
time, one Aretius in his booke of queſtions
doeth ſhew. Therefore it is called the Apoſtles
Creede. But whether it were they or
no that made it, or any other, it is no great
matter, ſeeing it is all the vndoubted trueth
of Gods worde, &amp; euery poynt of it agreeth
with the reſt of the holy ſcriptures written
with the Spirit of Chriſt. We haue many
bookes in the olde &amp; new Teſtament, which
are written for our conſolation &amp; comfort,
and that by the finger of God, but yet we
knowe not the names of thoſe men that

wrote them, as the booke of the Iudges, the
booke of Kinges, and the Chronicles, and
ſuch like: and in the newe Teſtament the
Epiſtle to the Ebrewes. Theſe all are the
holy worde of God, but yet we knowe not
the authors of them. And it ſeemeth that the
holy Ghoſt woulde haue their names ſuppreſſed
and vnknowen, becauſe we ſhoulde
receiue all Scripture alike, and with the
ſame authoritie which proceedeth from the
mouth of God, making no differēce of perſons,
or choyſe of men, when all is trueth
that is written, and that we ſhoulde not conſider
ſo much, who ſpeaketh or writeth a
thing, as what is ſpoken &amp; written vnto vs.
Thus much for the writers of this worke.
Nowe let vs conſider the thing it ſelfe.
This Creede hath foure partes, the firſt
is of our faith, &amp; beliefe in God the Father,
the firſt perſon in Trinitie: the ſeconde is
of our truſt and beliefe in God the Sonne
Ieſus Chriſt our ſauiour, the ſecond perſon
in Trinitie: the third is of our faith in
the holy Ghoſt, the power of God, which
is the thirde perſon in Trinitie: the fourth
and laſt parte is of the holy and Vniuerſall
Church of Chriſt, and of thoſe things
that are to be beleued concerning the ſame,

which are contayned in the laſt three articles,
which are annexed and ioyned vnto the
Church, as The remiſſion of ſinnes, the reſurrection
of the bodie, and the life euerlaſting.
Theſe are the benefites which followe
the Church. This is the diuiſion of
the Creede. Out of the firſt article we haue
to note theſe two things: firſt that we muſt
beleeue in God: ſecondly, what maner of
God it is, in whome we doe beleeue. The
meaning of theſe wordes is this, I the ſeruant
and childe of God, I, I ſay, &amp; not another
for me, doe beleeue, hope and truſt in
one almightie, eternall &amp; euerliuing God,
which is not only a God of might vnto me,
to be able to do all thinges, but a moſt mercifull
father in Ieſus Chriſt, moſt willing
and ready to helpe me in al troubles and aduerſities
of this life, when I ſhall cry &amp; call
vnto him. Firſt therefore we learne here to
beleeue &amp; truſt in God only, and not in any
creature whatſoeuer, for they cannot helpe
vs, as Dauid ſayeth in his Pſalmes, Vaine
is the helpe of man. It is thou that ſaueſt
me from mine aduerſaries. And here note,
that there is a great differēce betwene theſe
three, to beleeue God, &amp; to beleeue there is a
God, &amp; to beleeue in God, the deuils beleue

the firſt &amp; the ſecond, that God is true of his
word and promiſe, which is, to beleeue God,
&amp; they alſo beleeue there is one God and no
moe, and tremble, as S. Iames the Apoſtle
ſayth, Chap. 2. 19. but they beleeue not the
third, that is, in God, which is as much as to
embrace &amp; acknowledge him for our good
God, and to ſticke to him, and to his worde
only. This is proper to the Elect &amp; children
of God, not to the deuils and reprobates,
which doe not truſt in him. For they lacke a
true iuſtifying faith, which is defined to be
a ſure truſt in the mercies of God &amp; his promiſes,
made vnto vs in Ieſus Chriſt his
Sonne, (by whom he hath adopted vs) that
he wil be mercifull vnto vs, &amp; forgiue vs all
our ſinnes. This is faith, &amp; this is it that we
muſt haue, when we ſay, I beleeue in God.
For faith muſt looke vnto God, &amp; not to any
man or angel, or ſaint in heauen. Therefore
Paul ſaid to the iayler, aſking howe he
might be ſaued, when he had abuſed &amp; cruelly
handled the Apoſtles,Actes 16. 
                     Beleeue, ſaieth he,
in the Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt
be ſaued. Surely he could not haue ſayde,
Beleeue in Chriſt, vnleſſe he had bene very
God: and marke howe he ſayeth not, Beleeue
Ieſus Chriſt, but, Beleeue in the

Lord Ieſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaued, as it is
ſayde here in our Creede, I beleeue in
God. This that we muſt beleeue in God, is
warranted by our ſauiour Chriſt, ſaying to
his diſciples, Beleeue in God, let not your
heartes be troubled, Iohn 14. So that this
doctrine to beleeue in God &amp; in no other, is
a doctrine of comfort to al the godly, and to
ſettle their hearts that they be not troubled
or caried away with vaine perſuaſions of
men and of Angels, which Paul forbiddeth,
Coloſ. 2. But here may a queſtion be made,
why we ſay not, as in the Lordes prayer in
the plurall number, Our Father, and forgiue
vs our treſpaſſes: ſo here alſo in like
ſort, why ſay we not, We beleeue in God?
Firſt I anſwere, that is a prayer to God, &amp;
this is a confeſſion of our faith. Then I ſay
the caſe is not all one or alike. For I may
pray for another man,1. Tim. 2. and am commanded
ſo to doe, becauſe we are al members of the
ſame body of Chriſt, ſo that my prayer may
helpe and profit him. But I can not beleeue
for another man, neither ſhal my faith
and beliefe profit another man, except he beleeue
him ſelfe the promiſes of Chriſt: for
euery man ſhall be ſaued by his owne faith,
as ye Prophet Habakuk ſaith, Chap. 2. The

iuſt man ſhal liue by his own faith. And this
notably confoundeth &amp; reproueth that fond
and falſe opinion of the papiſtes, which ſay
that it is inough to beleeue generally as the
church beleeueth, not knowing how or what
to beleeue. This ſentēce alſo reproueth and
conuinceth another hereſie of theirs which
ſay, that a man may be iuſtified by his owne
works. Here it is ſayd, The iuſt ſhall liue by
his faith, and not by his good workes or
deedes. And when Habacuk ſaith, his faith,
he meaneth not that faith is of our ſelues,
but that faith which doth ſaue vs, is within
vs in our hearts, &amp; not without vs in other
men, meaning neuertheleſſe, that faith commeth
from God aboue, and not of vs. As
Iames chap. 1. And this doth teach vs to apply
the mercies of God vnto our ſelues, ſaying,
I beleeue as well as other men, yt God
wil help me, &amp; be my father. This is a great
cōfort which the godly only haue, and not ye
wicked, as Dauid ſaith, The Lorde is his
Lorde as wel as he is a lord to other. Thus
much on whō we muſt beleeue, yt is, in God
only. Now ſecōdly conſider wt your ſelues
in what maner of god you doe beleeue and
truſt: not in ſuch a one as the Paynims did,
that could not help them, as Iupiter, Apollo,

Diana and ſuch like, which did appoint
a multitude of them to gouerne and guyde
the worlde, becauſe they thought that one
was not able ynough of himſelfe, and therefore
made one for heauen, as Iupiter, another
for the ſea, as Neptune. One for hell
as Pluto. One for the fire as Vulcan. Neither
are wee taught here to beleeue in ſuch
a god as the wicked Iſraelites did, called
Baal, which could not heare them when
they cryed vnto him, as it is in the booke of
the Kings, whō Elias reproueth, 3. Kings.
18. Chap. Of ſuch Idols and gods the Prophet
Dauid ſpeaketh, and derideth them &amp;
their worſhippers, Pſal. 115. Saying, they
haue mouthes and ſpeake not, eares and
heare not, eyes &amp; ſee not, noſes and ſmell
not, hands and handle not, feete and walke
not, neither make they a ſound with their
throte. Neither haue we ſuch pety gods of
ſtone and wood, as the papiſts haue their Images.
But our God in whō we do confeſſe
that we beleeue, is ſuch a one as is a father,
for his goodnes and mercie: and almightie,
for his ſtrength and power. This doth Dauid
meane, when hee doeth ſpeake of his
great God, and ſetteth him againſt al other
falſe gods of the idolaters, ſaying, as for

our God, he is in heauē. As if he would ſay,
he is a moſt mightie God, and both what ſoeuer
hee will, no man can hinder or let his
power. This as it is a great comfort to all
the godly, to haue ſuch a God to ayde them
at all neede, ſo it is a terror to the wicked
to conſider that they haue to doe with ſuch
a God as is omnipotent, able to beate them
to peeces and powder, when they reſiſt him.
As hee did mightily deſtroy Pharao, ſo did
hee wonderfully deliuer his people and
children the Iſraelites out of his handes,
from the read ſea. So he declared him ſelfe
an omnipotent father. We ſee then here as
in other places, how God ioyneth his power
and iuſtice to terrifie, and alſo his mercie
and clemency to comfort. I ſay they are put
both together, euen to terrifie the godly alſo,
yt they ſhould not commit ſinne, but feare
to offende ſuch a mightie Father. So it is
ſaid in the beginning of our prayer, Our father,
to comfort vs, but it is ſaid alſo, in heauen,
to magnifie his power &amp; greatnes ouer
al things. Likewiſe in the giuing of ye Law
it is ſaide, Heare O Iſrael, I am ye Lorde,
great &amp; terrible, no doubt, to put thē in mind
to feare him reuerently, and not to preſume
vpon him. But yet he addeth comfort afterward,

ſaying, Thy God, to deliuer thee hereafter,
which hath bene thy God already.
Thus we ſee that both muſt goe together,
Gods iuſtice, and Gods mercie, as Dauid
ſaid, Thy rod &amp; thy ſtaffe, they cōfort me,
Pſal. 23. Wee call him father, not in reſpect
of our creation, for ſo he is our Maker and
Creator: neither in reſpect of our gouernment,
for ſo he is our Lord and maſter: and
thoſe names are not ſo comfortable vnto vs,
becauſe hee is ſo, that is, a Lord and maker,
euen to the wicked and reprobate. But wee
call him father, firſt in reſpect of Chriſt,
which is his onely begotten and beloued
ſonne: Then in that we are his children adopted
in Chriſt our elder brother, which hath
made vs all ſonnes and children to his heauenly
father, by his death and paſſion, by his
obedience, by his fulfilling of the lawe, and
by his ſatiſfaction for our ſinnes, as Iohn
ſaith, Chap. 3. Behold what loue the father
hath ſhewed vnto vs, that we ſhould bee
called the ſōnes of God. This is a marueilous
comfort, yt the God of the whole earth,
the Lord of lords, is a louing father vnto vs.
And this is in Chriſt Ieſus, that wee haue
this dignity &amp; prerogatiue aboue others, not
in our ſelues, nor by birth and nature, for ſo

we are the ſonnes of Gods ire &amp; wrath, of
cōdēnatiō, becauſe of our ſinful father Adā,
tranſgreſſing Gods cōmandemēt. Whē we
name him almighty, we do not cōceiue him
to haue ſuch a power which he doth not vſe,
but in ſaying this, we confeſſe and acknowledge,
yt he hath al things &amp; creatures vnder
his power &amp; obedience, euen ye deuils themſelues,
as we ſee in ye Goſpel, how they ſubmitted
thēſelues to Chriſt ye ſonne of God,
&amp; how he aſked leaue, before he could do any
thing to Iob, Iob. 1. Again, we muſt needes
graūt, that being omnipotēt, and almighty,
he doth all things that are done, he ruleth &amp;
gouerneth heauen &amp; earth, the ſea and hel,
&amp; all things in them, the whole world at his
beck doth bend &amp; yeld it ſelf. So yt our God
being ſo mighty, is not an idle God in heauen,
as ye wicked do imagine, but diſpoſeth
al things by his iuſt &amp; wiſe prouidēce, howſoeuer
they fal out: nothing cōmeth to paſſe
wtout his wil and coūſel, no not the flight of
Sparrowes. Mat. 10. For if ye Lord ſhould
not vphold heauen and earth, yea the whole
world wt his power, it would fal to nothing,
to duſt &amp; aſhes: therefore it is ſaid, yt Chriſt
doth ſuſteine all things by the worde of his
might, Hebr. 1. And here our faith hath a

double cōfort, by ye prouidence &amp; omnipotē
                     cie
of God. Firſt becauſe it conſidereth, that
God hath ſufficient power to defende his
Church. Secōdly, becauſe he is willling to
do it. It foloweth, maker of heauē &amp; earth.
This proueth, yt he is almighty, becauſe he
hath made heauē &amp; earth of nothing, when it
was not, Gen. 1. And this doth notably confute
the wicked &amp; falſe opinions of ye Philoſophers,
as Plato &amp; Ariſtotle, who greatly
to ye derogation &amp; impairing of Gods glory
&amp; power, thought &amp; held that the world was
eternal frō ye beginnings, and neuer made,
neither ſhould haue ende. But this is falſe &amp;
blaſphemous againſt God. We learne here
another leſſon in our faith, that ye world was
made and had a beginning, and ſhall haue an
ending, as Moſes proueth the one, &amp; Peter
ye other, 2. Epiſt. 3. Chap. Now by making
of heauē and earth, we vnderſtand al things
conteined in heauen &amp; earth, as the ſea. For
Dauid ſaith, The ſea is his, and he made it,
95. Pſa. The things in heauē, as his angels,
ye things in earth, men, beaſts, fiſhes, foules,
worms, &amp; al other ſenſles creatures whatſoeuer.
It is therfore, as if we ſhould ſay, maker
of al things, viſible which we ſee, &amp; inuible
which we ſee not, as in ye Creed of ye coū
                     ſell

of Nice in more fully expreſſed. And
this was done, becauſe of the Heretikes
called ye Maniches, which did appoynt two
beginnings of things created, the one good,
which was God, and him they made the
beginner of all good thinges, the other they
imagined to be ill, which was the deuil, and
him they ſet ouer the euill things, and ſuppoſed
him the maker of them. But theſe
men were deceiued, which thought any ill
thing to be created and made ill at the firſt,
for the ſcripture doth otherwiſe pronounce
of al things, that they were exceeding good.
Geneſ. 1. But in that any thing is ill, it is
by deprauation and corruption, by the ſinne
of man, of Adam, and not by creation: for
the deuill was made an Angel, but he fell
and loſt his firſt eſtate, and ſo became a deuill
and wicked ſpirit by his owne corruption
and will, as Peter proueth. 2. Epiſtle
2. Chap. Nowe if the deuill made ſome
things, thē God made not al: but what ſaith
ye ſcripture? The Lord hath made al things
for his owne ſake: he ſaith not ſome things,
but al: nay he goeth further, &amp; addeth, euen ye
wicked for the day of euil. not yt he created
them wicked: for hee made them in Adam
perfit and good: but he hath appointed them

to ſerue to his honour and glory: although
they bee veſſels of wrath, he is glorified in
them after a ſort, although not ſo as hee
is glorified in the good. For therefore dyd
he ſturre vp Pharao King of Egypt, becauſe
he woulde ſhewe his glory vpon him,
Rom. 9. Seeing then God hath made heauen,
he hath made alſo all the ornaments of
heauen: as the heauenly ſpirits, the Sunne,
the Moone, the Starres to gouerne the
earth by their light. For in that we giue
him the creation of the greater, wee muſt
needes graunt the leſſer, and hee that can
make the great and huge heauens of nothing,
is able alſo to make the things conteyned
in them of leſſe importance. As concerning
the Angels, it is ſufficient for vs to
know, that they were all made of the Lorde
for his wil and pleaſure, to be his miniſtring
Spirites, to execute his commandementes
and iudgements againſt the wicked, and for
to ſerue for thoſe that ſhalbe heires of ſaluation,
Hebr. 1. It is but curioſitie to enquire
of the time of the creation, or of the orders
and eſtate in heauen. Moſes telleth vs a
good and ſhort leſſon, that heauen and earth
were made perfect in ſixe dayes, with al the
hoſtes and furniture of them, and ſaieth no

more of this matter, to teache vs ſobrietie
in theſe things, to wade no farther then we
haue the warrant of the worde to beare vs
out. Seeing all other vaine queſtions are
condemned of the Apoſtle Saint Paul,
Titus 3. The like is to be vnderſtoode in
making of the earth, to comprehende all
things in the earth, whatſoeuer I doe ſee,
heare, and vnderſtande. By the creation of
theſe thinges celeſtiall, and terreſtiall, I
doe conſider with my ſelfe theſe foure moſt
excellent and diuine vertues in God, which
comprehende all the reſt in them, and to
the which they may bee referred. Firſt by
the great and wonderfull creation of the vniuerſall
worlde, I learne to come to the
conſideration of his vnſpeakeable power
and greatneſſe,Potentia Dei. that he was able without
and payne or labour at all, yea with great
eaſe and pleaſure, to create heauē and earth,
with his onely worde, as the Prophet Dauid
ſayeth, He ſpake the worde, and it was
done. O what a great God is this, to be
feared ouer all the earth, for his wonderfull
greatneſſe and Maieſtie! This doeth
put vs in minde what a mighty God we do
ſerue, that wee may from our heart feare
him. The ſeconde thing to be conſidered in

this creation generall,Sapientia Dei. is his infinite and ineſtimable
wiſedome, in diſpoſing ſo orderly,
and placing ſo ſeemely all thinges in
their place and degree, as it is moſt wonderfull
to beholde, with ſuch beautie and
proportion in euery creature, that vnleſſe
we be too too blockiſhe, we muſt crye out
with Dauid and ſay, and confeſſe, O Lord,
howe wonderfull are thy workes: in wiſedome
haſt thou made them all. And againe:
Great is our Lorde, great is his power,
yea his wiſdome is infinite. To ſee the
goodly order of heauen, it will make a man
to be aſtonied at the wiſedome of his God,
more then the Queene of Saba was, when
ſhee came to ſee, and heare the wiſedome
of Solomon. For this wiſedome
by whome all thinges were made, is the
Sonne of GOD Ieſus Chriſt, the wiſedome
of his Father, Iohn 1. Hebr. 1. And
here we learne of this wiſedome, which he
hath vſed and ſhewed in the creation, a good
leſſon for our comfort, that as the Lorde
is almightie, and able to deliuer vs his
children, and Church from the wicked:
ſo doeth hee knowe the wayes and meanes
moſt perfitly and readily howe to doe it at
all times. For his knowledge paſſeth our

vnderſtanding farre. Therfore Peter ſaid,
The Lorde knoweth howe to deliuer the
godly out of tentation and trouble, and to
puniſh the wicked. 2. Pet. 2. So that when
man can finde no way, no deuice or meane
how to ſhift him ſelf out of daunger, yet the
Lord by his wiſedome and knowledge hath
diuers wayes to helpe. Diuers examples of
this are in the holy Scriptures: when Moſes
and the Iſraelites were ſo entangled
and compaſſed about, that there ſeemed no
way for them to eſcape, ſo that Moſes
prayed to the Lorde moſt earneſtly to deliuer
them, for he him ſelfe ſawe no meanes
howe to doe it, being on euery ſide on the
ryght hande and on the left, compaſſed in
with the hie hilles, before them was the
great redde ſea, behind them was the huge
hoſt of Pharao, ſo that nowe all hope of
life and ſuccour was taken away: then the
Lorde founde a way in the middeſt of the
ſea, to deliuer his people, and to drowne
his enemies: ſo he declared his wiſedome in
preſeruing them ſo miraculouſly. So likewiſe
when the virgin Marie dyd not ſee
howe ſhe ſhoulde conceyue and bring foorth
a ſonne being a mayde, and not knowing
any man, and therefore ſayde to the angel,

Howe ſhall this come to paſſe, ſo ſtrange
and rare a matter? the Lorde founde a readie
way howe he brought it to paſſe, that ſhe
conceiued by the operatiō of the holy ghoſt.
This made Solomon in his Prouerbs, to
ſay, Chapter 21. There is no wiſedome,
there is no vnderſtanding, there is no coū
                        ſell
againſt the Lord. For he ouerthroweth
the ſubtill fetches of the wiſedome of this
worlde, as of Ieroboam in his politike
counſel to make calues, &amp; of Achitophel in
his wilie practiſes. The Phariſees in their
ſnare that they had layde for our Sauiour
Chriſt, were taken them ſelues, to their
ſhame and reproche. Thus the Lorde ſcattereth
abroade the deuiſes of the wicked
kings and princes of this worlde, by his
wiſedome, for theirs is fooliſhneſſe to his,
1. Cor. 3. Saint Paul is rauiſhed with the
conſideration of this great wiſedome, and
cryeth out, ſaying, O the depth of the riches
&amp; wiſdome, and knowledge of God,
howe vnſercheable are his iudgements, &amp;
his wayes paſt finding our. Rom. 11. Wee
muſt then applie theſe things to our ſelues,
to receiue comfort and conſolatiō by them.
When we looke vp into heauen, &amp; downe
in the earth, or in the ſea, let vs thinke vpon

the wiſedome of the Lorde and glorifie him
in it, and ſay, O Lorde, howe wiſe art thou
in all thy doings, howe great is thy knowledge
vnto me: ſuch knowledge is too excellent
for me, it paſſeth my reache and capacities▪
So ſaide Dauid, ſaye vnto God,
O how wonderful art thou in thy workes!
Unleſſe we doe this, we are vnthankefull
beholders of Gods wiſedome, if we praiſe
him not for it. We may ſee it in our owne
ſelues, and in others euery day, in our creation
of our body and ſoule, howe wiſe and
wonderfull hee is. Theſe thinges we muſt
meditate vpon dayly and thinke, otherwiſe
we are no better then bruite beaſtes, which
ſee them onely and beholde them, but conſider
nothing in them. Here we learne our
duetie to our good God.
                  3 Thirdly in the creation of the worldeBonitas Dei.
we beholde as it were in a glaſſe, the goodneſſe
of God, his mercie towarde all men,
but eſpecially to the elect and choſen, that
for them, and their ſakes, he hath created
theſe things, and doeth dayly preſerue by
his prouidence euerye one of them, ſo that
hee hath not made them for him ſelfe, I
meane, that hee needed not any of them,
being all ſufficient in him ſelfe, moſt

happie and bleſſed, which is meant by his
name Shaddai, which ſignifieth that hee
is ſufficient of his owne nature. So that
a true Chriſtian man may ſay that his heauenly
Father hath made all thinges for his
vſe and benefite, heauen one daye to receiue
him, the earth to maynteyne him, all
creatures to ſerue him, the Sunne, Moone
&amp; Starres to lyght him, liuing creatures
to feede him and to recreate him, the angels
to keepe and to preſerue him in his
wayes, by his Fatherly appoyntment. O
what great benefites are here, that we receiue
of our mercifull Father by his creation
of all things! Here we learne our duetie
to be thankful to God for them, in the name
of Ieſus Chriſt his Sonne, to vſe theſe benefits
to his honour and glorie, to the profit
and commodity of his Church, and our
brethren here with vs. And here I ſee by
Gods goodneſſe and mercie towarde me,
that hee hath not onely created theſe things
at the firſt, but he doeth preſerue them euery
houre by his power: otherwiſe they
woulde vaniſhe away and come to nothing,
as Dauid ſayeth, If thou take away thy
breath from them, That is, his power
from his creatures, they dye. So that

here we ſee Gods prouidence ouer vs, and
all things. For he woorketh dayly by preſeruing
and keeping his creatures in their
eſtate, as Chriſt ſaith, My Father hitherto
woorketh, and I woorke, by maynteyning
things created. For God is not like a carpenter
that maketh an houſe, and ſetteth it
vp in deede, but afterwarde neuer peraduenture
ſeeth it againe, but leaueth it to the
dweller and owner of it, the maſter thereof,
and careth no more for it. If God ſhoulde
deale ſo with vs, it woulde be ill and wrong
with vs: for the deuill woulde dayly deſtroy
vs, if he did not keepe vs and all ours. For
we are not able to keepe our ſelues, no not
a minute of an houre. Here therefore acknowledge
in the mercie of God, his Fatherly
care and prouidence ouer vs and all
his creatures.
                  4 The laſt thing we learne of the creation
of the worlde, is the iuſtice of God, how
he gouerneth it rightly in equitie &amp; iudgement,
as the Prophet ſingeth, All the waies
of the Lord are iudgement &amp; equite. For
vnleſſe hee dyd execute his iuſtice vpon the
wicked, they woulde deſtroy his Church:
but he keepeth them vnder, as it were with
a bridle, and hampereth euen the proude

tyrants and deuils of hell, by his ſeuere iuſtice
ſhewed vpon them. So that the Lorde
is iuſt in all his wayes, yea his wil is a moſt
perfite rule and patterne of iuſtice. Dauid
often repeateth this leſſon, to terrifie the
wicked, Iuſt art thou, O Lorde, &amp; right are
thy iudgements, Pſalm. 119. So ſayde the
Emperor Mauricius, being killed by Phocas.
This do the wicked confeſſe thēſelues,
when they feele his heauy hand vpon them
for their ſinnes and offences, as Pharao did
when the hayle deſtroyed the cattell of Egypt,
ſaying vnto Moſes &amp; Aaron, I haue
nowe ſinned, the Lorde is righteous, but I
and my people are wicked, Exod. 19. Thus
the reprobate, whether they will or no, muſt
confeſſe the Lorde to be righteous in his
workes. For as the Lord is merciful to Forgive
the ſinnes of his children that are truely
penitent, and not obſtinate: ſo is he alſo
a moſt iuſt Iudge ouer all the earth, to execute
his ſharpe puniſhments vpon the malitous
and wilful ſinners. The Iudge of the
worlde doeth according to iuſtice, as Abraham
ſayde of him, when he was about to deſtroy
Sodoma, Gen. 18. I delite, ſayth the
Lorde, in iuſtice, mercy, and iudgement,
Ierem. 9. Examples of his iuſtice he hath

ſhewed in ye flood brought in vpon the wicked.
Example of his mercie, in ſauing Noe
and his familie: ſo that his iuſtice and mercie
goeth alwaies together, as Dauid ſaith,
I will ſing of mercie and iudgement, Pſal.
101. repreſenting the perſon of Chriſt,
which ſhould be in his kingdom, as wel iuſt
as mercifull: a Lion of the tribe of Iuda, to
teare in pieces the wicked, and a Lambe to
preſerue his with al gentleneſſe &amp; ſoftneſſe.
Looke vpon Sodome, how the Lord ſhewed
there his extreme and ſeuere Iuſtice vpō
thoſe miſcreants, to conſume them with fire
and brimſtone from heauen moſt terribly,
Gen. 19. and as Peter ſayeth, Made them
an example for all ages and poſterities to
come, of his iuſtice againſt ſinne and vncleannes,
2. Pet. 2. But yet then hee deliuered
iuſt Lot out of tentation and trouble.
Note his mercy in it, to the good &amp; godly.
I might heere recken vp the examples of
Sennacherib, of Achab, of Nabuchodonozor,
of Herode, of Iulian, and ſuch other
perſecuting kings and Emperours againſt
the Church of Chriſt: whome all God in
his iuſtice hath ouerthrowen and vtterly
deſtroyed. This we learne, that God doeth
alſo preſerue the ſtate of mankinde by his

iuſtice, that one doeth not ouerrunne another,
as wilde beaſtes. Then by this wee
learne to ſtand in feare of Gods iuſtice, if
we ſinne at any tyme deſperately, leaſt we
be caught vp with it, and ſuddenly conſumed,
If his wrath be kindled, yea but a litle,
bleſſed are al they that put their truſt
in him, Pſalme 2. For our God in his
wrath and iuſtice is a conſuming fire, as
Hebr. 12. And it is an horrible thing, to
fall into his handes. If he be angry, who
may abide or ſtande in his ſight, when the
hilles melte away, and the ſea is dried vp,
and the hard rockes cleaue aſunder? O that
we had this conſideration of his iuſtice before
our eyes continually, it would keepe
vs from all ſinne and vngodlines: for therefore
we ſinne, becauſe wee feare not this
iuſtice of the Lordes. There is no feare
of god (ſayeth Dauid of the wicked)
before their eyes, therefore they ſinne.
We ſee then what wee haue to note vpon
this article of our Chriſtian beliefe, and
what commodity commeth vnto vs of the
creation of all thinges by God, howe we
gather and conſider of his infinite greatneſſe,
by his wonderfull woorkes: for
the heauens declare the glory of God,

and ye firmament ſheweth his handy worke.
And this is one way to come to God, as to
be without excuſe before his tribunall ſeate
in the day of iudgement, when the ſecretes
of all heartes ſhall be diſcloſed, and all
thoughts opened before the Lorde. By this
creation the heathen men are without excuſe,
and haue knowen him generally, as
Paul ſayeth, Romanes the firſt chap. That
which may be knowen of God, is manifeſt
in them, for God hath ſhewed it vnto them.
For the inuiſible things of him, that is, his
eternall power and Godhead, are ſeene by
the creation of the worlde, being conſidered
in his workes, to the intent, that they ſhould
be without excuſe, becauſe that when they
knew God, they glorified him not as God,
neyther were thankefull, but became vayne
in their imaginations, &amp; their fooliſh heart
was full of darkneſſe: when they profeſſed
themſelues to be wiſe, they became fooles.
God is knowen three wayes, by his works,God is knowen three wayes.
by his worde, and by his holy ſpirit of adoption.
Although God be knowen by all theſe
wayes of his elect, yet he is knowen of the
reprobate onely by his worde and workes,
which ſee the workes, and heare his worde,
but neuer haue his Spirite directing them

aright, which is proper onely to his owne
children. Of the firſt way ſpeaketh Paul in
this place, vnto the which the creation is a
glaſſe, to bring vs to a full conſideration of
his greatneſſe. Wel, we learne by the creation
of heauen and earth, his power, his
wiſedome, his goodneſſe and iuſtice, and
whatſoeuer elſe may be in God. This is
great comfort to the godly, and bringeth
great boldeneſſe vnto them, and truſt in the
laſt day, that they haue ſuch a father, and do
beleeue in ſuch a God, as is maker of heauen
and earth: this teacheth vs our duetie, to
referre all our actions to his honour and
glory, to cōfeſſe him alone, to acknowledge
that he made vs, and not we our lelues, to
liue to him, to dye to him, to do al things for
his ſake, that hath made all for vs, as good
ſeruantes ſhould be more carefull of their
maſters honour &amp; profite, thē of their own.
Nowe let vs giue thankes to ſuch a God,
yt hath vouchſafed to giue vs faith to beleeue
in him, being ſo mightie a God, and we ſo
lowe and baſe children: ſo mercifull a father
vnto vs, notwithſtanding we are vnthankefull
ſonnes to him. And let vs praye vnto
him, to confirme this faith, and to encreaſe
it in vs euery day, till we come to a perfect

man in Ieſus Chriſt. Let vs deſire of him
to giue vs grace to behold this his wonderful
and diuine worke of his creation, wherin
hee hath ſhewed his wiſedome, power,
mercy, and iuſtice vnto al men, that we may
magnifie it (as it doth require) worthyly
with our heartes, and ſet forth his honour
and glory in theſe thinges, with thankes giuing
for all his benefites, ſeeing they appertayne
vnto vs, our bodyes and ſoules,
which are fed and nouriſhed by them. This
grace and mercy let vs deſire him to continewe
vnto vs, for his Chriſtes ſake our ſauiour,
who hath dearly bought vs: to whom
with the holy ghoſt his infinit power, three
perſons and one euerliuing God, bee
rendred all power, prayſe, glory,
honour, and thankeſgiuing,
both nowe and for
euer. Amen.
               
               
                  
                  The ſeconde Lecture vpon
the creede, which is vpon the ſeconde
article: And in Ieſus Chriſt his onely
ſonne our Lorde, which was
conceiued by the holy
Ghoſt.
                  
                     WE haue ſeene in the firſt article
going before, the thinges, which
we haue to beleeue as concerning
God the father in his creation:
now followeth conſequently what we haue
to beleeue of God the ſonne, Ieſus Chriſt,
as concerning his incarnation and all the
benefites of his death and paſſion, which is
the ſecond part of the creede, as we deuided
it. And here in this article you muſt vnderſtande
and repeate, as in the former, ſo in
this alſo: I beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt: that is,
I truſt in him, and put my whole confidence
in him, that hee is my onely ſauiour,
and that God will for his ſake forgiue
me all my ſinnes. For it is not ſufficient to
beleeue in God the father, &amp; to know him,
vnleſſe we alſo beleeue in his only begotten
ſonne Ieſus Chriſte our Lorde, and knowe
him alſo. As Iohn repeating the wordes of

our ſauiour Chriſt, ſaith, This is life eternal
that they know thee to be the onely very
God, &amp; whom thou haſt ſent, Ieſus Chriſt.
Ioh. 17. So that our ſauiour Chriſt ioyneth
and matcheth in one, the knowledge of him
ſelfe with the knowledge of the father, as he
ſayeth alſo in another place, Except ye beleeue
that I am he, ye ſhal die in your ſins.
We ſee then yt if we muſt beleeue in Ieſus
Chriſt, he is one God with the father, and a
creator, other wiſe it were idolatry to beleue
in any that is not God. And yt we may beleue
in him, this is warrāted vnto vs by his
owne commandement, ſaying in the 19. of
Iohns goſpel to his diſciples, Let not your
heart be troubled, beleeue ye in God, beleeue
alſo in me. A notable place to prooue
this matter. Where we may alſo learne, yt
if we beleeue in God, our hearts ſhal not be
troubled, nor wauer hither &amp; thither, not hauing
any place to reſt in. For therfore in our
miſeries &amp; dāgers are we vexed &amp; troubled
out of meaſure, becauſe we put not our full
truſt in the father &amp; the ſonne. Nowe let vs
ſee with what titles our Chriſt is beautified
&amp; adorned with, for our cōfort &amp; conſolation:
firſt of all, he is here called Ieſus, which
is an Ebrew word, &amp; ſoūdeth in Engliſh as

much as Sauiour, which name the Angell
gaue vnto him (by Gods appoyntment) before
he was conceaued in the wombe of the
virgin Mary his mother. As we reade notably
ſet forth vnto vs in the firſt of Matth:
Shee ſhal bring foorth a ſonne, and cal his
name Ieſus, or ſauiour: for he ſhall ſaue
his people from their ſinnes and offences.
And for this cauſe he came into the worlde,
as he teſtifieth of him ſelf: The ſonne of mā
came to ſaue that which is loſt, not to deſtroy
ſoules, but to ſaue, and to giue his life
a redemption for many, Luk. 19. By this we
learne, that there is no other Sauiour appoynted
for mā, either in heauē, or earth, but
only Ieſus: and they that wil haue ſaluation
of God the father, muſt haue it onely at his
handes. Therefore doeth the ſcripture pronounce
of him, that there is no other name
giuen vnder heauen vnto men, wherein they
muſt be ſaued, but only in the name of Ieſus
Chriſt. For this is the ſtone which is become
the head ſtone, and the chiefe in the corner,
neither is there any ſaluation in any other,
Act. 4. We haue then to ſeek our ſaluation
not in Angels, not in ſaints, not in men
or in our ſelues: but in him onely that hath
the key of Dauid, that ſhutteth heauen, and

no man openeth it, and openeth it, &amp; no man
ſhutteth. This is the firſt title of dignitie
and honour, that is giuen vnto him of his
father: the next is, that hee is called Chriſt,
which is a Greeke word, and ſignifieth in
Engliſh, Anoynted, which doth more plainly
&amp; effectually declare his office &amp; function
giuen him of the father for vs. For he was anoynted
for three eſpeciall purpoſes: firſt to
bee our Prophet to teach vs, ſecondly, our
prieſt to offer him ſelfe a ſacrifice for vs, and
thirdly, our king to rule &amp; to defēd vs from
our enemies. Theſe things are al giuē vnto
vs to vnderſtande in this name Chriſt. For
as al the Prophets, and prieſtes and kinges
in the time of the olde law, before the comming
of Chriſt, were anoynted with oyle by
the commandement of God, as God cōmanded
Elias to anoynt Eliſeus Prophet in his
ſtead, &amp; Moſes was cōmaunded to anoynt
Aaron hye prieſt, and Samuel to anoynt
Saul &amp; Dauid to be kinges: ſo was Chriſt
alſo anoynted, not with oyle materiall as
they, but with ſpiritual oyle of gladneſſe, as
Dauid ſaieth,Pſal. 45. 7. 
                     aboue his fellowes, yt is, with
ye holy ghoſt, aboue al mē, for he had it without
meaſure, Ioh. 3. 34. So then, as ye Prophets
&amp; prieſts, &amp; kings were all figures, &amp;

ſhadowes of Chriſt anoynted with oyle, to
ſignifie yt they muſt be gentle, meeke, &amp; ſoft
to al their brethren: ſo it was alſo neceſſary,
yt Chriſt ſhould performe al this yt was prefigured
by him. And firſt we ſee, yt Chriſt toke
vpon him the office of a Prophet, to teach ye
people his fathers wil, not thruſting in him
ſelfe as the falſe prophetes did, whom the
Lord ſent not at al, but being thereto lawefully
called &amp; authoriſed by his father from
heauen,Luk 9. 35. ſaying, Heare him, that is, to be our
doctour and teacher, our Prophete and
Scholemaſter. Being thus ordayned a
Prophet to teach vs, he executed his office
and calling moſt diligently, moſt paynfully
and faithfully: for he taught them in ſeaſon
and out of ſeaſon, earely and late, at home &amp;
abroad, by ſea and by land, as ye Euangeliſts
doe ſufficiently all of them record in their
goſpels, neither did he teach thē ye wil of his
father publikely in ye ſynagogues only, but
priuately alſo in families &amp; houſes: as when
he was receiued into Marthas houſe, he ſate
&amp; taught there Mary &amp; others: whereby wee
that are the Lordes Prophets &amp; miniſters,
may learne by this good exāple, howe carefully
&amp; readyly with al payne and diligence
to behaue our ſelues in the preaching of the

word of God his Goſpell, not to ceaſe at
any time, but to doe as he hath done before
vs. If then Chriſt be our Prophet (as Moſes
ſayth of him, A Prophet ſhall the Lord
your God rayſe vp vnto you of your brethren,
like vnto me: him ſhal you heare in al
thinges, that he ſhal ſpeake vnto you, Deut.
18.) we muſt heare him alone, &amp; not others
that teach falſe doctrine, as the papiſts: for
Chriſts ſheepe heare his voyce, Ioh. 10. We
learne againe, that no man beſide Chriſte,
was able to inſtruct vs in the will of his father,
but hee alone, as Iohn ſayth, Chap. 1.
No man hath ſeene God at any time: the
only begotten ſon of God, which is in the
boſome of his father, he hath reuealed him
vnto vs. Againe, we vnderſtand that al men
by nature are ignorant of the will of God, &amp;
their dutie, becauſe we haue neede of Chriſt
to informe vs in the right way, to leade vs
in the trueth, leaſt we be deceued with lyes.
For of his fulneſſe haue wee all receiued,
Ioh. 1. Therefore is he called of Eſay, The
angel of great Counſell, and that the ſpirit
of the Lord ſhould reſt vpon him, the ſpirit
of wiſedome &amp; vnderſtanding, the ſpirit of
Counſel and ſtrength, the ſpirit of knowledge
and of the feare of the Lord, Iſa. 11.

This is a great comfort to vs, to haue ſuch
a teacher and Prophet giuen to vs, as is
made to vs of God, wiſedome. 1. Corin. 1.
But the wicked can haue here no part at all
with him, for they do not heare his word and
voyce, neither wil they receiue his doctrine
&amp; inſtruction. Nowe we ſee how faithfully
Chriſt hath fulfilled this office of preaching,
as Marke ſayth of him, 1. Chap. Let vs goe
into the next Townes, that I may preache
there alſo, for I came out for that purpoſe.
The ende of this prophecie and teaching is,
that we ſhoulde bee made his diſciples and
ſchollers,Chriſts prieſt hoode. which God graunt vnto vs all. Amen.
The ſecond office that is in Chriſt for
his Church, is his prieſthode: for after hee
had taught the people, (which thing he firſt
tooke in hand) hee ſealed his doctrine with
his owne blood, and offered vp him ſelfe
a ſacrifice moſt perfect, ſweete and acceptable
to God his father, for vs al, to purge
vs from our ſinnes, to ſerue the liuing God.
For this alſo was the duetie of the prieſts in
the Leuitical lawe, that they ſhould offer ſacrifices
for the ſinnes of the people, &amp; pray
to God for them. This hath Chriſt fulfilled
by his death &amp; paſſion, which was ſo effectual
&amp; meritorious to take away ſinnes, yt the

father ſaith of him,Pſal. 110. 5. 
                     Thou art a Prieſt for euer,
after the order of Melchieſedech. Of
this ſacrifice ſpeaketh abundantly the Epiſtle
to the Hebremes, but eſpecially in the
9. Chap.Heb. 9. 14. ſaying, That Chriſt was once offered
to take away the ſinnes of many, and
to put away ſinne by the ſacrifice of himſelfe.
And againe, that the blood of Chriſt,
which through ye eternal ſpirit offered himſelfe
without fault to God, ſhall purge our
conſciences from dead workes to ſerue the
liuing God, ſo that nowe he is become our
mediatour betweene God &amp; vs, &amp; doeth appeare
in the ſight of God for vs. This is a
great comfort for vs. But we ſee in this ſacrifice
the vileneſſe &amp; greatneſſe of ſinne, &amp;
how lothſome &amp; deteſtable it was in Gods
ſight, that nothing in heauen or earth could
put it away or purge it, but the onely body
&amp; blood of Chriſt, this hie prieſt, moſt pure
and immaculate. This doth teach vs to abhorre
ſinne, ſeeing Chriſt payed ſo dearely
for it. And this driueth vs to cōſider how we
are indebted to our good ſauiour Chriſt, for
dying ſo mercifully for vs: ſo that wee are
worſe then beaſts, vnleſſe we giue him continuall
thanks for it. Nothing could pacifie
Gods wrath conceiued againſt our ſinnes,

but only his deare ſonne, for in him he was
wel pleaſed, Matth. 3. So that nowe wee
which were ſometime farre off &amp; ſtrangers
from the cōmon wealth of Iſrael, are made
neere by ye blod of Chriſt, to offer our ſelues
to him &amp; al ours, our prayers, our thanks, &amp;
yt with boldneſſe, without feare, as Zachary
ſayth, Luk. 1. The third office yt we conſider
in him, is his ſpirituall &amp; euerlaſting kingdom,
for ſpiritual it is, &amp; not carnal &amp; earthly,
as he himſelf ſaid to Pilate, My kingdō
is not of this world. And it is euerlaſting,
as ye Angel ſayde to Mary, He ſhal reigne
ouer the houſe of Iacob, &amp; of his kingdom
there ſhal be no end. So then he is a king,
as Zachary alſo ſayth, Behold, thy king cō
                        meth
vnto thee, meeke, O daughter Ieruſalem,
Chap. 9. This kingdom, he laſt of al
tooke vpon him, after that he had taught, and
offered vp him ſelfe, euen then when hee aſcended,
to ſit at the right hand of God: that
is, to haue all power and authority in heauen
and earth. This kingdome doeth conſiſt
chiefly in gouerning his electe, and his
Church by his holy ſpirite: for hee hath
gotten this kingdome for vs, becauſe hee
armeth vs with power to reſiſt ſinne, and
giueth vs of his princely treaſures &amp; gifts,

and wil at the laſt himſelfe lift vs vp thither,
and ſet vs with him in glory and honour, to
raine for euer &amp; euer, as he ſaith, It is your
fathers wil to giue you a kingdome, and he
that ouercommeth, ſhall ſit with mee in my
kingdome, as I haue ouercome, &amp; ſit with
my father in his kingdom. Reue. 3. Secōdly,
this kingdom of Chriſt doth beat downe
al force rayſed vp againſt his kingdome: as
the deuil, the Turke, the Pope, the wicked
ones of this world. Here he ſheweth himſelf
a mighty king ouer al the earth, to preſerue
his Church, hauing ſo many enemies. For
ſurely if he did not preſerue it, it would bee
ſwallowed vp euery houre, ſatan is ſo greedy
to deſtroy it. What they haue don againſt
it, we ſee, but they could neuer preuaile: for
this is a comfortable ſaying,Matth. 16. The gates of
hell ſhall not preuaile againſt it. Of this we
gather yt Chriſt ſhall euer haue his Church,
becauſe his power in his kingdom is infinit
to keep it: let ye wicked rage neuer ſo much,
yet Chriſt is king of ye whole earth, yea the
world. Thus much for his kingdō. It followweth,
his only ſonne. Here is declared vnto
vs, ye Ieſus Chriſt is the only ſonne of God,
&amp; therfore God, becauſe ye ſonne is of ye ſame
nature wt ye father: for he is one wt his father.

This is the third title giuen to our ſauiour
Chriſt, yt he is ye only begottē ſonne of God:
but there may a queſtion bee inade, How is
Chriſt the only ſonne of God, ſeeing we alſo
are ſōnes as he is, as Iohn ſaith, As many
as beleeue in Chriſt, he gaue thē power
to be ye ſōnes of God? To this we anſwere,
that Chriſt is the only ſonne of God by nature
&amp; ſubſtance: and we by grace &amp; adoption,
which before were not. For as when a
man hath no childrē, he maketh ſome by adoption
and fauor, whō he loueth, to enioy his
lands and inheritāce, 
                        •
                     ounting them as his
owne: ſo it is with God and vs. He hath no
moe ſonnes but one onely by nature &amp; ſubſtance:
but by his loue and grace he maketh
vs his deare children by adoption in Chriſt:
for all is done for Chriſtes ſake our elder
brother, as Paul proueth, Ephe. 1. He hath
predeſtinated vs to be adopted for ſonnes
in Ieſus Chriſt. For this then, that we are
ſonnes to ſo high &amp; great a God, a Lord and
king, ought we not to be very thankeful?
ought we not by all meanes to ſet forth his
honor &amp; glory more then our own? Surely
we ſhould do ſo: for how would I loue that
king here in ye earth, or that Queene, or that
noble mā that ſhould make me a poore begger

borne, his louing ſonne by adoption!
Now much more ought I to loue the ſonne
of God, yt hath made me ſonne to his father
by his death &amp; ſatiſfaction. And whē Chriſt
is called ye only begotten ſonne of God, we
muſt not imagine a carnall or groſſe begetting,
as is here among mē, but a diuine and
heauenly, incomprehēſible and vnſpeakable
to our capacity, before al beginnings, moſt
myſtical &amp; ſecret. The laſt title yt is giuē to
Chriſt here, is the dignity &amp; honor of a Lord.
We cal him our Lord, &amp; yt by right: for his
we are who hath bought vs, &amp; redeemed vs
by his owne body from the deuill &amp; ſinne, &amp;
al other euils and miſchiefes. And this is yt
that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, that therefore
Chriſt died and roſe agayne, that he might
be lord of al, both dead &amp; quicke, Rom. 14
and againe, Ye are not your own: for ye are
bought with a price, 1. Cor. 6. And therefore
is he made lord and king of his father ouer
all the world, that al ſhould worſhip and
honour the ſonne, as they honour the father
him ſelfe: for he is not only the head of men,
but of all the Angels in heauen, as it is ſaid,
Let all the Angels of God worſhip him,
Heb. 1. Ephe. 1. Thus ye ſee how Chriſt is
appoynted Lorde and heyre of all thinges:

therefore is he called here our Lord, and we
then confeſſe our ſelues to be his ſeruantes
and ſubiectes, to do his wil and commaundement.
He is called alſo our Lord, becauſe
we ſhould conceaue comfort by it in trouble,
that he will be a moſt gratious lord vnto vs
alſo, as wel as vnto others: as Thomas ſaid
of him, ſo muſt we ſay and bee perſwaded,
My God and my Lord. Iohn 21.
Which was conceiued by the holy Ghoſt.
                  
                  Nowe foloweth his cōceptiō by ye holy
ghoſt &amp; not by ye ſeed of man: for if he had bin
conceiued by man, he had not bene voyde of
ſinne, as Ioh chap. 3. ver. 6. Iob. 6. chap. 25.
verſe. 5, 6. and ſo ſhoulde he haue bene vnfit
to deliuer vs from ſinne. Therefore our ſauiour
ſaith, For them I do ſanctifie my ſelf.
And ſuch an high Prieſt it became vs to
haue, which is holy, harmeles, vndefiled, ſeperated
from ſinners, and made hier then
the heauens. As that which went before, did
proue vnto vs ſufficiently his diuinitie and
godhead, that he was yeſterday, to day &amp; for
euer, as is proued in the Epiſtle to the Hebrews,
cha. 13. ſo this cōception in ye wombe
of the virgin doth proue, that he is very and
true man, &amp; had a beginning according to
his humanitie, as the ſcriptures doe witnes

vnto vs, yt 
                     he was made of the ſeede of Dauid,
according to the fleſh. Rō. 1. And, that
God ſēt his ſōne into the world, made of a
woman, Gal. 4. The maner of this conception
is deſcribed liuely vnto vs by S. Luk.
Cha. 1. For after yt the Angel had told Marie,
that ſhe ſhould conceiue in her wōbe, and
bring forth a ſonne, and cal his name Ieſus,
ſhe aſked howe it ſhould come to paſſe, ſaying,
ſhe knew no man: then ye Angel telleth
her, that the holy ghoſt ſhould come vpon
her, &amp; the power of y• moſt high ſhould ouerſhadow
her: therefore that holy thing which
ſhalbe borne of thee, ſhal be called the ſonne
of God. So likwiſe in Matth. 1. we reade,
that when Ioſeph her huſband would haue
put her away priuily, thinking ſhe had bene
with child of ſome mā: the Angel called vnto
him being thus minded, in a dreame, ſaying,
Ioſeph, thou ſonne of Dauid, feare not
to take Mary for thy wife: for that which is
conceiued in her, is of ye holy ghoſt. We ſee
then that al fleſh in Adam had corrupted his
way before the Lord, &amp; that the ordinary generatiō
of mā was vncleane, therfore it was
neceſſary that Chriſt that ſhould redeeme
others from ſinne, ſhould not be ſubiect to it
himſelf, but bee borne by an extraordinarie

meane, to cleanſe vs frō all our ſinnes, both
original &amp; actual, which he was voyde of by
reaſō of this cōceptiō: wherfore Chriſt muſt
be both mā &amp; God to redeeme vs: Man, becauſe
mā had offended, &amp; our ſinnes had deuided
him frō vs, as a cloude doth the bright
ſunne from our eies: &amp; he muſt be God alſo,
to make reconciliatiō to God his father for
vs: for no Angel in heauen was able to do
this office of mediation, but the only God &amp;
mā Ieſus Chriſt ye true mediator, for al our
ſinnes paſt, preſent, or to come. Here cōſider
the great loue of Chriſt toward mankinde,
yt deſpiſed not our fleſh, to take it vpō him,
beeing God equall to his father, and hath
inueſted and couered himſelfe with our nature,
but yet without ſinne. This doth teach
vs our duety towards him in thākfulnes, &amp;
our duty towards our neighbors in yelding
vnto them in matters for their behalf, &amp; not
to pleaſe our ſelues, but to beare with them,
&amp; debaſe our ſelues for them, as Chriſt hath
done for vs already. Phil. 2. Let the ſame
minde be in you, which was in Chriſt Ieſus.
We learne by the cōceptiō of Chriſt by
the holy ghoſt, that he was thus cōceiued, to
make our ſinfull conception pure: For we
are conceiued and borne in ſinnes euery one

of vs, euē the beſt of vs al, yt come of Adam.
Dauid lamenteth ye impurity &amp; imperfection
of his conception and birth, ſaying, Behold,
Lorde, I was borne in iniquitie, &amp; in
ſinne hath my mother conceiued me, Pſal.
51. as if he would ſay, The cauſe of this my
outward ſinne &amp; actual, as murder &amp; adultery,
is, that I was conceiued in ſinne, and can
doe nothing els of my ſelfe but ſinne euery
houre: as Paul alſo cōplaineth of himſelfe,
Rō. 7. O wretched mā that I am, who ſhal
deliuer me frō the bodie of this death? and
then cōmeth vnto Chriſt, &amp; thanketh him, yt
he hath deliuered him from it. We haue thē
to cōfort our ſelues in this, that Chriſt was
conceiued for vs, borne for vs, &amp; died for vs,
&amp; whatſoeuer he did, he did it for our profite
and cōmodity. In that that Chriſt was conceiued,
we alſo vnderſtand ye verity of Gods
promiſes made vnto vs in ye prophtes, which
had lōg before prophecied of it: As in Eſai. 7.
Behold, ſaith he, A virgin ſhall conceiue &amp;
beare a ſonne, and ſhe ſhall call his name
Immanuel. So we gather, that God hauing
perfourmed this, he is alwayes iuſt &amp;
true in his promiſes yt he maketh to a thouſād
generatiōs. And furthermore yt 
                     the Prophets
ſpake not by their own wil, (as Peter
ſaith) but by the wil &amp; ſpirit of God, euen

as they were led &amp; moued by ye holy ghoſt,
2. Pet. 1. So ye whatſoeuer God ether ſpeaketh
or promiſeth to ye good &amp; godly to their
comfort, it ſhal come to paſſe: as here in Eſai
God promiſeth ye cōceptiō of Chriſt for a cō
                     fort
to Hieruſalē beſieged w̄t her enemies,
whē Achaz was king, Eſa. 7. Likewiſe on ye
contrary part, whatſoeuer the Lord of hoſts
threatneth to the wicked &amp; deſtroyers of his
Church, ſhal alſo in due time be fulfilled and
accōpliſhed to ye vttermoſt, as vpō ye Iewes
for murdering of Chriſt,Luke 19. &amp; vpon ye Romane
Emperours, for going about to ouerthrow
his cōgregatiō &amp; flock. Although it be many
times long before the Lord doth either deliuer
ye godly, or puniſh ye reprobate, yet it is
moſt ſure &amp; certaine, becauſe his mouth hath
ſpokē it, yt can not lie or deceiue, as Balaam
ſaith of him, Hath he ſpoken, &amp; ſhal he not
performe it, &amp; ſaid it, &amp; ſhal he not make it
good? That were vnpoſſible. When we
ſay that Chriſt was conceiued in the wombe
of the virgin Marie his mother, by the operation
and worke of ye holy ghoſt, we meane
that to bee ſpoken according to his humanitie
only, and not according to his diuinitie:
for ſo hee is likened to Melchiſedech,
without father as touching his fleſh, &amp; without

mother as concerning his godhead, and
yet we ſay, yt Chriſt was conceiued, becauſe
Chriſt both God &amp; mā, was ioined together
in one perſon. Therfore we muſt wiſely diſtinguſh
&amp; make a differēce betweene y• two
natures &amp; properties of Chriſt, his māhod &amp;
Godhead. Whē Chriſt ſaith, he can of him
ſelf do nothing, he iudgeth no mā, he knoweth
not the day of iudgemēt, &amp; that ye father
is greater thē hee, with ſuch like ſentē
                     ces
in yt Goſpel, you muſt vnderſtand theſe
things to be ſpokē as he was only man. In
yt he ſaith he was before Abraham, and ye father
and he are al one, and that the ſcripture
termeth him, The firſt begottē of all creatures,
the lord of al things, the brightnes of
his father: theſe ſayings are all applied to
Chriſt, as he is the ſonne of God, and God
himſelfe, that made al things, as Iohn ſaith
of him, By him al things were made. If we
marke &amp; obſerue theſe two points, the diuinity
of Chriſt, &amp; his humanity, we ſhal finde
great light and eaſines in reading the newe
teſtament: and things which were hard before,
wil ſeeme plaine &amp; euident vnto vs by
this rule. Thus haue ye heard the meaning
&amp; the good leſſons that may be gathered out
of this 2. article of our chriſtiā faith, y• cōception
moſt pure &amp; moſt cleane of our ſauior

Ieſus Chriſt. Firſt, that he was conceiued,
as the word doth teſtifie. Secondly, wherefore
he was conceiued: which was, becauſe
he might become very man to redeeme and
ſuffer for man, offending the maieſtie of the
almightie God. Nowe let vs giue moſt hū
                     ble
and heartie thankes as we are bound, to
this Ieſus Chriſt, y• being ſo hie, he woulde
vouchſafe to deſcende ſo lowe for vs poore
wretches, as to be conceiued in the wombe
of a maide to make vs pure: and let vs alſo
pray vnto his Maieſtie, yt ſeeing his conceptiō
is pure &amp; vnſpotted, he would alſo make
ours ſo to be, with the free imputatiō of his
conception &amp; all other benefites of his death
and paſſion, &amp; that he would kill ſinne in vs
more and more daily, by his ſpirit of ſanctification,
that we may liue here in righteouſnes
and holines before him without feare, al
the daies of our life, &amp; whē the ſinfull courſe
of this trāſitorie life is ended, we may haue
that life which neuer ſhall haue ende, whoſe
ioyes neither eye hath ſeene, nor eare hath
heard, nor heart of mā can poſſibly conceiue
or thinke: which God grant vnto vs for his
Sonne Chriſts ſake: to whom wt the holie
ghoſt, be rendred al power, dominiō, praiſe
and thankeſgiuing, both now and for euer.
So be it.
               
               
                  
                  The third Lecture vpon
the third Article of our Chriſtian
fayth, which is, Borne of the
virgin Marie.
                  
                     IN this article is mentioned
and ſet downe vnto vs the natiuitie
and birth of our Sauiour
Ieſus Chriſt, how that
he was borne, not after the cō
                     mon
ſort of men, but of a maide or virgin,
not a married woman which knewe any
man: ſo that the meaning of this article in
moe wordes is this, I that am a Chriſtian
man or woman, doe beleeue alſo, that as
Ieſus Chriſt was conceyued by the holy
Ghoſt, ſo was he borne likewiſe for mee of
his mother Marie, ſhe notwithſtanding remayning
ſtill a virgin. Out of the which
article we haue to note theſe three good leſſons
and poyntes for our inſtruction and
conſolation. Firſt, the birth it ſelfe, ſecondly,
the maner of it, with all the circumſtances
of the ſame, thirdly, the profit and commoditie
that we may reape by it, beleeuing
it truely as we ought to doe.
                  1 As concerning his birth, Eſai in his
ſeuenth and ninth Chapter ſaith, The Lord
him ſelfe ſhall giue you a ſigne. Beholde,

a virgin ſhall conceiue and beare a Sonne,
and ſhe ſhall call his name Immanuel:
butter and honie ſhall he eate, till he haue
knowelege to refuſe the euil, and to chuſe
the good. Likewiſe the ninth Chapter:
Vnto vs a childe is borne, and vnto vs a
ſonne is giuen, and the gouernment is vpon
his ſhoulder, and he ſhal call his name,
Wonderful, Coūſeller, The mightie God,
The euerlaſting Father, The Prince of
peace: the increaſe of his gouernment and
peace ſhal haue no end, he ſhal ſit vpō the
throue of Dauid, and vpon his kingdome,
to order it, and to eſtabliſh it with iudgement
and with iuſtice, from henceforth euē
for euer. The zeale of the Lord of hoſts
will performe this. Thus we ſee howe euidently
Eſai long before propheſied of this
birth, to the comfort of ye people in his time.
The like thing doeth Ieremie alſo declare
vnto vs in his propheſie, of this wonderful
natiuitie of our Sauiour Ieſus, ſaying in
his Chap. 23. Behold, the daies come, ſaith
the Lord, that I will raiſe vp vnto Dauid a
righteous branch, &amp; a king ſhal reigne &amp;
proſper, &amp; ſhal execute true iudgement &amp;
iuſtice vpō the earth. In his daies Iuda ſhal
be ſaued, and Iſrael ſhall dwell ſafely: and
                     
fulneſſe of time, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh,
was come, then God ſent his Sonne made
of a woman, and made vnder the Lawe,
that he might redeeme them which were
vnder the Law, that we might receiue the
adoption of ſonnes, Gal. 4. God then, as in
this, ſo in all other things, is true and iuſt of
his promiſe and couenant, that he maketh
to a thouſand generatiōs, as ſaith the Prophet.
For nothing can let him, to bring his
words to paſſe, his power is infinit &amp; ouer
all. And although it be ſaid that Marie was
maried to Ioſeph, &amp; Ioſeph tooke her home
to him to be his wife, yet ſhe was a virgin,
for Ioſeph knewe her not: ſo yt Chriſt was
borne of her being a virgin, &amp; Ioſeph was
ſpouſed to her in this reſpect, that he ſhould
be an aide and comfort for her in her trouble
and paine, in her flight into Egypt, &amp; in her
great pouertie: for ſhe was ſo poore, that
ſhe had no chamber to be deliuered in, but
laid our Sauiour Chriſt in a manger. For
theſe cauſes, was Ioſeph called her huſbande
alſo, that ſhee myght be voyde of ſuſpition
of fornication, and Chriſt not
thought to be borne out of wedlocke, or in
adulterie.
                  2 Secondly, for our inſtruction let vs

conſider the whole maner of Chriſts birth,
after what ſort and faſhion it was. S. Luke
doth declare ye order of it very liuely, &amp; ſaith,
yt 
                     whē Ioſeph &amp; Mary were at Bethlehem,
the dayes were accompliſhed that ſhee
ſhoulde be deliuered, &amp; ſhe brought forth
her firſt begotten ſonne, and wrapped him
in ſwadling clothes, and layde him in a
cratch or manger, becauſe there was no
roume for thē in the Inne. By theſe words
we ſee the maner of Chriſts birth, howe it
was very poore and baſe in reſpect of the
world, &amp; nothing glorious in ye eies of men,
or as myght beſeeme ſo great a prince as
he was. He that might haue bene borne in a
moſt magnificent and royall palace, would
be borne in a ſtable or oxe ſtall, and he which
could haue bene layde in a moſt ſumptuous
bed of doune, with ſilke &amp; veluet wrought &amp;
garniſhed, yet notwithſtanding woulde bee
layde in a vile manger. This doth paſſe the
reach and capacitie of mans witte, and doth
expreſſe vnto vs, how that the Lords waies
are not our wayes, nor his doinges as
ours are: For then ſurely woulde hee not
haue had Chriſt his Sonne to bee borne ſo
poorely, and without al honour and eſtimation
here in the earth. But here we ſee the

great loue of Chriſt towardes vs, ye woulde
ſo be borne for our ſakes. So that in this is
fulfilled that notable ſaying if S. Paul the
Apoſtle. 2. Corinth. 8. Chap. 9. ſaying, Ye
know the grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, y•
he beīg rich, for your ſakes became poore,
yt ye through his pouertie myght be made
rich. A notable leſſon to take pouertie in
good part, if ye Lord for iuſt cauſes lay it vpon
vs. And not only was he borne ſo poorely
&amp; miſerably, but alſo liued ſo afterwarde
all his life time, while he was here vpon the
earth, for yt ſpace of 2. or 3. and thirty yeres,
inſomuch that when he was borne, he ſtedde
into Egypt frō Herod yt ſought to kil him,
no doubt with trouble &amp; paine. Afterward,
he liued with the beneuolence &amp; liberalitie
of certaine good womē, as of Mary Magdalene,
&amp; Ioanna yt wife of Chuza Herods
ſtewarde, &amp; Suſanna, &amp; many other which
miniſtred vnto him of their ſubſtance, Luk.
8. 3. ſo yt he himſelfe doth pronounce to one
that would folow him for gaine &amp; eſtimatiō
in this life, yt the ſonne of mā, meaning him
ſelf, hath not where to lay or hide his hed,
but is in worſe caſe thē ye foxes which haue
holes, or ye birds of ye aire which haue their
neſts, Mat. 8. By this we learne to take pouerty

patiently, which the Lorde himſelfe
hath ſanctified in his owne body, neither
to thinke it accurſed. And we learne thereby
the contempt of this worlde, for Chriſt
had nothing glorious in the face and eyes
of man, hee was not riche, but poore. If
wee haue riches, let vs not thinke ſo
much, or highly of them, or be puffed vp
by them: for Chriſt had them not. If
wee be poore, let vs remember that Ieſus
Chriſt was poore alſo in this life. It
is ſufficient for vs, and enough, if we
may be riche after this life, not that theſe
riches and worldly thinges are ill, if
they be vſed to Gods glory, but Chriſt
would teache vs by his example, that firſt
his kingdome is not of this world, &amp; then
not to be greeued if we lacke theſe tranſitorye
thinges, for hee had them not at all:
wherefore if we haue meate and drinke and
raiment, we muſt be content. The circumſtances
of his birth, are the place of it, and
the tyme. As concerning the place, Matthewe
and Luke both agree in one, that it
was Bethlehem, for ſo was it long before
prophecyed of by the Prophet Micheas.
Chap. 5. ſaying, And thou Bethlehem Ephrathah,
art little to be among the thouſands

of Iuda, yet our of thee ſhall come
foorth vnto me, one that ſhalbe the ruler
in Iſrael, whoſe goings foorth ſhall be
from the beginning and from euerlaſting.
Where hee ſetteth foorth vnto vs plainely,
both the humanitie of Chriſt, and alſo
his diuinitie: his humanitie, in that
hee ſayth, hee came out of Bethlehem:
and his diuinitie, in that his going foorth
was from euerlaſting. The place then
was Bethlehem: no great and famous
citie as Ieruſalem was, but a poore and
obſcure towne, nothing ſpoken of among
men. Here wee may ſee againe, that as
Chriſt ſhewed great humilitie in the maner
of his birth, ſo did hee alſo in chuſing
ſo poore and vile a place as Bethlehem
was. And this was done no doubt to confound
the wiſedome of the wiſe and mightie,
which woulde haue thought rather
that Chriſt ſhould haue bene borne at
Ieruſalem, or ſome ſuch like notable
and excellent citie. Well, our ſauiour
Chriſt choſe Bethlehem, and made it famous
through his birth, and reiected all
other cities: ſo is fulfilled that ſaying of
Paul, God hath choſen the weake things
of the worlde, to confound the ſtrong,

and vile things, and things that are deſpiſed
hath God choſen, to bring to naught
the thinges that are, that no fleſhe ſhoulde
reioyce in his preſence. 1. Corinthians
1. Verſes 27. 28, 29. Let no man therefore
be grieued or aſhamed, if he be borne
in a poore and baſe village, for ſo was
Chriſt borne, and hee is nothing the
worſe for it: hee may come as ſoone to
heauen, as they that are borne in the greateſt
cities. Neither let any man on the
contrarye, bragge and boaſt himſelfe, if
hee were borne in a famous place: this
maketh him not the better, or neerer to
God. Wee may ſee alſo at this day, where
Chriſt is moſt commonly to be founde:
not in great cities, and princes courts
ſo much, as in poore places, and obſcure
houſes. The wiſe men ſought him at
Ieruſalem the great citie, but Chriſt
was found in poore Bethlehem. Here
alſo learne, that the prophecies are fulfilled
ſtill: for Chriſt, as they had ſayed,
was borne in Bethlehem. Let vs therefore
beleeue the Prophets, either when
they comfort vs, or threaten vs for
ſinnes, for they ſhall alwayes be fulfilled.
The time of our Sauiours

birth was in the dayes and raigne of Herode
the king, as Saint Matthewe ſayth,
Chapter. 2. and ſo had Iacob propheſied
before, that Chriſt ſhould not be borne,
vntill the kingdome did ceaſe, and depart
from the race of the Iewes, and was gito
the nation of the Romanes, as Geneſis.
49. The ſcepter ſhall not depart
from Iuda, nor a Lawegiuer from betweene
his feete, vntil Shiloh come, and
the people ſhalbe gathered vnto him.
Meaning that Chriſt ſhould not be borne
and come among the Iewes, vntill ſuch
time as they had no kinges to rule among
them of their owne ſtocke, but of
ſtrangers, as Herode was at that time.
Chriſt beeing borne in the tyme of king
Herode, a wicked king, and a Tyrant,
doeth ſhewe himſelfe moſt fauourable
to the Iewes his people, being in great
bondage and miſerye. For when They
had moſt neede of a Sauiour and redeemer,
not only of their bodyes, but eſpecially
of their ſoules and conſciences, religion
being corrupted among them, and his word
reiected, then I ſay, Chriſt came, and was
borne a deliuerer vnto them. So is God
wont to deale in mercy toward his children,

then, and not before to ſende helpe,
when they are at the laſt caſte, and ready
to be deuoured, to teache them, that
when there is no helpe and ſuccour
in them ſelues, then is there moſt preſent
ayde and comfort in him as hee ſayde
to Paul, My power is made perfect, and
is ſtrong in weakeneſſe, that when wee
are moſt weake and feeble, then is God
moſt ſtrong to deliuer vs from our enemies.
He neuer deliuered the Iſraelites
out of Egypt, vntill they were
brought to the extremytie, then hee ſent
them Moſes, and Aaron, and not before:
for hee will humble man, and let him to
vnderſtand, that when hee doeth any thing
for him, and deliuer him, or beſtowe any
gift vpon him in bodye or ſoule, it is
not for any thing that is in him, but
of his meere mercy and goodneſſe, to
make his praiſe the more to be ſeene,
and men more thankefull vnto him.
Let his praiſe therefore be continually in
our mouthes, and let vs magnifie his
name together, as ſayeth the Prophet
Dauid, Pſalme. 103. Chriſt then viſited
the Iewes, when all thinges were
turned vpſide downe, his ſeruice was defaced

by the traditions of men, as the
Scribes, and Phariſes, and Sadduces,
who had corrupted the puritye of Gods
worde and doctrine, and brought in their
owne pelfe and maners, were altogether
vnreformed, the poore neglected,
the Prophetes deſpiſed, and Gods laue
ſet at nought. So that when our Sauiour
came amongſt them, hee reſpected
not any thing hee ſawe in them, but
their extreeme miſerie and thraldome,
which moued him to pitye them, and
ſo much the more, becauſe they had
ſuch a cruell Tyrant to rayne ouer them,
as murdered a great many of their
young infantes. So the Lorde came
amongſt vs of late: when his Goſpell
was layed aſide, and deuices of men, in
ſteade of it, were ſet vp, when his miniſters
were in euery place perſecuted, and burned:
then he ſent a deliuerer to purge religion,
to reſtore his trueth againe, to
pull downe Antichriſt, and to aboliſh
Poperie: hee reſpected not any thing in
vs, for wee like ſheepe were all gone
aſtray, euery man turned his owne
way: but hee did this, being mindefull
of his mercy and promes made

freely vnto vs in Ieſus Chriſt: I pray
God wee may bee all truely thankefull,
for ſo great and wonderfull a benefite
beſtowed vpon vs, as the like was neuer
ſeene in our lande before. Surely good
cauſe wee haue to remember the Lorde
in our beddes, that giueth vs in the middeſt
of our enemies, ſuch quietnes and reſt
from all perils and dangers. The thing
that followed immediately vpon this birth
of our ſauiour, was the comming of certayne
wiſe and famous men from the
Eaſt to worſhippe him, being ledde with
an extraordinary ſtarre thereunto. Thus
God the Father woulde adorne and
magnifie the birth of his ſonne, with
the reſort of theſe great and excellent
men. And herein no doubt they being
Gentiles, and the firſt fruites of them,
that came to our Sauiour, doe ſignifye
that the Gentiles alſo aſwel as the Iewes,
ſhoulde be called to be the people of
God, that there might be one folde and
one ſhephearde, as our Sauiour telleth
vs in the tenth Chaper of Iohns Goſpel.
This was comfortable for vs, being Heathen
men and Gentiles, and altogether
ſtrangers from God, to be made

the peculiar people of God, and to be
tranſlated from the kingdome of darkeneſſe,
into the euerlaſting kingdome and
inheritance of his welbeloued ſonne. But
ſee howe the declaration and ſhewing of
this birth of ſo wonderfull a king, by the
wiſemen, was taken of Herode and the
Iewes in Hieruſalem: when they heard
the king of the Iewes to be borne, it is
ſayde, that Herode and all Ieruſalem
was troubled with him. Thus wee ſee the
nature and condition of the wicked, that
when they ſhoulde be glad, and reioyce in
the Lorde with thankeſgiuing for his
benefites, then they are troubled, they
murmure, and are vnthankefull. Here
all Ieruſalem had great occaſion giuen
them to prayſe God, and they conſider
not of it a whit, they had rather
ſleepe in their dregges of ſinne.
May, Herode went about to kill him,
that came to dye for him, and to ſaue
him, if hee coulde haue beleeued it. This
doeth alſo reproue our maner and doings
at this day: for when wee ſhould yeeld
God prayſe and thankes, wee giue him
none, and when he is moſt ready to doe
vs good, either wee conſider not of it,

or elſe vnthankfully refuſe it, as the ſwiniſhe
Gergeſites did. Howe hath Chriſt
viſited vs in mercy, in giuing vs his holy
Goſpel the foode of our ſoules, as much
as euer hee did to the Iewes? and yet I ſay
wee are troubled ſtill in our mindes and
ſoules, with ye cares of this world, which do
choke the ſeede of his holy word. Wel (dearly
beloued) let vs learne to be wiſe, and to
conſider thankfully of Gods benefites in
time, leſt they be takē from vs, as they were
from the Iewes, and giuen to a nation that
ſhal better receiue them, and make greater
account of them. The third thing yt I ſaide
was to be conſidered in the birth of our ſauiour
Ieſus Chriſt, is the profite and comfort
yt we may take &amp; apply to our ſelues,
our ſoules and bodyes by it, and what duetie
is required of vs in this behalfe. The
commoditie that ariſeth to vs and al Chriſtians
by his birth, is, that Chriſt came to
ſaue that which was loſt, as Paul doth notably
expreſſe the ende of his comming in
the fleſhe, ſaying, This is a true ſaying, and
by all meanes woorthy to bee receyued,
that Ieſus Chriſt came into this worlde to
ſaue ſinners, 1. Timothie 1. 15. Then
we perceiue this, that Chriſt was borne to

redeeme vs. If he had not bene borne, wee
could not haue byn redeemed by him from
the power of hell, and of Satan. This is a
great matter, and a moſt excellent &amp; wonderfull
benefite. For we vnderſtande now
plainly &amp; clerely by the word of the Lorde,
that the ſeede of the woman hath broken ye
ſerpents head, Gen. 3. that there is a Lion
and a Lambe in diuers reſpectes, for his
ſtrength a Lion, and a Lambe by his meeknes,
found worthy to open the booke, &amp; to
looſe the ſeuen ſeales of it, which no man
was able to doe, neither in heauen nor in
earth, nor vnder the earth, Reuel. 5. that
there is a childe, as Eſaie ſayth, giuen vnto
vs, vpon whoſe ſhoulders the gouernmēt
of heauen and earth is laide, and doth cō
                        ſiſt.
We may ſaye therefore, that a man is
borne of the virgin Marie, the true and naturall
ſonne of Adam, of Abraham, of Dauid,
which was promiſed in the lawe and
Prophets, ſuch a man I ſay, that hath conquered
hell and death, and damnation, &amp; deſiuered
vs from the wrath of his father to
come. Of this, our faith may gather a double
fruite and cōmodite; the one, that there
is a mediatour betweene God &amp; man, euen
the man Ieſus Chriſt: we haue this mediator

for vs in heauen already: the other, yt by
the participation &amp; vnitie of his nature wt
ours, he receiueth &amp; admitteth vs into the
ſocietie of him ſelfe, and all his riches and
treaſures are made ours, euen as the wife
may ſay of her huſband, that al her huſbāds
goods &amp; lands are hers, becauſe ſhe is one
with him: ſo may we ſay of our moſt gratious
huſband &amp; bridegrome Ieſus Chriſt,
that all his ſtore is now become ours: For
we are bones of his bones, and fleſh of his
fleſh, as Paul telleth vs plainly, Epheſ. 5.
If this be ſo, then wee ought to reioyce
and be glad in our heartes, as Paul ſayth,
which is, in the Lorde, becauſe that Chriſt
the great iewell of God is ſent into the
worlde. If we greatly reioyce &amp; triumphe,
when wee haue a mortall ſonne an heyre
here borne in earth vnto vs, whō we knowe
not whether he ſhall be good or ill, a cōfort
or paine vnto vs: If (I ſay) we do reioyce at
this vanity, what ought we to do (think ye)
dearly beloued brethrē, whē we heare yt ſōne
of God to be borne for vs, &amp; the heire of all
things, a ſonne that pacifieth his fathers
wrath iuſtly conceiued againſt ſinne, ſuch a
childe as maketh vs children, &amp; bringeth vs
into his heauenly poſſeſſion &amp; inheritance?

Ought we not (trow you) vnſpeakeably to
reioyce, &amp; thanke God and his ſonne Chriſt
continually? It is good reaſon ſo to do, ſeeing
it is our onely benefit, and not his: for he
came and was borne for vs, and not for him
ſelfe. The angels of God herein may teach
vs our duety, howe thankfull we ought to
be, and to reioyce for it, not with a worldly
and carnal ioy, as many do, but with a ſpirituall
and heauenly ioy of minde and conſcience,
as few doe. At the birth of our ſauiour,
there was a company and multitude of heauenly
ſouldiers prayſing God, and ſaying,
Glory be to God in the high heauens, and
peace in the earth, and towards men good
will, Luke 2. They reioyced in the Lord, &amp;
were thankful for it, &amp; yet are: much more
ought we to do the like, that his wil may be
done in earth of vs, as it is in heauen amongſt
them, euen as we dayly pray. Thy
wil be done in earth, as it is in heauen. We
haue in deede a celebration of this natiuitie
of Chriſt, which is miſcalled of vs Chriſtmas.
As ye name is euil, called Chriſtmas of
the Papiſts, as if Chriſt ſhould ſay Maſſe: ſo
is the time in it ſpent as lewdly of vs for the
moſt part, if not in maſſing, yet in maſking,
in carding and dicing, in dauncing, in bellie

cheere, in exceſſe of apparrell, and in fond
and fooliſhe playes &amp; ſportes, to paſſe the
time away. In theſe ſinnes and vanities,
is the tyme of Chriſtes natiuitie ſpent and
conſumed of vs. It were better to haue no
day of it, then ſo to keepe it: and it is a great
griefe to a godly mynde, to ſee that tyme
which ſhoulde be imployed to the ſeruice of
God, as it was in the primitiue Church, altogether
waſted and dedicated to offer ſacrifices
vnto the deuill: for it is in it, as it
is vpon the Sundayes or Lordes day thoroughout
the yeere. The Sabbath which is
appoynted for to heare Gods woorde, and
to pray in, is turned altogether to play in,
and made a day of all wicked ſport and paſtime,
which is far from the ryght vſe of it, &amp;
yet no Magiſtrate doeth correct it. God
giue an amendement one day of it, to his
honour and glory. Amen. Well, ſo it is
with this time of our Sauiours birth: we
ſhoulde giue thankes in it, and wee neuer
thinke of our duetie in it the moſt part of
vs. If Emperours and Kinges haue celebrated
the memoriall of their birth dayes,
then there is greater reaſon, why we ſhould
remember the ioyfulleſt birth day that euer
was, or ſhalbe, I meane, of Ieſus Chriſt

our ſauiour, borne ſo poorely and ſimply
for vs. Not that we ſhould ſo celebrate and
keepe Chriſts birth day, as wicked Herode
did celebrate his natiuitie, in feaſting, in
daunſing, in raſh ſwearing, and laſt of all, in
murdering the good ſaint of God, Iohn
Baptiſt, Matth. 14. Mark. 6. I ſay, we muſt
not ſo celebrate this birth day of Chriſt
with him, leaſt wee be partakers of his puniſhment
and payne. But yet I feare a
great many doe keepe this time no better.
Neither muſt we keepe this day of our brother
Chriſtes birth, as Titus kept the birth
day of his brother Domitian, in killing the
Iewes for his pleaſure, to triumphe, and
ſo defiled his handes with innocent blood,
ſurely we do not much better: for although
we kill not with the ſworde, yet we wound
and kill our brethren with our tongues, we
quarrel, we fight, and are contentious, wee
ſweare and blaſpheme, and ſo reuile the liuing
Lorde, and this is done moſt of all at
the birth day of our Sauiour, as alſo vpon
this day of reſt, the Sunday, with cardes
and dice &amp; bloody othes. Wel, the Lord one
day will take an account of theſe things of
vs, vnleſſe we ſpeedily repent and amende.
Thus we haue heard the thinges that may

be noted vpon Chriſtes birth, the circumſtances
of it, with the fruite that commeth
vnto vs by it, and howe wee ſhoulde vſe this
day, and what is our duetie in it. Let vs
thanke our ſauiour Chriſt, that he woulde
be thus borne for vs, and pray vnto him that
we may remember it, and haue the ende of
this his cōming in ye fleſh, the ſaluatiō of our
foules, which he graūt vnto vs: to whom wt
his father, and the holy ghoſt, be giuen all
prayſe and glory, for euer and euer: Amen.
               
               
                  The fourth Lecture vpō
the 4. article of our Chriſtian faith:
                  Suffered vnder Pontius Pilate, was crucified,
dead, and buried, deſcended into hell.
                  
                     WE haue ſeene in the other two articles
going before, the cōception
of Chriſt and his birth, and what
things were in them to be conſidered
of: now cōſequētly foloweth his death
with certayne circumſtances of it, as what
foloweth after it. But here may a queſtion
be aſked, why there is no mention made of
his life, which went betweene his birth and
death. To this it may be anſwered, that ſeeing

the benefites of his life be cōprehended
in his death (for whatſoeuer he did in al his
whole life, we inioy it in his paſſion) therefore
his life is not here ſet down, becauſe we
do beleeue it in his death. This article of
Chriſts death is very neceſſary; for nothing
had bene brought to paſſe for our ſaluation,
neither ſhould we haue had any profite at al
by Chriſt, vnleſſe he had bin crucified for vs.
Therefore it is not ſufficient to beleeue his
conception &amp; natiuitie, except we alſo confeſſe
with our mouthes, and beleeue in our
hearts ſtedfaſtly his death and bitter paſſion
for vs. Therfore Chriſt is alwayes to be cō
                     ſidered
of a Chriſtian man, as he was crucified
for his ſinnes. The meaning of this article
is this in other words: I yt am a chriſtian
man or woman, do beleeue &amp; confeſſe, yt
Chriſt my ſauiour ſuffered, whē Pilate was
deputy in Iurie, &amp; was condemned by him
moſt vniuſtly, and that he was crucified vpō
the croſſe or tree for my ſinnes, to redeeme
me, &amp; that he died for me, to bring me to life,
&amp; that he was buried and laide in the graue
as other men, &amp; ſuffered ye tormēts of hell in
body &amp; ſoule, to acquit me before ye iudgement
ſeat of God his father. In this article
are fiue things noted vnto vs. Firſt, vnder

whom he ſuffered, &amp; what iudge condemned
him: ſecondly, what maner of death he died,
he was crucified: thirdly, his death it ſelfe:
fourthly, what was done after, he was buried:
&amp; laſtly, what paines he ſuffered, he deſcended
into hel. Al theſe things are expreſſed
vnto vs in this one article: firſt is declared
vnto vs the name of him that condemned
Chriſt, which is Pilate a Romane, as
Iohn 19. And this his name is ſet downe,
not only for the credit of the hiſtorie to beleeue
it the better, but alſo becauſe this appertained
to the miſterie of our redemptiō,
that we might knowe his death to bee ioyned
with the condemnation of an earthly
iudge. For ſeeing that by ye death of Chriſt
not onely our ſinnes muſt bee purged, but
alſo the condemnation for them to be taken
away: it was neceſſary that hee ſhould
die by the ſentence of a iudge, and no otherwiſe,
that we might be abſolued before the
great iudge of all the worlde. If Chriſt
had been killed by theefes, or murdered in
a tumult or ſedition by priuate men, there
had bene no redemption for vs in ſuch a
death, no kinde of ſatiſfaction. But when
we reade in the Euangeliſtes in their Goſpell,
that he was arraigned at the barre, accuſed

by witneſſes, and condemned by the
ſentence of Pilate, (although iniuriouſlye,
hee pronouncing him iuſt, once or twiſe,
&amp; confeſſing that he found no fault in him)
we vnderſtand by thoſe thinges, that hee
ſuſtayned not the perſon of him ſelfe, but
of al vs moſt miſerable ſinners, that ſhould
haue bene ſo condemned before his father,
if he had not ſuffered this vnder Pontius
Pilate for vs. And here are two things
to be noted of vs, which are both confirmed
by the teſtimonies of the Prophets, and do
alſo giue a notable conſolation and confirmation
to our fayth: for when wee heare
that Chriſte was ſent to death, from the
iudgement ſeate, and was hanged betwene
the theeues, wee haue a full accompliſhment
of that propheſie, which is cited of
the Euāgeliſt, He was reckoned or counted
among the wicked, Eſay. 53. And why
was this ſo? truely, that he might ſuſtaine
the condition and eſtate of a ſinner, and not
of a iuſt man, as hee ſuffered death, not for
righteouſnes ſake, but for ſin and ye tranſgreſſions
of the wicked. Againe, when we
heare that he was pronounced innocent by
the ſame man, of whome he was condemned,
let vs remember that which another

Prophet ſpeaketh of him, I reſtored that
which I tooke not, Pſal. 69. yt is, Chriſt payed
for ſin, &amp; bought if full dearely, which he
neuer had, nor committed: for there was no
guile found in his mouth. And why did Pilate
then condemne him? Becauſe he feared
man more then God, &amp; Ceſars diſpleaſure
more then ye wrath of God: for when ye people
cryed, If thou let him goe, thou art not
Caeſars friend, then he conſented vnto them
to crucify him againſt his owne conſcience,
to pleaſure the people, &amp; to gratifye ye Emperour
Tiberius. So we ſee, that he was a
parcial, feareful, &amp; vniuſt iudge, &amp; had not
the properties of a good iudge, as is required,
Exod. 18. Firſt, that they ſhould be mē
of courage, ſecondly, fearing God, thirdly,
men dealing truely, fourthly, hating couetouſnes.
Let all Iudges take example &amp;
warning by Pilate, to execute iuſtice and
iudgement indifferently to all men. For
Pilate afterward, as hiſtories recorde, for
anguiſh and ſorowe of minde hanged himſelfe,
as Iudas did before him. And here
wee ſee, that as a Romane then condemned
Chriſt, and as alwayes afterwarde hee
was perſecuted by the Romaine Emperours:
ſo it is at this day by that great

Antichriſt of Rome, the Pope and his adherentes:
he is ſtill perſecuted in his members.
This is the iuſt iudgement of God
vpon them. God giue them grace (if it bee
his will) to repent, &amp; to come to the knowledge
of the trueth, Amen. Secondly, let
vs conſider the maner of his death what it
was. It was the croſſe, moſt ſhamefull and
accurſed, not onely in mans ſight, but alſo
of God him ſelfe. Deut. 21. The curſe of
God is on him that is hanged. This Paul
repeateth, Gala. 3. and ſaith, Chriſt hath
redeemed vs from the curſe of the lawe,
being made a curſe for vs, for it is written:
Curſed is euery one that hangeth on tree.
Thus we ſee ſtill in euery article, and in
euery point of our ſaluation, that exceeding
great loue of Chriſt our maſter to vs,
that not onely he was contented to ſuffer
moſt grieous paine for vs, but alſo ſhame
and reproche, ignominie and contempt of
the worlde. He was at the firſt taking, led
away to Annas and Caiaphas, and then
poſted ouer to Pilate. Pilate ſent him to
Herode, and Herode ſent him back againe
with mockes and tauntes in a purple robe
in mockage, &amp; deriſion of him. And all this
did our ſauiour Chriſt for vs. This was

much that I haue rehearſed already, but
yet nothing to ye death of the croſſe: for the
croſſe was as odious &amp; ſhameful to them, as
the gallowes is to vs, &amp; yet Chriſt was wel
contented with it, ſo wee might bee redeemed.
This is that Paul ſpeaketh of to the
Heb. 12. willing vs to follow the great humilitie
of Chriſt in his ſuffering of ſhame,
ſaith, Let vs alſo, ſeeing that we are compaſſed
with ſo great a cloude of witneſſes,
caſt away euery thing that preſſeth down,
and ſinne that hangeth ſo faſt on: let vs
runne with patience, the race that is ſet
before vs, looking vnto Ieſus the author &amp;
finiſher of our faith, who for the ioy that
was ſet before him, endured the croſſe, &amp;
deſpiſed the ſhame, and is ſet at the right
hand of the throne of God. Conſider
therfore him that endured ſuch ſpeaking
agaīſt of ſinners, leſt ye ſhould be wearied
and faint in your mindes. We ſee many
men can abide to ſuffer paine and griefe,
which yet notwithſtanding are ouercome
with ſhame and reproche, and can hardly
abide it. One peraduenture could bee contented
to ſuffer ſome trouble for his deare
friende, but who will bee hanged for his
friende? Let the ſame minde therefore

dearely beloued be in you, that was euen
in Chriſt Ieſus, who being in the forme
of God, thought it no robberie to be equal
with God, but hee made himſelfe of
no reputation, and tooke on him the ſhape
of a ſeruant, and was made like vnto men,
and was found in ſhape as a man: he humbled
himſelfe, and became obedient vnto
the death, euen the death of the croſſe.
You ſee out of this place, howe Chriſt for
our ſakes abaſed himſelfe to ſhame, which
conſiſteth in foure poyntes. It was much
for him being God, to become man, whether
it had bene King, or Prince, or Lorde:
but it was more to become a miſerable
man, a ſeruant vnto men: more then that,
it was to die: but moſt of all was it worthy
prayſe and commendation, that he died the
death of the croſſe, not for his friendes, but
for his foes. Many other thinges did our
ſauiour ſuffer of the people, ye Scribes, the
Phariſes, &amp; the Iewes: as reuilings, &amp; blaſphemies,
bitter nippes, and tauntes, but al
was nothing to this croſſe, it ſurmounteth
all: &amp; yet for all this, we muſt not be aſhamed
of him, for hee is our glory, Galat. 6.
1. Corinth. 2. they that are aſhamed of him
here in earth before men, he wil be aſhamed

of thē in heauē before his father &amp; his Angels.
Let vs therfore confeſſe and acknowledge
Chriſt crucified for vs, and let vs neuer
be aſhamed of him, when hee commeth
with his croſſe, for he that taketh not vp his
croſſe dayly &amp; followeth him, is not worthy
to be his diſciple, Luke 9. He might rather
haue bene aſhamed of vs, to ſee vs in that
caſe we were, worſer then wee can ſee any
poore miſerable begger, amongſt vs here
in earth. We ſee then, yt by Chriſt crucified,
the bleſſing of Abraham is come vpon vs yt
were Gentiles, Galat. 3. and ye the ſerpents
head is broken, he being y• true ſerpēt lifted
vp vpon ye croſſe, to ſaue al thoſe that hope
vpon him by fayth, as the other braſen ſerpent
lyfted vp by Moſes in the wildernes,
ſaued all thoſe Iſraelites ye were ſtong, &amp;
looked vp vnto it, Numb. 21. verſe. 9. Furthermore,
by this croſſe, ye hande writing of
ordinances which was againſt vs, &amp; which
was cōtrary to vs, he, euē he tooke it out of
ye way, &amp; faſtened it vpon the croſſe, &amp; hath
ſpoyled ye principalities, &amp; powers, &amp; hath
made a ſhew of thē opēly, &amp; hath triūphed ouer
thē in ye ſame croſſe, Col. 2. Of this crucifying,
&amp; lifting vp vpō ye croſſe, was Iſaac
a figure, who was boūd &amp; laid vpō ye altar,

ready to be offered. And ſo were al the ſinne
offerings layde vpon the altar: for he was
made of God his father ſinne for vs, that
wee might he made the righteouſnes of
God in him, which knewe no ſinne, 2. Corinth.
5. But of all other types and ſhadowes
of the ceremonial lawe, this taking
away of ſinne by Chriſt in his croſſe, was
moſt liuely ſet forth and repreſented vnto
vs, as in a glaſſe, in the ſcaps goate. For the
Lord commanded Aaron Leuit. 16. that
he ſhould take a liue hee goate, and preſent
him quicke before the Lorde, to make reconciliation
by him, and that he ſhould put
his handes vpon the head of the goate, and
confeſſe ouer him all the iniquities of the
children of Iſrael, and all their treſpaſſes, &amp;
all their ſinnes, putting them vpon the
head of the goate, &amp; ſhould ſend him away,
by the hande of a man appointed, into the
wildernes: ſo the goate ſhall beare vpon
him all their iniquities into the lande that
is not inhabited. Here was our ſauiour
Chriſt figured, which bare in his body vpō
the croſſe, the iniquities of vs al, Eſai. 53.
1. Pet. 2. and was wounded for our tranſgreſſions,
and caried away al our ſorowes,
for by his ſtripes are wee healed. Eſay. 53.

Furthermore, this betraying and crucifying
of Chriſt, and ſelling of him for thirty
pence, was alſo forefigured in Ioſeph.
For as Ioſeph was ſolde of his owne brethren
into the handes of ſtrangers: ſo was
Chriſt betrayed and ſold of his owne diſciple,
anddeliuered of his owne nation into
the handes of Pilate and the Heathen. The
third thing that followeth in this article, is
his death. He was dead in deede, as the Euangeliſtes
doe report: for Luke ſayth of
him, that he cryed with a loude voyce and
ſayde, Father, into thy hands I commend
my ſpirit. And when he had thus ſayd, he
gaue vp the ghoſt, Luk 23. So for the certaintie
of it, it is not onely ſaid that he was
crucified, but alſo that he died: for otherwiſe
nothing had bene wrought for vs.
God ſayde to Adam, In what day ſoeuer
thou ſhalt eate of the forbidden tree of
knowledge of good and euill, thou ſhalt
die the death. Adam offended and brake
this commandement: hee was not able to
make ſatiſfaction for it, to die the death of
body and ſoule: therfore the ſecond Adam
Ieſus Chriſt died the death of body, &amp; ſuffered
the death in ſoule, to redeeme vs, and
to ſatiſfie Gods wrath &amp; diſpleaſure, conceiued

moſt iuſtly againſt our ſinne in
Adam. This death was ſignified in euery
ſacrifice of beaſtes in the olde lawe of Moſes,
in the killing of bullockes, of calues,
of ſheepe, of goates, and ſuch other things.
For as the Apoſtle ſayth, without ſhedding
of blood was no remiſſion of ſinnes.
This was verified in Chriſtes blood, ſhed
for vs in his death. Neither was this death
of Chriſt to be ſeene onely ſhadowed in the
ceremonies of the Leuiticall lawe, but alſo
in diuers men. As Samſon, who died him
ſelfe to deliuer his people from the Philiſtims:
ſo Chriſt, to deliuer vs from the
deuils, died him ſelfe. Dauid alſo was
a figure of him in many thinges. Here we
ſee then, what a grieuous thing ſinne was
in Gods ſight, that he could be pacified by
no other meanes, then by the blood &amp; death
of his only and welbeloued Sonne Ieſus.
Surely our ſinnes were as hard as the Adamant
ſtone, which could not be brokē by
any other meanes, then by the blood of the
true goate Ieſus Chriſt. Conſider here the
wonderfull &amp; vnſpeakeable loue of Chriſt:
he would die for vs, yt we might eſcape: euē
as ye Pelicane, which hauing brought forth

her young ones dead, or being ſtong &amp; killed
by ſerpētes, ſhe pecketh forth her heart
blood to reuiue her young ones: ſo we, heing
conceiued and borne in ſinne, and altogether
dead in our treſpaſſes and offences,
Epheſ. 2. ſtong of that old and fiery ſerpent
the diuell, which firſt beguiled our parents
in paradiſe, and ſo hauing the rewarde of
ſinne which is death: we (I ſay) in this caſe
are reuiued and quickened againe, by the
blood of that true Pelicane Ieſus Chriſt,
which hee from his heart hath ſhead and
powred out for vs. Thus we ſee how deeply
we are indebted to Chriſt for his great
loue to vs, in dying for our ſinnes, and yet
how fewe remember this death! Many, not
once in a day, nay, not once in a weeke, or
moneth, I feare, ſome, not once in a whole
yeere doe remember it well: they are the
more vnthākeful, &amp; vnkind ſonnes to God
ſo good a father, &amp; Chriſt ſo louing a brother.
It is ye only thing yt ſhould eſpecially
be remēbred, although all other things be
forgottē. Beleeue me (deare brethrē) Chriſt
died not to this ende, yt his death ſhould be
forgotten, which was ſo cruell to him, or yt
it ſhould be lightly remēbred of vs, for yt he
might haue vs to remēber it ye better, he inſtituted

his laſt ſupper, in bread &amp; wine: the
bread brokē, to put vs in minde of his moſt
pure &amp; pretious body broken &amp; bruiſed for
our ſinnes, &amp; that it doeth nouriſh vs, as the
bread doth nouriſh our bodies: for his fleſh
is meat in deede Iohn 6. The wine ordeined,
to put vs in mind of his blood powred
out for vs, to waſh vs from al our ſinnes,
1. Iohn 1. &amp; that as ye wine doth quench our
thirſt, and refreſh vs, &amp; comfort our hearts
being ſoroweful: ſo doeth ye blood of Chriſt
al theſe things vnto vs, in greater meaſure
and abundance. This doeth alſo teache vs
vnitie &amp; loue together, yt as many grapes
make but one wine, and many graynes of
corne &amp; wheate make but one lofe of bread:
ſo ſhould we be but one in Chriſt our head,
for we are all members of the ſame body.
The other ſacramēt alſo of Baptiſme, doth
put vs in minde of Chriſtes death: for as ye
water in baptiſme doth waſh the body: ſo
doeth the blood of Chriſt waſh our ſoules,
and clenſe them frō their filthines. Which
thing is repreſented vnto vs in our baptiſme,
a ſigne of our newe birth and regeneration
by the ſpirite of Chriſt. Therefore
in our baptiſme we ought to remember
this death, for wee are buried with him

into his death, by this ſeale and ſacrament
of our baptiſme, as Paul proueth, Rom. 6.
Nowe we ſee, that to the ende we may remember
this great benefite of Chriſtes
death, we haue tokens of it, two in number:
the ſupper of Chriſt, and baptiſme: for
by thē we ſhew forth the Lords death, vntil
he come againe to iudgemēt, 1. Cor. 11.
Nowe if any man marueile why we dye,
ſince Chriſt hath died for vs, &amp; taſted death
once for all men, to make reconciliatiō for
the ſinnes of the people, &amp; to ſatiſfie Gods
iuſtice: he may be anſwered, yt Chriſt hath
taken away the ſecond death of the ſoule, &amp;
not this firſt &amp; naturall death of the body,
which is common to all, for by it we enter
into life: and although it be ſometime grieuous
to Gods children, yet it is not deadly
to them, nay rather, ioyfull, ſeeing by it
they come to Chriſt their head, as it was
to Paul: I deſire, ſaith he, to be looſed, and
to be with Chriſt, meaning, to die. For albeit
this death of the body dwelleth in vs,
yet it hath no dominion ouer vs, by the
force and efficacie of Chriſtes death. And
wee knowe that it is made nowe to the
elect, a gate to paſſe by into heauen. We
ſhould not then feare death, ſeeing that

the loſſe of this tranſitory life, is the high
way into Gods euerlaſting kingdome.
And this may bee anſwered concerning
ſinne alſo. If any man aſke, howe it commeth
to paſſe, that wee haue ſinne ſtill remaining
in vs, ſeeing Chriſt hath died for
it to take it away: I anſwere, that Chriſt
hath taken awaye the condemnation of
ſinne, that it ſhall not hurt vs, to bring vs
to deſtruction, but the full aboliſhing of
ſinne ſhall ceaſe in the latter day of iudgement,
when all thinges ſhall bee reſtored
againe to their perfection, Actes 5. So
that now we may ſay, There is no condemnation
of ſinne to them that are in Chriſt
Ieſus, which walke not after the fleſh, but
after the ſpirite, Rom. 8. For ſee the wonderfull
working of God, that all the curſes
and paynes that were in Ieſus Chriſt, are
turned to our bleſſings and ioyes: his death
is our life, his pouerty our riches, his ſhame
our glory, his deſcenſion into hell, is made
our aſcenſion into heauen: and finally, his
miſery here in this life, is made our felicitie
and happineſſe in the life to come. This is
the Lordes doing, and it is marueilous in
our eyes. O that men would therefore
prayſe the Lorde for his goodnes, and declare

the wonders that hee doeth for the
children of men! This death of Chriſte
hath two benefites in it: for firſt it cauſeth
that wee ſhall not die in the life to come,
and then here it mortifieth our earthly
members, it killeth our olde man Adam
within vs, that it bringeth not foorth his
accuſtomed actions of ſinne within vs.
Thus much concerning his death. Let vs
nowe conſider briefly the fourth poynt in
this article, which is his buriall. Chriſte
was buried by an honourable Counſeller,
Ioſeph of Arimathea, and Nicodemus,
a ruler of the Iewes, who begged his body
boldly of Pilate, and buried it with odours,
as the maner was, Iohn 19. His
buriall is mentioned, to aſſure vs that hee
died in deede, as when wee ſee a man buried,
wee doubt not but that hee is dead.
The leſſon that we learne by this buriall of
Chriſt, is this, as the Apoſtle Paul teacheth
vs, Rom. 6. and Coloſ. 2. that we ſhould
ſo through baptiſme bee freed and buried
from ſinne, as he was buried in the graue,
that like as Chriſte was rayſed vp from
the dead to ye glorie of his father: ſo we alſo
ſhould walke in newenes of life. So then,
as we are crucified with Chriſt vnto ſinne,

and dead and buried thereto, ſo muſt wee
riſe againe with him vnto righteouſnes.
But of this, more (God willing) in yt article
of his reſurrection. The laſt thing to be
noted in this death of Chriſt, is the paynes
which he ſuffered, which is called his deſcenſion
into hell. Although this bee laſt in
wordes, yet in ſenſe it is to be ioyned with
his crucifying, and went before his death in
body, and buriall in the ſepulchre. The
meaning therefore of this his deſcenſion, is
this: that Chriſt our ſauiour, to redeeme
vs both in body and ſoule, which had offended
God, ſuffered the tormentes of hell, the
wrath infinite of his father for the time, not
onely in body, but alſo in ſoule, and did abide
the moſt bitter and vnſpeakeable ſorowes
of death in his minde and conſciēce,
preſſed downe with the burden of all our
ſinnes, as if hee had bene forſaken of God
his father. In this hell and torment, partly
he was in his heauy agony in the garden,
when he ſwette (as it were) teares of
blood trickling downe from his face: his
ſoule was verie heauie and ſorowfull, euen
vnto the death, ſo that there came an angel
and comforted him from heauen, Luke 22.
This hell was ſo great vnto him, that he

prayed his Father, if it were poſſible, that
the cuppe of his paſſion myght paſſe from
him: Yea, which was moſt of all, he was
compelled for the very anguiſh and griefe
of heart and ſoule,Pſal. 22. 1. to ſay and cry out: O my
God,
                     Matt. 27. 46. 
                     my God, why haſt thou forſaken
me? So that all the things that Chriſt ſuffered
before, were nothing to this, yt now he
ſuffered, whē he cryed out for very payne, &amp;
extreme ſorowe of minde. For we muſt remēber,
that Chriſt vpon ye croſſe, did not only
ſuffer paines in body, (as they did which
were crucified wt him, which were ye paines
that ye Iewes did put him to) but farther, he
ſuffered ye extreme wrath of God his father,
hanging vpon him, heauier then heauen and
earth, which no angel was able to endure: &amp;
therfore, that he might be able to endure and
to cōquer it, it was neceſſarie, that he ſhould
be God alſo, as well as man. For he ſuffred
for all the ſinnes, originall, and actuall, in
thought, worde and deede, of all men that
euer were or are, or ſhall be from the beginning
of the worlde, from Adam vntill the
ende of it, I ſay, he hath ſuffred ſufficiently
for them all, and as great paynes and torments
as any damned ſoules in hell can or
ſhall ſuffer. And was not this an hell (trowe

you) vnto our Sauiour, to abide in his bodie
and ſoule, all theſe torments, which can
not be vttered with any eloquēce or tongue
of man? Nothing had bene done for vs, if
Chriſt had dyed the common death of the
body onely, as other dyd. It was neceſſarie
therefore and very expedient, that we might
be perfectly redeemed in both partes both
body and ſoule, that hee ſhoule feele the
ſeuere puniſhment of the vengeāce of God,
becauſe he powred out his ſoule an offering
for ſinne, and tooke vpon him our part,
which were the malefactors and offendors,
to bring vs vnto the fauour of God againe.
We muſt not thinke then, (yea God forbid
we ſhoulde) that he ſuffered no more payne
then the Iewes put him to, or the other two
dyd which hanged with him. For we ſee
they cryed not out as Chriſt dyd, for they
felt not ſo much as he did, which ſuffred for
the whole worlde. And all this was for our
cauſe: Let vs then applie it as a medicine
to our wounds, otherwiſe it will not heale
vs. Take the ſhielde of fayth, that when
yee are in great torment and griefe for
your ſinnes, (as Satan doeth many times
obiect them vnto you) when yee are euen
at the brinke of deſperation, then this will

be a notable comfort vnto you, to beare off
all aſſaultes and grieuous tentations, yea,
to quench the fiery dartes of the deuil, to remember,
that our Sauiour Chriſt ſuffered
the torments of hel euery one of them, to deliuer
you from thē. This one leſſon, if it be
well learned, &amp; ſurely ſetled in our hearts,
will heale a wounded conſcience, will rayſe
vs vp from the gates of hel, and will in our
greateſt diſtreſſe, be very ſweet vnto vs. Be
our ſinnes neuer ſo many, either as ye ſands
of the ſea, or as the ſtarres of heauen, as they
can not be ſo many: yet Chriſts mercy is aboue
thē all, &amp; greater thē they, &amp; hath paide
a ſufficient price and ranſome for them all.
If they were as redde as purple or as crimſon:
yet they ſhalbe made as white as wool,
and like to ſnowe, Eſay. 1. A notable &amp; cō
                     fortable
place: for before, ye Prophet ſharply
rebuked them of their grieuous ſinnes
and offences, and nowe in theſe words promiſeth
them mercy, if they will repent and
amende, and ſo turne to the Lord with their
whole heart. In this, that Chriſt hath ſuffered
the tormentes of hell for all, we gather,
that all that are ſaued, are ſaued by Chriſt
alone, from Adam vntill this time, and to
the ende of all the world: for he is the lambe

ſlayne from the beginning of the worlde,
Reuel. 13. That is to ſay, his death and
paſſion was as effectuall to redeeme al that
were before him, that dyd beleeue in him
that he ſhoulde come, as it was auayleable
afterwarde to ſaue all that are after him,
which do beleeue that he is come in the fleſh
already to ſaue them. This is that, that our
Sauiour meant, when he ſayde,Iohn 8. 56. that Abraham
reioyced to ſee his dayes, and ſawe
them: that is, reioyced in Chriſt, that he
ſhoulde be his Sauiour.Actes 4. 12. 
                     For none other is
there giuen vnder heauen wherin we muſt
be ſaued, Actes. 4. Thus wee ſee what is
meant by theſe words, deſcended into hell:
howe he ſuffered helliſh tormentes for vs,
not that his ſoule went into hell after his
death, for it was in paradiſe, in the hands of
God, as he commended it to his Father, &amp;
as ye ſoules of the bleſſed are, &amp; his body was
in the graue. Neither is there any place of
ſcripture to proue any other diſcenſion thē
this, which is ful of trueth &amp; comfort. They
alledge y• place of Dauid, Pſal. 16. 10. But
that doth proue vnto vs his reſurrectiō that
his body ſhoulde not be left in the graue, as
others were, to ſee corruption and to rotte,
as Peter doeth apply it, Act, 2. 27. to proue

his reſurrection from death, and not his deſcenſion
into hell. The place of 1. Peter. 3.
doeth ſhewe, that the Spirite of Chriſt was
in the dayes of Noe, and preached by him
to the wicked which were then rebellious
and diſobedient, and are nowe damned
ſoules in hell, which he tearmeth ſpirites in
pryſon. This is the meaning of Peter in
that place, (as alſo good interpreters doe
prooue.) Neyther did Chriſt deſcende into
hell to fetch the godly Patriarkes from
thence, which dyed in his faith before his
comming in the fleſh, for they were in heauen
already as concerning the ſoule, for the
ſoules of the righteous are in the hands of
God, and no torment ſhall touch them,
Wiſd. 3. Here then ſeeing Chriſt hath ſuffered
and fulfilled all things for vs, we may
ſaye to God as concerning his iuſtice, O
righteous God, if ſhame, confuſion and
ignominie bee due to ſinners for their euill
deſertes, if death bee the ſtipende and reward
of ſinne, Rom. 6. 23. If it deſerue thy
wrath and indignation moſt ſeuere, If it be
worthy to be puniſhed not onely with moſt
ſharpe paynes of body, but alſo extreeme
torments of mynd and conſcience: briefely,
if it deſerue hell and damnation for the vileneſſe

and filthineſſe of it: Then O moſt iuſt
Father and God, Chriſt thy Sonne hath
ſuffered all theſe thinges to the vtmoſt, hee
hath paide al whatſoeuer thou canſt require
of mee, for ſinne,Col. 2. 14. he hath perfourmed thy
bande and obligation, and hath clearely canceled
the handwriting that was againſt me.
For can there bee a greater burden with
meaſure more heaped and full, and preſſed
downe, appoynted for ſinne and iniquitie,
then this was, which Chriſt Ieſus thy beloued
&amp; only Sonne, which was in thy boſome,
hath borne already for me? Therefore
I beſeeche thee moſt deare and tender Father,
whenſoeuer my ſinnes ſhall come into
thy ſight, or queſtion with thee, which my
aduerſarie the deuill layeth before thee and
me, that then thou wouldeſt looke vpon
Chriſt thy Sonne, which is thy true looking
glaſſe, in whom thou ſhalt finde me to
be moſt pure and innocent, and to be of the
ſame white colour with him, and to ſhine
moſt bryght in his righteouſneſſe, which he
giueth vnto me by faith, if I beleeue in him,
as I can perſwade my ſelfe moſt certainely
and vnfaynedly that I doe. Good Father,
for his ſake receiue me into mercie, and beſtowe
thy heauenly bleſſings vpon me, becauſe

hee hath deſerued them well at thy
handes. This prayer with boldneſſe and
confidence in Chriſtes blood, may a true
Chriſtian man make to God the Father,
when his ſinnes ſhall begin to accuſe him:
and herein may he finde comfort, otherwiſe
none at all. For God is not pleaſed, but in
Chriſt and in his doings, as he ſaith, This
is my welbeloued Sonne, heare him, Matt.
3. and 17. Where we note, that Chriſt is
our onely reconciler to God, and our onely
ſcholemaſter to teach vs the trueth of Gods
worde. Thus haue we heard in this article,
the death of Chriſt, a wonderfull and vnſpeakable
myſterie, the circumſtances of it,
the cauſe of the ſame, the paines he ſuffered,
and what comfort we haue and enioy by it.
Nowe let vs giue to our heauenly Father
moſt heartie, earneſt, and continuall
thankes for it, and likewiſe to Ieſus
Chriſt, that woulde vouchſafe to take it vpon
him for our ſakes, ſuch poore and miſerable
wretches as wee were. It is the
greateſt and moſt precious Iewel and Diamonde
that God coulde beſtowe vpon vs.
Let vs therefore pray vnto him, to make vs
deepely conſider of the valewe of it in our
hearts and mindes, that we ſlightly eſteeme

not of ſo excellent a treaſure, but that wee
may ſell all, and buy it. Let vs furthermore
deſire of him, that by the death of his
Sonne, hee woulde kill in vs all carnall
and worldly luſtes, and mortifie our earthly
members, pride, concupiſcence, ambition,
hatred, couetouſneſſe and ſuch lyke
ſinnes, that wee walke in them no more.
Nowe ſeeing Chriſt hath dyed for them, to
put them all away, and hath faſtned and
nayled them to his Croſſe, that we ſhoulde
ſerue him (being deliuered from the handes
of our enemies) without feare, all the
dayes of our life, in holineſſe and true righteouſneſſe
before him: This God graunt
vnto vs for Chriſts ſake, to whome with the
holy Ghoſt, one bleſſed God, be rendred all
prayſe, and glory, and thankes giuing for
euer, and euer, Amen.
               
               
                  
                  The fifth Lecture vpon
the fifth article:
                  The third day he roſe againe from the dead.
                  
                     WE haue ſeene before three articles,
concerning the perſon of our ſauiour
Chriſt, as his conception, his
birth, his death: which we haue expounded as
God hath giuē vs ability by his grace. Now
foloweth the fift article concerning his reſurrection
from the dead. And this doth folowe
orderly in the beliefe after his death &amp;
paſſion: for ſo did Chriſt alwaies ioyne theſe
two together, his death and riſing againe,
ſaying to his diſciples, Mat. 26. 21. Behold,
we goe vp to Ieruſalem, and the ſonne of
mā ſhalbe deliuered vnto the chiefe prieſts
and ſcribes, and they ſhall condemne him
to death, &amp; ſhal deliuer him to the Gētiles,
to mocke &amp; to ſcourge &amp; to crucifie, but
ye third day he ſhal riſe again. This was ſpoken
to comfort them, yt although they cōceyued
great care &amp; ſorow, in hearīg yt he ſhould
be killed, yet they might take as great comfort
againe to heare, that hee was riſen from
the dead. Chriſtes enemies did in deede what
they might and coulde, to keep him downe
ſtill: they layd a great ſtone and heauie vpon
his graue, they ſealed ye ſtone, they made

the ſepulchre ſure wt a watch of ſouldiers,
Matth. 27. 66. But all was in vayne: for
Chriſt muſt needes be true of his worde and
promiſe, to ariſe againe the third day, as he
had often foretolde and prophecied of to his
Apoſtles, and of the which they were al witneſſes,
and as S. Paul ſaith, moe then fiue
hūdred brethrē at once did ſee him. If any
require teſtimonies of his reſurrection out
of ſcripture, let him read the 28. of Matth.
the 16 of Mar. the 24. of Luke, the 20. &amp; 21.
of Iohn, the 1. Cor. 15. with many other
places of ſcripture. Wherefore no man can
doubt of the trueth of this article, being confirmed
by ſo many places of ye word of God.
This reſurrectiō was very neceſſary: for vnleſſe
it had folowed, and Chriſt riſen again,
nothing had bene wrought concerning our
ſaluation, neither had death bene conquered,
nor ſatā deſtroied, nor we redeemed perfectly
from the dolours of death. Therefore S.
Peter ſaith, that God hath raiſed him vp, &amp;
looſed the ſorowes of death, becauſe it was
vnpoſſible that he ſhoulde be holden of it,
Acts 2. 24. as Dauid alſo proueth, Pſa. 16.
Thou ſhalt not leaue my ſoule in ye graue,
neither ſhalt thou ſuffer thy holy one to ſee
corruption. This article doth proue vnto

vs, that Chriſt is both man and God:man, in
that he did riſe with his body in the which he
fell and died before, for it is vnproper to ſay
that God doth riſe againe, for he doth neuer
fall. His reſurrection doth proue him to be
God alſo, becauſe he rayſed vp himſelfe the
third day, as he teſtifieth, Deſtroy this temple
(meaning of his body) and in three daies
I wil reare it vp agayne, Ioh. 2. 20. It is alſo
ſaide, that he was rayſed vp by the glorie
of his father, but that is ſpokē as concerning
his humanity, wherin he is inferior to his father.
Seeing then yt in the croſſe, death &amp; buriall
of Chriſt, doth appeare a kinde of infirmitie
and weakenes in reſpect of the world,
becauſe theſe things in Chriſt ſeeme baſe to
many: wee haue to goe further for the full
ſtrengthening of our faith, to his moſt glorious
&amp; victorious reſurrection ouer al his
enemies: for although we haue a ful accompliſhment
of our ſaluation in his death, becauſe
that by it wee are reconciled to God,
and ſatiſfactiō is made to his iuſtice for our
ſinnes, ſo that ye curſe is taken away frō vs,
&amp; the puniſhmēt paid for our offēces: yet for
al this, we are ſaid to be begottē
                      (not by his
death, but by his reſurrection) into a liuely
hope: for theſe are ye words of Saint Peter,

1. Epiſt. 1. Chap. Bleſſed be God, euen the
father of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, which according
to his abūdant mercy hath begotten
vs againe vnto a liuely hope, by the reſurrection
of Ieſus Chriſt frō the dead, to an
inheritance immortall &amp; vndefiled, &amp; that
withereth not, reſerued in heauen for vs,
which are kept by the power of God thorow
faith vnto ſaluation, which is prepared
to be ſhewed in ye laſt time, (meaning whē
Chriſt ſhal come to iudgement) and we ſhal
riſe in our bodies. Wherefore as Chriſt by
riſing ſo triumphātly, became cōquerour of
death: ſo the victory of our faith doeth conſiſt
eſpecially in his reſurrection, euē as the
holy Apoſtle doth plainly expreſſe it, Rom.
4. 25. for he ſaith, that Chriſt was deliuered
from our ſinnes, but is riſen againe for our
iuſtificatiō: as if he ſhould ſay, By his death
was ſinne takē away &amp; aboliſhed, but iuſtice
and righteouſneſſe was reſtored &amp; renewed
vnto vs by his reſurrection from death.
For otherwiſe, how could he haue deliuered
vs from death by dying, if he himſelf had bin
ſwallowed vp of death? or howe ſhould he
haue gotten vs the victorie, yt had loſt it himſelf?
This thing the Prophete Oſee foreſeeing
by the ſpirite of God, ſpake prophetically

as Dauid and other Prophets did, of
this reſurrection of our ſauiour, ſaying, O
death, I wil be thy death, O graue, I wil be
thy deſtruction, Oſee, Chap. 13. verſe. 14.
Wherfore we do in this ſort diſtinguiſh ye benefites
of his death from the benefites of his
reſurrectiō. By his death ſinne is aboliſhed:
by his reſurrectiō righteouſnes is reſtored:
by his death is death extinguiſhed: by his reſurrection
is life repayred: to conclude, by ye
one, hel gates are brokē vp &amp; vāquiſhed, &amp; by
ye other, ye dores of heauē are vnſhut &amp; opened
vnto vs. Theſe are the proper differences betweene
his death &amp; reſurrection, although ye
one ſometime is takē for ye other, &amp; al things
are giuen and applied to his death whatſoeuer
we inioy. Here may be a queſtion, why
Chriſt was three dayes in the ſepulchre.
Firſt I may ſay, It was to fulfill the ſcriptures:
for Ionas was a figure &amp; ſigne of his
reſurrection: now as Ionas was three daies
and three nightes in the fiſhes belly, ſo was
Chriſt in the graue. Agayne, hee was there
three dayes, and did not riſe by &amp; by immediatly
after his death, to confirme ye certaintie
of his death, that he was dead in deede: for if
he ſhould haue riſen ſtraight way, mē might
haue thought with thēſelues that he had not

bin throughly dead. Againe, although it be
ſaid that he was three dayes and three nights
in the heart of the earth, yet was he there but
part of thē: for the ſcripture doth take a part
&amp; halfe of a day for a whole day, as alſo part
of a mā, for ye whole mā. Wheras it is ſaide,
there were ſo many ſoules in the ſhip with
Paul,
                     Actes 27. 37. it is meant, ſo many men in al with bodies
&amp; ſoules: but the better, greater, &amp; excellenter
part is vſually taken for the whole, as
in this place of three daies. This article hath
two principall poynts to be conſidered in it:
firſt, the reſurrectiō it ſelf of Chriſt, ſecondly,
the benefites yt come vnto vs by it, which
are three in nūber. Firſt, life &amp; righteouſnes
is reſtored vnto vs by his riſing: thē mortification
&amp; newnes of life here amōg men, is
taught vnto vs by this reſurrection: laſtly,
we are aſſured &amp; perſwaded of our reſurrectiō.
In that yt Chriſt our head is riſen again,
we alſo the members ſhall riſe with him, as
Paul ſaith, Whēſoeuer Chriſt which is our
head ſhal appeare, thē ſhal we alſo appeare,
that is, riſe with him in glorie, (yt is) a glorified
body as his is. Phil. 3. Coloſ. 3. This
can not be but great comfort vnto vs. As cō
                     cerning
his reſurrection, partly ſome thing
was alledged before, &amp; teſtimonies brought

to confirme it, but this may be ſaide more of
it, that it is ſo neceſſarie to be beleeued vnto
ſaluation, that without it no life can be had:
for how can he haue life, that doth not, or wil
not beleeue the author &amp; giuer of life, Ieſus
Chriſt, to be aliue &amp; riſen, but dead? how (I
ſay) cā ſuch an one haue any life in him at al?
Therefore our Sauiour, willing to leaue a
perpetuall memorie of this article to his
Church, ſeeing it was of ſuch great waight
&amp; importance, after that he had ſuffered, preſented
him ſelfe aliue to his Apoſtles &amp; diſciples,
&amp; to the women alſo, by many infallible
tokens, being ſeene of them by ye ſpace
of fourtie dayes, &amp; ſpeaking of thoſe things
which appertayne to the kingdome of God.
To this ende, yt he might cōfirme &amp; ſtrengthen
thē in this true reſurrection, he did eate
&amp; drinke wt them after he roſe, Acts. 10. ſhewed
thē his hands &amp; his feete, bid them handle
him, &amp; ſee that it was euen he and none other,
Luk. 24. 39. Yea this point is ſo neceſſarie
to obteyne euerlaſting ſaluation, that
the Apoſtle S. Paul doth affirme, that if
Chriſt be not riſen againe, then is our preaching
in vayne, then is our faith in vayne,
then are we falſe witneſſes of God, thē are
we yet in our ſinnes, and they that are fallē
                     
                     
aſleepe in Chriſt are periſhed, and we of al
men are moſt miſerable. All theſe abſurdities
and inconueniences do follow, if we or
any other beleeue not ſtedfaſtly, that Chriſt
is riſen againe. But (dearly beloued) Chriſt
is riſen againe, as the Angel ſaid to the women,Matth. 28. 6.
                     He is riſen, he is not here, when they
thought hee had not bene riſen, but there in
the graue as hee was layde. The Phariſees
thought, that if they could perſwade the people
from the beliefe of this his reſurrection,
they ſhould do well ynough with them, and
therfore they gaue large money to the ſouldiers,
to ſay that he was ſtollen away by his
diſciples by night. They wel knew that if ye
people of the Iewes did beleeue this his ryſing
frō the dead, they would eaſely beleeue
all other myſteries of his death and paſſion,
with the articles going before. The
Euangeliſts al of them do inculcate &amp; make
mentiō of no one article ſo much as of this:
for although Iohn and Marke doe make no
mention of his byrth &amp; conception, yet notwithſtanding,
they make diligent rehearſall
of this reſurrection in their Goſpels, Marke
16. Ioh. 21. The Apoſtles after ye aſcenſion
of Chriſt, did eſpecially preach this article to
ye people in al ſermōs &amp; preachīgs of theirs.

Peter in fiue Sermons together, the 1. 2.
3. 4. 5. of the Actes of the Apoſtles, maketh
eſpeciall mention of this reſurrection. So
doth he in the Actes 10. And ſo doth Paul.
Act. 13. and 17. and in euery Epiſtle of his.
For in deede our whole faith dependeth vpon
it, which if it be once ouerthrowen, then
can not our faith be ſure &amp; ſtable. Although
the Apoſtles were choſen to be witneſſes of
all the doings and actiōs of Chriſt, Act. 10.
verſe. 39. yet were they eſpeciall witneſſes
of his reſurrection, becauſe it ſeemed ſo
incredible in the eyes of all men. For when
as Peter made his Sermon immediatly
after Chriſtes aſcenſion into heauen, in an
vpper chamber in Ieruſalem, to all the diſciples,
and to the women which were there.
which were in all, both men and women,
ſixe ſcore, hee made mention of this to the
reſt, that there muſt one be choſen into the
roume and place of Iudas the traytour, to
be made a witnes of Chriſtes reſurrection,
Act. 1. verſ. 22. So that, although not only,
yet eſpecially the office of the Apoſtles
was, to declare and teſtifie with all diligence
and boldnes, the reſurrection of
Chriſt, to the people and Church of God.
Belike then, this reſurrection of Chriſt

doeth conteyne in it ſome notable myſterie,
and leſſon for our inſtruction: and ſurely
ſo it doeth. Seeing it is ſo, let vs come to
the ſeconde poynt which I noted, that was,
the benefite and great profite wee reape by
his reſurrection. This reſurrection was
great loſſe vnto Satan, but the ſame was
our gayne. For by it, death is ſwallowed
vp into victorie, and the bonds of the deuill,
whereby hee helde vs captiues at his will,
are all broken and daſhed in pieces, by this
victorious Lion of the tribe of Iuda. And
this is the firſt benefite, that eternall life,
which is y• free gift of God, Rom. 6. is now
giuen vnto vs. Then before this reſurrection,
we were in the ſhadow of death, ſitting
in blindneſſe and ignorance. Nowe ryghteouſneſſe
is reſtored: then ſurely before, we
were in our ſinnes, as Paul ſaith, If Chriſt
bee not ryſen, then are you as yet in your
ſinnes, 1. Cor. 25. Well, nowe that he is riſen,
all our ſinnes, are put away. Let vs apply
this doctrine to our ſelues, for our owne
conſolation and comfort, agaynſt Satan
and all his tentations, and let vs ſay of it as
Paul did, Galat. 2. I am crucified with
Chriſt, but I liue, (meaning by his reſurrection)
yet not I any more, but Chriſt liueth

in me. And in that that I nowe liue in
the fleſh, I liue by the fayth in the Sonne
of God, who hath loued me, and giuen
him ſelfe for me. So muſt euery one of vs
ſay, Chriſt hath ryſen againe for me, &amp; iuſtified
me, and ſaued me, in reſtoring life vnto
my dead body againe. Here ariſeth likewiſe
out of this, our duetie and thankefulneſſe to
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt for this great benefite,
not to forget it at any time, but as Moſes
ſayeth, Deut. 6. 6. ſo muſt wee doe: for
this is the precept and commaundement of
the eternall God, Theſe wordes or things
which I command thee this day, ſhall be
in thy heart, and thou ſhalt rehearſe them
continually vnto thy children, and ſhalt
talke of them when thou ſitteſt in thy
houſe, and whē thou walkeſt by the way,
and when thou lyeſt downe, and as thou
ryſeſt vp. So theſe benefites of Chriſt are
alwayes to be remembred. Alas, dearely
beloued brethren, if we woulde ſo thanke
and remember a friende of ours but a mortall
man, as we woulde neuer forget him,
but ſpeake continually of him, and prayſe
him to others, if hee ſhoulde beſtowe vpon
vs a tranſitorie and temporall gift, which
laſteth but for a time, as a thouſande pound

in money or goods, or an hundred pounde
lande a yeere, if (I ſay) we would thinke
this very much, and great loue: what ſhall
wee thinke of Ieſus Chriſt, and howe
ſhall wee bee able to thanke him ſufficiently,
and remember him ynough, which
hath beſtowed vpon vs his owne goodes
and treaſures, farre better then ſiluer and
golde, and all precious ſtones, yea, to the
which theſe things are but doung? and not
onely hath he giuen vnto vs his goods and
iewels:but he hath alſo giuen vnto vs moſt
faire and large poſſeſſions, euen the inheritance
of the kingdome of heauē, immortall,
vndeſtled, and which withereth not away,
as theſe inheritances here belowe doe.
Theſe things come vnto vs by his reſurrection,
and yet who almoſt of the hundred
part of men remembreth theſe benefits, and
receiueth them with thankeſgiuing accordingly?
Nay, who thinketh not more of his
lands and poſſeſſions here belowe, then of
thoſe aboue? Wel, they are the more fooles
and mad men, and altogether vnthankefull
to our good and louing Sauiour Ieſus
Chriſt, which doeth offer theſe things vnto
them, if they woulde receiue them. God
make them and vs al, one day thankefull for

them. Well, to conclude this point, let vs
marke and beholde, that he is riſen againe
frō death, wherin did appeare greater force
and power, then if he had at that time come
downe from the croſſe, whē the Iewes willed
him ſo to doe: for he did ſo vanquiſh and
ouercome death, ſtriuing with him in the
graue, that hee was not able with all his
force, to keepe him vnder his rule and gouernment.
If hee had bene ouercome, he
ſhould not haue ſaued vs. For it had bene al
one with vs, as with one ready to bee drowned,
and ſome other man to help and ſuccour
him, woulde couragiouſly leape into
the water, who in the ende ſhould be drowned
him ſelfe, before he could releeue the other:
what help then could come to the man
that firſt fell into the water? Truely no other
thing could enſue of this, but one euill
to folowe an other, and the death of the ſecond
man, to be added to the loſſe of ye firſt.
But this was farre otherwiſe in Chriſt,
who firſt deliuered him ſelfe from the tertors
of death and hell, that he might the better
perſwade vs of our ſaluation, as a ſure
anker, by faith in him alone. The ſecond benefit
that commeth to vs by Chriſts reſurrection,
is newnes of life, &amp; that we ſhould

mortifie our former: luſtes, in dying vnto
ſinne, and haue a newe life in all righteouſneſſe
and holineſſe, as we ſee Chriſt did riſe
againe with a glorified body, not ſubiect to
the like affections and paſſions as he was
before, to hunger and thirſt, to mortalitie
and other miſeries of the body, but had all
things as it were newe: ſo ſhoulde we alſo
ryſe with him from this olde life of ſinne,
wherein wee haue liued too long, and put
on a newe and a better life, that is, as Paul
ſpeaketh, to caſt off concerning the conuerſation
in time paſt, that olde man
which is corrupted through the deceyueable
luſtes: and that we ſhould be renewed
in the ſpirite of our minde, to put on
the newe man, which after God is created
vnto ryghteouſneſſe and true holineſſe.
This is the true image wherein
Chriſt is ryſen, and wherein we muſt alſo
ryſe: For ſurely (dearely beloued) as Chriſt
was rayſed from the dead to the glory of the
Father, ſo we alſo ſhoulde walke in neweneſſe
of life, Rom. 6. Then all they that doe
not leade a newe life and a Chriſtian, haue
not yet riſen with Chriſt, neither haue they
part of his reſurrection. For we muſt conſider,
that the ſcriptures of God do ſet forth

vnto vs two reſurrections: the one is of the
body at the generall daye of iudgement,
1. Corin. 15. Of this we ſhall heare more in
that article of ye reſurrection, &amp; this is common
to all, and is in the life to come, called
the ſeconde reſurrection, where of Iohn
ſpeaketh, Reuel. 20. The other reſurrection
is of the ſoule from ſinne, here in this life
cōmon to ye elect and childrē of God, which
are true members of Ieſus Chriſt, and
folowe him their head, and this is called the
firſt reſurrection, becauſe it goeth before
the other: and he that will haue his part of
the ſeconde reſurrection to life euerlaſting,
and not be hurt of the ſeconde death, muſt
while he liueth here, indeuour to ryſe from
ſinne. Of this reſurrection Saint Iohn in
the twentie of the Reuelation ſpake moſt
playnely, ſaying, Bleſſed and holy is hee
that hath his part in the firſt reſurrection,
for on ſuch the ſecond death hath no power,
but they ſhall be the Prieſtes of God
and of Chriſt, and reygne with him a
thouſand yeeres: that is to ſay, not a thouſande
onely, but for euer and euer, as
is moſt clearely in another place of the
ſame Iohn expounded, Chapter 22. verſe
5. in theſe wordes, The Lorde ſhall giue

them lyght, and they ſhall reigne for euermore:
Which by the way maketh agaynſt
the error of them, that imagined
that Chriſt ſhoulde reigne but a thouſande
yeere with his elect, and that vpon the earth
alſo. But to come to our matter againe,
from the which wee haue a litle digreſſed:
We ſee that there is alſo a reſurrection to
be ſought for here in this life, from ſinne.
Of this reſurrection ſpake S. Paul alſo
Epheſ. 5. ſpeaking to them that where fallen
downe &amp; aſleepe, or rather dead in ſinne:
Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ſtande vp
from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall giue thee
light. In this reſurrection from ſinne and
wickednes did Dauid ariſe, when hee had
ſlept, and was almoſt dead in adulterie, and
murder of Vrias, for the ſpace of one whole
yere and more: for when Nathan the Prophet
came vnto him, and ſharply rebuked
him for it, he repented and amended, and ſo
roſe againe to a lewe life afterwarde. So
did Saint Peter alſo riſe in this reſurrection,
when he had moſt wickedly and ſhamefully
denied &amp; forſworſte his maſter Chriſt:
for he went forth and wept bitterly: So he
roſe againe, Mark. 14. And ſo doe all the
godly:when they haue ſinned, they are ſory

for it, and by and by they ariſe by repētance,
and neuer intende to doe the like againe.
And verely ſo muſt we all doe, euery one of
vs from the hieſt to the loweſt, none muſt be
exempted, if we wil be Chriſts ſcholers and
diſciples, or haue any part with him in his
holy reſurrection. When we haue offended
our maſter Chriſt, let vs be moſt heartily ſorie
for it, lament and amendc, and ſerue him
better afterwarde, taking heede of the like
offences againe: then ſhall wee haue our
part in this reſurrection, &amp; ſo be bleſſed for
euer. Nowe the wicked and reprobate, becauſe,
when they haue ſinned, they can not
ryſe agayne by repentance with Peter and
Dauid, but rather lye ſtill vnder the burden
of their ſinnes, and ſo fall to deſpayre:
therefore they can haue no fellowſhippe in
this reſurrection. As for example, wee ſee
in Cain, haw he diſpayred when he had ſinned,Gen. 4. 14.
and neuer repented or amended his
life, Gene. 4. So did Saul: and ſo did king
Pharao confeſſe he had ſinned vnto ye Lord:
but yet he hardened his heart,Exod. 8.8 and 9. 28. and continued
ſtill in his ſinnes to prouoke the Lorde,
for he would not let Iſrael goe to ſerue the
Lorde, who did not ryſe in this reſurrection.
The like we haue of Eſau,Gen. 27.38. who wept in

deede, but not in godly ſorow that cauſeth
repentance vnto ſaluation, not to be repented
of, as yt Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, 2. Cor.
7. But he lamented in worldly ſorowe, that
cauſeth death, becauſe he amended not his
ſinfull life, Hebrew. 12. The like may bee
ſayde of Iudas, who fell as others of the
godly dyd into ſinne, but roſe not agayne
with them. Therefore the reprobate, when
they fall away, can not ryſe, becauſe they
can not bee renewed by repentance, ſeeing
they crucifie to them ſelues the Sonne of
God, and make a mocke of him, as Iulian
that wicked Emperour &amp; runnagate from
Chriſt, after he fell away from him, neuer
came to him againe. For it was vnpoſſible
for him ſo to doe, as Paul ſayeth, Hebr. 6.
verſe 4, 5, 6. But here let vs behold the peruerſe
dealing of man, and the vanitie of his
heart, when he ſhoulde be riſen with Chriſt
in his reſurrection, he riſeth with the deuil
to the toppe of all ſinne and wickedneſſe:
when he ſhould be aliue in al good workes,
he is dead in them, and quicke in all abominations:
many riſe, but not with Chriſt to ye
glory of God, but to their owne glory, ye gloof
the worlde: ſome to promotions &amp; prefermēts
by vniuſt and vnlawful meanes, ſome

to pride and ambition, ſome riſe early,
as Eſay, 5. Chapter ſayeth, But to followe
drunkenneſſe, and to practiſe their wicked
deuiſes, which they haue conceiued
in their beddes. Thus they riſe and haue a
reſurrection, but not in goodneſſe, but in
moſt filthie and abominable ſinne. For
where we ſhoulde be freſh and floriſhing as
good and greene trees, to bring forth good
fruite, left we be throwne downe and caſt
into the fire: we are dead &amp; withered, &amp; drie
in al goodnes, corrupt trees without fruite,
twiſe dead and plucked vp by the rootes.
This is a very miſerable thing, but yet
common to many. Wee ſee then by theſe
things, that the wicked liue in the thinges
wherein they ſhould dye, and die in ye things
wherein they ſhould be aliue before God, as
faith, hope, and loue of God, and heauen and
heauenly things: ſo that we may iudge, that
as yet they haue not atteyned to this reſurrection,
which Chriſt hath gotten and obtained
for vs by his riſing again. Wel, to conclude
this leſſon, let vs that are riſen with
Chriſt, ſeeke thoſe thinges that are aboue,
where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand
of God, and let vs ſet our affections vpon
heauenly thinges, and not earthly, for wee

are dead, and our life is hidde with
Chriſt in God, Coloſſians 3. verſ. 1. and ſo
let vs altogether mortifie our earthly members,
and fleſhly luſtes, fornication, euil concupiſcēce,
vncleannes, inordinate affectiō,
and couetouſnes, which is of all vices the
worſt, &amp; called Idolatrie: doing theſe things
in the firſt reſurrection, when Chriſt which
is our life ſhal appeare, then ſhall we alſo in
the ſeconde reſurrection appeare with him
in glory. The which aſſurance of our reſurrection
is the thirde benefite, we haue to
note in this reſurrection of Chriſt: for by it
we are made ſurc and certaine of the ryſing
againe of our bodies at the laſt and generall
day of iudgement, when Chriſt ſhal come to
iudge all the worlde in righteouſnes. I ſay,
that his riſing is the earneſt of our immortalitie,
not onely in our ſoules, but alſo in
our bodyes.2. Cor. 25. 
                     He is become the firſt fruits of
thē that ſleepe: and as in Adam we al die:
ſo again by Chriſt and his reſurrection, we
ſhal al be made aliue at the great and laſt
day, in as much as he is ye reſurrectiō &amp; the
life, and he that beleeueth in him, although
he were dead, yet ſhal hee liue, Iohn 11.
And hee is the head that is riſen, therefore
the body and all the members of the ſame

ſhal followe in due time. For as when a man
hath fallen into ſome deepe and dangerous
riuer, and hath nowe recouered his head
from vnder the water, and ſwimmeth aboue
out of danger with his head, although his other
parts &amp; members of his body be not yet
ſeene &amp; diſcouered, yet wil al mē ſay, he is eſcaped
from death already: ſo is it with our
head Ieſus Chriſt, and with vs his body.
Seeing he is eſcaped and tiſē from ye deepe
gulfe of death, (notwithſtanding wee ſeeme
as yet to be couered therein in this our mortall
ſtate) why may it not be iuſtly ſaide, that
we are riſen with him, being ſo neerely ioyned
and vnited vnto him, vnleſſe we will denie
him to bee our head? Wherefore, if wee
profeſſe our ſelues to be his, wee muſt lykewiſe
acknowledge that our reſurrection is
already begun in his, &amp; that we do by hope,
(which neuer maketh aſhamed) in this life
retaine ye aſſurance of that ſtate, which hereafter
wee ſhall with ful poſſeſſion &amp; accompliſhmēt
in heauen with him enioy for euer.
This can not bee but a great and ſingular
comfort to al the faithfull ſeruauntes of Ieſus
Chriſt, to conſider that their bodyes ſhal
not lie for euer in the graues, as the bodyes
of beaſtes do, but that they ſhall riſe againe

with Chriſt, which is before entred into heauen,
to prepare a place there for vs, that hee
may come againe at the laſt day to receiue
vs wholy vnto him ſelfe. If wee were by
the death of any friende of ours, made ſure
by good and ſufficient warrant of an hundred
pounde lande a yeere, howe greatly
woulde wee reioyce thereof both night and
day! And how ought we to reioyce continually,
beyng put in aſſurance by Chriſtes
death and reſurrection, not of landes and
goodes here, which are but ſhort and tranſitorie:
but of the poſſeſſion of the euerlaſting
and immortall kingdome of God, where
are pleaſures without ende, and ioyes without
any wearineſſe. O howe ought this to
ſtirre vs vp to be in loue with that life, but
eſpecially and aboue all things to loue him,
that was the authour and purchaſer of theſe
things vnto vs, euen Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne
of God, both God and man! I woulde to
God we did thinke of theſe thinges and conſider
deepely with our ſelues, what is prepared
for vs by his reſurrection: ſurely then
wee woulde not ſinne, at the leaſt we would
not wallo we with the ſowe, and delite in our
ſinnes as many men do, the more is the pitie.
Wel, this is the greateſt benefite we obteine

by this reſurrection, euen our owne riſing:
if it were not for this, we were not better
thē bruite beaſtes, yea farre worſe, eſpecially
the godly, who ſuffer many iniuries
and tauntes, with mockings and paynes of
the wicked: if they ſhoulde not be aſſured of
this grace and happineſſe, their life were very
miſerable, &amp; they ſurely would deſpaire.
But of theſe things which are very incident
to the article of our reſurrection, mo things
(by Gods grace) ſhal be ſpokē, whē we come
to that point. In the meane ſeaſon (dearely
beloued) let vs giue to Ieſus Chriſt moſt
humble and heartie thankes, for the benefits
that we receiue of his gratious goodnes, by
his victorious reſurrection, in that hee hath
gotten to vs life, and opened the gates of
paradiſe vnto vs, which were ſhutte before.
And with all, becauſe we neede continually
to craue many thinges at his handes, let vs
meekely pray vnto him, that hee woulde
vouchſafe to woorke ſo in our harde heartes
by his holy ſpirit, that we may by his reſurrection,
mortifie and kil all the wicked &amp; vnruly
deſires of ye fleſh, &amp; other ſinnes which
are crept into vs, and beg we of him, that we
may all of vs, leaue the olde finfull life of
Adam, and walke in a newe life, and put on

the newe man Ieſus Chriſt, and to make
no prouiſion for the vnbrydled fleſh, to fulfil
the luſtes of it, that we may walke before
him, and ſerue him, not for a day, or weeke,
or moneth, or yere,Luke 1. 75. but as ye holy ghoſt ſaith,
al the dayes &amp; times of our life, in holineſſe
and true righteouſneſſe, to his honour and
glorie, to the profite and commoditie of his
Church, our brethren, and in the ende, to the
conſolation and comfort of our own ſoules,
which God graunt vs for his ſonnes ſake:
to whom with the holy ſpirit, be rendred all
praiſe, and glory, and wiſedome, and thanks,
and honour, and power, and might, for euermore,
Amen.
               
               
                  
                  The ſixt Lecture vpon
the ſixt article of our Chriſtian
fayth:
                  He aſcended into heauen, and ſitteth on the
right hand of God the father almighty.
                  
                     THis is the ſixt Article of our
Chriſtian faith, yet but the fift of
thē that appertaine to Chriſt &amp;
his benefites, from his conception,
to this his aſcenſion into heauen: and
it followeth conſequently in order after his
reſurrection, not but that there was ſome
time and ſpace betweene: for Luke doeth
recken fourty dayes, to this ende, that hee
might inſtruct and confirme his diſciples
in the veritie of his reſurrection: to the
which ende he did eate and drinke with thē
after he was riſen. Nowe the meaning of
this article in mo wordes (for the capacitie
and vnderſtanding of the ſimple and vnlearned)
is this: I that am a Chriſtian, doe
beleeue, according to the ſcriptures, that
Ieſus Chriſt in the ſame body that he roſe,
is aſcended into heauen, for to prepare a
place for me, and to pray continually vnto

God his father for vs, to bee mercifull
vnto our ſinnes. This is the true ſenſe and
meaning of this article. Now let vs conſider
what things wee haue to learne out of
it, and how many pointes to marke for our
inſtruction, be in it. There are three things
in this article: firſt, his aſcenſion, ſecondly,
to what ende he is aſcended, laſtly, the benefites
that come to vs by this his aſcenſion
into heauen. Theſe things well marked,
will be for our conſolation and comfort,
againſt many temptations and troubles
in this life, which the deuill aſſaulteth
vs with, that we ſhould deſpaire of the mercie
of God in Ieſus Chriſt. But this will
be a remedy for them all, euen his aſcenſion
into heauen, and that for vs. Chriſtes aſcending
into heauen, is manifeſtly proued vnto
vs in the holy ſcriptures, not in one or
two places, but in many, that we may be ye
better confirmed in this behalfe, either againſt
thē that doubt of it, or beleeue it not,
yea, or againſt Satan, that wil go about to
perſwade vs that he is not there. S. Marke
doth ſhew vs, that after the Lord had ſpokē
certaine things vnto his diſciples in Bethanie,
he was receiued into heauen, and ſate
at the right hand of God, Mark. 16. 19. for

thoſe are his very words in ye place. Likewiſe
S. Luke ſaith,Luke 24. 
                     And it came to paſſe that
as he bleſſed thē he departed from thē, &amp;
was caried vp into heauen. Neither do the
Euangeliſts &amp; Apoſtles of Chriſt proue
this only vnto vs which were after him, &amp;
had familiarity with him, but the Prophet
Dauid, to make it ye more euident to all the
world, long before the cōming of Chriſt in
the fleſh, ſpake of it by ye ſpirit of prophecie,
moued by the direction of ye holy ghoſt, ſaying,
God is gone vp with triumph, euē the
Lorde, with the ſound of the trumpet: alluding
in this aſcenſion of Chriſt, for the
glory &amp; ioyfulnes of it, vnto the trūpets ye
were blowē at ye ſolēne feaſts of ye Iewes,
Pſal. 47. Alſo in the 68. Pſal. Thou art gone
vp on hie, thou haſt led captiuitie captiue.
We ſee then ye in the mouth of two or three
witneſſes, this matter is proued vnto vs, &amp;
ought therfore to be beleeued of vs, &amp; fully
eſtabliſhed. But becauſe no man doth (as I
thinde) ye is a Chriſtiā, doubt of this, neither
is it in controuerſie betweene ye Papiſts &amp;
vs, as cōcerning his aſcenſiō (although in ye
maner of it there be cōtention) I wil therefore
come to the ſecond point, which is to
conſider how, &amp; after what ſorte he is aſcended,

and remaineth in heauen, and to what
ende, ſignified in theſe words, and ſitteth at
the right hād of God the father almighty.
To ſit at Gods right hande,What it is to ſit at Gods right hand. is to haue, and
to be aboue all rule, power, might and dominion,
&amp; euery name that is named, not
onely in this world, but alſo in the worlde
to come, Ephe. 1. It is then as our ſauiour
Chriſt ſaith, Matt. 11. and 28. To haue all
things giuē vnto him, al authoritie, both in
heauen and in earth. For the right hand of
God, ſignifieth the euerlaſting and infinite
power of God. Wee muſt not thinke, that
God being an infinite &amp; moſt bleſſed ſpirit,Iohn 1. 18. and 4. 24.
and not a body, hath either right hand or
lefte, eyes or armes, or ſuch like partes and
members of a mās body:but when ye ſcripture
giueth theſe properties &amp; ſpeaches vnto
God, (as it doth often) it is for our weaknes
and capacitie, which are children and
babes in Gods matters, &amp; therfore can not
vnderſtand him in his maieſtie ſpeaking to
mā, vnles he liſpe (as it were) vnto vs, like a
nurce vnto her young children. For we are
ſo groſſe, that we vnderſtād not how greatly
the Lord is angry with mā for his ſinne
&amp; wickednes, vnles he ſpeake after ye maner
of men, &amp; ſay, he repenteth yt euer he made

man. Againe we vnderſtād not, or conceiue
his wonderfull power and ſtrength, except
it be by a great and mighty and ſtretched
out arme or hande. So by the eyes of the
Lord is meant his carefull &amp; vigilant prouidence
&amp; foreſight ouer all his creatures,
and by his countenance is moſt commonly
meant his terrible wrath and anger. When
the ſcripture giueth an eare to God, &amp; whē
the preachers ſaye in their Sermons, that
he hath an eare: you muſt vnderſtand that
he heareth all things bee they neuer ſo ſecretly
ſpoken of any man, as by his eye, hee
ſeeth al things in this world, although they
be neuer ſo much hid, and done in darke &amp;
ſecret places, as the wicked doe their euill
workes. As we ſee then that kings and noble
men do place at their right hande, ſuch
as are either their betters, or equals, or doe
gouerne in their ſteade, ſo is it here: Chriſt
is exalted and placed in that dignitie &amp; honour
that his father is, becauſe he is equall
vnto him. And this latter part of ye article,
to ſit at Gods right hand, being in the laſt
chapter of Marke, from whence it ſeemeth
this was taken, S. Paul doth expounde very
well in ye 1. Epheſ. that God hath ſet him
farre aboue all principalitie and power, &amp;

might and domination. And in an other
place, Philip. 2. hath highly exalted him,
and giuē him a name aboue euery name,
that at the name of Ieſus ſhoulde euery
knee bowe, both of things in heauē, and
things in earth, &amp; things vnder the earth,
and that euery tongue ſhoulde confeſſe
that Ieſus Chriſt is the Lorde, vnto the glory
of God the father. This is the meaning
of theſe words, he ſitteth at the right hand
of God. It is not of any corporall ſitting,
for it may as wel be ſayd, that he ſtādeth at
the right hand of God: For ſo did Saint
Stephen ſee him, Actes 7. Therefore both
by ſitting and ſtanding there, is meant, that
he is aduaunced to great glorie, as hath
bene ſayde already. And here in this his
aſcenſion, ſo glorious is his kingdome to
be ſeene, which hee did not take vpon him
here in the earth. So that although Chriſt
did ſhewe great glorie in his reſurrection,
all mortalitie being layde away, yet by his
aſcenſion into heauen, hee hath more notably
declared his power: for now he gouerneth
all things, and ruleth as a king ouer
all the earth. And this doeth the Apoſtle
teache vs, that he aſcended farre aboue all
heauens, to fulfill all things. For we ſee, and

reade how aboundantly, and moſt miraculouſly
he powred downe his holy ſpirit vpō
his Apoſtles, Act. 2. howe he hath increaſed
his church and kingdome in euery part of
the earth, how he hath euer ſince his aſcenſion,
mightily defended his, &amp; ſharply puniſhed
his enemies. So that although he be
in heauen according to his bodily preſence,
and not in earth (as the Lutheranes &amp; Papiſtes
do imagine him to be in the communion,
contrary to this article, he aſcended,
which is to be meant only of his body, &amp; not
of his diuine nature, which doeth fill all
things, &amp; needeth not to deſcend or aſcend:)
yet (I ſay) Chriſt is with vs, as hee him ſelfe
ſaith, euen vnto the end of the world, Mat.
28. 19. by his power &amp; ſpirit, &amp; by his grace
and godhead, which is euery where. For
he ſayeth, that he will not leaue vs fatherles,
but will come vnto vs: which he meant
by ſending his ſpirit, Iohn 14. We are not
then to looke for Chriſtes body here nowe
vpon the earth, (as certaine heretikes do
ſuppoſe) euen as he him ſelfe ſaith, Matt.
26. Me ſhal you not haue alwayes. Surely
this ſaying can by no meanes be true, if his
body be euery where, in euery place, at euery
ſacrament: then is not his body departed

from vs, then is he not aſcended into heauen,
but remaineth here ſtill in the earth.
But the Angell ſayde to the women, that
he was not there. That was ſome place, &amp;
then he had a glorified body. And it is ſaid,
that heauen muſt conteine him, vntill all
things bee reſtored, Act. 3. Surely being
now aſcended in body, we neither reade of,
nor beleeue any other deſcenſion in body,
then that wherein he ſhall deſcēde to iudge
at the latter day: as the Angels ſpake to ye
diſciples, This Ieſus which is taken vp frō
you into heauen, ſhall ſo come, as ye haue
ſeene him go into heauen. So that vnles
we ſee Chriſt ſo come down as he went vp,
we will not beleeue ye papiſtes, yt ſay he is
in the boxe or pixe, much leſſe them that ſay,
he is euery where, making him in deede to
haue no body at all, but altogether ſwallowed
vp by his diuinitie. For tell mee, I
pray you, if Chriſt had meāt his body ſhould
alway remaine here vpon the earth, why
did he ſay that he muſt depart from them?
They cannot meane it of his diuinity, but of
his humanitie. Againe, what needed his diſciples
to bee ſo ſorowefull for his going away,
if they had had his body with them?
Here they anſwere, The diſciples had not

his body viſibly, but his body inuiſible or
not ſeene. But ſurely the diſciples, if they
had vnderſtoode it ſo, as the Papiſtes ſay,
of his inuiſible body, they were not ſuch
children, but that they would haue contented
them ſelues, as well with his inuiſible
body, as his inuiſible ſpirit, and grace afterwardes:
therfore they would needes know
howe they ſhould be comforted when hee
was gone from them. Chriſt told them, by
his ſpirite, although inuiſible, and not by
his body inuiſible, which ſurely would haue
comforted them, although they ſaw it not,
if it had then bene with them, as his ſpirite
was: but Chriſt meant no ſuch thing, and
therefore promiſed euer his ſpirit to them,
and all others after, and not his inuiſible
body. This is a plaine caſe, but I leaue to
diſcourſe of it any further, becauſe I intend
in this booke to edifie and inſtruct the
ſimple readers, onely in the poyntes of
Chriſtianitie, concerning their faith, and
not to make any treatiſe for the learned.
Seeing then wee haue a great hie Prieſt,
which is entred into heauē, euen Ieſus the
ſonne of God, let vs hold faſt our profeſſiō,
as the Apoſtle ſayth, and let vs goe boldly
vnto the throne of grace, that we may receyue

mercie, and finde grace to helpe
in time of neede. For this was the third
point, that I ſayde was to be obſerued of
vs, to weigh with our ſelues, what profit
and commodity thereby doeth enſue
to all the faythfull, that hee is in heauen.
Surely, this cannot be but great comfort
to al the faithful: for they all are aſſured by
Chriſtes aſcenſion, that they alſo ſhall one
day, euen at the reſurrection of their bodies,
aſcende with him: for he is gone to
prepare a place for them, as he teſtifieth in
Iohn. 14. I goe to prepare a place for you,
and if I goe to prepare a place for you, I
will come agayne, and receyue you vnto
my ſelfe, that where I am, there may ye
be alſo. Chriſt by his aſcenſion hath opened
the gates and doores of heauen, and
Paradiſe for vs, which were ſhut againſt
vs before, ſo that wee had no entrance
thither. For this is moſt certayne and
true, that if the head be there, then ſhall
the body and members be there alſo:
and if our captayne be there, then ſhall his
ſouldiers, which are we, be one day with
him, and the maſter will haue there his
ſeruantes to wayte and attend vpon him
in his houſe. And to be ſhort, ſeeing Chriſt

is in heauen, he wil haue his true Chriſtians
to be with him. Is not this a great
comfort in all troubles, and hurlyburlies
in this life, to meditate vpon this, that one
day we ſhall come into the preſence of our
louing Maſter Ieſus Chriſt? Surely this
would comfort any poore afflicted ſoule or
body, if he did remember it: but we forget
it, and then what ioy can wee haue in this
vale of miſerie? This comforted Dauid in
his baniſhment, ſaying, When ſhal I come
to appeare before the preſence of God?
This reioyced Paul greatly, when he ſayd,
A crowne of righteouſneſſe is layde vp
for me in that day, when the Lord ſhal appeare,
2. Timothie 4. So then, this is the
firſt, and one of the greateſt benefites, that
by Chriſtes aſcenſion, wee haue an aſſurance
of our owne. For when Chriſt
ſhall appeare, then ſhall we alſo appeare
with him in glory, Coloſsians 3. But
yet wee muſt remember, that as Chriſt
firſt ſuffered ſhame and reproche, and
bitter death alſo, and ſo in the ende
entred into heauen, by diuers croſſes
and calamyties, ſo muſt wee alſo for
the moſt part, enter in the ſame way
with him: for by many tribulations muſt

we enter into the kingdome of heauen, and
all that wil liue godly in Ieſus Chriſt, ſhal
ſuffer perſecution. For you knowe that the
ſeruant muſt not looke to be better handled
thē his maſter, or ye ſcholer, to be in better
caſe then his teacher, nor we thē Chriſt.
Againe, Chriſt by his aſcenſion doth ſolicite
al our ſutes, cauſes, matters &amp; iniuries,
which we ſuffer, to God his father. For hee
is our Atturney, &amp; pleadeth for vs, as Iohn
ſayth, If any man ſinne, we haue an aduocate
with the father, Ieſus Chriſt the righteous.
Is it not a great comfort to a poore
man, that can not make friendes, or come
vp to the prince, becauſe of coſts and charges,
to haue alway one of the priuy counſell
to helpe and further his ſutes as readily
and diligently, as if hee were there himſelfe?
So ſurely it is with vs: wee haue alwayes
Ieſus Chriſt at hand with God his
father, being of his moſt priuy and ſecrete
counſell, to make requeſtes to God for vs
continually, to pardon our ſinnes, to grant
vs grace and all other thinges neceſſary.
This is ſingular ioy to a godly heart, ſo yt
wee neede not to ſeeke any other Mediatour,
as the Papiſtes doe, as if hee were
not ſufficient of him ſelfe, or as mercifull

to heare vs, as his mother, or Peter, or any
other ſaynt in heauen. This is their folly,
and madnes: let vs be contented with
our only Mediatour Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe
he is moſt able, and moſt willing to heare
vs, yea biddeth vs to come to him for our
cauſes, Matthewe 11. Come vnto me all
ye that trauell and are laden, and I will
refreſhe you. Therefore we may boldly
and ſafely goe vnto him in our neede and
neceſſitye, and feare not. Which of vs is it,
that if the prince did byd vs come at the
firſt to her, and not to any other of her priuy
chamber, but would come moſt willingly,
and be glad ſo to do? Why thē come
wee not to God at the firſt, ſaying in
his worde. Cal vpon me, in the day of thy
trouble, and I will heare thee? Why come
wee not to Chriſt, that ſo louingly biddeth
euery one of vs? Wel, let vs holde this for
an vnfallible principle: Chriſt being aſcended,
is our onely ſpokeſman, neither
let any man thinke, that it is with Ieſus
Chriſt, the king of all kings, as it is with
princes of the earth, that becauſe he is ſo hie
and in ſo great dignitie and maieſtie, hee
doth not therefore regarde, or reſpect vs
here vpon the earth ſo lowe: nay, Dauid

telleth vs the contrary, and meeteth with
this obiection: for hee ſayth, In deede the
Lorde is hie aboue al nations, and his glory
aboue the heauens. But yet hee ſayeth,
that he abaſeth himſelf to behold ye things
in heauen and in earth: yea, he rayſeth the
needy out of the duſt, &amp; lifteth the poore
out of the dounghill, to ſet him wt princes,
Pſal. 113. So we ſee, although the Lord be
hye, yet he hath reſpect vnto the lowly. And
Ieſus Chriſt, notwithſtanding he be in all
pleaſure, &amp; bleſſednes, yet he thinketh vpon
vs, becauſe he hath ſometyme felt y• like miſeries
with vs: &amp; we haue ſuch an hie Prieſt,
that can be touched with our infirmities,
euen at this time alſo, as he ſayde to Paul
perſecuting his ſayntes, Saul, Saul, why
doeſt thou perſecute me? Chriſt counted
himſelfe then to be perſecuted, although he
were in heauen, becauſe his poore members
were afflicted, Actes. 9. In deede princes
here, and noble men with vs many
tymes knowe not the miſery of others, nay
regarde it not, becauſe they haue neuer felt
the like ſmart, and knowe not what hunger,
or thirſt, or nakednes, or impriſōment,
or baniſhmēt, or lacke of lodging meaneth,
not hauing ſuffered the like themſelues.

But (I ſay) ye caſe is farre otherwiſe with
Chriſt, who knoweth better what we lack,
then we our ſelues doe, and hath borne the
like burden with vs, and doeth not forget
vs nowe in his glory and honor, as many
do their poore friends, whē they are aduanced
to any promotion &amp; dignitie by others.
Wherefore as Ioſeph in all his rioltie and
glory, remembred &amp; did acknowledge his
poore brethren before Pharao, and all his
houſe: ſo doeth vndoubtedly our Sauiour
Chriſt thinke vpon vs, his poore brethren,
ſaying, I will declare thy name vnto my
brethren, and he wil not be aſhamed to
confeſſe vs in heauen before his father,
and all his holy Angels. For howe ſhould
the head be aſhamed of his body, or the huſband
of his wife? Chriſt is not aſhamed of
vs his ſpirituall kinred, as we are aſhamed
of our kindred many times, when we are
exalted aboue them: nay, hee is neuer aſhamed
of vs, vnleſſe wee be firſt aſhamed
of him. For then in deede hee ſayth, Hee
that is aſhamed of me and my ſayings
here in earth before men, I wil alſo be aſhamed
of him in heauen before my father:
and he that ſhal denye him here, hee

wil deny him there: but hee that ſhal confeſſe
him here, he will confeſſe him there.
Mar. 8. Furthermore we are to vnderſtand,
that although Chriſt by his aſcenſion hath
taken away his body from the earth, which
was not neceſſary for vs, yet he hath left vnto
his Churche, and giuen vnto it, as a
moſt ſure and firme pledge, and earneſt peny
of his good will towardes vs, his holy
ſpirit alway crying in our heartes, Father,
father, &amp; working in vs, that which is good
&amp; acceptable in his ſight. This is the greateſt
comfort that may be to the faythful in
this lyfe, and therefore is this ſpirit oftentimes
called by our ſauiour Chriſt, The cō
                     forter.
And this great and ſingular benefit
we haue by his aſcenſion: for he ſayde, that
vnleſſe hee went his way from them, the
comforter would not come, but if he went,
he would ſend him, as in deede he did after
his aſcenſion moſt plentifully, and doeth
at this day vnto his giue his ſpirit, either
in greater or leſſer meaſure, to ſome more,
to ſome leſſe, as hee thinketh good. This
benefite then doe wee enioy by his bodily
preſence, departing for a time from vs.
This gift is to our ſoules, the fountayne of
life, and the very welſpring &amp; beginning

of all our Chriſtian regeneration and newe

                        〈◊〉
                      in Chriſt, and ſo is called the ſpirit of
Adoption, becauſe it is proper to Gods children,
and none other. This ſpirit doth leade
vs into al trueth, mortifieth our euil deedes,
killeth ſinne in vs, reuiueth all goodneſſe
within vs, maketh vs merry in the Lorde,
reioyceth vs in troubles, and doeth neuer
leaue vs deſtitute altogether of ſome comfort
or other. For this pledge out of our
hearts can neuer be taken away, all other
worldly things may be taken away, as from
Iob they were, who loſt his goods &amp; lands,
wife, friendes and children: his bodye was
afflicted, his ſoule tormented, yet in the
middeſt of theſe calamities he had a comfort
of this ſpirite, in that he coulde ſay in fayth,
I knowe that my redeemer liueth: which
he 
                        •
                     therwiſe coulde not doe, but by the motion:
and helpe of the holy Ghoſt, as Paul

                        •
                     eacheth vs, to the firſt Corinthians the

                        ••
                     el
                        •
                     t Chapter, in theſe wordes, I declare
vnto you brethren, that no man can ſaye
that Ieſus is the Lorde, but by the holy
Ghoſt, verſe 3. Seeing then wee haue by
Chriſts aſcenſion the firſt fruites of his ſpirit,
we ought alſo to aſcende with him into

                        〈◊〉
                     , if not in body, yet in ſoule, in minde

and heart, and all our affections. For where
our treaſure is, there ſhoulde our hear the
alſo. Our treaſure▪ and only treaſure Chriſt
Ieſus is in heauen, therefore let our hearts
he wholy with him, as Paul ſaith, Our conuerſation
is in heauen, from whence wee
looke for the Lord Ieſus, who ſhall tranſfourme
our vile body, that it may be made
like to his glorious body▪ Phil. 3. So that
as wee haue to learne by Chriſtes reſurrection,
a ſpirituall reſurrection here in this
life from ſinne: In like ſort we learne alſo
by theſe wordes of Saint Paul, an holy
and ſpirituall aſcenſion into heauen by our
deſires and thoughts, that we may ioyne to
him euen nowe in fayth and ſpirite, till wee
all meete in body there at the faſt day. And
truely if we coulde keepe our mindes ſo aſcending
vp into heauen, it woulde be very
benificiall for vs, and ridde vs out of many
daungers. Wee ſee and learne by experience,
that the byrde is neuer inſnared and
caught of the fouler, vntill he lyght and ſit
vpon the earth: whē he falleth to ye ground,
then is hee ſubiect to gunſhatte, or other
ſnares and daungers. So it is with vs: if
our mindes were fixed aboue, vpon heauenly
things, Satan coulde not take vs in his

trappes, but when they are altogether caſt
downewarde vpon the earth, and earthly
pleaſures, then we fall into his baytes, and
are entangled in his grennes. Therefore
as Chriſt is aſcended, ſo let vs alſo aſcende
in minde &amp; cogitation vnto him: for Chriſt
doeth bidde vs tome vnto him, and this ſaying
ſtandeth in his full force nowe, as it did
when 
                        •
                     e ſpake it here with vs vpon ye earth:
and we muſt come vnto him nowe. Let vs
then come and reſorte vnto him by our earneſt
and heartie prayer: for then wee talke
with him▪ For prayer is ſayd to be a ſpeach
and communication with God, and a lifting
vp of our heartes vnto him in heauen. We
ſhoulde remember then, that as often as we
pray, we ſpeake to the maieſtie of God, and
therefore ſhoulde come with feare and reuerence.
Let vs alſo come to Chriſt, to heare
h
                        ••
                      comfortable worde and Goſpel. For
when we heare his worde preached vnto vs,
or reade it our ſelues, we muſt conſider that
God ſpeaketh vnto vs: and therefore giue
diligent and attentiue heede to the things
thou heareſt, leſt they ſlip out of thy minde.
Againe, let vs alſo aſcend and come to him
by heartie thanke ſgiuing, for al benefits receyued
in our body and ſoule, both temporall

and ſpirituall. This is to aſcende vnto
Chriſt in this life. Seeing therefore yt by
the blood of Ieſus, we may be bold to enter
into the holy place, by the new &amp; liuing way
which he hath prepared for vs, through the
vaile, that is, his fleſh, &amp; ſeeing alſo we haue
an high Prieſt, which is ouer the houſe of
God, let vs all draw neere with a true heart
in aſſurance of fayth, our hearts being pure
from an euill conſcience, and waſhed in our
bodies with pure water: Let vs keepe the
profeſſion of our hope without wauering,
and let vs aſcende whither our forerunner
Ieſus Chriſt is entred and aſcended for vs
already, euen into the heauen of heauens.
Another ſingular cō
                     
                        •
                     ort

                        •
                     ead our faith
vpon by Chriſts aſcenſion, is his power to
ſtrengthen our weakeneſſe: for we beleeue
nowe, that Chriſt hath taken full poſſeſſion
of his moſt glorious kingdome, &amp; is entred
into glory, to whom as Saint Peter ſayth,
The angels, and powers, and myght are
ſubiect, and whatſoeuer elſe. For God
hath ſayde vnto him, Sit thou at my right
hande, vntill I make thine enemies thy
footeſtoole: the Lord ſhall ſend the 
                           •
                        odde
of thy power out of Sion, be thou buler
in the middeſt of thine enemies▪ Pſal. 110.

So that wee may boldly ſaye as Dauid
ſayde ſometime, The Lorde is our ſhephearde:
yea, the Lorde Ieſus is our King,
therefore ſhall wee lacke nothing. For
tel me I pray you, what good thing can we
want, Chriſt being our heauenly King,
and hauing nowe all power and authoritie
giuen vnto him, and ſitting at the ryght
hand of the almightie Father? Surely his
ſeruantes ſhall enioy all things, as he ſayeth,
He that ouercommeth ſhall inherit all
things, and who is he that ouercommeth,
but Ieſus Chriſt, in whome we by his power
and vertue ouercome alſo? that as
hee is made heyre of all things, ſo myght
wee alſo bee made ioynt heyres with him.
Wherefore wee knowe Chriſt no more in
his mortalitie, and humilitie. Yea although
wee had knowen Chriſt after the fleſh,
yet hence foorth knowe we him no more
after the fleſh, but after the woorking of
his myghtie Spirite, whereby hee is able
to ſubdue all things to him ſelfe, Philip. 3.
For here we muſt conſider, that Chriſt hath
thus aſcended into glorie for vs, and hath
receyued giftes for men, euen great ſpoyles
of the enemies, to enrich his Church. This
is our reioycing which wee haue dayly in

Chriſt Ieſus: here is the ioy, patience, and
victorie of the Saints of God, for he muſt
reigne, vntill hee hath put all his enemies
vnder his feete. Who then can he diſcouraged
with any thing that befalleth vnto him,
eyther of bodie, or griefe of minde, or loſſe
of goods and friends? Is it not Chriſt that
dyed for vs, and which is ryſen againe,
who is alſo at the ryght hande of God, and
maketh requeſt for vs? Who ſhall ſay any
thing vnto our charge? who ſhal condemne
vs? If Chriſt be on our ſide, as hee is moſt
certaynely, being our head, who then can
bee agaynſt vs? howe can wee ſacke any
thing in this lyfe, when God hath giuen
his Sonne for vs? What man or woman
woulde thinke to lacke any thing earthly,
that had a King to his Father, or a Prince
to bee his brother? and ſhall wee bee of
ſo litle fayth, to thinke that wee can lacke
ought, hauing GOD the great King
ouer al the world, to be our louing Father,
and Ieſus Chriſt his Sonne, the Prince
of all princes to bee our owne brother?
This were madneſſe to thinke or conceiue:
but yet if wee bee wauering through incredulitie,
let vs ſaye and waye with the
man in the Goſpel, Lorde helpe my vnbeliefe:

and with the Apoſtles let vs
ſaye, Lorde increaſe our fayth in vs, and
make it ſtrong agaynſt all tentations of
Satan. Seeing then that Ieſus Chriſt
is of that power, that he is able to bring
to paſſe all thinges, Gods children may
aſſure them ſelues of a ſingular defence
agaynſt all their enemies. For who
ſhall ſeparate vs from the loue of Chriſt?
Shall tribulation, or anguiſh, or perſecution,
or famine, or nakedneſſe, or
peryll, or ſworde? Nay (dearely beloued)
I am certaynely perſwaded, that neither
death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,
nor powers, nor thinges preſent,
nor thinges to come, nor heyght, nor
depth, nor any other creature ſhall bee able
to ſeparate vs from the loue of GOD,
which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lorde: for in
all theſe thinges wee are more then conquerours
through him that loued vs, and
this is our Chriſt that ſitteth in the heauens
for vs. By this his glorie and power
euer ſince his aſcending, hee hath mayntayned
the eſtate and welfare of his Congregation,
and will doe to the ende of the
worlde. The laſt thing wee learne by
Chriſtes aſcenſion, is this, that he is alſo

aſcended to leade captiuitie captiue, that
is to ſay, to beate downe and ouerthrowe
all his foes, and ſuch as ryſe vp heere agaynſt
him: ſo that as his power is a great
comfort to his ſpouſe, ſo it is as great a
terrour and griefe to the wicked reprobates,
to thinke or to conſider of it. For it
maketh them to frette and fume, and to
bee euer at their wittes ende for ſorowe
and griefe, that hee muſt ouercome in ſpite
of their teeth. Then wee learne, that our
enemies ſhall not alway tryumph ouer vs,
they ſhall not ſtill haue vs in their bandes,
in pryſon and thraldome, but one day they
ſurely them ſelues ſhall come to confuſion
and ſhame. The Scriptures, when they
will paynt out Chriſt vnto vs in mercie towarde
his Church, they giue him the name
of a meeke and gentle Lambe, apparelled
in white, making no ſturre or cry in the
ſtreetes, not breaking a bruſed reede, nor
quenching a ſmoking fla
                        •
                     e, Matthewe 12.
But when the Prophets will ſette foorth
Chriſt in his maieſtie and glorie, after his
aſcenſion, they giue him the name and propertie
of a fierce Lion, all apparelled in
redde and bloody garmentes, with a rodde

and ſcepter of iron in his hande to rule and
gouerne all nations. And this no doubt is,
to cauſe &amp; make the enemies of his Church
to quake, euen as hee ſhewed him ſelfe in a
viſion to Saint Iohn his beloued diſciple,
to comfort him no doubt, but to terrifie the
enemies which were ſhortly to goe about to
deſtroy the Church of God. Wee reade in
the Reuelation 1. cha. that as Iohn turned
backe to heare the voyce that ſpake wt him,
Chriſt ſhewed him ſelfe vnto him in his maieſtie,
as he was able to conceiue: for he ſaw
ſeuen goldē candleſticks, &amp; in the midſt of
the ſeuen golden candleſticks, one like vnto
the ſonne of mā, clothed with a garmēt
downe to the feete, and girded about the
pappes with a golden girdle: his head and
heares were white as white wooll, and as
ſnowe, and his eyes were as a flame of fire,
and his feete lyke vnto fine braſſe, burning
as in a furnace, and his voyce as the ſound
of many waters, and he had in his ryght
hand ſeuen ſtarres, and out of his mouth
went a ſharpe two edged ſwoorde, and
his face ſhone as the Sunne ſhyneth in
his ſtrength. This viſion of Chriſt in his
glorie was ſo fearefull, that it made Iohn
him ſelfe afrayde, but the Lorde dyd ſhewe

him ſelfe ſo, to comforte his ſeruauntes
which ſhould ſuffer perſecution a litle after,
but to threaten the enemies by his mightie
power. This is that which the holy Ghoſt
ſpake long ſince by Dauid, The Lorde
reigneth, let the people tremble, hee fitteth
betweene the Cherubims, let the earth be
mooued, the Lorde is great in Zion, and
he is hie aboue all people. The Lorde
that is at thy ryght hande, ſhall wounde
Kings in the day of his wrath, he ſhall bee
iudge among the heathen, he ſhall fill all
with dead bodyes, and ſmite the heades
ouer great countreys. Here wee ſee howe
Dauid ſpeaketh moſt magnificently of
this glorious kingdome of Chriſt, beyng
nowe exalted aboue the heauens by his aſcenſion:
howe hee aſſureth the enemies of
deſtruction, but promiſeth deliūerie to the
godly in the Church. As Chriſt did alwayes
deliuer his Church, euen from the beginning,
Noah from the flood, drowning the
reſt, Lot from Sodome, when hee conſumed
the remnant with fire, the Iſraelites
from the bondage of Egypt, and the tyranny
of king Pharao, ouerthrowing his
euennes in the redde ſea, for Chriſt was that

great Angel that went before them: likewiſe
in deſtroying the Aſſyrians ſo many
thouſandes in one nyght, and ſauing good
king Hezekia and the reſt, ſo did hee moſt
wonderfully deſtroy great Babylon, and
ranſome thence his owne priſoners: finally,
howe he deſtroyed the Edomites, the Ammonites,
the Moabites, the Philiſtims, and
the Canaanites, they that reade the hyſtories
of ye Bible, ſhal wel perceiue: as (I ſay)
Chriſt hath done theſe thinges to his enemies
before his incarnation, ſo eſpecially
after hee was receyued vp in glorie, hee
hath done the like. Howe mightily did hee
ſuppreſſe and beate downe the great rage
and furie of Saul, beyng armed and ſette
as a fierce Tyger, or Lion, to deſtroy both
man, woman and childe of Chriſts flocke?
But the Lorde Ieſus from heauen ſubdued
him, and made him as tame as a
Lambe, Actes 9. Did hee not cutte off inlyke
ſort that cruell tyraunt Herode, that
killed Iames, &amp; had alſo taken Peter? It is
ſayd, that in his pryde he gaue not GOD
the honour and glorye, and therefore was
immediatly ſtrooken of the angel, and moſt
ſhamefully eaten vp of wormes, Actes 12.

Howe Iulian the Emperour, that wicked
forſaker and perſecutour of the Chriſtians,
was handled by the iuſtice of God, and ended
his life miſerably. So Zomenus in
in his ſixt booke of his ſtorie, the ſeconde
Chapter, doeth ſufficiently declare, that
he was not killed by any of his enemies, but
by one of his owne ſouldyers: And when
he was ſtrooken with the darte, and wounded
to death, hee vnderſtoode well the cauſe
of it to bee, for perſecuting Chriſt and the
Chriſtians: for hee tooke the blood out of
his wounde, and flang it vp into the ayre,
as if hee had ſeene Chriſt, and accuſed him
of his death, as in deede hee was the chiefe
authour of it, to puniſhe that wicked reprobate,
which had ſo before contemned and
mocked his worde and Goſpel. They that
liſt to reade hiſtories, either prophane or diuine,
ſhall ſee howe the tyrantes, and murdering
Emperours of Chriſtes Church,
haue bene by Ieſus Chriſt in his glory taken
miſerably out of this life. Conſider all
the Emperours of Rome that perſecuted
the Church, what became of them, and howe
they dyed. Was not Nero that monſter,
partly by himſelfe, and partly by one of his
owne men, thruſt through with a dagger,

as Suetonius, and others do report? Galba,
Otho, and Vitellius, did they not ſuffer
the like? Did not Domitian deſtroy
his owne brother Titus, and poiſoned him?
and was not Titus a perſecuter of the
Iewes? Domitian was miſerably kylled
by one Stephanus his man, Maximinus
ſlayne by his owne armye, Commodus
kylled of Narciſſus, Macrinus thruſt thorowe
by his ſouldiers, Decius killed by
his enemies, Valerianus pearſed with a
ſpeare of the Perſians, Pilate after hee
had crucified our Sauiour Chriſt, within
fewe yeeres after, was hee not dryuen
to hang him ſelfe for ſorowe, as Iudas
did before him? Diocleſian and Maximinian,
which were the authours of the tenth
and laſt perſecution agaynſt the Chriſtians,
depoſed them ſelues of their imperial
function, by the ſecrete iudgement of God.
Maxentius the ſonne of Maximinian,
dranke of the ſame cuppe with Pharao, being
both like enemies againſt Chriſt and
his Church: for Maxentius was drowned
in the water with his harneſſe vpon
his backe. The Popes of Rome, being
as great perſecutours as euer were any,

of Chriſt and his Church, many of them
haue had very wretched and ſhamefull
endes. Alexander the ſixt, was taken away
with the deuill, by whome he aſpyred
to the papacie. Looke vpon our papiſtes in
Queene Maries dayes, and ſee howe a
great many of them dyed. Wee 
                        •
                     acke not
examples among vs euen freſh in memorie
in thoſe dayes. Let a men conſider with
himſelfe, the vnhappie and vnfortunate
endes of the laſt race of the kinges in
Fraunce, and he ſhall ſay, that Chriſt euen
in his glory doth marueilouſly defende
his Goſpel, with the profeſſours thereof,
&amp; rewardeth their enemies according to
their deſertes. So that a man may iuſtly
ſay and confeſſe with Dauid, Doubtees
there is a God that iudgeth in the earth,
ſurely there is a Chriſt that defendeth his
Church: for hee ſhall treade downe our
enemies vnder vs, and deſtroy them that
riſe vp againſt vs, Pſalme. 60. By theſe
examples then we may haue comfort &amp; perſwade
our ſelues that are the litle ſtocke of
Chriſt, y• as he hath done already, ſo he will
doe alway for his: for he is able ſtill▪ and his
hande is not ſhortned, but as long as it was,

neyther is he chaunged. And let vs with
Peter ſay and beleeue, that the Lorde
knoweth to deliuer the godly out of tentation,
and to reſerue the vniuſt vnto the
day of iudgement vnder puniſhment. I
woulde admoniſh therefore the wicked,
and the obſtinate, and perſecuting Papiſtes
of Chriſtes Goſpel, to learne to
take heede by theſe leſſons aboue rehearſed,
and not to goe on ſtil to prouoke and kindle
the great wrath and anger of Chriſt againſt
them, ſeeing hee is armed with vengeance
and te
                        ••
                     our agaynſt them, and nowe ſitteth
in his throne of maieſtie. Theſe are the
thinges that wee haue to beare in minde
vpon this article of our faith, concerning
Chriſt his aſcenſion. The firſt poynt was
of the aſcenſion it ſelfe, not into the
ayre or cloudes, but into heauen, proued by
the manifeſt woorde of God, the holy ſcriptures:
the ſeconde, the glory and power of
it, ſhewing the ende of it, which was, to ſitte
at Gods right hande, to gouerne all things:
the thirde poynt was the great aſſurance of
fayth that commeth to vs by it, and the
comfort that we conceiue by his ſo glorious
aſcenſion into heauen for vs. Nowe let vs

humble our ſelues before this Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt, in giuing him firſt moſt heartie and
intire thankes for all his benefites beſtowed
vpon vs, eſpecially for this, that hee hath
aſcended into heauen as a conquerour, and
taken poſſeſſion of heauen for vs alreadie:
and let vs pray vnto him, that as hee is aſcended
alreadie in body, ſo we in the meane
while may thither aſcende in minde and
heart, where true ioyes are only to be found.
And ſeeing he is made gouernour of heauē,
and earth and al, pray we him, that he would
gouerne and defende vs here in earth, by
the aſſiſtaunce of his holy ſpirite, tyll wee
all mee
                        •
                     e together at our generall aſcenſion
in the vnitie of faith, and acknowledging
of the Sonne of GOD, vnto a perfect
man, vnto the meaſure of the age of the fulneſſe
of him. And becauſe hee is of power
ſufficient, let vs beſeeche him, to brydle
and ſtoppe the mouthes of 
                        〈◊〉
                     , to
confounde Antichriſt, which ſeeketh by al
meanes to extinguiſh his trueth, that hee
would alſo haſten his 
                        〈◊〉
                      vnto iudgement
for his elects ſake, which grone vnder
the croſſe. Theſe things he graunt vnto vs,
which is able, euen Ieſus Chriſt the onely

wiſe, mighty, and immortall God, to whom
with his father, and his holy ſpirite, be rendred
all prayſe, and glory, and dominion,
for euer and euer: ſo be it.
               
               
                  The ſeuenth Lecture
vpon the ſeuenth article of our
Chriſtian faith:
                  From thence ſhall he come to iudge both the
quicke and the dead.
                  
                     THis is the ſeuenth article of our
beliefe, but the ſixt and laſt of thē
that cōcerne ye perſon of Chriſt,
and onely of all the reſt of the
fiue going before, remaineth to be fulfilled,
and in his time accompliſhed. For as concerning
the other articles of our ſauiour
Chriſtes perſon, which are the fiue former,
we beleeue moſt conſtantly, that they are al
already perfourmed and verified: namely,
firſt, that he hath bene conceiued, ſecondly,
borne, thirdly, died, fourthly, riſen, againe,
fifthly, and aſcended into heauen. Onely
this we beleeue yet to be to come, that is, to
iudge the quicke and the dead. The meaning
of this article is this: I that am a

Chriſtian man, womā, or childe, do beleeue
aſſuredly, that Chriſt ſhall come againe viſibly
in the great and latter daye of iudgement,
with glorie and power from heauen,
as he was ſeene to go vp accompanied with
his holy angels, to iudge al the world moſt
iuſtly, both thoſe that are already dead, and
thoſe that he ſhal finde aliue at his cōming,
and that none ſhall eſcape his iudgement
ſeate, 2. Cor. 5. to this ende, that the good
may be rewarded with euerlaſting life and
immortalitie, &amp; the wicked puniſhed with
euerlaſting death and deſtruction, from the
preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of
his power, 2. Theſ. 1. The Lord Ieſus euen
in this life, doeth ſhewe and ſet foorth vnto
all the worlde moſt wonderfull ſignes and
tokens, both of his mercy to the elect, and
iuſtice to ye reprobate: but becauſe his kingdome
is not of this worlde, therefore our
faith muſt amount hier to conſider of his
laſt comming, wherein hee ſhall ſhewe as
great glorie and maieſtie, as he did humilitie
and meekenes in his firſt comming in
the fleſh. For as we doe beleeue that he is
appointed of his father, to bee the ſauiour
and redeemer of mankinde: ſo doe we alſo

confeſſe him to be ordeined the great iudge
of the vniuerſall world, &amp; that it is he alone
that ſhall iudge with vnſpeakeable glory,
both great and ſmall at his appearance: ſo
that although many men thinke that there
is no generall iudgement, yet at the laſt,
they ſhall feele that this iudge ſhal ſummō
them all to appeare moſt fearefully before
his imperiall throne of maieſtie. And this
iudgement of Chriſt ſtandeth with good
reaſon and iuſtice, that it ſhould be openly
ſeene and perceiued of all men at the laſt,
leſt either the wiſedome of the fleſh or mās
reaſon, or the multitude of ye wicked ſhould
be able iuſtly to charge vs (as they do moſt
vniuſtly) that we faine to our ſelues a God,
a Lord, a Chriſt, and ſuch an head as neuer
ſheweth him ſelfe, nor was ſeene of men.
Wherefore to auoyde this ſlander and reproche
of the blaſphemous mouthes which
ſay, Where is now your God? let him ſhew
him ſelfe: we (I ſay) doe beleeue, that one
daye hee ſhall come to iudge the whole
earth. For this is that, that Saint Iohn
ſayeth in his Reuelation, 1. 7. Beholde,
he commeth with cloudes, and euery eye
ſhal ſee him, euen they which pearced him

through, and all kinreds of the earth ſhall
wayle before him, euen ſo, Amen. Let the
wicked men therefore, and the mockers of
this iudgement, triumphe neuer ſo much,
yet ſhall they not be able to hinder or diſanull
the deuice and purpoſe of the Lorde.
They doe in deede bende their tongues
like bowes, to ſhoote out blaſphemies againſt
the Lord, ſaying, Where is the promiſe
of his comming? But let thoſe men
vnderſtande, that as the Lorde Ieſus was
ſeene to goe vp into heauen, ſo ſhall hee
come downe agayne from heauen, as the
Angels of God reported, Actes 1. 11. And
albeit they will not beleeue it, but make a
ieſt of it, yet they ſhall feele it one daye to
their great payne and ſorowe. It is meete
then, and requiſite, that he that was (for our
ſaluation before the iudgement ſeat of mā)
vniuſtly condemned, ſhoulde ſhewe in the
ende howe great his iuriſdictiō and authoritie
ouer al fleſh is, and what his iuſtice requireth.
Seeing then we muſt all appeare
before the iudgement ſeate of Chriſt, to receiue
euery man according to his woorkes
which he hath done here in his body, whether
they be good or bad: for the more orderly
proceeding in this matter, let vs cō
                     ſider

howe many things are neceſſarily to
be marked in this iudgement. There are
ſeuen points to be obſerued in this matter:
firſt, the iudgemēt it ſelf, ſecondly, ye iudge,
thirdly, the perſons that ſhall bee iudged,
fourthly, the maner of this iudgemēt, after
what ſort it ſhall be, fiftly, the time, ſixtly, ye
place, and laſt of all, the finall cauſe or ende
of this iudgement, wherefore it is ordeined
and reſerued. But before we ſpeak of theſe
things in order, we muſt anſwere to an obiection,
which is cōmonly made of the vnſkilfull
and vnlearned againſt this iudgement:
for when they hear of this iudgemēt,
they aſke to what ende it ſhall be, ſeeing euery
man that dieth, is iudged already, either
to heauen, or els to hel, as ſoone as the
breath is out of his body: therefore it may
ſeeme that this day is ſuperfluous &amp; needeles.
To this we make anſwere, that iudgement
is of two ſortes, for there is a particular
iudgement, and a generall. In ye 
                     particular
iudgement of God, euery mā is iudged
in ſoule incontinently, as he departeth
this life, but this is for the ſoule only. In ye
generall iudgement, both the body &amp; ſoule
ſhalbe ioyned together, and ſo enter either
into ioye, if they beleeue in Chriſt, or into

payne, if they beleeue not. For vntill this
day the man is but vnperfit, as hauing the
ſoule onely in bliſſe, and not his bodye,
which ſhall in this iudgement bee rayſed
vp, and put vnto the ſoule. To this ende is
the generall iudgement: and this article
doeth proue vnto vs the reſurrection of
our bodies: for if all muſt bee iudged, euen
in the bodyes alſo, then the bodyes of
the dead muſt riſe agayne, and come to
iudgement, to receiue in their bodies, either
euerlaſting life to immortalitie, if
they haue done well here: or els euerlaſting
death, to their endles payne and
griefe. Agayne, this daye is to make manifeſt
vnto all men in the worlde, euery
mans eſtate, eyther to ſaluation or condemnation:
for all ſhall appeare together
before their iudge viſibly. The ſcripture
doeth make mention of three commings
of Chriſt. The one was in the fleſh
among the Iewes in very poore eſtate,
baſe and ſimple, when hee did redeeme vs:
this we doe beleeue to bee paſt and fulfilled
already according to the Prophets, againſt
that wicked opinion of the Iewes,
which deny he is come in the fleſh. Another
comming of Chriſt is by his holy ſpirite,

grace, power, and worde into our heartes:
and when his miniſters doe come vnto
vs in his name to preache his worde and
Goſpell vnto vs, then is he ſayde to come
vnto vs. Of this cōming vnto euery faithfull
mans conſcience, our ſauiour ſpeaketh
of in the 14. of Saint Iohns Goſpel on this
wyſe, If any man loue me, hee will keepe
my worde, and my father will loue him,
and we will come vnto him, and dwell
with him. And againe, a litle before, He
that loueth me, ſhalbe loued of my father,
and I will loue him, and will ſhewe mine
owne ſelfe vnto him. So we doe pray that
his kingdome of grace may come vnto
vs, and wholy poſſeſſe our heartes and
myndes. But neither of theſe commings
doe wee ſpeake of in this place. The thirde
comming of Chriſt is to iudgement moſt
royally in his glorious kingdome, with all
his mighty and holy Angels, and whole
number of his Saintes, at the laſt daye,
when all ſhall appeare before him. The
laſt iudgement of Chriſt (which was the
firſt part of our diuiſion) is moſt certayne
and ſure to come: if any doubt of it,
let him reade theſe places for his confirmation,
for to recken thē all vp, were too long

and tedious a matter: Matth. 24. 25. Mark.
13. Luke 21. Iohn 5. Act. 1. 17. &amp; 10. chap.
Rom. 14. 1. Cor. 15. 2. Cor. 5. Phil. 3. Colo.
3. 1. Theſ. 4. 2. Theſ. 1. 1. Tim. 6. 2. Tim. 4
Titus 2. Heb. 9. Iam. 5. 8. 1. Pet. 1. &amp; 5. cha.
2. Pet. 3. 1. Ioh. 3. 2. Iude 14. Reuel. 1. &amp; 20.
chap. This iudgemēt of Chriſt ſhalbe moſt
iuſt and vpright: &amp; although hee were moſt
falſly iudged and condemned, yet ſhall he
iudge his enemies moſt truely, Iohn 8. frō
whoſe iudgement it ſhall not be lawful for
any man to appeale. Wee knowe, ſaieth
Paul, that the iudgement of God is according
to righteouſnes, Rō. 2. And Abraham
affirmed the like, and ſo did Dauid,
The Lord ſhal iudge his people with equitie.
Although iudges here be corrupt and
faulty, as bribed with giftes, affectioned
with friendes, lead with feare, moued with
fauour, or by any other meanes induced to
peruert iuſtice, yet Chriſtes iudgement
ſhall haue none of all thoſe corruptions
and infirmities. He ſhall haue moſt diuine,
yea, infinite wiſdome, that hee be not deceiued,
not onely to ſee thinges open and
manifeſt, but alſo to iudge and to diſcerne
the very ſecretes and thoughtes of the
heart, as Paul ſayth, Hee will lighten the

things hid in darkeneſſe, and make the
counſels of the heartes manifeſt, 1. Cor. 4.
His ſentence ſhall be ſincere and ſounde,
not partial, inclining more to one part, then
to another, in whome neither the loue of
friendes, nor feare of foes, nor bribery by
giftes and rewardes, ſhal haue any part
or place. For there is no reſpect of perſons
with Chriſt, Roman. 2. Seeing then (beloued)
that this iudgement is ſo ſeuere and
ſtraight, let vs be diligent, that we may be
founde of him in peace without ſpot, and
blameleſſe, as S. Peter doeth counſell vs.
Thus much for ye iudgement it ſelfe, which
was the firſt thing propoſed. Now let vs
come to the ſecond part, to conſider who is
our iudge. It is ſayde, that he ſhall come to
iudge, that is, Chriſt: for to him is al iudgement
committted, &amp; the father doth iudge
in the perſon of his ſonne, Iohn. 5. becauſe
all men ſhoulde honour the ſonne, as they
honour ye father. I neede not to bring many
places for the proofe of this, the ſcriptures
are full of it, that Chriſt is ye ſupreme
iudge, and I hope I neede not to perſwade
men in the doctrine. Let vs rather ſee what
we may gather out of this doctrine, and apply
it to our conſciences, for our conſolation

&amp; cōfort. The vſe of this doctrine, y• Chriſt
is our iudge, is two fold: either in reſpect of
ye wicked, or els as concerning ye good. As
concerning the good, y• Chriſt ſhall be their
only iudge, they cā not but greatly reioyce
&amp; conceiue a wonderful comfort, yt their ſauiour
&amp; brother ſhal be their iudge, who although
he wil not iudge partially, yet ſurely
being a brother &amp; ſauiour, yea ye head of
his body, will iudge moſt mercifully: therefore
our ſauiour biddeth vs, when we ſee
this iudgement drawe neere, to lift vp our
heades and to reioyce, becauſe our redemption
draweth on. For how ſhould we feare,
whē Chriſt wil make vs iudges with him?
as he ſayth, Ye that haue folowed me in ye
regeneratiō, ſhal ſit vpō twelue thrones, &amp;
iudge ye twelue tribes of Iſrael. And Paul
ſayth, Doe ye not know, that ye ſaintes ſhal
iudge the world? Not that we ſhale be iudges
with Chriſt, but yt we ſhal allow &amp; approue
his iudgemēt. For to ſpeak properly,
the elect ſhall not be iudged, but the wicked
ſhall be iudged to euerlaſting fire. This
certainly is no ſmal comfort for weake cō
                     ſciences,
to conſider yt the prince ſhal iudge
his owne people &amp; ſubiectes, the head his

members, &amp; the aduocate his clients. How
then can he condemne thoſe, for whoſe ſafegard
he doth come, &amp; will ratifye y• promiſe
of euerlaſting bliſſe, which he hath promiſed
here in this life by his Goſpel? We ſhal
not thē be cited before any other tribunall
ſeate, thē of our louing bridegrōe, who ſhal
make himſelfe ready to receiue his ſpouſe &amp;
wife, vnto himſelfe for euer. Reuelat. 21.
This day is called the mariage day of the
Lambe, and his ſupper: and his wife ſhall
then be arayed with pure and fine linen and
ſhining, which is ye righteouſnes of ſayntes.
Let vs therefore be glad and reioyce, and
giue glory to him yt ſitteth vpon ye throne.
There can be no day here ſo ioyful as this,
yea al comfort is nothing to this, yt Chriſt
ſhalbe our iudge. He cānot caſt away thē for
whom he hath died: he cannot deny himſelf.
Paul whē he conſidered of this iudge and
iudgemēt, reioyced euē in priſō, yt a crowne
of righteouſnes was laid vp for him, which
the righteous iudge Chriſt Ieſus would
giue vnto him in yt day, 2. Tim. 4. And here
we learne a very good leſſon by the way, yt
if Chriſt be our iudge, we muſt (whē we cā
not haue redreſſe here, or iudgement equally
miniſtred vnto vs) referre our cauſes

and matters of iniurie to him, who is able
to reforme all things, and will at his comming.
So that we muſt not, which are priuate
men, reuenge our owne quarels and
iniuries, but commit them al to him without
murmuring, and hee will iudge them
iuſtly. Then this doth teache vs patience, to
wayte for this comming of Chriſt, to iudge
all thinges orderly. And this good counſayle
did Saint Iames giue in his time to
the poore oppreſſed labourers &amp; huſbandmen,
which were defrauded by ye rich men,
&amp; had their hier and wages kept backe: hee
doeth comfort them in this reſpect, yt Chriſt
wil come to iudge their cauſe, ſaying, Be
patient, brethren, vntill the comming of
the Lord, and ſettle your heartes: for the
comming of our Lorde draweth nere. Yea
and our ſauiour Chriſt ſayde, Luk. 18. that
God will auenge his elect, which cry day
and night vnto him, and that ſhortly.
Whereby we may gather alſo, that the day
of iudgement is not farre off as the wicked
doe ſuppoſe, but draweth on, euery day neerer
then other. Let vs therefore, as our ſauiour
doth counſel vs, watch and pray continually,
that we may be able to ſtand before
him at his comming to iudgemēt. We

ſee then that we muſt commit our cauſes
to Chriſt, &amp; offer our complaintes againſt
the wicked to him, and then doutles with
our eyes we ſhal behold &amp; ſee the reward
of the wicked, Pſal. 91. As this is very
comfortable doctrine to the godly, to heare
that Chriſt is their iudge and auditor of
al their cauſes: ſo is it as doleful and grieuous
a thing to the wicked and caſt awaies,
to wey with themſelues, that Chriſt their enemy
ſhalbe their iudge, whome they haue
alwayes in their life time hated, made a
mocke of, and had in vtter contempt, both
him, his Goſpel, and miniſters of his word
and ſacraments. This ſhall pearce them to
the very heart, to ſee him their iudge, whom
they could neuer abyde: yea his ſight, and
preſence ſhalbe ſo feareful, and terrible vnto
them all, that they ſhall curſe the time,
that euer they were borne: for they ſhal hide
themſelues in dennes, and rockes of the
mountaines, and ſhall ſay to the hilles, Fall
vpon vs, and hide vs from the preſence of
him that ſitteth vpon the throne, and from
the wrath of the Lambe: for the great day
of his wrath is come, and who can ſtande?
Theſe and the like wordes ſhall they vtter
for dolour and anguiſh of minde, and yet

finde no comfort: for they haue refuſed the
Lorde and God of all comfort here vpon
the earth, and therefore ſhall not haue him
there to be their comforter. And S. Iohn
doeth tell vs who theſe are, to whome
this iudge Ieſus ſhalbe ſo fierce and cruel:
euen the kinges of the earth, and the great
men, and the riche men, and the chiefe
captaines, and the mightie men, and euery
bond man, and euery free man,
Reuelation 6. not meaning all kings, and
noble men, but ſome of euery ſtate and
ſorte of men, yea, the greater part of euery
degree of men, eſpecially of great men:
for not many noble, not many wiſe, not
many mightie men are called to the knowledge
of ye Goſpel, leſt they ſhould bragge:
but rather the poore, the baſe, the vnwiſe
are choſen, becauſe they ſhould not vant
of their worthineſſe, as Paul doeth tell vs
in the 1. Corinthians. 1 Chap. moſt notably.
To conclude this part, ſeeing the
Lord ſhal be iudge to the wicked, euen the
Lord Ieſus, to render flaming fire, and
vengeance vnto them that know not God,
and obey not his Goſpel, this may teach
them to feare and to liue ſomewhat more
orderly, if not for the loue of God, of

heauen, and vertue: yet for feare of hell,
death and damnation, to auoyde ye puniſhment
that wil light vpon ſinne at that day.
Let vs come to ye third poynt. The perſōs
that ſhall come before this iudge to be examined
and trìed in iudgement, they are
ſayde here to be the quicke and the dead,
that is to ſay, al, both ye liuing and the dead.
But here ſome may aſke this queſtion,
Seeing it is appointed to al mē once to die,
becauſe they are mortal, how is it ſaid here,
that ſome ſhall be quicke and aliue at
the comming of Chriſt? To this wee
make anſwere, that they that ſhalbe aliue
at the ſecond comming of Chriſt to iudgement
ſhall as it were dye, for they ſhall
all be changed and renewed, and that ſuddenly,
as if they had bene long dead before:
and this is the meaning of Paul, 1
Corinth. 15. Wee ſhal not all dye, that
is, wee ſhall not all be layde in the graue
as others, but we ſhall all be in a moment
altered, which ſhalbe in ſteade of a death
vnto vs. So we ſee what we haue to anſwere
to this queſtion. The perſons then yt
are to be ſūmoned &amp; cited to appeare by ye
voyce of ye Archangel &amp; trūpet of God, in

a woord generally are all men, that euer
haue bene from the firſt man Adam, or ſhalbe
to the laſt man that ſhalbe borne here
vpon the earth. None can eſcape this iudge,
or hide himſelfe away from his ſight, which
ſeeth into the bottome of the ſea, euen into
the middeſt of the earth and hell: none
ſhalbe forgotten, not the leſt childe that is,
for he hath all written in his bookes, both
good and bad, great and ſmall: for theſe are
the wordes of the holy Ghoſt, We muſt all
appeare before the iudgement ſeate of
Chriſt. And againe, As I liue, ſaith the Lord,
euery knee ſhall bowe to me, and euery
tongue confeſſe to me. None then ſhalbe
miſſing: no not the great Monarches, Emperours,
and Kings of the earth ſhall
helpe thēſelues here or flee away, but they
ſhalbe brought to iudgement, and ſtand at
ye barre as others do, &amp; be brought as lowe
as the loweſt. Wel, let vs apply this doctrine
for our vſe, to profit by it. Of this doctrine,
that we muſt al come to iudgement,
and none eſcape, Paul gathereth this argument
and leſſon: that knowing the terrour
of the Lorde, we ſhould doe our duety,
that both dwelling at home and remouing
from home, wee may be acceptable

vnto him. For it made Paul the more roūdlie
to doe his office and function in preaching,
ſaying, We knowing this, perſwade
men, and are made manifeſt vnto God,
and I truſt alſo that we are made manifeſt
vnto your conſciences, 2. Corin. 5. Fourthly,
let vs ſee the maner and order of this generall
iudgement. Our Sauiour Chriſt
doeth moſt liuely deſcribe it in the 25. of
Matthewes Goſpel, ſaying, When the
Sonne of man commeth in his glory, and
all the holy angels with him, then ſhall he
ſit vpon the throne of his glory, and before
him ſhall be gathered all nations, and
he ſhall ſeparate them one from another,
as a ſhephearde ſeparateth the ſheepe
from the goates, and he ſhal ſet the ſheepe
on his right hand, and the goates on his
left: then ſhall the king ſay to them on
his right hand, Come ye bleſſed of my Father,
take the inheritance of the kingdome
prepared for you, from the foundation of
the world: For I was hungry, and ye gaue
me meate, I was thirſtie, and ye gaue mee
drinke, I was a ſtranger, and ye tooke me
in vnto you, I was naked, and ye clothed
me, I was ſicke, and ye viſited me, I was in
priſon, and ye came vnto me, and ſo forth.

Then ſhal he ſay to them on his left hand,
Depart frō mee ye curſed into euerlaſting
fire, which is prepared for the deuill and
his angels: For I was an hungred, and yee
gaue mee no meate, I thirſted, and yee
gaue me no drinke, &amp;c. And theſe ſhall
goe into euerlaſting payne, and the righteous
into life eternall. Here wee ſee the
fourme and order of this iudgement, deſcribed
moſt liuely vnto vs in the perſon of
Chriſt a King, putting ſome on the ryght
hande, and ſome on the left hande. S. Paul
alſo doth ſet it out vnto vs moſt excellētly,
that the Lord Ieſus ſhall deſcend frō heauen
with a ſhoute, and with the voyce of
the Archangel, and Trumpet of God, and
the dead in Chriſt ſhall ryſe firſt, and wee
which remayne aliue, ſhall bee caught vp
with them alſo into the cloudes, to meete
the Lorde in the ayre: and ſo ſhall we bee
euer with the Lorde. Where note, that he

                        •
                     etteth it out onely for the comfort of the
godly, making no mention in this place of
the wicked. Saint Peter ſaith, It ſhall be
as a thiefe in the nyght, in the which the
heauens ſhall paſſe away with a noyſe,
and the elementes ſhall melt with heate,
and the earth with the woorkes that are

therein, ſhalbe burnt vp. 2. Pet. 3. S. Iohn
in the Reuelation doeth very effectually expreſſe
this thing in like maner: for he ſaieth,
that a great white throne was ſet which
he ſaw, and one that ſate vpon it, and the
dead ſtood both great &amp; ſmal before God,
the bookes were opened, ye ſea, and death,
and hel gaue vp their dead, and euery man
was iudged according to the things written
in the bookes, Reuel. 20. Wee learne
this good leſſon by it, as Peter doeth teach
vs, that ſeeing the maner of this great and
laſt day of iudgement by Chriſt, ſhall be ſo
terrible in reſpect of the alteration of the
creatures, wee ought to be holy in all conuerſation
and godlineſſe, looking, and haſting
for the comming of that day of the
Lord Ieſus to iudgement. And here furthermore
wee gather, that heauen and earth
ſhall be diſſolued, and made newe, that this
worlde nowe ſhall haue an ende, as it had a
beginning, contrary to the falſe opinion of
the Philoſophers and wicked Atheiſtes of
our time, which thinke that all things ſhall
continue (as they doe) for euer. Thus much
for the maner of the iudgement. Nowe as
concerning the time, our Sauiour Chriſt
hath forewarned vs, that it is not for vs to

knowe the times and ſeaſons which the
father hath put in his owne power, Act. 1.
For of that daye and houre, knoweth no
man: no not the angels which are in heauen,
neyther the Sonne him ſelfe, but my
Father onely (ſaith Chriſt.) Which is to be
vnderſtoode, that Chriſt knoweth not the
latter day as hee is man, but as he is the eternall
God, and one with his Father, euen
his wiſedome, he knoweth it, and al things
elſe. We ſee then, that the day and houre is
moſt vncertaine, and yet the thing it ſelfe
moſt certaine that it ſhall be. But although
this day and houre be vnknowen, yet notwithſtanding,
our Sauiour Chriſt hath giuen
vs ſignes and tokens of his comming,
which may ſturre vs vp the more warily to
waite for his comming. Theſe things our
Sauiour ſayd ſhoulde come to paſſe before
he came, &amp; we ſee they are fulfilled already:
many ſhall come in his name to deceiue vs,
ſaying, I am Chriſt, &amp; ſhall deceyue many:
we ſhall heare of warres: nation ſhall riſe againſt
nation, realme againſt realme, there
ſhall be famine, earthquakes, and peſtilence
in diuers places: the godly ſhalbe afflicted,
killed, and hated of al men for Chriſts ſake:
many ſhall bee offended at the Goſpel, and

betray one another: the father the ſonne, and
the ſonne the father: the brother againſt the
brother, ſhall riſe, and put him to death: falſe
prophets ſhall aryſe and deceiue many, iniquitie
ſhalbe increaſed, and the loue of many
ſhall bee colde, and the Goſpel ſhall bee
preached vnto all nations, and then ſhall the
end come. Furthermore there ſhalbe ſignes
in the ſunne, and in the moone, and in the
ſtarres: ye ſunne ſhalbe darkened, the moone
ſhall not giue her lyght, and the ſtarres of
heauen ſhall fall: which things haue come to
paſſe, whither you take them litterally, or
allegorically: for both the ſunne and moone
hath beene eclipſed, and ſignes and wonders
haue appeared in the ſtarres, and if ye
take the ſonne for the worde of God and
Goſpel, we ſee it hath bene darkened, and abuſed
by the Papiſtes. The moone which
doth repreſent the Church, which taketh her
light from the ſunne Ieſus Chriſt, hath byn
perſecuted &amp; turned into blood, and not giuen
her light by reaſon of troubles: and the
ſtarres which are likened to the preachers,
haue fallen away, and otherwiſe ſtept aſide.
Theſe things and the lyke may put vs in
minde, that the cōming of Chriſt is not far
off, euen as when we ſee the trees begin to

budde, we know then that the ſpring time is
neere. We know furthermore that the time
of this iudgement ſhalbe very ſudden, as the
lightnings, or as the cōming of a thiefe, and
as the ſudden crying out of a woman with
childe. For as it was in the dayes of ye floud
in Noes time, the waters came and tooke
them all away, ſo ſhall the comming of the
ſonne of man be. Likewiſe alſo, as it was in
the dayes of Lot, they ate, they dranke, they
bought, they ſolde, they planted, they buylt,
they gaue in marriage, and married wiues,
but in ye day that Lot went out of Sodom,
it rayned fire &amp; brimſtone from heauen, and
deſtroyed them all. After theſe enſamples
ſhall it be in the day whē the Sonne of man
is reuealed. And ſurely this day is hid from
our eyes, that we ſhoulde be prepared euery
day, &amp; not be ſecure or careles, to differre repentance,
and put it off from day to day, as a
great many do among vs. Seeing then the
time is at hand, and yet vnknowē, we ought
to be prepared and be in a readines, &amp; to follow
our Maſters counſel: for he ſaith, Take
heed to your ſelues, leaſt at any time your
hearts be oppreſſed with ſurfeting &amp; drunkennes,
and cares of this life, and leaſt that
day come on you at vnwares: for as a ſnare

ſhall it come vpon all them that dwell vpon
the face of the whole earth. Watch
therefore and pray continually, that ye may
be counted worthy to eſcape all theſe things
that ſhall come to paſſe, &amp; that ye may ſtande
before the Sonne of man. This daye is as
the day and time of our death, as we knowe
not when we ſhall die, and yet it is moſt certaine
that we ſhall die: ſo it is with this day.
And whether a man ſhoulde looke for the
day of his death, or this day of iudgement
firſt, truely I can not tell: they are both
ſo vncertaine, neither haue we longer warrant
of time preſcribed vnto vs in the ſcriptures
of the one, then of the other. I praye
God, the Lord Ieſus may finde vs as good
ſeruants, doing his will and woorke at his
comming, that wee may haue our candles
burning in our handes, with oyle in our
lampes, and the marriage garment on our
backes, ready to open the doore, when he cō
                     meth
and knocketh for vs. Happy ſhal we be
if the Lord find vs ſo doing: otherwiſe, if he
finde vs ſmiting our felow ſeruants, eating
and drinking, &amp; being drunken, he ſhal come
vpon vs at vnwares, and cut vs in pieces, &amp;
giue vs our portion with the vnbelieuers &amp;
hypocrites, where ſhalbe weeping and gnaſhing

of teeth. Let vs therefore I beſeeche
you brethren by the Lorde Ieſus, knowing
the time is ſhort and at hande, euen in the
doores, gird vp the loines of our minde, that
when our Sauiour knocketh, we may open
vnto him immediatly. Thus wee ſee what
we haue to note and learne vpon the time of
the comming of Chriſt vnto iudgement.
The place alſo is to be conſidered, the nations
and kinreds of the people that ſhall appeare
that day, are ſo many and innumerable,
that the earth ſhall not bee able to conteyne
them all: therefore Saint Paul ſaith,
that we ſhall be caught vp in the cloudes,
to meete the Lord in the ayre. So that all
ſhall bee taken vp into the ayre as the place
of iudgement. But I come to the laſt poynt
which is more materiall to our purpoſe, for
what ende this great and laſt day is reſerued
and kept in ſtore. It hath two endes or
cauſes, why it is ordayned of the Lorde: the
one is, that the godly may be deliuered out
of their miſeries and troubles, which they
haue here ſtoutly endured for Chriſtes
ſake, and be receyued into euerlaſting life.
The other is, that the wicked &amp; reprobate,
and all the companie of infidels, which haue
herecontemned the Lord, &amp; liued in pleaſure

and delites of the fleſhe, may be iuſtly puniſhed
as they haue well deſerued, with euerlaſting
fire &amp; brimſtone, which is the ſecond
death. For it might ſeeme if there were no
iudgement or life after this, yt the Lord were
notiuſt in his doings: for neither are ye godly
and ryghteous rewarded many times in
this life, neyther are the vngodly puniſhed
for their offences while they liue here, for
the moſt part. Now God is moſt iuſt, which
will rewarde all godlines and vertue, and
ſeuerely puniſh vice and wickednes. Theſe
two endes, doth our Sauiour mention in
the general iudgement: the one ſort ſaith he,
ſhall goe into euerlaſting life, and the other
ſort into euerlaſting fire, Matth. 25.
Saint Paul likewiſe doth make mention of
theſe cauſes, in the ſecond epiſt. of the Theſſalonians,
the firſt chapter, ſhewing as well
what the good ſhall haue, as the bad, ſaying
on this wiſe, It is a righteous thing with
God, to recompenſe tribulation to them
that trouble you, and to you which are
troubled, reſt with vs, when the Lord Ieſus
ſhall ſhewe him ſelfe from heauen with
his mighty angels in flaming fire, rendring
vengeance vnto them that do not knowe
GOD, and which obey not the Goſpel of

our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, which ſhalbe puniſhed
with euerlaſting perdition from the
preſence of the Lord, and from the glorie
of his power: thus much for the wicked.
Now foloweth rewarde for the good, when
hee ſhall come the bee glorified in his ſaintes,
and to bee made marueylous in all them
that beleeue in that day. Here wee may haue
a notable diſcourſe, as is in any place of
ſcripture, why our ſauiour Chriſt ſhal come
to iudgement, both in reſpect of the good
and bad: yea, the wicked angels and ſpirites
them ſelues, as Iude ſaith, hee hath reſerued
in euerlaſting chaines of darkeneſſe,
vnto the iudgement of the great day. This
day is greatly deſired and longed for of the
godly, and eſpecially of the true miniſters
of Chriſtes Goſpell, that their cauſe may
bee knowen to bee good agaynſt the
wicked, and their ſayings veryfied concerning
this iudgement: for ſurely there is nothing
almoſt ſeene of God, or beleeued of
the wicked vntyll that day. Tell them of
this day, and terrifie them with it, they make
a mocke at it, they count them for fooles and
ſimple perſons, that liue a godly and Chriſtian
life: but when this day commeth, (as
it will come certainly) it will make a recompence

for all, and they ſhall finde all
our ſayings &amp; threatnings to be moſt true.
Therefore the godly deſire it in reſpect of
Gods glorie chiefly, which the wicked haue
defaced. A great many of them thinke that
there is neyther hell nor heauen, God nor
Deuill, and that all are but fables that wee
ſpeake of this day, and ſo they growe to an
vtter contempt of God and all godlines.
But (as the Lord liueth) they ſhall finde
it true by experience, which they woulde
not here embrace by fayth: yea, they ſhall
confeſſe themſelues ſtarke fooles, and the
godlie men to bee wiſe in deede, Wiſedome
5. Chriſt Ieſus ſhall bee that great Lorde
and riche maſter of the houſe, which ſhall
come to take an account of his ſeruantes talentes
giuen vnto them to encreaſe and vſe
to his honour and glory, and to the good
and diligent ſeruauntes ſhall hee giue rewardes
and ioy, but to the vnprofitable ſeruauntes,
ſtripes and paine eternall. This
ſhalbe the newe married bridegrome and
huſbande, which ſhall come to make a choiſe
of the wiſe and chaſte virgins, which haue
kept them ſelues pure vnto him, from the
fooliſhe and vnchaſte, which haue defyled
them ſelues with the wicked worlde.

In that day Chriſt ſhalbe that good and diligent
huſbandman, which ſhal come to gather
the wheate in the time of harueſt into his
barnes for his owne vſe, but ſhall burne
the chaffe with vnquenchable fire. And to
conclude, hee ſhall be that great ſhepheard
which ſhall diuide the lambes and ſheepe
from the goates, the one to ſitte on his right
hande in ioy, the other to ſitte on his lift
hande in ſorowe: to this ende no doubt ſhall
our ſauiour Chriſte come, and then ſhall it
be ſaide, O happie and thriſe happie was
hee that was a faithfull ſeruant, a chaſte virgin
to Chriſt, the good corne, the meeke
lambe of Ieſus Chriſt. But this of the wicked
ſpoken, then ſhalbe too late, and repentance
at that time ſhalbe in vayne. I counſell
all men therefore that will not there
repent that euer they were borne, as the wicked
ſhall doe, that they woulde in the name
of Ieſus Chriſte, repent here betime, and
aſke the ſpirite of the Lord to amende their
liues, that they put not off from day to day,
vntill they are olde, or haue all thinges as
they woulde. The Lorde will come ſuddenly
vpon ſuch an one, taking him away in
his ſinne. If wee woulde lay the remembraunce
of this iudgement day often before

our eyes, to ſturre vp our ſelues withall,
and to awaken our dull ſpirites and
ſenſes, it woulde keepe vs in great feare
and awe before our Lorde GOD,
and drawe vs from much ſinne and abomination,
which nowe for lacke of thinking
vpon this day, is committed euery where,
both at home and abroade, as well in the
countrey and baſe mens houſes, as in the
court and great mens places. Well, wee
ſhoulde doe as a godly father did in the primitiue
Church, that whether wee eate or
drynke, whether wee ſleepe or wake, or
whatſoeuer wee doe, wee ſhoulde thinke alwayes
this day to be at hande, and the voyce
ſounding in our cares, ariſe yee dead and
come to iudgement. Notable of al others,
is that leſſon that Solomon doth giue vnto
vs in the booke of the preacher, the 11 and
laſt Chapters, concerning this matter: hee
mocketh and derideth them that delite in
ſinne, as you ſee men commonly doe, and
afterwarde threatneth and terrifieth them
with this laſt iudgement, ſaying, Reioyce
O young man in thy youth, and let thyne
heart cheare thee in the daies of thy youth,
and walke in the wayes of thy heart, and in
the ſight of thine eies: Marke now what ſosowre

ſauce foloweth this ſweet meate: but
knowe, ſayth hee, that for all theſe thinges,
GOD will bring thee to iudgement: for
God wil bring euery work into iudgemēt,
&amp; euery ſecret thing, whether it be good or
euill. A notable glaſſe for all men to looke
vpon, is this finall iudgement. Wee are
taught by theſe thinges, that our felicitie
and pleaſure conſiſteth not in this life, neyther
can we haue it here, but it is in the lyfe
to come layde vp for vs in Chriſt. Here are
confuted all worldlings, which thinke there
is no other lyfe after this, no ioy or payne.
This day can not bee fearefull to the godly,
for it is called our bleſſed hope, Titus. 2.
and the godly doe loue it, 2. Timothie 4.
If it bee fearefull and terrible to any, as it
is, it is to thoſe that haue no hope of heauen,
and to thoſe that put their whole pleaſure
and felicitie here belowe in their money
and ill gotten ryches. To the fearefull
and vnbeleeuyng, and the abominable, and
murderers, and whoremongers, and ſorcerers,
and idolaters, and lyers, and couetous
perſons, this day ſhall bee fearefull
and terrible: yea, it ſhall make them all
to quake for feare, for they ſhall haue their
part in the lake that burneth with fyre
and brymſtone, which is the ſeconde death,

Reuelation 21. This day and the cogitation
thereof, ſerueth moſt fitly, to put men
in mynde of their dueties and callyngs
before the Lorde, for ſo our Sauiour
Chriſte applied it in his tyme in his Goſpell,
ſaying to them that were worldely
mynded, What ſhall it profite a man,
though he ſhould win the whole worlde,
if he loſe his owne ſoule, or what ſhall a
mā giue for recompēce of his ſoule? marke
his reaſon, why it is dangerous, thus to hazarde
and venture his ſoule: for, ſaith he, the
ſonne of man ſhal come in the glory of his
father with his angels, and then ſhall hee
giue to euery man according to his deedes,
Mat. 16. ſo doth Paul charge Timo. eſpecially
by this iudgement day, ſaying, I charge
thee before God, &amp; before the Lord Ieſus
Chriſt, which ſhall iudge the quicke
and the dead at his appearing, and in his
kingdome, Preach the worde, be inſtant,
in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, improoue,
rebuke, exhort with al long ſuffering and
doctrine, 2. Timothie 4. As if hee ſhoulde
ſay in effect, There is a day of iudgement
kept in ſtore, therefore doe thy duetie
diligently. This day of iudgement
ſhall make vs very carefull to ſhewe

foorth all good woorkes: For Chriſt ſhall
pronounce the definitiue ſentence vpon all
men according to their workes, not that the
godly haue deſerued or merited heauen by
their good workes, that is too great a thing
to bee gotten by woorkes: for Chriſt hath
already deſerued that for vs by his good
workes, if wee beleeue in him. But Chriſt
ſhall make mention of woorkes, to ſhewe
and to ſignifie to all the worlde, that the
godly haue not beene idle or vnfruitfull in
this life, as the hypocrites are, whoſe ſheepe
ſkinnes then ſhall be plucked off, and then
ſhall they appeare to bee rauening wolues:
for this cauſe ſhall the iudgement bee according
to workes, to ſturre men vp here, while
they heare this, to good works, and to make
manifeſt to al men, that the godly haue walked
innocently, and that the wicked haue
followed the luſts of the fleſh. Our faith can
not be ſeene, and therfore Chriſt ſhal ſpeake
according to the effect and conſequent of it,
which is ſeene, and that is good woorkes.
Chriſt before ſheweth the cauſe of heauen
for y• elect, not their works, but becauſe they
were bleſſed of his father, and that the kingdome
was prepared for thē before they were
borne, or did any good workes for it, yea,

before the fundations of the worlde were
layde, as Paul Epheſ. 1, ſheweth moſt notably.
Wherefore good Chriſtians, flee the
corruption which is in the worlde, and giue
great diligence to bring forth good works,
for thoſe are good and profitable vnto mē,
and ſo ye ſhall be knowen to bee good and
fruitfull trees. Ioyne moreouer vertue
with your faith, &amp; with vertue, knowledge,
with knowledge, tēperance, with tēperāce,
patience, with patience, godlines, with godlines,
brotherly kindneſſe, &amp; with brotherly
kindnes, loue. For if theſe things be amōg
you, and aboūde, they wil make you that ye
neither ſhall be idle, nor vnfruitfull in ye acknowledging
of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt:
and he that hath not theſe things, is blinde,
and can not ſee a farre off, and hath forgotten
that he was purged frō his olde ſinnes.
Giue therefore diligence to make your calling
and election ſure, for if ye doe theſe
things, ye ſhal neuer fal: for by this meanes
an entring ſhall be miniſtred vnto you abundantly
into the euerlaſting kingdome
of our Lord and ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt. We
haue heard nowe the ſixe articles that appertaine
to the perſon of Ieſus Chriſt, and
conteine the benefites he hath wrought for

vs, wherein is our whole ſaluation. For if
we ſeeke ſaluation, his name Ieſus, doeth
ſhewe it is in him alone. If we deſire puritie,
it is in his conception. If we require a
kinde of familiaritie and gentlenes, wherewith
he hath made him ſelfe like vnto vs,
we ſhall haue it in his natiuitie. Wouldeſt
thou haue redemptiō for thy ſinnes? looke
it in his paſſion and death. If newnes of
life, thou haſt it in his reſurrection. If inheritance
of the heauenly kingdome, it is in
his aſcenſion. If thou aſkeſt a full poſſeſſion
of it, thou ſhalt haue it when hee
commeth to iudgement. To be briefe, If
thou deſireſt the giftes of the holy ghoſt,
abſolution, remiſſion of ſinnes, ſatiſfaction,
and purgation for thy vnclennes, reconciliation,
mortification of the fleſh, and at a
worde, all treaſures of euery heauēly gift,
thou haſt them all in Ieſus Chriſt, as in a
well euer ſpringing, and a fountaine that
is neuer drie. Of whoſe fulnes thou and all
men haue receiued, and he is made of God
the father vnto thee, wiſedome, righteouſneſſe,
holineſſe, and redemption, that thou
ſhouldeſt glorie in him alone▪ Take heede
therefore, that ſeeing he is all in all to thee,
that thou goe not from him to any other,

or aſcribe any one part or portion, neuer ſo
litle, of thy ſaluation to any creature whatſoeuer.
For if thou doe, thou marreſt all, &amp;
Ieſus Chriſt will haue all or neuer a whit,
as Eſaie ſayeth, I will not giue my glorie
to an other. Well, to conclude this
article, let vs giue to Ieſus Chriſt moſt
humble and heartie thanks, that he wil one
day come downe from heauen, to fetche vs
vp thither vnto him, to immortall bleſſedneſſe:
and let vs in the meane time deſire of
him the ſpirit of patience, to wayte for his
comming to iudgement, for our full redemption,
that we may haue our oyle, our
garmentes, and our lampes ready, that we
may be waking when he ſhall knocke, and
open the doore forthwith vnto him, that in
ſo doing, we may enter in with him to the
mariage, &amp; there raigne perpetually with
him in the glorie of his father. Which he
graūt vnto vs for his ſonnes ſake, to whom
with the holy ghoſt, three perſons, and one
immortall God in vnitie, bee rendred all
prayſe, glorie, and giuing of thankes, from
this time forth, for euer more. Come Lord
Ieſus quickly, Amen, ſo be it.
               
               
                  
                  The eight Lecture vpon
the eight article of our Chriſtian
fayth:
                  I beleeue in the holy Ghoſt.
                  
                     HAuing ended two partes of our
Chriſtian faith, ye one cōcerning
God the father in the firſt article,
the other concerning Ieſus
Chriſt, the ſecond perſon in trinitie, conteined
in the ſixe articles folowing: nowe
foloweth in order ye third part, concerning
our faith in God ye holy Ghoſt, which is the
third perſon in trinitie. And this is ye eight
article of our beliefe: I beleeue in the holy
Ghoſt, that is to ſay, I that am a Chriſtian
man, do beleeue and truſt in God the holy
ghoſt, the third perſon in the bleſſed trinitie,
which proceedeth equally from the father
and the ſonne, being the naturall &amp; eſſentiall
power of them both, &amp; of the ſame
ſubſtance. Which ſpirite ſanctifieth &amp; comforteth
me in all troubles, and aſſureth me
that I am the childe of God, and ſeruant of
Ieſus Chriſt, and ſhall haue his benefites
plentifully powred vpō me. Out of this article
we learne two things, firſt, what is the

holy ghoſt, ſecondly, what are his effects &amp;
workes, as well in it ſelfe, as in man, in
whoſe heart it worketh, and moueth him
forward to that which is good, to imbrace
and followe it with all earneſtnes, but to
hate and abhorre from the heart, that which
is naught and wicked. This holy ghoſt or
ſpirit, is the euerlaſting power and infinite
might of God the father, which ſpirite is
no creature but a creator of all things, and
very God, becauſe we are here taught to
beleue in him, which ſuerly except he were
very God, were idolatrie to do: for we muſt
not beleue in any creature, or put our truſt
in any, but in God onely. And that the holy
ghoſt is God, which certaine heretikes
haue denied, it is manifeſt in the fift chapter
of the Actes of the Apoſtles, where
ſaint Peter ſpeaking of the holy ghoſt, nameth
him God. For he reprehendeth Ananias
and Sapphira his wife, for their hypocriſy
and diſſimulation, and telleth them
that they lyed vnto the holy ghoſt, and immediatly
after ſayth, that they lyed not
vnto man, but vnto God. In the firſt
of Geneſis, it is ſayde, that the ſpirite of
the Lorde moued vpon the waters. This
was the third perſon in trinitie, which except

he had bene God, could not haue ſo
moued vpon this great depth, and ſecretly
by his power and maieſtie, preſerued and
maintained it from falling to nothing.
Dauid ſaieth, All things were made and
created by the breath of his mouth. Therfore
if he made al things, he was very God.
For this is proper to God alone, to make &amp;
to create things. That argument of Paul
in the 1. Cor. 2. chap. doth ſufficiētly proue
this matter vnto vs, where hee ſaieth, that
this ſpirit ſearcheth al things, yea ye deepe
things of God, and that no man knoweth
the things of God, but the ſpirit of God.
Now if ye ſpirit of God knoweth al things,
ſearcheth al things, thē is he very God, for
no creature doth this. If this be ſo, thē we
rightly beleeue in the holy ghoſt, &amp; here we
gather this ſingular comfort, that we may
pray to this holy ghoſt at all times for his
helpe, &amp; to impart ſome of his knowledge
vnto vs, becauſe he hath all knowledge and
vnderſtanding. This is ye doctrine that we
gather generally of this, yt the holy ghoſt is
true &amp; very God. For verily, except he were
God, Chriſt would not cōmaunde his diſciples
to baptiſe in the name of the holy
ghoſt, putting him in equall condition and

eſtate with the father, and him ſelfe: Not
that we affirme that there be three Gods,
but this we meane: In the one and inſeparable
diuine nature and eſſence of God, we
vnderſtand three perſons by them ſelues,
diſtinct one frō another. But this miſtery
of the trinitie, may better be beleeued (and
ſo it is of ye faithfull) then fitly expreſſed of
any. I leaue it therefore, to ſpeake any further
of it vntill in the reſurrection, we ſhall
ſee it as it is, and perceiue that by ſight, euē
face to face, which nowe wee conceiue by
our fayth onely. Thus much of the holy
ghoſt, the third perſon in this trinitie. Now
let vs conſider the wonderfull effectes of
it, which is a thing more profitable for vs.
The effectes of the holy ghoſt, are of two
ſortes: eyther as they are conſidered in
him ſelfe, or as they are in the children of
God: the effects of the holy ghoſt in him
ſelfe, are the creation of the worlde, the preſeruation
of it with al things therein, from
the beginning vnto this day. Wherein we
learne to giue thākes to this holy ſpirit, for
his goodnes extended vnto vs, &amp; to pray to
him cōtinually to mainteine vs by his power
&amp; vertue, yt we fall not away from him.
                  
                     
For if hee take away his ſtrength and
operation from vs, wee are as blynde men
groping for the waye. And this is that, that
Dauid ſpeaketh of in his Pſalme 104. If
thou hide thy face, they are troubled, meaning,
all his creatures. Agayne, If thou
ſende foorth thy ſpirite, they are created,
and thou renueſt the face of the earth. But
our purpoſe is eſpecially to ſpeake here of
thoſe good giftes and effectes, which this
holy ſpirite doeth worke in men, chiefly in
the elect. For there is no man, but hath
had ſome good gifte at one time, or an other,
either in body or in ſoule, from this
holy ſpirit. For ſtrength, beauty, learning,
eloquence, witte, knowledge, vtterance, policie,
the gift of healing, of tongues, of miracles,
and ſuch like, are from aboue, although
theſe are common, as well to the
ill and reprobate, as to the good and elect
ſonnes of God, as Paul doth ſhewe, and
declare more at large in the 12. 13. &amp; 18.
chapters of the 1. Corinthians. Our meaning
is to ſpeake chiefly of the graces of
Gods ſpirite in the hearts of his choſen,
as of fayth, hope, and loue vnfayned, of the
ſpirit of ſanctification and adoption, which
are proper only to the elect and good, &amp; are

neuer cōmunicated to the wicked. Of this
ſpirit ſpake our ſauiour Chriſt to his diſciples,
that he would ſende him vpon them,
and that the world could not receyue him.
This is that ſpirit, by whome the father
doeth place, and put the elect in ful poſſeſſion
of all the goodes and inheritance of Ieſus
Chriſt, and doeth keepe and preſerue
vs euery houre, and doeth make vs partakers
of all thinges neceſſary to ſaluation,
which thing it bringeth to paſſe, when as it
doeth create in our heartes and beget yt excellent
inſtrument of faith, ye chiefeſt worke
of ye ſpirit, which bringeth foorth as a moſt
fruitefull tree, all other good fruites and
workes of a Chriſtiā man. This faith doth
ye holy ghoſt ingender in our heartes, when
we heare the Goſpel of Chriſt preached: &amp;
it is confirmed &amp; encreaſed in vs, by ye duely
and reuerent receiuing of the ſacraments
of Chriſt. By this faith (after it is wrought
in vs by the motion and operation of
the holy ſpirite, wee apprehend and take
holde of all Chriſtes benefites, merites,
works, and good deedes whatſoeuer, and
they are made &amp; accounted ours, as if wee
had done them our ſelues. O wonderfull
gift of ye holy ghoſt, yt worketh ſo precious a

iewel &amp; pearle in our heartes, as farre ſurmoſiteth
ye price &amp; valew of euery thing beſide!
This is ye firſt effect of ye holy ghoſt, &amp;
is marueilous in our eies. An other property,
&amp; effect of this holy ſpirit, is ſanctification
&amp; holines of life, in ye good &amp; godly only,
&amp; therfore he is called ye holy ſpirit, for this
worke of holines in vs. For as it is proper
to ye father to create, to ye ſonne to redeeme
and rāſome: ſo in like ſort it is proper and
peculiar to ye holy Ghoſt, to ſanctifie Gods
childrē, &amp; effectually to moue their mindes
to true holineſſe. And of this effect doth S.
Paul ſpeake in the 1. Cor. 6. ſhewing the
Corinthians that they were wicked men,
as fornicatours, idolatours, extortioners,
couetous, theeues &amp; ſuch like, but (ſaith he)
you are waſhed, but you are ſāctified, but
ye are iuſtified in the name of the Lorde
Ieſus, and by the ſpirite of our God. As
if we would ſay, thoſe good graces &amp; gifts
of God were wrought &amp; imprinted in their
conſciences &amp; hearts, by the perſuaſion of ye
holy ghoſt. Neceſſarily therfore, after our
beleefe in ye father, &amp; ye ſonne, followeth our
beleefe in ye holy ghoſt: For whatſoeuer cō
                     meth
frō thē, as all graces do, they are ſigned
&amp; ſealed vnto vs, by ye warrāt of ye holy
ghoſt. Wherefore, it is fitly compared to a

ſeale, whereby al ye promiſes of ye bleſſings
of God through Chriſt, are deepely ingrauen
in our hearts, yt they cā neuer thēce be
raſed out any more, but ſhal cōtinue for euer.
As we ſee the writing to be to no effect,
without a mans hand &amp; ſeale, no more are
ye graces of God vnto vs, to any purpoſe,
vnleſſe he ſēd ye earneſt of his ſpirit into our
hearts, which doth cōfirme thē vnto vs, and
aſſertaine our cōſciences, ye we are his childrē,
&amp; he our father, Rom. 8. This is a notable
effect, &amp; is in ſuch ſort taſted of ye godly,
&amp; approued of thē, as neither ye wiſedōe of yt
world, nor ye ſenſe &amp; vnderſtāding of man is
able to cōprehend, neither cā yet be perceiued
by ye eyes of mē: for theſe things are ſpiritually
iudged &amp; diſcerned, &amp; therefore no
maruel, if godly mē hauing ye ſpirit of God,
and ſpeaking therewith, are mocked and
derided of the carnall men in this worlde,
which haue him not, neither can iudge any
thing of him, 1. Cor. 2. This ſpirit although
it be one &amp; ye ſame, &amp; not many, or deuide,
1. Cor. 12. Epheſ. 4: yet in reſpect of ye
diuers &amp; ſundry effects &amp; operatiōs of him
in ye church of Chriſt, hee is called &amp; termed
by ye name of ſeuē ſpirits, yt is, of many,
for his manifold gifts. As in ye fourth of ye
Reuelat, it is ſaid, There were ſeuē lāpes of

fire burning before the throne, which are
ye ſeuen ſpirites of God: that is, a ſeuen fold
ſpirit of God. This ſpirit is called, A ſpirit
of wiſedome and vnderſtāding, a ſpirit of
ſtrength and counſell, and the ſpirit of the
feare of the Lord, becauſe it giueth al theſe
qualityes vnto men, and doeth teache vs, ye
what good gift ſoeuer we haue, we haue it
frō ye holy ghoſt, the giuer of al, and whatſoeuer
we lacke, we ſhould ſeeke it likewiſe
of the ſame ſpirit, &amp; none other. The holy
Apoſtle, rekoning vp the diuerſities of the
giftes of the holy ſpirit, affirmeth alwayes,
That it is one and the ſelfe ſame ſpirit, that
giueth theſe things, as ye gift of wiſedome,
of knowledge, of faith, of healing, of miracles,
of prophecie, of diſcerning ſpirites,
of tongues, of interpretation of tongues: al
theſe thinges (ſayethe he) worketh one and
the ſame ſpirit, diſtributing to euery man
ſeuerally as he wil, 1. Cor. 12. This doeth
alſo teache vs, that this ſpirit hath moſt
plentifull ſtore of giftes, to enriche the body
of the Church of Chriſt, and that there
is no want or lacke in him. A great cōfort
vnto vs to knowe, whither to reſort incōtinently
for any good gifte, &amp; to haue it forthwith:
For Chriſt hath promiſed this holy

ſpirit to them that ſeeke, aſke and knock
for it, Luke. 11. Doeſt thou feele thy ſelfe
to lacke fayth, or hope, or loue, or ſanctification
of life, or any good and neceſſary gift
to edifte Gods Church withall? Pray to
this holy ſpirit, &amp; vſe the ordinarie meanes
he willeth thee, as hearing the word, prayer,
labour and ſtudy, and this ſpirite ſhalbe
giuen thee. This ſpirit was ſo neceſſary, yt
our ſauiour promiſed to ſend it aboue all
things to his diſciples, to comfort them wt,
when he departed from them. For he breathed
vpon them, and ſaid, Receiue yee the
holy ghoſt, Ioh. 20. And afterwarde ſent it
downe more plentifully vpon them, in the
likenes of fire and clouen tongues, Act. 2.
Wher with they were not a little cōforted
in their miſeries &amp; troubles againſt their
aduerſaries, which were not able to reſiſt
them, ſpeaking with this holy ſpirite, Act.
6. This ſpirit is ſayd to haue diuers names
&amp; appellations in ye ſcriptures, to comfort
vs withal in tētations. He is called the ſpirit
of trueth, to teache vs the trueth, and to
leade vs into all trueth. He is called alſo ye
cōforter, becauſe he dothrefreſh &amp; cōfort our
hearts nothing more, thē in tētations &amp; aduerſities,
as Paul found it true, in ye 2. Cor.

1. Cap. he is called ye 
                     power of God, becauſe
he worketh al things, &amp; nothing is vnpoſſible
vnto him: ſōetime he is named ye 
                     autor of
light, becauſe he doth illuminate, &amp; enlightē
our darke &amp; blind hearts, wt the bright ſunbeāes
of his wil &amp; pleaſure. Briefely, he is ye
wel &amp; foūtaine of al goodneſſe, whereat we
muſt draw al things needeful for vs in this
life. This being ſo, it ſtādeth vpō euery one
of vs, to labour by all meanes poſſible,
to haue this ſpirit dwelling, &amp; abiding with
vs for euer. For ſurely ye neceſſitie of him is
great, &amp; the vſe of him aboue moſt precious
gold, ſiluer, &amp; pearls, Pſal. 19. Dauid
vnderſtoode this right wel to be ſo, for hee
prayeth that God woulde not take away
his ſpirite from him, but ſtabliſh him with
his free ſpirit, Pſal. 50. For where ye ſpirit of
the Lord is, there is libertie and freedome
from the ſeruice of ye deuill, &amp; from ye ſlauery
of ſin. We are by nature, al of vs ye children
of wrath &amp; damnatiō, earthly minded,
&amp; alwayes groueling to ye ground, being ouerloden
&amp; burdened wt the weight of our
ſinnes, except we be rayſed &amp; lifted vp by
this ſpirit, euē as ye ſoule maintaineth &amp; vpholdeth
ye weake &amp; brittle body. It cōmeth
to paſſe then in vs, no otherwiſe, thē we ſee

it by experience in bladders, ye which, if they
be empty, &amp; caſt into ye waters, for ye weight
of thē, they ſinke foorthwith, &amp; are drowned.
But if they be blowen, &amp; filled wt wind,
wherewith they be made light, they flyt aboue
ye water, &amp; ſwim. Euē ſo it fareth wt vs:
How heauie we are wt ſin, our cōſciences (if
we examine thē wel) wil tel vs. Wherefore
we cānot but ſinke, being toſſed in ye waues
of ye ſea of this world, &amp; drowned with ye inordinate
deſires, paſſiōs, &amp; affectiōs of this
life, being altogether voyde of this ſpirite,
which ſhould beare vs vp frō theſe ſurges &amp;
tēpeſts of this life. But now if we be filled &amp;
repleniſhed wt this heauenly ſpirit, thē ſhall
we ſwim aboue, &amp; triumph ouer ſin &amp; wickedneſſe,
&amp; not be drowned wt it. Wherfore
Paul wel weying wt himſelfe this dāger, if
we were deſtitute of ye holy ghoſt, willeth
vs yt we ſhould not be drūke wt wine, wherin
is exceſſe, &amp; which maketh vs ſo heauie
&amp; drowſie, yt we ſinke: but ſaith, yt 
                     ſhould
be filled with ye ſpirit, which cauſeth vs to
mount vp to heauē. Therefore is it, yt he ſo
oftē times cōmādeth vs to walke in ye ſpirit,
&amp; to do ye works of ye ſpirite, which are loue,
ioy, peace, long ſuffering, gētlenes, goodneſſe,
faith, meekenes, tēperāce. We are wt out

this ſpirit, as a ſhip in the ſea without a
gouernour, or as a mā without his eyes, in
moſt dangerous caſe: for tell me, I pray
you, what is the cauſe why ſo many now a
dayes run headlong to all wickedneſſe &amp; abominatiōs?
ſome to whoredōe, ſome to couetouſnes,
ſome to drūkēnes, ſome to pride,
ſome to theft &amp; robberies, ſome to one ſin,
&amp; ſome to another? what is the reaſō, I ſay,
but only this, becauſe God hath not giuē his
holy ſpirit vnto thē, to defēd thē frō theſe euils
&amp; miſchiefs? And this cauſe doth S. Iude
render in his Epiſtle, for hauing rekoned vp
the natural properties &amp; conditions of the
wicked &amp; reprobate, namely, that they were
deſpiſers of gouernment &amp; autoryty, (as ye
Anabaptiſtes are) defilers of ye fleſhe, liuing
in pleaſure, murmurers, complayners, walking
after their owne luſts, ſpeaking proud
things, flatterers &amp; ſuch like. In ye end hee
addeth this, as ye cauſe &amp; mother of al theſe
ſinnes, the not hauing of ye ſpirit, meaning
in deede, yt becauſe God hath not giuen thē
his holy ſpirit, therfore they were ſuch kind
of mē, as he there painteth forth in their colours,
&amp; ſuch as we dayly ſe here wt vs. And
yet for al this, God is not boūd to any man
to giue him his ſpirit, as Paul proueth

                     Rō. 11. neither do they humble thēſelues to
aſke his grace by earneſt &amp; hearty praier, for
thē ſhould they haue it, Iam. 1. By the lacke
and want of this ſpirite in other men, wee
may eaſily ſee what a benefite we haue by
him, to keepe and defende vs ſo mercifully
euery houre, in all our waies and actions of
our life. If this ſpirit leaue vs neuer ſo litle
while to our ſelues, then we fal into an hundred
miſchāces and euils, as we ſee in Moſes
a ſingular man, being left to his owne
will and choyſe but a litle, he fell twiſe together
to doubt and diſtruſt of the power of
the Lorde, whether he were able to doe all
thinges or no, as to bring water out of the
rocke, and to feede the Iſraelites with fleſh,
being ſixe hundred thouſand men, for a moneths
ſpace, Numb. 11. &amp; 20. So Dauid,
being not vpholden with this ſpirit, and left
to his owne will, fell by and by to adulterie
and murther. We had neede therefore to
pray continually to Ieſus Chriſt, the giuer
of this ſpirite, that we may haue him with
vs to direct our liues, &amp; make them acceptable
before the Lord. This ſpirit for diuers
other effects that it hath, is compared in the
Scriptures to water, to oyle, to fire, to
winde, to a doue. To water it is likened

both in the newe and olde Teſtament, as in
Eſa. 44. where the Lord ſayth, I wil powre
water vpon the thirſtie, and floods vpon
the dry grounde. And what he meaneth by
this water and dry grounde, he afterwarde
expoundeth in the ende of the verſe, ſaying,
I will powre my ſpirit vpon thy ſeede, and
my bleſſing vpon thy buddes. In the newe
Teſtament our Sauiour ſayth, If any man
thirſt, let him come vnto me and drinke:
he that beleeueth in me, as ſayth the Scripture,
out of his belly ſhall flowe riuers of
waters of life. And that he meant this of the
ſpirit, Iohn immediately declareth, ſaying,
This ſpake he of the ſpirit, which they that
beleeued in him, ſhould receiue, Iohn 7. As
water therfore doeth cleanſe and purifie the
filthie and vncleane in bodie being waſhed
with it, &amp; is very neceſſary for our life here:
ſo doeth this holy ſpirit of God much more
clēſe &amp; purifie our ſoules frō the infection &amp;
filthines of ſinne, as Ezechiel fitly applieth
it: I will powre cleane water vpon you, &amp;
ye ſhall be cleane, yea from all your filthines,
&amp; from al your idoles wil I clenſe you.
And ſo by and by ſayth, I will put my ſpirit
within you, Ezech. 36. Of this pure water
ſpeaketh the Apoſtle to the Hebr. 10. chap.

This ſpirit is moreouer likened to oyle, for
the ſupplenes &amp; gentlenes that is in it, &amp; in
thē that haue it, Pſal. 45. To fire alſo is this
ſpirit compared, as we reade in Matth. 3. &amp;
Act. 2. For Chriſt ſhal baptize with fire, as
Iohn ſaith: which is ye holy Ghoſt. For euen
as fire doeth conſume, ſcoure, purge &amp; giue
light: ſo no doubt doeth the holy ſpirite of
God conſume the wicked, ſcoure our filth,
purge our ſinnes, &amp; inlighten our ignorant
hearts, as Paul ſaith, Ariſe thou that ſleepeſt,
&amp; Chriſt ſhal giue thee light, Ephe. 5.
Lift thou vp the light of thy coūtenāce vpō
vs, Pſal. 4. Thirdly it is cōpared to a great &amp;
mighty winde, Act. 2. For as windes doe
purge &amp; make wholſome ye aire from his infectiō
&amp; cōtagiouſnes: ſo doth ye ſpirit work
in the hearts of his, this purging from their
old corruption &amp; cōtagion of ſinne by Adā,
and regenerateth and renueth vs againe by
the immortall ſeede of the worde, 1. Pet. 2.
whereby we are borne anewe, that we may
enter into the kingdome of heauen, Ioh. 3.
The ſpirite of God is alſo likened vnto a
winde in this reſpect: yt as nothing is able
to reſiſt or withſtand ye force of great whirlwindes,
but they beare down before them euery
thing that ſtādeth againſt thē, whether

it be trees, houſes, caſtels or towres: ſo it is
with the ſpirit of God, whom no creature is
able to withſtande or reſiſt, but muſt needes
fall vnder it, and which deſtroyeth euery hie
thing, which is exalted againſt the knowledge
of God, caſting downe ſtrong holdes,
and the imaginations of mighty Princes, &amp;
bringeth into captiuitie euery thought to
the obedience of Chriſt, and hath ready vengeance
againſt all diſobedience. This thing
may be cōfirmed by diuers examples, eſpecially
by that of the enchaunters and ſorcerers
of Egypt, when they were compelled
to ſaye, that this was the finger of God, to
bring lyce out of the duſt, &amp; that they coulde
not doe the like: the ſpirite of God ſo confounded
their wiſdome and ſorcerie, Exo. 8.
Other mo examples might be brought, but
I paſſe them ouer, and leaue them to the diligent
readers of the ſcriptures, where they
ſhall finde ſtore of them. Fourthly this holy
ſpirite is likened to a doue, as we reade of
in the 3. of Matthewe, deſcending downe
from heauen, &amp; lighting vpon our ſauiour.
He is compared to a doue, for theſe qualities
and properties, which are meekeneſſe
and gentleneſſe: for this ſpirite doeth cauſe
them to put off anger and wrath, in whome

it abideth, and to vſe brotherly kindenes one
to another. And the doue is ſayd to be without
gall, and very chaſte: ſo is this ſpirite
without all bitternes in the heartes of them
whome it doeth poſſeſſe, and teacheth them
to kéepe their veſſels in all puritie and holineſſe
of life, and not in luſt of concupiſcence
as the wicked doe, which knowe not God.
For this ſpirit is called the ſpirite of ſanctification,
of cleanneſſe, of innocencie. If this
be ſo, that this holy ſpirite is cleane &amp; pure,
and likened to a doue: and furthermore our
bodies are ſaid to be the Temples and houſes
of the holy Ghoſt, which dwelleth within
vs, as Paul ſayeth, Knowe ye not, that
your body is the tēple of the holy Ghoſt?
1. Corinth. 3. &amp; 6. 2. Cor. 6. Seeing this is
ſo, we muſt prepare our houſes, and ſweepe
them cleane, to entertaine ſo honourable a
gheſt. If this houſe which is our body, be
vncleane, &amp; giuen to any vice, then ſurely,
as doues depart from filthy houſes: ſo this
moſt louing and moſt gentle doue, the ſpirite
of God departeth foorthwith from vs,
and then we are in a moſt miſerable caſe,
yea God will deſtroye him, that deſtroyeth
this his holy temple. Seeing then (dearely
beloued) our bodies are the temples of the

holy Ghoſt, and we haue ſuch promiſes that
he will dwell in them, if they be holy, and
threates that they ſhalbe deſtroyed, if they
be giuen ouer to ſinne and wantonneſſe: let
vs, I praye you, cleanſe our ſelues from all
filthines of the fleſh and ſpirit, and finiſh our
ſanctification in the feare of God, putting
off the workes of darkenes, and putting on
the armour of light, and let vs walke honeſtly,
as in the daye time, and make prouiſion
to receyue this holy ſpirite into our
hearts. You knowe what great preparation
you make both in your houſes, and in your
bodies, to haue your apparel neate &amp; cleane,
if you be to entertayne a Prince, a noble
man, or any worſhipfull friende of yours:
then conſider with your ſelues, that greater
care and diligence is to be had by tenne
thouſand partes, to lodge and receyue into
your houſes the Prince of princes, euen the
holy Ghoſt, the power of God. And ſeeing
he will vouchſafe to abide with you, &amp; take
your preparation in good woorth, firſt giue
him thankes for this his ſo vnſpeakeable
courteſie and kindeneſſe, and ſo vſe and behaue
your ſelues, as he may long continue
with you, to your great good and comfort,
&amp; grieue not this holy ſpirite of God, (by

whome ye are ſealed vnto the day of redēption,)
by your corrupt communication proceeding
out of your mouthes: and ſeeing he
will be content to tarry with you, and make
his abode in your houſes, let all bitternes,
and anger, and wrath, and euill ſpeaking be
put farre away from you, with all wickedneſſe.
For ſurely if theſe thinges be among
vs, he will depart from vs, and then he leaueth
vs to our owne willes. This can not
bee but a great griefe of minde, for if our
friende ſhoulde goe away from vs, by our
vncourteous dealing and vſing of him, we
woulde be ſory: much more ſhoulde we be
ſorie, when ſuch a friende departeth and
leaueth our companie, becauſe we are giuen
to vice and naughtineſſe, whoſe preſence
was all ioye, and whoſe abſence from
vs, is extreme miſerie and curſedneſſe.
Wherefore as this ſpirite was obtayned by
the meanes of prayer, ſo is he kept and preſerued
with vs by earneſt prayer, and hearing
of the worde, and other ſuch godly exerciſes
of the Chriſtians, in which they are
commanded to walke in. For the fruite of
the ſpirite is in all goodneſſe, righteouſneſſe,
and trueth, approouing that which is

acceptable and pleaſing the Lord. And here
is another effect woorthie the nothing, that
this holy Ghoſt inhabiting within the elect
and children of God, doeth make now their
workes and labours to be acceptable vnto
him, which before his comming vnto vs,
were abominable &amp; vnpleaſant vnto God:
not that our good works deſerue any thing
at his handes, but becauſe we are ingraffed
vnto Chriſt by the ſeale of his ſpirit. Therefore
that which was ill in vs before, is nowe
made good and accepted, as if it were perfite,
yea through this ſpirite, which doeth ſo
ſeaſon inwardly our actions, that they are
liked of God, we become thereby not onely
his faithfull ſeruants, &amp; deare friends, but yt
which is much more, his welbeloued ſōnes,
as Paul ſheweth vnto vs, Becauſe ye are
ſonnes, God hath ſent foorth the ſpirite of
his Sonne into your hearts, which cryeth,
Father, father. Wherfore thou art no more
a ſeruant, but a ſonne. Nowe if thou bee a
ſonne, thou art alſo ye heire of god through
Chriſt. If this be ſo, that we be made the
ſonnes of God, and haue receiued the adoption
of children by this holy ſpirite: then we
may aſſure our ſelues of ſaluation, vnleſſe
the obedient childe may doubt of the good

will of his louing father. Here then falleth
to the ground the doctrine of the Papiſtes,
that teach men to doubt and ſtande in feare
of their ſaluation. For is not this a very abſurd
and a fooliſh Poſition, that they mainteyne,
that we may call God Father, and
yet doubt, whether he will beſtowe the inheritance
of children vpon vs? Shall I call
him father, and doubt of this? For theſe are
the wordes of the holy Ghoſt, vttered by S.
Paul, That the ſpirite of God witneſſeth
with our ſpirite, that we are the ſonnes of
God. This being ſo, marke what Paul inferreth
&amp; bringeth in vpon this poynt, If we
be childrē, we are alſo heires, euen ye heires
of God, and heires annexed with Ieſus
Chriſt. Shall I now be made &amp; appoynted
an heire by good &amp; ſufficient warrant of the
holy Ghoſt, which lyeth not, nor deceyueth,
and yet doubt of my inheritance? that were
a mad thing. Can the ſeruant doubt, whether
he be his maſters man, or ſhall receyue
his wages, when he weareth his maſters
coate and cogniſance? or can one doubt of
the writing to be authentical and good, that
hath the parties hande and ſeale vnto it? Or
may a man doubt, hauing receiued earneſt
in part of payment, but that he ſhall in tyme

conuenient haue the whole, hauing bargained
with an houeſt man? Or doe we receyue
the witneſſe of honeſt men of credite
nere in matters politicall, and ſhall not we
receyue the witneſſe of God the Father, the
Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt, which is greater,
and more to bee beleeued of vs, when
hee promiſeth ſaluation to the beleeuers?
Surely if we doubt, then we haue not faith:
for he that doubteth, is not grounded in
the faith, but is like a waue of the ſea, toſt
of the winde, and caryed away, Iames 1.
How can I haue hope of ſaluation, as I am
commaunded, and yet be in deſpaire of it,
and doubt with my ſelfe? A man can not
hope for that, whereof he doubteth. Doeth
not Saint Iohn ſay playnely, We knowe
that we are tranſlated from death to life,
becauſe we loue the brethrē? He ſaith not,
We doubt of it. And againe, Hereby we
knowe that he abideth in vs, euen by his
ſpirit which he hath giuen vs. And all this
aſſurance commeth to paſſe by the teſtimonie
and witneſſe of this holie ſpirite, which
therefore is called the ſeale of God, the earneſt
penie, the ſpirite of trueth, which can
not deceyue, or be deceyued. And here I
can not but maruayle at the ignorance and

blindeneſſe of the Papiſts, which while they
go about to eſtabliſh this doctrine of error,
they impugne and ouerthrowe another of
their owne. For they ſaye, that a man may
fulfill the Lawe of God perfitly: nay they
go further, and ſay, he may fulfil the Lawe,
and doe all that God hath commaunded in
his worde written, and more to, which are
workes of ſupererogation beſides, which he
hath not commaunded, (and ſo in deede he
hath not,) and theſe workes the Monkes
and Friers doe beſtowe vpon their friendes
which lacke them, for they haue ynough for
themſelues, and theſe they ſell to others,
which are the ouerplus, and they call them
the ſtore of the Church. Nowe thus ſtandeth
the caſe. If they keepe the Lawe, then
they neede not doubt, but that God wil giue
them the rewarde of it, which is life and ſaluation:
and why then doe they doubt, if it
be true? they fulfill the commandementes:
then let them not diſtruſt of their wages
and hire. Wherefore one of theſe two muſt
needes follow: If they keepe the Lawe,
then they neede not doubt of life. If they
doubt of ſaluation, then it is certaine they
keepe not the Lawe. In one of theſe two
they muſt needes bee founde lyers by their

owne confeſſion. But in deede they are vntrue
in both of them: for it is falſe, that they
keepe the Lawe, which is a yoke that can
not be borne of any man, except Chriſt, ſeeing
it is ſpiritual, &amp; biddeth vs not to ſinne,
neyther in deede, neither in worde, no not ſo
much as once in thought, Matth. 5. And the
other is as falſe, that we ſhould doubt of our
ſaluation. But in deede the firſt author of
this doctrine, the Pope himſelfe, out of
whoſe ſhop it came, that great Antichriſt,
and a man of all abominations that euer
were, might well teache this doctrine, and
doubt of his ſaluation, liuing (as he doth) in
filthy fornication with his Curtiſanes and
harlots at Rome, ſturring vp Chriſtian
Princes to warre one with another, to
mainteyne his vnſatiable ambition, pride, &amp;
couetouſnes, with all maner of wickednes:
Mouing likewiſe the ſubiectes to rebell againſt
their lawful and natural princes and
magiſtrates, diſcharging thē of their othes
and obedience vnto their rulers. I ſaye, he
that doeth theſe things, and worſe, may wel
doubt of his ſaluation: for he hath nothing
to do in the kingdom of God. And ſo all his
adherents, folowing his ſteppes &amp; religion,
whoſe liues are altogether moſt filthie and

wicked, may be in the ſame caſe and ſtate
with their holy father the Pope. But they
ſay, We can by no meanes be ſure of our
ſaluation, becauſe we can not be ſure of our
perſeuerance in the faith of Chriſt vnto the
ende. But this is vtterly falſe: for the ſcripture
ſayth, that the godly ſhall continue and
perſeuere vnto the ende. Paul was ſure
that he had the ſpirit of God, and that cauſed
him to be perſwaded, that neyther thinges
preſent, neither things to come ſhoulde be
able to ſeparate him from the loue of God,
which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lorde. Then
we may be ſure, that thinges to come ſhall
not remoue vs from God. Againe, the loue
of God is conſtant and perfite, and whom
he once loueth, he loueth with an euerlaſting
loue, euen vnto the ende, as Chriſt is
ſayde to loue his, Iohn 13. And to whome
God hath giuen this ſpirite of adoption, as
he doeth to the Elect, he neuer taketh it away:
but is ſtil a teſtimonie vnto their conſciences,
that they ſhalbe ſaued in the ende,
and cōtinue in the meane ſeaſon in the faith
and obedience of Chriſt Ieſus their Lorde.
Yea Paul is perſuaded of the Philippians,
(and ſo muſt we be of our ſelues) that he
that hath begunne a good worke in vs, wil

performe it vntill the day of the Lord Ieſus
Chriſt, Philip. 1. And he hath the like to the
Corinthians, that God wil confirme them
vnto the ende, 1. Cor. 1. And they that are
elected, ſhal continue: For the giftes and
calling of God are without repentance,
Rom. 11. S. Iohn a man beloued of Ieſus
Chriſt, and to be beleeued before our aduerſaries,
doubted not to ſay and affirme for a
trueth, in his ſeconde Epiſtle to a vertuous
Lady, that the trueth which dwelleth in
vs, ſhalbe with vs for euer. If it ſhal remaine
with vs for euer, how ſhould we doubt, that
it can forſake vs at any time, either preſent
or to come? Proue your ſelues, ſayth Paul,
whether ye are in the faith: examine your
ſelues: knowe ye not your owne ſelues,
that Ieſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be reprobats?
Here he wil haue vs to be throughly
perſwaded, that Chriſt dwelleth in vs, &amp;
ſo to be ſure of ſaluation, vnleſſe we will be
counted reprobates, which God forbid. If ye
Papiſts wil be counted reprobates, let them
then doubt of their ſaluation: if not, then let
them recant, &amp; be aſſured of it with vs, and
amend their religion and maners ſpeedily.
Neyther is this doctrine, as ſome ignorant
perſons terme it, a doctrine of raſhneſſe and

preſumptuouſnes, vnles Gods worde teach
vs preſumption. But this is a very comfortable
doctrine, as at all times, ſo eſpecially
at the houre of death, when our conſciences
doe accuſe vs, and Satan aſſault vs,
and the paynes of death come vpon vs: (I
ſaye) this doeth comfort weake and feeble
conſciences not to deſpaire, and the other
doctrine of theirs doeth leade men the hye
way to deſperation, to doubt whether they
ſhall be ſaued or no. They ſaye, we muſt
feare. It is true: but not feare to bee damned.
For there is no damnation to them
that are in Chriſt, which walke not after
the fleſh, but after the ſpirit, Rom. 8. Neither
muſt this feare bee without faith and
hope: for then it is a ſlauiſh feare of the
whippe and ſcourge, and not a childes
feare, to feare to diſpleaſe his louing father.
Wee muſt then haue the feare of
ſonnes, not of hired ſeruantes, to feare to
offende and diſpleaſe ſo mercifull and louing
a Father, and not to feare and doubt
of our ſaluation: for it ſtandeth not in vs,
but in a ſurer rocke and grounde, which is
Ieſus Chriſt: and if we beleeue in him, we
ſhall haue euerlaſting life, Iohn 3. Act. 17.

And yet here we muſt take heede of another
extremitie, which the Meſſalians certaine
heretikes, with the Libertines, Anabaptiſts,
&amp; that wicked ſect of ye 
                     familie of loue, falleth
into: for all theſe preſume too much of
this ſpirit of God, and of their reuelations,
becauſe they ioyne not the ſpirite of God
with his word, but ſeparate it from the word
of Chriſt, and ſo it is but a fayned ſpirite of
their own fantaſtical braynes, and not from
God. Nowe as the Papiſtes take too litle,
ſo theſe men take too much, and whatſoeuer
commeth firſt into their idle heades, by
and by they attribute it to the ſpirit of God,
be it neuer ſo wicked: and ſo theſe commō
                     ly
contemne the outwarde worde and preaching
of the Goſpel, with the adminiſtration
of the Sacraments, whereas we knowe
that the ſpirite goeth, and is giuen by the
miniſterie of the worde, and is ioyned with
it, as Acts. 10. we reade, that while Peter
ſpake the worde, the holy ghoſt fell on all
them that heard the preaching, not before
the worde came: for Chriſt giueth not
his ſpirit, but by the hearing of his Goſpell
firſt preached, as Paul ſayde to the Epheſians,
After ye heard the worde of trueth,
the Goſpel of your ſaluation, wherein alſo

after that ye beleeued, ye were ſealed with
the holy Spirite of promiſe, Epheſ. 1. Here
we ſee, if any would pretend the ſpirit without
the worde, he may bee refuted: for they
goe both together, the worde of trueth with
the ſpirite of promiſe. For it is not our part
to diſſeuer, or diſioyne thoſe two things,
which God will haue coupled together in
one. And therefore the Prophetes, which
myght better haue vſed this prerogatiue of
the ſpirit then they, called alwayes the people
to the worde of the Lorde God, ſaying,
Heare the word of the Lord, Thus ſayeth
the Lord: and ſtill, The mouth of the Lord
hath ſpoken it, Eſay 1. They pretende not
the ſpirit without the worde, although they
ſpeake moſt plentifully by him, 2. Epiſt. of
Peter 1. Chapter. For the prophecie came
not in olde time by the will of man: but
holy men of God ſpake as they were moued
by the holy Ghoſt. Furthermore another
effecte of this Spirite is to moue
the heart of man, when the worde is preached
vnto him: for vnleſſe Gods Spirite
perſwade and worke in our heartes within,
when the preacher ſoundeth in our eares the
outward word, he ſhal but ſpeake as it were
in the ayre, &amp; beate the eare of man in vaine.

Paul well conſidering this, ſayde, that he
in deed had planted, and Apollos another
preacher had watered the worde, but it is
God (ſayeth he) that giueth the increaſe.
And wee knowe that God woorketh all
things in the heartes of his children by this
ſpirite, wherewith hee ſealeth them after
they haue heard and beleeued the worde
preached, Ephe. 1. and therfore in the place
aboue recited, this ſpirit is called the ſpirit
of promiſe, becauſe it doeth aſſertaine and
aſſure vs of all the bleſſinges and promiſes
of God that are made vnto vs. In the
Actes it is ſayde, that Lydia a woman
being a ſeller of purple, came to heare
Paul preach the Goſpel: but marke what
Saint Luke ſaieth, whoſe heart (ſayeth
he) the Lord opened, that ſhee attended
to the things which Paul ſpake: So that
except God open our cloſed and hard ſhutte
hearts, by the ſecret inſpiration of this holy
ſpirite, in vayne ſhall we eyther preach, or
the people heare. We haue neede then all of
vs (before we come to heare his word) pray
to God to giue vs grace to perceyue &amp; vnderſtand
his will and myſteries, &amp; to ſoften
our ſtony hearts, that they may receiue the
worde, and to circumciſe our eares to heare

it. This it that Dauid ſayde, O Lord open
thou mine eyes, that I may ſee the wonderfull
things of thy Lawe: and againe, O
giue me vnderſtanding, &amp; I wil keepe thy
Lawe. Now Dauid knewe very well that
all theſe things were done by the operation
of Gods ſpirite, as Paul ſayeth, The ſpirit
hath reuealed theſe things vnto vs, 1. Cor.
2. for it is hee that helpeth all our infirmities,
Rom. 8. This is the marke whereby
God doeth ſeale and print in the forehead, to
be ſeene of all men, thoſe that are his, and
without the which no man can truely aſſure
him ſelfe that he belongeth vnto Chriſt: for
as the ſame Apoſtle witneſſeth, If any man
haue not the Spirite of Chriſt, the ſame
is none of his. Nowe how greatly this holy
ſpirit is to be deſired of all of vs, there is no
man that hath read the Scriptures, but well
vnderſtandeth. This made Eliſeus, a notable
man, the ſcholer of Elias, when his maſter
bad him to aſke of him what he would,
that he might do it for him before he was taken
away from him into heauen, that he aſked
his ſpirite to bee doubled vpon him,
whereby he might the better ſerue the Lord
and his Church in his vocation and calling,
2. King. 2. and ſo by this ſpirit he wrought

wonderful miracles, and did much good by
it to the whole kingdome of Iſrael. Wee
ſee by this petition of this notable father &amp;
godly man, what we alſo ſhoulde eſpecially
deſire of God in our prayers: not riches or
wealth ſo much, which al do periſh, but this
holy ſpirite which liueth &amp; remaineth for euer
in them that haue him, and can neuer be
loſt or taken away. And this is the ſelf ſame
thing that our Sauiour Chriſt would haue
vs to aſke in our praiers of God his father:
for ſpeaking of praier to his diſciples, he ſheweth
that God his Father is moſt ready to
giue vs our requeſts, as ſoone as we aſke of
him: as our earthly father is willing to beſtow
that vpon vs which he is able to giue.
And of all other things that God giueth, he
maketh mention of this ſpirit, ſaying, If ye
which are euill, can giue good giftes vnto
your children, how much more ſhall your
heauenly Father giue ye holy Ghoſt to thē
that deſire him? Luk. 11. Signifying this
Spirite to be the excellenteſt gift that God
coulde giue, or we deſire of him. We haue
nowe heard the meaning of this article, of
the holy Ghoſt, what it is, and what are
the wonderfull and comfortable effectes of
it in the Church, and howe the Lorde hath

promiſed neuer to leaue his deſtitute of it
vnto the worlds ende: We haue ſeene alſo
howe we muſt beleeue in him, as the true
and euerlaſting God, equally proceeding
from the Father and the Sonne, becauſe he
is the power and vertue, whereby they doe
worke and create all things. Seeing therefore
this heauenly ſpirit is ſo neceſſarie and
ſo great a treaſure, let vs that are true
Chriſtians moſt duetifully thanke our heauenly
Father, for beſtowing of him vpon
his whole familie here in earth, and vpon euery
one of vs that are his ſeruants, wherby
we are knowen in the worlde, and among
our ſelues, that wee are his owne. And let
vs alſo pray vnto our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt,
the ſender of this holy ſpirit, to kindle and
ſtirre him vp in our heartes dayly more and
more, that by his aſſiſtance, we may haue an
earneſt feeling and lothing of our ſinnes,
and ſo bee brought to doe his will and pleaſure,
with a carefull keeping of all his
commaundements, vntill we all come to
a full perfection in Ieſus Chriſt, euen vnto
that hope which is layde vp for vs in the
newe and heauenly Ieruſalem, which
Chriſt hath purchaſed full dearely for vs,
with his owne precious heart blood. To

whom with his Father, and the holy ghoſt,
three perſons in trinitie, and yet one God
in vnitie, be rendred all prayſe, honour,
glorie and thankes giuing, both nowe and
for euermore, Amen.
               
               
                  The ninth Lecture vpon
the ninth Article of our
Chriſtian fayth:
                  The holy catholike Church, the communion
of Saints.
                  
                     WE haue declared alreadie vnto
you, three parts of this our Chriſtian
fayth: the fyrſt, wherein we
doe beleeue and confeſſe the Father
to bee the Creator and maker of all
things: the ſeconde part, wherein we acknowledge
the Sonne Ieſus Chriſt the
redeemer of mankinde: the thirde ſheweth
vnto vs the holy Ghoſt, the comforter of
our heartes, and the confirmer of all theſe
things which are conteyned in theſe former
eyght articles, which we haue proued all
out of the euerlaſting worde of GOD.

Nowe followeth conſequently the fourth
part of our Chriſtian beliefe, which is concerning
the Church, the ninth article with
other three which are annexed vnto the
Church, as the eſpeciall bleſſings and benefites
which flowe and iſſue out of the former
partes, and alwayes doe accompanie
and followe the ſpouſe of Chriſt. The
cauſes and matter of our ſaluation being
alreadie handled, the effect doeth followe,
which is the Church: Otherwiſe in vayne
ſhoulde God create, and Chriſt redeeme,
and the holy Ghoſt inſpire and confirme
theſe benefites and giftes, vnleſſe there
were ſome that myght bee partakers of
thoſe treaſures, brought out and founded
by the bleſſed Trinitie. Againe, ſeeing
the kingdome of Chriſt is euerlaſting, it
is very neceſſarie and requiſite, that there
be alwayes ſome which may acknowledge
him for their King and gouernour. To this
ende hath Chriſt his continuall Church,
and ſhall haue to the ende of the worlde, as
he hath had euer from the firſt beginning.
The meaning therefore of this article, is
this: I beleeue that God almightie hath
alwayes had from the firſt creation of the

worlde, and hath preſently, and ſhall haue
vnto the conſummation of the worlde, his
Church here in earth, which is, the cōmunion
of Saints, that is to ſay, a company and
congregation of faythfull men and women,
which doe truely beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt,
acknowledging him for their onely Sauiour,
and ſeruing him according to his
worde, receyuing his Sacraments, and
taking holde of all his mercies and benefites
by fayth onely in his blood: and for
this cauſe doe wee beleeue that there is but
one true Catholique Church, and no moe
which ſhall continue for euer, although
Satan and his miniſters goe about by
all meanes poſſible to ouerthrowe and ſubuert
it. Wee are then taught here to beleeue,
that there is an vniuerſall Church of
Chriſt, and not to beleeue and truſt in it, as
we doe in God: for that were idolatrie, to
truſt in men and put our confidēce in them.
But wee muſt truſt in GOD onely,
and not in this Church, as the Papiſtes
woulde beare vs in hande: becauſe the
Church is but the company of the elect and
choſen, and are men. Nowe wee can not
beleeue and put our hope in any thing

that is a creature, for that were blaſphemie
to ſay, and wee are alſo accurſed if wee do
ſo, as the holy Prophete Ieremie hath by
the mouth of the holy Ghoſt forewarned
vs, ſaying, Thus ſayth the Lorde, Curſed
bee the man that truſteth in man, and maketh
fleſh his arme, and withdraweth his
heart from the Lorde: for hee ſhall be like
the heath in the wildernes, and ſhall not
ſee when any good commeth, but ſhall
inhabite the parched places in the wilderneſſe,
in a ſalte lande and not inhabited,
Ier. 17. By theſe woordes then of the holy
ghoſt, we learne, not to beleeue in ye Church,
but that there is an holy Church of Chriſte
in this worlde euery where diſperſed and
ſcattered abroad through the face of ye whole
earth. This article doeth declare vnto vs
what the Church is, terming it the communion
of Saintes, or fellowſhippe
of the godly, eyther with Chriſt, or els with
themſelues in loue: furthermore what maner
of Church this is, is here likewiſe ſet
downe, that it is holy, by reaſon of Chriſt her
head: &amp; catholike, becauſe it is not tied to any
one place, as Rome, but generally is in all
places of the earth, toſſed as a ſhip vpon the
ſea frō one coaſt to another, as pleaſeth God

to diſpoſe of it. To theſe things, two other
pointes may be adioyned, to make vp the
perfit diſcourſe of it, and to the which all other
thinges incident to any maner queſtion
of the Church, may bee eaſely referred.
The one is, to conſider who is the vniuerſall
head and gouernour of this catholique
Church: the other, by what true markes,
notes, ſignes, and titles, this Church may
be knowen, and diſcerned from the falſe and
counter faite ſynagogue of Satan, that is,
from the whoriſhe and Babylonicall ſtrumpet
of Rome, which falſly taketh vpon her
the name of this chaſte wife and ſpouſe of
Chriſte, being an vncleane and a moſt adulterous
harlot, which hath long agoe forſaken
her bridegrome Ieſus Chriſt, as
it ſhall (God willing) hereafter better appeare,
in the diſcourſe and tract of this
matter. Seeing the Church is likened
to an houſe, 1. Timothie 3. and euery
houſe is builded and gouerned of ſome
man, Hebr. 3. it is neceſſarie that this houſe
alſo, which is the Church of the liuing God,
haue ſome builder &amp; head of it to looke vnto
it, which is both able to do it, &amp; moſt ready to
helpe it. The builder of this Chruch is Ieſus
Chriſt, Mat. 16. 18. &amp; he is the only head

of it, as S. Paul doth proue moſt manifeſtly
vnto vs, both in the 1. &amp; 4. chap. of ye epiſtle
of the Epheſians, and the 1. chapter to the
Coloſ. ſaying, God hath made all thinges
ſubiect vnder his feet, and hath giuen him
ouer al thinges to be ye head to the Church,
which is his body, euen the fulneſſe of him
that filleth all in al things. And againe, Let
vs folow the trueth in loue, and in al things
growe vp vnto him, which is the head, that
is Chriſt, by whom all the body being coupled
and knit together by euery ioynt, for
the furniture thereof, according to the
effectuall power which is in the meaſure
of euery part, receyueth increaſe of the body
vnto ye edifiyng of it ſelfe in loue, Ephe.
4. So in the Coloſ. 1. 18. He is the head of
the body of the Church. Out of this doeth
the body of Chriſt which is his Church, receyue
a ſpecial and ſinguler comfort againſt
al tētations, yt they ſhalbe defended &amp; preſerued
for euer: for Chriſt cā not forſake his body,
he cā not but loue it, &amp; nouriſh it, wt thoſe
ſpiritual graces which come &amp; proceede frō
him ye head &amp; fountaine. For as we ſee in the
body naturall, how yt the head receiueth not
meate for it ſelfe, but for the cheriſhing and
increaſing of the ſtrength of the body, and

the reſt of the members: ſo the Lorde Ieſus
is not an head for himſelf, but for vs, neyther
hath hee receyued all power and authoritie
of his father, with the fulneſſe of the holy
Ghoſt, to keepe it to him ſelfe, but to giue
and to impart it moſt louingly and liberally
to his true members, to make them to
grow vp more and more, till they come to a
perfection in him. If Chriſt therefore haue
ſtrength, holineſſe, power, and all other
good giftes and graces of the ſpirite, then
may the Church aſſure her ſelfe of them all,
becauſe the wife may recken that all
the goodes and landes of her huſbande are
hers: and wee knowe that the Church hath
this dignitie and prerogatiue, which is ineſtimable
and full of wonderfull loue, that
ſhee is counted and called, as ſhee is in very
deede, the chaſte wife and ſpouſe of Chriſte
here vpon the earth, to whome hee is ioyned
with the coniunction and fellowſhippe of
his heauenly ſpirite. I haue (ſayth Paul)
prepared you for one huſband, to preſent
you as a pure virgin vnto Chriſt, 2. Corin.
11. Cantic. 4. Ezechiel 16. Epheſians 5.
What noble man will bee content to take
a poore wretched beggerwoman out of
the ſtreetes, full of ragges and filthineſſe,

to make her his wife? And yet the Lorde
Ieſus hath done greater thinges in mercie
for vs, then this: for when hee paſſed by,
hee looked vpon vs, and beholde, our
tyme was as the time of loue, hee ſpredde
his ſkirtes ouer vs and couered our filthineſſe,
yea, hee ſware vnto vs, and entred
into couenant with vs, and we became
his owne. So is the Lorde in mariage
become nowe our head, and wee his ſpouſe:
let vs then take heede that wee admitte no
others into his loue, or defile our ſelues
with whoredome and idolatrie, in giuing
our faith and allegeance to ſtraungers and
falſe goddes, whome wee knowe not. Our
huſbande is very ielous ouer vs: hee can
not abide another man to bee admitted vnto
his bedde, for that were ſpirituall fornication
and adulterie before him, which hee
wyll puniſhe moſt ſeuerely, as hee did in
the Iſraelites which brake couenant with
him, and betooke them ſelues to Idoles,
and bowed downe to them in ſteade of him,
as the Prophete declareth, Ezechiel 16.
Seeyng then Chriſt is appoynted the head
of his Church, and that one wife (as there
is but one bodie, which is the Church)
can haue but one huſbande to bee her head,

and one houſe, but one Lorde and maſter to
rule it: what wickedneſſe is it to ſay that
the Pope of Rome is an vniuerſall head
ouer the Church? Is not this to take away
Chriſtes roome and dignitie, or rather
is it not to make the Church a monſter to
haue two heades in one body? But they ſay
that the Byſhope of Rome is the viſible
heade in Chriſtes ſteade: but this they can
not ſhewe by Scripture, neither doeth the
Church require any ſuch heade: for Chriſt
is preſent with it, as he hath promiſed, Mat.
28. I am with you alwayes, euen vnto
the ende of the worlde. If the Pope be a
viſible heade, why is he not ſeene of al men?
why doeth he not gouerne all men in the
Church, and giue nouriſhment vnto them,
as the heade ought to doe? This he doth
not: wherefore he is no viſible heade, as he
doth pretende. And ſurely to be the general
head ouer al, is too great a matter &amp; enterpriſe
for any mortal man to take vpō him. I
am ſure the Pope will graunt him ſelfe to
be a member of this Catholike Church: If
hee then bee a member, howe can hee be an
head, except the ſame thing ſhalbe both an
heade and member, which is very abſurde &amp;
monſtruous? If he ſay, that as he is a member,

Chriſt is his head only, and not another:
why ſhall not Chriſt bee as well a head for
all? Theſe thinges (wee ſee) are very childiſh
and fonde. But yet they apply and ſay,
that Chriſt ſayde to Peter, Thou art Peter,
and vpon this rocke will I builde my
Church. Firſt note, hee ſayth not vpon
thee Peter will I builde, but vpon this
rocke, meaning, the fayth of Peters confeſſion,
which confeſſed him to be Chriſt:
therefore by the rocke hee meant himſelfe.
For when Peter had ſayd, Thou art Chriſt
the ſonne of God, Chriſt ſayd to him, Vpon
this rocke will I builde my Church: and
in that place hee giueth no more to Peter
in the keys, which is the binding and loſing
of ſinners, then he giueth to thē al els where,
as in Ioh. 20. when he ſaid, Receiue the holy
Ghoſt: whoſoeuers ſinnes ye remit, they are
remitted, &amp; whoſoeuers ſinnes ye reteyne,
they are reteyned. Here all haue as much
as Peter: and if they will beleeue the fathers,
which they brag of much, they do neuer
referre this vnto Peter alone, but to the
reſt of ye apoſtles &amp; to al faithful miniſters of
Ieſus Chriſt. As Origē in his 1. homi. vpō
Mat. &amp; ſo doth Cyprian, Ambroſe, Ierome,
&amp; Auguſtine. And what hath ye pope to do wt
                     
theſe woordes, which followeth not Peter,
neyther in life nor doctrine? A ſtrange thing
it is to ſee, how they builde their kingdome
vpon Peter, and whatſoeuer is ſaide of him,
they take it to them ſelues. But before they
can prooue any thing in deede, they muſt
prooue theſe three poyntes vnto vs, if they
wil haue the Pope to be the ſupreme head of
the whole Church, which they ſhall be neuer
able to doe by the ſcriptures, as long as they
liue. Firſt, they muſt prooue yt Peter was
chiefe and head of all the Apoſtles. Secondly,
that he was at Rome, and ſate there as
Biſhop generall. Thirdly, that hee left all
the title and preeminence of this ſeate to his
ſucceſſours whatſoeuer. If they prooue the
two firſt poyntes, (as they can not) yet
they make nothing againſt vs, although we
ſhoulde graunt it them, vnles they proue the
third, (which they ſhall neuer be able to do)
that Peter hath left all his authoritie to his
ſucceſſours after him for euer. Foraſmuch
then as the Pope neither is nor cā be any eccleſiaſticall
head to this Church, but Chriſte
Ieſus alone, which is alwayes preſēt wt it, &amp;
euer walketh in the midſt of the ſeuē golden
cādleſticks, ſo yt he needeth no vicar general,
or vniuerſal B. let vs, dearly beloued, as we

loue the Lorde Ieſus our head, and tender
the ſaluation of our owne ſoules, flee farre
from the Pope and all his adherents, traditions,
decrees and pardons, leſt hee make
marchandiſe alſo of our ſoules, as he doth
of a great many, both in Rome &amp; Spaine,
and els where. This being ſet downe as a
moſt certaine and ſure principle, that Chriſt
is the head of this church, it would be ſeene
what authoritie this church hath, and what
rule or power is graunted vnto it. If the
Papiſtes will graunt, (as they can not deny,
but) that this church is the wife, &amp; chaſte
and obedient ſpouſe to her Lorde and huſband
Ieſus Chriſt: If (I ſay) they will admit
this, this controuerſie betweene them
and vs, of the authoritie of the Churche,
whether it be greater then the ſcriptures,
and worde of Chriſt, ſhall not bee hard to
diſcuſſe, but ſoone ended. For what authoritie
&amp; iuriſdiction a wiſe man wil graunt to
his wife vnder him, that libertie is to bee
graunted to the church vnder Chriſt. If it
be reaſon and iuſt, that a wife ſhoulde not
controll, or be ſuperior, and aboue her huſbandes
worde and commaundement, hauing
a wiſe and diſcrete huſbande, to gouerne
and commaunde her: then is it no

reaſon or right (whatſoeuer ye papiſts ſay) yt
the authoritie of the church, which is the
wife, ſhould be greater and of more force,
then the woorde and will of the huſbande
Chriſt, ſeeing that S. Paul ſaith, Eph. 5. 24.
that the church is in ſubiection to Chriſt,
and from thence draweth an argument of
the obedience and ſubiection of wiues to
their huſbands, which ſurely can not be ſo
in euery thing, as Paul there willeth, except
the Church bee in ſubiection, and vnder
the authoritie of the will and commandement
of the huſbande in all things. If
they will not permit, but thinke it vnreaſonable,
vnles they goe againſt ſcripture,
that the wiues authoritie ſhould bee either
equall or ſuperiour to the huſband, why
then doe they ſuffer and teache, that the decrees
and conſtitutions of the churche, to
make articles, lawes, ſacramēts, and other
rites and ceremonies, are aboue the authoritie
of the written worde? and ſo conſequently
aboue Chriſt him ſelfe, which can
not be ſeparated from his worde and will,
which hee will haue vs to receiue as him
ſelfe? For ſpeaking of his Apoſtles and
other miniſters, that brought his worde to
the people, he ſaith, He that receiueth you,
receiueth me, and hee that deſpiſeth you,

deſpiſeth me. And therefore, when the aduerſaries
ſaye, that the authoritie of the
Church is greater then the woorde and
ſcriptures of God, what doe they ſaye els,
but that man is aboue God, &amp; the wife aboue
the huſband? The one is blaſphemy,
and the other abſurde. Wee ſee then by
theſe thinges, that the authoritie of the
church, is to obey Chriſt in all things, and
to doe ſuch workes and buſines as he hath
commanded in his worde, except it bee in
indifferent matters, not repugning vnto
the worde, nor hindering godlines, and being
voyde of ſuperſtition, and without
clogge of conſcience. The Church is compared
and likened to an houſe, 1. Timoth. 3
or to a family: and ſhall the houſhold and
family be aboue the authoritie and will of
the maſter? ſhall the ſeruantes and children
haue greater authoritie in their doings,
then the Lorde and father of the
houſe? Howe doe theſe thinges agree together?
And howe hath Satan (the God
of this worlde) blynded the eyes of the
Pope and his ſhauelings, that the light of
the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt ſhoulde not
ſhine vnto them? But let vs heare their
proofes and arguments for this authoritie.

The church (ſay they) hath allowed and approued
the ſcriptures, &amp; diſcerned the falſe
from the true, admitting the Goſpell of
Matthewe, Marke, Luke, and Iohn, and
reiecting the Goſpell of Nicodenius, and
Thomas with others: therefore it is aboue
the ſcriptures. A goodly argument and reaſon.
As if they ſhould argue thus: I doe allowe
and approue the authoritie of the
prince, therefore I am greater and aboue
her authoritie. If they would make this
reaſon with her, as they make the like with
Ieſus Chriſt, they might (peraduenture)
come ſhort home, and be found traitours to
her, (as in the ſupremacie of the Pope they
all are, if they holde their owne doctrine &amp;
mainteine it,) as they are to Ieſus Chriſt,
their chiefe prince. Againe, one man telleth
another which is the king, and diſcerneth
him from one that is not the king: therefore
he that doeth thus tel and diſcerne the
king from another mā, is greater then the
king in authoritie. This is their reaſon, &amp;
all one. The church (forſooth) becauſe it
hath diſcerned the true writings of the holy
Ghoſt, from thoſe that were coūterfaite
and falſe, therefore they will haue ye church
to be aboue this worde: which is vtterly

falſe, and in no point foloweth. They might
by this reaſon proue them ſelues, or others
to be aboue God him ſelfe, becauſe many
can diſcerne and tyre the true and liuing
God from the forged and falſe gods, and
they can tyre and ſeparate the true ſpirite
from the lying ſpirite: therefore they are
greater in authoritie, then this ſpirite of
God is. Who ſeeth not theſe things to bee
ſo childiſh, that they neede no refutation at
all, becauſe if they be once examined by the
touchſtone, they fall of them ſelues, and do
eaſely deſcrie what they are? Well, let vs
holde this for a grounde moſt certaine and
ſure, which can not bee ſhaken: that the
worde which Chriſt hath ſpoken in his
fathers name, the ſame ſhall iudge in the
laſt day, as hee him ſelfe ſayth, Iohn. 12.
verſe 48. Then if the worde be iudge, it is
(belike) greater, and aboue them that muſt
be iudged by it (which is the church) in the
latter daye, euen as the iudge here is of
greater authoritie, then the partie whome
he iudgeth. And here by the way falleth to
the ground, another falſe poſitiō of theirs,
that ſay the interpretatiō of the ſcriptures
muſt be according to the church: nay it muſt
be according to ye word, which is the iudge:

for if this be a matter of controuerſie, who
ſhall determine and decide it, but the ordinarie
iudge? as we ſee the lawes muſt bee
interpreted, not according to the cenſure
and iudgement of them to whome they
were giuen, but after the will and meaning
of the iudge and lawe giuer, which made
them: ſo the ſcriptures muſt bee interpreted
by the ſcriptures, and the worde, by the
worde, and that which is ſpoken obſcurely
in one place, by that which is declared and
vttered more plainely in an other place.
As for example: The papiſtes, to proue that
ſinnes may be forgiuen hereafter in an other
worlde, in their fayned purgatorie,
bring this place out of the 12. chapter of
Matthewe, where our ſauiour ſaith, that
he that ſpeaketh a worde againſt the holy
Ghoſt, ſhall not bee forgiuen, neither in
this worlde nor in the worlde to come:
Ergo ſay they, to eſtabliſh their purgatorie,
ſome ſinnes may be forgiuen after this life,
and where is that, but in purgatorie: but
if they had read the thirde of Marke (handling
the ſame matter) and conferred one
place with an other, they ſhould haue ſeene
there, that our ſauiours meaning was to
ſhewe, that the horriblenes of this ſinne

was ſo great, that it ſhould neuer be forgiuen:
for theſe are his verie wordes there.
Verely I ſay vnto you, al ſinnes ſhalbe forgiuē
vnto ye childrē of mē, &amp; blaſphemies,
wherewith they blaſpheme: but he that
blaſphemeth againſt the holy Ghoſt, ſhall
neuer haue forgiuenes, but is culpable of
eternall damnation, Mark. 3. So likewiſe
is that place in Matthewe of the keyes expounded
in Iohn 20. by remitting or retaining
of ſinnes by all the Apoſtles, and not
by Peter only. Nowe out of this note that
Chriſt is the head and only great ſhepheard
of his church, commeth forth many good &amp;
fruitfull branches for this whole church,
that is, many good leſſons for vs in doctrine
&amp; maners: For if Chriſt be ye head of
this congregation, then it ſhalbe perpetual
and for euer, becauſe ye head of it is for euer,
therefore the body muſt be ſo alſo. As the
Lord promiſeth in Ieremie cha. 31. ſaying,
This ſaieth the Lorde, which giueth the
ſunne for a light to the day, and the courſes
of the moone and of the ſtarres a light
to the night, which breaketh the ſea when
the waues thereof roare, his name is the
Lord of hoſtes. If theſe ordinances depart
out of my ſight, (ſayeth the Lorde) then

ſhall the ſeede of Iſrael ceaſe from being a
nation before me for euer. Thus ſayth the
Lorde, If the heauens can be meaſured, or
the foundations of the earth be ſearched
out beneath: then will I caſt off all the
ſeede of Iſrael, for all that they haue done,
ſayth the Lorde. By the which wordes the
Lorde meaneth that his church ſhall continue
for euer, as ye ſunne, moone &amp; ſtarres
doe: which ſurely is very comfortable to
all his, to conſider that they ſhall be for euer,
as their head is, and haue immortalitie
with him. Againe, if Chriſt be from the beginning,
then he hath had this church alſo
from the beginning: firſt in Adam, then in
Abel, and Seth, and ſo foorth in Noe. And
this he hath, and will preſerue: for they are
his members, whome he loueth, and feedeth
as a father doth his deare and owne children,
Pſalm. 103. And if Chriſt be the head
of it, it muſt needes be holy alſo, as here we
doe beleeue. For howe ſhould the body be
vnholy, when the head is ſo holy? although
this holines be not ful and perfite here, (for
the church is in a continuail warrefare and
fight againſt ſinne and wickedneſſe,) yet it
ſhall be perfited hereafter, when it ſhalbe
fully ioyned wt her head in heauen. In the

meane ſeaſon it is called holy, becauſe it
contendeth for holineſſe, and becauſe the
holineſſe of Chriſt is imputed vnto it: but
this is not in it ſelfe: for the church is
taught to pray daily, Forgiue vs our treſpaſes:
and there is no man without ſinne
that liueth here in earth, 1. Ioh. 1. yea this
church may, and hath erred, as euery member
particularly may erre, as Peter did in
the vocation of ye Gentiles, Act. 10. and in
diſſimulation, in eating with the Gentiles,
&amp; withdrawing himſelf from them againe,
when Iames came to him, and was iuſtly
therefore reprehended of Saint Paul, Gal.
2. Then if Peter erred, ſo notable &amp; ſingular
an Apoſtle, others may erre alſo, but yet
returne with Peter: yea the whole church
at ſome time haue erred, as al the Apoſtles
doubted of Chriſtes reſurrection, and yet
they were the Church of Chriſt, and the
beſt men and moſt perfite that were then aliue,
Mark. 16. verſe 14. This I ſay to that
ende, that none ſhould imagine ſuch a perfection
in the church, as the Anabaptiſts
doe and others, which can not be attayned
vnto in this life: And therefore becauſe
they ſee ſome abuſes, ſome diſſolute perſons,
and ſome errors in the Church (which

is like a field that hath corne and tares in
it) they by and by depart from it, and break
and diuide the vnitie of the Church, by
their ignorance and frowardneſſe, not
knowing yt the kingdome of heauen (which
is the Church) is cōpared of Chriſt himſelf
to a net caſt into the Sea, that taketh both
good and bad fyſhes together in it. Mat. 13.
I ſpeake not this, to mayntayne any thing
that is amiſſe, if it may be reformed by
order. For I wiſh all thinges to be wel,
which are out of order in our church, and I
hope God will in his time cut off all diſorders:
but I ſpeake it to this ende, that
none ſhould ſeparate himſelf from hearing
the woorde and receauing ye Sacraments,
and from publicke prayers in the congregation.
If al things in the miniſtery be not
ſo perfect as euery goodman would deſire,
and as the word of God requireth it ſhould
bee, we muſt in deede contend and indeuour
for a perfection, as much as lyeth in vs,
which I pray God may be earneſtly ſought
for of euery one in his vocation. But they
that are priuate men, muſt helpe with their
prayers, their teares and groninges, and
muſt ſeeke to further this woorke by continuall
interceſſion to the Lorde, and neuer

to leaue off, neyther to giue him any
reſt, vntill he repayre, and vntill hee ſet vp
Ieruſalem the prayſe of the worlde. And
ſo for Sions ſake, they muſt not holde
their tongue, vntil the righteouſneſſe therof
breake foorth as a light, and the ſaluation
thereof vs a burning lampe. Which
God put into the heartes and mindes of
them that haue authoritie in the buylding
and repairing of this ſpiritual Church vnto
the Lord. For Chriſt himſelfe frequented
the temple at Hieruſalem, and there
taught the people his fathers wil, although
the hie Prieſts, the Scribes, and Phariſes
had made it a dēne of theeues, and wonderfully
corrupted all things in it, both by
their doctrine, and alſo by their manners:
neither did Paul ſeparate himſelfe from
the church of the Corinthians, although
many abuſes had crept in among them, in
ſo much, that ſome denied the reſurrection,
the chiefeſt poynt one of them in Chriſtianitie,
yet notwithſtanding all this, hee
called it a Church, and the Corinthians
ſanctifyed in Ieſus Chriſt. And ſo wee ſee
he did not withdrawe himſelfe from them,
but vouchſafed thē the name of ye church,

and goeth about (as wee ſhould all doe,) to
bring them to the purity of the Goſpel againe.
Thus much for this poynt: let vs
returne to our purpoſe. Chriſt being the
head of this church, it ſhall not be hard for
vs to diſcerne who are the members of it,
and who appertayne vnto the ſame. This
church is ſaid to be holy, and the communion
of ſayntes: then all they that are holy,
&amp; ſāctified by ye ſpirit of Ieſus Chriſt, are of
ye nūber of this cōgregation: for if they wil
be of his body, they muſt haue frō him holineſſe,
which hath ſaid. Be ye holy, for I am
holy: &amp; they ought to reſēble him in their
life &amp; cōuerſatiō, in godlines, in integrity,
in innocēcie &amp; al other chriſtiā vertues. We
ſee then howe we onght to endeuour to be
like him, &amp; theſe are the words of S. Iohn,
where that he ſayth, He that remayneth in
him, ought euen ſo to walke, as hee hath
walked: That is, he muſt be incorporated &amp;
ingrafted to the body of Chriſt, otherwiſe
there is no ſaluation for him. He is the true
vine, and we are the branches: if we abide
in him, we bring forth much fruite, &amp; wee
ſhalbe purged to bring forth more fruite:
but as the branche, except it abide in the
vine, dieth &amp; withereth away without any

fruit, and is caſt into ye fire: ſo is euery one,
that is not of the body of Ieſus Chriſt. Let
vs therefore indeuour to be of this body, for
without the Church is no ſaluation, as all
periſhed by the waters, which were not in
the arke of Noe, which was a true ſigne
and figure of the church, 1. Pet. 3. And as the
hand cut off frō the body, dieth, and lacketh
life: ſo it is in the myſticall body of the
Church, no lyfe without the body of Chriſt:
and that is the thing that is meant in theſe
places of holy ſcripture. In the thirteenth
chapter of Ezechiel ye Lord threatneth the
falſe prophets, that his hand ſhalbe vpon
them that ſee vanity, &amp; deuine lyes, ſaying,
They ſhall not be in the aſſembly of my
people, neither ſhal they be written in the
writing of the houſe of Iſrael, neither ſhal
they enter into the land of Iſrael. Wherby
he excludeth them frō his church. So it is
ſaid in Ioel the ſecond, In mount Sion and
Ieruſalem ſhalbe deliuerance, as the Lord
hath ſayde. The like is in Abdie: but moſt
notable is yt place in the ſecond of ye Acts,
where it is ſayd, that the Lorde added to
the church from day to day, ſuch as
ſhoulde be ſaued: giuing vs thus much to
vnderſtād, yt vnles they be in ye church, there

is no ſaluation for them. By this then we
gather, that if they only be mēbers of this
church, which beleeue in Chriſt, and are
holy, then the Turkes &amp; Iewes, which beleeue
not in Chriſt, but perſecute him moſt
deadly, are not of ye church, becauſe they are
not vnited &amp; ioyned to this body. Likewiſe
all the Heretikes, which haue broken the
vnity &amp; peace of this Church, ſome by denying
the humanitie of Chriſt, and ſome
his diuinitie, are not to be counted members
of Chriſt, neither they that haue departed
from the felowſhip of the godly and
ſayntes of God to Antichriſt, can haue any
part in this congregation, or be heyres of
life, vnles they returne againe with ſpeede
to the Church. Here likewiſe are all Atheiſts
and vngodly liuers ſhut out from
this church. For they communicate not wt
the ſaintes, either in life or doctrine, neither
doe they relieue the poore and afflicted
members of Ieſus Chriſt with ye bleſſings
which God hath beſtowed vpon them:
ſo that there is no communion of brotherly
loue among them, whereby they ſhould be
knowen to be of this holy body. Now yt we
know that Chriſt is ye head of this church,
(as is proued) let vs come to ye ſecōd point,

to ſee by what markes and tokens this true
church may be diſcerned from ye falſe &amp; hypocricall
ſinagogue of Satan. For this
ſtandeth vs greatly in hand to know, otherwiſe
we may be deceiued in taking the one
for the other. Two ſignes there are wherby
ye church of Chriſt is knowen: ye one is the
preaching of the word of God, contained
in ye old &amp; new Teſtamēt, &amp; is deuided into
ye law &amp; Goſpel: ſo that where this word is
ſoūded out by ye preachers, purely &amp; ſoundly,
wtout mixture &amp; corruptiō of mās traditiōs,
&amp; receaued reuerētly, there is no doubt
the church of Chriſt, as Chriſt himſelf doth
witnes, My ſheepe here my voice &amp; follow
me. This is thē ye firſt &amp; principal note of ye
church, to heare Chriſts word, Iohn 10. and
where this word wanteth, there can be no
church. For Chriſt doth ſāctifie &amp; clenſe it
by ye waſhing of water through the word,
Eph. 5. This made ye prophets in olde time
to be careful y• they brought nothing but ye
word of God to ye people, ſaying. Heare the
worde of the Lord. The mouth of ye Lord
hath ſpoken: and alwaies they brought the
people when they were gone aſtray, to this
worde &amp; cōmandement of the Lord. This
made S. Paul to ſay, y• 
                     he had deliuered no
other thing to ye church of the Corinthiās,

thē that he had receyued of ye Lord, 1. Cor.
11. Neither did Chriſt, when he ſent his Apoſtles
abroad to preach, giue thē liberty to
preach what they liſt: But go and preach,
(ſayth hee,) teaching them to obſerue all
things, whatſoeuer I haue cōmanded you:
reſtraining thē alwaies to his word, whereby
y• church is gathered together, not the
word vnwritten, which they call vnwritten
verities, &amp; yt traditions of the Apoſtles, and
y• church, but the word written only. For of
the other wee haue no certainty, yea their
vnwritten verities are againſt the written
veritie and worde of Chriſt, which is a
thing very abſurde. For the worde written
doeth allowe all meates to be eaten with
thankeſgiuing without choyſe, any apparel
to be worne without differēce: neither doth
it condemne matrimonie in any degree or
eſtate of perſons, as they do in the miniſters
of the woorde. Now their vnwritten verities
doe forbid al theſe things, and a great
many moe, which are contrary to the word
reueiled. Wel, let vs holde this poynt diligently,
that the worde truely preached, is
the firſt note to know this church by: the
other note is the true vſe &amp; adminiſtration
of ye ſacramēts, inſtituted by Chriſt himſelf,

which are two in number: the one is Baptiſme,
wherein we are admitted into the fellowſhippe
of this Church of Chriſt, and by
the which we are aſſured of the remiſſion of
our ſinnes by Chriſtes blood, as wee are
ſure, that the water doeth outwardly waſh
the body and ſpottes of the fleſh. This Sacrament
doth Paul call the waſhing of the
new byrth, Titus 5. and ſayth, that all they
that are baptized vnto Chriſt, haue put on
Chriſt. Furthermore the Lord Ieſus doeth
not thinke it ſufficient, or ynough to admit
vs onely into his houſe and familie, by this
ſigne of Baptiſme, but doeth alſo being admitted,
feede vs continually with heauenly
and ſpirituall foode vnto euerlaſting life,
which is done with the other Sacrament of
his precious body &amp; blood, called the Communion
or the Lordes Supper. So that as
the ſhephearde doeth not onely gather his
ſheepe into his folde or ſheepecote, but doth
alſo prouide meat for them, and paſture: and
as the maſter doeth not onely enterteine his
ſeruant into his ſeruice, by giuing him his
liuery coate and badge, whereby he is openly
knowen to be his man, but doeth prouide
and giue him meate &amp; drinke dayly to feede
him: ſo ſurely doth the Lord with vs in theſe

Sacramentes. For by Baptiſme doeth he
admit vs to his ſeruice, and by the Supper
doeth he feede vs, that wee periſh not with
hunger. So that where wee ſee theſe Sacramentes
duely adminiſtred, without any
inuentions of mans witte or brayne, the one
with the word and water, the other with the
worde, and bread and wine, without other
ſuperſtions and additions, there we may
acknowledge the Church of Chriſt to bee
preſent, and he in the middeſt of them, according
to his worde, as hee hath promiſed,
Where two or three are gathered together
in my name, there am I in the middes of
them, Matth. 18. Now theſe Sacraments
are in ſome thinges vnlike. Concerning
the firſt, which is Baptiſme, it is to bee
vſed but once of a Chriſtian man or woman,
and not often: as the Iewes vſed but
once to circūciſe their children, which Circumciſion
was a ſigne of our Baptiſme,
which we haue in ſteade of it: ſo this Baptiſme
of infantes is not to bee iterated.
For euen as a man is borne but once, ſo
once baptizing is ſufficient, to ſignifie
our newe byrth in Chriſt. Therefore they
were ouerſeene, which woulde haue it to
bee iterated and done agayne, as Saint

Cyprian was in that errour. The other
Sacrament muſt bee often vſed of euery
Chriſtian man and woman, as the Iewes
vſed many times and often, euery yeere to
eate the Paſchall Lambe or Paſſeouer: ſo
muſt wee alſo often reſort to the Lordes
Table, but ſtill with reuerence, repentance,
and faith to eate and feede ſpiritually
vpon Ieſus Chriſt his body and blood.
For this Sacrament came in the place of
the Paſſeouer: ſo that as they remembred
their comming and deliuerie from the
bondage and thraldome of Egypt and
Pharao by this Lambe: In like ſort muſt
wee remember by this Sacrament our redemption
by Chriſt from the deuill and
hell, from the ſlauery of ſinne, whereof
the Iewes deliueraunce both in Egypt and
Babylon, were moſt liuely ſignes and
figures vnto our eyes, to beholde that
which Chriſt hath done for vs in dying
for our ſinnes vpon the croſſe, that wee
might bee made righteous in him, 1.
Corinth. 1. Nowe the oftener wee remēber
this which is done, eſpecially in the
Communion, the better it is for vs, alwaies
remembring this, that wee come thither

with examination of our ſelues, as the Apoſtle
willeth, leaſt we come to iudgement
and condemnation. This then is not to be
done at Eaſter onely, as the blinde cuſtome
of the Papiſts was, but at other times alſo,
except they wil make it ſufficient for a man
to eate once in a yeere, to feede his bodie:
wherefore as we often vſe to eate corporall
and earthly foode to feede the body, which
otherwiſe would ſtarue: ſo muſt we frequēt
this Supper, which is holy, many times &amp;
often to feede our ſoule, which is more neceſſary
then the feeding of the body: and the
meate of the one muſt bee had, and a great
deale ſooner then the prouiſion of the other,
I meane, of the body, which is but mortall.
Theſe are the outward ſignes, whereby the
Church of Chriſt may bee knowen from
the temple of idoles. I am not ignorant that
there are other ſignes, as the holy Ghoſt,
and faith, which becauſe they are inwarde,
and knowen to God, and euery mans owne
conſcience, I let them paſſe, I onely ſpeake
here of the viſible ſignes and markes of the
church, whereby it is manifeſted vnto men,
ſuch as the worde and Sacramentes be. If
then theſe be the ſignes of true Chriſtians,
let vs that are Engliſh men, vſe them diligently,

let vs in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon
heare the worde, &amp; with reuerence embrace
it, &amp; let vs withal confirme it in our hearts,
as with a ſeale, by the reuerent receiuing of
the ſacraments of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt.
This ground being layde, that the Church
is knowen by the worde of Chriſt, and his
Sacramentes beyng vſed as hee ordayned
them, we can not acknowledge the Church
of Rome to be this Catholike Church of
Chriſt: for ſhee hath not theſe markes in her
forehead. For it is moſt manifeſt, that ſhee
hath burned this worde of Chriſt in the fire,
and refuſed it, and in ſteade of it ſette vp the
worde of man, the decrees of Popes, and
conſtitutions of their owne, as the liues of
Saintes in their Legende, which is full of
abominable lies: they mainteyne their own
traditions aboue this worde, and haue them
in greater eſtimation: ſo that the neglect
of their owne trumpery, as to eate fleſh in
Lent, or to breake their faſting dayes, is
more ſeuerely puniſhed by them, and made
a greater matter then the open contempt of
Gods Lawes: For the adulterie of their
Prieſtes, Friers, and their Nunnes, was
counted but a light matter, &amp; no ſinne with
them. Here we ſee what all the worlde may

iudge of them, and theſe thinges to bee
true, experience it ſelfe doeth teſtifie. And
if at any time they gaue the people the
worde, which is called of Paul the ſworde
of God, wherewith all Chriſtians ought
to fight, and therefore ſhoulde be common
as well to the laytie as the Cleargie, as
they tearme them: If, I ſaye, they gaue
it at any time vnto them, yet they gaue
it as a ſworde in the ſheath, that is, in the
Latine tongue, wherein they vnderſtoode
nothing at all, contrarie to the expreſſe
wordes of Paul, ſaying, That all thinges
ſhoulde bee done to edification in the
Church, and that hee had rather ſpeake
fiue wordes in a knowen tongue, then
fiue thouſande without the vnderſtanding
of the people, 1. Corinth. 14. I ſaye theſe
men are guyltie of the death of the Lordes
people, which ſende them out to fight with
their enemies, and yet take awaye their
weapons and ſwordes from them, and ſo
leaue them naked and bare to the ſpoyle
of the enemie. This did the Churche of
Rome, when it firſt tooke away here with
vs the ſcriptures and worde of God in Engliſh
from the people, and fedde them with
toyes &amp; fables of Beuis of South Hampton,
                     
and ſuch like fabulous bookes, which were
inuented by the deuils inſtruments to keepe
the people from reading of the holy Scriptures.
And no maruayle if they did ſo, that
is, take away the worde from them: for they
knewe well ynough, that if the people had
the Scriptures in their owne tongue, they
woulde quickly ſee and perceiue their knauery
and treacherie, that they ſo cloſely vſed
in corners. But when they had put out
the candle, they played many ſluttiſh
partes, and no man ſawe them, although the
Lorde then winked not at them, but hath
in his good tyme diſcloſed them to their
ſhame, his name be prayſed therefore. We
ſee then, that this falſe church of Rome hath
dealt with the Scriptures and the people,
as the Philiſtins handled Samſon, for they
put out his eyes, and then they led him whither
they woulde: ſo the Papiſtes, when
they had ſubtilly put out the eyes of the people,
in taking from them the light of Gods
worde, and the Goſpell of Chriſt: they
brought them where they liſted, &amp; made thē
beleeue what they woulde. They thought
good to be ill, &amp; ill good, they called ſweete
ſowre, and ſowre ſweete: light darkeneſſe,
and darkeneſſe lyght: and all becauſe

they had not the word, which was the true
light vnto their paths, and a lanterne vnto
their feete, Psal. 119. Then was it altogether
thought good and godly to goe on pilgrimage,
to offer to Saintes, to praye to
them, to haue images in Churches, to beare
candles, to kiſſe the Pax, to goe on proceſſion,
with a thouſand ſuch trumperies, which
we were delited with, as yong children in
toyes and trifles: whereas now we willingly
cōdemne them, and are aſhamed of them,
becauſe we haue the light, which hath made
them manifeſt, and ſheweth vnto vs, that we
henceforth be no more children, wauering &amp;
caryed about with euery winde of doctrine,
by the deceite of men, and with craftineſſe,
whereby they lye in wayte to deceyue vs:
But let vs follow the trueth in loue, and in
all things grow vp into him, which is the
head, that is Chriſt, Ephes. 4. ver. 14. &amp; 15.
By theſe thinges we ſee, that Rome is not
the true Church, becauſe it hath forſaken
the worde of God, whereby the Church is
gathered together, as men to battell, by the
ſound of a drumme or trumpet. Nowe as
they haue done in the word in mangling it,
ſo haue they in like maner corrupted and altered
the true vſe of the Sacramentes, both

in adding vnto them, and taking away from
them, not being contented with the ſimplicitie
and that order that Chriſt vſed them in.
To Baptiſme haue they added of their
owne, ſpittle, creame, and ſalt, with ſuch
like traſh: the cuppe haue they taken away
from the common people, and ſay it was ordayned
for the Prieſtes onely, when as our
ſauiour Chriſt ſayde, Drinke ye all of this,
Matth. 26. They ſay, not al, but the Prieſts
onely: ſo that when Chriſt ſayth one thing,
they ſay another contrary vnto it. Furthermore
they worſhip the bread, and ſay that it
is turned into the bodie of Chriſt, &amp; become
God, where they commit both idolatrie, in
worſhipping a creature, as the bread, and
blaſphemie, in that they ſay it is God. Seeing
then they haue not theſe marks for their
church, let vs ſee what markes they ſhewe
vnto vs. Firſt they ſay that their Vniuerſalitie
or multitude, is a ſigne of the Catholike
Church: but this is vtterly falſe, confuted
both by the teſtimonies and authorities
of the ſcriptures, and alſo by many examples
out of them. For firſt, if multitude
make the Catholike Church, then the
Turkes and Pagans ſhall be the Church,
ſooner and before the Papiſtes, as the euent

doeth ſhew, for they are moe in number then
the Chriſtians, or their pretended Catholikes,
which yet I thinke they will not
graunt to be the Church. But they will ſay,
Among the Chriſtians the greateſt number
are the Church. If this be ſo, then ſayde
not our ſauiour Chriſt truely, when hee
called his Church a little flocke, ſaying:
Feare not little flocke, for it is your fathers
pleaſure to giue vnto you the kingdome,
Luke 12. He ſhoulde haue ſayde, great
flocke, according to the Papiſtes opinion.
Againe, when one aſked our ſauiour
Chriſt, whether there were fewe that
ſhoulde be ſaued: hee anſwered in effect
that it was ſo, ſaying, Striue to enter in
at the ſtrayte gate, for many, I ſaye vnto
you, will ſeeke to enter in, and ſhall not
be able, Luke 13. Here Chriſt ſayeth flatly,
that many, that is, the multitude, ſhall
not enter in at heauen gates, which yet
notwithſtanding muſt bee ſaued, if the
Church, as the aduerſaries ſaye, conſiſt
of multitude, for the Church ſhall bee ſaued.
Here Chriſt excludeth multitude from
his Church and kingdome, and in the 7.
of Matthewe, wee ſhall ſee that hee maketh
paucitie and the ſmall number to bee

an argument of his Church, quite contrarie
vnto the blinde Papiſtes, ſaying,
Strayte is the gate, and narrowe is the
way that leadeth vnto life, and fewe there
be that finde it. Are there fewe that finde
this gate? then are there but fewe of this
Church of Chriſt. Wherefore wee haue
the more neede to watche, to ſtriue, and to
contende to be of this ſmall companie, for
ſurely many are called to the Goſpell, but
fewe, and very fewe are choſen. But let
vs ſee the examples of the holy Scripture.
Was not Noah onely founde righteous
with his houſholde before the Lorde, when
the flood was brought in vpon the wicked
worlde? For all fleſh had corrupted his
way before God, Genes. 6. Was the greateſt
multitude in Sodome founde to be of
this Church of God? Surely if it had
bene ſo, Sodome had not bene deſtroyed.
But there were not ten righteous men to
bee founde within it, onely Lot with his
wife and two daughters eſcaped the fire,
all the reſt were wicked, and therefore moſt
fearefully cōsumed with fire and brimſtone
from heauen, to make others to feare th
                        •
                     
like ſinnes, as Saint Peter ſayeth, Gen.
19. 2. Peter 2. There came but two into

the promiſed lande of Canaan of all the ſixe
hundred thouſande men, beſide women and
children, that came out of the lande of Egypt,
and they were Ioſua and Caleb: the
reſt iuſtly periſhed in the wilderneſſe for
their vnbeliefe and diſobedience. But let vs
ſee further, when this Church was more
increaſed in the times that followed. Was
not Elias onely againſt the foure hundred
falſe prophetes of Achab and Iezabel? 3.
Reg. 18. And did not he thinke, that there
had bene none aliue that appertayned vnto
the Lorde, but he onely? And although the
Lorde ſayd vnto him, that he had reſerued
vnto himſelfe ſeuen thouſand, that had
not bowed the knee to the idole Baal: yet
was that to the multitude and number of
y• wicked that were then in Iſrael? Againe,
was not the kingdom of Iſrael farre
greater then the kingdome of Iuda? and yet
was the true worſhippe and ſeruice of the
Lorde onely with the Iewes in Ieruſalem,
and not in Dan, or Bethel, where were the
golden calues of Ieroboam? Was not Micheas
in his time onely one Prophete that
was good, againſt foure hundred lying prophetes
of Achab? He was ouercome there
by multitude, and yet hee had onely the

trueth and worde of the Lorde on his ſide,
3. Reg. 22. If wee liſt to come neerer the
time of Chriſt vnder the Goſpell, we ſhall
ſee the feweſt to holde with him. Was not
the whole multitude of the Iewes with
the chiefe Scribes, and Phariſes, and hye
Prieſtes againſt Chriſt, and condemned
him to death: crying, Crucifie him, crucifie
him, Iohn 19. Afterwarde in the ſucceſſion
of the Church, wee ſhall ſee the
Chriſtians to bee the ſmalleſt number. Vniuerſalitie
then and multitude, is no argument
of the Catholike Church of Chriſt:
but rather the contrarie may bee affirmed,
the leaſt number to be his. Secondly they
will haue Antiquitie to bee a note and token
of this Church: If they will ſtande
to Antiquitie, and long preſcript and continuance
of time, euen here alſo muſt they
needes fall. For their Maſſe with her reliques
was neuer heard of within the ſpace
of fiue hundred yeeres at the leaſt after
Chriſt, as a godly and learned man
doeth auouche vnto them, which if they
coulde prooue: he woulde haue ſubſcribed
vnto them: and their tranſſubſtantiation
was neuer ſpoken of, before the Council of
Lateran: and ſo all their trumpery hath bene

patched together by Popes and Councils
at diuers times. Whereas wee can prooue
our holy Communion euen from Chriſt
and his Apoſtles, vſing it in the ſame order
with bread and wine in a knowen tongue,
as he did to his Apoſtles. If their Maſſe be
of ſuch great antiquitie, as they beare vs in
hande, it is great maruayle that the very
name of it can not once be founde or read of
in the Scriptures: but it is an vnknowen
name, for an vnknowen thing. Here we ſee
antiquitie doeth confute them, although antiquitie
be not alwayes a good argument,
to prooue a matter by. For if it were, then
murder ſhoulde be good, which is as auncient
as Cain the ſeconde man that was
here vpon the earth. Gen. 4. From the firſt
king of Iſrael, which was Ieroboam, (after
that the kingdome was deuided in Solomons
time) vntill the laſt king of the
ſame kingdome, which was Hoſhea, the
golden calues were ſtill mainteyned, which
were erected firſt of all by Ieroboam, and
continued for the ſpace of three hundred
yeeres, or there about. And yet for all
this, was not their religion good, although
they receyued it ſtill by tradition &amp;
cuſtome from their fathers, by the preſcript

of ſo many yeeres. For the Prophetes
notwithſtanding did ſtill reprehende
the idolatrous and wicked kinges for their
ſuperſtitious worſhipping of theſe calues,
which they ſhoulde not haue done, if the
argument of our Papiſtes bee good, to
bring and alleadge their forefathers, cuſtome,
traditions, Councils, and antiquitie:
for then Achab might haue ſayde vnto
Elias, if this be true, why doeſt thou
reprehende me for this worſhippe? I haue
receyued it from the firſt king Ieroboam,
and my fathers haue liued and dyed in it,
and I haue antiquitie to pleade for mee.
But Elias knewe well ynough that this
was no argument, and therefore tooke him
vp ſharpely, as we may our Papiſtes, although
they haue had their Maſſes theſe
ſeuen or eyght hundred yeeres. Agayne,
if antiquitie or cuſtome bee a generall
rule to confirme a doctrine in religion,
then myght the Pagans and Ethnikes
haue alleadged agaynſt the Apoſtles theſe
thinges, when they came to preache Chriſt
Ieſus crucified vnto them, and to alter
their olde religion, wherein they had
continued ſo long. Wee ſee then that

antiquitie fauoureth them not at all, neither
yet can they father their Church and religion,
which they haue at Rome, vpon the ſucceſſion
&amp; ordinarie deſcent of their Biſhops
and Popes, ſeeing trueth goeth not by ſucceſſion
&amp; inheritance, but by the grace and
mercy of God. But if ſucceſſion of biſhops,
and hie Prieſtes, as they fayne, from Peter
to this time, doeth prooue the Church by a
lineall deſcent to be with them: why then
ſhould not the hye Prieſts in Chriſtes time,
as Annas, and Caiaphas, &amp; Ananias in the
time of the Apoſtles, be the true Church? for
they had their ſucceſſion from Aaron the
firſt hie Prieſt, ordayned by God himſelfe,
and might haue obiected this to Chriſt, and
did alſo, their lineall deſcēt from Abraham:
and yet they were of the ſynagogue of Satan,
&amp; Chriſt doeth call them blinde guides,
generation of vipers, hypocrites &amp; fooles,
and doeth not take them for his Church, but
whippeth them all out of it rather. We ſee
then, that ſucceſſion is nothing to prooue
the Church by: for then the Scribes,
Phariſes, and hye Prieſtes ſhoulde haue
bene of the Church in Chriſtes time. They
obiect furthermore a generall conſent and
agreement, to prooue the Church vnto vs:

but we know that a conſent and agreemēt
without God and this worde, is rather a
conſpiracy, then a conſent. But to cut off
this viſour alſo in a worde, was not there a
general cōſent of al the people of y• Iewes,
with the chiefe elders alſo, the Scribes, the
Phariſees, the hie prieſts with Herode and
Pilate, in the time of Chriſt, to condemne
him, &amp; to crucifie him? For Luke reporteth
ſaying, Thē al the multitude cried at once,
ſaying, away with him, and deliuer to vs
Barabbas, and the voices of them, and of
the hie prieſtes preuailed, Luk. 23. Behold,
here was a whole and vniuerſall conſent &amp;
agreement, and yet for all that, it was againſt
the trueth, euen Ieſus Chriſt the author
of al trueth. But do they agree among
them ſelues? are they not at variance yet
what purgatorie ſhould be? ſome appointing
it to be fire, ſome water, ſome iſe and
ſnowe? Were not the Dominican friers againſt
the Franciſcans about the conceptiō
of the virgin Marie deuided? Are they agreed
about the matter of the ſacrament,
ſome holding that he is there onely in qualitie,
ſome in qualitie &amp; quantitie too? Doe
they agree in the number &amp; order of their
Popes and biſhops? (Platina differing frō
                     
Euſebius, ſome appointing mo, and ſome
leſſe? Are not fathers againſt fathers, and
councils againſt councils, &amp; Popes againſt
Popes? a
                        ••
                      
                     regorie againſt them all, in
the name of the vniuer ſall biſhop, which he
iuſtly thinketh to be ye name of Antichriſt?
And yet ſhall we thinke they doe agree, or
that they can not erre, or that theſe things
aboue rehearſed, as multitude, antiquitie,
with cuſtome, conſent, traditions, ſucceſſion,
ancient fathers, generall councils, are
ſufficient proofes of the church to bee with
them: Councils haue erred, and bene contrary
one to an other: for the coūcil of Cō
                        ſtantinople,
ordained that images ſhould
not be had in the church: after that, the coū
                     cill
of Nice the ſecond erected them, and
decreed that they ſhoulde bee had and worſhipped.
They alſo go about to proue their
church by the authoritie of Doctors of the
Churche: but it is manifeſt, that they
haue all erred, &amp; bin deceiued in ſome point
or other, yea euen of doctrine, ſo that they
are not to be rules &amp; notes, to knowe this
church by, for they are but men, &amp; haue now
or thē in doctrine, not only in maners ſlipped
from the truth. Ireneus, Victorinus, &amp;
Lactantius, ſubſcribed to the opinion of the

                     Millinaries, which thought that Chriſt after
the day of iudgement, ſhould raigne wt
his for a thouſand yeeres here vpon earth,
being deceiued with the place of Iohn, Reuel.
20. not wel vnderſtoode, where as hee
doth interprete that M. yeere, in another
place for euer, Reue. 22. Auguſtine thought
that all children dying without baptiſme,
were damned, which is an hereſie. Epiphanius
defendeth that it was a tradition of ye
Apoſtles ſix dayes before Eaſter, to eate
nothing but bread and ſalt. Ierom condemned
the ſecond mariages of men, and counted
them al (a thing moſt abſurde and erronious)
no better then fornication. By theſe
things then ye church is not diſcerned: neither
is glorie, pompe, honor, riches, externall
beauty, and outward ſucceſſe and happines,
any note of this church of Chriſt, as
the Papiſtes will beare vs in hande, by reaſon
of their gliſtering and glorious church
of Rome. The contrary thinges are
markes of Chriſts Churche, as pouertie,
affliction, no ſhewe to the eye, or any externall
felicitie. For Chriſt hath ſayde, his
churche ſhall be vnder the croſſe, and not in
any beauty, or gorgeouſnes to the outward
eye of the worlde. The harlot &amp; ſtrumpet

goeth moſt commonly better trimmed and
decked in apparell, then the honeſt woman
and matrone of an houſe: &amp; ſo is the whoriſh
church of Rome, it hath all things for to
pleaſe well the outward ſenſes, &amp; to allure
men vnto her. It hath for the eare, her delicate
muſicke, ſinging, &amp; piping, &amp; organs,
and ringing of bels, and this in exceſſe alſo.
It hath for the noſe, ſweet ſmels, frankinſenſe,
and ſuch like. For the eyes, it hath to
pleaſe them, goodly copes, croſſes of ſiluer
and golde, pictures of Chriſt, and many
images of ſaintes, with ſuch like baggage,
and fooliſh traſhe: and for the belly to delite
idle lubbers, and loyterers, there was good
chere kept in abbeyes and monaſteries:
but in the meane ſeaſon, what was all this
to feede the hungry ſoules? ſurely nothing.
The worde of Chriſt was then gone from
them, yea, Chriſt him ſelfe was ſhut out
with them, and his mother Marie more
ſought to, more prayed to, and more eſteemed
then he him ſelfe. Here were al things
for the body, and by this they would proue
vnto vs, that they were y• true church. Wel,
if we would know the church, let vs thinke
it to be there where two or three are gathered
together in Chriſtes name: and howe

ſhould they bee gathered together without
his word and commandement? And this agreeth
to y• ſaying of S. Auguſtine, If they
will here admit him. He that will knowe,
ſaith he, which is the true church of Chriſt,
he can not know it by any other meanes,
then onely by the ſcriptures. We ſee here
how reſolute he is in this caſe. Ex homilia
49. operis imperfecti in Matth. And againe
he ſaith, Chriſtians willing to receiue the
ſtedfaſtnes of a true faith, let thē fly to nothing
but to the ſcriptures. Otherwiſe, if
they looke vnto other things, they ſhalbe
offended, and periſhe, not vnderſtanding
which is the true church, and ſo they ſhall
fall into the abomination of deſolation,
which ſtandeth in the holy places of the
church. How we may plainely vnderſtand
what are the ſignes of the true church, and
what alſo are the bodies of the church of
Antichriſt at Rome, euen murdering of the
ſaints of Chriſt, contempt of the word and
ſacramēts, worldly proſperitie, with a multitude
of ill men with ſworde to defend it.
Furthermore, this church, that it may be
the better knowen of vs, therfore hath it diuers
and ſundry names in the ſcriptures,
leſt we ſhould be deceiued by y• falſe church.

It is called y• ſheepfold of Chriſt, doing vs
to vnderſtand, that thoſe y• belong to Chriſt
are gentle as ſheepe, &amp; not cruel as wolues:Eſaie 11.
for they ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in al the
mountayne of my holines, (ſaith the Lorde
of hoſts) by his Prophet. This name of the
church excludeth y• bloody church of Rome,
for they are as wolues &amp; cruell beaſtes, deuouring
the ſheepe, as well with vs appeared
in Queene Maries dayes, howe
bloodthirſtie they were, in that the wolues
ſlewe ſo many of the ſheepe of Chriſt. It is
called the ſpouſe of Chriſt, therefore they
that giue them ſelues to another head and
huſband, as the falſe Romanes doe, are not
of this church. It is alſo compared and likened
to the moone, becauſe the churche
taketh all her light and brightnes of Ieſus
Chriſt, the true ſunne of righteouſnes, as
the moone doeth take of the ſunne all her
light, which thing the Papiſtes doe not: for
they aſcribe not all to Chriſt, but ſome
things to the Pope, &amp; ſome to them ſelues
and others. And as the moone is not alway
viſible being in her change, ſo is not this
churche to the eye of man, alwayes in a viſible
ſhe we, as the proude churche of Rome
is, but hath ſometime warre and aduerſitie,

ſometime peace &amp; proſperitie. It is moreouer,
like vnto a ſhip vpon the ſeas toſſed
in deede with the waues from one place to
an other, but yet neuer drowned, becauſe
Chriſt Ieſus is in it, and holdeth the ſterne
with his hande. Theſe thinges, vnto the
which the church is likened, doe very well
conuince Rome to be no church of God at
all, for it is alwayes viſible to the eie, and in
great wealth and proſperitie, as Babylon
was, &amp; ſo it boaſteth of her ſelfe, as ſhee did.
It neuer at all mourneth, or is in the pit of
afflictiō as Chriſt ſaid his church ſhouldbe,
Iohn. 16. And as we reade in Ezechiel 9.
this church of Rome doth alwayes laugh
and reioyce, and neuer feeleth the rodde,
which is a token of baſtards, and ſuch reprobates,
and not of Gods children Heb.
12. This true church of Chriſt is but one:
For there is but one mediator, &amp; one huſband,
and therefore one ſpouſe, and one
body, as Paul proueth, Epheſ. 4. and is called
vniuerſall, becauſe it is in all partes of
the earth, and the Lord hath of his church
out of all nations and kinreds &amp; tongues,
Reuel. 7. Which church yet notwithſtanding,
is deuided into particular churches of
euery coūtrey &amp; kingdom, where as they al

make but one general church. For they are
ioyned together in the ſame ſpirite, fayth,
baptiſme, and Lorde Ieſus, which is one
head to them all. There was a particular
church in the houſe of Philemon, as Paul
reporteth in that epiſtle, and he alſo calleth
the Corinthiās a church, &amp; others too, vnto
whom he wrote, meaning that they were
ſpeciall churches of this vniuerſall church.
And here the ignorance of the Papiſtes is
ſeene and manifeſted, which make that to
be general and catholike, which is but particular
&amp; ſpecial. For although their Rome
were a true church, yet can it not be termed
by any meanes, Catholike, except all the
ſaintes and good men aliue vpon the earth
were in it, which can not be. Here thē they
are deceiued in the worde Catholike, making
that to bee generall, which is but in
part ſo. Paul did neuer write to any church,
which hee called Catholike, for if hee had
meant ſo, that Rome had bene the catholike
church, when hee wrote vnto it, then
could he not properly haue called Corinth
a church at all. The ſumme of all that we
haue ſaid hitherto, is thus much: that there
is an holy church, whoſe head is Ieſus
Chriſt alone, to this end and purpoſe called

of God by his woord, that it ſhould gloryfie
him for his goodneſſe. For looke whatſoeuer
our God doth, he doth it in y• behalfe of
his holy church: For this end doeth hee deſtroy
ſometymes mightie kingdomes, and
great Princes, that hee might deliuer his
church, and verily, for this ende doeth hee
keepe and preſerue ſo long this wicked
worlde, vntill the number of his elect be
fulfilled. He neuer deſtroyed any nation,
but it was for his churches ſake. Oh howe
greatly are we then bound to the goodnes
of this our Chriſt, which worketh ſo great
thinges for vs! ſhall we not magnifie his
grace? ſhal we not yeelde him continuall
thanks, and that in the middeſt of the great
congregation? Beleeue me deare brethren,
we are elect, ereated, redeemed, iuſtified,
ſanctified, preſerued dayly by his power, &amp;
ſhalbe gloryfied in the life to come, with his
holy angels and ſaintes, that we ſhould ſet
forth his praiſe &amp; glory. And this is y• thing,
which the bleſſed Apoſtle S. Peter doth in
his firſt Epiſtle the ſecond Chapter, ſo earneſtly
exhort vs vnto, ſaying,1 Pet. 2. 9. 
                     To the church
of God, the trewe chriſtians of Pontus,
Aſia, Cappadocia, Galatia, and Bithynia,
(and in them to vs all:) you are (ſayth he)

                     a choſen generation, a roial prieſthood, an
holy nation, a people ſet at lybertie. Marke
nowe, dearely beloued, the chiefeſt poynt,
to what ende all theſe thinges are done
vnto vs, that yee ſhoulde (ſayth hee)
ſhewe foorth the vertues of him that
hath called you out of darkneſſe, vnto
his marueilous light. Doe wee nowe
ſhewe foorth his goodneſſe with thankeſgiuing?
then are we good Chriſtians, and
ſerue to the ende, whereunto the Lord hath
made vs. Are wee not all carefull of this
duety, to praiſe God his name daily? Surely
we haue then tranſgreſſed, and degenerated
from the ende, of our creation
and calling. The praiſe of God is ſuch
a thing, ſo hye, and ſo excellent, that if
all the Angels in heauen, with their
force and might▪ and all the men in earth,
with all their ſpeach and eloquence, goe about
to ſet it forth and declare it, they ſhall
not do it ſufficienly, and as it deſerueth to
be done. We ought then to do what lieth
in vs: and this thing doth the triumphant
church in heauen, of Angels, and Saints,
teache vs, that we ſhould neuer ceaſe to exto
his name at al times, as they do, for they

cannot ſatiſfy themſelues with crying, Holy,
holy, holy is the Lorde God of hoſtes,
the whole worlde is full of his glory, Eſay.
6. And in the Reuelation the fourth chapter,
the foure beaſtes, and the Elders
ceaſe not day nor night, crying, Holy,
holy, holy Lorde God almighty, which
was, which is, and which is to come.
And yet for all this, wee here in earth
can ſatiſfy our ſelues, and be contented
to ſet foorth his praiſe, either neuer a
whit, or els ſo negligently and by ſuch
ſtartes, as wee declare, wee haue no
great loue and care thereunto: ſo colde is
our zeale in this poynt, and yet moſt hot
in trifles and vanites, apperteining to
our pleaſures &amp; profits in this life. Wee
haue nowe heard (dearely beloued) the
meaning of this article, concerning the Catholike
Church, what it is, and who is
the head of it, what authoritye it hath,
by what ſignes it may bee alwayes
knowē from the Romiſh or falſe Church.
We haue alſo declared, that it is called Catholike,
becauſe it is not tyed to any time,
perſons, or place whatſoeuer, but is diſperſed
euery where, as ſeemeth good to the

Lord. We haue furthermore ſhewed vnto
you, what be the markes of it, and what are
not the trewe ſignes of it, and that it conſiſteth
not in multitude of people, but in
weight of trueth. Laſt of al, we haue made
manifeſt, to what end y• Lord hath gathered
a church together vnto himſelfe here in
earth, which is, that hee may be honoured
and gloryfied in it, accordingly by their
good workes and chriſtian conuerſation.
Now let vs giue thankes to Ieſus Chriſt,
the head of this Church, in that hee hath
vouchſafed to make vs the holy members
of it, which were before the firebrandes of
hell, and a generation of Satans broode.
Let vs moreouer prayſe his name, for as
much as he doth daily preſerue vs by his fatherly
goodnes, and diuine prouidence, in
this ſheepefold of his, from all wolues and
rauening beaſtes, which otherwiſe would
deuoure vs. And becauſe he doth feede vs in
it with wholeſome &amp; greene paſtures of his
holye worde, and leadeth vs foorth to the
waters of life and comfort to refreſhe our
ſoules, let vs not be vnmindful or vnthankfull
to him, for this ſo great a benefit. Now
let vs moſt humbly pray vnto him, that he
would vouchſafe to keepe vs in this church

of his vnto the ende, leſt we wander and go
aſtray from it as loſt ſheepe, and beſeech we
him, that he would continue his graces &amp;
heauenly promiſes made vnto vs ſo liberally
in his Goſpel, that from day to day,
we may grow in holines toward him, as
becōmeth this church, vntil the time come,
that our full redemption from him ſhall
appeare. This God graunt vnto vs, not for
our ſakes, but for Chriſt Ieſus ſake, which
hath purchaſed al theſe things for vs, wt the
ſhedding of his moſt precious blood vpon
the croſſe for our ſinnes. To this Ieſus
Chriſt with the father, and the holy
Ghoſt his power, be rendred all praiſe and
glory, honour, dominion and thankeſgiuing,
both now and for euermore. Amen.
               
               
                  
                  The tenth Lecture vpon
the tenth article of our Chriſtian
fayth, which is,
The Remiſſion of ſinnes.
                  
                     IN the article going next before,
we haue heard what wee haue
to beleeue concerning y• church,
which is ye houſe of Chriſt: Now
followe the ornaments, and benefits which
ye Lord in mercy doth, &amp; wil beſtowe vpon
this houſe, which are in number three. 1. Remiſſiō
of ſinnes in this life. 2. Reſurrectiō of
our bodyes frō corruption at the laſt day of
iudgement. 3. And euerlaſting happines in
ye life to come. Theſe benefites are great &amp;
ſo ineſtimable, that wee can not worthyly
conceiue of them, being couered with fleſh
and bloud: and therefore wee are the leſſe
thankeful, then otherwiſe we ſhould be, if
we did or could deepely conſider of them:
for they are ſuch iewels, as the Lord doeth
only beſtow vpon his children, and none
els, and therefore they are put after the
Church, and communion of Saintes, as
thinges following the ſtate of the church

neceſſarily, for none can haue them, but
ſuch as abide in the church, and are true &amp;
liuely members of Ieſus Chriſt, ingraffed
into his body by faith. The firſt of theſe
graces is, the remiſſion or forgiueneſſe of
all our ſinnes. The meaning therefore of
this article for the capacity of the ſimple, in
moe wordes is this, I that am a Chriſtian
doe ſtedfaſtly beleeue, that almighty God
both hath, doeth, and will of his mercie
forgiue me all my ſinnes, both originall
and actuall committed before and after
baptiſme howe many and great ſoeuer
they be,
                     Eſa. 1. not for any woorke or merit
of mine, which am an vnprofitable
ſeruant:
                     Luke. 17. but for the ſacrifices ſake of
Chriſtes death and paſſion, wherein hee
is wel pleaſed, by whoſe righteouſnes, becauſe
I am clothed and apparelled by beleeuing
in him vnfeignedly, I am ſure and
certayne that I am deliuered from euerlaſting
death and hel, which is ye reward of
ſinne, Romanes 6. This is the playne
and ſimple meaning of this Article, and
is proued and confirmed vnto vs out
of ſcriptures, aſwel of the olde as of
the newe Teſtamēt. In the 31. of Ieremy

we reade thus, This ſhalbe the couenant
that I wil make, with the houſe of Iſrael
after thoſe dayes, ſaith the Lord, I wil put
my law in their inward partes, and write
it in their heartes, and I wil be their God,
and they ſhalbe my people. For I will forgiue
their iniquitie, &amp; wil remember their
ſinnes no more. So likewiſe, we haue the
proofe of this, in the ſecond epiſtle to the
Corinthians. Chap. 5. God was in Chriſt,
and reconciled the world vnto himſelfe,
not imputing their ſinnes vnto them. And
in the ſecond to the Coloſſians. Ye which
were dead in ſinnes, &amp; in yc vncircumciſion
of your fleſh, hath he quickened together
with him, freely forgiuing you all
your treſpaſſes. We ſee thē this doctrine to
be warranted with y• teſtimonies of the holy
ghoſt: So yt we neede not to doubt any
thing at al of it. Seeing then ye the firſt entrance
into the houſe of the Lord, is by putting
away of all our ſinnes, and becauſe
we haue nothing to do with God, except
our offences be blotted and wiped out of
his remembrāce: Let vs a litle I pray you,
(dearely beloued brethrē in Chriſt) marke
what we haue to cōſider in this article for
our inſtructiō &amp; edificatiō vnto a godly life.

We ſay here, that we doe beleeue that there
is a remiſſion of ſinnes, for the children of
God and ſeruants of Chriſt. The firſt thing
therefore that we ought to learne and beare
in minde vpon this article, is, that we confeſſe
and acknowledge moſt humbly and
meekely our ſinnes before God. For if we
ſay and graunt a remiſſion of ſinnes, wee
muſt alſo confeſſe that wee are ſinners, otherwiſe
wee can not at all haue pardon of
them. Secondly we muſt cōſider by whom
this remiſſion doeth come vnto vs, and for
whoſe ſake it is. Thirdly by what meanes
we are made capable and partakers of this
ſo great a benefite. As concerning the firſt
poynt, it is playne and euident that wee are
all of vs miſerable ſinners before GOD,
which looketh vpon the hearts of men, and
tryeth them: For who can iuſtly and truely
ſaye of him ſelfe, My heart is cleane, I am
no ſinner. Nay, Salomon doeth tell vs,
that there is not a man that ſinneth not,
1. Reg. 8. Eccle. 7. And Saint Iohn ſayeth
playnely, that if we ſay we haue no ſinne,
we doe but deceyue our owne ſelues, and
there is no trueth in vs. We are begotten,
conceyued, and borne in ſinne, we liue and
are brought vp in ſinne: and ſhall any man

be ſo impudent and ſhameleſſe, as to deny
that he is a ſinner? God forbid. The Apoſtle
ſayeth, All men haue ſinned and are deſtitute
of the glorie of God, Rom. 3. But we
neede not to goe farre for the proofe of this
matter: Our Sauiour Chriſt hath taught
his to ſay dayly and hourely, euen as long
as they liue, Forgiue vs our ſinnes or treſpaſſes,
Matth. 6. It is therefore a deuiliſh
pride and preſumption to ſay, whoſoeuer he
be, that he is no ſinner: for ſurely thē Chriſt
can not helpe him, for he came to ſaue ſinners:
And yet there are ſome in the world,
and haue bene alſo, that haue denied this:
So greatly that Satan bewitched them.
Well, if theſe teſtimonies of ſcripture did
not condemne them ſufficiently, yet I am
ſure, their owne heart &amp; conſciences ſome
time or other wil accuſe thē, and their own
mouth witnes againſt them. Iob telleth vs
this thing plainely in his booke Chap. 9. If
I would iuſtifie my ſelfe, my owne mouth
would condemne me. We ſee thē that we
are al of vs, euen the beſt, wretched ſinners:
Nowe as we are ſinners, ſo we muſt alſo
learne to confeſſe and acknowledge theſe
ſinnes, otherwiſe it is to no purpoſe, if a
man be a ſinner, and will not confeſſe it. If

a man be ſicke, and eyther doeth not, or will
not acknowledge it, hee can not lyghtly bee
healed of the Phyſitian: for he wil not ſeeke
vnto him. Except a man feele his wound, he
will not go to the Surgeon: and vnleſſe a
man be ignorant, and ſeeth the want of his
knowledge that he ought to haue, he wil neuer
deſire to be further inſtructed, but continewe
ſtill in his ignorance and blindneſſe.
Who deſireth meate, that is not hungry? or
drinke, that is not thirſtie? or clothes, that
thinketh he hath apparel ynough? My meaning
is this, It is not ynough for a man to
thinke he is a ſinner, vnleſſe he hath an earneſt
and an effectual feeling of his ſinnes in
his conſcience, &amp; that they are as an heauy &amp;
grieuous burden vnto him. Thē if he come
to Chriſt, he ſhall quickly haue remedy for
thē. For he came not to cal the righteous, y•
is, thē that thought themſelues ryghteous,
&amp; boaſted of it, for in deed there is none righteous
before him: but he came to cal poore
ſinners to repentāce. And this agreeth with
that notable ſaying of Paul, that Chriſt
Ieſus came into this world to ſaue ſinners,
wherof he cōfeſſed himſelf to be chiefe, 1.
Tim. 1. There is a notable place cōcerning
this matter in ye fourth of Luke, where our

Sauiour Chriſt, entring into the Synagogue
of Nazareth to reade and to preach
on the Sabboth day, found ye place where it
was writtē of him in ye 61. of Eſay, ſaying,
The Spirit of the Lord is vpon me, becauſe
he hath anointed me, that I ſhould preach
the Goſpel to ye poore: he hath ſēt me, that
I ſhoulde heale the broken hearted, that I
ſhould preach deliuerance to the captiues,
and recouering of ſight to the blinde: that
I ſhoulde ſet at libertie them that are bruſed,
and that I ſhoulde preach the acceptable
yeere of the Lord. This place doeth
ſhewe for whom Chriſt Ieſus is ſent and is
meete, that is, for the poore, the broken hearted,
the captiues in ſinne, ye blinde in minde,
the bruiſed in pryſon. If we feele our ſelues
to be ſuch men, Chriſt is ſent vnto vs: otherwiſe
hee is not for vs. And this is the
cauſe that made our Sauiour to keepe
companie moſt commonly with Publicans
and ſinners, and ſuch as were infected with
great ſinnes &amp; offences, as Marie Magdalene,
and Matthew, and Zaccheus: for theſe
did willingly confeſſe their ſinnes vnto
him, and ſo he cured them. But on the contrary
ſide hee refuſed the company of the
Scribes and Phariſes, the hie Prieſtes and

Doctors of the lawe, becauſe, although they
were ſinners, yea, and grieuous ſinners
too, yet they had an opinion of holines and
righteouſneſſe in them ſelues, aboue other
men, and iuſtified them ſelues before our
Sauiour Chriſt, as we ſee in the parable of
the Publicane and Phariſe that went vp
both of them to praye into the Temple,
Luk. 18. Theſe Phariſes our ſauiour ſaide,
they had no neede of the Phyſician, becauſe
they dyd not acknowledge their infirmitie
and weakeneſſe vnto him. Chriſt in deede
is meate, but for the hungry, Iohn 6. he is
water and drinke, but for the thirſtie, Eſay
55. Iohn 7. he is a refreſhing, but for them
that are loden and burdened, Matth. 11.
Doe wee giue almes at any time to a ſtout
begger, that although he haue neede, yet
wil not confeſſe it, and aſke his almes gently,
acknowledging his pouertie? No
more ſurely will the Lorde giue vnto any
ſpirituall almes, vnleſſe wee ſhall humble
our ſelues before him, with true feeling of
our pouertie and miſerie. For verely herein
we muſt all of vs bee lyke vnto beggers,
that, to mooue pitie and compaſſion, ſhewe
not the beſt thinges they haue, (if they haue
any) but the worſt, as their ragges, their

ſores, their pouertie and nakedneſſe: And
this moueth men the ſooner to pitie them.
Dearely beloued in Chriſt, the caſe ſtandeth
ſo, and no otherwiſe, betweene the Lorde
and vs. If we will get any thing, it is by
falling downe, and humbling our ſelues,
and not by vaunting of any thing that is in
vs: for he reſiſteth the proude, and giueth
grace to the humble and lowly. Do we not
ſee it ſo by experience? Is not the beſt paſture
and meddowe grounde in the loweſt
places and valleyes, and the moſt barren
grounde in the hygheſt hilles and mountaines?
So the graces of the Lorde reſt in
the lowe ſtomacke and heart, and flee from
the hye and loftie minde. Let therefore euery
hill and mountayne be layde lowe, Luke
3. A notable example of this meeke and
humble confeſſion of our ſinnes, we haue
in the Prophete Dauid, who, although he
were a King, yet when he was reprehended
and reprooued ſharpely of the Prophete
Nathan for his adulterie and murder,
ſayd, without any replying or checking
of the Prophete, moſt mildely, I
haue ſinned vnto the Lorde. And therefore
he heard incontinently that ſweete anſwere
from the Lorde, The Lorde alſo

hath put awaye thy ſinne, thou ſhalt not
die, 2. of Kinges 12. Chapter. This thing
Dauid reporteth of himſelf in the Pſalme
32. Then I acknowledged my ſinne vnto
the Lorde, neyther hid I mine iniquitie:
For I thought, I will confeſſe agaynſt my
ſelfe, my wickedneſſe vnto the Lorde, and
thou forgaueſt the puniſhment of my
ſinne. Looke in the Pſalme 51. where hee
deſcribeth the ſame more at large. This
leſſon is to be learned of vs all, that when
we commit ſinne, we ſhoulde not cloke our
ſinne as the hypocrites doe. Looke vpon
the poore Publicane, and vpon Peter: the
one confeſſed them humbly, the other wept
for them moſt bitterly. And ſurely ſo dyd
all the good men doe from time to time.
Howe often doe the Prophetes Eſay and
Daniel confeſſe their ſinnes, and the ſinnes
of the people! Did not Tobiah do the like?
and Paul him ſelfe doeth in many places
confeſſe with griefe of minde, that he was a
perſecuter of the Church of Chriſt, 1. Cor.
15. yea, that he had the relikes of ſinne ſtill
abiding in him, Rom. 7. Yea this confeſſion
&amp; acknowledging of our faults, muſt ſometime
be made to our neyghbour or brother,
if we haue offended him, and we muſt, &amp; are

commaunded to ſeeke reconciliation at his
handes, as our Sauiour ſayeth, Matth. 5.
If thou bring thy gift to the altar, &amp; there
remēbreſt that thy brother hath ought againſt
thee, leaue there thine offring before
the altar, and goe thy way, firſt be reconciled
to thy brother, and then come and offer
thy gift. And this is that thing that S.
Iames meant in his Epiſtle 5. Chap. Acknowledge
your faultes one to another,
and pray one for another, that ye may be
healed: not ſo, that wee allowe any papiſticall
ſhrift, or a vaine confeſſion of all our
ſinnes in the eare of a maſmonging Prieſt,
which can do vs no good, but rather taketh
an occaſion him ſelfe to bee ill, when he heareth
the lewde deedes of ſome. But wee
meane, that an agreement is to bee ſought
for, with ſubmiſſion one to another, if any
man be offended. Neyther doeth this place
of Iames prooue the Popiſh confeſſion, as
they woulde haue it: for hee ſpeaketh not
here of the Prieſt, but of all Chriſtians.
And if ſo bee they will haue this place to
prooue it, then muſt their Prieſt confeſſe
as well his ſinnes to the people, as the people
to him: for ſo goe the wordes of the
text, One to another acknowledge your

faultes. Notwithſtanding if any man feele
him ſelfe grieued with his ſinne, and clogged
in his minde and conſcience, if then hee
reſort to his godlie and learned Paſtor or
preacher in the pariſhe, and tell it vnto him,
to haue comfort and his aduiſe what to doe,
hee can not iuſtly for this bee reprehended of
any, becauſe it is both good and godly. But
to number vp al their ſinnes to the miniſter,
as the papiſtes woulde haue it, no man can
doe: for who knoweth howe oft hee offendeth?
as Dauid ſayth, Pſalme 19. neyther
is this thing warranted by any authoritie
or example in ſcripture. But to our
purpoſe: wee ſee then by theſe thinges, that
as we are ſinners all the ſort of vs, ſo wee
muſt not diſſemble them, if wee truely intende
to haue remiſſion of them, but with
our whole heart we ought to confeſſe them
vnto the Lorde. And here is to bee noted,
that in this article wee doe beleeue and confeſſe
a remiſſion or forgiueneſſe of ſinnes,
and not a ſatiſfaction of vs for our ſinnes,
as the aduerſaries teach, that wee muſt ſatiſfie
for our ſinnes, and purchaſe pardons
from Rome by money, by maſſes, and ſuch
trumperies, as going on pilgrimage barefoote,
by faſtings, and lying in hearecloth.

Surely if theſe things bee added to take away
our ſinnes, then is not this our article
true, which ſayth, that there is a free remiſſion
of ſinnes without paying any thing at
all of our part, euen as the detter when hee
hath nothing to pay or diſcharge his dette,
ſome godly creditour doeth freely, forgiue
him. Nowe if hee ſhoulde pay any thing, or
halfe of it, then it is not freely forgiuen, but
partly forgiuen, and partly payde: but Iohn
pronounceth, that if any man thirſt, he may
come and take of the well of the water of
life freely, Reuelation 20. 22. Eſay 55.
If wee may take away any of our ſinnes
by ſatiſfying for them, then all is not due
to the blood of Ieſus Chriſt: but Iohn
ſayth, that it is the blood of Chriſte and
no other thing that doeth purge vs from
all our ſinne. Wee with all our merites
and good deedes can not ſatiſfie Gods
wrath and anger, conceiued for one of the
leaſt of our offences: for the leaſt ſinne that
we committe, deſerueth euerlaſting hell
fire: and howe then can wee ſatiſfie, except
wee bee freely forgiuen? This Dauid
well vnderſtoode, ſaying, If thou, O
Lord, ſtraitly markeſt iniquities, O Lorde,
who may ſtande? but marke what Dauid

addeth, and it confirmeth our poſition and
purpoſe: but mercie (ſaith hee) is with thee,
that thou maieſt be feared, Pſal. 130. Hee
declareth vnto vs ſufficiently, that wee can
not bee iuſtified before the moſt pure God,
but by forgiueneſſe of ſinnes: and therefore
pronounced that man bleſſed that had
his ſinnes forgiuen, not that had ſatiſfied for
them. Our ſauiour doeth teach his to pray
in humilitie, Forgiue vs our ſinnes, and not
to ſay, Giue vs grace or might to ſatiſfie for
them. Thus much for the firſt poynt, that
if wee will haue pardon of our ſinnes, wee
muſt firſt confeſſe and acknowledge them:
for what ſhould God forgiue vs, if we were
not ſinners? The ſeconde thing to conſider
in this article, is to knowe to whome to
come vnto for the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes,
and for whoſe ſake they are remitted, otherwiſe
to knowe and beleeue a remiſſion of
ſinnes, is in vaine: for as it is booteleſſe for
a man that is very hungrie, to knowe and
beleeue there is meate in the worlde, except
he knew the place &amp; the man that had it for
him, that he might reſort vnto him: and as
it is in vayne to confeſſe thy diſeaſe and
ſickenſſe, vnles thou know ſome good Phyſicion
who may helpe thee: ſo ſurely it ſhall

profite vs nothing at all to knowe or to confeſſe
our ſinnes, if wee bee ignorant of the
mediatour that ſhould take them away: yea,
if the ſicke perſon ſhoulde ſeeke out ſuch a
Phyſition, as either could not or would not
cure him, his labour alſo were vnprofitable,
and all one, as if the needy man ſhoulde goe
to one for an almes, that is as needy as hee
him ſelf. Let vs therefore take diligent heede
to this, that being ſicke of our ſinnes in our
ſoules, we goe and runne to ſuch a cunning
Phyſition, as we are ſure both can and will
for his abilitie and compaſſion cure and
heale our infirmities, and hath a ſalue for euery
ſore and maladie. This cure and Phyſicke
for all diſeaſes, reſteth not in any creature
whatſoeuer, no not in the Angels: for
they neede a mediatour to holde them al vp,
not in the Saintes: for eyther they are all
ſinners, as thoſe aliue here in the earth, or
els haue bene all ſinners, as they in heauen,
and therefore neede a mediatour as well as
wee. There is no creature therefore in this
great cure of ſinnes, that can doe vs any
good: nay rather wee ſhall be woorſe and
woorſe, runnyng to them, as the woman in
the Goſpell was with the iſſue of blood, ſeeking
vnto Phiſitions, vntill ſhee came to

Chriſt, who cured her immediatly, Luke 8.
for he is only the good Phyſition, that came
to cure our deadly woundes, Matthewe
9. Will yee then knowe who this is that
onely forgiueth ſinnes? Marke what the
holy Ghoſt ſaith, Ioh. 1. Behold the lambe
of God that taketh away the ſinnes of the
worlde. Who is this onely lambe of God,
but Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of GOD, ſlaine
from the beginning of the worlde for the
ſinnes of the people? for there is but one
mediatour betweene God &amp; man, ye man
Ieſus Chriſt, 1 Timo. 2. and he hath giuen
him ſelfe a ranſome for all. If this bee ſo,
we may boldely come vnto him at his commaundement,
eſpecially when hee calleth,
Come vnto mee all yee that doe labour
and are laden, and I will refreſh you, Matt.
11. The whole ſcriptures both of the newe
and olde teſtament doe propounde no other
redeemer vnto vs, then Ieſus Chriſt. All
the ſacrifices were figures of remiſſion of
ſinnes by Chriſt alone: for it was vnpoſſible
(as the Apoſtle ſaith,) that the blood of
goates and calues ſhoulde take away ſinne:
but yet ſinnes were taken away vnder the
lawe. It remayneth therefore, that they
ſhoulde bee taken away by Chriſt: for Abraham

reioyced to ſee his day, and ſawe it
gladly, Iohn 8. There was but one temple,
but one hie prieſt, but one altar: ſo there is but
one Chriſt to men, to take away ſinnes: for
all theſe thinges were ſhadowes of him.
He is the true temple, in whome wee muſt
pray, the hie prieſt that offereth his body for
vs, and the true altar, vpon whom we muſt
offer all our ſacrifices of prayer and
thankeſgiuing, if wee will haue them to
pleaſe God, and to be accepted of him. Wee
haue (ſaith the holy ghoſt) an altar (meaning
Chriſt:) whereof they haue no authoritie
to eate, which ſerue in the tabernacle, meaning
the vnbeleeuing Iewes. Let vs therefore
by him offer the ſacrifice of praiſe alwayes
to God, that is, the fruite of the lips,
which confeſſe his name, Hebrews. 13.
Our ſauiour Chriſt, when he ſent forth his
apoſtles to preach, willed not them to preach
remiſſion of ſinnes, but in his name onely,
Luke 24. and this doeth Peter in the Actes
declare vnto vs chapter 10. Through his
name euery one ye doth beleue, ſhal receiue
remiſſion of ſins. Healings of ye body were
done &amp; wrought in his name by y• Apoſtles,
Actes 5. and therefore the clenſing and curing

of the ſoule, which is by remiſſion
of our ſinnes, is much more to be looked for
at his hands. And as it was in Egypt, in the
great dearth and famine of corne, none could
haue any food of Pharao the king, but by the
hāds of Ioſeph, whō he had made ouerſeer &amp;
ruler of the land in his name (for when they
cryed to him for breade, he ſayde, Goe yee
to Ioſeph, and what he ſayth to you, do ye,
Geneſis 41.) ſo it is nowe in the famine and
dearth of our ſoules for ſpirituall foode, we
can haue nothing to feed our hungry ſoules
from the king of heauen, but by the meanes
of the true Ioſeph, which is Ieſus Chriſt,
who is ordeined of his father to rule and
gouerne all thinges in his name, ſo that
hee ſendeth vs to his Sonne, when wee
aſke any thing of him, for in him hee is wel
pleaſed, and for his ſake onely and for no
mans elſe, doeth hee beſtowe this benefite
vpon vs: for GOD hath in
deede giuen lyfe vnto the worlde, but
this lyfe is in his Sonne, that all ſhould
honour the Sonne, as they honour
the Father. And as among the Iſraelites
none coulde bee healed that were
ſtung of the fyerye Serpentes, but all

ſuch as looked vp to the braſen Serpent
which Moſes made: ſo it is as certaine, that
none can bee deliuered from the ſtinging of
the olde ſerpent which is the deuill, but they
that looke vp to the ſonne of God on hie in
heauen, they haue redemption by his blood,
that is, the remiſſion of ſinnes, Epheſians 1.
There is no other name vnder heauen,
wherein we muſt be ſaued, no other fundation,
whereupon wee muſt builde vp into
heauen, no other ſtone that coupleth the
building together, no other key that openeth
heauē gates vnto vs, but Ieſus Chriſt,
Reuelation. 5. Except therefore we beleeue
that it is he that taketh away all our ſinnes,
wee ſhall die in them, Iohn. 8. Neither is
this doctrine onely confirmed vnto vs by
the authorities of the worde, but alſo by the
examples of all the godly. Dauid was ignorant
in the way of the Lord, but to whom
doth he goe for knowledge? Teach me, O
Lorde, (ſaith hee) the way of thy ſtatutes,
Pſalme 119. Neither ſhall ye reade, that he
went at any time to any other, in that his
whole booke of prayers &amp; thankeſgiuings,
ſaue onely to the Lorde: he did knowe well
ynough, that all other ſcholemaſters were
vnlearned and domme, and as Idoles that

could not ſpeake. The woman of Canaan
went at ye firſt to Chriſt, to haue her daughter
cured. Saint Paul praied to the Lorde,
to haue the meſſenger of Satan to depart
from him, 2. Cor. 12. Neither can there be
any example brought of any, that euer he
went to any other then to the Lord onely, to
haue his ſinnes and offences taken awaye.
By this, that our ſinnes are forgiuen in
Chriſt alone, we learne yt we of our ſelues
by nature are hatefull vnto God, before we
bee reconciled vnto him by the death of his
Sonne: ſo that except he behold and looke
vpon our ſinnes in the face and countenāce
of Ieſu Chriſt, wee are but caſtawayes.
Wherefore (brethren) let vs looke vnto it,
that wee may perſwade, not men, but our
owne ſelues, not in tongue and mouth onely,
but in heart and deede, that we are ſurely
members of Chriſt. Furthermore we gather
by this, that the Papiſt, the Turke, the
Iewe, haue all gone aſtray, for they ſeeke for
remiſſion of ſinnes by other meanes, then
by the death of Chriſt. The Papiſt by his ſatiſfactorie
woorkes of his owne deuice, by
pardons from the Pope, when as no man
can forgiue ſinnes, but God onely: by his
praying to Angels, to Saints, whome he

maketh interceſſors and mediators to God,
and ſo leaueth the waters of life Chriſt Ieſus,
and diggeth ſuch broken pittes and ciſternes,
as can holde no water at all. I ſee
not therefore howe hee can haue remiſſion
of his ſinnes, ſeeing he ſeeketh it els where
then in the blood of Chriſt, and of Chriſt
alone, for they giue ſomething vnto him,
but not all, and ſo they make him but halfe
a ſauiour. But eyther hee will bee a whole
Sauiour vnto them, that hee may haue
all the glorie and prayſe, or elſe he will be
none at all. Chriſt can not abide any thing
to be ioyned with him, in the way to ſaluation
and euerlaſting life, but he will bee
the onely and whole Sauiour to men.
The Turke that hateth this name of Chriſt,
and goeth not about to haue remiſſion of
ſinnes by it, can clayme no part in the inheritance
of the kingdome of heauen: hee
thinketh to bee ſaued by God the Father,
when hee honoureth not God the Sonne.
Agayne, he truſteth to his Alcoran, and
his falſe prophet Mahomet, and forſaketh
the true and euerlaſting Prophete Ieſus
Chriſt, whome God ſent into the worlde,
to giue life vnto it. They can ſaye, I beleeue
in God the Father Almightie, but

they will not confeſſe that which followeth
of Ieſus Chriſt the onely Sonne of
God, and therefore they are not vnder the
Couenaunt of grace and ſaluation, but
ſtande all accurſed before the lyuing Lorde,
as beyng without Chriſt. Thirdly, the
Iewes can haue or looke for no remiſſion
of ſinnes, becauſe they haue reiected this
Chriſt, and go about to eſtabliſh their owne
righteouſneſſe by the workes of the Lawe,
whereas Chriſt is the full ende or perfection
of the Lawe, for righteouſneſſe to euery
one that beleeueth, Rom. 10. They
haue a zeale, but not according to knowledge,
and thinking to bee ſaued by the
Lawe, they all ſtande accurſed, and alſo
accurſed iuſtly by the Law before the Lord,
For curſed (ſayeth he) is he that continueth
not in all thinges that are written in
this booke to doe them, Galat. 3. They
are detters then (without Chriſt) to keepe
and perfourme the whole Lawe perfitly
and abſolutely vnto the Lorde, which no
man can doe, no not they, and therefore
(without a Sauiour) they ſtande in a miſerable
caſe, euen in the ſtate of euerlaſting
damnation and perdition. And laſt of
all, the falſe and Hypocriticall Chriſtian,

which profeſſeth with his mouth, that hee
knoweth and beleeueth in Chriſt, and yet
vtterly denyeth him in his whole life &amp; conuerſation,
can hope for no remiſſion of his
ſinnes, continuing ſtill as he doeth in diſobedience,
and all kinde of abominations.
But the Lord hath dyed for ſinners you wil
ſaye, and great and notorious sinners too:
trueth it is, he hath done ſo, but yet they are
ſuch ſinners as repent and are ſory for their
former ſinnes, they lead not their life in voluntarie
ſinnes, ſo that they ſhoulde delite &amp;
dwel in ſinne: but they continue in the feare
of the Lord. Briefely, they are penitent ſinners,
and not obſtinate and wilfull perſons,
that can not repent, for whom the Lord hath
died. If we feele our ſelues to be ſuch trembling
ſinners, the Lorde hath a free remiſſion
of ſinnes for vs, whenſoeuer we come vnto
him: for to whom doth the Lord looke?
Euen to him that is poore, &amp; of a contrite
ſpirit, and trembling at his wordes. But he
that hardeneth his heart, and goeth on ſtill
in his former wickedneſſe, without remorſe
of cōſcience at al, he heapeth vp wrath vnto
himſelfe againſt the daye of wrath, and maketh
his ſinnes ſo heauie vnto himſelfe, that
they will preſſe him downe to hell. Theſe

men muſt amend their ill liues, and be heartily
ſory for their ſinnes, not in hypocriſie,
as Pharao was, who ſaid, I haue ſinned vnto
the Lorde: neither in deſperation, as Iudas,
who repented, but not in faith. But
herein let them followe Dauid in the olde
Teſtament, and Peter in the Newe, who
repented, and wept moſt bitterly, but yet in
hope, &amp; had remiſſion of their ſinnes. Theſe
men by their repentance, afterwarde changed
and altered their olde liues and conuerſation,
their olde man with his maners was
put off, and the newe man, which after God
was created in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe,
was foorthwith put on, and ſo they
walked all their dayes afterward in a newe
life. Many men can ſay now a daies: Oh, I
nowe repent, I am ſory for my ſinnes, &amp; yet
by and by, or the next daye, they fall to the
ſame or like ſinnes againe. Shal we thinke
ſuch men repent? nay verely, they deceyue
but themſelues and the worlde, for God
they can not deceiue. Repentance is in the
heart, and not in the mouth, for it is a turning
and chaunging of the minde from ill
to good. As long therefore as we ſee their
liues not to bee at all chaunged, wee may
boldely ſaye, they repent not truely, and

therefore▪ remiſſion of ſinnes is excluded
from them. Hee that repenteth truely,
altereth his wicked life, as wee ſee it came
to paſſe in Paul, who, after that hee was
called, and repented of his former life,
neuer returned agayne to perſecute the
Church of Chriſt, neyther did hee liue
as before hee did. Well, to conclude
this part, if this remiſſion of ſinnes come
vnto vs by Chriſt, let vs be ſure to bee in
his loue, let vs not profane his holy name
by our vile blaſphemies in our mouthes
dayly, as the wicked doe: but let euery
one that calleth vpon this name, depart
from all iniquitie, 2. Timothie 2. chapter.
The thirde thing to bee conſidered in this
remiſſion of our ſinnes, was as I ſayde
before, the meanes by the which it may
bee applyed vnto vs, and receyued from
Ieſus Chriſt the authour of it. For vnleſſe
wee alſo knowe this, it is to no purpoſe
to knowe the former two poyntes. And
this may bee made playne vnto vs by this
ſimilitude. The poore man that is an hungred,
although hee knowe whyther to goe
to ſome riche man or other for his meate
and almes, yet except he vnderſtand, what
meanes and waye to vſe to obtayne this

reliefe of the riche man, all is in vayne:
for if he ſhould vſe ſtoute and ſturdy words,
when hee ought to be gentle, or if he ſhould
commaunde it, when hee ſhoulde intreate
for it, hee were not like to ſpeede, or if
the riche man did offer him meate to be receyued
with the hande, and hee put foorth
his foule feete to receyue it, it were a very
prepoſterous order, and ſuch a thing
as myght iuſtly cauſe this man to withdrawe
his liberalitie from him: ſo ſurely
the caſe ſtandeth betweene our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt, the Prince of all heauenly treaſures,
and vs poore ſinners and wretches.
Albeit we well perceyue, that hee hath remiſſion
of ſinnes for vs, yet wee muſt
knowe the waye to pleaſe him, when wee
come to haue our ſute obtayned. And this
waye to pleaſe him, and to take the benefite
that hee offereth, is onely faith in his
name. For without faith it is vnpoſſible
to pleaſe him. For he that commeth vnto
him, muſt beleeue that he is, and that
hee is a rewarder of all them that ſeeke
him, as ſayth the holy Ghoſt the eleuenth to
the Hebrewes. When therefore the Lorde
Ieſus offereth this great benefite of ſaluation
vnto vs, in the free remiſſion

of all our ſinnes, wee muſt not offer out
to him our foule feete, that is to ſaye, our
woorkes, which are with many ſinnes polluted
and defiled: for ſo wee myght cauſe
him to bee angrie with vs, and to keepe
backe his gracious benefites. But we muſt
as he hath commaunded, and alwaies in the
Goſpell requireth, when he is about to doe
vs any good, beleeue onely in him, that is,
offer vnto him our hande, that is, true faith,
which is a fitte thing and inſtrument to receiue
his bleſſinges. Neyther is this our
ſaying, but the phraſe and maner of ſpeache
in the Scriptures. Our Sauiour Chriſt
did neuer any miracle or cure vpon the bodies
of men, but hee required faith of them,
and they being healed, hee alwayes attributed
it to the faith and confidence that they
had in him, and not to any good worke of
theirs. In the ninth chapter of the Goſpel
after Saint Matthews, wee reade there, of
a very charitable deede of foure men, that
brought one being ſicke of the palſie to our
ſauiour Chriſt, as hee laye on his bed: but
what ſayde our ſauiour Chriſt concerning
this? Ieſus ſeeing their faith, ſayde to the
ſicke of the palſie, Sonne, be of good comfort,
thy ſinnes are forgiuen thee. You ſee

howe that the cure of the man is aſcribed
to their faith, and not to their good workes.
Likewiſe two blinde men came vnto him
to be healed, crying, and ſaying, O ſonne of
Dauid, haue mercie vpon vs. This verily
was a good confeſſion, and worke of them,
Matth. 9. But what ſayeth hee vnto them?
Beleeue ye that I am able to doe this? they
ſayde, Yes. Then ſayeth he, According to
your faith be it vnto you. The woman that
was deliuered from the bloodie yſſue, heard
this of him: Daughter, be of good comfort,
thy faith hath made thee whole, Matt.
9. When he rayſed vp the rulers daughter,
he required but onely faith of him, which
thing the Papiſtes ſaye, we can not prooue
out of the Scripture. In the eight of Luke
therefore this worde onely is put, to exclude
all other things: for (ſaith he) Beleeue only,
&amp; ſhe ſhalbe ſaued. Now if Chriſt require
this faith in the cure of the externall man,
that is, of the bodie, which is the leſſe thing,
hee doeth much more require it in the healing
of the inner man, the ſoule, which is
the greater cure, and of more valewe. You
haue then heard, that faith in Chriſt cureth
the body: heare nowe alſo, that Chriſt requireth
faith eſpecially to beleeue in him to

euerlaſting life. The Goſpell written by
Saint Iohn is full of this matter almoſt
in euery Chapter. Speaking of Chriſt, he
ſayeth on this wiſe, He came among his
owne, and his owne receyued him not,
but as many as receyued him, to them he
gaue prerogatiue to be the ſonnes of God,
euen to them that beleeue in his name,
Iohn 1. Againe, So God loued the world,
that he gaue his onely begotten Sonne,
that whoſoeuer beleeueth in him, ſhould
not periſh, but haue euerlaſting life, Ioh. 3.
He that beleeueth in him, is not condemned,
but he that beleeueth not, is condemned
already, becauſe he hath not beleeued
in the name of the onely begotten
Sonne of God. In the fift of Iohn, our
ſauiour ſaith, Verely, verely I ſay vnto you,
he that heareth my worde, and beleeueth
him that ſent me, hath euerlaſting life, and
ſhall not come into condemnation, but
hath paſſed from death to life. The ſixte
chapter is full of ſuch godly and comfortable
ſayings: I am that bread of life, he that
commeth vnto me, ſhal neuer hunger, and
he that beleeueth in me, ſhall neuer thirſt.
Verely, verely I ſay vnto you, he that beleeueth
in me, hath euerlaſting life. Theſe

things are written, that ye might beleeue
that Ieſus is Chriſt the Sonne of God, &amp; in
beleeuing ye might haue life through his
name, Ioh. 20. It were infinite to recite all
the places in Scripture that make for this
matter, and I ſhould be tedious, if I would
rehearſe them all. Notable is that place in
the ſixtenth chapter of the Actes of the Apoſtles,
where the Iayler demandeth of Paul
and Silas, what he ſhould doe to be ſaued:
&amp; they anſwered forthwith, Beleeue
in the Lord Ieſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaued,
and all thine houſe. I referre them that liſt
to ſee moe places, to the Actes 3, 10, &amp; 13.
chapt. Rom. 1, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11. chapters. Epheſ.
2. Out of theſe wordes wee gather
this doctrine for vs, that all the graces
and benefites of Chriſt are made ours by
faith in his blood, and by faith onely wee
take holde and laye hande vpon them, for
faith is as it were an hand, or a mouth open,
to receiue meate into the ſoule, and to feede
it. We muſt then open our hande, and our
mouth to receyue him: as Dauid ſayeth in
his Pſalmes, ſpeaking in the perſon of
God: I am the Lord thy God, which haue
brought thee out of the land of Egypt, opē
thy mouth wide, and I will fill it, Pſal. 81.

In that place the Lorde accuſeth the incredulitie
of the Iſraelites, that did not open
their mouthes in faith, to receiue his benefites
in ſuch obedience, as he powreth them
out. Againe, if faith bee the meane to bee
made partaker of Ieſus Chriſt, and to applie
him to vs, to heale our diſeaſes: then on
the other ſide, incredulitie of man is the
ſtoppe or hinderance that letteth the Lord,
to powre down his bleſſings vpon vs. This
lacke of faith doeth ſhut vp his beneuolence
and good will from vs, ſo that hee can not
open heauen gates vnto vs, and powre vs
downe his bleſſing. Of this the Prophets
complayned in the olde time, both Eſai and
Ieremie: Behold (ſayeth Eſai) the Lords
hand is not ſhortened, that it can not ſaue,
neyther is his eare heauie, that it can not
heare, but your iniquities haue made a
ſeparation betweene you and your God,
and your ſinnes haue hid his face from
you, that he will not heare, Eſa. chap. 59.
So Ieremie in his fift Chapter: Your
ſinnes haue hindered good thinges from
you. And what ſinne or iniquitie can bee
greater, or more deteſtable before the Lord,
then the ſinne of incredulitie and vnbeliefe,
euen the mother and fountaine of all other

ſinnes? This is that which the Euangeliſt
Saint Matthewe reprehendeth in the Nazarites,
euen their incredulitie: for when
our Sauiour Chriſt came among them to
preach, and teache, and to heale them that
were ſicke, as hee did in other places, they
were offended with him, and gaue him iuſt
occaſion to ſaye of them, That a Prophete
was not without honour, ſaue in his owne
countrey, and in his owne houſe. Then is
it added in the ende of the Chapter, He did
not many great workes there, for their vnbeliefes
ſake, Matth. 13. So likewiſe our
Sauiour Chriſt ſayeth to the father of the
childe that was lunatike, conſidering his
want of faith: If thou couldeſt (ſaith he) beleeue,
all thinges were poſſible to him that
beleeueth, Marke 9. And this is the onely
cauſe that barred the Iſraelites out of the
land of Canaan: For we ſee that they could
not enter in, becauſe of vnbeliefe, Hebr. 3.
No more ſhall any enter at all into heauen,
which was figured by the holy lande of promes,
which beleeue not: for Iohn ſayeth,
that all the vnbeleuing ſhal haue their part
in th
                           •
                         
                        
                           •
                        ake that burneth with fire &amp; brimſto
                           ••
                        
                        
                           •
                        hich is the ſecond death, Reue. 21.
Nowe when wee ſaye, that faith alone in

Chriſt doeth applie all his good workes
vnto vs, wee doe not ſpeake againſt good
workes, that are done of the godly here in
this life, but our meaning is, that our good
deedes doe not ſaue vs, which any man that
hath read the Scriptures indifferently, wil
graunt. Wee exclude not workes in life
and maners here before men, but wee exclude
them frō any part or portion of iuſtification
before the almightie God, in whoſe
preſence nothing is perfite, cleane or pure,
no not the ſunne, nor the moone, nor the
Angels: but onely the works of that immaculate
and vnſpotted Lambe, euen the man
Ieſus Chriſt, whoſe woorkes are all made
ours, and imputed vnto vs, as if wee had
done them, if wee doe but beleeue in him.
Good workes muſt bee done of vs, for theſe
three cauſes: firſt, becauſe God hath commanded
them, ſecondly, becauſe he is glorified
by them, as our Sauiour ſayeth
Matthewe the fift, Let your light ſo ſhine
before men, that they may ſee your good
workes, and glorifie your Father which
is in heauen. Thirdly, they muſt be done,
becauſe they profite and further our poore
neyghbours and brethren, the needy members
of Ieſus Chriſt, and in helping

them, wee helpe Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe,
Matth. 25. For ſo doeth hee account it
as done to himſelfe. You may adde to theſe
a fourth cauſe, why good workes are to
bee done, although they ſaue vs not, becauſe
they ſhall bee ſignes and tokens to
men of our faith, which is hid and within
vs, and ſhall declare that we are good
Chriſtians, euen as the tree is knowen
by his fruite: for if wee haue no good
workes, ſurely wee haue no good faith,
but a deuils faith, as Iames ſayeth, although
wee bragge neuer ſo much of our
faith. This faith doeth not ſaue, but is a
dead faith, without any workes. The true
faith that wee ſpake of before, it doeth not
ſaue vs, in reſpect of the worthineſſe or dignitie
of it, but becauſe it doeth looke vnto
Chriſt his marke or obiect, and doeth apprehende
him with his workes. The Papiſtes
ſaye, that faith alone can not iuſtifie vs,
becauſe it is vnperfect, as wee ſay workes
are, which therefore can not ſaue vs. But
we muſt vnderſtand that the reaſon is not alike:
for we may haue a true &amp; a liuely faith
in Chriſt, although it be not in euery poynt
perfit &amp; abſolute. No man can haue a perfit

faith in this life, for it doeth ſtil increaſe, and
growe in greater meaſure: but the children
of God, they haue and may haue a true faith
cleanſed from hypocriſie and diſſimulation.
And this true faith doeth iuſtifie euery one
that looketh vp to Chriſt, as well as a perfite
faith. Faith is likened to an hand, whereby
a man doeth receiue any thing. Now we
knowe by experience, that one with an vnperfit
hande, that either lacketh a finger, or
a thumbe, or that hath his hand ſore, or otherwiſe
blemiſhed, may as well with his lame
hand receiue a good and fine piece of golde
from a riche man, for his almes, as one that
hath a whole or ſounde hande: ſo may wee
receyue from Chriſt, if wee beleeue but a
litle, as much as a grayne of muſtard ſeede
in quantitie, wee may receyue remiſſion of
ſinnes, and all other benefites of his death
and paſſion, as well as he that hath a ſtronger
faith and a greater. And nothing ſhall
be vnpoſſible vnto vs, as Chriſt ſayde to
his diſciples in the like matter, Matth. 17.
Nowe faith is ſayde to bee a firme and
a conſtant aſſent of the minde to the
wordes of God, wrought by the motion
of the holy ghoſt for the ſaluation
of all the beleeuers. Seeyng then ſo

many excellent thinges are giuen vnto
vs, if wee abide faithfull, and beleeue in
the Lorde: and ſeeing furthermore on the
contrary part, wee are depriued of all theſe
promiſes and giftes, if we haue no faith: it
behoueth vs to looke about, and to examine
well our ſelues, our hearts, our cōſciences,
our inwarde parts and affections, to ſee
whether we be in this faith or no, and whether
we cā vnfainedly perſuade our ſelues
before the Lorde, that wee haue this true
faith in Ieſus Chriſt: If we haue it, let vs
continue and abide in it to the end, that we
may be ſaued: let vs vſe the godly meanes
and exerciſes of Chriſtianitie, whereby it
may increaſe and waxe ſtronger in vs: let
vs frequent the hearing of ſermōs, and the
worde of God, in reading it alſo priuatly,
and let vs ioyne prayer to the Lord, for this
excellent gift of faith. Likewiſe, the ſacraments
are to be vſed, which are an increaſing
of this faith vnto vs, but with reuerence
let vs often vſe them. Finally the cō
                     pany
and ſocietie of the godly ſhall helpe
much to this matter. For as faith is gotten
by theſe meanes, ſo is it continued in vs,
and is loſt, if theſe exerciſes bee away. If
any feele him ſelfe voyde of faith, let him

beſeeche the Lord Ieſus, the author of faith
and giuer of it, and ſay with the Apoſtles,
Lorde increaſe my faith, and let him vſe ye
wayes that I ſpake of euen now, for faith
commeth by hearing of the word of God.
which when we heare, the holy Ghoſt worketh
in vs: yea, the holy Ghoſt it ſelfe then
commeth into our heartes by hearing the
worde, as it is reported in the Actes, that
while Peter ſpake, the holy Ghoſt fell on
all them that heard the worde. Actes 10.
                  This fayth is our wedding garment, &amp;
without it, wee ſhall be excluded and ſhut
out from the marriage of the Lambe. It
is the oyle which we muſt alwayes haue
in our lampes in a readineſſe, againſt the
bridegrome come at midnight. As the fire
goeth out for lacke of wood, ſo is fayth
extinguiſhed in vs for lacke of the worde of
God, and earneſt &amp; hearty prayer, wherby
it is mainteyned. The Iewes were cut off
for their meredulitie. Well we ſtand yet by
faith: let vs take heede, leaſt in thinking
we ſtande, we fall. If the true and naturall
oliues were not ſpared, how ſhal we eſcape
that are the wilde oliues, if we prouoke the
Lord? Theſe things although partly they
haue bene touched already, yet they cannot

be ſpoken of too much, ſeeyng they are the
dueties of of all Chriſtians, &amp; the cōmandemēts
of the Lord. This doctrine of faith in
Chriſt Ieſus, yt we are iuſtified by it alone,
&amp; by it obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes without
the works of ye law, is not priuate to ſome,
but cōmon to al that do vnfeynedly beleeue
it, whether they be rich or poore, prince or
begger, bond or free, Iew or Gētile, in this
countrey or that, al are one in Chriſt Ieſus
who is brother to all alike, and there is no
reſpect of perſons with God, Actes 10.
which is a father alike to all that call vpon
him in faith and trueth. This, as it is ioyfull
and comfortable to all, ſo is it moſt
ſpecially to all them that are afflicted in
minde, to them whoſe calling is but baſe
and abiect in the worlde, to ſuch whom the
worlde maketh no account of, briefly to all
that are in pouerty and miſerie, forſaken of
the worlde for Chriſtes ſake. Neyther is
this doctrine new or ſtrange as the aduerſaries
doe falſely ſlaunder it, which ſay it
was neuer heard of before the time of Luther:
It is not ſo, this doctrine is as ancient
as the Prophets of God are, &amp; all they are
witneſſes vnto it, and was in the primitiue
Church taught of the Apoſtles. For what

els do we ſay, but that we receiue remiſſion
of ſinnes through faith in Chriſtes name?
And doth not S. Peter in ye 
                     Actes the tenth
chapter ſay the very ſame, and confirmeth
it by the teſtimonies of all the Prophetes?
Marke his wordes wel, for they proue our
purpoſe, and confirme the three points that
we haue ſet downe in this article, firſt, yt we
al are ſinners, ſecōdly, yt Chriſt doth forgiue
thē freely, &amp; thirdly, y• by faith it is, we lay
holde on this remiſſiō. His words are theſe,
euery one of them very effectuall: To him
(ſaith hee) meaning Chriſt, of whom hee
made that excellent ſermon, going before
vnto the captaine Cornelius, giue all the
Prophets witneſſe, that through his name,
all that beleeue in him, ſhal receiue remiſſion
of ſinnes. Peter doeth ſhewe that this
doctrine which wee teache, is not newe or
hereticall, but catholike, and ſuch as the
Prophetes them ſelues all long agoe did
teache, that by fayth in Chriſt, euery one
that beleeueth, ſhall haue pardon of all his
ſinnes, whether they be committed before
or after baptiſme, whether they be actuall
or originall, or whether they be in thought
or in worde, or in deede: if wee beleue ſtedfaſtly,
they ſhall all bee forgiuen vs for

Chriſts ſake. I ſpeake here nothing of that
great and horrible ſinne againſt the holy
Ghoſt, which is irremiſſible: I hope in the
Lorde, wee ſhall neuer haue any thing to
doe with it, and therefore I will not intreate
of it, or what it is. Let this bee our
comfort, that wee that haue any feare of
God, any loue to Ieſus Chriſt our ſweete
ſauiour, any reuerence to heare his bleſſed
worde and Goſpell, and to receiue his holy
ſacramentes: we (I ſaye) that haue any
motion to theſe thinges, are farre off from
this ſinne, and it ſhall not come nere our
dwellings. You haue heard nowe (dearely
beloued) what it is we haue to learne and
beare away vpon this article, what is the
meaning of it, what partes of doctrine it
doeth conteine in it. This article, and the
beliefe of it is very comfortable, yea, the
ioyfulleſt thing of all others in this life, is
to heare of the remiſſion of ſinnes, and
that of all, when the leaſt of them is able
to plucke vs downe to hell, and there to
holde vs in chaynes of darkeneſſe for euer
and euer, without any hope of recouery,
were it not for his mercies in Ieſus
Chriſt. The Lorde doeth in deede beſtowe
dayly many good and great bleſſings vpō
                     
vs in his mercy, for the which wee ought
continually to thanke him: but this benefite
of the waſhing away of all our ſinnes
in Chriſtes blood, doeth as farre paſſe and
excell them all, as either the Diamonde
doeth the ſtone in the ſtreate, or els the
pureſt and fineſt golde that may bee, the
filthieſt droſſe and durt that can be founde,
ſo great a grace is it, in Chriſt freely to
haue all our ſinnes wiped out of Gods
remembrance. But nowe let vs giue (as
wee are dieply bounde) moſt humble and
hearty thankes to God the father, for ſending
Ieſus Chriſt his ſonne into ye worlde,
to take vpon him our ſinnes, and to beare
them all away in his body, and let vs withall
thanke this good and bountiful ſauiour
Ieſus Chriſt, for vouchſauing to humble
him ſelfe ſo farre for our ſakes, as to haue
our ſinnes imputed vnto him, and to bee
layde vpon his backe, and to ſuffer the puniſhment
dewe for them all. And let vs
alſo pray both night and daye vnto him, to
take them away from vs more and more,
and to kill this raging ſinne within vs, by
the ſcepter of his holy woorde, and operation
of his mighty ſpirite, that notwithſtanding

ſinne be in vs, as it ſhall be to the
laſt daye, yet it may not reigne in vs, or be
a tyrant ouer vs, but that we may mortifie
it from time to time, vntill wee come to
that ſtate, wherein it ſhall bee cleane put
awaye, and altogether deſtroyed, which
will bee when we ſhall meete together in
the ioyfull and happy reſurrection of our
bodyes, whereof we are to ſpeake in the article
following. Theſe thinges the Lorde
God graunt vnto vs al for his ſonnes ſake,
to whome with the holy Ghoſt, be rendred
all prayſe and glorie, and thankeſgiuing,
both nowe and for euer more. Amen.
               
               
                  
                  The eleuenth article of
our Chriſtian faith, and the eleuenth
lecture vpon it,
which is,
The reſurrection of the body.
                  
                     IN the fourth part of this our
Chriſtian beliefe, which was of
the church, I declared that there
were three conſequents or benefites
annexed vnto it. The firſt you haue
heard, which was the remiſſion of ſinnes:
Now doth enſue ye ſecond, which is the reſurrection,
or riſing againe of our fleſh and
bodie. And this article doeth folowe in very
good and apt order after the former: for as
by the firſt Adams ſinne and ours, our bodies
became mortall &amp; ſubiect vnto death:
ſo hauing remiſſion of our ſinnes by Chriſt
the ſecond Adam, our bodies ſhal hereafter
be made immortall, &amp; raiſed from death to
an euerlaſting &amp; better life thē that, which
we ſhould haue had in Paradiſe, if Adam &amp;
we had cōtinued in our ſtate of innocency.
This reſurrection is the repairing and the
renuing againe of the whole man to a
moſt bleſſed and perfite eſtate of lyfe.

The meaning therefore of this article is
thus much: I that am a Chriſtian, do moſt
certainely beleeue, that not only my body,
but the bodyes of all men, that euer haue
bene from the beginning of the world to
the end of it, ſhall at the laſt day of iudgement,
by the power of Chriſt at his comming,
be rayſed vp againe, (being the ſame
in ſubſtance, but not in qualities) whether
they be rotted in the graue, or burnt in the
flaming fire, or conſumed of beaſtes, or
drowned in the ſea, &amp; deuoured of fiſhes, or
els of birds. And I moreouer beleeue, that
they ſhalbe ioyned to their ſoules inſeperably,
at the which reſurrection the godly
ſhall haue a full ende of all their miſeries,
and paynes here; with full poſſeſſion of eternall
life, and that the wicked and reprobate
ſhall goe into euerlaſting hel fire,
which is prepared for the deuil and his angels.
This is the true ſenſe and meaning
of this article of the reſurrection. Now let
vs ſee what good leſſons may be gathered
out of it, for our inſtruction, that wee
may the better profite in the way of true
godlineſſe, and Chriſtianity. Three things
are to be cōſidered in this reſurrectiō. Firſt
that according to ye ſcriptures, there ſhall

one day be a generall reſurrection of good
and bad. Secondly, to what ende this ſhalbe.
Thirdly, the conſolation and comfort,
that wee may reape and inioy by this reſurrection,
in the applying of it to our owne
conſciences. I am not ignorant, howe that
very many thinges muſt be repeated here,
which haue bene ſpoken of before, both in
the article of Chriſtes reſurrection, which
is a playne confirmation and proofe of this,
and alſo in the other artice of his cōming
agayne to iudgement, which ſhalbe then
when this article ſhalbe fully accompliſhed
vnto vs. Theſe thinges are ſo incident
the one to the other, I meane Chriſtes reſurrectiō,
and his iudgment and our riſing
againe, that they cannot 
                        •
                     e ſeparated: howbeit,
we will by Gods grace ſo ſpeake of
them all, as they ſhall tend to godly edification,
and to the great comfort of all them
that do nowe in theſe laſt and dangerous
dayes mourne in Zion. And albeit ſome
places and reaſons ſhalbe nowe brought
here, in ye proofe of this article which haue
ben alleaged before: yet it ſhall not be amiſſe
to beare them againe and often, that
wee may the better remember them, becauſe

wee are all dull in hearing, and
forgetfull of good thinges, ſo fickle is
our memorie. In the Scriptures both
in the Lawe and in the Prophetes, and
alſo in the newe Teſtament, yee haue the
ſame leſſons giuen foorth often vnto you,
eſpecially in the Pſalmes, where the latter
part of the verſe, is either but a repetition,
or els a more playne declaration
of the former part of the ſentence.
Yea, Saint Paul him ſelfe well vnderſtoode
this to bee a very profitable and
good thing, to heare one leſſon many
tymes, and therefore ſayde to the Philippians,
It grieueth mee not to wryte
the ſame thinges to you, and for you it
is a ſure thing, chapter 3. Seeing this is
ſo, let vs then come to our purpoſe, which
is to proue that there ſhall bee a generall
reſurrection of all men. This article is (I
graunt) very harde to bee beleeued, if wee
iudge of it by fleſh &amp; blood only, as farre as
naturall reaſon will extende, but where
fayth is planted, there reaſon hath no
place. And all the woorkes of God, if they
did not paſſe our reaſon and capacitie,

then they were there not ſo wonderfull,
neither ſhould theybe vnſearcheable or paſt
finding out, which S. Paul the Apoſtle affirmeth,
Romanes. 11. ſaying, O the deepeneſſe
of the riches, both of the wiſedome
and knowledge of God! Many of the better
ſort of the heathen Philoſophers, as
Plato, Ariſtotle and Cicero, although they
were fully perſwaded of ye immortality of
ye ſoule, yet they neuer did ſo much as once
dreame or thinke of the immortalitie, and
reſurrection of the fleſhe, which we beare
about with vs. So incredible a thing did
it ſeeme vnto them. And therefore Saint
Paul, when hee came to Athens, and there
preached Chriſt Ieſus vnto them, and many
other good poyntes of Chriſtianitye, &amp;
of our fayth, they heard him indifferently
without any mocking at al: but when he
ſayde and affirmed conſtantly vnto them,
that God had appoynted a day, in ye which
he wil iudge the worlde in righteouſneſſe,
by that man whom hee hath appoynted,
wherof he hath giuen an aſſurance to all
men, in that he hath rayſed him from the
dead, thē they mocked, becauſe they heard
of ye reſurrection from the dead, Actes 17.

Well, notwithſtanding al this, we that are
Chriſtians and trayned vp in the ſchole of
Chriſt our maſter, muſt beleeue this point.
For ſurely the ful perſwaſion of this one
article, comprehendeth many other articles
of our fayth: For if wee riſe not agayne,
then is not Chriſt riſen: if Chriſt be not riſen,
then are we in our ſinnes, and ſo the
former article that went before, falleth to
the ground. But if this be true, then all ye
other going before are confirmed, and out
of doubt. Let vs therefore heare, and marke
alſo ſome infallible teſtimonies, and authorityes
of the euerlaſting &amp; true word of
God, to builde our fayth vpō in this ſo hard
&amp; ſtrange a matter to reaſon, &amp; to confirme
vs againſt all tentations of Satan, or of
the wicked and carnal Atheiſts, which wil
goe about to vndermine the veritie of this
article. We haue in the third chapter of the
booke Exodus, a manifeſt proofe of the
reſurrection in theſe woordes, where as
God ſpeaking to Moſes, ſayeth on this
wiſe, I am the God of Abraham, the God
of Iſahac, and the God of Iacob. Which
woordes are ſo forcible, that our ſauiour
Chriſt vſed no other argument agaynſt the

                     Sadduces which denied this reſurrection.
For God cannot be ſayde to be God of Abraham,
except he raiſe him againe, and the
bodye be ioyned to the ſoule. For he calleth
not himſelfe, the God of Abrahams ſoule,
but of Abraham, meaning the whole man.
It was euident therefore that Abraham
with ye reſt of ye fathers, ſhal riſe againe. Very
excellent is ye place of Iob, in the nineteenth
chapter of his booke. I knowe
(ſayeth he) that my redeemer liueth, and
he ſhal ſtand the laſt on the earth, and
though after this skinne wormes ſhall
deuoure this body, yet ſhall I ſee God in
my fleſh, whom I my ſelfe ſhall ſee, &amp; my
eyes ſhall behold, and none other for me,
though my reines are conſumed with
in me. We ſee by this, that Iob long before
vs, or before the newe Teſtament
was written, had a full hope of the reſurrection,
that both body and ſoule ſhould enioy
the preſence of God at the laſt day.
this is written (as Paul ſayeth) for our inſtruction,
that wee ſhoulde haue the like
hope and aſſurance as hee had, in the
happie and bleſſed reſurrection of our
bodyes after death. This truſt and fayth
had the Prophet Dauid, in the ſixteenth

pſalme, Thou ſhalt not leaue my body
in ye graue, neither ſhalt thou ſuffer thy holy
one to ſee corruptiō. In ye ſix and twentieth
of Eſay we read thus, Thy dead men
ſhall liue, euen with my body ſhall they
riſe. Awake, and ſing yee that dwell in
duſt, for thy dewe is as the dewe of
herbes, &amp; the earth ſhal caſt out the dead.
What can be ſpoken more playnly for
this purpoſe. Likewiſe vnder the viſion of
the dry bones, which reuiued and tooke
fleſhe, the Lord would ſhewe vnto Ezechiel,
that he was able to doe all thinges, and
to bring the people out of captiuitye, which
were as dry bones then rotten and conſumed.
And this was a type of the reſurrectiō
to the houſe of Iſrael in their baniſhment,
being reſtored to their countrey agayne.
That place of Daniel in the twelft of his
propheſie is moſt euident, At that tyme,
ſhal Michael ſtand vp, the great prince,
which ſtādeth for the children of thy people,
and there ſhalbe a time of trouble,
ſuch as neuer was ſince there began
to be a nation vnto that ſame time, and at
that time thy people ſhalbe deliuered, euery
one that ſhalbe written in the booke▪
and many of them that ſleepe in the

duſt of the earth, ſhall awake, ſome to euerlaſting
life, and ſome to perpetuall
ſhame and contempt. And they that be
wiſe, ſhall ſhine as the brightneſſe of the
firmament: and they that turne many to
righteouſneſſe, ſhall ſhine as the ſtarres for
euer and euer. Here is ſet foorth the riſing
of all men, both good and bad, &amp; the glorie
of the one ſort, and ye ſhame and confuſiō of
the other. Looke Matthew 22. Marke 12.
Luke 20. Our ſauiour Chriſt exhorting
rich men to make feaſtes, and to prouide for
the poore, ſayde, that they ſhould be recō
                        penſed
in the reſurrection of the iuſt, Luk.
14. Where we may note, that the reſurrection
is ſayde to be a recompence and a rewarde
for the iuſt. And ſurely ſo it is: for otherwiſe
ye Lord might ſeeme to be vniuſt,
which many times doeth not here reward
the Godly, as he hath promiſed, nor puniſh
the vniuſt, as he hath threatned them. And
if we truſt in Chriſt only in this life, we are
(ſayth Paul) of all men moſt miſerable.
We hope therefore for another life, and
this is in the reſurrection: this is our ioy &amp;
comfort. I ſee then no cauſe why mē ſhould
be ſo ſory to dye, and depart frō this world,
ſeeing a better world is kept in ſtore for thē.

I come to the newe Teſtament. In the 6
of Iohn our Sauiour hath a notable place
to confirme this matter vnto vs. Our Sauiour
in that place ſpeaketh of both the reſurrections,
the one from ſinne in this life,
in the 25. verſe, that the dead ſhould heare
his voyce, that is, they that were in minde
and fayth dead, ſhould nowe heare his Goſpel,
and be renewed vnto repentance, and ſo
liue a newe life. This ſeemed a ſtrange doctrine
to the Iewes, and they wondered all
at it. Our Sauiour then goeth farther with
them, &amp; telleth them of more ſtrange things
then theſe, ſaying, Maruell not at this: for
the houre ſhall come, in the which all that
are in the graues, ſhall heare his voyce, and
they ſhall come foorth, that haue done
good, vnto the reſurrection of life, and they
that haue done ill, vnto the reſurrection of
condemnation. Martha a woman was wel
perſwaded of this article, for ſhe did beleeue
that her brother Lazarus ſhoulde be rayſed
vp at the laſt day, Iohn 11. Againe, if all
nations ſhall bee gathered together before
Chriſt, then all ſhall riſe, that they may bee
iudged: otherwiſe he can not be ſayde to be
the iudge of quicke and dead. Neyther doth
the remayning of ſome aliue till the latter

day hinder this poſition, but that all ſhall
riſe. For they that dyd neuer die, ſhall bee
rayſed vp with newe bodies, which change
ſhall be as the ryſing from the dead, for hauing
weake and corruptible bodies, they
ſhalbe glorified and made heauenly bodies.
If we conſider the power of God whereby
he is able to do all things, euen what he liſt,
and greater thinges then wee can imagine:
then this will not ſeeme hard or abſurde vnto
vs. We doe beleeue and confeſſe, that he
is almightie in the firſt article, and therfore
we muſt needes confeſſe that hee can doe it,
as eaſily as he rayſed vp the bodie of Chriſt,
wherein he hath giuen the aſſurance of the
whole Church. And he that made al things
of nothing at the firſt by his onely worde, is
able alſo nowe to bring to paſſe that of duſt
and earth ſhall bodies be rayſed vp againe.
Saint Paul coulde not bee brought from
this perſwaſion by any meanes, eyther by
feare or diſpleaſure of the Sadduces, or of
Agrippa: or Feſtus, but he proteſted, that
he had hope towarde God, that the reſurrection
of the dead, which dyd ſeeme an
incredible thing vnto thē, Act. 26. ſhoulde
bee both of iuſt and vniuſt, Act. 24. The
hope of this reſurrectiō made Saint Paul,

as it ſhoulde doe vs, to do his duetie roundly:
for herein (ſaieth he) I endeuour my
ſelfe to haue alwayes a cleare conſcience
towarde God, and toward men. For verely,
for this cauſe doe many men make ſhipwracke
of fayth and conſcience in their actions
and affayres of this life, becauſe they
haue quite forgottē this day of ye reſurrection,
wherein an account muſt be giuen, not
onely of wicked deedes and blaſphemous
wordes, but of euery idle worde ſpoken,
as our Sauiour ſayeth, Matth. 12. If wee
woulde conſider this, howe wee muſt all
ſtande naked before the hie tribunall ſeate
of Chriſt Ieſus, it woulde ſurely make vs
to tremble &amp; to quake euery veine and ioynt
in vs, when we thinke vpon it. The day ſhal
be fearefull and terrible, I hope there is no
man among vs that doubteth of the certaintie
of this day, although the day and houre
it ſelfe be knowen to no man. And this is to
make vs alwayes to be in a readineſſe for it.
For it ſhal come vpon a ſudden, 1. Theſ. 5.
I ſhould be long and ouer tedious, and not
ſeeme to write a Lecture to exhort &amp; teach,
but rather a treatiſe to conuince the aduerſarie
and wicked, if I ſhoulde recken vp all
the places that here myght be brought for

the confirmation of this doctrine. Let theſe
therefore for this time ſuffice: and if the diligent
reader be diſpoſed to ſee moe, let him
reade the 15. Chapter of the firſt Epiſtle to
the Corinthians, there he ſhall haue a goodly
diſcourſe &amp; handling of this whole matter
of ſet purpoſe, Paul prouing the reſurrection
by many reaſons, both diuine and
humane, and ſhewing moreouer with what
qualities, conditions and properties the
bodies of the faythfull ſhall be rayſed vp:
where he alſo anſwereth the obiections that
may bee made to the contrary. I conclude
this part with the wordes of Saint Paul to
the Philippians the thirde Chapter: Let
our conuerſation be in heauen, frō whence
we looke for the ſauiour, euē the Lord Ieſus
Chriſt, who ſhall change our vile bodie,
that it may be faſhioned like vnto his
glorious body, according to the working
whereby he is able euē to ſubdue al things
vnto him ſelfe. In theſe words he ſheweth
that Gods power is able to doe this, and
although our bodies bee vile, they ſhall bee
made fayre againe: trees ſeeme to be dead
and rotten in the winter, which in ye ſpring
time come forth moſt floriſhingly with their
fruite in due ſeaſon: ſo it is in the reſurrection.

This made the fathers ſo carefully to
burie the dead with their balmes &amp; odours,
knowing they ſhould appeare againe. Laſt
of all, I referre you to the 2. Pet. 7. Chap.
&amp; Reue. 20. where this reſurrection is moſt
liuely, as in a table before your eyes, deſcribed.
It followeth in the ſecond place, to ſee
to what ende this great reſurrection ſhall
be. We haue ſeene the efficient and chiefe
cauſ of this reſurrection, to be the power
of God mightily woorking in him ſelfe.
The fourme of it is, the ioyning and vniting
together of the body &amp; ſoule for euer:
and the matter wherein this doeth ſtande, is
the ſoule and body of man, which muſt bee
repayred againe, being once corrupted by
ſinne in our firſt grandfather Adam, and alſo
in vs his children, ſpringing of the ſame
corrupt roote with him. The finall cauſe
why this reſurrection ſhall bee, is of two
ſortes: the one is in the reſpect of the good
and godly men, who haue liued here in
the feare of the Lord, to his honour and glorie:
in theſe he will ſhewe his exceeding
great mercie, in making them veſſels of honour
to ſerue him, whome he will rewarde
with euerlaſting life, which yet notwithſtanding
they haue not of duetie deſerued,

(as the Papiſts ſay) but in mercie doeth the
Lorde beſtowe it vpon them. The other
cauſe is in reſpect of the wicked and reprobate,
vpon whom the Lorde will ſhewe his
perfite iuſtice againſt ſinne and wickednes,
cōmitted of thē without repentance. Theſe
will hee make veſſels of his wrath, which
ſhal burne in thē with an vnquenchable fire,
without ende and mercie, who becauſe here
they haue not bene throughly puniſhed, or
ſometimes not at all, therefore the full meaſure
of their puniſhment is reſerued til that
great day, then to be powred out vpon them
in fire and brimſtone, in that burning lake
continually which neuer ſhall haue ende.
For theſe cauſes is this reſurrectiō (whereof
wee ſpeake) ordayned. To ſpeake of the
end for the godly, firſt, ſo it is that the Lord
hath promiſed in mercie to reward all his
faythfull ſeruants, which commeth not manie
times to paſſe in this life, therefore there
remaineth a life to come to be ſhewed in the
reſurrection of the fleſh. And if all godlineſſe
bee ſure to bee recompenſed with a
promiſe of a good turne in the life to come
(as Paul declareth to Timothie the firſt
Epiſtle and fourth Chapter) Then out of
all doubt very expedient and neceſſarie it

is, that there ſhoulde be a reſurrection. If
any man ſay. The ſoules of the faythfull are
rewarded as ſoone as they depart from the
bodie, with this promiſe of life, and therefore
they ſeeme not to lacke a rewarde, although
there be no reſurrection, and ſo
God is true of his promiſe: I anſwere, that
as the bodyes of the faythfull while they liued
well here, haue bene temples of the holie
Ghoſt, to ſerue the Lord withall, and as
not onely in ſoule, but alſo in body through
diuers tentations and perſecutions they
haue bene afflicted for Chriſt, and haue
ſtill bene vnder the croſſe: ſo ſurely, they
alſo with the ſoule ſhall be glorified and rewarded,
according to the things that they
haue done. And to this agree the wordes of
the holy Apoſtle: We muſt all (ſayeth he)
appeare before the iudgement ſeate of
Chriſt, that euery man may receyue the
things which are done in his body, according
to that he hath done, whether it bee
good or euill, 2. Corin. 5. Here he nameth
expreſly the body, otherwiſe the rewarde
were vnperfite, if in one part onely it were
beſtowed. The Lord will not ſuffer the giuing
of a cuppe of colde water to his ſaints
to goe vnrewarded, much more therefore

will he rewarde thoſe that haue giuen their
bodies to be conſumed in the flames of fire
for his cauſe and the Goſpel: ſo that if any
loſe his life for his ſake in this worlde, he
ſhall finde it in the worlde to come, with an
hundred fold more, with all happineſſe and
ioy reſtored vnto him. If we looke vpon all
the ſaints that haue bene from time to time,
we ſhall ſee that they had no felicitie, nor
happineſſe in this life. The Epiſtle to the
Hebrewes, ſpeaking of the excellent fayth
of the olde Patriarkes and ancient fathers,
ſheweth vs what was their eſtate in this
life, for their good woorkes and deedes:
Some were racked and woulde not bee
deliuered, others were tryed by mockings
and ſcourginges, by bandes and
impriſonment, they were ſtoned, they
were hewen aſunder, they were tempted,
they were ſlayne with the ſworde, they
wandered vp &amp; downe in goates skinnes,
and ſheepes skinnes, being deſtitute, afflicted
and tormented, wandring in wilderneſſes,
and mountaynes, and dennes
and caues of the earth. If we aſke the end,
why they ſuffered and endured ſuch things
of the wicked, the ſame Apoſtle doeth make
vs anſwere, This they did, that they might

receiue a better reſurrection. And ſurely
they had bene fooles to endure ſuch tormēts
of body, if the body and ſoule had periſhed
in their death and graue, as doe the bodies
of bruite beaſtes, without any hope of the
reſurrection. Conſider ye the Apoſtles, how
they were rewarded here for their preaching
and godly life: did they not all for the moſt
part, in the ende ſuffer death and martyredome
for their labour? howe was Paul rewarded
of the Lorde in this life? did hee not
whippe and ſcourge him when hee receiued
him for his ſonne? yes truely. And he confeſſeth
what his whole life was after his
conuerſion: nothing but a ſea of troubles
&amp; miſeries, fightings without, and terrours
within, hunger and thirſt, colde, nakedneſſe,
bandes and pouertie were the rewardes
that the Lorde gaue him here, inſomuch,
that hee might ſeeme to be in worſe caſe after
his conuerſion to Chriſt, then before, if
hee had iudged of his afflictions by a worldly
and carnal eye, and not according to faith,
as did carnall Demas, and therefore becauſe
hee felt miſeries in this life, in Chriſtianitie
reuolted from Paul, and embraced this preſent
euill worlde, 2. Timothie 4. Theſe
things made Paul to ſay, that vnleſſe there

were a reſurrection, his ſtate had bene moſt
miſerable of al others, for what (ſaith hee)
aduantageth it me to ſuffer theſe things, if
the dead riſe not agayne, then let vs eate
and drinke, and liue in pleaſure. So we ſee
the hope of the reſurrection ſtayed him from
running into condemnation with the wicked,
&amp; he confeſſed els where, that his crown
was not here in this life, but was layde vp
for him. And al theſe vexations of the bodies,
of ſoules, of mindes and conſciences of men,
is to teach them that no bleſſedneſſe is to bee
hoped for in this our vale of miſerie: but
we looke for a citie to come, whoſe builder
and maker is God, ſeeing wee haue none
here that is permanent. Our ſauiour, when
he comforted his diſciples agaynſt perſecutions
to come, when as they ſhoulde bee
mocked, reuiled, taunted, yea and killed for
his ſake, willed them in that day to be glad
and to reioyce, for their rewarde was great
in heauen. Hee ſaid not in earth, that their
mindes might be wt drawen frō this life to ye
euerlaſting reſt out of this world. And this
can not be, but in the reſurrection of our bodies.
They yt will haue their reward in this
life, in ſhort &amp; tranſitorie pleaſures of ſinne
for a ſeaſon, feaſting &amp; ſporting them ſelues

in their wantonnes &amp; vngodly delites, &amp; are
impatiēt to looke &amp; wait for ye heauenly promiſe
of ioyes, that ſhal haue no ende, are
like vnto the rich man both proude and gluttonous,
that fared deliciouſly euery day, and
went in purple and ſilke, not regarding the
poore eſtate of Lazarus, and therefore nowe
in hel receiueth paine &amp; puniſhment endles,
which in his life time receiued pleaſure &amp; cō
                     fort.
But they yt with paciēce, &amp; quiet minds
can take al things in good worth, whether it
be ſicknes or pouertie, or ſhame &amp; ignominie,
which ye Lord here ſendeth to thē in this life,
for a trial of their faith, &amp; can looke vp vnto y•
celeſtial life to come, tarying the Lords leaſure,
theſe men are like to poore Lazarus,
which in deed in his life time receiued paine,
but is now comforted beyond all mās expectation
wt an euerlaſting comfort, Luke 16.
Dauid pronounceth thē 
                     bleſſed that feare ye
Lord, &amp; yet if we reſpect ye preſēt time, it doth
not ſo appeare to vs, but rather ye contrary:
for what bleſſednes is here, either in ye body,
or in ye ſoule, if we ſpeake of a ſounde &amp; perfit
happines, as he meāt it? The ſoule is infected
wt ſinne, the vnderſtanding is darkned, &amp;
the things we know not are moe in number,
then ye things we know: ſo yt our knowledge

which ſhould beautifie and adorne out ſoule,
is vnperfect: and this not onely in thinges
naturall and ciuill, but alſo in heauenly myſteries,
and matters of greateſt waight &amp; importance:
ſo that Paul might well crye out
and ſay, O mortall man that I am, who
ſhall deliuer mee from the body of this
death. Rom. 7. No happineſſe therefore in
this life of the minde of man, but that which
is, is rather a ſhadowe and a viſour, then
any true ſight of happineſſe. For it doeth
not yet appeare what we ſhal be, although
nowe we are the ſonnes of God: but this
ſhall appeare when Chriſt ſhall come in
glory, Coloſ. 3. Now if any griefe of mind
which is inwarde, come to the ſoule, then it
ſeemeth to bee in hell, and this dolour ſurmounteth
all the paſſions and paynes of
the body. Let any man conſider the bodie,
and he will ſay that it can not bee happie in
this life: the diſeaſes and ſickneſſes of it
are ſo many in number, that they haue paſſed
the arte and ſkil of the beſt Phyſitions to
heale them. And if the diſeaſes of the body
were away, yet were there calamities a
thouſand to proue it to be in a very wretched
caſe, as longe as it is ſubiect to ſinne in
this pylgrimage. What croſſes are ſhame

to vs, &amp; ignominie, contempt and reproche,
which cauſe many moſt deſperately to hang
themſelues? What is pouertie with her children?
as lacke of friendes, meate and drinke,
want of apparell which is neceſſarie, lodging,
and houſe roome, with ſuch thinges?
Theſe miſeries a man may haue, although
hee had health of body, although yet theſe
thinges bring ſickenes with them commonly.
What then are other externall dangers,
as the wounding and hurting of our ſelues,
the ſpoyling of our goods, dangers vpon
the land of theeues, &amp; vpon the ſea of drowning?
and if we ſcape that, there is danger of
vngodly Pirates. Theſe croſſes being
layde together, and weyed in the balance of
iuſtice, wil coūterpeiſe &amp; ouerweigh al our
pleaſures that are, or may bee inuented in
this life: ſo great is the heape of miſeries in
this life. And theſe troubles that I haue aboue
rehearſed, as they are common to all,
ſo eſpecially to the godly, to make them not
to bee in loue with this worlde, ſeeing the
Lorde hath reſerued the bleſſed reſurrection
for them. Wherefore (dearly beloued) call
now to remembrance the dayes that are paſſed,
and conſider the ſayntes, which after
they had receiued light, endured a great

fight in afflictions, as our martyrs did in
Q. Maries dayes, partly while they were
made a gazing ſtocke, both by reproches &amp;
afflictiōs being toſſed to &amp; fro, &amp; ſuffered wt
ioy the ſpoyling of their goods. And knowe
you deare brethren, that ye haue in heauen a
better and a more induring ſubſtance then al
the golde &amp; ſiluer of princes. Caſt not away
therefore your confidence which hath great
recompence of reward in this day of the reſurrectiō
of your bodies. For ye haue neede
of patience, that after ye haue done the will
of the Lorde, yee may receiue the promiſe of
eternall life. For yet a very litle while, and
Ieſus Chriſt the authour of this reſurrection
that ſhall come, will come, and will not
tary. Thus much for the ende of this reſurrection
in reſpect of the ſeruantes of Chriſt,
which then, and not before ſhall fully be rewarded,
and made perfitely bleſſed in euery
part, both body and ſoule, wherein they haue
ſerued their Lorde faythfully, when they
were aliue. Nowe let vs ſee the ende, for
the which all the wicked ſhall riſe againe
at that day, which alſo ſtandeth with the
iuſtice of the Lorde, to recompence them
after their demerites. As not onely the
ſoules of the wicked haue offended their

GOD by their ſinnefull thoughtes and
cogitations, but alſo their bodyes haue
bene ſlaues vnto ſinne, and haue giuen
their members ouer to ſerue vnrighteouſneſſe:
ſo it ſtandeth with equitie, that not
onely their mindes and conſciences be tormented,
but alſo their bodyes, by the which
they here haue wrought all theſe abominations,
ſhould feele the rewarde &amp; ſtipende of
ſinne, which is the euerlaſting death, euen
the ſeconde death of the ſoule and body together.
This puniſhment is deferred moſt
commonly in this life, and who in ſo good
eſtate, as concerning the bodie here, as the
wicked and ſuch as contemne the Lorde:
In ſo much that their proſperitie &amp; wealth,
haue moued the godly to wonder at the ſecret
iudgements of ye Lord in this their caſe.
This thing mooued the Prophete Habakkuk
to crye vnto the Lorde for vengeance
agaynſt the wicked, being troubled with
their proſperitie and ſucceſſe. Wherefore
doeſt thou looke (ſayth hee) vpon the
tranſgreſſours, and holdeſt thy tongue,
when the wicked deuoureth the man that
is more righteous then hee, whereof they
reioyce and are glad. Habakkuk 1.
This complaynt likewiſe made the prophet

Ieremie in his time, in the 12. of his prophecie,
ſaying, O Lord, if I diſpute with thee,
thou art righteous, yet let mee talke with
thee of thy iudgementes: wherefore doeth
the way of the vngodly proſper? why are
they in wealth, that rebelliouſly trāſgreſſe?
Theſe were Ieremies words cōcerning the
ill men: but he addeth more, Thou haſt planted
them, and they haue taken roote, they
growe and bring foorth fruite: thou art
neere in their mouth, and farre from their
reynes. Dauid founde by experience the
like ſucceſſe of the wicked in his dayes alſo,
and therefore ſaith that hee fretted at the fooliſh,
when hee ſawe the proſperitie of the
wicked: For (ſaith hee) there are no bandes
in their death, but they are luſty &amp; ſtrong:
they are not in trouble as other men, neither
are they plagued with other men.
Therefore pride is as a chaine vnto them,
and cruelty couereth them as with a garment:
their eyes ſtand out for fatneſſe: they
haue more then heart can wiſhe: they are
licentious, &amp; ſpeake wickedly of their oppreſſion:
they talke preſumptuouſly: they
ſet their mouth againſt heauen, and their
tongue walketh through the earth. Here
you haue a deſcription of their life, and of

their proſperitie, what the one is, &amp; what
the other is alſo, their life is licentious, and
yet it goeth well with them for theſe tranſitorie
goods: but what doth Dauid confeſſe
of him ſelfe, which was the childe of God?
Daily (ſaith he) haue I bene puniſhed and
chaſtened euery morning, Pſal. 73. Seeing
this ſtandeth ſo with the wicked, ſhall wee
not ſay, yt they ſhalbe puniſhed elſewhere?
Yes no doubt, there is a iudgemēt day kept
in ſtore for them, where they ſhall be puniſhed,
although they haue liued in pleaſure
here: otherwiſe the Lorde ſhould not bee
iuſt. Looke vpon the 21. chap. of Iob, and
you ſhall ſee, yt long before Dauid, he tooke
vp the like complaint, then, when he ſawe yt
wealth &amp; eaſe in this life of the godleſſe, &amp;
contemners of religion. We ſee howe the
Iewes, the children of God were ſtil afflicted
of their enemies, &amp; kept vnder the rod,
when as their perſecutors, the Aſſyrians, y•
                     Caldeans, the Perſians, the Grecians, the
Romanes, with the reſt, liued in al wealth,
peace and worldly proſperitie. It remayneth
therfore, that they one day ſhould feele
the rewarde of ſinne in their bodies which
haue ſinned: the which thing ſeldome commeth
to effect in this preſent ſtate of life.

The Lord hath ſaid by Eſaie his Prophet in
the 65. chap. Behold, my ſeruants ſhal eate,
and ye ſhal be hungry: behold, my ſeruāts
ſhall drinke, and ye ſhalbe thirſty: behold,
my ſeruants ſhal reioyce, and ye ſhalbe aſhamed:
behold, my ſeruants ſhal ſing for
ioy of heart, and ye ſhall crie for ſorow of
heart, and ſhal houle for vexatiō of minde.
Although this be ſomewhat accompliſhed,
euen here vnder the kingdome of grace,
wherby the godly do reioyce, &amp; the wicked
are ſomewhat quailed: yet ſhall it eſpecially
be ſeene in the kingdome of glory, when the
elect ſhalbe fully ſet in ſure poſſeſſion of all
ioyes, and the wicked haue full meaſure of
all their deſerued puniſhments. To end thē
this matter, the vſe of this doctrine is this:
ſeeing the wicked ſhalbe rewarded ſeuen
fold into their boſome, and ſhall make and
giue an account very ſtrait of all their
life wickedly &amp; vngraciouſly ſpent vpon ye
earth: let not vs freat at them before the
time, as Dauid counſelleth vs, neither let
vs enuy their hie &amp; ſo proſperous eſtate, for
they ſhall ſoone be cut down like graſſe, &amp;
ſhall wither as ye greene herbe. Lo, ſee their
cōtinuance, &amp; to what thing it is likened of
the holy Ghoſt, Pſal. 37. The third thing in

this reſurrection, is ye comfort that thereby
doth enſue to ye godly, when they thinke &amp;
meditate vpō it, which ſurely is very great.
For they yt are wel perſwaded in minde of ye
reſurrectiō of their bodies, can not but at ye
laſt houre of death depart ioyfully &amp; merrily
out of this life, yea &amp; deſire this day, as ye
faithful and godly do, as Paul did: I deſire
(ſaith he) to be loſed, &amp; to be wt Chriſt. The
hope &amp; great cōfort of ye reſurrection made
him to pray ſo. But they yt are not fully perſuaded
of this true article, die very vnwillingly,
&amp; with griefe &amp; ſorow of mind, thinking
they ſhal loſe all pleaſure here, &amp; inioy
none in the life to come, as the Epicures &amp;
belly gods do imagine, whoſe liues &amp; ſayings
are moſt liuely ſet forth in the ſecond
of Wiſdom, which chapter I would greatly
wiſhe to be read of all men. Againe, the
ſure beliefe of this doth comfort vs, when
we haue here loſt our deare friends and acquaintance,
becauſe one day we ſhal inioye
their company againe. So did Paul comfort
the Theſſaloniās, yt 
                     they ſhould not be
fory for them that were dead, as thoſe that
haue no hope, that they ſhal ſee thē againe:
as the heathens did, who lamēted out of al
meaſure for their friēds, as in deede hauing

no hope at al of the reſurrectiō, as we ſee it
came to paſſe in Cicero, who could not be
comforted for the death of his daughter
Tulliola, whom he loued ſo well, although
his friend Seruius wrote moſt comfortably
vnto him. The cogitation hereof doeth
arme vs againſt all perſecutions, to ſuffer
all thinges with a quiet and ioyfull mynde,
as the martyrs did endure all kindes of
tormentes in their bodies, becauſe they
knewe their bodies ſhould bee after a more
excellent and glorious ſort, reſtored to thē
againe in an other life. Furthermore, this
will cauſe vs to abſtaine from all vnlawfull
pleaſures of the fleſh and of ſinne, conſidering
we ſhall haue pleaſures in the reſurrection
without ende, and that wee ſhall
reape there ioy without wearines, if wee
faint not here. With this reſurrection did
Iob comfort him ſelfe in his greateſt extremities,
ſaying, I knowe that my redeemer
liueth, and that I ſhall ſee him in my fleſh,
Iob 19. This was the comfort of Paul in
all his perſecutions that hee ſuffered for ye
Goſpel of Chriſt, that the dead ſhould riſe
againe, ye good to glorie, ye wicked to ſhame
and reproche, 1. Cor. 15. Our ſauiour exhorted
rich men in this lyfe, to giue almes

to the poore, becauſe they ſhould be recō
                        penſed
in the reſurrection of the iuſt, Luk.
14. Eſay cōforteth ye afflicted church in his
time with hope of the reſurrection, ſaying,
Thy dead ſhal riſe, euē with my body ſhal
they riſe, Eſaie 26. And what is els the cō
                     fort
of the godly at this day in ſuch ſorowfull
times, and dangerous dayes of ſinne,
but onely the ſure hope of this bleſſed reſurrectiō.
This is a comfort to euery godly
man, when he thinketh vpon it. For this
day is called the reſtoring of all things againe
to their former perfection, Act. 3. It
would greatly reioyce the lame mā or creeple,
to heare that all his limmes ſhould bee
reſtored againe perfectly as they were at ye
firſt. Likewiſe, it would make glad ye heart
of the naked, to heare that he ſhould be clothed
with moſt pretious garments of ſilke
and gold. And why then ſhould not we reioyce
ten thouſand times more, to heare
that we ſhall be reſtored to all integritie of
body and ſoule, and clothed with moſt perfite
and pure innocency of life for euer and
euer? For our comfort, this day is likened
to the pleaſant time of harueſt, wherein the
godly ſhall be gathered into the barne of
Chriſt as pure wheat, and the wicked caſt

out into the fire, as the vnprofitable chaffe
good for nothing, Matth. 13. So that they
which ſowe here in teares, ſhall there reape
in ioy. This day is alſo termed by Chriſt &amp;
Paul, the day of the redemption of our bodies
from all miſeries: for they ſhall bee
no more ſicke, weake, deformed, lame, naked,
hungry, thirſty, and that which is the
greateſt of all, they ſhall ceaſe from ſinning
any more, for they ſhal be like the glorious
body of Ieſus Chriſt, without ſpot or blemiſh.
And is not this a ſingular comfort?
The fineſt body here, is but a carion in reſpect
of the fouleſt there. In this day, the
righteous ſhall haue dominion ouer the
wicked, Pſalm. 49. Dauid when he conſidered
of this day ſo ioyfull, ſayde, that his
heart did reioyce, becauſe his body ſhould
not for euer be left in the graue, Pſalm. 16.
This day is called of Paul to Titus 2. The
bleſſed hope, of the effect which it hath to
make vs there all bleſſed without ende in
ioy vnſpeakeable. This reſurrection,
which leadeth vnto euerlaſting life, may
well be likened to the laſt doore, that in the
court or palace of kings, leadeth into the
princes priuy chamber, or the chamber of
preſence: (for a mā can haue no acceſſe thither,

vntill he haue paſſed through many other
doores and houſes:) ſo ſurely it is in
the life to come. We can not come or enter
into the kingdome of heauē, euen the priuy
chamber of Ieſus Chriſt, and there behold
his preſence, except we firſt paſſe by many
doores in this life, which doe leade vs thither:
as for example, we muſt firſt paſſe by
our election, then by our creation, thirdly,
by our redemption, wrought by Chriſt vpon
the croſſe, fourthly, by iuſtification, fiftly,
by ſanctification of life, and laſt of all,
we muſt come to the reſurrection, as the
laſt doore, if we will haue our finall glorification,
which is euerlaſting life, to beholde
and inioy the ſweete and louing countenance
of the Lorde. Yea Paul goeth further,
and ſayth, that by many tribulations,
as ſtrayte doores and gates, which wring
vs, wee muſt enter into the kingdome of
God. Needes therefore muſt the reſurrection
be ioyfull, whē as it leadeth vs directly
to ſuch a palace of pleaſure, as ſhall neuer
ende, &amp; therefore is called of Peter, the time
of refreſhing, both of bodye and ſoule,
in the preſence of the Lorde, Actes 3. The
holy Apoſtle willed ye 
                     Theſſalonians to cō
                     fort
them ſelues with ye ioyfull remēbrance

of this day. 1. Theſſ. 4. For it ſhalbe vnto
vs as a new birth, or natiuitie in al purenes,
And if wee ſo celebrate the dayes of our
birth, wherein we were borne into a vale of
myſerye and troubles, howe ought wee to
celebrate and keepe holy this day, wherein
we ſhall be exempted from all curſes of
this preſent life! This day is termed our
marriage day: if we reioyce here when we
are married to a mortall creature, peraduenture
to our greater payne, and trouble
thē before, oh dearely beloued, how ſhould
we be affected, &amp; what tokens of ioy ought
we to ſhewe foorth, when wee ſhalbe marryed
to the ſonne of God Chriſt Ieſus for
euer in fayth and trueth, with a band which
neuer ſhalbe broken! as the Lord ſpeaketh
in Oſe 2. chapter, and Reuelat. 19. In this
day ſhall the gates of heauen be ſet wide
open vnto vs, which were ſhut vp before, &amp;
our bodies ſhall ſo much excell the bodyes
which we now beare about with vs, as the
ſunne doeth paſſe and ouercome the moone
in brightneſſe and light. O what a ioye is
this to haue our eſtate like vnto the bleſſed
Angels of God, moſt pure and diuine creatures!
If this cannot moue vs, I ſee nothing
yt may doe it. I am ſure this reward

ſo moued good Moſes, that hee forſooke
the kingdome in Egypt, and ſuffered paine
with the people of God, to come to this life
in the ende, Hebr. 11. Yea, this hope of life
to come, made Abraham to leaue his coū
                     trey,
and to goe to the land of Canaan as a
poore ſtranger, Gen. 12. This made Paul
to go through thicke and thinne in this life,
that he might attayne to the reſurrection,
when he had ſeene the ioyes and pleaſures,
that were ſhewed vnto him in Paradiſe,
when hee was taken vp thither, 2. Cor. 12.
Of this ioy, our Sauiour gaue his diſciples
a taſt in the Mount, when hee was tranſfigured
before them: but it was nothing in
reſpect of this. Nowe as theſe thinges are
moſt comfortable to ye godly, to heare yt their
bodyes ſhall be rayſed vp to ſuch glory:
So is this day moſt fearefull to the vngodly,
which haue here liued a diſſolute life: For
they ſhall ſay at that day to the hilles, Fall
vpon vs, and to ye mountaynes, Couer vs.
but this ſhall not preuayle, for they ſhalbe
raiſed vp, but to their ſhame and confuſion
for euer, as Daniel ſaith, Cha. 12. They ſhal
come forth (as our ſauiour ſayth,) but to
the reſurrection of condemnation, and ſo
to be puniſhed from the preſence of ye Lord

Ieſus, with the worme of cōſcience, which
ſhal neuer leaue to bite thē, &amp; with ye fire
which ſhal not be quenched: So they ſhal
periſh worthily through their owne corruption,
and receiue the wages of vnrighteouſneſſe,
as they which count it pleaſure, dayly
to liue dilitiouſly. Theſe men would willingly
wiſhe that this day might neuer be:
but it ſhal come vpon them, and that ſuddenly,
and they ſhalbe taken and ſnared, &amp;
not eſcape this iudgement. For they muſt
yeeld an accoūt of al their vngodly works,
wherby they haue both diſpleaſed the Lord,
and euil intreated his ſayntes here vpon
earth. Thus you haue heard (dearely beloued
brethren) the treatiſe of the reſurrection
by the ſcriptures diſcourſed. Firſt how
that there is a generall riſing of all fleſhe.
Secondly, the endes wherefore it is ordayned:
and then the cōfortable doctrine, that
the godly by this may lay hold on, in all
miſeries of this life. Nowe it remayneth
for a finall concluſion, that while we liue
here, we indeuour to haue our part in the
firſt reſurrection with Chriſt, that we may
by this come to the ſecond, and be bleſſed
with him. Let vs therefore giue thankes to
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who is the reſurrection

and the life, in that he hath vouchſafed
to giue vnto vs an aſſurance of it, in his
owne perſon, in that he roſe againe from ye
dead. And let vs likewiſe pray vnto him, yt
we may ſo liue, as we may be children of
this happy reſurrection to life, hauing an
effectual fayth, with charitie which worketh
by loue in vs, that al our actions whatſoeuer,
may be ſeaſoned &amp; powdered with
it, preparing our ſelues againſt this day,
with mortifying of our fleſh: &amp; ſeeing wee
ſhal meete ſo victorious &amp; glorious a Lord,
comming in the cloudes, let vs purge our
ſelues from all filthineſſe of the fleſhe and
ſpirit, for no vncleane thing ſhall enter in
with him. God for his ſonnes ſake, giue vs
the grace to doe theſe things: to the which
bleſſed and immortall God with the ſonne,
and the holy Ghoſt, be rendred all prayſe,
glory and thankeſgiuing, for euermore.
Amen.
               
               
                  
                  The twelfth Lecture vpon
the twelfth article of our Chriſtian
fayth, which is,
The life euerlaſting.
                  
                     THis is the laſt article of our
Chriſtiā faith, &amp; ye laſt &amp; greateſt
benefite yt God doth beſtow
vpō his church, which is
y• third benefit of thē that followe ye church:
for after remiſſion of ſinnes, and the reſurrection
of our bodyes, followeth this free
gifte of life, which is the ende of all our
fayth, as S. Peter calleth it, 1. Pet 1. The reſurrection
going before, giueth a paſſage
vnto this endleſſe life: for except that reſurrection
come, we cannot fully haue this
benefit. As remiſſion of ſinnes by Chriſt is
the greateſt gifte, that God doeth beſtowe
vpon his children in this life: ſo in ye world
to come, this euerlaſting life doeth ſo far
ſurmount all the reſt, as ye earth in cōpaſſe
doth paſſe ye bigneſſe of a tennys bal. This
article ſhal then haue his effect whē Chriſt
ſhal come to iudgment, &amp; not before. For
of al the articles of our faith, theſe three only
remain to be accōpliſhed, ye general iudgmēt,
ye reſurrectiō, and this life euerlaſting,

which ſhal al be fulfilled together. The meanīg
of this article is this: I yt am a true chriſtiā,
do ſtedfaſtly beleeue, yt as I haue already
a ſure pledge of this life in me, which is ye
holy ghoſt working in my heart full hope
of it, by ye ſeede of Gods word: ſo I ſhal in ye
world to come haue this bleſſed life moſt
abundantly powred vpō me, in ful meaſure
of al happines both in body &amp; alſo in ſoule,
which ſhal neuer haue any terme of yeeres,
but ſhal cōtinue for euer, as ye Lord himſelf
doth, without ending, in which ſtate I ſhal
prayſe the Lord my God, not in part as I
did here, and wt the dregges of ſinne, but wt
                     out
all ſinne, neuer ceaſing to praiſe him, &amp;


yet without al wearines, Re. 21. As cōcerning
ye excellency of this eternal life, if all
ye tongues of men &amp; of angels, were ioyned
&amp; vnited together all in one, with all their
knowledge &amp; eloquēce to expreſſe it, if they
ſhould be about it a thouſād thouſād yeres:
yet notwithſtanding, they al ſhal not be able
to expreſſe &amp; vtter ye leaſt part of it, no
not ye ioy and pleaſure of one quarter of an
houre: ſo great, ſo inſpeakable, ſo incomprehenſible
are ye thinges yt the Lord Ieſus
hath layd vp for al them that loue &amp; ſerue
him. For although wee heare this life to be

repleniſhed wt ioy, happines &amp; pleaſure, yet
theſe thinges are farre remoued frō ye capacitie
of our ſenſes, vntill the day come,
wherein we ſhall ſee him, as he is, &amp; he reueile
his glory vnto vs, euen face to face, y•
we may ſee him perfectly. Wherefore the
prophets and Apoſtles, ſeeing this bleſſed
kingdome wherin wee ſhall be placed, to be
in it ſelfe ineſtimable, &amp; not to be declared,
as it is in deede, to giue them a taſte of it,
whome they would ſturre vp to be in loue
with it, they all haue deſcribed it by earthly
pleaſures &amp; cōmodities, which heere we
make great account of. So our Sauiour
vſed to expreſſe it by an earthly table of
kinges &amp; princes, furniſhed wt all maner of
deynties &amp; delicates, to pleaſe both ye eye &amp;
ye taſte of mā, ſaying to his diſciples, Ye are
they which haue cōtinued with me in my
tentations: therefore I appoint vnto you a
kingdōe, as my father hath appointed vnto
me, that ye may eate and drinke at my
table in my kingdome, &amp; ſit on ſeates, and
iudge the twelue tribes of Iſrael, Luke. 22
Here Chriſt expreſſed ſpirituall thinges by
corporal and earthly bleſſings. But this we
muſt thinke: If the Lord God do conteine
in himſelfe ye fulneſſe of all felicitie &amp; good
things, then we, hauing ye fruitiō of ye Lord,

ſhal deſire nothing beſides him. And this is
yt moſt great &amp; precious promiſe, yt Peter
ſpeaketh of, which is giuē to vs, That wee
ſhould be partakers of the diuine nature,
2. Pet. 1. For ye Lord ſhalbe gloryfied in all
his Saintes, &amp; ſhalbe made marueilous in
thē yt beleeu. If thē ye Lord God ſhall cō
                     municate
&amp; impart wt his elect, his glory,
his iuſtice, his vertue, his goodnes, yea after
a ſort ſhal giue himſelfe vnto thē, wee may
be ſure yt we ſhal haue ioyes infinite, &amp; without
ende, ſuch in deede, as y• eye hath not
ſene, nor ye eare heard, nor ye tōgue cā ſpeak,
nor ye heart &amp; mind of man cā poſſibly conceaue
&amp; imagine, which paſſe al vnderſtanding:
ſo yt they ought to make vs wōderfully
amaſed &amp; aſtonied, whē we cōſider of thē,
they do ſo far exceede our capacitie, &amp; reach
of wit. The excellencie of this life may be
ſeene in theſe 2. things: firſt in ye happines
of our ſoule: then in ye welfare of our body.
As touching ye ſoule, it ſhalbe moſt happy,
for it ſhal ceaſe to ſin, &amp; ſhalbe wholy ioyned
to ye Lord in faith &amp; truth, &amp; neuer diſpleaſe
him any more. What a great ioy is this! Againe,
ye things yt thē ſhal beautify our ſoule,
ſhalbe moſt perfit: our knowledge, our wiſedome,
our vnderſtanding, which here is all
darkned, ſhal there be inlightned wt ye glory

and light of the Lorde: all vertues and ornaments
of the minde ſhal abound in vs euen
to the full, and euery thing that is vnperfite,
ſhalbe then done away, no griefe of
the minde, no ſorow of heart, no torment
of conſcience any more, but peace, ioy and
tranquillity euer to endure. This is the Image
wherein wee were firſt created, and
ſhall then be renewed to a more perfite eſtate
of life, then it was in before the fall of
Adam. Our ſoule there ſhall not be enemy
to the body, neither ſhall the ſpirit
rebel agaynſt the fleſhe, but it ſhall loue the
Lord with all his might. And if the ioy of
the minde and ſoule be ſo great here many
times in the childrē of God, that they ſeeme
to be in heauē, what ſhal it be there (thinke
yee) when it ſhalbe in full poſſeſſion of all
his delights and ſpirituall pleaſures, euer
ſinging and making ſweete melody to the
Lorde, and yet without any wearyneſſe at
al? For olde things are al paſſed away, and
behold, all things ſhal become new againe,
and the thinges that are there, ſhalbe eternall.
For Chriſt ſhall giue vnto all his eternall
life, Iohn 17. This is the happines
of the ſoule. Now let vs ſee the bleſſed
eſtate alſo of the body, and that ſhall the

better appeare, if we compare it with the
ſtate that it is in here. Our bodies are nowe
deformed, there they ſhall be moſt faire and
beautifull, yea that which is more, they ſhal
be like the glorious and immortall bodie of
Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe. Here the body is many
times maymed and vnperfit, there it ſhal
be perfite and in his integritie: here it is in
ſickeneſſe, in pouertie, in nakedneſſe, in
woundes, in ſtripes, in botches, in ſores, and
in all incurable diſeaſes: there ſhall it bee
whole and all ſounde, rich and glorious, clothed
with innocency, and neuer able to feele
any infirmitie any more. For heere it is
ſowen in diſhonour, in weakeneſſe, in corruption:
and there it riſeth in honour, in
power, in incorruption and immortalitie.
Here be many things that make it to offend
agaynſt God: there is nothing that ſhall
cauſe it to ſinne: it ſhall not, as it did here,
luſt againſt the ſpirit, but be at peace and vnitie
with it: the ſight of it moſt quicke in
ſeeing, and very perfite it ſhall be in all the
ſenſes, in hearing, in ſmelling, in taſting, in
handling. It ſhall haue all melody and muſike
to delite the eare, euen angels ſinging
continually: it ſhall haue all ſightes and
ſhewes to delite and pleaſe the eye, euen the

perpetuall preſence of the bleſſed Trinitie.
All odoriferous ſmels, as it were of muſks,
perfumes, flowers, the ſweete incenſe of
praiſe and thankeſgiuing, to ſmell delectably
in the noſtrels of the Lorde, and ours,
ſhall not there be wanting. O what a ioye
is this to the bodie, to haue all thinges at
commaundement, that may well pleaſe and
delight it! The pleaſures of Kinges and
Queenes are nothing to thoſe things wherof
we ſpeake, yea the pleaſures ſhalbe ſo exceeding
great, that if all ye ioyes &amp; paſtimes
of this life were compared vnto them, they
ſhould be founde to be but pangues and torments.
Yea the cōtinuance of all our delites
here for an hundred yeres, is not like to the
bleſſednes of one minute of an houre there,
nor worthy to be likened vnto it. For verely
to ſpeake with Dauid, I had rather be
there but for one daye, then here a thouſand
yeeres, in all the triumphes that Emperours
and Kings can make with all their
power. This is then the happines of the bodie:
Now howe great ſhall the bleſſedneſſe
be, when both the body and ſoule ſhalbe conioyned
together, and raigne for euermore▪
Surely as great as ye glory of the Lorde is,
&amp; his excellent Maieſtie, which is infinite:

ſo great ſhall this glory of the Saintes be.
The loue of this life, which is euerlaſting,
ſhould make (me thinks) kings &amp; princes to
do their dueties to the Lord, to raigne ouer,
&amp; gouerne their ſubiects in iuſtice &amp; equity,
and not to liue in pleaſures. The reſpect of
theſe ioyes ſhoulde make Counſellers to
ſpeake the trueth boldely, &amp; ſyncerely without
flattering and diſſimulation to princes,
conſidering what a rewarde is layde vp for
them in heauen. This ſhoulde make all Biſhops
and miniſters of the worde, to do their
duetie in reprehending ſinne ſtoutly, and in
contemning this vayne worlde, in teaching
the flock without lucre &amp; gayne, ſeeing that
when the great ſhepherd Ieſus Chriſt ſhal
appeare, they ſhal receiue an incorruptible
crowne of glory, 1. Pet. 5. Finally, the cōſideration
of this life, which is for euer, might
make euery eſtate and degree in their callings,
either hie or lowe, to doe moſt cheerefully
their ſeuerall dueties to all men, that
in the ende their parte may bee in the heauenly
inheritaunce, which fadeth not away.
O that our mindes were erected vp
to theſe thinges, they woulde not ſo lightly
bee carryed away to ſinne and wickedneſſe,
fearing leaſt we ſhoulde leeſe theſe

euerlaſting ioyes. This is the rewarde that
Chriſt hath promiſed to them, that followe
him here, in the regeneration, that haue
for his names ſake forſaken houſes, brethren,
ſiſters, father, mother, wyfe, children
and landes, they ſhall inherite all things,
euen euerlaſting life, Matth. 19. This life
ſhalbe moſt happie and ioyfull, eyther in reſpect
of the perſons, with whome we ſhall
be, or elſe in reſpect of the place, which is
heauen, the ſeate of God, or in the conſideration
of the time, which is for euer. Although
wee be here many times in a good
place, yet if our company be not good &amp; honeſt,
this can be no delite to a godly man.
Nowe in heauen we ſhall haue the glorious
fruition of the Father, the Sonne, &amp; the holy
Ghoſt, the ſocietie of all the angels, moſt
excellent creatures, the company of the Patriarkes,
the Prophets, the Apoſtles, the noble
hoſte of Martyrs, briefly the fellowſhip
of all the elect &amp; Saintes of God, that euer
haue bin. This can not be but an vnſpeakable
delite to vs all, when we conſider of it.
Secōdly, we ſhalbe bleſſed in reſpect of the
place, for otherwiſe, if the cōpany be good, &amp;
yet the place not correſpondent vnto it in al
things, as not being large ynough, or ſweet,

or glorious, there cā be no great delite there:
but this place is moſt anſwereable to the cō
                     pany,
wide &amp; large, faire, ſweete &amp; glorious,
euen the heauen of heauens, the ſeate of the
Almighty, a place of ioy, a place of cōfort, a
place of all ſpirituall delectation. S. Iohn
ſeeing it in the ſpirit, hath deſcribed it as far
forth as fleſh &amp; blood can conceaue of it, vnder
earthly things. I ſawe (ſaith he) a newe
heauen &amp; a new earth, &amp; I ſaw the holy citie
new Ieruſalem, come down from God
out of heauē, prepared as a bride trimmed
for her husband. Iohn compareth the place
wherein we ſhalbe, to a citie moſt glorious
&amp; excellēt, whoſe ſhining was like to a ſtone
moſt precious, as a Iaſper ſtone, cleare as
Chryſtal, whoſe wal was great &amp; hie, which
had twelue gates, &amp; at the gates twelue angels.
The wal of the citie had twelue foūdations,
which were garniſhed with all maner
of precious ſtones, as Iaſpers, Saphires,
Emeraudes, &amp; ſuch like, the building of the
wall is of Iaſper, &amp; the citie was al of pure
golde, like vnto cleare glaſſe. The twelue
gates were twelue pearles, and the ſtreete
of the citie is pure golde, as ſhining glaſſe.
This Citie hath no neede of the ſunne, neither
of the moone to ſhine in it, for the glory

of God did light it, &amp; the Lambe is the light
of it. The gates of it ſhall not bee ſhutte
by day, for there ſhalbe no night there, there
ſhall be no death, no ſorowe, no crying, no
payne, for the firſt things are paſſed. There
ſhalbe a pure riuer of water of life, cleare
as Chriſtall, and the tree of life bearing
twelue maner of fruites. And there ſhall
be no more curſe, but Gods ſeruantes ſhall
raygne there for euermore. This is the
place, which Iohn hath ſhadowed out vnto
vs, as well as he could vnder theſe terreſtriall
benefites of golde, and ſiluer, and
precious ſtones, whereas in deede it can
not be deſcribed as it is in it ſelfe, becauſe
no man hath ſeene it, and we beyng groſſe
and carnall, muſt haue it by carnall and viſible
thinges ſet foorth vnto vs. Thirdly,
the excellencie of this life is ſeene in the
continuance of it, in that, that it neuer decayeth
or waxeth olde. If here belowe we
had all pleaſures &amp; delites both for the ſoule
and body, yea although the place we were
in, were moſt excellent &amp; glorious, and the
company in al reſpects according to our deſire,
good, pleaſant and honeſt: yet if theſe
thinges were but for a dayes, or an houres
continuance, what great contentation of

minde, or recreation for the body might be
here, ſeeing wee muſt depart very ſhortly
from theſe pleaſures? and then it had him as
good, if they had not bene at al. For all theſe
thinges are like vnto pleaſant muſike, in a
ſette of viols, which when they ceaſe once,
(and ceaſe needes muſt euery thing in this
life, be it neuer ſo pleaſant) then it is al one,
as if wee had neuer heard this muſike, ſo
ſweete and delectable to our eares, there is
no print or token of it left behinde, but al vaniſheth
away with ye very ſtaying of it: Euē
as after the flying of a birde in the ayre, or
the paſſing of a ſhip in the ſea, there is no
trace found after them, Wiſ. 5. But dearely
beloued, beleue me, this life ſhal haue yeres
without ende in vnſpeakeable ioy, in this ſo
excellent a place, we ſhal heare muſike continually,
and yet it ſhal neuer ceaſe, nor we
be wearie to heare it. And when we haue
bene there in theſe delightes ſo long, and ſo
many thouſande yeeres, as there be eyther
ſandes in the ſea, or graſſes vpon the whole
face of the earth, or ſtarres in the ſkye,
which all are inmunerable to vs: yet then
we ſhal not come out, or leaue theſe ioyes,
but ſtill it is with vs, as if it were to begin.
O the vnſpeakable mercy of ye Lord Ieſus,

that he hath reſerued for thoſe that feare and
loue him here! What man therefore is ſo
fooliſh, ſo madde, ſo beaſtlike in his conuerſation,
that will not at all be mooued with
theſe pleaſures and ioyes! For theſe things,
as the Angel ſayd to Iohn, are faithfull and
true, and therefore to be beleeued, and they
that beleeue them not, their parte is in the
lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone,
which is prepared for the vnbeleeuers, Reuela.
21. For from this roote of vnbeleefe,
proceede all the branches of all other ſinnes
&amp; wickednes whatſoeuer, as lying, ſtealing,
couetouſnes, adulterie, and ſuch like. This
life and the dignitie of it, the Prophet Dauid
in two wordes hath very well expreſſed
in his 16. Pſalme, the latter ende, Thou
wilt (ſayeth he) ſhewe me the path of life:
in thy preſence is the fulneſſe of ioye, and
at thy right hande there are pleaſures for
euermore. Here, in fulneſſe of ioye and
pleaſures for euermore, is all happineſſe
contayned. For theſe ioyes are the greateſt
that may be, and their endurance is for euer.
Conſidering theſe things, ought we not to
ſay with Paul? I count that the afflictions
of this preſent time, are not worthy of the
glory that ſhalbe ſhewed vnto vs, Rom. 8.

Why, alas then (dearely beloued) what a
great matter were it, if we ſhoulde endure
here afflictiōs al the dayes of our life, which
can not be aboue an hundred yeeres at the
moſt, ſo we might come in the ende to this
eternall ioye and glory? Paul conſidered
this well, and did ſo doe. We faynt not,
(ſayth he) but though our outwarde man
periſh, yet the inwarde man is renewed
dayly. Marke well the wordes that followe,
and laye them vp in your mindes,
and you ſhall, by the grace of God, profite
thereby. For our light affliction, which is
but for a moment, cauſeth vnto vs a farre
moſt excellent, and an eternall weyght of
glory, whyle we looke not on the thinges
which are ſeene, but on the thinges which
are not ſeene. For the thinges which are
ſeene, are temporall, but the things which
are not ſeene, are eternall, 2. Corinth. 4.
Shall we then for an houres pleaſure here
below, leeſe the euerlaſting weyght of glorie
aboue? God forbid we ſhoulde be ſo fooliſh,
and ſo beſotted with this preſent lyfe.
Let this ſaying rather of our Sauiour
Chriſt ſounde continually in your eares:
What ſhall it profite a man if he winne the
whole worlde, and leeſe his owne ſoule?
                     
And yet wee ſee, howe many men do hazarde
and venture their ſoule, not for the whole
worlde, but for a piece of lande, a litle golde
or ſiluer, or a litle credite or vayne eſtimation
in this worlde. If the whole earth then
will not bee able to make a recompence or
an exchange to redeeme our ſoules, beyng
once loſt from the fauour of God, howe
much leſſe then ſhall theſe beggerly things,
wherefore we ſtriue ſo earneſtly, be able to
doe it? Nowe although this life be yet as
it were hid from vs, yet it is moſt certaine:
both becauſe we haue a gage of it, which is
the Spirite it ſelfe of Chriſt, and alſo, inaſmuch
as it is hid in Chriſt, which will
keepe it well, and is able to giue it to vs
in due time. In the meane ſeaſon, vntill it
be reuealed from heauen, we neede faith to
beleeue it aſſuredly, and hope to wayte for
it with patience, which hope neuer maketh
a man aſhamed, but alwayes comforteth
him euen in the middeſt of troubles of this
life, be they neuer ſo great. For we do well
knowe, that when hee doeth appeare, wee
ſhall be like vnto him, and no man neede to
doubt, but that there is ſuch a life, although
it doeth not yet ſeeme ſo to vs: for there is
a Sunne, when it is compaſſed in with

cloudes, and fire is within the aſhes, when
it appeareth not to our ſight: ſo there is a
life for the godly, although deferred, which
Chriſt hath promiſed and ſpoken of, Matth.
25. that it ſhalbe giuen to his ſeruāts. This
life euerlaſting, being ſo deare a thing and
precious, the deuill goeth about by all
meanes, to defeate vs of it, and to plucke it
out of our hand. Therfore we muſt lay hold
on it, as Paul willed Timothie, and fight
the good fight of faith againſt him. This
is our crowne which we muſt holde faſt, yt
no man bereaue vs of it. For if we miſſe of
life in the end we miſſe of all, and if we haue
this, wee haue and poſſeſſe all thinges, for
all bleſſedneſſe whatſoeuer is comprehended
vnder the name of euerlaſting lyfe.
But the beſt comfort for vs is this, that this
life is in the cuſtodie of Ieſus Chriſt, and
wee beyng his ſheepe, no man is able to
plucke vs out of his handes: onely this remayneth
for vs to looke vnto, that we abide
and continue in his fold. Eternal life being
the euerlaſting inheritance of the kingdom
of heauē, the greateſt treaſure that the Lord
hath to beſtow vpon his ſeruantes, no man
muſt thinke, that it commeth to him for

his good works ſake, or that he doth deſerue
it at Gods hand: this were to preiudice and
ouerthrowe the bountifull goodneſſe of the
Lord. This benefite is the free gift of God,
for although wee deſerue hell and death by
our ſinne and wickednes, yet we merit not
heauen by our good deedes, but as Paul
ſayeth, Euerlaſting life is the free gift of
God, Rom. 6. And Chriſt telleth vs, that
this kingdome was prepared for vs long
agoe, euen before the worlde was made,
or we borne, ſo that we coulde not ſtep one
foote vnto it of our ſelues, when we were
not, Matth. 25. It is falſe then that the aduerſaries
of Chriſt, the Papiſtes, haue
taught, that wee may deſerue this life by
our good deedes and workes, when as our
good deedes are not pure in the ſight of the
Lorde. In deede, if our good workes were
eyther perfect, or as many as God commaundeth,
or if they were our owne, and
not Gods giftes in vs, or if laſt of all wee
were not bounde of duetie and by right to
doe them, then might wee with our owne
good works deſerue heauen: but our deedes
are vnperfite, they are not our owne, of
duetie muſt we doe them, therefore they deſerue
nothing, as of duetie from the Lorde.

I graunt that euerlaſting life is called by
our Sauiour a rewarde, but a rewarde is
not of deſert or merit, but of curteſie. A Noble
man may rewarde his tenant for a thing
not woorth a ſhilling, by ſuch a gifte as is
worth twentie ſhillinges: ſhall he therefore
ſaye, that is the poore man, that, becauſe he
hath this rewarde, he hath deſerued it? If he
ſo do, he doth very vnthankfully. When the
ſeruant hath done his duetie, can he clayme
any thing of his maſter by merite? I trowe
no, ſayeth our Sauiour Chriſt, Luke 17.
Neyther doeth the maſter thanke him: So
we, if we had done all things commaunded
vnto vs, (as we are farre from performing
the leaſt of them) yet we are vnprofitable
ſeruants: and what doth an vnprofitable ſeruant
deſerue at the Lordes handes? Surely
not the kingdome of heauen: if he deſerue any
thing, it is ſtripes. Let vs not therefore
thinke, that we can deſerue ought at Gods
handes, or gratifie and pleaſure him, ſo that
he ſhoulde be beholding to vs, &amp; of duetie to
do any thing for vs. This is a very deuiliſh
opinion. Chriſt hath deſerued at Gods hāds
all thinges neceſſarie for vs: therefore if
we be in Chriſt, we ſhall haue all thinges
wee can deſire. The lande of Canaan,

which was but a type &amp; figure of heauē, the
Iewes coulde not get by their owne righteouſnes,
but only by ye free promes of God,
in mercy made vnto them. It ſeemeth they
had ſome opinion of their own deſeruings,
as ye Papiſtes haue now, &amp; therefore Moſes
gaue thē oftētimes in charge, to attribute al
to the fauour of ye Lord, &amp; not to their good
works, as appeareth in ye 7. 8. &amp; 9. of Deut.
but eſpecially in ye 9. chap. wheras he ſaith,
Heare, O Iſrael, thou ſhalt paſſe ouer Iorden
this day, to go in and poſſeſſe nations
greater &amp; mightier then thy ſelfe, &amp; cities
great and walled vp to heauen. A people
great &amp; tall, euen the children of the Anakims,
whō thou knoweſt, &amp; of whom thou
haſt heard ſay, Who can ſtande before the
children of Anak? vnderſtād therfore, that
this day the Lord thy God is he, which goeth
ouer before thee, as a cōſuming fire, he
ſhall deſtroy them, &amp; he ſhall bring them
downe before thy face: ſo thou ſhalt caſt
them out, &amp; deſtroy them ſuddenly, as the
Lord hath ſaid vnto thee. Speake not thou
in thy heart, after that the Lorde thy God
hath caſt them out before thee, ſaying, For
my righteouſnes the Lorde hath brought
me in to poſſeſſe this land: but for the wickednes

of theſe nations the Lord hath caſt
thē out before thee. For thou entreſt not in
to inherit their land, for thy righteouſnes,
or for thy vpright heart, but for the wickednes
of theſe nations the Lord thy God
doeth caſt them out before thee, &amp; that he
might performe the word which the Lord
thy God ſware vnto thy fathers Abraham,
Iſaac, &amp; Iacob. Vnderſtād therfore that ye
Lorde thy God giueth thee not this good
land to poſſeſſe it, for thy righteouſnes, for
thou art a ſtifnecked people. Thus you ſee
how in many words ye Lord throweth down
all their worthineſſe, and extolleth his onely
goodnes towards thē. Now if they were not
able to get &amp; purchaſe this tēporal land of ye
earth: how ſhal we gel heauē? &amp; if a man cā
not builde an houſe and finiſh it, except the
Lord builde it, Pſal. 127. How can any man
buylde an houſe for himſelfe in heauen?
The Iſraelites were taught to ſaye, that
their abundāce in meate &amp; drinke, &amp; other
bleſſings of this life, came frō the Lorde, &amp;
not frō their owne power or ſtrēgth, Deut.
8. verſ. 17. And ſhall we be ſo iniurious to
God, ſo vnthākful to Chriſt, ſo preſūptuous
againſt ye holy ghoſt, as to ſay, we haue gottē
to our ſelues euerlaſting life? God forbid

that this fooliſhneſſe ſhoulde enter into the
heart of any man. Seeing then al theſe ſmal
things come not for our owne deſerts vnto
vs, but for his Chriſtes ſake, much more
muſt we aſcribe to his goodneſſe this great
benefite of life euerlaſting. As concerning
this life to come, to aſke, as many do fondly
and curiouſly, rather then godlily, whether
wee ſhall knowe one another, or whether
we ſhal all be alike in degree: I thinke theſe
queſtions to be ſuch as S. Paul willeth vs
to eſchew &amp; put away farre frō vs. This is
certaine, our knowledge there ſhall be moſt
perfite and abſolute: for then ſhall I knowe
as I am knowen, and no ignorance of any
thing that is neceſſarie, ſhall be in vs, and euery
man ſhall bee contented, and haue his
full ioye in all meaſure of his quantitie,
ſo that the leaſt pynte potte ſhall be as full
for his meaſure, as the greateſt tunne is
with his quantitie. All men there ſhall
haue fulneſſe of ioye, Pſalme 16. The
Lord ſende vs thyther, and we will be content
with the loweſt roune, as Dauid profeſſed
of himſelfe. The beſt queſtion for al to
aſke, eſpecially of the ſimple and vnlearned,
is, to know throughly the way that bringeth
vs thither, which is onely Ieſus Chriſt,

                     the way, the trueth, and the life, Iohn 14.
And ſo dyd our Sauiour anſwere: for being
curiouſly demaunded of one, howe
many ſhoulde be ſaued: he tolde him the
meanes howe he ſhoulde be ſaued. And ſo
muſt wee doe alſo, and not feede the fancies
of men, or delite their vaine humors.
I am ſure there bee many men that will
aſke what we ſhall doe in heauen, and what
we ſhall eate and drinke, or whether we ſhal
be clothed there: which can not tell howe
to come thither, if they were demaunded
the queſtion. And what a madneſſe is this,
to ſtriue for the ſhadowe, and to let the body
goe? to enquire to knowe things which we
are not commaunded to ſearch after, and to
let goe thoſe things which we are bound to
knowe? And this vice is moſt common to
them whom we terme fine witted felowes,
which contemne common and neceſſarie
queſtions, to ſeeke out deepe and profound
queſtions, nothing at all tending to godlineſſe,
but rather to the ſubuerſion and ouerthrowe
of all religion and honeſtie. Theſe
men the holy Ghoſt doeth wil vs to auoide,
and ſeeing they are fooles, to anſwere them
with ſilence to their fooliſh queſtiōs. Theſe
things breede ſtrife and controuerſie about

words, and they are like to that ſerpent
Hidra, which of one idle head, bring foorth a
great manie to deſtruction. Here is no mention
made of hel or of death, becauſe all that
is in this confeſſion of fayth, is ſet downe
for the onely comfort of the godly, and not
for their terrour. Notwithſtanding as there
is a life, and a great rewarde for the godly
after this race is ended: So is there a hell,
and ſeconde, death prepared of olde for the
wicked and reprobate. For our Sauiour
Chriſt ſpeaking of this life, ſpeaketh
alſo ioyntly of the euerlaſting deſtruction
in fire, which is for the deuill and all his angels,
and thoſe that in this life haue ſerued
him here with their bodies and ſoules, and
all their members. Theſe (ſayeth Chriſt)
ſhall goe into euerlaſting payne, Matt. 25.
Where Origen and all thoſe that thought
this payne ſhould not be for euer, are moſt
playnely confuted: for Chriſt affirmeth it
to haue no ende. To this ſaying of Chriſt
agreeth that in Eſay the 30. Chapter, verſe
33. Tophet is prepared of olde, it is euen
prepared for the King, hee hath made it
deepe and large: the burning thereof is
fire and much wood: the breath of the
Lorde like a riuer of brimſtone, doeth

kindle it. Here is a full deſcription of hell:
For by Tophet he meaneth hell. He declareth
moreouer when it was made, euen of
olde, for whom alſo, for the King, he meaneth
the King of Babylon, enemie to the
Church, ſignifying that God reſpecteth no
mans perſon, but that hell is as well prepared
for Kings and Queenes, for Lords
and Ladies, and for great men, as well as
the poore, that doe not beleeue. Yea, the
greateſt part of men goeth this way, in euery
eſtate and degree: ſo that we had neede
to looke about vs, to enter in at the ſtraight
gate, for fewe there be that finde it, but
many that paſſe by the broade way. Matt.
7. For this Tophet is deepe &amp; large to conteyne
and to receyue many, yea moe noble
men ſhall go thither then to heauen. The
Prophete deſcribeth the payne of it, by fire
burning with much wood: the continuance
is for euer, becauſe the breath of the Lorde
which endureth for euer, doeth kindle the
fire, as a riuer of brimſtone. The ioyes then
of heauen are not ſo inſpeakable, but that
the torments and pangs of hell are as intolerable.
Wherefore the wicked, although
they be not moued with the pleaſures at the
right hand of God, to come vnto him by repentance:

yet in my iudgement the exceeding
great tormentes of endleſſe hell fire
ſhoulde moue them to amende. For ſurely
(dearely beloued) if all the paynes that
may be deuiſed in this life, all the ſickneſſes
that euer haue bene, all the torments of tyrants,
all the griefes of minde that may be,
were all of them layde together, and compared
to this hell fire, theſe paynes howe
great ſoeuer they ſeeme to be here, are but
fleabytings, yea rather pleaſures, in reſpect
of this helliſh fire, it is ſo great. And this
fire although it be ſo great, yet ſhall it burne
for euer and euer, not onely the body, but
alſo the ſoule, the minde, the conſcience, and
all the inner parts of the damned ſort. And
when they haue beene there as many hundred
thouſande yeeres, as there are peeble
ſtones in the ſea ſhore, yet ſhal they not then
come out, but continue ſtill, as if they were
to beginne anewe. For Chriſts wordes are
true, this fire is euerlaſting, and can neuer
be quenched, Matthewe 3. &amp; 25. It were
well with Iudas, if he myght come out of
this wofull hell and paynes, when he hath
ſuffered them ſo many hundred thouſande
millions of yeeres, as there are ſtarres in
the firmament: but this can not be granted

vnto him. If men therefore woulde conſider
of theſe two extremities, wherein is no
meane: of the ioyes of paradiſe which are
endleſſe, and of the torments of hell and the
wrath of God, which alſo hath no ende: then
ſurely woulde they liue in feare and godlineſſe
in this preſent worlde. For as heauen
is full of ioy and mirth: ſo hell is full of dolor
and ſorowe: and as in heauen is continuall
reioycing and peace of minde: ſo is there
in hell a perpetuall weeping, with gnaſhing
of teeth for woe and payne. As the glorie of
the Lorde ſhall inlyghten the elect with his
gratious countenance: ſo ſhall the great
maieſtie &amp; wrath of the Lorde, preſſe downe
the vngodly for euer. Finally, as in heauen
the ſaintes ſhall haue all things to do them
good that they can deſire: ſo in hell the
damned ſpirits ſhal haue nothing to refreſh
them, not ſo much as a droppe of colde water,
(which is but a ſmall thing) to coole
their tongue withall. And as I ſayde before
of heauen and heauenly ioyes, ſo may I
ſpeake of this ſeconde death: that if all the
men in the whole worlde woulde go about
to expreſſe theſe tormentes, with all their
eloquence and learning, yet ſhall they bee
neuer able to doe it: they are ſo vnſpeakeable

and not to be vttered of any man. And
theſe are the righteous iudgementes of the
Lord, that he to ye wicked might be knowen
to be a iuſt and a terrible God, to rewarde
impenitent ſinners after their woorkes, as
they haue deſerued. For this ende, ſayeth
the Lorde to Pharao, I haue ſtirred thee
vp, that I myght ſhewe my great power
and myght vpon thee, in puniſhing thee
accordingly. Let the wicked therefore
take heede, for there will come a day that
will pay for all: and then what aduantage
will it be, to haue gotten an houres pleaſure,
with the purchaſe of euerlaſting
woes? But theſe things, and theſe euils, by
the benefite of Ieſus Chriſt are farre from
vs, and ſhall not come neere the dwelling
of the righteous. Wherefore wee ought
with Paul to giue thankes alway to God,
becauſe that from the beginning he hath
choſen vs to ſaluation, through ſanctification
of the ſpirite, and beleefe of the trueth:
neyther hath he appoynted vs to wrath as he
hath the wicked, but to obtaine this euerlaſting
life, whereof we ſpeake, by the meanes
of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which died for vs,
that whether we ſleepe or wake, we ſhoulde
liue together with him. In the meane ſeaſon

it is our part to ſtande faſt, and not to
bee remoued from this faith, but to laye
hande of this eternall life, whereunto wee
through the benefit of the Goſpel preached,
are called freely of GOD, with an holy
calling, not according to our workes, but
of his goodneſſe. Wee muſt alſo fight this
good fight of faith, and ſtriue lawfully: if
we hope to bee crowned, and to continue to
the ende, wee muſt endeuour that wee may
bee ſaued: for they that ſhrinke backe, leeſe
this excellent reward, for the which we are
commaunded to ſell all that we haue, and
to bye it, Matth. 13. We haue nowe heard
the meaning of all the twelue articles of
our Chriſtian fayth, which are neceſſarie
to ſaluation: Firſt, wee haue ſeene the
article that concerneth our truſt in God the
Father, &amp; what things we learne by it: Secondly,
we haue declared the articles which
conteine ye myſteries of Chriſt Ieſus with
our redemption &amp; glorification, and other
benefits apperteining thereunto. Thirdly,
the beleefe in the holy Ghoſt, the third perſon
in Trinitie, hath bene opened vnto vs,
and what comfort may thereof ariſe to the
faithfull: Fourthly and laſtly, the articles

concerning the Church and the benefites
thereto belonging, haue beene expounded
as God hath giuen vs grace. Theſe things
are written, that we might beleeue that Ieſus
Chriſt is the Sonne of God, and Sauiour
of the world, and that in beleeuing we
myght haue life through this name: Seeing
then wee haue hearde theſe thinges,
let vs, as the holy and bleſſed Apoſtle of
Chriſt, Saint Peter, willeth vs, be ready
alwayes to giue an anſwere to euery man
that aſketh vs a reaſon of the fayth and hope
that is in vs, with meekeneſſe and reuerence.
And nowe let vs giue thankes as
wee are continually bounde, to our heauenly
Father, in that it hath pleaſed him to
make vs Chriſtians to beleeue theſe articles
of our fayth, to our great and endleſſe
comfort. And let vs pray vnto him withall
in the name of his welbeloued Sonne,
that he would giue vs grace to growe more
and more euery day in this fayth, that wee
may not onely liue in it, but alſo in the ende
of our dayes, die in it moſt conſtantly,
that ſo wee may bee bleſſed: And that it
woulde pleaſe him to giue this grace, not
only to vs, but to all people &amp; nations of the
earth, eſpecially to his vniuerſall Church,

whereſoeuer it be diſperſed abroade in all
quarters of the earth. And in this Church
let vs pray for the ſtate of all Kinges and
Princes, that wee may liue a godly and
quiet life, with all peace and honeſtie: eſpecially,
let vs commende to his fauour the
Church of Englande, deſiring him to bleſſe
it as hee hath done theſe many yeeres, and
to continue his holy Goſpel amongſt vs, although
wee for our vnthankfulneſſe haue
deſerued to haue it taken away from vs
long agoe. Deſyre wee of him, in mercy
ſtill to beholde his ſeruant and handmaide,
our Queene and ſoueraigne, that ſhee may
bee ſtill zealous to ſet forwarde the Goſpell
of Chriſt, and to roote vp all ſuperſtition
and idolatrie within her realme, that ſhee
may bee wiſe to foreſee and preuent all miſchiefes
and dangers, that are likely to hang
ouer our heades, that ſo ſhee may haue a
long &amp; a bleſſed reigne ouer vs to his glory,
the profite and commoditie of all her louing
ſubiectes. Let vs likewiſe deſire of God,
to bleſſe all her moſt honourable Counſell
with true godlineſſe and wiſedome from
aboue, that they may boldly, and ſtoutly
miniſter to her maieſtie the beſt aduice, for

the better ouerſeeing and gouernment of
this Chriſtian common wealth wherein
they liue, that all their counſelles and policies,
may eſpecially bee directed to the honour
of God. Pray we him, to bleſſe the
ſtate of the miniſterie of this lande, the Byſhops,
and Paſtours of his worde, that not
onely in worde, but alſo in good and godly
conuerſation of life, they may beautifie
the glorious Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt: beſeech
we him to roote out from his miniſterie
al rauening wolues, papiſtes, Atheiſtes,
blinde and vnlearned miniſters, and dumme
dogges, which ſeeke onely to fill their bellies,
and not to edifie the congregation:
that if it be his will, he would giue to euery
Church her faithfull and wiſe diſpenſer
of the myſteries of Chriſt. And becauſe the
ſchooles of good learning, are as Nurſes
and well ſpringes thereunto: let vs deſire
Chriſt, to giue his ſpirite amongſt them alſo
in the vniuerſities, that good learning
and godlines may growe, and increaſe dayly
more and more. Laſtly, for the whole body
of this common weale, let vs pray, that
God would keepe them al in his feare, from
the hieſt to the loweſt, and giue them duetiful

and obedient heartes towarde their
prince and magiſtrates, which are by his authoritie
ſet ouer them, for their welfare and
happineſſe. Theſe thinges and all other
graces, he onely graunt vnto vs, which onely
is able and wiſe, and hath immortalitie,
which dwelleth in the light that no man can
ſee, to whom with his ſonne Chriſt Ieſus,
and the holy Ghoſt his infinite
power, bee rendred all prayſe,
honour and glory, for euer
and euer. Amen.
                  The Lorde be prayſed.
               
               
                  
                  
                  
                     ❧ A declaration of the
holy Communion.
                  
                     THe holy Communion, called
alſo the Lordes Supper,
was ordeined, not of any
mortall man, but of the
Lorde Ieſus himſelfe, that
as often as wee come vnto
it, (for often it is to be receiued) we ſhoulde
remēber ye great loue of our maſter Chriſt,
who loued vs ſo well, that he gaue his body
and blood for to redeeme vs from all our
ſinnes. That this great benefite ſhould neuer
be forgotten of Chriſtians, he inſtituted
that we ſhoulde receiue bread and wine, in
ye remembrance of his death, &amp; therfore this
ſacrament hath two partes: the one is the
outward ſignes, bread and wine, to put vs in
mind, that as bread doth nouriſh the body, ſo
doth Chriſts body nouriſh our ſoules, receiued
ſpiritually by faith into our heartes, Ephe.
3. 17. &amp; as wine doth refreſh vs, &amp; quēch
our thirſt, ſo doeth his blood refreſh our
minds, and waſh them from ſinne, &amp; quench
the ſpiritual thirſt of our ſoules: and this ſacrament
of Chriſtes death is not giuen vs
in bread onely, but in wine alſo, to teach vs

that Ieſus Chriſt is all in all vnto vs, not
only meate to feede vs, Iohn 6. 35. but alſo
drinke to quench our thirſt, as he ſaith, Iohn
7. 37. If any man thirſt, let him come to me
and drinke. And ſo hee is alſo our apparell:
Put you on the Lorde Ieſus, Rom. 13. 14.
The other part of this Supper is ſpirituall:
the remiſſion of ſinnes, and heauenly
graces receiued of vs, as truely as wee receiue
the ſignes of them, if wee beleeue: for
this is to confirme our faith in this matter,
that we ſhoulde doubt no more of Gods fauour,
then we doubt whether we haue receiued
the viſible ſignes. Nowe for the comming
to this Supper, that wee deceiue not
our ſelues, we muſt haue theſe two things:
firſt, repentance of our former ſinfull life,
to bee ſorie for it which is done, by trying
and examining our ſelues, whether wee bee
heartily ſorowfull or no for our offences: ſecondly,
we muſt haue faith in Ieſus Chriſt,
yt yet we deſpaire not for our great ſinnes,
but truſt to haue mercy at his handes when
we cal vpon him, ſo that before we come vnto
this banket, wee muſt prepare our ſelues
to come worthily, reuerently, in faith, hope,
and loue: this is the examination. In receiuing
of it our mindes muſt not bee on the

bread and wine, or vpon any other earthly
thinges, but vpon the body and blood of Ieſus
Chriſt in heauen, ſignified vnto vs by
theſe things belowe. After wee haue receiued,
wee muſt giue vnto Chriſte moſt
humble and heartie thankes, for feeding vs
with his body and blood, and meditate and
thinke vpon this continually, &amp; not returne
to our olde life againe. Thus doing, you
ſhal be ſure to come as the Lorde requireth,
and as a good Chriſtian ought to do. Which
the Lorde graunt vnto you for his mercies
ſake, Amen.
               
            
         
         
            
               
                  
                  
                  
                     A briefe and
cleare confeſſion of the
Chriſtian faith, conteining an
hūdreth articles, according
to the order of the Creede
of the Apoſtles:
                  written by that learned
and godly Martyr, I.
Hooper, ſometime Byſhop
of Gloceſter in his
life time.
                  Imprinted at London
by Chriſtopher Barker, Printer
to the Queenes moſt excellent
Maiestie.
                  
               
               
                  
                  THis Creede following, being made by
the reuerend Father Iohn Hooper, is deuided
into fiue principall partes. The firſt
whereof intreateth of God the father: the ſecond
of God the Sonne: the third of God the
holy Ghoſt: the fourth of the catholique
Church: the fift and laſt part entreateth of
the benefites or fruites, which we receiue by
the ſame fayth, which he maketh in number
three: the firſt is the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, the
ſecond is the reſurrection of the fleſhe. the
third &amp; laſt fruit is life euerlaſting. Of theſe
fiue parts, he hath made an hundreth ſeuerall
articles, the firſt parte conteyneth
14. The ſecond 27. The third
5. The fourth 41. The fifth and
laſt part conteyneth thirteene
articles, the contents
of which articles
are handeled,

                  A briefe and cleare confeſſion
of the Chriſtian faith, containing
an hundred articles, according
to the order of the
Creede of the Apoſtles.
                  
                     I beleeue in God the father almighty maker
of heauen and earth.
                     
                        The firſt Article.
                        
                           I Beleeue in one God onely,
one in eſſence and ſubſtance,
three in perſon, the Father,
ye Sonne, &amp; the holy Ghoſt.
I beleeue in the Father, as
the originall and beginning of all things,
as well viſible as inuiſible: Of whome alſo
they depende as well in their being, as alſo
in their conſeruation: and he dependeth vpon
none, but on him ſelfe, being eternall
and euerlaſting, without end or beginning.
I beleeue in the Sonne, as the diuine
worde and wiſdome of the father, which is
eternally, and before al worldes engendred
of the father, of his proper ſubſtance and
nature, becauſe in him ſhineth his ſhape and
proper Image, which otherwiſe is inuiſible

vnto mortal man. I beleeue in the holy
Ghoſt, as a vertue &amp; eternall power, which
neither is made, nor created, neither engendred,
but proceeding of the father and of
the ſonne eternally, euen as a loue proceeding
from both perſons.
                     
                     
                        The ſecond Article.
                        I beleeue that theſe three perſons are of
one, and the ſelfe ſame eſſence and ſubſtāce,
nature, authoritie, power, will, goodnes,
wiſdome, and eternitie, and that theſe three
are but one ſpirituall ſubſtance, eternall,
without ende or beginning, true, good, iuſt,
mercifull, of a ſouerayne power and wiſdome,
hauing and containing in it ſelfe all
goodnes, not needing any thing.
                     
                     
                        The third Article.
                        I beleeue that this God which is one in
eſſence, and three in perſon, ought onely to
be ſerued, honored, feared, loued, worſhipped,
and to be called vpon in all our neceſſities,
as he that onely can and will prouide
therefore, and none other. And therefore I
ſay and confeſſe, that I beleeue in one God
onely, that is to ſay, that I knowledge and
receiue him for one onely Lord, maſter, and
ſauiour, of whome proceedeth all that is
good in me, by whom I can do al things, &amp;

without whom I can do nothing. In him
onely doe I ſet mine affiance, and ſet mine
heart, hoping that he aſſiſting me with his
holy ſpirit, ſhall be with me againſt all mē,
and that he will deliuer me from al perils
and daungers through his grace and mercie,
without any merites of mine owne, and
that he ſhall miniſter to me all things neceſſarie,
as well for my ſoule as body, euen
like a good father, as hee hath promiſed by
his holy word.
                     
                     
                        The fourth Article.
                        I beleeue that the ſame God almightie
hath of nothing created from the beginning
both heauen and earth, and all things
in them conteined, that is to ſay, all things,
as well heauenly as earthly, viſible, as inuiſible,
reaſonable, as vnreaſonable, ſenſible,
as inſenſible, the which hee doth entertaine,
leade, guide, &amp; gouerne by his diuine
wiſdom, without whoſe prouidēce nothing
commeth to paſſe, either in this world or in
the other.
                     
                     
                        The fift Article.
                        I beleeue that the ſame God, the father,
the ſonne, and holy Ghoſt, after that hee
had created all things, did create and ſhape
man to his own image &amp; likenes, that is to

ſay, immortal, good, iuſt, true, wiſe, mercifull
and perfit in all things, making him
partaker of the goodnes, iuſtice, and other
perfections of God, hauing a will that
could agree in all things vnto the will of
his Lorde, but all that thorowe grace without
any kinde of merit.
                     
                     
                        The vi. article.
                        I beleeue alſo, that as the Lord hath created
al things heauenly and earthly, for the
ſeruice of man, and to the ende that by his
creatures he might come to ye knowledge
of the creator, euen ſo alſo hath he formed &amp;
made man for thim ſelfe, that of him, and by
him he might be knowen, loued, feared, ſerued
&amp; honored, which is the greateſt good
thing that is, or can be in man: and that in
him might ſhine the image of diuine vertues
and perfections through good works,
the which God hath ordeined, becauſe wee
ſhould walke in them vnto his honour and
praiſe, &amp; to the confuſion of the aduerſary:
and that by this meane, the fal of ye Angels
might be repaired, and that mā might poſſeſſe
the euerlaſting kingdome, made and
prepared for him before the foundations of
the worlde were laide.
                     
                     
                        
                        The vii. article.
                        I beleeue that the ſame man was ordeined
of the Lord God, a maſter &amp; ruler ouer
all his creatures: the which thing he hath
loſt through his ſinne, aſwell for his owne
part as alſo for al his poſteritie. The which
rule &amp; Lordſhip, I beleeue doth chiefly appertaine
vnto Ieſus Chriſt, verely God &amp;
man, &amp; to thoſe vnto whom he wil communicate
the ſame, as vnto his owne faithfull,
and not vnto the infidels and damned.
                     
                     
                        The viii. article.
                        I beleeue that the firſt man, through the
craft and ſubtiltie of Satan, did ſlide and
fall from the excellencie wherein the Lord
had created him, conſenting thorowe his
owne free will (which at that time he had)
vnto the ſubtil ſuggeſtion of the Serpent,
whereby he loſt the graces that the Lorde
had giuen him, in ſuch ſort, that of wiſe, hee
became fooliſh, of iuſt, vniuſt, of true, a liar,
of perfit, altogether vnperfect, hauing frō
thenceforth a will wholly corrupted, which
neither could nor would agree with the
will of God, but altogether with the wil of
the deuil, the worlde, the fleſh &amp; ſinne, which
could do nothing of him ſelfe but euill, ſeeing
that he is altogether carnal, bond, captiue,

and ſold vnder ſinne. This is the free,
yea to ſay more truely, the bond will that
man hath in this preſent life.
                     
                     
                        The ix. Article.
                        I beleeue yt this diſorder and corruption
of nature was not only in Adam, becauſe
of his ſinne, but is alſo in all men generally
which come of him, (Ieſus Chriſt only
excepted) and that in ſuch ſort, that all men
after their own nature are corrupt, vniuſt,
lyers, ignorant, vnkind, and imperfect in al
things, &amp; haue no power of their owne nature
to do, thinke, ſpeake, or will any thing
yt may pleaſe God, vntil yt they be regenerate,
&amp; renewed by the ſpirit of the Lord.
                     
                     
                        The x. Article.
                        I beleeue that this corruption of nature,
otherwiſe called original ſinne, is the fountayne
&amp; roote of all other ſinnes: for the
which all the miſeries &amp; aduerſities that
wee endure in this preſent life, aſwell in bodye
as ſoule, do come vnto vs, yea &amp; in the
end double death, that is to ſay, both of bodie
&amp; ſoule. Theſe be the fruites &amp; rewards
of ſinne. But although the ſame be due
&amp; common to all men generally, neuertheleſſe
the Lord through his mercy hath reſerued
to himſelfe a certaine nūber (which

are onely knowne to himſelfe) the which he
hath drawē from this corrupt heape, &amp; hath
ſanctified &amp; clenſed the ſame in the bloud of
his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; by meanes thereof
hath made them veſſels of election &amp; honour,
apt vnto all good workes.

                        I beleeue yt the Father in Ieſu Chriſt his
ſonne thorow the holy Ghoſt hath elected &amp;
choſē thoſe y• are his owne, according to his
good will, before the foundations of the
world were layed, whō he hath predeſtinate
vnto eternall life, yt there by they might be
his children adoptiues, ouer whom he hath
without compariſon, a much greater care
thē the beſt father can haue ouer ye beſt child
in the world: for he ſuffereth not that any
thing ſhall come to paſſe, either on high in
heauen, or beneath on earth, which ſhall not
be for their good and great profite.
                     
                     
                        The xii. Article.
                        I beleeue yt the father, through his ſonne,
wt the holy ghoſt, hath alwaies frō ye beginning
intended to reſtore mā: vnto whom after
he had ſinned, he ſhewed him ſelfe, promiſing
vnto him yt bleſſed ſeede, by whome
the heade of the ſerpent ſhould be troden
downe, and by whome the faithful ſhoulde
receyue bleſſing. By this promiſe (which

hath ſince bene oftentimes ratifyed, and
confirmed to the holie fathers) man (which
otherwiſe had diſpayred in ſinne,) is releeued,
holpen, comforted, and clothed with
hope, euen vnto the ful performing thereof.
                     
                     
                        The thirteenth Article.
                        I beleeue alſo, that after this promiſe
the Lorde hath preſcribed, and giuen the
lawe of the commandements to man, promiſing
life to the obſeruers therof, &amp; death
to the tranſgreſſours of the ſame: and hee
gaue them not to the ende that man ſhould
ſeeke iuſtification, ſaluation, or life therein:
but for the policie, peace, and tranquilytie
of his people, for the defence of the good,
for the chaſtenyng and punyſhing of the
wicked, &amp; to preſerue eche one in his office,
but eſpecially that therebye man might the
better know himſelfe, his diſeaſe, his pouertie
and imperfection: and by meane
thereof to take an occaſion, to humble himſelfe
before this lawe giuer, &amp; to ſeeke remedy,
ſaluation &amp; life in ſome other, that
is to ſaie, in the holie promiſed ſeede, which
is Ieſus Chriſt. For this cauſe the lawe is
called a ſcholemaſter to come to Chriſt,
the which alſo ſerueth vs for a glaſſe to
knowe our ſinnes by, and to encreaſe the

ſame knowledge in vs. Likewiſe it ſerueth
vs for an accuſer to accuſe vs before the
Lorde, and for a ſeuere and cruell iudge, to
declare the wrath and iudgement of God
ouer vs, and his condemnation vnto eternall
death, and by this meane to make vs
afraide, and to bring vs vnto diſpaire, vntill
we be comforted by the Goſpell, through
faith in Ieſus Chriſt, wherby we are deliuered
frō all theſe cauſes. Theſe are ye offices
of the lawe, the which are turned into our
good, through fayth in the Goſpell, the
which hath other offices, and cleane contrary.
For the reſt, I confeſſe that the lawe
of the Lorde is good, iuſt, holy, and perfit,
and where the ſame doth not bring vs vnto
perfection, it is not long of it ſelfe, but of
vs, which are altogether vnperfect, and can
in no wiſe accompliſh the ſame, no not to
touch it with our litle finger.
                     
                     
                        The xiiii. article.
                        I beleeue and confeſſe Ieſus Chriſt to
be the fulnes, the ende, and accompliſhmēt
of the Lawe, to the iuſtification of all that
beleeue, thorow whom, and by whom only,
all the promiſes of the father be accompliſhed,
yea, euen to the vttermoſt, the which
alſo alone hath perfectly ſatiſfied the

Lawe in that which no other amōgſt men
coulde perſourme, for ſo much as the law
doeth cōmaund things impoſſible, y• which
neuertheles mā muſt accōpliſh, not by working,
but through beleeuing. For ſo is the
lawe accompliſhed, through faith, and not
through works, &amp; by this meanes ſhal man
find ye righteouſnes of faith to be auaileable
before the Lord, &amp; not the righteouſneſſe of
works, y• which leadeth nothing vnto perfection.
                        As concerning the firſt poynt of my faith,
this is y• which I beleeue of the father, &amp; y•
things that are made by him, &amp; conſequētly
of the holie Trinitie, &amp; alſo of the ſoule
of man. Nowe let vs come to the ſecond
point, which is of the Sonne of God, and
of the thinges done by him, eſpecially of
the reſtoring, &amp; repairing agayne of man.
                     
                  
                  
                     2 And in Ieſus Chriſt his onely ſonne our Lorde, which
was cōceiued by the holy Ghoſt, borne of ye virgin Marie,
ſuffered vnder Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried,
he deſcēded into hel, the third day he roſe againe frō
the dead, he aſcended into heauen, and ſitteth on the right
hand of God the father almightie: from thence he ſhall
come, to iudge the quicke and the dead.
                     
                        The xv. Article.
                        I beleeue that Ieſus Chriſt is veryly
God, and verily man, hauing two natures
comprehended in one perſon, a nature diuyne,
(after the which he is the onely naturall

ſonne of God, equall with the father
in all thinges) and a nature humane, after
the which he is verye man in al things
like vnto vs, (ſynne excepted.)
                     
                     
                        The xvi. Article.
                        I beleeue that Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of
God, in the fulneſſe of the tyme appointed
of the father from the beginning, was ſent
into the worlde by the father, &amp; was made
perfect man, and was conceiued in the
wombe of a woman being a pure virgine,
called Marie, of her proper ſubſtance, &amp; of
her proper bloud, ſo yt he was found a perfect
man, deſcēding of ye ſeede of Adā, Noe,
Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob, Dauid &amp; other fathers,
vnto whome the promiſe was made.
                     
                     
                        The .xvii. Article.
                        I beleeue alſo, that all this was done
by the working of the holye Ghoſt, without
the worke of man, to the ende that all
that was wrought therein, might be holye,
and without ſpot, pure and cleane.
And that thereby our conception might be
made cleane &amp; holy, which of it ſelfe is altogether
ſpotted and defyled with ſinne.
                     
                     
                        The xviii. Article.
                        I beleeue that Ieſus Chriſt was
borne of the Virgyne Marye without

any manner of ſinne, and without breach of
her virginitie, ſo that by his pure and holye
natiuitie, he hath purified and made holye
ours, which of it ſelf is altogether vncleane
&amp; defyled with ſinne. In this Natiuitie of
Chriſt I ſee and conſider the firſt eſtate &amp;
condition of man, with his fall, which was
y• cauſe of Chriſt his cōming into ye world.
Likewiſe in this, I ſee and conſider the fauour
and ineſtimable loue of God the father,
which hath preſented, and giuen his
onely ſonne to ſerue vs. I ſee alſo and conſider
in this Natiuity, the charytie of the
ſonne, which hath abaſed &amp; humbled himſelfe,
to lifte vs vp, became poore to make
vs riche, became bonde, to make vs free,
&amp; became the ſonne of man to make vs the
children of God &amp; heires of eternal life. By
whoſe comming the nature of man is repaired
and made noble, and man that was
loſt and deſtroyed was thereby releeued &amp;
ſette in his perfection, and hath recouered
all that he hath loſt through ſinne, yea and
more. By the ſame meane alſo all the treaſures,
graces, and bleſſings of the Lorde,
are giuen &amp; communicated vnto man: but
all this through grace, without any merites.
                     
                     
                        
                        The nineteenth Article.
                        I beleeue alſo and confeſſe by the holy
ſcriptures an other conception and birth
of Ieſus Chriſt, which is ſpirituall, the
which (I ſay) is of no leſſe dignitye then the
firſt. The which is, that euery one that is
faithfull ought to conceaue into his heart
and ſpirite Ieſus Chriſt, through a trewe
and liuely faith, and to bring him foorth
by open confeſſing of him with his mouth
as often and when ſoeuer it ſhalbe needefull.
I doe eſteeme this conception, and natiuitie
to be ſo neceſſary to ſaluation, that
if the virgin Mary, had not more bleſſedly
borne Ieſus Chriſt in her heart and ſpirit,
then in her belly, her carnall motherhoode
would haue profited her little. By, and for
this cauſe are we called mothers, brethren,
and ſiſters of Ieſus Chriſt.
                     
                     
                        The twentieth Article.
                        I beleeue that the ſame Ieſus Chriſt is
verely Chriſt, yt is to ſay, the Meſſias, annoynted
by ye holy Ghoſt, becauſe he was y•
very king, ye Prophet, and great ſacrificer,
that ſhould ſacrifice for all that beleeue: the
which alſo is promiſed in the Law, and is y•
ſame of whom al the Prophets haue ſpokē.
This annoynting of Chriſt is not corporall

of a material and viſible oyle, as was that
of the kynges, Prieſtes, and Prophetes
in tymes paſt, but it is ſpirituall, of an inuiſible
oyle, which is the grace &amp; giftes of the
holy Ghoſt, wherewith he is repleniſhed aboue
all others. So that this anoynting
is deſcended euen vnto vs, which haue felt
and proued the ſweetneſſe thereof: and by
it alſo we beare the name of Chriſtiās, that
is to ſay, anoynted.
                     
                     
                        The xxi. Article.
                        I beleeue that this ſacrificing of Ieſus
Chriſt was not Leuiticall, or carnal, to immolate,
offer vp, and to ſacrifice beaſtes,
kyne, and other ſenſible thinges, as did Aaron
&amp; his ſucceſſours: but ſpiritual, to offer
and ſacrifice himſelfe, that is to ſay, his body
&amp; bloud for the remiſſion of the ſinnes
of the whole worlde. Euen as likewiſe his
kingdome is not of this world, carnall, but
ſpiritual, which conſiſteth in the guyding
&amp; gouerning of his owne by his holy ſpirit,
ouer whome he raigneth by his worde, and
that to the deſtruction of al his aduerſaries,
which are ſinne, death, hell, Satan, and
all infideles, wicked and reprobate.
                     
                     
                        
                        The xxii. Article.
                        I beleeue that Ieſus Chriſt hath verely
exerciſed theſe three offices, that is to ſaye,
of a Prophete, of a King, and a ſacrificer,
not onely in this worlde, being a mortall
man as we are, but alſo that he exerciſeth
yet daily the ſame in heauen before the face
of the father, where he ſitteth and appeareth
continually for vs, and from thence by his
holy Spirit doeth teach, helpe, maynteine,
and defende his owne: and therefore is hee
called a Prophete, a King, and a great Sacrificator
after ye order of Melchiſedek, that
is to ſay, eternall, and not after the order of
Aaron, which had his ende with the Lawe.
                     
                     
                        The xxiii. Article.
                        I beleeue that the ſame Ieſus Chriſt (after
that hee had preached the Goſpel in the
countrey of Iudea and Galilee, by the ſpace
of three yeres or there about, &amp; declared him
ſelf to be the naturall Sonne of God, aſwel
by his marueilous workes, as by his words,
and the writings of the Prophets) was vniuſtly
and falſely accuſed by the Prieſtes,
whom when they had taken, and in their
counſell vniuſtly had condemned him to

death, they brought him bound to Pilate the
Prouoſt then at Hieruſalem: who at the
inſtance of the ſayde Prieſtes dyd vniuſtly,
wrongfully, and without cauſe condemne
him to death, and that the moſt horrible and
ſlaunderous death that coulde be imagined
or deuiſed, that is to ſaye, to be put on the
croſſe, crucified betweene two theeues, as
if hee had bene their Prince and Captaine:
The which thing hee ſuffered and endured
willingly and innocently without deſeruing
the ſame. For otherwiſe coulde he not
haue ſatiſfied for vs, neither could his croſſe
haue profited vs.
                     
                     
                        The xxiiii. Article.
                        I beleeue alſo that while hee was vpon
the ſayd croſſe dying and giuing vp his ſpirite
vnto God his Father, he deſcended into
hell, that is to ſay, He did verily taſte and
feele the great diſtreſſe and heauineſſe of
death, and likewiſe the paynes and tormentes
of hell, That is to ſay, the great
wrath and ſeuere iudgement of God vpon
him, euen as if God had vtterly forſaken
him, yea as though God had beene his extreeme
enemie, ſo that hee was conſtrayned

with loude voyce to crye, My God,
my God, why haſt thou forſaken me. This
is ſimply my vnderſtanding of Chriſt his
deſcending into hell. And beſides, I knowe
well that this article hath not from the beginning
bene in the Creede, and that many
others haue otherwiſe both vnderſtanded
and interpreted it, which eſteeme that
Chriſt verely and in deede deſcended into
hell, to the place of the damned, alledging
the text of Saint Peter: the which I confeſſe
is yet couered and hid from me. The
Lorde vouchſafe to open the gate vnto vs,
and to giue vs an entrance into ſuch myſteries.
                     
                     
                        The xxv. Article.
                        I beleeue that all this was done, not for
him ſelfe, which neuer committed ſinne, in
whoſe mouth was neuer founde deceite nor
lie, but for the loue of vs poore and miſerable
ſinners, whoſe place he occupied vpon
the croſſe, as a pledge, or one that repreſented
the perſon of all the ſinners that euer
were, be nowe, or ſhall be vnto the worldes
ende. And becauſe they through their ſinnes
haue deſerued to feele &amp; taſt of the extreme

paynes of death, to be forſaken of God, and
of all creatures, to feele the wrath and ſeuere
iudgement of God vpon them, Chriſt
which was their pledge ſatiſfying for them
vpon the croſſe, hath fealt and endured all
the ſame, and that altogether to make vs
free, to deliuer vs from all theſe paynes,
from the wrath and iudgement of GOD,
from condemnation and eternall death.
And I doe clearely reiect and eſteeme as
fables all the Limbos of the fathers, and of
yong children, Purgatorie, and ſuch other
like, to bee follyes, mockeries, and abuſes
which are inuented and founde out by
man, without the worde of the Lord. For
I neyther beleeue, nor receyue more then
two places in the worlde to come, that is to
ſay, heauen for the faythfull and elect with
the angels, and hell for the infidels &amp; reprobate
with the deuils.
                     
                     
                        The xxvi. Article.
                        I beleeue and conſider this death and
paſſion, euen as I doe all other myſteries
of Ieſus Chriſt, not onely as touching the
hiſtorie, as a paterne and example to followe,
as was that of the holy men and women
which are dead for the Lordes quarell:

but alſo principally as touching the cauſe,
fruites, and vſes thereof, thereby to knowe
the greatneſſe of my sinnes, the grace and
mercie of the Father, and the charitie of
the Sonne, by whome wee are reconciled
vnto GOD, deliuered from the tyrannie
of the deuill, and reſtored to the
libertie of the ſpirite. This is the glaſſe
without ſpotte, to teache vs to knowe
our filthineſſe, the lauer, or cleare fountayne
to waſh and clenſe vs, the infinite
treaſure to ſatiſfie all our creditours: Of
whome and by whome onely the diuine iuſtice
is fully ſatiſfied for all the ſinnes of
all that haue beene, be nowe, or ſhall bee
vnto the ende of the worlde: And therefore
I doe beleeue and confeſſe, that Chriſt his
condemnation is mine abſolution, that his
crucifying is my deliuerance, his deſcending
into hell, is mine aſcending into heauen,
his death is my life, his blood is
my clenſing and purging, by whome onely
I am waſhed, purified and clenſed from
all my ſinnes, ſo that I neyther receyue,
neyther beleeue, any other Purgatorie
eyther in this worlde, or in the other,
whereby I may bee purged, but onely

the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, by the which all
are purged and made cleane for euer.
                     
                     
                        The xxvii. Article.
                        I beleeue that Ieſus Chriſt by the ſacrifice
of his bodie which hee offered vpon
the tree of the croſſe, hath defaced and deſtroyed
ſinne, death, and the deuill, with all
his kingdome, and hath wholie performed
the woorke of our ſaluation, and hath aboliſhed
and made an ende of all other ſacrifices:
So that from thence foorth there is
none other propiciatorie ſacrifice, eyther
for the liuing or the dead, to bee looked for
or ſought for, thē the ſame. For by this one
onely oblation hath he conſecrated for euer,
all thoſe that are ſanctified.
                     
                     
                        The xxviii. Article.
                        I beleeue that the holy Supper of the
Lorde is not a ſacrifice, but onely a remembrance
and commemoration of this holy ſacrifice
of Ieſus Chriſt: Therefore it ought
not to be worſhipped as GOD, neyther
as Chriſt therein conteyned: who muſt bee
worſhipped in fayth onely, without all corruptible

elements. Likewiſe I beleeue
and confeſſe, that the Popiſh maſſe is the
inuention and ordinance of man, a ſacrifice
of Antichriſt, and a forſaking of the ſacrifice
of Ieſus Chriſt, that is to ſay, of his death
and paſſion: and that it is a ſtinking and infected
ſepulchre, which hideth and couereth
the merite of the blood of Chriſt, and
therefore ought the maſſe to bee aboliſhed,
and the holy Supper of the Lorde to be reſtored
and ſet in his perfection againe.
                     
                     
                        The xxix. Article.
                        I beleeue alſo that as the Prophete Ionas
was in the Whales bellie, (which is a
place of corruption) three dayes and three
nyghtes, without being corrupted, and
the thirde daye came out of him alyue without
any maner of hurte: Euen ſo Ieſus
Chriſt after hee was dead, was layed and
put in a newe Sepulchre, (which is a
place of corruption) in the which hee was
three dayes and three nyghtes, not touched
with any kynde of infection of fylthineſſe
or corruption, but continued in
his perfection, to declare the vertue of his
blood, to accompliſh the wrytings of the

holy Prophetes, and to verifie the trueth
aſwell of his bodie, as of his death: with
whome I beleeue that the lawe was buryed,
abrogated, and aboliſhed as touching
the faythfull, not as the acquiting
of an obligation whereby they ſhoulde
bee no more bounde to lyue, and walke
therein: but onely as concerning condemnation,
that is to ſaye, that the tranſgreſſion
of the Lawe condemneth them not before
the iudgement ſeate of GOD, becauſe
of their fayth which they haue in Ieſus
Chriſt. And therefore with in one
Sepulchre, I doe comprehend three things
to bee buried, That is to ſaye, Chriſt, the
Lawe, and all the faythfull which ought to
be crucified and buried with Chriſt, through
the mortification of their fleſh.
                     
                     
                        The xxx. Article.
                        I beleeue that as Ieſus Chriſt was
put to death for our ſinnes, ſo alſo hee
roſe agayne the thirde daye for our iuſtification
vnto euerlaſting life, wherein
hee hath openly declared him ſelfe
both GOD and man, obtayning the
victorie ouer all his aduerſaries, and

hath confounded and beaten downe all his
enemies, that is to ſay, the worlde, ſinne,
death, hell, and Satan, not for him ſelfe, but
for vs that beleeue in him, knowing that
his victorie is ours, and that in him and
by him wee ouercome the ſelfe ſame enemies,
obtayning the victorie ouer them
vnto the honour of the Lorde, and our great
profite.
                     
                     
                        The xxxi. Article.
                        I beleeue and conſider this reſurrection
of Ieſus Chriſt not onely as an hyſtorie,
as was that of Lazarus and other ſuch like
which miraculouſly were rayſed vp by the
vertue of the Lorde, but alſo as the example
and cauſe efficient of my ryſing againe,
and as the earneſt and firſt fruites of the generall
reſurrection of all that beleeue.
That as Ieſus Chriſte was rayſed vp the
thyrde day after his death vnto eternall
lyfe thorowe his diuine vertue: Euen ſoe
by the ſame vertue, I hope one day to bee
rayſed vp in bodye and ſoule vnto eternall
lyfe, after that I haue here in this
worlde beene rayſed vp in ſpirite thorowe

liuely and true faith in newnes of life, mortifiyng
and crucifiyng the fleſhe with the affections
and concupiſcences of the worlde,
the which ought to bee dead and crucified to
vs, and wee to it. For wee are buried with
Chriſte in his death thorowe Baptiſme, to
the ende that as hee is riſen from death by
the glorie of the father, without dying any
more, euen ſo wee ſhoulde walke in neweneſſe
of life without ſeruing of ſinne any
more, ſearching alwayes principally for the
thinges that are on high, heauenly and eternall,
and forſaking the earthly and tranſitorie
thinges of the worlde, knowing that wee
haue not here an abyding Citie, but that we
muſt ſeeke for that which is to come.

                        I beleeue and confeſſe that Ieſus Chriſt
the fourtieth day after his reſurrection, viſibly
and before all his Apoſtles did aſcende
into heauen, that is to ſaye, in the maieſtie
of his father in glory and eternal felicitie, in
the which hee was, before hee came into this
miſerable worlde, to become man, yea euen
before the foundation of the worlde was

layde, that is to ſay, from euerlaſting.
                     
                     
                        The xxxiii. Article.
                        I beleeue that he is aſcended into heauen,
to accompliſhe and to fyniſhe all thinges,
and to open heauen for vs, that wee might
aſcende after him and followe him as our
head, to bee eternally knitte with him in
glorie, the which thing here wee beginne
thorowe fayth. In like maner hee hath
done the ſame, for the benefite of his
Churche that hee might ſende vnto his
Apoſtles that comforter, that hee promiſed
them, by the which they were comforted,
inſtructed and guided in all trueth, and there
by is his Church ſupported, maintayned,
and defended againſt all the blaſtes of Satan
and all the gates of Hell.
                     
                     
                        The xxxiiii. Article.
                        I beleeue alſo that hee is aſcended into
heauen to bee our Patrone, interceſſour,
mediatour and aduocate, and that hee
nowe appeareth for vs before the face of the
father, obtayning for vs grace and abundance

of all good thinges, in ſuch ſorte that
I neither knowledge nor receiue anye
other mediatour betwixt GOD and
man, neyther any other aduocate or interceſſour
before GOD the father, then his
onely ſonne Ieſus Chriſte our Lorde. To
him doe I reſorte, with him doe I holde my
ſelfe contented, and none other doe I ſearch
for, neyther will I, fearyng to blaſpheme
the name of GOD by giuyng that vnto
the creature, that appertayneth onely to the
Creator, and to the ſeruant that, which onely
apperteyneth vnto the maſter.
                     
                     
                        The xxxv. Article.
                        I beleeue that all they which demaunde,
ſeeke for, or receyue any other mediator,
interceſſour, or aduocate towardes GOD
the father then Ieſus Chriſt his Sonne, the
ſame blaſphemeth agaynſt God, and doeth
diſhonour vnto Ieſus Chriſt, and vnto the
ſaintes by whom he prayeth. For as God
the father wil bee knowen, ſerued, loued,
feared and honoured in his Sonne, and by
his onely ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, and not by any
other meanes: euen ſo will hee be prayed
vnto and called vpon in his and by his onely
Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, and none other wiſe.

In this I will neither diſpraiſe, nor thinke
or ſpeake euil of the bleſſed Saintes which
are in heauen with the Lord: but I wil haue
them in honour, and reuerence them as the
faythfull ſaints of the Lord, as the Temple
of the holy Ghoſt, &amp; as the true members of
Chriſt, and haue them as glaſſes &amp; paterns
before myne eyes, to followe them aſwel in
their honeſt life &amp; good conuerſation, as alſo
in their faythfull and holy doctrine. And as
concerning them, or by thē I do vnderſtand
none other thing, knowing that al my good,
my helpe, and ſuccour proceedeth of God
onely, by the meane of Ieſus Chriſt alone,
which hath made the Saintes worthie of
his glorie by his onely grace, by the which
alſo I beleeue hee will make mee worthie
with them to bee their companion in glory,
that wee all together ſhoulde giue vnto
him onelyall honour, prayſe and glorie for
euermore.
                     
                     
                        The xxxvi. Article.
                        I beleeue that the ſame Ieſus Chriſt is
ſet on the right hande of God the father almightie,
that is to ſay, that he reigneth in
one, and the ſame maieſtie and equall power
with God his father, by the which hee ſo gouerneth

his owne vnto the worldes ende,
that the power of none aduerſarie can annoye
them without his permiſſion and will.
I beleeue alſo that the Father hath made
him Lorde and ruler ouer all creatures, as
well heauenly as earthly, giuing vnto him
all power ouer heauen and earth, and that
he hath lift him vp aboue all rule, power,
and Lordſhip, and aboue euery name that
is named, not onlie in this worlde, but alſo
in the worlde to come: and hath made all
thinges ſubiect vnder his feete, and hath
appointed him ouer all thinges, to bee the
head of his Church which is his body,
Ephe. 1. 21. And therfore I neither receiue,
neither acknowledge any other Head of the
Church, but onely Ieſus Chriſt, which hath
giuen his blood to waſh away the filthines,
and to heale the woundes thereof, and the
ſame to preſerue, nouriſh, defende and gouerne
by his holy ſpirite. The ſame is the
onely Head and foundation of the Church,
whereon euery one ought to builde according
to his vocacion.
                     
                     
                        The xxxvii. Article.
                        I beleeue that Ieſus Chriſt is aſcended into

heauen, and that hee is there corporally,
that is to ſay, in fleſhe, in body, and
in ſoule, after ſuch ſorte that hee neither is
nor can after the ſame meane and faſhion be
here beneath on earth with vs, for as much
as his body, although it bee glorious, can
not bee in diuers and many places at one
time, but be ſo in one place after the nature
of a glorified bodie, that it can not bee in an
other: otherwiſe it ſhoulde not bee a true
and naturall bodie, but phantaſticall, that
is to ſay, a thing apparant and not in deede,
which is falſe and wholye agaynſt our faith.
And therefore doe I ſaye and confeſſe, that
the true and naturall bodye of Chriſte is
in heauen, and that from thence hee ſhall
not come vntyll hee hath made all his enemies
his footeſtoole, and then ſhall hee
come to iudge the quicke and dead.
                     
                     
                        The xxxviii. Article.
                        I beleeue that when the number of the
electe children of GOD ſhall bee accompliſhed,
the Lorde Ieſus in the ſelfe
ſame bodie in the which hee ſuffered

and was crucified, with the which hee
roſe and aſcended into heauen, in the
ſelfe ſame ſhall hee come with great power
and Maieſtie, viſiblye in a cloude,
euen as hee aſcended, and that to iudge
both the quicke and the dead, and ſhall
render vnto euery one according to iuſtice,
vnto the good that hee ſhall finde amongſt
them, according to their goodneſſe, and
vnto the euill according to their wickedneſſe.
This iudgement ſhall bee general,
that is to ſaye, all ſhall bee called and
perſonally ſummoned therevnto by the
voyce of an Angell: at the which all
ſhall appeare, as well the good as the
euyll, the electe as the reprooued, to
the ende that euery one maye render an
accompt and reckonyng before the iudgement
ſeate of Chriſte, of all that hath
beene done by them in this worlde, whether
it be good or euill, yea euen of their
idle woordes, the which they eſteeme no
ſinne. Then ſhalbe ſaued all thoſe that are
founde written in the booke of life.
                     
                     
                        The xxxix. Article.
                        A beleeue that then ſhalbe made the total
and laſt ſeparation of the good from the euill,
of the elect from the reprobate, the

which now are all mingled together as the
good and the euil fiſh in one nette, the chaffe
and the corne, &amp; the cockle with the wheate:
but when the harueſt commeth, hee which
hath the fanne in his hand, ſhal make a ſeparation,
and ſhall gather the corne into his
garner, but the chaffe and cockle he ſhal caſt
into the fire, to burne eternally. Then ſhall
perfitly be declared and knowen the iuſtice
and mercy of the Lorde, and likewiſe the
fruite of the croſſe &amp; blood of Ieſus Chriſt,
the which thing nowe we knowe onely but
in parte, but then the good and elect ſhall
knowe the Father, vpon whome they haue
buylded their hope, and ſhal not be confounded:
&amp; in like maner the wicked ſhal knowe
the Father, againſt whome they haue ſtumbled,
&amp; whom they haue refuſed, contemned
and deſpiſed, and ſhalbe confounded. Then
ſhall the Lorde make an ende of his office
and miniſterie: for his myſticall body ſhall
then be wholly finiſhed and accompliſhed,
with all his members, and he ſhal render vp
his kingdome, and his eſpouſe, which is the
Church, vnto God his Father, altogether
glorious, irreprehenſible and acceptable,
without ſpotte or wrinkle. Then ſhall perfectly
be ouercome, deſtroyed, and confounded

Satan and hell, ſinne and death, and all
other aduerſaries of Chriſt, the which preſently
doe yet exerciſe tyrannie vpon all
his members, and holde them vnder their
clawes, chaynes and bondes. But then we,
as people rauiſhed with ioye, ſhall ſaye this
worde which is written: O death, where is
thy victorie? Thankes be vnto God, which
hath giuen vs victorie, thorow Ieſus Chriſt
our Lorde.
                     
                     
                        The xl. Article.
                        I beleeue that this maruaylous, terrible,
and fearefull iudgement vnto the euill,
wicked and reprobate, is very much
deſired, and of great conſolation vnto the
good, the faithfull, and the elect, becauſe
that then their whole redemption, that is
to ſaye, of the bodie, ſhall bee made an
ende of, and they ſhall receyue the fruite
of their labours. Then their innocencie
ſhall openly bee declared and knowen to
all the worlde, and they ſhall ſee the vengeance
and condemnation of the wicked,
which haue vſed them tyrannouſly, afflicted,
and tormented them in this worlde,
whoſe iniquitie ſhall bee manifeſted by the
Lorde, and ſhalbe clearely knowen of all, to

their great confuſion, and to the honour and
glory of the righteous children of God, the
which ſhall be in peace and perfite tranquillitie,
and ſhall haue full reioyſing and fruition
of all that he hath promiſed and prepared
for all thoſe that loue him, the which no
eye hath ſeene, no eare hath heard, neyther
can bee comprehended by the heart of man.
Therefore doe I abyde this great daye of
retribution with a great deſire, as the ſame
which ſhall bring and ſhewe vnto mee the
ſelfe ſame good thing.
                     
                     
                        The xli. Article.
                        I beleeue that we ſhall not all dye, but
that we ſhall bee chaunged in a moment,
that is to ſaye, that in this laſt daye and
iudgement generall, ſome ſhall be founde
aliue, the which dyed not, neyther ſhall
they die, as concerning the ſeparation of the
bodie from the ſoule, but ſhall continue
aliue eternally, to the ende that Chriſt may
be knowen to bee Lorde and Iudge of the
liuing and dead, and that his grace and merites
may be found greater then the ſinne of
Adam. For as ſinne hath raygned vnto
death: ſo likewiſe muſt grace raygne thorowe
Ieſus Chriſt vnto eternall life. The

ſame neuertheleſſe ſhall be changed &amp; tranſformed
from corruption vnto incorruption,
from mortalitie vnto immortalitie, from
contempt and ignominie vnto glory, after
ſuch ſort, that they ſhalbe made partakers of
all the giftes, graces, &amp; benefites, the which
the Lorde ſhall giue vnto thoſe, that before
were dead in him: the which ſhall not be before
the others, but all together ſhalbe taken
vp in the cloudes, and in the ayre, and ſhall
all together be with the Lord.
                        This is the ſecond poynt of my faith, touching
Ieſus Chriſt, the ſeconde perſon in
Trinitie, and of his reſtoring and repayring
of man: let vs nowe come to the third
poynt, which is of the holy Ghoſt, by whom
man (beyng reſtored) is mayntayned and
preſerued in his integritie and perfection.
                     
                  
                  
                     3. I beleeue in the holy Ghoſt, the holie
Catholike Church, the communion of Saints,
the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, the reſurrection of
the bodie, and the life euerlaſting, Amen.
                     
                        The xlii. Article.
                        I beleeue that the holy Ghoſt is a diuine
perſon, diſtinct from the Father and the

Sonne, proceeding from them both, in and
through all thinges equall and coeternall
with them: by the which holy Ghoſt, the
Church hath alwayes bene, is nowe, and
ſhall be ruled, guyded, directed and gouerned
vnto the ende of the worlde: By whome
alſo all the Saintes, Patriarkes, Prophets
and Apoſtles of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt
haue ſpoken. And therefore I do neither beleeue
nor receiue any other Vicar or Lieutenant
to Chriſt vpon earth within his
Church, then this holy Ghoſt, which can
not be receiued of the wicked.
                     
                     
                        The xliii. Article.
                        I beleeue, that ye holy Ghoſt is the pledge
and earneſt of our heauenly heritage, by the
which we be aſſured, aſcertained, and certainly
perſwaded in our conſciences, that
we be the children of God, &amp; brethren adoptiues
to Ieſus Chriſt, and conſequently coheires
of eternal life. The ſame holy Ghoſt
alſo is the finger of God, the which imprinteth
in our heartes and ſpirites the faith of
theſe things aforeſaide: It ſealeth and confirmeth
the promiſes of the Lord within our
hearts, thorowe his goodnes and grace, becauſe
we ſhould in no wiſe doubt.
                     
                     
                        
                        The xliii. Article.
                        I beleeue that this holy Spirit dwelling
in vs, through his grace and vertue doth regenerate
vs into a newneſſe &amp; change of liuing,
mortifying in vs, all that is of vs, and
of the old man, of the fleſh, and of the world,
and quickening al that is his in vs: So that
we liue not thenceforth after our own luſts,
but according to ye wil of God. Which holy
Ghoſt alſo worketh in vs all good workes,
and doeth reprooue, rebuke &amp; condemne the
world of ſinne, of righteouſnes, &amp; iudgemēt.
                     
                     
                        The xlv. Article.
                        I beleeue that the holy Ghoſt is the teacher
of the ignorant, which teacheth, guydeth,
and leadeth vs vnto the knowledge of
the trueth, and by it onely are we brought &amp;
deliuered out of darkenes, &amp; ſet in the perfit
light. Likewiſe I beleeue that it is the comforter
of the poore afflicted &amp; perſecuted, &amp;
in all their troubles, vexations and aduerſities
doeth ſo helpe, ſtrengthen, comfort, and
aſſiſt all ſuch, that it will not ſuffer them to
deſpaire, as doe the wicked &amp; reprobate, but
maketh them to taſte and feele the ſweetenes,
goodnes, &amp; mercy of God the Father,
which by perſecution and diuers tribulations,
leadeth his owne vnto eternall glory.
                     
                     
                        
                        The xlvi. Article.
                        I beleeue that this holy Ghoſt, is the ſpirit
of life, which quickeneth al other ſpirits,
as well heauenly as earthly, &amp; that the ſame
only of it ſelfe is holy, &amp; that all others by it
are made holy: So that if any ſpirits be holy,
(as there be) either in heauen or in earth,
they are none otherwiſe holy, but by the holines
of the ſame holy Ghoſt, and that is the
cauſe, why I beleeue in him, that is to ſaye,
for that cauſe I put my whole faith, hope,
truſt &amp; affiance in him, euen as I haue ſayd
before of the Father &amp; the Sonne. This is
the third poynt of my faith, which is concerning
the holy Ghoſt, the third perſon in the
holy Trinitie, by the which holy Ghoſt, after
that we are made by the Father, and repaired
and reſtored by the Sonne, wee are
maynteyned and gouerned vnto the ende.
There remayneth nowe, to entreate of the
fourth poynt of my faith, which is concerning
the Church, and of the things that concerne
the ſame.
                     
                  
                  
                     4. I beleeue the holy Catholike Church,
the Communion of Saintes.
                     I beleeue and confeſſe one onely Catholike
&amp; Vniuerſal Church, which is an holy

congregation &amp; aſſemblie of all faithful beleeuers,
which are choſen &amp; predeſtinate vnto
euerlaſting life, before the foundations of
the worlde were layde, of whoſe nomber I
count my ſelfe, &amp; beleeue that I am through
the onely grace and mercy of the Father, &amp;
by the merits of my good Lord and Maſter
Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; not by meanes of my good
workes &amp; merites, which in deede are none.
                     
                        The xlviii. Article.
                        I beleeue, that this Church is inuiſible
to the eye of man, &amp; is onely to God knowen,
&amp; that the ſame Church is not ſet, compaſſed
and limited within a certaine place,
or boundes, but is ſcattered &amp; ſpread abroad
throughout all the worlde: but yet coupled
together in heart, will, and ſpirite, by the
bond of faith &amp; charitie, hauing and altogether
knowledging one onely God, one only
head and Mediator Ieſus Chriſt, one faith,
one lawe, one Baptiſme, one ſpiritual Table,
wherein one meate, and one ſpirituall
drinke is miniſtred to them, vnto the ende of
the worlde. This Church contayneth in it
all the righteous and choſen people, from
the firſt righteous mā, vnto the laſt that ſhal
be found righteous in the end of the world,
and therefore doe I call it Vniuerſall. For

as touching the Viſible Church, which is
the Congregation of the good and of the
wicked, of the choſen and of the reprobate, &amp;
generally of al thoſe which ſay, they beleue
in Chriſt, I doe not beleeue that to bee
the Church, becauſe that Church is ſeene of
the eye, and the faith thereof is in viſible
things.
                     
                     
                        The xlix. Article.
                        I beleeue that this Inuiſible Church is
the fielde of the Lorde God, wherein is neyther
darnell nor cockle: it is the houſe and
dwelling place of the holy Ghoſt, and within
that Church is neither Cain, Iudas, neither
the wicked rich Gluttō. That Church
alſo is the fold of Chriſt, wherein is no ſtinking
and infected beaſtes, but all cleane and
vndefiled ſheepe and lambes, which bring
forth their fruites in due time &amp; ſeaſon. The
ſame Church is the body of Chriſt, wherein
there is neuer a rotten, corrupt, or infected
mēber. It is the Spouſe of Chriſt, which is
pure &amp; cleane, without wrinckle, &amp; without
ſpot. It is holy &amp; without blame, cleanſed,
and ſanctified in the blood, and by the worde
of her head and welbeloued ſpouſe Ieſus
Chriſt, &amp; for that cauſe they cā in no wiſe periſh,
which by liuely faith are grafted therin.
                     
                     
                        
                        The L. Article.
                        I beleeue that the gifts and graces of the
holy Ghoſt, are ſcattered and giuen vnto euery
member of the ſame Church, not ſo
much for their particular profite &amp; commoditie,
as for the general profit &amp; commoditie
of the whole Congregation &amp; Church, and
that thorow grace wholy, without any merite,
according to the good pleaſure &amp; prouidence
of God, to ſome more, to ſome leſſe, &amp;
that to ye end we ſhould know, that one hath
neede of another, and that we ſhould be ready
to helpe one another in all neceſſities, as
wel bodily as ſpiritually, euen as it becommeth
members of one body.
                     
                     
                        The Li. Article.
                        I beleeue the Communion of Saintes,
that is to ſay, I beleeue that all, whatſoeuer
our Lorde God giueth in this worlde, whether
it be benefites and bleſſings, that concerne
the body or the ſpirit, he giueth ye ſame
ſingularly to the profit &amp; commoditie of the
whole Church, and therfore ought the ſame
to be diſtributed &amp; communicated to all that
are faithful, but chiefely to thoſe that are in
neceſſitie, that like as we doe communicate
and are knitte in one God, one faith, one
Lawe, one Baptiſme, and be partakers of

one ſpirituall Table, euen ſo we may communicate
&amp; be partakers together of, and in
thoſe things, which do proceede &amp; come vnto
vs, by meanes of the aforeſayde thinges.
For otherwiſe we can not be Chriſtians or
faithfull ſtewardes of Chriſt. Here vtterly
I renounce and abhorre the Anabaptiſtes
maner of making common goods, wiues,
and ſuch other like things, and onely doe I
allow the Apoſtles making of things common,
which hauing &amp; poſſeſſing any goods
priuately, vſed to diſtribute thereof, to euery
one, according as the ſame had neede, and as
neceſſitie required.
                     
                     
                        The Lii. Article.
                        I beleeue that this Church is like vnto
the Arke of Noah, within the which is ſafetie
and life, and without the ſame is but
death, decay and deſtruction. For as Chriſt
is and doeth raygne in his Church, euen ſo
Satan is and doeth raygne in, and through
all that are out of that Church: The which
true Church is mayntayned and vpholden
by the Spirite of Chriſt, is ruled and gouerned
by his holy worde, and is nouriſhed
and fedde with his holy Sacraments. That
Church ſhal alwayes haue enemies, &amp; ſhall
ſtill be tormented in ye ſea of this world with

the thunderings of Antichriſt, and by the
wounds and tempeſt of Satan. For all the
gates of hell doe arme &amp; ſet out themſelues
againſt this Church. But in theſe waues
ſhee ſhall not be drowned, but ſhall abide for
euer, becauſe ſhee hath a good defence and
foundatiō, which is Ieſus Chriſt the righteous.
And for this cauſe I cal her ye Church
militāt, which wayteth for ye triūph of thoſe

but peace, ioy, and euerlaſting conſolation.

                        I beleeue that the Lord God hath giuen
vs three principal ſignes and marks, by the
which we may knowe this his Church, that
is to ſay, the word, the Sacraments, &amp; diſcipline.
I call that only the word, which was
reuealed by the holy Ghoſt vnto the holie
Patriarks, Prophets, &amp; Apoſtles of Ieſus
Chriſt, the which word is cōtained within ye
canonicall bookes of the olde &amp; new Teſtamēt:
by the which word we are made cleane,
&amp; thereby do receiue ye ſelfe ſame thing, &amp; as
much as we do by the Sacramentes, that is
to ſay, Ieſus Chriſt by his worde, which is
the worde of faith, giueth &amp; communicateth
himſelfe vnto vs, aſwell as by the Sacramēts,
albeit it be by another maner &amp; faſhiō.
                     
                     
                        
                        The Liiii. Article.
                        I beleeue, that the ſame worde of God
is of a farre greater aucthoritie then the
Church, the which worde onely doeth ſufficiently
ſhewe and teach vs all thoſe things
yt in any wiſe concerne our ſaluation, both
what we ought to do, and what to leaue vndone.
The ſame worde of God is the true
paterne and perfect rule, after the which all
faithful people ought to gouerne and order
their liues, without turning eyther to the
right hand, or to the left hand, without chā
                           ging
any thing thereof, without putting to
it, or taking from it, knowing yt all ye works
of god are perfect, but moſt chiefly his word
                     
                     
                        The Lv. Article.
                        I beleeue, that as onely Ieſus Chriſt amongſt
all men is holie and true, &amp; that all
others are ſinners and lyers, euen ſo likewiſe
the onely doctrine of the ſame Ieſus
Chriſt is holy and true, &amp; al other doctrines
are vnpure &amp; falſe. This doctrine of Ieſus
Chriſt, is a well, a fountaine of life, a lampe
or pillar of fire to guyde vs, the bread of the
ſoule, &amp; the power of God vnto ſaluation,
to al that beleeue: And therfore whatſoeuer
happeneth, the ſame ought onely to bee aduaunced,
preached, heard, vnderſtande &amp; receiued

of all the worlde, to the comfort and
ſaluation of thoſe that beleue, &amp; to the greater
damnation of the vnbeleeuers, the wicked
and reprobate that beleeue not. For as
the Manna in the deſert was to ſome ſowre▪
&amp; to other ſome a good and pleaſant meate,
and as Chriſt is to ſome a ſtumbling ſtone
to be offended at, &amp; is appointed for ye fall of
ye wicked, &amp; the riſing vp of the godly, euē ſo
the word of the Goſpel to ſome is a ſauor of
death vnto death, &amp; to other ſome a ſauor of
life vnto life. The which worde of ye Goſp

                        I beleeue yt the reading of the ſame word
&amp; Goſpel ought not, neither can it be prohihibited
&amp; forbiddē frō any maner of perſon,
of what eſtate, ſort, or condition ſo euer the
ſame be of: but it ought to be cōmon vnto al
the world, as wel to men as women, yea and
y• in a vulgar or cōmon language, which all
do vnderſtande, becauſe it is ordayned &amp; appointed
for al. And likewiſe the promiſes of
God, which are therein cōtained, do apperteine
vnto al. And therefore Antichriſt &amp; his
members do exerciſe great &amp; cruell tyrānie
vpon the faithful children of God, as wel in

that they take frō thē, &amp; vtterly do forbid thē
to reade ye ſame worde, &amp; in ſtead thereof, ſet
before thē dreames, lies, Canons &amp; dānable

deadly ſinne, and eternall damnation, they
both forbid &amp; command things, that in deede
are but indifferent: which maner of theirs is
ye only note &amp; marke to know Antichriſt by.

                        I beleeue, that this holy doctrine of the
Goſpel in the very time by God appointed,

                              •
                           as confirmed and approoued by heauenly

                           iracles, as wel by Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe,
the Prophets, and Apoſtles, as alſo by other
good &amp; faithfull miniſters of the ſame Goſpell,
&amp; that after ſuch a ſort, that for y• cōfirming
thereof, there is now no more need of
newe miracles, but rather we muſt content
our ſelues with that is done, &amp; ſimply and
playnly beleeue only the holy Scriptures,
without ſeeking any further to be 
                              •
                           aught,
watching &amp; ſtill taking heede to our ſelues,
that we be not beguiled, &amp; deceiued with the
falſe miracles of Antichriſt, wherewith the
worlde at this day is ſtuffed, which miracles
are wrought by the woorking of Satan, to
confirme all kinde of idolatrie, errors, abuſes
and iniquities, and thereby to blinde the

poore and ignorant: The which thing the
Lorde God ſuffereth iuſtly to be done, becauſe
they woulde not receiue the ſpirite of
trueth, to be ſaued: yea God ſuffereth them
to receyue the ſpirite of lying, which hath
power to deceiue, to the ende they ſhould be
damned, becauſe they haue allowed lying &amp;
iniquitie, and haue refuſed righteouſneſſe
and trueth. The true miracles then are
wrought by the only power of God, for the
confirming of his doctrine, &amp; are wrought
for the infidels ſakes, and not for the faithfull.
But the preaching and true receyuing
of the holy worde of God is only giuen and
miniſtred to the faithfull, and to thoſe that
beleeue.
                     
                     
                        The Lviii. Article.
                        I beleeue alſo ye holy ſacraments, (which
are the ſeconde marke or badge of the true
Church) to be the ſignes of the reconciliatiō
&amp; great atonement made betweene God &amp;
vs, thorow Ieſus Chriſt. They are ſeales of
the Lords promiſes, &amp; are outward &amp; viſible
pledges &amp; gages of the inward faith, &amp; are
in nomber only twayne, that is to ſay, Baptiſme,
and the holy Supper of the Lorde.
The which two are not voyde and emptie
ſignes, but full, that is to ſaye, they are not

onely ſignes, whereby ſome thing is ſignified,
but alſo they are ſuch ſignes as doe exhibite,
and giue the thing that they ſignifie
in deede, as by Gods helpe we will declare
hereafter. But as touching all the other
fiue ſacraments, which with great abuſe
and ſuperſtition are receiued and vſed in
the papiſticall church, yt is to ſay, Confirmation,
confeſſion, mariage, abſolution, otherwiſe
called the ſacramēt of the prieſthood,
and extreme vnction or anneling, I ſaye,
that all theſe were eccleſiaſticall ceremonies,
the which the holie fathers in their
time vſed holily without any ſuperſtition,
euen as by their exāple ye ſame may be vſed
this day, ſo that it be done without any errour,
abuſe and ſuperſtition, and that in no
wiſe it be hurtfull to the Chriſtian libertie
of the Goſpell, the which doeth deliuer our
conſciences from all outward beggerly ceremonies
by man ordeined and deuiſed,
without the word of God.

                        I beleeue that baptiſme is the ſigne of
the newe league and friendſhip betweene
God and vs, made by Ieſus Chriſt, and it
is the marke of the Chriſtians nowe in the
time of the Goſpel, as in time paſt circumciſion

was a marke vnto the Iewes, which
were vnder the Lawe. Yea, Baptiſme is an
outward waſhing done with water, therby
ſignifying an inward waſhing of the holy
Ghoſt, wrought through ye blood of Chriſt.
The which baptiſme ought as well to bee
giuen and communicated to litle children,
as to thoſe that be great, according to Ieſus
Chriſt his ordinance, once for all, without
any rebaptiſing. This baptiſme is the
redde ſea, wherein Pharao, that is to ſaye,
the deuill, with his army of ſinnes are altogether
drowned, and the Iſraelites paſſe
thorowe it ſafely, and afterward walking
thorowe the deſert of this worlde, in great
ſorowes, vexations, and troubles, doe vſe
daily for their comfort the heauēly Manna,
which is the holy woorde of God, vntill
thorowe death they may enter into the
heauenly land of promiſe.

                        I beleeue alſo that baptiſme is ye entry
of the church, a waſhing into a newe birth,
and a renewing of the holy Ghoſt, whereby
wee doe forſake our ſelues, the deuill, the
fleſh, ſinne, and the worlde. For being once
ridde of the olde man with all his concupiſcences,
wee are clothed with the newe

man which is Ieſus Chriſt, in righteouſnes
&amp; holines, &amp; with him we dye &amp; are buried
in his death, to the ende yt with Chriſt
we may riſe from death to the glorie of the
father. And euen likewyſe being thus new
borne, wee ſhould walke in newenes of life,
alwayes mortifying in vs that which is of
vs, that thereby the body of ſinne may bee
vtterly deſtroyed, and plucked vp by the
roote.

                        I beleeue that this baptiſme ought to
be miniſtred, not with oyle, ſalte, ſpittell,
and ſuch like baggage, but onely in cleane
and fayre water, and that in the name of
the father, the ſonne, and the holy Ghoſt,
according to the inſtitution and ordinance
of God, without chaunging any thing
therein, putting any thing thereunto, or
taking any thing there fro: and the ſame
alſo to be vſed in a vulgare and common
language, that all the people may vnderſtande:
for what ſo euer is done or ſayd in
the Churche of Chriſt, ought to bee vnderſtande
and knowen of all that bee faithfull.
By this baptiſme we are changed and altered
from children of wrath, of ſinne, of the
deuill, and of deſtruction, into the children

of God, of grace and ſaluation, thereby to
be made the Lordes, heires and coheires
with Chriſt of eternall life, &amp; for that cauſe
the ſame ought to be giuen and communicated
only to reaſonable creatures, which
are apt and meete to receiue ſuch things,
and not vnto bels and ſuch like, which neither
can receiue, ne vſe the thing ſignified
by baptiſme.

is not ſo neceſſary to ſaluation, that one
may not be ſaued without it, in caſe of neceſſitie.
And likewiſe I doubt not in the
ſaluation of litle children, which die without
baptiſme, but that the ſame are ſaued in
the faith of their parentes, as wel as if they
were baptized, euen as in time paſt vnder
the Lawe, the litle children dying without
circumciſion, were ſaued in the fayth of
their parentes. But this onely do I vnderſtand
of the children of the faithfull, vnto
whom the promiſes of God do apperteine,
and not of the infidels and reprobate.

                        I beleeue that the holy ſacrament of the
ſupper, is an holy and outward ceremonie,
inſtituted by Ieſus Chriſt in the Goſpel, a

day before his death, in the nature and ſubſtance
of bread and wyne, in remembrance,
and for a memoriall of his death and paſſiō,
hauing and containing in it a promiſe of
the remiſſion of ſinnes. By this ſacrament
we are in deede made partakers of the body
and blood of Ieſus Chriſt, and be therewith
nouriſhed &amp; fedde in the houſe of the
Lorde, which is his church, after that into
the ſame, we are entred thorowe baptiſme.
The ſame ought to be giuē and miniſtred
to all vnder both the kindes, according to
the ordinance &amp; commandement of Chriſt:
for the altering whereof, none ought to be
ſo hardie as to attempt any thing.

                        I beleeue that in this holy Sacrament,
the ſignes or badges are not changed in
any point, but the ſame doe remaine wholy
in their nature, that is to ſaye, the bread is
not changed and tranſſubſtantiated (as the
fonde Papiſtes and falſe doctors do teach,
deceiuing the poore people) into the body
of Ieſus Chriſt, neither is the wyne tranſſubſtantiated
into his blood: but the bread
remaineth ſtill bread, and the wyne remaineth
ſtill wyne, euery one in his proper and
firſt nature. For the wordes that Chriſt

ſpake to his diſciples in giuing them the
bread, ſaying, This is my body, I vnderſtande
and beleeue to be ſpoken by a figuratiue
maner of ſpeach called Metonomia,
which is a maner of ſpeaking very common
in the ſcriptures, as the ſame was vnderſtand,
and alſo declared by the wrytings
of the holy fathers &amp; doctors of the church,
Ireneus, Ciprian, Tertulian, Ambroſe, Auguſtine,
Chriſoſtome, and other like, which
liued before the counſell of Lateran, where
it was concluded, that the bread was tranſubſtanciated
into the bodie of Chriſt, and
the wyne into his blood, and then was it
geuen forth for an article of our faith, to
the great diſhonour of God, &amp; to the great
ſlaunder of all the church, and it was done
in the yeere of our Lorde 1050, by Pope
Leo the ninth, in the which time the deuill
was vnbounde, as it was prophecied of in
the Apocalips, and troubled the church of
Chriſt, more then euer he did before.

                        I beleeue that all this ſacrament conſiſteth
in the vſe thereof: ſo that without
the right vſe the bread and wyne in nothing
differ from other common bread and wine,
that is commonly vſed, and therefore I do

not beleeue that the bodie of Chriſt can be
conteined, hid, or incloſed in the bread, vnder
the bread, or with the bread, neither the
blood in the wyne, vnder the wine, or with
the wyne. But I beleeue and confeſſe the
very bodie of Chriſt to be in heauen on the
right hande of the father (as before wee
haue ſayd) and that alwayes and as often,
as wee vſe this bread and wyne, according
to the ordinance and inſtitution of Chriſt,
we doe verily and in deede receiue his bodie
and bloode.

                        I beleeue that this receiuing is not done
carnally or bodily, but ſpiritually through
a true and liuely fayth, that is to ſaye, The
body and blood of Chriſte, are not giuen
to the mouth and belly for the nouriſhing
of the body, but vnto our fayth, for the
nouriſhing of the ſpirite and inward man
vnto eternall life, and for that cauſe wee
haue no neede that Chriſte ſhoulde come
from heauen to vs, but that we ſhoulde aſcende
vnto him, lifting vp our heartes
through a liuely fayth on high vnto ye right
hand of the father, where Chriſt ſitteth,

from whence we wayte for our redemptiō,
and wee muſt not ſeeke for Chriſt in theſe
bodily elementes.

and receiueth no more then hee bringeth
with him, ſauing peraduenture the increaſe
of faith, grace, and vertue: and therefore
they onely finde and receiue Ieſus
Chriſte vnto ſaluation, which through
true and liuely faith, bryng the ſame with
them: but the others finde and receiue only
the outwarde and viſible ſignes, and that
to their condemnation, as Iudas and other

and inuiſible. And I confeſſe that as
our bodie and outward man receiueth the
thing that is earthly and viſible, which is
the bread and the wyne, whereby the bodie
is nouriſhed and fedde: euen ſo verely our
ſpirit and inward man receiueth the thing
that is heauenly and ſpirituall, which is

ſignified by the breade and wine, that is to
ſay, the body and bloud of Chriſt, after ſuch
ſorte, that thereby wee are become one with
him, bone of his bones, and fleſh of his fleſh,
and made partakers with him of all righteouſnes
and other vertues, giftes and graces,
the which the eternall father hath beſtowed
on him.

haue dyed in the fayth through the worde
&amp; faith, ſawe him beforehand which was
to come, and receiued as much &amp; the ſame
thing that we receiue by the ſacraments:
For they were of the ſelfe ſame Church,
faith, &amp; lawe that we be of. They were aſwell
Chriſtians, as wee, and vſed the ſame

that all ſuch as are vnworthy, ſhould be refuſed
for feare of defyling &amp; contaminating

not but vnto the faithfull, and to thoſe of
his owne houſholde. I call thoſe vnworthy
which are infidels, idolaters, blaſphemers,
deſpiſers of God, heretikes, &amp; all other that
make ſects to deuide themſelues from the
people, thereby to breake the vnitie of the

murtherers, quarrellers, ſowers of diſcord,
whoremongers, theeues, couetous perſons,
drunkardes, gluttons, &amp; generally,
all thoſe that leade a wicked and a ſlaunderous
life. For ſuch maner of people, haue
no parte nor portion of the kingdome of
God, and for that cauſe ſuch ought to be
caſt &amp; thruſt out of the Church. For with
ſuch it is not lawfull to keepe any company,
to eate, drinke, or to haue any frendſhip,

bringing of them to repentance.

which were both lyers, and wicked: yea
it is as contrary to the holy ſupper, as the

nyght is vnto the day, and Belial to Chriſt

thē the noone day, by conferring &amp; comparyng
the inſtitution of the holy ſupper (as

Paul) vnto the celebration of the maſſe:
And therefore the Maſſe can be no remembrāce
of true ſacrifice yt is to ſay, of ye death
&amp; paſſion of Chriſt as ye holy ſupper is: But
ye Maſſe, is an vtter forſaking of the ſame,
becauſe it doeth attribute, and aſcribe to it
ſelfe, that which doeth appertayne only to
the bloud of Chriſt ſhedde vpon the Croſſe,
that is to ſay, ſatiſfaction, purgation, and
remiſſion of ſinnes, with the increaſe of
grace, and becauſe men are compelled to
do godly honour vnto ye creature, in ſtead
of the Creator, to a morſell of bread in the
ſteade of Ieſus Chriſt our only Lord, Sauiour,
and redeemer.

diſcipline, is very cōmodious &amp; profitable,
yea &amp; very neceſſary to ye catholike church,

                        I beleeue that the power to binde and
looſe, to excommunicate and to abſolue,
that is commonly called the keyes of the
Church, is giuen of God, not to one or
two, or to ſome particular perſon, but to
the whole Church, that is to ſay, to all the
faythfull and beleeuers in Chriſt, not for to
deſtroy, vndoe or caſt away, but to edifie &amp;
to aduance al: And therefore I ſay &amp; confeſſe,
that excommunication &amp; abſolution
ought not, neither can it be giuen at the
luſt and pleaſure of ſome particularly, but
by the conſent of all the Church, or at
the leaſt, by the greater or moſt ſound part
of the ſame, when they be congregated &amp;
aſſembled together in the name of Chriſt,
and the ſame to be done with prayer.
                     
                     
                        The lxxiiii. Article.
                        I beleeue that this excommunication

exerciſed and executed rightly, according
as Ieſus Chriſt hath declared and commā
                           ded
ye ſame in the Goſpel, is of ſo great authoritie,
ſtrength &amp; power, that it may ſhut
vp heauen from men in ſuch wiſe, that all
thoſe that are worthyly excommunicated,
are caſt out of the Church militant, and alſo
ſhal be caſt out of ye Church triumphāt,
which is heauē, except they repent. It is the
ſword that is ſo ſharpe to cut off the rotten
members of Chriſtes myſtical body, which
is his Church. It is the key to ſhut vp the
Heauens from the wicked. It is a rodde to
chaſten them, which neuertheleſſe is not
vſed to confound them, but as a ſpirituall
medicine to amend them, to receyue them,
to make thē whole, &amp; bring them againe to
ye ſame eſtate, frō the which they are fallen.
                     
                     
                        The .lxxv. Article.
                        I beleeue that this excommunication
which is ye laſt rodde of the Church, ought
not, neither can it be exerciſed towarde any
maner of perſon, which firſt hath not receyued
&amp; profeſſed the faith and religion of
Chriſt. And euen likewiſe the ſame can not
be pronounced for ſmal matters, as for money,
debts, &amp; ſuch like, neither ought it to
be executed towarde all ſinners, but only

againſt open rebellious and obſtinate ſinners,
when brotherly correction commanded
by Chriſt in the goſpel, doeth take no
place: And therefore al they do generally abuſe
this rodde, which doe excommunicate
the Chriſtians, for ſmall trifles, without
vſing firſt brotherly correction: And likewiſe
do they alſo that excommunicate the
Iewes, Turkes, the Heathen, and other
infidels, yea and bruite beaſtes, meaning
thereby to thruſt &amp; caſt out of the chriſtian
church, thoſe that neuer were in it.

                        I beleeue herewith, that the vnity of the
ſpirit, peace, concord, and charytie, that is
to ſay, true amytie, and brotherly loue, the
ſweet &amp; friendly helping &amp; ſupporting one
of an other, is alſo one of ye works &amp; ſignes
of ye true catholique Church, &amp; of the faithful
children of God, by the which they are
knowen to be of the ſchoole and of the
number of Ieſus Chriſt his diſciples. And
wee muſt not glory in our ſelues, in the
title of chriſtianitie, or of the faith, ſaying,
I beleeue, I beleeue, if wee haue not this
charitie, peace, loue, and true vnity of heart
together, agreeing one with another in all

good workes. For the true faith neuer goeth
without theſe things: by the which alſo
it declareth, and many feſteth it ſelf to all.
Theſe are the ſignes and markes of the
true chriſtian Church, vnto the which
it is linked and bound, and not vnto any
certayne place, time or perſonages. And
there is the Church perfect, where theſe
markes are found and vſed, and on the other
part, if any one of the ſame be lacking,
then is not the ſame perfect. And albeit
that this whole perfection, for the eſtate of
this preſent world, cannot be founde in the
Church militant, neuertheleſſe, the fault
thereof muſt be acknowledged before the
Lord, and the remedy and ordering thereof
be committed to him.

                        I beleeue, and receyue in this Church
two ſwords, that is to ſay, two powers, the
one is eccleſiaſticall, and ſpirituall, the
which lyeth and conſiſteth in the only adminiſtration
of the woorde, and of the
Sacraments, the which beareth neither
rodde nor ſtaffe, other then the tongue,
neither doeth vſe any other knyfe then
the ſworde of the ſpirite, which is the

word of God. Likewiſe I confeſſe that all
thoſe that haue this ſword in their handes,
ought to be without blame, aſwell in their
lyuing as in their doctrine, otherwiſe, they
ought to be depoſed, &amp; others to be placed
in their roumes &amp; to put &amp; ordayne others
that are better in their places. The other
power is temporall, that is to ſay, the magiſtrate,
which hath authority ouer externe
and ciuill thinges, to render according to
right to euery man, that which of right to
him appertayneth.
                     
                     
                        The lxxviii. Article.
                        I beleeue that the magiſtrate is an ordinance
of God ſet in his church, for the defence
of the good &amp; godly, and to chaſten
&amp; puniſh the wicked: And alſo to the magiſtrate
muſt be giuen tribute, honour, &amp; reuerence
&amp; obedience in all thinges, that be
not in any wiſe contrary to Gods worde.
And I doe vnderſtand this, not only of the
faithful Magiſtrate, but alſo of the infidell
&amp; wicked Tyrant, vnto whome wee muſt
obey as vnto the Lorde in all thinges, ſo
that he command nothing contrary to the
word of God: For then wee ought rather
to obey God then man, after the example
of the Apoſ
                              •
                           les Peter and Iohn.
                     
                     
                        
                        The Lxxix. Article.
                        I beleeue that to the magiſtrate it doeth
appertaine, not onely to haue regarde vnto
the common wealth, but alſo vnto eccleſiaſticall
matters, to take away and to ouerthrowe
all idolatrie &amp; falſe ſeruing of God,
to deſtroy the kingdome of Antichriſt and
all falſe doctrine, to promote the glorie of
God, &amp; to aduance the kingdome of Chriſt,
to cauſe the word of ye Goſpel euery where
to be preached, and the ſame to maintayne
vnto death, to chaſten alſo, and to puniſh the
falſe prophets which lead the poore people
after idoles and ſtrange gods, and in ſteade
of the Goſpell preache and teach the fables
and traditions of men, to the diſhonour of
God and Chriſt his Sonne, and to the
great decay of the whole Church. To ſuch
a magiſtrate euery perſon, of what eſtate,
degree or condition ſo euer hee bee, ought
to be ſubiect, and him in all honeſt and reaſonable
things to obey, becauſe he repreſenteth
ye perſon of a great Lord, before whom
euery knee ought to bowe. And the ſame
muſt not be forgotten in our prayers, to the
ende that the Lord may vouchſafe to guide
and direct all his wayes, &amp; that vnder him
we may liue in godly peace &amp; tranquillitie.
                     
                     
                        
                        The Lxxx. Article.
                        I beleeue that the magiſtrate, as alſo the
vſe of othes and ſuch like, is the ordinance
of the Lord, for to leade the imperfection of
man in his corrupt nature after his fall:
The which the faythfull, after that hee hath
aſſaied all other meanes, may holily &amp; iuſtly
vſe in matters of controuerſie which may
chance betweene him and his neighbour, to
ſet an order, and to make peace in al things.
And therefore hee that in neceſſitie will not
vſe this way, ought rather to be iudged an
Anabaptiſt then a Chriſtian.
                     
                     
                        The Lxxxi. Article.
                        I beleeue that the Magiſtrate holily may
miniſter an othe vnto the faithfull in iudgement
for the knowledge of the trueth, and
to make an ende of all controuerſies &amp; matters
in variance betweene man and man:
the which othe ought to bee taken in the
onely name of the liuing God, becauſe it
is the thirde commandement of the firſt table.
And albeit the perfection required to
be in a Chriſtian, ought ſimply to vſe yea
yea, and nay nay, without any ſwearing,
neuertheleſſe the faithfull may holily vſe an
othe in place &amp; time with diſcretion, &amp; in the
feare of the Lord, for things honeſt, iuſt and

true, for the verifying of the trueth, when
the honour of God or the ſauing of a mans
neyghbour dependeth vpon it, or elſe not.
For the man that accuſtometh to ſweare,
ſhall be filled with iniquitie, and his houſe
ſhall not bee without the plague. And I
confeſſe alſo that as euery othe, vowe, and
promiſe made according to Gods worde, be
it to God or to men, doeth binde and ought
to be kept and obſerued without breaking:
euen ſo thoſe that are made without and
contrary to Goos worde and commandement,
as are the religious vowes and ſuch
like, which promiſe things impoſſible and
contrary to the word of God, doe not binde
a man in any wiſe, but with a good conſcience
may bee violated and broken. For in
wicked promiſes, &amp; in fooliſh and vndiſcrete
vowes, the faithfull, wiſe and ſage may
change their purpoſe.
                     
                     
                        The Lxxxii. Article.
                        I beleeue and confeſſe that marriage is
an honorable eſtate amongſt all men, and
the bedde vndefiled is holy and ought not to
be broken. It is inſtituted and ordayned of
God, for the bringing forth of children, and
to eſchew fornication, from the which eſtate
of marriage none ought, nor can be reſtrayned,

if there be no iuſt and lawfull let by the
word of God, but the ſame ought to be free
to euery bodie, of what eſtate, ſort or condition
ſoeuer the ſame bee of: for it is much
better to marrie then to burne: And for that
cauſe, all what ſoeuer they be, men or women,
which haue not the gift to liue vnmarried,
ought to marry, to the intent the
Temple of the holy Ghoſt, that is to ſay,
our bodies may not bee polluted and defiled.
                     
                     
                        The Lxxxiii. Article.
                        I beleeue alſo that the forbidding of marriage
for certaine perſons, likewiſe the forbidding
of certaine meates, the difference
of dayes, garmentes, and ſuch like, is the
deuiliſh doctrine of Antichriſt, and wholie
againſt the Chriſtian libertie of the Goſpell
taught by Ieſus Chriſt, the which
deliuereth vs from all outwarde ceremonies
of the lawe, and ſetteth vs at libertie
to vſe all things with giuing GOD
thankes: So that it bee not done to the
hurt of our neyghbour: For all thinges
are made holy by the worde of God and
prayer, to him that knoweth and receyueth
the trueth. Therefore to compell the Chriſtians
to theſe things, is but to take from

them and to robbe them of their Chriſtian
libertie, and by tyrannie to ſet them vnder
the curſe of the lawe, from the which Chriſt
by his death &amp; paſſion hath deliuered them,
and it is one true marke and note to knowe
Antichriſt by.
                     
                     
                        The Lxxxiiii. Article.
                        I beleeue that the pure and true ſeruice
of God doeth not conſiſt in theſe ceremonies
&amp; outward things, neither in babbling
much and mumbling of long prayers, neyther
in crying and braying in the Church
like Aſſes or the Prieſts of Baal, but in ſpirituall
things, as liuely and true faith in
God and his worde taught by Ieſus Chriſt
his onely Sonne, which is of power, and
worketh through charity toward our neighbour,
true and perfect calling vpon Gods
name, with due obedience to his commandementes
in humblenes of ſpirit, according
to his worde: For as God is a Spirit, ſo
will he be worſhipped and ſerued in ſpirite
and trueth.
                     
                     
                        The Lxxxv. Article.
                        I beleeue that all Gods ſeruices without
Gods worde, and contrary to his commandement,
is idolatrie and iniquitie. I cal
idolatrie, after the faſhion of the Prophets,

not onely that which is done vnto the honor
of an Idole or ſtrange gods, but alſo that
which is done to y• honouring of the liuing
God, contrary to his word and commandement:
And therefore they are not only Idolaters
which worſhip and ſerue Idoles and
ſtrange Gods, as the Ethnicks &amp; ſuch like,
but alſo all thoſe which worſhip and ſerue
the true God of heauen, after their owne
fantaſie, or after the traditions of men without
faith, without the word of God, &amp; otherwiſe
thē God hath commaunded them: And
they only are Chriſtians, which do confeſſe
and ſerue one onely God which is in heauen,
according to his word and commandement,
all whoſe woorkes, aſwell outwarde
as inwarde, corporall as ſpirituall, bee the
true ſeruice of the Lorde, becauſe the ſame
are done in the fayth of the Sonne of God,
and according to the calling of the Lord, after
the which euery faythfull bodie ought to
walke.
                     
                     
                        The Lxxxvi. Article.
                        I beleeue and confeſſe that it is not lawfull
for a Chriſtian to be preſent eyther in
ſpirite, eyther in bodie at the idolatrous ſacrifices,
neither to enter into their temples
while they are in doing of their idolatries

and ſacrifices, if it be not of purpoſe to rebuke
and vtter their impietie, and to teache
the trueth as the holy Prophetes and Apoſtles
did, and not to diſſemble as the hypocrites
doe. For if the bodie be the creature
of God, (as it is in deede) aſwell as the
ſoule, and be the Temple of the holy Ghoſt,
and a member of the myſticall bodie of
Chriſt, and if it ſhall one day riſe and poſſeſſe
eternall life with the ſoule, it muſt
then followe of neceſſitie, that it ought to
be wholly dedicated vnto the ryght ſeruice
of God in this worlde together with the
ſoule and the ſpirite, or elſe they can not at
the generall reſurrection be coupled together,
but muſt be ſeparated aſunder, the one
to be with God in heauen, whome it loued,
and the other to be in hell, with the deuill,
whom it ſerued: the which thing is impoſſible,
&amp; for that cauſe I ſay, that al ſuch diſſimulatiō
is a plaine forſaking of Chriſt and
of his Goſpel. Likewiſe I beleeue and confeſſe,
that all maner of ſuch diſſemblings by
the which the trueth of the Goſpel is hid,
the word of the Lord deſpiſed, infidelitie and
ignorance confirmed, and the weake are offended,
the ſame can not be of God, but of
the deuill, and altogether againſt the trueth

of Gods worde. And therefore there muſt
be no halting on both ſides: but wee muſt
goe and walke foorthryght and ſtrayghtly
before this great Lorde, which ſeeth, beholdeth,
and knoweth all things, yea, euen before
they are begonne.
                     
                     
                        The Lxxxvii. Article.
                        I beleeue alſo that the beginning of all
Idolatrie was the fynding out and inuention
of Images, which alſo were made
to the great offence of the ſoules of men,
and are as ſnares and trappes for the feete
of the ignorant to make them to fal. Therefore
they ought not to be honoured, ſerued,
worſhipped, neyther to bee ſuffered in the
Temples or Churches, neyther in any
other places, where Chriſtian people doe
meete together, to heare and vnderſtande
the word of God, but rather the ſame ought
vtterly to bee taken awaye and throwen
downe, according to the effect of the ſecond
commandement of God, and that ought to
bee done by the common authoritie of the
Magiſtrate, and not by the priuate authoritie
of any particular man. For the wood
of the gallowes whereby iuſtice is done, is
bleſſed of GOD, but the Image made
by mans hande is accurſed of the Lorde,

and ſo is he that made it. And therefore
wee ought to beware of Images aboue
all thinges.
                        This is that I beleeue of the Catholike
faith, and of the thinges that concerne the
ſame, and is for the fourth point of my faith,
Nowe reſteth to ſpeake of the fruites that
proceed out of the ſame, and what I receiue
by the ſame faith: which fruites are in number
three, whereof the firſt is,
                     
                  
                  
                     The forgiueneſſe of ſinnes.
                     
                        The Lxxxviii. Article.
                        I beleeue that al thoſe that are come, and
ſhall come of the race and lyne of Adam,
generally are conceiued &amp; borne in iniquitie
and corruption, (except Ieſus Chriſt only)
and that they are all ſinners, tranſgreſſers
and breakers of the law and wil of the Lord,
and according to their nature they are corrupt,
the children of wrath, worthy of Gods
iudgement, of condemnatiō &amp; eternal death,
all needing the grace and mercie of God
and of Chriſtes blood ſhedding. For God
hath wrapped all vnder ſinne, to the intent
hee woulde haue mercie vpon all through
Ieſus Chriſt our Lorde.

                        I beleeue that the knowledge of ſinne
proceedeth of the lawe, but the remiſſion and
forgiueneſſe of ſinne commeth of the Goſpel,
and is giuen vs by the onely grace and
mercie of God in the blood of Ieſus Chriſt,
through the faith wee haue therein, whereby
wee are counted righteous before God, not
through our good woorkes or deſeruings,
neither by the merites of any other creature
either in heauen or in earth. For I knowe
not neither do I alow any other merites but
ye merites of my good Lord, maſter and onely
ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt, who hath merited
and ſufficiently ſatiſfied for vs, &amp; hath paide
for his owne their dette in wiping out the
hande writing and obligation which was againſt
vs, and in taking the ſame from vs,
hath faſtened it vnto the Croſſe.
                     
                     
                        The xc. Article.
                        I beleeue that this iuſtifiyng faith is a
meere and ſingular gift of God, the which
is commonly giuen by the hearing of Gods
woorde, whereupon onely it is builte,
and not vpon the doctrines and traditions
of men. I call a iuſtifiyng faith, a
certaine aſſurance and earneſt perſwaſion of

the good will, loue, grace, bounteouſneſſe
and mercy of God towarde vs, whereby we
are aſſured &amp; verily perſwaded in our hearts
of the mercy, fauour and good will of God
the father, that he is on our ſide, and for vs, againſt
all that are againſt vs, and that he wil
be a mercifull father vnto vs, pardoning our
ſinnes, and will giue vs his grace, make vs
his children by adoption, and admitte vs for
heires vnto eternal life, and all this freely in
his ſonne, &amp; by his only ſonne Ieſus Chriſt
our Lorde, and not for our merites or good
workes. This faith can doe all thinges, and
to it nothing is impoſſible: the which faith
is neuer perfect nor great ynough in vs, and
therefore ought wee alwayes to praye with
y• Apoſtles, ſaying, Lorde increaſe our faith,
helpe our vnbeliefe: For that faith only doth
comfort vs, maketh vs holy, maketh vs righteous
and acceptable before the Lorde, it declareth
vs to be the children of GOD and
heires of eternall life: the which faith alſo
is the mother, the ſpring and roote of all
good workes, like as infidelitie is the fountaine
and roote of all wickednes.
                     
                     
                        The xci. Article.
                        I beleeue alſo that good workes are not

ſuperfluous, vayne and vnprofitable, but
neceſſarie to ſaluation. I call good workes,
not thoſe which are done after the fantaſie
or commaundement of men, but onely thoſe
that God by his woorde hath commaunded
to bee done, the which ought to be done not
to deſerue or merite any thing thereby at
Gods hande, or by the ſame to eſcape eternall
condemnation, but onely becauſe God
hath commanded them, and that they might
teſtifie the loue that we haue vnto our Lord,
and our obedience to his holy woorde and
commaundement, and to the intent that in
vs and by vs hee might be glorified, and that
our neighbours, aſwell the infidels &amp; vnbeeleeuers,
as the faithful, might therby be edified:
and in like maner to ſhewe and to manifeſt
the faith that we haue in God and in his
worde, as the good tree ſheweth it ſelfe and
is knowne by his fruite, yea &amp; to make ſure
and certaine vnto vs our calling, election &amp;
predeſtination. To theſe endes ſerue all the
good works commaunded by God, and who
ſoeuer doeth them to any other ende, doeth
miſuſe them, ſinneth and doth iniurie to the
blood of Chriſt, and diſhonoureth God and
his word, for in ſo doing, he declareth Chriſt
died in vayne.

                        I beleeue that there is none, either in this
worlde or in the other worlde, eyther in heauen
or in earth, which can forgiue mee and
pardon my ſinnes, but onely God, which
hath giuen power and authoritie to the miniſters
of his worde, to declare to all faithfull
beleeuers which are of a contrite heart
and be truely penitent, that all their ſinnes
through the free mercy of God are forgiuen
them through the blood of Ieſus Chriſte,
which was ſhedde for them: yea to declare
vnto them that they are pardoned of their
ſinnes, and that the ſame is done by the miniſtery
of ye worde of the holy Church, in the
which this remiſſion is exhibited and giuen,
and not otherwiſe: But on our part is required
perfecte repentance, the which hath
two partes. The firſt is contrition, that is to
ſay, the knowledging, hating, and abhorring
of ſinne: the which thing is adminiſtred
by the Lawe, and bringeth vs to deſpaire,
if with the contrarie we be not holpen
with a lyuely fayth, and the mercie of
GOD the Father thorowe the blood of
Ieſus Chriſt, which proceedeth out of the
Goſpel. This fayth comforteth vs, maketh
vs ſtedfaſt, and cauſeth vs to fynde

fauour before the iudgement ſeate of God.

                        I beleeue that ſinne dwelleth ſtil in man,
yea in the very ſaintes and children of God
after their newe birth through Baptiſme
and the holie Ghoſt, the which ſinne neuertheleſſe
ſhall not be laied to their charge becauſe
of ye faith they haue in Ieſus Chriſt: for
as al the ſinnes of the infidels and reprobate
bee damnable and ſhall not bee pardoned,
becauſe of their infidelitie, euen ſo all
the ſinnes of the faithfull and choſen bee veniall
ſinnes and forgiueable becauſe of their
faith: And therefore I beleeue, that there is
one onely ſinne that is mortall and irremiſſible,
which is vnbeliefe or infidelitie, that is
to ſay, not to beleeue in the ſonne of GOD.
For where true faith in Chriſt is founde,
there all ſinnes are hid, couered and pardoned.

is the ſecond fruite of my faith.

                        I beleeue that there ſhall bee one reſurrection,
which ſhall bee generall to all the

worlde, aſwell of the good as of the badde,
which ſhall bee in the ende of the worlde by
the power of Chriſt, and through the miniſterie
of the angels, the which with a great
voice of a trumpette ſhal cal together all the
worlde before the Lorde, and ſhall gather together
the electe and choſen from the foure
windes, euen from the higheſt of the heauens
vnto the endes of the earth, and deuide
the euill from the good, and the wicked ſhall
they caſt into the fierie fornace, where is
weeping and gnaſhing of teeth: and then
ſhall the righteous ſhine as the ſunne in the
kingdome of their father, and ſhall bee together,
and bee companions with the Angels
of God. This is the ſeconde reſurrection,
and bleſſed is hee that ſhall haue part of portion
therein, for the ſame ſhall not be touched
with the ſeconde death.

                        I beleeue yt this reſurrectiō ſhal be of ye fleſh
&amp; not of the ſpirit, yt is to ſay, that ye ſpirit
or ſoule of mā ſhal not riſe, becauſe it is immortal
&amp; dieth not. But ye body, which before,
aſwel by ye reaſō of nature, as alſo becauſe of
ſinne was ſubiect vnto death and corruption,

to rotte, and to be brought to aſhes, ſhall be
rayſed vp, and ſhalbe coupled with his owne
proper ſoule and ſpirite, and ſhall bee ſet in a
more perfect eſtate, then that wherein the
firſt man was before hee ſinned, and ſhall be
clearely exempted from al maner of corruption
of ſinne, and ſo conſequently from all
maner of imperfections, and ſhall bee faſhioned
like vnto the glorious bodie of Chriſt.

                        I beleeue that I ſhall riſe, not in any other
mans fleſh and body, but in myne owne
that I brought out of my mothers wombe,
euen with the ſelf ſame body and bones that
I haue at this preſent, but the ſame altered
and chaunged, made of mortall immortall,
of corruptible incorruptible, of vile and contemptible,
glorious: And therefore I doe
waite for the comming of my ſauiour Ieſus
Chriſt, the which through his power will
change my vile body, which was but a caſtaway,
to make it like vnto his owne glorious
bodie, according to the power whereby
he is able to ſubiect all things to him ſelfe.

and laſt fruite of my faith.
                     
                        The xcvii. Article.
                        I beleeue, that I ſhal riſe (as I haue ſaid)
with all the faithful and elect, not to die any
more, as did they that miraculouſly were
rayſed vp from death, as well by Chriſt, the
Prophets, the Apoſtles, and ſuch other, but
vnto a life that is immortall, euerlaſting, &amp;
ſhall endure for euer, to raygne eternally
with God both in body &amp; ſoule. And thereof
I am ſure, and doubt nothing at all, knowing
that whoſoeuer doubteth of his ſaluation
by Chriſt, the ſame ſhall not bee ſaued.
Wherefore as I am ſure and certaine, that
Chriſt is dead, and riſen againe for me, and
therein do not doubt: euen ſo am I ſure and
certaine of my ſaluation wrought by him,
and that without fayle I ſhall be ſaued, and
by him ſhall enter into eternall life.

                        I beleeue, that then I ſhal ſee him face to
face, whome now I ſee as thorow the glaſſe
of faith, and then ſhall knowe him perfitly,
whome now I know but in part, who after
that he hath deſtroyed and confounded al his
aduerſaries, and hath made them his footeſtoole,

ſhall make all thinges newe, for the
glory of thoſe that are his. Thē ſhal he be an
whole God in all, and ouer al things. Then
ſhal none teach his brother, ſaying, Knowe
the Lord, for then all ſhall knowe him, from
the greateſt, vnto the leaſt.

                        I beleeue alſo, that as the ſpirites of the
infidels, wicked, and reprobate, after they
are departed from their bodies, incontinently
do goe to hell vnto euerlaſting fire, their
bodies neuertheleſſe abiding in the earth,
corrupting and rotting: euen ſo likewiſe
the ſoules and ſpirites of the faithfull and
choſen children of God, incontinently after
they doe depart from their bodies, without
any tarying, are on high in heauen, to be in
glory with the Lord, and there do ſtil wayte
with an earneſt deſire for the comming and
whole redemption of their bodies, the which
they haue left rotting and corrupting in the
earth, the which thing they ſhall obtayne at
the laſt daye, and not before. Wherefore I
refuſe the fonde opinion of the Sleepers,
which affirme, that the ſpirits of the ſaintes
are not yet in heauen, but do ſleepe in a certaine
place vnknowen to vs, vntill they ſhal
receiue their bodies at the laſt day. At which

day, the myſticall body of Chriſt wholly,
perfectly, and fully muſt enter into eternall
glory.

                        I beleeue for a concluſion, that as the
Saintes and the bleſſed, when the iudgement
is ended, ſhall goe with Chriſt triumphantly
through the aire, in body and ſoule,
to dwell euerlaſtingly in glory with him &amp;
his Angels: euen ſo the wretched, wicked,
and miſerable damned, ſhal go to hell in bodie
and ſoule, with the deuil and his angels
eternally, to dwel and to be tormented with
him in the fire of hell, which neuer ſhall be
quenched, whereas ſhall be continuall weeping,
wayling, and gnaſhing of teeth, ſtung
to the quicke with the worme, that neuer
ſhall dye. From the which the Lorde
God of his great mercie and
grace vouchſafe to preſerue
and keepe vs.
Amen.
