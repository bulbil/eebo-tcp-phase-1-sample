            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            DEDICATED IN PRIVATE TO HIS MAIESTIE.

            A BRIEFE DIScourse, touching the happy vnion of the Kingdomes of England, and Scotland. DEDICATED IN PRIuate to his MAIESTIE.
            
               I DOE not finde it straunge (excellent King,) that when Heraclitus, hee that was surnamed the obscure, had set foorth a certaine booke, which is not now extant: many men tooke it for a discourse

of Nature, and many others tooke it for a Treatise of Policie, and matter of estate. For, there is a great affinitie and consent, betweene the rules of Nature, and the true rules of Policie: The one being nothing els but an order in the gouernement of the world, and the other an order, in the gouernment of an estate. And therefore, the education and erudition of the Kings of Persia, was in a science, which was termed by a name, then of great reuerence, but now degenerate and taken in ill part. For, the Persian Magicke, which was the secret literature of their Kings, was an obseruation of the contemplation of Nature, and an application thereof to a sense politicke 
                  〈◊〉
                taking the fundamentall

lawes of Nature, with the branches and passages of them, as an originall, and first modell, whence to take and describe a copie and imitation for gouernement.
            After this manner, the foresaid Instructors fet before their Kings, the examples of the celestiall bodies, the Sunne, the Moone, and the rest, which haue great glorie and veneration, but no rest or intermission, beeing in a perpetuall office of motion, for the cherishing, in turne, and in course, of inferiour bodyes. Expressing likewise, the true manner of the motions of gouernement, which though they ought to bee swifte and rapide in respect of occasion and dispatche,

yet are they to be constant and regular, without wauering or confusion.
            So did they represent vnto them, how that the Heauens do not inritch themselues by the Earth, and the Seas, nor keepe no dead stocke or vntouched treasure, of that they drawe to them from belowe, but whatsoeuer moysture they doe leuie and take from both the elements in vapours, they doe spend and turne backe againe in showers, onely houlding and storing them vp for a time, to the end to issue and distribute them in season.
            But chiefely they did expresse and expound vnto them, that fundamentall lawe of Nature, whereby all things doe subsist and are

preserued: which is, that euery thing in nature, although it hath his priuate and particular affection and appetite, and doth follow and pursue the same in small moments, and when it is deliuered and freed from more generall and common respects: yet neuerthelesse, when there is question or cause, for the sustaining of the more generall, they forsake their owne particularities and proprieties, and attend and conspire to vphold the publike.
            So, we see the Yron in small quantitie will ascend and approach to the Load-stone, vpon a particular Sympathie. But, if it bee any quantitie of moment, it leaues his appetite of amity with the Load-stone, and like a good Patriott, falleth

to the earth, which is the place and region, of massy bodies.
            So againe, the water, and other like bodies, doe fall towardes the center of the earth: which is, as was saide, their region or Country. And yet, we see nothing more vsuall, in all water-workes and Ingens, then that the water (rather then to suffer any distraction, or disunion in Nature,) will ascend: forsaking the loue to his owne region or Country, and applying it selfe to the body next adioyning.
            But, it were too large a digression, to proceede to more examples of this kinde. Your Maiesty your selfe, did fall vppon a passage of this Nature, in your gratious speech of thankes vnto

your Councell. When acknowledging Princely, their vigilancye and well deseruinges, it pleased you to note, that it was a successe and euent aboue the course of Nature, to haue so great a change, with so great a quiet: forasmuch as suddayne and great mutations, as well in state as in Nature, are rarely without violence and perturbation. So as still I conclude, there is, as was saide, a congruity betweene the principles of Nature, and and of Pollicie. And, least that Instance may seeme to appone to this assertion, I may, euen in that perticular, with your Maiesties fauour, offer vnto you a Type or Patern in Nature much resembling this present euēt in your state:

namely earthquakes, which many of them, bring euer much terror and wonder, but no actuall hurt; the earth trembling for a moment, and sodainely stablishing in perfect quiet, as it was before.
            This knowledge then, of making the gouernment of the world, a mirror for the gouernement of a state, beeing a wisedome almost lost (whereof the reason I take to be, because of the difficulty, for one man to imbrace both Philosophies;) I haue thought good to make some proofe, (as farre as my weakenesse, and the straights of time will suffer,) to reuiue in the handling of one particular wherewith now I most humbly present your Maiesty. For, surely, as hath beene said, it is a forme of

discourse, anciently vsed towardes Kings. And, to what King, should it be more proper then to a King, that is studious to conioyne contemplatiue virtue and actiue virtue together.
            Your Maiesty is the first King, which hath had the honour, to be Lapis angularis, to vnite these two mighty and warlike nations of England and Scotland, vnder one Soueraignety and Monarchy. It dooth not appeare by the recordes and memories, of any true history, nor scarcly by the fiction and pleasure of any fabulous narration, or tradition: that euer, of any antiquity, this Iland of great Brittaine was vnited vnder one King, before this day. And yet, there be no Mountaines or races

of hils, there be no seas, or great riuers, there is no diuersity of toung or language, that hath inuited or prouoked this ancient separation, or diuorce.
            The lot of Spaine was, to haue the seuerall Kingdomes of that continent (Portugal onely except,) to be vnited in an age, not long past: and, now in our age, that of Portugal also, which was the last that held out, to bee incorporate with the rest. The lot of France hath beene, much about the same time likewise, to haue reannexed vnto that crowne, the seuerall Duchies and portions, that were in former times dismembred. The lotte of this Iland, is the last reserued for your Maiesties happye times, by the

speciall prouidence and fauour of God: who hath brought your Maiesty to this happy coniunction, with great consent of harts, and in the strength of your yeares, and in the maturity of your experience. It resteth therefore, but that, (as I promised) I set before your Maiesties Princelye consideration, the grounds of Nature, touching the Vnion and commixture of bodies; &amp; the correspondence which they haue with the groundes of Pollicie, in the coniunction of states and kingdomes.
            First therefore that Position, vis vnita fortior, beeing one of the common notions of the minde, needeth not much to be induced or illustrate. We see the Sunne (when he enters, &amp; while he continues

vnder the signe of Leo) causeth more vehement heates, then when he is in Cancer: what time his beames are neuerthelesse, more perpendicular. The reason whereof, in great part, hath beene truely ascribed, to the coniunction and Corradiation in that place of heauen, of the Sunne, with the foure Starres of the first magnitude, Syrius, Canicula, Cor Leonis, &amp; Cauda Leonis.
            
            So, the Moone likewise, by ancient tradition, while she is in the same signe of Leo, is saide to be at the heart, or, to respect the hart. Which is not for any affinity, which that place in heauen can haue, with that part of mans body: But onely, because the Moone is then (by reason of the coniunction

and neerenesse with the starres aforenamed) in greatest strength of influence: and so worketh vppon that part, in inferiour bodyes, which is most vitall and principall.
            So, wee see waters and liquors, in small quantity, do easily purrifie and corrupt: but, in large quantity, subsist long, by reason of the strength, they receiue, by Vnion.
            So, in Earthquakes, the more generall doe little hurt, by reason of the vnited weight, that they offer to subuert: but, narrow and particular Earthquakes, haue many times ouerturned whole townes and Citties.
            
               So then, this point touching the force of Vnion is euident. And therefore it is more fitte to speake of the manner of Vnion. Wherein againe, it will not be pertinent, to handle one kinde of Vnion, which is Vnion, by victory: when one body, doth meerely subdue another, and conuerteth the same into his owne Nature, extinguishing and expulsing, what part so euer of it, it cannot ouercome. As, when the fire conuerteth the Wood into fire, purging awaye the Smoake and the Ashes, as vnapt matter to inflame. Or, when the bodye of a liuing creature dooth conuert

and assimilate foode and nourishment: purging and expelling whatsoeuer it cannot conuerte. For, these representations doe aunswere in matter of Pollicie, to Vnion of Countreyes by conquest: where the conquering State dooth extinguish, extirpate and expulse any parte of the estate conquered, which it findeth so contrarye, as it cannot alter and conuerte it. And therefore leauing violent Vnions: wee will consider onelye of naturall Vnions.
            The difference is excellent, which the best obseruers in Nature doe take,

betweene Compositio and Miltio; putting together and mingling. The one beeing but a coniunction of bodyes in place, the other in quality, and consent: the one, the mother of sedition and alteration, the other of peace and continuance: The one rather a confusion, then an Vnion, the other properly a Vnion. Therefore we see those bodies which they call Imperfectè miltio, last not, but are speedily dissolued. For, take for example, Snow or froth, which are Compositions of ayre and water: in them you may behold, how easily they seuer and dissolue, the water closing

togeather, and excluding the ayre.
            So, those three bodies, which the Alchymists doe so much celebrate, as the three principles of things, that is to say, Earth, Water and Oyle, (which it pleaseth them to terme Salt, Mercury and Sulphur:) wee see, if they bee vnited onely by composition, or putting togeather, how weakely and rudely they doe incorporate. For, water and earth, make but an vnperfect slime, and, if they be forced togeather by agitation, yet, vpon a little setling, the earth resides in the bottome. So, water and Oyle, though by agitation it be beaten

into an Oyntment. Yet, after a little setling, the Oyle will floate vppon the toppe.
            So as, such vnperfect minglinges, continue no longer, then they are forced: and still in the ende, the worthiest getteth aboue.
            But, otherwise it is, of perfect mixture. For, wee see those three bodies, of Earth, Water and Oyle; when they are ioyned in a regetable or Minerall, they are so vnited, as without great subtiltie of Arte, and force of extraction, they cannot

bee seperated and reduced into the same simple bodyes againe. So as, the difference betweene Compositio and Mistio, cleerelye set downe is this:
            That Compositio, is the ioyning or putting togeather of bodyes, without a new Forme: and Mistio, is the ioyning or putting togeather of bodies, vnder a new Forme.
            For, the new Forme, is Commune Vinculum: and without that, the oulde Formes, will be at striefe and discorde.
            
               Now, to reflect this light of Nature, vpon matter of estate: there hath beene put in practise in gouernment, these two seuerall kindes of pollicie, in vniting &amp; conioyning of states &amp; kingdomes. The one to retaine the auncient formes still seuered, and onely conioyned in Soueraingtie; the other, to superinduce a new forme agreeable and conuenient to the entire estate. The former of these hath beene more vsuall, and is more easie: but the latter, is more happy. For, if a man doe attentiuely reuolue histories of all nations, and iudge truly therevpon: hee will make this conclusion, that there were neuer

any State that were good commixtures, but the Romaines: which because it was the best state in the worlde, and is the best example of this pointe, wee will chiefely insist therevpon.
            In the Antiquities of Rome, Virgill brings in Iupiter, by way of Oracle or perdiction, speaking of the mixture of the Troyans and the Italians:

                  Sermonem ausonij patrium, moresque tenebunt.
                  Vtque est, nomen erit: comisti corpore tantum
                  Subsident Teucri, morem, ritusque sacrorum
                  Adijciam, faciamque omnes vno ore Latinos.
                  
                     Hine genus Ausomo mistum quod sanguine surget,
                  Suprà homines, suprà ire deos pietate videbis
               
Wherein Iupiter maketh a kinde of partition or distribution, that Italy should giue the language and the lawes; Troye should giue a mixture of men, and some religious rites, and both people should meete in one name of Latines.
            
            Soone after the foundation of the Citie of Rome, the people of the Romaines and the Sabines mingled vppon equall termes. Wherin the interchange went so euen, that (as Liui noteth) the one nation gaue the name to the place, and the other

to the people. For, Rome continued the name: but, the people were called Quirites, which was the Sabine worde deriued of Cures, the countrie of Tacitus.
            
            But, that which is chiefly to be noted, in the whole continuance of the Romaine gouernment, they were so liberall of their naturallizations, as in effect, they made perpetuall mixtures. For their manner was, to graunt the same, not onely to particular persons, but to Families and linages: and not onely so, but to whole Citties and Countries. So as, in the end it came to passe, that Rome was Communis patria, as some

of the Ciuilians call it.
            So, we read, that Saint Paul, after he had beene beaten with Roddes, and therevpon charged the Officer with violation of the priuiledge of a Citizen of Rome: the Captaine then sayde to him; Art thou then a Romaine? That priuiledge hath cost mee deere! To whome Saint Paul replyed: But I was so borne. And yet, in another place Saint Paul professeth of himselfe that hee was a Iewe by tribe. So as it is manifest that some of his Ancestors were naturallized, to him and to his descendents.
            So, wee read, that it was one of the first despights that was

done to Iulius Caesar, that whereas hee had obtayned Naturalization for a Cittye in Gaul, one of the Cittizens of that Cittye, was beaten with roddes, by the commaundement of the Consul Marcellus.
            
            So wee read in Cornelius Tacitus, that, in the Emperour Claudius time, the nation of Gaul, that part which was called Comata, the wilder part, were suters to bee made capable of the Honours of beeing Senators and Officers of Rome. His wordes are: Cùm de supplendo, Senatu agitaretur, Primoresque Galliae quae Commata appellatur, foedera et Ciuitatem Romanam

pridem assecuti, ius adipiscendorum in vrbe honorum expeterent: multus ea super re, variusque rumor, et studijs diuersis apud Principem certabatur: and, in the ende, after long debate, it was ruled, they should be admitted.
            So likewise, the authoritie of Nicholas Machiauell, seemeth not to bee contemned: who, inquiring of the causes of the growth of the Romaine Empire, dooth giue iudgement, there was not one greater then this, that the state did so easily compound, and incorporate with straungers.
            It is most true, that most

Estates and Kingdomes, haue taken the other course: of which this effect hath followed, that the addition of further Empire and territorie, hath beene rather matter of burden, then matter of strength vnto them; yea, and further; it hath kepte aliue the seede and rootes of reuoltes and rebellions, for many ages: As, wee may see in a freshe and notable example of the kingdome of Aragon, which though it were vnited to Castile by mariadge, and not by conquest, and so descended inhereditarie vnion by the space of more then a hundreth years:

yet, because it was continued in a diuided gouernement, and not well incorporated and cemented with the other Crownes; entred into a Rebellion, vpon point of their Fueros, or liberties, now, of very late yeares.
            Now, to speake briefely, of the seuerall partes of that forme, whereby states and kingdomes are perfectly vnited: they are, besides the soueraignety it selfe, foure in number. Vnion in Name, Vnion in Language, Vnion in Lawes, and Vnion in Employmentes.
            
            For Name, though it seeme but a superficiall and outward matter; yet it carrieth much

impression and inchantment. The generall and common name of Grecia, made the Greekes alwayes apt to vnite (though otherwise full of diuisions amongst themselues:) against other nations, who they called Barbarous.
            The He
                     •••
                  tian name, is no small band to knit together, their leagues and confederacies, the faster. The common name of Spaine, no doubt hath beene a speciall meane of the better Vnion and conglutination, of the seuerall kindomes of Castile, Aragon, Granada, Nauarra, Valencia, Catalonia, and the rest: comprehending also now lately Portugall.
            
            
               For Language, it is not needfull to insist vpon it: because both your Maiesties kingdoms, are of one language, though of seuerall Dialects: and the difference so small betweene them, as promiseth rather an inriching of one Language, then a continuance of two.
            For lawes, which are the principall Synewes of gouernment, they be of three natures. Iura, which I will terme Freedomes, or abilities, Leges, and Mores.
            
            For abilities and Freedoms, they were amongst the Romans; of foure kindes, or rather degrees Ius Connubij, Ius Ciuitatis, Ius suffragij, and Ius Petitionis, or Ius honorum. Ius Connubij, is a

thing, in these times, out of vse. For, marriage is open betweene all diuersity of Nations. Ius Ciuitatis answereth to that we call Denization, or Naturalization. Ius suffragij answereth to voyce in Parliament, or voice in election of such, as haue voyce in Parliament. Ius petitionis, aunswereth to place in Councell and office. And, the Romanes did many times seuer these freedoms, granting Ius connubij, sine Ciuitate, and Ciuitatem sine suffragio, &amp; Suffragium sine Iure petitionis, which was commonly with them the last.
            For lawes, it is a matter of curiosity and inconuenience, to seeke eyther to extripate all

particular customes, or, to draw all subiectes to one place or resort of Iudicature and Session. It sufficeth, there be an vniformity in the Principall and fundamentall Lawes, both Ecclesiasticall and ciuill. For, in this point the rule houldes, which was pronounced by an ancient Father, touching the diuersity of rites in the church. For, finding the vesture of the Queene, (in the Psalme) which did prefigure the church, was of diuerse colours: and, finding againe, that Christes Coate was without a seame: hee concludes well, In veste varietas sit, scissura non fit.
            
            
               For Manners, a consent in them is to be sought industriously; but, not to bee inforced. For, nothing amongst people, breedes so much pertinacie, in houlding their customes, as suddaine and violent offer to remooue them.
            And, as for Employments; it is no more, but an indifferent hand, and execution of that verse:

                  Tros, Tyriusué mihi, nulle discrimine agetur.
               
            
            There remaineth onely, to remember out of the grounds of Nature, the two conditions of perfect mixture: whereof the former is Time. For, the

naturall Philosophers say well, that compositio, is opus homines: and Mistio, is opus Naturae. For it is the dutie of man, to make a fitte application of bodies together. But, the perfect fermentation and incorporation of them, must bee left to Nature and Time: and vnnaturall hasting thereof, dooth disturbe the worke, and not dispatche it.
            So, wee see, after the grift is put into the stock, and bound; it must bee left to Nature and Time, to make that continuum, which was at first but contiguum. And, it is not any continuall pressing, or thrusting together: that will preuent Natures
               
season, but rather hinder it. And so, in liquors, those mixtures which are at the first troubled: growe after cleere and setled, by the benefit of rest and time.
            The second condition is: that the greater drawe the lesse. So wee see, when two lights doe meete, the greater dooth darken and drowne the lesse. And, when a smaller riuer, runs into a greater, it leeseth both his name and streame.
            And hereof to conclude, we see an excellent example in the Kingdomes of Iuda and Israel. The Kingdome of Iuda contained two Tribes; the Kingdome of Israel, contained ten.

King Dauid raigned first ouer Iuda, for certaine yeeres: &amp;, after the death of Isbosheth, the sonne of Saul, obtayned likewise the Kingdome of Israel. This vnion continued in him, and likewise in his sonne Salomon, by the space of seuentie yeares at least, betweene them both. But yet, because the seate of the kingdome was kept still in Iuda, and so the lesse sought to drawe the greater; vppon the first occasion offered, the kingdomes brake againe, and so continued, diuided for euer after.
            Thus hauing in all humblenesse made oblation vnto your Maiestie of these simple fruites,

of my deuotion and studies: I do wish (and I do wish it, not in the nature of an impossibilitie, to my thinking,) that this happye vnion of your Maiesties two Kingdomes of England and Scotland; may bee in as good an houre; and vnder the like diuine prouidence, as that was, betweene the Romaines and the Sabines.
            
            FINIS.
