            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

                     GOOD Sir, and courteous freinde,
ſince the tyme of my late deliuery
from captiuitie, I haue
often called to mynde, hovv deſirous
I founde you, to vnderſtand
the truthe of our intentiō,
thoughe litle doubtfull of the
iuſtneſſe of our cauſe: but ſeing the ſuſpitious
Iealouſy of guilty conſcyences, permitted not ſuch
conuerſation as accordeth vvith humaine curteſy:
and that free ſpeach is theare ſo fatr intolerable,
that men are examyned by torture, not ouly of
there indifferent vvoordes, but euen of their very
thoughtes, and future actions, I vviſhed oportunitie
to giue you ſatisfaction, but vſed ſilence, to
auoyde your trooble.
                  Well, ſeing it hathe ſince pleaſed God, to lend
me lyf, liberty, and meanes to ſend vnto you
(vvhich in ſo dangerous and vvatchfull a vvorld is
moſte difficill to be founde) I could not omitt to
vvrite at this preſent, vvhereby your ſelf, and ſuch
others, as to vvhome you may vvith ſafty communicate
it, may be the better ſatisfied.
                  It is to you very apparent, and vvel knovvne to
the vvhole vvorld, hovv it hathe of late pleaſed
God, to diſpoſe of mens actions, according to his
ovvne pleaſure: vvhich vve vvill rather accepte as a
puniſhment for our ſinnes, then take for a diſcouragement

to our cauſe. Neither can our enimyes
therein, receaue any occaſion to be the more
inſolent, or to glory, in that they deſerue not, ſithe
theire valour, neuer made our enterpriſe fruſtrate:
themſelues confeſſing, it vvas not donne by the
puiſance of man, but by the povver of God: vvhich
they let not to ſay, may giue ſufficient proof of
their cauſe: not ſeeming to remember, hovv ſundry
examples can giue teſtimony, of diuers attempts
misfortuned at the firſt, that aftervvard haue ſucceded
vvel: And of all others, that that of the children
of Iſraell is the moſte notable: They being
comaunded, at tvvo ſeuerall tymes, by God himſelf,
to make vvar againſt the tribe of Beniamin,
                     Iudic. cap. 20.
vvere notvvithſtanding at bothe thoſe tymes ouerthrovvne,
vvho yet at the laſte preuailed, to the
great foile and confuſion of there enimyes. And
to giue you an example neerer home, you may
reade,Polid. Virgil. hovv the expedition that Iulius Ceaſer made
into England, not for that the Britaines had aſſiſted
his rebells robbed his treaſure, or entruded themſelues
into his dominions: but only for that they
had aydid the frenche, vvhen he made vvar
againſt them: came at the firſt to no effect, yet
vvere thoſe Britaines no vvhit the more aſſured of
ſecuritie, for the yeare follovving he returned againe,
and gat the victorie.
                  God hathe puniſhed vs for our ſinnes vvhich are
great, but the puniſhment of our faultes, excuſeth
not your far greater offences, your ſuperiours
muſt vvel knovve they haue deſerued a plague, and
their guilty conſciences greatly feare to fynde it,
hovvſoeuer they ſtrugle and ſtriue againſt God, as
did Nemrode, vvhen vvith his Giants he buylded

the tovvre of Babilon,
                     Gene. cap. thincking there vvas no other
way to ouerthrowe there deſignementes, then a
newe inundation.
                  Vaine are thoſe perſuaſions of theirs, that our
loſſes are irrecouerable, and that there remaineth
for vs, neither hope nor comforte. Which yf it were
ſo, yet are not they freed from deſerued vengeance,
and that it is not ſo, a litle tyme can make manifeſt.
Such ſpeaches only argue, that they haue made
a reſolution to run on in all impiety, and to trie
to the vttermoſte, vvhether Gods puiſance or
their vngodly practiſes can moſte preuaile: vvhere
in they ſhall vvell fynde, that he can many wayes
confounde the vvicked, vvhen themſelues ſhall
no vvay preuent it. Meane vvhyle, there outvvarde
courage is mixte vvith invvarde care, and there
fayned Ioy vvith reſtleſſe iealouſy: vvho in ſeeming
to feare nothing, are ſeene to ſtart at their ovvne
ſhadovves.
                  This intolerable feare is more manifeſted in
your Engliſhe Gouernment, then in any ſtate els in
the vvhole vvorld: the great impreſſion thereof
enforcing them, to all their ſpyings abroade, and
inquiſitions at home: ſearchings of houſes more
at midnighte then at noone dayes, apprehenſions,
examinations, and ſuch daily exerciſe, and practiſe
of the racke,

                      as neuer the like vvas hard of: ſtill fynding
by experience, that neuer more labour hathe
bin employed to leſſe purpoſe, thoſe innocents
only able to confeſſe no more, then that vvhich cō
                     cerneth
their ovvne religion and conſcience: notvvithſtanding
all vvhich, the remedies remaining
(rather to patche vp the ſtate of a body ſo far infected,
then to cure an incurable diſeaſe) are principally

grounded, vpon extreme tyranny, and
deepe diſſimulation.
                  Their tyranny is chiefly extended, to the Catholiques
of your owne country, of whome very many
before, and ſundry ſince our diſaſtre, they haue
cruelly executed: and by falſe lying libells after
there deathes, haue ſoughte to inſinuate that they
vvere of conſpiracie vvith vs,
                        
                           〈…〉
                        
                      albeit it pleaſed God
to diſcouer this their great iniuſtice, euen in the
very execution thereof, for tvvo of that nomber
vvich vvere nexte after condemned to deathe for
treaſon, condeſcending throughe frailty, to recant
their religion, vvere forthvvith pardoned, and reſtored
to libertie. Which benefyte of lyf, all the
others mighte aſwell and as eaſely haue enioyed as
they, yf the grace of God, had not in them bin the
greater. Which euidently argueth for vvhat cauſe
they vvere condemned, ſince recantation from
treaſon, after or afore condemnation to death, I
neuer knevve could ſaue a mannes lyf, yf himſelf
liſt.
                  Touching their diſſimulation, being the grounde
and ſubſtance of their, gouernment, and conteyning
the infynite nombers of deceatfull practiſes,
falſe fictions, and ſlaunderous lies, vvhich aſvvell in
the vvorld abroade, as alſo at home, they haue artificially
exercyſed, in euery action, is ſuche a laborinthe
to looke into, that it vvould rather require
a vvhole volume, then a brief relation. I vvil there
fore leaue the nomber of thoſe vnto ſuch as by
longe experience, haue made better obſeruation
then my ſelf: &amp; for breuitie only ſett dovvne, ſome
fevve notable examples of their vntrue ſpeaches,
familiar to your ſelues, vvherevvith they haue

foughte to make odious to the people, to calumniate
and condemne, ſuch as themſelues pleaſed.
By vvhich fevve you may receaue lighte to looke
into the others, and to giue ſuch credit to the like
hereafter, as experience hathe prooued, the former
to deſerue.
                  It may therefore pleaſe yon (amonge many late
rumours of the lyke condition and qualitie) to cal
to remembrance vvhat diſpytefull pamphlets,
and odious reportes, vvere bruited againſt the late
duke of Northfolke, but you may vvel aſſure your
ſelf, that neuer any one man of ſence belieued, that
the ſaid Duke euer intended, to haue fyred London
in fovvre places.
                  You haue hard of images of vvax hidden in the
earthe, vvhereof bothe bookes and ballettes vvere
ſpred aboute the country, that this vvas don by
Catholiques, to conſume the Queene, and ſome

that he vvas a Papiſt, moſte cruelly racked, and
vniuſtly condemned to death. And yon haue vnderſtood
aftervvard, that one Elkes another proteſtant,

the loue of ſome Londoners vvyf.

                  But to dravve to my intended purpoſe, and to
come to that, which concerneth the honnour of
my owne ſoueraigne, the Kinge Catholique of Spaine:
In thoſe particulers whereupon I knovv you
expect my awnſvvere, of vvhoſe myld and ſweete
proceedings, albeit the whole vvorld hathe ſeene
ſufficient proof: vvhoſe very nature abhorreth rigour,
and vvhoſe compaſſionate mynde neuer

to much mercy is rather his faulte, then to ſeuere

iuſtice: and forgiueth the greateſt contempts, that
ſubiects can comitt againſt there ſoueraignes: yet
is he not free from the venemous tonges of ſtinging
vipers, nor exempt from the lying libells of the malitious
Engliſhe. Pardō me good Sir, that I ſpeake
of your nation as I haue cauſe, meaning only thoſe
that haue giuen the ſame: the foule mouthes of
your miniſters neuer ſpared to raile againſt his Catholique
Maieſty, nor no contemptible raſcall, to
reuile him at his pleaſure, nothing vvas more frequēt
then the defaming of my Kynge, nor nothing
omitted that might make him moſt odious.
                  
                     It vvas made a very cleare caſe, that you ſhould
all haue bin broughte vnder the bondage of ſtraungers.
Who had deuyded your country amonge them, &amp; alotted
to themſelues, the landes and lyuings, of all the nobilitie
and Gentlemen of the Realme: That your wyues and
daughters ſhould be violated. That we broughte irons to
mareke your Children vnder the age of ſeauen yeares, to
the end they mighte be knowne, to be come of the people of
a Conquered country. And that your Goods ſhould be
robbed and taken from you, &amp;c.
                  To anſvvere all which (ſince you ſomtyme vrged
me, when the tyme nothing ſerued to giue you ſatisfaction)
I am novv to deſire you, firſte to conſider,
that the queſtiō vvhether his Catholique Maieſty,
hathe iuſte cauſe or not, to make vvar againſt
England, is ſo cleare a caſe, that no man honeſt and
vviſe, can in his conſcience doubte thereof. And yf
vve looke back into former tymes, vve ſhall fynde

farr leſſe matters, then the longe taking parte vvith

all vvhich ſiniſter dealings, haning bin long ſhadowed,

ſuch foule and ſhamleſſe manner, as is odious to all

into his tovvnes and countries, on the other ſyde:
all after a very vile and theeviſ he faſſion. Hauing

it ſhould proceede from the people, noman can
deeme, that it comes from the prince, noman can
deny. Whether the reuenge of the faultes of a fewe,
ſhould generally extend to the vtter ruyne, &amp; ſubuerſion
of a vvhole nation, no reaſon can proue:
neither hathe ſuch reuenge bin alvvaies comon to
pagans and infidells, muche leſſe once ment by a
Chriſtian king, and moſt clement prince. Looke
vvhether his proceedings haue bin tyrannous, tovvard
any of his ovvne ſubiects: and vvhether euer
any haue entred into more outragious rebellions,
then thoſe of the lovve countries, vvho after there
longe miſdemeamour, did at the lenghte euen vtterly
renounce &amp; abiure him: receyued the Duke

of Alençon of fraunce, inueſted him into the Duchie
of Brabant, and ſvvare vnto him obedience. All
vvhich actiōs of theirs, hauing had ſuche ſucceſſe,
as commonly enſueth the equity of ſuch cauſes:
and many of their cities, ſince reduced vnto his
Maieſties obedience, no one man of them all, hathe
for any his former offences bin executed.
                  Truthe it is, that the Duke of Alua, did heretofore
vſe ſome ſeueritie tovvards them, yet not
other then they had deſerued, and for one executed
by him, your iuſtice of England vvould haue hāged
an hundreth, yf the like caſe had bin theirs. But
notvvithſtanding that this vvas donne, by due and
lawfull iuſtice, yet vvas it ſo farr diſagreable to his
Maieſties mynde, that the ſaid Duke beeing called
into Spaine: of all the Gouernours vvhich ſince that

And ſuch ſubiects of his, that as rebells do yet
remaine out vnpardoned, are themſelues the cauſe
thereof, becauſe they ſeeke it not.
                  It is further to be conſidered, that there is no
Kynge in Europe, that hathe more different natiōs,
of more diuers landes &amp; languages to his ſubiects,
then his Maieſty hathe. The entire Monarchie of

                     Spaine, conteyning ſundry kyngedomes, is gouerned
in one moſte flouriſhinge and peaceable eſtate,
and the Prouince of Portugall, newly anexed there

it was in other tymes afore. The nobilitie thereof,

that they had maturely cōſidered the cauſe, together
with his maieſties mercyfull diſpoſition, &amp; lefte of
to preferr the pretence of Don Anthonio: were not

                     der, that there is nothing that can poſſibly,
more moue and ſtir vp the indignation of a Prince,
then the open diſloyall and repugnant inſolency,
of his owne people. And that no ſubiects in our
dayes, haue exceeded his, all the vvorld will witneſſe.
Notwithſtanding all which, looke whether
any bloudy, cruel, or vnchriſtian deſire of reuenge,
hathe apeered in him, and looke whether it be poſſible
that more lenity mighte be ſhewed vnto
ſuch, then his Maieſty hathe donne. The truthe
whereof, beeing ſo apparent, plaine &amp; manifeſt,
I leaue vnto your owne ſelf in cōſcyēce to diſcerne
whether theaſe examples of his Maieſties proceedings,
will not ſufficiently awnſwere, vnto all
the calumnies and lies, that his aduerſaries can
poſſibly inuent to make him odious. Looke whether
after ſuch a generall reuolt wherein ſo many
had ſo iuſtly deſerued to looſe bothe their liues, &amp;
liuings, whether their lands are deuyded to ſtraungers,
there wyues violated, their Children marcked
with hot Irons, there goods robbed and taken from
them, &amp;c. Or rather, whether they do not liue in all
ſecuritie and quiet poſſeſſion of their owne. And
yf by reaſon of the reſtrainte of their trafique they
are not preſently in their former aboundance, they
may wholly impute that vnto you, beeing the only

cauſe theerof. But of the like compaſſion had
of a Prince on his people, yon cannot ſhevve any
examples paſte or preſent, in the whole world.
                  This Sweete and gratious diſpoſition of his Maieſty,
beeing ſo publyke, &amp; notorious, how is it poſſible,
that euer ſuch vnchriſti
                        •
                      cruelty, could more
be intended to the Engliſhe nation, then to any
others: or that any man offence can imagine, why
he ſhould more hate them, then any his owne
treacherous and rebellious ſubiects. His great
wiſdome well ſeeing, and obſeruing, that the
originall of this rancour, principally proceedeth
from ſome fewe in preſent aucthoritie, whoſe
vngratious deſignes are executed by perſons,
neither of honour, nor honeſty. And others of
the vulgar ſorte of people, who with applauſe of
their ſuperiours, concurr in theaſe courſes: he can
well diſcerne, rather to do it of litle diſcretion,
then of great malice: themſelues not beeing of
capacitie, to conſider the equitie, or iuſtneſſe of the
cauſe. And his Maieſty eſpetially conſidereth, that
great multytudes, are ouer borne, by the impious
tyranny, of powrable perſons, ontwardly to condeſcend
to that, which inwardly they contemne:
ſuſtayning contrary to the nature of ſo noble a Nation,
the generall reproche of particuler mens
diſhonorable actions: whoſe caſe doubtleſſe, he
dothe rather pittie, then deſire to puniſh.
                  All the world knoweth that his Maieſty hathe
euer had a moſt ſinguler affection to the Engliſhe
people, and your ſelues by experience haue perfectly
found it. There could neuer kynge cōdeſcēd
to cōditions more honorable &amp; profitable for you,
then his Maieſty did at his beeing in England.

I ſuppoſe mōſieur of fraunce, in his late mocke mariage,
neuer offred you the like. His Maieſties actiōs
were withoute diſſimulatiō, as the cōſequēce well
declared, for beeing maried to your Queene, and
proclaymed Kynge, yet ſoughte not to ſetle himſelf
in the Crowne: nor to poſſeſſe any portes, townes,
or caſtells, in the whole countrie. But after the
deceaſſe, of the moſte vertuous Queene Mary his
wyf, gaue place and quyet entrance vnto the Lady
Elizabeth. Giuing alſo vnto her, all his ſaid wyues
Iewells, which himſelf mighte iuſtly haue claymed
and kepte. And preſently after her coming to
the crowne, he then being vpon conditions to
cōclude a peace with the frenche kynge, vppō the
taking of S. Quintines, did moſte earneſtly ſtick, at
the rēdringe of the towne of Calis, to the Engliſhe
againe: ſhe hauing at that preſent her ambaſſadors
there, and as it ſeemed, for the ſame purpoſe, but
after his Maieſty had ſo earneſtly vrged this matter,
that vnleſſe it mighte be graunted there could
be no accorde the french then flatly confeſſed, that
notwithſtanding the Engliſhe ontwardly ſolicited
for Calis: yet they had ſecretly aſſured them,
that their Queene cared not therefore: which
his Maieſty afterward founde ſo in dede, and perceaued
the fraude, that it imported. But to leaue

with you in England: and ſee with what affable

bounty and beneuolence, in very meere giftes, and
liberalities, to ſundry nations in generall, are ſo
great: that he freely giueth away by the yeare, more
then the Queene of England can yearely diſpend.
What ſhould I be tedious to ſtand vppon thoſe
points, that his enemyes intend, to haue bin his
intention: or the termes of tyranny, that euery
hedge miniſter, can amplyfy againſt vs.
                  That you ſhould all haue bin broughte vnder
the bondage of ſtrangers, who had made deuiſion
of your lands and lyuings amonge themſelues,
as thoughe all Spaine, and Portugall, the Indies, eaſt
and weſt, Italy, and the lowe Countries, yea almoſte
half the world, were ſo peſtred with people: that
there were no habitation lefte for vs, but that we
muſt needes by daunger of ſea and land, ſeeke to
take it from you perforce: whereas you may well

knowe, there hathe no neceſſitie conſtreyned vs,
to abandon our landes, and liuings, in our owne
naturall and ample country of Spaine, which we
prefer before any ſeptentrionall region. And albeit
we were enforced to change our reſidence, yet can
we make choiſe of many places, as frutefull and
pleaſant as England is, and obtaine them, with farr
leſſe difficulty. It may be, that this perſuaſion of
danger to looſe there landes, hathe moued ſundry
of your gentlemen of late dayes, to ſell away theirs,
and to purchaſe more aſſured credit, haue ſett
themſelues forvvard in great brauery, to be ſeene
in your ſeruice, for the which I doubte not, but
they haue bin rewarded▪ with kynde courtly countenances:
and are in poſſibilitie, ſo ſoone as occaſion
ſhall require,Protections are the beſt revvards that they are to expect. with eaſy ſute (for there full recompence)
to obtaine protections, that no officer
ſhall arreſt them, when they ſhall haue leſſe mony
then land.
                  Your impudent miniſters, whoſe mouthes are
made the trompets, to ſounde oute vntruthes: can
tell you as confidently, as had they bin of the Kynges
counſell, into what great bondage you ſhould
haue bin broughte, and how-much you liberty,
ſhould haue bin abridged. Maruell not that theſe
companions, call your reformation a conqueſt:
and condemne the moſte Clement Kynge of the
world, of intended cruellty it behoueth them
moſte, to ſpeake in this matter, and to exercyſe to
the vttermoſte, the loudnes of their lying, becauſe
it concerneth aſwell their owne benefyte, as thoſe
from whome they receaue their inſtructions, perhapps

                     Royall and Noble ſermon lefte vnmade,The ordinary prices of ſermons. wherewith
theaſe wedded prieſts of Baal, do maintaine their
women, and new generation.
                  This bondage ſemeth to be the more grieuous,
becauſe it is ſaid to be vnder ſtraungers: would to
God there were leſſe difference, betweene Chriſtian
and Chriſtian, and more diſcord, betwene
Engliſhe,
                     The rebelles 
                           〈…〉

fyfty thowſand ſtraungers amonge you, more then
twenty yeares together, and therefore you mighte
the better beare, a ſmaller number.
                  That your wyues and daughters ſhould be deflowred,
is a matter, that more men then miniſters
cannot brooke, and yet ſeldome amonge ſoldiers
not guyded by good diſciplyne, this plague in particuler
is incident, but hereunto can I tell you,
that your liberty of the late Goſpell hathe prouyded
a more ſufficient remedy, to auoyde this incō
                     uenience,
then any other: inſomuch that ſuch of
the ſoldiers themſelues, as were ſo ill diſpoſed,
could tell, that they ſhould fynde harlots more
then enoughe, alredy prouided.
                  Thoſe tirrible tales, that we broughte Irons
wherewith to marke your Children, vnder the
age of ſeauen yeares, to the end they mighte be
knowne, to be the race of a conquered nation, do
doubtleſſe ſounde moſte lamentably: but to comforte
you herein, thus much may I ſay, that albeit a
man do vtterly refuſe to belieue them, I dare
warrant him, he ſhall neuer be damned, for that
incredulitie: but by the way I could wiſhe you to
note, that yf they did not thinke they had framed
the people to belieue what they liſt they would
neuer feede them with ſuch palpable vntruthes,

and yf therefore you ſhall thinke them, to haue
as litle honeſty, as they thinke you to haue witt,
you ſhall do them no iniury at all.
                  That your goods ſhould be robbed and taken
from you, you neede not greatly feare, for it ſemeth
that now of late, more then here-tofore, her Maieſties
collectours and receyuers, haue taken ſuch
order to take it from you, to ſaue it from vs: that
they haue ſent it oute of England to Zealand, and
other places ouer the ſeas, wherefore you needed
not feare this miſery: but rather haue hoped, that
Spaniſh piſtolets, ſhould haue bin more comon
and currant in England, then euer they were afore.
To the other ridiculous, and friuolous forgeries,
that we broughte halters to hange you, and whips
to whip you, I can ſay litle, other then that I am
very ſory, that in all this ample prouiſion, we forgat
to bring whetſtones to giue to thoſe that
told you this, and bables for ſuch as did belieue
them.
                  But to leaue all ſuch abſurd lies, to the wiſdomes
of the creditors, it is more neceſſary to ſee whereunto
they ſerued, &amp; whether theire further meaning,
may thereby be made manifeſt. The truthe is, and
eaſely it dothe appere, that they were not only inuented,
to make them moſte odious, that ment
you leaſt euill: but alſo to blynde and bleare, the
eyes of the people, by putting into there heades,
the feares of future miſeries, to the end they
ſhould the leſſe behold, there owne preſent calamyties,
and thoſe that by their improuident practiſes
are ſure to enſue, albeit they neuer had neede
to feare any forraine enimy: but to leade dryue
and diſpoſe of you, as of brute beaſts, withoute

ſoules, ſence, or vnderſtanding: where &amp; to what,
themſelues like and allowe, euer prouyding to
keepe you in ignorance, and principally of that,
which moſte concerneth your owne comon welfare:
as amonge others it plainely appeereth, in the
prohibiting vnder great paine, &amp; deuiſing of othes
of aſſociation, that none may once moue, or call
in queſtion to knowe, who is to ſuccede their
Queene, after her deathe: as thoughe it were
treaſon to ſay ſhe ſhould die, or an inſufferable
cryme to knowe that, whereof they mighte receaue
comforte, of continuing their owne quyet, after
her deceaſe. And as thoughe they deſyred all felicity
to end with them, not caring what confuſion,
ciuill diſcention, and bloudſhedd, mighte
afterward fall amonge the Engliſhe, by the
Engliſhe themſelues. A reſolution doubtleſſe
moſte indurable, and vnchriſtian: vnnaturall is that
father, that throughe inordinate auarice, leaueth
his family to fall to all diſcorde and diſcention. But
impious is that prince, that in preſeruing diſordered
pleaſure, leaueth the people in ſuch poſſibilitie
to be killed, in the confuſion of ſo many competitours.
                  But lett vs looke into leſſe matters then theaſe,
and ſee whether they deny not, the very priuileges
of reaſonable creatures, prohibiting by publyke
comaundement, that none may once aſke or enquyre,
how thinges do ordinarily paſſe in the
world abrode. Neither to demaunde, heare, read,
or write, any newes of any matter whatſoeuer, be
it true or vntrue: yea ſcarſly of that, which toucheth
mens priuate negotiatiōs. The only reſtrayning
of which free ſpeech, is of it ſelf a very

euydent and ſufficient ſigne, of a Tyrannous eſtate,
and a markable ſuſpition, of ſiniſter dealing. By
this brydle you are rayned and broughte, to all
beaſtly &amp; ſlauiſhe ſeruytude, withoute any knowledge
or conſideration, either of reaſon, cauſe, or
conſcyence, of that wherein bothe your bodies and
ſoules are employed: and ſomuch of your ſubſtancontributed,
which to the menaginge of theaſe vniuſt
quarrels haue bin ſo great and ſo grieuous,
that it hathe exceeded all the former ſubſidies and
exactiōs, that any ſeauen of your princes predeceſſours,
haue had of their ſubiects, to make their lawfull
warres. You pay, what they pleaſe to demaūde,
you beare what they liſt to lay vppon you, you
are made to ſay and ſoothe, to whatſoeuer they
will, be it neuer ſo falſe, fonde, and vnlykely: you
are preſſed, compelled, vnpaied, clapte vnder hatches,
and caryed you knowe not where, nor to
what end, &amp; when ſuch of you as are lefte aliue, do
returne home againe (yf not caryed ſick throughe
the ſtreats of London by whole carte loades, in
the Lord of Leceſter his Trophee) you ſee how
you are rewarded, and how your creditt and condition
is encreaſed, by that it was afore.
                  You are cutt of from all trade and trafique, with
the moſte ritche, and opulent countries aboute
you, retaining no hope of any outward comoditie,
other then can be gotten by robbery and piracie.
The proſperitie whereof you fynde ſuch, that you
ſee your ſelues no whitt thereby diſburdened, of
any your encreaſing ſubſidies, and exactions.
                  This great miſery and dayly deſolation, dothe
more and more make, your Gentlemen bare, and
your Marchants banckrupte, it conſumeth the

                     Comons, and continually waſteth the wealth of the
Realme: As wiſemen do ſee, thoughe they dare
not ſay it, and all men do fynde, thoughe they do
not ſee it. It would exceede the compaſſe of a
letter, to lay open vnto you euery important
affliction, but that ſhall not neede, for experience
will teach you to deſcerne them, each day more
then other, and you ſhall further feele the ſmart,
before you fynde the remedy.
                  Wo woorthe the cauſers of your calamities,
who for their owne priuate ambitious deſire to
rule, haue run on, in all deſperate and dangerous
attempts whatſoeuer: and haue laſtly by violence,
drawne vppon their owne heades, that which neither
thēſelues, nor the whole Realme can vphold.
                  Where are now thoſe infallible groundes, that
your great Machiaueliſt, laide downe at the begining,
when he ſo boldly preſumed to alter religion,
and to begin his new Goſpell, with an extraordinary
gouernement, whoſe reſolutions to continew
the Republique, were according to the direction
of the vnholy Ghoſte, in the determyninge
of religion.
                  The firſt was, to eſtabliſhe their eſtate, by maintayning
rebellions of the ſubiects of France, Flaunders,
and Scotlande.
                  
                  That failing, the ſecond was, by the credit that
they had in the lowe Countries, to giue and
tranſpoſe parte thereof to the frenche: and thereby
to kindle a warr, betweene the two houſes, of
fraunce and Spaine.

how your dealings, are lyked and allowed, of other

to giue you one example. At ſuch tyme as it

to entrude herſelf into his Maieſties dominiōs,
a marchant of the lowe Countries, arryuing at

whether it were true that the Queene, of
England had put herſelf in poſſeſſion of any the
Kynge of Spaine his countries, or townes there, yea
quoth he it is true: Then quoth the Kynge, ſhe

your ſelf, or any indifferent Engliſhe

proteſtant, whoſe zeale dothe not ouerbeare his

much and ſo many wayes ſeeming to be troobled,
is ſo litle pittied of other people in the world
abroade. And beeing gouerned by a woman, your

                  When I enter into conſideration, of the preſent
ſtate of your country, I call to remembrance, that
at my beeing at Salamanca, ſome fyue yeares paſte,
an Engliſhe Gentleman ſhewed me, the woorke
of an old Engliſhe poet, beeing the moſte renowmed,
that euer wrote in the Engliſhe tounge: in the
begining whereof were certaine verſes, which in
manner of a propheſy, ſo perfectly diſcribed then,

the future ſtate of England, that at this day, it is the
very liuely pourtraict thereof ad Viuum. I requeſted
of him the ſence in Spaniſhe, and the meeter in
Engliſhe, which is thus.

to talke of old propheſies: yet haue I preſumed

Catholique, which had ſo lōge laſted, &amp; ſo vniuerſally

defect of faith, hathe in a ſhort ſeaſon ſo ſufficiently

change: all eſtates encreaſe, diminiſh, are toſſed,

Royall: and the very flowre of the Nobility of
England, with infynite other valiant perſonages,
beſydes ſundry Lords and gentlemen, conſumed

in priſons at home, or enforced abroade in baniſhment,
miſerably to end the reſt of their dayes. In
this great confuſion, each party as they preuailed,
condemned the other for traitors: that in the end,
all the whole nobilitie and people, were on the one
and the other ſyde, ſo taken and vſed. Since which
tyme, euen of late, in our owne age and memory,
we haue ſeene ſundry chaunges: amonge all
which, our Lord delt moſte mercifully, when moſte
daunger was feared: at what tyme, Iohn Dudley
Duke of Northumberlaend, hauing maryed the Lady
Iane to one of his ſonnes, and proclaymed them
Kynge and Queene, thereby to exclude and cut of
the righte of Queene Mary, and pretence of Elizabeth,
it pleaſed the deuyne prouydēce ſo to diſpoſe,

the puniſhment only extēded, to the principall
parties, and ſome fewe acceſſaries themſelues,
                  Thus may ſundry examples of your owne
changes ſhewe you, that alterations are no newe
thinges: but that they are bothe comon and generall.
Neither can any be ſo ſenceleſſe (althoughe
ſuche great iniquity had neuer bin cōmitted) as to
think your eſtate were euer ſtable, or that no new
gouernment, did not euer bringe at the leaſt, the
change of many mens particuler eſtates.
                  But the caſe beeing now ſuch as it is, that his
Catholique Maieſty, is not only highly iniuried,
and continually vrged: but the whole repoſe and
quyet of Chriſtendome ſo diſturbed, that either his
Maieſty or ſome other prince, muſt of force ſeeke
the reformation of your country: not for any particuler
comoditie, but for a generall good. Whereunto
in truthe, his Maieſty is eſpecially more

obligated, then any other: inſomuch, that yf there
were no cauſe at all of religion to moue him, yet
in regard of the comon iniuryes, dayly donne
vnto him, he is euen bounde in righte, reaſon, and
iuſtice, to do it: &amp; that yf neither he, nor any other
ſhould attempte theſame, you are notwithſtanding

Crowne apparently knowne, and ſo many competitiours,

the plague of ciuill war, will be eaſier, then

can I ſee, how you can auoyde the leaſte of them
bothe. Neither do you deſire with Dauid, rather to
fall into the handes of God, then into the handes

ſhall not be confounded with the impious, but
rather, that many multitudes by there meanes may
be ſaued.
                  It may alſo ſtand with his great goodneſſe, to
make his Catholique Maieſty the meane, for the
recouery thereof, not to conquer, or make mutation,
of auncient lawes and liberties, which he neuer
intended: but only to reduce it, to the old concorde

of Maye, 1589.

               AFTER that I had finiſhed this my letter,
vnderſtanding that throughe defaulte of
wynde, together with ſome difficulty that the meſſenger
put, about his more ſafe and ſpeedy paſſage:
he was not lyke to departe ſo ſoone, as himſelf
had promiſed, and I expected, I therefore detained
this letter, ſome dayes in my handes vnſealed, attending
ſuche oportunitie, as mighte neereſt concurr
to our deſires.
            In the meane ſeaſon, I vnderſtood by letters
from Roan, that the great and extraordinary engliſhe
fleete, furniſhed at the charges of ſo many,
who either of force, or fauour, had ſtreyned themſelues
to ſerue,
                  
                     〈…〉
                  . they knew not well whome, where,
nor when: yet now, after long delay, great counſell,
and correſpondence of freinds, they were departed,
from the weſt parte of England, aboute the
firſt of May, ſtilo nouo: vnder the conduct (by ſea)
of the glorious &amp; famous man Sir, Frauncis Drake,
who a litle before, had promiſed the Queene his
miſtres, to bring the Kynge of Spaine to very great
pouerty, and miſery. And the charge of ſeruice by
land, was committed to Sir Iohn Noris, whoſe experience,
the engliſhe were woont greatly to magnify.
The reſt of their Captaines, and ſoldiers, were
the beſt that they had: hauing retyred the principall
of thoſe, from thoſe partes of the low countries,
which they preſently poſſeſſe.
            Very ſhortly after, I vnderſtood by other letters,
from the afore ſaid place, and the ſame party. That
the Engliſh were arryued, not very farr from St.
Iames in Galitia. Perhaps with ſome intention in
their way, to haue viſited that place, of eſpeciall deuotion,
to the riches and ornaments there. Where

albeit, that very many ſtrangers, from all partes of
Europe: according to an old cuſtome of chriſtians,
do continually come on pilgrimage. And that vnto
ſuch, the inhabitants thereaboutes do freely giue
leaue, and relief: Yet they now ſeeing the Engliſh
to approche, in a manner muche different from
other pilgrimes, haue accordingly giuen them a
farr other kynde of entertaiment, inſomuch (that
as my freind writeth) thoſe that lately ſo arrogantly
boaſted, of ſome detrimēt of ours: which all
rhe world knoweth, came not throughe engliſhe
power or puiſance, but by the very wyndes, and
ſeas, which it pleaſed God to permitt to our puniſhment:
Haue now receyued ſuch a check, for
that inſolencie, that they may ſee our ſelues are
made the inſtruments, by our owne armes, to chaſtice
them. Touching the manner and particularities,
I cannot at this preſent fully certify you. Thoſe
your ſelf may there, better vnderſtand, yf you haue
any ſecrett freind in courte, otherwiſe you ſhall
hardly come by the certainty, for I feare it wilbe
made treaſon to talke thereof, among the comon
ſorte of men.
            Yf you can come by the names of thoſe men of
marke: number of ſoldiers, ſhipps, and artillery,
that you haue loſt: I pray you vſe ſome meanes, to
ſend them ouer, becauſe I wold gladly ſee, how
our aduiſes ſhall differ. The author of the late
pamphlet, printed at London in Engliſh, &amp; frenche,
and entituled. The copie of a letter ſent from England to
don Bernardine de Mendoza, Ambaſſador in Fraunce for
the Kyng of Spaine, no doubte, yf he will take the
paines, can very well pen it to the print, becauſe
I knowe, he will cary a great care, aboute

the putting downe of euery particuler.
            And wheras in the beginning of that letter, the
author ſeemeth to be very ſad and ſorowfull:A counterfait Catholique. after
ſo late, and long expected comforte, to haue an occaſion
to ſignify the lamentable loſſe, and vtter diſſolution,
of all hope. Now I can aſſure him, he may
make a peece of amends, in ſending ouer at this
tyme ſuch good newes, as can ſomwhat counteruaile
the former ill: And yf it ſhall pleaſe him to
make an eſtimate, of the one &amp; the others loſſes, to
ſee who hathe ſuſtayned the greater: he muſt alſo
ſett downe ſome reaſons, to ſhewe which of bothe
is beſt able to beare it, &amp; the moſte lyke, ſooneſt to
recouer it: for by theaſe conſiderations, a man ſhall
ſureſt come to the certainety. Thus good Sir, vnderſtanding
of this bearers preſent occaſion to departe,
who now attendeth the cloſing vp of my letter,
I am enforced heere to conclude. Once
more committing you to God, &amp; wiſhing
you moſt hartely well to fare.
Iune 1589.
