            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            THE COVNSELLER A Treatiſe of Counſels and Counſellers of Princes, written in Spaniſh by Bartholomew Phillip, Doctor of the Ciuill and Cannon lawe.
            
               Engliſhed by I. T. Graduate in Oxford.
            
            LONDON Printed by Iohn Wolſe. 1589.
         
         
            
            
            TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE M. IOHN FORteſcue Eſquier, Maiſter of her Maieſties great Garderobe, and one of her moſt honorable prinie Counſell, Iohn Thorius wiſheth health and honor, with accompliſhment of all Heroicall deſires.
            
            
               I Preſent vnto your honor the very Idaea of a Counſeller not ſhadowed (in truth) with curious eloquence of wordes, but in his kind abſolute and perfite. Such an Orator Tullie, ſuch a king Patritius, ſuch a wiſe man Salomon commendeth vnto vs: as, fit and needfull to be propounded, like a maſterpeece for example, though hard to be expreſſed in full perfection. The booke written in the Caſtilian tongue by Barthol. Phillippus D. of the lawes, was commended by manie my good friends, men of great iudgement, and thought worthie for deſert, and profitable for

vſe thereof, to be imparted to our Nation: and diuerſe of them (whoſe will is ſufficient commandement, and requeſt perſwaſion for me) earneſtly entreated mee to imploy ſome time in tranſlating thereof, for the ſeruice of ſuch Noblemen and Gentlemen (whereof they ſaid there is no ſmall number) as not wel ſeene in the Caſtiliā language, are deſirous to vnderſtand, what this Spaniard doth bring vnder ſo glorious a title for the direction or furniture of their eſtate. Which, vndertaken and ended, I was ſoone reſolued to whom I ſhould and ought to addreſſe it. For the booke intreating of Counſell &amp; Counſellers (which, Plato worthily calleth 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) could not more properly be ſubmitted to any then your honnor, whom her Maieſtie, a Prince of ſo excellent iudgement, hath after her long experience of your rare perfections called to her honorable priuie Counſell, in this time which requireth extraordinarie habilitie and wiſedome. And to whom might I without iuſt note of great ingratitude, offer my labour in this kind, before him to whoſe honorable fauour both my parents and my ſelfe haue bin

and are infinitely beholding? For although I am not ignorant that your honor vnderſtandeth the Author in his owne tongue, and neede not to bee endebted to any Spaniard for precepts or directions in your eſtate, yet I truſt you will not be diſpleaſed, that vnder your fauour and protection he may enforme thoſe young Gentlemen, whoſe vnexperienced yeares and want of knowledge in this language will be content to conferre with him, and ſerue themſelues of me for an interpretour. To your honour therefore I leaue this booke as yours (if you pleaſe to auow it) 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , but 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                theirs to whom ſuch helpes be not ſuperfluous. The Method which the author vſeth, hath receiued contrarie cenſures of diuerſe iudgements: but I meane not here to defende him, who in truth hath no neede of ſo meane a Patron, for that my end onely is faithfully to deliuer his meaning in ſuch order as himſelfe had diſgeſted it. Which my labour I ſhall thinke abundantly rewarded, and beſides my ſelfe much bound vnto your honour, if you ſhall accept it as a ſigne of my thankefull minde, which honnourable

courteſie, your former fauours make mee hope for at your handes. Thus I leaue your honour, to your affaires of greater moment, with my prayers to God, to direct all your counſelles and aduices to the maintenance of the Church without ſciſme, and the commonwealth without trouble.

               ❧ A Treatiſe of counſell, and Counſellers of Princes. (
                  •
               )
            
               The firſt diſcourſe from whence Counſels doe proceede, and of the execution of that which is determined in counſels.
               
                  THE holie ghoſt, who is light vnto them that follow him, mercie vnto them that feare him, ioy vnto them that loue him, viſiteth our ſoules, (as the Prophet Eſay
                  Eſay. 11. 2. ſaith) with ſeuen diuine gifts, which are: The ſpirit of wiſedom: of vnderſtanding: of counſell: of fortitude: of knowledge: of pietie: and of the feare of the Lord. Theſe ſeuen gifts of the holie Ghoſt, are the ſeuen eyes, which the Prophet Zacharie ſawZacharie. 3. 9. ſet vpon a ſtone. The ſtone whereon Zacharie ſawe the ſeuen eyes placed, is our Redéemer, and Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as the glorious Saint Ierome declareth. For in the holie Scripture, the ſtone ſignifieth our Redéemer and Lord, as he himſelfeMatth. 21. 42 taught, when he declared that which king Dauid ſaid: ThatPſalme. 118. 22. the ſtone which the builders refuſed, is become the head ſtone of the corner: which cloſeth all the whole worke, and giueth perfection to the building. Saint Paule following this interpretation,1. Corin. 10. 4. Exodus. 17. ſaith: That the ſtone out of the which the Water did ſpring, of the which the people of Iſraell did drinke in the deſert, ſignified our Redéemer and Lord. The Prophet Zacharie
                  Zacharie. 3. ſaith, that he ſaw ſeuen eyes placed in a ſtone, for to ſhew, that the bleſſed ſoule of our Redéemer and Lord Jeſus Chriſt, was moſt perfectlie indued with the ſeuen gifts of the holie Ghoſt, as well in the morrall vertues as intellectuall, and in all the other graces, which through the vnion with the diuineNic. de lira. ſupra. 3. Zacha. eſſence, are communicated with the ſoule of our Redéemer and Lord, as I more at large haue ſhewed in the Treatiſe which I wrote vpon the Créede of the Apoſtles.
               2 Among thoſe gifts with which the holie Ghoſt doth lighten our ſoules, the Prophet Eſay putteth the ſpirit of Counſell and Fortitude. The ſpirit of Counſell (as Saint Thomas
                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉

declareth it) is a certaine light, wherewith the holie ghoſt illuminateth our vnderſtanding, that ſo we may be able to chooſe that which we ought to doo in humane affaires. For the wiſedome of man faileth in manie things, which it cannot reache nor attaine vnto: eſpecially if they be particular things, which in ſundrie places, &amp; at diuers times may fall out diuerſlie; and when we folow our own humane wiſdom, we run into great danger of our life. And therefore Salomon ſaith: That the diſcourſes of men are weake, and their prouidence verie vncertaine,Wiſdom. 9. and that to aſſure our ſelues in this life wherein we liue ſo full of danger and darknes, we ought in no caſe to truſt vnto our owne wiſedome, but deſire God to lighten our vnderſtanding. For (as the Prophet Eſay ſaith) GOD is a meruailousEſay, 3. Prouerb. 3. Counſeller. This dooth king Salomon teach vs when he ſaith: Truſt in the Lord with all thy hart, and truſt not to thine own wiſedome: and ſet God before thee in all thy waies, and he wil direct thy ſteps, &amp;c. And becauſe the wiſedom of man is not ſufficient, to attaine to the truth of each thing in matters concerning counſell, it is commonlie ſaid that God is he which ſheweth that which is to be doone.
               3 Well did king Dauid vnderſtand this, when in the war which he waged againſt his ſonne Abſolon, he praied to God, that the counſell of Achitophel might not be beléeued. Achitophel
                  2. Regum. 15. was ſo wiſe in thoſe counſels which he gaue, (as wel whē he ſerued Dauid as when he folowed Abſolon) that they rather ſéemed to be prophecies reuealed by GOD then humane counſels. And for this cauſe, king Dauid much more feared the counſels of Achitophel, then the battails and ambuſhes of Abſolon.
                  
                     
                        •
                     . Regum. 16. And to the end he might make fruſtrate the coūſel which Achitophel gaue to Abſolon, he ſaid vnto Chuſai the Archite (who came to ſerue him) that he ſhould folow Abſolon, and ſay vnto him: I will be thy ſeruant O king, and I will ſerue thée as in times paſt I haue ſerued thy father: that if Abſolon did admit him to his counſaile, he ſhould croſſe all that euer Achitophel counſailed Abſolon. By the meanes of the Prieſtes who were called Sadoch and Abiathar, Chuſai did the ſame which king Dauid commaunded him, and preſented himſelfe before Abſolon, who aſking him why he folowed not his friend Dauid: he anſwered, Lord I folow thée, and will ſerue thee,

becauſe GOD and the people haue choſen thée to be the King. Abſolon beléeued that to be true which Chuſai ſaid. And wheras Achitophel counſelled that he might be ſuffered to chooſe out twelue thouſand men, and ſo ſet vpon king Dauid, and eaſilie ouercome him, and thoſe who folowed him, becauſe they were all of them very wearie and full of feare: Chuſai croſſed his counſel, and vrged Abſolon to the contrarie. So that Abſolon and thoſe that were with him, liked and approoued Chuſai his counſell. Then Achitophel ſéeing that Abſolon would not follow the counſell that he gaue him, hanged himſelfe. Héerein is it manifeſtlie ſéene, that it is an ordinarie rule of Gods prouidence, alwaies when through his ſecret iudgments, he will puniſh the faults and ſinnes of men: that firſt they looſe their vnderſtanding, to the end that they may not vnderſtand nor iudge of the truth: and beſides (to make thoſe whom he will correct and puniſh, the more miſerable and wretched) he ſuffereth (as Velleyus Paterculus ſaith) the ill ſucceſſe of the matter, to be attributed and imputed vnto the fault and error of thoſe whom he will puniſh: and he blindeth the vnderſtanding of men, to the end they ſhould not oppoſe themſelues againſt him: and ſéeketh all meanes that are neceſſarilie required, to bring that to paſſe which he will haue. And as it is commonlie ſaid, to ſhun that which fortune and chance will haue, is the readie waie toGene. 41. find it: as it is ſéene in that which hapened to Ioſeph and his brethren.
               4 The Prophet Eſay did not without great cauſe ioyne the ſpirit of Fortitude, with the ſpirit of Counſel: for litle profiteth counſell, if vertue and ſtrength be wanting, to execute that which by counſell is determined. And becauſe of thoſe that neither can, nor know how to execute, Cornelius Tacitus ſaith: That when matters goe to wracke, euerie man commaunds, but no man taketh in hand to bring that to effect which is commaunded.Polienus ſ

                  Iphicrates béeing aſked why he would not encounter with the enemie: he anſwered, becauſe he ſaw many commaund, but few obey. And becauſe of theſe that cannot tel how to bring ſuch matters to effect, as is by counſell concluded: the holie Scripture ſaith: That the time of child-bedde draweth néere, and the▪ mother hath no ſtrength to be brought to bedde. And this is vnderſtood by the Fable of the Rats, which were

in counſell, which of them ſhould hang the bell on the Cat. And by our Spaniſh prouerbe.

He would haue that thoſe things which are counſailed, ſhould be executed after ſuch an order, that the execution be done in due time and place. And this is it that Saluſt calleth Mature facere, to wit: that it be neither greene nor rotten. And after this order, doo Aulus Gellius and Macrobius declare thatLib. 10. cap. 11. Saturnal. lib. 6 Lib. 1. Aeneid. of Virgil, Maturate fugam:
                   as if Neptune had ſaid to ye winds, that they ſhould ſo get them gone: that neither ruſhing awaie with too much haſte, nor with too much ſlownes, ſtaying on the Seas too long, they ſhould not hurt or indomage the Troyan ſhips. The Emperour Charles the fift vſed to ſay, that the affaires of Princes, did conſiſt in two things: in counſell and execution.Sanſouinus de dictis &amp; fac. Imprat. Car. 5. Whereof the firſt required good iudgment, but the latter, great fidelitie: and that ſlownes was the ſoule of counſell, and haſte the ſoule of execution: and that both of thē together, were the Quinteſſence of wiſe Princes. And that counſell required a ſinguler wit and rare iudgment, and the putting of matters in execution, demaunded fit oportunitie, with occaſion proportionable, and much fidelitie.
               5 It chanceth verie ſeldome, that both wit to diſcourſe of thoſe things which are in counſell, &amp; iudgment to put the ſame in execution which is decréed, doo both together concurre in one perſon. Captaine Picinino was of verie weak &amp; ſmal iudgmentGarim prob. 99. in counſelling, but verie readie in executing of thoſe things which in the counſels were determined: and ſeemed rather to be caried with force and furie, then moued by reaſon or iudgment. He was alſo moſt fortunate in all things which he tooke in hand. Frauncis the firſt of that name, king of Fraunce, in counſailing went beyond all his Counſellers, eſpecially in matters touching warre: but in executing was nothing comparable vnto them. Clement the ſeuenth Pope, excéeded euerie one in counſel, but in execution was inferior to al thoſe that were of his Counſell. The holie Scripture mentioneth, that king Dauid

and that he was faire, and that God fauoured him. To be able to diſcourſe well vpon matters which are in counſell, and not to know how to put the ſame in execution, procéedeth from a braue wit, but ſimple wiſedom. And execution without counſellGarim. prob. 99. or iudgment, commeth of great wiſedom and ſmal wit: becauſe he that putteth any thing in execution, ought to be indued with ſinguler wiſedom, to execute the ſame wel which is determined. There haue béene manie Princes, who (as I haue written more at large in the Treatiſe which I intituled, Of the inſtitution of Princes.) were verie apt and wittie, in all Artes and Sciences, but yet of ſmall iudgment in gouerning their kingdoms: and albeit they were verie ingenious and prompt, yet were they nothing wiſe. And many becauſe they cannot tell how to reſolue thēſelues in ſuch things as they conſult vppon: they conclude not, but (as Cornelius Tacitus ſaith)Lib. 5. con

               7 They that conſult vpon anie matter, muſt put that counſellFranciſcus Lotimus. Conſiderat. 319. in execution, which ſeemeth to be leſſe dangerous, and to haue fewer inconueniences: for it is well néere a thing impoſſible, to be deliuered from all the inconueniences and dangers which hap to fall out in the execution of matters, and eſpeciallie in great enterpriſes. And therfore it is commonly ſaid, thatCornelius Tacit. Lib. 18. Publius Mimius: nunquam periculum ſine periculo vincitur. he that ventureth not, neither looſeth nor winneth. And one danger is ſaued by the other, and after the danger commeth the profit. If any man thinke that he can put anie thing which in counſell is concluded, in execution without aduenture, he ſhall neuer be able to bring that to paſſe which he wiſheth. For it is the propertie of Fortune, to croſſe, not onelie great and heroicall enterpriſes, but alſo ſmall and particular things. They ought not then to linger, but ſtraight-waies to put the ſame which in the counſell is concluded, in practiſe, though there be danger in the execution of it: if ſo be that the profit which is to folow the execution, be greater then the danger which is incurred in not executing it.
               8 It is the propertie of wiſe men, to conſult vpon all matters which they take in hand, with great deliberation: andSaluſt in Catelin. then (as Saluſt ſaith) ſpéedilie with a proportioned diligence, to execute the ſame which is concluded: and not imitate yt which is ſaid of the Maquedana, who ſpake without conſideration of the time and place, where and with whom ſhe ſpake. Therefore it is conuenient to conſider well of euery thing: for by how much the more things be déepelie pondered, by ſo much the more profitable are the counſels vnto the Common wealth, not onely in matters of peace, but alſo of war. And therfore in ancientPolidorus Virgilius in adagiis. times paſt, it was wont to be ſaid, that the Romaines did ouercome ſitting: and that counſell is taken on the pillow, and that many counſels amend all matters.
               9 It falleth out very ſildome, that they which haue determined to doo any thing, leaue and giue ouer the dooing of it,Prouerb. 11. though the execution thereof be difficult and dangerous: and

manie becauſe they would not be hindered, and kept from putting the ſame in execution which they purpoſe to doe, wil aſke no aduiſe, nor admit any one to counſell them: who (as they know) will not allow that which they will haue. For it ſeemethLotimus conſiderat. 330. vnto them, that their minds that ſhould helpe them to execute the ſame which they pretend, ſaint: and they feare, that if they ſhould conſult with them, vpon that which they haue before alreadie determined, it would be an occaſion to thē, not to execute the ſame which they wiſh. Such men are very hurtful vnto the Common-wealth. And if that before they had determined with themſelues to folow theyr pretences, they had conſulted vpon that which they ought to doe: they might eaſily be brought from dooing that, which they pretended: daſhing (as the royall Prophet ſaith) the children of Babilon on the ſtones, not ſuffering naughty and peruerſe pretences to grow. Theſe be the children of Babilon, which the kingly Prophet ſaith, thatPſalme. 136. they ought to be broken on the ſtone. The ſtone whereon they ſhould be broken, is our Redéemer and Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whoſe fauour and grace, all naughtie and wicked imaginations are broken.
               10 After that the ſame is begun to be executed, which inLotimus conſiderat. 331. the counſell was determined, the Counſellers muſt not remember or think of that counſell, which they forſooke, that the execution of the ſame be not hindered, which is already determined. For they muſt hold that firme and ſtable, which in counſell is agréed vpon, and thinke it to be moſt profitable to the Common-wealth: for it is very hurtfull to the execution, to thinke that thoſe counſels which they would not folow, were better then thoſe which they approoued. And indéed it is the propertie of vnfortunate perſons, (as Cornelius Tacitus ſaith)Cornelius Tacitus. Lib. 1. to thinke that, that counſell which they folowed not, was better and ſafer then that which they alowed and approoued.
               11 When the matters which are in counſell, are of ſuch condition and qualitie, that they may be redreſſed at all times, then may the Counſellers ſpend much time in deliberating what may be doone: for that thing is not ſaid to be doone out of time, which may be doone in any time. But contrariwiſe, if the matters require haſt, and a ſpéedie concluſion, then ought the Counſellers to make much of the time, and with as great

celeritie and ſpéed as may be, conclude and determine. For it is very hurtfull to thoſe things which the Counſellers ſit vpon,Lucan. Lib. 1. Cor. Tacitus. Liber. 17. to waſt time: and ſit long in conſultation, when the danger is at hand. For whilſt the Counſellers are conſulting what is to be doone, the occaſion paſſeth which was offered, to put the ſame in execution which was determined. Titus Liuius ſaith,Dec. 3. lib. 3. that in meane ſpace, while the Romaines conſulted what ſuccor they ſhould ſend, to the Towne Saguntia beeing beſieged with Hanibals Armie: it might haue béene taken, deſtroied, and raſed to the ground. And in a certaine Cittie in Spaine, whilſt they were long conſulting, what ſuper-ſcription they ſhould write on a Letter, which they ſent vnto thoſe of whō they aſked aide: the Cittie was taken by the enemies, and ſpoyled. In ancientFraſmus in adag
                        •
                     s. times paſt, the Image of opportunitie was ſet vp in many places, that men might remember to let no occaſion ſlip, which might be to their commoditie when opportunitie was offered. And that all men might vnderſtand, of how great importance it was, to let occaſion paſſe, they painted her on a whéele, becauſe ſhe neuer ſtandeth ſtill, nor remaineth in one place, with wings on her féete, becauſe ſhe paſſeth away ſwiftly, her face couered with the haire of her fore-head, becauſe ſhe lets none know her, but ſuch as be verie attentine to looke on her: with a raſer in her hande, becauſe ſhee cuts of their hope that take no heede of her but let her paſſe: with the hinder part of her head balde, becauſe if ſhe once be gone, no man can catth hold on her, and with a Maid that waits vpon her which is called Poenitentia, for repentance doth accompanie them that cannot tell how to reape profit by occaſion. This which we ſay of execution holds, vnleſſe the matters are ſuch as require no haſt, but may rather be delaid without danger then done. For in the diſpatch of them, they may be done with deliberation, &amp; though they be deferred, yet they may be doone to good purpoſe: andHernam. de Pulga. Epiſt. 2. therefore in ſuch things much is doone, though ſome thing be left vndoone. For time it ſelfe healeth many diſeaſes without any medicines, whereas the Phiſition with a medicine often times cannot. And many things in mans life are mard, not for that they ought not to be doone, but becauſe they be not doone inAntonius de Gauara. 1. part. Epiſtol. time and place. Therefore euery thing ſhould be throughly ſifted, that in due ſeaſon it may be diſpatched, as the Garden

               12 They therfore that giue not their reſolutions in euery thing at the firſt, are not to be found fault with all, if the matrers which are in conſultation be harde &amp; difficult and require long deliberation. But if they deferre their reſolution, becauſe they will not aduenture a little, to obtaine a great deale, or becauſe by the ſharpnes of their wits, they can alledge and bring reaſons to contrarie euerie thing that is propoſed: then mayFranciſcus Lotinus 336. conſideratione. they wel be blamed: for ſuch fellowes wil neuer conclude, vnleſſe they be forced vnto it.

               2 For Princes looſe not their authoritie at all, in folowing that which their Counſellers aduiſe them, but rather increaſe and augment it: for if Counſellers deminiſhed it, then would no Princes haue any Counſellers, of whom they might learne what were moſt profitable for ye Common-wealth. In the war which the Grecians waged againſt the Troyans, the counſels of Neſtor and Vliſſes, were farre more profitable then the forces of Achilles and Aiax: as Agamemnon ſhewed, when he ſayd, that if he had had tenne Neſtors to haue giuen him counſel, the ſiege of Troy ſhould not haue continued ſo long. Henrie ye thirdGariuai. lib. 15. Capit. 4. of that name, king of Caſtile, ſaid: that the counſels of wiſe men, did the Princes more good then the Armes of valiant ſoldiers, Becauſe brauer and more notable acts are wrought by men of counſell then by Armes. He was alſo wont to alledge yt which Tullie ſaid, to this purpoſe: to wit, that the counſels of Solon
                  Lib. 1. Officio. had béene no leſſe profitable vnto the Cittie of Athens, then the victorie of Themiſſocles. Saluſt aſſirmeth; that counſell is notSaluſt in principio Catelin. onely profitable for the conſernation and maintenance of peace, but alſo for the atchiuing of victory: becauſe good counſel alway preuaileth much in warre.
               
                  3 And Princes to the ende they may be well counſelled, ſhould commaund their Counſellers to ſpeake freelie in theyr conſultations, and ſhew their minds what they thinke ought to be determined to doo the Common-wealth good. For (as Artabanus ſaid to king Xerxes) if there be not diuers minds andHerodorus. lib. 7. opinions in their conſultations, how can the Prince chooſe that which is beſt. After the ſame order as we know which is the better gold, by laying of one péece of gold to the other: euen ſo, comparing one counſell with the other, the Princes diſcerne which of them is moſt profitable for the Common-wealth. And (as Paulus de Caſtro ſaith) euen as perſumes, the better theyConſilio 13. lib. 1 Conſilio. be beaten, the ſweeter they ſmell: ſo likewiſe, the ſentences, minds, and opinions of Counſellers, the more they be debated and diſcuſſed, the ſurer and better they be. True it is, that the rareſt and greateſt wits, béeing of ſingular iudgment, are able to enter déeper into matters, then they that are not ſo wittie, but of the ſimple ſort. And they that are fullie experienced, can better diſcerne what is neceſſaire in euery matter, then they which haue no ſkill in it. Yet neuertheleſſe, it is the dutie of enerie wiſe man, to heare the minds of many, for one man onelie, cannot ſee and know all things. And oftentimes one of ſimpleSaepe eſt olitor opportuna loquutus. Lib. 3. de inſtitut. princip. learning and ſmall knowledge, aduiſeth a wiſer perſon, of ſuch things which he neuer did heare or ſée before. Dion ſaith, that a Prince ſéeth with as manie eyes, and heareth with as many eares, as he hath freends that counſell him ſincerelie.
               4 It is a thing very hurtfull to the Common-wealth, that the Counſellers before hand ſhould knowe their Princes inclination, for then they ſéeke all means poſſible how to find out reaſons, which may iuſtifie and prooue that which their King or Prince deſireth. And for this cauſe, of all hurtfull Counſellers,Franciſcus Sanſouinus. de dictis &amp; fact. Car. v. looper. learned men are moſt noyous to the Common-wealth, if they abuſe their learning. The Emperor Charles the fift, was wont to ſay, that it became Princes very well, to be accompanied with learned men: and that the ſocietie and vſe of learned men, was very expedient and profitable vnto vertuous Princes: and contrarilie, very dangerous and hurtful to wicked and lewde Princes. For to euevy thing which the Prince will doo, they find either n Law or an Hiſtory to allow and approoue the ſame. And if ſo be that the Prince be of weake iudgment, he

will not be able to determine and chooſe, what is moſt profitable to the Common-wealth. It is manifeſt, that the Emperor ſaid true, ſéeing that there neuer wanted men of great learning, who contrarie to all reaſon and iuſtice, iuſtified and approoued that which their Prince purpoſed and appointed to doo. As alſo the Emperors which perſecuted our Chriſtian Religion, wanted not learned Counſellers to allow and approoue their wicked enterpriſes. Vlpian the Lawyer, wrote the manner howLactantius Tirmianus lib. 5. cap. 10. they ſhould torment and puniſh the Chriſtians. Neither wanted the Emperor Frederick, &amp; the other Emperors which perſecutedBaldouinus ad edicta principium de Chriſtianis. the Catholicke Church, learned men to iuſtifie theyr pretences, though they were vniuſt and erronious. Moreouer, many learned men did iuſtifie vnto Don Pedro king of Caſtile, that he might marrie with Ladie Marie of Caſtro, though notwithſtandingMarſilius Patauinus &amp; alii quibus reſpondit Albertus Tigurius lib. Hierar. Eccleſiaſt. his lawfull wife and Quéene, Ladie Blanch was yet liuing. Such Counſellers are not to be termed Iuriſperiti, and Juriſconſulti, but rather Jureperditi, and Iureſtulti. Certes, they that glorie, and vant that they be Chriſtians, ought to be aſhamed to doe that which Papinian being a Pagan would notCagnolus in procemio digaſtorum, 9, Itaque. in 131. doe, although he was commaunded by the Emperor Caracalla, (whoſe Steward and familiar he was) to doo it: which was, to defend an vniuſt cauſe. Wherefore by the Emperours commaund, he was ſlaine and put to death. Rather would he die,Aelius Spattianꝰ in vita Antoni. (though he was not a Chriſtian) then defend an vniuſt cauſe. And he eſteemed more (as our Lord and Sauiour Chriſt JeſusMatth. 10. teacheth vs) not to offend God, then he did of thoſe that kil the bodie, but not the ſoule. Thoſe learned men that iuſtifie falſe things vnto their Princes, diſcharge not their dueties as they are bound to doe: for they perſwade them to doo many thinges that redound to the Common-wealths vtter deſtruction.
               5 A Prince then ought to ſelect ſuch Counſellers, as doe not approoue all that which be ſaith: for that is the cheefe and principall tricke of flatterie, to allow all that is ſaid, and ſtill to ſing, Et cum ſpiritu tuo.

                     orum! becauſe their ſinne is deadlie, in deceiuing their Princes with flatterie: counterfeyting and maſking thoſe counſails which

they giue, with a falſe ſhew of Religion and iuſtice, regarding more their owne particular profit, then the common welfare. Theſe counſels haue no iuſtice at all in them, but onely the name of iuſtice, which they giue them to colour and maſke the vniuſtice and wickednes which in them lurketh. And when ſuch Counſellers come with ſhew of iuſtice and Religion, the harme which they doe vnto the Common-wealth, cannot be repaired: becauſe in their owne defence they make a ſhew of iuſtice, with which otherwiſe they might haue béene ſuppreſſed.Capi. 4. de inre in

                     ando. Theſe are rather (as Innocentius the third Pope ſaith) coſenners then Counſellers of Princes.
               6 That Counſellers may freelie ſpeake their mindes in their conſultations, Princes ought to imitate the Emperour Auguſtus Caeſar, who (as Seneca ſaith) béeing deſired by Tacitus
                  Lib. 1. de Clementia. cap. 16. to come to his houſe, to iudge of the offence which one of his Sonnes had committed, did as Tacitus requeſted him: and becauſe he ſhould not mooue them that ſhold heare the matter debated to folow that which he ſaid, and ſay as Princes Counſellers commonly doo, Et cum ſpiritu tuo: he commaunded that euerie one that was to determine of the matter, ſhould ſet down his mind in writing, and when as euery man had ſaid what he thought beſt to be doone, the Emperour told them his opinion and liking. The Emperor Caeſar Auguſtus neuer aſked hysSuetonius Tran. in vita Auguſti. Counſellers after the order as they ſate, but here one, and there another, that they ſhould all of them be attentiue and readie to anſwer, and ſhew their mindes what they thought was to be done, without addicting themſelues vnto that which the others ſaid. In ancient times paſt, when they propoſed Lawes vnto the people of Rome, concerning the Common-wealth: they beganDion. Lib. 3. to propoſe the ordinances to them which bare no Offices, to the end that they might boldly ſhew their minds, what they thought to be moſt profitable to the Common-wealth: and not kéep back their opinions, for feare leaſt they ſhould offend thoſe that bare office in the Common-wealth, if they earſt had ſaid to the contrary.

               The fourth diſcourſe, what counſels are expedient for the gouernment of a Common-wealth that is well inſtituted.
               
                  THE counſels are the foundation, whereon all Common-wealths be grounded. For whatſoeuer is conuenient to be doone for the profit of the Common-wealth, is decided in them. And according to Ariſtotle, there be fiue counſels which euerieRhet. lib. 1. Common-wealth that is well gouerned ought to haue. The firſt is of reuenewes: in this counſell they conſult vpon rents, as well ordinary as extraordinarie: and vpon ſuperfluous expences, how the rents are ſpent and conſumed. This counſell is very neceſſarie in a Common-wealth, for ſubſtance is the Quinteſſence as wel in publike as priuate affaires, without which, neither men nor Common-wealths can fitly be maintained. For little profit the foure Elements, and al other mixtures whatſoeuer, if men haue not wherwithal to buy ſuch things, as are neceſſarie to their maintenance and ſuſtentation: as I wrote more at large, in the Treatiſe which I made, of the crafts and fetches wherwith men attaine to riches. The ſecond counſell is of peace: and this commonly is called the counſell of eſtate, on which the whole gouernment of the Common-wealth is grounded: as I write more at large beneath. The third counſell is of warre: vnto this counſell it belongeth to looke to the fortifying of places, and maintenance of men, and what Souldiers are neceſſary for warres, and the defence of the Common-wealth, and manie other matters concerning the ſame. The fourth counſell is, of ſuch prouiſion and mayntenaunce as is neceſſary to the Common-wealth. This hath charge to prouide &amp; furniſh the Common-wealth, with maintenance and other thinges neceſſarie to life, in time of peace or warre. The fift counſell is for the Lawes and iuſtice. In this counſell all things are handled that pertaine and belong to the Prince, as well in ciuill as in criminall matters: that ye ſame may be there determined, which the Prince according to rightIn tractatu de conſilio &amp; conſiliariis principum. and iuſtice, (if he were preſent) ſhould ordaine by what order of iuſtice ſoeuer. Fredericus Furius calleth this the counſell of puniſhments: vnto this is that referred which is determined

in the Chaunceries: if the parties pleading complaine, that the Judges of the Chaunceries doo not iudge well and conformable vnto iuſtice. To which alſo, it belongeth to haue a regard, what Offices, charges, Magiſtrates and Gouernours are neceſſary for the gouernment of the Common-wealth: and what, and how much authority and power they ought to haue: this counſell ſhall adde ſuch Officers as are wanting, and put downe ſuch as are ſuperfluous. It pertaineth alſo vnto this, to declare and expound ſuch Lawes as haue a doubtful ſence, and take away ſuch as are hurtfull to the Common-wealth, and make ſuch newe as are neceſſarie.
               2 Unto theſe fiue counſels which Ariſtotle ſets down, Fredericus Furius addeth the ſixth: of gifts and rewards. This counſell hath charge to heare, and learne, the merits &amp; deſerts generally of all: béeing enformed of the life, manners, and abilitie and déeds of thoſe, that not aſking any reward, deſerue to be rewarded for their vertues. And particularly of thoſe that aſke ſome rewards. A reward is properly called that, which is giuen to doo good vnto him to whom it is giuen. For that which is giuen, to get and obtaine ſome thing of him, vnto whom itSeneca lib. 1. de benefici. cap. 6. is giuen, is not properlie a reward, but a contract or bargaine: ſéeing it is betwéene two parties that haue to doo with debt and receit. And ſuch reward, is rather to be ſet in reckoning bookes, which Merchants call bookes of account, then in the booke of rewards. The Common-wealth that is well gouerned, hath great néede of this counſell of rewards: that each one may labour and doo his beſt, to conſerue and augment it: for the reward inticeth, and ſtirreth vp men to labour, whereas no man (as Saluſt ſaith) wold be good, if he hoped not for ſome reward.Nemo gratis bonus eſt. King Nabuchadnezzor had bookes, in which he commaunded the ſeruice that was doone him to be written, to reward them that ſerued him.
               3 Although Ariſtotle and Fredericus Furius ſet down the counſels which are neceſſarie in a Common-wealth, after that order as we haue ſaid: yet it ſéemeth that the principall counſell, and on which the Common-wealth doth chéefly depend, is the counſell of eſtate. For in that counſell, that, is appointed and ordayned, which is to be doone in all the other counſels. This did the Senate of Rome commend vnto the Conſuls, that

they ſhould haue a regard that the Common-wealth ſhold take no harme. The power which the Dictator had, differed from the power which was giuen to the Conſuls: in this, that the Dictator, was ſuperiour to all the Magiſtrates, and as long asSaluſt in Catelin Videant Conſules, nequid detrimenti reſpub. capiat: et poteſtas per Senatum more Romano magiſtratui max ima permittitur. his dictatorſhip continued, he was abſolute King. But the Conſuls could not commaund any Cittizen to be put to death, vnleſſe the Senate approued it. Beſides alſo theſe counſels, which Ariſtotle and Fredericus Furius ſet downe, two others are neceſſarie to haue the Common-wealth well gouerned. The one of Cenſure or Manners, as the Romaines had, that none might be ſuffered in the Common-wealth to offend publiquelie, and ſo diſquiet and ſlaunder her: and that all ſuch as doo commit anie offence openly, might not remaine vnpuniſhed: as I wrote more at large in the Treatiſe of decrées concerning manners. The other of Religion, or Inquiſition: for no Common-welth can be maintained or augmented, if there be not a ſpeciall regard of Religion and worſhipping of God had in it, to maintain and uphold it: as I ſhew more at large in the ſmall diſcourſe of this booke.
               4 All theſe Counſels are reduced (as Phillippus de la Torre ſaith) vnto flue: viz. The firſt, vnto the counſell of warre.Cap. 9. de Inſtitutione Chriſtiani principis. The ſecond, vnto the counſell of iuſtice. The third, vnto the counſell of eſtate. The fourth, vnto the counſell of mechanicall or handicrafts Officers: and the fift, to the counſell of Religion. This is gathered out of that, which the Prophet Eſay ſaith: That God might puniſh the people of Iſrael for the ſins which they committed, by taking away the valiant and hardie men, that are experienced in matters concerning warre: the Judges that miniſter iuſtice: the Prophets and Elders, that haue authoritie to giue counſell: the handicrafts men, that are ſkilfull in that which they profeſſe: and the learned men that can declare the miſteries of God. In this, God ſheweth vnto vs, how neceſſary theſe coūſels are to euery Common-wealth. For if they haue not theſe counſels, &amp; be not gouerned as they ought, great confuſion and diſcord muſt neceſſarily folow after. It is therefore required, that the Counſellers of Princes, vſe all the diligence they poſſibly can, in looking to the publique and common profit: ſéeing that they be the verie gates and doores, through which all good &amp; ill entereth into the Common-wealth.
            
            
               
               The fift diſcourſe, how that in all Counſels, the meanes and ends of thoſe things which are in counſell, ought to be required and examined.
               
                  IN all Counſels (as Ariſtotle ſaith) ought notRhet. Lib. 1. onely to be examined and enquired, whither that which is in conſultation, be neceſſary and profitable to the Common-wealth: but alſo the means and ends of that which is in deliberation ought to be conſidered. The meanes are the waies, by which yt which in the counſels is determined, may and ought to be put in execution. The end is, that which chéeflie is inquired and ſought: if the meanes be naught, the counſell muſt be naught: if they be good, the counſell is good alſo. The Greekes call good counſellLib. 6. Moral.

                  Ariſtotle dooth finelie handle, and Celius Rodiginus declare, wherein 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   doth differ from ſcience, opinion, and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   which is to diuine and coniecture out of hand what may be doone, without ſpending much time in diſcourſing vpon that which is conſulted. But I meane not heare to repeate it, ſeeing that ſuch ſubtilties are fitter to be diſputed of in Schooles, then to be treated of, in counſels of Princes.
               2 Thoſe counſels are naught, in which is conſulted, howe to bring wicked and vnlawfull things to paſſe: and thoſe are bad counſels alſo, in which vnlawfull meanes are ſought, to put that in practiſe which is lawfull and honeſt. Therfore it is méet and conuenient, that they who deliberate and conſult vpon matters, doo enquire, not onely whether the beginning and meanes, wherwith they will accompliſh that which in ye counſell is determined, but alſo, whether the end of it be good and lawfull. Folowing this rule: they that goe about ſome matter, which of it ſelfe is contentious and ſlaunderous, ought not to regard the preſent occaſion which is offered to aduaunce it, but to conſider, whether the ende be like to be good or naught. Beſides, they ought not to allow anie bad and diſhoneſt thing, though of it come good and lawfull things. According to that, Non ſunt procuranda mala, vt eueniant bona. King Salomon ſayth:Eccleſiaſt. 19. That he that is haſtie to giue credit, is lightly minded, and ſhal

neuer proſper. For he that raſhly takes a thing in hand, before he haue throughly conſidered it, is an enemie to good counſell. The glorious Apoſtle S. Iohn, doth exhort vs, that we ſhould not beléeue euery ſpirit, nor be mooued with euery winde: but1. Iohn. 4. try the ſpirit whether it be of God. This is known eyther by the end vnto which it tendeth, or by the meanes by which it is aduaunced, or by the affections which mooue vs to doo it. If it be cléere, that neither the glory of God, nor the edifying of theDempſt. Epiſt. 1. Praeferri debet conſilium quod cum Dei voluntate congruit. holy Catholicke Church, nor the ſpirituall profit of our next Neighbor, but ſome humane pretence be in it reſpected and regarded: then is it not the counſell of God, ſéeing it is not directed vnto the ſeruice of the Lord. For (as Saint Ierome ſaith) that voice that perſwadeth any thing that offendeth God, is theSuper. Math. 4. voice of the deuill. As it is ſéene by the temptations wherwith he tempted our Redéemer &amp; Lord Jeſus Chriſt in the Deſerts, ſaying: that he ſhould worſhippe him, and caſt himſelfe downe from the Pinacle. But the voice of God is that, which encourageth and perſwadeth vs to the ſame which he commaundeth vs.
               3 Although ſometimes thoſe things, which with great prudence are deliberated and conſulted vpon, and in which lawful meanes are vſed to put them in practiſe, haue not the ſame ſucceſſe and euent which was hoped for, (for the counſails of Fortune as Latinus Paccatus ſaith, are very ſecrete: or rather, to ſay better, becauſe the iudgments of God as S. Paule ſayth: are vnſearchable, &amp; no man knoweth nor vnderſtandeth them.)Roma. 11. Pſalme. 35. Yet many things happen well which neuer were had in counſell: and though they are practiſed by naughty meanes, yet the euent and end of them is good. As Atheneus ſaith of the Athenians: whoſe counſels and iudgments, voide of al prudence and wiſedome, fell out very proſperouſly vnto them: and they ouercame their enemies, making election of Captaines for the warres, which no man would chooſe to make readie a banquet. Good counſell (as Artabanus ſaid to King Xerxes) is not to beHe
                        •
                     odot. lib. 7. leſſe valued and eſtéemed, though it be ouercome by Fortune: wheras contrariwiſe, though ill counſell haue good ſucceſſe, yet doth the counſell remaine ill. When Phocion ſawe that the matter fell out contrary to that which he had counſailed, he ſaidEraſmus in Apothek

                     a. that he was hartily glad, that it happened well, but that hys

counſell was neuer theleſſe very good. Giuing thereby to underſtand, that for a matter to fall out well, is but a chance, but to counſell well, commeth by reaſon that he who giueth the counſell, is endued with iudgment and wiſedome.
               4 Wiſe men ought not to truſt to the proſperous ſucceſſe of things: for Fortune often fauoureth (as Valerius Maximꝰ

The diuine prouidence (as Boaetius ſaith) to the greater puniſhment &amp; miſery of men, ſuffereth counſels commonly to be iudged of, according as they ſpéede, and that the counſels of the prudent be not beléeued, as it chanced vnto Achitophel wt 
                  Abſolon. Theſe, ſay the Greekes, are croſſed with the deſtiny of Caſſandra, in yt they be neuer beléeued when they counſell. There be many examples of wiſe men, who if they had béen beléeued, many publique and priuate harmes and dangers, might haue béen ſhunned: which becauſe I haue ſet downe in my booke of craftie and prudent counſails, I meane not to repeat. GOD doth oftentimes permit (as Boaetius ſaith) that their affayres that doo account themſelues very wiſe, happen quite contrarie to their imagination, to the end that they may vnderſtand and

know, that all thinges muſt fall out according to his pleaſure. For except the Lord kéepe the Cittie (as the kinglie Prophet ſaith) the Kéeper watcheth in vaine. And oftentimes humansPſalm. 126. prudence ſerueth them that thinke themſelues to be wiſe, to no other vſe, than to perceiue the miſeries and calamities, which they neither can nor know how to remedie, neither when they chance, nor yet before or after they happen: that the miſ-fortunes may haue, (as the prouerbe in Spayne is vſed) Byſperas y octauas.
               
            
            
               The ſixt diſcourſe, what qualities Counſellers ought to haue.
               
                  THE qualities which king Salomon wold haue Counſellers to haue, are theſe: The firſt, thatEccleſiaſt. 18. they ſhould be prudent, not raſh and headdie, as following their owne fancie, for ſuch men thinke nothing to be well, but that which they like: and for this cauſe no man ought to haue conference with an impatient or furious mā about any ſecrets, no nor yet truſt him with anie thing yt is ſecrete, for ſuch a one in giuing counſell, is obſtmate, and in ſecrets, wide-mouthed. To be wiſe, conſiſteth in conſideration both of things paſt, and of things to come, and (as Seneca ſaith) he that is prudent, conſiderethIn libro. 4. Virtut. that which may folow afterward, diſpoſeth that which is preſent, fore-ſeeth that which is to come, and remembreth that which is paſt: and if he forget that which is paſt, he looſethAriſto. lib. 1. cap. 8. magn. moral. his life: and if he thinke not of that which is to come, he falleth vnawares into many dangers. Therefore Prudence is calledDiſcretio mater eſt omnium virtutum. Ariſto. Eth. Libro. 6. the guide and mother of all other vertues: and as (Ariſtotle ſaith, Rectarerum agibilium ratio: that is to ſay, the ſtraight and ready rule of all things that may be doone. Without her, no man can counſell well, and ſhe is the moſt excellent &amp; ſureſt path to heauen. Prudence is diuided into fiue parts: which are,Seneca. lib. 9. Epiſtl. 68. Seneca. lib. 1. Epiſtol. 86. 
                  Prudentia particularis, which concerneth euery particular man. Prudentia Oeconomica, which belongeth to houſe-keeping. Prudentia politica, which pertaineth to the gouernment of Citties and Common-weales. Prudentia quae in ratione regendi eſt ſita, which belongeth to Kings, and to the gouernment of Realmes.

And Prudentia militaris, touching warlike policie, as Antoninus
                  Anton. in ſum. part. 4. tit. cap. 14 the Biſhop of Florence declareth. All theſe kinds of prudence, as much as they concerne counſelling, conſiſt: Firſt in fore-caſting the end of that which is conſulted, after that orderIodoc. Clichtouc' in Introduc. tionc. Iacob. Fabii. in Ethic. Ariſt. as he that trauaileth, fore-caſteth the place whether he is going. Secondlie, in ſéeking out means, how to attaine to the end of that which is conſulted: as a trauailer enquireth the way to the place whether he trauaileth. Thirdly, in chooſing out the beſt, among all the meanes which he findeth: and in picking out that in which there is leaſt danger. As for example, if ſome King conſulted to conclude vpon peace with his enemie, whether it were beſt to doo it, by rendering of ſome place or Cittie in his Realme, or by paying money, or by way of marriage: euen as he that trauaileth, when he commeth to a place where be many waies, taketh the beſt. Fourthly, in conſidering how to execute the ſame which is determined in the counſell, with leſſe trouble and charges: as he that taketh a iourney in hand, prouideth for that which he ſhall haue néed of by the way.
               2 The ſecond qualitie which King Salomon would haueEccleſiaſt. 21. Counſellers for to haue, is that they ſhould be wiſe: for the counſaile of the wiſe remaineth for euer, and is like a pureCapitulo. 4. Fountaine of life. Tobias counſelleth his ſonne, alwaies to demaund counſell of the wiſeſt: and that with great reaſon: for no doubt he that will doo all according to his owne liking, and without taking counſell of them that know more than himſelf, doth goe moſt aſtray.

Claudius Cottereus makes mention of certain Princes that gouernedVbi ſupra. their Common-wealths well by the counſell of wiſe men.
               3 The third qualitie that a Counſeller ought to haue, is age: that he be of ancient yeeres, becauſe olde men haue ſeene much. The Lawes of Statuts ſay, that in tract of time, prudence,Tit. 3. Lib. 2. in prolo. ſtatut. Politic. Lib. 5. Capitul. 8. In tractatu de conſtlio &amp; conſiliariis princip. authoritie, and experience of all thinges that are to be doone, is gotten. Ariſtotle ſaith, boyes are not able and ſufficient to giue counſell, becauſe their wit and iudgment beginneth to take force and vigour. Fredericus Furius will haue that the Counſellers of Princes be not vnder thirtie yeeres of age, nor aboue threeſcore, for from the thirtith yeere downwards, mens vnderſtanding is not yet ſetled, their experience is ſmall, their preſumption much, their heate great, their thoughts loſtie, their naturall weakenes much, neither can they keepe due grauitie: and beſides all this, the people truſteth them not, but murmureth againſt them. Let them lie at Schooles, let them trauaile to ſee Countries, manners and gouernments, let them learne tongues, let them folow the Campe and haunt the Court, let them take paines in learning: all ſuch thinges are conuenient to be knowne vnto the Counſeller of a Prince. Though young men commonly be not endewed with perfect iudgment, and for this cauſe the Law graunteth them the benefite Dereſtitutione

                  in integrum: the Lacedemonians would not admit them to ſit in publique counſell: neither came they to common places where Courts were kept, and the Senators aſſembled together: norPlutarchus in vita Licurgi. yet were they preſent in the Congregation of the Elders, tyll they were thirtie yeeres old: and what euer they had to doo in ſuch aſſemblies, they folowed it by their▪ Freendes and Kinſemen. Fredericus Furius denieth not, that many yong men haue better iudgment &amp; cleerer vnderſtanding then many olde men, and that the abilitie and wiſedome ought more to be regarded then the age. As may be ſeene by Papirius Praetextatus, vnto whom (being but a youth) it was granted, that he might were the garment, which men of full yeeres did were, and was calledAulus Gellius. Lib. 1. cap. 23 
                  Praetexta or togapraetexta, the Robe which the cheefe Officers and Senators wore. And this honor was doone vnto the

youth, becauſe comming with his Father into the Senate, he would not diſcouer and reueale thoſe matters, that he hearde there diſcuſſed.
               4 As touching olde men, Fredericus Furius would haue,Vbi ſupra. that thoſe which are aboue thréeſcore yéeres of age, ſhould returne home vnto their houſes, liue in reſt &amp; quietnes, diſcharge their conſciences, and thinke how they may die well. He wold alſo haue, that the Princes ſhould according to the cuſtome of Rome, giue them honors, priuiledges, preferments, preheminences, penſions, and rents, according to euery ones deſerts: as vnto them that are diſcharged from publique affaires, not admitting them to their counſels. For when they be once paſt the ſixtith yere, their memory faileth, their vnderſtanding wauereth, their experience turneth into ſtubbornnes and obſtinacie, their naturall heate is but little, and therefore they let occaſions ſlip béeing offered, their thoughts be wearied, they cannot trauel, and to conclude, ſuch men are an impediment and charge to the Court. But to returne to the purpoſe, ſéeing that the vertue and gift of counſelling well, commeth not from age, but from wit, iudgment, and wiſedom that euery one hath: we ought not ſo much to reſpect the age of men, as their abilitie, which is knowne by their words and déeds. For the words (as our Redéemer and Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſaith) repreſent yt whichLuke. 6. is in the hart. Socrates béeing aſked what he thought of a certaineEraſmus in Apothegma. 1. Co

                     . though old men be aboue thréeſcore yeres of age, yet want they not vnderſtanding, &amp; they be more wiſe then yong men. This Homer ſheweth, where he ſaith: that King Agamemnon wiſhed rather for tenne ancient men as Neſtor was, to be his Counſellers at the winning of Troy, then ten yong men like to Achilles. And that Agamemnon ſaid true, it is ſéene by the moſt excellent Don Hernando de Toledo, Duke Dalua, who in wiſedome &amp; experience of many affaires, ſupplied the turnes

               5 We may ſee how neceſſarie olde men are to giue counſell, by this that ye Lawes of Greece ordained: that thoſe ſhould be admitted to be Counſellers that were paſt fiftie yéeres of age. Solon ſeeing that the flatterie of Piſiſtratus, wherwith he abuſed the people of Athens, was openly diſcouered and known, to pretende no other thing then to vſurpe the Empire, and toPlutarch num ſeni gerenda ſit Reſpublica. bring the gouernment of the Common-wealth vnto the rule of one man, onely himſelfe: and that no man durſt take vppon him to reſiſt and hinder him: he himſelfe fetching his weapons out, and laying them in the ſtreete before his doore, called all the Citizens to helpe him. And Piſiſtratus ſending vnto him to know vpō what aſſurance he durſt be ſo bold to doo ſuch things, he aunſwered, vpon olde age: which alwaies is moſt readie to giue counſaile in matters of waight and importance. For it is frée (as Plato ſaith) from thoſe affections and paſſions, which trouble and moleſt youth. King Agis béeing in Archadia with his Armie, and readio to pitch the field with his enemies, there was an ancient Lacedemonian that cryed out a loude; that he ſhould conſider that one ſore, was not to be cured by another. Signifying by this, that he might haue gone away from the Argiues and ſaued himſelfe, without putting himſelfe to the worſt, by that his determined boldnes out of time and ſeaſon. Agis hearing this, did according to the olde mans words, and altering his minde, went from the Argiues, and afterward ouerc

               6▪ That men might vnderſtand, that to counſell wel, conſiſteth rather in the vigor of the mind, then in the forces of the bodie: in ancient times paſt, they painted the Image of Mercurie in the diſpoſition and forme of an old man, without hands and feete, his members béeing onely ſtretched out. For force, ſtrength, and thoſe parts that mooue the bodie, are nothing neceſſary, ſo that their reaſon and vnderſtanding be fruitfull and fertile.

               7 Euery Prince ought to conſider, that there happened much harme, &amp; great tumults aroſe among the Iſralites, becauſe Roboam their king, leauing the counſell of old and expert men in the gouernment of the Common-wealth, folowed the minds of young and vnſkilfull Counſellers. And ſtraight after that ouer-thwart counſell, followed the ſeperation of the twelue Tribes, the deuiſion of the people, the deſtruction of the Common-wealth of Iſraell, and contempt of God. Then began Idolatrie, and the condemnation of the tenne Tribes, for withdrawing themſelues from the vnion and true worſhipping of the Lord. All theſe heauie and greeuous harmes befel vnto Iſraell, becauſe the King knewe not what counſels he ſhould chooſe, and becauſe he would not ioyne with the counſell of the wiſeſt, and moſt experienced men, which in his dayes and with his owne eyes he ſaw.

We may behold how well king Pharao gouerned,Geneſis, 14, when Ioſeph was with him: and king Saul when he folowed the counſell of Samuel. And the king of Syria when he had Naaman

               8 The fourth qualitie which King Salomon would haue aEccleſiaſt. 30. Counſeller to haue, is, that when he counſelleth he ſhould not be ſorrowfull: for a troubled and greeued minde, drieth the bones (as king Salomon ſaith) and therefore much more theProuerb, 17. fleſh, and the blood. And a mans mind béeing vexed with gréefe, is obfuſcated and darkned with the paſſions which he ſuffereth, ſo that he cannot vnderſtande and iudge well of that which is counſelled. The people of Parthia, to ſhunne this inconuenience, did conſult of that they had to doo, in banquets. For ſorrow bindeth mans vnderſtanding, and for this cauſe this is vſed in Spayne for a common prouerbe: Mal ſe cura de ſuentura contriſtura: that is, ſorrow cannot launce away our miſchance. For after that ſome miſ-fortune is happened, all the ſorrowe that a man can haue will not remedie it.
               9 The fift qualitie is, that the counſell ought to be wellProuerb, 11. thought of, and as it is ſaid, vpon the pillow. For that counſellSeneca in Libro de benefi. velox conſilium ſequitur paenitentia. which is not well toſſed and tumbled in our minde, bringeth repentance with it: for the more matters are conſidered &amp; wayed, the better they be vnderſtood: and both haſte and anger, are contrarie to deliberation and conſultation.

And vnto this (as the reuerend Father Ludouicus Granatenſis ſaith) fiue things are neceſſarilie required. Firſt, to commit all matters vnto our Lord and Sauiour Chriſt Jeſus. Secondlie, to perpend them with great attention and diſcretion,

not onely marking the ſubſtance of the matter, but alſo conſidering all the circumſtances that belong vnto it. For if onely one thing be wanting, that one thing is ſufficient to marre all: and though it be throughly pondered, fully concluded, and altogether perfect: yet onely the dooing of it out of time, is inough to make a foule blemiſh in it. Thirdly, to take counſell. For thoſe things that are doone without counſell, very ſeld

For though it be profitable to heare the opinion and mindes of manie, to knowe the matter throughly: yet it ought to be committed but to ſewe, and thoſe very ſelect and choſen men, to be determined and concluded. For if there were too manie, they might eaſily erre by reaſon of the diuerſitie of opinions. Fourthly, to take time in deliberating vpon the matter, and let the counſaile ripen a few daies. For as by continuance of time we are better acquainted with mens manners, ſo are we alſo with counſels and determinations: and that which at the beginning liked vs very well, afterward beeing well conſidered, is altogether miſliked. Fiftly and laſtlie, to take heede of foure Mothers in Lawe which the vertue Prudence hath. Which are, ouermuch raſhnes, affection, obſtinacie or ſtifnes in opinion, and ſhewe of vanitie: for ouermuch raſhnes blindeth: obſtinacie, ſhutteth the doore againſt good counſaile: and ſhew of vanitie, doth ſoyle and ſpotte each thing that commeth neere it.

For no man will take the water which he meaneth to drinke, out of an vncleane veſſell.

And then he called vnto him thoſe that profeſſed themſelues to be his Friends, and told them each one a part in ſecrecie, that he had killed a man, and that he had him at home in his houſe, and bringing them vnto the Chamber where the Image was, he ſhewed it vnto them, requeſting them to fauour him ſo much, as to take away the dead body and to hide it in their houſes: that if he had béene ſuſpected for killing of the man, and the Officers had come to make ſearch for the dead bodie, it might not be found in his houſe: but they all excuſed themſelues, and refuſed to do that which Alcibiades requeſted of them▪ fearing leaſt if the dead bodie had béen founde in their houſes, they ſhould haue béene brought in trouble, as acceſſaries in that offence vnto Alcibiades. Onely Callias ſaid vnto him, that he would take the dead body, and kéepe it ſecretlie in ſome part of his houſe, and that for his ſake, he would aduenture what danger ſoeuer. And from that time forward, Alcibiades tooke Callias for a right true Friende, and ſaid vnto him, that the ſame which he thought to be a deade bodie, was but an Image which he had commaunded to be made to try his friends. In aduerſitie, a man may eaſily know who be his true and loyall friends. Iulius Caeſar ſaid, that a mans friends becomeLibro.

               12 The eight qualitie that a Counſeller ought to haue, is,

to be faithfull in counſelling, &amp; not to counſell any thing whichEccleſiaſt. 27 is not good. Fredericus Furius ſaith, that a Prince may learnFredericus Furi▪ vb

As for example: if he would haue them to break ſome important Lawe, or to weaken and diminiſh the libertie of ſome Priuiledge: or to ordain ſome exceſſiue tributs or toles, or ſom ſuch other like things. And by their anſwer and determination, may he in ſome ſort gather howe they be affected towardes the Common-wealth.

Paul the third, Pope, vſed the ſame diligence, to knowe the affection and inclination of men, &amp; many times propoſed matters vnto his Cardinals, (no neceſſity at all vrging him vnto it) which might offer them occaſion to ſtriue and contend in opinions, and wylled them to tell him theyr mindes, and by their alteration, learned what anſwer he ſhould giue to the Embaſſadors that were ſent vnto him from other Countreyes.
               13 There are many other pollicies, whereby a PrinceFrederie▪ Furius vbi ſupra. Eraſm. in Panegir, ad Phil. Reg. may know whether his Counſellers reſpect theyr priuat commoditie more, then the welfare of the Common-wealth: for if there be any that be hypocrites and couetous perſons: if there be any that ſay all is the Kings, and that the King may doo hys will and pleaſure, or that the King may ordaine as many toles and tributes as he will, or that the King cannot doo amiſſe, or that all which the King will haue is a Lawe, and ought to be kept as a Law, or that a King is not bounde to giue account of

that which he commaundeth: all ſuch Coūſellers are enemies to the welfare of the Common-wealth, for the King neither ought, nor may doo any thing, that may doo the Common-welth any notable harme. No Prince yet euen vntil this preſent day, attained to great forces, and defended himſelfe there withall, but through meanes of men, that eſtéemed more the publique profit then their own priuat commoditie. And contrariwiſe, when-ſoeuer it ſhall happen that the Princes be counſelled of thoſe, that little regard the welfare of the Common-wealth, ſo they looſe nothing themſelues: euen at that time ſhall ye Princes begin to decay, and nothing ſhall be brought to effect, that may redound to the welfare and profit of the Common-welth. After that Solon had determined to moderate the debts whichPlutarch in vita Solon. the Cittie was owing, and to bring in an equalitie, which was a certaine diminution of the debts, and publique acquittaunce which was giuen to the Cittie, that no man might come and aſke that which was owing them there: he communicated his intent with ſome of his néere fréends.

               14 The ninth qualitie, that King Salomon ſaith a CounſellerProuerb, 1. ought to haue, is, to keepe cloſe and ſecret that which is conſulted, and not to diſcloſe or open it vnto any man. Seneca ſaith, that a Counſeller ought to talke much with himſelfe, but very little with others: for in ſpeaking much with others, he incurreth daunger to diſcloſe that which is in ſecrete. There is nothing that deſtroieth and ſpoileth all publique and priuat affayres more▪ then to haue that known, which is conſulted andIn 4. par. in ſermon. ad r

The great ſecrecie that is vſed among the 
                     Ʋenecians, may cléerely be ſeene, in that they being informed, that Carmignola their general CaptaineBartol. diſcuſs. S. Petrꝰ Iuſtinia. in hiſtor▪ venet. diſcharged not his Office according to his duetie, determined to ſende for him, as if they would haue communicated with him about certaine affaires touching the warre at that time: that after he was come, they might haue executed due puniſhment on him, according to that he had deſerued. Thys thing béeing concluded amongſt them, and determined in the Senate: was kept ſecrete eyght moneths long, whereas notwithſtanding, there were two hundred perſons preſent at the concluſion of the ſame matter. And though that Captaine had many friendes in Venice that fauoured him: yet was not thys counſell diſcloſed in all that ſpace. But Carmignola at yt length came to Venice, and was moſt honourablie receiued. But when he had béene preſented to the Senate, they ledde him fainedlie to a certaine place, as if he ſhould haue there reſted, where beeing come, he remained priſoner, &amp; after thirtie daies (in which ſpace they conſulted vpon his cauſe) they commaunded him to be beheaded with a gag in his mouth. Paulus Iouius ſaith, that they condemned him, to confiſcate and ſeiſe, as forfaite vnto them, three hundreth thouſande Duckets which he had: as I wrote more at large, in my Booke of the Office and duetie of the Captaine Generall. But to turne backe to our latter purpoſe.

               17 The tenth qualitie which king Salomon would haueEccleſiaſt. 37 a Counſeller to haue, is, that he be not enuious, or owe any man ill will: for how is it poſſible that he ſhold giue good counſell to a man, whom he hateth and cannot abide? Of the enuious, this prouerbe in Spayne is vſed:

                     Nor any neere him for to come
                     The ſame Horſe can abide.
                  
               
               for the conuerſation of the enuious is ſo contagious and infectious, that the Spanyards vſed this old ſaying,

Saluſt affirmeth, that all men that deliberate vpon doubtfull matters, ought not to be mooued with fréendſhip, anger or mercie: for in thoſe matters where they varie and contende, the minde can hardly perceiue the truth. Neither was there euer any one that did attend both his owne diſordered will, and the publique profit alſo, for whereunto a mans will is moſt enclined, to that doth his wit moſt apply it ſelfe: &amp; if the will ouercome, it ruleth, and reaſon hath no power: for the deſire that a man hath to attaine vnto that which he pretendeth, blindeth his vnderſtanding. And ſo doth feare alſo, (as Cornelius Tacitus affirmeth)Lib. 3. Pauidis conſilia incerta ſunt. ſo that fearefull men cannot gouerne well, nor counſell that which is profitable to the Common-wealth, for feare doth not let them iudge fréely. And as thoſe that ſtande by and ſée others play, can better iudge of the Game then they thatLotinus conſideratione, 326, play themſelues, for as the gaine which they that play hope to get by their game, blindeth them not: euen ſo they that iudge and counſell, ought to be frée from paſſions, which trouble the vnderſtanding, and ſuffereth it not to picke and chooſe out that which is beſt. When the Areopagites in Athens, aſſembled togetherQuintil. libro 6. cap. 1. to iudge, the Crier called vnto them with a loude voice, that they ſhould iudge without any reſpect of affection at all.

Car. v. ſhould lay aſide all diſſimulation, &amp; reſpects which might moue them, before they entred to conſult: that they might fréely vnderſtand &amp; iudge, what were moſt profitable for the Commonwealth. Plato writing vnto the freends of Dion, affirmeth, thatIn Epiſto. 7. they which vſe thēſelues to eate much, cannot be wiſe, though they be neuer ſo ingenious and wittie. King Salomon ſaith: AEccleſiaſt. 10. wofull kingdome is the ſame, where he that ruleth it is a child,

and the Princes that are with him, are belly-maiſters: or as ſome interpret it. Sorrowfull is that Countrey, where he that ruleth it is a childe, and they that gouerne it are drunkardes. The reaſon is, becauſe Gluttons and drunkards are not wiſe: and that (as Plutarch ſaith) they that accuſtome themſelues toIn vita Lycurgi. haue their bodies filled with meate, corrupt &amp; mar their iudgment in ſuch manner: that they are profitable, neither to gouerne the affaires of the Common-wealth, nor yet to doo any other good thing, but (euen as brute beaſtes) to looſe the vſe of reaſon, and abuſe the gifts of GOD, which ought to be taken with great deuotion and reuerence.
               
               
                  The qualities which Thucidites ſaid that a Counſeller ought to haue.
                  
                     
                        THucidites aſcribeth foure things vnto Counſellers, which they ought to haue, to be able to giueLotinus conſideratione, 343. good counſell in matters concerning the Common-wealth. The firſt is, that they vnderſtand1 that which is conſulted. For hardly can blindePlato in Phaedr. men (as Ariſtotle ſaith) iudge of coullours. Plato ſaith, that this is the moſt important thing that a Counſeller ought to haue. Socrates ſaid, that euery man was eloquent in the A
                        •
                     te which he knew. And king Salomon affirmeth, that euery man is ſkilfullEccleſiaſt. 38. in the Arte which he vnderſtandeth. The ſeconde qualitie2 which Thucidites ſaith that a Coūſeller ought to haue, is, that he be not ouercome, either with money which is giuen him, or promiſes which are made him. The third is, that he be able to3 propoſe the ſame, which he vnderſtandeth and knoweth to be profitable for the Common-wealth. For if he vnderſtand what is conuenient to be doone, and knoweth not howe to vtter it, it is as much as if he vnderſtood it not. Therfore all Counſellers of Princes, (as Fredericus Furius ſaith) ought to be well ſéeneVbi ſupra. in the Arte of Rhetorick, or Science of good vtterance. For euen as man differeth from all other liuing creatures, in vnderſtanding, and in the gift of ſpéech: ſo among men, they are accounted to be the moſt excellent and rareſt, that can reaſon and diſcourſe with moſt grace and iudgment.
                  The fourth qualitie is, that he be a greater fréende to the4
                     
Common-wealth. then to his own particular profit and reputation. In ſo much, that where he can doo the Common-wealth any good, or ſtand her in any ſtéed, he ought to imploy himſelfe with all power and diligence therein: though he ſhould incur great danger both of his credite, life and goods. O the vnhappie Common-wealths, that haue vnto their Counſellers ſuch men as Midas and Glaucus: for they in giuing counſell, neuer regarded the welfare of the Common-wealth, but only how they might themſelues attaine to great ſtore of riches, and augment their owne ſubſtance with the domage and loſſe of the Common-wealth. Theſe men (as Petrus Cremenſis ſaith) counſellIn rapſodia de recta reg

                        i adminiſtratione. and perſwade their Princes to ordaine newe tributes, to ſeiſe vpon their Subiects goods, and confiſcate the poſſeſſions and ſubſtaunce of their vaſſals: that they themſelues might enioy the profit and cōmodities of other mens goods. Therfore a goodFredericus Furius vbi ſupra. Counſeller, ought to robbe and pill himſelfe of all intereſt of fréendſhip, kindred, partialitie, faction, and all other reſpects whatſoeuer: and to decke, adorne, and apparrell himſelfe, with right and prudent veritie, which neither can nor will fauour any thing but iuſtice &amp; truth. And this ought euery good Counſeller to ſticke vnto, as to his friend, Coſin, faction, and commoditie: and to reſpect this and no other thing whatſoeuer. In ſo much that a Counſeller ought to be affected towards all men alike, without any difference at all, but in ſuch order, that he regard them moſt, that incline moſt vnto vertue. And to conclude, all Princes Counſellers, ought when they giue counſel, not to procure thereby any profit for their kinſemen &amp; fréendes, with the loſſe and hurt of the Common-wealth. But as Lucane ſaith:

                        Non ſibi, ſed toti genitum ſe credere mundo.
                     
                  
                  He ought to thinke, that he was not borne to doo for himſelfe onely, but alſo to further and helpe all men: and alwaies to haue a regarde of the wel-fare and commoditie of the whole Common-wealth.

                        ARiſtotle would haue, that all Counſellers ſhould be exerciſed in all ſuch vertues and points of iuſtice,Rhet. 1. which are neceſſary to be knowne of thoſe that conſult vpon matters, belonging to ye whole eſtate of the Common-wealth. He would alſo haue them to be wel practiſed both in gouernment of peace andFredericus Furius vbi ſupra. warre, and all other things thereto pertaining. For ſeeing that the office and duetie of a Prince conſiſteth in theſe two things, Gouernment &amp; Defence, bothe of them are referred vnto peace and warre.
                  The Romaines admitted vnto thoſe counſels which the SenatorsAulus Gelli▪ li. 3. cap. 18. noctium attic. gaue, vpon things belonging to the Common-wealth, ſome men that had borne honourable Offices in the Cittie: not that they ſhould ſhewe their mindes touching that which was conſulted, but that they ſhould folow thoſe whom they thought counſelled beſt: and becauſe they went towardes thoſe perſons whoſe ſentence they allowed, they were called Pedarii, thus doing, they ſpent not much time in counſelling. The Commonwealth of Rome, admitted no men vnto their counſels, but ſuch as had earſt béene preſent at many counſels. The Emperour Charles the fift ſaid, that that counſel which was giuen by loyallFran. San. de dic. &amp; fac. imp.

                  The ſecond thing which Ariſtotle doth require, in thoſe taht conſult vpon matters touching the Common-wealth, is wit to put the ſame in practiſe, which in counſell is determined: for

                        . execution which is concluded. And in this Ariſtotle agreeth with Thucidides. For whereas Thucidides requireth, that a Counſeller ſhould know howe to propoſe that which he in his minde conceiueth, it is to be noted, that he fitted himſelfe conformable to ye time in which he wrote. At which inſtant the Athenians lingred much time, in propoſing that in their counſels, which they thought to be moſt profitable to ye Common-welth, without any reſolution at all for the performing of any thing. For it is proper (as we haue ſaid) vnto the Democratia, or populer eſtate, not to grow to any reſolution in all their counſels, vnleſſe neceſſitie compell them to it. Therefore if they departMachiauellu

                        . out of the counſell, hauing concluded, it is more by chance, then by ſkill or wit. Demoſthenes affirmeth, that ye

The reaſon why in thoſe weales which are gouerned by the Common-people, they part without cōcluſion vnleſſe they be forced vnto it, is, becauſe their weakenes ſuffereth thē not to determine in thoſe thinges in which there is ſome doubt: and if they doo not (as it were) ouerthrow it with ſome violent on-ſet, they alwaies perplexed, hang in ſuſpence without determining.
                  18 Ariſtotle ſaith, that the facultie of the mind, in whichPolitic. libro 1. cap. 3. counſelling conſiſteth, is not perfect in bond-men, and alſo that it is but weake and ſmall in women. But this is to be taken generally and not particularly: for though it be moſt true, that ſeruitude doth oppreſſe the faculties of the mind, and that they be perfect in the ſame man when he is deliuered from bondage,Dialog. 6. de Reſpubli. (for as Plato and Homer ſaie, ſeruitude cauſeth a man to looſe his vnderſtanding) yet neuertheles, there be many bond-men that are endued with ſinguler and perfect wit: as may be ſéene in many counſels which diuers ſeruants haue giuen to theyr Lords: which I haue ſet down in my Booke of craftie and prudent counſels. Quintus Curtius ſaith, that it is ſafer and betterLibro, 7▪
                      for ſeruants to obey, then to counſell: for in counſelling, if the matter fall out contrarie, they incur danger, and in obeying they be faultleſſe howſoeuer matters fall out, for it is their dutie to obey and not to giue counſell: eſpecially if their Lordes

ſuſpect that ſeruants counſel them in matters concerning their own profit, little regarding that which is conuenient for theyrPerſius Mille hominum ſpecies. &amp;c. Lords. No man can deny, but that ſéeing mens wits are verie vnlike and diuers, ſome of them be purified in aduerſitie, as gold in the fire, (for vertue as S. Paule ſaith, is made perfect by aduerſitie,) and others contrarily, by miſaduenture and calamities1. Corin. 12. looſe theyr wit and vnderſtanding. And not onely men haue more iudgment and vnderſtanding when they be fauoured, then they haue béeing perſecuted and purſued: but alſo in brute beaſtes we may ſée the difference which they haue being much made of, and when they be miſliked of by their Lordes: yea and in one ſelfe ſame man if he fall into captiuity. For bondage and captiuitie doe ſo vexe and diſturbe their wits that are croſſed with miſ-fortune, that he which was frée being brought into ſeruitude, ſeemeth not to be the ſame man. The ciuill * Lawes determine, that fortune many times maketh themL. quod attinet. ff. de regulis iuris, quod attinet ad ius Ciuile ſeruj pro nullis habentur. bond-men, whom nature made frée, and maketh them frée whō nature made ſlaues and bond-men: but according to the lawe of nature, he that knoweth and vnderſtandeth leaſt, ought to ſerue and obey him that vnderſtandeth moſt. Plato, Diogines and Ioſeph, though they were brought in captiuitie and made bond-men, yet loſt they not their vnderſtanding. But rather (as S. Ierome ſaith) Plato, though he was a Captiue, yet was1. Epiſtol. ad. Paulinum. he greater then his Lorde that bought him, for he that bought him was an Idiot, and Plato was a Philoſopher. Diogenes when he was ledde to the market place for to be ſold, ſaid to the Crier that ſold him, that he ſhould cry whether any man would buy a Lord to rule and gouerne him. As I wrote more at large in the Treatiſe which I made of good education &amp; bringing vp of youth. Though the Lawes of nature commaunde, that ignoraunt and vnſkilfull men, ſhoulde obey and ſerue thoſe that are learned and ſkilfull, and they that can doo leſſe vnto them that can doe more: yet we ſée commonly, that cowards rule &amp; commaund valiant men: ignorant and vnſkilful men, haue the maſtrie ouer learned men: and vertuous and good men, are ſubiect to lewde and wicked perſons: as Appollonius Thianeus aunſwered, vnto one that aſked him what he had ſeene in trauailing through the world.
                  19 As concerning that which Ariſtotle ſaith of women:

that, that part of the mind in which the vertue of counſell conſiſteth,L. 1. verſ. viro

For they be commonly giuen to telling of newes, and chatting among their Goſſeps, of that which is committed vnto their ſecricle, althogh it be neuer ſo dangerous vnto thoſe that truſt them with theyrEraſm. in Apoth. counſell. Cato the greater ſaid, that he was hartily ſorrie, that he had euer diſcouered any ſecrete vnto a woman. Lactantius

But not to ſlide from the matter, we may obſerue, that, that which Ariſtotle ſayth of women, is not ſo generally to be taken, that it may be ſaid of all women without acception: for there haue béene, and nowe are many famous and renowned Noble women, whoſe counſels haue doone, and yet doo, the Common-wealth much good.Phil. Bargo. in lib. de illuſtrib. mulieribus. Caſsan. in Cata. Gloriae mundi, part. 2. conſi. 10. Pet. Rebuf. in concordantijs. As after Iohn Bocace, Phillip Bargomate, and Caſſaneus, I haue written in the Treatiſe of wiſe &amp; ſubtile counſels. They that make ſuch a generall rule touching womans wit and vnderſtanding, ſéeme not (as Peter Rebuffo ſaith) to addreſſe thē
                     ſelues vnto the parable in the Goſpell of the Math. 13. tenne Virgins, that fiue of them were wiſe, and fiue of them were fooles, neyther was the number of the fooles greater then the number of the wiſe. Out of that which we haue hetherto ſaid, is gathered, that to affirme that vniuerſally (as Ariſtotle doth) which ought to be verified and prooued particularly, is rather to take occaſion to diſpute and ſéeke reaſons to argue, then to ſhewe howe a man may know whither they that are to giue counſell, haue thoſe qualities which in Counſellers are required. For Counſellers for the moſt part, depend vpon the occaſions and circumſtances, and are as remedies that are applyed vnto diſeaſes, which are not cured in the abſtract, but in the ſubiect in which they be: (as Ariſtotle himſelfe ſaith) and the Counſellers beMedicina non curat hominem ſed Socratem. Auguſt. Epiſt. 5. ad Mercellium. Phiſitions, who in thoſe matters vpon which they doo conſult, ſéeke remedies to apply vnto them: and in the applicatiue (as they terme it) conſiſteth the profit which the medicines do. And for this cauſe it is ſaide, that the handes of the Phiſition and

Surgion, are oyntments. And as the applicatiue doth depende vpon the iudgment and ſkill that euery one hath: ſo in matters touching counſel, the abilitie which euery one hath, is to be conſidered. For (as Euſtachius ſaith) the generall and vniuerſall rules are not ſufficient enough, to haue each particular thing gouerned by them: and much leſſe Common-weales, in which commonly concurre many very diuers &amp; contrary circumſtances, which cannot be comprehended vnder the vniuerſal rules.
                  20 Fredericus Furius ſaith, that the Counſellers of PrincesVbi ſupra. ought to be ſkilfull in many things, but eſpeciallie in thoſe languages that are ſpoken in thoſe Prouinces that are vnder their Princes gouernment, or be their confederats or friends. For very ſeldome ſhal one méete with an Interpreter, that declareth and expoundeth the interpretation of a thing perfectlie, without wreſting, turning, taking away, adding, changing and altering the ſence, after many and diuers manners. It falleth out ſometimes, that there commeth a Spy, vpon whoſe relation, perchaunce the ſafetie and honor of the whole Realme dependeth, and which ſuffereth no delay, and then it is a great incōuenience at ſuch a pinch to ſéeke an Interpreter: for either none can be founde ſo ſoone, or though one be had, yet the Spye dareth not to tell it vnto ſuch a man, or the Interpreter may diſcouer it, or ſome ſuch other inconuenience may happen. How much this importeh, may be learned by Themiſtocles, who fléeingPlutarch in vita Themiſtoclis. from Greece to the King of Perſia, and béeing demaunded of the King to tell him what he would haue, anſwered, that ſpéech was like vnto painted and wrought Tapiſtrie: for as that béeing extended and ſpread abroad, dooth ſhewe the painted Images that are in it, and when it is folded vp it dooth couer &amp; hide them, euen ſo is it with ſpéech alſo. And therefore he deſired of the King, to grant him one yéeres ſpace, that he might in the mean time learne the Perſian tongue, which Themiſtocles did, becauſe he wold not ſhew his mind vnto the King by any third perſon. Phillip, who interpreted that which Atabalipa King of Cuſco anſwered, vnto yt which was aſked of him when he was accuſed, did play the Interpreter in ſuch ſort, that the king was condemned to die.

                  21 The Counſellers of Princes, ought to haue attentiuely read, both ancient and newe Hiſtories, throughly ſifting &amp; examiningFredericus Furius vbi ſupra. thē: but eſpecially al ſuch Hiſtories, as haue béen written of their owne Common-wealth, and of their confederates, neighbors and enemies. Ariſtotle counſelleth all thoſe that gouerne Common-welths, to giue thēſelues vnto continuall reading of Hiſtories, that occaſion béeing offered, they may know how to turne that to their profit, which in times paſt they haue read. Moreouer, Coūſellers of Princes, ought to know the end, matter and circumſtances, how, when, and how farre each vertue is extended. For by reaſon that this is not knowne, almoſt all men are miſcalled. He that loueth quietnes and ſhunneth quarrels and brawles, is termed a coward. He that is craftie, a Traytor. He that is rude and ruſticke, good. He that is dulheaded and blockiſh, milde &amp; gentle. He that ſtudieth not wittie and ſubtile Artes and Sciences, either for want of capacitie, or becauſe he will not take paines: is taken to be one that chooſeth the plaine and right way. He that is wrathful, haſtie, and furious, valiant and ſtrong. He that is prodigall, liberall. He that is couetous, thriftie, prouident, and circumſpect. He that is ſuperſtitious, holie. He that is learned, curious. And as Cato Vticenſis ſaid in an Oration which he pronounced in theSaluſt in Ca

                        lina. Senate houſe: it is long ſince we loſt the right names and titles of things, and by reaſon of that, neither Common-weales nor yet men, can be well ruled and gouerned. Furthermore,Vbi ſupra. Counſellers of Princes, (as Fredericus Furius ſaith) ought to haue

ſéene and viewed many ſtrange Coūtries, but aboue all others, thoſe that are belonging to their Princes, enemies and neighbours. And this their béeing abroad in farre Countries and vnknowne Kingdoms, ought to be circumſpect and prudent, not careles and negligent, as the voyages of idle and wandering perſons commonly be: not vnlike to men that walke through a Fayre onely to féede their eyes. It is required in Counſellers that trauaile in forraine Regions, to be well informed bothe of the gouernment of peace &amp; war in euery Country: of ordinary things, and extraordinary things: of the loue the King beares vnto his Subiects, and howe his vaſſailes are affected among themſelues: of the ſtrong Forts &amp; Caſtles: and of the humors and qualities of the men. Many are of opinion, that by great trauailing from home, they can attaine to wiſedome &amp; humane prudence, but that is nothing ſo: for that is not gotten by running into farre Countreyes, or by liuing an exile farre from home, but by communication and conuerſation with wiſe men. For it is not enough to haue béene in ſtrange Countreyes, and ſeene many Regions, and maners of diuers Nations, if he that trauaileth haue not the wit to reape profit by his being abroad. Concerning this matter, ye

                     Homer and Virgil to forme and make an heroicall man, and one adorned with all vertues, fayned that Vlyſſes and Aeneas had trauailed through all the world: and not contenting themſelues with this, they fayned that they deſcended into hell, and went into the Eliſian fields, and knew thoſe that were in them. Thus ought Counſellers of Princes to trauaile, imagining with themſelues what puniſhment they abide in hell for their wickednes, that counſell their Princes and others naughtilie, and the glory which they deſerue that counſell well. This doth the royall Prophet Dauid giue vs to vnderſtād, when he ſaith,Pſalme. 54. Deſcendant ad infernū viuentes. Anton. de Ge

                  22 Fredericus Furius would haue, that Counſellers of Princes ſhould knowe, what forces and power their Princes haue, and theyr Confederats, Freends, and Neighbours: for as the Phiſition, the firſt thing he conſidereth in mans bodie, is, what vertue and ſtrength it hath, and how much it is able to take, euen ſo a Prince his Counſeller, ought to know what forces, and howe great power his Prince hath, and thoſe that are his Friends and Confederates, that he may be able to cure the whole body of the Common-welth: and that in curing the one part, he hurt not the other, as if a Phiſition to heale one member, ſhould harme the other. Fredericus Furius ſaith, that the Counſeller of a Prince, ought to be a vertuous, vpright, and iuſt man: for ſuch a man loueth to giue euery man according to his deſerts. Which is, to puniſh thoſe that offend, and reward thoſe that doo well, and in all things he obſerueth due moderation: for in puniſhing he is not cruell or ſlack, or in rewarding ſcarce or exceſſiue, or vaine and to no purpoſe. Neither dooth he puniſh men more then their faults deſerue, nor make all faultes equall, as the Stoickes doe, nor diſſemble with mens offences, to turne the puniſhment with which the Lawes puniſh the offendourr, to theyr owne profit by taking brybes, as Dioniſius King of Sicil did, and they now a dayes doo, ye ordaine Lawes with which they may rob and ſpoyle the people. Theſe men are like vnto the hearbe Lumbricaria, which killeth the wormes called Lumbrici, and if there come no wormes neere it, it breedeth wormes of it ſelfe to kill thē afterwards. Theſe men alſo, to ſhew themſelues very diligent and zealous in executing iuſtice, either puniſh them that haue not offended at al, or in puniſhing them that haue doone amiſſe, they vſe more crueltie then the fault deſerueth. A Princes Counſeller ought to be francke &amp; liberall, for the people is greatly pleaſed with francknes, and loueth liberalitie, yea and admireth it. But the couetous man, is alwaies deteſted, and abhorred: for he dooth all for money, and to fulfill his greedines, ſetteth all things to ſale, nay, he dooth not ſo much as ſpeake without intereſt, and is ready to committe any treaſon whatſoeuer, ſo he be no looſer by it. Saluſt writeth, that Iugurtha going out of Rome, ſaid: O

Cittie, thou wouldeſt ſoone be ſold, if thou haddeſt a Chapman. The Counſellers of Princes, ought to take a pleaſure in dooing well. This vertue conſiſteth not in giuing of money, or beſtowing any of their ſubſtance or riches as liberalitie doth: but in helping the Common-wealth, and ayding each member of it, with good counſell: admoniſhing, warning, aduertiſing, praiſing and diſpraiſing, and fauouring by their authority and protection, not onely thoſe that craue fauour, aide, helpe, or ſuccor of them, but thoſe alſo that deſerue it without aſking. Counſellers ought alſo to be meeke and gentle, gracious in wordes, curteous and ſwéete in language, gentle in hearing of all men great and ſmall, rich and poore, and not to vſe ſlaunderous ſpéeches and ill words vnto them that ſpeake vnto them. For many men are ſooner mooued to caſt away themſelues, and loſe life and goods for a reprochfull anſwer, then for ſome heauier and greater iniurie offered in other ſorte. Moreouer, a Counſeller ought as it were to ſette open his doore, for all men to enter, of what condition or kind ſoeuer. And he ought alſo to be of great ſufferance and patience in hearing, and giue no man occaſion to fall in deſperation.
                  23 The Counſellers of Princes ought to be valiant, this valiantnes is not meant of ſtrength and forces of the body, but of the inward fortitude, and of the courage of the mind, by reaſon of which, men be called noble and heroicall, that is, more then men. As for the other corporall ſtrength, that, is commonIohannes de Orrena. to many, as to ſwaſh bucklers, Royſters, and other raſcall felowes that care not for their liues, and paſſe not if they ſell it for a button.

Fredericus Furius ſaith, that the Counſeller of a Prince, ought to be of a Chollericke or ſanguine complexion, and not of any other. For they that are of this mixture and temperature, are wittie, they haue a notable memorie, they can diſcourſe brauely, they haue an excellent iudgment, they are iuſt and vpright, they are louing, gentle in talke, loyall, beneficiall and liberall, honorable and ſumptuous, valiant, and of noble courage: their bodies be light and nimble, and of a good temperature. They that are Melancholicke, as they are by nature ſorrowfull, and of the ſelfe ſame complexion as the earth: ſo they be ruſticall, baſe, and heauie, ſcarce able to lift themſelues one handfull aboue the ground, vaine, and delighting in trifles, enemies to noble thoughts, malicious, ſuperſtitious: in ſo much that men of this complexion, haue waſted and vtterly ſpoyled all the Regions of ye world, with their dreames, fooliſh imaginations, and vaine viſions.

                      great Appolonius Tyaneus, founde a melancholicke perſon in the Cittie of Epheſus, who with his preſence onely, had corrupted the whole Cittie, and infected it with a great plague. To conclude, they that are of a melancholicke complexion, be dull and drowſie, heauie, vnſkilfull, vnlearned, and they haue no one vertue in them that excelleth, and all theyr qualities are leſſe then meane.
                  24 Although the Mellancholicke complexion, be not ſo

good as the Chollericke and ſanguine, yet it is by many calledLib. cui titulus examen ingeniorum. the heroicall complexion, becauſe they that are of that complexion, refuſe not to tell the truth, making no account of any danger at all: and after the ſame manner, as wine cauſeth them that be drunke, to vtter all what euer they thinke, euen ſo melancholie, maketh them that are full of blacke choller, to ſpeake the truth, and often-times they diuine &amp; tell of thinges to come. There haue béene many excellent men (as Ariſtotle ſaith) thatIn problemat. partic. 30. pro. 1. were melancholicke. And though thoſe inclinations be natural that cauſe the complexions in men, yet be they not (as thoſe that ſtudie Aſtrologie ſay) ordinances and decrees of Pretors. Inclinationes non ſunt edicta praetorum: and therfore it is commonlie ſaid, 
                        Ʋir ſapiens dominabitur aſtris, Euery wiſe man may cō
                     maund the ſtarres, and beare rule ouer them. For though the ſtarres and Planets encline to one thing or other, yet can they not force men to it that be wiſe and circumſpect, and of iudgement howe to gouerne themſelues. No inclination of ſtarre or Planet; can force ſuch men to doo that which they will not, nor take away from them &amp; depriue them of the frée-will that God hath giuen them, as I haue in more ample manner declared in my Bookes. De Amore diuino, humano, &amp; Caſto. Plutarch
                      writeth,In Apotheg. that Socrates was ſhewed to one, that affirmed he could iudge of any mans conditions and wit, by the phiſiognomie of his face: who when he ſaw Socrates, he ſaid, that he was dulheaded, and that he had a very rude witte, and that he was a great freende vnto women, and that he did men great iniurie, and that he was much giuen to wine, and that he was very incontinent. When Socrates his freends heard this, they became very angry with the Phiſiognomer, for they knew the contrary by Socrates, that he was a very honeſt man, and wel thought of among all men: but Socrates ſaide vnto them, that the Phiſiognomere ſaid the trueth, and that he verilie had béene ſuch a one, if Philoſophie had not taught him to be vertuous.
                  
                     Fredericus Furius wold haue, that the Counſeller of a Prince ſhould be of meane ſtature and thicknes, for extremitie in the proportion or bignes of the bodie, ſéemeth ill in a Counſeller, and diminiſheth his authoritie. For of ouermuch greatnes, all Philoſophers and Aſtronomers conclude, that knowledge and wiſedom, be ſeldome ſéene in a man that is very hie, eſpecially,

if he be very weake: and therefore it is ſaid, that a long weak man, is lazie and ignorant. As for them that be very ſhort and lowe, there is not ſo much want of gouernment in them, as in ouer-tall men, but onely this, that they be angry and preſumptious: and the people mocketh them, and maketh no account of them. Therfore a Counſeller ought not to be, neither too long, nor too thicke, for there is no body but he will laugh, when he doth ſée one man like a Barrell, and another like a Conger. To conclude, talenes or ſhortnes, ſo the meane proportion that all men commonly are of, be not notably excéeded, hinder not the iudgement &amp; prudence which is required in Counſellers. Little men (as the Author of the fiftie Sonnets ſaith) often times are endued with brauer gifts then others, as touching ye mind. Virgil ſpeaking of Tideus ſaith, that he was little of body, but yet very valiant.

                        Maior in exiguo regnabat corpore virtus.
                     
                  
                  Finallie, it is well knowne, that men meaſure not their length by ſpannes, to know by the meaſure of their bodies, what wit, iudgment and abilitie they haue.
                  25 The ſufficiencie of a Counſeller, as concerning his bodie (as Fredericus Furius writeth) is the naturall proportion, conformitie, &amp; perfection of his members, that nothing be wanting or ſuperfluous: for either of theſe two faultes, ſhew verie ill tokens of the mind, and alſo offendeth the ſight of thoſe that looke vpon him. The proportion of all the parts of the body, is an agréeing and equalitie of each member, the one with the other. The deformitie is quite contrarie, when the members of a mans body are vnequall, one arme longer then the other, one hand ſmall and the other thicke, one ſhoulder hie and the other lowe, and ſo other members ſome greater then the other. The perfections of the parts in mans bodie, is, when he is borne wanting neuer a part or member, and without any fault in any of them. As to growe crooked, to haue a crooked backe, lame, or without ſome arme or foote, by reaſon of the ſcarcitie or ſuper fluitie of the matter. For (according as all naturall Philoſophers prooue, and eſpecially Gallen) they that be ſo borne, alwaies haue tenne thouſande lacks and defects in their vnderſtanding, manners, and life. It is ſaid, that Ariſtotle commonlie vſed this Poeſie, God deliuer me from a man marked by

nature. To haue one foote, arme, or eye leſſe, or one member bigger then the other, doth not (as we haue ſaid) hinder ye wit, iudgment and wiſedome which is required in Counſellers, for we obſerue not thoſe qualities in a Counſeller, which we doo in a bond-ſlaue when we buy one: but the abilitie which he hath to giue counſell, &amp; the diſcourſe which he is able to make in the counſels. Fredericus Furius would haue alſo, that a Counſeller ſhould be fayre and wel fauoured, for they that are endued with that grace, for that gift onely they are beloued and honoured. Therefore it is neceſſarie, that a Counſellers head be well faſhioned, rounde, not ſharpe in the vpper end, nor very big, norIn problemat. particula, 10 problem. 3. Conciliator de prob. 3. deff. 76. very little. Ariſtotle ſaith, that they which haue little heads, are more prudent then they that haue great heads: if theyr heads be little in ſuch ſort, that the inward parts of the head be not wanting or diminiſhed. As for the proportion of the face, that ought to be ſome-thing flatter then round, not great, nor round, nor loden with fleſh, nor little: the fore-head large or meanely, not little, nor repreſenting gréefe or ſorrow: the eies of meane bignes, not too big, nor too little, cleere, not rowling, ſtedfaſt, not heauie, nor without reſt: the noſe large and thin, not ſhort nor turned vpwards: the lips, ſome-thing thicke, not very ſmall, falling ſome-thing downwards. Finally, Fredericus Furius would haue, that a Counſeller ſhould be comely, well fauoured, ciuill, and of good behauiour. No man can deny, but that the beautie of the face, is a rare and meruailous gift of nature, and in which ſhee worketh moſt artificiallie: as I wrote more at large in my bookes of Diuine, humane, &amp; chaſte loue. Where I ſet downe the qualities which a Gentlewoman ought to haue to be fayre. And much leſſe can any man denie, but that thoſe counſels that are accompanied with comlineſſe and beautie, are more acceptable then thoſe counſels, which are giuen by an vncomely man, and ſuch an ill fauoured fellowe as hath no grace. For if he that counſaileth be faire, his beautie doth procure, that his reaſons perſwade with more ſpeede and ſeleritie, as Lucane ſaith:

                        
                           Ʋultus adeſt verbis, facieſque-incenſa perorat.
                     
                  
                  And vertue is moſt acceptable when it procéedeth from a fayre perſon.

                        Gratior eſt pulchro veniens e corpore virtus.
                     
                  
                  
                     But becauſe counſelling conſiſteth cheefely in the wit, iudgment, and wiſedom which the Counſeller hath: we ought more to regard the Counſellers prudence then his beautie: for commonly the fayrer men be, the leſſer wit and iudgment they be thought to haue: therefore they be called fayre beaſtes or fine pictures, that be caried in ſhew on ſolemne daies. Experience teacheth vs, that nature often times ſupplieth ye want of beautie, with an excellent iudgment and ſubtiltie of wit. As the wittie Saphos ſaith:

                        Ingenio formae damna rependo meae.
                     
                  
                  The Emperour Frederick riding foorth a hunting, went to maſſe in a place, where he found a Prieſt that was very ill fauoured, at whom he meruailed greatly, looking vpon him: but the Prieſt perceiuing that the Emperour meruailed to ſée him ſo ill fauoured, ſaid vnto him as the royal Prophet Dauid ſaid:Pſalme. 99. 
                     Deus nos fecit, &amp; non ipſi nos, God made vs, &amp; not we our ſelues. And the Emperour talking with him, marked that he was a ſage and diſcréete man, and loued him ſo wel, that he made him high Chauncellor of all his Empire.
                  26 Counſellers, as Fredericus Furius ſaith, ought to haue an excellent and rare wit: for a ready and braue wit, is the beginning, meanes, and end, of hautie and heroicall enterpriſes. Yet wit onely (as we haue ſaid) is not enough to iudge whichPlato dialogo. 6. de Repub. of thoſe things that are conſulted ought to be doone, and which to be omitted, for this is belonging to wiſedome, and we ought more to reſpect, that the Counſellers of Princes be wiſe, then wittie, rich, or noble. For (as Plato ſaith) it is the poynt ofIn Alcibiad. 1. wiſe men to giue good counſell, &amp; not of thoſe that be welthie. And the Angell being demaunded by Tobias of what Tribe heTobit. 5. 11. was, anſwered vnto him: Dooſt thou ſéeke a ſtocke or familie, or an hired man to goe with thy Sonne? Though the vertue of counſelling well, conſiſteth more in wiſedome then in wealth, or nobilitie: yet it is ſuppoſed, that Gentlemen and rich men, are commonly better brought vppe and inſtructed then others, and that they doo better vnderſtand and know, what is belonging to the gouernment of the Common-wealth, then men of baſe linage and ſmall ſubſtance. And to put the counſell and gouernment of the Common-wealth, in the power of the Comminaltie, were to take the eyes out of the head, and place them

in the taile: as it is ſaid that the Snak
                        •
                      did, whereby he burſt his head. For, becauſe the eyes looke ouer the whole body, GodLactantius Firmianus de opiſicio Dej. cap. 8. placed them in the heade, and not in the other inferiour members: ſeeing then that the Rich men &amp; Noble men, are the head of the Common-wealth, they ought to haue a regard ouer her, counſelling what is moſt profitable for the conſeruation of the whole Common-wealth, and gouernment of the ſame, euen as the eyes looke to the whole bodie. The Venetians admit not any of the common ſort of people into their counſels, nor yet to the gouerment of their Common-wealth, neither doo they ſuffer any baſtards to become Coūſellers vnto the Duke, though theyFulgoſius conſil. 62. be made legitimate, neither may they be created Cardinals, for theſe be the Pope his Counſellers.

                  27 Princes ought to make election of Counſellers out of thoſe nations which they gouerne: for they that be naturallie borne in thoſe Prouinces, are better acquainted with ye eſtate of their Countrey, then Strangers be.

                     Bernard ſaith, that the Cardinals who be Counſellers vnto the Pope, ought to be choſen out of all Nations. The Ciuil lawes ordaine, that they which are of the Counſell-houſe, ſhould not leaue their own Countries: for they (as Gometius ſaith) know and vnderſtand the affaires of their Countrey better thē ſtrangers. Ariſtotle ſaith, that ſome Common-weales ordained and decréed, that none ſuch as had their liuings and poſſeſſions in

the borders of their enemies Countreyes, ſhould be admitted to the Counſell. For ſuch perſons, fearing to looſe their goods, wold not counſell that which were profitable for the Commonwealth. Some will haue that the Counſellers of a Prince, ſhould haue all their liuings, within the territorie and Lordſhip of the Prince whō they ſerue: for then, they fearing leaſt they ſhould looſe them if they counſell ill, or otherwiſe offende their Prince, and hauing no forraine place to flée to, they are more carefull of their charge and dutie towards their Prince. It concerneth euery Prince to haue ſuch perſons in his ſeruice, as put all their hope in him, and altogether depend vpon him: that euen as thoſe which paſſe ouer the Seas in ſome ſhippe, looke vnto the ſame ſhip leaſt they ſhould looſe their owne liues and ſubſtaunce, ſo they that counſell Princes, if their life and all their liuings conſiſt in the Prince his welfare, they wil giue him counſell with greater diligence &amp; care. For the Commonwealths are like ſhips and veſſels of the Sea, in which they be carried that liue in them. And by this meanes will the Counſellers take more héede of the publique profit, and counſel that which is moſt conuenient for the Common-wealth, ſéeing that their life and ſubſtance, dependeth vpon that Prince his ſafetie whoſe Counſellers they be, and that if the Prince decay, they muſt fall to decay alſo. If the Counſellers of Princes haue any lands or liuings in thoſe Countryes againſt which their Lords will wage warre, they ought to renounce them, imitating the great Captain Goncalo Hernando de Cordoua, who before hePaulus louius in vita magn

Some braue and noble Captaines gaue their goods vnto the Common wealth, becauſe the enemies commaunded, that it ſhould be cryed through all their Campe, that no one ſhould doo any hurt or domage to the poſſeſſions of thoſe Captaines againſt whom they warred: by this means to make, that the Cōmon-weales vnto whome thoſe Captaines ſerued, ſhould not truſt them, as I wrote more at large, in the bookes whith I compiled of Militarie Diſcipline.

iudgment, and learned and ancient men. For prudence, wiſedome and authoritie, and experience of all matters, conſiſt in continuance of time. They ought to be ſuch men as feare God, and are alienated from all couetouſnes and gréedines: and ſuch as loue to ſerue their Prince, and ſéeke▪ by all meanes poſſible, how to further their Country. Each Prince that maketh choiſe of Counſellers to be counſelled by them, ought to conſider, that nature bringeth foorth thrée ſorts of men, (as Heſiodus ſaith)Ariſto. lib. 3. Eth, vbi adducit authoritatem Heſiodj. Whereof the one ſort is of them, that through their owne naturall inclination, perceiue and know what ought to be doone, in the adminiſtration and gouernment of matters: and that which they iudge, they put it in vre, without the aduiſement, teaching, or helpe of any other perſon at all. This ſtate of men, is the chiefe &amp; principall among all others, and ſuch men ſéeme to be ſent by the prouidence of God, to the profit, welfare, and conſeruation of mans eſtate. The other ſort of men, is of ſuch perſons, as of their owne naturall inclinations, cannot themſelues iudge what is conuenient for them, to order and diſpoſe thoſe affaires well, that are committed to their gouernment: but they be endued with ſuch a naturall kinde of goodnes, that they willingly learne of others that are wiſer then themſelues, and obey them that giue them good counſell. The third ſort is, of thoſe perſons, that neither know of themſelues what is beſt, nor yet will learne of others, nor ſubmitte themſelues vnto the iudgment of thoſe that be more wiſe, refuſing to followe good counſaile when it is giuen vnto them. Theſe felowes doo more harme then good in the counſels of Princes, for their intent is onelie to gaine-ſay that which paſſeth their capacitie.

For little doth it profit that he is wiſe and faithfull who counſelleth, if he vnto whom counſell is giuen, haue not the wit to doo himſelfe good with it. Although all theſe qualities which writers require in Counſellers, be not founde in any one man, yet they ſerue to ſhew an Idea or patterne of a good Counſeller. And for that all theſe qualities, neuer concurre in one perſon, Princes

haue many Counſellers, that ſome may ſupply that which is wanting in others. For it is thought that a great many ſhallCap, in Canonicis, diſtincti. 19. Cap de quibus. diſtint. 20.

Titus Liuius ſaith, that for ye moſt part, when many aſſemble to conſult, the greater part ouercommeth the better. The reaſon is (as Plinie affirmeth) becauſe the iudgment and wiſedom of thoſe that counſell, béeing vnequall, their opinions neuertheleſſe and ſentences are equall, and their wiſedom is not regarded, but the number of thoſe that giue their voices; and though their prudence be vnequall, yet the opinions of the prudent and vnſkilfull together are equall. Finallie, one onely qualitie ſuffiſeth for all Counſellers to doo that which they ought to doo, viz. To be a good and true Chriſtian: for in this point, all whatſoeuer is written▪ touching ye vertues with which each Counſeller ought to be endued, is contained and included. For the puritie and ſinceritie of Chriſtian Religion, alloweth no vice, and ſuffereth not any perſon to profeſſe that Arte and Science, which he knoweth or vnderſtandeth not, and vnto which he is nothing fitte: to the hurt of his next Neighbor, and domage of the Commonwealth Eſpeciallie, ſéeing that the Arte which the Counſellers of Princes doo profeſſe, is the nobleſt of all Artes, which is, to rule and gouerne Nations. And for this cauſe is this Arte called of Plato and Ariſtotle, Architectonica:

good counſell profiteth the partie much vnto whom it is giuen, and it hurteth him nought at all that giueth it. Ignoraunt and vnſkilfull perſons ſay, Giue vs money, kéepe your counſaile to your ſelfe. But they that ſo ſay, perceiue not (as S. Ambroſe

For it is a thing more important to the Commonwealth, to giue the Prince good counſel (who is the head of the Common-wealth) then to rule and gouerne ſome Cittie well: for they that counſel the Prince, haue a care of the profit of the whole Common-welth, and of all thoſe that liue in the ſame, but they that beare rule ouer ſome Towne or Cittie, regard no other thing than the commoditie of the ſame place which they gouerne. By reaſon of the neceſſity that Princes haue of counſell in all matters concerning the Common-wealth, the lawes graunt many Priuiledges and exemptions to all Counſellers

of Princes: to the end the Common-wealth might be wel gouerned by their counſell, as well in time of peace as of warre.Libr. 1. officio. For little (as Tullie ſaith) profit Armes, if they vnto whom the gouernment of the Common-wealth is committed, conſult not what ought to be doone.

               The Prince is placed in the number of his Counſellers, and they be as members of the Prince (who is the head of the Common-welth) and (Gigas de crimine leſae maieſtatis, Libro, 1. Capit, 14, L. quiſquis cod. ad L. Iulian. L, 6. 1. de inſtitutione principis. as Dion ſaith) the Counſellers be the eyes and eares with which the Prince doth ſée and heare. And for this cauſe ought euery Prince to take good héede, and to enquire and examine very diligently, what men he maketh choiſe of to be his Counſellers: and they ought not to admit any one vnto their counſel, that hath no wit or iudgment: for this were alſo (as we haue before ſaid of baſe &amp; common perſons) to take the eyes from the head, &amp; place them in the féete, as the ſnake, &amp;c. Furthermore, a Prince ought not to admit any Idiots and vnlearned men, who know not how a Common-wealth ought to be gouerned, vnto the Counſel: for this were no leſſe to take the eyes out of the head, and place them in the féete then the other. And the Counſellers of Princes, ſéeing they be the eies of the Common-wealth, ought to procure the publique benefit of

the ſame, and loue thoſe that liue in it, as their owne naturall ſonnes and bretheren.
               7 The Ciuill Lawes ordaine, that the Counſellers of Princes7 P

And this Law was ordained by the Ladie Iane, Quéene of Naples, becauſe one of her Counſell called Andreas de Iſernia was ſlaine.
               9 The Counſellers of Princes may not be put to any torment, but the Councellers of Citties, are commonly racked, and otherwiſe tormented.
               10 The Counſellers of the Prince, may not procure any Office out of the Court, without the Prince his leaue.
               11 If the Colledge of y• Prince his Counſellers be diſſolued, the goods which the Colledge hath, are to be giuen to the Counſellers: and this is vnderſtood, of thoſe goods that are giuen by them that founded y• Colledge, and not of thoſe which the Colledge had of the Prince: for ſuch goods, (the Colledge beeing broke vppe) returne againe to the Prince who gaue them.
               12 If the Counſellers of the Prince giue ouer their Office, either becauſe the Prince doth licence them to doo it, or becauſe he chooſeth other Counſellers in their ſtéede, yet whilſt they liue, they doo not looſe their Priuiledges, exemptions and prerogatiues which the Lawe graunteth to Counſellers of Princes. This Priuiledge is graunted vnto them by reaſon of their dignitie, and Office which they haue borne: for which cauſe many things are permitted in Law. But if the Prince expel them out of his counſell, becauſe they be vicious and wicked, not content with ſuch rewards and penſions which are allowed them, but augmenting their ſtipend by bryberie and other vnlawfull

meanes, and ſo (as Iohannes Andreas a famous Lawyer counſelleth) be put beſide their Office, that the Prince may makeIn cap, quanto jure jurando. choiſe of vertuous, iuſt, and vpright men, which will regarde the publique commoditie more then they, then they that are ſo put out of theyr Office, enioy not any of the Priuiledges or oxemptions, which the Law graunteth vnto the Counſellers of Princes.
               13 The Counſellers of Princes are not bound to bring that13 Priuilegium.

               14 If any Counſeller die without an heire, his goods ſhal not14 Priuilegium Doctores in li. 1, cod, vnde vir &amp; vxor. Martin, Laud, vbi ſupra, q, 5, 15 Priuilegium.

               15 Although Counſellers ordinarily may not renownce the habitation of their birth, yet the Counſellers of Princes may, becauſe they haue their houſe and abiding place in the Courte, neither may they depart thence without they get leaue of the Prince. And if ſo be they doo leaue the Court, without licence from the Prince, then ought they to be rebuked, and the ſtipend to be paid vnto them, is to be kept backe for the time that they be, or haue béen ſo abſent. For he cannot be ſaid: to be from the Court in the behalfe of the Common-welth, who is not ſent by the Prince, but departeth without leaue▪ This (as Iohn Igneus 
                  In lib. 3 9, de his. n, 24. ff. de Senatꝰ conſul, Silhan. 16, Priuilegium. ſaith) belongeth to the honiſtie of a Counſeller, and ſeruire of the Prince, not to depart. from the Court, or ceaſe to counſell the Prince, according as in duety he is bound to doo.
               16 If the Prince cōmaund any thing centrary to that which the Law ordaineth, his Counſellers are not bounde to put the ſame in execution, and they ought to let the Prince vnderſtand why they obey not his commaund. The Ciuill Lawes ordaine L. vindicarj. cod, de penis, c. apud

               17 The Counſellers of Princes, may not buy any clothes, golde, ſiluer, or bond-men that belong to the Prince his Subiects. This (as Baldus &amp; the Doctors ſay) holds in thoſe Counſellers of Princes that gouerne and rule Citties. For it is ſuppoſed, that by reaſon of the Office which they beare, they will not giue as much as the things are worth: and (as Tullie ſaith) they had rather take them without paying for them, thē to buy them. Franciſcus Conomus affirmeth, that the Lawe which forbiddeth to buy gold, ſiluer, clothes or bond-men, toucheth not thoſe Officers and Magiſtrates, whom the Ciuill Lawes forbid to buy any thing in the Prouinces which they gouerne, for theſe haue a greater puniſhment appointed them, and the Law which we ſpeake of, doth onely require, that the price which was paid for things bought, ſhold be giuen to the kings Treaſure: and becauſe he for whoſe cauſe the Lawe was made and ordained, had charge of certaine particular things of ye Prince, (as we may gather by the Title and ſuperſcription of the ſame Lawe,) and becauſe it forbiddeth to buy clothes, golde, ſiluer or bond-men, it ſpeaketh of thinges particular belonging to theInd.

So that vnderſtanding that which the Law ordaineth after this manner, it holdeth not in thoſe which gouerne any prouinces, but in thoſe that accompany them: and it holdeth in all the Palatines or Courtiers, whither they dwel within the Princes Pallace, or whither they attend vpon him onely. Alciatus
                  In L. ſerinis cod. de palatin. ſacr. largitionū li. 12. ſaith, that thoſe which dwell within the Prince his Pallace, be called Comitatenſes, &amp; Palatinj: (for thoſe be the Courtiers that accompanie the Prince) and they that goe to rule or gouerne ſome place, are called Mittendarijs. According to that which Alciat affirmeth: that which the Law ordaineth, holds in thoſe Courtiers that dwell in the Princes Pallace, and attende vpon him. And béeing ſo that the Lawe was written of thoſe that dwelled within the Princes Pallace, the Law is to be vnderſtood, of thoſe Courtiers which dwel within the Court, and not of al other Courtiers: for it is thought, that thoſe that dwel within the Kings Pallace, wil buy ſuch things as belong

to the Prince, for a leſſer price then they be worth. The Lawe may alſo be vnderſtoode, of thoſe which buy things, which eſpecially belong to the Prince himſelfe, and not of thoſe which buy things that appertaine to Fiſco, that is, to his Treaſurie. If it be ſo that the Prince haue his wealth ſeperated from the goods of the Treaſurie, as the Emperors of Rome had in times paſt.

Treaſurie may be ſold, if they be brought to a publique place where they may be bought. For béeing ſolde after this manner, euery one may without danger of the Lawe buy thereof.
               18 The Counſellers of Princes, may licence any one, willing18 Priuilegium to build in publique place, for to doo it. And this is vnderſtoode, of thoſe Counſellers that are preſent in the counſaile of rewards

               20 Prelats and Eccleſiaſticall perſons, that be Counſellers of Princes, are not irregular, if they counſell their Prince to make or conſtitute Lawes which may puniſh thoſe that offend, with paine of death.

For the tenth man of

thoſe that were ſent to inhabite ſome place, was choſen to gouerne and rule it. Theſe Decurions, are called Counſellers andCap. ſtatuimus 11, q, 1, &amp; á cap. qui in §. quo. 51, d. defenders of thoſe Countries which they rule. The other Decurions, are called Decuriones Curiales: becauſe they were bound to ſerue in that Court or Seſſion, where the Judges that gouerned the place which they inhabited did frequent &amp; aſſemble, and where the Prieſtes or Curats did ſacrifice to theyr Idoles. Theſe are the Courts of which the Cannon-lawe makethWolfangus Iazius, lib, 3, de Repub. Roma. often mention. And thoſe that were called Decuriones Curiales, might not ſell or doo away their goods immoueable, neither might they leaue thoſe Countries wherein they ſerued. And becauſe they were bounde to gather and recouer the publique reuenewes, it was their charge to prouide maintenance for the Citties and Townes, and to appoint Tutors and Ouerſéers to all pupils, that ſhould guide and looke vnto them. And moreouer, ordaine ſuch as ſhould kéepe &amp; maintaine theyr portions▪ and if thoſe men, whom they had ordained to defend and kéepe Orphanes goods, dealt not well, they were bounde thēſelues to pay for them. They then béeing oftentimes much troubled, and verie hardlie dealt withall, refuſe their Office, and are vnwilling to ſerue the Common-wealth any longer: and theſe be the Decurions which may not ſell their goods. So that it is manifeſt, that this cannot be fitlie concluded of the Counſellers of Princes, becauſe the Decurions are bound vnto it: for the Counſellers of Princes haue no iuriſdiction, in ſuch manner as the Decurions haue, and are not bounde to be reſident in thoſe Townes and places which they gouerne.
               23 The Counſellers of Princes which ſtande their Prince23 Priuilegium in great ſtéed, may enioy the fruits of their liuings, though theyBoetius deciſione, 17. be not reſident in thē, for then they be abſent for the Commonwealths ſake. This holds not in Counſellers that haue nothing but the title and name of Counſellers, and ſerue not the Prince in giuing him counſell.

                  24 Priuilegium. Antonius Gerar. in Repub. Norimb. haue this Priuiledge, that thoſe wils and Teſtaments in which two of them be witneſſes, are of force. For it is ſuppoſed that thoſe men which are choſen out of the whole Common-wealth, and elected to be the Rulers of it, are perſons of ſuch credite, reputation and authoritie, that the teſtimonie of

two of them is ſufficient in all ſuch acts as the Lawes ordaine to be made in preſence of a great many witneſſes. Xenocrates

Cap, cum eſſes diſt. de teſtam. the Philoſopher, was of ſuch credite and reputation in Athens, that when he was brought before the Judges to witneſſe any thing, they would not let him ſweare. And this ſéemeth to be the reaſon, why Pope Alexander the third, commaunded that thoſe wils and Teſtaments of the Pariſhioners, in which the Prieſt that had the cure ouer their pariſh was a witnes, with two or thée more, ſhould be forcible in lawe. For it is to be thought, that he who hath a cure ouer the whole Parriſh, and vnto whoſe charge all the pariſhioners commit their conſciences, ought to be had in ſuch account, and of ſuch credit and authoritie, that his teſtimonie ſhould be as forcible in any act, asLib, 8, cap, 4, cō

               25 Princes may not doo any thing of importance touching the Common-wealth, vnleſſe they firſt conſult about it with their Counſellers. For as Martinus Laudenſis affirmeth, whatſoeuer the Prince commaundeth, without taking aduice of his Counſellers, is not accounted to be iuſt &amp; lawfull. This which the Doctors ſaie, holds not in ſuch Princes as acknowledge no ſuperiour or higher power aboue them, but in ſuch onely as be not ſupreme Princes. As in ancient times paſt, the Emperors of Rome acknowledged the Senate to be in authoritie aboue them, and tooke counſell in the Senate about all ſuch things as they were to ordaine and commaunde: and if they did not rule and gouerne the Common-wealth as they ſhould doo, then theyIn rubric, de cō

Neither doth it holde (as Ripa and Phillippus Probus ſay) in thoſe Princes which ordaine and conſtitute any thing concerning that which dependeth vpon the Poſitiue law. For the Prince himſelfe onely, without taking any counſell of his Counſellers, may ordaine and commaund any thing, whatſoeuer ſéemeth vnto him to be profitable vnto the Commonwealth. But if he commaunde any thing, which appertaineth

vnto the Law of God and nature, he may not doo it vnleſſe he do firſt take aduice of thoſe that be of his Counſell. But becauſeL, 1, ff, de conſtitu. princip. ibi populus ei &amp; in eum omne imperium ſuum cō
                     tulit. ſuch a Prince as doth not acknowledge any ſuperiour, hath all that power which the Senate in olde times paſt was wont to haue, whatſoeuer he commaundeth, is of force, and ought to be obſerued, whether it be pertaining vnto the Poſitiue Lawe, or vnto the Lawe of God and nature: which the Prince may expound. For it is ſuppoſed to be commaunded by him, ſéeing that he hath all the power to commaund, and ordains that the Common-wealth had. This dooth not hold, if that which the Prince commaundeth be notoriouſly wicked and vniuſt. For in ſuchActs. 5. matters, we ought rather to obey GOD, then men. Further, more, although ſupreme Princes may enioyne any thing to bée doone, which they ſuppoſe to be moſt profitable for the Common-welth, &amp; yet not make their Counſellers acquainted withIacobatius vbi ſupra. it: neuertheleſſe, to the end they may alwaies be obeyed, and that which they commaund, continually put in practiſe by their Counſellers, they ought neuer to doo any thing of importance, except they take aduice of their Counſellers about it. And it was an ancient cuſtome in Spayne, that the Counſellers of the Prince, ſhould be witneſſes in thoſe contracts and wils which the Prince made.
               26 The Counſellers of Princes, in thoſe contracts, teſtaments,26 Priuilegium L. Curialis. cod. de decuri. lib. 10. and wils which they make, ought to haue a reſpect vnto that which the Lawes ordaine, though they be exemted in thoſe caſes in which they be eſpeciallie priuiledged.

               27 The Counſellers of the counſell of the eſtate, are to be preferred before Counſellers of other counſels, when counſell is taken vpon matters concerning that counſell: for they haue a care ouer the whole Common-wealth, and doo more particularly repreſent the perſon of the Prince. But if counſell be taken vpon matters touching warre, then they that ſitte in the counſell of warre, are to be preferred aboue the others. For (as Titus Liuius ſaith) one Colledge or Senate is preferred before the other, but not mē ſome before others. And it ſeemeth that by

this which we haue ſaid, that Queſtion is decided and diſcuſſed, about which In tractatu de authoritate magni concilij.

To wit, that the Counſellers of Princes, ought to be ſome preferred before others: and in what places they which more eſpecially repreſent the perſon of the Prince, ought to be preferred, as members more particular of the Prince. For euē as they that come néereſt to the fire, warme themſelues moſt, becauſe they feele moſt heate, ſo the Counſellers that be moſt familiar with the Prince, are moſt eſtéemed of in all places. Eſope the Hiſtoriographer, ſaide vnto Solon, that thoſe which were to be conuerſant with Kings, ſhould either talke verie little with them, or very familiarly. Solon anſwered, yt it was a great deale more ſafer for them, not to be in their company at all: and that if ſo be they were, it was neceſſary for them to be very prudent and warie. For Princes are like to fire, and they that be néereſt vnto them, incurre moſt danger.

                  EVen as they that counſell well and giue ſincere aduice, are Miniſters of God, and be rewarded by him, both in this life and in the next: ſo theyCap. bonae, 12, q. 2, bonae rej. Cap. nequitiae diſtin, 86. that counſel maliciouſly and deceitfullie, are miniſters of the deuill, and God doth puniſh them, both in this life and in the life to come, and if they doo giue maliciouſlie their Prince naughtie and wicked counſell, they caſt venim and poyſon (as Plutarch ſaith) into the common Fountaine,In opuſculo, cum princip• maximè philoſophum diſputare debere. which runneth through all the Cittie, and euerie man doth vſe it: and by howe much the more harme the Commonwealth taketh by their double counſell, by ſo much the more deſerue they to be puniſhed. And that they be miniſters and ſeruaunts to the deuill, may eaſilie be prooued, ſéeing that the OfficeIohan. 8. Quia mendax eſt &amp; pater eius. 1. Peter. 5. of the deuill, is to deceiue, to lye, to coſin, and vſe a thouſand ſetches and crafts to doo men harme: for this is his onelie intent, and his ginnes and ſnares, which he vſeth to entangle men, are ſuch and ſo many, that men can verie hardly eſcapeApoc cap. 12.

And not onely the deuill, but alſo the world and fleſh giue thoſe perſons ill counſell, that take aduice of them. For the world (as the famous Doctor Azpilcoeta ſaith)In repetitj. cap. inter ver. 11. q. 3 dooth counſell thoſe that ſerue Princes, to pleaſe their Lordes and Kings, though it redownde to the manifeſt danger of theyr ſoules, and vtter ruine of the whole Common-wealth. For ſo dooing, they ſhall obtaine honour, quietnes and profit: not to themſelues onely, but to their friends alſo: if they doo the contrarie, they ſhall diſpleaſe both their Prince and thoſe Peeres alſo which be fauoured of the Prince, becauſe they pleaſe him, and follow that counſell which the world giueth them. The gloriousCap, Nemo, peri. q, 3, cap, Nolite q, 3. Nolite timere eos qui occidunt corpus, ne forté propter timorem non dicatis libere quod verum eſt. Matth, 10, Iohn, 8, Math, 16, 17. S. Auſten ſaith, that it is better to ſuffer torment for ſpeaking the trueth, then to receiue rewards for flatterie. And S. Chriſoſtome ſaith. Feare not them that kill the bodie, leaſt for feare of them, thou ſpeake not the trueth fréely. The verie ſame doth our Sauiour Chriſt teach vs, ſaying. And feare yee not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the ſoule, but rather feare him which is able to deſtroy both ſoule and bodie in hell. Furthermore, againſt them that folow the counſell of the fleſh, our Sauior ſaith: Ye iudge after the fleſh, and praiſing S. Peter, he ſaith: Bleſſed art thou Simon the Sonne of Ionas, for fleſh and blood hath not reuealed it vnto thée, but myLibro, 1, de legibus. Father which is in heauen. Plato affirmeth, that euery man carieth two Counſellers about him, that be contrary one to another, and bothe of them voide of reaſon: to wit, Pleaſure and Greefe, for delight and paſſion giue ill counſell. And Iulius Caeſar, in a certaine Oration which he made in the Senate, ſaide, Omnes homines. P. C. qui de rebus dubiis conſultant, ab odio, amicitia, ira atque miſericordia vacuos eſſe decet, that is. It becommeth all men that conſult vppon matters which are vncertaine andCap. magnae de voto quid liceat ſecundum aequitatē, quid deceat ſecundum honeſtatem, quid expediat ſecundum vtilitatem. doubtfull, to haue their minds frée from hatred, freendſhippe, anger, and mercie. Therefore Counſellers of Princes, to counſell well and ſincerely, without mallice or deceit, they ought to conſider (as Innocentiꝰ the third Pope ſaid) thrée things. Firſt, whether that which is in conſultation, be lawfull according to iuſtice: then whether it be comely according to honeſtie: and

laſtly, whether it be expedient, according to profit. And Innocent (as the famous Doctor Azpilcoeta ſaith) did firſt put downIn cap, inter verba, 
                        •
                     , 64, 11, q, 3, that which is lawful, honeſt, and comelie, and afterwards that which is expedient for the profit of the Cōmon-welth, to ſhew, that though that which is conſulted, be lawfull according to the world, yet if it doo comprehend any ſinne in it, mortall or veniall, it ought in no caſe to be put in execution: nor alſo if it be not approoued of wiſe and graue men, although it were neuer ſo profitable: after the example of the Athenians, who becauſePlutarchus in vita Themiſto. the counſell which Themiſtocles gaue them, was vniuſt, wold not follow it, when as notwithſtanding it was verie profitable.
               2 If the Counſellers of Princes freelie vtter that, which they déeme to be moſt profitable for the Common-wealth, they are not to be blamed howſoeuer the matter falleth out: for the ſucceſſe (as we haue ſaid) and euents of things, conſiſt not in theDiſcurſu, 1, §. 6, power of man: and (as Vlpian the Lawyer ſaith) he that counſellethL, Conſilij, ff, de regulis juris con ſilij non fraudulenti nulla eſt obligatio, cap. nullus de regulis juris. L. tua §. final. without mallice or deceite, deſerueth no puniſhment, ſeeing that he vnto whom the counſell is giuen (as the Emperour Iuſtinian affirmeth) may chooſe whether he will put the counſell in practiſe or not.
               They that giue counſell without mallice or falſhood, (according to the Lawyers) differ frō them that vſe guile and fraude in giuing counſell, in this: that they which counſell vprightlie and ſincerelie, are not bound to make ſatiſ-faction for ye domage or loſſe which any man doth get by folowing their counſel, whither he that aſketh the counſell, be determined to followe the counſell which they giue, or be not: and, whether he vnto whō the counſel was giuen, would not haue doone according vnto it, vnleſſe it had béene giuen him: or would haue doone it, thoughCagnolus, in d, l. conſilij. no ſuch counſell had béene giuen him: and, whether they giue counſell to ſuch as aſke aduice of them, or to ſuch as aſke none:Hyeronimus Francus, in d, l. conſilij. and laſtlie, whether they ſhew any reaſon, why they think that counſell to be good which they giue, or ſhewe not any reaſon at all. Againe, they that counſell a man to doo any thing, and doo onely ſhew him a reaſon why they counſell him to doo ſo, differ from them that commaund and perſwade a man to doo a thing, in this: that they which giue a man counſell, and make him acquainted with the reaſons which mooue them to giue ſuch

counſell, which the Lawyers terme Exhortari, doo

And therfore Vlpian ſaith, that it is more to perſwade one to commit ſome offence, then to compell or conſtraine him to doo it: for mens mindes are more mooued by perſwaſion, then by compulſion or commandement. And therefore Cornelius Tacitus and Plato ſaie, that the Arte which teacheth men to perſwade, is the moſt excellent and noble Arte of al Artes: for that which by mans force could not be atchiued, hath oftentimes béene obtained by eloquence: as I writt more at large in my bookes of Militarie diſcipline.
               3 Though they that giue counſel without malice or fraud, be not bound to make ſatiſ-faction for the domage or harme that commeth by their counſell, yet they that profeſſe any Arte, or take any Office vpon them, are bounde in the Court of conſcience,Cagnolus in d, L. conſilij, n, 4. to make ſatiſ-faction for the loſſe and harme that the parties take by folowing the counſel which they giue: for they are bounde to open the trueth vnto thoſe that aſke aduiſement of them, in ſuch things as appertaine vnto their Arte: as alſo Aſſeſſors, Aduocats, interpreters of Lawes, Proctors, Solicitors, Phiſitions, &amp; all others are, ye being ignorant of the Arte whichIn L, quidā exiſtimauerunt, ff. ſi cert petatur, á.

Speculator will haue, that Aduocates or Patrons that defende the poore, or them that be falſelie accuſed, ſhal not be bound to make ſatiſ-faction of the domage that commeth by their counſaile, ſo they vſe no couine or deceite therein: albeit that ignorance is counted a fault. For this doth hold, as Bartholus ſaith, in Judges, w

                  oſe dutie is of neceſſitie, and not in Counſellers, whoſe duetie is voluntarie.
               Againſt this opinion of Bartholus, doo they make, which affirme, that the ignorance or want of ſkill in the Phiſition, is counted a fault, and that they which profeſſe that Arte wherof they haue no ſkill, are fault-worthy: for they deceiue thē that

This (if IIohan. Eckius in tractatu de materia Iuramenti ad finem. Probus in cap, vt commiſſi. n 2. de haereticis, li. 6. per le. 3, §. magis ff, de teſtibus. L. debetur. be not deceiued) doth hold in thoſe cauſes, which are manifeſtlie knowne to be vniuſt: for in thoſe cauſes which depende vppon proofes and witneſſes, (which onely conclude to the Judge) and in thoſe cauſes which depend vpon expoſitions of Texts, vpon opinions of Doctors, and vpon the will and arbitrement of the Judges: (which is as frée, that though the cauſes be iuſt, yet it is verie vncertaine what ſentence the Judges will giue,) Patrons and Aduocates are not forbidden to defende ſuch cauſes, (ſéeing they be not manifeſtly known to be vniuſt) but yet they be bound to open the truth vnto their Clyants, and procure that the ſtrifes and ſutes in Lawe, be not immortall, &amp; euerlaſting, vſing malicious and craftie fetches to deceiue the Cliants or parties pleading.

For this holdeth in thoſe Phiſitions that be ignorant of thoſe things, which they commonlie ought to knowe, which profeſſe the Arte of curing: and this is the ignorance that is counted aL, labeo, ff, de verbor, ſignificatione. fault, for they vſe deceite and craſt in profeſſing that wherein they haue no ſkill.

That which we haue ſaid of Patrons and Aduocates holdeth, whether they take money for theyr counſell or no: albeit

this holdeth not in thoſe that ſay without conſultation, what in ſuch a matter ought to be doone. For thoſe that anſwere queſtionsAngelus in d. §. praeterea ſi medicus per leg, idē juris ff, ad legē Aquiliā, quem ſequitur Mainetius in d, L. Imperitia. demaunded of them, are not bound without rewards to reſolue doubts which they aſke of them in the Arte which they profeſſe. And many loth to ſpend monie, propoſe their doubts to ſome learned men: who, though they anſwere conformable to the rules of the Law, which they remember at the time yt theyr counſaile is aſked: and albeit they anſwere according to their conſcience, yet be they not bound to call to remēbrance al which both diuine and humane law diſpoſeth and intreateth, in matters that may fal out: for this (as the Emperor Iuſtinian ſaith) is a thing more diuine then humane: and the fault lyeth in theL. 2. §. ſi quid. Clyents, who becauſe they ſhould not pay fée vnto the learned, are contented with the anſwer which their Counſel giue, without ſtudie vpon the caſe. For ſuch anſwers and counſails, are by the Lawyers termed, Conſilia et reſponſa volatilia; ſuch as are lightly paſſed, and are not conſidered and examined, but lightly giuen, and are like fethers carried away with the wind, hauing nothing in them like to counſaile, but the name onelie: for it is giuen without meditation or ſtudie, onelie to ſatiſfie their importunitie that aſke. Furthermore, if he that giueth a man coū
                  ſaile, perſwade the partie to followe his aduice, becauſe of the profit which he himſelfe may get thereby, and not for that he vnto whom he giueth aduice, ſhould be the better by it: then is he bound to make ſatiſ-faction for the loſſe which the partie taketh by folowing his counſaile. As for example. One knowingHieronimus Francus, in d,

This man is bound to paie for him, whoſe ſufficiencie he aſſured to the Merchaunt that lent the money; for vnleſſe he had warranted the banck-routs abilitie, the Merchant had not truſted him with his goods. Againe. One burſt not take a Seruant, becauſe he doubted of his trueth; another told, him that

               5 The prouidence of God, (in whoſe power the counſailes of men be) doth often permitte, that thoſe counſailes which are giuen fraudulently and maliciouſlie, become hurtful vnto thoſe that giue them: according to that of Salomon.

               6 The Counſellers of Princes, are bound to conceale that which is conſulted with them: for all that which is ſaid to one in ſecrete, and committed vnto him as a thing to be concealed, ought both by the lawes of God and man, to be kept ſecrete by him. Therefore, if Counſellers of Princes diſcouer thoſe counſels

which by the Prince are committed to their ſecrecie, they be periured: for they doo contrarie to their oathe, which is, toIn titulo de forma fidelj. keepe ſecrete all what ſoeuer their Princes communicate vnto them.

Therefore they that ſweare, are not bound to conceale any thing which is ſaid vnto them if it be vnlawfull, and hurtfull to the Common wealth. As for example. If any man tell his ſeruaunt, that he will kill ſome bodie, the ſeruant ought to diſwade him from ſo dooing: and if he cannot alter his mind, or remedie his purpoſe any other way, he ought to diſcouer it: but ſo, that the diſcouering of the enterpriſe, be profitable to the one, and not hurtfull to the other; &amp; he oughtMartin, ab A

If the Counſellers diſcouer theyr Prince his ſecrets not to hurt the Prince, but to harme ſome other perſon: and if the Prince doo take any loſſe by the diſcloſing of his ſecrets, the Counſellers looſe their fees which they receiue of the Prince; for they do not performe that which they ſwore, to wit, that they would help and aide the Prince both in word and déed. They aide and aſſiſt the Prince in words, in giuing of him faithfull and ſincere counſaile, without malice or deceite: and they aſſiſt him, in déed, by executing that which he commaundeth.
               Moreouer, if they that diſcouer their Prince his ſecrets, be neither Counſellers nor Secretaries vnto the Prince, they ought to be put to death, if any hurt befall vnto the Prince by

the diſcouerie of his ſecrets: but if they diſcouer it, not intending to hurt the Prince, but commending him for ſome thing,Hippolitus de Marſiliis cōſil, 1. wherewith they doo him harme: then they ought to be extraordinarilie and moderatlie puniſhed: for they intended not toL. cuius dolo ff, ad l, Iuli, maieſt, &amp; leg, ſi quis aliquid, §. tranſfugae. ff, de paenis, ibi, tranſfugae ad hoſtes vel noſtrorum conſiliorum renunciatore, aut viui exurantur aut furca ſuſpendantur. hurt the Prince, and that offence which is committed without malice or deceit, ought not to be puniſhed. But if they wittingly diſcouer any of the Prince his ſecrets, the diſcloſing of which, may doo the enemie good, they ought either to be burned quick, or to be hanged.
               7 The ancient Poets, becauſe men ſhold know how neceſſarie it is for Princes, to haue ſuch Counſellers, as conceale thoſe ſecrets which are committed vnto them, fained that Tantalus was in hell, and had bothe water and pleaſant fruites by him, but though he greatly deſired to drinke of the water, and taſte of the Apples, yet hee could not: for when hee ſtooped toLotinus conſideratione. 460. drink, or reached to the fruite, both the water and the trée did mooue from him; and this torment was appointed him, becauſe he did diſcloſe that which the Gods had in their counſaile determined.
               They fained alſo, that Siſiphus was tormented in hell,Bocacius de genialogia Deorū. lib, 13. cap. 56. Eraſmus in ada. Saxum voluere. for diſcouering the counſaile of the Gods: and that this puniſhment was allotted him, that he ſhould turne a ſtone vp to the toppe of an huge and mightie Hill, on his ſhoulders, but when it was at the toppe, it ſhould fall downe againe and renew his labour. Theſe puniſhments were fitte rewards for their offences: for as the counſailes of the Gods tooke no effect, becauſe they were diſcloſed by Tantalus and Siſyphus, ſo it was verie well appointed, that Tantalus ſhould neuer eate nor drink whē he gréedilie deſired: and that Siſyphus ſhould continually labor carrying the ſtone on his ſhoulders, without bringing that to paſſe which he ſo earneſtly endeuoured.

For they thought that hee, which would not bridle ſo ſmall a member as the tongue, could much leſſe refraine the other greater members. And in déed, greater ſecrecie ought to be vſed in the counſailes of Princes, then in any other thing, and great care ought to be taken, that no man vnderſtand what is conſulted, or know what is at

the Counſell-table determined.
               King Lyſimachus demaunded of the Poet Philipides, ofPlutarchus in tractatu de curioſitate, which of his matters hee ſhoulde make him partaker: he aunſwered, that of which he pleaſed, vppon condition it were not of his ſecrets: becauſe of the daunger which they incurre, that diſcouer the ſecrets of Princes.

For it is a greater matter (as Vlpian the Lawyer ſaith) to perſwade one to committe ſome offence, then to force or compell him to doo it. For it is not tollerable, (as the ſame Vlpian affirmeth) that an ill deede ſhoulde be either prayſed or approoued.
               Others diſtinguiſh, that each offence eyther is of ſuch qualitie, that it is not puniſhed, vnleſſe it be committed, or it is pnniſhed after the ſame manner, as if it had béene committed, though he that dooth intend to offende, doo not committe the offence: and in ſuch kinde of faults, that holdes not, which wee haue before ſaide, of him that dooth onelie giue the counſaile.

and neere contracts, or about offences. Others diſtinguiſh of them that giue counſaile vnto thoſe, which vnleſſe they had beene counſailed, would not haue committed it: and of thē that giue counſaile vnto thoſe, that would haue committed it though they had not béene counſailed. Others diſtinguiſh, of thoſe counſails that be giuen, to doo him good vnto whom they be giuen, or to profit others. Others diſtinguiſh, of thoſe that giue counſaile before the offence is committed, and thoſe that giue counſaile after it is committed: counſayling and exhorting the offendour, to perſeuere and goe forward in the execution of the offence. According to that which we in Spayne doo commonlie vſe to ſay.

               The firſt is, that hee which counſaileth without mallice, deſerueth no puniſhment. For it is ſuppoſed, that he who ſo giuethD▪ l, conſil. conſilij non fraudulenti nulla eſt obligatio. counſaile, is a good man: and by reaſon of this ſuppoſition, he that chargeth him that he counſailed fraudulently, is to prooue it: and to reduce his intent ad actum.

But if counſaile be giuen to commit any offence, or to execute any unlawfull acte, or to put any thing in practiſe which is contrarie to the Lawes of GOD or man: then is he ſuppoſed and thought to be faultie, that in ſuch a caſe giueth counſaile. For it is the voyce of the deuill (as Saint Ierome wryteth) which doth perſwade men to doo ſuch things, as be cleene contrarie to the diuine and humane Lawes, and which offend God.
               Vnto this rule, Lucas de Pena reduceth two hundreth and twentie three caſes.
               The other rule which Vlpian giueth, is; That if hee vnto whom counſaile is giuen to committe any offence, may not be puniſhed, by reaſon of ſome priuiledge, by which he is exempted: then he which giueth the counſaile, ought to be puniſhed in ſuch ſort, as he that putteth a weapon into the hand of a mad man to kill ſome bodie with it.
            
            
               The ninth diſcourſe, whether it be better for the Commonwealth, that the Counſellers of the Prince ſhould be learned, or vnlearned.
               
                  THey that affirme, that it is more profitable for the Common-wealth, that the Counſellers of the Prince, ſhoulde be learned then vnlearned, alleage that which Ageſilaus King of the Lacedaemonians ſaide: that it did not become theLotinus conſideratione, 74 eſtate and royall dignitie of a Prince, to haue vnlearned men to his Counſellers: for though rude and ignoraunt men are ſubtile and watchfull, and looke to the publique commoditie: yet much greater is the harme which the Prince taketh, for want of learned mens companie, then the profit which commeth

by the craftineſſe and ſubtiltie of the vnlearned: for no man maketh account of that profit, which is not accompanied with honeſtie and vertue. For, this is it, for which all Princes be eſtéemed, honoured, and reuerenced.
               
                  Elius Lampridius ſaith, that the Emperour Alexander Seuerus,
                  In vita Alexan. Seueri. had many excellent Lawyers in his Counſell, with whom he conſulted vpon all matters concerning the Commonwealth. And becauſe he ruled himſelfe, by the counſaile of wiſe and learned men, which did not onelie regarde the Emperours ſeruice, but alſo the publique commoditie of the whole Empire: hee commaunded nothing, but that which was moſt iuſt and lawfull.

The Emperour Diocleſian, ſayde, that Princes coulde verie hardlie hitte the marke in that which they doo, andFlauius Vopiſcus in vita Aurelij. imperatoris. commaunde; becauſe all they that be conuerſant with them, doo theyr beſt to deceiue them, who beeing alwaies occupied, knowe no more of matters then they are informed, by them with whom they ſpeake. Apelles, in the portraiture of Princes,Lucianus de Calumnia. which hee preſented to King Prolomie, paynted a Prince ſitting in a Chayre of eſtate, with great hands and large eares, and by him were two Damoſels, the one called Ignoraunce, the other Suſpition: and Calumnia accempanied with her Siſter Ladie Flatterie. As I haue written more at large, in my Treatiſe of the inſtitution of a Chriſtian Prince.
               
                  3 Séeing that Princes muſt neceſſarililie vſe the conuerſation of many men, and verie diuers perſons, it is no leſſe neceſſarie for them, to reape profit by the ſubtiltie and craftines of the vnlearned; then by the ſkill and learning of thoſe that be highlie learned.

And experience teacheth, that Princes further their eſtate no leſſe with the ſubtiltie of the vnlearned, then with the learning of Schollers: for they that apply themſelues to learning, are but little ſkilled in action and practice, and knowe not howe to contriue the affaires of the Commonwealth.

Learned men be verie doubtfull, and perplext in giuing their reſolutions of thoſe matters vpon which they cōſult: for they find many difficulties and ambiguities, and many inconueniences, which make them to ſtand in great perplexitie, full of imaginations, and reſpects which doo not profit at all. Homer going about to deſcribe a wiſe, prudent, expert, and an abſolute Prince, (ſuch an one as he fained Vlyſſes to be) ſaith not that he deliuered himſelfe out of ſo many troubles and dangers, in which he oft found himſelfe: becauſe he was learned, or brought vppe in good literature at ſchooles, or becauſe he had ſpent much time in haunting thoſe Vniuerſities that floriſhed in his time: but for that he was verie wittie, watchfull and ſubtile, &amp; could quicklie and readilie perceiue and fore-ſée how things would fall out.

To be ſhort, no man can denie, but that Princes haue great neceſſitie to vſe the ſeruice of learned men and Schollers, to helpe and aſſiſt them in the gouernment of the people which is committed to their charge, as Iethro counſelled Moſes to do: for by reaſon of the great and manifoldExodus. 18. buſines which they haue, they are not able to miniſter iuſtice themſelues vnto their Subiects, without the helpe and ſeruice of wiſe and learned men, that vnderſtande and knowe what is profitable and neceſſarie for the Common-wealth, conformable to the Lawes &amp; ordinances by which it is gouerned. And that the Counſellers of Princes may performe their duetie accordinglie, it is conuenient they ſhold giue themſelues to the reading of many Hiſtories and Chronicles, that when they conſult, they may turn that to their profit, which hath in like matters ſuccéeded and fallen out at diuers times, and in ſundry places. For they that haue ſéene little, and know no more thē theyCicero in Oratore ad Brutum. Cap. 8. haue ſéene, are but children in reſpect of them that haue read much, and (as Iob ſaith) they that haue onely experience of thē
                  ſelues, &amp; are not confirmed by the example of others that went before them, are but of yeſterdaie. Plato reporteth, that a certaineIn Timaeo. 
                  Egiptian Philoſopher ſaide vnto Solon, that the Philoſophers of Greece, were as children in compariſon to thē of Egipt, becauſe the Egiptian Philoſophers were verie ancient, and had long time before, giuen themſelues to the contemplation &amp; conſideration of diuine and naturall things.
               The difference betwéene them that haue ſéene, and alſo read and heard many things, and thoſe that know no more then they haue ſéene (which for the moſt part is but little) is this: that they which haue ſéene, read, and heard many things, may fréelie ſpeake in all places, concerning all matters. And for this cauſe it is commonlie ſaid, that three ſorts of men may diſcourſe fréelie; Old men at home: young mē abroad: and men of great reading euery where.
               
                  5 My intent is not to prooue, that it is not neceſſarie for Princes to haue learned men to giue them counſell, ſéeing that they haue ſuch great néed of men, that can examine and waigh, whether that which is conſulted be conformable to iuſtice and reaſon, but that which I ſay, tendeth to this end, that men may well enough be learned, without haunting many Uniuerſities, or continuing long in Schooles to take degrées, &amp; become Maiſters, Licentiats, Bachelers and Doctors: for there haue béene many men in the worlde, that haue béene excellent fine Schollers, and wonderfull well learned, that were not either Bachelers, Licentiats, Maiſters, or Doctors, created in the Vniuerſities of their time: for the degrees which nowe a daies are giuen in Vniuerſities, vnto them that ſtudie in them, tooke beginning but ſeuen hundred yéeres agoe: and in déede, many labour more to be Doctors and Graduats, then learned: as I writt more at large in my treatiſe of Schooles and Readers.
               Therefore men may verie well become learned, and be good Schollers, without béeing Bachelers, Maiſters, Licentiates, or Doctors▪ if in ſtéed of ſpending the time in ſuch exerciſes and paſſetemps, as be but little profitable to the Common-welth, they did read Hiſtories and Treatiſes concerning Princes and Common-weales: but eſpecially ſuch Bookes and diſcourſes that treate of things touching the Princes of their own Countrey, and thoſe Princes whom they ſerue: ſéeing they ought to counſel them according to that which they find and read in ſuch diſcourſes, Hiſtories, and Chronicles: for neither Acurtius nor Bernard teach them any ſuch thing. Men may alſo be learned, (as Euripides and Plato ſay) by béeing conuerſant with men ofIn fine Dialogi. 8. de Republica. vnderſtanding and literature: for thereby of rude and vnlearned men, they become ſkilfull and prudent, and by this meanes they come to be acquainted with the Lawes, by which ye Common-wealth is ruled, &amp; to giue counſel according as the Lawes ordaine and commaund, in ſo much, that though men be ſubtile craftie, and watchful, yet be they no whit the better for that to rule Countries: for gouernment doth not procéed from wilines and ſubtiltie, but from vertue and iuſtice.
               6 Iſocrates counſelleth Princes to enquire, whether theIn pareneſi. Counſellers of whom they take aduice, were good Huſbands, and had the wit and wiſedome how to vſe their thrift, and how

to beſtow their own ſubſtance: for he that cannot rule and gouerne matters pertaining to his owne ſubſtance, will neuer be able well to rule other mens things. There was once a certain Gentleman, which being very vnthriftie, yet thinking his deſerts great, requeſted the Emperour Charles the fift, to pleaſure him with an Office in his Treaſurie, that he might haue the ouerſight &amp; gouernment of ſuch matters as did belong vnto the rents, reuenewes and ſubſtance of his Maieſtie. The Emperour anſwered, that he knewe he well deſerued to haue him doo him a pleaſure, but yet neuertheleſſe, if he ſhould grant him that requeſt, he ſhould giue all the world occaſion to talke: for ſéeing he knew not how to vſe his own ſubſtāce, he ſhold much leſſe know howe to rule &amp; gouerne the ſtore of the whole Common-wealth. But to return to the purpoſe: that the Counſellers of Princes may according to their duetie, ſerue their Princes well and faithfully: it is conuenient, that as wel thoſe▪ that be learned and lettered, as they that be craftie &amp; ſubtile, ſhould haue a good, a pure, a ſound, and a ſincere conſcience, and that they ſhould be (as our Lord and Sauior Jeſus Chriſt teacheth)Math, 10. wiſe as Serpents, and innocent as Dooues: for it is not profitable for the Common-wealth, that Princes ſhould haue ſuch men to their Counſellers, as be ſubtile &amp; malicious. And if this be manifeſt, that all Common weales be conſerued by Religion and true worſhipping of God, no doubt but they will be better conſerued (as Laurentius Grimaldus ſaith) if Princes admitLib. 1. de optimo ſenatore. learned and vertuous Prelats to their counſels, vnto whō our Lord and Sauior Jeſus Chriſt committed the charge of Chriſtian ſoules, the adminiſtration of his holy Sacraments, and the deliuering and preaching of his word, that they might with their zealous prayers, and ſupplications, continually requeſt and beſéech the Lord, to augment and conſerue the Commonweale publique. And if the Romans, Grecians, Egiptians, and all other Nations, which ſerued the deuill and worſhipped Idols, did admit their Prieſtes vnto their counſels, and gouernment of their▪ Common-weales: by what great reaſon then, ought Chriſtian Princes in the gouernment of the Common-wealth, to take counſell and aduiſe of the Prieſts of God, and the MiniſtersSanſouinus de dict

counſels of Princes, becauſe they did repreſent the Eccleſiaſticall eſtate, which was the foundation of all Common-weales: and becauſe that (the Prelats being in the counſels of Princes) all matters which in them were handled, might be diſpatched to the ſeruice and glory of God.

                     ELius Lampridius affirmeth, that it is better for the Common-wealth, that the Prince ſhould be naught, &amp; the Counſellers good, then the Prince good, and the Counſellers naught. For a great deale ſooner is one changed by the example and counſel of a great many, then a great many by the example and counſell of one. And for this cauſe the Counſellers of Princes ought to be vertuous, of good behauiour, honeſt in life, and eſtranged from all couetouſneſſe, and humane pretences: louing the Common-wealth and their King, whoſe authoritie and eſtimation they ought to make account of, aboue all other worldlie things. This which Elius Lampridius ſaith, holds in thoſe Princes, that folow that, which their Counſellers aduiſe them to doo: and not in thoſe, who will haue that their Counſellers ſhal approoue and allow all whatſoeuer they ſay, o

And by this meanes, euerie Prince ſhould haue Counſellers, that would haue a regarde of his eſtate, and publique profit of the Common-wealth.

(béeing informed that ſome of his Captaines which he admitted to his counſell, had giuen foorth ſpéeches, how that they did not fréely open their minds vnto him, becauſe they feared, leaſt if they ſhold haue vttered any thing cōtrary to his humor, he would haue béen offended with them) tooke occaſion to talk with thoſe of his Counſell, &amp; among many other things which he mentioned vnto them, tolde them that one of the greateſt ſins which men might commit againſt God, and their Prince, was▪ not to make him acquainted with their opinions, and not freely to ſhewe him what they thinke concerning that, about which they conſult. For ſo, they offend the Lorde, in that they denie the iudgment and vnderſtanding, wherewith it pleaſed his diuine maieſtie, to endue &amp; enrich them: and againſt their Prince vndoubtedly they commit a kind of treaſon. And becauſe men erre more often through mallice then ignoraunce: thoſe cleane, vnſpotted, and free counſails, which God inſpireth, are better, ſafer, and ſurer, then thoſe that are giuen vnto hope of

gaine, or ſome other vngodly pretence, and reſpect of feare, loue, or anger. For men commonly, by reaſon of ſome perturbation, or indignation and wrath, wherewith they be mooued againſt others, knowe not what they doo, and like men diſtracted and rauiſhed of all their ſences, doo all things ouer-thwartlie, and otherwiſe then they ought. Iſocrates counſelleth thoſe that willIn

For ſo by thys meanes, they ſhal vnderſtand, what is beſt and ſafeſt for them to doo, and that ſecret which they would not haue to be diſcouered, ſhall be concealed. This which Iſocrates counſelleth ought to be done by thoſe that are noted &amp; reprehended in ſome thing, if the qualitie of the matter ſo permit: propoſing it vnto them that find fault with them, as if they aſked counſell of thē aboutIohan, de Bayros decad. 2. lib. 2. cap. 7. it. This coūſell was vſed by Don Franciſco de Almeida, knowing that his Gentlemen▪ found fault with him, becauſe he wold not aſſault the Cittie of Aden, after that he had ouercome the Armies of Camori, of Calecut, and Melique ayas.
               
               3 Of this which we haue breefelie noted, foloweth neceſſarily, that it is farre better and more profitable for the Common-wealth, that the Prince ſhould be good, and the Counſellers naught, then that the Counſellers ſhould be good, and the Prince wicked. For all men endeuour to imitate the Prince. Plato with great iudgment and prudence (as Tullie ſaith) writeth,Dialog, 4. de legibus. Lib. 1. Epiſt. fam. that as the Princes be, ſo the Subiects proue. If ye Prince be vertuous, euery man doth his beſt to become vertuous, and if the Prince be vicious, they be all vicious. If the Prince be an hypocrite and ſuperſtitious, they

be changed by imitating the Princes, who hurte all them that folow their example, with which they d
                     ••
                   a great deale more harme, then they doo with the ſinne which they commit, for no man dareth to tell them the trueth. For which thing, we are much beholding to Dame Flatterie, who preuaileth ſo greatlie with Princes, that the ſame which out of all queſtion is good, is miſliked, and the ſame which is notoriouſly knowne to be naught and wicked, is allowed and approoued.
               Princes are now of long time accuſtomed to heare falſe tales, and to be flattered, and to haue all, whatſoeuer they ſay and doo, allowed and praiſed: that the greateſt Monſter which can be ſhewed to a Prince, is to tell him ſome true thing which offendeth him, as if he had neuer ſeene or heard any ſuch thing. And this is the cauſe wherfore Monſters offend, for if they had béen ſéene, they had neuer offended.
               4 Princes then, ſeeing howe neceſſarie it is, that they ſhould haue vertuous and learned men in their ſeruice, which might counſell and ſhew them, how they ought to rule and gouerne the people which is committed to their charge: ought to conſider, that both the credite and diſcredite of their owne perſon, and of all their Subiects alſo, dependeth vpon the election of their Counſellers. We ſée commonly that men iudge of the Prince &amp; his abilitie, according to the reputation of his Counſell. For if his Counſellers be wiſe, and in all points ſufficient men, then is he alwaies accounted wiſe. For it is no ſmall argument of wiſedome in a Prince, to be able to knowe and diſcerne wiſe and ſufficient men from others, and to chooſe them that are faithfull &amp; loyall, to be his Counſellers, leauing thoſe that be vnſkilfull and rude. But when the Counſellers are not learned, prudent, and rare men, it is impoſſible that ye Prince haue a good reputation. For he erreth in the principall point, if he chooſe inſufficient and bad men to be his Counſellers. And it is in a manner neceſſary, that he who erreth in a matter of moſt great importance, muſt alſo erre in all other things whatſoeuer. For if the Fountaine be infected, all the water muſt neceſſarily be alſo infected: euen ſo, if the counſell be corrupted, all the gouernment of the Common-wealth goeth to wrack. If a Prince haue good Counſellers, though he doo amiſſe, yet will no man beléeue it: but if his Counſell be not good, though we

ſée the Prince doo well, yet can we not beléeue it, or we thinke that it was doone by chaunce. By this may we perceiue, that a Prince who hath truſtie and loyall Counſellers, doth thereby not onely obtaine good ſucceſſe in his enterpriſes, but alſo great credit and reputation, both among his owne Subiects, and alſo among ſtrangers. His own Subiects loue and obey him, ſtrangers feare him, and all men ioyntlie with one voice ſingularlie commend him.
               5 Euery Prince ought to thinke, that a learned Counſel is more neceſſarie for him, then the bread which he eateth: to the end he may heare the trueth. For Princes cannot abide to heare the ſimple and naked truth, by reaſon of the multitude of flatterers, which compaſſe &amp; enuiron them on euerie ſide. Neither is it good that euery man ſhould be ſo bolde as to tell the Prince the trueth: for ſo they might incurre danger, to looſe their kingdoms and authoritie, and be had in no account.
               The royall Prophet Dauid, to ſhewe that all men honouredPſalme. 17. and reuerenced him, ſaid, that they all lyed vnto him. For they that are of power and authoritie, no man dareth to tel them the trueth: but to poore men that are of ſmall power, euerie one ſpeaketh fréely and boldly.
               If a Prince haue many Prouinces vnder his gouernment, he ought (as we haue ſaid) to chooſe Counſellers out of euery one of the places that are vnder his ſubiection, and not out of one or two onely: for the people taketh it very impatiently, to ſée that they be, as it were excluded, and caſt off from the adminiſtration and gouernment of the Common-wealth, ſeeing not one of their Countrimen to be of the Counſell: and they think (and that with great reaſon) that the Prince maketh but ſmall account of them: or that he taketh them to be ſlaues &amp; bond-men, or that he thinketh them not woorthy to be truſted. The firſt ingendreth hatred. The ſeconde ſéeketh libertie, and therefore they conſpire againſt the Prince, and confederate with ſtrange Kings. The thirde emboldeneth them to admitte any kinde of treaſon againſt their natural Prince.
               When a Prince chooſeth a Counſeller, he ought not to be contented with thoſe onelie that dwell in his Pallace or Court, nor of thoſe that are his owne Countrimen, nor of thoſe which he knoweth by ſight or by heareſaie, although they be neuer ſo

wiſe and prudent: but he ought to be well enformed of all ſuch as liue in any of thoſe Prouinces which he ruleth, and among them all, to make election of him that is well known, and ſufficiently prooued to be the beſt of thē all. Neither ought a Prince to make too much haſte in chooſing of his Counſellers, but to take leyſure and time enough, in conſidering and learning the ſufficiencie of all ſuch as ſhall be named vnto him. Willinglie hearing, and attentiuely waying all informations giuen vnto him: ſome fauoring thoſe that are named, ſome making againſt thē. To conclude, he ought not to elect or chooſe any one Counſeller, before he haue throughlie examined his abilitie and ſufficiencie: making choiſe of ſingular Lawyers to gouerne theCuj at obſeruat. lib, 7. cap. 12.

                  WHen the Romans ſerued and worſhipped Idoles, and Images of Heathen Gods, they built the Temple which they conſecrated to the God of counſell: in ſuch order, that they which went to worſhip him, ſhould goe downe a certaine payre of ſtaires, to deſire him that it would pleaſe him to vouchſafe and ſet them in their waie, and guide them in that they would doo. And this was doone after this manner, to let men knowe, how neceſſarie it is for him that aſketh counſell, to ſubmit himſelfe vnto the iudgment and opinion of thoſe, of whom he demaundeth counſell. The Church was not verie cléere, to ſhew that counſell ought to be kept very ſecret: and yt no man ought to knowe what is handled or treated of in it. For oftentimes men coniecture what is determined in the Counſell, if they know about what the Counſellers conſulted. So that men commonlie vſe to ſaie: tell me what Counſellers there were, and vpon what matters they ſate, and I will tell thée what was concluded.
               2 Lycurgus would not haue, that the houſes wherein theyPlutarchus in vita Lycurgj. of the Counſell entred to conſult within Lacedaemonia, ſhould be

magnificentlie and ſumptuouſlie builded. For he thought, that theſe exteriour and outwarde ſhewes of magnificence and brauerie, were nothing neceſſarie vnto Counſellers for to vſe prudence and iudgment: but that they did rather hurt &amp; endomage the moſt excellent gifts of the mind, making men either abiecte and effeminate, debaſing their courage, or els proude and arrogant, and mooued with ſuch vaine and ſuperfluous buildings. For continuall experience teacheth vs, that when men méet or aſſemble together in ſome gorgious place or ſtatelie Hall, moſt ſumptuouſlie and coſtlie built and ſet foorth: then they ſpende the time in looking vpon the comelie building, or in beholding the Images engrauen and carued in the walles, the cunning pictures artificiallie painted on the entries and doores, the ſtatelie Pillers erected vp a meruailous height, and of wonderfull thicknes, and in viewing the curious workmanſhip of the Roofe. And ſo, as well they that come into ſuch ſtately places to giue counſell, as they that come to take counſell, buſie theyr braines, and employ all their ſences in thoſe friuolous thinges, looſing that which is woorth a great deale, for that which is worth little or nothing.
               This which Lycurgus ordained in Lacedamonia, (whichPlato in Alcybiade, 1. Common-welth was not adorned and decked with many magnificent ornaments, and gorgeous furniture, though it was verie welthie and puiſſant,) taketh no place in thoſe famous andXenophon de Cyri minoris expendi, lib, 6. rich Common-welths, in which ſuch magnificence is vſed. For it beſéemeth ſuch Common-wealths, that the houſes in which the Senators and cheefe Gouernours enter, to conſult vpon matters concerning the eſtate of the Realme, be anſwerable to the magnificence and greatnes of the ſame Commonwealths.
               They that cauſe Schooles to be builded for thoſe that learn, ought to follow Lycurgus his ſaying: erecting them in places that be not delightfull or pleaſant, ſo that there be nothing in them, to allure and withdrawe the eyes of the Schollers from their Bookes, which maketh them nothing attentiue to heare that which their Maiſters read vnto them.
               
                  Plato (as S. Ierome and S. Baſil affirmeth) did chooſe outMaiſilius Fiſcinus in vita Platonis. a place in Athens to teach, which was neither delectable nor wholeſome: becauſe he béeing hard, &amp; of a ſtrong temperature,

the place ſhoulde not hinder his imaginations and thoughts, which neceſſarily ought to be frée, and not occupied in ſuch recreations, delights and paſtimes, which would haue hindered him from contemplation and ſtudie. The great Turke hath a window couered with a greene vaile, or Curtaine of ſilk, forth of which window, he ſéeth and heareth all that the Baſſaes ſaie and doo, when they aſſemble together in the houſe of Counſell. And thus béeing neither ſeene nor heard of the Baſſaes, he harkeneth to all what they ſpeake, and heareth the mones of thoſe that complaine. And the Baſſaes and Turkiſh Counſellers, not knowing whether the Turke be harkning behind the window, or no, dare not but deale iuſtlie with thoſe that come thether for iuſtice, or ſpend the time in vaine talke, which tendeth not to the ſeruice of their Lord. Some Counſellers were woont to commaunde, that the doore of the Counſell-chamber ſhould be left open, becauſe no man ſhold ſtand behind the doore and harken what they ſaid.

So did the Cranes (as Plinie ſaith) in Aſia, when they aſſembled together in the night time in theLib. 1, cap. 23. place from which they ſhould depart, out of that Countrey into another, killing the Crane that came laſt of all. In Fraunce alſoIdem Tamara vbi ſupra. in ancient times paſt, if any man made any ſtur in the place of counſel, there came incontinently a Sergeant vnto him, with a naked ſword in his hand readie drawne, who menaced him to ſtrike if he helde not his peace. And if he left not talking at the third threatning, the Sergeant cut his cloake in ſuch order, that the reſt that was left did him but little ſeruice.
               4 As often as the Emperour Fredericke called his Counſellers,Papa Pius lib. 3 de dictis et factis Alfonſi regis. to conferre with them about matters concerning the Common-wealth, he vſed to ſay. I would to God that it would pleaſe him to doo me ſo good a turne, that whē my Counſellers enter into the Counſell houſe, they ſhould caſt of counterfaiting and diſſimulation, and all fained pretenſes at the very gates and doores of the Chamber, in which they enter to counſel. And if I am not deceiued, it is ſufficient if they leaue but onely one thing, to wit, their owne priuate commoditie: for this is it

which ouerthroweth and deſtroyeth all counſels: and for looue of this, men faine and diſſemble: which deceitful practiſes, vndoubtedlyL, 30.

But (as Titus Liuius ſaith) the loſſe of the Common-wealth neuer gréeueth vs, but ſo farre as it toucheth the hurt and domage of our owne goods and ſubſtance.
               5 When the men of Galacia would conſult vpon matters of great waight and importance, they vſed a moſt abhominable cruell, and deuilliſh ſacrifice. They ripped vp ſome one mansIdem Tamara, vbi ſupra. breaſt with a ſharpe ſword, and by the ſpilling of the bloode, or the tearing and vnlacing of his members, they geſſed and diuined of that which ſhould happen, concerning thoſe things about which they conſulted. In a certaine part of the kingdome of Perſia, they vſe this. When they that dwell in that Countrey goe to aſke counſell of the Prieſtes, vpon that which they determine to doo: the Prieſts hold in their hands the booke, which is commonly called the booke of Lots or Fortune, and according to that which they find written in that booke, they anſwer them that come to conſult with them. It ſéemeth that the Booke of Lots or Fortune, wherewith they deceiue the ignorant Comminaltie, was brought out of Perſia: wherefore the Inquiſitors did with great reaſon forbid the ſame Booke of Fortunes to be read, that they which are of little vnderſtanding, might not be deceiued by it.
               6 Séeing that counſels, and the ſucceſſe of thoſe thinges which are conſulted, proceede, (as we haue ſaide) from the holie Ghoſt: it is conuenient, that all Counſellers before they beginne to conſult, ſhould humblie requeſt and beſéeche the holie Ghoſt, with great deuotion and humilitie, to direct them in their way, and leade them in their conſultations, ſaying that ſeruice which is properlie belonging vnto the holie Ghoſt. And if the ſhortnes of the time permit it not, they ought to ſing the Himne of the holy Ghoſt, as it is rehearſed in the Church, Come holie? Ghoſt &amp;c. And unitating King Dauid,

For it is he, that by the means of the Angels, ſheweth vnto vs what we ought to doo. For this is an euerlaſting truth, confirmed with perpetuall experience, that in the moſt harde and difficult things of all mans life, where the wit of man is moſt blind, and doth moſt want counſell and forces: there dooth the diuine wiſedome of the Lord, ſhew it ſelfe moſt cléerely &amp; wonderfullie.

For it is a token &amp; ſigne of great weakenes and ignorance in a man, to doo all matters according to his own wiſdome and humane counſels. It were better and ſafer, to deſire the Lord that he wold be our guide in all our actions and counſels: for he will direct vs in the readie path, &amp; ſhew vs which waie is beſt, ſéeing that he neuer fayleth to aide thoſe yt powre forth their praiers vnto him.

               7 And the better to bring this to paſſe which we ſaie, we ought to doo according to the commaundements of our Sauiour and Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who neither deceiueth himſelfe nor can not deceiue them vnto whom he giueth counſell. For from him floweth the ſpring of vnderſtanding and knowledge, and he is the author and cauſe of all goodnes. From him doth it proceede that Counſellers be good, &amp; he is the cauſe why Kings gouerne their kingdoms well, and miniſter iuſtice. And this did KingProuerb, 8.

And no doubt, ſeeing the holie Ghoſt is he that beadeth vs in all our actions: he will chooſe that for vs, which ſhall beſt pleaſe his holines.

And for becauſe yt when a man is not withdrawne from his booke, neither by his buſines, nor by any other meanes, it greatly confirmeth his memorie, and profiteth him much for the inuention and contemplation of that which he ſearcheth and learneth: no doubt, but the quiet &amp; ſtill night, which cutteth of all occaſions that may hinder a man, is the fitteſt, and beſt time to ſtudie in: eſpecially, becauſe the minde at that tune is more frée, and readier to muſe and conſider of euerie thing.
               9 Firſt of all before the Counſellers beginne to conſult, they ought to ſée that no man be in place, that may heare that which is ſpoken off in their conſultations. After that the Ambaſſadors of King Tarquinius, had conſpired with the SonnesPlutarchus in

And to doo this, they

aſſembled together in a deſert houſe, where no body did dwell. But as it fell out by chaunce, a certaine. Seruant called Vindicius, was in the ſame houſe, who ſéeing them enter in on the ſuddaine in great haſte, could not gette

King of Tolido, Went into the Kings Orchard, and eſpying the King comming thether to walke and enjoy the pleaſure of the Garden, beeing accompanied with his Noble men and Counſellers, he hid himſelfe behind the Arbour where the king was woont to walke in, that he might heare what talke there ſhold be had between the King and his Counſellers. The king being come, and hauing his Counſellers by him, he aſked them whether they thought, that the ſame Cittie of Toledo beeing ſo great, and ſo ſtrongly built, might be taken of the Chriſtians, or no. All of them anſwered, that it was impoſſible, that ſuch a ſtrong Cittie ſhould be ouercome by Chriſtians: except one, that was of opinion that it might be taken, if the Chriſtians ſhould burne their Corne, and barre them from receiuing any fruite of the lands about them, for the ſpace of ſeuen yeres: and ſo they ſhould be compelled to render vppe their Cittie into the handes of the Chriſtians, vnleſſe they would ſuſtaine hunger and famine. And after the King of Tole do had ended his talke, he chaunced to looke on the other ſide of the Arbour, where he eſpied Don Alfonſo the King of Caſtile, lying▪ on the graſſe, as if he had beene a ſléepe. Which thing he tooke verie gréeuouſly, fearing leaft he had hearde all their talke: and to try whether he ſlept, they caſt melted lead in his hand, which pearced quite through: and for this cauſe he was called, El de lamano horadada, that is, he of the hand-bored through. He was alſo called ſo, becauſe he was verie francke and liberall.

Which thing béeing told vnto Alexander, he cōmaunded that Lyſimachus ſhould be caſt without a weapon, to be deuoured of a fierce Lyon. But he like a noble and couragious Knight, wrapped his cloake about his arme, and without any feare at all ſtepped to the Lyon, and thruſting his hand into his mouth, caught holde of his tongue, and pulling it out of the roring Lyons heade, killed him. For which acte, Alexander eſtéemed much of him, and did not onlie pardon him, but alſo largely rewarded him, aduauncing him to great honour.
               3 Out of that which happened to Caliſthenes, may cléerely be ſéene, that the ſame is true which Euripides the Greeke Poet ſaith. I ſet little by that wiſe man, that hath no wit for himſelfe. Theſe be they that take vpon them to giue counſaile to euerie one, and can giue themſelues none: not much vnlikeHoratius Fungar vice cotis acutum redere quae ferrū valet, expers ipſa ſecandj.

               This is ſaid of the Hearneſhaw, becauſe the Pigion hauing built her neſt vppon a tree, and béeing threatned by the ſubtile Foxe that he would eate her, if ſhée woulde not conſent to giue him part of her young ones, the Hearneſhawe tooke pittie on her, and counſelled her to giue the Foxe none, ſaying: that ſhe ſhould not diſcourage herſelfe, nor feare the Foxe, for he could not clime vppe to the trée where ſhe was. So that the Pygeon

after that time, wold giue the Foxe nothing: who aſking why? ſhe anſwered, becauſe ye Hearnſhaw had told her, that he could not clime vp to the Trée, and therefore counſelled her to giue him no more. The Foxe vnderſtanding this, went to yt Hearnſhawe, and began to praiſe his wiſedome, ſaying, that of all byrds, none could gouerne their liues, and liue ſo wiſely as he: and among other matters, he aſked him how he was woont to doo when he would ſléepe? The Hearneſhaw anſwered, that he laid his heade cloſe to his bodie, and couered it with his wing, and ſaying ſo, ſhewed him the manner how, and put his heade vnder his wing: then the Foxe ſtept neere, and on the ſudden tooke him, and did eate him. And ſo the Foxe did verilie according to Euripides the Greeke Poet, his ſaying:

               5 Manie ſubtilties and craftie pollicies muſt be vſed by them that will ſaie the trueth, vnto one that is not willing to heare it. And as the Phiſitions prepare their purgations with ſirrops, and gild their pilles, leaſt the Patient ſhould be mooued and offended with the bitternes of them, euen ſo it is neceſſarie, that his mind ſhould be prepared vnto whom we mean to tell the truth. For the trueth dooth no leſſe mooue and offend where it is told, if he vnto whom it is told be not prepared, thē any medicine whatſoeuer, if it be giuen out of time and ſeaſon. And therefore the truth may not be told vnto all men, nor at all times, nor in euerie place. And when the trueth is tolde, weHypocrat, Aphoriſm. ought to conſider, who, where, when, how, and vnto whom he telleth it: (as the Phiſitions regard &amp; perpende all the circumſtaunces of the diſeaſe, to cure their Patients,) and if it be not ſo doone, in ſtéede of dooing them good vnto whom it is tolde, it maketh them worſe, and cauſeth them to abhorre and deteſt thoſe that tell it.
               The trueth ought to be told vnto Princes, with due honour and reuerence, as the Prophet Nathan did vnto King Dauid: and the Prophet Daniel, when he declared the Dreame of theCap. 4. Trée vnto King Nabuchadnezzar, ſaying vnto him: My Lord, the Dreame be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof vnto thine enemies. Iohannes Franciſcus Lotinus (whō
                  Conſidera. 319. we followe in this diſcourſe) ſaith: that when Counſellers

doubt vpon any thing, and their opinions be diuers, they ought not to croſſe or gain-ſay them that are of a contrarie mind, leaſt they ſhold ſéeme more curious in defending theyr own opinion, then carefull for the common profit. It is therefore conuenient for Counſellers to accuſtome themſelues, patiently to heare all that which in the Conſell is ſaide or ſpoken: and not to ſpende the time in declaring and expounding their own opinions, and contrarying that which other Counſellers alledge. For manie men in conſultations, are more like to Maiſters, that read and diſpute in Schooles, then Counſellers that conſult what ought to be doone.
               6 If the counſell which is giuen, be manifeſtly knowne to be good, no man ought to care whether he that giueth it be vertuous or vicious: for that counſell which without doubt is prooued to be good, ought alwaies to be preferred. But this ought in all counſels to be conſidered, whether he that giueth the counſell, regard more his owne particular profit, then the commoditie of the Common-welth: for by how much the more counſels are frée from all reſpects of priuate commoditie, by ſo much the more are they profitable vnto the Common-wealth.

               7 If it happen that in counſels, ſome Counſellers gaineſaie that which others ſay, and alledge the contrarie, then they whoſe opinions are croſſed, ought not to thinke yt they doe it becauſe they hate them, or make no account of them: but becauſeL. Item

               14 They which conſult about any matter, ought to follow that counſell which is leaſt hurtful to the Common-welth. for it is impoſſible in great enterpriſes to be deliuered from all dangers that are like to fall. And for this cauſe it is commonly ſaid:

                     Periculum periculo vincitur.
                  
               
               One danger is wonne by the other. As wee haue in the beginning of this Treatiſe in more ample manner declared. And he that neuer dooth aduenture, can neuer looſe nor gaine. For after the danger commeth the profit: and cowards becauſe they greatly feare the euents of matters, neuer atchiue haughtie enterpriſes. If a man thinke that he may execute a thing without aduenturing, he ſhall neuer bring any thing to paſſe. For many times the ſucceſſe faileth, not onely of thoſe things which we confidently, and not without good reaſon hope for: but alſo of thoſe things which we thinke to haue wel prouided for, as well in great and honorable enterpriſes, as in ſmal and particular actions. They therfore that cōſult, ought not to delay the execution of the ſame which is cōcluded, becauſe there is danger in it: if the profit be greater then the danger which is like to follow after the execution thereof.

Beſides, they conſulted in banquets vpon matters concerning peace and warre: becauſe they thought that at ſuch times they were not troubled with other cares, &amp; they thought that at ſuch times, they were hotter and readier to take any enterpriſe in hande. The people were not craftie nor malicious, and the next day after they turned againe to conſult vpon their affaires, that they might conclude and determine what they ſhould doe, when as they could not faine or inuent.

The ſame King of Fraunce, brought the Armie of Soliman King of the Turkes to helpe him in thoſe warres, which he made againſt the Emperour Charles the fift, and thereby did Chriſtendome farre more harme, then he did good to the kingdome of Fraunce.

               18 The Counſellers of Princes, ought in ſuch manner to

ſay their minds, that they ſéeme not to contende in wordes, but ought to ſéeke and pick out waies and meanes, which they ſuppoſe to be more fitte, and better to perſwade that, which they thinke to be profitable for the Common-wealth. Some vppon ſubtiltie, though they knowe what ought to be doone, and what is beſt and moſt profitable: yet they propoſe it after ſuch a maner, as if they doubted of it, to the ende that they which heare them, ſhould not ceaſe to enquire and examine what were conuenient to be doone, and that if they happilie ſay any thing, they might contrarie them, and croſſe that which they alledge.

For thoſe counſels are well giuen, that are vttered with leyſure and iudgment.

Math. 7. that which moſt belongeth to the maieſtie of a Prince (as the Emperour Theodoſius ſaith) is to be ſubiect vnto that which the Lawes ordaine. The King Antigonus ſaide, that no diſhoneſt &amp; vnlawful thing, might be lawful and honeſt to a Prince: for though he be a Prince, yet is he not diſpenced withall, but 
                     •••
                  ht to behaue himſelfe according to yt lawes of nature, which ſhew how men ought to liue honeſtlie one with another, without hurting their neighbors, contenting themſelues with their owne, and not offering any iniurie vnto another, which they would not haue others to offer vnto them. And within this diuine precept (as our Sauiour and Lord Jeſus Chriſt teacheth vs) be the Lawes and Prophets included. This rule &amp; doctrine which our Lord and Redéemer gaue vs, is ſo plaine and cléere, that it needeth not any gloſſe or expoſition at all.
               21 They that conſult vpon any matters, iudge better of that which others counſell, then they doo of that which they counſell themſelues. For euerie man is ledde by nature, to like well of his owne opinion and ſentence: becauſe his iudgment is not ſo free to iudge of his owne matters, as of a ſtrangers affaires. And for this cauſe, ought euerie one that writeth bookes and pamphlets, to ſhew them to their freends before they commit them to the preſſe: that they may fréely ſhew their minds, what they thinke ought to be chaunged, and what to be corrected: for no man can iudge aright of thoſe works which he maketh himſelfe, becauſe the loue which he beareth to himſelfe, and all what he dooth, doth blind him, and ſuffereth him not to miſlike with any thing that is of his owne dooing. And therfore it is commonlie ſaid, that the firſt thing which a Child dooth after it is borne, is that it maketh the father fonde: for it doth in ſuch manner blind his eyes and iudgment, that he thinketh his child to be a great deale fairer then all other children. As the Ape béeing aſked of the Fore, how he might knowe her young ones if he ſhould chaunce to méete them, that he might ſpare them, anſwered: that they were the faireſt that he could find. Who going into the fielde, found them, and did eate them, for they ſéemed not ſo faire vnto him, becauſe he looked not on thē with the ſame affectiō which their mother did beare vnto them.
               22 When one giueth counſaile to men of ſimple vnderſtanding,

vpon a matter concerning the Common-wealth: he ought not to alledge many reaſons, which may bring them into ſome confuſion, and ſtay them from giuing their reſolutions. For when they be (as it were) dulled, with the confuſion and multitude of reaſons: they be hindred frō executing that, vnto which their naturall inclination doth pricke and entice them.
               The Emperour Charles the fift, ſaid, that the Counſellers of Princes, were ſpectacles to that Prince that lacked wit &amp; vnderſtanding, to iudge of ſuch reaſons as were alledged vnto him: he ſaid furthermore, that thoſe Princes which could not ſée without thoſe ſpectacles were not very wel: but they were worſe, that could not ſée neither without them nor with them. And the Counſellers of Princes, are not onely the ſpectacles through which they ſée, but alſo ye looking glaſſes in which Princes behold what is doone in theyr abſence. Euery Prince therfore, ought to knowe and vnderſtande, whether they repreſent the right and true Image of that which they ſhewe: for there be certaine hollowe looking glaſſes, which ſhewe a thing quite contrarie, and otherwiſe then it is in deede: for ſome glaſſes make a little thing ſeeme bigge, and ſome make a great thing ſéeme little: and againe, ſome glaſſes make one thing to ſhewe as if there were a great many. All theſe differences and many more, which the perſpectiue Arte teacheth vs concerning looking glaſſes, are found in Counſellers of Princes, who informe not their Princes truelie of all that is doone. And therefore it is moſt neceſſarie for a Prince, to enquire and learne, whether his Counſellers of whō he taketh counſaile vpon matters concerning the Common-wealth, be pure and cléere looking glaſſes, or whether they be falſe glaſſes repreſenting a thing otherwiſe then it is, and whether they ſéeke colours, to make that which is blacke ſeeme white, and white to ſhewe as if it were blacke. For thus Painters doo, and thoſe Counſellers that imitate them.
               23 There be ſome Counſellers, that are ſo proude and arrogant, and that take ſuch delight in their own ſayings, and in hearing themſelues ſpeake, that they knowe not howe they ſhall conclude, or with what periode they will ſhut vppe theyr ſpeech: often repeating that which they haue ſaid: not becauſe they might be the better vnderſtoode, but to féede their humour

with the pleaſure which they conceiue in their owne wordes, and as S. Gregorie ſaith, to be accounted men of ſingular eloquence.Lib. 26, cap. 18 In Iob. But Eccleſiaſticus teacheth the contrarie, ſaying, make not many wordes, when thou art among the Elders, neither repeate a thing often. And King Salomon counſelleth vs, to cō
                  prehendEccle. cap. 10. many matters in few words, and not to ſpend a great companie of words in vttering a fewe thinges.
               
                  Phocion one of the chéefe Gouernours of Athens, ſaid, that that was the beſt kind of ſpeech, which in few words contained much matter: for words are like money, which is accounted ſo much more precious, as in ſmal quantitie it containeth greater price and value. And ſome men are ſo enamoured with theyr owne words, that wen they thinke they haue ſpoken brauelie, they aſke, whether they haue not ſpoken out of the purpoſe, not becauſe they doubt whether they haue or no, but becauſe they would be praiſed. The beſt and ſureſt thing that one may doeSanct. Grego. lib. 10. cap. 1. Iu Iob. in conſultations, is to come with all ſpeede to the verie point of the matter it ſelfe, and ſtraight waies to reſolue what ought to be doone, without ſpending much time, in alledging reaſons, which ſerue to no other purpoſe, then to ſhewe that they be eloquent. It is an eaſie matter (ſaith Titus Liuius) for one to findLibro. 8. out wordes and reaſons, after he knoweth what ought to be doone.
               24 They that in conſultations conſider and forecaſt but few things▪ ſhall eaſilie be reſolued: and they that reuolue many things, ſhall neuer be able to determine. We haue of olde had this prouerbe in Caſtile.
                  
                     Quien todo lo miro,
                     Nunca con boyes aro.
                  
which is to ſaie,

                     He that forecaſteth all the ſtormes of th'ayre,
                     With Oxe and plough the land will neuer care.
                  
               
               So that they which conſider all doubts, forecaſt all euents, and thinke vpon all the inconueniences that may happen, are neuer like to conclude and determine: and though they doo determine, yet doo they very ſeldome put the ſame in execution which they haue agreed vpon. But they that are nothing ſcrupulous, and paſſe euery thing ouer lightlie, hauing no regarde what inconueniences may fall out, they doo eaſily conclude many matters, but put few in practiſe. And to ſhunne theſe two

inconueniences, Counſellers ought to chooſe that, which they thinke to be moſt profitable for the Common-wealth: and not, as it is commonly ſaide, of two inconueniences, to chooſe the leaſt; for there is no choiſe of good, in ill thinges: and oftentimes,Hieronimus de an▪ in moralib▪
                   when a man ſhunneth the greater inconuenience, he auoideth both.
               25 The time ought not to be ſpent in counſailing, vppon that matter which is alreadie diſpatched; vnleſſe ſome thing happen concerning the ſame, which doth require, that ye Counſellers ſhould conſult vpon it againe. Cato Vticenſis (as Plutarch
                  In politicis. ſaith) when he knewe, that that thing which was handled in the Counſell, would be hurtfull to the Common-wealth, he did driue out the time in declaiming: and once prolonged his Oration ſo long, till that Iulius Caeſar, (who was Conſull at that time) aſked him when he would make an ende, and ſhewe what he thought, concerning that about which they conſulted. But he ſpent the time without concluding any thing, touching that which Iulius Caeſar demaunded of him. Then Iulius Caeſar commaunded him to be put in priſon, becauſe he would not make an end, and let him vnderſtand his minde &amp; opinion, concerning that which he aſked of him; and all the Senatours aroſe out of their places, and accompanied Cato, till he came to the priſon. Which thing Iulius Caeſar ſéeing, cauſed him to be ſet at libertie. Manie alleage all the inconueniences that may happen, concerning that matter which is conſulted: to the end, that while they deliberate vpon it, the oportunitie may paſſe, which was offered to haue it put in execution. The Emperour Charles the fift, ſaid, that the Parliaments in which the Germans

               26 Proſperous euents, cauſe men oftentimes to iudge ill of a thing: for when it hath ſucceeded proſperouſlie once, or twiſe, they thinke that it will alwaies fall out after the ſame manner. The ſame happeneth vnto them, that to reuenge ſomeLiuius, lib. 30. little iniurie, or to ſhunne ſome ſmall danger which they feare, they are ſo blinded, that without conſidering the perrils which may folow, by dooing that which they determine to do, although

they be tolde what were better, yet they will not heare thoſe which counſaile thē: and one little affection can preuaile more with them, then all the reaſons that may be offered, be they neuer ſo forcible. So that we commonlie vſe this Caſtilian prouerbe.

                     Hombre determinado,
                     Nunca bien aconſeiado.

               They therefore that conſult, ought to be frée from affections, that they might fréelie without any paſſion, ſée and coniecture what may fall out, as if they had it preſent before them: and if they doo this, they ſhal ſée whether they haue any reaſon in that which they pretend.

               27 When they that are of a contrarie faction or partialitie, giue anie counſaile worthy of reprehenſion, their aduerſaries ought not to rebuke them, leaſt they which heare them, thinke they doo it more for ill will which they beare them, then for loue or affection towards the Common-weale. Moreouer, Counſellers, if a matter fall not out according to their expectation, they ought not to reprehend the Princes whō they ſerue, becauſe they folowed the worſt counſaile; for ſo dooing, they ſhould gréeue them worſe: and in déede the Princes are blameleſſe; for they doo but follow the counſaile which their CounſellersPlutarch. in trac-tatu quo pacto. poſſis adulatorē ab amico dignoſcere. giue them. Anctus and Eulus (being two of the King Perſeus his verie familiar freenos) as long as he liued in proſperitie, vſed no croſſe ſpéeches againſt him, but ſuch wordes as

                  Lewes de Grauado ſaith) ought to be conſtant in mind: for as grauitie and waightines in matters accompanie prudence, ſo facilitie and lightnes betoken follie: and therefore euery one ought to take great héede, he be not too eaſie and light in theſe ſixe things: to wit, in beléeuing, in graunting, in promiſing, in determining or concluding, in being eaſilie &amp; lightly conuerſant among men, and in béeing angrie. For in all theſe conſiſt manifeſt danger, if men be ouer light and eaſie in them: for he that beléeueth eaſilie, is light of hart: he that promiſeth eaſily, looſeth his libertie: he that doth grant eaſilie, doth often repent: he that doth lightlie determine and conclude, putteth himſelfe in danger to erre and doo amiſſe: (as King Dauid did in Mephiboſheth,

               29 Plato exhorteth them that goe about to perſwade anyIn Politicis. thing, which is neceſſarie or profitable for the Common-welth, to imitate the Muſitions, who when they finger the ſtrings of their Lutes, to make ſome harmonie or muſick, they doo it ſoftlie and ſmoothlie, without any force or violence: he exhorteth them alſo, not to vſe cunning &amp; artificious ſpéeches, nor ſpeake ſharplie or craftilie, but ſincerelie and truelie, and that theyr words be agréeable to honeſtie and iuſtice, vſing graue ſentences fitte to perſwade.
               30 Such men as haue alwaies had proſperous lucke, and good ſucceſſe in their affaires, can verie ſeldome giue good counſaile, as Hanniball tolde Scipio, in the parlie which they had,Tit. Liu. lib. 30. cōcerning ye peace which the Carthagineans were about to make with the Romans: &amp; to perſwade him to it, Hanniball alleaged,

that Scipio was a young man, and had alwaies had good lucke, and that they which had neuer béen croſſed with ill fortune, did verie ſeldome conſider, and forecaſt all vnfortunate euents which might fall out. For the vertue of counſailing well, proceedeth from experience: and they that haue tryed aduerſitie as wel as proſperitie, are better able to iudge of both, then they which neuer haue béene vnfortunate: and they which haue no experience, cannot giue counſaile ſo well, as they that haue deliuered themſelues out of trouble and aduerſitie.
               31 Many though they be olde in age, yet in manners, behauiour, and prudente, they be but young: and ſuch men areEſay, 65. Puerj

               32 They that counſaile Princes, ought not to vſe words and reaſons, which beare a greater ſhew then they be of force: for he that goeth about to perſwade a Prince, muſt thinke that he taketh another matter in hande, then if he ſhould perſwade the people: for they that perſwade the people, ſéeke all means, arguments, and reaſons, (though they be neuer ſo falſe) to prooue that which they goe about, and they vſe all the figures that Rethorick teacheth. But to perſwade one man (as Quintilian
                  Lib, 1, cap. 3. ſaith) eloquence little auaileth. Antigonus king of Macedon, ſaid vnto one ye went about to perſwade a certaine thingEraſmus in Apo. libro. 4. vnto him, with painted words and ſophiſtical reaſons: thinkeſt thou to talke vnto me, as if thou ſpakeſt with the people?

               33 Counſellers ought to doo like the Phiſitions, and giue no counſaile, before they know vppon what thing counſaile is demaunded, and what ought to be doone concerning the ſame. For as it is not enough for the Phiſition to know the diſeaſe,

vnleſſe he alſo knowe what medicine ought to be giuen: ſo the Counſeller, though he knowe what is conſulted, that ſufficeth not, vnleſſe he alſo vnderſtand what ought to be doone therein. So that it is a thing moſt neceſſarie for a Counſeller, to haue notice of that which is handled in the counſell. For no man can giue counſell in any matter, concerning mans life, vnleſſe he haue both ſcience and experience, touching that which is conſulted. But when Counſellers are acquainted with ye ſubſtance of the matter, and vnderſtand it throughlie, then may they eaſilieFacile erit explicatis cōſilijs accommodare rebus verb a. Matth. cap. 1. Aphoriſmo, 1. Quintil. li. 2. c. 14 giue their reſolutions: and (as Ti

                     us ſaith) find fitt words to deliuer their minds: contrariwiſe, if they vnderſtand not the matter which is conſulted, they are (as our Lorde and Redéemer Jeſus Chriſt ſaith) like blinde men that leade the blinde. Neither is it ſufficient (as Hippocrates ſaith) for the Phiſitions to be acquainted with the infirmities, and knowe what remedies ought to be applied, but alſo the time, and other more circumſtances ought to be conſidered. And no leſſe ought Counſellers to regard and conſider, that all circumſtaunces of time, place, &amp;c. be accomodated and fitted, to execute the ſame which ſhall be determined. Moreouer, ſéeing that all thinges vpon which counſaile is taken, are vncertaine, and voyde of all firmnes and ſtablenes: counſails ought to be baried and changed, conformable to the time and place, not onely euery day, but euery howre alſo, and euery minute, when neceſſitie ſhall require it. And for this cauſe it is ſaid, Sapientis eſt mutare conſilium: it is the point of a wiſe man to chaunge his counſaile. Seneca faith, that counſaile ought to be taken whilſt the matter is handled. And Ouid ſaith:

                     
                        —Conſilium reſque locuſque dabunt.

               34 Some Counſellers are ſo ambitious, that they will not conſent to any counſaile but their owne: and wil not ſuffer any other mans counſaile to be put in practice, though it be neuer ſo profitable for the Common-wealth, ſtaying and delaying the execution thereof by all meanes poſſible. And whereas they might atchiue both honour and glory, by bringing the ſame to paſſe which is concluded, they will not: onely becauſe it was not doone according to their own counſaile and liking. But ſuch

men knowe not, that the true glorie of heroycall enterpriſes, dooth not onelie conſiſt in knowing what ought to be doone, but alſo in executing that which is determined.
               35 They that conſult vpon matters concerning the Common-wealth, ought not to forgoe any profit that may be gotten: no not ſo much as that cōmoditie which may be gotten by ſuch men, as haue greatly endomaged the Common-wealth. Chabrias a Cittizen of Meſſala, ſaide vnto one Euridanus, (a man cheefe &amp; principall in the gouernment of the Common-welth, but very ſullen and rigorous in nature. O Euridanus, thou art a neceſſary euill in the Common-wealth: for they that liue in it cannot chooſe but be conuerſant with thée, and yet becauſe of thy frowning and lowring countenaunce, they cannot abide to continue with thee.
               36 Plutarch counſelleth them that goe about to perſwade the people to any thing, that they ſhoulde not all of the at once, ſing one note, but that there ſhould be diuerſitie of iudgments at the firſt, but afterwards (as if they were ouercome by them that ſhewed better reaſons) they ſhould agrée all in one opinion, and all iumpe, as it were, into one mind. For ſo the people, thinking that they were forced vnto that vnitie of conſent, will ſoone be perſwaded, that that which they ſay, is moſt profitable for the Common-wealth. But in ſmal matters, and ſuch as cannot greatlie endomage the Common-wealth, it were good that the Counſellers ſhould in earneſt differ in their cenſures, one from the other, euery one vſing his own reaſons and arguments, that they might afterwards in greater matters of more waight and importance, ſeeme to agree, and be all of one mind. This pollicie did many Hereticks vſe, ſuborning ſome of theyr freends that ſhoulde gaineſaie that which they ſaide, and afterwards when they did diſpute with them, they ſhoulde confeſſe that they had erred in miſliking their doctrine, ſéeing they had with ſuch forcible arguments and neceſſary concluſions proued and confirmed it vnto them.
               37 There is much difference betwixt thoſe that in counſailes enquire what ought to be doone, and thoſe that contrarie and croſſe other men, to ſhew that they onely vnderſtande all themſelues, and that no man els is ſo fine headed as they be. For they that enquire of all circumſtances, concerning that

thing about which they conſult, conſider and ſift the matter throughlie without affection, and their iudgment is not incumbred with any thing that may hinder them from diuining and coniecturing ſuch accidents, as may happen in thoſe matters vppon which they deliberate: and theſe men are very good and neceſſarie in a Common-wealth; for they oftentimes ſhew vnto them that gouerne it, ſome thinges, which before that time haue laine hidden and ſecrete from them. But contrarilie, they that contrarie thoſe that propoſe any thing in counſell, loue not the Common-wealth, but hinder and ouerthrowe all affayres both publique and priuate: for whilſt they alterate &amp; contende,Nimis altercando veritas amittitur, &amp; Plato, Dialogo, 1. de legibus. Oportet autem non contentioſe ſed quieté rem inquirere. they cannot finde out the trueth of any matter, but rather (as Boaecius ſaith) they goe farther from the trueth: for it is the propertie of thoſe that gaine-ſaie euery thing which others alleage, to defend and maintaine their own opinion and conceit, thought it be neuer ſo falſe and hereticall. Otherwiſe if men diſputed, minding to ſift out the trueth, and not to ouerthwart other men in their reaſons, they might eaſilie perceiue and vnderſtande the veritie of each matter. And to this ende were theSanctorum Patrum diſputationes non erant contentiones ſed collationes. diſputations of the holie Fathers called, not contentions or differencies, but collations and conferencies. For their intent was not to ſhewe which of them was wiſeſt, and knewe moſt, but to ſearch out the trueth of that which was in queſtion.
               39 The Counſellers of Don Iohn Prince of Auis, (whoChronica Duci

And on a time, as the Prince conſulted with his Counſellers vpon a matter of great waight, all they that were of hys Counſell, miſliked that which Don Nunaluares alleaged, concerning that which was propoſed, which thing, whē 
                  Don Nunaluares perceiued, and marked to what intent they did it, be laughed: and the cauſe of his laughter being aſked of ye Prince, he anſwered: becauſe they haue all of them agréed, to diſagree from me, and to withſtande and contrarie what ſoeuer I ſaie. But the Prince liking that counſaile which Don Nunaluares gaue, folowed it, nothing reſpecting yt all his other Counſellers were of a contray iudgment. This thing ought to be ſhunned▪

               39 Some men eaſilie varie and change, when they ſitte in counſaile: others be very obſtinate and ſtiffe, and will not varie at all. Certes it were good that a Counſeller ſhoulde be grounded and ſetled in his opinion, and follow that which ſéemeth vnto him, to be moſt profitable for the Common-wealth. But he that will not change his mind, when as his counſaile, if it were folowed, would doo the Common-wealth much harme, is obſtinate, ſelfe-willed, and ſtubborne: and is not to be admitted to giue aduice vpon matters concerning the eſtate of any Common-weale. For wiſedome conſiſteth not in being ſelfconceited and ſelfe-willed, but in knowing how to make choyſe of that which is beſt and moſt profitable: for it is the propertie of the deuill, to perſeuere ſtill in dooing ill: and therefore we vſe to ſay.

                  In lib, partit. Conſideratio. 355. ſaith, that in all counſailes, that ought to be choſen, which is moſt profitable for the Common-wealth. This opinion dooth Iohannis Franciſcus Lotini folow, becauſe he thinketh yt 
                  Tullie followed it, when he was olde, after he had ſéene the euent of manie publique affaires: and becauſe Ariſtotle concluded the end of counſaile, to be the vitilitie and profit of the Commonwealth. This opinion of Tullie, is confirmed with that which the Lawes of the twelue Tables ordaine, to wit, yt the cheefe ende of all Lawe, tendeth to the conſeruation of the Commonwealth. The vttermoſt end and iſſue of the Law is, the preſeruation of the Common-wealth. When men deliberate vppon the ſafetie of the Common-wealth, they ought not to regarde honeſtie, but ſetting aſide all reſpects, they ought to folow that which is profitable. They which defende the maieſtie of theyr Kings and Lords, wil not ſuffer anie one to ſaie, that any thing which the King hath graunted or allowed, is ignominious, infamous, or vnhoneſt. For they ſay, that no inſamie, reproche, or diſhonour, can fall into any determination which the King approoueth. But I take that opinion, to be of more waight and moment, which holdeth, that wee ought to make more account of honeſtie, then of vtilitie: but if that which is honeſt, depend vpon the Ciuill and poſitiue Lawes, and not vppon the naturall and diuine Lawes, let all the Ciuil lawes ceaſe, when as the neceſſitie of the Common-wealth is ſo great, that it can not be remedied vnleſſe they be broken. This holdes in thoſe Common-weales, which acknowledge no ſuperiour: and in thoſe alſo which do acknowledge one, if they onely violate thoſe Lawes which they may break, without the hurt or hinderance of their Superiour: for all the humane and poſitiue Lawes, which are inſtituted and ordained for the conſeruation of the Common-wealth, ceaſe, if they be hurtfull and domageable to the Common-welth. Titus Liuius termeth thē mortal Lawes, for warres change thoſe that were made for peace, and peace breaketh thoſe that were made for warre.

                  ced openlie, nor knowne vnto all men. They that were of the

Counſell, anſwered, that he ſhould make Ariſtides acquainted with it, and if he approoued it, they would euery one like of it: vpon this, he ſhewed vnto Ariſtides, how that he had determined to fire their enemies Shippes, that they béeing conſumed with vnlooked-for flames, the Athenians might be abſolute Lordes ouer all Greece. Ariſtides
                   hearing this, tolde the other Counſellers, that Themiſtocles his counſaile, was very profitable, but very vniuſt; whereupon they woulde haue no more mention made about it, and that with great reaſon. For whenſoeuer any queſtion is mooued concerning the ſoule &amp; ſubſtance, or riches and authoritie: it is moſt manifeſt, that the ſoule is better then the whole compaſſe of all the world: and it ought not in any caſe to be permitted, that learned flatterers ſhouldFranciſcus Villalobos in prob. be admitted to ſuch counſels. For theſe men are they that vſe to iuſtifie both parts, &amp; by reaſon of theſe, each ſide thinketh that he doth according to iuſtice. Frauncis King of Fraunce, did owe vnto the Emperour Charles the ſift, two Millions of crownes, and the learned men of his Counſell told him that he ought not to paie them: which counſaile the King no doubt had folowed, if the Emperour had not had his two ſonnes as pledges for his aſſuraunce. On the otherſide, the learned men of the Emperors Counſell, ſaid, that the King of Fraunce ought to paie thoſe two Millions of crownes, becauſe he had waged warre againſt him vniuſtlie, and was taken priſoner in the ſame conflict: and all thoſe crownes were in compariſon nothing, to the loſſe and domage which the Emperour had receiued by thoſe warres. But the King of Fraunce coulde not be perſwaded, but that hee had right according to his Counſellers mindes, and forthwith, ſent a ſtrong and mightie Armie towards Naples, where he loſt out of his own treaſure, aboue ſire millions of crownes, and al the treaſure of Fraunce, with all the youth of his Nobilitie, and all theyr Captaines: and at the ende neuertheleſſe, hee was conſtrained to paie the two millions of crownes.
               42 Silence at all times, and in all places (as Plutarch

                      auditoris. ſaith) is a great Ornament vnto a Counſeller: eſpecially whē he heareth another ſpeak, he ought not to interrupt his ſpéech, and at euery word which he faith, to cut him off and hinder his diſcourſe, but patiently to ſuffer him that ſpeaketh, to ſaie his minde, and make an end of his ſpéech, though it doe ouerflowe

with many words which be not very acceptable vnto him. And when he hath made an end, then ought not the other too haſtilie beginne, to gain-ſay or croſſe that which he hath ſaide: but ſtaie a while (as Eſchines ſaith) and ſée whether he will recall that which he hath ſaide, or correct it, or adde any thing more vnto it, or detract ſome thing frō it. They which incontinentlie interrupt and breake another mans diſcourſe, and doo ſo looſe their patience, that they cannot ſtay ye hearing of foure or fiue reaſons alleaged by another, but beginne to ſpeake before the other hath doone, they doo both trouble others, and yet cannot be heard themſelues. But they that be accuſtomed to heare an other giue his verdict, patientlie with ſufferaunce, and a quiet moderation of mind, admit and allow thoſe words and reaſons, that are good, profitable, neceſſary, and expedient, and kéepe thē in remembrance: but thoſe that are vaine, fooliſh, &amp; falſe, they ſeuer and diſcerne thē from the other: and ſo they ſhew themſelues to be more deſirous to ſearch out the trueth, then to contend and ſtriue, whereby they be known not to be men without conſideration, or ouer-raſhe and headlong haſtie, not contentious, or wranglers. Therefore he that will atchiue honour and credite, ought to heare him that ſpeaketh, attentiuely, méekely, willinglie, pleaſantlie, &amp; with great tolleration, as if hee were at ſome religious and ſacred banquet.
               43 Xenophon ſaid, that euen as they that be thriftie andPlutarchua

                     i ſupra. good huſbandmen, vſe to buy as well of theyr enemies as of their freends: ſo they that heare others, ought with great vigilancie and watchfulnes, alwaies to be attentiue to reape profitte by that which they heare, whether it be good or bad: and conſider whether they that ſpeake, ſay any thing which tendeth to the matter, or whether they be deceiued, and are wide from that which they aime at, whether they alleage forcible reaſons, or clatter out a heape of vaine arguments; and whether they vſe any good figure or laudable forme of ſpéech, ending their periods with ſome gracious clauſe, or commit ſome great abſurditie, whereby they thought to get ſome credit or vaine-glorie: or ſome ſuch other like thing. And this ought to be noted by the hearers, to the ende that they may conſider with themſelues, and examine their owne defects: for they cannot ſo wel marke faults in thēſelues, as they can eaſilie correct in others: which

when they find in others, they ought to conſider whether they iarre not in that ſtring themſelues, before they finde it a faulte with others. For certes it is an eaſie matter to rebuke, but a very vaine thing, and ignominious vnto vs, if wee be faultie our ſelues, and take not heede frō falling into the ſame errors: wherefore when we rebuke any one, we ought to thinke continually vpon that ſaying of Plato, haue not I perhaps committed any ſuch thing? and euen as in the eyes of other men, wes ſée the repreſentation of our owne Image: ſo ought we to imagine our owne words in the words of other men, to the end we ſhould not ouer-raſhlie diſpiſe others, and that we ſhould take more héede and diligence when we ſpeake our ſelues. Moreouer, it were very profitable and expedient, that Counſellers ſhould compare that which they heare others ſay, vnto yt which they ſaie themſelues: and attentiuelie conſider, whether they heare any thing that is not wel ſolowed by him that reaſoneth. And if he declare and expound it not, as wel and ſufficientlie as the matter requireth, then they ſhold themſelues endeuour to expound, and explane the ſame more cléerely and exactly, or declare it after ſome other order or manner, or take the ſame argument, and quite change it from the beginning to the end, vttering and pronouncing it in better words and fitter phraſes.
               44 They that aſſemble together to conſult, ought not to be proude, and puffed vp with vaine glorie, nor leane vppon any thing, bending their bodies on neither ſide, nor hang theyr heads, but ſitte bolt vpright, hauing ther bodies erected in comlie order, and giuing eare vnto him that ſpeaketh, in ſo much that hee may perceiue them which heare him to be attentiue: They ought moreouer to be conſtant, ſincere, pure, vncorrupted, ſimple, without diſſimulation, not puffed vppe with pride, hatred, or any other thing: in ſo much that they ought alwaies to be in a readines, and not to ſeeke what they ſhoulde ſay concerning thoſe things whereof they conſult. For as many things are required to make a man perfectlie vertuous, like as in Muſicke to make a conſorte, manie notes are requiſite which concurre altogether in one tyme within their limitted compaſſe: ſo contrarilie, if any one thing be wanting, the whole is blemiſhed: as alſo in Muſicke one iarre brings all out of tune. And therefore Counſellers ought to take great heede, howe they

behaue thēſelues in conſultations, eſpeciallie when they heare any other to diſcourſe: for then ought they not only, not to knit or hang the browes, nor to caſt their countenaunce downewards, giuing ſhew of ſorrowe, nor to gaze about, nor to turne their bodies, nor to hold their féete vndecentlie: but alſo, not to make ſignes, not to whiſper with another, not to laugh, not to yaune, not to nodde as they that be drowſie, and not to be rude in behauiour: for all ſuch like things are worthy of correction, and require great care &amp; diligence. And note this; that all that which we haue ſaide of thoſe that heare, ought alſo to be obſerued by thoſe that ſpeake. Furthermore, as in Tennice play, hée that receiueth the ball, ought to mooue and bend his bodie, cunninglie to bandie it backe againe to him that ſent it, ſo in reaſoning and diſcourſing, as well he that ſpeaketh, as hee that heareth, muſt do his part &amp; duetie, and dilligentlie obſerue what he ought to doo. So that Counſellers ought, whether they heare or ſpeake, to behaue themſelues orderlie in all reſpects; and take heede when they begin to ſpeake or diſcourſe of any thing, that they be not too tedious; for many, when they once beginne to talke, they neuer make an end.
               45 The Counſellers of Princes are ſubiect vnto two great inconueniences, The firſt is, that if they counſaile not theyr Princes to doo that which they thinke to be moſt profitable for the Common-wealth, without hauing any reſpect vnto theyr owne profit, or any other thing; then they diſcharge not their dutie. The ſecond is, that if they doo counſaile their Princes, to doo that which they will not doo, then they incurre daunger of their liues. And to ſhunne theſe inconueniences, the beſt and ſafeſt way for them is, to beware of both extreames, and folow a mean in euery thing: ſhewing their minds vnto their Prince with great modeſtie, concerning euery matter, (as that which toucheth nothing their own perſons) in ſuch order, that if the Prince follow their aduice, he may doo it willingly of his own accorde, that it ſéeme not that he is drawne or forced to doo it, by the importunitie of him that giueth the counſaile. And if the Counſeller doo thus, there is no reaſon why the Prince ſhould beare him ill will, or be highly offended with him: and ſo the Counſeller may auoide that danger, which els he ſhould incur, if in any thing hee withſtoode the Prince his pleaſure: or the

ſelfe-liking and opinion of the other Counſellers. For if the ſucceſſe be infortunate, euery one endeuoureth to diſpatch him which gaue the counſaile. So that in this caſe, when Counſellers counſaile their Princes modeſtlie (after the maner which we haue ſhewed) though they gette not that glorie which they obtaine when the counſaile falleth out proſperouſly: yet they haue two commodities, the one, that they be not ſubiect to anie daunger, the other, that though their counſaile haue no proſperous euent, yet they gette no diſcredite by it, but be rather in more account. And contrarilie, they that will be chéefe &amp; principall in the Counſell, and wil ſuffer no counſaile to be preferred before their owne, if their counſaile fall out vnhappilie, &amp; haue but had ſucceſſe, then they are rebuked, &amp; beare all the blame: and though it fall out well, yet the diſcredite and infamie which they procure when the matter dooth fall out infortunatelie, is greater then the credite or glory which they get whē al things ſucceede proſperouſlie.
               46 As they that are inuited to ſome banquet, muſt be contentPlutarch. de officio auditoris. with that whith is ſette on the Table before them, without aſking any thing els: euen ſo in counſels, they that heare another man ſpeake, ought to heare him with great attention: and not to mooue any doubts, or interrupt his ſpeech with vain queſtions: for all the profit that commeth thereof, is onelie to trouble him that ſpeaketh, and cauſe him to erre, and digreſſe from the purpoſe. And therefore they ought not to be troubleſome vnto them that are in the Counſaile, aſking them often about one and the ſelfe ſame thing: for ſuch (as Plutarch ſayth)Vbi ſupra. are like thoſe little byrdes, that cannot yet flie, and yet be alwaies gaping at other birds bils, to receiue theyr foode alreadie champed and chewed by them. To conclude, it is the point of fooliſh and ſimple fellowes, and ſuch as haue no witte, to be aſking of queſtions at euery word, and to be ſtill enformed vpon euery point.
               47 They that conſult vpon matters of great importaunce, ought to conſider, (as Cornelius Tacitus ſaith) whether thatLib, 18, which they determine vpon, be profitable vnto their Princes, and whether it may be put in execution, without harming or endomaging the Common-wealth. They ought alſo to conſider; whether they that giue the counſaile, are like to come into

into trouble if it fall not out proſperouſlie: and who ſhall gaine the credit and honour if all thinges ſuccéede happily. And aboue all, they ought to haue a regarde, what the people talke, if the Prince doo as they counſaile him; for though all other men vſe to follow thoſe counſailes, which are moſt profitable for them, though they be not altogether iuſt: yet Princes ought to doo nothing (as the Emperour Tiberius ſaith) that paſſeth the boundes of iuſtice: greatly regarding their fame &amp; reputation: and what would be ſaide of them, if they ſhould followe counſailes that were hurtfull to the Common-wealth.
            
            
               The thirteenth diſcourſe. Of the Counſell of eſtate, and of the ordinaunces and lawes that appertaine to the ſame Counſell.
               
                  THe Counſell of eſtate (as Plato ſaith) is the ankerDialogo, 12; whereon dependeth the ſafetie or loſſe of all the Common-wealth. For this Counſell looketh to the whole Common-welth: and (as Iſocrates ſaith) it is the ſoule thereof: and it isIn Areopagitico. like to prudence in man, which hath a care of the eſtate of the whole bodie. All other counſailes depend vpon this one Counſell: and it is called the Counſel of peace, becauſe the cheefe and principall intent of this Counſell is, to procure that euery one may liue in peace and quietnes: for this is the ende for which the Counſell of eſtate was ordeined. For (as Plato ſaith) warres are not made for any other cauſe, then toDialog. 1. de legibus. procure peace. This Counſell of eſtate, doth oftentimes change the gouernments into tyrannies, and quite deſtroy the Common-weales: and, (as Heſiodus ſaith) one ill counſaile giuen by ſome wicked man, cauſeth the decay and ruine of many Citties: and therefore it is commonly ſaid, that all the welfare of the Common-wealth, lyeth all in all in the counſaile of eſtate. And becauſe in my Bookes of Common-weales, I writte of al the other Counſels in their proper places; I mean in this place to entreate of the Counſell of eſtate, which is (as the EmperorAdrianus Iunius animad verſ. lib. 3, cap, 9. 
                  Charles the fift ſaide) the knowledge, power, and vnderſtanding, yea, the verie eyes, handes and féete of euery Prince.
               
                  2 Fredecicus Furius ſaith, that the charge of the Counſell of eſtate, is Ciuill (as the Lawes terme it) and whether theIn libro de conſilio &amp; confiliarijs principum. kingdomes be gotten by force of Armes, or by inheritaunce, it is pertaining to the Counſell of eſtate, to ſée what Viceroyes, Gouernours, and Generals be created, as well for peace as for warre: what mariages be contracted, and what Embaſſadors be ſent into ſtrange Countries, and whither all other Officers diſcharge their duetie or no: and what prouiſion ought to be made and not made. The Counſell of eſtate ought alſo to take heede, that no prouiſions, voyages, and expeditions be made by ſtealth, to the domage of the Common-wealth, and commoditie of the enemie. It appertaineth alſo to the Counſell of eſtate, to ſée that all ordinarie expences &amp; charges, be diſcharged in due time, as well in peace as in warre, and to giue bils for the receite of the money out of the Counſell of ſubſtaunce and Reuenewes: which Counſell ought to be as a Coſfer to keepe the money, which is to be diſtributed and deliuered out, by ye Commiſſion and authoritie of thoſe that are belonging to the Counſell of eſtate. It is alſo belonging vnto this Counſel, to ſée with what Nations they ought to make peace, and againſt what Nations to wage warre: with what people they cught to be confederated, and with whom to vſe faire wordes and large promiſes, but accompliſh nothing, and ſuch other like thinges, publique or priuate. This holdes in that which generallie pertaineth to the other counſels: for if this Counſell of eſtate, ſhould meddle with euery particular thing that belongeth to the other Counſels, it ſhould vſurpe the Office of them all.
               3 The Counſell of eſtate, hath all iuriſdiction both Ciuill and Criminall. And what euer is determined in it, ought to be put in execution, as if the Prince himſelfe had commaunded it. For this counſaile aboue all others, dooth chéefely repreſent the perſon of the Prince: and for this cauſe the Prince ought to beLib. 1. cod. de officio Vicarij. perſonally in thoſe conſultations which are made in the Counſell of eſtate, to the ende, that nothing be ordained, which may harme the Common-wealth. So that euery Prince ought to conſult with his Counſellers, and with the learned men of his Realme, whether ſuch ordinaunces as he meaneth to publiſhe be good and profitable for the Commen-wealth. For there is nothing that is more contrarie to a good Prince; and proper to

a Tyrant, than to ſaie, Sic volo ſic i
                        •
                     beo; ſtat proratione voluntas.
                  
                     Thus I commaund, thus ſhall it be,
                     For reaſon, will, ſhall ſtand with me.
                  
               
               4 Séeing that in the Counſell of eſtate, it is cheefly conſulted what ought to be doone, for the preſeruing and maintayning of the Common-wealth it is neceſſarie that the Counſellers of that Counſell, be well practiſed and experienced in Militarie diſcipline, and very ſkilfull and prudent in ruling Common-wealths: ſo that they ought to knowe howe to enquire, examine, and iudge all things concerning pollicie and gouernment, both in peace and warre. Further more, they that conſult vpon peace, whither it he profitable, it ſhould be eſtabliſhed or no: ought to know what is belonging to war, ſeeing peace and warre he two contraries: and the nature of contraries is ſuch, that the one is knowne by the other. In auncient times paſt, many Senators entred into the Senate of Rome to conſult, and they that had triumphed for victorie ouer their enemies, ſate with the Crownes on their heads (which they wore whē they triumphed) as tokens and ſhewes of their vertue and excellencie. And this did Cyneas the Ambaſſadour of Pyrrhus declare, whē he béeing aſked of Pyrrhus what he thought of the SenatePlutarchus in vita Pyrrhj. of Rome, he anſwered, that it ſéemed vnto him to be a counſell of many Kings, that were aſſembled together to conſult. Liuie reporteth, that Cyneas in this aunſwere, ſhewed the greatnes and excellencie of the Senate of Rome, for in it were not onelie manie noble and famous Captaines, with thoſe Crownes on their heads, with which they triumphed, becauſe they had valiantlie ouercome their enemies, and ſubdued manie Princes to the Empire of Rome: but alſo many ancient perſons of great authoritie &amp; eſtimation, wonderfullie exerciſed in the gouernment of the Common-wealth.
               5 Thoſe ordinaunces and Lawes, that were made at theMacchiauellus in diſcurſibus. firſt beginning of the Common-wealthy, when men were good, afterwards whēanen became wicked, ſerued to no purpoſe: for the Lawes varie according to the accidents that happen in the Citties, but the ordinaunces are verie ſeldom altered. And thys is the cauſe that good Lawes ſuffiſe not, becauſe the ordinaunces remaining ſtable and inuiolable, doo diſanull them. There was in Rome, the ordinance of gouernment, or rather of eſtate;

and after wards the Lawes and Offices with which they bridled the Cittizens. The ordinaunce of the oſtate, was the authoritie of the people of the Senate of the Tribunes (for ſo the Protectors of the Commons were called in Rome) and of the Conſuls: and it was the manner and order howe the Lawes ſhould be ordained. Which ordinaunce is not change or al
                     ••
                  eb by reaſon of any accidents that may chaunce, but ſhe Lawes which keepe the Cittizens in obedience, they be altered: as the Lawes which were made for the conſtraint of adulterie, of exceſſiue expences, and ambition, and many other Lawes aceording as the people dailie grewe to be more &amp; more wiched and vicious. But becauſe the ordinaunces of the eſtate, which the people béeing corrupted) were not good, did remaine inuiolable: thoſe Lawes which were renued, did not ſuffice to keepe the people from wickednes: but they might haue doone-much good, if the ordinaunces had béene renued with the Lawes.
               6 We may eaſilie perceiue, that it is not good, to haue the ordinaunces remaine ſtable and inuiolable, when as the Cittizens ware wicked, by two principall things: the one touching the election of Officers, and ordeining of Magiſtrates: the other touching the eſtabliſhing of Lawes. There was an ordinaunce in Rome, that none might be Conſuls, or beare any other great Office in the Cittie, ſauing thoſe Cittizens that did ſtande for the Office, and made ſute for it. This ordinaunce at the beginning was verie good, for then no Cittizens ſued or ſought to beare Office, but ſuch as thought that they did deſerue to be in authoritie, and they tooke it for a great diſeredit to haue the repulſe, and therefore euerie one, becauſe they woulde be iudged and accounted worthy of that dignitie, endeuoured to be vertuous. But after ward, this ordinaunce became very harmfull and pernicious: for they that were moſt mightie, not moſt vertuous, ſued for the dignitie, &amp; they that were not mightie, though vertuous, for fear durſt not ſtand for the Offices. To this incō
                  uenience came it, though not in a moment, yet in continuance and tract of time, as all other inconueniences vſe to happen. For the Romans hauing ſubdued all Affrick and Aſia, and brought almoſt all Greece vnder their ſubiection, aſſured themſelues of libertie, and thought not that they had any enemies whom they needed to feare. Whith ſecuritie of theirs, and weakeneſſe

of their enemies, cauſed the people of Rome in the election of their Conſuls, not to reſpect vertue, but fauour: ſo that thoſe were placed in that dignitie, that wiſt better howe to entertaine their fréendes, then to encounter with their enemies. And after that, they which were moſt gracious had a prettie while borne the Offices, then they which were mightieſt, and coulde preuaile moſt, were elected to be heade Officers, ſo that honeſt and vertuous men, by the defect of ſuch an ordinaunce, were altogether excluded from the dignities, and prebeminences which chéefely appertained vnto them.
               7 Therefore to the ende that a Common-wealth may be maintained in her wonted libertie, it is neceſſarie that newe ordinaunces be made, to remedie that which the mallice of mē bath corrupted: for little profit the Lawes, when the whole ſubiect and bodie (as it were) of the Common-weale is ſo much diſordered, that they cannot poſſiblie ſette it in order againe. Some ſay it is well nigh impoſſible, that all ordinances ſhould be changed: for if they would diſanull them by little and little, it is neceſſarie that it ſhoulde be doone by ſome wiſe man that foreſeeth and perceiueth, what inconueniences might happen by reaſon of ſuch like ordinaunces, and thoſe men that are accuſtomed to liue after one manner and order will not alter that ordinaunce, eſpecially, becauſe they perceiue not the diſcommoditie thereof, vnleſſe it be ſhewed vnto them by apparent coniectures. Moreouer, if they woulde goe about to repaire the ordinaunces all in a moment, yet albeit euerie one eſteemed thē to be naught that yet would it be very hardlie brought to paſſe. For to vſe ordinarie meanes, (ſéeing they be naught) is not enough: but it is neceſſaire, that he ſhould come at laſt to extraordinarie meanes, to witte, violence and Armes: and before any other thing, to make himſelfe cheefe of that Cittie, that hee may chaunge all thinges at his will and pleaſure: and to eſtabliſh his Lawes and ordinaunces, it is neceſſarie he ſhold haue authoritie to ſuppreſſe them, that through enuie propoſe themſelues to gaineſaie &amp; contrarie them: for no man can hope that tract of time may confirme them, and his vertue and honeſtie that bringeth them in, ſufficeth not: and as for the fauoure of the people, that is variable: and wickednes and miſchiefe will not be appeaſed by any gifts or good turns, according to that.

To conclude, becauſe it is neceſſarilie required in the mutation, or rather reformation of a Common-wealth, that it ſhoulde be doone by a good man, and becauſe it is preſuppoſed, that he which maketh himſelfe Prince by force &amp; violence, is a wicked man, it chaunceth very ſeldome, that a good man will make himſelfe Prince by ill meanes, though his intent be good, or that a naughtie andCornel.

               8 All this diſcourſe (which is taken out of Machiauell) is grounded vpon this, that in thoſe Common-weales that be ruled and gouerned by many, they that rule and gouerne them, doo verie hardlie agrée one with another, in keeping and altering the old and auncient cuſtonies: and it ſeemeth that thys holdes in thoſe Common-weales, that are weake and gouerned by the counſaile of manie: who, though the inconueniences be moſt manifeſt and notorious: yet through their naturall imbecillitie, they knowe not, nor cannot tell howe to repayre them: But thoſe Common-weales that can renewe the olde rites and cuſtomes, can as well annihilate and diſanull thoſeGalen in lib. artis medicae, ca. 89 that be both bad and hurtfull, and as Phiſitions when they be acquainted with the cauſes of the diſeaſes, they take them away firſt, and afterward very eaſily cure their Patients, ſo it is conuenient, that they which gonerne Common-weales, ſhold as a neceſſary remedie, execute puniſhment on offenders, when men liue ſo corruptlie and wickedlie, that thoſe ordinaunces which at the firſt were good &amp; holie, cannot be innouated without bloodſhed and fire: which are the remedies with which God dooth cure the vices of men

                   as Phiſitions, when purging and letting of blood ſuffice not, vſe ſearing to cure the diſeaſes. They therefore that gouerne Common-weales, ought dilligentlie to ſearch out, whether the diſſolutnes of mens maners ſpringeth

heereof, that the accuſtomed Lawes are not good and profitable for the Common-wealth. And it is a great deale better to repaire them, by adding, chaunging, or diminiſhing, then by altogether deſtroying thē. But if humane mallice haue ſo corrupted them, that they cannot be bettered, but by baniſhment, confiſcations of goods, killing or burning, then muſt the verteHyppocrates. lib, 1. aphor. 6. vttermoſt and laſt remedies take place.

But theſe reaſons whith Bernard Campellus alleaged to perſwade the Lordes of Uenice, to bring in the Law which permitted none to continue in Office, ſéened not to be ſo requiſite, as that the former ordinauncés ſhoulde be cancelled by reaſon of them: and they that were of the Counſell of tenne, woulde not conſent, that ſuch a Lawe ſhould be propoſed in ye Senate: for they thought it wold be hurtfull for the Common-welth, to alter and abrogate thoſe Lawes, whereby their predeceſſors, béeing men of great prudence and ſingular wiſedome, had long time before gouerned and maintained it: and that it was not expedient to innouate thoſe ordinaunces which are belonging to the eſtate: becauſe men béeing naturally giuen to innouations, and oftentimes doo chooſe the warſt: if that they ſhold once permit the ancient ordinances, to be altred &amp; innouated: the Common-wealth ſhold neuer be frée from factions and diſſentions: and becauſe albeit it be daungerous to haue the Offices continue ſtill with the

ſelfe-ſame perſons: yet it is not ſo when there be many men in the Common-wealth, that are in as great power and authoritie as thoſe fewe that beare Office: and for this cauſe, though they would hurt and endomage the Common-wealth, they can not: and though they that▪ be choſen be but fewe, yet they be choſen out of many, and the greater companie, may more eaſily withſtand the leſſe.

Finallie, as the Phiſitions when they cure any diſeaſe, they varie and change the diet and phiſicke which they miniſter vnto the ſicke, according as it doth them good or harme: ſo they vnto whō the gouernment of Common-weales is committed, ought to leaue o

And as the Phiſitions applie their medicines &amp; remedies to the diſeaſes: ſo they that gouerne Cōmon-weales, ought▪ to puniſh and chaſtice the offenders and tranſgreſſors of the Lawes, both with mony and corporall paines.
               And for to remedie the inconueniences and harmes that are in a Common-wealth, it is not enough to chaunge the Gouernours of it, and chooſe others, if the fault procéed not frō them: and as the Ague is not driuen away by changing of the Phiſitions onely: vnleſſe others be founde that are more ſkilfull, and know better how to cure it then the firſt: ſo the vices &amp; harmes of the Common-wealth, are not taken away by chaunging the Officers and Magiſtrates, vnleſſe ſuch perſons ſucceede in the Offices, that know how a Common-wealth ought to be gouerned.

               12 If the gouernment of any Common-weale be altered out of one eſtate into another: as for example out of a Democracie into an Oligarchie, or out of an Oligarchie into a Monarchie, it is expedient, that the Lawes and ordinaunces of the eſtate be altered alſo. As Brutus did, when he caſt the kings out of Rome, and brought in the gouernment of the Conſuls, changing the kingdome into a Conſulſhippe: and ſo the Commonwealth was gouerned by two Conſuls, and the choyſe and election of the Magiſtrates was giuen to the people. So like wiſe the Romaine Emperors, after they became Lords ouer ye whole

Empire, by little and little altered and changed all the Lawes and ordinances by which the Common-wealth was gouerned, during the Conſulſhippe: accomodating and fitting the Lawes conformable to the eſtate which they woulde bring in: and vſe the Lawes as Phiſitions vſe medicines; for it properly concernethCap

And as the Phiſitions vſe not to cure al diſeaſes with one medicine, and apply not the ſame medicine at all times: but according to the ſtrength or féeblenes of the ſicke, and other circumſtaunces conſidered, varie and alter their remedies and phiſicke which they miniſter, and in many ſickneſſes they deferre the cure till ſome other time, rather then they woulde remedie them with manifeſt danger of life: ſo it is a great deale better, and more conuenient in gouernment, to diſſemble ſome thinges, then to goe about to mende them with the loſſe &amp; damage of the whole Common-wealth.
               This counſaile did Pompey the great thinke to vſe, in the warre which Iulius Caeſar waged againſt the Common-welth, and to maintaine that warre as Fabius Maximus maintained, the warre which Hanniball made againſt Italie. For in ſuch enterpriſes, and many other affaires, the time doth diſſolue and ouerthrow them: and to goe about to diſpatch and deſtroy them in haſte, were to ſpoile the Common-wealth.
               13 They erre greatly, that thinke that the mixed bodiesMachiauell' lib. 3. in prohemio diſcurſuum. of Common-weales be cured, by reducing them into their firſt originall: for ſéeing that the mixed bodies, are like to mens bodies, (which becauſe they increaſe and decreaſe, Children and babes ought to be cured one way, young folkes another waie, and olde men after another manner, conformable to their age and compl

It is therefore expedient, that they which gouerne Common-weales, change and

alter the Lawes and ordinances, by which the Cōmon-weales were ruled when they began, and ſquare them to the times in which the Common-weales increaſe, and become greater and larger. For a great Common-wealth cannot be conuenientlie maintained; with the ſelfe ſame Lawes and ordinaunces, with which it was maintained and gouerned, when it was but little, though notwithſtanding that it be ſaide, that Princes goe about to ſpoile and marre the eſtate, when they begin to break the old lawes and rites, and auncient cuſtomes, vnder which men▪ liued many yeeres: for this holds not, when neceſſitie requireth that the gouernment ſhould be changed, and ſquared to the preſent eſtate of the Common-wealth. And as the Phiſitions cutte or burne off one member of the bodie, to ſaue the ſicke mans life: and as the ſkilfull Pilot, caſteth the wares &amp; Merchandiſe ouer-boorde, to helpe the ſhippe out of the imminent danger: and as the Sheepeheard hath the charge ouer ye whole flocke to cure it: euen ſo it is conuenient, that they which gouerne the Common-wealth; ſhould conſider what vices and diſorders, diſquiet and trouble it. And euen as the dilligent and careful Labourer, taketh great pains in weeding his Gardens, and rooting out thoſe hearbes which are rather hurtfull then wholeſome vnto his groundes: ſo they that rule and gouerne Common-weales, ought to labour, clenſing them from all pernitious weedes of wickednes and naughtines, which hurt thē: for there is nothing more hurtfull, and leſſe profitable to the Common-wealth, then to ſuffer diſſolutnes of manners, and pernitious cuſtoms to encreaſe and augment dailie; which afterwards, moleſt and vexe the Common-wealth. And, to bind euery man to liue politicklie, and according to reaſon, as wel by rewards as by puniſhment, in euery Common-wealth. Parliaments be holden: in which the Eſtates being aſſembled together, conſult vpon all things that neceſſarily ought to be doone, for the commoditie, profit, and conſeruation of the whole Common-wealth.
               14 Ariſtotle is of this minde, that ſuch Lawes and ordinauncesPoliticor. lib. 2. cap. 6. as are profitable to the Common-wealth, ſhoulde not be altered, and that thoſe that are not very harmfull, ſhold not be abrogated: for if they ſhoulde ſtill be chaunged, altered, and renued, and haue no ſtablenes or firmitie in them, they be but

little accounted and eſteemed of by the people: for they thinke, that as ſome of them be changed, ſo they wil al be altered. And therfore they obey not the Lawes with ſuch reuerence and dutie as they ought to doo. This which Ariſtotle ſaith, ought to be obſerued▪ in the election of Officers and Magiſtrates, and all other things pertaining to the Common-wealth: not changing or renuing any Law or ordinaunce, which endomageth not theD. L. in rebus ff. de conſtitut. princip. Common-wealth: for the leſſe they be chaunged or reformed, the leſſe they be tranſgreſſed. As I writte more at large in my Bookes of pollicies and Common-weales, in the Treatiſe of Lawes and Law-makers. But if the Gouernours of the Common-weales, chaunge and alter one manner of gouernment into another, they ought to forecaſt and conſider with themſelues, whether that people, whoſe gouernment they goe about to aboliſh, are wonted and accuſtomed to liue in libertie, and whether they be priuiledged, and haue gotten the gouernment by ſucceſſion, or by lawe of Armes: for thoſe Princes find the people more louing and willing to obey, that continue in ſucceſſion of ſome eſtate, then they that newlie beginne the inheritaunce. Cornelius Tacitus ſaith, that it is expedient, that they whichLibro, 20. newlie obtaine ſome eſtate, ſhould vſe great liberalitie &amp; mercie, eſpecially, if the people be accuſtomed to be mercifully and curteouſly dealt withall. So that if Princes followe that counſaile which the Elders gaue vnto Roboam, deſpiſing the aduice3.

But thoſe ſubiects that be welthy &amp; well able, ought to ayde their Prince in the defence of the Cōmonwealth, and releefe of the poore and needie people, that haue beene oppreſſed with the gréeuous tyrannie of war. For, ſéeing

that, parte of the commoditie that is gotten by defending the Common-wealth; falleth to their ſhare, it is great reaſon they ſhould aſſiſt their Prince to ayde the Common-wealth, and deliuer it from out the hands of the enemie, putting him to flight and driuing him from their borders: and they ought not to excuſe themſelues, either becauſe they be exempted or priuiledged: for no ſuch excuſes are to be admitted in time of neceſſitie. But the Prince on the otherſide, muſt ſo moderately, and after ſuch order vſe them, that he doo not (as the Emperour Tiberius
                  Suetonius in Tyberio. ſaith) flea them, but ſhaue thē: and ſéeing that the cauſes wherfore we be chaſtiſed, ill dealt withal, deſtroyed, and vexed with warres, famine, diſſentions and plagues, are common: (for we are all ſinners, and in many things we greatly offende againſt the Lord: and perchaunce they that thinke themſelues blameleſſe, are moſt faultie) it is great reaſon that euery one ſhoulde ioyne with the King, and beare a part of all the troubles and charges with him: ſéeing that not ſo much as our Kedéemer and Lord Jeſus Chriſt, nor all the Apoſtles, denied to pay theirMatth. 17. part vnto the Magiſtrates: if not for right, and becauſe it is due, yet bothe becauſe the Common-wealth ſhoulde not be diſquieted, and alſo with their example, to encourage and ſtir vp others that be better able to doo the ſame.
               15 Very ſmall faults, and ſuch as are not ſeene at the firſt, are more dangerous then greate faults: for that danger whichLotinus in conſiderationibus. is knowne, cauſeth men to ſéeke meanes to auoide it: but that which is not knowne, groweth ſo much by little and litle, that when it is knowne, it cannot be remedied: and it is like vnto the diſeaſe called Febris ethica, which when it beginneth, a man feeleth or perceiueth not any harme: but when it is come ſo farre that he knoweth it, no medicine can cure it. And thys doth proceede, by reaſon that men commonly conſider, only that which they ſée: and that which at the beginning ſeemeth to bee but a ſmall thing, and altogether vnlike to become anie thing hurtfull: growing by little and little, at length waxeth verie domagable to the Common-wealth: which may be eaſily ſéene in thoſe aſſemblies and congregations where many meete together in ſecret, which at the beginning ſeeme not to threaten any great harme: and yet at the length, when they are fullie growne and augmented, they wonderfullie diſquiet the Common-weales,

And thoſe Preſidents ſhold enquire and examine, what men gathered into thoſe companies. For the people beeing like to the Sea, which by any wind is ſoone mooued, they that aſſemble together whē oportunitie ſerueth, they diſquiet the Cōmon-wealth.

And if they conſent and agrée with them, then they lay all the faulte of ill gouernment in them: ſo that their liues, honour, credite and eſtimation, is ſubiect to the will and pleaſure of thoſe, that rule naughtilie. And they that gouerne, béeing men of ſmall wiſedom, and knowing not what is belonging to the Commonwealth, meruaile greatlie how the matter ſhoulde fall out infortunatlie, whereas they might with greater reaſon maruell; how it ſhould fall out proſperouſly.

But they that were in authoritie, and did beare rule ouer, them: ſéeing that the Romaine Captaines offered thē great iniurie, in ouercharging them with too much tole and tribute (in the time that the forces of the Romaine Empire were deuided, by reaſon that the Emperors of Rome waged wars againſt diuers Nations) and whereas they ought to haue béene contented with the vnreaſonable tributes, which according to theyr owne pleaſure were paid vnto them: they were ſo vnwiſe, and dealt ſo vnaduiſedlie, that they did not onelie more and more continually ouercharge them, but alſo gaue them occaſion to aſſemble together, and ſéeke meanes to reuenge the iniuries which they offered vnto them, by chooſing olde and feeble men to be Souldiers, that they might pay money to be diſmiſſed, and preſſing faire boyes to ſatiſ-fie their execrable beaſtlines by abuſing them: whereuppon the Bataui determined to rebell againſt the Romans, and deliuer thēſelues from the iniuries and miſchieues that the Romaine Captaines did them: and chooſing a famous Captaine to be their Generall, they fought againſt the Romans and did them much harme: and ſo they did caſt off that troubleſome yoke of ſubiection, and recouered their former libertie.

Fortreſſe, Towne, or Caſtle, they may eaſilie recouer them againe from their enemies, if they can tell how to defend themſelues: as the Romans did, when they did driue Hanniball out of Italie, notwithſtanding that hee had poſſeſſed the Countrey, and had béene Lorde ouer it ſixteene yeeres long. And they did not onely driue him out of Italie, but alſo waged warre againſt Carthage, and ſent freſh Souldiers to their Arme which they had in Spayne, and denounced newe warres againſt King Antiochus. And they bought and ſold thoſe grounds, lands, and poſſeſſions which Hanniball had taken, for the ſelfe-ſame pryce that they were rated at before.

They therefore that gouerne eſtates, ought to imitate thē that playing at Cheſſe, looſe ſome one man or other, thereby to win the Game, and take the check to giue the mate. This is to be vnderſtood, if the eſtate haue ſufficient forces to defend it ſelfe; for if it haue not, it is better to make ſome honeſt agréement, (as our Lord and Sauiour Jeſus Chriſt teacheth vs) then to be quite deſtroied, and looſe all: as it happened to the renowned Cittie Ieruſalem, and other famous Citties, which by reaſon that their Gouernours did not knowe their weakenes, were ouerthrowne, and leuied with the ground.
               18 If they that gouerne any Common-wealth, think that to defend themſelues from their enemies, leaſt they ſhould be ſubdued by them, conſiſteth more in the forces that the Cōmonwealth hath, then in the particular and priuate goods of thoſe that liue in it, they are farre deceiued. For the goods haue their foundation in the Common-wealth, and if they doo not help it, both the goods and Common-wealth alſo goeth to wrack: euen as that bodie, in which each member onely procureth the conſeruation of it ſelfe. Therefore it is conuenient, that as eache member doth put it ſelfe into danger to ſaue the head: ſo thoſe that liue in a Common-wealth, ſhould aduenture both life and goods to defend her, ſéeing ſhe is the head of all them that liue in her. They ought moreouer to conſider, that many times Cō
                  mon-weales be ouerthrowne &amp; ſubdued by the enemie, becauſe

the Cittizens béeing rich, and the Common-wealth poore, they will not ſuccour and ayde her with their ſubſtaunce: and (as Titus Liuius ſaith) nothing greeueth them, but as farre as it toucheth their owne particular intereſt: for that is it that allIuuenalis ploratur lachrimis amiſſa pecunia veris. men moſt regard, and we find by experience, that men commō
                  lie ſet more by their ſubſtaunce, then by their credit and reputation: as may be ſeene in ye Noble men of Rome, who alwaies (without any extraordinarie diſpleaſure) ſuffered the profite of the Common-wealth to be preferred before their owne honour and credite; but concerning their wealth; they did with great vehemencie and ſtiffnes, reſiſt againſt the Lawe Agraria, (for the diſtribution of the Landes among the people) and wold not by any meanes permit, that it ſhoulde be eſtabliſhed: whereby they wrought the ruine and deſtruction of Rome: which began from the ſons of Gracchus, and continued thrée hundred yeres, till Iulius Caeſar tyranniſed.

But the Emperour woulde not doo that which the Marquis requeſted of him, becauſe he alwaies did more reſpect the peace of all Chriſtendome, then his owne profit: whereof he ſhewed a moſt liuely example in that he rendered the Dukedome of Milan vnto Frauncis Sforcia. To the ende that Common-weales may be maintained &amp; defended: they that liue in them, muſt conſider, that they cannot be ſaued, if the Common-wealth perriſh: and that it were better for them to ſpend their wealth, to maintaine the Commonwealth, then to be ouercome, and brought into captiuitie by the enemie.

But Nicolas de Cuſſano, (who béeing a man ſingularlie well ſeene in Ciuil affaires, liued at that time) ſéeing that the firſt fault was cōmitted, in not fore-ſéeing the dangers that might follow, by honouring and eſtéeming of Coſme de Medicis, hee woulde not ſuffer (whilſt he liued) the ſecond alſo to be committed; to wit, that the Cittizens ſhould intend, to take awaie the honor from Coſme vnto which they had aduaunced him: iudging that ſuch an intent, would be the cauſe of the deſtruction and ouerthrowe of the whole eſtate, as it afterwardes fell out: for the Cittizens that remained after he was deade, would not follow the counſaile which he had before giuen them, but gathered forces againſt Coſme de Medicis, and expelled him out of the Cittie, but what folowed? A while after, thoſe of the Cittie that were of his ſide, ſent for him, and made him Prince ouer the whole Common-welth: vnto which ſtate he had neuer reached, if the Cittizens had not publiquelie oppoſed themſelues againſt him. The ſame happened in Rome with Iulius Caeſar, who being fauoured of Pompey, and the other Romans for his vertue: afterwardes

became the deſtruction of the Romaine Commonwealth: of which thing Tullie beareth witneſſe, ſaying, that Pompey beganne to feare Caeſar too late: which feare vrged him to procure a remedie, and the remedy haſtened the deſtruction of the Common-wealth.

This baniſhment continued tenne yeeres: and their goods were not confiſcate, nor the fruites of theyr poſſeſſions were not gathered by any of the other Cittizens, whilſt they were abſent. And this kinde of baniſhment was vſed, becauſe ſuch men as were moſt rare and excellent among them, ſhould not tyranniſe ouer the Common-wealth, &amp; tranſlate the gouernment vnto themſelues.

profitable or hurtfull to the Common-wealth, was bounde incentinently to make the Magiſtrates acquainted therewith, who did publiſh it, if they thought it would be profitable for the Common-wealth. To be bréefe, it belongeth to the Counſellers of the Counſell of eſtate, to ſee that no ſeditions, contentions, and hurli-burlies ariſe in the Common-wealth: as the Counſellers of Cayphas admoniſhed, whē they did conſult how theyMatth. 26. might take our Sauiour and Lord Jeſus Chriſt.
            
            
               The fourteenth diſcourſe, touching warre.
               
                  BEcauſe the duetie, whereby a Prince is bound to rule and maintaine the people, which God hath committed to his gouernment, conſiſteth chéeflie in two things; to wit, in gouerning his ſubiects, according to the Lawes and ordinaunces of the Realme: and in defending them from their enemies, that they may liue in peace: and ſeeing that I haue in ye former diſcourſe entreated of the Lawes and ordinaunces of the eſtate: I mean in this to ſay ſome thing concerning the Counſell of warre.
               1 They that follow warres (as all men know) are alwaies in great daunger and troubles, and at no leſſe charges. And for this cauſe, no Prince ought to make warre, vnleſſe hee cannot otherwiſe chooſe: and vnleſſe hee cannot enioy peace without the harme of the Common-wealth, the loſſe of his eſtate, and impayring of his reputation. Otherwiſe, if a Prince can obtaine an honeſt peace of his enemie, vpon reaſonable and iuſt conditions, he ought not to wage war, but conclude that peace, to ſhunne bloodie battels, ſlaughters, ſpoyles, pillings, ſacrileges, and all ſuch other wicked actions, which are practiſed in time of warre. And if thoſe Princes that conſult, whether they ſhall wage warre or no, conſidered all the domages and harms that may ſuccéede by waging warre, they would neuer be reſolued to make warre: whereby they ſhoulde increaſe theyr enemies forces, and weaken their owne. Therefore incontinently after that they that are of the counſel of eſtate, haue concluded, that it is expedient for the profit of the Common-wealth, and ſafetie of the Prince, that warre ſhoulde be made againſt the

enemie. Euery one ought to determine fullie, either to ouercome, or to die in the enterpriſe: as a Woman of Lacedaemonia ſaide to her Sonne, when ſhe gaue him a Target to goe to warres: returne my ſon either with this Target, or els within it.
               2 Euery Prince that goeth about to make war, ought firſt to conſider whether he be able, and if he be: then whether the profit that is like to enſue, be greater thē the harme which may ſuccéede: for if the loſſe ſhould be greater then the commoditie, that would be (as Auguſtus Caeſar ſaide) as if one ſhould fiſheSuetonius Tranquillus in vita Auguſt. Caeſaris cap. 25. Imperatorem de bello conſultaturum, non ignorare opertet quam magnae ſint exercitus facultates &amp;c. with a golden hooke. He ought furthermore, dilligentlie &amp; earneſtly to enquire, what forces his enemy hath, and whether his own power and ſtrength be ſufficient to vanquiſh the Armie of his enemie, and ouerthrow it. And if he ſtand in doubt, and can not certainly be informed, whether his enemies forces or hys owne be the greater: hee ought to thinke, that his aduerſaries are better prouided, and more ſtronglie garded: that he may be the more dilligent, and the more carefull in perſecuting his enemies, and infirming their forces and powers: for many Captaines, becauſe they reſpected not their enemies, and made no account of them, were ouercome and put to flight. Furthermore, to examine, both his enemies forces, and his owne: he ought to knowe whether of them bothe, hath the greater ſtore of money, hée or his enemie: and howe long the warres are like to continue, and howe much money is neceſſarie to maintaine them.
               In this, great care and dilligence muſt be taken: for moneyClaudius Cotoreus de iure militum in prohemio, libro, 2. (as it is commonlie ſaide) is the ſinnewe of warre: which beginneth and endeth it: and for this cauſe, the Counſellers of Princes ought to enquire, whence prouiſion of money may be had: and howe they may bring to paſſe, that their enemies ſhoulde want. And howe needefull and neceſſarie this is, wee may manifeſtlie perceiue by this, that many enterpriſes haue beene giuen ouer for lacke of money to ſupply the charges of warre, as happened to Cleomenes, King of Lacedaemonia, with Antigonus King of Macedon.
               
               3 Princes ought to conſider what Captaines they chooſe for the warres: for if the Captaine, who is the guide to leade and conduct the Souldiours, be not valiant and prudent, then

muſt all needes goe to wracke. Tullie in his Oration, pro lege Manilia, ſetteth downe the perfect patterne of a good andIn oratione pro lege Manilia. valiant Captaine, ſhewing what quallities a good Captayne ought to be endued withall, to become famous; of which matter, I haue written verie largelie, in my Booke of the Office of Captaines and Generals.
               That the warre may in all points haue proſperous and good ſucceſſe, all men knowe howe important and neceſſarie it is, that the Captaines ſhould be hardie, valiant, couragious, and faithfull: for nothing can be more hurtfull in warres, then fearefull, cowardlie, faithles, and vnſkilfull Captaines. There ought alſo great care to be had in the preſſing of Souldiours, what men be choſen to ſerue their Prince in warre. For the Souldiours be they that muſt fight, and gette the victorie: and therefore, though the Captaines, Generals, and all other Officers, be neuer ſo perfectlie adorned, and endued with all heroicall vertues: if the Souldiours be baſe and cowardlike fellowes, the warres cannot be fortunatelie finiſhed.
               When Iulius Caeſar went to fight with Perreyus in Spayne, he ſaide that he went to ſeeke an Armie without a Generall: and when hee went to meete with Pompey, he ſaid: that heeSuetonius Tranquillus, in vita Iulij Caeſaris. cap. 34. ſought a Generall without an Armie. And therfore in the muſtering and training vppe of Souldiers, great dilligence ought to be taken in examining and enquiring, whether thoſe Souldiours that be preſſed for the Prince his ſeruice, be faithful, or Traytours to their Countrey and Prince, whether they be conſtant, or inconſtant and variable: whether they be newe and freſh-water Souldiours, or olde and experienced Souldiours, that haue long time beene practiſed and trained vppe in warres: whether they come of their own accord with a willing mind to ſerue their Prince, or be forced thereunto by compulſion: and whether they come for the loue they beare theyr Countrey, and obedience they owne vnto the Prince, or beeing baſe and raſcall fellowes, fetcht out of Innes, Tiplinghouſes, and other ſuch like places, they come to ſerue the Prince onelie for paye: beſides theſe, there are manie other thinges which ought to be carefullie conſidered in the preſſing of Souldiours: as I haue written more at large in my Bookes of Militarie diſcipline.
               
                  Furthermore, Princes that determine to ſette vpon theyr enemies, ought to enquire, what Harnes thoſe Souldiers haue, that are gathered for ſeruice in warres. For Souldiers that be well weaponed, fight with a more valiant mind, then they that are vnweaponed and lacke their harneſſe. And when ſouldiers are throughly well fenced with Armour of proofe, they be the more emboldened to ſet vpon their enemies, to aſſault Fortreſſes, &amp; to vndertake any kind of ſeruice. And many times ſome kind of weapons, are not ſo good and ſo apt to obtaine the victorie, as others: as may be ſéene by the difference of weapons, which the Lacedaemonians, Romans, and Parthians vſed. The Romans often vanquiſhed their enemies: not becauſe they were more valiant, &amp; more ſtrong or couragious then their enemies. but by reaſon of the oddes in fighting with better weapons. Therefore Princes ought alſo to enquire what weapons theyr enemies vſe in warre, and with what weapons they ought to Arme their owne Souldiers, to defend themſelues, and endomage their enemies. And alſo, what places are moſt fitte and conuenient to aſſault their enemies, and ſureſt for theyr owne ſafetie.
               4 They that mean to wage war with any Country, ought to knowe what freendes they haue to helpe and aſſiſt them, eſpeciallie, if they haue no Countries, Townes, or Prouinces, in that Land which they meane to inuade. And it is very good in ſuch enterpriſes, to haue ſome one naturall borne man in that Countrey to their freende, to be holpen by him, and informed of the humors, intereſt, pretences, conditions and cuſtomes of the enemies: and whether ye places which they inhabite, be plaine, or hillie, and full of Mountaines: and of what thinges the Inhabitants of that Countrey ſtand in neede of, and what things would be moſt acceptable vnto them, to entice them to come to ayde and helpe them: and ſo they ſhall diminiſh their enemies forces, and augment and increaſe their own. It were very good alſo to learne, whether the people of that Countrey which they meane to aſſault, make much of their King, or els hate him, for it chaunceth oftentimes, that the people rebell againſt theyr King, and take part with the enemies, becauſe they hate their King, and would willinglie be reuenged of him, or becauſe they loue the other, and deſire greatlie to haue him to be their King.

Certaine Cities in Aſia did rebell, by reaſon of ye hatred which they bore againſt Laodice and his ſonne Seleucus, and becauſe of the affection with which they loued Bernice and his Sonne. This pollicie Fernandus Cortes vſed in the Conqueſt of the Kingdome of Mexico, making warre againſt King Moteſuma, with his owne Subiects that could not abide him.
               5 Many Princes haue atchiued many famous and excellent victories, through the eſtimation, credit, and reputation of their own perſons. Alexander the great, publiſhed that he wasTitus Liuius decad. 3. lib, 6. Sonne vnto Iupiter, (though he knew it was not ſo) that thoſe Nations vpon whō he made warre, ſhould yeeld and giue ouer their Countries vnto him. If the Captaines and Generals of Armies be valiant and renowned, they procure and obtayne freends and alliance, and eaſilie atchiue victorie: but if they be not famous, they can hardly attaine good ſucceſſe in theyr enterpriſes, &amp; they are alwaies croſſed with vnfortunate euents. Some coūſaile Princes to ſee, whether thoſe Captaines which they chooſe for their warres, be fortunate in thoſe Martial enterpriſes which they vndertake, for it is thought that Fortune (as Saluſt ſaith) preuaileth much in warfare. But ſeeing thatIn Catilina. Fortuna in omni redominatur. the people commonly call that fortune, which by chaunce happeneth well or ill, for which no reaſon can be giuen, and this is vncertaine and variable: no man can perſwade himſelfe that he ſhall alwaies haue proſperous lucke: and for this cauſe was Fortune painted vpon a wheele which is euer turning.

               Seeing that the euents of warres are ſo vncertain and variable, wiſe and valiant Captaines, ought to encreaſe the fame which is bruted abroade of their good lucke and proſperitie, in theyr Martiall endeuours, that they may encourage their ſouldiers to fight, and they that are not fortunate, ought to ſhewe vnto their Souldiers, how inconſtant and variable Fortune is, and to perſwade them that thence-forwarde, all matters wyll2, Reg. 11. ſuccéede more happilie, for the aduenture of war is vncertaine.
               6 The firſt thing that all Princes which make war ought to doo, is to iuſtifie that warre which they take in hand, that all men may knowe, that they are bounde to fight, by the neceſſitie

which compelleth them to defende themſelues: and although their cauſe be good, and grownded vppon reaſon and iuſtice, yet they ought to accept any honeſt and lawfull condition of peace, which their enemies doo offer them. Againe, Princes ought to conſider, that warres are commonly made, either to recouer that which hath béene taken from them, or to reuenge ſome iniurie that hath beene offered vnto them, or becauſe they deſire to atchiue glorie and renowne, or for ambition: the firſt and ſeconde cauſes are iuſt, the thirde is vniuſt, and the fourth is tyrannie.
               The Romans were alwaies verie carefull, in iuſtifying the warres which they made, with all dilligence poſſible. which may be ſeene by this, that the Embaſſadour of the Ile of Rhodes, when he went about to praiſe the people of Rome, ſaide in a certaine Oration which he made to the Senate, that the Romans did not ſo much eſteeme the conqueſt, as the equitie of their cauſe: and becauſe in my booke of Militarie diſcipline, I haue largely writtē how Princes ought to iuſtifie their wars, I meane not heere to ſtand vpon it.
               7 They that conſult vpon Martiall affaires, ought to enquire, when they be ouercome with their enemies, whether the faulte was in the Captaines, or in the common Souldiers, or becauſe it pleaſed God, that though euery man did his duetie, yet they ſhoulde be put to the worſe: and after the cauſe is knowne, they ought to thinke vpon the remedie, and to doe all things that are expedient to atchiue victorie of their enemies. And if they vnderſtande yt their enemies are ſtronger, and that they muſt continue their warres, it is better for them, to defer the field (as Fabius Maximus did) then to enter battell to the manifeſt daunger of their whole Armie. For, with delaying the time, they may ouercome, and with giuing a raſh onſette, they ſhall be put to flight, and as we of olde ſay in Caſtile: Diez aunos de guerra, y no vn dia de pelea, that is;

                     Warres for tenne yeeres aſſay,
                     And battell but one day.
                  
               
               And becauſe no Captaine howe wiſe ſoeuer he be, can imagine and forecaſt all inconueniences which may fall out in war, it is conuenient, that euery Captain take counſaile with faithfull, prudent, and wiſe men, and well experienced in warfare,

which may tell him the trueth without any deceite. The Carthagenians

The Venetians did not permitte their. Generals to pitch a fielde with their enemies, vnleſſe the Prouiſors which were ſent to the wars with them, did conſent vnto it.
               8 Captaines and Generals ſhall obtaine the fauour and good will of the people, if they miniſter iuſtice vnto them, and permit not any one to offer them any iniurie, or to take awaie their ſubſtance vniuſtly, or to diſhonor and diſcredit thē wrongfullie. And as for the good will of the Souldiers, the Captains may obtaine that, by béeing valiant and liberall, for theſe two vertues make a Captaine to be beloued. And though it ſeeme a thing impoſſible, that a Captaine ſhoulde be fauoured, bothe of the people and his Souldiers alſo: becauſe the people wiſhe to keepe their goods and ſubſtaunce, and the Souldiers deſire to pill and robbe, yet notwithſtanding this hindereth not, for they may well enough deale vprightlie with the people, that are their owne freends and alliance; and the Souldiours may rob pill, ſlay, and ſpoyle thoſe that dwell in their enemies Countries. Furthermore, if by chaunce the Captaine be compelled by neceſſitie, to aſke ſome newe tribute, to pay the charges of the warre, he ought with moeke wordes and good reaſons, firſt to ſhew (as Tullie ſaith) the neceſſitie which at that inſtant vrgeth him to demaunde it, and then he ought to let them vnderſtand, that it concerneth the whole Common-wealth: and whē oportunitie ſerued, he woulde repay that which they doe lende him. Generals and Captaines of Armies, ought to ſee that no idle perſons, and ſuch as are vnapt for warre, doo loyter in the Campe, &amp; that each ſouldier imploy himſelfe in all ſuch things, as are thought to be neceſſarie for the atchiuing of victorie.
               9 The Counſellers of Princes, ought to examine, whether it be more profitable for the Common-wealth, to ſtay tillLotinus con

                   affirmed, that it was better for them to deſend thēſelues at home, then to inuade their enemies Countrey. But Scipio ſaid, that

it was more conuenient for the Common-wealth, to warre in Carthage then in Italie. Furthermore, they that conſult ere they determine to maintaine warre, either at home or abroad, ought to conſider, whether it be profitable for the eſtate of the Countrey to make war at all. For though it lie in the power of men to beginne warre, yet cannot they obtain victorie at their pleaſure: and yt commonly many thinges fall out in warfare, which men can neither ſée nor imagine: and yet the warre it ſelfe, the enemies and the ſucceſſe, ſhew &amp; teach what ought to be doone: and for this cauſe it is ſaid, that counſaile is taken in the field. And though the matters that concerne warre, may be communicated and talked of among many, yet they ought to be deliberated vpon but by a fewe: for els they would be diſcouered, before they were determined. Alſo, they that conſult vpon matters touching warre, ought to conſider, whether it be profitable for the Common-wealth, that their Generals &amp; Souldiers ſhould be ſtrangers, or naturall borne Subiects. The Carthagineans did not onely take ſtrange Souldiers into their ſeruice,Strabo magnopere pe

Many Common-weales, after that their Captaines were ouercome, they vanquiſhed their enemies by the ſeruice of ſtrange Captaines: as the Chalcedonians did with Braſidas, the Sicilians with Gylippus, the Aſians with Lyſander, Callicratides, and Agathocles, Captaines of Lacedaemonia. And if it chaunce yt any ſtrange Captains doo tyranniſe ouer the Common-weales which they ayde (as they of the houſe of Othoman did) that happeneth héerof, that they which requeſted them to helpe them, are not able to withſtand their forces, and to defend themſelues againſt thē. The Romans to ſhunne this inconuenience, would not conſent, that they which came to ſuccour or helpe them, ſhould be mightier then themſelues.
               10 Princes ought not to committe the adminiſtration of the warre vnto any perſon whom they haue offended: for ſuch a one, to reuenge the inturie offered vnto him, wold caſt away the Armie. Marius had after ſuch order compaſſed Haſdruball
                  Titus Liu. decad, 3. lib. 6. a noble Captain of Carthage, that he was driuen either to fight with diſaduantage, or die for hunger: but Haſdruball did hold

him ſo cunninglie, with certaine parleyes of agréement, that he gotte out of his reache, and ſo Marius was fruſtrated of the occaſion which was offered him to ouerthrow his enemie: which thing when it was knowne in Rome, did redownd to his great diſcredit, both with the Senate and the people, and euery one through all the Cittie, ſpake verie much euill of him. Within a while after, Marius béeing made Conſull, and going to make warre vpon the enemie, Fabius Maximus ſaide vnto him, thatTitus. Liu. decad, 3, lib. 7. before he came to the day appointed for the field, he ſhoulde ſee what forces the enemies had, and that he ſhould not raſhlie hazard the Armie, and aduenture the libertie of Rome. Vnto whō 
                  Marius anſwered, that as ſoone as he came by the enemie, hee had fullie determined to encounter with him, and béeing aſkedLiuius vbi ſup. why? he ſaid, becauſe he knew, that if he ouercame the enemy, he ſhould recouer the glorie which he had loſt in Spayne, and if that his owne Armie were ouerthrowne, diſperſed and put to flight, he ſhoulde be reuenged of the iniurie which was offered him by that Cittie and thoſe Cittizens which ſo vnthankfullie had offended him.
               Princes ought alſo to conſider the neceſitie which they haue to make warre, and to vnderſtande what prouiſion they ought to make, againſt occaſion be offered them to make warre, that if any ſtrangers goe about to moleſt them, they may defend thē
                  ſelues by force of Armes, and not be vanquiſhed: for there is no Prince ſo great, mightie and ſtrong, but ſome or other may ſet vpon him. And as our olde Caſtilian prouerbe goeth, Muchas vezes chicas piedras aballam grandes carreras.

               And if a Prince be of ſo little vnderſtanding, that he muſt be ruled by that which the Captaines ſay, he is their ſeruaunt, and putteth himſelfe into daunger, either that the Captaines know not what they doo, or that they doo not ſo faithfully &amp; dilligently as they ought.
               11 Thoſe Princes that determine to make warre, ought to imitate the Catholicke King Don Hernando, the firſt of that name, King of Caſtile, who as it were ſtanding on hie in his Towre a farre of, eſpied and watched the ſucceſſe and euent of the wars which the Chriſtian Princes made among thēſelues,

to ſuccour and ayde them that were weakeſt, and not to ſuffer their power to increaſe in Italie, that pretended to make themſelues Lordes ouer it: neither did hee enter league with thoſe Princes that were confederated together, if he could reape no profit thereby: and for this cauſe he would not wage war with Lewes King of Fraunce, when Pope Iulius, the Emperour, and the Zwitcers warred againſt him: for he thought that he ſhould receiue no profit by weakning the Kingdome of Fraunce, with the augmentation of thoſe that did perſecute it. But when hée ſaw, that the King of Fraunce would increaſe his eſtate, and inlarge his kingdome by making warre againſt the kingdome ofMambrinus Roſeus, lib. 1. Hiſtoriae mundi. 
                  Naples, he entered league with the Emperour and the King of England, againſt the King of Fraunce. Finally, ſuch Princes as enter league with other Kings, ought to conſider whether it be better for them, to maintaine that peace which they enioy, or to wage warres: (as King Mithridates wrote to King Arſaces) and whether the warres be iuſt, and ſuch as thereby they may haue profit, and atchiue honour, glory, and renowne.

                  WE haue ſaid that the Counſell of eſtate is called the Counſell of peace, becauſe their principall intent that aſſemble in that Counſell, is to procure that ye people may liue in peace, and if they make warre, if is to defend themſelues from the iniurie of thoſe that trouble &amp; moleſt them. And to ſignifie this, the Romans accuſtomed to were the Millitarie ring on the leftPlin. li. 33. cap. 1. hand, in which they did beare their ſhielde: and not on ye right hand in which they held their ſworde: for they thought it more neceſſarie for a well inſtituted Common-wealth, to defende themſelues then to offend others.

               That it is the duetie of euerie Prince, to defend his ſubiects from the enemie, and gouerne them in peace &amp; quietneſſe, may be ſeene in this, that when he taketh his oath at his Corronation, hee holdeth his Scepter, with which he is to rule his people in time of peace, in his right hand, and his ſworde is borne before him, with which he is to defend his Countrey, if neede be he ſhould make warre for the conſeruation of peace. Séeing therefore that the cheefe Office of a Prince is, to maintain his Subiects in peace, I meane to treate in this diſcourſe of ſuch things as be belonging to the Counſell of peace.
               1 Counſellers of Princes that conſult vpon the eſtabliſhing of peace, ought humbly to requeſt God, that it wil pleaſe him, that the peace may be concluded to his honour and▪

For if the Princes wils be different that make the peace, then is their peace (as the Prophet Ezekiell
                  Capit. 13. ſaith) like vnto the wall that was built vp &amp; daubed with vntempered Morter, which peace may with ſmall violence bée ouerthrowne: for becauſe the loue and conformitie is wanting, it cannot laſt long or continue. The Senate of Rome aſked the men of Pri

if they would graunt it vpon good and honeſt conditions, otherwiſe, it ſhoulde be but very ſhort. They that will eſtabliſhe a firme &amp; ſtable peace, that may continue for euer, ought to procure that God be not angrie or diſpleaſed, but fauourable, propice and mercifull vnto them: that, he béeing the right author of al peace and true concord, may proſper the peace which they make. And they may eaſilie pleaſe and reconcile God, with ſupplication and earneſt prayers, if they humbly with all theyr hart beſeech his holines to giue them iudgment and vnderſtanding to execute iuſtice: for the worke of iuſtice ſhall be peace: euen the worke of iuſtice ſhall be quietnes and aſſurance for euer,Eſay, 32, 17. as Eſay the Prophet ſaith.
               2 If they that conſult vppon the making and eſtabliſhing of peace, cannot conclude, they ought to make a truce for a certaine time, that they may haue ſome ſpace to deliberate vppon it, and to examine the conditions vpon which the peace is to be concluded, and to ſée and cōſider, whether it be better for them to proſecute the warre, or to giue it ouer, and many times a truce béeing made for a time, the peace is eſtabliſhed, whereas there had none béene concluded, if no league had beene made for ſome daies. They ought alſo to perpend &amp; waigh, whether it be better for thē to procure peace, by rēdering ſome Caſtle, towne, or Cittie, or by paying a ſumme of money, or by allowing ſome tribute, or by concluding ſome marriage, or by making of alliance or affinitie, as we haue before ſhewed. They ought alſo to conſider, whether they that demaunde peace, are perſons that vſe to accompliſh that which they promiſe (as Hanniball tolde Scipio, when he demaunded of him, that he woulde ſtabliſhe aLiuius decad, 3. Libro. 30. peace with the Carthagineans) and whether it be better for thē to make the peace, when their enemies be victorious, and may ſette the conditions according to their pleaſure, (as Hannon

               3 Séeing that the augmentation of the Common-wealth, dependeth vpon peace, and the ende for which men take Armes in a Common-wealth well inſtituted, is to conſerue the good eſtate thereof in peace, it is conuenient, that the Counſellers of Princes ſhoulde perſwade their Prince, that it is better to accept an honeſt peace, then to make a daungerous warre. The

                  Lacedemonians and Athenians made ſo great account of peace, and deſired ſo earneſtly, that no occaſion might be offered them to make warre, that they continually ſaide in their banquets, would to God our weapons were hanged ouer with copwebs. In that peace which the Romans concluded with King Porſenna, they allowed it with this condition, that they ſhould not vſe anie yron ſauing in tilling of the grounde. And becauſe oftentimes, the eſtate of the whole Common-wealth, dependeth vppon the conditions vpon which the peace is eſtabliſhed, and men cannot in any other thing erre ſo greatlie to the hurt &amp; domage of the Common-wealth, it is conuenient that they which concludeValerius Maximus. lib. 7. tit. 3. the peace, ſhould be both wiſe and warie. Titus Labeo, béeing vrged to make a peace with King Antiochus, at the ſame Kings demaund, ſaid that hee was contented vppon condition, that halfe of King Antiochus ſhyps ſhould be for the behalfe of the people of Rome, which béeing graunted by the King, Titus Labeo commaunded halfe the part of euery ſhippe to be cutte away: becauſe all the ſhyps ſhould remaine for the Romans. Againe, the Conſuls of Rome agreed to make peace with ye 
                  Carthagineans, ſo they would yeelde and render all the ſhips which they had; ouer vnto them: which as ſoone as the Carthagineans had doone: the Romans commaunded all the ſhyps to be ſette onLucius Florus de geſtis Roma. lib, 2, cap. 5. Et Paulus Horoſius, lib. 4. ca. 22. fire, and tolde the Carthagineans that the Senate of Rome commaunded that they ſhould come foorth of Carthage, and builde a newe Cittie in ſome other place where they woulde, ſo it were tenne Italian myles diſtant from the ſea.
               Many other examples very pregnant for this our purpoſe might I heere alleage. But ſéeing I haue ſette them downe in my Treatiſe De Iuriiurando &amp; promiſsis, I will not heere repeate them.
               4 Though all Common-weales labor to maintain peace, and auoide occaſions of warre: yet the ambition and mallice of men is ſo great, that no man ought to truſt to the peace that is eſtabliſhed betwixt him and his enemies. For vnder the colour of peace, they oftentimes practice many ſubtill deuices, whereby they obtaine that, which vnleſſe ſome peace had béene concluded, they coulde neuer haue attained vnto. Thoſe Princes that are not moleſted with warres, but rule their Subiects in peace, ought not to ſuffer their people ſo to giue themſelues to

eaſe, that they neuer be exerciſed, or trained vppe in Armes, for an vnarmed peace is very weake. Gelon King of Sicilie, beingRobertus Brittaunus in Encomio Agriculturae. perſwaded that thoſe Common-weales in which the people were not exerciſed in Militarie practiſes could not long continue (for peace, vacation from labours, and idlenes, ſpoyle and conſume them) hee commaunded that it ſhoulde be publiſhed through all his Countrey, that great neceſſitie vrged him to make warre, and there withall commaunded, that the people ſhould preſently be muſtered, and taught how to vſe their weapons: and after they had béene trained and ſome thing exerciſed in handling them, he commaunded, that they ſhoulde all of them be placed in order, that they might goe with him to ſeeke the enemie, but when they were all gone, and aſked where the enimies were with whem they ſhould fight: the King ſhewed the fieldes, hils, and valleys vnto thē, ſaying that if they wold atchiue victory ouer their enemies, they ſhould labour in thoſe groundes, felling downe the Trées, and digging out the ſtones that were in them: for ſo dooing, they ſhoulde vanquiſhe thoſe deadly enimies, Sloth and Idlenes, which woulde ouerthrowe and deſtroy the whole Common-wealth, if they were not in time expelled: and no Nation durſt make war vpon them ſeeing that they were practiſed in exerciſes of warre, and accuſtomed to labour. For (as Titus Liuius ſaith) the enemies themſeluesDecad, 3. lib. 30. doo not the Common-wealth ſo much harme, as delight and wantonnes.

                  COunſellers of Princes, eſpecially they of the Counſell of the eſtate, ought to vnderſtande and know, wherwith Common-weales be augmented, and by what means they decaie again. The famous S.

Scriptures ſaie) the meaſure of the Amorites is filled: GOD ſendeth them Princes that ſtand thē in ſteede of Tormentors: but if they amēded their liues, and enclined their harts to repentaunce, as Niniuie did, he wold pardon them. For it is theIonae. cap. 3. propertie of his diuine Maieſtie, to pardon and ſhewe mercie vnto thoſe, that from the bottome of their hart doo cal vnto him, and repent themſelues of their ſinnes. And vnto thoſe people which are iuſt and vertuous, God giueth good Kings, and ſuch as doo the Common-wealth much good, and are as Angels ſent from heauen, to conſerue and defend her. Therfore thoſe Princes that doo not this, accompliſh not their dutie, and cannot be properlie called Princes, but equiuocally as a painted man is called a man. The holie Scriptures call thoſe Princes that dooIob. 34. not miniſter iuſtice, vnto euery man according to the commandement of God, hypocrites: for they haue no princely thing in them, but onely the name of Princes, and béeing moſt cruell Wolues, they be maſked and diſguiſed with tokens onelie, and ſhewes of moſt mercifull Princes.
               2 God doth oftentimes permit, that Princes ſhould ſuffer many troubles and aduerſities, to turne them from their wicked liues, and to ſhewe them that God dooth puniſh &amp; chaſtice Princes, Kings, Monarches, and Emperours, when they gouerne not their people as they ought, according to the will and pleaſure of the higheſt Monarch of the world. After this manner,Cap. 4. ſaith the Prophet Daniel, that God did ſhew vnto Nabuchadnezzar King of Babilon; how that God is Lord of all kingdomes, &amp; giueth them vnto whom he will: and euen as Schoolmaiſters correct their Schollers, to make them to applie theyr bookes, and duelie come to ſchoole: ſo GOD dooth chaſtice the Princes of the earth, that they may performe their duetie, and vnderſtand that the true beginning to gouerne well, as well in time of peace as war, conſiſteth in knowing that God Almightic is the Lord of all kingdomes, and that the beginning of allProuer. 1. knowledge and wiſedome (as King Salomon ſaith) is the feare of the Lord: and this is ye firſt leſſon which they ought to learn that will follow him, and the firſt ſhewe and token which they make in the ſchoole of his doctrine. The feare of the Lorde is glorie and gladnes, and reioycing, and a ioyfall crowne. And the feare of the Lord maketh a merrie hart, and giueth gladnes

and ioy, and long life, and who ſo feareth the Lord, it ſhall goe well with him at the laſt, and hee ſhall finde fauour in the day of his death. The Prophet Dauid beeing taught by the holiePſalm. 2. Ghoſt, ſaith. Be wiſe now therefore ye Kinges: be learned ye Judges of the earth, ſerue the Lord in feare, &amp; reioyce in trembling. Kiſſe the Sonne leaſt he be angry, and ye perriſh in the way, when his wrath ſhall ſuddainlie burne, bleſſed are al they that put their truſt in him. And thoſe that follow not this doctrine, God viſiteth with calamities and aduerſities, which hee ſendeth vnto them to cauſe them to turne frō their wickednes, and to obey his commandements. That which we ſay of Chriſtian Princes, is alſo to be vnderſtoode of thoſe iuſt and vertuous Princes, whom God doth croſſe with miſ-fortunes &amp; troubles, that they may be ſuffering them patientlie, deſerue that glorie which God giueth vnto thē that ſerue him. To be preſſed with miſerie, plague, famine, fire and warre, is common both to good and wicked men: but onely good &amp; vertuous men die in the ſeruice of our Lorde and Sauiour Jeſus Chriſt, bearing his croſſe on their ſhoulders: for (as the kingly ProphetPſalm, 115. ſaith) precious in ye ſight of the Lord is the death of his Saints.
               3 God alſo deſtroieth Cōmon-weales by appointing children to rule ouer them as the Prophet Eſay ſaith, and I will appoint children to be their Princes, and babes ſhal rule ouerthem.Cap. 3. For ſorrowfull (as King Salomon ſaith) is that Kingdome,Eccleſi. 10. in which the Prince that ruleth it is a Childe, and they that giue him counſaile and gouerne him, are giuen to theyr luſtes and pleaſures▪ and alſo the Prophet Hoſeas ſaith, that when God is angrie, and will puniſh the people for their ſinnesCap, 2. which they commit, he appointeth children to be their Princes. The Romans in theyr proceſſions, beſéeched God continuallie, that it would pleaſe him to be ſo fauourable vnto them, as notAuertant ſuperi a nobis reges pueros quorum manus tutor regat. Eccleſi. cap. 4. Eſay. 5. Eſay. 5. 2. Reg 3. to appoint Children that ſhoulde be gouerned by Tutors and Protectors, to rule ouer them. But yet (as King Salomon ſaith) better is a poore and wiſe Childe, then an olde and fooliſh King which will be no more admoniſhed: for olde fooles are in the Scriptures called children of an hundred yeeres of age. GOD doth alſo chaſtice the Common-weales, giuing them baſe and vile perſons, that ſhall put their hands to the wherue, (as the Scriptures ſay) &amp; handle the ſpyndle. Which thing is properly

                  Rome, becauſe of the Lawes Agraria, which cauſed great alterations at euerie time that the people of Rome did intend to eſtabliſh it in that Cittie: this Lawe Agraria had two eſpeciall clauſes; the one ordained, that no Cittizen might poſſeſſe more then a certaine number of Akers of lande: the other, that all what ſoeuer was gotten from the enemies, ſhould be equallie deuided among the people of Rome: and this Lawe was verie hurtfull to the Noble men, for it depriued them of their goods, and hindered them from increaſing their welth and riches. But the Noble men oppoſing themſelues, ſought one remedie or other to put down this Law: and either they brought an Armie of man out of the Cittie, or they cauſed that when one Tribune did propoſe the Lawe, another ſhoulde contrarie him: or they graunted part of the Lawe: or they ſent people to inhabit that place which ſhould haue beene diſtributed among the people of Rome: to be ſhort, howe hurtfull it is to fauour and maintaine ſciſmes and partialities in a Common-wealth, may be ſeene, in that many Common weales haue béene therby deſtroied and ouerthrowne: and therefore Plato calleth diſſentions and factions,In dialogo, 1, &amp; 5. de legibus. poyſon, that ſpoyleth and deſtroyeth Common-weales. To make an end, thoſe Common-weales that are gouerned by the people, perriſh and decay, if one man continue long in the gouernment, and this was the cauſe of the deſtruction of Rome, as may be noted in Iulius Caeſar who tyranniſed, though notwithſtanding Cato Vticenſis (wiſelie diuining and coniecturing the euent of the matter) contraried the people of Rome, in that they did appoint Iulius Caeſar to continue in the generallſhip, longger then his day before prefixed: ſaying, that they gaue the Armes and weapons vnto him, that with them ſhould deſtroy them, Unto which, Pompey (who at that time fauoured Iulius Caeſar) anſwered, that Cato by ſaying ſo, did nothingels, but

giue thē occaſion to ſuſpect, that he owed Iulius Caeſar a grudg: and that which he ſaid himſelfe, did procéed of freendſhippe. Againe, the people of Rome hauing appointed the Trybunes or Protectors of the Commons, to continue in their Office the ſecond yeere, becauſe they thought that they were very ſufficient to withſtand the ambition of the Noble men: and to maintain the libertie and benefite of the Common people, againſt theyr power: the Senate, becauſe they would not ſerme to haue leſſe power and authoritie then the people, would haue had Lucius Quintius (who at that time was to giue ouer his Conſulſhip to ſome other) to continue in his Office, and be Conſull an other yeeere: but Lucius Quintius contraried the Senate in that, ſaying, that naughtie examples ought to be ſhunned, &amp; not multiplied and increaſed with another farre worſe example: andLybanus in argumento ad Olynthiacam primam Demoſthenis. would haue them to chooſe newe Conſuls. Laſtly, Commonweales perriſh and decay, if they that beare rule ouer them, be young men, little experienced in gouernment: and the people that liue in them is verie riche, for it is naturall vnto them to be careleſſe, negligent, and vicious if they be welthie: and vnleſſe neceſſitie vrge them to labor, they will neuer take paines. Finallie, Counſellers of Princes ought to conſider, that commonlyChronica Petri. Luſsitani regis Lib, 18. cap. 23. ſixe things cauſe Common-weales to decay. The firſt and cheefe cauſe of the deſtruction of a Common-welth, is contempt, when men are little accounted or eſteemed of. The ſecond is couetouſnes, or inordinate deſire of other mens goods. The third is, inordinate delectation in worldlie thinges, when men will fulfill their pleaſure, and doo all thinges according to their owne will. The fourth is diſobedience, when men tranſgreſſe the Lawes wilfullie. The fift is crueltie, when theyPlato Epiſt. 1. Saluſt in Iugurtham. that beare rule, exerciſe tyrannie. And the ſixt and laſt, is want of freends, when men haue not freends to giue them counſaile.
            
            
               The ſeuenteenth diſcourſe. How and wherewith Common-weales be increaſed.
               COmmon weales are made bigger and greater, thrée manerMachiauellus, Lib, 1. cap. 4. diſcurſ. of waies. The firſt is, by manner of league, or alliance, to be in league with diuers other Cōmon-weales, which all of them be one as rich, as mightie, and as great

as an other, and in all points equall, ſo that none of them haue any aduantage of the other: and when any of them conquer any place, they make the reſt partakers of the conqueſt, as the Suicers do in Heluecia, and as the Aguei and Ethoti did in Greece. The ſeconde manner to augment Common-weales, is, alſo by way of alliance: but in ſuch ſorte, that they haue the chéefe authoritie, rule, and gouernment, and the tytle of all the enterpriſes: this maner is the beſt, and was vſed of the Romans: for they kéeping the emperial ſeate, and tytle of commaund to them ſelues, theyr alliants depriued of all power and authoritie, of themſelues by their owne ſweat and blood, became ſubiect vnto them, ſeeing they were compaſſed about, and oppreſſed on the ſuddaine by ſuch a mightie Cittie as Rome was: and of alliants and companions, became ſubiects and bond-men, not béeing able to defende themſelues, by reaſon that they had increaſed, augmented, and aduaunced the Romaine Empire with their owne forces. The third and laſt manner, for Common-weales to be augmented and enlarged, is, to make them whom they ouercome, not fellowes, but ſubiects, as the Spartans did: but of all thrée, this is leaſt profitable, if they be not able to keepe and gouerne thoſe Citties which they conquer. For it is commonlie ſayd, that he that conquereth an Empire and forces withal, becommeth mightie: but hee that atchiueth an Empire without forces, muſt néedes decay. The Romans to augment theyr Common-wealth, did imitate them that prune Trees, who to make a Tree grow and bring forth fruite in time, doo cut off the firſt boughes, that the vertue of that plant may remaine in the ſtemme, and by reaſon thereof, greener and more fruitfull boughes may ſpring out of it. And that this manner to enlarge an Empire or dominion is good and neceſſaire, may be prooued by the example of Sparta and Athens, which beeing two Common-weales very ſtrong, mightie, well Armed, and eſtabliſhed with moſt excellent and perfect Lawes, could neuer reache or attaine to that greatnes, vnto which the Empire of Rome was aduaunced. And yet did Rome ſéeme to be more ful of diſordered and ſeditſous troubles and contentions: yea and nothing ſetled in ſuch good order and faſhion, as thoſe two other Commonweales, Sparta and Athens: whereof no other reaſon can be alleaged, then that which is alreadie giuen: for Rome, (becauſe it

had augmented the body of the Citty by thoſe two waies which we haue ſhewed) could gather together eyght &amp; twentie thouſand men for their defence, and Sparta and Athens, neuer coulde goe beyond the number of twentie thouſand each of them. And this came not becauſe Rome was ſcituated in a better place then Sparta or Athens, but by reaſon that a different kinde of procéeding was vſed, in the erecting and eſtabliſhing of thoſe Common-weales: for Lycurgus the firſt founder of the Spartane Common-wealth, thinking that nothing coulde ſo eaſilie innouate or abrogate his Lawes, as the mixture and confuſion of newe Inhabitants, he bethought himſelfe all meanes poſſible, howe he might bring to paſſe, that no Straungers ſhoulde come to dwell in Sparta, or be conuerſant in it: and therefore he ordained, that in his Common-weale, no money ſhould be vſed but of Copper, becauſe no man ſhould haue any mind to come and dwel in that Cittie, or to bring any Merchandize or wares thether from fortaine Countries. And for this cauſe the companie of the Cittizens could neuer be increaſed. And becauſe al our actions imitate nature, and it is impoſſible that a little thin ſtocke ſhould ſupport or holde vp a great thicke branche, therefore a ſmall and weake Common-welth, cannot ouercome and vanquiſh great and mightie Citties and kingdomes, that are more puiſſaunt and ſtronger then it is: and if it doe conquer any, then it fareth with it, as it doth with thin and ſmal ſiemms, that haue groſſe boughes &amp; braunches, ſo that the ſmalleſt wind that is, doth blowe them downe and ouerturne them, as it hapned with Sparta, which hauing taken all the Citties of Grecce by force, Thebes no ſooner rebelled, but all the other Citties did riſe with them againſt her: and ſo the ſtocke remained without braunches, which thing could not befall on Rome, becauſe the ſtocke was ſo groſſe, that it was able to beare vppe and to ſupport the waight of any braunche.
               5 Common-weales be alſo augmented, by fauouring the Inhabitans: for when they that dwell in them, may liue fréelie out of bondage, and be Maiſters and Lordes of their owne ſubſtaunce, and ſuch goods as they get by their labor and trauaile, they multiply and increaſe their riches, as well in huſbandrie and tillage, as in Artes, handicrafts, trades, and Merchandize, for euery one doth with a good will, increaſe and heape vppe

thoſe goods which hee hopeth that hee may enioy after he hath got them. And by this it commeth to paſſe, that men ſo earneſtlie ſtriue and contend one with an other who may beſt regarde, both his owne commoditie &amp; the publique profit alſo. But contrarilie, in thoſe Countries and Prouinces, that are oppreſſed with ouer many tributes, and ouercharged with exceſſiue tols: the people thinke vpon nothing but how they may liue idle, andFranciſcus Alu

                     res in hiſtoria 1. Ethiopiae. fol. 205. make good cheere vppon the Kinges coſt. The Ethiopians haue much fruitfull lande, which might bring foorth a wonderfull deale of excellent fruite: but by reaſon of the exceſſiue tols, and vnreaſonable tribute which they pay, they will not take pains to labour and huſband more ground, then may ſuffice for theyr ſuſtenaunce. And becauſe the King of China, in the Prouince ofGaſpar de Crus. 
                  Chapan, taketh away the ſubſtaunce of the Crafts men if they be rich: and if they will not giue it, he doth commaunde them to be impriſoned; none of thoſe Prouinces will labour, nor take paines to get more then they need for their maintainance. And on the otherſide, becauſe they that liue in China, pay but ſmall tribute, they be very induſtrious, and take wonderfull paines to heape vppe riches, and looſe nothing wherby they may reape any profit: in ſo much, that of the bones of dogges and other beaſtes, they make little trifles for Children to play with, and pay money for the ordure of the neceſſaries, to dung and fatten their grounds.
               Furthermore, Common-weales be augmented and increaſed, by miniſtring iuſtice equallie vnto all men, not ſuffering any notorious offences to eſcape vnpuniſhed: and by hauing an eſpecial regard of Religion. For iuſtice &amp; Religion, are the two principal pillers yt ſupport al weales publicke, without which, no Cōmon-wealth can dure long, or continue: and with which, little Common-weales be enlarged &amp; made bigger, and great ones continue in their bignes, as I writte more at large in my bookes De Politijs et rebus publicis. Laſtly, Common-weales be increaſed and amplified, by not ſuffering any one of thē that prouide them of maintenaunce and Merchandize, to engroſſe thinges, that no man may ſell or gaine but they: for theſe men cauſe the Common-wealth neuer to be without famine and dearth. Dioniſius King of Sicilie, baniſhed a certaine Merchant,Ariſto. Pol. lib, 2. cap. 7. becauſe hee had bought vppe all the yron that was brought to

                  Sicilie, that he might ſel it onelie, and haue al the gaines to him ſelfe. Finallie, Common-weales he augmented and amplified, by the carefulnes of Princes, if they prouide all things neceſſarie for their Subiects: euen as Sheepheards procure paſturingXenophon lib. 8 Cyropaediae. and folds for their ſhéepe, ſhearing them (as the Emperor Tiberius ſaid) and not fleaing them. For (as Socrates ſaide) he is not a good Sheepheard that diminiſheth his ſheepe, and doothEraſ. in Apoth. Xenophon. lib. 1 de dictis &amp; factis Socratis.

For ſéeing that theſe inferiour thinges, are in perpetuall alteration, they cannot be euerlaſting, but are changed out of one gouernment into another, after men haue had experience of thoſe inconueniences, which were in the gouernment which they had at firſt, To wit, if the Common-wealth were gouerned by the people, (which eſtate of gouernment is called Democracia) after they haue made tryall of thoſe inconueniences which are in the Democratie, or popular eſtate, they bring in Ariſtocratia, (which is, when the Common-wealth is gouerned by the Noble men or cheefe perſons) and after that they haue tried the Ariſtocracie, they chooſe ſome principall perſon, that may defend, gouerne and protect them: who oftentimes exerciſeth tyrannie vppon them. And becauſe the ende of euery CommonwealthPlato. Vbi ſup. Ariſt. Polit. 5. cap. 5. Nā maxima ſete ex parte veteres tyranni extribunis plebis ex

But becauſe they who haue all the authoritie of the Commen-wealth, exerciſe tyrannie vpon the people, the Noble men and cheefe of the Realme riſe againſt them, and either kill them, or caſt them downe from theyr ſoueraigntie, tranſlating ye whole gouernment of the Common-wealth vnto themſelues, and vſurping all the authoritie which the Monarch had, who ruled alone without péere. And if chaunce theſe cheefe Noble men gouerne tyrannouſlie, then the people, they ariſe againſt them, and diſpoſſeſſe them of the gouernment, and will rather be ruled by one King, then by many Peeres. And this is the alteration which Common-weales commonlie ſuſtaine, returning to the beginning from whence they firſt beganne. For Democracie, chaungeth into Oligarchie, (which is, when a few perſons haue all the authoritie) &amp; Oligarchie changeth into Monarchie

Plato ſaith, that the Common-wealthes are verie4. Delegibus. hardly brought out of tyrannie vnto a Kingdome, and out of a Kingdom into the Democracie: and out of the Democracie into the Oligarchie, but to change the gouernment out of the Oligarchie into ſome other eſtate, is moſt harde and difficult, for they which hinder and let it, are many and preuaile much.
               2 The moſt difficult reformation of all, is to reſtore a Cō
                  mon-wealth which is in ſubiection, into a frée eſtate: for the eſtateMachiauellus li. 1. cap. 16. de diſcurſ. of the Common-wealth is ſoone altered, but very hardlie reformed, and reſtored to the former gouernment: becauſe people vpon ſmall cauſe ariſe, but are not ſo ſoone appeaſed, eſpeciallie if they once be giuen to liue diſſoloutlie, as it was ſéene inAntonius de Gauara in Epiſtolis. 
                  Rome, when Brutus and Caſsius went about to reſtore the Cittie vnto fréedome: and though they were fauoured by manie, both of the nobleſt and cheefeſt of the Cittie, yet they could not bring it to paſſe, for the Cittie was quite alreadie marred and ſpilt, by reaſon of the diſſentions and warres of Sylla and Marius, and of Caeſar and Pompey, and the Romans were now as it were accuſtomed to liue in bondage. Beſides this, they that labour or endeuour to ſet any Common-wealth at libertie, find partiall enemies, but no partiall freendes; for all they become to be their partiall enemies, that were the better by ye Prince his eſtate, and reaped great profite by him and his ſubſtaunce. For they will be loth to haue the Prince depriued of his kingdome, leaſt they ſhould fare the worſe by it: or if by happe the Prince be depoſed of his gouernment, they ſéeing the Kings authoritie to be decaied, by reaſon whereof they are depriued of the commodity which they were wont to haue, cannot liue contentedlie, but continuallie ſeeke meanes to attaine to the authoritie and fauoure which they enioyed before. And on the otherſide, they that endeuour to ſette any Common-wealth at libertie, finde no partiall freendes: becauſe to liue at libertie, ſeemeth to be nothing els, then to aſpire to honor &amp; rewardes,

by meanes of ſome honeſt and lawfull cauſes, for otherwiſe no man is either honoured and rewarded. And when any perſon receiueth thoſe preheminences, profits, and cōmodities, which he thinketh that he deſerueth, then he confeſſeth not that hée is bound to him that honoureth and rewardeth him. Moreouer, the common profit which is gotten by liuing in a frée Common wealth, is not knowne by any one, as long as he dooth not enjoy it: which is, to enioy the vſe and commoditie of hys owne ſubſtance, and to diſpoſe of it at his pleaſure. And they that will goe about to remedie &amp; redreſſe theſe inconueniences, and dyſorders, ought to doo as Brutus did, killing all thoſe that oppoſe themſelues againſt that newe gouernment which they wyll bring in to the Common-wealth. Which, Brutus well might doo, for when he expelled the Kinges, the people of Rome were not ſo vicious, nor ſo full of diſſolute manners, nor ſo wickedlie giuen, as when Brutus &amp; Caſsius ſlew Iulius Caeſar. And whenLib. 1. Quotus quiſquis reliquus erat, qui rempub. vidiſſet. 
                  Auguſtus Caeſar vſurped the Monarchie of the Romaine Empire, there was not one in Rome, (as Cornelius Tacitus ſaith) that knewe what it was to liue in a free Common-wealth.
               3 Thoſe Princes vnto whom the Common-weales are committed, as vnto Protectors which ſhould defend them, and yet exerciſe crueltie vpon them, deſtroying, killing, and ſeyſing vpon theyr goods, that hinder them from béeing abſolut Lords, haue much adoe, and incurre great daunger to maintaine the tyrannie or kingdome which they vſurpe. For they muſt deſtroy all thoſe which may reſiſt them: which they may eaſilie doo, Arming thēſelues with the lawes to iuſtify their intention, as all thoſe haue doone, which haue tyrannized ouer thoſe Common-wealesAri. li. 4.

               The popular Regiment is reformed vnto the gouernment of a fewe, and that gouernment in which a few haue all the authoritie, is chaunged into the Monarchie: and the Monarchie into the tyrannie: or out of one extreame into the other, without paſſing by the meane gouernments. Euen as betwixt the North and the South there be many windes, which take part with the chéefe and vttermoſt winds, and as betwirt black and white there be many diuerſities of colours: ſo betwixt the Democracie and the Tyrannie, (which is a cruell or violent rule or gouernment for a priuate commoditie, and not a publique

weale) there be many diuerſities of gouernmēts, which are mixed with both ye two extreames: &amp; to paſſe out of ye one extreame into the other, they neede not paſſe through thoſe gouernmēts which haue the place in a meane betwéene them. Albeit in naturall things, no tranſinutation can be made out of the one extreame into the other; without paſſing through ye means which are betwixt both the extreames. Yet this doth not hold in thoſe things which depend vpon mans will, which eaſily paſſe out ofAuerrois, in paraph. ad li. Platonis de Repub. Et Melchior canꝰ in tractatu de Sacramentis. one extreame into the other, without paſſing through ye means which are betwixt both the extreames.
               4 It were needles to diſpute of all the alterations of gouernments in the Common-wealth, and howe eaſily they be chaunged out of one forme into another. They that are deſirous to vnderſtande this matter more exactly, let them reade Bartholomew

                  Caualeante, who handleto it verie largelie, examining and ſifting the opinions of Plato, Ariſtotle, and Polibius, concerning the tranſ-formations of Common-weales, which ſomtimes alter &amp; quite change that kind of gouernment which they had before, ſometimes enlarge it, and ſometimes diminiſh it. Theſe alterations are made as Ariſtotle ſaith, either out ofPol. lib. 5. ill gouernments into good, or out of good gouernments into better, or out of ill gouernments into worſe. This is verified in the Democracie, Oligarchie, Ariſtocracie, &amp; Monarchie, which (béeing in themſelues good gouernments if they be ruled according to reaſon and iuſtice) may be chaunged thus. The Democracie into the Oligarchie, and the Oligarchie into the Ariſtocracie, and ye 
                  Ariſtocracie into the Monarchie: and ſo, one good gouernment, into another gouernment, as good or better. Alſo a good gouernment is chaunged into an ill, and that ill gouernment, either into one of the ſame kind, or into one of an other kind. As for example, into the ſame kind, as the kingdome into the tyrannie: the Democracie and Ariſtocracie, into a good or bad adminiſtration: and out of one kind into another, as the Ariſtocracie and Democracie, into any one of the other cōtrary kinds of gouernments. Notwithſtanding that which ſome ſay,Bartholom. Caualcante vbi ſup. that the badde and good gouernments are contraries, which is prooued, becauſe thoſe things are contrarie, which béeing of the ſelfe ſame kind, doo much differ the one from the other, and yet are apt and diſpoſed to be produced out of the ſelfe ſame ſubiect

according to the doctrine of Plato and Ariſtotle: but that thePlat. In Phaedone. Ari. In poſt predicamētis. &amp; 1. phyſicorom. contrarie gouernments are vnder the ſelfe ſame kinde, conſidering them according as they be good and badde, and are in dyſpoſition to be produced in the ſame ſubiect, may manifeſtlie be ſeene in the Monarchie or tyrannie, and in all other gouernments, whoſe ſubiect is the people in which they be produced, and therfore if ſuch gouernments be cōtraries, it ſeemeth that no tranſ-formation or alteration can be made, out of a good gouernment into an ill gouernment, without paſſing through the meane gouernments that are indifferently betwixt bothe the extreames.
               5 Vnto this obiection ſome anſwer, that contraries are not very diſtant one from the other, and doo not much differ, for they be very neere ioyned, both in the kind vnder which they be, and in ye ſubiect in which they be produced. And thoſe things which any way whatſoeuer are differing (which are called oppoſita, diuerſa, &amp; differentia) are far more diſtant one from the other, then thoſe thinges which are contrarie: and ſeeing contraries are ioyned very neere together, the one contrarie may eaſily be changed into the other: hence it followeth that ye Monarchie is more eaſily altered into the tirannie, then into the Democracie or Oligarchie, though Ariſtotle notwithſtanding ſay, thatLib. 3.

Ariſto. lib. 2. de generat. &amp; corrup. facilis eſt tranſitus in ſymbolizantibus. the gouernment paſſeth more eaſilie out of the Ariſtocracie into the Democracie, then foorth of the Monarchie into the Tyrannie: his reaſon is, becauſe the Tyrannie is contrarie to the Monarchie, but the Ariſtocracie is ioyned neere vnto the Democracie. And thoſe thinges which are like one to another, and doo (as the Philoſophers ſay) ſymbolizare, be eaſilie tranſ-formed and chaunged out of one into another. But thys hindereth not: for it holdes in neceſſarie and naturall, but not in morrall agents, which depend vpon the free will, as I haue written more at large in my bookes De amore Diuino, humano et caſto. Thence it foloweth that the people tranſ-form and chaunge the gouernments one into the other, as they think wil be better and more profitable for them, without following theVbi ſupra. order of the naturall tranſ-formations and alterations. Bartholomewe Caualcante giueth other ſolutions for this obiection, which are rather to be diſputed of in Schooles, thē to be handled of thoſe which intreate of the gouernment of Common-weales.

                  Polibius affirmeth, that the Monarchies be commonly reformedLibro. 6. with the Ariſtocracies, and the Ariſtocracies with the Oligarchies, and the Oligarchies with the Democracies. Ariſtotle
                  5. Politicorum. examineth and ſifteth this matter better thē 
                  Polibius, who could not reade Ariſtotles bookes, for his heyres hid them, and they were founde and brought to Rome in the time of Sylla the Dictator, who was long after Polibius: for Polibiꝰ was in theStrabo. lib. 13. time of Scipio the Affricane. This which Ariſtotle and Polibius diſpute of, concerning the reformation of Cōmon-weales, which are more eaſily reformed into the contraries, then into thoſe which are next vnto them: is to be vnderſtoode accordingIn lib. 5. Polit. cap. vlt. to that which S. Thomas ſaith: to wit, that Plato will not haue, that the gouernment of Common-weales ſhall be onelie changed vnto that which is next vnto each of them, but yt they be tranſ-formed and chaunged, after that manner as we haue ſaid, that thoſe things were to be tranſ-formed, which doo ſymbolize one with another. And ſéeing that Plato vnderſtādeth it after this manner, there is no reaſon why Ariſtotle ſhould reprehend him: for Ariſtotle himſelfe ſaith, that thoſe things are eaſily tranſ-formed that doo (as ye Naturall Philoſophers terme it) ſymbolize one with the other.
               6 Plato affirmeth, that Common-weales are altered out ofDialogo. 8. de Repub. one kind of gouernment into another, becauſe they that gouern them, regard their owne particular profit, more then the publique commoditie of the Common-wealth. For becauſe of their own priuate commoditie, they marrie Noble men with ſome of the Comminaltie, and will haue that ſome children in the Cō
                  mon-wealth, ſhould not follow the eſtimation and nobilitie of their fathers. Plato prooueth this, ſaying, that Nature whē ſhe bringeth forth men, ſhe communicateth the properties of Mettals vnto them: and giueth the propertie of Golde vnto thoſe which are apt to gouerne Nations: and to thoſe that are valiant and hardie, ſhe communicateth the propertie of ſiluer, that they may defend the Common-wealth: becauſe ſhee giueth the nobleſt place in the Common-wealth vnto them that gouerne it. And for this cauſe, euen as Gold is the moſt excellent of all Mettals, ſo the Arte of gouerning a Common-wealth, is the moſt excellent and worthieſt Arte of all. And as ſiluer is eſtéemedAriſto. lib. 1. cap. 2. Ethico. moſt worthie of all Mettals next vnto gold: ſo they which

defend the Common-weale are cheefe, and peſſeſſe the ſeconde place next to them that gouerne it. But I doo not beléeue that they which followe warre, will conſent vnto that which Plato ſaith. But ſéeing that Armes little profit or auaile without the counſaile of thoſe which gouerne the Cōmon-wealth, &amp; though Armes be neceſſarilie required for the defence of the ſame: yet notwithſtanding, the ſcience or arte of gouerning &amp; ruling Nations &amp; Countries, is very neceſſarie in a well inſtituted Common-weale, as I writt more at large in my Bookes of Militarie diſcipline. But to return to Plato, he attributeth the propertie of Yron and Copper, vnto ye Mechanicall Artificers and handicrafts men: and hee ſaith furthermore, that they which mingle theyr progenies and linages, marrying thoſe that are of noble blood, with thoſe that are of the Comminaltie, are like vnto thoſe which mingle Gold with Siluer, Yron, or Copper: and that hence it procéedeth, that the Nobilitie of th
                     •
                  ſe which gouerne the Common-wealth diminiſh: and that the Nobilitie diminiſhing, one gouernment is changed into another. And becauſe they which gouerne the Common-wealth, ſhoulde not mingle the propertie of Golde, with the propertie of Syluer or Yron, Plato would haue, that euery one ſhold marrie with one of his owne eſtate and qualitie: they that are of Noble blood, with Noble women, and the Common-people with the Comminaltie, labouring men with labourers, &amp;c.
               The Romans did not ſuffer any of the nobilitie to marie with any of the Comminaltie. And certaine of the people of the Eaſt Indies, obſerue this order, that euery one marieth an other that is of the ſame trade.

For thoſe Common-weales in which many poore people liue, are full of theeues and wicked perſons, maiſters and authors of all myſchiefe and ribaldrie. That we might ſhun this inconuenience ſo hurtfull and preiudiciall to the Common-wealth, Plato coū
                  ſaileth vs, that as the Bées ſuffer not the Drones which helpe not to make honey, to eate of it: ſo ought they which gouerne the Common-wealth, not to permitte idle and vagabund poore folke to corrupt and ſpoile the Common-wealth, maintayning their idle beggerie with the painfull Cittizens thrift. For ſuch

people loue new reformations, becauſe they haue hope through them, to find ſome remedie for their pouertie &amp; miſerie. TheyLiuius decad. 3. lib. 3.

Indéed Plato, to the end that the gouernment of the Common-weales might not be altered by reaſon of pouertie, woulde haue (that according to the lawes of Nature) all goods immoouable ſhould be common: and that thoſe which gouerne the Cōmon-weales ſhould deuide and parte thoſe goods, conformable to euerie one his neceſſitie. This Common-wealth which Plato inſtituteth, is as it were an Idaea of all other Common-weales, as I writt more at large, in my booke of ciuill and politique gouernments of Common▪weales, in the Treatiſe of lawfull and honeſt aſſemblies.
               8 Ariſtotle affirmeth, that rich men doo alter and deſtroyLi. 4. Poli. ca. 13 Nā ſeditioſi non ſolēt eſſe pauperes, ijque omnes qui ad honores nō conſcendunt, niſi quis cos violet aut aliquam partem facultatū detrahat. Common-weales more then poore men, becauſe they that are wealthie and ambitious, can preuaile much, and they will not, nor know not how to obey the Lawes, whereas poore men are conſtrained-to doo otherwiſe. And heerein Ariſtotle is not againſt that which Plato ſaith: for Plato ſpeaketh not of thoſe poore men that can maintain themſelues, with that which they gette by their owne labour, and haue wherewithall to ſuccour and help themſelues: for theſe men are not able to change the eſtate of the Common-weale in which they liue, and béeing accuſtomed to maintain themſelues with a little, and alwaies be occupied and imploied in their buſines, they haue no time nor leyſure to take ſo great a matter in hande. But if the people be oppreſſed, and ouercharged with too many tributs, or cannot maintaine themſelues with that which they gette: then they finde that which they cannot of themſelues doo, for want of forces to execute it, in thoſe which are able to diſquiet the Cōmonwealth, and chaunge the gouernment, and ſo with the helpe of the welthy and ambitious people, ſéeing that they haue more forces then their enemies, they hope that they ſhall eaſily ouercome them, and be deliuered from thoſe troubles wherewith they be oppreſſed. So that the rich and ambitious men diſquiet the Common-wealth, becauſe they are able, and the poore men

are compelled to alter the gouernment, through the ignorance and ſmal policie of thoſe that gouerne them. Who becauſe they kéepe them not ſtill imploied, or becauſe they prouide not ſuch things for them as be néedfull to their ſuſtenaunce, or charge them with ouer many toles, giue them occaſion to aſſemble together, and ſeeke meanes by which they may chaunge the gogernment and diſquiet the Common-wealth. This néedeth not to be declared by examples, ſeeing it is knowne vnto all men. Moreouer, the gouernment is ſoone changed in that Commonwealth, in whith many idle and careles fellowes liue, though they be not poore. For ſuch fellowes diſquiet the Cōmon welth, and ſuffer none to liue quietlie that dwell in it. And ſéeing they be neuer occupied in lawful practiſes, and honeſt exerciſes, they are alwaies readie to fauour and aſſiſt all factions and part-takings, that ariſe in the Common-wealth: they goe vppe and downe the ſtreetes in all corners of the Towne, perſwading and alluring mens children and ſeruants, not to obey their fathers and maiſters, and diſquieting married folkes, and thoſe that liue with that which they gaine with the ſweat of theyr browes: laſtlie, they are inſtruments of all vices, wickednes, and miſchiefes that are committed in the Common-welth. And for this cauſe is this Spaniſh prouerbe vſed.

But Pythagoras imitating the Aſtrologians, would perſwade thoſe yt folowed him, that he tolde of thinges to come by nūbers.

Common-wealth change and alter, if that the muſick which is vſed in them be changed: and that, to ſhun ſo dangerous a loſſe and detriment, they that gouerne Common-wealths, ought not to ſuffer any new kind of Muſicke to be brought into them: for the manners and cuſtomes of the people change when Muſick altereth. Ariſtotle counſelleth thoſe that are deſirous to be vertuous, not to vſe any kind of Muſick or Inſtruments, which may allure and intice them to wickednes. The Lawes of Egipt ſuffered not, as Plato ſaith, any thing to be ſung within Egipt, vnleſſe they which gouerned the Common-wealth, had firſt examined the thing to be ſung, and with what Muſick they ſhold ſing it. It is likelie that it woulde be very profitable for euerie Common-wealth, not to allow ſongs and ballads or Muſick to be ſung in the Cittie, which may intice men to diſhoneſtie, and it were very good that, that diligence which Magiſtrates take in ſuffering no bookes to be printed, or pictures to be drawne, that may endomage or hurte the ſtate of the Realme, were alſo had, in examining thoſe kinds of Muſick and ditties, which are vſed in the Common-wealth: for Muſicke béeing a diuine gift, which eaſilie mooueth mortall harts, if men were accuſtomed to ſing holie Pſalmes and honeſt Sonets, it woulde no doubt, draw men from folowing of vanity and wickednes, to embrace vertue and honeſtie. In auncient times paſt, the Prieſtes and Prophets, to applie themſelues the better to diuine thinges, vſed Muſick, as King Dauid did, and the Prophet Elizeus, and among the Gentiles, Prophets and Philoſophers were Muſitions. How forcible Muſicke is to mooue the harts of men, may be ſéene in children, who when they crie, are appeaſed and quieted with Muſick: and in men alſo vpon whom God beſtowed (as Quintilian ſaith) the benefit of Muſick, with it the more eaſily to forget their labors, and by it to be perſwaded to doo that which is ſung vnto them. And for this cauſe diuers kindes of Muſicke applied to that which is ſung, is vſed in feaſts, playes, banquets, wars, ſolemnities and funerals. The Poets fayned that Amphion and Orpheus, two great Muſitions of Thracia,
                  
with the ſweete harmonie of their Muſick, builded the walles of their Countrey, drawing after them ſtones, trees, &amp; beaſtes. Theſe fained fables (which ordinarilie betoken ſome thing miſticallie contained in them) giue vs to vnderſtande, that the Philoſophers which firſt eſtabliſhed the liberall Sciences, pollicies and precepts for ciuill behauiour, and learning in theyr Countries, did with their ſweete voice and learned tongues, perſwade the rude &amp; ruſticall people, (which did not much dyffer from ſtones, plants, and beaſtes) to leaue their ſauage kinde of life, and reforme their wilde &amp; brutiſh cuſtoms: &amp; ſo brought them vnder Lawes and pollitique gouernment. But not to wade too farre from the purpoſe, let vs return vnto Plato, who though he affirme that it is a thing very dangerous for the gouernment of each eſtate, that Muſicke ſhould be altered in the Common-wealth, (for by it the cuſtoms be altered, which béeing altered, the gouernment is ſoone changed.)

But we muſt vnderſtand, that which Plato ſaith, after the ſame order as Ariſtotle dooth, to witte, of that Muſicke which enticeth men to diſhoneſt and vicious actions: as may be gathered out of that which Plato ſaith, that the Gouernours and Prieſtes of Egipt, did examine thoſe pictures and Poemes, which in Egipt were painted and ſung, to the end that honeſtie and vertue ſhould be greatly regarded in them.
               12 The gouernment of a Common-wealth is alſo chaunged by factions, diuiſions of people in ſundry opinions, ſciſmes, and partialities: and euen as terreſtriall bodies grow and periſh: and when there is no outward thing that corrupteth thē, they conſume of themſelues by reaſon of ſome inward corruption: euen ſo Common-weales, when they haue no forraine enemies, they Arme and prepare enemies among themſelues at home, to deſtroy one another. The Emperour Charles the fift, ſaid, that as the ruſt doth eate vp the yron, and the wormes the fruite of the earth, ſo diuiſions doo diſquiet and deſtroy the whole Common-wealth, and alter the gouernment. And thys manner of alteration of gouernments, is the moſt daungerous of all: for as Plato ſaith, it is a moſt greeuous ſicknes, which deſtroieth and maketh many fameus Citties deſolate, which with their owne weapons wage warre againſt themſelues.

This manner of changing the gouernment, is commonly ſeene in thoſe Cōmon-weales, in which there are mightie perſons, that take occaſion to profit thēſelues by the weakenes of thoſe Princes which be cowards and faint harted, or but children vnder protection and cuſtodie of Tutors &amp; Gouerners: for ſuch men procure that place which is néereſt to the Princes to vſurpe their power, and commaund all.

               Theſe and ſuch like pollicies are vſed by the ambitious, when they tirannouſlie vſurpe any kingdome, with which wicked ſleight they winne the fauour and harts of the Common people, that with their helpe, they may execute that which they wickedlie pretend &amp; gréedilie wiſh for: for the malice of a fewe and the ignoraunce of many, haue alwaies diſquieted the Common-weales.
               14 There is no reaſon, why Ariſtotle ſhould reprehend his Maiſter Plato, becauſe in writing howe gouernments are changed, he ſette not downe the eſpeciall and particular cauſe, for the beſt gouernment of all, is changed into another, and the reaſon which Plato vſeth, (to wit, that all created thinges doe alter in time) doth not proue the eſpeciall &amp; proper cauſe of the alteration of the beſt gouernmēt into an other. That Ariſtotle hath no reaſon in this, may be manifeſtly ſéene, in yt it was not Plato his intent, in his bookes De repub. to entreate of ye particular and eſpeciall cauſes why gouernments alter: but of the vniuerſal and common cauſes: for as ſtrong &amp; healthful bodies

fall ſicke for common cauſes: ſo Common-weales (which are mixed bodies) are tranſ-formed and changed by common cauſes. The reuolutions of the heauens, ſuffer nothing to continue ſtill without corruption that are vnder the Orde of the Moone, but all are ſubiect to alteration and corruption: eſpeciallie becauſe thoſe that rule and gouerne Common-weales are frée agents, though notwithſtanding ſome ſaie, that ſéeing that thoſe which gouerne the Common-wealth, are not neceſſary but frée Agents, the naturall Agents ought not to be reſpected: for this doth not hinder that ſome gouernments are more eaſily tranſformed &amp; changed into others, becauſe they be more readie and more diſpoſed to be tranſ-formed into ſome, then into others, whether the cauſes for which they be tranſ-formed and chaunged be vniuerſall or particular. And that Plato in his Bookes De Repub did not ſet downe the particuler cauſes why Common-weales were changed: it was, becauſe hee imagining and ſayning a certaine Common-wealth (the Idea whereof is that, which he writte in his bookes De Repub.) he needed not to ſette downe the particuler cauſes why Common-weales doe alter, ſeeing that the vniuerſall cauſe ſuffiſeth. So that as in healthfull and ſound bodies, the generall cauſes ſuffice to alter their health and ſoundnes: ſo in a perfect Common-welth, the reuolutions of the heauens doo ſuffiſe to alter and change them: and Plato, ſeeing he intreated not particularlie of one eſpeciall kind of gouernment, but generally of the Idaea or example of all Common-weales: he needed not to ſette downe the eſpeciall and particular cauſes, why the gouernments change and alter: for ſeeing, as we haue ſaid, that thoſe which change them are free Agents, it ſuffiſed to ſette downe the generall and common cauſes for to ſhew how they are chaunged, becauſe the particular &amp; ſpeciall cauſes of the alteration of gouernments, though they procéede from frée Agents, yet they be reduced vnto common and vniuerſall cauſes. By this is concluded, that though the Kingdome and Tyrannie be contraries, and (as Ariſtotle ſaith) differ greatlie, yet neuertheleſſe, a kingdome is ſoonerLib. 8.

The ſubiect is, that thoſe which gouerne be one, a few, or manie: the end is, that the Commonwealth ſhould be well gouerned: and the intent is, that thing which they which rule them doo principallie pretend.

Plato ſaith, that they be the worſe, becauſe he ſpeaketh not of corrupt Common-weales, and naughtie gouernments, but of good Common-weales, and thoſe which imitate the Idaea which he ſetteth down: &amp; reſpecting thoſe Common-weales which are well gouerned, of which be ſpake, he erred not, in ſaying, that thoſe Common-weales which were moſt like to his Idaea, were the beſt: and that thoſe which did leſſe reſemble it were not ſo good, though Ariſtotle

But Plato ſaith well, for he maketh no compariſon of corrupted Common-weales (for hee accounteth not that a Common-weale, which is corrupted) but of good Common-weales of which hee ſpeaketh: and becauſe the kingdomePlato. in Dialo. ciuili vel de reg. or Monarchie is moſt like vnto his Idaea of good gouernmēt, he ſaith, that it is the beſt politie of all, and that the Democracie becauſe it is moſt ſeperated from his Idaea of good gouernment, then all the other, it is the worſt politie of all: and that of allPlato. vbiſupra.

And vnderſtanding that which Plato ſaith after this manner, all Ariſtotles arguments and obiections which hee bringeth againſt him, concerning the gouernments, &amp; tranſ-formations of Common-weales, are vaine: and in effect, Plato ſaid the ſame which Ariſtotle, to wit, that the moſt principall and chéefeſt kinds or diuerſities of gouernment are three, the Monarchie, Oligarchie, and Democracie: and that the Monarchie is the beſt gouernment, and the Democracie the worſt, by reaſon of the vnconſtancie and ſmall ſkil of the people. Tullie affirmeth, that the Sea hath not ſo many tempeſts, daungers &amp; troubles, as the peoples election hath, in which they chooſe, ordaine and eſtabliſh Officers and Magiſtrates to rule and gouerne them. Demoſthenes ſaid, that if he had known the malicious defractions, forged crimes, and craftie inuentions, vnto which they that beare Office in the Common-weales, which are ruled by the people, are ſubiect: and that two waies had béene ſhewed him, the one, to be an Officer and Partaker of the gouernment, and ye other, to incurre preſent death: that hee wold rather haue choſen that way in which there was danger of death, then to be in Office, in a Democracie or Common-wealth gouerned by the people.
               16 The regiments are tranſ-formed and chaunged, ſome into others according to the opinion of Plato, the Monarchie and Kingdome, into the Ariſtocracie, (which hee calleth the ambitious gouernment, becauſe they that gouerne, deſire and couet honours:) the Ariſtocracie, is tranſlated into the Oligarchie, which is when a few gouerne, whoſe principall intent is, to be rich: this eſtate is not ſo good as the ambitious gouernment, for honor and glory is preferred before riches: and the Oligarchie is changed into the Democracie. Ariſtotle ſayth, that gouernments are altered, either becauſe they which preuaile moſt, and are of greateſt power, oppreſſe the people, or becauſe they which are rich and of greateſt authoritie, will not ſuffer others, though they be rich and honoured, to gouerne the Common-wealth: or becauſe there are factions &amp; partialities among thoſe that gouerne, which of them ſhall be the chéefeſt:

or becauſe they that gouerne, will expell others that do gouern, from the gouernment: or becauſe ſome of thoſe that gouerne, take aduantage by the fauour of the people, for to tyrannize ouer the Common-wealth. Polibius is of that opinion, that mē after they aſſembled together, liued polliticklie in ciuill gouernment, and chooſe ſome that had moſt credit and authorityPlat. vbi ſupra. EX quo patet tyrannum ex radice tutoris naſci, &amp; Ariſt. Polit. 5. cap. 5. maxima feré ex parte veteres tyranni &amp;c. vt ſupra. among them, to rule and defend them. And theſe afterwards of Tutors and defenders, became Traytors and Tyrants, and the cheefeſt of thē not being able to ſuffer the tyrannie of thoſe their naughtie Gouernours, diſpoſſeſſed thē of the gouernment, and tranſlated it vnto themſelues, making it an Ariſtocracie, which kinde of gouernment was after the ſame order in time tranſ-formed into an Oligarchie. This diſcourſe of Polibius, concerning the alteration &amp; tranſmutation of Common weales, is like to that which ſome men ſay of riches and pouertie, affirming that pouertie maketh men laborious, induſtrius, &amp; glad to trauaile and take paines, by which diligence and induſtrie, they attaine to riches, by them they become vicious &amp; wicked, and ſo by reaſon of their wickednes, at length they fall into pouertie againe: which conſtraineth them to take paines and be induſtrius as they were before.
