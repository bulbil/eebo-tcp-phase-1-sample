            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               MOST MIGHTY MONARCH▪ 
                  and MY DREAD SOVERAIGNE.
            
            
               SEeing that it hath pleaſed You to examine the Endeavours of thoſe formerly imployed towards the ſearch of the North-west Paſſage, and that it hath bin Your Highneſſe pleaſure, to examine me Your meaneſt Subject, concerning the hope of a further Diſcoverie, how it formerly had fayled; and what better helpes could now be produced, appointing me Your Highneſſe Pinnace the CHARLES, with Your Royall Inſtructions for my better proceeding, which unto me was the greateſt Honour that ever Subject received, (and at my Returne continuing Your Royall and Gracious favour, commanding me unto Your Royall Preſence to deliver my Accompts;) hath ſince imboldened me to examine with my ſelfe thus farre, that hereby

(as duty obligeth) I might bring ſome better ſatisfaction to your Royall demand; which was, Whether there were a Paſſage or no, and were I capable thereof at my being neere the ſame? But ſince that meditation and contemplation hath given me more inſight thereinto, than Speculation at that inſtant could; For it was not poſſible for me to frame any Concluſion, untill I had circuted the Bay of Hudſon and Button, whereby I might find from whence a new Tyde (which I found there) ſhould come; and heere SIR, I proſtrate my Accompt in particular, which then I preſented in generall.
            I begin with King ARTHVR his Conqueſts, and ſo proceeds to all thoſe Diſcoveries (that I can find Antiquity hath preſerved) towards the North-west, untill this Your owne time; to ſhow, how thoſe Maynes, Ilands, and Continents, they have diſcovered, doth like dew from Heaven deſeend upon Your Royall Throne; ſo as moſt Dread Soveraigne, the true Right thereto is Yours, which I pray may be augmented unto the furtheſt bounds of the Eaſt and W. Ocean.
            I doe not onely bring to ſhow, but put your Majeſty in mind of what you know: knowing that your Majeſty being called by more weighty affaires of State, may paſſe by (unremembred) ſuch ſmall Trifles as this; yet obſerving Your Highneſſe willingneſſe to promote Navigation and thoſe diſcovering Enterpriſes, hath made me thus preſume.
            I have endeavored the probability of a Paſſage, praying unto Almighty GOD, to ſet it as a faire Iewell in your Royall Crowne, and bring to paſſe in thoſe happie dayes which wee doe enjoy under your Gracious and godly Gouernment; Rather than ſome Forraigne Prince or State, ſhould advance and finde the ſame. Theſe ſhall bee the prayers, with Your long life and proſperous Raigne,

                  GENTLE READER, expect not heere any floriſhing Phraſes or Floquent tearmes, for this Child of mine begot in the North-weſts cold Clime, (where they breed no Schollers,) is not able to digeſt the ſweet milke of Rethorick, that's food for them▪ the Parent not being able to maintaine it any longer, it being now paſt the Cradle, hopes, the Publike will willingly beſtow Education of the Infant for his better breeding; for which the Father prayeth, and the rather becauſe the Midwife perſwades him that the Child lookes like himſelfe, there were ſome deſired to have had him come abroad like the Lapwing, before the ſhell was from over his head, but the Nurſe more carefull of the tenderly borne Infant procraſtinated the time, ſuppoſing that after birth it would ſtrengthen apace in this temporate Clime, and in time be the better able to Iourney; but in Concluſion its turned to Diſcoverie, not of a Paſſage but of the way to find one, to come to the

               an, If there be a Paſſage how chance hee hath not found it, if not, why doe they ſearch after it; and in fine, hath hee made a Voyage or no, the meaning of this laſt I know not, nor I thinke they neither; but for that the moſt deſire to know what I have done, and how farre I have bin; I anſwer as the Old women tells tales, Further and further than

I doe confeſſe, that they have not done me much amiſſe in cauſing me to ſhow my ſelfe; for hereby they ſhall know, that before this vndertaking I was not ignorant of what my predeceſſors had done before I came, which was no ſmall helpe both to my ſafety and proceeding. For ſome will Calumniate out of malice, ſome for that they diſlike all things but what themſelves or friends doth; but I hope the judiciall Sea-man will ſtand in my defence: For amongst thoſe inquiſitors, eſpecially the never-ſatisfied-curious, I finde few that doth or will know what they inquire after, other having other imployments reſts content with the verball Report of their owne Times, rather than looke after the La

            It will be obiected, that many of theſe Abſtracts are taken out of other Bookes, and that thoſe are the Voyages of other men; I anſwer it is true, the moſt of them are. For what are all thoſe of Mr. Hackl

For in ſearching thou ſhalt finde, that the workes of many brave men are buried in oblivion, whoſe Names are devolved and but ſomething brought vnto vs through the ſucceſsion of Ages, and though part of thoſe workes have eſcaped, the wracke of the rest have periſhed in the Gulfe of time, which hath ſwallowed the beſt of many mens endeavors, and for thoſe extant▪ thou canſt not come vnto without labour and charge, all which I have brought to thy hands almoſt for nothing, conſidering the charge of Bookes of great priſe, the labour in ſearch and Quotations; beſides, heere

is much that never came in Print as yet, being very difficult to be had. And though I have abſtracted thoſe Workes of my Predeceſſors, yet I have interlaced my owne experience, and beene curious not to leave out any thing of theirs or my owne, wherein I could thinke my remembrance might avayle thee. And although wee all have ſometimes ſtumbled, yet wee may bee excuſed, conſidering the long and ſtrange Iourney wee had to goe, and who followeth doth but perſevere by our example, nor have I like the Poet feigned a Storme where I had none: Nor doe I hold that man fit to take charge of Voyages remote, eſpecially Northeaſt or Weſtward, and be Ignorant of thoſe Abſtracts and Iournals following. For I know, knowledge will conceive them to be good Preparatives. Howſoever in them I have done my beſt, and whoſoever will amend them, I ſhall take him for my friend, I have reſtored all the names of Capes, Headlands, and Ilands formerly given by Captaine DAVIS, Mr HVDSON, and Sir THOMAS BVTTON, (which ſince have beene infringed vpon) vnto their firſt appellations, both in my Booke and Map.

Moone and Starres for long ſeaſon, they will then thinke that they onely dreamed before, when they imagined of the Courſe of the Seas, and that their Bookes were but weake Schoolemaſters, that the talke of Art were farre ſhort of the Practice, when at beholding the Starres which they thought to have vſed as guides and directions▪ ſeeme now as they threatned their ruine and deſtruction; nay, when you ſhall looke forth and tremble at the riſing of every wave, and ſhall be agaſt with feare to refraine thoſe Rockes and dangers which lye hid within the Seas faireſt boſome, together with the greatneſſe of the Ocean, and ſmalneſſe of their Ship; for want of experience to handle, not knowing how to ſhun, they will then thinke that the leaſt gale is of force to overthrow them, and know that Art muſt be taught to practice by long and induſtrious vſe. For it is not enough to be a Sea-man, but to be a painefull Sea-man; for a Seabred man of reaſonable Capacity, may attaine to ſo much Art as may ſerve to Circle the Earths Globe about, but the other wanting the experimentall part cannot▪ for I doe not allow any to be a good Sea man, that hath not vndergone the moſt Offices about a Ship, and that his youth hath bin both taught and inured to all labours; for to keepe a warme Cabbin &amp; lye in ſheets, is the moſt ignoble part of a Sea man, but to endure and ſuffer; as a hard Cabbin, cold and ſalt Meate, broken ſleepes, mould bread, dead beere, wet Cloathes, want of fire, all theſe are within board; beſides Boate, Lead, Topyardes, Anchor-morings and the like.

            CERTAINE TESTIMOnies concerning King Arthur and his Conqueſts of the North regions, taken by Mr. Hacklute out of the Hiſtories of the Kings of Brittaine; written by Galfridus Monamutenſis, newly Printed at Hedleberg, 1587.
            
               Lib. 9. Cap. 10.
               
                  IN the yeare of CHRIST, 517. King Arthur in the ſecond yeare of his raigne, having ſubdued all parts of Ireland, ſayled with his Fleet into Iſeland, and brought it and the people thereof into ſubjection; the rumour being ſpred throughout all the other Lands, that no Countrey was able to withſtand him; Doldanius, King of Gotland, and Gunfacius the King of Orkney, came voluntary unto him, and yeelded their obedience, promiſing to pay him Tribute. The winter being ſpent, hee returned into Britaine; eſtabliſhed his Kingdome in perfect peace; he continued there for the ſpace of twelue yeares.
            
            
               Lib. 9. Cap. 12.
               After that, King Arthur ſending his Meſſengers into divers Kingdomes, hee ſummoned ſuch as were to come to his Court, aſwell out of France, as out of the adjacent Ilands of the Sea, and a little after: from theſe adjacent Ilands came Guillaumarius King of Ireland, Malvatius King of Iſeland, Doldunus King of Gotland, Gunnotius King of Orkney, Lot the King of Norway, and Archilius King of Denmarke.
               
            
            
               
               A teſtimony of the Right and Appendances of the Crowne of the Kingdome of Brittaine, taken out of Mr. Lambert, Fol. 137. pag. 2.
               ARTHVR which was ſometimes the moſt renowned King of the Britaines, was a mighty valiant and famous Warriour. This Kingdome was too little for him and his minde was not contented with it; hee therefore valiantly ſubdue

                   of his Brittiſh Empire, and many other Ilands beyond Norway even under the Pole, which are appendances of Scantia now called Norway; he planted the Chriſtian Faith throughout all Norway, matched their Nobility with Brittiſh bloud, called Norway the Chamber of Brittaine, and incorporated them unto us.
            
            
               Another teſtimony out of Galfridus Monumetenſis concerning the Conqueſt of Malga King of England, Lib. 11. cap. 7.
               MALGO ſucceeded Vorciporius which was the goodlieſt man in perſon of all Brittaine, a Prince that expulſed many Tyrants, hee was ſtrong and valiant in warre, taller then moſt men that then lived, and exceeding famous for his vertues. This King alſo obtained the Government of the whole Iland of Brittaine, and by moſt ſharpe battailes he recovered to his Empire the ſixe Ilands of the Ocean Sea, which were before Tributaries to King Arthur; namely, Ireland, Iſeland, Gotland, Orkney, Norway, and Denmarke.
               
            
            
               The Voyage of Octher to the Northeaſt parts beyond Norway, reported by himſelfe vnto Alfred the famous King of England, about the yeare. 890.
               OCTHER ſayd, that the Countrey wherein he dweit was called Helgoland, hee told his Lord King Elfreed, that he

dwelt furtheſt North of any Norman, he ſayd, that he dwelt towards the North part of the Land towards the Weſt coaſt. And in another place hee affirmeth, that there was no man dwelling towards the North from him, and a

                  lirmed the land to ſtretch farre to the North, yet all Deſert, and not inhabited. Vpon a time, he fell into a fancy to know how farre the Land ſtretched Northward, whereupon hee tooke his voyage directly North, along the Coaſt having alwayes the Deſert land upon his Sta

Thus much for Octher, whom it appeares was the ſecond that doubled the North Cape that we have extant, King Arthur being the firſt.
               Although I know, heere is ſomething that will not bee beleeved, yet I will proceed, ſeeing that the more and further

I doe goe on, I finde ſome reaſon to have better confidence of the former, and thus much, &amp;c.
            
            
               Therefore as followeth, out of the Comments of Arngrinus, Fitz Ionus. 1598.
               
               A Certaine Writer ſayth, hee hath put downe the diſtance betweene the mouth of Elbe and Baczend in the South part of Iſeland, to be 400. leagues; from whence if you will accompt the difference of Longitude, to the Meridian of Hambrough, Iſeland muſt have none of the Longitudes accompted of, as 5. 7. 6. 20. 30. 28. 325. according to ſeverall Authors, for I am able to prove by 3. ſeverall Voyages of Hamburgers, that it is but 7. dayes ſayle from Iſeland to Hambrough, beſides all the Ilands which for the abundance of Sheepe are called Farrier; as likewiſe the Deſert ſhoares of Norway, are diſtant from us but two dayes ſayling, wee have 4. dayes ſayling into habitable Groenland, and almoſt in the ſame quantity of time, wee paſt over to the Province of Norway called St

                     d, lying betweene the Townes of Oridroſia or Trondon, and Bargon, as we find by antient Records of thoſe Nations.
               
                  Iſeland hath bin called by three names one after another; for one Nuddocus a Norvegian borne, who is thought to bee the firſt Diſcoverer thereof, as he was ſayling towards Farra Ilands, through a violent Tempeſt did by chance arrive at the Eaſt ſhore of Iſeland, where beholding the Mountaines tops covered with Snow, called this Iland Snowland.
               
               After this one Gardarus, being moved with Nuddocus reports, went to ſeeke, and when hee had found, hee called it Garders Ile.
               After theſe two, one Flok went into this Land, and named it after the Ice hee found there, Iceland.
               
               This land hath ſome yeares no Ice at all, as in 1592. but the Sea is open for moſt yeares from Aprill to Ianuary, and in May all is driven to the Weſt, and this Land hee inhabited about the yeare of our Lord, 874.
               In the yeare 1591. there was a Ship of Germany lay laden with Copper 14. dayes in the harbour of Vopnaford; in November ſhe ſet ſayle and departed; this was ſome ſhip of the Balticke Sea, or Hambrough, which durſt not goe through the Narrow ſeas for Spaine.
               
               
                  The Commentor Arngrinus ſayth, in the yeare of Chriſt 874. Iſeland being indeed diſcovered before that time, as is aboue mentioned was the firſt of all inhabited by certaine Norvegians, their Chieftaine, was one Ingulphus, from whoſe name the Eaſt Cape of Iſeland is called Ingul

Therefore the Norvages with their company, peopled all the habitable places of Iſeland.
               
            
            
               The voyages of the Brethren Mr. Nicolo and Anthonie Zeni Venotians, collected out of their owne Letters by Mr. Franciſco Maritino.
               
               
                  NIcolas cauſed a ſhip to be made ready at his owne charge in Italy 1380. with intent to ſee England and Flanders, but was by tempeſt caſt vpon the Ile of Freeſland, where he had beene cruelly entreated, had it not beene for Zichmni, Lord of certaine Ilands, called Porland, lying on the South of Freeſland, being rich and populous, he was alſo Duke of Sorany lying ouer againſt Scotland.
               
               This Prince being arrived vpon Freeſland to make warre vpon the ſame, vnderſtanding the ſhipwracke came preſently, and hearing by the Latine tongue that he was of Italy, he received him into protection with great ioy.
               This Prince having the laſt yeare, given the overthrow to the King of Norway in ſome of his Signiories, was come to Frieſland alſo to take the ſame from the ſaid King whereof he was Lord, and to that purpoſe, vnderſtanding that Mr. Nicolo had great judgement, in Sea and Martiall affaires, he gaue him commiſſion, to goe aboord his ſhips, commanding the

Captaine to honour him in all things, and to vſe his counſell: his Nauie conſiſted of 30. ſaile, whereof two rowed with Oares.
               With theſe ſmall Barkes, and one ſhip, they 
                     •
                  ailed to the Weſtward and won Ledovo and Ilofe, and divers other ſmall Ilands, and turned into a Bay called Sudero; in the Hauen of the Towne called Samſtoll, they tooke certaine ſmall Barkes laden with fiſh.
               Here they found Zichmni who came thither by land conquering all the Country, they ſailed to the W. by another Cape or Gulfe, and conquered all the Ilands they found to the Signorie of Zichmn
                        •
                     . Theſe Seas for as much as they ſailed, were in manner nothing but ſhoales and Rockes, ſo as it was thought amongſt them, that the fleete had periſhed, if it had not beene for the skill and knowledge of Mr. Nicolo and his men, who had beene brought vp in the practiſe of Nauigation all their liues.
               At the counſell of Mr. Anthonie they goe on Land, when they heard of the good ſucceſſe of Zichmni in his warres, and that all the Iland by Embaſſadors was yeilded vnto him.
               At their meeting, the Prince gaue Mr. Nicolo the honour of Knighthood, &amp; graced him as the preſeruer of his fleete, and rewarded his men. In Triumphant manner they goe towards Frieſland, the chiefe Citty thereof is ſcituate on the S. E. ſide within a Gulfe or Bay, as there are many in that Iland; in this Gulfe or Bay is ſuch abundance of fiſh taken, that many ſhips are laden to ſerue Flanders, Brittaine, England, Scotland, Norway, and Denmarke.
               
            
            
               Thus much is taken out of a Letter that Mr. Nicolo ſent to his Brother Anthonie, requeſting that he would ſeeke ſome meanes to come to him.
               MAſter Anthonie furniſht a ſhip, and after great danger with great joy arrived with his Brother, where he remained 14. yeares, 4. yeares with his Brother and 10. yeares alone, where they ſo behaued themſelues, that Nicolo was made Captaine of Z

ſhoales, where a great part of their Fleete was caſt away. The King of Denmarke comming to reſcue Eſtland, his Fleete vtterly periſhed, which Zichmni having notice of by a ſhip of the Enemies, he determines to ſet vpon Iſeland.
               
               Which together with the reſt, was ſubiect to the King of Norway, but he finding the Country well fortified, his ſmall Fleete were glad to retire; In the ſame channels he aſſaulted the other Iles, called Iſeland; which are 7. Talas, Broas, Heance, Trans, Mimant, Dambere, and Breſt; and having ſpoiled them all, hee built a Fort in Breſt, where he left Mr. Nicolo with men, ſmall Barkes, and Munition, and with the few ſhips he had left, he returned to Frieſland.

                   moſt part are of Iſeland. There are continually in that part many Barkes, which are kept there by reaſon of the Sea being froze, waiting for the Spring to diſſolue the Ice. Their Boates are made like vnto Weavers ſhuttles, taking the skins of fiſhes, and ſowing them together in many doubles, they faſhion them with the bones of the ſame fiſh, and make them ſo ſure and ſubſtantiall, that it is marvailous to ſee, how

in tempeſts they will ſhut themſelues cloſe with in, and let the ſea and wind carry them they care not whither, without either breaking or drowning, and if they chance to be driven vpon the Rocks, they remaine ſound without any bruiſe at all, and they haue as it were a ſleeue in the bottome which is tyed faſt in the middle, and when there commeth any water into the Boat, they put it into the one halfe of the ſleeue, then faſtening the end with two peeces of wood, and looſening the band beneath, they convay the water forth of the Boat, and this they doe as often as they have occaſion.
               Moreover, this Water is of a Sulphurous brimſtone nature, and is conveyed into veſſels of Braſſe, Tinne, and Stone, and ſo imployed to all vſes, to warme their houſes, or boile their meate without any ſtinke, or noiſome ſmell. The Friers of this Monaſtery ſpeake all the Latine tongue, and this is all that then was knowne of Engroneland.
               
               Mr. Nicolo: dyed in Frieſland, and being dead Anthonie ſucceeded him both in Goods and Dignitie, and albeit he attempted and made great ſupplication, yet could he not obtaine licence to returne to his Countrey. For Zichmni intended to make himſelfe Lord of the Sea, vſed his counſell, and determined to ſend him with divers Barkes to the Weſt-wards; for that certaine Fiſhermen of his, had diſcovered certaine Ilands very rich and populous, which diſcovery Mr. Anthony in a Letter to his Brother Carolo recounteth thus:
            
            
               SIx and twenty yeares ſince, there departed 4. fiſher Boates,Eſtotoland the which a mighty tempeſt, toſſed too &amp; fro divers dayes, when at length they diſcovered, an Iland called Eſtotoland, lying Weſt-ward above 1000. miles from Freeſland, vpon which, one of the Boates was caſt away, and the 6. men therein were taken and carried to a faire and populous City, where the King ſent for many Interpreters, but none could vnderſtand their language, but one who ſpoake Latine, who was alſo caſt there by chance, who vnderſtanding their caſe, rehearſed it to the King, who cauſed thē to ſtay in his Country 3. yeares, in which time they learned the Language: one of them was in divers parts of the Iland, and reports it to be Rich and aboundeth with all Commodities of the world, it is little leſſe then Iſeland, but farre more fruitfull, in the middle

is a Mountaine, from whence there Springs 4. Rivers that paſſe through the whole Countrey.
               The Inhabitants are very witty people, and have all Arts and faculties as we have, and it is credible that in times paſt, they have had traffique with our men; for be ſaid, he ſaw Latine bookes in the Kings Library, which at that preſent they did not underſtand, they have a peculiar language and letters or characters to themſelves, they have Mines of all manner of mettals, but they abound with Gold; they have trade in Engroneland, from whence they bring Furres, Brimſtone, and Pitch, he ſaith, that to the Southward, there is a great populous country very rich in gold, they ſow Corne, and make Beere and Ale, and uſe it as we do wine, they have mighty great woods, there are many Cities and Caſtles. They build ſmall Barkes, and have ſayling, but they have not the Loadſtone, nor know not the uſe of the Compaſſe; wherefore the Fiſhers were had in great eſtimation, inſomuch that the King ſent them Southward to a country they call Dorgio, but in that voyage they had ſuch weather, that they thought to have periſhed in the ſea, but eſcaping that, they fell into another more cruell, for they were taken in the Country and the moſt part of themMan eaters. eaten of the Salvage people, which fed upon Mans fleſh as the ſweeteſt meat.
               But this Fiſherman eſcaped, by teaching them to take fiſh with nets, in the Sea and in freſh rivers, whereby he was honoured and beloved of all.
               The Lords of the Country fell out about him, and in 13. yeares he was there, he was ſent to at leaſt 25. of them from one to another, to teach his Art of Fiſhing, ſo that he was in all parts of the Country; which he ſaith, is very great, the people very rude, and voide of goodneſſe, they all goe naked, neither have they wit to cover their bodies with the skins of beaſts they take by hunting, whereby they are miſerably vexed with cold, they have Lances, ſharpe at the point, they have Bowes, and ſtrings made of beaſt skins, they are a cruell people, and have certaine lawes amongſt themſelves; to Southwards the people have more civility, the aire being more temperate, and have Cities and Temples with Idols, there they ſacrifice men to Idols, and afterwards eate them, they have ſome knowledge of gold and ſilver.
               
                  Now this Fiſherman had an intent to get home, but his companions being in deſpaire thereof, never offered to attempt their freedome, and therefore ſtayed there; whereupon he travailed through the woods towards Dorgio, the next Lord knew him, and he was conveyed from one to another, untill at length he came to Dorgio, where he ſtayed three yeares, and hearing of divers Boates that were arrived there, he went to the ſea ſide, and asking of whence they were, they ſaid of Eſtotiland, he being glad, requeſted to be entertained by them, and carried to their country, which they gladly granted and uſed him for their Interpretor.
               After that, he frequented that trading with them and became very rich, wherewith he furniſhed a barke, returned into Friezeland, and to his Lord made this report of that wealthy Country.
               He is credited here, for that the Mariners doe affirme his reports to be true, wherefore this Lord is reſolved to ſend me forth with a fleete toward theſe parts, but it was not ſo; for Z

Therefore it is to be ſuppoſed, that he and his people inhabited part of this Country; for it appeareth by Francis Lopez de Gomara, that in Acuzamill and other places, the people honored the Croſſe, whereby it may be gathered, that Chriſtians had beene there before the comming of the Spaniards.

In the beginning of Summer, I begun to ſaile North-weſt, not thinking to find any other Land then that of Cataia, and from thence to come into India.

Degree vnder the Pole▪ and ſeeing that there the Coaſt turned toward the Eaſt, diſpairing to find the paſſage, I turned backe againe, and ſailed downe by the Coaſt of that Land toward the Equinoctiall.

King of England, and he advertiſed me, that having ſailed along time Weſt by North, beyond thoſe Ilands into the Latit. of 67. Deg. and ½. vnder the North Pole; and on the 11. day of Iune, finding ſtill the open Sea, without any impediment, he thought verily by that way, to have paſſed on ſtill to Cataia, which is in the Eaſt, and would have done it, if the Mutinie of the ſhipmaſters and Marriners, had not hindered, and made him returne home, from that place.

               IN the yeare of Grace 1497. John Cabot a Ʋenetian and Sebaſtian his Sonne, with an Engliſh Fleete, ſet from Briſtow, diſcovered that Iland which before that time, no man had attempted, on the 24. day of June, this Land he called Prima Veſta, that is to ſay, firſt ſeene; that Iland lying out before the Land, he called the Ile of St. John: Becauſe he diſcovered it vpon that day of St. John Baptiſt. The inhabitants of this Ile, vſe to weare Beaſts skinnes, in their Warres they vſe Bowes, Arrowes, Pikes, Darts, Wooden-clubs, and ſlings: The ſoile is Barren in ſome places, and yeeldeth little fruit; but is full of white Beares, and Stagges, farre greater then ours, it yeildeth plenty of Fiſh, and theſe very great, as Seales and Sammons, there are Soales of a yard in length, but eſpecially, there is great plenty of that kind of Fiſh, which the Salvages call Baccalaos, there are alſo bred Hawkes and Eagles.

               Sir Martin Frobriſher his 2. Voyage. 1577.
               DEparted from Blackwall the 26. of May, with 3. ſhips,May. to wit, the Aide of the Queenes, burthen 180. Tonnes, the Michaell, and the Gabriell, accompanied with 140. Gentlemen, Soldiers, and Saylers, victualed for halfe a yeare.
               He went by the North the 7. of June, arrived at Orkney, inJune. the Iles of Scotland. 8. He departs from thence, ſailes betwixt W. and N. W. vntill the 4. of July, 26. dayes ſaile; from thence they meete with much Drift-wood, as they ſuppoſe from New found Land: And driven over with the Current, which they ſay, ſets from the W. to the Eaſt.
               The 4. of Iuly, they had ſight of Frieſland, 10. or 12. leagues off, and great ſtore of Ice, 30. or 40. Fatham aboue water, theyJuly. ſuppoſed on ground; though they could ſcarce ſound the bottome for depth. The Generall attempteth to goe on Land but cannot: they coaſt it 4. dayes; ſees no ſigne of habitation.
               Yet by Birds which in Fogs had loſt the land &amp; came to the Ships; they ſuppoſe the Country to be more habitable within, then outward ſhoare maketh ſhew or ſignification.
               The 8. they depart from thence. 16. He comes to the making of the Land, named the yeare before by him, the Queenes Forland, being as they judge it, an Iland lying neere the ſuppoſed continent of America: Another Iland lying upon the Aſian ſide, called Halls Iland; betwixt which two Ilands, goeth in Frobriſhers ſtraights, or the unknowne paſſage into the Sea of Sur. He doth ſuppoſe that the Ice of this Coaſt is carried by ſome contrary E. or W. tyde or current, upon the Coaſt of Freezland: cauſing that Country to be farre more intemperate; than other countries farre more North.
               At their firſt entrance, they found the Straight mured with Ice, the Captaine with his Pinnace paſt twice through, before he durſt hazzard in the great Ships.
               They goe on land, the people ſeemed to be joyfull thereof, they embrace▪ and the Captaine laid hands on them; but they eſcape through nimbleneſſe▪ and defends themſelves with their bowes and Arrowes; he tooke one, all the reſt eſcaped.
               
                  They put their Ships into the Straights all full of Ice, they made 14. bourds in one watch, to refraine the Ice, the lightneſſe of the night did them much comfort and helpe for ſight, and this hazard they made for ſafegard of their Captaine and Maſter who were on land.
               17. Being the day following, the Capt. came on board with report of great riches hid in the bowels of that Continent.
               Within 3. or 4. dayes after, they had been in the Streights,July. the W. and N. W. winds diſpierſt the Ice. The 19. they enter without impediment. The 20. they found a good harbour,Iackman Mrs. Mate.
                   and names it Iackmans Sound, anchoring the Ships there.
               The Generall marches up into the land, takes poſſeſſion in the Queenes name, and imployes his men about the buſineſſe they came thither for.
               Whileſt they continued in this harbour, they kept watch continually with boates and roapes ready to hale and towe away the Ice, which otherwiſe might have driven thwart the Ships with Ebbe and flood.
               The Generall findes not commodity anſwerable to his Expectation in the ſuppoſed America: leaves the Ships; coaſts on to the ſuppoſed Aſia, the ſtones on land and Sand in Sea ſparkle like Gold on both ſides, (if all be Gold that glyſters) upon the Weſt ſhore they found a dead Fiſh floating, it proved by the horne to be a Sea Vnicorne; the Spiders put thereinSea Vnicorne. dyed.

               The man Salvage formerly taken and ſhe brought together, every man with ſilence deſired to behold the manner of their meeting, the which was more worth the beholding then can well be expreſſed; At their firſt ſight they beheld each the other very wiſtly a good ſpace, without ſpeech or word vttered, with great change of Colour and Countenance, as though it ſeemed the griefe of their Captivitie had taken away the vſe of their tongues, the Woman at firſt very ſoddainly, as though ſhe diſdained or regarded not the man, turned away, and began to ſing as though ſhe minded another matter, but being againe brought together, the Man broke vp the ſilence firſt, and with a ſterne and ſtayed countenance, began to tell a long ſolemne tale to the woman, wherevnto ſhe gave good hearing, and interrupted him nothing till he had finiſhed, and afterwards being growne into more familiar acquaintance by ſpeech, they were turned together, ſo that I thinke the one would hardly have lived without the comforts of the other, and for ſo much as we could perceiue; albeit they lived continually together, yet they did never vſe as man and wife, though the woman ſpared not to doe all neceſſary things that appertaine to a good huſwife, i

               I have ſent you by theſe bearers, Pen, Inke and Paper to write back againe, if perſoally you can, come to ſatisfie me of their eſtate.
               Here their Captive being on ſhore, ſet up 5. ſmall ſtickes in a Circle one by another, with a ſmall bone placed in the

middeſt, they conceited thereby, he would give his Countrimen to underſtand, that for 5. men betrayed the laſt yeare he was taken priſoner, which hee ſignified by the bone in the middeſt; for afterwards, wee ſhowed him the Picture of his Countryman which the laſt yeare was brought into England, whoſe counterfeit was drawne with his Boate and furniture, both as he was in his owne and alſo Engliſh apparell, hee was upon the ſodaine much amazed thereat, and beholding adviſedly the ſame with ſilence a good while, as though he would ſtraine curteſie, whether ſhould begin the ſpeech (for hee thought him no doubt, a living creature) at length began to queſtion with him, as with his Companion, and finding him dumbe and mute, ſeemed to ſuſpect him as one diſdainfull, and would with a little helpe have growne into choller at the matter, untill at laſt by feeling and handling, he found him but a deceived Picture, and than with great noyſe and cryes ceaſed not to wonder, thinking that we could make men live or dye at our pleaſure.
               They alſo make ſignes they have a King carried on mensA King. ſhoulders, a man farre ſurpaſſing any of ours in bignes and ſtature. It may be thought they are vſed to traffique with ſome other Nation; yet for all this faire dealing they lay lurking to betray our men, with divers ſignes and raw fleſh, which we got, and it ſerved for meate for the man and woman, whoſe ſtomackes as yet could not digeſt the Shippes victuals; One amongſt them counterfeited himſelfe

                  ame, who being ſhot at with a Calliver to affright him, he preſently tooke to his legges and runne away; but in all this time they cannot heare of their men.
               Their weapons are Bowes, Arrowes, ſlings and darts, they have 2. ſorts of Boats, the one is for one man and cloſe deckt, ſhaped like a Weavers ſhuttle; the other open and will carryGreat Canoes. 14. men more or leſſe; and planckt with Seale skinnes.
               It is thought that their habitation in Winter is farre within the land, and that they abide here in Summer onely to live upon Fiſh.
               The 24. of Auguſt after they had ſatisfied their minds and laden their Shippes, they depart, falls with the lands end of England and puts into Milford haven in the Admirall.
               The 2. barkes were ſeparated at Seaby ſtorme; the one arrived

at Briſtow: the other came about Scotland, and arrived ſafely at Yarmouth. In this voyage they loſt two men; Queene Elizabeth named the land Meta incognita.
               
            
            
               Things Remarkeable in this ſecond Voyage.
               THey are men of large Corporature, good proportion, and of colour not much unlike the Sunne-burnt Country man. They weare their haire ſomething long, cut diſorderly before, their women weare their haire long, knit up with two loopes, ſome of them Races their cheekes, chins, and faces, whereupon they lye a colour like darke Azure.
               They eate all their meate Raw, as fleſh, fiſh, fowle, or but lightly perboyled, with water and bloud they will eate Ice as we doe Suger.
               For neceſſity, they will eate graſſe like bruit beaſts, without table or ſtoole, and when their hands are imbrued in blood they licke them cleane with their tongues.
               They yoke their Dogs for uſe, as wee doe Oxen, and when they grow old they fatten them to eate, and if they dye they doe the like.
               They apparell themſelves in skins of Beaſts &amp; Fowle, ſowed together with the ſinewes thereof, to defend them from cold.
               They make their apparell with hoods and tailes, which tailes they beſtow as favours to ratifie any friendſhip ſhowen them, the mens garments are not ſo long as the womens.
               They weare their hoſe cloſe to their legs, from the waſt to the knee without any opening before, as well the one kind as the other, upon their legs they weare hoſe of leather, with the fur-ſide inward 3. paire at once, eſpecially the women, in theſe hoſe they put their neceſſaries they carry about them, they put alſo a bone into their hoſe from the foote to the knee, whereon their hoſe being drawne are held up in place of garters.
               They dreſſe theyr skins very ſoft and ſupple with haire on, in winter they weare the skin-ſide inwards, in Sommer outward, other apparell they have none.
               Their beaſts, fiſhes, and fowles, are all their meate, drinke, apparell, houſes, bedding; and all their Riches.
               Their houſes are tents covered with skins, pitched with quarters foure ſquare, meeting at tops ſewed together with ſinewes,

their entrance is alwayes ore againſt the Sunne.
               They have other ſorts of houſes which they found not to be inhabited, raiſed with ſtones and Whale bones, and covered with skins, the entering not unlike unto an ovens mouth, which they frequent during their hunting time, and ſo leaves them untill they come thither againe.
               They have 2. ſorts of Boates, the one only for one man the other for 16. men, they kill all their fiſh and fleſh with darts, and it may be thought, they repaire to ſome other place to live in winter farther from the Sea ſide, they will eate theyr fleſh and fiſh, ſmell it never ſo filthily, what knowledge they haue of God or what Idoll they adore is unknowne, they make ſignes of people that weare bright plates of Gold in their foreheads. The Country is high and mountainous, great quantity of ſnow lying thereon, there is little plaine ground and no graſſe, but that which is like unto moſſe growing upon ſoft ground ſuch as we get turffe upon. There is no wood at all. There is great quantity of Deere, their skinnes like unto Aſſes, their heads or hornes doe farre exceed any, both in length and breadth of thoſe Countryes, their feete are great as Oxen which meaſured were 7. or 8. inches in breadth, their are alſo Hares, Wolves, fiſhing-Beares, and ſundry ſorts of Sea fowle.

W. parts of America the next yeare: you may be in the foreſaid latitude from England by the firſt of May, and ſo be furniſhed better with men and victuals, to paſſe and proceed in the foreſaid action.
               Seeing then, that you cannot aſſure us of a ſafe harbour to the Northward, wee purpoſe to beare up the helme for England, yet with this limitation, that if in your wiſedome you

being very navigable, with abundance of Fiſh of ſundry ſorts, the Land in all places where I came, ſeemed to bee fertile, according to the Climate wherein it lyeth, for betweene the Mountaines was moſt pleaſant Plaines and Vallies, inſomuch as if he had not ſeene the ſame, hee would not have beleeved, that ſuch a fertile land in ſhew could have bin in thoſe Northerne Regions; there is alſo great ſtore of Fowle, as Ravens, Crowes, Partridges, Pheaſants, Seamewes, Gulls, with other ſorts; of Beaſts he hath not ſeene any, except blacke Foxes of which there are very many. Hee doth ſuppoſe there are alſo many Deere, for about their tents, they found many Hartshornes, with the bones of other beaſts, alſo within the land he ſaw the footing and dung of divers other beaſts, he found the footing of one beaſt to be 8 inches over; in the rivers were Fiſhes, as Seales, Whales, and Salmon, with divers other ſorts of fiſhes; the coaſt is a very good and faire land, for 3 leag. off, he found 15 fathomes, and as he approached the ſame 13, 12, 10 fathomes, very faire ſandy ground. The people are a kind of Samoid or wandering nation, removing from one place unto another, they are people of a reaſonable ſtature, browne of colour, very like the people of the Eaſt and W. India, they are active and warlike, vſing their darts and ſlings very nimbly, they eate their meate raw, or little parboild, with blood, oyle or water; they apparell themſelves in skinnes of ſuch beaſts as they kill, but eſpecially with Seales and fowles, which they can dreſſe very ſoft and ſmooth, in Summer turning the haire and feather ſide outwards, in Winter inwards, their weapons are ſlings, bowes, darts headed with bone or yron, he ſuppoſeth them to be Idolatrous, worſhipping the Sun, he met all the coaſt along much drift wood, but from whence it came he knew not, he coaſted this Coaſt along from 66 deg. to 69 deg. and found many good ſounds and harbours, and returning towards his Shippe which he found in a harbour, by eſpying certaine Worlockes, which the Captaine had cauſed to be ſet as Beacons, for to give him knowledge of their being.

                  GRoenland was firſt ſo named in the yeare of CHRIST, 900. And although I purpoſed, ſaith he, to paſſe over Groenland with ſilence, yet ſeeing I touched upon the land, and obſerved ſome few things, I thought it not impertinent to make mention of them. There was in a Monaſtery in Iſeland, called Helgafiel, a certaine blind Monke who lived miſerably there, he was borne in Groenland, of a darke complexion, and broad face; the Governour commanded him to be brought unto him, that he might know ſome part of the State of Groenland, he ſaid, there was a Monaſtery of St. Thomas in Groenland, into the which, his parents thruſt him when he was but young, and after he was taken out by the Biſhop of Groenland,

                  ay, Pigmies, and Vnicornes, and that the Day did not appeare, untill the Sun had run through Piſces.
               
               This Monke told us marvellous ſtrange things, that there was in the Monaſtery of S. Thomas (where he lived) a Fountaine, which ſent ſorth burning and flaming water, that this water was conveyed through Pipes of ſtone, to the ſeverall Cels of the Monks, and that it made them warme as ſtoves do with us, and all kind of meats might be boyled in this Fountain, and fiery water, &amp; no otherwiſe than if it had bin on a fire indeed, he advertiſed moreover, that the wals of the Monaſtery, were made with Pumice ſtones, out of a certaine mountain not farre from the Monaſtery: like to Hecla in Iſeland, for if you powre this water upon the Pumice ſtone, there will follow a ſlymie matter, which in ſteed of lyme they uſe for motter.
               After the Governors conference with him, I came privately to demand, certaine particulars, touching the Pigmies and other things; he had a little skill in the Latine tongue, he underſtood me ſpeaking Latine, but anſwered me by an Interpreter; he ſaid the Pigmies repreſent the moſt perfect ſhape of man, that they were hayrie to the outermoſt joynts of the finger, and that the males have beards down to the knees, but although they have the ſhape of man, yet they have little ſenſe, or underſtanding, or diſtinct ſpeech, but make ſhew of a kind of

                  He raiſed Groenland, but great ſtore of Ice hung upon the land, this land is Mountainous, with hils like Suger loaves, covered with Snow.
               He coaſted along betwixt W, and N, W. untill he ſaw Diſſolation, which is a great Iland, on the N, W. part of Groenland, here he ſaw great ſtore of Whales, ſome came about and under the ſhip, but did no harme: From hence he directed his courſe N, W. and would have hailed more Northerly if the winde would have ſuffered him, in this courſe he ſee the firſt mountainous Ice; about the laſt of June, he raiſed the land N. off him, he tooke the ſame to be that Iland which Capt. Davis ſet in his Chart, on the W. ſide of this ſtraight he would have gone to N. thereof, but the winde would not ſuffer him, ſo he fell on the Southſide into a great ripling or overfall of a current, into this current, he went and made his way Northward off W. untill he met with Ice which hung on this Iland; wherefore he caſt about to the South, and cleared himſelfe and then ſtood to the W, amongſt ſome ſtore of ſloting Ice, and upon the Ice ſtore of Seales, he ſtill made way N, W. and meetes ſometimes with Ice, and then againe cleare; thus proceeding betwixt Ice and Ice, he ſees a great Iland of Ice overtumble, which was a good warning to him not to come neere them; the next day he had a great ſtorme, and was driven to put in amongſtA warning. the Ice, and there to lye, ſome of his men fell ſicke, he will not ſay for feare, though he ſee no other ſigne of griefe.
               The ſtorme ceaſing, he put from the Ice ſtanding W, S, W: and N, W. and as the cleare Sea and Ice would ſuffer him; ſeeing the ſea thus continued he would ſeeke to the S. but the more he ſtrove the worſe he was, for he was faſt incloſed and began to diſpaire (as he after told this Writer) hee thought he ſhould never have got out of this Ice, but there haue periſhed.
               Wherfore he ſhewed him his Card, that he was 100. leag.See Weymare further than ever any Engliſh man was, and referred to their choyſe to proceed further or no; whereupon ſome wiſht them at home, others any where ſo from amongſt the Ice, but inDiſcontents▪
                   this diſtraction, there paſſed words which was thought upon long time after.
               There was one told the Maſter, that if he had a 100 pound he

would give 90 therof to be at home, but the Carpenter made anſwere and ſaid, if he had 100. he would not give 10 upon any ſuch condition, but would hold it as good money as ever he had any, and by Gods leave, to bring it as well home; well, to worke they goe and with labour get the ſhip cleare, the ſea being alſo cleere, a league or 2 off; the courſe now is N, N, W. in the end, he raiſed high land, at S. W. (covered with ſnow) and names it, Deſire provokes, he heard the noyſe of a great overfall of a tide that came out of the Land, and now he could well diſcerne that formerly he had beene imbayed, and that Time made his acquaintance ſo well knowne to the Ice, that when wet fogge or foule weather came, he ſhould make faſt to the broad peece of Ice, and run and ſport, and fill ſweete freſh water upon the ſame, after he had brought this land to beare S off him, he had a current or tyde to open the Ice, being carried firſt one way and then another, but in bayes they lay as in a pond, without mooving, in the Bay wherein he was thus troubled, he ſee of thoſe Icie mountaines on ground, here was 120 and 140 fathomes of water, and here he ſees a Beare upon the Ice, his men gave chaſe, to him, but loſt him, by the tydes carrying away the Ice, the Beare was gone out of their reach.
               He continued his courſe, towards the North-Weſt, and raiſed land to the North and Ice, where there was a Beare which came from Ice to Ice, untill ſhe came neere them, and then ſhe runne away; hee ſtood along on the South ſide of this land meeting with Ice, which ſeeing, he ſtood into the ſhore, and found a harbour, in the Weſt end of this Iland, he went over one Rock of two fathomes and a halfe, and at low water it was ſo much bare, he names it the Iles of Gods mercy,
                  Iles of Gods Mercy. Partridges. the Maſter ſent this Author, over to diſcover this Iland, to the North and North-Weſt he met with a covery of Partridges, and kild onely the old one, it was barren land, having nothing thereon but water plaſhes, and torne Rockes, as though it had beene ſubiect to earthquakes, to the North of this Iland, there is a great bay or Sea, they know not what itSpring tydes carried the Ice to the N, Weſt. may prove, there was a great Iland of Ice on ground, which with the ſpring tide was ſet on float and carried to the N, W. but came not backe within ſight, here they found ſome drift wood on ſhoare.
               
                  From thence he ſtood to S, W. to double the land to the W. off him, through many peeces of Ice, at length he found a cleare Sea, and raiſed land to the N, W. whereupon he ſtood more to S. then before (and fell amongſt Ice) which he would have doubled to the N. but could not, then he ſtood to the S, W. amongſt the Ice, and ſtrove to get to the land but could not for the Ice, from out of this bay he ſtood to the North, and was ſoone cleare of the Ice, then he ſtood to S. W. and W. where he was incloſed with land and Ice, having land on the one ſide from the S. to the N, W. and on the other ſide he ſee land from E. to W. but the land that lay to the N. and lay E. and W. was but an Iland, he went ſo farre as he could, (and made faſt to the Ice, the tyde brought upon him) but the ebbe did openTide and ebbe. and made way, and 7 or 8 houres he was cleare, and with the great Ilands of Ice, was carried to the N, W.
               He ſtands to the W. along the S. ſhoare and raiſed 3 Capes or headlands one above another, the middlemoſt is an Iland, with a Bay which he thinkes will prove a good harbour, he names them Prince Henries Forland, when he had laid theſe, he raiſed another which was the extreame part of the land looking towards the N. upon it are two hils (but one above the reſt) like an humlocke, he names it King Iames his Cape, to the N. of this lyes certaine Ilands, he names it Queen Annes Forland, he ſtill followed the N. ſhoare beyond the Kings Forland, there is a Bay wherein lyeth ſome broken land and cloſe to the maine, but he paſſed by on the night.
               From thence he ſtood to the N. and W. to double this land againe, and fell with land that ſtretched from the maine, like a ſhoare from S, to N. and from N, to W. and downe to S, again, here a ſtorme takes him and he ſtands to N. and raiſes land, then he ſtood to S. againe, for he was loathat any time to ſee the N. ſhoare, the ſtorme continuing, and he comming to the S. he found himſelfe ſhot to the W. a great way, which he mervailed at, (conſidering his leaward way) to S. W. ward off this land, there is a hill he named Mount Charles, to the N. and beyond this is an Iland, that to the Eaſt hath a fore head land, and beyond it to the W. other broken land, where he thinks may be found a good harbour, he names this Cape Salisbury.
               
               He then left thoſe lands to the North-Eaſt, and fell into a ripline or overfall of a current, which he thought to be ſhoald

water, but had no ground, he put on ſtill in ſight of the Southland, and raiſed land 2 leag. from the maine, he tooke it to be the North maine, but it proved an Iland, having a very faire Head-land to the Weſt, which he named Cape Digges,
                  Cape Digges.
                   on the other ſide, to the Eaſt, was another Cape or head-land which he called Cape Worſtenholme; betwixt which two heCape Worſtenholme.

               Thus going from place to place, they ſee (to the Weſt) a Hill higher then all the reſt, it was ſteepe, and they could not get vp to it, but on the South-weſt ſide; and on that ſide was a great water pond, from whence on the South runneth a ſtreame of water, as much as would drive a Mill, falling into the Sea: and in this place bred great ſtore of Fowle, and the beſt graſſe grew there, they had ſeene ſince their comming from England, they found Sorrell and Scurvey-graſſe in great aboundance, they found likewiſe Hills, made like to haycockes,Fowle hanged. within which were great ſtore of Fowle hanged by the neckes, they tooke many of them; and downe a valley carried them to their Boate.
               In this time the Maſter had brought in the Ship, betweene the two lands, &amp; ſhot off ſome peeces, to call the boat on board, for it was a fogge, they perſwaded him to ſtay heere for refreſhing, but he would not, but ſailed downe to the S. the land beares E, from him, and the ſame Maine that he had allHe loſt ſight of Eaſt-land. the time followed, he looſeth the ſight thereof, becauſe it fell away to the Eaſt, and after he had ſailed 25 or 30. leag. he came to ſhallow water, broken ground, and Rockes; which he paſſed to the S. and in a ſtorme of winde, the water ſtill ſhoalding, he came to anchor in 15 fathomes.
               After this, he wayed and ſtood S, E. for ſo the Land laid, and came to have land on both ſides, then he anchored, and ſent the Boate on land, the Land on the W. was a very narrowA large Sea to South. point, and to the S. there was a large Sea: He ſtood to the South betweene theſe two Lands in this place, not above

two leagues, and in the ſight of the Eaſt-ſhore; in the end he loſt ſight thereof, and came into the bottome of a bay into 6. or 7. fathom water, then he ſtands vp againe to the N. by the Weſt-ſhore, vntill he came to an Iland in 53 deg. where he tooke in water, and ballaſt.
               From thence, he paſſed to the N. but ſome 2 or 3 dayes after, there fell ſome reaſoning concerning their comming into this Bay and going out, the Maſter takes occaſion to reviue old matters, and diſplaces his Mate Robert Ivet, and alſo his Boate-ſwaine, for words ſpoken in the great Bay of Ice; he places Robert Bylot his Mate, and William Wilſon Boate-ſwaine, and then ſtands vp to the N, vntill he raiſed land, and then downe to the S. then vp againe to the N. and then downe to

               He anchored in 6 or 7 fadomes, and lay there 8 dayes, before which time he could not have one houre to get vp his anchor, the winde then ceaſing, the Maſter would have vp the anchor, againſt the mind of all that knew what belonged therevnto; but when he had his anchor on peake, the Ship tooke one ſea and threw them all from Capſtone, and diuers were hurt, he left his anchor and ſaved moſt of his Cable, for the Carpenter had laid his axe ready to cut the Cable if occaſion ſhould ſo fall out.
               From hence he ſtands to S, W. through a cleare Sea of divers ſoundings, and came to a Sea of two coulours, one blacke the other white, and 16 or 17 fadom water, betweene which he went 5 or 6 leag. the night comming on, he goes in his maine and fore-ſaile and came into 5 or 6 fathomes, he ſaw no land for it was darke, ſo that he ſtood to the Eaſt, and hadThe Weſt moſt of Hadſons Bayes. deeper water, and then ſtood to the S. and S.

               He was victualled for 6 moneths with good proviſion and might have had more from home if he would, now hee muſt pinch for that he knew of no ſupply untill he came the next yeere to Cape Digs, where the Fowle breed, for there was all his hopes; wherefore hee propounded reward to him that either killed beaſt, fiſh, or fowle; his Gunner dyed about the middle of this moneth, he blameth the Maſters uncharitable dealing with this man, but note what followed.
               The Maſter kept in his houſe at London, a young man named
                     Henry Greenes condition. 
                  Henry Greene, borne in Kent, of worthy Parents, but by his life and converſation, he had loſt the love of all his friends, &amp; ſpent all that he had, but by the means of one Maſter Venſon, his mother parted with 4 l. to buy him cloathes, which money he was not truſted with the diſpoſing of himſelfe, this Henry Greene, was not knowne to the Adventurers, nor had any wages, but came onely on board at Graves-end, and at Harwich, would have gone into the field with one Wilkinſon of our Company; at Iſland he fell out with the Chirurgion in Dutch,
                  
                     Green beats the Surgion. and he beat him on ſhore in Engliſh, which ſet all the Company in a rage, ſo that they had much adoe to get the Chirurgion on board againe, this Author told the Maſter of it, but he bade him let the matter alone; for (ſaid he) the Chirurgion hath a tongue that would wrong the beſt friend he had, but Robert Iuet, the Maſters Mate would needs put his fingers

in the Embers, and told the Carpenter a long tale, (when he was drunke) that the Maſter had brought in Greene to cracke his credit that ſhould diſpleaſe him, which when the Maſter heard of, (being forty leagues from Iſland) he would have gone backe to Iſland to have ſent Juet his Mate home in a Fiſherman, but being otherwiſe perſwaded, all was well and Greene ſtood upright, and was very inward with the Maſter, and was a ſerviceable man every way for manhood, but for Religion he would ſay he was white Paper, whereon he might write what he would; now the Gunner was dead, and then (as order is in ſuch caſes) if the Company ſtand in neede of any thing belonged to the man that is deceaſſed, then is it brought to the maine Maſt, and there ſold to them that will give the moſt for it; this Gunner, had a gray cloth Gowne, which Greene prayed the Maſter to befriend him, ſo much as to let him have it, paying for it as another would give, the Maſter ſaid he ſhould, and therefore anſwered ſome, who ſought for it that Greene ſhould have it and none elſe.
               Now out of time and ſeaſon, the Maſter called the Carpenter to goe in hand with a houſe on ſhore, which at the beginning hee would not heare of, when it might have beene done; the Carpenter told him that the Snow and Froſt was ſuch, as hee neither could nor would goe in hand with ſuch worke, which when he heard he feretted him out of his cabbine and ſtruck him, calling him by many foule words and threatned to hang him, the Carpenter tolde him, that he knew what belonged to his place better then he did, and that he was no houſe Carpenter, yet the houſe was made with much labour to no end, the next day after, the Maſter and the Carpenter fell out, the Carpenter tooke his Peece and Henry Greene with him, for it was ordered that none ſhould goe out alone, but one with a Peece another with a Pike, this did move the Maſter ſo much more againſt Greene, that Robert Bylot his mate muſt have the Gowne, and had it delivered unto him, which Henry Greene ſeeing, he charged the Mr. with his promiſe, but the Mr. did ſo raile on Greene, &amp; with ſo many words of diſgrace, telling him that all his friends durſt not truſt him with 20 ſhillings, &amp; therfore why ſhould he, and as for wages he was to have none, nor ſhould if he did not pleaſe him, yet

the Mr. had promiſed him as good wages as any man in the ſhip, and to have him one of the Princes Guard at his home cō
                  ming, but you ſhall ſee how the Divell ſo wrought out of this that Greene did the Maſter what miſchiefe he could, in ſeeking
                     Greene practiſe of miſcheif. to diſcredit him, and to thruſt him and other honeſt men out of the ſhip; to ſpeake of all the troubles, and of this cold Winter would be too tedious.
               Now he ſheweth how mercifully God dealt with them in this time, for in the ſpace of three moneths he had ſuch ſtore of one kinde of Fowle, which were Partridge, as white as Milke, at which he killed at leaſt one hundred dozen, of ſundry ſorts, for all was fiſh that came to the net, at the Spring this fowle left them, and in their places came other of divers ſorts, as Swannes, Gooſe, Ducke, and Teale, but hard to come by, he thought that they would have bred there in thoſe broken grounds, but they doe not, but came from the S, and flew to the N. further then he was this Voyage, yet if they had beene taken ſhort with N. or N. E. winds, they ſtay there againſt the winds returne, and then take their flight to the N. ward, and in ſhort time none of them are to be ſeene there.
               Then he ſearched the wooddy hils and vallies, for all thingsMiſerable food. that had any ſhow of ſubſtance (for food) how vile ſoever, the moſſe of the ground, and the frog in his ingendring time was not ſpared, but amongſt divers ſorts of buds, it pleaſed God that Thomas Woodhouſe brought one of a tree, that was full of Turpentine ſubſtance, of this the Surgion made a decoctionA Medecinable bud. to drinke, and applyed the buds hot to them that were troubled with ache in any part, from whence they received preſent eaſe.
               Now about that time the Ice began to breake out of theA Salvage▪
                   bayes, there came a Salvage to their Ship, as it were to ſee and to be ſeene, and was the firſt, that they had ſeen in all that time, he intreats him well, and uſed him kindly, promiſing to himſelfe great matters by this meanes; and therefore called for all the Knives and hatchets which every man had to his private vſe, and to this Salvage he gave a knife, a looking-glaſſe, and buttons, who received them thankefully, and made ſignes that after he had ſlept he would come againe, which he did and brought with him a ſled which he drew after him, and upon it two Deere skins, and two Beaver skinnes, he had a ſcrip

under his arme, out of which he drew thoſe things the Maſter had given him; and layes the knife upon the Beaver skinnes, and the glaſſes and buttons upon the other, and ſo gave them to the Maſter, who received them; and the Salvage tookeThey trade. thoſe things which the Maſter had given him, and put them into his ſcrip againe, then the Maſter ſhowed him a hatchet, for which he would have given him one of his Deere skins, but the Maſter would have both, and ſo he had, although not willingly, after many ſignes of people to the N. and to the S. and that after ſo many ſleepes, he would come again, he went his way but came no more.
               Now the Ice being broke out of the Sounds, that a boate might paſſe, the Mr. appointed William Wilſon, Henry Greene, Michael Peirce, John Thomas, Andrew Motter, Bennet Mathewes, and Arnold Lodlo, to go on fiſhing, theſe men the firſt day they went, caught 500. fiſh as bigge as good Herrings, and ſome Trouts, here was good hope to have their wantFiſhing. ſupplyed, but thoſe were the moſt that ever they got in one day, for many dayes they got not a quarter ſo many; in this time of their fiſhing, Henry Greene, and William Wilſon, with ſome others plotted to take the net &amp; Shallop which the Carpenter had new ſet up, and ſo to ſhift for themſelves, but the Shallop being ready, the Maſter would goe in it himſelfe, to the S, and S, W, to ſee if he could meete with people, for to that end it was ſet up: and that way he could ſee the woods ſet on fier by them; the Maſter takes the net and ſhallop, and ſo much victuals as would ſerve for nine dayes, and went to the Southward, they that remained on board were appointed to take in water, wood, and ballaſt; and to make the ſhip ready againſt his returne; but he could ſet no time, for hee was perſwaded that if he met with the Salvages, hee ſhould have refreſhing of freſh meat, and that good ſtore; but in concluſion, he returned worſe then he went, and though the Inhabitants ſet the woods on fire before him, yet they would not come to him.
               Being now returned, he makes ready for his home cōming,A bill of returne. and firſt he delivers all the bread in the fore roome, wch came to a pound a peece for every mans ſhare, and delivered unto every man a bill of returne, willing them to have that to ſhew if it pleaſed God they came home, and he wept, when he gave

it unto them, but to help themſelves to ſome reliefe; the boat went to fiſh from Friday morning untill Sunday noone, and brought but 80 ſmall fiſh for 18 hungry bellies; whereupon he waighed and came away from his wintering place into the Sea, where his bread being gone, that ſtore of cheeſe which he had muſt ſtop the gap, being but five; the Company grudged,Cheeſe ſhifted. for they made account of nine; but thoſe five were equally divided by the Maſter, ſome counſelling him to the contrary, for there were ſome, who having it, would make haſte to be rid thereof, becauſe they could not gouerne it; I know (ſaith the writer) when Henry Greene gave halfe his bread which he had for 14 dayes, to one to keepe, and prayed him not to let him have any untill the next Munday, but before Wedneſday at night, he never left untill he had it againe, having eaten up his firſt weeks bread before; ſo Wilſon the boatſwaine, had eat in one day his 14 dayes bread, and hath laid in bed, 2 or 3 dayes for his labour. The cauſe why the Maſter delivered all the cheeſe, was becauſe they were not all of one goodneſſe, and therefore they ſhould ſee that they had no wrong done them, but that every man had the beſt and worſt together, which was 3 pound and one halfe for 7 dayes.
               The wind ſerving, he wayed and ſtands to the N, W. and on Munday night, the 18 of June, he fell into the Ice, and the next day with W. wind he lay faſt within ſight of land untill Sunday following; now being here the Maſter told Nicholas Simmes that there would be a breaking up of Cheſts, and a ſearch for bread, and willed him, if he had any to bring it to him, which he did, and delivered the Maſter 30 Cakes in a bag; this deed of the Mr. (if it be true) hath made me marvell what ſhould be the reaſon, why hee did not ſtop the breach in the beginning, but let it grow to that height as it overthrew himſelfe and many other honeſt men; but there are many devices in the heart of man, but the counſell of the Lord ſhould ſtand.
               
               Being thus on the Ice, on Saturday the one and twentieth

               Away goes Greene in a rage, ſwearing to cut his throat that went about to diſturbe them, and left Wilſon by him, with whom he had ſome conference, but to no good, for hee was perſwaded to goe on with the action, whilſt it was hot, leſt their parties ſhould faile them; and the miſchiefe they intended to others, ſhould fall upon their owne ſhoulders. Greene comes againe and demaunded what he ſaid; Wilſon anſwered and ſaid, he is in his old ſong, ſtill patient; then he ſpake to Greene to ſtay 3 dayes, in which time hee would ſo deale with the Mr. as all ſhould bee well, but being denied, he dealt with him but for 2 dayes, nay, for 12 houres, there is no way then ſay they, but out of hand: then he told them that if they would ſtay while Munday▪ he would joine with them to ſhare all the victuals in the ſhip▪ and would juſtifie it when he came at home; but this would not ſerve, wherefore he told them it was ſome worſe matter they had in hand, then they made ſhew of, and that it was blood and revenge he ſought or elſe he would not undertake ſuch a deed, at ſuch a time of night, Greene with that tooke his Bible, which lay before him, andSweare. ſware that he would doe no harme, and what he did, it was for the good of the Voyage, and for nothing elſe, and that all the reſt ſhould doe the like, the like did Wilſon ſweare.
               
                  
                  Greene went his way, and preſently comes Ivett, who becauſe hee was an ancient man, he hoped to have found ſome reaſon in him, but he was worſe then Greene, for hee ſwore plainely that he would juſtifie this deed at home-comming, after him came, Iohn Thomas, and Michael Pierce, as birds of one feather, but becauſe they died, as hereafter ſhall be ſhewed, he let them paſſe; then came Motter and Bennet, of whom he demaunded, if they were well adviſed what they had taken in hand, they anſwered, they were, and therefore came to take their oath.
               Now ſaith this writer, becauſe he was much condemned for this oath, as one that plotted with them, and that by an oath he ſhould binde them together to performe what they had begun; he thought good to ſet downe to the view of all men, to ſee how well their oath and deeds agreed, and thus it was; You ſhall be true to God, your Prince and Countrey, you ſhall doe nothing but to the glory of God, and to the good of the action in hand, and harme to no man. This was the oath without adding or diminiſhing, he looked for moe of thoſe companions, althoughthoſe were too many, but there came no more while it was darke, and they in readineſſe to put this deed of darkeneſſe into execution, he called to him Greene and Wilſon, and prayed them not to goe in hand with it in the darke, but to ſtay untill morning, for now he hoped every man would goe to his reſt, but wickedneſſe ſleepeth not: for Henry Greene keepeth the Maſter Company all night, and gave this writer bread, which his Cabbin mate gave him, and others were as watchfull as hee; then he asked Henry Greene, whom he would put out with the Maſter, he ſaid the Carpenter, Iohn King, and the ſick men, he ſaid they ſhould not doe well to part with the Carpenter, what need ſoever they ſhould have; why, the Carpenter was in no more regard amongſt them, then another, for that he and John King were condemned for wrong done in the victuals; but the chiefeſt cauſe was becauſe the Maſter loved him, and made him his mate, upon this his returne from his wintring place, thereby diſplacing Robert Bylot, who they did grudge becauſe hee could neither write nor reade; for therefore ſaid they, the Maſter and his ignorant mate will carry the ſhip whether the Maſter pleaſeth; the Maſter having forbidden any man to keepe account or reckoning

having taken from all men whatſoever ſerved for that purpoſe; well, he obtained of Henry Greene and Wilſon, that the Carpenter ſhould ſtay, by which meanes, after that they had ſatisfied themſelves, the Maſter and the reſt might bee taken into the ſhip againe, or hee hoped that ſome one or other would give ſome notice to the Carpenter, Iohn King, or the Maſter; for ſo it might have come to paſſe, and have beene by ſome of them prevented, that were the moſt forward.
               Now it cannot be amiſſe to ſhew how they were lodged, and to begin in the cookes Roome, there lay Bennet, and the Cooper lame without the Cookes roome, on the ſtarboard ſide lay Thomas Woodhouſe ſicke, next to him lay Sydrach Fenner lame, then lay Wilſon the boatſwaine, and then Arnold Lodlo next to him, in the Gunners roome lay Robert Iuet and John Thomas, on the Larboard ſide lay Michaell But, and Adiran Moore which was never well ſince they loſt their anckor, next to him lay Michaell Peirce and Andrew Motter, next to them, without the Gunner roome lay Iohn King, and with him Robert Bilot, next to them himſelfe, and next to him Francis Clements, In the midſhip betwixt the Capſtone and the Pompes, Henry Greene, and Nicholas Simmes, this night John King was late up, and they thought he had beene with the Mr. but he was with the Carpenter, who lay in the poope, and comming from him was met by his cabbine mate, as it were by chance, ſo they went to cabbine together, it was not long ere it was day, then came Bennet, for water for the kettle, he went into the hold, when he was in, they ſhut the hatch on him, but who kept it downe he knoweth not, but upon the decke came Bennet.

the Maſter called to the Carpenter, and tolde him that he was bound, but he heard no anſwer made, now Arnold Lodlo, and Michell But, railed at them and told them there knavery would ſhow it ſelfe, then was the Shallop hailed up to the ſhip ſide, and the poore ſicke and lame men, were called up to get them into the Shallop, the Maſter called to this writer who came out of his cabbine, as well as he could, to the hatch way to ſpeake with him, where on his knees he beſought them for the love of God to remember themſelves, and to do as they would be done unto, they bad him keep himſelfe well and get him into his cabbine, not ſuffering the Maſter to ſpeak to him; but when he came into his cabbin againe, at the horn window which gave light into his cabbine, the Mr. told him that Juet would overthrow them all; nay ſaid he, it is that villaine Greene, and ſpake it not ſoftly.
               Now was the Carpenter at liberty, and asked them if they would be hanged when they came at home, and as for himſelfe, he ſaid he would not ſtay in the Ship unleſſe they would force him, they bid him go then, for they would not ſtay him, I will ſaid he, ſo I may have my cheſt and all that is in it, they ſaid he ſhould, and preſently put it into the Shallop, then came he to take his leave of this writer, who perſwaded him to ſtay, which if he would he might ſo worke that all might be well, but he anſwered, that he did not thinke but that they would be glad to take them in againe, for he was ſo perſwaded by the Maſter, that there was not one in all the ſhip that could tell how to carry her home, but ſaith he, if we muſt part (which we will not willingly doe, for they would follow the ſhip) prayed him if they came to the Cape before them, that he would leave ſome token, that he had beene there neare to the place where the Fowles breed, and he would doe the like for us, and ſo with teares we parted, now were the ſick men driven out of their cabbines into the Shallop but Iohn Thomas, who was Francis Clements friend, and Bennet, was the Coopers, ſo as there was words betweene them and Henry Greene, ſaying that they ſhould goe, and the other ſwearing that they ſhould not goe, but ſuch as were in the Shallop ſhould returne when Henry Greene heard that, he was compelled to give place and to put out Arnold Lodl

                     Greene ſlaine. and Michael Pierce received many wounds, and ſo did the reſt. Michael Pierce cleareth the Boat and put it from the ſhore, and helpeth Andrew Motter in: but in the clearing of the Boat Pricket received a cruel wound on his back with an Arrow. Michael Pierce and Motter rowed away the Boat; which when the Salvages ſawe, they came to their Boats; which they feared they would have lanched to have followed

them, but they did not; their Ship was in the middle of the Channell, and yet could not ſee them all this time.
               Now when they had rowed a good way from the ſhore Pierce fainted, and could rowe no more: then was Motter driven to ſtand in the Boats head and wave to the Ship, which at firſt ſawe them not; and when they did, they could not tell what to make of them, but in they ſtood for them, and ſo tooke them up. Greene was throwne into the Sea, the reſt was taken into the Ship, the Salvage being yet alive, but without ſence. That day dyed Wilſon curſing and ſwearing in moſt fearefull manner, Michael Pierce lived two dayes and thenThe end of 4. wicked men. dyed. Thus have you had the tragicall end of Greene and his 3. Mates, being the luſtieſt men in all the Ship.
               The poore number that was left was to ply the Ship to and againe in the mouth of the Straits, for there was no anchoring; and beſides, they were to goe in the Boat to kill Fowle to bring them home, which they did with great danger; for if the winde blew, there was an high Sea: and the Eddie of the tide would carry the Ship ſo neere the Rocks, as it feared the Maſter, for ſo now they call By lot.
               After which great labour, and on the South Cape they had killed 300. Fowle, they ſtood to the Eaſt: but the wind cameThree hund

               They lie a trye all night, and the next day the fogge continues, they ſeeke for ground to anchor in, but found none under 100. Fathoms. The next day he weighed againe and ſtood to the Eaſt, and now they are brought to the allowance of halfe a Fowle a day, yet they had ſome meatleft, and nothing elſe; and now were glad to burne of the feathers (for ſowing

of the skins, which before they ſleaed off the Fowle) becauſe they will not pull, nor the garbidge alſo was not throwne away.
               He ſaith that after they were cleare of thoſe Ilands which lie out with two points, one on the South Eaſt, and the other on the North, making a Bay to the ſight, as if there were no way through, hee continued his courſe Eaſt South Eaſt, and South Eaſt, thinking to raiſe deſolations, from thence to ſhape his courſe from Ireland, though Ivet perſwaded to goe for New-found-land, hoping there to have reliefe amongſt our Countrymen: but in Latitude 57. degrees, the winde came South Weſt, and ſo it was thought fit to ſeek for food where ſome grew: viz Ireland, and ſo the courſe was directed; In which time they were fain to frie their Fowles bones in CandleFowles Bones fryed for meate. tallow, putting vinegar thereto which was ſtirred amongſt them, and every man had one pound of Candles allowed for one weeke as a great dainty. And when Rob. Juet ſaid that by his reckning they were within 60. or 70. leagues of Ireland, they had 200. leagues thither, their courſe was much longer, (though evil ſtony) for their men were ſo weake as they were faine to ſit at the Helme.
               Then Robert Juet dyed, and the reſt deſpaired, and ſaid they were paſt Ireland; their laſt Fowle was in Stepetub, and the men cared not what end went firſt. The Maſter was glad to doe their labour and his owne, tackling going to wrack, and none regarding to helpe the ſame. In this extremity it pleaſed God to give them ſight of Land; not farre from the place where the Maſter ſaid they ſhould fall, which was the Bay of Galloway to the Weſt of the Derſes; ſo they ſtood along to the South W. and eſpied a ſaile which was a Boat off Foye at anchor fiſhing; this Barke brought them into BeareBeare Haven in Ireland.
                   Haven; here they ſtayed ſome few dayes and dealt with the Iriſh for Reliefe, but found none: for in that place there was neither bread, drink, nor money, or Country men which were then on fiſhing, they found as could in kindnſſe, that they would doe nothing without preſent money. In the end John Waymouth one of the Barke brought them in and furniſhed them with money upon pawne of their beſt Anchor and Cable, wherewith they brought Bread, Beare, and Beefe.
               
                  Now as they were beholding to Waymouth, ſo were they beholding to Captaine Tayler for making their Contracts, and for their mens wages, who would not goe with them home, except Waymouth would paſſe his word; Whereupon Taylor ſwore he would preſſe them; and if they would not goe he would hang them.
               In concluſion, they agreed for 3. pound 10. ſhillings a man to bring the Ship to Plimouth or Phalmouth, and to give the Pilot 5. pound; and if they were put into Briſtow, they were to have 4. li. 10. s. a Man, and the Pilot 6. li. and omitting further circumſtance, they came to Plimouth, from thence toArive at Plimouth.

                  e of ſome of the company; it having beene the requeſt of Robert Iuet, that the Maſter ſhould redreſſe ſome abuſes and ſlaunders as he called them, againſt this Iuet, which thing after the Maſter had examined, and heard with equitie what hee could ſay for himſelfe, there were proved ſo many great abuſes and mutinous matters againſt the Maſter, and action by Ivet, that there was danger to have ſuffered them longer: and it was fit time to puniſh and cut off further occaſions of the like motives.
               It was firſt proved to his face by Bennet Mathew, our Trumpeter,
                     Inets mutinies. upon our firſt ſight of Island: and hee confeſt that hee ſuppoſ'd that in the account would bee man-ſlaughter, and prove bloody to ſome.
               Secondly, at our comming from Island, in the hearing of the company, hee did threaten to turne the Ship head home, from the action, which at that time was wiſely pacefied by the Maſter, in hope of amendment.
               Thirdly, it was depoſed by Phillip Staffe our Capenter, and Arnold Lodlo to his face upon the holy Bible, that he perſwaded them to keepe Muskets charged, and Swords ready in their Cabbines, for they ſhould be charged with ſhot ere the voyage were over.
               Fourthly, we being peſtered in the Ice, he had uſed many words tending to mutinie, diſcouragement, and ſlaunder of the action, which eaſily tooke effect in thoſe that were timerous: And had not the Maſter in time prevented, it might

eaſily have overthrowne the voiage, and now lately being imbayed in a deepe Bay, which the Maſter had deſire to ſee, for ſome reaſons to himſelfe knowne, his words tended altogether to put the company into a fright of extremity, by ventring in cold, jeſting at our Maſters hope to ſee Bancum by Candlemas.
               For thoſe and divers other baſe ſlaunders againſt the Maſter,Ivet diſplac'd. he was depoſed, and Robert Bylot who had ſhewed himſelfe honeſtly, reſpecting the good of the voyage, was placed Maſters Mate in his ſtead.
               Alſo, Francis Clements the Boateſwaine, at that time was put from his office, and William Wilſon a man thought more fit preferred to his place: this man had▪ baſely carried himſelfe to our. Maſter, and to the action.

               Alſo, the Maſter promiſed, that if the offenders yet behaved themſelves honeſtly, he would be a meanes for their good and that hee would forget injuries, with other admonitions.

               The Voyage of Sir Thomas Button with two ſhips, the Reſolution,
                  Auguſt. the Admirall, the Diſcovery Vice-admirall, manured and victualled for 18. Moneths. 1612.
               COncerning this voyage there cannot bee much expected from me, ſeing that I have met with none of the Iournalls thereof: It appeareth that they have beene concealed, for

what reaſons I know not, but it is ſitting that ſuch things ſhould be made extant, as may any way redound to the good of the Common-wealth; and therefore I can but communicate what I have received from Abacuck Pricket, and others by Relation, who was in the ſame Voyage, and from Sir Thout as Roe in the laſt part of a Iournall of this voyage.
               He departed about the beginning of May, and went by the Weſt, and entered the paſſage on the South of Reſolution, and ſometime was faſt amongſt the Ice: but at length he came to Diggs his Iland, where hee ſtaied 8. dayes; and in that timeI

                   ſet up a Pinnace he had brought from home with him in pieces; and they ſet from thence to the Weſtward, where hee diſcovered the Land he called Carys Swanſneſt; From thence he proceeded to the Southward of the Weſt, falling with land in Latitude about 60. d. 40. with the named Hopes-check. I thinke becauſe that there his expectation was croſſed, and thereabout enduring a grievous ſtorme, was put to the Southward, and conſtrained to looke for harbour the 13. of Auguſt, to repaire ſome loſſes. After which time came on the new Winter with much ſtormie weather, as he was conſtrained to winter there, in a ſmall Rile or Creeke on the North ſide of a River in Lat. 57. d. 10. which River he named Port Nelſon,
                  Port Nelſon.
                   after the name of his Maſter (whom he buried there) putting his ſmal Ship in the foremoſt and Baracadoe both them (with Piles of Firre and earth) from ſtorme of Snow, Ice, Raine, Floods, or what elſe might fall.
               He wintered in his Ship, and kept 3. ſires all the Winter: but loſt many men, and yet was ſupplied with great ſtore of white Partridges, and other Fowle, of which I have heard it credibly reported, that this company killed 1800. dozen in the Winter ſeaſon.

               S'eing the South ſhore within Fretum Hudſon, neere Hopes advance twice or thrice, and once trying the tide about Savvage Iles, where it came from the South Eaſt, &amp; flowed 3. fathoms. At length he came in the South Channell betweene3. Fathoms. the Ile Salisbury, and the South maine ſayling in between C. Woſtenholme and Sir Drdley Diggs his Ile, to the Weſt end

thereof, where he ſaith is a banke of Owes to anchor upon at 13. fathom. C. Woſtenholme is to be brought within the Weſt point of the Ile, which will then beare Eaſt by South. Here the Salvages did offer to aſſault his men (bound going to killA Fovvle. Willicks, of which there is ſuch ſtore, as in ſhort time hee could have laded his Boat) with two Canons, and to the number80 Salvages in 2. Canons. of 70. or 80. men came upon them, untill with one Musket ſhot he ſlew one of their men, and hurt more, who much amazed with the report and excecution of a Musket retired, yet at his comming from thence, he ſending his Pinnace boat on land to take in freſh water; the Salvages were laid in ambuſh amongſt the Rocks, and ſlew him 5. men dead, one eſcaped5. men ſlaine by ſwimming. It is much to bee doubted that the Salvages did ſlay thoſe men in revenge, for 4. of their great Canons he tooke off the Land from this people, whereof he reſtored but two backe againe. And here it was where the villaines Greene and Juct were ſlaine, after they had expoſed Maſter Hudſon; This is Sir Dudley Diggs his Ile, and there is Deare within the ſame. Hee paſſed from hence to a Cape on the N. ſide of his Bayes entrance, which he named Carys Swans neſt, and from thence to his Hopes checkt, was troubled with ſhift of winds, and ſhould water, took harbour the 15. of Auguſt in Port Nelſon, he endured a ſharpe Winter loſt many men, kild 3. Deare in the River as they were ſwimming for ſide to ſide. There came alſo to them divers Beares and Wolfes, and it was the 16. of February before the River Not above a mile broad. was froze over, having had divers warme thawing dayes before, the Captain having beene ſick the whole Winter, began to mend the 24. of Ianuary. The Ice began not to cleare out of the River until the 21. of Aprill, after which they killed daily with their Net abundance of Fiſh, as bigge as Mackrils.
               Now during this wintering it appeareth, that Sir Thomas having good time to adviſe and contemplate what was to be done the nextyeere; drew ſome Demands in writing, whichSomething propounded to the company. he cauſed (it ſeemed) the moſt underſtanding men of his Company to anſwer. Of which, ſuch anſwers as came to my hands I doe hereby freely impart, for thy better underſtanding.

               What I received from Sir Thomas Roe, was an Abſtract copy taken out of Sir Thomas Buttons owne Iournall, being at his returne to this Hopes Checkt, and not before: As from the beginning of his Voyage, or his wintring. I have nothing but by report, and thus he proceeded from thence.
               15. This day being there he plyed up with contrary winds, and fogg having diverſity of depth, altogether ſtanding Eaſtwards of ſometimes to 30. Faddome and more, and ſtanding in to 7. or 6 m. thus travercing and anckoring, untill the 23. day, finding the Tyde to come from N. E. by N. which is an eſpeciall argument that the land doth lye ſo, and not any thing elſe of note.
               23 Having thus plyed up to the N. E. wards untill this day, and ſtanding into the ſhore, hee anckored for to try the tyde, thinking to ſend his Boate on Land, to ſee what Land it ſhould be: it bare on him from the N. E. by N. to the N. W. by N. and the depth 42. Fadome not above 4. ½. League from the Land, this was the higheſt land hee had ſeene, ſince hee came from Sir Dudley Diggs his Iland, the laſt yeare this Land he named Hopes Advance.
               
               24. This morning proved thick eaſie winde, and it fell to lighten and thunder, ſo as hee held it not fit to adventure the Boat from the Ship.
               25. He ſtood of from midnight until this day 10. leagues N. E. by N. to anchor: but he ſaith the winde was N. E. by N. the ground was more even in ſtanding off, and on then before, he ſtood off 4. leagues more into 87. Fathom.
               This evening at the Sunnes ſetting, he took him with two ſeverall Inſtruments, and found him to goe downe 33. d. to

the W. off North by one, and by the other 30. d. they tooke the middeſt betwixt both.
               26 After midnight he ſtood in againe N. N. W. 5. leagues, the wind came to the S. W. the weather faire and cleare, and the beſt he had ſince he came from his wintering place: about 9. this morning he ſees land; it bore on him from the N. E. by North, to the N. W. by North, about 8. or 9. leagues off at noone hee ſteered to the Eaſterne point, to get hold thereof, and had a good obſervation in 62. d. 42. m. and his depth 74. fathoms; who will protract this Voyage to try whether this ut ultra proved a Bay or no, muſt begin here, and proceed to Carys Swans neſt.
               From this noone untill midnight he ſtood N. E. by N. 18. leagues with much winde and goowne Sea.
               From midninght being in 15. fathoms: the weather hazy, the winde S. W. he ſtood off N. E. by North 12. leagues, till noone; ſeeing the weather like to be bad, and at 3. in the morning; he found his depth not anſwerable to his expectation, for he had but 25. fathom, and at 
                     •
                  . paſt 3. 21. fathom; hee ſtood S. E. till 4. that morning, and had 30. fathom.
               27. About 6. this morning hee gave order to take in his Skiffe; the weather clearing, he ſaw land N. and by E. about 5. leagues off, and was as the other land that hee laſt ſawe ſomething higher; and having edged in with the land, from this morning 6. untill noone, the land was N. E. and by E. from him.
               From noone untill 6. in the evening, he ſteered E. one point without the land 4. leagues; at 6. he anchored 32. fathom. It was then ſlake water; for at 8. came a ſtrong ſet from N. by E. at 11, the winde S. S. W. and blew much, hee weighed and ſtood away N. E. with his Fore and Miſion Sayles.
               28 At midnight he put out all ſayles and ſtood N. E. away 4. leagues, untill morning 4, having depth then 73. fathom, he edged in N. and N. and by E. upon that tyre, hee found the night before, and runne from this morning 4. untill noone, 6. leagues N ſomewhat Eaſterly.
               This noone with bould winde S. he looſt up for the ſhoreNot certayne whether flood or ebbe at this time. to get an oppertunity, if poſſibly, to ſend his Boat on land to have found which had beene the flood, and which the ebbe: but when he came within 2. leagues of ſhore, hee found the Bay all broken ground, and the Sea full of breaches a good

way off the ſhore, and ſome within one mile under his Lee.
               The weather growing ſuddenly very thick, he came to an anchor at one a clock in the afternoone, and ſent the Boat on Land: but they had not beene from him halfe a Glaſſe, but it grew ſo thick, that he cauſed Muskets to bee ſhot to call the Boat back againe, at the end of 5. Glaſſes they returned, ſaying, that having rode halfe an houre at anchor, they could diſcerne no tyde, no more could he in the Ship. In this place it is a Bay full of ſmall Iles neere the ſhore under the high land; and as he rode bore on him N. N. E. Eaſterly, and S. W. at clock 4. the winde began to blow very much; hee wayedBegan here to protract and finde whether it bee a Bay or me
                        •
                     
                   and ſtands E. N. E. of with a S. S. W. winde untill 6. that night the winde encreaſing to a great ſtorme, he takes in his maine and top ſayles, and ſtands away E. N. E. with a foreſayle, at 8. a clock he had 63. fathom, and ſo ſtanding one houre longer, it began to ſhoald contrary to expectation, he came into 50. fathom for that to fore running Eaſtward, hee alwaies depened his water, which now ſhoalding he edged of E. till midnight, &amp; they had but 44. fathom, which perceiving, he found that he was imbayed, therefore to prevent further danger, he ſtrook ſayle and lay to Halle.
               29. From midnight untill 3. this morning, he lay on Hull, having the water ſo ſhoald, and at 3. the weather clearing a little with the increaſe of the daylight, hee ſaw land from the E. by S. to the N. N. E. Eaſterly, which perceiving, hee ſet his Sayles, and flats about his Ship head, and ſtood W. of till noone, 4. Leagues.
               Thus at noone it falling calme and hazie, he anckors with his ledge Anckor, hee feared all the coaſt along to bee rockie ground, and being thus at anckor at 23. Fadome, he had at 2. a Clock a little cleare, and ſaw the Land not paſtt 2. Leagues from him, from the N. to the W. S. W. which together with the Land which he ſaw in the morning, from S. to the E. by S. N. E. Eaſterly, gave him aſſurance, that he was imbayed, for that he could not be of that Eaſterne Land, above 7. Leagues.64. deg. 30. m.
               
               Being thus at a Non plus himſelfe by obſervation, the day before, &amp; by his reckoning ſince, to be as far Northerly fully, as 65. d. It troubled him ſomething, and eſpecially to ſee the Eaſterne Land to treul away Southerly: well the wind comming about to N. N. E. hee came out of this hee called a Bay,

and ſaith hee was enforced therein by extremity of a S. W. wind, and yet hee ſaith that by his not far ſtanding from the Weſt ſide, this Bay cannot be above 16. or 17. Leagues over, from Land to Land, and in his running hee found the depth of it to be not above 4. and 5. and 30. Leagues.
               But as a wiſe Gentleman, and one well underſtood in the Rules of Navigation, who having exactly ſurveyd theſe journall

               About 5. in the afternoone, the wind encreaſed to a great ſtorme, he tooke in his Sayles, and went away with a free andNo courſe ſo named. ſprit ſayle, having 46. Fadome, and betweene 7. and 8. hee came after to 62. Fadome, and in a cleere hee ſaw the Land E. and by S. 3. Leagues off: From the time that he ſet ſayle, this afternoone untill 8. at night, he ranne 7. Leagues S. S. W. the wind at N. N. E. At Clock 10. hee ſtood S. E. hoping to have found the Land to wind away, and running but ⅓. of an houre, he came to ſmooth water upon a ſuddaine, and had but 26. Fadome. And the weather being yet hazie, hee ſaw the Land faire by him, bearing E. S. E. very high Land, then he edg'd of untill midnight S. S. E. Eaſterly, having come ſince 8. a Clock, 5. Leagues.
               From Midnight Land ſtill in Verioe he edg'd off W. N. W. and at 2. in the morning hee came into 65. Fadome, then hee edg'd of W. and S. W. and S. S. W. untill 4. in the morning, when the ſtorme was ſo violent that he was driven to ſteere away before it, with his fore courſe, at 5. this morning by the extremity of the Sea, he ſunk his long Boate.
               All this morning he ſteered untill S. S. S. W. 5. Laagues along the ſhoare, and every ſtache hee ſaw the Land not above 3. Leagues from him, from 8. untill Noone hee ſteered S. 5. Leagues, then the ſtorme began to leſſon, and he put out more Sayle: And this Eaſterne Land hee ſaw to beare S. S. E. Eaſterly from him, and lyeth as neere as he could Iudge S. Weſterly, and Weſterly.
               From Noone untill Midnight, hee ſtood away S. S. E. 13. Leagues, and from Midnight untill this noone S. S. E. 6 Leagues, and 4. Leagues, S. S. W.
               31. This day at Noone it was cleere, and by his obſervation

N. E. and to N. E. by E. he tacks about to the Southwards, having run N. wards 4 Leagues, N. by E. about 8. it blew to both Bonnets off: and hee ſtood with two courſes, making way untill Midnight S. and by E. 2. Leagues, and other 2. Leagues, untill 4. S. and by E.
               10. This morning he lay to Hull, the weather extreame andAuguſt. hazie and ſo thick, that he could not ſee a piſtalſhot from him, in this time hee drew 2. Leagues S. S.

                     ll this day about 2. leagues off, beating from E. to S. He writeth that the ſight of it grieved him much, ſo that now he made himſelfe aſſured of that which he did but doubt before; which was, that they joyne to the Eaſterne part of the Bay from whence he came: but I doe otherwiſe beleeve.
               All the afternoone he ſtood a long the ſhore edging into 7.Auguſt. fathom, and croſſe a Race, which ſet N. E. and S. W. and continued about halfe a Glaſſe. At 4. a clock the N. W. point of the land did beare from him N. W. by N. about a mile of: then ſteering within leſſe then one mile of this Cape-land, for ſo it was; and a faire one of a low one as ever hee ſaw; you ſhall have 9. and 10. fathom: and ſhall open a very ſafe Bay, the Eaſterne land whereof will beare from you E. by N. 4. leagues off.
               In this Bay he handed all his ſayles, thinking to have riddeA good Bay to anchor in. and watered: but his anchor being downe, and his Boat almoſt out, one of his Maſters Mates ſaid he deſcried land from the top Maſt head S. and by E. the newes whereof made him wonder for that they all knew this was the land they had ſeene the laſt yeere, which they tookt to be an Iland. He ſent up Captaine Ingram, who aſſured him it was land; whereupon he hoyſed up his anchor, and ſet ſayle, and ſtood S. and by E. and S. and came into 30. fathom: ſo miſſing this land, heeA land of fogge. anchored (night at hand) in 30, fathom.
               At 2, this morning he weighed to better his deepe, and to goe neere the land, he thought he had ſeene in 2. Glaſſes, hee leſſed his deepe 3. fathom: ſo ſteering S. S. E. he came to 46. and 56. fathom in 2. Glaſſes.
               About 5. in the morning the wind came about to the N. by E. he ſtands E. cloſe upon a wind, and came to 125. at noone, without ſight of land, whereby hee was aſſured that it was the imagined laſt yeeres Iland.
               From yeſterday noone, untill this noone, 14. leagues S. E. by E. and 6. leagues E, N. E. the weather ſomewhat cleare, but not fit to make obſervation, after noone the Gale hards on, he ſtrooke his lofty ſayles; the Sea ſomewhat growne, the day cleereſt and faireſt of 16. or 17. dayes before.
               
                  From noone this day until midnight E. N. E. 8. leag. this night 11. the weather grew bad, and hee ſaith the Sea beat of his Beaks head, at which time he took in ſayles, and came to Hull.
               
               From midnight before, untill this day noone hee drive on Hull 3. leagues S. S. E, the weather foggie raine, and wind but ſomewhat leſſe.
               At 2. in the morning the ſtorme being broke up, and Sea downe, he ſet ſayles, and had driven ſince noone before S. S. E. 4, leagues, the winde betwixt N. N. E. and N. E.
               At 8. this morning he had 50. fathom, the thick was cleered,He named this Mancels Iland. and he ſee land to beare on him Eaſt.
               From 2. this morning the time of his ſetting of ſayle, hee made N. E. by N. Northerly, 7. leagues; the morning was foggie, but the day proved faire.
               At noone they had a good obſervation; and all that didLat. 61. d. 38. m.
                   obſerve agreed in one, and to be in 61. d. 38. m. Latitude: hee made way to the ſhore, E. by N. Northerly, 2. leagues, and came to an anchor at clock 2. in 17. fathom, the land bearing from N. E. by N. to E. S. E.
               After 3. this afternoone the winde comming to the E. N. E. he ſet ſayle and ſtood to the Northward; and about 5. this evening coaſting along the ſhore, the Northland ſeemed like ſmall Ilands, and broken lands; the ſight whereof made him deſirous to put in amongſt them, but the winde would not permit: at clock 5. the weather thickned, and the land bore from N. E. Eaſterly, to S. E. from him 4. leagues. This land was a very low and a ſmooth land, from hence he ſtood off to the Weſtward till midnight; his depth from 14. to 95. fathom, his courſe W. N. W. Northerly 7. leagues.
               At Midnight having the ſame depth, the wind was at noone N. northerly, he ſtood about to eaſtward 10. Leagues E. N. E.
               Somewhat before noone this day it cleered, and in 12. Fadome, hee ſaw the Land 2. Miles off, and upon the ſame hee ſaw 5. white Beares, ſo ſtanding of the coller of his main ſtay broke, which cauſed him to beare up with the S. moſt part of the Land he ſaw, to the intent to lend his Boate on Land for water, and to try from whence the flood came; at 1. in the afternoon he anchored in a Bay in 4. Fadome ſmooth groud, but rockie, for he could ſee it under him: He ſent his man well

mand and armed, who found water inſtantly, they found notDead mens skulls and bones. farre from them 2. old houſes broken, and fallen downe to the ground, wherein were the skulls and bones of deadmen.
               Images and toyes ſuch as they found by digging with their hands, under the ruines of the decayed houſes, with ſome dozenAuguſt. of ſmall Mors teeth.
               His opinion is that this were the ruines of ſome, who by miſchance had miſcarried there by wrack of their Boate, or being inforced to water there, made their beſt proviſion they could to endure it, but the extremity being ſo ſtrong for them, and the place neither affording meanes for them to repaire their Canooes, (the ruines whereof he found ſome) for fuell for fire to comfort them in Winter, hee geſſes this killedRuines of houſes and Canooes in Manſells Ile. them, for had they beene any other then ſuch as were thus enforced by ſuch extremity, they would not have left ſuch things behind them as they found, for there nature is whereſoever they come to have few things of worth or value behind them, much leſſe doth hee thinke they have left their Images, which hee perveiveth they account their gods: AndImages and Mans teeth. there was Mors teeth, for which and the treyne thereof they make all their Sommers travells and labours.
               Thus his Boate having brought him water, he ried all that day with wind of Land, and obſerved that the flood came from N. and the ebbe from S. making a full ſtay that day betweeneFlood came from N. 3. and 4. a Clocke,
               Having watered he weighed and ſteered untill 4. this morning N. W. by W. 7. Leagues, the wind N. N. E.

               From midnight untill morning 6. he ſtood in E. N. ½. northerly 4. Leagues, he tackt about untill 10. a Clock 3. Leagues N. W. and by N.
               
               At which time hee came to an Anchor in 85. Fadome, and found the tyde of Flood to come from the N. Land ebbe from the S. and ruld within 6. or 7. Leagues of ſhore, it bearing N.

               From 7. this morning untill 2. in the afternoone, hee ſtood to the E. ward, and made way 4. Leagues N. E. and by E.
               From 2. the wind wearing he ſtood to the E. ward, and made way untill midnight 7. Leagues N. W.
               From midnight untill morning hee held the ſame courſe 4. Leagues N. W. northerly, it grew calme, and he was within 5. Leagues of a faire Head land; hee came to Anchor in 65. Fadome, the Land bare from the N. N. W. to the W. S. W. both Lands hee deemed to bee diſtant 10. Leagues, (it being calme with windward Tyde) hee wayed Anchor, hoping to get to the Northward of this faire Head land, and that the height of that Land would bring him into deeper water.
               After he was looſ'd, he was ſagged into the Bay from 62. toLa. 62. d. 38. m 50. fathome, a ſmall gale comming on hee ſtood off into 60. fathome, when it fell calme he anchored againe: this day was faire and cleere, he obſerued in 62. d. 38. m. This Cape was a very faire Head land; and the northerne part is much higher then the weſterne, but it is all, the other Land is of this ſtraight, except 15. leagues on this ſide his wintering place, which was woody, elſe on this ſide it is all barred and rockie, but a bad ſhoare to ſaile along.
               This forenoone calme but faire and cleere weather, and the onely Somers day hee had ſince his comming from his wintering, being at Anchor bewixt the Cape and the W. point, he ſaw the Land to make with two Bayes, the further point of the ſoutherne Bay, being from the northerne Land of that Bay W. and by S. ſoutherly, and the North point E. and by N. northerly: And the other Bay from this point to the Cape it ſelfe lieth E. northerly, and S. weſterly, at noone he obſerved in 62. d. 42. m.
               At 4. the afternoone he ſet ſayle, and with ſmall winde atLa. 62. d. 42. m 5. he ſtood with the Cape, the weather being cleere and faire,

hee ſent to the Cape to turne the Tyde, being thwart of the Cape, the point is low with an underland, and ſome 2. Cables length from ſhore ia a low flat little Iland; the land you ſhall open to the Northward, lieth N. W. Weſterly, hee boat or bore, he edged of, and anchored within one mile of the land, having opened the land to the weſtward of the Cape; he anchored 15. fathom, and rid there all night to try the tyde, for that his Boat had brought word that it was ebbe tyde, and that it ſet to the Northward which did agree with the tyde, he found on the Eaſtland where hee watered: but from the time he now anchored being between 10. and 11. at night, and 3. the next morning, he ſet ſayle, hee could not finde any certainty, but what followed.
               This morning was calme, but the night before was full ofNo mention of Ice. ſtrange Harbours as they call them, which is a ſtreame in the Element, like the flame that commeth forth the mouth of a a hot oven, which upon this Coaſt how faire ſoever the weather bee when you ſee them, yet it is an infallible ſigne of a ſtorme to follow within 24. houres after, as it proved by this and divers times before.
               At 3. this morning without certenty of the Tyde, a ſmall gale S. he wayed and adviſed with Captaine Gibbins, and Captaine Ingram, and with the reſt, what courſe was beſt to bee taken? they reſolved this Land falling away N. W. and by W. weſterly, and having 113. Fadome within a Mile of the ſhore, to ſtand away N. N. W. alougſt the ſhore, reſolving not to leave this Land untill he were fully ſatisfied, ſtanding thus untill 8. at night, being ſome 7. Leagues of the Cape, he ſaw an Iland of the weſtermoſt Land, that bore from him W. N. W. 7. or 8 Leagues off, hee had then 100. Fathome, and ſtood N. N. W. as before.
               At noone the weather was cloſe and began to blow, heeSir Thomas Button doth allovv 2. points variation. was then 15. Leagues N. N. W. from the Cape; he doth not write whether true courſe or no, but in all the former Hopes Advance unto this Cape: I have writ by him according to the true courſe, and had 95. Fadome, which made him aſſure himſelfe, that the Land winded a way more northerly, and thereupon at noone hee ſtood away N. E. and by N. hoping that courſe would have bettered his depth, but on the contrary, for in 2. glaſſes he ſhoalded to 60. Fathoms, then he

hayled away E. S. E. aſſuring what experience had often ſhown him, that as the water ſhoalded, ſo the Land winded.
               At 3. in the afternoone the weather thick, the wind increaſing, and hee in 60. Fathome, knowing there was no better depth to the N. ward: hee ſtood E. S. E. till 8. at night, having 50. Fathome, the weather bad and night at hand, hee ſtood about, and kept it up with ſhort ſayle, all that night betweene S. W. and by W. and W. S. W.
               From midnight till 7. this morning; as from 8. laſt night, till midnight, thus ſtanding, brought him into 80. fathom, he caſt about to the Eaſtward with much winde, at S. S. W. hazy and thick weather; he heeled it up in courſes and Bonnets till clock 2. they being ſtarke calmed as it is a ſpeciall note, every Blower ends with a ſtarke calme in thoſe parts, being then in 65. fathom E. he anchored and rid untill 4. in the evening, when a ſmal gale riſing at S. S. W. he waighed, and ſtood S. E. guiding himſelfe by his depth, for the winde would not give him leave to better his hopes.
               17. From midnight to 8. this morning, as the night before, &amp; after that time, there is ſmall worth the Luke to write upon thaverſe; and his greateſt depth 140. fathom, untill the next day in the afternoone, and then he had ſight of the ſame Cape he ſent his Boat unto the 14. day before. It bore from him N. N. W. by compaſſe about 7. leagues, ſo he ſteered S. S. W. untill midnight, having runne ſince he ſet ſayle at 2. in the afternoone 10. leagues S. E. and by E.
               Concluding he writeth that he came to 43. fathom, which

               This morning day light, he ſee the land bearing from S. W. by S. at which time he had 65. fathom.
               19. From 2. this morning untill noone, he made away E.

                  8 by N. 10. leagues. At 7. he ſaw land on head at leaſt 12. leagues of him; he judged it to bee the high land of the Maine within Sir Dudley Diggs his Iland, and yet to beare of him as it did, it was ſtrange unto him: but he ſaith that Captaine Gibbons confidence was ſuch, as that hee muſt not let paſſe unſpoken of; for albeit that hee is ſo neere in blood, as that modeſtie

will not allow of his ſpeaking too much of his merit, yet heeCapt. Gibbons.
                   will boldly ſay thus much of his ſufficiency, as hee aſſures himſelfe he ſhall make it appeare at his returne, if God pleaſe to let him live ſo long, as that he is not ſhort of any man that ever yet he carried to Sea. All that he can ſay of him further is, that for his Countries good, and for the advancement of this buſineſſe we have in hand; he could wiſh his body were anſwerable to his other abilities; which were it; not himſelfe, but many, and bis Country moſt would bee the better for it. But that God that made us all of duſt, will not faile to raiſe up ſome good ſpirits he hopes for the further proſecution of this buſineſſe: as that by their honeſt endeavours, and religious Reſolutions, they will effect that which as yet is not ripe for his Sickle: but that God which beſt knowes what the truth of his endeavours have beene in this buſineſſe, he hopes will not faile to give a bleſſing to ſome that ſhall follow; and for his part he deſires to be bleſt no otherwiſe, than as he hath ſincerely laboured in it; and therefore he muſt conclude and ever beleeve according to the word, that Paul plants, Apollo waters, and God gives the increaſe. So that untill his good will and pleaſure is, all that we doe cannot in this ought elſe prevaile.
               At noone the weather faire and cleare he had a good obſervation, by which Captaine Gibbons was well aſſured; but himſelfe and ſome others diſcenting from him in the bearing ofSet of Tyde. the land from them, were deceived in the ſet of the tyde, which in his going out laſt yeere, mightily carried him to the Northward, as now as much to the Southward; which then, nor till now, was not found by any of them all.
               He ſteered open of the Land N. N. E. with tyde 5. leagues, untill evening 4. and at 2. he had 307. fathom.
               At 6. in the evening ſmall winde, C. Wolſtenholme bore S. E. 7. leagues of the Weſterne point of the weſterne Iland, S. E. by S. ½. S. 5. leagnes off, he kept it up that he might get about the Weſtermoſt point of Nottinghams Iland; (it lying 8. leagues from Diggs his Iland, there thinking to trie the tyde; and from thence he purpoſed to goe to the N. maine betweene Salisbury and Nottinghams Ile, to try the diſtance betweene them, it being all he could doe for this yeere.
               About 8. this morning the weather thick, and he not above

4. leagues from Ile Nottingham in 64. fathom he anchored, and as he remembreth to his comfort being ebbe, hee found it a very ſtrong one from S. S. E. to S. E. and by S.But was deceived.
               
               At noone ſlack, it was a freſh gale at S. W. hee waighed to get about to the Weſtward of the Iland, about 2; it blew hard, and was thick weather with raine and thunder, and within a mile of the ſhore. It fell ſtarke calme upon a ſudden, then he was iu a great ripling in 20. fathom water, the Sea all breaches round about him like a Raffe, which deſerying, he ſtood off with little winde along the Iland, and found his drift moreHalf an hower. in leſſe then in one Glaſſe. Then hee could run a head before with both top-ſayles on trip, and a ſtiffe gale in 2. houres, hee came to anchor to be fully ſatisfied of the tyde.
               But when the tyde came, it came with ſuch force &amp; ſtrengthA ſtrong tyde. Not ſo. out of the N. W. and by N. as hee had much adoe to ride at, and could not have ridde it had not he ſteered the ſhip all the tyde time: the

               At 8. this night the weather being a little cleere, with ebbe he wayed and plied to windward to get about the N. W. end of the Iland; and being about the Weſt point, the ebbe being d

W. in 33. fathoms, the weather thick and bad, he anchored, where in leſſe than one houre the tyde of flood came moſt ſtrong as before, from N. W. and by N. whereby he concluded, having brought the Northerne point N. from him, tha
                     •
                   it was the true Channell tyde; for had it beene otherwiſe,The true Channell tyde. it would have come as the land lay, which was N. but now being open of the land, and finding it to come from the N. W. and by N. he faith in his judgement that courſe, and N. N. W. muſt direct whomſoever ſhall ſeeke this paſſage hereafter. And the rather to continue himſelfe in this opinion, he now to late found, that thoſe that were this way firſt, &amp; himſelfe the laſt yeere were all of them deceived of the ſet of the tyde, within Sir Dudley Diggs his Iland, for there they found it come more Weſterly, which was cauſed by many broken

Ilands that lye to the Weſtward of it, which he never ſawe, untill his returne homewards. And upon this tyde (if I can judge ſaith he, we cannot be deceived for this caveat, he dothStrong Tyde, or 200. fathom give to whomſoever ſhall ſucceed him in this diſcovery. That whenſoever he loſeth his ſtrong tyde, or finds ground in 200. fathoms, let himſelfe he is out of his direct courſe for finding of this Voyage. So this his experience upon his unhappy counter-courſe taught him, that whenſoever it is to be found, it muſt bee in deepe water); and in a ſtrong tyde; and in this courſe that he took, he hopes it will not be imputed an errour of his; for what he did in the directing of it; for it was to follow the letter of his inſtructions; For albeit he was preciſely tyed to ſtand with Hudſons Weſterland in 58. d. yet he never came much to Leeward of 61. d. till he was encountered with land 200. leagues Weſtward from Sir Dudley Diggs

Whale finnes, with a few Seale skins which hee tooke with him, leaving for them knifes, beades and counters, hee found a little Bay where were the Images of men, and one the Image of a woman, with a childImages. at her back which he brought with him.
               Amongſt theſe Tents being 5. in number, all covered with Seales skins, were running 35. or 40. Dogs, the moſt of them muzled, there were of a Mungrills Maſtiffe, being of a brinded black colour, looking almoſt like Wolves: thoſe Dogs they uſe in ſtead of Horſes, or as the Laplanders doe their Deere, to draw their Steedes which are ſhot or lyned with bones of great fiſhes, to keepe them from wearing, theirDogsfurnitur. Dogs have collers and furniture very fitting.
               Their apparell Boates, and Tents, with other neceſſaries, are much like to thoſe of Greneland, but not ſo neate and artificiall: they ſeeme to bee more rude and uncivill travelling up and downe, as their fiſhing is in ſeaſon, for in moſt placesLattude 62. d. 32. m. Longitude 72. d. where they were on Land, they ſee where people had beene, but where their habitation or winter aboad is they know not, nor cannot conjecture.
               This Iland lyeth in 62. degrees, 32. minutes, and in longitude Weſt from London 72. degrees or neere there about, being 60. Leagues from the entrance of the ſtraights: the compaſſe doth vary 27. degrees, 30. minutes, and South Eaſt MooneVariation 27. d. 30 m. 4. degrees Eaſt, maketh full Sea, it floweth almoſt as much water as at Reſolution, the Tyde commeth from the Eaſtwards.
               This day morning 6. he ſet ſayle with North winde, which continued not, but was variable, till noone, it came to North Weſt, hee having ſayled along the ſhore ſome 7½. leagues North North Weſt, the Ice lying ſo thick in the Offing, thatA good Harbor. he could not well get out of it. He perceived a good Harbor betweene two ſmall Ilands and the maine, and went in, wherre he moord and ſtayd untill the twelfe day in the evening.
               In this place a South Eaſt Moone make a full Sea, Latitude62. d. 40. m. Lat. S. E. full Sea. 62. degrees, 40. m. the tyde doth come from South Eaſt every point hath his ſet and eddy in this place hee could perceive of no people.
               
                  Lying ſtill in the Ice, the weather cloſe and hazy, as it had beene for 6. dayes being neere a great company of Ilands (the winde Weſt North Weſt,) he ſtood in amongſt them and at evening, morne to one of them in a ſmall Cove, the, better to defend her from the Ice; here hee ſtood all the 17. day, the 18. being almoſt calme, he ſet ſayle, the better to get forth. Here was a great company of Ilands, each whereof hath his ſeverall ſets and eddyes, which drive the Ice to and againe with ſuch violence, that hee was in greater danger here, then if he had beene further off, the Latitude of this Ile he lay at, was 63. d. 26. m. longitude, neere 72. d. 15. m. from London, Variation 27. d. 46. m. ½. paſt 9. the change day makethDanger neare ſhore, La. 63. d 26. Lon. 72. d. 25. m. Variati. 27. d 46. m. full Sea, this evening and morning he had a falſe gale at South Eaſt, and he ſtood along by the land, it being all ſmall broken Ilands, to a point about 12. leagues diſtance from the Ile he ſet from, it being all broken land, ſo calls it broken point.
               This day 12. he was about 4. miles from the foreſaid point, faſt amongſt Ice; and he ſaith, he might well have called this Fairenes, or Faire Point; for from this day to the 30. the weather was ſo faire, and almoſt altogether ſo calme, that in few places elſe where fairer weather could not be; and untill the 27. hee was ſo faſt incloſed amongſt the Ice, that one could not dip water by the Ship ſides. Vpon the 29. day he ſee the Sunne and Moone both at one time, as indeed in faire weather is uſuall in thoſe parts.
               Being faire and calme, the Sea almoſt as ſteady as on ſhore, with his Inſtruments for Variation, hee went to worke to take the time of the Moones comming to the Meridian, and had a Quadrant of 6. foote Semidiamiter ready to take Sols Almicanter, having taken the Variation of his Needle as properly as he could, which was 28. d. 10. m.
               
               The Sunnes Almicanter at the inſtant, when the MooneObſervaton for Longitude was upon the Meridian, was 26. d. 40. m. the Sunnes declination 23. d 6. m. by which 3. things given he found the houre to be 5. a clock, 4. m. 54 ſecon. ⅓ 4 / 4 or 67. d. 13. m. 16. ſ. of the Equinoctiall, after noone, and according to Scarls Ephemerides the Moone came to the Meridian at London, at 4. a clock, 54. m. 30 ſ. and after Origanus, the Moone came to the Meridian at 4. a clock, 52. m. 5. ſ. at Wittenberg the ſame day now

having this knowne, it is no hard matter to know the Longitude of this place ſought; for according to the Moones meane motion, which is 12. d. a day, it is in time 48 m. and to this account, if ſhee bee on the Meridian at 12. of clocke this day. tomorrow it will be 48. m. paſt 12. ſo hee having the time found by obſervation at this place, viz. 5. houres, 4. m. 52. ſ. ⅓ 4 / 4. but in this he needeth not come 50. preciſe, and at London at 4. houres, 54. m. 30. ſ, which ſubſtracted from the former, leaveth 10. m. 22 ſ. ⅓ 4 / 4. Now the Moones motion, that 24. houres was 22 d. 38. m. which converted into time, is 50. m. 25. ſ. 20. th. then the protion ſtandeth thus, if 50. m. 25. ſ. 20. th. give 360. d. what ſhall 10. m. 22. ſ. ⅓ 4 / 4. give the propotionals welbes, 74. d. South, which is Weſt of London, becauſe the Moone came later by 10. m. 22. ſ. and by the working of Origanus his Ephemerides, the diſtance is 91. d. 35. m. Weſt of Weſt, but whether be the truer, hee leaves it to others to judge; for if thoſe workings bee not carefully looked unto, there may be great errour committed; as in the obſervation, and in the Moones comming to the Meridian to the place, for which the Ephemerider was Calulated for, and it may be in the Ephemerides themſelves; in all which, the beſt and moſt judicious may erre.
               The 6. of Aprill another outward bound at Sea, by the Moones comming in a right line, with two fixed Starres; the one was the Lions heart, a Starre of the firſt magnitude, the other in the Lions Rumps, of ſecond magnitude, as followeth.
               The Circumference or outward eye of the Moones being in a right or ſtraight line, with thoſe two Starres before named, at the inſtance he tooke the Altitude of the South ballance, 2. d. 38. m. becauſe he would ſave the time, but in this it is good to waite a fit time, as to gave her in a right line, with 2. Starres not farre diſtant, and thoſe not to be much difference in longitude, becauſe the Moone will ſoone alter, the auyle or potion, and ſuch a time would bee taken, when the wood is in the 19. of the Ecliptique above the Horizon, for then there is no parallel of Longitude, but onely in Latitude: but who is painefull in theſe buſineſſes, ſhall ſoone ſee what is needfull, and what is not his obſervations, were as followeth.

Fowles, for in this place is the greateſt ſtore of thoſe fowles which we call Willicks, that in few places elſe is not to be ſeen; for if need were he might have killed many thouſand; almoſt incredible to thoſe that have not ſeene it; here he had ſufficient proofe of other tyde: but when his Boate returned, he ſet ſayle homewards.

E. moone, and neere 4. fatho. he found people at Salvage Iſles, he was much troubled, but eſpecially at Mill Iſle, he made Cape Comfort, and found a tyde, but knew not from whence it come. The land to the N. treads about him to N. E. by E. the water the farther Northward, was but more ſhallow &amp; dirty, he returnes homewards the 10. of Iuly, his greateſt deep at 180. fathoms. In his returne at Sea-horſe Point, he and al his people ſaw, that plainly the tyde came from S. E. as alſo at Iſle Nottingham he broke in a planck and timber of his ſhip amongſt Ice, he might have killed thouſands of Fowle at Diggs his Iſland; his greateſt Variation was 27. d. 46. m. his greateſt Lat. was 65. d. 25. m. he ſaw many Sea Mors, at Cape Comfort; his Longitude from London was 86. d. 10. m.

               Maſter Baffyne his Letter to the right Worſhipfull Sir Iohn Wolitenholme one of the chiefe Adventurers for the diſcovery of a paſſage to the North weſt.
               VVOrthy Sir, there needs no filling a Iournall or ſhort Diſcourſe with Preamble circumſtance or complement; and therefore I will onely tell I am proud of my remembrance, when I expreſſe your worth to my capacity; and gal

                   of any good fortune, when I can avoyde the imputation of ingratitude, by acknowledgeing your many favours; and ſeeing it is not unknowne to your Worſhip in what eſtate the buſineſſe concerning the North Weſt hath beene heretofore; and how the onely hope was in ſearching Fretum Davis; which if your ſelfe had not beene the more forward, the Action had wel-nigh beene left of. Now it remaineth for your Worſhip to know what hath beene performed this yeare; wherefore I intreat you to admit of my cuſtome, and pardon me if I take the plaine highway in relating the particulars without uſing any refined Phraſes, or eloquent ſpeeches.
               Therefore briefly thus, and as it were in the Fore-front I entred to ſhew the whole proceeding of the Voyage in a word, as namely, there is no Paſſage nor hope of Paſſage in the North of Davis Straight. Wee having coaſted all, or neere all the Circumference thereof, and finde it to be no other then a great Bay, as the Voyage doth truely ſhow: therefore I cannot but much admire the worke of the Almighty, when I conſider how vaine the beſt and chiefeſt hopes of men are in things uncertaine; and to ſpeake of no other matter than the hopefull paſſage to the North Weſt. How many of the beſt ſort of men have ſet their whole endeavours to proove a paſſage that way? not onely in their Conference, but alſo in writing and publiſhing the Worke: Yea what great ſummes of money having beene ſpent about the Action, as your Worſhip hath coſtly experience of?

Iournals, if they had not beene confident of a paſſage this way; that if it had pleaſed GOD a paſſage had beene found, they might have eclipſed the worthy prayſe of the Adventurers, and true Diſcoverers. And for mine owne part I would hardly have beleeved the contrary, untill my eyes became witneſſes of that I deſired not to have found, ſtill taking occaſion of hope on very likelihood till ſuch time as wee had coaſted almoſt all the Circumference of this great Ba

                  t Hope Saunderſon, to have taken notice of the Tydes; For to that place which is 72. deg. ½▪ the Sea is all open, and of an unſearchable depth, and of a good colour, onely the Tydes keepe a certaine courſe, nor riſe but a ſmall height, as 
                     •
                  ight or nine foote; and the Flood commeth from the Southward; and in all the Bay beyond that place the Tyde is ſo ſmall, and not much to bee regarded: yet by reaſon of Snow melting on the Land, the Ebbe is ſtronger than the Flood, by meanes whereof, and the windes holding Northerly, the fore part of the yeere the great Ile of Ice are ſet to the Southward, ſome into Fretum Hudſon, and other into New-foundland: For in all where the Channell is open, are great quantities of them driving up and downe; and till this yeere not well knowne where they were become.
               Now that the worſt is knowne concerning this Paſſage; it is neceſſary and requiſite your Worſhip ſhould underſtand what probability and hope of profit might here bee made hereafter, if the Voyage might bee attempted by fitting men. And firſt, for the killing of Whales, certaine it is, that in this Bay are great numbers of them, which the Biſcaver calls the Guard Bay▪ Whales of the ſame kinde which are killed at Greeneland, and as it ſeemeth to mee eaſie to bee ſtrooke, becauſe they are not uſed to bee chaſed or beaten. For wee being but one day in Whale-
                     •
                  ound, ſo called, for the number of Whales wee ſaw there ſleeping and lying alo
                     ••
                   on the water, nor fearing our Shippe, or ought elſe▪ 
                  
                     •
                  or if wee had beene fitted with men and things neceſſarie, it had beene no hard matter to have ſtrooke more then

would have made three Ships a ſaving Voyage; and that it is of that ſort of Whales, there is no feare, I being twice at Greeneland, tooke ſufficient notice to know them againe, beſides a dead Whale wee found at Sea, having all her Finnes: or rather all the Roughs of her mouth; of which with ſmall labour wee got a hundred and ſixty the ſame evening wee found her: and if fowle weather the next day had not followed, no doubt wee had got all, or the moſt part of them: But the winde and Sea riſing, ſhee broke from us, and wee were forced to leave her. Neither are they onely to bee looked for in Whale Sound, but alſo in Smiths Sound, Wolſtenholmes Sound, and others, &amp;c.
               For the killing of Sea-mors I can give no certainty, but onely this: that our Boate being but once a ſhoare in all the North part of this Bay, which was in the entrance of Alderman IONES his Sound; at their returne our Men told us they ſawe many Mors along by the ſhoare on the Ice: but our Ship being under ſayle, and the winde comming faire, they preſently came on board without further ſearch; beſides the people inhabiting about 74. degrees▪ tould us by divers ſignes, that towards the North there were many of thoſe Beaſts having two long teeth; and ſhewed us divers pieces of the ſame.
               As for the Vnicorne, it being a great Fiſh, having a long horne borne growing forth of his forehead or noſtrils (ſuch as Sir MARTIN FROBISHER in his ſecond Voyage found one) in divers places wee ſee of them: which if the horne be of any good value, no doubt but many of them maybe killed.
               As concerning what the ſhoare will yeeld, as Beares skins, Mors teeth, and ſuch like; I can ſay little, becauſe we came not on Land in any of thoſe places where hope was of finding them.
               But here ſome may object why wee ſought that Coaſt no better? To this I anſwere, that whileſt we were thereabouts, the weather was ſo exceeding fowle wee could not; for firſt wee anchored in Wolſtenholmes Sound, where preſently wedrove with two anchors on head, then we were forced to ſtand forth with a low ſayle; the next day in

Whale Sound we loſt Anchor and Cable, and could fetch the place no more; then wee came to Anchor neere a ſmall Iland, being betweene Sir Thomas Smiths Sound, and Whales Sound: but the winde came more outward, that wee were forced to weigh againe. Nevertheleſſe, if we had beene in a good Harbor, having but our Ships Boat we durſt not ſend her farre from the Ship, having ſo few men as 17. in all, and ſome of them very weake: but the chiefe cauſe why wee ſpent too little time to ſeeke a Harbor, was our great deſire to performe the diſcovery; having the Sea open in all that part, and ſtill likelihood of a paſſage: but when we had coaſted the land ſo farre to the S. ward, that hope of a paſſage was none, then the yeere was too far ſpent, and many of our men very weake, and withall we having ſome beliefe that Ships the next yeare would be ſet forth about the killing of whales which might doe better then we.
               And ſeeing I have briefly ſet downe what hopes there is of making a profitable Voyage, it is not unfit your Worſhip ſhould know what let or hindrance may be to the ſame; the chiefeſt cauſe is, that ſome yeares it may happen by reaſon of Ice lying between 72. ½▪ and 76. ſo that the Ships cannot come into thoſe parts untill the middle of Iuly, ſo that want of time to ſtay in the Country may bee ſome let, yet they may well tarry untill the laſt of Auguſt: in which ſpace much buſineſſe may be done, and great ſtore of oyle made. Nevertheleſſe, if ſtore of Whales come in, as no feare to the contrary; what cannot be made in Oyle, may bee brought home in Blubber, and the Finnes may ariſe to good profit. Another hinderance will be, becauſe the bottome of the Sound will not be ſo ſoone cleare as would bee wiſhed; by meanes whereof, now and then a Whale may be loſt. The ſame cauſe ſometime hapneth in Greeneland. Yet I am perſwaded the Sounds before, no
                     •
                   never will be cleare before the 20. of Iuly. Wee this yeere were in Whales Iland the 4. day amongſt many Whales, and might have ſtrooke them without let of Ice.
               Furthermore, there is little wood to bee expected either for fire, or other neceſſaries; therefore Coales and other ſuch things muſt be provided at home, they will bee much more the ready there.
               Thus much I thought good to certifie to your Worſhip,

whom I hope will conceive, that much time hath not beene ſpent in vaine or the like buſineſſe, nor careleſly neglected, and although wee have not performed what wee deſired (that is to have the paſſage) yet what wee have promiſed, as to bring certainty, and a true deſcription truth will make manifeſt, that I have not much erred.
               And I doe boldly ſay (without boaſting) that more good diſcovery hath not in ſhorter time (to my rememrance) beene done ſince the Account was attempted, conſidering how much Ice we have paſſed, and the difficulty of Sayling ſo neere the Pole upon a travis.
               And above all the variation of the compaſſe whoſe wonderfull opperation is ſuch in this Bay, encreaſing and decreaſing ſo ſuddainely, and ſwift being in ſome part, as in Wolſtenholmes

               In fine, whatſoever my labours are or ſhall be, I eſteeme too little to expreſſe my thankfull mind, for your many favours wherein I ſhall be ever ſtudious to ſupply my other wants, by my beſt endeavours, and ever reſt at your worſhips command.

Whereupon he was forced to weigh and ſtand forth, he called this ſound, Wolftenholmes Sound; It hath many Inlets or ſmaller ſounds; and is a fit place for killing of Whales.
                     Wolſtenholmes Sound.
               
               This morning a ſtorme began at Weſt, that blew away his fore-courſe, continuing ſo, that he was not able to beare any ſayle, but lay to Hull; and when it cleared up, he found himſelfe imbayed in a great Sound: then he ſet ſayle and ſtood over to the S.

               In this ſound was great number of Whales; hee called it Whale-ſound in latitude 77. 30. this day was faire weather, and he kept along by the land: untill he came unto a great banke of yce which was backt with land; which hee ſeeing, determined to ſtand backe againe ſome 8. leagues to an Iſland he called Hauclites Ile.

For by divers good obſervations heeVariation 56. found it to bee above 5. points, or 56. varied to the N. ward, this Sound ſeemeth to bee good for killing of Whales, it being the greateſt and largeſt in all the Bay, the cauſe why he minded to ſtand to this Iſland, was to ſeeke for Whale-Finnes; this night he Anchored with foule weather, that his Boate could not land: the next day the Wind more outward, 9. the Sea growne ſo that he wayed, ſpending two dayes before he could get a good place to Anchor in.
               This day it cleared up and he ſpyed a company of Iſlands lying

W. in the South-ſea, along the coaſt of Nova Hiſpaniae, and Califirnia and India, now called North America; all which voyage hee ſignified vnto me in a great Mappe and Carde of my owne which I laide before him, vntill hee came to the Latitude of 47. degrees. and that there finding the land to trent N. and N. E. with a broad Inlett betweene 47. and 48. hee being entred thereinto; ſayling therein more then twenty dayes, and found the land trenting ſtill ſometimes N. W. and ſometimes N. E. and alſo S. E. ward, a farre broader Sea then at the ſaid entrance; and that hee paſſed by divers Ilands in that entrance: and that at the entrance of this ſaid Streight, there is on the North-weſt coaſt thereof a great Head-land or Iland, with an exceeding high Pinnacle or ſpired Rocke like a piller there-vpon.
               Alſo he ſaid, that hee went on land indivers places; and that hee ſaw ſome people on land clad in Beaſt-skinns: and that the land was very fruitfull, and rich of gold and ſilver and Pearles and other things like Nova Hiſpaniae,
               
               Alſo hee ſaid, that hee being entred thus farre into the ſaid10 Streight, and being come into the North-Sea allready, and finding the Sea wide enough every where, and to bee about 30. or 40. leagues wyde in the Streight where hee entred: hee thought he had now well diſcharged his office, &amp; done the thing which he was ſent to doe: and that he not being armed, to reſiſt the force of the Saluage people that might happen to aſſault him, therefore hee ſet ſayle, and returned towards Noua Hiſpaniae,
                  
where he arrives at Aquapulco, Anno 1592. hoping to be well rewarded of the Viceroy for his voyage ſo performed.
               Alſo he ſaid, that he was greatly welcomed to Mexico by the Viceroy and had promiſe of great reward; but ſtaying there 2 yeares to his ſmall content, the Viceroy told him he ſhould be rewarded in Spaine of the King, and therefore willed him to repayre thither, which he did performe.
               At his comming thither he was greatly welcomed at the Kings Court in words, but after long ſuite he could not get any reward there to his content; and therefore at length he ſtole away and came into Italy, to get home to live amongſt his kindred in his owne country, he being now very old.
               Alſo he ſaid, that he thought that the cauſe of his ill reward was had of the Spaniards to be, for that they did underſtand very well that the Engliſh Nation had now given over all their voyages for the diſcovery of the N, W. paſſage, wherfore they feared not them any more to come that way into the S. Sea; and therefore they needed not his ſervice therein any more.
               Alſo he ſaid, that in regard of his ill reward had of the Spaniard; and underſtanding of the Noble mind of the Queene of England, and of her warres maintained ſo valiantly againſt the Spaniard, hoping her Matie, would do him Iuſtice for his goods loſt by Capt. Cavendiſh, he would be content to goe into England and ſerve her Matie. in that Voyage to diſcover the N, W. paſſage into the S Sea, and would put his life in her Maieſties hands to performe the ſame, if ſhee would furniſh him with one ſhip of 40 tonnes, and one Pinnace, and that hee would performe the ſame from the one end of the Straits to the other, and he willed me ſo to write into England.
               
               Whereupon after this twice conference I did write to the old Lord Treaſurer Cicil, and to Sir Walter Rawleigh, and to Mr. Richard Hackluit that famous Coſmographer, praying that 100 pounds might be ſent for the charge of ſending this Pylot into England, I received anſwer from ſome of my friend

            MY PREPARATIONS to the Voyage.
            
               GEntlemen, our Yorkeſhire Proverbe is, Plaine dealing is a Iewell; So it is, that I was neither importuned nor intreated to this vndertaking by any eyther Noble or Gentle, but the Truth is, that I had beene itching after it ever ſince 1606. when I ſhould have gone Mate to Iohn Knight, of whom doth follow, yet I muſt confeſſe that heere my ambition ſoared a pitch higher then my abilitie, as now time hath made me to know, yet his Diſcretion and Experience taught him to diſcerne of what could bee in my youth, but I preſuming vpon ſome parts I had, as the vſe of the Globes and other Mathematicke Inſtruments, (having beene Sea bred from my Boyestime, and had beene in the Mediterranian, Spaine, France, Holland, Norway, Denmarke, and the Balticke Sea,) thought my ſelfe to bee fit for the beſt imployment, deſired to be pluckt before I was ripe; but hee durſt not depend vpon me in that place for the Voyage, ſo as I did not proceed with him; yet I was ſtill kept in Marine imployments along the Coaſt and Croſsing the Sea, whereby I gained Experience, and alſo at the Returnes home of all Ships from thence, I enquired of the Maſters Mates and others that were that way imployed,

whereby I gathered by Report and Diſcourſe and Manuſcripts, how farre they had proceeded, what they had done, and what was to doe: To better which, I often repaired to Mr. IOHN TAPPE, whoſe acquaintance was much amongst theſe men, he alſo acquainting me with Mr. THO. STERNE Globe-maker, (whom I have found to have engroſſed all thoſe former Voyages by Relation, Manuſcripts; and Maps;) from whom I gathered much, and muſt needs ſay, hee is a very well deſerving Practitioner: So that I thought my ſelfe to be now ready for the ſame attempt, when occaſion ſhould preſent it ſelfe.
            Which fell out by former acquaintance I had with that famous Mathematician Mr. HENRY BRIGGES, who mooved me thereto and I willingly conſented, ſo as things could be brought to paſſe, the which to ſtrengthen himſelfe, hee acquainted that Hon: Knight Sir IOHN BROOKE, whom both to▪ doe their King ſervice, &amp; the Publike good, perſwades with divers of their friends to come into the Adventure.
            Whereupon, wee exhibited a Petition to his Maieſty for the lend of a Ship for the Voyage and countenance to the Action, who Graciouſly accepted and granted both; but the time of the yeare was ſo farre ſpent before wee could make our proviſion ready, as wee were forced to deſiſt vntill the yeare following: in which proceſſe Mr. BRIGGES deceaſed, and the one halfe of the Adventure fell away.
            In the meane time and before the next yeare, one Captaine IAMES of Briſtow, had ſo wrought with the Marchants of the ſayd Citie for to ſet forth one Ship for the ſame deſigne, as they were willing to adventure ſo as they might ſhare with London, in equall honour and profit, whether Ship ſoever found the ſame, and this as was ſignified in a Letter from Captaine IAMES to Mr. BRIGGES, which Letter I did ſee is he ſhowed the ſame to Sir IOHN BROOKE, they both conſenting to write backe againe vnto him that the Requeſt was

condeſcended vnto, of which and for better aſſurance, Capt. IAMES ridde from Briſtow to Oxford before the death of Mr. BRIGGES deſiring, that ſeeing we were both to goe forth in one yeare that hee might goe in the higher place, but was denyed.
            In this interim came home that Honourable Knight Sir THOMAS ROE from his Ambaſſage to the King of Sweden, who being made acquainted with the Deſigne, gave it his beſt furtherance, when his Maieſty ſending for this voyages never failing friend Sir IOHN WOLSTENHOLM the elder Knight, appointing them two to expediate forward the enterprize. Commanding the Maſter and Wardens of the Trinity-Houſe to be aſſiſting hereunto; and young Sir Iohn Wolſtenholme, that now is, was appointed Treaſurer.
            The Ship of his Maieſties, was (of my owne chuſing, and the beſt for condition and quality, eſpecially for this voyage that the world could afford) of Burthen 80. Tonnes, the number of men 20. and 2. boyes, and by all our Cares was ſheathed, Cordaged, Builded and repaired; all things being made exactly ready againſt an appointed time.
            My greateſt care was to have my men of Godly converſation, and ſuch, as their yeares of time not exceeding 35. had gained good Experience, that I might thereby be the better aſſiſted, eſpecially by ſuch as had been vpon thoſe Froſt biting voyages by which they were hardned for indurance, and could not ſo ſoone be diſmayed at the ſight of the Ice. For beardleſſe younkers, I knew as many as could man the Boate was enough; and for all our dependances was vpon GOD alone, for I had neither private end, ambition, or vaine glory.
            And all theſe things I had contractedly done by the Maſter, Wardens and Aſſiſtants of the Trinity-Houſe. For a Lieutenant I had no vſe, but it grieved me much that I could not get one man that had bin on the ſame voyage before, by whoſe counſaile or diſcourſe I might better have ſhunned the Ice.
            
               I was Victualed compleatly for 18 Moneths, 
                  •
               at whether the Baker, Brewer, Butcher, and other, were Mr. of their Arts or profeſſionsor no I know not, but this I am ſure of, I had excellent fat Beefe, ſtrong Beere, good wheaten Bread, good Iſeland Ling, Butter and Cheeſe of the beſt, admirable Sacke and Aqua-vita, Peaſe, Oat-meale, Wheat-meale, Oyle, Spice, Suger, Fruit and Rice; with Chyrurgerie, as Sirrups, lulips, condits, tre
                  •
               hiſsis, antidotes, balſoms, gummes, vnguents, implaiſters, oyles, potions, ſuppoſitors, and purging Pils, and if I had wanted Inſtruments my Chyrurgion had enough.
            My Carpenter was fitted from the thickeſt bolt to the pumpe-nayle or tacket.
            The Gunner from the Sacor to the Piſtoll.
            The Boatſwaine from the Cable to the Sayle-twine.

            And for Bookes, if I wanted any. I was too blame being bountifully furniſht from the Treaſurer with money to provide me, eſpecially for thoſe of ſtudy there would be no leiſure nor was there, for I found worke enough; and if the matter it ſelfe had not been in another place when ſodaine occaſion was preſent, it had bin too late for me (like the Holland Skipper to runne to his Cheſt) to looke vpon his Waggoner booke. But thoſe things I feare, you will ſay they are needleſſe (yet give me leave to follow the faſhion) and good for nothing, but to make Courtiers and Schollers marvell at my curioſitie, and thinke ſtrange that there ſhould be ſo much adoe about making a Ship take the Sea.

                     Da 11 this laſt was the coldeſt night that I felt ſince I came into this melancholly path, and wee had fewer Seafowle than before, we had no ground at 320 fathome, the wind came to the Northeaſt.

From hence, I haled up in N, W. by N. for ſight of Deſolation.
               
               This day was faire cloſe weather, with diſperſing fogges.
                     Da 15 which I doe perceive, to be incident, to thoſe Seas, Poles elevation was 58 d. 50 min. the Sea is here almoſt continually ſmooth, the water blacke, but not ſo thicke as is formerly writ of, and ſmall ſtore of fowle to be ſeene.
               This day and laſt night hath been thicke weather, but ſo as 
                     Da 16 we might diſcerne 3 miles betwixt one Fog-drift &amp; another, I had ſteered ſome Watches W, and by N. which for ſome reaſon

of a reported Current, I altered to the N, W. by N. againe, although after the variation thwart Cape Farewell was found (and allowed) in my running over betwixt the ſame, and the Weſt Maine, or the Weſt ſide of Fretum Hudſon, I found my reckoning to agree without any interruption, furtherance or hinderance of Current; therefore what inſtruction ſhall as yet be laid down in this way without good judgement, in the practitioner and libertie withall, is but as it were to teach a blind man to ſee by demonſtration.

maine, whereon ſtood two high hills, bearing Northweſt covered with ſnow, the Bay was full of maſh'd Ice, which it ſeemed the S, E. wind had inforced herein, by dead reckoning I was at that inſtant in 62 d. 17 m. where preſently haveing a good obſervatiō, at that inſtant I was in 62 d. 25. m. the difference being but 8 m. &amp; that to the W. ward, it doth not ſhew that there is any current continually, to ſet out of Fretum Davis to the S. as is generally reported, for from the lat. 58 d. 30 m. croſſing Fretum Davis 220 leag. or therabouts to the W ſide in 62 d. 27 m. and having but 8 min. difference betwixt dead reckoning, and the obſervation, and that to the Northward, whether, doth there any current appeare to come from the N. out of Fretum Davis or no.
               Having thus met with the land I ſtood to the Southward untill midnight, with the waide at W. hopeing to ply up into the paſſage.

               A Diſcourſe for the ſame.
               Setting forth and beginning my accompts from the W. moſt place of Orkney I made 2 obſervations for the variation of the compaſſe, evenin Amplit. the one was 8 d. the other 4 d. but IThicke Horizon. do give no certain credit therunto, yet I do rather truſt to that of 8 d. at which inſtant, I did account I was 24 deg. or thereabout, Eaſtward of the great Meridian, and neere the parralell of 60 deg. continuing the courſe W. ward as wind would ſerve, untill I came into the Latit. of 58 deg. 12 min. I was then 12 deg. or thereabouts, from the place of my departure, and traverſing with contrary windes, betwixt the latit. of 59 deg. 12 min. and 60 deg. 20 min. at 18 d. ½. diſtance from my ſetting forth, I continued the courſe ſtill Weſtward, with ſo ſmall difference, betwixt my obſervation and protraction, or traverſe, as I thought I might as well truſt to the one, as the other. Continuing this courſe in the latit. of 60 deg. 19 m. W.N

                     ta. from the firſt Meridian 6 deg. I found by my obſervation that I was to S. ward 5 m of my protracted courſe, and though then I did perceive, that the Compaſſe was varied Weſtward, yet how much for want of Amplitude, or celeſtiall obſervation, could not be knowne.
               Now the wind comming freely on, and, taking Mr. Hals account. That Cape Farewell in Groyneland, which land firſt I did deſire to fall with (though I did not much regard) lyeth 18 d.

And although there is no certainty of agreement amongſt ſome of my predeceſſours, concerning the variation there, ſome writing 11 d. others 14 d. confuſedly, yet I did hope that courſe would have brought mee at leaſt to ſight thereof, report making it to be high and Mountainous land, (not withſtanding Variation or current) eſpecially having ſo franke a gale of wind, and but 12 d. of a ſmall circle neere the 60 paralell, the diſtance being but 120 leag. at moſt, and in that diſtance holding the ſame courſe, I had 2 deg. 14 min. to wracke upon, and within one point at moſt of my paralell; and neerer with a ſti

I know no other cauſe for this but the large diſtance betwixt Nova Zembla on the E. and Groenland, in which the Ocean may take opportunity, to uſe his naturall agitation from E, to W. being thereunto drawne by the reſtleſſe motion and impulſion of the Heavens, and here butting upon Groenland, muſt of neceſſity (the land lying ſomewhat neere his naturall inclination) trend along there, ſetting his current to the S, W. or elſe, as in a huge Bay, make a Repercuſſive motion (as in the Bay of Mexico) by entring in at the S. ſide, and wheeling about by the bottome, muſt revert back againe along the North ſide by Cape Florida.

               And thus much further I am of opinion, if Sir Martin Frobriſher▪

                  I did here reckon of 24 deg. variation, but ſailed all by Meridian compaſſe and have wrote this Iournall there after, therefore the allowance is to be accounted, as the places doe differ in variation.

                   it blew in both topſailes, but towards night the wind leſſened, and I could perceive the ice betwixt me, and the Cape, to drive to Seaward, of which neere the ſhoare, was great ſtore.
               The flood comming on, I cauſed both Topſayles to bee caſt over, and wee threed it, betweene Ice and Ice, with a well bent flood inwards, ſo as that we had got above the Ile (that tyde) if this faire day had not ended in fogge. A motion was made before this, to looke for harbour, but that I denied, for thoſe reaſons given, that I did not know, what danger might fall me, if I had put into the ſhore, where lay much yce (as we could ſee) and what yce or ſunke Rocks might be in the way, I was as ignorant of; beſides not knowing whether the wind would ſerve to bring me in a ſafe roade, and how the Tyde might ſet to turne or ſayle in, as occaſion might fall out, but the worſt was and that was moſt I feared, the wind might Souther, and then there being ſuch ſtore of yce in the paſſage, would inforce all the harbours full, and ſo might cut my cable, and put me on ſhore upon the Rockes, it flowing much water there, as Baſſin reports, with theſe

               This miſty morning, made the Sunne clime 10 degrees in 
                     Da 23 height, before he could peepe through the ſame, which afterwards prooved a very faire calme hot day, making both Ice and Pitch runne, but the ſhip was incloſed, amongſt the Ice driving with ebbe and flood, about 2. leagues from the South end of Reſolution, I had no ground at 180 fathomes, ſome of my men ſaid they ſaw ſmoake on land, and after it prooved true, for Captaine James was in harbour there all that ſame time, my Maſter went with boate and kild 9, willicks, whereof he kindly beſtowed upon every

Meſſe one (they make ſtrong and good pottage.

                     Moneths June. demanded why I made ſuch haſte, anſwered, that as every Mountaine conſiſted of ſeverall peeces, ſo did my Voyage upon Fathomes, which muſt be meaſured here with ſpeed, though afterward I might take leiſure, which added one to another, might in time compaſſe all the Mountaines of the world, and that it fared with me, as with the Mackarell-men at London, who muſt haſten to Market before the fiſh ſtinke.
               This evening the Sun ſet cleare, the Ayre breathed gently from the Eaſt, and we lay quietly all night amongſt the Ice.
               This morning the wind began to gather ſtrength, from the 
                     Da 24 E, S, E. the flood came on, and the Ice began to ſeparate; I cauſed one peece to be made faſt unto the ſhip, with 2. Grapnels, to the intent to towe it at the ſhips ſterne, mooring the ſhip ſo thereunto, that ſhe might make way N, W. for the North ſhore, for that it hath been alwayes ſaid, that the North ſide was cleereſt from Ice; thus made faſt, although the wind forſt on the ſhip, yet her way was ſo eaſie, as ſhe could take no harme, if ſhe had touched upon the ſame, becauſe this trayle or drag ſtayed her way; but the wind blowing on, the ſhip broke one Grapnet off by the Arme of the flooke, and bended the other, ſo as we were looſe from thence; but meeting great ſtore of driving Ice, I cauſed to make faſt againe for ſafety, where we were preſently incloſed for many miles.
               This morning, the ſhip broke looſe from that peece, I was 
                     Da 25 made faſt unto, the ſhip and tackling being more in the winds power then the Ice, (it being lower) cauſed her to drive faſter.
               I cauſed the Spritſaile to be looſed, to binde the ſhips Stem to the Ice, which gave alwayes way with the flood, which ſet Weſtward; So the Eaſt wind forcing it backe, made it cloze with the ebbe, returning Eaſtwards, which put mee in good hope, that further within the ſtraight, I ſhould finde all cleare, or at leaſt the Ice ſo thinne, as I might paſſe betweene one and another, and with this perſwaſion I drew on the Company, that the S, E. winds which had blown for 6 or 7 dayes before we came into this Freet, had kept in

this Ice, and thoſe Weſt winds, which had blowne 3 dayes before, and at our entry, comming (from about 140 leagues)
                     Moneths Iune from the bottome heere, in ſome places 20, in ſome places 30, and in ſome 40 leagues more, or leſſe broad, had packt all from thence, unto this ſtraitened place, betwixt Cape Chidley, and the body of Reſolution, and ſo choaked this entrance, being not above 14 leagues broad, the wind E, N, E. we drive all this time inwards with the ice.
               Now this prodigious thing we call Ice, is of two ſorts, asQuantity and ſhapes of Ice. mountainous ice wch is a huge peece compact, of a great quantity, ſome of more, ſome of leſſe; but in this Freet, you ſeldome have any bigger then agreat Church, and the moſt therof leſſe, being of ſeverall formes, as ſome 20, ſome 30, ſome 40 yards above the ſuperficies of the water, but farre more under, of theſe you may tell ſometimes 7 or eight in ſight, ſo that they are no hindrance to us.
               The other is ſmaller, and that we call maſht or fleackt ice: of this you ſhall there have numbers infinite, ſome of the quantity of a Rood, ſome a Pearch,

                   an acre, ſome 2 acres, but the moſt is ſmall and about a foot or 2, or more above the water, and 8 or 10, or more under the water, and thoſe are they which doe incloſe you; So as in much wind from the topmaſt head, you ſhall hardly ſee any water for them, but whilſt you lie amongſt them, it is ſo ſmooth as you ſhall not feele the ſhip ſtirre, onely if it be much wind, make the ſhip ſnogge, and at returne of the Tydes, when the ice doth loozen, have all care to the Rudder: at ſhift of wind the ice will make way one from another, in the meane time have patience, and in trailing of ice on ſterne, if the ſhip doe touch but againſt itTracing of Ice. with the ſtemme, ſo as the ſtroke ſodainely ſtay her way, then have care to keep the helme in midſhips, for your traile with its way, will come preſently againſt the backe, of the Rudder, and it lying on either ſide, is in danger to breake, or ſet it on wry.
               There is another way which is to muzzell the ſhip, with a peece of ice cloſe to his ſtem and bowes the ice, being ſo ſwifted, the ſhip is to drive it, with head ſaile, but this I doe not cōmend, for that the ſhip not having freſh way, ſhall not have her ſteering beſide the edy water, the forſt ice ſhall make, not comming quicke to the Rudder, it ſhall not command her, ſo

as if any wind be, ſhee ſhall caſt a thwart with head to the wind, and drive ſterne wayes to the great danger of her Rudder

               This day hath been wet fog, unto evening 6. then it cleered,
                     Da 25 at 10 we ſee land to the N. not certaine whether Reſolution, or no, for there was no remarkeable thing thereon, this Evening Sun kiſt Th

               At the beginning of flood, here is wheeling ſtreames like edie tides, I take to be cauſed by the ice themſelves, one drawing more water then another, and continueth all the time of their moving, untill they be ſetled, ſo as it may be conjectured that it doth runne ½ tyde under other, as in moſt places elſewhere all this time, ſince the wind came E. ward, it hath not blowne above courſe, and bonnet Gale.
               This morning the Sun roſe cleare, and ſo continued all this 
                     Da 26 cold Virgin day, for I have not ſeene one cloud to interpoſe, yet he went peeping through a cloud to bed, and now the froſt takes care that there ſhall no more pitch runne from off the Sun ſide of the ſhip, and the land towards Sun-ſet, doth ſo altar by the exhalation of vapours, that it ſhewes now firme land, then a Bay, now high, then low, that we cannot ſay whether we make maine-land, Bayes or through-lets, the ice with the uncertain reflex of the Sun, made ſuch unconſtant ſhapes.
               This morning the Sun ſhewed himſelfe, through Fly-land,

Main, I cauſed to make looſe, whence we furtherd ½ a mile, the wind comming W. with fog cauſed us to make faſt againe, God thinke upon our impriſonment, with a ſupercedias, this evening Sun dog, I hope may bring ſome change to our good.
               This overcaſt day proved faire, and a pretty W, N, W. gale, untill towards night, my Carpenter made ſtraight a peece, above the backe of our Rudder, which was ſet awry with the ice, I cauſed the lead to be caſt in 320 fathomes, but the underebbe-tide did carry it ſo far to the E. as wee could not thinke

wee had leſſe ſtray then 30 fat homes, the ground was ſmall blacke ſand, with long crooked things the length of a needle,

               This hot day is alſo at an end, I have had an Ayre of wind,
                     Da 30 with all ſayle on board, and threading betwixt the Ice, got about 4 miles N, W. wards, and ſtucke faſt againe, by the way, I came by one peece of Ice, ſomething higher then the reſt; whereupon a ſtone was of the Contents of 5 or 6 Tonne weight, with divers other ſmaller ſtones, and mudde thereon. It ſee meth to condeſcend with reaſon, that theſe peeces of ice are ingendred upon the Winters ſnow, which falling in drifts by the forcing &amp; wheeling of the wind, condenſing and compacting a great quantity together, over the ſteepe brow ofCompacting of Ice. ſome high mountaine, cleaving thereto untill diſſolving time of the yeare, when the earth receives her naturall warmneſſe then inforced by their weight to tumble into the Sea, carrying with them all ſuch trees or ſtones as they have formerly incloſed; God be thanked, the Ice begun to thinne, and ſeparate, this hot weather doth faſt diſſolve them.
               This night, clocke 2, came a ſmall Iland of Ice, brought up with the latter flood, and by his draught being deeper in the Tydes way then the flact or maſht Ice, had a greater motion continued by the undertyde, then that which had incloſed us, of which we were faſt unto one, of the biggeſt, content to wit, 3 Acres; this Iland did drive right with us, and but that ſome few maſht Ice interpoſed, thereby diverting the courſe thereof, ſome 2 or 3 ſhips length it had drove directly upon us, and had cruſht us mainely, if not to peeces, it being 
                     •
                   or 10 fathomes above water; and if it had boarded us, being undermined by the waters continuall working, the outſide thereof by that ſhake might have fallen into the ſhip, and have ſunke her; this was the greateſt danger we were in, ſince I came into

                  Fretum Hudſon, the fault being in the watch, who did not call, that we might have ſet the ſhip the one way or the other, about the peece we were faſt unto, before we were ſo ingaged, as I could doe neither; about one houre after, the ſaid Iland tooke his recourſe backe againe to the Eaſt, with the ebbe faſter then the other ice could doe.
               This morning 8, the Sunne was up, before we ſaw it,

Maine) and longer as ſhall be ſhowne at my returne homeward, the tyde doth ſet as the land doth lie, South-Eaſt, and Northweſt.
               This night 7, it was an Ayre, farre better then a younger brother, the ice well thinn'd, I cauſed the ſhip to be looſed, and by that time the Maſter with the boat was come from killing of Fowle, I ſtood to the N. about foure miles, this fayre day being at an end, I made faſt, ſet the watch and went to Cabbin.
               This morning 2, an eaſie gale breathed from the E. by South which cauſed mee to ſend to the boatſwaine to call up the Company where a chiefe one amongſt us, being too ſuddenly awaked, ſpeaking ſomething peeviſhly, I told the reſt that the matter was not great, for the children did ſo when they were awaked out of their ſleep; I began now to find the want of a Shallop, which at home I did ſo earneſtly deſire, for my Cocke boat would nor Rowe no

Whereon the Snow falling by degrees, doth preſſe

We are now cleere of chattered Ice, yet (in ſight) are ſome Iſlands, about which wee can compaſſe as we pleaſe; here lyeth many ſmall Ilands cloſe by the Mayne, and there doth appeare to be fayre ſounds into the land, upon the Sea this calme time that hath beene, doth ſwimme a kind of corrupt ſlime, one may thinke it may come by generation of great fiſhes, for it feeles ſoft and unctious, but put it into the fire it will not burne.
               I doe thinke that all this time of our impriſonment, this North ſhore hath beene free, as I could eſpie it at Hiperions going downe, which valed with a blacke Skreene of moyſt Fogge, wet through our Coates before we ſee it againe, this fayre dayes Weſtwind blew cold and uncouth from out the paſſage, wee are all upon kinde tearmes, drinking one to another, God hold it.
               This morning the Sunne lickt up the Fogges dew, as ſoone 
                     Da 3 as hee began to riſe, and made a ſhining day of it, I cannot ſay hot, it being counter-checkt by a coole Top-ſayle Gale, from Weſt, North-Weſt, which made our Noſes runne, the cleare day emboldened me to ſtand within two leagues of land to the deepe of 32 fathomes, the ground white ſand and gray with ſhels, the water was falling, the houre 11 before noone, the Sunne and Moone in oppoſition, a good Tyde ſet along the ſhoare to the Northwards the Sunne ſet cleare, it was faire weathen and calme, the ſhip drove along the ſhore this night to the Weſtward.
               This morning at clocke one, I called to lanche the Boate, to ſend to ſhore, to try the Tyde, and againſt that time that I could ſend to land, I had drawne thoſe inſtructions following, and giving them to Iohn Coateſworth, whom I appointed alway to goe in the boate, at whoſe returne I expected an account.
            
            
               Theſe are the Inſtructions.
               Firſt, You ſhall take with you into the boate, one halfe

houre glaſſe one halfe minute glaſſe, one logge and line, cleane Paper, one Penſill of blacke Leade, and one Compaſſe, with 
                     Moneths July. ſome peeces of Iron.Take in the boat with you.
               
               Secondly, One quarter Saw, two Axes, three Carbins Guns with Powder and Shot, two or three Lances, two Swords, two Pikeaxes and every man his one day bread.
               Thirdly, At your departure from the ſhip, turne the halfe houre, and when it is neere out, ſet your Logge to goe by the halfe minute, that thereby you may eſtimate the diſtance betweene the ſhip and land, as alſo what the boate can rowe an houre.
               Fourthly, When you ſhall approch neere the ſhore in the Tydes way, I meane cleare of Bay-point, or Rocke, Anchor the Boat, ſound the deepe, and marke the Tyde how it doth ſet, and by your Logge what it doth paſſe in the halfe minute, having rode there for halfe a Glaſſe, weigh your Anchor, and goe to land, and duely obſerve, what quantity of water it doth flow, or fall perpendiculer, in one Glaſſe, whether the heightening, or leſſening be equall in every Glaſſe, while yee ſtay or noe.
               Fifthly, Being thus on land with your Compaſſe, ſet all Lands or Iſlands in ſight, draw the forme with your Paper and Penſill, and eſtimate their diſtance.
               Sixtly, Remember I give you no libertie to goe within the land, yet if for recreation goe no further then the full Sea marke, and armed, leaving two to keepe the Glaſſe and Boat, looke for ſtones of Orient colour, or of weight, Seamors teeth, Vnicornes horne, or Whale Finne, Plants, Herbes, or any thing, Spungy fleet out of the Sea, if you finde Scurvie graſſe, Orpin, or Sorrill, bring them all on board to me.
               Seventhly, If you will goe above the full Sea marke, looke for ſcoting of wilde Beaſts; by that, or their dung, you may imagine what they are, if Deere doe not chaſe them into the land, for feare of being betrayed, for the people in thoſe parts, are all treacherous, how faire ſoever they intreat you, remember alſo that the loſſe of you or the boate, is the utter overthrow of the whole Voyage.
               Eightly, If you finde of their Tents, and they fled, doe no harme to any of their buildings, but bring with you the moſt

things of marke, leaving in the ſame place, a peece of Iron,
                     Moneths Iuly. bigger or leſſer, as you eſtimate the ſame to be of worth unto us; and ſo neare as you can chuſe, a beach or ſandy Bay to land in, for there you ſhall eſpie moſt likelihood of Inhabitants.
               Ninthly, leave one Carbine, one Lance, and one ſhort Sword, to defend the boat, with whoſe (tow) keepers, you ſhall give charge, that if either they ſhall eſpie any token from the ſhip, as ſtriking the maine Topſaile, Miſon, and Spritſaile, Gunſhot, or Fireſmoke, or be aſſaulted by any the Inhabitants, that then they ſhall diſcharge the ſaid Carbine. To the firſt intent, that you repaire with ſpeed on board; to the ſecond for their reſcue, and your own ſaftie; when you come cleerein the tydes way, try it as before in the 4 article; the reſt is referred to your own diſcretion, &amp; ſo I pray God for your ſafe returne.
               This morning at clocke 6. the wind came faire, the weather 
                     Da 4 like to be thicke and raine, I beckoned them to come on board, but they ſaw me not; at their departing the dawning being cleare the Ayre calme, and it was within an houre of Sun-riſing, the Sea ſmooth, the ſhip nearer the ſhoare then at any time before, ſince we came into the paſſage, and the whole day towards; I would not looſe this opportunity to ſend to land the boat, after 5 houres they returned, and gave account that it was flood-tide about clocke 5. and that they thinke it flowed halfe an houre, the land lay N, N, W. in this time with the ſhip, we drive by an Iland of Ice a ground in 50 fathome,Salvage Tents. they found where people had been of old, their Tent walls, were of ſtones laid one upon another, &amp; ſquare built, found one knife haft, three ſeverall ſorts of herbes, but my Chirurgion knew not what they were; one peece of drift wood, they found the dung and footing of Deere (lately made) and if they may be beleeved, they affirme that in ¼ of an houre, it did flow above 4 foot water, and that it had above 5 fathomes upright to flow to the full Sea marke, which they could eaſily perceive by the beach, they being forced to rowe and ſaile 4 miles before they could come to a place to land at, this E, S, E. wind blew on with ſtiffe gale and durt, at noone it fell thicke raine, and continued untill 4 next day morning, in which time wee made way neare 30 leagues in cleare Sea, and then had like to have beene imbayed, which Ices lyeth thick off Prince Henries

               This morning the Sun was vailed with driſling raine, I ſtood

This evening the Sunne ſet with a weather gall oppoſite, and Zephyrus blewe on a pretty gale, at the ſame inſtant the lead was wet in 150. fathomes, the line having 20. fath. ſtraie to the E. and I thought the Tyde ſet W. the moſt of this day I ſtood away N, W. but was glad ſometime to alter courſe, to the N. for Ice, for the S. land lay all full, this day hath bin very hot. Before this S. wind came

               The Sunne did riſe cleare, at clocke 8 came on a Fogge, and 
                     Da 7 continued unto one, wee had ſtore of ice to the S. off us, then it cleared and we were come to the Weſtward amongſt much ice, and had ſight of a high Iland, bearing W. about 6 or 7. leag. off, wee ſaw alſo the high land, of the N. maine, 12 leag. off. The Sun ſet valed, and we had no ground at 150 fath. it fell to raine, and I tooke in both topſailes, and ſtood to and againe among the Ice.
               This morning was cold with ſome ſnow, and the W. wind 
                     Da 8 blew hard, we made the ſhip faſt, to a great peece of yce, which ſhe plowed through the reſt, by force of the Gale, although we had made her as ſnug as we could, at Noone we were in 63Latit. 63 de 40 min. deg. 31 min. now the wind calmed, and I made looſe, and

               This mornings Sun raiſe cleare, and I ſtood to the N cloſe

Channell, muſt needs ſtraiten all the ice that fleets from the N, W. yet for the good of the Voyage, it was fit to try all concluſions, but thus ſtriving to the W. we were preſently incloſed againe where we lay vntill the next morning all too nere the Iland, if I could have got further off. This night had a ſtiffe gale at Weſt with one ſhowre of raine, the Sunne was obſcured 2 howres before night, and wee ſlept ſafe in our old Innes.

               All this day the fog banks hath deceived mee, but now I am ſure I ſee land, both the maine and Ilands, of which there are many, lying about 2 leagues into the Sea, all ragged and broken rocks within this land bore from N. E. by E. to W. by S. here are great ſtore of fiſh leaping, and fairer weather cannot be; I have ſent the boat to land, and to my comfort three things I could eſpie by the ſhore; that it was flood Tyde, and that it came from the Southward, and that it doth flow and fall very much water, before we came neere the Iland, wee came over a banke of 8 fathomes, and neerer the Iland we fell into 15. there ſeeming upon the land to be Poles erected, and buildings of ſtone, and other hillocks like Haycocks.
               The boat went on land at clocke 6. and ſtayed 3 glaſſes or one houre, and ½, in which time it flowed neere ſixe foot, it was flood before they went, for while they were rowing to ſhore, I did obſerve it had flowed at leaſt 3 foot, by certain rocks that were dry at our firſt approach, they ſay that it had about 9 foot to flow; at clocke 8. the tide returned, and ſet to S.

               Our men found ſtinking oyle in a fiſh gut, and ſome ſmall Whale Finnes; this Iland I named Sir Thomas Rowes Welcome; I ſtood off into 33 fathomes that night, untill clocke 2, the wind Weſt, for I was directed by the letter of my inſtruction, to ſet the courſe from Carie Swannes Neſt, N, W, by N.

               This Noble Knight graced me in the delivering of my Petition to his Majeſtie, and afterwards brought me to his Royall Preſence, there to ſhew the hopefull poſſibility of the attempt.

And after this perſiſting in his kindneſſe, invited mee to his owne Table, where I had my dyet, continually aſſiſting

               Now for this Iland it is all of a white Marble, of indifferent height, with many water Ponds therein, and great ſtore of Fowle, eſpecially water fowle, they brought on board two goodly Swannes, and a young Tall Fowle alive, it was long headed, long neckt, and a body almoſt anſwerable; for it was but pen-feathered, I could not diſcerne whether it was an Eſtridge or no, within 3 or 4 dayes the legges by miſchance were broken, and it dyed.

flowings of water incredible to be beleeved, in reſpect of other places, for it may be perceived, that the water hath

               Being ſatisfied for what concerned this place, I weyed and ſtood to Sea in ſixe fathomes the leaſt water, fearing to deale any more within the Ilands, when I was cleare, I went to the old courſe againe S. W. by S. but the land flying me, I hal'd in Weſt, and had water from 14 to 6 fathome, uneven ground, the land met me againe, ſtretching more to S. and had many humlocks therein; I ſtood toward it W. and W. S. W. ſo neere as I durſt for ſhoale water, at which time I dare preſume it was ſeven miles from me, and yet I had but 6, 7, or 10 fathome: I runne off along time before I came into 20 fathome, and in this wearing off I came by two dry ridges that had been farre without me; I Anchored at night in 25 fathomes 10 leagues S. S. W. from the land and Ilands, which I roade amongſt laſt night, the Tyde came S. S. W.
               This faire morning, I waited at clocke 6. and ſtood along 
                     Da 2 Weſt Southweſt, having 25, 25, 25, fathomes at the diſtance of 7 leagues from my laſt nights Anchoring place, I met another Iland &amp; three or foure more within it, all lying almoſt without ſight of the Maine, I ſtood within them to ſeven fathomes, and tooke about to make a perfect diſcovery of the Maine, which done, I Veered away, the wind ſtill about North North Weſt, I went to Seaward off the ſaid Iland, at whoſe Northeaſt end, there lay a reefe, which with the ebbe that fell over it, made a great Ripling or Race, ſo as I could diſcerne thereby when I might edge up againe; here in this Overfall was a Sea Mors, I tooke this to be the Checkes; latitudeLatitude 61. d. 10. m. 61 degrees, 10 minutes, I went over in nine fathomes, and then ſtanding Southweſt, came preſently into twentie, I hoped now for a ſight of Hubberts comfortable Hope, the land lay along Southweſt and Northeaſt, it hath blowen all this day to Courſe and Bonnet, at night I Anchored at twenty fathomes, two or three leagues from ſhore, the land is low, but within are many water ponds, and ſmall growne wood.

The Latit. w is 60 d. 22 m. this afternoone was ſmall wind from S, W. and I ſent the boat to the land, being about 3 miles off, my ſelfe with ſhip anchored in 7 fathomes, I gave a token that if the water ſhould ſhoale ſodainely, they in the boate ſhould ſhoote off a Musket, which before they came to ſhoare they did, here were many Musketoes.
               The Maſter was in the boate, and had but 2 fathomes when they ſhot; all the water within us was ſhoald, ſo that then we were glad to wade forth, although the tyde was flood, it flowing 14 inches in two glaſſes, but in further examining I found no good account, onely this doth ſuſtice, that as I range along the coaſt I do goe from the tide, and that it keepeth courſe, with the Moone, and that the further I ſpeed from Sir Thomas Roes welcome, it ſtill floweth leſſe water, and the tides current is the eaſier; here on land the Mr. found, the reliques of a birch Cannowe, the footings and hornes of Deere, both ſmall and great, and of fowle, an Arrowe headed with a nayle, the head beaten broad, and put into a ſhaft of 18 inches long, he thought it flowed about 7 foote, the floode began about clocke 8. I am ſure it was ſlacke tyde at ſhip then and I will be ſlacke to write any more hereof, for I cannot ſeaſon the reckoning taken on ſhoare.
               After the boates comming on board, I ſtood off 3 glaſſes, to anchor in 13 fathome water (Hubbert makes me hope) for now I draw nere, here the tyde did ſet S, W. and by W. the ebbe E, and by South.

               The Iland I was upon yeſterday was doubtleſſe the Checks named by Sir Thomas Button, for what reaſon I know not, except for that here his hope was croſt, he tooke it as a checke.

This river is on both ſides full of ſmall woods, the North ſide is a clay cliffe, like of that to the Naſe in Eſſex, but not ſo high; the ſhip being moored I went on land, and found the Nallie very convenient to ſet up a Tent and to build the Pinnace in, and here wee found ſome ſtore of Hogsheads, and Pipeſtanes, which had beene yron bound, one Maine top, a top gallant Maſt, diverſe blocks, and the ſides of ſtared cheſts, with divers reliques of ſome Engliſh Veſſell, which I tooke to have periſhed, or beene left not farre from hence; and indeed I did aſſure my ſelfe, it muſt be that of Sir Thomas Buttons, but as yet I have not found a tree will make a Mayne yard.

                     Da 14 the afternoone our men walked abroad to recreate themſelves, and looke out for freſh releife, this night did the Ship fleete off, and wee moord her againe, in 3 fathomes, at lowe water.

This day the Pinnace was brought on boord, God grant that with her helpe my hopes, may be accompliſhed, which heretofore hath been dangerous.

                  This peice of board I brought away, for I was underſaile, when the Pinnace came on board, ſo as I could not goe on

               This ebbe I came to Seawards, but for feare of ſhoale-water, I Anchored in 4 fathome, having little wind to chaſe the ſhip, and a ſtrong ebbe, feare call'd what I had obſerved at my in comming into my remembrance, ſo as I durſt hazzard no farther whiles flood came; and now I muſt adde one word or two, to what is before, concerning this dangerous river, which I would be loath to ſeek in thick weather, of either ſide the S. is beſt, but is flat a great way off, and Rockie ground, the beſt of the deepe is ⅔ Channell to S. there is 12 fathomes in the entrance; in one place, wee chafed our Cables ſore againſt the ſtones, of wch you might ſee 4 or 5 drie in the river, at once the laſt quarter ebbe come ſwifteſt, &amp; in Springtydes it flowed 3 foot before the tyde ſet up; the tyde returned to the Sea, at a full Sea on ſhore. The Sun and Moone didIt floweth S. E. Moone both ſet cleare this night; In this River wee got no reliefe but one Duck, heere a N. W. Moone maketh a full Sea.
               I wayed againe about halfe flood, and ſtood to Sea from 6. fathomes to 10. and Anchored in high water in 9 fathomes cleare ground, making ready to ply or ſayle the next flood, for now I am to diſcover to the Eaſt, betweene this and Maſter Hudſon his Weſt Bay, of which I muſt onely, making a journall, their being nothing elſe of note.

I was well entertained and feaſted by Captaine Iames, with varietie of ſuch cheere as his Sea prouiſions could aford, with ſome Partridges, wee dined betwixt decks, for the great cabin was not bigg enough to receiue our ſelues and followers; during which time the ſhip butt in 2 Courſes, and maine bonnet, threw in ſo much water, as wee could not haue wanted ſauſe, if wee had had roaſt Mutton.

heere was thicke Riuer-water, and ſmall drift wood, ſuch as vſually driue out of Riuers, without whoſe monthes lie alwayes 
                     Moneths Auguſt. ſhelues, barres, or ridges; I did now account I was about 105. leagues E, S, E. on this ſide Port Nelſon.
               
               This day being thwart the land, I ſawe yeſterday when I ſuppoſed it: the W. point of ſome River, or elſe the winding of the land to S. wards, and could ſee no land to the E. of the ſame. I made motion at dinner, for the N. W. (to the Maſter and his mate) declaring that now all this vndiſcovered land, betwixt M. Hudſons &amp; Sr. Thomas Buttons, was now perfectly finiſhed by vs; for that the land now trenting from this Cap, S. ward, muſt aſſuredly bee the cheeke of Mr. Hudſon his Weſtbay, as may appeare by thoſe Maps, brought whome by Bylot, after he was expoſed, and now the further ſearch of a paſſage, this way was hopeleſſe, and their needed no more ſearch, in all the ſide of this Bay. From 64. deg. 30 m. circularly to 55. deg. 10 m. and ſeeing that we could not attempt the N. W. from Notinghams Ile (as I was inſtructed) for the heavie quantitys of Ice, which had choaked all the 3. channels; at our entering in the midle of Iuly, now I did hope were diſolved, or els never, and it was beſt to make tryall thereof, whileſt this good wind laſted, and withall charged them with their promiſe made, at my parting from Notinghams, which was to haue ſeene a tryall before their going home, at what danger ſoever, (though then there was no attempting) if no paſſage proves elſe-weere, and to this ſame purpoſe, did wiſh mee to write what I would, and they would ſet their hands thervnto, which for ſome concealed reaſon I did manifeſt, ſhewing them alſo that we had long time to ſpend, for Mr. Hudſon did not harbour vntill the firſt of November, and for S. Thomas Button hee 
                     Da 2 was conſtrained: and that I was not to obſerue any precedent of that nature, for I was not come to ſee what my predeceſſors had done, but to doe more; either finde the Paſſage, or bring home a good account, which I could not doo, if I did not ſpeed my Commiſsionith what haſt I could, and for harbouring there was none vntill the mideſt of November.
               
               Now how I ſhall ſpend all this time, and bee able to giue that account, his Majeſtie doth expect, I know not, if I do not goe to the N W. For beſides it I am not inſtructed to ſearch, which being put into practice, if it proue not to be had there,

but that the land doth ſtretch to the E. as Baffine reports in 65.
                     Moneths September. deg. 25 m. then they account will be ſatisfied, and we may retourne in ſhort time, for this is not aboue ſixe dayes worke, if God pleaſe this S. winde ſhall ſtand, and we may come downe betwixt Sr. Dudlies Diggs Ile, and Cape Wolſtenholme, into the bottome of Mr. Hudſons E. Bay, and there winter. Which if we doe, we muſt ſtay vntill Auguſt, as experience had ſhewne vs. (Which was neere a whole 11. months) and therefore now would be the beſt: but to write truth, the Mr. would giue no conſent, but to keepe all ſafe by ſeeking for harbour, but his mates anſwere was.
               Captaine, if there bee any thing more to be done? let vs fall to it, whileſt the wind is good, ſo grace being ſaid, I came foroth and weering out the maine ſheate, commaunded him at helme to goe away N. E. by E. when comming more open Hudſons Bay, the winde at S. blowing, but to both top-ſailes on taunt, there came ſo high a Sea from S. E. as if it had come from land 200. leagues diſtance, it came ſo naturally 
                     •
                  oamming, and therefore I doe belieue, that the E. ſide of thoſe Bayes, lyeth farther E. wards towards the River of Cannada, and the Longitude thereof is more Eaſterly then is placed in the Marine Maps, ſtanding hence as before we fell into 20. and 30. fathomes, making way 7. or 8. leagues the watch; this day was faire weather, in the night was much lightning.
               I named the Cape I laſt parted from, Wolſtenholmes vltimum vale, for that I do beleeue Sr. Iohn Wolſtehholme will not lay out any more monies in ſearch of this Bay. And yet thus much, if he had beene wanting heerein; I am of opinion, that the moſt of thoſe diſcoveries, had never beene attempted: for my owne part I can ſay, for ſo I find, that he hath been, for 8. Voyages the principall adventurer in ſtocke (and Treaſrror) ſupplying the ſlacke adventure, when the ſtocke came ſlowly in, and I dare affirme, concerning this Voyage of mine; that he was at leaſt 400. l. out at my home comming, although I did retourne in 6. compleate monethes: ſaving 12. monthes vituall and pay, and beſides, I am confident, that hee cannot bee leſſe out then 1100 l. about this diſcovery.
               Yet I am perſwaded that vpon good grounds (of which I doe knowe him to bee very able to judge) that no ſubject in this kingdome parrallelling his degree, would ſooner advance

to the furtherance of this, or any other deſigne of ſuch worth, which hee thinkes may redownd to his Majeſties honour, and 
                     Moneths September. his countries good.
               This morninges W. winde brought in a Sea ſo high, andHigh Sea. grimme, as though it had in fury overthrowne all lands, and ſhoales, enterpoſing the paſſage betwixt vs and Iapon; it ſwelled ſo Mountanous high from the N. W. as who of ſea-men had ſeene the ſame, would haue ſaid, that there could bee noeMuch winde land from whence the ſame came not of 6. or 700. leagues, and my ſelfe alſo if experience had not ſhewne me the contrary. I was in latitude, 57. deg. 28. m. and from my ſetting from Vltimum Vale 48 leagues the winde came from N. N. W. and ſtript mee into a leaſe of cources, or 3. loweſt ſailes, almoſt as much wind as at any time ſince I came from home, and more behalfe then I found, ſince I entered Fretum Hudſons, or 300. leagues beyond, towards night I layed to the Weſt in maine courſe, for feare I might hazard my ſelfe in the night, amongſt hoſe Ilands which M. Hudſon (for good reaſon) calls by the name of Lancaſters Iles; all this night I had deepe 47. 44. 40. 54. 50 fathomes.
               This day morning I tackt to N. wards, at noone was in 52.Latit. 57. de. 55. min. fathomes: lati. 57. de. 55. m. both top-ſayles caſt over the lowſayles,
                     Da 4 or courſes now goeth on Bonnets, I made way in Try 6. lea. S. W. &amp; 12. 2. m. N. E. this night came the wind S. E. a pretty gale, it was over-caſt with darknes, wee came by a ſmall Iland at clocke one, the higheſt I haue ſeene ſince I came from Brooke Cobham the deepe 70. fathome: I named the Ile Sleepe.
               
               I made way from laſt noone, to this 30. leagues N. and this morning was ſome ſlight.
               I was conſtrained to breake vp the Pinnas (now growne 
                     Da 5
                  Pinace gone. leake) although I did ſoare doubt the want of her, what ever might befall me: but ſhe being a dragge at ſterne, and it was too could and wet, to keepe men in her, to haue kept her at ſayle, and as much hinderance to ſhake the ſhippe in the winde, vntill ſhee were made dry; beſides my men were pittilully wet. I cutte out the toughts and nayles, and ſaved as much as I could, and ſent the reſt to hazard, though againſt my will, for I did thinke if ſhee had ſtoode tyght, ſhe might haue afforded mee ſome helpe in the N. W. whither now I am going, and if it proue a Bay, or trent, E. wards, then God willing I will

hazard to winter in Port Nelſon, to the intent I may the next yeare ſearch vt vltra, where the paſſage I hope doth lye. For if 
                     Moneths September. it bee not in that vndiſcovered, betwixt Sr. Thomas Buttons ankoring laſt vpon the W. ſide, and Cary Swanns-Neſt, nor at this hoped N. W. then it is not to be looked for, to the W. of Groynland; and though as yet I haue not tryed the N. W. yet by what I heard from Bilct and Baffin in their life time (which was
                     Baffines Report that if there had bin hopes, they would haue perſiſted. But quoth Baffin, there I will neuer goe to ſeeke it) my ſelfe, haue farre greater confidence, that it ſhould lye neerer Sr. Thomas Rowes Welcome, being moved by the high flowing of the Tyde, and the Whales, for all the tydes that floweth, that Bay, commeth (neere) from thence.

                  Mr. ſicke vpon the vper decke theſe 2. or 3. dayes, all els are in health, thankes be vnto God: this morning the hoary froſt hung in our Roapes.
               This coole after-noone, the winde veered N. N. E. it blew at moſt but to courſe and bonnet: our ſhip begins to make water, when ſhee comes to bee wrunge with lowe ſayles. Wee were much troubled with ſtockadge of Coales, before we came into the paſſage, and heere againe which Coales wee brought for fiering, if need ſhould ſtand, the windes are variable heere: this night was calme, this eaſie gale S. E. brought vs ſince laſt day 13. leagues N. W. 2. parts N.
               Wee made way from laſt day 12. to this 12. 34. leagues by 
                     Da 7 the logge-board, and at noone I was in 61. 15 m. the deepeLa. 61. d. 15. m. was 90. fathomes; all this day with E. S. E. winde I ſtoode N. E. by N. cloſe hailed, 13. leagues: this night I ſee the land, by my account about Carie Swanns-Neſt, from whence I departed the 21. of Iuly, the morning was ſleete, the day after was faire, and froſt. Now the Maſter and three men more are downe, God better it; I thinke if I had not come foorth vpon the Decke as I did, we had runne a ſhoare vpon this low land, I cauſed preſently to tacke about, and we ſtoode off a gaine into 70. fathomes, wee had but 14. preſently after wee were tackt.
               Wee were in 62. deg. 21. m. the land true North 6, myles 
                     Da 8 off, I found it to be Cape Pembrooke 2 or 3. leagues diſtance N. E. from Carie Swans-Neſt with this S. E. winde I was faine to

plye it up for Sea-horſe point, hoping as before for change of Winds, untill then wee muſt bite upon the Bowline, this 
                     Moneths September. land is ſtonie, and a good bold ſhoare. I ſtood off into 90. and in againe into 13. fathomes, and ſometimes leſſe, as I had ſight, there goeth but ſmall Tydes, for here are neither Riplings nor over-falls, this mornings Amplitude was 21. deg. the Land doth make Bayes, and Capes, lying one from another about N. E. it is ſtill faire weather, and wee have carried both Top-ſayles out ſince the 4. both day and night.
               By this we have plyde up another Cape, the deepe of whoſe 
                     Da 9 
                  Bay, betwixt the ſame: and Cape Pembroke, maketh the E. ſide thereof lye neare S. and by E. I was in 7. fathom. in the Bay, after this Cleare Sunne-riſing, fell a ſhort fogge, the blowing away thereof, blew in both our Top-ſayles; when I doubled this Cape, the Land ſtretcht to the N. in dutifull remembrance I named it Cape Linſey; at ſome boords wee gate but little, as I could perceive by the Land, and yet I cannot diſcerne any Tyde to come againſt us; the Land lyeth now N. E. laſt night were many Petty-dancers, we had in both Top-ſayles, and ſtood off, and on, betweene 20. and 80. fathomes, the Sea came high, and we purchaſt nothing.
               This faire mornings cleare ayre blew hard, I cannot conjecture 
                     Da 10 of the Tydes, for if as Sir Thomas Button doth write, that the Floud doth come from N. W. at Iſle Nottingham, I am ſure there is another comes from S. E. at the ſame Iſle, Thoſe two meeting ſhould both ſet into the Bay of Hudſon, and Button, and eſpecially upon this W. ſide, pasſing from Seahorſe Poynt, by thoſe Capes to Cary Swannes-Neſt, ſhould ſtrongly be forced here, being backt by thoſe Winds, but I find no ſuch thing, for notwithſtanding the Sea comming Compter from Hudſons Straights, and about Mansſils Ile, (from the E. Mayne) yet I gain'd, yea and in low ſayles, when much Winde compells in my Top-ſayles, which doth ſhew, that of the two, the Tyde doth ſet with me, theſe cold miſts, thicks, and drops, doth make many men droope, and thoſe who formerly complained, are not willing to come above-decke.

E. with his conſtant flowing and ebbing, doth make them conceiue, that this hard labour is in vaine: Yet they ſay nothing to mee, but that the N. W. tide was miſtaken; for the Maſters of the Trinity Houſe were very carefull that I ſhould bee well man'd, ſo that I had not aboue 5. but were capable of an accompt, and therefore the eaſier to bee gouerned, and more helpefull to the deſigne, thus wee ended the euening in feaſting, and repoſed vntill clocke 12. in the night, and then wee weighed ankor againe, Mr. Hurine and my ſelfe, hoping by this faire meanes to jndure our ſufferings, thereby to ſee the hopes of the ſuppoſed paſſage this way: This ebbe wee held it vp vnder-

               I rid now in latitude about 65. 50. min. the day came on, and 
                     Da 20 I ſee the land lie along N. E. by E. with 2. Iſlands neere, the one a league off the other, bearing S. E. and S. E. by E. co

               I made way from 11. that I weighed anchor, to 5. 12. leagues N. E. by N. when I raiſed a point, or head-land of good height, decfending to the Sea, or W. wards, the Throughlet, or Bay on the Starbord (as I did coaſt the E. ſide) I could not ſee the bottome, not of 7. or 8. leagues deepe, I had 43. fathomes oazie ground; from this Cape the land doth trent to the S. ward of E. the further I came to the N. wards, I haue ſtill darker nights, the Moone is waineing, and it's could weather.
               Comming neere vnto this Cape, I ſee many ouer-falls, and races in the Tides face, being deeper, &amp; with more breacke then heretofore, ſo as I cauſed an ankor to bee made ready, hauing then 20. fathomes, but before I came to the firſt ouer-fall, I had but 7. 8. 10. differing as faſt as the lead went down: I anchored in 8. the Cape bore S.

               To conclude, I doe account this Cape to lie ſome mi. withinArtick Cirkle. the Artick Cirkle; it ſtretcheth E. wards as before, which in hazie weather, as in the night is eaſie to diſcerne in thoſe parts, for the land lying hid in ſnow, doth cauſe a white reflexe; in the Ayre all night, as though it were dawning or twi-light, before and after ſun-ſet, this Cape I named my Lord Weſtons Portland.

               Now you ſhall vnderſtand, that the ankor had Cadged a great while, when comming to take (a ſudaine) hold, broke the two Laſhers of our ſtoppers, and hal'd the Cable about the bitts, the tide taking the ſhip away E. 4. knots ½ ſhee hauing driuen an honre, or more before: In the morning the land beare S. by W. from vs, ſo that wee though wee had run through it the laſt nights ebbe, when it prooued the former, as Lord Weſtous Portland, for in that bearing i ſeemed like an Iſleland, the deepeneſſe of the Bay, to the S.

               After I was got cleere, I had for ſome reaſons thought to have home come by the N. but the weaknes of our perſons, the long nights, the cold dark weather, with the decayed Moone, altered my purpoſe, although the N. by Orkny, was the ſhorteſt cut, and ſo nearer ſome refreſhing, yet this being the warmer, and in darke nights the more comfortable; I directed the courſe to fall with the Iland of Silly, having yet great care day and night, ſpecially to looke out for the Ice, which I ſuppoſedSee for Ice. might be ſet from off Groenland, or out of Fretum Davis, but God be thanked we ſee none, (after we came from the Cape.

               1 I had been immured with Ice, from the firſt day of my entering Fretum Hudſon, being the 23 day of Iune, vntill the 4 of Iuly following, after which time, I got cleere, and comming unto Salisbury Iſle, I lay faſt againe betweene the South and the North Maine, about 7 dayes amongſt ice, where being neere the ſaid Iſle I could eaſily diſcerne the Tyde come from the Eaſt, through Fretum Hudſon▪
                   and not from the Northweſt.
               2 Getting cleere of the ice, I trent about the ſaid Iſle to the South, as alſo Nottinghams, where ſending the Boat on land, brought word that it had flowed ſo much water, as in my Iournall is mentioned of, and that the water had more to flowe, and after that running off into 60 fathomes, and anchoring the Boat, I found the Tyde come from the South-Eaſt or through Fretum Hudſon.
               
               3 Standing along the ſaid Iſle to W. ward, untill I brought the ſame, I meane the W. end N. E. it began to be full of ice, in the W. Channell, betwixt Nottingham and Shark Point, as before betwixt the North Maine and Salisbury, ſo as the Maſter his Mate, and my ſelfe conclude, that there was no entring the ſaid Northweſt▪ as yet, or untill the ice was diſſolved; and to that point, the Maſter and Mate, wiſhed me to write what I would concerning that impoſsibility of paſſage untill the ice were gone, and they would ſigne the ſame, promiſing that they would bee willing to ſee the ſame, before their going home, if no paſſage proved elſewhere to be found.
            
            
               Whereupon conſidering, that that Tyde came not from the North-Weſt for certaine, which is the abſolute ground of my inſtructions, but from South-Eaſt, diſproved alſo by Maſter Bylot, (who was in the ſame Voyage and ſhip,

with Sir Thomas Button) ſaying that both he and all his Company, did plainely ſee the Tyde come from S. E. at Cape Comfort, and alſo the Ile Nottingham, averring that they which tooke that account were miſtaken, in the time, taking 8 a clocke for 10.
               Now as it was not poſſible as yet to enter for ice, the wind being liberall I directed the courſe towards Carie Swan

               Being come out of Hudſons Bay, and Anchoring at Sharke Point, I found the Ebbe to goe with good Current from the Weſt, but the South-Eaſt flood Tyde did ſlacke the ſame, when it came, but how it did flow and what water I cannot report for want of my journall, it being now out off my hands, but I did finde the ſame flood-tide to anſwere the report of Maſter By

               But to the purpoſe, the winds were North-weſt, nor could I ſtay the change thereof, for the moſt of my beſt men, as Maſter, Gunner, Carpenter, Boatſwaine his Mate, and one or two of the common men were downe, the reſt complaining of cold paines, and no marvell, they having beene over-toyled in the bottome of Sir Thomas Buttons Bay, (and that undiſcovered betwixt him and Hudſon) with watching and warding day and night, manning both Shippe, Boate, and Pinnace, both in Anchoring and Sayling (but eſpecially at Leade, when in all the time of my Sayling the ſaid Bay, there was never one from keeping the ſame.
               
                  The weather had beene for about 3 weekes before, nothing but Snow, Froſt, and ſleet at beſt, our ſelves, ropes, and ſayles froaze, the Sunne ſeldome to be ſeene or once in five dayes, the nights 13 houres long, the Moone wayning, and in concluſion, I was enforced either to ſeeke for Harbour, or freeze to death in the Sea.
               Whereupon I ſent Maſter 
                     Ʋrine, to aske the Maſters opinion, who brought unto me, that he thought the Tydes ſetting from S. E. almoſt round about to E. would give good ſatisfaction (for this N. W. ſearch, begun by a wrong report of the Tydes comming from thence) to the Adventurers, and that hee helde it fitteſt to returne. Yea, and the beſt alſo, as I thought, and homewards, and for good cauſe as hereafter followeth.
               Firſt, I referre it to the judgment of indifferent men, whether having proceeded in theſe Diſcoveries, further then any other my Predeceſſors, in leſſe time, and at leſſe charge, have cloſed up all the expected hopes upon the W. ſide of Buttons Bay, from 64½ circularly to 55, and on the Point from Swans Neſt, to Sharke Point, not perfectly diſcovered but now by mee, and carried a Tyde, comming from South-Eaſt through Fretum Hudſon, all along that Eaſt ſide to 66 degrees 30 minutes, or thereabouts, (things not knowne heretofore) that I ſhould hazzard the loſſe thereof to my Countrey, If I ſhould have periſhed in ſeeking an unknowen Harbour, in long nights and cold weather, with ſo many men ſicke, who could not have recovered in the wintering, howſoever their helpes would have beene wanting, in lying, or Barracadoing the ſhip from ice, for whereſoever I had wintered, I muſt have h
                     •
                  led the ſhip high on ſhore, and Barracadoe; as alſo in making my proviſions of freſh victuals, and fuell. The neceſſitie of this, Sir Thomas Button is able to approve to his deare bought experiment.
               Well, if I had wintered it muſt have beene with intent to make ſearch, to the North of Sir Tho. Roes Welcome, for in all the hopefull places elſe I was denyed, and there, and not far frō thence, as about Vtultra, it is, for to give a wiſe Gentlemā his right (who peruſing Sir Tho. Buttons journall about that place, quoteth in the Margent) theſe words, I doe not find it is proved a Bay, this was ſuſpected by him before, I came to

that knowledge thereof, which I have now, but to proceed, how ſhould I be able to doe this ſervice, when the winter would have conſumed all the beſt of my comfortable ſtores, as ſtrong Beere, ſtrong waters, ſacke, ſpice, fruite, Rice, Wheat meale, and of my Chirurgery; and if no releife had beene otherwiſe got from land, to have lengthened the moſt of the proviſion, as Beefe, Beere, and Fiſh.
               Yet had I had no more then would have brought home the Ship, if my men had ſtood, and if by their death, or reliefe of birds or Deere, I had ſtore remaining, yet I doubt the remayning ſtomacks, would have beene too weake (before the long winter there had left them) to have endured ſalt meate in the Summer, ſo as the more victuall the fewer hands for labour, and there would be no ſparing as I conceived by ſhort allowance.
               All theſe and many other ſufferings endured, is but all for the next yeares Search, about which I have ſhewed, I had no reaſon to ſtay, to put ſo much to hazzard knowing what I had inquired from ſome, both of Sir Thomas Button, and Mr. Hudſons men of their ſufferings, and yet it was July, before they could get well to ſea to returne home. And it doth appeare by Sir Thomas Buttons owne words, that he would have proceeded the next yeare if he had not been diſabled.
               For when, after my home comming, I told him hee could not be certaine of the Tyde he tooke at Notingham, was true; for that his boate was never on land, his anſwere was (God a mercy for nothing) for I had not above 8 
                     •
                  ound men; ſo this doth appear as I did cōceive, before my returne. I cōclude that theſe things in part knowne to me, in part imagined, that if I ſhould not have made good uſe thereof, having diſcovered ſo much as I had done, if I would thus have ſuffered, I had bin well ſerved, to have come home unpittied.
            
            
               
               The benefit enſuing by my comming home this yeare.
               INprimis my ſicke men are (God be glorified) all recovered. The account of my ſervice by my ſelfe &amp; others brought home, I hope to the ſatisfying of my King and Country, and more then ever was formerly done by any of my predeceſſours by much, and at farre leſſe charge.
               The ſhip and tackling all ſafe, and without any loſſe of either, which was not done without great hazzard, going from the Latit. of 55. in Hudſons Bay, into the Articke circle towards the end of September.
               
               There is alſo 6 Months pay and victuals ſaved at above 75 pounds per month, amounting to the ſome of nere 450 poū. and if they doe not ſet forth the next yeare, then there is 11 months pay and victuals ſaved, there is one Sommers time gained, for if this be diſtruſted or more required (I meane in diſcovery) who is ſo pleaſed may ſet forth the beginning of May, and ſatisfie their deſire this next yeare, with ſhip newly repaired, newly manned with freſh men, &amp; untainted with skurvie, crampe or cold paines, but more and better able to performe, the enterprize, then the Winterer can be.
               To conclude I referre it to the judgement of reaſonable diſcretion, whether it may be held fit, that I ſhould ſuffer, either by want of liberty, good reward or imputation (as hath been wiſhed) untill the returne of Capt. James, who had no intent as by his anſwer doth appeare, who when I inquired of him, why he being ſo late had not attempted the N, W. as we both were inſtructed, anſwered that Baffine ſatisfied in his

                        ••
                      Hope to 64½. where the chiefeſt hope was (as I had done) nor ioyned Hudſon and Sir Thomas Button, it may bee thought, he being a Gentleman of quality, will not come untill he have done as much as I being a man of meaner

Ranke (in his conceite, for I have heard ſince that his ambition hath abuſed my worth and name) I told him my further intent, which was to attempt the N, W. this yeare, all which to do he muſt ſtay the next yeare, as my ſelfe would, if he had left me in the like caſe, nor can no unkindneſſe be laid to my charge for not bringing of letters from him, taking a fayre farwell of him, for he had time enough in two dayes to have writ, nor was I certaine as then of my returne, which now I doe thanke God for. If this will ſatisfie to ſtop the mouth of Rumor, which hath already touched too much vpon my deſerts, I ſhall bee glad; otherwiſe, I wiſh they would ſuffer themſelves to be judged by performing the like labour.
               Theſe rumours like ill Newes ridde poaſt, for they came to Court; inſomuch as comming by Boate with a Gentleman from Oatlands to London, where I had beene to deliver my Accompts to his Majeſty, it pleaſed the Gentleman to ſay, that now is Captaine James in the Mare del Zur, and will come home by Cape Bon Sperance.
               
               I was ſo confident that he could doe no more for that yeare I did leave him, and for the yeare to come, that I replyed with three wiſhes or deſires to my good or ill.
               
                  The firſt was, that if Captaine Iames did paſſe through and come home that way, that I might be ſeverely puniſhed according as I did acknowledge I did deſerve.
               
               
                  The next was, that if at his home-comming, (for which I prayed vnto Almighty God,) that it did appeare vpon examination (equally ballanced) that hee had done as much as I and no more, I might have reaſonable Reward, for ſo I had deſerved.
               
               
                  The third, that if hee had not done ſo much, that I might be rewarded with what I had ſaved, to wit; Eleven moneths victuall and pay, at 75. pounds per Moneth, and according to the wearing and tearing of Cordage and Tackling that I had ſaved, which hee would ſpend.
               
               Now ſince hee is returned home, and hath neyther beene through nor performed ſo well as I by very much, I deſire to be rewarded as before; and for that this was rehearſt before his home-comming, and when I did not know where hee was.
            
            
               
               That there is a Paſſage, hath beene proffered to be proued very Learnedly by Sr 
                  Humphrey Gilbert Knight, foure ſeverall wayes, as followeth.
               
                  THe firſt by Authority, alledging America to bee that Iland called by Plato and others Atlantes, ſayled vnto by the Carthagineans, and that it is bound on the Eaſt by the Atlanticke ſea from which it is named, on the South by Magelan ſtraights, on the Weſt by Mar del Zur, on the North it is ſevered from Groenland by the Sea, through which the Paſſage doth lye. And to confirme the former Diſcovery, he brings in Money found by the Spaniards in the Gold mines of America, having the ſtampe of Auguſtus Caeſar, and ſince that time the diſcontinuance hath beene, for that it hath beene ſwallowed vp and overflowen with water through a mighty Earthquake, ſo as the Navigation thereunto was ſince that time loſt, vntill the yeare 1492. that Columbus did after diſcover the ſame, (although Malga Prince of Wales was before him) pretending that ſince its appearance againe, the Seas about it are made deeper, and the Northweſt made more eaſie to be ſayled, confirming the Concluſion by the Coſmographers of thoſe moderne times, eſpecially Ortelius, who maketh both Groenland and America both Ilands, diſ-joyned by a great Sea from any part of Aſia.
               
                  The ſecond is by Reaſon; for ſayling from Iſeland to where this Freet ſhould be, its thought to bee more deeper water, and that if America were not an Iland, it and Aſia ſhould participate of each others animals, or things of like ſhape or condition as Men, Beaſts, and others, of which there hath

                  N▪ Cape▪
                   (although I doe aſſure mee that this paſſage lyeth South-wards off that parallell, and about the Articke Circle) that this Continent of the Septentrionall part of America, may incline to the Weſt Southward about this latitude, as that of Europes doth to the Eaſt, for by this flowing of water in 60 d. 10 m. neere 4 fathomes (as at Resolution in the Eaſt) it cannot be farre to the winding of the land Weſtwards.
               The next is to inquire from whence this Tyde ſhould come, for that is the way to the paſſage, for it cannot be ſaid to come from the Eaſt through Fretum Hudson, for there need no more to diſprove that then what went before, when that Tyde did end at Carie Swans Neſt, in flowing but 6 foote

and 4 houres, as it doth at the height, of all Rivers being farre from the Sea.
               Should it come from the North, then it ſhould as well Current that land on the Eaſt ſide of this Bay to Carie Swans Neſt along that ſmall diſtance of 40 leagues, if ſuch a thing be at all or no, as upon the Weſt ſide. For, 250 leagues of now knowne diſcovery ſetting from the North, it ſhould divide equall waters betwixt them, which is found to the contrary, and if ſuch land doth lie 40 leagues along from Swannes Neſt Weſtward, then is there not aboue 30 more for the brenth of the paſſage, frō through whence this ride doth come which I ſhould thinke were to narrow to let in and out ſo much water in the time mentioned; to bring any flood on this ſide, now in handling, for at Swannes Neſt the flood ſet Weſt, and the Ebbe Eaſt; and if this Tyde going Weſt, were met with more water, from thence, it muſt flow extraordinarily high at the Neſt (as in great Rivers in time of land-waters, the Sea flood meeting, puts up the waters to ſuch heights, as doth inforce all their bounds) and rejected the Tydes courſe, which I found to be conſtant, for that I was there two floods one ebbe and a halfe.
               How can it now be imagined but that the T
                     •
                  de doth come from the Weſt, and ſo coaſteth along the ſame ſide, as wee may obſerve upon all Tydes from what ſea ſoever they come, looke upon what ſide they enter, they Current the ſame, and ſo doth this, for that called Vtultra, never proved Bay yet, and who hath named the ſame, might as well be deceived here as at other places by fogs, bankes, for if this part be protracted, I cannot ſee that there is any diſcovery made at all on both ſides (betweene Hubarts vaine hope, and Swanne
                        •
                      Neſt) worth the noting.
               Therefore it muſt be confeſt that this Tyde doth come from the Weſt, ſo inclining to that ſhore, and that it is a Tide hath been proved, for I doe not thinke that there's any that will pretend inundating, impulſing, or ingulfing, and thatInſtruction it doth proceed from ſome great Ocean, is without all contradiction; for comming to this Weſt ſide, I found great ſtore of fiſh playing at the cruſt of the water, and of great fiſh which is a maine argument, for there was Whales, Sea-mors,Whales, Sea mors. and Seales, of which there are infinite, which fiſh doe not

hive in Winter but in deepe Oceans, and that thoſe Whales muſt come from the Weſt, is certaine, for all the way from Cape Farewell, in all that diſtance of neere 500 leagues; we did not ſee one untill I came there, which if there had beene any lying ſo long becalmed and amongſt the ice, having light nights, we ſhould have ſeene them, for they are fiſh that affect to play and breath above the water.
               The maine land was high within Sir Thomas Roes Welcome, as in all the ſtraights beſides, with deepe water to ſhore, whereas diſcovering Southwards, it fell to bee low land with ſhallow ſhore, at 11 fathoms, wee could but ſee it upon the hatches. This is much contrary to the Oceans, who are bounded with high mountainous climes, ſteepe Promontories, ragged Rockes, and inamoled Ilands, ſubſiſting upon inſearchable deepes, ſalt, and greene-coloured waters, wherein live the great ſiſhes.
               Now let us compare this Tyde with ſome others neerer our owne home, with which we are the moſt familiar; as to begin at the mouth of the River Thames, towards which, two Tydes reſort.
               And at the mouth thereof it floweth a S. and N. Moone, at the S. Foreland, S▪ S. E. in the Channell of the Ile of Wight, S. E. or S. E. by S. at Plimmouth E. at the Gulfe where the Ocean doth firſt enter our Channell, E. N. E▪ this reckoning goeth againſt the Sunne and Moone, yet this is the way to finde the Sea from whence the tide doth come.
               Likewiſe, along ſtthe North coaſt, there commeth another tide to the ſaide River bringing the like flowing, and almoſt anſwerable at the ſame diſtance, for from off Harwich, it floweth S. S. E. at Yarmouth, S. E. at Lareſneſſe, E. by N. at Whitby, N. E. at Barwick, N. N. E. at Backha

               It may be objected that although by all likely hood that is a paſſage, yet it may prove to be a great diſtance to ſaile through, and how ſhall a man doe to know when he is thorow, that thereby he may direct his courſe Southward.
               I anſwere it can be no great diſtance, for that the water doth heighten in Spring-Tydes, almoſt as much water at Sir Thomas Roes Welcome in the Spring Tydes, as at C. Warwicke which ſtandeth in the edge of the Hyperborion Ocean, and therefore how can this Tyde come farre from his ſea, and bring conſtantly as much water as it floweth in any place that ſtandeth neere the Oceans lips; How can then the Mare del Zur, be farre from hence, for the diſtance betweene Cape Warwicke and Swans Neſt, is not above 200 leagues where this Tydes quite conſumed, ſo at the like diſtance from Sir Thomas Roes Welcome, This new Tyde along that Bay holds the ſame untill in the bottome thereof, it be conſumed, for I have heard from ſome, that if North winds doth not inforce the Tydes that they doe not flow above two foot in Hudſon

               Me thinketh there is three materiall proofes that maketh better for our purpoſe, for to anſwere and free this doubt, though all the reſt of Sir Humphrey Gilbert and Maſter Wills, makes for the paſſage.
               The firſt is that the Coſmographers of China doe extend their coaſts to the N. E. even to the 50 d. of latitude, and may doe further for any thing they know.

               It may alſo be ſaid that the Articke Circle is farre N. and that it will be froſt, Icy and cold, and that there is but two moneths in the yeare to make this triall, for in the reſt it will not be nauigable.
               I anſwere, that the Articke circle is not ſo farre N. as the Cape of Finmarke neere in 73 d. where there is few or no Ice at any time, and thereby it is Navigable at all times, but that there is no trading in winter; beſides the Sunne having great declination South, it is all night. But what is this to the Sea that is cleare of Ice, the like may this be for any yet knowne, for after I went from Swannes Neſt, I ſee no yce to the N. nor doe I thinke there was any to the Weſt, for the winde

blowing from the ayre was as warme as in England in the latter end of Auguſt, and the land had no ſnow thereon, although it be very high land, and ſurely is inhabited, for elſe how could there have beene ſo many corps inwalled at Sir Thomas Roes Welcome, yet paſſing from hence S. ward into the bay it was colder, and yet warme enough.
               And for thoſe Ice which are ingendred in this ſhallow ſandy Bay is but as in other places in Europe nere the ſame Latit. for thoſe that have gone timely into the Balticke Sea hath found yce comming out of the Sound, and it is no marvaile to ſee the ſame froze over, which in thoſe parts is as uſuall as to have a nooſe, to have the ſhipping froze all the whole winter therein, and for waggons to goe in winter where Ships

                  aile in Sommer for many miles; for it is well knowne that thoſe Sandy Eaſterne low countreys, as Sprutia, Denmarke, Friſland, and the Neather lands, are in winter ſubiected to violent froſt, then why ſhould not wee allow this low ſandy countrey and Bay the like, being about the ſame parallell, and a Bay as the Balticke is alſo from thence, which Latit. where it freezeth ſo hard, is from 52 to 57d. but elevate the Pole to 73 d. there at that time of winter in the ſame continent, there is no yce but that you may ſaile Sea free into the coaſt of Ruſſia, why ſhuld then this our Weſterne paſſage be denyed of as good an opinion but that it may be Sea free as well as theirs to ſaile into the Mare del Zur to Cathaia, being doubtleſſe to the Southward of that parallell; theſe a places of Europe and America, thus anſwering one another both in quality and clime.
               Goe to Iſeland as the Fiſhers doe now in March the North part lying in the Articke circle, and yet thoſe Fiſhermen are not ſo troubled with Ice but that they can ſaile about it, and for the yce they finde there they conceive to be ingendred in the Bayes, Rivers, and Inlets of Groneland, and not about the Iland nor in the Sea: It now appeares as I ſaid before that this country doth but comply with thoſe countries Eaſtward, and the like may be expected by them that is found by the other, nor can this channell be narrow, that in 6 poynts of the compaſſe being but 4 howres ½. of time, to wit, from Sir Thomas Roes Iland to Port Nelſon, doth ſend a flood and ebbe it backe againe along the coaſt for 150 leag. knowne in ſo ſhort time and this to accord with the Moone.
               
                  To remonſtrate this by example▪ Admit I were ſent out of Ruſſia to diſcover a land that I have heard lyeth farre S, W. which ſupoſe to be, Atlantis or America, now it muſt be thought that I know of noland to the W. of Europes continent and therefore when I am come about the C. of Finmarke I direct my courſe to the S. and W. wards as ſoone as the land will give me leave. For I doe know that it doth trent ſo, and that the coaſt of Norway is bonded with an Ocean, now bending towards to the W. of S. not knowing of great Brittaine I direct my I courſe gaineſt as I conceive, imagining that at ſhall meet with no land to the W. of Europe, but thinking thus to proceede I finde the land to meet mee to the W. as I thought to have ſailed to wit the coaſt of great Brittaine, and there I finde a tide going along the land to the S. ward, I follow this coaſt hopeing it may caſt about to the W. and as I proceede ſo doth this tide keeping the height of his water ſtill, ſo by this ebbing and flowing, courſe and Latit. I doe aſſure it to my ſelfe that it cannot be any part of the maine continent of Europe, nor adioyning thereunto, and thus perſuing to the S. in long diſtance I finde that this tyde doth ſtill continue his height of
                     Calis and Dover.
                   water ſo by that I ſpeede on with more comfort, at length I come betwixt a maine lands, and doubting ſome alteration or imbayment, I keep ſtill the W. ſide for thereby I muſt obtaine my intent if at all, but now when I come to make triall of my tyde I find, it hath left mee, which to fore convayed me many leag▪ along this unknowne coaſt, and now my tide of flood commeth from the W, ward and againſt me as I ſhould

               Even ſo may this tide of mine in perſuing his ebbe from the place where I found it firſt bring me into the Mare a

               Againe a Compariſon fained to be ſailed into a Sea through our owne Kingdome from the Eaſt Sea to the Weſt.
               ADmit I come from Hambrough or the Eaſterne Sea to expediate a Voyage through a great Ocean in a Country I have heard to lye far to the W. directing my courſe W. ward I met with land ſooner then I did expect in coaſting this land W. wards, I find an entrance which I follow for by my account I am but newly come to Sea and muſt be farre ſhort of my intent, but following this entrance I finde there is ebbing and flowing which I purſue and finde it to be a River, which conceive to be the river of Thames, I goe therein with the tide without debarre or hinderance, yet finding the further up that I do proceede the tide heightneth leſſe water and runeth leſſe time, ſo as knowing I goe from the Eaſt, W. ward as I deſire, yet I doe not know what will become of this hazzard, but not knowing how to mend my ſelfe I muſt now play the game this way, at length I come to the head of this river, which conceive to be at Kingſton, there I finde this tide which I followed out of the Eaſterne Sea, to fall into a ſpacious and large Mare or Ponte which Mare I enter. Now it muſt be conceived, that all the Country betweene Kingſton and Severn neere Briſtow as part of Surry part of Hampſhire, Wiltſhire, Gloſterſhire, Oxford, Buckingham and part of Middleſex.
               
               To be ingulfed and turned into an inland Sea round about, being entred in this Ponte I begin to circuit about by the S, S, W. and comes to W. ſide where I finde an Inlet to wit the riverIn Gloſterſhire.
                   at Barkly comming from the W. Sea out of Severne ebbing and flowing into the Mare as that did on the E. ſide by which I entred, now I intend to venter into this ebbing and flowing of waters from the W. and thus perſiſting againſt the tyde by obſervation, as yeſterday it flowed a W. Moone, this day it flowed a W. by N. Moone keeping this conſtant fluxe and refluxe from the W. Eaſtward ſo as ſayling I ſhorten the tyde and is come in ſhort diſtance, to the place where it flowed S. W. the ſame tide I tooke at my entring this river or inſet to flow W. I may now aſſure my ſelfe that thoſe tyde ſtreames are ſupported by waters from an Ocean which by purſuite I find to be the Atlanticke,
               
               
                  It is to be obſerved in diſcoveries, as is found in other places by experience, that in ſayling againſt the flood-tide wee ſhorten the time of flowing, and in ſayling therewith wee lengthen the ſame.
            
            
               This compariſon ſtandeth thus.
               
                  HAmbrough is England, from whence we ſaile to Fretum Hudſon, which here is conceived to be the Thames, whoſe head as Kingſton, is Cary Swans Neſt, the Country, Pont or Mar, ſo ingulfed is Hudſons or Buttons Bay, the W. Tide comming out of the Ocean at Severne is that new Tide I found at Sir Thomas Roes Ile, which purſued will bring me into the Mare del Zur.
               
               Let it not now be ſaid, that there is no paſſage by the N, W into India, for that the beſt Coſmographers, thoſe learned in the Mathematickes and all Arts, have in former time conſented that America is an Iland and ſeparated from any other continent, by which great Princes have been perſwaded to adventure and countenance with great Summes, (nor were their hopes miſtaken, although as yet God hath not appoynted the time) as alſo the Nobility, Gentry, &amp; Merchants, when in the Voyage of Sir Thomas Button, were about 160 adventurers.
               My comfort is, that the quantity of Whales and Sea Mors that place affordeth (although it may be thought that I did not ſee the 100 part) will (when Whale oyle comes into requeſt) drive the Merchant to ſend the Marriner to viſite the Ile of Brooke Cobham for the Whale, &amp; with their ſhallops range N, wards to ſearch for Vnicorne horne, Mors teeth, and Whalefinne, to come where Sir Tho: Roe will bid them Welcome, and by theſe inticements they will be perſwaded to inquire after this tide, and at length bring home the good newes (which I expect) of this ſo long ſought for.
               For my part, I have now waſht the Black-moore theſe five yeares, having yet received neither Sallery, wages or reward;Laboured in vaine. except what ſom few Gentlemen hath, I know not whether in curteſie or charity beſtowed upon me having to fore had my meanes taken from me in the time of warres, betwixt France, Spaine and us, ſo as I am utterly unable to proſecute the ſame though I wiſh well thereto, knowing it is now to be done at very ſmall charge.
               
                  And this is more for their great comfort, that it hath pleaſed almighty God of his great mercy, alwayes ſo to preſerve thoſe imployed this way to ſearch in this diſcovery, that no ſhip ever periſhed, but howſoever they ſuffered, the account was brought home, and wee made acquainted with their actions; all which, wee muſt acknowledge to be the providence of Almighty God, who hath thus preſerved thoſe ſeeds we have

               By which meanes in his diſcoveries N. ward towards the Pole, it was his good fortune to enter into a harbour in Greenland, where he found one Jonas Poole, and Nicholas Woodcocke with others in a ſhip of London diſtreſſed, for that a fall of an Ice had ſunke their Ship. Which ſubjects, with their oyles, Whale▪finnes, and Morsteeth, who muſt have miſerably periſhed there if he had not brought them home, to this noble Lords perpetuall honour and the future incouragement of that trade, now the moſt rich and ſafeſt that wee have. And this is the beſt by preſcription or any other claime the City of Yorke and the Corporation of Kingston vpon Hull can pleade for the continuance of their Trade thither; I make no doubt, but that they doe acknowledge his Lordſhip for the ſame with all thankfulneſſe. This Greeneland was firſt ſeene by Mr. Hudſon, who was countenanced by Sir Iohn Wolſtenholme, in his N E. courſaries.
