            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            This leſſon of Knowledge, begun to bee taught man in the beginning, and yet not as yet ended, when the end of all things is at hand, hath beene by GOD divers &amp; ſundry waies delivered vnto man; as he that knoweth

            So then theſe words of my Text are ſome part of The Booke of the World, where Nights are as it were the Blacke Inkie Lines of learning, Dayes the White Lightſome Spaces betweene the Lines: where GOD hath Imprinted a very legible Delineation of his Glory. And whereby GOD teacheth mā knowledge: evē now too, after that Knowledge (Cognitio Sancta 
               Iun &amp; Trem. ib.,the Knowledge, the Holy Knowledge of the Lord) is encreaſed, according to the prophecy of Daniel (Dan. 12. 4.) and that Act. 2. the ſeaventeenth and the eighteenth verſes, alleaged out of the Prophet Ioel. Yea even very now doth GOD teach man knowledge by the Booke of the World, when as the Booke of his Word lyeth before vs. This booke directing vs vnto that booke, and that booke leading vs vnto to this: and all to make Good Schollers of vs, if ſuch rare and excellent Bookes may beget any learning in

vs. It is written then in the booke of GOD, &amp; wrought by GOD in the booke of the world, One Day Telleth another.
            
            So that whether we wil learne it by

                     . rote.wrote, or elſe by the Booke; the booke of GOD, or the booke of the world: we haue our choice.
            Thinke not then (my deere Brethren) either this, or the knowledge of GOD to bee any hard leſſon for you to learne, and take it not for any Eleophuge So is the ſift propoſition of Euclids firſt Booke of Elements called▪ becauſe of the hardneſſe thereof to yong beginners.,or Bricke wall. For (as yee haue heard) it is written not onely in the Bible; but in the booke of the world too; where are no Turkiſh Characters, no Hebrew points, no Greeke manuſcript Abbreviations to trouble you: much leſſe any multitude of Lines, or Angles to diſharten you. Only, One Day Telleth another.
            
            Of which that we may the better bee informed, &amp; our liues thereby (if it pleaſe GOD to diſpenſe vnto vs ſo large a meaſure of his grace) amended and reformed: May it pleaſe you to obſerue with me, but two or three things.
            
               First, what is The meaning of theſe words, One Day 
                
               Telleth another. where yee ſhal perceaue what is meant by The Daies, and what by their Telling one another. Or if yee liſt to divide this Firſt Generall Part into two: The Firſt ſhall be of the Meaning of the words. The Second, 
                of The Maner of the Daies Telling one another, The Maner of their Speech.
            
            The Third, how ever the laſt Generall part ſhal be,  
               The Matter, The Subiect, or, The Subſtāce of their Speech.
            
            The word of Exhortation ſhall not lie in an heape

together: but, like vnto ſalt, ſhall here and there bee ſprinkled, as need ſhall ſeeme moſt to require; that ſo the whole may the better be ſeaſoned.
            The Laſt Generall part, becauſe this time will not bee ſufficient to treate of, and yet it behoueth you to haue ſome precognition thereof: It ſhall ſuffice (beſides that which hath beene ſaid of The Knowledge of GOD) to tell you that it is, The Glory of GOD; That which The Heavens are ſaid to declare in the firſt verſe of this Pſalme: And The Handy worke of GOD; That which The Firmament is there ſaid to Shew. The Heavens declare the glory of God, and the Firmament ſheweth his handy worke.
            
            And ſo much the leſſe need ſhall there be of ſaying any more vnto you hereof at this time, becauſe wee ſhall often make mention of it, by occaſion of that, which (if GOD will) now, and hereafter ere long bee; ſhall be ſaid of the other two parts. Such being The Glory of GOD, as that it cannot but ſhew it ſelfe in all things, and is indeed the maine intendment of this whole deſigne.
            
               Part. 1.Now then firſt, as concerning the firſt Generall part, The Meaning of theſe words, One Day Telleth another.
            
            Where firſt, I thinke it convenient to deliver vnto you three or foure Literall Expoſitions of theſe words.
            The firſt whereof (vnleſſe you thinke it to appertaine to an Allegoricall, or elſe a Mixt Senſe) is collected out of the 9, 10, and 11. Chapters of the Epiſtle

to the Romanes, conferred eſpecially with the foure firſt verſes of this Pſalme. The laſt whereof is expreſlie cited in the 18. verſe of the tenth Chapter: the ſecond (where the words of my Text) is (according to this Expoſition) implyed in the 21. verſe, in thoſe words 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

The Meaning may receiue this Augmentation: Namely, One Day] of Salvation, whether of Iewes or Gentiles, iointly or ſeverally: One Accepted Time, One Day] of Hearing GODS voice: One Day] whether of the wilde, or Naturall Branches: One Day] of their partaking of the Roote, and Fatneſſe of the Oliue tree: One Day] of their Election,

Vocation, Engraffing, Admittance into the nūber of GODS people, His Beloved, Children of the Living GOD, veſſels of Honour and of Glory. Againe, One Day] of Caſting away the one or the other, through their Vnbeliefe and Diſobedience: One Day] of their Reiection, their being Blinded &amp; Enſlumbered, that they ſhould not See nor Heare vnto This Day (Rom. 11. 8.) One Day] of Bowing downe their Backs Alway, of their Fall, &amp; of their Loſſe. Yet againe: One Day] of their Recovery, if they abide not ſtill in vnbeliefe. One Day] of their Reelection, or Recollection, Recalling, Reconciling, Reengraffing, Readmitting, Revniting, and Repleniſhing: vntill in proceſſe

               , and one Shepheard. Finally: One Day] of any of GODS Mercies, or Iudgements, towards Iewes or Gentiles, towards Iewes and Gentiles, towards All people of the world: One Day] of The Goodneſſe &amp; Severity of GOD (Rom. 11. 22.) Whether iointly or ſeverally, toward this or that people, in all and every reſpect, conſidered: vntill we come to, O the Depth of the Riches of the wiſedome and Knowledge of God, &amp;c: Telleth] to make That Depth the Greater, Pſal. 42. 9.
               and as it were One Deepe calling another; vnto Another Day] of like condition, The Glory of GOD: concluding as S. Paul doth the 11. Chapter to the Romanes, &amp; as we do this Expoſition, To whom be Glory for Ever. Amen.
            
                The Second Expoſition is gathered out of the Title, 
                or Inſcription of this Pſalme. The Third out of the firſt and ſecond Chapters of Geneſis compared with  the ſixe firſt verſes of this Pſalme. The Fourth is Saint Auſtins.
            
            
               
For the Second; I am not ignorant, that (what with  the diverſe ſignifications of the prefixes in Hebrew, 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                and 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , and of the Hebrew word 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , and what with ſomething in this Pſalme contained ſeeming to ſound to th' advancement of each Senſe) this Pſalme hath his Title much like vnto the Text that I haue read vnto you; that is, much diverſified with variety of Senſes, and of Interpretations. But the beſt of all (for the Title) I take to bee that of Iunius and Tremellius; (which they haue from Abraham Ezra, &amp; David Kimbi, the two See Bucers Preface vpon the Pſalmesbeſt of al the Rabbins) and it is, Magiſtro Symphoniae Pſalmus Davidis, The Pſalme of David to the master of the ſinging, or, the master of the quire. That which Avenarius 
               In Lexic. in verbo, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
               alſo, but with more explication, hath delivered: Continuanti in Canticis Pſalmus Davidis, the Pſalme of David to him that continueth on the ſinging in the church, that is, Hic Pſalmus (ſaith he) exhibitus est praefecto cantorum, qui continuabat &amp; vrgebat, vt is aſſidue ſuo tempore &amp; ordine decantaretur, This Pſalme was exhibited, or, tendred to the maſter of the ſingers, who did vrge the continuall ſinging of it from day to day in his due time &amp; order. And this too is moſt agreeable to the Greek, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , if it be rightly vnderſtood.
            This I needed not perchance to haue ſpoken vnto you; but that, as our Saviour by the image and ſuperſcription of the money ſhewed to whom the tribute belonged, and as the Rubricke doth ſomething availe to the better vnderſtanding of the Blacke (as they call it:) ſo the Title &amp; Inſcription of this Pſalme may ſome

thing helpe vs to a good ſenſe and meaning of theſe words, which out of the Pſalme I haue read vnto you. For according to the Title in that beſt interpretation, one meaning of theſe words may be. That One Day in the Church, One Day of ſinging in the Church, One Day of reading in the Church, yea and of reading too theſe Pſalmes of David in the Church, according as they are divided by ſome Itain Pſalter. Arabic.into 20. by others Ita Eccleſia noſtra inſtituit legendos, iuxta numerum dierum menſis.into 30. Daies of reading them. One Day of praying in the Church, One Day of Gods ſervice in the Church, recounteth vnto another day of like ſort, or otherwiſe, the Glory of GOD. The ſervice and worſhip of GOD being by this meanes continued ſtill in the Church, his name continually magnified, and the glory of his name ſpread farre and neere, by the report of what is done every day in the Church.
            So (not to ſpeake of Hiram king of Tyrus 
               1 King. 57., and others) ſo came vnto the Queene of Sheba the fame of Solomon, concerning the name of the Lord, as t'is expreſſed 1. King. 10. 1. And herevpon ſhee came, and bleſſed the Lord GOD of Solomon, as t'is ſaid in the ninth verſe. So, I pray GOD, may the fame of King IAMES concerning the name of the Lord, be conveyed to the Turks &amp; Infidels, and to the vtmoſt parts of the world, that ſo (if GOD will) they may be wonne to bleſſe the Lord God of our godly King and Soveraigne. So King David made ſuch great and royall proviſion for the ſervice of GOD, 1. Chr. 25. And in the two &amp; fortieth Pſalme, and elſe where ſo often, hee expreſſeth his fervent deſire

to haue the worſhip and ſervice of GOD daily obſerued in the Church. Nay, ſo king Solomon built a houſe for the Name of the Lord GOD of Iſrael, 1. King. 8. 20. Which too to build (as t'is in the 18. ver.) was in the heart of king Dauid, And he did dwell, that he was ſo minded. So minded: That ſo from day to day, as it were by One Daies Report vnto anrther, the worſhip and Glory of GOD might be as farre, as farre may be, dilated &amp; extended, even vnto the ends of the world.
            This, (what ſay I this?) the daily ſervice of GOD in Churches, the rites and ceremonies, the riches and ſolemnities, the royaltie and magnificence therein vſed, to haue been alwaies very ſingular meanes of the advancement of the Glory of the moſt glorious, and the holy worſhip of the holieſt? Yea truely, Beloued; and that in Chriſtianitie, and when it fared but hard with Chriſtians, nor had they ſuch peace &amp; plentie, ſo many well munited kingdomes of their owne, as now they haue. I report me but to the ſmalleſt inſight in hiſtory. Let Titus be excepted, for being ſo much moved, as Ioſephus 
               
                  De bello Iudaico lib. 7. c 4. 9. 10.reporteth, with the Temple at Ieruſalem. And let be vnreckoned in like caſe Coſröe, 
               Vide Gulielmum Tyrium, Bell. Sacrili. 1.
               
               Aar, and Daber, kings of Perſia. And let thoſe who therewithall leaſt of all were moved, moue forwarde this cauſe moſt of all. For Vide Gulielmum Tyrium, Bell. Sacrili. 1.
                
               Hequin of the Perſians &amp; the like, when they ſaw that Chriſtianity encreaſed, as they thought, too faſt; then began they to look more narrowly to the Temples of the Chriſtians, then to inhibite Vide Gulielmum Tyrium, Bell. Sacrili. 1.
                them the vſe of their accuſtomed ſolemnities, yea and to conſtraine them vpon thoſe daies, in

which the worſhip and ſervice of GOD ſhould haue beene celebrated with moſt magniſicence, to keepe them within Vide Gulielmum Tyrium, Belli Sacri li 1.
               the doores of their houſes, vpon paine and perill of their liues. Laſtly, when all this would not ſerue then downe tumbled they the Temples thē. ſelues, the Temple of the Reſurrection Vide Gulielmum Tyrium, Belli Sacri li 1.
               , and the like; According to the old policie of Nabuchodonoſor; Antiochus Epiphanes 
               Mac

                  abeor. lib. 1. &amp; 2.
               , and others. So laboured they as mnch as in them lay, to barre the Dayes telling one another, by this meanes, the Glory of GOD. So endeavoured they to make the Day more ſilent then the Night; the night, becauſe they loued darkneſſe more then light.
            Oh then, Beloued, if not the deſire of the hallowing of GODS name (which ought to be the firſt in our deſires) may moue you to provide diligently, yea and (as much as in you lieth) magnificently too, for the daily ſervice of GOD, and your every daies frequēting of it: yet let the Day your daily Orator, &amp; (if you will) your Orator too, either perſwade you therevnto, or elſe beg ſo much at your hands: that you would be ſo good as to countenance his Report with your preſence, enrich it with your preſents vnto GOD, beautifie 
                  Phyſ. lib. 2. c. 6 context. 59.it with your holineſſe, and make it happie by your ſerving of GOD. For if Protarchꝰ (as Ariſtotle relateth) ſaid that the Altar-ſtones were happie; may I not much more account that Day happy, wherein GOD himſelfe is honoured? And if the fervent deſire of the creature waiteth, when the ſonnes of GOD ſhall be revealed (Rom. 8. 19.) hath it not a fervent deſire alſo of his owne felicitie?

And when is the Daies beſt happineſſe, but when the true Dieſpiter (the true GOD, whoſe is the Day and the Night) ſhall be moſt highly honoured? Let then your zeale and aſſiduitie in the worſhip and ſervice of GOD, make that One Day may make vnto another the more ample and honourable Report of GODS glory. For which purpoſe I exhort every one of you, as S. Paule doth the Epheſians, and the Coloſſians, that you Epheſ. 5. Col 3.would ſpeake vnto one another, that you would teach one another, that you would exhort and admoniſh one another, that you would ſtirre vp, put one another in mind, (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) by Pſalmes, and Hymns, and ſpirituall ſongs, 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                (ſinging with, and without Inſtruments) And 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , (ſinging with a comely and graceful kind of thankſgiving) 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                (in your hearts, in your ſtrongeſt affections) vnto the Lord. And let me ſay vnto every ſoule, as Prudentius prudently ſaith to his owne ſoule in the Preface of his booke 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               :
            
               Saltem Voce Deum concelebret, ſi meritis nequit.
               Hymnis continuet dies;
            
            Nec nox vlla vacet, quin Dominum canat. At leaſt wiſe let vs beſtowe our voices, ſounds and voices, vpon the Lord, and vpon the celebration of his praiſes, if wee will afford him nothing elſe. Let vs like Rectors of the quire of the Dayes, continue on their Telling one another, their chaunting, and recounting the Glory of GOD, by our Pſalmes, our Hymnes, and ſpirituall ſongs. And that ſo much the rather, becauſe (as Theodoret noteth on the words of my Text, according as he is tranſlated) wee men are here
               
taught, illi (Deo) hymnorum catilenam afferre, to bring and offer vnto God ſongs and hymnes of praiſes, &amp; thankfulneſse; We, I ſay, are here taught it, even by this one Days Telling another. One Day telleth another.
            The Third Meaning is ſuch, as that (according to the Infinite variety of GODS works, and of the Glorie which he conferreth on them) it maketh The Dayes ſo to Multiply their words, That therby The Report of Gods Glory Infinitely paſſeth through the Treaſures of the Deepe, doth Infinitly Grow, and Spring, and Creepe, and Goe, and Swim, and Fly: and Fly Vnder, and Aboue the Heauens: doth Infinitly Moue, and Liue, &amp; Liue for Euer. And this Meaning is, that every of the Six daies wherein GOD made the world, The Seaventh day alſo wherein he reſted, do One declare vnto another the Glory of GOD. Thoſe, by all the Workes which in any of them were created; This, by GODS Reſting in it and Sanctifying of it. So haue S. Ambroſe, Chryſoſtome, and Baſill, (in their 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               .) And ſo hath that divine Poet, Seigneur du Bartas, with a gift of excellencie, handled each one of thoſe Daies; that well they haue made it to appeare that each of them may lend to other, each and all of them may lend to vs (though they lend vs too) infinit and vnſpeakable, though ever ſpoken, matter of GODS Glory. And in this reſpect Bodin ſpeaketh very well▪ (towards th' end of the firſt Chapter of his firſt booke De Republica) Deus Opt.

Where, beſides the bleſſednes by GOD himſelfe beſtowed on that Day, which is beſtowed on his ſervice, (that which before we ſpake of, and is expreſly proved out of the beginning of the ſecond of Geneſis) This is alſo a thing of very ſingular note, That not only the ſix daies of Gods working (I ſay not The Workes only that GOD made in the ſix daies, but the ſix daies of GODS Working▪) haue taught man 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                and 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                too; (as Ariſtotle hath diſtinguiſhed them in his ſixth booke of Ethicks, and the fourth Chapter.) But the Seauenth Day hath learned him Vid. de la Nowe vb, ſuprd
               Contemplation alſo; And this to be the Endc of all trades and occupations, of all arts and ſciences, of all affaires &amp; negotiations, both civill and domeſticall; Even vpon the Sabbath Day, to keepe it holy, to enioy our reſt with reioycing in the Lord, &amp; in pulcherrima Dei praepotentis opera, iudicia, iuſſa intuentes, in eius laudibus acquieſcere: and by contemplating the beautifull Workes of GOD; his iudgements, and his commandements, to reſt and reappoſe our ſelues wholy on the magnifying of GODS name; caſting away from vs euery thing that preſſeth downe (as the Apoſtle Heb. 12. 1.ſpeaketh) &amp; the ſin that hangeth ſo faſt on vs. That ſo at the leaſt once in the week, we may be foūd reſting and reſiding in our proper Element without any worldly gravitation.
            This the Heathen men had ſome glimmering of: And therefore, how ever they derided

               Faſtus erit per quem lege licebit agi. And all this learned they by the ſound of the Sabbath Day. The ſound of the Sabbath Day, which had gone out into all lands, according to that which is in the next verſe ſaue one vnto my Text.
            S. Chryſoſtome in the tenth Homilie of his

               , ſaith he, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               .
            If then, Beloved, it were one of the firſt Items that ever GOD gaue vs, if the law of Nature hath taught it vs, if the Day it ſelfe, even this Day, ſo long agoe, and now ſo long time together, hath told it vs, if it be the Expetible End of all our actions, the ſoveraigne Felicity of this life, To dedicate ſome Whole Day in the week to the worſhip and ſervice of GOD, and to the workes that are ſpirituall; Ought we not, ought we not ſo to doe? Though it had never beene expreſly written in the ten commandements. For, One Day telleth another.

            In the next place, it ſhall not be amiſſe, if we firſt of all examine the very wordes themſelues, what they may ſignifie in the Original, conferred too with other languages.
            They are in the Hebrew, 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . Where all the difference is about the ſignification of the prefixe 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , and of the word 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . for 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                being a note either of the Genitiue or Datiue caſe, and ſometimes too by the prepoſition De, or, Ad to be expounded: Hence ſome haue vnderſtood 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                in this place, as if it were to be interpreted by the prepoſition De. So

               Kimhi hath taken it: as if we ſhould read it thus, One Day telleth of another. And then the meaning is, That One Day ſheweth another day in like ſort to follow after him, and that there ſhall be the ſame reaſon of the ſubſequent, as was of the precedent day; The Sun ſtill continuing on his goodly order and viciſſitude of riſing and ſetting.
            
               So hath One Day told another the Glory of GOD, and hath made him knowne, not in Iſraël only, but vnto all people. Hence Cicero De Nat. Deorum lib. 2.
               
               could ſay: Diet noctiſ

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) with like meaning vnto that of Kimhies; and, that One Day deriueth his knowledge vnto another Day, one Day maketh report

of another Daies adventures, and looke what is done to day we ſhall heare of it another Day.
            A third ſort (and they the moſt, and the moſt approved) vnderſtand here the Datiue Caſe, or (which is all one in meaning) the Accuſatiue with the Prepoſition Ad. Dies die
                     •
                  , or, Dies ad Diem. One Day telleth another, or, telleth to, or vnto another.
            
            Of this laſt ſort, ſome are of opinion, that ſome thing ought here to be ſupplyed; as if by the Day telling another were ſtrictly to be vnderſtood, The Day ſucceeding the other Verum rectius ſine ſubintellectione hic verſus accipitur, ſaith Ianſenius in his Annotations. And indeed, there is ſo much the leſſe need of ſubaudition; becauſe there is a word here 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                (ſignifying a word) expreſſed. And however This Day, declaring the Glory of his Maker, ſhal ſo ſoone, as ſoone at night, leaue of any more to be: yet ſhall not GODS Glory therewith all leaue off any more to bee declared by it. For this day ſpeaketh a Word to the ſucceeding day, (The Day telleth 
               Like to Pag▪ nines Eloquitur, hereafter enſuing, and Mollers Eloquitur &amp; Teſtatur.
               
               out to the Day a Word, as one Engliſh manuſcript Tranſlation In New Colledge Library.very well hath) and in a ſort deriveth, transfuſeth, tranſmiſeth, yea dying bequeatheth as a legacy to his ſucceſſour, the ever ſucceeding predication of GODS praiſes. No otherwiſe, then as by our late Queene of famous memory, though ſhee be dead, yet GOD is ever magnified, becauſe of her Succeſſour hauing as great a care of the ſetting forth of GODS Glory as ever ſhe had. One Day Telleth another.
            
            And were it not more out of order, then t'is out of due time; I would here take occaſion to exhort every

one of you by the Dayes, even This Dayes, example; to endeavour to leaue behind you, when you bee dead &amp; gon, ſome monument of your owne, though it be but a good name; (and that is better then a good ointment, Eccleſiaſtes, 7. 3. and to bee choſen aboue great riches,, Prov. 22. 1.) I ſay, ſome monument or other, of GODS Glory. Even as yon ſee this Day our late Soveraigne, though ſhee haue left no monument behinde her, as ſome ſuppoſe: yet hath ſhe left a name and a famous memoriall behind her, ſo that her praiſe ſhall bee ſpokē of, by One Dayes telling another. Yea and, for a monument, ſhe hath left vs a great emolument: I mentiō not the Statute of Proviſion, but the free and golden current of the Goſpell, and that great monument of GODS Glory, her moſt honourable ſucceſſour.
            This might teach vs to provide, at leaſt in our laſt wils, for that which our former wills ſo much neglect, and for which it was that GOD gaue vs any will at all; even the ſetting forth of the honour, and Glory of his heavenly Maieſtie. Conſidering that (beſides the godly examples of holy men of old) the Day alſo, as yong as it is, taketh all his care for bequeathing of this one and only thing to his ſucceſſour, and for admoniſhing his heire apparant of this thing, even when he is neereſt to the Night of his death. For Dies moritur in noctem, &amp; tenebris vſquequa

            For our Engliſh Telleth; the originall hath

               . One Day Apponeth, or, Addeth vnto another. Of which: Non video, ſaith Bucer, quid ſibi voluerit, quod Diei Appoſitionem tribuit, niſi forſan intellexerit, Diē nova Dei ſemper opera exh

               But for the Hebrew and Arabian words: It is firſt to be noted, that according to them both wee may here read, One Day ſhall tell another. For

Which Adding, or Apponing of the Impulſiue Cauſe here imployed, I take (to appone my coniecture in a caſe ſo doubtfull) to be the Cauſe of the word of Adding, or, Apponing vſed in the Chalde Tranſlation, as even now ye heard; Bucers Cōiecture for the Meaning being herevnto alſo conſonant and agreeing.
            
            
               
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                The Arabian word, Twiſe In the Imprinted copy of Nebienſis.Read in this verſe, is likewiſe in the Future Tenſe; Although with the Arabians the Future and the Preſent Tenſe be contained both in one (being otherwiſe diſtinguiſhed.) As alſo the Hebrew Future Tenſe is ſometimes taken for, or, to comprehend in it the Preſent Tenſe, or, Time: when as there is ſignified a Continuall Act. It is alſo put for the Preter perfect Tenſe, and ſomewhiles too for the Optatiue, or Potentiall Moode. Yea the Hebrew Future Tenſe (as one Bertram▪
               ſaith) putteth on the ſignifications of All other Tenſes, of what Moode &amp; Lāguage ſoever they be: Shewing it ſelfe herein a right Proteus, that is, Heavenly Deſcended, &amp; no Changling for his Chāgeablenes: as though it had this Motto; Tempora mutātur, &amp; nos mutamur in Illa. Tenſes, or Times are Changed, and I the Future am changed into the habite of the Reſt.
            
            So that it, being Formed too from the Imperatiue As is alſo the Aramick.Mood, is as it were a rich Paludamēt, or Coat Armour;
               
in which The Dayes are clad, and inveſted the Embaſſadours, or Heraults at Armes, to Proclaime through out Al Times The Report of the Glory of that great Commaunding Lord and Emperour of the Heavens; out of whoſe Imperatiue, All Times, together with All their Maners and Differences are Formed and Created.

               Which I take to be the cauſe, why diverſe here, in their Tranſlating, do as yet retaine, with vs, the preſēt Tenſe. See hereafter the obſervation of Iunius and Trem. &amp; Moller, &amp;c.and that Which I take to be the cauſe, why diverſe here, in their Tranſlating, do as yet retaine, with vs, the preſēt Tenſe. See hereafter the obſervation of Iunius and Trem. &amp; Moller, &amp;c.
               Continually, Tell another.
            
            
               Againe: One Day not onely Doth, but Shall Tell another of GODS Glory; Shall, &amp; Doth. Doth, in that it Shall: and Shall, in that it Doth: Doeth, and Shall: and therefore Hath told too. For, what is it that Hath beene? That that Shall be; and what is it that hath beene done? That which Shall be done: and there is no New thing vnder the Sunne. Is there any thing whereof one may ſay, Beholde this, it is New? It Hath beene already in the old time before vs. Eccleſ. 1. ver. 9. 10. And aske we but of the Heathen men, concerning what One Day telleth another, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                Iom le Iom, Arab. &amp; vide Cald. ſupra.Iaumi Or, Li.
               le laumin. They will ſay, Nullum eſt Iam dictum, quod non fit dictum Terent. in Prolog. Eunuc.prius. Seneca in his twelfth Epiſtle, expounding that ſame 
               Of Heracletus., Vnus Dies par omni eſt, One Day is as good as every Day, or, One Day is equall vnto every Day; maketh one meaning of it to be, Parem eſse vnum diem omnibus ſimilitudine. Nihil enim habet longiſſimi temperis ſpatium, quod nō in vno die invenias, lucem &amp; noctem, &amp; alternas mundi vices. There is nothing (ſaith he) in the longeſt ſpace of time, which you may not finde couched within the compaſſe of one Day (hee

vnderſtands the Day Naturall) light and night, &amp; the enterchangeable courſes and alternities of worldly things. As if the preſent Day, the preſent Time, did ſerue for nothing elſe, but to combine the former. Glory of his Maker, with that that is to come, and ſo to make his praiſe to be continuall.
            
            
                Secondly, we may attend the proper and fruitfull ſignification of the Hebrew, &amp; Arabick, by their Roots.
            
               The Roote of the Hebrew is, 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , ſcaturivit, exvndavit, to iſſue or flow forth. Whence is made the word here vſed, ſignifying, to ſpeake fluently, or currently. An ordinary Metaphore (as yee know) with Cicero, Quintilian, and others the beſt for Elocution. One Day ſpeaketh Fluently vnto another. Sine haeſitatione, (as Moller here ſpeaketh) without any ſtop or stay, without any ſtuttering or ſtammering, with great celerity &amp; volubility of ſpeech. Even like vnto the Sunne in the 5. and 6. verſes of this Pſalme, which commeth forth as a bridegrome out of his chamber, and Reioyceth, as a Gyant, to Runne his courſe.
            
               Ier. 48. 10.Here they that doe the worke of the Lord negligently, they that doe it at halues, may learne to doe it more thoroughly, more readily, with greater alacrity, and with greater induſtry. For (alas) may it not be applyed even to many a ones Preaching now a daies, which the heathen Cic. de Orat. lib. 1.
               Orator hath of his own profeſſion? Atqui vide in artificio per quàm tenui; &amp; levi, quantò plus adhibeatur diligentiae, quàm in ha
                     •
                  re, quam conſta
                     •
                  eſſe maximam. See how many times there is much more diligence vſed in ſome young ſchollers declamation, then is in

a whole and entire Sermon; ſo graund a proclamation as it ſhould be, of GODS praiſes. Yea many times there is much more exactneſſe &amp; curioſity vſed in ſome vile and baſe artifice, then is in this; which yet for ſooth we hold to bee the greateſt exerciſe of all. One Day telleth another. And this Telling is a Preaching; (as directly out of the Rom 10Apoſtle I could proue vnto Et vide in ſe quentibus multa huc ſpectantia.you.) And this Preaching is according to the lawes of perfect Oratory. O how, my thinkes, the very law of nature, or rather the GOD of nature hath inſtructed the Daies both naturall &amp; Artificiall, to Preach the Glory of GOD; according to the lawes, naturall ſhall I ſay or artificiall, of perfect Oratory. For, as if they were, ita ornati, vt non nati, ſed à Deo ipſo fictifacti
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   eſſe videantur; 
               Ita ferè Cic de Orat. lib. 1.
               So, ſo, One Day telleth another.
            
            Many in this place haue much affected to render the word 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                by ſome worde ſignifying Eructation, or Belching, or that which is more homely. Hence the vulgar Latin hath, Eructat verbum; the newer Spaniſh Tranſlation, Reguelda palabra; the French alſo, Deſgorge propos. All theſe thinking that the metaphore had bin here taken from a full stomacke; (ex plenitudine ventris, as Caietane here ſpeaketh) which indeede is taken from the guſhing or flowing out of water out of his ſource or fountaine. And therefore t'is but needfull, which to this effect the French Annotation here hath vpon the word, deſgorge. So hath the prophet David elſewhere vſed the word 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               : as Pſal. 119. the thirde verſe of the laſt letter, My lips ſhall ſpeake of thy praiſe, or (according to the Originall) ſhall power forth plentifully

thy praiſe. So here alſo, by One Dayes telling another, is meant, That One Day powreth forth Abundantly vnto another. Their Good meaning, who Tranſlate by Eructation, being here alſo to be found: namely, That Every Day is Superabundantly Full of GODS praiſe, a Full of words, or Matter 
               Iob. 32. 18., and according to that Fulneſſe, doth plentifully vtter and vent out his Laudatorie Speech; And their Tranſlating being ſo much the more laudable, and concording with this other, if by Eructation there be vnderſtood, Fountaine, or, River-Eructation.
            
            
               This is very well obſerved here by Bucer vpon the word 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . Eructare vertere ſolent (ſaith hee) &amp; id nonnunquam ſignificat: ſed ad Sermonem ſignificandum inde Tranſlatum eſt, quod propriè Scaturire ſignificat, Sermo enim ex ore, vt Rivus è Fonte ebullit.
            Hence Munſter commeth neere vnto the Originall, when he Tranſlateth here Influit. And ſo doth Pagnine putting here, Eloquitur, inſteed of Eructat. Like vnto our Engliſh and Scottiſh, One Day Telleth another: or, (as others Tranſlate) One Day Vttereth &amp;c. Which conſpiteth alſo with the Italian, Raconta la parola, and with the Spaniſh, 
               In the ſignification of Speaking: as our Engliſh word (Tale) ſignifieth with thoſe of Saxonie and Belgica: yea and with vs too, when, interrupting one in his Speech, we ſay: Sauing your Tale,
               Fabla dicho, in the Ferrariam Editiō; yea and with the Greeke too. For ſo alſo 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                ſometimes ſignifieth, eſpecially if it haue ſuch a worde as 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , or 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , ioyned with it: as here, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . Iunius and Tremellius obſerue here a farther note (though not farther then afore Where, among other things, of Cōtinuation of Doing, gathered out of the Future tenſe, in which the Preſēt Tenſe is Involved.hath beene intimated:) that which the French Annotations alſo haue, and is agreeable to that which is in the 5th and 6th verſes of this

Pſalme. Eructat (ſay they). i. indeſinentèr profundit, vt Fons perennis aquas profundit largitèr. Largiter, &amp; Indeſinentèr. Both theſe are here alſo obſerved by Moller. Eructat (ſaith he) id eſt, Copioſe &amp; Aſſiduè Eloquitur &amp; Teſtatur, &amp;c. Where by the way wee may lay hold on the word Teſtatur, to enrich &amp; countenance the Days Telling, with his Teſtifying, like vnto the Nights Certifying. One Day Telleth, Certifieth, and Teſtifieth vnto another] Abundantly and Indeſinently.
            
            To theſe two may bee added a Third Obſervation. For Water doth alſo Bubble, or make ſome purling Noiſe even at the ſpring head. And ſo doe the Dayes in their parling one with another: as hereafter (GOD willing) ſhall more at large bee declared, when wee ſhall come to ſpeake of The Manner of their Speech. This is that which the Greeke too, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , leadeth vs vnto, rather then to Tranſlate it by Eructuatiō. For 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                (as hath beene ſaid) doth not alwaies ſignifie Eructuare, or, Eructare; but ſometimes too, Fremere, Strepere, to keepe a Noiſe, or a Ruſtling. So that of Homer, 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , is interpreted by,

               . And this ſignification is very agreeable to that which followeth in the two next verſes vnto my Text: There is neither Speech nor Language, but their voices are Heard among them. Their ſound is gone out into all Lands &amp;c. Their Sound, their Voices▪
                or, the ſound of Gods voices ſpeaking by them. According to that of Leo: 
               Leo Serm. 8. de Ieiun. X. menſis. cap 2.
               
               Ipſius voces in Die, ipſius audiuntur in Nocte, &amp;c: Gods voices are heard ſpeaking vnto vs by the Day, and by the Night.
            
            
               
So then, One Day Noyſeth, and Soundeth vnto another, and that Indeſinently, and that too Plentifully, His Glory, who is plentifull in his Goodneſſe towardes all his creatures.
            Ought then our mouth either to bee Silent in Gods praiſes, or elſe Sparefull, or elſe ever weary of ſo wel doing? for, One Day Telleth another.
            
            
               The Roote of the Hebrew hath alſo certaine Coſens, or Allies, which will helpe vs to ſome Intelligence, touching the Ample Meaning of The Report, that by The Dayes is made in this place. Two of them, &amp; they the Neereſt (for I will not trouble you with any more of the Kindred) are 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                (To Draw, or cauſe to come out, to get and come to the knowledge of a thing by ſome other:) &amp; 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                (to Foretell, to Prophecie, or Preach.) According to the firſt, The Meaning may be alſo: One Day ſhal provoke, (as before you heard) One Day ſhall Draw, or get Knowledge out of another: One Day ſhall pike, ſearch, Sift, or fiſh out ſomething, out of another, or, more then another: One still to and of another enterchangeably Giuing and Taking, Adding and Receiuing more and more Revealed Knowledge and Information. According to the later, This alſo may bee Meant: One Day will Foretell, Preach, or Prophecie vnto another; One Day will Evangelize, will vtter the Goſpell, or Parables of God, vnto another: According vnto that, 
               Mat. 13 35 Pſal. 78. 2. &amp; 49. 5.I will open my Mouth, in Parables, I will vtter the things which haue beene kept ſecret, &amp;c. Agreeably alſo to that preaching of the Goſpell, mentioned, Rom. 10. v. 14, 15.

               The Roote, or Theme, of the Arabian, is parted into two Boughes, or Branches of Signification. Which (for 
               Vpō the pointing or vowclling whereof, I dare not as yet adventure, vnleſſe I ſhould doe it vpon coniecture: as much elſe is in the Arabian; The rather, becauſe of the paucitie of pointed or vowelled Books: &amp; for want of a cō
                  pleat punctuated Arabian Dictionary: with which that Divine-Linguiſt, and moſt skilfull in the Arabicke, M William Bedwell, is richly furniſhed. It is to bee wiſhed, that the charges of the Imprinting of that, or the like, and other good Arabian Bookes, and of forming Types and Characters for that purpoſe, might by ſome Heroically minded be ſupported. It would be an excellent meanes of the Advancement of the Common weale of Learning and Chriſtianitie It would the rather cauſe the Kings of Arabia to bring Gifts (Pſal. 72. 10.) not only Philoſophicall, Phyſicall, and Rhetoricall (with which among others, E. vax, that learned King of Arabia was enriched) but of Divinitie and Chriſtianitie too, and of the Gold of Arabia, to wit, continual) praying vnto Chriſt, and dayly praiſing of him (Pſal, 72. 15) In a word, It would be a Mite, wel befitting the Might of a King, to caſt into the Earthly Treaſurie of The Daies Report of the Glory of The Almightie.
               want of Garments, The Gold of Arabia, or Richer Matter, to ſpread in the way,) we of the poorer ſort of Chriſts ſervants will vſe as the people did the Branches, (Mat. 21. 8.) which they cut downe from the trees, and ſtrawed in the way of our Saviour. Thereby the better to decke and adorne, though with ſuch ſlight ſtuffe, The Dayes Report of Gods Glory, and to Cry out to Him in the End, Hoſanna in the Higheſt.
            
               One of thoſe Branches of Signification, is like vnto that of the Hebrew Roote it ſelfe afore ſpoken of; namely, To Iſſue, or Flow out, as out of a Fountaine, to Spring, to Ariſe, to Sprout, and (that which perchance is from the Arabick) to Bud forth. Alſo, to Shew, or to Declare.
            
               The other is: to Begin, to Ariſe, to take Ariſing, or Beginning; alſo, to Be the Beginning, or Ariſing.
            
               Now according herevnto; One Day Doth, or Shall Flow out, Spring, or Ariſe, Bud forth, Shew and Declare To and Of Another.
            
               Againe: One Day Doth Begin, taketh Beginning, is a

Beginning, Of and To Another.
            
               Here are Buds and Bloſſomes of Gods Glory. Here are Sweet Sources and Ariſings, Springs and Flowings, Shews and Declarations of Gods Glory: proceeding from The Roote of the Tongue of the Dayes Telling; Telling &amp; Teaching vs, That our Tongues ſhould be a Fountaine of Sweet, and not of Bitter Things. For you would alſo thinke, that The Day had a Licoriſh Tongue, or at leaſtwiſe a Mellifluous, if yee knew how many Sweet Things it Telleth of. His Eructatiō 
               being not only of the Sweets of Creation, but of Moſt prudent and provident Conſervation, Preſervation, Gubernation; yea and of the Choiceſt of all others: Election, Vocation, Redemption, Sanctification, Iustification, Glorification. So many Sweet Verbals Derived from One Primitiue Word of God, by the Deepe Chanell of the Dayes Verboſity.
            
               Where among other things Flowing out, the Dayes Tongue beiug Well Liquored, are whole Seas and Rivers of Corporall, and of Spirituall Vid. Act. 2. &amp; Ioel. 2.Effuſion.
            Where among other Buds, are Bodies: among other Springs, are Spirits: among other Ariſings, are Riſing &amp; Raiſing vp of Dead Bodies, (whereof hereafter:) &amp; among other things that ſhoot and ſpring forth, and that without ſtinting, are, or is: The Roote of Ieſſe, the Tree, and Water of Life.
            
            But All, one among another, are (as hereafter in the Subiect yee ſhall heare) All Things.
            
            
               But One Aboue All other Things, is: that Riſing vp of that Ieſus-Root of Ieſſe. Againe: Here is that that Doth Begin, That that Takes Beginning, and That that Is Beginning

to Another.
            
               How thē can he but be here, That is, the Beginning to All Other? How can His Birth both Temporall and Eternal, but Sprout out of this fruitfull Wombe of the Day, yea and of the 
                  Vid Pſal. 110 3.Morning, the Firſt and Chiefest part of the Day: eſpecially that Firſt and Chiefest Eternal Birth of him, who is the Firſt, and Chiefeſt, and Aeternall Day?
            
               When as here are ſo Many Generations, &amp; Corruptions, Generating the praiſe of his Incorruptible Generoſity and Eternal Generation: So much, Light &amp; Night, Iſſue, as it were Male &amp; Female, ſo much Ofſpring of the Day and of the Darkneſſe, by The ſpirit of God Moving vpon the face of the Water (Gen. 1. 1.) So many ſpirits Flowing from the Father of All ſpirits: So many Beings Ariſing from the Fountaine of All Being: So many things, that of themſelues Are not that they Are, but in and through him, who of himſelfe Is that He Is, and Ever Is, and was, and ſhall be that He Is: when as nothing Is without Reſpect of the Diffuſion of His Goodneſſe, without Reference to the Raiſing of His power, and without Dependencie from Him, who Dependeth of no other but Himſelfe:
            Becauſe we may not place Him in any Other, wee muſt needes put him ſtill in the Predicament of Relation of his owne praiſes.
            
            Now (Right Worſhipfull, and all alike well Beloved in Chriſt Ieſus) let it not be, tedious vnto you, a little more to make you acquainted▪ or elſe to renew your acquaintance, with the variety of Interpretations

               .
            
               Some vnderſtand theſe words Allegorically; As if by One Dayes telling another were meant, that Chriſt told his Apoſtles: or, (as others haue) Sapiens Sapienti, Sancti Sanctis, Electi Electis, Chriſtiani Chriſtianis: and, vnder the Nights Certifying, Iudaei Iudaeis (That which together with Iudaei Christianis, &amp; Chriſtiani Iudaeis, might alſo be placed vnder the Dayes Telling, having all one ſubiect with the Nights Certifying.)
            Of this ſort are, Aſterius (among the Greeke Scholiaſts,) Caſsiodore, Bonaventure, and others.
            It is true indeed that Chriſt ſpake vnto his Apoſtles the Glory of GOD. For t'was that which he ſought, &amp; not his owne glory. And I would, Beloved, that the ſame minde were in you all, which was in Chriſt Ieſus. I would wiſe men vnto wiſe men, Saints vnto Saints, the Elect vnto the Elect, Chriſtians vnto Chriſtians, yea Christians vnto Iews, Iews vnto Chriſtians, each one vnto another

did relate and recount, ſo as this Text beareth, the praiſe and honour of their GOD. I would not thē ſtand againſt th' Allegoricall ſenſe of theſe words, ſo much as now I doe: And that is no more, but by holding with them who haue ſtood for the Litteral. I dcny not, but that both the Golden Apple, and the Sylv
                     •
                  r Net wherein it is, that is, (as ſome haue beene conceited) Inter quos Rabbi Moſes ille Aegyptius vi de Pet. Galatin. de arcanis lib. 1. cap. 6.
               the myſticall and the litteral ſenſe, would doe well together to ſet forth The Dayes Report in his richeſt colours (to ſpeake improperly) of Or and Argent. For which purpoſe we alſo hereafter, if GOD will, ſhall chooſe out the pureſt of that Gold, to overlay the Dayes Report with Or, ornament of ornaments. vt Ezech. 16. 7. iuxta▪ Heb.chiefeſt ORnament. But becauſe the ſilver hath here leſſe alay in it, and is more warrantable, then the gold; I therefore covet rather, eſpecially at this time, to take part with them, who are enqueſted for the Sylver Senſe.
            Theſe are not all of one minde neither. And yet not of ſo diverſe, but that all their vnderſtandings may ſtand wel together, and may concurre, for the making vp of a fuller and more plentifull ſenſe: Or elſe each of them may well ſtande by it ſelfe, each one making a milder and more eaſie meaning by it ſelfe.
            
               Three, yea foure (or more) litteral Expoſitions are paſt already. Caietane expoundeth the whole verſe thus: In ſucceſſu dierum &amp; noctium generatur in nobis ex coeleſtibus notitia: tum quia vna dies aut vna nox non ſufficit: ſed quod videtur vna nocte de aſtris, principium eſt ad ſciendum in alia nocte: &amp; quod viſum eſt in vna aeſtate, principium est ad ſciendum in alia: &amp; quod viſum

est in vna aeſtate, principium eſt ad ſciendum in alia. Et quod viſum est in vna Eclipſi, principium eſt ad ſciendum in alia. Et ſic de ſimilibus coeli motibus, actionibus, &amp; effectibus. One Day is not ſufficiēt, but there muſt be more: One to tell another. By What is done ſuch a day or ſuch a night, or in ſuch a time of the year, in ſuch a yeare; We learn what may be done another the like Day, or Night, or in the ſame time of the yeare, another yeare. By what falleth out in one Eclips, wee gather what may befall in another Eclipſe. And ſo is there bred in vs knowledge of the motions, operations, and effects of the heavenly bodies, even by One Dayes telling another. One Day telleth another.
            
               So likewiſe Lyra vnderſtandeth theſe words, of the variations of the Daies cauſed by the motions of the heavens. Variatio dierum (ſaith he) ſecundum longitudinem &amp; brevitatem, caliditatem &amp; frigiditatem, &amp; alias variationes quae per motum coeli cauſantur, &amp; ſecundum certas periodos reiterantur, oſtendit potentiam &amp; ſapientiam motoris primi, ſcz. DEI. The variation of the Dayes according to their length and ſhortneſſe, lengthning and ſhortning, according to their heat and cold, and other ſuch like variations, &amp; diverſities, cauſed by the motions of the heavens, &amp; reiterated according to their certaine periods, Sheweth their Power, and Wiſdome of the Firſt Mover, that is, of GOD. And in like ſort Munster to haue vnderſtood the words of my Text, will appeare in the ſecond Generall part. One Day telleth another.
            The Litterall ſenſe that I
                     •
                  nſcnius bringeth of theſe words, beſides the affinitie it hath with ſome alreadie mentioned, inclineth much to that of Dionyſius Carthuſianus:
               
who entertaineth in theſe wordes, (that which well he may) a Metonymie: whereby The Day is ſaid to doe that, which is done in the day; to Tell that, which is told in the day. Hence Brentius here tranſlateth, Singulis diebus annunciat verbum. The knowledge of God encreaſeth dayly, And (according to that laſt expoſition, which the Ordinary gloſſe here bringeth Viz. Quòd haec doctrina diebus &amp; nectibus continuatur vſ

                  s.) is both by Day &amp; Night continued vnto all poſteritie; The workes of GOD, or men by the workes of God, doe from Day to Day, ſhew the Glory of his kingdome, and talke of his Power. So too One Day telleth another.
            
            
               Rabbi Schlomohs expoſition is, (like to ſome before going) that every Day and every Night with their cō
               tinuall courſe and order, doe ioyne together in the celebration of the Power and wiſedome of GOD. One Day Telleth another.
            
            
               Abraham Ezra taketh the meaning of the words to be (the ſame which before yee heard out of Bucer vpon the word 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) That every day bringeth forth ſome new worke or other of the Almighties: Becauſe every day, (and ſo every Night too) vttereth &amp; diſcloſeth ſome new matter, in which the power, wiſdome, and goodneſſe of GOD, is in a new maner, and after a peculiar ſort made manifeſt.
            
               Quidam ad eas laudes, quas à patribus acceperunt, addunt aliquam ſuam, ſaith Cicero 
               De Offic. lib. 1
               . So doth the Day, Beloued, even every Day, beſides that which it receiueth of the precedent dayes, as of his Aunceſtors or Predeceſſors▪ 
               Add ſtill ſome new matter of his owne, whereby GODS name is magnified. As if vix ea nostra voco,
               
were his motto. Who ſaith, that that which was done yeſterday, is done To Day? No more is that our doing, much leſſe our deſeruing, which others haue performed. Let every man proue his own worke (ſaith the Apoſtle Gal. 6. 4, 5.) and then ſhall he haue reioycing in himſelfe, and not in another. Even as every Day hath ſomething of his owne, ſomething done To Day, whereby hee gladly ſheweth forth GODS Glory, as all his Predeceſſors did. One Day tellerh another.
            
            Of like meaning are theſe words, in the iudgement of ſome (who iudge not amiſſe neither) with that of the heathen mens (but whoſe it is, is not yet well determined) Diſcipulus est prioris poſterior dies. The later Day is the former Dayes ſcholler, or Diſciple. Hence Bucer here tranſlateth, Dies diem docet, One Day Teacheth another.
            
            Omnis res anterior poſteriori norman praeminiſtravit, ſaith Tertulliā 
               Adverſin Marcionem. l. a.. Every fore-going thing preſcribeth, is as t'were a patterne, or a ſamplar, vnto that which followeth. Inquire of the former age, ſaith Iob. Iob. 8. 8. And, I haue conſidered the dayes of old (ſaith David) &amp; the yeares that are paſt. Pſal. 77. 5. Inquire now of the Dayes that are paſt, ſaith Moſes, (Deu. 4. 32.) which were before thee, ſince the Day that GOD created man vpō the earth, &amp;c. And Deut. 32. 7. Remember the dayes of old: (ſaith Moſes too) conſider the yeares of ſo many generations. For, One Day telleth another.
            To the full meaning and vnderſtanding of which words, it is as true, and all as pertinent too, that Prior dies poſterioris eſt diſcipulus; The former day is alſo the later

dayes ſcholler, or diſciple. One Day telleth another. The former day telleth the later, and the later the former. The firſt the Chalde Tranſlation ſeemeth to mee to haue aimed at by their word of Diminution. The ſecond alſo, by their word of Addition. And this later agreeably vnto that, which before yee heard out of Bucer. That the Later Day telleth the former Day, this the heathen men ſaw alſo, as well as they did the other. Hence is that of Aeſchylus 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . 955, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . Time as it groweth older and older, ſo it will informe thee better, it will teach thee more and more. And hence is that of Demea in Terence 
               Adelph. Act. 5 Scen. 4.
               : Nunquam ita quiſquam benè ſubductâratione ad vitam fuit; quin res, aetas, vſus ſemper aliquid apportet noui: aliquid moneat, vt illa quaete ſcire credas, neſcias: &amp; quae tibi putâris prima, in experiundo repudies. This, eſpecially if with the Apoſtle we preferre it to a higher ſenſe, may well ſerue to allay the puffe of knowledge in vs. 1. Cor. 8. 2. If any man thinketh that he knoweth any thing, hee knoweth nothing yet, as he ought to doe. For, One Day telleth another.
            
            Finally, if yee will haue the full and whole meaning of theſe words together, according to their fartheſt bout and circumference, reſpecting eſpecially The Matter of the Dayes Report: I muſt needes hold with The Rabbins. See Bucers preface to the Pſalmsthem, for this one place of holy Scripture, who avouched that every paſſage thereof was Seaventie manner of wayes to be interpreted. For I ſay not, that this place of holy Scripture may beare Interpretation ſeaventy manner of wayes; But, ſeauenty times ſeaventy. For Every Day, Every way conſidered, telleth every

Day every way conſidered, the Ever Ever-Ever laſting Glory of the Lord. So hath, One Day told another ever ſince the beginning; So doth, ſo ſhall, ſo may One Day tell another,

Every day, yea and every moment God ſheweth forth manifest tokens and teſtimonies of himſelfe, by conſideration whereof we are from Day to Day more and more furthered in the knowledge of God. Nec intelligas (ſaith Caietan) coelos narrare &amp; annunciare loquendo, ſed materiam narrationis &amp; annunciationis praebendo. We may not thinke that the heavens do declare, or that the dayes tell one another by ſpeaking, but by miniſtring matter for ſpeech and declaration. And (as Dionyſius Carthuſianus ſpeaketh) Dicuntur coeli enarrare Gloriam Dei, ſi

                materiam contemplande Creatoris potentiam, ſapientiam, &amp; perfectionem. The heavens (and ſo likewiſe the Day &amp;

the Night) are ſaid to declare the Glory of God, in that ſenſe that they are ſaid to bleſſe the Lord, and to praiſe his name: to wit, becauſe they furniſh their ſpectatours with matter and occaſion of contemplating the power, wiſdome, and perfection of their Creatour. According to that of Iſay (Iſa. 40. 26.) Lift vp your eies on high, and behold who hath created theſe things. Finally this One Dayes telling to another, is like vnto that in the 12 of Iob. v. 7, 8. Aske now the beaſts, and they ſhall teach thee: and the fowles of the heaven, and they ſhall tell thee: or ſpeake to the earth, &amp; it ſhall ſhew thee: or the fiſhes of the ſea, and they ſhall declare vnto thee. Thee, and, vnto Thee.
            
               So it is indeed; vnto Men, for Mans ſake, for his Learning, ad hominus vtilitatem, for Mans Profit, as Theodoret here ſpeaketh, that one day telleth another. Illi audiunt tanquam verbum eructuatum, (ſaith S. Auſtin) illi tanquam ſcientiam annunciatam. Quodenim ructuatur, praeſentibus ructuatur: They (that is, men) doe heare as it were a word, and as it were knowledge vttered vnto them▪ for looke what is vttered, is vttered vnto them in their owne perſons. One day inciteth vs by one thing, another by another, as anone yee ſhall heare out of Munſter. The noiſe that they make is like the voice of a cryer vnto Vs, like an Oyes wherby Our hearing is required. Their ſounding and reſounding, their

               is a catechiſing vnto vs. In the 145. Pſalme, whē the Prophet David had ſaid, All thy workes praiſe thee, O Lord &amp;c. They ſhew the mightineſſe of thy kingdome, &amp; talke of thy power; he addeth immediatly (the end thereof) That thy power, thy glory, and mightineſſe of thy kingdome,

might be knowne vnto men, v. 10, 11, 12. And how ever it be of that that is done; ſure we are, that what is written is written for our learning. Rom 15▪ 4.
            Let vs therefore obſerue for our inſtruction, that which was laſt ſpoken of the Dayes Speaking: The Maner of it; how that it is but by a Proſopopoeia. And it may well teach vs our dutie.

Or is it ſo rather, becauſe our tongue ſhould alwaies be ſounding forth the Glory of GOD? of GOD, who is our Glory, Ier. 2. 11. And, Let him that glorieth (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) glory in the Lord. 1. Cor. 1. 31.
            
            And yet ſee, whether the Day be not more forward in ſounding forth, &amp; ſpeaking the praiſes of our GOD, yea evē vnto vs our ſelues, rhen are we: which ſhould be the only ſpeakers in this lower houſe of the Parliament of GODS praiſes. For, heare what the Prophet David ſaith in the next verſe vnto my Text, according

vnto moſt Tranſlations: There is neither ſpeech nor language, but their voices are heard among them. And in the next to that: Their ſound is gone out into all lands and their words into the ends of the world. And as Iunius and Tremellius haue very well tranſlated the former verſe, Non est ſermo, ne

                   verba eis; &amp; ſine his intelligitur vox eorum. They haue neither ſpeech nor words, and yet is their voice very intelligible. According to that of S. Chryſoſtome (vpon that, The heavens declare the glory of God) 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . &amp;c. Tell me, how doe they declare the Glory of GOD? They haue no voice, they are not poſſeſt of any mouth, &amp; tongue they haue none at all. How then doe they declare the Glory of GOD? By their ſight, ſaith he. And afterwardes he declareth, how

                   Evang. l. 13. Sect. ſed Chriſtus.one) True Adoration is Aromaticall Delight: &amp; there is no ſmell to the ſpirituall ſmelling more delectable in this life, then of Vertues Flowers. But to recover me to the Dayes Diaphony againe; it is but Diſcors Concordia. They all agree in the ſhewing forth of his Glory, and giving vs good inſtructions. Such like diſcords hath Ovid. Met▪ lib. 10▪

               Concordare modos. Such like diſcords hath the Apoſtle S. Paul exhorted vs vnto, whē he would haue one to draw one way, another, another way, for the more glorious building vp of the Church of Chriſt. But how is that? ſome to hold of Paul, ſome of Apollos? or that there ſhould be ſtrife, envying, wrath, contentions, backbitings, whiſperings, ſwellings, &amp; diſcord, or tumultuouſnes (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               )? 2. Cor. 12. 20. No, no, Beloued; but every man to follow diligently his owne vocatiō, to doe his owne buſineſſe with ſingleneſſe of heart, and ſynceritie: according to the diverſities of gifts which we haue according to the grace that is giuen vs. As there at large, by the ſimilitude of diverſe members in one body, and diuerſities of offices of the members, the Apoſtle hath declared.
            A ſecond kind of diphonie required in vs, is: That wee ſhould not be vnequally yoked, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 2. Cor. 6 14. Haue no fellowſhip with the vnfruit full workes of darkneſse, but euen reproue them rather, Epheſ.

5. 11. The Day, Beloued, hath no commerce or cō
               ferēce with the Night, but with the Day. For, One Day telleth another. So if wee, that are children of the Day, (1. Theſſ. 5. 5.) haue any communion, or communication with, or about night-matters, a great chance but the Day ſhall declare it. 1. Cor. 3. 13. for, One Day telleth an other.
            
            
               A third kind of Diphony there is, that which S. Bernard Super Cantic. ſerm. 85.
               
               hath▪
                vt diſſentias tecum, vt tibimet adverſeris, vt gravi &amp; vigili lucta tu ipſe contra teipſum infatigabilitèr praelieris: poſtremo, vt valefacias inveteratae cō

                  que
                affectioni. For a man to diſſent from himſelfe, to oppoſe himſelfe against himſelfe, to striue and ſtruggle earnestly, and vigilantly with himſelfe, to bee infatigable in ſo encountering with himſelfe, Finally, to 
                  •
               aſſeere his inveterated evill cuſtomes, and his inbred affections.
            This contrarying and contradicting of one ſelfe, is in ſome ſort to be ſeene in that which One Day telleth another. For Contradictories, though not at the ſame time; yet the ſame Day, and in divers reſpects▪ they may be true. And many times the very ſame Day reporteth things that are cleane contrary. Witneſſe, ſorrow &amp; heavines, at the death of our late Queene: ioy and heavenlineſſe, at the raigne of our gratious Soveraigne; And all this in one Day: or elſe, heauineſſe continuing for a night, ioy came in the morning. One day ſo much differing from it ſelfe, to teach vs one day to become new men. One Day Telleth another.
            
            Secondly, the daies are 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , ſhrill and ſounding,
               
as already yee haue heard. But here we may heare the dutie both of Prieſt and People. The firſt I beſeech by the things which now they ſee, and quae ſunt oculis ſubiecta fidelibus: by the example of the Day, which now they cānot chooſe but eie, vnleſſe they ſhut their eyes of purpoſe, that they would bee ſtill more and more 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . Too raw, too young yet to ſpeake, &amp; to ſhew a mans ſelfe in ſuch an aſſēbly. If the Day ſhould ſo ſay of it ſelfe, wee had miſſed of his light in this Aſſembly. And if it ſhould ſtay vntill it came to ripeneſſe of yeares, yea or of dayes: it would never come vnto vs, we ſhould never ſee it. for, lo, to morrow it is gone. His voice doth not ſerue him to preach. So it ſeemes. And yet it is as good as the Dayes voice, if there bee any compariſon betwixt them. For the Day (as yee haue heard) hath indeed no voice at all: and yet in the preaching and predicating of GODS praiſes it hath a ſhriller voice then any trumpet, as hath beene told you out of S. Chryſoſtome▪ Behold I cannot ſpeake for I am 
               Ierem. 1.
               a child: would not ſerue the Prophet Ieremiahs turne. Nor here will it ſerue the Dayes turne, or excuſe it for not telling forth GODS Glory, becauſe it hath no voice to tell it withall. One Day Telleth another.
            
            The People alſo are here taught to preach GODS Glory, &amp; the congregation to talke of his praiſe. For who made the Day a Deacon, or a Prieſt? or elſe who ever gaue him Letters of Orders? yet is he ſtill a preaching vnto vs the Glory of GOD, that placed him in ſuch an order. Ought not we much rather to bee alwaies telling of his praiſe, who hath made vs of an higher Order

then the Day, and of an higher calling to call vpon him.
            And this is the rather ſpokē, becauſe of ſome, who, becauſe they are not in Orders, care not how diſorderly they liue▪ and becauſe they are not Prieſts, care not how prophanely: becauſe they are of the Laitie, care not how lewdly they cary themſelues in wordes and workes and converſation. Forgetting all the while Om

And that this is the beſt kind of ſpeaking and of preaching, and that which giveth all laudable act and perfection therevnto, either in Prieſt or People, S. Auſtin (De Doctrina Chriſtiana, lib. 4 cap. 28, &amp; 29) hath at large declared.

                  di forma viuendi. If it be ſo with a man, that he cannot be a preacher, for that he wants both wiſdome and eloquence of ſpeech; (for ſo S. Auſtin determineth of it) Then let him, yea he muſt bee a preacher in converſation and holineſſe of life. Let his holy and orderly living ſerue him inſteed of holy Orders, his formal cariage and demeanure ſerue him inſteed of a concionatory ſpeech moſt eloquently performed. And this kind of ſpeaking &amp; of preaching GODS Glory (wherevnto all, both Prieſt and People, are liable) commeth

neereſt of all to the Dayes telling one another in this place, which is by the due obſerving of the ordinance of the Dayes and Nights and Heavens Ordinary.

               as ſiſters dividing their fathers inheritance betwixt them, doe it with great good loue and liking on each part, they take their owne lot contentedly, neither of them intruding vpon the others right: So the Day and the Night haue the yeare parted evenly betwixt them, with as great aequality and aequabilitie. Which may wel teach vs to agree better then we doe. We goe to law, we wrangle, we brabble, wee cavill and fall out about ſmall matters: whilſt the Day with the Night, one day with another, never yet was at ſtrife and variance, never iarred about matters of as great moment as concerneth their whole eſtate, and as neceſſary as Light and Darkneſſe, Day and Night.
            
            
               One Day telleth another. Here too (in S. Chryſostomes vnderſtanding) is a leſſon for the covetous carle. 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . Heare yee this yee covetous, and greedy of other mens money: imitate the Day and Nights equalitie &amp; equabilitie, The Day pilleth not or polleth, it taketh nothing from his fellow, but giveth him rather, that which he hath to giue. For One Day telleth another.
            
            
               
It fareth with the Dayes in the yeere, as they ſay it doth with fruitfull trees and plants in ſome places of Barbary: where they plant vnder the Date tree, the Oliue tree: vnder the Oliue, the figge tree: vnder that the Pomegranate▪ vnder it, the Vine: vnder the Vine, they ſow Wheat: and vnder Wheat, pulſe: all proſpering one vnder the others ſhadow, &amp; yeelding their fruit the ſame yeere. So all the Dayes of the yeere are as it were planted one vnder the other, &amp; one aboue the other: ſome are higher, ſome lower; and placed are they Secundum ſub &amp; ſupra, making vp as it were a whole Predicament of GODS praiſes. The predicating whereof is the fruit they all beare, they all beare the ſame yeere, whileſt the one ſtill proſpereth &amp; cō
               meth vp vnder the Night and ſhadow of the other.
            This may ſhew vnto vs our duty &amp; condition. For we are all placed in this world, yea evē in this Realme, in like ſort as the Dayes: one vnder another, one in higher, another in lower place: alvnder one Summum Genus as it were, one moſt noble Soveraigne. He is vnto vs, as the Sunne to the Dayes that be vnder him: (for Gen. 1. 16. 18. and Pſal. 136. 8. The Greater Light was made to rule the Day) or, (to ſpeake too little of him) he is as the date tree to thoſe that be vnder him. He hath even the oliue tree vnder him, the figge tree, and the vine. Theſe three trees, Iudg. 9. wil teach vs that are Subiects our duties, evē as the daies of the yeare doe teach vs too. Theſe ſeek not Superiority one over the other; but look in what place GOD hath ſet them, be it better or worſe, higher or lower, formoſt or hindermoſt,

That they keepe, &amp; therein keepe the ordinances which GOD hath appointed them. 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , as ſaith S. Chryſostome vpon the words of my Text. They (the Dayes) keepe themſelues within their owne bounds and limits, and the one ſeeketh not to extrude the other. Nay &amp; he ſaith farther: 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . Heare yee this, yee highminded, and that are puffed vp, and who are loth to giue place, and yeld ſuperiority vnto others, (or who having once gotten into office, are loth to leaue the ſame againe for others) The Day giveth place vnto the Night, &amp; encrocheth not vpon that that ought not to bee his: But thou ſtill having and taking the fruition of honour &amp; preferment, canſt not abide thy brother to haue &amp; take part with thee. The dayes they intend to let their light ſhine, to ſhine vpon the earth. Gen. 17. to giue light vpon the earth. v. 15. 
               Mat 5. 16.I▪ would ye did intend nothing elſe, but to let your light ſo ſhine before mē, that they ſeeing your good works, might glorifie your Father which is in heaven. And I would yee did not rather ſtriue for Superioritie, for higher places, and one to goe before another.
            Hence are men now-adaies ſo prone to conſpiracy, treaſon, and rebellion▪ becauſe they are ſo vnlike the Dayes of the yeare, whilſt they cannot ſtay til it commeth to their turnes to be exalted. Yee may ſee▪ by the example of the Oliue▪
                the Fig-tree, and the Vine, (Iudg. 9.) That they that beare good fruit indeed, wil not

haue a kingdome, that appertaineth not to them, no though it be offered them▪ but rather giue themſelues to follow diligently that vocation, wherevnto they are called: ſo ſeeking to glorifie GOD, yea and to cheare him too, by the fruit of good living, like vnto the fatneſſe of the Oliue, the ſweet and good fruit of the Fig-tree, and the wine of the vine. But t'is the Bramble, or the Bryar, which beareth ſuch bad fruit, who would advance himſelfe aboue the trees, &amp; would haue all put their trust vnder his ſhadow. As if his ſhadow were a fit &amp; ſufficient ſhelter for the higheſt Cedars of Lebanon.
            
            Wherefore, Beloued, be yee not like vnto the ſcratching bramble, but to the good trees, that had rather liue vnder the ſhadow of another, and ſo bring forth fruite, not once a yeere only, but, like vnto the Tree of Life in the Reuelation, every Moneth of the yeare: yea Every Day of the yeare, while it is called To Day. Becauſe ſo doth every ſeverall Day of the yeare. One Day Telleth another.
            
            Here alſo, if we conſider the Dayes and the Nights too in Relation to their Rulers and Governours: we ſhal farther ſee how they Relate Gods Glory; whileſt they afford excellent inſtructions, both for the Rulers &amp; Guides of GODS people, and alſo for the People themſelues that are Guided and Governed.
            
            For the firſt: they ought to be like vnto the Rulers of the Day and of the Night. They are, The Lights in the 
               Gen. 3. &amp; vid. Ier. 31. 35.
               Firmament of the Heaven; The Sunne, The Moone, &amp; the Starres. Their Office two fold: To Rule, &amp; To Giue Light. So by them The Heavens Declare the Glory of God, &amp; the

Firmament ſheweth his Handy worke. So alſo by Kings &amp; Rulers, whileſt they are full of the Light of Knowledge, and not only Rule, but Giue Light too vpon the Earth; Their High Seas and Seates of Honour, their Thrones &amp; Chaires of Eſtate Declare the Glory of God, and their Commonwealths ſtrong Firmament ſheweth his Handy worke. Whileſt, I ſay, there is no Day or Night, no Subiect ſo Darke and Ignorant, but hath a 
               
                  Vid▪ Pſ. 2. 10.
               wiſe and Learned Ruler, and a Iudge, a Guide, a Leader well Iuſtructed. Such a one as in his place and calling, being himſelfe Lightſome, is very induſtrious in Giuing Light vnto his Day-and-Night Subiects and Inferiours.
            
            Such a one as is, firſt &amp; principally, Chriſt himſelfe: who is 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , The End and perfection of all Kingly Glory and Dominion: who ſhould be First in their Intention, that beare rule, yea and in their Attention too; as a perfect patterne and a moſt true Rule of well Ruling. Whoſe Dominion is from one end of the world vnto the other: Whoſe Throne is Everlaſting: Whoſe Scepter is a Scepter of Righteouſneſſe: Who is that Sunne of Righteouſnes, to whom in a Myſticall Senſe the 5. and 6. verſes of this Pſalme are moſt ſutable: and in Whom, as hereafter ſhall be ſhewed, the Glory of God is moſt reſplendent.
            But vnder him, and though in our Horizon Next &amp; Immediatly, yet a great way after him: Such a one as is our King, (not to flatter him, but that GOD may be more and more Glorified by Him, and he incited to Run on, in being Next and Annexed to him in Giuing Light, to whom in Ruling he is Next) who is like vnto

            Now likewiſe for the People: They may here learne and be admoniſhed, not to attempt, ſpeake, or imagin any Evill againſt their Rulers and Superiors: no more then doe the Dayes and the Nights; who to their Rulers oppoſe no vnrulines, neither withſtand they their

               Lights, leaſt they ſhould ſtand in their own Light, and ſo be nothing elſe but Darkneſſe. As it fareth with thē who by Diſobedience to their Guids and Governours, &amp; by plotting miſchiefe againſt thē, ſeeke to extinguiſh their owne Light: as though being wearie of ther Old Eyes, they would pluck them out, &amp; ſo either ſee with the holes, or exchāge them for New. And being herein ſo vnlike to Children of the Day, as that they are not to be reckoned Children of the Night: whilſt they enter meddle with ſuch hideous and prodigeous Workes of Darknes, as are not to bee found in the Blackeſt and the Darkeſt Night.
            
            Againe, the People are here taught, concerning their Kings and Princes, Rulers and Leaders, Guides and Governours: That though they be never ſo Good, never ſo well Allied, never ſo Wiſe &amp; Learned, yea though they were Gods Signet vpon his Right hand (Ier. 22. 24.) yet they ſhould not be Proud of thē, Glory in them, Preſume on them, or put

            All which not we only of this Land, but commonly All People of the world are, and haue beene, faultie in. Al which were more tolerable in the Dayes &amp; Nights, then in any of vs all. For as much as their Seducements ſhould be through greater Enticements 
               Vid Iob. 31 26▪ 27. Deut. 4▪ 19.. Their Rulers are in Higher place, more Glorious, more Full of Light, then ours: and if Solomon in all his royaltie were not like vnto one of the Lilies of the Field; much leſſe vnto all the lights of Heaven. Theirs are ſituated in a Firmament, ours in Infirmitie. Theirs haue a kinde of Everlaſting

               permanencie: ours, as ſoone as God taketh away their Breath they die, and are turned againe to their Earth, and to their Duſt. Their Rulers are of greater Might then ours. Witneſſe, their Motions, Influences, and Operations; their Oppoſitions, and Coniunctions, their ſeverall Aſpects, &amp; the like: whereby they are of ſo great force, both by Sea and Land, and in the Aire: being Cauſers alſo of Generation, and Corruption: ſhewing thereby the Glory of the Firſt Mover and Creator, and his Superexcellent Omnipotencie. And yet for all this, The Dayes and Nights are not Proud of them, Rely not on them, put no Affiance in them or their Alliance, deſert not their Allegiance, Dutie, and Obedience to their Creatour, &amp; to the Command of his Supremacie, becauſe of them: they Glory not in them, but in him that made them, &amp; made them (Day and Night, Light and Darkneſſe) before ſuch Rulers were ſet over them. They worſhip not the Creatures, but the Creator: finally they Report and Declare his glory, and not theirs: but ſo as theirs alſo redoundeth to his glory, who is Bleſſed for ever.

            We are ſo farre off from beſtowing our Breath vpon the Continual pronunciation of Gods Glory, and vpon the preſerving of vnity of words, That we rather beſtow it in pronouncing the contrary, and in Diſvniting of Things and perſons. Our Tongues, our Wits, our Spirits, &amp; our Liues, which we ought rather to ſpend in Keeping the vnity of the Spirit in the bond of peace (Eph. 4▪ 3.) are waſted to the diſhonour of GOD, in making worſe then Superſtitious Diuiſions, and ſeparations of Things that God hath ioined togither: yea and of Religion it ſelfe, vnder a pretence only of Religion, and of Gods Glory. This, and the like Expence, or Miſpending rather, though it be of Life and Breath it ſelfe, vpon Gods Glory, and Mans Good, is but Equivocall, and Counterfeit: T'is Antichriſtian Scattering (Luk. 11. 23.)

Et vid. Iob. 12. 10. Zech. 12. 1. Gen. 2. 7 &amp;, Pſal. 146. 1, 3. &amp;, 150. v. 6.) and in the Releeuing of our poore diſtreſſed Brethren, a high point of Gods Honour too.
            A high point is this of Gods Honour, To haue Reſpect vnto Low Things: A thing reſembling Gods Goodneſſe, a Pleaſing Sacrifice vnto him, and to the Dayly Offering whereof All Dayes &amp; Nights, together with their Rulers, doe invite vs. The one, like vnto the King of Heavens Amongrs, Diſperſe abroad, and giue Euery Day &amp; Night the Light of his Beneficēce.

That Bread that comprehendeth all the reſt, that we can and can not comprehend. Which our Heavenly Father giving vs, and having giuen for vs all; how ſhall he not with him alſo freely giue vs All things?
            
            Then God giuing vs ſuch Bread, and that Continually: and we Dayly praying vnto God to giue it to the poore as well as to our ſelues: ſhall we, vnthankfully croſſing the fulfilling of our owne deſires, be ſparefull and Niggardiſh of our Bread, in communicating it vnto our Brethren? Our Brethren? yea, or (if that be not enough) in lending it backe againe vnto our Father? Who if he giue vs All things ſpirituall and Temporall, is he not worthy of the lone of Some Temporall? He that giveth to vs all Bread, and light, and life to eate it in, and hath

promiſed to giue vs Bread, and light, and life Eternall?
            
            And now it may bee we will brag of giuing Bread vnto the poore, and that perhaps Every Day. But then, Beloved, let vs remember the Addition that is annexed to Our Bread that God doth giue vs, as it were preſcribing a Conditiō of liberality to our giuing. Without which, it is not our Bread, that is, ſuch as is in our Dayly prayer, which wee giue. It is our Cour

                  sts, of making proviſion for the Fleſh to fulfill the Luſts thereof, of any longer wooing of the world, Flattering of the Fleſh, Making Suit to Hell, and Courting of the Diuel. Such Wooing will proue to bee our Woeing, not by taking away of any O, but by adding a thouſand Woes vn to vs all. Such Sowing to the Fleſh and Sow-wallowing in the Mire, will proue to be our Reaping of Corruption, &amp; vnrecoverable pollution. Such Suit, wil proue The Deeps Swallowing of vs vp; Such Courting, our Carting vnto Hell. In a word, Such Glory will be to our ſhame: Such Minding Earthly Things, will bring Damnation in the End; &amp; the rather, becauſe wee ſo little regard Every Dayes Continuall Suite vnto vs, and Telling one another, if not to the contrary, yet that it ſhould be to the Cō

                  PSALM. 19. VERSH 2.
                  One Day Telleth another, or, One Day telleth a word vnto another, &amp;c.
               
            
            
               Part. 3▪
                
               AT the firſt handling of theſe words (Right Worſhipfull and all alike welbeloved in Chriſt Ieſus) I propoſed to your godly conſiderations 3. generall parts. The firſt was, the Meaning of the words: The ſecond, the Mā
                  ner of the Dayes ſpeech: The third, the Matter, or, the Subiect of their ſpeech. About the two firſt were ſpent the two firſt Sermons. Now remaineth, that, by GODS gracious aſſiſtance and your great good patience, the reſt be taken vp by the Matter, or the Subiect of their ſpeech.
            The Subiect then, if we take it more properly, is that which we falſely call the Subiect of Logick, even Res Omnes, All Things. Which Logitians, like Sophiſters, mainetaine to bee the End of Logique. For then Res

Omnes, All Things, beareth with them no other meaning then Res Aliquae, Some Things. For ſo they expound their Res Omnes, to be Rerum omnium conceptus qui primi conceptus, ſiue primae notiones appellari ſolent. And hee ſhould be a mad fellow, that ſhould take the conceipts or names of things to be All things, and ſo impiouſly collect, that more liuing things haue beene of mans making then of GODS: becauſe in the ſecond of Geneſis man gaue the other living things their names, although GOD gaue them their formes, whence they had both to be, and to be named. And ſo it will proue in the end, that Res Omnes, All things, are not Logicks Subiect, no not any Thing at all is the Subiect thereof: vnleſſe Logicke will bee content to take things in conceipt, or Names inſteed of things: as wont it is to be fed with Demonſtrations, when as ſome other carieth away the Effects.
            They muſt then leaue Res Omnes, All things, to be the Subiect of One Dayes ſpeech vnto another, the Subiect of his Glory, who made All things out of Nothing, and by working on ſo barren a Subiect, gaue each Day as plentiful a Subiect to declare on, as all Things are.
            And yet if we take the Subiect more improperly, for the End; t'is but one thing, that is here the Subiect: even The Glory of GOD, that endleſſe Ende wherefore all things are, and doe continue. This therefore is no Adequate Subiect; with which neither All things, nor All Reports can match in Exequation, much leſſe can make any true Exaggeratiō
                thereof, but only by a true

               Antiphraſis. This Subiect alſo (if we goe no farther thē 
               The Booke of the World, or, The Dayes Grammar,) is the Only Part, or Parts of Speech, that the Day hath. As it were to teach vs, That all the parts of our Speech ſhould bee ſo declined and vndeclined, in reſpect of Good and Evill, That they ſhould at no time ſwerue, or Decline from Gods Glory. This the Grammar of the Scripture Telleth vs too; That whatſoever we doe wee ſhould doe all to the Glory of GOD: And, That Our Speech ſhould be ſo ſeaſoned, as that it may Miniſter Grace vnto the Hearers.
            And here firſt I admoniſh all, who vndertake any Matter or Subiect to ſpeake, or to write of, eſpecially the Poets and Criticks of theſe dayes, to learne here of the Dayes, what Matter to treat &amp; to write of. Eſpecially, wheras they are not ignorāt, that God hath created every man for his Glory, Iſa. 43. 7. And therefore not to imploy his wit, or weare out his time otherwiſe. What a ſhame then is it for Chriſtiā Poets to chooſe vnto themſelues no better Subiects then they doe, the moſt of them? in ſo much that t'is a ſhame even to name thoſe things whereof they write. A great ſcandall, Beloued, to Chriſtianitie, and a fowle eie-ſore to thoſe that are without. Happily (to make the beſt of it)

But as for GOD and their Creatour, hee is as farre off from their Matter, as they are farre off from him: who notwithſtanding, as Theognis ſaith, is to bee propoſed to vs in our poetrie,

And here I cannot but commend vnto you, and to your imitation Saluste Du Bartus, a Poet aboue the ordinary levell of the world, for the choice of his ſubiect moſt rare and excellent, and ſuch as is the Dayes Subiect here in my Text. Or elſe ſhall I rather commend vnto you our Prophet David here, who throughout this whole Booke of Pſalmes maketh the praiſe and glory of GOD to be ſtil the ſugar-burden of his ſong: the inſcription of the whole booke being, The

This Glory of GOD to bee the Subiect of One Dayes Speech vnto another, This Praiſe of his to be the price they all intend and contend for in all their conference, was every where pointed at in my former Sermons.
            
               One Day telleth another. That which One Generation is ſaid to tell another, yea and which all the workes of GOD are ſaid to ſhew and to talke of in the 145. Pſal. Where, v. 4. One Generation ſhall praiſe thy workes vnto another, and declare thy power. And v. 10, 11, 12. All thy workes prayſe Thee, O Lord &amp;c. They ſhew the Glory of thy Kingdome, and talke of thy power. And looke what the Heavens are here ſaid to declare in the firſt verſe of this Pſalme, The Heavens declare the Glory of God: and Pſal. 97. 6. The Heavens haue declared his Righteouſnes: &amp; what the Firmament is here ſaid to ſhew, (v. 1.) The Firmament ſheweth his Handy Worke: Of that alſo is it here to be vnderſtood, that One Day Telleth another.
            
            So that, what for the infiniteneſſe of GODS Glory (for, who can expreſse the noble acts of the Lord, or ſhew forth all his praiſe? Pſ. 106. 2. And The Lord is great and cā not worthily be prayſed. Pſ. 96. 4. And, The glorious Name of God excelleth aboue all thankſgiuing and praiſe. Nehe. 9. 5.) And what for the manifold Workes of God (O Lord how manifold are thy Works? Pſ. 104. 24. evē as manifold as All Things are;) I find my ſelfe in a narrow ſtreight,

themſelues ſo thicke together, and flying ſo faſt one after another; that, what with their faſt flying, ſome one way, ſome another, every way a great cry, my memory and ſight were ſo diſtracted, that my whole deſigne was broken of.

                in reſpect of vs) but Himſelfe being the cauſe and fountaine of all Glory and Goodneſſe.
            
            This maketh the difference betwixt Gods Glory &amp; others to be as great, as is betwixt an everlaſting foū
               taine and one drop iſſuing thereout: yea and as is betwixt the nature of God himſelfe, and the natures of other things.

And it being in it ſelfe ſo true which Zophar ſpeaketh, Iob. 11. 7. Canst thou by ſearching finde out God? Canſt thou finde out th' Almighty: to his perfectiō? And that too of Elihu, Iob. 37. 23. The Almighty: we cannot finde him out.) We may not think that the Glory of GOD is Totally, or Integrally declared by the Heavens and the Firmament, or that One Day telleth All This Glory vnto another. For that were rather to deifie the Dayes, the Heavens, &amp; the Firmament, Then the Deity to be by them declared to be glorious.
            
            Therefore as Moſes was permitted to ſee but parts, and that the backe parts too, of Gods Glory: ſo there is no creature, no not all the creatures in the world, that can declare more then part or parts of Gods Glory.
            This here the Prophet David intimateth vnto vs. Who, when he had ſaid, (verſ. 1.) The Heauens declare the Glory of God, for as much as he meant not the whole complete Glory of God, and for farther explication, hee afterwards inſiſteth on ſome particulars therof, ſaying: The Firmament ſheweth his Handy worke. One Day telleth a word vnto another; And, One Night Knowledge vnto another, &amp;c.
            So the holy Spirit of God abundantly in the Scriptures ſpeaking of Gods Glory, for our better apprehē
               ſion thereof, and to apply himſelfe to our capacities,

vſeth to deſcend frō the Glory of God in Generall, or the naming thereof, to the ſetting forth &amp; deſcribing of it by ſome Particulars; ſuch as are accoūted among men (through the ſhallow reach of our vnderſtanding and iudgement) equivalent Synonymaes with Glory.
            
            
               So the Glory of God is in the Scriptures explicated and varied by the names of Maieſty, Kingdome, Excellencie, a Glorious Name, Righteouſneſse, Mercy, Truth, Greatneſſe, Power, Praiſe, Beauty, Light, &amp; ſuch like. Yea and ſometimes too, by Gay Apparell, and Excellent Attire. For in ſuch things alſo are mē wont to place Glory. Hence ſaith the Scripture, 
               Pſal. 104 2.He hath put on Glorious Apparell. And, 
               V. 1.He is become exceeding Glorious, hee is cloathed with Maieſty and Glory. And 
               Iob. 40. 5.He decked himſelfe with Maieſty and Excellencie, and arayeth himſelfe with Beauty and Glory. And, 
               Pſal. 66. 2.Sing forth the Glory of his Name: make his Praiſe Glorious. And, 
               Pſal. 145 5.I will meditate of the Beauty of thy Glorious Maieſty. And, 
               1. Cor. 16. 27Praiſe and Glory are before him: Power and Beauty are in his place. And, as before yee heard, They ſhew the Glory of thy Pſal. 145. 11.Kingdome, and talke of thy Power. And, as before alſo was alleaged, 
               Pſal. 97, 6The heavens haue declared his Righteouſneſse. And, 
               Deut 5. 24.Behold the Lord our God hath ſhewed vs his Glory &amp; his Greatneſſe. And, 
               Pſal. 57, 11.The Greatneſſe of thy Mercy reacheth vnto the heavens, and thy Truth vnto the Clowds.
            So is it ſtill but by ſome excellent Particulars of Gods Glory, that he giveth vs ſome taſte of that whole, whoſe Halfe is more then the whole worldes Glory:

yea, whoſe leaſt title is more, then all the higheſt Titles in the world can ſtile ſufficiently. Were it poſſible for vs at once to comprehend, what ever thereof ever any Day or Night hath vttered: yet ſtill might we ſay vnto GOD, like to that that the Queene of Saba ſaid vnto Solomon. 1. King. 10. The one halfe was not told vs. For thou hast more Glory, more Wiſdome, and Proſperitie, then we haue heard by Report. Yea, and yet ſo as hath beene ſaid, to wit partly &amp; particularly, is the Glory of GOD as many waies ſignified vnto Man, as any thing or creature is by the bountifulneſſe of GOD any waies dignified.

Hence hee hath made euery thing beautifull in his time, Eccleſiast. 3. 11. yea and according to the Riches of his Glory, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh Epheſ. 3. 16.,There is not any thing, but hath ſome Glory or other: even Hooker, l. 5. ſect▪ 42.

               That, wherein his higheſt perfectiō doth conſist. So 1. Cor. 15. There is a Glory of the

Sunne, a Glory of the Moone, and a Glory of the Starres; So there is a Glory not only of the heavenly, but even of the earthly Bodies. According to the ſeverall and different degrees of the divine ſimilitude and perfection, which GOD vouchſafeth to cōmunicate to all his creatures.
            For although the Glory of GOD be in it ſelfe ſuch as hath been ſaid, or rather ſuch as cannot be ſaid what it is: yet ſo exceeding boūtifullly hath God dealt with vs, as that

So whilſt wee cannot looke directly into the bright body of the Sun, for the dazeling luſtre thereof: yet illustratos claritate illius montes videamus, as S. Gregory

               Bernard hath the like: We may with eaſe ſee how the Sunne ſhineth vpon the hils. whilſt we cannot ſee GODS glory and liue, ſuch is the inſuperable and inſufferable force thereof yet may we behold things inferiour vnto him (&amp; ſo are all things) be beamed with the brightneſſe of his glory.
            
               
Not but that hee could haue made Them too, too hard for vs to looke vpon: (a taſt whereof wee haue in the ſhining face of Moſes, as alſo in the ſurface of the brighteſt bodies) But in his goodneſſe hee would not; That ſo hee might the more communicate his goodneſſe vnto man, by imparting ſo much the more, and more ready knowledge of the innumerable parts of that glory, which ſurpaſſeth knowledge.
            Hence hath our good GOD provided vs of that Booke I told you of in the beginning, then tearmed The Booke of the World: but now is it become The Booke of GODS glory too. A Booke of golden Hoſ. 12 10. It is reckoned amongſt the benefits, and louing kindneſſes of God towardes his people, that in ſpeaking vnto thē

               Similitudes of GODS glory, yea and a Book gloriouſly garniſhed with the Images therof. According as every thing approacheth more or leſſe to the higheſt perfection; Some bearing the very Image thereof: but every thing ſome way or other reſembling it, and bearing likeneſſe, if not liking therevnto.

            And here we may obſerue, that which Moller hath well noted on my Text and the verſe aforegoing (Athanaſius alſo ſaying, In Fragmēt. Images Beproued.that David in this Pſalme 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

               Firmament, the Day and the Night, yea and the whole ſtate of things created; that by the enſignements of them, and by ſuch goodly monuments, we ſhould bee admoniſhed of the Creatours moſt excellent glory, and moſt glorious Excellencie.
            Where neither is there a Nomāclator wāting vnto vs. The names, the natures, the offices of all things; their hid properties, their proper vertues, their vertuous endowments are all diſcovered vnto vs, by the continuall Report that One Day vnto another, and every Day vnto vs, maketh of them. Every Day and Night, like ſo many Bedils, ſtill attēding vs for the ſame purpoſe, and to tell vs: Such, and ſuch are the badges, Such and ſuch the traces of his glory: There's his Aeternitie, There's his Power, There's his wiſdome, There's his Goodnes, There's his Truth, There's his Iuſtice, There's his Prouidence, There's his Mercy to be ſeene. And ſo alike of all the Glorious attributes of GOD; according as Calvin

            So that what ever of theſe it be that they ſhall pretend to be put in minde of by their Images: they are more, and better put in minde of thē by all the works &amp; creatures of God. Yea

               to be knowne concerning God, is manifest in them. For the inviſible things of him are ſeene by the Creation of the World, they being conſidered, or, vnderſtood by his

Workes. By his workes. And ſo by Similitudes &amp; Images of Gods owne making, Gods own warranting, Gods owne appointing for that purpoſe: for which they would haue pictures and Images of mans making to ſerue, yea and of mans maintaining too, againſt the expreſſe prohibition of God himſelfe.
            Vnleſſe they will fly to that miſerable ſhift &amp; baſe tricke of begging the queſtion in Logique, to haue the felling downe of the Second Commandement handſmooth to be granted them: A thing as much as any thing elſe to be ſtood on by vs, till ſuch time as they ſhall haue proved their Church to be of that nature of freehold. For otherwiſe, they fall vpon the dint of that Commandement ſo much the more by their Images, becauſe they ſay they haue them to put them in minde of God. For the having of other things enough beſides, to doe that; is a reaſon, why we ſhould not make Images for that purpoſe. For to tranſgreſſe Gods Commandement lightly and needleſly, is not a lighter ſinne, then to doe it vpon ſome kinde of Neceſſitie.
            And that we haue other things enough beſides to put vs in minde of God, this 19. Pſalme is ſufficient to proue vnto vs. In the laſt verſe whereof, wee haue The Redemption of the world, chiefly to remember vs of God, &amp; of his Glory. In the verſes going before that, vnto the ſixt verſe, we haue the Statutes and Commandements of God, doing the ſame alſo: in that they Verſ. 7.

               Verſ. 8.
               giue light vnto the eies; and by them is Gods

ſervant taught. And that Commandement it ſelfe, which forbiddeth Images, as alſo foure other of the firſt, together with the Preface, make ſuch often mention of God, and of the Lord, as if God had thereby purpoſely anticipated that Reaſon of the Papiſts, heretofore of the heathen; by telling them, that that ſo often mentioning of his name, and thoſe his Commandements ſo pure, ſo ſure, and ſo ſweet (as here the Prophet David calleth them) muſt needes put them ſtill in minde of God, if they regarded thoſe his Cōmandements, but ſo much as to remember them.
            Thirdly, we haue all The workes of God whatſoever, Qui
                     •
                  quidagit: Which Genebrard too vnderſtandeth by the Iudgements of the Lord, in the 9. verſe: but muſt needes be included within that, which is in this ſecond verſe, One Day telleth another.
            
            Fourthly and laſtly, we haue all thoſe Reſemblances of the Creatour, wherewith God, that is 1. Cor. 15. 28
               all in all, deigneth to dignifie all and every of his Creatures.
            
            Which is reaſon ſufficient, why wee ſhould not make any graven Image, or the likeneſſe of any thing to put vs in minde of God: eſpecially thoſe being vnto vs ſuch bad Remembrancers of God, when they ſo ill reſemble him: (The Godhead being not like vnto gold, or ſilver, or ſtone graven by art and the invention of man, as S. Paul ſaid, in the ſeaventeenth of the Verſ. 29.Acts.) And whereas otherwiſe we haue even all the Workes &amp; Creatures of God, better Remembrācers of God; in as much as they are all better reſemblers of his Glory. There being not one of them all, but (as before was begun to

be declared) ſome way or other doth reſemble him.

               ſaith, Nulla quidem res eſt, quae non aliquam cum Deo ſimilitudinem habeat: quia omnis effectus ſimilitudinem aliquam habeat cum ſua cauſa neceſſe eſt. Ita fit vt nihil ſit in mundo, in quo non aliquod Dei, divinae

                bonitatis veſtigium impreſſum conſpiciatur. There is no one thing, but is ſomewhat like vnto God: for that every Effect muſt needs be ſomewhat like his Cauſe. Hence it is, that there is nothing in the world, in which appeareth not ſome print of Gods beautifull footing, and ſome impreſſion of his goodneſſe. And 
               Hier. Savonarol. de triumph. Crucis. l. 1. c. 10.

By the former whereof, they attribute the perfection of every thing vnto God: Againe by the latter, which is the Negatiue, they in ſome ſort thwart and croſſe the Affirmatiue, ſhewing ſome obliquity therein; But ſo as Anaximander Mileſius, ſhewing the obliquity of the Zodiack, is therefore ſaid

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) he giueth a reaſō why the Word, or, Sonne of God is called Day, ſaying:

               . Hee is the Word that giueth light vnto things hidden and in obſcuritie, &amp; by whome every creature was brought vnto light and being. and ſo is he called Day. And t'is a good rule of Dionyſius, (de Divin. Nom. cap. 10.) yeelding alſo another reaſon hereof: 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

               , and as being the Cauſe and Author of Dayes, of Time, and of Aeternitie. For which cauſe, (ſaith Dionyſius

               immediatly before) as alſo for that he is indeed the Time and Eternitie of all things (in regard of the puritie of their perfection) and becauſe of his being before all Dayes, all Time, and all Eternitie: God is in the ſeavēth of Daniel called the Ancient of Dayes. The Ancient of Dayes] a

               Figura haec ſieri debet out ornandae rei cauſa quae pulchra eſt, out vitande, quae turpis eſt.
               therefore the Dayes made choice of to Adorne and ſet forth the Eternitie of God.
            And herein appeareth greatly the Glory of GOD; The Day it ſelfe being ſo full of Beautie and Perfection. Which as heretofore 
                  Serm. 2.it hath beene ſhewed, ſo hath it alwaies been acknowledged by man. This was not very obſcurely intimated by Iob, who (Iob. 42. 14.) called the firſt of thoſe three faire daughters of his, Iemimah, that is, Day 
               Ita vule▪ Edit. ita Lebcus in Onomaſtico, in verbo Diem.: it may be too,
            —quarum quae longè pulcherrima. Neither was it vnacknowledged by the Heathen; that which was collected by them, as otherwiſe, ſo alſo by that goodly order, heretofore
                  Serm. 2. 
               
                  Serm. 2.ſpecified, of the Day and Night continually ſucceeding one the other. Hence, for their Beautie and Comelineſſe, haue they alſo likened thē rather vnto women then to men. As appeareth by the propounding &amp; expounding too of that Riddle in the life of Aeſop, where t'is ſaid: 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . The Day and Night two women, enterchangeably ſucceeding one another.
            
            And yet for all this, That the Day is ſo Faire &amp; Beautifull in the eies of the whole world: hee that made the whole world muſt needs be fairer. And that ſo infinitly beyond compariſon: as that the Day it ſelfe is no

               Day, but Night, in this reſpect: yea and that GOD himſelfe is no Day, but infinitely aboue all Dayes perfections, and therefore a more excellent kinde of Day. As alſo what ever elſe it bee, that the Day or any other of GODS creatures declareth to be in God, it declareth it to be in him after a more excellent maner.

Auſtin in his firſt booke againſt the Manichees, the ſecond Chapt. And hee ſeemeth to haue taken it out of Dionyſius in the place cited; where 
               Where hee ſaith: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . (where, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                  , &amp;c.
               the ſame in Greeke is to be found. the Engliſh of both is this: This world is not of the ſame Eternity with God. For God made the World, &amp; Time took his beginning with that which God created in the beginning. And therefore though time may in ſome ſort be ſaide to be Eternal: yet is it not ſo Eternall, as is God: for that God is before all Time, in as much as he is the maker thereof. And vpon the 9. Pſalme ſaith S. Auſtin, Quid est ſeculum ſeculi, niſi cuius effigiem tanquam vmbram habet hoc ſeculum? Viciſſitudine enim temporum ſibi ſuccedentium, &amp;c: aeternitatis quaedam imitatio est. What is [world without end] ſaith he, but that which this world hath ſome ſhadow,

or reſemblance of? For in the continuall viciſſitude of times ſucceeding one the other, there is a certaine Imitation of Eternity. And that it is another manner of Eternity which is in God, then that which is in the Dayes, the World, or Times of the World; and that this Eternity is but a counterfeit, and indeed none at all, in reſpect of that: is manifeſt by Eternall Duration: in which (as t'is in the Additions on the 89. Pſalme) Omnes Dies ſunt 
                  And, as Seneca hath of 
                  
                     〈◊〉

All Dayes are at once, &amp; doe not one ſucceed the other; as they they doe with vs here in this world. And therefore no marveile, if with God One Day (as S. Peter 2. Pet. 3. 8. &amp;, vid. Eccl. 18 10.
               ſaith) be as a thouſand yeeres, and a thouſand yeeres as one Day; with whom all Dayes and times are all together and all alike preſent. And therefore he only truely hath Eternity.
            
            And as it is of the Eternity of the Dayes; ſo is it of all other the Dayes Reſemblances of their makers Glory. Among the reſt, the Light of the Day, is no light argument, how that God is infinitly a purer kinde of Light, and as farre ſurpaſſeth the Day-Lights abſoluteſt perfection: perfection? yea rather imperfectiō, if wee compare it with the ſuperperfectneſſe of the Creatour.
            This, &amp; this vſe of ſetting forth Gods Glory, by truely extenuating the Day and Lights perfection in their higheſt elevation, is pointed out vnto vs in the 7. of Sap 7. 29. 30
               Wiſdome: where t'is ſaid of the Wiſdome of God: Shee is more beautifull then the ſunne, and is aboue all the order of the ſtarres, and the Light (or, the Day, as God called the

Light 
               Gen. 1. 5.
               Day:) is not to be compared vnto her. For Night commeth vpon it, but Wickedneſse cannot overcome Wiſedome. The Day-Light, for all his rare perfection, yet muſt needs endure his darke oppoſite, the Night, his obſcureſt adverſary, to come over it, yea and for the time to overcome it; But the Light of Gods Wiſedome hath no enemy (no not the

            Quid tibi videbitur Divina Lux, cùm illam ſuo loco videris? Seneca, vbi ſuprà.Thou that ſo much admirest the Light of this World, what then, thinkeſt thou, Wilt thou thinke of that Light of God in Heaven, when thou ſhalt ſee it There in his Brightest Glory: or, ſhalt there See God As He Is, as S.

            Now here to declare the Glory of God, but ſo as vnto the World it is declared; we had need ſummon together All Things with their Perfections. But becauſe the ſummons would ſo be longer in ſending forth, thē I may be in ſpeaking vnto you at this time: we will

now content our ſelues with thoſe and their perfections, who are preſent already; and therefore need not to be warned to make their appearance, but that their appearance be in their owne likeneſſe; ſuch as their Creatour hath allowed and allotted them, in making them after His owne likenes: And they are, The Dayes here in my Text, with their Perfections; And you, Men, Fathers, &amp; Brethren, who are all the children of the 
               1. Theſſ 5. 5.
               Day, with all your Excellencies.
            
            
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , ſaith Aristotle, in his 7th booke of Phyſicks, and the 4. Chapter; The proper vertue of a thing is his perfection. And the Vertue of each thing is, to doe that paſſingly well, for which by the maker thereof it was ordeined and appointed. So the Vertue of all the Workes of God is to ſerue excellently well to that purpoſe, to which God hath deſeigned them. That they may do (as Elihu 
               Iob 37. 12.ſpeaketh) Whatſoever he commandeth them vpon the whole World.
            
            
               This is otherwiſe tearmed their Beauty, their Rationall, or Intellectuall Faireneſſe. So ſaith Simon de 
                  Lib. 4. cap. 1.Caſsia very excellently: Quam pulchritudinem quaelibet creatura ſingulatim at
                  
                     
                  
                  que
                coniunctim habere poteſt in ordine vniverſi, quàm vt id agat quod ſibi praeceptum at
                  
                     
                  
                  que
                impoſitum eſt, &amp; illum obtineat finem ad quem ordinata eſt? &amp;c: What other Beauty or Comlineſse, in a ſo wel ordered World, ether iointly or ſeverally can Gods creatures haue, Then to doe that which is inioyned &amp; commaunded them, &amp; to attaine and retaine ſtill that end, wherevnto they were ordeined?
            So is every Tree at his faireſt, whē it bringeth forth

ſuch fruit, as the firſt and Naturating Nature hath naturally ingraffed in it, according to his kinde. So there is no greater faireneſſe of the Eie, then ſight▪ of the Eare, then hearing: of the Noſe, then ſmelling: Theſe being the Ends wherevnto nature hath advanced thē. So the Dayes are then at their faireſt, when they ſerue mans turne to worke &amp; labour in. For herevnto hath God ordeined them: according to that, Pſal. 104 23,
               Man goeth forth to his worke, and to his labour vntill the evening: And, Ioh. 11. 9.
               Are there not twelue houres of the Day? And, Mat. 6. 34.
               Sufficient for the Day is the travaile therof. Inſtigat

            This, and all this, maketh the Nature of the Day to be ſo hard a thing for vs to define: A thing attempted indeede by many; yet never (for ought I know) attained vnto by any. And no marveile. For if the true differences of all things be of ſo hard enquirie, as that

that difference, whereof wee thinke our ſelues moſt ſure, hath ſuffered ſome doubt: (good Eaurentius Valla, Franciſcus Valleſius, &amp;c.Philoſophers maintaining other creatures beſides man to be reaſonable, and S. Baſil defending againſt

            And this againe argueth, how much more his own nature and perfection is beyond our reach, who hath made the Day and the Light ſuch, as ſurmounteth the height of humane wit and vnderſtanding.

which are made knowne vnto man, &amp; that by meanes of the Dayes revealing and relating the ſame one vnto another.

               Did ever people heare the voice of God ſpeaking out of the midſt of a fire, as we haue heard, and lived? And that in the 36. verſe, Out of heaven he made vs heare his voice to inſtruct vs, &amp; vpon earth he ſhewed vs his great fire, and we heard his voice out of the midſt of the fire. The fire? yea, Beloved, &amp; ſuch a fire, (that ſhould haue beene) as never the Iſraelites heard of. Their Dayes can tell ours of ſuch a fire as was never heard of before: and ours againe can requite theirs with the Report of ſuch a fire of gunnepowder, as heretofore hath not beene heard of.

Forget not the Day, the 5. Day of November, wherein thou wert ſo ſtrangely delivered, and learne therby to feare me all the Dayes that thou ſhalt liue vpon the earth. Teach thy children, ſaying, as t'is in Pſal. 118. 24.the Pſalme, This is the Day which the Lord hath made; or (as others read) This is the Day, in the which Lord hath made: hath made a mighty deliverance for vs his people of this Land: and hath made his Glory knowne to the whole world, by ſo, ſo preſerving vs that Day.

            And all this is to learne vs a good leſſon, by the example of the Dayes, and other of Gods creatures, to doe but as they doe in ſetting forth GODS Glory: That is, to hold vs to our Owne Glory, and by that which is our Beautie and Perfection; to endeauour to demonſtrate vnto all the world, what a Beautifull &amp; Perfect Creatour We all haue. Our beſt way of Glorifying GOD, being even by that wherein our chiefeſt Perfection doth conſiſt.

               vnto him as is poſsible, &amp; to be made Perfect by him. Againe; there being a twofold worſhip of God, Externall and Internal: and the Outward being ordained for the Inward, as an handmaide to attēd it, ſo the Internall being the chiefeſt: It muſt needs be, that our Chiefeſt perfectiō 
               muſt be included within the Inward worſhip of GOD. Interiorem autem verum Dei cultum, dicimus eſſe rectitudinem ac perfectionem vitae hominis interioris. And the true inward worſhip of God, wee call Vprightneſſe and Perfection of life in the inward man. So The holier a mans life is, the Perfecter is he. Sanctitas verò est interioris hominis perfectio; qua etiam totus homo perficitur. And Holineſſe is the Perfection of the inward man, whereby is made perfect the whole man. And therefore by Holineſſe and Perfectnes of life is God beſt Glorified, and moſt ſyncerely worſhipped.
            
            The Reaſon here of is plaine, as in the Perfection of other Creatures. For this Inward and Chiefe Perfection

ſtanding in Holineſſe, and in all kinde of Vertue and Godlineſſe ſheweth; that much more Holineſſe &amp; all kinde of Goodneſse belongeth vnto GOD, as a neere Attribute, who hath attributed ſo much thereof vnto men, as we ſee ſhining in their good life.

(He hath Glory enough in himſelfe, as being the Cauſe and Foūtain of all Glory, as before ye heard) But t'is his will to be Glorified by vs, that is, by our good Workes. According to that, Mat. 5. 16. (and the like is againe, 1. Pet. 2. 12.) That they may ſee your good workes, and Glorifie your Father which is in heaven. And this too, for our owne good, &amp; not

               for Gods. For, as the Sun hath no need of vs, but we of him: ſo God hath no need of our Glorifiyng of him, but we haue all neede of the Glory of God; of which we all come ſo ſhort. Rom. 3. 23. &amp;, as Elihu ſpeaketh, (Iob. 35. 6, 7, 8.) If thou ſinneſt, what doest thou againſt him? Yea, when thy ſinnes be many, what doeſt thou vnto him? If thou be righteous, what giueſt thou vnto Et homil 2. in Ioan. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  .him? or what receiveth he at thine hand? Thy wickednes may hurt a man as thou art: and thy righteouſneſſe may profit the ſonne of man. S. Chryſoſtome vpon that Rom. 1. 23, 25. (Where the Apoſtle telleth, how the Gentils turned, or changed the Glory, and the Truth of God) ſaith: 
               Super illud, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

               . They wronged the Truth and Glory of God, as much as in them lay. For indeed, let thē doe their worſt, they can not wrong God, who is the Truth;

               There being no ſhadow of turning or alteration with him, and he having in himſelfe his owne peculiar Glory perpetuall, and perpetually inviolable. And the Lily of the

               Maſſe ſaith wel, Gloriae Dei nullum eſt contrarium malum: quia de bono &amp; de malo reſultat Gloria Dei: &amp; de malo inquantum pungit, de bono inquantum remunerat. There is nothing that can croſſe or contrary the Glory of God, for that both good and evill redound to his Glory: the one by his revenging, the other by his rewarding of it.
            Next, let vs chaunge the name of Perfection into Beauty: Beauty Rationall and Intellectuall, as hath beene ſaid. Which ſeeing the Dayes do for their parts ſo preciſely maintaine, as hath beene declared: we that are Reaſonable and Intellectuall creatures, ought in all reaſon as curiouſly to preſerue on our parts: leaſt wee proue vnlike, not only to God, but even to our ſelues: and become more deformed then thoſe creatures, which God hath formed voyd of reaſon and of vnderſtanding.
            For that the Beautifying of our ſelues, the making of our ſelues Faire and Comely, the preſerving of our Beauty, the Trimming and Decking of our ſelues, is in vs too the ſetting forth of the Glory of our God. Hence is the Church of Chriſt, throughout every part thereof, deſcribed to be ſo Faire in the Canticles, chap. 4. ver. 1. Behold, thou art Faire my Loue: behold thou art Faire. And in the 7. verſe, Thou art all Faire my Loue. And ſo Faire in the 45. Pſalme, as that God himſelfe (ver. 12.) hath pleaſure in her Beauty.
            
            But then we muſt conſider too, Beloved, whereon

this faire Beauty ſtandeth, and wherein this Comelyneſſe conſiſteth.
            
               And we ſhall finde it to be that, wherein we ſaide conſiſted our Perfection. For, Quae maior hominis pulchritudo, ſaith Simon de Vbi ſupra.Caſſia, quàm vt obediat Deo? Certè dixerim nullam, &amp;c: What greater Beauty hath mā, then to obey God? I may well ſay, none at all. This, Salomon in the end of 
                  Cap. 12. v. 13.Eccleſiastes witneſſeth, ſaying, Feare God &amp; keepe his Commandements: this is every man, that is (ſaith he) for this End is every mā created, &amp; by this doth every man atchieue his chiefeſt comelyneſſe. Conſider every man ſeverally, and yee ſhall finde this to be all his Beauty, to be alwaies in 
                  Vid. Sap. 8. 3.preſence of the firſt and vnmarreable Beauty, &amp; that the created Faireneſse ſhould be ever neere the vncreated, &amp; the Cauſed neuer to be neere to leaue his Cauſe. And, as S. 
               Super Cantic. ſerm. 31.
               Bernard hath, Qui clarior, (claritatibus ſpiritualibus) ille propinquior: eſſe autem clariſſimum perveniſse eſt. &amp;c. The brighter and fairer a man is, (in Spirituall Beauty and Brightneſſe) the neerer he commeth vnto God: and to be Moſt Faire, is even to be Immortalitie maketh vs neere vnto God. Wiſ 6. 19preſent with God, to ſee him as he is, that is (ſaith he) to be as he is, &amp; aliqua diſſimilitudine non confundi, and not to be ſpeckled or ſpotted (as now wee are) with any vnlikeneſſe vnto GOD.
            
            Thus to be Most Faire, Most Perfect, and Moſt Glorious, is not for vs till after this life, and that therein firſt wee ſhall haue ſtrived for the poſitiue and comparatiue degree of Faireneſſe, Perfectneſſe, and Glory.
            
            
               But alas then for the Dayes, &amp; ſuch like creatures! This is not at all competible vnto them in the worlde

to come. By how much the more inexcuſable are we, if we ſuffer the Dayes ſo to outrunne vs in the Service of GOD, when as none but we haue the Reward propoſed vnto vs. What? ſhall the Greateſt glory redounde vnto vs, Beloved, and to none but vs? And why then can we endure, every part of every Day to do nothing elſe but ſhew forth Gods Glory; whileſt with vs

                  Epiſt. 1.Seneca ſpeaketh; The greateſt part of our life is ſpent in doing evill, a great part in doing nothing, but all in not doing that that ſhould be dōe, to Gods Glory, ſo as all things ſhould be done (1. Cor. 10. 31)—Forma Dies vitae, The Day reſembleth Life, ſaith 
               Carmin. in Geneſ.Hilary. I would, Beloved, our life did as well reſemble but the Day. Were I but a Nightingale, could 
               Arriar. Epict. lib. 1. cap. 17.
               Epictetus ſay, I ſhould doe the duty of a Nightingale: if a Swan, the duty of a Swan. But now that I paſse them, by being endowed with Reaſon: reaſon is, I ſhould Honour and Glorifie God. This indeed is My Dutie: this I doe, and will continue to doe, not giving over this charge of mine, vntill I be diſcharged of this life. For what can I, nay what ought I to doe elſe, but to extoll the Name of God, and to ſhew forth his Glory. If a Heathen man could ſay all this: what then, thinke you, ought each of vs Chriſtians to ſay, and to doe accordingly? If God had made me a Day, I ought to haue done the dutie of a Day; if a Night, the dutie of a Night: And that had beene, To ſhewe forth Gods glory; But now that he hath created me after his owne Image, &amp; therefore more liuely to expreſſe his Glory, according to that 1. Cor. 11. 7. He is the Image &amp; Glory of GOD: ſo making

me to excell the Day in more then Reaſon, yea &amp;, more then was reaſon, making mee a promiſe of an Everlaſting Crowne of Glory, if I would but for a ſhort ſeaſon ſhew forth his Glory; reaſon is, if reaſon be for any thing, that I, I more then any thing, ſhould ſet forth the Praiſe, the Honour, and the Glory of my GOD. This indeed is my dutie: for this am I most of all obliged vnto GOD: this I doe, and doing will doe continually, not deſerting this dutie of mine, vntill I ſhall haue paid nature her laſt duties. For what can I, nay what ought I to doe elſe, ſo long as I haue any being, but to glorify GOD the author of my being, and of my well being; beginning it here in this life, which in the life to come ſhall bee perfited; here longing, &amp; thither looking for to come, where being

               HAving in the Subiect of the Days Speech already ſpoken of the Glory of GOD in Generall, how it is reported by them: we are now, by the ſame guidance of our GOD as before, to deſcend with the Prophet David, to ſome excellent Particulars of GODS Glory vttered by the ſame Reporters. Like vnto thoſe, who, hauing left the main Ocean, are now entered into an arme or creeke of the Sea neerer home; or like thoſe, who for a while haue beene lifted vp to ſee the flame of a great fire, but afterwards let downe againe, can ſtill behold the Sparkles

               Before, One Day told [The Glory of God] vnto another, Now, One Day telleth [a Word] vnto another. Illud incertum

eſſe apparet, de quo verbo, &amp; qua Scientia loquatur hic verſus, ſaith Wolfgangus Muſculus on this place. It is vncertaine what Word is here meant, that one Day telleth another; as alſo, what Knowledge one Night is in this verſe ſaid to teach another. And he propoſeth two Acceptions.
            
            
               Either that there ſhould be vnderſtood The Word of God, by which the Heavens were made, and The Knowledge of God, whereby they were moſt cunningly made; or elſe, The Word of the Heavens, of the Dayes, and of the Nights predicating GODS Glory. And he ſaith, that this latter ſeemeth vnto him to be ſimplicior; (the ſimpler, or the plainer) yet ſo, vt dictione Scientiae, quam indicari dicit, non eam qua nos Deum cognoſcimus, ſed qua Deus coelos ſumma ſapientia condidit ac diſpoſuit, intelligamus. That by the Word [Knowledge] which one Night is ſaid to teach another, we vnderſtand not that Knowledge by which we knowe God: but that Knowledge, by which God after his moſt excellent wiſdome made and diſpoſed of the Heavens.
            But who ſeeth not, Beloved, that this moſt excellent knowledge of GOD leadeth vs to that other, which is, our knowledg of God? as alſo, that the knowledge whereby we knowe GOD, againe conducteth vs to that knowledge whereby GOD made the world? Like as whē in a Regreſſe Demonſtratiue, we firſt demonſtrate the Cauſe by the Effect; &amp; then againe the Effect by the Cauſe. So that it commeth all to one, whether of thoſe two knowledges wee there vnderſtand.
            
               Againe, to propoſe two meanings of Worde, and
               
Knowledge here: and for the word, Word, to embrace the latter; but for the worde, Knowledge, to entertaine the former: (as here Muſculus doth) what elſe is it, but indeed to embrace &amp; entertaine both? both? yea, Beloued, and ſo we may, &amp; muſt too, accept of a Word here in my Text in both theſe ſenſes: vnleſſe we will be very extravagant from a whole ſtreame of Interpreters of beſt note. And t'is the rule of S. Auſtin, conf. l. 12. c. 31. Cū alius dixerit, hoc ſenſit quod ego: et ali, Imo illud quod ego: Relligioſius me arbitror dicere, cur nō vtrum

                  •
                &amp; ſi quid tertium, &amp; ſi quid quartū &amp;c. When one ſaith, Such a thing is vnderſtood by ſuch a place of Scripture: another ſaith, another thing is thereby vnderſtood: I hold it the more religious courſe for me to ſay, and why not rather both, if both be true? yea, if a third, or if a fourth meaning? And, 
               Ibid. Auguſt.Vnus Deus ſacras liter as vera &amp; diverſa viſuris multorum ſenſibus temperavit. God hath ſo tempered the Scriptures, as that hee hath made them fit for diverſe vnderſtandings, ſo long as they are true. And, in his firſt booke, de Geneſ. ad liter. the 18th Chapter: Si qua ſcripta divina legerimus, quae poſſint, ſalva fide, qua imbuimur, alijs at

Yea or, with praeiudicing of the reſt: as himſelfe ſaith afterwardes of himſelfe, in the 20th Chap. Nō aliquid vnum temerè affirmans cū praeiudicio alterius expoſitionis fortaſse melioris, &amp;c. Not

               better.
            Becauſe of all which, Beloved, I intend (God willing) to proſecute the Word, that here One Day is ſaid to tell another, not only in thoſe two ſenſes laſt aboue mentioned; but in ſome ſeeming other, agreeable to wholſome doctrine, conſonant to the circumſtances of my Text, and not at all diſſenting from, or preiudicing the moſt commonly receaued interpretations; rather keeping my ſelfe to the libertie of the word, then any way either to impriſon it, or the riches of the Obſervations that ariſe from it; as one M.

Cor. 14. 10Apoſtle) ſo many kindes of voyces in the world, and none of them is without ſignification. Surely no. Nor without Signification of the Glory of God. In the ſhewing forth whereof: ſee here, how the world hath from time to time profited by Languages.
            
            The time was when, Gen 11. 1. By Ʋnitie thereof,
               The whole Earth was of one Language, and of one Speach. And Then did One Day tell another the Glory of God, by that One Speach, or Language. Vnder which GOD wrought ſo many wonderfull works, and whereby He, the author of that vnion, did then the better enable the Nations to vnitie of Mindes in the true worſhip of him, and to the attaining

to the Knowledge of the Truth with more facility. But when they abuſed that Vnion, and that eaſie way of getting vnderstanding, (by vnderſtanding all that was ſpoken in the world) to Proud &amp; Preſumptuous Aſſociation and Confederacie: Thē alſo GOD declared his Power, in Confounding their Language, and making ſuch a By Confuſion thereof,
               Diviſion among them, as was never heard of in the world, and which their vnheard of Malice and Preſūption brought vpō them; That one of them vnderſtood not the other: So to giue them to vnderſtand their dutie by Diuiſion and Want of vnderſtanding, which before they would not learne by Vnion of Speech and vnderſtanding. Yet even then too, the Powerfull Wiſdome and Goodneſſe of GOD proceeded on ſtill to the farther manifeſtation of it ſelfe, by that Confuſion and Diuiſion of Speech: even at that Day, out of that Babeling Infancy 
               By Diſtinction and Diſtinct Multiplicity thereof, out of that Confuſion:of the world Ordaining his Praiſe. His Praiſe: In producing afterwards Distinct Knowledge out of that Confuſion, as it were Light out of Darkneſſe; making it appeare every Day more and more vnto the world, by the enſuing Multiplicitie of Languages, which in Times enſuing were alſo vnderſtood, How Well he could Teach, that had ſo well Divided. How out of the Mouthes of Such Infants, as Men then were, and ever would bee, but that God Teacheth them, hee could ſo well Divide vnto the World, &amp; Diſperſe 
               According to one ſignification of 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , for which 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   is alſo put.
               His Praiſe of Knowledge. He ſtill preſerued Knowledge, that was Good, in the midſt of that Diviſion; yea and increaſed it thereby: making afterwards Diverſe Languages and the Guift of Tongues, a meanes of dividing greater Knowledge, and more ample

               By preſervation therof, in the midſt of that Confuſion. 
               Declaration of his Glory to the world. To which rightly appertaineth, the ſtraunge and admirable preſervatiō of ſo much of the Hebrew Tongue (the Speech, as is moſt approued, that firſt was in the world, and in the which Gods Word was written) in the midſt, not only of that Babels 
               Lingua Hebraea in Diviſione Gentium per loquelam ſo la populo ad Dei culium pertinē
                  te remāſit. Sim. de caſſ. lib. 13. Vid. Bertram. in praefat. in cō

               Confuſion, nor only of the Aegyptiacall Affliction of the Hebrewes, but alſo of that after-Confuſion &amp; Mixture of the Language of the Hebrews, in their Idolatrous Familiaritie &amp; Commerce with the Aſſyrians, and in their Babyloniſh and Chaldeiſh Captiuities; It appearing thereby, and One Day telling another, That not only The Word of the Lord endureth foreuer, but alſo that Speech and Language, in which The Worde of the Lord 
               In illa locutus eſt Chriſtus, &amp; mundum docuit qu
                     •
                   neſciebat. Sim. de Caſſ. vbi ſuprà. Gods Glory by Extraordinary and Miraculous Speach:
               Spake, or was Deliuered, is ſo farre forth kept inviolable to the End of the world.
            
               One Day telleth a Word, or Speech vnto another.] Hereout iſſueth now farther into our diſcourſe and conſideration, Extraordinarie, &amp; Miraculous Speech: whereby GOD for the farther Ordination of his praiſe hath afforded vnto men moſt wonderfull Inſtructions; That ſo they, with whom the Word of GOD ſpoken by the Ordinarie Admirable Speech and Language of Men &amp; of the World will not prevaile: yet, by the vttering of it by Extraordinarie and Miraculous Speech, aboue the Speech of Men, or the Perſonous Perſonated Speech of the World, may bee enforced to the Ever Hallowing of his Name.
            
            
               By the Gift of Diverſe Tongues: Hence was the Guift of Speaking Diverſe Languages ſo miraculouſſy beſtowed on the Apoſtles (Act. 2.) for the Promulgation of the Glorious Goſpell of Ieſus

Chriſt, and of the wonderfull Workes of GOD. To which, as to a moſt ſtrangely vouchſafed meanes, we that are partakers of the Goſpell, and of the Spirit of Grace, owe no leſſe then that Participation; and therefore owe the giuing of Great Glory vnto God in that behalfe. In reſpect whereof, One Day doth ſo tell the Glory of GOD vnto another, That diverſe, induced alſo by that Rom. 10. 18. Where the 4th verſe of this Pſalme is alleaged, haue by the Dayes here in my Text vnderſtood Chriſt and his Apoſtles, Christ Telling his Apoſtles (as formerly ye heard In the firſt Sermon.) or elſe Chriſts Twelue Apostles: who, like vnto the Twelue Houres of the Day, by that Light, that he the Brighteſt Sunne infuſed into them, eſpecially by the Effuſion of His Holy Spirit, and conferring the Guift of Diverſe Languages vpon them, Preached The Knowledge of Saluation to people of All Tongues and Languages.
            
            And here wee may note their vnthankfulneſſe and raſh iudgement, who, contrary to the Rule of the Apoſtle (1. Cor. 14. 39.) diſlike and forbid Speaking with Tongues; ſo farre forth, as that one Word, or Sentence in the Church, in another Tongue then theirs, although with Interpretation annexed, doth offend them. They being of like Superſtition for their owne Tongue, as others are and haue beene for the Hebrew, Greeke, and Latine. And they, who before could not be ſuffered to haue any Service in their owne Tongue, now not willingly ſuffering any one Word in Sermon, or Bible, to be out of their owne Tongue. When as the retaining of ſome Words in another Language, eſpecially by common

vſe and Explication vnderſtood, maketh much for A dification, and for the Glorious Building of Gods Praiſe. For (to omit many other reaſons) thoſe Wordes, yea, or Sentences, are they not, like vnto the Reſerved Manna, a Signe and Memoriall vnto vs that Beleeue, of Gods Good Will towards vs, in that he hath made choice of vs alſo, to call vs to the knowledge of the Truth by meanes of Diuerſe Tongues, Vnderstood and Interpreted? &amp; in that, from former Darkneſſe, he hath brought vs to ſuch plentie of Light in him, and hath, by the Report of his Glory, ſo richly and Superabundantly furniſhed vs with Knowledge in our own Tongue; That we haue now ſomewhat to ſpare from our owne neceſſarie vſes, to lay vp in his Glorious Golden 
               Her. 9▪ 4.
               pot, in Signe of Thankfulneſſe? Like as doth our Mother Vniverſitie; whoſe Latin ſeemeth now to bee turned into Gold, Gold of GODs Glory; whilſt, in the time of the Spirituall Vintage of Good-Wine, it doth of late make Latine Hymnes of GODs Glory to be the Prefixes of the Latine Sermons of His Glory. Wherein, among other commē
               dable enſignements, appeareth a Signe of Thankfulnes vnto GOD. Without which, it is to be feared leaſt GOD returne vs, among others, That Signe of his diſpleaſure, To ſpeake vnto vs with men of other Tongues, and with other Lips: and that the rather, becauſe of our Iudaizing, that is, our Obſtinacie, our Vnbeleefe, and Diſobedience, in regard of The Report of GODs Glory, which Every Day bringeth vnto vs, both in our Owne &amp; other 
               Rom. 10. 16. &amp; vid. Ioh. 12 37 38, &amp;c.
               Languages. In ſo much that ſtill it may bee ſaid of all in generall, They haue not all Obeyed the Goſpell: and, Lord,

who hath beleeued our Report? Yea; When the Sonne 
               Luk, 18. 8.
               of Man commeth, ſhall he finde Faith on Earth? notwithſtanding ſo many wayes of ſpeaking, and ſo many kindes of Tongues and Languages; by the Hearing and vnderſtanding of which in all their variety, variety Extraordinary and Miraculous, GOD hath laboured to make Men to Beleeue. 
               By the Speech of Superiors; Angels,
            
            For hence it is too, that GOD hath divers times ſpoken vnto Men by Angels. Angels? And would no other ſerue the turne? Would not all the Speach and Languages ſpoken by all the People of the Earth, and manie of them Priests and Prophets too, ſuffice? Is man ſo bad a Scholler, ſo dull of 
               Heb. 5, 11.
               Hearing and of vnderſtanding? Then hath he ſo much the more to anſwere for, if nether the Speach of Angels may make the word of God to fructifie within him. 
                  Heb. 2. &amp; the Lord of Angels.
               For the word of God Spokē by Angels was ſtedfaſt, and every Tranſgreſſion and Diſobedience received a iuſt recompence of reward. And If ſo (ſaith the Apoſtle) How ſhall we eſcape, if we Neglect ſo great Salvatiō, which at the firſt begā to be Spoken by the Lord, &amp;c? And, chap. 1. ver. 2. God hath in theſe laſt Dayes Spokē
                
               Mat. 21. 38, 37.
               vnto vs by his Sonne, &amp;c: his Sonne &amp; Heire: whoſe ſpeach, of all others, we ſhould Reverence. Here is the Speach of one that is Greater then the Angels. And will you heare the Speach of thoſe that are Leſſer thē the Angels? All ſhewing forth the powerfulneſſe of By the Speech of Inferiors:his Speach that is the Greateſt, and conferring a ſtill Appoſite Appoſition to his Glory.
            
            
               Mē; Dumb, &amp; Infants. 
               One Day telleth another.] For that God hath ſometimes made the Dumbe to ſpeake, and taught an Infant
               
in an Inſtant to Speake wiſely. And whē (not to ſpeak of All the Dumb that Chriſt endowed with Speach) he made the Children to Cry in the Temple, Hoſanna to the Sonne of David. (Mat. 21. 15.) To which Christ him ſelfe (verſ. 16.) applyeth that of the 8. Pſalme: Out of the Mouth of Infants (or, Babes) and Sucklings haſt thou 
               
                  Vt Pſal. 8. 2. &amp; Heb. 10. 5. See all the Significatiōs of 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . 
               Prepared, Ordeined, Fitted, Fitly compoſed, and (according to the Hebrew) Founded thy praiſe. A weake Foū
                  dation, to build vpon; eſpecially Such a worke of Such a Founder. The Foundation being ſometimes no better then a Babell, or Confuſion. But ſo did he ſometimes out of a leſſe matter (by as much as Nothing is leſſe then Any Thing) make All Things, and All Things to His Glory. So is his power made perfect through weaknes. (2. Cor. 12. 9.) So hath he choſen the Fooliſh things of the world to Confound the Wiſe, and the Weake to confound the Mighty, &amp;c. 1. Cor. 1. 27. That no Fleſh ſhould Glory in His preſence.
            
            It is there alſo worth the obſervation; how that thoſe words, Out of the Mouth of Infants, &amp;c: are inſerted in the Second verſe of the 8. Pſalme, betweene the firſt and third verſes, in which the Prophet magnifieth Gods Glory in conſideration of the Heauens, &amp; ſuch like workes of his, and his Ordeining; As alſo the words of my Text are, in the ſecond verſe of this Pſalme, interpoſed Sun, Moon, Starr, Heavē, &amp; Day-Infants;betweene the firſt verſe, and the reſt; in which the Heauens too, and ſuch like Creatures, are brought in for the Declaration of Gods Glory. As though the Heavens too, and the Dayes of Heauen, the Sunne, the Moone,

the Starres, the Firmament, and the reſt, were to be reckoned among thoſe Babes and Infants, out of whoſe Mouthes, together with others, hee hath Appointed the predication and perfect Compoſition of his prayſes. And as though that ſecond verſe of the 8. Pſalme might ſerue to Parallell my Text, in the Dayes Parliament of Gods 
               Theſe Infants Parliament.
               Prayſes.
            
            And here we may not omit, to bring in the Sunne and the Moone, the Dayes &amp; the Nights, as it were Kings with their Nobility, in their Extraordinary Attire and Parliamentall Robes, moſt wonderfully and Miraculouſly Testifying the Glory of their Creatour, &amp; our Redeemer.
            Among other things ſo Strangly Enacted by them;  we haue in moſt infallible Recorde, That Worke, that Things there Enacted.
               Strange worke of the Lords, That Act of his, that Strange Act of His (Iſai. 28. 21.) Whereby the Sunne, at His Bidding, ſtood ſtill in Gibeon, and the Moone in the Valley of Aialon. The Sunne, that otherwiſe, &amp; in This Pſalme, fo Swiftly &amp; with ſuch Alacrity Runneth his Courſe; yet There, by the ſame Commanunding power, had no power to proceede, was put to a Demurre, Abode in the midſt of the Heaven, and Haſted not to goe downe for a Whole Day. And there was no Day like that Day before it, nor after it (Ioſh. 10. 12, 13.) When One Day was as Long as Two (Eccleſiaſticus, 46. 4.) One Day went beyond it ſelfe in Lauding the Lord: and loſt his owne proper Name, in Magnifying the Name of the Creatour. For how ſhould it haue any longer the Name of Day, that was ſo much Longer then a Day, &amp; was nether Artificial, nor

               Naturall? Yet is it ſtiled Such a Day, as the like was never before it, nor after it. A Day of more then Ordinary Continuance, in his Luminous &amp; Voluminous Expoſitiō of his Makers Glory, by obſerving his Ordinance: And therfore Dignified with the Name of None-Such, and to be of an Higher Order then the reſt.
            Here men may learne, to preferre the Glory of Gods Name before their owne; To approue themſelues the Miniſters and Servants of Reporting Gods Honour, by their Honour and Diſhonour, by Evill Report, and good 
               2. Cor. 6.
               Report: That the loſſe of Name or Reputation for God and Godlyneſſe, for the Glorious Goſpels ſake, &amp; in the Service of ether, ſhall be with manifold advātage reſtored them in this Life, and that that is to come; Laſtly, that the beſt way to get Extraordinary Precedencie and Reputation, and an Excellent Name aboue others, is by Exceeding others in Paines and Induſtry, by Extraordinary Points and Exploits of Gods Service, &amp; by Keeping his Commaundements, whether in things Ordinary or Extraordinary, with Ordinary and Extraordinary Endeavour.
            
            
               All this we are better taught, then by all this: even by The Day and Sunne Christ Ieſus; who as he was imployed in the Moſt Extraordinary Works of GODS Glory, and therein demeaned himſelfe with Moſt Extraordinary Obedience, and loſſe of Worldly Reputatirn, not Seeking his Own Glory: ſo is he alſo Moſt Highly Exalted, &amp; Phil. 2. Heb. 1.hath obtained Moſt Extraordinaoy Appellations, a Moſt Excellent Name, and A Name aboue Every Name, vnto The Glory of God the Father.
            
               
Another ſtrāge Work of Gods Enacted by the Sun, &amp;  by the Day, was: The Suns, not Stāding Still, as before, but Going Tē Degrees Backward, in the time of King Hezekiah 
               Iſai, 38. &amp;, 2. Chr. 20..A wōderful Retrogradatiō of the Sū, that was ſo Senſible in a Sū Diall. A ſtrange Reiournemēt of the Suns Dayes Iourney; of the Iournal, or Day-Booke, and of the Dayes Parliamēt of Gods Glory. On which both the Sū &amp; his People are ſtill ready to Dance their Attendance, whether it be by Tracing Ordinarily Forward, or Extraordinarily Backward, or elſe by Stāds &amp; Pauſes Supernaturall. Yea and the Sun-Day, the beſt of all others, is the beſt of all others for this Dauncing. Hee that went more then Ten, or Ten Thouſand Degrees Backward by his Humiliation, is our beſt leader and teacher in Going Forwarde, in Standing Still, and Going Backward, and in Going Forward by Standing Still, &amp; Going Backward. When as yet we Men and women, the Glory of GOD Inviting and Commanding vs, will not Mat 11. 17.
               Daunce: will neither Goe Ordinarily Forward in our Callings with Perſeverāce, nor, croſſing our Corrupt Nature, Stand Still with Extraordinary Patience, nor Goe Extraordinarily Backward with Humilitie.
            
            
                A third thing Enacted was The Darknes, which, when Chriſt Crucified, was over all the Earth, from the Sixt Houre vnto the Ninth Houre 
               Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luk. 23.. When as The Sun was Darkned: (Luk. 23. 45.) Darkned with a Super naturall Eclipſe; both in reſpect of the Cauſe thereof, and of the Time that it Laſted. The Cauſe: whether it were; The Moone Miraculauſly Capering to and fro, from the point of Oppoſition to Cloſing in Coniunction with the Sun As Dionyſ. Areopagit. who diligently obſerued it ſeemeth to relate. Clavius likewiſe ſaith (vpon Iohn de Sacr. Boſc. cap. 4 pag 531.) 
                     
                        •

Mens Sight and the Sunne, was the Iniquitie, Infidelitie, Crueltie, and Ignorance of the Iewes, which was then and afterwards at the Full: And was then, &amp; hath beene ever ſince too neere allied to the Taile &amp; Head of the Old Dragon: As alſo the Indignity and Compaſsion that the Sunne, the Moone, and the Day were then moued withall; not induring as it were to hold the candle, or to giue Light, at the offering of ſuch hainous Iniury to their Creatour: no, nor to ſhew thē
               ſelues in their Ordinary Glad and Light Garments; but being themſelues alſo clad in Sad Mourning Weedes of Darkneſſe, where they ſaw ſuch Deeds of Darkneſse, and The Lord of their Light to be ſo full of Dolours, Soliſ
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   Labores: And their Sun to be ſo pained, in his being pawned &amp; puniſhed for vs: The Day as it were Diſdaining and Diſclaiming thoſe Houres to be any of his, wherein The Lord of Glory ſhould be Crucified: &amp; being contented, for Chriſts ſake, to looſe, by an Eclipſe, Three Howres of that little Time of his life, that conſiſteth but of Twelue.
            The Cauſe of that Contentedneſse of The Day, was another, if not the only Cauſe of that Eclipſe▪
                namely, That men might thereby the better Scan The Glory, and The Power of Chriſts Deitie. That, as the Sunne was then ſo Extraordinarily and Supernaturally Obſcured: ſo he was an Extraordinary and Supernaturall Sun, The Sunne of Righteouſneſſe, that Suffered. That, as whē the Sunne is Eclipſed, The Taile or Head of the Dragon is very Neerely Touched: ſo the Eclipſing of This Sun and Sonne of God, by his Humiliation and Sufferings,
               
ſhould thereby proue to bee His Godheads Breaking of the Serpents Head. That the Ordinary Sun Gaue Place, and hid his head, as it were from God Almightie, when That Sun was once Exalted no higher thē 
               The Croſſe. That well may the Ordinarie Sunne Shew his Greatest Countenance in his Loweſt Eſtate: yet he cannot ſhew ſo great Power in his Higheſt, as Chriſt ſhewed in his Lowest. That His Setting may haue that which of Two Hen. 2. and Rich. 1. vid. Cābd. in fol. pag. 206.others is verſified, of it ſelfe alone beſt verified: Mira cano: Sol occubuit, Nox nulla ſequuta est. A wonder t'is to Tell: Sun ſet, no Night befell. Yea and this Sunnes Setting was ſuch, as brought More Day, and Greater Light vnto the whole World, then ever the Sun of the World did to One Halfe of the World, at the Higheſt point of his Liberall Diſtribution of Light vnto the Day. That His Deſcending was to ſuch a Place, where the Serpent Pythō
                might haue lyen ſafe enough, for ever any other Phoebus being able to come neere to hurt him. Laſtly, That, as the Brightneſſe &amp; Glory of the Temporall Sun doth after a ſort Demonſtrate the Supernaturall Splendor and Glory of that Eternall: (according to what heretofore hath bin ſpoken) ſo the World being thus Depriued of the Sun and Day-Light, by a Supernaturall Eclipſe, argueth The Departure of the Eternall Sun out of the World by a Strange way: a Way, whereof his Godhead was vncapeable; and yet a Way Supernaturally munited with ſuch Coūtermands of Nature, as were competible and poſſible to none, but the Divine Nature.
            
            This Dionyſius Areopagita, being a Philoſopher, was

able to collect out of that Eclipſe. Who, as Hiſtory relates, being in Athens, and ſeeing there that ſtrange Eclipſe, brake out into theſe words: Either the God of Nature doth now ſuffer, or elſe the World ſhall be Diſſolued. The Athenians too themſelues, as t'is reported, by the ſtrangeneſſe of that Eclipſe, coniectured ſomwhat more then ordinary concerning The Godhead, and The worſhipping of him, though Ignorantly: and therevpon erected an Altar with that Inſcriptiō, To the vnknowne God. Act. 17. 23.
            Out of all which there ariſe vnto vs theſe ēſuing Lights of Inſtruction, &amp; Articles of Admonition, drawn out of the Parliamentall Act of the Darkneſſe of One Day.
            
            
                That not the very Bonds of Nature, or of Naturall Affection, ſhould tie vs ſo faſt, ſhould bee ſo deere, or goe ſo neere vnto vs, as The Glory of GOD, in our Obeying his Commandements, &amp; his Countermands. And that we ſhould be like our Father Abraham: who, vpon the Appearing of the Command of The God of Glory, Got him out of his Countrey, from his Kinred, &amp; from his Fathers houſe, vnto another countrey, and from place to place, not Knowing whether he went (Heb. 11. 8.) vntill he came, where he had not a foot of inheritance. Yea and, cauſing Naturall Affection to ſtoope to the Affecting &amp; Effecting of GODS Glorious Commād, he Offered his Sonne, his only Sonne Iſaac. And yet woe is vs, that are ſo farre off from Forſaking Father &amp; Mother, and the reſt that Naturally we are addicted vnto, for the procuring of GODS Glory; that wee will not, at his commandement, Offer vnto him that which coſteth

vs little or nothing, and is not Repugnant, but Agreeable to any, but our Corrupt Nature.
            
                That we are very blameable, that will not looſe, or rather finde (for Hee that ſo looſeth his life, ſhall finde it) ſome few Dayes or Howers of our Life, that conſiſteth of  ſo many yeeres, in the Maintaining of Gods Glory.
            That we take heed of Iewiſh Infidelitie, Crueltie, Iniquitie, Ignorance, and more then Iewiſh Crucifying Againe vnto our ſelues The Lord of Glory, and making a mocke of him. For feare leaſt, if our Deeds draw neere againe to the Taile or Head of the Old Dragon, in being like vnto Darkneſſe, and Symbolizing with the Divle, or his Members; God ſtrike vs with more then Aegyptian Exod. 10. 21 which may bee alſo reckoned among the Acts of This Parliament. As alſo the Star that directed the wiſemen to Chriſt, Mat. 2Darkneſſe; and the Light that now (GOD bee Glorified) we haue, be taken from vs, our Sun &amp; Moone be Eclipſed, our Day bee turned into Night, and the Length of our Dayes, both here and in the Land of Promiſe, be elipped off, more then Three 
               So Long laſted the Darkneſſe at Chriſts Crucifying; as is aboue ſpecified.
               Houres, or, Three Dayes 
               So long the Aegyptian Darkneſſe..
            
               That wee ſhould gladly Suffer together with Chriſt, that, being conformable to his paſſions, Wee may alſo  Reigne together with him.
            
                That we ought To Conforme our ſelues vnto the time of Christs paſsion: not to paſſe it in mirth and iollitie, but in weeping for our ſelues, in chaſtiſing of our ſelues by true Poenitencie, without Sparing of our ſelues; our Sinfull ſelues, who by our Doings haue put Chriſt to his Sufferings. The moſt ſeaſonable and reaſonable celebration whereof is not in Feaſting, but in Faſting, Praying, Prayſing, Preaching, and the like: neither

in standing farre off in worldly Oppoſition, but in Drawing neere, with Soul and Body, vnto the Righteous Sun; who is neerer to vs then the Heavens, even ſo Neere as in our Hearts and in our Mouthes; (Rom. 10.) and, as that In Him we Liue, and Moue, and haue our Being. Act. 17. Likewiſe, To be Serviceable and Applyable vnto the other Dayes of the Lord, the Dayes with Eſpeciall A Day in thy Courts is better then a Thouſand. Pſal. 84. 10. &amp; See hereof, pag. 10, 11, &amp; 13.Happines Deſtinated &amp; Appointed for the Service of the Lord, &amp; The Declaration of his Glory, for ſome Extraordinary Benefits beſtowed on his Creatures. Thē to Reioice with them that Reioice, &amp; not to be like to thoſe, who (according to the Arabiā 
               See thereof, the Learned Erpenius; in his Expoſition of Arabian Proverbs.proverb) Looſe a Margarite vpon the Festivall Day; yea thē looſe the vnion of the Spirit, &amp; ſo (t'is to be feared) the moſt precious pearle of the Kingdome Heaven. Whileſt they can not brooke the Church, or ſome that are in it, or the way vnto it, vpon the Holy Dayes: when eſpecially we ought to goe, though it were a farther &amp; a harder way, from the vtmoſt partes of Iury to Ieruſalem, from the blindeſt corner of Diſſenſion to the ſight of peace, from our owne Houſes to GODS Houſe, and the place where His Honour Dwelleth. Then, and There Spiritually-Supernaturally to Leape For Heaven, To it, From that which is moſt Oppoſite vnto it: To reſigne our Worldly Buſineſſes and Delights; which by the Interpoſition of Earthly Cogitations, doe diſioyne &amp; ſeparate vs, even vpon the Sunday, from our Lighteſt Sū
                and Brightest Day, as it were by the whole length of the Diameter of Heavenly and Eternall Things.
            
                That it behoveth vs, to hasten away from thoſe points

of Oppoſition, wherein we Chriſtians, ether Prince or People, ſtand, while Chriſt is Crucified; to Spirituall vnity and Coniunction: the better to reclaime, or repreſſe, the common profeſſed Enimies of Chriſt, and to debarre them of their meanes of wronging Gods Glory.
            
                That we beware of Giving our holy Light vnto Dogs, and caſting the Pearles of the kingdome of heaven before Swine. That we open not the Doore to let filthy Sodomites come in; but, like Angels of Light, ſtrike ſuch Vid. Sap. 19. 17.ſuch Light-Angels with Blindneſſe, &amp; take away the Light of their Eies from thē, that they may not finde the Doore, nor the Way into the Houſe. Seeing their comming is fot no other, but villanouſly to Abuſe, &amp; to deale vnnaturally with the Houſe, the Lord of the Houſe, and thoſe within it that are the Lords. Seeing alſo that their ſaying, Haile Maiſter, yea and Kiſſing of Chriſt too, is but to Betray him, to catch him, ſtrike him, and miſvſe him. And their Rabſhaketh-like ſpeaking the language of the people of God, is but to Raile and to Diſhonour him.
            
                
               That we Loue not that which God hateth, whether it be the world, or the things that are in the world: cheriſh not his Enimies in his preſence: nor be Favourites &amp; Abettours of Notorious Offenders, and Excommunicated perſons. No: nor Grace them with the Light ſo much as of our Company, or Countenance. But, David▪
               like, to be Companiōs of thoſe that Feare the Lord: Vid. etiam Pſ. 29.to let the Righteous reſort vnto our Company: to let no vngodly perſon Dwell, or Tary in our Houſes; no, not ſo much as him that telleth Lyes: to hate them that hate the

Lord, and to bee Grieved with thoſe that riſe vp againſt him; yea; to hate them right ſore, as though they were our Enimies.
            
                Laſtly, That We muſt be zealous for our Heavenly Fathers Glory. Shewing that we are not Implicitè only, or in groſſe, but indeed and Expreſly in loue with GOD: by having the pulſe of our Conſcience Extraordinarilie Moved, with Ioy, whē we ſee God Glorified; or els with Diſdaine, Sorrow, and Impatience, when we ſee His Name and Truth Blaſphemed. Then it is our part to do as Craeſus his ſonne is ſaid to haue done: who, having beene alwaies dumbe, yet ſpake ſuddainely, when hee ſaw his Father ſet vpon. Or rather, to imitate the Son of God himſelfe: who otherwiſe being Iſai 53. 7.
               dumb, and not opening his mouth, yet ſpake, and ſpake as no man ever ſpake, in the behalfe of his Fathers Glory; yea and was in an Extraordinary faſhion Eaten vp with the zeale of his Fathers

               Houſe.
            
            How then is it, that wee are ſo Senſeleſſe in the wrongs that to GOD are offered? why rather, whē we perceaue God to be ſo highly Diſhonoured and Blaſphemed; among other things, by Hereticall Diſparagement to his Sonnes Deitie: and more then Iewiſh Crucifying of him: why, I ſay, doe we not Start, and Startle, and Leape, though it be from one end of the Heaven to the other, to Ioyne with others in the hindering of the Wrongs offered to the Sonne of GOD? In ſo doing doe yee Glory ſtill more and more, my Deerely Beloued: And you eſpecially, the Higheſt among Chriſtians, that are out of this Auditorie, and yet in The Parts of

the Dayes Speech are, though not the Principall Verbs, yet the Principall Praepoſitions; doe you, I humbly Exhort you, put your Royall Aſſents to the Dayes: Acts of Parliamēt of Prayſes of the Higheſt King, &amp; Most Praiſeworthy. That not only Iom le Iom, One Day vnto Another, but one [Le Roy le veult] vnto Annother, may Royally Recount and Ecchoize His Glory. Whileſt, like Zealous Ruling Lights (of as High Parentage, &amp; of as Ancient Creation as the Heavens) like Ben-Iamins (Great Kings, &amp; Vid. Pſ. 68. 27.Little Sonnes of Gods Right Hand of Iealouſie) like Zealous and Obedient Dayes, or The Arabian word for Day, here vſed.
               Iamins (that are ſtill a Telling and Enacting) &amp; like Zealous Iohns and Iameſes (that are ſtill a Mark 3. 17.Thundring out of Working &amp; of Loving) you make your ſelues ſtill more and more the Fervent Interiections of the Diſhonour of I AM. The Maintaining of whoſe Honour is the Charge that is impoſed on you. Decline it not, you most Princely Praepoſitions, but Incline your ſoules and hearts vnto it: That When Chriſt your Life 
               Col. 3. 4.
               ſhall appeare, you may haue the Glory of Not being Declined by him.
            
            
                A fourth thing Enacted by the Heavens and their Lights, the Dayes and the Nights, is The Darkning of the Sun, The Moone not giving her Light, The Starres falling from Heaven, and The Powers of Heauen being ſhaken (Mat. 24. 29.) Which Shall be, but little before Chriſts comming and the end of the World. Whereof that ſuch things muſt needes bee Prognoſticating Signes, The later part of the aforeſai

Here are Signes Extraordinarie of Declining Dayes. Darke Blindneſſe in the Lighteſt, Falling Sicknes in the Firmeſt, and Shaking Palſeies in the Powers of moſt Stedfaſtnes. All here, not The Dayes only, but the Lights of Heauen, and the Powers of Heaven, ſhall make apparant ſhew of their Decay; By Diverſe Defects, Strange Appearances, vnvſuall Changes, and Manifold Infirmities. Not by Eclipſes onely, but by

And How long doth it Expect and Wait? So long, as that it may well teach men Long Suffering and Patience.

            But now you Heavens, and you Lights of Heaven; you Light and Darkneſſe, you Telling Dayes and Certifying

Nights, What is become of all your Stedfaſtnes and Conſtancie, which wee haue heretofore ſo much commended? Shall it be reported of you, that you failed in your Laſt Reports of all? And will you be ſo Deficient in the Laſt Act of all of All your Parliament? O, no. But then much more by your Defects, Changes, and Infirmities, will Gods Power be made Perfect. Which only is Everlasting: who is able to Diminiſh not only Mans, but Your abilitie, to abate Your ſtrength, and to ſhorten Your Time, for all your Everlaſting Permanencie: And, for all your Stedfaſtneſſe; yet by your Mutabilitie, to declare, that he only is Immutable: By your Vnfaithfulneſſe, compared vnto Him, yea and by your Iob. 25.
               Impuritie in His Sight; to make it good, that he only is Good, and Faithfull, and Pure. Even as the Wiſdome alſo of his Angels is, in reſpect of him, but a foile of Folly, to Magnifie His Wiſdome.
            
            So then you, Dayes, (and likewiſe, you, the reſt) will not Then, in your Old Dayes, &amp; Dayes of your Greateſt Infirmities, after ſo many Succeſſions, and when your Succeeding Impotencie ſhall exceed your Power that was his Predeceſſour; I ſay, you will not thē giue over Telling one another his Power, that exceeds all others. You will then Tell] by your Waxing Old as doth a 
               Heb. 1. Pſal. 102. Iſai. 34.
               Garment, how True hee is, that gaue his Word you ſhould doe ſo. You will Pronounce His being ſtill the Same, by your being, when you ſhall bee ſo Old, ſo Diverſe: His Extolling, by your Falling downe: His Enduring, by your Periſhing: The Dilatation, the Explication, and Vnfolding of his Praiſe, by your being Folded vp,
               
(Heb. 1. 12) &amp; Rowled together. What ſhall I ſay, that you Will ſay? I know not how much you doe Now Tell. How then can I foretell, how much you will Thē 
               Tell vnto Gods Glory? Only this I know, That you will Then Tell, and More then you doe Now, A Word vnto One another; A Word of God, that Endureth for Ever. And the Elder you wax, the more Talkitiue you will bee: &amp; the more you decreaſe, the more will your Glorifying Speech increaſe. As reaſon is; your Knowledge and Experience of Gods Glory ever more and more Increaſing.
            
            And here the Oldest Men of all may go to Schoole, to the Oldeſt Times and Dayes, and other of Gods Creatures, much elder then themſelues: to Learne of them, how to behaue themſelues towards God, in their Olde Age, and when that their ſtrength faileth them. Not then to neglect, and reſigne to younger men, the Service of Gods Glory. Not then to doe that, which they ſay Old mē may doe by Authority: But what they ought to doe by the Authority of the Booke of Gods Glory. Which requireth of them to caſt away profane and olde Wiues Fables, and to Tell, as the Dayes doe, true 
               See pag. 25. of the good vſe of our Engliſh word [Tale]
               Tales of God Almighty; ſuch as may be vnto others inſteede of Commentaries and Expoſitions of Gods Great Goodneſſe. Lingua cùm verum loqui caeperit, id eſt, Virtutem, Maiestatem

               Lactantius. Whē our Tongue vndertaketh to tell Truth, that is, to be an Interpreter of the Power and Maieſty of ſo Singular a God, Then, &amp; neuer but then, doth it diſcharge his Naturall Functiō. You therefore that be Old, &amp; haue had for a long time Experience

of Gods Power and Goodneſſe, and haue heard longer then others, what One Day hath ſaid thereof vnto another: Be you Examples of Truth vnto others, of ſetting forth Gods prayſes, and of Interpreting his Glory: &amp; that ſo much the more, the weaker that you grow: That Gods Power may haue his Perfect Praiſe, by making you ſo Strong in Praiſing him by your Goodnes, when you are weake, and haue one legge already in the graue, yea and in your Sickneſſe, and your Death. Then thinke too of your Crowne &amp; your Reward, how neere you are vnto it: how neere vnto the goale of Glory, &amp; to the end of your race: and, that therefore yee ought not by any meanes to ſlacke your pace, but to haſten it: making it appeare vnto Gods Glory, that it hath beene no forced Motion in you, vnto Godlyneſſe &amp; Gloryfying Gods Name, but a Naturall; Swifter in the End, then it was in the Beginning.
            A fifth, and neceſſarily the laſte thing Enacted;  is the Laſte Day, and End of the world: when the Power of God, that Made the world, ſhall bee Demonſtrated as it were à Poſteriore: by the Diſſolution and Destruction of 
               Diſſolution of this Parliament.
               the world, by the laſte Day, the End of Time, &amp; Determination of all Termes and Termers. When the Hoſte of Heaven ſhall be Diſſolved: (Iſai. 34,) When Gods Alpha ſhall returne to his Omega, &amp; Dayes Temporall ſhall Cō
                  mend his Praiſe to Day Eternall. When his most wonderfull Power and Glory ſhall be ſeene in and by the Sonne of God himſelfe, Deſtroying the vngodly, and preſerving His, that is, the Godly, in the middeſt of that Vniverſall Conflagration, and receiving them to Glory: (prefigured

happily by the preſervation of Shadrach, Meſhach, and Abednego, in the middeſt of the Extraordinarily Hcated Burning Fiery Furnace, and afterwards promoting them, whileſt their Enemies were conſumed, by One like vnto the Sonne of God, Dan. 3.) When the Heaven, the Veſture of Gods Glory, ſhall be Folded vp, &amp; Changed for a New. When the Heavenly Scrole, or Book, out of which Gods glory is now taught vs, ſhall be rouled together (Iſai. 34.) and the whole Army of the Leaues therof ſhall be looſer then Sibyllas Leaues, or the Leaues of This Booke: yea, ſhall fall downe as the Leaues of a Trce, &amp; as a Falling Figge from the Figge tree, (Iſai. 34.) Laſtlie; when This Booke of the world ſhall be Cancelled &amp; Burnt, and Men ſhall go no more to Schoole (to It, the Law, or elſe the Goſpell) to learne ſuch Knowledge of Gods Glory, as now they haue: but ſhal Themſelues, not their Bookes, be Tranſlated, thoſe that haue beene Good Scholers Here, from Diſcourſing and Diſcurſiue Knowledge of Gods Glory, to Angel-like Intuitiue Knowledge, and Ever Bleſſed Beholding of Him and of his Glory, to whom we are ſo much Beholding: eſpecially for That Knowledge and Beholding of Him, and of his glory, That Gods Glory, by the Miraculous Speech of the Loweſt, moſt Indocible, and moſt Senſles Creatures.is Bleſſed for Ever. Amen.
            
            And now, Beloved in GODS beſt Beloved, if we ſhal but draw the curtaine, The very ſpeach of more Inferiour and Baſe Speachleſſe Creatures will come into the Reckoning of Recounting Gods Glory. As when God opened the mouth of Balaams Aſſe, (Num. 22.) and made a Dumbe Vnreaſonable Creature to ſpeake Reaſon: to Reproue therby the Madneſse of the Prophet (2. Pet. 2. 16.)

yea and of Vs all; who either ſpeake not at all, or elſe ſpeake ſo out of Reaſon, as though we had changed Differences with an Aſse: who ſpeake ſo much, and many yeeres together, and yet ſpeake ſo little according to Gods word, and of his praiſe. When as the Aſse ſpake nether often, nor yet much: and yet all he ſpake was according to That Word, &amp; to That praiſe; wherof Man cannot Speake too much, nor yet too often. And if we would ſpeake of Other Kind of Speach we might finde Another Aſse aſſumed to the Totall Summing vp of Gods prayſes: even that Chriſtopher, or Christ-Bearing Aſſe; that was Prophecied of, that Chriſt ſhould ride vpon him, &amp; was farther Dignified with His Riding on him.
            And ſo, leaving theſe, let vs proceede to things more Senſeleſſe. For (according to the ſaying of our Luke 19Saviour) If theſe ſhould hold their peace, the 
               Vid. Hab. 2. 11.
               Stones would Cry. Would Cry, and from their Low Eſtate Crie out Lowd, in the Commendation of the Power of God, that made them, and in the Proclaiming of His Christ vnto the World. He that is Able of Stones to raiſe vp Children vnto

            I will not here ſpeake of Stones Applauding Venerable Bede in his Preaching; or ſuch like: But wil ſpeake of Speech more warrantable.
            When Christ was Crucified, the Vaile of the Temple was Rent in twaine▪ from the top to the bottome: the Rocks alſo did Rent. Here are Rents of Gods Power, here Revenewes

of His Glory; proceeding out of Rēted Mouths, or, as it were, out of Cloven Tongues. Tongues and Mouths of Things Rented, that were moſt vnlikely ever to Rent of themſelues: the one for Fineneſſe and Softneſſe, the other becauſe of Strength and Hardneſſe. So the one ſending forth, out of His Rent, as it were a Fine &amp; Soft voice of Gods Glory, the other a Strōg and Hard voice: both of them Heard farre and neere, by One Dayes ſpreading the Report thereof vnto another; both of them fit matter for the Building of GODS Glory, even in the Strongeſt Wall-worke thereof, His Strength of Our Redemption. Of which, neither of them both is without ſignification.
            
            The Renting of the Vaile (to allow ſome ſpace for the caſting vp of the Audit of ſo Long and Large a Rent-Roule) is it not the voice as it were of a Cryer, Preparing the way of the Lord into Heaven, proclaiming the lifting vp of the Everlaſting Doores and Gates, that the 
               Pſal. 24.
               King of Glory may come in, &amp; pronoūcing the Opening of the way into the Holyest of

His Face, had Filthy Spittle, Boxes and Buffets to Diſfigure it. His Body, Bonds to Bruiſe it, in girthing it to the Piller, worſe then is the Pillerie: yea and it had Laſhes to make Gaſhes in it. His Hands and Feet, had Nayles, to Bruiſe them and to Pearce them. His Inward parts, Gall and Vineger, Deſpitefull words, Griefe and Anguiſh, yea and Death it ſelfe, to Diſſolue this Rocke, &amp; to Rent the Body of this Vaile aſunder from the Soule.

               Wings and Lookes, the Swift Fame of Gods Glory is beſt Seene to be lifted vp to Heavē, where the Head of that Fame reſideth: and out of whoſe Mouthes and Faces God hath ordained a perfect Body of his Praiſe, by ſo Perfectly and Superexcellently Fitting of One Bodie (Heb. 10. 5.)?
            So that it was no marveile, though Miraculous, that the Earth too, our Olde Mother, were great with child with GODS Praiſes, &amp;, like vnto Elizabeth (Luk. 1) had a Babe too within her that leaped in her wombe for ioy and wonderment, at the ſound of the voice of the Lord

of Glory being Crucified, and Riſen, and ſo ſent forth a voice of Exultation from the Loweſt, for the Exaltation of the Higheſt. Here She, for all her Heavineſſe and Immobility, could not but be moued to make her Submiſſiue and Subterrene Obeiſance at the Name of Ieſus, and to Omnipotencie. Stand ſtill Shee could not, but daūce ſhe muſt as it were a Quavering Pavin, &amp; ſend forth a Quaking Vid. Heb. 12 26.Shaking voice, of GODS Praiſes, for ſo high an Exaltation of any, yea and many of Her Bodies, and her Children: as, frō 
               Terreſtrial, to become Coeleſtiall. Yea She could not here chooſe but be Delivered of Babes out of her wombe, before her Ordinary Time. Babes that Dyed not, but being Dead did Liue againe, by this Abortion, or vntimely Birth. Babes Borne with GODS Prayſes in their mouthes, and wearing the Liveries of His Glory on their backs. Babes of Excellent Deliverie, in the Prayſing of a Now Rayſed Rayſing vp Deliverer. For The Graues, or Monuments (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) were opened, and Many Bodies of Saints which ſlept, Aroſe, And came out of the Graues, or Sepulchres, after His Reſurrection, and went into the Holy City, and Appeared vnto Many. Here (that as well The Wonders of the Deepe, as the Height of the Third Heavens, may conclamitate with S. Paule (Rom. 11. 33.) O the Depth &amp;c. and that we with all Saints may the better comprehend that Incomprehenſible Depth and Height, Epheſ. 3. 18. 19.) The Earth alſo hath Her Quire of Baſe and Treble voices, Conſorting with others, vnder Ground, and Her Sepulchres Church for the Service of GODS Glory. Here are Graue voices too: here Words of Gravitie. The Graues and Sepulchres,
               
the Moniments and Memorials of GODS Prayſes, open their Mouthes. And what comes out of them? Not Words of Men, but Men of Words, Men Words, Men inſteed of Words. Words as Subſtātiall as Bodies, as Weightie as Dead Bodies, and as Liuely as Twiſe Living Bodies.
            
            Now if Speech, or Words of Creatures, in their kind be ſo Subſtantiall, ſo Weightie, and ſo Liuely: in ſo much that the Speech of Men-Creatures is not onely called their Glory aboue other Creatures (as aboue ye heard) but is alſo called by the name of 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , their Reaſon, their very Forme, their Substantiall and Glorious difference from other Creatures: What then may wee thinke of the Chiefeſt Speech or Word of the Creatour himſelfe, after whoſe Image Man was created? How truely Subſtantiall, Conſubſtantiall with God, and of the very Nature of the Deitie, How Weightie and Powerfull, how Liuely muſt he needes be, and Life it ſelfe?
            And ſo, from ſpeaking of Speech, and Speech Extraordinarie and Miracalous, I deſcend to ſome wordes touching [A Word] here in my Text: and draw neerer and neerer to the laſt ſpoken of Word, giuing you ſtill warning by the way, of his approaching.
            
               One Day telleth a Word vnto another.] But a VVord. 
                T'is but a Verball Praedication of GODS Glory. Nay &amp; (if you remember the Proſopopoeia in the Manner of their Speech) t'is but as it were 
                  Tanquam verbum, tanquam ſcientiam &amp;c. ſaith S. Auſtin, as p. 41.a Verball Predicatiō, of GODS Glory. So farre is the Day frō any Reall Glorifying of GOD. Yea and ſo far are we of from giuing any Glory vnto GOD, ſaue in Words only.
            
               
               Where we ſee the Goodnes of GOD towardes vs his creatures, ſo farre excelling aboue all thankſgiuing and praiſe, as Deeds are ſtill better then Words; nay, as all his noble Acts ſurpaſſe our Quid retribuam Domino, our wordy more then worthy Retributions. Ipſe quā
               do nos glorificat, (ſaith S. Auſtin In Pſal. 39. &amp; ſee, p. 108. where Athanaſius is alleaged vpon Epheſ. 1. 6.) facit nos glorioſiores, facit nos honoratiores: quando eum glorificamus, nobis prodeſt, non illi. Quomodo enim eum glorificamus? glorioſum dicendo, non faciendo. When God Glorifieth vs, he maketh vs more Glorious, he maketh vs more honourable: But when we Glorifie him, it maketh nothing for him, but for our ſelues. For how doe we Glorifie him? Only by ſaying, that he is Glorious; by calling, but not by making of him ſo.
            O then, Beloved, if it bee but Wordes, they coſt vs nothing: why ſpare we them in glorifying the Lord, &amp; are no more ſparefull of them in diſhonouring of him, in profaning, yea and blaſpheming of his Holy Name? T'is but Words for Deeds. But Words. And were all our words ſo as they ſhould bee rectified and directed to GODS Glory, they would make but One Word in the whole volume thereof. Yet ſee, as if wee had ſtill liued in Cimmerian darkneſſe, where never any Day might haue informed vs: we are ſo vnthankfull vnto GOD, that ſcant &amp; ſcarce cā we afford him Words for Deeds: Words of Glory, for all the Glory given by his Word vnto his Creatures.
            And here thoſe Papiſts, who wil not ioyne with vs in ſerving of God, in praiſing and glorifying his holy Name; not ſo much, ſome of them, as in ſaying Amen vnto our Graces, (as the Relation of Religion at large

diſcourſeth) are very groſly reprehenſible. The Days however otherwiſe it differeth from the Night, yet gladly ioyneth with it in the Relation of GODS Glory; never ceaſing, ſo as it may, to play the Daily Orator in this behalfe. Then let the Papiſts liken themſelues vnto the Day: ſhall they, becauſe of the diſſentings betweene them and vs, therefore fall out with GOD too, and barre him of his Glory? What though wee were Hereticks, nay though we were beaſts; ought they not therefore to accord with vs in the recording of GODS Glory? For GOD ſendeth vs many times vnto the Dumbe Creatures, to ioyne with them herein, yea and to be enioyned a Leſſon by them herein. For this is ſuch a Generall dutie, ſo generally by all things in their kind to be obſerued, that it ought not for any cauſe, for any perſon, time, place, or other reſpect whatſoever to be deſerted. They muſt maintaine the Predicating of GODS Glory de omni, per ſe, &amp; quatenus ipſum; or elſe they will proue erroneous, if not hereticall Demonstrators of Gods Glory. To praiſe and Glorify GOD in Words (for in Workes they ſay they goe before vs) is the End too wherefore they were created: t'is their Glory too, their Beautie, &amp; Perfection. If they will forſake all theſe for our ſakes, they will doe ſomewhat for their owne.

            But One Word; in reſpect of All GODS Glory.
            But One Word; in reſpect of that Word, which laſte of all we ſhall ſpeake of.
            
               
               One Word, is but little in reſpect of all the Knowledge in the World. But much leſſe is this Word of Gods Glory, (ſo as by the Dayes it is declared) and this Motto much leſſe then one atome to the whole motey world of Democritus; if it be cōpared to the Infinite Worlds of Glory belonging to the Creatour of this World. So that, though many be the words which the Dayes vtter touching Gods Glory, their words of this matter ſtill iſhuing and guſhing forth like water out of a never dryed fountaine: (according to that which hath beene delivered in the expounding of the word 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                here in my Text) yet are they all but One Word, in reſpect of the whole Subiect of their Speech.
            O then, Beloued, if wee ſhould ſpend all our time in ſpeaking of, and to GODS Glory: yet how little world Our words be in reſpect of that immenſe Matter, of &amp; to the which we ſhould ſtill ſpeake! For Our Dayes are but a ſpanne long. They are gon like a ſhadow, and paſſe away like ſmoake, Pſa. 102. The Dayes will laſt, whē all Our Dayes are paſt: they will line, when we are dead and gone.
            And why then, Good GOD, haſt thou made Man, that he of all others, he rather then the Day, ſhould be the Speaker in the Parliament of thy Praiſes? Hee in Words to Glorifie thy Name, not onely for himſelfe, but for all other Creatures too? tanquam nomine aliarum creaturarum omnium, pro tot tantiſ

               ſpeaketh (and Epictetus 
               Arrian E. pictet. lib. 1. cap. 17.hath the like) in the name as it were of all other Creatures. What? and of the Day too, which it ſelfe, after his Manner, ſpeaketh

ſo much in thy praiſe? And muſt it not needs then be no more then One word of thy Praiſe and Glory, &amp; of our Thankeſgiving vnto thee for all thy Benefits, which any of vs all can vtter all our life long, in reſpect of thy Glorious Name, how it excelleth aboue all Thankeſgiving and Praiſe? Nehem. 9. 5.
            
            
               One Day telleth a Word vnto another. A Word, and allwaies of GODS Glory. The Subiect every Day, and to every Day, the ſame continually. Yet never is any Day wearie of this every Dayes Subiect; ſo ſhewing how the Glory of God is no more tedious for a continuall Subiect in this world, then it will be for an everlaſting Obiect in the world to come.
            Then iudge you, Beloued, whether they bee not worthy of Reprehenſion; who thinke it too much, to haue the Gloria Patri &amp;c. ſo much repeated, and would allow it but one place for many: as my ſelfe haue ſeen in too many places of this Land; where, neglecting the Order preſcribed by the Church &amp; by our Service Booke, of concluding every Pſalme with the Gloria Patri, &amp;c. they, and they too ſome of them who otherwiſe would ſeeme to be formall enough, make haſt to skipp over the often mention of that Glory, for which they were created, and vnto which they owe their chiefeſt ſervice.
            They that thus find fault with the ſo oftē together inculcating of Gods Glory, why finde they not the like fault with the Seraphims? Who in the ſixth of Iſay, ver. 2. 3. (burning with the loue of Gods Glory otherwiſe thē theſe fault-finders doe) One cryed vnto another, &amp; ſaid,

Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord of hoſtes: the whole world is full of his Glory. Why correct they not our Saviours Eli, Eli, vpō the croſſe? Or his praying the Third time, ſaying the Same Words? Mat. 26. 44. Why blame they not the Prophet David, for that he would haue all thoſe that loue the ſalvation of the Lord, to lay alway, the Lord bee praiſed? Pſal. 40. 19. And for that ſame in one ſelfeſame Pſalme Foure times reiterated, (Pſal. 107.) O that men would therfore praiſe the Lord for his goodneſse, &amp; declare the wonders that he doth for the childrē of men? And that, as often in the ſame Pſalme, So whē they cryed vnto the Lord in their trouble, he delivered thē out of their diſtreſs? And that Thrice in one Pſalme (Pſal. 115.) He is their helper and defender? And that, (Pſal. 116.) I will call vpon the name of the Lord? And that, (Pſ. 118) In the name of the Lord will I destroy them? As alſo, for that ſo often together repeated (Pſalm. 118. and, 136.) His mercy endureth for ever? Laſtly, why blame they not the Prophet David, for here avouching, that One Day ſtill telleth (the Glory of God) vnto another? Nay, and the Dayes themſelues too, for ſo doing? For telling a word, But a word, and But one word of Gods Glory? Alwaies of GODS Glory, and yet alwaies telling that, &amp; beſides that doing nothing. For Every Day vnto another vttereth the Same. The Same. what's that ſame? The Glory of God.
            
            Nor every Day only inſiſteth only on this golden Matter, but every Houre of the Day too, yea and every Moment of an Houre (according alſo to that Explication given in my firſt Sermō) ſtill dwelleth on this one Glorious Subiect, vnceſſantly vrging the never ceaſing

Glory of the Higheſt.
            Some man will ſay; he diſliketh not the often repetition of the Gloria Patri, &amp;c: quatenus, for, or in that it is the often mention of Gods Glory. But, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , Ariſt. Phyſic. lib. 3. contex. 51
               
               He may not ſo be gone. For, quatenus, even in and for that it is the often mentioning of Gods Glory, therefore he ought not at all to diſlike it. T'is (as you haue heard) the End wherevnto man is ordeined, to ſhew forth GODS Glory both in word and deed: t'is all his Vertue and Perfection. He therefore that ſhall miſlike the continuall doing thereof ether way, doth as if he ſhould picke a quarrell with a Roſe, becauſe it never ſmelleth but 
               
                  As Aul. Gellius (lib. 19 cap. 2,) citeth out of Ariſtotle.
               ſweet: or with himſelfe, for being alwaies Reaſonable; and happily that maketh him in this thing ſo vnreaſonable. for t'is a ſhame, Beloved, that ſuch Profeſſours of the Service of GOD, as we would ſeeme to be, ſhould yet come ſhort of giving that Glory vnto GOD, which even the whole world ſticketh not to doe: part-Chriſtians, (as they are reckoned) Turkes, and Infidels, and all. Not any Tract in Arabian, which is not begun with the name of God, and of the Mercifull God, prefixed to it. In the End of the Lords Prayer, though the Glory of GOD be there immediatly before mentioned, (as yee knowe in the Concluſiō) yet there is annexed alſo to this ſenſe: Honour and Praiſe and Glory, and Vertue and Power &amp; Iuſtice to God the only King everlaſting, for evermore. In the beginning even of the Alcoran it ſelfe are put thoſe three letters, Eliph, Lem, &amp; Mim: which they call the Seale of the Booke, and by which (as they ſay) are

                meant the Name, the Maiestie, and high Commaunde of God. It being a thing even by the Law of Nature written in mens hearts, and vnto which the whole world is driven, by words to magnifie GODS name, &amp; by a verball predication to declare his Glory. And doth it not then concerne vs more neere, now that the Glory of God is every Day more and more made manifeſt, to Seale vp every Pſalme, yea (if it were poſſible) every word, every worke, every thought, every imagination of ours, with ſome ſpecification, or elſe ſome intimation or other of that Great Glory?
            
            T'was not the often repetition, Beloved, that made the Firſt diſlikers of the Gloria Patri, &amp;c: not to favour it. No. the Arrians ſtucke at it, becauſe they ſtucke at Chriſts Divinity. So did the Sabellians, becauſe they cōfoūded the Three Perſons. Wherfore the Church then wiſely brought in the Gloria Patri, &amp;c: as to try who were ſuch Heretikes, ſo eſpecially for the mainetaining of Gods Glory againſt them. Yea but the Cauſe why it was ſo ordained is now ceaſed. And how is that true? Arrianiſme as yet remaining among the Turks, according to the firſt ſowing therof among them by Sergius Monachus, who was an Arrian. Or ſay that this were not ſo: yet the Cauſe of retaining it, being ſo ordained, is not none at all. We know not all the Divels craft: his purpoſe may be againe to induce, and then to maintaine old hereſies. As at this day we ſee Arrianiſme about to creepe into the Chriſtiā world againe, and now and then to peepe vp his head. And t'is not good for vs to bee vnprovided of our former

furniture; and becauſe we haue no warre, to fling away our weapons.
            Againe; another reaſon, of not relinquiſhing or diſvſing this moſt excellent Epiphoneme; is, that which now we haue in hand: even the oftner repetition and more frequent commemoration of the Glory of God, the Father the Sonne and the Holy Gboſt; A reaſon ſufficient, if it had beene even of the firſt ordeining of it.
            And ſo drawing neerer to my Text, &amp; to you too, Beloued: Beloued, I beſeech you, that you would bee very frequent in giuing Glory vnto God by your words and communication; and to bee ſo farre from thinking it tedious and tireſome vnto you, to bee alwaies cōverſant in this one Subiect: as that you would eſteeme it the chiefe Glory of your Speech, to haue it ſeaſoned 
               Col. 4. 6.with the often mention of Gods Glory: thinking your lippes ſo much the happier, the oftner his Praiſe, the praiſe of his Glory, paſſeth through them: Hor. de Art. Poetic.
               Haec placuit ſemel, haec decies repetita placebit.
            
            For how elſe may you be thought loath to bee alwaies converſant in ſetting forth Gods Glory by your good Converſation! (to which alſo wee are all bounden, and of which wee ſpake before) to whom it ſhall be ſo tedious to be tyed, but in words only, to ſo Glorious a Subiect; About which we ſhould bee alwaies turning and returning, tanquam rota

            The Word of GOD is either De hoc duplici verbo, vid. Damaſcen. de Ortb. fid. lib. 2. cap. 21. &amp; alios.
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , or 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               : Mentall, or Enuntiatiue. This word of God, is The revealed will of God 
               As Damaſcen defineth the word of God. Each related by the Dayes.
               :That the Inmoſt word, the Qui dicit Deum mentem, dieit eius prudentiam. Theophil. Antioch. lib. 1. ad Autolyc. c. 1.

               1 For the firſt, it is manifeſt: firſt, out of that Pſ. 119. Lamed. v. 1. O Lord, thy Word endureth for ever in heaven. Then; Revelatio fit non ſolùm per doctrinam, ſedetiam per opera Vid P. Lomb. ſup. Rom. 1.
               : The wil of God is revealed not only by Doctrine, but by the workes of God too. According to that in the 19th, and 20th
                Verſes of the firſt to the Romanes: And that in the 17th and 18th
                Verſes of the tenth to the Romanes; where the Apoſtle ſaith, Hearing is by the Word of God. But I demand, haue they not heard? No doubt their ſound went out through all the Earth, &amp; their words into the endes of the World; alleaging the 4th
                Verſe of this Pſalme.
            
            Where wee may note, how the Apoſtle proueth The Hearing of the Word of God, by The Hearing of their words: as if their Words were the Word of God. Their words, that is, The Dayes Words too, among the reſt: which

neceſſarily, and moſt naturally, muſt be meant by that place in this Pſalme.
            
               How they had any Word of God, which they might be ſaid to heare, who happily were not within hearing of the Prophets or Apoſtles, S. Chryſoſtome teacheth vs: as in the already alleaged places out of him in my ſecond Sermō, ſo alſo at large on the firſt chapter to the Romanes; where hee ſaith, 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ; &amp;c: Did God ſend downe a voice from heaven vnto them? No. (ſaith he) But that which might prevaile more with them, then ſuch a voice, that did he; hee ſet forth his Creatures and diſplaied them openly to the view of all; that they by their ſight vnderstanding the ſightlineſſe of things viſible, might ſo mount vp to the inviſible God. And againe, in that which next ſhall bee alleaged out of S. Chryſoſtome. As alſo Athanaſius (in the Fragments of him) ſaith: 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . And afterwards, 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                
               Sc.

                  .
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . Haue thoſe workes &amp; creatures of God, which are mute &amp; dumb, yet no voice or ſpeech at all? Yes, (ſaith he) their admirable feature is a kind of talking of theirs, and their beautie and Eutaxie, or goodly Order, is as it were a ſound or voice of theirs.
            Hence ariſe two Obſervations. One touching our  ſelues, the other concerning the Heathen. For our ſelues: by this Word of God reported by the Dayes, wee may note how negligent wee are, or elſe how ignorant of the Whole Word, the whole Revealed word of God (The things revealed belonging to vs, and to our children

for ever. Deut. 29. 29.) for, as if there were no Word of God, but only writtē in paper: ſo paſſe we over lightly Opera Dei nō intuentur, &amp; opera manum eius non conſiderant. Iſai. 5. 12.
               what ever of Gods word is written, imprinted, ſtamped, and engraven in his workes. Whereas this alſo ought highly to be eſteemed and regarded by vs. Eſpecially, whereas the Booke of the Scripture is the renewing

               , repairing, and reſtoring of the Booke of the World; like vnto the renewing of the two Tables of the Testimony, (Exod. 34) after that the firſt were broken. And t'is no good part in a Scholer, as ſoone as he hath a new Booke, ſtraight waies to fling away the Old: eſpecially hee hauing not yet throughly learned the old. For GOD hath, indeed, ſet the World in their hart, yet cannot man findout the works that GOD hath wrought frō the beginning even to the end. Which one S. Frauncis Bacon, in his booke of the Advancemēt▪ of Learning, pag. 4. 6.of late, though no Divine, yet divinely hath interpreted of the Supreame and Summary law of Nature. And when wee haue done all that we can to finde out Gods Glory by his Workes: we may ſtill ſay with Iob 
               Iob. 26. 14.; Lo, theſe are part of his waies: but how little a portion heare we of him? And, as t'is in Eccleſiaſticus, (cap. 43. v. 30, 31, 32) There are hid yet greater things then theſe be, and we haue ſeene but a few of his workes.
            
            
                The other Obſervation concerneth the Heathen; How inexcuſable this Word of God reported by the Dayes maketh them. An Obſervation drawne by S. Chryſostome out of my Text, and the Texts about it: as appeareth by his expoſition on the twentith verſe of the firſt to the Romanes: where, hauing alleaged the firſt part of the firſt verſe of this Pſalme, he ſaith: 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               
               
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ; &amp;c. What will the Heathen ſay at that Day? can they ſay, O God, we knewe thee not? wee heard not of thee? No did? (ſaith he) never heard yee the Heavens ſpeaking vnto you by their ſightlineſſe, and the excellently compoſed harmonie of all things ſoūding ſhriller then any trumpet? never ſaw you the manner of the Day and of the Night, how ſtill they continue on their courſe? &amp;c.

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ; What ſaith he to the Heathen? &amp;c. to the Heathen. For, becauſe t'is the Worde of God too, which One Day reporteth vnto another, and yet for all that they haue not beleeued The Dayes Report: therefore are they altogether without excuſe, for not Beleeuing when they heard the word of God.
            
            O but if wee had heard That Word of God which you haue heard, the Revealed Written word of God, then we might haue beleeued. O, no, it is not likely: GOD at all times and in all ages providing for all men the fitteſt meanes▪ in reſpect of themſelues &amp; of their times, to bring them vnto GOD becauſe he would haue all men ſaued.

Which whole Scripture they haue had long ere this, by One Dayes Report vnto another, promulgated and proclaimed vnto them. And ſo haue they had Another word to teach thē too; another Word of God; another Word which One Day telleth to another. Nor only haue they had the Doctrine of Moſes and the Prophets to inſtruct them, but of the Apoſtles too: nor of thoſe only, but of him that taught them too, even of Chriſt himſelfe: and therefore as yet of Another word of God too; another Word which One Day telleth to another. Another? Yea, and anothergates Word of God is this, of which wee are now to ſpeake in the next place: being now as it were carried backe againe into the maine Sea of GODS Glory; The Dayes here in my Text ſeeming to ſmile out a certaine willingneſſe, to haue the whole courſe of their Diſcourſe there determined: like as when

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                
               Are types and models of a Trinity▪ of God, and of his Word, &amp; of his Wiſedome. So that this Word was that Day firſt declared, in which Gods Wiſedome firſt declared it ſelfe vnto the world, by making the firſt Day, &amp; the works thereof, by ſuch a

by prophecies, was this Word ſtill forſhewed, yea and ſhewed forth vnto the world?
            
               So that it was no marveile, if, by the Dayes ſo &amp; ſo reporting this Word vnto the world, the very heathen men themſelues had ſuch knowledge of this heavenly word, as they had. For, Fuerunt &amp; Prophetae non ipſius, in quibus etiam aliqua inveniuntur, quae de Christo audita ceeinerunt: ſicut etiam de Sibylla dicitur, &amp;c. ſaith S. Austin, in his begunne Expoſition on the Epiſtle to the Romanes. There were certaine Prophets, and yet none of Gods Prophets nether, in whom are ſome things found concerning Christ: which after they had heard, they alſo ſang of &amp; reported: among whom was Sibylla. Which (ſaith S. Auſtin)▪ I ſhould not eaſily haue beleeved, but for that of a certaine famous Poët among the Latins, (meaning 
               Eclog. 4.Virgil) Vltima Cumaet venit tā carminis aetas, &amp;c. And S. Auſtin hath afterwardes in the ſame place, how that th' Apoſtle knew, ea in libris gentium inveniri teſtimonia veritatis, that there were ſuch teſtimonies of the Truth found in the books of the Gētiles. And again, alittle after: In literis Gentiū ſuperſtitioſae idololatriae pleniſsimis aliquid quod ad Chriſtū pertinet invenitur. There is ſomething found cōcerning Chriſt, thē in the moſt ſuperſtitious &amp; Idolatrous books of the Gentils. Norknew the Gētiles ſomething only concerning Chriſt. For they had knowledge alſo of this Word, even as he was the Word; as appeareth by that of Serapis vnto Thulis king of Aegypt:
            
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

Commemo ravi legiſſe me quoſdam libros, in iſtis autem omnibus modis inſinuari Deum &amp; eius verbum.affirmeth, that he had read this beginning of S. Iohns Goſpell in the bookes of ſome of the Platonists. And in his tēth booke de civitate dei, cap. 29. 
               Iuxta finem.he ſaith, That a certaine Platonist (as Simplictanus, a reverend old man, and which was afterwards Biſhop of Myllane, was wont to tell him) ſaid, That that beginning of S. Iohns Goſpell was worthy to be writtē in Aureis literis conſcribendum, &amp; per omnes Eccleſias, &amp;c.Golden Letters, and to be ſet vp and publiſhed in everie Church and Congregation, and that in the moſt eminent and conſpicuous places.
            Out of all which wee gather ſtill more and more, how inexcuſable the Infidels and vnbeleevers are, for not Beleeving this word of God, yea and for not Beleeving in him, of whom by every Dayes Report they had heard ſo much. And ſo much of the firſt thing here obſerved, touching this moſt honorable &amp; moſt pretious VVord of God.
            
            
               Gods Glory by the word Chriſt Ieſus Beſt of all Reported. 
               2 The other, and laſt thing is; That the Dayes by recoū
               ting this word, doe most of all recount Gods Glory.
            The Reaſon hereof is plaine. For God ſpeaking diverſe and ſundry waies vnto vs, that we may ſee him; and there being Three miroirs, in which God ſheweth him

ſelfe and his Glory vnto vs to be knowne: to wit, his word by his works, his word by the Scriptures, &amp; his word Chriſt Ieſus: by this last word only is God beſt known, &amp; ſhineth perfectly vnto vs: In as much as t'is by him too, that God is by thoſe other two waies, or anie way whatſoever, revealed vnto Whereof ſee Irenaeus, lib. 4. cap. 14.vs. And in as much as he is the Beſt word of all; as S.

               Gods Glory, by the Day, or, Time of our Redemption. Among the which, the chiefeſt, &amp; redoūding moſt to GODS Glory, is our Redemptiō, both promiſed, &amp; performed.

Out of whoſe Nativity, but much more out of the effuſion of his Bloud, as of the Beſt wine Reſerved to the laſt, and the infuſion thereof into our wounds; out of the aſperſion and inſperſion thereof, and out of the vertue of his moſt Glorious Reſurrection, doe the Sparkles of Gods Glory ariſe and mount vp into the Higheſt.
            
            Hereof; and how Sweete, how Gracefull, and how Glorious, the Speech is, the Hearing, the Report hereof: hath, in this poore ſpeech of mine, already beene reported to your hearing.
            In Reſpect of all which, yea All Gods Benefites towards vs, Chriſt is moſt worthily called [Omer] a word.] A word in Deed: or, a Doing word. A word] of Greateſt Power, to Doe Such things. A word] of moſt Faithfulneſſe]

            The Poet Claudian (de laude Christi) ſpeaking of the comming of Chriſt, maketh this to be the End thereof:
            
               Vt poſsis monstrare Deum, ne lubricus error,
               Et decepta diu varij ſolertia Mundi,
               Pectora tam multis ſinerent mortalia ſeclis
            
            Autorem neſcire ſuum. That men might rightly know God their maker. Which knowledge of GOD by Chriſt Ieſus, we that are indeede Chriſtians know to be as much worth, as Felicity it ſelfe; according to that Ioh. 17. 3. This is life eternall, to know thee the only true God, and him whom thou haſt ſent Ieſus Chriſt.]: To know thee by Ieſus Chriſt. In whom, whatſoever the Father hath, he would haue heaped and hoarded vp, that ſo he might both communicate himſelfe wholy vnto vs, and might glorifie his name. Hence ſaith 
               Ioh. 10. 30.
               Chriſt, I and my Father are one. And, 
               Ioh. 14 9.He that ſeeth me ſeeth my Father. And, 
               Ioh. 14. 6.No man commeth to the Father, but by me. And, 
               Mat 11. 27▪
               No man knoweth the Father but the Sonne, and he to whome the Sonne will reveale him. And, 
               Ioh. 14 6.I am the

Way. And, 
               Ioh. 10. 9▪
               I am the Doore. And, 
               Ioh. 8. 12. &amp; 9. 5. &amp; 12. 35. &amp; Ioh. 1. 4, 5.I am the Light. And, Ioh. 1. 9. He was the true Light, which lighteth every man that commeth into the World. For t'is by him that the luſtre of his Fathers Glory beſt of all bebeameth the whole world. Hence the Apoſtle (2. Cor. 4. 6.) placeth and repoſeth the Light or Illumination of the knowledge of the Glory of God, in the face of Ieſus Chriſt: when he ſaith, God hath ſhined in our hearts, to giue the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Ieſus Chriſt. In the Face of Ieſus Chriſt. For he is the liuely Image of his Father. The Image of the inviſible God. Col. 1. 15. and 2. Cor. 4. 4. The Brightneſse of his Fathers Glory, and the very Image of his Subſtance. Heb. 1. 3. And, as t'is in the 7th of Wiſdome, verſe 25, 26. He is a pure influence that floweth from the Glory of the Almightie: the Brightneſse of the everlaſting Light, The vndefiled Mirrour of the Maiestie of God, and the Image of his Goodneſſe.
            We ſpake before In the third Sermon.of other Images and Reſemblances of Gods Glory. All which come infinitely farre ſhort of this Image. For Man himſelfe herevnto compared is not ſo much the Image of God ſimply, as hee is ſaid to be made rather after the Image of God. Indeede 1. Cor. 11. 7. Man is there called, The Image and Glory of God. But elſewhere he is ſaid to be made after the Image of God. Why, The Image? And yet, why After the Image? The Image: becauſe he is indeede like vnto GOD. Againe, After the Image: becauſe of the vnlikeneſſe or vnperfectneſſe of this likeneſſe: in that he doth not perfectly reſemble GOD, as Chriſt repreſenteth his Father.
