            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

THE RIGHT
HONOURABLE

honoured Lord;
EDWARD,
LORD DENNY,
Baron of WALTHAM,
Earle of Norwich.
            
               Right Honourable,
            
            
               AS one that hath no
power to stand out against
the importunity
of him, whose least motion
is justly wont to passe with me,



for a command, I have here
sent your Lo: the copie of my
Sermon, lately preacht at the
Court; which partly the distance,
and partly the inconvenience
of the place, and season
would not suffer you to heare;
that now your eare may be supplyed
by your eye; though not
without some disadvantage on
my part: Let it lie by you, as a
private and faithfull Monitor
instead of
            
               Your Lops. truly and sincerely
devoted in all
observance,
JOS. EXON.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            THE
CHARACTER
OF MAN.
            
               PSAL. 144. 3.
               
                  Lord what is man that thou takest
knowledge of him; or
the sonne of man that thou makest
account of him?
                  Man is like unto vanity, &amp;c.
               
            
            
               MY Text, and so my
Sermon too, is the
just character of
man; A common,
and stale theme, you will say;
but a needfull one: we are all
apt to misknow or to forget



what we are; No blacks, nor
soule-bells, nor deaths heads
on our rings, nor funerall sermons,
nor tombes, nor Epitaphes
can fixe our hearts enough
upon our fraile, and
miserable condition; And if
any man have condescended
to see his face in the true looking
glasse of his wretched
frailty, so soon as his back is
turned hee forgets his shape
straight; Especially at a Court
where outward glory would
seem to shoulder out the
thoughts of poore despicable
mortality; Give mee leave
therefore, (Honourable and
beloved) to ring my owne
knell in your eares this day,
and to call home your eyes a
little, and to shew you that



which I feare you too seldome
see, your selves. Lent
and funeralls are wont still to
go both in one Livery: There
is no book so well worthy
reading as this living one;
Even now David spake as a
King of men, Of people subdued
under him; now hee
speakes as an humble vassall
to God: Lord what is man that
thou takest knowledge of him?
            
            In one breath is both soveraignty
and subjection; An
absolute soveraignty over his
people; My people are subdued
under me; An humble subjection
to the God of Kings;
Lord, what is man? Yea, in the
very same word wherein is
the profession of that soveraignty,
there is an acknowledgement



of subjection; Thou
hast subdued my people; In that
he had people, he was a King;
that they might be his people,
a subjugation was requisite;
and that subjugation was
Gods, and not his own; Thou
hast subdued; Lo David had not
subdued his people, if God
had not subdued them for
him; Hee was a great King,
but they were a stiffe people;
The God that made them
swayed them to a due subjection;
The great Conquerors
of worlds, could not conquer
hearts, if hee that molded
hearts did not temper them:
By me Kings raigne saith the
Eternall wisdome; and he that
had courage enough to encoūter
a Beare, a Lion, Goliah,


               
yet can say: Thou hast subdued
my people.
            
            Contrarily, in that lowliest
subjection of himselfe,
there is an acknowledgement
of greatnesse; though he abaseth
himselfe with a What is
man, yet withall, he addes, thou
takest knowledge of him, thou makest
account of him; And this
knowledge, this account of
God, doth more exalt man,
then his own vanity can depresse
him.
            My Text then, yee see, is
Davids rapture, expressed in
an extaticall question of sudden
wonder; a wonder at
God, and at man; Mans vilenesse:
What is man? Gods
mercy and favour, in his
knowledge, in his estimation



of man: Lo, there are but
two lessons that we need to
take out here, in the world,
God, and man; and here they
are both: Man in the notion
of his wretchednesse; God, in
the notion of his bounty:
Let us (if you please) take a
short view of both, and in
the one see cause of our humiliation,
of our joy and
thankfulnesse in the other, &amp;
if in the former, there be a sad
Lent of mortification, there is
in the latter, a chearfull Easter
of our raising and exaltation.
            Many a one besides David,
wonders at himselfe, one
wonders at his own honor,
and though hee will not say
so, yet thinkes What a great
man am I? Is not this great



Babel which I have built?
This is Nebuchadnezars wonder:
Another wonders at his
person, and findes either a
good face, or a faire eye, or an
exquisite hand, or a well
shap't leg, or some gay fleece
to admire in himselfe: This
was Absalous wonder: Another
wonders at his wit, and
learning: How came I by all
this? Turba haec. This vulgar
that knowes not the law,
is accursed. This was the Pharisees
wonder. Another wonders
at his wealth, Soule, take
thine ease, as the Epicure in
the Gospell. Davids wonder
is as much above, as against
all these; hee wonders at his
vilenesse: Like as the chosen
vessell would boast of nothing,



but his infirmities: Lord
what is man?
            
            How well this hangs together?
No sooner had hee
said, Thou hast subdued my people
under me, then he adds, Lord
what is man?
            
            Some vaine heart would
have beene lifted up with a
conceit of his own eminence;
Who I? I am not as other
men; I have people under me;
and people of my owne;
and people subdued to mee;
This is to bee more then a
man; I know who hath said,
I said ye are Gods. Besides Alexander
the great, how many of
the Roman Cesars have been
transported with this self-admiration,
and have challenged
Temples, Altars, Sacrifices.



How have they shared the
moneths of the yeare among
them; April must be Neronius,
May Claudius, Iune Germanicus,
September Antoninus,
Domitian will have October,
November is for Tiberius, by
the same token, that when it
was tendered to him, he askt
the Senat wittily (as Xiphiline
reports it) what they would
doe when they should have
more then twelve Cesars; But
if there were not moneths
enow for them, in the yeare;
there were starres enow in the
Skie, there was elbow-room
enough in their imaginary
heaven for their deification.
What tell I you of these▪ a sory
Clearchus of Pontus, as
Suidas tells us, would be



worshipped, and have his
son called Lightning; Menecrates
the Physitian (though
not worthy to bee Esculapius
his Apothecaries boy) yet
would be Iupiter: Empedocles
the Philosopher, if it had not
been for his shoo would have
gone for Immortall. Sejanus
will be sacrificing to himself.
I could tyre you with these
prodigies of pride. I could
tell you of a Xerxes that will
be correcting the Hellespont,
and writing letters of threat
to the mountain Athos: of
one of his proud Sultan successors
Sapores that writ himselfe
Brother to the Sun, and
Moone: of his great neighbour
of China that styles
himself Heire apparent to the



living Sun: and the wise
Cham of Tartary, Son of the
highest God; Caligula would

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                as Dio,
counter-thunder to God;
and will bee no lesse then Iupiter
Latialis; And the Scythian
Roylus can say; It is easie for
him to destroy all that the
Sun lookes upon; Lord God!
how can the vaine pride of
man befoole him, and carry
him away to ridiculous affectations?
The man after Gods
own heart is in another vain;
when he lookes downward,
he sees the people crouching
under him, and confesses his
own just predominancy, but
when hee lookes either upward
to God, or inward to
himselfe, he sayes, Lord what



is man? It should not be, it is
not in the power of earthly
greatnesse to raise the regenerate
heart above it selfe, or to
make it forget the true groūds
of his own humiliation. Avolet,
quantum volet palea, as he
said: Let the light chaffe bee
hoised into the ayre, with every
winde (as Psal. 1.) the
solid grain lyes close, and falls
so much the lower, by how
much it is more weighty. It
is but the smoke that mounts
up in the furnace, it is but the
drosse that swells up in the
lump, the pure metall sinkes
to the bottome, if there be any
part of the crucible lower
then other, there you shall
finde it. The proud mountaines
shelve off the rain, and



are barren; the humble vallies
soak it up, and are fruitfull.
Set this pattern before
you ye great ones whom God
hath raised to the height of
worldly honor: Oh be ye as
humble as ye are great: the
more high you are in others
eyes, be so much more lowly
in your owne, as knowing
that hee was no lesse then a
King that said, Lord what is
man?
            
            The time was when David
made this wonder upon
another occasion. Psal. 8. 3, 4.
When I see the heavens, the moon
and the stars that thou hast ordained,
Lord what is man? When
looking over that great night-piece,
and turning over the
vast volume of the world (as



               Gerson termes it) hee saw in
that large folio, amongst
those huge capitall letters,
what a little insēsible daghespoint
man is, he breaks forth
into an amazed exclamation
Lord what is man? Indeed,
how could he doe other? To
compare such a mite, a mote,
a nothing with that goodly
and glorious vault of heaven,
and with those worlds of
light, so much bigger then so
many globes of earth, hanging,
and moving regularly in
that bright and spacious contignation
of the firmament, it
must needs astonish humane
reason, and make it ashamed
of its own poorenesse: Certainly,
if there could bee any
man that when hee knowes



the frame of the world could
wonder at any thing in himselfe,
save his owne nothingnesse,
I should as much wonder
at him, as at the world it
selfe.
            There David wondred to
cōpare man with the world;
here he wonders too to compare
man, with a world of
men, and to see that God had
done so much for him above
others in his advancement,
deliverances, victories. But
if any man had rather to take
this Psalme as a sacred Rhapsody,
gathered out of the 18.
and 8. and 39. Psalmes; and
this sentence as universall; I
oppose not; Let this wonder
be generall, not so much of
David, a man selected, as of



               David, a man. These two are
well joyned, Lord, What? For
however man when hee is
considered in himselfe, or
compared with his fellow-creatures,
may be something;
yet when he comes into mention
with his maker, he is lesse
then nothing. Match him
with the beast of the field, yea
of the desert; even there, however,
as Chrysostom, every beast
hath some one ill quality, but
man hath all; yet, in regard of
rule, what a jolly Lord he is;
here is omnia subjecisti, thou
hast put all things in subjection
to him; Not the fiercest
Lyon, not the hugest Elephant,
or the wildest Tyger,
but, either by force, or wile
man becomes his master; and



though they have left that originall
awe, which they bare
to him so soon as ever he forsook
his loyalty to his King;
yet still they doe, (not without
regret) acknowledge the
impressions of Majesty in
that upright face of his; Wherfore
are they but for man?
Some for his labor as the oxe;
some for his service as the
horse: some for his pleasure
as the dog, or the ape: some
for his exercise, as the beasts
of the forest, all for man: But
when we look up at his infinite
Creator, Lord what is man?
O God, thou art an intelligible
sphere, whose center is every
where, whose circumference
is no where but in thy
selfe: Man is a mere center



without a circumference.
Thou, O God, in una essentia
omnia praehabes, in one essence
forecomprisest all things, as
Aquinas out of Dionysiw; man,
in a poore imperfect composition
holds nothing. Thou
art light, hast light, dwellest in
light inaccessible; Man of
himselfe is as darke as earth,
yea as hell. Thou art God alsufficient,
the very heathen
could say, (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               );
It is for none but God to
want nothing: Man wants
all but evill; Shortly, thou art
all holinesse, power, justice,
wisdome, mercy, truth, perfection:
Man is nothing but
defect, error, ignorance, injustice,
impotence, corruption;
Lord then, what is man to



thee but a fit subject for thy
wrath, yet let it bee rather a
meet object of thy commiseration;
Behold we are vile,
thou art glorious; let us adore
thine infinitenesse, doe thou
pitty our wretchednesse. Lord
what is man?
            
            Leave wee comparisons;
Let us take man as he is himselfe;
It is a rule of our olde
country man of Hales, the acute
master of Bonaventure,
that a man should bee rigidus
sibi, pius aliis, rigorous to himselfe,
kinde to others: Surely,
as Nazianzen observes, in one
kinde, that nothing is more
pleasing to talk of then other
mens businesses, so, there is
nothing more easie, then for a
man to be wittily bitter in invectives



against his own condition;
who hath not braine,
and gall enough to be a Timon,
depreciari carnem hanc (as
Tertullian speakes,) to disparage
humanity; and like an angry
Lion to beat himselfe to
blood with his owne sterne;
Neither is it more rife for
dogs to bark at men, then
men at themselves. Alas, to
what purpose is this currish
clamour? Wee are miserable
enough though wee would
flatter our selves; To whose
insultation can we be thus exposed
but to our owne? I
come not hither to sponge
you with this vineger, &amp; gall,
but give mee leave a little,
though not to aggravate, yet
to deplore our wretchednes;



There can bee no ill blood in
this: Amaritudo sermonum medicina
animarū, this bitternesse
is medicinall, saith S. Ambrose;
I doe not feare wee shall live
so long as to know our selves
too well. Lord then what is
man? What in his being?
What in his depravation?
How miserable in both?
            What should I fetch the
poore wretched infant out of
the blinde cavernes of nature,
to shame us with our
conceptions, and to make us
blush at the substance, nourishment,
posture of that
which shall be a man; There
he lyes, senselesse for some
moneths (as the heathen Oratour
truly observes,) as if hee
had no soule. When hee



comes forth into the large
womb of the world, his first
greeting of his mother is with
cryes and lamentations, (and
more hee would cry if hee
could know into what a
world he comes) recompencing
her painefull throwes
with continuall unquietnes;
what sprawling, what wringing,
what impotēce is here?
There lyes the poore little
Lording of the world, not able
to helpe himselfe; whiles
the new yeaned Lambe rises
up on the knees, and seeks for
the teates of her damme,
knowing where and how to
finde reliefe, so soone as it begins
to bee. Alas, what can
man doe, if hee bee let alone,
but make faces, and noyses,



and dye? Lord what is man?
This is his ingresse into the
world; his progresse, in it, is
no better. From an impotent
birth, hee goes on to a silly
childhood; if no body should
teach him to speake what
would hee doe? Historians
may talk of, Bec, that the untaught
infant said; I dare say
he learn't it of the goates, not
of nature; I shall as soone beleeve
that Adam spake Dutch
in Paradise according to Goropius
Becanus his idle fancy, as
that the childe meant to speak
an articulate word unbidden:
And if a mother or nurse did
not tend him, how soone
would he be both noysome,
&amp; nothing; Where other creatures
stand upon their owne



feet and are wrapt in their
owne naturall mantles, and
tend upon their dams for
their sustenance, and finde
them out amongst ten thousand.
            Yea the very spider weaves
so soon as ever it comes out
of the egge: Assoone as age
and nurture can feoffe him in
any wit, hee falls to shifts; all
his ambition is to please himselfe
in those crude humours
of his yong vanity: If hee can
but elude the eyes of a nurse
or Tutor, how safe hee is?
Neither is he yet capable of any
other care, but how to decline
his own good, and to be
a safe truant; It is a large time
that our Casuists give him,
that, at seven yeares, hee begins



to lye; Vpon time and
tutorage, what devises hee
hath to feed his appetite?
what fetches to live? And if,
now, many successions of experiments
have furnisht him
with a thousand helps, yet, as
it is in the text (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) What
is Adam, and the son of Enosh?
How was it with the first
man? how with the next?
Could we look so far back as
to see Adam and Eve, when
they were new turned out of
Paradise; in dignam exilio terram
(as Nazianzen speakes of
his Pontick habitation) Oh
that hard-driven, and miserable
paire! The perfection of
their invention and judgement
was lost in their sinne;
their soule was left no lesse



naked then the body. How
wofully doe we thinke they
did scramble to live? they had
water and earth before them,
but fire, an active and usefull
element, was yet unknowne;
Plants they had, but metalls
whereby they might make
use of those plants, and redact
them to any forme, for instruments
of work, were yet
(till Tubal-cain) to seek. Here
was Adam delving with a
jawbone, and harrowing
with sticks tyed uncouthly
together, and paring his nailes
with his teeth: there Eve making
a comb of her fingers;
&amp; tying her raw-skin'd breeches
together with rindes of
trees, or pinning them up
with thornes. Here was Adam


               
tearing off some arme of
a tree, to drive in those stakes
which he hath pointed with
some sharp flint; there Eve fetching
in her water in a shell;
Here Adam the first mid▪ wife
to his miserable consort, and
Eve wrapping her little one in
a skin, lately borrowed from
some beast; and laying it on a
pillow of leaves, or grasse;
Their fist was their hammer,
their hand their dish, their
armes and legges their ladder,
heaven their Canopy, and
earth their fetherbed; &amp; now
(
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) What is Adam? In
time Art beganne to improve
nature; Every dayes experiments
brought forth something;
and now, man durst
affect to dwell, not safe, but



faire; to be clad, not warme
but fine; and the palate waxt
by degrees, wanton, &amp; wilde;
the back and the belly strove
whether should be more luxurious;
and the eye affected
to be more prodigal then they
both; and ever since, the ambition
of these three hath
spent, &amp; wearyed the world;
so as in the other extreme we
may well cry out, Lord what is
man?
            
            For, to rise up with his age
and the worlds now, when
man is grown ripe in all professions,
an exquisite artist, a
learned Philosopher, a stout
champion, a deep politician,
whither doth he bend all his
powers, but to attain his own
ends, to crosse anothers? to



greaten himselfe, to supplant a
rivall, to kill an enemy, to embroile
a world; Mans heart (as
Bernard well) is a mill, ever
grinding some grist, or other,
of his own devise; and I may
adde, if there bee no graine to
work upon, sets it self on fire.
Lord what is man? (even after
the accession of a professed
Christianity) but a butcher of
his owne kinde? Seneca told
his Lucilius (the same that
Iob hath) that vivere militare
est; It is true now not morally
but literally: What a wofull
shambles is Christendome it
selfe ever since the last Comet
becomne. Fryer Dominick
was according to his mothers
dream a dog with a fire brand
in his mouth, sure ever since,



religion hath been fiery and
bloody. Homicida cucurbitarum,
was the style that S. Austin
gave to Manicheus; now every
man abroad strives to be
bomicida Christianorum: As if
men were growne to the resolution
of the old Tartars, of
whō 
               Haytonus; they thought
it no sin to kill a man, but not
to pull off their horses bridle
when hee should feed, this
they held mortall. What hils
of carcasses are here? What rivers
of blood; At tu domine
usquequo? How long Lord,
how long shall men play the
men in killing? and seek glory
in these ambitious murders.
Oh stay, stay thou preserver
of men, these impetuous
rages of inhumane mankinde,



and scatter the people
that delight in warre: And
blessings be upon the anointed
head of the King of our
peace, under whose happy
scepter we enjoy these calme
&amp; comfortable times, whiles
all the rest of the world is
weltring in blood, and scorching
in their mutuall flames;
May all the blessings of our
peace returne upon him, who
is (under God) the author of
these blessings, and upon his
seed for ever, and ever.
            How willingly would I
now forget (as an old man
easily might) to turne back to
the dispositions, studies, courses
of man, commonly bent
upon the prosecution whether
of his lust, or malice: Wo▪

is me, how is his time spent?
In hollow visits, in idle courtings,
in Epicurean pamperings,
in fantastick dressings, in
lawlesse disports, in deepe
plots, crafty conveyances,
quarrelous law-suits, spightfull
underminings, corrading
of riches, cozēing in cōtracts,
revenging of wrongs, suppressing
the emulous, oppressing
inferiours, mutining against
authority, eluding of
lawes, and what shall I say?
in doing all but what hee
should, so as in this, man approves
Polybius his word too
true, that he is both the craftiest
of all creatures, &amp; most vicious;
and in the best and all
his wayes makes good the
word in my text (even in this



sense) Man is like unto vanity;
yea like is not the same; Man
is altogether vanity. Psal. 39. 6.
Indeed so more then vanity
that we may rather say vanity
is like to man; What a deale
of variety of vanity here is;
Ones is a starved vanity, anothers
a pamperd one; ones a
loviall vanity, anothers a sullen
one; ones a silken vanity,
anothers a ragged one; ones a
carelesse vanity, anothers a
carking; and all these rivulets
runne into one common
Ocean of vanity, at last,
universa vanitas omnis homo;
In this busie variety doth
he weare out the time and
himselfe, till age or sicknesse
summon him to his dissolution;
But the whiles, in

the few minutes of our life,
how are our drams of pleasure
lost in our pounds of gal;
Anguish of soule, troubles of
minde, distempers of body,
losses of estate, blemishes of
reputation, miscariages of
children, mis-casualties, unquietnesse,
paines, griefes,
feares take up our hearts, and
forbid us to enjoy, not happinesse,
but our very selves; so as
our whole life sits like Augustus,
inter suspiria &amp; lachrymas
betwixt sighes and teares; and
all these hasten us on to our
end; and wo is me, how soon
is that upon us? I remember
Gerson brings in an Englishman
asking a Frenchman
Quot annos habes? (how many
yeares are you?) a usuall latin



phrase when we aske after a
mans age; his answer is Annos
non habeo; I am of no yeares at
al, but death hath forborn me
these fifty; Surely we cannot
make account of one minute:
besides the vanity of unprofitablenesse,
here is the vanity
of transitorinesse. How doth
the momentaninesse of this
misery adde to the misery;
what a flowre, a vapour, a
smoke, a bubble, a shadow, a
dreame of a shadow our life
is? We are going, and then a
carelesse life is shut up in a
disconsolate end, and God
thinkes it enough to threat,
Ye shall die like men: Alas, this
wormeaten apple soon falls;
vitreum hoc corpusculum (as Erasmus
termes it) is soone



crackt, and broken. It is not
for every one to have his
soule suckt out of his mouth
with a kisse as the Iewes say
of Moses. He that came into
the world with cryes, goes
out with groanes; The pangs
of death, the anguish of conscience,
the shrieking of
friends, the frights of hell
meet now together to render
him perfectly miserable, and
now, Lord, what is man? Well,
he dyes, saith the Psalmist, and
then all his thoughts perish;
Lo what a word here is? All
his thoughts perish. What is man
but for his thoughts? Those
are the only improvement of
reason, and that in an infinite
variety: One bends his
thoughts upon some busie



controversies, perhaps nec gemino
ab ovo; another, upon
some deep plot of State to be
molded up (like to China clay)
some hundred yeares after,
another, hath cast models in
his brain of some curious fabrick
wherewith he will enrich
the surface of the earth;
another hath in his active
imagination hookt in his
neighbours inheritance, and
takes care to convey it; one
studies Art, another fraud, another
the art of fraud; one is
laying a foundation for future
greatnesse, as low as hell; another,
is laying on a gilded roof
where is no firme foundation,
each one is taken up with
severall thoughts, when hee
dies all those thoughts perish;



all those castles in the ayre
(
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , as Aristophanes his
word is) vanish to nothing;
onely his ill thoughts stick by
him, and wait on his soule to
his hell: But I have not yet
done with the body: Rameses
which signifieth wormes,
is our last station in this wildernesse;
yet one step lower
e corpore vermes, e vermibus
faetor, as Bernard well: Hee
that was rotted with disorder,
would be sweetned with
odors; but it is more then all
Arabia can doe, neither is
there more horror in the face
of death, then in his breath,
noysomenesse. Lord what is
man? But alas, it is well for
this part that it is for the time
senselesse; the living Spirit



payes the while for all, which
if it bee but a mere mans, is
hurried by divels immediatly,
into the dreadfull regions
of horror, and death, and
there lyes for ever, and ever,
and ever in unsufferable, unutterable,
unconceivable torments,
without all possibility
of intermission, of mitigation.
Oh wo wo wo to those
miserable soules that ever they
were created. And now, Lord
what is man?
            
            Ye have seen man divided
by his times, in his ingresse,
progresse, egresse; or, in Lactantius
his termes, in his originall,
state, dissolution: See
him now, at one glance, divided
in his parts, Bernards two
mites, A body and a soule;



               What is man then? A goodly
creature he is: When I looke
upon this stirring pile, I can
say, I am fearefully, and wonderfully
made. Lord, I can
admire thee in me, and yet abase
my selfe: thou art so
much more wonderfull in
thy workes, by how much I
am viler: What is this body
of mine but a piece of that I
tread upon, a sack of dust (if
not saccus stercorum as Bernard)
a sewer of ill humours,
a magazine of diseases, a feast
of wormes; And as for that
better part, the inmate of this
ragged cottage, though as it
proceeds from thee, it is a pure
immortall spirit, a sparke of
thine heavenly fire, a glimpse
of thy divine light, yet as it is



mine, how can I pity it? Alas,
how darke it is with ignorance?
For what have I here
but that cognitionem nocturnam,
which Aquinas yeelds to
worse creatures, how foule
and muddy with error, nec
quis error turpitudine caret,
there is no errour that is not
nasty as Austin truly; how
earthly and grosse with mis-affections;
praecedit carnem in
crimine, it ushers the flesh in
sinfull courses, as Bernard;
how as unlike thee, as like
him that marred it? And, if
both parts in their kind were
good, yet put together they
are naught; Earth is good, and
water is good, yet put together
they make mudd and
mire. Lord then what is man?
            
            
               
Such is nature now in her
best dresse, but if ye look upon
her in the worst of her depravation,
ye shall not more
wonder at her misery, then
her ugly deformity; (Materia
vilis, operatio turpis as Bernard)
and in a detestation (more
then pity) of her loathlinesse,
shall cry out, Lord what is
man? I doe not tell you of
bloody Turkes, man-eating
Canniballs, mungrell Troglodites
feeding upon buried
carcasses, Patavian pandarisme
of their own daughters,
or of miserable Indians
idolatrously adoring their divellish
Pagodes, I meddle not
with these remote prodigies
of lost humanity; Yet these
goe for men too, I speak of



more civill wickednesse, incident
to the ordinary courses
of men. It is sweetly said of
S. Chrysostome; Alas, what is
sicknesse, what is blindnesse,
nihil sunt ista ô homo; These are
nothing, unum duntaxat malum
est peccare, there is no evill to
sin: If then man be such, as
man, what is he as a sinner?
when his eyes are the burning
glasses of concupiscence,
his tongue a razor of detraction,
his throat an open sepulcher
of good names or patrimonies,
his heart a mint of
treasons, and villanies, his
hands the engines of fraud
and violence; Shortly, when
he is debaucht with lust, with
riot, with intemperance; transported
with pride, insolence,



fury; pardon mee, now, man
is a beast, Psal. 74. that is yet
too easie, a monster; yet once
more pardon mee, a divell; if
the word seeme too harsh, it
is my Saviours unus vestrum
diabolus, one of you is a divel;
In this case, his best is vanity,
his next wickednesse, his
worst is despaire and damnation.
Is there any of you
now that heares me this day,
that findes cause to be in love
with, or proud of himselfe as
a man? Let me see him, and
blesse my selfe: Surely, if there
be glory in shame, power in
impotence, pleasure in misery,
safety in danger, beauty in deformity,
he hath reason. I remember
the learned Chancellor
of Paris, when in his



tract upon the Magnificat, hee
describes beauty, to be conformitas
exemplaris; hee instances
that if we see a toad well and
lively pictured, We say Ecce
pulchrè pictum bufonem; Oh the
loathly beauty of our conformity,
to the naturall condition
of man, yea of Satan in him.
The philosopher did well to
thanke God that hee was a
man, but, if I had beene by
him, I should have bidden
him to bewaile himselfe that
he was but a man; and, I say
to every of you, whom I
now see, and speak unto; that
if ye be but men, it had beene
better ye had never been; If
men, ye are but 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . 1 Cor. 3.
3. so the vulgar turnes it, men
are but flesh, &amp; flesh is a title



given to the Egyptian horses,
by way of disparagement
too; Their horses are but
flesh Esa. 31. 3. and flesh and
blood cannot inherite the
Kingdome of God, it can, it
doth, it must inherite misery,
sorrow, corruption, torment;
It cannot claime, it cannot
hope, for more, for other patrimony.
Oh then, as you
tender your owne eternall
safety, be not quiet till yee bee
more then men; till yee have
passed a new birth; It was
wise Zenoes word, Difficile
est hominem exuere; it is hard to
put off the man; hard, but necessary,
off hee must, Nisi me
mutassem was Socrates his
word; till then, your condition,
(what ever it may bee in



civill and secular regards) is
unexpressibly wofull. That
same interior cordis homo, the
inner man of the heart (the
phrase whereof S. Ambrose
doth so much wonder at in
S. Peter) is that, which ye must
both finde, and look to; Otherwise,
let your outside bee
never so beautifull, never so
glorious, ye are no better then
misery it selfe. Downe then,
dust and ashes, downe with
those proud plumes of the
vainmiscōceits of thine own
goodlinesse, beauty, glory:
Thinke thy selfe but so vile as
thou art, there will bee more
danger of thy selfe contempt:
Would our vaine dames bestow
so much curious cost on
this woful piece, if they could



see themselves, as well as their
glasses? Who is so foolish to
cast away gilding upon a
clay wall, or a crackt pitcher;
yea to enamell a bubble?
would our gallants so overpamper
this wormes meat, if
they could be sensible of their
owne vilenesse? The Chancellor
of Paris tells us of King
Lewes the Saint, that he regarded
not, quam delicato cibo stercus
conficeretur, nec coquus vermium
esse volebat; hee would
be no cook for the wormes;
such would bee our resolution,
if wee knew our selves.
Oh seasonable and just prayer
of David! Let them know
they are but men! Could they
know this, how many insolencies,
and proud out-rages



would be spared? how many
good houres, how many
useful creatures would escape
their luxurious wast?
            It is out of mere ignorance
that man is so over-glad of
himselfe, so puffed up above
his brethren; There are but
two things, as one notes well,
that the naturall man is most
proud of, Knowledge, and
Power; Surely if he had one
of these to purpose, hee could
be proud of neither, know
thy self, O man, and be proud
if thou canst. Why then doth
the rich Landlord grate upon
his poore scraping Tenant?
Why doth the silken courtier
brow-beat his russet countriman?
Why do potent Lords
(decepti floridate purpurae as Ambrose


               
speakes) trample upon
that peasantly mold, which
nature hath, not in kinde, differenced
from their owne;
since, if great ones could bee
more men, they would bee
more miserable. Why do we,
how dare we insult on each
other since wee are all under
one common doome of miserable
mortality? Why doe
we fixe our thoughts upon
these cottages of clay, which
are every houre going into
dust, and not make sure
work for those glorious and
eternall mansions wherein
dwells our interminable, and
incomprehensible blessednesse,
longing that this mortall
may put on immortality,
this corruptible incorruption,



Come Lord Jesus, come
quickly.
            Doe not thinke now that
I have all this while done, as
I have seen some in a throng,
or as hood-winkt boyes in
their sport struck my friends.
The regenerate man is an
Angelical creature; And man,
what ever he bee in other regards,
yet, as he comes out of
Gods mold, is the great master-piece
of his Creator,
(
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) thou hast taken
knowledge of him: and
(
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) reputasti eum; thou
makest account of him:
Turne your eyes then from
mans vilenesse, to the more
pleasing object of Gods mercy;
&amp;, as you have seen man in
the dust of his abasement, so



now, see him in the throne
of his exaltation: This grain
after a little frost-biting will
sprout up the more; If elsewhere,
the Psalmist say, Elevans
allisisti; here it is allisum
elevasti.
            
            It is a great word; thou takest
knowledge of him; Alas,
what knowledge do we take
of the gnats, that play in the
sun, or the Ants, or wormes,
that are crawling in our
grounds? yet the disproportion
betwixt us and them is
but finite; infinite betwixt
God and us. Thou the great
God of heavē to take knowledge
of such a thing as man?
If a mighty Prince shall
vouchsafe to spye and single
out a plain homely swain in



a throng (as the great Sultan
did lately a Tankerd-bearer)
&amp; take speciall notice of him,
&amp; call him but to a kisse of his
hand, &amp; nearenesse to his person,
hee boasts of it, as a great
favour; For thee, then, O God,
who abasest thy selfe to behold
the things in heaven it
selfe, to cast thine eye, upon so
poore a worme, as man, it
must needs bee a wonderfull
mercy: Exigua pauperibus magna,
as Nazianzene to his Amphilochius.
But God takes
knowledge of many that he
regards not; hee knowes the
proud afarre off, but hee hates
him; That of S. Austins is
right, wee are sometimes said
not to know that which we
approve not, it is therefore added,



               reputastieum, thou makest
account of him; An high account
indeed; David learned
this of Iob; whose word is,
Thou magnifiest him, and settest
thy heart upon him. Iob 7. 17.
Now this knowledge, this
account is by David here, either
appropriated to himselfe
as a King, or diffused, and
communicated to him as a
man. The fore-text appropriates
it; the subtext communicates
it. In the immediate
words before, had David reported
what God did for him
as a King, that hee was his
tower for safety, his deliverer
from danger, his shield for
protection, his subduer of his
enemies, for rule; and now
he addes, Lord what is man



that thou takest knowledge of him;
and the son of man that thou makest
account of him; intimating,
that this knowledge, this account
is of David, as a man of
men (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) a King of
men; as the Grecians title had
wont to be. It is Gods truth,
it can be neither paradoxe, nor
parasitisme, to say that God
takes speciall knowledge, and
makes speciall account of
Kings; especially the Kings
of his Israel. I have found
David my servant;
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                with my
holy oyle have I anointed
him. Psal. 88. 21. See what
a peculiarity here is: My servant,
first, by a propriety, by a
supereminence. My servant
found out or singled from
the rest of mankind, for publique



administration; My
anointed, when other heads
are dry; Anointed with holy
oyle, yea Gods holy oyle,
whiles other heads with
common. What should I tell
you of their speciall ordination,
Rom. 13. 1. Immediate
deputation, Psal. 2. Communication
of titles, Exod. 22. 28.
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                specially of charge and
protection; 2 Sam. 22. 44.
Thus then being chosen, thus
anointed, thus ordained, thus
deputed, thus entitled, thus
protected, well may they acknowledge
more then common
knowledge and account.
What will follow
hence, but that they owe
more to God then other men;
since more respect calls for



more duty; and, that we owe
unto them, those respects, and
observances, which Gods estimation
calls for from us.
Homage, obedience, tribute,
prayers, lives, are due from us
to Gods Vicegerents; There
are nations of whom God
may say Dedi eis regem in ira:
Even such yet must have all
these duties; But when the
influences of soveraignty are
sweet and gentle, Sicut ros super
herbam, we cannot too
much poure out our selves,
into gratitude to God for
them, to them under God.
Even so, O thou God of
Kings, still, and ever double
this knowledge and deare account
of thine, upon that thy
Servant, whom thou hast



               
                  〈1 page duplicate〉
               


               
               
                  〈1 page duplicate〉
               


               
chosen, anointed, ordained,
protected, to be the great instrument
of our peace, and
thy glory.
            Let us now see the favour
diffused, to David, not as a
King, but as a man: A subject
not more large, then pleasing;
what can be more pleasing
then to heare our owne
praises? what more ample
then Gods mercies to man?
we must but (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ); and
like skilfull limmers, draw
up this large face, in a penny-breadth;
or like good market
men, cary but an handfull to
sell the whole sack. O God,
what a goodly creature hast
thou made man? Even this
very outside wants not his
glory: The matter cannot



disparage it. If thou mad'st
this body of earth, thou madest
the heavens of nothing;
what a perfect symmetry is
here in this frame? what an
admirable variety (as Zeno
noted of old) even of faces,
all like, all unlike each other?
what a Majesty in that erected
countenance? what a
correspondence to heaven?
How doth the head of this
microcosme resemble that
round celestial globe, and the
eyes the glittering stars in that
firmament, and the intellectuall
powers in it those Angelicall,
and spirituall natures
which dwell there? What
should I stand courting of
man in all the rest. There is
not one limme, or parcell in



this glorious fabrick, wherein
there is not both use, and
beauty, and wonder. The superior
members give influence,
and motion to the lower,
the lower, supportation to
the superiour, the middle
contribute nourishment to
both: Was it heresie; or frenzy,
or blasphemy, or all these,
in the Paternians of old; revived
of late times, by Postellus
at Paris, that mans lower
parts were of a worse author?
Away with that mad misanthropy:
there is no inch of
this living pile, which doth
not bewray steps of an allwise
and holy omnipotence.
            But oh the inside of this
exquisite piece. As Socrates,
Cleanthes, and Anaxarchus,


               
though heathens, truly said;
That is the man, this is but
the case. Surely this reasonable
soule is so divine a substance,
and the faculties of it
invention, memory, judgement
so excellent; that it selfe
hath not power enough to
admire its owne worth,
what corner of earth, what
creek of sea, what span of
heaven is unsearcht by it?
how hath it surrounded this
globe, and calculated the
stars, and motions of the other?
what simple, or what
metall, or minerall can bee
hid from it? what eclipse or
conjunction, or other postures
of those celestiall bodies
can escape its certaine
prediction? Yea, O Lord,



it can aspire, and attaine to
know thee the God of spirits,
the wonderfull mysteries of
thy salvation; to apprehend I
meane, never (oh never) to
comprehend the wonderfull
relations of thy blessed, and
incomprehensible essence;
Divinae particula aurae. Lord
what is man that thou thus
makest account of him?
            I feare I shall make this
Topaze but so much the darker
by polishing; but, as wee
may, shortly; Next to that the
tongue hath not skill enough
to tell the wonders of it selfe.
That little filme the interpreter
of the soule how sweete
notes, how infinite varieties
of expressions can it forme;
and wel-neare utter what



ever the mind can conceive; where
other creatures cā but bleat, or bellow,
or bray, or grunt, not exceeding
the rude uniformity of their
own naturall soūd: By this, we can
both understād our selves, &amp; blesse
our maker; whence it is that David
justly styles his tongue, his glory.
            Besides his person, how hast
thou, ô God, ennobled him with
priviledges of his condition? How
hast thou made him the sole survayor
of heaven, the Lord of the
creatures, the commander of the
earth, the charge of Angels?
Lord, what is man that thou makest
this high account of him?
            
            But, what is all this, yet, in comparison
of what thou hast done
for our soules? I am now swallowed
up, O God, with the wōder,
and astonishment of thy unconceiveable



mercies. What shall I say,
that ere the world was, thou lovedst
man that should be; with an
everlasting love hast thou embraced
him, whō thou madst happy,
and foresawest forlorn, and miserable.
The Angels fel, thou lettedst
them goe; Man fell; and, oh thou
blessed Son of the eternall Father,
thou wouldst rather divest thy
self of the robes of heavenly glory,
and come down, and put on these
rags of our flesh, &amp; therein indure
the miseries of a servile life, the
scorns of wretched men, the pains
of a bitter, and accursed death, the
wrath of thy blessed, and coessentiall
Father, then men should not
be recovered; By thy stripes are we
healed, by thy blood we are redeemed,
by thy death we are quickened,
by thy Spirit wee are renewed,



by thy merits we are saved; and
now Lord, what an account is this
thou hast made of man?
            What a wonderfull honor is this
to which thou hast advanced us?
By thee, O Saviour, we are not only
reconciled to God, but of strangers
are become servāts of the high
God. Acts 16. 17. Servants? yea
friends. Iames 2. 23. yea sons; the
sons of the highest. Luc. 6. 35. Sons?
yea heires, Haeredes cum re as S. Ambrose;
coheires with Christ, Rom. 8.
coinheritors of immortall glory.
1 Pet. 3. 22.
            
            Yea, that, which all the Angels
of heaven stand stil amazed at, and
can never bee satisfied with admiring,
thou hast caryed up this humane
nature of ours into the inseparable
union with the ever glorious,
and blessed Godhead, to be adored



of all principalities, &amp; powers,
and thrones, and dominions
of heaven.
            Lo I, that even now could have
beene sory that I was a man, begin
now to be holily proud of my cō
               dition;
and know not whether I
may change the man for the Angel.
Pardon me, ye glorious Spirits;
I durst not speake thus big of my
selfe, but in the right of my Saviour,
I dare, and must; non assumpsit
Angelum sed hominem; Howsoever
man is lower then you; (Alas what
should dust &amp; ashes talk of comparing
with spirituall &amp; heavenly
powers?) yet I am sure the Son of
man is above you; In him will I
glory: In it selfe your nature is so
much above ours, as it is more spirituall,
and nearer to your infinite
Creator: but if the Sonne of God



hath advanced our nature above
yours in uniting it to the deity, we
cannot so much praise his mercy
as you do for us. Yea O ye blessed
Angels (whose greatnesse though
we must not adore, yet we cannot
but awfully acknowledge with
due veneration) I may boldly say,
ye hold it in no scorn to be (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ,)
serviceable spirits to
the behoof of us weak and sinfull
men. Heb. 1. ult. Ye behold the face
of our heavenly father for us. Mat.
18. Ye beare us in your armes that
we dash not our feet against the
stones of offence. Ps. 91. Yee pitch
your tents about us for our defence:
Ye rejoyce in heaven at our
conversion; Ye cary up our parting
soules into the bosome of Abraham.
As this is a wonderfull joy and
honor to us; so can it be no derogation



from your celestiall glory and
magnificence, since he whom yee
professe to serve with us professes
that he the Son of man came not
to be served; but to serve. Oh now
what can we want whē we have
such purveiors? What can we feare
whiles wee have such Gardians?
whiles we have such conveyance
what can let us from ascending
into our heaven?
            How justly doe we now exult
in the glory of man-hood, thus attended,
thus united? But, soft, that
our rejoycing be not vain, whiles
our nature is thus glorious, our
person may be miserable enough.
Except we bee in Christ, united to
the Son of God, wee are never the
better for the uniting of this man-hood
to God: Where should ambition
dwel but at a Court? Oh, be



ye ambitious of this honor, which
will make you everlastingly happy.
What ever become of your
earthly greatnes, strive to be found
in Christ, to be partakers of the divine
nature, to be favourites of heaven.
It is a great word that Zozomen
speakes of Apollonius, that hee
never askt any thing in all his life,
of God, that he obtained not; if
we follow his rule, we shall bee
sure to bee no lesse happy. And
now being thus dignified by the
knowledge, by the accoūt of God,
how should wee strive to walke
worthy of so high favours, both
in the duty of selfe-estimation, and
of gratitude.
            Selfe-estimation. For if God
make such account of us, why do
not we make high account of our
selves? I know I doe now spurre a



free horse, when I wish every man
to think wel of one; but there is an
holy pride, that I must commend
unto you, with S. Ierom; a pride as
good, as the other is sinfull; that,
since God hath so advanced you,
you should hold your selves too
good to be the drudges of sin, the
pack-horses of the world, the vassals
of satan; and thinke these sublunary
vanities too base to cary away
your hearts; It was a brave
word of the old Iewish Courtier
Nehemiah, Should such a man as I flee?
Say yee so, yee regenerate soules.
Should such a man as I debauch
and sin? should such a man as I
play the beast? Is it for my upright
face to grovell? Is it for my affections
to walk on all foure? No, let
beasts be sensuall, let divels be wicked,
let my heart bee as upright as



my face. I will hate to shame my
pedigree; and scorn all the base and
misbecomming pleasures of sin, &amp;
will beare my self worthy of the
favourite of heaven.
            Gratitude. In retribution of
praise, and obedience. O God, thou
mightest have made made mee a
beast, yea the ugliest of crawling
vermin, that I run away from; I
could not have challēged thee; thy
will and thy workes are free, thy
power absolute; and lo, thou hast
made me thy darling, the quintessence
of thy Creation, man. I will
praise thee for I am fearefully and
wonderfully made.
            Thou mightest have past by me
as an out-cast reprobate soule; and
so, it had bin a thousand times better
for me never to have been; But
thou hast bought me with a price.



I will praise thee, for I am no lesse
wonderfully redeemed; O God,
nothing but man, &amp; man regenerate,
of all the visible works of thy
hands, is capable to give thee the
glory of thy mighty creation, of
thy gracious redemption. The
lowest rank of creatures have not
life, the next have not sense, the
third have not reason; None but
the last hath grace to returne thee
the praise of thy blessed power, &amp;
mercy: Oh let not us be wanting
unto thee, who hast thus superabounded
unto us.
            But this is not all. Thankes is a
poore windy payment. Our returnes
to God must be reall; Quid
retribuam? what should we render
to our God lesse then all? Yea, all is
too little for one mercy. We owe
our selves to thee, O God, as our



Creator. What have we to give to
thee as our bounteous redeemer,
as our gracious sanctifier? Thou
that owest all, take all. Oh that
our bodies, soules, lives, actions
could bee wholly consecrated to
thee; Oh that we could really, and
constantly begin here those Alleluiahs,
which we shall ever continue
above, amids the Quire of
Saints and Angels giving all praise
and honor, and glory, and immortality
to thee O blessed Father
our Creator, to thee O blessed and
coeternall Son our Redeemer, to
thee O blessed and coessentiall Spirit
our sanctifier, one infinite God,
in three most glorious and incomprehensible
persons now and
evermore, Amen.
            
            FINIS.
