            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               At laſt I ſate downe on a grene,
               Vnto a banke lenyng my backe:
               But Phebus beames ſo whot did ſhyne,
               That it conſtreined me to take,
               The ſhade vnder the freſhe grene brake.
               Not farre from me then ſtreight I ſpyde,
               A groue whiche was there harde beſyde:
            
            
               Where as eche byrde, with y• ſwete noyſe
               That nature gaue them to endure,
               Began my harte for to reioyſe,
               Their notes my thought were ſo demure:
               Whiche in ſhort ſpace did me procure,
               My thoughtfull harte for to apalle,
               That I into a ſleape gan falle.
            
            
               But in this ſlumber as I laye,
               My ſpirit receyude no quiet reſt.
               Wherfore I wakte agayne ſtreightwaye,
               So ſore encombred was my breſt:
               Whiche ſought therof to be releſt.
               Thus on my muſes gan I craue,
               Take pitie on your ſimple ſlaue.
            
            
               But then a freſhe I herde agayne,
               The byrdes that ſang ſo ſwete a note,
               To whom I ſayde with glad harte fayne,
               Now Chriſte his bleſſing on your throte:
               And to my mynde it came I wote,
               
                  
With laude and prayſe for to aduance,
               In them the Lordes hyghe ordinance,

               Thy handy workes doe me allure,
               That my harte can ryght well indure,
               For euer in this place to dwell.
               And ſtraight againe on ſleape I fell.
            
            
               But ſure I had not reſted long,
               Yer that into a dreame I fell.
               I ſawe my thought the flowres among
               Fayre ladies three, whiche dyd excell

               Me thought they compaſte me about,
               Standing as in a ſyrcle trayne,

               Dyd farre excelle the other twayne,
               Them to beholde my harte was fayne:
               Forſothe it was a ſemely ſyghte,
               My harte therin dyd muche delyghte.
            
            
               As I dyd earneſtly beholde,
               Theſe ladyes three that weare ſo bryght.

               Of whom I had the knowledge founde,
               By readyng of the worde of God.
               As I behelde hyr in that ſtounde,
               Hyr head at me ſhe gan to nod.
               Then from my harte the heauy lode,
               Conſumde away, with all my thought:
               For hope was come whom I had ſought.
            
            
               Then vp to hyr my handes I caſte,
               And kneled downe vpon the grounde:
               Welcome (quod I) my hartes repaſte,
               That I haue ſought, now haue I founde.
               The healer vp of this my wounde.
               That iuſtice hath ſo fierſly made,
               With thought, that ſharpe and cuttyng blade.
            
            
               She tooke me then in hyr armes twayne,
               And thus to me ſhe ſweetly ſayde.

               Both vertue, hope, and alſo loue.
            
            
               To loue then dyd I turne my face,
               And vnto hyr I bowde my knee.
               And gently ſhe did me embrace,
               Be of good chere O man (quod ſhe:)

               To pardon my rude negligence.
            
            
               That lady then did me beholde,
               And ſtepte and caught me by the hande.

                  For Chriſt vnto his hath made it well knowne,
                  The worlde ſhall aye loue and fauour his owne.
               
               
                  And thoſe from the worlde and ſinne that remoue,
                  It is not poſſible, the worlde ſhould them loue.
                  The cauſe as ſayeth Chriſte, of all this whole ſtryfe:
                  Is that from the worlde they differ in lyfe.
               
               
                  For as in this worlde no mans lyfe is ſure,
                  The vertuous lyfe ſhall eternally dure.
                  Though here they be murdred and (ſene for to die)

                  From bondage of ſinne ſhe doth them free make:

                  With ſenſing or prayer ſhe honor hath none,

                  But only with good wyll and purpoſe true,
                  This honor to vertue, alwayſe is due:
                  For he that in Chriſtes fayth doth not remayne,
                  In no wyſe to vertue may apertayne.
               
               
                  Vertue refreyneth wrath without meaſure,
                  And alſo abſteyneth from carnall pleaſure:

                  Of thynges that hoped are,
                  And a moſt conſtant certeintie.
                  Of thynges whiche are not ſene.
                  For therby did the fathers olde,
                  (As ſcripture doth declare,)
                  Obteyne a iuſt and good reporte,

                  And we through faythe doe vnderſtande,

                  By it alſo howe thynges were wrought,
                  We doe knowledge obteyne:
                  Thynges that are ſene by thinges not ſene,
                  Were ordeyned and made.
               
               
                  By fayth alſo (as we doe reade,)

                  More plentyfull then Cayne:
                  And therby had a wytnes true,

                  And was not founde: for god therfore

                  Wherby he dyd ccondemne the worlde,
                  That ſynne dyd ſtyll inſue:
                  And became heyre of ryghteouſnes,
                  Accordyng vnto fayth.

                  When he firſt called was,
                  To goe into a place moſt ſtrange,
                  Dyd by and by obeye.
                  Whiche place though he, inherite ſhould,
                  As after came to pas:
                  When he went forth he knewe it not,
                  Nor no part of the waye.
               
               
                  By fayth into the promyſte lande,

                  A ſtrange countrey where he dyd long,
                  In tabernacles dwell:
                  
                     
And ſo dyd Iſaac and Iacob,
                  Heyres with him from aboue.
                  All theſe dyd for a citie looke,
                  Which God had buylded well.

                  Becauſe ſhe iudgde the promyſer
                  Both faythfull, true, and ſage.
                  Lo thus by fayth there ſprang great health,
                  Where thought was no recure.
               
               
                  And therfore ſprang there forth of one,
                  That dead was to eſteme,
                  As many folke in multitude,
                  As are ſtarres in the ſkye:
                  And as the ſand on the ſea ſhore,
                  Hir ofſpryng then did ſeme,
                  The whiche without number to be,
                  No creature can deny.
               
               
                  Theſe dyed in fayth, yet the promys
                  None of them dyd receyue:
                  But ſeyng it as afarre of,
                  They dyd right well beleue,
                  That as many as ſo it ſawe,
                  And to the ſame dyd cleaue,
                  Salutyng it by livly fayth,
                  None euell ſhould them greue.

That they ſtrangers and pilgrymes weare,
                  Vpon this earthly vale.
                  For they that ſee ſuche thynges before,
                  Of truth declare no leſſe,
                  But that they doe a countrey ſeke,
                  Ryght hygh aboue this dale.
               
               
                  Alſo if they had mynded once,
                  The countrey whence they came,
                  They had leyſour to turne agayne,
                  To that whiche they dyd loue:
                  But now it ſhewes they dyd deſyre,
                  A thyng of better fame,
                  That is to ſaye a heauenly ſoyle,
                  With God the lorde aboue.
               
               
                  Wherfore the lyuing God hym ſelfe,
                  Eſtemeth it no ſhame,

                  For he a citie excellent,
                  Hath builded for the ſame,

                  To yelde a reaſon of our hope alway.
                  Hope is the meane that men to God drawe nere,
                  without the whiche none faythfull may apere.

                  No kynde of death or tormente dyd deſpyſe,
                  That wicked worldlynges could for them deuyſe.

                  Whiche takes away all doubtfull dred ſo ſad.

                  What ſo before tyme wrytten is ſayeth Paule,
                  It written was vs to inſtructe and learne:
                  That we through comforte of the ſcriptures all,

                  The perfect hope, to hope in God eterne.
                  Lo thus doth God in ſcripture vs procure,
                  Through hope in him of heauen to be ſure.
               
               
                  We knowe ſayeth Paule that tribulacion,
                  Doth bryng forth pacience, that goodly grace,
                  And pacience doth render forth anon
                  Experience, the whiche doth hope purchace:

                  She neuer wyll confound them with no ſhame,
                  But bryngeth forth a lyfe free from all blame.
               
               
                  This pure and perfect hope that we declare
                  The gift is of the Lorde and at his wyll,
                  Whiche none can get by worldly wytte nor care:
                  But with this hope god his electe doth fyll,
                  With whome ſhe doth continue euer ſtyll:
                  Not by mans wyll, but by gods mercy pure:
                  This bleſſed hope with good men doth indure.

                  By office of a lyvly fayth
                  What euer we receyue,
                  Or by the office of our hope,
                  What ſo we doe retayne:
                  By charitie or godly loue,
                  To gods truthe if we cleaue:
                  The frute therof we muſt applie,
                  To render well agayne.
               
               
                  As faith the firſte preferment hath
                  our ſoules to iuſtifie,
                  (For by the ſame we only doe
                  Receyue our ſauyng health:)
                  So loue of vertues is the chiefe,
                  Wherby we edefie,
                  By it we worke the wyll of god,
                  And ſeke our neyghbours wealth.

                  For all theſe yet I were nothyng
                  If that I had not loue.
               
               
                  If I dyd all my goodes beſtowe
                  To fede therwith the poore,
                  Or geue my body to the fyre,
                  Therin conſumde to be,
                  And finally all that I can,
                  Tyll I could doe no more:
                  If I be deſtitute of loue,
                  It doth not profite me.
               
               
                  Loue ſuffreth longe, is courteous,
                  And neuer doth enuye,
                  Loue neuer dealeth frowardly,
                  Nor venemouſly ſwell.
                  Loue ſeketh not hyr owne, therby
                  To deale diſhoneſtly.
                  Loue vnto wrath prouoketh not,
                  But alwayes thynketh well.
               
               
                  In euels loue doth not reioyce,
                  Nor Ioye in wyckednes,
                  But alwaye doth reioyce in truthe,
                  And ſuffreth all thynges well:
                  
                     
Beleueth all, and hopeth all,
                  And doth indure no les.
                  Thus loue in goodnes doth excede,
                  All that our tongues can tell,

                  (After this lyfe theſe haue no vſe,)
                  Yet loue ſhall then in place,
                  Remayne, with gods elect in ioyes,
                  And neuer fall awaye.
               
               
                  Our knowledge is but vnperfecte,
                  So is oure propheſiyng,
                  When perfectnes doth come in place,
                  Vnperfectnes muſt flee:
                  For when I was a chylde, my talke
                  Was then chyldyſh talkynge:
                  Myne vnderſtandyng in lyke caſe,
                  All then was chyldyſhly.
               
               
                  And as a chylde alſo that tyme
                  I dyd imagin playn:
                  But then ſo ſone as manhod came,
                  My chyldiſhnes was gone.
                  Now ſee we but as in a glaſſe
                  By ſpeache moſte darke and vayne:
                  But then ſhall we ſee face to face,
                  When let there ſhall be none.
               
               
                  My knowledge now vnperfect is,
                  Then ſhall it not be ſo,
                  
                     
Then ſhall I knowe as I am knowne,

                  Away they will not goe:
                  And of all thoſe after this lyfe,

                  For euery one that loues ſayeth he,
                  Of God is truly borne.
                  For loue doth euer ſuerly come
                  From God the lorde aboue:
                  Suche as loue not, doe not knowe god,
                  But rather doe hym ſcorne.
               
               
                  In this the loue of god to vs
                  Doth perfectly apere.
                  He (but not we) dyd truly loue
                  And payne for vs did take:

                  For in this worlde we are lyke hym,
                  By loue perfect and pure.
               
               
                  By this we knowe the godly loue,
                  That there in is no feare:

                  The worlde may ioyfull be:
                  And where as kynges by wyſdome rule,
                  Their realmes haue equitie.
                  O aprehende hir nurtour then,
                  Let wyſdom be your foode:
                  And at my wordes your councell take
                  For it ſhall doe you good.
               
               
                  I am a mortall man my ſelfe
                  After the common trade,
                  And am of that ſame very kynde,
                  With hym that firſt was made:
                  And formed in my mothers wombe
                  In fleſhe there was I wrought,
                  And tenne moneths had my nutryment
                  Of bloud that there was brought.
               
               
                  Where through the fruitfull ſeede of man
                  I had my ſubſtance thus,
                  In whiche the apetite of ſleape,
                  Is moſte commodious.
                  
                     
When I was borne I tooke lyke ayre,
                  As doe all others lo:
                  I fell on earth whyche was my kynde
                  In wepyng and in wo
               
               
                  I wraped was in ſwadlyng clothes,
                  And brought vp with great care:
                  For why no kyng can in their byrth
                  Haue other kynde of fare.
                  For all men in this wretched worlde
                  As well the kyng as ſlaue,
                  In entrance, and in goyng forth,
                  No kinde of difference haue.
               
               
                  Conſidryng in my mynde howe that
                  The moſt rude multitude
                  dyd nothyng differ from my byrth,
                  Nor death whiche doth conclude.
                  I me bethought therfore howe I
                  Myght in my beyng here,
                  Aboue the kynde of common men
                  Ryght excellent apere.
               
               
                  For wyſdom pure to vnderſtande
                  Therfore was my deſyre,
                  The ſpirite of wyſdom came to me
                  As my harte dyd requyre,
                  By whom I ſet more pryce and ioye
                  Then by great kyngdoms fayre:
                  The royall ſeates or ryches great
                  With hyr ſhall not compare.
               
               
                  
                  And precious ſtones I neuer did
                  Compare to hir I ſaie,
                  For gould is g

                  And ſyluer is but claye.
                  Wealth and beautie I wayed not,
                  But toke hyr for my light:
                  The beames of wyſdome none can quēch
                  That ſhyneth aye ſo bryghte.
               
               
                  By hir all thinges I did poſſeſſe,

                  That in hir handes ſtyll be.
                  But yet in childyſhe ignorance
                  I could not make dyſcourſe,
                  Of all good thinges howe wyſdome is
                  The mother and the nource.
               
               
                  But nowe ſithe I vnfeynedly
                  Haue learned what ſhe is,

                  Hyr ryches and hir treaſure great

                  Whiche paſſeth all infinitly

                  God hath me graunted wiſdomes talke

Subtyll and full of gentylnes,
                  And gracious alone.
                  She is courteous and diſcrete
                  Quycke, vndeſiide, and playne:
                  Swete, and doth loue all that is good,

                  In althynges ſhe is circumſpecte
                  Wherof ſhe taketh cure:
                  All knowyng ſpirites ſhe doth receyue,

                  All other thynges excell,
                  And therby through all thynges to pas

                  And for ſo muche as ſhe is one,
                  All thynges are hyrs as due:
                  And beyng ſtedfaſt in hyr ſelfe,

                  To vncleane talke and banqueting:

                  Though we ſee none their owne fault fynde,
                  Nor call repentance vnto mynde.

                  Then by the former trade they vſde,
                  With lyuyng decently.
               
               
                  And dyuers artes theyr trade did leaue,
                  Wyth hurt of common weale:

                  More gold to gayne by phiſykes art,
                  And therwyth dyd deceaue.
               
               
                  So leapt foorth Loy the loyterer,
                  That no man myght hym let,

                  The ſuperſtitious hipocrite,
                  Styll helde antiquitie,

                  Thus gayn of gold hath made the lawes
                  Voyde, and of noue effect,
                  The godly preachers rayled on,
                  And theyr doctrine reiect.
               
               
                  Thus is theyr golde or Mammon vſle

                  But all their dedes did rather turne
                  Vnto double diſtres.
               
               
                  For as the common ſaying went,
                  Who ſo a tree would fell,
                  Hard to the roote muſt put his axe,

                  And mocked them lyke apes.
               
               
                  Theyr learnyng in Aſtronomye,

                  Wyth greuous ſyghes it ſayd alas,

But lyke a ſcadell vermyne ſtyll,
