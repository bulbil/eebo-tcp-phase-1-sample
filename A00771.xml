            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               ¶Quū venerit paracletus quem ego mittam
vobis spiritū veritatis qui a patre procedit
ille testimonium perhibebit de me. These wordes be ye wordes of our sauiour christ Jesu
in ye gospell of John. and red in the seruyce of this
present sonday. thus moche to say in englysshe. whā
the cōforter shall come. whom I shall sende vnto you
the spyryte of trouthe yt yssueth from my father. he
shall bere wytnesse of me.
            
               FUll often whan the daye is clere
and ye sonne shineth bryght ryseth
in some quarter of ye heuen a thyk
blak clowde. yt darketh all the face
of ye heuen. &amp; shadowyth from vs
the clere lyght of ye sonne. and stereth
an hydeous tēpest. &amp; maketh
a greate lightnyng. and thonderyth terribly. so yt the
weyke soules. and feble hertes be put in a great fere
&amp; made almost desperate for lak of comforte.
            ¶In lyke maner it is in the chirche of christ. whan
the lyght of fayth (that shyneth from ye spūall sonne
almyghty god) hathe ben clere &amp; bryght a good season.
hath rysen many a tyme som blak clowde of heresy.
&amp; stered suche a tempest &amp; made suche a lyghtnynge
and so terribly thonderyd that many a weyke
soule hath myscaryed therby.
            ¶Suche a clowde loo was Arrius. whiche stered so
great a tempest that many yeres after is vexyd the
chirche of christ. And after hȳ came many other lyke
clowdes. as Macedonius. Nestorius. Eutices. Cliuidius.
Donatus. Jouinianus. Pellagius. Joannes

wiccliff. with other moo. whiche sore tempested
the chirche. euery of them for his tyme. Suche heretykes
saynt Jude in his epistole calleth nubes
sine aqua. que a vento circūferuntur. yt is to
saye. clowdes wtouten ye moysture of grace. whiche
be moued wt the blast of wycked spyrytes. And now
suche an other clowde is raysed a loft. oon Martyn
luther a frere. the whiche hath stered a mighty storme
and tempest in the chirche. and hath shadowed ye
clere lyght of many scryptures of god. &amp; he maketh
yssue from hym a perylous lyghtnynge. yt is to say
a false lyght of wrong vnderstādynge of scriptures.
which passeth not from ye spiryt of trouth. but from
ye spiryt of errour. and from the spiryt of this tempest
of his moost perilous heresye. Ferthermore he
terribly thonderyth agaynst the poopes authorite.
agaynst the generall cōcelles. agaynst ye tradicions
and ordinaūces left vnto vs by ye apostles. agaynst
the doctryne of ye fathers. &amp; doctours of the chirche.
            ¶Our sauiour christ therfore by his diuyne prouidence
forseynge. yt suche pestylent clowdes &amp; tempestes
many shold aryse. to ye greate trouble &amp; vexacyon
of his chirch. for the tender loue &amp; infinyt charite
whiche he bereth vnto oure mother holy chirche.
dyd promesse yt after he had ascēded vnto his father
he wold send to hyr the holy spiryt of god. ye spiryt of
trouthe. yt shold abyde wt hyr for euer. to acertayne
hyr fro tyme to tyme of euery trouth wherunto bothe
she &amp; euery chyld of hyrs. yt is to say euery true
christen man shold gyfassured faithe. &amp; finally to be
vnto hyrī all suche stormes a veray cōforter. accordyng
to ye beginnyng of this gospel aboue rehersed.

                  
Quum venerit paracletus. quem ego mittam
vobis. spiritum veritatis. qui a patre
ꝓcedit. ille testimonium perhibebit de me.
This hooly gospel gracyously offereth vnto vs
foure goodly instruccyōs agaynst these daūgerous
tempestes of heresyes. whan so euer they fortune to
aryse. but specyally agaynst this moost pernicyous
tempest that Martyn luther hath now stered.
            ¶The fyrst .iij. instruccyons by the leue of god and
helpe of this holy spiryt. shall vndermyne .iij. great
groundes. wher vpon Martyn dothe stable in maner
all his articles. &amp; the fourth shall answere to the
defence yt is made for hȳ by his adherētes. wherby
many a weyke soule is in peryll.
            ¶But byfore yt we shall entre ye declaracion of them.
we shall make our prayer vnto this holy spyryte of
trouthe. yt in this daūgerous storme &amp; perylous tē
               pest.
he wyl staye our hertes wt the testimony of his
trouthe. yt we floghter not in ye catholike doctryne of
our mother holy chirch. but fastly byleue suche erudicyons
as hath ben deriuyed vnto vs. from our sauyour
christ Jesu by his apostylles. &amp; theyr successors.
ye holy bysshoppes. &amp; fathers &amp; doctours of the
chyrche. For ye whiche &amp; for grace necessary for you &amp;
for me euery person saye theyr deuocyon.
            
               
                  THe fyrst Instruccyon is offerd vnto vs
of these fyrst wordes of the gospell. Quum
venerit paracletus quem ego mittā
vobis. spiritū veritatis qi a patre procedit.
                  
In ye whiche wordes is promest vnto vs ye spiryt of
trouthe. to be our comforte in all doutefull opinions
yt may ryse in christes chirche ¶Towching this instruccion
thre thynges I wold do. First I wold shewe
yt the instruccyons of this holy gospell ꝑteyneth
to ye vniuersal chirche of christ. Secondly yt the heed
of ye vniuersall chirche (iure diuino) is the pope.
Thyrdly yt Martyn luther (whiche deuideth hȳselfe
from this heed) hath not in hym ye spiryt of trouthe.
¶For ye fyrst Martyn luther can not denye. but this
promesse is made vnto ye vniuersall chirche. &amp; ther
vnto we shall bynde hȳ by his owne reason. he saith
in the booke de captiuitate babilonica. 
                     Qd si demus
vnam aliquā epistolā Pauli. aut vnū
alicuius epistole locū. non ad vniuersalem
ecclesiam pertinere. iam eueacuata est tota
Pauli authoritas. yt is to say yf we wyl afferme
that any one epistle of saynt Paule. or any one place
of his epistoles. perteyneth not vnto the vniuersall
chirche of christ. we take away all saynt Paules authorite.
¶Now yf it be thus of ye wordes of saynt
Paule. moche rather this is a trouthe of ye gospels
of christ. &amp; of euery place wrytten in ye same gospels.
In the vnyuersall chirche than this holy spiryte of
trouthe resteth. &amp; shal cōtynue vnto ye worldes ende.
vt maneat vobiscum ineternū. he shall abyde
in the vniuersall chirche for euer. et docebit vos
omnem veritatem. And he shall in euery doute
teche vs ye trouthe. Thus moche for the fyrst.
               ¶Now for the seconde where I sayd that the pope

iure diuino is ye heed of the vnyuersall chirche of
christ. Whan ye se a tre stand vpright vpon ye groūd
&amp; his braunches spred abrode. full of lefes. &amp; fruyte
yf ye sonne shyne clere. this tree maketh a shadowe.
in ye whiche shadowe ye may perceyue a fygure of ye
braūches. of ye lefes. &amp; of the fruyte. Euery thynge yt
is in the tree. hathe somwhat answeringe vnto it in
the shadowe. And contrary wyse. euery part of the
shadowe hath som thyng answerynge vnto it in the
tree. A mans eye may leade hym from eueri part of
ye tre. tyll euery parte of ye shadowe. &amp; agayne. from
euery part of the shadewe tyll euery parte of ye tree.
answeryng ther vnto. Euery man may poynt any
certayne part of ye shadowe. &amp; saye this is ye shadow
of suche a braūche. &amp; this is ye shadow of suche a lefe
&amp; this is ye shadowe of ye bole of the tree. &amp; this is the
shadowe of ye top of ye tre. ¶But so it is yt the lawe of
Moyses. &amp; ye gouernaūce of ye synagoge of ye Jewes
was but a shadowe of ye gouernaūce of ye vnyuersall
chirche of christ. So sayth saynt Paule. vmbram
habens lex futurorum bonorum. yt is to say
the lawe had but a shadewe of ye thynges for to com.
And ad corinthios. omnia in figura contingebant
illis. All theyr gouernaūce was but a fygure
&amp; shadow of ye chirche. ¶Now than to my purpose.
In the gouernaūce was twayne hedes appoynted.
one vnder an other. Moyses &amp; Aaron. to cōdith that
people thurgh ye deserte. vnto ye contrey yt was promysed
vnto theym. We woot yt that people of ye Jewes
was shadow of ye christen people. &amp; yt theyr Jorney
by ye desert. toward ye coūtre ꝓmysed vnto them

was a shadow of our iourney. thrugh this wretched
world vnto ye coūtre of heuen. But Moyses &amp; Aaron
whiche were the hedes of yt people. wherof than be
they shadow? wtouten doute they must be ye shadowe
of christe &amp; of his vycare saynt Peter whiche vnder
christ was also the hede of christen people.
               ¶And wyll ye se this more manyfestly by .iij. lykenesses.
Fyrst Moyses &amp; Aaron bothe of them were
preestes. Moyses was made by god. &amp; Aaron made
by Moyses at ye cōmaūdment of god. to whom was
cōmytted ye cure of ye Jewes in ye absence of Moyses.
So christ &amp; saynt Peter bothe were preestes of ye newe
lawe. Christ made by his father almyghty god
as it is wrytten of hym. Tu es sacerdos ineternum
scdm ordinē Melchisedech. that is to say
thou art a preest for euer according to ye order of Melchisedech.
And Peter was made by christ. to whom
he cōmysed in his absence ye cure of ye christen people
sayenge. pasce oues meas pasce. pasce. pasce.
The second likenes is this. Moyses was meane bytwene
almyghty god and Aaron for ye causes of the
people. &amp; Aaron was meane bytwene Moyses &amp; the
people touchynge the causes of god. So scrypture
techeth Exodi .iiij. Almighty god sayd vnto Moyses
spekynge of Aaron. Ipse loquetur prote ad populum.
&amp; erit os tuum. Tu autem eris ei in
iis que ad deum pertinent. yt is to saye. he shall
speke in thy stede vnto the people. &amp; thou shalt be for
hym agayn. in thoo causes yt ꝑteyne vnto god. Wyll
ye se how christ was the mouthe of Peter towardes

almighty god. he sayd to saynt peter. Simon Simon
ecce sathanas expetiuit vos. vt cribraret
sicut triticum. Ego autem rogaui pro te
vt nō deficiat fides tua. et tu aliquādo conuersus
confirma fratres tuos. that is to saye.
Simon Simon lo Sathanas hath coueyted gretly
to syft you as a man syfteth his whete. But I haue
prayed for the to thentent yt thy faythe do not fayle.
And thou ones tourned to ye stabyll waye conferme
thy brethren. Se now here wheder christ was not ye
mouthe of Peter whan he ꝓmoted his cause. before
almyghty god ye father. &amp; prayed for hym that his
faythe shold not fynally perysshe. And cōtrary wyse
was not Peter ye mouthe of christ. whan he to the
true waye cōuerted dyd cōferme his brethren. here
note well what authoryte was gyuen to Peter vpon
them to cōferme all the other of his bretheren in
the stabyll waye. ¶The thyrd lykenes is this.
Moyses ascēded vnto ye moūte to speke wt almighty
god. and Aaron remayned behynde to instructe the
people. Dyd not christ lykewyse ascend vnto his father
vnto the grete moūt of heuen? And to what entent
I praye you? Saynt Paule telleth vt appareat
vultui dei pro nobis. to appere before ye face
of almighty god for vs. &amp; there to be our aduocate
as sayth saynt John. And dyd not Peter remayne
behynde to teche ye people. the whiche our sauyour
cōmytted vnto his charge. lyke as Aaron was lefte
for to do the people of ye Jewes. whan Moyses was
aboue in the mount with god.
               
                  
¶Thus euery man maye se how yt shadowe &amp; this
thynge agreeth &amp; answereth one tyll an other fully
&amp; clerly. But now let vs pause here a whyle. I wyll
construe this fygure yet by an other dede of christ in
yt gospel. So it was. ye the Jewes were tributaryes
vnto ye romaynes. &amp; for that trybute ye heed of euery
housholde dyd paye a certayn coyne called didrachma.
So whā they yt were ye gaderers of this trybute
came to saynt Peter. our sauyour bad hym go vnto
the see. And tolde hym yt in a fysshes bely there he
shold fynde staterem. whiche was a double didrachma.
and bad hym paye yt vnto ye gaderers. bothe for
hymselfe and for chryst. Marke here yt this trybute
was heed money payed for them yt were heedes and
gouernours of housholdes. &amp; christ cōmaunded this
to be payed for no moo. but onely for hym &amp; for saynt
Peter. &amp; therby quyted all the resydue. Joyne this
facte of ye gospel vnto yt fygure byfore. &amp; what can be
more euydent to shewe yt Peter vnder christ was the
heed of al ye houshold of christ. But yet thyrdly let vs
here the testimony of some father of ye chirche yt this
is ye veray meanynge of ye gospell. Saynt Austyn in
the boke of questyons of ye newe &amp; of ye olde testamēt
ye .lxxv. questyon sayth in this maner. didrachma
capitum solutio intelligitur. the payment of
this money was heed money payde for the heedes.
And after foloweth. Saluator quū ꝓ se et Petro
dari iubet. pro omnibꝰ exoluisse videtur
quia sicut in saluatore erant oēs causa magisterii.
ita &amp; post saluatorem in Petro omnes

cōtinentur. ipsum enī constituit caput
eorum. that is to saye. whan our sauyour cōmaū
                  ded
this double trybute. to be payed for hymself and
for Peter. &amp; in so cōmaundynge he dyd quyte all the
resydue of the apostles. for all they were cōteyned in
hym. bycause he was theyr mayster. And as al they
were conteyned in our sauyour. So after our sauyour
all they were cōteyned in Peter. for christ made
hym ye heed of them all. Here note of saynt Austyn yt
saynt Peter bycause he was heed of them all. &amp; all
they were cōteyned in hym. therfore this trybute yt
was payed for hym was payed for them al. But yet
by an other scrypture whiche I rehersed before.
Saynt Austyn proueth yt al the other apostles were
conteyned in saynt Peter. Simon Simon. ecce
sathanas expetiuit vos. vt cribraret sicut
triticū. Ego aūt oraui pro te. vt non deficiat
fides tua. et tu aliquādo cōuersus cōfirmafratres
tuos. that is to saye, Symon Symon. loo
sathanas hath coueted to syft you as a man syfteth
whete. but I haue prayed for the yt thy faythe shall
not fayle. &amp; thou ones conuerted to ye stable waye. do
cōferme thy brethren. Upon ye whiche wordes saynt
Austyn saythe. Christ dyd not praye for James and
John &amp; for the other. but he prayed for saynt Peter
in whome the resydue was conteyned.
               ¶Cōsydre now how eche of these testimonyes conferme
&amp; strenghte one an other. Fyrst the fygure &amp;

to saye. Peter is called petra. bycause that he fyrste
amonge the gentyles dyd establisshe ye groūd of our
fayth. &amp; as a stone not easy to be remoued. he cōteyneth
in hym &amp; stayeth all ye frame &amp; gretnes of the
worke of christ. And saynt Gregory saythe. Certe

of the vniuersall chirche. Paule &amp; Andrew. &amp; John.
what els be they. but heedes of certayne &amp; syngler
people. wherby it appereth that as they were chefe
euery man of yt people ye they had cure of. So saynt
Peter was chefe of the vnyuersall chirche. Saynt
Hierome also sayth spekyng of Peter. Propterea
inter duodecim vnus eligitur. vt capite cō
                     stituto.
schismatis tolleretur occasio. that is
to say ye Peter was one chosen out amongest twelfe

to thentent that he beynge theyr heed al occasyōs of
schysmatyke diuysyon shold be take awaye. Saynt
Cypriane forthermore sayth. spekyng of Peter whā
he dyd confesse cryst Jesu to be the sone of god. Loquitur
illic Petrus super quē edificāda fuerat
ecclesia. yt is to saye there speketh Peter vpon
whome the chirche was for to be buylded. But how
shold ye chirche be buylded vpon hym yf he were not
the heed and chefe membre of the chirche.
               ¶All these be of the latyn chirche. holy fathers. all
men of grete lernynge. all men of synguler holynes.
whose vertuous lyuynges be cōformed by miracles
bothe done in theyr lyfes &amp; after theyr deeth. Of grekes
lykewyse. Chrisostome after yt he hath praysed
saynt Paule speketh of saynt Peter sayeng. ꝙ ipse
quifuit apostolorum caput talis fuit. yt is to
saye yt saynt Peter whiche was ye heed of ye apostles
was suche an other and often he called saynt Peter
eximium apostolorum. et os discipulorum
ac verticem collegii. that is to saye ye chefe of the
apostles and mouthe of the dyscyples &amp; the top and
heed of all the college. And Oxygene saythe.
Magno illi ecclesie fundamēto petre

                      solidissime
super quā christus fundauit ecclesiam
suam. vide quid dicatur a domino. Modice
fidei quare dubitasti. yt is to say. Se what
was sayd of our lorde to that grete foūdament of the
chirche and moost stable stone. o man of lytle faythe
why dydest thou doute. ¶yf all these so many testymonyes

bothe of grekes and latyns shall not coūterpease
agaynst one frere. What reason is this? I
truste there is no true chrysten man but yt he wyll be
moued wt the testimonye of all these. specyally whan
they be groūded of so playne &amp; euydent a fygure of ye
olde lawe. and of so clere a lyght of the holy gospels.
¶But here Luther wyll saye that he can not cōceyue
duos summos. Of ye whiche I merueyle gretly.
Sithen it is manyfest that Aaron was called summus
in scrypture. &amp; yf he were summus sacerdos &amp;
Moyses was no whit benethe hym. than must they
two eyther of them be summus. one of them vnder
an other in comparyson of the other people. So as
saynt Paule maketh many hedes sayeng. Caput
mulieris vir. caput viri christꝰ. christi vero
deus. Se here be thre heedes vnto a woman. god / chryst / &amp;
hyr housband. &amp; yet besyde al these she hath
an heed of hyr owne. It were a monstruous syght to
se a woman withouten an heed. what cōforte sholde
hyr housbande haue vpon hyr. yf than one woman
notwithstandynge she hathe an heed of hyr owne to
gouerne hyr accordynge to the wyl &amp; pleasure of hyr
housband. yet she hath hyr housband to be hyr heed
&amp; chryst to be hyr heed. and god to be hyr heed, How
moche rather our mother holy chirche which is the
spowse of christ. hath an heed of her owne. yt is to say
the pope. &amp; yet neuerthelesse chryst Jesu hyr housbande
is her heed. &amp; almyghty god is hyr heed also.
¶But now let vs retourne to our instruccyō. Thus
than ye vnderstāde how that in the vnyuersal chirche
of chryste remayneth the spyryte of trouthe for

euer. and yt the heed of this chirch the pope is vnder
chryst. Bi this breuely it maye appeere that the spiryte
of christ is not in Martyn luther. The spyryte
of euery naturall body gyueth lyfe noo forther. but
to the members &amp; partes of the same body. whiche
be naturally ioyned vnto the heed. And so lykewyse
it must be in the mystycall body of our mother holy
chirche. ¶For asmoche than as this wretched man
hath deuyded hymselfe from the heed of this body.
whiche is the vycare of chryst. how can he haue in
hym the spyryte of this body whiche is the spyryte
of trouthe. &amp; specyally whan he hath dyuyded hymselfe
with suche pryde / arrogancye / &amp; presumpcyon.
whiche is moost odyous vnto this holy spyryte. and
so dispytyously. so presumptuously. so malicyously
contemneth &amp; setteth at nought. &amp; all to raggeth the
heed of chrystes chirche. to whome as to his chefe
spyrytuall father. by the reason of his religyon he
hath vowed and promest obedyence. How can this
man haue in hym the spyryte of god this holy spyryte
of trouthe. And here I make an ende of the fyrst
instruccyon.
            
            
               ¶Here foloweth the seconde instruccyon
agaynst the pernycyous doctryne
of Martyn luther.
               
                  
                  FOr the second instruccyon ye next
wordes enseweth. Ille testimonium
perhibebit de me.
that is to saye. And he shall bere
wytnesse or gyue euydence of me
What merueylous vertue what
wonderfull operacyon is in ye bemes
of the son̄e whiche as we se this tyme of ye yere
spred vpon the groūde dothe quycken &amp; make lyfely
many creatures the which before appeered as deed
who that vewed and beheld in the wynter season ye
trees whan they be wydred and theyr lefes shaken
from them and all the moystour shronke into ye roote
&amp; no lust of grenenes nor of lyf appeereth outwardly
yf he had had none experyence of this mater before
he wold thynke it an vnlyke thyng yt the same trees
shold reuyue agayne &amp; be so lustely clad with lefes &amp;
floures as we now se them. And yet this is done by
the subtyll operacyon and secrete workynge of the
sonne bemes spred vpon the grounde.
Neuerthelesse not euery beme of ye sonne hathe this
vertue. It is a trouthe ye bemes of ye son̄e in wynter
be lyght as they be now this tyme of the yere but yt
lyght is so faynt and feble that it gyueth no lyfe. for
than we sholde haue herbes and trees to growe as
wel in wynter as they now do this tyme of the yere.
The cause of this weykenes is. for the sonne shooreth
so lowe by the grounde that his bemes than
sklaunteth vpon the grounde and dothe not reboū
                  de
nor double in themselfe agayne towardes the
sonne. and this is the cause of this weykenes.

they wyll set tynder or clothe on fyre. And lykewyse
it is of ye bemes of the faythe &amp; hope whan they be
ioyntly compacte and vnyte togyder. yf a man had
suche a faythe and confydence than he myght commaūde
a gret moūtayne to remoue for his pleasure
and this were a myghty faythe. Neuerthelesse yf a
man had suche a faythe yet yf he wanted the hete of
charyte he were but as a deed tree. For saynt Paule
sayth. Si habuero omnem fidem ita vt mō
                     tes
transferram charitatem aūt non habuero
nihil sum. yf I haue all faythe he yt speketh of
all leueth none vnspoken of. yf I haue all faythe he
saythe &amp; so myghty faythe yt by my faythe I maye
remoue at my commaūdement gret moūtaynes yet
yf I want the hete of charyte I am nothyng but as
a deed stok a tree withouten lyf. And therfore saynt
James saythe. Fides sine operibꝰ mortua est
Faythe withouten ye fruyte of good workes is deed.
To this purpose our instruccyon saythe. Ille testimoniū
ꝓhibebit de me. yt is to saye he shall bere
wytnesse of me. Of whom? of christ. What is christ?
Luxvera que illuminat omnem hominem
venientem in hunc mundum. that is to saye
the true lyght ye whiche enlyghtneth euery creature
cōmynge into this world. who shall bere wytnesse
or gyue euydence of this lyght? the spyryte of god.
Quia charitas dei diffusa est in cordibꝰ nostris
per spiritū sanctū qui datus est nobis.
That is to saye ye hete of the charyte of god is spred

in our hertes by the holy spyryte ye whiche is gyuen
vnto vs. hete of charyte gyueth euydence that that
lyght is lyfely. Haue a man neuer so moche lyght of
faythe onlesse he haue also this hete of charyte sterynge
his soule and bryngyng forthe lyfely workes
he is but a deed stock &amp; as a tree withouten lyfe. For
as I sayd though the naturall sonne shyne neuer so
bryght vpon a tree. yf this tree haue in it no grenenes
nor puttyng forthe of buddes and lefes this tree
is not alyue. So whan ye bemes of ye spirytuall son̄e
be spred vpon our soules yf we fele not the sterynge
hete to fruytfull workes our soules be but deed.
               ¶But now to what purpose serueth this instruccyon?
To this. it subuerteth one grete groūde of Martyn
luther whiche is this yt faythe alone withouten
workes dothe Justifye a syn̄er. vpō ye whiche groūd
he byldeth many other erroneous artycles &amp; specyally
yt the sacramentes of christes chirche dothe not
Justyfye but onely faythe. A perylous artycle able
to subuerte all ye order of the chirche. but touchynge
these sacramentes the kynges grace our souerayne
lorde in his owne persone hath wt his pen so substaū
                  cyally
foghten agaynst Martyn luther yt I doute
not but euery true christen man yt shal rede his boke
shall se those blessed sacramentes clered &amp; delyuered
from ye skalaūderous mouthe &amp; cruel tethe yt Martyn
luther hath set vpon them. wherin al englond maye
take grete comforte &amp; specially al those that loue lernynge.
Plato saythe. Tū beatas fore respublicas
quando aut philosophi regnent aut reges
philosophentur, That is to saye. than shall

Ye se whan a bowle is throwen sklantlynge vpon a
wall it slydeth forward and reboūdeth not bakward
dyrectly agayne to hym that was the thrower. but
whan it is dyrectly cast agaynst a wall with a grete
vyolence than it dothe dyrectly rebounde agayne.
In this maner it is of the sonne bemes ye more nye
that ye sonne draweth vnto vs now this tyme of the
yere ye more dyrectly his bemes bete vpon ye groūde
&amp; the more dyrectly they reboūde &amp; retourne agayne
towardes ye son̄e. And by the reason of the nyenesse
of beme to beme ryseth a greter strengthe in ye beme
and a more full lyght. quia om̄is virtus vnita
fortior est. that is to say. For euery vertue yt is gadred
togyder is more stronger. ¶Asengell threde is
nothynge so stronge as is a double / nor a syngle beme
of the sonne is nothyng so myghty as whā it is
doubled and bowghted in it selfe by reboūdyng and
reflexyon. Forthermore of these two ryseth an hete
&amp; a warmenes the whiche is ye pryncypall worker of
lyfe in euery creature. But for all this we be not yet
sure that any tree is alyue to than we se some puttynge
forthe of buddes or lefes out of the same tree.
¶This example yf ye perceyue it maye enduce vs
to conceyue how wonderfully the spyrytuall sonne
almyghty god worketh by his spyrytuall and inuysyble
bemes of his lyght spred vpō the soule of man
or vpon the chirche. bothe whiche is called in scrypture
a spyrytuall erthe. Dominus dabit benignitatem
et terra nostra dabit fructū suū.
That is to saye. our lorde shall gyue his gracyous
influence and our erthe shall yelde fruytful workes.

The bemes of almyghty god spred vpon our soules
quyckeneth them &amp; causeth this lyfe in vs and the
fruyte of good workes. Fyrst they cause ye lyghte of
faythe but this is a veray sklender lyght wtouten ye
reboundynge of hope &amp; the hete of charyte. faythe
wtouten hope is a sklender beme &amp; of a lytle power.
But Joyne vnto hym hope whiche reboundeth vp
to god agayne ad
                        ••
                      que non videntur. &amp; thā is
he moche stronger than he whas byfore. For nowe
this is doubled and bowghted in it selfe and gadred
more nye vnto hymselfe &amp; made more valyaunt and
mighty than it was before. Before it was lyke vnto
the faythe yt saynt Peter had whan christ bad hym
come to hym vpon ye see. he beleued his mayster but
he had no veray fast hope yt he myght walke there.
He was not stronge in his faythe &amp; therfore our sauyour
sayd vnto hym. Modice fidei quare dubitasti.
But of ye stronge faythe yt hath a cōfydence
&amp; hope adioyned. therunto he sayth ī an other place.
Si habueritis fidem sicut granū sinapis dicetis
monti huic. transi hinc et transibit.
That is to say. yf ye had faythe lyke vnto a corne of
mustard sede ye shold cōmaund this moūtayn to remoue
hȳselfe &amp; it shold by your faythe auoyde. this
is a grete fayth &amp; hath also cōfydence &amp; hope adioyned
therwith. A corne of mustard sede is veray lytle
but it hath a gret vertue compact and gadred in it.
So whan the bemes of faythe &amp; hope be ioyned togyder
in one poynt than it is of mighty power. The
bemes of the son̄e whan by reflexyon of a brennyng
glasse they be gadred togyder. they be so myghty yt

And now ye yt be kynges study to haue vnderstandynge.
&amp; ye that take vpon you ye Judgemētes of ye
worlde inforse you to haue lernynge.
               ¶But now lette vs retourne to our mater agayne.
For this groūde he bryngeth saynt Paule in dyuers
places sayenge yt a man is iustyfyed by his faythe
onely withouten workes. Neuerthelesse saynt Austyn
saythe that saynt Paules wordes were myscō
                  ceyued
in the begynnyng of the chirche for the whiche
as he saythe ye other apostles in theyr epistoles
studyeth to the cōtrary parte. But some here thynketh
that Martyn luther lytle regardeth saynt Austyn.
And a trouthe it is. but yet that is a foule presumpcyon.
let hym at ye least beleue ye other apostles
whome withouten manyfest heresye he can not denye.
Saynt James sayth. Ex factis iustificatur
homo &amp; nō ex fide tm̄. A man is iustifyed by his
dedes and not by his faythe alone. whiche thynge
saynt James dothe not onely saye but also proueth
it by dyuers wayes. One is this. Demones credunt
et contremiscunt. The deuylles he saythe
hathe faythe. &amp; yet no man maye say yt the deuylles
be iustyfyed by theyr faythe. How many that lyue
in horryble synne yt yet haue ye faythe of chryst Jesu
&amp; wold rather dye or they shold renye theyr faythe.

but for all that they be not iustyfyed. But yf onely
faythe dyd iustifye bothe they and the deuylles also
shold be iustyfyed. Second ye same example yt saynt
Paule vseth vnto the Romaynes to proue yt faythe
iustifyed a synner withouten workes. ye same vseth
saynt James to ye contrary. the example I meane
of Abraham as there appereth in ye same place. But
ye than wyll saye. Syr be these apostles one contrary
to an other. To this saynt Austyn saythe yt nay
forsothe. But yt saynt James onely contrareth that
yt may be construed &amp; mystaken in saynt Paule. For
saynt Paule meaneth of the workes yt gothe before
faythe. &amp; saynt James meaneth of the workes that
folowe after the faythe. Saynt Paule meaneth yt ye
worke of circūcysyon or of other workes of the lawe
was not necessary for the iustyfyeng of Abraham to
go before his faythe but his faythe withouten them
dyd iustyfye hym. Saynt James meaneth of the
fruytfull workes that folowe after faythe the whiche
gyue euydence of a lyfely faythe and these iustyfyeth
a man. and these he saythe yf Abraham had
not had. he had not ben iustyfyed yf Abraham had
not ben redy to offer vp his sone Isaac at the commaundynge
of god he had not ben iustyfyed. but
bycause he was so redy therfore he saythe. Abraham
ex operibus iustificatus est. That is to
saye. Abraham was iustifyed by his workes. wherfore
saynt James speketh not agaynst saynt Paule
but agaynst the mysunderstandynge and mysconceyuynge
of hym. Of the whiche mysconceyuynge
saint Peter also speketh in his second epistle sayeng.

                     
In quibus sunt quedam difficilia intellectu
que indocti et instabiles deprauāt sicut
et ceteras scripturas ad suam ipsorum perditionem.
That is to saye in the epistoles of our
ryght dere broder Paule be some thynges harde to
be cōceyued whiche the vnstable myndes dothe misconstrue
lyke as they do many other scryptures to
theyr owne damnacyon. Thus ye maye se that dyuers
other haue mysconstrued saynt Paule byfore
this as nowe dothe Martyn luther to his owne peryll
and damnacyon.
               ¶But here one thynge I merueyle moche of Martyn
luther specyally that he saythe that in all scrypture
there is no more testymony agaynst hym but
this one place of saynt James. for it is not to be douted
but many moo maye be brought. And fyrst oure
sauyour in the gospell of Luce saythe. Date eleemosynam
&amp; ecce omnia munda sunt vobis.
That is to saye. gyue ye almes and all thynges shal
be clene vnto you. what is this clennesse but the iustyfyenge of our soules the whiche is promest for ye
workes of almes. yf I beleue neuer so moche and yf
I releue not the poore in theyr necessyte I shall not
atteyne vnto this clennesse. Ferthermore in ye gospel
of Matthew. Si remiseritis hominibus erra
ta sua remittet &amp; vobis pater vester celestis
Quod si non remiseritis hominibus errata
sua nec pater remittet vobis errata vestra.
                  
That is to saye. yf ye do forgyue vnto them yt hathe
greued you theyr offences your father in heuen shal
do lykewyse to you. and yf ye do not forgyue to men
whiche hath greued you theyr offences nor your father
shall not forgyue to you your offences done agaynst
hym. Ouer this he saythe in ye same gospell.
Non omnis qui dicit mihi domine domine
intrabit in regnū celorum. sed qui facit voluntatem
patris mei. that is to say. yf we worke
not the wyll of almyghty god ye father we shall not
be iustyfyed nor entre into the kyngdome of heuen.
Besydes these in the same gospell. Nisi abundauerit
iusticia vestra plus
                        
                           
                        
                        quam
                      scribarū &amp; phariseorum
non intrabitis in regnum celorum.
That is to saye. onlesse your iustyce or your maner
of lyuyng be more better and ample than was ye iustyce
and lyuyng of ye Jewes and pharysees ye shal
not entre into the kyngdom of heuen whiche is to be
vnderstāded de iusticia operum. of the iustyce of
workes. as clerly appeereth of all yt foloweth. Besydes
this he saythe. Om̄is qi audit verba mea
hec &amp; non facit ea similis erit viro stulto qui
edificauit domum suam super arenam.That is to saye. Al ye hereth these my wordes &amp; worketh
not therafter is lyke vnto an vnwyse man that
buyldeth his hous vpō an vnsure groūd. And saynt
Paule also saythe. Non auditores legis sed tactores
iustificabuntur. yt is to saye. Suche as
onely be herers of ye lawe of god shal not be iustifyed

but ye workers therafter. And saynt James saythe.
Estote factores verbi et non auditores tantum
fallentes vosmetipsos. yt is to saye be ye
workers of the worde of god and not onely ye herers
for than ye disceyue yourself. &amp; saynt Paule agayne
sayth. Si secundum carnem vixeritis morie
mini. Si spiritu facta carnis mortificaueritis
viuetis. yt is to say. yf ye lyue after ye workes
of your flesshe ye shall dye. but yf ye mortifye in you
by spyryte the workes of your flesshe ye shall lyue.
And fynally saynt Paule sayth resoluyng his owne
sentence. fides que per dilectionem operatur.
that is to saye. Fay the whiche is wrought by loue.
accordynge to the whiche saynt James saythe. Uides
quoniam fides cooperabatur operibus
illius: ex operibus fides consummata est.
That is to saye. Thou seest how that faythe helped
his workes and how of the worker his faythe was
made perfyt. By all the whiche testimonyes ye may
playnely se that not onely faythe suffyseth but also
loue and workes be requyred to ye iustyfyenge of our
soules. And thus moche for the seconde instrucyon.
            
            
               ¶Here foloweth the thyrde instruccyon

                  TOwching ye third instruccyō it foloweth

.iij. ꝑsones. in ye which they haue instructeth man. of
ye trouth necessary to be byleued. First almighty god
ye fader istructed our elders by his ꝓphetes: as saint
Paule sayth. Multiphariā multis
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      modis olim deꝰ
loquēs patribꝰ ī ꝓphetis. yt is to saye.
Almighty god ye fyrst ꝑsone ī ye godhed many diuers
wayes instructed our fathers by his ꝓphetes. saynt
Paule meaneth here by our fathers the Jewes. of
whom we spūally descēded. for Abrahā yt was theyr
carnal fader is oures also spūal. Now almighty god
ye father taught them by his ꝓphetes. whose ꝓphecyes
all be it they be wrytten in scrypture. yet was
there many moo thinges which they spook vnwrytten.

yt was of as gret authoryte. as yt yt was wrytten
which ye mayster of Jewes calleth cabala. which is
deriuyed fro man to man. by mouthe onely &amp; not by
wrytyng. After this ye second ꝑson ye sone of god our
sauiour christ Jesu was send by his father into this
world to instructe man. bothe by hymselfe &amp; by his
apostles. ye which were cōuersaūt wt hym (as ye gospel
here sayth) fro ye begining. These blessyd apostles
left vnto vs also many thinges by mouthe. which is
not written in ye byble. This thyng may appeere by
saynt paule. whiche cam after them &amp; was not p̄sent
whā christ saye these wordes vnto them ī .ij. epistole
ad thessalonicēses. state &amp; tenete traditiōes q̄s
didicistis. siue ꝑ sermonē siue ꝑ eplam nr̄am.
yt is to say. be ye ꝯstaūt &amp; kepe those īstrucciōs &amp; erudicyōs
yt ye haue lerned of vs. ather by mouth. or els
by wryting. yf saynt paule (yt was latter thā ye other
apostles) to whom these wordes were sayd of christ.
wyl haue his tradicyōs obserued &amp; kept. aswel those
yt he tolde them by mouth. as those yt he wrote wt his
pēne. why shal not lyke wyse ye tradiciōs of al ye other
apostles be of lyke strengthe to make fayth &amp; to bere
wytnesse of ye trouthe. Here ye may se by exp̄sse scrypture
of saynt paule yt we be bounde to byleue many
mo thynges thā be wrytten &amp; put ī ye byble. We shall
cōferme this by Origene which is an aūcyent doctor

to saye. But in the obseruancyes of ye chirche be many
thynges whiche is necessary for vs to do and yet
ye reason why that we so do is not open to al men. As
in example. whan yt we make our prayers knelynge
and whan amonges all the other plages of heuen
we chose the eest parte towarde ye whiche we make
our prayer I thynke not that the reason of this is
lyghtly knowen to any man. Of ye obseruācyes also
and rytes yt we vse aboute ye sacrament of ye alter to
be consecrate. or elles of ye sacrament of baptyme to
be minystred whoo can expresse the reason of al those
wordes. gestures. orders. questyōs. answers yt there
be accustomed. And yet neuerthelesse al these we bere

and execute them accordynge to ye tradicyōs
&amp; erudycyons whiche we haue receyued cōmended
vntyll vs by ye grete bysshop christ &amp; by his children

the holy apostles. Of the whiche wordes of Oxigene
it clerly dothe appeere. that many suche tradycyōs
were left vnto ye christen people by christ &amp; his apostles.
ye whiche we must folowe notwithstādyng they
be not wrytten in scripture. To ye whiche purpose I
myght also brynge the testimonyes of Damascene.

               ¶Thyrdly ye thyrd persone in ye trynyte yt is to saye
ye holy spiryt of trouth was sent fro ye other twayne
to abyde wt vs for euer. and to be as a cōforter contynuell
in christes chirche. whan ye stormes &amp; tēpestes
of heresyes do aryse. &amp; agaynst al floghteryng doutfulnes
to teche vs ye veray certayne trouthe. where
vnto we shold rest. After yt the apostles were departed
from vs the holy spyryte dyd &amp; dothe remayne &amp;
shall remayne with vs vnto ye worldes ende. but by
whome I pray you speketh he vnto vs? by whome
techeth he vs any trouthe? by whome elles but by ye
fathers &amp; doctours of ye chirche. by theyr mouthes
this holy spyryte techeth vs euery trouthe. Non
enī vos estis qui loquimini. sed spiritus patris
vestri qui loquitur in vobis. yt is to saye.
It is not ye that speke. but the holy spyryte of your
father whiche dothe speke wtin you. Saynt Basyll
whan he was baptised. a wonderful lyght was sene
aboute hym. which is not to be douted. but yt it was
a sensyble token of ye holy goost. And lykewyse saynt
Ambrose (whyles he was endytynge of yt .xliij. psalme)
a lyght was sene aboue his heed in maner of a
shelde. which by lytle &amp; lytle entredī at his mouthe
in veray token of the spiryte of god. And so lykewyse

it was of the other. Wherfore it is not to be douted
but in suche holy bisshoppes and doctours of ye chirche
ye holy goost dothe speke. but moche rather ī coū
                  celles
whan many of them were assembled togyder.
For euer as the stormes and tempestes of heresyes
dyd aryse. so they were at length oppressed &amp; cōuynced
by this holy spyryte. spekynge in ye mouthes of
ye fathers &amp; doctours of ye chirche. Somtyme by generall
coūcelles and assembles of many bysshoppes
togyder. ¶In ye coūsel of Nicene was cccix. bisshoppes
in whome the holy goost spake to ye confutacyon
of an heresye yt than sore vexed ye chirche. After that
in the coūsell of constanstynoble was assembled .c.l.
bisshoppes. &amp; in them the holy goost spake to the destruccyon
of an other heresye yt than rose in the chirche.
In the counsell kept in Epheso in a grete cyte of
Asye so named were assembled .CCC. bisshoppes in
whome than the holy spyryte spake to the confoundynge
of an other heresye that was alofte. &amp; so cōtynually
frome tyme to tyme euer as these clowdes arose
and made any grete tempestes. &amp; began to lighten
and shewe a fals lyght of misconstruyng of scryptures.
this holy spiryte was redy by these fathers
to enforme ye vniuersal chirche of ye certayn trouthe.
¶Se than I saye what we haue to conferme those
thynges that be taught vs by the chirche. Fyrst the
prophetes that were instructed by ye father almighty
god. and also theyr Cabala. that is to saye theyr
secrete erudycyons not wrytten in the byble. Secondly
the apostles. whiche were instructed by oure
fauyour chryst Jesu. and also theyr tradycyons not
wrytten in the byble. Thyrdly the holy fathers and

doctours of the chirche. that were enformed by the
holy spyryte of trouthe. as well in theyr exposycyons
of scrypture. as also by theyr general assembles and
councelles had here to fore.
               ¶Yf there were a fourth persone in the trynyte. or
an other spyryte to be sent vnto vs frō almighty god
we myght yet be in some doute wheder Martyn luther
had met with this spiryte by the waye and cō
                  ueyed
hym from vs. But sythen we be assured that
there is no moo but .iij. persones in the godhede. of
whome this gospel maketh mencyon. and that euery
one of them hath done his dylygence to instructe
vs of ye trouthe. And ferthermore. that there is none
other holy spyryt preter spiritum veritatis but
this spyryte of trouhe. and he also shall abyde with
vs for euer &amp; acertayne vs of euery trouthe. we may
be sure yt Martyn luther hath not this spyryte whā
he dothe teche vs agaynst the trouthe that hathe be
taught vs by this spyryte. For he cutteth away the
tradycyons of the apostles. and refuseth the generall
councelles. and contemneth the doctryne of the
holy fathers and doctours of the chirche. and laboureth
to subuerte all the ordynaunce of the chirche. &amp;
namely the .vij. sacramentes. and taketh awaye the
fredome of mans wyll. and affermeth that al thyng
falleth by necessyte contrary to al ye doctryne of christes
chirch. we may be sure therfore yt he hathe some
other wretched spyryte. some spyryte of errour &amp; not
ye spiryt of trouthe. saynt Paule sayth. In nouissimis

                        tꝑibꝰ
                        temporibus
                      discedēt quidā a fide. attendētes
spiritibus erroris. et doctrinis demoniorū.
                  
that is to say. In the latter dayes of ye chirche some
shall go from ye true faythe of christes chirche &amp; gyue
hede to ye spirytes of errour &amp; to the techynge of ye
deuyl. And here note this worde (discedēt). For saynt
Paule saythe in another place. Erit discessio primum.
yt is to saye. Before ye comynge of antichryst
there shall be a notable discessyon &amp; departyng fro ye
faythe of ye chirche. And it is not vnlyke to be at this
same tyme by ye occasyon of this moost perylous heretyke.
¶Here Martin luther for his shrewed brayne
wyll some thyng wrastell agaynst vs. He wyl say
that ye councelles somtyme erre. &amp; that the doctours
full often disagre. And as they erre &amp; disagre at one
tyme or in one place so maye they do in an other. and
therfore he sayth he is boūdē to byleue none of them
all. To this maye be answered yt this reason strayneth
not. as it shall well appeere in lyke. The ꝓphetes
somtyme left vnto themselfe dyd square from ye
trouthe. Nam prophetie spiritus nō semper
prophetarum mentes irradiat. That is to say
ye spiryte of prophecye dothe not alway shyne bright
vpon the myndes of the prophetes. As in example
kynge Dauyd purposynge to buylde the temple to
almyghty god councelled with the prophete Nathan
wheder he sholde perfourme his purpose ye or
naye. And the prophete Nathan bad hym goo in
hande with it. and do all that he intended in his herte
for to do. Omnia que in corde tuo sunt fac.
dominus tecum est. That is to saye. do all that
thou intēdest in thy herte. for oure lorde god is with
the. yet he was deceyued. it was not soo as he sayd.

Shall we nowe for this disceyte truste none other
thynge yt this prophete Nathan sayd besyde this?
god forbede. Lykewyse of the apostles. saynt Peter
whan he sayd to christ. Tu es xp̄s filiꝰ dei viui.
yt is to say. Thou art chryst ye sone of the lyuely god.
he spake this by reuclacyon. and here our sauyour
praysed hȳ &amp; sayd. Beatus es petrus bariona.
yt is to saye. Thou art blessed Peter ye sone of John.
wtin a lytle after he dyssuaded our sauiour from his
passyon and sayd. Abut a te domine. yt is to saye.
Not so good lorde. And in this he sayd wrong. Shal
we nowe bycause he sayd wronge this seconde tyme
not byleue his fyrst sayenge? yt were not reasonable.
Almighty god suffred ye prophetes and the apostles
also somtyme to erre to thentent yt we myght knowe
they were but men. and whan they sayd trouthe yt
that they had of god. &amp; whan they sayd otherwyse
thā trouth yt that came of themself. And so lykewyse
I saye of the doctours. though they somtyme erred.
bycause we myght knowe yt they were men. &amp; that
than they were left to themself. we shal not therfore
denye them generally. And ye coūcelles also thoughe
some one of ye last coūcelles whiche perauēture was
not gaderd in yt mekenes &amp; charyte yt was expedient
though one of them (whiche thyng I wyl not afferme)
in some artycle were permysed to goo amysse.
Shold we therfore damne al ye resydue? It were no
reason. And this may suffyse for ye third instruccion.
            
            
               ¶Here foloweth ye fourth instruccyon.
               
                  
                  THe fourth a the fynall instruccyon
taketh awaye ye defence that may
be layde for Martin luther by his
adherētes. which defēce also may
soone ouerthrowe ye weyke soules
whan they shall here it. Theyr defence
standeth in thre poyntes.
Fyrst they saye that Martyn luther is a man depely
lerned in scriptures. groūdynge all his opinyons
vpon the same. a man of religious lyfe. &amp; suche one
yt for his lernynge and vertue hath many adherentes.
Secondly they saye yt he hathe a fast mynde in
god. and spareth for no mans authoryte to speke the
trouthe. in so moche yt he hath excomunicate ye pope
for he thynketh in his owne cōscience yt those yt folowe
not his doctryne be not of ye chirche catholyke.
Thyrdly he hath a merueylous feruent zeale to god
for ye whiche he dothe labour to cōuert all ye world to
his opinyon. thynkynge assuredly to do a specyal sacrifyce
&amp; pleasure to god therby. This whā a weyke
soule hereth he is in peryl anone to gyue faythe vnto
it. &amp; to mystrust the doctrine of ye chirche. For who
may thynke but suche a man is ī ye ryght way. But
herfore to this the rest of ye gospell yt enseweth dothe
answere clerly. It foloweth. heclocutus sum vobis.

That is to saye. This I haue tolde you before to ye
entēt yt ye shal not quale in your fayth. for they shall
deuyde you from theyr synagoges. &amp; ye tyme shal come

yt euery man yt mordereth you shall thynke yt he
dothe therby grete seruyce vnto god. These wordes
maye be taught of some to ꝑteyne only vnto ye tyme
of ye Jewes. which dyd expell ye apostles out of theyr
synagoges. or to ye tyme of ye tyraūtes. whiche dyd
slee moche christen people in ye beginnyng of ye chirche.
But yf yt were a trouthe. thā these wordes shold
be no generall instruccyon for ye vniuersall chirche.
whiche thynge we gaderd agaynst luther at ye begī
                  nynge
of our sermone. wherfore moche rather they
ꝑteyn vnto ye tyme of ye heretikes. First bycause this
ꝑsecucyon lenger cōtinued thā ye other twayne. for ye
persecucyon of ye Jewes was soone at a syde. and ye
persecucyon of ye tyrauntes had his course for a season.
but ye heretykes hath persecuted ye chirche from
ye ascensyon of christ. &amp; shal do vnto ye comynge of antichryst.
Forthermore ye persecucyon of ye herytykes
is &amp; was euermore perylous. for as for ye Jewes &amp; ye
tyraūtes they were manyfest enemyes vnto chryst
&amp; abhorred his scripturs. but these heretykes p̄tend
a specyal fauour vnto christ. &amp; coloure all theyr heresyes
wt his scryptures. The Jewes &amp; ye tyrauntes
whā they had slayn ye bodyes of christē mē. yet they
sent theyr soules to euerlastyng glorye. but ye heretykes
miscōstruyng ye scriptures of god. by theyr false
doctryne. &amp; erronyous opinyōs &amp; pestilent heresyes.
dothe slee ye soules of chrysten people. &amp; send them to
euerlastyng dānacion. Wherfore these wordes must
rather be vnderstāded of ye ꝑsecucyō yt was made by
ye heretykes. Now than christen man. whā yu herest
yt Martyn luther is a man of grete lernynge. &amp; hath
grete redynes in scryptures. and is reputed of vertuous

lyuynge. and hathe many grete adherentes.
thynke yt many suche hath ben before hym in ye chirche
of chryst. yt by theyr lernynge and mistakynge of
scriptures hathe made suche tempestes in ye chirche
byfore this tyme. ¶How tempested one grete heretyke
Arrius with his heresye ye chirche of chryst. how
gret a murder of soules made he? was not he a man
of grete lernynge. of synguler eloquēce. of vertuous
lyfe in outwarde apparence. &amp; all his opynyons he
grounded vpon scrypture. and so dysceyued many a
soule. Saynt Hierome saythe. Arrius vna scintilla
in Alexandria fuit, sed quia nō cito extincta
est totū orbē populata est flāma eius
That is to saye. In ye cyte of Alexandre Arrius was
but one sparkle. but bycause this sparkle was not
soone quenched ye flam yt rose of it raged thorugh all
ye world. &amp; a longe tyme vexed ye chirche of christ. and
ouerthrewe soules innumerable. tyll at ye length by
ye holy spiryte of trouthe. whiche is ye cōforter of christes
chirche spekyng as I sayd before in ye mouthes
of ye fathers &amp; doctours of ye chirch this heresye was
conuynced and playnly put asyde. ¶But after this
tempest rose vp an other clowde in cotynent. one called
Macedonius. yt vexed ye chirche lykewyse. &amp; after
hȳ Nestorius. after hym Eutices. &amp; so forthe storme
after storme one vpō other. so yt assone as one storme
was pacifyed ye wycked spyrytes raysed vp another
incontynent. Saynt Austyn remēbreth .lvij. capital
heresies. yt after ye ascensyon of our sauiour christ. at
sondry tymes. lyke so many clowdes &amp; stormes rosein
ye chirche. whiche fynally were conuynced by the

holy spiryt of trouthe. And euery of these heretikes
grounded his heresye vpon scrypture. and many of
them were men of fell wyttes. of depe lernynge. of
mighty reason. &amp; of pretensed vertue. &amp; had ye propre
fayth to wrye &amp; to torcasse ye scriptures. to make them
apparēt for theyr erronyous opinyōs. Fynally theyr
lyfe. lernynge. &amp; handlyng of scriptures. were suche
yt they had many grete adherētes &amp; fautours. aswel
of ye bysshoppes. as of ye emperours. &amp; of other chrysten
prȳces also. which were abused by them. Therfore
it was necessary yt our sauyour christ Jesu for ye
grete inestimable goodnes &amp; for the tender loue yt he
bereth to his chirche. shold leue instruccyon &amp; warnynge
to all christen people &amp; to his vniuersall chirche
of this persecucyon and so dyd he sayenge. Hec
locutꝰ sum vobis vt nō scādalizemini. I haue
tolde you saythe he these thinges before. bycause
ye shall not quale in your faythe. what hath he tolde
vs byfore? This. that ye spiryt of trouth shal remayne
in ye chirche for euer, &amp; yt in all suche stormes &amp; tē
                  pestes
he shal be a cōforter vntyl vs. O christen man
here this gracious warnyng of our sauyour chryst.
marke wel what he saith. I haue warned you sayth
he of these thȳges before. bycause yt whā they fal. ye
shal not be ouerthrowen in your soules by them. as
though he sayd. whā ye shal se ye stormes aryse. whā
ye shal behold ye thick black clowdes aloft. yt shal darken
al ye face of ye heuē. &amp; shadow frō you ye clere light
of ye sonne. &amp; shewe a false glysteryng light yt yssueth
out of ye clowde. from ye spiryte of yt tempest. &amp; ye shal
here terryble cōminacyon of theyr thonderyng. Be
ye thā cōstant in your faythe. byleue as dothe your

mother holy chirche. lyfely &amp; put your trust in ye spiryte
of trouthe. whiche shall be your comforter vnto
ye worldes ende. ¶Ferthermore whan yu herest christen
man yt Martyn luther hath a fast mynde in god
ye letteth for no mans authoryte to speke ye trouthe.
&amp; reputeth all them yt folowe not his doctryne to be
deuyded from ye chirch catolyke. in so moche that he
hathe excomunycate ye pope. O wōderful presumpcion.
O madnes intollerable. knowe this for certayne.
yt all ye other heretykes thus dyd. they dyd repute
themselfe &amp; theyr adherētes only to be of ye chirche
catholyke. and rekeneth all other yt folowe not theyr
opinyons to be deuyded from the chirche. So dyd ye
Nonacyanes in Rome exclude ye catholyke preestes
&amp; bysshoppes from theyr chriches. So dyd ye Arrianes
in grece lykewyse. So dyd ye Donatystes in Affrycke.
Neuerthelesse the chirche of christ is but one
vna. sancta. catholica. et apostolica. this chirche
is one hauynge one heed ye pope. whiche is ye vicare
of christ. of whome it is called vna. And though
there be in this chriche many synners. yet for ye holy
sacramentes yt reneweth &amp; repareth synners dayly.
&amp; for the holy spyryte yt cōtynually remayneth in it.
it is called sancta. yt is to say holy. And for bycause it
is not lymyt to any certayn nacyon. but it is comen
to all nacyons. therfore it is called catholica. ye is to
saye vniuersall. And fynally bycause it is deryuyed
from ye apostles. &amp; specyally frō ye prynce of ye apostles
saynt Peter. therfore it is called apostolica. that
is to saye apostolyke. This onely chirche is ye spouse
of christ. all other sembles yt be not of this chirche be
synagoges of sathanas &amp; cōcylyables of the deuyll.

And therfore christen man be not astonyed. thoughe
they do excomunicate and deuyde ye true christianes
from theyr synagoges. For our sauyour hath gyuē
vs warnynge here of before sayenge as it foloweth
in the gospell. abs

yt is to saye. they shal excomunicate you and deuyde
you from theyr synagoges. Thyrdly christen man
whan thou herest yt Martyn luther hathe so grete
a zeale to god. &amp; thynketh in his conscyence yt he is
boūden to do this yt he doth. &amp; weneth yt in so doyng
he pleaseth god &amp; dothe a specyall seruyce vnto god.
&amp; all the soules yt by his false doctryne he sleeth and
murdereth he recommytteth them vnto almyghty
god. yet neuerthelesse be stronge in thy faythe and se
yt in this poynt our sauiour hath also warned ye chirche
sayenge. Sed venit hora qn̄ om̄is qi interficit
vos arbitret̄ obsequiū se prestare deo.
That is to saye. the tyme cometh whan euery man
yt shall murder you. shall wene yt he dothe acceptable
seruyce vnto god. But yf thus the other heretykes
dyd not before. thā thynke yt Martyn luther is somwhat.
Dyd not thus the Arrianes? dyd not they furyously
rage agaynst the catholyke bisshoppes and
preestes. whiche dyd resyste them: and not only by
theyr pestilent errours they infected ye soules of men
but also caused grete murders of bodyes. Dyd not
thus ye Donatystes of whome saynt Austyn saythe
ad Bonifacium. Quicū
                     
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      dura illorū verba cō
                     tempserāt.

                        ••
                     
aut ignibus cremabantur. yt is to saye. Whose
euer set at nought theyr hard wordes. they were cō
                  strayned
wt harder strokes to folowe theyr pleasures
ye houses of ye good christianes. eyther were throwe
downe to ye grounde / or elles were brent wt fyre. And
after foloweth. ꝙ plurimi cedibus eorum extincti
sunt. yt is to say. &amp; many was slayne by theyr
murders. Dyd not thus ye discyples of wycclyffe. all
be it yt for fere of the temporall lawes they durst slee
no man. yet put they vp a byll of artycles vnto ye tē
                  porall
lordes in the parliament season mouyng them
to slee theyr aduersaryes yt resysted agaynst them.
And what suppose ye Martyn luther &amp; his adherē
                  tes
wold do. yf he had ye popes holynes &amp; his fauourers.
whome he calleth so often in derisyon papistas
papastors. &amp; papanos. &amp; papenses in his daunger.
I fere me yt he wold vse no more curtesy with them.
than he hath done wt theyr bookes. yt is to say with ye
decretalles which he hath brent. And so lykewyse I
fere me that he wold bren them or any other christen
man yt he thought might let his opinyons to go forwarde.
And yet in so doyng he wold thynke yt he dyd
grete seruyce vnto god.
               Thus ye may se yt these heretykes. all be it they had
grete redynes in scriptures &amp; were fell wytted men.
&amp; depely resoned. and had also pretens of vertuous
lyfe. &amp; had a grete zeele thynkyng in theyr cōscyence
yt they were bounden to do asmoche as they dyd. yet
were they disceyued. &amp; by ye holy coūcelles &amp; fathers
of ye chirche conuynced of theyr erronious opinyons

And why maye not lykewyse Martyn luther be deceyued
as all they were before hym / and specyally sythen
he wanteth the spyryte of trouth / the whiche all
they wanted. For yf they had had ye spyryte of trouthe
they sholde not haue erred in myscōceyuynge ye scryptures.
I saye not but yt they were redy in scryptures / &amp;
coude brynge the scryptures meruaylously to theyr
purpose and frame them cursedly to theyr opynyons.
but for lacke of the spyryte of trouthe they mysconstrued
these scryptures / and as saynt peter sayth. Deprauabant / or
as saynt Paule saythe. Inuertebant / they
tourned the wronge syde of the scryptures outwarde / folowynge
theyr owne brayne and phantasye led by
the spyryte of erroure and ignoraunce as it foloweth.
Hec omnia facient vobis quia non nouerunt
patrem ne
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      me. yt is to saye. All this they shall do
vnto you / bycause they knowe not my father nor me
yf they had hadde the spyryte of trouthe / this spyryte
sholde haue ledde them to the true knowlege of the father
and of the sone / that is to say / to ye true knowlege
of the prophetes by almighty god ye father spake / and
to the true knowledge also of ye apostles / by whome the
sone our sauyour chryst Jesu spake but bycause they
had not this spyrite of trouth whiche was sente from
ye father &amp; frome ye sone / therfore they were ignoraunt
of them bothe / and by yt ignoraūce they fell to these in
conuenyentes. And so lykewyse hath now done Martyn
luther. ¶Now than here I make an ende. I haue
remembred vnto you accordynge to my promesse
foure instruccyons yt be offred vnto vs of this gospell
gracyously. Fyrst yt the holy spyryte whiche is ye thyrd
persone in ye dyuynyte was sente frome the father almyghty

god &amp; frome his sone our sauyour chryst Jesu / to
he the spiryte of trouthe / resyaunt for euer in ye
chirch the chryst&amp; / to be as a cōforter fro tyme to tyme
agaynst all stormes &amp; tempestes of heresyes / acertaynynge
vs in the tyme of euery doutulnes the veray
trouthe where vnto we shall holde &amp; kepe vs. By the
occasyon of this instruccyon I shewed .iij. thynges.
Fyrst yt this instruccyon &amp; all ye hole gospell ꝑteyneth
to the vnyuersal chirche of chryst / whiche thynge I
proued by Luthers owne wordes. Second yt ye heed
of this vnyuersall chirche was ye pope vnder chryst / whiche
one poynt taketh away one grete grounde of
Martȳ luther &amp; shaketh sore many of his erronyous
artycles. Thyrde yt Martyn luther dyuydyng hymself
from yt heed of this body can not haue in hȳ this
spiryte of trouth. For ye second instruccyon I shewed
you yt the hete of charyte spred in our hertes by ye holy
spryte of god gyueth euydence of ye lyfely lyght of
faythe / shynynge vpon oure soules frō our sauyour
chryst / by the whiche instruccyon was vndermyned
an other grete groūd of Martȳ luthers / whiche is yt
onely faythe dothe iustyfye a syn̄er wtouten workes.
For the thyrde instruccyon I shewed yt ye erudycyons
left vnto ye chirch by ye holy apostles / bereth vnto vs
testymony of ye fayth of chryste / and what thynge we
shall beleue in his chyrche / where also was losed an
other grounde of Martyn luther / which wyll not admyt
any other testymony / but onely that yt is wrytten
in scrypture. Agaynst whome I proued that he
must besydes ye scryptures wrytten / receyue also the
tradycyons of the apostles not wrytten / ouer this ye
coūcelles generall / in whom the holy goost dyd speke

and ye interpretacyons of scryptures made by ye holy
bysshoppes &amp; doctours of the chyrche / by whose monthes
the thyrde persone in the godhede the spiryte of
trouthe spake and speketh / enformynge ye chirche for
this tyme lyke as dyd ye father almyghty god by his
prophetes before / &amp; as dyd his sone ye seconde persone
by hys apostles. For ye fourthe instruccyon I shewed
you yt the defence whiche is made for Martyn luther
by his adherentes wherby manye weyke soules be
ouerthrowē / is clerely take away by ye moost louynge
&amp; moost gracyous forwarnynge of our sauiour christ
as ye haue herde in the ende of the gospelle. And yet
eftsones for his moost excellente charyte he warneth
all his chrysten people saynge and repetynge. Hec
locutus sum vobis: vt quum venerit hora
eorum reminiseamini / quia hec dixi vobis.
That is to saye. These thynges I haue tolde you to
thentent that whā ye daūgers shall be fall yet ye may
remēbre yt I byfore dyd warne you of theym. Who yt
thus often warned wyll yet gyue faythe to Martyn
luther / or to any other suche heretyke rather than to
christ Jesu &amp; vnto ye spyryte of trouthe / whiche is left
in ye chirche of chryst vnto the worldes ende / specyally
to enforme vs of ye trouth / this man goethe fer wyde
from yt streygth way / &amp; is neuer lyke to entre into the
port of euerlastynge rest / whiche al we desyre &amp; couet
to come vnto / to the which he brynge vs qui cū patre
et spiritu sancto viuit et regnat deus peroīa secula seseculorum.
Amen.
